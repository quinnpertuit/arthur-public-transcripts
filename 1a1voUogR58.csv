"68860","71320"," And we're coming back to defend it right now. "
"71680","75040"," So if you're here early, just a heads up on that."
"75420","78260"," I'm still long right now at some calls that I bought yesterday."

"84440","85800"," I had some 434s."
"86160","87620"," I want you to see this right here."
"87820","88800"," Big old cross to the upside. "
"88800","96740"," And we lasted right through hourly trigger came back down to defend the hourly trigger again."
"96960","100280"," So I am long here yesterday."
"100700","102420"," We did have a sell off. "
"103040","107400"," After the initial push yesterday into the stage T yesterday."
"108340","112020"," We traded up to it on the opening bell and sold down off of it."
"112400","114380"," So maybe we do get our trend day today. "
"117950","122170"," Good morning, by the way, trading 47 cents."
"122410","125290"," I was buying yesterday in the 30s, the 20s."
"125370","129229"," I think about my DCA was 26 cents yesterday. "
"129590","130670"," Something like that."
"131370","134970"," So still long right now 100 contracts 434 C."
"135910","139910"," There's 55,000 contracts on 433 C on the opening bell."
"141170","143210"," This morning, I'm only in for 100 bucks. "
"143490","145790"," So we'll see for 100 contracts."
"146230","147990"," I think it's 2,600 or something like that."
"148570","150730"," I paid now trading 48 cents. "
"151210","154750"," So maybe I can make back some of my losses yesterday."
"155170","155910"," I lost a lot of money."
"155990","158890"," It's less like 6,300 bucks or something like that. "
"159610","165150"," So I'm back now like 20, maybe 2,800 or 2,900 or something like that."
"165430","166210"," Halfway back right now."
"168710","169390"," Good morning. "
"170450","172230"," But wait a minute, I'm going to go back and do that on YouTube."
"172750","173590"," Give me a couple seconds here."
"173690","174110"," I got a couple of things. "
"174210","177430"," I got to go over in the background."
"180750","183670"," I wanted to get on as fast as I possibly could for you."
"186090","187070"," Just a second. "
"187130","189350"," I got some technical stuff I have to do in the background."
"200210","204110"," It's really weird to now trade in 52 cents on 434 C."
"205770","209250"," So it opened this morning and went to 41 cents."
"210270","212750"," And then it like backtracked to 36 cents. "
"212950","214190"," I was kind of pissed about that."
"214190","217110"," They repriced them down to 31 cents."
"218110","222550"," And then it bounced right back up to 43 or something like that. "
"225150","229450"," So it's like when you're doing zero or one day, it's it's always directional, right?"
"229970","230910"," You take the money and run."
"231030","234190"," I didn't take the money and run this morning."
"240650","241410"," Hold on here. "
"241670","242350"," China's office."

"335890","336790"," Good morning."
"337090","340110"," So we'll take a look at spy right now spoos."
"341110","343850"," And we'll take a look at a few things this morning. "
"343850","345930"," H Y G blasting up."
"346450","348090"," We could see that yesterday."
"348710","352710"," H Y G kept trying to come up yesterday left behind another gap on it. "
"353210","359350"," Did it did come up yesterday, though, in the this morning and has a cross right now on H Y"

"373030","377650"," I W M is being thrown over rolled over right now spy with a little bit of liquidity grab."
"379430","381910"," I can add some more to this positional line here. "
"394100","396020"," Now I'm long 150 contracts."
"396880","398480"," This is where they like to sell to."
"398600","401680"," I want you to know that that right where you are right in this hourly trigger. "
"401920","403000"," This has been their thing, right?"
"403540","409460"," This hourly trigger trade up to it seller step in and roll on the hourly trigger to the downside."
"410440","412500"," This is their plan every day, right?"
"412700","414220"," Committed this hourly trigger sell it."
"421360","421880"," Morning. "
"422000","422540"," How's everybody doing?"
"431660","433400"," We'll take a look here at the one minute."
"442560","443840"," The second here."
"466850","467370"," Okay. "
"468690","473850"," So we're on two things going on right now with the spy and the spoons."
"474370","477650"," First thing is I wanted you to pay attention to a few things here."
"478730","483330"," First one is that the daily trigger is coming up from underneath like a shark. "
"484130","489810"," I also want you to pay attention closely to put this on a 30 minute here."
"491550","501220"," I also want you to pay close attention to the hourly trigger here."
"502680","503700"," Get this closer. "
"506220","509880"," I'm going to pay attention to this down move right here."
"511120","511919"," Right here."
"513080","514380"," And then this down move right here. "
"514659","518159"," Velocity is beginning to wane for sellers."
"519500","523080"," We're getting very close and daily trigger is beginning to come up over here."
"523900","529700"," So we are looking for a reversal to the upside on the spy at this point. "
"529940","534580"," We're pretty close like this week next week looking for a large reversal."
"535560","537200"," A big trend day to follow."
"538020","543560"," Not looking in any way shape or form for any kind of a bloodbath more or less looking for way"
"543560","544440"," to buy a dip. "
"544680","550940"," Either down here at this 426, 428 or any trade above hourly trigger."
"550940","552560"," I want you to be aware of that."
"553820","556800"," I do want you to be aware that we are selling off the hourly. "
"557460","559960"," But the moment that we trade above and hold the hourly."
"560400","564440"," We should get a pretty fat trend day on that trade."
"564680","567280"," So we're going to go to a one minute right now and pretty close to it right now. "
"567680","570820"," We're at that point in the market where we get a nice fat relief rally."
"572660","573740"," Actually, we're sitting here."
"574260","578320"," So just right in here when you start to see us getting a little long or long on the tooth"
"578320","579000"," on the downside. "
"579000","583020"," Like the more max bearish as we get, we get a fat trend day."
"584600","587800"," So just right here in the place to sell."
"588500","590720"," We want to see the reaction trade here. "
"590860","591740"," This is a one minute chart."
"592620","597980"," We want to see if the bulls can hold this here or if the sellers are in charge."
"598400","602260"," How you'll know if we turn into sell is a break below right"
"602260","608980"," now. "
"608980","609940"," Until that happens."
"610160","612980"," We are long or I'm long here to the upside."
"614260","616860"," You just do not want to see this break below. "
"617120","618980"," I'll snap a line here for you so you can see it."
"623730","624750"," So right here."
"625030","627270"," Ready rung there is that. "
"628670","633700"," What the fuck that is."
"635500","637860"," I'll never use that line horizontal ray."
"638200","638400"," Nope. "
"640320","641260"," It's not a line."
"641540","642440"," It's like right here."
"648010","650670"," So four thirty two thirty four currently right. "
"650850","652610"," You do not want to see a break below this line."
"653350","659090"," And for this trend day you want to be above and defend four thirty two seventy."
"659770","660890"," So right here. "
"666440","667840"," Stops if rejected."
"678780","681900"," Then clarify this because yesterday I was trading pretty fucking sloppy."
"682420","683780"," Look at yesterday too. "
"684320","687880"," I was a little disappointed in myself and not well."
"688580","690060"," Wasn't just disappointed in myself."
"693060","694620"," Kind of know they were pinned. "
"697500","699860"," Yeah I'm like over trading when I don't have to."
"700000","702360"," I even had I even made money on puts yesterday too."
"702960","704480"," This is what a rejection looks like. "
"705640","706620"," The downside."
"707860","709100"," That's that's too many."
"709100","710260"," Just two. "
"712780","714580"," Like the initial break right."
"715260","715560"," Two."
"716980","717040"," One. "
"717920","718480"," Two."
"718860","719360"," Then we're down."
"721420","722380"," That's a rejection. "
"723020","725500"," A rejection is not pulled my head through."
"725820","727220"," Come back up and in that kind of stuff."
"733850","736570"," This yellow line is actually a green line. "
"736990","739130"," And as long as we stay above this today."
"739130","740070"," Bullish."
"740610","743530"," So as long as we're above four three two seven zero. "
"743850","747110"," If the white and red line cross and continue to the upside."
"748110","749610"," I'm completely bullish here at this point."
"750650","751210"," Right here. "
"752350","754810"," The line comes up price continues higher."
"757350","760430"," And we'll get yesterday too because there's a little frustrate with myself."
"760730","761990"," Yes there's a little angry at myself. "
"762950","765730"," And I grabbed some of this liquidity right here."
"766090","766890"," It was nobody's business."
"769550","772930"," I want you to pay attention to this right here. "
"773130","774590"," Here's your cross right here."
"774750","775290"," That's your bullish."
"776530","777570"," White over red. "
"778050","779290"," Nothing has changed from that."
"779410","781030"," You can actually see the white red is underneath."
"781290","781690"," White is above. "
"782390","784370"," Price is maintaining to the upside."
"786170","788130"," Well to yesterday briefly too."
"788430","789310"," Specifically because. "
"790290","792590"," I did grab one of these trades yesterday."
"792850","795090"," I thought like I knew I took the put down."
"795690","797190"," It took this trade down. "
"797290","798210"," It took this trade up yesterday."
"798210","799230"," I didn't realize it."
"799350","800270"," It took that yesterday. "
"800910","802110"," Took some puts down here."
"802910","804990"," But then I was looking for that bounce trade."
"805390","806470"," And I got fucking trapped. "
"806710","807610"," I got trapped somewhere."
"808870","810790"," I took this original one down right here."
"811430","815230"," And then somewhere in here like bot calls, bot calls, bot calls. "
"816130","819110"," And it just fucking ground me sideways yesterday."
"820090","821370"," I got ground in here."
"821930","824350"," And then I was like oh throw some two cent puts on. "
"825350","826870"," And no matter which way we trade."
"827110","828310"," I don't care up or down."
"828730","829170"," Right. "
"829390","830550"," And we didn't get either of those."
"831170","832890"," I got fucking dusted in here."
"833730","835010"," Pretty big hit too. "
"835750","837990"," Pretty big fucking hit to this close yesterday."
"838910","840430"," Then I came in and bought some calls."
"840830","841930"," Bought some calls down here. "
"842730","844090"," Still holding those calls right now."
"844250","845030"," Just added to them."
"845830","847310"," But this pin is brutal right. "
"847590","848670"," I mean just look at this right here."
"849450","851070"," This pin is gnarly."
"851730","854390"," Like we're getting no cash market movement in here. "
"855330","857390"," You like you get some movements in futures."
"857530","858690"," But look at this stuff."
"858850","859990"," I mean this is all pinning. "
"860370","863310"," One, two, three even right now."
"863830","864870"," You're talking about."
"865870","867810"," I mean you can see it right here. "
"867990","868050"," Right."
"868270","868390"," Hello."
"869670","871210"," Just look at that right there. "
"871750","874070"," Like that's no fucking movement in this market."
"874510","875310"," No follow through."
"876830","878730"," On Friday we had talked about. "
"879290","883310"," I think right when we we had traded I think 432 on Friday."
"883310","885710"," We had said put a nice big wide."
"887530","890090"," Fly on this week's trade in Wednesday. "
"891110","892130"," And you can see it right."
"892310","894990"," It's just it's just theta burning and just printing."
"895850","897070"," This whole trade. "
"899530","901370"," Likely into Wednesday at least."
"902170","902650"," Right."
"902790","903610"," You can see it right here. "
"904410","907210"," Matter of fact I'm down to 34 cents right now."
"907370","911330"," So I'm up 6 cents on this trade in total at this point."
"911330","912510"," So just wrecking. "
"914530","915910"," Call put premium."
"916410","917970"," No follow through to the upside."
"918770","921410"," And truly you might think there's follow through the downside. "
"921750","922250"," But there isn't."
"922610","924350"," Non cash market there isn't."
"924690","926130"," There is for like put spreads. "
"926970","929370"," There is follow through for put spreads for."
"930610","932570"," Condors and flies that kind of stuff."
"933310","934990"," But this is just parking the bus. "
"935230","936030"," Let's look back here."
"936730","939510"," On something I want to show you we talked about this too."
"940050","941890"," This is December. "
"942470","944610"," I'm right discuss with you what the December."
"944930","946250"," Opex looked like."
"948590","949630"," Right here. "
"961220","962020"," Right here."
"965530","967490"," So you can see this right here right?"
"967690","967970"," Look familiar."
"968670","970050"," Does that look familiar to you?"
"970110","971490"," Like this is no movement here. "
"972170","973870"," This is like a straight pin."
"974650","975870"," Right into December."
"976150","976390"," Opex. "
"978250","980890"," They came it down or I guess I should have made this larger."
"981150","981350"," Hold on."
"985470","987750"," So here is December 19th. "
"988670","990030"," And you can see right?"
"991430","992690"," No follow through right?"
"992890","993750"," No follow through the upside."
"994150","995090"," No follow through the downside."
"996070","997850"," We resolved to the upside later on. "
"998790","1000590"," But absolutely no trends right?"
"1000850","1001330"," No trend up."
"1001530","1002090"," No trend down."
"1002750","1005510"," We talked about this I think last end of last week. "
"1006070","1008590"," And I'm kind of expecting that same thing into."
"1009150","1011090"," This is a quarterly Opex as well."
"1012270","1013950"," Looks kind of familiar doesn't it?"
"1014110","1015530"," Let's look at right now. "
"1022960","1025480"," See that parking action that's going on in here."
"1026079","1028240"," Bring it down into the JPM caller."
"1030020","1030540"," Right. "
"1030780","1034000"," And even if we go up here or even if we go down here."
"1034000","1037119"," You're still like you're maxed out there."
"1037180","1038579"," You're maxed out to the downside. "
"1039520","1041900"," And it's like this trade right here into."
"1044400","1045880"," The caller on."
"1046700","1047020"," Second. "
"1050240","1052740"," This is the Captain James price target."
"1053140","1054980"," This is the daily trigger down here."
"1055980","1057100"," So you kind of like. "
"1058100","1059200"," One second here."
"1059900","1061880"," The DT is actually somewhere else."
"1063500","1064060"," Or. "
"1066960","1067740"," That's close."
"1068240","1069480"," It's closer right here."
"1069640","1070600"," It's close enough. "
"1071360","1074100"," But you see that parking action that's happening right now?"
"1074440","1074500"," Like."
"1077280","1079800"," And the caller is somewhere down in here."
"1079880","1080680"," I think it's for 30. "
"1081600","1083740"," You have that like coloring action."
"1084680","1086500"," Would not shock me to see it."
"1086780","1087840"," Literally tag it. "
"1088380","1089720"," The morning of."
"1090660","1091560"," That Friday."
"1097700","1100040"," Well, you know, I really want to do this shit today. "
"1100320","1100980"," Like just boom."
"1102080","1105300"," And then come back down here to Wednesday, Thursday, and then Friday."
"1106080","1107720"," You get your parking action right there. "
"1108540","1109880"," But no fall through, right?"
"1110060","1111260"," No trend is the point."
"1111520","1112380"," So I park the market."
"1113260","1113920"," Get paid. "
"1114780","1119380"," Definitely is most certainly do not allow a directional shift take place."
"1120360","1123140"," I'm sure you're going to hear people out there saying things like."
"1123720","1125040"," As soon as this is done. "
"1126800","1130920"," You'll hear people say things like soon as the quarter is over."
"1131160","1133240"," The market is free to do whatever it wants."
"1134540","1134960"," Right. "
"1135140","1136720"," So as you come in and a quarter here."
"1137420","1141260"," You're going to hear things like the market's free to do whatever it wants after this."
"1141620","1142220"," It can go up. "
"1142440","1143060"," It can go down."
"1144020","1144920"," There is."
"1145140","1150740"," I have some questions about where the strikes are on Friday. "
"1151280","1154660"," Is the top strike for 53 or not?"
"1154660","1155620"," Is it lower?"
"1156340","1157680"," Keep that in mind too."
"1158140","1159660"," Keep a number in mind right now."
"1159820","1162820"," 4350 on SPX on that Friday. "
"1164460","1168880"," Would be the top bullishness that I would expect."
"1169320","1170900"," So that's like gives you 460."
"1173060","1175780"," But you're you need to see that if you're a bull. "
"1176240","1177120"," You want to say there."
"1180820","1184820"," If you're a bull, you want to see that number."
"1185760","1191700"," If you don't see that number, if you don't see for 53 and that JPM 4530 and that JPM call"
"1191700","1192300"," if it's lower. "
"1193400","1195840"," Lower your expectations in a big way."
"1197540","1199680"," You need if you're a bull, you need that number."
"1199680","1202380"," You need 4530. "
"1204460","1206480"," Now, if it's, um."
"1208640","1209400"," Hold on."
"1209500","1209820"," Let me look. "
"1244180","1252210"," The stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"1252630","1257150"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flame futures, forex and stock instruments."
"1257670","1258690"," Anything like this?"
"1258990","1259330"," 444. "
"1262390","1263030"," 445."
"1265530","1266490"," That's a sideways."
"1269190","1270750"," 4530 is we're going up. "
"1271430","1273630"," That's the top strike of the three that are coming out."
"1274990","1275490"," 44440."
"1276610","1277110"," 44450. "
"1278710","1279210"," 4450."
"1279650","1280570"," This is sideways."
"1281730","1283850"," It's your top strike that you're looking for on Friday. "
"1284430","1286450"," You see anything lower than that number on Friday?"
"1286910","1287770"," Look the fuck out."
"1287770","1294690"," Let's start looking for some liquidity to grab for a leg lower in 2-3."
"1295610","1298330"," But those are the two numbers that you want to be paying attention to. "
"1298590","1299690"," So 44450."
"1301130","1305450"," And 453 if you're a buyer of this market."
"1313660","1315180"," 31 cents right now. "
"1318430","1320470"," Sellers want to sell this down again."
"1321370","1322270"," On the open."
"1322270","1323350"," Another boring day. "
"1349700","1352580"," I'm going to stop in at 28 cents."
"1354320","1357320"," Just put it in now so I don't lose any fucking money in this trade."
"1358180","1359560"," The flat is over right now. "
"1360000","1361820"," Kind of taking the money earlier didn't take it left it on."
"1371140","1372820"," Still long from yesterday's close."
"1411850","1413250"," I'm getting fucking close. "
"1414530","1415910"," I keep touching the number."
"1456620","1461080"," Yeah, home sales destroyed which we expected right we talked about that last month."
"1463230","1467790"," There was some argument last month that home sales would be terrible this spring. "
"1468450","1470030"," There are people out there saying that too."
"1470190","1475930"," There's some really bad people out on Twitter and YouTube."
"1475930","1478370"," I follow some home sale guys. "
"1479110","1482690"," And some of the shit they were telling me I was like that's not I was like that's not accurate."
"1482950","1484750"," I was like that's not accurate at all."
"1485870","1487950"," They're saying that spring home sales weren't good. "
"1488330","1489790"," Early summer home sales weren't good."
"1489970","1492210"," And everyone that I know in my friend."
"1492430","1496670"," I have a friend group of real estate investors. "
"1497130","1498770"," They all say the market is great right now."
"1499110","1500110"," The spring has been outstanding."
"1506840","1508220"," Yeah, news is on right now. "
"1511340","1513080"," Kind of worn out this morning too."
"1513640","1515040"," Been going kind of hard and fast."
"1516100","1517560"," Yesterday I was still pissed off. "
"1519980","1521440"," So so angry yesterday."
"1521620","1522740"," So I got off the stream yesterday."
"1523780","1525240"," I'm kind of grateful here. "
"1526120","1529660"," Sometimes we're not so let's not talk about having a loss right."
"1531280","1535210"," Sometimes I'll have a loss and get right inside myself."
"1535210","1537650"," And I'll have a really bad night. "
"1538670","1540310"," I'll start beating myself up."
"1544370","1546010"," Get inside my own head."
"1546290","1548090"," Oftentimes I won't trade. "
"1548530","1549210"," I'll stop trading."
"1551150","1556910"," I used to over trade or I would over trade or I would revenge trade."
"1557450","1558630"," I've done that before as well. "
"1559470","1564270"," What's fascinating is I got done yesterday with trading."
"1565210","1566270"," I had a bad day."
"1567950","1571230"," And I had meant to get some bikes. "
"1574390","1577930"," Tuned up and I didn't have the time."
"1578510","1581270"," I didn't procrastinate, but I forgot."
"1583670","1588070"," And then I was too busy when I did remember to bring him down. "
"1588330","1589310"," I'd be like, Oh, I got to do this."
"1589450","1590750"," I don't have the time to do this today."
"1590750","1593350"," I had it in my calendar. "
"1593630","1594110"," It didn't matter."
"1595110","1597050"," And I just didn't get done."
"1597610","1598990"," A month I had stopped out now. "
"1599150","1601170"," They're reprising all these options for an up move."
"1601910","1603310"," I'm going to remove my stops here."
"1619000","1620780"," So I didn't get my bikes. "
"1622140","1624960"," I never got my bikes tuned up."
"1625840","1627340"," I'm going to have to hand do this bullshit."
"1628560","1632300"," So I didn't get my fucking bikes done all spring. "
"1632300","1634360"," And I've got a bunch of bikes."
"1634380","1637440"," I've got mountain bikes, city bikes, like commuter bikes."
"1638360","1640000"," My daughter's got her own bikes. "
"1640040","1640760"," And then my kids."
"1641080","1644760"," And I've got four for each one, like wife, kids."
"1647360","1648940"," So it's a big project. "
"1649240","1651020"," You have to like, I have to like bring them down there."
"1651380","1651920"," Get it all done."
"1652320","1653820"," It's just too much work for myself. "
"1655220","1659160"," So and my kids, man, they don't know about."
"1659160","1661580"," They kind of know how to fix their bikes."
"1661720","1662480"," And I was a kid, right?"
"1662680","1663540"," You'd fix your own bike. "
"1664080","1665840"," When I was a kid, you'd like build a bike."
"1667140","1669560"," And kids really aren't like that right now."
"1670360","1673320"," They don't, they like, I don't, maybe, maybe young boys are. "
"1673460","1675220"," My daughters are like, the bike works."
"1675500","1676320"," The bike doesn't work."
"1676880","1677900"," The bike doesn't work. "
"1678080","1679420"," I'll just, I'll just ride it."
"1679940","1681700"," Whatever does work on it, we'll use."
"1685500","1688140"," And so, so I'm like, you know what?"
"1688140","1693020"," I was like, I'm too late to get these things worked on because I need them for the fourth. "
"1693900","1696200"," We're going over to this island where you can bring a bike."
"1698080","1699500"," I'm like, we'll just do the bikes."
"1700380","1703400"," And of course, I rode bikes for years. "
"1703960","1706780"," So I know how to do this stuff."
"1707100","1709060"," Or at least have a faint idea of how to do this stuff."
"1709180","1714720"," And when I was a kid, my cousins and I and my friends would build bikes. "
"1714720","1718340"," When I was a kid, we'd like find bikes, old bikes, new bikes."
"1718600","1721460"," We'd piece them together and we'd build our bikes."
"1721760","1724420"," And then when I was an adult, I was a mountain biker. "
"1724640","1728940"," So you kind of like, you really rough your bike up."
"1729120","1730460"," You take care of it at the same time."
"1730580","1731580"," You're always wiping it down. "
"1731820","1735160"," You're always improving it with small parts as you become an adult."
"1737340","1743000"," And so when I got off stream yesterday, as all this came up, like, hey, we need these bikes done"
"1743000","1743920"," and they're not done."
"1744260","1747060"," And this one's brake handle is broken. "
"1747420","1749080"," This one's fender."
"1749500","1751600"," One dollar's fender is missing a bolt."
"1753600","1755340"," And then we had some new tires. "
"1756000","1761860"," We wanted to switch our, we wanted to take our city bikes and convert them to gravel bikes."
"1762540","1764040"," So like a hybrid bike."
"1765340","1768400"," So we've got the mountain bikes and then we've got the city bike. "
"1768400","1771240"," That's light, but we want it to go on dirt paths."
"1774560","1775960"," Matt, I'm flat right now."
"1776180","1776700"," Close the flat. "
"1776980","1777480"," Trying to stop."
"1777660","1778980"," I'm going to try to stop me out here."
"1782960","1783960"," Down a penny right now. "
"1784100","1785100"," Two pennies them down right now."
"1787640","1790860"," So I'm doing this gravel bike conversion yesterday."
"1791260","1793680"," So I got to get done with work with you guys. "
"1795560","1795960"," Work."
"1797600","1799360"," And so I'm getting done with work here."
"1799400","1802060"," It's starting to roll over now on the spoos. "
"1804260","1806520"," And so we get done with work yesterday."
"1807900","1810160"," And immediately I'm like, I got to take care of these bikes."
"1811460","1813180"," So I go to my wife and my children. "
"1813380","1814300"," I'm like, I need help."
"1814500","1815900"," I'm like, I can't do all this for myself."
"1816120","1817720"," And it'll be great for the kids to learn. "
"1819840","1825580"," So I spent yesterday afternoon converting these three bikes."
"1825580","1827320"," I converted three bikes to gravel bikes."
"1829580","1833120"," I converted three bikes to, dude, I'm going to add this fucking position again. "
"1836100","1838100"," I'm all about buying fucking dips down here."
"1848210","1853490"," So I went up going down and fucking doing these bikes yesterday afternoon after the market had"
"1853490","1853770"," closed."
"1854410","1860530"," And by doing that work with my kids, first off, they got to learn how to do a bunch of"
"1860530","1862370"," stuff they wouldn't normally do, like remove tires. "
"1863130","1865710"," Not just like, hey, here's some green slime for your tire."
"1866050","1867710"," Here's some green slime."
"1867710","1869110"," It's like, let's remove some tires. "
"1869130","1870070"," Let's change them out."
"1870650","1872710"," Now, let's take a look at the inside of the rims."
"1873690","1875790"," We put some puncture plastic stuff in. "
"1876710","1883530"," And put your tires in the bikes, worked on their brake systems, calibrated the cassettes for,"
"1883890","1888070"," calibrated the cassettes for their gears."
"1888070","1897870"," And then also, let's see a look right here, calibrated the"
"1897870","1898810"," cassettes for their gears."
"1899230","1907970"," And then also, here's the pre-market low right here, 431-69, or 59 right here, calibrated some of"
"1907970","1911850"," their gears, like one through five on these city bikes. "
"1912710","1914530"," One daughter can only get on a fourth gear."
"1916930","1919030"," And so we're doing all that work yesterday."
"1919510","1921010"," Never thought about the market at any point. "
"1921030","1922330"," It was the key point here."
"1922490","1923650"," Stop thinking about the market."
"1924190","1925290"," It wasn't in my brain. "
"1926210","1927830"," I was able to spend time with kids."
"1929070","1930210"," And didn't even think about it."
"1930410","1932410"," As a matter of fact, we got done with those bikes. "
"1932570","1933990"," It was raining outside earlier."
"1934830","1938110"," And I had them start riding the bikes around the neighborhood to check them."
"1938790","1941370"," And my buddy was like, hey man, ride down to our house. "
"1941470","1943430"," So we went down and he had a barbecue."
"1944090","1948210"," We rode through the neighborhood last night and hung out at his house last night."
"1948210","1950510"," And I didn't think about the market once. "
"1952010","1954330"," And so it's like a fascinating thing."
"1954470","1959390"," If you have a bad day in the market, sometimes you just get the fuck away from the computer, you"
"1959390","1963830"," know, and out of your own head from bad decisions or poor decisions that you end up making."
"1965230","1966430"," So that was fascinating. "
"1967030","1970370"," So we end up staying out last night until pretty late."
"1970650","1971390"," I mean, we didn't get home."
"1971390","1975510"," We didn't ride home last night until 11 o'clock at night or something. "
"1976130","1979890"," So we rode back last night and not a thought on the market."
"1980690","1981810"," And I was worn out."
"1981990","1986270"," We went to sleep and woke up this morning without a thought in my brain this morning. "
"1986790","1994490"," So just for management of your emotions or your thoughts and all that kind of stuff, it was really"
"1994490","1994690"," good."
"1994890","1996690"," I was really happy with myself this morning."
"2005360","2012180"," Swaps referencing Fed meetings are unchanged for July with approximately 21 BP of hike premium"
"2012180","2015620"," priced in unchanged on the day after data. "
"2016140","2018600"," No, US new home sales report."
"2019740","2023200"," New houses sold 763,000."
"2023640","2027180"," New houses for sale, 428,000. "
"2027940","2033500"," Median sales price was 416,300."
"2034360","2034980"," Monster."
"2036760","2038120"," Monster move up there. "
"2038860","2043200"," So we have a nice swing here on May 20 second to the upside."
"2044780","2047040"," Things are looking good for the housing market."
"2048760","2058500"," And you know what else is fascinating too is I spent some time on spent some time looking at houses"
"2058500","2063520"," yesterday or the day before and Sunday was looking at houses with my wife. "
"2063540","2066060"," We're talking about going back to school with our kids."
"2067440","2070940"," And on Sunday night, I went looking to buy some houses."
"2071739","2074080"," I was looking in Montana. "
"2076500","2078420"," Our Nevada and Reno."
"2079100","2084080"," I was looking in Destin to see what the price of homes were."
"2085900","2089260"," And Destin, Florida was looking in pre COVID. "
"2089260","2093000"," I'm shocked at the price of homes now in Destin."
"2095860","2099580"," I wasn't looking in Reno or I was looking in South Reno pre COVID."
"2099780","2101640"," Then I started looking in Sparks, Nevada. "
"2103120","2104900"," And I went back and checked on Sunday."
"2106360","2110620"," And another fascinating thing was an Oak to Montana as well."
"2110740","2112080"," We have a family ranch in Montana. "
"2113260","2116320"," So I was like, yeah, I was like, if they want to go back to school and if we don't"
"2116320","2122380"," do the private school thing in Michigan, maybe they could move them to a district where it's got a"
"2122380","2123140"," great school district."
"2124340","2125960"," And they can finish their school up there, right?"
"2127800","2130480"," We'll Airbnb this house out."
"2130780","2135520"," So we'll have more Airbnb's and we'll move somewhere else where we can go sailing or hiking and"
"2135520","2135680"," biking. "
"2136700","2137840"," So I look on Sunday."
"2138140","2141720"," I'm talking to my wife and I couldn't find anything available."
"2141840","2142740"," There wasn't a ton available. "
"2144120","2146820"," Or what was available was way overpriced."
"2147760","2149360"," I should say both of those things."
"2150860","2154980"," What was available was not worth what I thought the price of those homes were. "
"2156560","2158560"," So I was like, I'm not really on this."
"2160040","2167240"," And earlier in the morning, I was coming back from a trip that I took and my mother-in-law"
"2167240","2171440"," said to me offhandedly it said to me, why don't you?"
"2172580","2179140"," She goes, if you'd like, she goes, you could send the kids or you could send your oldest to stay"
"2179140","2180700"," with me to finish up high school."
"2181580","2186600"," If she really wants to go to in-person school, you could always do something like that with her. "
"2187180","2192740"," Now mind you, this might sound crazy to you, but in our family, we both come from military"
"2192740","2195900"," backgrounds with families that live around the world."
"2195900","2197320"," We move often in our family."
"2197580","2198140"," We have no roots. "
"2199220","2201960"," We work for the, not just the military, but the government."
"2202900","2210600"," So if you know anything about government work, not like the bureaucracy stuff, but defending our"
"2210600","2215580"," nation, a lot of our family members are put on assignments around the world."
"2216160","2217980"," So we have no roots anywhere. "
"2218840","2222840"," So that kind of a statement isn't like off the wall to us."
"2223340","2224560"," Look at that sound, that makes sense."
"2226080","2231860"," So at any rate, she made that comment to me and I'm like, yeah, I was like, that's possible. "
"2232240","2235760"," So I'm like, let me go look at some houses out west though, see what I can find, or maybe"
"2235760","2237300"," we do move or something like that."
"2239320","2245660"," And so I'm looking, and what I found fascinating Sunday night was, I was like, you know what, I'll"
"2245660","2246660"," look at some rental homes."
"2248060","2249640"," I was like, let's look at some rental homes. "
"2249760","2253280"," So I get out in Zillow, and I'm looking at rental homes."
"2254700","2257520"," Out in the west and down south."
"2259100","2266220"," And I was shocked at the number of rental homes that were like part of a company. "
"2267620","2272140"," So I'm looking through right and I'm like, I'm doing the like the tabs and stuff, and my wife and"
"2272140","2273920"," I are lying in bed and I'm showing them to her."
"2274500","2277280"," And I hadn't read some of the descriptions on these homes."
"2278340","2280160"," And as we went, started to go through them. "
"2285300","2291100"," All these homes were on Zillow, at least, were all part of large national companies."
"2291560","2293100"," This dream is sponsored by."
"2293100","2294840"," They were like, we've got homes in this state. "
"2294920","2296120"," We've got homes in this state."
"2296420","2298040"," We've got homes in this state."
"2298100","2307640"," So I'm fascinated by when I first started flipping houses, it was like, you might have 10, and you"
"2307640","2311420"," flip some and you might want to, you like you're the most of the guys I knew were like, yeah,"
"2311560","2312060"," well, let's help. "
"2312560","2313880"," If I can get to 10, I'll be happy."
"2314460","2315640"," Some guys are like, I want 30."
"2316200","2317800"," And some guys are like, I want 100. "
"2318700","2321560"," But so if you got that many homes, that's a lot, right?"
"2321980","2329860"," But these companies were a consolidation of multiple investors."
"2330960","2336560"," What I found fascinating was if I held five homes and you hold 10 homes and some other guy has"
"2336560","2341920"," 30, they're now like consolidating into an investor group."
"2342360","2345020"," They also had like, Hey, if you want to sell your house, you can. "
"2345440","2349980"," If you own houses, you can join us to have them managed together in this large property management"
"2349980","2350580"," company."
"2350960","2355080"," And so I'm reading through the description that I would go to these guys websites and see what"
"2355080","2356100"," they're actually offering."
"2357100","2358760"," And I just found it fascinating. "
"2358920","2359900"," I've never seen that before."
"2361440","2363920"," Quite like that, nor the prevalence of it."
"2367220","2368220"," Yeah, they're everywhere. "
"2368580","2369280"," It was wild."
"2369540","2372040"," And this was like, this wasn't like one property."
"2372820","2375020"," This was like homes everywhere. "
"2376900","2383060"," Consolidation and some kind of a management company for home investors too."
"2383280","2386520"," Like if you're an investor, you just like sign up for these companies."
"2388360","2391160"," Now, I don't know if I get mail from these companies or not. "
"2391540","2392940"," I don't know."
"2392940","2396960"," We have like a business, business mailing addresses and stuff and I don't get a lot of that mail."
"2397640","2399620"," We've got like a screened for us. "
"2399760","2401380"," So I don't see some of that stuff, maybe."
"2402580","2405560"," But I didn't know it was as like was glaring."
"2405580","2410200"," It was like 60% of the homes we looked at were under some kind of management. "
"2412180","2413700"," I even went on Craigslist."
"2414860","2421060"," So I went to Zillow and then I went to realtor.com and then I went to Facebook and Craigslist"
"2421060","2422500"," to see if they were pervasive."
"2424140","2425860"," Craigslist was a no-go. "
"2426260","2427920"," It looked like a bunch of scam posts."
"2428860","2430560"," Realtor.com was overrun."
"2430740","2431600"," Zillow was overrun. "
"2432120","2438240"," Facebook Marketplace was a real challenge to look at anything for sale or for sale was easy."
"2438920","2440360"," For rent was even more difficult."
"2454730","2456670"," We added some more calls down here. "
"2456890","2457890"," Just building a position."
"2463100","2465080"," So I just thought I was fascinating."
"2465080","2468620"," It seems like, I mean, I thought it was close. "
"2470040","2471360"," I thought it was close."
"2472180","2473360"," Well, or not close."
"2473740","2480740"," I figured that, I figured that the, like you'll never own a home and you'll rent for the rest of"
"2480740","2481680"," your life and you'll like it. "
"2482940","2485080"," Would come over time, maybe."
"2486220","2487460"," And it wouldn't be for everybody."
"2487780","2494580"," I figured there'd be a decent amount of the, or a decent portion of the population that would, uh,"
"2495480","2499800"," generationally own homes and pass them down to their kids or sell them to get the money to buy"
"2499800","2500220"," another home. "
"2500540","2503580"," Like there'd be a class of people that can be a homeowner in the US."
"2505500","2510220"," Uh, a decent, a decent enough size of a homeowner that could be a homeowner in the US."
"2511140","2513980"," Uh, whether you agree with that or not. "
"2517300","2519180"," But it doesn't even look like that."
"2524300","2528360"," It doesn't even look like that from what I looked at on Sunday and then seeing this report this"
"2528360","2528640"," morning."
"2529540","2531540"," Uh, and we talked about this yesterday too, right?"
"2531700","2534040"," I said to you, yeah, we're going to get some home sales numbers coming out. "
"2534060","2534920"," They're probably going to be pretty good."
"2535360","2539640"," Seeing those numbers this morning, uh, scares me too because."
"2541220","2546100"," If I own all the homes and you own all the homes and these other people are trying to get"
"2546100","2546620"," into homes. "
"2547700","2550780"," And we're not selling because we're renting them out to people."
"2551840","2554020"," Uh, there's no homes available to you, right?"
"2554200","2554480"," To buy."
"2555900","2559540"," And if I am going to sell one, I'm going to put a premium on it because it is a"
"2559540","2559820"," rental. "
"2561580","2566980"," Um, and I thought I knew it was there, but I didn't know how prevalent it was."
"2567900","2570860"," Until I went and looked for some rental homes."
"2572460","2573500"," I haven't looked for rental. "
"2573760","2574400"," I don't look for rentals."
"2575560","2578840"," I don't know what a rental home, what the rental home market is."
"2579760","2585180"," My last time I rented a home, uh, you know, like some guy owned it like you. "
"2585440","2587100"," Or you can go to a company, I guess, for a condo."
"2587100","2591840"," But if you're really a rental house, normally it's like some guy named Bob or something."
"2592680","2593540"," You know what he's like?"
"2594280","2596720"," I'll run a background check on you and what do you got?"
"2596800","2597700"," You got a wife, you got a kid. "
"2598260","2600600"," Uh, I live down the street."
"2601000","2603260"," That's, that's the kind of homeowner that I am, right?"
"2603260","2608640"," Uh, so I was just fascinated by, you should do this on your own."
"2608840","2609740"," Go to like Zillow. "
"2611340","2612620"," Nothing you have to rent a home."
"2612800","2615460"," Just go to Zillow and go to like some, um, somewhere anywhere in the US."
"2616200","2620740"," And find like 10 properties that you think you're like, I could live in this house. "
"2621540","2623720"," Click on them all and then read the descriptions."
"2624900","2625960"," Because it starts out normal."
"2626560","2628220"," And I gotta, I gotta pull one of these up. "
"2628840","2630400"," Because one of these were fascinating."
"2631000","2632620"," How they, how the company was."
"2632760","2634300"," I'm going to, I'm going to pull one of these up for you today. "
"2634940","2638520"," I'm going to go through my history and pull one of these fucking things up because it was bizarre."
"2640000","2644260"," Uh, it was bizarre to read some of the rules, how they crafted some."
"2644580","2644980"," I'm a homeowner. "
"2645300","2650440"," I rent out, uh, I've better, I've been a landlord and I also do Airbnb's."
"2650560","2655040"," So I kind of know the ins and outs of what you can and can't say to tenants."
"2655820","2658180"," And some of the shit they write in these things. "
"2658180","2661500"," I'm like, yeah, you can get away with that if you write that."
"2661640","2664680"," If they agree to this, you can get away with that in a court."
"2665140","2666700"," But only if they agree to it. "
"2667280","2668420"," And it was fascinating."
"2669040","2672060"," Like they were like offering tenants to sign up."
"2673080","2674760"," Uh, it was, it was really fascinating. "
"2675260","2677380"," Like a lot of property men, if you, if you want a property."
"2679180","2681860"," There's a lot of bullshit property maintenance you have to do."
"2682160","2684040"," Not bullshit, but you have to do it. "
"2684860","2690820"," And if you're an absentee owner, uh, if you're an absentee owner, it can be costly."
"2691160","2696280"," So I, I live where I own my properties, but let's say you lived in California and you had a"
"2696280","2702460"," rental property in Boston, let's say you want a house in Boston, you rent it out and you have a"
"2702460","2703580"," property management company."
"2705040","2707300"," Those property management companies are brutal. "
"2707380","2712580"," They'll be like, uh, yeah, we'll do your, your, your winter maintenance for, for you on your"
"2712580","2712900"," rental."
"2712900","2719640"," And they'll charge you like $300 to drive over to your rental property and pop in an air filter in"
"2719640","2720020"," your furnace."
"2721260","2721360"," Right. "
"2721920","2726280"," They'll turn off your what this is, this winterization of rental property is."
"2726700","2729400"," They go to your house, they change the air filter."
"2730160","2735720"," And they turn off the water spigots from inside the house and open the outside spigot. "
"2735820","2736580"," So it drains out."
"2736920","2741440"," So they turn the water off on the, on the lines in the home and they change an air filter."
"2741920","2744240"," Both of those things, like 300 bucks minimum. "
"2745260","2750100"," And that's a lot of money to it to an investor, real estate investor and all those little things"
"2750100","2751600"," that up over the course of a year."
"2753200","2756640"," They're very costly, like property management companies are two things."
"2757440","2761200"," Uh, there's some good ones out there, but most of them don't want to talk to you unless you own"
"2761200","2762020"," a hundred properties. "
"2762360","2763600"," Like this is what I want to talk to you like."
"2763840","2764720"," How many houses you got?"
"2765160","2766340"," You get five, get fucked."
"2766920","2767400"," You got a hundred?"
"2767660","2768360"," Let's talk, right?"
"2768360","2771740"," And then the second part that they do is they grind you on stuff. "
"2772240","2776680"," They grind you on shit, then they'll be like, hey, it was nice to be like, uh, I want you"
"2776680","2780120"," to do the maintenance or the, um, management, but I don't want you to do the construction."
"2781080","2785540"," So if something goes wrong, a lot of times property managers will be like, yeah, I'll get the roof"
"2785540","2786180"," done for you."
"2786360","2788740"," And it'll be cheaper, right?"
"2788920","2792380"," But they're taking a cut out of that, that money and you don't know if the work is good. "
"2792860","2793400"," Blah, blah, blah."
"2793680","2795000"," And they hit you all the time."
"2795680","2800260"," So the time you're done, you might make like 20, 30% if you're lucky. "
"2801180","2802620"," So they know what you bought it for."
"2802760","2803700"," They know what your mortgage is."
"2803840","2804840"," They know what your rent is. "
"2805180","2811280"," They know what the, um, uh, how you, they want to make sure that you make 20, 30%, if possible."
"2811680","2814260"," But if something comes out of the blue, fuck you as the owner."
"2815520","2815880"," Right?"
"2816020","2819220"," If you have a bad tenant or something, they're not going to help you there, right?"
"2819560","2823320"," So now you're, you're not making your 20% on your real estate investment. "
"2824080","2828960"," Uh, so priority management companies, uh, if you're an investor, they, they kind of pissed you off."
"2829420","2830680"," Uh, they can be really good."
"2830720","2831900"," They can really piss you off. "
"2833280","2833560"," Yeah."
"2834440","2838120"," Uh, so it was fascinating on one of these websites I was reading their website."
"2838120","2842720"," And basically they're trying to get tenants to sign up. "
"2843940","2845740"," To do the work."
"2846760","2849140"," That the landlord normally pays for it."
"2849800","2854080"," So the shit that I have to absorb as your, or as your landlord. "
"2854980","2857240"," Like I have to pay the 300 bucks to have your."
"2857860","2863600"," Fil, your furnace filter replaced in your water, uh, your exterior water shut off."
"2863720","2864260"," I shit you not. "
"2867760","2869860"," They're asking perspective tenants."
"2870640","2873740"," If they want to sign up to have that done."
"2874360","2879000"," So what they'll tell the tenant is, uh, you're ultimately responsible for. "
"2879000","2884840"," Your, your, your furnace filter and turning your water off in the house, which you are not as a"
"2884840","2885000"," tenant."
"2885040","2887000"," I want you to know that you're not responsible for that."
"2887860","2892280"," Uh, but they say that you are, they can say that they can just say it like it. "
"2892320","2893060"," It's on their website."
"2893380","2897920"," They're like, this, these people have houses all over the nation, like all over the fucking"
"2897920","2898320"," country."
"2898640","2901880"," And they're like, what if you'd like, you can sign up for the service to have it done. "
"2902440","2905900"," It's going to cost you $150 every year to have it done."
"2906160","2907940"," And I'm assuming people are doing this."
"2908440","2914040"," Uh, these tenants are like blind to the fact that, uh, maybe they can tell you like you have to"
"2914040","2917160"," take care of your lawn and stuff like that, but they're offering you. "
"2917520","2920080"," Uh, this one company was like, I see you not."
"2920180","2926200"," This one company is like, uh, your tenant is responsible for the yard for the, for the mowing of"
"2926200","2926460"," the yard."
"2927840","2928740"," Like you can do that. "
"2928860","2929140"," That's fine."
"2930120","2935140"," They go, uh, if you don't take care of it, uh, within the first month or something."
"2936380","2940440"," You have to sign an agreement that, uh, I will take care of it for you with a company. "
"2941000","2945340"," The price for that lawn service was out of control, or I thought it was out of control."
"2946000","2947380"," He's taken a cut off of it."
"2947800","2951840"," Uh, but then some of the other ones that they had on there were ones that you don't have to"
"2951840","2952020"," do. "
"2952200","2953600"," They just offered them to you."
"2953960","2955440"," Like, would you like this done every year?"
"2955560","2956440"," Would you like your gutters cleaned?"
"2956640","2961540"," Would you like your, um, the bushes cleaned and you can sign up for the service through us?"
"2961540","2967880"," So this is like really slimy way of, uh, trying to get, uh, a tenant to pay for the maintenance"
"2967880","2970760"," that, uh, a landlord typically absorbs."
"2973900","2976940"," I'm just bouncing around right now on these fucking calls. "
"2983750","2985150"," So that was pretty wild."
"2991850","2995170"," They're saying that they're reporting the rent to the credit reporting agency."
"2995170","2999190"," So when you leave, they can hit the renter with any charges they deem. "
"2999490","3000990"," And if they don't, they'll nail their credit."
"3001550","3002070"," Geez."
"3005190","3010290"," I didn't know this was all going on and probably the most glaring thing of all of it. "
"3010770","3015770"," Was the consolidation of the rental market or that industry."
"3016970","3021410"," Um, and you know, it's the fact that I even considered it like the fact that."
"3022570","3029210"," No, the fact that I looked at homes to buy and said, that fucking house isn't worth fucking 600"
"3029210","3029770"," grand. "
"3030530","3034110"," I was like, if I'm going to buy a six hundred thousand dollar house, it's not going to be there."
"3039310","3041590"," It was like way overpriced."
"3042670","3044750"," I was like, you're out of your fucking mind. "
"3046370","3046850"," So."
"3050110","3052170"," So I'm like, well, I'll look for some rental homes."
"3052490","3056070"," And so I was expecting some guy named Bob to have a rental home. "
"3056290","3056710"," Fuck no."
"3057130","3059610"," His tenants probably are never leaving."
"3060510","3064110"," It was some company and it wasn't like a real company. "
"3064310","3065830"," It wasn't like Black Rock or anything."
"3066050","3068850"," It was like some like cobbled together."
"3069810","3070690"," Investors scam. "
"3071310","3073390"," You can kind of tell these companies are too."
"3073550","3076190"," They're like, um, they're kind of grifty."
"3079270","3081270"," Like have that air of a grift. "
"3081410","3085490"," Like, you know how like you get the, like a get rich quick scheme or something?"
"3086130","3087390"," It's like a, what's the guy?"
"3087590","3088250"," That's like a Tony."
"3088570","3091850"," What's that guy's name from the, from like the 2000s or something?"
"3092350","3093830"," It's like a Tony Robbins thing."
"3093970","3095250"," You're like, yeah, that's kind of grifty. "
"3096270","3101450"," You're like, like it's not quite legit, but it's not quite not legit."
"3103490","3104890"," It doesn't seem corporate."
"3104890","3108090"," It's like, it's like we tried to make a corporate, but it's not. "
"3110490","3112550"," We didn't really hire a branding company."
"3115310","3119190"," We kind of just had like a bunch of, bunch of bros with a real estate license."
"3119390","3121450"," We came together in a room and we're like, fuck yeah. "
"3130570","3135050"," I gotta, I gotta find one of these companies for you guys because it was a disaster."
"3135450","3136370"," I'm like reading this stuff."
"3136550","3137610"," I'm like, I wouldn't fucking trust. "
"3137610","3138970"," I gotta find out."
"3139070","3140750"," I was like, I gotta find out who these guys are."
"3141510","3144310"," Like, like, Remax kind of doesn't look like a scam. "
"3145170","3147690"," Like, Remax was kind of famous for this shit, right?"
"3149330","3154470"," Like, Remax had like, it was kind of like, what was that stuff called?"
"3156630","3159490"," Some of this pyramid schemes, famous pyramid schemes."
"3164570","3168170"," Amway, like, Amway, like, they're like, they look like an Amway."
"3168170","3169090"," You know it's a pyramid. "
"3170150","3174190"," Well, like, Remax is kind of like that too, but it's more legit feeling."
"3178190","3181290"," I shouldn't call, I shouldn't say Remax is a fucking pyramid scheme."
"3182410","3188450"," You know, it's gonna, it's like, yeah, I can eat the, I'll take a bowl of the Remax over there. "
"3189210","3190210"," Do you want some Amway?"
"3190470","3191130"," Fuck no, dude."
"3191310","3192610"," I already, I can tell that's a scam."
"3193930","3196130"," I don't want the, I don't want the Amway scam. "
"3196130","3198430"," I'll just take the bowl that I can digest over there."
"3201690","3202450"," Herbalife, yeah."
"3202810","3204430"," I actually remember Herbalife too. "
"3204710","3211270"," I went to UCLA and I was in the army and I was like, lived in different places to get"
"3211270","3211630"," my degree."
"3214630","3218470"," Herbalife was being pimped out all over campus while I was there as a kid."
"3221290","3222590"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"3223250","3224390"," Print it for daddy."
"3225090","3227910"," Just building a position here and two fucking days."
"3227910","3229430"," Print it out for me, please. "
"3232270","3234710"," Seriously, re-priced all these options."
"3235030","3237130"," I had to buy some of 23 cents down here."
"3237770","3238670"," I'm like, come on, man. "
"3238970","3239710"," Fucking print it."
"3241650","3243250"," I ain't fucking selling, man."
"3244530","3246910"," I'm staying in this fucking trade until they print. "
"3248970","3251430"," I want like a fucking 3000% banger."
"3258830","3259870"," I'll bring these up."
"3259930","3262310"," I'll find them today and show you some of these fucking companies. "
"3262530","3263550"," They're fucking grifters."
"3263950","3265350"," They're straight up."
"3266170","3270410"," It's like, you can tell that like, my assumption here, right?"
"3271150","3272670"," Because I've gone to these things. "
"3273110","3274170"," So I'm an investor, right?"
"3274850","3279010"," Like you get roped into the wrong group of people and they're like, yeah, we have coffee every"
"3279010","3279310"," Sunday."
"3279430","3280530"," You should show up."
"3281230","3282310"," Those are kind of cool. "
"3282990","3283910"," Like you show up to a group."
"3284210","3286030"," There's like 20, 30 people there."
"3286650","3288270"," And you meet some cool people. "
"3288390","3289030"," They help you out."
"3289210","3289850"," You help them out."
"3289990","3290950"," You pass along names. "
"3292530","3293750"," All kinds of different names."
"3294010","3302050"," Like good property managers, bad property managers, construction guys, wholesale market stuff."
"3302590","3304010"," People trying to get out of the market. "
"3304870","3306370"," Rumor mill, that kind of stuff."
"3308010","3310190"," Judges, conversations about judges, that kind of stuff."
"3310810","3312790"," But you're like, those are pretty good groups. "
"3312790","3316170"," But then there's like someone's like a grifter."
"3316330","3317690"," There's always like a salesman."
"3318050","3323830"," The salesman's always like, you know, like eventually it turns into, hey, you guys got to come to"
"3323830","3328690"," this, come out to this thing we're hosting at the hotel. "
"3329510","3333690"," It's like you go to the hotel and it's like slimy salespeople."
"3335750","3336510"," Oh, God."
"3338530","3340390"," And they want to do a consortium, right?"
"3340630","3341250"," They don't own anything. "
"3341750","3344090"," They want to manage your holdings for you."
"3346210","3348150"," And the Crater, like a mega corp."
"3351290","3354690"," It's not like Blackstone, Blackstone, or Blackrock, excuse me. "
"3354810","3356410"," It's like a million properties."
"3356910","3358530"," It's like a riff-raff consortium."
"3359670","3363510"," And it's just another way for some grifter to take more money out of your pocket that you're"
"3363510","3366130"," already paying out to property management companies and all this kind of stuff. "
"3367430","3368310"," So I don't know."
"3368310","3372730"," I'm just going to tear on this stuff right now after seeing those housing numbers."
"3385560","3387280"," Finance Margaritaville machines, exactly. "
"3390020","3391100"," Yeah, it's just like that."
"3391180","3393600"," That's what it turns into is like a timeshare pitch event."
"3395220","3396260"," I can't do times. "
"3396420","3397080"," I can't do that."
"3397180","3397360"," Should I?"
"3397460","3398560"," I've got friends that have done that."
"3398880","3399420"," Family members too. "
"3400000","3401660"," We've got the free trip to Colorado."
"3402340","3403320"," We've got the free trip to Utah."
"3403620","3404640"," We've got the free trip to Florida. "
"3404640","3407860"," We suffered through the timeshare sales meeting."
"3409300","3410300"," Come on, baby."
"3411780","3412640"," Print my day. "
"3412960","3414080"," Print my whole fucking week."
"3416020","3418380"," I want like at least 70 cents."
"3419420","3420860"," I want like 300%. "
"3420860","3425240"," I want to make like a cool fucking 10 or 15 K something like that 20 K."
"3426600","3427820"," Print it up for daddy."
"3428660","3430100"," Make me green this week."
"3440530","3442230"," I think it's beyond that now, Winky. "
"3442970","3444030"," I think it really is, man."
"3444170","3447610"," I think maybe I didn't say enough of on that subject."
"3447950","3453730"," I think that we're not like I was like, yeah, at some point we're going to be like Europe where"
"3453730","3458470"," everyone's going to be a renter, but they'll always be like, you know, 60, 70% of people that own"
"3458470","3458850"," homes. "
"3459390","3466710"," Dude, they are fucking ramping into you, not even if you sell your house that you're either going"
"3466710","3468270"," to pay way over pay for it."
"3469730","3471590"," Or you're going to be a renter."
"3471950","3477590"," Like I think we're I think it's I think that shift is more rapid than I thought it was. "
"3477770","3479830"," I think I was like, yeah, maybe the next 20 years."
"3481410","3484210"," I think they're I think they're fucking moving on it right now."
"3484210","3485570"," Like viciously. "
"3489230","3493930"," Like there's a consolidation moment happening right now quietly in the background."
"3496910","3502170"," Where if you do buy, so like if I sold everything I had here in Detroit and went and bought"
"3502170","3508350"," something, it's going to be fucking even with cash, it's going to be I'm going to pay a huge"
"3508350","3509410"," premium for it."
"3509650","3510550"," I'll never get that. "
"3510650","3511530"," I don't think I'll ever get that."
"3511630","3512610"," Maybe I'll get it back, but."
"3514990","3515990"," I don't know. "
"3516350","3518270"," I'm really it's it's this bizarre thing."
"3518430","3524330"," I don't know that my kids or maybe they can, but whatever my kids end up buying."
"3524330","3526830"," No fucking way. "
"3527010","3528270"," Is it going to be worth whatever they pay?"
"3531210","3533590"," Yeah, when I was over 2019, then COVID happened."
"3533710","3534790"," They basically bought everything and so."
"3535310","3541150"," Yeah, I thought I figured it would take 20 years, but I think we might be closer than we think. "
"3544750","3549830"," To the end of the end of homeownership for people."
"3550430","3551630"," I think it's a real thing."
"3551630","3556090"," I thought it was like an existential threat to the housing market. "
"3557130","3559790"," We might there might be a way around it or something, but."
"3560170","3566030"," I mean, dude, no one wants to sell either."
"3566230","3569490"," Like if you if you if you have too much of an investor class. "
"3571210","3574950"," So if everyone's an investor, you'll never sell."
"3575190","3575810"," I'm not selling."
"3577910","3579590"," My wife talks about selling. "
"3581150","3583190"," We had that conversation this weekend too."
"3583970","3585990"," We actually have the conversation of divesting."
"3587210","3588450"," And she wants to divest. "
"3589670","3590450"," I don't."
"3592090","3598550"," We even we even had a conversation this weekend where she was like, let's sell this and we'll buy"
"3598550","3599330"," some stuff out west."
"3600690","3602430"," And I said no to even that. "
"3604250","3608270"," I had said to her that I was like, well, if we go sell around the world, if we travel"
"3608270","3611430"," a lot, I have no problem coming back to Michigan."
"3612150","3612990"," I was like a home base."
"3614110","3615010"," You have keep will be cheaper. "
"3615010","3616210"," The taxes will be cheaper."
"3618450","3622990"," I was like, why am I going to maintain a home in a nice place?"
"3623270","3626290"," That's a million dollar home or some shit $600,000 home."
"3626730","3629850"," Just the maintenance of being gone for that long is going to be out of control. "
"3630370","3631470"," Taxes will be out of control."
"3638490","3640850"," Yeah, you know, I think he has that I agree."
"3641130","3642390"," Or I agreed. "
"3642750","3644630"," I agreed ish with you."
"3645450","3646510"," Until I looked."
"3648590","3649490"," I agreed with you. "
"3649990","3653150"," I agreed with you before COVID."
"3653250","3654110"," I agreed with you after COVID."
"3655450","3658650"," I even to some extent agreed with you up until this past week. "
"3659490","3660990"," We have too much land."
"3661670","3662890"," We'll just do more developments."
"3663530","3664730"," Maybe we cycle back into that. "
"3664730","3673430"," I could agree with you again, but I'm just fascinated at the prevalence of buy or rent."
"3677630","3681830"," The people that are selling these homes are probably not homeowners."
"3683050","3685490"," There's probably a small percentage of homeowners. "
"3686230","3690310"," A lot of the properties that I sold for software sale were investors."
"3691050","3694630"," And a lot of the homes I saw for rent were investors."
"3696430","3703610"," So it's like, I've got a 10 pack of homes I'm going to dump their investments. "
"3704230","3710230"," So they're worth more than if I'm just a homeowner trying to sell."
"3711110","3713470"," So I'll put a large price on it."
"3714150","3716550"," Let's say a house is worth $350,000. "
"3717050","3718710"," I'll put a price tag of $650."
"3720390","3721490"," If it sells, it sells."
"3721590","3722550"," If it doesn't, it doesn't. "
"3723690","3724750"," It's an investment home."
"3724990","3725730"," I have a renter in there."
"3727870","3733710"," And then there's the whole other part of this, which is the rental market. "
"3736550","3739190"," So it's not like a, I don't know how to explain this."
"3739350","3741610"," It's not a better way to explain it."
"3743850","3750590"," As a homeowner, there was a time in the U.S. where your greatest investment was your home. "
"3753170","3758390"," So you would work a job, have a pension or have some kind of retirement plan."
"3759110","3762970"," You buy a home and you get old and you look towards that."
"3763250","3765230"," Those two things as a way to retire. "
"3767150","3770610"," And it's looking like it's not that anymore."
"3771610","3775410"," It's looking like one home's not enough for me."
"3775410","3778430"," I need to have about 10 years ago. "
"3778570","3781050"," It looked like I can only have five or 10."
"3781210","3781590"," That's plenty."
"3782170","3783790"," If they're local to me, that's fine. "
"3784570","3787390"," Now it's like I own them all over the country."
"3787750","3789250"," They're managed by a company."
"3790350","3793270"," I need to add more as many as possible. "
"3796610","3798430"," And it's like magnified."
"3799830","3802390"," And so I have no emotional attachment to these homes."
"3802390","3805390"," I have no local attachment to these homes. "
"3806110","3807470"," I just own there in a portfolio."
"3820830","3825170"," So I say, I don't know where you live, but East Coast, we're just building out like Atlanta,"
"3825370","3828330"," Charlotte, Tampa, Special Texas, and it's in places like Bay Area."
"3828990","3829670"," Really can't be. "
"3829730","3832350"," We're just moving out of there to places where they are building out."
"3833430","3836670"," Keep keeps sprawling out rural, but there's nothing there."
"3839270","3841530"," This is sponsored by to the tick. "
"3842070","3843290"," Get free daily points."
"3843790","3845470"," The banachi and market profile levels."
"3845770","3846990"," They are building out, for example. "
"3850910","3851810"," Building out."
"3851990","3853110"," Yeah, it's kind of weird too."
"3853290","3857210"," So I've got my buddy, my buddy owns properties in Atlanta. "
"3858790","3861530"," And he disagrees with you too."
"3862230","3867690"," He has like, Joe, Joe donut does some work with the real estate market in Atlanta."
"3869270","3870510"," He says it's insane. "
"3871890","3874090"," He's just, he's saying it's the same as where it is here."
"3882190","3885950"," Areas that aren't, that used to be rural, aren't a rural anymore."
"3886210","3887330"," I agree with that too, Jeremy. "
"3892880","3895400"," They're building out further out in Portland."
"3899730","3901030"," Yeah, they're building farther out."
"3901170","3903890"," I went to Park City last year. "
"3904290","3905870"," They built out there too."
"3906230","3907310"," They were, they were."
"3908270","3912170"," So when I go skiing in Park City every year, the expansion was insane. "
"3913490","3914810"," There were people in Park City."
"3914970","3918490"," They were like them from Park City, but they were an hour away from Park City."
"3918790","3919690"," I thought that was kind of weird. "
"3920030","3921010"," That was a sprawl."
"3922530","3925810"," Colorado did that two decades ago, 2000."
"3925810","3933330"," If you went to Colorado Denver specifically, it was a small dirty town still in the year 2000. "
"3934910","3940070"," But now they've expanded out with those cookie cutter communities and stuff."
"3955180","3957220"," Yeah, the builds are cutting corners."
"3957480","3957860"," I've heard that. "
"3958040","3959180"," I've heard that argument too."
"3959640","3960540"," I've seen the."
"3962400","3963520"," I've been offered. "
"3963720","3967600"," So I just finished a rehab and these guys wanted me to use."
"3968160","3970520"," Two by fours or two by threes."
"3970760","3971920"," I did just in rehab at a house. "
"3972020","3973560"," I own and they offered me."
"3974600","3977460"," Two by fours that are the piece together two by fours."
"3977740","3980800"," You guys know about that stuff and they were claiming that they're fine. "
"3981400","3983100"," And so I went and looked at some of them."
"3983560","3985280"," I went to a Menards to look at them."
"3985380","3986560"," Let me see if I can find these things. "
"3991040","3991760"," Menards construction."
"3996330","4001130"," They're like cut offs like waste scrap material that's sandwiched in glued."
"4007530","4008970"," Yeah, you've seen those Jeremy. "
"4009470","4010670"," Have you seen those man?"
"4011070","4013510"," And they're like slightly cheaper, but not really."
"4014530","4016870"," And they're using them in new house construction right now."
"4017430","4019030"," Then I'm like, what the fuck I'm like?"
"4019170","4020810"," What about when that glue comes undone?"
"4022230","4026010"," Some of the insulation materials kind of bizarre to some of the insulating stuff. "
"4026010","4027570"," They're using the wraps on houses."

"4055470","4057930"," It's kind of fascinating like figure. "
"4060070","4068330"," I think there's a use for OSB, but I think there's a good use for OSB, but like your time"
"4068330","4071550"," like OSB type products, the whole house is made out of that shit."
"4073110","4075070"," Chemicals forever chemicals that kind of stuff."
"4078510","4082050"," You know, there's a guy on YouTube. "
"4082050","4084970"," I think his name is a fine home building or something."
"4084970","4092650"," And for a lot of years, he was using cutting edge materials and techniques."
"4093630","4097130"," And recently he's come out and been like, nah, half that shit doesn't work. "
"4098450","4099350"," Like you're either."
"4099670","4101910"," If you do like over building it, it's becoming sick."
"4102029","4109710"," And then he talks about he's done some video series on some of the cheap shit that's being used in"
"4109710","4110590"," construction materials. "

"4120330","4127170"," He's like, he hasn't come full circle, but he's pulled back in a lot of what he liked. "
"4128029","4137290"," Or he was maybe looking forward to in construction materials and design our materials and some of"
"4137290","4138729"," the building choices people are making."
"4139850","4144290"," So he had a whole like like a bell curve of let's try this."
"4144490","4144930"," Let's do that. "
"4145090","4145970"," Or this is the new thing."
"4146950","4150390"," And then years later, come back and say, nah, we probably shouldn't have done this."
"4150450","4151410"," We probably shouldn't be doing that. "
"4155149","4156130"," He's got a great channel."
"4156270","4156569"," I like it."
"4157130","4159550"," I like that he's changed his views over the years too. "

"4233610","4235650"," They don't want to pay me for going up there."

"4333370","4335550"," I feel like we do this shit every month right. "
"4338210","4341290"," Like yeah they're like spies not going to go up though bro."
"4341670","4342770"," And then we just get an explode."
"4343010","4344650"," This is how we fucking squeeze man. "
"4344810","4345830"," This is how we squeeze."
"4346370","4349090"," This is how we're going to get all time highs again."
"4349190","4350730"," I don't know how I was but this run highs again. "
"4350990","4352350"," This same shit happened last time."
"4354690","4358590"," Just like trying to sell futures trying to pin the spoons."
"4360350","4362730"," And then we just get an explosive fucking run. "
"4363410","4364790"," It just doesn't stop."
"4367590","4369530"," Kind of fucking stupid to look at."
"4372650","4374070"," Like we're in a hedge spoons. "
"4374850","4377190"," And then they're like why are we going up so much?"
"4377410","4380390"," And I'm like yeah because you were doing that stupid fucking hedging for the past month."
"4389230","4390410"," Ball's deep right now baby."
"4393010","4394550"," Ball's deep long calls here. "
"4400890","4402410"," I don't know if they want to pay them though."
"4403390","4405150"," I can already see they don't want to pay them."
"4408860","4411780"," Usually they'll start paying them but they haven't paid them yet. "
"4413340","4416220"," They're probably thinking like how do we get there and not pay this shit."
"4417000","4419460"," Because I want like I want three four five hundred percent."
"4420600","4421720"," I better fucking get it. "
"4422940","4425220"," So I'll wait around all day long for it to happen."
"4434350","4442050"," Yeah I've seen the sprawl like so in Denver Denver was a small town and then they sprawled out"
"4442050","4442430"," Denver."
"4442730","4444390"," They did the same thing with CS. "
"4445830","4447970"," They've done the same thing in Santa Fe."
"4448590","4450730"," I've seen it in places like Austin."
"4452610","4456450"," But still you're talking about even with that sprawl. "
"4457170","4462030"," I realize that that sprawl is there but that's not the people I'm talking about."
"4462570","4468330"," I'm not talking about I'm going to build a track of homes as a developer."
"4469870","4473070"," I'm talking about homes. "
"4474070","4478390"," So if I was going to look at a home and not be in that development."
"4480270","4481790"," Personally I don't like those."
"4482590","4489730"," One time in my life I lived in a private community and we had an HOA and we had a"
"4489730","4491570"," gate and we had our own school. "
"4492030","4493550"," We had our own pool."
"4494010","4495070"," We had our own trails."
"4496570","4499550"," I was an exclusive community and I would never live in that again. "
"4499550","4503830"," I don't think maybe I would but I don't think I would in the future."
"4505950","4508290"," So outside of looking for those homes in those communities."
"4511150","4516990"," I couldn't find many homes that were that were like being built by Billy Bob on Main Street. "
"4517770","4520210"," The homes that are already built in there."
"4520950","4526010"," I didn't see that so maybe I'm wrong but I didn't see it."
"4532110","4535950"," Denver sprawl if you're from Denver. "
"4536750","4537310"," I'm from Colorado."
"4537610","4538810"," I spent many years living there."
"4539590","4541490"," If you remember Denver sprawl. "
"4542470","4544550"," Dude that sprawl was out of control."
"4545450","4547890"," I mean I'm not talking about in the city I'm coming outside the city."
"4548470","4552950"," Like driving into the city or the metropolitan area of Denver. "
"4553690","4554790"," That sprawl is insane."
"4555850","4558770"," Like those houses like all those communities along the highway."
"4559310","4564350"," They all have like the same little like plazas and small roads. "
"4564790","4567030"," It's really bizarre like every building looks the same."
"4567670","4569610"," They have like tract homes everywhere."
"4570250","4571130"," That shit's bizarre. "
"4571870","4572670"," It's kind of creepy."
"4573570","4578490"," Like every town every little town center has like a bookstore and they've got like a Starbucks and"
"4578490","4578910"," they've got."
"4579830","4582930"," They all have the same little shops and stuff all by the same companies. "
"4585090","4587090"," Oh yeah man like Arvada dude."
"4588250","4589390"," Yeah dude exactly."
"4590110","4591070"," Hold on a second here. "
"4591770","4592870"," Hold on a second here."
"4592930","4594150"," I'll tell you all these communities."
"4594610","4595350"," It's fucking bizarre. "
"4595930","4596970"," I'm front."
"4597270","4599210"," You might not know this but I'm from the West."
"4599610","4605590"," Like I mean I was born and raised in Boston where I've spent my entire adult life in the West. "
"4609230","4610190"," That's where I'm from."
"4611550","4612790"," I'm not from Michigan."
"4615010","4623520"," But like yeah like Centennial. "
"4624420","4627220"," Like 25 head and south Larkspur."
"4628460","4629400"," Palmer Lake."
"4630420","4633920"," All the way down to fucking even CS right now is kind of like that right. "
"4634200","4635020"," Oh it's kind of like Denver."
"4639290","4642070"," Like what is this place like the Meadows."
"4642510","4644090"," Do you guys know the Meadows by any chance?"
"4644850","4647590"," Like the Meadows the outlets at Castle Rock. "
"4649030","4650130"," Castle Pines."
"4653830","4654770"," Heritage Hills."
"4656490","4657350"," Lone tree. "
"4662850","4664190"," What else we got up here."
"4668590","4670770"," Fiddler's green amphitheater."
"4678570","4682250"," Like would you consider CS now like a suburb of Denver maybe. "
"4683910","4686890"," Would that now be considered like a like a suburb of it."
"4694650","4695970"," Stone Gate Parker."
"4697350","4698410"," Almost of the Pineery. "
"4716630","4718470"," Yeah the only gap is Castle Rock."
"4719230","4720210"," Probably right right."
"4734420","4736820"," Man they're like so we're grinding up right now. "
"4737060","4738120"," Like so ready."
"4739840","4743620"," I think here my calls are 43 cents down here."
"4743900","4747980"," They were right here maybe they're 41 43 41. "
"4747980","4750240"," We're trading right now a new high."
"4750720","4752720"," They're only giving me 37 cents."
"4753480","4754800"," We don't want to pay me here. "
"4763950","4765770"," Yeah like a super Metro right."
"4767090","4769730"," Yeah I'm at your 22 saying that like a super."
"4770470","4774790"," Do you guys remember when you drive between Colorado Springs and like you drive between CS and"
"4774790","4776190"," Denver and it was like quiet. "
"4777010","4779310"," Do you guys remember when Denver was like dirty and dusty."
"4779870","4782050"," Anybody you guys from Colorado you guys remember that shit."
"4787050","4791230"," Like Denver used to be like a dirty acid he'd go there in the middle of winter and the smog"
"4791230","4794590"," from California would like blank at the city. "
"4796570","4798470"," And you still had all the old cowboy stuff."
"4798650","4799330"," It's still kind of there."
"4800470","4800970"," Excuse me. "
"4803790","4805270"," Yeah like Aurora dude."
"4806970","4808390"," Aurora is like that too."

"4880010","4881290"," You will later on today."
"4882290","4883530"," What's my target on ES. "
"4888530","4890550"," Four thirty six fifty eight minimum."
"4897590","4900030"," Four thirty six fifty eight that's my target on ES."
"4917250","4919610"," Not only is that my upper target. "
"4920690","4923950"," But in the next two weeks you better find yourself a dip to buy."
"4924870","4927830"," So like between now and July at some point."
"4929050","4932030"," You want my upper targets four sixty. "
"4933230","4933890"," Four sixty."
"4935350","4936350"," Yeah four sixty."
"4936930","4939250"," So find a dip to buy to get to four sixty. "
"4941770","4942350"," My."
"4944650","4948330"," I'm looking for a dip to buy on spoons that."

"4960710","4961330"," Somewhere in there."
"4962390","4964350"," If the if the opportunity presents itself. "
"4971710","4974750"," But that would be with like a higher time frame."
"4975750","4978050"," Like a trade for Q three."
"4986770","4988410"," It's kind of gross right here man. "
"4988670","4990070"," I'm watching this right now."

"5012950","5014750"," They're just traded twenty nine cents."
"5015130","5016690"," So they're not trying to pay this at all. "
"5020870","5022270"," Normally this isn't the case."
"5023470","5024430"," It's unusual."
"5032100","5035120"," It's showing that the there's no money right now. "
"5035220","5036120"," No liquidity in the market."
"5039600","5040320"," Vacation week."
"5048850","5050030"," No it's not like yesterday. "

"5055750","5057970"," Yes and now I'm down to twenty six cents on calls. "
"5060450","5061610"," They don't want to pay it."
"5072880","5074240"," Call sellers in the house."
"5075100","5075420"," Right. "
"5081760","5082540"," Vacation week."

"5135770","5136990"," Still no paying."
"5137770","5141250"," Probably should have taken the money here and reentered down here for up here."
"5141250","5142550"," Taking the money. "
"5142790","5143510"," Bought that dip."
"5143670","5144830"," Taking the money and bought this dip."
"5146210","5147990"," But I'm looking for the in a day trade. "
"5148410","5149830"," Normally in a normal week."
"5151130","5155670"," We would just be trending straight up and you'd be paid like you know three hundred three thousand"
"5155670","5156730"," percent or something saying."
"5157270","5158490"," Two thousand percent. "
"5159690","5161630"," Right now still no pay day for me."

"5169310","5170230"," They can say whatever they want."
"5170970","5173310"," We should be going pretty high here so. "
"5174130","5175590"," Let's some catastrophic happened."
"5176130","5179250"," Five minute triggers crossing the one minute trigger right now."

"5309650","5311990"," red lines not going down starting to curve up right. "
"5313690","5314870"," You can see it right."
"5315890","5318670"," Start going to start to see a reversal of the early trigger."
"5320070","5326970"," And also see down here the early is coming up on the 30 minute trade the same thing key point"
"5326970","5330730"," here is what's happening here right there's what we're doing is we're. "
"5331370","5332410"," Turning to the upside."
"5334490","5340710"," I also want you to see a difference between this one right here and where we are so notice how"
"5340710","5342410"," the red line didn't come up and over."
"5343390","5344370"," Didn't join in. "
"5345830","5348150"," This is the beginning of the of the flattening."
"5350070","5351870"," And why am I here trading this."
"5353610","5354850"," And I want to show you why. "
"5384370","5390330"," Because of a move like this here like we're down right down down down below the early trigger and"
"5390330","5391410"," we break above here."
"5392550","5395430"," And there's an explosive move that could be coming."
"5395730","5397950"," So for me at least. "
"5401170","5405970"," Same thing down here like violence and then a giant move to the upside."
"5406870","5412010"," So you can see right here it's nice flattening see the daily moving up."
"5412770","5417110"," Now can we roll over and down and slam into the early yeah we can get down here so we"
"5417110","5419290"," can still actually get down there and then you get the bounce. "
"5420270","5424630"," To the upside so just like down here looking for a dipped by."
"5426150","5430590"," We can also trade sideways here too we can actually consolidate into a month."
"5435240","5439540"," We can bounce down here have the early come back down then it picks us up. "
"5440680","5443440"," I could take us into the first right here's the 30th."
"5444420","5447880"," Right here right the parking action that we talk about like parking the market."
"5448580","5450760"," So there's some danger here for a bull. "
"5451600","5454140"," But why do I have risk on the market."
"5455600","5458120"," Here is because I'm looking for some dips to buy right."
"5458120","5462360"," I don't want to miss this if we start to explode to the upside. "
"5463380","5465280"," Or you get this giant move to the upside."
"5468260","5469320"," That's what I'm looking for."
"5469440","5471080"," We're looking for this to hold right here. "
"5473120","5478120"," And for an explosive move so being shaken out right now they're like hey man got you know you"
"5478120","5478940"," shouldn't be long here."
"5479820","5482660"," And I'm like nah nah I don't think so I think I disagree with you."
"5482860","5484160"," So this is the one minute chart right here. "
"5493420","5497720"," See like no bro we're going to sell it like nah you're not going to sell it right here like"
"5497720","5500200"," nah bro we're going to sell it like nah you're not going to sell it."
"5500760","5503140"," So if they do sell it what am I looking for."
"5507860","5512840"," You can see this white right here rolling over the red rolling over what do I not want to see. "
"5513380","5517220"," I don't want to see a red bar not a wick not a red wick I don't want to see"
"5517220","5517760"," a red bar."
"5519100","5527060"," And then a green bar that fails underneath I don't want to see this."
"5528920","5538660"," And then I don't want to see this right close underneath 432 76 and then a failure to get above"
"5538660","5538980"," it again. "
"5540080","5543940"," On the next candle is a one minute chart but I don't want to see that right if I start"
"5543940","5544560"," to see that."
"5545380","5549140"," They're going to begin to sell this down again right retest this down here."
"5550560","5553960"," And actually get a failure and we'll go down to the depths of hell. "
"5556220","5559840"," So I'm watching this right here I've been long since."
"5561540","5562460"," Leave right here."
"5564180","5569260"," I bought that tip bought that tip bought this tip and just bought this one so building a position"
"5569260","5569960"," to the upside. "
"5570680","5573940"," Series of higher lows there there there and there."
"5575960","5585740"," And this is where they've been selling right you know that too right this"
"5585740","5589260"," green line right here has been like the place to sell the market."
"5589540","5592520"," Like you just come in short it come in short it. "
"5593340","5599720"," Print printing I think it's printed 10 times at this point so you don't stop doing it until it"
"5599720","5600580"," fails to work."
"5601140","5609800"," Or we get close to an indication that it's over right it's kind of looking like it's flattening"
"5609800","5610460"," it's softening."
"5612980","5616280"," We've got the daily down here this is where the danger comes in for a seller. "
"5617060","5622700"," This this daily right here is where the danger is if you're a seller this is not good for you."
"5623860","5629480"," It's like a shark coming up from down below and every day that passes it's coming for you."
"5631200","5635020"," And a closer price gets to it the closer we're going to get a reaction trade. "
"5636500","5637960"," It's right now still long."
"5640200","5646100"," Watching the price of options right now and they're not noticing that they're not paying right now"
"5646100","5647560"," they're like fuck you you're not getting paid."
"5648180","5653520"," So just watching that that price action on the option Jane tells me that they're lying to me. "
"5654900","5658760"," So far to me they're saying yeah fuck you we're not going to pay them and then they come back"
"5658760","5661720"," at 4 p.m. And they're like fucking for three dollars or some shit."
"5666990","5672750"," So I'm still long here buying dips looking to see if we can get a fucking face rep or close"
"5672750","5673770"," some of that bullshit up."
"5674910","5680390"," High and take out especially this stuff up here see all this gap giant gap to fill up here. "
"5681650","5686010"," So give me my 436 and pay me my fucking money."
"5689450","5691790"," Move that over for you so you can see it."
"5694670","5706030"," Sometimes I feel like the market is like a gas lighter. "
"5707670","5711670"," I think you tell somebody no and they're like you got the boss of me and you're like what kind"
"5711670","5711930"," of him."
"5716170","5719650"," And so it's kicking and screaming to go where it's supposed to be going up here."
"5721430","5725050"," Telling you know and you're like nope we're going there. "

"6084980","6087980"," Tag the pivot right there. "
"6089820","6099690"," I'm probably close to flat in the week at"
"6099690","6100090"," this point."
"6103090","6106290"," This pretty much brings me to flat or close enough."
"6106710","6109770"," If I took 40 the 40's right now because I keep loading up. "
"6110870","6112470"," I'm going to be flat here in just a minute."
"6113570","6115510"," I'm pretty deep into the market right now."
"6131320","6133300"," H Y G with a bull. "
"6134500","6136520"," Plane on it on a 15 minute chart."
"6141250","6144570"," N V D A and it's hourly just a note here."
"6146170","6148890"," Take note of this N V D A."
"6149950","6152790"," It's coming up to retest for 12 13. "
"6153590","6158670"," There was a bear plane on the 15 minute or excuse me the one hour for trend on N V"
"6158670","6159110"," D A."
"6159950","6161230"," We'll look at N V D A really quick."
"6165700","6167180"," Be conscious of this."
"6171380","6175140"," Kind of watching N V D A here in the background for good reason. "
"6178620","6179960"," So just right here."
"6181800","6186520"," These sellers here right always market like doom and gloomers."
"6187000","6189460"," So hourly trend on a ticker is pretty important. "
"6193120","6201320"," And it's kind of an important thing right can last for a big price down and also trend down."
"6203060","6205860"," I just want to bring your attention to right here."
"6206960","6212880"," You've got an hourly trend change on N V D A here. "
"6214880","6215720"," Right there."
"6216000","6220040"," What you don't want to see if you're a bull."
"6220700","6225780"," Is for this is setting up for a big move down on on N V D A."
"6226800","6229000"," So when you have the initial sell down here. "
"6229640","6230300"," Watch my cursor."
"6232480","6235660"," You'll normally have a trade higher right here."
"6236980","6241340"," What you don't want to see as a bull is the cell. "
"6242760","6248000"," Like can't get above for 12 33 can't get above for 18 62."
"6248700","6250720"," It's like even if we get up here today."
"6251420","6253180"," What you're really looking for as a bull. "
"6254020","6255120"," Or as a seller."
"6255840","6257480"," As a bull you want to see."
"6258800","6260180"," The close above. "
"6263760","6267560"," Shows that buyers are still have will in here right."
"6269020","6271240"," If you see buyers fail in here."
"6271640","6274240"," This can last for days or weeks to the downside. "
"6275260","6278460"," And it actually leads to a larger super trend on the four hour."
"6278460","6279880"," That's pretty bearish."
"6280780","6282040"," So N V D A."
"6282740","6284280"," You can see right there too. "
"6285600","6286660"," That's a four hour."
"6288520","6289620"," This is a daily."
"6291540","6292720"," An N V D A."
"6293040","6294380"," You get the failure here right. "
"6294700","6296260"," That leads to the down move here."
"6298620","6299620"," Excuse me right there."
"6299940","6304700"," And then that actually leads to a major move to the downside of 285 on N V D A."
"6304700","6308040"," So if you are a market participant like I am. "
"6308600","6311020"," This one hour chart is the one I'm watching."
"6311320","6312680"," So like right here I want to know."
"6313720","6315220"," It doesn't have to over perform. "
"6315820","6316900"," What I want to know is."
"6318640","6321440"," What I want to know as a market participant is."
"6321860","6323040"," Does this confirm. "
"6324220","6326700"," A higher time frame down move."
"6326740","6328740"," So on the hourly."
"6331720","6333700"," This doesn't necessarily bearish. "
"6335380","6338740"," It has to do a few things to become bearish."
"6339780","6341240"," You get the initial sell."
"6342160","6344900"," And if you see the break above here. "
"6346000","6347060"," That's not bearish."
"6347220","6347780"," Just pull back."
"6348080","6348880"," Keep going. "
"6349940","6352440"," It confirms the move is lower on it."
"6353580","6356140"," Four eighteen sixty two four twelve thirty two."
"6356940","6359460"," This is like we're going to be bearish. "
"6359700","6361160"," If I see a rejection there."
"6361560","6363260"," I'll come right up out on you and tell you."
"6363260","6364900"," I expect two weeks down. "
"6366520","6369380"," So we'll know this is going to tell you right now."
"6370320","6373620"," If the move in the mark if this is a viable bottom."
"6374120","6375880"," Even if we trade it sideways it's fine. "
"6377060","6379440"," But this is going to give me a hint as to."
"6381360","6382680"," This is a tradable zone."
"6383520","6387540"," Is this a new high so we can continue to trend higher or. "
"6390140","6392760"," Is the market going to reject up here."
"6394900","6396820"," And we're going to be looking for some some lows."
"6396900","6398760"," We're going to look for like four twelve on the spot. "
"6399860","6403240"," So this is going to set up this whole move right here is going to set up."
"6405460","6406200"," Sideways trade."
"6407460","6408720"," Continuation of the upside trade. "
"6409740","6414160"," Or a super trend for a four hour chart or even a daily chart."
"6415400","6417620"," So if you're a seller, if you're a buyer."
"6418640","6419840"," She paying attention to this. "
"6420720","6422660"," It's a good one to be watching right now."
"6429620","6433820"," It's going to give you a hint as to what's coming down the road."
"6442510","6445930"," Now you can have your your own. "
"6446250","6447750"," You know, I think we're bearish."
"6447770","6448450"," I think we're neutral."
"6448610","6449370"," I think we're bullish. "
"6450490","6453670"," But I can assure you that the market right now as it's positioned."
"6454550","6456090"," Is extremely bullish."
"6456850","6458310"," So I'm expecting that to get bought. "
"6460070","6462790"," Now trading for 33 60 to."
"6464630","6467290"," 434 season now 44 cents."
"6469930","6471670"," Hopefully you're along with me today. "
"6471670","6473550"," They've been buying these dips all along the way."
"6474190","6475650"," You're making a fuck ton of money."
"6476630","6477390"," Like I am. "

"6521570","6523370"," I'm going to fucking scream right now."
"6523370","6524070"," I'm so stoked. "
"6539920","6541140"," Flat right now."
"6541460","6544100"," Just took 56 cents on 434 C."
"6552840","6553740"," Hold on a second."
"6553860","6556380"," I look at some shit and see if I'm up on the week alone. "
"6596010","6599550"," I should be really happy right now."
"6601550","6603090"," But I'm more like."
"6604110","6608610"," I don't think that happy angry. "
"6608930","6608950"," What?"
"6609050","6609510"," That's cool."
"6609650","6610250"," Is that happy angry?"
"6615430","6616870"," It's like round one."
"6617070","6618290"," You're losing round two. "
"6618530","6620810"," Well, I guess round one, I started winning round two."
"6620850","6622690"," I was losing pretty bad."
"6623170","6624550"," Looking at a TKO. "
"6626210","6628210"," But then I knocked him to fuck out."
"6628530","6630970"," So I'm not happy, but I am happy."
"6638340","6640200"," We're in a weird place right now at this moment. "
"6662010","6663510"," Not easy by the dip."
"6671010","6672610"," Now time to have some fun."
"6676070","6677110"," Now we're just in. "
"6677370","6680490"," We're at pure profit now, so we'll see what's up."
"6681450","6683430"," Okay, let's fuck around and find out."
"6686050","6687890"," Let's make some fucking pure money. "
"6690490","6692510"," Hate starting a week, fucking red."
"6692830","6694210"," Well, I didn't start the week, red."
"6694670","6695510"," Sunday I made money. "
"6696190","6697110"," Monday I opened I made money."
"6698070","6700370"," I started fucking turning red yesterday in the afternoon."
"6702690","6704350"," I fucking hate dealers, man. "
"6704530","6704750"," I'm sorry."
"6705050","6706890"," I fucking hate, like I fucking hate theta."
"6707430","6708570"," I used to love theta. "
"6709930","6712350"," But I hate getting burned out of position."
"6712350","6714170"," Watching my shit just die."
"6716610","6717990"," I fucking hate it. "
"6718190","6719230"," Just burns my ass."
"6726220","6731300"," Price is above 6 CMA at 4.33. 3 right now."
"6733340","6735000"," Let's see if I can grab a bar down here. "
"6735140","6736460"," We're in a five minute chart right now."
"6736580","6739640"," I want to see if I can grab 4.33. 53 for another jump higher."
"6739820","6741380"," If you're still long here, I don't blame you. "
"6742140","6743320"," Price starting above, dude."
"6743520","6753040"," Price starting above 4.34. 4.37 and 4.34.69. We've got this giant fucking gap up here to"
"6753040","6753820"," close out to."
"6754860","6756380"," They might get left behind here. "
"6756840","6760200"," I wanted to take some money and book some profit."
"6764150","6767970"," I was actually going to buy back in on 4.34, but I think I'm going to buy less."
"6768950","6774130"," I'm going to try to buy another hundred pack of 4.35, maybe even 4.36. 4.36 or 7"
"6774130","6774410"," cents. "
"6775130","6777630"," These guys are saying we ain't going there and I don't fucking believe them."
"6777630","6784070"," I think dealers are fucking going to get bent here, and they're going to wind up having to jump on"
"6784070","6785790"," the trade with us to follow it."
"6796530","6798790"," I'm looking at 4.35s right now. "
"6798910","6800030"," They're 20 cents currently."
"6804130","6806450"," I got them set up for a hundred pack, so we'll see what's up."
"6808430","6811870"," I'm going to go to a one minute chart because why?"
"6812590","6814470"," Because I want to fucking make some money. "
"6822210","6823690"," Just give me a minute here."
"6824890","6831370"," I'm hoping we can get back down to 4.33.49. I don't know if we get there, but I"
"6831370","6832430"," want to buy this right here."
"6832650","6837030"," I might get left behind in this trade, but that's what I want to buy right there. "
"6838050","6842190"," I'm going to try to keep myself disciplined to take that trade."
"6847560","6848940"," I fucking hate losing."
"6849140","6850080"," I'm going to be honest with you guys. "
"6854040","6855640"," I am very competitive."
"6856260","6861140"," You want to have a little like a fireside chat?"
"6862700","6865320"," My dad was brutal to me as a kid."
"6866980","6872780"," My father raised me to always win, and I never lived up to that for my father. "
"6873880","6876440"," I was never good enough ever."
"6877060","6878720"," It was a tough upbringing."
"6880080","6887000"," But that shit carried over into my schooling, professional life, all that stuff. "
"6887300","6888340"," Like never good enough."
"6889240","6897760"," And when I do lose, I take that shit, and it's like, I'm like worst enemy."
"6902110","6904990"," My own worst enemy, like I have to win. "
"6910070","6911510"," So I feel good right now."
"6913150","6914530"," I don't self-destruct."
"6914770","6918090"," I get more, actually get too better when I'm under that stress. "
"6918450","6919870"," So stress is gone, baby."
"6920470","6921310"," Feeling good right now."
"6922510","6923770"," Now I need a fucking whiskey. "
"6927070","6928750"," Oh, yeah, it eats at me."
"6930390","6934970"," For better or worse."
"6936170","6942930"," I had a coach that helped me manage it for my..."
"6942930","6947470"," I used to actually hurt me, but it actually used to hurt my performance. "
"6948210","6952890"," And I had a coach mentor me to try to turn it into a positive thing."
"6956570","6960150"," I wasn't enjoying myself while winning."
"6965090","6966170"," It's like an angry winner. "
"6970650","6973410"," And then I would lose because I was still angry."
"6974390","6975370"," 430001 right now."
"6975970","6977510"," 430003 and being left behind here. "
"6979330","6980750"," Wish I had stayed in that trade."
"6980990","6982630"," They're trading 65 cents right now."
"6984590","6987830"," They're going to leave me behind and just tag 43469, I think. "
"6998940","7001120"," I'm still down here looking for a jump point."
"7001680","7002620"," It's right here right now."
"7007810","7008790"," They're going to leave me behind. "
"7008950","7009950"," They're just going to blast up here."
"7011350","7012870"," They're going to take out the star one."
"7025290","7026250"," Sorry for that banging. "
"7032060","7032720"," I'm happy."
"7035480","7036040"," I'm good."
"7036320","7036540"," I'm good. "
"7047440","7048240"," I'm good."
"7052460","7054720"," Yeah, no, this was like I'd be a man."
"7054860","7056560"," I had this fucking coach, right?"
"7057380","7061240"," And so he was my coach in other sports. "
"7062040","7064880"," And then he would also end up becoming like the..."
"7065420","7067240"," He was an athletic director for a state."
"7068520","7070420"," For the state soccer association."
"7072660","7075880"," But he was my coach and fucking..."
"7075880","7078140"," I was a multi sport athlete. "
"7078440","7083340"," So when I was young, here's my coach before I went into high school."
"7083820","7088080"," And he coached me through middle school and junior high school."
"7088980","7093200"," And so he would also coach our referee, other sports. "
"7095500","7097560"," And fucking, this is a funny story."
"7099380","7102720"," Trading 43411 right now, trying to go up and tag 43469."
"7104280","7106140"," They've got 43437. "
"7106280","7107800"," Be aware of this one right here."
"7107800","7109380"," So you got PT1, PT2."
"7112380","7115920"," So he would see me playing other sports where I had a different coach. "
"7115980","7117540"," This guy was a mentor to me."
"7118120","7121520"," And so he would like..."
"7121520","7125620"," He'd be like show up as a ref or something, right?"
"7126980","7130860"," And he'd be running down the fucking court, running down the field."
"7132060","7136320"," And he would know exactly when I was eating me up. "
"7136460","7137860"," Like if I missed the pass or something."
"7139540","7145140"," And he would know that it was just burning my ass or I missed the shots or I fucking didn't"
"7145140","7146840"," play D well or something like that."
"7147200","7150080"," So he'd come running up next to me and be like..."
"7150080","7153820"," I was like, he'd just start riding me. "
"7153980","7156000"," He'd be like, is that shit burning you up right now?"
"7156660","7157660"," I can see it."
"7157660","7161880"," Like he'd be like running right next to me as a fucking ref and a game."
"7164180","7167620"," And he'd just rag on me and rag on me and rag on me. "
"7171580","7172860"," He'd be like, is it getting too?"
"7173060","7177300"," Because I can see you're not playing as well if you just let it go and enjoy the game."
"7178040","7179720"," He would just whisper that in my ear."
"7184980","7187820"," He'd just whisper that shit in my fucking air, man. "
"7188300","7190780"," And he had my ass."
"7191040","7191840"," Like he got me."
"7192080","7192600"," He had me. "
"7195060","7202060"," It was like if you had the devil voice in your brain that was hurting you in your performance, he"
"7202060","7207460"," was like the angel trying to teach you how to cope with stress."
"7214410","7216510"," There's my little green box down there."
"7217650","7219330"," Just waiting down here for you. "
"7219890","7220690"," Come on down."
"7221410","7223590"," Come on down and kept Jim's used car lot."
"7228410","7230170"," Some of your calls for cheap. "
"7231230","7232910"," I'll buy them in resale, I promise."
"7235250","7238070"," Matter of fact, if you want to go down there, you can go down there too."
"7238190","7238950"," I'll buy those too. "
"7239590","7242450"," If you want to come down there, fuck yeah."
"7242950","7243730"," Let's do it."
"7252150","7253570"," 1141, trend day. "
"7256050","7257670"," Just give me this one right here."
"7260050","7261590"," One fucking buy down there."
"7262930","7273730"," I want"
"7273730","7275170"," another run for like two hours. "
"7276470","7278030"," They're like, no, you have to buy them here."
"7278190","7279370"," I'm like, nah, I don't want to buy them there."
"7279690","7280770"," Come on down just a little bit. "
"7282150","7283070"," Come on, dealers."
"7284290","7285410"," Put the price down there for me."
"7287090","7296230"," I might have to put a stink bit down here. "
"7296250","7296750"," Hold on here."
"7308680","7309660"," I'm going to fuck you."
"7309740","7311220"," I got a stink bit on the market right now. "
"7313180","7314540"," The big old fuck you."
"7314660","7316700"," Come down here and see me for 15 cents."
"7325680","7327000"," Smart money is lower, buddy. "
"7339560","7341540"," Come on down and kept Jim's used car lot."
"7342740","7343920"," Turn your calls in."
"7344060","7344820"," I'll buy them from you. "
"7356870","7357250"," Shit."
"7357750","7358570"," It's going to leave me behind."
"7358750","7359210"," I already know it. "
"7363270","7365350"," We're about to blast off here in the next few minutes."
"7365610","7367190"," We're going to rip some faces off here."
"7367370","7368270"," You guys ready for it?"
"7372150","7373850"," They ain't coming down here to my green box. "
"7374270","7375250"," It's like, fuck you, no."
"7384420","7385640"," Take my stink bit off."
"7389220","7391960"," I'm hoping that a bit pulls price down a little bit. "
"7394080","7403400"," You know, if we all put a stink bit in, that would be illegal, I think."
"7409310","7410490"," We're back on it again."
"7417450","7419990"," I'd have a little bit of double top action going on. "
"7420750","7421230"," HYG."
"7421950","7422850"," Powering right now."
"7424250","7424730"," Vicks. "
"7424830","7425530"," Very bearish."
"7428990","7430350"," Couple things could happen here."
"7431490","7436010"," We're either going to get the push and roll, like, man up here and then roll it down. "
"7438330","7441890"," It's possible we could roll down for some support to make that leg up."
"7443570","7444390"," I'm watching."
"7444790","7446290"," It looks like we're going to do the squeeze. "
"7446850","7448790"," It does look like this is the move."
"7448790","7450310"," move the VIX at least."
"7452430","7453850"," I'm going to show you the VIX right here. "
"7454690","7455670"," What I'm talking about."
"7467930","7470410"," So I'm looking for that squeeze in the spy."
"7472090","7472810"," So ready. "
"7474290","7477590"," If a couple bars down, that'll give you the spy squeeze."
"7479330","7482590"," I'm not anti the roll back up here, then the down move."
"7484210","7486470"," That would be the rolling and dip by. "
"7487110","7488650"," It's a 15 minute chart in the VIX."
"7489130","7490830"," Close this bullshit gap down here."
"7493450","7496190"," We could just grind it down and that's where you get your squeeze. "
"7496710","7497390"," Bam, bam, bam."
"7498770","7502890"," And that gives you the shortable spoons, but not high."
"7511190","7513010"," So they're like leaving me behind right now. "
"7514750","7519510"," So what you have happens is you've got VIX rolls, closes that gap."
"7519910","7521450"," You get a quick rip up here."
"7523430","7524410"," Slams in R1. "
"7530080","7531480"," I don't want to chase this though."
"7531660","7537630"," So I always like to pull back."
"7540210","7541970"," Might ask why I'm saying that. "
"7542930","7544670"," I bought these dips all the way up."
"7545050","7548850"," See one there, one there, one there, down there about the red, one there."
"7550130","7551290"," So if I can get that, I will. "
"7551490","7553570"," But if I can't, I get left behind on this one."
"7560140","7562280"," We have higher price targets as well."
"7563340","7566480"," I think I told you earlier this morning, what was I looking for?"
"7566880","7567440"," 436 and change. "
"7570000","7572120"," So all this right here, 436, 18."
"7572300","7575000"," I was looking for this morning, 436, 58 up here."
"7578110","7579090"," Here's PT1. "
"7579230","7580050"," Here's PT2."
"7580910","7581590"," We have more to go."
"7582330","7601830"," I haven't"
"7601830","7602190"," done pullback. "
"7602490","7603730"," Just give me a pullback."
"7605210","7606370"," I think that's all you get."
"7606670","7607230"," Listen right here. "
"7609190","7610690"," I don't think I get PT5."
"7611590","7622700"," I bought that"
"7622700","7623300"," down there."
"7623840","7625020"," So you can get this. "
"7625360","7627400"," If I don't think we're getting it, but if I can get it."
"7629620","7630060"," Sweet."
"7631140","7633060"," There's like a quick bloodbath down here. "
"7633860","7635360"," Buy that for up there."
"7636540","7637100"," On it."
"7637340","7637820"," Take it. "
"7640440","7641260"," Give it to me."
"7641360","7641720"," I'll do it."
"7668800","7684380"," That one right"
"7684380","7684700"," there. "
"7684920","7685880"," And this one right here."
"7687580","7688560"," That one right there."
"7691870","7692990"," And this one right here. "
"7693390","7694730"," So watch my cursor right there."
"7712460","7714320"," Yeah, price is still holding up too."
"7716360","7718040"," 435s are at 20 cents right now. "
"7718120","7721600"," They're not giving up these fucking, they're not fucking giving me the price that I want."
"7725060","7726320"," 435s are 20 cents."
"7730670","7731650"," Like fuck you. "
"7731770","7732470"," Cook jump on board."
"7738450","7739850"," Now they're 22 cents."
"7741050","7742030"," No buy for me still. "
"7749940","7751860"," I want to buy it though."
"7752020","7752380"," Really bad."
"7787430","7787830"," 435c's. "
"7790380","7792700"," So here's some."
"7792860","7793760"," I should probably talk about this."
"7797040","7802200"," So I just unloaded a bunch of calls right. "
"7802940","7807740"," So I just unloaded a few hundred fucking calls."
"7808160","7818160"," So when I'm trying to re-enter the market, I don't take that money and like buy the same"
"7818160","7821040"," price calls or buy 300 or 500."
"7821900","7823860"," Like I'm starting small again. "
"7824060","7825020"," So like 435."
"7826160","7827380"," I was on 434."
"7827720","7829640"," Now I'm trying to buy something cheaper, right?"
"7830560","7838960"," So I don't want to spend 56 cents or 57 cents again. "
"7838960","7840720"," I don't want to buy 62 cent calls."
"7841040","7849680"," I want to put that money in my bank and go back in at like 24 cents and put some"
"7849680","7850620"," risk on here, right?"
"7851040","7853560"," Now I'm not going to buy 300 contracts right here."
"7853680","7854660"," A lot of you guys do that shit. "
"7855020","7855700"," I didn't know that."
"7855960","7862020"," Like a lot of you guys will like just roll into a higher sizing."
"7862460","7864100"," You guys size up all the time. "
"7864320","7866140"," Not all of you, but a lot of you do you size up."
"7866360","7868700"," Like I just made fucking 20 grand."
"7869060","7870860"," So fucking I'm going to buy 20 grand in calls. "
"7871540","7872360"," I don't do that."
"7872520","7881020"," I go back down and like start with 25."
"7883520","7886060"," And I buy cheaper options. "
"7898590","7899810"," Well, I take profit."
"7900130","7902010"," If you guys want to know, I actually take profit."
"7902610","7904550"," And I remove money from my account too. "
"7904970","7907790"," So my day trading account, I take money out of it and I start again."
"7911090","7914070"," I don't trade my whole account day trading."
"7914890","7919920"," I have an investment account. "
"7920300","7922760"," You guys have like an investment account, a savings account."
"7923380","7925240"," I have real estate."
"7925880","7927840"," I have an account that I trade spreads in. "
"7930380","7931360"," You should too."
"7931540","7934240"," If you don't, you should do that."
"7935020","7936980"," So I don't care. "
"7937260","7939880"," I guess if you don't have a thousand bucks or something, you couldn't do it."
"7939940","7946700"," But even if you have like 10 grand or something, like you should put like some money into an"
"7946700","7947680"," interest bearing account."
"7949380","7951660"," I was talking to a winky about it over the weekend. "
"7951660","7953440"," We're hanging out this weekend."
"7953460","7958900"," And I'm like, when I hear people say they blow up a million dollar account, I'm like, why the fuck"
"7958900","7967900"," wouldn't you just put that million dollars into an interest bearing account and use that 5%, 6% to"
"7967900","7973580"," fund your misadventures trading options or futures."
"7974940","7977780"," It seems like a no brainer. "
"7978160","7984380"," And then if you have a winning week or a winning year, you take those winnings out and you add"
"7984380","7985820"," that to your investment account."
"7987220","7991460"," And then over time, if you blow an account up, it's not a big deal."
"7992140","7999060"," When you take money out of the market and put it into something that makes you money, over time"
"7999060","8001700"," you're able to cover losses. "
"8004160","8007760"," And then it funds you to take a loss."
"8009220","8010360"," But I don't understand that."
"8011670","8020380"," Winky says he's going to do an entire series on this for people on the website. "
"8020380","8022440"," So that'll take some time."
"8022940","8032780"," But we're trying to discuss the development of basic financing"
"8032780","8034720"," for trading the stock market."
"8035620","8040160"," It's like, where do you get your money to trade the stock market?"
"8040960","8044500"," How to grow, let's say you're a new trader or new investor. "
"8046040","8052620"," How do you like, let's say you're watching me right now and you're a new person in the stock"
"8052620","8053020"," market."
"8054840","8061300"," Like, there are ways to grow an account that I'm not particularly against."
"8064800","8069360"," One of those ways is you take the 10 trade challenge, right?"
"8069560","8070600"," You hear about it out there. "
"8070800","8075960"," Some of you may or may not know about it, but you take 10 perfect trades."
"8076340","8079160"," I'll see people on the internet say that you can't do that."
"8079340","8079660"," That's false. "
"8081540","8082380"," You can."
"8084180","8089820"," And some people purport that you can just like work a job."
"8090440","8093980"," You have extra extra cash every week and you take a risky trade. "
"8094920","8095720"," I've done that."
"8095980","8103220"," I haven't done it with a job, but I've done very risky trades with low money, five grand."
"8104380","8107860"," And they've printed big money, six figures. "
"8108660","8112780"," If you do that like 10 times, sure, you'll grow an account to where you can manage it."
"8113200","8119280"," So I'm not completely anti that thing, but there's an easier way to do it."
"8121620","8123520"," Well, that doesn't cost you anything. "
"8124040","8125960"," There's a better way to do it."
"8127840","8135720"," One of the, and Winky talks about it sometimes in the stream in that that includes pretty basic"
"8135720","8145340"," dipeye on the screen box right here going up the tag PT one trading four 34 31 32 right now."
"8145340","8146420"," I didn't take the trade. "
"8146540","8147280"," I should have, but I didn't."
"8149260","8150380"," I was being greedy."
"8158540","8166420"," And I think what him and I have talked about oftentimes is you know, if you work a job and"
"8166420","8171240"," you have that extra cash and you want to gamble it until it hits I know that's a pervasive"
"8171240","8174880"," prevalent trading strategy, believe it or not. "
"8176080","8179840"," It really does, though, open the door to bad habits."
"8180680","8182720"," Normally, when you do, I did that."
"8183280","8188640"," And what you do is you blow up your account and you go back to square one and you work"
"8188640","8189360"," your way through it. "
"8189440","8190040"," It takes years."
"8191000","8193360"," You trade larger size, so you can handle it."
"8193500","8198400"," You make a bunch of huge mistakes that are very costly to you. "
"8200660","8205540"," As time passed though, like you blow up accounts and eventually you're like, you do it the right"
"8205540","8205740"," way."
"8205860","8211500"," And the right way is you take the money that you make from your job, whatever your career is."
"8213340","8218540"," And there's different things you can do, but an interest bearing account is one of them. "
"8218840","8219740"," It's like step one."
"8220340","8222760"," And I was fascinated by Winky saying that to me."
"8222760","8227200"," I think the first time he said it to me was like a year ago, he's like, these fucking people"
"8227200","8229420"," don't have fucking basic fucking savings accounts. "
"8229420","8230100"," I'm like, what?"
"8230299","8236580"," He's like, yeah, he's like, they could just be putting their money into a fucking savings account"
"8236580","8239100"," or an interest bearing account that pays five or six percent."
"8240160","8242740"," And they could just use that money to trade the market."
"8243240","8247340"," And it's like a permanent fund, a permanent fuck around fund. "
"8247680","8248580"," Think of it like that, right?"
"8251120","8256160"," So if every week you have money left over from your job at Wendy's, just put that money into that"
"8256160","8259480"," account and you grow that account."
"8260860","8261600"," That's what you do."
"8261719","8262360"," You grow that account. "
"8262780","8267200"," And as that account makes you five percent, six percent."
"8267360","8271000"," And that doesn't sound like a lot, but it is."
"8278120","8283299"," It helps fund and, you know, it's weird because I'm like, I say Wendy's, but I don't mean Wendy's. "
"8283820","8285900"," But I know a lot of you guys out there have money."
"8286200","8287540"," Like a lot of you guys have a million bucks."
"8287680","8288940"," A lot of you guys have half a million. "
"8289440","8292240"," And you're trading that million dollar account."
"8292340","8294299"," And I'm like, why are they trading a million dollar accounts?"
"8295620","8299260"," And have that million dollar account making me money somewhere."
"8301459","8307700"," And whatever money I made from that million dollars, I'd be fucking, you could be selling calls"
"8307700","8309219"," against Vanguard. "
"8309680","8311500"," You could be selling puts against Vanguard."
"8312780","8313639"," You name it."
"8313879","8314740"," OTM stuff. "
"8316379","8317719"," Three Sigma move stuff."
"8317900","8319240"," You could be selling that shit to people."
"8319879","8320700"," That'll fund you. "
"8322440","8325480"," You could buy a house and take the fucking rent money from it."
"8326200","8327980"," There's a million different things you could be doing."
"8328660","8331820"," I'm using like a basic bank account as the example. "
"8332160","8340280"," But there are all kinds of appreciating assets and low risk money making for your million dollars,"
"8340280","8342799"," right?"
"8343180","8344280"," You could diversify it."
"8345760","8347520"," It's who's slightly more risky."
"8348360","8354540"," But you know, there's a blend of that stuff there that can give you the the funds that are kind"
"8354540","8358480"," of fucking free to put risk on. "
"8361200","8367200"," So that you can take the 10 trade challenge or you can make one risky trade a year."
"8367520","8368459"," I mean, think about that, right?"
"8369219","8370520"," Put your money in a bank account."
"8371320","8372200"," See like a new trader. "
"8372980","8375240"," So you start banking money for an entire year."
"8375840","8377980"," You don't take a single fucking trade."
"8378139","8379540"," You just educate yourself. "
"8380400","8383299"," I think a year later, you wait for that one trade of the year."
"8384459","8386080"," That one super low."
"8386920","8388620"," So let's look at this year. "
"8389180","8389900"," 2023."
"8390040","8390560"," It's like a 2024."
"8392040","8400420"," I'm probably going to expect at least a moment between now and 2025 where the market trades down to"
"8400420","8407260"," 350 360 high probability, not about 100%. "
"8407260","8414480"," But high probability there'll be a moment trade 360 bloodbath for some stupid reason."
"8415980","8421400"," It's like a terrorist attack or something or I don't fucking know some lame ass reason why the"
"8421400","8422420"," market goes down, right?"
"8425120","8428920"," You could probably bank for an entire year and not take a single fucking trade."
"8429140","8430000"," Wait for that one day. "
"8431260","8433420"," And boom, there's your fucking trade."
"8436900","8442340"," Buy some buy some big calls like three, four months out and you got a trade."
"8445500","8447100"," We don't do that shit though, do we?"
"8449860","8451180"," Yeah, collect the dividend, man. "
"8451380","8451680"," Fuck yeah."
"8453420","8454780"," And gamble that shit."
"8455160","8456900"," So if you're wrong, you're at least have some money. "
"8457420","8460320"," You're like, oh, I have more money to gamble against."
"8460540","8460640"," Sweet."
"8463840","8471700"," Until you're able to build an account and now all that tube aside, like all that shit aside, if"
"8471700","8479540"," you're eventually successful, there's another problem which is you have to remove the fucking money"
"8479540","8480480"," from the stock market. "
"8480820","8482880"," So like there's another issue here."
"8483080","8488340"," Once you are a successful trader, you need to move that money out of there, you know, and like put"
"8488340","8490240"," it elsewhere and like put it another shit."
"8494520","8498840"," You know, you have to put it somewhere less risky to continue to grow money for you. "
"8500560","8505840"," With low risk, you know, and you don't have to always buy it."
"8505940","8510180"," I mean, you can you figure, let's say you're buying the spy or let's say you're making money in the"
"8510180","8510960"," stock market, right?"
"8511180","8517660"," We're kind of in a bull market right now, but you know, you put your winnings in real estate or"
"8517660","8523120"," you put your winnings in an interest-bearing account and you don't have to necessarily buy to spy"
"8523120","8530040"," today, but you can fucking make a Google alert and say, well, if we ever get down to fucking 3500,"
"8530120","8532680"," I'll go back and buy the fucking spooze with that money."
"8532800","8534020"," I'm putting an interest-bearing account. "
"8535080","8537840"," Setting a fucking alert on a fucking trade and view an email."
"8538920","8540320"," Hello, we're down here."
"8540820","8542660"," Remember that money you put in that interest-bearing account?"
"8542960","8543940"," Buy me right fucking now. "
"8551760","8554820"," P.T.1 tagged Lammo."
"8557520","8559460"," That's the same with a day trading account, right?"
"8559840","8565460"," You know, that's how you blow up a day trading account, making all this money, walking around like"
"8565460","8566540"," a ton of money."
"8567260","8571860"," You know, you know how many guys don't take that money out and buy spreads or sell spreads to"
"8571860","8572100"," people?"
"8572100","8573080"," Fucking most of them. "
"8574320","8582160"," And when you hear like 73% of market retail market participants are losers, there's a large"
"8582160","8584500"," percentage of those that are good trainers, good investors."
"8585620","8588300"," What they don't do is manage that money thereafter."
"8589880","8596180"," If we go from a bull market to a low liquidity bear market, volatile market, they don't exit the"
"8596180","8596500"," market. "
"8597960","8604060"," They don't manage those winnings either, so they slowly lose all that money as time progresses."
"8607020","8610780"," So right now it's 12.04. We had a new high."
"8611420","8614040"," Congratulations bulls at 12 o'clock. "
"8614800","8616540"," The hour is in the bull's favor."
"8617440","8620560"," We'll see if we are the half hour, excuse me, is in the bull's favor."
"8622020","8630950"," We're going to be targeting the next price target above, which is R1.P.T.2. And you can kind"
"8630950","8633570"," of apply these things to a small account. "
"8636930","8642030"," One of the biggest problems here though is that people fucking, you make an account, right?"
"8642650","8644750"," So you take 10 grand and you turn into 100."
"8645330","8648710"," You start trading that $100,000 account like it's nobody's business."
"8649550","8650390"," And it's gone. "
"8650690","8651610"," You end up losing it."
"8652030","8654390"," You have to diversify those winnings."
"8655050","8656070"," You have to. "
"8656710","8660490"," And you also have to limit what you're trading."
"8660930","8663070"," Like you should not be sizing up like crazy."
"8663870","8668070"," If you have like a $100,000 account, you should be fucking going right back down there and trading"
"8668070","8669590"," the grand, two grand, three grand. "
"8670130","8675510"," Shouldn't be fucking sizing like $6,000, $30,000 trades, risky trades."
"8676190","8677350"," Just don't do it."
"8678030","8683170"," If you're going to do it, buy fucking Vanguard, buy fucking S&P 500. "
"8684410","8686810"," If you told me that, I'd be like, yeah, I'll eventually come back."
"8687450","8690290"," You told me you bought like 100,000, like $100,000 account."
"8690510","8690790"," What'd you do?"
"8691350","8693730"," I bought shares of GME because it's coming back. "
"8694010","8694650"," Like that's just crazy."
"8695330","8696490"," Like I can't get behind that."
"8697210","8698550"," Like I don't understand that. "
"8701070","8703950"," If you said you bought Apple, I'd be like, yeah, all right, I get that."
"8704270","8707090"," I bought some fucking Tesla or something or I bought Microsoft."
"8707930","8710690"," I get that trading 434, 41 right now. "
"8710870","8711510"," Second test."
"8712090","8717530"," Just pinging right off that five minute chart to the upside right now, five minute, 20, 70, am I?"
"8720450","8721890"," Just cranking right now."
"8724210","8726210"," Trading 434, 45. "
"8730810","8734550"," So a wiki supposedly is going to write all this stuff out for you."
"8735330","8738590"," Like if this then that kind of stuff, right?"
"8738790","8739510"," Do you have this?"
"8739690","8740450"," Do you not have this?"
"8743490","8744910"," Just educational stuff."
"8748630","8755250"," My friends and I that trade and invest, we do this stuff in general and we've done quite well doing"
"8755250","8755450"," it. "
"8755610","8759830"," So I haven't met anyone that hasn't done well doing it in my life."
"8759990","8766210"," I never met somebody that said, I remember a matter of fact, Joe Donut, his father is a market"
"8766210","8768030"," participant and investor in the market."
"8769110","8774590"," And last year, we were talking about taking money off the table. "
"8775930","8781430"," Not last year, excuse me, 2020, 2021, excuse me."
"8783810","8787410"," Just look for the next bull run, next bottom in the market."
"8788070","8790030"," We're not this guy's old, right?"
"8790150","8794750"," This guy, he's looking to buy like Vanguard, S&P 500 target. "
"8796850","8800730"," The Walmart's out there, Amazon, that kind of stuff."
"8808450","8812550"," And you know, it's part of the process for you if you're a market participant."
"8815610","8820750"," Take your money out of the market, put it into something safe, right?"
"8822960","8826020"," You knew they were coming for us right last year, we knew they were coming for us. "
"8826640","8828620"," So they were going to come tax us, right?"
"8829520","8831840"," Talked about buying real estate past couple of years."
"8834160","8839500"," You saw the big, the big money shift out of the stock market in a real estate two years ago,"
"8839500","8840480"," whatever, three years ago."
"8841600","8843440"," Mad rush, big, mad rush in the gold. "
"8855710","8857510"," Yeah, exactly trying to outrun inflation."
"8858530","8859450"," Remember that trade, Joe?"
"8860210","8862570"," Dude, like Joe's in here with us right now."
"8862750","8867390"," So Joe and I a lot of two years ago, we're like, we're like, okay, we have to outrun inflation. "
"8868090","8869350"," The stock market's not paying."
"8870090","8871310"," We have to outrun inflation."
"8872110","8874630"," And then we know the next step is taxation, right?"
"8874870","8877990"," It's like inflation, you're out running, then you're out running taxes. "
"8881210","8888650"," I think that's part of this trade up is Joe and I were talking about this two months ago or"
"8888650","8889150"," some, right?"
"8894240","8903100"," It was like, every place to outrun inflation in taxes, all that money has been like past two, three"
"8903100","8910360"," years, it's like out of the stock, out of spec growth, then all that money ran into corporate debt"
"8910360","8915740"," bond, fucking companies like Apple, Tesla, all that shit, then like ran into safety."
"8916060","8916600"," Remember that trade?"
"8918100","8921500"," Then you saw like BlackRock and all these banks buying up properties."
"8922060","8923760"," They got that money ran out, right?"
"8923920","8925160"," It's like it's like a big herd. "
"8928540","8935080"," And then this year we were talking about, you spend a couple, two, three years out running"
"8935080","8939120"," inflation in taxes, but your money isn't making you any money."
"8940660","8942140"," It's like just surviving."
"8943120","8946820"," It's getting dinged along the way, ding here, ding there, ding here. "
"8948480","8954160"," And so it's like this part of this trade is like money on the sidelines."
"8954560","8958720"," That's like, all right, I dodged all these bullets."
"8958980","8962260"," Now it's time to put 20% on, 30% on for a year. "
"8962400","8963000"," Let's just party."
"8965820","8974460"," Let's play musical chairs again and we'll weed out some more bulls in my quest for profit."
"8978460","8980120"," Let's get another round of bulls in there. "
"8980300","8981040"," We'll leave some more hanging."
"9000720","9008420"," Yeah, a few of a million dollars, you can pretty much through a blend of low risks stuff like"
"9008420","9018620"," between bonds, make a blend of bonds, savings, money market stuff, and"
"9018620","9023440"," some low risk dividend buys."
"9023980","9030460"," You can feed bought an S&P 500 product down low at 3500. "
"9030620","9033120"," You bought some of those bonds they were offering with a great interest rate."
"9033120","9035180"," I think they're paying 7% or something like that."
"9036480","9042280"," And I think a blend of that kind of shade you can probably do right around, make right around"
"9042280","9047040"," probably 10, 12% somewhere in there. "
"9047260","9054700"," Some real estate buy a rental house or something like that, where you have a high percentage of"
"9054700","9056780"," renters spend a hundred grand on that maybe."
"9057480","9059900"," Yeah, that's that's eight hundred to a thousand bucks a month."
"9060620","9064180"," You have a million dollars, you can go buy a you can still buy a hundred thousand dollar house"
"9064180","9067920"," right now with a tenant in it that pays you every month. "
"9071460","9075060"," Yeah, they're just probably you probably make somewhere around."
"9077500","9079300"," Oh no, a couple grand a month."
"9080380","9083760"," Five grand a month maybe if you're if you're really risk or a little risk. "
"9089100","9090380"," You use that trade."
"9093040","9095000"," Take that five grand turn into 30."
"9096340","9098560"," Take out a 25 of it. "
"9100220","9101700"," Yeah, go back to five again."
"9103180","9106500"," Take that 25 buy something that appreciates."
"9107260","9108140"," Do it again. "
"9109820","9113220"," Then you blow up an account and you go back and pull out another five grand."
"9118560","9121340"," Before you know you get a hundred thousand dollar account, you can put some risk on."
"9122340","9125100"," You got a bunch of other accounts that are paying you regardless. "
"9128180","9130160"," I like that whole sizing up thing, man."
"9130340","9131480"," The thing bothers me."
"9132240","9133800"," Well, it doesn't bother me. "
"9133900","9136700"," It bothers me when you're sizing up from like a hundred thousand dollar account."
"9136980","9137960"," Like you have to have a larger account."
"9145100","9146860"," Yeah, you get out of the system, congrats. "
"9146860","9148260"," That's the other part of it too."
"9150120","9153020"," Winky just made a comment and there's another part this too."
"9153200","9157040"," Like someone asked me or John L and I were talking. "
"9157720","9161620"," He was John and I were talking and he's like, do you think these trades print?"
"9162060","9163160"," And I'm like, they print every time."
"9164480","9165940"," Like there's not many of them every year."
"9166860","9169340"," He's like, then why do you not do it?"
"9169540","9170860"," And I was like, I'll be honest with you. "
"9172300","9174980"," I'm like, why do you not just take those trades?"
"9175320","9176680"," And I'll be like, I'm like, I'm honest."
"9180300","9181900"," I have no control."
"9182480","9188180"," Like I'll take those trades, make money, and then I go back into the market and I think I'm smart. "
"9189040","9193560"," I'm like, yeah, I'm going to trade day trades or I'm going to put some more risk over here or"
"9193560","9195000"," Tesla's running right now."
"9195000","9197820"," So I'm going to take that trade, right?"
"9201870","9206790"," So it's like over trading, which is very common."
"9207010","9207630"," I'm guilty of it. "
"9207630","9208230"," I'll be honest with you."
"9208270","9209150"," I'm fucking guilty of it."
"9210950","9213650"," Over trading, not trading when you shouldn't be. "
"9214250","9219690"," That's part of the reason why we have so much news in our market, right?"
"9220550","9221310"," Keep you entertained."
"9222170","9223270"," Keep you at the table."
"9227890","9230170"," You know, it's like we that's why we have CNBC, man. "
"9230250","9233870"," Like the, that's why we don't have like PBS a news hour."
"9234450","9237270"," You don't go there for your stock information, right?"
"9238610","9241690"," You want to know all the spiciness that's going on out there."
"9243510","9247290"," You want to read all the fan fiction, the bear fiction. "
"9250350","9251310"," It's like an outlet."
"9252670","9255430"," It's an outlet for people to gamble."
"9263460","9263900"," Yeah. "
"9264000","9265360"," Over trading is an account killer, man."
"9265940","9266380"," 100%."
"9266380","9270070"," Make place your trade. "
"9270310","9270570"," Walk away."
"9270710","9271730"," Don't come back for a little while."
"9281530","9282870"," To that right there, baby. "
"9283090","9283290"," Whoo."
"9284110","9289290"," With that big dog up there right there, waiting to smash on through."
"9291370","9293430"," Those four 35s are now 30 cents. "
"9294410","9296070"," They were down to 20 cents down here."
"9297870","9299670"," They hit 20 cents right there."
"9301130","9302150"," Now trade 30. "
"9302390","9303290"," They're not paying a lot today."
"9304050","9305610"," They're being cheap with payouts."
"9308050","9314890"," PT two right here, 43469, PT three, three, 43503, big boy above. "
"9316110","9317930"," See that bad boy right there?"
"9319090","9321350"," R two, 43618."
"9322970","9324450"," That's Valhalla up here."
"9325510","9327050"," Giant gap right here. "
"9327790","9328270"," Giant."
"9330350","9335510"," Expect volatility right there."
"9336310","9337150"," See if I get this right. "
"9337470","9338250"," Just double check."
"9341980","9342520"," Yeah."
"9342740","9344320"," So I want you guys to see something here. "
"9345160","9353210"," I want you to be aware of this, okay?"
"9357610","9359370"," Sellers, big sellers right here."
"9360070","9361830"," Big sellers right here."
"9363050","9368370"," They want to step back in right now and sell you right here, okay?"
"9369650","9371470"," Next big sellers are up here. "
"9373830","9374950"," All right."
"9375090","9376450"," So this is their line right here."
"9376570","9377590"," They're telling you get fucked. "
"9378510","9380290"," We're going to roll this down on you again."
"9382430","9386570"," If you beat these sellers right here, right?"
"9387030","9389630"," We're a moon mission straight up here."
"9392250","9394250"," So this here is high volatility. "
"9394570","9395230"," I want you to know that."
"9395410","9397470"," So right here, high volatility right in here."
"9401510","9403610"," So I'm going to show you something else here, okay?"
"9406350","9408010"," You guys got a screenshot of that?"
"9410150","9411730"," So I want to show you something. "
"9412430","9414410"," Now what I'm going to give you guys a lesson."
"9414550","9416110"," If you long calls, you should close them."
"9416750","9418430"," I'm going to give you guys a lesson here, okay?"
"9419590","9421810"," So you already know that the sellers are here, right?"
"9422770","9424810"," They're not the strongest sellers, but they're big. "
"9426050","9427550"," You guys know what they're doing in here."
"9428750","9433830"," So if you want to get up there and squeeze this, what do you need to squeeze it?"
"9434410","9438650"," That little yellow line right there is likely not strong enough."
"9440190","9443310"," So you more than likely need some help from friends. "
"9444090","9448350"," At minimum, your friends on this white line right here, you probably need help from them."
"9450870","9452550"," You need these guys to help you out."
"9453630","9455290"," And you've got this green line down here. "
"9455410","9456990"," This is the big bad boy right here."
"9457510","9461230"," Probably need this guy to come up a little bit to help."
"9461230","9462970"," So can you get up here?"
"9463370","9463470"," Yes. "
"9464250","9466570"," Are you going to get up there at this yellow line right here?"
"9466790","9467610"," Likely no."
"9468990","9469510"," Possible."
"9470390","9471270"," Likely no. "
"9471530","9472830"," So what happens to get up there?"
"9475330","9475850"," Right?"
"9476270","9477990"," Well, there's two things we can do."
"9479850","9485310"," Price can consolidate until the help arrives."
"9489270","9491770"," Price can consolidate one here. "
"9499930","9504090"," And move down until more help arrives."
"9505090","9508330"," Now you have the one in the five minute helping you out, consolidation."
"9509490","9510710"," Big move higher, right?"
"9511570","9514630"," Buyers here, buyers here helping out the six EMA buyers. "
"9517490","9520510"," And then you've got the bad boy down here that's going to move higher, right?"
"9520890","9520890"," Hopefully."
"9521750","9523850"," So we're going to look and see if it's going to help or not."
"9527540","9529440"," We know the sellers are there, right?"
"9530040","9531280"," We know they're right here. "
"9531920","9532800"," They want to sell."
"9533100","9533540"," So what do we need?"
"9533980","9536200"," We need this one to catch up, right?"
"9539380","9540160"," Lend to hand."
"9541240","9541680"," Solidates. "
"9548660","9550880"," Need this bad boy to come up in here, right?"
"9555280","9558380"," Probably even better if this one comes up right now."
"9559320","9560920"," At least this right here, right?"
"9564640","9567320"," Get that yellow line to come down here and help out."
"9571000","9578240"," And if it can't, down here and help out, this bad boy's coming up here too, and this one's coming. "
"9578660","9588080"," So even if we roll here, a big roll, this is a 27 or excuse me, 129 EMA, a 27."
"9588640","9590360"," Eventually, this is going to come up here today."
"9592420","9592820"," Right?"
"9593020","9593860"," It's going to lend to hand. "
"9594060","9597120"," The white comes under the yellow comes under, and you get the push that you need to get"
"9597120","9597940"," breakthrough this."
"9601980","9607520"," So where we are right now seems like a place to consolidate at least, right?"
"9610080","9611260"," There's a five minute chart."
"9611540","9612080"," We'll go to one minute. "
"9613560","9620790"," Put that one right there."
"9623210","9624190"," See it right there?"
"9624390","9625210"," It's trying to hold on."
"9627370","9628650"," Five minute chart right here. "
"9633350","9637630"," Now if price stays above the six EMA, bulls are still in charge, right?"
"9637850","9639210"," They can't actually squeeze through this."
"9640050","9642130"," So we'll watch this, pay attention to it."
"9643490","9648450"," Now what's another thing we can decipher from this is this previous high right here. "
"9649710","9651170"," So if you're like, yeah, fuck you, Cap."
"9651350","9653110"," We don't need all that support to get up there."
"9653650","9654550"," This is what you want to see. "
"9654930","9655850"," Take the next trade."
"9656690","9657890"," You want to see green bar."
"9658090","9658510"," Get above. "
"9662430","9663890"," You want to see a red bar down."
"9666290","9668390"," And you'll take the next trade right here."
"9669670","9670470"," Green bar up. "
"9672990","9675470"," You don't take this trade until it's right here."
"9681090","9683690"," This is your consolidation range right here."
"9685710","9688050"," This is where traders get fucked up in here. "
"9688690","9691270"," The downside they get trapped, they get fucked."
"9691730","9695270"," You need to see price get above first, validate the move higher."
"9696090","9699610"," This is your next, this is your next leg right here. "
"9701090","9703490"," Okay, next leg right here."
"9704830","9708810"," So you're looking to see what happens in here before you take a trade."
"9708810","9710350"," This is where we are right now. "
"9711010","9712610"," Remember this previous high right here."
"9712690","9714470"," This is a five minute chart right there."
"9718370","9719370"," Do it on a one minute. "
"9721230","9722050"," See it right here."
"9738870","9741170"," You want to see one, two, three, four."
"9741810","9742210"," Boom. "
"9743590","9743590"," Up."
"9744690","9744690"," Hold."
"9745970","9747570"," Be ready to take that trade right there. "
"9751380","9751860"," Got it."
"9766660","9768940"," I'm going to show it to you somewhere else so you can see it."
"9781050","9781850"," Parked right here. "
"9783390","9784410"," 434, 24."
"9786310","9789830"," I'm actually bullish above here as long as we stay above this."
"9790990","9797090"," If you begin to get closed as below like here we will go down here and tag this one right"
"9797090","9797270"," here. "
"9798510","9801190"," We'll ping pong in here and then we'll move up right there."
"9802510","9803490"," Still bullish I believe it or not."
"9808410","9809930"," I'm actually very bullish right now. "
"9827790","9854650"," I'm on 435 So we've got"
"9854650","9884580"," 435 C's right now trading"
"9884580","9894410"," 434.50, 434.52 I'm going to"
"9894410","9897690"," take it off when we hit our one right here this cursor right here."
"9899350","9915940"," Trading 434.54. I'm"
"9915940","9917400"," about to take them off here in just a minute."
"9918520","9920200"," Trading 38 cents right now. "
"9924420","9925080"," I'm done."
"9926440","9929120"," They're trading 43 cents right now, 42 cents."
"9930660","9931700"," 41 cents. "
"9952390","9953910"," Big reversal bar there."
"9955630","9957410"," Tyler's trying to step in on that trade."
"9971310","9973070"," PT2 tag right there. "
"9984400","9988160"," 435.06 right I said 435.06 I think."
"10012340","10014460"," We're fucking Valhalla man."
"10015260","10016780"," Valhalla is right up here. "
"10018340","10019520"," That's fucking Valhalla."
"10024720","10028340"," You break above that motherfucker right there and we're going boomtown."
"10029300","10030780"," Like that one right there. "
"10031400","10035560"," If we get above that I'm going to fucking run over some sellers."
"10045910","10089600"," It's 435.06. Break"
"10089600","10090720"," above this shit like this."
"10100490","10102870"," It's like straight fucking moonshot right there. "
"10140840","10142980"," I think I'm going to put some shit tickets on here too."
"10145850","10146830"," I'm going to go with 436."
"10146830","10147110"," I'm going to go with 435. "
"10147350","10148590"," I'm going to 436."
"10150950","10152650"," I'm going to gamble."
"10191690","10192490"," Right here. "
"10192950","10194790"," Give me that fucking buy right there."
"10253590","10254390"," Did I get it out?"
"10254550","10255210"," Did I sell sofai?"
"10255370","10256470"," Yeah, I sold sofai."
"10257970","10260950"," I got stopped out yesterday and sofai made a penny. "
"10262690","10268510"," I didn't want to hold it into the bell even if it was going to continue to go up."
"10269950","10272250"," I don't like holding meme stocks."
"10273230","10274970"," I know you guys don't think it's a meme but it is. "
"10275870","10278810"," I don't like holding that well I should say this."
"10279770","10286090"," I like dip buying like sofai don't mind dip buying it where it was yesterday into the bell."
"10286550","10288890"," I was trying to get a squeeze up into the bell. "
"10289010","10289930"," That was the trade."
"10290590","10293230"," I was trying to try to squeeze up into the bell."
"10293250","10293810"," Didn't happen. "
"10297650","10299350"," So I like to buy it on low."
"10299590","10303770"," I don't mind buying sofai but there's a like buy and hold it."
"10303770","10305170"," I needed certain things to happen. "
"10305270","10305950"," Those didn't happen."
"10306850","10309810"," So I was just trying to try to squeeze into the bell yesterday on it."
"10311330","10315970"," I didn't want to get trapped in the overnight owning it. "
"10322430","10323670"," I didn't sell."
"10323830","10324510"," I got triggered out."
"10333980","10341820"," I don't dislike sofai either but I treat it like I treat GMEA and see that kind of stuff. "
"10346820","10352920"," That's something I can manage intraday but I don't want to hold it overnight."
"10356750","10358470"," I shouldn't say I wouldn't hold it."
"10358570","10364930"," I shouldn't compare it to GMEA and AMC it's not quite that kind of a ticker either. "
"10365470","10369070"," I shouldn't group it with it because they're not the same."

"13504350","13505650"," Just a couple heads up here."
"13506990","13511650"," So just for where we are, situation, awareness, that kind of stuff."
"13513470","13522030"," So we're at the, we're at where VIX bottoms, but there's a gap below VIX here too. "
"13523170","13532210"," There's a gap below that needs filled on VIX at $13.45. So currently we're trading $13.64, I think."
"13532210","13535550"," Uh, $13.64, I think."
"13535750","13540190"," Now there's a gap down below that needs filled at $13.46. Okay, so be aware of that. "

"13543090","13545050"," We're coming into the previous bottom on VIX."
"13545250","13548070"," So it's going to take a minute for the market to go up. "
"13550550","13553770"," Spooze is ripping our, our, our VIX, or excuse me."
"13554270","13556250"," Nasdaq is ripping some fucking faces off."
"13556430","13558170"," I'm sure you're all aware of that right now. "
"13560740","13563960"," Coming back up to close, it's gap above."
"13566740","13569100"," At $14,959, okay."
"13569780","13573400"," So as we get up here, it's going to be getting long in the tooth, right?"
"13574220","13578180"," So as we come up here, just be aware that it's going to get long in the tooth. "
"13578680","13580560"," At some point, there'll be a failure."
"13581560","13583420"," It'll be a failure, something like that."
"13584820","13588660"," And, uh, we've got VIX where I'm paying attention to the VIX here to see if we can get the"
"13588660","13589380"," VIX back down. "
"13589380","13591280"," Just be, be careful of this."
"13592220","13594300"," Don't change your trade and style, right?"
"13595060","13597100"," Take some money off as we get up here."
"13597940","13602400"," If there's a roll up here, there's a squeeze up, then back down. "
"13603400","13606180"," To buy this white line right here, right?"
"13606300","13608800"," It's just be thinking about the future up here."
"13610220","13611620"," Keep your eyes on the VIX."
"13611860","13613320"," Keep your eyes on Nasdaq. "
"13613780","13617380"," You know that you're going to get selling up here on this PT4 PT5."
"13618360","13621580"," I'm long right now, so I'm not a flat or anything."
"13621880","13625180"," I'm looking to get this at least close to this PT4. "
"13625820","13630940"," I think we get to PT5 as well, but just know this is your free ride right here, right?"
"13631460","13633500"," Valhalla, break above and hold."
"13633700","13635480"," Start running over sellers here."
"13638830","13642330"," Trade 94 cents right now in 435C. "
"13643090","13645590"," 100% trade right now."
"13647990","13651650"," Talked this morning and yesterday about buying 434."
"13652430","13655070"," Those were as cheap as 21 cents. "
"13655330","13668410"," Those are now trading $1.70. You"
"13668410","13672990"," could also possibly take like 75% of your trade off."
"13674090","13676830"," You can leave 25% on."
"13677470","13683070"," You can take off the entire trade and just go cheaper, right?"
"13683070","13688050"," You could buy a 20 cent call or a 50 cent call, something like that. "
"13688230","13693090"," Take some winnings off and look to go higher."
"13693490","13696070"," Now 81 cents on those 435s."
"13699950","13703210"," So make sure that you're managing your trades and the way up here. "
"13703370","13705650"," You actually hear water flame futures forward."
"13705810","13707990"," Make sure that you're managing your trades, right?"
"13708670","13711330"," Realizing profit, never a bad thing to do."
"13713130","13716210"," Never, never had a problem with anybody taking profit. "
"13722590","13726350"," Catching a bounce right now on the VIX on its bottom."
"13726730","13728970"," We're looking for a rejection at 1372."
"13729650","13731250"," See if it gets it or not. "
"13740890","13745030"," I don't want to see VIX break above 1372."
"13746010","13748750"," I want to see that VIX gets sold once again."
"13757910","13759850"," New high on IWM. "
"13761330","13763890"," NDX has a gap above it to close."
"13769910","13772870"," Actually two gaps, basically 15,000."
"13776690","13778930"," You'll hear bears claim double top. "
"13783120","13788440"," My trade right now is at 89 cents, 90 cents, bouncing around 93 cents."
"13789270","13792120"," I am still long here."
"13801630","13803710"," 91 cents right now. "
"13806890","13809130"," 93, 94 cents."

"13814030","13816490"," 90 fucking five cents right now. "
"13817370","13820950"," 96 cents, 98 cents, 97 cents."
"13832510","13834230"," 96 cents."
"13834230","13836590"," Now dollar haul or 435s. "
"13837230","13839630"," Trade in 50 cents, 15 minutes ago."
"13840130","13842770"," Dollar one, sell that fucking shit."
"13845070","13846550"," I'm flat right now. "
"13847990","13852310"," That was 100% trade, called out to you 15 minutes ago."
"13854510","13856370"," Trade in 435, 80."
"13857410","13859150"," For any of you bulls, I'm flat plate. "
"13859270","13862310"," If you want to leave 25% on, try to grab all this up here."
"13862310","13865410"," I understand, you want to grab that right there, I understand."
"13869090","13871230"," Leave a few on, grab some runners. "
"13872410","13875870"," So 436, 68, be really careful of 437."
"13876810","13878910"," They're only trading 12 cents right now."
"13879630","13882170"," If there's ever a roll, you're going to get caught in that trade. "
"13888130","13889590"," Fuck yeah, dude, I'm done, dude."
"13890150","13892490"," I can turn the fucking stream off right now, be honest with you."
"13896750","13898570"," Like, just turn the fucking stream off. "
"13898810","13899630"," I made my fucking money."
"13899950","13905790"," Happy fucking Fourth of July."
"13911830","13913610"," R243729, that's what you're looking for, right?"

"13925430","13925690"," It's Tuesday."
"13926290","13928930"," Fucking big fucking green this week."
"13939520","13944720"," Put that jam back on. "
"13985810","13987930"," Told you where we were going this morning."
"13989650","13991850"," Told you I wasn't selling my calls."
"14040520","14041780"," Hey, that was good. "
"14057940","14059360"," Yeah, I don't like that one either."
"14063200","14066480"," Thought I had some fucking free music on this thing that I uploaded."
"14067360","14068980"," So look at that music right now. "
"14071160","14071880"," Hold on."
"14072240","14073120"," What are you supposed to do?"
"14074080","14075680"," What was I supposed to do?"
"14077500","14079280"," I'm going to see this what I got here."
"14079820","14080940"," We got over there. "
"14081000","14081520"," We got over there."
"14082860","14083260"," Slipstream."
"14085800","14087080"," I don't want to do that. "
"14089780","14091000"," Hold on a second here."
"14101860","14102700"," Hold on here."
"14164080","14165360"," It's just one second out there. "
"14171960","14173500"," Let's see what's going on here in the background."
"14188270","14193010"," Now, supposedly I can play whatever I want."
"14193810","14195110"," I don't know if that's true. "
"14195790","14196830"," It says that I can."
"14206290","14209850"," The newest, most popular."
"14211990","14216070"," Yeah, I don't like that song. "
"14230030","14230910"," Kind of weird."
"14231050","14232790"," I got this like a new thing here."
"14233890","14234830"," Supposedly I'm not going to get. "
"14234970","14244790"," I better get hit with this, but I guess what I'll have to do is go through and see what's"
"14244790","14245530"," good and what's bad."
"14249410","14250550"," It's like Slipstream."
"14250610","14251890"," It's called or something like that. "
"14252390","14253890"," I don't know if it's any good or not."
"14254010","14256530"," I'm not really jamming with this right now, but I don't really."
"14256690","14257850"," I'm not really down with this. "
"14257850","14259070"," That's the streamer."
"14259250","14260570"," Safemode is on right now."
"14262670","14263530"," Let's see. "
"14264630","14265610"," Hip hop."
"14266350","14267810"," R&B, reggae, rock."
"14268710","14269350"," Strings. "
"14270310","14270790"," Holiday country."
"14274660","14281880"," It says newest, most downloaded, shortest, longest."
"14282980","14284140"," See what this is. "
"14285380","14295240"," I don't like that music"
"14295240","14295700"," either."
"14297760","14299300"," I don't like that one either."
"14309840","14311180"," I don't like that one. "
"14314850","14315750"," I love Lofi."
"14316730","14318250"," Hip hop, listen to that shit all the time."
"14323670","14325270"," Yeah, I don't know if I'm down with this thing. "
"14327890","14330190"," I can't see the multi stream right now."
"14337420","14339340"," Yeah, I'm not really down with this."
"14339400","14343880"," I guess I have to do some research or something and find out. "
"14344500","14348580"," I have to do some research down here and find out how to set this thing up."
"14348700","14350120"," I don't really like this music."
"14350300","14352480"," I just did most popular, most downloaded. "
"14353360","14354040"," I'm not a fan of it."
"14354980","14355480"," We'll find out."
"14355640","14356580"," It's called Slipstream. "
"14357680","14359560"," Maybe I can get someone to..."
"14359560","14362700"," Maybe I can find someone who won't look at it and see if he can get some good gems."
"14368640","14370560"," I don't know what the fuck is going on here."
"14374440","14376100"," It's like on in the background too. "
"14376440","14377340"," It's called Slipstream."
"14390030","14392530"," Put that back up for you guys so you can see it."
"14412200","14419200"," 4.35 is now traded $1.09. Maybe you took profit and bought some cheapies. "
"14420500","14439120"," Now trade $1.14. Now trade $1.15. It's"
"14439120","14440920"," like a part of the..."
"14440920","14442260"," I use Streamlabs."
"14443680","14450300"," And they claim that they have two music services where I won't get dinged for copyright."
"14451900","14455960"," But I think I have to write something in the video description. "
"14458160","14460800"," So I'll probably have to do something like that at some point."
"14462020","14468200"," There's a lot of scammers out there that'll try to claim the copyright on it so they can take money"
"14468200","14468920"," from your streams."
"14469780","14472340"," So they just blank it, go after streamers that play music. "
"14473520","14474520"," So the idea here would be this."
"14474920","14476240"," I would write a bot, right?"
"14477130","14483180"," And I would search videos for music even if it's copyright free."
"14485030","14489080"," And I would make a claim against every video out there. "
"14491340","14495200"," Now let's say out of 100 people 10 might fight it."
"14495760","14496920"," The other 90 will not."
"14497820","14502260"," So I get to claim all the money from the music in that video. "
"14502960","14504080"," It's kind of disgusting."
"14504360","14510280"," It's one of the really shitty parts about music on streaming or even recorded videos right now."
"14511120","14519740"," So if you use like a YouTube, if you do a YouTube video or YouTube in Twitch, the safest thing"
"14519740","14523880"," you can do is use actual free music from YouTube specifically. "
"14524740","14531540"," When you use an outside source, you have to cite that outside source in every video that you make."
"14533000","14538080"," Now even when you do that, there are still people running bots out there that don't care that"
"14538080","14538760"," you're citing them."
"14539360","14541860"," They will try to slam a copyright claim on you. "
"14542420","14547140"," And it doesn't matter if you only get 10 or 50 or 90."
"14548540","14553900"," From that point forward, if you win that claim and nobody fights you on it, you're going to forever"
"14553900","14558900"," have been perpetuity claim that music from that video."
"14558900","14561520"," It's a big scam that's run on videos right now. "
"14562100","14566640"," I got so angry about it at one point that I'm paying for this music."
"14567120","14570520"," I got so angry at one point that I just stopped playing music on stream."
"14571060","14574260"," I don't make any fucking money doing these videos. "
"14576700","14578160"," I don't make any money from YouTube."
"14578540","14579380"," I don't have sponsors."
"14580140","14581260"," I don't ask for them. "
"14581660","14583740"," I don't pump anything to you guys."
"14585460","14586900"," So there's none of that going on."
"14586900","14588660"," I don't sell a service to you yet. "
"14588760","14589960"," I'm doing that stuff to you."
"14591600","14595080"," So there's no like operation in the background making money."
"14595580","14600400"," So when I do lose the dollar or two, it's more like a, it's not really like, hey, I'm losing"
"14600400","14600880"," a dollar. "
"14601060","14605480"," It's more like, it's more like, it's like a, I don't, what would you call it?"
"14605580","14610820"," Like a, um, for the, uh, it's the, uh, what's it called?"
"14611080","14611540"," I forget what it's called."
"14611700","14617760"," It's like, um, it's for the, um, like, I didn't really need the money."
"14618000","14619480"," I just didn't like what they were doing. "
"14620720","14625820"," Yeah, it's the fucking principle of the matter."
"14627840","14629400"," It's the fucking principle of it."
"14633070","14634890"," It's just so fucking scummy, right?"
"14635850","14639430"," And, uh, you know, I don't buy fucking viewers, none of that shit. "
"14639590","14641190"," I don't do any of this shit you're supposed to do."
"14643130","14645330"," So I don't, I don't play those fucking games."
"14646270","14650290"," So, so the fact that you don't do that, and then everybody's out there trying to fuck you, like,"
"14650570","14654430"," bots and shit on YouTube, it's kind of fucking stupid. "
"14655550","14659150"," You're like basically forced into the game of, of becoming that person."
"14661250","14662270"," It's, it's everywhere."
"14662590","14666790"," It's like PayPal's that way, YouTube's that way, streamlabs is like that, Twitch is like that,"
"14666950","14667270"," doesn't matter. "
"14668270","14673730"," It's like all put, you're pushed directly into the fucking, uh, you have to be this certain thing."
"14674550","14681000"," Uh, that's just the, so I'll show you guys that."
"14682860","14684820"," So that's just financial juice right here. "
"14685560","14687960"," It says that on all their videos, you can play this at home."
"14688600","14691380"," It's a financial juice, so they don't sponsor me and nothing."
"14692280","14694200"," Just, I'm just playing their call outs here. "
"14696260","14698940"," Uh, they, uh, they sent me an email and said they would sponsor me."
"14699040","14699960"," I didn't, I didn't take sponsor."
"14701540","14704400"," Uh, they said they would sponsor me, I just didn't do it. "
"14704980","14705880"," You want to see that email?"
"14705880","14707120"," Maybe I can show that or something."
"14710690","14711350"," Let me see."
"14713370","14714390"," Let me find that one. "
"14720420","14722580"," I think they sent me something, an actual juice."
"14725260","14726860"," I don't know how long ago that was."
"14735730","14737410"," I never became an affiliate with them either. "
"14738150","14738570"," Let's see."
"14740870","14742430"," Yeah, so no affiliation with them."
"14744890","14745930"," Bring that one down. "
"14749430","14751010"," Did I talk to them at one point?"
"14751110","14751830"," I forget what it was said."
"14751990","14752550"," We see what they said."
"14762000","14762680"," Financial juice. "
"14762680","14763720"," Not seated here either."
"14765260","14766700"," Someone, oh, there it is right there."
"14771650","14781530"," It says, uh, it says, uh, here's a quick"
"14781530","14783550"," video explaining the first widget we have created. "
"14783550","14787430"," The dot will give you live audio, squat coverage, market, moving events."
"14788410","14791530"," It's, of course, delayed by 10 seconds video explainer."
"14792670","14794150"," Here, I'll get you guys a link to this. "
"14794150","14794910"," You guys want to see this?"
"14797770","14799150"," Probably shouldn't be showing this, huh?"
"14813720","14815060"," Let me show you guys this here."
"14818110","14820210"," So this is what they wanted me to play."
"14821050","14822290"," Should I make this public or no?"
"14824130","14833310"," I think it's a YouTube video. "
"14833310","14835330"," Let me put it posted here and see what it was."
"14835810","14836750"," It's like an explainer."
"14839070","14840250"," I'm playing it right now. "
"14840830","14841630"," Alright, I'm playing it."
"14841710","14842130"," It says launch."
"14843670","14844330"," Let's see what it does. "
"14848970","14850230"," It might not be active anymore."
"14850810","14856050"," Uh, I spoke to him last time I spoke to him was, uh, when did the last time I speak"
"14856050","14856410"," to him?"
"14861170","14863290"," Uh, March 22nd of 2023."
"14865150","14870530"," It says it's launching right now. "
"14871170","14873350"," It says, uh, voice player for financial juice."
"14876510","14877810"," I never signed up for it."
"14884290","14885490"," Yeah, I got it right here. "
"14885750","14886430"," Here you want to see it?"
"14887610","14889510"," Um, whoops, it's right here."
"14890170","14892250"," It's a financial juice, uh, voice player."
"14893570","14894510"," Uh, from them. "
"14895410","14896930"," They gave me a link to it."
"14896930","14898970"," Probably figure it out on your own."
"14903930","14905290"," It's not running right now. "
"14905970","14907290"," I don't know why it isn't."
"14907530","14909050"," Anyway, the guy was like, get back to me."
"14909770","14911490"," And I never got back to him. "
"14914170","14917330"," So I've got the stream on the background from financial juice."
"14917330","14918190"," That's a new squarcher."
"14918830","14923450"," When you hear him say something like, um, this is sponsored by financial juice. "
"14924410","14925090"," I have zero."
"14925970","14927450"," Zero connection with them."
"14928410","14929310"," Absolutely nothing. "
"14929970","14931150"," You can check with them if you want."
"14931290","14932250"," You can actually send them an email."
"14933330","14935770"," And ask them, and they'll tell you the same thing. "
"14938010","14941070"," Hang on R2 PT4."
"14941610","14942550"," Just tagged."
"14944150","14946830"," 436 16 within two points. "
"14948170","14954970"," Next target above 436 68 was asked this morning on the open."
"14954970","14956350"," Where do you think we're going?"
"14957330","14960490"," I told you 436 68."
"14963450","14964410"," There we go. "
"14974090","14974850"," Hey, you're welcome."
"14974950","14975630"," FX retracer."
"14978740","14979140"," Yeah. "
"14979240","14981540"," The guy's name is, uh, maybe some of you guys know this guy."
"14981680","14982660"," His name is a Marr."
"14982680","14984080"," I think a Marr or a mirror. "
"14985020","14985760"," Something like that."
"14986780","14988160"," It's A M A R."
"14988500","14989560"," That's why I spoke to it."
"14989660","14990200"," Financial juice. "
"14990200","14996730"," I think what they wanted."
"14997210","15001530"," They didn't say this in the email, but I think what happened for me was."
"15004090","15005670"," I could be wrong on this. "
"15006030","15009850"," Then this is this doesn't mean any ill will towards financial juice either."
"15009850","15010390"," I like them."
"15010670","15011850"," They do a great job. "
"15013310","15015270"," Uh, I think what it was."
"15016310","15017410"," They were trying to."
"15017990","15018990"," I could be wrong on this. "
"15018990","15026690"," It came off like they were trying to get streamers to play their stuff, but not pay them."
"15028410","15032950"," Like it was kind of pushed like I think publicly on Twitter."
"15033150","15036950"," I could be wrong on this, but it kind of looked like, Hey, look, we have a tool. "
"15037470","15038450"," You can use it."
"15038810","15040370"," We're not going to pay you to use it."
"15041230","15044090"," And I was like, eh, no. "
"15045730","15048950"," Like why be associated with somebody if they're not paying with paying you?"
"15049570","15052610"," So if I'm not associated with you, I can do whatever I want."
"15053530","15054390"," It was kind of weird."
"15055870","15056830"," Maybe they do pay. "
"15057750","15059330"," Uh, I didn't go that deep with it."
"15059410","15061250"," I was like, eh, like it's weird."
"15061470","15065630"," Like you kind of want to own all your own shit, your own content. "
"15065990","15067150"," Create your own content."
"15067810","15068230"," Own it."
"15068890","15069630"," Post it. "
"15070390","15072850"," Uh, and create something valuable."
"15073690","15077590"," Like the more that you sell out to people, the more you don't own your own shit."
"15078110","15082630"," Like when you're pumping like a fucking NFT or you're pumping a fucking crypto. "
"15083490","15085150"," And you're getting paid to pump it."
"15086350","15088270"," Uh, it's really sketchy."
"15089090","15092570"," Like there's something like, I get the people do it and why they do it. "
"15092690","15094590"," They would, they need to get paid for what they do."
"15095050","15096570"," So I understand why it's done."
"15097330","15099910"," Um, so one way or another, you have to get paid. "
"15101210","15105210"," It's too much time and energy costs, like this shit cost me fucking stupid money."
"15105990","15112470"," But, um, so I understand it or someone's like, oh, I want to continue to do this."
"15113070","15114910"," At some point you have to get paid for your time. "
"15115410","15116830"," Like something should be free."
"15117390","15121250"," Like if I'm just like hanging out on Finn Twitter or something or hanging out like Wall Street"
"15121250","15121550"," Bets."
"15122230","15123130"," I'm like I'm long here. "
"15123210","15123730"," I'm short there."
"15123850","15124450"," Something like that."
"15124610","15125210"," That's no big deal. "
"15125870","15128250"," Like if you decide not to do it one day, it's no big deal."
"15129290","15133550"," Um, but if you like providing quality shit, people can make money off of generally speaking."
"15134370","15136810"," Uh, regularly and people are expecting it out of you. "
"15136930","15138370"," You got to get fucking paid for that shit."
"15139010","15139570"," It's valuable."
"15140310","15144890"," Um, and it, it's time and energy and money and cost of doing business, all that shit. "
"15145710","15149990"," Um, so I understand people do it, but it's so fucked up to do it."
"15150030","15154310"," Like when you start to sell yourself out to other people, right?"
"15154310","15156250"," There's like different roads you can take."
"15156950","15164530"," You can like create your own shit, invest in yourself or you, uh, uh, fucking buy fucking followers"
"15164530","15168430"," and then you, like you get an F like a fucking, you get a fucking crypto scam. "
"15169110","15170730"," You know, and you like sell it to people."
"15171250","15172910"," That's like the wrong way to do shit."
"15173730","15176450"," So I don't, I don't do that stuff. "
"15182240","15185800"," Hell yeah, trading 436, 24 right now."
"15187040","15192140"," Uh, so you know, it's like that whole entire thing is like the path that you take."
"15192920","15201060"," I'm assuming too that some of it has to do with, um, like I need more, I need more, need"
"15201060","15201460"," more. "
"15201920","15203280"," I mean, I'm assuming that's what it is."
"15207830","15209290"," There's always fucking more."
"15210570","15217030"," Trading 436, 22, 436, 24, 436, 26, move it. "
"15217870","15219390"," Watch out for these sellers, man."
"15219610","15221990"," I'm gonna warn you guys as we come up to this target up here."
"15224310","15225290"," Remember that target?"
"15226430","15228090"," Remember I was showing you that down here?"
"15229230","15231030"," Remember when I said I bought the dip right here?"
"15232230","15233250"," Remember this target?"
"15235130","15240250"," So as we come up here, a little long in the tooth up there. "
"15240370","15240490"," Okay."
"15240530","15243250"," Just remember that you're going to start getting some sellers up here."
"15243930","15245910"," If you wanted to leave some runners on, that's fine. "
"15245990","15248370"," But just be, you know, take the fucking money and run, man."
"15248470","15249210"," Like get the money."
"15249850","15250550"," Bank it. "
"15250950","15251570"," How about this?"
"15251770","15252310"," I'll say this."
"15255030","15256490"," Like right where we are right now."
"15256570","15258750"," You think we're going up here in tagging PT five?"
"15259870","15260710"," How about this?"
"15262850","15263730"," Uh, 438s. "
"15264530","15265790"," They're 4 cents."
"15266210","15266890"," Uh, 437s."
"15267470","15268270"," They're 19 cents. "
"15269250","15273050"," Uh, 435s are now $1.32. You could exit."
"15273810","15274490"," Right?"
"15275030","15276210"," You're pocketing all that money."
"15276730","15278250"," You grab some 20 cent calls. "
"15279110","15283550"," You're still up $1.10. And you have a free fucking ride."
"15284850","15287870"," Paid for for free up to 436, 68."
"15290410","15292090"," Live to fight another day. "
"15292790","15294270"," Live to take another trade."
"15331190","15333370"," Let's see if we can buy one more long here."
"15333470","15335990"," Now it's 156 two o'clock in the afternoon. "
"15336070","15337490"," You know what happens on trend days."
"15338170","15339710"," We get that roll right."
"15340190","15341150"," Middle of the afternoon. "
"15341410","15341790"," Not always."
"15342950","15345630"," It's like, you know, it's 256 right now."
"15347590","15348870"," You know what happens, right?"
"15349070","15349590"," Not every time. "
"15349690","15351710"," Sometimes we keep continue to blast up."
"15351830","15352750"," We'll tag that our three."
"15353270","15354570"," That PT five. "
"15356650","15360390"," So just right now, just remember it's 156 in the afternoon."
"15361630","15364110"," Get that consolidation trade down in here."
"15365190","15366970"," Get that red line right there. "
"15367130","15367730"," You see it right here."
"15368090","15369090"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"15369470","15373250"," And then boom, we go up there and actually tag this or tag that right there. "
"15374430","15375930"," So let's look at it right now."
"15376070","15376190"," Okay."
"15377510","15379430"," How do we work on this trade?"
"15380150","15382450"," So I'm going to draw myself a box if I'm at home. "
