"125770","126510"," All the love today."
"128570","129509"," Live stream."
"133070","136830"," Okay, we're going to get some special S and P 500 love now. "
"137210","145790"," I hate doing these warnings because this is up or down doesn't matter because we're going to take a"
"145790","147470"," look at I think December."
"148650","152310"," And we're going to talk about I think December right around there."
"152390","153390"," We're going to talk about this morning. "
"154490","156630"," So I think that's it right there."
"157250","158330"," Risk off warning."
"159170","159650"," Okay. "
"160030","161090"," Good morning."
"161470","162110"," We're going to see."
"162190","163670"," I'm going to leave this post up here. "
"163850","168770"," If any of you are watching right now, if you could do me a solid this morning."
"170090","175130"," And repost that link to the live stream on your social media."
"175130","176090"," I would appreciate it. "
"177290","183190"," Just so it's hard for me between the discord, Twitter, YouTube."
"185050","190530"," Oftentimes people say, oh, they'll say things like you said this or you said that or whatever the"
"190530","191110"," fuck they say."
"191930","196090"," And mostly it's because they don't follow all different socials. "
"196850","197830"," No where I'm at."
"198030","198770"," You need like one."
"201550","205090"," One way to get information to people like experts. "
"206270","206810"," That's weird."
"207050","209750"," Like some people are like, you know, this or that or whatever."
"210050","211050"," I don't know how to explain that better. "
"211210","211290"," But."
"212810","218070"," Anyways, if you could read this specific live stream, if you could just repost it that way."
"218610","221190"," No one's like, hey, didn't say this or didn't say that or whatever. "
"221630","222670"," We have to talk about it."
"222750","222990"," It's important."
"223710","225290"," This is an important moment to the market. "
"226310","232330"," For you as a participant, even if you're a seller, there's a lot of important information you need"
"232330","232630"," to have."
"234330","237490"," For where we are and what's what's taking place this morning."
"237490","240630"," I'm going to try to get James Roland on today if I can as well. "
"240950","245190"," He said he was going to be on yesterday, but I wasn't able to get on to stream yesterday."
"246530","249190"," The night before I had a plane basketball got born."
"249550","253370"," Like I woke up yesterday morning and I couldn't go up down a flight of stairs. "
"253370","254810"," Like that's how fucked up I was."
"254810","256290"," And then I've got a daughter."
"256490","264450"," My wife and daughters came home yesterday, Tuesday, and then my oldest is sick. "
"264750","267430"," So just like dominoes falling that I couldn't get on to stream yesterday."
"268270","270130"," So I apologize to not being able to stream."
"270290","273270"," I thought I was going to be able to stream yesterday, but then just like the coffee. "
"273410","279170"," As a matter of fact today, because of one sick daughter and them just getting home, I have to go"
"279170","288450"," and do some other stuff at 4 p.m. These are just commitments to family and commitments to"
"288450","291750"," like it's hard to explain."
"292530","296870"," I thought things would get easier with kids as they got older and they're getting harder."
"297250","298450"," So whatever it's what it is. "
"299010","306430"," So we have to talk about the cross that took place this morning."
"306930","307810"," Give me one quick second here."
"307850","308330"," I'm going to turn it down. "
"308590","309690"," It's kind of hot here."
"309690","313410"," We're having this like late autumn harvest summer in Michigan."
"313630","313970"," It's awesome. "
"314270","315930"," That's why I was playing basketball the other night, too."
"316470","318850"," I played basketball till like 11 at night or something."
"319090","319510"," Maybe midnight. "
"319710","320150"," I'm not sure."
"320390","321490"," It was awesome, by the way."
"322090","324410"," And I got more of those events coming up, too. "
"324570","325590"," So take a more quick second."
"336760","338420"," Just went fast second there."
"340060","343540"," Okay, so let's get right into it. "
"343540","346300"," We're going to get into some more earnings today."
"346300","347560"," So don't be fearful."
"347600","348360"," We'll talk about it. "
"348500","349420"," Some earnings that are coming up."
"350100","355820"," And we're going to talk about the market at large and something that you must understand."
"356420","358940"," So I need everyone that's in this stream watching. "
"359660","362080"," Whether you agree or disagree to at least have an understanding."
"362500","367060"," Sometimes I'll say these things and we come back and people say, yeah, you said this."
"367820","369140"," And we're going to look at December. "
"370840","372600"," Let's see if we can look at December really quick."
"374640","377060"," I think 30 minute chart is fine for December."
"377600","378920"," We're going to look at December. "
"379720","380180"," Hold on here."
"380240","381860"," We're going to go to a full trigger screen."
"383500","384580"," I think it was December. "
"385400","386160"," Yeah, right down in here."
"388220","389100"," Right here."
"389560","390180"," I said December. "
"391460","394780"," Matter of fact, I think this is the December move right here."
"395000","395780"," I want to talk about two."
"396800","398960"," Two important timeframes. "
"401280","402480"," We can look at."
"403780","405460"," We can actually look at."
"406060","408560"," So this is December right here. "
"409440","410660"," This was actually it."
"410820","411900"," I think this was the big one."
"417330","418670"," This was the big one right here. "
"419890","421710"," I don't know if you guys remember that."
"425340","426320"," This one right here."
"426500","429040"," And then this one right here too is kind of big as well. "
"431520","433720"," Now we can look back over here."
"437410","438770"," We're going to talk about."
"440490","442030"," What is this right here?"
"442170","443310"," This is March. "
"444350","444830"," Right."
"445050","446010"," So let's start back here."
"446130","450890"," So I want to. "
"451350","454310"," It's easier to show this on a daily chart."
"455990","456990"," One day chart."
"457450","458850"," Let's look at the one day chart. "
"465660","467020"," There's a one day chart here."
"467120","467600"," We're going to look at."
"467600","470140"," I don't know if we should look at SPX maybe. "
"470780","471420"," Well, we can do it."
"471500","473060"," It's maybe it's better to show on SPX."
"485400","485940"," Okay. "
"488260","489340"," Right here."
"491340","496500"," Now let's look back in time here and whenever we break below, whatever price breaks below."
"497640","498480"," Or not price. "
"498780","499900"," Remember the daily trigger."
"501680","502220"," Crosses."
"504440","508320"," Remember the daily trigger crosses the monthly over here, right?"
"508980","509600"," Watch right here. "
"512360","519059"," Now we go into a to a risk off type scenario for major downside moves."
"519320","522419"," It's very, very dangerous in here when we break through this."
"522580","523660"," So if you're watching this. "
"524340","525300"," This cross."
"526820","527340"," Cross."
"527860","528700"," No, but that cross. "
"529440","530300"," That one right there."
"532120","537000"," That usually signifies high risk to the market for major downside to come."
"538540","539980"," Now we don't. "
"540000","540380"," It doesn't."
"540540","541940"," We don't always have follow through."
"542900","544840"," You can see this pull back up here. "
"545740","546700"," We got above right."
"547460","550900"," Bounced around started rocking off came back down a check it."
"551440","553260"," And they were off and running again. "
"553940","555480"," But you have to think about it."
"555520","555720"," Okay."
"556260","557560"," My point here being that. "
"559520","561200"," See you get the cross right here."
"561340","561960"," You see that cross."
"563040","566460"," See the first cross major moved down came back up. "
"567920","569140"," Across here, right?"
"569420","571400"," So this is a time for warning."
"572300","573020"," Not necessarily."
"573040","576360"," Hey, we're going to crash, but risk off warning. "
"576780","576900"," Okay."
"577400","579800"," So the other break is right here."
"580100","583000"," You're automatically in a risk off warning. "
"583280","586140"," Now if it resolves itself, everything is fine."
"586140","587520"," And you don't have to worry about it."
"587560","587760"," Okay. "
"588320","593560"," If we rejected to the downside, you would have been warned in case if you had more downside to"
"593560","593780"," come."
"594580","596760"," Does that does that example make sense to you at least?"
"597240","598580"," And then when we're over here."
"599460","601600"," I'm going to show you some other examples of this too. "
"602180","603640"," You get the big cross right here."
"603700","607180"," You get the big giant cross here and then a blood bath down."
"607660","608460"," Same thing over here. "
"608520","610740"," Blood bath down on the on the monthly trigger."
"611160","612140"," Same thing over here."
"612140","617420"," Major slam, slam, slam violent high volatility moves, right?"
"617620","619400"," And then you can also see it right in here, right?"
"619560","621360"," Like wam, wam, wam, wam, right?"
"621720","625420"," The risk off is the warning is taken off and we rocket ship to the upside. "
"625780","628680"," So this isn't to say because we're here."
"629580","633220"," This isn't to say that we're going to crash."
"633340","634580"," We're going to crash doom and gloom. "
"635420","640260"," But when you get the yellow line crossing that orange line, it leads to high volatility."
"640260","646540"," So when you're looking at this cross that's taking place right now, see that yellow line crossing"
"646540","647740"," the orange line over here?"
"648380","653020"," When this cross takes place, it triggers three things."
"653860","656960"," It triggers extreme volatility. "
"658700","662280"," It also triggers a risk off warning."
"662900","663980"," It needs to be confirmed."
"664860","667460"," So when we're down here trading this right here. "
"667460","668900"," Hold on here."
"670240","676660"," When this happens, right, what it leads to is volatility, major, major volatility."
"677700","683940"," And what the sellers are going to be looking for here is whatever this move is down, if it's to"
"683940","686860"," the monthly, if it's below the monthly, doesn't really matter. "
"687320","689900"," What really matters is the swing high."
"691060","697720"," If that gets rejected, it's going to lead to some some pretty big destruction in the marketplace."
"699560","701340"," So we have a risk off warning. "
"702120","703540"," It's not confirmed yet."
"704880","706580"," But you're going to be looking for it."
"706700","709640"," So I was talking to Joe this morning about it. "
"709880","710500"," Let me see if I can."
"712460","716960"," I'm going to write some stuff out here on the screen for you so that you, so this is clear"
"716960","717400"," as day."
"717520","717680"," Okay. "
"719500","720940"," This cross right here, right?"
"722960","724360"," So the cross."
"726600","727900"," Cross of daily trigger."
"730360","731900"," Below weekly trigger. "
"735660","737060"," Brings risk off warning."
"740800","745020"," The other thing that you need to understand about this though is it still will still need to be"
"745020","745480"," confirmed."
"755100","756500"," And if confirmed. "
"760240","761780"," You will likely be offered."
"765830","769450"," You will likely be offered an exit strategy."
"773980","775820"," We'll leave that up there like that. "
"776520","782280"," So cross of the DT below the WT brings risk off warning will still need to be confirmed."
"782280","785000"," If confirmed, you'll likely be offered an exit strategy."
"785000","786980"," And what this implies here. "
"788640","790480"," Is that none of this matters."
"791400","793340"," Okay, it's not going to go straight to the depths of hell."
"793380","794580"," What it's going to do, it's going to bounce. "
"795360","795660"," Right."
"795860","796900"," It's going to ricochet up."
"796920","802440"," So regardless of where that bounces, you would still need to confirm it here. "
"802560","803200"," Does that make sense?"
"806180","808240"," So you've got the move down over here, right?"
"808780","811940"," You've got you'll have a swing high and then a blast down below."
"812600","815100"," And then you get the rejections and all that kind of stuff."
"815660","816860"," Start pinning up here. "
"817740","820860"," Rejecting and we start looking for the next available level."
"821120","826400"," And that is going to be on SPX 347087."
"827580","828740"," So none of this is good. "
"828900","829600"," This is very unhealthy."
"830300","833860"," As a matter of fact, it's going to also matter how we close this week out."
"834700","836740"," Do you see, I want you to see this area. "
"836940","838260"," We see this orange line right here."
"838260","842900"," When we close this week out, you'll start to see the orange line head lower."
"843920","846500"," You'll see the daily trigger begin to race down next week. "
"847300","849940"," And we'll begin to make some violent moves up and down."
"850600","857140"," Now the caveat that I was talking to Joe about this morning to this would be the one caveat to"
"857140","864980"," this this morning that I wanted to leave Joe with was even with this alert of a risk off."
"865700","869040"," You're going to likely a high likely high probability. "
"870240","875170"," You'll likely be giving a chance to exit long or short."
"876060","878320"," Listen to me closely on this long or short."
"878580","883100"," So if you are a seller or a buyer, it's not going to really matter. "
"883440","888560"," What it does matter to you is that let's say you're short right now, right?"
"889340","892120"," And you're like, everything is awesome."
"892120","894060"," We're going to crash this, all this stuff."
"894200","898860"," And if the market turns on you and it starts to rip higher, you're likely going to see us come"
"898860","899860"," right back down again. "
"900440","905080"," If you're a bull and you're like, hey, I'm trying to buy this dip down here and you get caught"
"905080","905340"," in it."
"905340","907280"," You're likely going to see the market rip higher."
"908600","911960"," Let's say upside down or something, you're going to see it rip higher and give you a chance to make"
"911960","912400"," some money. "
"912680","915320"," So I guess maybe I'm describing that wrong."
"915980","921500"," Key point here is as this volatility will increase, you're going to be given chances if you're in"
"921500","921820"," the wrong."
"921820","923640"," To be in the right regardless. "
"924060","924520"," Does that make sense?"
"924960","927200"," So a long short doesn't matter."
"927660","933360"," You're going to see violence from this point forward and you're going to see some wild-ass moves."
"933940","939860"," If you are a seller, you're still waiting for that 430 rejection or even slightly higher. "
"940700","944980"," We could blast above that 430 and then still come back down and check 430."
"945520","949420"," If that check doesn't hold, that is the boom, exit the market, get the fuck on out."
"950300","951440"," Things are going to get violent. "
"951720","958120"," And we're going to go back to January of, we're going to go back to January here."
"960080","970000"," We're going to go back right here really quick to January of 2022 as a fine example"
"970000","970420"," of this."
"971060","975580"," So you've got the initial role here, right?"
"976040","977180"," Watch this cross right here. "
"977240","977720"," Do you see that?"
"978700","979520"," That's the cross."
"980900","982400"," Do you see how price?"
"983020","986020"," Do you see how price came back up to check it?"
"987680","988880"," Look closely here."
"991680","993500"," You get the bloodbath down, right?"
"995260","999860"," You get the squeeze back up over here and then the rip down. "
"1000540","1002620"," There's still a daily chart in Spy by the way."
"1003700","1010720"," Some more blood down here, but the key point is it's a giant liquidity grab right here."
"1011820","1014480"," But you still have the cross is still viable, right?"
"1014660","1015380"," On the yellow and orange. "
"1017080","1019040"," And that's where things got really nasty."
"1019280","1024740"," If you were in the market in January of my point that I'm trying to make to you here is"
"1024740","1029680"," if you're in the market long, I wasn't at this point."
"1029819","1036520"," But if you were along at this point in the market, the key point, the key driver would be that"
"1036520","1038900"," once this trigger started, right?"
"1038900","1039440"," Bam. "
"1039920","1045020"," Once that started and you're like, oh shit, I'm going to cut here, right?"
"1045480","1046980"," I'm going to cut panic cell."
"1047700","1052520"," There was still one more opportunity to exit the market actually near where you were before."
"1052740","1053200"," Do you see that?"
"1053700","1055060"," Like way back here in December. "
"1055360","1058520"," So if you're a bull, don't panic."
"1059680","1063480"," They can still resolve to the upside too, even though this went down."
"1064780","1069800"," Had price gone higher, you would have had an opportunity to reposition again to the upside. "
"1070200","1076640"," So the only key thing that you need to know here right now is that we are definitely risk off."
"1077440","1080040"," Definitely risk off waiting for confirmation."
"1081120","1084920"," Now, I do want to show you this December area here. "
"1085220","1089100"," I think this was December and we had the same kind of a situation over here."
"1089560","1091140"," We resolved to the upside."
"1091840","1092920"," Same thing over here. "
"1093140","1095060"," Hey, we're going to crash, resolve to the upside."
"1095480","1099360"," So what we can't, what you don't want to do is this."
"1101360","1110160"," What you don't want to do here is you don't want to panic cell this, right?"
"1111320","1115460"," You're like, oh shit, capsane, we're having a crash warning, right?"
"1115600","1120440"," You panic cell this, we squeeze way back up here, even higher. "
"1120440","1123540"," And you could have gotten that way up here."
"1123680","1124320"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"1124600","1126460"," Even if it's going to continue to the downside."
"1127600","1132060"," So don't be a seller here, be a seller up here. "
"1134560","1142240"," Yeah, you need to impress upon you the importance of where you are a seller."
"1142860","1143380"," Does that make sense?"
"1144060","1145280"," And also impress important."
"1145860","1151320"," Let's say if you're a bull wanting to sell right here, you should have been a seller here. "
"1151720","1156800"," If you were a bear and you were selling this, you still have that chance to come back down over"
"1156800","1159060"," here and not get caught down here."
"1159200","1159660"," Does that make sense?"
"1160540","1167340"," So just be, be, I guess the idea is the swings are going to be wild and whether it resolves"
"1167340","1168380"," to the upside or not."
"1168620","1171020"," Let's say you're like, I got, I'm short right here. "
"1171020","1177880"," You'll at least be given a chance over here with resolution to the upside to exit here rather than"
"1177880","1178300"," up here."
"1178420","1181800"," If you're a seller here, get squeezed up here, stay short until that happens."
"1182720","1185120"," So just don't be, just don't be the wrong time trying to sell. "
"1185460","1192560"," But anyway, right now, there is danger in the marketplace, absolutely 100%."
"1192560","1194120"," Have we broken trend?"
"1194880","1195660"," No, we have not."
"1196600","1201000"," If you check trend right here, you see this low right here?"
"1201000","1203260"," We still have not broken trend. "
"1203920","1205880"," So trend is still alive to the upside."
"1206480","1208300"," Bit bulls have hanging by a string."
"1209280","1212980"," But bears are definitely, see that blue line right here?"
"1213460","1216480"," Bears are definitely going to want to smash down into this. "
"1217200","1219520"," Create as much panic as possible in fear."
"1220420","1225560"," And then get that giant squeeze up for that continuation to the downside."
"1225560","1232560"," So just be aware of the mechanics of how this works itself out and what it can lead to. "
"1232600","1237220"," It can lead to some major, major downsides in the marketplace."
"1237920","1246640"," Do not ever take a cross of this yellow and orange line as, as meaning nothing."
"1246820","1247480"," It means a lot. "
"1247620","1252900"," It's a, it's a severe, uh, expect wild shit to come from this point forward."
"1252900","1259860"," So I need you to, I need you to at least understand that the, the, the power of that move"
"1259860","1263760"," can be seen today tomorrow."
"1263760","1265080"," Just this cross right here. "
"1265160","1266260"," It's a one minute chart right here."
"1266660","1270880"," Just this cross right here is extreme bearishness and extreme bearish is the marketplace."
"1271580","1272900"," Now, I don't know what's setting this off. "
"1274100","1276260"," I'm not, I'm not, not that I don't."
"1276320","1282620"," I'm assuming that it's front running, uh, an anticipation of an anticipation of the end of rate"
"1282620","1282860"," high."
"1282860","1287400"," Uh, so these banks are going to front run this shit early and they don't care. "
"1288020","1292140"," So whether, now if you're, I'm assuming you thought you're thinking that that process is going to"
"1292140","1294560"," take, uh, one month, right?"
"1295220","1299580"," If you're a seller or a barrier, probably like, hey, we're going to crash today or this week."
"1300060","1303840"," And we're going to restart the market because I'm positioned short."
"1304320","1308060"," The process should take, uh, into at least springtime. "
"1308060","1311820"," To take from now into, so then what are we in right now?"
"1311900","1314100"," We're in November, basically, right?"
"1314620","1318800"," So next two months and then another three months, that's five months of downside action."
"1318980","1323580"," It's going to take, but you need to, at this point, be prepared for that downside action."
"1324340","1327240"," And to be selling any and all rips at this point. "
"1327460","1330820"," So if I were to say, Hey, Captain, you have a bear suit on today."
"1331600","1333420"," Uh, I don't, but I will."
"1333420","1338740"," Um, so my, my bear suit will come on above at that 430, 440 area. "
"1339020","1341540"," If we can roll that back down, it's going to become sell the market."
"1342000","1347500"," Um, so the bear suit is, uh, standing by, I should say it's not like I'm not wearing it right"
"1347500","1351060"," now, but I'm going to be wearing it here very soon."
"1351420","1354120"," Uh, next month or two, you're going to see the full bear come out. "
"1354340","1356840"," So be conscious of it."
"1357200","1364500"," Uh, when it's happening, when it went back when we were streaming back in, um, September, October,"
"1364660","1366020"," November of 2021."
"1367800","1370780"," And I was telling people, Hey, this is the time to get out, right?"
"1371120","1375260"," Uh, and now start to get out of Apple, all the big ones that the banks were supporting with"
"1375260","1376080"," corporate debt bonds. "
"1376920","1379940"," Um, I was like, Hey, some of this might get held up and it did."
"1380000","1382660"," It kept, it kept squeezing up into the beginning of the year."
"1383280","1388580"," But then we finally got that role in January and we got the confirmation heading into, I believe,"
"1388720","1390340"," April or March or something like that. "
"1390340","1392120"," And then the, the real selling started."
"1392680","1398000"," So, um, this, this should be a process should be two, three, four, five months."
"1398520","1403040"," Anyone out there that tells you like, Hey, crash today, black Monday, that stuff is wrong. "
"1403940","1405240"," Um, they are wrong."
"1405400","1406380"," It's normally takes time."
"1407120","1411500"," Even in, uh, COVID being like a major moment in the market. "
"1411800","1415360"," We still had major squeezing that took place for those confirmations."
"1415780","1420600"," That big role that happened in COVID where we're still giant squeezes up and then we confirmed it"
"1420600","1421320"," to roll over."
"1421620","1423920"," I'm not going to expect a COVID type of role. "
"1424220","1427700"," You know, there's no, there's no reason for there to be that kind of a crash."
"1428280","1432820"," Uh, fundamentally or technically, uh, but be aware of it."
"1432980","1433280"," Okay. "
"1433520","1437400"," So if you're a market participant, if you're a bull out there, right, I need you to, I'm what you"
"1437400","1438080"," guys know, I'm a bull."
"1438760","1444680"," I need you to know that you are, you are being set up right now for confirmation."
"1445920","1454320"," Um, you're being set up right now for confirmation of the market to crash into February, April of"
"1454320","1454840"," next year. "
"1455160","1456240"," Now it could take even longer."
"1456420","1457580"," It could take the entire year."
"1458200","1466920"," Believe it or not, but, um, you're, you're, if you're a bull, you're only thing that you're doing"
"1466920","1470820"," at this point is looking to sell for 3440, something like that. "
"1471040","1471940"," You're looking for that."
"1472360","1478040"," If you don't see the will from buyers to step in up there and reverse it to the upside, you"
"1478040","1478520"," are not a buyer."
"1478700","1480800"," You're risk off at this point with cash in the market. "
"1481400","1485970"," Um, let me see here."
"1487110","1491850"," So you've got, you basically have the, how do I explain this?"
"1492090","1496870"," So, like, so you have it, like if you're a seller, you have the potential to have an extension to"
"1496870","1497210"," the downside."
"1497450","1499110"," I've got this gray box over here. "
"1499170","1504890"," You've got an extension possibility down to 406.59ish somewhere in there."
"1506270","1509650"," Um, an extension of the downside right now."
"1509690","1510690"," You likely don't get it. "
"1510690","1511870"," It's really overextended."
"1512310","1517490"," Uh, but if you're a seller, you're biggest thing here, like the thing that you need to like."
"1518350","1521010"," Well, here's a piece of advice to you. "
"1521090","1524990"," If you're a bear, you're a, you're a, you're a bear."
"1525150","1526350"," Bears, you know, I don't dislike you."
"1526550","1531610"," I know people come off saying cap doesn't like sellers or cap's always a bull, but if you're a"
"1531610","1534610"," seller, you know that I don't dislike you at all. "
"1534610","1536470"," You know that I tell you exactly what you're looking for."
"1536690","1541910"," If you're a seller, you want, you're at this point regardless of price where we are right now,"
"1541910","1545050"," you're looking for that confirmation."
"1545050","1550930"," It is key for you to get that confirmation on it is key for you to get that confirmation on. "
"1551170","1552450"," It is key for you to get that."
"1552930","1554210"," You're going to say no way cap."
"1554410","1554950"," I don't want that. "
"1555330","1557730"," But let's talk real truth trading here."
"1558230","1564930"," You need the squeeze back up and then the rejection and that what that's doing is confirming to you"
"1564930","1565210"," that."
"1566810","1571530"," It's confirming to you that we're going to have a, we're going to have a, that we're going to have"
"1571530","1572110"," a liquidation. "
"1573030","1578370"," On a much higher timeframe on a one year, believe it or not time frame of accumulation."
"1579290","1585270"," So we're going to go from a accumulation to not consolidation, but distribution on a one year"
"1585270","1585690"," timeframe."
"1585870","1586150"," Okay. "
"1587550","1588530"," And so you're looking."
"1588790","1589790"," So that's your thing."
"1590010","1590590"," You're a seller. "
"1591030","1595130"," Don't be drinking the fucking Kool-Aid out there and being like, yeah, you know, my friends are"
"1595130","1598350"," telling me crash, you know, black Monday crash today or black Friday crash."
"1598350","1599710"," And that kind of nonsense."
"1600290","1601710"," Don't be listening to that shit out there. "
"1601790","1603510"," Stop drinking the fucking social media Kool-Aid."
"1604330","1605910"," You need that confirmation."
"1606750","1610050"," And so when you see it, if you see it in the next few weeks or the next four weeks,"
"1610050","1613830"," that rejection up there at 434 40 something like that. "
"1614030","1620290"," You see the buyers don't have, you see the squeeze and then you see that the buyers don't have the"
"1620290","1624110"," sentiments or the will to want to buy the market."
"1624110","1633010"," You're likely going to see that market reject there and begin a steady decline over the coming"
"1633010","1636450"," five months at minimum."
"1636610","1638190"," It should take until about April. "
"1638490","1640770"," So though it's that four months and then two more."
"1640930","1643370"," So I said five, well, let's do it six months."
"1643630","1647830"," It should take about six months, three to six months somewhere in there, depending upon when the"
"1647830","1649410"," panic really begins. "
"1650430","1652290"," You won't see panic today either."
"1652530","1657950"," I don't want you to think by this warning that you'll see like true panic today, but the true panic"
"1657950","1661290"," will kick in as that 434 40 rejects."
"1661730","1664730"," You'll then see the selling go below the monthly trigger. "
"1665310","1671490"," And that's when you're going to start triggering long only funds to begin to hedge massively."
"1671490","1678690"," That and that creates the waterfall puts that creates the force selling by major institutions."
"1679630","1684270"," And you will see that you will see that cascading downside waterfall. "
"1685350","1688990"," So we failed to get a new high on the year right on 2022."
"1688990","1690650"," We failed to get the new high this year."
"1691710","1696590"," We are now starting to have or we have the official cross of the daily trigger over the weekly"
"1696590","1699290"," trigger that that triggers the warning immediately. "
"1699870","1705810"," And now we're just waiting for that confirmation for liquidity grab from the upside to begin to"
"1705810","1708210"," make those down that staircase move down."
"1708830","1717670"," Now, if you're looking if you want to like pre pre game that if you're looking to pre game that"
"1717670","1720110"," right now or what are those targets in the springtime."
"1720970","1722730"," I can give them to you right now. "
"1722830","1729570"," I can give you the actual numbers as of right now they change over time, but I can give them"
"1729570","1736730"," to you with some kind of their expectation of where we're going to go from historical examples"
"1736730","1738490"," going only back to 1890 with the tool."
"1738890","1742650"," So if you have access to the tool, you can already see these things."
"1745210","1753590"," If you if you feel like you if you feel like you if you feel like you are missing out"
"1753590","1757570"," or something or you missed the you missed this move down. "
"1757570","1758830"," You have not missed it."
"1758990","1760990"," There's so much more down to go."
"1761710","1764150"," And we're going to talk about something else here too. "
"1765030","1771150"," So if the bears get their confirmation right if a seller gets their confirmation up here we begin"
"1771150","1771990"," to head lower."
"1773050","1776870"," If they get that confirmation you are guaranteed to see."
"1778070","1784030"," You are guaranteed at minimum to see a retest of this prior low from October I believe 12. "
"1784810","1785530"," That will be."
"1786430","1788290"," 34 96 65."
"1789410","1794770"," Historically if and not only historically but if you look at a white golf type stuff if you guys"
"1794770","1801050"," are or understand white golf in any way shape or form this failure of the new high up here. "
"1802830","1810570"," And this retest down below has a high probability of breaking below even lower."
"1810570","1815350"," So had you got had we had both gotten the new high and failed."
"1815670","1820070"," There would be a low probability of breaking this prior low from October. "
"1820250","1821570"," Does that make sense to you."
"1821810","1826670"," So have we gotten the new high from 2022 we traded up here."
"1827270","1832750"," You would have had a high probability of retesting this at most and then get and go. "
"1833550","1839110"," The failure to get the new high signals that not only will you test this."
"1840050","1843950"," Here but you will likely break below it at some point even if we squeeze for liquidity."
"1844830","1848230"," And retest and even lower low now currently that's at. "
"1849630","1851390"," 28 14 in the quarter."
"1851870","1855890"," But if you figure if we were to hit this by if we were to hit this by a Q"
"1855890","1857290"," two of."
"1858310","1858870"," 2024. "
"1861700","1866660"," 26 18 200 points that would put a target of springtime of 3000."
"1868440","1870400"," So let's call April."
"1870400","1872700"," A target of. "
"1873160","1874740"," Right about here."
"1876540","1879540"," Right about there is going to be a target for April."
"1880980","1882360"," Right around 3000. "
"1882960","1887420"," So by April 30th something like that if this conference we get a confirmation of."
"1887660","1890140"," We get this confirmation up here that we're going to begin rolling."
"1890740","1891900"," You should expect. "
"1893280","1896700"," 3000 now that doesn't mean hey caps that I buy like put."
"1897140","1902100"," Puts here for 3000 fuck no you buy them on the confirmation above."
"1902540","1904300"," If we start to roll that three. "
"1904680","1909060"," If we start to if we start to reject this up here and confirm that move down lower."
"1909460","1910340"," Up here."
"1911120","1915480"," Fuck yeah you put the 3000 you know or 3500 or something. "
"1915480","1921600"," With a with a like 3500 with a target of 3000 in April."
"1922200","1926260"," To the downside and the bears will have the greater."
"1927400","1932100"," Probability of not only you're getting a major test of this but then you're going to still likely"
"1932100","1932800"," roll down. "
"1933300","1937640"," And get 3000 so bears congratulations if you're a seller congratulations."
"1938860","1942080"," You're you're 90% of the way."
"1943080","1945320"," You're 90% of the way towards. "
"1946540","1949280"," Towards that major role and not only that."
"1949880","1952200"," If polls were looking for."
"1953020","1955260"," If polls were looking for. "
"1957120","1961700"," The polls like myself because I was and am."
"1962140","1967920"," Looking for the low to be just a recheck of."
"1968820","1973020"," 3500 at worst right like we don't go back and visit a new low in the market. "
"1973880","1979160"," We're going back to visit 3500 no big deal I can accept that but right now."
"1979900","1982540"," We're not setting that up right now we're setting up."
"1983220","1989480"," A new low below 3500 so there's probably two things that you need to know. "
"1989980","1990620"," Number one."
"1991540","1993360"," We are in a risk off warning."
"1993360","1997460"," You need a confirmation though above it for 3440. "
"1997820","2000720"," So those are the two number one and number two right number three."
"2001140","2005160"," Due to not regaining a new high of some point this year."
"2005920","2007360"," You are going to be looking for. "
"2007780","2011460"," A new low at this point not 3500 but likely 3000."
"2012460","2015320"," Whereas you probably weren't looking for a new low."
"2015980","2017940"," If you had if the market had. "
"2020120","2022900"," Attained a new high on the year."
"2025120","2025980"," Thanks appreciate."
"2027780","2030500"," Can we get back to 417 today likely no. "
"2032800","2035540"," Not only likely no but we are still underneath."
"2035840","2036700"," So this is a one minute trigger."
"2037040","2038940"," Here's a woman time frame and spy right now. "
"2039540","2044500"," I have an expectation that we will go down unless unless we're going to go down and test that 41."
"2045260","2045920"," Spy real quick."
"2050830","2052210"," We get spy up here. "
"2055590","2058449"," So you're parked right now on s2."
"2060650","2063570"," Here is s1 unless we begin to see a reversal."
"2065750","2069130"," Absolutely expect a tag of 41035 today. "
"2070909","2076250"," Absolutely expect a tag of 41035 and you're going to see shit get wild out there."
"2079110","2080750"," Absolutely wild price action."
"2080969","2083310"," So we put this down here. "
"2084250","2087090"," You're looking to see this get tagged today."
"2089900","2090920"," Good morning by the way."
"2091000","2091820"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"2091940","2093080"," How's it how y'all doing out there?"
"2093120","2093639"," Everybody doing well. "
"2098660","2099920"," Put this up here."
"2104570","2105950"," Give me a couple seconds here."
"2106050","2115410"," First I'm going to try to read the chat here in just a minute. "
"2115410","2116750"," Today it's kind of off the cuff."
"2117650","2119550"," Give me one quick second here."
"2126530","2130950"," If you want to come on today. "
"2138370","2139050"," Let me know."
"2144590","2147570"," There's that that blue is going to be your target to the downside."
"2148610","2154350"," I don't know where the S3 is down at 41082. "
"2157170","2159490"," 41082 but you're likely going to see."
"2160170","2161190"," Here's S3."
"2167940","2173140"," Yeah, so it's just that just above is where S3 on this chart is right here. "
"2174540","2178840"," Make that one white."
"2194190","2195130"," Where is that?"
"2195130","2197570"," I don't know what just happened there."
"2202930","2203530"," S3 baby. "
"2210570","2211970"," Now with all that doom and gloom."
"2212690","2214070"," With all that doom and gloom."
"2214350","2215790"," What I don't want you to do. "
"2216790","2218250"," What I do not want to do."
"2218310","2220870"," If you come on this, come on my chat at some point and go on Twitter."
"2221950","2223070"," And it resolves itself. "
"2223470","2225490"," Don't come back and be like, Hey, cap, you called for a crash."
"2226190","2227390"," Don't be like a company called for crash."
"2228150","2228950"," It resolved. "
"2228970","2229670"," Went to the upside."
"2229950","2231090"," You're such a fucking bear."
"2231230","2232290"," Don't be doing that shit to me. "
"2233230","2236890"," When you guys do that stuff to me, I'm always like, I'm either like, they're either not watching"
"2236890","2241550"," the show or they're just watching Twitter or they're just in the discord or they're not like"
"2241550","2243190"," consuming all of it at the same time."
"2244730","2253390"," So if it does resolve itself, bulls carry on, but I'm telling you, if you're a bull out there, that"
"2253390","2254250"," cross, right?"
"2255190","2260390"," Is bad news like it is as bad as can be."
"2260830","2261810"," And it really is. "
"2262090","2267250"," And what else is crazy about this is price doesn't really matter in this."
"2267810","2271950"," Price could have came down to 410 without that cross above."
"2272730","2274390"," And it would not have mattered. "
"2274750","2281630"," But because we got the cross with price, that is usually like red flags flying everywhere alarm"
"2281630","2282490"," bells going off."
"2282970","2284430"," Joe donut this morning tool."
"2284630","2285650"," So I called Joe this morning. "
"2285910","2287450"," It wasn't a phone with him this morning before I came on."
"2288190","2291750"," And I hadn't seen the cross yet as of this morning."
"2292010","2295130"," So I got all kinds of crap I got to do in the morning, but right now I'm doing much"
"2295130","2295370"," crap. "
"2295550","2300290"," But I get back on to or I get back out of the screens this morning and I'm talking to"
"2300290","2302570"," Joe and I hadn't noticed yet."
"2302630","2307330"," And I'm like, shit, we got a cross of the daily trigger and the weekly trigger today and spy."
"2307610","2308390"," I don't really care about. "
"2308550","2312470"," But SPX is what I care about."
"2312470","2317450"," The cross on SPX is very, very dangerous."
"2319090","2320690"," Joe's like, I already made a post about it. "
"2320750","2321750"," I'm like, oh, shoot."
"2322310","2325330"," I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm going to post myself."
"2325610","2325930"," Oh, yeah. "
"2326370","2328690"," And those are the things that we're watching for."
"2328850","2332150"," So those are the things that I'm always watching for."
"2332270","2335710"," If you like thread the eye of the needle with price and get it back up above and you start"
"2335710","2336570"," closing out days. "
"2337470","2338670"," And then you close out a week bullish."
"2339610","2341490"," Not a bad thing price going down there."
"2341490","2341950"," No cross. "
"2342190","2348470"," Not a bad thing price going down there and you get that cross warning bells warning bells warning"
"2348470","2350930"," bells hundred fucking percent."
"2353050","2354690"," Oh, yeah, the squeeze could be insane."
"2355150","2356610"," We'll talk about the rest of earnings too. "
"2358010","2359370"," You know, it's kind of weird too."
"2359790","2360890"," Let's look back on."
"2361150","2364350"," Let's look back on where I left you on Tuesday. "
"2364410","2364890"," Right."
"2365690","2368010"," So on Tuesday night when I left you guys."
"2369030","2371630"," I left you guys on Tuesday night. "
"2372410","2378050"," We were parked on top of the hourly trigger to trade the hourly trigger up to the weekly and daily."
"2378670","2384310"," And we were looking for a confirmation back test for the bulls on an hourly trend reversal to the"
"2384310","2384710"," upside."
"2385350","2389510"," And they didn't get that on the open on Wednesday. "
"2389950","2395510"," They didn't get that that that counter trend to the upside move confirmation trade."
"2395510","2399350"," We began to actually sell the hourly trigger into yesterday."
"2400110","2404270"," That selling on that hourly trigger of course leads to this downside move that you're seeing right"
"2404270","2404530"," now. "
"2405670","2408410"," And we're likely going to see that once again too."
"2408670","2408810"," So."
"2410790","2417010"," So that target is right up here at four eighteen fourteen and they're selling the half hour trigger"
"2417010","2417730"," right now too. "
"2417830","2418230"," Do you see it?"
"2418850","2419330"," Sellers here."
"2419530","2420410"," Sellers right here."
"2421890","2426290"," And you're going to want to check to see if sellers get back in on that action again here and"
"2426290","2426630"," here. "
"2426850","2428070"," And that matter of fact on Tuesday."
"2429210","2430650"," We'll talk about that stuff too."
"2430850","2431690"," Like the meta thing. "
"2433050","2434730"," We'll talk about meta at some point."
"2435190","2435450"," I'm still."
"2435630","2436770"," Do I got to tell you guys a secret?"
"2437410","2438370"," So you got. "
"2438570","2439630"," I sold fucking Verizon."
"2439990","2440510"," I sold Visa."
"2440910","2442550"," I sold all my calls on Tuesday at the close. "
"2443330","2446730"," Even my weekly is ending to close now before the bell on Tuesday."
"2447390","2450670"," And I'm so fucking ecstatic that I didn't get caught in that shit yesterday."
"2450670","2451730"," And I'm so ecstatic. "
"2452490","2453790"," That I closed like all these."
"2453990","2455270"," Like I'll as all these."
"2455850","2459070"," Like I was all these DIA tickers report. "
"2459550","2460750"," I'm just like take the money and get out."
"2460930","2461670"," Take the money and get out."
"2461870","2462650"," Take the money and get out. "
"2462890","2463630"," Take the money and get out."
"2464750","2466590"," So I'm like kind of stoked on that shit."
"2469230","2472050"," So like if you have under I want to tell you guys something. "
"2472990","2476510"," If you own underlying into this earning season."
"2477470","2482130"," You are being given the opportunity and all these underlying tickers to exit the market."
"2482630","2487750"," If you watch the things that I'm doing right now for all of my holdings on the market like actual"
"2487750","2488970"," fucking stock. "
"2489730","2495130"," I am exiting every they're all printing every single one of them is printing and I'm getting the"
"2495130","2495550"," fuck out."
"2495550","2495930"," So."
"2497650","2499350"," I don't have to say to you. "
"2499590","2505950"," There's a there's an exit going on in the marketplace right now by a lot of people that own the"
"2505950","2506350"," market."
"2506990","2508970"," And even these earnings are like."
"2510050","2512630"," I'm like fuck that I'm out like I'm making money. "
"2512830","2514390"," Get out of get out of these are done."
"2514430","2515010"," See you later."
"2533500","2535860"," Yeah, so we're going to go but we're going to get back into earnings. "
"2536240","2538300"," What the rest of the earnings for this week."
"2538720","2542340"," If you are along this market in any way shape or form."
"2543480","2545240"," I if you don't already know. "
"2546400","2548860"," I've been very forthcoming on."
"2549760","2550860"," Hey, this one's hit."
"2551000","2551480"," Let's get out. "
"2551720","2552440"," Hey, this one's it."
"2552620","2553080"," Let's get out."
"2553300","2558240"," So if you are long and you have earnings coming up for your favorite ticker and it hits. "
"2558240","2562200"," It's the money and you're in the green fucking ex get the fuck on out."
"2564260","2570000"," I like Verizon Tyson foods Budweiser visa."
"2571000","2575480"," So I so whenever we hit it like all these companies throughout this year that went. "
"2575780","2579720"," So while Dow Jones industrial average is going into the fucking dumps for the past couple of"
"2579720","2580020"," months."
"2580800","2585700"," I was buying those bottoms and trying to like I was like I'm going to buy them for my kids."
"2586620","2588740"," I'm like I'm going to buy for my kids at home with five 10 years. "
"2588920","2593080"," Then I get started getting panicky and I'm like well maybe they're going to reprice some of these"
"2593080","2593620"," tickers."
"2594380","2596540"," So all these tickers are printing right now."
"2596720","2599620"," Like all these Dow Jones tickers are mooning right now. "
"2599960","2602580"," I don't know if you're noticing those mechanics in the background but it's happening."
"2604520","2605500"," Let me see here."
"2608240","2610460"," Yeah, so I've got a lot of money in that. "
"2610620","2613180"," I've got my money in brokerages making five percent."
"2613180","2620520"," I saw some people come on the show saying that they were going to fucking long bonds for like a"
"2620520","2623160"," year two years two months all kinds of shit."
"2623300","2626900"," I'm like I don't want to put my money into anything that I can't pull it out. "
"2627060","2629520"," Like I can get five percent and have access to it today."
"2629700","2637320"," So if I ever want to move the money I can I don't have to like stay in."
"2637760","2640800"," I'm not going that direction personally. "
"2640800","2645580"," And to be honest to chase that five percent for me is not viable."
"2646480","2651660"," You know what else is funny too is the GDP numbers that came out this morning."
"2652460","2654840"," Man I'm looking at those GDP numbers. "
"2655220","2658940"," I haven't read any of social media and what they think about GDP numbers."
"2659980","2660500"," None."
"2660800","2661440"," I haven't read anything. "
"2661820","2668140"," I'm sure that I'm going to I'm going to think a wild ass guess here and assume that people are"
"2668140","2671900"," saying well GDP here the feds going to have a tight even more."
"2672120","2676780"," I'm assuming that you read that that that discussion."
"2676780","2678400"," I don't agree with that. "
"2679380","2682160"," That GDP number is to me."
"2682920","2685660"," A lot of what we've been talking about with."
"2687620","2692840"," Wage price inflation that you're not being told by the fed. "
"2693640","2701860"," And also so wage price inflation basically from the fed and then the the"
"2701860","2706020"," inflation never going away narrative."
"2707060","2710260"," Now they can claim into next year that they beat inflation."
"2710780","2714800"," They can fudge the numbers all they want to say hey we got inflation below two percent. "
"2715400","2722820"," But GDP is disagreeing with that."
"2722820","2727460"," The price gouging and the re pricing of your hamburger for McDonald's."
"2727900","2731760"," That companies are making money by increasing prices. "
"2732960","2739820"," And also that people are making more money than they ever were before to pay those prices."
"2740600","2746040"," So when you're seeing those mechanics with I'm seeing those mechanics within the GDP numbers."
"2747320","2748740"," It's very worrisome. "
"2749520","2757620"," It's very it's very worrisome in terms of the wage price and play our spiral and inflation staying"
"2757620","2758340"," here forever."
"2759600","2761640"," Now that's not necessarily bad for the market."
"2761740","2766180"," I think in the long term it works out better for the market market will go higher and higher due"
"2766180","2767360"," to the cheapness of money. "
"2767800","2773460"," But but it's telling you that there's now cheapness of money being built into our system."
"2773460","2776500"," So when you're seeing the GDP numbers this morning."
"2777660","2781840"," I wouldn't like the topically you're likely going to hear people out there saying to you. "
"2782120","2784960"," Things like well that means the Fed has more work to do."
"2785360","2789780"," Don't buy that fucking don't buy that that that that parge don't be eating that porridge."
"2790220","2793680"," It's really telling you that the Fed is going to fucking fail. "
"2794200","2799600"," That's what it's telling you that is failing in the Fed is going to fail in the future."
"2800100","2802180"," That when we look back I want you to know something."
"2802180","2803720"," When we look back in four or five years. "
"2804380","2806740"," You're not going to see price prices coming down."
"2807360","2811000"," You likely won't you will still likely see the roll down."
"2811440","2820640"," That's a normal function of our stock market but our economy will likely go up in wages and will"
"2820640","2823880"," likely go up in the price of goods and services permanently. "
"2824800","2825720"," So just be aware of that."
"2825800","2826740"," These are two different functions."
"2827000","2829080"," This is a function of the market and a function of the economy. "
"2830920","2837360"," Those GDP numbers do not bode well for your price of goods and your pay."
"2837980","2841140"," If you're out there and you've got a job and you're not beating inflation right now."
"2842080","2844180"," Start looking for high paying jobs. "
"2844440","2847280"," If you hadn't done it in the past year or two and everyone told you to do it."
"2847880","2849260"," You better fucking do it."
"2849460","2851260"," That GDP number is telling you. "
"2851500","2853680"," It is screaming in your face right now."
"2855600","2860540"," That prices have gone up and people are willing or able to pay those prices."
"2860940","2866400"," And it's likely going to become sticky in the next four or five years and eat like so. "
"2866620","2874760"," Even though even though wage wage data is saying no or it's not so bad right now."
"2875540","2877040"," That's the fudging of numbers."
"2877660","2881900"," I assure you that you need to get ahead and get that job that pays. "
"2883340","2887400"," So you can beat that inflation that's coming down the pike."
"2887860","2889740"," And other people are doing it is my point."
"2890020","2891920"," There are other there's unions out there doing it. "
"2892060","2892320"," There's."
"2894840","2896540"," They're like people are doing it."
"2896720","2899480"," So you might not be you might be working a job where they're going to. "
"2899740","2901680"," Maybe we're going to corporate job right now."
"2901840","2902840"," That's telling you fuck you."
"2902960","2903760"," You're not getting that raised. "
"2903780","2906280"," You're only going to get an inflation wage like 2% or something."
"2907280","2910360"," But there is a ramp going on in the background of wages."
"2915480","2917400"," Mr. Singh is asking can we look at Bitcoin?"
"2917640","2917780"," Yeah. "
"2917980","2919040"," Let's look at Bitcoin really quick."
"2921080","2922640"," So let's watch this right now."
"2923900","2925980"," Might get a nice quick squeeze out of this right here. "
"2928360","2929280"," So even a quick step."
"2929380","2929740"," We'll look at Bitcoin."
"2930380","2931380"," How you doing with Mr. Shen?"
"2931500","2931960"," How you been brother?"
"2933040","2935080"," Let's take a look at Bitcoin BTC baby. "
"2938100","2938900"," US dollar."
"2941730","2944330"," And let's take a look on a 30 minute chart."
"2944530","2945570"," I think we talked about this. "
"2947190","2949470"," Before and we're going to talk about this again."
"2949970","2953450"," We talked actually we talked about this too on before the big squeeze."
"2954350","2956430"," We talked about going to 38 right. "
"2956610","2959350"," We said I was like damn we're going to 38,000 like woo hoo."
"2959730","2960690"," Let's do it."
"2961670","2964830"," So we're going to take a look at where Bitcoin should be going. "
"2965970","2966450"," Now."
"2968310","2969270"," On here."
"2971430","2973650"," There's Bitcoin chart on the 30 minutes. "
"2973650","2976170"," You are likely going to see a pullback here."
"2977130","2978230"," You're likely going to see."
"2979710","2983550"," You've got price and rejection right now on the hourly trigger. "
"2983950","2986510"," This is very productive for a short."
"2987030","2989730"," You can see prices now underneath the hourly trigger."
"2990470","2996370"," Right here right broke below confirmed to the move lower and now just starting to hopefully come"
"2996370","2998330"," down here and trade this lower number. "
"2998750","3002030"," So we're going to expect a move to the downside on Bitcoin."
"3007000","3009600"," To a minimum of 32,000."
"3009820","3010380"," That's the expectation. "
"3010920","3012860"," I moved to 32,000 on Bitcoin."
"3014440","3016940"," But it is extremely bullish here."
"3017400","3018800"," We're going to look back here. "
"3020100","3021660"," Even with that pullback."
"3021900","3023100"," It's extremely bullish."
"3024120","3025280"," So you might be like a cap. "
"3025380","3027240"," We're extremely bearish on Bitcoin."
"3027560","3027760"," Aren't we?"
"3027860","3028640"," I'm like fuck."
"3028960","3029380"," No. "
"3029900","3031640"," We're not even done."
"3032460","3034260"," Bitcoin likely going."
"3035540","3039160"," I want to give you 38,000 right here at minimum. "
"3040260","3040800"," Okay."
"3040920","3042600"," So whatever this pullback is here."
"3043620","3046260"," There's that little gray bar that I've got there, right?"
"3052580","3054940"," Bitcoin, not done going up in my view. "
"3055840","3061780"," Bitcoin should have raced to 30,000 and hit that 38,000."
"3061780","3068240"," But it could also bounce off of the 32,000 and make that leg higher."
"3069860","3072820"," Now saying that you may be like, well, okay, cap. "
"3073040","3075020"," How will I know if it bounces on?"
"3075960","3080920"," How will I know if it's going to bounce on 32,000?"
"3082380","3084180"," And all you have to do is if you're watching."
"3087910","3090030"," Start seeing that selling coming down, right?"
"3090290","3092710"," If you see the bounce down here in that 32,000."
"3092710","3095710"," And you watch the hourly trigger. "
"3096830","3102310"," If you watch price or the early trigger regain price here, it's going to give a chance for the"
"3102310","3104570"," daily trigger to make its way higher, the yellow line."
"3104950","3106630"," That's what is really a function of."
"3107070","3110690"," We need time for the daily trigger to make its markets way up. "
"3111390","3114770"," So will Bitcoin continue the March higher?"
"3115230","3115530"," Absolutely."
"3116590","3119030"," It's just waiting on this daily trigger here."
"3119090","3121170"," So this trigger needs time. "
"3121170","3122890"," Like it needs days to pass."
"3123170","3125810"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
"3126370","3126650"," Right?"
"3126830","3128130"," Price to come down and consolidate. "
"3129190","3135250"," The hourly trigger comes down and you get your next cluster right around this 3,200 to go higher."
"3135650","3141110"," Now, if you see a blast down here to 30,000, then a regaining of the 29,000 and the"
"3141110","3142770"," regaining of that daily trigger."
"3143350","3145210"," That would also be another an easy way to watch it. "
"3145310","3146170"," We can watch it together."
"3146890","3151150"," Right now, my expectation would be a move to the downside to 30,000."
"3153130","3160250"," Consolidation and then probably about 10 sessions for the daily trigger to pick it back up with a"
"3160250","3161930"," price target of 38,000. "
"3162090","3169770"," So overall, long-term bullish on long-term bullish on long-term bullish on Bitcoin."
"3170630","3173150"," But just expect that pullback to 32,000 at minimum."
"3173990","3182610"," Maybe 29, but 32 is about the right place to look for that bounce and look for an attack on"
"3182610","3183470"," 38,000. "
"3185470","3188350"," Now, I want to give one more caveat here."
"3189410","3190650"," We're not done with this here."
"3190830","3192050"," I should have said one other thing here. "
"3192790","3200490"," If you at any point begin to see a reclaiming of, this is a 30-minute chart here, if at"
"3200490","3209090"," any point you see a reclaiming of, if you see a reclaiming of 3470 on Bitcoin, if you see a"
"3209090","3211170"," reclaim to continue to grind higher."
"3211970","3217310"," If you're looking for that target in case that does happen, I'll give you that target right now."
"3218150","3219610"," Same target, 38,000. "
"3220670","3222370"," Same target, 38,000."
"3223190","3232770"," So at any point, reclaim 3437 and can, at"
"3232770","3234870"," any point, get above 3437."
"3237030","3239110"," And can retest it successfully. "
"3239970","3242870"," You can jump on that train again."
"3243870","3245470"," Some kind of consolidation here."
"3245570","3246630"," We start to make our way higher. "
"3248110","3250370"," And you can take that long too."
"3250610","3253750"," So that long is available to you if that happens."
"3253990","3256790"," If this, if we don't get the rejection of the downside of 3,200. "
"3257850","3257930"," Fuck."
"3258090","3260890"," Yeah, if we just keep fucking grinding sideways and start heading higher."
"3262270","3262850"," 37. "
"3265990","3267670"," 3700 is your target, not 38."
"3269090","3272950"," And you could possibly even see that into late October."
"3272950","3274650"," See that 38,000. "
"3278700","3283380"," I like Bitcoin right now because it's not correlating to our market."
"3283560","3285640"," I never, I was never a believer that it correlated."
"3287160","3287560"," So. "
"3290080","3293000"," Was never, was never a believer of the correlation between."
"3295860","3297740"," Bitcoin and our stock market."
"3302070","3307480"," Let me know. "
"3307560","3308020"," Is there a panic?"
"3308160","3309100"," I haven't been on social media."
"3309260","3310800"," Is there, is there a panic in the market?"
"3311000","3311220"," Let me know."
"3311320","3312340"," Let me know if there is right now. "
"3324630","3326270"," And I don't see any catalyst for a crash."
"3326570","3328330"," So I don't know what that, what that would be."
"3329070","3331010"," Well, like crash catalyst, there would be. "
"3333320","3335560"," This all looks just orderly to me right now."
"3339090","3340850"," Oh, there's a told you so in the market right now."
"3341290","3342490"," Market's still up on the year, right?"
"3342710","3344150"," I think we're up 10% or something like that. "
"3344650","3345910"," So there shouldn't be any told you so."
"3350720","3354980"," Warning, Bitcoin will crash when the ETF comes out."
"3355160","3361000"," What's the, what do you guys, what do you guys thoughts on the, what do you guys thoughts on all"
"3361000","3364540"," the people saying, well, they need all these bitcoins available for the ETF. "
"3364540","3368600"," So it's going to squeeze to 300,000 or something."
"3369200","3370540"," I read some posts like that."
"3376380","3378280"," Lots of talk about the main shooter. "
"3381780","3385620"," Yeah, I wouldn't be, I like, I wouldn't be panicking here."
"3386500","3388600"," I was telling, I was talking to Joe this morning."
"3388760","3391260"," I'm like, we can wake up and we can wake up tomorrow and be at 440. "
"3392240","3393020"," Like I'm not one day."
"3393100","3394600"," I was like three days we could wake up at 440."
"3394600","3401900"," And the scary part of that is the market sentiment could quickly change when we're actually looking"
"3401900","3403860"," for the bearish reversal to the downside. "
"3405440","3405960"," So."
"3409000","3411240"," So I'm concerned about that too."
"3411500","3415740"," Like I'm concerned about like the, the sentimental shifts that are going to take place. "
"3416460","3417840"," Like, Oh, look, everything is fine."
"3418900","3422880"," But in reality, there's a seller there going, Oh, no, man, we're going to sell the fuck out of that"
"3422880","3423620"," 430, 440."
"3424860","3428880"," So I'm going to be fascinated to watch that as well, beginning to break S2 right now. "
"3429500","3434960"," Looking for that target down below of a 410 35 on the intraday."
"3439020","3440300"," So you guys watch some bear music?"
"3440480","3441100"," Dude, I want bear."
"3441220","3441900"," No, how about this?"
"3442980","3444120"," I'll give bear music. "
"3444300","3444940"," Hold on a second here."
"3445580","3446180"," Hold on."
"3446260","3446840"," I'll give bear music. "
"3448040","3450640"," You tag that you tag this and I'll give you bear music."
"3455840","3457380"," So bear music is right there."
"3459400","3460960"," There's where you get your bear music. "
"3467840","3468980"," Yeah, yeah, David agreed."
"3473400","3483320"," Yeah, so like again, please do not take, please do not take my warning,"
"3483740","3484500"," my risk off."
"3484760","3486320"," I want to say something to you guys here. "
"3487020","3489980"," Risk off warning, not risk off risk off warning."
"3489980","3492860"," So don't go out there and be like, cap was saying we're going to have a crash."
"3493560","3494680"," We're in a risk off warning. "
"3494840","3495820"," We're not in risk off."
"3496780","3499080"," But if we go into risk off, I'll tell you as well."
"3499260","3504140"," If we reject above right that cross, if we reject that cross, like see right here?"
"3504800","3505960"," I'm going to show you this right here. "
"3506000","3507840"," If we reject this cross right here, right?"
"3512760","3514140"," See this cross right up here?"
"3515460","3517460"," If price action rejects this cross."
"3518020","3522560"," I don't care if we squeeze above it for 440 and come back down."
"3522940","3529080"," If we start rejecting that cross down there, you go from risk off warning to actual risk off. "
"3529380","3530640"," So be aware of it."
"3531520","3532880"," You do have the cross."
"3533380","3535180"," It is official that you have the cross. "
"3535860","3538700"," It's going to lead to violent downside moves."
"3539640","3543800"," And it is also going to lead to a ricochet bounce."
"3544680","3547480"," At some point, a major upside move as well. "
"3547700","3550460"," You should see violence in this point forward."
"3551520","3557840"," And until that resolves itself, be fucking scared or anything, but just be aware of it."
"3559660","3561400"," Just be aware of what's coming. "
"3566140","3567540"," Other new highs coming from Bitcoin?"
"3568120","3569320"," Yeah, I think that they are."
"3569580","3572980"," So I think before the squeeze started, people were saying, where do you think it's going to go?"
"3572980","3578700"," I was like, you can possibly have a pullback here, I think, but it's going to 38,000."
"3578860","3580120"," So I'm on 38,000. "
"3580420","3584460"," If it goes higher than 38,000, we'll take it from there."
"3586260","3591740"," We have to wait for you're likely going to see a major supply above at that 38,000."
"3592360","3596660"," You're going to need to see a lot of work to break above that supply that's up there. "
"3596860","3600340"," Now, we can go higher than 38, but we're not there yet."
"3600340","3600880"," That's the same."
"3601060","3606200"," So what I'm talking to you guys about at risk off warning, this is the same thing for bulls on"
"3606200","3607100"," the upside on Bitcoin. "
"3608580","3610660"," When we get there, we'll talk about it."
"3610780","3613180"," Until we get until we get there, we're not going to talk about."
"3613860","3618860"," Oh, it's going to 100,000 or oh, it's going to 60,000 or anything like that. "
"3619260","3620820"," We're just going to go from level to level."
"3624060","3625360"," No, no, I get it."
"3625540","3626300"," I get what you're saying. "
"3627080","3630340"," Bears have that same door opening for them on the market right now."
"3630940","3636620"," They've got the door opening wide open right now for not 3,500, but 3,000."
"3636820","3642140"," So bears right now didn't have that door and they got it today. "
"3642440","3644840"," That door opened today to 3,000."
"3645000","3649800"," So the door to 3,000 open wide open and all they need to do now is put a door"
"3649800","3652580"," stop underneath it at 3,300 and 3,400."
"3652580","3656460"," And excuse me, 4,300 and 4,400. "
"3657120","3660580"," And once that, once that rejection happens, fuck it."
"3661360","3662860"," Hey, man, bear suit comes out."
"3663340","3669400"," It gets nasty market bleeding right now on a Thursday down to S3. "
"3671080","3675800"," And even like just even like the price action of the market."
"3676340","3680420"," Everyone's taking the money on good reports on tickers that were already beaten down."
"3681880","3684360"," Not a good sign here, not a good son. "
"3691620","3692700"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"3693680","3695500"," I'm telling you, we're on risk off warning."
"3695860","3697720"," I'm sure you were in risk. "
"3697940","3700360"," We have officially hit risk off warning."
"3701040","3704780"," And if we reject 430 and 440, we will confirm risk off."
"3705940","3710380"," And once we confirm risk off, like run fucking run. "
"3715390","3716710"," Yeah, that's what I'm doing."
"3717210","3721710"," It's been like so like last week or two weeks ago, Joe's here in the broadcast right now."
"3722330","3724190"," Like two weeks ago, I was in panic mode. "
"3724430","3728770"," I was like, I own like, so I got rid of a bunch of risk off shit or, or spec"
"3728770","3729330"," growth stuff."
"3729810","3732750"," But I left on and was adding a bunch of DIA stuff."
"3732970","3736250"," I'm like, yeah, these, I'm like, Budweiser is really in the dumpster here. "
"3736810","3737910"," I'm like, Tyson foods."
"3738490","3744630"," This is like a two decade, two decade low, like how much farther down is it coming."
"3744630","3748830"," And then two weeks ago, I was talking to Joe and I'm like, you know, man?"
"3749450","3757150"," I'm like, I'm like, if they reprice some of this shit into the spring of next year, I'll never"
"3757150","3758790"," recover from those tickers. "
"3758790","3762190"," Like I'll never recover Tyson foods if it gets repriced forever and ever."
"3762550","3768910"," I'll never recover reprising of, of like Budweiser reprice."
"3769090","3773990"," Like those things will take like, I was thinking five to six years, but I could be back in the"
"3773990","3775290"," green in five or six years. "
"3775290","3776530"," I'm like, that ain't going to work for me."
"3776630","3777570"," Not for my kids either."
"3777890","3781570"," I need them to be, and I don't want to keep throwing money at it in spring time. "
"3781850","3787690"," So I'll take the money and run and be in the green and just wait and see for the market"
"3787690","3789930"," to show me a sign to reenter for my kids."
"3790290","3797130"," So now saying all that to the holiday rally is still in motion."
"3797450","3801170"," So the holiday trade is still in motion right now. "
"3801170","3802590"," I know that sounds crazy to you too."
"3802970","3804370"," Remember timeframes here."
"3804390","3810970"," I want you to be a cognizant of timeframes and you get a Santa rally. "
"3811110","3815090"," You probably do still get a Santa rally and all this mastery and be like, how do you get a"
"3815090","3815770"," Santa rally cap?"
"3816290","3817570"," These things take time."
"3817750","3818570"," It's not a process."
"3818870","3819370"," That's one week. "
"3819650","3820310"," I know you guys are."
"3820550","3823810"," I know you bears out there like we're going to fucking zero today."
"3823930","3825570"," We'll see 3000 by Friday. "
"3825730","3827930"," That is not how things work out."
"3828530","3833750"," So even with this warning or this risk off warning, you're likely going to still see some kind of a"
"3833750","3838310"," holiday rally inside of that inside of that risk off warning."
"3839210","3841310"," So now that still is not a dead trade. "
"3841750","3843390"," I'm going to still not a dead trade at this point."
"3852830","3853930"," Who's are you guys are saying here?"
"3857340","3858780"," See what you guys are saying here."
"3859580","3862120"," I'm going to put up Twitch here. "
"3862180","3862780"," I can't see Twitch."
"3862780","3863940"," I'm going to put up Twitch here."
"3869500","3869940"," Okay. "
"3870400","3872840"," It's going on Twitch."
"3874740","3875660"," And I'll switch."
"3875660","3875780"," Cowboy up. "
"3875940","3876180"," I agreed."
"3881660","3884020"," I'm now first thing since all times is what happened?"
"3884200","3885600"," Just buying calls and winning every time."
"3888460","3891080"," What happens to just buying calls and winning every time?"
"3891080","3894640"," I'm, uh, yeah, dude, you, I make, you make tons of money buying calls. "
"3895460","3902280"," Uh, I just, I just made 90,000 fucking dollars, dude, on goddamn fucking calls and call spreads for"
"3902280","3902620"," the quarter."
"3903240","3906380"," Yeah, like, that is a fucking win."
"3909300","3910440"," What else you got now?"
"3911160","3911920"," Uh, buying puts. "
"3912720","3913880"," I'm not willing to buy puts here."
"3914200","3918280"," So I want to sell, I'm going to turn, I'm not going to, so I'm not bear here."
"3918900","3922840"," I need you guys to know that I'm not a bear until we have that confirmation of risk off. "
"3924040","3925100"," Uh, absolutely not."
"3925240","3926280"," I need to see that confirmation."
"3927120","3929300"," Uh, so for me personally, that's a good question. "
"3929440","3930080"," Who just asked that?"
"3932940","3936200"," Fairtown sheriff said I did not hear you buying puts cap."
"3936680","3941140"," I don't have any puts and I don't have any risk off protection right now."
"3941500","3944000"," Uh, I am waiting for that confirmation. "
"3944540","3946160"," So we have risk off warning, risk off confirmation."
"3946500","3947040"," We get risk off confirmation."
"3947900","3948640"," I'm with you. "
"3948860","3952720"," I'm buying puts from that point forward, uh, but not until that happens."
"3953100","3953900"," I need that confirmation."
"3954520","3955600"," I'm not that guy, dude. "
"3956360","3958040"," Um, I'll never be that guy."
"3958120","3960160"," I'll never be that guy until, until it's confirmed."
"3960520","3962120"," But once it's confirmed, I'm with you. "
"3962180","3962980"," I'll sell the market with you."
"3963560","3964260"," Good question."
"3964960","3966340"," I'll become a seller at that point. "
"3969280","3974440"," Uh, when I sold my call spreads, I was looking for another entry for call spreads and I was looking"
"3974440","3975620"," for them back down at 430."
"3976440","3978220"," Uh, there wasn't an entry for me."
"3978220","3980940"," And then down here at 420, still no entry for me. "
"3981440","3983520"," Uh, so as a matter of fact, I'm looking for them still."
"3983960","3986180"," Um, I'm still looking for that entry right now."
"3986720","3990320"," Uh, still hasn't happened, but my quarterly trade, I did publicly. "
"3991120","3995120"," Um, and if there's an extra one of those quarterly trades, I'll take them."
"3995300","3996880"," Uh, there haven't been too many of them this year."
"3997120","4002680"," So, um, but I did get, I did get that quarterly, or that monthly trade in, monthly quarterly trade"
"4002680","4005600"," in, um, it happened to print faster than I expected. "
"4006740","4009000"," Sometimes dude, I gotta hold them for fucking three months, dude."
"4009400","4011100"," It was like, it was like two weeks and it printed."
"4012120","4013340"," I took the money and ran. "
"4013660","4015980"," So they got another opportunity to buy it, buy it, I will."
"4016660","4020140"," Uh, and then if we confirm that leg lower, I would exit that trade."
"4020600","4027460"," So the example would be, uh, if I can catch the squeeze up to 440, I'll put the trade on"
"4027460","4027780"," again. "
"4028620","4029900"," I'll take the ride up to 440."
"4030460","4032460"," I'll exit to 430, 440, I'll end up exiting."
"4033480","4040420"," And, uh, then what I'll do is, uh, sit on my hands and wait to see if we confirm the"
"4040420","4040840"," risk off. "
"4041100","4044940"," If we were to confirm the risk off, I will enter as a bear then."
"4045200","4046380"," I will become a bear at that point."
"4051480","4054020"," Uh, I think we bounced about that soon. "
"4054540","4055740"," I need to know your ID."
"4056060","4060340"," I would need to know your, like, did you go pre-split or split?"
"4061000","4062820"," Uh, what's your cost basis?"
"4063440","4070280"," Uh, another thing about Amazon too is, uh, what you're using it for."
"4070580","4074840"," Uh, Amazon's, uh, um, like, uh, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, like your local"
"4074840","4080300"," financial advisor, wherever you live and you see your local financial advisor, whoever that might"
"4080300","4082520"," be, and you go down to their office and talk to them. "
"4083160","4085500"," Those guys like to buy in and out of Amazon."
"4085880","4095460"," So if your wife owns Amazon, I don't know what the, um, are you like buying it to, um, or"
"4095460","4098020"," are you buying it to sell puts against, sell calls against?"
"4098840","4100560"," It's not always the best hold."
"4101359","4103920"," If it is a hold, it's like, uh, it's something you manage. "
"4103920","4107840"," Like, buy lows, you sell highs, you buy lows, you sell highs in the quarters."
"4108660","4113160"," Um, for me, it's not really a buying hold for 20 years to stop."
"4114100","4120859"," Um, so I don't know what your personal, um, um, uh, I'd have to talk to you at some, at"
"4120859","4121180"," some point. "
"4121200","4125880"," If you want to like DM me or something or call me, you can try that, uh, method and see"
"4125880","4128020"," if I can catch up with you at some point and discuss it."
"4128120","4131420"," But, um, like Amazon's a weird one."
"4132840","4142520"," Amazon's like, uh, Amazon is like, uh, it's not an everyday managed trade, but it's like a buy it. "
"4142620","4147920"," If like, if you're a retailer, you're not using a financial advisor to manage your money, you like"
"4147920","4150060"," your wife isn't, or let's say my wife isn't."
"4150300","4153740"," Like, my kids aren't managing, uh, all these stocks that I own for them."
"4153899","4156439"," So I have to be like, yeah, do this, yeah, do that. "
"4157859","4162279"," Um, so it's hard to say for your particular situation."
"4162680","4165120"," I would consult a financial advisor to be honest with you."
"4165740","4167840"," Um, that would be my advice on Amazon. "
"4168620","4173240"," Uh, but Amazon's like, you know, every quarter you can buy it, every quarter you have a chance to"
"4173240","4173460"," sell."
"4174880","4180399"," Um, it's not like, if you're, and that is another thing, if you're like buying to, if you're buying"
"4180399","4188020"," the market to, if you're buying the market to, uh, invest as an investor, you already know that the"
"4189720","4193279"," yearly low is in the late, late winter, early spring."
"4193640","4199020"," So you should be buying then and selling, uh, whenever you get, whatever you get, whatever money"
"4199020","4200340"," you're making, whatever you're happy with, right?"
"4200600","4201960"," 10%, 20%, whatever that is. "
"4206630","4209770"," Your extended family lives in Syria is being bombed by Israel."
"4209850","4210210"," Jesus."
"4211270","4212750"," Do they have any way out to Mel?"
"4213570","4215450"," They have any way out of worth their situation?"
"4216590","4219110"," Have you, uh, have you had to be able to speak to them or no?"
"4223640","4224640"," Oh, here comes that. "
"4224680","4225840"," Should I play that bear music now?"
"4226300","4226940"," Hold on a second here."

"4243900","4244660"," Dude, always."

"4873080","4877980"," It will send an email link."
"4886800","4890460"," Looks like we're going to have James Roland coming on the show today at 1PM."
"4890760","4895740"," It looks like, technically, once we get the confirmation, we'll try to get James on here. "
"4897560","4898320"," Look at that."
"4898460","4898800"," Look at that."
"4899000","4899820"," The bottom end right now. "
"4904500","4909280"," I want to buy this right now so fucking bad."
"4911740","4913800"," I want to buy that right there."
"4914700","4916820"," I want to buy that right now with the call spread. "
"4918740","4923680"," We know that they know they like that capitulation, so we're going to wait."
"4924620","4929040"," We're going to be patient here to see if we can tag SPX or ES on that downside move."
"4931100","4933520"," All right, so that was your bear music. "
"4939290","4940030"," Set up."
"4941510","4941990"," Amazon."
"4942470","4952400"," So we've got an implied move today on Amazon of and implied"
"4952400","4957380"," move today of 6.5%. So we've got the market selling off into Amazon earnings. "
"4958220","4962440"," Someone was asking earlier what my question is or like what their question is, what I expect Amazon"
"4962440","4963060"," to do."
"4964680","4967140"," So we're going to take a look at that."
"4967280","4970520"," We're going to take a couple key points here for Amazon until the day today. "
"4971560","4972500"," Give me a second here."
"4972540","4973680"," I'm going to chart it out for you."

"5021770","5022450"," 12672. "
"5023870","5025590"," Oh yeah, that's not good."
"5027150","5028770"," That is not good."
"5032050","5032730"," 672. "
"5033130","5036770"," This is, I mean even this is showing that risk off maneuver."
"5038030","5042150"," Even Amazon is showing risk off here."
"5042310","5043410"," Risk off price action. "
"5043810","5044830"," Even on a beat."
"5046250","5050370"," Even on a beat Amazon is showing risk off."
"5050530","5051250"," Take the money and run. "
"5054940","5057160"," So let's take a look at Amazon really quick."
"5059740","5061020"," Should I buy this here?"
"5061020","5066020"," Like it's looking kind of juicy."
"5066180","5067760"," Let me look at the 30 minute out of spoons. "
"5070620","5073760"," Look at the 30 minute out of spoons and see if we're ready for juicy dip buy."
"5073920","5074880"," I got to look at some stuff here."
"5078480","5079220"," Oh yeah, dude. "
"5079420","5081040"," I want to buy the fuck out of this right now."
"5083860","5085400"," No, no, no, no, no."
"5087000","5088760"," That's good. "
"5093340","5096120"," I'm like, I'm just like dying to buy this."
"5096640","5098040"," We're going to set up some stuff today."
"5098040","5099180"," We're going to set up a call spread today. "
"5101780","5103540"," We are going to set up a call spread today."
"5103840","5109680"," Now Amazon, we're going to, I'm going to bring up the Amazon chart here for you Miffram in a"
"5109680","5109940"," minute."

"5117180","5122700"," You guys are going to do Intel, Chipotle, Ford, any of those I'll do."
"5123640","5126540"," What's the, here I'm going to do a poll right now."
"5128360","5129500"," I'm going to do a poll. "

"5145020","5145420"," Start a poll."
"5147700","5151660"," Which, so I'm going to do Amazon for sure."
"5160060","5160560"," You know what?"
"5160680","5160940"," Fuck it. "
"5160980","5161720"," I'm not even going to do a poll."
"5162260","5164860"," I'm just going to do them all."
"5165120","5166940"," So we're going to do four of them today. "
"5167080","5171280"," So I'm going to do Amazon expectations on Amazon."
"5172860","5177320"," I'm going to do expectations on Intel, Chipotle, and Ford."
"5177980","5178140"," Okay. "
"5179740","5185180"," So, so Amazon, Intel, Chipotle, and Ford, you'll get expectations done for me on today."
"5187980","5196270"," And those will be the four that we watched into the end of today."
"5200610","5202590"," Man, Intel's showing the same thing. "
"5203010","5205930"," Intel, Intel, Intel, Intel."
"5206150","5213510"," Set up for even, like even good report on Intel is setting itself up for, uh, Selva news."
"5214990","5217170"," I'm going to click second here and check Intel. "
"5221810","5231650"," And T.C. Downside move,"
"5231890","5233690"," 3044 and 3409."
"5237340","5238060"," 3444."
"5260290","5261390"," Hold on here. "
"5265740","5267540"," Okay, so that's Intel."
"5270340","5271900"," 34 something, right?"
"5272220","5273380"," What's the applied move there?"
"5275440","5278580"," Applied move of 5.6%, 3415."
"5281660","5286100"," Even that is looking pretty fucking bearish, even if they win. "
"5287780","5294340"," Uh, even if Intel wins, they're going to, we've got, uh, what's the other one for today?"
"5294540","5306880"," We've got, that's CMG."
"5315780","5321180"," CMG 1910, 1713, 1910, 1713."
"5331480","5341000"," Ooh, I am, uh, I kind of like CMG here. "
"5342740","5347700"," Uh, no, hold on, let me see if we get that right."
"5349300","5353520"," 1910, 1713."
"5353820","5354740"," Okay, that's not too bad. "
"5359230","5360110"," Yeah, I'm lying."
"5362150","5365610"," Instead I was bullish on this one, but this one, this one's kind of the same way."
"5365710","5366190"," A little bit better. "
"5366190","5370610"," It's probably has a little bit better, uh, prospects today."
"5373130","5382910"," Well, not, I'd say, I'd say CMG is more bearish today than Amazon and Intel look like they"
"5382910","5387290"," could have good ERs, but then it's sell the money and go."
"5387950","5392510"," CMG looks like it's going to get some decent numbers. "
"5392670","5393790"," It's going to be similar to Google."
"5394330","5396810"," Decent numbers and then it's sell down to 1700."
"5398070","5400910"," Uh, maybe they get some bad numbers mixed into Chipotle. "
"5401690","5404350"," Now the GDP numbers is going to disagree with that, right?"
"5404970","5407990"," They're going to say that, um, it's a bullish on the kickass earnings."
"5409770","5413610"," On their bleeding down, they've got a cross, they've already got a confirmed cross to the downside"
"5413610","5415590"," and they're already super bearish."
"5415670","5417490"," So, we'll talk about this one as well. "
"5418210","5420130"," Uh, still overall bearish on CMG."
"5420130","5423650"," And then what was the last one we're going to do today?"
"5424170","5425830"," Oh yeah, our friend Ford."
"5426310","5427730"," We're going to do Ford next. "
"5430210","5431570"," To our friend Ford."
"5436610","5438070"," 1186, 1089."
"5439830","5440990"," Let's bring up Ford. "
"5450850","5453110"," Still pounding and grinding right now."
"5455270","5455950"," Here."
"5459380","5462020"," Still pounding and grinding the market right here. "
"5472300","5473880"," What am I looking for here?"
"5474060","5474640"," Close that up."
"5476780","5477880"," What did I say?"
"5478340","5479760"," 1088, 1185."
"5488680","5489360"," 1088. "
"5494860","5495540"," 1185."
"5496680","5497240"," Oof."
"5501240","5502380"," Ford, Ford, Ford. "
"5502700","5509440"," Now Ford, is going to try to spin good news on their ER."
"5510360","5510960"," That's guaranteed."
"5512700","5514240"," Uh, you should go into the Detroit subreddit. "
"5514520","5516380"," They're talking about, they were talking about it last night."
"5519740","5520300"," Ford."
"5525010","5526250"," 30 minutes on Ford. "
"5526790","5528690"," Okay, so I got all these done right now."
"5530130","5532170"," We're going to do, what do we say we do?"
"5532430","5532750"," Amazon?"
"5533510","5534070"," AMZN."
"5535730","5538210"," Uh, we're going to do CMG. "
"5538650","5539670"," We're going to do CMG."
"5540670","5541950"," We're going to do Ford."
"5543770","5545330"," We're going to do INTC. "
"5547710","5549210"," Those four right there."
"5554270","5555170"," Oh shoot."
"5556770","5558290"," Let me get one more thing to do. "
"5566590","5567970"," Don't get right there, that works."
"5575400","5576560"," We're going to start with Amazon."
"5589870","5591210"," Uh, we never, we never do. "
"5592030","5593550"," Uh, we shouldn't crash through it."
"5593690","5594850"," There should be no reason to crash through it."
"5600060","5602960"," There's no historical precedence for that happening to get bought. "
"5605000","5609900"," There might be a little bit of overlap due to, uh, needing the tag ES and SPX, but we'll just"
"5609900","5610460"," check all three."
"5610920","5611760"," It should get bought."
"5626420","5628820"," This is like, when this is all red is when you're buying dips. "
"5628860","5631480"," When this is all super deep green, this is when you're selling."
"5634180","5636680"," So, yeah, I'm against you on that one."
"5637520","5638960"," And disagreement on that one. "
"5639280","5641220"," This is kind of like, think about this."
"5643580","5644860"," Think about this right here."
"5644980","5649520"," If this was all super deep green and you're talking about us going to the all-time highs, I'd be"
"5649520","5650560"," like, fuck you, we are. "
"5651180","5652940"," We're going to be taking the money and running over here."
"5661710","5664390"," Yeah, I'm going to look at some call spreads right now."
"5666430","5668470"," So, I'm going to look at that too right now. "
"5668530","5669270"," Give me a second here."
"5673820","5676300"," I'm going to look at some call spreads."
"5682600","5685060"," On Spy Shit. "
"5691890","5692990"," That's P-Y."
"5696390","5696910"," Push."
"5702140","5702660"," Credit. "
"5705020","5707040"," Yeah, I like the idea of a credit put spread."
"5709640","5712340"," I think I might like the credit put spread better here."
"5713060","5722400"," Yeah, I'm going to go for the credit"
"5722400","5724860"," put spread instead of the call spread. "
"5742920","5744160"," You want a quick second here."
"5753150","5754030"," Okay, spoons."
"5761370","5766350"," I got to dig through the options chain two and take a look and see where the where all the"
"5766350","5767090"," money is in this. "
"5767090","5767550"," So, hold on."
"5768430","5769950"," We got some work to do here."
"5772530","5774990"," Bullish and I'm going to go with credit spread and not. "
"5778110","5783090"," So, how do I explain the credit versus the what's the easy way to explain the credit versus."
"5785970","5786670"," Hold on."
"5787390","5788930"," For you guys out there at home. "
"5790170","5796170"," Easy way to explain the credit spread visual way to explain credit spread versus."
"5801610","5802910"," It's going to be hard to explain."
"5805050","5806590"," How do I explain this best?"
"5812330","5814270"," There's a green box right there, right?"
"5817390","5819790"," There's a green box right here. "
"5826240","5829200"," There's a red box."
"5830080","5831520"," Red box right there."
"5832460","5834240"," A red box right here. "
"5839560","5844180"," This is a debit spread right there."
"5844520","5845300"," That's where you get make money."
"5846160","5851520"," Credit spread, I can take the dip and then actually make money on the acceleration to the upside"
"5851520","5851920"," here. "
"5852040","5853280"," It's more of an acceleration play."
"5855140","5860000"," So, I'm more interested in this one over here than I am in this one over here."
"5861440","5863920"," So, credit spread for me is the way that I'm going to go. "
"5864020","5864700"," It's a little bit risk here."
"5864820","5868260"," There's some danger to margin calls, of course."
"5869600","5874680"," So, if you don't understand the difference between a credit spread and a debit spread, the debit"
"5874680","5880840"," spread is more your friend and easier than a credit spread to manage, and you don't want to, of"
"5880840","5882120"," course, get a margin call. "
"5882560","5887360"," So, if you don't understand any of the mechanics of that, don't be trading credit spreads unless"
"5887360","5888660"," you understand the mechanics of it."
"5899290","5900050"," Dude, why are we?"
"5900450","5902450"," Dude, we're still up on the air."
"5902590","5903050"," We're not in a crash. "
"5903230","5904270"," We're not crashed here."
"5904590","5905630"," Just so you know, we haven't crashed."
"5906090","5906510"," We haven't crashed. "
"5906510","5907530"," We haven't had 1997."
"5908330","5909150"," We haven't had any crash."
"5909450","5910330"," We haven't had any craziness. "
"5910910","5911830"," Wait a minute, shit."
"5911990","5912370"," It's 1246."
"5912590","5912850"," Give me a second. "
"5913030","5914910"," I got to get a roll."
"5915070","5916190"," Mr. Roland signed up here."
"5919010","5919590"," Those are insane. "
"5922890","5923250"," Okay."
"5923470","5924290"," So, he hasn't responded."
"5924470","5928670"," So, I'm assuming he's good on the 1 p.m. So, what am I looking for here?"
"5928790","5931910"," I'm looking at Spy Bullish Trade down here. "
"5933070","5938250"," I want to see that 410 get tagged, but we are trading for a 412-27 right now."
"5938250","5938390"," now."
"5938810","5942670"," So I want that like max like I'm going to bring the trade up and we're going to just watch"
"5942670","5945710"," it in the background and we're not going to place trade yet. "
"5945930","5950370"," We're going to place trade though once we get down there and slam into that 410."
"5950830","5959870"," Now that 410 I'm spy is not going to be as important as whatever the SPX and the ES bottoms"
"5959870","5960090"," are."
"5960270","5968650"," So be aware of this be dip by thing that I have down here and those numbers that I'm showing"
"5968650","5977490"," you 4113.50, 4124.50. Look for that capitulation to put this trade on and I'll place the trade with"
"5977490","5979070"," you here in stream. "
"5979830","5984050"," Now I'm looking for because of the spread I'm looking for December 29th"
"5984050","5994010"," and I'm what"
"5994010","5994710"," am I going to do here?"
"5996650","5998570"," Hang tight one second here."
"6000210","6007450"," So I'm doing a credit put spread and not a debit spread and I'm going to look for"
"6007450","6012190"," 440 on the upside."
"6016220","6017180"," Save strike. "
"6020760","6022320"," Continue and what do I need to be?"
"6025660","6027320"," I'm losing all my money down there."
"6027420","6028540"," I'm losing all my money down there."
"6031220","6032060"," That's not a good one. "
"6032060","6033200"," I don't like that at all."
"6036780","6037180"," I"
"6037180","6048980"," don't"
"6050870","6050870"," like that one."
"6052310","6053510"," I don't like that one either. "
"6055030","6059430"," I don't know if I like the credit put spread."
"6065230","6067550"," Break even above 420."
"6068470","6069390"," That's not that good. "
"6070690","6074550"," I don't know if I like the credit put spread and me not like that trade."
"6076350","6078110"," I might be going back to debit call spread."
"6078810","6079270"," Look at this one. "
"6079270","6085960"," I don't think I don't think I like that one 440."
"6087640","6090120"," Save 412."
"6091520","6093720"," Damn none of these spreads are looking good right now. "
"6100090","6109940"," Or December 37 probability break even point is 429"
"6109940","6110480"," 430."
"6116120","6117260"," Oh 420."
"6119020","6120220"," Does that show them?"
"6121180","6123140"," 750 for 750. "
"6124320","6125080"," I like that one."
"6127340","6133380"," Okay, so the spread that I'm looking at right now is let me just check this one more time."
"6136000","6141200"," It's 420 to 440 like credit debit spread or debit call spread. "
"6141200","6141820"," Excuse me."
"6152510","6153990"," Just check this really quick."
"6160460","6161480"," Save strike. "
"6171860","6172820"," That's about the same."
"6173020","6174420"," That's about the same money."
"6178260","6179520"," About the same money. "
"6179920","6181140"," I still like the debit spread."
"6181320","6182040"," I guess I like the debit spread."
"6182160","6183680"," I thought I'd like the credit spread but I don't. "
"6185760","6188900"," I'm going to look for the actual bottom and time this fucker just right."
"6191680","6193560"," I'm going to try to I'm going to try to time this one."
"6193700","6195320"," I'm going to try to time this thing like bawler. "
"6195860","6196680"," Okay, so 420."
"6199960","6204200"," Save strike 420 to 440 credit debit or excuse me."
"6205320","6211880"," Call debit spread costs right now it costs 750 bucks to make 1250. "
"6212180","6214700"," So the date on it is December 29th."
"6220660","6230580"," I need to buy December 29th hit 427.60 to be at least flat"
"6230580","6231740"," or making money."
"6238810","6240590"," So I've got that set up in the background. "
"6242310","6242990"," I was ready to rock."
"6245250","6250780"," He got beats you good."
"6255960","6258640"," You want to see a cost spread that poorest can do. "
"6259940","6262120"," You can you can lower the date."
"6263660","6265220"," You can make the date sooner."
"6270100","6271400"," What's poor for you?"
"6274040","6276620"," I mean the estimated cost is $750. "
"6277700","6279840"," You don't have $750 to place one of those."
"6280560","6282020"," It's 750 bucks."
"6282480","6284120"," If you don't have $750 you shouldn't be trading. "
"6285340","6288540"," So if you're saying you don't trade at $750 we got an issue."
"6290580","6292600"," I mean we have an issue."
"6294280","6295820"," So right now it's 750. "
"6296520","6301560"," Now if we continue to head lower that should become a cheaper call spread."
"6302400","6305160"," Should be like 700 bucks 650 something like that."
"6307260","6310020"," So we're going to monitor this price all right now it's 752. "
"6316650","6319630"," That's a debit call spread for December 29th."
"6320950","6326390"," I know you guys are all beared up right now but this is not the time to be all beared"
"6326390","6328330"," up because it's time for you to start looking for a dip."
"6329550","6339590"," So debit call spread expiration December 29th the spread is $424.40. Yeah"
"6349350","6360640"," that's what"
"6360640","6368140"," I do normally I'll buy the leg separate or it depends if you're doing I don't know about Robinhood"
"6368140","6368900"," or what they do. "
"6369080","6373000"," I don't know if you're platform does for you."
"6373120","6376600"," I know that options.ai you can't close legs separately."
"6377880","6385120"," So I would never place that trade in options.ai. But if you place the trades individually you can"
"6385120","6387180"," you know I don't know about Robinhood. "
"6387460","6388480"," I don't know about you."
"6388600","6395120"," I place these trades on tasty so I can close and open legs whenever I want."
"6396400","6398220"," But I don't know about your platform. "
"6398440","6403040"," Make sure that your platform allows you to close individual legs whenever you like."
"6404680","6406180"," That's an important question right."
"6408040","6411260"," An important question is can you close legs. "
"6411560","6416580"," I don't think you can on options.ai. I ended up putting some money in with them and running some"
"6416580","6420380"," trades on options.ai and I don't think I could."
"6420520","6423880"," I think I was pissed off because I tried to close some legs and I couldn't."
"6424660","6426660"," And so I was like no fuck that sir. "
"6426920","6429300"," It's great for quick and dirty calculations."
"6429760","6433460"," The platform but that's all it's good for it."
"6433680","6434440"," I'm not a fan. "
"6434640","6440460"," I don't like it's I don't like it's I also don't like something about options.ai. I don't like it's"
"6440460","6443240"," it's fills."
"6443580","6444520"," I think their fills suck."
"6445100","6452860"," So that's yeah if you get that way I don't like trading like that. "
"6453340","6461820"," Where you like have to open and close same time or yeah open or close or"
"6461820","6469050"," it's December 29th."
"6482140","6485600"," Yeah it sucks like I can't it could be a kick ass site."
"6485720","6486820"," It could be a great platform. "
"6487140","6488140"," It's just not there yet."
"6488940","6493740"," I don't know why that is but I think the guy I don't know exactly who's running it but I"
"6493740","6502640"," think it's Ben Zinga I can't I potential."
"6503480","6509740"," The one thing that really sucks about it is the broke or the order flow selling that and the order"
"6509740","6511400"," flow selling that they do is vicious. "
"6511880","6513520"," It's got some of the worst fills I've ever found."
"6514840","6520660"," Some of the worst fills I've seen are on that that platform but I fucking love quick and dirty like"
"6520660","6522600"," are you bullish are you bearish are you."
"6523380","6529360"," This here's a quick and dirty neutral trade here's a quick and dirty bullish traders quick and"
"6529360","6538180"," dirty bearish trade and it's visually quick it's quick not like inundated with you want to learn"

"6745040","6753840"," bid and not the ask so you sometimes you have to give a little bit on filling call spreads"

"6953770","6953930"," Yes."
"6954490","6955630"," It's good to be back man."
"6956090","6959330"," Let me hold on here. "
"6959770","6961690"," Let me put you on screen here."
"6964650","6965690"," Oh yeah."
"6966370","6967390"," We're squeezing right now. "
"6968830","6970770"," Tag in one of those FIB levels right now."
"6973650","6976490"," There's some five minute bullish divs there."
"6976730","6977230"," There is. "
"6977690","6978330"," There is."
"6978530","6979390"," We're getting close dude."
"6981090","6982590"," We're also nearing the monthly trigger. "
"6983090","6984810"," So yep, we're nearing the monthly trigger."
"6985930","6991550"," We've got downside could be coming to a close here."
"6991550","6999490"," But I would really need to see some bullish hourly divergences before, you know, really getting"
"6999490","7001590"," confident in any sort of lasting bounce. "
"7002070","7002530"," Yep."
"7003270","7007330"," Did you notice the daily weekly trigger cross today?"
"7008170","7008650"," Yeah."
"7009250","7009850"," Yes, I did. "
"7010770","7014590"," And you want to discuss at any point about well, hold on."
"7014670","7015210"," Let's start the beginning."
"7016310","7017210"," We'll get there. "
"7017870","7018610"," Number one."
"7018810","7020970"," Welcome back to the United States of America."
"7021870","7022590"," Thank you. "
"7022690","7023490"," Good to see your face."
"7024130","7027410"," Yeah, I got a lot of warm welcome backs from your crowd."
"7027450","7028630"," So I appreciate. "
"7030030","7031570"," Welcome back to the United States."
"7031570","7033030"," That was a very hairy situation."
"7034070","7034870"," Yes, it was. "
"7035510","7038170"," And your family must be ecstatic that your home I'm assuming."
"7038970","7039410"," Definitely."
"7039930","7040750"," Right on right on. "
"7041290","7042830"," We'll stay out of the politics of all that."
"7042990","7047830"," We're not going to get into the politics and like set ourselves up to get under a bus or anything."
"7048190","7050950"," But I just want to say that from all of us, a trade trigger. "
"7052610","7055970"," What we do our whole entire community wants to say welcome home."
"7056170","7058210"," We don't want to see anybody getting killed anyone at all."
"7058950","7059310"," Yeah. "
"7060690","7063350"," Now back into the let's start."
"7063670","7065250"," You know, we can start wherever you like."
"7065490","7071430"," But the main thing is we got it or the main thing from, at least from my side is we"
"7071430","7075310"," had a cross of the daily trigger of the weekly trigger price did not. "
"7076110","7079470"," Thread the needle above and through before the cross took place."
"7080890","7082230"," And then that it's a warning."
"7082690","7087970"," It's not it's not it's not necessarily a crash warning, but it's a risk off warning that would need"
"7087970","7093670"," to be confirmed, in my view, at least need to be confirmed with a price rejection. "
"7094810","7097310"," At that cross or even slightly above it."
"7097350","7102370"," If we like to squeeze above it and then we bounce it and roll down some more that would still"
"7102370","7105550"," that would then be a confirmation of that risk off in the marketplace."
"7106250","7111170"," So you want to just talk about your take on all of this and I'll shut up and we'll listen"
"7111170","7111550"," to you. "
"7112770","7115210"," Yeah, so Oh, hold on a second."
"7115390","7116130"," By the way, by the way, go ahead."
"7116650","7116910"," Start talking. "
"7117710","7118970"," No, what is it."
"7119350","7122710"," I was going to tell people to follow you on Twitter first, but you do your thing and then I'm"
"7122710","7124450"," going to set all that up for you."
"7125150","7129850"," Okay, so we turn bearish last Wednesday. "
"7130150","7130470"," That's right."
"7131390","7133470"," Boax spiked into the propagation zone."
"7134170","7136050"," It was 1 30 in the afternoon, right?"
"7136230","7137770"," 1 32 p.m. last Wednesday. "
"7138750","7146030"," Yeah, so that night's forecast on means that watch was, okay, this might be the start of some heavy"
"7146030","7146330"," downside."
"7146530","7148510"," Yeah, one second."
"7148790","7150290"," Just seeing one across the weekly trigger. "
"7150290","7154830"," Yeah, and then, you know, shortly after that, we'll blow the weekly trigger, which Pretty"
"7154830","7157930"," surprisingly, let's acceleration straight down to the monthly trigger."
"7158190","7162670"," Almost a $20 drop over the course of, you know, four or five days."
"7162890","7165890"," So definitely a lot of money to be made on that short. "
"7166770","7174510"," We did see a lot of put selling last night, only on Spy, not on QQQ, but again, Boax was"
"7174510","7176790"," deep deep into the propagation zone."
"7176950","7183690"," So although put selling, you know, can give indications of a bottom and they're definitely usually"
"7183690","7193470"," on target when Boax is deep in the propagation zone, exactly trust them as much because they don't"
"7193470","7195010"," know that Boax is in the propagation zone."
"7195190","7200870"," And for those of you here in Boax for the first time, I can't really show it from right here,"
"7201250","7206650"," but the propagation zone just basically tells us that the market is unstable and unstable stocks,"
"7207010","7208790"," ETFs, equities tend to fall in price. "
"7209030","7210870"," I have a little X on my trading view."
"7211010","7213950"," I don't know if I have it on this account, but I have shown here, but you want to try"
"7213950","7214730"," to bring it up if I can?"
"7215630","7216770"," If you can, sure."
"7217030","7217670"," Let me take a peek. "
"7218110","7218570"," I'll look in the background."
"7218810","7219110"," Keep talking."
"7219630","7225690"," Yeah, so, you know, we saw this heavy downside and now we're nearing the monthly traders. "
"7226030","7232350"," So for not only a psychological support level, but just the big support level in general."
"7232490","7241670"," The issue here is that Boax is deep in the propagation zone and it doesn't seem like we can have"
"7241670","7248130"," any sustainable bounces because Boax is also deep in the propagation zone for Tesla, Apple, Amazon,"
"7248610","7255010"," Google, not Netflix and Meta yet, at least, NVIDIA AMD."
"7255690","7260830"," So a lot of big names, we have those in the propagation zone and we're not even looking to go"
"7260830","7267710"," long until we can see Boax start to move out of the propagation zone, indicating that stability is"
"7267710","7273630"," returning to the market, in which case, we'd expect a counter trend move back up to the daily"
"7273630","7280190"," trigger, which is currently at $4.29. So for now, can you explain simplify it for him saying you're"
"7280190","7285030"," instead of trying to buy dips on the hourly or daily, you're going to be selling all of that shit. "
"7285890","7286450"," Yeah."
"7286750","7294250"," For now, it seems like there's just too much instability in the market for any for any bounces to"
"7294250","7294810"," be sustained."
"7294810","7299490"," You also see hourly velocity making a new low with each new price low. "
"7300090","7305150"," So if the woman a trigger can cross above the five minute trigger and hourly velocity could start"
"7305150","7308250"," repairing when they get a move back up to the hourly trigger."
"7308550","7314130"," Doesn't seem likely from where I stand, because what you would want to see here is a new low with"
"7314130","7319130"," hourly velocity now making a new low, and that would be the first sign that sellers are running out"
"7319130","7322190"," of steam right now sellers look like they're completely in control."
"7322190","7325250"," I mean, wouldn't expect any bullish one five crossovers. "
"7325530","7327470"," Did you guys catch that bear plane today?"
"7328470","7331190"," Uh, the, I caught one."
"7331550","7333810"," So I caught the hourly trend."
"7334150","7335990"," So two days ago on Tuesday, right?"
"7337250","7338250"," Oh, well, hold on. "
"7338250","7339770"," So Monday, we saw it."
"7339910","7341330"," So last week, right?"
"7342130","7345230"," On Wednesday, we had that first signal to the downside."
"7345810","7348790"," Then on Friday, we had the next push down, right?"
"7348790","7353630"," So Wednesday, Friday, 1.30 in the afternoon, major cell signals, right?"
"7354070","7358850"," On Monday, we came back and tagged that Friday cell signal. "
"7359070","7360110"," So that was like, oh, that's fine."
"7360270","7360550"," That's good."
"7362070","7370450"," And then we went into Tuesday and we were beginning an hourly trend change to the upside, but it"
"7370450","7372070"," needed to be confirmed on. "
"7372070","7374510"," It needed to be confirmed on Wednesday open."
"7375370","7381710"," So when we, so Wednesday open is when I thought in my view, the Wednesday open, not having that."
"7382050","7386650"," Not having to squeeze up from Tuesday into Wednesday and then the bounce to the upside. "
"7386970","7391350"," It immediately said sell the fucking market to that downside monthly trigger."
"7393030","7397930"," So as soon as that happened, then today, of course, I didn't see the bull plane or the bear playing"
"7397930","7400770"," myself on today because it wasn't on the market this early this morning."
"7401270","7405370"," But as soon as I saw, or as soon as I saw the cross this morning, I was like, oh,"
"7405470","7408830"," we're not fucked, but the door is open now. "
"7408910","7410050"," The risk of warning is here."
"7410930","7411290"," Yeah."
"7412010","7416050"," I wish it wasn't going to show my screen, but you can show your screen. "
"7416150","7416750"," You want to show your screen?"
"7418690","7419410"," My, my."
"7419570","7420150"," Are you on your phone?"
"7420830","7421790"," Yeah, I'm on my phone."
"7422110","7430730"," You're on your phone. "
"7430730","7434930"," I was just sitting on my phone with the only short I hit for today, but yesterday also, I was"
"7434930","7436690"," able to hit a big short so for now."
"7437070","7442190"," So I'm also just sitting on my hands like I caught two nice big downside moves."
"7443110","7448290"," And I wouldn't want to short this close to the monthly trigger after a $20 job, I feel like if"
"7448290","7450410"," you're shorting now, maybe a little late to the party. "
"7450670","7452630"," That's what I think it's too late to the party."
"7452630","7456250"," Yeah, but, but I also don't see a good reason to get long."
"7456570","7461910"," So for me, it's like, I feel like now is just a good time to take a step back, hit"
"7461910","7466170"," two big trades, now just wait and watch to take a long trade. "
"7466510","7469970"," I would want to see a new low with bullish hourly velocity."
"7470530","7470610"," Yeah."
"7470610","7474590"," I would want to see a woman triggered across above the five minute trigger and hourly velocity"
"7474590","7478730"," start to repair right now, you know, it's at the most negative spin all day. "
"7479150","7481750"," So, I wouldn't try to be logging this."
"7482010","7486030"," So my bear playing alert came out on Wednesday the 18th."
"7486990","7490970"," Bear playing alert my bear panel plan alert came out on Wednesday the 18th right here. "
"7492070","7493930"," And it is not resolved at all."
"7494430","7494550"," So."
"7496130","7501630"," So that's a Wednesday, 18th bear playing boom down, boom down, selling the half in one hour"
"7501630","7507190"," triggers and now I'm looking for capitulation so totally see some good fucking capitulation. "
"7510350","7511810"," Right, those are just see."
"7511810","7518250"," Or reversal, or reversal trigger is price broke below the weekly trigger."
"7519070","7528370"," Last week on on Thursday and cascaded literally $1 to the downside in only five trading days so"
"7528370","7533190"," very important to understand the implications of price breaking little to the trigger, which is"
"7533190","7541710"," among this acceleration level explain the people what the like the simplified version of how to"
"7541710","7550750"," think about like the weekly being emotional, the implication of price being below or the cross of"
"7550750","7555510"," the daily trigger over the weekly how long that can last for like days, weeks, months, that kind of"
"7555510","7555810"," stuff and"
"7555810","7566570"," then"
"7566570","7571330"," the Yeah, so again, all triggers are simply acceleration levels. "
"7572970","7577910"," Emotional battlegrounds between bulls and bears and below the weekly trigger."
"7578450","7584590"," What what usually happens is a lot of funds will either close out longs or a lot of funds will"
"7584590","7590650"," get short because they're aware of these levels whether whether they're honest or not."
"7591390","7597110"," Yeah, and whether they're visual visualizing them through triggers or other methods, the point is"
"7597110","7599830"," those are the important levels of the market. "
"7600410","7606750"," And so in price breaks below the trigger, you see longs big longs big funds run for the hills while"
"7606750","7612130"," shorts come piling in because they understand implications of price breaking below a really strong"
"7612130","7619510"," emotional battle battleground battle zone, whatever you want to call it between bulls and bears and"
"7619510","7625750"," price being pushed pushed down below that level shows that bears won the battle and downside is"
"7625750","7626650"," then to be expected."
"7627450","7631450"," You feel to see once the hourly trigger across below the weekly trigger, there was a retest to the"
"7631450","7634090"," hourly trigger on on Tuesday."
"7634490","7637310"," And that that gave a really hard rejection. "
"7637750","7639790"," So once price is below the weekly trigger."
"7640430","7643930"," Yeah, that Tuesday closed man that Tuesday closed where it happened."
"7644610","7645490"," Yeah, exactly. "
"7645950","7648710"," We opened on Wednesday morning and it was on to the downside."
"7649510","7654910"," Our bulls needed to open above that hourly trigger on Wednesday or retest like squeeze up on the"
"7654910","7659690"," overnight and then come back down and test the turn Tuesday failed to do it open below it."
"7659870","7661290"," And that just tells you right there. "
"7661430","7665710"," There's no will buy and they're taking the money and running on these even good reports on the"
"7665710","7665910"," underlying."
"7665910","7666210"," Right."
"7666750","7672170"," Which is because once the hourly trigger is below the weekly trigger, the hourly trigger is going"
"7672170","7674050"," to provide more of a resistance. "
"7675030","7678330"," So we're not expecting price at all to break above the hourly trigger."
"7678650","7681790"," And as a trader, we want to do is wait for price to get as close to the hourly trigger"
"7681790","7682450"," as possible."
"7682990","7687810"," Get short with the only stop loss being if the five minute trigger then crosses back above the"
"7687810","7691270"," hourly trigger and hourly velocity starts to pick up to the upside. "
"7692990","7697610"," But otherwise with price below the weekly trigger and the hourly trigger below the weekly trigger,"
"7698010","7701130"," the only objective is just to sell balances."
"7702110","7706070"," You know, until price can prove itself that it can indeed get above the hourly trigger."
"7706490","7710310"," But that's not what is expected when below the weekly trigger. "
"7710570","7710990"," Exactly."
"7711730","7712210"," Yeah."
"7712370","7716510"," There's no expectation that we're going to break above and clear it all like bulls have all kinds"
"7716510","7717310"," of work to do. "
"7718490","7720110"," Well, they can get both again."
"7720510","7722810"," They can't, you just can't like catch this bottom."
"7722810","7727230"," Like at this point, you can't catch bottom here and say, Hey, this is the bottom at this point. "
"7727430","7731730"," There's a state of sellers just waiting at four thirty four forty."
"7732330","7732810"," Exactly."
"7733150","7734430"," So they're not going to sell here. "
"7734650","7736930"," They're going to sell on bounces up to the hourly trigger."
"7736930","7741330"," See QQQ yesterday slid below the hourly trigger at three fifty three."
"7741550","7743870"," And one day later, we're already at three forty three. "
"7743970","7744910"," So that's a $10 drop."
"7745010","7746630"," That was a short that I had big on."
"7747130","7753590"," I closed too early because I'm way worse at trading downside that I am trading upside. "
"7754150","7757310"," Yeah, I inherited the chart actually and I showed the discord."
"7757570","7760320"," I was like, it's the only way to explain to people, man."
"7760720","7765800"," Yeah, I'm saying that's the only way to show it to the same system upside down. "
"7765820","7770120"," Oh, yeah, it's definitely still being like calls that was a bullish break, but I have a lot of"
"7770120","7771700"," trouble trading downside."
"7771720","7774900"," It's my biggest weakness as a trader that and cutting too early."
"7774960","7776980"," So that's something I want to work on. "
"7777640","7781660"," Otherwise, I could have made, you know, probably five that's more than what I did yesterday in that"
"7781660","7781880"," short."
"7782740","7784320"," But all comes to time."
"7784460","7785160"," All comes to practice. "
"7785620","7791140"," But for now, again, the outlook on the market is currently bounces will be sold until books can"
"7791140","7792500"," move out of the propagation zone."
"7792920","7798540"," Back into this ability zone, which tells us that the market is becoming more stable, stable stocks"
"7798540","7801580"," tend to rise, and that's when we'll be willing to get along again."
"7802140","7810140"," For now, with our velocity declining on spy on QPQ, no bounces are expected to last until and"
"7810140","7812740"," unless the one minute trigger can cross above the five minute trigger. "
"7813500","7815480"," And our velocity can start repairing."
"7816780","7823020"," You can watch right now s one is the hip hip point s one is coming or the hourly triggers"
"7823020","7826060"," coming into where that s one is right now above so you can see it up here."
"7828020","7831560"," Another thing to hear would be another thing. "
"7831680","7833260"," Another question for you would be."
"7833700","7834560"," Am I losing you?"
"7835100","7835980"," No, I'm here."
"7836200","7836560"," All right, sweet. "
"7838600","7840080"," Another question here would be."
"7842160","7842720"," It's like."
"7843640","7845740"," So I was discussing with. "
"7851100","7856300"," The rest of these earnings, even if they're good, do you think that that is the."
"7858180","7860840"," It'll kill a continuation or is it take the money and run?"
"7861120","7863660"," It seems like that's what it is on all of this earnings season."
"7863660","7867820"," Any of the any great earnings is like, boom, we get the great, but even myself, I'm exiting. "
"7869320","7873420"," Tickers will as soon as I'm not like, I'm looking for continuation the rest of the week on the"
"7873420","7873680"," sticker."
"7874380","7876580"," As soon as it squeezes up, I'm like, I'm out of here."
"7876640","7877720"," I'm done until springtime. "
"7877980","7879900"," Do you feel like there'll be continuation?"
"7881040","7883020"," I don't feel like there'll be any continuation."
"7883560","7884340"," Yeah, me neither."
"7884640","7885840"," I was pretty bullish. "
"7886100","7886960"," Now I'm losing all bullshit."
"7887820","7888180"," Yeah."
"7889540","7891700"," There's no, I don't have any bullishness right now. "
"7891960","7892980"," I wish I did."
"7893260","7898640"," And I always want to lean bullish because I make all my money in bull markets, not bear markets."
"7899640","7901140"," But for now, the outlook is bleak. "
"7901460","7904320"," Like I'm more than likely going to be cooling off on the trades."
"7905020","7908060"," I try to go for like one or two good hits a day."
"7908240","7910820"," Like, for example, if price pops up to five in the trigger. "
"7911460","7917120"," If you just look back at the entire downside move, those were great places to get short."
"7917780","7921420"," So, for example, just in the past couple of days from Tuesday."
"7922100","7927100"," So we had a huge sell at the five in the trigger on Wednesday, which went from QQ one from"
"7927100","7929020"," 355 to 349. "
"7929360","7931760"," It's a six dollar move straight off the five in the trigger."
"7932580","7937460"," And then again, late Wednesday, right before the close, we got up to the five in the trigger again"
"7937460","7937760"," at 350."
"7938760","7939680"," And sold down to 345. "
"7940380","7941720"," That's another five dollar move."
"7941720","7946320"," And then this morning we bounced up to the five in the trigger at the 47 and sold down to"
"7946320","7946620"," 342."
"7947020","7948660"," That's another five dollar move. "
"7948900","7952020"," So if you're at home right now is the red line."
"7952400","7953700"," This is the five minute trigger."
"7953880","7956720"," You can see five empty and then up here, you've got the 30 minute trigger today. "
"7957520","7962280"," They've been selling off the 30 and then we're looking for an extended trading hours on."
"7962520","7965300"," So again, you've extended trading hours on."
"7965760","7966380"," I do. "
"7966740","7967600"," I think I do."
"7970020","7971600"," So take those off for a second."
"7971800","7972380"," Yeah, hold on a second. "
"7980870","7981930"," I took off the."
"7982590","7983970"," Why did I leave the dividends on?"
"7984110","7985470"," I think I wanted to take dividends off."
"7988190","7993630"," I don't know why I've got dividends on this chart right now. "
"7993630","7997750"," So if you go down to the bottom, you'll see ETH for extended trading hours."
"7998570","7999810"," I know where it is."
"7999910","8000750"," I got it off right now. "
"8001730","8004110"," Okay, so it's a word that by you."
"8006230","8008870"," The div X is the one that always screws me up."
"8009610","8010610"," I don't know why it's back on. "
"8012170","8012650"," Okay."
"8013050","8013210"," Yeah."
"8013450","8018330"," So, I mean, I've just been selling five minute trigger retests because with no bullish hourly"
"8018330","8023410"," divergences we're expecting the five minute trigger to act as resistance every single time. "
"8023410","8027190"," So there was about three really good trade setups in the past couple of days."
"8027250","8031170"," But I'm not here, you know, sitting in shorts or whatever, like, although I should be."
"8031290","8036230"," And again, if this was bullish and it would be airplanes, then I'd get long at the five minute"
"8036230","8037710"," trigger and stay long and stay long. "
"8038610","8043850"," But because I'm so bad at trading bear markets, I just take the money and run after I get like"
"8043850","8046450"," a nice rejection off of the five minute trigger."
"8046690","8051810"," So I left thousands and thousands on the table over the past few days, but I still made some money."
"8051810","8052850"," So I can't really complain. "
"8053390","8059170"," But in the future, I'll be inverting my chart because, I mean, that would help me hold positions"
"8059170","8060070"," for so much longer."
"8060450","8061230"," I didn't trade yesterday."
"8061630","8062050"," I stayed away. "
"8062230","8065150"," Not to stay away, but I got caught up in the morning with a bunch of bullshit."
"8065450","8068990"," And then the market already started selling them like, yeah, then I had some other bullshit in the"
"8068990","8069330"," afternoon."
"8069490","8071050"," Not bullshit, but stuff I have to take care of. "
"8072270","8073470"," Tuesday made great money."
"8073850","8077110"," Yesterday would have been a great sell signal to sell down and then even into today."
"8078870","8086130"," David AMS likes to talk about how you have the, which coincides with a lot of what you do. "
"8086290","8087090"," There's a lot of overlap."
"8087870","8090810"," But where Monday is the trade, Tuesday is the manipulation."
"8091830","8094990"," Wednesday is the mark up or mark down. "
"8096390","8098490"," And then Thursday, you get the finish."
"8098770","8099950"," I think I get that right."
"8100150","8103090"," Mark up mark down on Wednesday, which we had the mark down yesterday. "
"8103750","8105830"," And then Thursday, this should be the end of the trade."
"8106830","8109850"," And then they exit into Friday on a weekly basis, at least."
"8112810","8116130"," Yeah, matter of fact, I got to talk to you at some point because a lot of what he's doing"
"8116130","8118150"," is a lot of what you're doing and what I'm doing. "
"8118150","8121350"," And we should, I want to talk to you about quarters and stuff."
"8121570","8125630"," This has all comes back to the clock in the time of the day and when the markets open and"
"8125630","8130630"," close and what the algorithms are trying to do on a yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily"
"8130630","8131190"," basis."
"8132270","8137330"," As a matter of fact, you can even put that all that down on a one day basis for that"
"8137330","8137870"," one o'clock. "
"8138050","8145090"," Right now, you came out at 1 p.m. So we should see between now and two o'clock some"
"8145090","8147210"," kind of some kind of an answer, right?"
"8148790","8152310"," Or some kind of a move that I should say."
"8152890","8154090"," And I'm expecting it to the downside."
"8154470","8155250"," It's one 24 right now. "
"8155330","8156490"," We're going to have an hour to look for it."
"8157130","8159010"," We should get a capitulation move."
"8160530","8166930"," Well, one thing I will say that I'm happy about is that the data really saw this downside coming"
"8166930","8175350"," all over on Apple on Google on spy and QQ on on Tesla. "
"8175930","8180410"," I mean, last Wednesday is when everything moved into the propagation zone."
"8180410","8188390"," So I was able, I gave like a little rant for the forecast just basically saying like, okay."
"8189110","8190670"," This is now looking dangerous. "
"8191490","8197670"," You know, most of the propagation zone on the market is extremely unstable and downside should be"
"8197670","8198070"," expected."
"8198969","8200629"," And then the weekly forecast as well."
"8201389","8207290"," I don't think I wish you could bring it up, but yeah, I mean, give me a subscription, bro. "
"8208969","8210230"," I will give you a subscription."
"8210309","8211150"," I know I know you would."
"8212730","8213770"," Never asked for one. "
"8213930","8214610"," I know I did."
"8214809","8215170"," I will."
"8216910","8217549"," We've got one. "
"8218250","8221070"," We plug him in right here."
"8221230","8222070"," So I've got it plugged in."
"8222150","8223190"," I just have it. "
"8223450","8223889"," I just have it."
"8224309","8225549"," So I've got it right there."
"8225889","8229690"," So rather, we end up doing where it just pops up and tells you this is bad news. "
"8229930","8230410"," We're going down."
"8232670","8238610"," So we, and then of course, when it reverses to the upside, we get that alert as well."
"8239049","8242309"," If you want what you could use, you can make a free trial. "
"8244250","8244650"," Yeah."
"8244730","8250270"," There's seven free trial and then you could just, then you could just like show the forecast, but"
"8250270","8250870"," it's fine."
"8251070","8252110"," It'll take some time anyway. "
"8252830","8258010"," I got a, we're going to start sending the alerts out for the bull planes and bear planes for the,"
"8258070","8265110"," for the major upper or major trend reversals, but the confirmation of them, but right now it's just"
"8265110","8266450"," on the tool like you have to be off."
"8266450","8269450"," You have to have a tool and see it pop up or alert you."
"8272730","8273129"," Yeah. "
"8273129","8279709"," So yeah, I mean, long story short, we're not expecting any bounces to last for a little bit."
"8280129","8283610"," So if you're not expecting any bounces to be sustainable, right?"
"8284090","8285150"," Yeah, bounces."
"8285510","8286690"," I just look at as opportunities. "
"8287170","8290389"," So, like you can see right there, like price couldn't even get up to the five minutes."
"8290389","8295150"," No, because hourly velocity is at the most extreme right now."
"8295290","8296990"," So, you know, that's an obvious short. "
"8297469","8302590"," It's just, you know, short bounces until there's a bullish one and five in the trigger crossover."
"8303010","8309190"," Once that happens in, it's more than likely not going to go straight up to the hourly trigger, but"
"8309190","8312230"," what it will do is it'll start repairing hourly velocity."
"8312709","8318790"," Probably enter a couple of day period of just chop while hourly velocity gets better and improves"
"8318790","8321629"," and any new lows would just be bullish divergences. "
"8322150","8324170"," And that's when we can start expecting your verse."
"8324370","8325790"," So at least back up to the hourly trigger."
"8325790","8335549"," So, are you, is your, your views are changing into, into your views are changing"
"8335549","8345549"," into the late winter and early spring, I'm assuming, or late spring, maybe February, April, into"
"8345549","8347090"," more bear stance, right?"
"8347090","8352629"," I don't think there's much to be bullish about right now, especially with the daily triggered"
"8352629","8357389"," crossing below the weekly trigger, and especially with QQQ, just breaking below it's weekly trigger"
"8357389","8357950"," only yesterday. "
"8358270","8358570"," That's right."
"8358830","8359129"," That's right."
"8359510","8364850"," No, we can, we can see QQ come all the way down to 325 and then probably not one shot. "
"8365950","8369410"," First hourly triggers crossing below that we can trigger on QQ right now."
"8369870","8374190"," There can be a bounce up to our trigger that will likely be a great place to get short again."
"8374190","8374889"," Yeah. "
"8376350","8382670"," Amazon showing, so all the big tech names, all the big boys are showing the coming into a cross."
"8383090","8392710"," And they're the options market for those tickers on that cross on any surprise good news"
"8392710","8396070"," and the options market ends right at the cross as well."
"8396070","8402430"," So an example being the options, the implied move today for Amazon is up to its daily trigger"
"8402430","8404150"," that's crossing its weekly right now. "
"8404430","8410810"," So even Amazon is like, yeah, even if you get a good fucking report, the options market is, is"
"8410810","8414130"," there to sell that crop that right at that cross above."
"8414670","8415090"," Yeah."
"8415610","8419170"," Yeah, it's very doubtful that any upset move in Amazon will be sustained. "
"8420410","8422030"," Yeah, agreed 100%."
"8423010","8425850"," Now, do you think there's, I know there's some people out there that."
"8427690","8430990"," This morning, we're talking about, and my view is going there as well. "
"8431170","8432750"," It's not, it's not for me."
"8432850","8433850"," It's not confirmed yet."
"8434070","8434630"," I need to see. "
"8435590","8439410"," That confirmation rejection on the daily and weekly cross."
"8440190","8441970"," For me personally, I need to see that."
"8443510","8444990"," That attempt to repair. "
"8445230","8446030"," And if it doesn't repair."
"8447230","8450710"," That we, that we speak in that March lower, but even saying that."
"8452810","8458790"," With no catalyst, like a COVID or a war, I know people want to use war as a as a"
"8458790","8463610"," catalyst, but without any real true, like, hey, we're in World War three or some, some kind of"
"8463610","8463890"," nonsense. "
"8465270","8472330"," Or, I don't know, JPM is walking around looking for free cash, like we did in 2000."
"8473210","8475530"," That wasn't JPM, but there were other banks doing that."
"8476110","8481510"," But without that catalyst, I know that there's a, like, a fervor where we are right now. "
"8481630","8484110"," I'm like, we got bears, like, foaming at the mouth here."
"8484210","8485270"," And I'm like, easy."
"8485750","8489430"," I'm like, this should be a process that takes months, not a week. "
"8490830","8495730"," Do you want to say, are you thinking more along the week or are you thinking more along the line"
"8495730","8499290"," of it's a process that'll take into, it'll take three to six months to."
"8499290","8503330"," To make those moves lower."
"8504470","8510030"," Yeah, I think right now where we are with spy at his monthly trigger. "
"8510170","8516330"," I think maybe there's a drop more downside left, but I do think we are due for a relief rally"
"8516330","8517370"," off the monthly trigger."
"8517550","8520290"," Now, whether that only gets up to the hour."
"8520290","8526750"," Or the daily, or whether it bounces all the way back up to the daily, I think that bounce well"
"8526750","8528610"," will end up having to be sold. "
"8528890","8529390"," Yeah, I agree."
"8530130","8535670"," And, you know, what I plan on warning it, my group is that, you know, when we do get that"
"8535670","8541050"," bounce, if we do get that bounce, that's not a reason to turn bullish at all more of a reason"
"8541050","8543210"," to get ready to short."
"8546130","8552950"," Yeah, so the day that you're crossing the weekly trigger pretty much solidifies the idea that over"
"8552950","8557470"," the next coming months, we're going to head down further, but that doesn't mean that there can't be"
"8557470","8561150"," a sharp bounce back up to the daily trigger before continue downside. "
"8561530","8564790"," I'd expect one large bounce off the monthly trigger."
"8565950","8570670"," Whether that, again, that bounce could take us to the hourly trigger 420, the daily trigger to 430."
"8571310","8571410"," Yeah. "
"8571690","8576810"," That's one I think the real move down will start and press it then break below the monthly trigger."
"8577450","8578010"," Yeah."
"8579770","8585770"," With the failure of now with this with this happening, right?"
"8587210","8592570"," And the failure to get a new high this year. "
"8594570","8599490"," On the previous high of January, 2022, right?"
"8599630","8600650"," We had the high in January."
"8600810","8603130"," Remember, we entered January 6 and started selling."
"8605250","8605850"," Right. "
"8606410","8608630"," And so we had the, we had the."
"8609590","8612490"," The downside move for all 2022, right?"
"8612670","8613670"," Came all the way down into October."
"8614750","8619850"," Start to come back up from October into into the new year and then came all the way up into"
"8619850","8622590"," most of 2023. "
"8622750","8626110"," We came up, but we failed to get that new high, right?"
"8626910","8627350"," Mm hmm."
"8628070","8634110"," Get that failure of getting that new high that the back, whatever back test there would have been"
"8634110","8638970"," either on that previous high or way back down to 350."
"8639310","8641370"," Do you think the door is now open?"
"8642170","8647130"," Not confirmed, but open to lower than 350 by springtime. "
"8647370","8647510"," Is it?"
"8647850","8648750"," Is it used to?"
"8649160","8652770"," You think there's even more propensity to get even lower, like 3000."
"8654590","8657850"," I'm not turning into like a crash beer right now."
"8658050","8665070"," More of just my macro overview now is short rips back up to the hourly trigger to the daily"
"8665070","8665310"," trigger. "
"8665310","8669030"," Like I'm not getting bearish for like a crash."
"8669030","8669630"," Yeah."
"8669890","8670290"," Necessarily. "
"8671790","8677270"," But again, like I was very bullish up until Wednesday, like up until I was there."
"8677410","8677930"," Oh, it's too."
"8678130","8678350"," Absolutely. "
"8678630","8683130"," Yeah, prices was above the weekly trigger prices above the hourly trigger prices above the daily"
"8683130","8683310"," trigger."
"8683410","8685630"," There was no reason to be bullish to be bearish."
"8685690","8687410"," There wasn't then either. "
"8687670","8692070"," You have to have, you have to explain to the people that you have, you need to be confirmed for"
"8692070","8696210"," each level of bearishness and then when you can even jump in on that stuff."
"8696390","8697690"," So or bullishness doesn't matter."
"8697690","8698850"," Exactly. "
"8699350","8707990"," So I was definitely bullish about even, even probably within, let's see, uh, Tuesday at October"
"8707990","8712670"," 17th, like I was bullish price was above the hourly daily and weekly trigger."
"8712890","8720090"," But thankfully one day later Wednesday night, we saw bullets move into the propagation zone and"
"8720090","8727670"," price was still at 433 at the time."
"8727670","8733410"," So I was like, okay, like I was fully bullish over the past couple of months over the past couple"
"8733410","8734490"," of weeks, et cetera. "
"8735130","8737290"," But now now things look bad."
"8737490","8738970"," Now things are starting to look really bad."
"8739230","8739330"," Yeah. "
"8739450","8741210"," So just looking for that, close the door."
"8741350","8744070"," They're about to close the door on the bulls and it's not going to be pretty."
"8744230","8744630"," It's going to be. "
"8745110","8745510"," Right."
"8745730","8746130"," Exactly."
"8746730","8752230"," So that's, that's a good part about being able to adapt with different data prints night to night. "
"8752950","8757410"," Because I was able to warn subscribers about incoming downside already at 433."
"8757630","8759350"," And now we're $21 lower in a week."
"8759930","8762110"," So you can have bullish news. "
"8762290","8767890"," You can have bearish views, but on the macro, but as long as you can adapt when the data changes"
"8767890","8769830"," or price loses an important trigger."
"8770550","8774130"," Like, for example, it doesn't matter if I think the market's going to 500 in March."
"8774370","8780450"," If price breaks below the weekly trigger yesterday, then I'm going to be bearish because that's"
"8780450","8780830"," exactly. "
"8780830","8781910"," All that."
"8782210","8788610"," Any, any thesis that I have always hasn't in validation about where I then go and flip the other"
"8788610","8788810"," way."
"8789070","8789470"," Yeah. "
"8789590","8797530"," It's the same thing where the cool part about it too is that if price, price goes above the daily"
"8797530","8803330"," trigger and the hourly comes sweeping back up, but then the daily swings high above the weekly"
"8803330","8808510"," trigger, you have to change that, that warning over to, hey, we're getting bearish again, start"
"8808510","8809010"," getting long."
"8809210","8809590"," You can't."
"8809930","8810330"," Exactly. "
"8810970","8812970"," People will start being like, what about going to the downside?"
"8813330","8814650"," It's like, no, man, it's invalidated."
"8814650","8815830"," Now we're going higher from here."
"8816030","8817750"," So close those quick shorts out. "
"8817890","8818110"," Let's go."
"8818250","8818630"," Let's get long."
"8819130","8820870"," And that's how you make profit. "
"8821150","8825290"," You know, if you just have a thesis and you just stick to it and stick it and stick to"
"8825290","8827190"," it when things are going another way."
"8827410","8829730"," Yeah, they're wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong."
"8829730","8830610"," Right. "
"8830870","8835830"," So having Boex being able to clearly define when the market's stable, when the market's unstable"
"8835830","8838450"," helps us have a macro outlook."
"8839370","8843170"," Those moving into the propagation zone last Wednesday was obviously very bearish."
"8843170","8844410"," That sounded all the alarms. "
"8844790","8845970"," Yeah, that's my alarm."
"8846150","8847750"," That's my bear."
"8847750","8851290"," My bear alerts on this fucking toolman was like. "
"8852370","8854570"," Done Wednesday was bad Wednesday."
"8854830","8855810"," Wednesday was bad."
"8856010","8858590"," Then Friday was really bad of last week. "
"8858630","8862010"," And then we resolved the Friday, but we still had to resolve the Wednesday."
"8862010","8863910"," I put a post on Twitter about it last week."
"8864270","8868170"," And we cleared out the Friday, but we did not clear out the Wednesday. "
"8868790","8873690"," And then this and then this Wednesday, or this Tuesday, the close."
"8874430","8881870"," Dude, that Google man, like Google was like bad, like they need a stellar and they didn't get that"
"8881870","8882230"," stellar."
"8882670","8886930"," Google had three bearish weekly divergences and sold right down to the weekend trigger. "
"8887250","8888570"," Yeah, we were bearish on Google."
"8888810","8889730"," We were bullish on Microsoft."
"8889730","8890750"," We got that one. "
"8890890","8891390"," We got Visa."
"8891390","8898670"," I was scared about Visa, but I really wanted to see snap hit 20 or it's it wants to go"
"8898670","8900050"," there, but it's still not able to get there."
"8900450","8904770"," It might be able to get up there after the next after this at the 27th expiration for their"
"8904770","8910530"," options, Jane, but I mean, I'm actually interested in snap to this day still trading that. "
"8910570","8910690"," Yeah."
"8911750","8916590"," Yeah, I took some lot of snap calls because there's a lot of selling to be before."
"8916950","8917070"," Yeah. "
"8917070","8921610"," I went up to 1150 at 10.5 calls, but twice, right?"
"8922210","8923490"," Yeah, but it didn't hold the move."
"8923650","8924450"," So I ended up taking the loss."
"8924670","8926050"," I only bought five contracts. "
"8926470","8927710"," So it's squeezed up into the open."
"8927710","8928870"," Didn't it yesterday or something?"
"8929270","8930090"," I thought it was into the open."
"8930090","8930990"," It was squeezing up again. "
"8931450","8933230"," Like 830 or something."
"8935710","8939310"," Yeah, but right now we're by, you know, this close to the month of trigger."
"8939330","8944870"," Like if I had kept my puts, which I wish I did once price broke below the week of trigger. "
"8945470","8951630"," Right here is where I'd be closing them because I can't really expect much more downside with, with"
"8951630","8953110"," spy this close to the month of trigger."
"8953370","8954590"," So maybe it gets down to 410."
"8954790","8960610"," Maybe it just starts to chop here and starts to set up a reversal later, but right here is when"
"8960610","8965910"," I would start closing out, closing out shorts. "
"8965910","8968170"," I wouldn't be."
"8968870","8975130"," I obviously like, you know, again, on the macro daily trigger crossing below the weekly trigger"
"8975130","8979970"," makes me think that we won't get back up above 430."
"8980450","8986450"," Anytime soon, but right here, I don't think is the best place to be bearish because we just dropped"
"8986450","8988750"," on the weekly trigger straight to the monthly trigger right here. "
"8988750","8994870"," Is there anything route expects by to catch to start catching some some support at the month of"
"8994870","8995010"," trigger?"
"8995250","9005130"," Do you do you think that whether we trade this for 18 or 412 410 do you think that"
"9005130","9012550"," they're like to me to me the Santa rally or the holiday rally or the happens that usually at the"
"9012550","9014990"," end of the year, not always, but when it does happen."
"9016690","9018130"," Seasonally, it happens as well."
"9018570","9024630"," On average, it's the trade is with the bulls, not the bears, like 70% of the time. "
"9025030","9027930"," So, but price matters."
"9028210","9035370"," Oftentimes, the holiday rally quote unquote holiday rally, the expectation for on the surface"
"9035370","9038850"," expectation is, well, that's all time highs for the year or something."
"9038850","9044150"," When in reality, it could just be whatever the low of the season is, there should just be a ramp. "
"9044770","9049270"," Do you think that there will be no holiday rally for this fall?"
"9050310","9053850"," They will any holiday rally into the 31st of December will be."
"9054370","9060550"," I mean, I think we're probably some sort of retracement backup to the hourly trigger or even to the"
"9060550","9060930"," daily trigger."
"9060930","9065410"," I think for the hourly trigger at 419, the daily trigger at 430. "
"9065490","9070490"," I think those are reasonable targets from here, but I wouldn't go along just yet."
"9070690","9075470"," I want to see some, some kind of turn first and then long a pullback."
"9075870","9080730"," Like I'm not in a rush to get long, but I would hope the month of trigger at 410 does"
"9080730","9083410"," its job and provides provides its support. "
"9083690","9086750"," So, although I would not be shorting anymore."
"9087230","9093090"," After this leg down, I'm not ready to get long for a balance until we see some implications that a"
"9093090","9093650"," balance is ready."
"9093890","9097650"," Let's say the one minute trigger crossing above the five minute trigger hourly velocity start"
"9097650","9098650"," appearing right now. "
"9098970","9105770"," It just looks like, you know, sideways top, maybe a drop more down, but again, there's very, very."
"9107190","9110610"," Again, honestly, hourly velocity just printed a lower print."
"9110910","9116430"," So, yeah, there may be a teeny bit more downside, but here's the last place I'd be shorting out of"
"9116430","9117430"," this entire job. "
"9117710","9120030"," Yeah, the move the other the trade was last Wednesday."
"9120350","9122510"," The trade is the trade wasn't today."
"9123250","9127270"," It just bothers me so much how quickly I cut all my short positions. "
"9127430","9133170"," Again, I have to I have to invert, invert the chart for next time because I looked at it."
"9133170","9140170"," And if you invert the chart and you see how bullish bullish it would have held the entire time, no"
"9140170","9140430"," doubt."
"9141150","9145750"," So, I am like really kicking myself about that because I really could have played this way better,"
"9145750","9149690"," but I hope some of the subscribers would just held puts throughout this entire thing. "
"9149690","9156470"," You know, for me, man, for me, for my own personal trading, I'm a dip buyer."
"9156870","9158230"," Now, I don't trust the dip buys."
"9158510","9163810"," Matter of fact, on Tuesday, I bought some weekly calls on the bottom on SPX. "
"9164190","9168670"," We bounced down below on SPX and I bought some calls weekly's."
"9168670","9173590"," We will blast it up north, right into the close, anticipating all those earnings."
"9173770","9175970"," My weekly's had printed 100%. "
"9176710","9182910"," Fucking close took money, left some zero dates on added some zero dates for like the 15 minute time"
"9182910","9184230"," period after the closing bell."
"9184610","9187730"," But I even said in stream arrows, like, it's not sustainable."
"9188090","9191630"," And you also want to see the back test that I only trigger hold to even attempt to go up"
"9191630","9192650"," to the daily trigger. "
"9192650","9199090"," And, of course, that following or in the overnight and the rest of the guidance reports that came"
"9199090","9201530"," out and all other bullshit, we started rolling down on Wednesday."
"9203450","9209510"," But I guess I'm asking that question because as we're down here right now, I'm considering putting"
"9209510","9215690"," on my second quarterly call spread for the 29th of December."
"9215690","9223970"," Now, and I realized that there's risk here of that sell on for 30 or even higher, but or that"
"9223970","9224930"," it's not sustainable. "
"9226250","9228230"," I don't know if I'm on the same agree."
"9228550","9234290"," I mean, I, I understand the mechanics of waiting until we're above the hourly again to try to make"
"9234290","9235730"," the attempt for the daily and the weekly."
"9238950","9243070"," I think right here, you know, if you're willing to have a stop loss below the monthly trigger. "
"9243390","9244430"," That's what I'm saying, man."
"9244550","9246410"," Let's we start rejecting that week that monthly trigger."
"9246810","9249310"," I'm on that fucking trade for December 29. "
"9250010","9255210"," Yeah, I mean, odds here statistically, you have a better chance of bouncing up to the hourly"
"9255210","9257110"," trigger than breaking down below the monthly trigger."
"9257110","9263450"," So with the figure at 410 and hourly trigger at 419, it makes more sense to me to take that"
"9263450","9268530"," long trade, but I just personally wouldn't do it until there's a bullish one five crossover."
"9268990","9271430"," And I see the hourly velocity start repairing. "
"9271430","9273630"," I'm not in a rush to try to catch the bottom here."
"9273950","9274130"," Yeah."
"9274850","9279390"," But I agree, like I really do think down side should be wrapping up right here at the monthly"
"9279390","9279610"," trigger. "
"9279610","9285210"," I mean, I'm bearish, but I'm not a bear until we reject that."
"9285390","9291570"," I need to see any attempt by buyers to or not attempt."
"9292190","9298510"," I'm looking for the failure of buyers at the daily trigger cross on the weekly trigger. "
"9299010","9304270"," Like the failure will sentiment all the major trigger cross you would expect to a retreat."
"9305890","9306970"," It's very possible."
"9307110","9307370"," That's fine. "
"9307490","9310230"," And it's liquidity grab any of that oversold conditions."
"9310230","9315770"," You've got like sectors over sold all kinds of mechanics that just have to happen for that"
"9315770","9316270"," confirmation."
"9317970","9324570"," So for me to be like, I'm buying puts like with for me to be like buying puts with with"
"9324570","9325130"," conviction. "
"9326910","9328670"," It's not going to be until that happens."
"9328710","9330490"," And then I'll switch to bear town."
"9330730","9331790"," Like I'm going to be a fucking bear. "
"9331790","9335510"," I put again until another move up to the hourly trigger."
"9335890","9336650"," Like I'm done."
"9337530","9340590"," Do you don't want to see that DT fucking rejecting. "
"9342090","9343190"," Yeah, that's right."
"9343970","9348730"," If there's a bounce back to daily trigger after the daily trigger is now crossed below the weekly"
"9348730","9349050"," trigger."
"9349310","9352010"," We expect the daily trigger to provide a really strong rejection. "
"9352470","9352950"," Yeah."
"9354570","9354570"," Yeah."
"9354730","9357050"," So that's where that's probably the next place I would get short. "
"9357050","9362430"," But yeah, I mean, statistically you have better odds of hitting a long trade here up to that really"
"9362430","9364650"," trigger than shorting to blow the monthly trigger."
"9364930","9369710"," So I would say, you know, a quarterly call of call spread could probably worth."
"9370410","9375690"," And then if price does continue to head down to the monthly trigger, what you could do is you could"
"9375690","9378050"," close out the short side of the trade average. "
"9378830","9381750"," Lower into the long side of the trade and cut the whole thing."
"9381750","9384190"," If the five minute trigger crosses below the monthly trigger."
"9384290","9387790"," I'm watching premium pick in on these call spreads right now. "
"9387930","9390410"," We're at 760 there at 740."
"9390890","9393490"," And we're literally bouncing around here."
"9394090","9399990"," Like right in here, we went from 440, 420 call spread for December 29th. "
"9400530","9401690"," It was right here."
"9401890","9406010"," It was $7 or 740."
"9408050","9409090"," $740 or not. "
"9409250","9410810"," It's 760 right here."
"9412490","9414690"," What price is right here, price down here."
"9414810","9416870"," So a big $20 difference in those spreads. "
"9418510","9418870"," Yeah."
"9419510","9421330"," There's a little bit of rotation here."
"9421730","9423290"," That doesn't mean we don't roll back down though. "
"9423410","9426030"," Either guys like I got a time if you're watching this program right now."
"9427250","9433170"," What James is saying here is that even if you're looking for that, the K cap is this the bottom."
"9433170","9438990"," There is still a high high high probability of like if you're going to do a call spread, it's not"
"9438990","9439830"," going to matter as much. "
"9440010","9445770"," But even if we squeeze up here and then rip back down and slam into that that monthly trigger."
"9447070","9449870"," And then and then there's the actual bounce."
"9449870","9456170"," So that's that consolidation forming that that tentative bottom action that he's talking about. "
"9463150","9469310"," Now we can see if the woman and sugar can cross above the five here, then the velocity can start"
"9469310","9473430"," repairing and then we can start to get that move back up to the hour of the trigger."
"9473950","9475890"," So let's see what happens here."
"9476490","9480950"," Again, three bullish divergences are usually the start of hourly velocity turning. "
"9481790","9488650"," So regardless of if this crossover is successful or not, we most likely just put in the most"
"9488650","9490730"," extreme hourly velocity print to the downside."
"9491350","9496130"," Looks like capitulation, which again, we expected again as price near as the monthly trigger."
"9496470","9499910"," And if you want to know if the monthly triggers in a hold or not, you want to start looking"
"9499910","9502710"," for bullish divergences forming five and hourly. "
"9503010","9504510"," So it starts at the five in a level."
"9504930","9509790"," You can see in the chart, it's really clear there was one new low, then two new lows, then three"
"9509790","9510150"," new lows."
"9510990","9514930"," Just recently, right to the right of where it says dip by on your chart. "
"9515830","9515890"," Yep."
"9516710","9522010"," So like a centimeter to the right is the first new low, and then you have a consecutive lows where"
"9522010","9525590"," five minute velocity did not print a lower low."
"9525770","9530390"," So yeah, I would say this is more than likely right now where we stand. "
"9531730","9537110"," Whether it, whether we do get a bullish cross, which isn't expected or a bear plane, which"
"9537110","9538950"," statistically is higher odds."
"9540230","9543410"," Either way, this is going to be the most extreme hourly print."
"9544570","9549890"," And hourly velocity next hour will for the first time since the downside started will probably be"
"9549890","9550650"," able to start appearing. "
"9551070","9553310"," So yeah, this looks."
"9553750","9555350"," Hey, you know what I'll heads up too."
"9555450","9559590"," So that was long visa owning visa. "
"9560730","9563870"," But it's just kept like grinding, grinding, grinding, right, grinding."
"9563970","9568230"," But if you in your own time, when you have a chance, take a peek at the weekly and monthly"
"9568230","9569150"," velocity."
"9569870","9576390"," It's been on like massive decline, even though it's like a huge price velocity divergence on that"
"9576390","9576930"," ticker. "
"9577330","9580570"," I ended up exiting it after on Tuesday, ended up exiting."
"9580790","9585810"," But that one's just like prime fucking candidate to shorten the depths of hell."
"9587110","9587790"," It's something. "
"9595430","9596890"," One second here."
"9598110","9599070"," All right, let's see it."
"9599150","9603610"," Let me check the, let me check the chat here and see if anyone has any questions for you. "
"9604390","9606070"," I can make one quick second here."
"9608430","9613090"," If you guys have any questions on YouTube or Twitch, ask away."
"9620010","9626350"," Does anybody have any questions on on on Twitter or not Twitter on Twitch or YouTube?"
"9627450","9629670"," I'm going to read both of you guys are saying. "
"9634450","9638830"," The positioning was Tuesday through Thursday afternoon Friday is a lot of day either way."
"9639310","9648310"," That's from David AMS. Mr. Talking Monkey is asking, how do you think this will affect, affect Vix?"
"9650230","9652230"," I've been taking a look at Vix in a while. "
"9652770","9654690"," I've been watching STXs instead."
"9663770","9664890"," So, wow."
"9666330","9668690"," Looks like Vix is above its wanted chartered. "
"9671970","9673250"," Do you think Vix can hit?"
"9673930","9675150"," Well, it's not even well."
"9675430","9683870"," So from my perspective, at least on Vix, I posted the Vix seasonality chart on trade, the trigger,"
"9684030","9685010"," the handle trade, the trigger."
"9685470","9687590"," So you can go back and look at that if you guys want. "
"9688770","9690310"," And the Vix seasonality."
"9690830","9698290"," And now the other thing too is you shouldn't see Vix spikes to 30 unless you do begin to break"
"9698290","9699970"," below that monthly trigger, right?"
"9700970","9703850"," The C starts seeing Sigma moves outside of the expected ranges."
"9705210","9710230"," So right now you're not going to see that spike unless you begin to break underneath that monthly"
"9710230","9711330"," trigger. "
"9712570","9717710"," You'll actually start to see it to reject that daily trigger on any retest."
"9718450","9720010"," I started to break below that 410."
"9720470","9722370"," We still haven't actually broken trend either on spy. "
"9723530","9726730"," I know that some people are saying we broke trend, but we haven't."
"9727390","9728430"," Mathematically, we have not."
"9729410","9730810"," Here's spy specific. "
"9731050","9732150"," Let's look at spy really quick."
"9732910","9738850"," I'm going to just show you guys the like to the exact we have not broken trend to the upside."
"9740690","9741570"," Let's hold on here. "
"9741970","9743890"," Let me give a quick one with trigger screen."
"9744030","9744830"," This is spy right here."
"9745470","9750250"," You can see these channels are calculated with high math, not me or you drawing this at home. "
"9752090","9756440"," I go to a one day chart here."
"9756660","9758620"," This is going back into December."
"9760820","9762340"," We can just do it at SPX. "
"9762760","9763040"," It's cleaner."
"9770330","9772770"," You can see that we're actually above trend."
"9772770","9776470"," This is the low from October down here. "
"9777250","9780370"," We still have not broken that October trend low."
"9780870","9784130"," We still haven't technically broken trend, brother."
"9784690","9786650"," I remember this. "
"9786890","9795870"," I remember in October, everyone was trying to claim that they called the rip in December and March."
"9796910","9801650"," All these large accounts on social media were like, this is when the trend changed."
"9802390","9803470"," But it didn't. "
"9803730","9810890"," Trend changed October 12 down here and we've run that trend since October of 2022."
"9811330","9817370"," No matter what anyone out there tells you, that is when the uptrend began and trend has stayed"
"9817370","9817730"," there."
"9818130","9819610"," We've been on trend since then. "
"9819870","9824090"," So even where we are right now, this goes back to that same conversation."
"9824810","9828770"," The bears put the door on put the door on this market."
"9829390","9835010"," They need or bears need to see that rejection up here. "
"9835770","9840110"," And then we start we get it on or I guess the other thing would be if we broke the"
"9840110","9841230"," monthly trigger up here."
"9842130","9846730"," And then the daily trigger chased down, like start chasing to the downside."
"9847670","9849890"," And then we just get that capitulation move. "
"9850150","9851870"," This would be like a 1987."
"9852530","9857290"," My only problem with the 1987 correlation is that shit didn't take 10 days."
"9857290","9861270"," Three weeks fucking four months to do. "
"9861530","9863430"," So I'm not on the 1987 bullshit."
"9863650","9865090"," This is not a 1987 move."
"9865490","9867510"," It's not measured in a 1987 move. "
"9867670","9868110"," None of it works."
"9869490","9875270"," So you'd have to see that break of that monthly trigger and then you'd want to see the daily come"
"9875270","9880770"," down and start to chase all the way down and have that serious collapse that you guys are talking"
"9880770","9881130"," about."
"9881270","9885970"," So even right now, just from a mathematical perspective, we are still on trend from the October"
"9885970","9886490"," low. "
"9887430","9889510"," Nothing has actually changed here."
"9889790","9892150"," And this is would still be considered a pullback."
"9892730","9894050"," So my bearish. "
"9894190","9894290"," Yeah."
"9894570","9896270"," Is there a warning for risk off behavior?"
"9896750","9898550"," You get get them right."
"9898690","9905970"," There is, but still no confirmation of the of the bra. "
"9910630","9911770"," They don't understand."
"9912170","9913890"," They you know how it goes, man."
"9913890","9916810"," You and I both know that it's like you get the company. "
"9917930","9920810"," And it's like scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream."
"9921130","9924090"," If this is bulls two, man, bulls do this shit like all the time."
"9925010","9926710"," They're like, we'll go. "
"9926890","9928990"," I'm like, have you been long for the past five days?"
"9929510","9931550"," No, you know, you find out they weren't."
"9931590","9935150"," You find out that they were long in the fifth day or the 10th day, whatever it was."
"9935950","9937630"," And so the company is really fucking loud. "
"9938110","9939270"," And there is an actual reversal."
"9941510","9942490"," There's an actual reversal."
"9942610","9943590"," We're actually in there. "
"9943710","9946690"," We're actually selling into these late bears."
"9949010","9953650"," So, you know, for the screaming or whatever, even on Monday, all the screaming that was going on."
"9953830","9956310"," I was like, yeah, you're not getting your 1987. "
"9956650","9960930"," And then matter of fact, in our chat right now, we've got people trying to claim that it's that"
"9960930","9962570"," this is 1987 ish."
"9962870","9967170"," And it's because they need that validation for the claims they were making last week and all that"
"9967170","9968170"," stuff that we're going to have."
"9968730","9970790"," Nineteen seven type crash or something like that. "
"9970990","9971450"," But whatever."
"9971790","9972450"," It's okay."
"9973550","9977550"," I really want to say the one minute trigger can cross above the fire. "
"9977610","9978870"," Yeah, we're watching it right now, brother."
"9981030","9985110"," If it does, I mean technically it does it up along with a stop loss for the five minute trigger."
"9985590","9989630"," Yeah, targeted a 417 49 and a half or so. "
"9990090","9991310"," You got another target up there."
"9992190","9993710"," Four nineteen ninety four."
"9997710","9999950"," Let me see what other questions people have. "
"10000130","10000610"," Let me go back."
"10000830","10001510"," Give me a second brother."
"10008490","10011470"," We're in the VIX might stay up during this time instead of tanking. "
"10011850","10017250"," So VIX could stay elevated, but don't expect VIX to like $30 unless there's something unexpected."
"10017810","10019170"," You guys have to understand."
"10019370","10020110"," It's not just negative. "
"10020450","10021110"," It's not just."
"10021110","10024130"," A matter of being a negative gamma."
"10024810","10026170"," There has to always there. "
"10026350","10029510"," You guys are saying the same thing with up or down on VIX."
"10029670","10029790"," Okay."
"10031010","10035750"," You don't get elevated VIX unless it's an outside of an expected move. "
"10036070","10036210"," Okay."
"10036350","10041870"," So if you've got a one signal move expected and you don't go outside of that one signal move that"
"10041870","10044410"," it's expected already, you're not going to get a VIX spike."
"10045090","10049150"," You can even you can even staircase the market down to the depths of hell and not get the VIX"
"10049150","10049450"," spike. "
"10049450","10054150"," You need outside, outside expected moves that are outside the expected move."
"10055170","10059730"," And right now on a monthly basis, we are expected to bounce off the monthly trigger."
"10060310","10064450"," So if you want that big VIX spike, you're not going to get it unless you break below that monthly"
"10064450","10064870"," trigger. "
"10066170","10067490"," Hold on a second here."
"10067690","10069510"," You have to be outside of your expectations."
"10070510","10072350"," Hey, where can we trade right now, right?"
"10072730","10073430"," Can we trade here?"
"10073970","10075630"," Where is the low probability trade?"
"10075630","10080730"," If we only if we trade that low probability trade, do you get that VIX spike that you're looking"
"10080730","10081090"," for?"
"10087390","10088050"," Black Thursday. "
"10092530","10095310"," How do we get triggers on trade and view?"
"10095570","10096570"," Those are releasing very shortly."
"10096810","10098070"," We're testing them in beta testing."
"10098650","10100250"," We're building in alerts and all of this stuff. "
"10100450","10101990"," It's going to be some time next week or two."
"10102330","10103390"," I think maybe another two weeks."
"10103550","10106990"," I got some devs working on some other stuff in the background that aren't quite done yet. "
"10107870","10109090"," What else do we have here?"
"10113010","10114150"," Yellen's talking live."
"10114670","10115090"," Black Thursday."
"10116990","10118090"," What else do we do?"
"10119830","10120390"," Let's see. "
"10120470","10121630"," Let's scroll through some of this stuff."
"10124510","10126630"," Here's from Trade Moxie."
"10127850","10129230"," This is for you, James. "
"10130390","10138070"," So, Cap is James saying he'd wait to go short at 430 for the daily 29."
"10138410","10141170"," He crosses over the 129 EMA."
"10142070","10143910"," Do you think there's a short here or not?"
"10144630","10146230"," I don't think there's a short right here. "
"10146430","10148470"," I think the short just happened over the past week."
"10148750","10153630"," I think if anything, if the one in the trigger process is about to find the trigger right here,"
"10153750","10161690"," which can't tell just yet, usually I could have a better clue, but right now I honestly don't know."
"10162050","10167230"," Then I think, you know, Spy will start crawling higher, hourly velocity will start repairing and"
"10167230","10169870"," probably on our way to head back up towards the hourly trigger. "
"10170170","10175310"," Of course, stop loss and invalid if price breaks back down below the five in the trigger, but I"
"10175310","10179270"," wouldn't be going short here unless there's a trip back up to the hourly trigger or halfway."
"10180410","10184890"," And then if there's a bearish crossover, one crosses back below the five, then I'd get short again."
"10185850","10188510"," But I don't think there's opportunity to be short anymore. "
"10188810","10190150"," Not this close to the monthly trigger."
"10190470","10191710"," Not with conviction, right?"
"10192290","10193250"," No, not with conviction."
"10198410","10200690"," This one should be right about there. "
"10202450","10205510"," I am curious to see if we get this bullish crossover or not."
"10207090","10210890"," I may be willing to go along if there's a bullish crossover for a scalp."
"10210890","10214170"," Yeah, I actually like today. "
"10214470","10215290"," So a couple of things."
"10216030","10221230"," I love the idea of squeeze into the clothes on Amazon."
"10222030","10224610"," If I was short Amazon, I'd be wrapping them up soon. "
"10225690","10232470"," I'd trade this market up into four o'clock, four fifteen this afternoon for a giant squeeze higher."
"10233130","10235530"," And then we've got some good."
"10242210","10246430"," Yeah, spies going to spies likely going to get the bullish crossover here. "
"10246670","10251730"," So I think for four fourteen fifty possible here, if there's a bullish crossover."
"10256030","10258990"," One second here."
"10264270","10265460"," Dixie rolling over. "
"10265460","10265880"," H."
"10265880","10266140"," Y."
"10266340","10266340"," G."
"10266780","10267460"," squeezing to the moon."
"10267680","10269820"," Vicks blasting to the downside right now."
"10270000","10270660"," Apple recovering. "
"10271840","10272780"," We've got N."
"10272960","10272980"," D."
"10273180","10273320"," X."
"10273480","10274980"," looking like it's making a turn right now."
"10275000","10276100"," You've got it on a one minute chart."
"10276100","10276560"," You've got the. "
"10277220","10281140"," A twenty seven EMA crossing the one twenty nine EMA on a one minute basis right now."
"10281780","10285220"," Price still not following on SPX."
"10286260","10289040"," If you want to talk about you want me to go through some. "
"10289700","10291260"," I don't want to put you on the spot right here."
"10291280","10292680"," You can just say no if you want to."
"10294160","10295340"," But do you want to review?"
"10296100","10296880"," I was going to review. "
"10299260","10300780"," Four tickers for the end of the day today."
"10300780","10301480"," I was going to go over."
"10302800","10303520"," Amazon, Chipotle. "
"10305700","10306940"," Intel and Ford."
"10307260","10308760"," I don't want to set you up."
"10309020","10311600"," Or maybe you take a break and come back and we'll look at him or no. "
"10312140","10313220"," Do they have earnings tonight?"
"10313840","10315140"," Yeah, I think I've got earnings for all four."
"10315320","10316020"," But I give you a break."
"10316100","10318300"," I'll give you a prediction on all four. "
"10318520","10318700"," Nice."
"10319180","10319720"," I got mine too."
"10320020","10320640"," Hold on. "
"10320700","10321920"," Let me get hold on a second here."
"10322680","10323680"," This is going to be fun."
"10324020","10325000"," You give me your predictions. "
"10325520","10326160"," And I'll give you."
"10326300","10328020"," Hold on a second."
"10329080","10331240"," And it's going to be up down and then. "
"10332200","10335540"," And then it'll sell off by morning or hold or whatever."
"10335760","10340640"," That's like the other day I was like I like Microsoft to go up and hold."
"10341040","10344620"," I think that anything on Google is going to get sold even embarrassed on Google. "
"10344940","10345540"," See what I'm going to say."
"10346100","10347180"," So we got Amazon first."
"10350340","10351840"," Okay, let me do Amazon last. "
"10352120","10352880"," CMG said."
"10353320","10354680"," Yeah, we'll do Amazon last year."
"10355360","10358740"," CMG, I NTC, F or Ford. "
"10359300","10360180"," And then we'll do Amazon."
"10360780","10361560"," Do any or anyone."
"10362280","10364220"," Okay, I'm going to go with CMG first. "
"10364460","10370880"," So what I do to predict earnings doesn't always work, but it definitely has a higher than 60% hit"
"10370880","10371100"," rate."
"10372340","10374940"," Check retail positioning and inverse retail."
"10374940","10379260"," So for CMG retail is looks like. "
"10380200","10387600"," Okay, so 106% increase in put buying 41% increase in call buying."
"10387940","10391600"," Looks like they're heavier inputs than calls."
"10391600","10392440"," You go out. "
"10392880","10394680"," I would go long CMG."
"10394940","10395120"," Yep."
"10395480","10396060"," Me too. "
"10396560","10399020"," Now next question on CMG."
"10399260","10404100"," Do you think that any of those lungs would be sold for profit?"
"10406620","10410520"," When I talk about going along for earnings, I sell put spreads."
"10411000","10412660"," But let me see CMG. "
"10413180","10413600"," Yep."
"10413740","10416140"," Do you think that any, any like gains would be sold?"
"10419480","10420340"," Yeah, probably."
"10420700","10421120"," I agree. "
"10422120","10422560"," Okay."
"10422800","10426840"," So I'm with you on that one."
"10427020","10429360"," I'm doing this on my own in the background right now too, because I had it. "
"10429460","10430480"," I was like halfway down through it."
"10431100","10432980"," So price target on CMG today."
"10432980","10438140"," If you're listening right now, upside price target on CMG 1900 into their clothes. "
"10439000","10444220"," That's the expect moving the upside downside expect move 1710 on CMG."
"10444620","10447420"," Their velocity on the daily is looking pretty sexy right now."
"10447420","10449740"," They have a higher low and velocity, believe it or not at this point. "
"10450880","10455680"," Though you do already have a cross on CMG."
"10456160","10459520"," Bares cross daily trigger crossing the weekly trigger."
"10459960","10468020"," Any good news from CMG should still sell the ticker down to 1657. "
"10469400","10470620"," So just heads up on that."
"10470720","10473040"," Well, I'm going to show you guys his charts later in the day."
"10473420","10474760"," But I'm with you on this one as well. "
"10475240","10477300"," Selva news STN."
"10478060","10479080"," But expected good."
"10480160","10481040"," I agree with that. "
"10481540","10482640"," What else do you want to do next?"
"10482640","10483500"," What's taking on your desk?"
"10483600","10490000"," So IMTC, I don't see much in the options positioning, unfortunately, it looks like most positions"
"10490000","10495340"," are closing out, but though it looks bearish, some may go with a bearish view on IMTC."
"10495800","10496540"," I think it'll be sold."
"10497100","10497900"," Hold on, hold on, get here. "
"10502280","10504140"," CMG, it's all the news but bullish."
"10507220","10508620"," IMTC just bearish."
"10512220","10519700"," Yeah, and definitely even if it goes up sell it, okay, what's the next one?"
"10521720","10531940"," So IMTC, I'm going to expect some with you on CMG, IMTC"
"10531940","10535220"," I'm on a week close to $30. "
"10537420","10544780"," You know what, no, I'm on the, yeah, I'm bullish on IMTC to $35."
"10547060","10554000"," I'm actually bullish on IMTC and to their, okay, but I don't think it's sustainable."
"10554240","10555400"," I think it's sell the news still. "
"10556360","10562980"," So actually a few days ago we did this, I do it all the time, but we got, let me"
"10562980","10565100"," see, I'm just growing up to find it."
"10566440","10570000"," We got a bunch of earnings predictions, right, but okay."
"10570260","10570980"," So yeah, we had. "
"10571120","10574760"," There was pretty spot over here, too, dude, we've been like, we've been like nailing them."
"10575160","10581840"," Yeah, Microsoft snap and these are a few days ago for earnings that you got the issue with with the"
"10581840","10587060"," ones that you've told me so far is that none of them had like overwhelming retail positioning"
"10587060","10588020"," towards one side."
"10588020","10593620"," So for example, Microsoft, there was, Microsoft and snap had tons of put selling, which is"
"10593620","10599960"," indication that price would go up on earnings and visa retail was positioned on with puts and had"
"10599960","10600620"," sold calls. "
"10601140","10603840"," So that was an indication to go long, simply inverse retail."
"10605120","10610480"," I want to see if there's any that are overwhelmingly retail positioned into one side because those"
"10610480","10616480"," are the most confident picks, IMTC and CMG, I really just had to go off of Bo X."
"10617420","10621540"," Here comes the cross right now, brother, trying to get this more accurate here."
"10622740","10628080"," Oh, yeah, so, so for example, for right now, again, you want to see the one minute trigger really"
"10628080","10631000"," cross above, but we'll start with that one right here. "
"10631120","10637320"," We'll be able to work with the stop loss below 413, like 15 or so, but we'll see if we"
"10637320","10639000"," actually get the crossover or not."
"10639900","10640940"," Leave that right there."
"10641140","10641500"," So it's less. "
"10642200","10643220"," I think we do get it."
"10643640","10645280"," Well, we're getting along here."
"10645280","10647300"," Yeah, we're probably getting a I'm already a long call. "
"10647300","10648260"," So let's see."
"10648740","10649620"," Yeah, I like it."
"10651360","10655740"," The, OK, so we got CMG out of the way, I and TC out of the way. "
"10657140","10658460"," Let's do Ford next."
"10660020","10664920"," OK, second one second, we don't have the same what we think we do it."
"10665260","10670020"," People I get put on the after you and I get you and I get people they get put on"
"10670020","10670900"," the spot all the time. "
"10671060","10672060"," People are like, what's your prediction?"
"10672640","10675260"," And then they're like, hey, you got one wrong, but they never want to do it."
"10675260","10676780"," I talk about all the others you get right."
"10677000","10678240"," So you can be wrong, man. "
"10678420","10679100"," I don't know."
"10679420","10681280"," I'm just going to give it an honest go."
"10681460","10682280"," Yeah, exactly. "
"10682440","10683520"," Just be honest all the time."
"10685280","10687960"," And guys like you and I have haters everywhere, brother."
"10688140","10689740"," You're going to get haters. "
"10689940","10690460"," It's what it is."
"10691280","10693140"," Yeah, no, it's it's OK."
"10693380","10694220"," I'm just awake. "
"10695160","10696840"," Ford isn't loading for some reason."
"10698720","10699520"," Don't worry, man."
"10699740","10700140"," Take your time. "
"10707360","10708520"," The ticker is F."
"10709160","10710100"," F, baby."
"10710880","10711420"," Foxtrot."
"10712500","10713500"," Yeah, it's not. "
"10714000","10714800"," Not working."
"10715160","10716200"," Oh, I know why."
"10716900","10723240"," There's an issue with Ford because the code reads it as a Boolean, but true or false. "
"10723640","10724700"," When you just type in F."
"10726340","10726420"," Yeah."
"10726800","10728060"," Spy did get the bullish crossover."
"10728780","10731700"," I'm not going to long because I can't pay attention right now. "
"10731700","10736520"," I hate to hate being fucking calls while this is happening because I fucking do the same thing,"
"10736520","10736780"," dude."
"10736780","10738180"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"10738520","10741240"," It's going up and then it reverses on me and I'm fucking the red. "
"10745160","10746120"," So Ford."
"10747860","10748340"," Yeah."
"10748740","10754980"," So I'm asking Justin from New Dev Stocks if there's anything we can do to, um, to check. "
"10755740","10757080"," Because right now there's nothing."
"10759580","10760760"," Ford, I'm kind of."
"10762260","10763340"," Yeah, like Ford here. "
"10764520","10765560"," I think they're going to come out."
"10765700","10766240"," I think they're going to."
"10766360","10767100"," I think they're going to. "
"10767100","10768960"," Some bullish on Ford across the board."
"10769880","10773480"," I'm just bullish on Ford here and I'm bullish because of."
"10776080","10776680"," There's a."
"10777360","10777620"," Now. "
"10778600","10787060"," If the if the talks break down, that's something different, but as of last night, it looks like"
"10787060","10788140"," they're going to try to suck it off."
"10788500","10793760"," We're cracking bears and shit on their on their, um, guidance saying that everything is fine."
"10793980","10803660"," The, the, the end is near on, um, on, uh, even, I don't know if that's true or not, but"
"10803660","10804480"," the UAW strikes. "
"10805780","10806860"," I'm bullish on Ford."
"10807560","10808540"," We'll come back to that one."
"10808620","10810140"," You want to do AMX next?"
"10810840","10811240"," Yeah. "
"10811360","10812520"," I mean, Amazon next."
"10813500","10813900"," Okay."
"10813900","10814080"," Yeah. "
"10815100","10816360"," Some bullish on Ford."
"10817760","10818320"," Amazon."
"10819600","10821640"," I'm bullish on their clothes. "
"10821960","10824100"," I should say this is actually interesting for Amazon."
"10824580","10831160"," So basically there's a hundred twenty seven percent increase in call input selling, but there's"
"10831160","10833940"," also a five hundred sixteen percent increase in call selling."
"10835000","10840860"," There's also a huge long position that was open last week that still hasn't closed a call position"
"10840860","10844040"," and balances move into the propagation zone yesterday. "
"10844840","10848340"," Um, tough call."
"10848880","10849680"," Tough call."
"10850380","10850980"," Yeah. "
"10851620","10854020"," Cause there's, there's very conflicting data."
"10856500","10857100"," Okay."
"10858500","10859040"," What a second here. "
"10859180","10859300"," Yeah."
"10859900","10864340"," The other two, I was able to give one this one conflicting data."
"10864520","10866120"," I don't really have an answer. "
"10867500","10869280"," But with all this call selling."
"10869740","10872220"," I might guess bullish."
"10873720","10874720"," You guess a bullish. "
"10875020","10877780"," Usually, usually just inverse the biggest position."
"10878220","10880440"," So the biggest position right now seems to be sold calls."
"10883060","10885240"," So it's probably, it's probably what I would say. "
"10891980","10893460"," Um, but with no conviction."
"10895920","10898160"," Uh, I'm bullish here on Amazon."
"10901240","10903380"," So you said you're bullish on Amazon. "
"10903540","10904000"," Is that what you said?"
"10904540","10905060"," Yeah."
"10905220","10905780"," Or neutral."
"10906100","10908100"," I said I would inverse. "
"10908380","10908480"," Yeah."
"10909000","10911520"," I said I would inverse the call, the sole call position."
"10912000","10913980"," So yeah, I'd be bullish. "
"10914380","10914680"," You're bullish."
"10914940","10915000"," Okay."
"10916340","10921080"," I'm bullish on Amazon, but I think that it gets trapped in that solven news. "
"10921960","10927460"," I think whatever, whatever it sees, it's by, by, by open tomorrow, it doesn't hold."
"10927460","10928200"," Yeah."
"10928500","10929200"," I wouldn't think it. "
"10929480","10931100"," I wouldn't want to work."
"10932040","10933460"," Playing in any means."
"10933760","10934000"," Yeah. "
"10934060","10937800"," Well, one 30, maybe you could probably see one 30 in the overnight, then."
"10938740","10940940"," Um, I don't think that holds."
"10941000","10943480"," I think it's just a chance to exit the market. "
"10944380","10944820"," Yeah."
"10947860","10948300"," Yeah."
"10948560","10949560"," It's going to get ugly. "
"10950080","10950560"," It's going to."
"10950760","10955540"," I don't think any of that will last, but the others were easier."
"10955540","10959280"," This one, there's again, there's sold puts, which make doing bullish. "
"10959860","10962280"," There's call selling, which makes me lean bullish."
"10962780","10966680"," But there's also a huge call position open from up still open from last week."
"10967380","10968800"," They're sitting on some red. "
"10969400","10972020"," Um, and usually I would inverse that as well."
"10972300","10980060"," So again, the easiest, um, the easiest ones to track are when there's one big retail position in"
"10980060","10980780"," one direction."
"10981060","10984420"," And now we're not seeing that we're seeing, uh, three positions. "
"10984420","10988260"," We're seeing sold puts, sold calls and boc calls and we're seeing a bearish."
"10988260","10988720"," Boats."
"10989180","10992100"," So very tough for me to give a definitive answer. "
"10992820","10996020"," I am right now trying to see if I can get the data on Ford."
"10996260","10997940"," So I will keep you updated there."
"10998420","10999120"," Yeah, don't worry. "
"10999480","11000740"," Uh, I'm bullish on Amazon."
"11001400","11004760"," Uh, but I think that market, when I write bullish, but I think market conditions."
"11005880","11007860"," Uh, market conditions will be. "
"11010440","11013720"," I think market conditions will force selling regardless."
"11013720","11016700"," Uh, in the overnight between today and tomorrow, possibly in the weekend."
"11019640","11021700"," Um, I think it's just an opportunity to exit the market. "
"11021920","11026900"," I think if you're, if you're long Amazon, this is your last chance, uh, to get to exit."
"11027780","11034500"," Uh, so I'm actually, let me say I got, I'm pretty, you know, I'm bullish on all four of these"
"11034500","11034920"," tickers."
"11035920","11037420"," And I'm surprised that I'm bullish. "
"11037600","11044960"," I'm more than likely going to get one of these wrong, but, uh, we've got, um, Uh, no answer yet"
"11044960","11048380"," on Ford from, uh, James, we do have bearish on INTC."
"11049740","11054260"," Uh, bullish on CMG, bullish on Amazon, CMG and Amazon."
"11054520","11058040"," There's caveats of sell the news on both of those. "
"11058340","11061600"," And then, uh, we'll get back with James and so we just say about Ford."
"11063900","11065320"," Yeah, that's what I would say."
"11066060","11067960"," Yeah, that sounds all that all sounds good. "
"11070060","11070740"," Let me see."
"11071000","11072740"," I'm missing some of what's being asked here."
"11080800","11081360"," Oh, yeah. "
"11082000","11083480"," Uh, here's the other thing."
"11083880","11086580"," Uh, hold on, give me one quick second here."
"11088560","11091200"," Uh, I got something I do, James, give me a second, brother. "
"11091760","11092120"," Sure."
"11100110","11102770"," I ended up hitting that long on the trigger cross."
"11103090","11103870"," I just sold in here. "
"11105670","11106970"," Yeah, I'm long right now, bro."
"11107590","11108310"," So I'm good."
"11108890","11110110"," Let's hold it for five percent. "
"11110410","11111590"," Nothing crazy, but."
"11114750","11115190"," Poppy."
"11121920","11123160"," Is live in the show. "
"11125340","11126220"," Any questions?"
"11128260","11130840"," Yeah, I'd expect, um, some resistance right here."
"11131900","11134760"," Four, four, twenty is four, fourteen, twenty is."
"11140970","11142190"," I'm still long here, man. "
"11146790","11148390"," There's, there's this little."
"11149010","11150210"," We're bringing this over here."
"11150790","11151650"," I'm not paying attention. "
"11151850","11157070"," There's, I'm going to move this over for you guys right now because you've got a pullback coming"
"11157070","11157310"," here."
"11158670","11161230"," I'm going to snap some really thin lines here."
"11161230","11163690"," There would be a little one. "
"11164230","11165570"," One yellow."
"11166530","11168130"," Just little marks there."
"11170150","11171750"," There's another one right here. "
"11173670","11174710"," By the way, Cap."
"11175070","11181210"," And just a big thing that's helped with my trading is, is just waiting for a setup."
"11181470","11185190"," Instead of just shorting after a setup, wait till set up. "
"11185270","11188770"," What I mean by that is wait for a beer plane, wait for a trigger cross."
"11188770","11192110"," When there's no trigger cross and there's no beer plane, I just stay in cash."
"11192630","11194870"," And then I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait. "
"11194970","11198210"," And it doesn't matter if I only take one to two or three trades a day, but I like to"
"11198210","11199270"," only take a position."
"11200490","11203810"," Only once there's a trigger cross or a beer plane or something like that."
"11203930","11207850"," Do you like the cross or do you like the reek, the back check to make sure that it's still"
"11207850","11208070"," legit?"
"11208370","11208690"," Can you trade?"
"11208810","11211890"," I like, I like the first high back and then up. "
"11212370","11214830"," I like half on the cross and half on the retest."
"11215170","11216210"," Yeah, that's what I usually do."
"11216910","11217350"," Yeah. "
"11218750","11223890"," And if, and if it's a position that I want to hold for maybe a bit longer, I'll take a"
"11223890","11225450"," call spread on the bullish cross."
"11225730","11230530"," I'll cover the short side on the retest of the five minute trigger, average down on the long side."
"11230730","11233570"," And if there's a break below the five in a trigger, I'll stop out. "
"11233730","11238710"," Otherwise, I mean, again, you're playing statistical odds and untrigger crosses and retest"
"11238710","11241670"," statistical odds tell you it should hold and bounce higher."
"11242450","11247790"," Yeah, I actually had an alert yesterday on meta."
"11248090","11253290"," I think my my by on meta had an alert yesterday on it. "
"11253970","11258610"," Someone's asking about meta right here because I'm bullish on meta into next year."
"11260030","11261210"," Yeah, and I did get it."
"11261390","11262270"," I got a tag on. "
"11262990","11265790"," I got a tag for to buy meta yesterday."
"11267630","11269690"," I'm bullish on meta here."
"11270830","11276950"," Matter of fact, I haven't had a chance to, but if you're someone just mentioned meta in the chat. "
"11277870","11285410"," Did any of you guys, did anyone out there see the new the new meta or James?"
"11285710","11290930"," Have you seen the new meta of VR where it's an exact replica?"
"11291950","11293670"," Yeah, I have seen it really cool."
"11294010","11295950"," And it's not in the uncanny valley."
"11295950","11298630"," It's like it's skirts above the uncanny valley. "
"11298790","11301030"," Like the uncanny valley would be where it's unbelievable."
"11301070","11302050"," It's not believable."
"11304030","11305150"," Not unbelievable. "
"11305590","11306370"," Like, oh my God, unbelievable."
"11306750","11307010"," It's happening."
"11308450","11311050"," Uncanny Valley is when something seems off. "
"11311970","11320690"," A great way to explain uncanny valley is when I tell you if you were to pick up a stack"
"11320690","11323670"," of leaves and you place them."
"11324490","11326570"," On a table on a piece of paper."
"11327310","11329610"," And I said to you, make the leaves look natural. "
"11330690","11333050"," If you were to place them by hand, it would look unnatural."
"11333550","11337090"," If you were to drop the leaves onto the piece of paper, it would look natural."
"11338290","11343830"," So there's like a human hand forcing the idea of something looking natural. "
"11344110","11348550"," But that video to me looks natural."
"11348750","11349610"," It didn't look fake."
"11349610","11352430"," Did it look fake to you or did it look uncanny or no?"
"11355210","11355730"," James. "
"11355950","11356350"," Sorry."
"11356470","11357470"," What was the last part?"
"11357770","11359010"," Do you feel like that video?"
"11359350","11361610"," Do you feel like that video was uncanny or no?"
"11363550","11364950"," No real opinion on it."
"11366130","11370330"," Was it striking to you or scary to you or did it?"
"11371270","11371790"," No. "
"11371970","11374770"," This is technology nowadays."
"11375990","11376430"," Yeah."
"11376430","11380890"," And then did you know about the background of it, how it's being disassembled and then reassembled"
"11380890","11383450"," the signal of. "
"11383870","11389970"," So rather than compressing video to give it like a VR experience, that's compressed video."
"11390190","11396330"," It's sending all this data that then it comes back together and gets reformed on your end like two"
"11396330","11396810"," different ends."
"11397230","11398770"," I guess rather me sending you video. "
"11399710","11401450"," I'm just sending you the data or something."
"11401850","11403190"," I don't know how they explaining it."
"11403190","11405450"," But he explained it. "
"11405550","11408770"," He explained it on a video I watched yesterday and I was shocked by it."
"11410050","11411510"," I'm bullish on meta here, man."
"11412190","11414390"," Into all next year. "
"11415010","11419310"," I'm seeing that for a second because I'll tell you like this."
"11419830","11421650"," The bullets doesn't look bullish."
"11422790","11427490"," But the hedging heat map shows pretty strong purchasing support below price. "
"11427850","11429830"," So I want to take a look at it."
"11430450","11431610"," Hey, I'm going to stop."
"11431750","11434930"," Trust you, they can send you something on this, but I have this fucking feeling. "
"11434930","11435510"," Not a feeling."
"11435950","11436390"," It's from."
"11437390","11438230"," Data, but. "
"11439250","11440010"," Metadude there."
"11440190","11440330"," Like."
"11441090","11442590"," And we were all making fun of. "
"11442950","11444630"," I made fun of VR too."
"11444650","11445710"," And I don't think VR."
"11447570","11448010"," Necessarily. "
"11449110","11453130"," I love the thought that VR is being done much better in Asia, but."
"11453670","11455490"," Watching that video of the day was like."
"11457410","11457870"," Talking. "
"11459770","11460690"," Improvements in."
"11461730","11464250"," All of you guys seen that video listening and find it."
"11464650","11466630"," Seeing a find it for you guys put a link to it. "
"11468650","11470870"," You guys haven't seen the video that I'm talking about."
"11473470","11478370"," By the way, he said currently there's no way to check the data on Ford."
"11479230","11479690"," Unfortunately. "
"11484070","11486410"," Yeah, they can't check the data on Ford as I was saying."
"11486770","11488330"," Tommy said hi, but I hope he's doing well."
"11496480","11497200"," I will. "
"11502990","11510280"," Over here."
"11535000","11537280"," Oh, does Pinterest have earnings today?"
"11538880","11540900"," I don't know if they do or don't."
"11545220","11549960"," I'm trying to build a."
"11553220","11555000"," Do they ever catch that guy from. "
"11555260","11557060"," They ever catch that guy from."
"11558760","11560920"," Main that shooter up in Maine or no."
"11561580","11562480"," Don't think so. "
"11562480","11562560"," Yeah."
"11570260","11572860"," I'll give you guys a link to that meta video."
"11574120","11575060"," No, Lex Friedman. "
"11575340","11576820"," I'm not really a fan of his."
"11576980","11578620"," I don't think that I like Lex Friedman."
"11579900","11582700"," So don't be like, Oh, Captain watches Lex Freeman. "
"11583620","11586320"," I'm not a fan of his personally, but some of you guys might be."
"11587880","11590520"," So don't take it like I'm condoning Lex Freeman."
"11590520","11593880"," This video has more to do with the experience. "
"11594660","11596720"," Now I did watch this entire video."
"11597380","11599020"," I just posted a link to it."
"11599760","11602540"," Into I just posted a link to it inside of. "
"11604460","11606380"," You have the chat for you to click through."
"11606440","11607580"," You can watch it later if you like."
"11608940","11611120"," It didn't delve into uncanniness. "
"11611120","11615020"," If it had Dell Dell, there's two parts of that video that were important to me."
"11615340","11617280"," One, it was not uncanny."
"11617740","11619320"," It looked real. "
"11619320","11625080"," The second thing was the implication for sex porn, believe it or not."
"11626480","11629640"," If you're, if you like that AI hype."
"11630580","11635480"," You're talking about a feeling of literally, if this isn't like. "
"11636220","11637520"," This isn't like."
"11638420","11644320"," This isn't like being in VR and not feeling like you're."
"11644320","11647500"," There's some parts of VR still like not realish. "
"11648180","11652940"," But this kind of VR, it's like, it's like you're standing right in front of somebody."
"11653460","11655900"," Like I'm standing right now in front of you."
"11656180","11658860"," It's very, very scary. "
"11660060","11661780"," It's implications are scary."
"11664600","11670500"," I wasn't a fan of the VR world that he was creating or he pushed or showed prior to, but"
"11670500","11672500"," this one here, man, is to me at least."
"11673740","11679680"," I'm going to, I'm thinking that, that there's going to be some kind of a bit over this. "
"11680940","11684460"," This video that he showed in the coolest part about it was how."
"11685020","11687580"," Instead of compressing video and setting the data."
"11687900","11689120"," It was, it reminds me of. "
"11690100","11695960"," When we talk about space exploration and trying to reach the speed of light and."
"11696500","11698940"," Send humankind across, across the way."
"11700380","11702940"," We have the technology to do it right now. "
"11703320","11706940"," And how it would be done with be with small nano."
"11708440","11710820"," Ships like very small, small, tiny ships."
"11711560","11713620"," And then they rear rather than sending a big ship. "
"11713920","11715260"," I guess the way to describe this would be."
"11715720","11719180"," Rather than having a big starship right that goes across."
"11719980","11722140"," Light speed like you watching movies. "
"11722460","11727300"," You'd send very small particles that would reform once they arrive."
"11728080","11731260"," Once you get them up to light speeds, it's easier, cheaper."
"11732100","11737460"," To get all these smaller vehicles, these smaller vehicles up to speed. "
"11737780","11738920"," Send them where they need to go."
"11739140","11741240"," Then they rearrange themselves and come back together."
"11744140","11746700"," After light speed, very far away from earth. "
"11747100","11751900"," So I think the data, the transmission in VR that he's trying to accomplish is amazing."
"11752300","11755000"," I was blown away by this, by the way, by that video."
"11755000","11756940"," I don't know if you guys were or not, but I was. "
"11760900","11761980"," The video is wild."
"11762300","11764620"," If you watch the, there's two key points in this video."
"11765140","11767260"," Number one is the experience. "
"11767760","11771400"," But number two is how they're going to make that happen."
"11771760","11779360"," It doesn't break, but it circumvents a lot of the problems that we have with compressing one-on-one"
"11779360","11781260"," real-time VR experiences."
"11783180","11785400"," Come back to check the one-minute trigger right now. "
"11792360","11796440"," Yeah, you need the cross for the failure."
"11796880","11797620"," There's no cross yet."
"11799320","11805380"," So the cross for the downside cross, so for the downs, someone's saying they think this is where"
"11805380","11805760"," you're short. "
"11806340","11813920"," You need to see the break of the one-in-five minute, failure of bulls to regain the high, and"
"11813920","11815280"," then you take the short right there."
"11816940","11820240"," But not until, not until all that happens."
"11821020","11824200"," I think upside looks like you might be over for now. "
"11824780","11825480"," Yeah, we got to see."
"11830420","11834140"," So you've got earnings into the close today."
"11834540","11839880"," You've got the risk off warning with the cross of the daily trigger over the weekly trigger. "
"11840660","11842480"," Did you say you had something on Pinterest?"
"11845000","11850360"," Yeah, I wanted to know if there was earnings tonight because I actually love doing this because"
"11850360","11852000"," it's surprisingly accurate."
"11852000","11856060"," Just in-versing retail positioning, but they don't have earnings tonight."
"11858040","11860080"," Are there only four earnings tonight?"
"11860260","11862260"," I want to check for..."
"11862260","11863420"," Hey, I'll list them all off to you. "
"11863520","11863860"," Hold on, brother."
"11864420","11865940"," Okay, let's go through one at a time."
"11866140","11867860"," Okay, somebody can just write them down. "
"11868540","11869500"," I'll go, I'll write them down."
"11869740","11870240"," Hold on a second here."
"11871100","11872320"," I'll go three to one for today. "
"11875000","11879000"," Again, not every time there's retail betting strongly in one direction."
"11879420","11880780"," That's what we need to see."
"11880780","11885760"," If you want me to give you anything with like a high expected move first or I can just go"
"11885760","11887060"," to the list on the top to bottom. "
"11887260","11888220"," You want to go to the top to bottom."
"11888900","11891460"," Yeah, I want to see if it stands out."
"11891720","11892440"," It stands out. "
"11892620","11899700"," Okay, it stands out for huge moves here."
"11901600","11902840"," It's all being confident."
"11906040","11914560"," DXCM, Dexcom, DXCM, DXCM, let's see, because"
"11914560","11924550"," I don't even know if that has options, but it does,"
"11924890","11927670"," but there's not much in the chain. "
"11927890","11928510"," Let me see something."
"11929590","11939490"," So DXCM has a expected move of 11.2%. I bet Bullishly here, just based on Boax again, nothing"
"11939490","11942730"," major in the options positioning, but I bet Bullishly here."
"11942930","11947730"," So that ticker is Dexcom, ticker symbol DXCM. "
"11949730","11957610"," Next one, next big one would be with like, oh, dude, MBOI, mobile I, MBOI."
"11957950","11960210"," Yep, Mike Bravo, Lima, Yankee."
"11960590","11965990"," If I find any that that retails overwhelmingly positioned in one direction, that's, that's the one"
"11965990","11966570"," that I'll take. "
"11966850","11967810"," Otherwise, a big one."
"11967950","11969110"," Do we trade mobile I around here?"
"11969210","11970230"," That's a big one for us."
"11970450","11975990"," That's an Israeli, it's fresh, it said that it's not half the crowd. "
"11981470","11985210"," MBOI, it's got a 9.7% expected move."
"11986230","11991170"," Yeah, unfortunately, I don't have options positioning on this, but I would guess bearish based on"
"11991170","11991570"," Boax."
"11991870","11996230"," Okay, they didn't, you know what, they do usually beat their ERs, but they tend to sell or I think"
"11996230","11997410"," they tend to sell their ERs. "
"11998470","12004010"," Next one, our ARG X."
"12004510","12007030"," So Alfa Romeo, Gamma X-ray."
"12008490","12010990"," Okay, I just want one."
"12011330","12013950"," I just want one where retail is. "
"12014090","12015890"," We'll find one in calls or puts."
"12018600","12020740"," And then I'll go through the heavy headers after this."
"12021620","12024220"," I'm going through the larger implied moves here. "
"12027200","12028720"," Keep scrolling through these."
"12033500","12035960"," Pretty big day today, pretty big release day."
"12036080","12038060"," We got a lot of tickers released in the day. "
"12038460","12041180"," Hey, data is processing for ARG X."
"12044200","12046020"," Let's see if we see anything here."
"12046140","12049840"," Oh, dude, bro, hurts global holdings."
"12051180","12057340"," HTC 14.5%. Okay, I'll do it in a second. "
"12057700","12060660"," Okay, they are again, no options positioning."
"12061400","12063540"," They might not have any options on it."
"12063740","12069920"," Let's go on the ones that people are, the ones that we know that there's lots of options on. "
"12069940","12071020"," I'm going to go through some of those with you."
"12072680","12074420"," I think Hertz might be a big one."
"12074500","12075840"," HTC might be a big one. "
"12077640","12079840"," Oh, I'm just going to go to the top here, ready?"
"12080120","12080800"," H-T-Z."
"12081100","12081700"," H-T-Z."
"12082300","12083420"," Oh, H-T-Z. "
"12087380","12089780"," Yeah, the other two didn't have options tables."
"12090620","12091180"," Let's go."
"12091420","12093240"," Let's just do MasterCard, MA. "
"12095580","12098160"," Okay, this one, they're betting long."
"12099040","12099840"," H-T-Z."
"12100280","12100640"," H-T-Z. "
"12101840","12103720"," Yeah, so I would inverse that in Bet Short."
"12103940","12105100"," Bet Short on H-T-Z."
"12105760","12106200"," Yeah. "
"12107820","12109040"," This is into earnings."
"12109340","12113900"," So the close, when they ring the bell today and you get the earnings report, are we bears or"
"12113900","12114120"," bullish?"
"12115900","12117120"," I would bet price goes down."
"12117820","12119520"," Well, it goes down in their report, right?"
"12119660","12121320"," Okay, so here's the issue. "
"12121460","12122980"," There's also put selling here."
"12123520","12128040"," So there's call buying, which we always want to inverse, but there's put selling and the put"
"12128040","12130160"," sellers are the most accurate in our market."
"12130700","12134840"," So again, not a clean one, but I would still inverse the calls and go short. "
"12137160","12139520"," Let's go to MasterCard, MA."
"12140400","12140400"," MA."
"12142440","12149320"," It's weird because when we did this a few days ago, the majority of options positioning were one"
"12149320","12152060"," directional and now we're seeing so many like mixed. "
"12153660","12154580"," Oh, wow."
"12155400","12157180"," So there's huge bets on this tonight."
"12157500","12161140"," So there's calls, there's sold calls, there's puts, and there's sold puts. "
"12162400","12163480"," Very unhelpful."
"12170910","12171430"," Yeah."
"12171430","12174870"," We'll get to, I see you guys saying in phase, we'll do in phase at one point. "
"12174870","12176570"," We'll get 10 phase brothers."
"12177110","12181670"," I can't believe there hasn't even been one yet, but I'm checking yesterday to see how they were"
"12181670","12183450"," positioned yesterday to see what changed."
"12185010","12191770"," Okay, so yesterday, they were very short with puts and call selling. "
"12192210","12192510"," Yeah."
"12192950","12195910"," They sold, they sold MasterCard by the way already."
"12197030","12198370"," Oh, I didn't even check the price. "
"12198370","12201130"," Okay, so MasterCard's got a tier selling."
"12201970","12204650"," Because they're heavily short, I would bet bullish on MasterCard."
"12205030","12206410"," So I like it too into the close. "
"12206710","12208310"," I like, I like MasterCard today."
"12208450","12211650"," That's my most, that's my largest conviction trade."
"12212350","12213890"," Retail is extremely short. "
"12214550","12215250"," Very short."
"12215610","12221430"," I'm going to go with, and they're probably on that beast of stuff, but I'm looking at it right now"
"12221430","12227570"," and every ticker we've talked about, this goes all the way back to Amazon, CMG, INTC, Ford."
"12228150","12231070"," My favorite ticker here is likely MA at this point. "
"12234790","12237470"," I'm bullish on MasterCard here."
"12238970","12240030"," Are they already reported?"
"12240470","12241250"," No, then I can't."
"12242070","12244570"," Hey, I didn't know that that selling was on their report. "
"12245390","12246110"," They already reported."
"12247170","12247490"," What's that?"
"12248530","12249530"," MA already reported?"
"12250150","12250730"," That's they're saying."
"12251790","12255490"," But what they are right now, like right at this moment in the close, I'm bullish on them. "
"12259430","12260590"," I'm bullish on MA."
"12261570","12262770"," Oh, they did report."
"12263090","12263570"," They already did?"
"12264290","12264770"," Yeah. "
"12265250","12265710"," Yeah, 360."
"12266210","12267410"," This is a buy for me on MA."
"12272530","12277730"," This is, this is their low from May of 2023. "
"12279670","12281810"," March of 2023 is a 342."
"12283710","12286570"," Wow, that bullish trigger cross led to some nice upside."
"12287130","12288210"," Yeah, I'm still long here, man. "
"12289530","12290470"," I'm not up."
"12296650","12299070"," I'm up to $1.40 right now in calls."
"12300890","12303390"," I'm going to come into this first bit right here. "
"12303730","12305370"," I don't know if you guys can see it, but right up here."
"12314700","12318580"," I like, I guess if MasterCard are reported, I like MasterCard here."
"12318820","12319640"," I think it's great. "
"12319820","12320440"," A great buy here."
"12334740","12335960"," All right, I'm flat here."
"12337080","12347020"," And then if you're looking for another dip by here, there's the rest of all this stuff up here"
"12347020","12348540"," to take out this next target appears. "
"12350480","12351360"," 416 41."
"12354600","12358980"," I cut on the first pump and then I wasn't watching after, but I would have added at the five"
"12358980","12359640"," minute trigger there."
"12359800","12365340"," This is just the textbook trigger cross retest of the five minute trigger and pump. "
"12365640","12368120"," They only gave me 60 cents man in that whole fucking move."
"12368940","12369520"," You cut?"
"12370160","12370900"," I caught him cut."
"12371100","12372900"," I'm cut right now, but I'm looking to reenter again. "
"12372900","12373900"," I want to enter."
"12374220","12377480"," I want to buy that one right there if possible."
"12380720","12384880"," If it, if it just runs up there, it runs up there, but if not, it pulls back and gives"
"12384880","12385940"," me another entry I'll buy it. "
"12391140","12393120"," Yeah, I wish I, I wish I would have been watching."
"12393220","12396740"," I would have bought that off the five minute trigger retest because you can have such a tight stop"
"12396740","12397080"," there."
"12397500","12401660"," It's like if you lose, you lose 3% and if you win, you win 20%, 15%. "
"12401660","12405600"," Yeah, I needed to see like, nice cup by the way."
"12405940","12410860"," I needed to see like the failure of bulls here and then I would take the short right there."
"12412860","12413640"," But nope. "
"12414840","12420660"," And now I'm looking for, now I'm looking for this pull back here and the next leg up."
"12422000","12423960"," So there should be another pump here in just a minute."
"12424620","12429740"," Yeah, and like we said before, that was likely going to be the most, the worst hourly velocity"
"12429740","12431780"," print that we've seen throughout this whole downside. "
"12431880","12435600"," So it was hourly velocity has now started per repair."
"12435820","12440480"," So again, you know, once we were at the, once we were at 412 that close to the, to the"
"12440480","12444560"," monthly trigger, the last thing you wanted to do is go short and like we mentioned in stream, like"
"12444560","12449560"," statistically you had way better odds of the trade up to the hourly trigger than down to the"
"12449560","12449980"," monthly trigger."
"12450820","12452680"," And we were talking about entering call spreads. "
"12453100","12455260"," Obviously those would be a nice profit right now."
"12456080","12460320"," And you could have just closed the short side if we headed down to the monthly trigger and closed"
"12460320","12461460"," the whole thing and we sold below."
"12461760","12466740"," So again, like once we started nearing that monthly trigger, that's when I was like, okay, you"
"12466740","12471720"," know, unfortunately, because of the daily trigger cross, like in the macro sense, it looks like"
"12471720","12473220"," there's now going to be a ceiling got 430. "
"12473320","12476280"," But that was definitely not the place to be getting short."
"12477140","12479540"," Yeah, I'm going to look to buy another one here."
"12479540","12479900"," Hold on. "
"12485480","12487540"," Now I'm looking at 415 C's."
"12496280","12498360"," Got the first tag on this first yellow line."
"12498360","12504560"," So when I remove this, got the new high in the previous, we got the new high back here, right"
"12504560","12506100"," here, boys and girls got that one. "
"12506220","12507740"," Now we're trying to tag this one right here."
"12508260","12510680"," And then we're going to tag this one above here after that."
"12515620","12518880"," We should get one more nice fat juicy push up here. "
"12526680","12528200"," Dude, I like it right here."
"12528400","12533260"," Now, like, so now I want to buy a like fuck me, man, like, I want to buy a visa."
"12533260","12534120"," Keep going down. "
"12534340","12535400"," I didn't even check to see."
"12535740","12538860"," Dude, I sold visa like at the fucking top, bro."
"12539580","12541860"," At the fucking top, I bought it. "
"12542100","12542540"," Or spot."
"12542740","12545680"," I mean, sold it like right at the fucking top, dude."
"12547580","12550700"," Well, that dude to 238. "
"12550700","12553160"," I think I sold 240 somewhere in there."
"12553420","12554360"," And I was being out."
"12554640","12554860"," See ya. "
"12555260","12556040"," Thank you very much."
"12557940","12559960"," Well, it looks like it's recovering right now."
"12561260","12563620"," It looks like this is recovering right now. "
"12564920","12566180"," Okay, so we did MA."
"12566580","12569900"," Let's do the, you want to do ENPH next?"
"12570640","12571460"," People are going to be interested."
"12572700","12573360"," Dude, it's tonight, Brad. "
"12573620","12574680"," I didn't know it was either."
"12577380","12578480"," Just heads up that."
"12578700","12581620"," Remember that $740 call spread?"
"12581620","12585260"," I said, trading 780 right now. "
"12586140","12589380"," It was for $740 now trading 780."
"12590200","12590940"," No, 790."
"12591280","12591600"," No. "
"12591660","12592740"," Okay, here's a good one."
"12593140","12593600"," 798."
"12594180","12595300"," So you ready for this?"
"12595440","12600060"," That fucking call spread that was $740 is now trading $798. "
"12602180","12603440"," 800 bucks, basically."
"12605920","12607100"," Look at that call spread."
"12607260","12609020"," I gave a few earlier today on this show. "
"12609080","12610460"," I said, I'm looking to buy a bottom."
"12611260","12613140"," I said, you can put a call spread on down here."
"12613140","12617180"," I said, there are 750, then 740, then 760. "
"12617780","12619580"," They're now trading 799."
"12622100","12623480"," 799 right here."
"12625280","12626960"," Cap, NPH is a good one. "
"12627020","12628040"," We finally got it."
"12628680","12629300"," Let's do it, brother."
"12629680","12633900"," So NPH, they are loaded short, completely short. "
"12635440","12638580"," So they're heavy inputs, and they sold a ton of calls."
"12639160","12642180"," So what we oh shit, I'm on the wrong date."
"12642420","12642740"," Never mind. "
"12642740","12643300"," It's okay."
"12644020","12644640"," I do that show."
"12644920","12647940"," Sometimes I'll click in like SPX and SP will come up. "
"12648460","12649460"," I'm charting SPM."
"12649620","12652280"," I'm like, ah, fucking get the wrong goddamn ticker right now."
"12652520","12654520"," They all look the same anyways, but okay. "
"12654760","12655180"," Never mind."
"12655560","12656160"," They're long."
"12656440","12657400"," They're long intern. "
"12658140","12660660"," Dude, they're in peach crowd is in peach crowd."
"12660820","12662500"," They they're always fucking long."
"12662660","12663680"," They're like fucking testables. "
"12664040","12667040"," I'm accessible, but what's that?"
"12667700","12670700"," I said, I was looking at Monday and Monday, they were positioned very short."
"12673040","12675460"," Okay, so, okay, so I'll explain like this."
"12675720","12680960"," Yesterday, they were positioned completely short, and longs were gone. "
"12681160","12682820"," There wasn't a single long today."
"12684500","12689820"," We see shorts are still in, and the longs came in today."
"12691160","12696840"," There's 232% increase in call selling with this many for positions. "
"12696840","12698740"," I'm going to bet bullishly on the MPH."
"12700910","12702450"," That's a share in MPH, too."
"12703450","12705290"," I'm betting bullish on MPH, too. "
"12705390","12706050"," I'm with you on that one."
"12706370","12713110"," They don't want to see it go though, because if it goes, it's going to fucking move, dude, 114 93"
"12713110","12714550"," 115 on the table."
"12715330","12716090"," I don't know. "
"12716090","12720470"," It's not something I would take a position in right now, but it is something I don't know, man."
"12720630","12722250"," That's this is a snap play, dude."
"12722270","12723890"," This is like a snap. "
"12724690","12725090"," Yeah."
"12725510","12727790"," Yeah, I think there was a lot of trade for today."
"12727790","12729230"," There's a lot of trade for pick for today. "
"12729510","12730710"," I'm going with the MPH."
"12731430","12732330"," Just like a pH."
"12732610","12733850"," Let me let me check something. "
"12735450","12741910"," If there was a lot of trade, that's the one calls are like 400."
"12742670","12747990"," I would go like two or three strikes out outside the money that will help me look right now."
"12748050","12748450"," Hold on a second. "
"12749750","12750770"," It is up today."
"12751110","12751750"," I'll fucking go."
"12752050","12752570"," Hold on a second. "
"12752610","12753330"," I'm down with this."
"12753470","12753750"," Hold on."
"12767320","12768040"," Holy shit. "
"12768180","12769260"," There's no cheap calls are there?"
"12771020","12773300"," $1.28 for 115s."
"12773840","12774760"," I don't know."
"12774960","12776460"," For November 3rd, that's expensive. "
"12780340","12789680"," Dude, $1.15 call for the next expiry on the NPA is 84 cents fucking crazy."
"12790220","12791920"," This is how you guys blow up your accounts, man."
"12792720","12798560"," Even if you are right, fucking like, I'm going to retract my statement on the NPH. "
"12802720","12804660"," NPH is built to take all your money."
"12806140","12807420"," That's reminding me of snap."
"12808100","12809320"," Should it trade 20?"
"12809580","12809660"," Yes. "
"12809940","12810940"," Are they going to let it trade 20?"
"12811320","12811620"," Fuck no."
"12812820","12818940"," They're going to snake your eight, your 70 cents off your 115 target."
"12821260","12821800"," Oh, dude. "
"12821960","12822840"," I missed the spy call."
"12823100","12823300"," Fuck."
"12823580","12824180"," I should have bought that. "
"12824540","12825800"," I should have bought that bounce right there."
"12827380","12833440"," I should have bought that bounce right here on on the one minute on 240."
"12833980","12835880"," I should have bought that bound that candle. "
"12836240","12838260"," I should have bought that goddamn candle right there."
"12839140","12840280"," This one right here, brother."
"12842320","12843860"," That candle right there. "
"12844000","12844740"," I should have bought that candle."
"12866220","12875840"," I'm still bullish here on, let me rephrase all of it again, bullish on ENP, the"
"12875840","12880780"," most that options chain looks like ass."
"12881460","12882420"," I'm sorry. "
"12886100","12889020"," Maybe enter ENPH tomorrow."
"12891860","12893580"," How about another one for you?"
"12893680","12899680"," How about a, what do we have for reports after the bell here?"
"12901360","12908500"," Make sure I put a one."
"12908940","12910320"," You want to try capital one?"
"12911040","12911960"," What's the ticker?"
"12912660","12913800"," C.O.F. I believe. "
"12925230","12930190"," I got a big one for you for tomorrow."
"12932430","12934810"," I shouldn't have bought that fucking, I didn't buy a man."
"12935430","12936410"," That pisses me off now. "
"12945050","12946590"," Maybe you guys long calls here."
"12946770","12947190"," Congratulations."
"12947590","12949950"," We're gonna, we're gonna rip some faces off here in just a couple of seconds. "
"12951170","12954530"," Yeah, 415-14 I think is gonna get hit."
"12956850","12960050"," But that's where I would expect another resistance."
"12965030","12972010"," Data is still processing for C.O.F. The other one that I would ask for today into tomorrow would"
"12972010","12975890"," be, the other big one for"
"12975890","12982030"," tomorrow"
"12982030","12991820"," would be the thing is,"
"12991820","12996060"," XOM for tomorrow, I would have to check the data tonight to see how that works. "
"12996640","12998780"," But I'll show you the text."
"13004580","13014360"," I have a question here in the chat saying, do you think we're bullish on"
"13014360","13014720"," IWM?"
"13015700","13016120"," No."
"13016980","13018740"," We talked about it all day long today. "
"13018860","13027640"," If the market, so SP 500 is gonna be about, S&P 500 is going to be, so willy, SP"
"13027640","13030260"," 500 is like the litmus test."
"13030660","13034340"," Now, I know that IWM can diverge from S&P 500."
"13034840","13037180"," I know that the IAA can diverge from S&P 500. "
"13038220","13047780"," But as long as these conditions persist, any short-term bullishness in IWM would"
"13047780","13057000"," expect to be sold as well as right now, SPI has an expectation of any upside moves to be sold"
"13057000","13057420"," as well."
"13061320","13062180"," Yeah, that's okay, Willie."
"13062360","13063080"," That's the guy I got your brother. "
"13070560","13078980"," By the way, the NPH had perfect bullish hourly divergences before it ripped on Wednesday"
"13078980","13081480"," to Thursday."
"13081860","13082860"," I'm bullish on them today."
"13083040","13087720"," I like that trade up on the NPH. "
"13088560","13092960"," Even if they reported this morning, I like them right here."
"13093760","13095280"," It's like old men stocks."
"13095280","13097360"," Yeah, I have 41515. "
"13097600","13098400"," What's that?"
"13099020","13101340"," I think SPI gets 41515."
"13102380","13105680"," I've got 41541."
"13106460","13112180"," I've got then I've got a tag of 41641 and then a tag of 417. "
"13113280","13117160"," That's where I have like strong resistance 41515."
"13122060","13122920"," But we'll see."
"13123700","13128960"," I wouldn't think it's just going to bust through that so quickly, but maybe we'll see what happens"
"13128960","13129200"," here. "
"13130970","13132150"," Was there any other ones?"
"13132990","13135470"," That just XOM for tomorrow."
"13135470","13137270"," What's today's day to say on it?"
"13138230","13139150"," Okay, I'm checking."
"13140810","13142370"," I'll look to here for tomorrow. "
"13144330","13146130"," That's an S&P 500, right?"
"13146490","13151890"," So oil does well tomorrow should give us an an idea as to what happens."
"13152710","13154130"," I'm bullish on his own here."
"13155290","13156410"," I'm actually bullish tomorrow. "
"13158730","13161910"," I am bullish on on XOM."
"13162470","13164090"," I am bullish."
"13164390","13164590"," Right?"
"13164850","13166930"," I don't think I'd be able to help you too much. "
"13168390","13169710"," I'm bullish on XOM."
"13170590","13172610"," Yesterday they loaded puts."
"13173030","13174130"," Did it go down or up today?"
"13174810","13176190"," I think it went down today. "
"13177610","13178290"," Hold on."
"13179850","13182510"," Yesterday there was a huge increase in puts."
"13183210","13184270"," A thousand percent increase. "
"13185890","13188090"," It's red but barely red."
"13190330","13198350"," Yeah, so they're loaded on puts right now, which would be a bullish indicator for tomorrow if they"
"13198350","13199270"," don't close those out."
"13202530","13204050"," Your bullish or you're not bullish?"
"13204830","13208470"," If they don't close out those puts, I'd be very bullish for tomorrow. "
"13211180","13216040"," I'm bullish, but I think it follows the market down if we reject the daily trigger on SPX or SP"
"13216040","13216380"," 500."
"13217140","13217580"," Right?"
"13226480","13228020"," 2.48 in the afternoon."
"13228620","13230200"," So I'm going to set up some of these. "
"13230560","13231860"," I'm going to set up some charts here."
"13232360","13234280"," So we've got one hour left until the close."
"13234660","13236700"," I'm going to set up some charts in the background. "
"13238660","13247300"," I'm going to set up some charts in the background for the earnings releases after the close today."
"13247680","13253480"," I do need to let you all know that I cannot be here late today."
"13254080","13255320"," I have passed a couple days. "
"13255480","13256460"," I've had some stuff coming up."
"13256900","13260720"," I had to pick up my daughter today and take her to a game."
"13261640","13265060"," So yesterday I was going to come on and stream yesterday at like 11 or something. "
"13265340","13265860"," Then I couldn't."
"13266180","13269660"," It's like I'm getting like my daughter had to go to a doctor's appointment."
"13270380","13273040"," And then like today, I got to go I got to bring my daughter to something. "
"13273400","13276980"," So I got like some daughter stuff that I got to deal with."
"13277080","13282520"," So today I can't stay late on stream due to family family obligations."
"13283880","13287540"," Now I will set these charts up for the close. "
"13287860","13292180"," I'll stay with you guys here at 4 p.m. for the first like 10 15 minutes."
"13292960","13295360"," But then I'll probably leave the stream up and have to leave."
"13296060","13299460"," And I'll have my wife turn the stream off later or something. "
"13299640","13304820"," So I'll try to keep the stream up for you guys for like the four to like four 35 p "
"13304820","13305540",".m. or something like that."
"13307700","13313340"," Now James, can you read the chats or no?"
"13313920","13314400"," No."
"13317420","13318320"," Let me see. "
"13319160","13323060"," While I worked on these on these charts, I would wonder if you could answer some questions."
"13323480","13325640"," Let me see if I can keep you talking here to keep."
"13326080","13327960"," Well, first of all, follow James Rowland. "
"13328100","13332260"," I posted his Twitter handle on Twitter just now."
"13332980","13339660"," It's the top post on top post on my Twitter."
"13339960","13344080"," So if you will go to that Twitter handle, make sure you follow him and see what he's talking about. "
"13344400","13347260"," And James, I'm going to ask you a question from the chat right now."
"13347360","13347520"," Okay."
"13348060","13349460"," If you don't want to answer it, don't bother. "
"13349800","13351200"," But no, please."
"13352260","13354140"," CDX reports tomorrow."
"13354340","13359020"," Can you give any insights on a CD on CDX tomorrow?"
"13359700","13362500"," Yeah, I could give it after market closes. "
"13362740","13364200"," I would need to see how retail is positioned."
"13364540","13365520"," And then I would inverse them."
"13366240","13369180"," But for today, it's not going to be super helpful. "
"13372980","13376180"," It's only going to be helpful when I see tonight's report."
"13376540","13377220"," That's the only issue."
"13377660","13379560"," How about Tesla for right now?"
"13381260","13382740"," Tesla for right now. "
"13383040","13384160"," Yeah, one second."
"13385260","13389840"," As of today, they're all inputs correct."
"13390160","13392800"," So for for CVX, as of today, they're short. "
"13393140","13396040"," So if they hold on to those tomorrow, I would expect upside."
"13397280","13401120"," So look for some upside tomorrow on CVX if they continue to hold."
"13401280","13402180"," If they hold those puts. "
"13402520","13402620"," Yeah."
"13403920","13404720"," I'll shoot you a text."
"13406100","13406180"," Yeah. "
"13406760","13413040"," So Tesla for today was reading in bearish."
"13414880","13415340"," Okay."
"13415540","13419260"," So Boex for Tesla is in the propagation zone, which is bearish. "
"13419260","13419980"," Okay."
"13420740","13425140"," So until Boex can exit the propagation zone, I wouldn't be bullish."
"13427040","13427780"," We do. "
"13427940","13430200"," We do track Tesla every single night."
"13430600","13432080"," Give a prediction for the next day."

"13443840","13449120"," If you go to my Twitter profile right now, so you could look at the first tweet."
"13450020","13454240"," It says MSW uses a combination of six data points to predict future price action. "
"13454240","13458400"," If you want to just go on for one second, I'll just show you how it looks."
"13466260","13468580"," You could bring up Twitter on your screen."
"13468760","13473120"," Sorry, I was in the background doing something else. "
"13475260","13476880"," You're going to go and Twitter and do what?"
"13477480","13478920"," And just go to my last tweet."
"13479360","13479760"," Okay."
"13479900","13480040"," Hold on. "
"13488760","13493560"," I think a lot of your audience would actually appreciate this because it doesn't make it super"
"13493560","13494320"," simple."
"13495160","13496660"," Yeah, I'll bring the silver right now, brother."
"13498340","13499080"," Did we get?"
"13499480","13501420"," This is the post right here, right?"
"13501420","13501500"," Okay. "
"13503820","13507700"," It says at MSW, we strive to help get retail investors."
"13507860","13511960"," No, there's one right under that one right under that one here."
"13516020","13519360"," MSW uses a combination of six data points to predict future price action. "
"13519720","13520120"," Yeah."
"13520280","13521400"," Can you bring that up on your screen?"
"13521680","13521740"," Yep."
"13522120","13522320"," It's on. "
"13522500","13523560"," It's showing to the people right now."
"13524300","13524700"," Okay."
"13525360","13528360"," So why don't you talk about this and while I do some other stuff in the background. "
"13528360","13528740"," Okay."
"13529100","13532520"," So click on to that picture for a second in that tweet."
"13532980","13533220"," Okay. "
"13536640","13538840"," I clicked on the Apple chart."
"13539100","13539760"," Is that what you're looking for?"
"13540120","13540520"," Yeah."
"13540640","13542980"," The one with all the data points, the second picture on that tweet. "
"13544300","13544880"," Got it."
"13545480","13549360"," Trigger is LDPM, VOX, heat map, snapgraphs, op options table."
"13549920","13550320"," Exactly. "
"13550920","13551620"," Hold on one second."
"13553540","13554020"," Yeah."
"13554140","13555380"," If you could just enlarge that. "
"13557710","13558190"," Yeah."
"13558310","13560050"," So that's Apple's movement from today."
"13560050","13560170"," Okay. "
"13562010","13562850"," There we go."
"13563610","13564570"," It's blocked."
"13564990","13565330"," Okay. "
"13565410","13566750"," A little bit of it is cut off."
"13567150","13567310"," Yeah."
"13567350","13569210"," I'm trying to see that again. "
"13570110","13571490"," Is that better like that?"
"13572370","13572890"," Yeah."
"13573150","13573270"," Perfect."
"13573850","13573890"," Okay. "
"13574230","13576590"," So bring a little bit so you can see the."
"13578310","13578830"," Okay."
"13579310","13586270"," So every night we post six data points, triggers, LDPM, VOX, heat map, snapgraphs, and the options"
"13586270","13586610"," table. "
"13587270","13593210"," The main view of what these data points are, so triggers are acceleration levels, LDPM is liquidity"
"13593210","13595570"," levels, VOX measures and equity stability."
"13596310","13602830"," Heat map tells us if price goes to if price goes to X, dealers will be forced to buy shares."
"13603130","13605770"," If price goes to Y, dealers will be forced to sell shares. "
"13606710","13612550"," Snapgraphs give a prediction for the next one day, five day, 10 day, and 20 days, and they have"
"13612550","13614730"," over 60% accuracy for all of them."
"13615370","13617990"," And the options table monitors how big money is positioned."
"13618450","13622770"," So yesterday for Apple, the data print for the triggers was above the monthly trigger, but below"
"13622770","13624030"," the hourly daily and weekly triggers. "
"13624790","13628970"," The interpretation for that is macro bearish while price is below the weekly trigger."
"13629290","13635110"," Then we have LDPM below the data print was below all LDPMs, which is bearish until price can get"
"13635110","13636390"," back above its daily LDPM."
"13636550","13640470"," Then we have VOX, VOX is in the propagation zone, which is bearish until proven otherwise. "
"13641190","13645970"," Heat map unstable and in a gamma squeeze, there is no purchasing support of price falls and IV"
"13645970","13647550"," rises set up for disaster."
"13648470","13649430"," Snapgraphs bearish."
"13649590","13654190"," The snapgraphs are predicting bearish price action over the next one, five, 10, 20 days, options"
"13654190","13655690"," table, shorts remain in their positions. "
"13656050","13658310"," Yesterday, big money is positioned bearishly."
"13658610","13664970"," So all six data points for Apple were bearish, and then Apple today sold $5 straight off the bat."
"13665530","13672390"," So every night we post this chart and then on the bottom, you can see those dots in the box,"
"13672390","13675790"," the bottom, middle box, shorts remain in their positions from yesterday. "
"13676150","13679050"," You can see those little small circles."
"13680030","13683250"," You can click on each one on the website, and you'll be able to see the triggers."
"13683810","13686250"," LDPM, VOX, heat map, snapgraphs, and options table. "
"13686510","13688570"," What it looks like itself so you can check those out."
"13689030","13690530"," This table just interprets it."
"13691170","13700610"," So every night we post this for Spy, QQ, Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Google, GME, AMC, and not to promote"
"13700610","13704850"," myself in any way, but I would say that the hit rate is definitely higher than the miss rate. "
"13705670","13707330"," I'm not giving any predictions myself."
"13707790","13711510"," I just interpret the data and in the writing on the bottom."
"13712170","13718070"," So if you exit this picture, if you exit this tweet, and you scroll down the tweet below. "
"13719010","13719790"," Hello, it's Peter."
"13721230","13723090"," You said exit this tweet, right?"
"13723850","13725670"," And scroll down to the tweet right below it."
"13725810","13725990"," Yep. "
"13732440","13733740"," Let's bring this up here."
"13734200","13736800"," Yeah, so that's how it looks when you get on."
"13737100","13740980"," So Apple data report from last night, everything continues to look very bearish in Apple, and"
"13740980","13742020"," further downside is expected. "
"13742740","13744640"," All data points pointed further downside."
"13744980","13748600"," And then once the daily trigger crux, though the weekly trigger all bounces to the hourly trigger"
"13748600","13751540"," daily trigger can be sold and price will likely head down, although it's the monthly trigger."
"13751760","13756320"," So give the one day prediction, just general macro view. "
"13756440","13758660"," So the first picture is the triggers and the LDPM."
"13759380","13762620"," And then if you click, you can see that purple circle towards the bottom."
"13763780","13767880"," And if you click on the next one, that's what'll bring you to the table that we just showed before"
"13767880","13768180"," that. "
"13768480","13769920"," And the next circle is Moex."
"13770080","13771020"," The next one is the heat map."
"13771340","13773860"," And the next one is the snap graphs. "
"13774140","13775260"," And the next one is the options table."
"13775260","13779380"," So we post that every single night for eight stops."
"13780040","13781760"," And you know, the data is really good. "
"13781920","13787040"," I mean, Captain Kennetest, Boex is very good at predicting future price actions."
"13787340","13788080"," Yeah, I use Boex."
"13788440","13789140"," I use Boex. "
"13789700","13795020"," Yeah, so if this is something that's interested that you're interested in, you could try it out"
"13795020","13800200"," completely free for seven days, and then totally exit the, totally just cancel the free trial if"
"13800200","13800860"," you don't like it."
"13801100","13806800"," It's not something that interests you, but if you're trading anyway, it helps to have a macro"
"13806800","13812100"," understanding of where price is most likely headed."
"13812520","13814500"," And then live trading it is much easier. "
"13814860","13817980"," If you're bearish, then you just wait until price action looks bearish."
"13818200","13820780"," Let's say you get a bearish trigger cross, and then you just get short."
"13821140","13826020"," If the forecasts are bullish, you simply wait until there's a bullish trigger cross, and then you"
"13826020","13826400"," go along. "
"13826400","13834860"," So if you're trading anyway, it helps you with a macro view, and then the live trading becomes a"
"13834860","13839180"," lot easier, because you already know where you're expecting price to go, if that makes sense."
"13839640","13844000"," So maybe something that you guys are interested in, if you are, you could try it out completely"
"13844000","13847280"," free for seven days, and then if you don't like it, of course, you just cancel."
"13847840","13848820"," Never be charged a penny. "
"13849640","13852280"," If you do like it, it's $20, $20 a month."
"13852700","13854740"," So I would like to think that's fairly cheap."
"13855480","13857140"," So yeah, that's basically what I do. "
"13858060","13860800"," The subscribers that we have currently do seem to enjoy it."
"13861780","13866460"," Obviously right below that, if you want to go to the next tweet, you can see the bearish QQ"
"13866460","13867820"," forecast from yesterday."
"13871260","13871860"," Let's see it. "
"13871860","13872020"," Hold on."
"13872120","13872720"," There it is right there."
"13873220","13873480"," Is this it?"
"13874540","13874940"," Yeah. "
"13878980","13879480"," Let's see."
"13879860","13880500"," Hold on, brother."
"13882680","13883640"," Yeah, that's the one. "
"13883640","13884680"," That's the one right there, right?"
"13885320","13889520"," Yeah, so if you can click on that picture, that was the QQ data report from two nights ago."
"13894280","13895740"," Let me click back over here."
"13900160","13903640"," Yeah, so QQ is once again presenting us with a very confusing set of data. "
"13904120","13905280"," Let me take a look at VOEX."
"13905440","13909760"," It appears as the most is trending towards its ability zone, and clearly attempting tags with the"
"13909760","13911100"," propagation zone, which would be bullish."
"13911100","13914860"," The one in five days now, I've seen to do this analysis as well as they're going to be bullish. "
"13915300","13919800"," The issue is that shorts piled in on today's pop and lungs close out half their positions."
"13920460","13922760"," Additional bearish data points is the unstable heat map."
"13922800","13926360"," And the fact that QQ is in a gamma squeeze, my analysis is bearish. "
"13926500","13929820"," As even though it appears that VOEX is losing, it's looking types of propagation zone."
"13930180","13933260"," It currently is in the propagation zone, which is bearish."
"13933520","13938860"," Instead of trying to forecast future, future VOEX movements, I'm focusing on the here and now. "
"13939760","13942800"," And then, therefore, I leave bearish for tomorrow."
"13943420","13945180"," Keep a close eye on the hourly trigger."
"13945820","13949880"," If price can break above the hourly trigger, QQ will like the upside, and may be mostly busy"
"13949880","13950280"," tomorrow. "
"13950880","13955100"," As long as price remains below the hourly trigger, I think we'll see QQQ fall right back down to"
"13955100","13955520"," the weekly trigger."
"13956000","13962080"," So when the day opened up, price was below the hourly trigger, I went short and QQ ended up"
"13962080","13965240"," breaking below weekly trigger and dropped $9 to the downside."
"13966260","13973200"," So again, like the six data points that we use, like when you combine them all together, they do"
"13973200","13975820"," tend to give a very decent analysis. "
"13976420","13978660"," That can be helpful when it comes down to the live trading."
"13979500","13983280"," Spying to you in particular, they usually are fairly accurate."
"13987080","13988140"," Hold on a second here, guys. "
"13989360","13992480"," I got a, was that right there?"
"13995500","14000620"," We'll just leave, I'm going to leave your, I'm going to leave your Twitter up there for the moment."
"14001320","14002640"," I got a one more thing I got to do here."
"14002700","14003900"," I got to do, I got to set up C and C."
"14004340","14005480"," By the way, yeah, I can't hear you anymore. "
"14005920","14006840"," You can't hear me anymore."
"14008480","14009680"," You can't hear me right now?"
"14012490","14013230"," Am I losing them?"
"14013810","14015310"," Oh, there it is, there it is."
"14015450","14016070"," I couldn't hear you. "
"14019060","14020680"," I somehow turned my volume off."
"14021320","14022940"," I'm going to bring this back over here."
"14028820","14032180"," I just got to do, I got to do one quick thing for this close right here. "
"14035560","14041720"," CMG 1915, I'm bullish on this close here."
"14042260","14048040"," I shouldn't be, but I am like, I'm not normally like bullish on all of these closes, but I am"
"14048040","14048460"," today."
"14060460","14061920"," What else we got here?"
"14062980","14063680"," One second, brother. "
"14078720","14080660"," Just set these up for the close here."
"14083360","14086420"," What do you say, James, power hour or sour hour?"
"14087460","14088400"," The next hour."
"14088660","14090500"," I'm trying to look right now. "
"14097120","14098080"," Or sideways."
"14099600","14102280"," I guess sour hour is down, power hour is up."
"14103180","14106020"," So five in the boss, he was good on this pump right now. "
"14106640","14107560"," That's what I would say."
"14108110","14116330"," Yeah, I'm on power hour until like 3.45 and then big red bar down."
"14117830","14122090"," It's like, what is this one, INTCC?"
"14127090","14130470"," What up, like INTCC is such a dead. "
"14135170","14140690"," Like you can't even trade options on it."
"14140690","14142250"," It's such a, such a dead."
"14143830","14146370"," It's like old man, another old man ticker. "
"14152120","14157360"," 3470, 31, 0, 5, do you like the INTCC was?"
"14161480","14168450"," I'm trying to remember that what there's like something to happen with INTCC once."
"14169930","14175130"," And I like pick the direction right, the options right, and squeeze, and it's still didn't pay."
"14175310","14178130"," DIA is like that oftentimes to Ford. "
"14178690","14179990"," Yeah, do Ford really quick."
"14180450","14183790"," It's like one of those ones where you just own the underlying or short or short be fucking"
"14183790","14184050"," underlying."
"14185710","14188590"," Yeah, for Ford, what do we got to do for this one?"
"14191990","14192430"," 1196. "
"14193430","14195050"," Ooh, I'm bullish on Ford too, man."
"14195530","14196610"," Still bullish on Ford in this."
"14197630","14203890"," But even so, man, it just shows like, like these fucking dealers, dude. "
"14204190","14205150"," This is another route to Taylor."
"14205150","14209070"," There was such a beautiful trigger cross, retest, and explosion to the upside."
"14209410","14211270"," Like this is just textbook trigger. "
"14211770","14212070"," Textbook, bro."
"14212430","14213230"," Textbook, brother."
"14214030","14214610"," Textbook. "
"14214970","14221090"," And you know what's crazy here too is the dealers have the downside covered on Ford."
"14221470","14222810"," Now they're going to grab the upside."
"14228250","14230470"," I do see a stat on your thing. "
"14232730","14237030"," I do see, I recently signed up for MSW, I moved to Pate's up because I find the data James"
"14237030","14238210"," provide to be great value."
"14238570","14239350"," Thank you very much."
"14239550","14240270"," Oh, that's awesome. "
"14240630","14241250"," Appreciate that."
"14241410","14244890"," And then I see another one having you both been saying any rip is we're selling."
"14245330","14248270"," Yeah, but we set up the hourly trigger or at the daily triggers. "
"14248610","14251770"," So the hourly triggers at 419.25 right now."
"14252690","14255490"," So if we get there, that's where I would try to sell again."
"14256950","14262190"," And if not, if there's a bearish trigger cross, which means that the woman in the trigger crosses"
"14262190","14267230"," back below the 5-minute trigger, I would possibly pick that short again as well, although it may"
"14267230","14270950"," just be like a choppy move down. "
"14271830","14276050"," But yeah, I do think balances are worth selling, but only at the hourly trigger."
"14277170","14282870"," Because the hourly triggers below the weekly trigger, we expect the hourly trigger to provide"
"14282870","14283330"," resistance."
"14283370","14287110"," So when the hourly trigger is above the weekly trigger, we expect it to provide support. "
"14287950","14292190"," So when the hourly trigger is above the weekly trigger, I like to buy dips at the hourly trigger."
"14292970","14300250"," And when the hourly trigger is below the weekly trigger, I'm looking to short pops to the hourly"
"14300250","14300470"," trigger."
"14302510","14305490"," All right, so we got the expectations here for the close. "
"14306830","14308390"," I got Fords up here."
"14311310","14313050"," I think that one right there."
"14313290","14313970"," I got a run cap. "
"14314850","14316910"," Yeah, I don't want to say number one."
"14316950","14318650"," You've been here for two hours, brother."
"14318810","14319710"," I appreciate you being here. "
"14319810","14321550"," Hour and a half, two hours, you've been here."
"14321850","14322910"," I love being here."
"14323030","14324210"," Fucking love having you here, bro. "
"14324410","14324690"," Always."
"14326190","14330190"," This is the place for you, by the way, to take some money off the table as we squeeze higher,"
"14330850","14332390"," and see that supply on book map."
"14333230","14335610"," How do you fall in love with any long trades?"
"14336090","14337770"," No, no, no, this is where you take the money right here. "
"14339150","14342750"," You can see that you can see that this little band right here."
"14342970","14343170"," Hold on."
"14345670","14347610"," It doesn't mean we can't continue to squeeze higher. "
"14347750","14348470"," We'll take a look and see."
"14348630","14350110"," Yeah, there's some more supply higher."
"14350410","14351350"," So we can go higher here. "
"14351890","14353550"," You want to see if this one minute trigger holds."
"14353590","14355390"," We can squeeze, believe it or not, higher."
"14358310","14362370"," So you want to see the back test of the of the one minute trigger and see if it holds. "
"14363350","14365790"," If it holds, we can get some more continuation to the upside."
"14367330","14369350"," Oh, yeah, James, I appreciate you stopping in, brother."
"14369810","14370750"," Good to have you here today, man. "
"14370750","14371610"," Thanks so much for having me."
"14371790","14372070"," Yeah, man."
"14372150","14373950"," I'll talk to you soon and have a great fucking week. "
"14374130","14375870"," It's not Friday yet, brother, but have a kick-ass weekend."
"14376610","14377310"," You too, man."
"14377510","14382350"," And everybody watching have a great weekend and see you guys next time. "
"14382570","14383110"," All right, let him in."
"14383830","14384450"," All right, bye."
"14384630","14384750"," Bye. "
"14385610","14386610"," Oh, what did I do here?"
"14387430","14388750"," I got to close the meeting."
"14390970","14393450"," Hang up the meeting in the call for everybody."
"14396010","14396890"," Close that one up. "
"14396970","14400010"," We've got the traditional charts on the bottom side."
"14400210","14406250"," I did chart them out for their anticipated upside and downside moves."
"14408330","14414090"," So we'll look for, we'll look and see what happens after the bell on these reports. "
"14414510","14416110"," I've got set up for after the bell."
"14417450","14423230"," Ford, Amazon, ENPH, CMG and INTC."
"14428000","14432780"," At the end of the day, I just took one and made some decent money. "
"14433660","14435520"," There was a second spy trade."
"14437100","14444920"," So if you're looking for a spy trade into the bell, if you're looking for a spy trade into the"
"14444920","14453200"," bell for earnings, I would like to see some kind of a quick rip down to buy some calls."
"14453660","14462840"," So you'd open up a spy call chain and when they manipulate that last 10 minutes, I would love to"
"14462840","14468780"," see a pullback on spy down to 413-93. "
"14469340","14472240"," So open up an options chain, right?"
"14473160","14475340"," And start watching that options chain."
"14475340","14479860"," So something that's in the money right now down at 413-93."
"14480520","14489900"," You might be looking for like a, I didn't buy any heads up, I didn't buy any ENPH. "
"14491860","14494980"," That fuck at the price of ENPH is out there out of their fucking minds."
"14495300","14498140"," I would only ENPH here, but not the options."
"14499040","14500240"," The options are just stupid. "
"14503650","14506070"," There's like, there's calls and puts just sold everywhere."
"14510690","14520160"," So an idea here would be, so 413s are $2.39 right now, okay?"
"14521060","14530880"," So for spy 413, sorry, $4.14 or $1.41 and for 13s or 232."
"14532080","14537380"," So I would keep your eyes on those two on those two on the close, right?"
"14538000","14542340"," And if you can see those options just like slam down to like 30, 40 cents. "
"14543560","14553560"," Jump on those bad boys for the the inevitable squeeze higher, the inevitable squeeze higher on,"
"14553740","14555240"," oh, sorry about that."
"14555660","14557820"," The inevitable squeeze higher on the close."
"14560800","14564940"," And you already know you're going to get panic selling around 345T. "
"14565080","14571060"," You should normally get like big fat red barred out on all these reports and then a continuation"
"14571060","14572140"," after the VEL."
"14577820","14582700"," Does anybody get a long XOM, XON mobile into tomorrow?"
"14582940","14587600"," I'm fascinated to find out if any of you oil traders out there are going to trade XOM into"
"14587600","14587960"," tomorrow."
"14597380","14602040"," You're an amaniac for trading, hold on, I'm trying to read this missing stuff here. "
"14602180","14606820"," I'm an amaniac for living, trading, M-phase, made my biggest swing trades with M-phase."
"14609200","14611640"," Yeah, no hold on the one minute trigger here."
"14611900","14613760"," Going back down to check the five minute. "
"14615260","14616460"," Here's S2 right here."
"14619200","14623040"," And I'm looking for a pullback right now on Spy to be ready."
"14623920","14625000"," 413-93. "
"14631320","14633400"," 413-93 is what I'm looking for."
"14642190","14648110"," So somewhere right here, this is where my interest is, somewhere right there."
"14674100","14675600"," Notice the waiting game into the close. "
"14676440","14678820"," Thanks for joining us today, I appreciate you guys being here today."
"14679400","14681980"," And we had James Rowland on earlier."
"14682180","14684180"," Want to say another thank you to him for coming on the show again. "
"14684220","14687980"," You guys know that we've known James for multiple years here."
"14688840","14693100"," So hopefully he gave you guys some insights what he thought and what would happen."
"14693560","14695920"," And then you've got my thoughts on what I think happens. "
"14696200","14698220"," I actually think we get good reports across the board today."
"14700120","14707260"," Although saying that, I'm sure if I make four, if I say four tickers are bullish into the close,"
"14708100","14711260"," five tickers, I'm bullish on NPH2."
"14711380","14714380"," So I'm saying five bullish into the close. "
"14714680","14720740"," I shouldn't, my brain is telling me don't tell people that because you're going to be wrong."
"14720920","14726120"," You're not going to get five bullish ER reports across the board."
"14726340","14730680"," You're like statistically I'm going to be wrong in this one, but that's what telling me to be. "
"14730680","14736960"," So I am long in my thesis on these five tickers into this bell today."
"14739100","14743840"," Now saying all of that, I'm sure one of you are going to come back and be like, well, I"
"14743840","14745900"," got four out of five, but that one of you got wrong."
"14746760","14747980"," Let's burn them with the steak. "
"14748220","14751120"," Somebody get the shovels, get the gasoline out, let's burn them."
"14753420","14755560"," But you guys know we're pretty weak."
"14755700","14756920"," You guys know we nail these things. "
"14756920","14758280"," So you guys are already here."
"14758280","14763120"," I already give you guys my expectations on all of these ER reports, and we fucking nail them."

"15031690","15034450"," Now, so we've got non-farm payroll Friday 8.30 in the morning."
"15034870","15036110"," U.S. unemployment rates."

"15055090","15057670"," So a big, big volatility on Wednesday Friday. "
"15058190","15062650"," If you're really looking for that volatility spike to 30 bucks, you know, that's that opportunity"
"15062650","15065930"," for it next week on Wednesday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"15066150","15067430"," And not so much there."
"15067790","15070190"," Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Wednesday. "
"15071750","15073890"," And say, yeah, somewhat on Tuesday in reality."
"15074550","15079950"," The biggest volatility next week is Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday."
"15081450","15082450"," What else we got here?"
"15082590","15083190"," I think that's it. "
"15083470","15084770"," So I got the news out for tomorrow."
"15084910","15086370"," We got the news out for next week."
"15086590","15094590"," So a little lapse in volatility into or late Friday into Wednesday-ish of next week. "
"15099250","15100290"," Yeah, they don't mind inflation."
"15100810","15101410"," That's what I think."
"15101710","15106670"," I think, you know, the thing about inflation to me right now is what's really right in my ass here"
"15106670","15116570"," is what's really right in my ass here right now is the inflation scam that's going to come down"
"15116570","15116950"," the pipe. "
"15118130","15120450"," You know, hey, I can already see it."
"15121050","15130210"," I can already see that we beat inflation like a mission accomplished, like Jerome Powell sitting on"
"15130210","15131030"," an aircraft carrier."
"15131130","15134770"," He's got yelling next to him and they're like, we beat inflation. "
"15136850","15140070"," And meanwhile, inflation is just fucking raging."
"15141210","15147630"," And, you know, it's going to or the moment they're done with that proclamation, inflation is going"
"15147630","15148470"," to take off again."
"15149610","15152050"," And but you already know inflation's here, right?"
"15152190","15153630"," You and I, I see it everywhere. "
"15154450","15154990"," I see it."
"15157390","15161070"," Everything that I'm like, you guys think you see it, right?"
"15161070","15168890"," I see it in like tens of thousands of dollars in another aspect of my life."
"15169130","15172190"," Like my, the Airbnb shit, my taxes, my fucking house. "
"15172190","15173830"," I own my kids."
"15174230","15175110"," Like it is glaring."
"15175730","15179070"," When I go out to dinner and I eat out with my family a lot, right?"
"15179730","15182370"," It is, dude, when I go out to eat and it doesn't matter. "
"15182590","15183930"," The food quality is going down."
"15184290","15190730"," You're talking like, like a local restaurant with my wife and kids."
"15191070","15192970"," Two, three hundred dollars. "
"15193430","15195690"," Nice restaurant, four, five hundred."
"15197750","15201070"," Do we just, I just did a fucking vacation this past weekend."
"15201390","15205770"," My wife, dude, and my kids just went to see family. "
"15206770","15208230"," That shit ain't cheap, dude."
"15208590","15209770"," It's just not cheap."
"15210130","15211310"," Like these aren't like big. "
"15211470","15215350"," These aren't like the year long, like every year, like I'm going to take a week and I'm going to"
"15215350","15215850"," go to Disneyland."
"15216430","15219250"," Like these are like every weekend trips that we're doing."
"15219690","15220290"," We're going here. "
"15220290","15220910"," We're going there."
"15220990","15223250"," That shit is like thousands of dollars."
"15223990","15225650"," Thousands of dollars, boom. "
"15226210","15230610"," Now the cost of living right now for me at least is out of fucking control."
"15230830","15231710"," I got to be honest with you."
"15232050","15237390"," Out of control, thousands, blowing thousands every week. "
"15242680","15246200"," So when they say inflation's down, I'm like, there ain't no goddamn way."
"15246300","15247680"," There ain't no fucking way."
"15247820","15249880"," They're lying their asses off. "
"15254970","15255910"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"15255910","15256770"," I agree with stretching walls."
"15257030","15257930"," I agree a hundred percent. "
"15260450","15261270"," No, you know what?"
"15261410","15262210"," I got to be honest with you."
"15262330","15263610"," I got to say something about Michelin restaurants."
"15264110","15265230"," I want to say something in that topic. "
"15267770","15273510"," Last week, I went, I'm not going to name the restaurants, but so here's a story for you."
"15274590","15282550"," So last week I went to, so Detroit is known for its Detroit style pizza."
"15283130","15290110"," And there's like four restaurant bars that claim that they created it. "
"15290430","15296630"," There's about four that like say, hey, we created this pizza."
"15297090","15307090"," Now those bars of those four places, if you go there for dinner, right,"
"15307090","15315650"," I could usually get out of there spending about 80 to 100 bucks with tip, maybe one 20 if I"
"15315650","15316430"," was feeling generous."
"15317690","15320850"," That included food, drinks, or four people. "
"15322770","15327670"," Now I haven't been back to one of these pizza joints, those four pizza joints."
"15327670","15329030"," I haven't been back in a while."
"15329930","15331390"," It's been a, it's been some time. "
"15333330","15339350"," Now that price tag for my wife, myself, and two daughters is reasonable."
"15340370","15349410"," So if I go to, if I go to a McDonald's type, uh, fast casual, not casual, like this is"
"15349410","15350970"," a casual restaurant, these pizza places."
"15351450","15355850"," So like if I go to a fast food restaurant and I can get out of there spending about 10"
"15355850","15358810"," bucks on average, roughly $10 per person, I'm happy. "
"15359250","15360110"," So 40 bucks."
"15360690","15361130"," Awesome."
"15361850","15363030"," That hasn't been happening. "
"15364210","15369510"," This would be considered like a local casual restaurant that has full service."
"15370470","15371870"," So I went there two weeks ago."
"15372130","15374370"," I think it was two could have been longer, but I think it was two weeks ago. "
"15375290","15381190"," And now this is a place that I used to eat out with my family frequentlyish, maybe once a month,"
"15381810","15383070"," then I haven't been going."
"15384350","15392630"," But I went there, uh, on a lark recently, now I wound up there for dinner with my wife and"
"15392630","15392950"," children."
"15394550","15397390"," And we walked inside and I'm going to tell you what changed. "
"15398810","15399630"," I went inside."
"15400690","15402150"," This is now this is not the peat."
"15402230","15403350"," This is not the bowling alley story. "
"15403470","15404150"," This is a different place."
"15405170","15405750"," I go into this place."
"15405890","15409650"," This is like well known, been there for fucking 100 years, all this other stuff. "
"15409770","15412910"," I go inside, um, I get sat down."
"15414770","15416410"," I get sat down, right?"
"15419150","15420890"," The servers didn't care."
"15421390","15425150"," I didn't know why originally, but the servers didn't care. "
"15425830","15427630"," They promised me a bunch of shit."
"15427890","15428470"," Never brought it."
"15428950","15429790"," Never brought it. "
"15429910","15430510"," Just didn't show up."
"15431070","15433010"," So I had to keep asking, hey, you're missing this."
"15433170","15434770"," You're missing my fucking bear. "
"15435370","15435810"," Literally."
"15436770","15439850"," You forgot the water that I asked for."
"15440070","15441010"," Then the food came out. "
"15441690","15443050"," It wasn't that good."
"15444030","15447010"," There was no care put into the preparation of the food."
"15447150","15447570"," There was no care. "
"15447670","15448070"," Nobody cared."
"15449350","15450730"," So we did that."
"15452390","15455510"," And we get done with dinner and all done. "
"15456090","15457850"," And the server brought me a check."
"15459310","15467670"," And the price I think was 180 or 180 plus the taxes was like 200."
"15469250","15470270"," No, no, it was less. "
"15470270","15471410"," It was like 190 or something."
"15471550","15472210"," It ended up coming out."
"15472230","15474870"," It's like a $30 tip or something, like 20%. "
"15477430","15478990"," So I get the bill."
"15479710","15481170"," I get the bill, right?"
"15482090","15486290"," It's like a it's like a 220 or something like that."
"15487050","15492610"," I get the bill and I notice the tip on it. "
"15493490","15496450"," Now my wife didn't think that I noticed the tip on it."
"15497070","15503030"," And she said something to me in the effect of did they put 20% on or not."
"15503730","15505910"," And it was 18 that they put on the bill. "
"15506270","15508810"," So they auto build me the tip."
"15510490","15512570"," Now it was listed in the menu."
"15513170","15514050"," I didn't see it. "
"15514270","15515470"," I did see it on the bill."
"15516210","15518410"," My wife thought I didn't see it was going to double tip."
"15518570","15519450"," I didn't double tip. "
"15519710","15521750"," But she then wanted to tip an extra 2%."
"15522290","15524790"," Well, I didn't want to even tip the 2%."
"15525270","15527330"," And I did do the 2%. "
"15527330","15530910"," And then I waited until after all this asked my wife."
"15531130","15533810"," And she was like, well, I saw that it was 18."
"15534090","15535270"," I want to make sure you weren't double tipping. "
"15535270","15536950"," And then I wanted to make sure they got an extra 2."
"15537290","15537850"," I'm like, OK."
"15539910","15543230"," Now I wouldn't have tipped the 20."
"15543930","15545850"," I would have probably left zero. "
"15546810","15547790"," I was angry."
"15548730","15550050"," And I would have told them to."
"15550210","15551930"," I would have said I'm leaving you zero. "
"15551930","15552710"," I'm going to tell you why."
"15553430","15556850"," Now I don't normally leave zero for a tip ever."
"15557630","15563150"," But I noticed that in what it reminded me of was I've been to Europe a lot. "
"15563770","15564970"," And I've eaten in Europe."
"15565810","15570770"," And the service was reminding me of eating in Europe."
"15572010","15574730"," And I'm not going to fucking tip if that happens. "
"15575290","15576310"," But I'm not leaving anything."
"15576750","15576910"," Zero."
"15578070","15578790"," No 18%. "
"15578790","15580430"," You can raise your prices up all you want."
"15580590","15582130"," Now I noticed something in this eating thing."
"15582650","15585110"," One, the pricing was through the fucking roof. "
"15585470","15587790"," On the food, drinks, and everything else we had."
"15588510","15589170"," I had a shot, I think."
"15589670","15591330"," Picture of really nice bear expensive bear. "
"15591910","15593890"," Some great food, great dessert, all that kind of stuff."
"15594110","15595310"," But it was very expensive."
"15596490","15597530"," So here's a deal. "
"15598450","15600130"," You're I'm going to tell you something, OK."
"15600390","15602970"," I go out to dinner and you're going to hit me."
"15604070","15606630"," And you're going to hit me with the food increases, right. "
"15607590","15609430"," And in a required 18% gratuity."
"15609810","15611910"," You might as well just make it flat across the board."
"15612510","15614090"," I don't want to I don't want any bullshit charges. "
"15614090","15619670"," I don't want I just want you to make the fucking pizza to $40, right."
"15620070","15625690"," Don't give me a forced 18% gratuity any of that kind of shit, just like just build it into"
"15625690","15627890"," your menu and then just say don't tip."
"15628730","15632550"," Now when you're showing me that it's required tip, this wasn't a party of eight or as party of"
"15632550","15634770"," four, right. "
"15634910","15641570"," Now, saying all that the other thing that rubs my ass wrong is you could see the no care."
"15641570","15645270"," And I didn't know this is a required tip at this restaurant that they'd changed their policies."
"15645810","15649310"," But I could tell the difference that people are just like, I don't give a fuck. "
"15649630","15650990"," I wouldn't give a fuck either."
"15651450","15656050"," If I have an 18% built in service charge or to any whatever you want to call it."
"15656530","15658710"," On my meal, I'm not going to care. "
"15659410","15662870"," I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to take your order, get it in, get it to you as"
"15662870","15664150"," fast or not as fast."
"15664650","15667810"," And I don't have I don't have any sword to live or die by."
"15668190","15672870"," If I forget your beer, if I forget your salad, if I forget your water, what the fuck do I"
"15672870","15673170"," care?"
"15674230","15676910"," My care ends after you place your order. "
"15677130","15679830"," Furthermore, I should get your entire order, right?"
"15680170","15681030"," Not part of it."
"15681410","15684310"," I should be getting all your drinks, all your food, everything you need."
"15684850","15687890"," I don't care about your desserts and they need to turn your table out, right?"
"15688450","15690110"," So that I can get the next table to sit down. "
"15690210","15692550"," I'm getting 18% regardless of the food is good."
"15693150","15695250"," If it looks like shit, so the server sends it back."
"15695910","15699090"," Or if they fucking forget, if they forget the fucking condiments or whatever. "
"15699090","15700630"," And that's fine if we're going to do that."
"15701650","15703250"," That's fine if we're going to do that."
"15703870","15705890"," But if we're going to do that, right?"
"15706210","15710530"," That means I have an expectation of shitty service, shitty food. "
"15710910","15713210"," And that's what you get in Europe, generally speaking."
"15713870","15719850"," And what's crazy is someone just said something in the chat about Michelin restaurants and it made"
"15719850","15723810"," me think of Michelin restaurants and James Beard restaurants."
"15724750","15733790"," And what it made me think was just like Europe here in the States, if we're making that fundamental"
"15733790","15739030"," change where I'm not ever going back to this fucking pizza joint. "
"15739510","15745770"," So if I used to spend 100 bucks a month or whatever at this joint, that's not a ton of"
"15745770","15747210"," money, but it's 1200 bucks a year."
"15747990","15749730"," And I tell people I like going there."
"15749930","15751250"," I tell everybody, hey, go to this restaurant. "
"15751350","15752770"," It's the best Detroit style pizza."
"15752770","15755230"," I will no longer tell people that."
"15755510","15757490"," I will no longer die in there. "
"15757770","15767390"," And to that point, for the huge upcharges at this restaurant and food and service, and the lack of"
"15767390","15770370"," service, that's part of what the charm of this place."
"15770830","15776570"," Like part of the charm of this place is that they sell some of the best Detroit style pizza."
"15776930","15779430"," They didn't that night, no one cared, including the cooks. "
"15780270","15782530"," The service was normally good in this restaurant."
"15782930","15784290"," The service sucked in this restaurant."
"15785390","15790290"," And then the cost of it all combined together for me, guess what I left that restaurant telling"
"15790290","15790670"," myself?"
"15791090","15793610"," And the reason I'm saying this is because someone just mentioned this. "
"15794050","15796990"," And when I was done in a paying 230 bucks, and you know what I said to myself?"
"15798110","15804370"," I could have went into a fucking James Beard restaurant here, eating two or three small plates with"
"15804370","15804990"," a bottle of wine."
"15805090","15808830"," I could have brought my own bottle of wine in with my wife and kids in a beard house."
"15809550","15814970"," Now James Beard house, I could have went in there, got some tasting menu or some kind of"
"15814970","15821690"," appetizers, brought a bottle of wine, get the cork and tree, and be on my fucking merry way for"
"15821690","15824370"," like 300 bucks with my kids in tow, maybe 400. "
"15825510","15830430"," A full meal at one of those restaurants right now, Detroit's costing me on the cheap end, about 120"
"15830430","15833090"," to 200 bucks a person."
"15833850","15835610"," So I was a little flabbergasted."
"15836330","15842890"," It's making me watch now, like this experience I just had is making me want to, instead of pissing"
"15842890","15850430"," money away on fast food or casual dining, just go to just go to a beard restaurant or a Michelin"
"15850430","15855610"," restaurant and just dine it really nice places, just like high-end shit. "
"15856070","15860270"," If you're going to real, I don't mean high-end, you might have a thought of high-end restaurant"
"15860270","15865290"," being like a, well I don't fucking know, what's that steakhouse everybody goes to?"
"15869470","15873950"," Like your idea of a high-end restaurant is probably different than mine, but my experience, I eat a"
"15873950","15879450"," lot in beard restaurants and Michelin restaurants, you can find some really fucking good ones that"
"15879450","15881370"," are very reasonably priced."
"15882450","15890830"," And there's this like, there's this like, they're like getting so close, right, in cost that in"
"15890830","15893070"," service, I know will be better in these restaurants."
"15893710","15898590"," So I'm myself, I'm in this, oh dude, we just came back out of my green box. "
"15898990","15899990"," Here's my green box, baby."
"15901570","15912390"," Myself right now, my self on my restaurants, what I'm doing with restaurants is, I'm"
"15912390","15917610"," like, dude, I've cut out all the fucking fast food, I've cut all the fast casuals shit, I've cut"
"15917610","15919190"," out even breakfast."
"15919490","15922470"," Oh no, I had breakfast at a nice place, it was cheap place this past week. "
"15922990","15927310"," On Sunday, we had a great, oh no, last Sunday had a great, great breakfast that was cheap and"
"15927310","15927770"," reasonable."
"15928770","15935830"," An old place I haven't been to in a long time, but I'll tell you what, man, like if you"
"15935830","15943270"," want me to spend money, I'm down to spend it, but we're moving on up on our, on our like,"
"15943510","15947210"," like when we just, like at nighttime and I'm like, hey, let's go out to dinner."
"15948250","15952290"," Now it's like, let's find a fucking nice, like, let's find a nice cafe that's like a, a big"
"15952290","15957690"," quality, you know, it's not like, let's go down to the local pizza, famous pizza joint or whatever. "
"15960360","15968500"," So here, here where I live, breakfast got out of control, brunch got out of control, and now my"
"15968500","15970660"," local breakfast joint is now reasonable again."
"15970660","15972300"," So now we are going there."
"15972380","15973600"," I did have a great experience there. "
"15973640","15974220"," I was very happy."
"15975920","15977460"," Let's see if we can buy this or not."
"15979060","15980440"," In a second here, we'll take a peek. "
"15989630","15990870"," No buy from you right now."
"15995810","15999930"," A little bit of a roll here in CMG, a little bit of a roll here in INTC."
"16002310","16007870"," It looks like the ENPH just parked right now, Amazon parked right now, no dip buy for me. "
"16008310","16011450"," If they can bleed this down a little bit more, I'll wait until the close to get some zeronakes."
"16012930","16015870"," Ford trying to hold itself up actually the best of all of them right now."
"16019080","16020620"," You know what I did watch this week too?"
"16022240","16023740"," No, or two weeks ago. "
"16023920","16025440"," So, so that happened, right?"
"16026760","16029280"," So the pizza joint happened."
"16030120","16039780"," Now the breakfast joint after that happened, I went and watched the video on how Waffle House"
"16039780","16045620"," cooks take orders, how the server staff does it, and the cooks do it."
"16046420","16048920"," Do you have you guys ever watched any of those videos on Waffle House?"
"16049260","16051920"," It's bizarre and it's wild how they do that. "
"16052040","16056560"," And what this was not a Waffle House by the way, this is a local diner, like a local diner."
"16056560","16060460"," I don't want to buy that so bad."
"16060460","16061360"," I just got to wait. "
"16061460","16062660"," I got to wait until fucking four."
"16064960","16066620"," 336, another 20 minutes left."
"16069880","16072580"," I got to sit in my hands here and wait to buy some calls, man. "
"16072820","16073200"," I got to wait."
"16083780","16084760"," Did you see that, Mike?"
"16084920","16086780"," Did you see that Waffle House code shit?"
"16088280","16089340"," It's badass, right?"
"16092200","16093600"," And then I, you know what I looked up afterwards?"
"16093840","16095620"," What do they pay those guys or women or whatever?"
"16096660","16097820"," $14 an hour."
"16098240","16099060"," I'm like, what?"
"16100840","16103520"," $14 an hour for having to learn that system. "
"16103920","16108600"," Got a bug is a long zone, he's saying."
"16110260","16112140"," But they do have it dialed in, don't they?"
"16123060","16123940"," Here goes that."
"16124100","16128040"," Here goes that that bleeding in the end of the day until you got people trying to get out from"
"16128040","16131220"," underneath into this close for all of these reports coming out. "
"16131320","16133720"," We actually have a large number of reports today."
"16139560","16140900"," Let's see if he can blow some of this up."
"16142080","16143500"," Let's just be able to switch over here. "

"16147820","16149200"," We'll get ready a little bit early here. "
"16158020","16160120"," We're just kind of looking kind of sloppy."
"16160500","16162400"," So we're going to, oh, hold on."
"16162520","16162800"," What is that?"
"16165640","16165980"," Webcam. "

"16180400","16184140"," And that is a forward down there. "
"16184900","16187480"," So we're going to move my box over here."
"16188760","16190320"," We're going to move me over there."
"16192260","16195680"," And we're going to watch these closes. "

"16250580","16253540"," There's INTC in the bottom right hand side. "
"16256580","16258700"," There we'll actually do the one minute chart here."

"16994260","16996360"," And I want to thank you all for showing up today. "
"16997600","16999500"," I want to thank you all for showing up today."
"16999740","17001500"," And then what else?"
"17001720","17002880"," We've got one more day left of the week."
"17003620","17004940"," And then comes the weekend. "
"17005280","17008360"," I'm going to do some reading here to you want to read some stuff off to you here in the"
"17008360","17010300"," background as we will wait the close here."
"17013600","17020140"," Man, I want to buy this so bad and like I'm not going to have patience patience."
"17020720","17023860"," I want to catch this. "
"17024240","17028880"," I want to catch a down move and then an up move like that right there."
"17034340","17035140"," Come on, baby."
"17035320","17036200"," You know how I might just buy it. "
"17036200","17036620"," Hold on a second."
"17052660","17054660"," I'm long for 14 C's."
"17057060","17059920"," And I don't care if they burn it. "
"17059960","17062480"," I don't think that I think I'm just going to stand that for 14 C."
"17063520","17065940"," And I'm going to hold and I'll add to him if I have to."
"17066020","17067680"," I small position only 25 contracts."
"17067680","17073100"," So let's see what happens here. "
"17107790","17112690"," I was kind of surprised from a game theory perspective, which is to say it's down most from its"
"17112690","17112950"," high."
"17112970","17114890"," So I down like 18% off the high."
"17115230","17117690"," That's participated the least on the way up over the last year. "
"17117810","17118210"," Dude, meta."
"17118590","17120450"," I'm on the meta trade."
"17121290","17123630"," So the point being if you're looking for a catalyst. "
"17124110","17127290"," And the fact that the setup looks like it might be a little bit favorable."
"17127450","17128650"," It makes sense there."
"17128790","17133950"," But it is surprising in the sense that the fundamental story and how it plays through to their"
"17133950","17138910"," bottom line is murkier than it is with the likes of meta or Microsoft. "
"17139650","17143750"," I mean, AWS and the growth and you know, the returning to that is going to be key."
"17144050","17148710"," So how would you assess so far this week now that we're basically through this batch."
"17149050","17151710"," We'll get Amazon, of course, and what we make of it. "
"17151890","17153090"," What it tells us of anything."
"17153090","17158810"," I mean, you have some definite surrender happening in the names people thought were safe to hold"
"17158810","17159770"," through this rough period."
"17160290","17161390"," That's part of the process. "
"17161690","17163290"," You know, these corrections go through these waves."
"17163870","17167710"," That being said, the wear and tear on the S&P 500 has been significant."
"17168050","17172010"," And you've been cracking through these hope for support levels pretty consistently. "
"17172330","17175250"," Now today, decent little intraday rally off the lows."
"17175730","17177690"," More stocks up than down in the New York Stock Exchange."
"17178130","17178210"," Equal way. "
"17178210","17178910"," Thank you, Russell."
"17183070","17184590"," You know, it just already had its pain."
"17184790","17189170"," So that more favorably, you could say that's a catch down move by the stuff that just hadn't been"
"17189170","17189590"," hit yet. "
"17190050","17194670"," The problem, I think, is trying to draw the macro message out of this market."
"17195030","17198130"," It hasn't been a positive one for a while, despite the GDP numbers."
"17198770","17202410"," I mean, I have been trying to make the case that the areas of the market that should have been"
"17202410","17205570"," hurt the most by slowdown fears and rates have already been hit. "
"17206190","17213910"," And then today, you see UPS, whirlpool, you know, you see Harley Davidson getting taken apart on"
"17213910","17217310"," bad numbers when you might have been able to make the case that they look cheap enough already."
"17217590","17219810"," So I think it's a it's another wave in that process."
"17219810","17221070"," So more earnings beside. "
"17221390","17225970"," I know Amazon sucking all the air out of the room, but Phil Ford coming up, I suspect most of"
"17225970","17232730"," the commentary is going to be around the strike and the deal with the UAWS estimated revenue of 141"
"17232730","17234450"," spot five, six billion dollars."
"17234850","17240190"," We're also expecting earnings from Intel on the bell estimated EPS of 22 cents in the revenue"
"17240190","17242570"," estimate of 13 spot five, four billion dollars."
"17246900","17248700"," This evening, we'll come down to this. "
"17249000","17253420"," When you look at the two, three consensus, the estimate is that the profits are going to be up"
"17253420","17254300"," about 50%."
"17254300","17259280"," But I don't think people are going to be too out of whack if the numbers are dramatically unless"
"17259280","17260460"," they're dramatically higher or lower."
"17260780","17264440"," The UAW contract cost is what the analyst will be talking with Jim Farley about. "
"17264660","17266380"," And what's happening with EV investments?"
"17267020","17272680"," You know, that was a major contentious issue that the UAW brought up that they wanted to have"
"17272680","17275580"," representation at Ford's future battery plants."
"17276100","17278600"," No doubt that question will come up during the conference call as well."
"17278960","17280180"," A couple other things to keep in mind. "
"17280520","17282480"," Scott, this is a contract that's going to cost four."
"17282480","17286040"," You know, that's a big one here in Detroit right now about that, about the battery."
"17286360","17287620"," For all of their 57,000. "
"17287620","17289560"," So we're building batteries in Detroit right now."
"17289560","17291000"," For the next four and a half years."
"17291580","17294740"," We just talked that we'll lose that work in Detroit. "
"17295140","17297020"," That we'll move out of state over those UAW."
"17301940","17304960"," You can actually give money to their people."
"17305200","17307540"," But as you take a look at your job matter too, right?"
"17307680","17308920"," It's a hard thing to walk. "
"17309040","17314500"," This is a company that is trying trying to pivot to more hybrid vehicles as the EV demand is"
"17314500","17315600"," slowing in this country."
"17316020","17316660"," Scott, all right."
"17316780","17317180"," Phil, we'll see. "
"17317480","17317760"," Thank you."
"17317960","17319320"," Phil Labo on Ford."
"17319520","17320560"," Kate Rogers on Chipotle. "
"17320840","17321580"," What shall we look out for?"
"17321920","17322560"," Hey, Scott."
"17322700","17329860"," So analysts are expecting EPS adjusted $10.55 on revenues of $2.472 billion for the quarter."
"17330360","17333480"," Comps expected to increase 4.6% compared to the guidance. "
"17333660","17334740"," Chipotle coming up too."
"17334860","17335300"," I'm going to make two single digits."
"17335860","17337800"," Pricing, of course, a key focus for Chipotle. "
"17338060","17339320"," It's really maintained its pricing."
"17339460","17340000"," Three minutes left."
"17340200","17341200"," They start to get some of these numbers. "
"17341520","17344520"," Some consumers pull back or trade down in the face of higher costs."
"17345000","17349900"," It did confirm to CNBC earlier this month that would be taking a modest price increase to offset"
"17349900","17353400"," inflation, adding it's the first time it's doing that in over a year."
"17353400","17358080"," The company saw some higher prices for some of its items like tortillas and dairy, along with beef,"
"17358280","17361720"," last quarter, but avocados, a key ingredient, came down in price. "
"17361920","17363360"," So we'll see how that impacts its margins."
"17363980","17366820"," The stock has come off some of its highs, but it's still up about 30%."
"17366820","17371280"," A year to date, one of the best performers in the sector for the year, we've seen companies that do"
"17371280","17372460"," have that higher price points. "
"17372560","17373500"," Does that button work right now?"
"17373600","17378780"," Like the CMG, a shack, or sweet green do a bit better in terms of stock performance this year"
"17378780","17379880"," versus others in this space."
"17380300","17383920"," We're also, of course, going to have a CNBC exclusive with CEO Brian Nickel today after earnings"
"17383920","17385320"," next hour."
"17385500","17386440"," So tune in for more on our list. "
"17386440","17387220"," That button works or not."
"17387280","17388720"," I'm going to see it over time."
"17388940","17390040"," Okay, Rogers, thank you very much. "
"17390180","17395100"," Finally, D Amazon, AWS, emergence."
"17396220","17397140"," Are we going to get it or not?"
"17397260","17399180"," Mark Mahaney, you've heard of only 50-50 chance."
"17400160","17402960"," That's exactly it that we need to see a reemergence. "
"17403060","17407200"," We need to see the bottom of that AWS growth deceleration."
"17407340","17408520"," It's been six straight quarters."
"17408640","17410380"," We've seen margin contraction as well. "
"17410380","17413120"," This is the profit engine of all of Amazon."
"17413600","17416660"," So it needs to be on the upswing."
"17416920","17419260"," And so that's really what kind of the quarter rests on. "
"17419540","17423040"," Ken Andy Jassy and his team say that we've seen the bottom, then it's going to come up."
"17423280","17428820"," This also relates to its AI push because a lot of this is happening in the cloud unit, that massive"
"17428820","17430700"," investment into anthropic."
"17431080","17434740"," Microsoft essentially told us that, you know, it can monetize this now. "
"17434940","17436820"," Customers are going to be paying for some of these tools."
"17436820","17438500"," Two minutes left in story reports."
"17438560","17439520"," It's higher for Amazon. "
"17439920","17443000"," Last thing I'll say Scott, is that, of course, this is an e-commerce company."
"17443460","17444860"," Although that is not the profit engine."
"17445100","17446480"," The margins are much thinner there. "
"17447040","17448800"," We're heading into the holiday quarter."
"17449240","17452480"," So Amazon will give guidance and that's got to be good for the street."
"17452660","17454080"," Well, we'll see in the next few minutes with that. "
"17454440","17455500"," Here, Jabosa, thank you very much."
"17455640","17456740"," I've turned back to Mike Santoli."
"17456900","17463320"," You look at tech, these losses over a one-week period, alphabet down 11, meta down near eight,"
"17464340","17465360"," Intel's almost down nine. "
"17465360","17467800"," Dude, I want that a so bad here."
"17467960","17469200"," Like, I should just buy it."
"17469200","17473760"," I should come essentially the source of funds to do anything else, which is possibly to put it in"
"17473760","17476980"," cash, just because they have held up that much better. "
"17477420","17481500"," But they are growing more reliably than the rest of the board going wild right now."
"17481620","17484740"," But they just probably got too much credit for that in the short term."
"17484740","17485880"," Most of them still in uptrend. "
"17486000","17487020"," Turn that off in the background."
"17487560","17493920"," We got some blood here on the clothes on spy and on Ford, live it on ENPH as well and"
"17493920","17495020"," Amazon last minute."
"17495420","17497340"," A couple of minutes there, not to be unexpected here. "
"17497420","17498100"," It's kind of normal."
"17498780","17502740"," Ford blasting down right now, trading 11.36 into the bell here."
"17503640","17507680"," We've got Amazon blasting up to the north, now reversing to the downside. "
"17509800","17510520"," Ooh, baby."
"17512380","17513500"," What do we got here?"
"17518260","17528040"," Is there any time for now expecting earnings from Amazon and"
"17528040","17528380"," Intel?"
"17530620","17532740"," Add another 25 right now."
"17538640","17539880"," Now on 50. "
"17541840","17544160"," Whoa, Amazon."
"17545680","17548360"," Trading $1.20.97 there for a moment."
"17549200","17559770"," $1.20.97. Looking for some liquidity in the upside on Amazon, INTC"
"17559770","17561930"," with another ghost print to the upside as well. "
"17562350","17569250"," ENPH Ford to the downside, trading is low for a moment there at 11.35. Amazon earnings coming"
"17569250","17569790"," through now."
"17569990","17573710"," EPS coming in out of beats at 94 cents on the 58 cents."
"17573710","17574510"," Oh, baby, print that shit out. "
"17574870","17579610"," So is he operating income at a beats 11 spot, $1.9 billion on an estimate of seven spot, $7 "
"17579610","17580190",".1 billion."
"17585950","17593150"," So net sales are coming into the beats, $143 billion in estimates of $141 spot, $56 billion, web"
"17593150","17599650"," services, net sales, X4, X plus 12 cents estimated at plus 12 spot, four percent, so that's a miss."
"17600230","17604170"," Amazon web service net sales of $23 spot, $06 billion on estimates. "
"17604310","17606310"," Expect a reversal here in just a few moments."
"17606310","17608650"," You've got some misses on Amazon heads up here."
"17608730","17610550"," It's going to go to the other side, it's going to the wrong side here. "
"17610550","17616250"," 6% operating income again, a beat at 11 spot, $1.9 billion on estimates of seven spot, $7.1"
"17616250","17616510"," billion."
"17617370","17623710"," So online stores net sales of $57 spot, $27 billion of beats on estimates of $56 spot, $82 billion."
"17624410","17630650"," Subscription services net sales, a slight beat at 10 spot, $1.7 billion on estimates of 10 spot, $3"
"17630650","17630950"," billion. "
"17631770","17636830"," Physical store net sales are a miss though at 4 spot, $96 billion on estimates of 4 spot, $99"
"17636830","17643710"," billion and North American net sales are a beat at $87 spot, $89 billion on estimates of $87 spot,"
"17643810","17644450"," $12 billion."
"17645370","17650610"," So forward guidance, they see Q4 net sales at 160 to $167 billion."
"17651450","17655890"," So that's on the low end of the prior estimate, that was $166 spot, $57 billion. "
"17656310","17659930"," So a slight downgrade to the fourth quarter net sales forward guidance."
"17662230","17667490"," However, Q3 net sales on this report has beat at $143 spot, $08 billion."
"17667990","17671410"," Again, on estimates of $141 spot, $5 or $6 billion. "
"17672990","17677470"," Actually, some of those misses aren't so bad, like the Amazon stores and stuff like that doesn't"
"17677470","17678370"," really mean too much."
"17680380","17682080"," So not too bad, actually, it's pretty good."
"17682260","17685020"," Amazon with that, I'm going to call that a beat across the board. "
"17685180","17688740"," Up as much as a 4 spot, 2% post market following that."
"17688740","17691580"," Yeah, so again, EPS and net sales both beating."
"17691620","17692660"," Yeah, both beats. "
"17692760","17693800"," So that's what really matters."
"17694080","17694960"," So that's good for Amazon."
"17695540","17701720"," Amazon now trading $125.94, the misses were just small, like small stuff. "
"17701840","17706920"," You'll find assets where it's $24 spot, $8 billion, $2.5 spot, $63 trillion in the week ending"
"17706920","17708120"," October 25th."
"17708540","17713200"," Amazon trading $1.26 or $1.26 or $1.08 or $2.02"
"17713200","17720160"," right now."
"17720160","17730490"," $26.53, $1 "
"17730490","17736570",".053, starting to come into the Amazon anticipated or expected move. "
"17737350","17740250"," And so again, pretty much beats across the board from Amazon there."
"17740370","17744650"," A slight downgrade on their forward guidance from next year, but still within the range that was"
"17744650","17745830"," given on the last."
"17746130","17750310"," Yeah, the misses were like shit, you're not going to ever expect them to make money off Yeah, many"
"17750310","17752790"," beats, they're operating margin beats as well. "
"17752790","17759690"," Net sales beating, they're jumping now as much as five spots, 7% topping estimates on their"
"17759690","17760550"," earnings report there."
"17760890","17761830"," Let's keep them on me."
"17761830","17765210"," I'm still awaiting Intel reporting their Q3 earnings as well. "
"17773880","17781080"," Amazon right now breaking above their weekly trigger at $1.26. So right here, this is their weekly"
"17781080","17781520"," trigger."
"17782140","17785880"," Let me switch over and just show you guys where Amazon is."
"17785880","17787420"," So Amazon right now trading. "
"17787620","17794480"," If you're long Amazon stock, this is one of the places to take the money and run on their weekly"
"17794480","17797260"," trigger at $1.26 and then you've got above it."
"17797860","17808360"," One more, we've got one more place or place of interest above, which is $1.29.45. So"
"17808360","17810180"," there could be one more top take up here."
"17810680","17812400"," Could see one more blast up here. "
"17813060","17817820"," But if you are long Amazon, we are into the weekly trigger at this point."
"17819340","17819820"," Thanks."
"17821500","17823320"," There is one more target. "
"17823620","17826140"," I think it could possibly hit briefly before the reversal to the downside."
"17826640","17833900"," So if you're long the underlying, you might get one more squeeze off of this in the next coming few"
"17833900","17834500"," moments."
"17834780","17835680"," 4.05 right now. "
