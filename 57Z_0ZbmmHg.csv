"17800","18580"," All right."
"20640","21720"," We're almost there."
"21980","22540"," Hang tight, guys. "
"22920","23640"," See the second?"
"35210","37390"," Let me see if I can bring this up."
"42340","44900"," See if it's going there."
"49820","50360"," Hang tight, guys. "
"51020","52860"," Can any of you hear me out there?"
"53020","53120"," Yeah."
"57420","61560"," Just type something like be quiet."
"63099","66020"," All right, so on the left there, you'll see that's a flow algo. "
"66560","67580"," It's one of a few."
"67580","71400"," I use trade ticks and flow algo."
"72900","73880"," So I'm just going to keep. "
"75180","80720"," Can any of you hear me out there?"
"80900","80980"," Yeah."
"82200","83300"," I'm going to mute this."
"87350","88150"," All right. "
"88610","88990"," Let's see."
"89530","90390"," Can you hear it?"
"90390","91830"," Hey, Mr. Brown, can you hear me?"
"92410","92510"," Fine."
"92970","94690"," No, there's no reverb or anything. "
"98660","99200"," Right on."
"99480","99860"," Thanks, guys."
"100840","102040"," I switched over to Apple. "
"102340","103240"," Do you guys want me to watch?"
"103340","105880"," Like, is there a consensus on what you guys want me to watch?"
"105880","109140"," Watch your watch by Apple the cues specific."
"109860","129900"," I typically tend"
"129900","133140"," to watch the spy into the clothes here, where we're still early."
"133360","133780"," It's only 250. "
"142580","143260"," Thanks, guys."
"143880","145180"," Let me give me a second here."
"145220","147200"," I'm going to bring up tweet deck and all that kind of stuff. "
"150200","154960"," I don't know if you guys heard that."
"155000","155500"," That's my dog."
"155540","159600"," He's he needs some attention. "
"168040","170300"," Give me just a second, guys."
"170540","186420"," Yeah, someone's"
"186420","190680"," saying someone's talking about Tesla's volume is very low today."
"191140","193560"," That's typical for stocks. "
"193860","199260"," When stocks move up, everyone seems to think that lots of volume makes a stock go up."
"199260","208660"," But in reality, the less volume you have, the better your luck of it going up."
"209100","213900"," I'm not wording that properly here, but low volume days on a stock will tend to make it rip much"
"213900","214140"," higher. "
"214580","218580"," You can see on the volume that came into a lot of stocks though today, or at least into the"
"218580","221400"," indexes and in some stocks that were kind of tamped down."
"221900","222960"," It was nice to see."
"223180","232340"," Yeah, there's some there's some and video. "
"236060","237200"," Let's take a look through here."
"238860","240500"," You can see all that apple flow."
"241020","247600"," I was surprised to see more snap or snap puts come in even though there's still some calls coming"
"247600","248040"," in here. "
"254340","257700"," Can you guys see the ticker symbols on the left hand side of the screen?"
"258459","260459"," You guys don't want to let me know if you can see the actual ticker symbol."
"261360","265060"," I don't know if you got there's a little bit of delay here."
"265680","268640"," I put this up with land too so it would be faster. "
"269420","272840"," You can see the ticker signs or I can on my screen."
"273580","274960"," Let me know if you can see those okay."
"276200","278800"," So a lot of people right now are talking on Twitter. "
"279180","282240"," I posted earlier about possibly taking along into the close."
"282980","286460"," It'd be something that you'd have to take and then hold and dump into the close."
"286760","291780"," If it does spring, you do see some other stocks in big tech that hold up spy doing that right"
"291780","292060"," now. "
"292460","298100"," You saw apple make a rip to the highs and you already know that the Tesla gang is going to"
"298100","299580"," be hoping for that same thing right?"
"300240","302380"," You know Tesla gang sees it up here."
"302420","309180"," It just sprung slightly to 1065 and I think Tesla gang is hoping and praying that it gets that that"
"309180","311720"," quick meteor shot to 1095."
"312400","318840"," I think that's what I measured R."
"318940","322000"," I was posting on Twitter and I said that the measured move should be 10. "
"322340","324020"," I think it was 1095 that I tagged."
"325800","327440"," Let's take a look at 1090s R."
"327580","327700"," No."
"328320","328560"," No. "
"328880","329000"," Yeah."
"329220","329340"," No."
"329420","330500"," I tag over here. "
"330760","336360"," I think it was 1095 for the measured move 1096 or something like that could have been lower."
"337040","341300"," But I think that's what Tesla bulls are looking for today is that is that strong finish."
"341940","344560"," That could bring spy up with apple being as high as it is. "
"346100","349900"," Although what I'm looking for here is I'm looking for a sell down."
"350160","357380"," So just so you know out there in Twitter land, I'm looking for the sell down into either just the"
"357380","359280"," close or into tomorrow."
"359820","361400"," You figure we've got one more. "
"361540","365660"," Well, we've got one more don't we got two more days until Friday CPI."
"367100","371520"," If we had a nice down end of day today, nice down day tomorrow."
"372180","373720"," That would get usually it's weird. "
"374020","377320"," Thursdays can be down days too, or that I find in my experience."
"377540","381620"," But surprisingly, some Thursdays can be really, really good days."
"382220","384360"," You get really big moves on Thursdays sometimes. "
"385120","389760"," And then when I was looking at the options data for spy today."
"390100","390260"," Okay."
"390300","397200"," So in the options data for spy, the robots there, the algorithms are now inside for today. "
"397700","401780"," They're trying to pin at 469 and 467."
"402820","410660"," There's 180,000 calls on each on each side of spy right here, which there was only pinning on the"
"410660","412800"," put side all day long today."
"412800","414140"," They pinned it all day long. "
"414660","419400"," So I but there isn't there are new calls on 469 for 38 cents."
"420400","424220"," So I am wondering if they're going to spring it towards the end of the day today."
"424560","426260"," Someone someone's betting on that. "
"426760","434440"," Now on Friday, there's increased options interest at 470 C on the spy as well."
"434780","437540"," That's and that but that's pretty expensive stuff there."
"437940","440440"," So this is a good example or a good time to talk about something. "
"440900","445380"," Sometimes I can look just at the just at the option chains."
"446240","452280"," And if you start watching option chains on the weeklies on your favorite stock out there or say"
"452280","458420"," favorite index, you will see that they have an average price on certain days of the week."
"459320","463960"," And you'll hear one comment out there people will say the reason why an option is expensive is"
"463960","465140"," because it's going someplace. "
"465920","472860"," But I'm always looking for the average prices of slightly in the money stocks and indexes right"
"472860","475900"," around the opens and closes so I can become familiar with them."
"476800","485240"," And right now the 470 C to me is a little bit pricey for Friday OPEX."
"485800","492520"," So I see it's at $1.45 right now $1.46. Normally for that for in the money they like"
"492520","492700"," today. "
"494660","497060"," I'm looking because we're already on Wednesday."
"497460","504500"," So I'm looking for that in the money 470 C to drop down to probably 50, 40, 50, 60 cents"
"504500","505880"," before it comes back."
"506440","510800"," But I don't I don't know for today right now you're you're looking at spy live right now. "
"511120","515520"," And you know bulls are you can see the flow coming in right now for the spy."
"516720","517440"," See here."
"519820","525120"," You can see all this flow coming in and video will push by up apple push by up Walmart's a"
"525120","525760"," part of the spy. "
"526260","531300"," So you're starting to see that flow come in that people are betting on a rip right now and the"
"531300","532460"," end of the day for the spy."
"532820","534980"," And that's what I'm why I came out a little bit earlier."
"535640","542640"," I want to see if I want to see if we bounce off this 470 above here if we even"
"542640","544520"," make it up here at some point today. "
"545100","546480"," This is the risky play of the day."
"547060","548040"," Not so much this stuff."
"548200","549360"," There's lots of grinding in here. "
"550000","556140"," But this lead this usually does lead up to a moment of either sell off or rip much much higher."
"556520","563100"," And the reason is that you have all these bulls in here betting on this move higher to the 470"
"563100","563740"," mark."
"563740","568680"," You have all the bulls from yesterday and they're all waiting for this move even if it's just for a"
"568680","569260"," brief moment. "
"569840","572700"," They're looking to to squeeze this much much higher."
"573260","579720"," So we'll watch this into the four o'clock hour and I will keep checking these option chains and"
"579720","581660"," seeing if they are long."
"582400","587680"," Then you can see now that 469 it went from 48 cents up to 51 now. "
"588360","590220"," It's still too risky for my blood."
"592260","593480"," So we'll see."
"593980","595600"," I'll read what you guys are typing. "
"596340","597020"," All right, hold on."
"598060","599000"," All good cap."
"599340","599680"," Hi there. "
"600060","601140"," Apple retest by please."
"601920","606900"," Also sweating Nvidia and UPST. Yeah, definitely take time. "
"607600","609840"," Hey guys, good to see you guys again."
"610460","611260"," I'm on the phone."
"611500","612360"," So no, Troy Corp. "
"613030","616240"," So we sell after the rip 1077."
"616680","617620"," That's a good number."
"617700","620140"," Is that what I don't know if I said 1077?"
"620680","624180"," I forget exactly what I posted on Twitter as a price target. "
"625140","626500"," Are you or endless?"
"626720","630420"," Are you calling that as 1077 or did I call it at 1077?"
"630700","631280"," I don't remember."
"632480","633820"," I'm seeing spying screen."
"633980","635480"," I want that rip cool flow. "
"635640","637440"," I'll go was wondering where those screens are from."
"638040","640400"," Yeah, so I put so I use flow."
"640660","643180"," I've been using Tradytix to do research. "
"643940","648280"," I'm going to roll trades and Tradytix stuff into the sub."
"648940","650320"," And then I what I like about flow."
"650500","656560"," I'll go the most is it's very directed towards in the moment type stuff. "
"656680","659720"," Sometimes it's a little late, but it does a couple of things."
"660160","661660"," It usually shows well a few things."
"661860","667840"," It shows me when I first get on in the morning, oftentimes it'll show me a stock that's ripping"
"667840","670460"," right off the clothes that's going to come back down for shorts. "
"671700","675260"," And then it will start to build through the day telling a story as well."
"675460","680920"," You'll start to see I think earlier this morning, I posted a screenshot of Apple at the top of the"
"680920","683620"," at the top of the chart on flow."
"684180","689120"," I'll go and what it was implying this morning was that it would rip much higher. "
"689120","695240"," Once I made that video around the midday talking about that aspect of it is, you know, does Apple"
"695240","698280"," scream way higher later in the afternoon or the spine?"
"698280","702800"," And it gets so dangerous because it could be so fast."
"703440","707100"," And you're seeing that in Apple just just a few moments ago."
"707660","712760"," I want to say it was like 10 minutes after I made that post about sending young bulls to battle. "
"713200","718820"," Now they did pin spy when that took place by dropping Tesla, I think I wasn't able to look at"
"718820","720120"," all these stocks at the same time."
"720500","722660"," But now you see spy moving up here."
"723800","729100"," We'll see if it if it actually flacks off of 470 or not. "
"729220","734800"," And just so you know, 470 is the is the put wall that's above."
"735460","737640"," So you're going to be looking for two things."
"738140","743200"," You're either going to look for a rejection or we or we break past. "
"743580","748420"," If we break past, that's the short covering that we keep talking about that's been going on."
"748420","754540"," And if it doesn't break through, it means that there's still too many sellers selling it selling"
"754540","756220"," into the market."
"756220","756960"," There's some fear. "
"757280","761820"," And we talked about that this morning that, hey, I want to see that bounce lower and you're going"
"761820","765500"," to see these bag holders say, well, I have to get out now."
"765500","766480"," I have to get out now."
"767540","769060"," And so that's what we got here. "
"769520","770040"," Cool flow."
"770200","772020"," I thought you mentioned it might be wrong though."
"772060","773680"," Yeah, unless I'm not exactly positive. "
"774100","776520"," It was either that number sounds familiar as well."
"776600","780760"," I'll have to go thought that we would have that squeeze."
"781600","785560"," I think the market has gotten over poll enough to not really care what's said anymore at the FMC. "
"786320","787300"," Yes, dream storm."
"787840","789580"," So here's my deal."
"790260","798780"," I okay, so as of right now, I would like to see rates or some rates, even if they're small"
"798780","800100"," at this FOMC. "
"800700","807040"," But you also have you want your I try to look at it from a larger viewpoint."
"807580","808820"," And we're end of the year."
"809300","811440"," It's the time for everybody to take some profit. "
"812020","817260"," You have to think about the guy named Joe that works a job every day and has a pension plan."
"817860","822060"," You have to think about if he has a good end of year and then we can come into the"
"822060","826800"," new year and you then say to Joe, hey, look buddy, you had a great run for the last two"
"826800","827080"," years."
"827280","828160"," Now we're going to pull the rug. "
"828560","831100"," That makes more sense to me for the market."
"831600","833300"," The market's been preparing though for rates."
"833980","838280"," This action that we've had is us preparing for for rates to be announced. "
"839140","846840"," So what I would expect at this point is those three things that expect volatility downward moves as"
"846840","848480"," we get closer to the FOMC."
"849740","856240"," My other fear is that even if they don't announce rates, they will briefly drop it to bring it back"
"856240","856500"," up."
"856660","863420"," Sometimes the plan, and this is part of my issue with the news out there, is that if there's"
"863420","868940"," something if there's something the market does not know and let's say the market's pricing in the"
"868940","876000"," market going down or that rates will be announced and let's say they don't announce what is"
"876000","876520"," expected. "
"877360","884180"," The hedge funds and banks will stay the course in their original plan and they'll still dump the"
"884180","887080"," market even if they're going to raise it back up."
"887280","894440"," So they'll change what the news means to meet their own ends of where they've what they've been"
"894440","895100"," working towards."
"895500","900440"," Oftentimes you'll hear people say, well, I thought this was bad news or I thought this was good"
"900440","904140"," news and it's because they use the news to whatever and they want. "
"904520","913180"," A prime example of this would be the last election when Biden had won they they pushed the market"
"913180","920080"," up and they dragged out, I forget his name, they dragged out our cash in on CNBC and old our"
"920080","924660"," cash in sitting there and he said, well, we're going to send the market up because the Senate"
"924660","927700"," didn't get the two seats that they needed."
"927980","932920"," So we don't care who the president is because we have a divided presidency and a divided Senate."
"933820","940120"," No later than two weeks later, we found out that I think it was Georgia and Arizona had two of"
"940120","946220"," those seats flip and the Senate for all intents of purposes went to the Democrats. "
"946440","950520"," So you had Democrats controlling the presidency in the Senate and in your mind you would think that"
"950520","955920"," they would drop the market at that point because they didn't have division in the Senate in"
"955920","957860"," presidency, which is what the markets like."
"957980","963120"," The markets prefer to know what's happening and they prefer gridlock in our governments."
"963640","965800"," So when that didn't happen though, they didn't dump the markets. "
"966520","973660"," So you have to look past sometimes what we think the market news means and look more at where the"
"973660","977620"," banks want the price of our market."
"978180","980780"," So think about that as we head towards FOMC."
"980900","984700"," If you see the market slowly slowing down towards it, it might just dump it anyways. "
"985320","989960"," And then once they're done dumping it anyways, if it was good news, they'll rocket ship it back up."
"990840","993740"," Did that answer any questions on the FOMC?"
"994120","994600"," I hope it did."
"995500","1002700"," So anyways, with FOMC, I'm still going to expect weakness into that date and I will probably buy"
"1002700","1008120"," some, I'll pull myself out of the market and I'll still be here for you guys, but I'll probably"
"1008120","1009280"," pull myself out of the market. "
"1009380","1014560"," I might buy some slightly, yeah, John Hill with the full bear."
"1015380","1017900"," John Hill's banking."
"1018160","1022380"," There's a lot of bears banking on this right now, on this weakness heading into the 15th. "
"1023260","1029040"," And there are some puts or a lot of puts out there that banks want to print."
"1029540","1032640"," So I get that or at least put spreads that they want to print."
"1033460","1035240"," What are the the intentions behind?"
"1035520","1036099"," Yes, thanks. "
"1037220","1043560"," Yeah, you're going to still experience, you're still going to experience weakness in the market"
"1043560","1044660"," from the FOMC."
"1044900","1049300"," But there have been previous FOMC's where the news leaks early."
"1049660","1054300"," Sometimes it's right around a half an hour, an hour before you'll start seeing it go in the wrong"
"1054300","1058660"," way and you'll say why is it coming up and it's because someone got the debt down low on it. "
"1060950","1061590"," Yeah, exactly."
"1062470","1065450"," A great Troy with the, agreed with the new agos."
"1066130","1067730"," They program in bad news. "
"1068150","1068670"," I agree with that."
"1070170","1070690"," 100%."
"1070690","1076470"," And you can also notice that too, our last drop that we had, one of the neat parts of our"
"1076470","1085550"," last drop and why we were, why we were headed towards a feedback loop in negativity in our markets"
"1085550","1093270"," was because there were long only hedge funds that they, they wound up getting margin called on"
"1093270","1094510"," stocks like Docu. "
"1094790","1098110"," So they bought puts at the absolute worst time."
"1098250","1102690"," And they're, they have these protocols in place to protect themselves at certain levels."
"1103030","1106890"," So it's like, oh, we have to buy all these, hit the buy all these, all these puts down here,"
"1107530","1111230"," super expensive, way too expensive to be buying. "
"1112570","1117490"," And he's right in Troy, Troy is very, very right on that, on that subject."
"1118810","1121730"," They are programmed for, for the, for the bad news at FMC."
"1123550","1125450"," Okay, so what are we looking at here?"
"1125650","1127690"," This might just get landed right into the end here. "
"1127830","1128470"," Have you got to do it?"
"1128790","1129570"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"1129750","1132710"," You guys think it's going to go up or go down for the spot here?"
"1132830","1134030"," I think it's not going up."
"1134570","1139150"," I think it's going to get parked because I'm not seeing, I'm not seeing much action here. "
"1139350","1141410"," And I'm looking at Apple on a different screen right now."
"1141710","1143370"," And Apple is just kind of hanging out."
"1144430","1147110"," You've got tassels just kind of hanging out. "
"1147730","1149530"," Oh, I was watching TLT today."
"1149650","1151490"," It's on the cusp of crashing right now."
"1152250","1156070"," If TLT were to crash or dump into the end of the day, you might see that rip. "
"1156490","1161050"," If you guys want to look on your own screens at TLT, it's starting to base out right here."
"1161810","1164790"," And it's one of those, it's one of those things I'm always looking for."
"1164790","1172130"," If you see TLT just start dumping down to this, let's say it dumps down to like 144 or something,"
"1172850","1176450"," you would see a mad dash to the top on tech. "
"1177270","1182250"," And then that bounce of course would be just like on the 23rd."
"1182490","1189890"," So if you were to look back on, you can see this fall right here on the 23rd."
"1190090","1193210"," I want you guys to look at this real quick at home wherever you're trading. "
"1193490","1194230"," You see this right here?"
"1195290","1198330"," See this dump, the major, major dump we had."
"1198950","1205150"," So this was also the day that TLT started to rip."
"1205410","1207230"," It hit a bottom and started to rip. "
"1207810","1213570"," So I've been trying to keep an eye on TLT all day long because you might see this massive dumping"
"1213570","1215650"," of TLT, a rip in the market."
"1216290","1220990"," And then the moment that it bottoms, you'll start to see that our market start to sell off, the spy"
"1220990","1221990"," start to sell off."
"1222210","1228870"," Take a look real quick and tell me what you guys think of the relationship between TLT and the"
"1228870","1229170"," queues. "
"1230470","1232350"," And you can see overlays of that stuff too."
"1234150","1236210"," I'll use this as a secondary indicator."
"1236810","1238330"," I'll use the VIX, of course. "
"1238590","1242650"," I use spy if I'm trading stocks or the indexes."
"1242970","1245270"," And then I always try to keep TLT on the background."
"1246510","1248350"," Let me look back and see what you guys had to say. "
"1251600","1258040"," Yep, same range two hours, TLT down, banks up, Apple just above VWAP if we can get below, then we"
"1258040","1258480"," may sell."
"1258880","1259320"," Yeah, agreed."
"1260420","1261960"," Agreed on all these points right here. "
"1264200","1265400"," Yeah, I'm not saying much."
"1266680","1270100"," Looking at where TLT is, it would be my guest."
"1270480","1275660"," There was someone that I met who said they're going to park it like Sully Park to an airplane right"
"1275660","1277460"," into the clothes here. "
"1278140","1285560"," I'm going to try to park the whole market because it's either if TLT dumps right here, the two wild"
"1285560","1288940"," reactions would be tech screaming to all-time highs."
"1290320","1296000"," And then a reversal that would be vicious, vicious reversal in the market."
"1297440","1302540"," I'm going to take a look right now, AMC. "
"1303320","1310260"," Did GM, so if you guys want to look at something neat, so GME, I don't normally, I'm going to"
"1310260","1319660"," ask you guys not to spam the sub with AMC and GME stuff because it can get out of control"
"1319660","1320760"," real fast."
"1321440","1325520"," But on my other screener here, I was looking for something, some kind of dip like this."
"1326460","1328220"," It's for all any of your apes out there. "
"1333560","1336560"," I'm looking forward for this one more dip down here."
"1336640","1342120"," This is going to be an interesting one right here because you got this nice push, a bounce, nice"
"1342120","1342540"," push."
"1343680","1345340"," And this one really didn't take off. "
"1345440","1347320"," It lost its steam here at the end of the day."
"1348180","1351420"," And I was thinking that maybe we might get a second rip."
"1352220","1358400"," I don't play GM anymore, but I know some of you guys play AMC. "
"1358900","1359680"," You guys play meme stocks."
"1360180","1360800"," So I get it."
"1362120","1368060"," If I just ask that you don't spam the sub or comments with GME stuff because I'll start"
"1368060","1369080"," banhammering you guys. "
"1369560","1373360"," I love you guys, but I don't want to see you guys spamming."
"1373800","1377000"," The meme stuff becomes too cluttered."
"1377760","1378720"," But I will address it. "
"1379000","1381320"," I've got requests to address that stuff here and there."
"1381640","1385060"," You've got a request to do a lie or a stream on gold."
"1385580","1386980"," Are you guys interested in gold?"
"1387880","1389500"," Because I could do gold for you as well. "
"1389660","1391420"," I guess you guys like silver gold, that kind of stuff."
"1392100","1394020"," I could try to do that once a week for you."
"1398280","1401200"," Yeah, this is just the slow grind into clothes. "
"1402900","1403660"," This is crazy."
"1407980","1409060"," Let me see here."
"1421940","1426720"," Some people saying there's only 17 trading days left in the market. "
"1427020","1428600"," So where does it go from here to there?"
"1429160","1431360"," Do we just grab them and go long here?"
"1432860","1436680"," Some one other guy just wrote, some accounts should blow up around December 20th."
"1437380","1441080"," Don't bother sitting DMs with what you think with that stuff."
"1442680","1445520"," This is hilarious. "
"1454760","1459760"," How do you know what it is going to rip when you call it and then it does that?"
"1460180","1460320"," Chase."
"1460560","1461880"," Chase wants to ask some questions."
"1463200","1472860"," So I made this video earlier about where I said I'm not going to get involved"
"1472860","1478400"," in the Apple or spy trade where it's at right now. "
"1479460","1481920"," And sometimes bulls don't see this stuff."
"1482200","1483200"," They get scared."
"1483540","1484640"," They want to take the profit and run. "
"1484760","1486740"," And I often take my profit and run too."
"1487600","1488920"," I'm known to do that."
"1489380","1491620"," I'm known to get out of trades too early. "
"1492480","1496440"," But we're going to look at Apple real quick and I'm going to explain why that is."
"1498280","1503280"," And this is very similar to let's look at Apple on the one month."
"1503280","1511380"," And we're going to the reason we're going to look at this one month is you put so much energy"
"1512040","1519700"," into this move here that it winds up you see this you see this right he gets one two and"
"1519700","1527060"," three and then in here you just have that you have this law this last one two three damn big"
"1527060","1534240"," ass bar big push and inside of here this is a little liquidity environment you've got people that"
"1534240","1541300"," can push Apple up that last little bit but you see how long it lasted it was for just the"
"1541300","1548620"," briefest of moments and then down here you had this you had this nice pennant down here right we're"
"1548620","1555300"," remaining bullish everyone still believes boom move up we immediately sell off everyone that's in"
"1555300","1562120"," here is upset there now we've got longs here here and this starts to look just like when we sell"
"1562120","1566880"," off like when the market really sells off you know when the market's done because you'll see this"
"1566880","1573400"," giant green hammer candle this giant red hammer candle and this giant green followed by a giant"
"1573400","1579360"," green hammer candle and the reason I'm talking about that is because on the inverse when you're"
"1579360","1585560"," bullish you're looking for all of this energy that's in here and these banks institutions retail"
"1585560","1591860"," they want that last payoff and you kind of saw that right here in this move and now that you're"
"1591860","1597400"," looking at the next move you're seeing a reversal that's a that's a bad doji to be looking at"
"1597400","1603720"," that's that's a reversal on apple now sometimes when you see those reversal candles you'll see"
"1603720","1609140"," another reversal so this but this right here is a very dangerous place for apple but you're you"
"1609140","1614380"," want to be seeing something like this you want to see that big push up and then this real fomo"
"1614380","1620300"," to the end right max it out start selling down your position if you're a bank they might even push"
"1620300","1626200"," it up once more and then sell down but if they don't they'll tease you that they're going to keep"
"1626200","1631320"," pushing it up and they'll slowly sell this stock down this is when the algo is really kicking and"
"1631320","1636240"," really start tricking traders into thinking that it's going to continue to go up double bottom"
"1636240","1645680"," right we pushed up one two and three and so you're expecting that last that last like blood curling"
"1645680","1654500"," we're going to take this rip now they did pin the spy from this rip happening but right here this"
"1654500","1660380"," looks like it's going to do it right this is in context this is a very bullish move this this"
"1660380","1665540"," look this would be a beautiful setup you see it right here a lot of people took this long knowing"
"1665540","1670140"," it would it would spring you can see it right here a push up and a down into close and"
"1670140","1675400"," then we spring up and so you're kind of looking for this move right here down and then a push"
"1675400","1680720"," up so i'm waiting on that next move over here i i'm not i'm not going to take this today"
"1680720","1686480"," i'm just waiting all right have you guys going to take take this trade into the close take it"
"1686480","1695950"," either with with longs or shorts hey jo mama how you doing okay hello what's all this right here i"
"1695950","1702510"," want to go read through this probably parked yep dreamstorm's got a good idea yes tesla got some t"
"1702510","1710610"," lt puts the other day good job on dray weekly opex yes likely to join 4685 and 4690 but probably"
"1710610","1716610"," ramped and dropped pin that's a fair point too i got 17 days to make tax-free money all right"
"1716610","1721450"," john we'll make we'll make you some tax-free money so new high by a penny could sell there me"
"1721450","1726410"," too since we are in positive gamma again shouldn't there be a dump ahead of opex or after with"
"1726410","1732750"," illiquid market around holiday as the gamma rolls off okay so i thought i talked about this this"
"1732750","1740030"," morning when i thought i talked about this this morning what we should be doing i posted i don't"
"1740030","1744750"," this is a chart from a different computer i set this up specifically for live streaming i'm gonna"
"1744750","1751250"," have to switch all my stuff over here or log in or something so that you guys can see my"
"1751250","1756350"," actual charts but what i'm what i'm looking for so right now you know you've got liquidity down"
"1756350","1764230"," below let's let's look at this from this perspective right here okay you know that we have"
"1764230","1769930"," liquidity come in here you know that we were touched right here a second time this infer is a"
"1769930","1776890"," double bottom right but sometimes we make these taps we'll take one two and then we'll have one"
"1776890","1784390"," quick moment of weakness to grab lungs to go high how do you get that that weakness does anybody"
"1784390","1791470"," know typically it's in the after hours and the overnight if they're going to drop it same goes with"
"1791470","1798490"," pushing it way higher it's typically in these hours you'll find the pj traders will take it deep or"
"1798490","1805450"," they'll take it very high to to get those gains or to get entry to go much higher so you"
"1805450","1809930"," have to decide what you want to do here in this market the only thing that the only thing that's"
"1809930","1817650"," a concern to me is this move right here is huge you see that move this is a huge move"
"1817650","1823590"," you should have been in down below here should have been in down below here should have been in"
"1823590","1829330"," down below here and now we're starting to get into a riskier environment even if we stay positive"
"1829330","1837430"," now that those put roll offs that we have coming down the pike are important as well what they will"
"1837430","1843990"," sometimes do is lend some weakness but they also lend power to the market because we did end up"
"1843990","1851870"," having so it stays the eighth right the seventh and then we've got the sixth right here we've got"
"1851870","1857590"," the third so let me show you this right here okay you see this right here this is the third"
"1857590","1864490"," right this is when we had a ton of gamma coming off the market on this third right here once"
"1864490","1870910"," that rolled out rolled off we shot way higher do you see that and so that's what I think that's"
"1870910","1880230"," what I think I think that's what Chase was talking about so yeah can you see weakness and Chase I"
"1880230","1886090"," wondered if you know when all this put gamma is rolling off it's on the does anybody know you guys"
"1886090","1892730"," type out there typed out you guys type the answers because I gave you the next two days where major"
"1892730","1899450"," put puts expire type in the box down there I want to see if anybody remembers the two dates it's"

"1943180","1951060"," calls the 17th is major major everybody was long for the 17th and then the 31st jill nailed that"

"2025390","2036060"," you oh yeah watch the resistance level at 467 take"
"2036060","2045380"," a look here so the VIX is now 19% below its 10 uh day simple moving average entering"

"2080960","2088080"," at 4700 that liquidity is sell those are sellers that are trying to to sell out of this market for"
"2088080","2093540"," where we are right now and then below you'll see that that yellow yellow line that's below the"
"2093540","2101680"," market right there that's where all the buyers are and that those that large liquidity at 4700 they"

"2249300","2254260"," if the stock splits or not what really matters is that there's going to be a lot of call interest"
"2254260","2260240"," it matters because the put wall was so low it matters because liquidity was coming up into the"
"2260240","2266220"," market and so your your chances here to make money work very well so these are the plays that I"

"2284640","2291860"," 1077 I think I think one of you guys got it right hey thanks Austin yeah no stock no stock"
"2291860","2296760"," split is fine I wasn't really playing this for the stock split I was playing it for the interest in"
"2296760","2302400"," the move to the stock split and of course we we made that move we had we had some trapped"
"2302400","2308940"," shorts down here and this move has in my view played itself out so if you ask me where's Tesla"
"2308940","2313460"," going from here it could go higher but why would you want to enter the why would you want to"
"2313460","2319760"," enter Tesla here or near that 1077 yeah it's already at 1071 so like why would you be entering"
"2319760","2324660"," Tesla here when you should have been entering it down below down here if you had entered down below"
"2324660","2331340"," here sure leave some on let it hang out until it gets to 1100 or 1200 but when you're starting"
"2331340","2337540"," to enter trades here it's it's bad it's bad trading it really is even if you win eventually you're"
"2337540","2341020"," gonna get you when you ask these but sometimes when you're asking these questions you're like hey"
"2341020","2346400"," should I enter this trade start to think about where other people are in that trade there are a lot"
"2346400","2353880"," of I mean Josh you're out there right did I see you Josh let's see oh not Josh Austin I"
"2353880","2362320"," know I know Josh Austin Austin no Austin and I have been trading Tesla together for I would say at"
"2362320","2367560"," the least since early summer we've been trading Tesla together and there's the right time to enter"
"2367560","2372960"," Tesla and there's the wrong time to enter Tesla so this was the right time to enter Tesla and you"
"2372960","2377320"," can see here and there's a lot of consolidation here I can see the point that it's going to go"
"2377320","2383320"," higher to to 1100 or 1200 but just ask yourself when should you be entering that trade this would"
"2383320","2388300"," have been a nice entry in here as well this is all consolidation this would have been a nice buy"
"2388300","2393940"," here at the start of today and you'll see this see all this down here you've got trap buyers you"
"2393940","2398960"," want to be living off them being trapped right you want them to fuel you making money over here"
"2398960","2407580"," okay so does Tesla go up today ultimate question and answer sure I can see Tesla going to 1077 I"
"2407580","2414540"," could even see Tesla going to 1200 do I think this is the buy-in no I don't I don't"
"2414540","2418820"," think it's the I don't think it's the buy-in so what does it say sold Tesla spreads too early"
"2418820","2428380"," oh that's right Austin so puts into the clothes don't ask about GME entered 991008 I bet that if I"
"2428380","2433280"," said now it'll rip to 1200 paralyzed by greed yeah no I get you guys I get what you guys"
"2433280","2437940"," are saying about stuff you know but that's the question is did you enter where did you enter is key"
"2437940","2444580"," the key is always did you enter down here or did you enter right here at 1071 like where should"
"2444580","2449740"," you be entering your trades then you really not as concerned with you notice concerned when it"
"2449740","2454600"," makes that move like when you're down at the 950 to a thousand I think I called it at 987"
"2454600","2460380"," in the pre-market or nine site was at nine something was like we were uh I don't know what"
"2460380","2467800"," this price is right here I can't really see wait this is all kind of wonky but I think it"
"2467800","2472560"," was at like 978 it was somewhere down below somewhere over here I think it was like 978 over here"
"2472560","2476560"," and I was telling you it could get it could start to squeeze in there so I guess the real"
"2476560","2481760"," question isn't shall I enter now of course not should have entered down here you should have"
"2481760","2488120"," entered down here you should have entered down here that was the time to enter these trades and now"
"2488120","2493940"," right here the yes we could we could squeeze up but if you're entering squeezes here the danger is"
"2493940","2502100"," so high see it's some great trades coming in though for the spy 12 8 469s more Teslas people do"
"2502100","2509540"," people put risk on this is wild to see definitely wild to see without a doubt it's making me kind"
"2509540","2514720"," of giggle here and watch from this take place yeah people are betting on this move into the close"
"2514720","2520440"," then so someone was asking who is it that was asking how to calculate the size of measure move with"
"2520440","2521700"," on Tesla okay so mr."
"2521900","2529860"," Brown that's a great question I will do a video on the general trends of Tesla I'll do an in"
"2529860","2536440"," that video I'll also show you how it tends to move and then I'll measure the moves for you as"
"2536440","2542880"," well there are some very easy basic measuring to see what what the targets are it doesn't always"
"2542880","2549320"," work out but 70% of the time it does yep the best way to make money on any asset"
"2549320","2556200"," is buying well absolutely ma so I will do a video on apple because I trade apple often and I"
"2556200","2561320"," trade I try not an apple I'll do a video on Tesla I trade Tesla often I trade apple very"
"2561320","2566320"," often I try to stick with just a few stocks so that I know the ins and outs of them"
"2566320","2575600"," let's see okay and Betty Mac asked about puts into the close so let's briefly talk about puts into"
"2575600","2581260"," the close and seeing all this money flowing in right now into this market right now okay and"
"2581260","2590940"," there's a ton and that's that would be my only hesitancy my only hesitancy so right down here"
"2590940","2595760"," you've got all these banks these banks all want to be buying here they bought here they bought here"
"2595760","2600700"," so the question would be do you should you buy puts in the close I don't think so this looks"
"2600700","2607420"," like a large move up in the market to me so I wouldn't be going short or buying puts into"
"2607420","2613860"," here but I am looking for a buying opportunity either at the open tomorrow or slightly deeper to"
"2613860","2620500"," take very very much long into the 31st now the second part of this would be your risk appetite if"
"2620500","2625200"," you're a bull and you're like hey I don't mind risk throw it at me this is lots of consolidation"
"2625200","2631580"," in this zone right here this is pointing towards a higher market this area but you still have CPI"
"2631580","2638520"," still have FOMC so you have to decide for yourself what your risk appetite is it's important for"
"2638520","2644280"," it's important for you to size your risk appetite for where we're going so I played all this down"
"2644280","2648980"," here you guys know I put post all my plays I played this right here I played this one right"
"2648980","2654720"," here and I didn't play this close yesterday I tried to but this move yesterday was too fast for me"
"2654720","2659580"," to catch I would have actually lost money right if I played this last night I would have I would"
"2659580","2666620"," have lost money and I didn't like the way that it moved yesterday look at that Facebook 1210 305"
"2666620","2676280"," for 2.6 or 2.6 million dollars Facebook 305 looks like a Facebook holy shit"
"2676280","2685980"," I mean look at that that's pure insanity for 305 so they're buying it down here"
"2685980","2693000"," this is all looking like a much larger move higher as this all looks like people don't care they're"
"2693000","2698820"," there even if they have weakness tomorrow it's not going to matter to people that we go that's only"
"2698820","2708300"," 1210 you see that three oh look at that 1210 305 1.4 million dollars 1210 305 2.6 million"
"2708300","2717220"," dollars that's look at that four million dollars and at the ass calls on Facebook into the close"

"2919370","2924890"," agree Kerry I am and with you you know this is the thing at where we are right now is"
"2924890","2934810"," that the risk versus reward is not as tasty as when we come back down yeah Josh"
"2934810","2939950"," everyone's expecting a pullbacks probably rocket to new highs overnight pullback or stay in range"
"2939950","2947730"," overnight is slightly down up on soft 468 the open up violently up math all right Matthew some of"

"2997010","3006380"," sometimes just like a Monday so the"
"3006380","3014190"," let's say you're looking to go up tomorrow if you were to look at the December 13th"
"3014190","3025050"," 480 calls there's a little interest not a ton they're only eight cents so"
"3025050","3034630"," let's put the spy back on let's buy back on over here let's see we're at 470 so"
"3034630","3040230"," I'm not I'm not bullish here just so you guys know I think we're coming down into the close I"
"3040230","3045830"," think they're parking this I think they're loading it up to park it into the close so that they can"
"3045830","3053850"," so that banks can exercise and I think we're going to pull back into tomorrow that's my honest"
"3053850","3063010"," opinion but if you were feeling frisky and you didn't want to lose your bank take on some risk and"
"3063010","3068550"," something that would have a chance to recover into Monday sometimes I'll take these that these"
"3068550","3074290"," aren't really lotos they're kind of like protected lotos so what you can do is you buy a lot of"

"3115750","3121290"," Friday due to we've recovered on Friday due to CPI I guess if that this is if you're already"

"3127810","3134970"," recovering your losses if the trade didn't go your way so I think that one's possible 470 it'll be"
"3134970","3142450"," 474 or 475s they're in the realm of possibility of something happening or us of us going up over"

"3991290","3993010"," It'd be hilarious if it closed the 1075. "
"3993550","3996530"," If it came within that 1077 number, it'd be hilarious."
"3999310","4000430"," We're close, right?"
"4000870","4001670"," We are so close."
"4002630","4004510"," If we tag that into the close, it'd be wild. "
"4009070","4017770"," And you see some, you see that you've got some VIX puts coming in, VXX puts coming in, 122320s."

"4055660","4063600"," Yeah, right in this zone right here, this zone right here has me."
"4068460","4069660"," And this is risky."
"4070140","4071980"," We're starting in some risky territory here. "
"4072640","4078320"," Now, I'm one of the guys that says VIX should be buried, but you can see, you guys need to"
"4078320","4079360"," see that where we are."
"4081940","4084000"," You know, we're burying the VIX straight down."
"4087930","4091050"," You see this beautiful run right here, right, all the way down to 14. "
"4091670","4098290"," This would seem to say, right, you can see this from the middle of October to the October."
"4098630","4103029"," So this is OPEX for October down here at the 21st."
"4103050","4104649"," You can see that VIX just got buried. "
"4107569","4109990"," And that's what bulls are hoping for down here."
"4109990","4110830"," You keep burying it."
"4117430","4127149"," So if you're still bullish right now, see this selldown that we're having right"
"4127149","4127450"," now?"
"4128010","4132350"," Hopefully you guys get this message before it stops, but if you see this selldown right here,"
"4133750","4138210"," sometimes the option, if you're bullish right now, the options contracts will get cheaper. "
"4138710","4143529"," We'll get another bounce down below and inside of this close here, you can sometimes get options in"
"4143529","4149910"," the last minute for 14, 4, 15, you can buy calls really cheap, okay?"
"4150470","4155069"," Because you'll see that now that we're selling, we tagged 470, you're definitely going to see bulls"
"4155069","4159510"," stepping in at this point, and they are going to want to, they're going to want to sell this down"
"4159510","4160910"," a little bit, the bear is without a doubt."
"4162050","4168490"," 470, congratulations, amazing tags, amazing tags for today."

"4185029","4186090"," hold the market up, that's good."
"4186430","4194550"," You guys are good, 1217, 175, 1210, I would have played 1213s and I probably would have played,"
"4195250","4197170"," yeah I guess the 17s would work."
"4197170","4202450"," 17s are good, that's probably the next nearest expiration date to OPEX. "
"4206450","4211690"," So watch this close right now, just wait to buy this close, if you're bullish you want to buy this"
"4211690","4217830"," close, you can buy it at like 4, 14, 4, 15, it's also good to see if they're buying in"
