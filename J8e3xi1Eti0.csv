"60840","62040"," Give me a quick quick second. "
"62340","65340"," I had to power surges."
"67300","68180"," It's kind of wild."

"97090","97570"," Okay. "
"98570","98950"," So there we go."
"99090","100090"," Make sure you guys are on the right stream."
"100330","104850"," I've got I enlisted the other two streams that apologize for what happened. "
"107250","108730"," I had a two power streams."
"109210","109590"," All right."
"109750","114570"," I had two power surges at two power streams at two power surges that hit my house. "
"115590","117050"," All lights, everything went off."
"119890","120530"," So, okay."
"120790","121890"," Let's get back to where we're at. "
"123390","124090"," Kind of weird."
"125990","126810"," We're back, right?"
"126970","127690"," You guys can see me."
"130190","132230"," Go back to book map real quick for you guys. "
"137640","139120"," That was kind of fucking wonky."
"147390","149050"," I always spooked and that shit happens."
"150310","152630"," I was like, oh shit. "
"153030","153350"," Okay."
"153510","153770"," Here we go."
"154830","155390"," We're back. "
"158680","159960"," My face is frozen."
"163300","164320"," Give me just a second here."
"183680","184600"," Let's see if that's frozen. "
"192920","193900"," Let's see how that goes."
"204510","206930"," Let me check the mainstream and see if."
"209310","209930"," All right. "
"210090","210990"," You guys can see me now, right?"
"211190","211330"," We're good."
"212290","212630"," Oh yeah."
"212790","212990"," Look at that. "
"213110","215030"," I'm reset to a hold on a second here."
"216810","217550"," Hang tight."
"250360","251240"," Come on now. "
"259399","260120"," Hold on a second."
"284220","284800"," All right."
"284940","287960"," This is the best it's going to be for just now. "
"288440","290740"," I've got all my all my shit reset itself."
"291520","292260"," So whatever."
"293340","294460"," This is going to have to work. "
"298660","300980"," Yeah, I've got a Canon A."
"301960","308500"," I've got a Canon A 6000 or 7000 or something with like the back."
"309100","310100"," Yeah, the back."
"310400","313420"," So if you got someone of these days, I do a video where I show you my setup here. "
"313440","314420"," That's pretty cool."
"316360","317320"," Yeah, it's pretty good."
"317680","318720"," It's pretty good setup. "
"322540","323020"," Whatever."
"323340","324400"," I'm not going to fuck with it right now."
"324600","331800"," What I did was I took the camera down and I was taking pictures of my pictures of family. "
"334360","339180"," So I teach my daughters how to use DSLR camera and."
"340680","344080"," I think robbing gangster squad teach the kids and all that kind of stuff."
"347960","350000"," Let's let's look back at spy real quick. "
"353750","355610"," So I was kind of offline here for a minute."
"358940","360360"," Oh yeah, look at that, huh?"
"368580","370020"," You might be getting some rule."
"372820","374220"," We'll keep an eye on the market right now. "
"374240","374860"," I'm not going to buy this."
"376100","376920"," Let's have a look."
"379960","382880"," So we didn't get a chance to look around the market. "
"383040","384000"," So let's look around the market."
"384760","388900"," There's 140,000 calls on four for four zero two."
"389580","391420"," All the puts are now gone on the market. "
"391520","392980"," I want you to know that nobody's got puts."
"394320","397460"," So there's all this money tied up in four zero two."
"401750","402550"," Still more buyers. "
"403050","403470"," Where's my coffee?"
"404770","406310"," Well, let me have a coffee break real quick."
"410680","414820"," Well, I always say that I'm going on a break, but I don't take a break."
"420960","422600"," Jason, I'll answer that question in just a moment. "
"430760","431980"," Hey, Lord, how are you?"
"436720","438020"," Who are you grabbing there, Winky?"
"438220","439080"," You grabbing calls right here?"
"439220","440700"," No, I think it's put time, bro."
"442580","444520"," We'll talk about that, Jason."
"445120","447840"," So Jason, watch the Larry Williams video you shared. "
"448820","449080"," Very good."
"449180","452800"," If Tesla is on that downwards trend, what kind of catalysts can stop that?"
"453440","455680"," Jason's got a really good question here."
"457080","458940"," And we'll give the answer. "
"459560","460800"," There are some simple ways."
"465140","466980"," Jason's asking a very valid question."
"466980","469280"," And people complicate this. "
"472040","473940"," People complicate the answer to this question."
"475940","476780"," All the time."
"479000","481780"," Now, there's a decoupling right now of Tesla from. "
"484330","485890"," From the stack market."
"485910","487210"," Okay, so we'll talk about that."
"488350","489730"," I think we're going to roll over here. "
"491850","494370"," I don't like that everybody's in call on the call side right now."
"494370","496130"," If you're a bear, get ready."
"499050","500070"," This is looking like distribution. "
"500510","501970"," We'll see if it is distribution or not."
"503650","505850"," If you're a bear, you want to know when to start taking this."
"506290","507650"," I'll show you when to start taking this. "
"507810","507930"," Ready?"
"509010","511370"," I'm going to show you when to take this right here, right?"
"512090","513210"," You're going to wait for a breakthrough."
"514830","516350"," And I want you to see where to take this."
"516830","517650"," See this breakthrough?"
"519289","521850"," Little pump, and this is the real money move right here. "
"528310","529390"," So I'll keep my eyes on this."
"529470","530230"," I'll buy some puts with you."
"534230","535590"," We'll keep an eye on this right now. "
"535830","537110"," Everybody's on the call side right now."
"537390","537790"," Not good."
"538610","539450"," Don't like seeing that. "
"542710","544510"," And see this blue line right here?"
"545090","547010"," This is where you would see it would go to something like that."
"549190","550570"," That's what you're looking for if you're a bear."
"556290","558630"," So Jason's asking a very fair question, right?"
"561290","562930"," So this is what we'll look at it. "
"564390","566290"," There's three things you want to be looking for, Jason."
"566790","567730"," You got a downward trend."
"568870","569430"," Hold on. "
"571150","574050"," We're going to downward trend on Tesla, right?"
"577010","578310"," Oh, yeah, look at that."
"579110","579650"," Blood red."
"580510","581730"," Blood red for the bears. "
"583470","584690"," Blood red for the bears."
"586050","591850"," Remember, we have the 100% move down, 50% retracement, 100% move down, 50% retracement, right?"
"594330","596010"," So that's your first indicator, right?"
"596150","603150"," If you break this channel, if you just break out of that downward channel on Tesla, that would be"
"603150","604470"," the first thing you're looking for, right?"
"604470","607370"," So you have blood red, blood red."
"608410","611610"," Remember we talked about break, break Vwap rejection. "
"612850","613630"," Then you take the short."
"614590","616390"," Take the short here."
"617990","618790"," Not here. "
"619930","621330"," Take this one right here."
"624460","629340"," So if there's a short typically right, I'll show you where the, where you usually, usually pick it"
"629340","629460"," up."
"630520","631240"," Break Vwap, right?"
"631920","632540"," It comes back up. "
"634320","635320"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"636220","639200"," If it just starts going, normally I'd like to take it."
"639320","641020"," This is the trade that I like to take us right there. "
"642860","646600"," But only because I don't want to grab the, I don't want that to happen."
"648160","649920"," Blood red in the market right now."
"650560","651520"," Blood red. "
"655990","658610"," Did any of you guys buy those cheap puts?"
"661210","662710"," Did any guys buy cheap puts?"
"663810","664630"," Blood red."
"667470","669470"," Tool look for is right here, right?"
"671650","674850"," This is the part of the trade that's where the money is right there."
"676730","677810"," That's where the money is at. "
"682120","683600"," That's where the money is right here."
"685680","687940"," Well, let's do some price targets down below."
"694310","696890"," There's your first price target right on that blue line right there. "
"701650","709840"," Price target down below, 398.39. First PT right here, second PT right here."
"710900","713080"," Now there's a little bump in the road right here as well."
"715730","716610"," Here's your price targets. "
"718010","718770"," Let's see what happens here."
"727680","732400"," PT1, PT2, PT3."
"735240","736620"," I'll show you guys how to trade a bear trade. "
"737340","739860"," When this snaps back up here, you want to see a failure."
"740440","741680"," This is the actual trade."
"742340","744300"," This is where you actually take the trade, the rejection. "
"745960","748280"," Then we get our first and second and third move down."
"748960","751080"," You guys understand how you trade a bear trade?"
"752440","755600"," So right here you want to see PT1 right here, BAM."
"756660","757500"," You want to see rejection. "
"757500","760640"," This is the meat of the trade right here."
"763100","765700"," The rejection is where the money is right here."
"769220","770480"," That's where the money in the trade is. "
"779230","779850"," Blood red."
"780890","782490"," You don't want to get caught in this though."
"783830","788150"," So if you want to take a bear trade right and let's say you took it right here, and it"
"788150","789510"," bounces back up, you'll get fucked. "
"790090","790870"," That's how you get trapped."
"791350","792570"," It's our bear trap."
"793510","799190"," If you're looking to take the bear trade, you're always looking for the initial down, and then a"
"799190","801270"," rejection for the big move down. "
"802090","805690"," So you take the trade here, not the initial weakness."
"806850","808390"," Always the second move down."
"808850","812390"," If you hold that rule, you might not catch every trade. "
"813890","819010"," Sometimes you'll have a straight down, and you'll miss that trade."
"819010","827510"," But if you have the rule that you wait for the bounce and rejection, you'll win more times than not"
"827510","828030"," if you're a bear."
"828590","829850"," It's not easy being a bear. "
"830530","837310"," So if you have, like my hard and fast rule is that for initial move down, I don't take that"
"837310","837550"," trade."
"838090","840090"," I'm waiting for it to come back up and reject."
"841650","848150"," This is, if it rejects here, you just, you have your finger on the TQ or SQQ TQ or spy"
"848150","851450"," puts, whatever it is, and this is where the real move is. "
"851750","856670"," And pre-plan as it's setting itself up, you start, when you see this initial move, right?"
"857510","861430"," You say to yourself, okay, I'm going to start, I'm going to start a short, or I'm going to start"
"861430","863690"," a put position in spy."
"864090","865610"," So you have all this time right here."
"865990","871630"," And what you're going to do is you're going to look for where, where the bears need to hold, right?"
"872630","878530"," Sometimes you'll miss it, but if it, if it does come back up, starts to fail and come back down. "
"878530","884110"," And then I'm going to set yourself up for some price targets, because you might get like bounces"
"884110","884790"," along the way."
"884790","887750"," You might, what you might get is one move here, right?"
"887970","889270"," Comes back up, another move here."
"889590","890970"," Then it comes back up, keeps moving down. "
"891410","893190"," But you can at least like buy puts or shorts."
"894070","899430"," Take your money, wait, wait for a reset, take your money, wait for a reset as we, as we elevate"
"899430","899930"," it down."
"900830","901610"," Make sense?"
"902770","904010"," Any bears in here?"
"911170","920180"," Let's look on, let's confirm this on, I mean a second, we'll confirm this on look map. "
"935440","937060"," Real support on the spy."
"937660","942840"," If you want to know where real support is, 3970."
"954650","955630"," That's real support. "
"959550","966760"," So 3970, which is even lower than we are."
"967260","970980"," So real support, so you guys know this one, you guys can see this real quick, okay?"
"973420","977440"," 3970, and that would translate to 3970396."
"983220","985080"," It's actually lower, it's like right here, ready?"
"993810","994770"," 3966, right here. "
"999580","1001860"," Right here is real support, right here, we'll show it to you."
"1003280","1004540"," That's real support right there."
"1006560","1007680"," Let me show you where it is. "
"1008700","1009240"," Here we go."
"1009240","1011960"," So this is real support right here."
"1013420","1015080"," We're starting to break this break. "
"1015600","1017080"," Let's see if we can tag it right here."
"1018620","1022120"," Tag it right here, and this is where real support is, down here."
"1028359","1032140"," Blood red, right real support. "
"1040119","1045960"," Save it, change this to green."
"1047460","1048880"," That's real support down here."
"1052240","1061980"," Blood red, blood blood"
"1061980","1062580"," red. "
"1063440","1064340"," We can raise this up."
"1065460","1066840"," This is really where open was right here."
"1071390","1072810"," I guess that was kind of the open. "
"1073090","1074190"," I thought the open was down here."
"1075290","1076870"," I thought the open was right here."
"1079590","1081070"," Oh, that's the previous close. "
"1081890","1083570"," This is the opening price right here."
"1084850","1087350"," We'll snap it to the line for previous close."
"1091930","1093830"," Yeah, that was 39998. "
"1094110","1095350"," So this is the previous close right here."
"1095950","1097350"," This is the opening price."
"1099010","1109880"," Oh, shit. "
"1120640","1122980"," Opening price right here, that just bloodbath at it."
"1123720","1124960"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"1125420","1126260"," Blood, blood red. "
"1126500","1128420"," Hopefully, today you guys getting those puts."
"1129160","1129920"," That didn't buy any."
"1132660","1133440"," Look at that. "
"1133760","1134560"," Oh, yeah."
"1135540","1138260"," Oh, and you can see it right here, right?"
"1138420","1139880"," They went right under that yellow bar."
"1140080","1140820"," Look at this yellow bar. "
"1141600","1142040"," Boom."
"1142640","1143000"," Hit it again."
"1145480","1145920"," Damn. "
"1146200","1147900"," The opening price now, we're right on the printer."
"1148100","1150620"," This is the previous opening price."
"1150900","1152060"," This is yesterday's opening price. "
"1152600","1153400"," Hold on, man."
"1155290","1157530"," Well, bears have some bear town right here."
"1157910","1160290"," The previous closing price just nailed it. "
"1160850","1162730"," This is the opening price right here."
"1163310","1163950"," It's a little bit lower."
"1164290","1165310"," It's like right here. "
"1167250","1168030"," Oh, yeah."
"1168330","1168590"," Blood red."
"1168850","1169930"," Real support down below. "
"1171010","1172050"," Blood red."
"1173390","1174230"," Blood red."
"1174410","1175170"," That whole move erased. "
"1176570","1177270"," Gone, baby."
"1177550","1177770"," Gone."
"1178410","1179790"," Whole move from open. "
"1180850","1181150"," Whoop."
"1181570","1182390"," Gone, baby."
"1184830","1185890"," Thankfully I was flat. "
"1188150","1188890"," Blood red."
"1193200","1193920"," Blood red."
"1194300","1195720"," You guys want to look at the book map real quick?"
"1196140","1197360"," You guys have a snapshot of this?"
"1198520","1199240"," Blood red. "
"1200340","1201080"," There's book map."
"1201260","1202620"," You guys want to see what could happen here?"
"1204080","1205400"," So this is opening, right?"
"1206420","1207720"," Got a pound stop opening."
"1208480","1209140"," Bears want to. "
"1209300","1210620"," Bears want to see this reject."
"1212020","1216880"," Take it down to 398.39. Blood red."
"1218740","1219520"," Blood red. "
"1219520","1220120"," Blood red."
"1221100","1223100"," Hopefully some of you guys bought those cheap puts."
"1223240","1226020"," I saw someone in the chat earlier said they bought some of those cheap puts. "
"1227220","1228440"," I saw someone in the chat."

"1544960","1545980"," For us to go down here. "
"1547940","1548740"," Absolutely easy."
"1554760","1556320"," Absolutely easy for us to go down there."

"1581300","1584540"," They're going to be looking for some rejection here and here."
"1584700","1585580"," My cursor is."
"1587360","1590780"," Trying to keep the stock price down into the two PM. "
"1596080","1597520"," Into the two PM hour."
"1597820","1601180"," Trying to get it down to the pivot point down a S one."
"1601460","1602800"," Bears love to see that move. "

"1621480","1622600"," Time using it."
"1622840","1625060"," I watched videos book map itself."
"1625660","1628580"," Has a daily live stream, but it's really extensive. "
"1630460","1632040"," I've watched a few of them, but I."
"1632760","1637100"," I've watched people describe how to how to use book map on YouTube."
"1637100","1638260"," Like find tutorials."
"1640400","1641520"," That helped a lot. "
"1646340","1647220"," What I find."
"1648000","1649440"," We'll do a video one day."
"1649640","1651520"," We'll go through and do the settings together. "
"1653560","1655260"," Because the settings really matter."
"1656080","1656580"," I don't have."
"1656860","1657480"," I don't show. "
"1657940","1659820"," I used to show more balls on my chart."
"1661320","1663540"," On my book map chart, and now I."
"1664040","1667440"," I've limited how many like I want just large buy and sell orders."
"1667960","1671740"," So when you see the balls show up on my book map, it's very large orders. "
"1673380","1675880"," Because I thought there was too much noise on it."
"1680710","1683430"," That we still have buyers in this market just heads up here."
"1684790","1687390"," Yeah, it's not it's it's slowing down. "
"1687530","1691010"," So now we have we only have three thousand more buyers and sellers."
"1691010","1693750"," So it's weakening the buyers are weakening."
"1694410","1695190"," So we'll see. "
"1695770","1697510"," See if they can get a rejection off this."
"1705920","1708600"," Buyers aren't as strong as they were earlier."
"1709700","1712820"," There's like six six to nine thousand buyers above. "
"1714780","1718180"," Like this move right here had had massive buyers."
"1719100","1721520"," And then the and you can look at that in the bottom right hand."
"1721640","1722580"," Oh, you guys can't see it. "
"1723360","1724300"," Down here are."
"1727100","1728540"," This is important right here."
"1729000","1733800"," And then this this is important right here because you can see where large sell orders are where"
"1733800","1735820"," large buy orders are. "
"1736660","1739200"," We should have looked at that for this tag to we didn't."
"1739540","1740880"," I should have done that with you guys."
"1741020","1742320"," I didn't. "
"1742320","1744000"," We're large standing orders are to buy."
"1748510","1750130"," Bull's trying to try to maintain."
"1750550","1752450"," You can see here bulls trying to hold on here. "
"1752670","1754030"," You can see that this is where the cell."
"1754490","1757250"," This is about where the sellers if we switch over right now."
"1758010","1761190"," You can see that some sellers are coming in right where my cursor is. "
"1762130","1763230"," I'll switch back and forth."
"1764170","1766930"," Well, but there are some sellers right here."
"1768250","1771470"," And I'll switch back to book back so you can see that. "
"1772910","1776430"," See that orange line above where the green ball is."
"1778590","1780330"," The sellers have come down."
"1781730","1784190"," So let me let me translate that for you. "
"1784190","1787470"," So this line right here sellers have pushed down to here now."
"1788750","1790530"," They're trying to hold right here."
"1790830","1793030"," I might buy some puts. "
"1793770","1794930"," Let me look at some puts real quick."
"1798910","1803150"," Yeah, those so what do we so the three ninety eight you guys ready three ninety eight P's."
"1803690","1805250"," They're now thirty four cents. "
"1806070","1808170"," They were probably up to sixty cents at one point."
"1809090","1811810"," They were as low as like ten cents earlier."
"1813950","1816310"," Three ninety nine P's are now fifty three cents. "
"1816550","1819350"," We talked about the price of these earlier today."
"1820050","1821870"," You guys go back to the original stream."
"1824250","1828430"," And so the so the sellers are trying to maintain there. "
"1829170","1830090"," This right here."
"1834650","1840850"," And we'll go back to sellers trying to get actually this line is gone right here."
"1840850","1846250"," They're breaking the buyers are stepping right into by this market. "
"1848950","1853930"," We'll see if the if the sellers are still in charge here or not."
"1857890","1859850"," So you guys can see it on the main."
"1861790","1865470"," See if the see if the sellers are still in charge or not. "
"1865550","1866590"," You'll know quickly."
"1867910","1871110"," If the sellers are still in charge if you see a squeeze above here."
"1871810","1872610"," So watch my cursor. "
"1873630","1874430"," You see the bulls."
"1875950","1877210"," Let me switch the color here."
"1882810","1883850"," This one right here. "
"1884730","1885050"," That'll work."
"1886010","1888790"," If you see the bulls come above here."
"1890130","1891210"," They're going to try to make a push. "
"1891990","1896470"," You want to see the bears maintain charge here and send this back down."
"1897630","1898650"," Let's see if they can do it."
"1900410","1902270"," So those puts paid very well. "
"1902530","1904610"," Those puts were worthless somewhere up in here."
"1904850","1905170"," They were like."
"1906270","1906950"," Ten cents. "
"1907370","1910230"," A couple of them we talked about were like ten twenty cents."
"1910490","1911570"," They made some bank in here."
"1912610","1914210"," It's like a hit and run robbery, right?"
"1917370","1918410"," Hit and run robbery. "
"1921630","1923010"," Bull's finding some support now."
"1923250","1925690"," Well, at least book maps saying that bulls are finding some support."
"1926610","1928030"," See if they can hold it or not. "
"1930850","1932350"," See if we get a rug pull or not."
"1932610","1935550"," Keep your eyes on the order flow on the right hand side of your screen."
"1936210","1937490"," I think it's the right hand side of your screen. "
"1942620","1944260"," At four zero two zero."
"1944540","1945900"," There's a large cell order there."
"1946080","1946580"," You see it?"
"1948460","1949380"," Two hundred and twelve. "
"1949520","1950000"," I think it says."
"1953540","1954820"," I'm going to take your attention."
"1955080","1955780"," There's a way to see this. "
"1955940","1956100"," Okay."
"1959570","1960070"," So right here."
"1960270","1961330"," See my cursor over here. "
"1962970","1964670"," There's a large cell order right here."
"1964770","1964930"," Okay."
"1966970","1968390"," Now it's very weak. "
"1970050","1972250"," Above to four zero four."
"1973150","1974810"," Where my cursor is up there."
"1975070","1979770"," So I'm going to translate that to you right now on the mainstream. "
"1980130","1981270"," So right here where we are, right?"
"1982010","1984350"," There's a large block of sellers right here."
"1986250","1991170"," And there's not another large block of sellers until way up here."
"1991170","1991830"," Like above. "
"1994810","1998210"," So you're going to see the reversal down."
"1998590","2000730"," Or you're going to see a pretty big move higher."
"2001090","2002290"," You should see a pretty big move higher. "
"2002430","2004710"," We've got a very weak bull."
"2005090","2007730"," Bears are very weak above here I should say."
"2008990","2012690"," Our bears are weak here and they're strong right here. "
"2014790","2017110"," So we have your finger on some puts here."
"2017530","2020890"," So if we start to roll over here you can grab some puts."
"2021910","2022990"," Let me figure on the trigger. "
"2038050","2038810"," Hope that helps."
"2042670","2046430"," And keep your eye up the dome back up or the order flow back up so you can see."
"2047429","2048570"," Bears are getting weak here. "
"2049989","2051830"," You see the numbers changing right now."
"2052989","2053750"," It was in the two hundreds."
"2053989","2054909"," Now it's down to one hundreds. "
"2060530","2062150"," Four zero two zeros weakening right now."
"2090210","2093830"," See four zero fours or fifteen cents."
"2100080","2101380"," Let's see. "
"2102140","2102600"," Bye."
"2109360","2110100"," There's ten."
"2117420","2118960"," I'm looking at four zero two. "
"2119540","2120000"," See."
"2122340","2123620"," They're fifty nine cents."
"2124660","2126780"," Speed up your playback right here so you're live stream with me. "
"2127280","2127800"," You caught right up."
"2127920","2128900"," Go to the little gear icon."
"2131920","2137840"," Go to the little gear icon here and speed up your playback so you're live stream with right now. "
"2138100","2141920"," I've got our four zero two c's and in first fifty nine cents."
"2150590","2152950"," Speed up the playback so you're real time with me live streaming."
"2158300","2159620"," Still have some sellers here. "
"2159700","2160700"," We might end up reversing here."
"2160920","2162060"," Be careful if you're in calls."
"2162060","2164540"," There's more sellers coming in right here. "
"2164580","2166100"," They're trying to trap their bulls."
"2172750","2174230"," I'm going to switch to a sell here."
"2174330","2175450"," I might get out of this trade. "
"2176970","2178470"," If you're along here with me."
"2178890","2180110"," This is a very dangerous trade."
"2180290","2180430"," Okay. "
"2183170","2184110"," Very dangerous."
"2184710","2185490"," Have some stops."
"2185790","2186990"," I think we're robbing gangsters. "
"2187310","2188090"," Four zero twos."
"2188590","2190610"," Put a stop loss of fifty eight cents."
"2202030","2203450"," Because we could reverse here quickly. "
"2204750","2206030"," Be the old bull trap."
"2208670","2209990"," I just figured out."
"2210370","2211090"," I'm flat again. "
"2214190","2215570"," Be really careful here."
"2217410","2218610"," I'll try to re-enter again."
"2218770","2219890"," Hold on. "
"2223370","2224790"," Two, two, five, six, three, ten."
"2226130","2229710"," Some bears are going to try to fucking bull trap this bull shit right here."
"2235440","2236860"," Equal buyers, equal sellers. "
"2239460","2240220"," Be a big move."
"2240340","2241340"," We're going to get a pretty big move here."
"2241840","2243500"," We're either going pretty high or we're going to go pretty low. "
"2246480","2247820"," I need to look around now."
"2248100","2250720"," I need to look at other tickers and see what they're saying."
"2252680","2254320"," This is a good time to be looking at. "
"2254640","2254960"," Yeah."
"2255320","2256300"," J&K is rolling over."
"2256980","2257940"," Be really careful here. "
"2259400","2260960"," HIG looks like it's wants to roll over."
"2262120","2263540"," Dixie's found some support."
"2265680","2267100"," Let's look at the VIX real quick. "
"2271820","2274540"," Whenever you're in doubt in these moves right here."
"2275460","2277560"," It's always not, it's not never a bad idea."
"2278000","2283060"," We tagged 2077 on the VIX and had a huge spike up. "
"2287160","2288360"," Bears wanted to defend."
"2288740","2294880"," Bears wanted to fad, well, VIX bulls wanted to defend 2123."
"2296980","2298700"," 2123 VIX bulls wanted to defend it. "
"2300780","2304180"," HYZ and J&K is looking a little toppy man and I'm telling you."
"2305400","2306540"," Doing a little toppy, right?"
"2316440","2317400"," Come on, bulls."
"2320260","2321180"," Man, I don't know. "
"2321440","2322280"," I'm going to buy some puts."
"2322460","2322940"," Fuck that noise."
"2323280","2327620"," I'm looking at it all around the market right now and I'm like, hell no. "
"2330650","2332030"," Hold on a second."
"2332110","2333770"," I got to see where price target is down below."
"2335450","2336530"," 399, let's say?"
"2336830","2337630"," No, 398. "
"2338470","2338510"," What?"
"2339050","2340570"," How much is 398's cost right now?"
"2342810","2343510"," Goddamn, dude."
"2343930","2344730"," Fucking bears, man."
"2345630","2347590"," Those 398's I think were like 10 cents earlier. "
"2347870","2349790"," Now they want 32 cents for them."
"2351070","2351810"," Goddamn bears."
"2352470","2353190"," I'm not paying that. "
"2355950","2358690"," I'm not paying fucking premium on your fucking puts."
"2369860","2372260"," I'm not paying fucking 30 cents, man."
"2372520","2373800"," They were like 10 cents earlier. "
"2375260","2380480"," More than 397s were 10 cents and I think maybe the 398s were 20, but they went up to like"
"2380480","2381320"," 60 fucking cents."
"2381800","2384920"," This was a, this was like a 300% print on those puts."
"2386100","2387280"," It's a pretty good fucking print. "
"2388200","2388660"," It's pretty juicy."
"2388660","2392220"," That's why I think we're going up because of the print that came off this."
"2392880","2394160"," It was pretty fucking fat. "
"2395660","2396840"," Pretty fucking fat print."
"2397420","2398660"," It's not going to lie."
"2400540","2403300"," You would take your money and run if you were a bear. "
"2410160","2411520"," The trade was up here."
"2411680","2412300"," We know that, right?"
"2413840","2415840"," Throw some fucking puts on just in case."
"2418560","2421480"," So this trade printed like 300%. "
"2422360","2423600"," It's a pretty good fucking trade."
"2423940","2424540"," I didn't buy any puts."
"2425020","2429460"," I'm not paying attention close enough for the market to be consistently trading. "
"2429640","2431380"," I'm going back and forth between these tickers or people."
"2431580","2434380"," So I'm fearful of shit like this happening."
"2441420","2444340"," The low on pre 98's was 11 cents. "
"2446580","2451240"," Yeah, and those were up to like 50, 60 cents, weren't they?"
"2451680","2452980"," Just like down here."
"2454080","2455380"," They were fucking cranking."
"2459140","2460240"," He took the money and ran. "
"2460360","2464940"," Yeah, if you were up, if you were in the trade up here, you took this money and ran."
"2465320","2465720"," Guaranteed."
"2466220","2470620"," That's the only thing that's the only argument the bulls have is this is a hit and run. "
"2471880","2473820"," And it re prices calls, I guess."
"2474040","2474840"," That's what I would be thinking."
"2476620","2479040"," You can see the green balls coming in right now. "
"2479160","2480600"," Buyers are stepping in on book map."
"2480600","2481900"," Be conscious of this right here."
"2483000","2484060"," See those green balls. "
"2485600","2488900"," So be conscious of these buyers stepping in right here."
"2495580","2497220"," Could get a squeeze higher right now."
"2507400","2510760"," Can you post the screen post shot like?"
"2510920","2511320"," Yeah, of course. "
"2513000","2517520"," I don't think I don't know if I allow that or not in my my stream."
"2517820","2518860"," I had to like set."
"2520040","2522860"," I have to set like parameters on the stream and say, yes, you can do that. "
"2523040","2524060"," No, you can't do that."
"2525220","2526140"," You know what you want to do?"
"2527540","2529760"," You can post it to my name on Twitter if you want."
"2529880","2530340"," I'll look at it. "
"2538380","2539120"," Oh, fuck yeah."
"2539240","2540380"," Okay, goose, we got to get together, bro."
"2540940","2541340"," Let's get it. "
"2541480","2542380"," Let's get a bourbon one time."
"2543840","2544960"," Let's get together for sure."
"2547920","2548360"," Definitely. "
"2550920","2555820"," So harm saying that a million puts were sold when calls just flooded in."
"2559540","2562100"," Three ninety eights went for eleven cents to sixty two cents."
"2563120","2564280"," Tuck a beautiful thing, right?"
"2564740","2565780"," It's a gorgeous hit and run. "
"2566620","2568360"," I mean, this is a this trade right here is unreal."
"2569160","2570280"," I wish I had bought some puts."
"2573000","2577660"," I mean, the earlier we were talking about it, we're saying they're ten cents. "
"2578000","2578700"," They're dirt cheap."
"2578700","2580800"," There's no reason not to buy them."
"2583080","2584400"," Even if you were long calls. "
"2584760","2589740"," And as a matter of fact, if you were caught long calls up in here and had purchased ten ten"
"2589740","2594100"," cent protection, you should be fucking have made bank."
"2595120","2597060"," You should have made bank right here, no matter what."
"2598440","2599940"," And don't sell your calls. "
"2600740","2604420"," Well, I'm saying, well, if you got caught holding the calls here, you would still hold them."
"2606000","2609320"," And you would have made bank here, cash these out."
"2609960","2611500"," And then hope that this comes back. "
"2611780","2615340"," Now, if you're a bull and your cotton just calls only right here, I'll tell you this."
"2617140","2621820"," Whenever we're caught in here, they're going to reprice your calls and then they're not going to"
"2621820","2627360"," want you the market makers will like bring us up here."
"2629060","2632780"," And come back down, then come back up, come back down. "
"2632780","2636160"," And what'll happen is they'll just kill your calls."
"2637100","2644660"," So if and when we get back to here, if and when you get back to this point right here,"
"2644920","2652460"," let's say your position was a dollar, your calls will then be worth like 70 cents or something to"
"2652460","2657120"," be down usually like 30% of whatever you were holding up in here."
"2660400","2665200"," So if there is a retrace up in here, if you didn't have puts and you didn't get out of"
"2665200","2669900"," your calls, normally what I would do is if we trade up here, sometimes you'll make your money back"
"2669900","2670480"," later on. "
"2670940","2672740"," But most of the time, 60% of the time you won't."
"2672900","2678080"," So what you do is you get out of your calls up here at 70 cents, you'll see bull selling"
"2678080","2678860"," here as well."
"2680440","2686500"," And you'll lick your wounds and go to the next trade and try to make that 30 cents back that"
"2686500","2686780"," you lost. "
"2687640","2688500"," I don't know if that helps."
"2690960","2695680"," Anyone that took those puts though fucking congratulations out fucking standing."
"2705930","2706970"," But that's down the road. "
"2707090","2708550"," You guys should always be thinking about this stuff."
"2710490","2714330"," If we do go up if your cotton calls, if you didn't have puts that kind of stuff."
"2716490","2718190"," And yes, if I was caught in this. "
"2720030","2723610"," If I was caught, if I had calls right here, right, let's say I was stuck in, or I was"
"2723610","2726030"," in calls, let's say I just bought this right here."
"2728110","2730070"," And we started rolling over, right?"
"2730970","2733590"," My whole plan would be, well, I missed this whole move."
"2734490","2737550"," Let's say I didn't trigger some put buying over here over here. "
"2738090","2739130"," So I just got caught in this."
"2740330","2741950"," I'm holding calls right now."
"2742070","2745850"," I'm hoping to praying that I can get out of my position right around here. "
"2748190","2749450"," That whatever loss that is."
"2750790","2755310"," And you've got, what do you call it working against you as a day moves on?"
"2755790","2760050"," Now, this being an event day, it's possible you can hold them all day long."
"2760850","2765710"," I don't want to be 70 or 30% down on my calls cap. "
"2766210","2768570"," Because today is an event day where you could possibly do."
"2769050","2771430"," But I think you're still going to get fucked even worse."
"2772090","2777230"," As you can wait for the event and hope and pray that we go ballistic. "
"2777230","2781830"," But I think even if we do go ballistic, you might get back to 70% still again."
"2781870","2786710"," You would have wasted your entire day truck chasing that 30 cents on the dollar or whatever it is."
"2802550","2804950"," My 10 cent protection is how I got my second child. "
"2807770","2808610"," Yeah, I think we dip."
"2808810","2809570"," I think we trade sideways."
"2810050","2814710"," If we want my normal, normally what happens on event days is we sell off like we did at some"
"2814710","2815150"," point, right?"
"2816170","2817050"," We'll be range bound. "
"2818170","2820510"," And we're going to get a large move up and a large move down."
"2820510","2821310"," We all know that, right?"
"2823190","2826970"," And then we'll pick a further direction for the next couple days."
"2829410","2832570"," Sometimes I like trading events, but they're very dangerous. "
"2832990","2836430"," It's easy for you to even pick the right direction and get caught at the wrong way."
"2836950","2838430"," Have bought the wrong place."
"2843360","2845760"," I've already told you guys this morning before they opened. "
"2845920","2847380"," I'm not a fan of trading event days."
"2848220","2850220"," And then I always recommend you don't trade them."
"2859020","2860600"," You get a hundred and seventy of viewers right now, right?"
"2860740","2861140"," The fuck on. "
"2861220","2861340"," I'm good."
"2861400","2861820"," Good morning."
"2862140","2865740"," If you're just joining us, we traded all this up over here. "
"2866320","2868520"," Let me just join us, trade all this up over here."
"2868540","2869040"," Those nonsense."
"2870220","2874300"," We felt as though this was either, you know, of course, we thought we thought that this was"
"2876640","2882160"," consolidation, not distribution, but we did call out that puts were dirt cheap. "
"2882580","2884620"," We were like, hey, it's their 10 cents right now."
"2885600","2889300"," And we even went through the options chain to see what the best ones to buy were."
"2889440","2895340"," And we said buy in the money, three eighties or excuse me, uh, three ninety eights, three ninety"
"2895340","2896100"," sevens. "
"2897580","2898720"," And how cheap they were."
"2898920","2901040"," They ended up printing like three hundred percent down here."
"2901260","2904760"," Some of them six hundred percent between three and six hundred percent. "
"2906760","2909080"," And as a matter of fact, I went flat somewhere in here."
"2909900","2911560"," So we did end up selling this down."
"2914830","2916350"," We've got an attitude two PM. "
"2919090","2920510"," Buyers are stepping back in the market."
"2920710","2922850"," We've got people in the chat saying they sold puts."
"2923170","2924530"," They hit those get hit and run from the bears. "
"2926370","2929830"," Anyone that's cotton calls is probably trying to get up here to cash out."
"2930190","2932510"," So be wary of hit this zone right here."
"2932570","2934010"," Be wary of like be wop. "
"2935190","2936610"," So I'm going to give you some targets."
"2936610","2946010"," Uh, 401.38 and 401.63. You're going to look for trap bulls to be trying to sell out of"
"2946010","2946430"," their positions."
"2947670","2952470"," That would send us up here and then back down here in another, another attempt. "
"2953390","2956770"," I'm going to assume it's something like this into the event."
"2958530","2961310"," So if you're a trap bull, that's your shot."
"2961530","2962290"," Can we trade iron this?"
"2962490","2962610"," Yes. "
"2963650","2964470"," There's no real."
"2964650","2965570"," There's no real."
"2965790","2971250"," If you look on book map, there's no real resistance to trading back up to 404. "
"2972950","2974510"," This looks very supportive, right?"
"2977030","2977850"," To go higher."
"2978730","2981670"," The only thing that I would tell you about that going higher point is that."
"2983250","2985130"," These fucking bulls when they get trapped. "
"2988230","2989770"," They won't put their sell order in."
"2989850","2990570"," They're just sitting there."
"2990570","2993170"," I know for a fact that there are probably bulls out there. "
"2994350","2994970"," They're like."
"2996070","2997590"," Praying on their hands and knees going."
"2997870","3000850"," Oh, please just get to like 70%. "
"3000850","3003190"," And they won't have sell orders."
"3003990","3007530"," And then all of a sudden they'll just slam the market with sell orders."
"3008050","3009510"," Fucking slam that sell button. "
"3012150","3013690"," So we'll see if they do that."
"3014390","3016310"," I'm going to bet there's hidden sellers right here."
"3017850","3018290"," 100%. "
"3018290","3020070"," I'm going to bet that there's hidden sellers in there."
"3021950","3022390"," Guaranteed."
"3027340","3028780"," Yeah, that's another thing to notice. "
"3028960","3031980"," Winky's saying I held calls for 715 minutes for to make seven bucks."
"3032740","3034420"," That's showing that there's no real buyers here."
"3038290","3039670"," I'm not buying anything in here. "
"3040050","3041010"," I'm flat right now."
"3041230","3044850"," So having gotten trapped at all today, I've made money all day long."
"3046410","3048190"," Market saying that we're going to roll over two. "
"3048450","3049270"," There's some weakness showing."
"3049270","3050510"," We'll show you the."
"3052930","3054690"," We'll take a walk around the market. "
"3056250","3056830"," And."
"3058810","3059710"," Look at that."
"3061630","3063050"," Look at that. "
"3063710","3064290"," Slammed."
"3065470","3067070"," Look at fix earlier today."
"3067410","3070930"," We drew this big box slammed almost into the almost the pin strike. "
"3071630","3072650"," See that shit."
"3074290","3075630"," Almost the pin strike."
"3076430","3078650"," Don't know why the box doesn't show up here, but. "
"3082510","3085230"," One hour chart, though, right there, pin strike, boom."
"3088730","3089210"," And."
"3091030","3095510"," I don't know why that box doesn't show up on a small timeframe, but we pin struck it. "
"3095870","3097250"," The larger time frames."
"3099950","3100430"," Bam."
"3101870","3102630"," Look at that. "
"3104050","3107870"," So bulls want to hold this gets to catch some volatility into the event."
"3109510","3111830"," We know we had sellers here, right?"
"3112090","3113330"," We know we had sellers here."
"3113470","3115490"," Sellers were my cursor is cursor is here. "
"3115910","3120070"," This is where the the market equity market bulls want to."
"3121250","3122770"," Hold this area right here."
"3125610","3129890"," That's what the that this is what the equity bulls want to hold. "
"3130270","3133470"," They don't want to see they don't want to see the VIX."
"3134690","3135950"," Start climbing up here."
"3136090","3136790"," This kind of nonsense. "
"3138090","3139770"," And you can see it right here, right?"
"3142510","3146050"," This is what the market bears want to see happen right here."
"3147550","3148370"," Market bears."
"3148770","3150350"," VIX bulls want to see that right there. "
"3150770","3152350"," Reclamation of this trend."
"3154690","3155170"," Right."
"3156090","3157830"," Tag down continuation up there. "
"3158410","3159110"," Something like that."
"3159290","3160590"," This is what the bears want."
"3160950","3162310"," Market bears want that right there. "
"3167180","3168260"," We'll take a look at."
"3170180","3171060"," Hold on here."
"3171680","3174360"," Take a look at bonds junk bonds. "
"3176140","3178680"," We know we're so we know we broke through above here."
"3178680","3180140"," We broke through above here again."
"3180800","3182920"," This is what going to tell the real story, right?"
"3184180","3187360"," The bit the market bulls want to see 90. "
"3188880","3189800"," 180 hold."
"3190460","3192920"," Look at that tag almost perfect here too."
"3192920","3193400"," You see that?"
"3194100","3198900"," Almost a perfect tag on 91.78. Almost perfect. "
"3199280","3199960"," Bulls want to hold this."
"3200900","3206120"," You can keep you can mark this on your own charts 91.79. It's a good HYG."
"3206800","3209020"," Almost a perfect clean tag here as well. "
"3210740","3212520"," We looked at this earlier this morning."
"3212900","3215840"," You want to see this hold and continuation for the bulls."
"3216720","3217560"," Let's move higher. "
"3219980","3221560"," We'll get back to the spy here."
"3222920","3224140"," Look at that nastiness."
"3224180","3224480"," Look at that. "
"3224660","3225460"," Look at that bar."
"3226760","3227560"," That's hilarious."
"3228920","3229980"," Gave it all back. "
"3234360","3235280"," Too funny."
"3236460","3238760"," Oh, what's going on over here?"
"3240020","3241920"," We got some weak ass bulls."
"3242900","3243680"," Oh, man. "
"3244560","3245600"," What are you doing?"
"3247140","3248600"," Some weak ass bulls."
"3250340","3251560"," Here come the sellers."
"3252160","3252880"," Look at that. "
"3253140","3254420"," You guys are looking at this stuff."
"3255240","3257640"," Let me take a walk around the market with you."
"3258700","3259600"," Let's look at the VIX. "
"3263520","3265260"," I thought you guys were watching this stuff."
"3265520","3267200"," This is the chart from this morning."
"3269480","3270580"," Look at a one hour chart. "
"3270740","3273020"," We almost had a perfect pen strike down below here in the VIX."
"3273900","3275100"," You guys want to see it?"
"3277040","3280100"," I want you to see what the bears and the bulls want."
"3280100","3280820"," This is hilarious. "
"3280820","3281880"," I already went through all this."
"3282440","3284120"," You see this blue line coming down."
"3285640","3288080"," Market bears want to see this hold. "
"3289860","3293100"," They want to come up to where this red box is right here."
"3294200","3295280"," They don't want to lose this."
"3295400","3296140"," They want to come above it. "
"3297400","3300260"," Then make a way up here in continuation."
"3300640","3302000"," This is what a market bear wants to see."
"3302220","3302960"," Something just like that. "
"3303660","3305100"," Maintaining this upward trend."
"3306040","3308840"," This is what a bear wants to see."
"3310100","3313360"," A bull wants to see this right here. "
"3313420","3314680"," You see sellers above here."
"3316900","3318920"," See how the buyers here?"
"3319260","3320340"," The sellers said, fuck no."
"3320520","3321460"," We're throwing this back down. "
"3321640","3324940"," So what the bulls want to see is a rejection here."
"3325640","3328780"," Or even a rejection here in continuation down."
"3331780","3332940"," We're going to go look at. "
"3333200","3335520"," I thought you guys were able to see all this stuff, but you weren't."
"3335840","3336720"," Same thing here."
"3336960","3342040"," I want to show you the perfect pen strike from we had these already charted out. "
"3342260","3345560"," You can see almost the perfect pen strike here on J and K."
"3346280","3348940"," This is telling a different story than what VIX is telling us."
"3350180","3351360"," You can see right here."
"3351620","3352820"," We had a almost perfect pen strike. "
"3353140","3355600"," Bulls want to maintain upward movement, right?"
"3356360","3356600"," I'm down."
"3357820","3358200"," Bam."
"3358900","3359380"," Move up higher. "
"3360160","3360920"," J and K is telling us."
"3361120","3363820"," Still somewhat telling a different story than VIX."
"3365400","3365800"," HYG. "
"3365980","3366840"," We'll take a look at that now."
"3368240","3369220"," These are all pre..."
"3369220","3370320"," We've already charted these out."
"3370440","3370840"," You can..."
"3370840","3371800"," Well, almost the perfect pen strike. "
"3371980","3372180"," Not quite."
"3373120","3374140"," This one's not as good."
"3375220","3378220"," The bulls are trying to hang on here for that same kind of continuation up. "
"3380960","3381800"," And see that."
"3382020","3382420"," This is..."
"3382420","3383660"," So bonds is still there."
"3383940","3384120"," Bullish. "
"3384320","3384680"," Excuse me."
"3386100","3388680"," We have some targets above if bulls are able to hold on."
"3389800","3390940"," Do we not do HYG?"
"3392100","3393300"," I think we did junk bonds. "
"3395560","3396560"," Nope, we just did it."
"3396680","3398160"," I think we just did junk bonds."
"3398620","3400900"," Yeah, we did junk bonds this morning, but not HYG. "
"3401060","3401380"," We should have."
"3401960","3402840"," They'll correspond."
"3403800","3404480"," They'll correspond. "
"3406640","3407500"," So there's VIX."
"3408080","3408620"," Bond market's same."
"3408760","3409400"," We're going back up. "
"3409720","3411080"," VIX is saying, fuck no."
"3411860","3413960"," We get some volatility into two o'clock this afternoon."
"3416480","3417420"," And the spy. "
"3418340","3419600"," Let's see how that's looking back."
"3419860","3420640"," Let's see how that's looking."
"3421080","3423280"," Let's see how that's looking. "
"3423280","3427840"," So VIX is telling you in the short term, expect some volatility into the event."
"3428240","3430060"," Bond market's saying, fuck no, we're going up."
"3432640","3436940"," So if we're going to get some volatility, maybe it's a quick rip down and then a quick rip higher"
"3436940","3438260"," into the event. "
"3438660","3445760"," That could be wrong on this, but there are some signs pointing towards a move like this in the"
"3445760","3452040"," underlying in the engine compartment of the market, I guess, under the hood stuff."
"3454180","3455780"," We'll take a look at Tesla again."
"3456780","3457520"," Tesla's recovering. "
"3463150","3468270"," Tesla has now had at least two checks, right?"
"3468530","3468830"," Check once."
"3470150","3470430"," Check again."
"3471470","3474230"," Now sitting on top of the gap. "
"3474450","3475650"," I think this is the gap fulfill."
"3476670","3479950"," But Tesla wants to try to regain this and hit that 50% if they can."
"3481010","3482970"," Tesla's looking bullish right now. "
"3482970","3484110"," Looking bullish."
"3484850","3493590"," If it rolls over and below the gap, expect that volatility to drag into the two o'clock hour."
"3493750","3503850"," If you're bearish on Tesla here, your price target below is going to be into the event 173.91. Hope"
"3503850","3504250"," that helps. "
"3505690","3508010"," When you guys trade, you should be doing this stuff on your own."
"3508870","3513150"," You should be, you know, you can look at the sec individual sectors as well, but you when if you're"
"3513150","3513870"," just trading the spy."
"3516590","3517110"," Don't worry. "
"3517330","3519630"," Earlier I was talking about reversing Tesla."
"3520210","3520930"," We'll go over that."
"3521010","3521390"," I promise. "
"3521550","3523970"," Whoever was asking of that earlier, we had a big market event here."
"3524050","3525150"," So we'll go back to Tesla."
"3525150","3527070"," How do you how do you see a reversal in Tesla?"
"3528910","3537990"," In the longer timeframe, and I'll show you that at some point. "
"3541670","3544650"," Remember that real support is much lower."
"3545370","3547910"," Remember we talked earlier about where real support is."
"3548190","3549090"," We're right down here. "
"3552940","3553460"," 396."
"3555360","3559320"," I'd be buying 397s again if you want some puts into the event."
"3560700","3561720"," 397 is a good place. "
"3562400","3563460"," They were a little expensive though."
"3564280","3567300"," They're 24 cents and they're still they're holding their value."
"3567300","3568860"," Like these three 98s, they want me to. "
"3569180","3570840"," They were like 32 cents for a minute."
"3570900","3571820"," I'm not fucking paying that."
"3572080","3572440"," Sorry. "
"3573580","3575180"," I'm not paying 32 cents."
"3575320","3576420"," I'm not paying 38 cents."
"3576760","3577900"," I want to pay like 10 cents. "
"3588040","3589740"," People are going to start selling their portfolios."
"3590280","3594060"," If we go below 2050 on VIX, I agree with that statement."
"3595480","3596900"," Uh, winky. "
"3597120","3597580"," I agree with that."
"3597840","3598460"," Are you shorting spy?"
"3598680","3601400"," If it drops that lower line, you're just going to let go for now."
"3601400","3602880"," That's a hell of a head and shoulders. "
"3603660","3608840"," Um, if you're not going to hit 37 sold half, hold 50 as long shot."
"3608940","3610140"," Good job, Kegus."
"3613830","3620970"," Uh, so the price target today, so the price target with, so the, the support resistance levels on"
"3620970","3621570"," Tesla. "
"3622990","3626270"," Um, for today was, we already hit it."
"3627150","3627590"," So."
"3630190","3633570"," These are the support resistance levels for Tesla, right?"
"3634270","3635750"," This is the pivot point right here. "
"3636450","3639010"," For Tesla for today, we went above the point."
"3639150","3641310"," This tells you that we were positive."
"3641570","3642090"," Remember yesterday?"
"3642710","3643430"," Remember yesterday?"
"3644170","3647550"," I was like before the open, I was like, oh, we're getting up to the pivot. "
"3648350","3650010"," And then we slipped under it, right?"
"3651270","3653230"," And I was like, this isn't a good look in here."
"3653650","3655970"," We need to break above this yellow line right here."
"3655970","3659070"," We did into the close, right?"
"3659310","3660830"," And we got above today's pivot point. "
"3661630","3665350"," Uh, so whatever time this was this morning and our three was right here."
"3665950","3669930"," So anything above this was free money."
"3670070","3671350"," This was an extension move up. "
"3672990","3677270"," Now, we're still ultimately bearish on Tesla right now."
"3678010","3682570"," What you want to see is the 50% retracement minimum."
"3683490","3684830"," To resume a downward move. "
"3684830","3689230"," But typically we're seeing 50 and a slight, slight kick up to 61."
"3689910","3691690"," And then the continuation of the downward movement."
"3692130","3693230"," Typically, that's what we're seeing. "
"3695230","3698390"," Does that make sense?"
"3700010","3704410"," Uh, somewhere up here, you'd, you'd be getting bullish."
"3705850","3709050"," If this continues up, but I don't think you're going to see that yet."
"3710830","3712930"," I don't think Tesla's done going down. "
"3713870","3715870"," So that's the move right there."
"3716890","3722330"," If you're a bear on Tesla, you're looking to short way up here."
"3725720","3726780"," That's where you're looking to short. "
"3728320","3729920"," That's where the real short is in Tesla."
"3731040","3732840"," You like you want that like real short?"
"3733220","3733720"," That's where it's at."
"3738480","3741760"," The one where you're like confidence in your trade for like a month. "
"3742320","3743340"," That's the, that's the trade."
"3746180","3748960"," Like short with confidence, longing with confidence."
"3765660","3766880"," What's the price target up?"
"3767040","3767440"," We already hit it. "
"3768000","3769620"," Or the weekly implied move on Tesla."
"3770420","3771740"," Uh, I can look."
"3771900","3773760"," You want to know what the weekly implied move on Tesla is?"
"3773820","3774280"," I can tell you. "
"3779520","3780260"," Let me just second."
"3780420","3780740"," I'll look it up."
"3786580","3790200"," It would have been better to have looked at it on the open this morning. "
"3791540","3795380"," But right where we are currently, I can tell you what the implied move from here on out is."
"3797600","3800220"," I'm going to tell you exactly what it is exactly where you are right now."
"3802900","3804000"," You want some time frames?"
"3805000","3810700"," Uh, December 2nd. "
"3812280","3820940"," Bull implied move, 190.66. Uh, 167.80. Also, I'll read those after you again."
"3821940","3823020"," The implied move on Tesla."
"3823840","3833160"," To December 2nd is $190.66. $167.80. Uh, for December"
"3833160","3833960"," 9th. "
"3834640","3844420"," Implied move is 194.16 and 163.39. For December 16th, implied move is"
"3844420","3854130"," 197.86 and 159.82. Now you want the percentage"
"3854130","3854490"," wise?"
"3855190","3860110"," Uh, there's an implied move of 6.4% on Tesla for today right now at this moment."
"3861150","3865930"," 8.6% move on the 9th."
"3867170","3870450"," And then a 10.6% move by the 16th. "
"3872410","3873050"," There you go."
"3873150","3873810"," There's your numbers for Tesla."
"3884300","3885100"," Thanks, Kegus. "

"3966700","3968100"," Stay away from those people out there on the internet."

"4051820","4053400"," You can check even in the guy captain's alpha. "
"4054020","4057480"," Uh, you've got, you've got people in there that sell that information."
"4058140","4059720"," I know I've got people in that selling information."
"4059820","4061660"," You can just, you can look at it publicly. "
"4062620","4069460"," So, uh, support your content makers that, that aren't trying to, uh, uh, scam on you because there"
"4069460","4074920"," are people out there that try to get this information and then repackage it and sell it for, for"
"4074920","4075300"," big money."
"4075820","4082420"," We were, I was having a conversation last night with, uh, with, um, who was his name with, uh, had"
"4082420","4083780"," a bunch of calls last night."
"4084500","4090460"," Uh, no, we were talking about it and I was like, you know, like you always notice, you'll always"
"4090460","4098200"," notice like low follow accounts, like that 10,000, 5,000, 500 followers, 3,000 followers, uh, 20 "
"4098200","4098960",",000 followers. "
"4099319","4103899"," The reason why they don't get, uh, 100,000 followers, 200,000 followers is because they're being"
"4103899","4106960"," farmed, uh, by scam sellers out there."
"4108240","4112760"," And, uh, so what you'll never see is you'll never see a scam seller pump those accounts."
"4113859","4115060"," They'll be like that. "
"4116100","4120580"," So what they'll do is they, they, they, they pump each other up to six scam sellers, right?"
"4120580","4124899"," So they get, uh, tons of followers, but they'll never tell their followers, like, if I've got a"
"4124899","4128899"," hundred thousand followers, 200,000 followers, 500,000 followers, a million followers, and then"
"4128899","4133620"," we're going to tell you, hey, you should follow, uh, Janae Marcus here because then Janae Marcus"
"4133620","4137920"," have, you know, be competing with that scam seller for real true alpha."
"4137920","4140180"," Like Janae Marcus has got real true alpha out there."
"4140399","4144960"," Him and his whole crew and that he runs around with have real true, like, to the, to the, to"
"4144960","4147960"," the, to the, to the Ping, uh, alpha, right?"
"4148479","4153479"," Um, so they'll never tell you as the scam buyer to follow those guys. "
"4153660","4155979"," Cause then you don't have to pay somebody 600 bucks for the scams."
"4156200","4156660"," Does that make sense?"
"4157460","4161859"," You should support those guys that are the true part of, there's a real part of Fintuit."
"4162020","4166040"," There's a, so not a select, but there's like a large portion of, shouldn't say they're select. "
"4166340","4169380"," There's a, there's a large portion of real content makers."
"4169939","4174840"," Uh, you know, Baba Yaga, that guy is always putting out dank, um, dank content."
"4175020","4175840"," He's got a thousand followers. "
"4175840","4176960"," That's just not right."
"4177319","4178040"," Uh, Winky."
"4178380","4179319"," It's got 300 followers. "
"4179600","4179960"," That's bullshit."
"4180580","4182000"," There are all kinds of guys out there."
"4182060","4184260"," Sator OG Wall Street better. "
"4184640","4185160"," What has he got?"
"4185240","4186180"," A thousand fucking followers."
"4186960","4192880"," I mean, you're talking about people with like 20, 30,000 in less followers that are all know what's"
"4192880","4193560"," up in this market."
"4194220","4196780"," Um, you got volatility whiz out there. "
"4196860","4202940"," I could, the list of names goes on and on and on and on of great, uh, great content makers."
"4203700","4207500"," And they get farmed by, uh, these big fucking scammers."
"4208300","4211000"," It shouldn't be, it shouldn't be going on this rant right now, but I am. "
"4214860","4215740"," I am."
"4218460","4219260"," Oh, hell no."
"4219480","4225320"," If you pay attention to jedi Marcus, his posts, if you follow jedi Marcus with his alerts and you"
"4225320","4226180"," just follow him. "
"4226820","4227480"," Closely, right?"
"4227940","4232060"," He interweaves through all of his posts where the market's heading."
"4232740","4236680"," He is like gangster on, on, uh, pin strikes."
"4237040","4241300"," He's gangster on, uh, technicals gangster. "
"4242160","4243800"," He's a, he's a must follow."
"4245600","4247400"," Must old school market maker too."
"4249060","4254820"," I think is, I think is, uh, I'm not, don't hold me to this, but I think is, uh, I"
"4254820","4257960"," think is, uh, what's it called?"
"4258260","4262820"," The tag that they used to wear, the, um, pit, pit guys just where I think it was, uh, JM"
"4262820","4263240"," 77. "
"4264120","4266620"," I think if you try to search him, see him out."
"4266920","4268580"," I probably shouldn't have said that."
"4269320","4272440"," I'm probably going to delete this video now, but I have it. "
"4272580","4277340"," I think I can't confirm that, but I think that he was a,"
"4277340","4303600"," uh, that's,"
"4303640","4309660"," that's another guy, short seller ST. So short seller ST had like zero followers, follows."
"4310160","4311420"," If you look now though, right?"
"4311660","4315540"," So he's got like low follower accounts, but guess who follows them?"
"4315640","4317400"," Like Angie Constantine follows them."
"4317980","4322640"," These people that use, see people out there that follow these guys that have low follower accounts. "
"4323380","4324860"," Like at short seller ST is a banger."
"4325200","4327660"," He had like 500 followers, like two weeks ago."
"4328140","4329060"," Uh, who's the other guy?"
"4329200","4330580"," Paz or Pax or whatever?"
"4331260","4333660"," He's like the green lizard guy, Paz or something. "
"4334980","4335760"," He's always crying."
"4336100","4340580"," I think he's a big on stock twits of all places, but he's a fucking great fucking trader."
"4341120","4342900"," Guy drops fucking science all day long. "
"4343900","4344840"," I forget his name."

"4385540","4386460"," Is that who it was?"
"4386700","4387860"," I don't think it's Pax trader."
"4388700","4389960"," He's got like three letters in his name. "

"5000440","5002200"," I think I followed him or I do follow him."
"5002320","5007020"," Maybe I don't have his XP X zero date. "
"5012840","5014220"," I think I follow him."
"5014300","5016500"," I think I have to go back and put alerts for him."
"5017220","5019020"," Because people don't show up my feed sometimes. "
"5019620","5022340"," Good job by Matthew Ryan for your puts."
"5023960","5024640"," A chance."

"5033300","5034340"," So I'll show you here."
"5034500","5036700"," I'm going to be looking for two things, right?"
"5037140","5039500"," Shorts to cover at some point just before the event. "
"5041060","5044180"," So you'll see like a you'll see like a short covering pre events."
"5044380","5049340"," Then you'll probably see a short a swing high and then a resumption over here."
"5054500","5055840"," Jill have a wonderful Thanksgiving. "
"5056300","5057900"," Make sure you follow Jill on Twitter."

"5078700","5081140"," See if he can get some rejection and take this next level out. "
"5081360","5081560"," We'll see."
"5084780","5089520"," We'll go back to book map so you can see the green balls coming in."
"5093400","5095520"," Check to see if that hammer candle is legit. "

"5165040","5167500"," So last trade we gave was buy some puts up here."
"5169160","5171460"," You guys want to discuss what time is right now. "
"5172400","5174300"," Okay, so it's one one oh four in the afternoon."
"5174400","5175360"," We've got an hour until."
"5176780","5177840"," The minutes drop. "
"5183710","5186590"," Let me know in the chat how you're going to play the minutes."
"5186590","5189090"," If you're going to let me know if you're going to be flat into the minutes."
"5189850","5192510"," If you're going to straddle or strangle. "
"5195250","5197390"," And sell the swing high swing low."
"5197990","5200670"," Let me know if you're going to just be inputs."
"5201810","5202850"," Just in calls. "
"5205390","5206990"," Let's take a look at a if you're just joining us."
"5207110","5208970"," We're going to take a look at a larger time frame."
"5209510","5210790"," The one month time frame. "
"5219560","5220920"," What would I like to see today?"
"5221320","5222240"," Do you want to know what I think?"
"5223760","5227880"," I'd like to see us at least test this bottom down here at three ninety five twenty nine."
"5229240","5230440"," Love to see that."
"5231340","5232600"," And a continuation higher. "
"5235560","5236600"," We sell it."
"5237300","5239460"," Come back on Friday and Monday and push it up."
"5240400","5241300"," That's what I would like to see. "
"5242880","5243660"," That's my preferred."
"5243660","5245780"," I really don't want to see like a."
"5246160","5248260"," I don't really want to trade."
"5249180","5252400"," As a bullet I don't want to be trading this this move higher. "
"5254240","5259530"," I'd really like to see this like trade down."
"5262250","5265170"," And then up melt up into the 15th of December."
"5266170","5268670"," I think that's what Larry's take was as well. "
"5269030","5273850"," Larry Williams take was some weakness into the first and then a continuation up."
"5274870","5278670"," We could also do this move down and then this move down to the beginning of the week."
"5279670","5281970"," And this is where the by the fucking dip is. "
"5282570","5283990"," This would be my favorite move."
"5284530","5285970"," If I had a if I had a choice."
"5287210","5290190"," I would really like to pick this up around the first of the year. "
"5291170","5292050"," Something like this."
"5294550","5295670"," That's really what I want."
"5297250","5298710"," Because I feel safer here. "
"5299550","5302030"," And then the 15th starts telling it."
"5302570","5304130"," Your tax loss harvest and shit."
"5308670","5309970"," Into the meeting though. "
"5313370","5318370"," My implied move is going to be a low of 3500 on the initial move."
"5320090","5321710"," And a high of four."
"5323510","5325950"," Call it a 404 19. "
"5326750","5329310"," So for me I think we trade to."
"5330090","5334070"," Between 401 and 404 right with this right with this area is right here."
"5334630","5336830"," I'm going to expect that we trade here at some point. "
"5339050","5341030"," And probably right in here."
"5343090","5344050"," That's where I think we trade."
"5344610","5345750"," I know that looks fucking messy. "
"5347090","5348570"," But I can show it in a better chart."
"5359960","5360600"," Right here."
"5361140","5362280"," This is where I think we trade to. "
"5363040","5363940"," On the initial move."
"5364820","5367800"," Probably just shy of three ninety six sixty four."
"5367900","5368960"," You don't quite touch it. "
"5369320","5370500"," We somewhere down there."
"5371700","5372720"," That's going to be somewhere."
"5376160","5377380"," Somewhere up here probably. "
"5378140","5380040"," I don't know if we'll get past the yellow but."
"5386580","5389060"," And the money calls and puts are nice trade."
"5391060","5391880"," Into the minutes. "
"5394640","5396700"," Like I like buying both sides."
"5405140","5406160"," You're going to be flat."
"5407220","5408760"," Yeah, this is a nice trade out. "
"5408880","5410240"," This is all great trading in here."
"5410340","5410740"," This is outstanding."
"5413000","5417320"," I will probably be flat into this event and look to react. "
"5417740","5418500"," That's the safest."
"5419000","5420800"," The safest way to trade is to."
"5422420","5424120"," The trading event is to. "
"5425680","5427580"," Be aware of where the levels are."
"5428800","5429720"," Let's say we dumped."
"5431500","5432320"," Down in here. "
"5432920","5434700"," To not not trade this part."
"5435200","5437000"," But to try to trade a relief."
"5439080","5439960"," Bounce or. "
"5441740","5443040"," If we bounce down here."
"5443220","5445620"," Wait for it to come back up and then take the next short lower."
"5445920","5446980"," What the news is. "
"5448320","5449580"," The same thing on the way up."
"5451320","5453180"," Not always if we sell the market."
"5453340","5455040"," I do want you to be aware if we do sell the market. "
"5455040","5456960"," It'll sell typically into the bell."
"5458120","5462260"," If we don't sell the market and the market goes up, you'll typically see us."
"5463280","5465620"," Go up into the bell, but then it'll sell off. "
"5467020","5468880"," Tomorrow or Friday or whatever."
"5469080","5470820"," So be be careful of the."
"5471560","5472520"," Overall bullishness. "
"5473000","5476700"," If we're bearish into the bell, if the bearishness should continue."
"5477160","5478700"," Into at least Friday."
"5479580","5480940"," If not even Monday. "
"5482640","5484000"," So continuation is on."
"5484640","5489280"," In my view before going to the event that the continuation of the bears are in charge."
"5490360","5491160"," They'll be continuation. "
"5491340","5494300"," If the bulls are in charge, I don't see there being continuation."
"5496360","5497800"," So I'd wrap it up by the end of the day."
"5504660","5505560"," What are you guys saying?"
"5505660","5508280"," Ivy seems low to me about some 403 C at 22 cents. "
"5508440","5509180"," That's dirt cheap."
"5509420","5509740"," I like it."
"5512340","5515260"," Can I talk about how to have a book map for free book maps expensive. "
"5515800","5516900"," If you go there."
"5517420","5521280"," There are way more tools and information and data on the actual book map site."
"5521280","5522240"," It's very expensive though. "
"5522360","5524900"," It can cost you upwards of four, five, six hundred dollars."
"5525360","5526140"," I don't want you buying."
"5527880","5530740"," If you do the free version, you can sign up for thicker swim. "
"5532460","5534020"," And download the desktop app."
"5534200","5534840"," I think you have to."
"5536080","5539860"," And you go to support or chat and. "
"5543480","5547600"," You can go to support or chat and request to demo."
"5548240","5552260"," You're considering using book map and they'll give you a free trial."
"5554060","5558340"," But it's not you can pay for their data to there, but their data still isn't the best packages. "
"5558340","5560220"," The best data you can get is from."
"5561060","5565550"," Is from book map."
"5570200","5571640"," Textbook sells right here. "
"5576060","5579400"," If you are short right now, currently are shorting this."
"5579900","5583940"," If you're if you're a bear shorting this, just be conscious right around."
"5585200","5586120"," Let me see. "
"5588560","5590300"," It's one 11 in the afternoon."
"5590300","5591600"," If you are shorting."
"5592940","5593580"," Here. "
"5595980","5597920"," Right around a half an hour before."
"5599320","5600600"," I'd be wrapping that shit up."
"5602360","5605640"," Because at some point the shorts will usually cover at some point. "
"5605960","5608560"," Not always, but just be conscious of it right in here 130."
"5613570","5615830"," Let's see what you guys are texting or chatting."
"5617710","5619070"," I'll trade the action at the event. "
"5619310","5620910"," Yeah, I'm not going to trade the event."
"5621070","5621810"," I'm going to wait until after."
"5623830","5626470"," If you guys are going to wait for that for the event. "
"5627670","5630490"," Another cool tool you should have in your toolbox is."
"5631750","5635430"," Setting up two or three instances of your favorite brokerage."
"5638350","5642470"," Have calls and puts pre selected with like a hundred rack. "
"5645090","5647950"," I shouldn't tell you guys this is terrible, not financial advice."
"5651310","5656070"," You guys can set up, you know, like a trade for a hundred puts or a hundred calls."
"5656990","5661630"," Then you watch the action and you're ready to go to buy the dip or a rip. "
"5665030","5667290"," Can you tell me how to have a book map for free?"
"5667510","5668010"," Talk about that."
"5669430","5671030"," I already know what they want to do."
"5671290","5671770"," Plus there's other. "
"5673370","5673910"," That's right."
"5674210","5674790"," Jill's got it right."
"5675410","5675690"," Don't predict. "
"5675690","5678150"," And you have to know your levels."
"5678670","5681710"," And on events typically they won't tag the level perfectly."
"5682170","5683690"," They'll just shy of it. "
"5684430","5686110"," Always better to buy in the money calls."
"5686370","5688410"," If you're buying, buying the money calls and puts."
"5689710","5692650"," The father, the OTM stuff tends not to print. "
"5693550","5694550"," And they'll trap your ass."
"5695610","5696090"," I promise."
"5697730","5699030"," Strong fireworks under 400. "
"5699550","5702070"," Captain, what if you're a melancholy, if we're a melancholy into the bell?"
"5703670","5704570"," I doubt that."
"5704570","5709610"," If you're a VIX bull, I would be selling VIX after the event or near the event."
"5712540","5713400"," I think the minutes. "
"5713880","5714440"," What are you guys saying?"
"5715540","5717400"," I'm going through what you guys are saying in the chat."
"5717980","5720240"," I think the minutes will trigger a huge move into cash hours."
"5720880","5721600"," When you get some time. "
"5723220","5726280"," Could you discuss, treasure buying, put spreads off the next big bounce up."
"5727060","5728360"," Pretty much out how wide I've spread before."
"5728820","5729940"," Yeah, we can talk about that right now. "
"5729940","5733160"," Checks, yes, have thinkorswim, click support, right?"
"5733500","5735320"," Then closing reopen."
"5735840","5737440"," Yeah, you have to reset your thing, right?"
"5737780","5738620"," I forgot about that part."
"5739300","5742620"," I thought that this morning, how come 30 seconds after the minutes are out?"
"5743180","5745140"," And two posts, Paris, they have them in advance. "
"5748000","5751860"," Do they have them in advance?"
"5753260","5759800"," No, so there's companies like, there are companies that when they're released."
"5762700","5768560"," When they're released, they will have like 10, 20 guys reading that stuff immediately, especially"
"5768560","5770400"," the big squawk services."
"5771080","5771900"," We'll do that. "
"5775560","5776650"," I'm a Canadian moron."
"5779260","5779980"," That's hilarious."
"5783960","5785320"," I'm a Canadian. "
"5786120","5787560"," I thought Canadians were always nice."
"5788900","5792340"," I guess by saying moron, it's better than what an American would say."
"5792800","5794180"," Be in safe fuck head or whatever. "
"5798480","5799900"," Grab the cocaine, baby."
"5804810","5807250"," When you set a stop, never, never market orders."
"5807570","5808810"," Yeah, I mean, oh, I shouldn't say never. "
"5809050","5810590"," I don't ever do market orders."
"5812130","5816630"," There's a big, you know, as people will say, don't ever set any limits because they'll tag them on"
"5816630","5816790"," you."
"5818710","5823670"," I manually, I manually manage my limit orders. "
"5824870","5826090"," Sometimes they won't fail."
"5826570","5829770"," If you get like a big red bar down, they won't fail and your market will fail."
"5832070","5833850"," So, but I don't like market orders. "
"5833990","5836170"," I've gotten fucked on market orders many times when I was younger."
"5836670","5839370"," Many times didn't realize what market orders were."
"5839950","5842810"," Surely expecting the data from the federal reverse repopration. "
"5846370","5847430"," What do we got here?"
"5847950","5848770"," We got some porn girls."
"5854210","5856130"," Hello, enjoy work tomorrow, Canadians."
"5857850","5858410"," Hot girls. "
"5858670","5863010"," According to people familiar with the matter, EU talks are still overpriced for Russian oil price"
"5863010","5863250"," cap."
"5863790","5866810"," And EU negotiations continue over the Russia price cap level."
"5867390","5869050"," Looks like some shorts are covering right now. "
"5870090","5871430"," I'm checking book map right now."
"5874490","5875830"," You're going to see a move here."
"5889580","5893040"," Give you guys some bigger perspective so we can watch the move as it takes place. "
"5894340","5897160"," Remember, as we head into 130, you will see some short covering usually."
"5901040","5903100"," It is 116, 14 minutes left."
"5905120","5907080"," Probably see some short covering coming up here. "
"5908720","5913350"," I love you guys."
"5913530","5914450"," I love all you guys out there."
"5914650","5917550"," I want you guys to know this wouldn't be happening if it wasn't for you guys. "
"5923080","5941180"," Yes, we had a 15 year fixed rate mortgage average 5.9% 30 year at 6.58%. We"
"5941180","5942220"," walked around the market."
"5942380","5945080"," We took a look at junk bonds with our J&K."
"5945280","5951220"," We took a look at HYG high yield growth to look at VIX already talked about the entire market. "
"5951220","5952520"," We looked at a macro for the market."
"5952520","5957780"," We talked about where expected moves are going to be on the spy."
"5959300","5960700"," You guys should be ready to go. "
"5960860","5961400"," We're at this point."
"5961960","5965800"," You have all the data that you need to trade the event."
"5967920","5968800"," So we should be good. "
"5972020","5974400"," You guys should all be ready to go for this event at this point."
"5984670","5985510"," Yeah, you know, it's crazy."
"5985890","5988030"," Too winky is the payment. "
"5988490","5989390"," You know, it was not just crazy."
"5990890","5992190"," Not just the payment."
"5992490","5995690"," The amount the payment has gone up to, but the fucking taxes, man. "
"5995690","5999330"," I was just talking to some friends and they, um, they're buying."
"5999830","6005650"," So where I'm buying in a place that's becoming gentrified and what they're doing is."
"6009960","6011560"," What they're doing is crazy. "
"6012040","6013840"," So the county, what they're doing is."
"6014780","6019020"," So you can't buy like a rehab home in Detroit."
"6019020","6020420"," You have to buy like a shithole. "
"6021200","6022520"," It has low taxes."
"6023940","6026380"," And the moment that neighborhood becomes gentrified."
"6029060","6033360"," You're talking about paying like thirteen, thirteen hundred bucks a year. "
"6034040","6035780"," Fifteen hundred bucks a year and like a."
"6037000","6038360"," Couple thousand square foot home."
"6040720","6044860"," And some of these neighborhoods that are have been like fully rehab, neighborhood that gets fully"
"6044860","6046600"," rehab, they're going to resell them."
"6047460","6050840"," And the new buyers are paying like seven, eight hundred dollars a month in taxes. "
"6051780","6052800"," That's fucking insane."
"6053200","6057960"," And this happened across the U.S. So it's not just like the inflation and the housing prices, but"
"6057960","6059940"," the taxation."
"6060540","6066540"," You guys, if you guys know about debt cycles, we'll know that you'll see the government start tax. "
"6069600","6072060"," There's like a, there's a part to the cycle where you see like taxation."
"6072600","6075380"," Then you see protesting by the people."
"6076740","6079660"," There's like a, in the, in the, in the debt cycle. "
"6079740","6082780"," And then you'll see a war typically, some kind of war."
"6084260","6087280"," Some, there's another part of it's a long term debt cycle."
"6087400","6090940"," They'll say it's civil war, but usually it's a war between countries. "
"6092380","6096140"," And note that those are littered throughout where, where are we in the debt cycle?"
"6098400","6100040"," Lots of short covering right now."
"6112390","6114710"," And we'll extend, we'll make this a box now."
"6129940","6136120"," And as we come into the minutes release, what I'll do is make sure we can watch all the move. "
"6137760","6138240"," Together."
"6139820","6140720"," There we go."
"6141300","6142900"," You guys can see the entire move. "
"6145280","6146880"," You see where our one is."
"6151240","6151960"," Pivot point."
"6152720","6153360"," Here's S one. "
"6158110","6160470"," Train right where we opened almost right."
"6166150","6168370"," How about this in the chat?"
"6169930","6174370"," You guys tell me what you think's going to happen into the close after the initial moves."
"6175690","6179830"," Because I'm going to tell you that you tell me the child you think what I think is this. "
"6180130","6183090"," I think that the meeting was davish."
"6185230","6188270"," And I think the initial reaction is going to be not moved."
"6190410","6195030"," I think that because J pow when it when he was interviewed during the meeting. "
"6195570","6197670"," He knew that it was perceived as davish."
"6197910","6201930"," So he had to come out, make everyone believe that the markets going to continue down."
"6203310","6205830"," So I think the minutes are going to be davish. "
"6206790","6208090"," Pause this davish."
"6208950","6210930"," I think it's going to impact the December meeting."
"6214490","6216910"," We have J pow coming out next week, right?"
"6216910","6217810"," Talked them out. "
"6217870","6218710"," Market down again."
"6219390","6222890"," I think the after the initial davishness though."
"6223430","6227550"," I don't know if it happens at the meeting in December, but I think you're going to see that"
"6227550","6229270"," eventual role of the market down. "
"6229770","6232230"," In the December 15th or 14th meeting."
"6233070","6236210"," I think if they actually do pause or lower rates."
"6237050","6241390"," Like they say, you guys have now heard it all over the news and Twitter and shit at this point. "
"6242870","6243930"," That's bad for the market."
"6244170","6245250"," Bad for the equity markets."
"6245250","6245910"," So they do that. "
"6247770","6250830"," The other implication is they've broken something if they do pause."
"6251790","6252630"," That we don't know about."
"6252870","6256430"," Maybe people claiming it's FTX, but it could be something we don't see publicly. "
"6258570","6262390"," If they continue with rates and that the pace of rates."
"6263610","6265330"," That would mean we haven't broken stuff."
"6267210","6269070"," And I think that that gives them. "
"6269210","6269890"," I think the market."
"6270250","6271410"," It gives the market."
"6271410","6275450"," A chance to have that bottoming process that we're in. "
"6275850","6278070"," I think you'd see that 350 320."
"6279090","6282950"," That 350 we hit before and then somewhere down around 320 in March."
"6283510","6285650"," And that's going to be some kind of a market bottom. "
"6285830","6288270"," We might trade higher into 2025."
"6289830","6291210"," Mark my words on that."
"6293790","6297890"," So this meant these minutes in the meeting in December are going to be critical. "
"6298970","6303170"," If the market can find their hammer on a bottom between now and March."
"6304650","6310310"," For a for to wait until the labor market specifically the labor market weekends."
"6312950","6317750"," I think the market would move up until the what labor market weekends weekends that could take us"
"6317750","6318510"," in a 2025. "
"6321970","6323970"," That's if they continue in the pace with rates."
"6323970","6328490"," I think if they do if they don't continue with the pace of rates though."
"6329170","6330530"," We're going to plant we're going to plunge. "
"6331530","6333570"," We're going to go to the we're going to do the Michael Bury."
"6339210","6342770"," You want to see it on a larger scale I can show you and time is the right now."
"6347870","6350610"," And another time not during this event I could show you. "
"6351250","6354310"," The two outlooks the worst part is though to right."
"6354310","6357030"," If you were to trade if you were to trade it higher in 2025."
"6357590","6360730"," It's going to be a fucking bloodbath once on point. "
"6360970","6363550"," That's my key right there right I agree with Larry on that."
"6364870","6367710"," You need to see blood in the streets on Main Street."
"6368090","6368950"," You need to see. "
"6371030","6376950"," Like Jim Bob losing his wife losing his house losing his job losing his dog losing everything."
"6377470","6381570"," You really need to see that for this market to really fucking burn."
"6382770","6386370"," And so you see that shit people are working people are paying them mortgages. "
"6386950","6388830"," They're not expanding as much."
"6388970","6393490"," They're not like you know buying new houses and stuff but we're not at that point right now."
"6394390","6397090"," The timing isn't right for the market to burn. "
"6397330","6399390"," So if that's the case and they're just going to keep laying it on."
"6399810","6404310"," There's no reason why we wouldn't hammer out a bottom and and trade trade this market up higher."
"6404830","6407090"," Until we're ready to to bloodbath this market. "
"6409330","6411490"," So it's going to be interesting to hear the talk in the minutes."
"6413510","6417130"," And the real nail in the coffin one way or the other is going to be that December meeting."
"6425830","6427030"," Yeah I can raise the volume up. "
"6427230","6428450"," You guys want to raise the volume up a little bit."
"6429290","6432590"," You guys right because I need a second to drink some water so I can get into the mode the"
"6432590","6433270"," streaming mode."
"6434130","6436310"," Of market commentary as we go up or down. "
"6439300","6441400"," We have a many minutes we got left."
"6443200","6443580"," It's 125."
"6450840","6452680"," So this is what I think is going to happen. "
"6453820","6455080"," I think we're going to."
"6455760","6457060"," Oh no I think we stay right here."
"6457780","6460320"," Because we're actually pretty we're pretty pretty much at the open. "
"6460560","6461800"," This is a pretty good place for us right."
"6462520","6463660"," I'll expect an initial."
"6465480","6465920"," Squeeze. "
"6466380","6467160"," Move down."
"6468120","6468820"," Move up."
"6469500","6470600"," Unless the news is bad. "
"6471780","6473160"," Something like that's what I'm looking for."
"6476560","6478460"," That's what that's my take."
"6479840","6480720"," You let me know. "
"6481880","6485240"," If it's like if we could happen if the news is bad."
"6485660","6486920"," It'd be something like this."
"6487640","6490280"," You get this and you get a failure here. "
"6490420","6491240"," If you see a failure here."
"6491900","6492760"," That's going to be horrible."
"6496740","6498360"," Watch it go the exact opposite way. "
"6498500","6499280"," Isn't that how it always works."
"6500300","6502000"," Just do the opposite of what I said."
"6503300","6505560"," Seriously do the opposite of what I just fucking. "
"6506560","6506980"," Crayon."
"6508080","6509260"," Do the opposite of that."
"6513740","6514720"," Fuck the yield. "
"6515540","6516060"," Sorry."
"6517580","6518100"," Zero."
"6519460","6519980"," Zero. "
"6521140","6521560"," Zero."
"6523540","6523620"," I."
"6526100","6528680"," I don't want to hear it."
"6528880","6531200"," Well you guys can you guys can follow the yield. "
"6531600","6532320"," The yield."
"6534580","6537360"," There's only one that I want to know and that is unemployment."
"6539500","6542260"," I don't mean like we laid off 10,000 workers. "
"6542640","6543020"," I'm old."
"6543340","6543620"," I know."
"6547720","6548680"," I'm an old guy. "
"6548960","6550280"," I know exactly what it looks like."
"6550360","6551940"," I've seen my dad's gone through it."
"6552360","6555500"," I lived in Vale when it happened last time in 2007. "
"6556780","6557820"," I've seen it happen."
"6557960","6559020"," I've had it happen in my family."
"6560460","6561920"," I know exactly what it looks like. "
"6562240","6563000"," You'll know it too."
"6565870","6567530"," If you're young or haven't been through."
"6568050","6569050"," A couple cycles. "
"6570450","6571490"," You're just looking for."
"6571770","6572630"," You're looking for."
"6572770","6575050"," You're looking for people not paying their bills in mass. "
"6576810","6577610"," You'll know it."
"6577750","6578070"," Trust me."
"6578730","6579830"," You will know it. "
"6581570","6582350"," That's the tell."
"6583130","6586210"," The problem right now is that people are paying their fucking bills."
"6587450","6588750"," You might not know that. "
"6589070","6591610"," I can assure you that companies know that."
"6591730","6596050"," I can assure you that big companies have no problems taking loans out."
"6596050","6598770"," At 10% interest, 15% interest. "
"6599250","6600170"," They don't fucking care."
"6601730","6603810"," I'm going to assure you behind closed doors."
"6605930","6607390"," There's expansion in companies. "
"6609330","6610550"," People are still working."
"6610770","6611950"," People are still demand."
"6612790","6615030"," People are still buying groceries, expensive groceries. "
"6616010","6618790"," People are still buying brand new trucks and brand new EV cars."
"6619590","6622410"," They're not at the rate that they once were, but they still are."
"6622410","6624210"," They're holding on to those items. "
"6624630","6626130"," They're not upside down yet at them."
"6627630","6630790"," They're F-150 that cost $140,000."
"6631410","6634230"," Hasn't reduced in value to $10,000 yet. "
"6635650","6636830"," You just haven't seen that stuff."
"6636970","6639130"," So even if the man is slightly down, you're not seeing blood in the street."
"6639310","6640950"," You need to see blood in the streets. "
"6641910","6642910"," It's horrible to say."
"6643510","6646370"," But people with bad debt, that's part of that debt cycle."
"6646590","6652030"," You want like body, Billy Bob, Mikey, Jim, Joe, Dave, Mike. "
"6652030","6656330"," Mary Sue, Jill, Martha, whoever."
"6657830","6662510"," You want to see people with bad debt get cleaned out of the system."
"6663590","6668430"," And that opens the door for free money to be giving away, giving away to those people. "
"6669290","6675550"," So young people, people that are old, they're like 40s, 50s, right in that age group, like 35 to 50"
"6675550","6676130"," years old."
"6676770","6679410"," Some people in their 60s that have bad debt and you don't know it."
"6679990","6683310"," Like you might look at your neighbor and be like, yeah, that guy's doing great. "
"6683570","6684490"," But that's weird too."
"6684870","6686770"," I talked to Joe Donut about this."
"6688390","6693290"," You'll see friends, you'll see some people drive an older car and they have money and they pay"
"6693290","6693870"," their debt down. "
"6693990","6694490"," They pay their bills."
"6695070","6695830"," They don't have any bad debt."
"6696370","6702470"," And I know that you know people in life that they're like, oh, I've got my job. "
"6702630","6703010"," I've got my retirement."
"6703570","6704290"," I've got a brand new truck."
"6704550","6705350"," My house is nice. "
"6705730","6706990"," My lawn is kept up."
"6706990","6708510"," But they're one step away."
"6708630","6710450"," If something were to go wrong, but they would lose. "
"6710850","6712030"," We got a bull flag here."
"6712450","6712990"," It's heads up."
"6713650","6714430"," They're one step away. "
"6715250","6716310"," They lose their job."
"6716710","6718010"," They get a medical emergency."
"6719290","6720330"," And they're starting to sell stuff. "
"6720650","6722890"," I don't know if you've ever had death in your family."
"6723270","6729330"," You find out that when your family members die, you end up having to sell their homes, pay their"
"6729330","6729790"," debt off."
"6729990","6731730"," Not always, but it happens, right?"
"6732270","6735190"," Get a little flag going on here. "
"6738010","6738750"," Here it is."
"6740530","6741370"," There's the covering."
"6743250","6745970"," There's the initial move covering move here. "
"6746510","6746950"," So."
"6748870","6751110"," So when they say they have to clear out the bad debt."
"6752430","6757710"," In society, they need to clear out people that it's not necessarily just bad debt. "
"6757870","6758470"," You could have good debt."
"6758650","6761370"," You think you have good debt, but you really don't."
"6762550","6763870"," Real wealth is different. "
"6766470","6767790"," And you need to get a clear."
"6767950","6769550"," That's part of our capitalistic system."
"6769670","6776270"," You need to clear out this bad debt so that we can get new debt into the system, right?"
"6776370","6782290"," You allow a young person to take on debt and try to make something for themselves in the future of"
"6782290","6782710"," this country. "
"6783270","6784250"," Same thing with companies."
"6785470","6790030"," You have, like, who's the people that do the fucking bike company?"
"6790570","6795170"," You have some companies that invest and they make a new product that's excellent."
"6795970","6798010"," And it doesn't matter where their stock price goes. "
"6798410","6798990"," They're going to succeed."
"6799230","6799890"," They're not going to go bankrupt."
"6801510","6803090"," They'll scrape by, right?"
"6804010","6808330"," But you need to weed out companies that squandered the free money that they got. "
"6808890","6814350"," Squant didn't make, like, I feel like the bike company is called fucking exercise bike company."
"6814730","6817770"," You know, they're making a wristwatch instead of making an outdoor bike."
"6818750","6822630"," They did the indoor bike for, sorry, I'm having a mind block on who they are. "
"6822710","6825070"," But during COVID, they were slamming, right?"
"6825210","6827730"," All these people wanted to ride an exercise bike inside their house."
"6828350","6832170"," And then you look over at them and you say, are you going to now make an outside bike when"
"6832170","6834450"," they reopen the US?"
"6834930","6835530"," And they didn't."
"6836030","6837710"," You know, so it's like you squandered that money. "
"6837890","6842070"," You're partying, jet set and snort and cocaine, drinking whores, all that stuff."
"6842750","6845170"," You know, you have to get rid of those companies out of the system."
"6847190","6850710"," So those companies probably can't take on 15% loans. "
"6850970","6853430"," The good companies can, but those companies won't be able to."
"6853970","6856270"," We don't see the effects of that yet."
"6856470","6859510"," You're not seeing, like, mass bankruptcies on shitty companies. "
"6860050","6863230"," There's still demand for these shitty companies, right?"
"6863450","6868330"," There's still demand for these shitty companies, and there's still people buying $100,000 trucks,"
"6868470","6871690"," or their $100,000 trucks still cost $100,000, right?"
"6871690","6876790"," So until you see that kind of stuff, when you start to see shitty companies declare bankruptcy,"
"6876790","6884790"," when you start to see blood on the streets in your neighborhood, just suburbia or whatever, people"
"6884790","6887850"," that you thought had good debt, that's when you start."
"6888130","6889350"," That's when you see it."
"6889590","6890490"," Like, I used to live in Vail. "
"6891470","6892790"," And when I lived in Vail, right?"
"6893630","6895070"," This is like the wildest thing."
"6895730","6896590"," People were in Vail."
"6896730","6897130"," We were partying. "
"6897830","6899130"," People were ordering Christal."
"6899290","6900230"," People were in Louis Trey."
"6900230","6903070"," People are, people are, money is no fucking object. "

"7750780","7751420"," We should leave this here."
"7752040","7756460"," Just be conscious of this as we head into their sellers hiding here. "
"7757100","7758160"," There's like some seller."
"7758320","7762300"," There's some, there's some cells that are right here waiting to sell this market above."
"7763340","7767040"," Depending on how the news is, this can disappear and we can trade higher. "
"7767960","7771900"," If the news is bad for the market, you can see this disappear."
"7773120","7774880"," But there are some buyers down here waiting."
"7775100","7775240"," Okay. "
"7775880","7777360"," There are standing by orders here."
"7780600","7782640"," And there are standing sellers here."
"7785280","7786400"," This help you guys out. "
"7786640","7787120"," Hope it does."
"7791120","7793320"," You guys have a preference on watching."
"7794280","7799120"," We are coming into some support right now on book map showing where the market is being supportive"
"7799120","7799940"," right where we are. "
"7800820","7802300"," So we'll go back and show that."
"7802620","7803920"," There's some buyers right here."
"7812270","7813590"," Buyers are stepping in. "
"7823110","7828650"," You guys prefer to watch book map or as we come into the news or do you guys prefer to"
"7828650","7832390"," watch the main screen here."
"7836580","7838120"," Let me know in the chat what you prefer."
"7849780","7851080"," Very eye opening right?"
"7854900","7856520"," Four threes are now forty cents. "
"7861100","7862580"," You guys prefer to watch book map."
"7862980","7863360"," We can do that."
"7866740","7868040"," You guys have all your levels. "
"7868420","7870660"," You guys got your levels from before the open this morning."
"7871540","7872900"," You guys should be ready to go."
"7873120","7875460"," There should be no reason why you guys are ready to go for this. "
"7876220","7881180"," If I enter a position, as we enter it's a one forty nine."
"7881300","7882100"," We got eleven minutes left."
"7882340","7883500"," I want you to know as we head into. "
"7885600","7888280"," As we head into, I'll put us back on book map here."
"7889240","7891380"," As we head into the two o'clock hour."
"7893720","7900020"," I do live stream my trades before they happen and then when I close them. "
"7903460","7906560"," If you want to follow along, not financial advice."
"7906740","7910600"," I don't ever recommend that you trade along with me though, but if you want to paper trade them or"
"7910600","7911480"," just follow along."
"7912860","7917240"," What I'll tell you is that you can go to the YouTube channel bottom right hand side. "
"7917780","7927000"," There's a gear icon and you can select that gear icon for playback speed."
"7927400","7931260"," Hit it two point zero and I'll sound like a clown or something."
"7931500","7936820"," I already sound like a clown normally, but my voice will change and the live stream. "
"7941660","7945160"," The live stream will catch up and be real time like three to five seconds."
"7945720","7948600"," YouTube has a delay naturally on their streaming."
"7949500","7952060"," If you want to speed it up so that you can trade along with me. "
"7964240","7972850"," We'll switch back and forth here so you can see what that looks like."
"7983160","7986040"," I'll show you that green box that I have on the regular channel."
"7986080","7987920"," I'll show you why I have that green box there. "
"7988080","8001310"," I'll point it out to"
"8001310","8001310"," you."
"8001310","8005270"," That's where that green box is right down here."
"8009060","8010320"," You guys want to look higher?"
"8025200","8026240"," Alright, there we go. "
"8034980","8036640"," That mean clown voice, right?"
"8038920","8040700"," Set yourselves up, be ready to trade."
"8044990","8046330"," Nine minutes until the release."
"8048170","8049590"," Wish I had some whiskey right now. "
"8050310","8051950"," Probably good that I'm sober right now."
"8053130","8057070"," So I can trade this with you guys and not make bad trades."
"8057630","8058470"," I'm always sweating. "
"8059050","8062410"," You're always on the spot when you're doing this live because people are like, look, he failed."
"8064850","8066370"," Everyone's always waiting for me to fail."
"8084430","8086310"," Yeah, when I'm not streaming, I post my trades. "
"8088710","8090710"," I live stream my trades here."
"8091410","8092650"," When I'm live streaming, I do them here."
"8094730","8096810"," Your wife's boyfriend says it's on the tape. "
"8104280","8106040"," I don't know what he's doing right now."
"8106160","8106960"," The stator is doing right now."
"8111910","8115450"," Thanks for posting that, Jose, that premium is rising right now. "
"8116690","8120930"," I got to switch over to my trading app here."
"8121310","8122590"," Let's take a look at calls right now."
"8124090","8124810"," Let me see. "
"8124810","8129470"," We've got fucking 214,000."
"8129970","8130970"," I don't like this."
"8133030","8138070"," It's 414,000 calls out at 67 cents on 402. "
"8140350","8141670"," I don't like that."
"8143250","8144950"," Everyone's expecting us to go up."
"8145650","8146670"," That's not good. "
"8149830","8152750"," They need to flush those calls down to nothing."
"8161780","8165080"," They need those 402s to be like 30 cents or 10 cents."
"8167340","8169160"," I'm going to burn all those calls, I think. "
"8174940","8176260"," I'm going to torch those calls."
"8184300","8185360"," What am I looking at?"
"8187080","8191040"," I'm looking at 398p, kind of expensive."
"8201820","8202980"," Nice trade around here. "
"8203059","8208100"," Sometimes buying just outside the money puts in calls, whatever which way we go."
"8209219","8212340"," Cash out one side, wait until we go the other way, and then cash out the other side."
"8215180","8216280"," Cash out both sides. "
"8216799","8218700"," You need balls of steel though to do that trade."
"8220080","8221740"," Some people have it, some people don't."
"8222520","8223020"," Some people panic. "
"8225820","8226760"," Five both sides."
"8232400","8234719"," Cat put premium today is still more than calls."
"8235180","8235740"," Yeah, those. "
"8240440","8243379"," We called out 398s when they were 10 cents, right?"
"8244160","8245400"," This morning when they were dirt cheap."
"8250590","8253290"," Also remember one last thing before we head into this event."
"8253370","8257350"," Remember, whichever way we go, whichever way you're positioned, right?"
"8257990","8261469"," The moment this event ball goes away, they're going to reprice options. "
"8262250","8263350"," So there's two trades."
"8264150","8265410"," There's the initial move."
"8266770","8269670"," When we make that move, close for profit. "
"8270670","8275629"," And then give a moment for the options market to be repriced before you pick them up again."
"8276209","8276750"," Does that make sense?"
"8279820","8281440"," So once the event ball is gone."
"8282980","8283940"," Oh, look at that. "
"8285500","8286420"," Look at that."
"8287580","8288660"," Look at book map."
"8289799","8293639"," To the right of book map, you see how all the information is disappearing. "
"8302440","8307160"," Just so be careful, the initial move, take profit, whichever way you're positioned."
"8308400","8311500"," And once you see that event ball go, you're going to see repricing of options."
"8315260","8316059"," Five minute warm. "
"8327330","8329209"," Here, note that you're seeing right now."
"8329490","8331709"," I want you to see this on the regular chart real quick."
"8332010","8332450"," There's the mainstream. "
"8333230","8336969"," I'm going to remove this green little box right here because of the information."
"8338070","8338510"," Look at it."
"8338549","8340850"," I'm just sitting here waiting for this event to take place. "
"8340950","8342370"," I'm going to remove the yellow line now."
"8348610","8353830"," So according to sources, the White House is considering using revenues of SPR crude oil cells to"
"8353830","8356570"," buy heating oil to help with supply crunch."
"8365469","8367150"," Look at that ghost town. "
"8369170","8370389"," Ghost town on book map."
"8370889","8372030"," You're going to see a huge move here."
"8372170","8372570"," It's going to be wild. "
"8373190","8375010"," Book map looks awesome when these moves are made."
"8376770","8377549"," It looks really cool."
"8400530","8402050"," Not all not every time, but. "
"8405610","8407250"," Sometimes in these events when when the."
"8407930","8409610"," Put calls side is lopsided."
"8422020","8423300"," What's junk bonds and. "
"8424580","8428580"," Who do junk bonds and hyz hyz or no."
"8429900","8431340"," They're flagging like a squeeze."
"8434640","8436800"," Dixie is now retesting the lows again. "
"8443220","8444680"," Vick's tough to say."
"8445200","8445880"," Same as earlier."
"8447160","8448200"," On some support. "
"8454480","8457660"," Huge gap underneath huge gap fill underneath hyz."
"8463590","8464810"," This doesn't always work."
"8464970","8465610"," Don't take this as. "
"8468050","8472010"," In stone, but sometimes when everyone's lopsided in that tray, they'll go the other way."
"8472590","8473490"," Clean it all out."
"8473750","8475050"," See everybody on the put side. "
"8476390","8477230"," Go long."
"8477230","8478430"," Everybody's on the call side."
"8478630","8478970"," Go short. "
"8479970","8480570"," These events."
"8482710","8483730"," Just a minute left here."
"8483830","8485630"," We go guys speed up your playbacks. "
"8486890","8488850"," Get up your real time with me."
"8489650","8491090"," Got my finger on puts right now."
"8491170","8491730"," I haven't bought them yet. "
"8497130","8499710"," Matter of fact, I'm going to set up calls to just in case here."
"8501170","8502330"," I'm going to set up 404s."
"8506990","8511170"," 404c and 398p on there. "
"8511410","8512350"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"8514090","8516950"," I had like 400 buys on puts."
"8517290","8518750"," No fucking way doing that shit. "
"8520710","8523350"," I'm not buying four fucking racks of puts."
"8524490","8524910"," Crazy."
"8526590","8532310"," I'm looking at 404c and 398p. "
"8533330","8537150"," I'm going to move in."
"8554050","8555770"," Whoa."
"8563800","8589500"," Buying the"
"8589500","8589900"," dip here. "
"8591020","8599470"," Bought 404c."
"8614900","8615640"," 404c."
"8626280","8628000"," They're at 16 cents now. "
"8628120","8629000"," They're at 26 cents."
"8634120","8635440"," 27 cents now."
"8641790","8643030"," Keep on going, baby. "
"8643470","8644970"," 404c now, 27 cents."
"8645250","8645770"," 28 cents."
"8650250","8651270"," Keep on going. "
"8658240","8659940"," I'm going to put some stops on this."
"8668100","8668660"," 404c."
"8672120","8673960"," Come on, keep squeezing. "
"8674420","8675300"," Squeeze up the 404."
"8675680","8676240"," Let's go."
"8676460","8676840"," Move up there. "
"8678980","8679960"," Get up going."
"8680420","8681340"," Get going up there."
"8682960","8684140"," Let's push on 404. "
"8686200","8687900"," 404c is now 32 cents."
"8688140","8688740"," 30 cents."
"8690700","8692320"," Raise stops as we move. "
"8692520","8693340"," I'm at 30 now."
"8696220","8698520"," Now 33 cents on 404c."

"8713320","8714540"," Here we go."
"8714760","8715740"," Get ready to take some profit."
"8715940","8718220"," We're almost coming in to taking profit up here. "
"8718660","8719940"," 37 cents."

"8722760","8723460"," 40 cents. "
"8725380","8727660"," Take some money off the table as we get up here."
"8729880","8730840"," Keep pushing."

"8743280","8744600"," There you go, doggy."
"8744960","8747660"," Take some money off the table."
"8747860","8750640"," Continue downside movement in the dollar. "
"8751640","8753080"," I closed calls up here."
"8753400","8753820"," 40 cents."
"8755020","8755820"," There you go. "
"8756520","8757400"," Hot damn."
"8758260","8759020"," Look at that move."
"8760580","8761620"," Look at that tag. "
"8763000","8764680"," Look at that yellow bar up there."
"8766140","8767700"," What is going on?"
"8770640","8773800"," What is going on out there?"
"8774540","8775800"," What's going on out there?"
"8775940","8776420"," Twitterverse."
"8777000","8778620"," What's going on there, YouTubeverse?"
"8779440","8780560"," Look at that move. "
"8780860","8781680"," Where can we go next?"
"8782840","8783820"," Where's the move next?"
"8786640","8787840"," Right up in here."
"8788780","8790180"," Make sure you take for profit."
"8790880","8791700"," Take your money. "
"8796080","8797180"," Oh, yeah."
"8797860","8798140"," Oh."
"8801110","8802070"," Come on. "
"8802210","8804050"," Hold on a second here."
"8804370","8805290"," I'm flat right now."
"8805430","8806050"," Just heads up. "
"8807230","8808090"," Hold on a second."
"8817130","8818090"," Oh, yeah."
"8820650","8822370"," You want to see where top is?"
"8823230","8824230"," Top is right here. "
"8824390","8827090"," You see above it that red bar that I have?"
"8828790","8829570"," That's right here."
"8829710","8832790"," So this is just before in the bar."
"8833050","8835390"," The real sellers are above somewhere up in here. "
"8835610","8836250"," Look at that move."
"8837570","8839110"," Look at that move higher."
"8839710","8849690"," I don't know"
"8849690","8851210"," what the fuck is going on with my camera. "
"8852030","8854190"," See the old rises as much as they're a spot."
"8854410","8856670"," Eight percent after the FOMC meeting."
"8857070","8858310"," I'm going to bring you back to book map. "
"8858490","8859870"," There's a little bit of resistance here."
"8860010","8862950"," If you look, I want you to see this little yellow white bar up here."
"8864610","8866090"," See this little bit of resistance. "
"8866430","8868050"," You might get a little bit of a reversal here."
"8868450","8869970"," I'm going to switch back for you."
"8871290","8872670"," I'm going to switch back for you. "
"8872710","8875690"," We're going to look for a place to buy another dip for the next leg up."
"8877030","8878030"," So we're going to go."
"8878470","8879910"," I'm going to switch back over right here. "
"8879950","8882930"," We'll be expecting comments from all the ends that's gotten to all."
"8888780","8889460"," Right there."
"8889560","8891400"," And you'll be looking for another push up right here. "
"8891420","8892580"," You'll be looking for some consolidation."
"8892580","8895320"," And I move higher in a tag right up there."
"8895460","8895660"," Okay. "
"8896060","8897160"," Let's see if we can get that consumption."
"8897380","8898860"," We might go as low as possible."
"8898880","8902420"," We could go right down to this 40180 and then move up. "
"8902640","8904180"," So be careful where you buy the dip."
"8904540","8907940"," You could have a quick rejection, which we're getting a liquidity grab down here."
"8908540","8911620"," Just be conscious of this yellow line right here that we've got. "
"8911760","8911960"," Okay."
"8914900","8915720"," Hold on here."
"8923760","8925600"," That's the initial bar up right there. "
"8926520","8930080"," And we're going to change the color on that."
"8930080","8930480"," That's white."
"8936580","8938040"," Let's see if we can get another move higher. "
"8944070","8945910"," So that's the initial move right."
"8946150","8947410"," We took the initial move."
"8947610","8948590"," We sold for profit. "
"8949250","8950710"," We're looking for the next move up."
"8951450","8953750"," We're going to look for one more move if we can get it there."
"8954370","8958370"," We'll take a look at book map and we'll take a look and see if there's another trade higher. "
"8958930","8961370"," You guys want to watch book map or do you want to what do you guys want to watch?"
"8967250","8968870"," Almost perfect, right?"
"8969310","8970250"," Almost perfect."
"8976900","8978000"," Hang tight here."
"8997770","8999510"," Almost perfect fucking move. "
"9000750","9002550"," Perfect tag on the yellow line."
"9006870","9010150"," Yeah, it was the comments that killed last FMC."
"9011590","9013170"," It was the fucking comments. "
"9020410","9022630"," Nice little dragon pattern here, right?"
"9022890","9023810"," This is what you guys call it."
"9023970","9026470"," That is like all kinds of names for this."
"9032720","9033580"," Right there. "
"9033900","9035400"," Boom, boom, one, two, three."
"9037820","9038700"," Slam it up."
"9038980","9039540"," Come back down. "
"9040060","9040400"," Consolidate."
"9041180","9042880"," Hope for the next move up higher."
"9043540","9046660"," I do want you to be aware they will reprice options at some point. "
"9047300","9048580"," So be careful about that."
"9052970","9055130"," There are some sellers coming in right now."
"9055290","9056430"," You might want to cut. "
"9056550","9060150"," You might put in some stop loss or some limits right here."
"9060150","9062610"," I want you to know we're floating around right now on book map."
"9063390","9064090"," Just be careful. "
"9064350","9066490"," They might try to send it back down and reset options here."
"9067230","9067710"," So be careful."
"9072050","9073650"," Just floating around here. "
"9075030","9076310"," It might take one more trade."
"9077030","9078010"," I'm going to look right now."
"9078190","9080450"," Let's look at the options chain into next week. "
"9081290","9082990"," We have 25th, right?"
"9083530","9084450"," Oh, man."
"9084530","9086110"," Everybody's got puts on the 25th."
"9086110","9089450"," They bought 400 P's for fucking bears, man. "
"9090150","9094990"," They're loaded to the tits at 400 P for November 25th."
"9094990","9101790"," A bunch of call buyers on 403 C for November 28th, 25,000 calls."
"9103210","9107170"," A bunch of call buyers for November 29th. "
"9109460","9115140"," So we were correct in our assumption that the initial that the minutes would be."
"9117100","9118980"," Very, very dovish."
"9119760","9121040"," Rather than hawkish. "
"9121400","9124640"," That is why Jay Powell came out and tried to stomp on the market."
"9126780","9129240"," I don't know what's going on my camera here."
"9129900","9131580"," Having all kinds of camera problems. "
"9134440","9137520"," Here's the main stream so you guys can check this out right here."
"9137520","9138880"," I want to buy this dip."
"9139080","9144000"," So what I'm afraid of is they reprice it that they like they dump it down here. "
"9144380","9146220"," And then they do a continuation up."
"9149200","9152360"," But I'd really like to buy this last push up higher here."
"9152980","9156000"," And there's kind of like a so on book map at least. "
"9157140","9160060"," If you look at book map, it's not showing any support here."
"9161460","9163700"," I don't like seeing that empty book right there."
"9163740","9165580"," You see you see how that book is kind of empty. "
"9170090","9172250"," It's a pretty weak book down to."
"9174990","9176970"," It's a weak book to write about here."
"9178950","9179750"," Right there. "
"9180010","9182150"," Almost like they want to bring it right back down."
"9182630","9183750"," Maybe send it back up."
"9184190","9185350"," So be careful in here. "
"9186830","9190510"," We could easily quick red bar down then jump back up."
"9190670","9191090"," So be careful."
"9212460","9214560"," Yeah, we are starting to roll over real quick. "
"9214820","9216960"," I'm going to look to try to enter this somewhere in here."
"9218000","9219020"," I think before."
"9219180","9220440"," Yeah, we before we did this. "
"9220620","9222380"," I told you guys it's a directional move, right?"
"9222680","9225520"," You jump in, take the move, and then you take profit."
"9227200","9232300"," Came back to VWAP on 401.20. I'm going to check."
"9232600","9234800"," I want to check what people are talking about. "
"9235120","9236660"," So we're getting a VWAPI right here."
"9240740","9243220"," Almost a perfect strike on VWAP right now."
"9246840","9249140"," Yeah, you saw that you saw the yellow line above. "
"9249360","9250200"," We talked about that, right?"
"9250380","9251080"," The initial move."
"9255170","9256830"," Talked about selling up here, right?"
"9256990","9257810"," We already talked about that."
"9257890","9258490"," Good job, Eric. "

"9293920","9294740"," 404 is there. "
"9295040","9296880"," So 403.80. They're not going to print."
"9297740","9298900"," 403 is not a bad trade."
"9299880","9300620"," They're pricey. "
"9302060","9304120"," You see, just do a 10 pack."
"9308460","9310700"," Getting set up here to go long right now."
"9317770","9318950"," Right here. "

"9371190","9374270"," If you follow us regularly, like one, two, three, four, five streams."
"9375030","9375510"," Something like that."
"9376030","9376790"," Not just not an event. "
"9382200","9382720"," I wouldn't do that."
"9382920","9387060"," If I was a trader, I wouldn't be stopping in on anyone's stream first time."
"9387540","9388920"," Yeah, you know what we're going to do?"
"9389040","9394820"," We're going to build a little base here. "
"9397960","9400960"," Come on, 403 C's now for 41 cents."
"9407140","9407920"," Come on, baby."
"9409000","9409860"," Keep on pumping. "
"9411340","9414380"," I'm going to set a stop here at 45 cents in just a second."
"9415740","9418600"," We're at 44, so I'm trying to get above the 45."
"9421850","9425110"," All right, so I got stops on 45 cents on 403 C."
"9425270","9425950"," Oh, that just triggered. "
"9426590","9427830"," That was good for five cents."
"9429390","9434570"," If any of you guys are long here, I set a stop."
"9434730","9436050"," I don't want to see a quick rollover. "
"9436950","9437970"," I made five cents."
"9438050","9438490"," That was it."
"9438910","9441270"," 403 C's are now at 47 cents. "
"9444600","9445260"," Oh, shit."
"9445560","9448820"," Here we go."
"9449610","9450040"," Fuck it. "
"9450100","9450860"," Turn that shit off."

"9472670","9475630"," 403 C's are now 51 cents, 52 cents."
"9476970","9479790"," We bought the dip on 403 C's. "
"9479890","9481470"," They're at 51 cents right now."
"9481670","9485430"," Set some fucking limits below in case it swoops back down, please."
"9485930","9487590"," Protect the money that you're making. "
"9493610","9495470"," We could roll it over here."
"9495610","9496290"," Be careful here."
"9496490","9496570"," Okay. "
"9496710","9498210"," You end up getting a little rollover down."
"9499370","9501310"," Be really careful here."
"9502690","9507670"," All the ends that's governor also as we are efficiently contractionary with policy. "
"9509110","9510010"," Oh, yeah."
"9510330","9510730"," Look at that."
"9511090","9511870"," Oh, yeah. "
"9512270","9512730"," Push it."
"9513590","9514550"," Get up there."
"9515170","9517510"," You don't want to see a roll and then a slam. "
"9517830","9518450"," So be careful."
"9519010","9520590"," You don't want to see it roll over here."
"9521110","9521890"," Tight stops. "
"9522770","9527430"," So you should have a limit stop here and you should be trying to sell here."
"9527610","9527730"," Okay."
"9527850","9529530"," This is where you're starting here. "
"9529690","9529850"," Right?"
"9530190","9532050"," One, two, boom."
"9532530","9533230"," Move it on up."
"9533370","9534230"," That's what you're looking for. "
"9534970","9537270"," You don't want to see it roll down over here."
"9537750","9540330"," If it does roll down to get caught, you don't have limits on it."
"9540330","9548550"," If you don't have limits on it, then you want to have the ability to add to your position. "
"9548750","9549330"," Excuse me."
"9550390","9552990"," So let's say you didn't buy down here."
"9553090","9553710"," You'll see it bought here. "
"9554990","9559550"," If we roll it and then it bounces, you want to add again for that move higher."
"9559810","9560270"," Does that make sense?"
"9563250","9564090"," You guys understand what I'm saying?"
"9565070","9566710"," Could be a quick roll here."
"9567950","9569610"," 403c is now 48 cents. "
"9570510","9573170"," They were down at 42 cents, 40 cents earlier."
"9576230","9576890"," Come on."
"9577030","9577450"," Keep pushing. "
"9577850","9583800"," I want you guys to see a put book back on for you for a minute here."
"9585040","9586440"," Still kind of floating around."
"9587280","9588820"," No real support underneath us. "
"9588940","9591220"," We're looking for those for those sellers above."
"9591920","9596120"," We're looking to tag 4050 on ES 4050."
"9602030","9604510"," J&K has reversed and is heading higher. "
"9605390","9607890"," J&K is going to retest the highs as well."
"9608110","9608730"," They're still pumping."
"9609210","9611850"," Looking to tag 9220 on J&K. "
"9613010","9619030"," Vicks fell down and caught some more support down at 20.64. They're starting to close that gap that"
"9619030","9619650"," was down there."
"9623530","9633490"," Oh, Tesla came right back up and slapped the high at 181.53. Junk bonds coming back from the dead."

"9637290","9646370"," Dixie collapsed and broke through established support at 106.29 and slapped 106.10. Unreal."

"9652270","9654770"," This is what you need is this chart up right here. "
"9656390","9660650"," We'll see if we can get the one, two, three and push up into 4050."

"10216750","10220630"," I just want to slip my hand in their pocket and take out a little bit."
"10220630","10222790"," Just a little bit."
"10224710","10226570"," Y'all get what I'm saying out there?"
"10227270","10228210"," Look at that. "
"10229230","10229890"," Look at that."
"10230010","10231830"," Couldn't trade this more perfect."
"10233130","10234670"," Couldn't trade this more perfect. "
"10236830","10237450"," Stunning."
"10241370","10245330"," Just slip my hand inside of those old white greasy handed pockets."
"10246210","10249330"," Empty, empty suits with a Yale education. "
"10252910","10256550"," I'm going to bring you back right here to book maps so you can see exactly where we are."
"10257190","10259970"," You see that little bit of resistance we're coming into right now."
"10260070","10261610"," There's one more little move higher. "
"10262590","10262790"," Okay."
"10262910","10266270"," So we're going to try to green bar it up to that one little big bar."
"10266410","10270870"," If you are still long calls right here, it's going to be fast. "
"10271190","10271450"," Okay."
"10272030","10273370"," So you're going to see a move."
"10274430","10279330"," If you're still, if you've left some on at this point, right, and it does blast up. "
"10279510","10281610"," I want you to know it's going to be like wam, wam."
"10281930","10286010"," So sets themselves, takes some profit, put a stop loss here."
"10286950","10287630"," Protect your money. "
"10287890","10289230"," Don't be giving money back to the house."
"10289410","10292270"," There's no reason for you to be giving money back to the house."
"10293130","10293230"," Right. "
"10293890","10294450"," So what do we got?"
"10294650","10295870"," We got one trade right here."
"10297290","10298490"," Got another trade right here."
"10298830","10298870"," Boom. "
"10300390","10302870"," And we're hoping for one more up here."
"10305670","10307610"," Do not give your money back to the house."
"10311230","10313290"," I'm going to bring you back to book map right here. "
"10315090","10316130"," And we'll come right back."
"10316270","10316430"," I'm here."
"10316530","10319390"," We'll see if this is going to roll or if we're going to. "
"10325190","10326130"," Right about there."
"10331460","10333280"," Also note where VWAP is."
"10335300","10337940"," Also note that we have VWAP right in here. "
"10344950","10346930"," I know some of you guys love trading VWAP."
"10350870","10353990"," Have some more significant rolling and book map right now."
"10354470","10354990"," Be careful. "
"10355170","10356510"," Take your money and run if you need to."
"10361090","10363030"," Following the release of the Fed five minutes."
"10363330","10365450"," Right futures in the United States. "
"10365510","10370670"," Anticipate a terminal rate of 5.03% in the June Fed meeting."
"10372010","10376720"," US rate futures slightly raised chances of 50 BPS hike to 79%."
"10378330","10380850"," In December meeting after the Fed minutes. "
"10383550","10384390"," Fed minutes."
"10384650","10386890"," Several Fed officials predicted that interest rates."
"10387770","10389310"," With peak at a higher level. "
"10389650","10393530"," I think we talked about this earlier in the broadcast and that is the."
"10394270","10395890"," The real the real like."
"10396790","10400050"," It's interesting in that what they're highlighting in this. "
"10400390","10402370"," Well, this information that they're highlighting right now."
"10403510","10407590"," Is they're trying to downplay the feds the Fed pausing."
"10408390","10411690"," And trying to lead us on into the December meeting. "
"10413110","10415470"," So they're like, yeah, we're going to we're thinking about."
"10415730","10416910"," Thinking about thinking about."
"10421010","10422530"," We're really going to know in December. "
"10422910","10425570"," You see the see the context of that."
"10425910","10427130"," How I said that to you."
"10428250","10431270"," So they're thinking about thinking about, but we're going to make the decision in December. "
"10432890","10434530"," So what they're what are they trying to do."
"10435270","10439410"," Let the market play out until December 15th and then that's when they tell you."
"10439530","10440330"," Yeah, we're pausing. "
"10441390","10442770"," We're going to slow the pace."
"10444070","10449770"," Here's a 50 BPS, but we're slowing or pausing from here and then you'll get the bloodbath from"
"10449770","10450890"," December 14th into."
"10452510","10452870"," Springtime. "
"10456050","10457270"," So that's kind of concerning."
"10462620","10463360"," Yeah, it's a tough."
"10463500","10465180"," I mean, we know we're at the top here, right?"
"10466220","10466960"," We know that. "
"10471960","10473280"," It's going to roll at some point."
"10473380","10473980"," We know that, right?"
"10474480","10475820"," We know at some point we're going to get up here."
"10477420","10479180"," Even if we get up here, we know it's rolling. "
"10480380","10483900"," That's up three dollars and one cents or three spots, seven, two percent."
"10484800","10486500"," I don't think we're breaking through up here."
"10493840","10496500"," You know what I am interested in is. "
"10497360","10498880"," If we were to sell this close."
"10500480","10502680"," You know, take your money and run weekends here."
"10505390","10508310"," I'd be interested in buying a close that's lower. "
"10509010","10511350"," If it's low enough, if it's not low enough."
"10512310","10515270"," I'm not interested in holding anything through Friday."
"10516130","10516970"," Beware too. "
"10517450","10522090"," If you're taking lungs or shorts there, always buy spreads."
"10523710","10529470"," Because you got theta burn on Friday and you got, you got what, four days of theta burn."
"10529750","10531810"," You don't want to fuck with any of that over the weekend. "
"10532550","10537010"," You do not want to be fucked with anything but spreads if you're going to long after today."
"10538330","10541800"," I'm trying to see."
"10542180","10544920"," There's a book map showing some more resistance at this point. "
"10546120","10547220"," Let's see what happens here."
"10547440","10548160"," I'm flat right now."
"10549780","10551200"," Let me look at the options chain. "
"10552580","10555700"," Yeah, they've got 272,000 calls on 402."
"10556480","10557780"," That's 75 cents right now."
"10558500","10562160"," I wonder if they burn those into the bell because there's so many people on the call side. "
"10564480","10566380"," People are selling out of their positions right now."
"10566420","10567500"," You can see these big red bars."
"10568340","10570400"," I would take money and run at some point in here. "
"10578110","10581690"," Let me know if you're still in the market or still long or not."
"10582850","10587870"," If you get a chance in here, if you are still long and you get a chance to break even"
"10587870","10590770"," on this trade, I would attempt to."
"10594010","10596290"," I'm afraid they're going to create it sideways right into the bell. "
"10600760","10602340"," You guys have 404 is tough."
"10602520","10602740"," They're crap."
"10603080","10603880"," Oh, about the VW up. "
"10604060","10604680"," I'm going to low up."
"10604800","10605780"," Yup, fixed climbing."
"10607360","10610980"," The minute said rate hikes target is higher, but they're slowing the pace. "
"10611920","10612780"," Thanks, Omar, for the update."
"10614160","10616480"," 7.5 million shares traded on the spy outstate."
"10616660","10617620"," Thanks for all the updates, Omar. "
"10617920","10620520"," Sean too, whoever the other guy was that was dropping science."
"10621060","10622080"," Zach Burton, good to see you in here."
"10624200","10625120"," Yeah, okay, Zach. "
"10625360","10625800"," This is a good time."
"10626060","10627140"," Yeah, we can talk about that right now."
"10632400","10636080"," We can talk about that right now. "
"10639840","10643340"," I don't want to buy put spreads."
"10644540","10646020"," Until we hit four."
"10646880","10648020"," I don't want to truth is. "
"10652960","10653760"," Truth is."
"10654820","10656740"," This is where I want to buy put spreads up here."
"10657160","10658220"," I want to buy them right there. "
"10660840","10662320"," Or I'd buy them right here too."
"10663520","10665500"," This is when Jay Pao speaks right here."
"10666900","10668540"," So Jay Pao speaking right here. "
"10669940","10674640"," So what I really want to do is right now I want to buy this dip and run this up"
"10674640","10676340"," into the 30th."
"10678540","10682620"," I like to get some kind of a bloodbath from Jay Pao."
"10684020","10685620"," And then buy this dip. "
"10687340","10688320"," To December 15th."
"10690820","10693800"," And then in December 15th or 16th."
"10694660","10698880"," I'd like to sell this and I'd like to sell December 15th or 16th into March. "
"10701220","10702680"," Down to like 3500."
"10703620","10705100"," That's a 500 point drop."
"10706080","10708440"," As a matter of fact, in the March, I'd like to see 3200. "
"10712950","10713930"," Something like that."
"10714190","10714610"," I'd like to."
"10714730","10715310"," That's what I'd like. "
"10716490","10719890"," So maybe if I was to clean it up, I posted something earlier where I was like."
"10719890","10721650"," I want something like that."
"10728780","10730800"," And then of course, everyone's going to get super bearish. "
"10730960","10733700"," They're going to fucking buy fucking all the goddamn plates that are available."
"10733980","10736700"," It's going to rock it back up into the 15th."
"10738260","10739480"," It's actually farther out. "
"10741400","10743040"," Pretend this goes to the 15th."
"10746100","10747800"," And then in the 15th, we'll roll it over."
"10747960","10750980"," You'll see all the Peru's come out and say we're tax loss harvesting. "
"10750980","10755760"," We'll drop down, hit 3500, get a relief bounce, 50% of the retracement."
"10756080","10758560"," Then we'll head back down into March, the 3200."
"10760520","10761300"," Does that make sense?"
"10762420","10764000"," You guys understand what I'm coming from in that?"
"10765020","10767220"," So I'm not going to hold a position tomorrow. "
"10767680","10768780"," I'd really like to see."
"10769660","10772660"," I'd really like to see like by Monday."
"10775340","10776580"," So what is this tomorrow?"
"10777300","10779600"," If this is Monday, I'd like to see us right here. "
"10780980","10782460"," I'd even like to see us right here."
"10782520","10785420"," I'd like to buy this down here on Monday somewhere in here."
"10786260","10787620"," I'd take either of those. "
"10788340","10789440"," I'll be in this Conway."
"10789860","10792620"," So significant slowdown is coming in home construction."
"10794380","10798980"," And if you're looking for put spreads for blood baths on the market. "
"10802160","10803580"," There's back to VWAP again."
"10803800","10805220"," You see this VWAP trade they're doing?"
"10809380","10814980"," If you're looking for like where to buy put spreads where you don't think about them."
"10816240","10818440"," I think every bear out there would want. "
"10820460","10822720"," You know, it's not really the price that matters."
"10823220","10824940"," It's where we are that matters."
"10826100","10827800"," It's somewhere up here, right?"
"10828580","10830860"," It's here and as time passes, it's here. "
"10831760","10838120"," If there's ever a spike up here and you didn't any bottom, let's say, let's say you bought put"
"10838120","10839080"," spreads right here."
"10839740","10843080"," Unless you put like three months on them or something, they may not print."
"10844860","10848900"," So I would really like the best positioning is somewhere up here. "
"10850540","10852000"," I think people know that."
"10852900","10854460"," So people are expecting that."
"10854600","10855500"," We've done that every time. "
"10857080","10859320"," So can we roll it here though by put spreads?"
"10859580","10859620"," Sure."
"10860480","10863500"," If they're close in the money put spreads, they'll still print eventually."
"10864760","10866440"," If you want that safety, sure. "
"10866900","10872920"," Doing the money put spreads that expire on December 30th or something."
"10873400","10876040"," I don't know whatever the last strike is in December."
"10878340","10879520"," Or buy them from March. "
"10880520","10882300"," I'm sure we'll come back down here by March."
"10885470","10886350"," I'm sure he will."
"10889720","10892640"," If you want my take on where we are, I'm still bullish. "
"10892880","10893540"," We haven't broken trend."
"10894560","10897520"," So we're probably going to trade this next couple of days."
"10898840","10900380"," We have not broken trend yet. "
"10901900","10903280"," So I'm still bullish here."
"10903440","10906440"," I'm bullish until we get right here."
"10908860","10910220"," Or we break trend. "
"10911140","10913760"," Then I'll trade that down and then I'll trade that down right there."
"10915780","10917280"," But we have not broken trend."
"10917620","10919020"," Nothing says we're bearish here. "
"10919900","10924560"," The only thing that could be bearish here would be that we're at the top of this channel."
"10925100","10928080"," But if we trade above it and hold it, I'm bullish to here."
"10929120","10930180"," It's kind of like no man. "
"10930300","10931540"," This is kind of what Brian wants to say."
"10931640","10932460"," No diggling in the middle."
"10933100","10938200"," We're kind of diggling in the middle right now for a long term trade. "
"10939440","10941600"," You want to break above this channel for this move higher?"
"10943820","10946320"," You want to close above this today for a move higher?"
"10947000","10947840"," If you don't."
"10949020","10950960"," The trade is probably down for more support."
"10950960","10951720"," Move higher. "
"10953200","10954200"," I think that's it."
"10960760","10964180"," Yeah, so I want to buy a dip on Friday or Monday."
"10965640","10967120"," We're still sitting on VWAP. "
"10968480","10969980"," Some sellers coming in right now."
"10974060","10975040"," So let's see what happens."
"10977600","10979060"," Bears are doubling down, right?"
"10979880","10983190"," I need more money. "
"10984350","10985190"," You're welcome, Zach."
"10988400","10989360"," So let's look at."
"10991500","10992880"," You guys all understand that?"
"10993040","10993980"," Do you guys understand that?"
"10994900","10997620"," So, you know, we're in a channel and a channel heading up. "
"10998820","11001780"," So those places that you want to buy that channel until it fails."
"11004840","11008800"," So that channel, just on this, this is a one minute chart, like in a five minute chart."
"11009980","11011160"," We're at the top of the channel. "
"11011400","11013460"," This yellow line is the top of that channel."
"11014840","11016380"," You want to be bullish for tomorrow?"
"11018280","11020240"," Then you need the close above."
"11022660","11031420"," If we close above here today, this is bullish for an extension on Friday, believe it or not. "
"11033720","11035620"," It doesn't always go there, but it's bullish."
"11036380","11039160"," It's a bullish close for an extension on Friday."
"11040420","11045500"," What would suck would be if you bought calls for that extension, just like fucking buying calls, no"
"11045500","11045800"," spreads?"
"11046660","11049180"," You probably wouldn't get paid because of the theta. "
"11050220","11051740"," Not guaranteed, but."
"11054840","11056000"," So that's what bulls want."
"11056160","11059500"," Like mega uber duper bulls want to see that. "
"11059760","11060320"," I don't personally."
"11060840","11065080"," I want to see some weakness by a dip and run it up."
"11066020","11067380"," So I'm with the bears here. "
"11068240","11069500"," Push this shit down."
"11077020","11078200"," Vwops trading right now."
"11092730","11094290"," But you guys aren't seeing this, are you?"
"11095630","11096170"," Hold on. "
"11096470","11096670"," Sorry."
"11096810","11097290"," I go back to the chart."
"11097550","11097650"," Okay. "
"11097950","11100590"," So we're holding Vwop down here to see you can see."
"11100650","11106750"," So what I was trying to say is this is that channel, right?"
"11109370","11111590"," You can see the close up right here, right?"
"11111850","11113670"," The stream is sponsored by to the tick."
"11113670","11120510"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"11120950","11123710"," So the bulls want to close above here. "
"11124970","11128840"," This is bullish bullish for an extension into Friday right here."
"11130030","11134930"," A bearish, well not bearish, but you don't want to see the clothes down here."
"11135170","11141870"," See the clothes down here and first we're going to trade lower for some new support into Friday or"
"11141870","11142090"," Monday. "
"11142770","11144930"," So, so that's what you're looking for."
"11145650","11149910"," If you're if you're like mega mega bull, you want to be closing above here."
"11150330","11154970"," And Aubian says governor or says the financial system can withstand rising unemployment. "
"11156030","11157750"," You see, hold on a second here."
"11160490","11166150"," Now seeing ice brand crude oil, January futures setting at $85.41 a barrel."
"11166410","11169830"," It's down $2.95 or 3.34% on this session. "
"11170650","11172830"," So you see this big giant move up, right?"
"11173210","11174570"," Look at this big giant move up here."
"11175230","11175630"," Swoof."
"11176470","11176910"," Bam. "
"11177670","11179210"," If you close here, right?"
"11179990","11181810"," Bam move higher right there."
"11182670","11188050"," Now if you fail to close above there, it shows exhaustion of the bulls, right?"
"11188810","11192310"," You don't want to be like be exhausted in here, right?"
"11193350","11197690"," Because if you get exhaustion, you'll be looking for more buyers to get up there, right?"
"11197870","11200450"," Or at least to continue higher down the road."
"11202150","11205190"," So bulls are fighting to close on the high here. "
"11205430","11208550"," If we do close on the high, I'm bullish for Friday."
"11208890","11215390"," If we close below, I'm going to look to buy a dip down here on Friday or Monday somewhere in"
"11215390","11215570"," there."
"11216590","11217070"," Make sense?"
"11230080","11235380"," Vwap is the kind of a thing where there's Vwap for you or there's book map for you. "
"11235460","11235920"," That's book map."
"11236160","11237080"," This is the regular chart."
"11237820","11243600"," So if traders, day traders buy Vwap, right?"
"11243800","11244800"," See this orange line right here?"
"11245620","11247260"," They sell Vwap, they buy Vwap. "
"11247400","11249060"," If we're above Vwap, we're bullish."
"11249940","11252460"," If we trade below Vwap, we're bearish."
"11253260","11256140"," You reclaim Vwap, you become bullish, right?"
"11257000","11262180"," You know that if we traded it, we traded above Vwap, we found support. "
"11262940","11267840"," We found support typically one, two, max three."
"11268660","11271700"," You'll finally get your push higher that you need if you're still bullish."
"11272940","11273320"," Make sense?"
"11273860","11275100"," Sometimes it takes three times. "
"11280860","11285720"," So we'll be checking to see if, sorry, I'm trying to do three things at once."
"11288260","11292560"," So one, two, three, we'll see if the bulls can just push it up one more time."
"11293820","11295960"," Okay, so I'm going to wrap this up with you guys today. "
"11296080","11297660"," I wanted to say thanks for joining me."
"11298420","11299140"," Happy Thanksgiving."

"11304380","11309060"," If you want my take on what I think is going to happen on Friday and Monday, I'm waiting for"
"11309060","11312220"," a buy at a lower price."
"11312220","11315860"," I want to see, I would like to see like a Friday or a Monday dip buy. "
"11317120","11321480"," I'm still waiting for that next dip buy right now other than day trading zero dates."
"11321880","11324120"," I'd like to buy with a little bit more confidence down lower."
"11324900","11329600"," If we do close into this ballot for PM above, you know my thoughts. "
"11329920","11330820"," We will gap up."
"11332640","11333940"," Come on Friday."
"11334920","11337660"," I'm going to expect a gap up on Friday if we close above. "
"11340140","11342040"," I'll give you an exact price right now."
"11357860","11359340"," Or like a hand raised price."
"11359640","11360480"," We close above 402. "
"11370530","11374810"," If we close about 402 or bullish in the Monday for a 30 point gap."
"11376750","11377570"," How about that?"
"11389910","11391390"," This yellow line right here."
"11391490","11392290"," See this yellow line?"
"11393510","11395830"," You close above this yellow line into the bell. "
"11396210","11397070"," That's fucking bullish."

"11723260","11724040"," That's an old school."
"11724420","11726160"," If you guys don't know what that is, that's Kilroy."
"11726400","11727640"," He's from the 1940s. "

"12399270","12400670"," Almost to the pin. "
"12401950","12402470"," 50%."
"12402470","12403390"," Look at that."
"12403810","12404330"," 50%. "
"12404330","12405850"," Look at that."
"12405990","12407830"," Dude, this chart is so sexy."
"12409070","12412270"," So this morning we talked about the 50% retracement. "
"12412610","12417250"," We tagged it and then we talked about what would be the next logical move here."
"12418090","12422610"," Well, what we've been seeing is you want to see."
"12425940","12428260"," The 50% retracement, right?"
"12429540","12433220"," And so you want to see this 50% retracement here. "
"12434080","12439200"," And usually you'll get a second bump higher to 61%."
"12439740","12443020"," And then and then resume the trend down."
"12443360","12445460"," Now the timing on this is not the next week. "
"12446020","12447840"," But this is what you're looking for."
"12448040","12450760"," It could be, if you want it more exact, it'd be something like."
"12452820","12456380"," You guys, any guys tuning in, you guys know what's up, right?"
"12456760","12459160"," So we hit the 50% retracement, right?"
"12459820","12463080"," So you're probably going to be looking at something like this, right?"
"12464720","12469680"," Wait, may Friday or Monday and then a resumption trade into the 15th. "
"12471080","12472160"," Does that make sense?"
"12472160","12476680"," And then we start selling the market on the, whatever the 15th isn't here."
"12479500","12480560"," Something like this."
"12486350","12487390"," So 50%. "
"12487390","12493870"," But the price target above, if you want to know the price target above on Tesla, let's take a look."
"12495030","12501090"," We broke out of, we closed the gap, we broke out of the traditional resistance levels."
"12501090","12509610"," Price target above remains the same, 187.26. On the top of the key, it's 187.69. So 187 is"
"12509610","12509790"," murder. "
"12511890","12512790"," So there you go."
"12513890","12515010"," How do you like them apples?"
"12517630","12523630"," Adam, if you're going to be alone for Thanksgiving, don't hesitate to reach out and shoot the shit"
