"81580","83340"," Good morning, good morning, good morning."
"84660","86660"," Pile in, pile in, pile in."
"89680","91080"," Alright, what do you got going on here?"
"91280","92240"," Let me check out Twitch. "
"93880","95420"," I have to go like the mod view."
"97960","98960"," Everybody's doing well out there."
"99260","100900"," Supposedly you guys like when you see me. "
"102440","104420"," I got to send out this thing over here too."
"105160","107500"," I've got a gift for a winner of a."
"109200","110820"," We got to still haven't sent it out."
"111040","114360"," He caught up in and I checked my DMS and I forgot to check my DMS. So."
"116500","118900"," Go right to the main screener right here."
"121560","124540"," Good morning, good afternoon to all of you that are out there right now. "
"125200","126460"," We have a little bit of a new format."
"126860","128419"," If you're just tuning in for the first time."
"131840","134900"," See if I can do something here too. "
"136850","137730"," Hold on here."
"140890","142250"," Here, copy."
"143230","146250"," And then do here. "
"147090","148630"," Not on Twitch too much anymore."
"148790","149050"," Twitch."
"150370","151370"," Twitter too often anymore. "
"153030","157450"," Should be, but I'm not."
"163310","164950"," I didn't realize that."
"164950","174780"," I was told that we post another one here for the"
"184410","185830"," stream. "
"191870","196990"," I was told that now that everyone wants, I guess."
"197710","199530"," So let me know if you know about this or not."
"201030","202950"," So everybody wants a."
"205370","207430"," We'll get into this here in just a minute, but. "
"207430","210170"," I guess everyone wants."
"216960","222040"," Everybody wants on on Twitter."
"222720","225460"," I'm not going to call it the other name because the other name's fucking stupid. "
"226240","233780"," It's like a 20 year old dork came up with the name X."
"233980","234260"," I'm sorry."
"234780","235400"," Can't do it."
"235720","246910"," I'm not going"
"246910","246910"," to. "
"247790","250270"," People want to get paid for posting on Twitter."
"251030","252210"," I was told that."
"253090","255870"," We're going to go out there and grind out a bunch of these stops, by the way. "
"258010","258510"," I'm kind of."
"258850","260390"," They have a bunch of tech you guys about."
"260670","260850"," So. "
"262470","264530"," I think I finally had it with one of my brokers."
"264970","269060"," I think I'm finally done with one of my brokers."
"270580","271180"," But. "
"272080","272800"," Twitter, right?"
"273220","275440"," So people are trying to."
"276080","276680"," Now."
"277840","278200"," Get traction. "
"278800","280280"," So they can get followers."
"283010","283790"," Where they're real."
"283950","285190"," No one really cared about followers. "
"285450","286750"," Now people are caring about followers."
"287070","289490"," So they can share in revenue."
"290810","291730"," On Twitter. "
"292070","292950"," This is kind of like."
"293330","296130"," A microcosm of what I don't like about."
"297590","301230"," Social media, including YouTube and Twitch, to some extent, to be honest. "
"302490","305770"," Not as much with Twitch and YouTube, but Twitter specifically."
"306710","307850"," You can it's glaring."
"308470","308610"," So. "
"309270","311990"," I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but."
"312890","317830"," Now there's a race to get a hundred thousand followers, million followers, whatever you can get."
"318290","320690"," So this is what we're paying for right on Twitter. "
"321650","322030"," Is."
"323590","327290"," To you that you want to get a hundred thousand followers or more."
"328530","331710"," And you're now going to change how you. "
"332550","335310"," Tweet and engage with your audience."
"336130","337750"," For your friends."
"338970","341790"," Or your followers or whatever you. "
"342050","344510"," Whatever Twitter is to."
"346800","349480"," There's a race now on Twitter."
"350780","351720"," To. "
"353990","356870"," Make posts that you'll spend."
"357590","359870"," Ten seconds on or."
"360590","362330"," Twenty seconds on. "
"362990","364630"," Or a minute."
"366030","368790"," So rather than just post."
"368790","370830"," Some relevant information. "
"371870","377470"," Well, let alone if you don't pay for the blue check mark, but you can now hide supposedly."
"380580","384300"," I guess you can still see if someone has a blue check mark under certain circumstances."
"385580","387320"," But you're like here pay eight bucks. "
"387880","388500"," Okay, pay."
"388680","389740"," I pay the eight dollars."
"391100","392880"," I pay it because I need functionality. "
"394080","397560"," On the back end that I can't get without paying the eight dollars."
"397980","401780"," I'm being forced into it and I'm being forced and all kinds of other stuff too."
"402540","408340"," I'm trying to build webhook bots and stuff in the background and things for discord that kind of"
"408340","408460"," stuff. "
"408460","413380"," I'm like and not only am I paying the eight, but I'm being asked to pay way more in the"
"413380","413740"," background."
"414360","417000"," Some of the ask on what I'm being paid is outrageous."
"418380","419340"," Like straight up outrageous. "
"422500","424020"," And, but not only that."
"426490","431230"," You're some people or you're or I know for a fact that some people are out there and what they're"
"431230","431690"," doing is."
"432050","433650"," Instead of now just telling you. "
"434250","436210"," The are giving you good information."
"437110","440530"," They're having you like solve puzzles on their posts."
"441530","444530"," We're giving you options like over here. "
"444770","446410"," It could be one of these four things."
"447950","451010"," I want you to know think about what the answer is."
"451250","453550"," And by the way, tell me the answer. "
"454790","458950"," In a comment so that you're engaging with my posts."
"460910","464670"," And you're also leaving comments so other people can read those comments."
"465450","468090"," And so they can send ads to you. "
"468290","470050"," So I just think it's fascinating that."
"471570","475730"," You didn't have to do that to some extent before."
"476450","479610"," And how quickly it's changing to that model where. "
"481050","482350"," You know, it's like."
"483050","484310"," Wasn't just a cool."
"485430","487750"," Handle or it wasn't just a cool. "
"489250","490930"," There's like a there's like a."
"491870","493030"," How it's written."
"494670","497090"," Post and how do you engage with that post."
"498250","499850"," It's fundamentally changing. "
"501190","503350"," What makes Twitter kind of great."
"503970","508910"," The only thing I can relate this to or somewhere else I can relate this to is."
"509110","511929"," So anyways, the point here is that you lose flavor. "
"513330","515850"," And different accounts on Twitter."
"517780","522179"," Different accounts on Twitter would have different flavors to them and how they interacted with"
"522179","522360"," you."
"522700","525440"," Now there's a format the best format. "
"526360","527960"," For people to make money."
"530380","535620"," So you're going to start to see this like race to the bottom of how do we beat the algorithms"
"535620","536480"," and make money on Twitter."
"537280","539260"," What I don't think I relate this to is. "
"540160","541880"," Back in the day on old Reddit."
"543500","547100"," Not the new Reddit or the Reddit app, but on old Reddit."
"548520","553800"," You could make a post with a title or a picture. "
"555820","558280"," Or not the not the picture, but like the title."
"559800","563640"," And then only if you clicked on it to get into the comments."
"564740","571970"," Would you see the answer or the picture or the picture that you could actually see what it blew up"
"571970","572210"," to. "
"572990","579310"," So it's kind of cool like the interplay of you'd be scrolling through old Reddit and you'd see a"
"579310","579690"," post."
"580390","587490"," And it would trigger you to click into the comments and then it would be like the the answer to"
"587490","588310"," a joke or."
"589490","593850"," Something that looked like something on the on the front page front page or your subreddit page. "
"593930","597530"," And it was different when you opened it up and that was really fucking cool."
"598390","602350"," Now when they switched from the old Reddit to new Reddit or the app."
"603450","606830"," You lost that coolness to doing that. "
"607310","611470"," Now that's not saying that Twitter is cooler by clicking through into the comments to the"
"611470","611810"," discussion."
"612230","617570"," It can be, but it's not the original intent of what made Twitter kind of cool, which was sometimes"
"617570","622190"," for some people just the original post or you did sometimes find."
"623630","628070"," Cool comments sections answers to crazy questions and things like that. "
"628670","631170"," But now it's like it's like switched to."
"633170","634590"," That's not karma farming."
"634770","636150"," It's money farming on Twitter. "
"636430","637490"," So I don't know."
"639050","642030"," So now, but I guess I haven't been on Twitter a lot lately."
"642250","642370"," Twitter. "
"646410","646850"," Twitter."
"649560","650580"," I tweet sometimes."
"650940","652540"," I try to get on there, but I don't get on there as much. "
"652540","653240"," It's Twitter."
"655000","662940"," And, you know, I'm kind of like some of my friends that are on Twitter still a lot."
"663680","667600"," I like have some really good follows people that I'm actually considering my friends. "
"668100","674100"," And they're all switching to this different way of tweeting and interacting with Twitter."
"675540","677400"," And we're not liking it."
"677480","682800"," Now I haven't noticed it yet myself, but I guess that is going on in Twitter. "
"682800","683300"," Twitter."
"687030","689190"," What do you call when you tweet now?"
"691620","694000"," Tell me in the chat what you call it when you tweet now."
"695160","695920"," You excrete. "
"699280","700040"," Are you exuding?"
"700380","701980"," Like, what's the X for now?"
"702240","702780"," Like, what is the?"
"706220","708560"," Oh, yeah."
"708820","712380"," I don't like to tweet like Twitter like birdie going around."
"713640","718810"," No, or X such an insult thing. "
"725810","726610"," Hold on, bra."
"727510","728470"," I'm X and bra."
"730570","731330"," Ta-ta. "
"738630","739390"," Xers unite."
"743560","745040"," It's the X team, bra."
"750190","752850"," Yeah, they looks like they spent a lot of time and money on that, right?"
"753670","754970"," Those like one phone call. "
"756690","759670"," That was like a $5 logo from Fiverr."
"760930","764030"," I bet you got a better logo from Fiverr."
"771570","772830"," What a fucking disaster. "
"773310","773870"," You don't have to wear it."
"774010","777650"," The craziest part is I'm like, do you're going to fucking burn Twitter the ground?"
"777810","780470"," Why not just fucking bankrupt the company and start over with X?"
"781910","783510"," You know, like, I don't understand."
"783850","787830"," I guess the attorneys must have said, I don't know, it wouldn't work or something. "
"787830","788850"," No, they had to because."
"793010","793590"," So bizarre."
"795450","797210"," I don't know the whole thing's bizarre. "
"801740","803700"," I don't know what the fuck is going on with Twitter."
"803820","804600"," Where's the fucking?"
"805340","810000"," Like, I realize, like, look, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a tossable."
"810820","814860"," I know that there's going, I know there's someone out there right now in this, in this chat"
"814860","815900"," somewhere that's going to come up. "
"816100","817560"," It's all part of the group, the master plan."
"819160","823400"," He's going to come back out in two years and it's going to all come together magically."
"824320","826700"," And he's going to come out as the genius again. "
"828180","829820"," But it's a fucking disaster."
"831160","832040"," That's what it is."
"833420","834920"," I don't care how it turns out. "
"835100","836780"," I don't care if they're trading."
"837360","841200"," If there's the largest financial product and I know what it is."
"842100","843400"," I know what's going on. "
"843640","844740"," We talk about it on the show."
"844820","846600"," We've been talking about it for a long period of time."
"848240","849820"," That there's a civil war. "
"850140","851760"," You know, we talk about the Civil War."
"852280","857020"," Any long time watchers here know that we know about the Civil War that's going on."
"860780","862680"," Among social media empires. "
"864140","870460"," You know my take on, you know, one time you had gods, right, then you had."
"873920","875680"," Then you had religion, right, then you had."
"878920","883020"," The democracies and the democracies and the democracies that you had. "
"884940","887540"," Other forms of government like communism, stuff like that."
"887920","890300"," And you had corporations right the rise of the Industrial Revolution."
"891380","893420"," And then you have a corporation starting to run stuff. "
"893640","895440"," Now you've got oligarchs out there running stuff."
"896180","898940"," The rise of corporations, the peak being like Google and stuff."
"898940","903340"," And now you've got the rise of the oligarch in the U.S. too. "
"903980","905520"," You have the rise of the oligarch."
"905940","908800"," As a matter of fact, you just saw what's his face there from China."
"909400","911400"," They ripped him out of being an oligarch, right?"
"911600","912760"," They took him down and I was a teacher. "
"913700","916700"," The U.S. that's going on right now."
"918480","922060"," And there's a war and fight going on for fiefdoms."
"922500","924720"," You've got people in the U.S. giving up their right to vote. "
"925220","927780"," You've got literally people saying, fuck you, I'm not voting."
"927780","933840"," I'm going to go cry and put my vote in on Reddit rather than actually voting."
"934580","942990"," I'm going to believe Reddit's or Elon rather than actually exercising my vote. "
"943910","944970"," It's fucking bizarre."
"945650","947090"," But you're going to trade."
"947270","950210"," You're going to give it away because it doesn't work, which we all know it doesn't work. "
"951070","952250"," But that doesn't mean you're going to give it."
"952290","953010"," You should give it away."
"953110","954670"," That's a more pure insanity. "
"956310","957890"," Rather than take that right back."
"957890","960830"," I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat."
"961730","965170"," You're all giving it up for fucking voting on Twitter and fucking Reddit. "
"966990","967630"," So whatever."
"968030","971350"," But fascinating to see that war go on right now."
"972510","975250"," They want your money and they want you to pay all your bills. "
"975670","981270"," They want you to do all of your services through whatever social media empire it is."
"982070","985630"," The cup that you're going to drink from, the chalice you're going to be a part of."
"985630","988430"," And you're going to have all these fight them's right. "
"990550","995230"," You get plugged in with your goggles and your implants and your."
"997970","998810"," You know, your."
"1000290","1006300"," Your phones will finally be shoved inside your arms and your neck. "
"1007140","1009040"," And you'll become part of the."
"1009760","1012760"," I revolution and eventually the robotics will."
"1013120","1015400"," Come around and we'll have a big war over it, but. "
"1015400","1017220"," It's fucking bizarre to watch."
"1017280","1017820"," It really is."
"1017980","1018920"," You can see it in real time. "
"1019140","1019160"," Right."
"1019280","1019980"," You know where we're going."
"1022900","1023560"," So bears. "
"1027230","1028510"," Not what you want to see."
"1028670","1028810"," Right."
"1031260","1032380"," Most certainly here. "
"1032660","1033940"," Not what a bear wants to see."
"1037440","1038700"," Into yesterday's close."
"1040880","1043140"," Right around four fifteen. "
"1044640","1048660"," There was a war going on in the market."
"1048660","1051920"," I'm assuming at this point it's state street."
"1054550","1058270"," I'm going to assume right now that fish and the fish downgrade. "
"1059530","1060830"," And state street."
"1061170","1063190"," You pretty much have state street, black rock."
"1064350","1065310"," Some banks. "
"1066730","1068730"," Smaller players GS JPM."
"1069670","1071890"," You saw Jamie Diamond coming out and saying."
"1072650","1072910"," Beep. "
"1074730","1077510"," Jamie Diamond saying eat about a deep beep."
"1077750","1077890"," Right."
"1077890","1080630"," And some major players. "
"1080670","1082190"," You saw a car icon."
"1083610","1085030"," Took another hit, right?"
"1085810","1087610"," Probably Bill Ackman's out there."
"1087950","1088670"," Lesser player. "
"1089430","1092670"," Much lesser player than some of these larger institutions."
"1093930","1096110"," And you saw two things."
"1096250","1097110"," Yes, or three things. "
"1097250","1098750"," I want to talk to you guys about three things."
"1100470","1102490"," There was a hammer down moment."
"1103350","1104750"," I'm going to show this right now. "
"1104830","1105890"," Hold on."
"1108040","1109620"," I'm going to switch over to something here."
"1109760","1110120"," Hold on here. "
"1117370","1120190"," Couple interesting moments in the stock market."
"1121250","1121850"," So."
"1123530","1124610"," The other night. "
"1128260","1131060"," You know, oftentimes you'll see people claim."
"1131860","1133500"," We're going to trigger screen right now."
"1134580","1138700"," The other night on ES and the late night and the overnight down here. "
"1141180","1147820"," Now there's there's a thought process here that this action in the overnight was to trigger stops."
"1149420","1150200"," Down here."
"1150960","1152400"," And then down here again. "
"1152420","1153600"," This is actually during the daytime."
"1154560","1156600"," But the key one was right here."
"1158040","1160680"," It actually started right in here, believe it or not. "
"1162060","1164300"," So up in here in the middle of the night on Thursday."
"1165540","1171380"," They were trying to buy it up and market the middle of the night just went boom big black screen."
"1172160","1176820"," Liquidity left the market and major stink stink beds came in down below. "
"1176820","1179720"," We saw the role come down there in the middle of the night."
"1180220","1182140"," And they started slamming this down."
"1183080","1187040"," In the morning right before before cash market RTH and all that kind of stuff. "
"1187540","1191280"," And you saw the pitch downgrade."
"1192080","1197920"," And do they have fucking on I'm telling you on Bloomberg on Fox business on CNBC."
"1200740","1204320"," They have carded out every loser. "
"1206160","1210660"," Like literally like these are like the people that work in the back store room."
"1210880","1215460"," Like bring out Bob from the back store room over here at Main Street and we're going to have this"
"1215460","1216800"," going to roll this guy out and."
"1218040","1220600"," Let him tell you how horrible things are. "
"1220960","1222880"," That article that I showed you yesterday."
"1223700","1225720"," I didn't know that guy worked for Main Street."
"1225940","1226900"," I did but I didn't. "
"1227060","1229020"," Now today it's all coming together for the third day now."
"1229020","1230420"," I'm chewing on this lawn morn."
"1230800","1231040"," I'm like. "
"1231580","1235340"," So you got Main Street out there or State Street out there."
"1235780","1237420"," Trying to sell the market right now."
"1237600","1240440"," You've got other people out there trying to buy the market right where we are. "
"1241800","1243560"," And my to this point."
"1246260","1250700"," To this point we're going to switch back over to the main screen right now."
"1252400","1256660"," To this point you saw this at around two o'clock in the morning on Thursday. "
"1257620","1261920"," Saw it again around four a.m. and then yesterday."
"1263840","1266100"," You saw some real hard core."
"1267400","1271820"," Selling here or not selling but resistance to going up. "
"1272320","1274560"," Now I realize they got to sell puts to you guys."
"1274560","1277360"," I know they're going to have to sell you puts and if they unload all these puts."
"1278180","1282000"," As many as they possibly can wherever they can anyone overly bearish. "
"1283540","1284740"," Do it again in here."
"1284740","1286200"," Do it again right here."
"1287040","1289880"," And you got Jamie Diamond out there from JPM going. "
"1291880","1293180"," No we're buying this shit."
"1293280","1294380"," We're not going down right now."
"1294380","1296700"," And even if we are going down we're going to go back up so we can. "
"1297480","1298500"," Exit the market before."
"1299960","1303580"," We start heavily selling right everybody's got orderly manner sell the market."
"1304180","1305400"," Which is actually going to take some time. "
"1305480","1306120"," We're going to go back up."
"1306320","1307340"," We're going to do all this other stuff."
"1307920","1310120"," Trying to get all time highs and get the fuck on out of here at some point. "
"1310120","1314420"," By fall and then we'll have a big roll over in the late winter."
"1315280","1316100"," It's never right."
"1318480","1321860"," But it is fascinating to watch these larger players out there. "
"1322760","1325780"," And what they're actually trying to do what their motivations are."
"1326960","1330200"," Then of course chasing yield and all that kind of stuff."
"1332560","1334060"," Who's trying to chase that yield. "
"1334880","1337520"," Who wants that yield and needs that yield or needs to get out from that yield."
"1338700","1340520"," So they can make some money right not blow up."
"1340520","1341760"," I am fascinated here. "
"1343160","1344120"," For two years."
"1345020","1347300"," For two years I've been trying to figure out."
"1350450","1357570"," If we do have a market implodes moments or a real fraudulent moment in the market where something"
"1357570","1358130"," implodes. "
"1358630","1360310"," We were like, is it going to be the banks?"
"1360510","1363230"," Is it going to be the auto industry?"
"1363950","1365570"," The housing industry looks okay still."
"1367130","1369470"," From what I'm looking at."
"1369470","1371730"," Before I talk to you guys about this more. "
"1371930","1373630"," I am collecting this stuff in the background."
"1373890","1375110"," But if I had to guess."
"1376450","1379350"," It's going to be one of these companies. "
"1379670","1381670"," It's going to be like a state street or a."
"1382750","1384270"," Bill Lackman type or."
"1385090","1388090"," Carl Eichen type or to me one of these large."
"1388370","1389990"," It's a black rock or something. "
"1391870","1393070"," They say black rocks."
"1393410","1395570"," Black rock and fucking state street have like."
"1395570","1399450"," The third and fourth largest GDP of the entire world. "
"1400110","1404030"," Behind the only the US and China I saw that was brought up treated or something like that."
"1406150","1408610"," So I'm assuming that someone's getting crushed."
"1408810","1410710"," I'm assuming that someone's getting hammered. "
"1411690","1413150"," Probably in the bond market somewhere."
"1414290","1417310"," And it's going to come back to on to some point."
"1418030","1423670"," And the two big to fail type moments right might include some or might be involved in something"
"1423670","1424190"," like that. "
"1424190","1425970"," But this market's gone up."
"1426170","1427730"," But the bond market's gotten destroyed."
"1429170","1431030"," And someone got caught up in it. "
"1432030","1433850"," So we'll talk more about that later."
"1434050","1436950"," We've got more work to do on that on that topic."
"1437150","1438870"," If there was that moment that would be it. "
"1439270","1443730"," So at this point right now on Friday there's two things to I want you to be aware."
"1444890","1446270"," So bull or a few things."
"1446630","1448830"," So bulls have reclaimed. "
"1449690","1453490"," And are testing still kind of testing the hourly trigger right now."
"1453490","1453730"," Okay."
"1455350","1459130"," So we've had we had the pullback but not. "
"1460810","1461850"," Not a."
"1465330","1467010"," A correction yet."
"1467270","1468430"," We've had a pullback but not a correction."
"1470930","1475290"," The bulls have regained retake and regained the hourly trigger as of right now. "
"1475790","1476430"," Okay."
"1477190","1480850"," And they're confirming this hourly trigger right now for an upside move."
"1482110","1483470"," Now today's Friday. "
"1483870","1484090"," Right."
"1485450","1489550"," This upside move from here cannot be short-lived."
"1489810","1492030"," Fools are not out of the woods here by any stretch. "
"1492970","1494370"," We're going to talk about that right now."
"1494770","1496410"," We're going to switch over to something here."
"1499180","1500260"," We're going to go to a full. "
"1500640","1501580"," A full screener."
"1501740","1502480"," Full screener here."
"1503680","1504340"," Let's see right. "
"1504600","1505080"," We put that back."
"1505240","1505560"," Wait a minute."
"1505740","1507320"," Where's my my picture here?"
"1508380","1509500"," Got to put my mug up there. "
"1510840","1512200"," Don't know where my picture is."
"1512600","1512860"," All right."
"1513020","1513480"," Fuck my picture. "
"1513640","1514140"," You don't even picture."
"1514140","1515220"," I still haven't fixed that."
"1515300","1515460"," I guess. "
"1517500","1519220"," Let me close that right there."
"1519980","1522200"," So bear with me here."
"1523480","1528800"," What I want to show you on this here is this looks great, right?"
"1529100","1529540"," You're a bull. "
"1531930","1536470"," If you're a bull, you want to be trading this zone here right here."
"1539120","1544340"," If you're a bull, you want to reclaim this and trade this."
"1546380","1551420"," If you're a fan of gang, you're probably like, we're going to be inside here for a little while,"
"1551560","1551780"," baby. "
"1552420","1561820"," I can slap on a nice wide fly here and let these bulls and bears duke it out as the"
"1561820","1568300"," bulls attempt to trade the JPM caller."
"1571670","1574970"," Now there's landmines here for bulls."
"1575950","1577690"," You got some landmines here. "
"1580170","1580910"," Today's Friday."
"1582410","1584170"," It would never shock me to see."
"1585570","1587470"," Hey, yeah, we're going to go up there. "
"1587630","1588790"," We're going to start trading up here."
"1588990","1590030"," We're going here."
"1590570","1592450"," They roll you down on Monday over here. "
"1594050","1596710"," This is the bull trap trade."
"1597010","1598610"," Be wary of this."
"1600410","1603470"," Absolute bull trap trade here in the next week. "
"1603470","1605110"," Mark my words on this."
"1608750","1611810"," I want to express something to you."
"1612490","1620350"," Bulls are not out of the weeds until they come back and get a new high. "
"1621110","1622430"," I don't care if it fails."
"1624270","1630010"," Bulls just need that new high even if it rolls back down down here and we actually then do the"
"1630010","1630510"," consolidation."
"1631330","1634310"," Then we actually go up and attack the JPM caller. "
"1635290","1637670"," Now if it comes up in here and holds, that's fine."
"1638130","1639430"," We'll take that trade up there."
"1641410","1642570"," You know what I'm saying though?"
"1642930","1643390"," I want you to be. "
"1643670","1643970"," I want you to."
"1644050","1647830"," There's a very important message to you if you're a bull."
"1648990","1650890"," It's not good enough that we come up here. "
"1652030","1656810"," You have to get a new high even if it rolls down."
"1657090","1657730"," You have to."
"1657730","1658830"," That's you must. "
"1660130","1663530"," You cannot fail in here for a new high."
"1663710","1664690"," You cannot fail here."
"1665270","1666430"," You cannot fail here. "
"1666710","1667750"," You cannot fail here."
"1668170","1669590"," I'm assuring you of something."
"1670230","1674630"," If at any point you fail in this zone right here. "
"1676490","1680330"," Any point you fail right here to do this."
"1681030","1683490"," I don't care if it's today, tomorrow, Monday, Wednesday of next week."
"1684390","1685830"," We will roll this shit down. "
"1685830","1688630"," And this will be your."
"1688850","1692010"," This will be your exit for the correction right here."
"1692370","1695930"," Because we will correct. "
"1696290","1700730"," And even if we're going to still go back and get all time highs, you'll get stuck in your"
"1700730","1701330"," positioning."
"1702710","1704370"," For at least a month to two months."
"1705250","1707270"," At least one month, let's say, let's call it. "
"1709150","1711570"," Until it recovers to come back up on high again."
"1711570","1715230"," It's a very important part of the mechanics of how the market works right now."
"1715970","1717230"," Is knowing where you are. "
"1718110","1719790"," Knowing what needs to be done."
"1721310","1723070"," And if it fails to happen."
"1724010","1729630"," To either exit the market or be willing to stay long for a longer period of time. "
"1730270","1733090"," One, two months, something like that, possibly even three."
"1733770","1736090"," If it ever turned into this is the top."
"1736710","1739530"," You might be waiting three months before you can get out in your positioning. "
"1740090","1744870"," Another thing you want to be watching right now is if we catch the bid here on our way up."
"1747010","1749230"," You want to be paying attention to spec growth."
"1751310","1755610"," And make sure that we're not cycling out of spec growth, even if we're going higher. "
"1755870","1761710"," Because that can also be a leading indicator of the topping of the market in the coming months."
"1762750","1764130"," So just be aware of it."
"1764130","1770510"," This is a moving this is a complicated moving beast or pig. "
"1771270","1775830"," As time moves on and as we head into late market topping patterns."
"1776130","1780710"," You want to be paying attention to the rotations in the background."
"1780730","1783410"," I don't know if this is too complicated for some of you out there. "
"1783990","1785610"," But as we come up here."
"1786930","1790530"," You're also going to see people try to exit and consolidate."
"1791210","1792750"," And this includes myself. "
"1792750","1795050"," I need you to know this right now."
"1795170","1795870"," We talked about it."
"1795990","1802250"," I believe last Friday at four p.m. Or possibly Sunday in the private stream. "
"1802950","1803950"," But I'm going to warn you."
"1804530","1805510"," For myself."
"1807590","1808290"," I have. "
"1808730","1812830"," I have too much going on in my investment accounts."
"1813890","1815410"," So as we head up here."
"1817170","1818850"," I am going to be looking. "
"1819990","1821790"," To begin to consolidate."
"1823030","1826690"," What's in my investment account starting to tone it down a little bit."
"1827830","1829530"," Starting to tighten it up a little bit. "
"1829750","1832630"," I started to cut some some not fat but take some gains."
"1832650","1833710"," Take some winnings."
"1834690","1838010"," And you know I'd really mostly because I'm a streamer. "
"1838490","1842350"," But if I wasn't streaming I wouldn't be as I wouldn't be as."
"1842350","1845350"," As like yeah I can't be doing this."
"1845490","1848630"," But for what I'm doing and then what I have to do with this what we do here. "
"1849190","1853090"," I don't have the time to put towards managing."
"1853650","1855830"," My own money believe it or not right now."
"1856290","1861650"," I don't feel confident managing my own money spread out across the stock market right now. "
"1862010","1863570"," So for me personally at some point."
"1864690","1865630"," In the coming."
"1866970","1867410"," Next. "
"1868310","1870070"," Next weeks to month."
"1870490","1873630"," I'm going to be looking to consolidate my exposure to the market."
"1873630","1874550"," So I'm only managing. "
"1876090","1877170"," You know like maybe some."
"1877330","1878250"," I like that."
"1878350","1878990"," I like that. "
"1879870","1881010"," I like that."
"1881190","1881390"," I like that."
"1881390","1882190"," I like that T."
"1882190","1883070"," I like that. "
"1883530","1883630"," S."
"1883730","1883810"," P."
"1883870","1884090"," Y."
"1886210","1889710"," And I want to be I'm going to start taking a peak to see if."
"1894650","1898450"," You can actually see easily see the indexes go higher."
"1899210","1903750"," And watch them start to cut spec growth usually in the end of year December. "
"1904710","1905830"," Christmas January."
"1906910","1908730"," You'll see it CNBC will come out."
"1909190","1913250"," You know one of the signs on spec growth starting to get cut is when you start to see. "
"1914310","1918390"," Kathy will I like Kathy and I like I like Jim Kramer but you'll see them."
"1919770","1924010"," Come out and tell you there's more more growth in spec growth right."
"1924530","1925170"," You'll see. "
"1925490","1925810"," Hey buddy."
"1926750","1929670"," You'll see all the you'll see everybody telling you that."
"1930390","1933270"," There's more to come for spec growth when you start to see that stuff. "
"1933810","1936750"," It'll be time to start exiting when they start telling you."
"1937150","1941050"," To start buying that shit like like a like a like a giant."
"1943350","1948030"," Like a giant like chorus of there's more room in spec growth. "
"1948450","1956190"," So this week or yesterday the old man there Warren Buffett was like by ATT and Verizon or"
"1956190","1956550"," something."
"1957250","1960270"," And I was like he's saying that because it's rolling back over right now."
"1961910","1965390"," But when you see these people come out as a big cacophony. "
"1966370","1970090"," That'll be a nod that we're getting late market late cycle."
"1970970","1977630"," Even if it's only on the intermittent media timeframe like like that late that late winter early"
"1977630","1979050"," 2024 timeframe."
"1979690","1985150"," So to be paid or be conscious of that okay so if you're a bull what do you want to"
"1985150","1985370"," see. "
"1985970","1991010"," You want to see us go back up here right between today tomorrow or to today Monday Tuesday"
"1991010","1991690"," Wednesday."
"1992250","1993710"," It must be nonstop relentless."
"1994410","1997270"," If you see any kind of failure to get up there. "
"1997990","1998870"," Be wary."
"1999470","2004350"," If at any point between now and at least the new high not today but today tomorrow or today Monday"

"3403520","3413380"," as far down as 76.20. But if there's any kind of like pullback, the trade is dead under 76 "
"3413380","3416720",".08. 76.10, let's call it."
"3417460","3422180"," If you have closing bars under 76, let's call it just $76 flat."
"3423000","3429830"," If you have any closing bars under there, the trade is dead to the upside on crude. "
"3432910","3434370"," I don't know why it's not showing here."
"3434490","3434690"," Hold on."
"3437730","3438790"," Here we go. "
"3439050","3441150"," Let me switch over to a different chart here."
"3449400","3451900"," So here are your price targets right here."
"3453720","3463660"," And trade would be dead with closing bars below 76.14. So if you want"
"3463660","3470540"," to screenshot that for yourself, I'd be trying to buy any kind of this yellow box is a measured"
"3470540","3472500"," move from here to the upside. "
"3472780","3474880"," I haven't tried to measure all this here yet."
"3475420","3481120"," If you really want to get crazy with the measured move, if you really want to start getting crazy"
"3481120","3484360"," with measured moves, you're looking at even much higher highs."
"3485080","3488220"," You're looking for going right back up here to trade 122. "
"3488860","3495880"," But I don't think that happens until until September, October, something like that."
"3499770","3504910"," This doesn't look good for spy, does it?"
"3505770","3507510"," For the regular market."
"3507770","3510970"," If this happens, it doesn't look good for spy. "
"3511650","3515750"," So it's kind of counter to pay is this the top or not."
"3517370","3518890"," So the trade is dead."
"3521310","3525470"," Below this 76.14 on lights we crude. "
"3531240","3535400"," But I never took the I never took the little trade."
"3535700","3536460"," I should have and I didn't."
"3554620","3556440"," So if you're in that trade, congratulations. "
"3584910","3587850"," Five minutes cooling off right now on spoos."
"3591470","3595610"," Hourly triggers just getting started to the upside on spoos, just heads up."
"3595770","3598610"," So a little bit of pullback on the five down here. "
"3600530","3608400"," And just a little bit of cooling off here somewhere down here."
"3617820","3619220"," I'd like to buy this down here."
"3620840","3630850"," Take that five minute really quick somewhere down"
"3630850","3631070"," here. "
"3631690","3633070"," Five minute defendant just fine."
"3633190","3634270"," It's a five minute chart right now."
"3635030","3636590"," That was that green bar down there. "
"3636630","3637890"," That's sexy green barley bot."
"3638230","3639230"," Took it all the way up here."
"3639510","3642830"," It stopped out trading the six minute right now. "
"3642870","3645450"," So we'll see if we can grab this six on the way up here again."
"3647620","3650140"," Let me check something really quick here."
"3654590","3655830"," It's about to explode to the upside. "
"3658370","3660090"," I'm gonna miss this train."
"3669040","3669820"," I think and I want to miss it."
"3670020","3670720"," It's gonna start squeezing. "
"3679580","3681000"," We're about to squeeze here."
"3683690","3684150"," That's some good."
"3704370","3706290"," I was thinking that I was ball. "
"3706870","3708230"," I just I just re-entered."
"3708330","3708990"," I'm long again."
"3709230","3710890"," So I'm still up right now. "
"3710970","3712510"," So I'm long again."
"3720000","3720960"," I'm back."
"3720960","3721760"," I'm back in again. "
"3727720","3728740"," I'm back in again."
"3741720","3743400"," I own cues crushing it, man."
"3743680","3744980"," They were crushing it yesterday, too. "
"3746620","3749420"," I went through my entire portfolio yesterday."
"3751080","3752400"," I own cues doing great."
"3753740","3757020"," I'm pissed off right now at a couple of takers, but that's okay. "
"3758220","3763000"," Most of my stuff from the investment account or the investment portfolio is up a lot."
"3763780","3766460"," Even with the pullbacks, I'm still up significantly."
"3768040","3776260"," My some of my likes, not that's safety trades, but I want some exposure to. "
"3778640","3781600"," It's like I was talking to Joe yesterday about this."
"3781980","3786020"," We were having a conversation after the market closed yesterday and."
"3787400","3788520"," We were discussing. "
"3790320","3791460"," Managing emotions."
"3793080","3793620"," And."
"3794860","3799160"," Hey, if the market rolls over here significantly, how long do I have to expose. "
"3800540","3802240"," Do I have to stay."
"3802960","3806440"," Do I like, so right now I'm looking for like."
"3806960","3808760"," I want to have a banner year. "
"3809440","3811180"," And if we roll down."
"3812500","3815280"," And I have to stay long and some of this shit."
"3816120","3818000"," For in waste two months. "
"3819500","3822700"," I won't have a banner year of a good year, but I don't have a banner year."
"3824140","3826660"," I don't know if you understand what I'm saying here, but."
"3831590","3832550"," It'll be a good year. "
"3832870","3835090"," It won't be what I'm expecting this year to be."
"3835610","3835810"," So."
"3836890","3838810"," The question becomes, do you cut. "
"3840940","3844700"," So I can put that money to work somewhere else for the next month."
"3848550","3848890"," The."
"3857860","3858880"," Do you stay the course?"
"3862720","3864860"," And of course, you're not you. "
"3864980","3865280"," I'm scared."
"3866620","3870420"," I mean, I have some real emotions running right now in the background in this."
"3877040","3880100"," But you have to beat the S&P 500. "
"3880700","3880880"," So."
"3882540","3886120"," I do a blend of like, so if we're in a bull run or a bull market, now this is"
"3886120","3889160"," a conversation going back to October, December, March, May."
"3890620","3891820"," If we're in a bull run. "
"3893280","3895480"," You want to is odd."
"3895620","3898840"," I had someone say, well, all of your tickers are up."
"3899700","3900660"," Twelve, it's conversation. "
"3901240","3905320"," So someone said, all of your tickers are up because the entire market is up."
"3906080","3914600"," And I kind of giggled and laughed about that because the the black box that I use for these picks"
"3914600","3916760"," on these tickers."
"3917380","3925900"," The intent behind it is when the stock market is going down, these tickers are going up. "
"3927760","3930680"," So as we were going down, so let's start at the beginning."
"3931060","3931140"," So."
"3932140","3934200"," This black box, I was using it. "
"3936360","3940740"," Two years, three years ago, I think, three years ago, four years ago."
"3942300","3946560"," And while the market would be going down, it would be it would be popping out."
"3947720","3949280"," Pickers that are high risk. "
"3949940","3951740"," But they're going up on the markets going down."
"3952540","3954840"," As we went into a risk off environment."
"3957280","3959200"," In December, 2020. "
"3959920","3961500"," And more specifically."
"3963140","3965100"," In in glaringly."
"3965920","3969260"," Into the side November, December of 2022. "
"3969880","3973120"," It just stopped spitting out tickers."
"3974280","3977800"," And it went like for and then I started doing it for weeks and then months."
"3978500","3980740"," Where it didn't give me a single ticker. "
"3980740","3982900"," For the bull black box."
"3984780","3989220"," So it was telling me, hey, man, there is we're in a risk off environment."
"3990240","3992440"," And they're not buying anything. "
"3992940","3994200"," Nothing in spec growth."
"3995380","4000540"," Now this black box spits out tickers that have awesome fundamentals."
"4003440","4005380"," Awesome potential for growth. "
"4006020","4009360"," Awesome products that they real products that they sell."
"4009360","4013640"," With real revs and real profit."
"4014200","4016380"," And they don't owe any money to anybody. "
"4016960","4019240"," And they're being bought while the market is going down."
"4019560","4021640"," So all of these layers."
"4023560","4024860"," In these companies. "
"4027440","4029040"," Fit fit a."
"4031800","4032800"," Fit a."
"4033440","4034460"," They fit a."
"4034460","4040400"," The reason why we're picking these is because we're trying to outperform the S&P 500."
"4041380","4046600"," And we're also picking these so we don't wake up one morning and they've gone to zero."
"4049410","4053390"," And they are outperforming the S&P 500. "
"4053890","4055350"," Now saying all that."
"4056430","4058070"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"4059590","4062330"," I also have a blend of, hey, I'm going to go by Verizon. "
"4062330","4064010"," I'm going to go by PayPal."
"4064370","4065190"," I'm going to go by Starbucks."
"4065750","4071530"," And I'm going to go by Tyson Foods and all these other tickers that aren't those companies, are"
"4071530","4071690"," they?"
"4071870","4075090"," They're not going to all outperform the S&P 500. "
"4075690","4077630"," Some of them might outperform the S&P 500."
"4077890","4080450"," Some of them might perform with the S&P 500."
"4081730","4082470"," And some of them are not. "
"4082650","4084470"," And I'm noticing it right now in those picks."
"4085590","4088850"," For my own portfolio that some of them are doing okay."
"4089590","4091430"," Some of them are, some of them are kind of. "
"4092350","4093390"," Yeah, they're okay."
"4094630","4095569"," They're not great."
"4096550","4096950"," So. "
"4099470","4102109"," I'm a little disappointed in some of those tickers."
"4102330","4103689"," Like I'm disappointed right now."
"4103990","4106970"," I should have, I knew that the first, like as a matter of fact, Verizon. "
"4107710","4108569"," Or no, ATT."
"4108910","4111430"," I was like, I know this is a get in and get out trade."
"4112250","4113350"," Starting a role right now. "
"4113950","4116510"," I didn't, I didn't, like we have this shit."
"4116630","4117330"," Should I bottom there?"
"4117330","4119050"," I got to listen to you guys in the chat."
"4120670","4121310"," It's okay. "
"4121470","4122090"," Don't worry about it."
"4122770","4124410"," I want to add in down here, believe it."
"4124510","4125590"," That's why I drew that yellow box. "
"4125930","4127010"," I want to buy something down here."
"4127850","4128950"," We can add this who will."
"4129729","4129830"," So. "
"4134359","4140200"," Try to explain the investor, my mindset or my, my investor mindset here."
"4140779","4145580"," So like an example would be, let's look at AT&T."
"4148100","4149580"," Oh, this is a good one to look at. "
"4151140","4153279"," So this one frustrates me to no end."
"4157689","4159270"," Frustrating me to no end."
"4160850","4164149"," So AT&T, we actually called this one out. "
"4166399","4167880"," We called this one out on Twitter."
"4169760","4175029"," And I knew when I bought this."
"4176390","4177830"," I talked about it here in stream two. "
"4178649","4183050"," I knew that this was only a short term trade and it rolled."
"4183170","4184050"," It failed up here."
"4184450","4186490"," I knew that would happen there. "
"4186729","4187490"," Didn't cut them."
"4188109","4192229"," Now I'm hoping if we've actually got there and closed this out up here."
"4193930","4195490"," And at least close this. "
"4196030","4200170"," Now what I really want to do is I want to own a TT for three years."
"4202250","4204830"," I know I should own it for three years."
"4204830","4206650"," One to three years, but I'm a day trader. "
"4206890","4210090"," So I want to see all this get closed up here."
"4212160","4212940"," It's $20."
"4213300","4213940"," All this stuff. "
"4214440","4216780"," I want to see all this get closed up here."
"4216900","4220800"," I want to see this giant gap get closed up here at $24."
"4221220","4221860"," All this stuff. "
"4222080","4227720"," Am I patient enough to hold this that long before the bull run is over?"
"4228000","4228820"," I don't know."
"4230880","4233620"," Are we done here with AT&T?"
"4233700","4234280"," I don't know."
"4235660","4238120"," I want to give it to my kids. "
"4238520","4239980"," I just want to have it in my portfolio."
"4241120","4243540"," So I'm kind of like disappointed here with this stuff."
"4243580","4245100"," It's dragging my portfolio down. "
"4246060","4247100"," Do I leave it on?"
"4248760","4250280"," My comfortable where I am?"
"4250940","4252480"," Is it not done going down?"
"4252960","4255740"," Right now it's saying it's not done going down in a four hour."
"4255840","4256720"," See the white and the red?"
"4258120","4263230"," Maybe new lows ahead for AT&T."
"4263230","4270290"," So I'm not happy right now with AT&T. "
"4279490","4281330"," Not happy right now with AT&T."
"4281430","4286190"," So Biden is expected to issue his long-awaited executive order to screen outbound investments in"
"4286190","4290970"," sensitive technologies to China early next week, according to people familiar with the matter."
"4291590","4293690"," White House spokesperson, however, has declined to comment. "
"4298480","4301260"," And I'm questioning my judgment."
"4302420","4305720"," I'm questioning a few things and questions."
"4306080","4307700"," The stream is sponsored by Ticksright. "
"4307940","4308920"," Am I doing too much?"
"4308920","4310480"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear orders."
"4311180","4312480"," Exposing myself too much."
"4312700","4314020"," Am I not able to manage this?"
"4314860","4315780"," Ticksright.com."
"4316060","4321380"," Am I not putting limit cells or I should be putting limit cells on the upside?"
"4321880","4322820"," Or the downside?"
"4323220","4326760"," Well, it actually just puts them on the downside on that specific ticker. "
"4327180","4329120"," I never put anything to take the money and run on the upside."
"4329120","4331920"," I should have disappointed in myself."
"4332060","4333920"," I'm like my own worst critic here. "
"4334760","4338560"," When I don't do something right and I know I should have taken the money and run."
"4339240","4341140"," And I wasn't paying attention."
"4341700","4342960"," I see those kind of things. "
"4343200","4345240"," I'm like, yeah, I'm being kind of fucking sloppy here."
"4346780","4348340"," So I'm not happy with myself."
"4348780","4350460"," I'm not happy with my own management. "
"4353360","4356460"," And but then I'm also just I'm also debating myself."
"4357220","4361680"," Why am I adding AT&T and saying I'm going to hold it for one to three years."
"4363320","4364820"," And now second guessing myself. "
"4365500","4366880"," Is there more downside to come?"
"4369880","4371960"," If ultimately I think it could go lower."
"4374140","4376180"," And I don't believe I'll be honest with you out there."
"4376500","4379860"," I don't believe they're ever going to be on the hook for. "
"4380780","4383000"," Those buried lines in the ground."
"4383400","4385040"," I don't think they're ever going to be on the hook for that."
"4385040","4388980"," So I don't think their exposure is as bad as you might think that it is. "
"4389180","4391720"," You might have a fantasy that it is."
"4392340","4395260"," But I think it's highly unlikely that it actually happens."
"4395800","4395920"," So. "
"4398400","4399420"," I don't know."
"4400460","4401980"," There's a lot of stuff that you go through."
"4404620","4406580"," You know, of course we bounced today on. "
"4406740","4409360"," So this morning we bounced on spy and I'm like."
"4410140","4413020"," That, of course, my emotions changed again today."
"4413020","4418720"," My emotions today were like, we're safe again for moments. "
"4422740","4427100"," But I personally haven't had a moment this entire year where I've been like, maybe it's time to"
"4427100","4427980"," start consolidating."
"4428400","4431580"," So I guess if I'm thinking that I can't be the only one thinking that."
"4431900","4433800"," I don't think that I would be the only one thinking that. "
"4434020","4437800"," So let me know what you think in the chat."
"4437960","4439320"," Do I sound crazy to you?"
"4439420","4439740"," I don't know."
"4453600","4454640"," Yeah, I'm long right now. "
"4455440","4456420"," I'm still long right now."
"4459670","4461830"," Whoever said that in the chat, I'm like, yeah, you know what?"
"4461910","4462110"," You're right."
"4462270","4464190"," I'll just hold these fucking things to the fucking bell. "
"4464630","4466430"," I'll time and hand these things to the end of the day."
"4466450","4466850"," How about that?"
"4466950","4467930"," Or at least until we go up there."
"4468890","4470350"," We can slap this R2. "
"4471350","4472250"," I'll sell them there."
"4472730","4474550"," I'll try to reenter for R3 up here."
"4475350","4475670"," So. "
"4488180","4490120"," Yeah, this is another thing that I haven't done either."
"4492280","4495300"," There's another thing that I haven't done either is I haven't taken the time to sell puts."
"4496260","4497760"," I'm kind of pissed off at that too. "
"4497760","4499480"," I haven't sold any calls."
"4499480","4500720"," I haven't done any of that stuff."
"4501940","4506100"," Just no time like literally no time to manage my holdings. "
"4506740","4512120"," So I haven't had any time to do what I would say or what I normally would normally do."
"4512660","4517560"," When I was in a bull market where we were in up until December of 2021."
"4518520","4524420"," I had much better management of much much better management of my holdings. "
"4524420","4530780"," And now that I'm streaming, I don't have that time available like I used to."
"4530940","4538180"," I used to spend a lot of time staring at my accounts, managing my accounts, focused on my accounts."
"4538600","4540460"," And I haven't been doing that like I should. "
"4540880","4542300"," So it's like full disclosure."
"4552980","4554500"," Yeah, it's definitely full disclosure."
"4554860","4556000"," My holdings by the way. "
"4556480","4557860"," I do like you know, it's really crazy."
"4558260","4560420"," Like I cut or cut PayPal the other day."
"4560920","4562500"," And I did not cut Starbucks. "
"4562500","4565980"," And I want to fucking sell Starbucks right fucking now."
"4567660","4570080"," Like 100% want to sell Starbucks right now."
"4599460","4600340"," Late to the game. "
"4601060","4601640"," So expecting Apple."
"4601840","4604240"," Yeah, we had a great Apple move on the opening bell this morning."
"4604640","4606420"," You want to trade some Apple real quick?"
"4606600","4606800"," Hold on. "
"4609200","4610760"," Yeah, let's look at Apple real quick."
"4613540","4614780"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"4615080","4616080"," Do you think Apple is. "
"4616400","4618000"," Let's ask a question of the chat."
"4618300","4620140"," Do you guys think that Apple is done?"
"4623180","4625140"," I have mixed feelings here in Apple."
"4625140","4629920"," Oh, so Tim Apple did come out and say something yesterday. "
"4630120","4633320"," I noticed that that he was like."
"4634880","4638480"," Correct me if I'm wrong, but he did come out yesterday and give guidance and say."
"4639460","4645300"," We don't like to talk about stuff like artificial intelligence until we have an event. "
"4646980","4648140"," Something like that."
"4653130","4655110"," So that was kind of hilarious."
"4655110","4658470"," I read that I read that this morning as a blurb or something. "
"4660270","4665230"," And we all I used to be a big Apple trader and you're like, we have to put it in"
"4665230","4665510"," an event."
"4666090","4671830"," And we're actually firing the company right now that we're hunting down the person that that"
"4671830","4672930"," released that information."
"4673630","4676990"," We're going to we're going to murder him in his sleep and make him walk out of a hotel. "
"4678410","4682290"," Window down on elevator shaft with four bullets falling him down in the back of his head."
"4688770","4690890"," They never like when that becomes public, right?"
"4691130","4691650"," Because it's an event."
"4697320","4697760"," Yeah. "
"4702300","4703780"," So let's look at Apple really quick."
"4706370","4709110"," You want to take a squeeze on Apple for a zero date."
"4713940","4714740"," It's weird here. "
"4714880","4715620"," Let's look at them."
"4715860","4716920"," We bring Apple up real quick."
"4718240","4719060"," Bring up what?"
"4722630","4723270"," There we go. "
"4725270","4726910"," This is an Apple one minute chart."
"4730750","4734910"," This is the this is the bounce on Apple."
"4735510","4736850"," Dude, what my camera's back. "
"4737690","4738070"," Okay."
"4738890","4739330"," Whatever."
"4739710","4740130"," Camera's back. "
"4745510","4747670"," So we had the downside target, right?"
"4747910","4749950"," We didn't quite I don't know if we quite got the upside target."
"4749990","4750450"," Yeah, we did."
"4750730","4752090"," So we got the upside target up here. "
"4753410","4760070"," And you we yesterday were talking about all you would see profit taking."
"4761630","4763230"," Looks like they took that right."
"4763430","4767830"," They hit the upside target came back down bounced on the downside target. "
"4768730","4771690"," Now rolling over here in the question becomes."
"4773890","4777570"," Is there going to be any zero day trades here on Apple?"
"4777570","4781810"," Are bears going to get further continuation and downside here?"
"4782610","4785270"," More payday for Apple put holders."
"4786710","4789970"," So let's take a look at the Apple at the Apple. "
"4792270","4794710"," I want to say two things here about Apple."
"4795490","4797550"," If you're bearish on Apple."
"4799390","4802030"," It doesn't look bearish to me. "
"4802610","4804870"," There might be a little bit more downside here."
"4805910","4808890"," On Apple, but it doesn't look bearish to me."
"4812850","4814550"," I'm going to show you this chart right here. "
"4814590","4816070"," This is a 30 minute chart on Apple."
"4818570","4822350"," This is the pay we're going down to the weekly down here."
"4822950","4823410"," 175. "
"4826650","4832350"," So your thesis here would have to be that Apple's going to trade 175."
"4836790","4838190"," So this is multi fold."
"4838870","4841790"," You could probably look for a month out. "
"4842550","4846510"," Put in call for 175 and in the money call."
"4846710","4847410"," In the money call."
"4847950","4848650"," Maybe not in the money. "
"4848990","4853990"," I might go out of money calling out of money to put a month out because you're either going one"
"4853990","4855230"," way or the other, right?"
"4856750","4864310"," So you're either going to go down here and trade this 176 which would be a huge move for Apple."
"4864870","4869110"," You also have one, two and three days."
"4869730","4871750"," Apple likes three day trades to the downside. "
"4872130","4873270"," I don't know if you know that or not."
"4873630","4874450"," They like three days."
"4874870","4876890"," I don't know if you count this as a third day up here. "
"4877970","4879490"," One, two and three."
"4880310","4882070"," So this is a down day in Apple."
"4882290","4884910"," This is a down day in Apple and this is a down day in Apple. "
"4886110","4890410"," So let's look at the options chain for Apple into the close right now."
"4891390","4897970"," And we'll also look at the thesis for the S&P 500."
"4898430","4903450"," So the thesis for S&P 500 would be we're going to get a continuation of the downside. "
"4905310","4908110"," You're going to expect the market to roll over after Friday, right?"
"4908630","4914330"," You're going to expect the S&P 500 to fail today and you're going to expect Apple to roll down"
"4914330","4919250"," in the coming week or two and it to start a move to the downside."
"4922760","4927240"," Now, if the S&P 500 is going to go up, we need Apple to come along, right?"
"4927380","4928560"," They don't carry all the weights."
"4929060","4931100"," They do have to go up or at least trade sideways. "
"4932180","4936760"," We can have other we can have we can have Bezos carriers, I guess."
"4940160","4947900"," We can have the Dow Jones industrial average carriers, but Apple's kind of a player here."
"4951000","4958240"," And this is almost if you're a bull out there, you want us you want to buy 175, right?"
"4958420","4964900"," You know that most I want you to know that most bulls are going to want to buy 175 for"
"4964900","4966100"," that AI event. "
"4969220","4970480"," Squeeze and hire right now."
"4972460","4979740"," Target hit on 450, 195 on on spoons."
"4979880","4981000"," I'm going to switch back over real quick. "
"4983880","4989020"," Main screen pin strike right here on 495, 450, 195."
"4991060","4992920"," Try to push it down right now on us."
"4992920","4998600"," Let me take a look at the Apple. "
"4998880","5000640"," The zero dates."
"5000700","5000980"," Hold on."
"5015770","5019970"," So an Apple zero dates for today is August 4th. "
"5023210","5025110"," 187.5 has 104."
"5025730","5026150"," Oh, man."
"5026330","5026970"," What are they doing to me?"
"5027790","5029870"," I fucking hate these bears. "
"5030870","5031710"," No offense bears."
"5031710","5032270"," I love you."
"5035580","5037800"," Look at look at look at this so emotional. "
"5038820","5040600"," God damn bears up here."
"5042890","5044400"," Oh, yeah, emotionally are."
"5044840","5045920"," Oh, violent. "
"5046200","5046800"," They are over here."
"5047060","5047820"," How much rage."
"5050240","5051220"," That rage. "
"5051720","5052920"," So it's so stinky."
"5059880","5063140"," There's someone owns someone bought today."
"5066200","5075440"," 105,187.5 c's for five cents on Apple. "
"5075840","5077580"," Seems like a pretty cheap zero date."
"5077580","5087460"," How often do you see an in the money call for five cents on a zero date for"
"5087460","5087680"," Apple?"
"5087820","5088720"," It's pretty rare, right?"
"5088940","5091060"," Like how often do you get to trade that for five cents?"
"5092360","5100300"," And there's still a fat, fat stack of Apple puts at 185 P."
"5104440","5105460"," Let's look at Apple."
"5107830","5108770"," Here's Apple down here. "
"5112640","5114280"," There's the expected move right there."
"5115360","5118940"," And this is the expected move to the downside right here."
"5120120","5121080"," See it right there. "
"5121220","5121680"," Hold on."
"5122020","5122880"," Five minute chart."
"5124140","5126140"," Here's the expected move on the upside. "
"5126660","5127000"," Tagged it."
"5127180","5128300"," Expected move to the downside."
"5129360","5130860"," Can't really complain about this, right?"
"5131260","5131560"," Shareholders. "
"5133260","5134300"," But holders."
"5134600","5135360"," Yeah, we're getting paid."
"5136440","5138300"," Here's the expected move to the downside. "
"5138300","5147560"," And you've got 105 or 187.75. That seems like a little."
"5151590","5153310"," 175 being the money right here."
"5156820","5158580"," I don't know if I'm down with that trade. "
"5160320","5160800"," Sorry."
"5165260","5167400"," You can see the dip got bought down here."
"5168340","5170000"," Right on that open, you can see it. "
"5170260","5188800"," 183.25. So for Apple, I'll watch"
"5188800","5189740"," this in the background."
"5190880","5192340"," I'll buy some of this with you."
"5193460","5194720"," Starting to squeeze right now. "
"5194940","5197660"," So seeing as some people, 100 leg up, extending gains here."
"5197820","5201200"," Up around 0.7% now and fast move up to the upside."
"5201440","5201840"," Oh, yeah. "
"5201980","5202180"," Look at that."
"5202500","5205300"," Apple's now trading 6 cents, 7 cents on those calls."
"5205700","5207140"," They were 5 cents just a minute ago. "
"5210100","5211840"," I'd like to see Apple trade up."
"5213800","5215800"," And test the one minute right here."
"5220090","5222130"," And begin to attack all this stuff here. "
"5229360","5230700"," So that's a price target up there."
"5283310","5285450"," And you're going to fill this one right here, guaranteed."
"5297820","5302130"," So I'll watch this one in the back. "
"5302250","5303490"," I'm going to keep my eyes on this one."
"5305190","5308330"," I'll show you exactly what I need to see to take this trade."
"5308530","5309550"," I want to see like a."
"5315710","5317610"," To take this trade, I want to see. "
"5322280","5324800"," At least this right here like a break above."
"5326420","5328200"," Failure and start going up."
"5328440","5330340"," If that happens, we'll take the trade right there. "
"5333180","5335480"," And you'd see this continuation up on the upside."
"5336000","5339720"," It might take a while almost into the end of the day to do this trade."
"5340100","5342020"," So with pay attention to it, just keep your eyes on it. "
"5342940","5344920"," See that you see the turn happening already."
"5345920","5346860"," It's already happening."
"5347080","5347840"," So we're almost there. "
"5348060","5349300"," Not quite there, but almost there."
"5350980","5351480"," On Apple."
"5351700","5351940"," It's coming. "
"5352840","5353560"," We're close."
"5354680","5356200"," We could be really close."
"5356400","5356940"," See the curve?"
"5357760","5358700"," You don't see the curve. "
"5358800","5359300"," I'll show you the curves."
"5359440","5359660"," The curve."
"5362820","5364620"," You see that red line, how it's flattening out?"
"5366160","5368020"," It's about to start curving up right there. "
"5368500","5369300"," Almost there."
"5373510","5375690"," I'm not exactly that, but you get the picture."
"5376610","5379910"," I would not hold this into 187.50. I would get out before. "
"5381910","5382570"," That's Apple."
"5385340","5385740"," Good luck."
"5388260","5389980"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"5389980","5391320"," Oh, yeah."
"5392000","5393540"," Oh, yeah."
"5393860","5394280"," Oh, yeah. "
"5394280","5394740"," Oh, yeah."
"5404660","5407920"," It's trading 38 cents right now on spy."
"5414770","5418410"," 38 cents right now on spy. "
"5426300","5427140"," Hang in."

"5443640","5444760"," Did I just take it and run?"
"5451700","5453160"," At the 300% fucking chain."
"5453340","5454040"," Hold on a second here. "
"5455460","5456740"," Oh, it's the last one."
"5456840","5457960"," It's 300 total so far."
"5458160","5458640"," Hold on a second here. "
"5465530","5466730"," Holy shoot."
"5470640","5473240"," It's trading 44 cents right now on 453."
"5474240","5476400"," 43 cents right now on 453. "
"5477140","5489220"," It's trading"
"5489220","5490600"," 45 cents right now."
"5492180","5493420"," I'm going to take the money."
"5493420","5493900"," I'm out of here. "
"5499440","5500120"," I'm flat."

"5501780","5502300"," Fucking good. "
"5504710","5506770"," Give me a pullback so I can fly again."

"6161430","6166090"," Let me rephrase that for you."
"6166430","6168670"," Let me actually chart it out. "
"6174010","6175290"," Here's HPE."
"6177550","6180190"," I'm not bearish here, okay?"
"6182290","6184430"," But I want you to see this, okay?"

"6196230","6197770"," I want to show you something here."
"6198150","6199210"," So this is HPE. "

"6225070","6225790"," Comes back down."
"6225950","6226150"," Look at that. "
"6226230","6228030"," I did the right thing by getting out of that trade, right?"
"6228570","6228710"," Ooh."
"6231940","6233500"," Starts to blast up again up here."
"6235660","6237040"," Take the money and run, right?"
"6238140","6239480"," Same person over here, right?"
"6242600","6244000"," All I want to do is get off the ride. "
"6244100","6245100"," All I want to do is get off the ride."
"6245240","6245800"," Get me off the ride."
"6245960","6246540"," Get me off the ride. "
"6246680","6247440"," Get me off the ride."
"6248120","6251620"," And now you're looking for this big move right here."
"6254640","6255560"," Not HP, right?"
"6256020","6256340"," HPE. "
"6256640","6259480"," So do I think you get the move?"
"6259700","6259780"," Yes."
"6261680","6270460"," What I do know for sure, I'm positive on, is that up here at 20 bucks, there's an algorithm that's"
"6270460","6271140"," going to sell that."
"6271880","6272820"," I know they are. "
"6273360","6279750"," I know they're going to sell 19 to auto cell."
"6281510","6284870"," So this is what I will say to you about HPE."
"6285010","6285930"," Am I bullish on it?"
"6286030","6286210"," Yes. "
"6287890","6289590"," Am I bullish right here on it?"
"6289810","6290070"," Yes."
"6290490","6293190"," Am I bullish on a breakout on it right here?"
"6293410","6293670"," Yes."
"6294610","6295810"," So this is what I'll tell you. "
"6296580","6305570"," On HPE, as long as price stays above the pay attention here, as long as we don't have any closing"
"6305570","6315330"," bars below $17.33. Right now, your next price target is $17.72."
"6316510","6321690"," If you break out above $17.72 and don't pull back."
"6328210","6328910"," Hello there."
"6333800","6335960"," And you stay on trend. "
"6345730","6349190"," By the end of August, you will see $20."
"6350130","6352970"," So right there, you just have to stay on trend."
"6353830","6356730"," Just like, you know, I'm not bearish per se. "
"6364050","6367490"," And there's your, there's your trade right there."
"6368430","6368670"," Cool."
"6369750","6370390"," Just like that. "
"6371950","6373930"," Spy right now is disgusting."
"6374470","6380450"," It's printing 53 cents on 453 C."
"6381870","6383190"," 53 cents right now."
"6383310","6385630"," It is ripping faces off right now. "
"6386830","6388770"," I don't know how you're upside down today."
"6389070","6390450"," I don't know what to say to you today."
"6391150","6395470"," I don't know how you could be upside down on a trade to the upside right now on. "
"6397050","6398390"," Spy right now."
"6399590","6402610"," I don't know how you are down there."
"6403470","6404750"," Oh, there. "
"6406090","6407010"," Oh, there."
"6407450","6420680"," I wonder"
"6420680","6425680"," if they pin spy for like the next two or three hours, then we get the explosive move."
"6426540","6437180"," Spoons squeezing up trading $42.90. The price target smashed through next target above $43.15. Next"
"6437180","6443900"," target above that $4.54.05 on spoons left me behind on this trade. "
"6444900","6450400"," We'll come right back here again and look to enter if it comes back down and even touches me."
"6455940","6456900"," Yeah, link for dinner."
"6457080","6457300"," Thanks. "
"6457300","6458160"," I appreciate it."
"6458160","6459380"," So a couple of things are going to go over here."
"6461480","6468400"," If you are becoming a better trader, if you're not panicking, if you are taking the money and"

"6738880","6740160"," Hold on a second because they did go to Barbie."
"6740900","6741880"," I did sit on the Barbie."
"6742040","6742620"," Hold on a second here. "
"6742760","6743080"," Hold on a second."
"6753640","6755880"," And I have pictures of the kids at Barbie."

"6757340","6757860"," Hold on a second here."
"6758980","6759880"," I forgot all about Barbie."
"6760540","6761940"," So I did take the kids to Barbie. "
"6762860","6764300"," Let me see if I have a picture with me."
"6767020","6768080"," Let me check."
"6769160","6770860"," I'm so far behind right now. "

"6788250","6788410"," What?"
"6788770","6790490"," What's going on?"
"6790490","6794020"," This is weird."
"6797190","6798910"," I don't know what I'm doing here. "
"6800350","6803810"," I took pictures of Barbie."
"6806120","6807000"," I don't know."
"6808900","6811020"," For some reason, I don't have any pictures here at Barbie. "
"6812040","6815820"," Let me see if I can talk to my children and find out where the pictures of Barbie are."
"6816500","6818760"," So I take the kids to a drive-in movie theater."
"6819600","6820620"," And we watched Barbie. "
"6821260","6822500"," And they dressed up in their stuff."
"6823440","6825100"," And I'll tell you about it here in a second, but."
"6828400","6830640"," So with your donations, I took the kids to Barbie. "
"6831360","6832200"," I took them out to eat."
"6832540","6835020"," I took them out to a cool burger joint."
"6835720","6838540"," It was called Ford's Garage. "
"6839860","6840640"," And I took them there."
"6841340","6842920"," And then I got them a bunch of candy."
"6844240","6845900"," And we attempted to drive in movie theater. "
"6846140","6847800"," And they played in the playground in front of the drive-in."
"6848300","6849420"," And all the little girls came out."
"6849740","6852260"," And they played and sang. "
"6852480","6853220"," They actually sang."
"6854260","6855800"," I'm a Barbie girl in the playground."
"6855800","6856480"," It was hilarious. "
"6857740","6860540"," If you want my take on Barbie, it's the same as before."
"6860820","6862260"," If you're a guy, don't watch that shit."
"6863020","6864240"," It's like it'll trigger you as a guy. "
"6864480","6865940"," Just like girls do what they do."
"6866680","6868380"," If they make some happy, let them have at it."
"6868700","6869960"," For me, I was like, that's pure cancer. "
"6870880","6872420"," But I know that I'm a guy."
"6872620","6874780"," So I'm like, it's kind of like a man."
"6874880","6878340"," I'm assuming that's like a woman maybe watching commando or some shit. "
"6878820","6880220"," And she's like, this is stupid."
"6883020","6886020"," So, you know, it's whatever it is, but they had a blast."
"6886840","6887940"," They loved Barbie. "
"6888840","6895640"," And so anyways, I want to say thanks to J Potter 70 for gifting the sub one tier to SS"
"6895640","6899620"," or NSI Monovo STT Voyager."
"6900040","6901540"," I got to talk to the girls right now, man."
"6901680","6902480"," Get some pictures, brother. "
"6903180","6904440"," And I see them and get them inside here."

"7325460","7327840"," Let's talk about what we need for."
"7329700","7330220"," Continuation. "
"7331660","7335220"," No entry for me yet on Apple, but I am watching in the background."
"7335460","7336800"," We are going to look at."
"7338040","7339060"," Spy right here. "
"7346020","7350180"," What do we need for continuation to the upside for spy?"
"7351000","7351920"," It's a great question."
"7355880","7356800"," I'm going to."
"7359080","7359780"," Let me see. "
"7359880","7360900"," I'll try this out for you."
"7361060","7361180"," Ready?"
"7365320","7365700"," Good question."
"7372230","7373750"," Let's talk about that. "
"7375910","7377030"," Very good."
"7377750","7378310"," Question."
"7386700","7388080"," Just a second here. "
"7391080","7391360"," Ajax."
"7392360","7393200"," Thank you for subscribing."
"7393400","7394220"," I appreciate it, brother. "
"7400060","7400740"," I'm getting it."
"7400840","7401060"," I ordered."
"7402140","7404580"," So you know, I don't know if I told you guys this. "
"7404620","7404980"," I ordered."
"7406340","7409860"," 659 rotary oil rigs, 525, 525."
"7411420","7415840"," So I ordered a whole other studio of computers. "
"7420660","7422320"," And I ordered these computers."
"7422720","7424120"," I don't think they've arrived at that."
"7424120","7425740"," They're supposed to arrive yesterday, but they didn't. "
"7427840","7429300"," So I can run another stream."
"7429780","7432580"," So if I'm not here, I'm going to set up a whole another stream so that."
"7434840","7435700"," So that I can. "
"7437500","7438120"," Run streams."
"7438160","7438820"," I'm not available."
"7439180","7439340"," Sorry. "
"7439460","7440940"," Now I got to do a bunch of work using these computers."
"7442400","7443960"," So I got some cool shit coming your way."
"7443960","7447260"," So for right now, I want to show you. "
"7448820","7450340"," I'm going to show you guys some here."
"7453860","7454460"," See here."
"7455920","7457020"," We're looking for. "
"7466920","7469740"," You have a very good question, right?"
"7470980","7472920"," So we were at highs."
"7475120","7477640"," Back on Thursday, open, right?"
"7480500","7482480"," So back here in Thursday, open."
"7482640","7483220"," What do we need. "
"7485260","7486020"," To do."
"7487620","7491860"," So matter of fact, if I think if you're watching right now, well, this is a segment."
"7492620","7494420"," So what do we need to do. "
"7497890","7500010"," For continuation to the upside."
"7502830","7506950"," So we're going to look at this cell point right here."
"7506950","7510070"," Two four fifty four oh seven on spot. "
"7510950","7512210"," We have another one."
"7513730","7514670"," Right there."
"7516090","7518090"," That's a four fifty six twenty three. "
"7522660","7525740"," We have another one right there four fifty seven sixty two."
"7528400","7529660"," Another one right there."
"7533030","7536350"," And you can you can actually see from this chart right here. "
"7537750","7540810"," You can actually see how much ball there is up here."
"7540910","7542510"," The aggressiveness right here, right?"
"7543190","7543750"," Of the sellers."
"7544530","7547110"," You could call these the big sellers up here, right?"
"7547410","7547970"," You could say. "
"7549710","7551430"," That this right here is where."
"7557220","7560720"," The big bad wolf is right there."
"7562540","7563060"," Okay. "
"7563860","7565680"," So what do we need to know."
"7566920","7567360"," Here."
"7567940","7571360"," We need to know that we need to get a new high. "
"7572040","7574180"," I want you to know that we need to get a new high."
"7575240","7577460"," We don't need to hold that new high."
"7577920","7579880"," We just need to get a new high. "
"7580620","7581060"," Okay."
"7582640","7584680"," I also want you to see this down here."
"7584980","7586260"," We draw this box right here. "
"7587060","7610440"," But this is really"
"7610440","7611320"," what I want to show you."
"7611320","7612120"," Yeah, that's right."
"7612360","7613500"," Twelve or twelve, baby. "
"7614040","7614880"," Twelve four twelve."
"7616520","7618700"," No, it's not good enough."
"7620000","7622260"," There's a nice blood coming in the spy right now. "
"7622560","7627080"," So it's not good enough that we save the daily trigger."
"7627360","7627560"," Is it?"
"7628640","7631820"," I do want you to see that the daily trigger is coming up though."
"7631960","7632840"," That's bullish, right?"
"7633100","7633880"," Say yellow coming up. "
"7635300","7636940"," You've got more push here."
"7636940","7639620"," I want you to see this right here."
"7641700","7644020"," See these green bars right here. "
"7644500","7648440"," We still have some more room to go up right here, right?"
"7652490","7653490"," Same thing up here."
"7655650","7659110"," See how we're coming down on bellow on the five minute."
"7661070","7663450"," See how we're getting a roll right now. "
"7668090","7670090"," See how we're getting this roll right now."
"7671630","7673210"," See how we're getting that roll right now."
"7673690","7674870"," On a five minute right here. "
"7675410","7676270"," Where's the five minute?"
"7676710","7677490"," It's right here."
"7678450","7679030"," See it?"
"7679690","7680150"," It's right there."
"7681610","7681890"," Okay. "
"7683670","7684710"," Actually, it's down here."
"7685730","7686570"," Sorry, hold on a second here."
"7686830","7689110"," It's right here. "
"7689270","7689590"," It's wrong."
"7690990","7692010"," It's actually right here."
"7694190","7696010"," To the weakness of the five minute velocity. "
"7696650","7698050"," So right down here would be the place to buy."
"7699430","7700890"," Right down here, believe it or not."
"7702630","7705730"," Sorry, I switched back over back to the trigger screen. "
"7707110","7710270"," So what do we need to do here?"
"7711330","7714410"," We do not need to hold this."
"7715050","7716850"," We just need to tag it and come back down."
"7717870","7719770"," All this consolidation is fine. "
"7721090","7723990"," To eventually trade above the next zone."
"7724890","7731730"," To trade up here for 465 and 465 and 466 up here."
"7733750","7737390"," Here's your JPM collar on SPXs on spy somewhere up in here. "
"7738190","7741190"," So just for right now, we don't need to actually break above."
"7741570","7746870"," We just need to like an algorithm go up here and tag it."
"7748430","7752850"," Then do a nice trade sideways to consolidate it to move higher to build a base. "
"7754410","7755050"," So."
"7758890","7760210"," This is the bull."
"7762030","7764910"," The bull's next job is to go up there and tag. "
"7766710","7767670"," Previous high."
"7772680","7774920"," 459.55. That's your job."
"7777020","7780460"," I will take any of this red zone up here. "
"7780460","7781740"," Any of this I'll take."
"7782380","7785140"," I'll take from 457 to 462."
"7785140","7790220"," To that to that previous high up here at 450. "
"7792480","7793700"," 4963 I think 452."
"7794920","7796660"," I'll take either of those this whole red box."
"7796780","7797780"," I'll take any of that. "
"7799500","7806780"," Now what you're also looking for here is for a successful retest of this green line right here."
"7807880","7809620"," So for right now."
"7810390","7820300"," The trade remains valid as long as we get no closing bars below 450.56."
"7821640","7826260"," 450.56. So this is a message to you where we asked that question earlier. "
"7827560","7838000"," For right now, 450.56. Your first target to the upside is 454.07. 450 "
"7838000","7845320",".407 and the trade is not dead as long as we stay above 450.64. And that will actually raise"
"7845320","7847140"," by the end of the day."
"7848080","7851300"," A 451 and then by Monday, it'll raise to 454."
"7852680","7853640"," We have to stay above that. "
"7855140","7855240"," Number."
"7855620","7857440"," So let's switch over briefly here."
"7859620","7862120"," So let's take a look for today's close. "
"7862620","7865540"," What do we need for today's close?"
"7866180","7867520"," I gave you a target."
"7868520","7872680"," I said 450.407. Where is that?"
"7872780","7873580"," It's right here, right?"
"7874740","7877500"," Snap the line on the trigger screen."
"7877600","7878100"," Do you see it?"
"7878900","7879460"," Right here. "
"7880160","7880820"," See it right here?"
"7881560","7883220"," You want to as a bull."
"7884020","7889380"," Your best thing you could do today would be to close above here."
"7890620","7893040"," That would be, that would be like. "
"7896580","7897180"," So."
"7899700","7901820"," That would be the bullish narrative."
"7912330","7913490"," You want a quick second. "
"7936980","7937880"," So ready."
"7938040","7939520"," I'm going to change this out right here."
"7943100","7945200"," Must stay above. "
"7947200","7947800"," Ready?"
"7948080","7949320"," You can just snapshot this at home."
"7950320","7951900"," Watch this right here."
"7952600","7954480"," You must stay above this right here. "
"7955200","7956600"," For continuation."
"7957880","7959360"," For the bull narrative."
"7959840","7960160"," You ready?"
"7964010","7964800"," Right here. "
"7969170","7973130"," Bulls wants to trade."
"7976550","7979530"," 454.07, I think I said."
"7983630","7984360"," Right there. "
"7986940","7989020"," So what am I looking for today?"
"7989920","7990800"," If I'm a bull."
"7996150","7999490"," I'm looking for this trade right here."
"7999930","8000390"," And it is close. "
"8004110","8004710"," Okay."
"8005770","8007350"," That's what I want to see today."
"8009870","8011250"," That's your best. "
"8011810","8013230"," That's your best narrative."
"8014790","8016850"," If you want to end this day bullish."
"8019350","8022150"," If you want to say we're not fucking done here. "
"8023610","8026190"," Price needs to be up here in the closing bell."
"8026830","8027910"," Better up here."
"8028890","8030790"," But right here I'll take this right here. "
"8033530","8036590"," For bulls to stay alive over the weekend."
"8037090","8037930"," Just stay alive."
"8040850","8042470"," You need to stay above. "
"8043610","8045510"," This four fifty sixty right here."
"8045550","8047330"," Staying alive into Monday."
"8048070","8050130"," My fear into Monday. "
"8053240","8054860"," Let me show you my fear in a Monday."
"8058330","8059730"," I want to show you guys something here."
"8063310","8065070"," I got to warn you of something here. "
"8065470","8067830"," This is where the this is where the trap is for the bulls."
"8067950","8068930"," We'll show you guys something here."
"8070170","8074310"," I want to show you guys something here. "
"8074730","8076750"," So this is the one arm."
"8076910","8077710"," Maybe you can do this on."
"8084740","8086280"," One quick second here. "
"8120390","8121690"," What is that right there?"
"8123470","8125870"," In just one second I got to show you guys some."
"8152010","8160130"," I'm looking back and I'm going back in time here to show you guys something here."
"8176230","8178460"," Surely expecting the results from the federal corporation. "
"8179650","8180550"," Hey tight here."
"8180610","8181250"," Give me one second here."
"8181870","8182870"," I'm going to hard time get. "
"8184530","8185630"," Expressing this to you."
"8186090","8207370"," I'm going to"
"8207370","8208270"," go back in time here."
"8208830","8210450"," Back in time baby. "

"8295200","8295459"," Fair time."
"8295600","8296379"," I'm saying book pitch. "
"8296520","8297020"," On Monday."
"8300260","8301920"," I don't actually see that."
"8302120","8303320"," I don't actually see that book. "
"8306400","8311980"," We could see the bounce down to the daily trigger here."
"8312100","8314600"," But if that holds, I'd actually buy that close right there too."
"8320180","8320920"," What a second here. "
"8326930","8328010"," Right there."
"8332190","8333270"," Almost there."
"8335450","8335809"," There. "
"8339049","8340350"," Definitely don't want to see this."
"8340730","8343030"," Definitely don't want to see this get given up to you."
"8352950","8355170"," Then HYG looks like it wants to. "
"8360309","8362610"," Let me show you HYG really quick."
"8369260","8371000"," This is HYG."
"8372799","8374620"," There's a small gap right up here. "
"8382719","8385660"," Then it's leaving behind a giant gap down here."
"8394720","8396000"," That doesn't look pretty does it."
"8399820","8401220"," Like to slam up and then boom. "
"8403180","8404980"," A bloodbath down right there."
"8406200","8407540"," So that's HYG."
"8409780","8411580"," And that's implying. "
"8421980","8428060"," You know, that implies that implies like the dip by and the failure down here and the close."
"8429180","8430100"," You see that?"
"8431140","8432380"," Get the squeeze up."
"8432980","8434360"," Failure to get our three. "
"8435620","8436740"," And the move down right here."
"8436740","8442060"," That would close all that gapage down here for spoos."
"8472420","8474460"," That's a big move up there, isn't it?"
"8475980","8478720"," A lot of work for bulls up here. "
"8485330","8487050"," A lot of work."
"8487330","8489170"," Kind of do or die for bulls here, isn't it?"
"8489870","8490570"," Oh, yeah."
"8490910","8491690"," You do it down there. "
"8493970","8497330"," 4.53 C's are 23 cents right now."
"8499070","8501190"," You know what HYG is saying?"
"8503450","8507610"," HYG is saying that this dip will be bought and there'll be a failure right here."
"8513800","8515340"," And we're going to retest this today. "
"8515660","8516580"," That's what it's saying at least."
"8517840","8519260"," Possibly retest this today."
"8521590","8523510"," We'll call this a white line. "
"8523790","8524250"," HYG."
"8527330","8529210"," HYG is saying this will likely get bought."
"8529450","8530010"," We'll close the gap. "
"8530310","8532910"," Or we might even not even squeeze up here."
"8533630","8536310"," HYG might just close the gap and then we roll down here."
"8536890","8539010"," We might even get the squeeze off that HYG. "
"8539190","8542890"," Because HYG looks like it's going to either fail to close that gap above."
"8544170","8545050"," That's one of the other."
"8546410","8550870"," So that would be like HYG closes the gap, but it's fine, doesn't follow along. "
"8551750","8556670"," Maybe the fact that it just goes there and then back down here and trades this to the downside."
"8560210","8561750"," So I'm watching HYG right now."
"8567340","8568940"," 43's or 21 cents right now. "
"8569000","8570500"," I'm not on them right now."
"8570860","8572540"," I'm thinking about buying them the mole right here."
"8572760","8575060"," So I'm thinking about buying this. "
"8584570","8592630"," VIX finding a bottom at 14.57 on a one minute chart."
"8599840","8601300"," We might get some weakness down here."
"8601440","8602440"," Watch my cursor right here. "
"8603740","8605580"," Some weakness down here."
"8605580","8605860"," I'm going to buy this before."
"8607940","8609720"," Apple is rolling over right now. "
"8611920","8613100"," I'll start here."
"8615920","8617160"," Or is it dip by there?"
"8617440","8621180"," There was a reversal candle on Apple on the one minute chart."
"8621580","8622820"," Man, I want to buy this so bad. "
"8624200","8625480"," I don't know if I'm rolling over."
"8625800","8627000"," Testing is 27 EMA."
"8629420","8630380"," You know what?"
"8630960","8632080"," I'm going to buy this here. "
"8632860","8633820"," All right."
"8633880","8636300"," I'm going to start on this dangerous trade."
"8637960","8639920"," I'm checking Dixie right here. "
"8640040","8641560"," It's checking if it's 27 EMA."
"8643340","8645200"," I'm not going to go as big this time now."
"8645640","8646940"," Let me just make this smaller. "
"8647720","8649660"," I think I can lose this trade."
"8652810","8659070"," I'm going to start with .5. Pretty cheap right now."
"8659230","8664530"," The only concern here is that there's not a lot of juice left on the puts. "
"8667670","8670850"," NDX is checking if it's 27 EMA and a 5 minute chart right now."
"8672310","8674970"," So this would be a continuation up or down."
"8675310","8676870"," IWM has a little bit more to come down. "
"8678370","8680050"," The check gets 27 EMA."
"8682290","8684810"," VIX is looking bullish here, so that's not helping me out."
"8686170","8689910"," HYG has, let me switch that back to a 5 minute on HYG. "
"8692820","8695720"," Yeah, it just tested it's a 27 EMA too."
"8699720","8703100"," So for that bullish context, man, we need to see this thing hold."
"8703760","8706280"," If you're a bull, you need to see Nasdaq hold here. "
"8707900","8709260"," This is the place right here."
"8712140","8714780"," I've got my trigger finger on .453 C."
"8715260","8716720"," They're 22 cents right now."
"8718400","8722060"," Maybe I can get like a quick pit pit relation bar down and then back up. "
"8722280","8722580"," I don't know."
"8724520","8726020"," I'm watching this right here right now."
"8728070","8730350"," Do you know what the bear setup here is if it happens?"
"8731450","8734930"," You know what the white and red line looks like if it does roll down. "
"8735930","8737850"," We know the must stay above is right here."
"8739110","8744390"," We know that bulls want to stay above or we know bulls want to close, want to trade this by"
"8744390","8744930"," end of day."
"8748570","8750750"," Is this just a relief rally for the bears?"
"8754860","8756460"," Testing the 27 EMA right now. "
"8756720","8759540"," I'm kind of bullish here, so I'm not on the bear side on this one."
"8762520","8764860"," 43 is a 21 cents right now."
"8765840","8767540"," I'm looking for a cheap entry here. "
"8778750","8780150"," Bring this over and take a peek."
"8780970","8783730"," I definitely do not want to see this break here."
"8783790","8784190"," You see that?"
"8784370","8786250"," You got that orange line right here?"
"8786470","8788310"," Definitely don't want to see a rug pull right there. "
"8789690","8790590"," See right there?"
"8793260","8794800"," Look at that trying to rug pull it right now."
"8794840","8795500"," You see that shit?"

"8805310","8806810"," Look at that rug pull right there."
"8806810","8811100"," Look at that rug pull right there."
"8811900","8814060"," Now that is where shit gets cheap. "
"8820240","8822320"," 4.53s are now 14 cents."
"8823580","8825080"," Oh, man, that looks so good."
"8825280","8825680"," So juicy. "
"8828160","8830560"," 4.52s are 43 cents."
"8833230","8833890"," So juicy."
"8835530","8841870"," There's now 300,000 puts on 4.50Ps. So juicy right there. "
"8848170","8848830"," Now is that trainable?"
"8848970","8850810"," It's 27 EMA in a five minute chart right now."
"8851470","8852450"," IWM is testing."
"8853810","8855670"," It's 27 EMA right now. "
"8857330","8859510"," Thank God I didn't buy any calls right there."
"8860410","8861350"," I would have gotten wrecked."
"8861590","8864370"," I would have given back all my money today if I bought calls right there. "
"8866030","8867370"," Trade in 4.51, 44."
"8867870","8870870"," Should pull back up here and trade 4.51, 86 here in just a moment."
"8879580","8881240"," NDX looking sloppy right now. "
"8884380","8885580"," Vic's trying to trade."
"8886640","8888460"," You don't want to buy this so bad, dude."
"8888460","8889900"," It's so fucking bad. "
"8890000","8890600"," I want to buy this."
"8892040","8893500"," Vic's looking pretty bullish here."

"9028080","9028660"," right there. "
"9028660","9030200"," And a yellow bar right here."
"9038120","9039600"," It looks prettier."
"9048340","9059560"," I didn't have"
"9059560","9061500"," him still testing his 27 EMA. "
"9062240","9063760"," Vic's turning bullish right now."
"9068320","9069120"," There we go, Potty."
"9075220","9076520"," Let me take a look here. "
"9091390","9092850"," It looks like it wants to come back down."
"9095110","9095770"," Price target."

"9099950","9101110"," 450-60 on spoos."
"9101110","9105530"," The thing that wants to test it, it's hourly right now."
"9105750","9107050"," I'm looking somewhere else right now. "
"9109250","9111210"," It looks like it wants to test it."
"9131270","9132590"," It's a volume on that."
"9136750","9137790"," 300,000. "
"9151290","9152630"," I'm just having to see anything."
"9159740","9164100"," Biden issued an executive order to screen inbound investments in China early next week."
"9164100","9167740"," According to people from the situation, President Obama has been issuing a long-awaited executive"

"9178580","9181440"," Bostix saying U.S. employment gains are slowing in our early manner."
"9181640","9182820"," There's no need for further rate hikes."

"9185060","9186320"," I'm not seeing anything else here. "
"9188780","9189640"," Tweet deck."

"9192540","9194560"," Don't think pinch target might push difference. "
"9196020","9197600"," Not seeing anything here."
"9199000","9201740"," There's a long-awaited executive order screening outbound investments."
"9202240","9204080"," I don't know what's so bearish about that. "
"9214990","9216290"," This is a farce."
"9220270","9223750"," Zero had to say that the employment numbers are farce."
"9234230","9235210"," Okay, look at pins. "
"9235470","9236050"," Yeah, look at pins."

"9283330","9283730"," Shit."
"9287570","9288670"," Do I believe in God?"

"9321320","9321620"," I didn't know. "
"9321880","9322300"," I mean, I'm not."
"9322640","9324800"," I'm not thinking that badly."
"9325820","9327320"," You can say to everybody, dog, man. "
"9328120","9329080"," I love my dogs."

"12861270","12863090"," So this is where daily is here, right?"
"12864430","12866430"," I need this trade higher here."
"12866430","12867890"," I need that trade higher. "
"12868050","12871410"," If I don't get that trade higher, I'm gonna be up Schitt's Creek here."
"12871710","12872910"," Now I'm down to seven cents."
"12873850","12875850"," So dealers are trying to fucking bleed me here. "
"12876190","12876890"," One way or another."
"12877170","12878510"," I don't have a lot of time here."
"12879290","12882290"," They're telling me to cut my losses and move higher to roll. "
"12882570","12883850"," And I'm not willing to roll here."

"12888590","12889650"," Not pretty here. "
"12890170","12891190"," Not a happy camper."
"12893090","12894550"," Not a happy camper."
"12894710","12898210"," I think I'm still up on the day, but I'm up like 200% I think. "
"12898390","12900490"," But I'm still pissy because I just gave it back."
"12900590","12903210"," A pretty fucking pretty nice chunk of change here."
"12914880","12916160"," Still sitting in calls. "
"12917200","12918440"," That's one down below."
"12918700","12920060"," Next target for you, by the way."

"12933380","12934240"," They're burning my calls."
"12935420","12937220"," S2 is 445 57. "
"12937780","12941880"," And we have a previous low here of 445 27."
"12942940","12944120"," I'm going to pay attention to."
"12945960","12947420"," We actually have lows low. "
"12947580","12949980"," We actually have other places down there."
"12957000","12958320"," Still sitting in calls."
"12959820","12960680"," Not selling them. "
"12960780","12962680"," Hold on to them at the end of the day."
"12966990","12969570"," I'm trading $0.06. Dealers burning me off."
"12969770","12970170"," They don't care. "
"12970510","12971510"," They're like, go fuck yourself."
"12971730","12972470"," We're taking all your money."
"12975230","12977390"," They're like, we don't care for going back up. "
"12977490","12978290"," You're not paying you."
"12978330","12979950"," We guarantee you're not going here."
"12980410","12982650"," Ain't no fucking way we're trading this right here. "
"12988150","12989350"," HYG rolling over."
"12989430","12990730"," Matter of fact, HYG."
"12992770","12995530"," HYG has a gap to fill down below. "
"12996330","12999110"," The entire gap to 74 26."
"13000190","13004590"," If we roll down there and close that gap, you're going to see a major move down here."
"13004710","13006170"," Maybe S3 by end of day. "
"13006510","13007610"," Let me find out where S3 is."
"13010290","13011570"," Give me one second here."
"13014610","13015730"," Hold on here. "
"13018070","13019110"," God damn."
"13019870","13021290"," It might not be done here."
"13021650","13022270"," Hold on one second. "
"13024330","13026370"," Let me check something here in the background."
"13031520","13035160"," Beers trying to get underneath daily trigger today."
"13036320","13037780"," They're trying right now. "
"13038300","13041840"," So here's S2 right here."
"13053260","13054460"," S3 is..."
"13054460","13055240"," Hold on here."
"13055360","13055680"," Oopsie. "
"13057340","13058760"," The second I don't know where that was."

"13061000","13061520"," 15 minutes. "
"13064100","13065780"," I'm some fucking some stuff up here."
"13065860","13066120"," Hold on."
"13070160","13071440"," Gotta find these pivots. "
"13074260","13075040"," There's that pivot."
"13077840","13079260"," There's one more pivot in there."
"13080020","13080460"," It's right there. "
"13082500","13083700"," I've got them all mapped out."
"13085620","13086920"," Or if we come back."
"13087140","13088740"," Look at that fucking blood, dude. "
"13090940","13092780"," Look at that fucking move."
"13092980","13094580"," This thing must have printed fucking fat."
"13095480","13097080"," Must have printed fat. "
"13102180","13104680"," Must have printed fucking fat."
"13106360","13109180"," My puts for the 11th aren't printing fat though."
"13109280","13110380"," They're like 70 cents. "
"13110640","13111500"," They ain't printing shit."
"13115260","13117260"," They ain't printing shit."
"13118200","13121840"," Still slamming down right now in the daily trigger on SPY. "
"13122640","13125460"," My calls are five cents right now."
"13125460","13128500"," I'm down fucking 60 fucking percent."
"13129020","13132420"," Sorry, 66% right now on my calls. "
"13133140","13135260"," We've got a previous low down here."
"13140840","13142780"," Just text previous low."
"13147970","13149270"," The next previous low. "
"13149630","13150170"," That's not the low."
"13150390","13153390"," He has previous low last known demand at 445."
"13153390","13161010"," It's 445, 441, 448, 89 on spoos. "
"13164060","13165540"," Yeah, damn bears."
"13166120","13167800"," Oh, telling me bears."
"13168740","13171020"," One minute chart for the sexy for you at home. "
"13172040","13173760"," Well, look at that being generous."
"13174140","13175380"," Fuck, no, I wasn't being generous."
"13176220","13178120"," Fuck, no cap was way wrong. "
"13179600","13181120"," New target right here."
"13181200","13182100"," This is your daily trigger."
"13182340","13183260"," You slammed into it. "
"13183860","13185820"," S1 at 447 21."
"13186440","13188660"," And then I got another target for you down below you ready."
"13188840","13189780"," I think S2 is 445. "
"13190380","13191520"," But let me give you S3 too."
"13191960","13194460"," Because there's some blood setting up here."
"13194660","13196800"," Some major blood setting up here. "
"13198060","13201400"," Nasdaq coming down for a new low right now."
"13203800","13206620"," Nasdaq 3, 1, 5, 6, 2 coming down."
"13208200","13209680"," Trade in 3, 1, 8."
"13209880","13211840"," So we have more lows coming on SPY. "
"13211840","13214520"," We have a low coming right now for 447."
"13215480","13218360"," 21 is on its way in just a second here in SPY."
"13219480","13220720"," Just a second here. "
"13220720","13221560"," We'll be getting down there."
"13222240","13224000"," We're going to get down to this S1 guaranteed."
"13224780","13234600"," We have a previous low target down below of 445, 21 and 444, 89 blood in SPY right"
"13234600","13235860"," now pure blood. "
"13236180","13238560"," This is probably the worst day we've had."
"13239360","13241460"," I got to check and see what this rollover is."
"13241640","13243280"," This is a serious rollover. "
"13244180","13245260"," Hold on one second here."
"13247980","13249180"," Let's pick this last one."
"13253590","13256450"," It falls four cents right now getting destroyed. "
"13259560","13260480"," Those are gone."
"13260920","13262340"," Guaranteed gone right now."
"13262560","13263140"," Never coming back. "
"13263360","13264100"," Those things are never recovering."
"13264520","13265060"," They're just gone."
"13265920","13267500"," 443, 79. "
"13275240","13276660"," I think that might be doable."
"13277800","13278820"," It's possible."
"13279940","13281100"," Not probable, but possible. "
"13284990","13286390"," Like we could tag that down there."
"13287530","13289490"," Not probable, but possible."
"13290970","13292030"," S1 right now. "
"13293110","13294510"," 447, 21."
"13296250","13298350"," Yeah, we're still, I think we still tagged this."
"13301970","13303810"," No way I'm getting that money back. "
"13304010","13305390"," That money is gone, baby."
"13306530","13307010"," Gone."
"13308410","13309670"," God damn bears. "

"13315070","13316270"," How much percentage that was. "
"13316970","13318530"," That was a huge win for bears."
"13319510","13321490"," If you were on puts on that, congratulations."
"13322010","13324170"," You ready for how far down we've gone so far?"
"13324910","13326810"," God damn look at that. "
"13327910","13328930"," High tick."
"13330090","13332450"," So low tick right now where we are."
"13333650","13340110"," 1.2% intraday move for spy to the down side. "
"13340630","13344130"," So from this top tick right here all the way down here."
"13344850","13348690"," 1.2% move for the bears."
"13348690","13352630"," That is a huge intraday swing for bears. "
"13352870","13354030"," I don't think we've seen this."
"13354850","13356370"," Oh, let me see if I had what?"
"13356610","13359070"," 1.2% move in a day."
"13360070","13361570"," Maybe on Thursday we did. "
"13363510","13364230"," Opening bell."
"13367360","13367800"," Nope."
"13369400","13370480"," Nope, not in it. "
"13370580","13371580"," We haven't had that away."
"13371920","13373020"," We might have had it last week."
"13374220","13377060"," Might have had a 1% move greater than 1% move. "
"13377900","13379040"," On the opening tick."

"15484080","15491200"," trade for you make sense to make sense was there a bounce today on the on the hourly no right"
"15491200","15496680"," so is there any chance to put money on the market here no right so so my point to you"
"15496680","15504180"," here is if you're a bull you have no trade none until this resolves to the upside you got nothing"
"15504180","15512000"," and this failure here dude i'm telling you what this fucking failure here on spoos for bulls not to"
"15512000","15518980"," to start closing that gap immediately does not look good does not look good for bulls because"
"15518980","15522600"," that's not a step you when you're squeezing it's because it's when you're squeezing your clothes"
"15522600","15527300"," and shorts just to slam that those shorts back down if they were actual buyers if they were actual"
"15527300","15531860"," buyers down there we would have held and continued higher would have marched up forward and forward"
"15531860","15541140"," so if you have buyers here right let's see these are buyers right these are sellers right if we"
"15541140","15546320"," trade down right we hit buyers we're like hey those buyers or are we are we bouncing because the"
"15546320","15551700"," buyers are here because they're just taking the money to short again right if these were buyers"
"15551700","15559580"," they would be here and they would continue to buy and overrun these sellers right here make sense"
"15559580","15565360"," but these aren't buyers this is just a squeeze right here right now okay so that it's really"
"15565360","15571880"," against you as a bull right now you got nothing right now you got nothing until he can find real"
"15571880","15577960"," buyers and right now there are no real buyers real buyers for spy you want to know who they are"
