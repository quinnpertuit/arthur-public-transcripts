"DoN5rc-RNzY","148000","153000"," I think that's it. There we go."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","153000","162000"," Play was scrubbed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","162000","166000"," Get right into it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","166000","169000"," Okay."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","170000","173000"," Some of you are all excited already. Happy week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","173000","175000"," Hope you had a happy weekend."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","175000","181000"," Where I am we had a."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","181000","185000"," We had."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","185000","193000"," I think a horse lover fat said something this morning said 80 degrees and then snow."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","193000","195000"," That's pretty much what the weather is like here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","195000","202000"," It's been a wild weekend with weather cold fronts blasting in yesterday to some point."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","202000","205000"," So it's like winter all over again."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","205000","210000"," Fake summer."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","210000","213000"," Good thing is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","213000","216000"," Let's talk about this open right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","216000","219000"," And what's going on right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","219000","226000"," You can see it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","226000","231000"," And without saying anything, what do you guys think what's going on out there?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","231000","233000"," I want to know what you guys think right now at this moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","233000","237000"," What do you think is happening in the market at this moment?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","237000","244000"," It's kind of an important question to be asking here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","244000","248000"," I am interested to see what it takes place here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","248000","250000"," So the VIX right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","250000","255000"," VIX right now is trying to of course catch its legs right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","255000","261000"," VIX is trading 1751 at the moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","261000","268000"," Like this could be some kind of a trap for bulls up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","268000","274000"," With that said."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","274000","277000"," The spy right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","277000","284000"," We're going to take a look at the spy in a one minute chart and then we're going to take a look at a."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","284000","289000"," A 30 minute chart on the spy this morning."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","289000","307000"," I'm going to mute this here in the background."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","307000","312000"," Now normally off of."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","312000","316000"," I want you to see this specifically here normally off right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","316000","319000"," Hello there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","319000","326000"," So this is a great learning learning time for traders here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","326000","330000"," Let me explain why."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","330000","332000"," So we have the hourly here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","332000","336000"," We traded down into the hourly trigger."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","336000","337000"," Consolidated."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","337000","339000"," This is the open right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","339000","344000"," And we squeeze straight up off of it okay."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","344000","348000"," Now what you do is you trade that squeeze believe it or not."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","348000","353000"," But what we're seeing now is a retest."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","353000","357000"," Of this cluster here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","357000","359000"," And."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","359000","365000"," Truth be told when you're trading these clusters like this right you grab this squeeze."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","365000","370000"," But the truth be told you're looking for the not just the squeeze but then."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","370000","375000"," The check of the cluster you want to make sure that it's not."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","375000","377000"," A trap right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","377000","381000"," And so if you were to trade this cluster here your stops would be down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","381000","384000"," You pick up the cluster right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","384000","388000"," Your stops are below."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","388000","391000"," So you can look for a squeeze higher."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","391000","396000"," Now the one thing to know about these clusters or a few things to know about these clusters is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","396000","398000"," They're they're emotional."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","398000","405000"," We label them as emotional because of the reaction that that takes place on these clusters."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","405000","410000"," But then we're also trying to find out and decipher hey is this cluster bullish or bearish."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","410000","412000"," Sometimes they're bearish right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","412000","416000"," It's like how do you find out if it's bullish or bearish air."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","417000","420000"," What we look for is velocity to find out where we are in velocity."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","420000","423000"," That's the stuff that's down below."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","423000","430000"," Is this a bull structure is it a bear structure how are we doing in the daily the hourly the five minutes and minutes or the one minute."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","430000","435000"," And then weekly and monthly actually we can look at the three month to."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","435000","438000"," So right now in the one minute chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","438000","442000"," I'm not really gleaming too much from this that well we're going to look at the VIX here in just a moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","442000","444000"," I think it's a trap right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","444000","447000"," I'll give you my honest opinion that I think it's a trap."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","447000","450000"," The reason I'm saying that is because of this only to look at this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","450000","452000"," So you do see."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","452000","455000"," The hour of our leave velocity up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","455000","462000"," Is kind of peeking out right on the daily we're kind of kind of starting to max out here on the hourly."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","462000","464000"," You see this just beginning here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","464000","468000"," See this these green bars starting to grow and that it's the downside."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","468000","470000"," Showing a week Monday to me."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","470000","473000"," I'm just letting you know what it's showing at the moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","473000","475000"," It's kind of a bull trap setting up."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","475000","477000"," This is on a one minute chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","477000","479000"," Now I'm going to look at the 30 minute chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","479000","482000"," And try to decipher if."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","482000","485000"," And you can see right here we've got this little green bar down below."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","485000","487000"," You can see the roll over in the hourly here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","487000","490000"," We're kind of peeking out on the bullish daily."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","490000","492000"," Candle here as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","492000","498000"," So the 30 minute chart and spy is saying to me that we're a little overbought right now at this moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","499000","503000"," Now even though we're overbought on the prior of 44."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","503000","508000"," You can see that we've been trading this hourly like it's nobody's business right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","508000","511000"," So if you're looking for a place to buy."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","511000","513000"," It's probably going to be lower."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","513000","514000"," Where is that lower?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","514000","516000"," You know somewhere in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","516000","518000"," You can see that all this is getting bought up."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","518000","522000"," Four eleven four ten something like that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","522000","526000"," And what we talked about this these numbers back on Friday is closed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","527000","529000"," Try to buy so you'd rather buy something down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","529000","532000"," We wanted to buy lower than this on Friday as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","532000","534000"," Wanted to buy down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","534000","538000"," And the question becomes that a Monday are going to go higher right off the bell."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","538000","542000"," So just overall impression is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","542000","546000"," So this is a bull trap for a Monday."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","546000","549000"," Now on VIX."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","549000","550000"," Right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","550000","555000"," We were we were trading this all past couple of weeks by sell by sell by sell by sell by sell by sell by sell by sell by sell."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","555000","556000"," Right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","556000","559000"," And this is where the trap looks like."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","559000","562000"," This is this looks like this is where the trap is right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","562000","564000"," You saw the VIX back here on Friday."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","564000","568000"," Get bought and we're underneath the hourly right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","568000","571000"," So can the VIX crash hell yeah I can."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","571000","575000"," They got rejected fully off the hourly candle right off the open this morning."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","575000","579000"," So we could possibly squeeze up higher and then reverse."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","579000","581000"," Big up and clean up the top maybe."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","581000","583000"," And then we reverse down."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","583000","584000"," Right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","584000","587000"," So spy goes up VIX VIX goes down spy goes up."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","587000","591000"," And then it squeezes you get the bottom down below it's 1706."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","591000","597000"," And we talked about 1706 last week right kept harping on it harping on it 1706."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","597000","599000"," You can see that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","599000","602000"," Friday at 64 NPM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","602000","604000"," We nailed it right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","605000","612000"," Actually it was that a 340 in the afternoon then six and then six four or four PM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","612000","615000"," So there's some room to go up."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","615000","619000"," Looks like there's some room to go up but then of course."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","619000","623000"," It does look kind of toppy at this point."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","623000","625000"," So overall."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","625000","629000"," Well if you do trade this today as a bull."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","630000","639000"," You trade this even if we squeeze higher you're going to probably get some kind of a blow off on the daily at least."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","639000","643000"," So what would you look for in the upside here right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","643000","647000"," What's the what are some targets to the upside and we've got some."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","647000","650000"," We've got this nice little bad boy up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","650000","655000"," We got 413 70 above the tag."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","656000","659000"," We've got some gaps to close above here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","659000","668000"," Right so you've got your you get your gaps up here you've got your 413 70 on the day above."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","668000","674000"," You've got our one above that at 1502."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","674000","679000"," On Friday we also talked on Friday about."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","679000","682000"," We're at the expectation for top."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","683000","686000"," For this week as a Friday I'll look at it right now but."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","686000","688000"," There's a Friday for this week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","688000","692000"," Range is expected to four fifteen."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","692000","699000"," Can we go to four twenty on ES we can I don't know about on spy itself we'll take a look at that today as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","699000","705000"," Now if we begin to trade above four fifteen."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","705000","710000"," And we can successfully defend it like this right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","710000","712000"," Successfully defend it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","712000","717000"," We can start talking about tagging four twenty we'll get some exact numbers above."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","717000","728000"," But until we break above four fifteen we're going to be a pretty significant level."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","728000","734000"," We will likely come back down and test some of these lower ranges on the week at some point this week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","734000","736000"," Just keep that in mind."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","736000","743000"," Keep in mind today to I mean not that it's guaranteed but to expect any kind of a push higher today."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","743000","746000"," That quickly gets sold off at four thirteen seventy."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","746000","749000"," Possibly even four fifteen."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","749000","763000"," It's oh one yeah it says it's clap here it says four oh two but I think it's for I think the exact numbers for fifteen oh two."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","763000","766000"," We get a bunch to talk about for the day here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","766000","772000"," Not in any positions right now that I haven't been in of course I've got some IWM stuff and I've got."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","772000","776000"," Some rocket lab and that kind of stuff from some underlying."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","776000","780000"," We have a bunch of talk about I've got a bunch of text messages from the weekend."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","780000","783000"," To go over on some tickers to look up and some research to do."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","783000","788000"," And we actually have some other stuff to talk about this morning to about the TV and movie and film."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","788000","790000"," Stocks that are out there too."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","790000","792000"," We got a bunch of crap to go over today."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","792000","796000"," We're going to we have some stuff to go over with earnings Tesla specifically."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","796000","797000"," We do get the US."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","797000","800000"," We'll also look at."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","800000","805000"," The impact of SpaceX flights on the stock market if we have time."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","805000","807000"," It's been scrubbed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","807000","809000"," Elon tweeted I think."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","809000","811000"," Could be a few more days until."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","811000","815000"," The next launch so if I don't get time today to do that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","816000","818000"," We will at some point."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","821000","823000"," We will at some at some point."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","826000","830000"," Look at the impact of SpaceX flight on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","830000","835000"," Or flights or rocket flights on the price of Tesla."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","836000","839000"," There has been if if a flight."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","840000","842000"," Is scrubbed it sometimes."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","843000","845000"," It can be like a moot point but."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","845000","850000"," Think of how that flight turns out does impact price of Tesla typically."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","851000","853000"," I wish it didn't."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","853000","855000"," I used to get upset about it because there we go."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","855000","859000"," Nice little see that four four one seven five above."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","859000","863000"," Some liquidity up there and there's four one eight zero."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","863000","865000"," It's like a 420 up there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","865000","868000"," See if that liquidity still stands up there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","869000","871000"," There it is right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","871000","872000"," See it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","872000","873000"," That's right up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","873000","877000"," 420 on on on ES."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","877000","880000"," We'll tell you what the JPM caller today as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","880000","882000"," As we're coming into OPEC."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","882000","886000"," We'll check the check on those numbers at some point today."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","889000","890000"," And what we have to get to."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","891000","900000"," We can get the VIX to VIX crush into OPEC's and."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","903000","907000"," I found it kind of funny you got Mike Wilson out there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","908000","911000"," Basically saying the same thing basically saying."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","912000","915000"," There'll be a crash once we get into OPEC's."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","916000","920000"," You got you got like a bunch of 18 year olds."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","920000","923000"," On Wall Street that's saying it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","923000","927000"," You got Mike Wilson chiming in with the Wall Street that regards."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","927000","931000"," And Finn to it of course been talking about it for the past few weeks or that weeks."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","932000","935000"," I think after the blow off top discussion went out the window."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","936000","941000"," That's became the newest discussion that the next window of opportunity for bears is a OPEC's."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","942000","949000"," I'm going to assume that I'm going to assume right now that everybody's going to buy puts and it's going to it's going to rip some faces off just based on that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","951000","953000"," Seller stepping in."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","953000","956000"," No, this is I mean, make sure I got this right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","960000","963000"," Make sure I got where that early trigger is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","964000","972000"," For 12 12."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","974000","979000"," That's actually lower for 12 12 right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","980000","982000"," That's exactly where the early trigger is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","985000","987000"," Just down here so you can see it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","993000","994000"," Yeah."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1019000","1020000"," Good morning."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1020000","1021000"," How are you brother?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1021000","1022000"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1022000","1023000"," I'll do well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1026000","1028000"," Do you want some targets for below?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1028000","1031000"," I'll show you those right now too, just in case you're your bear share."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1032000","1035000"," We've got the 41006 down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1036000","1038000"," Says the H line down below."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1038000","1039000"," This is the previous low."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1041000","1044000"," The day before S1 is 409.97."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1045000","1053000"," And then down here, we'll look at the early or the daily trigger as well in case you really want to get on that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1057000","1059000"," In the second area, it's time to look at."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1059000","1062000"," I'll make sure I get some targets for you."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1075000","1080000"," 40818 somewhere down in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1080000","1081000"," 10 seconds."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1082000","1086000"," A bunch of gaps to fill down, not gaps, but H lines down here to fill."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1090000","1091000"," 40457."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1091000","1094000"," 4545 as expected."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1094000","1105000"," We haven't been able to touch this, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1105000","1108000"," This daily trigger down here, we haven't been able to get down there at all."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1108000","1112000"," So there's been no return."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1112000","1119000"," Weakness for this week, 408 and change somewhere down in the 408 area."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1119000","1121000"," Squeezing higher again."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1124000","1143000"," Still have this gap above at 41334, 413."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1143000","1145000"," Put those in for you too."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1145000","1148000"," You can see them at least one right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1154000","1172000"," 6th getting killed right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1184000","1189000"," 7th getting killed right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1214000","1239000"," 7th getting killed right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1239000","1244000"," 7th getting killed right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1244000","1250000"," Some with the expectation for today, something like this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1250000","1263000"," Up down, up down, up down, get up there, get up there and then some kind of a role."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1263000","1267000"," Melt up behavior, nothing different right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1267000","1272000"," All just melt up behavior into earning season."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1272000","1277000"," If you want the best trade there, it's more than likely going to be sell."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1277000","1281000"," I don't care if it's here or here or here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1281000","1286000"," I'm sure that some of you are all going to try to jump on this to catch a low for the week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1286000","1290000"," If you're a bull looking for a dip to buy in here, it's probably lower."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1290000","1292000"," It's probably down at minimum."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1292000","1296000"," It's probably down minimum somewhere in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1296000","1301000"," If you want to weekly dip buy for a weight looks juicy."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1301000","1306000"," We also will talk about OPEC this week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1306000","1311000"," Mopex."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1311000","1316000"," Yeah, I think that's about where it is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1327000","1332000"," Thanks, purple, Tom."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1332000","1339000"," Make this smaller here, too."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1339000","1358000"," Bear cross right now on the one minute."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1358000","1361000"," Just so if you're a bear out there, we just had a one minute bear cross."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1361000","1368000"," Another bear cross coming up right now on the five minute as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1369000","1374000"," Fifteen minutes setting up a bear cross as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1374000","1378000"," Powerly not so fast."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1378000","1382000"," You can see our one down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1382000","1385000"," Great place to buy the dip."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1385000","1399000"," I'm going to start rolling over here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1399000","1404000"," I think if you get a nice blast out, I might not even get up there right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1404000","1411000"," I just go straight down."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1411000","1434000"," Look at some trade here, hold on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1434000","1459000"," Oh, yeah, you got 91,000 puts on 412p, 91,000 puts on 412p for 71 cents."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1459000","1474000"," There's a room to go down here, too, huh?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1474000","1500000"," No, no, no."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1500000","1509000"," I'm still going on and I'll switch this morning."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1509000","1515000"," Oh, dude, who showed that? There you go."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1515000","1517000"," I'm missing a bunch of stuff here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1517000","1519000"," Good morning, everybody."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1519000","1522000"," How's everybody doing?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1522000","1527000"," Phone on 99. Thank you for subscribing to air one."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1527000","1538000"," Don't do it. Subscribe to tear one. Thank you very much. I appreciate it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1538000","1540000"," Good morning, everybody. Good morning. I'll leave everyone out there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1540000","1547000"," Nino. How are you doing this morning?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1547000","1550000"," Morning blindness. How are you?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1578000","1583000"," Good morning. How are you, brother?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1583000","1588000"," Well, you feel like this chart's about to hit heartbreak hill."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1588000","1594000"," We need to pick a direction and go ham for my straddle."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1594000","1598000"," It's not doing too much right now, right? Just coiling. You know what happened on Friday."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1598000","1599000"," We coiled like this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1599000","1602000"," We have some faces off, didn't we?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1602000","1607000"," Nick saying blood."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1607000","1617000"," You're going to get flooded with meetings today."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1617000","1623000"," We expect a rollover this week or the following. Yeah, we're going to talk about that today."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1623000","1626000"," We're talking about if we do get a rollover."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1626000","1629000"," My one concern here is that everybody knows is coming."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1630000","1633000"," So, you know, you just can't."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1633000","1637000"," What happens is they like to slam the zero date put by."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1637000","1640000"," We'll probably happen later on this week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1640000","1646000"," And, you know, sometimes that works if we get follow through."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1646000","1651000"," Sometimes it actually acts as fuel to the upside."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1651000","1654000"," When everybody knows and everybody knows it's going to happen."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1654000","1658000"," Sometimes it doesn't happen, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1659000","1663000"," Yeah, I expect a weekend or a week they love."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1663000","1670000"," I do."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1670000","1673000"," I'm looking for IWM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1673000","1681000"," So IWM my take on IWM is I'm trying to make my thing here and IWM is to try to capture."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1681000","1685000"," Suckers."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1686000","1688000"," You know, like I want to capture suckers."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1688000","1692000"," So not suckers."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1692000","1694000"," I shouldn't say that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1694000","1703000"," I'm trying to capture the run up or lead up into small cap earnings."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1703000","1707000"," And if they can trade, I don't need it to get to 200."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1707000","1713000"," I just need it to get like 186 192 attempt to close a gap."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1713000","1716000"," I mean, I'll keep it pretty fucking simple here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1716000","1720000"," We'll look at IWM really quick."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1720000","1722000"," It's more like this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1722000","1729000"," When I say capture suckers, I mean more."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1729000","1734000"," I mean more like the premium kick run up into small caps ER season."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1734000","1742000"," So just right here on on ER or IWM small caps."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1743000","1745000"," We'll take a look at it really quick."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1745000","1747000"," And we'll look at it on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1747000","1754000"," We'll look at it on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1754000","1755000"," Book map as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1755000","1760000"," So we'll look at it on book map as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1760000","1766000"," So I don't really care if we actually go to 200 or not."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1766000","1771000"," I have some concern here about 185 186."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1771000","1777000"," What I'd really like to see is the attempt to get 25 186."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1777000","1780000"," I don't know if we get to 192 196."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1780000","1784000"," There's some gaps up here we have to look at that haven't been filled."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1784000","1787000"," I don't know if you can see it on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1787000","1790000"," Or maybe you can see it right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1790000","1792000"," Some gaps up here 192 196."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1792000","1794000"," I don't really need all of this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1794000","1796000"," I just need."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1796000","1800000"," I just need like social fucking media to be like IWM is going to go to the moon."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1800000","1804000"," I could give a flying fuck if we actually get up here or get up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1804000","1809000"," And I just need you to pay me on the trip higher."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1809000","1813000"," Now the cool part about where the cool part about where we are right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1813000","1818000"," IWM is that there was a lot of this is like Tesla."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1818000","1821000"," A lot of death and destruction a lot of getting murdered in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1821000","1824000"," And there's probably a free ride up in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1824000","1829000"," This is this is the ride that I'm interested in."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1829000","1834000"," I'm not really interested in trust in day trading."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1834000","1842000"," IWM it trades so slow in my view man when it moves and moves but I don't like getting cut up in all this crap down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1842000","1850000"," And you can already see the cluster is here right you see the cluster to start ripping faces off and IWM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1850000","1858000"," Volume is telling you a lot or the declining volume is telling you a lot about IWM ripping some faces off."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1858000","1863000"," And I will take a look real quick at."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1863000","1868000"," Now a Vix is getting murdered right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1868000","1871000"," Vix is getting hammered."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1871000","1874000"," I do have my provide that fuel that's needed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1874000","1877000"," For spite I just start ripping some faces off."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1877000","1879000"," Let's just look here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1879000","1883000"," This is IWM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1883000","1885000"," It's a one minute chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1885000","1887000"," Let's take it off 30 minutes though."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1888000","1891000"," I like it more now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1891000","1900000"," Why did I why do I like this now that I didn't like it before and it's because of this right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1900000","1907000"," So this so you'll get this yellow box down below here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1907000","1912000"," You know I kind of liked it in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1912000","1916000"," And then I didn't like that now but we're starting to get bullish right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1916000","1920000"," So we're just starting to pick up on IWM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1920000","1924000"," This is a 30 minute chart on it and I want to capture all this up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1924000","1931000"," I want to capture like some explosive moves to the upside and the potential to get up here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1931000","1937000"," Now what I was telling you earlier I'm not really concerned about the 190s and 200s and all that kind of stuff."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1937000","1939000"," I just want that free ride trip."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1939000","1943000"," If there is a free ride trip like all this noise back here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1943000","1944000"," I'm not interested."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1944000","1946000"," I know there's a ton of dead bodies down in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1946000","1954000"," I know there's a bunch of people that are trapped in here which is good because they're going to want to keep buying to make IWM move higher."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1954000","1958000"," This is targets above of 180 of course."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1958000","1963000"," And then we've got a 188 probably 185 somewhere in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1964000","1969000"," Consolidation like trade higher consolidate trade higher consolidate."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1969000","1973000"," And then the promise will be to you know 200s."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1973000","1975000"," I don't think we get there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1975000","1980000"," But I think you're going to see on I think you're going to see on social media that we're going to get there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1980000","1983000"," And even if we do get there I don't really care."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1983000","1988000"," I just care about this consolidation and then a trip higher."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1988000","1989000"," That's all I care about."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1989000","1991000"," I care about the free ride up."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1992000","1993000"," And this is the money."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1993000","1995000"," This is where the money is right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","1995000","2001000"," So overall I'm pretty bullish on the set up for IWM is probably the best set up in the market right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2001000","2012000"," To go along with some kind of comfort and premium and being kicked into the call side for IWM just people just being like yeah I'm trading this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2015000","2019000"," So I like the idea of IWM for a free ride."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2022000","2026000"," Oh look at this all this trappiness going on in here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2028000","2030000"," All this guy this is all garbage to me."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2030000","2033000"," I mean I used to trade this shit but I ain't trading this shit."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2033000","2035000"," I ain't trading it today."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2039000","2041000"," Want nothing to do with it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2042000","2050000"," Okay so there it is for at least I have you on my view."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2050000","2051000"," I like it a lot."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2051000","2053000"," I like it a ton."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2053000","2058000"," TLT has been selling off right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2058000","2060000"," It's in a death spiral right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2060000","2063000"," We'll look at TLT really quick."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2063000","2065000"," This is usually good for stocks."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2065000","2070000"," So this is telling you something else to just TLT on a four hour."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2071000","2073000"," You know this is the same range."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2073000","2076000"," We've been talking about this range since the beginning of the year."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2077000","2078000"," Beginning of the year."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2078000","2080000"," Nonstop right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2080000","2082000"," Buy the dip."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2082000","2084000"," Buy the dip."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2084000","2085000"," Buy the dip."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2085000","2086000"," And look at that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2087000","2092000"," And beginning of the year we also talked about when TLT should rip."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2093000","2094000"," Six to nine months."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2094000","2098000"," So of course you're going to hear TLT bulls being like this was it right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2098000","2099000"," We're going to the moon."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2099000","2100000"," Margaret's going to crash."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2100000","2106000"," You're going to end the cacophony is going to be not in the next time we're down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2106000","2107000"," Can we come up?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2107000","2109000"," You're going to hear the same shit."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2109000","2110000"," You're going to hear."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2110000","2111000"," This is it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2111000","2112000"," Here's the crash."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2112000","2114000"," And you know I'll probably do this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2114000","2116000"," Not guaranteed but June."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2116000","2119000"," September and November."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2119000","2123000"," One of these will probably provide that rip they are looking for."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2123000","2126000"," The good thing about TLT the TLT trade."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2126000","2129000"," Is if we can get back down here again."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2129000","2132000"," Down to that hundred bucks or so it'd be a great buy."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2132000","2134000"," Another great buy for TLT."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2134000","2135000"," Gold."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2135000","2137000"," I keep saying gold is going to sell."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2137000","2139000"," It did make a new high."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2139000","2142000"," Last week I think last Sunday I said expect."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2142000","2144000"," Selling on gold."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2144000","2146000"," I'm still expecting that sell."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2146000","2148000"," We did get a new high though."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2148000","2149000"," Early last week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2149000","2150000"," Although I am."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2150000","2152000"," I am anti gold right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2152000","2154000"," Even with this new high last week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2155000","2158000"," This was I think believe this is Sunday Monday and on Tuesday."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2158000","2160000"," I believe our Monday Tuesday Wednesday."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2160000","2162000"," Blasted down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2162000","2165000"," The fear and greed index 68 out of 100 indicating greed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2165000","2169000"," And the crypto fear and greed index 69 out of 100."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2169000","2171000"," And greed as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2171000","2176000"," Partially may reason for this is if we break higher in the spy and we"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2176000","2179000"," break out of trend to the upside which we have been doing anyways."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2179000","2183000"," The more that we do that the less risk there is to the market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2183000","2186000"," And we need some confirmation for this to happen."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2186000","2189000"," Let's talk about gold and why I am bearish on gold."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2189000","2192000"," Even though even though we made a new high."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2192000","2193000"," We made a new high last week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2193000","2195000"," Can't say that we didn't make a new high last week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2195000","2197000"," But why am I bearish on gold?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2197000","2199000"," I've been asked a lot about that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2199000","2201000"," And I haven't talked much about it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2201000","2205000"," And we'll talk about it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2205000","2207000"," So why?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2207000","2209000"," Why bearish on gold?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2209000","2211000"," It's fairly simple."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2212000","2213000"," I don't normally."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2213000","2214000"," I don't normally look at."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2214000","2218000"," I don't normally look at our used traditional charting."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2218000","2219000"," I use it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2219000","2220000"," You know, I'll use it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2220000","2223000"," But not like it's like if I had like a."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2223000","2225000"," This is my number one tool."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2225000","2227000"," This is like my number 10 tool."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2227000","2230000"," But you can't deny certain things."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2230000","2233000"," You can't deny that it wasn't easy to short these peaks."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2233000","2235000"," Right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2235000","2237000"," Like clockwork."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2237000","2240000"," And there's two things bulls are looking for here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2240000","2242000"," And the first one is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2242000","2244000"," On SPX the least, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2244000","2245000"," We have."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2245000","2246000"," We have."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2246000","2248000"," The potential of history."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2248000","2249000"," Miss sponsored by."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2249000","2251000"," And you just should have for a minute."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2251000","2254000"," So."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2254000","2257000"," We have a negative divergence, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2257000","2260000"," We got a negative declining market, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2260000","2262000"," And we were actually able to break above."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2262000","2263000"," That's a key."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2263000","2265000"," This is the first part right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2265000","2266000"," Okay."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2266000","2269000"," And the second part here would be."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2269000","2272000"," To this, my bearish just on gold would be."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2272000","2278000"," The next key part here would be to defect to break above and defend this here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2278000","2280000"," It's like four twenty."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2280000","2283000"," If there's a successful defense of four twenty."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2283000","2286000"," We're going to go risk on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2286000","2288000"," We're going to see."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2288000","2290000"," This is your trough right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2290000","2292000"," You're seeing and you're seeing more money."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2292000","2295000"," I wanted to talk about this more and more in depth to."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2295000","2300000"," I want to explain this better for you, but we've got we've got a trough here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2300000","2305000"," And we've got a temporary capitulation moment down below."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2305000","2308000"," I'm not saying that we're on a new bull trend here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2308000","2312000"," What I'm saying to you though is if we could trade up here and successfully."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2312000","2314000"," Defend this for twenty."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2314000","2316000"," That this will bring in."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2316000","2317000"," Liquidity."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2318000","2320000"," Into the market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2320000","2323000"," And when you see liquidity come into the market, it's going to say."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2323000","2325000"," We're on a risk on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2325000","2326000"," Environment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2326000","2331000"," Whether that proves itself true or not, whether this is a false breakout or not."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2331000","2332000"," Doesn't matter."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2332000","2334000"," The only thing that does matter is that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2334000","2336000"," You will see."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2336000","2339000"," A flight from risk of risk off to risk on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2340000","2343000"," This will bring money to the market and to that point."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2343000","2345000"," Even last week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2345000","2346000"," Even last week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2346000","2348000"," What I noticed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2348000","2350000"," Past few weeks, what I've been noticing in the market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2350000","2352000"," I wanted to make a point of this."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2352000","2353000"," I'm great."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2353000","2354000"," I didn't forget it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2354000","2355000"," Is that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2355000","2356000"," I noticed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2356000","2358000"," A lot of the behavior of the stock market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2358000","2359000"," I noticed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2359000","2360000"," I noticed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2360000","2361000"," I noticed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2361000","2362000"," I noticed."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2362000","2365000"," A lot of the behavior of the stock market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2366000","2369000"," Has been very forgiving to bulls."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2369000","2371000"," It's another little."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2371000","2372000"," Footnote."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2372000","2375000"," That bulls when they make a mistake right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2375000","2377000"," Are being rewarded."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2377000","2381000"," So if you have a bad entry on a trade right now and you're a bull."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2381000","2384000"," If you diamond hand, you're likely going to print right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2384000","2387000"," Which is abnormal for this market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2387000","2390000"," It has been abnormal for this market for some time."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2390000","2397000"," And just noticing that right now means likely there's some more risk on risky behavior coming"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2397000","2399000"," into the market right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2399000","2404000"," Another thing that I don't ever see discussed or I don't see discussed right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2404000","2409000"," Is what the stock market does when we do break above and keep going higher."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2409000","2411000"," No one likes to talk about."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2411000","2412000"," It's weird."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2412000","2414000"," It's a weird thing too."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2415000","2419000"," If we trade up here and start having a breakout moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2419000","2422000"," The behaviors of it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2422000","2427000"," Or when you use what you consume in social media, what you consume in."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2427000","2430000"," The news and all that kind of stuff."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2430000","2438000"," Is a lot different than, you know, like everyone's going to say, like, market's going to crash, market's going to crash, market's going to crash."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2438000","2440000"," Or not that it shouldn't say."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2441000","2443000"," The market is due for a pullback."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2443000","2446000"," Like that mantra."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2446000","2448000"," Of the market is due for a pullback."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2448000","2450000"," I'm like, okay, why."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2450000","2452000"," Why is the market due for a pullback?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2452000","2457000"," Well, because VIX is at 17 spies at resistance."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2457000","2460000"," We need to pull back then we can break through."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2461000","2464000"," And I think that more has to do with an individual's positioning."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2464000","2467000"," Then what actually happens during a breakout."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2467000","2469000"," Which is the VIX."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2469000","2472000"," Kind of just trade sideways as we break out."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2472000","2478000"," And you know, you're left behind looking behind going, shit, we broke out."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2478000","2481000"," And you know, you're left behind looking behind."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2482000","2485000"," Kind of just trade sideways as we break out."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2485000","2491000"," And you know, you're left behind looking behind going, shit, we broke out."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2491000","2496000"," And meanwhile, the VIX kind of just trade sideways, sideways and down."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2496000","2500000"," Even sideways and up while it takes place, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2500000","2502000"," To be careful of that too."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2502000","2508000"," But there's some, there are little things, I guess is my point here is."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2509000","2513000"," There's little things that are caused for concern."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2513000","2517000"," If you're overly bearish."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2517000","2520000"," There's like little market."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2520000","2528000"," Behaviors that I'm noticing that I'm like, man, that looks, I'm like, that's starting to look like a breakout."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2528000","2532000"," Um, just market behaviors."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2533000","2543000"," I'm reminding me of when we break out from negative divergence from, from a down trend, major down trend."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2543000","2548000"," Uh, you know, like when we're, when we're, when we're in a negative environment, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2548000","2553000"," And when a low liquidity environment specifically, whether it doesn't matter if you're a bear or bull."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2553000","2555000"," Bear or bull doesn't matter."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2555000","2561000"," If we're in a low liquidity negative environment, you can't make a mistake."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2561000","2564000"," You make a mistake and it's going to cost you big time."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2564000","2567000"," It's going to cost you big, big, serious money."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2567000","2581000"," Uh, matter of fact, if you've been trading this past couple of cycles, you probably have more experience and relevant experience in some way than even a long time participant."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2581000","2591000"," People that have been through 2000, 2008, you're talking eight years between those, those big downturns past four or five years."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2591000","2596000"," Uh, you guys have been through some serious wild ass trading."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2596000","2599000"," And so I just want you to think about that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2599000","2604000"," Um, I want you to think about, uh, the idea of if liquidity reenters the system."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2604000","2608000"," The, the, what signs are you looking for? One of the biggest ones."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2608000","2614000"," Is your sins are forgiven. There's enough money just pouring in the back end."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2614000","2617000"," Uh, that your sins will be forgiven."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2617000","2623000"," It's a, it's a big one. I don't know if you guys, you guys know what I'm talking about when I say that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2623000","2630000"," Um, I would assume that I would assume that anybody out there that thought they were a rock star trader."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2630000","2636000"," Uh, uh, during the COVID crash, right."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2636000","2640000"," In, uh, March, May, March, April, May from that point forward."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2640000","2644000"," And you were, let's say you were making tons of money. You're like, Oh, this is awesome."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2644000","2647000"," I'm a kick ass trader. It makes so much money, blah, blah, blah."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2647000","2650000"," And then, uh, you found out that you weren't any longer."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2650000","2654000"," Trading single tickers, then, then you weren't any longer trading blue chips."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2654000","2657000"," Then you weren't any longer in 2020 doing the indexes."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2657000","2660000"," Uh, any of that kind of stuff. If you've noticed it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2660000","2665000"," Um, I don't know if you do notice it or not."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2666000","2677000"," Uh, but when there's no liquidity in the system, it's because it's not enough money to go around, right? It's not like somebody else is stepping in to say, yeah, here's some more cash for you."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2677000","2681000"," Uh, for your fuck up. I'll buy. I'll buy. I'll buy. I'll buy."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2681000","2685000"," That doesn't mean it's like we're in that environment like we were in 2020 either."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2685000","2693000"," Um, like just the craziness of that much money coming to the market, but it can, I can see a difference."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2694000","2698000"," Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's paint, but it's there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2698000","2703000"," Uh, let me know if you think that if you, if you've noticed it as well."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2703000","2722000"," Uh, you know, I got to tell you, I got to be honest, again, a little liquidity environments. If you're positioned wrong, you're fucked."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2722000","2729000"," Uh, I'm 100% right now for the past past year. Well, specifically the indexes past year."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","2733000","2739000"," Individual tickers, uh, like our spec growth two years ago and then, uh,"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2739000","2742000"," Blue chips that didn't have corporate debt bonds."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2742000","2748000"," Um, and then of course corporate debt bonds stocks last year and the indexes last year."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2749000","2755000"," I know I'm noticing, I'm noticing that if you just hold, it's going to fucking print."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2755000","2759000"," And I'm like, this is, this is smelling like melt up to me."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2759000","2764000"," Uh, more or even more so than melt up, but smelling like, uh, much higher highs."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2764000","2772000"," Now I don't know if that continues to hold just a trap for bulls or trap for money to come into the system or not."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2772000","2777000"," Um, I don't know, I don't know the exact reasons for that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2777000","2785000"," Um, I think I know the reasons for that, but, uh, I think it's that you put your money to work. It's got a constant chase. We have money."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2785000","2793000"," Uh, if any, if any of you out there have money, you already know it's a constant chase to keep, keep that money out, run the pace of inflation."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2793000","2804000"," Outrun the pace of you spending your money. It's not just inflation either. It's putting your money to work. It's like, even just the human, the human side of, Hey, I want to put some money to work on the best way to do that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2804000","2809000"," It's the fucking stock market. When it's sitting on my hands for, you know, two years or three years."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2809000","2815000"," It is that basic sometimes. It is that basic."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2815000","2820000"," Uh, taxes get higher. Five percent's not cutting it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2820000","2827000"," I've put some money into, uh, any anywhere I can."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2827000","2832000"," And I'm just not getting the returns that I want. Sometimes it is that simple."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2832000","2851000"," I don't know."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2851000","2855000"," I'm long, uh, four, 12."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","2875000","2880000"," Oh, I did that thinking that I did that thinking that I was."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2880000","2888000"," Did that thinking I was watching the VIX, but in fact, I was watching IWM. That was a bad move on my part."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2888000","2894000"," I was like, Oh, I was like, VIX looks bullish."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2894000","2906000"," Probably don't fuck myself in this trade here in just a minute. I love a few pennies, but."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2906000","2913000"," Now trading 51 cents for 12 P."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2913000","2917000"," We need to get out of this trade."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2917000","2920000"," Pull out air."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2937000","2950000"," I'm flat out of 50 cents on, uh, IWM."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2950000","2957000"," That was the wrong chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","2980000","2990000"," Jason Hendricks, baby, the H line, the treasury yields extending their climb with the two year up nine basis points on the day."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3010000","3034000"," Just a second here."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","3462040","3465400"," Straight in 1740, you need to be fixed to get up to 1749."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3493040","3499040"," I should have held one of those fucking puts."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3505040","3510040"," They're trading 71 cents right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3510040","3529040"," I'm flat right now."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","3582040","3589040"," I talked about that last week, right?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3589040","3596040"," Bud."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3596040","3601040"," HYG selling pretty hard right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3601040","3606040"," I'm going to get a nice push right here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3606040","3617040"," 410-06-409-97 and then the 408-05-4873 would be where I want to see us go if possible at all early this week."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3617040","3621040"," For a dip, someone was asking, I think I talked about that in the earlier in the broadcast."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3621040","3626040"," I don't know how I go half an hour ago, something like that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3627040","3630040"," Nice bear cross above in the one minute chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3630040","3632040"," Five minute chart."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3632040","3634040"," Also bear cross right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3634040","3648040"," I should start seeing lower lows right now."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3648040","3654040"," Vicks trading up to 1747 want to see Vicks tag 1750."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3654040","3661040"," Pull back on the spike up higher on the spy here in just a moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3661040","3665040"," We'll get continued selling in just a few moments after that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3678040","3689040"," What was your question?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3689040","3693040"," If you held on, would you sell now or keep holding I held?"
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3693040","3695040"," You can keep holding."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3695040","3697040"," We're probably not done going down."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3697040","3705040"," There's going to be a quick rip higher and then we should get some more consolidation than another move down here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3705040","3721040"," As well seeing the NASDAQ 100 slides, 0.5% to a session loan, whether it's the S&P down 0, spot 1%."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3721040","3733040"," 4.10 is early 19 cents though, it's kind of surprising."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","3740040","3749040"," Here I'll show it to you on another chart here, hold on."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3749040","3758040"," So just on the Vicks here, you can see this squeezing taking place right now in the Vicks."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3758040","3764040"," You get a little bit of consolidation here, grind and then an explosive move higher right there."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3764040","3768040"," See it."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3768040","3778040"," And your target above is $17.80."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3778040","3779040"," It's going to be a minute."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3779040","3781040"," You'll see a squeeze of higher here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3781040","3788040"," This is the one minute chart, beautiful, beautiful barrel plane here forming to the downside."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3788040","3795040"," On spy, five minute chart, same thing."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3795040","3802040"," It shouldn't take too much longer now."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","3828040","3834040"," I'm going through a tweet deck right now for Walter Bloomberg."

"DoN5rc-RNzY","3873040","3888040"," For bears are looking for."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3888040","3893040"," A rejection above and continued downside here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3893040","3900040"," Just like that."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3924040","3925040"," Give me just a second here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3925040","3947040"," I'm trying to jump in on this on the short side here."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3947040","3961040"," Looking at the four 12s, again, there's 67.68 cents."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3961040","3968040"," Trying to catch that downside reversal here in just a moment."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3977040","3985040"," I'm probably going to have to add to this position."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3985040","3990040"," I don't want to miss it if it does begin to roll."
"DoN5rc-RNzY","3990040","3998040"," If we squeeze up a little bit more, I'll add to it, bring it up here."
