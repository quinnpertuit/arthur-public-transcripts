"7700","8140"," Okay."
"8140","23990"," All right, check"
"23990","24850"," one two check."
"28840","29620"," Oh, yeah. "
"33190","34410"," You guys hear me out there?"
"38230","39730"," Check one two, check one two."
"40670","41330"," I don't hear anything."
"41830","43550"," I've got it on a monitor right now. "
"43710","49620"," Oh, yeah, I can hear myself."
"52520","61040"," So I've got, I have more, I'm having more problems with my internet."
"62220","65860"," I've had Comcast out now three times. "
"67080","71120"," And this time they're saying that it's an amplifier."
"72260","73500"," It's not on my line."
"74680","76920"," They're not supposedly they fixed it today. "
"77300","80640"," When I was down this morning, it's back on again."
"81200","88000"," So I don't know if we if I drop again, we'll know what's happening on my end is I try"
"88000","93200"," to do a live I try to get on anything that uses like anything like book map."
"95100","97320"," Zoom calls, anything video related. "
"98540","104920"," And my signal dumps it like I want to say it taps like tap, tap, tap, tap."
"104920","105840"," And then it just drops."
"108080","109840"," So I'm having problems with my internet. "
"110080","115720"," Now they're saying at this point that it was something further down the line."
"115980","116900"," It was called an amplifier."
"117220","118480"," I don't know what an amplifier is. "
"118680","119200"," I don't know what it means."
"123310","124530"," I'm pretty fucking pissed."
"125090","125350"," So whatever. "
"127330","127970"," All right."
"128250","131470"," So yeah, and here's here's here's the worst part."
"132170","133410"," Here's the worst part of K."
"133970","142890"," So when it's back on and we have a giant storm coming with like possibly 16 inches and high winds. "
"143610","147210"," So I could be down for the rest of the week and I'll tell you this."
"147410","149570"," The last time that I lost power here was the summer."
"150830","156410"," Sometime in August I was posting and then I stopped, of course, I lost power for like eight days. "
"156970","157950"," So just be aware of that."
"158690","161210"," If I lose you today, I shouldn't lose you today."
"161510","164810"," But if I lose you at some point, maybe they haven't fixed it. "
"165170","165930"," But anyways."
"166910","170050"," But I need to talk to you guys real quick about where we are in the market."
"175880","177600"," Yeah, it's been affecting trading a ton. "
"177920","178520"," So let me turn off."
"178700","179800"," I got a monitor going over here."
"180000","181860"," So a lot of seconds. "
"181860","186300"," Yeah, so it's it's been affecting my trading."
"186660","192120"," I haven't been able to take trades, but it's been absolutely 100% affecting my trading."
"192700","194180"," I'm still in Peton. "
"195700","197720"," Peton puts and then I picked up."
"198780","202640"," Last week I picked up spy February 18th."
"204120","207340"," February 18th, 442, 440 P's. "
"208560","218120"," And then I picked up some February 18th spy, 442, 425 P's today at the opener at some point."
"218880","221360"," Whatever that one of the two tops that we had earlier today."
"223620","228440"," Now, let's talk about the market real quick because I haven't been able to talk to you guys. "
"228440","233240"," So just really quickly, I want to get this out of the way, just in case I do lose you"
"233240","233400"," here."
"235000","237140"," I want to talk to you guys over here on the market."
"238060","240680"," So here's where we stand, okay?"
"242840","245900"," There's two thought processes to the market right now. "
"245940","249900"," The first thought process is that the bottom is in, right?"
"250400","254000"," We know that that that idea that the bottom is then down below here at 420."
"255279","259899"," We do know that when we sold off here, the real damage was done right where we are."
"261320","266000"," Well, kind of right where we are, a little bit lower, right around here where my cursor is here. "
"266840","271020"," Like this 441, 440 area, some real damage was done."
"271500","273780"," And this is another thing to consider too."
"274400","275640"," We didn't expect to go. "
"275900","279000"," If you guys have to remember back to when this all started."
"279820","282980"," Now we didn't think that we would trade lower than 450."
"283580","284900"," 450 was the target. "
"285600","290300"," So when we targeted this 450 here, we had a nice bounce up on the 20th."
"290700","293600"," Then we started to sell down and it became severe."
"293980","302360"," And this is the chart that I originally taken the March 2020 candlestick pattern and overlaid it. "
"303180","308180"," That's where we had this really huge move that reminded me of March 2020, okay?"
"309080","311280"," So there's two viewpoints right now, right?"
"311780","314400"," Typically, if you follow the way of guys, right?"
"314780","317360"," We get a bounce here and they're going to retest down lower."
"318640","321540"," And this is the area for us to retest down lower."
"321740","325840"," And on the open today, what we're looking for is a push higher right away. "
"326520","327980"," And we didn't get that push higher."
"328500","333220"," So usually if we're bullish, we'll get a huge push higher."
"333220","339960"," We'll break above the 451 and change or whatever and move on up like 458 460 somewhere in there. "
"340440","342060"," Like right up here in this level here."
"342700","349800"," If we don't see that, the longer that we trade sideways, the more of a chance we end up trading"
"349800","352740"," sideways and down to retest lower."
"353280","356020"," It becomes a bull trap in a sense. "
"356720","359360"," And I'll show you here on book map in a few moments."
"359360","362760"," I had another instance of it running elsewhere."
"363900","366580"," So I only have it loaded up for the past 10 minutes or so. "
"367040","375480"," But the point it stands is that the longer we trade sideways, we could trade up today into tomorrow"
"375480","378320"," and still roll the market over to test lower."
"378880","384920"," Now it is kind of odd because people are saying things like, well, I guess, original, let me see if"
"384920","385800"," we can turn this off here."
"390440","395260"," So originally the price target to retest is much lower. "
"395400","398840"," It's like 400 to 408 giving some change."
"399260","400440"," It is that deep."
"401060","403020"," Now some people are changing their minds. "
"403280","405600"," They're saying, oh, we'll only test 418."
"405620","408300"," We'll only fast our test 420 again."
"409000","411560"," If the market rolls over, it won't be as deep this time. "
"412680","416240"," I do want you guys to be aware though that we can retest as low as 400."
"416240","418800"," There's even targets of 390 out there."
"419240","422760"," That would take us into March at some point if we traded that low. "
"423680","427480"," There's another, oh, say, so we get that one out of the way, right?"
"427900","429580"," What do we do here where we're at?"
"429740","431700"," Do we break through resistance in the sellers?"
"432440","438200"," And the one problem with trading higher here is this move right here."
"438800","444200"," When we traded to 450, right, a lot of bulls got caught in this."
"444200","446060"," These are people that are long stock. "
"446860","449300"," And so they're back now to where they were before."
"450480","453560"," And you might hear a talk on the internet, right?"
"453700","454300"," I'm super bullish."
"454460","454940"," My hyper bullish. "
"455940","457260"," That's really not true."
"457740","460340"," What the truth is is that you've got bulls all the way up here."
"460440","460920"," They got caught. "
"461500","462320"," And they're scared."
"462700","465040"," They should be scared when we trade up here."
"465400","468200"," So you'll see some capitulation by bulls. "
"468440","470660"," And we're seeing that today for where we are today."
"470660","474380"," You're seeing a heavy dose of selling at this level here."
"475400","481080"," You're also seeing a lot of people that took longs here buying put protection here themselves. "
"481200","485580"," So you've got a mix of capitulation bulls up here."
"485860","488680"," And then you've got a mix of bottom buyers down here, right?"
"488840","489600"," That by the bottom."
"490040","492420"," And they want to protect their longs. "
"492700","499220"," So if you take a long here, let's say, into summertime, it's either going to be here or somewhere"
"499220","501340"," over here in March where you'll get another bottom."
"501980","505700"," But either way, they're going to protect themselves at this point."
"505940","511059"," So if you're long from down below here, and matter of fact, I took this long yesterday and the day"
"511059","513559"," before, I just did zero dates. "
"514220","514840"," That was it."
"515299","518340"," But nothing like long, like I'm long into summertime or anything like that."
"518400","522760"," But anybody that took long down here, when you hear the guys that are Ackman, that's like, oh, I"
"522760","527060"," bought the Netflix drop or whatever, I can assure you that they're up enough that they're going to"
"527060","528080"," put protection on here. "
"528380","530460"," So you've got some capitulation from bulls here."
"530780","535960"," You've got regular bulls from down below that are putting on protection here that's going to impact"
"535960","537480"," the price going up or not."
"538000","539600"," So we've got that first theory, right?"
"540000","540760"," We trade down. "
"541400","543880"," We trade into the supply zone of trap bulls."
"544600","548720"," We're also trading into a zone where you want to put on some protection if you took lower here."
"548720","555820"," And that would send us back no less than to retest, let's say 430, 428, something like that. "
"555980","559460"," I'm of the mind that we go lower than 425 to 420."
"560080","562740"," I think we could still test even lower than 420."
"563560","571480"," The second round of puts that I put on our focus somewhere for a target down here. "
"572320","572600"," Okay."
"573060","576360"," Now the second theory would be, hey, we're super bullish."
"576520","577860"," We're going to do a V shape recovery. "
"577860","579060"," We're oversold."
"579800","584020"," I've heard the MACD argument, the MACDs that I've been looking at."
"584160","586840"," I don't usually trade MACD, but the MACDs, I'll bring those. "
"587120","590580"," I'll take a screenshot of a MACD chart from TradingView."
"591160","592480"," And we're not as oversold."
"592680","598520"," I've heard that we were as oversold as we were in March or going all the way back to 2018. "
"599200","602260"," And the MACDs that I'm looking at, nowhere near are we oversold."
"603280","606820"," So I'd be really weary, generally speaking, following the MACD."
"607680","614620"," And I'll post some charts showing the MACD going all the way back to 2018 on a daily chart going"
"614620","616720"," back to 2018, 2020. "
"617420","619060"," And in no way are we oversold in the MACD."
"619320","621660"," So I don't really know that I trust that either."
"622740","626920"," So anyways, the second theory is that we're way oversold in the MACD. "
"627200","630780"," We haven't seen oversold conditions, even though I can't see that my MACDs."
"630780","636560"," I looked at three different MACDs, and I'll say that we're fine to keep selling off."
"636960","639140"," Now, let's just say they're right, and I'm wrong. "
"639720","642460"," And we're going to trade this up in a V-shaped recovery here, right?"
"643440","650520"," If we do break above this 45110 or so, right, we will be bullish to 458 460."
"651400","656740"," And we will be right at a volatility level that can send us higher to all-time highs."
"657600","659860"," So think about that and consider that as we move forward. "
"659860","665980"," The second thing that I want to show you is there's this old-school crab thingy going on with the"
"665980","669620"," spy, where we could wind up just trading around in this area here."
"670440","674460"," And then eventually sell off into the March OPEX."
"674940","681060"," You could trap bulls, bears, for honestly an entire month, which would be kind of wild, right?"
"681180","685400"," You could sell down into OPEX, let's say, on the 18th, but not the market. "
"685720","686580"," You don't sell the market."
"687100","688980"," You just sell it up slightly, right?"
"688980","694840"," You trade outside of our trading range, and then you trade lower than our trading range, but you"
"694840","696360"," stay in this vicinity here."
"696840","699040"," It's called this downward crab or something like that. "
"699480","705840"," And what you end up doing is you end up selling, you save the selling down into March OPEX when"
"705840","712380"," they talk about raising rates, and then we blast off and have a great year from that point forward."
"713220","716780"," So it's really the three different thought processes."
"716780","723420"," Now, just for today, I would do you want you to realize that we want to see a blast north. "
"724460","727820"," So you want to see Google Paypal."
"728600","732820"," You want to see any of those companies have a really kick-ass ER today, right?"
"732960","737080"," You're looking for that last bit of ER kick-ass move."
"737560","742700"," And the only last thing that I want to say about us straighten up to all-time highs is that"
"742700","748040"," we start to wrap up the major waiters in our index. "
"748800","750840"," So how long does that rally last?"
"751440","754140"," And then when does profit taking take place after?"
"754260","757920"," So always thinking about the future and where we are in the market, right?"
"758200","761080"," Always thinking one month, two months, three months down the road."
"762040","763740"," What the ultimate goal of the market is."
"764100","766200"," So I'm going to turn this one off here. "
"766560","769960"," I'm going to bring up the, so you guys kind of know where you are right now, right?"
"771360","772640"," I'm sure all of you do."
"772920","775620"," We're trading slightly outside of our trading range right now."
"775960","779180"," We could even trade up here and just sell this down to retest down lower. "
"779620","781660"," So I'll be long puts."
"782540","785280"," As a matter of fact, I was long puts back here."
"785620","790080"," I picked up 442s here and I picked up some put protection here as well. "
"790540","799000"," So I'll keep buying them and the trading, outside the money, zero dates, one dates, that kind of"
"799000","800000"," stuff all the way up here."
"800320","801420"," I haven't bought any up for today."
"801960","805800"," I'm considering buying some of the bell today, depending upon if we sell off or not. "
"806980","810260"," Some more, some more zero dates to try to trade this up even higher."
"811000","814040"," I think I'm in for 5,000 on 442."
"814360","821120"," I'm in for 10,000 on the four, on the four, 22, 425s. "
"821600","824140"," They should print, you know, like 400 or 500%."
"824800","827140"," So this is, my puts are paid for at this point."
"827700","833320"," I want to see us trade higher, but I'm not seeing it right off the bell today as some concern"
"833320","834000"," for me. "
"834360","838000"," Because as we roll this over, the longer we roll this over like this, right?"
"838400","840640"," You will end up seeing capitulation by bulls."
"841220","842140"," You'll see some panic."
"843480","845140"," Every month we talk about this, right?"
"845280","850940"," We roll into the first and we start talking about by the 10th and 11th expect the roll over. "
"850940","855880"," And you just start to see it happen as we, as we trade, you'll end up seeing the days pass."
"856060","859920"," You'll see like the fourth passes, the fifth passes, the eighth, the 10th."
"860200","863640"," And before you know, we're down here somewhere and we're like, oh shit, it's not going to spring"
"863640","863940"," higher. "
"864520","865920"," We got a capitulation move lower."
"866560","867960"," And then we're into, we're into OPEX, right?"
"868360","869020"," Try try again."
"870240","871860"," So I'm going to turn this one off right now. "
"874060","878260"," And I'm going to bring up the, this is, and this is the other thing that I wanted to show"
"878260","878700"," you from today."
"878700","883800"," So this line wasn't here until this morning when we actually opened, right?"
"883920","884740"," The line was higher."
"885280","888980"," It was at like 4.55, 4.56 this morning. "
"889200","890660"," And then as soon as we opened, right?"
"891080","897000"," As soon as we opened this big, this big wave of sellers just came straight down and met up at"
"897000","898960"," 4.51. They've been here all day long today."
"900260","907260"," This, the CVD buyers and sellers, this hero indicator, it's, it's representative of the day."
"907260","911240"," But it's not the, the size volume that we've had. "
"911300","912900"," We had massive volume today."
"913860","915100"," Massive, massive volume."
"915580","918940"," It's slightly better than the bears and the bulls favor all day long. "
"919880","923460"," But the, the relentlessness of sellers has been monstrous."
"924420","929300"," So the question becomes do the bulls end up pulling the, the buy program at some point?"
"929400","934100"," And if they do, you will see these sellers continue to sell, sell us down."
"934100","937820"," Now the hero indicators showing a low number, a low negative number. "
"938180","945300"," But it's, it's the, for the whole day, it's at like minus, I don't know, 55 or 60 something"
"945300","948000"," thousand or something and saying like that."
"948360","950420"," So this is slightly deceiving down here."
"950880","954860"," I wish I had the right numbers on this broadcast, but I don't. "
"956480","957780"," So that's the question, right?"
"957940","958520"," Do we trade higher?"
"958520","967980"," You don't want to take this long to four, 58 or 460 until you see a break above four, five,"
"968240","969360"," one, five, zero."
"969780","971380"," So right now, just a waiting game."
"971560","973820"," You wait for like we always say, right?"
"974540","976720"," That this is the same on the top and the bottom. "
"977160","981140"," You wait for the banks to do the heavy lifting for you."
"981420","985580"," So if you're a bull, you should have already closed out your lungs yesterday at the bell."
"985580","988380"," You should have closed them up the day before in the bell as well, right?"
"988700","990660"," You just taking your money and you're running every day. "
"991100","995240"," And as we trade up into this area here and bouncing around here all day long in this small trading"
"995240","996660"," zone, you're going to wait."
"997140","1002420"," You don't need to have, you don't need to have the, whatever money you're going to make between,"
"1002420","1012240"," you know, 450, call it 450 flat and 450 for the other 85 points"
"1012240","1013000"," if we're bullish."
"1013940","1017560"," If you're bearish here, right, you put on put spreads. "
"1017760","1018820"," That's the easiest thing to do."
"1018960","1020380"," You can date them out to mid February."
"1020740","1023740"," You can date them out to March in the money. "
"1024160","1028280"," And as we step up, you just keep adding them with farther out dates and they eventually print"
"1028280","1030500"," whether we go up or go down."
"1030500","1034160"," We know that we always change course at some point and give some of it back."
"1037540","1038859"," Good to see everybody, by the way. "
"1039339","1044079"," So if anyone is just checking in, I am having problems with Comcast right now."
"1044079","1047060"," I've had Comcast out now, I think three times."
"1047760","1049400"," One time I did send them away. "
"1049560","1051200"," I remember they showed up in one of our broadcasts."
"1051520","1052420"," There was a guy walking around."
"1052800","1053740"," I think you can hear him in the background. "
"1055440","1057200"," We've had problems with Comcast."
"1058660","1061360"," And this time they're saying it's an amplifier."
"1061880","1062860"," It's down the line. "
"1063040","1065240"," It's not from the pole or at my house."
"1065780","1069040"," I guess they have an amplifier and I'm dropping signal."
"1069040","1072400"," I'll have dropped signals like tap, tap, tap. "
"1072620","1073260"," One, two, three."
"1074240","1075920"," And it disconnects me from streams."
"1076440","1078140"," It disconnects me from book map. "
"1078720","1080680"," Anything that's like using high juice."
"1082120","1083620"," I get disconnected from the internet."
"1084140","1085340"," So internet's been off all day long. "
"1085500","1086620"," They turned it back on today."
"1087460","1091100"," And I'm hoping again that this is the last time that I have no more drop signals."
"1092340","1093680"," So I don't know what to say on that. "
"1093980","1095260"," So we'll find out."
"1095260","1101560"," This is, as a matter of fact, finally they've given me some free internet in turn."
"1103480","1106780"," But I'm pretty fucking pissed off about it at this point. "
"1107560","1111580"," Because they've told me twice three times that it wasn't their problem and it was their problem."
"1112640","1115500"," I don't know what an amplifier is, but whatever."
"1116840","1117460"," So we'll see. "
"1117600","1119760"," So it's 2.29 in the afternoon."
"1120520","1123740"," This is the same by program they've had all day long since this morning."
"1124900","1127720"," I don't know if I can bring this back to earlier today. "
"1128140","1131120"," Or just because it's having loaded this up since 9am."
"1132540","1135920"," We'll see how early we can take a look at this chart here."
"1138820","1141780"," And we did have a mixed bag on flow today. "
"1142320","1144040"," The flow is kind of wonky."
"1144220","1145840"," It was very neutral this morning."
"1146400","1147700"," And it's turned up somewhat. "
"1147700","1152540"," We've got put to put to call ratio of 0.59 currently."
"1153420","1161440"," The put flow is 126,188 to 210,000 on the call side."
"1161920","1164800"," There is more hedging coming in. "
"1165080","1165920"," Take a look."
"1167580","1168960"," There is more."
"1169400","1170920"," Right here. "
"1172480","1176700"," There is more hedging coming in."
"1176700","1181500"," And we've got this morning at 943 and 939."
"1181940","1189020"," There was 7.6, $7.7 million in IWM put stake it out. "
"1189440","1192420"," And they've moved the goal post to March 18."
"1193580","1199080"," There are still major puts on spy somewhere down on the 18th."
"1199080","1200400"," They reposition their puts. "
"1201800","1206120"," And there's also 3 million in spy puts as well that was taken out."
"1206120","1211340"," There's a million dollars on February 9 at 448 P."
"1211800","1212960"," That's very soon."
"1213560","1215540"," So someone's looking for a break there. "
"1216020","1218880"," But there's also a ton of calls out there."
"1218940","1219720"," There's calls on Nvidia."
"1220360","1221440"," There's calls on the queues. "
"1221760","1222520"," There's calls on the spy."
"1223840","1226660"," All of them are dated this week, right?"
"1226860","1227540"," Some of them into March."
"1227620","1230540"," There's some call expansion, which is healthy to see. "
"1231340","1241080"," Nvidia's got call expansion into middle of February and then into February 18, which is all"
"1241080","1242020"," healthy and positive."
"1242320","1245980"," You want to see call expansion for the call wall to move higher."
"1246420","1251020"," We'll take a look and see if we can find a higher call wall on the spy today. "
"1251560","1255660"," The queue is kind of the same thing except everything is short dated on the queues."
"1255980","1257560"," Everything is February 2."
"1258960","1264880"," There's one call out there for 520 May 20, 365 C."
"1265460","1266940"," It was for $900,000."
"1267620","1271320"," So we have one nice bullish bet into May on the on the queues. "
"1271840","1272980"," That's positive to see."
"1273060","1277220"," We haven't seen a lot of that call structure that's dated far out."
"1277860","1282040"," As far as the spy on the call side of things, all of it's short dated. "
"1282680","1285760"," If you look at the spy calls for today, right, they're all dated."
"1286660","1287620"," February 2."
"1288500","1293020"," Some a few February 4, but nothing that is longer than a date."
"1293660","1296600"," So you're still seeing gun shy bulls at this point. "
"1297340","1302740"," It props up the market and keeps the market in play, but it's not the expansion that you're looking"
"1302740","1303060"," for."
"1303100","1305720"," So we still haven't seen that expansion."
"1306100","1309720"," No matter what anyone tells you out there, we're still not bullish. "
"1309720","1317540"," We're not in a bear market on spy, but we were on the IWM and the NASDAQ as well."
"1317960","1320240"," And we're close enough and we're bearish enough."
"1320400","1327840"," And we're in some huge volatility still that you can see a 200 to 200 point move like it's no"
"1327840","1328280"," big deal. "
"1328460","1332920"," And I think even on Sunday it posted on that captain's office something about how we could trade"
"1332920","1335720"," down a hundred points and then up 250 points."
"1335720","1337760"," I think we did something like that on Monday."
"1338140","1341560"," I think we had that first drop Monday morning and then plan. "
"1341820","1345480"," We traded absolutely higher to the end of the day."
"1346160","1348180"," We did something similar on Tuesday as well."
"1348660","1349160"," Excuse me. "
"1349300","1352160"," I think it was Sunday into Monday and then Monday into Tuesday."
"1353040","1353740"," Oh, yesterday."
"1354500","1355900"," I'm getting my dates wrong here. "
"1356360","1361080"," But anyways, so for today, what is the plan for today for myself, right?"
"1361340","1363040"," I'm going to sit on my hands today."
"1363040","1365400"," I've got put spreads on the market."
"1365640","1369060"," I'm not going to pick up any calls unless we trade higher than 451. "
"1370320","1374780"," It was 51 earlier and you can see it's coming down actually 450."
"1375160","1377320"," It was at 450 I think earlier."
"1377740","1380340"," And now it's slightly coming down at this point. "
"1380780","1386800"," So we'll watch together and see what happens from now into the close and see if we're able to trade"
"1386800","1387780"," higher into the bell."
"1388200","1391800"," If we get a nice squeeze, we could get a short covering into the bell."
"1392580","1398660"," If you get a short covering into the bell, I would expect that we trade higher into the rest of"
"1398660","1398880"," the week. "
"1399020","1404540"," We could end up trading into Friday into that 460 or 458 I think is what I had in the"
"1404540","1404780"," chart."
"1405380","1410480"," Now, if we don't have any short covering into the bell, I'm going to expect capitulation over the"
"1410480","1411500"," next one to three days."
"1412040","1418020"," We could get very bearish even with a good report on Google on PayPal. "
"1419080","1421740"," There's a few others that are reporting today as well."
"1421820","1428240"," I think the coffee company is where they start."
"1428440","1429620"," I think Starbucks reports today. "
"1429700","1436980"," Let me take a look and see who is reporting today or at least some of the big ones."
"1444280","1447220"," We've got AMD reporting PayPal reporting alphabet."
"1448160","1450460"," You know we want to see those companies do well, right?"
"1450620","1452460"," If you're a bull, you want to see those companies do well. "
"1452460","1453980"," GM is reporting."
"1454360","1460960"," GM is not a plant, but they're picking up, I think, 5,000 technical workers or something."
"1461160","1465660"," They're expanding their operations on their electrical vehicles here in Detroit. "
"1466600","1473840"," We've got Starbucks reporting, Gilead EA is reporting, matches reporting, micro strategy, and A10"
"1473840","1474040"," reporting."
"1474440","1476000"," Those are the big ones that I see right now."
"1476000","1481740"," And then tomorrow on the open, we've got ABBV or ABIV. "
"1482260","1484240"," We've got DR Horton, Thermo Fisher."
"1484880","1491300"," We've got Waste Management, Marathon, Dynatrace, Humana, Johnson Controls, Capri and Boston"
"1491300","1492040"," Scientific."
"1492640","1495500"," We've got some other energy companies that are reporting. "
"1496000","1498960"," We know that a lot of these energy companies have done quite well."
"1499560","1503100"," We also have Amazon reporting on Thursday after the bell."
"1503100","1506660"," And we've got, what's another big one that I can see here?"
"1506940","1508420"," Mostly just energy companies. "
"1508960","1511600"," We've got real RCLs reporting."
"1512780","1514160"," But generally speak, we got Qualcomm."
"1514500","1518940"," I should mention Qualcomm reporting as well on Wednesday at the close and Spotify. "
"1519840","1520800"," T-Mobile's reporting."
"1521540","1526240"," But in general, the majors are done this week as of Thursday."
"1528020","1529620"," So we're going to watch this in the bell. "
"1529620","1532040"," See if we can catch any kind of a print."
"1533540","1538880"," And myself, I can't take longs at this point today unless we trade higher than that 451."
"1539800","1540840"," So we'll look and see. "
"1540980","1541540"," I'm going to check you guys."
"1541720","1548390"," I'm going to see what you guys are saying now."
"1549830","1550710"," AMD sucks. "
"1551170","1552290"," General Motors, Starbucks."
"1553630","1555870"," PayPal, Google Live, Book Map, Feed and Disc."
"1556050","1556770"," It was a lifesaver. "
"1557350","1557670"," Facebook tomorrow."
"1558210","1559350"," Facebook, AMD."
"1560210","1561190"," I've got Facebook as well. "
"1561190","1563890"," I failed to mention Facebook, didn't I?"
"1564410","1566170"," I liked Facebook the other day."
"1566950","1569810"," So Facebook and Microsoft were two of the ones."
"1570510","1574910"," Facebook is one of the companies that I thought was, had traded low enough. "
"1575810","1580590"," If you look at all the company, all the big tech stocks that are holding the market up, Facebook"
"1580590","1587690"," actually traded down to a very nice number relative to a year chart."
"1587690","1591050"," On Facebook, it really started giving itself up."
"1591230","1593210"," All the way back to March 30th. "
"1594110","1596710"," I like the Facebook trade in the close today, actually."
"1596950","1600810"," I'm going to tomorrow."
"1605780","1606260"," Yeah. "
"1606340","1607280"," Apex Legend skins."
"1609160","1609640"," Yeah."
"1609800","1609980"," You know what?"
"1610080","1611300"," The other thing I tried to do. "
"1611520","1618480"," Hey, Zeus was I tried to switch from Streamlabs OBS to Streamlabs."
"1619560","1620940"," Whatever the other one is."
"1621660","1623280"," Oh, no, it's OBS Studio. "
"1624140","1625820"," And I fucked that all up."
"1626420","1628280"," I need like a crash course."
"1628420","1631560"," I need a better crash course on OBS Studio. "
"1637970","1640610"," I hold MicroStrategy glasses on earnings."
"1643290","1643850"," Yeah."
"1644130","1645550"," Zoom all the energy stocks. "
"1645830","1647390"," Grab the nice bid this morning."
"1654250","1656070"," Yeah, nice bid here coming into close."
"1656410","1660170"," It looks like we're where it looks like we're fighting past some sellers here. "
"1660470","1663390"," Let's take a look here and see what's going on with the spy."
"1677860","1679540"," I haven't done stream elements."
"1681180","1683860"," I've heard about I've heard about stream elements. "
"1684280","1687100"," Captain Tom Lee yesterday and she visited every part all Bitcoin stolen."
"1688080","1691080"," I guess we're going to the companies that bottlenecks and shortages don't affect at all."
"1695210","1699570"," Yeah, I've heard of stream elements, but I haven't used it. "
"1699870","1700790"," And I'd be willing to pay."
"1701190","1702310"," So my problem is this."
"1703190","1704510"," My problem is that. "
"1705470","1709410"," Oh, no, I've got, no, I don't have a problem with the original Streamlabs."
"1709610","1710450"," I have a problem with Comcast."
"1711530","1717010"," But at the same time before Comcast said it was an amplifier, I thought it could possibly be"
"1717010","1721310"," Streamlabs OBS because they pre build a lot of their shit. "
"1721310","1723730"," And it's it has a lot of bloatware in it."
"1723930","1729990"," You can you can design OBS studio to be like slim down, right?"
"1730190","1731990"," You only use in what you need and stuff like that."
"1732170","1738610"," But you also have to build everything out a second time and I rebuilt Streamlabs OBS once this"
"1738610","1738830"," week. "
"1739350","1740770"," And that's shit didn't work either."
"1740790","1742790"," Ended up messing that all up as well."
"1743350","1745990"," I had to go back in and mess with the bit rates and all that kind of stuff. "
"1746650","1748030"," But it still wasn't the problem."
"1748170","1752770"," The problem is that I have an amplifier in the line somewhere up the road that they changed."
"1753250","1756970"," So supposedly I'm good to go at this point and we'll see if that's the case. "
"1759590","1760430"," That's a good question."
"1761030","1763050"," Does anybody think you're going to we're going to puke today?"
"1764170","1767370"," Do you think there's a strong chance even if we trade for what we like to see a strong reduction"
"1767370","1769190"," based on the size of that sub wall?"
"1770210","1777710"," No, as long as you trade above this force if you trade above the four fifty one fifty."
"1778190","1781710"," It means that you've you've you've exhausted those sellers there. "
"1782130","1783310"," You should be good to go."
"1783570","1784710"," We would trade above it, right?"
"1785190","1786630"," Bounce around a little bit as long as you know."
"1786730","1789990"," If you don't see we're well, let me rephrase it all. "
"1790690","1792750"," So we didn't hard reject off it today."
"1793010","1793750"," Let's look at that."
"1793890","1794070"," Okay. "
"1794470","1796730"," We didn't hard reject off four fifty one fifty."
"1797730","1800370"," That's telling on two sides."
"1801010","1804470"," If it if it takes one to three days, it will become a hard rejection. "
"1805310","1806710"," If it takes too long."
"1807190","1813190"," If we're able to break above though, if futures are able to push us above four fifty one four fifty"
"1813190","1815050"," three, we can trade this higher."
"1815930","1822110"," It has to do more with time for where we are and the vulnerability of of bulls,"
"1822310","1826150"," right?"
"1826150","1826570"," And fail. "
"1826970","1828850"," We do tend to trade trade back."
"1829070","1833150"," We give back what we traded to looking for more support lower."
"1838030","1838470"," Really?"
"1838970","1840230"," Oh, I'm missing a bunch of shit here. "
"1842950","1845890"," Raise rates of May meeting kind of place is quite high."
"1846290","1848330"," I think it really helps us right now."
"1849190","1850490"," Missed a bunch of you guys are saying. "
"1857060","1857740"," Hey, Mero."
"1858760","1860760"," I'm missing a bunch of you guys talk so fast."
"1865470","1868470"," Yeah, so the cell wall is large. "
"1868890","1872030"," Not only you've got two you've got two issues right now."
"1872530","1874090"," You've got a cell wall, right?"
"1874270","1875250"," We thought we talked about earlier."
"1875830","1877250"," You've got trapped buyers. "
"1877650","1879970"," So no one thought we were going below four fifty."
"1880250","1881670"," Nobody bears didn't."
"1881770","1882190"," Nobody did. "
"1882890","1884850"," Then we extended down."
"1885010","1886490"," This is that area right here."
"1886910","1890650"," And you've got bulls right that have been stuck. "
"1891310","1893650"," Not all, but a lot that want to capitulate."
"1894130","1895810"," And that's where this cell wall is right here."
"1896590","1902210"," And then you've got bulls that bought the bottom data for twenty that want to put on some"
"1902210","1902970"," protection here. "
"1903410","1909050"," And so you've got bulls or bulls from down below putting on protection capitulation from above."
"1909410","1914370"," And that causes this area here of volatility, right?"
"1914370","1921270"," So we have to see if we can wear out these sellers and trade higher at this point."
"1921610","1927010"," And if we or that we can't wear out these sellers and bulls lose their will over the next one"
"1927010","1927610"," to three days. "
"1928330","1929470"," So I guess that's the question."
"1930110","1932490"," Do we sell down at this point?"
"1933030","1939030"," Now, if we had broken through the wall at the bell, like this morning, I would have said we trade"
"1939030","1940250"," higher with conviction."
"1940250","1941850"," We trade higher. "
"1942030","1945970"," We trade into the four sixty or four fifty eight sixty or something like that."
"1946190","1947410"," Is my target."
"1947890","1952570"," But if we're doing what we're doing right now and Google can't put it together. "
"1953370","1955170"," Into after hours today."
"1955490","1958010"," If PayPal AMD Facebook."
"1958610","1964570"," If Amazon can't put it together between now and Friday, you will see that deep sell off, right?"
"1965310","1967130"," So put on some put protection. "
"1967770","1974230"," Put on put put hedges and then pick up after and above four fifty one fifty."
"1974490","1977490"," You don't have to win the entire trade."
"1977570","1979570"," You only have to win part of that trade. "
"1991780","1992680"," It's too funny."
"1994300","1995340"," One day, right?"
"1995720","1997680"," Not not live streaming for one day."
"1998120","1998460"," Dead. "
"2000460","2000860"," Okay."
"2004080","2005080"," So what do you got?"
"2005180","2006880"," I want to know what you guys think we do into this close."
"2008320","2011580"," My thought process is this or this is what I think. "
"2011680","2012500"," Can you tell me you think?"
"2012620","2013320"," I'll tell you what I think."
"2013500","2014460"," I think we trade up."
"2015360","2018100"," Into the bell right right at this four fifty one fifty. "
"2019240","2023120"," I think they wait for the earnings that come out after hours."
"2023840","2030000"," I think that gives the onus to futures traders to push it up."
"2030000","2030500"," Higher. "
"2030760","2035480"," So we can trade to the four sixty, excuse me, the four fifty."
"2036080","2037080"," Wait a minute."
"2037240","2040100"," Look at the four fifty eight. "
"2042800","2045060"," I've got it a four fifty eight sixty three."
"2046660","2048760"," Now, if earnings suck today, right?"
"2049840","2053340"," If they suck today, we're going to start trading down."
"2054699","2060159"," And if they continue to suck into Amazon, we're going to trade it down. "
"2060159","2063580"," The one thing you have to consider about Amazon, let's be honest about Amazon."
"2063940","2067739"," It's a great company, but they're not going to be giving guidance."
"2068320","2071400"," Well, maybe I guess anybody can give whatever guidance they want, right?"
"2071860","2076920"," But I don't think that they're going to give the same guidance that they gave for lockdowns in"
"2076920","2078179"," 2020, 2021. "
"2078800","2081380"," I don't think the outlook is the same, right?"
"2081520","2086199"," We're going to have the exact same sales as we did in 2020, 2021."
"2086199","2092139"," So probably have good guidance, but I don't think it'll be the fireworks one."
"2092340","2094920"," Maybe there's a lot of good guidance coming out right now. "
"2095420","2099740"," I have to give that to the to the bull theory that we trade higher."
"2100160","2102880"," Myself, I think we trade up to four fifty one."
"2102880","2103320"," We're here. "
"2103760","2105680"," We trade it up here where they pin it here."
"2106000","2107720"," They don't let it sell off into the bell."
"2107900","2112340"," They want to see what earnings are for the companies that are reporting today. "
"2112340","2117300"," The same probably goes for the rest of the week into Amazon on Friday."
"2118140","2124840"," Now, if those earnings aren't anything less than stellar with great forward guidance, we sell down"
"2124840","2125520"," to the pits of hell."
"2126560","2130320"," If I think that matters, I think that does matter to the market. "
"2130740","2134720"," Even if we sell higher to four sixty four, that's we tag all time highs."
"2135220","2137380"," And then we take profit and sell the market down."
"2137640","2139000"," That's on the table as well. "
"2139740","2143780"," But not seeing us trade higher than four fifty one."
"2143980","2144820"," We're off the bell today."
"2145120","2149500"," It lends me to think that if we keep keep trading sideways, if the earnings are where we're"
"2149500","2153500"," expecting them to be, then we'll trade sideways and then slightly down over time. "
"2154780","2156360"," I think we pin it into close today."
"2156800","2158860"," I don't think there's a solve."
"2159020","2162500"," I think we trade it straight up to four fifty one and leave you on a cliffhanger. "
"2163000","2164780"," Grab yourself some put spreads as protection."
"2165400","2170740"," And then if you want to grab some zero dates after the bell, in case of good earnings, you can"
"2170740","2171080"," do that."
"2177720","2180980"," Yeah, I think it's a, I think it's a bear trap too. "
"2188970","2190110"," You think Amazon will miss?"
"2190450","2192170"," Yeah, I don't know if Amazon will miss or not."
"2192470","2193790"," It's tough for me to see."
"2194450","2195990"," It's tough for me to see. "
"2196790","2200510"," It seems like some companies are being honest and others are not."
"2200670","2204650"," You saw the personal income is going down, right?"
"2204810","2207130"," You saw that people are not spending money that was confirmed."
"2209210","2215690"," There's mechanics underneath the hood that look like a lot of window dressing right now. "
"2219860","2225100"," This looks like this looks like window dressing to me in the market."
"2225600","2231520"," Because all of the numbers are showing a slowing economy, people saving money."
"2232400","2236060"," The house buying is showing that people are panicking before rates are raised. "
"2236880","2239300"," You know, people want to save their money."
"2239640","2240440"," So that's fine."
"2240560","2241280"," We can trade this up. "
"2248170","2249530"," This is a bear trap."
"2249890","2251650"," I don't think this is a bear trap."
"2253110","2255790"," I think the longer we trade sideways, it becomes a bull trap. "
"2257390","2259610"," It becomes less and less bullish."
"2260230","2261750"," The longer we trade sideways here."
"2266130","2273200"," I feel like Amazon will miss if they outdo last year or last year they had a blowout. "
"2273280","2273940"," Yeah, they had a blow."
"2274140","2276960"," Like Amazon earnings were killing it last year."
"2281770","2284810"," The one thing I want to see is I want to see. "
"2285510","2289830"," I was commenting on the child tax credit."
"2289830","2291370"," I think it's called or something like that."
"2291730","2293670"," That will force people back to work. "
"2294690","2298470"," The more money that you take away from people will force people back to work."
"2298470","2302550"," But I don't like that people aren't spending money out and about."
"2302650","2303990"," People are not going to restaurants. "
"2304490","2305730"," People are not going on vacation."
"2306650","2310910"," People are not doing the things that they say they do."
"2311410","2313210"," They're not doing like they once were. "
"2313930","2316090"," I don't like that people's personal income."
"2316830","2318550"," They've already bought their cars and trucks."
"2318790","2319970"," They've already bought their washing machines. "
"2320850","2321850"," They've bought all that stuff."
"2322450","2324910"," And they're not spending money now on services."
"2325750","2327570"," And that's of a concern to me. "
"2333870","2335950"," I did not watch CNBC yesterday."
"2336590","2339950"," I've got I've been having some major internet outages here."
"2340450","2341390"," Like I can't watch. "
"2341710","2343610"," I can't watch TV."
"2344010","2346490"," Like so my TV that's connected to the internet."
"2347110","2349250"," Well today or I think I can right now. "
"2349590","2352390"," I couldn't watch it up until this more."
"2352530","2353870"," They've turned my internet off twice."
"2354710","2358850"," They had to and then they installed an amplifier down line of. "
"2359110","2363010"," I guess the amplifier was bad on my Comcast line past my poll."
"2364290","2365610"," But I can't watch TV."
"2365790","2366770"," I can't do a zoom call. "
"2366990","2368350"," I can't watch YouTube."
"2369230","2371150"," I can't post a video."
"2371150","2374190"," I get these interruptions that are they tap. "
"2374450","2375270"," It's like tap tap tap."
"2375730","2378550"," And then like at flickers and then I'm off."
"2378550","2383270"," It cuts me out of my brokerage cuts me off of a book map. "
"2384070","2389070"," Like I turn on my TV to watch something on like YouTube or something."
"2389930","2391850"," And Netflix or something like that."
"2391950","2393650"," It loads up and then it drops the signal. "
"2395410","2397630"," And one more warning to any of you out there."
"2398210","2400610"," We have a winter storm coming where I live."
"2401810","2405590"," And this this last summer in August I had an internet outage. "
"2405590","2407190"," It lasted seven days."
"2408290","2410310"," Like August 10th or 12th or something."
"2410530","2413930"," As a matter of fact, I just got a letter back from my from DTE. "
"2414610","2416030"," I applied for."
"2416590","2419970"," I lost like you guys were here crazy fucking story."
"2421030","2423770"," I think I lost five grand on a trade. "
"2425470","2428530"," I lost internet and power."
"2429410","2430630"," This past summer, right?"
"2430630","2432930"," I have an inverter generator."
"2433430","2434270"," Power my house. "
"2435030","2435790"," Like a big one."
"2437930","2439950"," And big nice quiet Honda."
"2440970","2443970"," And so I turn I spun my generator up. "
"2445250","2447350"," And I go to turn on my internet."
"2447670","2448410"," My internet was down."
"2448570","2451330"," They actually shut the internet down because no one had power. "
"2451930","2453290"," I think they did it because some."
"2453630","2459270"," Well, I think at the time they said it was because they were trying to help out the electrical"
"2459270","2460350"," company, but whatever."
"2461030","2462850"," And it blows losing a bunch of money that time. "
"2463030","2466930"," And I've got a snowstorm and high winds coming here."
"2467470","2468850"," I believe it starts right now."
"2469610","2470810"," Believe it starts tonight. "
"2471950","2474050"," And it doesn't end until Thursday."
"2475510","2478890"," And it wouldn't shock me that I have power from now into Thursday."
"2479770","2481650"," And then I lose power for a week. "
"2482210","2486130"," I feel like Michigan's like a third world country in some in some respects."
"2487770","2491330"," I'm from a West where they bury everything like you bury the power lines."
"2491730","2493110"," You bury the gas lines. "
"2493850","2495690"," You never lose power ever."
"2496590","2499330"," You get snowed on every day and it doesn't shut anything down."
"2500430","2502550"," But Michigan and they don't plow the roads in Michigan. "
"2502790","2505010"," I don't know if you knew that or not, but they just don't."
"2515430","2515630"," Yeah."
"2515770","2516970"," Mero has this correct. "
"2521400","2521800"," Yes."
"2521900","2523240"," That's what I've that's what I did."
"2523420","2525040"," I've been trading on my phone. "
"2526640","2530360"," I've been trading on my phone, but I haven't like I haven't been able to have."
"2530400","2532420"," Like I finally had book map up and running."
"2532880","2536760"," And then I've I've got a thing and trade them by my phone, but that's it. "
"2538800","2541880"," So I wanted to address what Mero is talking about here real quick."
"2542720","2543840"," Which is important, right?"
"2545400","2548620"," So you probably will see into clothes today."
"2549120","2551700"," They're going to park this or trade it up into clothes. "
"2552740","2555680"," They're going to wait for these earnings statements, right?"
"2555840","2561320"," If these earnings statements are good, you'll see futures traders bump us up and over 451."
"2562160","2566600"," There'll be nothing that the capitulation sellers can do about it."
"2567160","2572580"," If the earnings start to come out bad the next few days, we've got the last of the big companies"
"2572580","2574680"," giving their earnings this week, right?"
"2575080","2579320"," If we don't have those good earnings, you will see us sell down deeply. "
"2581700","2583820"," Yeah, I've got it right now."
"2583860","2587360"," I've got two Teslas and I've got a Cadillac Escalade."
"2587800","2588780"," That's my ski wagon. "
"2590200","2592580"," The Escalade is a four-wheel drive."
"2592880","2596980"," It's got all the fancy, fancy, like everything, leather, everything."
"2597340","2599440"," It's got heated this and heated that. "
"2602700","2605360"," Yeah, let's look above and let's look above and lower."
"2605560","2606100"," That's a good question."
"2606720","2609960"," Let's look above and lower on the market here. "
"2609960","2612480"," This is a large way of sellers here, right?"
"2612580","2612960"," We know this."
"2613360","2615080"," We know if we trade higher than it."
"2615700","2617480"," We've got a little bit of resistance at 455. "
"2618540","2622880"," But in reality, if we trade above this here, I do want you to see this right here."
"2622900","2624160"," Do you see these sellers here?"
"2626020","2629660"," These sellers, there's a nice, fat line of sellers above here, right?"
"2630060","2631520"," We've got nothing above here."
"2632040","2633180"," We've got no call structure. "
"2634040","2636660"," All the call structure is dated for February 2nd."
"2636660","2646020"," Literally, generally speaking, the call structure is for two"
"2646020","2647000"," days."
"2648380","2651280"," You get some resistance here at 460. "
"2652160","2654000"," Your next resistance is at 470."
"2662460","2666400"," It's trapped buyers above at that 475, 476."
"2667540","2670820"," Consider that you're absolute gamma strike up top for right now. "
"2671840","2680020"," If you look at the call structure from today, most of it's all dated for the next."
"2683040","2686900"," Your next real sellers are above here, right around 460."
"2687800","2689440"," Get some big resistance here at 455. "
"2690920","2696120"," If we can trade above that and start to squeeze, we should be able to squeeze to that 460."
"2697640","2699540"," Now, we'll look below."
"2700820","2703700"," It's actually much scarier down below, I think. "
"2703880","2704900"," I think it was earlier today."
"2706820","2711160"," What was scarier about down below is there wasn't really any support until you get down to 420."
"2712760","2716980"," That's the knife's edge that we're on in this market right now. "
"2719680","2722360"," Or just today, I shouldn't say right now."
"2722360","2723580"," Get some support at 435."
"2725560","2726820"," Light support at 440. "
"2728120","2733000"," Light support at 443, but generally speaking, 435, 430."
"2736260","2737700"," That wasn't here this morning."
"2738060","2739240"," It was at 420 this morning. "
"2739440","2740300"," It's built up."
"2740920","2744100"," Real support is down below here at 420."
"2744540","2746900"," Make sure you be aware of this here, this is 428. "
"2747440","2752900"," If we were to trade to 430, expect to dip down to 430 or 428 or so."
"2753520","2755500"," Your real support is down here at 420."
"2758120","2759420"," If you got to look lower. "
"2760480","2761860"," I don't know."
"2762200","2765700"," I think we'd have to have some really bad minor support at 410."
"2766320","2771580"," I think if you had all learnings with bad guidance, you'd see 408, 400 right down here. "
"2772640","2774420"," There's major support down here at 400."
"2777520","2783680"," Early in the broadcast, I went through the bull case, the bear case, and the sideways case."
"2784280","2786460"," The sideways case is the scary one. "
"2787260","2789460"," That's where you end up burning both bulls and bears."
"2793970","2795530"," You're at 450, 27."
"2796530","2798310"," Same wave of sellers above here. "
"2798710","2800190"," Big, nice, fat wave of sellers."
"2803000","2804320"," We've got an hour left."
"2804600","2806880"," This is the power hour we're coming into right now. "
"2808580","2813580"," The hero indicator is turning slightly bullish right now, which is a good positive thing."
"2813820","2816680"," We'll see if we can get a quick pitch relation move."
"2817780","2822720"," If you guys want, I'll take some calls into the close with you. "
"2823660","2828880"," Because I do want some one day calls to see where we trade."
"2840300","2850300"," Some Facebook calls coming in PayPal calls, XLE, XLE February 18, 67C for"
"2850300","2851400"," a million dollars."
"2855820","2859200"," Those came in at 2.23 half an hour ago. "
"2903970","2912590"," There's a bunch of call holders on 450C, 203,000 contracts out on 450C."
"2913390","2928810"," What are"
"2928810","2929930"," the other calls that came out?"
"2936440","2941860"," Some light retail buying of calls, 455C, like $30,000."
"2942620","2952340"," Light Apple calls, $59,000 on February 4, 177.5C. There's all retail stuff though. "
"2952400","2955220"," None of this is big stuff."
"2955440","2959820"," Spy February 2, 455C."
"2960200","2961560"," That's where $95,000. "
"2969690","2971730"," Yeah, there's not a lot of support below."
"2972150","2973890"," I do need you guys to understand that."
"2974010","2975670"," There is a steady supply of sellers. "
"2983000","2989380"," Yeah, the amounts of puts for 218 does keep increasing and they're repositioning somewhat those"
"2989380","2990120"," puts."
"2994640","3000760"," My assumption is that we trade up into the bell where they're going to pin it high awaiting"
"3000760","3003840"," earnings and so that they can push it up and over."
"3006140","3014040"," If earnings are good, if earnings are not good, it won't be swift, but it'll begin to get swift. "
"3017020","3018520"," You'll see swift selling."
"3034900","3045340"," Yeah, so we are trading up now into resistance here at 450, 451, 18"
"3045340","3046060"," or so."
"3046660","3053720"," We'll expand this and take a look and see if the bulls and if there's some panic from short. "
"3053720","3055420"," I would expect some panic from shorts."
"3056020","3060500"," Google is not to be trifled with alphabet, not to be trifled with."
"3063640","3073480"," So there we are now at 451.03. We should see some panic, some short panic at"
"3073480","3081320"," some point as well into the bell at 4pm. "
"3099560","3105980"," If you are long in zero dates right now or one dates, be conscious that we could slightly trade"
"3105980","3109620"," back on this trade briefly and then trade back up at some point."
"3122490","3123950"," Got here just in time."
"3137180","3138880"," Yep, panic loading bears. "
"3142810","3144610"," They should panic into close."
"3167060","3168380"," Hell yeah, Mero."
"3168840","3173000"," Hell yeah, Mero. "
"3173700","3175840"," Nice little, nice little pump right."
"3176660","3182860"," Nice little spy pump into the bell."
"3188240","3192480"," Watching, watching, now we're seeing late spy calls coming in. "
"3193500","3199500"," Wednesday, February 2nd, 448c for a cool half half milli."
"3203010","3207450"," I saw a cartoon making fun of."
"3208950","3210890"," It was a Gen Z or something. "
"3211690","3213070"," It was light hearted, but it said."
"3214370","3220710"," Now offering $900,000 for a job and no one was in the line for the $900,000 job."
"3221230","3227750"," The other job said offering a half milli and they took that job instead. "
"3230090","3232250"," It's $900,000 and sound like enough."
"3237760","3246770"," So now we're at 451.59. February 2nd,"
"3247010","3250250"," 452c for $100,000."
"3265560","3267340"," Pimp it into clothes, baby. "
"3270240","3271360"," Pimp it into clothes."
"3272820","3273840"," Not really up too much."
"3274080","3275000"," It's only up 84 cents. "
"3275820","3279260"," There were 60 cents a minute ago or about 10 minutes ago."
"3295830","3297930"," Nice big buy right here."
"3298430","3300250"," Hair indicator is positive. "
"3301290","3303110"," Buy program on into the bell."
"3304010","3337710"," We're looking for a target of 454.35. Just"
"3337710","3339270"," a second here, I got to manage some calls."
"3363770","3367030"," Watching Amazon calls come in right now. "
"3367030","3375890"," February 4th, 3050c, $1.5 million."
"3376610","3384370"," A little bit closer here."
"3397710","3399470"," Other bounce down below. "
"3419870","3422010"," That's same number here, 450, 134."
"3428770","3433710"," Watching calls come in on Apple February 18th, 175c for $200,000."
"3436110","3437910"," That Amazon was pretty big. "
"3438310","3442830"," Netflix, February 4th, 455c for $85,000."
"3453040","3455080"," We'll see if we can trade this up to 455."
"3456540","3459980"," I think that's where the first next resistance band is. "
"3460440","3467060"," If shorts have to cover, let's see if we can find a target if we trade up this high."
"3468420","3470900"," Somewhere, 455, 25."
"3471640","3473100"," I'm not sure we can get that high. "
"3474340","3481120"," But you know that we can cover ground fast if shorts capitulate at some point."
"3485240","3488260"," So I'll put a squeeze target if it squeezes."
"3488800","3491700"," If and we've got what 50 minutes left. "
"3492140","3496140"," If we squeeze higher, put a squeeze target of 45521."
"3503810","3506190"," All that waiting all day long, right?"
"3506510","3508050"," Now we're going to make a move."
"3509350","3513130"," I think Amazon Thursday or Friday. "
"3513730","3514430"," I don't remember."
"3517560","3520100"," That's Thursday after the close."
"3523280","3524680"," Yeah, after the close. "
"3525020","3527060"," Friday fun tickets."
"3535080","3538620"," Yeah, those 455 sees now have interest in them."
"3544140","3545420"," Let's see, they could print 200. "
"3545800","3546680"," I think if they think of."
"3548220","3549020"," Top of my head."
"3549140","3555300"," If we get to 45, they should print like $1.30 to $2 or $2. "
"3555940","3557040"," I call it a dollar."
"3557200","3557660"," It depends."
"3559160","3560480"," It's not an OPEC stay. "
"3564160","3573000"," If you do hold calls into the close today, try to sell them right at the bell or before the"
"3573000","3577840"," bell because you might not realize the gains after the bell."
"3578520","3580520"," They'll trade back at some point."
"3587470","3589410"," Google baby alphabet. "
"3592940","3594640"," Let's look at the VIX real quick, too."
"3604740","3606880"," Where is the next support level for the VIX?"
"3609680","3612360"," So next support for VIX is 2168."
"3614760","3616280"," It's got some room to go down. "
"3630450","3635710"," Watch the calls come in on ABBV February 18th, 143c."
"3636450","3637710"," It's not a lot of money."
"3637810","3639750"," It's split between sweeps. "
"3641030","3644150"," 36,000, 31,000, 38,000."
"3650170","3653210"," That is a bullish move for the spy today."
"3653890","3660970"," If it even though it took all day long, seeing us above at 451.89 is bullish context for a"
"3660970","3661430"," move higher. "
"3662090","3666450"," I'm glad to be aware of that."
"3666450","3673810"," If you break above the sellers and you're flipping sellers into buyers, it should relate to a"
"3673810","3675190"," positive move for the market."
"3695710","3696870"," I'm holding puts. "
"3697990","3704430"," I'm holding put spreads into February 18th."
"3704430","3713770"," I should have taken my put spreads that I've got 442 and 440s, and I've got"
"3713770","3719410"," 422, 425s, but they're dated for OPEX."
"3723750","3725050"," It should be safe there. "
"3725910","3730050"," The 422, 425s are dirt cheap, and they print heavy."
"3731530","3738990"," I'm about break even right now with my calls having paid for my puts, so anything from this point"
"3738990","3740390"," forward is just gravy."
"3742210","3747010"," You want to see if we can bounce off of 451.42?"
"3747770","3757370"," If not, the next target would be 450.48. Watching"
"3757370","3760250"," Facebook calls come in, very nice structure. "
"3761750","3771710"," Facebook March 18th, 335c, $437,000, $53,000, and"
"3771710","3773630"," $155,000."
"3779000","3781200"," See if that target is still there above."
"3783100","3784160"," It's firm enough. "
"3784340","3785800"," It's looking much better than it was before."
"3786960","3796780"," 454.89, 455.18. We'll see if the bulls can pull it together into the close here."
"3797800","3802860"," My suspicion is that yes, my suspicion is that you don't want to mess with Google earnings. "
"3815890","3817590"," I'm still holding PTAN puts."
"3817930","3824230"," I've got PTAN puts, spy puts, but they're safe puts, and you should be in them too."
"3826280","3830380"," If you run naked, you always fail eventually. "
"3831960","3837840"," Watching Apple calls February 18th, 175c's for $500,000."
"3838240","3847200"," IWM calls February 18th, 210c, or 382,396,000."
"3861510","3864150"," NSC, that's November. "
"3864150","3873600"," November, Sierra, Charlie, February 4th,"
"3874240","3877200"," 275c for $98,000."
"3878060","3887340"," I've never seen those calls on Flow Algo, so I'd be interested in those unusual, even if it's"
"3887340","3888300"," divided just the underlying."
"3889260","3891100"," Probably meant to prop it up. "
"3903970","3906570"," Miro saying spy target is 455."
"3907390","3909710"," Be warned in case of a flush by it."
"3911190","3912490"," Whatever naked I get arrested. "
"3919590","3925070"," Yeah, so the thing about a put spread is it doesn't matter when they hit."
"3926310","3932910"," They lose value as it's going up, but as long as it comes back down and hits the target, they"
"3932910","3934010"," print every single time."
"3934510","3939230"," That's why when we come into OPEC's months or even OPEC's weeks on Fridays, you guys sometimes"
"3939230","3941350"," notice that we trade to a specific number. "
"3941950","3945570"," It tends to be because there are a lot of options at that number."
"3946190","3948330"," A lot of call spreads put spreads whatever there is."
"3950330","3952390"," Regardless of where we want the market to go. "
"3965460","3970880"," Watching some dark pool right now that is showing signs of a bullish reversal."
"3973160","3974420"," Which is good."
"3974980","3977940"," The spy dark pool from this morning was not healthy. "
"3978740","3984260"," I was showing signs of a bearish reversal, but the current flow coming in right now, I'm watching a"
"3984260","3988740"," dark pool come in on spy XLF."
"3989540","3990400"," XLF is neutral."
"3992580","3999040"," Now watching more spy dark pool coming in showing a bear bullish reversal. "
"4000220","4003370"," Very positive."
"4007990","4013630"," Watching Facebook calls come in March 18th, 335 C."
"4015170","4021210"," Two sweeps at $279,000 and $228,000."
"4027290","4031710"," So a substantial tech flow coming in at the 3pm hour. "
"4032310","4039310"," Haven't seen this much call flow on tech all day long."
"4040150","4044270"," And also in IWM this morning we had some really ugly IWM put flow coming in."
"4044870","4049170"," But now we're seeing some positive IWM call flow coming as well. "
"4052250","4057690"," Also the queues February 2nd 365 C at $98,000."
"4065730","4070730"," Now it's going to be a duel between who's going to flinch right to the shorts flinch or do the"
"4070730","4073050"," bulls flinch into the bell."
"4073250","4073810"," Let's go closer. "
"4074890","4076450"," Take a look here and see what's happening."
"4088720","4090100"," Yeah, I'm still bearish here."
"4095180","4096580"," I'm still I'm still bearish. "
"4096620","4097560"," I still think we trade down."
"4109200","4110740"," I don't buy what's being sold."
"4111300","4114819"," I think I think the first moment that the bulls have they're going to sell. "
"4122279","4124540"," Well, the trap bulls, not bulls."
"4125300","4125899"," Trap bulls."
"4127260","4130460"," There's two, there's three, there's three, three issues. "
"4131439","4134600"," First you've got the you've got trap bulls were above still."
"4134600","4142620"," And then you've got bulls that bought the 420 that want to protect their lungs."
"4143399","4145279"," So you have that impact. "
"4145800","4149399"," And then you've got even after earnings you've got profit taking."
"4149899","4154720"," So I think it ultimately still goes back to one more nice fat dip for us."
"4154720","4163960"," So now we're trading up to four fifty one ninety seven. "
"4166779","4168660"," Should continue to trade higher here."
"4170420","4173540"," Price target today four fifty five into the bell."
"4189319","4190200"," Do we get it?"
"4191520","4193680"," We bounce around into the bell would be hilarious. "
"4235440","4236260"," Sorry about that."
"4236360","4238620"," I got to I got to manage my trades."
"4264880","4270000"," Now trading at four fifty two trying to break above looking for a price target above. "
"4270640","4273380"," Four fifty five and change forty four and change."
"4274260","4275280"," Right here."
"4276300","4280020"," It's actually a note yet right around that four fifty five. "
"4280360","4282740"," Always be conscious as we trade higher here."
"4283660","4285880"," That today is not an OPEC stay right."
"4286640","4291680"," So when we trade into these higher numbers here we could trade up into the bell here. "
"4292400","4296520"," You could see the value of your calls and drop off."
"4297540","4298740"," Take profit."
"4299300","4300280"," Take the money and run. "
"4301400","4303280"," And then if you wanted to reenter again."
"4303920","4305220"," Reenter after the bell."
"4305980","4311480"," Either at the four like four oh one or at four fifteen especially in a non OPEC stay. "
"4312620","4316840"," As you will see the interest burn off on calls that don't expire today."
"4317700","4322880"," One other thing we're not seeing is you're not so well you're seeing really nice stuff right now."
"4322940","4325260"," You're seeing a bunch of Facebook calls coming in still. "
"4326060","4327660"," Q's February 18th."
"4327920","4330600"," Three seventy five C for eight hundred thousand dollars."
"4330940","4331720"," Hello ladies. "
"4332300","4333880"," That's a nice expansion right there."
"4334260","4335560"," Eight hundred thousand dollars."
"4335840","4336600"," February 18th. "
"4336800","4337740"," Three seventy five C."
"4338180","4339920"," Speak conscience into the bell."
"4340480","4341140"," You can take profit."
"4341870","4347540"," Four thirteen in the afternoon and reenter calls again if the interest burns off. "
"4348800","4354660"," It not being an OPEC stay because what you'll end up seeing on OPEC stays as you'll see in the"
"4354660","4355680"," money or you'll see calls."
"4357180","4360500"," Calls come in that are dated expiring for this day."
"4360980","4367120"," That'll pin it into OPEC's into that that four fifteen hour so you can print right into four"
"4367120","4367500"," fifteen. "
"4367500","4372780"," But with they not being an OPEC's there's always that chance that as we get closer to the bell that"
"4372780","4373720"," we will sell backwards."
"4375180","4380200"," Or at the bell itself the interest just the interest going down on options."
"4380360","4384400"," You can give back everything that you made on the trade higher into the bell. "
"4389580","4391440"," Give me another round of those calls man."
"4414230","4415910"," Give me a second round of those calls."
"4416570","4418350"," Four fifty five twenty four. "
"4418530","4419810"," It's actually gone higher slightly."
"4420450","4421450"," Kind of nice to see."
"4447150","4448470"," Yeah I always sell the bell. "
"4448890","4451490"," If I pick up this like there's a few things that I do."
"4452050","4456290"," So if I'm trading before let's say let's say I'm trading at three p.m. we're going up."
"4457090","4461370"," I'll close at the bell before we hit before we hit four. "
"4462110","4465410"," Sometimes like three fifty five or so in the afternoon."
"4466130","4470850"," If I'm if we're if we are trading down into the bell."
"4472170","4474930"," I'll wait until after the bell to buy calls. "
"4475010","4480710"," If I'm still bullish trading into the bell I'll sell calls the bell on on OPEC's day and then rebuy"
"4480710","4481290"," them again."
"4482290","4483190"," After the bell."
"4486600","4491560"," Especially if we like great like you guys like a week ago. "
"4492380","4492940"," Was it."
"4493180","4498470"," I forget what who it was."
"4499150","4501010"," Was a Microsoft or something. "
"4503910","4510190"," We sold off like crazy we had like crazy selling after the bell and then I bought calls like four"
"4510190","4511110"," or fourteen."
"4512890","4515630"," It was really wonky because we were red."
"4518410","4519450"," But not red. "
"4520090","4522750"," It really didn't matter if we were green the next day or not."
"4523970","4526650"," I think those printed three hundred percent or something insane."
"4532760","4533300"," Timing. "
"4538760","4539300"," Okay."
"4541280","4542420"," Let's see if there's."
"4557170","4559230"," That's sweet eighty six cents again. "
"4559790","4562210"," I had a sixty center and then eighty six center."
"4564600","4566960"," Now up to like ninety seven cents in those calls."
"4567760","4572100"," Those could pull back for just a brief moment to like seventy cents or eighty cents. "
"4572940","4573460"," Time again."
"4576120","4576640"," Terrible."
"4584660","4586600"," Make those four fifty five's like. "
"4587540","4589620"," Anywhere from sixty to eighty cents."
"4591300","4592080"," We'll scoop them up again."
"4602920","4604300"," I've got the finger on the trigger. "
"4604480","4605060"," I might miss them."
"4605620","4610140"," They're holding right around like ninety five cents ninety two cents ninety six cents."
"4613300","4613880"," Patience. "
"4615820","4616400"," Patience."
"4618420","4622560"," Watching some mixed calls come in all small tickers not really relevant right"
"4622560","4630220"," now."
"4631420","4632680"," I'm back a little bit. "
"4633160","4634600"," A little bit of dipage."
"4635120","4638760"," A little bit of a price target here at four fifty two forty three."
"4639760","4641460"," You're still long and calls. "
"4642380","4643180"," Tag it."
"4643300","4643760"," Take the money."
"4645660","4647920"," Calls are up to ninety nine cents now. "
"4650360","4651000"," Dollar."

"6982670","6992060"," Yeah, that spy for $1.03 went up to $1.15. So"
"6992060","6998500"," if you sold spy right before the bell and then you rebot spy after the bell for $1.03, they're"
"6998500","6999120"," now up crazy. "

"7014200","7015340"," We can't say this is good, right?"
"7015440","7017820"," You don't want to be here when you're Bitcoin, right?"
"7018520","7020000"," Just sitting here on support."
"7021780","7026140"," Got more buyers than sellers, which is good, but you've got some resistance above, right?"
"7026140","7033220"," Resistance at $39.41. Resistance at $39.94. Get resistance again at $40,000, right?"
"7033420","7036820"," $40,096, right?"
"7036920","7038980"," So you don't want to see stuff like this."
"7042180","7043560"," See what's going on with Bitcoin. "
"7043820","7045300"," Why can't I get Bitcoin to go higher?"

"7055610","7057530"," You want to see stuff like this on Bitcoin."
"7057530","7060970"," You don't want to see like a wall of sellers above here, right?"
"7061430","7068970"," A wall of sellers at $39.40. A break above $41 is probably pretty bullish. "
"7071900","7074740"," If you can't really squeeze this like you can of a stock."
"7075420","7080980"," The one problem I got with Bitcoin too is it's more easily traded."
"7082160","7085060"," Like if you were trained how to trade stocks with patterns. "
"7086940","7093160"," They still have sellers hiding out here at $42.44. It's not a good look for Bitcoin."
"7094200","7096720"," Like distribution, like a wickoff."
"7097180","7103060"," It plays out better on Bitcoin than it does on equities. "
"7104220","7106380"," Equities have an issue."
"7107000","7110580"," They have randomness, which you can't account for."
"7116820","7123800"," I always feel like Bitcoin trades closer to classic trading patterns. "
"7124460","7126900"," I think people have to rely upon classic trading patterns."
"7127560","7130760"," So it tends to, ooh, look at that."
"7131100","7131480"," There you go. "
"7131600","7132180"," There you go, Quinn."
"7134120","7138820"," Quinn, if you break through a 38,000, brother, 35, baby."
"7140700","7143100"," That'll come in an overnight panic. "
"7143720","7145420"," Like meat, sweats, and shit."
"7145640","7146760"," Like cocaine and meat sweats."
"7150100","7155500"," Some Bitcoin maxi out there will be meat, sweat, and it'll be cooked out dancing at a club or"
"7155500","7156180"," something all weekend. "
"7157200","7159160"," Come home on a Saturday, Sunday night."
"7159900","7161060"," Eat a big steak."
"7161440","7164380"," Drink a big bottle of nasty California red wine. "
"7164620","7165340"," That gross stuff."
"7166340","7172200"," Not that beautiful Spanish red or gorgeous whites from Germany."
"7172200","7173740"," In Germany and Austria. "
"7176060","7177660"," Meat, sweat, and it out."
"7177840","7181800"," Then you'll find Bitcoin down at like $32,000."
"7189000","7191920"," Google is stupid right now. "
"7192740","7197860"," 4.55 C's are up to $1.18. Is there really a Google split?"
"7198640","7199440"," Hells, yes."
"7200500","7201100"," Hells, yes."
"7203080","7204520"," Chase the cues. "
"7205240","7206760"," There's four more minutes left."
"7207400","7213240"," Four more minutes left to pick up calls in the cues in the spy."
"7214220","7217340"," You should get a heavy, heavy ripper. "
"7218940","7221400"," Everyone is going to want Google calls."
"7222420","7225820"," Everyone is going to want to pick up some Google shares."
"7226700","7227340"," Guaranteed. "
"7228000","7233160"," Those are generational, generational stocks that you can own."
"7233960","7239600"," Pass along to your, you know, kids and all that kind of stuff."
"7240160","7242880"," Now seeing after the bell spy calls coming in. "
"7249900","7250140"," Google."
"7251440","7258640"," On a stock split typically what you'll see is you'll see the next day."
"7258960","7262080"," A really quick sell off and then it'll just keep pumping. "
"7264960","7266200"," Typically how it goes."
"7266660","7271420"," I've traded both, I've traded both Tesla and Apple stock splits recently."
"7272080","7272820"," That's how it went. "
"7273020","7274840"," You had like a nice ripper in the close."
"7275620","7278240"," You print right off the bell the next day."
"7279360","7282580"," And then there's a quick dip and then it'll keep printing again. "
"7283720","7285780"," Typically that's about my experience."
"7286000","7295020"," So you're going to see bulls here loading up into the bell."
"7295020","7300660"," Oh yeah, Google is going to all time highs, 100%. "
"7300660","7302680"," It'll be traded through the roof."
"7306600","7308100"," It'll hold the entire market up."
"7308340","7308760"," Guaranteed. "
"7331860","7333360"," It'll hold the entire market up."
"7334320","7338440"," Google splitting is like Amazon splitting basically."
"7341680","7345500"," Massive, massive bullish reversal dark pool on the spy. "
"7348460","7350420"," Probably gap up tomorrow candidate."
"7350820","7351660"," Chance of it."
"7352260","7353780"," Chance of an impact of Google. "
"7354560","7356200"," I mean, there could be a trade back."
"7356380","7359460"," It's like you get bulls that buy in right now."
"7360160","7362180"," After the bell on queues and spy. "
"7363140","7364480"," Marketmakers take the money away."
"7364640","7365020"," It's possible."
"7365880","7367900"," I know that when I was in. "
"7368100","7370340"," So it's weird like Tesla and Apple splits."
"7370340","7374260"," I was in zero dates and a bunch of like."
"7374540","7376280"," A monthlies that were expiring. "
"7377600","7379340"," Two or three weeks after."
"7380420","7381540"," The release."
"7384400","7386860"," And it was really wonky how they printed. "
"7386860","7388060"," If I had held my."
"7388420","7390280"," I think my my my."
"7390900","7392740"," My zero dates printed stupid. "
"7393720","7394720"," And then my."
"7395220","7397880"," My calls that were expiring two or three weeks later."
"7398640","7400500"," Printed better holding them longer. "
"7400860","7404540"," Like not selling right on the bell on that next day."
"7405100","7406460"," So if you're holding Google calls."
"7407060","7410020"," If there's zero dates, yeah, you just sell them and take the money. "
"7410180","7411620"," But if you've got them lasting longer."
"7412820","7416320"," Then if they don't expire like Wednesday."
"7417340","7420400"," They should crank like the premium. "
"7420900","7422700"," Just the premium kick."
"7423480","7424900"," We'll we'll crank them."
"7425700","7428180"," Google splitting is very much like an Amazon split. "
"7428460","7430260"," The moment you see an Amazon split."
"7430800","7432300"," The moment you see a Google split."
"7432580","7433240"," Anything like that. "
"7433800","7434640"," Those are generational."
"7436140","7437360"," Stock buying opportunities."
"7437960","7438860"," They don't happen often. "
"7440400","7441360"," And so you want to keep."
"7442260","7443760"," You want to buy that stock, right?"
"7444020","7446440"," You know, I know that everybody wants to buy that split."
"7448180","7452280"," So you will more than likely see that stock go crazy. "
"7453560","7454840"," It's like a Google right now."
"7460630","7463830"," So yeah, you'll see you'll see Google go to 3000 guaranteed."
"7465430","7467890"," So it's just a matter of buying calls off the bell tomorrow. "
"7469410","7470690"," Literally more than likely."
"7471750","7474070"," You'll see Google at 3000 before you know it."
"7476530","7478890"," And if you're poor, just buy call spreads. "
"7479930","7480770"," It's going to get run up."
"7481390","7483230"," There ain't nothing anybody can do about it."
"7484990","7487150"," There ain't no market maker that can do anything about it. "
"7490420","7492220"," You guys want to see Google real quick?"
"7492920","7494520"," Look at Google after hours."
"7494700","7495560"," This is going to go crazy."
"7502170","7504770"," I don't know if you guys have traded mini stock splits. "
"7505010","7505430"," If you have."
"7510930","7516430"," It's a really weird paradigm too, because you'll get scared into selling your calls."
"7516910","7519790"," If they're farther dated out, don't fucking sell them. "
"7519810","7520310"," You just hold them."
"7520790","7522470"," Or at least that's been my experience."
"7523570","7525270"," Like the short dated stuff, sell them. "
"7525270","7527350"," But the long dated stuff like that."
"7527490","7529070"," They go to the roof."
"7529910","7530970"," Like roof. "
"7533410","7538810"," Anything that was bought prior to your prior."
"7539190","7542950"," The interest kick is the premium kick is just stupid."
"7544210","7545550"," It's stupid. "
"7556720","7558820"," So 2967, right?"
"7560680","7564800"," 2967, all-time highs is 3037."
"7565560","7568200"," You'll probably see at least 3,000 buy open tomorrow."
"7569700","7572180"," It wouldn't surprise me to see it trade even higher. "
"7573200","7576320"," I think all-time highs is easy on Google."
"7576720","7578560"," You figure it was at 20 to one stock split."
"7579180","7580160"," They're just going to run it up. "
"7580760","7581940"," They're going to run it up."
"7582080","7582720"," That's what's going to happen."
"7583680","7586780"," Yeah, if you're in Google specific calls, congratulations. "
"7588200","7589460"," Let it out, congratulations."
"7590700","7594180"," You will see interest tomorrow in calls."
"7598350","7599230"," Yeah, good job. "
"7600630","7601310"," All right."

"7619230","7620550"," We'll check again tomorrow."
"7620830","7625250"," If you don't see me at any point in the next couple of days, it's because I have a storm"
"7625250","7625870"," coming through."
"7626350","7628130"," I could possibly lose power this week. "
"7629610","7634950"," If I lose power and don't lose internet, I can probably get back on in some capacity."
"7635910","7640690"," I do have an inverted generator, but I do use it to run."
"7641510","7645090"," Like I use it to run a furnace and I use it to run refrigeration. "
"7645350","7648110"," That kind of stuff in just basic internet."
"7648330","7649690"," So I don't know how much I can get on."
"7650030","7651730"," But I do have a major storm coming through. "
"7652070","7654810"," I do have calls out there and puts out there."
"7654890","7656390"," So I'm kind of scared at front."
"7657070","7657690"," Look at this. "
"7657790","7658110"," This is wild."

"7685020","7686020"," We ended up trading it up. "
"7686460","7688960"," We took the viewpoint that we're going to trade up into the bell."
"7690040","7695780"," We chose correctly and made some fat cash rather than standing around all day long and watching and"
"7695780","7697080"," puts just burn."
"7698140","7699740"," You guys all have a wonderful afternoon. "
"7699940","7701600"," Catch you on tomorrow in the morning."
"7707170","7707630"," Hey, Joe."
"7707930","7710150"," I'll give you a call today. "
"7711890","7713090"," Yeah, I have calls open and spy."
"7714450","7715350"," Of course I do."
"7715810","7716710"," We're going to get up tomorrow. "
"7717570","7719130"," Yeah, the impact of Google."
"7719510","7720390"," Well, in my view, we do."
"7720970","7724890"," The impact of Google tomorrow is going to be far reaching. "
"7726070","7726950"," You've got Amazon."
"7726950","7730150"," Here's another heads up to any of you guys out there, OK?"
"7730870","7732390"," If Google is splitting, right?"
"7733070","7738090"," I guarantee that Amazon will see that question, right?"
"7738270","7741650"," That we'll see that bump on the chance."
"7742290","7746450"," You'll see people saying, oh, is Amazon going to split?"
"7746770","7750890"," You'll see people trade Amazon up just in case it splits. "
"7752130","7752730"," Guaranteed."
"7753070","7754950"," Guaranteed you see the queues gap tomorrow."
"7756490","7759970"," Guaranteed you see Amazon trade way higher. "
"7760410","7762070"," Way, way, way, way higher, right?"
"7764870","7768210"," It's just like the Apple Tesla split."
"7768610","7770290"," It doesn't matter if it happens or not."
"7770530","7771330"," They're going to trade it up. "
"7774100","7779120"," You guys, did you guys even think about the Amazon trade on the Google trade?"
"7784020","7787940"," Does anybody think about the implications on Amazon possibly?"
"7787940","7788540"," Trading higher?"
"7793300","7796020"," Yeah, Amazon's going to trade higher just based on that."
"7796400","7797900"," You're going to have Google trading higher."
"7797940","7799320"," You're going to have Amazon trading higher. "
"7799320","7800960"," There's no way this market falls with that."
"7807260","7809600"," Trust me, if you're in Amazon calls, congratulations."
"7811280","7815520"," You guys all have a wonderful evening, and I will check back in with you tomorrow at the open. "
"7821090","7823070"," I'm listening to some of you guys are staying here."
"7823070","7828050"," Just fucking streamlabs, sex balls."
"7829930","7837860"," Yeah, Amazon's a good sister trade. "
"7840220","7844400"," And Amazon should not stop trading."
"7845620","7853540"," Amazon should continue to trade until they're here, based on just the off chance that they split."
"7860160","7860600"," Damn. "
"7862500","7864000"," It's going to be a good couple days."
"7865620","7870040"," Yeah, you know, it's a, well, I, they'll probably still print."
"7874640","7876100"," AMD is moving as well. "
"7876960","7878540"," Yeah, the stock splits going to be an Amazon."
"7878720","7879800"," That's what everybody's going to talk about."
"7879880","7880500"," I guarantee it. "
"7880880","7884840"," I guarantee you on Twitter tonight and tomorrow, all you're going to hear is Amazon will be"
"7884840","7887180"," splitting soon on their ER, guaranteed."
"7888880","7889540"," Guaranteed you."
"7889680","7890980"," I guarantee you heard it here first. "
"7892660","7894080"," You guys all have a wonderful night."
"7894780","7895260"," Take it easy."
"7895460","7895820"," Mero. "
"7895960","7896380"," Take his brother."
"7898040","7898520"," Joey."
"7898520","7898960"," Take it easy. "
"7899100","7899360"," My brother."
"7900260","7900740"," Desperado."
"7901300","7901780"," Dreyus. "
"7902000","7902120"," Devin."
"7903400","7903560"," Mary."
"7907060","7907780"," Oh, really?"
"7908040","7909440"," Did Starbucks really eat shit?"
"7910740","7912000"," Are you shitting me?"
"7921480","7922160"," There to eat shit. "
"7922160","7923580"," Oh, Starbucks."
"7924400","7925720"," What is wrong with you?"
"7928360","7928900"," Starbucks."
"7931660","7933480"," Can't catch a break Starbucks. "
"7936520","7937920"," Can't catch a break."
"7938900","7939680"," Good night, son."
"7946450","7948650"," Does this whack the bear view?"
"7949090","7950210"," No, we always go up and down. "
"7950810","7952770"," You guys got to know that we still go up and down."
"7953390","7955390"," We still go up and down."
"7956490","7958410"," So I would expect that we trade higher. "
"7959010","7960290"," And then we trade lower, right?"
"7960630","7961410"," That typically happens."
"7961690","7963070"," The apple calls that I had."
"7963970","7966470"," Trying to remember when they cooled off. "
"7968510","7969710"," I'm going to have to look and see."
"7970170","7972770"," I want to go back and look and see what apple calls cooled off."
"7974710","7980370"," But no, I'll still hold my puts because if you're trading, if you're day trading the call side,"
"7980590","7980650"," right?"
"7981410","7983670"," And you're protecting yourself along the way. "
"7983670","7985910"," It's just a cost of doing business."
"7987110","7990890"," You have to have a cost of doing business when you trade a market."
"7991110","7995950"," If you are trading just puts or just calls, you are going to get burned. "
"7996770","7997070"," You promise."
"7998690","7999210"," Promise."
"8000410","8002610"," Promise, promise, promise, promise, promise, promise. "
"8004030","8004550"," Okay."
"8004950","8011010"," So when you come into areas where you think or where there should be a rejection, it's not bad to"
"8011010","8013050"," be saying, I'm going to buy myself protection here."
"8013410","8014590"," There's nothing wrong with that. "
"8014990","8019490"," I would trust you more than someone saying, I'm just long or I'm just short."
"8021350","8021830"," Okay."
"8022090","8026190"," So you take that and you take the, you put on dated puts in the money. "
"8029710","8031550"," You get more aggressive with them."
"8031690","8035130"," If we turn and you trade the market, that's to the right of you."
"8035310","8037250"," If it's up, you keep buying yourself calls. "
"8037250","8038590"," Keep making money."
"8038990","8040610"," Keep holding those spy puts."
"8041190","8045730"," You'll eventually pay for your spy puts and then be printing green, right?"
