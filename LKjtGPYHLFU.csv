"1061220","1066300"," But oftentimes you'll see this right here becomes a bull trap bulls come up here They're trapped in"

"1152750","1160390"," And i'm like mmm we're going to 430 45 cents seems a little expensive They're going to burn that"
"1160390","1166090"," down at one point and it's a good reference point for the day See where everything is that was that"
"1166090","1173220"," thing was that a spy was in a dollar 20 yesterday into the bell or into the Into the belly"
"1173220","1174320"," or into the belly yesterday."
"1174460","1175660"," I should have closed those out there. "
"1175820","1179900"," They would have been a dollar 30 So we'll see here if this is a bull trap you have one"

"1962710","1974050"," it's pinning the market into opx the point being that You're not going to get You're"
"1974050","1980530"," not going to get uh You know the scape velocity called it right and then as we trade low and"

"2032070","2034230"," We're gonna fucking blast south, right?"
"2034850","2040670"," It's it's it's it's prudent for you to protect yourself and put some hedging on and hold it into"

"2068489","2069989"," We're close to 4,000, right?"
"2070409","2076389"," So these banks that are down below here They have to protect their investment So they're going to"
"2076389","2085050"," hold these puts into the FMC now with all that said with all that said With all that said if"
"2085050","2092409"," they're if or as we head towards this right those puts do lose Their value right theta burn kicks"
"2092409","2099750"," in they lose their their their their Intrinsic value of these options And so if we see increased"

"2975840","2980420"," So when we went like friday when we tagged it down below She's like, you know, she's like I bought"
"2980420","2984920"," every time we tagged that I just bought out OTM calls and they printed every three times So far she"
"2984920","2990120"," said and my point to her was that I though I do agree with buying calls down here And we"
"2990120","2996520"," are buying calls down here Uh when we do hit the market breath indicator that it's not a 100"
"2996520","3004020"," percent uh trade And my also my point down here is uh that if you're going to Take a trade"
"3004020","3009720"," every month and a half two months three months You want to ensure that it prints no matter what"
"3009720","3013280"," Especially if you're full porting if you're going in like a hundred thousand dollars three hundred"
"3013280","3018480"," thousand dollars You just want that exact or not exact but you want to make sure they're print Uh,"
"3018540","3022780"," so you could take a three month out call spread down here You could you can play zero dates down"
"3022780","3022940"," here. "
"3023020","3027400"," There's nothing saying you can't play zero dates down here But we have but if you look in the past"
"3027400","3033020"," whenever we hit down here Sometimes they don't print sometimes we still roll the market over"
"3033020","3037960"," Sometimes you don't get the money that you want it to get so this trade is still more geared"
"3037960","3041800"," towards Uh new traders that fuck up trades, right?"
"3042060","3047600"," So you want to build in So you want to build in The trade so that when they take it"
"3047600","3053460"," and they have a high confidence That it's going to print that they know that every time it's going"
"3053460","3058040"," to print Now with that being said we still have volatility on the horizon, right?"
"3058180","3063800"," So we tagged down below Mbi came straight down and the market just drained, right?"
"3064460","3068840"," We also though still have Uh fmc on the fourth."
"3069300","3076060"," This is this lingering This lingering event that's down here Oftentimes when we bounce down here,"
"3076060","3080560"," you'll start to see violent moves and then a move higher Right?"
"3081000","3083740"," And so just for me taking this trade with new traders."
"3083980","3089580"," This isn't like a challenge like um I'm going to show you that I can make 10 great trades. "
"3089960","3099960"," This is I we can we or the um The The Whatever"
"3099960","3104860"," you call it there the the brokerage that we're using I'd already made five good trades on it,"
"3104960","3105020"," right?"
"3105280","3110400"," So it's not about me bragging saying oh, yeah, I can make 10 great trades Uh, it's not about that."
"3110520","3115320"," It's about a new trader that makes lots of mistakes saying to them Look when we get down here put"
"3115320","3121180"," a safe trade on and just let it run Pull port that trade and then only piss your piss your"
"3121180","3126020"," money away and zero dates with a small part of your account Because oftentimes they get these dms"
"3126020","3127680"," and people that say hey cap."
"3127720","3132560"," I blew up my fucking account You got I mean that might not be something serious for you But for"
"3132560","3137040"," a lot of a lot of investors in traders it is you might have a half a million dollars But"
"3137040","3143480"," some traders they have 20,000 they got 30,000 or they're trading their bank account from uh a job,"
"3143540","3143860"," right?"
"3144060","3148780"," They're making 500 bucks a week 1,000 bucks a week 2,000 bucks a week they got I don't"
"3148780","3152060"," know bills they're paying and whatever and they're trying to get a leg up. "
"3152240","3158220"," They're not they're not you they're not me so And they get bad advice on the internet So it's not"
"3158220","3165060"," that this doesn't work Mary Mary is a great point, but at the same time If Mary's playing with an"
"3165060","3169280"," account that's a hundred thousand dollars, that's different than Mary throwing a thousand bucks"
"3169280","3170560"," down here every time, right?"
"3170920","3176080"," Mary can go to lose a thousand dollars down here on OTM calls Once we hit the market for a"
"3176080","3181400"," thin indicator, but some people can't like new traders and she Her point is 100 ballot."
"3181700","3184120"," I agree with her point Uh, but I have that responsibility."
"3184200","3188820"," It's a little bit different Is that when you get down to these levels down here, you're still"
"3188820","3194860"," looking to manage the trade You're still looking for is this actual bottom We we talked back here"
"3194860","3198960"," about saying you could throw three months on them to ensure that they print to bypass all this"
"3198960","3204020"," volatility But at the same time when we're down here Uh when we're down here, you also want to take"
"3204020","3210240"," an effect other considerations as to hey should I be buying it here Down on this on this left hand"
"3210240","3210500"," side. "
"3210660","3213240"," We talked about this this close Buying in here."
"3213320","3217940"," We talked about buying it here and buying it here as well All three of these days you said, hey,"
"3218240","3221700"," any matter of fact yesterday I posted on tour I said This is a place where you can buy some"
"3221700","3227540"," call spreads and you just close your computer Put a limit sell on it and you come back to it."
"3227660","3232840"," So you've had three opportunities at this point To buy that but myself personally no matter where"
"3232840","3233580"," we go higher. "
"3233920","3243780"," I still think we we revert back down towards uh Towards uh where close the hair Down"
"3243780","3250600"," towards this 405 heading into or near it right down into for into May 4th, so I would say be"
"3250600","3256180"," ready for this I know that if there's that we can that we can slingshot up during this time period"
"3256180","3262300"," Due to puts losing their value, but somewhere down in here if I can get somewhere down in here I'll"
"3262300","3270880"," take that trade as we get closer Now with all that being said this morning You know if I'm trained"
"3270880","3276480"," so I trade I'm going to make this trade with you guys But then I make this trade myself in"
"3276480","3282080"," my own account So if I'm going to if I'm going to full port like a half million dollars or"
"3282080","3288100"," a hundred thousand dollars or something That's my risk right so that so when I place that trade I"
"3288100","3294040"," have my own List of I need to hit these certain metrics so that I can guarantee they print."
"3294580","3299360"," I don't want to come back Like when I'm looking at this FOMC meeting over here, right?"
"3300480","3305600"," And we talked about this in the past two where so we'll miss some great trades within taking this"
"3305600","3306200"," trade, right?"
"3306540","3311280"," You might miss an entire trade cycle that this can take place where you have that didn't pull the"
"3311280","3316180"," trigger and I miss the entire trade And the reason I say that is because When I when I take"
"3316180","3323840"," this trade right I don't want to lose Ever like I want it to be a hundred percent trade and"
"3323840","3330100"," typically it's a trade where I win typically like 29 out of 30 times Following my rules."
"3330100","3335600"," It's 29 out of 30 like I might miss one It's the dumb down trade. "
"3335760","3341500"," It's the one that I placed the bet and I know it's printing So even though we have this market"
"3341500","3342760"," breath sell-off down here."
"3342880","3347220"," We hit the the MBI sure I'll trade a thousand bucks here I'll trade 10,000 bucks here."
"3347320","3355040"," I'll trade 20 if it starts getting crazy, but for my rules that I have I'm looking for I'm looking"
"3355040","3362340"," for this lower bound and a key point in this Is if you look at Is if you look at"
"3362340","3370240"," if you back test this trade There are moments where it will not print for you There are moments"
"3370240","3375040"," where market makers know that the market is buying calls down here, right?"
"3375780","3380280"," The market makers know that banks are buying them down here And thinking they're gonna print and"
"3380280","3381860"," then they they still drop it. "
"3382020","3389240"," Let's say they're month out calls and they won't print them Until that month expires So you have to"
"3389240","3394540"," be careful when you're when taking this trade You're trying to dumb it down for a trader for a new"
"3394540","3400380"," investor this trade You know that this trade we're trying to do here is not for the the the the"
"3400380","3404460"," savvy investor or Someone with lots of experience day trading."
"3404540","3411980"," This is for a new trader We talked about how we talked we talked about how We talked about in"
"3411980","3418200"," the for in the past we talked about how You make one great trade or three great trades or five"
"3418200","3423580"," great trades Then you go on this this horrible run of losing all of your money And so we want"
"3423580","3429040"," this to work every time you want to be able to make this trade In confidence knowing no matter what"
"3429040","3435580"," it's gonna print And so we know along with the market breath indicator being down that down below"
"3435580","3442200"," here heading into into the Fourth that there's a high chance of a magnet down in here pulling us"
"3442200","3445440"," down There's not a high chance of a magnet pulling us below it."
"3445700","3451760"," There's no high chance See if we can get this back over here There's no high chance right now that"
"3451760","3459780"," I can see Of not we hit 400 start, you know, selling down to 380 360 and those kind of"
"3459780","3460000"," numbers. "
"3460120","3466840"," I don't see that But I do see a pulled a drag down as we head down Into that date."
"3467040","3471600"," So even with us being being this low at 413 I don't think this is the lowest low that you've"
"3471600","3478460"," seen at this point I think you do see A lower low heading into if not 405 maybe it's 410"
"3478940","3480340"," Or maybe it's 410 down here."
"3480420","3485320"," We don't get quite down in this moment But if we get that capitulation moment, right that that last"
"3486000","3490040"," capitulation, I'll buy that bottom and I'll close my computer, right?"
"3492020","3493140"," I'll close it. "
"3493180","3499980"," I'm gonna go full port into that trade A little bit of selling off right now in the spy See"
"3499980","3510550"," if these buyers are still down in here To be an add to that trade And"
"3510550","3518940"," you'll see these buyers right here at 422 50 We'll see if they hold here or not or if we"
"3518940","3586420"," trade lower I"
"3586420","3587600"," just started buying some more calls."
"3587620","3602440"," I bought some 433s for expiry on monday Next"

"3612350","3617200"," here You got the reversal, right?"
"3617380","3623900"," We have the one pump two pump reversal down Bears don't or bears want to break this level here"
"3623900","3633800"," We'll see if the bears take charge today or not See here And then down below at 419"
"3634640","3650920"," So it says for or 490 will write down 4 1950 is where the next round of buyers are Right"
"3650920","3659180"," down below Markets selling off baby buyers at 422 being blasted throw it up lasted through 422 50"

"3666720","3668600"," here This is bad news."
"3668840","3676700"," My stops will be somewhere down around this foreign Foreign for 19 flat for 1950 But otherwise I"
"3676700","3682360"," just bought some more here and I'll buy some more down here for a price target of 433 heading into"

"3689680","3695580"," a 433 price target right up in here that I got buying into Right now and we'll see if we"
"3695580","3707750"," can get this going here Hold on here Yeah,"
"3707810","3717970"," so the timing Joe harper I'm looking to place that trade closer to uh the fourth Plus"

"3723550","3729090"," pointed out to watch this the uh that video the other day So I did watch it on the selling"
"3729090","3738870"," of vlon must shares they calculated it down to 750 Uh, oh they they they tried to track it down"
"3738870","3746370"," to a price target of 750 But they hadn't accounted for banks that uh that that uh helped out with"
"3746370","3751770"," the deal And so there was some information that came out two days ago About some banks that he was"

"3762230","3768190"," Yeah, I think it's that 0.5. I think that's where we are Puts aren't even printing that much."
"3768410","3769150"," No, I closed mine."

"3799270","3810430"," still printed 300 percent And I'm rep mine rep uh 300 or 400 at one point at 415 yesterday When"
"3810430","3817710"," we buying calls for the cold bed puts up 70 percent So here about some dirty 405s How much leeway"
"3817710","3821530"," under 419 would you allow like a few percent?"
"3823010","3831290"," um, let me see I don't if we get below 420 wink if we you get below If you'd get"
"3831290","3836590"," below this 420 number, uh, this isn't the ball trigger, but this is a salva news trigger."
"3836810","3846850"," This is uh For I call this I'd say anything below like four For for an anything below 419 uh"
"3846850","3854670"," becomes very bad it becomes it turns into instead of Instead of a dip by a dip by a dip"
"3854670","3860610"," by it turns into boom sell it A rejection and we start heading lower into the close on friday"
"3861170","3867510"," That's what it turns into this could get ugly into the bell Uh, if we rega if we break Uh,"
"3867710","3868970"," this 419 down here. "
"3869030","3875190"," We do or 420 if we break this 420 It gets real ugly real fast and down here I would"
"3875190","3880210"," so I would switch to puts if we broke through and we rejected right here and would be buy more"
"3880210","3886830"," puts I'd cut the calls loose all this dip by in here Uh, I would I would cut these loose"
"3886830","3896720"," for a loss and then take up the up put side down My calls of 419 did you"
"3896720","3897360"," look at Amazon?"
"3897440","3901100"," Yes, there's strong supports somewhere Let's look at Amazon."
"3901560","3909200"," We'll bring up Amazon real quick for you See what you guys want to know about here."
"3909300","3925960"," We'll load up Amazon We'll"
"3925960","3927520"," load up a few hours here. "
"3927760","3939760"," We'll have three hours of Amazon Come back over here for you to watch Let's"
"3939760","3949770"," see it right down here that 419 420 We can get it right here And this right"
"3949770","3960790"," here is the sell the world is down here at this 450 419 50 is sell the world So that"
"3960790","3966610"," is look what you're looking for if you see the breakdown here of 419 50 12 and then it gets"
"3966610","3976060"," it gets nasty if you wanted a price target of a break of 420 you're gonna be looking for 409"
"3976760","3986810"," 100 point move down believe it or not and this we would go down here into the belt gonna"
"3986810","4013320"," load up Amazon Okay"
"4014860","4019420"," So on Amazon right we talked about Hit that price target."
"4019720","4019780"," Yes."
"4020040","4027220"," This is from you guys know about we charted this out We expected a sell off at Amazon, right We"
"4027220","4033700"," expected a lift up high we didn't quite get up here But we did sell down below the south futures"
"4033700","4039820"," probing new lows down about one and a half percent 42 21 in the s&p minis Dow is down"
"4039820","4047800"," about 355 points 172 point give back in the NASDAQ after the big rally you saw in t yesterday's us"
"4047800","4052980"," cash equity close European equity markets holding on to gains of about a half a percent the cat"
"4052980","4061280"," karan and eight tenths of a percent in the DAX So as he broke below this this support here right"
"4061280","4068420"," 2600 was large support for Amazon Talked about this yes or last week. "
"4068660","4075120"," I think at some point We said you want to see this 2600 be held if we didn't see 2600"
"4075120","4082100"," held That if there's a chasm right I think uh mayhem for markets said something yesterday About"
"4082100","4089980"," what are the price targets down below if these levels are not held We'll take a look at those this"
"4089980","4099979"," morning and see how far down we can go And this is where the"
"4099979","4105819"," concern is right you have a small node over here You can see it right here small node So we"
"4105819","4122160"," spent some time on Amazon clear this out here So"
"4122160","4128359"," we spent some time down below here at this 24 64 23 through 39 Right when you spend time down"
"4128359","4134240"," here, there's some support here, but this is not major support Major support is literally down"
"4134240","4140060"," below at that 2000 level So keep an eye on these as we look at book map to see where"
"4140060","4142180"," major Support is down here."
"4142640","4146020"," And so that becomes the question right where and where are we trading right now?"
"4146020","4155040"," 25 53 right which is slightly above right 100 100 points above This this 24 64 level right this"
"4155040","4161080"," light support believe it or not This is light support So what do you expect to happen in the coming"
"4161080","4165479"," weeks would be for some consolidation down in this zone?"
"4165840","4173080"," But for support to still remain at this 2600 So you're going to expect to see Some kind of you're"
"4173080","4177720"," going to if you're a bull you want to be seeing some kind of some kind of sideways action here"
"4177720","4183000"," And then a trade higher at some point right this correction that's going on down below you want to"
"4183000","4188979"," see a beat You can't get bullish on Amazon until it breaks above this this negative channel that"
"4188979","4194440"," has now been created Right at the same time you don't want to see this break So with that being"
"4194440","4199540"," said if you're a bull you don't want to see a break for where we are of 23 39 And"
"4199540","4207220"," you would expect at some point once twice Every month or two that we will trade down here to this"
"4207220","4215600"," 24 64 23 39 so you can grab a dip by to take higher Now this 2600 right as if"
"4215600","4223200"," you're a bull you want to see that be recaptured right you want to see 2600 Be recaptured at some"
"4223200","4223480"," point."
"4223820","4229720"," This isn't full bull, but this is definitely a step in the right direction Is this this major trend"
"4229720","4229960"," line?"
"4230220","4234920"," You don't want to see this trend line get rejected You don't want to see us seeking new lows"
"4234920","4237920"," because this is a weak support down here, right?"
"4238460","4242500"," You don't mind if it if it consolidates in here for a plug higher. "
"4242960","4249020"," You don't mind if it consolidates in here You don't mind if it consolidates down in here fails"
"4249500","4254720"," Right takes one or at least two times to get up in there right double bottom triple bottom And then"
"4254720","4260480"," it finally gets above here, but your work's not done as a bull even if you do make this move"
"4260480","4266040"," higher And the reason being of course is that you're now in this in this corrective channel Right"

"4706220","4713920"," high day for amazon the market goes up This is all looking like a short at some point Uh, even"
"4713920","4721740"," if it takes into september October December even if we have great market days uh, my my thought"
"4721740","4729920"," process is that At some point, you know, my view on the market is overall Negative in the next one"
"4729920","4737560"," to three years Um, so this is not a good sign for amazon in the long term Um, like macro"
"4737560","4738980"," one year outlook on amazon."
"4739240","4745800"," I'm not not too bullish on amazon right now Uh, that doesn't even look straight up hotter points"
"4745800","4752060"," 300 points 200 points anything like that Uh, but I think in the long run When you look at amazon"
"4752060","4761900"," over the course of the year My price target stands down here believe it or"
"4761900","4771820"," not 2000 1600 I'm not lying like"
"4771820","4775660"," this is the price this is the price target down here, but I don't think we get there right now"
"4776260","4785930"," I think this takes like um Uh, you could say it's either gonna take nine months or three years, but"
"4785930","4795500"," one way or another somehow some way We'll leave this down here One way or another some I don't"
"4795500","4795980"," think it's today. "

"4808220","4815290"," I got no qualms of this trading up here, but Not a longer term a longer view On a longer"
"4815290","4821410"," view would be something no matter where this comes You know, you're gonna see some kind of nonsense"
"4821410","4826450"," like this some kind of a false breakout These aren't really working for right here."
"4826450","4826850"," Eventually."
"4827110","4831310"," It's gonna sell off Eventually come up here. "

"4849270","4859010"," it's still a place to hide for the market Definitely this ain't done This is not done Not"
"4859010","4865250"," with this break of 2600 that was some something breaking this right here One two boom break lower."

"4899540","4906720"," last spot for the bulls to make a stand if they can't get this stand for window dressing today At"
"4906720","4908100"," 4 1960. "
"4908600","4913340"," You're going to expect A sell-off into the bell today."

"4919040","4923840"," this way and I said catch it throwing at the wall And that's the window dressing for today."
"4924240","4932580"," So this is the last place down below here 4 1950 should be the last place for bulls to hide. "

"5636840","5642800"," leaves the market over here Uh, so that's my take on the captain's uh trade is down here somewhere"
"5642800","5647980"," more than likely on the on the third or the fourth somewhere in here We'll place this trade."
"5648320","5653440"," It'll be a bloodbath down in here And uh, you know, you'll you'll have panic in the streets and"
"5653440","5657780"," you'll have bears telling you that we're going uh 360 And we might go to 360, but it doesn't really"
"5657780","5663620"," matter The only thing that matters is that the risk is gone and that the banks have to buy the"
"5663620","5672180"," dip down here So just be conscious of that on a larger time frame of the pull higher With the"
"5672180","5679820"," expiration of like literally 75 of the puts of the market 75 percent it's like 20 percent today"
"5680600","5683220"," Like literally it's like 25 20 percent today. "
"5683380","5692320"," It's like 20 percent on monday Right i kid you not and then like 30 percent on the fourth Like"
"5692320","5698220"," all of the puts of the market And then I think on the sixth is like another 20 percent or"
"5698220","5707320"," something the giant put positions Heading into uh, the fourth and slightly into the sixth Uh, you"
"5707320","5712480"," should get a second pump From that vanarelli if we get a vanarelli on the fourth you should see"
"5712480","5717680"," like one pump and at the end of the day you'll see another pump Um, and hopefully will it break"
"5717680","5717880"," out."
"5718020","5723300"," I don't think you break out of this, but that'd be a nice trade down here 400 to 440 or"
"5723300","5727860"," so Maybe you get to 440 up here and then we reverse course again and start heading back down"
"5728700","5747140"," Somewhere in there So you"
"5747140","5756780"," guys are saying Vicks back back above 30 fixed port spx 42412 Cues going to bounce then it's here"
"5756780","5763060"," and it's had lower bounce here fixed back over 30 possible inverted head and shoulders Uh, apple"
"5763060","5763880"," spot for the week."
"5764540","5769360"," Spire critical area Uh, can we see book map here you got to bounce right in here just in place"
"5772290","5776770"," Got a beautiful bounce right down below right here Right beautiful bounce. "
"5777030","5786840"," We'll see if this holds Spire critical area Could say return to another black friday, uh"
"5787420","5789480"," Paul troy's asking I mean I answered that earlier."
"5789740","5793140"," They thought it would happen at 6 a.m Can we get a black friday?"
"5794620","5804420"," We can get it back black friday We normally though We'll look at it."
"5804520","5808240"," We'll look at a black friday, okay Can we get a black friday?"
"5808540","5808760"," Yes. "
"5808900","5818550"," We can't well we're in it's pain paul Paul has a fair question like will we get a black"
"5818550","5828710"," friday here Uh, it's possible what I don't like about the black friday here This"
"5828710","5836630"," isn't the only example so Two things on a black friday you'd normally get it on like a uh, you'd"
"5836630","5846020"," normally get it back here in january You'd roll it over and here you would have broken down much"
"5846020","5854940"," far much worse than 400 uh, but we bounced another thing that I don't like about a black friday is"
"5855600","5862180"," Normally when you get the black friday When you get that like 50 move 36 to 50 move down You'd"
"5862180","5869260"," normally trade it down You'd have a huge move higher than It would break down to that 30 to 50"
"5869260","5880560"," Uh, and even the most recent example if you were to look back on Same"
"5880560","5888480"," thing down here Um, you can see these in the past you guys can check any any black friday's Usually"
"5888480","5897340"," get that one huge move down Or you come back up And you expect it to stop right there Right,"
"5897340","5903480"," that's what the expectation would be something like this boom You come up right and we slam right"
"5903480","5909040"," through down here I guess the question becomes Uh, do you think that this can happen right we get"
"5909040","5913220"," this one to bounce and we break through here Uh, I don't see it."
"5913340","5917520"," I don't see what I don't My question is why would you take why would it take three months for"
"5917520","5917680"," it?"
"5918360","5921380"," Um Six months right or almost there right?"
"5922280","5930300"," Seems to order really 480 trading down to 400 Uh, 20 percent of the stock markets already gone from"
"5930300","5939420"," january And you want to have like another 30 move today Or monday, I don't know like you I oh"
"5939420","5943860"," you seem to always hear it down here You're like what we're down here you hear black monday black"
"5943860","5950760"," friday black thursday black monday black friday black thursday I don't think so I think that the"
"5950760","5957720"," greater chance is that Uh I think that the greater chances over the course of a year believe it or"
"5957720","5966340"," not Is normal distribution this looks like normal distribution You know how you'll have these"
"5966340","5972940"," violent moves here, but at the same time As you're coming down here, it's going to take time right"
"5972940","5979060"," to get down there It's going to take into september it's going to take into december I don't think"
"5979060","5984100"," that I think let's say we could get a black let's say we got a black friday today The same"
"5984100","5985160"," monday we got a black friday."
"5985180","5992440"," Let's say we do let's say we saw the world Let's see about 360 today Uh, what do you think"
"5992440","5993660"," happens if we go there today?"
"5994680","5995680"," Does anybody know?"
"5997640","6005420"," You get a fed put right down here somewhere 360 ish You get a fed put down here Uh, what's"
"6005420","6006640"," your case going to be at that point?"
"6008060","6012520"," Is your case that the economy is going to come back tomorrow or monday or something if we trade on"
"6012520","6018880"," 360 today and we get We get the black friday I'm trying to figure out where the where the where"
"6018880","6025440"," this plays into where we are in our economy If anything I think I think we trade it down to"
"6025440","6030820"," maybe 360 end of year Make a blast off run higher We could even do it. "
"6030960","6037520"," Uh, we could even do it on monday believe it or not And then roll it over later With the"
"6037520","6045020"," reality is, uh, I think it's more of a slow decline uh between now and end of year It's it's"
"6045020","6051880"," it's so we're in april right And back in january Right up here believe it or not."
"6051920","6057560"," I mean joe don't remember this chas remembers this we said You're going to get a decline down to"
"6057560","6065440"," 360 But it'll probably take nine months or a year and it's already been four months So I don't know"
"6065440","6070380"," do we get that do we get the uh Do we get the black swan event?"
"6070780","6078860"," I think they're fun to talk about The black swans that they're usually I usually like to see a"
"6078860","6084220"," black swan at like a top I remember in 2019 we kind of knew we were going to have that"
"6084220","6088620"," top two We were heading towards a recession some of you guys might know this some of you guys might"

"6118140","6125180"," We've shut down the world so That's where I would that's where I'd expect right a black swan type"
"6125180","6127620"," event this kind of a Quarterly sell-down. "
"6127920","6129260"," I think just continues."
"6129780","6137740"," I think it continues Into september at some point at least maybe even november or december Uh, but"
"6137740","6142900"," even with this overall bearishness that doesn't mean that you don't buy Uh these rips in here,"
"6142900","6147680"," right here at bull Uh, you can see where we have some great opportunities to buy this market as it"

"12059590","12064430"," recovering for a week Down for a month recovering for a week that kind of stuff Uh, you start it"
"12064430","12070010"," starts tacking on time for recovery unless the fed put comes in and we have this this, you know"

"12116270","12117850"," you might get down to like 390. "
"12118310","12123890"," I don't think we get that low More than likely the bottom is like 410 in a brief moment Hopefully"
"12123890","12128970"," it doesn't happen in after hours or a pre-market where you can't grab calls down in here But"

"13729790","13736650"," wind rate on The uh bull side of this of this indicator specifically So what does that mean to you"
"13736650","13738070"," as a bear if you're a bear out there?"
"13738070","13743610"," That means that you can trade this with a with a with a put spread you just can't rely upon"
"13743610","13748930"," it Uh and you need to rely upon these prints at least seven times for like 100 percent or better"
"13748930","13754870"," winds Can't be fucking around with 30 percent winds 10 percent winds and then not hit it big with"
"13754870","13761070"," one through 100 300 500 percent wind so this indicator specifically for me It works best regardless"
"13761070","13766870"," of where the market goes on the downside On the downside you get these capitulation moves and you"
"13766870","13771830"," know it's eventually coming back up I don't know why it doesn't work on the put side all the time"
"13772710","13779370"," I don't know why it doesn't fucking fall deep enough But i've noticed that it doesn't always uh"

"14558290","14558650"," Absolutely."
"14558950","14564250"," I agree with that statement Which I'm what type of spreads they usually do in the money how many"
"14564250","14566350"," strikes, etc Another good question. "
"14566590","14570950"," So Brad's asking how many Brad's asking a question what type of spreads they usually do in the"
"14570950","14578610"," money how many strikes, etc You will find that, uh, these are all fucking great questions again You"
"14578610","14584430"," will find that Uh, see I want you to see this right here."
"14587260","14598140"," So see this swoop right here You will find that calls Scratch"
"14598140","14607020"," all that You will find that at some point in capitulation every time if you watch every day If you"
"14607020","14616540"," watch every day You'll start to notice that even though we're going down So like we're going down"
"14616540","14622540"," here You might see a little bit of premium kick, but whenever we're going into capitulation mode"
"14622540","14627320"," like down here You'll see violence in the options chain."
"14627500","14634560"," You'll see like a dollar option call option going on like 10 cents or five cents But then you'll"
"14634560","14642360"," see a switch in that option start to gain in value even though we're still going down And that"
"14642360","14647420"," those are market makers pricing in the move before it happens Uh, so if you if you pay attention to"
"14647420","14652540"," options chains, you actually see the move before it takes place How you can check in these?"
"14653760","14656060"," Is you check higher you don't check in the money?"
"14657460","14658520"," You check up here. "
"14658640","14665840"," You'll see like a one penny option and it'll go to like 15 cents literally Like 15 cents and we"
"14665840","14671140"," haven't even made the turn yet And what they're doing is they're building in uh pocket and some"
"14671140","14671780"," money from you, right?"
"14672080","14677220"," They're already taking premium from you before you even know it before you even get there Uh, so"
"14677220","14681520"," when you start to see when people say you don't always see capitulation when you do see it It's a"
"14681520","14688100"," good place to buy right and that's that's part of that con that conversation Uh, so Brad's asking"
"14688100","14689880"," what type of spreads usually do in the money?"
"14690080","14690600"," How many strikes?"
"14691440","14695440"," So it's tough to give you the how many strike my point here is it's tough to give you the"
"14695440","14699160"," strike Because let's say we grab it at 10 cents."
"14699400","14702000"," It could be 10 cents or 75 cents in here, right?"
"14702660","14706300"," Uh, how do we have to go from 75 to $3 and 80 cents?"
"14706840","14709940"," Or we have to go from 15 cents to 30 cents, right?"
"14710660","14716320"," Uh, or not 30 but 45 cents as you make this turn so it's hard to to say when or"
"14716320","14722420"," how much the spread is going to be Uh, you focus mostly on the timing of the swing And what"
"14722420","14728840"," we're looking for Uh from now into what we're looking for now into next week is that swing you're"
"14728840","14738220"," looking for when do the options Start to gain some actual premium not fucking making money here Not"
"14738220","14748000"," this making money Not this not this But but you're looking for"
"14748000","14760770"," hold on here I'm a spasm right now So You're"
"14760770","14764810"," looking to buy your call spreads Hold on here."
"14765050","14770880"," Hold on Probably somewhere down in here, right?"
"14771360","14776520"," You buy your call spreads somewhere in here Maybe even this close And what you'll do is you will"
"14776520","14780420"," still keep going down and you literally i've had Joe and your wife's boyfriend tell me before"
"14780420","14784980"," they're like Hey cap We bought those calls you told us to buy and why are we going down and"
"14784980","14790980"," my calls are growing up in value And I say to them it's because we're making the swing right now"
