"900","2040"," Check one to you."
"2560","3640"," It's like we're alive."
"4580","5100"," Okay. "
"11810","12730"," That one too."
"19810","26420"," This is good."
"28600","38440"," Check one"
"38440","38680"," too. "
"49690","50970"," What's going on out there?"
"54160","55300"," Jared, how are you?"
"55560","56080"," Good to see you."
"56080","58600"," Yeah, I'm trying to make my way out of this."
"61520","62560"," Hold on here. "
"71980","73520"," This does matter."
"73900","82640"," And especially if you're a young trader, if you're a young trader, then this is for you."
"83520","87640"," This isn't every time, but you need to know about this. "
"87820","93000"," I can add a conversation with someone I think it was Sam."
"93240","93920"," I don't know if it was Sam."
"94040","103860"," It could have been somebody else, but we had a conversation about we got to stop everything here. "
"104100","114920"," So we're talking about being a young trader and being oblivious to"
"116360","118640"," basic shit, like just simple things."
"119000","122220"," Let me show you this one right here."
"123700","125640"," This is a fairly..."
"130290","131930"," We're going to simplify this though. "
"132830","135090"," So we're going to start with this right here."
"140320","142220"," It's fairly simple here."
"142560","142980"," Previous eye. "
"146600","148800"," Let me just turn that shit off."
"151700","153900"," So there's a fairly simple concept."
"154280","158900"," It's classic traditional charting, but it's still worthy to look at..."
"158900","161260"," I'm going to previous eye right here. "
"161540","162100"," It's today, right?"
"163280","170180"," You're always looking for you hear this called cup and handle and stuff, but truly know."
"170540","172880"," What you're really looking for here is this previous eye."
"173600","175080"," Time frame doesn't matter. "
"176680","178000"," So this is a one minute chart."
"178800","180160"," It was previous eye right here."
"180340","182660"," You're looking to see if that fails there. "
"184000","185280"," It's a previous eye."
"186060","188340"," Failure to get a new high, right?"
"189020","190800"," This would be a failure to get a new high."
"191560","195180"," And this shows weakness for bulls. "
"195580","196960"," You can do the same thing in the reverse too."
"197260","198720"," This works for bears as well."
"199460","209400"," Now if you get the new high, so if you if you don't have any of"
"209400","210680"," this yet here, okay?"
"211500","212760"," None of this is here yet. "
"215880","217660"," Okay, just pretend none of this is here."
"219220","220540"," Scratch all that out there."
"222020","226160"," What's important here is it's a one minute chart, right?"
"226880","229100"," So without seeing any of this shit over here. "
"230860","232260"," This is basic stuff, right?"
"232980","234260"," Get the previous eye right here."
"234420","237280"," You're looking to see if there's a failure to get this high."
"238360","242360"," This is showing the will of buyers waiting, right?"
"243080","243940"," Not good, right?"
"244160","245080"," You want to see a new high. "
"245160","246580"," If you're a bull, you want to see a new high."
"247900","249620"," So if you get the new high right here."
"252620","253840"," You don't want to short that. "
"255700","257420"," That's now I can go against you still."
"257500","259700"," We can still roll down and down this way."
"260240","264160"," But when you see the previous high get knocked out in a one minute chart, this is a one minute"
"264160","264600"," chart, right?"
"265360","266320"," It's showing strength. "
"267340","273620"," Now I can still back pull back, but you're going to expect an actual new high over here."
"274320","274840"," Does that make sense?"
"275500","277900"," The previous eye, you catch the new high."
"278360","281180"," Even if you get a pull back, the expectation is that you're going to go higher. "
"282380","286380"," And so the thumbnail this morning is about how to spot weakness."
"288500","290900"," Or just a pull back or strength, right?"
"291060","291780"," How do you spot it?"
"292320","295300"," And we can simplify this even more."
"296400","300940"," So I'm going to go to, let's see if I can go over here to this weebull chart here. "
"301520","303960"," I'm really going to bring up SPX or something."
"304200","304460"," Hold on."
"309760","313000"," These are fairly simple concepts, right?"
"313940","316020"," So here's SPX here. "
"317560","319580"," Now this is a 30 minute chart, right?"
"319800","323220"," Not a one minute chart, but you can see here you got the new high, right?"
"325680","331120"," And even on a 30 minute chart you see the failure to go back up and get the previous high"
"331120","331600"," right here."
"332720","334000"," Pretty simple stuff, right?"
"335640","337560"," Failure to get the new high right here."
"337620","338280"," What does that mean?"
"338900","341960"," It means if you get the failure to get the new high that we keep rolling down. "
"343740","350280"," Now a lot of you out there will try to say things like a lot of you out there will"
"350280","353300"," try to say things like, well, you should have known we're going all the way down here."
"355000","362180"," You'll see Elliott Waivers will say things like, you know, if this, then that, then if this, then"
"362180","362460"," that."
"362880","364960"," And that's not really good enough, right?"
"366320","367660"," You'll go against you. "
"367740","370880"," So you'll see things like an Elliott Waiver tell you, well, we're going all the way down here and"
"370880","373820"," then, you know, what ends up happening is we get the new high."
"374460","379060"," Then we just continue on to the right and you say, well, fuck, I hate that Elliott Waiver, right?"
"379840","381120"," I don't like that Elliott Waiver."
"381200","381740"," He got it wrong. "
"382780","388580"," The truth is that Elliott Waivers need to break out their erasers and stuff like that."
"388860","391160"," You need to know more than that as a trader."
"392840","394400"," As an investor and as a trader. "
"394720","397860"," So if you do see that failure you're going to expect more downside to come."
"397960","400960"," You see the failure again, more downside to come, right?"
"401680","407780"," Now, if we had gotten this previous high or if this had become a previous, we actually gone up"
"407780","407980"," here."
"408420","410840"," Got the new high, you'd actually expect a reversal to the upside. "
"410860","412060"," So it's important for you."
"413380","419240"," The key point here is that the matter who's out there telling you where we're going, you need to be"
"419240","423700"," able to identify if a reversal is shaping up or not."
"424000","425100"," Okay, that's the key point here. "
"425640","427080"," You don't really care where we're going."
"427220","432680"," You don't really care if we're ever going to reverse, if we're going to go up or down, right?"
"433060","439540"," So price action is king and not only is price action king, but if we're going to continue down,"
"439540","440340"," yeah, we continue down."
"440380","445500"," If we end up going up and it goes against your thesis, you follow that all the way up, right?"
"445800","452740"," So it's important for you as an investor and a trader not to pay attention to, hey, this is 4600"
"453500","455260"," and we're only pulling back here. "
"455420","456980"," Or only even pulling back here."
"457040","457960"," We could go lower, right?"
"459660","463580"," And it doesn't matter if you only called this or if you only called this or if you only called"
"463580","468720"," this, if we keep going down, you have to be able to chase that or be aware of that we're"
"468720","469760"," going to continue to go down."
"469940","476680"," If we're going to reverse to the upside here or here or even here, you need to be able to"
"476680","480280"," identify when that reversal is happening. "
"480280","482640"," So you're not on the wrong side of the trade, right?"
"482760","484920"," So it doesn't matter what you're calling from here."
"485520","489480"," Let's say you're like, hey, I'm calling, I don't know, 3600."
"491520","492880"," Calling for 3600. "
"494000","500820"," But if it reverses here, you can at least say I'm calling for 3600 and we start the reversal"
"500820","502040"," process over here."
"502920","505300"," You're not sitting here going yeah, it's still 3600."
"505420","505860"," Does that make sense?"
"506480","506960"," If it is a reversal. "
"507340","510360"," Same thing for the downside and that kind of stuff."
"510980","513480"," So we know kind of what to look for, right?"
"514140","518980"," And we're coming into this previous eye right here, right?"
"519559","525610"," So right now we're coming to that previous eye right now, right?"
"525850","527010"," You can see it right here."
"527970","529970"," You can see there's a previous eye right here. "
"532340","533840"," Now there's some rules here."
"534020","536920"," So we're just looking at a previous eye on a one-minute chart."
"537160","538500"," Now we're on a 30-minute chart, right?"
"539160","547660"," So just inside of here, if you're a seller or a bear, what do you want to see, right?"
"548400","552220"," You want to see a failure up here, right?"
"552840","555940"," You don't, as a matter of fact, this red could be brought down to right here. "
"557420","559840"," So there's a couple mechanics here."
"562540","564260"," If you're a bull, let's start with the bulls."
"564580","571100"," If you're a bull, you don't really, all you want to see is the touch of a new eye. "
"572360","573480"," You just want to see the touch."
"573660","574520"," You don't need to go any higher."
"574560","578280"," You just need to see the poke to head out and you're good to go as a bull. "
"580280","587320"," You can actually have a pullback here, but as long as you stay on trend, you're good to go too."
"588080","590100"," As long as you get that new high over here, okay?"
"590200","591560"," As long as you stay on trend up here."
"591640","592060"," Does that make sense?"
"593160","596840"," Now you're going to hear sellers out there on social media. "
"597140","598920"," You'll hear them in the news and all that kind of stuff."
"599460","603220"," And they're going to say things to you like, well all I really want is the pullback down here,"
"603360","603480"," right?"
"604620","608340"," You know, just close all this stuff up and we'll get back to what you want to do up here."
"608500","609360"," That's not real. "
"610160","617940"," That's a seller that wants to see the failure to cut, to get this new high, because he knows that"
"617940","620560"," whatever this pullback is likely going even lower."
"621360","621880"," Does that make sense?"
"623060","631460"," Now if you're a buyer and you get you're a buyer and you get that new high, you're actually"
"631460","635720"," triggered to start to look for a dip to buy to go higher."
"636680","640820"," Now if you failed here and start closing this gap, you're good, still on trend. "
"641300","646480"," But if you start to break down here without catching that previous eye, you're actually not trying"
"646480","647540"," to buy that dip there."
"647740","650440"," You're actually going to be very scared and careful."
"650440","654620"," And then you'll likely see this stuff down here get closed, believe it or not, at minimum. "
"655540","658520"," And more than likely, more bearishness."
"658980","662700"," So try to parse what you're hearing people say publicly."
"663380","669140"," When you're on social media, you hear people say why can't we just go back and close this stuff"
"669140","669720"," down here?"
"670700","678940"," They're not saying that because they're not saying that too because they want to close this stuff. "
"679620","684700"," They're saying that because they want to see the failure here so that we can get back down here and"
"684700","686360"," they're not getting torched, right?"
"687040","688320"," Does that make sense to you?"
"688680","690680"," This is a half our time frame, right?"
"691260","694440"," And we're going to switch back over here to this trigger screen."
"694860","697560"," It's a one minute time frame, similar kind of stuff, right?"
"698180","702800"," You want to see the previous eye get taken out, right?"
"702960","704480"," So we can smash up higher here."
"705220","705840"," Does that make sense?"
"706600","713940"," Now even if we fail, you're still going to expect that new high or that next previous high that we"
"713940","714560"," have to take out. "
"715780","718440"," So let's go back to this other chart over here."
"719660","722220"," And why is this important, right?"
"722520","724060"," The long term, why is this important?"
"724400","730920"," So if we get up here on trend, any pullback should be bought, right?"
"731220","734700"," Any pullback should actually be bought with strength to the upside."
"736140","737980"," So this is kind of a key place, right?"
"738080","742840"," You want to see this hold or at least this hold in a Monday or something like that so you"
"742840","744720"," can stay on trend and break this previous high. "
"744840","745560"," Why is that important?"
"746380","751960"," It's because once you knock out this previous eye right here, you have your pullback close out some"
"751960","754840"," of your crap down in here, right?"
"755320","761420"," You're then going to be targeting your next previous high up here and so on and so forth going back"
"761420","764620"," and taking out these previous highs."
"765280","769540"," Now let's say we do all this, so we get the new high over here, right?"
"769740","771720"," Yeah, we come back down close some of this crap out."
"771980","775400"," We start heading back up here and we actually fail this one. "
"776540","779460"," Just fail to get that previous that previous eye right here."
"779960","781220"," That's not good either."
"781380","783860"," Can we do some consolidation and stuff like that?"
"784240","790640"," So as long as the bulls are making new highs on these previous highs, their run is intact and"
"790640","794800"," should be considered intact unless trend gets broken. "
"795560","799680"," You're going to break down over here or something, that's fine, but until that happens, if you're"
"799680","805540"," able to get back there and make those new previous highs, the bull run is intact."
"807260","811480"," Okay, so into this weekend, right?"
"811940","818660"," In this day and into the beginning of next week, if you're a bull you don't want to see trend"
"818660","822860"," get broken before this previous high gets taken out."
"823500","833460"," That price target is basically 4400, roughly 4400 in here, so it's the key"
"833460","839860"," number up in here for bulls and they need to get this for that continuation upside even if there's"
"839860","841360"," a pullback, that's what they need. "
"841940","843000"," They have to have this."
"843140","845540"," The bulls don't get that, right?"
"845800","847000"," They start to fail to get this."
"847000","849640"," They start to do this breakdown bullshit. "
"850700","852680"," It's right back to business over here."
"853460","858480"," Okay, to downside moves and I'm going to show you this in another way right now with triggers."
"859400","868450"," So if we go back to this trigger screen right here, we go to a 30 minute chart we go"
"868450","871330"," back to a 30 minute chart right here on spoons, right?"
"872310","874750"," Remember we talked about staying on trend. "
"875430","877610"," This is that previous high back here."
"878610","880410"," You can see it right there, right?"
"880510","883590"," My cursor is right there while that gray line all the way back."
"887170","888870"," You want to see that, right?"
"889230","893130"," You want to see something else here that we stay on trend until it happens, right?"
"893890","898670"," You don't want to see any pullbacks, even if it's violent gets sold. "
"899190","899670"," Makes sense."
"900150","907610"," So this weekly trigger, this daily trigger, any of these pullbacks you want to see stay up there to"
"907610","908910"," take this bad boy out."
"909630","912290"," So it's going to be important for you as a bull. "
"912630","913870"," Some important things here."
"914090","916750"," One, get rid of this here since I've known the way."
"917650","920010"," One, you want to take off this previous high back here. "
"920170","920530"," You know that."
"920750","922570"," And number two, you want to stay on trend over here."
"924070","925190"," Apparently that's at 426. "
"927350","934810"," Okay, and if we take this out right now you're going to expect all this to go and continue to"
"934810","935410"," trade to the upside."
"935730","937370"," So crucial here, right?"
"938070","938770"," Crucial here."
"938870","940270"," There's something else I want to show you here too. "
"942030","944270"," Let's talk about this one right here."
"946510","949210"," I want you to think about this right here too."
"949570","950690"," We want you to watch this here. "
"950790","952390"," This is that 460, right?"
"953430","955230"," You got known sellers here."
"956150","958070"," You got known sellers here."
"959010","960690"," You got known sellers here. "
"961530","964430"," You got real weakness down here by bulls, right?"
"965230","967530"," And slam, pitulation trade."
"968550","971930"," And now we're coming back up to where known sellers are again."
"972770","974970"," So it's important here that you get that, right?"
"975730","981650"," And that you're able to hold this and consolidate and get some momentum underneath so that we can"
"981650","988090"," push higher here and take out this declining velocity here, this piece previous highs. "
"988090","990450"," So kind of a critical moment here."
"990550","991770"," A lot of mechanics going on."
"992210","994910"," Try to push up and beat these sellers here. "
"995450","998470"," Bears are still in control here."
"998630","1002650"," Whether you know that or not they're still in control of this market."
"1002870","1003690"," And you can see it right here. "
"1003770","1005410"," It's fairly simple to see, right?"
"1006010","1008670"," They sold here, sold here, sold here, sold on weakness."
"1009690","1014790"," And right now all they have to do is step back in, right?"
"1015130","1016110"," And they need to break underneath."
"1016110","1021770"," They need to break underneath that daily and weekly trigger and they're back in business again. "
"1021950","1022470"," Does that make sense?"
"1022630","1023869"," We talked about that last week."
"1024829","1027230"," And so they still are in charge here."
"1027349","1030430"," This is still their game and they can step in right here. "
"1030550","1032310"," And I assure you they're going to step back in."
"1032510","1034609"," I assure them when we come up here, right?"
"1034710","1038210"," They're going to step right in and try to slam this down at a minimum, do a hit and run,"
"1038369","1038770"," right?"
"1039390","1041050"," At a minimum, they're going to get that hit and run in here."
"1041369","1042190"," Take this out. "
"1042190","1044790"," So between now, today, Monday, right?"
"1044849","1047850"," You're going to be looking for some kind of weakness to sell into."
"1048190","1053450"," We're not quite weakness, but a back check on the daily, the weekly trigger, the hourly trigger."
"1053630","1054670"," Be aware of this, okay?"
"1055510","1056950"," This is likely to happen. "
"1057050","1060070"," There is likely to see some pressure selling coming in."
"1060530","1063830"," And we're going to find out if the bulls are real in here or not."
"1064930","1070510"," Okay, so pay close attention to this into Friday, Monday, that kind of stuff. "
"1070790","1079850"," Now, intraday for today, intraday for today, go to a 30 minute chart here or one minute chart."
"1081530","1084370"," We're looking pretty bullish in here for the rest of today."
"1085550","1090410"," And here's that red bar up here. "
"1090530","1091330"," We'll bring this over."
"1093630","1094890"," We're fairly close here, right?"
"1095690","1099270"," We're going to go back to that 30 minute and see if we can make sure that's it."
"1099270","1100050"," Yeah, it's right there. "
"1104330","1108030"," And we'll just snap a line there too, so you have it right there."
"1108870","1109030"," Okay?"
"1110250","1112530"," And we'll snap a line there for you."
"1112770","1113830"," So just for today, okay?"
"1114270","1116490"," Get this previous, this is just for me to trade. "
"1116750","1116890"," Hold on."
"1117570","1118830"," Just using that trade here."
"1120030","1124150"," So that this white line right here, right, is kind of Valhalla for bulls. "
"1125430","1125870"," They need that."
"1127050","1132710"," Technically, from a technical perspective, they need to tag above this, okay?"
"1134490","1135490"," 438 to 62."
"1136310","1137830"," Let me post that on Twitter really quick. "
"1139110","1139810"," Hold on here."
"1158500","1159620"," 438 to 62."
"1161240","1162340"," Oh, does something happen?"
"1165660","1167320"," Let me see if that actually worked or not. "
"1169680","1170420"," Turn that off."
"1170720","1173060"," So, it's kind of what you're looking for here, right?"
"1173380","1174180"," Does it have to happen?"
"1174180","1174520"," No."
"1175280","1176420"," Does it have to happen to spy?"
"1176920","1177300"," No. "
"1177520","1178680"," SPX would be nice."
"1179520","1182160"," ESSPX, either of those, I'd be very happy."
"1183120","1188900"," So if we tag above this line in SPX, if you're Ebola at least, right, that's what you're looking"
"1188900","1189240"," for. "
"1189300","1192240"," If you're a seller, you don't want to see that, right?"
"1192520","1196260"," Sellers do not want to see above this white line right here."
"1196400","1197880"," They want to hold this white line."
"1198560","1202660"," They want to roll this down before you ever get there and start the roll down. "
"1203120","1211820"," If you're a bear out there, you know, trying to time tops and stuff like that, can you time this"
"1211820","1212520"," right now?"
"1212600","1213080"," No."
"1213960","1216140"," There's nothing here saying begin to short."
"1216940","1221460"," So if you're looking for that failure to short, you know what you're looking for, right?"
"1221560","1226680"," You're looking for the break of the five minute trigger and we haven't broken it yet. "
"1226680","1227980"," So you can see it right here."
"1228020","1229200"," We haven't broken this five minute trigger."
"1229200","1232720"," And so that's 435.03. You want to see a break of that. "
"1232900","1237120"," 435.03. Now there's one other pitch here for sellers."
"1238660","1244500"," And that's going to be what I spoke to you about earlier, which is on Twitter I spoke to you"
"1244500","1244860"," about this."
"1245280","1247640"," It's roughly 4,300. "
"1248860","1249740"," Let's call it 4,300."
"1251520","1257440"," If we stay above that 4,300, right down here."
"1259040","1262320"," So there's one other catch or caveat here. "
"1264040","1270740"," We can fail this right now, but as long as we stay above that 430, the bulls are still alive"
"1270740","1272300"," to tag that to the upside."
"1273280","1279580"," So if you're a seller, right, you want to see that, you want to see this, get tagged here, and"
"1279580","1284520"," you really want to see a break below this 430, okay, for like full bear town."
"1284800","1287960"," Otherwise, if you see a pullback, yeah, you can do a hit and run. "
"1288480","1290640"," But expect bulls to try to take that out."
"1291540","1296240"," But don't get your like crazy town bear on unless we break below that 430, okay."
"1296740","1300940"," So if you want to get like crazy town bulls are done for all that kind of shit below this"
"1300940","1301760"," 430 currently. "
"1302780","1304520"," It's important to understand here, okay."
"1305640","1311940"," If you're a buyer or a seller or you're looking to find out what to expect next week or anything"
"1311940","1312700"," like that."
"1314100","1318500"," So we're going to, we'll talk about what to expect next week or what my expectations are, that kind"
"1318500","1319620"," of stuff here in just a moment. "
"1322920","1324160"," Now, hang tight here."
"1329000","1332840"," Let's go back to a let's go back to a Weebull chart here."
"1333780","1334820"," Let's do a spy. "
"1339030","1341030"," So let's just look in here right now, okay."
"1341310","1345470"," This is that PT2, remember the PT2 we showed you that from yesterday, right here."
"1345470","1348050"," You want to take out this stuff over here, right?"
"1348190","1349310"," That's your PT2 up there. "
"1350010","1352030"," And what don't bulls want to give up?"
"1353210","1356130"," So what would a bull be looking for into next week?"
"1356730","1358230"," It's a 30-minute chart right here."
"1358350","1360250"," Let's see if we can go back to a 5-minute chart here."
"1365990","1369010"," And what does, we'll see if we can go 15 minutes, maybe that can show it better. "
"1370950","1376510"," I want you to see this, you can see those inverse head and shoulders and that kind of stuff right"
"1376510","1376670"," here."
"1376810","1377250"," You got the low."
"1378450","1383730"," You got the squeeze up and you're looking for some kind of a hold down here. "
"1384350","1388570"," 4.23, 4.24 into next week, okay."
"1389830","1395070"," So any kind of pullback to be met with buyers stepping in right down in here, okay."
"1395590","1402550"," So for next week let's ask three down here, it's 4.23. Excuse me. "
"1403810","1413550"," And the daily trigger is the daily trigger is down at 4.26.30. So we're going to look at"
"1413550","1414990"," that real quick for next week."
"1415210","1417670"," So into a 5-minute chart here."
"1418350","1419390"," Here's your S3. "
"1420890","1422830"," You can see all these gaps down here."
"1422990","1425430"," They need to be picked up, right?"
"1426390","1428170"," Here's the daily trigger for next week, right?"
"1432380","1436360"," And we got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday right here."
"1439150","1441470"," For next week, let's make that yellow. "
"1442610","1443930"," And we'll make it large."
"1444870","1446610"," Make it nice and fat for next Friday, right?"
"1447090","1448770"," So this is what you expect into next week."
"1448950","1452050"," Here's your daily trigger, right?"
"1454130","1461350"," If you're a bull, you're going to be looking to buy this into Tuesday, okay?"
"1461710","1463390"," Turn around Tuesday, we always talk about that. "
"1464230","1466770"," You might get that capitulation move down, right?"
"1466770","1470450"," You get that quick dip down, then it comes back up, and then we're off and running, right?"
"1471470","1473150"," Then we're heading higher here."
"1473350","1474910"," So it tastes Friday, right?"
"1475110","1482150"," It tastes Friday, and you're going to look for some kind of a roll or squeeze up and roll into"
"1482150","1483450"," next week down here."
"1484430","1494290"," The most you should expect as a bull is, let's call it, 4.23.43. You have about a 15 "
"1494290","1496830","% chance. "
"1496830","1497830"," Let's call it 30%."
"1497830","1507390"," 30% chance to go and retracing all this back down like 4.23. You got about a 50 "
"1507390","1516270","% chance of coming back down here to the daily trigger at 4.30. And then another 15% chance,"
"1516350","1520070"," we just blast up here, roll down, and we're just continuing to the upside."
"1520330","1521890"," That's about a 15% chance right there. "
"1522590","1523090"," And I don't know."
"1523090","1529930"," I believe another 5% for, I don't know, a fucking moon shot to 460 or market crash down to,"
"1530050","1532690"," I don't know, a fucking below 4,000 or something like that."
"1535270","1541770"," But into next week, start to think about some kind of a put spread, right?"
"1542590","1543490"," A put spread. "
"1543690","1547310"," Doesn't it be like a max short or a max this or a max that?"
"1547910","1553690"," If you had a put spread for, let's say Wednesday or Friday, something in the money, right?"
"1553830","1561070"," I.T.M. And it squeezes up on you and your panicking and it still comes back down and takes"
"1561070","1561370"," out."
"1561430","1562890"," You get your money and you're happy to go."
"1563650","1570770"," We'll look at what this costs right now and see, we'll look at what this costs and see what it'll"
"1570770","1574290"," pay right now at 4.35, right?"
"1575750","1576950"," Let's see here. "
"1579570","1582150"," Let's see what that costs and see what it pays."
"1585100","1591360"," And we're current prices, so we're at 4.35. And all I'd be looking for here would be 4.30,"
"1591640","1598780"," 4.30 to 4.35. So remember, you just take a pay and be patient if you're a bear."
"1601360","1602700"," If you're a seller, right?"
"1603260","1606080"," And then we got what we got here, what we got here Wednesday. "
"1607740","1610740"," Monday Tuesday, up to Wednesday the 8th."
"1613680","1615840"," You can even do Friday if you wanted to."
"1617280","1619280"," And debit put spread. "
"1619280","1619960"," It'll make it simple."
"1621760","1630180"," We'll edit it at 5.35, 4.30 and 4.35. You don't make a ton."
"1630620","1637820"," For $366, you make $134.00. But, you know, it's not bad, right?"
"1637820","1638180"," It's bad, little. "
"1638960","1645880"," This basically means right here that, so if you had a Wednesday expiry, 4.35, 4.30, that would"
"1645880","1647800"," account for anything like that."
"1648980","1656760"," And the only expectation for you would be that by Wednesday, you nail this at least right here."
"1657540","1659080"," It's all you have to nail there. "
"1659260","1660140"," You nail this right here."
"1661420","1662100"," You're good."
"1662340","1663820"," If you nail this right here, you're good. "
"1664120","1665980"," If you nail this right here, you're good."
"1666620","1671980"," If you come up here and Tuesday, we blast down into Wednesday, you're good."
"1673140","1674140"," Not a bad trade. "
"1674500","1680200"," It's not like, hey, I scored a 300% rocket ship or anything like that, but it's kind of reasonable."
"1680760","1683520"," It's got a 61% probability of happening."
"1685280","1690000"," You're not expecting blood and all that, but if you get down here, and I don't know, like we get"
"1690000","1693140"," down here and you print that, then we start to reject underneath. "
"1693140","1695120"," You then get more aggressive with it, right?"
"1695760","1697180"," Start taking shorts out."
"1697220","1698600"," Start just buying fucking puts."
"1699260","1704920"," If you're expecting for that big reversal that you were looking for, you have some exposure here"
"1704920","1709540"," and you have some exposure to that downside move. "
"1709980","1710760"," It's not crazy."
"1711780","1714240"," You're not going to get blown out or anything like that."
"1714500","1718880"," Seems pretty reasonable to me to take that trade. "
"1720100","1725320"," So if you are bearish, there's your trade."
"1725960","1729900"," If you're bullish and you're like, well, cap our way up here."
"1729920","1731100"," We're so close up here. "
"1731240","1738360"," You just sit back and sit in your hands for next week until you catch that dip buy, okay, for"
"1738360","1741260"," putting any major money in the market, whether it's down here, down here."
"1742140","1746900"," You just wait down there to grab it so you can get a nice fat dip buy for next week."
"1747120","1748480"," Does that make sense to you guys out there?"
"1749460","1751280"," It's fairly simple. "
"1753440","1755560"," Fairly simple math here, right?"
"1756700","1758360"," You can see it right here too."
"1762840","1764680"," Fairly easy trade."
"1765100","1766800"," You don't really have to sweat too much. "
"1767980","1773160"," Another part of that trade too is another part of that."
"1773300","1780280"," Another good part about that trade is another good part about that trade is that if we continue to"
"1780280","1784620"," drive higher, you can trade zero dates and still be in those put spreads."
"1785220","1789940"," You can be in those put spreads and you can trade the market up, right?"
"1790140","1793640"," You can buy yourself some zero day calls and if it continues to go higher, it's going to pay you"
"1793640","1794100"," even more. "
"1795140","1800660"," So if we begin to squeeze up that 440, you've got exposure to the downside for the pullback in the"
"1800660","1801060"," next week."
"1801520","1803600"," You're making the zero day calls into the close."
"1804480","1805680"," It's a no brainer here. "
"1807160","1814040"," Definitely a no brainer for a bear or even a buyer to just put that protection onto early next"
"1814040","1814240"," week."
"1814420","1819180"," I guess you could do Friday if you wanted to if you wanted some extra time on it or something"
"1819180","1819540"," like that."
"1819640","1824020"," But Wednesday seems long enough that pullback to happen. "
"1824020","1826100"," Maybe it's in the Wednesday close or something like that."
"1826520","1834160"," If we grind up and let's say grind up into Wednesday instead of 440 and your put spread burns,"
"1834440","1834540"," right?"
"1834700","1835260"," Like, ah, fuck."
"1835400","1836640"," I'm losing this or something like that. "
"1836980","1845220"," You can always cut the one side of that trade by zero dates to trade up into Wednesday as well"
"1845220","1846400"," to cover the trade."
"1846560","1853060"," So you have like tactful ways to manage that trade even if it starts to go against you."
"1854780","1856240"," Let me see what check you guys out. "
"1857500","1858620"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"1859000","1859800"," I'm feeling better today."
"1859980","1864960"," Like right now, while I was feeling like shit this morning, right now at this moment, I feel good."
"1865200","1867140"," So I feel real good at this exact moment. "
"1867420","1869320"," So we got a bunch of stuff to go over."
"1869420","1873060"," We got to go over some we got to go over some S or some gamma stuff."
"1873760","1875820"," We have to go over some callers stuff. "
"1877980","1883740"," And I want you to realize that they're going to want you guys to be able to comprehend or"
"1883740","1886120"," understand that dips should be bought."
"1886900","1888580"," Market should be supportive."
"1888580","1896920"," And it's every time you see buyers step in, you should see the dealer's chase that buying. "
"1897760","1901540"," So expect more of a grind up than squeezing at this point."
"1902220","1903160"," Key point here, right?"
"1903380","1903840"," No more squeezing."
"1904820","1908900"," More, more expect dips to be bought and then moves to be made higher. "
"1909120","1913180"," So if you're a bull, you need to be conscious of where those dip buys are."
"1913840","1920600"," So if you see demand step in, you should see dealers follow along with that dip buying."
"1920880","1926320"," As long as we stay above that 4300, that should, that should persist. "
"1926940","1933200"," Okay, so hear all those things or hear that specific statements I just made to you."
"1933520","1941100"," You should see stability and you should see dips known dips known demand get bought and you should"
"1941100","1944540"," see dealers follow right along with that with that action."
"1945220","1946920"," So we're going to go over a few things here. "
"1947000","1947780"," Just me a couple seconds here."
"1951980","1954420"," You got a downside price target here."
"1956580","1960460"," If you can get a rejection, only if you can get a rejection. "
"1960700","1963840"," Don't say I said this stupid shit or anything like that."
"1963860","1969140"," If you get that, if you get that rejection right there, you're down side target to be 4.31.85."
"1972710","1975010"," So right in there, you're looking for the rejection."
"1975010","1976550"," See this one right here?"
"1977110","1978830"," I'm going to see that rejection right there. "
"1983110","1984830"," You have a downside target."
"1985670","1987270"," You got to see the rejection, okay?"
"1990070","1990750"," Hold up there."
"1992090","1995010"," I said I'm doing well and I'm like, oh, maybe I'm not doing so well. "
"1995890","1997570"," So expectations in the next week."
"1998210","2003090"," If you are a bull, you're paying attention to two things, right?"
"2003090","2007770"," If you're a bear, you're paying attention to two things as well, right?"
"2008330","2009590"," Failure to make a new high."
"2010010","2011810"," Ability to make a new high, right?"
"2012770","2015770"," Well, is there like something that you want to be eyes on?"
"2015850","2017570"," If you're a bear, you want to be watching that, right?"
"2018010","2018390"," You're a bull. "
"2018390","2019230"," You want to be watching that."
"2019330","2020110"," So number one, right?"
"2020670","2023310"," Failure to make a new high or ability to make a new high."
"2023950","2025670"," Number two, I said two but it's three. "
"2026250","2028810"," Number two is going to be breaking trend."
"2029630","2030590"," That's a big one, right?"
"2030590","2036330"," We break trend and that begins to stop the question of are we going to make a new high or"
"2036330","2037350"," fail to make a new high?"
"2037770","2039870"," Number two is do we break trend to the downside?"
"2040430","2043270"," That's not underneath 430, that's just breaking trend."
"2043870","2046930"," Trend for you if you're a bull is going to be the hourly trigger. "
"2047730","2050730"," Then possibly the daily trigger but mostly the hourly trigger."
"2052370","2056730"," If trend is not broken and the previous eye is made in your bull, you're going to be looking for"
"2056730","2059870"," supportive action and buying the dip at known demand levels."
"2060310","2066150"," If you're a bear, a seller, and you see that we failed to make that previous new high, you're going"
"2066150","2068250"," to be looking to sell the fuck out of that, right?"
"2068489","2072170"," Sell the fuck out of that hourly trigger, sell the fuck out of that daily trigger, get underneath"
"2072170","2077270"," it, reverse this shit to the downside and shit and rain all over a holiday rally. "
"2077570","2079449"," I think we've already had two holiday rallies by the way."
"2080150","2081810"," For this quarter we've had two in my view."
"2083130","2085710"," I've been paid very well for two rallies this quarter. "
"2086870","2088730"," This quarter has actually been very good for bulls."
"2089310","2091250"," That sounds crazy too, but it is."
"2092630","2094389"," We're likely not done for the quarter. "
"2099650","2106370"," Anyways, those are the things that you need to be watching out for this upcoming week."
"2106690","2110270"," Those are the two or three key things that you're searching for."
"2110770","2111450"," Don't be listening to them. "
"2111750","2112850"," Don't care if you're bearable."
"2113070","2117270"," Don't be listening to the sellers out there telling you why aren't we clearing out those previous"
"2117270","2122410"," fucking those previous fucking pivots, those gaps down below."
"2122550","2124290"," They know why they want to clear those things now. "
"2124570","2129470"," Like, as soon as they clear those gaps down below and we don't make that previous eye, they know"
"2129470","2131910"," that the market's going to reverse to the ugly downside."
"2132730","2138990"," They also know like long time market participants also know that if you do get the new high and"
"2138990","2143910"," pull back to close out those pivots down below, they know they're going to get bought and they"
"2143910","2145230"," don't want to see those things get bought."
"2145830","2147370"," They want to see those things fail, right?"
"2147570","2151650"," They want to see us go down and close those gaps and they want you to think that you're going"
"2151650","2158090"," to buy that dip and you're not going to notice that we didn't get that previous high and so they're"
"2158090","2159890"," going to fucking set your ass, right?"
"2160030","2162670"," Trap you and send it even lower and lower and lower. "
"2162830","2164210"," It's going to be a fucking nasty blood bath."
"2165470","2167430"," Remember what I just said to you as a bear, right?"
"2167590","2174350"," I said don't be short in this until you see the rejection off that one minute trigger right here,"
"2174470","2174590"," right?"
"2175270","2180510"," You want to watch this action right here and see what this action shows you because I'll tell you"
"2180510","2182830"," what this thing regains right here, right?"
"2183010","2189010"," Because you have supportive flows we go back up right here, you're going to get squeezed again what"
"2189010","2193650"," you're looking for rejection right here and you're seeing the pain trade right now for bears."
"2193970","2199110"," I'm going to show you this right here This is in pain trade right now and you're going to start"
"2199110","2203830"," seeing bears get squeezed out and they're going to be like oh no, no upset blah blah blah blah and"
"2203830","2209390"," what you'll see happen right here in this pain trade is you're going to see the squeeze up. "
"2210530","2212770"," The bulls want to see a new high right here, right?"
"2213610","2222290"," If you're a bear by the way you might be given an opportunity to get out somewhere in here when"
"2222290","2227250"," you get squeezed out up here you might be given the chance at least to at least get out at"
"2227250","2230590"," some point Here goes your pain right there brothers and sisters."
"2233410","2234830"," There goes the pain."
"2236710","2239090"," Remember some of you are all out there probably already fucking short, right?"
"2239550","2245890"," I can just max short right now You want to see the rejection here, you need to see the rejection"
"2246850","2261040"," You want to see the roll and then jump on that 3,"
"2261140","2264820"," 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 15s Yeah, you can do it now, you can do it at the end"
"2264820","2265180"," of the day. "
"2265560","2268300"," If you put spreads you don't really care about this price action."
"2269200","2272700"," If you're in put spreads you just close your fucking laptop and don't come back and look at it"
"2272700","2278000"," until Wednesday You can trade some zero day calls and shit like that like today into Monday or"
"2278000","2282120"," something like that if you wanted to offset it but you don't do anything you just fucking place"
"2282120","2286120"," your fucking bed and walk away I guess you could get max money if you wanted to wait until we"
"2286120","2294820"," hit that red bar up here If you want to like, feel like one of those fucking two tech collars"

"2312610","2321170"," there to say I don't really have too much more other than that If you want to know for me"
