"45560","46240"," How are you?"
"49700","52020"," Good morning, Jeremy Joshua."
"52020","57440"," I can't see half of you right now."
"58080","60760"," You know, my glass is here. "
"62660","63739"," Good morning, HP."
"63980","64600"," Good morning, RS."

"91900","92520"," we trust."
"96090","97550"," Good morning, Bob, good dude."
"98550","99370"," Joshua, Mikey, the fish. "
"100910","103170"," Your wife's boyfriend, let me know who, shit slammer."

"118730","120110"," I'm bleeding out of every hole I have."
"123450","124330"," Good morning."
"124550","125350"," I have to order a bell. "
"125670","127750"," I'm going to order a bell that's on my list."
"130210","131630"," Love, good morning, John."
"132250","132790"," Hey, Zahn. "
"133530","134130"," What up?"
"134370","134810"," Not a suit."
"135970","136370"," Ed Ward."
"137170","137970"," Good morning, everybody. "
"138290","138830"," Hope everybody's here."
"139290","140030"," Good morning."
"140770","141550"," Good to see everybody. "
"142090","143550"," We have a lot to talk about, I guess, don't we?"
"144290","145690"," I mean, wowzer."
"146450","147470"," What do you have to say?"
"147930","148550"," Does that even work?"
"148730","149030"," Wowzer?"
"150210","152570"," Not sure if that works this morning."
"155470","159530"," I hope that none of you have blown your accounts at this point. "
"160430","161070"," Let's start there."
"161170","162490"," Well, first, let's start with Ukraine, right?"
"163450","168110"," So I guess we have to separate the two."
"168470","172770"," So we'll start with, you know, we hope the loss of life is low. "
"173510","175190"," Of course, everybody hopes for that."
"175470","179650"," And, you know, I give my support to Ukraine all day long."
"180550","181210"," And a story. "
"181810","190970"," Now, we have to keep our main street hat this morning and our Wall Street hats separate."
"191990","200770"," Yesterday in Livestream, I talked to you about the setup that was taking place in the market"
"200770","202710"," leading into the close yesterday."
"202710","211750"," And we talked about how in cash market, we couldn't drop the market to where the banks wanted it. "
"213730","223030"," So for that to happen, they will intentionally drop the market in cash market into like four o "
"223030","223490","'clock hour."
"224230","225530"," Typically, it happens on a Friday."
"225950","228610"," It doesn't happen on a Wednesday into a Thursday Friday. "
"228610","235190"," But of course, we've got bad economic economic data presumably coming out today and tomorrow."
"236190","238830"," We have the start of the Ukraine war."
"239430","246970"," And so you can use these news items as an excuse, believe it or not, just an excuse to put"
"246970","247990"," the market where you want it. "
"248830","254190"," And you have to be aware of that that that's the case."
"254430","256690"," It has nothing to do with the actual war in Ukraine."
"256690","263690"," It has to do with the mechanics, the underlying mechanics that the engine of the stock market has"
"263690","266390"," to do with profit taking, believe it or not. "
"266570","271530"," I know that some of you don't want to believe that, but there's a bid put into the market that"
"271530","272810"," retail does not control."
"273470","277130"," And there's a time to take profit for large banks."
"277570","285190"," So you have to keep that in mind on how the news, how events are used out there for taking"
"285190","286070"," those profits, right?"
"288010","291770"," And we've had some specific examples of this in recent history. "
"292070","295270"," We're going to look at that in just a moment in that very recent recent history."
"295590","300510"," Actually, I think twice now, once in December, I believe in once in January, we're going to take a"
"300510","301370"," look at those this morning."
"302710","308170"," So I can show you how these things set up, how these events take place, how they make them happen,"
"308310","311030"," and then what to look for just after they happen. "
"311030","313130"," Okay, because they do follow a protocol."
"313630","314730"," That's how they happen."
"315170","322670"," And we talked about this in the closed yesterday because we also said, Hey, we've got quote unquote"
"322670","326230"," rate increases coming in March, right during FMC. "
"326890","333970"," And those will bring volatility and they need to get the price to a certain place over this weekend"
"333970","339010"," to set up for rate increases in March."
"340550","342970"," This is the perfect opportunity for this to happen."
"343530","352640"," Now, on that same token, so as we were looking for the market to sell off in January, right before"
"352640","359960"," to find that top in January, I'm switching to trying to find the turn down where we are right"
"359960","370880"," now. "
"370880","371680"," Going up, going up."
"372680","381320"," There is a small class of investor, small class of trader that is actually making the transition to"
"381320","384200"," selling the market back in in January."
"384620","384660"," Okay. "
"385280","389520"," And so just for myself, when you hear me say to you things like, well, I'm going to buy each"
"389520","394840"," close the last two days, it was in it is in anticipation of this taking place."
"394840","402080"," Now, the one issue that I was having was in the day or in the cash market, we weren't getting"
"402080","404800"," that steep sell off in the overnight."
"406140","413160"," And we were just seeing declines 1%, 2%, which is not enough for a capitulation move for that swing"
"413160","414840"," around for that turnaround in the market. "
"414840","421760"," Now, we were able to get it last night, which makes me excited personally because you need to have"
"421760","426120"," that capitulation move in the market for a turn in it to take place."
"426580","428080"," Now, they're able to do it last night."
"428380","428840"," It's great. "
"429260","435120"," I was expecting it in the last couple days yesterday, today, possibly into Monday could have been"
"435120","436760"," tonight could be Friday into Monday."
"437740","438960"," That will see that turn."
"439300","446660"," So I want you to be aware, as we trade in the next few days today, tomorrow into Monday that"
"446660","448820"," volatility could be very high. "
"449000","453940"," There could be lots of moves that can wreck both a bull and a bear, believe it or not."
"454580","456180"," So there can be there."
"456300","458600"," There's a possibility of high volatility. "
"459820","463280"," And then at some point, there should be a turn that's made in the market."
"463640","468200"," Now, we'll talk down the road, what can take place into March, what can take place into summertime."
"469740","472420"," But there's some key things that I want to talk to you about this morning. "
"472860","476180"," Now, the first thing I want to show you this morning is I want to give you that as a"
"476180","476940"," general idea."
"478020","483440"," So you'll hear people out there say we're going on 400, going out of 360, we're going down to 340,"
"484280","486360"," 300, 290, whatever you want to hear."
"486640","487320"," It doesn't really matter. "
"487800","491820"," As an investor and as a trader, what matters is that you kind of see where the market is, you"
"491820","494820"," kind of know beforehand what to expect at some point."
"495220","500260"," As long as those things that start to play out, you can kind of get a feel for where we"
"500260","502900"," are, where we're going and where the real money is."
"502900","507480"," And so most of the money off this downturn is almost done. "
"507860","513240"," There should be a nice rip coming up 300, 400 points, and you don't want to miss that rip and"
"513240","517260"," you don't want to get caught up in the mindset of we're going to continue to go down from here."
"517679","522360"," Because this is a point where bulls who at the top in January, this is where bulls lost money,"
"522360","522559"," right?"
"522960","528700"," They kept buying the dip, kept buying the dip and you'll see bears down here where we are begin to"
"528700","529640"," keep selling."
"529640","533280"," And they'll give back most of the gains that they made on the way back down. "
"533420","538360"," So there's maybe a wear on a macro side where there should be a turn and it is right around"
"538360","539240"," here, right where we're at."
"539560","540580"," And so we're going to talk about this more."
"540700","541340"," I'm going to look at some charts. "
"541880","543140"," I'm going to show you how these things play out."
"543220","546720"," I'm going to show you two examples in the past and recent memory, how these have played out"
"546720","550260"," specifically to how what happened last night in the stock market."
"550900","555400"," We're going to briefly look at the definition of a stock market crash as I saw a lot of posts"
"555400","558720"," this morning saying stock market crash, stock market crash, right?"
"559140","560660"," So I don't do want you to see this. "
"561220","564640"," So there's no numeric specific definition of a stock market crash."
"565620","569100"," But the term commonly applies to the clients of over 10%."
"569100","570560"," And this is the key, okay?"
"571120","574020"," And I'm in an index over a period of several days. "
"575120","576440"," Not a month, not two months."
"577080","578340"," It's just several days."
"578760","582260"," Okay, so to speak, conscience of that, it's basically 10%. "
"582260","582840"," Okay."
"582840","587240"," And they're also distinguished from there."
"588260","590740"," Crashes are often distinguished from bear markets, right?"
"591300","595180"," Periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years. "
"596020","598420"," Just be careful of your designation."
"598620","599360"," Are we going to crash?"
"600280","601040"," Are we in a bear market?"
"601760","602800"," And there's a distinction there."
"603440","606660"," The bear market is different than a crash. "
"607000","608900"," Crashes typically happen when we're in a high."
"609560","614280"," You see this big move up high and then we crash down 10% or more, believe it or not."
"615440","620420"," So, and then we're going to look at the percentage drop that we had last night and see if this"
"620420","623580"," qualifies as a crash, right?"
"623860","624780"," Don't take a look at that right now. "
"625080","626680"," And we're going to go to yes real quick, right?"
"628040","630140"," And so it's just the high in the last few days, right?"
"630260","631820"," This right here is the 16th."
"633080","635400"," We're at roughly 8%, okay?"
"635900","638480"," So 16th has given you at least 10 trading days."
"638940","641460"," We haven't seen a stock market crash here. "
"641820","643360"," This is not a stock market crash."
"643640","645540"," This is not defined even loosely."
"646800","649980"," As a stock market crash, we'll see somebody say, hey, we're in a stock market crash. "
"650780","651240"," It's not a crash."
"651520","652320"," This is a bear market."
"652860","655900"," It's defined as a bear market, even in loose terms. "
"656560","660040"," This is described more as a bear market, not as a stock market crash."
"660400","664760"," It's important for you to have that understanding as we move forward in this market as a trader and"
"664760","665300"," as an investor."
"666100","670280"," Because if you hear crash, it's not the definition of one, okay?"
"671240","675260"," Because they mean different things and they have impacts on the market over time. "
"677040","678520"," Okay, so we're at 8% right now."
"679120","681340"," So we're going to go back when we look at something else and we're going to come back to this"
"681340","681580"," chart."
"681880","685340"," And I'm going to show you a few things real quick before we get to that of the chart. "
"685860","688560"," I want to show you some examples, some previous examples here."
"692090","692950"," I'm going to come back over here."
"693010","694310"," I want to show you a couple of things here, okay?"
"695390","698030"," Two events, two important events. "
"698430","700150"," Let me see if I can get this first one back here."
"702990","704210"," I want to show you here."
"704290","707590"," This is December 16th, okay?"
"708590","711070"," It's about 7 a.m. in the morning, right?"
"711170","713130"," And we declined through the day, okay?"
"713850","717270"," And this is 4 p.m. in the afternoon right here on the 16th, okay?"
"718290","722230"," So we end up waking up the next morning, right?"
"722370","725030"," This is like four, five, six o'clock in the morning. "
"726730","731090"," We sold down here to the 10, 30 hour, tried to regain our composure."
"732070","733630"," And we continued to sell down."
"733810","735730"," This is the 1600 hour right here. "
"735830","738330"," This is 4 p.m. We ended up giving it all back."
"738630","739730"," It was a major move down."
"740050","742470"," We saw waterfall cascading puts into the close. "
"743930","745430"," And then we came back into the market."
"745570","748850"," We wound up going down another huge percentage, okay?"
"749470","751010"," And so this isn't the 20th right here, okay?"
"751110","752230"," I want you to see this difference here."
"752230","758110"," This all took place over the course between the 16th to the 20th here, okay?"
"758190","759170"," I'm waiting to see that, okay?"
"759290","764270"," So that difference here, this huge move down that we had, this huge capitulation move, and further,"
"764770","767630"," the huge moves that took place in the after hours. "
"768350","770350"," We had another one that took place later on."
"770730","774770"," Most of you probably remember this, not even new traders would kind of remember these moves that we"
"774770","774950"," had."
"775730","776470"," Another move here, right?"
"776630","779490"," This is 11 o'clock in the morning on January 20th. "
"779490","782310"," And I posted this on Twitter yesterday before we started selling off."
"783290","787630"," I think when we talked about this, even yesterday, the streaming go back and see that we talked"
"787630","791170"," about, we've had this happen in previous days where there's a setup."
"791290","792550"," You can't get the market to go down. "
"792650","795710"," This is the first time we tested 420 down here."
"796270","798010"," And they couldn't get it done in cashmark."
"798130","803010"," You couldn't get small mid-sized banks retail to cut themselves loose. "
"804310","809210"," And so a large bank will come in in low liquidity environments and they'll dump it for you without"
"809210","810890"," you knowing it's going to happen, okay?"
"812250","814890"," And so we had this happen here on the 20th."
"815070","816970"," This is 4 o'clock in the afternoon, okay?"
"817590","821050"," On the 20th, we're going to go into the morning of the 21st, right?"
"821510","824570"," We trade down here on the 21st, right?"
"824790","828990"," Then we come back on Monday, and there's a giant sell move down."
"829350","834630"," And they bought a ton of puts into that bell so that dealers had to sell futures, okay?"
"834630","836510"," And so we woke up with a huge move down. "
"836630","842170"," I want to show you this real quick for just a percentage, or a thought of percentage here, okay?"
"844070","846490"," So I just want to show you this move down here, right?"
"846650","847410"," This move is just giant."
"847630","856320"," We haven't even started way back here, but this brief period here, or just a few days right here, 8 "
"856320","859360",".27%. This is a huge move down."
"860520","862480"," And I also want to show you something else, okay?"
"863000","866440"," In this move here, I want to show you one more thing, okay?"
"869280","871940"," And this is that same move right here, okay?"
"874260","876840"," Another 8% swing up right here, okay?"
"876880","881000"," I want you to see this 8% swing high as well. "
"881440","882480"," So this is where you can get wrecked."
"882760","885780"," And inside this area, you see this zone right here?"
"889900","892120"," This is the volatility that I'm talking to you about, okay?"
"893540","897120"," I want you to see also one more further thing, time-wise."
"897120","899620"," This is at 12.30 in the afternoon. "
"899840","901860"," We didn't see a bounce until 12.30 in the afternoon."
"902200","904680"," Back on that other date, we had that same issue."
"905420","909620"," We continued to trade down that next day into the middle of the afternoon. "
"910480","912400"," So you got more bears trying to jump on."
"912740","914700"," You've got FOMO bears jumping in."
"915320","921920"," They need these FOMO bears here to buy all these puts that people are already holding. "
"923080","927660"," So I want you to be careful of this this morning that you could get real bearish on the open."
"928660","930180"," You load up with the rest of the bears."
"930600","931960"," You missed the trade yesterday. "
"932620","936120"," And you want to trade this down and then you get caught around midday, okay?"
"936300","937960"," Sometime around midday, you end up getting caught."
"938700","939820"," And we trade back higher."
"940300","944240"," You never actually print those puts that you got yourself into today, right?"
"944380","947600"," If we do this again, this is the other example is the exact same, okay?"
"948960","954480"," You end up seeing mass volatility over the course of days and then a much larger move higher. "
"955480","959000"," So that means that you should be looking for a bottom, okay?"
"959060","962820"," No matter what they say for today and tomorrow, you're looking for a bottom."
"963480","967980"," And you're probably looking for a month out spread higher, believe it or not, okay?"
"968400","970520"," It doesn't matter if this takes even until the 18th."
"970780","975340"," You're going to be looking for some kind of a bottom and a long position here. "
"975340","979000"," Now, the safest bet here is to buy stock that you like."
"980180","984740"," Maybe sell puts again sit much lower for the short amount of time heading forward."
"985640","991560"," This could take from March into April or May, but you'll see a nice fat move higher from here,"
"991660","991800"," okay?"
"992200","996260"," We're at that place where you should be finding yourself really, really good stocks to buy into"
"996260","997360"," this morning. "
"997600","998660"," Stuff that you can trust, right?"
"998840","999380"," Stuff like Google."
"1000200","1001280"," I don't know about Apple."
"1001800","1006860"," Maybe I still think Apple's going to go down a lot more, but there's some stocks out there that are"
"1006860","1007820"," safe bets, right?"
"1007940","1010720"," That you can buy that shouldn't have sold off as deep as they have. "
"1011100","1016880"," And you're more than likely going to get some sort of a real than a rally after today."
"1017060","1018360"," I don't know if it's today or tomorrow."
"1018840","1020480"," It could be today or tomorrow at some point. "
"1021340","1023680"," But in reality, you're going to see some massive rallies in here."
"1024000","1028960"," Now, while you're doing this over here, getting yourself a nice fat position in the market, right?"
"1029079","1036720"," A safe position either in the money calls that are dated three months out or spreads that are dated"
"1036720","1037599"," a month out, right?"
"1037740","1038700"," In the money, something like that."
"1038859","1041780"," You can even do some outside the money stuff, take some risk on up higher. "
"1041880","1045420"," This is like a three or four hundred percent or three to four hundred point move, okay?"
"1046380","1048280"," And you're going to be looking for that same kind of a move here."
"1048380","1051560"," And then we're going to get real aggressive with some zero date options."
"1051560","1053000"," We're going to look for a bottom here. "
"1053320","1055720"," And every time we trade down here, we're going to grab zero dates."
"1055720","1057600"," We'll do the same thing on the top while we consolidate."
"1059160","1063440"," We'll sell this and we'll buy this as we move forward and then eventually make this move higher,"
"1063640","1063820"," okay?"
"1064460","1065600"," Expect this to happen. "
"1066080","1073260"," You're going to give this about an 80% chance to 90% chance that this move specifically like this"
"1073260","1074400"," will take place."
"1075020","1082600"," There is only a very small chance, very small, that we would continue a sell down from here, okay?"
"1083520","1087220"," If you're a really super duper marriage, you're like, yeah, we're going to sell it even further"
"1087220","1092120"," down, cap, not just till 12 o'clock this afternoon or, you know, I'm closed today or something like"
"1092120","1092340"," that."
"1093060","1094340"," And you want to get short?"
"1094560","1096100"," Sure, just don't follow me. "
"1096820","1102140"," But I can tell you from previous experience, every single time we sell down like this, for years"
"1102140","1106600"," and years, like decades, we end up having this big, huge move up higher from here, okay?"
"1107460","1109780"," So be careful what you listen to on CNBC right now."
"1109780","1113500"," Be careful what you listen to from bears out there right now."
"1114060","1115680"," There's a lot of money made in here. "
"1115960","1121320"," In this zone here is some of the best money making you can actually make in this market, okay?"
"1121440","1122480"," There'll be severe moves up."
"1122560","1124960"," You can make thousands of percent."
"1125400","1129040"," You can make 10,000 percent from this move to this move right here, okay?"
"1129400","1132000"," Because no one's going to want calls down in here. "
"1132680","1134020"," And there's going to be no interest."
"1134620","1138900"," They're going to cost pennies to buy pennies, pennies, 30 cents, 20 cents."
"1138900","1143960"," If you get them farther out, what takes place is you have to structure them. "
"1144140","1148400"," You structure them like weeklies, monthlies, three months out because some of them won't start to"
"1148400","1150160"," print until time passes."
"1150760","1154240"," Let's say you buy like a five cent call down here and it's like a three month out call."
"1154700","1158720"," It'll take a month for it to turn into like 50 cents, like three cents. "
"1159240","1164020"," It'll turn to like 50 cents a dollar, some stupid like that way over here for like a three month"
"1164020","1164240"," call."
"1164240","1169420"," So you have to structure and lay out what your risk is going to be."
"1169880","1171220"," Now, even in all this, right?"
"1172080","1176160"," I wouldn't say you go full bore, but if you're a cash rich, if you've got cash on the sidelines,"
"1176500","1181780"," something like that, going somewhere, you know, somewhere into like a 30 percent position, 10 to 30"
"1181780","1184600"," percent position in here is going to be a fat payout. "
"1185220","1185760"," One way or another."
"1186520","1187520"," Have you disagree with this?"
"1188100","1190800"," You can get the fuck out of my stream because I'll tell you right now."
"1190800","1196280"," This is where I make most of my gains come in moves like this. "
"1197360","1197800"," Okay."
"1198140","1199980"," This is for years and years and years and years and years."
"1200300","1202320"," All the real investors out there know this. "
"1202760","1204980"," This is old school, old timey out there."
"1205360","1207820"," We even see this morning, Jenny Marcus is out there."
"1207940","1208780"," He's an old school bear, right?"
"1209100","1210400"," This is fucking bearish as you can get. "
"1210920","1212980"," And even that guy knows that you buy this bottom."
"1213840","1215800"," That doesn't matter if it swings down lower slightly."
"1216060","1219180"," It doesn't matter if we get out another fucking 50 points, 75 points. "
"1219400","1219940"," It means shit."
"1219940","1224520"," If you buy stock down here in the next month, three months, these are going to print fat and heavy,"
"1224520","1224840"," okay?"
"1225360","1228960"," Now, we're probably going to have three of these events this year."
"1229300","1231220"," We're probably going to have one now. "
"1231440","1233160"," We'll have something in March or May."
"1233760","1234720"," And then we're going to probably have something."
"1234940","1237600"," We might have a small one in June or July, but then we're going to have a big one probably"
"1237600","1238280"," in the fall. "
"1239060","1239120"," Okay."
"1239200","1240300"," Real nasty one at some point."
"1241600","1243280"," I know I can't care if the nasty one comes later. "
"1243440","1244260"," I don't care if it comes in March."
"1244460","1245380"," I don't care if it comes in May."
"1245780","1247260"," But this market that we're trading right now. "
"1248180","1250220"," Let's say this market goes sideways for the year."
"1250560","1254040"," It's only up 9% for the year or down 9% for the year."
"1254480","1258760"," If you're an investor, you have to be able to adapt to what this market is going to be this"
"1258760","1264640"," year and know that there are going to be two to three kick-ass opportunities in this market to buy"
"1264640","1265780"," a dip, okay?"
"1266660","1268220"," And people say you can't time bottoms. "
"1268340","1271540"," People tell you that you can't time the big swings in the market."
"1271760","1276640"," And this market like this, you can generally pick two or three spots this year."
"1277280","1281600"," You can confidently buy a stock and you might get a swing down lower slightly for a little while. "
"1281900","1285260"," You can confidently buy it and know that it's going to come up at some point this year and make"
"1285260","1286480"," some decent profit off it."
"1286560","1288720"," So if you're a bull out there, we're getting close."
"1289240","1290220"," We're almost there. "
"1290420","1291840"," It's like it could be half a day today."
"1292300","1295980"," It could be in the Friday or even possibly Monday."
"1296800","1301600"," But in this time frame right now in this zone where we are, we're getting into that place where"
"1301600","1304940"," you're even going to see bears know that they're going to start buying down here, okay?"
"1304940","1306740"," You're going to see accumulation down here. "
"1306880","1308280"," You've seen some rotation down here."
"1308620","1312180"," And now we're going to get some full liquidation at some point, but it ain't today, okay?"
"1312700","1316260"," Don't be listening to bears tell you that we're going down 30% today."
"1316460","1317560"," The market's going to crash today. "
"1317900","1319180"," You're going to get that kind of fucking nonsense."
"1319420","1321440"," It's just not happening today, okay?"
"1321600","1323600"," So all that noise you're hearing out there."
"1324000","1326280"," I know some of you out there think that's what's going to happen, but it's not. "
"1326940","1328880"," We've got other reasons why it shouldn't as well."
"1329220","1332180"," We've got some options stuff out there we'll talk about."
"1334970","1336490"," We're going to look at that right now, okay?"
"1336490","1337590"," We're going to look at something else. "
"1337670","1339790"," We're going to go right back over here to today's move."
"1341950","1345370"," And we're going to talk about where we are and where we should be going."
"1347370","1351850"," See if I can make a little bit bigger here for you before we get into SpongeBob and say in"
"1351850","1352210"," this morning. "
"1354410","1355770"," We're going to look at today, okay?"
"1356430","1357750"," Or a door, you know, just this move."
"1357750","1360450"," Oh, wait a minute here."
"1360690","1361810"," I'm going to throw out the trash. "
"1365420","1366180"," Let's look at the one here."
"1366320","1366560"," Fuck it."
"1370780","1373000"," Okay, we're going to come right back over here, right?"
"1382000","1383580"," Now this vicinity over here. "
"1389020","1389740"," Excuse me."
"1390420","1392500"," My expectation though is that we have a fair chance."
"1393280","1397580"," We can trade down here like 4023 today. "
"1398180","1402100"," We could possibly even trade down to this 390, 395 in the coming days."
"1402560","1405200"," We could end up bouncing around in here the next couple days."
"1405980","1406520"," Could be into Monday. "
"1407140","1409780"," Could even meet a March, March, middle of March, doesn't matter."
"1410500","1411340"," But at some point, right?"
"1411920","1416180"," The volatility is going to come off the market and we're going to make this move higher, okay?"
"1416780","1418740"," We have a Vanner Alley today at some point."
"1418840","1422620"," We could snap down here to 400 and then have a 3D Vanner Alley move up. "
"1423020","1424060"," Huge money in here."
"1425000","1430980"," If you want to be a stock buyer, you might be a stock buyer into end of March and a"
"1430980","1432260"," May, something like that, okay?"
"1432780","1433740"," There's going to be some bears out there."
"1433820","1437360"," They're going to tell you we're going to do some fucking goofy like this and start trading down and"
"1437360","1440440"," breaking down to this next level down here, okay?"
"1441680","1442820"," They ain't happening right now. "
"1442820","1444700"," I promise you that ain't happening."
"1444700","1448360"," It's too much greed in banks to not buy this bottom."
"1448900","1452740"," There's not, there are no options out there that are telling you we're going to be making this move"
"1452740","1453040"," down. "
"1453320","1456100"," And we can always keep our eyes on this next move down here."
"1456220","1462000"," If we start to see options being purchased for down below here, some kind of risk off move, we can"
"1462000","1465760"," pay attention to this and cut our losses above here or break even up here."
"1466200","1467780"," But this is not in play right now. "
"1468120","1469340"," Let's be conscious of that, okay?"
"1469340","1474600"," What is in play right now is some sort of a bottom today and tomorrow."
"1475540","1477800"," Big, huge move, violent moves, okay?"
"1478220","1479560"," It's going to wreck bears at this point."
"1479700","1484520"," Any kind of formal bears, it's going to wreck some bulls that are not planning out their week and"
"1484520","1485980"," their month and their month and a half ahead. "
"1486540","1488200"," So you start real conservative, right?"
"1488300","1493440"," You start buying yourself some stock, start selling some deep puts to crazy bears that want to get"
"1493440","1493900"," down here."
"1494480","1496740"," And then you start taking some spreads in the money down here."
"1496740","1499380"," Look for a nice fat bounce down below here. "
"1499820","1503260"," And then we're going to start trading crazy zero dates, right?"
"1503480","1506440"," One date, zero dates and we're going to make these rips go up and down, up and down."
"1506880","1512040"," And you're going to come back and take your profit after we're done with FOMC in March, okay?"
"1512520","1517400"," So start to keep this in your game plan today as we move forward."
"1517720","1521640"," We're going to see a shift in momentum coming up here and through here, okay?"
"1522040","1526640"," Even if you start to see puts coming out today, that's going to be put selling that's taking place. "
"1527140","1532520"," And then we're back holding the fat bags of puts, they're going to be handed off to FOMO bears down"
"1532520","1532900"," here, okay?"
"1533020","1534640"," So be conscious of this as we move forward."
"1535200","1537020"," Now we're going to talk about stock gamers report this morning."
"1538380","1541440"," Features are down sharply after geopolitical events escalated. "
"1542360","1546780"," The gamma is extremely negative across all indices ETFs and the VIX is near 37."
"1547480","1552860"," This implies that the market is pricing in a 2.3% daily S&P move."
"1553400","1555040"," Huge move in the market today. "
"1555720","1556200"," Huge."
"1556920","1558780"," You should see a 2% move today."
"1559280","1560980"," That doesn't count up and down either. "
"1561100","1566580"," You could see a move down today, off the bell to 400, and then a 2% plus move above"
"1566580","1567740"," after that today."
"1568500","1569660"," We have to be conscious of that."
"1570260","1572140"," Overhead resistance shows lately at 4200. "
"1573240","1575300"," So mark that on your charts, right?"
"1575440","1577740"," And then more substantially at 4300."
"1578660","1582040"," Support is at 4064 and 4000, okay?"
"1582040","1585580"," Somewhere in this zone, you're looking to be buying a dip, okay?"
"1585980","1586720"," Somewhere in here."
"1588020","1592760"," We've been highlighting for several weeks 4050 area as a major support area. "
"1592880","1594900"," The market is now poised within a striking distance."
"1595460","1598080"," Much of our data suggests that we're near a lower bound."
"1598320","1599680"," That's similar to what we saw in January. "
"1600980","1601680"," Okay, remember that."
"1601880","1606620"," In January, the snapshot below from our equity hub shows the rate of change of gamma of the large"
"1606620","1611460"," node of 4050 suggests gamma changes significantly into that strike, which could invoke a hedging"
"1611460","1612800"," response and support."
"1613520","1617260"," This change of gammas do a large open interest at the 4000 strike, okay?"
"1617640","1622420"," So basically they're saying is that puts print and people are going to take profit off of these"
"1622420","1626180"," puts, these hedges that they have in the market and they're going to need someone to sell them to. "
"1626760","1631040"," Near current market levels, we also see gamma pro-off profiles flattening out substantially."
"1631820","1634480"," To read this as a signal that gamma is maxed out at current levels."
"1634480","1639300"," In other words, put options have gone deep in the money towards one delta, which reduces the"
"1639300","1640180"," downside gamma force. "
"1640800","1643140"," We also believe dealers a long tail risk, right?"
"1643700","1645680"," I posted this on Twitter many times, right?"
"1646140","1651860"," You take tail risk on how many times in January they say to you guys, buy yourself tail risk event"
"1651860","1653540"," insurance, put back spreads."
"1654140","1655000"," We've talked about it, right?"
"1655300","1655900"," Put back spreads."
"1656520","1657320"," They are fucking free. "
"1657680","1662980"," We've talked about this, which is likely paying off now that implied volatility has surged higher."
"1662980","1664580"," IE, VIX, and Air 40."
"1664760","1669220"," This further reduces how heavily dealers need to chase the downside, right?"
"1670120","1676160"," So if you listened and bought put back spreads, you are now in the money for an outside risk event,"
"1676380","1676580"," right?"
"1677000","1680360"," You're going to take profit from that risk event, right?"
"1680520","1681740"," You put the money inside your pocket. "
"1682320","1685240"," You don't care about the stock that you've been holding, you refuse to sell."
"1685800","1689180"," When the captain told you to sell and he said fuck, I'm just going to cover with this tail risk"
"1689180","1689860"," dirt cheap."
"1690700","1693020"," Mind you, like 30 cent plays, right?"
"1693440","1693960"," They're free. "
"1694680","1696440"," So they're going to take profit from this."
"1696600","1699760"," This further reduce how heavily dealers need to chase the downside."
"1700680","1706140"," There's been a feedback loop on the way down, and dealers will start to on hedge themselves from"
"1706140","1706740"," this market. "
"1706980","1711000"," That means that dealers will start to buy the market."
"1711300","1714200"," And when the dealers start buying the market, that's when you see the Venerily."
"1714480","1719320"," So when you see the big buyers come in, you start to see an overwhelming absorption of sellers. "
"1720080","1726140"," You wind up seeing shorts panicking to cover, and you start to see that that's melt up."
"1726500","1731200"," When that happens, and you are one of these traders that sits there and goes, I'm going to wait for"
"1731200","1733800"," the next next moment to jump in."
"1734120","1734960"," You're going to miss it. "
"1735120","1739320"," You guys, I know that some of you guys out there, you miss these trades higher because you say,"
"1739460","1740280"," nope, nobody going up."
"1740420","1742520"," Nope, this is going to keep burning and you're going to miss that trade."
"1742700","1747740"," So be be don't don't go all in 100% but be able to be like, hey, I'm going to"
"1747740","1749160"," start averaging into this trade. "
"1750240","1755800"," I'm going to put 1% in, 5% in, 8% in, get a nice fat position at the"
"1755800","1759060"," right price for that move up as it starts to melt up."
"1759220","1760940"," Every time it starts to melt up."
"1763760","1764640"," So chase it down. "
"1764760","1768580"," Sorry, we're talking about that right in sync with this max out idea is our delta tilt reading,"
"1768720","1770700"," which is now below the January 22 levels."
"1771160","1779160"," And just above December 18th and March of 20 key in on this."
"1779160","1784200"," This depicts put delta called out and essentially tells us that positions relative to calls just"
"1784200","1785900"," about as heavy as we've ever recorded. "
"1786600","1789520"," In summary, we'd be looking for recovery markets."
"1790200","1793940"," There should be a test of the 4050 area key in on this."
"1794600","1795860"," Okay, there should be a test. "
"1797380","1801980"," This is the bounce that would be based off the options positioning of the market as outlined above"
"1801980","1804140"," and we think last for a few sessions."
"1804880","1808440"," Okay, we currently see hardly any resistance back up to 4,300."
"1809020","1810560"," Ultimately, that's 300 points. "
"1811140","1815500"," Ultimately, any rally would be unstable until there's a major reduction in put positions."
"1816300","1819400"," We do not see that happening until March 16th."
"1819600","1823540"," Okay, or to the 18th, the FOMC in large OPEX expiry. "
"1825260","1827220"," IE, you're going to get bounces here."
"1827500","1830140"," We're going to trade sideways here into the 18th."
"1830140","1836000"," And unless you start to see more hedging, more puts being bought down to like, let's say 340, 360. "
"1837460","1839940"," You're eventually going to see this huge banner rally take place."
"1841860","1843720"," I'm going to scroll through this so you can all see this, okay?"
"1846250","1847070"," So what are you looking for?"
"1847270","1848810"," If you're going to be like, hey, I'm going to be buying some Tesla."
"1849330","1850530"," I'm buying some Google. "
"1851210","1851770"," I'm buying some Apple."
"1852510","1857770"," You're looking for a test of 4050 to buy some of that stock, right?"
"1857930","1859610"," You're looking for that test down low on 400."
"1860410","1865930"," You don't have to wait for like 4050 for whatever your own risk appetite is. "
"1865990","1867290"," You don't have to catch the exact bottom."
"1867830","1873870"," You'll be looking down at 400 for a retest at some point between now and the 18th that you can"
"1873870","1875170"," take long, okay?"
"1875690","1879610"," And you're going to also be looking for short covering rallies along the way."
"1880370","1882510"," Just keep this in mind as we trade forward. "
"1885570","1887050"," Let me see what you guys are saying up there."
"1887130","1889410"," Okay, so we've got 12 minutes left."
"1889410","1890750"," Okay, 13 minutes left. "
"1890910","1892090"," We're going to get rid of this screener here."
"1892810","1895450"," And I'm going to bring up this one here for you."
"1895990","1896970"," It's kind of neat, right?"
"1897090","1901410"," You're looking down at this ES 15 day, 15 minute chart doesn't tell you much. "
"1901770","1905090"," It looks like we've slipped under down below this node over here."
"1905550","1909890"," And the reason why you don't want to be looking at this chart is because of how far back we"
"1909890","1914150"," have to go to look to see where we actually are over time, right?"
"1914290","1916750"," We have to look farther, farther away."
"1917530","1920810"," So we're going to look at 360 days, believe it or not. "
"1921510","1922990"," We're going to apply this, okay?"
"1929590","1930650"," Pretty nasty, huh?"
"1931310","1932170"," That's a whole year."
"1932790","1933410"," Pretty nasty."
"1934490","1937710"," You've got a node right here, 407. "
"1938390","1942330"," Here I'm talking about 405, 406, right?"
"1943250","1944450"," Somewhere in here we've got a node."
"1945070","1948690"," Our next node down below is 393, 3965."
"1950010","1952750"," Okay, so we could get a push down here today. "
"1953410","1958910"," We get a push down here once, maybe even between now and March 18th."
"1959030","1961330"," You might want to trade sideways in here, right?"
"1961690","1964350"," We could trade higher and then reject and come back down."
"1964730","1967270"," And then on the 18th, maybe we slipped back down to this 390. "
"1967910","1969450"," We're on our way higher, okay?"
"1969810","1973730"," It's be conscious of this ES chart over the course of one year."
"1974950","1976030"," Okay, so you can get a viewpoint."
"1976510","1979370"," The next thing I'll do is we'll look at..."
"1979370","1980550"," We're going to look at..."
"1980550","1983950"," I'm going to look at a year chart right now for most of your favorite tickers. "
"1984210","1986230"," Okay, we're not going to look at the 15-day, 15-minute."
"1986530","1987910"," We're going to look at a year chart right now."
"1988010","1992570"," So you can see where we stand with whatever ticker you want to be looking at the next week. "
"1993390","1996070"," So we'll call out, gently call out to me some tickers."
"1996830","1997410"," Don't flood me."
"1997850","1999170"," We've got 20 minutes left. "
"1999390","2004470"," I'm going to give you guys 10 minutes of looking up your favorite tickers on a year chart."
"2004470","2006290"," So you can see if they're near bottom or not."
"2008050","2009450"," No, no straddles. "
"2009850","2010930"," I am long here."
"2011210","2012730"," I am long all day long here."
"2013450","2015830"," I am full on bull at this point. "
"2016570","2018270"," I'm looking to just buy bottoms."
"2018630","2020210"," Every single one of them will let them rip higher."
"2020850","2022550"," And I'm looking to take this market long down here. "
"2022890","2023690"," 100% percent."
"2025290","2025730"," 200%."
"2029760","2031380"," Yeah, don't fuck around with energy. "
"2031720","2034020"," Yesterday, what did I say to you guys about USO yesterday?"
"2034020","2038400"," Only stock yesterday has said USO up 7% in the overnight."
"2039860","2041740"," Up 7% in the overnight."
"2043180","2044320"," Okay, slow down here. "
"2044440","2044940"," We've got Tesla."
"2045380","2047560"," We'll start with Tesla, then AMD, then ASO."
"2048100","2048540"," Hold on. "
"2055750","2056030"," Beautiful."
"2056810","2057550"," Beautiful chart."
"2058350","2059290"," Look at Tesla over a year. "
"2060810","2061590"," Gorgeous chart chart."
"2062389","2063210"," How deep can it go?"
"2064469","2065210"," Look at this."
"2065550","2067409"," It says it's at 763, right?"
"2069070","2070050"," Where are we today?"
"2071350","2072770"," Where are we at right now, 700?"
"2075270","2078570"," Here's 691, possibly a dip down to 691. "
"2079210","2080590"," Beautiful support down here."
"2081929","2083969"," Absolutely gorgeous support down here."
"2085030","2085750"," Absolutely gorgeous. "
"2086409","2088790"," If you're a bull, you want to know when to buy Tesla?"
"2089330","2090949"," I don't know what else to say to you at this point."
"2091510","2092949"," I don't know what the fuck to say to you."
"2093290","2096350"," I don't know how much risk you can put out on this market, but right now where we are in"
"2096350","2097650"," Tesla is beautiful. "
"2098450","2099170"," Absolutely stunning."
"2100050","2101430"," Can we grind down below this?"
"2101550","2101770"," Sure."
"2102130","2105310"," How much of a bottom do you want on Tesla?"
"2105910","2108190"," I don't know what else to say to you at this point, right?"
"2108450","2109790"," I don't know what to say to you at this point. "
"2109970","2112530"," If you want to buy Tesla, this is a good entry."
"2113250","2114750"," This is a good short-term entry."
"2115410","2124610"," If you trade sideways off this, if we start to grind, maybe we grind down to 700 right now, right?"
"2124610","2127530"," But we're at 700 right now in pre-market, I think. "
"2128370","2129450"," What do we grind down to?"
"2129710","2130790"," Do we start grinding through this?"
"2131430","2132070"," I'll lay down to 400."
"2132530","2133910"," I doubt that's today."
"2134890","2138470"," If we sit down here and we don't have a move higher, sure. "
"2138650","2139130"," Just get out."
"2139290","2140130"," You didn't lose too much."
"2140170","2142970"," Have a nice stop loss down around 650 or so. "
"2143510","2145370"," But right down here at 700, I'm going to bet that we're."
"2145690","2146870"," I'm going to bet that you're fairly good."
"2146930","2148850"," This is a pretty good, pretty good berg down here. "
"2149590","2153490"," You'll have plenty of time to know if we start selling down Tesla currently from where we're at."
"2154670","2155430"," So I like Tesla."
"2155790","2157130"," I like Tesla a lot, by the way. "
"2157630","2157890"," All right."
"2157910","2158350"," Let's start with you."
"2158470","2158910"," Do Tesla. "
"2159530","2160050"," We'll do AMD."
"2163950","2165370"," Let's do AMD next."
"2168920","2171980"," Let me look up AMD and see what their pre-market price is here. "
"2174600","2175980"," I'm going to follow along with you guys."
"2176220","2176620"," Hold on here."
"2178900","2180740"," I'm going to kill this one here. "
"2181660","2182700"," I think type one second."
"2186560","2186960"," What?"
"2187460","2188440"," AMD is down what?"
"2188820","2189440"," Five fucking dollars?"
"2190180","2191340"," You guys are killing me."
"2191440","2192680"," The second one down is $5. "
"2193040","2196520"," We're at $1.5. AMD, I don't know if I like this one right here."
"2196820","2199020"," Could trade down as low as 95."
"2200140","2201080"," Before I'd buy it. "
"2201780","2202000"," Okay."
"2202220","2203960"," Down here at 109."
"2204520","2206660"," It was down 105 at one point. "
"2207440","2208860"," So it's slightly lower."
"2209900","2211180"," So I don't know about AMD."
"2212480","2214600"," Maybe AMD could trade somewhere in here. "
"2214680","2216460"," Some consolidation down to $95."
"2217000","2218160"," Good one to call out though."
"2220620","2221060"," ASO. "
"2224330","2228470"," So compare that AMD chart to the Tesla chart, right?"
"2228930","2229930"," Not that it doesn't come back."
"2230130","2231770"," Not that AMD doesn't trade higher off the bell today."
"2232250","2233610"," It doesn't get picked up right off the bell. "
"2233950","2237690"," My point to you is that if you look at the AMD chart versus the Tesla chart."
"2238270","2239210"," I like the Tesla chart better."
"2240030","2240470"," Okay. "
"2240710","2242150"," So we're down here on ASO."
"2248200","2250360"," $62 or $62 right now."
"2250440","2251140"," It's down pre-market. "
"2252360","2253020"," 54 cents, right?"
"2253660","2254800"," Sitting right on a node right here."
"2255100","2256140"," I'm bearish on ASO."
"2256660","2257460"," I'm bearish. "
"2257500","2260420"," I'm bearish down to $25 in ASO believe it or not."
"2261160","2262640"," I don't like where it's sitting right here."
"2262960","2268400"," If you're bullish on ASO, you've got sellers just screaming at $34 to get rid of it. "
"2271860","2272260"," Apple."
"2281280","2282680"," Again, I don't like Apple either."
"2282840","2283580"," We talked about this yesterday. "
"2283860","2285980"," I told you that Apple has a lot of room to run lower."
"2286760","2287980"," So I like Apple at 150."
"2289900","2290300"," 150. "
"2290780","2292080"," I don't like Apple where it's at currently."
"2292500","2296700"," Even if Apple trades higher, I still see sellers above trying to get it down to this."
"2296700","2297800"," No down below here. "
"2297980","2299000"," I'm going to call it a 150."
"2299640","2301640"," It's already been down to 153 at one point."
"2301840","2303700"," What's that right now in the after hours?"
"2303700","2304420"," Is it already down here?"
"2305340","2306800"," Is it already down to 150 maybe?"
"2308260","2309560"," That's only down four bucks. "
"2310520","2311360"," Down six bucks."
"2312260","2313040"," I want to see it."
"2313280","2315060"," I want to see it bounce today at 150. "
"2315780","2317700"," I think I'm going to get a catch up out to 150."
"2318280","2319040"," Then I like it."
"2319460","2325700"," If the March 18th, I like it better at 135, believe it or not. "
"2326480","2328880"," Oh, shit."
"2329040","2331880"," You guys are throwing out shit stonks that you're fucked up in."
"2332520","2334040"," Don't be sending me shit stonks. "
"2334240","2335860"," Send me text in the chat."
"2336540","2337280"," Give me stonks."
"2339020","2339500"," Yeah. "
"2339580","2340140"," I don't like it at all."
"2340880","2341360"," Sellers."
"2342360","2343360"," Sellers at $21. "
"2345460","2348980"," Don't send me stocks that you've been back holding for two years."
"2352890","2354410"," Apple, CCJ, Google."
"2354630","2355330"," I'll do Google next. "
"2360640","2362540"," Don't be showing me your bags."
"2363240","2364020"," I don't want to see your bags."
"2365140","2374980"," I've got some support down here on Google at $24.55. Next note of support, $23.10. Some major"
"2374980","2387010"," support at $21.15. And then, you know, ugly is down at $17.85. No"
"2387010","2387430"," Roblox. "
"2387590","2388410"," I'm not doing Roblox."
"2391230","2391810"," Apple."
"2392110","2392610"," I already did Apple. "
"2393590","2394710"," You guys are hilarious."
"2395350","2396330"," Show me your bags."
"2396770","2398510"," I'll do Amazon next for you. "
"2400970","2402050"," Don't show me your bags."
"2402190","2404090"," I don't want to see your companies that are back holding."
"2405550","2406430"," I don't. "
"2410040","2410480"," Amazon."
"2411900","2413500"," Let's see if I can get this Amazon."
"2416270","2417910"," This is a one year chart on Amazon. "
"2418230","2418550"," Look at that."
"2418790","2419230"," Nastiness."
"2420110","2421310"," Just pure nastiness. "
"2422070","2423590"," We're looking for a bounce on Amazon."
"2423590","2425090"," We talked about $2,800."
"2425090","2426170"," I think we're down to $2,800. "
"2426310","2428570"," Yeah, we're down to $2,800 right now, right?"
"2429050","2432610"," In pre-market, we'll look at a longer chart on Amazon."
"2435360","2436660"," Bigger time access than $3."
"2436840","2437920"," I don't know if it can go bigger than a year. "
"2438460","2443340"," Maybe two years ago on Amazon."
"2447380","2449700"," I don't think we've ever looked out on a two-year chart on Amazon."
"2450680","2451560"," Amazon, you're ready?"
"2452640","2453340"," Real support on Amazon?"
"2454080","2454700"," $2,500. "
"2455880","2457040"," We're already down to $2,800."
"2457600","2460400"," So we're sitting on this cliff right here with Amazon."
"2460400","2461980"," You see where we're sitting right now?"
"2462520","2473540"," 2,800 real support on Amazon 2477 Yikes Nvidia"
"2481260","2490980"," See where Nvidia is currently in pre-market down Down 8%"
"2490980","2496200"," down 16 bucks down to what's it down to right now?"
"2499360","2510420"," Well, it's down to $188 in pre-market Wait, I get the wrong wrong ticker here Like"
"2510420","2518920"," $188 doesn't sound right So down pre mark down 4% not too bad Coming into it's two hundred and"
"2518920","2519580"," ten dollars. "
"2520140","2528920"," I Like it Don't like it a lot, but I like it at 210 That was its average."
"2529140","2529660"," I'll give it a note."
"2529860","2531300"," I'll give it like a B for a chart. "
"2531980","2537100"," I really like it down here at a hundred and forty five dollars That's really where I like it be"
"2537100","2539120"," honest with you 144 dollars."
"2539320","2543540"," That's where I really like it But it could be stable stable in here."
"2543660","2544640"," This is a two-year chart too. "
"2544720","2559990"," I could I'll switch back to the one-year chart To the one-year Yeah,"
"2561370","2571710"," you know It's down to one Or 210 right now Somewhere in here I"
"2571710","2572430"," like it here."
"2572670","2573010"," I like it."
"2573150","2577190"," I like it generally I'd like to see it come down at some point this year 240. "
"2577770","2581010"," I don't think it's right now But I think eventually it comes down."
"2581230","2582730"," I think eventually at some point this year."
"2582870","2596910"," You'll definitely see 140 on on Nvidia Let's see My"
"2596910","2600130"," dad my dad called me this morning as we should cash out his blue friends today. "

"10812450","10818130"," staging You what you do is you go on to the offense your attack russia Uh, you bog them down"

"17731680","17738300"," drop is intended to soften the news Uh, I think if he was to say that publicly without it being"

"17754880","17755180"," time."
"17755340","17760220"," My assumption is That uh, he has to come out strong here."
"17760340","17769270"," He doesn't have a choice I don't think he has a choice here I think he has to get aggressive"
"17769270","17774790"," with russia Uh, I think he's going to get aggressive with russia We talked about this as past few"
"17774790","17775450"," speeches, right?"
"17776070","17782250"," That uh, his speeches were to me docile And complicated Corporation said the account of parties"
"17782250","17790080"," taking 1.65 trillion dollars Say a previous speeches. "
"17790420","17794780"," He's been complicated in his statements He's basically outlined what he basically outlined what"
"17794780","17799860"," russia could do And then we saw russia do What I wanted to do, right?"
"17800520","17806740"," It took those two provinces And now it's overstepped those bounds and begun to invade the the rest"

"17839530","17840410"," gonna get aggressive here."

"17854410","17860390"," that I wish he had gotten that hawkish before russia had invaded Uh because you can see how how"
"17860390","17865130"," most world world leaders tend to be simple in their statements You've seen you crane even their"

"25598060","25598460"," Yes. "
"25599100","25599840"," Hold on here."
"25599840","25601620"," Okay, so I'm back on spy again."
"25602560","25603440"," Every 25th. "
"25603860","25605800"," Every one of these pumps I jump on them."
"25606380","25608740"," Let it consolidate or dip and then I jump back in again."
"25609940","25612140"," Okay, so let me see. "
"25613640","25614720"," The 428th, right?"
"25615960","25616920"," It's a nice target."
"25617980","25625670"," I've seen some sellers coming in briefly here, but then green balls of death over here."
"25626810","25628130"," I hope I don't miss this one. "
"25631590","25632130"," You look closely."
"25633490","25634150"," Oh, yeah."
"25635690","25636910"," Folds are down here at 425. "
"25638730","25640390"," No fucking bears in sight."
"25647490","25647930"," Hold on."
"25648050","25649230"," You guys are killing me. "
"25649890","25651350"," You're going to get back in on spy again."
"25651710","25652750"," Yeah, I take profit every time."
"25652810","25654610"," Every time we make a rip higher, I take a profit. "
"25655290","25656310"," Then I look for my next entry."
"25657110","25657870"," Hell yeah."
"25658410","25659090"," Holy shit. "
"25659670","25659970"," Tesla."
"25661050","25662010"," January 20th."
"25662550","25663030"," 1050C. "
"25663550","25664330"," $3.8 million."
"25666330","25666810"," Tesla."
"25667250","25667530"," Golden ticket. "
"25670630","25671030"," 121622."
"25671590","25671990"," 1050C."
"25672370","25673490"," $3.6 million. "
"25674830","25676350"," Tesla's getting pumped roomed over here."
"25679000","25679520"," All right."
"25679640","25680760"," So I'm looking at 428th again. "
"25682860","25683660"," All right."
"25683680","25683900"," Sorry."
"25684020","25684540"," Hold on you guys. "
"25685140","25686520"," You guys are killing me over here."
"25687540","25688200"," All right."
"25688420","25689080"," There's one more time. "
"25689200","25689300"," Okay."
"25689440","25689800"," From the start."
"25690660","25691880"," Sorry to ask you guys again. "
"25692580","25692880"," Hold on."
"25692960","25693780"," We got angry mama."
"25694200","25695160"," I've got GRWG. "
"25700690","25701490"," Mad scientist."
"25701650","25702850"," If you're in here, pull one up."
"25703990","25704430"," Avery. "
"25705210","25706210"," Oh, no."
"25706350","25708350"," These are where I don't read more requests from Jill."
"25708550","25708970"," Vishal. "
"25709270","25709550"," Up tight."
"25709750","25710270"," Mad scientist."
"25718890","25721590"," I'm looking for ticker callouts from those people. "
"25729270","25731370"," Give me a ticker call out from Jill."
"25732070","25732510"," Vishal."
"25732910","25734150"," V-I-S-H-A-O. "
"25734590","25735030"," Up tight."
"25735310","25735910"," And mad scientist."
"25740860","25741480"," All right. "
"25741660","25742860"," And then I'm sitting on."
"25743140","25743920"," I'm not having bottom here."
"25743920","25745100"," I'm at 48 C's. "
"25746080","25747080"," God damn it."
"25747160","25747360"," Robert."
"25749400","25750740"," Robert, through your name in there. "
"25752770","25753530"," Robert Love."
"25754210","25754650"," What does it call you?"
"25754910","25756290"," Love Andy."
"25760090","25760930"," Robert Love Andy. "
"25761170","25761970"," Universal Health Services."
"25762830","25763010"," Switch."
"25763870","25763930"," VMware. "
"25764350","25764890"," And C-Scaler."
"25765190","25765710"," Among many others."
"25769030","25769290"," All right. "
"25769490","25770770"," So I'm sitting on some Tesla."
"25771250","25771810"," I'll receive a spy."
"25772170","25772710"," 428th again. "
"25773830","25775530"," I'm sitting on 428th."
"25775630","25776690"," So now up to 254."
"25777730","25778230"," 258th. "
"25782310","25782670"," 261."
"25785800","25787880"," We've got a 15 minutes into the bell."
"25788040","25790500"," We're either going to get a pump into the bell or going to sell off into the bell. "
"25790500","25791160"," One of the other right."
"25793660","25794740"," From in some calls again."
"25796820","25797180"," 428th. "
"25800000","25800760"," See where they go."
"25803340","25803900"," White burn."
"25805140","25805680"," Doesn't matter. "
"25805860","25806360"," I'll add to them."
"25810380","25811360"," You have 15 minutes."
"25811520","25812400"," 14 minutes to the bell. "
"25812940","25815000"," Sometimes we sell off here at the end, last 15 minutes."
"25815180","25816720"," So we've been driving hard all day long."
"25817520","25818760"," So we could see some selling here. "
"25818840","25819680"," I'm not going to lie about that."
"25821240","25822900"," So if you see some selling into the bell."
"25823320","25825280"," We'll watch the bell at the close. "
"25825680","25831380"," The other thing you want to consider is that the interest in calls will wear off at the bell, even"
"25831380","25832120"," if we go up tomorrow."
"25832680","25835640"," So you could get a good buy in between like four o'clock for 15."
"25836720","25839000"," Better buy in on this trade here. "
"25840260","25841260"," So we'll see where it goes."
"25841540","25842460"," See if it makes money or not."
"25843720","25845440"," See if there's a bump higher into the bell. "
"25845440","25850980"," If you are buying calls down here for a bell trade for the last 15 minutes or so, if you"
"25850980","25856720"," are, you might want to take profit right at the bell because you'll see interest in calls, inputs."
"25857340","25858480"," There's a couple of things you need to know."
"25859460","25861920"," So like first of all, I've been trading high all day long. "
"25862560","25866500"," Last 15 minutes, you might see some profit taking here on the market."
"25867160","25868540"," So you've got that to contend with."
"25868840","25874480"," If you see the profit taking into the end of the market, you'd have to wait to buy calls until"
"25874480","25875080"," after the bell. "
"25875480","25881620"," If you see we trade higher into the bell, you might want to sell those calls right at 3.59,"
"25882000","25885820"," and then you would re-enter after the bell if you think we're going to gap up tomorrow."
"25886600","25888920"," Then you have the bear contention, right?"
"25889040","25893340"," If you look at a bigger chart on the, look at a bigger chart on the spy here."
"25894540","25897960"," There's even a little bit of selling in BKKT currently as well. "
"25897960","25900280"," Just be aware of the selling in BKKT."
"25900740","25901940"," You might squeeze up."
"25904400","25905680"," That doesn't mean it doesn't trade higher. "
"25905960","25907640"," I'll show you that trade later."
"25911650","25918030"," If you're going to look at like a month here on the spy, you could see either a gap up"
"25918030","25920770"," tomorrow to 4.32. That's possible."
"25921970","25923270"," Gap up to 4."
"25923430","25925310"," We're already close to that 4.28 area. "
"25926130","25931430"," But you could see a return to the scene of the crime to 4.32. It's possible to return to"
"25931430","25932010"," the scene of the crime."
"25933830","25936870"," Or you could see us trade sideways and down into tomorrow."
"25937530","25941090"," And then I move up to 4.32 tomorrow for Friday. "
"25942270","25946930"," And that would kind of leave you left hanging into Monday, not knowing which direction we're going"
"25946930","25949110"," for Monday, Tuesday."
"25950270","25956710"," So you could, you know, take a trade in the bell here today, whether before or after risks of money"
"25956710","25958650"," on the hopes of a gap up."
"25958650","25960190"," Not your entire account or anything. "
"25960450","25966350"," If it doesn't work and you lose your money, you'd be looking to reenter some kind of a cashback"
"25966350","25967110"," trade, right?"
"25967810","25972050"," On Friday for closing the Friday tomorrow, right?"
"25972610","25973770"," There could be two trades here."
"25974110","25978470"," Two long bullish trades put a little bit of risk on the table into a gap up tomorrow so you"
"25978470","25979210"," don't get left behind."
"25980750","25985690"," And then have some money available to take a cashback trade tomorrow off the bell. "
"25985690","25990910"," If we were to trade backwards down to, let's say, 420, and then we trade higher into Friday's bell."
"25991590","25994170"," So you got two bullish trades on the spy."
"25996070","25997410"," And so we'll see where that goes in tomorrow. "
"25997610","26001550"," I'm in a long trade right now on the spy into tomorrow, currently."
"26002250","26005950"," Now, even if we sell down on the bell, I'm going to put some money on the line into a"
"26005950","26007890"," gap up situation tomorrow."
"26009690","26014430"," And so I think this trade works probably for the next two days into Friday. "
"26015530","26018750"," This is two to three different ways from the print to you."
"26019230","26020910"," Let's say you take 10% of your account."
"26020990","26023310"," You do a 5% of it today, 5% of it tomorrow. "
"26023930","26027090"," They should still print like 100% each on a bullish context."
"26027510","26029350"," So just where you are in the market right now."
"26030330","26031990"," Risk the money in a gap up tomorrow. "
"26032470","26037730"," And if that fails, risk the money on the open tomorrow on a cashback trade, right?"
"26037890","26043090"," We trade back to a previous close and that you trade it."
"26043090","26045010"," You pick up that trade again tomorrow."
"26045590","26047890"," So there's two ways you can see if you don't worry all night long. "
"26048570","26053570"," If you don't get left behind, you put some money on the table right now into a gap up tomorrow."
"26058240","26059280"," There's two trades here."
"26059900","26061300"," There's like a trade for overnight. "
"26062320","26063340"," That's gapping up."
"26063780","26064520"," Short covering."
"26065040","26066680"," And there's a trade for tomorrow. "
"26067100","26075420"," Now trading at $4.27.36. Got a price target of $4.28. We called it again lower, right?"
"26075420","26078600"," We went from level to level to level to level to level."
"26079000","26081420"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"26081720","26083320"," Call's printing again, baby. "
"26084020","26085600"," Give me some of that free money."
"26086280","26087840"," Give me that free money."
"26089720","26091540"," Give me that free gap up money. "
"26093720","26096660"," Give me that trade sideways and gap it up money."
"26097620","26099360"," Give me some money here."
"26100420","26100940"," Beautiful. "
"26101180","26102680"," Call's coming into the money right now."
"26103220","26111040"," Now trading at $2.91. Coming into the money on $4.28. Send them."
"26117910","26118590"," Give me that. "
"26118670","26118970"," Give me that."
"26119170","26119950"," Pump into the clothes."
"26121090","26123270"," You know, pump it up into the clothes. "
"26130340","26132460"," Throw a bone to these bears, I know."
"26133200","26134000"," And they're poor families."
"26134780","26135880"," They're finally able to buy houses. "
"26137220","26141200"," All these bears, I was watching a video of all these bandic house buyers."
"26142600","26146060"," I realized that the bears weren't able to buy houses the last few years."
"26146060","26147820"," So all this money they've been making. "
"26149080","26152480"," They're the ones that are the extra home buyers right now."
"26152620","26153580"," Like, I want to get in right now."
"26154000","26155200"," I finally made all my money. "
"26155300","26156740"," It's taken me fucking two and a half years."
"26161940","26162780"," Pamp it, baby."
"26163620","26164160"," Pamp it. "
"26164420","26165180"," Pamp it into the battle."
"26165320","26173410"," Give me $4.29. I'll take $4.28. Pamp it, baby."
"26175390","26177390"," All right, so we're going to try this one more time, okay?"
"26179950","26182670"," $4.28.03. Price target achieved. "
"26185570","26186590"," Can we get to $4.30?"
"26187990","26189390"," Can we get to $4.29?"
"26191010","26192290"," Can we get to $4.29?"
"26192690","26193290"," Can we get up here?"
"26194030","26194910"," Can we get up here?"
"26195090","26195950"," These sellers up here."
"26196090","26196990"," Reach out and touch somebody."
"26197770","26198670"," Sellers are above it. "
"26198810","26199870"," $4.29 currently."
"26200310","26203130"," At the end of the bell, we've got eight minutes left in the bulls."
"26203690","26205470"," Just slap a high five on the market. "
"26206130","26211810"," Send it to $4.29. Give me another dollar to $4.29. Get up there, Spy."
"26212670","26216410"," Run it up to $4.29. Where are the sellers now?"
"26217290","26218310"," Where are the sellers now?"
"26218470","26221930"," $4.28.93. Pamp it."
"26222210","26222550"," Give it to me. "
"26222650","26224770"," Give me that fucking reach up to the sky close."
"26225590","26226970"," Give me that like sky hook."
"26227170","26228570"," Just slap the back of the backboard. "
"26229310","26230450"," Big giant green balls."
"26231410","26233250"," Can we climb the wall of Warrie?"
"26233450","26235430"," To return to the scene of the fucking crime."
"26236390","26238230"," Give me my money back. "
"26239530","26242010"," Give me my money back now."
"26242770","26243690"," Go higher."
"26244190","26244410"," Higher. "
"26245270","26247050"," Get up to $4.29. Trade it higher."
"26248250","26249230"," Get up there."
"26249750","26250650"," You dirty dog. "
"26256970","26258530"," Get up there."
"26260310","26261170"," Snag it."
"26262070","26263490"," Get up there. "
"26264410","26270130"," $4.28.72. $4.28.74. $4.28.70. Get up there and just touch it."
"26270130","26270210"," Touch it."
"26271510","26272150"," All right. "
"26272230","26272570"," Good enough."
"26272730","26273170"," I'll take it."
"26274350","26275730"," For six minutes left. "
"26276690","26277870"," Six minutes left."
"26278350","26280890"," It'd be bar to see that climb right into the bell, right?"
"26281290","26283810"," We just reach up to the sky with giant green bars."
"26284210","26284970"," Slap 430. "
"26294470","26296010"," Guys are killing me."
"26297630","26298610"," Pamp it, baby."
"26299910","26300610"," Pamp it. "
"26301350","26308130"," If you're in here right now, Jill, Vishal, Optite, Mad Scientist in Robert L."
"26309270","26311870"," Drop me a ticker to chart for you guys tonight after the bell."
"26317610","26318710"," That's two times, right?"
"26319010","26319850"," Two times on trades."
"26320930","26329390"," $4.28.80. So close to $4.29. If you guys are out there listening right now, Jill. "
"26329590","26331970"," I can't really pronounce the last name."
"26332210","26335630"," Jill, Vishal, Optite, Mad Scientist, Robert L."
"26344260","26345600"," Post some tickers in the chat, please."
"26347830","26348910"," You guys, I called out. "
"26353920","26355100"," Give it to me, baby."
"26355340","26355800"," Pamp it."
"26356760","26357880"," Slap that ask. "
"26359020","26360260"," Slap it right into the close."
"26361960","26363760"," Give it, said that a long time, right?"
"26364180","26366980"," TMO for, I got TMO for Mad Scientist."
"26368160","26370300"," I'll be posting these on that captain's alpha tonight. "
"26371340","26372200"," Thank you, Abraham."
"26375630","26376810"," BBY for Jill."
"26378730","26379210"," Okay. "
"26380930","26384110"," I'm missing Vishal, Optite, and Robert L."
"26384370","26385530"," If they're not in here anymore."
"26386650","26388090"," Angry mama, great day, right?"
"26393340","26403320"," Spy Crank in $4.28.76. Tesla, $8.01.21. $8.00"
"26403320","26406720"," into the close in the bell, $8.02 on Tesla."
"26408200","26409400"," Pamp it into the bell. "
"26411220","26412480"," Pamp it into the bell."
"26413820","26418080"," Put that trade on into the bell, then put another trade in on after the bell in the spy if"
"26418080","26418360"," you can."
"26420980","26428640"," $800 from a low in the cash market, in a low in $6.91 to $8.02 on Tesla. "
"26430080","26431960"," Buy Tesla, trade of the day."
"26432760","26433500"," Buy Tesla."
"26434420","26434800"," Buy Tesla. "
"26441510","26441930"," Buy Tesla."
"26442730","26443870"," Yeah, hold on, you guys."
"26451140","26452220"," Futes are tapped. "
"26454600","26455860"," You guys have a great day today?"
"26456500","26458880"," I'll follow up with Vishal on uptight and Robert L."
"26459400","26459820"," Oh, Robert."
"26467150","26469010"," Now we're probably going to sell off here into the bell."
"26470910","26471850"," Close your calls. "
"26472630","26476190"," Wait until after the bell, if you want to buy some more after the bell."
"26476350","26477410"," We've got a sell side imbalance."
"26479230","26485530"," You still have dealers probably buying futures, probably not at the rate. "
"26489170","26489930"," No, really?"
"26494130","26494590"," Tesla."
"26496470","26497710"," Zero dates on Tesla."
"26498250","26499010"," Fucking Frankie. "
"26499610","26500190"," He's sick bastard."
"26502250","26503890"," Do we trade up into tomorrow?"
"26504470","26507450"," So we should have, let me look at Spy real quick."
"26512080","26517220"," Let's look at Spy as we come into the bell and see if we want to take a trade into"
"26517220","26517580"," the bell. "
"26518400","26520820"," So you can buy Spy after the bell, of course."
"26523480","26525520"," Let's look at calls and puts."
"26526880","26531660"," Still have for tomorrow 272,000 puts out there. "
"26532220","26534740"," They've been strangled down to like 12 cents."
"26536380","26539120"," We would have liked to have seen more bears in the market right now."
"26544760","26550020"," Still bears on February 28 buying 416Ps. "
"26553980","26557760"," Let me take a look here."
"26563730","26565250"," Wait for the bell to close here."
"26566750","26569290"," Take your profits on test on the last minute, okay?"
"26570950","26572850"," Take your money and fucking run. "
"26573010","26577510"," We might gap up tomorrow, but my thought process is that will be flat in futures."
"26578870","26583270"," Maybe slightly higher in futures, but not enough to pay you until the bell."
"26586890","26588850"," I knew that beautiful clothes right here. "
"26589070","26590690"," Look at that green bar in and up into the bell."
"26591510","26592830"," They're going to green bar this up."
"26596740","26598540"," I'm going to push this right into the bell, guaranteed. "
"26599360","26600980"," Just a fat short covering into the bell."
"26601620","26605460"," Probably make fucking 20% on this close on Spy."
"26605960","26606860"," I think a one minute trade. "
"26611510","26618510"," Spine up $6 in the day, 1.52%. We're pretty close here."
"26618950","26625290"," I would close for profit here and look for a trade to pick up tomorrow on the Spy."
"26625450","26630130"," I could be wrong on this, but we could gap up. "
"26630290","26631330"," It's the same trade, right?"
"26631610","26632150"," Range left of the bell."
"26632350","26633170"," Put a second trade on."
"26633730","26635590"," Put a small amount of money in a gap up tomorrow. "
"26636290","26637990"," 20 seconds is the closest I'll in New York."
"26638390","26639330"," Who do I think happens?"
"26639950","26641090"," Probably trade down tomorrow."
"26641430","26642790"," Pick it up again for another ride higher. "
"26644210","26646110"," But yeah, I would say you just take 10%."
"26646110","26647910"," I'll buy some calls here with you."
"26649570","26651530"," I don't mind buying some calls here after the bell. "
"26655860","26660540"," Let me see, 4.30. 4.32 would be the implication."
"26661100","26667470"," So I'm going to buy some 4.32s. And their trade, they're starting to lose a little bit of interest"
"26667470","26668250"," in them right now."
"26669050","26670470"," They're at $1.32 right now. "
"26671570","26679950"," Now $1.34. We're already up 25 cents after the bell."
"26682330","26685050"," In 2014, $2.67 billion in revenue."
"26685370","26689330"," That's a $2.72 billion consensus expectation for Intuit. "
"26694200","26699640"," Some of them look for a trade higher to $4.32. My assumption would be $4.30 is probably a"
"26699640","26701140"," better trade if we trade down tomorrow."
"26701420","26704220"," It's that $2 you'd have to dollar cost average into it."
"26704340","26706780"," And then consider, hey, will we close tomorrow at $4.32?"
"26707820","26711000"," I don't know the answer to that currently right now. "
"26711000","26713760"," Let's see if I can get some cheap calls for tomorrow."
"26715140","26725100"," And we're going to wait between now and $4.15. Hell yeah, you guys"
"26725100","26726100"," bought this pre-market."
"26726480","26727220"," Fuck yeah, Loaf. "
"26728360","26729520"," You guys make money today?"
"26738990","26739870"," You guys are crazy."
"26740270","26740970"," Wait, don't buy Tesla."
"26741330","26742250"," You wait bike for Tesla. "
"26742930","26743410"," You guys are hilarious."
"26745850","26747010"," You guys are hilarious."
"26749850","26754710"," So I'm watching 4.32s right now. "
"26754850","26757850"," They're down to $1.16. They were $1.34 earlier."
"26758270","26763510"," So wait for some of this to cool off into the $4.14, $4.15 hour."
"26763990","26766170"," So you can get some nice cheap $4.32s for like a buck. "
"26767630","26768130"," Maybe."
"26781010","26783950"," Got some wild numbers here on the spy."
"26784210","26786610"," We'll still let it cool off into the $4.15 hour. "
"26787150","26791170"," So you can get some cheap calls on the risk of a gap up again tomorrow."
"26791170","26796410"," We are at resistance just so you know if you're a bull right now."
"26796770","26800230"," On the downward channel, we've traded straight back to resistance. "
"26800790","26810740"," Point-based COIN reporting at revenue of $2.49 billion from half a billion a"
"26810740","26811280"," year ago."
"26811620","26813880"," And there's beat expectations for COIN."
"26814260","26819440"," EPS $3.32 beats a 195 consensus for Coinbase, Charlie Oscar, indeed, November. "
"26821100","26824540"," I'm going to show you a chart before we close here on that captain's alpha."
"26825660","26829500"," And I just want you to see what the bears are thinking right now."
"26830380","26830860"," Nope. "
"26833080","26833800"," I'm in here."
"26834140","26834480"," Hold on."
"26835240","26837460"," So the bears are thinking they're going to short it in tomorrow. "
"26839300","26841060"," And that's the plan for bears."
"26842020","26851850"," So if you look here, I got my day trading shit in here."
"26852410","26854230"," The whole conversation this evening. "
"26864680","26866880"," So you can just see what the bears are thinking."
"26867540","26869580"," And I'll post this to captain's alpha."
"26869920","26871780"," This is what the bears are looking for. "
"26882890","26884630"," The bears are looking for tomorrow."
"26884910","26887550"," They're looking for a rejection and a retest down below."
"26889190","26897050"," The bulls are looking for is a gap up and a consolidation and a decision on a move there or"
"26897050","26897430"," here. "
"26902840","26906780"," And what I think is going to happen is we're going to trade down and then up."
"26909610","26910170"," Kind of goofy."
"26910570","26911150"," This is really shitty. "
"26916240","26918360"," But we are in a critical junction in this close."
"26918700","26919300"," So I'll leave this on."
"26919700","26920860"," Captain's alpha right now. "
"26921400","26924600"," So you can see the decisions that you have to make between on this close."
"26929720","26930560"," It's a horrible."
"26930840","26932820"," This might have been one of my worst drawings yet. "
"26935580","26938520"," But I don't even know if you can understand these this drawing."
"26940840","26942040"," And we got a few more."
"26943660","26944880"," Joshua Conklin you're in. "
"26945220","26949100"," So for tomorrow, you know, you're in this in this trading channel."
"26949100","26951080"," It's been trading down since the 15th."
"26951080","26952560"," The bears are like, no, fuck you. "
"26952640","26953080"," We're out of here."
"26954040","26956760"," I think we go back to the real scene above it for 32."
"26959240","26961440"," And probably in the overnight they'd have to do it. "
"26961440","26964880"," If they don't do it in the overnight, it's going to be tough to get there in the cash market"
"26964880","26965280"," tomorrow."
"26966180","26971800"," So the bears have a couple of good things rolling for them into tomorrow to take this back down"
"26971800","26972820"," again for a retest."
"26974120","26978340"," The futures would have to trade it up to get us to 432. "
"26979560","26982060"," Basically, 432 that the futures have to send us there."
"26985210","26986070"," I'll take that trade."
"26986710","26989730"," I'm not going to take a lot of money, but I'll take it in the overnight just in case. "
"26989730","26991070"," I'm going to wait until 415."
"26991990","26993750"," Those calls are now down to $1,6."
"26993910","26996850"," I haven't bought them yet, but I'm looking for like $1 for those calls. "
"26997510","26999050"," I don't know if I can get them as low as $1."
"27000330","27001790"," Or with a 432."
"27002170","27003910"," And then if we trade sideways and down. "
"27006250","27008170"," If we trade sideways and down."
"27009710","27013930"," Then I would probably be able to buy some of like 60 cents or something or 40 cents tomorrow."
"27014310","27016630"," If we're bullish or cut my losses. "
"27018770","27020570"," You can even do a straddle here into the clothes."
"27020570","27022070"," You could buy some 432s."
"27022790","27023930"," And then you could buy. "
"27024710","27025930"," I got to look back at that chart."
"27027270","27031790"," I just made you could look for 420s."
"27033570","27034590"," Like super duper bear. "
"27034770","27036990"," Or if you're if you're like a want to protect yourself."
"27037730","27038640"," You buy 432 C's."
"27042290","27048150"," And you buy 410s for 15 cents. "
"27055610","27058050"," And you buy I'll buy one by I'm with you right now."
"27060460","27062140"," I was buying well care where we are right now."
"27062140","27062820"," I'm going to buy them there. "
"27062960","27064160"," I'm going to buy them for $1 10."
"27065060","27066240"," I'll take this trade with you."
"27067240","27068640"," Oh, no, maybe it's going cheaper. "
"27069700","27071280"," We're going for $1 7."
"27071940","27072940"," I'm comfortable with that trade."
"27073080","27073860"," I don't care if it goes down."
"27078570","27082310"," In order in for $1 10, maybe should I do $1 10. "
"27083030","27086690"," No, maybe I'll put an order in for $1 5."
"27087050","27090550"," I'm going to put an order in for $1 5 on 432s."
"27093020","27096980"," And then I'm going to grab some 410s."
"27098180","27099240"," And see if. "
"27101080","27103780"," See if we can do a straddle on tomorrow."
"27110800","27111820"," We'll see what happens."
"27113620","27117600"," So we'll see if we can take a trade for 432 C's for tomorrow. "
"27118640","27123400"," And then 410 P's for tomorrow in case we sell overnight."
"27124140","27127240"," If we have a bloodbath overnight, I should be safe."
"27127880","27132000"," It'll pay for I'll only lose like 15 cents if we gap up. "
"27132660","27135700"," And so I'm assuming we'll make more than 15 cents if we gap up."
"27136100","27137620"," So don't give a fine shit about 410's."
"27138340","27143220"," And if we sell off into tomorrow, the products will pay for my lungs. "
"27145260","27146900"," So that's the trade into tomorrow."
"27146900","27147780"," You guys want to trade?"
"27147860","27148220"," It's 408."
"27149880","27155740"," You've got a trade at 410 P for bloodbath tomorrow. "
"27155740","27159600"," We don't know about dirt cheap insurance, 15 cents."
"27160520","27167160"," And then the long is 432 C's for a gap up trade."
"27169240","27171020"," If you make a mistake, you fucked up. "
"27171480","27174460"," This is if you're if you're if you're overall bullish in the tomorrow, I am."
"27174460","27177460"," And we'll see if we can we can."
"27177600","27178560"," I'm bullish for tomorrow. "
"27178560","27180220"," If your viewpoint is where."
"27180900","27185820"," Sure for tomorrow, then take a bunch of cheap puts and only buy one or two calls."
"27186860","27188780"," Or even the calls that equal those puts. "
"27190760","27195320"," Watching some spy or IWM golden tickets."
"27197120","27202100"," March 18th, 188 P for $10 million split three ways sweeps."
"27202700","27210560"," Watch the sweep on March 18th, 405 P for $3.2 million on spy. "
"27210940","27215640"," So just be conscious that after the bell right now, where you are getting some hedging activity"
"27215640","27221320"," coming into the market for a look at 405 by March 18th."
"27221360","27222620"," Right that one down under calendar."
"27224280","27230200"," March 18th, 405, 405. "
"27231080","27236970"," The puts cost $5 each puts coming in the spy currently."
"27245010","27246370"," Yeah, I'm here tomorrow with you guys."
"27246390","27246730"," Of course. "
"27246890","27248190"," Yeah, I wasn't going to be here with you guys."
"27248410","27250290"," I was going to be I had some business to do."
"27250450","27252490"," But my wife's trying to take care of it alone with me right now. "
"27253230","27254410"," I was going to take dude."
"27254510","27255390"," I was going to take off this morning."
"27255390","27258410"," And I was like, there ain't no fucking way I'm taking off this morning. "
"27259370","27262150"," I'm like, we voted on to be taken today off."
"27262170","27263610"," And I'm like, that shit ain't happening today."
"27263870","27264950"," There ain't no fucking way. "
"27266090","27266790"," Sorry to swear."
"27267370","27268730"," Sorry if I dropped an F bomb out there."
"27271170","27273670"," So I'm doing one to one on calls and puts right now. "
"27282700","27286300"," So I did a one to one on spy calls and puts."
"27291770","27294350"," So we'll see if we sell off into this last hour here."
"27295070","27296610"," Looks like the other thing. "
"27296670","27300330"," We got some VIX puts coming in after the bell to February 25th."
"27300770","27305070"," 23.5. $31,000 after the bell."
"27305670","27307190"," That might be a good trade too. "
"27307770","27310670"," Actually, maybe the best trade here is I was talking about doing some spies."
"27311610","27312850"," Just some VIX puts."
"27314250","27315570"," Those bad boys are going to print. "
"27316770","27319310"," February 25th 23.5 CRP."
"27319830","27320850"," $31,000."
"27321910","27322730"," I think they'll print. "
"27323070","27325530"," Even if we trade sideways into tomorrow, it's probably the safest bet."
"27326630","27327750"," VIX puts VXX."
"27329170","27330330"," Probably the best bet in tomorrow. "
"27335460","27336660"," Yeah, have a great day today, guys."
"27337960","27339380"," And we'll see if they sell futures."
"27339740","27340680"," We'll see if we gap down tomorrow. "
"27340940","27341660"," Either way, I'm covered."
"27341860","27345100"," I'm either going to, well, either be flat on this trade or make money in this trade."
"27345800","27347340"," But I'll tell you one thing, I'm losing money in that trade. "
"27347440","27348000"," I don't think I am."
"27348860","27349420"," So we'll see."
"27352280","27353240"," I'll see you guys tomorrow. "
"27353240","27357760"," I'll see you reporting a 4.0 billion revenue, just being a 4 billion consensus."
"27358400","27359060"," Sierra, go back."
"27360000","27365700"," I'll check back with you guys tomorrow at least 9 a.m. I'll try to get here at 8.30."
"27366060","27367240"," There's anything wild in the market. "
"27367360","27369500"," If you guys see the market, sell the fuck off in the middle of the night."
"27370100","27371300"," Anything crazy like that."
"27371660","27373360"," I will get back to you in the morning. "
"27374220","27375180"," That's split trade too."
"27375320","27377060"," We'll manage that trade together tomorrow."
"27377560","27380520"," If we sell off in the middle of the night, right, you can do is just cut the puts loose"
"27380520","27384760"," at the bell and then you hold on to the call side and you add to that side. "
"27385320","27386920"," And you'll make even more money than breaking even."
"27390800","27392720"," Yeah, thanks to you guys for showing up today."
"27392740","27393320"," I appreciate it. "
"27394860","27396080"," Good to see all of you guys."
"27396860","27400600"," For vlog, just to give you us a 27 cents would be an 8 cent beat."
"27400840","27402280"," Again, revenue, slight beat for SQ. "
"27403360","27404840"," Yeah, so into the close here."
"27405540","27409100"," We should trade down into 4.15. Like right at 4.15 by ourselves."
"27409800","27414980"," Some 4.32 C's and some 4.10 P's expiring tomorrow. "
"27415740","27417180"," We'll see if there's a move in the overnight."
"27417360","27420860"," There should be a move either up or down into tomorrow."
"27421620","27422720"," I don't think we trade sideways. "
"27423960","27425400"," Don't follow me in these trades."
"27425620","27426700"," That is not financial advice."
"27427280","27431040"," I don't want you guys to ever come back on here later and saying, Hey, Cap, we lost all our"
"27431040","27431300"," money. "
"27431760","27433140"," Anything insane like that either."
"27433740","27436220"," So you guys have to do your own due diligence."
"27436900","27438800"," There's better trades out there than those. "
"27439380","27440260"," Lots better trades."
"27440400","27442100"," You could just do, you know, be a trade for today."
"27442180","27443020"," You want to trade isn't it?"
"27443240","27444600"," Well, right now, they last two minutes. "
"27445880","27447000"," Probably just the butterfly."
"27448900","27449720"," More than likely."
"27450180","27452380"," We're not going to trade outside of a range tomorrow. "
"27453600","27456340"," But for me, I'm expecting a gap up."
"27456480","27460400"," If I don't get that gap up tomorrow, the puts will save the initial investment, hopefully."
"27465270","27466570"," You guys have a wonderful afternoon. "
"27466930","27470450"," We know we're not going to win every trade out here, but we do try to win some big ones."
"27473010","27474250"," You guys have a wonderful afternoon."
"27475130","27475870"," Thanks, Robert, brother. "
"27475970","27476530"," Take it easy, bro."
"27477430","27479370"," I want to give a special thanks to Matt P."

"27489810","27491990"," I appreciate all of you out there being here with me. "
"27492650","27493850"," We'll trade this market together."
"27495150","27497750"," Not financial advice, definitely."
"27499410","27500570"," You guys have a great afternoon. "
"27500570","27503010"," I've got some tickers I've got to work on for some of you guys."
"27503210","27506330"," I'll start popping these out on Twitter tonight."
"27510130","27510850"," 4-14. "
"27511570","27513050"," We have one more minute to the bell."
"27513310","27516550"," I haven't seen too much more come in right now, just out just all those hedges."
"27517230","27518990"," Seems logical to hedge the market here. "
"27520050","27521470"," I've got a hedge on the market for tomorrow."
"27521690","27522210"," And I've got some calls."
"27523210","27524450"," We'll see what happens in tomorrow. "
