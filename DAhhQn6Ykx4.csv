"31600","32300"," Check one."
"43310","44070"," Check check. "
"45270","54960"," If you look at"
"54960","61160"," capital in the U.S. and I look at the globally significant banks here versus other places in the"
"61160","66800"," world with the state of the U.S. banks, the U.S. G-Sibs are better capitalized than their global"
"66800","68660"," peers in Europe or in Asia."
"70240","73640"," So we're certainly at or near the top of the league table."
"74020","78920"," I think there are a couple other jurisdictions that also have broadly similar levels of capital"
"78920","80840"," strength, but yes, we're at the top of the league table. "
"81220","87840"," I looked at it this morning and U.S. G-Sibs have 11.3% capital without any capital."
"87860","88520"," Good morning out there."
"88660","89260"," Can we just say a second here?"
"89520","91260"," A couple of things I got to do. "
"92800","98280"," So would you say that we're better capitalized than the European banks, the European G-Sibs?"
"98720","103880"," I hate to call out the other jurisdictions, but I would say our banks are very strongly capitalized"
"103880","107380"," and also competing quite successfully globally outside the United States."
"107440","107920"," Yeah, I agree."
"108080","109400"," And I think we've strengthened capital. "
"109820","115000"," We've strengthened our supervision, notwithstanding the problems that we saw this spring, which"
"115000","116780"," we've talked about ad nauseam here."
"116780","121480"," But that capital standard does make American banks, I think, stand out."
"122000","127699"," It wouldn't basil, the so-called Basil III holistic reforms, would it be better if the European"
"127699","132360"," banks did a holistic review and actually got their capital up to American standards?"
"132640","132960"," Morning, everybody. "
"133120","133840"," How's it right here this morning?"
"134140","139880"," They're bound by the same, no one's bound by these, but they were, you know, have agreed to follow"
"139880","142820"," the same standards, and I think they're going through the same process we're going through."
"143520","152340"," Same topic, are the FDIC supervisory process and the OCC supervisors, are they involved and engaged"
"152340","157640"," with Vice Chair Barr in looking at this quote holistic review of capital adequacy?"
"158320","164940"," In other words, are they providing their input to the Vice Chair for supervision in their own views"
"164940","165640"," on this topic?"
"165640","172120"," On the regulatory proposals that are relevant to them, yes, I think on the capital proposals, yes,"
"172120","172700"," I believe so."
"173240","174880"," Can we just one moment here?"
"175060","177780"," If you're just showing up, I have a couple things I've got to do in the background here. "
"177840","183240"," You see rules and supervisor rules consistent over time, and I think that's frustrating here."
"183360","184660"," We see change in administration."
"185060","189240"," Sometimes we see change in rules, which is, I think, frustrating to the private sector and to"
"189240","190060"," market participants. "
"190060","197160"," I note that the Biden administration says that the financial stability oversight board should now"
"197160","200840"," base their decisions on size, as opposed to activities."
"201360","202220"," All right, good morning."
"202360","203180"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"203700","206660"," Activities designation, some selling this morning. "
"207100","214460"," The activities designation gives supervisors more discretion at FSOC to select."
"214460","216280"," We'll take a look here."
"217120","218180"," Under their supervision. "
"219040","220300"," I actually think that."
"221280","225440"," In other words, as size alone, should we be looking only at size or should we look at?"
"225560","228280"," I've got good down movement inside the market right now."
"228320","230500"," We didn't quite get up into the close yesterday. "
"230780","232040"," They tried to sell this down."
"232180","237680"," A big slap down into the close that we did open this morning quite nicely and then boom started"
"237680","240040"," selling down automatically into the open."
"240040","243920"," We still have the hedge on the market for Jerome Powell this morning. "
"244420","248600"," I'm going to look for another bounce here this morning and then a continuation to the downside."
"248820","256740"," Hopefully, we can get down to that daily trigger that daily triggers moved up now to four 27 and"
"256740","257260"," some change."
"257760","259279"," I think it will get a really quick. "
"259279","260980"," I got this rate."
"262440","267940"," Williness to trigger a recession in order to get inflation to two percent."
"268320","270040"," Yeah, four thirty seven and change. "
"270540","272740"," An accurate interpretation."
"273440","275240"," Right up here is your DT."
"275720","281220"," Place stability and maximum employment and we are dedicated using our tools to achieving those in"
"281220","281780"," the case of. "
"282060","283440"," So you can see it here."
"283440","286940"," We have historically low unemployment rates and high employment rates."
"287120","288580"," This is your daily trigger right here. "
"288700","292920"," This would be hope would be we get down here at least inflation target."
"292920","295260"," Here's my price target down here for 30."
"295700","297740"," This is where the date DT is. "
"298120","301880"," Maybe we can even get down even farther down here to this daily trigger."
"302520","309100"," The impact of rising interest rates on LMI communities and small businesses."
"309900","312320"," When determining monetary policies. "
"313860","316700"," So we only have one interest rate to raise or lower."
"317520","321440"," Mainly one main interest rate to raise or lower and it applies to everyone."
"321700","327240"," But I would say that inflation hits LMI communities and people generally at the low. "
"327260","330440"," We are trading below the hourly trigger the one in the five minute."
"330700","334520"," We should as long as we stay underneath this five minute trigger here this morning."
"334520","339140"," We should be able to continue to sell down off of this four thirty five seventy. "
"340100","345580"," We can also trade back up here to this four thirty six seventy four more downside."
"346440","348920"," We are flattening out slightly right now."
"351320","359160"," Well, they are the same people that are having a hard time accessing loans. "
"359960","361360"," The same with small businesses."
"362400","363420"," Chair Powell."
"363680","365580"," Vice chair bars report. "
"366060","366960"," Target for today."
"367320","368840"," This is asked to down here at least."
"370000","371680"," Four thirty three forty. "
"372100","376920"," In conducting response to S twenty twenty one fifty five."
"377520","382040"," There was also and this is the part that really concerns me."
"382280","383020"," Morning big area. "
"383520","383680"," Yeah."
"383840","384900"," No surprises so far."
"384980","386080"," I've been listening in this morning. "
"386420","387860"," Couple programming notes."
"387860","394360"," First off, if you are in the discord, my name has changed this morning."
"394580","398340"," I was offered a regular name or a name without numbers. "
"398780","401080"," I tried to get captain Jim James."
"401440","402020"," It's unavailable."
"402740","407320"," So I did change my name to the real captain Jim James. "
"407860","409100"," That's a permanent name change."
"410100","414240"," So the real captain Jim James is my permanent name and discord."
"415020","419600"," So if you get any DMS or anything like that and you're going to check my the not the user"
"419600","427420"," name or the user name will be the real captain Jim James my display name stays the same supervision"
"427420","429840"," and also regulation for banks of that size. "
"430120","432820"," Someone in discord says they grabbed the name for me."
"433060","434060"," Is that for real?"
"435660","436880"," It's possible I guess."
"437120","437400"," Let me check. "
"438460","439820"," Let me sign in right now."
"440380","441460"," I was signed in earlier."
"441680","441980"," Hold on. "
"443120","444760"," You know who said that in discord."
"446540","449460"," I can't really characterize it that way."
"449560","449780"," Certainly. "
"449980","451220"," You're in the general chat right now."
"452520","454080"," I tried to use the."
"454380","456140"," I'll go to general chat right now and ask. "
"457120","457600"," Respect."
"458400","463120"," I'm sure that the people who wrote the report were accurately reporting what they what they heard"
"463120","463740"," from back."
"464120","465100"," Here I am. "
"465560","466520"," See trading shorts."
"468600","473340"," I you know I reasonably frequently we you know we set quite near each other."
"473400","473920"," That's powerful. "
"474340","477740"," SBB shows the more over science of mid-size lenders is needed."
"478240","479880"," I didn't say that."
"480360","484740"," But I don't someone say that they got my they gave me the name or someone snagged"
"484740","496180"," my"
"496180","496500"," name. "
"497620","498300"," Well."
"500720","503500"," I said I had no part in preparing the report."
"503860","504300"," I'm I'm. "
"504680","504860"," Yes."
"506120","508340"," The staff who worked on the report."
"508740","509260"," Oh dude. "
"509640","510240"," Baller."
"511780","513460"," So what steps."
"514000","516980"," Hold on one second here. "
"520700","526260"," I think we're taking significant steps now we're we're as you know under vice chair bars"
"526260","526620"," leadership."
"526620","529760"," We're looking carefully at these events and asking ourselves."
"530120","534200"," What do we need to do for with supervision and I don't. "
"535880","537940"," There are situations in which we need."
"538000","538920"," I can't believe that."
"538980","540460"," That's so awesome sauce. "
"540500","542480"," I was panicking this morning."
"542840","546040"," I was so panicking this morning."
"546040","547260"," I'm so stoked right now. "
"547400","551440"," I was in full panic mode this morning about my my name."
"552840","558140"," That someone had taken it and a member snagged it for me."
"558280","558960"," I'm so stoked. "
"560260","562740"," I was in so much panic this morning."
"563420","565140"," I was on phone calls."
"565460","567920"," I was talking to revology this morning about it. "
"569360","572820"," That's so rad like super stoked."
"573900","576100"," Failure a result of the liquidity issue."
"577260","578820"," I'm super super stoked. "
"578900","580040"," Thank you for grabbing my name."
"580960","582960"," Failure the result of a liquidity issue."
"583720","584680"," Hell yes. "
"585260","588540"," Also a lot of very bad management decisions and being made here."
"588780","589480"," Hold on a second."
"589580","590220"," I get something to do. "
"590360","593280"," Is that a failure result of a liquidity issue also."
"594420","595400"," Among other things."
"595660","595720"," Yeah. "
"595840","597120"," I mean I wouldn't say just just liquidity."
"597120","598240"," All right."
"598840","603700"," Were any of them a failure of having two low capital levels?"
"604240","606420"," Let's go to Silicon Valley bank. "
"607980","616660"," The issue that triggered the run initially was the presence of significant losses in their"
"617820","618700"," securities portfolio."
"619780","622920"," That is a capital issue."
"624040","628740"," So because they had too low a capital for the requirements. "
"629100","632360"," They weren't required to take that into account."
"632720","641600"," This user inside of Discord said that hey says, you know, dude, Discord prompted me to grab my"
"641600","642800"," unique username this morning."
"643080","644960"," They're doing away with the numbers at the end. "
"645180","649600"," I saw another couple servers, some assholes taking usernames of the mods and owners before they got"
"649600","649920"," them."
"650580","651740"," So I've done it to you."
"651960","652260"," LOL. "
"652600","655560"," But trying to help you so you can get it when you're promoted to change yours."
"656360","658600"," My attempt at contributing around here."
"659080","659760"," Oh, bro. "
"659940","660140"," You're getting."
"660440","661600"," I got something for you."
"661680","662260"," I got a special. "
"663140","666080"," I got I got I got I have something special for you."
"666580","672700"," You're going to get a you're going to get a gift from Captain Jim James for doing that."
"673240","674780"," I was really paranoid this morning. "
"674800","677860"," I was like kind of like scared and running around going."
"677860","678300"," Oh, shit."
"678380","678960"," What am I going to do?"
"680540","682280"," So I'm very grateful here. "
"682780","683220"," Absolutely."
"684480","686740"," And I'd seen that my name was gone."
"687360","688720"," Wasn't available this morning. "
"688720","690760"," So I was like, what the fuck am I going to do here?"
"691760","693380"," I know some kind of stoked."
"695220","696840"," Right on, right on, right on."
"698100","699780"," You still stand by those things. "
"699900","700740"," I mean, just said it today."
"700860","701580"," I can't believe it."
"702480","703780"," Dude, right on. "
"707120","709480"," I was having some issues this morning."
"709720","710160"," Similar."
"710620","711400"," Similar things. "
"712860","713720"," With discord."
"714200","716500"," And we also have some other cool information for you."
"716680","720200"," We have the beta tool or one of the tools. "
"720280","720960"," We got a bunch tools."
"721920","724360"," We've got a beta test for a tool this morning."
"724360","725580"," What's afternoon at some point. "
"726040","728260"," And we're going to be ready to launch that."
"728460","733460"," The next coming days like day to something like that will beta test it with all of you that are"
"733460","734960"," interested in beta testing it."
"735600","737020"," So look forward to that. "
"737260","738760"," And you increase above these levels."
"738960","742100"," It's complete supposedly from what I've been told."
"742360","745400"," And later this afternoon. "
"746480","748260"," I may have to leave the stream."
"748300","749640"," I'll leave the stream up for you."
"749800","757240"," But at some point today it's possible that I'll be pulled away to work on that tool with one of"
"757240","757700"," the developers. "
"758900","760880"," So we've got that coming soon."
"760880","765320"," Like next week this week next week something like that you should have access to it."
"765960","767780"," I have the white paper done for it. "
"768300","771420"," For what we found from it will let you guys be able to use it."
"772160","774240"," For free for at least a week or so."
"775220","777880"," Before we launch it publicly to the rest of the general public. "
"778560","780560"," And you guys can tell me what your."
"781980","783040"," Thoughts on it are."
"783220","783560"," Does it work?"
"783760","784280"," Does it not work?"
"784420","787500"," What would you like to see back tested that kind of stuff. "
"787500","790200"," Among the agencies and then voted on."
"790320","793540"," And then it will be it will take some years to come into full effect."
"793800","794540"," So I would think. "
"794940","799140"," Whereas interest rates for example have immediate effects on financial conditions."
"799200","801740"," And then reasonably quick effects on economic."
"802120","803120"," Price target down below. "
"803360","804900"," Here's S2 right here for you."
"805080","807340"," More sort of medium term longer term."
"807460","810680"," If a pivot point at four three three five nine. "
"810900","814540"," And then another another pivot down here at four three three one three."
"814540","818080"," Maybe not just the tag of the art."
"818300","821020"," You notice how he did have nice sell right off this five minute. "
"821800","824600"," We should come back down here and tag this down here."
"824700","828120"," Higher capital requirements come at a cost and could have significant impact in the US economy."
"828760","833540"," I discussed this with vice chair bar last month and he and expressed my concerns about what the"
"833540","835200"," impact of increased capital in the real economy. "
"835760","837320"," But he didn't answer the question."
"838580","839020"," Directly."
"840640","847040"," We just need to we're hearing from all sorts of industry that these increased capital requirements"
"847040","851760"," at any level would have a further tightening on lending. "
"852540","855120"," And if that happens and I'm hearing from everybody."
"855640","858700"," If that happens we're it's it's going to be a real disaster."
"859400","864540"," So we I think anything that the committee proposes if you could come back and brief us on before"
"864540","865120"," it's finalized. "
"866020","867440"," We would appreciate that very much."
"867440","868280"," Canadian dollar."
"868560","869820"," Gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen. "
"869820","873440"," One hundred three one seven six per US dollar."
"874220","874580"," Welcome."
"875140","875960"," Mr Chairman. "
"876280","877120"," Thank you very much."
"877420","885360"," This is probably economics one on one but a lot of people in my district are misunderstanding."
"886660","888540"," One on one along with me. "
"889520","892080"," Yeah, I can't wait for the paper."
"892080","901060"," I've been working on it with Winky, looking at behaviors, it's almost done, I keep adding to it, I"
"901060","906980"," have a few more additions they have to do to it, and what we'll do with the paper is, I"
"906980","911800"," don't know if we should, I don't know if we make it, I got to figure out a way to"
"911800","921420"," release the paper so that you guys can add your own notes to it maybe, or submit"
"921420","928180"," notes to it, let me see if I can figure out a way for, maybe I released the white paper"
"928180","935480"," and a discord channel and then you add your own notes to that discord channel and then we'll will"
"935480","940820"," update it and edit it to match what we're finding and what you're finding."
"941340","944080"," In other words, the job openings decline. "
"944300","947700"," You're saying submit notes via Google form?"
"949180","953680"," I'm wondering if there was any expectation that this would have, this would occur."
"955100","960940"," There is an expectation that the level of the ratio of job openings to unemployed people has been"
"960940","969620"," at in history, all-time highs for, and I'm going to make videos that coincide with the tools so"
"969620","974670"," that you can say hey what is an example of this happening?"
"976010","977530"," So there will be a video series."
"979770","985090"," Yeah the notes will be peer reviewed, you figure it would start like this, like there would be the"
"985090","991350"," white paper would be posted in discord and then you guys would make a note and you're like hey I"
"991350","997790"," noticed this or this doesn't work or this does work, go through your separate notes and then add"
"997790","998930"," them to the white paper. "
"999630","1003370"," It wouldn't be like all-terrible or editable by anyone."
"1006050","1011670"," I have a good friend who has a number of barbecue restaurants in town."
"1011690","1012510"," Yeah through SharePoint. "
"1013710","1020770"," He is stoked right now I'm like I can't I'm like super stoked that you guys are gonna, the cool"
"1020770","1026170"," part about this is that you guys are gonna be able to do this and on your own and I'm"
"1026170","1034630"," quite excited and then we've got some really cool stuff that are, we've got some predictive"
"1034630","1040790"," stuff for like you can look like in the future when this is gonna happen and when that's gonna"
"1040790","1041730"," happen and that kind of stuff."
"1041849","1048230"," To be particularly true, mind outlining the basics of book."
"1048510","1056010"," So book map basics, I only use it for, I only use book map as like an order book, order"
"1056010","1059050"," flow, DOM, DOM and that kind of stuff. "
"1059110","1065570"," So you've got, so you understand how thick the board, the book is for buy sell orders."
"1066350","1073170"," It's really the only reason that I use it here is that's a quick visual representation of where buy"
"1073170","1074310"," and sell orders are."
"1075350","1083610"," ES seems to be the most accurate order book. "
"1084170","1093190"," If you look at like spy or cash market buy sell or standing orders they tend to be on the"
"1093190","1094430"," zeros and fives."
"1094810","1099450"," They show a lot of computer buy sell orders."
"1099450","1104090"," So you're like okay I already know that everything's at zero and fives on stock tickers. "
"1104250","1111130"," ES seems to give the clairs picture as to strength with with supply and demand."
"1112490","1120010"," So if you see thin or if you see white or light blue that's a thinner book."
"1120290","1123330"," The thicker book is where you see yellows and reds. "
"1124410","1132650"," It also gives an idea of the option market to where call and put walls are."
"1134190","1136070"," That's how how thick the book is."
"1136070","1141630"," Do we have expansion to the upside of expansion of the downside and calls and puts to the darker"
"1141630","1143270"," the book is the more black it becomes. "
"1144350","1146170"," That's where the gaps are and that kind of stuff."
"1146470","1147910"," It's very simple."
"1154930","1161630"," I they they didn't work enough for my and my own experience for the amount of money that I paid. "
"1163030","1172190"," They didn't work to I was relying upon them and I would get that would get nailed in a trade"
"1172190","1173030"," like nailed."
"1174470","1177330"," We thought they may have come farther along in time."
"1177330","1184070"," I know that this I wasn't early adopter book map so the general one from California miss Kim has"
"1184070","1190830"," recognized the key or the best thing that I've found from using book map is the visual"
"1190830","1194070"," representation for you to know hey is this a decent bottom. "
"1194230","1199530"," Is this a place where you can expect it to hold or grind through or stop or whatever."

"1211690","1218290"," I could run a series with in with as a spot like a sponsored set of videos with book map"
"1218290","1221690"," because I do have experience using a full suite on book map."
"1223290","1224550"," We could do that. "
"1225350","1228070"," It's possible and that we've talked about it."

"1233970","1236930"," With capital standards it's always a trade-off. "
"1237230","1242550"," The more capital means more stable, more sound, more resilient banking system."
"1242870","1243390"," Now the numbers."
"1243650","1244550"," These aren't dumb questions. "
"1245150","1249650"," The numbers are at 4400 because you have different products."

"1266210","1271410"," I think the clearest book map is ES."
"1272790","1277890"," It gives the clearest the bulk of commercial support and resistance."
"1280010","1281650"," So is the fat thinking?"
"1281730","1283850"," Yeah there's no there's no stupid questions. "
"1284050","1285130"," You can ask any question you like."

"1295390","1299750"," That's a CMD prices and supply disruptions are inflation rest."
"1300130","1304190"," A good portion of the commercial real estate loans are held in smaller banks."
"1305350","1307510"," And UPST until we got it. "
"1308710","1310790"," It's particularly banks that have a high concentration."
"1311670","1314650"," That's what we look for among the smaller banks and there are some of those."
"1315070","1321040"," If I can love UPST or UPST isn't that the one isn't isn't upstart the one where like the guy"
"1321040","1322880"," was like on CNBC. "
"1324160","1328380"," They're like why are you by or what is UPST the dude the guy goes what the fuck do I"
"1328380","1329780"," care it's just going up."
"1330220","1334080"," I don't give a fly and fuck what it's doing."
"1336200","1343840"," Are those procedures that govern consideration and potential adoption of matters like I thought"
"1343840","1344740"," that was a great answer. "
"1345000","1348120"," I think that's how he answered right or do you seem like he's caught off guard maybe."
"1348420","1349820"," Usually I just don't know what they do."
"1350140","1356660"," So on regulation as opposed to supervision on regulation the board of governors votes on regulatory"
"1356660","1357440"," proposals. "
"1357820","1358780"," Yeah that's what it was right."
"1359060","1360880"," Why are you buying it because it's going up."
"1362040","1364820"," That was great. "
"1366340","1368880"," Yeah I'm bullish on UPST here."
"1368880","1378600"," So I'm looking for a buy on it right now at 2886 and a DC at 2334 but still overall"
"1378600","1379380"," bullish on it."
"1379380","1381700"," It's got a great it's got a nice cross on it. "
"1382000","1388800"," Not only that when you have a cross like this I made a post on fin to it about rocket"
"1388800","1396420"," lab and I was trying to show something called a kiss play on rocket lab."
"1396760","1401060"," So let's look at the we'll look at the tool right now as an example."
"1401920","1405940"," In touch with the highest levels of leadership at the White House and the Treasury. "
"1406860","1411320"," The governor also much 12 bring this over for you."
"1411420","1412640"," So UPST is a good example."
"1413120","1416360"," So you've got UPST right. "
"1416700","1418780"," There's a few things I want you to know."
"1419020","1426040"," Number one with respect to their business and like a rubber band this so this orange right here is"
"1426040","1426600"," the weekly."
"1426600","1434960"," So when the reserve this orange right here is is the weekly trend right and price is attracted to"
"1434960","1435100"," it. "
"1436560","1437940"," Two weekly trend."
"1438500","1439460"," What's close to that right."
"1439600","1442460"," Price is attracted to weekly trend. "
"1443640","1450300"," Weekly trend here trending down or any other weekly trend here trending up right."
"1452120","1453040"," Fairly simple."
"1453920","1455660"," No not hard to understand. "
"1456980","1466000"," Now another characteristic of momentum and specifically weekly trend is that if we get a price"
"1466000","1472980"," cross above on the hourly the daily the one in the five minute which you can see happened here"
"1472980","1473400"," right."
"1473560","1476180"," I have nothing I have to price cross above."
"1477200","1480900"," There's another characteristic that you're looking for on a stock ticker. "
"1481220","1485960"," A major thing would be that after the initial rip face above."
"1486800","1487660"," Thank you chairman."
"1487760","1494960"," You want to see a check on at least the daily sometimes even the weekly but mostly the daily is"
"1494960","1495880"," what you're looking for. "
"1496960","1503440"," Successful one in of that and when you look at tickers that do have a successful defense of their"
"1503440","1504260"," daily trigger."
"1505620","1515220"," It leads usually to a huge continuation to the upside and that is due to the confirmation here that"
"1515220","1517000"," yes in fact we are going higher."
"1517300","1524220"," So we want to see what the behavior is down here on UPST. We want to see how it behaves"
"1524220","1525560"," against this daily trigger."
"1526420","1531880"," So what we'll do here is we're going to set up with that in mind a buy down here as"
"1531880","1535660"," a matter of fact it wouldn't be shocked if it gets bought immediately right now that it doesn't"
"1535660","1538500"," even check 29 14."
"1539140","1543200"," It is entirely possible that it just gets bought here. "
"1544840","1547040"," We want to see what happens here."
"1547100","1548160"," So I'm going to show you a few things."
"1549580","1555360"," We know that we have a high double top people say that's a double top is all over for you"
"1555360","1555760"," to PSC. "
"1556280","1561980"," But you want to see what the what happens here what the what the stewardship of the dollar as a"
"1561980","1562140"," currency."
"1562480","1563360"," We don't think I'm down here."
"1563580","1569700"," Come down here and slam into this right and we start to consolidate for an eventual move higher. "
"1571420","1578180"," We don't want to see this break down here this $29.00. If there is a moment where we can"
"1578180","1579360"," buy it lower we will."
"1579500","1583900"," Federal Reserve's core mission is to keep employment up and inflation down."
"1584680","1587740"," Although I understand the calls for climate related financial risk man. "
"1587860","1595000"," What I do want you to know is that if we begin to reject below $23.00 that's no bueno."
"1595260","1603860"," So if you see anything like a break below and like one and one and two and we begin to"
"1603860","1606120"," sell that's a no-go."
"1606340","1612000"," This is really bad for UPST. Other than that it's by the dip with stops underneath."
"1612520","1614820"," You do not want to see anything like this."
"1615840","1623420"," UPST to me though is extremely bullish and this move here is not only bullish but whenever it comes"
"1623420","1630200"," back and actually tests that daily it should make a substantial move higher. "
"1631020","1636800"," Some price targets on UPST. Capital and financial institutions would have a great impact on local,"
"1637180","1638640"," state, federal and even globally."
"1638840","1646580"," Oh yeah look at that up there and these sellers here are to be expected right. "
"1647100","1652980"," You've got some trapped sellers and they've probably been in this stock since a significant amount"
"1652980","1653840"," of time here right."
"1654040","1659120"," May have 22 and you've even got bigger sellers up here."
"1659240","1667440"," You've got people that are still to this day either stuck in it or just want out until they get"
"1667440","1671920"," their price to be like that's it just get me out of this shit. "
"1672480","1674620"," They don't care they just want out right."
"1674860","1677040"," Another one right there."
"1677880","1679320"," Huge huge. "
"1680040","1682580"," Now does UPST actually go that high?"
"1683000","1684640"," I don't know that it does."
"1685060","1686760"," My target personally."
"1687220","1689660"," Probably the $78 up here. "
"1690140","1692040"," $80 for the day."
"1692220","1693620"," Resisting the two years of decline."
"1693980","1696460"," Oh you've had a couple of questions already on on capital. "
"1696660","1697840"," You can see it right there."
"1698640","1703140"," Look some of the some of the current views are that raising back."
"1703140","1705860"," Can I see it's a monthly probably less than that. "
"1706000","1707920"," Let's call it 70 by the time you get there."
"1710520","1719780"," What's your view of the current desire or mode of Vice Chair Barr to fully implement the Basel 3"
"1719780","1720900"," capital standards?"
"1722440","1727800"," I think that's the next thing Vice Chair Quarles was working on that."
"1727940","1733160"," It didn't it didn't get completed for various reasons but that you know I think that's a that's an"
"1733160","1738160"," international capital standard that we should go ahead and complete as to the level of the right"
"1738160","1741300"," level of capital that's a that's a discussion we're about to have. "
"1742060","1746940"," Are you guys at the federal you guys kind of concerned about the fact that now it seems like you"
"1746940","1749460"," know the European regulators are starting to pull back from that."
"1749840","1753540"," Like they're starting to think about capital standards being too much for European banks and that"
"1753540","1757220"," they're starting to receive from from what was I assume you know."
"1757220","1762120"," So yeah about 70 it's about 70 bucks on UPST would be what I'd be looking for. "
"1762400","1767380"," Right around there overall respect the capital."
"1767520","1768360"," I mean let's take a step back."
"1769260","1777020"," I also want you to see here in 2009 we have in my view aggressively gone to this process of"
"1777020","1778200"," increasing capital standards. "
"1778200","1783320"," I also want you to see here that now you're going to get access to this tool right."
"1784360","1785980"," Let me show you some."
"1787700","1792320"," Or price comes down here right tags the daily trigger here. "
"1793020","1794860"," There I still wouldn't enter it."
"1795060","1797700"," Once you get access to this tool you wouldn't enter it either."
"1798340","1807260"," You'd be waiting for the daily for the hourly trigger to come down for price to show you the way"
"1807260","1807540"," higher. "
"1808480","1811660"," So you'd be looking for a bounce you still wouldn't enter the trade."
"1812420","1814600"," You would be looking for a break above the hourly."
"1816100","1824900"," And then for the hourly to carry the carry price back above on the ticker. "
"1825080","1828240"," So you'll have access to that the next few days."
"1828240","1832060"," So you'll be able to take a look at this and watch for price to be above."
"1832220","1833560"," And I want you to see it back here. "
"1833980","1839000"," So you'll see how price is below the hourly and you'll see how the price is above the hourly."
"1839520","1842140"," And you can actually see the hourly heading higher right."
"1842260","1843940"," You can actually see the green going up. "
"1844400","1846480"," And now you see the green going down."
"1846980","1850960"," And if you see the green going sideways price begins to get above it."
"1851100","1854000"," You'll see price continue to go higher with the hourly trigger. "
"1854520","1861340"," So right now not a buy but if we watch price get tagged this daily trade above the green."
"1861700","1865380"," We'll be looking for more upside on new PST. Move that along. "
"1865680","1869500"," We think that you know the world's not a better place with fewer community banks and we try to we"
"1869500","1874200"," try to keep that in mind in all of the regulatory and supervisory things that we that we do."
"1874500","1884320"," Do you think that federal regulatory policy in part from Congress has led to a supercharging effect"
"1884320","1887020"," of diminished community banking in the United States?"
"1887480","1892400"," It's probably been a factor but I do think there have been important demographic factors as well."
"1892400","1898740"," And also having interstate banking interstate banking only became you know legal quite recently and"
"1898740","1900600"," that also has led to consolidation. "
"1901000","1907020"," So I was asked a question this morning I was asked or I was told that people seem to think"
"1907020","1912180"," that bitcoin will become kind of illegal right."
"1912680","1917800"," You won't be able to purchase it and transfer does anybody else believe that out there or no."
"1918260","1920240"," Still looking to target this down here. "
"1920440","1920840"," 433."
"1921040","1921440"," 59."
"1921600","1921960"," 433. "
"1922780","1922780"," 13."
"1922940","1930400"," I think just having larger financial institutions, larger banks overall with a diminishing smaller"
"1930400","1932620"," community bank infrastructure."
"1933060","1934220"," Does anybody think that about bitcoin?"
"1935580","1937700"," Small businesses, mama pop businesses. "
"1938720","1940020"," It also could be poor."
"1940160","1942980"," I'm hearing all kinds of rumors out there in conjecture."
"1944520","1947940"," I'm like man for for something like that to be true. "
"1947940","1950020"," Why hasn't it gotten to zero?"
"1950240","1950820"," Why hasn't there any panic?"
"1953040","1958440"," Upending custody bank bank custody bank balance sheets and by extension the bank custody model."
"1959100","1962280"," Are you guys are the fed concerned about this proposed rule from the SEC?"
"1970440","1974620"," The gentleman from New York Mr. Torres is now recognized."
"1974620","1976360"," Thank you Mr. Chairman. "
"1976420","1977380"," Thank you Chairman Powell."
"1978480","1983660"," As you know the U.S. has foreign adversaries particularly the CCP that seem intent on de "
"1983660","1984300","-dollarization."
"1984940","1988000"," How seriously should the threat of de-dollarization be taken?"
"1989780","1996080"," Well the United States of the dollar as the world's reserve currency is a very important thing to"
"1996080","1996300"," us. "
"1996660","2002620"," I think the reason we have to ask these videos to fed gifts and unfeds, all those interested."
"2003000","2009080"," The rule of law and the fact that we we have generally speaking had strong levels of price"
"2009080","2013700"," stability and I think that the dollar will remain that the reserve currency as long as those things"
"2013700","2014400"," are in place."
"2015260","2020540"," Well I want to explore that that answer because commentators often speak of the dollars the world's"
"2020540","2021260"," reserve currency. "
"2021740","2026260"," That's just as a way the trade over america's economic bank is under valuable credit of it as the"
"2026260","2029080"," cause of america's economic dominance or as a consequence of it."
"2030060","2035500"," To me it's more of a of a consequence and also it just there tends to be an equilibrium where"
"2035500","2040180"," one currency becomes the the accepted global standard and that has been the dollar for some time"
"2040180","2043260"," and I expect that it will be for some time, continue to be."
"2044040","2047739"," It's often said that the fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. "
"2048360","2053100"," Do you view these mandates as equally binding upon the fed or does one supersede the other?"
"2053739","2055500"," They are perfectly equal under the law."
"2056179","2060400"," And I'm curious to know what it means in practice to have a two percent inflation target."
"2061060","2065840"," The latest pause notwithstanding does it mean the federal reserve will continue raising interest"
"2065840","2068440"," rates until the two percent target is reached. "
"2069100","2069679"," Oh here we go."
"2069820","2074020"," So it comes at the expense of maximum employment as well as financial stability."
"2074940","2076719"," No it doesn't mean that it does not. "
"2077040","2082219"," So the way we think about it is most of the time the two goals are aligned in the sense"
"2082219","2086620"," that if you're if you're achieving one you're achieving the other and if you're a little bit off"
"2086620","2088659"," the other one they move in the same direction."
"2089400","2095560"," Today's situation is unusual in that we are overachieving and affect the maximum employment goal"
"2095560","2098960"," but we are far from achieving the inflation goal."
"2099500","2106120"," So in our system we have a constitutional document and what it says is that when that's the case"
"2106120","2110620"," you look at how far you are from the goal and you look at the speed with which you would"
"2110620","2111480"," move back to the goal. "
"2111700","2118520"," And so that would tell you today that we should focus heavily on inflation but as it becomes closer"
"2118520","2124960"," as you know as the two things become more aligned then they go back into perfect equality under the"
"2124960","2125120"," law."
"2125220","2128960"," So the Fed engages in a delicate balancing act between employment and inflation."
"2129700","2135560"," So what extent do you factor in financial stability, safety and soundness when raising interest"
"2135560","2135860"," rates?"
"2136300","2143200"," So you're right we do have a financial stability mandate but we try to we try to well you have"
"2143200","2148120"," a financial stability mandate with respect to your role as a bank regulator but when it comes to"
"2148120","2152900"," also just generally we're the lender of last resort central banks were originally created to to"
"2152900","2154240"," support the financial system. "
"2154240","2156900"," Yeah you're the auction buyer of last resort too."
"2157280","2164240"," So I would say that sorry what was your question before that was to what extent do you factor in"
"2164240","2165940"," safety and soundness when setting interest rates?"
"2166340","2172240"," Sorry so we we really try hard to use our financial stability tools for financial stability"
"2172240","2178320"," purposes and our monetary policy tools for monetary purposes that the reality on the ground is much"
"2178320","2184380"," messier than that they're very much entangled and one affects the other so the separation is not is"
"2184380","2190080"," not at all perfect but we do think of these as separate separate things with separate tools."
"2190500","2197640"," Do you think that the Silicon Valley bank failure revealed a deeper tension between the safety and"
"2197640","2205180"," soundness mandate of the Fed as a bank regulator and the and the um find the inflate then the"
"2205180","2209440"," mandate of the Fed as a administrator of monetary policy?"
"2209620","2215340"," I would say no and I'll tell you why interest rate risk is you know one of the most basic"
"2215340","2222240"," banking risks we supervise for it overwhelmingly US banks did manage their interest rate risk"
"2222240","2229820"," Silicon Valley bank didn't and even though we you know the supervisors were were pointing that out"
"2229820","2234960"," to them they didn't take you know the bank didn't take action quickly enough so I would have"
"2234960","2241280"," thought that you can say that it was interest rate hikes that caused portfolio losses but it was"
"2241280","2245140"," management that failed to hedge against those losses and failed to hold appropriate liquidity. "
"2246300","2252320"," In the pre-COVID world we have the best of both worlds low unemployment low inflation for decades"
"2252320","2258920"," do you believe that I'm in puts right now the best of both worlds or or high interest rates in"
"2258920","2266620"," new normal in the American economy so we will return to 2% inflation and and maximum employment um"
"2266620","2271440"," do I see any uh trades here so I was asked cap do you see any trades here so my"
"2271440","2277620"," puts cannot find any trade yeah I'm still uh I'm still south side I don't think we're done going"
"2277620","2286960"," down I'm looking for a target down below of 43359 and 43313 here maybe the truth is somewhere in"
"2286960","2292180"," the middle I'm inspired the gentleman from Nebraska Mr. Flood is recognized thank you Mr. Chairman"
"2292180","2297480"," Chairman Powell I'd like to discuss the continued efforts to unwind years and years of quantitative"
"2297480","2302420"," easing and what it's done to our Federal Reserve balance sheet if you take a look at the size of"
"2302420","2307760"," the Federal Reserve's balance sheet since the 2008 financial crisis we've seen an alarming increase"
"2307760","2317240"," from around 800 million to today's 8.3 trillion in assets back in 2018 you did start the work of"
"2317240","2322600"," winding down the balance sheet you managed to offload roughly 700 billion assets between the"
"2322600","2329640"," beginning of your time as Federal Reserve Chair and August of 2019 the problem was shortly after"
"2329640","2334500"," your yeah you just wait until Powell is done as soon as he's done you should see a squeeze at"
"2334500","2342300"," some point once again return hourly trigger is well the five minute is right now at 43650 the H.T."
"2343420","2350020"," is coming down that's how we made it to the balance sheet level that we were at today I understand"
"2350020","2354020"," you have started working to shed some of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and I appreciate the"
"2354020","2360320"," work that being said the scale involved here to me is startling my concern Chairman Powell's"
"2360320","2365520"," efforts to shed assets from the Fed's balance sheet have never been anywhere as quick as efforts to"
"2365520","2370840"," build it back up our economic cycle does go through recessions from time to time it's not always"
"2370840","2375900"," boom but some bus too if we continue a pattern of rapidly building up the Federal Reserve's balance"
"2375900","2382880"," there is H.Y.G. is coming into we're going to see the balance sheet grow significantly over time"
"2382880","2390640"," chairman Powell could see a bounce here in just a minute hold on here long term how can we avoid"
"2390640","2399920"," it depending on H.Y.G. down at any time there's an economic shock 74 40 another six cents or"
"2399920","2407940"," so we're getting close this time the balance sheet roll off is much much faster than it was back in"
"2407940","2412760"," the in the first episode we also know more we hadn't we hadn't grown our balance sheet like that"
"2412760","2417480"," and we hadn't shrunk it before now we have experience with that so we are we're moving back down to"
"2417480","2421980"," a level that will be appropriate for a new framework by the way we won't go back to a framework"
"2421980","2428360"," where we were dealing with scarce reserves that we we like the administrative rate framework that"
"2428360","2433780"," we're in now but it is important that the that the balance sheet not just grow with every cycle and"
"2433780","2439440"," I think I'm very conscious of that chairman Powell do you have an optimal Fed target for the size"
"2439440","2446140"," of what the balance sheet should look like you know a number you know I'll give you the the idea"
"2446140","2455900"," and that is it's you find the number but the idea is that it's smaller than now it's yeah we"
"2455900","2460060"," might get a we make it a squeeze they're coming up next few minutes a little bit of a buffer"
"2460060","2464980"," on top of that so that we don't accidentally run into reserve scarcity demand for reserves can be"
"2464980","2471040"," volatile and you don't want to find yourself as we did a few years back suddenly finding that that"
"2471040","2475580"," reserves were scarce even though we and we didn't see it coming and we had to we then had to"
"2475580","2480960"," you know put more reserves into the system at a time when we didn't want to be doing that so"
"2480960","2486840"," I think you want to have levels a level where we're at ample reserves plus a buffer and you know"
"2486840","2491240"," that'll be a percent of GDP that we get down to and you know we're moving in that direction pretty"
"2491240","2496800"," pretty smartly chairman Powell realistically how quickly can the Federal Reserve unwind its balance"
"2496800","2501700"," sheet what's the threshold beyond which NASA sell off by the Federal Reserve would disrupt our"
"2501700","2507360"," markets so we we don't sell assets what we do is we allow them to mature and passively roll off"
"2507360","2512980"," so we're going to the tune of about a trillion dollars a year and we're in the process now we"
"2512980","2519540"," will as it's an empirical question you're going to find a level that is still ample plus plus a bit"
"2519540","2524400"," of a buffer and that's that's how we're thinking about it thank you mr chairman i would just"
"2524400","2529080"," reiterate my concern on this issue i fear that having the Federal Reserve backstop so much of our"
"2529080","2533940"," economy through the holding of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities is not sustainable long "
"2533940","2539780","-term thank you chairman i yield back gentlemen yields the gentlemen from New York mr horse for or"

"2609100","2615180"," colleagues are dedicated to creating economy that actually works for them which is why i was"
"2615180","2622160"," pleased that last week the federal reserve decided to pause your interest rate hikes and take stock"
"2622160","2627960"," of the overall economic picture now don't get me wrong there's certainly more work ahead of us but"
"2627960","2634540"," with 13 million jobs added since president biden took office we should be rooting for america to"
"2634540","2641080"," succeed and not to fail the strength of the labor market continues despite the multiple concurrent"
"2641080","2646940"," shocks that continue to reverberate throughout the global economy and i believe our economy remains"
"2646940","2653780"," resilient thanks to the historic investments that were included in the legislation past last"
"2653780","2660420"," congress and signed into law by president biden these beneficiaries of these investments were the"
"2660420","2665920"," people the middle class not special interest the bipartisan infrastructure law is creating"

"2684680","2691420"," electric vehicles that will all be made here in america just last week treasury secretary yellen"
"2691420","2696200"," was before this committee and described how the transformational investments from the inflation"
"2696200","2704220"," reduction act are ushering in a renaissance of domestic manufacturing these are good paying jobs"
"2704220","2710140"," union jobs we're getting pretty close there i think we're at 85 minutes now in the broadcast our"
"2710140","2714300"," reliance on goods in place so you figure they'll probably i would think they would stop their"
"2714300","2719500"," testimony right around an hour and a half seems like it seems kind along us again kind of close to"
"2719500","2725800"," the end manual investments in manufacturing construction has more than doubled its pre-pandemic"
"2725800","2730220"," levels furthermore when we narrow the focus that's what i was thinking they're gonna get hungry"
"2730220","2738920"," they have to empty their cloths to me bags and they got a they're gonna change their diapers"

"2745540","2752100"," in modern infrastructure and modern manufacturing facilities they're gonna get hungry that's right"
"2752100","2758020"," so that's what i think i've heard time and again from my constituents about the cost of housing"
"2758020","2764200"," being one of their biggest pain points the monetary policy report points out that housing services"
"2764200","2771720"," prices have risen a shocking eight and a half percent over the 12 month period ending in april and"
"2771720","2778780"," in my district it's even worse so chair kind of too they're saying that things were great in 2019"
"2778780","2787780"," pre-pandemic and that is not the case we were coming into a corrective move in 2019 already"
"2787780","2794120"," so i thought that was kind of odd that he said that housing markets across the country what do you"
"2794120","2800240"," see as the biggest remaining upward pressure on housing services and what can we do in congress to"
"2800240","2806860"," incentivize new home starts to hopefully moderate the imbalance between supply and demand in the"
"2806860","2814940"," housing market i think you're talking about longer run largely longer run factors here and yeah i"
"2814940","2821700"," agree with that too has been for some time a shortage of housing it's harder to get lots it's"
"2821700","2826860"," harder to get workers and so we we've had a housing shortage so we had a housing shortage Jerome"
"2826860","2831040"," Powell right now is saying this has been going on much longer than i think during during the"
"2831040","2836480"," pandemic you had people wanting to live in houses rather than downtown in apartments because of"
"2836480","2843620"," covid rates and so you had two or three years of very very high rating price increases for housing"
"2843620","2849740"," and now that is flattened out a lot as we've raised rates and Philman's time has expired the"
"2849740","2850820"," gentleman from New York mr."

"2852780","2858460"," Chairman pal you the feds vice chairman for supervision and many others have indicated that the"
"2858460","2864780"," banking system is well capitalized bank capitalization remained robust during so i'm going to turn"
"2864780","2871540"," this down briefly here so you know the first thing to say here is that pre you know pre covid"
"2871540","2876920"," we were close to a corrective move we got it from covid so one way or another we did get"
"2876920","2883360"," it the housing crisis uh we we were we were in a housing crisis when we went into the uh"
"2883360","2893240"," 2008 fine great financial crisis it actually created amplified that housing crisis"
"2893240","2899760"," even more i don't remember the exact numbers but i think it will we were at like a um we"
"2899760","2907260"," had a deficiency i believe of 15 to 20 percent and then once we created a new class of renters"
"2907260","2915360"," from the gfc it went to like uh 25 or 30 percent so that that amplified it even more there"
"2915360","2922240"," was even you you remember blackrock getting into building custom homes for rent or rent to own uh"
"2922240","2928160"," in the in recent years the past two or three years hyper aware that people that we would likely"
"2928160","2935460"," create an even larger class of renters from the downturn expected in the market which took place in"
"2935460","2944720"," december 2021 then 2022 2022 for the median household making around 71,000 a year then it's"
"2944720","2950460"," fascinating because if you speak to people from europe uh that's the norm now right especially in"
"2950460","2956520"," the most western nations like england places like that everyone rents and we're creating that class"
"2956520","2963540"," right now in the united states a class of renters the average american family including in the"
"2963540","2969260"," hudson valley now further decreasing the availability of i don't know if you'll get one i you know"
"2969260","2974160"," the weirdest part about that the whole housing crisis too you know someone just commented and they"
"2974160","2981520"," said can we get a housing crisis they tightened the rules so much that a lot of people cannot own"
"2981520","2988460"," homes today they also can't afford them right and which what's insane here is that i've talked"
"2988460","2996640"," about in the program in the past that and these numbers have since come out even after i've said"
"2996640","3002200"," this uh people have said things like can we get well we have another housing crisis and i'm like"
"3002200","3011240"," boy you know like my father was my dad was um a part of the generation that uh would mortgage"
"3011240","3020420"," and re-mortgage and re-mortgage and the last"
"3020420","3030080"," 10 years i've spent buying and renovating homes it was fascinating to see how most people did it"
"3032280","3041920"," was completely different than previous generations hard money loans that where you have let's say"
"3041920","3049380"," six months to renovate and then uh you have you know three months to sell it uh with with with"
"3049380","3054400"," big points on on that money right to borrow that money then most of the guys that i knew doing"
"3054400","3061760"," it uh when they were when they were making money off of flips they continued to then flip that"
"3061760","3069900"," money that cash into buying homes with cash most now a lot of these people i have seen re-mortgage"
"3069900","3076620"," their properties but they have renters in these homes uh they have permanent money coming in on"
"3076620","3084140"," these homes as rental units none of the people that i know are overextended if the market were to"
"3084140","3091160"," crash tomorrow none of these people would be hurt uh with having renters inside these homes that"
"3091160","3097940"," the housing market to me is resilient and here's the worst part the thing that really hurts right"
"3097940","3105840"," now is uh i'll see sometimes i'll see articles and let's say oh we we had a huge downturn in"
"3105840","3111420"," the housing market and i'm like yeah but most guys i know have been buying homes for i mean it"
"3111420","3119240"," really it started 15 to 20 years ago and then it ramped about 10 years might be longer now but"
"3119240","3126880"," it was like about 10 years prior to covid so let's say uh let's call it 2010 chairman according to"
"3126880","3132080"," the they really started ramping so when you're seeing like people say yeah well houses have gone up"
"3132080","3137060"," a hundred percent where i'm at i'm like yeah well the guy down the street me probably bought 10 or"
"3137060","3142660"," 20 years ago those guys are in for nothing in a lot of these houses as a matter of fact"
"3142660","3152380"," a guy grew up with he bought a house in the gfc in las vegas and there's no way today"
"3152380","3158240"," that that house is ever coming back down to where he loses on that home that he bought and the"
"3158240","3164480"," in the gfc so it's even it's even the chat i guess the point of making is even if you"
"3164480","3174380"," had a crisis or a downturn in the economy uh will these people be in pain how do you put"
"3174380","3178920"," them in pain maybe taxation would be the only thing i could think of but that gets passed along to"
"3178920","3187600"," a renter but when i was here in 95 the grateful dad were playing just one of jerry garcy's last"
"3187600","3194060"," concerts and i was just so disappointed that i missed that concert um but was excited to see that"
"3194060","3200900"," the from public reporting that you were at the the most recent deaden co deaden company show i've"
"3200900","3205760"," i've been to this this version with john marean enjoyed it but i you know we we weren't here how"
"3205760","3211800"," was the show did you like it that was terrific what can i say june powell is that a grateful"
"3211800","3219280"," dead show 50 years so well i i've found one universal truth that people i like people who like the"
"3219280","3229220"," grateful dead so so just keep your eye here on the spy if bears cannot it's now"
"3229220","3234200"," 11 30 we are on the on the 11 30 of our want to see if bears can hold this"
"3234200","3239040"," or not if they can't hold this we're going to take a trade upside right here between uh 4 35"
"3239040","3246040"," 36 and 4 36 43 you know back to that show you know a lot of people there in virginia"
"3246040","3253100"," and like my constituents you know they're very concerned about this economy they're worried about"
"3253700","3259740"," you know the cost of groceries rising inflation interest rates going up and and when we do these"
"3259740","3264000"," hearings you know it's always big news the things you say you know move markets and are very"
"3264000","3270520"," important but fed speak is just so hard for my constituents and the american people to understand"
"3270520","3279760"," getting a bounce on nazak getting a bounce on hyg who are concerned bounce on tesla bounce on iwm"
"3279760","3285020"," so i i guess i would say this economy is very broad 4 36 c's driving it now it's just"
"3285020","3290480"," a very strong labor market there's still a significant demand for workers there are more job"
"3290480","3295580"," openings than there are unemployed people wages are moving up and that's really what's driving the"
"3295580","3301760"," economy forward people's disposable incomes are are coming up inflation is moving down gradually"
"3301760","3306560"," the thing that the thing that troubles people and i think the thing that accounts for the surveys"
"3306560","3310960"," you see where despite it you know a historically strong labor market people are still concerned"
"3310960","3316440"," about economy it's really inflation so this is our job is to bring inflation down the way we do it"
"3316440","3322200"," is by raising interest rates and while that can be painful what it does is it it gradually slows"

"4164740","4173880"," get uh like we my oldest right now we're discussing uh college right now and we're on the fence i'm"
"4173880","4180960"," like uh you can get this one degree but you must then go to a graduate school and medical school"
"4180960","4186300"," uh to make a lot of money and you're going to have to pay a lot of money to be"
"4186300","4192220"," that that profession right if you're going to be a doctor or something uh research scientists don't"
"4192220","4198180"," make shit you could get uh there's way easier degrees to get to make 90,000 a year 100,000"
"4198180","4205520"," a year so even even that minefield how do my kids come up with a down payment with where they"
"4205520","4212620"," want to live i don't know what the answer to that is uh i have to assume give them money"
"4214000","4218720"," i assume that it has to be a familial thing right it's it seems like it's coming to that where"
"4219320","4224860"," they won't likely won't be able to pay for university then get out of university and then get paid"
"4224860","4231260"," enough they'll be under the the the yoke of um of call of they i make too much i know"
"4231260","4234700"," that they're not going to they're not going to get a free ride unless their grades are outstanding"
"4234700","4239380"," and they do all this other extracurricular stuff so like i realize that that yoke is there for"
"4239380","4246040"," young people uh so i don't know what the answer is but i know what isn't the answer uh that"
"4246040","4248820"," you know if my daughters are like well i'm just going to live at home and i'm going to bitch"
"4248820","4252080"," and wine or whatever that kind of stuff i shouldn't say bitch and why because it's not pitching and"
"4252080","4260680"," whining they have a legitimate complaint um but exposing yourself to uh where it does work for you"
"4261400","4266840"," might be the key answer to that question right like so if my daughters i'm like yeah you could"
"4266840","4271200"," probably get a medical degree that'll pay you outstanding and then you can consider going to become"
"4271200","4276440"," a doctor later on or if that fails for you or if that doesn't work for you or for you"
"4276440","4281660"," to always take care of yourself i don't want them to have to rely upon a man um to take"
"4281660","4287060"," care of themselves and want my daughters to be able to be self-sufficient right they can make their"
"4287060","4292140"," own decisions in life and not have to rely upon anyone else not to take care of them so it's"
"4292140","4302040"," not an easy thing it's very challenging yeah location is tough man it really sucks because"
"4302040","4307660"," i get it it's like where do you want to live when you ask that question where do you want"
"4307660","4315140"," to live right how much does it cost where you want to live and i realize that it's unaffordable you"

"4621170","4627250"," old people don't tell you is that it sucked for them in a lot of ways uh for whatever it"
"4627250","4632690"," was for them it sucked for them and now that they have what they have they don't want to give"
"4632690","4641390"," it up to you and uh that you should probably take that similar track or else you'll get left behind"
"4643150","4649370"," so though your mommy or your daddy might want you to stay would have that nice place that you live"
"4649910","4657430"," you should probably explore at least the idea of maybe moving somewhere else that's how we had mass"
"4657430","4663090"," migration in the United States when that's not part of all of the reason of mass migration in the"
"4663090","4669490"," United States but people as they came to this country they moved around um and they expanded west"
"4669490","4679370"," right so keeping an open an open eye to that especially if you don't want to be in debt well"
"4679370","4685090"," you can be in debt you can you can live my family lives in San Francisco right they pay for"
"4685090","4688970"," the grind they make a lot of money but they pay for that grind that's where they want to be"
"4688970","4693890"," I've got other friends they they decide to live in New York City but they by a family that uh"
"4693890","4700030"," I have family lives in Boston so that's what they choose to do right um but that's the only advice"
"4700030","4705130"," I can give you that the other side of that story that people aren't telling you is that uh you"
"4705130","4712050"," likely have to find someplace that is affordable someplace that wants you someplace that's like hey"
"4712050","4719790"," your your intelligence you're not a criminal you're not you know you're not you you cared about"
"4719790","4725170"," your schooling you had parents that cared about your schooling you had some support can't make it"
"4725170","4731630"," out there move here we need you so that you can help somebody else that didn't have those"
"4731630","4737370"," opportunities we want you to help that person that uh didn't get a great education or their parents"
"4737370","4750120"," weren't there right well"
"4750120","4754900"," this I mean this is one of the arguments though that let's see like so so lost funds are saying"
"4754900","4759020"," in the past generations didn't get things in credit they saved up for things they wanted and waited"
"4759020","4763540"," and paid cash for things the expectations of the law in many ways they have patients yeah but"
"4763540","4769860"," there's another side of that story too uh taxation was built differently back then too taxes were"
"4769860","4778600"," taken away from very wealthy people and poured into uh you the person that's the uh the pleb uh"
"4778600","4785260"," that our whole tax structure is changed so they are getting fucked like we can't compare the two we"
"4785260","4790280"," have to make sure that we separate the two uh what they have and what these people have they're not"
"4790280","4798120"," the same young people are getting fucked it's it's better for an older person to admit young people"
"4798120","4804520"," are getting fucked uh but also how do they get out of it and the real problem here the real"
"4804520","4811040"," issue here is uh not only are they getting fucked but are they voting like are you voting are you"
"4811040","4816460"," just bitching on the internet they don't you can bitch on the internet but you need to fucking vote"
"4816460","4826440"," and you need to fucking do something about it you need to move somewhere where they you know"
"4826440","4832560"," if you have mass migration of young people to a place that doesn't have residence you're gonna piss"
"4832560","4838880"," off those old people because you didn't contribute to their houses going higher uh i assure you of"
"4838880","4846900"," that uh so if you want to do something for yourself and for your future you leave those places you"
"4846900","4854820"," know if you were to leave these highly uh desired places trust me those old people get pissed"
"4854820","4863740"," because they want you to buy their house that's overpriced yeah you can say that all you want like"
"4863740","4869900"," you you know i'm just one morning yeah this is morning you're like you will wake up one day and"
"4869900","4874420"," you'll you'll wake up one morning and go fuck i never voted fuck i never did something for myself"

"4903560","4908660"," that's all bullshit you can argue about that all day long you can line about it for 10 15 20"
"4908660","4914960"," 30 years assure you that's a high probability not guaranteed that you'll still be saying those"
"4914960","4921580"," things and you'll still be stuck where you started uh you got to do something for yourself and i"
"4921580","4927140"," don't know what the best answer is but i know that the answer i provided a few moments ago is"
"4927140","4932540"," definitely a solution for you it's it's a solution that may might not be the only solution but it's"
"4932540","4940500"," one of them and that you got to do that stuff it's one of the scariest things that i see"
"4940500","4948640"," for my own kids is like i don't i don't think social media is necessarily bad but there can be"
"4948640","4955240"," holes there are traps in social media for young people where they can get on a hole they never"

"4973680","4979420"," you know you got to find a solution for or be able to give an answer for how they solve"
"4979420","4983820"," that rather than just saying you know it's right now it's right now all i see is like here here's"
"4983820","4988920"," a here's a microphone you can bitch into this and so you bitch inside the microphone right you"

"5651480","5657420"," I told you that personally now that you're a deadhead though I'm not quite sure I Can't believe"

"5658600","5662760"," It's two hours in right now Again, thank you very much for being here."
"5662840","5668640"," Appreciate the service you've done for our nation I just want to hear that gavel sweat swing down"
"5668640","5676380"," so we'd go with start ripping right up On both sides actually a one-way call is on our side"
"5676380","5682480"," talked about that and I Was wondering if you saw the headline today in the New York Times about the"
"5682480","5689640"," UK inflation rate and you saw that they're running I think at eight something percent yes, I did"
"5689640","5699640"," see that and You were asked a question by the gentleman on the other side of the aisle that When"
"5699640","5705920"," the Biden administration took over what you could buy for a dollar now cost a dollar 16 and that"
"5705920","5713080"," that was hurting consumers And you said and I want to quote you I strongly agree But the question"
"5713080","5718360"," obviously inferred that inflation was the fault of the Biden administration I mean that that's the"
"5718360","5721020"," whole point of the question I answered by the way."
"5721060","5726600"," I that's right down four pennies right now in 436 See you an opportunity to answer that because you"
"5726600","5734720"," later said that the pandemic was the issue all around the world so is The Biden administration the"
"5734720","5740280"," cause of all this inflation so that just to be clear the question I answered was is is inflation"
"5740280","5741220"," hurting people?"
"5741480","5747280"," It was nothing to do with the cause of the inflation But it's inferred the chairman when you say"
"5747280","5751920"," that This has happened during the time of the Biden administration. "
"5752280","5756420"," I think the question clearly unfurs that I was really I think you Understand the question I was"
"5756420","5762360"," really answering so I guess I would say again You know world people are going to be unpacking the"
"5762360","5768100"," causes of this inflation many many academic careers will be built on New ways to look at this"
"5768100","5772580"," former chairman Bernanke delivered a paper with a colleague just a couple of weeks ago at Brookings"
"5772580","5776660"," on this You know and I just think you see inflation everywhere in the world."
"5776840","5781840"," There's a common factor here, which has to do with the pandemic There's also a room for fiscal"
"5781840","5782360"," policy."
"5782520","5787940"," There's a room for monetary policy in the explanation and I just think it's very hard to unpack"
"5787940","5793780"," that And I wouldn't it's not up to us to make a judgment about we don't render judgment on on"
"5793780","5795760"," fiscal policy We don't support it. "
"5795860","5796700"," We don't criticize it."
"5796860","5799480"," Give me one moment I'm gonna go potty really quick yesterday."
"5799660","5800880"," I got caught not going to the bathroom. "
"5801000","5806620"," So hold on once I'll be right back It's not something we play a role in commenting on or"
"5806620","5811240"," criticizing more praising I wanted to give you an opportunity I appreciate the answer I wanted to"
"5811240","5816220"," give you an opportunity just to make sure if there was any confusion about that the confusion was"
"5816220","5820380"," cleared up And I think you've cleared it up now I want to answer a question that you didn't answer"
"5820380","5826240"," that you passed on the question was If Congress should be in charge of setting the federal rates"
"5826240","5834020"," fund, I can't think of a worse idea The only worse idea I think what might be another idea that"
"5834020","5841120"," was set forward earlier that Maybe we should be involved in supervising the banks Congress We can't"
"5841120","5843480"," even figure out appliances here for God's sakes."
"5843660","5847420"," We closed down the government over appliances We can't even figure that out."
"5847620","5852580"," I don't know how in the world we'd be setting rates and how in the world we'd be supervising banks"
"5854080","5859420"," Again, I think you guys can do a tighter job of supervising banks I mean, I do think that they're"
"5859420","5864660"," and you guys have admitted to that with the Silicon Valley bank And and I hope you do and I"
"5864660","5866000"," know you're looking at these regulations. "
"5866880","5875110"," It was brought up that That since 2008 2009 the capital requirements have gone up and the banks"
"5875110","5879990"," generally done well in this dress That what was the law that caused the rates the capital"
"5879990","5881250"," requirements to go up?"
"5881890","5888050"," It was a combination of Dodd-Frank and also the Basel Committee of course And those are the two"
"5888050","5891950"," things that if I've heard from colleagues on the other side They just keep beating up now."
"5892150","5897110"," They don't do it as much But when I first got here that was now there's the CFPB, but that"
"5897110","5903490"," was the that was the Choir again once again just saying it's the terrible bank But the reality is"
"5903490","5908710"," it probably saved banking in the United States and I appreciate it lastly I would just comment this"
"5908710","5909790"," and you don't have a comment."
"5909930","5915370"," I'm just gonna make this comment obviously Your focus in narrow is narrow and should be but the"
"5915370","5920050"," notion of climate change is important I do think that it's affecting the economy I do think that"
"5920050","5923650"," it's affecting our world and I do think that we've had our head in the sand for way too long"
"5923650","5925930"," on this issue And we have to do something about it. "
"5925990","5930310"," Obviously, that's not your mandate, but obviously it's important I hope we do something about it."
"5930510","5935030"," We don't have the courage to do that in Congress That's why I think others are doing it for us"
"5935030","5939750"," But we have to do something we see the bigger hurricanes We see these things happening and it's"

"7189820","7191560"," can provide that emergency assistance?"
"7192140","7197200"," Or do you pretty much have to be the the only line of defense against big internet runs?"
"7197200","7201340"," Well, I think regulation and supervision can play a role. "

"7235580","7240360"," Thank you So this here looks fairly good, right?"
"7240880","7248320"," Get a nice squeeze trade out of this Bam right squeezing it up But then in a 15 minute chart"

"7323380","7329340"," persistent than expected and I think we've come to expect that and expected to be more persistent"

"7523940","7529060"," of the 16 of the 18 participants on the FOMC wrote down that they they do believe it'll be"
"7529060","7534360"," appropriate to raise And a big majority believes raise rates twice this year, and I you know I"
"7534360","7539720"," think that's that's a pretty good Guess of what will happen if the economy performs about as"
"7539720","7546500"," expected Um, yeah, I think it's right more rate hikes likely or needed to bring inflation back down"
"7546500","7552540"," to the two percent and Um, you know, we're concerned about a hard landing about recession. "
"7552980","7559640"," So, uh, anyway My time has expired and I now recognize a gentleman from Illinois Mr. Caston for"
"7559640","7560340"," five minutes."
"7560780","7562080"," Thank you, madam chair."
"7562680","7567960"," Thank you chair pal for being here Um So in june of 2021. "
"7567980","7568540"," Sorry."
"7568640","7569760"," I just wanted to hear that really quick."
"7570000","7577980"," There is a little bit of a Jerome pal was saying that uh, this is not a pause And to"
"7577980","7586960"," expect two more rate hikes if the economy continues On its current track i.e. What he's telling you"
"7586960","7594200"," is that Uh, the economy is strong You know, you don't want to hear that but the economy is strong"
"7595120","7604220"," We're in a bit of a goldilocks Moment in the economy right now We have unemployment rising"
"7604220","7610360"," But job openings rising as well. "
"7610420","7619040"," So Now the demand for workers is still high even though the unemployment rate is creeping up The"
"7619040","7626000"," unemployment rate is not high right now Uh, but we have not had job destruction either, have we?"
"7627320","7632620"," So he's making us he was just making a statement there a few moments ago that uh due to that"
"7632620","7641740"," Uh, they will likely have to continue to raise rates two more times Uh this year Just to be aware"
"7641740","7647000"," of that that was just a statement from juroma a few moments ago Climate change does not pose a"
"7647000","7651200"," serious risk to the safety and soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the united"
"7651200","7655980"," states And went on to say that the risks posed by climate change are not sufficiently unique or"
"7655980","7662660"," material to merit special treatment relative to others Should we understand as we sit here that mr."
"7662920","7667380"," Waller was speaking in his personal capacity and not as a designee of the fed if indeed fed policy"
"7667380","7668960"," Hasn't changed since december 22."
"7669540","7677040"," Well, I I don't comment on what any of the things that my colleagues say So I I understand but"
"7677040","7682400"," you understand the concern that if if if markets and regulators are to understand that the fed has"
"7682400","7686800"," a consistent policy And one of the members of the fed is saying something that appears to be"
"7686800","7689640"," directly opposed to fed policy from six months earlier."
"7689860","7696800"," That's a concern Again, it's um People we you know, we governors have always had the ability and"
"7696800","7701900"," reserve bank presidents as well The ability to have their own views on things and and that's that's"
"7701900","7704560"," going to happen And that's probably a good thing that we have a diversity of perspectives. "
"7704660","7712560"," I think there may be Lessing that difference than you than you Suggest I mean again, I'm I'm what"
"7712560","7719240"," I'm saying is that Banks The extent we have a role it is to assure that banks understand and can"
"7719240","7722280"," manage the risks that they do face from from climate change."
"7722440","7729260"," Okay Well, I look I don't want to create internal tension, but I think we're all aware that Anyone"
"7729260","7733560"," is aware that your words are closely scrutinized and we were concerned with the words of your"
"7733560","7741400"," colleagues there You're not creating any internal He's not creating what's what's this castin guy"
"7741400","7741680"," saying?"
"7741940","7748840"," He's fucking crazy But it says among other things drums like they can have their own opinions."
"7749100","7755860"," I like that It casts like I don't want to create any diversion He's like you're not What the fuck"
"7755860","7764840"," he's saying Without opining on their mass If in fact we are looking at a world where climate a"
"7764840","7770640"," little quick little role here in this spooze on that on that statement from geroam just then a"
"7770640","7779000"," little bit of a role drama from the bears Tools to address this or we're going to say well that's"
"7779000","7784880"," bears will use anything right now, but just I love it They're like Bears will use anything they'll"
"7784880","7794720"," be like oh As far as a bear is concerned that"
"7794720","7803880"," was a rate hike we just got Doesn't enter my thinking in any way that we would Change our inflation"
"7804340","7807080"," Goal because of climate change or the need to deal with it. "
"7807440","7814220"," There's a lot of thinking and research that over a long period of time We need some kind of all"
"7814220","7819720"," any kind of all we'll do just say just say more rate hikes, please Drive inflation up, but that's"
"7819720","7826860"," not something we're thinking about Meetings we are not thinking about climate change as something"
"7826860","7829020"," that's relevant to the current inflation."
"7829020","7829540"," Yeah, dude."
"7829700","7831120"," It's almost three hours, right?"
"7831840","7836500"," Policy and that is very much our focus today is inflation today And I guess what I'm struggling"
"7836500","7840480"," with is that if we agree that this is a systemic risk if we agree Who is this casting guy?"
"7840660","7842620"," He's like drums like get fucked buddy. "
"7842840","7847480"," I give two fucks about climate change to care about inflation Aren't I here for inflation?"
"7848020","7849640"," He's like, what am I talking about here?"
"7849840","7854000"," One of the lessons that was noted in the Fed review Said that this is an opportunity for regulators"
"7854000","7858480"," and bank managers to be more willing to adopt a precautionary perspective and that the Fed must"
"7858480","7863400"," strengthen its supervision based on what we've learned I'm trying to figure out with climate change"
"7863400","7869100"," if we agree that this is a forward risk How do we get the Fed the tools to apply a"
"7869100","7870180"," precautionary perspective?"
"7870660","7875180"," The joman's time has expired the chairman can submit an answer in writing to the record And I now"
"7875180","7880060"," recognize myself for five minutes chairman pal and march you confirmed to me that the federal"
"7880060","7885780"," reserve is a consensus organization Built on garnering broad support before agreeing to any"
"7885780","7893760"," proposal And given the the breadth and scope of the potential changes to the capital framework That"
"7893760","7900740"," is under review right now that consensus driven approach seems to be all the more important I am"
"7900740","7901120"," concerned."
"7901480","7904640"," Oh, I see he's that's why he's asking about climate change."
"7904640","7912880"," He's asking because What is this he's involved in carbon nation a movie unilaterally And especially"
"7912880","7916980"," in light of section I see so he's motivated by climate change now I know why he's asking these"
"7916980","7922140"," questions, which is kind of scratching my head on this like why is this guy asking this stuff But"
"7922140","7924860"," I'm assuming that he's appealing to his base. "
"7925120","7929120"," That's what he's doing Can you speak to the process that's underway?"
"7930960","7933340"," Is the vice chairman acting?"
"7933680","7939020"," Yeah, you're trying to be a goblin on tv Can you walk through the steps?"
"7939720","7945380"," That the that the board will take he was he's probably appealing to his base He's got it."
"7945520","7946080"," It looks like that."
"7946320","7947720"," That's his uh political base. "
"7947920","7950100"," So I get it That's what you're doing."
"7950220","7954440"," I know they're gonna they're gonna grandstand for their for their voters I get it I don't know who"
"7954440","7958460"," I don't care who their voters are that everyone of them are gonna Be like yeah, you can quote me"
"7958460","7961920"," on what I said to Jerome As I mentioned before in another context."
"7962320","7968320"," He's not the comptroller of the currency He he brings proposals to the board and the board votes by"
"7968320","7974200"," majority vote to support them Or not and that's that's how that works in terms of his vision is he"
"7974200","7979820"," including other members of the board currently as he's So I think all of us have been getting"
"7979820","7984640"," briefings on what's developed But ultimately the job is to present something to the board for"
"7984640","7990760"," consideration by the board and how well seller is trying to roll the spoons down right now Debate"
"7990760","7998620"," deliberate see we were getting supplied down there There will be a Meeting it could be a virtual"

"8007800","8012780"," process now, but things are still moving around our concern Mr. Chairman is that it seems right"
"8012780","8018160"," right now the vice chairman is writing personalized assessments of bank failures and And and"
"8018160","8023120"," results of new fed climate scenario experiments with without a whole lot of collaboration with"

"8064040","8072140"," Well, given that's a pretty good decision And that the law requires the the full board to make this"
"8072140","8077760"," decision and not one board board member to act unilaterally Um, we would hope that the fed would"
"8077760","8084480"," hold public meetings on the new proposal We'll we'll you and the the federal reserve board commit"
"8084480","8090640"," also when when the Can we establish the requirements for a bear music today?"

"8581060","8581600"," point of this?"
"8581820","8589720"," So The only fail-safe way but uh Right now that I see to play any kind of music as"
"8589720","8599240"," if it's self-produced Someone gives you the rights to their music or um, you use the youtube"
"8601340","8607720"," In perpetuity Of free music and that's really that's a weird thing too because YouTube changed"
"8607720","8613900"," their policy recently Where you have to read the fine print Because they'll be like, YouTube's"
"8613900","8614220"," scummy."
"8614380","8616580"," They're like YouTube's like, you can use this one. "
"8616700","8622280"," It's free And then in the fine print they're like Oh, by the way, if we ever lose that license,"
"8622500","8625840"," we're gonna come back and take all that money from you I'm like, what are you fucking kidding me?"
"8626260","8635140"," So that's a very limited selection of what I can play without getting demonetized Uh The Cross "
"8635140","8643820","-channels Sometimes I do play music Then I do get copyright strikes, but they get things for the"
"8643820","8649000"," money And that's fine For the first half of this year."
"8649100","8653260"," I'm aware of it Follows kind of exponential growth that we've seen over the pound."
"8653260","8655840"," No, it just tagged it What's your assessment on it?"
"8655940","8658360"," So hyz just tagged my target reverse repo market. "
"8658580","8661900"," What's my target on hyz Not much."
"8662160","8667260"," It's just a place where that has holds money on the on the Fed's balance sheet It's like a mutual"
"8667260","8667640"," fund."
"8667700","8669580"," I mean, in fact, it's um, so right there. "
"8669720","8676500"," It's just tagged, right Issuing bills to refill the trades was my target 7440 was my target Uh, it"
"8676500","8683440"," slapped 7440 broke through and immediately was bought Isn't there some sort of conflict with higher"
"8683440","8683720"," reserve?"
"8683900","8689780"," What I'm looking for is a But I'm looking for is a actually my target should have been higher"
"8690440","8699620"," Target should have been 7441 Now you're looking for on that hyz you want to see us get under Trade"
"8699620","8704080"," under that 7441 and start to reject underneath it."
"8704240","8711120"," So we have an initial buy there at 7439 But immediately it was bought we want to see if we"
"8711120","8717680"," can get underneath that 7441 For more downside, you know the fact that the Fed needed to use an"
"8717680","8723120"," emergency for some good eyes out there watching hyz Normally indicate some and let's look at Tesla."
"8723120","8724160"," I keep saying we'll look at Tesla. "
"8724160","8728980"," I still haven't looked at Tesla There's no more cause everything's been settled What that was"
"8728980","8729240"," about?"
"8730260","8734720"," Suddenly finding ourselves in it in a in in reserves scarce if you have some time here look at"
"8734720","8740920"," Tesla now The level of reserves really carefully and and thinking that we knew where Scarcity would"
"8740920","8746460"," start to appear and it the problem is demand could be very volatile So demand spiked and there"
"8746460","8747040"," weren't enough reserves."
"8747400","8749540"," So you had a situation where we had to okay."
"8749760","8752940"," Let's look at Tesla here That's not what's going on with it. "
"8753100","8758420"," I mean we the reserve reversed Tesla starting to cool off a little bit It loves to trade its daily"
"8758420","8760220"," velocity Shrinking now."
"8760340","8765480"," We don't know how much it will shrink I think the dance is the first real like peak of daily"
"8765480","8766560"," velocity for it."
"8766680","8774440"," It's cranking right now Um, I'm going to expect to the cool down here Still in this range of"
"8774440","8780720"," consolidation We'll all that capital squeezed up here, right?"
"8781000","8785940"," Just change the color here Then it certainly has implications. "
"8786520","8788000"," Yeah, so move higher."
"8788260","8795020"," This is great right consolidation trade above the hourly Bam pushed higher Broke through the"
"8795020","8802160"," hourly, right We don't like trading Tesla on the hourly like traded on the daily and that's down"
"8802160","8802840"," here, right?"
"8803660","8809400"," This is where my box is to buy Tesla So if you had missed the Tesla run we talked about"
"8809400","8815720"," this box being your buy-in down here So still on track Tesla still believe it or not on trend"
"8815720","8823100"," right now Um You may not believe the Tesla's on trend, but it is If you stay focused on this"
"8823100","8826260"," yellow line right here Say yellow line."
"8826500","8831700"," I just delete everything so you can still make it more clear for you So as chairman of housing and"
"8831700","8835800"," insurance, I am continue to be so just this yellow line right here, right?"
"8836000","8840040"," This is the one that you're paying attention to the regular Tesla's like famous for running on this"
"8840040","8844420"," yellow line We called it right down here as we got the cross And bam we started moving higher"
"8844420","8849620"," ripping faces off target is still that three two ninety six above I'll put that box back up there"
"8849620","8855120"," for you It's like two ninety six or so Somewhere in there we got pretty fucking close to it though"
"8855120","8855700"," too, right?"
"8856500","8860980"," Um, so that would be a question for you right now would be we have another target above. "
"8861160","8864300"," It's like 350 ish Somewhere up in here."
"8864440","8865220"," I'll have to go back and check."
"8865420","8866240"," I'll get an exact for you. "
"8866260","8874120"," I deleted it Oh, but it's somewhere up in here So the question becomes here Uh two fold right let"
"8874120","8880880"," me show you another example of this So you can see in previously do you remember when we came up"
"8880880","8881160"," here?"
"8882660","8886700"," Yeah, that was the initial one right here Do you remember when we took this trade from a hundred"
"8886700","8886960"," bucks?"
"8887560","8890580"," I think I jumped on it at 120 or 135 or something."
"8891000","8895240"," I was like, yeah, I'm not chasing that and then I did I want I wanted to get 96 dollars."
"8895440","8899980"," I didn't get this like it's like the morning of this bought of this buy down below I was like,"
"8900100","8901560"," yeah, fuck that ain't buying that hundred. "
"8901700","8907540"," I know they're gonna dump it for dollars They didn't they just fucking ran for gone But you"
"8907540","8914160"," remember when we came above here I mean a price target I think of 220 And we like just missed"
"8914160","8919420"," it by a few few dollars four dollars or so or something like that So we had that initial trade"
"8919420","8919740"," here."
"8919860","8925100"," We talked about the consolidation that would take place And then we talked about when the move is"
"8925100","8930480"," ready that will take that trade Remember when I contacted a bunch of you via text and I said the"
"8930480","8936620"," trade is now on And we went all the way up right So we're kind of in that same spot,"
"8936820","8936920"," right?"
"8937180","8943040"," We know we're supposed to tag 296 and you can automatically see that the sellers were like fuck you"
"8943040","8948540"," We're not going there Surprise motherfucker like a kitty cat or something like cat jumps out and"
"8948540","8952900"," just like surprise You know people are gonna take profit up here."
"8953120","8954520"," We already talked about that too, right?"
"8954740","8962680"," Take money and run So the question becomes twofold Question becomes are we gonna hit the 300 are we"
"8962680","8969300"," still on track for 350 Right now the daily is a little a little over over bot right needs to"
"8969300","8975480"," cool off just a bit You also when you come off this daily trigger here, you always like to see"
"8975480","8982280"," the check You always like to see the check on the daily trigger I already showed you guys what a"
"8982280","8987620"," bull market looks like we'll go look at that right now But that first check down there is the big"
"8987620","8996220"," one If that check is Successful it usually leads to some major fucking moves to the upside Talked"
"8996220","9002120"," about about rocket lab on twitter So personally what I would like to see I know that you're not"

"9025800","9034720"," right there It's not a coincidence that So we're gonna make that yellow That's an ugly look that's"
"9034720","9041620"," an ugly ass looking uh Arrow apologize Just take a look at this here so you get something like that"
"9041620","9045780"," right And then you get price How did they were concerned for me?"

"9136480","9142640"," correction believe it or not four fucking 20 right now is a correction I said 400."
"9142640","9150220"," It's like four fucking 20 Like you need to fucking crash tomorrow dude like tomorrow To get your"
"9150220","9159020"," like rain blood down here Even attempt that 412 50 get it So those fucking goal posts are gonna"
"9159020","9160260"," just keep fucking coming. "

"9162900","9164980"," I'm gonna move those fucking goal posts."
"9165040","9174040"," They move those fucking goal posts so um Can we start crashing sure like um if you see something"
"9174040","9177440"," like I don't fucking know like that. "
"9177440","9183680"," I don't think I do know but See I get to be like See something like this happen with the"
"9183680","9189600"," orange and the orange starts to roll over You see the yellow over here start to roll over."
"9189840","9190500"," Oh god."
"9190680","9196580"," I can't believe we've been entertaining this for people um But they want to see it right they see"
"9196580","9201700"," the yellow roll over you see the fucking just price just destroyed I don't know why this would"
"9201700","9206360"," happen, but I guess you're looking for that there some kind of like Breathe higher than something"
"9206360","9210300"," like that breathe higher than you start seeing something like that Right kind of nonsense like that"
"9210300","9217420"," that you didn't get in that it's not getting somehow it happens so Point is this Here's the point. "
"9217540","9218440"," Here's the real point that matters."
"9218980","9224000"," So back in march Now we start to have this range here, right?"
"9225620","9231380"," Price yellow orange blue price yellow orange blue Price yellow orange blue whenever you see that"
"9231380","9237320"," price yellow orange blue Uh, I don't I don't like ever seeing the too much of an a rubber band"
"9237320","9242580"," here I don't want ever like seeing get too rubber bandy like too much stretch But when it comes"
"9242580","9252300"," back down it tends to continue higher Okay, a fair period of time Six months nine months Mostly"
"9252300","9261880"," year two three years not just six months like that's the fringe Right like the average is one two"
"9261880","9271880"," three years So Right now you got march we're in july In like month three"
"9271880","9277940"," or four Uh the probability of us crashing here is fucking slim can it happen?"
"9278220","9278320"," Fuck."
"9278480","9279180"," Yeah, it happens. "
"9279480","9284700"," We'll look at it Uh, but for right now, that's not what's showing itself and even historically Uh,"
"9285740","9290760"," the point that i'm going to make to you here though about tesla and where the spooze is Is that"
"9290760","9296180"," when we are in a bull market You are going to expect this is one right here Where are we?"
"9296880","9304080"," Blue orange yellow price And you see some really nice tags of that yellow right one two three four"
"9304080","9310540"," five six seven Great fucking places to buy the dip So tesla would be the same kind of a thing"
"9311360","9316420"," Every once in a while you'll see a bloodbath down here the orange for the orange but even then"
"9316960","9322720"," We're still in a bull market We're still in a fucking bull market."
"9322900","9326100"," So even if we break under What are you looking for here?"
"9326260","9331240"," You see that right the break under the daily and even that brings up the orange Even when we're"
"9331240","9339440"," doing that You did not see The yellow go crossing down below you did not see the orange start to"
"9339440","9344900"," cross below the blue diga You don't see that it continues higher still so you'll see yellow going"
"9344900","9347100"," higher as the price goes lower, right?"
"9349760","9355160"," So we'll show you an example when we actually do roll You can see it right here, right?"
"9355340","9360120"," We break below the orange the yellow starts to come down and starts to cross and then we start to"
"9360120","9366580"," see the actual crash Right so and we're not even talking about velocity going down before that"
"9366580","9372000"," happens We'll talk about that when the tool is released So for right now, we're not fucking seeing"
"9372000","9379720"," that are we so All of bull wants Is for a test down here?"
"9379840","9385200"," We just want to come on down here and do our next job be over there If somehow price breaks"
"9385200","9389880"," below the yellow line like this It starts to signal a down move."
