"80710","82090"," All right, good morning."
"83210","84710"," Check 1-2."
"86550","88190"," Check 1-2. "
"91810","92710"," Okay, let's see."
"93090","93610"," Let's take it in."
"93970","94650"," It's kind of weird morning. "
"95050","96170"," Some weird stuff."
"97650","98730"," Hey, I'll do it out there."
"98790","99090"," Good morning. "
"100550","101370"," Happy holidays."
"102810","109640"," I got my coffee this morning, so I'm gonna let us see who's here right now."
"114120","121420"," As it's the holidays, should we keep the Russian bot huckers and the pumpers out this morning, or"
"121420","122060"," should we leave them in?"
"122820","131580"," You know what, it did not put those words in there yesterday for certain people. "
"132000","134020"," I don't mind doing..."
"134640","137180"," I'm not like opposed to..."
"137180","139880"," I've tried a day I'm seeing the past."
"140840","142300"," It's like I'm not willing to do that."
"142400","144140"," It's just when the constant pumps come in. "
"144220","146380"," It's just kind of killing me here."
"147240","149000"," And I agree with Winky on that for sure."
"151400","152840"," I know we don't want to clog up the stream. "
"156740","158260"," I got a couple things here."
"158460","159580"," We got to enable some stuff."
"160140","161540"," You know, I was just thinking about Winky. "
"162300","165420"," I made a post on Twitter last night in the middle of the night."
"166400","168280"," So I got alert last night in the middle of the night."
"168320","172580"," I wake up and sure enough, market's selling off. "
"174220","176520"," We're having a market crash in the middle of the night."
"177420","182100"," And I wake up to short the market down."
"182100","191820"," And the first thing that clicked my mind was yesterday, Winky and I were like, I think I was like,"
"192080","198060"," I had some zero dates and then I grabbed some calls for today or something. "
"199300","201200"," No, is it today or the next day or something?"
"201600","205900"," And anyways, the market kept going up so I turned them in, took my money and ran."
"205900","211140"," And I think that Winky did the same thing yesterday."
"213680","214880"," So good morning. "
"216060","217120"," How are y'all doing today?"
"219680","222680"," So I think most of you closed them out yesterday."
"223900","227500"," And then, of course, I'm up last night at the middle of the night."
"228220","229660"," Oh, my God, I short this shit down. "
"230140","233120"," It was just an excuse to get to be honest with you."
"233120","239860"," We can talk about the end, but the truth is the market's just looking for any excuse."
"240760","243720"," To at least to try to get us down to the gap fill. "
"244160","247900"," So let's take anything and they ran with it last night."
"249140","258640"," And so I went, I traded it, traded a Globex last night and then I was like, you know"
"258640","263100"," what I'm done?"
"263100","265280"," I think it was 3973 or something."
"266100","268700"," There was a standing bid for like 250 contracts. "
"268880","270760"," So I'm like, this breaks right here."
"271000","275880"," I'll get back up and I'll I'll trade it down to like 3730 or something."
"277900","283380"," And I end up falling asleep, but right before I fell asleep, I posted something on Twitter. "
"283600","287460"," I'm like, you know, if this breaks, we're going down to 3730."
"287460","287980"," I'll be awake."
"288220","292080"," And of course, I never never got a text message alert or anything like that. "
"292080","295220"," So I slept right through like a baby woke up this morning."
"295480","296860"," I took a look at it and it never broke."
"297100","297840"," It just stayed there. "
"298880","304020"," So, you know, last night people were panicking on Twitter and they're like, you know, we can have a"
"304020","307320"," market meltdown over this, which is not not true."
"310520","311740"," It makes good."
"311840","316280"," It makes good panic, I guess, or sell sells the news, but no, we're not going to have a market"
"316280","318580"," meltdown with the end. "
"319440","322820"," Mostly because you want to see a rational markets."
"323840","327040"," Japan has Japan can have some rational markets."
"329140","337060"," Very famous U.S. ads funds have been torched trying to time Japanese markets historically, at"
"337060","337240"," least. "
"339280","343460"," And, you know, if it really was that bad last night, we would have had a market meltdown in the"
"343460","345180"," middle of the."
"346440","347840"," Hey, give me one second here."
"348460","350360"," I just want to grab some some coffee. "
"350600","351540"," Hold on one quick second here."
"351620","351780"," Okay."
"352280","353220"," You guys just joined us. "
"353280","354020"," Hold on one second here."
"358380","360820"," Want to make sure I got my stuff, my jams with me."
"388400","388900"," All right. "
"391680","393160"," So, of course, last night, I'm a."
"395520","405140"," You know, last night, I'm like."
"405580","405940"," Okay."
"406040","406360"," Check one. "
"406660","406980"," All right."
"407060","409760"," So last night, I'm a."
"410360","410960"," I got a better."
"411080","411420"," We got this one. "
"411520","412440"," I'm like, Oh, it didn't."
"412540","413580"," We never melt down the middle of it."
"413600","421080"," According to SCMP, China blocks EU's efforts to form WTO, Lithuania, export freeze and high tech"
"421080","421800"," patents. "
"422820","423660"," It's just an excuse."
"424020","426120"," We need the excuse to dump the market, right?"
"426300","426840"," You're not going to be."
"427020","435120"," You're not going to be a."
"435120","435520"," They're like. "
"436260","438220"," They're like, I wish I caught."
"438500","441020"," They're like, I wish I caught the down move yesterday."
"443300","445400"," Here, but you know, and I was short. "
"446020","446420"," Esto."
"446980","449520"," Not sure, but you know, long triple leverage."
"450660","451860"," Calls on esto. "
"452920","453320"," Inversity."
"453680","454440"," But the same thing."
"454560","456160"," It's like how much of the trade do you need. "
"456900","458680"," It's very similar to when you buy a bomb."
"460560","463880"," So you're just left sitting around not doing all of a lot."
"463880","464800"," You're like day trade it. "
"465500","467540"," But the majority of the move is typically done."
"468360","470320"," It doesn't matter if it goes up or down."
"471460","473300"," You know, another fucking two or three hundred points. "
"473520","473800"," You're there."
"474600","476400"," The name of the game in this market."
"476760","477380"," Any market. "
"477760","482720"," The name of the game is to wealth preservation and consistent trades."
"483200","490260"," So, you know, you wind up sitting on the sidelines a lot of the time waiting for the next turn."
"490260","494600"," Now, at this point, we should have had some kind of a relief rally. "
"495720","497400"," Here, we're coming in the market open right now."
"497860","499980"," I want to see if we're going to, matter of fact, hold on one second."
"506840","508560"," We want to open up the old brokerage here. "
"513220","515860"," If we start blasting off the open, I don't want to miss it."
"516100","533890"," So, the,"
"534130","536350"," we got our levels up here."
"536450","537850"," We got this gap down below here. "
"538490","541490"," I think it's 375, 11 or something."
"542770","545150"," And then we've got one more gap down below here."
"545150","546710"," It's like 370, 371. "
"547710","551790"," We're so close that it's, we're so close."
"552030","554450"," And also the range is tightening up a little bit today."
"554730","558570"," I don't know if I want to, I want to tell you guys that, that the bottom range is starting"
"558570","559070"," to tighten. "
"563530","567170"," We're already trading above the, the EMA we've got here."
"571040","572960"," So, we have another thing going on too."
"573200","575060"," We've got way too many puts in the market. "
"575400","576160"," Way, way, way, way."
"576160","578700"," We'll look at the put call ratio, but it's just climbing every day."
"578900","579940"," Just going up and up and up. "
"580560","584820"," And when the, regardless of what you think of the put call ratio, some people say it doesn't work."
"585040","590820"," But when it gets too high, when it just gets crazy with puts, at some point we end up having"
"590820","594120"," to, we usually got to turn at some point with put call ratio."
"594420","598780"," So, if we can get down here at all today, it's any way to get down here today. "
"600060","605920"," You can see we've got a S1 at 377, 375 on S2."
"606060","607420"," These are really tight ranges here."
"607420","611260"," And then this, this way out of bounds down below here. "
"611840","615300"," The pivot is at 380.70 today."
"615560","618760"," There's a little bit of a change in the, in the gamma models today."
"623890","633110"," Where the negative gamma models have us, have us at a break of 3800 on"
"633110","635430"," SPX. "
"636510","638530"," Would send us into a downward spiral."
"638530","643570"," That's basically, hold on, let me mute this for real quick."
"644410","646250"," Just so you guys can have some awareness. "
"647530","649630"," So, basically we're right about here."
"651950","653450"," Not right about right here."
"654750","656510"," Is some real negative. "
"656750","660310"," Negative after rising over $1 a barrel earlier in the session."
"661630","663390"," So, I'll leave that up for today."
"664310","666950"," So, you can see my cursor is really negative gamma right here. "
"668090","669830"," Above, of course, is zero gamma."
"671250","674810"," And that is right where the pivot line is."
"675030","681270"," And then 3840, R1. "
"681650","682210"," Same thing as usual."
"682450","683530"," This is positive gamma."
"683790","688370"," I can write this in for you so you can see if things get positive or not. "
"691630","693470"," But that's, you know, like we're just getting stretched."
"696770","704340"," So, there's a, you can only stretch for so long."
"705380","707420"," Because I guess the point I'm trying to make for you. "
"715180","715860"," Excuse me."
"717260","723140"," Okay, so zero gamma positive gamma and negative gamma is right here."
"723900","736980"," And we can"
"736980","744100"," look at some, some examples of a slight upwards day, then a couple down days and then a swing high. "
"744980","746540"," If that's what happens."
"747220","748360"," That's my anticipation for today."
"748380","753080"," If you're any wondering, I'm expecting some kind of a positive day this morning. "
"753880","759840"," If you want to know my, my, my viewpoint is that we have a positive day here."
"761880","763300"," How positive is it?"
"763300","771780"," I'd, I'd really like to see us trade up at least two R1, maybe trade sideways and down for the"
"771780","774460"," next two days and then have a swing high."
"775960","777460"," That's, that's, I prefer to see. "
"777760","787580"," We could look at it on a, at some point this morning, we'll look at closing the gap above and"
"787580","790660"," then two legs down into the weekly moving average."
"791520","793300"," We're getting so close to it too."
"794020","802600"," You're like, as, as you start trading down here, it, it's a, you've got computer programs, the"
"802600","804320"," enemy program to buy a bottom. "
"805160","806580"," Another couple hundred points down."
"806940","808860"," So like how much deeper can you go?"
"809340","813520"," I know there's bears out that it'll say we'll break through that, but the market just doesn't"
"813520","814680"," structure for that to happen."
"816120","821900"," If we saw real money selling, it could happen, but we would see it in the, in the order flow"
"821900","822360"," in the dome. "
"822360","824420"," We'd, we'd know that it was happening before it happened."
"826440","828420"," So the likely move is up at this point."
"830340","832440"," Yeah, so let's talk about TLT. "
"833260","834420"," We'll take a look at TLT."
"834820","836360"," I noticed that this morning as well."
"836480","837140"," That was good to see. "
"838460","839180"," Hold on here."
"841420","845760"," The fair point, I didn't think to bring that up originally this morning, but we'll look at TLT."
"846780","848620"," I've been talking about TLT, right?"
"848760","849360"," It was really weird. "
"849900","857100"," On Twitter yesterday, someone said, or last night said, all the TLT market bulls are caught short"
"857100","859920"," or something or caught in TLT."
"859980","864580"," And I was like, I don't know anyone that's long TLT."
"867960","871660"," We hit this almost to the fucking pen, which was crazy. "
"872120","875020"," And this is literally, you know, horse shoes and hand grenades."
"876020","878280"," It's pretty much a fucking pen strike up here."
"879800","882360"," And I told you what I was looking for down here. "
"882520","884360"," We talk about this, it's all on the tape, right?"
"884520","885700"," We'd make these every single day."
"886580","889040"," And we say, what are we looking for down here?"
"889380","890060"," And here it is, right?"
"890200","891480"," We're looking for TLT."
"892260","895900"," I don't know if there's a trade in here to trade back up. "
"896220","900760"," I'd like to see something down like this, or if this continues down today."
"902380","908700"," But I'm really looking to buy TLT, like 102-ish, 1250-100."
"909220","916000"," The cooler part about TLT is, or a couple of things you need to know about TLT is, you know,"
"916120","918080"," this trade lasts for fucking a month. "
"919200","922380"," So you want to make sure that you're getting in on the right side of the trade."
"922940","925060"," You don't want to be buying TLT up here, right?"
"925840","931720"," You want to see TLT, consolidate a little bit, and then pick a trend."
"931900","934020"," You can finance ministry, say the bottom of that trend. "
"934920","940700"," If you miss the phone on TLT, let's say TLT gets a bounce today."
"941860","944240"," And it begins a new leg up or something."
"944720","949840"," You know, it's okay to let it trade up and then come back down and grab one of these dips. "
"950420","955060"," One of the keys about trading TLT is going to definitely be patience."
"955260","956600"," Oil is the same way, right?"
"957180","958320"," You'll jump into an oil trade."
"959060","964560"," You'll see that you'll jump into, like, oil and you'll see it's in the shitter. "
"965460","967080"," And then it blasts up in the overnight."
"967620","969100"," And then, you know, by morning, it's low again."
"969100","974980"," So patience always with TLT in the trade. "
"976880","980960"," Always like to see it start to form some kind of a sideways consolidation."
"981900","983420"," A bottom before you jump in."
"983560","986060"," You don't have to be in the fucking TLT trade. "
"987120","988240"," Click down here."
"988760","990120"," You don't have to catch the exact trade."
"990300","992240"," You just have to watch the trade. "
"992560","993220"," Watch it."
"993340","993760"," Watch it."
"993760","995080"," Grab a dip. "
"996120","997380"," And then start trading it up."
"997560","997680"," Okay."
"998500","1000440"," Do not get caught on the top. "
"1000900","1003780"," The UK finance ministry says the levy will be applied."
"1004100","1005280"," Timing is key on these trades."
"1005480","1010500"," These trades don't pay unless you have the revenue from selling periodic output at an average price"
"1010500","1013320"," above 75 pounds per megawatt hours. "
"1013480","1020520"," If you didn't want to trade this with options, then I would highly recommend buying the underlying"
"1020520","1022580"," and, you know, sell puts off the underlying."
"1022580","1024940"," If you can grab a hundred pack or whatever."
"1027140","1028680"," But I still think it has more time. "
"1028819","1034819"," I think it needs a little bit of consolidation or at least a directional bias so that you can find"
"1034819","1035640"," a bottom to buy."
"1036780","1040720"," If you unless you want to, you know, the other thing you could do if you don't really care about"
"1040720","1041540"," where we are down here."
"1042099","1047300"," Another cool thing would be to maybe buy something that's much farther out. "
"1047300","1049040"," Just I saw."
"1049320","1050880"," I went through the options channel."
"1051060","1051880"," T l t the other day. "
"1052020","1052800"," There are some."
"1054020","1056820"," High concentrations of calls on T l t."
"1057540","1061500"," Deep into late 2023 and early 2024, I believe."
"1063440","1065500"," I think there's some one 50s. "
"1065800","1067640"," I think one 50 is a kind of a key strike."
"1068360","1072680"," So if you're looking for something that's a that's a year out, you don't really have to care about."
"1073320","1075880"," You know, the bloodbath down here. "
"1076060","1078520"," It's not going to mean shit three months from now."
"1079980","1081300"," You have to worry about all that."
"1081600","1083900"," And it'll end up printing into next year. "
"1087650","1090050"," I also wouldn't be afraid of a market crash with T l t."
"1090490","1093350"," T l t will hold itself right through a market crash."
"1093970","1094350"," That's another one."
"1094450","1099030"," That's another head scratcher for me is I saw some bears talking about how T l t would be a."
"1099730","1101490"," Like it would go down with the rest of the market. "
"1101510","1102610"," That's just not true."
"1102610","1108750"," So if you start to see the market actually go up with any meaningfulness, you'd probably be"
"1108750","1109830"," sideways with T l t."
"1109910","1116670"," You could cut it loose and just start putting money into speculative stocks and indexes."
"1117650","1121030"," It's hard to trade to go wrong on right now. "
"1121850","1125610"," With the expectations in the market with the decoupling of the dollar."
"1126730","1130230"," You're going to see, you know, the expectation is rates are coming down."
"1130230","1134490"," The Fed is going to stop raising rates or pause or whatever. "
"1135470","1136790"," That's another thing I read last night."
"1136950","1140110"," Twitter, man, people on Twitter are like, don't fight the Fed."
"1140270","1142190"," And I'm like, you know, I don't fight the fucking Fed. "
"1142350","1146210"," But at the same time, I trust the bond market the most."
"1146470","1148530"," I trust the bond market more than I trust the Fed."
"1149490","1152670"," The bond market is pretty spot on. "
"1153350","1157010"," You know, the market is full of probably the smartest financial minds in our country."
"1157830","1159350"," These aren't the Lambo drivers."
"1160010","1165930"," These aren't the flash people that go spend two, three years working at GS and then go work at some"
"1165930","1166810"," small firms somewhere. "
"1167030","1169750"," These are guys that are grinders on data."
"1171870","1172550"," They're smart."
"1173310","1174730"," They're smarter than anybody in the market. "
"1174890","1175170"," Well, not anybody."
"1175410","1181250"," Most people in the stock market are not technically inclined as the bond market."
"1181450","1182990"," So the bond market's saying this is what's going to happen. "
"1184450","1186730"," Regards with the Fed saying I trust the bond market."
"1189410","1190210"," Oh, hold on here."
"1200380","1201440"," Oh, yeah, no worries, Joe. "
"1201740","1203160"," If you're out there listening right now, Joe, no worries."
"1205540","1208620"," Okay, so maybe I'll take a break here and I'll call Joe."
"1208780","1210020"," I got some stuff I got to talk to him about. "
"1211560","1212500"," No worries, brother."
"1213160","1215240"," If you're out there listening right now, Joe, no worries at all."
"1215240","1221580"," Yeah, I would even if there's a bid in TLT, it's fine to wait for a trend, man. "
"1222000","1222700"," It's this way."
"1222900","1226060"," If it's this way, it has more down to go."
"1229220","1230920"," TLT trade is a definite. "
"1232640","1234580"," A definite take your time trade."
"1235400","1236680"," Just relax, let it do its thing."
"1243580","1247220"," Another trade that's like that is Dow Jones industrial average. "
"1247840","1251560"," It just takes the trade as, you know, put it a separate account."
"1251840","1252380"," Don't look at it."
"1267220","1268600"," Yeah, I don't think it's the individual intelligence. "
"1269340","1271020"," I wouldn't say it's just the individual intelligence."
"1271960","1274580"," I think that they, I think that they look at the data."
"1276680","1280660"," Hard enough that or long enough and hard enough that they know what they usually. "
"1281060","1282500"," They're usually not wrong."
"1282500","1287040"," And what they're projecting to happen in the stock market."
"1287200","1288420"," I should say I should rephrase that. "
"1291650","1293690"," They're, they're usually ahead of the curve."
"1294150","1298810"," Not always, but usually ahead of the curve on predicting what happens."
"1299190","1300930"," What, what impacts the stock market?"
"1308130","1309310"," Volatility is ridiculous. "
"1311170","1312770"," They've got a previous low here."
"1313670","1318890"," Also, this is negative gamma here and this is also the previous low from yesterday right here."
"1318890","1319970"," We clean that up. "
"1324780","1326040"," We bought some calls, baby."
"1342050","1347290"," Have some lower lows below if you look on the gamma or the, or the book map profile."
"1361520","1363120"," Is Joe in here at all or no?"
"1363600","1364460"," See what you guys are saying. "
"1365780","1366140"," Okay."
"1366320","1367200"," Let me just roll through."
"1367240","1368300"," See what you guys are saying this morning. "
"1369060","1369680"," Good morning, John."
"1369800","1371000"," Good morning to COVID."
"1371220","1371880"," Good morning, Binky. "
"1372100","1372320"," How are you?"
"1375300","1375960"," Kid time."
"1376060","1376360"," Good morning."
"1378060","1379880"," Did he say Japan hate Santa?"
"1380860","1382180"," This book map has me confused. "
"1383540","1384140"," Tony cheese."
"1384360","1384620"," Good morning."
"1384680","1385160"," How are you brother?"
"1386080","1386700"," Good morning, Matt. "
"1386840","1387080"," How are you?"
"1389340","1390200"," Good morning, Lawrence."
"1390400","1390840"," Good morning, Johnny."
"1391080","1391480"," Mooges. "
"1391640","1391960"," Good morning."
"1393120","1393140"," Chase."
"1393480","1393840"," What's up, brother?"
"1394780","1395860"," Good morning, Winky face. "
"1396280","1400020"," Jim Kramer explaining Larry Williams thinks there will still be a Santa rally."
"1400620","1401580"," Ooh, I didn't see that yet."
"1402640","1403720"," I'll have to watch that, Winky. "
"1404300","1405500"," I'll put some time aside."
"1407420","1412740"," My kid, my family, my friends, family and children are asking a lot of me right now too."
"1413440","1417140"," So I haven't done a lot of like watching videos and stuff. "
"1419100","1423680"," My daughter last night had me spend time with her for a couple hours."
"1425120","1426880"," They're like sponges when you give them time."
"1428240","1428660"," Good morning, Victor. "
"1428880","1429160"," How are you?"
"1431020","1431840"," Band of bots."
"1432900","1433380"," I think I did that."
"1433800","1434440"," Good morning, Dean. "
"1434660","1435020"," Good morning, Gil."
"1435540","1436180"," Good morning, Guru."
"1436460","1436680"," I'm a trader. "
"1436920","1437120"," How are you?"
"1437580","1438200"," Good morning, Brian."
"1439200","1440000"," Good morning, Ross."
"1440180","1440600"," Good morning, Garrett. "
"1441000","1442040"," Good morning, old guy, gamer."
"1443520","1444940"," I'm playing chicken up to the bell."
"1445680","1446060"," Free charge. "
"1446280","1447420"," It's just 3700 area."
"1447940","1448360"," Winky face."
"1448560","1449780"," I still think we get the Santa rally. "
"1450000","1451320"," Larry thinks I get the Santa rally."
"1451500","1451880"," Probably wrong."
"1452200","1452240"," LOL. "
"1452900","1453640"," Yeah, no, I don't."
"1454240","1455760"," You know, it's a weird place in the market."
"1455940","1456460"," You can't really. "
"1457740","1459120"," It's not a place that you want a short."
"1459360","1461160"," It's not a place that you want to be long."
"1461620","1462400"," It's kind of a weird spot. "
"1462400","1464360"," You want to see the gap closed below."
"1465880","1468300"," With some kind of conviction to take a retracement trade."
"1470320","1471300"," Good morning, Tony. "
"1471500","1471960"," How are you?"
"1473860","1474900"," I agree with that, Chase."
"1475540","1477240"," It's not the best place to shortening."
"1477980","1483740"," I was saying on Twitter this morning, I was like, you can take a straddle or a strangle and you'll"
"1483740","1484160"," get paid. "
"1485140","1487580"," But to be like one sided, you just can't."
"1487740","1488880"," It's not worth it."
"1489740","1490980"," It's not worth losing your money. "
"1493440","1496560"," You guys all see the video cramposts, the stuff from Larry Oames."
"1496720","1497320"," Nope, didn't see it."
"1498260","1502220"," Maybe the tin foil, but I think they hit that low overnight to avoid playing all the puts in cash"
"1502220","1502680"," market. "
"1503640","1504580"," Like they had an up."
"1504800","1506080"," I hope that they load more puts today."
"1506220","1507620"," Like we need, we need puts on market. "
"1508280","1513000"," And if we can get the put call ratio of like one six, one eight, one point eight, one point"
"1513000","1513840"," six, something like that."
"1514580","1516000"," Anything really crank and high."
"1516600","1517640"," We should get a rally out of it. "
"1521680","1525180"," Yeah, 37.30 on futures last night."
"1525460","1530100"," If we had broken through, I think it was 39.70. Something like that."
"1530240","1531000"," We would have had it straight. "
"1531280","1532960"," We would have started getting torched."
"1533660","1534960"," No, 37.9 or something."
"1535420","1539420"," 37.9 or something would have sent us to 37.30. I remember exactly what the numbers are. "
"1542940","1543700"," Good morning, everybody."
"1543920","1546400"," Good morning, legend, legend, two X to two X."
"1549160","1551280"," Winkies like I'm buying it right now and TLT."
"1552020","1552420"," Yeah. "
"1552560","1553640"," I mean, you can buy the underlying here."
"1553680","1554160"," It means nothing."
"1555040","1556560"," A couple dollars up and down. "
"1556680","1557500"," It doesn't mean shit."
"1558080","1559760"," Dollar, dollar two, dollar five."
"1560840","1562960"," It's not a bad place to be owned in TLT. "
"1566490","1569070"," No bounce until I'd even hit 167 area."
"1569250","1569990"," Thanks for the heads up, Chase."
"1571010","1572470"," T plus two today. "
"1573490","1575050"," Actual Dan is saying more than actual Dan."
"1577930","1578830"," Right on Gary."
"1580770","1581550"," Wink face. "
"1581930","1582210"," Two dollars."
"1582590","1583710"," Cap opened down pretty hard."
"1583870","1585250"," Oh, TLT opened down pretty hard. "
"1586150","1586710"," Right on Wink."
"1588170","1590790"," Bricked Apple's getting smoked off the bell."
"1591770","1594090"," Yeah, we should look at Apple right now. "
"1594510","1597770"," Started buying 105 C for January expiry today, but I only bought a couple."
"1599310","1600450"," Good morning, Jasmine."
"1600550","1600810"," How are you?"
"1601530","1602710"," NK getting close to 100. "
"1602710","1604750"," I'm going to get some post discord link."
"1604950","1607470"," I think when you did that, I've been doing puts on TLT since Friday."
"1607470","1608510"," Good job, derivative yield. "
"1609250","1611410"," Put back like bullish with lots of green then dumped."
"1613390","1614450"," Yeah, this looks like a rule."
"1614830","1618570"," Normally you don't see such a wide orange band. "
"1619330","1621790"," This looks like I'm going to expect."
"1622590","1623790"," I can put this out there."
"1624710","1631070"," I'm going to expect that you see the hero indicator saying that puts are being sold for calls. "
"1631070","1631850"," I had to guess."
"1634570","1635770"," I agree with that legal honesty."
"1637050","1637950"," What else you got there?"
"1640110","1641030"," Good morning, real hit. "
"1641150","1641410"," How are you?"
"1641730","1643010"," Make five, four, seven, eight."
"1643130","1643390"," Good morning."
"1643870","1644850"," Event is good morning, brother. "
"1645910","1646670"," Patrick, good morning."
"1647050","1647650"," Dehost, good morning."
"1648350","1649310"," Coop, black, good morning. "
"1650370","1650910"," Harm, good morning."
"1651090","1651630"," Everything, good morning."
"1651910","1652670"," Decrosy, good morning. "
"1655510","1658650"," The story is that he thinks we could have until Thursday and then it's turn around."
"1658650","1660630"," Yeah, let's look at a real quick."
"1660830","1661630"," Let's just look at something. "
"1662050","1663830"," So let's say you have an update today, believe it or not."
"1663950","1664810"," I know it doesn't look like it."
"1664870","1665350"," It looks like doom. "
"1666190","1666950"," But over here."
"1668670","1669530"," Over here, right?"
"1669750","1670690"," This looks more like."
"1671270","1672330"," This looks more like. "
"1673670","1674630"," Honestly, I just look like."
"1674750","1675750"," Ten a.m. Eastern time."
"1675990","1677470"," We get your own consumer concert. "
"1677470","1680350"," So we're going to last four cast minus twenty two."
"1680350","1685510"," We're going to look at a minus twenty three spot nine with a range of minus twenty to minus twenty"
"1685510","1686030"," six."
"1687630","1690070"," You can kind of see it play out. "
"1694470","1696010"," Previously, something like this."
"1700220","1702180"," The pattern typically is something like this."
"1702540","1702900"," You have a low. "
"1704820","1709560"," You have a good day trade up and then a couple down days and then you get this nice move"
"1709560","1709860"," higher."
"1710460","1712660"," It's something like we do something like it's the repetitive patterns."
"1713400","1715860"," Kind of looking for something like this on a larger scale. "
"1715860","1719140"," And so you're kind of thinking."
"1722540","1724640"," You're going to find a low somewhere down in here."
"1726240","1728120"," I don't know if it's today or whatever. "
"1728360","1733400"," You know, you trade up down for a couple days and then when we talk over a couple weeks, do"
"1733400","1735400"," we talk about like a Friday or a Monday?"
"1735860","1738960"," I don't know if it's on a Friday or it's on a Monday, but you end up having that swing"
"1738960","1739300"," high."
"1740140","1740840"," So like a good day."
"1741540","1743580"," And then you come back down to grab support. "
"1744080","1747560"," One, two, and you get to push your push higher."
"1749420","1750840"," Just in a longer time frame."
"1751020","1754120"," This is on like a week four or five trade session time frame. "
"1754700","1756220"," You're looking for support."
"1756640","1756900"," Come in."
"1757540","1760280"," You're looking for buyers to first step in. "
"1762380","1764280"," You'll have an initial pull up."
"1764280","1767360"," You'll have some FOMO buyers come in and roll back over."
"1768280","1771940"," And then you end up making forcing people to rebuy this one more time. "
"1771940","1775300"," Just to create more bag holders, believe it or not."
"1775660","1777760"," And then you get that one, that one pickup."
"1778100","1779900"," So that's what I'm hoping for. "
"1781480","1783760"," We know where the gaps are."
"1785920","1787480"," There's 390 up here."
"1788280","1790140"," And then we have this big one down here. "
"1790280","1791200"," This is 356."
"1792100","1793380"," Look on a daily chart here."
"1797610","1799410"," We have a couple gaps here. "
"1799750","1800590"," We've got a gap."
"1801030","1801410"," Let me see."
"1805390","1806610"," Push up, push up. "
"1806810","1807910"," We've got a little bit of a gap right here."
"1807970","1809070"," That's these two yellow bars."
"1809730","1810730"," This is a gap, right?"
"1812010","1814890"," We've got a little bit of a gap in here where these two yellow bars are. "
"1815250","1816430"," And a little bit more gap right here."
"1817830","1818730"," These 373s, right?"
"1819090","1825510"," So you've got this gap down below here."
"1826950","1828250"," It's going to leave a yellow for now. "
"1829190","1830290"," You've got another gap down below."
"1830430","1831130"," This is S3."
"1833370","1835010"," And you've got this gap on high. "
"1835010","1839390"," And we've already started closing the gap here."
"1840170","1841710"," So this gap's been closed, right?"
"1842530","1843970"," So we closed this gap right here."
"1844010","1844750"," Basically, it's closed. "
"1846410","1848510"," So we came down."
"1848770","1850290"," So if we came down here, right?"
"1851090","1851790"," Came down here."
"1852250","1853470"," Closed this gap, right?"
"1853790","1854690"," Gap is gone. "
"1856670","1857190"," Right?"
"1857490","1861090"," So the logic is that you're going to want to close the gap above, right?"
"1861830","1862750"," So this goes away."
"1864210","1868530"," And then you'd somehow come down or it's going to bounce, of course."
"1869590","1870710"," Maybe it can make this better. "
"1871370","1872670"," So you come down here, close the gap, right?"
"1875170","1878510"," Need some strength to get up there and close this gap, right?"
"1880190","1881390"," This gap goes, bye-bye."
"1882590","1884790"," You start bloodbath it down, doom and gloom."
"1885310","1887130"," You're going to tell you we're going to 400 or something. "
"1887990","1889030"," You're not going to reach 400."
"1890170","1891830"," We're going to smash this gap out."
"1892330","1899150"," And we're going to start really hammering down and making that attempt for the 200-day weekly"
"1899150","1900830"," moving average, which is over here. "
"1901890","1906090"," That would be my something like this is what I'd like to see."
"1907550","1908410"," Something like this."
"1909630","1912430"," Now, on the flip side, this is the Dan Niles kind of thing. "
"1912790","1914390"," If you say, nope, cap, we're not doing that."
"1914510","1918190"," We're just going to start blasting, making an attempt and fail and come down here."
"1918310","1919390"," Something like this. "
"1920250","1925410"," I'm fine with this, too, because the faster we get down here, right, there's the faster that"
"1925410","1929090"," instead of shorting the market, I can long the market."
"1929310","1935350"," So the sooner you can get down here, the easier it is to take this next trade up in relative"
"1935350","1935950"," safety."
"1938750","1942430"," And I think that this negates a crash coming up. "
"1942610","1948690"," If we go straight down right here, I'm going to expect a fucking huge."
"1948690","1952730"," Huge move off this weekly moving average."
"1952810","1953690"," And I'll show you where that is. "
"1956770","1957490"," I'll pick it."
"1957630","1959750"," I'll pick and show you the weekly moving average here."
"1967360","1974020"," At 10 a.m. Eastern time, we get Eurozone consumer confidence flash forecast minus 22 on the prior"
"1974020","1975720"," of minus 23 spot nine. "
"1975980","1977240"," Well, this is a range of minus 20."
"1977240","1979640"," A little bit low, but you can see it's down here, 356."
"1980380","1981580"," So you see that line right there?"
"1981580","1983240"," That's right down in here. "
"1983520","1985580"," I don't know."
"1985780","1989080"," If they try to do this over Christmas, they try to do this over New Year's."
"1990280","1992560"," Maybe they can crash the market, you know. "
"1993360","2000440"," But I'll tell you what, man, this is like, start slipping underneath this weekly moving average"
"2000440","2000940"," down here."
"2002580","2004680"," And we got a whole lot of light coming our way."
"2015840","2017680"," Yeah, I'm going to probably buy this right here. "
"2018500","2019700"," Let me just second here."
"2031100","2032820"," Where do I think this is going?"
"2035420","2036600"," What's our one?"
"2038960","2040260"," 384, maybe?"
"2041820","2052179"," We'll let this cool"
"2052179","2052920"," off a little bit."
"2057420","2060040"," Now above the 888 EMA. "
"2070920","2073400"," Can we look at the overnight lows on book map?"
"2074540","2075679"," I closed it out."
"2075960","2077820"," I turned it off the overnight lows."
"2078560","2081080"," But if you want to look at it, I can probably load it up for you. "
"2090520","2091800"," Big swing back up in India."
"2092179","2093080"," Yeah, it's selling exhaustion."
"2093659","2095340"," We're exhausted and selling 100%. "
"2103530","2105330"," Just blasting higher now."
"2123220","2124340"," Smashing and bashing."
"2126360","2127680"," I'm in some calls. "
"2130500","2131660"," I'm in some."
"2132640","2134740"," I got some 384s."
"2135340","2136860"," I got some 38 ones. "
"2140560","2143440"," I got some 38 ones for right about here."
"2143700","2145680"," And if I can get some, we got a gap to fill above here."
"2146000","2147180"," You got to see this gap by the pivot. "
"2148380","2149620"," A little bit of a gap here."
"2152120","2153440"," You can see it right there."
"2173380","2176960"," Our one is also a previous high from yesterday into the bell. "
"2177120","2177980"," I don't know what isn't."
"2178300","2182020"," Let me put some small places to just."
"2183540","2185600"," This is a previous high from yesterday. "
"2187040","2188520"," Right before we got into the bell."
"2189240","2191860"," This is where the sellers were yesterday."
"2192980","2194300"," So that gap is. "
"2197300","2198800"," So just some points of interest."
"2201200","2203360"," I don't know if you guys can see those or not."
"2204660","2205780"," I guess we'll see those. "
"2206860","2207720"," One minute remaining."
"2217360","2218760"," Yeah, I think we're in trend demand."
"2219060","2219920"," I think today is an update. "
"2220260","2220940"," We go to our one."
"2222920","2225820"," You can see that it looked like we're selling calls down below, right?"
"2246830","2248790"," Hopefully just keep blasting up there today."
"2252210","2252690"," Chase. "
"2254930","2256550"," Just be cool up here."
"2256690","2260050"," We got we got a little bit of a previous I read close yesterday."
"2261170","2264350"," So you're going to be looking for you guys ready to trade today. "
"2267510","2270870"," It's right here at 3.42. Got a gap above."
"2270870","2273630"," This is a credit point right here."
"2274970","2278950"," It would be nice to see us trade break through this and kind of. "
"2279590","2280710"," You know, do this fight."
"2281530","2283190"," Or maybe it's better to do so."
"2283610","2285490"," Last step right here. "
"2285630","2288110"," Do this fight right here and then make a next leg up."
"2288510","2291630"," To this fight right here and then fail that one right there."
"2291790","2292510"," If I had to guess. "
"2293110","2295170"," So one, the two, the three pumps."
"2296130","2297230"," That's what I'm looking for."
"2297950","2299670"," Looks like some kind of a failure up here. "
"2303930","2306270"," Are there mapples doing for you out there right now?"
"2306370","2306690"," Pretty good."
"2318030","2320930"," Keep on minus 22 minus 22."
"2321470","2324010"," Lower than forecast minus 22. "
"2324410","2325210"," Don't stop now."
"2325790","2326590"," Keep on pumping."
"2327250","2329410"," Keep on pushing through. "
"2330190","2331510"," Baby, do it for me."
"2333410","2335530"," Slap that ask up there and close that gap."
"2337170","2337970"," Slap that point. "
"2339650","2340590"," Close the gap."
"2341230","2342070"," We just close the gap."
"2342070","2343550"," You might want to take some off right around here. "
"2344270","2346050"," Let it it can bounce over a little bit."
"2346070","2348210"," But you want to you want to just want to take take some off."
"2348770","2350410"," It's okay to take some off up here. "
"2351370","2353830"," And let it start to consolidate at some point."
"2355170","2358230"," Jump back in, consolidate, jump back in, consolidate."
"2359750","2364770"," If it starts to roll over at some point, then you don't have to worry about losing all your money. "
"2365250","2368410"," Put some stops in down below over here in case it rolls over."
"2370010","2370450"," Right."
"2370990","2372110"," We do this every day, right?"
"2372590","2373230"," Every day. "
"2377580","2379400"," You can't get no VWAP bounce today."
"2379580","2380140"," This is trend day."
"2380400","2381100"," I don't think you are. "
"2383020","2385460"," If you want a VWAP bounce here to be looking for."
"2386840","2387520"," Oh, yeah."
"2387520","2387640"," Yeah. "
"2392080","2392920"," The Euro zone."
"2393060","2393880"," Winky knows what's up."
"2393980","2394860"," Winky is like a hater. "
"2394880","2397020"," Winky is now a mochi for all those interested."
"2397500","2399440"," I should have Winky on so Winky can do these things."
"2400100","2401880"," It's probably going to be right about here. "
"2402700","2404680"," We'll trade over it and we'll start to consolidate."
"2405260","2405740"," If I had to guess."
"2407880","2412880"," We'll have Winky do just the consolidation bars. "
"2424130","2424730"," All right."
"2424910","2425770"," We'll make this."
"2425930","2426310"," We'll make the. "
"2426630","2427790"," I'm trying to make the stream."
"2428450","2430010"," Children safe, believe it or not."
"2430470","2432010"," I'm working on that right now. "
"2432010","2434090"," What I need to do is I need to put a sign on the wall."
"2434210","2434490"," It says."
"2436310","2437390"," How you like. "
"2438710","2443410"," I remember what I went to my friends house and they had kids and."
"2444890","2446130"," I was like, where did everybody go?"
"2446570","2449530"," And they were like, oh, they went downstairs to the basement to have a safety meeting."
"2449530","2451230"," And I was like, what is a safety meeting?"
"2452450","2452810"," And. "
"2454630","2456390"," And then I found out what they were doing, of course."
"2456570","2458190"," But I was like, oh, because I don't do that."
"2458390","2458950"," So, but whatever. "
"2460370","2461850"," That their parents were there too."
"2461910","2463690"," So it wasn't any kind of criminality or anything."
"2463810","2466170"," It was like family and friends and that kind of stuff. "
"2467370","2467910"," Right there."
"2468110","2472230"," And, but of course these are."
"2473770","2477290"," You know, 30 year old parents that are like trying to take a safety meeting. "
"2477770","2478990"," So the kids don't see him."
"2485770","2487030"," We don't want kids safe."
"2487230","2487710"," I agree with that. "
"2489110","2489730"," We were."
"2490010","2492370"," If you're looking for a VWAP bounce to catch the."
"2492630","2494390"," You're probably going to wind up chasing this. "
"2494790","2495550"," I'll be honest with you."
"2496290","2498530"," But if you want that VWAP bounce down here, sure."
"2498810","2500850"," My assumption is you're going to wind up chasing this. "
"2503690","2505490"," Usually you wind up chasing this."
"2506010","2507290"," So that's your first one right there."
"2507910","2508750"," First pump right. "
"2510590","2511610"," Came back down."
"2512010","2512630"," Pounced some demand."
"2514690","2516310"," You're more than likely going to chase this. "
"2517030","2517230"," At least."
"2518630","2519270"," You're not a."
"2519590","2521590"," Yeah, 70% chance you're going to chase this."
"2521990","2522910"," To this one right here. "
"2523030","2524050"," I think it chases the one above."
"2528530","2530270"," I'll put that there just now for you."
"2531990","2534870"," And it doesn't always happen, but you know, if. "
"2536050","2537470"," Sometimes you'll get a break and you'll."
"2537730","2540190"," You catch the VWAP, but I'm almost guaranteed."
"2540510","2540790"," You're going to. "
"2544740","2545540"," You're going to wind."
"2545540","2546340"," You're going to wind up."
"2547460","2547940"," Chasing. "
"2553870","2555550"," We call these trend days."
"2568550","2569970"," Keep on chasing that money."
"2570850","2575210"," Oh, yeah, maybe 3D ones are cranking right now. "
"2575810","2576310"," Making bank."
"2579150","2584530"," I'm going to close those out probably up here because they won't make as much money being out of"
"2584530","2584730"," the money."
"2597040","2598920"," I've got some 3D fours as well. "
"2599160","2600640"," Those will start picking up here and value."
"2600940","2601500"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"2609290","2610650"," Take the money and a dollar 21. "
"2612910","2613570"," 3D ones."
"2613890","2617110"," I've still got 3 84s on the board right now."
"2617190","2618710"," 27 cents right now. "
"2626980","2629020"," You might see some consolidation right here too."
"2629440","2632460"," A little bit of consolidation right on right on pivot."
"2633420","2636020"," I'm going to expect this to come up hit this come back down. "
"2636020","2637600"," So we had a little higher."
"2638080","2639520"," And then I'm going to hear some bulls on the track."
"2639720","2641500"," Go and take that by this right here. "
"2641620","2642540"," I'm going to tell you."
"2642940","2643800"," You're late to the party."
"2647900","2649440"," Keep on blasting higher. "
"2656400","2658360"," Keep on blasting on higher."
"2661840","2662820"," 3D 3 would be nice."
"2663240","2665140"," If we can tag 3D 3 or 3D 4 would be stoked. "
"2668600","2670420"," Maybe like a couple of down days."
"2671320","2672420"," Consolidate for a little bit."
"2672600","2673920"," Force pulls into the picture. "
"2674500","2676820"," Look at that big giant green balls right now in the spy."
"2678000","2680660"," Just just smashing and blasting right now."

"2744320","2744760"," They went down. "
"2744900","2745920"," They were like 27 cents."
"2746140","2747140"," Now they're down 21 cents."
"2747540","2749640"," So maybe I'll add to my position here. "
"2751760","2753200"," Maybe I'll add to 383."
"2755180","2755860"," They're more in the money."
"2755860","2770050"," I think"
"2770050","2770450"," around them. "

"4977400","4978840"," This holds this consolidation holds."
"4979480","4982340"," You're going to look for the coil and then the move higher right here."
"4983280","4983920"," Makes sense. "
"4984160","4984580"," Pretty easy."
"4985220","4986620"," Pretty standard easy way to."
"4988760","4989940"," Take this trade higher. "
"4991020","4993880"," If there's liquidity break at some point, you can always jump back in."
"4998240","5004370"," I want to see a failure up here at some point."
"5013260","5015280"," Fifteen minute chart is not safe for work. "
"5015320","5015620"," I agree."
"5018640","5020340"," I don't disagree with that."
"5025660","5027220"," A little bit of a break here. "
"5027360","5027860"," Be careful."
"5028040","5029160"," You get a big red bar coming in."
"5029260","5029520"," Watch out. "
"5031200","5032660"," See that big red bar right there."
"5036500","5040280"," If the if the stream is slow for you, go down to the YouTube."
"5041120","5046400"," Go down to the the cog whale and your YouTube player and click on it. "
"5047880","5054600"," And you can click then the playback button and speed it up 2.5 times or two times the playback"
"5054600","5057840"," and you should be live with me within a few seconds."
"5059240","5062680"," If it's any more delay than that, my voice will get all weird sounding."
"5063880","5065440"," Any more delay than that. "
"5066280","5067720"," That's on your end, not my end."
"5067840","5075420"," YouTube has a native delay in programming or live streams, I should say."
"5076100","5077340"," And you can speed it back up. "
"5077480","5084660"," If you're looking for entry, you can always speed up the YouTube playback so you can hear me close"
"5084660","5085320"," to real time."
"5090490","5092770"," They're really trying to push this down right here."
"5093310","5094970"," Be careful with this red bar right here. "
"5095070","5096250"," You can see that some sellers."
"5097450","5100230"," You could get a break of liquidity down below here."
"5100350","5101390"," So just be conscious of it. "
"5102850","5103890"," Have some stops."
"5104910","5108610"," Even if you get stopped up down down here, you can always reenter."
"5112880","5114520"," And take a look at the five minute chart. "
"5114740","5115260"," See where."
"5117260","5124820"," So then the five minute chart that 20, 20 EMA is slightly above the slightly above the."
"5126280","5127320"," The VWAP. "
"5128020","5130140"," So we'll take a look back on."
"5133670","5135090"," VWAP is going to come right back."
"5135310","5138190"," VWAP is going to be or the 20 EMA in the five minutes going to be. "
"5139490","5140290"," Hold on here."
"5145530","5149590"," So your 20 EMA is slightly above here."
"5150690","5151830"," Still consolidating here. "
"5153250","5157150"," So if we do roll it over or something like this, this would be the continuation trade."
"5164190","5165150"," Still haven't given up."
"5165150","5168430"," We're starting to slightly getting in there with the one minute. "
"5187510","5188570"," I keep missing the."
"5188710","5191910"," So this is the second time I tried to buy somewhere down here."
"5191910","5192730"," I didn't face it. "
"5193190","5197710"," And I just tried to buy this right now and it wouldn't let me in as well."
"5197870","5200210"," Maybe it's forcing me to chase every time we come down here."
"5200270","5202330"," It's forcing me to chase to take this higher. "
"5202890","5204710"," So I'm missing these bottoms here."
"5209410","5210730"," So you get a lot of strength there."
"5220870","5221730"," I'm in now. "
"5221890","5222310"," Now I'm in."
"5223230","5224370"," I'm in now, baby."
"5233650","5235710"," See if I can break through these sellers. "
"5250480","5251240"," Come on."
"5252380","5253420"," Show me our one."
"5254160","5257180"," We only have five fucking down days and you're going to roll the market right here. "
"5261820","5262340"," Probably."
"5265920","5267140"," That's how it goes right."
"5271060","5274020"," I can't even squeeze in our one off on an update. "
"5280520","5282600"," The second half of the day will be pathetic."
"5283580","5284500"," The bulls are pathetic."
"5306670","5308350"," Yeah, it's looking kind of rolling here. "
"5313670","5317430"," Any normal day, I'd say expected to roll over down here."
"5317590","5325090"," The 20 EMA is just above the up right here."
"5327410","5328430"," Five down days. "
"5328990","5329330"," I don't know."
"5329710","5332050"," I don't know if we'll see the up until it's done."
"5332630","5335390"," And you're going to remember back here that these buyers stepped in. "
"5335550","5339110"," It looks like they might have came out again over here, but it's hard."
"5339110","5342410"," It's hard to not give it to the to the bulls to some extent."
"5343870","5345010"," To have a trend day. "
"5345690","5348550"," I think they get the failure above here by our one."
"5349210","5351050"," But I don't think they actually tag our one."
"5354360","5356200"," But I don't think the bulls are done yet today. "
"5356460","5358300"," It's only been what time is it now 10 51."
"5359100","5361340"," You know, nine 30 to 10 51."
"5361780","5365160"," We have an hour and a half of bullishness and after five straight down days. "
"5366520","5369040"," I'll give a little bit of extra to the bulls today."
"5398360","5399420"," What are you saying here, Chase?"
"5402320","5403660"," Which time period do you want?"
"5403780","5405280"," You want the one minute, the five minute or the 15?"
"5405460","5406380"," I can show them all if you like."
"5410260","5410620"," Yeah. "
"5410700","5411720"," A couple more days is bullshit."
"5412040","5412240"," I agree."
"5412560","5415940"," I think I think you see a I think you're going to see an attempt here. "
"5416440","5419360"," I think by like 11 30 12, you'll see an attempt at our one."
"5419960","5422560"," You'll see a failure consolidation."
"5422560","5425880"," And then some late buyers. "
"5426620","5427440"," And then you're going to see."
"5428520","5429860"," Maybe a couple days of consolidation."
"5430460","5431300"," Then a rip a rip. "
"5431500","5432400"," I could be wrong in that."
"5435960","5437540"," And then you'll see that ripped to 390."
"5441400","5445880"," Remember, this is horseshoes and hand grades when I'm talking over three or four days. "
"5449300","5451920"," So being like happy, said this and Kathy said that."
"5451920","5455180"," At the end of the day, it's all about making money, right?"
"5455420","5456860"," That's what means more than anything."
"5462860","5465540"," The last trade that traded with conviction I saw was bankrupt. "
"5473880","5475460"," Three, three, five is sort of a pin."
"5476240","5476600"," Yeah."
"5477560","5480180"," Well, no, well, this is we've got negative gamma hair. "
"5480280","5480980"," We know that for sure."
"5481400","5482880"," Or not negative, we got zero gamma hair."
"5485340","5486240"," So we're in a pot. "
"5486240","5488680"," We're not going to, we're not going to sell the rip violently here."
"5488900","5489680"," We can promise you that."
"5489940","5494400"," We're not going to like, you're not going to, you shouldn't see like, uh, you shouldn't see like,"
"5494540","5495960"," uh, you know, like this kind of stuff. "
"5497300","5499360"," Um, this or hold on."
"5500580","5503740"," Uh, just so you know, if you don't know."
"5505260","5506900"," Uh, we're not in this. "
"5508080","5510120"," Uh, so this is where you sell the rip."
"5510360","5514240"," Anything down here is like, you know, if you squeeze up, you're going to expect."
"5514240","5516800"," Uh, this is sell the rip. "
"5518400","5522140"," Anything here and above has become supportive intraday."
"5522680","5525300"," You can see that we had support right here, right?"
"5526160","5532340"," Uh, we should grind higher until we meet, you know, each level we should grind higher until we meet"
"5532340","5533020"," some resistance."
"5533900","5537660"," Even when we roll over, it should be rolling over looking for support. "
"5538800","5541760"," Um, shouldn't just be like a fucking bloodbath up here."
"5541760","5543620"," Now, you don't get super bullish."
"5547080","5550460"," Until you're up here, consolidation, this move higher. "
"5552420","5553460"," This is our one."
"5553680","5555240"," I send you guys this these every morning."
"5559250","5564630"," And even if this is distribution, you can see that it's not, you know, just bloodbath and down. "
"5569780","5575780"," Just the behavior of this is not, uh, bearish or, you know, sell the rip type behavior."
"5576400","5579520"," Even if it rolls, it's not sell the rip."
"5588950","5591730"," Looks more like just ripping down, um, sellers. "
"5592370","5594870"," It's trying to grind through sellers right now."
"5599720","5602780"," Still sitting above the, uh, 20 M and the one minute."
"5605120","5608160"," If we have to get out and find more, more buyers, so be it. "
"5610660","5611840"," Good place to reload."
"5633350","5638650"," Uh, every day support resistance levels are, uh, pivots from previous day."
"5639970","5641370"," Previous high previous lows. "
"5642010","5646490"," And then, uh, I download all the SPX information for the gamma every day."
"5647870","5652610"," And I put it on a pivot table, uh, with black school with a black school's equation."
"5653230","5656410"," Kind of where all the puts and calls are in the market. "
"5657010","5664650"," Um, we're trying to add in, um, total market and then separating it by day."
"5665130","5668790"," Right now we're doing total market, but now I'm trying to separate it by day as well."
"5669190","5674210"," And I'm trying to add in, uh, a thank man stocks and other indexes as well. "
"5674970","5676950"," So that we can have a full picture of the market."
"5678170","5679390"," It's just taking me some time."
"5679650","5681050"," I'm working with developers and stuff. "
"5682810","5686010"," I was working with my kids and my wife, but it's getting so complicated and."
"5686010","5689550"," Um, I need to."
"5690790","5694630"," Work with some other people that can, uh, put some stuff on the website so you guys can just plug"
"5694630","5695250"," in like Tesla. "
"5696070","5697270"," And find out where the levels are."
"5705900","5707280"," It's like a five minute chart."
"5708960","5710220"," That beautiful thing. "
"5711700","5712840"," Just monster and."
"5713520","5717920"," Kind of a battle to the bulls and the bears here."
"5717920","5720760"," Battles in bulls and bears, bears, bulls win an excuse me. "
"5720880","5724580"," The same battle going on right now with the bulls and bears in the five minute chart."
"5726520","5728540"," Bull's seem to be winning this battle right now."
"5730040","5730940"," Fifteen minute chart. "
"5731260","5731840"," Same kind of a deal."
"5731980","5732460"," You can see the."
"5733200","5735840"," See the nice, nice green wick down below here. "
"5737040","5740120"," Uh, bulls trying to try to fight above these sellers."
"5740480","5741540"," You can see that on the dome."
"5741680","5742320"," The on the order flow. "
"5743460","5744680"," Bull's can break out here."
"5744840","5746520"," The next target above is three three."
"5747880","5748620"," If you're. "
"5753100","5754740"," Looking for some targets above."
"5755720","5760140"," Uh, we've got our two here at, uh, three, six, twenty five."
"5760140","5761240"," We have a gap to fill above. "
"5762200","5765440"," Between three to eight and three, nine, thirty four."
"5767180","5770660"," Right now we have like, you know, I got a battle of the wheels right on the fifteen minute charts"
"5770660","5772400"," like, you know, half bulls, half bears."
"5772400","5774780"," Bears trying to pound this down right now. "
"5775520","5778820"," On the five minute chart, if you want to say, hey, we're going to stay there."
"5778900","5779500"," Bullish here."
"5781160","5782580"," Uh, this is the famous. "
"5782580","5784040"," Did I mark the seventy seven?"
"5784540","5785620"," Uh, twenty EMA."
"5785860","5786940"," Right traded above it."
"5787300","5787740"," Right. "
"5788980","5791980"," And your fallback point is going to be right now."
"5793040","5794980"," Let's call it like a three eighty one."
"5795840","5796780"," Somewhere in there. "
"5797080","5799160"," And then you got VWAP down below here as well."
"5808350","5809970"," So three eighty one right here."
"5811990","5814170"," Place that receiving a clean this up. "
"5818580","5819820"," So here's three eighty one."
"5819840","5823580"," This would be where the five minute eight eight EMA is."
"5824260","5824980"," And we've got the. "
"5831580","5833420"," Let me put it back in the five minute for you."
"5836040","5838080"," You can see where the five minute is."
"5862860","5865420"," You guys want this line color different than blue. "
"5866380","5867800"," Or is blue okay for you."
"5868060","5869080"," You prefer a different color."
"5869720","5872760"," You want it like green or yellow or something or red may. "
"5872840","5877240"," You have to sell forty five billion dollars in four week bills on December 22nd."
"5877380","5879180"," To settle on December the twenty seven."
"5887170","5891590"," Uh, as you're asking, if we were to, if we were to, if we were to think. "
"5891790","5892490"," Oh, see what we're seeing."
"5900790","5901930"," Yeah, one forty four."
"5901930","5903010"," I like one thirty six. "
"5903230","5905970"," I want to see like a, I like the idea of one one."
"5905970","5908790"," I think I've got one forty four to one thirty six or something."
"5909190","5910630"," It's a, it's a, you know, like a band. "
"5912230","5916150"," And then I want to see when the market actually blood baths."
"5916190","5918010"," I want to see like ninety six dollars."
"5920210","5923950"," I was thinking that we wouldn't get down to the sixties or forties, but. "
"5924510","5926090"," I'm starting to get more bearish."
"5926630","5927910"," As time moves on."
"5928390","5931170"," And we might see the, uh, we might actually see that. "
"5932530","5935190"," Real real real stretch lower bound on Tesla."
"5936010","5938710"," You guys prefer big green line, big blue line."
"5941070","5942430"," Blue green doesn't matter. "
"5942690","5942990"," Okay."
"5944110","5949070"," A Superman saying Captain, if we were to, if we were to think of where the puck is going, like"
"5949070","5950930"," the next JPM caller, et cetera."
"5951170","5953510"," Would it make sense for the next bet would be lower on the spy. "
"5953510","5954830"," If this one is rolled."
"5955570","5955990"," More downs."
"5956190","5956330"," Okay. "
"5956530","5958350"," So there's right now there's three."
"5959110","5960890"," Collars that JPM has out."
"5961550","5962290"," They've hit one. "
"5962510","5965150"," They have two more already for January and February, I believe."
"5966710","5967650"," That are lower."
"5968150","5972010"," I do, I do want you to be aware when, when we're trading to the JPM caller. "
"5973670","5976450"," Um, if at some point the market bottoms."
"5976930","5979290"," The JPM caller typically doesn't hit."
"5980710","5981750"," Uh, exactly. "
"5983390","5986870"," It's been hitting in this down market, but just be aware of that down the road."
"5987010","5988430"," If the market ever turns around."
"5989190","5990730"," Be real careful with JPM caller. "
"5992510","5997090"," Um, it's been very accurate since the market rolled in early January."
"5997510","5998890"," Just be careful of it."
"6000650","6006610"," Uh, but I do agree that the market trades to the trades to the JPM caller right now. "
"6006850","6008410"," And there's a, there's two more on."
"6008850","6010630"," So you can just do a quick Twitter search."
"6010630","6012850"," I think the lower bounds are 3370. "
"6014030","6015970"," And do I think we're rolling down there?"
"6016050","6016230"," I do."
"6016510","6017350"," I don't know that we're going to."
"6017750","6018670"," I don't know. "
"6018770","6020630"," We're going to roll down there right away."
"6025750","6028450"," Um, but we're not done going down if that's your question."
"6028450","6029970"," So, so ready. "
"6030250","6032330"," I'm going to give you my short medium and long term."
"6032990","6033310"," Right now."
"6034690","6035550"," Short term. "
"6041970","6042890"," I think."
"6043610","6044330"," Shorting in here."
"6044430","6045290"," It's not safe. "
"6045450","6045810"," You can."
"6045810","6046910"," We might go down more."
"6047130","6047410"," Just not. "
"6047750","6049030"," Some of the meat of the trade is."
"6050010","6053690"," So you do want bears want the bulls to."
"6054810","6058090"," Uh, at least get 390 or close to it. "
"6058910","6062130"," Cause what it does is it leaves room for them to take out 350."
"6063110","6063550"," Right."
"6063670","6066730"," If you get close to 390, it's like, Oh, there's 400 points down there. "
"6067190","6070550"," Or close to it, like 350 points for us to short down into."
"6070550","6073010"," So you can take a meat of that trade."
"6073730","6074390"," Shorting the market. "
"6075530","6080710"," Uh, because the more we, the more we get closer to closer to oversold conditions."
"6081330","6082430"," The risk here it gets, right?"
"6082910","6085210"," Even doesn't matter if we have trending down trending up."
"6086210","6088430"," Um, doesn't matter. "
"6088630","6093170"," So, um, if you're a barrier, like I want to, I want to shorten safety."
"6093530","6094530"," I don't want to be shortened down."
"6094710","6095970"," I don't want to be long at the top. "
"6096130","6096370"," Do I?"
"6097290","6100030"," I don't want to be like, even just today in an intraday."
"6100030","6102490"," Do I want to have all my eggs in my basket right here?"
"6102650","6102790"," No."
"6103570","6106230"," Um, do I, you know, do I think we're getting up here?"
"6106310","6106550"," Yes. "
"6106550","6110090"," But do I want, you know, every last dollar that I have in this last little push?"
"6110610","6110630"," No."
"6111750","6116690"," Um, so like a meat of the trade and then, uh, the end of the trade, you can make some"
"6116690","6118550"," money off of, but that doesn't mean that."
"6120730","6122810"," Um, you know, your balls to the walls. "
"6123250","6126350"," So you can sort of short time period."
"6127110","6129570"," I think bears and bulls want to see a relief rally."
"6129570","6131210"," A retracement, right?"
"6133530","6136730"," Um, we can look, we'll look at a retracement right now. "
"6137070","6141520"," So, hold on a second here."
"6146800","6147200"," Okay."
"6147400","6149260"," Let's pretend this is a retracement here, right?"
"6149840","6153920"," So you've got, well, let's pretend, let's pretend that we know right now. "
"6154520","6156380"," We're going to make an educated guess that retracement has begun."
"6157520","6159880"," Uh, we can do, what do you want to do it off of 414?"
"6159880","6161160"," You want to do it off right here?"
"6170340","6174440"," So 23% is just above R1, right?"
"6176500","6177980"," 38% is R3."
"6179500","6180000"," 61%. "
"6180880","6182500"," This is where the gap is, right?"
"6183920","6184620"," You see that 396?"
"6185300","6186380"," That's the 61%."
"6186920","6191820"," So let's say first day you're going to get, uh, 23%, right?"
"6192780","6194420"," Come back down for a couple days, right?"
"6194860","6195800"," Come back up here."
"6196460","6198700"," And you get the 38% retracement. "
"6199080","6202840"," If it extends, let's say, and you close the gap at 61%."
"6202840","6208640"," This is a good place for, uh, bears to, to be here or here."
"6209380","6213600"," For bears to just start coming in and feel confident. "
"6213780","6217920"," Uh, so on a medium timeframe, medium, like medium view is bearish, right?"
"6219080","6223480"," Um, and so I'm, I'm bearish on a medium timeframe right here."
"6223480","6231660"," And then you're looking for either closing or an attempt to fill that gap, right?"
"6232080","6235240"," Even if it's a failure, come down, smash this one."
"6235980","6238720"," Maybe a small bump and then we come back down and hit here. "
"6238820","6240920"," This is where the weekly moving average is too."
"6241680","6244740"," Now, if you're a bear, you, you know, you're short, you're, you're short at all this."
"6244920","6245480"," You short this. "
"6245640","6246140"," You short this."
"6246580","6247540"," What do you do down here?"
"6247860","6248720"," You close shop again."
"6249100","6254200"," We're going to wait for us to get underneath the weekly moving average to then take cross trade. "
"6254360","6255020"," And now to be right."
"6255280","6255340"," One."
"6255560","6256220"," So you're not. "
"6256240","6259820"," And industry, because what if we blast off here, right?"
"6259960","6263060"," You'd be, if we could blast it off here and never came back, we'd be fucked, right?"
"6264640","6268920"," Or if we stepped it down over time to 3100 and didn't have a bloodbath."
"6269860","6271480"," Um, you get caught in that too."
"6271480","6272880"," So where's the meat of the trade?"
"6273580","6274540"," Here's the meat of the bear trade. "
"6275320","6277060"," You don't want to mess with this shit down here."
"6277800","6278120"," Right?"
"6278380","6280140"," And here's the meat of the next bear trade."
"6280340","6281820"," And here's the meat of the next bear trade. "
"6282020","6282700"," The meat of it, at least."
"6283160","6286760"," The safety part of it's, you know, somewhere in there, somewhere in there."
"6288480","6288800"," Right?"
"6289120","6291840"," And then, you know, somewhere down here is the, the meat of the bear trade. "
"6292920","6294620"," And it'll make it always messes on the chart."
"6301900","6303460"," So if you're a bear, that's what you want."
"6303720","6306040"," Now, does that mean we don't roll down a hell?"
"6306840","6310580"," No, but it means that you know where the pivot point is, right?"
"6310580","6311620"," Pivot points right here. "
"6312580","6316120"," So if they start rolling us down below zero gamma, right?"
"6316740","6320300"," And we don't get our retracement trade, right?"
"6321220","6324920"," Once you hit this negative gamma, you know that it's going to get violent down here."
"6325640","6327800"," And you can pick that up with safety, right?"
"6328300","6331880"," Those tried, they failed, couldn't do it, couldn't put a retracement together."
"6333500","6338220"," Bring on lower lows, bring on 373, bring on that kind of stuff. "
"6338220","6340340"," But you want to get through this pivot if you're a bear."
"6341200","6342620"," You know, in a bear, you should be waiting."
"6343840","6348140"," If you're a bear and you see us get underneath this pivot, you can take this trade right here. "
"6348680","6352440"," If you want to get real bearish, the next big trade would be down here, right?"
"6352600","6353480"," Below the negative gamma."
"6354900","6357320"," To make sense, you can take this trade, take that trade."
"6359660","6361440"," But here you wouldn't be bearish. "
"6361620","6365100"," Here you want to wait for a break below this, right?"
"6366260","6368920"," This is where you get bear, this is where you can get bear on right there."
"6370140","6373200"," And bears will tell you, well, I took a put right here."
"6374500","6377120"," It's so risky, like there's no need to put on that. "
"6377320","6380340"," If you put this much risk on all the time, you're going to fucking blow up your account eventually."
"6382820","6383800"," You want some confirmation?"
"6401080","6402280"," Wait a minute here, hold on."
"6407250","6411030"," And shit, I'm only given the retracement to 404, not even 414. "
"6411990","6412930"," We haven't even discussed."
"6414550","6418090"," Like you want to see some retracement, we start stretching this out some more down here."
"6418670","6420430"," You wait to see that retracement. "
"6420890","6426610"," If we just go down to 373 and you look at a retracement from 414 to 373, you're talking about"
"6426610","6429390"," like a 300 point fucking face ripper in one day."
"6430990","6433210"," What fucking bear wants to get caught in that shit?"
"6434050","6435750"," Can you imagine like a 300 point day?"
"6436810","6438150"," You'd have a margin call."
"6438610","6439370"," I don't know. "
"6439410","6443090"," I don't know who you are, how wealthy you are, but you'd be on margin call."
"6446730","6453190"," The issues of missing bowels re-emerges in early 2023, keeping up with the same path of closer"
"6453190","6454110"," estimating, to 1."
"6454270","6463800"," I don't want us to say about that topic."
"6466300","6468280"," So the deeper you go, the deeper you go. "
"6468280","6472840"," So this happens in crashes, right?"
"6473060","6477820"," We'll crash down three, four, five hundred points to come right back up 500 points, same day, the"
"6477820","6478520"," next day or something."
"6486510","6490530"," So if you're getting bears here, you want to see the break of, this is a pivot point."
"6491550","6493070"," You want to see the break of this right here?"
"6494350","6495310"," Because we can get it underneath this. "
"6496910","6497870"," There's a trade right there."
"6499390","6500510"," I'm actually gonna take it to here."
"6525480","6527560"," I'm gonna think about it, enter a trade here, hold up. "

"7727610","7730970"," This big line right here is right about here. "
"7733510","7736990"," You can see this is just the congestive area that it's in right here."
"7738250","7740650"," If you want to see that blue line that's down below."
"7743070","7744990"," This just kind of disappeared in here. "

"7750630","7753690"," You can see where this support is down here."
"7762750","7764150"," That's this area right here. "
"7785460","7786400"," Where's 380?"
"7793600","7796660"," It's still a little price of 80 cents for 380 C's."
"7797820","7826130"," The bull's"
"7826130","7827410"," trying to climb back right now."
"7829130","7831770"," The seller is above here at 3140. "
"7834610","7837730"," I'll probably turn this into hard sell for right now."
"7839550","7842130"," I'm probably not getting back up here at any point."
"7843930","7850330"," The second band right here is where some more sellers are. "
"7852870","7856890"," You want to see this EMA get retaken if you're a bull here."
"7857530","7859390"," You want to take this bull trade you want to see."
"7860570","7862210"," I might pick some up here in just a minute. "
"7862370","7864110"," Some calls if we can get above this right here."
"7865890","7867450"," We'll take that trade right there."
"7870410","7873230"," If they tee off this though if they tee off this. "
"7874350","7875310"," You can see."
"7878530","7881170"," They might try to send this right back down right here."
"7882890","7885150"," You want to see a trade higher than this blue line. "
"7899540","7901580"," You total fucking bull trap up here."
"7901920","7905260"," This is straight up bull trap couldn't even get to R1."
"7905780","7910160"," I was expecting a failure above like somewhere up in here. "
"7910880","7913520"," But they went right bull balls to the wall."
"7914420","7915260"," Very bearish."
"7916160","7918020"," The fact that you couldn't even get up to R1. "
"7918240","7918820"," Hold on a second here."
"7921120","7922580"," We've seen this before too."
"7922580","7928400"," We've seen this when we're on top last week or two weeks ago. "
"7929200","7932520"," We had days where we couldn't put anything together here."
"7933260","7935680"," We didn't even get up to this R1 to get a rejection."
"7936780","7938520"," This rejection says pretty significant. "
"7939320","7940920"," Even if we trade up higher here."
"7941660","7943740"," I don't think we are."
"7944000","7947980"," This is so bearish not being able to get above the previous low from the day before. "
"7948580","7949260"," Hold on."
"7949760","7951580"," Let's look at the day before here."
"7956700","7963020"," I'm actually kind of shocked here because you kind of see and that's like right here. "
"7965080","7969020"," You get the double bottom here right one bottom two bottoms."
"7969420","7974080"," You're going to kind of expect the bit the bulls to at least make an attempt up here."
"7974880","7976820"," And they were just told fuck you know you're going down. "
"7977720","7981760"," I guess you call this a triple bottom here but one two and three."
"7982880","7985480"," This is kind of like the last kind of stand for bulls."
"7985680","7990860"," The bulls can't put this together and get up here and you're like a three-try failure. "
"7991500","7995040"," You're going to be looking for bears to come straight in and just start sending this down."
"7996200","7999160"," It's kind of like a last standing here for bulls."
"8000200","8004480"," They can't reclaim this blue line right here and take this up. "
"8004680","8010660"," If the bears just tee off on this you can expect blood down to like 373 easily."
"8011480","8013420"," Blood down to 373 down here."
"8014340","8015360"," Can't have bulls. "
"8017200","8022700"," You shouldn't be failing here on this double bottom over two days."
"8023600","8024940"," Not even getting our one."
"8025300","8028940"," The fact that it's a one here. "
"8030880","8034040"," The fact that you've got bears recommitting right here is wild."
"8034580","8036100"," Like boom one, boom two."
"8036760","8041640"," It's just not good for not good. "
"8041820","8044960"," The zero gammas here and negative gammas down below here today."
"8045700","8050320"," But seeing this throw over like this, just another committed day for bears."
"8051020","8052440"," Bears like fuck you know. "
"8055520","8062280"," So this is very critical here for bulls to hold here."
"8062400","8063120"," If you don't hold here."
"8064600","8068120"," Dude right here 100%. "
"8069340","8070360"," That's where you're going."
"8071880","8072960"," 372, 373."
"8074420","8078960"," You'll get your gap close here and it'll be a disaster for the bulls. "
"8079960","8081280"," Straight straight up disaster."
"8083420","8088760"," If the bulls are able to, you know, thought process of the bulls are able to distribute down here."
"8088760","8090700"," Stay at least above it. "
"8090780","8092780"," Stay around here the next couple days."
"8093760","8095200"," Consolidation two more days."
"8095560","8097180"," They can make another run higher. "
"8097580","8102680"," But this early in the game being pushed down shows zero conviction by bulls."
"8103820","8104340"," Zero."
"8106060","8108300"," So the bulls have it in their court right now. "
"8108480","8110840"," I would say this is fourth quarter for bulls right here."
"8111360","8113580"," They have to get something."
"8114720","8116520"," If they don't get something. "
"8117680","8119860"," I'm going to go like super bears here."
"8122080","8124500"," You pretty start breaking down through this right here."
"8124500","8128240"," It's going to get fucking ugly for the for the bulls. "
"8129620","8132800"," Like ugly ugly."
"8135840","8141020"," This is kind of like this is kind of like breaking above into positive gamma."
"8141020","8141980"," If we were up here. "
"8142960","8144180"," I'd be like pack it up bears."
"8145160","8146980"," And I didn't even expect that today."
"8147040","8148260"," I was expecting a failure here. "
"8148380","8151160"," Just trap more bulls in for some consolidation."
"8151600","8154360"," But when you just sit, when you see like you can't maintain the day before."
"8155200","8160280"," If you start breaking down here, it's going to be like let's close the gap down below it. "
"8160360","8160660"," 375."
"8161260","8162740"," Let's close the gap down below over there."
"8163680","8166120"," You're going to get your bear suit on heavy here. "
"8166660","8169120"," So we're going to find out right now big green by right here."
"8169120","8170180"," Some buyers stepping in."
"8171340","8172860"," We're going to see what goes on. "
"8172860","8173780"," It's a big pivot point."
"8174040","8178500"," And then the pivot says here, but this is a major directional shift here if we go lower."
"8183600","8184680"," So let's see what happens. "
"8185800","8204950"," This is"
"8204950","8208309"," just kind of like trying to like look at this from the perspective of two days."
"8210230","8211370"," Can't be given this stuff."
"8211549","8213969"," If you're a bull, you can't you can't give this stuff up. "
"8214230","8214830"," Not that early."
"8216070","8217209"," Not that early in the game."
"8221570","8223049"," Let's see if I can move. "
"8223270","8224270"," Let me zoom in with this back up."
"8231790","8234350"," You can already see the resistance forming here."
"8235930","8241510"," White House is Kirby says the US is monitoring COVID situation in China and urges all countries to"
"8241510","8242830"," include focus on vaccines. "
"8260309","8263709"," You can actually just put this right here."
"8263790","8265230"," Now you can see this forming, right?"
"8265230","8267110"," This is where sellers are stepping up here."
"8268430","8270150"," And they are like, fuck no. "
"8278559","8279639"," Let's see if I get that right."
"8281920","8285480"," You need a bull's need to break a break through this right here."
"8286000","8286500"," It's like critical. "
"8292500","8293440"," Have to break."
"8298760","8301660"," Must have it must have a mid afternoon rally here."
"8322650","8325830"," Half the turn this and half the reclaim this. "
"8325969","8330129"," If you don't reclaim this, man, if bulls don't reclaim this right here, fucking good night."
"8339180","8345500"," White House is Kirby says the US monitoring of China's COVID situation includes potential impacts"
"8345500","8350920"," on US companies and supply chains, although administration has worked to build up resiliency."

"8382370","8384450"," Come on bulls."
"8388320","8390600"," Just straight up bull trap right here."

"8394360","8397340"," You see this right underneath right here and just boom. "
"8398980","8402240"," And the bears are just in here selling, selling right now."

"8428220","8429740"," Let's see if we can get a better look here. "
"8433030","8434950"," This is a five minute right here, right?"
"8437430","8438690"," Just look at this too."
"8438790","8439530"," It's time passes."
"8440130","8442530"," I think it's time passes right here, right?"
"8442670","8443610"," This is a five minute chart. "
"8445150","8446550"," Here's that line right there."
"8446710","8447610"," This is following now."
"8450870","8451830"," Just following. "
"8452070","8454970"," You see this, you see this EMA right here, this 20 EMA."

"8552040","8555100"," Bonds greater than NQ greater than SPYES."
"8556260","8558380"," Boofcap, can you pull up Tesla or a masochist?"
"8558900","8561540"," 1,300 breaks goes into free fall. "
"8561700","8561920"," I agree."
"8562660","8566900"," If bears hold this right here, if I'm telling you out if the bears hold this right here, it's not"
"8566900","8567640"," going to be fucking pretty."
"8568980","8570320"," They can hold this right here. "
"8570440","8573640"," It is, it is, it is game over for bulls, right?"
"8573820","8577420"," This is like aliens, game over, man, game over, whatever he says."
"8578760","8580300"," You don't want to see this."
"8580560","8584720"," This is, this is fucking textbook right here. "
"8584720","8585920"," So I don't know."
"8586240","8588680"," We'll see if the bulls can hold it here or if not."
"8589260","8593040"," You could call this a, you could call this a double triple bottom, or you want to call it, but"
"8593040","8596460"," I'll tell you what, man, if you're a bull, you don't want to see that. "
"8597120","8602420"," You don't want to see, you've got the, you've got the first bottom here, right?"
"8602880","8604320"," Nice big bottom buyer stepped in."
"8604820","8606820"," We know big buyers stepped in here."
"8607640","8610760"," And this roll like this, this quick, just being thrown down. "
"8612020","8614060"," You know, bulls have to work, man."
"8614060","8619560"," Like you, you got to see more commitment from bulls to at least get up here a little bit."
"8619580","8623260"," I mean, the fact that you can't even attack R1 is a problem. "
"8624120","8625180"," I'll be honest with you."
"8625640","8626480"," This is beautiful."
"8626760","8628220"," This is constructive for a bull. "
"8628960","8636360"," I'm game on the bull trade here, but I'll tell you what, when you see the role that deep, the"
"8636360","8638800"," fact that you can't break these sellers right here."
"8642140","8644380"," You know, you got this move here, this move here."
"8645600","8648120"," And, you know, they sent it down on you, right?"
"8648460","8650100"," Sent it down on you, said no. "
"8650920","8652920"," Came back up and they told you no, right?"
"8653660","8657180"," And now this is kind of a weak, kind of weak right here, right?"
"8657320","8659060"," You didn't see a hammer candle, did you?"
"8659940","8664020"," So you're not seeing like the strength of fuck no here."
"8664440","8668640"," So if you're not seeing a hammer candle here, they're going to try to throw it over to you until"
"8668640","8669580"," they do."
"8671040","8675300"," So we'll see how this plays out, but I'll tell you what, this isn't constructive to me. "
"8677340","8679940"," I don't like seeing this much time spent here."
"8680140","8683080"," You want to see like, boom, down here."
"8683220","8685900"," You want to see, I'm long, I'm not selling here. "
"8687020","8688640"," So we'll see how this plays out right now."
"8690960","8694000"," See if this can break out right here or not."
"8695320","8697900"," This is like, do or die for the bulls here. "
"8699840","8702600"," You got a gap above here needs to be filled."
"8703040","8708040"," Like, if you can't fill this gap up here, it's going to get, it's going to get saucy."
"8711260","8713800"," If they tee off of the salon right here, it's going to get nasty. "
"8723420","8724680"," So let's see if it gets nasty."
"8730580","8731480"," What are you guys saying?"
"8732660","8734160"," You're excited by Tesla 30."
"8734360","8735940"," I want to buy it at, I want to buy it at 96. "
"8736940","8739960"," But if I can get it at like 60, I think it's 60 and 46."
"8740240","8743180"," I think I've got some tags down there for Tesla."
"8746120","8748360"," Yeah, Mike Wilson said it all rallies will be sold. "
"8748760","8751800"," Yeah, I don't know if that's, I don't know if that's 100% true."
"8753200","8756580"," You can tell right now that you can tell that somebody's buying it."
"8757600","8760620"," Even if he is selling it, that doesn't mean people aren't buying it. "
"8760740","8762520"," Because you can see the computers are buying down here."
"8766020","8767440"," Patiently waiting to re-short be well."
"8770700","8772300"," We love to see spy flush. "
"8772780","8774180"," This is a big flush right here."
"8774740","8776640"," This one right here, I will say this."
"8776800","8777860"," This is a big flush right here. "
"8778880","8780720"," You know, this is a huge flush."
"8781500","8785360"," If you want to get bearish again, man, dude, like, yeah, right there."
"8785360","8788920"," Like, this is uber bearish right here. "
"8789660","8793420"," This is like, start greasing it up bearish."
"8794740","8799760"," Let me see what else you guys saying."
"8800860","8803180"," Uh, nasty bear flag forming in five minute chart. "
"8803960","8804040"," Yeah."
"8805180","8808660"," I want to see if this, uh, I want to see if this gets sold right here."
"8809480","8811080"," We're going to, we're going to find out if it does. "
"8813880","8817120"," This is, this is the on that right or."
"8817680","8820340"," I'm aware of this up here."
"8820340","8821740"," This new bar that came in of sellers. "
"8823240","8824340"," It's roughly."
"8826200","8828620"," First rollover right there."
"8829560","8830940"," Right there. "
"8833260","8834440"," Roughly right here."
"8836440","8838400"," Is where that bar is above."
"8847600","8848600"," Somewhere right there. "
"8865540","8867240"," Let me fix about here alone."
"8890040","8891300"," I'm pretty impressed, man."
"8891480","8893940"," This is pretty wild seeing seeing this cell that early. "
"8894180","8894980"," I'm shocked at that."
"8897880","8900320"," Doesn't show any conviction by bulls right now."
"8900320","8903800"," We're not bulls, but buyers that were higher here. "
"8903960","8905320"," This gets thrown over that early."
"8907720","8909880"," So whatever banks buying these bottoms."
"8911960","8913800"," They need some push down here. "
"8915300","8918340"," They got to call the intern that's working back in New York and say."
"8919140","8920980"," Max by power right here."
"8922740","8926640"," And Mike Wilson's like calling from the Hamptons. "
"8927420","8929980"," And he's like max cell power above over here."
"8932140","8934100"," For Bill Ackman and Carl Eichen."
"8945210","8948590"," Yeah, I can see the point that the defending right here, but I'm telling you. "
"8948730","8949570"," This isn't good."
"8949730","8950450"," You don't want to see this."
"8950670","8954990"," Like you want to see a conviction like five minute or 15 minute candle here. "
"8957630","8959690"," This is a nice candle right here."
"8959830","8960510"," This is a nice blue candle."
"8961310","8963690"," This is a three thousand three million. "
"8963890","8964630"," This is pretty good actually."
"8965810","8967030"," This buying right here."
"8968550","8972210"," I'm going to see this push higher, but these sellers are up here again, waiting. "
"8973750","8974770"," I thought we'd break there."
"8974850","8976270"," Pretty close to breaking through up here."
"8976430","8979590"," I think they started with like 230 or 260 standing orders. "
"8980030","8984630"," Went down to like 150, 160, 130 and they just came right in and started selling it."
"8988230","8989070"," Three million."
"8989770","8991530"," We'll see three million right here. "
"8991790","8994270"," I'm a three point six, two million right here."
"8995050","8997710"," And another 22.5 million right here."
"8998110","9000070"," This is only three million buyers right here. "
"9000190","9002090"," So it's not that good."
"9002610","9003750"," Three point five million."
"9004150","9004710"," You know what?"
"9004830","9005230"," Maybe you're right. "
"9005790","9008750"," Maybe this is a pretty big green bar right here."
"9011070","9012590"," It was three million volume."
"9012790","9013770"," This three million volume. "
"9014350","9015570"," Three point two."
"9016790","9017750"," Three point four."
"9022440","9023780"," Could be stronger than it looks. "
"9028120","9030420"," This is where the big candle was right here back here."
"9033290","9034590"," I might take that trade with you."
"9034790","9035370"," Hold on a second. "
"9044280","9045900"," I might want to take this trade up here."
"9046120","9048120"," If we can get over here, I'll take it with you."
"9049000","9050280"," We have to get above here though. "
"9050400","9051120"," I want to see us above."
"9052600","9053720"," I'll take that trade with you."
"9054520","9056200"," I don't want to see it get thrown down though. "
"9056340","9057240"," We start doing this nonsense."
"9058760","9060640"," Start that grind down right here."
"9065400","9066300"," Give me a second. "
"9076560","9077640"," I'll take that trade with you."
"9089940","9091920"," I'm in some three eighty two C's again."
"9093260","9094800"," I'm at for thirty two cents. "
"9099500","9100800"," Let's see if we can get up in here."
"9108970","9119550"," I want"
"9119550","9120790"," to take it to right about here."
"9173300","9175520"," I'm just trying to throw it right back over again. "
"9198110","9211760"," I'm trying"
"9211760","9212940"," to watch the dome right now."
"9213660","9219560"," I got an eye-voted sticker covering half the fucking dome."
"9246200","9247860"," Let's take a look at the five minute real quick. "
"9251350","9253370"," It's still trying to tee off right here."
"9261230","9262450"," Let's see it right there."
"9264070","9266470"," I need to break above this right here and get bullish. "
"9270990","9272910"," Keep on pushing, baby."
"9274330","9276390"," Keep on pushing."
"9279010","9280550"," Keep on pushing. "
"9287010","9288630"," Keep on pushing."
"9289550","9290390"," Keep on pushing."
"9293080","9294740"," Keep on pushing. "
"9304790","9305890"," Keep on trucking."
"9305890","9307230"," Keep on trucking."
"9308070","9308990"," Keep on trucking. "
"9310490","9316990"," Get off that twenty M.A. Twenty one E.M.A. I think I said it's twenty."
"9318050","9318910"," Come on, baby."
"9319030","9319430"," Get up there. "
"9320770","9322590"," Now up to thirty eight cents in that trade."
"9325310","9327050"," Keep on fucking pushing bulls."
"9340780","9341860"," There you go. "
"9343420","9344720"," You need some thrust."
"9352590","9353410"," Come on, baby."
"9355690","9356670"," Give me some thrust. "
"9357830","9358770"," Give me some conviction."
"9364300","9368100"," Take the fire extinguisher and put the fire in your clothes."
"9377080","9378220"," Keep on pushing. "
"9383760","9385720"," Oh, fuck you, I'm in the forty cents now."
"9389920","9391160"," Just keep on blasting."
"9395170","9399570"," Above the Jedi, above the Jedi, the Jedi E.M.A. now. "
"9400990","9402550"," Oh, yeah, keep on going."
"9404190","9405150"," Keep on going."
"9405310","9406110"," Keep your eyes up here. "
"9408630","9411050"," Keep your eyes on book map right now."
"9411810","9431060"," A little bit"
"9431060","9432140"," of resistance right here."
"9440660","9442740"," This is the zero gamma. "
"9450020","9451360"," Keep on trucking."
"9454100","9456000"," Three, two is now forty five cents."
"9457200","9458340"," It started at thirty two cents. "
"9462420","9464020"," Come on, get up there."
"9464380","9466120"," Fucking get back up there, bulls."
"9469850","9471490"," Keep, yeah, baby. "
"9479820","9480900"," Hold on, lovey."
"9481460","9482260"," How you doing?"
"9485380","9490250"," Keep on blasting, baby."
"9491270","9491650"," Yeah. "
"9491650","9491830"," Yeah."
"9521560","9524460"," Fifty four cents and a thirty two cents call right now."
"9532430","9534030"," Keep on getting up there, bulls. "
"9534330","9535010"," Get up there, bulls."
"9536530","9538270"," It's a hundred percent trade, basically."
"9539930","9541450"," Not about eight percent. "
"9542570","9545610"," Oh, my God, I'm sweating balls off here."
"9552250","9553690"," Keep on cranking, bulls."
"9554030","9554690"," Keep on cranking. "
"9561650","9562970"," Slap that ass up there."
"9567780","9572340"," Sweat my balls off here today, making me work hard on a Tuesday."
"9621730","9622690"," There you go. "
"9622850","9623450"," Keep on pushing."
"9633790","9636650"," I'm about to, I'm about to, I'm about to close right now, so."
"9639330","9643490"," We're at fifty three cents right now, right around fifty three cents, fifty five cents. "
"9661540","9663540"," That's almost a hundred percent trade right there."
"9681630","9683730"," All right, I'm on it, fifty cents right now."
"9684450","9685310"," I'm flat again. "
"9689450","9690750"," That was a good fucking trade."
"9691210","9692650"," This is a great trade right here, is outstanding."
"9696190","9697650"," This is a very good trade. "
"9698390","9700190"," I was sweating my balls off there for a minute."
"9700330","9702910"," I had a fucking, I got caught in a trade right here."
"9703370","9704890"," I lost like ten cents or something. "
"9705850","9708970"," And then I took another trade right here, flat right here."
"9709530","9710470"," I got spooked."
"9710670","9712170"," I got really scared down here. "
"9712290","9713030"," Was it down?"
"9713230","9714350"," I don't know if it was right here, I think."
"9715570","9717670"," And then I picked this trade up right here and this was good."
"9718690","9721650"," I'm a little bit afraid of us not getting up here. "
"9722070","9724510"," We might get up here, but I don't like there's a standing order."
"9729550","9733290"," There's a standing order right where my cursor is right there, a three hundred cell order up there."
"9733410","9737990"," So if we squeeze up here, be, be careful of a, of like this. "
"9738710","9740470"," And then a really fast reversal."
"9743310","9744610"," Could see something like this."
"9744830","9746430"," So just be real careful of that happening. "
"9749700","9751940"," It's like maybe set a cell for like fifty three cents."
"9752140","9754160"," I sold it fifty, but fifty three cents or something."
"9755160","9756340"," If you're, if you're daring. "
"9767330","9768490"," That was a good trade."
"9768610","9769450"," I'm back to happy again."
"9771590","9773650"," But here's, we still have problems though. "
"9773870","9778510"," I mean, there are still problems here like you can't, you can't have, you got to break through"
"9778510","9778990"," these sellers."
"9780310","9783630"," If you're a bull at the end of the day, right?"
"9783910","9784510"," You have to."
"9787080","9791180"," I'm not expecting you to get up here or I'm not expecting you to hold this. "
"9792540","9794760"," I'm not expecting bulls to like hold this."
"9797060","9801060"," But what I'm sure should am expecting for bulls at a bare minimum."
"9802520","9804740"," We talked about this earlier this morning is. "
"9805820","9808540"," You want to at least fail here at some point, right?"
"9808540","9810800"," And consolidate down into the bell."
"9812780","9814660"," The pivot you'd be sideways overnight."
"9815440","9819360"," Maybe we come back down again for more for more buyers down here, but. "
"9820520","9822640"," Like this failure here is bullshit."
"9824060","9825560"," Sorry to swear, but."
"9826260","9827960"," This right here is a scam. "
"9828600","9830940"," This is asking for more bulls to buy."
"9831720","9833780"," It's pretty early the day to be asking bulls."
"9834480","9835900"," To buy this right here. "
"9838560","9840000"," Which we did, but."
"9842700","9846200"," All right, 55 cents, 6.56 cents in that trade right now."
"9846680","9848120"," I'm telling you, take the money up here. "
"9849660","9851940"," Please take the money when we hit this yellow bar."
"9853720","9855060"," We're close to the yellow bar."
"9855200","9856440"," Just take some off the table here. "
"9858300","9859700"," Just take some, take some profit."
"9865280","9866980"," That was a nice fucking trade in here."
"9866980","9867720"," Sorry to swear. "
"9868560","9870040"," There's a kick ass straight in here."
"9873980","9875580"," I took money right here."
"9881070","9882330"," It's fucking market is wild. "
"9882750","9883450"," Buck wild market."
"9885190","9885850"," Buck wild."
"9886210","9886770"," I think I'm Bronco. "
"9898340","9899140"," I didn't."
"9899300","9900020"," I'm not reading your chat."
"9900140","9900920"," I just started reading the chat. "
"9901040","9902140"," I saw Dylan say I didn't mean you."
"9902600","9903460"," I don't know how you guys are talking."
"9903620","9904660"," I guess talking to each other or. "
"9904660","9906600"," Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to chat."
"9906740","9908400"," I'm kind of sweating my balls off over here."
"9915240","9916520"," Talk about some swings. "
"9916960","9917400"," Look at that."
"9918580","9919260"," Oh, yep."
"9919640","9920780"," Right back up. "
"9921300","9923660"," Right back into sellers up here."
"9927280","9928800"," Sellers being pushed back slightly."
"9929700","9937720"," I'm going to turn this yellow bar into a green bar here. "
"9945380","9947560"," These sellers are now up here."
"9952360","9954040"," These sellers are now right there."
"9954420","9956400"," These sellers here are trying to keep up. "
"9956880","9959420"," They're trying to keep the gross yellow too."
"9964140","9966900"," This trade right here saved my ass so bad."
"9967440","9969480"," I can't even tell you how much this trade saved my ass. "
"9973860","9974900"," Saved my ass."
"9977040","9979100"," You guys want to see in the five minute where you are?"
"9981360","9982020"," Just blasting."
"9991680","9994280"," I'll tell you what, bulls just got to reprieve here. "
"9995480","9997740"," Was not looking good for bulls here."
"9999240","10003580"," This was not looking good for down here was not looking good for bulls."
"10006340","10007700"," This was this right here was. "
"10008440","10013260"," If we had broken down here, it would have been a hot, sneaky mess."
"10014580","10016280"," Hot, stinky mess down here."
"10016420","10022080"," This is like skull and crossbones. "
"10025960","10028720"," Bad, bad, juju down there."
"10029820","10032560"," Do not want to see that down there at all."
"10036720","10041200"," Do not want to see that down there. "
"10046580","10047520"," This is bullish though."
"10047520","10051520"," So you got to lower the low of the day."
"10051780","10053620"," You got to lower or a higher low here. "
"10054420","10055680"," So we're getting bullish again."
"10056440","10057680"," See you right there, right?"
"10061420","10063340"," Got the low, got a higher low."
"10065440","10067340"," Bulls need to break through above here. "
"10081190","10082770"," 382s are now 58 cents."
"10082910","10083610"," I'm flat right now."
"10083850","10084910"," I'm not messing with this. "
"10085770","10090130"," I think it was right here."
"10090130","10090590"," I got trapped."
"10090950","10091490"," I'm not positive. "
"10091750","10092450"," I think it was like right here."
"10093270","10094270"," I started breaking below."
"10095850","10096290"," Sold. "
"10096950","10097950"," Blasted down here."
"10098830","10100330"," I picked up some puts down here."
"10100770","10102330"," That shit didn't pan out. "
"10102450","10103370"," Then I'm like, no, I'm cutting this."
"10103470","10103790"," I was scared."
"10104730","10105950"," Started moving up here. "
"10106030","10107870"," I grabbed calls right here."
"10108030","10109750"," Traded it right to this point right here."
"10110510","10112690"," And then the bulls are trying to get above here. "
"10121400","10122960"," You guys want to see a wild day?"
"10125870","10126570"," Look at that."
"10146720","10147780"," Dude, just look at that."
"10153260","10153780"," That's insane. "
"10158860","10160220"," Absolutely insane right there."
"10160400","10160980"," Oh, look at that."
"10161100","10163160"," I got the FMC presser up there still. "
"10163800","10164720"," I got to change that."
"10167340","10168960"," I got to change that presser bullshit."
"10170000","10172340"," I got to have to get the interns working on that. "
"10174860","10179320"," Just looking to the yen as it extends, it gains a dollar yen down as much as four spots, about"
"10179320","10186030"," 6% around 130.58. Saved my ass in here, man."
"10186170","10186910"," This saved me."
"10188530","10191490"," Probably would have been flat on the day if I didn't take this trade. "
"10192010","10192370"," I have to guess."
"10193670","10195270"," It wouldn't have been a big winter day."
"10195390","10195870"," This was big. "
"10196110","10197470"," I want big money in here."
"10198150","10201430"," But then in here I was like 30 cents or 20 cents or some nonsense."
"10202090","10203170"," I think this was a flat trade. "
"10204050","10206950"," But if we had started rolling here, it would have sucked."
"10210210","10211550"," I didn't change the date on my stream."
"10212630","10214270"," I mean, thanks for saying something. "
"10214610","10215490"," I'll change that right now."
"10215730","10216370"," I appreciate that."
"10220540","10222420"," I mean, I'll change the details right now. "
"10224040","10225080"," I appreciate that."
"10240020","10244600"," I probably have the dates wrong and all of these last like, what, five sessions or something."
"10250370","10251550"," Thanks for the heads up on that. "
"10252830","10254570"," Look at Chase dump it again."
"10267680","10268400"," John Haggard."
"10268440","10272380"," He's saying bullish holiday creep needed to sleep off that morning breakfast of champions bear that"
"10272380","10273640"," he washed your chips down with. "
"10274020","10277420"," He's wiped the grease off his sleeve and is ready for some nice that TV statement."
"10277980","10278560"," Red on."
"10278780","10279680"," Red on John Haggard. "
"10281860","10283280"," Mikey's like, it's only 12 11."
"10289210","10291530"," You want to see next resistance on XPI?"
"10293810","10294350"," Hold on."
"10294450","10294950"," I'll get it for you. "
"10294950","10295010"," Yeah."
"10299570","10301030"," It's just my back out here."
"10302670","10304530"," Trying to, trying to work out more. "
"10306530","10309190"," I feel like all kinds of back cracks going on."
"10317780","10318780"," XBI, baby."
"10329740","10331320"," Let's do some XBI for Winky. "
"10341220","10342480"," Oh, yeah."
"10346220","10350540"," Whenever Winky asks for something, we're either at a really big low or a big high."
"10356800","10358920"," Go look at that gap above on XPI. "
"10359940","10360840"," Look at that gap."
"10362720","10365340"," Winky's like big old double bottom over here, triple bottom."
"10365560","10366420"," We got a bottom down here. "
"10366520","10367360"," We got a bottom down here."
"10367440","10367720"," We got a bottom down here."
"10367720","10368540"," We got another bottom. "
"10369120","10375640"," That's what we're looking for."
"10376640","10381180"," Let's have some lines."
"10382160","10384180"," Eighty 12. "
"10397640","10404050"," We've got a A one forty three."
"10405670","10406870"," Oh."
"10424380","10430140"," Oh, oh,"
"10437020","10444360"," man. "
"10458620","10466880"," Come on now, way"
"10466880","10470700"," up there, there's, there's nothing, huh?"
"10503370","10511950"," Right there, there's the S2."
"10553260","10556640"," There you go, take a snapshot of it."
"10561040","10564060"," S3, five minute, very bullish. "
"10567160","10571340"," You'd probably want to see some kind of a, you know, retest here."
"10572800","10573900"," Keep trading higher."
"10577300","10579260"," Could have a moment where it comes back down. "
"10583360","10584080"," One month."
"10587420","10590440"," So you got sellers above here, right?"
"10590880","10591600"," Sellers above here."
"10592100","10592760"," Sellers above here. "
"10593120","10593280"," Sellers."
"10594120","10597160"," Man, it's a pretty, pretty bullish chart right here."
"10610870","10611890"," Price target right here. "
"10613590","10614330"," For the gap."
"10617590","10619630"," You beat this previous low right here."
"10619970","10621490"," You beat this previous low right here. "
"10621610","10622670"," You beat this previous low"
"10622670","10639520"," right here."
"10639520","10640340"," Somewhere in here."
"10641020","10642360"," Previous low, previous low. "
"10643100","10644340"," You got another one over here."
"10648060","10653020"," If you break out above this zone here, you're going to, you're going to make some attempts."
"10655200","10656780"," This is like your real trouble zone. "
"10657180","10659120"," And then above here."
"10660800","10663060"," Got one right in here somewhere."
"10664720","10664940"," Right there. "
"10666320","10668860"," Another one right here."
"10671320","10673480"," If you can get above this yellow box."
"10687620","10688720"," Tracement wise. "
"10700020","10701320"," 60, 78."
"10701800","10703680"," This is 61% right here."
"10704340","10705620"," 50% right here. "
"10707060","10707460"," 61%."
"10709400","10709800"," 78%."
"10709800","10711660"," You know, you're going to get sellers that are three without a doubt. "
"10724270","10725430"," Does that work for you, Winky?"
"10726990","10728350"," Take a snapshot of that if you want."
"10730350","10732130"," 50, 68, 71."
"10748100","10748820"," Give me fast. "
"10751680","10752640"," Are you guys fast?"
"10759100","10761640"," No, definitely did not take the MBI trade yet."
"10768180","10770520"," Did that work for our brother?"
"10773670","10774310"," Right on."
"10777180","10777960"," Appreciate it, Winky. "
"10782040","10784020"," You want to take another snapshot of it?"
"10784300","10786060"," Hold on."
"10786060","10790440"," It's in a US natural gas feature is extending their losses down by around 10%."
"10790440","10792960"," Now, I know recent news catalyst for this move. "
"10803450","10806230"," This is just heads up the yellow is 50%."
"10806230","10810530"," It's also got a gap to fill 61 or 68."
"10811190","10812490"," And then what obviously, yeah, whatever. "
"10812750","10815430"," I think, I think, yeah, this is the 71 and then."
"10816470","10821030"," The thing to consider here, if you take that snapshot or come back and take that snapshot."
"10823950","10825310"," Maybe you can move it up here. "
"10825730","10826470"," CNC S three."
"10845470","10846470"," I'll leave that there."
"10847790","10848930"," And then a five day. "
"10852330","10853390"," Power five minutes."
"10853450","10854110"," Sorry, five day."
"10860070","10864010"," You can see, you know, the EMA over here. "
"10864270","10864390"," So."
"10865510","10872710"," Hold on here."
"10880240","10881820"," You want to stay above the pivot here. "
"10881940","10884800"," No matter what, even if you consolidate down here, you want to stay on pivot."
"10887320","10890340"," Maybe you get out there and then you're up to the to the next taxi."
"10891220","10894300"," You know, fail on our one, come back down for some support. "
"10895000","10898420"," You want to be buying that or buying that for an attack here."
"10899740","10900820"," And then if you extend."
"10903420","10906240"," The only other thing I would say in that is if you hit this, sometimes. "
"10906240","10909830"," Sometimes you will."
"10910010","10911550"," Let's say you trade off here and you hit this."
"10911990","10913290"," This isn't by the day though. "
"10913990","10914850"," Then you'd hit this."
"10917750","10921130"," Then possibly this or yeah, something like that."
"10924120","10925720"," But I don't know if you're getting up here, man. "
"10925960","10927800"," I think I don't think we're at a bottom yet."
"10928000","10928220"," So."
"10931000","10933460"," I don't know if you I don't know if you get that entire. "
"10938400","10940220"," And this SPX is wrong."
"10940640","10942700"," So I'll change XPX for you."
"10944480","10946940"," So SPX for today. "
"10956350","10957730"," So negative gamma."
"10961040","10963520"," This was negative gamma on SPX today."
"10974990","10976990"," This is zero gamma right here. "
"10978110","10990120"," This is"
"10990120","10990900"," positive gamma."
"10991460","10992540"," So if you're looking at SPX."
"10993980","11005510"," All right,"
"11005790","11010430"," sold down, sold down, sold down, came up, threw it right back down. "
"11011930","11012890"," Zero gamma again."
"11013110","11014670"," You know, we want to get that new high, right?"
"11016210","11017330"," There's positive gamma."
"11017570","11018970"," This is where you start trucking actually. "
"11023000","11028600"," I'm going to expect the bears to come in full blast and defend this right here."
"11030160","11034020"," There is something to be said on this though."
"11037230","11039370"," I mean, let's look at where the gap is, right?"
"11040090","11041330"," 396 up here. "
"11043050","11046890"," If you're trading SPX, it's a slower chart."
"11047150","11053720"," It's an easier chart usually to see where the market's at."
"11056740","11059520"," It's the indicator chart for spy. "
"11059880","11060940"," I don't know if you know that or not, but."
"11076180","11077600"," Of course, dip big giant."
"11091490","11092710"," Big giant gap above. "
"11128160","11130040"," You can see the levels right now."
"11133850","11135270"," I've got a, I've got a."
"11136130","11138570"," So, Winky, I've got a."
"11138570","11142190"," A plug-in for levels every day for you guys."
"11143250","11146950"," You'll have that in the, you'll have a, you'll have a bot in the. "
"11148290","11148650"," Discord."
"11149970","11155930"," And on the website for levels every day and on any ticker that you want."
"11161640","11163240"," You should be getting that in the next couple weeks. "
"11163500","11166000"," Hope if the guy can get done with it, you'll have it in the next couple weeks."
"11167380","11168780"," So that's the latest, I think."
"11169040","11170060"," I don't know how long it will take him, but. "
"11171260","11173160"," He's working on a bot for four levels."
"11174400","11179000"," And he's also working on the bot so that you can plug the levels into a trading view chart with"
"11179000","11179740"," pine script to."
"11184040","11188500"," Yeah, you're going to get a bot where in discord, you could just plug in Tesla every day. "
"11188740","11191640"," You know, it'll generate the numbers for you for levels."
"11192000","11193280"," So we're all on the same page on levels."
"11194080","11199900"," And then you'll get, you'll get posted on a captain's alpha, the levels for the major index is. "
"11201560","11207380"," And then on the website, if you just wanted to click on it, you can go to get your levels"
"11207380","11208460"," for the day, get the gamma."
"11208800","11211000"," Hopefully I can get the gamma from most of the major tickers."
"11212540","11214960"," You'll get the distribution of puts and calls in the market. "
"11215740","11216520"," That kind of stuff."
"11219130","11219970"," It's going to be awesome."
"11223010","11224330"," It's going to be, it's going to be fucking awesome. "
"11227470","11228710"," I'm looking forward to it."
"11229770","11231090"," I'm very, I'm looking at the background."
"11231230","11232250"," I'm very excited about it. "
"11236230","11238390"," Yeah, you're going to get to your trading view indicators."
"11238390","11241850"," You're going to get a custom market breath indicator."
"11243090","11244910"," And I'll tell you why I want to talk to you about. "
"11245070","11245970"," I'll talk to you why I don't."
"11246070","11250710"," I do like this market breath indicator, but I don't, I do like it, but I don't like it."
"11250790","11253710"," So I'm having one designed to meet what I want it to be. "
"11260280","11262540"," I'll show you what I want to have happen."
"11269950","11273070"," So I want you to see this on a larger scale here."
"11273290","11275130"," So what I really want for you is. "
"11278590","11281330"," You can see how it has ranges above here."
"11282790","11283970"," When you should be selling."
"11285030","11290210"," I want to like more of like an alert, a little bit lower like yellow and red, but I also"
"11290210","11294830"," want it to like do an email post, like a JSON link to email posts that were getting crispy. "
"11295610","11296430"," And then see down here."
"11296510","11300170"," So you might see how this range doesn't quite go as low as you want it to be."
"11301130","11306490"," Oftentimes you can buy these these lows down here and you kind of barely can see this till this"
"11306490","11307430"," lines up right here. "
"11307970","11310850"," And then I want the indicator to say like, Hey, this is like an inter."
"11311810","11316330"," Like when you're when we're coming up here, like you have like you want to want to have an alert"
"11316330","11317250"," to buy this."
"11318650","11320610"," While we're still in trend, right?"
"11320610","11323830"," So how do you figure out if we're going to stay in trend or not?"
"11325450","11330850"," And then so for like a weekly trade or a daily trade and then when do you know like see"
"11330850","11331170"," right here?"
"11332270","11334930"," Like you can see that you can buy this right here. "
"11334950","11341450"," But if you do buy this, this low right here, it's only good for a defined amount of time, right?"
"11342770","11346750"," And then the real low in the bottom looks like it's right here."
"11348190","11348670"," Right."
"11348730","11349990"," So right here, it looks like below. "
"11351050","11353590"," You probably would have taken profit at this point."
"11354470","11356230"," Then there was another low right here, right?"
"11356910","11358890"," And there's actually another low over here."
"11359830","11361130"," And that didn't show up. "
"11361350","11363090"," Well, it kind of showed up, but not really."
"11363530","11366630"," They were buying this market as it was slammed down."
"11367250","11372470"," So there was consolidation in here as the market was was being slammed down. "
"11373370","11376250"," So there's some work I want done on this indicator."
"11376530","11381970"," So I'm making one for myself that for you guys that you can give you a more clear picture of"
"11381970","11382570"," what's going on."
"11383750","11386910"," And so even just right now, does this look like the bottom on ES?"
"11387530","11388690"," It doesn't, does it?"
"11389810","11392890"," Like you really want to see this get down here. "
"11393130","11397030"," So if you get a holiday rally here, it'll be short-lived."
"11397330","11398870"," Well, this is saying it'll be short-lived."
"11398870","11403930"," So, you know, we could, we could come up here and then I have one other problem with. "
"11405730","11407810"," So let's say we have a retracement rally."
"11409550","11415690"," Not problem, but with this indicator, if we get this deep, right, when does it start becoming a"
"11415690","11420930"," retracement trade and then back down to that zero trade?"
"11422110","11426490"," How do we, how do we tell the difference between, well, right now you can tell the difference."
"11426790","11428190"," This is a retracement trade, right?"
"11430190","11434510"," You can go back historically and it looks like a retracement trade right here, right here. "
"11436110","11439130"," Right here, looks like a retracement trade, right?"
"11439370","11440930"," Retracement trade, kind of a thing."
"11444210","11453130"," So, is this bottom 99 percent, not 99, like 70, 79 or 80 percent, 85 percent chance is not bottom."
"11454550","11456070"," And you get the weekly moving average here, right?"
"11456410","11457950"," So we know we have a date with Destiny down here. "
"11458430","11459450"," They're not done with this."
"11461010","11462590"," And they're not done with this right here."
"11462790","11465410"," They're, they're going to test this again for like high probability. "
"11465710","11469750"," They're going to come down here and try to sell this market down."
"11485460","11488200"," Probably get rid of this one now because we already cleaned that one out."
"11490440","11491920"," Probably get rid of these now. "
"11493560","11494640"," Those are all cleaned out."
"11494760","11498800"," We probably get rid of this one because you broke above it, broke above the high at least."
"11501360","11502720"," So you can get rid of all those. "
"11506060","11508780"," And you can probably get rid of this one because you broke through it."
"11511420","11514920"," We had the lower low earlier this morning, right?"
"11515160","11521460"," We had the broke the previous low right here, but then we got the previous high."
"11522640","11526900"," So the bulls cannot give up this previous high. "
"11526900","11530980"," So this new is higher low."
"11531200","11532680"," The bulls can't give up down here."
"11533000","11537960"," So if the bulls are going to stay in action, they can't go any lower than right there. "
"11541650","11547800"," The bulls must maintain 370, 91."
"11549500","11553180"," We have a lower high now, like lower, higher high, lower high."
"11553440","11553880"," That's not good. "
"11554940","11558440"," So we'll probably start coiling up in here and we'll make a directional move."
"11562140","11563840"," Hopefully you guys sold above here."
"11566570","11569490"," Hopefully you guys took the money and ran double top one, two. "
"11569890","11572390"," I'm going to go back down and recheck this low right here."
"11577070","11578570"," There's going to say this is a double top."
"11578710","11579370"," They're going to sell it down. "
"11587460","11589600"," I'll put it back on the five minute for you."
"11600430","11604150"," Or below the 20 EMA, 21 EMA."
"11620190","11620930"," Tony cheese. "
"11621670","11622590"," Can you feel the short squeeze?"
"11622970","11623250"," I do."
"11623430","11624030"," Maybe I'm up a lip."
"11626340","11628740"," I think they'll punish the early bulls and pumpers. "
"11638980","11640620"," You guys are seeing a huge wedge form."
"11643940","11645840"," Let me see if I see a huge wedge forming."
"11651200","11652100"," I don't know. "
"11653720","11655020"," I don't mind."
"11655360","11657220"," Everybody's like, you guys are drawn."
"11657420","11659420"," People make fun of people that chart. "
"11662180","11663900"," But that's how they used to do it."
"11664460","11666000"," I mean, that's how it was done, right?"
"11666700","11669620"," It used to be done on these paper charts, like huge, like graphs."
"11673640","11675380"," That's how that's how trading was done. "
"11675560","11678860"," I don't know why people give shits to that or make fun of a charting."
"11679420","11682000"," I mean, I'm not a firm believer in charting, but."
"11686860","11690840"," I don't know if it's if it's trading within a zone. "
"11691220","11694380"," I don't mind trading that zone until there's a breakout."
"11695940","11697900"," I don't know why everybody gives shit to that."
"11698120","11699260"," Is this what you're talking about?"
"11699380","11703560"," Is this this this expanding wedge, expanding white megaphone?"
"11703700","11704040"," This expanding. "
"11707920","11710800"," This is the way you're talking about here, maybe?"
"11710940","11711180"," I don't know."
"11711400","11712900"," Let me know in the chat if that's what you're talking about."
"11712900","11713200"," Is this. "
"11715760","11716540"," Boom up."
"11716800","11717260"," Boom down."
"11717580","11717960"," Boom up. "
"11719120","11719640"," Indecision."
"11722620","11724560"," Bulls don't want to give this up though, right here."
"11724860","11725640"," Absolutely not. "
"11726120","11730340"," I don't know exactly what you guys are talking about with the."
"11735160","11737460"," Put fucking 100 fucking different."
"11739800","11740940"," Put 100 different. "
"11776820","11778500"," I don't mind traditional charting."
"11778560","11780120"," I know that people are like, it means nothing."
"11780300","11781780"," I agree with that, but same time. "
"11785480","11787220"," You can see where they teed off up here."
"11787360","11789020"," You can see where they teed off down here."
"11790220","11792200"," And seems like trend is kind of over here, right?"
"11792740","11793460"," You know, trend. "
"11794780","11796940"," Hopefully this sits here and you get one, two, three."
"11803820","11804860"," I'm getting on for that today."
"11808640","11809500"," Let's see if it happens. "
"11816750","11818190"," We already know there's sellers there."
"11818750","11819990"," We already know there's sellers there."
"11821750","11823330"," Right now the sellers are right here. "
"11824090","11824990"," Teed right off here."
"11830250","11831930"," Now they're gone right now, aren't they?"
"11833450","11834570"," On book map, they're gone."
"11838400","11840880"," You know about this one right here, so you don't need this one right here. "
"11841620","11842960"," We know we don't want to break down here."
"11850440","11851800"," So they keep that nice and clean."
"11857990","11859230"," I just cleaned it all up. "
"11861770","11864430"," We'll just do that expanding megaphone pattern."
"11865910","11866730"," Trend is up."
"11867330","11868390"," Trend is being sold down. "
"11868670","11872470"," So one thing you could take away from this is this is coiling, right?"
"11872770","11873790"," This is what coiling looks like."
"11874710","11875670"," You'll get tighter and tighter."
"11876750","11878630"," Usually you'll see a break below or a break higher. "
"11878750","11879970"," It's a good place to put a straddle on."
"11881490","11886270"," You let this coil in here and you can take or a straddle or a strangle."
"11886510","11893230"," Take the 20 cent puts the 20 cent calls and depending on which way it breaks, you cut the one"
"11893230","11897170"," side loose and trade down or trade up the other side to pick a direction. "
"11898550","11899410"," You can see a coiling."
"11907120","11908680"," Did I miss two trend lines in the peaks?"
"11909440","11912240"," You guys want me to just start fucking throwing a bunch of shit on there?"
"11921480","11922240"," Yeah, it's coiling."
"11922600","11923180"," That's what's happening. "
"11923800","11935280"," I can't"
"11935280","11936340"," believe it's almost one o'clock."
"11936480","11938680"," That was a pretty fucking exciting morning, right?"
"11939680","11940620"," That was hot and heavy."
"11940820","11942640"," That was like three or four fast hours of trading. "
"11943120","11944620"," I'm not going to shit you."
"11948530","11951790"," My Machiavelli Adventure saying that we're going down to 373 next two days."
"11952050","11952930"," I think bulls would like that. "
"11954870","11958290"," I think that favors the bulls, not the bears and to be honest with you."
"11963860","11966540"," If we were up at 390, I would say it favors the bears."
"11967860","11969220"," Like 388 or something like that. "
"11969680","11972220"," I'd say this is favoring the bears here, not the bulls."
"11973300","11976380"," If we're down at 373, I'd say it's favoring the bulls, not the bears."
"11983450","11985110"," I'd take that trade all day long. "
"11985430","11991850"," If we tagged 373, I'd probably like, not full port, but you know, I fucking go heavy on it."
"11996760","11998440"," You're back in three, two C's."
"12005120","12006200"," Ooh, that's a nice price. "
"12009320","12010900"," They're expensive right now, man."
"12011060","12011820"," I can't buy those yet."
"12013280","12015280"," You should told me you bought them at 32 cents. "
"12015460","12016280"," I would have jumped in with you."
"12027620","12030240"," If they come back down to 32, I might jump in with you."
"12031060","12031960"," I'll try to help you out. "
"12040250","12041230"," You lucky dog."
"12043010","12046870"," Your, uh, your three, your fourth three, three, two is now 41 cents."
"12047370","12048130"," Good job on that trade. "
"12060550","12062250"," Looking for Warren G, baby."
"12068440","12070020"," Love trading with you guys every day."
"12074380","12075520"," This is a good day. "
"12075520","12077540"," This is like great action right here."
"12078360","12081260"," This felt like this was like this action."
"12081260","12083720"," Just this right here and this and this back up. "
"12084320","12087980"," Was, uh, those some top gun shit."
"12090460","12095840"," There was some like goose and maverick shit right there."
"12109430","12110450"," Pullback sucked. "
"12114070","12115350"," Pullback suck balls."
"12123440","12124740"," The pullback was no fun."
"12125260","12130110"," Oh, they're at 32 cents right now. "
"12130170","12130510"," I see it."
"12134810","12135610"," Hold on here."
"12139210","12140170"," I might join you. "
"12140270","12140850"," Hold on a second."
"12141630","12143150"," Do you want to sell me your calls cheap?"
"12152350","12154710"," Last thing it's go back section was absurd."
"12162550","12163910"," I haven't looked at Tesla today. "
"12164630","12166730"," You guys want to look at Tesla and you want to get Apple too?"
"12170660","12171960"," We can look at both right now."
"12177420","12180840"," I want to take a trade here, but where is we're going to do?"
"12185780","12187300"," We'll get Tesla and then we'll look at Apple."
"12187840","12190020"," Because Apple's got some funky shit going on with it too. "
"12193700","12194580"," Apple's got a."
"12196960","12199280"," Put Apple on today because I want it."
"12199460","12201220"," I put it on the post because."
"12205540","12208300"," I posted that I was going to talk about Apple today because. "
"12209900","12212420"," Apple's got some real sketchy stuff on it right now."
"12215740","12216300"," Excuse me."
"12217080","12218220"," How about this in the background?"
"12218440","12219620"," I'm going to chart out both for you. "
"12220720","12223060"," And then I'm going to pop them up in just a moment here."
"12223060","12225140"," Okay, and we're going to look at both charts."
"12226720","12227200"," And. "
"12233450","12234550"," Give me a second here."
"12234670","12236730"," We'll look at both Tesla."
"12238730","12239670"," And then Apple. "
"12243950","12245830"," We're going to talk about both charts because."
"12247030","12249110"," There's a there's something we have to look at here."
"12253060","12254020"," Specifically Apple. "
"12255320","12257160"," Has some major problems."
"12258540","12259200"," We have to talk about."
"12261580","12262020"," And. "
"12263700","12264840"," Where's where's this one?"
"12265000","12265520"," That's three."
"12268640","12270300"," I'm going to clear this whole chart off."
"12271000","12271800"," Hold on a second here. "
"12272900","12275120"," Well, you know, the Apple chart works still."
"12278740","12279400"," Hold on."
"12279400","12281780"," I'm going to clear the Apple chart and do it start from the beginning. "
"12282540","12283400"," Because I have to."
"12285060","12286420"," We have to talk about Apple."
"12291890","12292450"," What's this?"
"12292750","12294970"," I need to leave the drawings. "
"12296410","12296970"," We know."
"12297770","12298130"," Okay."
"12299590","12301010"," We're going to talk about Apple here. "
"12308330","12310090"," Man, I want to take this trade so bad."
"12310250","12311030"," I know this is going up."
"12311710","12312590"," Most hundred percent positive. "
"12312790","12313650"," This is going up big time."
"12320500","12322020"," I'm very bullish here, by the way."
"12323260","12324460"," On the market in general. "
"12325840","12326780"," I'm extremely bullish here."
"12343240","12345320"," Like explosively bullish on the market right here."
"12352320","12355480"," Hands down monster bullish on the market right now. "
"12357820","12358980"," Couldn't get any more bullish."
"12360100","12361040"," With that said."
"12362600","12364720"," There's a gap in if it's closed. "
"12366520","12367460"," I want to warn."
"12367840","12368540"," I'm just going to make this."
"12368800","12369940"," I'm not even going to chart Apple. "
"12370020","12371240"," I'm just going to be quick with you."
"12371280","12371440"," Okay."
"12371760","12372720"," I'm going to show you something in Apple. "
"12372720","12373020"," Okay."
"12373540","12374820"," I'm going to warn you of something."
"12378440","12387140"," There's a gap above on Apple that's at 142.25. It goes to 143.46. I don't tell you what. "
"12387360","12389040"," You get up there and try to close that gap above."
"12390640","12394300"," And Apple's likely going to start selling really heavy."
"12395540","12397620"," Like new lows kind of shit. "
"12399720","12402300"," So I want you to be aware of that if you're an Apple bull."
"12403260","12404640"," That if you're trying to get out of here."
"12404860","12408580"," This is the warning I gave last last September, last November of like 2021. "
"12416050","12420170"," If at any point Apple trades up to 142 and you're you're like, Hey, Apple stock."
"12420590","12421850"," Take that fucking money and run."
"12431860","12433340"," I don't think it's getting up there. "
"12434280","12436300"," I think it might get up to like 135."
"12437260","12440220"," But if you ever get up there or back up there."
"12442800","12445060"," If Apple ever goes back up there, just run. "
"12452080","12453520"," Run, run, run, run, run."
"12466840","12467500"," Hold on here."
"12486400","12488440"," We're doing some Apple stuff for you right now. "
"12554520","12669520"," 130.73. All"
"12672490","12674250"," right, so I'm going to bring up Apple real quick."
"12686400","12695240"," I don't think that you close the gap, but I don't."
"12704770","12707010"," Yep, there's your 38% right there. "
"12708210","12709630"," Kind of matches up perfect."
"12710610","12711270"," See it?"
"12713730","12715730"," Your 38% is a."
"12717630","12719510"," And your 61% is the gap."
"12723320","12724940"," 61.8% is a gap. "
"12738630","12748100"," I'm going to warn you that whenever this gets hit, if it does get hit, that it's going to get"
"12748100","12748520"," nasty."
"12753050","12754510"," I don't think you get up there."
"12762280","12763940"," I think you come right back down here. "
"12769390","12770970"," Man, you fill this gap right here."
"12801020","12802920"," I think all roads lead down there."
"12803160","12807710"," I think all roads lead down here. "
"12818230","12819230"," Just be really careful."
"12819930","12824710"," I think all roads lead to some kind of a bloodbath down there."
"12841140","12842660"," 120 is way down there. "
"12842660","12844400"," And you're going to get a failure in here."
"12845400","12846900"," I warn you of that right now."
"12847060","12847740"," Okay, I promise you. "
"12848900","12852900"," I promise you that we'll come back to this chart and you're going to see a failure up here."
"12854720","12858660"," When you see that failure, they're going to sell this fucking market so hard."
"12860580","12861920"," You can look at that right now. "
"12863120","12864120"," I promise you."
"12864660","12865520"," It's bullish right now."
"12865760","12868320"," You can see we're bullish on the five minute. "
"12869680","12871480"," You can see we're bullish here."
"12873520","12878860"," But I'm telling you what, man, like whenever they step in, they're just waiting up here for you."
"12888840","12898020"," I'm super mega bullish right now, but I want you to be very careful and I'm going to temper your"
"12898020","12898620"," bullishness. "
"12901740","12902280"," Please."
"12905960","12908940"," Because time passes, I'll just start trading up there."
"12910740","12911740"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"12911940","12912900"," I'm making money right now."
"12913280","12915520"," I'm making some serious fat fucking cash right now."
"12926590","12933610"," I'm sitting on these three to two C's and they're just fucking pumping like green bull blood"
"12933610","12935850"," pumping right now. "
"12939230","12941590"," We're about to rocket ship off right now."
"12944360","12945380"," And I am."
"12945780","12947580"," We are pumping right now. "
"12952460","12954240"," We're pumping, baby."

"12968520","12969740"," I'm pumping right now."
"12971080","12973100"," I'm going to get my arms going right now. "
"12973860","12978340"," Get that pump on right now."
"12980060","12982560"," I'm going to work those biceps right now."
"12983360","12984620"," Get that blood going. "
"12985160","12986440"," Yeah, get that blood going."
"12988880","12994520"," There you go."
"12994520","12996300"," Feel that feel that green pump. "
"12998820","13000320"," Just pumping right now."
"13002200","13003240"," Get it up there."
"13003600","13004560"," There it is. "
"13004860","13005380"," Get it going."
"13006240","13007800"," Get those biceps going."
"13011700","13013380"," Only get the left arm over here. "
"13013440","13015080"," You can't have one side of that arm going."
"13016040","13017420"," Keep pumping it right now."
"13017420","13018180"," Pump it. "
"13023100","13023980"," Get that."
"13024280","13025020"," Get them up there."
"13025400","13028700"," Get up there and get me a new high right now. "
"13029500","13031380"," Just keep on going, baby."

"13051280","13052680"," Christmas time, baby."
"13053580","13068400"," Oh, yeah. "
"13071660","13073200"," Get that pump on."
"13073920","13075860"," I hope you're long right now."
"13081260","13083060"," I'm from Boston, by the way. "
"13084120","13087080"," I'm not a New York Yankee fan anyway."
"13087260","13088920"," Let's go."
"13090560","13091000"," Keep going. "
"13093760","13095420"," So I walked in and I started blasting."
"13096260","13099760"," One of these guys in chat said, hey, follow me along with 32 cent calls."
"13100580","13102120"," Jump in on our three eighty two. "
"13102560","13103960"," Ride that magic carpet cap."
"13104640","13105720"," I was like, I'll get in there with you."
"13105720","13106060"," Let's go. "
"13114230","13114630"," Shwetty."
"13118120","13118680"," Shwetty bulls."
"13123100","13124040"," Thanks, Ryan Morris. "
"13124860","13125800"," I'm in with your brother."
"13129940","13132940"," Oh, fifty eight cents right now on three two C's."
"13133400","13135740"," Fifty nine cents right now on three two C's. "
"13137480","13138100"," Careful here."
"13143180","13145380"," Don't forget we got another top up here, right?"
"13145620","13146940"," Don't forget this level right here."
"13147500","13148940"," Got a couple of little things coming up right here. "
"13148980","13150440"," We got we got what we got."
"13151040","13154460"," We got a tiny little tiny little tiny bedroom right here."
"13155560","13157560"," A little little one right up here. "
"13158880","13159240"," Right there."
"13164470","13165390"," Dude, I felt good."
"13167590","13168950"," Well, I'm gonna do this again for a minute. "
"13169430","13171570"," I'm gonna do it this way through the back of my arms."
"13173150","13174270"," Sorry for a minute here."
"13177710","13179290"," Can I get that blood flowing, man?"
"13179290","13186160"," Get that blood pumping. "
"13198680","13202140"," Coming into some resistance right now we got the block of sellers right here."
"13202220","13203180"," Three hundred twenty two sellers."
"13205040","13206740"," And then above we got weaker sellers. "
"13207560","13209220"," This is a little bit stronger than above."
"13210380","13211360"," Turn that to red."
"13212320","13213260"," Be careful here. "
"13214420","13217100"," This little block right here a little bit stronger than the block above."
"13223280","13224500"," Be careful right in here."
"13226240","13227560"," I think we're going to break through, but. "
"13232220","13233460"," They're pretty bullish right here."
"13237800","13238980"," Yeah, you see that the."
"13240240","13242460"," Week is like, okay, so I buy him a thirty two. "
"13242520","13244520"," I saw him at sixty that I jump back in at thirty two."
"13244580","13245460"," I buy him at some at sixty."
"13261950","13262570"," Rinse repeat. "
"13263070","13264310"," I think we're going up here though."
"13265270","13268650"," There's some other charts that are looking pretty frickin' bullish right now."
"13270850","13273030"," So I think we're gonna blast through this right here. "
"13279320","13279720"," Right?"
"13279940","13283200"," Find a pattern, abuse it till it dies."
"13287660","13288900"," Move on to the next pattern."
"13292440","13294560"," Oh, three to two is that sixty cents. "
"13297140","13298400"," And this is weak up here."
"13298900","13302200"," And I'll tell you what, some other like underlying underlying sectors right now."
"13302400","13303360"," Really bullish right now. "
"13306680","13309820"," Like face ripper rally type of bullish."
"13311500","13313500"," There's our two of a row one above."
"13315260","13316780"," Need to close the day in a high. "
"13317140","13319580"," I'm gonna give a price target of over three to three fifteen right now."
"13319740","13320600"," I think we're going up there."
"13324860","13326580"," Yeah, the charts look great right Omar. "
"13327400","13329200"," The charts look really bullish right here."
"13329860","13330820"," Extremely bullish."
"13337570","13339390"," Don't forget to put stops on your shit. "
"13339630","13340690"," If they roll it right here."
"13341590","13343170"," Don't be like capital all your fault."
"13344090","13346370"," There's no reason you can't take money off the table. "
"13346570","13351530"," Leave a couple runners on or jump back in and stair step this all the way up to R1."
"13370110","13370570"," Yeah."
"13372390","13374090"," Yeah, you need unlimited day trades. "
"13374690","13377170"," If you don't, you're trading just tops and bottoms."
"13377170","13378990"," And we're not at bottom right now."
"13379210","13382950"," Just so you know, if you're out there and you can't take unlimited day trades. "
"13383550","13384750"," We are not at bottom."
"13386270","13388370"," I will, I will tell you when we're at bottom."
"13388790","13390010"," It's easy to, you'll, you'll know. "
"13391190","13395470"," When that, when that market breath gets down to the, to the rock bottom, that's bottom."
"13396170","13401690"," It doesn't matter if the market's going up or down in a trend, negative trend, positive trend for a"
"13401690","13402530"," year long trend."
"13403510","13405310"," You'll know every time we're at a bottom. "
"13410760","13420580"," No matter how bullish today looks, no matter how bullish today looks, we are still in"
"13420580","13422680"," a monthly downtrend."
"13424020","13427240"," So just be conscious like your short term bias is bullish."
"13428140","13433980"," Your medium term bias bias is bearish and your long term bias bias is bearish. "
"13433980","13439140"," And then when we hit bottom, we'll have a short term or medium term bullishness."
"13440200","13444960"," And then we'll, and we will still maintain that long term bearishness until we prove otherwise."
"13450580","13453300"," So Chase is saying be conscious or watch out. "
"13453500","13457120"," This is a very similar to the coily of the day that then eight shit."
"13460670","13461990"," Lots of liquidity still."
"13462130","13463070"," Thanks for the heads up, Chase. "
"13463070","13472700"," It's, it's kind of like weird and, and don't ever hesitate to change your bias"
"13472700","13473220"," either."
"13473420","13477560"," So like if you're like short term bullish, you can change the short term bearish."
"13478280","13482480"," You know, the only thing that matters to you is protecting your money and making money. "
"13483080","13485160"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear out there."
"13485220","13490460"," You always protect your wealth, protect your money, protect your five, give five dollars or protect"
"13490460","13490760"," it."
"13491300","13492960"," You got a thousand dollars are protected. "
"13492960","13496500"," You got a million dollars are protected first and foremost."
"13499020","13503960"," Don't ever like you can have a bearish bias or you can trade better as a bear."
"13504280","13507800"," You can trade better as a bull and you can, you can trade like that, right?"
"13507960","13511700"," If you're like, hey, I trade bears a bear, you can take those trades. "
"13513300","13518460"," But if you're a bear and you trade better as a bear, you have to see when it becomes bearish"
"13518460","13522620"," when it becomes bullish and not like you like fucking it's always like if I'm a bull, I can't be"
"13522620","13526620"," like, this is bullish, this is bullish, this is bullish, this is bullish, this is bullish."
"13527140","13532140"," I have to at least say admit and say, oh, this is bearish, you know, I shouldn't be taking a"
"13532140","13532560"," trade here."
"13534220","13534920"," Does that make sense?"
"13538940","13540300"," So just be like that. "
"13540420","13544140"," Be able to adjust to where the market is going."
"13545220","13546660"," If you don't, that's how you lose your money."
"13547860","13549960"," One of the ways that you lose your money, big way that you lose your money. "
"13560920","13562620"," I've never had a problem trading."
"13563020","13567980"," So I keep different accounts, like I have an account margin account that I trade spreads on and"
"13567980","13574380"," then I've got a cash account that I do day trades on and keep separate accounts for what depending"
"13574380","13574920"," what you're doing."
"13583890","13585210"," None of real buying calls. "
"13585470","13586510"," I think we're just wearing down puts."
"13586830","13588970"," I think there's put selling today is what I see."
"13589430","13590490"," I could be wrong on that. "
"13590490","13596130"," If anyone has a heroin indicator, maybe somebody can ask a spot cam on Twitter say, because the"
"13596130","13597930"," heroin indicator saying this song puts today."
"13600530","13606080"," I think I've got the, I think I've got the market puts from yesterday."
"13606520","13609760"," You're going to look, you're going to compare yesterday's market puts to today's. "
"13610560","13611940"," I haven't checked the PC ratio yesterday."
"13612160","13615220"," The PC ratio was stupid."
"13616740","13618700"," Not stupid, but it was getting there. "
"13619520","13620760"," It was getting to that like."
"13621940","13624120"," It was getting to that like, yeah, no."
"13626020","13630360"," Yes, I'll put call ratio currently is a stands at 0.62 yesterday. "
"13630720","13635680"," It went up to 1.19 and I was like, man, if we go to like 160 or something, we're"
"13635680","13636680"," going to rocket ship up."
"13637000","13638680"," You can't have that many puts in the market."
"13640260","13642640"," So I think they're selling puts right now and buying calls. "
"13642680","13644360"," If I had to guess that's what's happening today."
"13655820","13656960"," Thanks, Jason, the hero."
"13661010","13662030"," So they're not selling. "
"13662670","13664310"," They're not selling puts right now, are they?"
"13665810","13669110"," Yes, CBOE's got the put call ratio at 0.62 currently."
"13671290","13671850"," That's the."
"13678060","13679280"," CBOE is where I got mine from. "
"13695760","13711750"," I still think we"
"13711750","13713530"," get a couple of down days coming up."
"13723540","13724220"," I'd like to see."
"13724680","13725360"," I'd like to see. "
"13725800","13727000"," This is looking bearish, right?"
"13727000","13735680"," In a little bit of a."
"13741650","13742610"," Something like this."
"13745390","13750230"," But then I look at an apple chart and I'm like, yeah, I don't know, like, looks like a bear"
"13750230","13750510"," trap."
"13752070","13753690"," A large time frame. "
"13758230","13759030"," Like there."
"13759290","13760270"," See that down here."
"13771400","13772540"," Check it out a one hour. "
"13774320","13776220"," Yeah, so apple needs to break above."
"13777920","13779340"," Just in a one hour here."
"13780160","13780720"," You guys want to. "
"13780960","13782340"," So on a one hour."
"13784660","13785800"," Let's see it after real quick."
"13786340","13788960"," Do you see when apple trades above this blue line in the hourly?"
"13789220","13790140"," This is a trend, right?"
"13792140","13794080"," So you can see the push above. "
"13795480","13797020"," It's just beautiful move higher."
"13798120","13800860"," So you can kind of see if you're trading below it in the one hour."
"13800860","13803400"," Or above it on the one hour, right?"
"13804580","13807180"," And see we traded below the blue line, right?"
"13807540","13808120"," On the one hour. "
"13808800","13809780"," Just trend, right?"
"13810660","13812900"," So we're talking about now usually with one hour charts."
"13813420","13813960"," I'm pretty decent."
"13816060","13817380"," For what trend is. "
"13819600","13825140"," So if we're looking here on apple, this is constructive here."
"13825320","13828220"," But I want you to see that, right?"
"13828340","13828820"," You want to see."
"13828820","13837240"," If you want to see trend reverse on apple, you'll at least want to see. "
"13838540","13839760"," A trade above."
"13840160","13840660"," What is that?"
"13840940","13842620"," 1 32 53, right?"
"13844200","13846000"," 1 32 53."
"13846960","13853000"," So this is a one hour chart with 21 PM a."
"13854380","13855640"," Twenty one PM a."
"13856840","13859420"," So you want to see that break above, right?"
"13863630","13866370"," You don't want to see like bears just teeing off. "
"13866590","13867430"," You see it, right?"
"13867770","13869050"," That bears teed off there."
"13870670","13872330"," These bears teed off there."
"13872630","13874270"," They're trying to tee off right here, right?"
"13877650","13879570"," This is constructive for the bulls though. "
"13880350","13887170"," So, you know, if you see apple come up here, you take that trade long."
"13888030","13889530"," So someone's saying the bearish right here."
"13889530","13893470"," So I don't blame if we embarrass her at all on that on spy. "
"13894970","13897570"," Let's look at spy on the."
"13900070","13903390"," And you see the fight going on in the hourly, right?"
"13904490","13906090"," This is the hourly on spy."
"13907330","13912710"," And you can see that spies starting to get to trade above here, right?"
"13913650","13915730"," Still has to beat this level here. "
"13917070","13919850"," But you see the fight that's going on right now with spy."
"13924450","13926150"," You guys understand what I'm doing here?"
"13941720","13944940"," Shortly expecting the results of the Fed reverse repo operation."
"14014210","14019550"," 98 counter parties take two sport one, five, nine trillion dollars at the Fed reverse repo"
"14019550","14020370"," operation. "
"14025610","14031990"," So spies trying to get above onto the hourly trend change here, trying to break above here."
"14032450","14036850"," Trade change trend bears trying to push trend back down right now."
"14055960","14057460"," Yeah, I was in that trade too. "
"14057460","14058440"," I just sold out of them."
"14062380","14064020"," I was just in that trade with you, Winky."
"14064180","14068000"," I'm not I'm not telling you guys every time I'm in and out of them. "
"14068580","14071880"," I'm like in and out so fast now that I'm just like fuck this, I'm just going to do it."
"14088930","14090090"," We're about to fucking moon."
"14090270","14090770"," I'll tell you that. "
"14090930","14092970"," If we start breaking above here, it's going to be a blast."
"14094670","14095890"," Trend shift right now."
"14097070","14099350"," Apple's Apple had a huge liquidity grab on it. "
"14110630","14112490"," Definitely don't want to see a reversal here, do you?"
"14116630","14118150"," We were just looking on the hourly chart."
"14118150","14122310"," This is where we change trend change trend."
"14130500","14134440"," If we change trend, this is where it happens right here right now. "
"14142470","14144010"," Here is negative 17 now."
"14144490","14144770"," Yeah."
"14145190","14146950"," So Chase, did you see the hourly charts, bro?"
"14147610","14149490"," I'm going to go back and show you guys right now. "
"14149490","14149730"," Okay."
"14150750","14153030"," So if you're just tuning in, try to pay attention real quick."
"14154170","14155770"," So let's look at Apple real quick, right?"
"14156530","14158210"," Apple had a quick liquidity grab down here. "
"14158210","14159670"," We're going to go to an hourly chart."
"14166500","14168720"," You know, just some consolidation down here."
"14168880","14172380"," You see that you see when trend change is on the hourly, we get a blast off, right?"
"14173180","14174780"," You can see it right down here. "
"14176140","14178120"," If Apple fails, it's not good, right?"
"14179360","14180840"," You want Apple to get above 132?"
"14182460","14183160"," Basically 132."
"14183800","14187640"," Apple has to get above 132 to get a trend change."
"14188920","14195600"," You'll see this blue move and you'll see this move right here. "
"14196100","14196360"," Okay."
"14198120","14203160"," If Apple stays down below, this will move down and will stay below, Apple."
"14203360","14203720"," Does that make sense?"
"14204920","14208020"," Big blue line on an hourly chart. "
"14209780","14214440"," If you look at Spy right now, get real nice and close here."
"14214560","14215840"," You can see they teed off, right?"
"14220470","14224450"," They've just been teed off, teed off, right?"
"14225250","14229790"," Teed off on Spy on the blue line on the hourly trend, right?"
"14230450","14234570"," You can see when we're below the blue line for the downtrend, right?"
"14235630","14238510"," You can see we're above the blue line, we're an uptrend, right?"
"14239650","14240390"," See that?"
"14244650","14249010"," So, let's just take a quick look here on the hourly trend."
"14254760","14258480"," You can kind of see that we're like, it's 50-50 right now, right?"
"14259220","14266120"," So, if we start breaking above this trend here, you'll start seeing a power move up, right?"
"14266400","14266860"," Does that make sense?"
"14322010","14328410"," So, we're kind of in a spot right now with the SP500 where you're either going to get a trend"
"14328410","14332730"," change here or you're going to get a big reversal. "
"14333050","14333750"," It's one of the other here."
"14333750","14334990"," So, it's coiling."
"14335270","14337390"," We're talking about this coiling happen, take taking place. "
"14343450","14350350"," When we talked about either straddling with a position high and a position low, and you take the"
"14350350","14355310"," higher and lower position, if it starts to go against you, cut this side loose or cut this side"
"14355310","14355550"," loose."
"14358570","14359270"," That's the way we break."
"14361150","14363590"," If we trade higher, it's going to be explosive. "
"14363910","14366510"," It's going to be, you're going to start seeing power moves here."
"14367290","14371330"," If we trade lower, you can see trend down to 3-7, 3-0."
"14392260","14393740"," Oh, they're not chopping into clothes. "
"14394500","14395240"," We're making a move."
"14397060","14409280"," Maybe, maybe they'll chop, but we're about to make probably a big move today at"
"14409280","14409700"," some point."
"14432890","14438890"," This is a great place, too. "
"14440010","14442250"," Five day out, OTM calls are puts."
"14442670","14444370"," 20 cent puts, 20 cent calls."
"14446050","14449410"," If we break, it's going to be a big break up. "
"14449670","14457250"," Weeklys will print and either side are going to print huge."
"14458710","14462250"," You could actually buy two-week out calls, two-week out puts that are cheap."
"14464030","14473010"," I don't know what I'm not looking right now, but if you buy 3-7, 3-0s on the downside"
"14474730","14481330"," and 3-90s on the upside or something like that, date them two weeks out or a month out or"
"14481330","14487110"," a week out, I don't know what the delta's are on that stuff, but you can maybe be able to"
"14487110","14490550"," get them closer if they're 20 cents or 40 cents or something. "
"14491430","14500740"," It was a perfect place right now to buy a, not a straddle, but a,"
"14500860","14503180"," what the fuck's the one's called?"
"14512660","14519680"," I don't have that data on this, on this instance of what we're looking for here."
"14524670","14528210"," All you have, all you need to see, all you need to see on Apple is where we are."
"14528210","14533090"," I promise you, if you break above 132, you're off and running. "
"14533490","14534130"," I promise you."
"14544500","14547800"," Now, it's not a collar, it's a, a strangle."
"14609640","14621330"," Yeah, we're"
"14621330","14622390"," definitely coilin' right here. "
"14639470","14641590"," Click till Jade Lizard, baby."
"14641690","14651670"," I like Jade Lizards, moving up now, breaking through previous high, looking"
"14651670","14654650"," to tackle this high above here at 382-14 now."
"14658840","14663360"," Apple's now trading above the hourly 21 EMA. "
"14664080","14665920"," They're above at 132-42."
"14666980","14668720"," Apple's showing signs of trend reversal."
"14672420","14674160"," You guys want to look at Tesla real quick?"
"14687130","14688750"," See if Tesla's joining the party?"
"14689170","14689850"," No, it's not. "
"14691770","14693070"," Tesla's not joining the party."
"14694290","14695570"," This is the hourly on Tesla."
"14698070","14699730"," Tesla has a lot of work to do, right?"
"14703400","14704480"," Can it trade up here?"
"14704700","14704800"," Sure. "
"14706440","14707800"," But it's not joining the party."
"14707800","14708840"," It's not bullish yet."
"14711200","14712400"," It's trading on its own. "
"14717200","14722500"," You can see the bulls are fighting right now to trade, to break above this blue line on Apple."
"14725080","14726380"," There's a bid on Apple."
"14726820","14731900"," It doesn't mean that Tesla can't come back, but Tesla's all on its own right now. "
"14737920","14740320"," Super bullish right now in SPX."
"14752010","14753090"," Spy bullish."
"14760210","14764310"," Let's see the hourly real quick on Spy real quick. "
"14768750","14773090"," Super bullish on Spy right here."
"14774810","14776030"," On the hourly, dude."
"14776590","14777330"," Spy bullish. "
"14785600","14787480"," Tesla not quite joining in."
"14787480","14795720"," That doesn't mean Tesla can't get up a bid here, but they're just hammering Tesla right now, right?"
"14801760","14804620"," Huge concentration of puts on Tesla 160."
"14805680","14808660"," Totally in the money right now for next expiry. "
"14817960","14819860"," This is your pivot right here, right?"
"14821000","14822320"," This is your pivot on."
"14829400","14831400"," So this is your pivot point right here."
"14832220","14834140"," Anything above here is going to be bullish. "
"14837200","14842700"," So this is becoming ultra bullish on the market right now."
"14854020","14855520"," Another buy right here."
"14858330","14860030"," Another big volume spike right here. "
"14873280","14874900"," Some volatility in here."
"14876180","14877340"," Previous high volatility."
"14906260","14907540"," Yeah, me too, Winky. "
"14908880","14909880"," I've sold out."
"14910180","14910940"," I'm flat right now."
"14910940","14916480"," I got in for a brief moment at $0.53 for this trade here, and I was like, I'm paying"
"14916480","14917300"," too much for it. "
"14917360","14918840"," I didn't want to buy it so high up here."
"14920000","14921380"," I'm probably going to miss the trade."
"14921760","14927200"," I jumped in right here, and then it pinged, and I was like, dude, I was like, I should have"
"14927200","14928460"," bought this down here and held it. "
"14928940","14934160"," I bought this, but I sold it here somewhere, and then I bought back in, and I'm like fucking timing"
"14934160","14935820"," on my trade suck right now at this moment."
"14942800","14944940"," And I hate fucking, I hate fucking chasing."
"14963290","14968050"," Yeah, so if you do like a straddle, I don't know if a straddle is the right way, but if"
"14968050","14969570"," we start trading, keep trading higher. "
"14969770","14975110"," If we bring above our one, you cut the put side loose to get up here, and that holds trade"
"14980580","14981160"," and higher now."
"14981680","14999790"," Make it another 10 to 382.14. So"
"14999790","15002850"," we just get rid of this and we'll do a small little line here."
"15006860","15008440"," I'm going to break above this. "
"15020880","15022660"," I think the positioning wasn't right."
"15023080","15027640"," Like in here, I was in this trade, then I got out of it, then I got back in, and"
"15027640","15029100"," I'm like, I have to roll at any point."
"15029180","15030860"," I'm going to get torched. "
"15041670","15042190"," Hell yeah, Nino."
"15045110","15048390"," I'm making good money here, so I'm fairly happy with the day."
"15053420","15056100"," Yeah, I can't say that Tesla's not going to come back right now. "
"15057220","15063540"," Be careful of that big blue line that was up there on that hourly."
"15063920","15068980"," Put the 20 EMA or 21 EMA on a one hour chart on Tesla."
"15075710","15079090"," Trading higher now, big green, big green, five hours down here. "
"15081330","15083630"," Yeah, it's 382 is now 72 cents."
"15087010","15090130"," I should have fucking stayed in the second trade."
"15090290","15090730"," I didn't. "
"15091550","15095510"," And I want to roll over and like dump 40 cents or 30 cents on the trade."
"15095770","15098150"," A little pissed off at myself."
"15110160","15114340"," I say in 3835 SPX again, JPM caller again. "
"15115380","15116380"," Let's look at it."
"15117900","15119120"," Thanks for the heads up, Chase."
"15119480","15121360"," Chase, thanks for always be it on point. "
"15122200","15124220"," You ever coming right to that caller spot, man?"
"15127990","15130010"," This is the JPM caller right here."
"15141320","15145300"," That's JPM caller right with that green line is on SPX."
"15173720","15181080"," Just trying to magnet right back to that 32 16 32 14. "
"15185410","15189530"," I think what what Chase saying is we'll trade down here and then back up to it."
"15191750","15193350"," They already tagged their collar though."
"15193470","15195290"," I wonder if they sold out of their collar or not. "
"15198020","15201480"," I've been told that they hold it to the end regardless of price, right?"
"15202140","15203120"," That's what I've been told."
"15218060","15218700"," Clt 105 P."
"15229890","15232870"," Bulls don't want to have a higher or a lower high on the day."
"15233970","15237890"," Bulls don't want to see the rejection here and the rejection again or even a failure. "
"15239490","15241670"," Bulls want to at least trade above here."
"15242210","15242990"," Hit R1."
"15244430","15247130"," Trying to maintain this at least at a minimum. "
"15247510","15249290"," You have a lot of air."
"15252740","15257440"," They had the lower low today from the previous low on Friday, but you regained."
"15258360","15260420"," This is this was big for bulls right here. "
"15261060","15267620"," The higher low after this bullshit here was big for bulls made it made it can come back up to"
"15267620","15268360"," retest right here."
"15269860","15273540"," Bulls don't want to see a roll over here."
"15274920","15280180"," You end up retesting this level down below here at some point or this one right here. "
"15280260","15283400"," You'll retest this one first and this one second."
"15284140","15285260"," The coil could intensify."
"15291480","15295920"," If bulls want product to be productive, it's the trade above here. "
"15295920","15297400"," At least hold this."
"15297520","15303780"," Even if it sells on the bell, you kind of want to see that move for productive work for the"
"15303780","15303960"," bulls."
"15304280","15312300"," If it doesn't into tomorrow, you want to see these levels hold right. "
"15312520","15317060"," So tomorrow if we trade down, you want to see this guy get bought back up just like it did"
"15317060","15317320"," here."
"15317440","15319240"," Just like it did here and just like it did here."
"15323580","15325620"," You guys already thinking about this in your mind. "
"15325620","15328940"," You should always be having this in your mind what's going to happen."
"15345920","15348000"," New high now, 382 22."
"15351340","15352220"," Good job bulls. "
"15352500","15354280"," I would take some off the table if you're long right now."
"15354340","15355300"," Three two C's."
"15356280","15358020"," Those are now at 89 cents. "
"15358400","15359300"," Doesn't need no trade up here."
"15359420","15360760"," Just take some money off the table."

"15439100","15440880"," Calling you up or anything with craziness."
"15443880","15445700"," There's no pumping and dumping around here."
"15445800","15446900"," We're doing that bullshit either. "
"15449840","15454380"," Well, if you have questions and stuff, feel free to talk inside the chat."
"15454660","15456860"," If you've got we've got traders here with many years experience."
"15457040","15459300"," Traders here with a couple of months experience. "
"15460420","15461820"," So don't feel like you can't say hi."
"15462520","15463980"," I know that some discords get crazy."
"15463980","15467840"," There's like, you know, the secret talking and all that shit and the. "
"15468820","15470120"," You know, shutting people down."
"15470320","15471740"," We don't try not to be that kind of a group."
"15471760","15473540"," So welcome if you're joining us. "
"15477650","15480210"," We don't care if you're a bull or a bear."
"15480370","15481270"," We don't care if it's data gang."
"15481430","15487530"," We don't care if you're trading just ES or just SPX or spy or individual tickers. "
"15488770","15490330"," We're not down with pumpers though, man."
"15490470","15490890"," If you're a pumper."
"15492270","15493950"," We're here to make money in the living and stuff. "
"15493950","15497150"," We're here to we're not we're not here to be a flash in a pan."
"15497330","15500030"," So we're trying to take that side of it seriously."
"15500070","15501530"," If you guys can joke all day long. "
"15502950","15504950"," You can make fun of me and that stuff as long as that."
"15505130","15510470"," And you know, like, you know, you're not just being a complete asshole or something."
"15512330","15514110"," I feel like I'm an asshole to you. "
"15514250","15514950"," Say something to me."
"15515390","15517570"," Say it publicly say it by DM and I'll apologize."
"15518830","15519230"," I'm a human. "
"15519430","15521190"," I make mistakes and make bad trades here live."
"15521410","15522350"," You'll see me make bad trades."
"15537090","15539370"," A little rejection here on the spy. "
"15540670","15543590"," Chase was saying earlier that the JPM caller is up here."
"15544690","15547430"," From my experience, they keep it until the bitter end."
"15548370","15549930"," They don't care if it hits or not. "
"15550250","15554510"," If you guys know that when we're in a bull market, they typically don't nail it."
"15554750","15556430"," Sometimes they do, but not consistently."
"15559210","15563650"," Although the retail traders have been following it so closely now that they're in the same trade,"
"15563950","15564030"," right?"
"15565610","15570330"," Although I think retail traders close their side of that trade once the once we hit. "
"15570550","15575070"," So I would assume that if you're a retailer following the JPM caller, you're not going to hold it"
"15575070","15577190"," into the 30th."
"15577310","15578430"," You should be aware of that too."
"15578510","15579310"," If you're following the J."
"15579430","15586110"," If you're trading the JPM caller, they don't care if it hits and then then it moves away from the"
"15586110","15587070"," caller at expiry. "
"15596970","15603750"," I think I could be wrong on that, but from what I recall, I used to pay more attention to"
"15603750","15604690"," it than I do right now."
"15617310","15618410"," Thanks for the heads up, Chase."
"15624840","15629360"," Yeah, there are trades not that big, but the market following that trade makes it big. "
"15629880","15631600"," Like it's not really that big of a footprint."
"15631600","15637300"," But then everybody fucking takes that trade along with them now."
"15637720","15639440"," That's what makes it a big trade now. "
"15643100","15644680"," No, their trade is not."
"15645120","15645940"," Their trade is small."
"15646200","15654900"," Their trade is like they'd be lucky if it was 3% of the options market lucky. "
"15661730","15663030"," I appreciate it, Grubster."
"15665730","15668090"," The support reasons and weekends, particularly under 30."
"15668570","15670010"," Oh, I'm trying to read what you're saying there, Chase. "
"15670290","15673490"," It's her and then becomes on a move towards 3750."
"15674450","15676990"," We're in hedging positions, flip to a negative game position."
"15677970","15679170"," That feels market volatility versus. "
"15679490","15679570"," Yeah."
"15680250","15680950"," So right here."
"15681150","15682050"," Do you see this down here?"
"15684090","15686050"," Just negative gamma that I've got down here. "
"15686570","15687930"," It's right here."
"15688210","15689550"," It's 37 758."
"15691550","15692890"," It's not 3750. "
"15693050","15694590"," It's 37 758."
"15694590","15695710"," Spot gamma is wrong."
"15700310","15700750"," 3800. "
"15700930","15703630"," It's like you're bouncing on a trampoline at 3750."
"15703770","15703790"," Yeah."
"15704090","15706610"," So right here, right?"
"15707030","15708630"," Well, 383 right here. "
"15709230","15711930"," This is where you get super positive gamma."
"15712290","15713970"," Let's get this closer right there."
"15718290","15719290"," Yeah, I agree with that to accept. "
"15719930","15721210"," We'll put that down there for you."
"15722730","15726870"," I agree to that within, you know, within horseshoes and aggregates what they're saying."
"15728230","15728670"," 100%. "
"15731990","15733910"," So impulse, trampoline, brownie, the bid bounce."
"15734550","15735270"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"15736170","15737910"," Grubster, thanks for supporting the channel, man. "
"15738010","15738770"," I appreciate that, brother."
"15739430","15740570"," I hope this is helping you."
"15743450","15746970"," That doesn't mean you can't trade on your own or trade, you know, that you're a better trader or"
"15746970","15747490"," worse trader. "
"15748130","15748990"," This is nice to have somebody."
"15749610","15751410"," It's always nice to have somebody around with you, right?"
"15755480","15756520"," I don't like trading alone."
"15756740","15760440"," I like listening to somebody else talking while they're trading, having them in the background. "
"15762910","15768350"," I used to listen to, um, I used to listen to the guy on a thinker, or think or swim."
"15769450","15771170"," I used to listen to that guy in the morning."
"15771170","15774090"," He used to be on from like 9 30 to 11 a.m. or something. "
"15775990","15777550"," I used to like having somebody next to me."
"15778950","15782610"," You're like, that guy always, that guy didn't always take a lot of trades, but I like to have them"
"15782610","15783370"," talking in the background."
"15787500","15793060"," So kid time saying maybe a nasty double time commission says recapitalization aid will prevent"
"15793060","15798420"," insolvency of Uniper, which would have serious consequences for the German gas market. "
"15799700","15801300"," One top two tops."
"15816610","15817890"," Talk about selling it down."
"15817890","15824270"," And 6.3 billion euros in German measure to recapitalize energy company S E F E."
"15825210","15826910"," First target right here. "
"15828110","15829790"," Second target right there."
"15834650","15837310"," This is trend trend."
"15844990","15845750"," One. "
"15846370","15846990"," Two."
"15851160","15852760"," If we break trend."
"15853840","15855240"," You know what that means, right?"
"15859120","15870220"," If you break trend, you know what that means, we're seeking where the lower lows are here, right?"
"15870420","15874000"," You're seeking out this one, if you break trend, you're seeking out this one, if you break trend,"
"15874340","15876480"," seeking out this one, if you break trend. "
"15904220","15906620"," So if you get in bearish here, what are you looking for, right?"
"15906820","15907780"," You're looking for a trend break."
"15909860","15912660"," This is your big, this is your big yellow line to break."
"15930840","15933580"," Your targets below are going to be 380. "
"15935200","15938100"," 370, 87, 370, 75."
"15962340","15965980"," You saw back here, we threw it over right here, right?"
"15966260","15970060"," Remember we were in here on the one minute chart, it was all just messy in there, just bloodbath"
"15970060","15970780"," down, right?"
"15972220","15974320"," So they're going to attempt this again, right?"
"15974840","15977060"," Come down here, try to bloodbath this down."
"15978360","15979540"," Then bloodbath this down. "
"15980780","15986420"," Break there, break there, and a breakdown here, just level level, so be careful of this."
"15994780","15996040"," A little quick reversal."
"16036000","16038920"," It's actually a really good trading day, an outstanding"
"16043170","16075360"," trading day. "
"16076660","16079580"," This is a very fast day, a very good trading day."
"16086090","16089610"," I like days like today more than I liked FOMC."
"16090010","16092330"," FOMC sucked, that whole week leading up to it. "
"16092710","16099630"," I wasn't happy with FOMC like trading that day, I wasn't happy with CPI, all that shit."
"16099810","16101310"," I didn't trade CPI day itself."
"16104970","16108850"," I went partying with some fin twitters. "
"16111830","16119790"," I'm not going to name any names, but that's how I think they do that intentionally."
"16119970","16121110"," If you're like, hey, you know what, it's CPI."
"16121130","16124550"," Let's go get Captain Jim James and get them all messed up at night time. "
"16125210","16128510"," CPI shows up drunk downstream on CPI day."
"16131250","16132670"," I was like, I didn't have none of that."
"16143950","16153910"," So most of the US flag owners CPI, but most of these"
"16153910","16156110"," events, you go into them and they're one-sided. "
"16156410","16160510"," You'll see lopsided puts or lopsided calls."
"16161490","16169730"," This year specifically, the dealers had built up both sides, so it wasn't worth trading."
"16170570","16174310"," You had like zero dates that were costing three, four, five, six dollars and shit. "
"16174410","16176290"," It wasn't worth whatever happened."
"16177510","16180730"," Matter of fact, FOMC, they erased both sides."
"16182010","16183630"," And CPI they erased both sides. "
"16183810","16187650"," It was really, and we had like a reversion to mean the whole entire week."
"16187910","16194810"," Anytime we traded every legit setup for follow through, reverted back to a mean."
"16196490","16201130"," So we were like, what some guys are chasing, like one close we had was this engulfing candle. "
"16201430","16203510"," I was like, oh man, that's going to print huge tomorrow."
"16204630","16207110"," And it just came right back by the next open."
"16207970","16212730"," And then there was like a rip higher and it got sold off, reverted right straight back. "
"16213030","16213470"," It was horrible."
"16215550","16215990"," Horrible."
"16216690","16220010"," Those two, those like week or two weeks leading up, I was not happy. "
"16220010","16225670"," Like every setup was this should print and it wouldn't print."
"16226130","16227390"," It would just go just to a point."
"16228010","16229190"," They'd sell right into it. "
"16229250","16230310"," We'd go down, right?"
"16230590","16232850"," And they'd just buy right into it."
"16233790","16234710"," And it was just horrible."
"16235770","16238450"," It was probably the worst trading of the year. "
"16240290","16242830"," Not in terms of like, did you make money or not?"
"16242950","16247490"," We made money, but it was in terms of it was almost untradable."
"16249070","16253270"," If you are an account that you have, what is it, PDT, PDT's or."
"16254810","16256410"," I forgot the other one is called, but. "
"16258610","16263410"," We, if you, if you only want to take one month trades or three month trades or something, we do"
"16263410","16264090"," that here too."
"16264730","16266090"," We're coming into one soon."
"16266830","16269630"," We're in the middle of a hopefully a retracement. "
"16270790","16276790"," But we're not done seeing the bottom of this downtrend for the next month or two."
"16279920","16281880"," And the market's still going down overall."
"16282200","16282280"," So. "
"16283680","16284820"," The longer timeframe."
"16285740","16287320"," This is inconsequential too."
"16289780","16294120"," So I want you to have your face on or I want you to have your face on for if"
"16294120","16295060"," we do trade higher. "
"16295640","16300580"," If we do at some point hit like three eighty three three ninety three eighty eight, whatever that"
"16300580","16300840"," is."
"16301700","16305340"," If you start hearing bulls say things like, oh, we're going to four thousand."
"16307420","16309540"," We're going above the gap or some shit like that. "
"16309980","16312180"," You need to like switch to bearish at that point."
"16313880","16315720"," If we trade down to three seventy three."
"16316640","16319120"," Get that, get that retracement face on again. "
"16328780","16329220"," Boring."
"16332440","16333960"," No, I haven't touched them yet."
"16334100","16334300"," Hold on. "
"16334420","16338240"," Now they're at fifty cents right now, man."
"16338480","16340280"," They're not giving, they're not paying the juice on them."
"16340280","16343000"," I don't know what's up, man. "
"16344360","16345740"," I don't like them at fifty cents."
"16345820","16348600"," See, when you watch them all day long, you're like, yeah, I don't want to pay fifty cents."
"16348740","16350140"," I want to pay thirty two cents for them again. "
"16351140","16353320"," It's like built in premium now on those things."
"16359340","16363540"," I want you to sell the media like twenty eight cents twenty cents."
"16373670","16378390"," When you watch them all day long, you're like, yeah, they're still a little pricey. "
"16378390","16380850"," There's someone sitting in those that wants to get rid of them."
"16383400","16386259"," There's some guy out there that's like, hey, man, buy my bags."
"16388220","16389980"," There's plenty of left room left in it. "
"16393180","16394720"," I'm like, yeah, I don't know, man."
"16394900","16395820"," I know you bought them at twenty."
"16396099","16397759"," I know you bought them at thirty two cents. "
"16398080","16399540"," How much to give them to me for twenty eight cents?"
"16400500","16401180"," Twenty four cents."
"16404380","16406460"," I wonder if I put a bid in right now."
"16406460","16409180"," I would fill at twenty twenty eight cents or thirty two cents. "
"16411360","16412599"," You guys ever done that shit?"
"16413759","16416020"," Puts think bids in and see if there's a standing order."
"16419869","16420890"," I've done that shit."
"16421070","16421630"," You don't need to do. "
"16422150","16424029"," We used to trade like stocks and stuff."
"16424930","16431250"," I'd go like fire out in like a month or not about like three, six, nine months, twelve months out"
"16431250","16432430"," and find like a block of."
"16433730","16438610"," Just like a block of like like five hundred options out there. "
"16438669","16439470"," Someone bought or whatever."
"16440169","16443230"," I'd try to like in like slow days."
"16443470","16445250"," I just try to like find out if they've got a."
"16447009","16448169"," A low sell on it. "
"16449110","16451710"," See if it feel like a stink bed."
"16460330","16462250"," Oh, yeah, you leave a standing order down there."
"16463090","16465050"," I need to put one in it like ninety six. "
"16465970","16467349"," I don't have one in right now."
"16467349","16470529"," I need to put one in so if it gets filled at like four a.m. or something."
"16476210","16477669"," I have to write that down. "
"16480150","16481430"," Because I have not done that yet."
"16490680","16491960"," Let's put an order in down there."
"16495980","16500779"," Just see if it ever fills one morning at like four a.m. I have alerts for it. "
"16510080","16511279"," But you do that all the time."
"16512419","16513560"," You have done that before."
"16513820","16515380"," I don't do it anymore, but I used to do it. "
"16516460","16519400"," I used to go around and just I find like high concentrations."
"16520619","16524140"," Of calls and shit out in the middle of nowhere like nine months out and be like."
"16524720","16526200"," Let me try like five dollars. "
"16526520","16528160"," Let me try like four dollars less."
"16528419","16531040"," Let me try three dollars less and see if I catch a fill."
"16534140","16536500"," Because there it has to be like a low. "
"16537400","16538380"," It has to be like a low."
"16538640","16539900"," It has to be like a low like a like a not a low photo."
"16541900","16542560"," It's a call. "
"16542759","16543259"," I'm having a brand."
"16543619","16545660"," I'm having like brain problems this morning."
"16546640","16548580"," A low like a low liquidity environment. "
"16551119","16552660"," And sometimes you'll get a fill."
"16553860","16557880"," Typically it's like a lot of liquidity and people buying and so on."

"21343230","21345590"," Then you have real money buying and real money selling. "
"21346490","21350430"," So if you get any of that right you get that combined with short covering."
"21352410","21356170"," You start squeezing short stuff like that's how you get moves in the market that are unexpected."
"21356170","21358130"," So just be conscious of that. "

"21640610","21641910"," It's just not worth it. "
"21643590","21647810"," We're at zero gamma right now we could trade this sideways overnight where it's at right now."
"21648370","21651250"," You get pinned straight across in the overnight right now."
"21651870","21656630"," If we close here at three eighty is a fat chance that we're opening flat tomorrow. "
"21663330","21663830"," Yeah."

"21684110","21687870"," Right where we are there's a trade that's a straddle for a."
"21689350","21691670"," Not a straddle but a."
"21692030","21692970"," A strangle. "
"21693930","21697030"," So you buy like an outside the money call outside money put for real cheap."
"21697930","21700450"," And you cut the other side loose or chase the one side."
"21701010","21704650"," There's another trade here where you could buy I was thinking about this one this morning where you"
"21704650","21707090"," could buy a like a call spread. "
"21708590","21710430"," Maybe you get it to expire on Friday."
"21711830","21713630"," And then you buy really cheap puts."
"21716070","21718410"," And then you'd have to manage the call spread. "
"21718790","21723050"," You cut the call side if you start trading lower and then just max out on the on the puts"
"21723050","21725070"," and just credit like lean into it."
"21725490","21729510"," Take the loss not the full loss but some of the loss on the call side of the call spread."
"21730150","21733110"," There's a couple ways to there's two or three different ways to capture this. "
"21735730","21736610"," Into Friday."
"21737630","21740230"," I'm not going to talk about butterflies and condors right now here."
"21741450","21742810"," That's a simple way to do it. "
"21743390","21745170"," Are two simple ways to do it."
"21749710","21753830"," You know they were looking for news to sell they'll look for news tonight to sell to any anything"
"21753830","21755490"," that they can find to sell they will."
"21756810","21759090"," It just gives bullshit news to. "
"21760330","21764370"," If we if it was really bad last night with Japan news we would have been down 5% in"
"21764370","21764650"," the overnight."
"21764650","21770750"," I like flies man."
"21771030","21772330"," Just do it wider fly. "
"21773730","21774650"," They manage it."
"21774990","21777210"," I'm not into those trades anymore used to be but I'm not anymore."
"21777890","21778710"," Sometimes it will. "
"21779230","21782710"," I like to do personally like to do butterflies on shit that goes sideways all the time."
"21783130","21784090"," They were they work on spy."
"21784690","21786330"," If you know you're going to be sideways for a few days. "
"21787730","21789550"," Now we're in a trend reversal right now so."
"21790610","21792110"," I think the strangle is better."
"21792110","21793610"," So in a one more time frame. "
"21795350","21797490"," One of our time frame this market is."
"21798350","21801570"," You know right on the edge of a trend reversal so."
"21802910","21804590"," I would I would tell you that. "
"21806050","21807850"," You're you're it's very risky."
"21808430","21811590"," Doing a butterfly or a condor here."
"21813830","21814810"," It's not the trade. "
"21815270","21821030"," So right here you can see right on it right on it on a consolidation or distribution to make a"
"21821030","21821890"," move lower or higher."
"21821890","21824750"," So I think you're going to see that move before Friday."
"21826010","21829010"," You're going to see a bloodbath into Friday or you're going to see a."
"21830410","21832430"," A move a much a move higher. "
"21832430","21833690"," You can even see both sides."
"21834730","21838770"," So the butterfly might be better for you but you can see a move down here and then a slam"
"21838770","21839690"," up to close that."
"21840830","21844430"," So if you did a butterfly would have to be you know way out here and way down here. "
"21846270","21847370"," The capture all that."
"21848610","21851850"," You can bunch of ways you can express this move if this happens."
"21855230","21857450"," That's what I think it is something like that. "
"21857610","21859110"," Now if it starts to gap up here."
"21860210","21864270"," I'm going to expect this move down or or this tag and then we maybe we sell."
"21864550","21867310"," I mean that's the Christmas rally right to start cranking. "
"21868630","21872210"," Slamming a ninety six on Friday Wednesday Thursday Friday."
"21873250","21875530"," They come back on Monday and they sell this shit down."
"21875530","21876830"," Yeah I can see that too. "
"21877650","21882490"," That still works with the with the with the call spread and some dirt cheap OTM but."
"21883250","21886190"," That still captures that trade or you day trade at each day."
"21886770","21889270"," And you don't care which way it goes if it goes up it goes down. "
"21898510","21900130"," You need a big green can of test there."
"21910390","21914610"," You know you didn't have six weeks of balance above man."
