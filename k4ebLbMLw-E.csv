"k4ebLbMLw-E","2290980","2297380"," It's a fucking lie. They will ride that shit as long as they possibly can. The hand of manipulation"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2305700","2312180"," of that shit. We see you see it time and again. It's why oftentimes companies fail, right?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2313060","2318420"," It's it's that it's that ego and id in the background that all consuming"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2337460","2341300"," And maybe you guys disagree with that. But some of you have probably experienced this"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2415940","2421540"," I said he or she, right? He had all of his metrics for the year. And then two competitors"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2468500","2472100"," That CEO saw what he was going to get paid. And he was literally like,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2473060","2478980"," that guy ain't getting that fucking money. There's no way that sales person is making as much as me."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2478980","2487860"," It came down to that one moment. And I mean, that, the person that happened to,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2487860","2493940"," I would be, I would be completely devastated if that happened to me. That's something that"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2499940","2505460"," that kind of shit. They do it all the time. They're monsters, evil monsters."

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2552980","2557940"," Yeah, it really was. It was that you can't make more than me. I shit you not. That's, that was it."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2557940","2563780"," That was the reason you can't make more than me. That was the reason."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2567860","2569380"," That's what it was. I kid you not."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2572100","2576340"," There's a guy I used to work for that used to do that, uh, not on that scale, but"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2576980","2581540"," I used to work for a guy a long time ago and he was just like, fuck that. These people make more"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2581540","2588740"," than me. But these guys were all, uh, all their incomes were based on, uh, sales. So, um,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2589860","2592660"," they were making a lot of money. They were making more money than the, uh, well, they were making"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2592660","2596980"," more money than the owner for the time they were putting in. Uh, they were only working like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2597940","2602900"," six to nine months a year and they were making mid six, or not mid, shouldn't say mid six figures,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2602900","2610660"," mid mid, uh, 150,000 a year, 120,000 a year. They were working like six to nine months out of the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2610660","2613700"," year. They'd have a three months paid vacation."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2616420","2621940"," This is better than it being a teacher, but he was always angry too. He'd always, he'd be"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2621940","2625380"," storming around. He'd be like, how do we get this money away from these people? And I'm like,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2625380","2628660"," I don't know if you do that. If you do that, you're going to lose all these people. These are"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2628660","2633300"," people that make you millions. Uh, you've got the best people out you could. You, you, like,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2633300","2639300"," this guy had like taken people from other industries, uh, that because the wage was so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2639300","2644500"," competitive, right? The pay was, you know, 120, 150 k a year. You knew what you were doing."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2644500","2650420"," It was a pretty good, pretty good job. You worked like maybe four hours, six hours a day,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2651460","2657540"," uh, five days a week. So what is that? Uh, 20 hours, maybe 30. And then you got three months off"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2657540","2662580"," paid vacation. And so he was always trying to figure out ways to keep money. I can shit,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2662580","2667780"," you're not like keep money from these people. And, uh, it was bizarre because it's like,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2667780","2674820"," you realize if you, if these people start making 50,000 or 40,000, you're going,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2674820","2679700"," they're going to quit and you're going to be left with, uh, someone that's unqualified,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2681540","2683860"," for what you're asking them to actually bring to you."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2686980","2690420"," This point was, we'll just throw more at it. I'm like, no, that's not how it works."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2690420","2698980"," We'll just throw more people at it. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. One minute remaining."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2700660","2701780"," That's not how it works."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2701780","2721220"," Let's see what's going on down here. We're going to go down to the SPX one minute chart here and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2721220","2728100"," just check this out really quick. Go to SPX one minute. Let's have a look see on this. We've"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2728180","2734020"," got a confirmation bounce down below on the hourly trigger or excuse me on the lower support here."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2734740","2740500"," So this green line right here is lower support. This is at 5080. Looks like it wants to come up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2740500","2746420"," here and trade it again. So if you're going to try to take this out right here, I'm still looking"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2746420","2751700"," for some more downside though, but take a look at this one right in here, a little bit of a squeeze"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2751700","2760100"," job coming up. Look for a target to the upside of 5090."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2760100","2766260"," Draw 96 BCF lower than the forecasted draw of 85 BCF."

"k4ebLbMLw-E","2947540","2953460"," joins us now. So the year over year number went down, that's good to see. Though the monthly rate,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2953460","2961060"," which we highlighted earlier, especially on 4, up 0.4 percent and a 0.6 percent rise in services,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2961860","2967140"," how worried is that going to be for the Fed? It was exactly what they are concerned about and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2967140","2973220"," why they are not rushing to cut rates. Certainly we have seen the inflation come down from its"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2973220","2979940"," peak quite rapidly, but to continue to move down is going to be tough, particularly because wages"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2979940","2984660"," are not moving down nearly as rapidly. They have been around 4 percent. The budget speaks to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2984660","2990420"," report. It says a is-reled mark, 6-5, it's going to be around 4 percent. That's one of the largest"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2990420","2996820"," costs that firms face, and particularly firms focusing on the services rather than manufacturing."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","2996820","3003700"," So it's going to be a slow decline. The Fed is not going to move too quickly. June is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3003700","3007380"," possible, but this is one of the reasons why they want to see more data."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3007380","3012100"," Do you want to say up-to-date the latest and wages are leaving down for the low-power payrolls?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3012100","3016580"," That's not up-to-date and gives us a special offer. What is your sense we were talking about earlier"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3016580","3020980"," about? This is what's happening in January. There appears to be some sort of acceleration,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3020980","3026900"," not just in prices, in parts of spending, manufacturing numbers turning up, and some of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3026900","3033140"," the other weaker parts of the economy. Do you think January is unique or is it telling us"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3033140","3039060"," something about the rest of the year? It's hard to tell from one number whether it is the unique"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3039060","3045700"," or something on a trend, and so that's why the Fed is going to wait to see. I think you can't"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3045700","3049620"," over-interpret any one number, but you can come up with a number of factors that come in."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3050660","3056500"," We're seeing a little bit more weakness in some areas of spending, but we also saw a very generous"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3056500","3061220"," increase in Social Security payments, so I think that's going to be have to work out over the next"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3061220","3065540"," few months. But I think this is precisely why the Fed ain't moving. Obviously, they're not moving"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3065540","3073460"," now. I think it's unlikely that they move in May. If things continue to move down and see more"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3073460","3078100"," signs of labor market weakness, they're then likely to move in June, but I wouldn't even say"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3078100","3083700"," June is baked into the cake. What's your guess right now? Three cuts this year? Do you think they'll"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3083700","3091380"," be able to do that? Broadly, that seems reasonable based on their forecast and based on the way the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3091380","3097700"," economy is likely to evolve, but we've been in a really fortunate situation of having this very"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3097700","3103940"," soft landing. I'm still a little skeptical that we can get there with no pain, and if there's a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3103940","3108980"," little bit of pain, then the Fed's going to have to move a little bit more. You mean economic pain?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3108980","3116180"," You mean labor market? Yes. Yeah, exactly. I think it hasn't really materialized yet. Not at all."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3116980","3122580"," Now, I think one of the reasons for that is that even the Fed raised interest rates really rapidly."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3123380","3131060"," Still, inflation was quite hot, moved up even more rapidly, and wage rates moved up very rapidly."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3131940","3137220"," So, you're starting to see them move up, not quite as much as inflation. Now, inflation has come down."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3137940","3142980"," Interest rates, real interest rates, inflation adjusted interest rates are now positive. I don't"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3142980","3150180"," have been so for about six months. Real wage rates, growth rates are now positive. They've only been"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3150260","3153700"," positive for about six months or so. I think firms are going to be less"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3153700","3158820"," sanguine about hiring now that they have to pay a positive real wage. I mean, it's great for"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3158820","3164580"," households. Not as exciting for firms to be hiring, and real interest rates have become positive"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3164580","3170980"," really for the first time in decade or so. I think that is going to be kind of a one-two punch,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3170980","3175060"," which will slow the economy down, probably not necessarily leading to the Fed."

"k4ebLbMLw-E","3447540","3452500"," picked the best mechanisms to combine, so even if some of the competitors succeed, we're still"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3452500","3458100"," going to be a successful company. And we're just beginning to see the drug's potential and"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","3463860","3470900"," obesity. Was there sort of a light bulb moment when you thought, wow, this could be a game-changer"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3470900","3476020"," in terms of how we treat obesity? When we started to see the data come out with the profound weight"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3476020","3481620"," loss, and in the more recent studies showing reductions in cardiovascular risk, I think we"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3481620","3486820"," probably will unmask more safety issues. My hope is they're not profound, that they're predictable,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3486820","3487940"," but time will tell."

"k4ebLbMLw-E","3516260","3520020"," And just recently, they're saying that maybe we should think about a molecule that is more"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3520020","3524020"," vaccine-like. They're thinking about something that could be a once a year injection instead of a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3524020","3530340"," once a week injection. So they're already at work thinking about the next sort of iteration"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3530340","3535380"," of this class of drugs. Is an oral going to be the next, I mean, just being able to take it obviously"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3535380","3539460"," in a different way than having to inject yourself? So there's a lot of studies going on for oral"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3539460","3544180"," formulation. So limitation, though, for an oral formulation is that you typically have to take"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3544180","3549860"," it within a certain number of hours of eating. And so as opposed to giving it, giving it weekly,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3549860","3553940"," you have to think about when you're taking it in the course of the day. And that may be trickier"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3553940","3558660"," for people to comply with. What did you learn about whether they can use us in kids? Because"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","3574020","3578500"," including medication and surgery. And for these kids, you think, oh, kids are just overweight."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3579300","3583780"," No, they're pre-diabetic. They're taking heart medication. These are people with the"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","3594020","3599460"," bariatric surgery was the only other option. This could be another option. But there is one big"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3599460","3603860"," caveat and that is trial data is only available for one year in this age. So you wonder about the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3603860","3608980"," long term we don't know. We wonder about the access and the who's paying for all of it. And in the"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","3615300","3618820"," Just a heads up really quick in the background. If you're wondering what I'm doing,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3619540","3627700"," we've got trader podcast coming on the show here around 11 a.m. I have some work I have"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3627700","3633300"," to do in the background and make that happen. So here we put my, so you guys can hear me,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3633300","3641700"," let me get rid of this picture really quick. Old man, braggy time. Okay, so just a heads up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3641700","3649220"," with you out there right now. And we are going to have trainer podcast on the show"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3650340","3656580"," at 11 a.m. So he asked me, what are your thoughts on the market? I said, I think we're going to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3656580","3663620"," 5.25, 5.35 somewhere in there. He said, are you sure? And I said, Nope. I said, I like the idea of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3664500","3671940"," of that move up higher, even if we have cell downs, that the target is 5.25, 5.35 key"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3673780","3679540"," is similar in that thesis, but he's got some important information about that thesis"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3679540","3685780"," that you guys need to hear this morning. So we're going to have him on unless something changes,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3685780","3689620"," right? That's the thesis that we're going to continue to go higher. We need some major changes"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3689620","3694660"," like we're breaking underneath the hourly trigger. We're blasting down to the daily,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3694660","3699540"," we're then rejecting the hourly to get below the daily to get down to a correction type event"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3699540","3705300"," until that happens. He's wants to discuss the timing of that with you this morning. So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3705300","3709940"," give me a few minutes to set that up. A trader podcast will be on the show here in just a few"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3710020","3714020"," moments."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3720820","3725780"," Drugs of all time, but does it even go beyond sort of what people may be seeing right now?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3727220","3731700"," Yeah, I mean, I think we're kind of like, we're in the very early chapters of this,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3731700","3736900"," of this novel, so to speak. You know, the zep bound from Lily was just approved"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3737700","3744180"," towards the end of last year. And, you know, we go V and Manjaro have basically been"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3744740","3751300"," obesity centric drugs for what a year and a half, two years now. So we're really not even"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3751300","3756900"," scratching the surface. And the demand is so insane. I mean, every other person I know"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3756900","3763540"," is taking one of these drugs. The demand is so insane that you've seen Novo Nordisk and Lily"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3763540","3769780"," invest billions into manufacturing. So yeah, I think we're in the very early stages."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3769780","3776660"," We talk about it like it's a like this market has been going on now for some time. But in essence,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3776660","3783060"," it really hasn't. And the drugs and approved just for obesity as a sub sub segment of this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3783060","3789700"," population is very new. Jared, we've talked about Viking therapeutics which tripled in a single day"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3790340","3795780"," based on its dual agonist which showed similar results to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's drug."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3795780","3801220"," But in terms of the 70 potential, you know, anti-obesity drugs in the pipeline,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3801220","3805140"," what do you think are the most promising in terms of actually breaking through? I mean,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3805140","3809380"," I know there are several companies who are working with combination weight loss drugs"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3809380","3814740"," plus drugs that will actually help you gain muscle mass. So combating the number one,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3814740","3818900"," you know, one of the biggest side effect concerns currently with this class of drugs."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3820340","3824900"," Yeah, Melissa, I think on that point, I'm still probably betting on Lily in terms of their"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3824900","3830100"," pipeline and development. I mean, they've proven it before. They're working on other modalities,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3830100","3836420"," including, you know, less frequent dosing, which I actually don't think is that big of a deal. I"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3836420","3842420"," think it's easy to monitor yourself as a patient on this once weekly. So I'm not exactly sure if"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3842420","3847380"," this once monthly or once quarterly or as you alluded to once a year is really going to take"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3847380","3853380"," off and be a game changer. But I think they're probably in the lead from a number of different"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3853380","3858580"," modalities for the drug, including an oral, including muscle sparing. And there, you know,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3858580","3862500"," a bunch of biotech companies kind of in the background working on that as well. And they're"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3862500","3867540"," all kind of, you know, obviously super focused on it. I mean, every other headline we get out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3867540","3873620"," of this sector lately is another company, whether in the public or private arena, trying to like,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3873620","3877620"," you know, tell the street that they have something in development, or they're moving"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3877620","3881300"," something into the clinic. So it's something we're going to obviously keep an eye on here for a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3881300","3885860"," while. So what is the total addressable market? How do you make those calculations and give"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3885860","3891780"," evaluation on a stock which you clearly really like? There's more demand and supply. But how do"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3891780","3895300"," you think about the numbers and the potential? I know it's a relevant question for even some of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3895300","3902740"," the food companies that I cover. Totally. I don't think you can really get to a realistic"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3903460","3909460"," number in terms of the addressable market. I mean, the population in the US of 330 million,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3910020","3914420"," you kind of, you know, kind of have to separate that into the adult population,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3914420","3920260"," what percentage of adults are obese, call it a third. That's kind of how the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3920260","3925140"," models are being built. And you can get to some astronomical numbers if you're willing just to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3925140","3930900"," take the base population, what you believe is the percent that are overweight, and then multiply"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3930900","3936500"," that by roughly $1,000 per month, which is the going rate of these drugs, especially if you're"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3936500","3942980"," paying out of pocket. So it's very easy for analysts around the street to get to $100 billion plus."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3942980","3947540"," I know, you know, there are some investors out there who think $100 billion by 2030"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3947540","3952340"," is actually going to prove to be light. But on the other hand, you know, you've got the payer"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3952340","3957540"," complex, which you guys talked about earlier, who's going to actually pay for it on the other side."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3957620","3961540"," I think right now, I mean, going back to, you know, where we are in market adoption,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3961540","3966260"," I don't think we really scratched the surface yet in terms of getting the drug to middle America,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3966260","3971380"," different regions where the obese population is more prevalent, because again, affordability"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3971380","3976580"," and access, this is basically a new year. 11 a.m. and you're trying to get drunk for starters."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3976580","3980260"," But I think in terms of building the market, it's really prime,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3980260","3986420"," online by some kind of 50 Fed manufacturing is prior minus 17. We also expect to come in from"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3986420","3989940"," some top of that. Who joins the fair, then, for a moment,"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3989940","3995060"," treatment of the national time, no text to expect to be in any slide."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","3995060","4000740"," That's where I think you're going to have abnormalities or reconciliations between estimates and what"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","4000740","4006420"," these companies. Yeah. Jared, yeah, I've got to end it there. But always appreciate your time."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","4006420","4009620"," Thank you. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Thank you."
"k4ebLbMLw-E","4009620","4011060"," As well. Good luck tonight. Thank you."

"k4ebLbMLw-E","5029520","5036080"," Yeah, let me get started. So one of the conversations cap and I were having this morning. I was like, I asked him because we have a common friend"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5036800","5040240"," And I told him that hey, I was gonna gonna go, uh, gonna talk to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5040960","5044080"," Cap jim jimmed and he was like, hey ask him. Is he short?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5044960","5046160"," And I was like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5046160","5049520"," Caps always heads enough, which is kind of the way to do"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5050160","5052160"," uh, do things and um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5053600","5055440"," And uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5055440","5057840"," What cap and I started talking was that we both"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5058560","5060560"," Are seeing an upside to the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5061200","5066640"," I will talk about why I think it is a limited upside to the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5066720","5071760"," It's just on some of the data i've seen some of it's like, you know, some of its"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5072560","5078560"," Stuff that i've looked at and i've kind of like kept an eye on so I kind of want to um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5079520","5081520"," You know put this out there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5081920","5083360"," but how"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5083360","5084960"," I actually think"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5084960","5087920"," The move is going to be explosive to the upside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5088720","5093920"," But it's probably only going to last a week or so and probably by next friday"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5094560","5098400"," I will be cutting down on a lot of my exposure into this market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5098880","5103520"," So you're saying that you think that the upside potential ends next friday"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5104560","5111520"," Uh, I think I I i'm not saying it ends completely, but I think on in this cycle in this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5112320","5117120"," Rally that we've gone where we have completely ignored seasonality so far"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5117680","5122560"," We have haven't we have we talked about that yesterday. We have ignored that completely"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5123200","5129120"," Yes, and that is what um, you know, kind of gives me a little pause for concern"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5129520","5134960"," And you know what while we're talking let me generate a seasonality chart for right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5135200","5137200"," So we can kind of talk about it"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5137200","5139200"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5139520","5140560"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5140560","5142560"," Spy is what I want"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5143440","5151440"," So I have all these tools that i've built for myself and um, i'm happy to you know share them with people"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5152320","5154320"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5161600","5167520"," So while I kind of do that, uh, yeah, so we've kind of run through seasonality and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5168240","5169040"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5169600","5172160"," Let me kind of first start by showing"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5173360","5175600"," Uh, this thing that's on your screen right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5175680","5180720"," It's something I started doing for like my subreddit that I like that I moderate plus like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5181360","5184880"," Just hang out and shoot the shit after hours and um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5186960","5188480"," Let's put it there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5188480","5190480"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5190480","5196320"," What I am uh, what you're seeing on your screen right now is uh, what I call the overlayer"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5197280","5202080"," Um, can you guys see this? Let me make do you want me to make this a little bigger? I think you're good man"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5203520","5205520"," All right, so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5205520","5207520"," To us"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5207520","5213920"," Yeah, so what it is um, the first figure you see is you i've kind of shown you this before"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5214000","5221280"," This is where I run a statistical analysis. I run correlations over 101 period windows"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5221840","5223600"," um across"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5223600","5229520"," Like very busy since 1929 and find time periods where the correlation is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5230160","5234400"," um above a certain threshold right now my cut off is 0.93"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5235040","5237200"," and then out of the all the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5238240","5241760"," Windows that it shows me I run a statistical test to see"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5242480","5247120"," Which one of these time series or have been predictive of the current"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5247600","5255200"," Trisaction time series. So what you have here is the as it stands right now, and i'm only showing the top seven"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5256000","5259280"," Uh correlations all of these are over 0.97"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5259920","5265200"," So the thing that we are most closely tracking is 1960s"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5265920","5266880"," from"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5266880","5268880"," November 11th"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5269760","5271760"," Sorry from the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5272000","5273840"," 25th"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5273920","5277920"," Uh, so 1960s, uh, November 11th to 1961"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5278720","5283600"," October 25th, that is the blue line. That is what we are most closely following"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5284160","5289840"," The second closest line is this orange line down here that we were following very very closely"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5290320","5294320"," Uh in the same way that it kept going up, but there has been a divergence"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5295120","5297680"," You see like right here about a week ago"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5298320","5299280"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5299280","5300080"," It"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5300080","5304720"," Was going to be supposed to be the top, but we continued to move up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5305600","5312000"," Getting us more correlated with this 1960s line. So this is the possible options"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5313280","5315280"," if historical price trends"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5315680","5316880"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5316880","5320480"," Are indicative of how market psychology is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5322240","5326240"," These are possible outcomes of what could happen what has happened in the past when"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5326800","5328800"," uh, the price action has been"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5329360","5334320"," Similar for about 101 days and that's about four months because it's 101 trading days"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5335120","5336320"," so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5336320","5338640"," Below this I have another, um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5339760","5344480"," Uh, I have another, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, over layer, but this is only for"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5345280","5348000"," election years where there is an election"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5348960","5350080"," and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5350080","5354880"," Surprise surprise 1960s line, which was the highest correlated one was an election year"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5355280","5357280"," and that's why I think"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5357520","5363120"," This is like really important to kind of keep an eye on is that yes, we might continue to go up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5363200","5368480"," But there is a dip coming we and because there's catalysts around to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5369440","5375200"," Set everything, uh, up for a squeeze. I think we have to be as traders"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5375200","5380080"," We really careful going into next week and I will talk about that in a second"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5382080","5384320"," Can you guys see my screen or is yeah?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5384320","5386960"," No, what I'm doing is, um, increasing the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5388160","5392960"," Resolution to 720 so people can now see your screen and then I actually made your screen larger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5392960","5396960"," You would now take up the entire screen brother. Oh perfect. Thank you. Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5402240","5405920"," Can you guys see that out there? Can you guys can you guys say something in the chat really quick?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5405920","5408640"," I want to see if you guys can see everything at home"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5409360","5411360"," If you're watching on a tv screen"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5412000","5414000"," You guys can see the resistance above here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5414000","5418560"," They're trying to sell into that first yellow box if we can break above that we'll start squeezing again"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5419360","5425120"," Uh, let me know in the chat. I don't see anything in the chat right now. The chat box is here, but I'm not seeing it"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5426000","5431120"," Yeah, I see it. Um, I I have there we go. I'm starting to see some chat right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5431840","5438240"," Yeah, yeah, I see it. It looks good. Yeah, so there we go. Oh, yeah, that's why I'm not seeing any chat. Hold on here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5438240","5440240"," I gotta bring the chat box"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5440960","5442960"," Hold on here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5442960","5444320"," There we go"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5444320","5445280"," That's great"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5445280","5447440"," All right, there we go. We got more chat coming in here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5448000","5448480"," So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5448480","5454080"," Dreamberry's saying election year normally ends higher so we will pull back then rally into end of year where we will see"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5454400","5457360"," 5200 or higher than the big collapse will happen"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5458160","5462480"," All right. All right, get back out of their trader podcast. People are asking you questions now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5463120","5468960"," Got gotcha. Yeah, so um, yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with that. I'll also say that most years we go up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5469520","5471760"," You know, yeah most years we go up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5472880","5474960"," Say that louder"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5474960","5479280"," Yeah, most years we go up. So, you know, even if there's a correction correction zone last years"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5479840","5484960"," So, you know, that's we go about three and a half on average to five years up and then about a year and a half pullback"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5485040","5487280"," Right normally it's like 18 months or something like that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5487360","5492480"," You know, and one of them is because like we had a huge long recession right like downturn in the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5492800","5496880"," Was a bear market for a long time and that kind of sees it, but it's usually you know like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5497520","5499520"," 16 months or so like at the most"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5500640","5501840"," so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5501840","5503840"," Anyways, what i'm trying to say is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5504400","5505600"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5505600","5513200"," The historical overlayer for 1960 kind of tells us that hey, there's like a squeeze coming and these vertical lines that are on this chart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5513760","5515920"," are actually uh 10 days apart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5517440","5518320"," So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5518320","5522000"," Uh, what this is telling me show me that again. Let me look closer show me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5522720","5527520"," Do you have a highlighter on your chrome that you can circle stuff or do you want me to circle it on my end?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5527920","5532080"," Oh, if you can circle it, I can make it even bigger. Yeah, you make it bigger and then um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5533360","5537760"," How about you point to your cursor and i'll circle where you're talking about so right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5537920","5544480"," So right in here guys, can you guys see that right there? There's uh, he's expecting possibly one more squeeze up right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5545200","5548960"," Um for the correction you guys see that on the chart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5549920","5556480"," I'm gonna remove my drawing there. So that little purple that little blue light blue zone right here. We're tracking this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5557120","5558720"," the black"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5558720","5560720"," line that you see right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5561520","5566160"," And then he's looking for that one last squeeze higher. So that would be the pain trade"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5566720","5568720"," uh, if you're trying to time"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5570320","5571520"," the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5571520","5572800"," correction"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5572800","5578000"," Uh, his point would be that's between now if i'm wrong here trader podcast correct me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5578640","5583840"," But he's saying that there's a window almost like a window of weakness. There's a window into next friday"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5584720","5586720"," for a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5586720","5589760"," obscene squeeze higher if any of you"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5590480","5592320"," Are a pro trader"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5592320","5596560"," You should go back into the pro trader market updates or pro updates"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5597200","5600880"," And I have a charts in there on a I think they're one day charts"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5601520","5606800"," that show this exact thing happening a um a major squeeze to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5607440","5612640"," Uh five twenty five and even five thirty five possibly before the correction"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5613280","5618400"," Right. So all right. So go on uh trader podcast. Yeah, so if you want to let kind of get a measure of that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5618480","5621680"," It's about a four percent squeeze like four percent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5622560","5627040"," Yeah, but from the nader. It is almost it is almost five"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5628720","5633840"," From the bottom here to the top. It's yeah, it can it can be a pretty"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5634480","5637280"," Significant squeeze over a couple of days"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5637760","5642480"," Uh, just because of how things are set up and I will show you that in a second here. Let's put a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5642880","5644400"," let me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5644400","5647840"," Let's look at what four to five percent is right now. Okay"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5652800","5656960"," That should put us around four twenty five four twenty six. That's what I've got"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5658480","5663040"," I was going to show up these guys, but I've got four twenty five and an extension"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5664000","5669920"," Uh, I've got an extension to five thirty five excuse me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5671200","5675360"," Uh, so you got four percent is about four percent is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5679200","5682160"," All right, I got there five twenty seven eighty roughly"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5682880","5688800"," Right, uh, but I've got four I've got five twenty five in the low end and then I've got a up to five thirty five"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5688880","5690880"," Which is about five percent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5691040","5697840"," Uh, right right around it's five point three six percent up there. So I think we're on the same boat together, man"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5698560","5703200"," Yeah, the only thing I would also add to that is that we have to kind of remember not to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5703760","5709280"," Have that as like oh, we are definitely going there because we have more sophisticated products"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5709840","5713920"," Uh in the market now, right? I was going to talk about that in a second. Let's do that too"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5714800","5718800"," Yeah, yeah, we have more sophisticated products. We have zero dt options"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5718800","5722800"," 1960s. They did not have options. So you had more volatility"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5723280","5729680"," Uh, you know, like squeezes can happen now. It's like, you know, like if squeezes start happening people start having hammering zero dt"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5730240","5732240"," That effect at the end of the day goes away"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5732480","5737440"," Right, that's right end of the day. It goes away and it and it's impact is different throughout the day"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5737440","5739680"," If you open them on the open and then towards the close"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5740240","5744640"," Any kind of size there are other ramifications as we get closer to the end of the day too"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5745040","5746720"," right and so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5746720","5750880"," Based on that just I want to give quick segue follow uh options depth"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5751520","5755200"," on um on twitter he puts out a spx"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5755840","5758480"," Intraday gamma map dealer gamma map"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5759120","5761760"," Which is really really interesting the way they've"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5762320","5768000"," Figured out how to map the price action based on the dealer gamma and banner and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5768320","5774320"," Can you read can you read me alpha numerically that that handles so that I can post it? I will put it in chat"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5777360","5780800"," Yeah, pop that in chat so that I can post it in the discord as well"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5782000","5783520"," Yeah"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5783520","5787200"," Um, so that's the twitter handle. They're really really smart people"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5787600","5792080"," They put out the map like every morning on twitter and you can kind of like read it kind of have it as"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5792480","5795440"," Your reference uh with the price action that's going on"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5795760","5798560"," And it kind of shows you where the gamma over the day decays"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5799200","5803120"," So where the support lines are going to be and where like the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5803920","5806720"," The resistance lines are going to be it's it's a really cool chart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5807040","5810160"," Um anyways, so we kind of talked about"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5810960","5816480"," The over layer with some of the other stuff. I'm like keeping a track of is the percentage of stocks in each"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5817200","5819200"," ETF"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5819680","5824000"," Sector ETFs and I w a lot here. Sorry about that. Yeah, no worries"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5825440","5827440"," Keep doing your thing continue"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5828000","5830000"," Yeah, so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5830800","5838160"," Right here. Um, so I kind of keep a track of that this kind of gives me very quickly a visualization of how markets are"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5838800","5846480"," You know, like reacting because so currently we have over 60 percent of stocks across"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5847280","5850480"," All the ETFs above their 50 sma"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5851120","5854240"," And that's something I want you to kind of keep in the back of your mind"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5854800","5860960"," And more than that we have about 62ish percent above their 20 sma"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5861520","5866080"," So remember like this 50 and 20 smas. They are a sign of momentum"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5866560","5872880"," So you kind of want to keep an eye on this if this starts getting too high, you know, like momentum is going to start getting topped up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5873840","5875040"," and um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5875040","5877360"," This is another chart. I do this is or"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5877680","5879120"," uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5879120","5880560"," on"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5880560","5886160"," Sorry, so this one I have just the chart as a snapshot and how many are above"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5886960","5888960"," These charts are all"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5888960","5889920"," your"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5889920","5891760"," uh year to date"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5891760","5896640"," And for example in xlc how many percentage of stocks are above their sma's year to date"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5897120","5899680"," So right now you can kind of see this is on a down trend"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5900240","5903200"," xlc is on a down trend you kind of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5904160","5908880"," Come and see if with xlu xlu has bottomed"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5910560","5913760"," More and more companies are starting to get above their"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5915440","5918160"," Their sma's they're 200 sma their 50 sma"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5918560","5920960"," So when you kind of see start seeing something like that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5921600","5928240"," You kind of be like, oh, is this like rotation starting to happen? Is that sector like bottom and if utilities is starting to like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5929200","5930640"," get a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5930720","5935840"," Kick that means here is the defensive trade on so something to keep an eye on so this is something"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5936080","5941360"," I do every day at the end of it. I look at all these charts to try and figure out what's happening"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5941600","5947360"," What is really heartening to me is that this particular chart iwm iwm"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5948000","5949280"," has"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5949280","5950880"," kind of bottom"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5950880","5951920"," and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5951920","5956480"," More and more company is our and tickers is 2000 of them in iwm"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5956960","5958960"," They are getting above their"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5959280","5960960"," sma's"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5960960","5962640"," Across the board. Excuse me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5963920","5969120"," Similarly with spx more companies more number of participants are getting above"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5969520","5974000"," So this is telling you that this is a rally. That's like broadening out. I track"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5974960","5977840"," How many companies or which tickers"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5979360","5983760"," Produce and ETF a high 52 a 52 week high or low"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5984480","5990960"," Um, I track how many of spx stocks are above the 20 em and this is important to me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5991520","5996480"," Because this is when it starts getting above like 400 you kind of need to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","5997200","5999760"," Stop and be like, okay a downturn might be coming"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6000400","6006320"," This there's no more room for them to run above 20 em and because this is usually these usually mark a market top"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6006800","6009600"," And to that effect I actually plotted out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6010080","6015440"," Yes, someone was commenting earlier this week that we couldn't get above the 10m 10m ema either"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6016880","6019360"," Well, that's interesting. Yeah, well, this is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6020400","6022400"," That's something that was earlier in the week though"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6022560","6027120"," Yeah, I can look into that. I can see how many stocks in the smb 500"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6027680","6031840"," are above their 10m ema and how that translates to like returns"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6032240","6035040"," So these are the returns what's really important is, you know"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6035360","6041600"," Forward 30 day inevitably we go up always, you know, if only if most of the companies are below"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6042080","6044080"," their 50, uh, sorry their"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6044720","6048400"," 20 ema that's when you like long and just sit and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6048880","6052880"," Once they start getting to the 400 and five or 450 range more than that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6053120","6055760"," You kind of have to be like, okay. We in the short term"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6055840","6063280"," They might be a pullback like especially like once it's more than 450 companies of the smb 500 above their credit ema"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6063360","6068000"," Again, something to think about. This is a work in progress is the high low index"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6068000","6072720"," I don't really want to get into that. I'll have the mikelyn oscillator and this is what I wanted to get"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6072800","6074800"," This is the last plot I wanted to show"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6075040","6083040"," um, this mikelyn mikelyn oscillator is a way to see like the momentum visualizing momentum"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6083440","6087200"," Um within the market and again these peaks"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6088000","6089440"," they usually"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6089440","6090720"," signify"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6090720","6092400"," a local top"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6092400","6097600"," So what I am seeing right now is that the mikelyn oscillator has plenty of room"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6098400","6100400"," Um, jimmy, let me check right now. Sorry"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6102160","6105760"," Sorry, I mean to interrupt. I apologize. Oh, no worries. Well, I didn't kind of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6107840","6109840"," Have I"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6110080","6113040"," Sorry, sorry. Sorry apologize. I didn't mean to speak of the mic"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6113120","6114400"," injection"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6114400","6119840"," Talk about the momentum with the mikelyn summation index. Yeah, so I just see this room to go up. Okay"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6120640","6121600"," So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6121600","6124880"," That I kind of want to see like this is why I think the market hasn't quite topped yet"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6125280","6127440"," We can still go up and we can"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6127440","6131200"," Explosively go up, you know, this kind of does show that before like the market tops off"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6131920","6133600"," I want to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6133600","6135280"," bring up some"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6135280","6138880"," Statistics and I'm going to borrow stuff from no mura"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6139600","6142960"," And this is what this particular chart. I want to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6143840","6146080"," Make bigger and show you guys"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6146960","6151920"," So this is the sharp ratios and returns of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6154560","6157360"," Of different strategies in the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6157840","6161200"," Uh, that the big boys employ, you know, are they selling straddles in the morning?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6161200","6163840"," Are they selling a call at the money call at the money put?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6164240","6169600"," Are they selling a daily strangle? Are they selling a 25 day out call? Are they selling a 25 day output?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6170160","6175040"," Are they selling a daily selling daily straddle, but our long straddle themselves, you know, these are like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6176160","6181040"," This is the stuff they teach you in finance classes on, you know, how you do portfolio construction"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6181360","6183760"," You know, like how you could do things. What I want to like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6184480","6186960"," Show you guys is that the selling"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6187760","6190000"," the daily at the money put"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6191120","6194480"," And selling a 25 day output and buying a 25 day call"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6195200","6200480"," Have the highest returns 13 percent and 13.8 percent and their sharp ratios are over two"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6201360","6206240"," Just call or just put essentially put writing has paid up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6206720","6208720"," handsomely for the last year"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6209680","6212000"," And if you kind of go back"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6212480","6219920"," Uh, do I have this chart in this one, but there's another chart I could probably pull up. Uh, I might actually have that in this one"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6224640","6226640"," Uh, no, I don't have it in this one either"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6226720","6230320"," Uh, but anyways, uh, what this is important because these"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6232320","6239920"," The the amount of assets that are in systematic funds that do this have essentially doubled in the last year"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6239920","6241920"," They've gone from like a hundred billion"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6242240","6247280"," Assets under management to over 200 billion assets under management because this has been"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6247920","6249920"," one of the craziest ways"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6250560","6255360"," Of making money in this like last year. This is why everybody's saying we're crashing up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6255440","6260480"," This is why I think we're crashing up is because there's just so much money so much"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6260880","6264000"," vol supply in the market every day that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6265120","6266320"," Nobody"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6266320","6272400"," Like the market's not going to fall and this is why it also occurs. You might have heard a lot of people say that's nobody's hedged in the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6273200","6275200"," Right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6275920","6280720"," Volways wants to talk about that vol supply that's in the market too this week. I think on friday"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6281760","6283760"," Okay, that's great. Yeah"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6283760","6285760"," That's uh, that's awesome"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6286640","6288160"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6288160","6289920"," I would I would love to I would love to hear that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6290720","6296720"," And vol signals is kind of fantastic. I need to get him on the show too. Yeah, Carson is amazing"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6296960","6298960"," You do need to get him on the show"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6298960","6303280"," But as soon as all this stuff as soon as we get like we haven't even done a hard launch here yet man"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6303280","6307920"," The moment that we get that hard launch done and over with over the weekend"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6308640","6312400"," I'm going to start reaching out to guys like him and uh, there's a bunch of people out there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6312400","6315440"," They've been meaning to bring on the show and I haven't had a chance to get him on yet"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6316240","6319920"," Um, so I'm hoping to get a bunch of people on here in the coming weeks"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6320320","6324640"," Um, so we can all just chat and uh, hear your opinions and stuff like that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6325520","6328240"," So yeah, but ball signals. I want to get him on for sure"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6328720","6331840"," I talked to him briefly, but I haven't had a chance to fall back up with him"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6333120","6335120"," And I like him a lot too"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6335120","6336320"," Yeah, definitely"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6336400","6343840"," So anyways, so what is the impact of these strategies that are in the market like every day and I want to bring up this chart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6344400","6347920"," So this is what happens when somebody when a fund wants to sell puts right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6348880","6350880"," Somebody's got to buy the puts"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6351360","6353360"," So that's what a market maker does"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6353600","6360880"," So a market maker's job is to absorb the orders that come into the market and this is a chart from the 23rd"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6361440","6366000"," So it's about six days old, but this still stands actually it's gotten even worse"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6366720","6370960"," The dealers are currently in short gamma in certain pockets"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6371760","6373760"," and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6373760","6375760"," This is because"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6377120","6378560"," Clients"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6378560","6382640"," Having customers traders have been buying upside calls"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6383680","6387680"," into the 54 from 5,300 to 5,400 area"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6389120","6391120"," and into"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6391120","6393120"," the 5,200 to 50"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6394000","6401360"," Well, 5150 to like 5250 area. There's a lot of short walls of short gamma"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6402240","6402960"," pocket"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6402960","6409520"," So what happens at this when dealers are short gamma. This is where you get explosive moves in the upside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6411200","6414080"," When dealers are long gamma such as these pockets"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6414880","6416880"," That you see this is where we get a grind"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6417840","6421280"," And this is kind of where we are and this is again six days old"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6421360","6423360"," So this might have shifted around a little bit"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6423520","6429920"," But these areas the reason if dealers are long gamma they will sell every rip and they will buy every dip"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6430480","6433280"," This is why the daily straddle is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6434080","6436080"," like very very small"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6436640","6438160"," and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6438160","6440880"," Do you guys remember that big rally we got off of Nvidia?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6442080","6445520"," The big rally we got off of Nvidia was in this pocket right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6446240","6448480"," Because we were towards the bottom of this pocket"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6448960","6452240"," Before Nvidia earnings we had kind of sold off into it if you guys remember"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6452800","6456320"," And then Nvidia saved the market and we ripped face for three percent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6456960","6462000"," Essentially like between overnight and the next day. That was this area right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6462480","6468320"," So anytime there is short gamma on the dealer side. That's where you see big ball pops"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6468320","6470320"," I"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6473680","6479760"," Okay, so I kind of wanted to show this I've got a I've also got some questions. So whenever you're ready"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6480400","6483760"," Yeah, give me a text. Give me a text them to you in the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6484880","6490240"," Chat so you can prepare for those questions or if you don't want to answer them. You don't have to if you're like, I'm not prepared for that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6491360","6496400"," Sometimes they get I get asked I get asked people ask me questions dude about things. They're like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6498960","6500960"," We want an answer right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6501040","6503040"," So I don't know"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6503040","6509920"," One more just a market update here. That's uh that demand that stink bid down below is at 5061"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6510560","6511840"," On book map"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6511840","6515040"," Um, do you want to just text them to you and see what you want to answer or no?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6515200","6518160"," No, no, just ask me if I can answer it. I'll answer it if I"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6519120","6525040"," Response to it. I will okay. Uh, the first question comes from uh, jimmy berry"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6525840","6527360"," Mm-hmm"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6527360","6531680"," And he says a trader podcast have you factored in"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6532880","6538800"," Six trillion dollars. Yeah, he will. He said a few things. He said election years normally and higher. So we will pull back"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6539520","6545360"," We talked about that what he said earlier. He said normally you have 18 to 21 years cycles, which correlates with the housing market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6546000","6549840"," COVID interrupted the cycle. So 2025 will be the collapse"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6550720","6555040"," He says and senators will blame trump for the u.s. Economy collapse"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6555600","6560000"," Now jimmy berry. I don't think I think he's a democrat. So he's just being uh, he's not a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6560000","6564000"," I don't think he's being biased air at all in that statement if you don't know that already"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6564000","6566000"," I think jimmy is an old school dem"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6566160","6568160"," Uh, because trump will be the president"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6568800","6571200"," Uh, that's how they will finally get rid of trump"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6571280","6574480"," But personally I like the dude. Oh, he says the person I like to do is president"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6574640","6577840"," So he likes him. Yeah, that will be the that will be the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6578400","6580400"," Pullback 5% retrace"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6580960","6585200"," He says trader podcast have you factored in the injection of six trillion"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6585760","6587760"," Into the market since covid"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6588320","6591040"," And that's six trillion that was injected by the fed"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6592320","6598400"," Yeah, never I have never in 35 years of trading ever used gamma either"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6599520","6603280"," Simplified trading in two categories demand levels supply levels and price"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6603920","6605920"," Yesterday's high still holding for now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6607280","6609280"," Politicians are all wankers. He says"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6610560","6613760"," So what's your what have you taken into any consideration?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6614400","6618000"," um like my questionnaire would be if you take any consideration into"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6619280","6620640"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6620640","6624480"," The injection of liquidity into the market and then possibly even"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6625120","6630560"," Uh, the secret liquidity injections we see through the treasury department right now. I would add to that question"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6631360","6634480"," Yes, I have and I have a very different somewhat"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6635280","6638880"," Uh academic response to that. Let's hear it. All right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6640240","6641760"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6641760","6643680"," the reason"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6643680","6645680"," the fact that we actually"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6646640","6648560"," Had all of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6648560","6650000"," that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6650000","6655200"," Liquidity pump into the system is the reason why I think higher for longer is actually good for the markets"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6656000","6662160"," Yeah, try to smooth that out over years rather than just six months or 12 months. I like that answer"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6662960","6668320"," You know why and so this is I know a lot of people make fun of modern monetary theory, but I actually really like it"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6668800","6675120"," I enjoy the core tenets of modern monetary theory, which is basically if"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6676160","6682400"," You are a country with a sovereign currency. So there's only two countries in the world that fits right though"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6683120","6685280"," the united states and the united kingdom"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6686560","6688560"," You are a central reserve currency"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6689120","6693840"," And to a to an extent. I guess japan too. You can kind of see that because you were seeing that happen over there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6694480","6695760"," when you"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6695760","6700400"," inject money into the economy like that's a good point to make about"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6701120","6706320"," uh japan's having that coming out moment, right? They're trying to compete now with uh china, right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6706960","6708160"," For some extent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6708160","6711200"," And the thing is the yen carry trade has been like going on"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6712160","6713680"," Going on two years"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6713680","6717520"," Well a year at least right and uh they're gonna raise rates at some point"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6718080","6722000"," And we're kind of seeing some interesting stuff happen already in the dollar"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6722400","6725120"," But I don't want to get into those uh into that's like we're right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6725840","6732240"," Talk about that. Yes. So I want to address that question about the six trillion dollars of liquidity injected"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6732720","6736880"," So modern monetary theory says something very simple that taxes don't really fucking matter"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6737840","6742880"," Taxes are just a way to siphon off money out of the economy. So it doesn't run too hot"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6743200","6745920"," what actually the the money printer the digitally"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6746560","6749600"," the digital capability of producing loans"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6750480","6757440"," Originating loans and basically creating more money in the system is what really sets apart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6757840","6760160"," You're the united states and the united kingdom"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6760800","6761920"," now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6761920","6763920"," modern monetary theory says"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6764000","6768080"," That as long as there is absorptive capacity in the sectors where you inject money"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6768800","6770400"," which is basically"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6770400","6772240"," can they"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6772240","6775280"," Can they take that extra cash and not run too hot"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6776560","6778560"," and uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6778560","6780400"," If if that's the case"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6780400","6787760"," Uh, you're not going to have an inflation problem. The issue we ran with is that we give everybody money and we gave it to them in discretionary"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6788320","6792320"," Areas, so that's why we and then we have a supply shock at the same time during covid"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6792320","6794720"," That's why we got rambic run away inflation"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6795680","6797680"," now as I said the core tenet of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6798400","6799760"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6799760","6802800"," Modern monetary theory is that you don't need"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6803520","6808000"," Um, you know taxes don't really do anything. You know, it's the government budget and all of that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6808000","6809600"," It doesn't really matter"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6809600","6812960"," Midmatists to his extent, but not not the way people make it out to be"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6813360","6815360"," Uh, but taxes are a way"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6815840","6818880"," Um to kind of suck liquidity out of the system"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6819520","6820880"," the other way"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6820960","6822960"," Is higher interest rates"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6823040","6825840"," Um, they're a good way to suck liquidity out of the system too"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6826560","6833200"," So that can happen over a longer time. That's why you know, I think everybody got used to the 0% interest rates"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6833280","6837280"," You know more bitches at 3% like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6837760","6840560"," Do you have any uh references?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6841600","6846880"," Uh consolidated resources that you would recommend to learn about mmt"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6848240","6849920"," Oh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6849920","6854480"," You know, who does a good job to me? Um, I can it might be able to answer that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6855120","6856640"," one of the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6856640","6858080"," uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6858080","6862320"," One of the ref our resources I use is uh bob kendall"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6862960","6868160"," Hill at times do uh spaces interviews with guys that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6869120","6873360"," um at one time health huge positions in our government or"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6874400","6876400"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6876720","6880000"," Counseling our government and uh, they will delve into"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6880960","6882960"," the truth behind mmt"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6883360","6887120"," Uh, i'll try to find a link to that for your career low out there at some point"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6887760","6893200"," Uh, some of those resources. Do you have any books or anything that you'd recommend on monotary theory?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6893920","6895840"," Stephanie kelton"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6895840","6902880"," Has she wrote a book, uh, and you know, like she was bernie sanders is uh economic. That's right. I remember that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6903520","6909920"," Yeah, so stephanie kelton, uh, she's one of the biggest proponents and that there's a professor from bard college"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6910400","6912400"," forget his name, um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6913200","6917440"," Her last book was the deficit myth modern monetary theory"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6918000","6922960"," And the birth of people of the people's economy. I think the rest of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6923440","6926560"," She's kind of like modern monetary theory is also like very much"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6926640","6929280"," I give you like really think about it like that's very much"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6929280","6931840"," I think the government can keep printing money and give money to people"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6932400","6934400"," right so it's kind of like very"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6935040","6938880"," socialist in nature, but it's not really it just basically telling you like what the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6939280","6941520"," Involvement of the government is and should be"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6942880","6951360"," Now, um, I think we're gonna go, uh close some gaps today. Yeah, we I think we've tried I think we've tracked this day pretty well here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6951360","6955040"," So far. I mean, yeah from what we've done here. We had the up move"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6955600","6959920"," We got the down move or the sideways and now we're doing the down move to close the gaps. This is the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6960800","6963440"," pre-market gap rip that we had right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6963440","6967040"," So just watch as price comes down and close that's closes that gap"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6967600","6969600"," uh, the big question here is going to be"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6970400","6973360"," Uh, the big questionnaire is going to be chase"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6974400","6976640"," answer our fucking question"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6978640","6983440"," What's our question getting a chat? Well, so chase was a long put spreads"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6984560","6988720"," Uh, this more or yesterday in the close and iWm and my question to him was"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6989440","6994880"," Are you going to diamond hand your put spreads and then when we retrace back down to the gap on the open"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","6995360","7000080"," Are you going to close them out or are you going to diamond hand those things into friday?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7000480","7004400"," So chase if you're out there, we're all patiently waiting brother"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7005440","7006720"," Yeah"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","7025760","7029520"," Let me take a look right now. We're trading 5 0 6 2 right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7030080","7031600"," So we can have a little bit more blood"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7031600","7035600"," So if you are if you're looking right now at that you get the first blood right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7036320","7041520"," You could see one more rejection here, right and then we you know you have the capitulation"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7042000","7044000"," By is actually lower"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","7073360","7078800"," Uh, it's dangerous buying a dip right here. You'd want to see us above the one in five minute trigger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7079280","7084400"," A successful back test and then beat this prior high over here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7085040","7088960"," Uh to be in safety again as a bull. Okay, so this is very dangerous here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7089360","7092560"," You'll see me do stupid shit down here and start buying zero dates"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7093040","7096560"," Uh, but I don't recommend it to you out there watching the show right now until"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","7189600","7196480"," He's asking. I think he's basically asking can are you canceling out the anomaly of covid or not in your"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","7201600","7202720"," um"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","7795520","7798080"," Down to 64 so 20 handles in about"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7799520","7801520"," 20 minutes like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7802240","7807840"," 12 minutes. Yeah, this they're kind of like selling that off now. So anyways, that's kind of how that goes"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7808480","7812640"," Plenty of calls up while put sellers around to support the market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7812640","7814640"," But"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7814640","7817600"," Any other questions is there anything else you guys want me to look at?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7817600","7821840"," I'm happy to look at positioning for tickers if you're interested on hero"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7822480","7824320"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7824320","7827520"," Oh, TQQ flow. Look at that. Somebody just bought"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7828160","7829520"," Holy moly"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7829520","7834400"," Somebody just bought 17.5 million in call delta on TQQQ"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7835440","7838160"," We could probably look that up as to what strikes they bought"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7843520","7845840"," Pull out a second or watching something in the background"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7846480","7848160"," Yeah, yeah, no sure man"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7848160","7849760"," Uh guild"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7849760","7851920"," Killiad some calls came in"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7852720","7856880"," It is below its last close apple put wall breached"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7857680","7861040"," Uh, oh, that means there's a bounce opportunity right here at 180"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7862640","7867760"," Anytime something like apple goes below its put wall. It is usually supported"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7868560","7869760"," so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7869760","7871760"," Good oriner on longs here"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","7882720","7884720"," Goldman Sachs"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7884720","7886720"," weekly call buying"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7887040","7889040"," So tomorrow somebody's bought"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7889840","7892080"," five million in call delta in"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7893120","7900640"," 39 55 so 15 in the last 15 minutes for 15 million in call delta for tomorrow came in on golden sex"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7902640","7909520"," Which makes sense too because it's below its football. Okay. Anyways, I was just letting uh, our chase was it chases all upset right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7909600","7913760"," And I was asking him earlier if he was gonna close his put his put spreads, but uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7914720","7916880"," Well, I looked like he hasn't said I did right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7917440","7921760"," When you said about uh yolo into those zero dt calls i'm up 140 on them"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7922880","7925600"," Smoking right now trader podcast yolo"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7926400","7930640"," Zero date calls are you gonna sell them on 507 13 or are you gonna get out of them?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7931440","7937120"," Uh, I'm gonna see give me a second. Let me look at my chart really quick. Yep. How long you holding them for?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7937760","7939760"," It's there's your dt's so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7940960","7942960"," Well, we know it's for the day, but"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7944320","7947120"," Ideally, I would like to see a tag of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7948160","7949680"," uh like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7949680","7951440"," 438"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7951440","7955040"," So get these to be over a dollar from like 35 cents a piece"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7955840","7956720"," a third"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7956720","7960000"," 438 15 438 16 that's what i'll try and target"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7960800","7964720"," But you know i'm gonna stop up momma didn't vias no bitch. So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7966640","7973600"," Anyways, uh, let's see currently trading 436 93 for any of you tech nerds out there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7975040","7977040"," All right continue on"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7977440","7978560"," Uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7978560","7982400"," No, I mean i'm open to i'm open to whatever question you might have man like i'm"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7982720","7987040"," Let's see what these guys are saying right now. Um, let's see what some of these questions are"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7989360","7993920"," Uh trader podcast do you ever use uh trend t ri and"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","7994800","7999840"," Uh trader mo trade moxie is asking about a projection for AMD"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8001360","8003440"," AMD, yes, let me look that up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8004240","8008560"," He's like chamomath man. He's all chest and arms, but he's got skinny legs"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8009040","8016320"," No, man. I actually deadlifted three plates this morning. I'm i tell him dude. Tell me deadlifted this morning"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8017280","8021600"," Yeah, man. Like I I usually try to work out before market opens"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8023120","8026240"," He does it dude. He breaks it. I breaks off trend every morning"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8029040","8034640"," I am d how about how about a projection for AMD? So AMD we've had call flows"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8035280","8038160"," Uh very minimal put flows. It's been steady"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8038240","8039600"," This is chop"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8039600","8043040"," That's what that tells me you kind of want flows to kind of go up and down"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8043120","8049040"," But um there's flows that came in in the morning. Nobody's adding well up here is what I want to see"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8049440","8053840"," So, you know, it's call wall was at 180. It's busted through its call wall man"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8054560","8056560"," tomorrow's friday"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8057520","8059520"," Take some profits"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8060160","8062160"," Take some profits"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8063760","8067040"," So you know you're saying take profits on AMD into the weekend"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8067920","8069920"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8069920","8074800"," The the smart conservative thing to do would be to take profits and not add up here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8074800","8077280"," Especially given where its call wall is, but you know what?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8077760","8083440"," Since we are going to do this properly. Let's look at what positioning for AMD is. Yeah, it's opened it up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8083440","8085760"," That's nice. They fixed that for me. Okay"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8086960","8088960"," This is the put and call walls, right?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8089760","8096400"," 180 was the call wall right here. There's a bunch of puts down there and they're all getting fun. It's more right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8097040","8098480"," 182"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8098480","8100000"," Decent call"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8100000","8102000"," 185 decent call"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8103040","8105520"," Call gamma right here and then at 190"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8106000","8109040"," There's less at 190 and more at 185"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8109600","8113840"," And we are right around the 187 level, right? That's kind of where we are"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8114560","8116480"," Let's look at the live price"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8116480","8121200"," Yeah, we're right at the 187 188 level where there's minimal gamma"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8121440","8123920"," So if you kind of go back to the put"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8124480","8128960"," Uh, they'll call uh, we're above the call wall and we're in between those two"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8129440","8131440"," So there is a higher chance"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8131440","8134560"," That unless you break through and get closer to 190"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8135120","8137920"," That you're gonna like kind of ping pong and magnet there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8138560","8142080"," Yeah, or to be honest if it's 185"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8142640","8143680"," And"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8143680","8145440"," No more calls come in"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8145440","8150320"," Today like to the upside to hold the upside even more you're gonna see like a big"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8150960","8155760"," Reversal back and i'm talking reversal back to like possibly 170"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8157360","8159360"," So they will sell into that strength, right?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8159920","8164400"," They will because that's AMD and this is what they do. Where is the dip to buy an AMD?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8165360","8168240"," Um on options the dip to buy would be at 117"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8168720","8172960"," Put so do you hear that there start taking some profit any squeezing hires should be met with"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8173440","8176320"," Strength and selling you're buying the dip at 170"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8177040","8179200"," Right and so if you kind of like look"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8179840","8182400"," Um on the AMD term structure"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8184880","8189440"," Um people are looking the the wall is high"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8191680","8193680"," Four months out and higher"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8194000","8199760"," But they're selling around here like they're selling calls up there. There's there's selling puts down here. So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8201120","8203840"," Nothing's really like telling me that you they want to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8204480","8206480"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8206960","8209840"," Take the ticker down too much or take the ticker up too much"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8210320","8215680"," You know, it's kind of like they're just so that dealers are happy selling volatility for AMD"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8216240","8219040"," Like for the next three four months. So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8219760","8222560"," From that vault perspective, there's no edge there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8223200","8224080"," Uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8224080","8226000"," So you kind of have to go with momentum"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8226080","8231360"," We kind of have to go with where existing positioning is and that goes back to the other question I wanted to answer"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8231840","8236080"," About from the general gentleman who was talking about he's never used gamma to trade"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8237200","8239040"," Gamma just"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8239040","8243120"," There's confluence and where gamma exists and where support and demand zones are going to be"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8243120","8246160"," So if you support in demand zones great that works for you"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8246640","8251920"," If you add gamma into that picture, it tells you which support or demand zone is stronger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8252400","8254400"," That's all it does"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8254400","8258080"," It tells you and it's in my mind. It's kind of an advantage"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8258080","8261840"," It's kind of an unfair advantage if you know that and you're like are really good with the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8262400","8264720"," The the put demand zones"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8265200","8270560"," My my username on reddit is trade the zones. So I I come from the same"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8271840","8276320"," School of thought I was a zone to zone trader and I added"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8278240","8284480"," Volatility and options positioning into my toolbox for trading over the last two years plus i'm a data nerd"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8284480","8286480"," So I enjoy all of this stuff"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8287120","8289040"," All right, so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8289040","8291200"," AMD done anybody else"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8291280","8292320"," ELF"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8292320","8294080"," I'm a girl that they love that stuff"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8294080","8299200"," I know ELF is also the lipstick trade if anybody knows their history"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8299680","8302240"," In recessions if you think there's a recession happening"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8303120","8306560"," Or coming you should long I do you should long"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8307360","8312720"," Makeup because it's an easy way for women to feel good about themselves without having to spend a lot of money"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8313120","8315120"," uh ELF"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8315120","8318880"," I don't have live trading data for it, but I can oh actually I"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8319520","8325280"," Before we go to ELF, I wanted to see one other thing for AMD which is history"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8326880","8329280"," So on my chart like this table, I can see"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8330080","8331920"," the call wall"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8331920","8334080"," The call wall has been at 180 for a while"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8334640","8339120"," For three days. It was at 190. The put wall has been at 170 for a while"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8339760","8344320"," Uh, next expiry call volume 62 of all calls expire"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8344880","8345920"," tomorrow"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8345920","8352560"," 58% of all puts expire tomorrow. Um, yeah, just by looking at that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8353920","8355920"," And how much delta is expiring?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8356480","8365760"," About 4% delta is expiring tomorrow. Um, yeah, um, I would be I would be taking profits if I was in the AMD trade right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8366560","8370320"," Like I would be like starting to think about taking profits pretty"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8370960","8374160"," Pretty quickly. So now let's look at ELF positioning"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8374960","8382400"," Um, but call impact call walls at 210. Where is that trading right now? Can anybody actually let me pull up my chart for ELF"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8385280","8388320"," Let me keep an eye on my options as well"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8389520","8393440"," Holy moly 2.15 percent say 215 percent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8394800","8396800"," $35 to a dollar 10"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8401200","8403040"," Yeah"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8403040","8408080"," Well, let me just guys. Let me just manage the straight a little bit. Let me see where I want to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8409520","8412800"," Yeah, I I think I'm gonna just sell these and I'm gonna take the win"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8421120","8426480"," Right there. So I get something doing here in the background. Oh, no, it's okay because I'm actually getting out of my trade"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8427840","8429840"," Because I made money"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8429920","8434320"," You know, so you're taking this money on the five-minute trigger here or at least on this on SPY"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8434400","8436400"," There's still some squeezing that can be done here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8436800","8442320"," Well, we are in we are in the little bit of traffic here if you're watching the uh book mac chart down below we get some traffic"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8442560","8444560"," All up in this zone right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8445120","8451840"," So I had five calls. It wasn't a big position if somebody wants verification. I'm happy to drop screenshots"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8452320","8454320"," uh, but um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8455280","8458720"," I bought them for 35 cents each and five of them"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8458800","8461680"," So it wasn't a big trade and I just sold them for a dollar six"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8462480","8463360"," and that's"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8463360","8465520"," 200 percent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8465520","8470080"," On a 20-minute trade. You don't get those returns anywhere else except the american stock market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8470720","8471760"," so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8471760","8474160"," ELF where does that sit right now?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8475360","8479600"," Uh, it's at 207 so 210 is call wall"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8480480","8482480"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8484560","8488480"," There's not that much. There's there's no puts below so, um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8489600","8493760"," Yeah, that trying to show these guys the the roughness to get up there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8497840","8500000"," And pop show this for these guys here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8501600","8504080"," Right here. We don't want to see the rejection and the reversal here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8504080","8506880"," So we've got a bull or a bull plate or excuse me a bull cross"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8507440","8509440"," forming on the one in five-minute trigger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8509760","8513840"," Uh, if you are going to stay long here for more upside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8514400","8517840"," You're just looking for that cross see the white and red line right there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8518160","8521280"," If you end up getting thrown down there could be a liquidation breakdown here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8521760","8526000"," Just trying to take your stops out for the more continuation of the upside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8526720","8531520"," Uh, but if you do begin to reject below that uh one in that one hour trigger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8532080","8534640"," Down here at any point if you start to see any action like this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8535440","8540560"," Right and then we start begin to reject here be careful of that continuation of the downside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8541520","8547200"," All right, so go ahead again, uh, trader podcast and here's the here's they're trying to take your stops right here. Just adds up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8548000","8553120"," Yeah, I want to watch that right now. This is why I kind of was like, I'm out. That's good money. Why be greedy?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8554080","8555920"," That's uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8555920","8557520"," How much was that?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8557520","8562720"," So from 35 to like, you know, 70 cents times five. That's like 350 bucks"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8563600","8564880"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8564880","8565600"," So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8565600","8569520"," Yeah, let's just say let's call it 300 bucks, right? Let's call it 300 bucks"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8569520","8573680"," That's 300 bucks of chipotle's I can buy now. So that's lunches for the next two weeks"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8574320","8581360"," Um, that's how you should trade don't be greedy. Don't be agree a little pig bulls make money bears make money pigs get slaughtered"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8582000","8584000"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8584560","8586480"," All right, so you left um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8589840","8592800"," The chart looks bullish, but options positioning"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8593520","8598880"," Doesn't look that great because there's no puts you kind of like to get real drive up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8598960","8605680"," You want puts up up on these things too where people have like bought in the money puts and stuff and they get kind of smoked"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8606240","8609280"," Uh, all of the puts are like down here and below"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8609920","8614720"," So getting up is going to be a grind and plus, you know, like 200 has this big stick of call gamma"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8615040","8618240"," All the other call gamma is like diminishing past 210"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8618720","8626320"," I don't see that much strength in this from options positioning not saying fundamentally or news driven. It can't go up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8626800","8628800"," um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8629120","8633440"," But yes, uh, if if that was the question around here left"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8633440","8641120"," I honestly think it is a better a better trade would be that you sell credit call spreads on this you could kind of sell like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8642320","8644320"," Like a 45 day out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8644640","8645680"," You know"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8645680","8650960"," 220 230 spread and kind of capture some of the momentum back like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8651440","8656720"," Like a probably in 15 days make 20 30 percent on on that spread pretty easily"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8657120","8661920"," So that's one way to like look at it or you could do a put spread, but again, you might lose premium on that. So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8663120","8667040"," Um, hero call saying thank you very much a trader podcast"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8667760","8672720"," Yeah, no more of my pleasure, man. Um, we can look at my favorite ticker"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8673360","8675360"," uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8675360","8681520"," Bork trader podcast is saying that he sent a friend request to you via uh discord"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8682160","8687520"," Yes, because I can't send him a message otherwise because he's got that protection box thing going on. So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8688160","8690960"," I think we had one more question here for you. Yeah"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8695840","8702480"," Uh trader podcast do you ever look at central bank liquidity injection charts? Nope"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8703920","8707280"," Uh, so maybe he's peaking hopefully he's peaking your interest in those"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","8721520","8726480"," Some wondering if any of you do as well and how their how their timing doesn't always coincide with"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8727040","8730160"," uh, they kind of sometimes inverse with uh with"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8730880","8732880"," the stock market"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8732880","8736320"," Anybody else out there follow those fed liquidity charts"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","8763840","8767760"," Liquidity injection is and all that the thing is I kind of like looked at that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8767760","8772880"," but I found a better signal was to just keep an eye on dixie and keep an eye on yields because"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8774480","8778320"," What is that they use for liquidity injection is usually treasuries"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8779120","8783040"," Right. Yeah rates are going to get impacted and the dollar is going to get impacted"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8783040","8789360"," And that's a much more tradable signal than just looking at oh and then the thing is you you get to know it about it after the fact"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8789680","8795920"," But you'll be able to see the dollar and the yields change and give you a better trade signal like right up front"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8796080","8798080"," So that's why I don't even look at those charts anymore"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8801440","8803440"," Uh, we haven't see so"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8804160","8810800"," Talking monkey saying asked trader podcast if he ever uses trend seems like an index indicator right up as alley"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8811760","8812960"," and then uh"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","8876080","8877120"," So"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8877120","8879120"," interestingly"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8879360","8884560"," Um, so so just looking at the chart right now. There is a lot of call buying happening"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8885200","8890320"," Uh longer data. So about 15 14.5 a 25 million in"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","8908160","8914960"," In my mind. We're also below its hedge wall at 138 and there's plenty of room to the upside to 140"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8915920","8917920"," This might not be a bad trade"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","8918880","8921200"," Let me look at some of its positioning"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","9023200","9024720"," And then I would expect that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9024720","9030960"," I would expect tesla going back up to be the signal one of the easy signals to look for for the role in the marketplace"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9031760","9035040"," Once it rejoins, uh s&p 500 and, uh, cues"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9037600","9042240"," Uh, david am s right now saying just watch the chart of any index between 2 and 8 p.m"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","9403040","9408240"," Did you get did you give me this uh, I think you gave me access to this indicator didn't you or one of these or no"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9408800","9410960"," I gave you pivots. Yeah, I gave you my indicator"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9411680","9418000"," Um, and then there's another indicator. I'm working on I should show that on stream one of these one of these days in a slow day"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9418000","9422320"," We should go through and watch look at that indicator. Yeah, so what it's basically doing"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9422400","9425760"," So right now I have the smp e mini features up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9426800","9428000"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9428000","9434880"," Because I've been trading futures a fair bit. I'm not going to do any trading on screen because I don't want to get distracted"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9435520","9437920"," Uh, but it's a really cool indicator"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9438400","9442240"," Uh, it puts up all these ranges and pivots"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9442240","9447040"," And then I have a swing indicator that I've gotten off of trading due for swing high lows"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9447520","9449920"," And then there is a machine learning"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9450480","9454640"," Uh, algo that I've been using on a longer time frame"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9455600","9456800"," And it paints"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9456800","9461360"," By candles and cell signals for me. I'm working on it a little bit more"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9461840","9466320"," Trying to fine tune it before like I really start using it, but I did buy this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9467360","9471360"," Um in the morning this like giant squeeze up and I've sold"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9471920","9475920"," Uh, right around mark. Uh, the way this is not today's this is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9476800","9478560"," Yeah"

"k4ebLbMLw-E","9483120","9484320"," signal"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9484320","9486160"," Um for me"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9486160","9490720"," Earlier in the day and I ended up basically buying this candle and selling it like right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9491200","9494160"," So, which was like a nice amount of change on es"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9494960","9496960"," Yeah"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9498640","9503520"," No, no, it's just um, uh, that's something I'm working on and then you know, like I'll I'll make"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9504080","9511440"," Once your the website is done and it's ready and the system is ready. I'll I'll try and make these available for everybody else to use too"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9511520","9513920"," I like to eat them. It makes the screen a little bit busy"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9514560","9519520"," I don't have the trigger on right now because of some technical stuff and I'm sure I'll get it"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9520080","9521920"," You have not not wing wing cap"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9523600","9525600"," the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9526320","9530160"," Uh, well, I've got some people's I got a whole but I'm reading a bunch of stuff back here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9530640","9534560"," Uh, because so pico said thank you thirst and how the third asked about"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9535280","9541120"," Is asking about xbi your thoughts on xxbi and just john wanted to say"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9541760","9544320"," Uh, that they took the google trade and you please let"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9544880","9547760"," Uh, uh, trader podcast know that I said thank you if you get a sec"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9548400","9551680"," He filled it 65 cents. So just john saying thank you"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9552160","9556240"," Thirston hell the third asking about and this is all from the discord. Uh, they're asking"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9557120","9561200"," Uh about xbi. So if you could look that one up he'd appreciate that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9562000","9564320"," Definitely and cap do you remember"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9565040","9570080"," Last time I was on the show in december and I talked about watch xbi and iwm"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9570640","9574880"," xbi is my trade xbi has been my trade since the mid since $73"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9575440","9576400"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9576400","9579360"," Today you're seeing a bunch of call selling. This is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9580480","9583120"," Monetization, it's above $100 guys like it's run"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9583760","9588240"," Pretty hot and today yields are a little bit up. So you do expect this kind of selling"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9588720","9590720"," But people are buying"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9590960","9592960"," One dke calls on it"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9593680","9597200"," Today, there's been 18 million of zero dte call delta"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9597920","9606320"," But overall call delta is minus 28 million so net that out. That's negative 48 million of call selling"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9607760","9611280"," So i negative 46 million of call selling that's happened today"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9612240","9614960"," On xbi that's in my mind. It's monetization"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9615520","9618480"," Because just look where we are and if we look at it's uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9621760","9623760"," It's put call impact"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9624240","9629600"," You know, it's call walls at 104. Look at this this stick at 105. That's right up there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9629600","9632880"," And the only reason 104 is right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9633440","9640000"," Uh, the call wall and not 105 is just because it's a little bit of put delta. I really like seeing that I"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9641360","9643360"," There's definite room for"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9643840","9647200"," Upwards movement put wall is at 101"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9648800","9656560"," And which is also very very interesting because that would be a dip to buy like it dips down to 101"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9658640","9660800"," Slam calls two weeks out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9660800","9666000"," Probably for 104 and you'll end up at 105 so you'll make some money on on top of that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9666320","9667840"," uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9667840","9669840"," I do want to also caution that if"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9670800","9672320"," You see this blue line"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9672400","9676000"," You see how it gets really steep from like 101 to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9677120","9681840"," Uh like right about here 99 that means if 101 breaches"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9683920","9687040"," It's going to be just because of the amount of put gamma that is here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9687040","9692240"," It's going to get really whippy towards like 99 very very very quickly"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9692960","9694960"," so something to be"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9695040","9697040"," Uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9697040","9698640"," cautious of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9698720","9702880"," But they're selling volatility across the board IV on xbi is high"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9702960","9707360"," So they're selling it which is kind of good implied volatility at the moment"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9708160","9709360"," Uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9709360","9710960"," Is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9710960","9713200"," That doesn't seem right. What's xbi trading today?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9715680","9718880"," So sorry, I wasn't I'm on the over here doing something else"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9719600","9724240"," So it's a 99 already. Yeah, this is a dip to buy in my mind"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9725280","9728240"," That's crazy. It's squeezed up today to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9729360","9730560"," 103"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9730560","9734160"," 40 ish almost and then it's kind of giving all that up"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9734640","9738640"," uh towards the end of the day. I will probably be looking to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9741120","9743680"," To maybe buy some calls two weeks out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9744880","9748400"," So right all this all this red down here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9749600","9751840"," Uh tells me they're willing to sell puts on it"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9752160","9756960"," So it kind of makes sense from what we saw earlier and lastly, let's look at the risk reversal"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9757920","9760960"," Uh, no, I'm going to look at history instead"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9763360","9769600"," There's more puts expiring next week. Uh, so tomorrow than there are calls by about 2 percent"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9770160","9773120"," It's not that big how much is the put call ratio put call"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9774560","9776560"," ratio is not that"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9776800","9778400"," uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9778400","9780400"," Not that great"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9780880","9782880"," Yeah, it's okay"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9783120","9786400"," I would still feel good. I would want it to like stay above"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9786800","9789840"," 99.13 if I look at my chart"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9790560","9792320"," on xbi"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9792320","9798000"," Uh, big C keeps popping its head up. So that's interesting on xbi. We are"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9799680","9806000"," Technically at max extension to the downside just based on a 60 day look back"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9807200","9808400"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9808400","9811680"," And where the edges should be so this is kind of where we should see support"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9812960","9814960"," And I would like for the support to hold"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9815520","9820560"," Uh before entering a trade. I would like for it to get above 99.45"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9821440","9826000"," And kind of hold there before like I like plug in a trade for for two weeks out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9828960","9830960"," All right, any other questions?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9831600","9835760"," Um chop chop chop one-on-one looks like negative gex level"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9836800","9839120"," We have one more that I promised I would ask"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9839360","9842400"," Uh, and I was just looking at the chart a moment ago"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9843200","9847840"," Uh, this is a good question. Um, can you there's someone's asking because I've been here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9847840","9852000"," I've been stuck in a stock before and it's no fun, right?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9852000","9858000"," I've got real good foods stuck in that trade right now and uh, so I'm going to ask this one last one for you"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9859520","9860720"," Uh"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9860720","9862720"," Hold on here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9862960","9867600"," That lee on youtube is asking about vfc"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9869360","9874960"," I believe the technicals have recovered it looks like it's been consolidating for some period of time"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9875440","9881520"," Has gotten torched. I don't know if you can take a look at that ticker. Yeah. Yeah, I can see if what all is available"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9882560","9884560"," Kind of turns these off"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9885520","9887520"," Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9889200","9897200"," Chart does look like it's consolidating in a fairly tight range. Uh, it's a two dollar range of up $16 stock. So that's kind of"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9898000","9900000"," not that tight"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9900560","9902800"," But it's good for volatility. Let's see"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9911040","9913840"," I love to draw some lines, but that just like from"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9917760","9919760"," That the kind of looks like a"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9921040","9926160"," Like a falling wedge and then it's going sideways off of it. Yeah, I'd have to look at it. Um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9927680","9933120"," VFC, right? Yeah, I think I got this I think I got this one right here. There's a couple"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9934000","9939120"," Um, let me see if I can actually don't have data for that at all. Yeah, let me take a peak here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9942720","9945680"," Yeah, it looks I like it here. I mean I like the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9946240","9950640"," It looks like the same kind of a thing here for i'm looking at it right now and it just looks like"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9951440","9953440"," uh sideways consolidation"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9953920","9955920"," It looks like it's trying to"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9955920","9957920"," wear out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9958240","9960240"," Trapped sellers, right? It's um"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9961920","9968240"," You got that move right there. You can see I can see it just right down here on uh from a volat for sake of velocity"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9968640","9972320"," Had a low back here in october had just came off another low back here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9972960","9977120"," And uh february of 2024 and i think the assumption here is going to get"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9977680","9980480"," Uh one more drive higher and to the right"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9981280","9984240"," There's no the one is there not an issue with this, but"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9984960","9988960"," Uh, this is a 30-minute time frame, but we're just looking at it on a daily time frame"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9990000","9997600"," Right here. The one issue that you have here on this ticker in particular is you've got trap buyers"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","9998400","10004640"," From $84 and the expectation from them is yeah, we're going to bring it all back. That's likely not the case"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10005280","10010560"," Uh, you might get back to 30. I mean I would be I'd be looking for first for"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10011200","10014560"," 1753 and I wouldn't even be taking a long here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10015040","10019120"," Unless you get some kind of a confirmation trade. I'm going to blow this up for you right now"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10019760","10026240"," Uh dat Lee. I want to show you something here. Okay, it's really quick here like fundamental easy trading stuff"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10026640","10030560"," This is a daily candle on bfc, right? They broke above the"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10031520","10036640"," They broke above the weekly trigger here. What they did not do is confirm the upside move"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10037280","10040560"," So immediately on that back test on the daily trigger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10041200","10044240"," You need to see that new high right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10045040","10047280"," To get confidence back"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10047280","10049920"," You'd see the daily trigger come up again"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10050640","10055120"," And then you would come off that daily trigger and ride that trade to the upside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10055120","10060880"," So when you say anything out there like I think we're done or I think we're going to have a breakout and upside"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10061280","10063520"," You want to see this stuff here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10064480","10068400"," Uh before you make that statement before you say hey, I think we're done"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10068960","10072160"," Uh, you'd want to see this price action that I'm showing you right there"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10072160","10074960"," So let me draw it out for you one more time. You want to think I snip of this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10075520","10079600"," Uh, you're more than welcome welcome to at home. So you'd see this"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10080480","10083440"," This yellow line would break above the orange line, right?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10084000","10088800"," You'd see the back test so you'd start here with the green, right? You get the squeeze above"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10089760","10093280"," You always want to see the successful back test"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10093760","10095920"," So that's right here, right?"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10095920","10098480"," And then the next part that you want to see is"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10099360","10102400"," Right here. You actually want to see this before you even take a trade"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10102800","10107760"," You don't want to see this roll. You want to see the breaking of a new high right here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10108400","10113760"," And you're still not in that trade. You're actually going to take that trade on the hourly trigger"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10114560","10116960"," Uh when that hourly trigger comes up over here"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10116960","10122720"," You can actually then enter your trade and say hey looks like corrections over and we're going to start knocking out"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10123360","10129440"," Uh all of those previous highs all of this stuff up here the stuff at $22"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10129680","10131680"," The stuff at $25"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10132160","10137680"," The stuff at $29 and currently where we are your price target is 30"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10138000","10139440"," 68"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10139440","10142480"," So not $89 not 90, but 30"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10143200","10144560"," See you"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10144640","10149200"," Yeah, I know but I'm not showing that screen. Oh, there you go. What"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10152080","10154960"," Are you still free there dude, I think are"
"k4ebLbMLw-E","10157360","10159360"," Oh wait a minute"
