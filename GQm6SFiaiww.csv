"GQm6SFiaiww","0","19920"," Alright, let's see if this works."
"GQm6SFiaiww","19920","33920"," This might work."
"GQm6SFiaiww","33920","35920"," Good morning, Angie."
"GQm6SFiaiww","35920","38920"," Good morning, you're a boomer."
"GQm6SFiaiww","38920","43920"," How's this feed?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","43920","46920"," Good morning, Binky."
"GQm6SFiaiww","46920","50920"," It's weird, so I don't have everything set up this morning, but I do."
"GQm6SFiaiww","50920","56920"," I don't have a monitor on to watch the live feed on YouTube."
"GQm6SFiaiww","56920","62920"," But I can see your texts still waiting for some more equipment to arrive in the mail."
"GQm6SFiaiww","62920","68920"," Everything has been coming in slowly."
"GQm6SFiaiww","68920","72920"," Good morning, your wife's boyfriend. Good morning, Al."
"GQm6SFiaiww","72920","79920"," Yeah, so I have a bunch of equipment coming in the mail, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","79920","83920"," UPS, post office."
"GQm6SFiaiww","83920","86920"," Half of it's here, half of it's not."
"GQm6SFiaiww","86920","88920"," So I've got some monitor."
"GQm6SFiaiww","88920","91920"," I'm kind of jury rigging some of this stuff right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","91920","100920"," I've got some webcam set up because I have some interface for three different monitors."
"GQm6SFiaiww","100920","102920"," So we can have a heat map on."
"GQm6SFiaiww","102920","104920"," You can see my face."
"GQm6SFiaiww","104920","107920"," And you can also see the candlestick charts."
"GQm6SFiaiww","107920","115920"," And I also want to live trade with you, but I need this other equipment."
"GQm6SFiaiww","115920","118920"," Good morning to everybody. Good morning, CJ, Chaz."
"GQm6SFiaiww","118920","120920"," Good morning in light productions."
"GQm6SFiaiww","120920","123920"," Raptor, a little big bear."
"GQm6SFiaiww","123920","124920"," Good morning, MA."
"GQm6SFiaiww","124920","129920"," We still have got, so Tesla."
"GQm6SFiaiww","129920","134920"," We were talking about Tesla on Friday that it was kind of do or die, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","134920","138920"," We know that if Tesla slips underneath that iceberg,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","138920","145920"," we're going to be seeing the low 900s, possibly 800s, even lower."
"GQm6SFiaiww","145920","147920"," Good morning, Brandy."
"GQm6SFiaiww","147920","152920"," So things should get, the production value should go up in the coming week."
"GQm6SFiaiww","152920","155920"," I guess I've got some stuff still lost in transit."
"GQm6SFiaiww","155920","160920"," This camera that I have on right now is not the camera that I want to be using."
"GQm6SFiaiww","160920","163920"," I've got a Sony A6000 that's coming in."
"GQm6SFiaiww","163920","168920"," So I'll have multiple cameras and multiple displays for you as the week moves forward."
"GQm6SFiaiww","168920","173920"," Good morning, Oliver. Good morning, Chase. Good morning, F-fisted."
"GQm6SFiaiww","173920","180920"," Why aren't you guys able to see my face and then I want to be able to put the heat map up for you,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","180920","182920"," candlestick charts, all that kind of stuff."
"GQm6SFiaiww","182920","191920"," And I'm trying to get, I've got a bunch of light lighting and stuff and some other lighting is missing right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","191920","194920"," What blew up?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","194920","198920"," Yeah, Tesla blew up like crazy."
"GQm6SFiaiww","198920","200920"," You kind of knew it on Friday. You didn't really have a choice."
"GQm6SFiaiww","200920","204920"," I didn't know if I was talking to Joe Donut."
"GQm6SFiaiww","204920","207920"," I think he stayed in his calls."
"GQm6SFiaiww","207920","209920"," My Tesla calls burned."
"GQm6SFiaiww","209920","214920"," And I had to make a choice in the day. I'm like, am I going to buy Tesla calls or spy calls?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","214920","217920"," And I wound up buying spy calls."
"GQm6SFiaiww","217920","221920"," And those are going to print stupid too anyways. They were like $0.10."
"GQm6SFiaiww","221920","226920"," And then you figure right at the, right at the bell, there are Billy Byers at the bell this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","226920","231920"," And you've got low volume last week, low liquidity, low volume."
"GQm6SFiaiww","231920","235920"," This week, of course, everyone's going to get back into the market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","235920","241920"," The premium alone is going to blow up anybody in calls right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","241920","243920"," Yeah, GM."
"GQm6SFiaiww","243920","245920"," I haven't looked at GM yet."
"GQm6SFiaiww","245920","247920"," Oh, good morning, Mikey."
"GQm6SFiaiww","247920","250920"," Good morning, everybody. Yeah, we're almost getting there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","250920","255920"," The new setup is going to get better. I've got a better camera and I've got some interfaces between displays."
"GQm6SFiaiww","255920","260920"," Right now, I'm just, I just jury rigged a webcam on on book map this morning,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","260920","265920"," but you'll get an actual legit book map display at some point this week."
"GQm6SFiaiww","265920","271920"," I'm just missing a bunch of stuff still in the mail. So everything's kind of, kind of, you know,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","271920","275920"," I don't want to say it, but it's not, it's rigged up right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","275920","278920"," But we're going to, I'm going to get this started here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","280920","285920"," That's okay if you guys didn't buy into the clothes. The clothes is very dangerous on Friday."
"GQm6SFiaiww","285920","290920"," So myself, how I was positioned, I had some Tesla calls that I bought that in print."
"GQm6SFiaiww","290920","294920"," I knew they were going to die. There really wasn't much I could do with that."
"GQm6SFiaiww","294920","299920"," I held a spy hedge over the weekend for today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","299920","305920"," And as I was heading into the clothes, you know, other than being hedged, I didn't have anything."
"GQm6SFiaiww","305920","312920"," And it was scary at the end of the day on Friday. So what I wound up doing was checking both Tesla and spy."
"GQm6SFiaiww","312920","317920"," And I had to kind of wait what my best chances were if I was going to go along the market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","317920","323920"," So I ended up taking the spy calls. They were like 10 cents for ADC."
"GQm6SFiaiww","323920","330920"," I figured if we did go up that the premium would kick in and that's happening this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","330920","334920"," So what happened was we talked about this ad nauseam last week, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","334920","336920"," We said that there was a giant hedge coming off the market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","336920","339920"," It's the largest one in history, I think."
"GQm6SFiaiww","339920","349920"," And it was a major put hedge that was on the market. And just that rolling off this morning, you can see the effects, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","349920","357920"," Yeah, a ton of gamma, a ton of gamma. And I don't want to call it negative gamma, but it was a lot of put gamma that rolled off the market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","357920","361920"," It was more than we've ever had."
"GQm6SFiaiww","361920","369920"," So if you call followed me on those calls, congratulations this morning or at least, you know, don't count your chickens, someone said on Twitter."
"GQm6SFiaiww","369920","378920"," I'm nervous about it myself. Trust me, because there's, we've got some things. We've got some resistance above pre-market at 478."
"GQm6SFiaiww","378920","384920"," What's crazy is the rail sellers have come in above at 495 or something and saying like that."
"GQm6SFiaiww","384920","389920"," I don't know that we get up there today. Let me see if they're still there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","389920","394920"," I'm nervous myself this morning. So we get some weird like sellers above at 487."
"GQm6SFiaiww","394920","399920"," I don't know if anybody on Twitter said mentioned 487 at all this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","399920","407920"," And we had sellers above on Friday at 480. We do have some sellers right now this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","407920","414920"," They kicked in around seven eight o'clock this morning, but I can't tell you exactly what's going to take place at the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","414920","423920"," I know that we have, you can see above here, 47788 is where the next small resistance is."
"GQm6SFiaiww","423920","428920"," But we've got some different numbers coming in this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","428920","434920"," Now, we haven't implied a move today of 33 points. Be aware of that."
"GQm6SFiaiww","434920","440920"," I don't know if that means that we kick in at the bell and just green bars straight up north."
"GQm6SFiaiww","440920","444920"," You know that people are going to want to buy this coming off the bell seeing Tesla where it's at."
"GQm6SFiaiww","444920","449920"," You know, people are going to want to buy it. 33 points is a big move."
"GQm6SFiaiww","449920","456920"," We talked last week about going up into the close, right? Pitting the 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","456920","466920"," And then possibly it happening on Monday, right? Do we crash? Do we pin 480 on Friday and then dump into Monday to pick it back up, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","466920","472920"," That didn't happen. So you can see that we're, we're pinning on Monday or today, right? We're pinning today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","472920","479920"," And so the question becomes, do we slam into that 480 and then start the sell off today?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","479920","485920"," So things could get volatile today. I want you to know that the day could be volatile today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","485920","489920"," I can't tell you if you should sell your calls at the bell or not."
"GQm6SFiaiww","489920","494920"," I think I think I want to hold mine to 478 at least."
"GQm6SFiaiww","494920","501920"," But if we went up above 478, let's say we went up to 480 or even higher because there are some higher numbers showing themselves this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","501920","508920"," I mean, the print would be insane. And the premium that would kick in today would be insane."
"GQm6SFiaiww","508920","514920"," Yeah, so 48793. We didn't have that number last week at all."
"GQm6SFiaiww","514920","517920"," So that's a big question off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","517920","524920"," Or maybe you take profit, look for a dip to grab to head higher if you're bullish this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","524920","533920"," And as we get closer to the 930 hour, we'll know more."
"GQm6SFiaiww","533920","539920"," Yeah, some hedge fund bought for 474 right after the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","540920","551920"," Yeah, I don't, so the thing is that we have to remember is that the thing that we have to remember is that it's hard to, it's complicated to try to explain."
"GQm6SFiaiww","551920","562920"," Even if they're buying these puts after the bell, the vast, the amount of gamma that was on this market was, it's just, it's so much more than you."
"GQm6SFiaiww","562920","567920"," And then you could buy that many puts after the bell, but we would have seen it. It would have looked like a cascade."
"GQm6SFiaiww","567920","572920"," This was the effect that took place earlier in December in parts of November this year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","572920","581920"," All that stuff came off on Friday and it does impact the market. You can see it this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","581920","585920"," Well, I've got puts just so you know, I've got puts."
"GQm6SFiaiww","585920","593920"," I'm going to hope that they expire today and I have a, there's a, there's a small chance that my calls are going to print and my puts are going to print today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","593920","595920"," So I don't know what that means."
"GQm6SFiaiww","595920","599920"," This today, it's going to be a wild day. We all know it's going to be a wild day."
"GQm6SFiaiww","599920","603920"," I want to talk to you guys about a few things though, okay, before we get into the day."
"GQm6SFiaiww","603920","612920"," I have to cut this live stream short before the bell this morning and I'll put just a book map live stream up for you at the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","612920","616920"," So I need, I have some information I need to get out to that I meant to get out to yesterday."
"GQm6SFiaiww","616920","619920"," And I wasn't able to set and all this stuff up."
"GQm6SFiaiww","619920","623920"," So it's important, I want you guys to realize some stuff, okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","623920","626920"," And I haven't seen much talk about this on the internet."
"GQm6SFiaiww","626920","631920"," I think it's critical information that you need as an investor and as a trader."
"GQm6SFiaiww","631920","635920"," So if you guys want to strap in real quick, I just want to talk to you about a few things, okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","635920","642920"," Well, you all, if you're a perma bear, right, like market crash perma bear, this might not be the video for you."
"GQm6SFiaiww","642920","653920"," If you are a bear or bull or theta gang, if you think like, if you think, if you think this year, we can trade slightly up or sideways or even slightly down, this video is for you."
"GQm6SFiaiww","653920","662920"," If you are the kind of guy that's like, or woman or man or whatever, that's like, we're going to go down, we're going to trade down to 200 this year, this video might not be for you."
"GQm6SFiaiww","662920","670920"," But if you think we can trade sideways, have a small profit in the year, even if we trade down, you know, which should encompass most of you out there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","670920","681920"," I want to talk to you guys about all the four, excuse me, all the forecasting that's done out there, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","681920","684920"," You've got forecasts all over the place."
"GQm6SFiaiww","685920","696920"," I want to talk to you about most years, like the last 10 years, last 15 years, outside of a market crash, a legitimate crash, which nobody can predict."
"GQm6SFiaiww","696920","706920"," Most years, if you were, I'm on the, the E-mini right now, it doesn't matter if you're an SPX or spy or whatever, but if you just go back and look at each year, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","706920","708920"," So this is the beginning of 2020."
"GQm6SFiaiww","708920","715920"," And you can see at some point in 2020, we had some downtime in February and March, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","715920","727920"," So let's say you're an investor, let's say you're a bull, you're going to get a chance to go long at some points between now and March."
"GQm6SFiaiww","727920","732920"," You will have one of the lowest points in the market per year in that timeframe."
"GQm6SFiaiww","732920","741920"," If we did not the previous year, trade down in the months of September, October, November, December, let's say, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","741920","751920"," So if we had a huge down movement the previous year, this is going back to the 2000s, like 2007, 2008, all these times, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","751920","761920"," You're going to get a chance between now and February, March to enter the market, regardless if we dump like we did in March, 2020."
"GQm6SFiaiww","761920","769920"," Regardless if we trade sideways this year, or if we even just show a little bit of profit on the year and the S&P 500."
"GQm6SFiaiww","769920","776920"," You have to know that there's no place to, with inflation, there's no place to put money, except for equities."
"GQm6SFiaiww","776920","785920"," The S&P 500, the NASDAQ, the IWM, these are places that you can keep your money and at least be inflation."
"GQm6SFiaiww","785920","792920"," So let's just say, we look back, right. You can see in 2020, we had this big dump over here, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","792920","796920"," This was back in February, and we still came up that year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","796920","802920"," I want to show you previous years just so you can get an idea of what I'm talking about here, okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","802920","806920"," Now you can see we had this huge sell down back here in 2018, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","806920","810920"," This was just relentless selling down, and we did wind up going up for the year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","810920","819920"," We had one small time in May where we were down again, but if you'd bought this dip from the previous year, you would have been fined for 2018."
"GQm6SFiaiww","819920","824920"," I also want to show you guys, in 2018, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","824920","829920"," So let's say you were one of the way to be an investor, way to be a buyer of this market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","829920","838920"," You would have still missed this initial run in January, but you would have had your chance to buy the real bottom in the market in February of 2018."
"GQm6SFiaiww","838920","849920"," And this plays itself out every year. You go back every single year, and you'll find that if we didn't dump the year before, which we didn't dump this year, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","849920","855920"," That there's a spot here in February. There's another spot here in April that you could have caught a bottom and rode this up."
"GQm6SFiaiww","855920","865920"," And you'll notice that if you go back, and I'm not going to go back with you in video here, but if you start, if you start putting some vertical lines in your charts for every year going back to the, to the odds, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","865920","879920"," Last 20 years, you'll find that if we didn't sell off the fall and winter leading up to the new year, right, which we didn't this year, that there's a dip that comes in February, March in that timeframe."
"GQm6SFiaiww","879920","887920"," So, from that perspective, what you want to be doing right now is now, now, let's just say you're the market bear, right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","887920","891920"," So you'll see that dump between that huge dump you'll see between now and March."
"GQm6SFiaiww","891920","897920"," If you are a bull, you'll see somewhat of a dump, right, or some kind of a pullback in that same timeframe."
"GQm6SFiaiww","897920","913920"," Now, even if we trade sideways, like in 2015, 16 and 18, there were still those moments where we traded down on the market in springtime, like late winter, early spring, we sold down, and you could still grab that bottom to ride up, even if the market was sideways."
"GQm6SFiaiww","913920","921920"," Okay, then you would have been at the bottom of that rise, even if it was a sideways, slightly higher rise into end of year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","921920","934920"," So from now, being the first or the third of the year, right, I want you to think about when you're going to enter the market as an investor, we're going to just, we're going to make a basket of stocks that we think are going to go well for this year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","935920","937920"," We can, we can say IWM is going to go up."
"GQm6SFiaiww","937920","939920"," Yeah, I heard that all over the weekend, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","939920","942920"," Everyone in YouTube is talking about IWM, IWM, IWM."
"GQm6SFiaiww","942920","947920"," In my view, IWM probably has one more dip left in it between now and February."
"GQm6SFiaiww","947920","951920"," So let's say you take a long right now in IWM, you don't want to miss it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","951920","954920"," Let's say a rocket ships up in January, I still think it's coming down one more time."
"GQm6SFiaiww","954920","956920"," I think that's for all the indexes."
"GQm6SFiaiww","956920","963920"," And so just, if you're going to be a prudent investor this year, and you want to, you want to be safe in your investments this year, for me at least,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","963920","968920"," to take along, I'm going to be looking at a basket of stocks that look attractive to me, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","968920","971920"," You're going to pick the ones that you like out there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","971920","976920"," And if you want to be more aggressive and say I'm buying this right off the gate in January, that's fine."
"GQm6SFiaiww","976920","982920"," But for me as an investor, I'm going to wait for that aspect of my investing until February."
"GQm6SFiaiww","982920","988920"," Or if we sell that in January, February or March, I know at some point in these next three months there will be a bottom."
"GQm6SFiaiww","988920","990920"," I don't know how deep it is."
"GQm6SFiaiww","990920","992920"," The bears say it's down to 400."
"GQm6SFiaiww","992920","995920"," I don't, let's say it is at 400."
"GQm6SFiaiww","995920","999920"," If I wait to buy my stock at 400, I'm going to have a great year, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","999920","1000920"," No matter what."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1000920","1006920"," And I can't take on that, but I can't take on that market crash perspective as an investor."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1006920","1007920"," I'll never be able to time it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1007920","1009920"," The only thing that I can do is buy hedges, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1009920","1011920"," I can buy, there's all kinds of hedges you can buy."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1011920","1016920"," If I buy volatility hedges, you can buy three month out, three month out, put spreads."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1016920","1018920"," You can do it day by day weekly."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1018920","1020920"," We've talked about that at Nazim as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1020920","1022920"," But until that changes, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1022920","1026920"," Even if we traded down to 400 in March, I would still want to buy that bottom in March, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1026920","1029920"," We know what to look for for reversal signs."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1029920","1035920"," And if we do see those reversal signs in March or February or whatever, I'm going to pick that up with some investments with stock."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1035920","1039920"," And so in the coming week, we're going to talk about a basket of stocks."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1039920","1044920"," We're going to do some live streams where I can chart out the ones that you want to add to your basket."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1044920","1047920"," I'm going to show you the ones that I'm adding to my basket."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1047920","1048920"," Okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1048920","1050920"," Let's talk about some other stuff."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1050920","1052920"," Okay, I'm going to get off that topic real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1052920","1053920"," Okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1053920","1057920"," We've had the stealth correction in 2021."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1057920","1061920"," We also have a few major stocks holding the stock market up."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1061920","1063920"," It wouldn't surprise me to see."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1063920","1064920"," We talked about that too, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1064920","1072920"," You might see those stocks start to sell off the apples and the tassels, anything that the bonds are being bought in."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1072920","1077920"," We hear about the tapering, the aggressive tapering is going to happen into March, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1077920","1081920"," It's going to get aggressive in March so that we can start rate increases."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1081920","1083920"," None of that's changed right now, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1083920","1086920"," We talked about in December and you know, we're now up to what?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1086920","1090920"," Nine trillion dollars being poured into the market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1090920","1093920"," You know, you know that it's not, it hasn't happened yet."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1093920","1101920"," So when that starts to come into play in February, March, that's what I'm going to expect that pullback that we're looking for to grab that bottom."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1101920","1105920"," We're going to be getting along this market investment in stock buying actual stock."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1105920","1113920"," Otherwise, we're going to, I'm going to play this market from that from January right now into into February, March until we find that bottom."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1113920","1123920"," And then I'll deployment my cash that way in stock and stock buying."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1123920","1124920"," Yeah."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1124920","1125920"," Yeah."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1125920","1133920"," You remember, that's the other thing. So let's say today we trade up to 478 or let's say today we trade up to 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1133920","1141920"," You have to look at, I want you guys to always be, I want you guys to always be looking at this market as a trader and not as a bull and a bear."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1141920","1150920"," You have to look at what is our upside potential right now as a bull versus our downside potential as a bear, right? The markets go up, they come down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1150920","1158920"," We know that the markets markets can trade irrationally and climb the wall of fear."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1158920","1161920"," We know that can happen this week or today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1161920","1166920"," But in reality, are we going to 500 this week or this month? Probably not."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1166920","1172920"," There are some weird numbers coming out today of like 489, 493, 493."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1172920","1174920"," I don't think we get there right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1174920","1177920"," Even if we get up, let's say up to 480 today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1177920","1183920"," That's the time to take the money and run and wait for entry to go short this market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1183920","1185920"," I don't know if that happens up the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1185920","1193920"," I don't know if the FOMO kicks in today, the send us up to 487 or 48, you know, whatever that I'll show you the new numbers here in a minute."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1193920","1199920"," But you want to look to be capturing the big moves and not trying to fight for money."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1199920","1203920"," You noticed last week that I lost money trying to fight for scraps, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1203920","1205920"," We're looking for 10, 20 points."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1205920","1214920"," At some point, I should just be sitting out right now and waiting for us to pull back a little bit because if I can catch that pull back, I don't need it all."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1214920","1216920"," I just need a part of it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1216920","1219920"," And that was the same thing when we were making this run up, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1219920","1223920"," This last run up that we just made, we made a lot of money on that run."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1223920","1226920"," And we'll make a lot of money when it pulls back as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1226920","1228920"," So am I going to be looking to go short?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1228920","1233920"," I'm going to be watching a book map today to see where the rejection is, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1233920","1236920"," Does rejection come at 478, 480?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1236920","1238920"," Has it come at 483?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1238920","1239920"," We're going to know too."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1239920","1250920"," You're going to see, you usually see rejection is much different than it was the run up right into last a week ago or seven trading days ago."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1250920","1254920"," You saw that we didn't ricochet right off rejection."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1254920","1256920"," We started to consolidate off it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1256920","1259920"," We traded down slightly and now you can see where we are on Monday."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1259920","1262920"," So we'll be looking for that to take a short."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1262920","1268920"," If any of you guys want to get bearish at some point, when we want to get real bearish and I'm going to lean into it, you guys will know."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1268920","1271920"," I'll tell you guys, hey, we're at a rejection point here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1271920","1278920"," So we're at a localized top and we're going to start trading down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1278920","1281920"," So what else are you guys saying?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1281920","1283920"," Yeah, fighting for scraps in reality."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1283920","1286920"," I mean, I don't, that's part of my poison, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1286920","1289920"," That's the gambling side of this market as a trader."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1289920","1299920"," If I just took, you guys, if you check my earlier videos out, I show you guys 9, 10, 12 places on the bottom to buy and 9, 12, 12 places to short at the top, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1299920","1304920"," If you do that every single month or so, you wouldn't have a losing trade."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1304920","1310920"," Other than timing that trade, you could have just taken spreads dated out and you just wouldn't lose."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1310920","1312920"," And that's really the same point right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1312920","1315920"," If you look at where we are in the market, we're going to fight over scraps."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1315920","1320920"," We find small trades, like the trade on Friday is a great trade."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1320920","1323920"," But in general, we're looking to go short at some point."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1323920","1327920"," And if you're a bull out there and you're thinking, no, we're going to go to 500 right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1327920","1328920"," I can't join you on it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1328920","1333920"," Even if we were to go to 500 right now, I wouldn't join you on that ride because it's too risky."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1333920","1339920"," And 9 times out of 10, we're not going to go that extra 200 points for where we are in the market right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1339920","1342920"," You're kind of looking for this gamma roll off right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1342920","1345920"," You're looking for a quick sprint up, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1345920","1348920"," Tag some nice high number and then we're going to start selling down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1348920","1350920"," That's my thought process, okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1350920","1352920"," Now, markets can change at any time."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1352920","1355920"," Anything can change and I'll change my viewpoint."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1355920","1358920"," But for where we are without the market being open right now,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1358920","1361920"," I'm going to look for some kind of FOMO today right off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1361920","1363920"," Traders, traders, investors, buyers."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1363920","1366920"," We know that the rest of the world is closed today, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1366920","1367920"," We know that we've got holidays."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1367920","1369920"," I hope you guys know there's banks closed."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1369920","1374920"," There's a stock market still closed all over the world celebrating holidays today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1374920","1378920"," So you know that bulls can take charge in a day like today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1378920","1382920"," You know you have all that gamma roll off today and you know people want to make some prints of money."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1382920","1385920"," And you know that there's some people stuck in positions right now, even in Tesla,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1385920","1388920"," they want to close out some of their positions for profit."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1388920","1392920"," And you're going to know that people are going to want to take profit at the beginning of the year too, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1392920","1395920"," All these winning positions from 2021,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1395920","1403920"," they're going to want to take some of that profit at the table and then reenter with new capital in the beginning of the year, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1403920","1406920"," At some point this year, you know some people are saying,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1406920","1410920"," hey, I'm going to take profit on my Tesla and I want to find a nice bottom."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1410920","1413920"," Now I'll join you down at 800, 750, 900 or whatever."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1413920","1416920"," Some Tesla bulls are going to say, no, we're going to 3000 this year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1416920","1417920"," That's fine too."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1417920","1425920"," But for me, for today, what I'm looking for is us to green bar it straight up for 78, 480,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1425920","1430920"," and well, as a matter of fact, I'll bring it back up for you guys right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1430920","1433920"," Some of these numbers we didn't see last week."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1433920","1435920"," And I'll show you right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1435920","1440920"," You've got sellers up here at 487, which is just wild."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1440920","1444920"," I'm pretty good at 47 today. I don't see 47, but it's showing it on book map, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1444920","1446920"," We didn't see this before."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1446920","1451920"," We are seeing a battle right now, right where we are at 47, 7.20."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1451920","1457920"," And we will watch this into the open on a different stream this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1457920","1464920"," You can see up here too, there's another, this is a light resistance above at 478.27."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1464920","1466920"," Do we catch that off the bell? I don't know."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1466920","1471920"," I don't know what to tell you guys. I know that what I'm in right now and I have to look to see,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1471920","1474920"," well, what I'm looking for off the bell is two things."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1474920","1479920"," They're looking for the calls to come to their right price, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1479920","1481920"," Like what are they supposed to be at?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1481920","1484920"," Sometimes it takes a few minutes for those to kick in off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1484920","1489920"," And then the second thing I'm looking for is premium kick and I'm looking for buyers to come into the market"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1489920","1492920"," and throw some premium on those calls as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1492920","1495920"," So you'll have two prices or three prices."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1495920","1497920"," The first price will be what the bell is."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1497920","1503920"," The second price will be the premium kick in and the third price will be the real price, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1503920","1507920"," Well, you've got real price on the premium kick in if there is, if the buyers step in."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1507920","1512920"," So we'll know that on, we'll know that on BookMap right when the bell hits this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1512920","1514920"," So I want to talk about that stuff."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1514920","1517920"," You've got the economic calendar this week. I'm sure everybody's talked to you about it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1517920","1520920"," The big thing this week is all about jobs."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1520920","1524920"," ADP, unemployment, we've got FOMC on Thursday."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1524920","1526920"," I think it's just the minutes."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1526920","1527920"," We'll take a look right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1527920","1529920"," It's on Wednesday at 2 p.m., right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1529920","1532920"," You know that's the usual setup for some volatility."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1533920","1537920"," But on Monday, we've got PMI, construction spending."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1537920","1539920"," That's all at 9.45."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1539920","1542920"," And this one says 19 a.m., I don't know what that means."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1542920","1545920"," But basically 9.45, we've got no volatility until then."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1545920","1549920"," Tuesday, we've got times for 10 a.m."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1549920","1552920"," for the manufacturing, job openings, job quits."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1552920","1556920"," So we've got a nice morning ahead of us on the economic calendar in that front."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1556920","1561920"," And then on Wednesday, we've got ADP and the FOMC meetings at 2 p.m."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1561920","1563920"," So let's call that our most volatile day this week."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1563920","1567920"," And then, of course, we've got initial claims and continuing claims."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1567920","1572920"," Now, we know that the job market is strong right now for employees getting new jobs."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1572920","1574920"," We know nothing's changed there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1574920","1579920"," I think from what I'm looking at out there that jobs are being filled,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1579920","1581920"," people are going back to work."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1581920","1590920"," We know that the Omicron, the Decepticon is being used flagrantly to move the market"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1590920","1593920"," and positive and negative directions."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1593920","1600920"," I don't know who to trust anymore when it comes to the COVID virus."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1600920","1602920"," I don't know what to tell you guys out there about it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1602920","1608920"," I know that it was used by one party and now it's being used by the other party."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1608920","1610920"," So now I don't trust either party, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1610920","1612920"," You really can't trust what's going on right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1612920","1618920"," I think that the message is maybe towards maybe geared towards unvaccinated people"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1618920","1621920"," and what they're doing is alienating vaccinated people."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1621920","1626920"," And then it's being picked up by people that want to use it, why the market's going up"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1626920","1628920"," and why the market's going down as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1628920","1630920"," So to me, it's a big cluster F."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1630920","1633920"," I don't know what to believe anymore when it comes to that stuff."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1633920","1635920"," I'm kind of lost."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1635920","1639920"," I don't know what you guys think out there, but I'm kind of lost in all this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1643920","1646920"," So you can buy the 479 call and sell the 480 call."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1646920","1647920"," Yeah, that's a great one."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1647920","1648920"," I like that one."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1651920","1654920"," Yeah, you guys are all talking inside the feed with how to play today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1654920","1658920"," You guys should discuss inside the chat how you're playing the open today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1658920","1662920"," I'm probably going to take some off the table right at the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1662920","1666920"," If I can get the right price, it might take 30 seconds or a minute and I'm probably"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1666920","1668920"," going to let some ride just based on this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1668920","1671920"," I really do want to see 478 or 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1671920","1674920"," I think that's where the pin is today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1676920","1678920"," We're going to move back to Webull real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1678920","1679920"," Real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1681920","1683920"," I'm going to get off ES here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1684920","1686920"," I like seeing this big buy in here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1686920","1687920"," See that gorgeous buy?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1687920","1688920"," What time was this at?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1690920","1691920"," 845."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1695920","1697920"," You can see that taking place right here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1697920","1701920"," There was a bid at 846.26."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1703920","1704920"," Excuse me."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1704920","1705920"," I probably need to drink some coffee."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1705920","1706920"," Give me just a second here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1712920","1716920"," So today, if you're by the dipper, I want to talk to you guys about being by the dippers"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1716920","1720920"," today that the cashback close was way down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1720920","1724920"," That was at 474.65."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1724920","1728920"," So if you're bullish, what are we looking for on the bell?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1728920","1731920"," I'm looking for 480 basically, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1731920","1733920"," I want to see that 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1733920","1734920"," I want to see that 480 tag."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1734920","1735920"," I'm going to show you guys."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1735920","1736920"," Let me see if I can get this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1739920","1741920"," So my price target is up here, 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1741920","1743920"," That's what I want to see off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1743920","1747920"," If I can't see this off the bell and you want to remain bullish,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1747920","1749920"," you're going to be looking to buy the dipper."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1749920","1751920"," I'll give you guys a couple places to buy the dip today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1762920","1766920"," So if you're bullish off the bell, if you're like me off the bell,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1766920","1769920"," I'm looking for, what do I say?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1769920","1771920"," So hold on a second here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1771920","1773920"," Let's put this other cell line up here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1773920","1776920"," 47829."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1776920","1783920"," Let's make this 47829."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1783920","1789920"," So we know we've got sellers hiding above here at 47829."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1789920","1793920"," So I'm going to be looking for a green bar above, tag this, take profit,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1793920","1795920"," and then look for a dip buy below if you're bullish."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1795920","1797920"," You make it 47576."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1797920","1799920"," This is a weak support."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1799920","1802920"," This is also weak support down below 47515."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1802920","1808920"," You really want to be a dip buyer down below if you're bullish at 474.65."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1808920","1815920"," Now if we start selling down immediately, I'll cut these calls loose and look for a grab down below to head higher to 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1815920","1820920"," And of course, we're going to watch the options flow this morning as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1820920","1826920"," If you want to turn bearish at this point, you're definitely going to be looking for a tag of 47829."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1826920","1833920"," If not a screaming high push above to, I think we called it, let's take a look on the heat map again."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1833920","1839920"," If you want to be a conservative bear, I know the second place to be grabbing."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1840920","1845920"," You're going to be shocked at this, but it's 48745."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1845920","1847920"," I don't even know if I'm going to, I'm not going to put this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1847920","1849920"," I'm not going to put that on here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1849920","1852920"," It's way up here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1852920","1854920"," I don't know if that's real."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1854920","1859920"," If I was a bear, I'd probably be taking, or you could do like a one, two, three pattern."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1859920","1863920"," You could start entering at 47829."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1864920","1868920"," Then maybe number two would be up here at 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1868920","1872920"," Seems logical that we try to trade up there that bulls would want to take it there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1872920","1876920"," And then your last entry would be in a reversal to 478."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1876920","1880920"," If we see 487, okay, it's possible."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1880920","1882920"," You know how this market trades, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1882920","1883920"," We always trade to the right."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1883920","1885920"," We never trade to the left."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1885920","1891920"," So it's possible we get up there, but if I was going to get bearish, I'd be looking for right off the bell is heading north"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1891920","1894920"," and looking for a firm resistance that we ricochet off."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1894920","1902920"," If you're, if you see a cell down in your bear, I wouldn't necessarily take this as being bearish coming down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1902920","1904920"," This is going to look to me like a dip by."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1904920","1915920"," If you want to get bearish and we're selling off right at the bell this morning, I would say wait for us to sell below 4750."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1915920","1919920"," Somewhere down in here, and if you see this breach down below,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1919920","1926920"," then you could possibly take a short or a long put and start trading us down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1926920","1930920"," You guys want to see where you take that, take that to the different levels."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1930920","1933920"," I can show you here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1933920","1936920"," Sorry about my mess this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1936920","1947920"," So if you're to see this break down below around 473 or 4750, between 4750 and 473.73,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1947920","1953920"," you'd be looking to take that down to 471.45."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1953920","1957920"," And then really below that, we're going to try to tag 460 down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1957920","1959920"," We're going to try to head much, much lower."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1959920","1962920"," Do I think we make it to 460?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1962920","1964920"," This has to be raised."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1964920","1966920"," I have to adjust all these things here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1966920","1969920"," Do I think we make it to 460?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1969920","1971920"," Probably not."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1971920","1976920"," I think we probably make it to 465ish somewhere in there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1976920","1979920"," So if your bearish starts where you're going to take,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1979920","1986920"," we'll rehash this for you once more, so that you guys all get a feel for the open this morning, okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1986920","1992920"," If we go up at the bell, you're looking for rejection off 47829."
"GQm6SFiaiww","1992920","1998920"," If you get this rejection off 47829, like if we ricochet off,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","1998920","2003920"," you're going to be looking to take a short down to this area down here,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2003920","2008920"," this 47401 or so, somewhere down in here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2008920","2011920"," You want to see, you can take this short, if it's going to come up,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2011920","2013920"," you can take this short down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2013920","2017920"," I would get out of it and reenter it once we break through 473."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2017920","2020920"," Or excuse me, 470."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2020920","2025920"," Once you break through 474.65, basically it's 475, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2025920","2031920"," You want to pick it up here, take it to 475, get out of it and see if they start to accumulate,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2031920","2034920"," or if we break through, then I'd pick it back up again."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2034920","2041920"," If you're a bear to, and you see us break through this 47829, or if we touch it and we start to consolidate,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2041920","2046920"," the next price target's 480, I would wait to take a short until we hit 480, or even above."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2046920","2050920"," But 480 would be a nice place if you're a conservative bear to take a short today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2050920","2052920"," Now, if you're a bull, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2052920","2055920"," If you hit a pair, same thing, take profit."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2055920","2060920"," If you see us starting to sell down right off the bell down here, to me, that's very bullish."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2060920","2065920"," If we start selling down over here, we haven't had a rejection yet in cash market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2065920","2073920"," Then I'm going to be looking to get out of my lungs here and pick it right back up to take this above again."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2073920","2076920"," I would expect too that we're not consolidating down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2076920","2080920"," If I see too much consolidating down here, I'll take a short here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2080920","2083920"," Two, three, four bounces, we just start trailing off."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2083920","2088920"," But if we come down here on the off the bell, I'm going to be looking to buy down below here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2088920","2091920"," At the cash gap close from Friday."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2091920","2096920"," Cash gap close on Thursday was at this 475, 76."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2096920","2098920"," So this is your buy the dipper zone down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2098920","2100920"," If we're right off the bell, that's where we're buying."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2100920","2105920"," If we go straight north right here, right off the bell, then you know where to pick up the short."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2105920","2111920"," You guys copying all that out there?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2111920","2114920"," Tesla up 77% in pre-market wild."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2115920","2117920"," Yeah, we talked about this on Friday."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2117920","2121920"," You guys know that we're talking about Tesla being a do or die kind of a thing."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2121920","2123920"," Let's actually look at ES right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2123920","2125920"," We're slightly dipping below here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2125920","2129920"," You know that this 4617, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2129920","2132920"," This is 465 right here, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2132920","2135920"," So you'd start to encounter a bottom at 465."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2135920","2137920"," You can see that down below here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2137920","2141920"," And you can see some light selling before we get out into ES."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2141920","2145920"," We start trading above and we trade above to this 47971."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2145920","2147920"," It is clear skies above."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2147920","2150920"," I'm going to show you NQ real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2150920","2155920"," And then I'm going to show you."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2155920","2161920"," I'll show you NQ, IWM."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2161920","2165920"," And then we'll look at Tesla real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2165920","2167920"," NQ's got a lot of work to do, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2167920","2169920"," And I'll show you this on the ES charts as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2169920","2172920"," We'll talk about the work that needs to be done on NQ."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2172920","2176920"," And does NQ have a lot of work to do?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2176920","2183920"," Does the S&P go up because other smaller ETFs within S&P 500 keep it up?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2183920","2185920"," And does NQ have work to do down below here?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2185920","2186920"," You can see this grind."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2186920","2188920"," You can see down below here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2188920","2196920"," We've got some marks down here, 16128, 5962."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2196920","2201920"," And then if we're down, here you might as well just come straight down to 15800, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2201920","2206920"," So the bear is going to be wanting to work on this today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2206920","2209920"," And so we're going to look to see if NQ fails today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2209920","2212920"," This might not make S&P though go down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2212920","2215920"," Be conscious of that, that there are other."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2215920","2220920"," You've got XLU, XLP that have been pumping like crazy."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2220920","2224920"," You've got semiconductors I want to take a look at if we have some time this morning"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2224920","2227920"," because it looks kind of toppy to me."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2227920","2228920"," Apple is looking toppy to me."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2228920","2232920"," You guys know all the tickers that are looking toppy out there, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2232920","2236920"," So we'll talk about NQ later this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2236920","2241920"," Let's look at IWM."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2241920","2244920"," Let's look at RTY."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2244920","2248920"," For all you."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2248920","2249920"," I like this chart."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2249920","2252920"," You guys, I see that I love this small cap chart."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2252920","2256920"," This is what gets me into trouble here because I'm looking at this chart right here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2256920","2261920"," And I'm like, man, I could totally see IWM small caps just rip higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2261920","2263920"," I could see it today right off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2263920","2265920"," This is probably the best looking chart out there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2265920","2268920"," It's probably the riskiest chart as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2268920","2272920"," Although it's usually when it's the best looking chart, it's more suspect."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2272920","2274920"," But I would be trying to play."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2274920","2281920"," I might close my spy calls here on the bell and see if IWM turns up if it does."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2281920","2283920"," So we're going to be looking for that 228."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2283920","2284920"," It's that same number."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2284920","2288920"," If we break through 228, we're going to start to squeeze shorts."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2288920","2291920"," And we'll have short squeezes all the way up to 240, I believe."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2291920","2293920"," I'll take a look at the charts back here in a minute."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2293920","2296920"," We'll take a look at the charts on trading view."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2296920","2302920"," And then we're going to look at Tesla real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2302920","2305920"," And we talked about Tesla."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2305920","2309920"," We were down here at 10, 20 or so, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2309920","2312920"," I think we're at 10, 11 or something like that."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2312920","2315920"," We're talking about how far can we come down here?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2315920","2319920"," And you can see this nice burg down below here at 1,011."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2319920","2322920"," Does it trade down to 1,011?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2322920","2323920"," Or do we trade above?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2323920","2327920"," We need to get above now 1,096 for clear skies."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2327920","2330920"," We have a lot of turbulence right now on Tesla."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2330920","2332920"," You can see this overnight."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2332920","2334920"," I think we're at 10, 90 in the overnight."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2334920","2335920"," It could be wrong on this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2335920","2337920"," I think that's where we were."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2337920","2339920"," When was this?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2339920","2342920"," I think this was the overnight last night, 10, 75."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2342920","2345920"," You really want to see us get above this and trade up."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2345920","2352920"," The price targets above are 10, 91.62 and 11, 17.01."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2352920","2357920"," If you're looking for a place to grab, grab a dip buy on Tesla today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2357920","2362920"," You're going to have snaps and lines on 10, 47, 96."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2362920","2366920"," And then a strong support down below here at 10, 10, 83."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2366920","2372920"," And if we ground through this area here, your next stop down below is going to be 952, 83."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2372920","2377920"," This is all just based on volume profile."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2377920","2382920"," Now we're going to look at, we're going to get off this real quick here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2382920","2385920"," I'm going to show you guys the charts on trading view."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2385920","2390920"," So we're going to bring trading view up here real quick."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2390920","2402920"," We're going to do this the second here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2402920","2407920"," It's going to take a minute to load up."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2407920","2411920"," You guys want to look at NQ right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2411920","2419920"," What I've got for charts and NQ."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2419920","2428920"," Hope you're all doing well out there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2428920","2430920"," Hope you all had a great new year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2430920","2437920"," Hope nobody caught a DWI or had anything terrible happen."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2437920","2453920"," And surprise, surprise, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2453920","2458920"," You see NQ working its way up over here and sitting right on top to go long."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2458920","2460920"," So I'm not bearish on NQ this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2460920","2465920"," My price target for NQ today is going to the first resistance going to be at 16, 639."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2465920","2468920"," It's actually a good trade if you're a bull."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2468920","2474920"," If you're a bear and you want to take this short here, you've got clear skies down to 15,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2474920","2475920"," 988."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2475920","2480920"," We've got a little bit of resistance at 16, 2, 6, 6, 16, 2, 3, 8."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2480920","2484920"," But this chart right here, it looks different than the volume profile this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2484920","2492920"," And you can see, look on the five day here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2492920","2495920"," You can see it's trying to fight its way back up today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2495920","2498920"," It'd be real cautious if you're a bear today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2498920","2502920"," This is setting up to make a rip much higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2502920","2507920"," You might want to keep the NQ chart open along with the VIX and the S&P."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2507920","2513920"," If you're going to short this market today, you really do want to see right off the bell NQ start selling off."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2513920","2519920"," If our NQ does not start selling off on the bell this morning, you're going to be looking for a rip higher today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2520920","2522920"," Absolutely without a doubt."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2522920","2526920"," And the price target's going to be 16, 639."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2526920","2531920"," This would move the spy up to that 480 number, possibly even higher today."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2531920","2534920"," This is going to be an interesting morning to watch off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2534920","2538920"," I would say to you keep, if you're a bull or a bear, I'd say keep NQ open."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2538920","2541920"," You want to see what the reaction is off the bell this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2541920","2548920"," You do know that on the 31st, put this one in for you guys."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2548920","2555920"," The low on the 31st was 16, 3, 1, 2."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2555920","2558920"," I wouldn't be taking this short until we break below 16."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2558920","2559920"," Well, I guess you could."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2559920","2560920"," Well, that's 100 points, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2560920","2561920"," How many points is that?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2561920","2562920"," Almost 100 points."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2562920","2567920"," I guess you could take this short down below if you're a bearish to 16, 3, 1, 2."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2567920","2573920"," But I would be careful of another buy to take it to 16, 639."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2573920","2575920"," So you're going to need to see the interplay on this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2575920","2580920"," As we open this morning, do we immediately trade higher?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2580920","2586920"," Or do we start trading back off the bell and look to see if support is found down below?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2586920","2588920"," Because this would do that same thing, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2588920","2594920"," If we come down on the spy, let's say, to the Friday close and then Q in the Friday close."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2594920","2601920"," And then you see buyers step in here and we take it up to the 16, 639."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2601920","2608920"," You would then see 480 on spy, at least, if not that 482 number that we're talking about earlier."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2608920","2612920"," We'll look at the IWM real quick and we'll look at Tesla."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2612920","2617920"," I don't think I have Tesla charted out on this chart currently."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2617920","2618920"," Maybe."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2618920","2619920"," I don't know."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2619920","2622920"," I don't think I'm charting that I remember right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2622920","2624920"," I think I'm charting RTY."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2625920","2629920"," So futures weirdos out there."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2629920","2637920"," You put Java traders."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2637920","2638920"," Yeah."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2638920","2643920"," So see when this is good to look at for you if you're a trader, okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2643920","2647920"," So when you're looking at the volume profile, everything looks great."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2647920","2649920"," The chart looks great on volume profile."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2650920","2658920"," But in reality, until we break above this or 2265, I can't take this long right here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2658920","2660920"," This is a localized top still."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2660920","2664920"," You saw we ricocheted off this morning at 2265."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2664920","2666920"," I really like to buy the dips down here, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2666920","2668920"," Like buying this down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2668920","2674920"," I don't mind buying this or this or this, but I don't like buying this right here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2674920","2678920"," So I'm going to take a wait and see approach on IWM."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2679920","2688920"," If we can get above 2265, I'll take that short run to 2288 and then look for a breakthrough"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2688920","2689920"," to take this much higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2689920","2692920"," If you guys see this breakthrough above here, whether you're a bull or a bear, if you see"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2692920","2694920"," this, this is a trade for you to take."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2694920","2698920"," You want to be taking that to 240, I think."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2698920","2702920"," Let me bring this back a little farther back time frame here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2703920","2709920"," So we're going to show you if you break through, yeah, your price targets above are"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2709920","2714920"," 2380 and 2428, so anything above here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2714920","2718920"," If we get anywhere above this area up here, that's a long, all day long."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2718920","2719920"," Okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2719920","2722920"," That's all I've got for you this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2722920","2729920"," How do you guys have any questions for me right now out there?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2729920","2731920"," New here, New brokerage."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2731920","2732920"," Yeah, I trade on tasty trade."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2732920","2736920"," You guys will see me live trade and this week I believe."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2736920","2741120"," I just have, I've got some more equipment coming in so that I can hide my information from"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2741120","2743920"," you so that you guys can't break into my accounts."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2743920","2747920"," I don't trade on Webull or trading view or book or book map."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2747920","2750920"," I trade on tasty right now and I use options AI as well."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2750920","2753920"," I've got some, you know what I missed on Friday?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2753920","2757920"," I put an order in for hood at the bell and it never failed."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2757920","2762920"," I'm kind of pissed off about that."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2762920","2767920"," Yeah, if you guys want to talk, talk about anything or ask any questions."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2767920","2773920"," If you guys have followed me on that trade on Friday, I hope you guys make bank off the"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2773920","2779920"," bell here and I'm going to put another live stream up with just book map on it and I'll"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2779920","2782920"," talk over that, that video so that we can open the bell together."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2782920","2787920"," I'll put Tesla on this morning so I'll have Tesla and we'll have book map running or"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2787920","2790920"," excuse me, Tesla and spy running to right off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2790920","2793920"," We'll check NQ at some point."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2798920","2800920"," No, so what's my approach with spy?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2800920","2802920"," Okay, we'll go back and we'll rehash it one more time."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2802920","2804920"," We talked about it earlier this morning."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2804920","2808920"," Look at that beautiful, look at that rip on spy on Tesla."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2808920","2810920"," Woo hoo."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2810920","2812920"," Yes."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2812920","2817920"," So we're going to look real quick on the spy and I'm going to give you guys my how I'm"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2817920","2819920"," trading the spy today, okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2819920","2821920"," One more time."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2821920","2827920"," We'll change these to some dotted lines here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2831920","2834920"," All right, can I draw a polyline?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2834920","2836920"," All right, this is a polyline."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2837920","2844920"," Okay, so if we off the bell, if we trade higher, I'm going to be looking for a rejection off"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2844920","2848920"," 478 29."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2848920","2853920"," If we try, if we reject off this is profit taking, okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2853920","2858920"," If you're a bear at this point, you're going to be looking to take some form of a short"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2858920","2864920"," here down, right, and get out of it by this, by this cash gap close."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2864920","2866920"," Does that make sense?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2866920","2869920"," You would pick it back up after 475."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2869920","2872920"," Let's say we take it to here, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2872920","2875920"," And let's say we just start to consolidate here, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2875920","2878920"," You don't want to lose all that money you made, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2878920","2883920"," And you're going to wait for a failure to go higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2883920","2884920"," And then you take this lower."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2884920","2890920"," You might even see some kind of a gas up gas up here and you could enter it a second time"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2890920","2891920"," here if you wanted to."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2891920","2892920"," Does that make sense?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2892920","2894920"," This could happen over here too."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2894920","2896920"," Sometimes you'll see it happen like this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2896920","2900920"," Then we start heading lower, okay?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2900920","2906920"," You could grab this last gas above or you just ride this down, take it a second time"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2906920","2907920"," down over here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2907920","2908920"," Does that make sense?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2908920","2911920"," We're going to put that in the trash."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2911920","2917920"," If you're so off the bell, if we trade higher, I'm looking for a rejection off 478 29."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2917920","2922920"," If we don't see a rejection here, let's say we come up above."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2922920","2925920"," Where's that polyline?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2925920","2927920"," Let's say we come above."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2927920","2929920"," We don't reject, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2929920","2931920"," We're still getting out of my calls here, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2931920","2937920"," I'm going to pick up calls again because if we don't move down, that's a bullish sign, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2937920","2941920"," We're going to make a run higher probably to 480."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2941920","2943920"," We're even higher, 482."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2943920","2944920"," Does that make sense?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2944920","2948920"," There are your two bullish scenarios, I guess."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2948920","2954920"," Up here is where you take a short if you were a bear, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2954920","2960920"," Those are your two scenarios for green bars off the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2960920","2966920"," If you're a bull out there and you missed the buy-in, if you missed the buy-in,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2966920","2969920"," but you're like, oh, we're bullish, we're going much higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2970920","2973920"," Excuse me, you're going to be looking for a couple things."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2973920","2977920"," Wait a minute here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2977920","2981920"," Hold on here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2981920","2983920"," Like I missed that I missed that I missed it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2983920","2988920"," Well, you could buy the bell here, risky, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","2988920","2992920"," Or you're going to be waiting for us to come above and then trade down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2992920","2994920"," You actually buy right here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2994920","2997920"," So you buy the bell or you could buy down below over here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","2997920","3001920"," If we start to trade down though, right off the bell, let's say we start to trade down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3001920","3006920"," You're going to, and you're holding from Friday, you're going to want to sell out of your calls"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3006920","3009920"," and then wait to rebuy down below here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3009920","3011920"," And you don't buy this first bounce."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3011920","3015920"," You're going to be looking for some kind of consolidation, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3015920","3017920"," And the rejection down below."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3017920","3023920"," If we hit bottom three times, let's say, you're going to wait for, usually we'll come up here"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3023920","3026920"," and then you'd buy this one right here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3026920","3028920"," And then that one would actually send us much higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3028920","3029920"," Does that make sense?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3029920","3031920"," So you'd have one, two, three taps."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3031920","3032920"," You have fourth tap."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3032920","3034920"," You'd see it slightly higher."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3034920","3038920"," You'd actually take that one to head north."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3038920","3048920"," Okay, you wait for that one because the alternative is that we show you the alternative here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3048920","3051920"," The alternative here, if you're bearish off the bell, let's say you're like,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3051920","3053920"," hey, I'm fully bearish at this point."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3053920","3055920"," We're just going to doom and gloom it."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3055920","3059920"," We've got an implied move today of 33 points, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3059920","3063920"," So let's say we come down here and you're bearish and you miss the bell."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3063920","3066920"," You're going to look for this hit here, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3066920","3071920"," And you're just going to look for a move that starts down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3071920","3074920"," You don't want to be catching these moves that are moving higher like this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3074920","3076920"," You're going to look for a failure, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3076920","3078920"," You're going to look for this failure here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3078920","3082920"," Once you find that failure, you could grab it on this move down below."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3082920","3084920"," We would trade down at that point."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3084920","3093920"," I believe it's, I think I gave it to you guys earlier."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3093920","3095920"," You've got some price targets down below."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3095920","3102920"," There are 471, 471, 74."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3102920","3107920"," And then if we break below 471, 74 or 470, somewhere in that vicinity,"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3107920","3109920"," 470, 36 or so."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3109920","3113920"," This is the start of bear town volatility and real bear."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3113920","3116920"," And if you want to be market crash bearish, then you're down here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3116920","3118920"," Anything down below here, we break through here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3118920","3120920"," We've got big time doom coming."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3120920","3126920"," But my ultimate target, if we break below 470, would be 465 is where I want to get out."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3126920","3130920"," Okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3130920","3133920"," Pre-market is making another pre-market push."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3133920","3134920"," Yeah."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3134920","3142920"," I like, you know, I don't like, I want to talk to you guys about market hedges right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3142920","3149920"," I like market hedges on individual tickers, but there are easier tickers to hedge than, say, Amazon."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3149920","3157920"," Amazon is kind of like what the hedge funds and the banks use to have exposure in the market when the market goes down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3157920","3158920"," Be aware of that."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3158920","3167920"," Even if Amazon were to sell down to 300 points, it is the market hedge for market crash in a call sense or an equity owning sense."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3167920","3169920"," It is the, it is the hedge of the market."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3169920","3175920"," It's, it's just like what Walmart was in the 80, 1980s, 1990s."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3175920","3178920"," It's, it's, it has to function."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3178920","3180920"," If we don't have Amazon, we don't have a country."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3180920","3185920"," So be, be careful of shorting Amazon outside of its normal trading range."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3185920","3197920"," We can look at Amazon right now."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3197920","3200920"," You got the wrong Amazon chart up here."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3200920","3204920"," We have the Amazon chart."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3204920","3206920"," Let's look at Amazon real quick. Okay."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3206920","3209920"," Because I talked about this on Friday because it is a scary chart."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3209920","3215920"," If we were to break through here, well, let's just look at Amazon over the course of a year."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3215920","3219920"," And, you know, do you really want to try to short this right here?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3219920","3220920"," I don't know."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3220920","3222920"," It would pay a lot of money if he shorted this."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3222920","3223920"," We went down."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3223920","3225920"," But do I want a short Amazon?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3225920","3230920"," I think it's a more difficult short or market short than say the spy."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3230920","3234920"," I think the spy is an easier short than Amazon."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3234920","3239920"," I think that there are more speculative growth stocks that are easier, the easier short."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3239920","3244920"," I think if you look at like socks, you look at semiconductors."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3244920","3246920"," You want to short something?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3246920","3249920"," This looks shortable to me."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3249920","3252920"," Much more so than Amazon does."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3252920","3257920"," Does this look short as an easier market short than Amazon?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3257920","3259920"," It does to me, right?"
"GQm6SFiaiww","3259920","3262920"," So try to work easier if you're going to short indexes."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3262920","3266920"," Try to work easier if you're going to short individual tickers."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3266920","3271920"," I would prefer, I wouldn't short Apple right now per se, but maybe Nvidia."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3271920","3275920"," It'll be a nice one if you were bearish."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3275920","3279920"," You know, I'd probably prefer to short this stock right here than I would Amazon."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3279920","3281920"," Try to find something that's out of top."
"GQm6SFiaiww","3281920","3283920"," You guys can go on Finviz."
