"10","1570"," I don't know if that's public or not."
"2170","3050"," We'll find out."
"6320","12300"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"12300","13880"," before the film begins. "
"15500","45070"," Can you"
"45070","51220"," make sure this is actually live?"
"56940","58020"," So straight over to."
"58460","59700"," Looks like it's live right now."
"63110","63650"," Studio. "
"67080","67800"," Good morning."
"67800","68480"," What's going on, everybody?"
"68800","69420"," How's everybody doing?"
"70700","71560"," Doing a lot, baby."
"71740","73420"," I was trying to get here as soon as I possibly could. "
"73740","76080"," I'm like, these guys are probably freaking out right now."
"79360","80840"," Pink tight one second there."
"82000","83780"," I've got some stuff I got to do in the background. "
"86590","86930"," What is going?"
"91590","93430"," What the fuck is going on?"
"95740","97660"," Oh, this is driving me baddie."
"101330","101730"," Okay."
"106060","106680"," Killing me. "
"108710","109570"," Sorry, I've got it."
"109570","120990"," They got some people working in the background and doing a great job, but it's non"
"120990","121790"," skippable."
"123830","124870"," I can do that one. "
"125610","130150"," I've got some content that's getting flagged in the background."
"130470","132250"," So I got to take a look at why it's getting flagged."
"135940","136920"," We just one second here. "
"143120","151510"," I think a quick bounce right here."
"151770","153810"," We're going to go over the market here in just a moment."
"154010","155170"," I don't think we're done going down. "
"155170","157910"," If you're out, if you're wondering, just right off the bat."
"158090","167710"," If you're like, hey, we got to continue to the downside more than likely the fish stuff that came"
"167710","167890"," out."
"168050","168970"," Yes, they were going to go over that. "
"169310","170910"," I'm sure you've already heard it elsewhere."
"175510","179010"," We'll talk about the fish stuff and what that means."
"180030","187650"," And then I was already known before that we likely get a role why the pitch news came out when"
"187650","187970"," it did. "
"188910","190910"," See if I can do all that right there."
"194240","204140"," Yeah, as soon as that was re uploaded that triggered a school this stuff here live"
"204140","205320"," to live chatting."
"207180","208680"," Let me go to Twitch really quick. "
"212330","213290"," Set that up."
"218350","218910"," Hey, good morning."
"219070","219830"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"221010","225090"," And then I just have to post this on YouTube or on Twitter. "
"228900","232340"," I don't know exactly where it's kind of weird."
"232520","238480"," I'm like, like it's not a tweet any longer, but I'm going to still call it a tweet."
"238520","241000"," I don't think I'm going to call it anything else than what it is. "
"245900","246300"," Yes."
"246300","249740"," Some people are calling it excretions or something and excretes."
"250760","255060"," Like the whole X thing is it's not as catchy as tweet tweets, right?"
"256440","258440"," Let's see, cues, little cues today. "
"260300","261960"," And we'll look at IWM as well."
"262840","269390"," Look at everything today for you so that I'm paying what you're wrapped up in."
"275510","276650"," And it gets set in. "
"277150","280730"," It's part of the reason why I hold on one second again."
"350440","351100"," Sorry about that."
"351140","359340"," I have my wife and kids came back early from vacation and had to do some documentation verification"
"359340","360660"," stuff just then. "
"360660","361900"," So I apologize for that."
"368220","371920"," Okay, so I just posted that."
"372920","373840"," Let's back up and run. "
"374660","375300"," Good afternoon."
"379040","385000"," We've got a website launching here and we have a ton of stuff going on the background for two"
"385000","385220"," launch."
"386900","392260"," It's why I've been with you on live stream this past few days, personal away from my kids just got"
"392260","395780"," back from vacation and it's like demanding wife and kids. "
"398730","399290"," Did you."
"400690","401570"," You got fucked up."
"401730","403050"," I got fucked up in. "
"404370","405290"," What do you call it?"
"406530","406950"," Starbucks."
"407710","409150"," I'm pretty pissed about that one."
"409470","410690"," I took a bath in that. "
"411790","413250"," I'm angry about Starbucks."
"414450","418050"," When we're talking about emotions, hold on one more second here."
"489070","490310"," Sorry about that again. "
"490450","491550"," I've got more interruptions."
"491810","493490"," I probably shouldn't have started the stream."
"495130","501050"," I probably shouldn't have started the stream so quickly, but trying to get on live with you guys. "
"506820","507640"," Hold on one second."
"514220","516500"," Alright, I think I'm back finally."
"516679","518159"," I think that was the last interruption. "
"519159","520820"," So these are things I have to do."
"520900","521900"," I don't have a choice in this."
"522280","522720"," So. "
"526200","529460"," Yes, Starbucks, I take a fucking bath and I'm pretty pissed off about it now."
"530700","532420"," I'm hoping that some of you."
"534080","538340"," We're able to attend the private stream that we put out. "
"539260","543240"," Last weekend on Sunday, we posted an event."
"543840","545400"," I believe in the discord."
"546560","548580"," I don't know if it was Saturday or Sunday night. "
"548680","549600"," We did a live stream."
"550440","552700"," Any of you that were able to show up to that live stream."
"553720","559600"," Should not be shocked by where we are today in any way, shape or form. "
"560840","565620"," As a matter of fact, I was on a call two nights ago with fans and some other people and"
"565620","567960"," they were like, what's the chances of us rolling over this week?"
"568520","574220"," I was like, well, like by 60, 70% by Wednesday or Thursday and then like a 400% by"
"574220","574580"," Friday."
"575820","579660"," So this is not unexpected to see this role."
"581200","582460"," Further now we're going to talk. "
"582660","584400"," I heard someone just said some from Bob Kendall."
"584640","586680"," So we'll discuss that as well."
"587260","588660"," I don't know what Bob has said. "
"589140","589980"," I trust Bob."
"590420","591860"," He's been a mentor of mine."
"591980","593180"," If you didn't know that out there. "
"594200","595620"," He was a mentor of mine."
"597560","602160"," Taught me how to, you know, trade like a professional, I guess."
"602420","604060"," He's one of those mentors for me. "
"604820","606040"," And I trust Bob."
"607360","608700"," We'll talk about whatever Bob."
"608820","611300"," I don't know what Bob was saying, so I can't comment on what he's saying. "
"612420","614300"," But I can comment about a few things."
"615160","618940"," Number one, what we talked about in that live stream on Sunday was important, right?"
"618940","626460"," As we come up to test all time highs, you are going to see multiple things happen."
"626660","627680"," We'll take a look real quick. "
"627940","632840"," We'll kind of give a brief synopsis from that show on Sunday for you."
"634560","636980"," Now the fifth downgrade is the concern."
"637280","638300"," We're going to talk about that too. "
"638480","639400"," That is a major concern."
"639620","640320"," We're going to talk about it."
"641600","646260"," Now we'll look at the, we'll look at a few things for you to look at here. "
"646260","648860"," So a whole bunch of stuff for you to understand here."
"649280","651660"," So we're going to look at the 30 minute chart."
"652660","654800"," Well on spy really quick. "
"656260","656900"," And."
"662100","668810"," So just on the 30 minute chart on spy."
"670050","677350"," It was a 30 minute T four chart and you could actually see the break below the nice squeeze"
"677350","678910"," actually traded this right here. "
"679550","683650"," I did buy calls down here, made a lot of money, took the money and ran up here."
"684310","688970"," Now yesterday there was some concern right in the morning here."
"689690","692370"," We had a pretty negative early cross right here. "
"693050","695190"," And we were not able to get above it."
"696290","703830"," Another key point here on yesterday's close was that Starbucks man bad news and they sold"
"703830","704310"," everything."
"704570","706330"," It didn't matter what it was was getting sold. "
"706330","710210"," So there was kind of like a kind of had a kind of new."
"710830","715390"," That if you didn't break above yesterday at any point in the open and towards the close."
"716190","717690"," That was pretty bearish. "
"717690","721490"," Now the fifth news hadn't come out at that point right I don't think it dropped until 5 p.m."
"722190","724050"," But if you were just looking at a chart."
"724730","729390"," You can kind of clearly see that you had to look at SPX really quick."
"732880","735120"," Kind of see here in a higher time frame. "
"735120","740600"," So one of us SP excuse me."
"744030","747770"," Kind of see here just into the close yesterday you can't really have."
"748990","753530"," This nice beautiful high right and then this break below is fine actually. "
"753990","760410"," But we always talk here about the failure to get back up right can't have that failure and you"
"760410","761410"," can't get underneath."
"762530","766730"," Right when you start to see this action here you guys already know what this means right it's not"
"766730","767110"," good."
"767710","769710"," We ended up bloodbath and down right. "
"770530","772150"," So this is not to be unexpected."
"772710","779630"," You've been given enough time into yesterday's close to go back and at least tag that new high even"
"779630","780810"," if it pulls back again."
"782010","784650"," So you can have some continuation to the upside. "
"784970","789050"," So the warning signs there as of this past few sessions."
"789510","789790"," Fuck yeah."
"790070","795350"," We're warning signs have been there since the 27th 28th and what needed to happen. "
"795350","800970"," And we talk about this in a smaller time frames like a one minute five minute doesn't matter still"
"800970","806270"," applies to higher time frames as well as a matter of fact this morning on spy."
"806910","809190"," If you were walking back this."
"809830","813410"," If you were watching the open this morning on spy specifically. "
"815230","818750"," Right around I think it was three or not four o'clock maybe like six o'clock this morning or"
"818750","819390"," something like that."
"820290","821790"," Go to spy really quick."
"821790","831700"," Yeah I don't think even this is I don't even think that is"
"831700","832660"," showing it right there. "
"833620","835580"," This morning I was right in here."
"837100","842320"," But this morning I woke up at four a.m. and I snapped a little box up here."
"842860","846160"," And I was like yeah if this if this was a if this. "
"846660","852400"," If this here rejects this morning before the open going down to the depths of hell and sure enough"
"852400","857340"," the rejection came in at like eight seven eight in the morning you already knew that we're going"
"857340","857780"," down off."
"857780","860580"," This open so it's pretty easy to see."
"862120","867820"," Fairly easy to see this morning before I would have another computer somewhere and I'm like that's"
"867820","868540"," going to go down today. "
"869900","878720"," So in that mean that we had we talked about pullbacks and why we'll get pullbacks as we go higher"
"878720","880580"," in the volatility that'll come with it."
"880580","883180"," So we're back on SPX really quick here."
"884280","885760"," And you're going to see. "
"887380","888880"," As we approach."
"889900","893340"," All time highs you're going to see bad stuff happen right you're going to see."
"894800","897800"," Selling matter of fact you're going to see myself saying. "
"898520","903740"," I've got money out there like I've got a ton of money investment accounts out in the marketplace."
"904320","907360"," And these are the signposts for you to."
"908760","912160"," To panic right like fuck this I've had made plenty of money here. "
"912320","913680"," I don't want to get caught in that right."
"914880","919640"," We'll talk about liquidity at some point today where is the actual liquidity where are the buyers"
"919640","921120"," where will they step back in."
"921300","925460"," And I want you to think about that as well if I sell my my investment accounts. "
"926320","931880"," Where would I would be willing to buy back in for a run higher or leave twenty five percent on."
"931880","935800"," That kind of stuff we discussed this in this video right we talked about."
"936520","940080"," This video that we did we talked specifically about as we get up here. "
"940340","944060"," You're going to see noise tons of noise."
"944800","949640"," And the two key points about that would be look for a place to buy a dip."
"949960","951420"," Number one right. "
"952380","956640"," And a soberish emotional state right."
"956640","962220"," That you can't be emotionally like a teenager or child and panic right."
"962440","967200"," You're actually looking for dips to buy to get up into this all time highs. "
"967880","972680"," And also to know that you're going to get violent roles as we head down here."
"973340","977900"," That if you're to wake up one morning and we're down a hundred two hundred three hundred."
"978020","980220"," Matter of fact I think I was stuck in a chase in a meeting. "
"981420","982520"," Hold on a second here."
"990340","994520"," And the meeting and I think Binky and Chase are there and I was like I was like yeah you're"
"994520","1000960"," still looking for you're looking for good entries and you're not going to panic if you wake up to a"
"1000960","1001700"," roll one morning."
"1001940","1004980"," And I think we're talking about two or three hundred points and I was like well let's try five or"
"1004980","1012520"," five or six hundred on NASDAQ or even or even on DIA. "
"1013080","1015560"," So you're going to see this as we approach."
"1015580","1020740"," We talked about encountering vol as we get up here as a standard."
"1021740","1028480"," Okay now as we encounter this vol as we head high this is going to discuss Bob Kendall whatever Bob"
"1028480","1029180"," Kendall said. "
"1029900","1033180"," Now this is going to discuss that point right here."
"1033339","1038839"," Number one you are going to get at least one correction as we come up here."
"1039560","1043000"," At least one nice fat correction guaranteed. "
"1045579","1053120"," Number two even when we get those corrections this hopefully is to Bob's point whatever Bob's I"
"1053120","1054240"," don't know what Bob's been saying."
"1054700","1061660"," Now I will say something about Bob's point here is that when you get those corrections we can see"
"1061660","1065820"," we can see how severe those corrections are."
"1065820","1071860"," Are they corrective or is it a top and I think that's some of the questions in the in the"
"1071860","1073580"," chat right now is a cap. "
"1074380","1077200"," Is this a top or is this a."
"1078420","1082260"," Or is this going to be just the correction I want you to I want you guys to pay attention"
"1082260","1082900"," to something here."
"1083360","1085600"," This is the pay attention part of the broadcast."
"1087260","1090740"," So we are coming into some sort of a bottom. "
"1095280","1096700"," Here I got to switch this."
"1099130","1099370"," Okay."
"1100550","1103870"," We are coming into some kind of a bottoming area here. "
"1104730","1106410"," You see the daily trigger coming up."
"1107950","1113830"," We're going to we're going to assume that we're going down further and break through this daily"
"1113830","1114410"," trigger here."
"1115210","1117350"," That's four forty six and change. "
"1118490","1120790"," At this point we're going to assume that we're coming down."
"1122590","1125290"," Now if you're like well hey cap is over."
"1125870","1128990"," Maybe we don't slam through the daily trigger cap. "
"1129070","1134810"," I'm also going to show you what that would look like if we don't and how you can get long"
"1134810","1135550"," again."
"1136350","1145800"," And what you're looking for here is for some kind of a reversal to the upside."
"1146220","1148040"," You want to see price get back above. "
"1154660","1158200"," You want to see price get back above the five minute."
"1158760","1159160"," Right."
"1160240","1164420"," And bounce at least once or twice in that five minute begin to make its way higher. "
"1165020","1168240"," You want to see the hourly start to flatten out and you have a trade here."
"1168520","1169660"," There's a trade there."
"1170300","1172380"," I'm not really a fan of that trade personally. "
"1172840","1178520"," I'd really like to see us get above the hourly and then work on some continuation to the upside for"
"1178520","1178720"," bulls."
"1179000","1180060"," So bulls have work to do."
"1180480","1181660"," It's like we say about bears right?"
"1181820","1182320"," You got work to do. "
"1182380","1182960"," You got to be tactful."
"1183480","1186620"," And as a bull you have to be tactful as well right here."
"1186620","1192440"," Now and believe it or not you can't even get bullish again as a bull until we break and hold"
"1192440","1194460"," and confirm above the hourly trigger. "
"1195080","1199100"," Once you win that hourly trigger it's a situation normal back on track again."
"1201640","1203180"," Now right now you're trading underneath."
"1204540","1206200"," This is the wrong line by the way. "
"1206320","1207140"," This is a different line."
"1208080","1209820"," You actually need to get above the one minute trigger."
"1210180","1211520"," The women it's not showing here. "
"1211840","1213940"," So I'm speaking too soon."
"1214740","1216160"," But anyways you get the point right."
"1217180","1221700"," Now this now it's a questionable Bob Kendall money might be saying out there. "
"1221800","1224340"," What's important about this is we go to a different chart here."
"1224700","1225700"," See if I can."
"1227500","1229400"," See we can show this in a better light. "
"1229620","1233780"," But here hold on here."
"1242570","1243990"," We're going to speak to the."
"1247190","1248870"," To what Bob Kendall is saying. "
"1248870","1251450"," And I want you guys to see something here on a bull run."
"1252490","1254030"," You will see price."
"1254030","1255650"," Paul McCursor over here right. "
"1256270","1257790"," Price will break down below."
"1257790","1259050"," Break down below."
"1259210","1260950"," Let's say you get the bloodbath correction. "
"1261570","1261850"," It's like."
"1262410","1263610"," Let's say we've got a."
"1264290","1265950"," We've got touch the daily trigger."
"1266350","1267730"," That's like a pullback right. "
"1268190","1271650"," We've got a correction which is to the weekly trigger."
"1272430","1273870"," And then we've got the market is topping."
"1274870","1275390"," So. "
"1277600","1280820"," Right now we're not even at touch the fucking yellow line are we."
"1281200","1282300"," We're like up here."
"1283440","1284800"," And you've got panic. "
"1285540","1287360"," Right there we have right right there."
"1287360","1287820"," We're here."
"1287940","1288800"," We have panic in the marketplace. "
"1289940","1290340"," You understand."
"1291700","1295900"," We also can have Bob Kendall's possibly saying allegedly."
"1296280","1296920"," I don't know what he said. "
"1297040","1297280"," So."
"1297880","1299080"," Let's say you get a pullback."
"1299940","1300980"," Corrective type movement. "
"1300980","1302360"," Right down to the weekly trigger."
"1303120","1305800"," I want you to notice something about these movements here."
"1306000","1307360"," So we get a bloodbath down here. "
"1307460","1308180"," Almost hit it."
"1308440","1310000"," Let's say we get the bloodbath right there."
"1310980","1312560"," There are some key points here. "
"1312560","1316720"," And that is that the yellow line is not rolling into that orange line."
"1316720","1317040"," Is it?"
"1317340","1322320"," Notice how the notice how the yellow line is continuing sideways and higher."
"1323380","1328560"," You will notice though that as the yellow line begins to try to cross that becomes more attractive"
"1328560","1329460"," that orange line. "
"1329860","1331180"," We get a little bit more."
"1331940","1332500"," There it's right."
"1333180","1335680"," I want you to see that yellow line as it crosses here. "
"1337160","1337720"," Right."
"1337860","1342820"," You actually find out that the run is over over here."
"1342820","1347820"," But notice how the yellow line is just marching forward, marching forward, marching forward. "
"1347940","1351080"," At no point does it cross and say fuck you, the run is over."
"1353300","1358000"," Another point here is even if you do even if the yellow line does cross."
"1359200","1363420"," You typically have at least one more chance to get out of the market. "
"1364120","1365840"," Okay, so you get the yellow line cross here."
"1366300","1368000"," Here's your real warning sign there."
"1368200","1368980"," There's your second one. "
"1369080","1372800"," We blast back down and sure enough we come right back up to."
"1372800","1375620"," To where that correction began up here."
"1376200","1377840"," So I want you to see that as well. "
"1378740","1379940"," And it's important."
"1380060","1380580"," Okay."
"1381320","1383860"," I want you to see its importance that you break below. "
"1383960","1384800"," You come back up."
"1385520","1390780"," You have the cross here when you're still given a chance to exit the market in an early fashion."
"1391300","1394460"," So what are we looking for where we are right now?"
"1396140","1399720"," Well, how does that impact us where we are right now inside the market?"
"1400300","1407520"," That would say to us that if we watch a bloodbath, let's say a straight bloodbath in the"
"1407520","1409760"," marketplace chase is stoked. "
"1410580","1413560"," But the yellow line is continuing higher here."
"1415940","1418240"," That's going to say to you what it's going to say."
"1418460","1423100"," Oh, yeah, you're expecting a ricochet effect and new highs again. "
"1423600","1426280"," So you're looking for a place to buy the dip here."
"1426520","1427340"," Does that make sense to you?"
"1428340","1431060"," But if you were to see that yellow line begin to curl over."
"1432300","1433160"," And down. "
"1434000","1436900"," Right, you're going to say, yeah, maybe this correction isn't correction."
"1437560","1440160"," Maybe this is going to be more of a bloodbath to the downside."
"1440380","1442980"," So we'll be able to see in advance. "
"1444300","1447100"," If there's any kind of hey, this isn't just a correction."
"1447580","1451260"," This isn't just a test of the daily trigger."
"1452080","1454620"," Any of that stuff or this is the market top. "
"1455180","1456920"," You won't be able to get out of it."
"1457080","1457840"," You know, that kind of stuff."
"1459300","1462560"," So for right now, you're looking for just one thing. "
"1462780","1466920"," You're in stage one, which would be a pullback to the daily trigger."
"1467580","1473040"," Well, hopefully a tag of the daily trigger or even a breakthrough the daily trigger down here would"
"1473040","1474100"," be really nice to see."
"1474760","1479700"," Cool that market off and give it a chance to at least come back up and trade. "
"1479700","1483700"," Trade this zone, consolidate for the move higher."
"1484520","1492220"," If we begin at any point to break through that 447 in change, 447 50 something like that."
"1492660","1494040"," 447 flat would be nice. "
"1494900","1496500"," And then start to reject off of that."
"1497040","1499680"," We'll trade that next leg down lower."
"1499940","1501740"," So I'll give you that example right there. "
"1502280","1505860"," So let's say we begin to blast through here."
"1508420","1508700"," Right."
"1508940","1512460"," And we get the we watch the next phase of a correction take place. "
"1512480","1515460"," You would see a failure again in here, right?"
"1515920","1516620"," Drown the bull."
"1517340","1519260"," And then we'll start blasting down."
"1519300","1527340"," You would add or enter a short position or long put position down to the weekly trigger here at 435"
"1527340","1528020"," ish. "
"1528600","1533940"," I'm going to expect to be somewhere in there for 435 something like that to then test this one"
"1533940","1535180"," right here."
"1535780","1537540"," Now do I think this is the top?"
"1537840","1539500"," Nothing says we're at a top here."
"1539760","1540100"," Zero. "
"1540920","1548340"," Maybe the fish warning says we're at a top will discuss fish here in the next few upcoming moments."
"1549020","1553720"," But if you are a bull, you are looking for, if you're a bull out there watching this program, you"
"1553720","1555900"," are looking for, hold on here."
"1557400","1564140"," You're looking for volatility as we hit all time highs and you're looking for blocks of liquidity"
"1564140","1564960"," that are available. "
"1567980","1569020"," For 30."
"1570440","1571300"," Right in there."
"1572400","1576840"," Blocks of liquidity to jump in and take this market higher to all time highs. "
"1577300","1579700"," Your thesis has not changed as a bull."
"1580160","1581220"," None of your thesis has changed."
"1581660","1586900"," Regardless of what Fitch is saying, you're actually looking for a place to buy a fat fucking dip"
"1586900","1588040"," and take it to all time eyes. "
"1588800","1590120"," Nothing has changed here."
"1590120","1597600"," So any of the stuff that you're following on social media, on Twitter, on Reddit, on Wall Street"
"1597600","1601380"," Bets, even the Fitch downgrading."
"1602280","1607600"," Some of you are going to say, well, I read an article yesterday for, I read two articles. "
"1608560","1614720"," I read one from Washington Post and I read one from Al Jazeera."
"1615660","1623320"," And it was funny because the Washington Post article didn't want to discuss the insurrection as"
"1623320","1625200"," part of the reasoning for the downgrade."
"1626280","1633560"," Whereas other news, not just Al Jazeera, but other news organizations brought that up. "
"1634400","1640680"," But the other fascinating part was some of the news articles were quoted as saying that when we got"
"1640680","1648740"," a downgrade in 2011, that we started crashing on August 8th or something."
"1649080","1654100"," But we had already started going down before the downgrade took place."
"1654360","1657500"," The market had already began to roll down and took a quick bounce. "
"1657660","1658700"," I think it went down 14."
"1659040","1662360"," The last little bit did go down, I think 14%."
"1662360","1668640"," But we were already down like 17 fucking percent or something once we rolled into that downgrade. "
"1671360","1676500"," I'm assuming that most of you, I'm assuming if you're a barrier like Fitch downgrade, we're going"
"1676500","1678400"," down, we're going to give up 20% right away."
"1678580","1678880"," It's done."
"1679140","1680440"," It's done because of that. "
"1680900","1683420"," You're going to see panic in the marketplace, all that kind of stuff."
"1685140","1686820"," We go down and see what you guys are seeing in the chat."
"1690880","1692100"," No, it's definitely the Fitch. "
"1692420","1695040"," Well, without a doubt, if it's going to be anything, for me, it's going to be Fitch."
"1695800","1700520"," The bond stuff is the after effect."
"1701180","1708720"," And that's where the fair comes in that with the downgrade that money will leave with the stock"
"1708720","1713000"," market and enter like TLT, high quality bonds. "
"1713700","1715000"," You'll see a jump in."
"1715700","1718740"," We had to look at TLT too because I thought that was fascinating too."
"1719320","1720640"," Let's talk about TLT really quick. "
"1723420","1731030"," Let's chat about TLT because I was looking at TLT too and I'm like, man, I was like, I'm like,"
"1731050","1732550"," I'm looking at TLT here."
"1734850","1739200"," And I was looking at it yesterday in the close."
"1740460","1747740"," And I was like, boy, I was like, that issuance came out right when TLT was looking. "
"1748720","1748900"," Let me see."
"1749060","1749580"," Let me see."
"1749660","1750740"," Let me show you a better chart here. "
"1753060","1756340"," I was looking at bonds yesterday as that news broke."
"1756580","1758240"," And I was like, let's take a look at TLT."
"1758380","1758860"," Wait a minute here. "
"1759240","1759680"," There it is."
"1759820","1760380"," I already had it up."
"1760960","1762000"," I was already looking at it. "
"1765210","1777070"," You know, whenever this news breaks, am I"
"1777070","1777750"," doing wrong here?"
"1778390","1779150"," Give me one second."
"1784270","1786030"," I shouldn't be doing any comparing here."
"1787150","1788810"," I fucked something up here just now. "
"1800680","1803200"," I was looking at this chart yesterday on TLT."
"1803940","1811040"," And I was like, man, I was like, this news dropped out just when TLT was looking at its most"
"1811040","1812300"," extreme bearish."
"1813140","1818380"," Almost as if this credit rating knew that bonds were going to collapse. "
"1819160","1825900"," And so the question becomes, will that bond money enter TLT down here in these lows?"
"1826520","1828640"," Or are they going to enter even lower?"
"1829420","1834380"," Down at this $90 mark, there's $89.90. You can't have TLT crash."
"1834720","1841580"," And when you have specific entities that don't want to see continuation of the downside on TLT."
"1848570","1857070"," My thought here is that there are people that don't want to see money flow back into the bond"
"1857070","1857410"," market. "
"1857410","1864030"," To exit, it's almost like a push to exit the equities markets and put your money somewhere else."
"1864390","1868670"," It's almost like as you come to this top to say, yeah, take your money out of the stock market,"
"1868670","1869950"," go long TLT."
"1870630","1873930"," And don't have an implosion of bonds, believe it or not. "
"1879750","1881010"," Fucking V-shaped recovery."
"1881530","1882570"," Yeah, you're getting one."
"1884330","1888590"," I am not in the camp of, I want you to understand that I am not in the camp of"
"1888590","1889270"," death and destruction. "
"1890590","1896010"," I am in the camp of, I am in the camp, but you should have paid it."
"1896190","1897890"," Hopefully you got to see that video."
"1898570","1899250"," What am I doing?"
"1899450","1899950"," Here's the wrong one. "
"1900370","1901230"," Just one second here."
"1903810","1905050"," Hold on one second here."
"1911600","1912940"," Dude, what is going on here?"
"1913100","1913860"," Hold on one second here. "
"1915040","1916260"," Having some issues here."
"1944240","1946420"," I'm not in camp death and destruction."
"1946760","1950240"," It has to be pretty honest with you guys out there. "
"1950240","1953280"," So right now you're getting a reversal."
"1955180","1957880"," That other white line that I had was not a one minute line."
"1957920","1960480"," It was something else that I added into the program here. "
"1961120","1962340"," But you are seeing a reversal."
"1963340","1964600"," You're going to be looking for what?"
"1964940","1966920"," This is a one minute chart here."
"1967700","1971620"," You are going to be looking for, you guys know what to look for here, right?"
"1971740","1972560"," You guys don't need me. "
"1972600","1973820"," I've taught you this at this point."
"1974820","1975620"," Regurgitation, right?"
"1975820","1976760"," The red line to come underneath."
"1977900","1981460"," You're going to be looking for the bounce to the upside, right?"
"1981820","1986140"," You can already see five minutes is becoming bullish. "
"1986520","1988000"," The hourly is becoming bullish."
"1988860","1989900"," This looks like a bottom."
"1990100","1990740"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1990860","1991620"," It looks like a bottom here."
"1993040","1995180"," And we'll try to trade this up."
"1996040","2002040"," An upside target right now is four thirty five fifty. "
"2002620","2004500"," Four thirty five fifty four spy."
"2007100","2009480"," We'll take a look at a little one second here."
"2012590","2014490"," It looks like a local bottom for just a moment here. "
"2017560","2018540"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"2018540","2019980"," You guys know what to look for, don't you?"
"2023600","2024340"," What do we say?"
"2024500","2030530"," Four thirty five fifty right up in here?"
"2031850","2033550"," It's a price target for you to the upside."
"2037060","2038020"," Make that one green. "
"2038700","2040960"," You guys already have these lines right here."
"2041500","2042740"," Oh, you guys don't have those."
"2042900","2043120"," I do. "
"2043520","2045740"," I don't send you these pivots out to you guys."
"2046560","2049340"," So we'll see if we can get a nice fat bump up here."
"2049340","2050179"," Rejection there. "
"2050380","2051639"," Cross on this one right here."
"2052159","2054199"," And you already know what to look for to the upside here."
"2055380","2061420"," Upside target for fifty three fifty for the bulls. "
"2063239","2065719"," This is kind of a key area though right here, okay?"
"2066060","2067280"," So I'm going to show you guys something here."
"2068500","2078400"," Bears, if you want continuation of the downside, if you want"
"2078400","2086040"," continuation to the downside in your bear, you must get a rejection up here at S3 and the hourly"
"2086040","2086380"," trigger."
"2088460","2098430"," If there is a trade higher, if this proves itself to the upside, I'll take a long call with"
"2098430","2100330"," you in just a moment. "
"2105010","2106090"," So right in here."
"2106410","2110650"," And we're going to look and show that spy."
"2113100","2114840"," Thirty minute T 30 chart. "
"2118700","2119880"," I mean, this is the place, right?"
"2120940","2123820"," This is the juicy place where you buy a fucking dip again, right?"
"2124080","2125640"," You can just brush off the pitch news."
"2126240","2127700"," So just on the pitch news."
"2128180","2130400"," Let's stay back on target and topic here. "
"2130400","2133920"," So let's start with normal pullback to the daily trigger."
"2134220","2136380"," That's the, that's what we're in phase one right now."
"2136840","2138340"," We're not in panic, the marketplace. "
"2138960","2140200"," We're not in doom and gloom."
"2141260","2145740"," If you wanted to go to a corrective stance in the market, we're going to have a correction."
"2148400","2151080"," So there's your hourly trigger right here. "
"2154710","2156590"," Here's your daily trigger right here."
"2157250","2159010"," I'm going to give you every scenario, okay?"
"2160190","2160810"," Right now."
"2160970","2167710"," So if we began to sell down, boom, boom, boom, boom, the daily trigger here tagged 447 and then"
"2167710","2169150"," immediately come back up. "
"2169770","2170990"," That's just a pullback, right?"
"2171930","2173450"," We know that's just a pullback."
"2174590","2179530"," If you come down here, boom, boom, boom, slam down below and we start to pin under the daily"
"2179530","2179850"," trigger."
"2180510","2181930"," That's 447 50. "
"2183470","2184650"," Start heading down."
"2185170","2187070"," That means they're getting a correction, right?"
"2187730","2189230"," Take the corrective stance, right?"
"2192420","2198460"," You know that if we have a recovery here and you're a seller, a bull, you need to get that"
"2198460","2202640"," rejection to finally tag that daily trigger."
"2203060","2204040"," And then you're going to look for two. "
"2204200","2205960"," You're going to take your shorts off, right?"
"2206960","2211380"," And you're going to wait for the rejection underneath to reenter short."
"2212660","2212840"," Right?"
"2213320","2217260"," Because if we have that V-shaped recovery off the daily, you're going to lose all your money again,"
"2217260","2217680"," right?"
"2218020","2221560"," If we bounce and start recovering off this, it's going to be a moonshot."
"2221720","2222920"," It's going to go straight up. "
"2225500","2228400"," So you have to be tactful here if you're a bear, right?"
"2228560","2230240"," You have each leg of a correction."
"2231000","2234120"," You're looking for daily trigger to the downside as your first leg."
"2235220","2236820"," Your second leg is weekly trigger. "
"2236980","2238060"," I still have puts on, by the way."
"2238580","2239520"," I was going to sell them today."
"2239700","2241160"," I've said tell people I had till Wednesday. "
"2242340","2244240"," I'm going to leave them on, just in case."
"2248040","2250580"," But you know where you are right now, right?"
"2250680","2251820"," You know what you're looking for here?"
"2253100","2255060"," Looking good for bulls right now."
"2255840","2257120"," You know, let me bring up. "
"2257180","2258580"," Let me do take some trades with you guys."
"2258760","2259100"," Hold on here."
"2272860","2274220"," Let me see a treasure. "
"2274540","2276780"," 25% more percent not bullish, huh?"
"2277000","2277200"," Okay."
"2278840","2279500"," Let me see."
"2283330","2283730"," Yeah. "
"2288950","2289310"," So you ready?"
"2291090","2294910"," The 435 is the weekly trigger case."
"2296150","2296550"," Okay."
"2296670","2296830"," All right. "
"2296850","2299030"," So if you're a bear, I'm going to give you guys some."
"2299030","2300110"," All right."
"2300250","2302590"," So if you're a bear out there, chase, I love you, man. "
"2303550","2303910"," So right."
"2304030","2305110"," I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you some numbers."
"2305330","2306130"," Write this shit down. "
"2308190","2308590"," Okay."
"2308710","2308850"," You ready?"
"2311390","2312670"," Write this shit down, Chase."
"2313430","2314490"," You've got an hourly trigger. "
"2314710","2316230"," It's up here at 454 change."
"2318090","2319890"," The next hour, it'll probably be down here."
"2320110","2320210"," Okay. "
"2320630","2322670"," Next hour or two, right down here, around 453."
"2324090","2327590"," The next number that you need, Chase, is 447."
"2329390","2331530"," And let's call it 44750. "
"2332650","2336210"," The next number that you need is 435."
"2337390","2337830"," Okay."
"2338130","2342150"," So we start to break down below 447 and rejecting. "
"2343330","2345070"," You'll then get your 435."
"2345470","2345930"," Does that make sense?"
"2352810","2354750"," Oh, no, it's all fucked up."
"2359400","2361280"," There's a fumble like the bed all year long. "
"2363500","2364700"," Another zero date field."
"2365320","2367840"," Like whatever caps not streaming, we get to go down."
"2368000","2369380"," And then the moment cap gets back on. "
"2369380","2370300"," That shit gets bought."
"2370600","2371140"," Fucking A."
"2378530","2379490"," Market manipulation."
"2383410","2385350"," You already see it right here, right?"
"2385590","2386410"," Here it goes, baby. "
"2390110","2393330"," They're like, they're like captain us to staff the internet for like a week."
"2394890","2397910"," So we can send this fucking thing down to the depths of hell, please."
"2409230","2412910"," They're like, oh, these little fucking turds are going to go out there and buy zero date calls now"
"2412910","2414830"," with Kevin Jim James and rip this thing higher. "
"2418670","2419870"," I know they're listening."
"2420750","2425990"," I was, I was in a meeting yesterday with a professional group."
"2427870","2432030"," And some of the things those guys are developing. "
"2432030","2434190"," I'm like some of the tools those guys ever insane."
"2435490","2437550"," I got some cool shit for you guys to see."
"2437650","2439130"," I'll drop a link in the discord. "
"2439630","2441310"," You guys want to see what these guys do."
"2441950","2442750"," It's fascinating."
"2444090","2445850"," These are these are by side. "
"2447290","2453630"," This is a by side fund and how they look for liquidity in the market and order blocks and how"
"2453630","2455970"," they try to mask buying the market."
"2455970","2464410"," And it's fascinating to see how they actually carry these things out so that nobody sees them"
"2464410","2465530"," actually entering the market."
"2466270","2468050"," And it's fucking fascinating. "
"2468430","2473910"," I'll send you guys a link by the end of the by the close today."
"2474030","2477390"," I have so on Wednesdays, I got a racing school for sailing."
"2477930","2481590"," So I've got to do that tonight, but I will drop a link to some of this stuff. "
"2482310","2484770"," You guys want to see what a by side fund does."
"2485490","2489970"," Behind the scenes, these guys unmask it all and explain how it's done."
"2490770","2493450"," And I'll give you I'll drop a link in there for you guys. "
"2493970","2498110"," So we're going to get this test right now."
"2498430","2499490"," I'm still not long here."
"2499530","2501990"," I'm looking for looking for that cross right here. "
"2502750","2508100"," I want to see that cross change over red right here."
"2510400","2512100"," I want to see that cross."
"2512380","2514560"," I want to see some successful this here. "
"2516100","2518440"," And then I'm going to step a trade here in just a moment."
"2518680","2519380"," So I'm looking at."
"2522280","2524080"," Four fifty twos are dirt cheap. "
"2524400","2528240"," Man, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, four fifty threes are dirt cheap too."
"2528680","2531480"," Now they're ten cents and four fifty fours are only five cents."
"2532600","2535520"," So the dealers are saying this won't be successful here. "
"2536660","2542400"," And I'm telling you what, if it is successful, you're going to see a giant move."
"2542600","2543540"," Are you going to see these calls?"
"2544760","2546140"," Like a motherfucker up there."
"2546320","2550140"," So we'll look at the four fifty two C's. "
"2559730","2562510"," Surely expecting the results of the federalist repulpiration."
"2574050","2574690"," All right."
"2577120","2578180"," We'll see what's up here. "
"2578280","2579680"," We'll see if this goes to the upside."
"2580840","2584860"," Looking for a successful defense of this cross right now."
"2603520","2606160"," How do I choose strikes in my brain?"
"2606540","2609540"," I don't really think about it like I used to be at least to know everything. "
"2609540","2615620"," For something like this, I'm looking for, I'm trying to find out if the dealers believe we can go"
"2615620","2615820"," there."
"2615840","2616680"," Very simple."
"2616960","2620920"," One spot seven, seven, a trillion dollars at the federalist repulpiration. "
"2621740","2625520"," Or the dealer, the dealer is saying, yeah, there's a high chance we're going up there or not."
"2625640","2627460"," Right now they're saying that they're not through."
"2627600","2630880"," They're either mispricing options right now, which they do. "
"2631240","2632800"," They misprice options all the time."
"2634860","2638860"," And then I try to be, if, if the proves that we're going to go higher."
"2639700","2642240"," I'll try to go a 30 delta. "
"2642700","2644600"," If possible, sometimes a 40 delta."
"2644600","2645880"," If I think the dealers are."
"2646180","2652070"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"2652700","2657000"," If I think that the dealers are off sides, they're the kind of way. "
"2659960","2664480"," I'll take a little bit more risk in terms of buying even cheaper, like 10 sensors or something."
"2664480","2670780"," Another fair with what this looks like is it looks like the dealers are saying, yeah, you'll be"
"2670780","2672520"," offered this, but it's going to trade sideways."
"2673980","2676880"," It's not going to actually go up there and test that early trigger. "
"2677040","2678800"," So what am I looking for there?"
"2678920","2681520"," I'm looking for this here and this here for any kind of."
"2683120","2685280"," Any kind of rejections as we go higher."
"2685280","2686480"," So that would be like this. "
"2687340","2688940"," Where we come up here, right?"
"2689380","2692420"," And just reject and not be able to get up to this next pivot here."
"2692420","2696280"," So take my money and run on each one of these trades, right?"
"2696540","2697520"," As we are going to head up there."
"2699040","2703460"," So I would look for zero dates to trade from here to here because they're directional trades,"
"2703460","2703860"," right?"
"2704200","2707540"," I don't want them to put us up there and not print those calls. "
"2708860","2716680"," So I would exit here, re-enter here, enter here, exit here, enter here, or enter here, excuse me."
"2716680","2720680"," Enter here, exit here, enter again here and exit up here."
"2721420","2726840"," You could, with a thesis, you could buy one dates or five dates. "
"2728080","2729280"," It's kind of pissy on Monday."
"2729700","2735700"," I bought, so I rode that, I rode that right up on Monday, but I fucking bought weekly calls."
"2737400","2742040"," And so I made money, but not a ton on that close on Monday. "
"2742160","2745240"," I made a ton, I made good money, but I didn't make the five or six thousand percent."
"2746120","2747380"," I didn't trade zero dates on Monday."
"2748500","2750120"," And once we got up there, I was like, fuck that. "
"2750120","2750480"," I'm out."
"2750640","2752740"," I'm like, that's a big ass run up into that close."
"2754240","2755460"," So I took the money and ran. "
"2755920","2760700"," So, you know, I was kind of pissed at myself for not taking zero dates, or two days ago, on"
"2760700","2761520"," the market."
"2761740","2764080"," So we're going to watch this right here unfold and see what happens."
"2764580","2766100"," Still in no calls right now, I haven't set up. "
"2766680","2770800"," I want to see the confirmation that we're going higher."
"2771160","2771760"," Still don't see it."
"2772420","2773700"," You can also wait yourself. "
"2774320","2778420"," You would actually look for a spy to squeeze up right here."
"2779080","2780160"," Fail back down."
"2781880","2783920"," And you'll see that confirmation move. "
"2784660","2786500"," And then you can enter the trade right about there."
"2787960","2789140"," Right about there."
"2802480","2804580"," Yeah, even a coin for you, I will. "
"2822960","2826060"," Coins sitting on their daily trigger right now at this moment."
"2826860","2829540"," So they're parked right on their daily trigger."
"2830020","2831240"," That's 8854. "
"2831880","2836100"," Their weekly trigger is 7225."
"2836620","2841500"," So any kind of bad news, you're going to expect a tag of that 7225."
"2842220","2843620"," Let me just one second here. "
"2868520","2871580"," Their ER is, tell me if I have this wrong or right."
"2871860","2874060"," Sometimes the data that I get is inaccurate."
"2874420","2877100"," I've got their earnings as Thursday after the close. "
"2877940","2879600"," Does that sound right to you or wrong?"
"2882070","2885550"," They have an 8.7% move implied."
"2886530","2891830"," I'm going to expect that move to be right off of where it's sitting right now and it's a daily"
"2891830","2892110"," trigger."
"2892730","2895030"," So 8.7% on coin. "
"2901000","2909370"," It looks like the same setup as this kind of odd."
"2909890","2918230"," So it's got a 9% implied move coming into its earnings, but I've got the downside move at about"
"2918230","2921050"," 19%."
"2922190","2929730"," So I would be very, I would say that you're likely going to get a larger move than the implied"
"2929730","2930210"," move. "
"2931250","2939330"," So you could do spreads or not spreads, but I would do OTM strangle on that trade."
"2940270","2945770"," I think to the upside, you'll only get your 9% move up, but I think your downside has more"
"2945770","2946530"," potential."
"2949770","2952050"," Now you might get the 20 on the upside, too. "
"2952970","2960150"," If you date them far enough out, I might get a strangle that's like two or three expires away with"
"2960150","2961290"," like a 20% move."
"2962950","2965370"," Believe it or not, on coin base."
"2967770","2975580"," I think that the I think the dealers are wrong in that call that 8.7% move that's priced"
"2975580","2976000"," in. "
"2976000","2980140"," I think you're going to get closer to 20 overall."
"2980500","2985220"," It might take two or three strikes to get there, but I think you get both on coin."
"2988570","2992650"," The downside target for me on coin is $72. "
"2993390","2998630"," Upside target for me on coin is $106.82 somewhere in there."
"2999670","3001850"," And that's not what the options market is saying right now."
"3006040","3009120"," Yeah, so I've got it tomorrow after the close. "
"3009720","3011120"," I just want to confirm that's true."
"3011680","3017320"," Sometimes these fucking earnings that they sometimes these earnings are the dates and times are not"
"3017320","3017740"," accurate."
"3018600","3019800"," Still no trade for me. "
"3020520","3024440"," Still watching the role right here, still in no calls so you can see it."
"3025160","3026540"," I want to see the cross."
"3027320","3030220"," I don't ever want to see any kind of like chop zone sideways. "
"3030320","3031660"," I want to see the break above."
"3032400","3036620"," I want to see the cross of the white line without seeing that no trade still."
"3036620","3046730"," Deep in the heart of heads, the depths, you"
"3046730","3046870"," know. "
"3047830","3049930"," Yeah, I'm not so TLT."
"3050950","3059190"," I'm looking for my guess here is that my guess here is that is that someone's looking for a nice"
"3059190","3060930"," fat bottom to buy on TLT."
"3061410","3065750"," And they're going to try to push money out of the equity market into TLT. "
"3066790","3069670"," So I'm fascinated by I'm watching TLT right now myself."
"3069930","3072850"," I'd like to buy a dip down there too and put some money into that."
"3074370","3077670"," So whatever fear, mongering, you're hearing about TLT. "
"3078670","3080190"," I would say go against that."
"3080350","3083050"," I'd say I'd say don't believe any of that shit."
"3083730","3085810"," Look for a nice trade in TLT. "
"3086830","3087950"," That's a fucking lule."
"3088870","3091190"," Is anybody against the trade in TLT?"
"3092830","3093930"," Anybody saying no?"
"3094330","3095350"," I'd love to hear if you're."
"3096490","3101310"," I always love to hear people that are like don't don't don't don't don't don't get into TLT and"
"3101310","3102430"," sell the stock market. "
"3104330","3106490"," They find that very ironic."
"3108330","3110490"," Sell the stock market and don't buy TLT."
"3110690","3111150"," I'm like okay. "
"3111470","3114570"," All right."
"3116330","3118850"," Yeah, I've got a mess happening tomorrow after the bell."
"3123540","3124400"," So it's I can. "
"3127710","3128870"," So there you go, Basra."
"3129010","3130670"," I gave you a I gave you a."
"3132270","3133650"," There's my take on coin."
"3134610","3136630"," Do you want my my think about coin earnings?"
"3139170","3141710"," It's all coin on earnings have always pissed me off. "
"3141710","3142910"," You can tell it's a."
"3143130","3145230"," It will ramp up its debt issuance."
"3145230","3148090"," Just today off for the US was downgraded by the trading."
"3150330","3151230"," Not just coin. "
"3151570","3159740"," I think all all exchange crypto exchange trading I feel like is."
"3160600","3162980"," It's not based in any kind of fundamental reality."
"3174390","3175390"," What am I doing here?"
"3180540","3182200"," You bought a bunch of a TMF today?"
"3182200","3184000"," Yeah, I like the TMF trade. "
"3184000","3184760"," I like that."
"3185480","3187220"," I actually like that better than."
"3188020","3190180"," Herms just said he bought a bunch of TMF today. "
"3191120","3194260"," And I actually don't actually like TMF."
"3194300","3200480"," I like the three time bear in bull trades better than the actual like TLT trade."
"3201140","3202260"," I fucking hate TLT. "
"3202320","3205240"," It's like you got to stay in it for like four weeks while the rest of the market's off doing"
"3205240","3205800"," its own thing."
"3206800","3208920"," So herms is a great point inside the chat there, man."
"3208920","3216400"," I'm actually more of a fan of the three times bull and bear ETFs for expressing that bullishness. "
"3227630","3228930"," It's twice the normal volume."
"3229270","3229870"," Good heads up on that."
"3230030","3230610"," That's a she. "
"3231550","3235430"," She PGA just said TMF is almost twice the normal volume today."
"3236950","3238450"," Yeah, we'll look at a cues too."
"3238550","3240890"," Let's go around the market so you guys have some targets. "
"3241550","3244750"," I'm going to give you guys targets for all three indexes."
"3245250","3246210"," Matter of fact, I'm going to run through."
"3246770","3248530"," If you're an SPX trader, I'll do. "
"3248650","3250910"," I'm going to do spy SPX ES."
"3251770","3253590"," Then I'll do the Qs NQ."
"3254230","3257650"," I'll do IWM and RTY, depending on what you're trading. "
"3258270","3259350"," Get your notepads out."
"3259350","3260210"," All right."
"3260910","3261690"," Get your notepads out. "
"3261770","3263210"," If you're watching right now, get your notepads out."
"3263330","3264690"," It's important for you to have."
"3265230","3269630"," I want you to understand that these are some zones that you need to know about. "
"3270290","3270730"," Okay."
"3271570","3273090"," So we're going to go over that right now."
"3277400","3279760"," So returning back to some market commentary. "

"3288120","3291500"," I think I think it was March."
"3292960","3295440"," I think the first 1% decline."
"3295820","3297020"," I think it was I think it was March. "
"3297200","3297760"," I don't think it was April."
"3297980","3299620"," If it was April, it was like April 1st."
"3300060","3300980"," I was looking at it this morning. "
"3301200","3302980"," I'm like, this is the biggest decline since late March."
"3303960","3306940"," We're on track for the biggest decline since late March."

"3344980","3347640"," I actually think it's 447 50 or 440."
"3348200","3349120"," Possibly even 440."
"3350320","3353800"," Maybe 445 on spy. "
"3354160","3354800"," I'd like to see."
"3355020","3359960"," I'd really like to see like a smash down here and break through briefly."
"3360480","3363860"," So I'd like to see like 446 maybe somewhere in there. "
"3363940","3365000"," I'd like to see that smash through."

"3438470","3440970"," For your hourly and then to the downside."
"3442250","3448690"," You're likely going to be at 4300 or 4320 by the time we get there."
"3449530","3450310"," On spy. "
"3453450","3454630"," You can see that right there."
"3454650","3458770"," I want to see that nice little nice little bounce down there and then that nice little."
"3459190","3460630"," There's a failure right there. "
"3461230","3464830"," If you failed that, then you'd have that nice little bloodbath right there."
"3464990","3465630"," See it."
"3466290","3472170"," If we don't get the failure and you get to hold above then where we go into some big upside"
"3472170","3472770"," up there. "
"3473510","3473830"," Right."
"3474370","3474970"," That's a yes."

"3504560","3506320"," Possibly even 380 up here."
"3506820","3508820"," That's a nice, nice look right there, by the way. "
"3509700","3514040"," Nice place to buy the dip cues showing you the way to the upside."
"3514860","3522480"," If the cues break 37344 and hold underneath it."
"3522480","3524580"," It's actually cues look really nice right now. "

"3582040","3587370"," At any point you start to see blood rejection."
"3590080","3594480"," You're going to be looking for a correction in NASDAQ and cues."

"3818220","3819660"," We're chasing you there right now, man."
"3819820","3821620"," Chase is like closing out all his shorts. "
"3822600","3825520"," So you can reposition on the upside up here at 454."

"3877340","3882980"," We have a website we're trying to launch and it's requiring me to."
"3883220","3889760"," Now, I can't put the stream up either because I'm using all of these monitors. "
"3889760","3893240"," So my complete computer set up."
"3893320","3899020"," I'm using all the monitors in meetings with Google Meet with like three to five people."
"3899500","3903280"," And then I am running tests in the background. "
"3904100","3906260"," So I need the computing power as well."
"3906700","3907840"," So I do apologize."
"3911280","3912140"," PT three. "
"3913600","3919940"," I guess maybe I could do the stream with just like a shitty weebel chart or something."
"3920580","3921920"," Let me see if I can do that."
"3922260","3926880"," I'll run a test stream tonight and see if I can do like a shitty stream in the background or"
"3926880","3927160"," something. "
"3928320","3929860"," So here's PT three right now."
"3929980","3931780"," And then you're going to be looking for a failure up here."
"3932500","3933540"," Some kind of a failure. "
"3937140","3943650"," If you're a bear, you'll give them some kind of a failure up there."
"3956050","3958410"," You all DTM, I was wondering about that too."
"3958430","3961810"," So I was talking to Joe to Joe Donut. "
"3961950","3964030"," And I was like, or George has somebody and I was like."
"3964030","3967250"," I wonder if the stream is not up."
"3967370","3971670"," If they're going to say, yeah, I don't need that or I do need that to trade or not. "
"3971950","3974210"," So I was like, I wonder if that is real or not."
"3975170","3975790"," How about this?"
"3977990","3978590"," Let me know."
"3978670","3980210"," Does it matter if the stream is up or not?"
"3980570","3981110"," I don't know. "
"3981330","3983510"," I don't know if it's if you need the stream or not."
"3983950","3987190"," It seems like I feel like I give you guys enough information that you don't need."
"3988310","3989150"," The stream up. "
"3989290","3990110"," But if I'm wrong on that."
"3991530","3992030"," Say it."
"3992170","3996390"," I'll give it half to maybe I'll just put it up on a, on like a weeble. "
"3996790","4000450"," I won't do it with everything on there, but you'll have at least the stream to talk with them on"
"4000450","4000970"," each other."
"4005240","4007140"," I press like everyone to save the bears."
"4013380","4019570"," Yeah, the discord is what so that's what that's what the admins told me. "
"4019630","4021270"," I was in a meeting with the admins and they were like."
"4022350","4026190"," Whenever you don't stream the discord, the discord just comes together and starts trading together."
"4026730","4028110"," So I think that's fucking awesome. "
"4030270","4031070"," You need the stream?"
"4031070","4031530"," Okay."
"4032710","4033290"," Let me see."
"4033410","4034270"," I think I have to. "
"4034430","4036630"," I think I won't be here another couple days this week."
"4037210","4040310"," I have a big meeting with attorneys coming up."
"4042010","4045610"," We've got a bunch of like contractual stuff that still hasn't been worked out. "
"4045730","4046650"," That needs to be worked out."
"4048030","4050710"," We've got a long these are all like people."
"4051090","4052610"," So I want you guys to understand that. "
"4053950","4058190"," You and I trade all day long nine to four and a lot of these people in the background."
"4059130","4059970"," They don't trade."
"4060490","4065330"," So they're there are hours that they're available is during the market hours. "
"4066910","4069470"," So maybe I'll just make sure there's some kind of a stream up."
"4069750","4074730"," I'll try to set that up on a different computer tonight so that it's so that it's always running no"
"4074730","4075190"," matter what."
"4079060","4080200"," Yeah, the stream totally helps. "
"4080500","4080680"," Okay."
"4081240","4081900"," I got you."
"4082160","4083140"," I'm reading what you guys are saying. "
"4085970","4087270"," What's the deal with the pullback today?"
"4087270","4090330"," Give me a second here."
"4090350","4090930"," I'm going to check something."
"4092570","4094090"," Give me a second here. "
"4094870","4096529"," Let me look at something here."
"4104790","4106450"," Let me see if."
"4113439","4114979"," Maybe one second here. "
"4118600","4120520"," I hope I didn't fucking delete this by accident."
"4121540","4124300"," I had a private stream for the discord this weekend."
"4128279","4129319"," And okay. "
"4129640","4130380"," So here's the deal."
"4133689","4134890"," Give me one second here."
"4139010","4139290"," Yeah. "
"4140550","4141109"," Okay."

"4152210","4152490"," Okay. "
"4152870","4152950"," So."
"4155390","4156950"," Inside the discord."
"4161910","4163790"," I'm going to post a link. "
"4167399","4170340"," Give me one quick second here."
"4170880","4171760"," Hold on here."
"4180600","4181680"," You know, I am impressed. "
"4181899","4184640"," I got to say that I am impressed with the discord and."
"4186399","4187279"," It's showing."
"4188979","4190920"," What it what it what it's meant to be. "
"4244110","4244630"," Okay."
"4244850","4246790"," So I put a link to the Sunday stream."
"4248850","4252210"," Inside the discord on the in the trading floor room. "
"4252970","4254890"," So if you missed that stream."
"4256750","4258670"," And if you missed that stream."
"4260970","4262570"," There's a link to it in the discord. "
"4263310","4265190"," And I go over."
"4265830","4268470"," The expectation of violence to come."
"4269190","4270630"," Which is what we have today. "
"4270750","4271750"," You have some violence."
"4273130","4276570"," So now that stream was not to be bearish."
"4277310","4279390"," It was just you're going to expect this. "
"4279890","4282970"," To begin to happen in the coming weeks and months."
"4283550","4285510"," I think along it takes for us to get up there."
"4286450","4287490"," Oh, look at that. "
"4287710","4287790"," Huh?"
"4288850","4290290"," Cranky bears up here, huh?"
"4291090","4291690"," Cranky bears."
"4294320","4295380"," Stinky bears up here."
"4295520","4296580"," Look at them all stinky. "
"4306570","4309210"," Oh, at least hot hot sauce sellers up in here."
"4309350","4311290"," They're like, no, you're not going to get this."
"4312830","4314670"," We're going to revenge straight and go down. "
"4317230","4320550"," All I want to do is get back on this train and ride this at this PT too."
"4320650","4324700"," So just a second here and we'll watch this."
"4334460","4338820"," You like to tell me with coke around his mouth scratching his neck when the stream is it up. "
"4341040","4342680"," Matt Phillips said the stream is amazing."
"4342740","4346780"," I'm like Dave Chappelle meme with the coke around his mouth scratching his neck when the stream"
"4346780","4347240"," isn't up."
"4347360","4347700"," Shit. "
"4349000","4349580"," All right."
"4349780","4349900"," All right."
"4350220","4351280"," They'll always be a stream up. "
"4357830","4358970"," Maybe one second here."
"4385010","4388150"," I'm going to say they got a producer's text to me right now."
"4398980","4400440"," Can I stream at the discord?"
"4400900","4402200"," No, I didn't want to make this. "
"4402520","4405700"," The reason I made that private that video private was multifold."
"4406460","4409660"," It's a bonus to people that are actually active in the discord."
"4410920","4415960"," And the time and effort that the members put into that discord, I appreciate. "
"4416380","4417640"," I want you to know that."
"4418360","4419580"," It's a good question, by the way."
"4420040","4425040"," I want you to know that I appreciate the time and effort inside put into the discord. "
"4425520","4427560"," I appreciate people that spend their time in the discord."
"4429060","4431360"," The discord is not secondary to the stream."
"4431360","4435680"," It is as important as the stream in my view. "
"4436400","4437780"," It's like a companion piece."
"4438440","4439820"," You get the stream."
"4439980","4440680"," You get the discord. "
"4440800","4442820"," You'll get the website and you should get enough."
"4443100","4449500"," You should have enough information there to one of my biggest pet peeves is Twitter."
"4449900","4451240"," Like I got a problem with Twitter. "
"4451500","4453040"," I got a problem with news."
"4453920","4461340"," I have a problem with."
"4462040","4464800"," Going to for your long or short market. "
"4465920","4468820"," And there's a lot of death and destruction comes from."
"4469380","4474460"," There's a lot of information out there that by the time you get it is bad news for you to"
"4474460","4474980"," be consuming."
"4475900","4478020"," So as a trader, as an investor. "
"4479840","4480960"," I'm looking for."
"4481740","4488120"," Like what tools like a can't services that I paid for services that I still pay for right now."
"4488940","4490300"," Can't get like a definitive. "
"4490940","4493760"," This is going to help me in my trading journey."
"4494020","4497720"," So for me, that video was for the discord."
"4498040","4500160"," Now the second reason I didn't make that video public. "
"4500400","4501620"," There's a second and third reason I think."
"4501620","4505520"," But another reason I didn't make that video public was because they didn't want to panic."
"4506260","4507640"," The general population. "
"4508180","4509920"," It's kind of like an edge that you have, right?"
"4510340","4511000"," I can't have."
"4511380","4516280"," I don't want people to watch that video and say, Oh, cap super bearish."
"4517040","4523020"," And then make an impact on Twitter or Reddit or anywhere else where people like this guy is saying,"
"4523380","4524940"," this guy is bearish right now. "
"4525580","4529200"," And create like a panic in the disco."
"4530380","4532860"," So and what kind of how bearish am I?"
"4534980","4536660"," Do we expect a role?"
"4537380","4538380"," How deep is that role?"
"4538820","4542040"," And I don't want to contribute to that publicly."
"4542040","4548300"," So it's for it's for people that are in the inner circle like I guess the right inner circle of"
"4548300","4548460"," people. "
"4548460","4551120"," You say here, consume this chew on it."
"4554460","4562120"," And and be or don't don't don't don't wake up shocked one morning in the markets down and be like,"
"4562120","4563720"," I didn't see this coming."
"4570700","4574820"," Yeah, so that's that's for inside the discord if you guys want to see it. "
"4575820","4576540"," Discord's awesome."
"4576680","4582820"," Discord's taken the discord has taken two years to get where we want it."
"4583020","4583980"," And it's there now. "
"4584300","4585400"," It is fucking there."
"4585520","4586720"," It is an amazing fucking place."
"4587000","4590300"," So it's running like a fucking a well oiled machine. "
"4590740","4591980"," I am so impressed with it."
"4592100","4598020"," So I have zero problems saying I think it's one of the best discords out there."
"4598200","4603700"," So I've been in many discords and that this discord to me is one of the best that I've seen. "
"4603700","4612430"," So yeah, I respect it even though you're bearish."
"4612570","4613110"," I like bears."
"4613410","4614810"," I like bears like sellers like buyers. "
"4615250","4616270"," I get it."
"4622880","4624140"," Can I stream in the discord?"
"4624420","4628300"," I used to stream in the discord, but it has all kinds of fucking problems."
"4628720","4634080"," Like you're only allowed so many people to watch the stream and then people would fight amongst"
"4634080","4637060"," each other of who was able to get into the stream inside the discord. "
"4638520","4642660"," Maybe there's a way that to stream into the discord that I don't know about where everybody can"
"4642660","4643060"," watch it."
"4643120","4649720"," If anybody knows how I can multi stream inside the discord so that everybody can watch."
"4649880","4652540"," Let me know because I think there's limits. "
"4654020","4656200"," But if I'm wrong on that, correct me."
"4656980","4658940"," I remember that I used was two things."
"4659120","4662600"," They used to stream to the discord and I think we ran into two issues. "
"4663120","4670000"," The first one was, I believe there was a limit on how many people could actually watch that stream"
"4670000","4670380"," in the discord."
"4670560","4672020"," And then there's a delay, I think, too."
"4673320","4673720"," Let me know. "
"4673840","4674760"," Let me know if I'm wrong on that."
"4675440","4676280"," We used to do that."
"4679130","4681130"," So you come in from your treasury secretary. "
"4681290","4687990"," Oh, so Shaquni is saying there are limits, but someone can't restream your stream so more people"
"4687990","4688490"," can watch."
"4689370","4690970"," They're doing the Biden administration."
"4692630","4695370"," Someone saying some puts getting moved into Friday right now. "
"4696230","4698730"," The debt ceiling deal included more than one."
"4698910","4699310"," Let me know."
"4699850","4701610"," I remember we used to do it. "
"4701690","4703370"," I don't recall why we stopped doing it."
"4703570","4708470"," I don't recall the reason for that dynamic and innovative economy here in the long term with the"
"4708470","4710490"," world's strongest financial system."
"4710990","4711850"," Yeah, I'm here. "
"4711970","4712110"," Thanks."
"4712690","4715850"," You're a moderator."
"4716530","4720390"," We're going to have to remove his moderator in lots of us. "
"4720650","4720730"," Thanks."
"4724450","4727210"," This is all, this is all violent right here."
"4727330","4729470"," He's like, roll this thing down right now to the depths"
"4729470","4740470"," of"
"4740470","4740470"," hell. "
"4741310","4742870"," Chase is all super gnarly."
"4742950","4744330"," You already got your PT one right here."
"4747660","4748320"," Here you go. "
"4748420","4748560"," Chase."
"4748760","4749180"," Hold on, brother."
"4753580","4754780"," Here's your PT one. "
"4756140","4757720"," Chase is like cereal."
"4759540","4760820"," Here's your PT two."
"4769570","4771090"," Here's your PT three. "
"4773110","4776510"," Chase is like a moderator and he sounds like Chase, man."
"4776670","4778470"," You bet it can't be too crazy, brother."
"4782010","4782970"," Here's PT four. "
"4783090","4783270"," Chase."
"4785860","4787240"," And there's your daily trigger brother."
"4787400","4788680"," I'll always put that up for you. "
"4790160","4792480"," There's your blood into the close trade."
"4793020","4793160"," Chase."
"4804760","4805200"," Let's go. "
"4805300","4806760"," Let's go back to the credit rating stuff."
"4807960","4809940"," We do have to talk about that in more depth."
"4810480","4810940"," Good question. "
"4811120","4811820"," Who asked that question?"
"4815820","4818920"," Basra asked how serious do I think the credit rating stuff is."
"4821050","4822490"," It is serious."
"4823370","4824810"," We have to talk about that. "
"4826630","4830650"," I'm going to put on the main street hat for a moment."
"4832030","4837290"," I'm going to switch between hats, trader hat, main street hats."
"4839430","4843090"," How do I word this?"
"4845250","4850390"," Is the credit rating stuff, so I got my main street hat on right now. "
"4850910","4852190"," Is the credit rating stuff important?"
"4852190","4852550"," Yes."
"4854570","4855410"," It's important."
"4856650","4862590"," And not only is it important, but remember when we were going through the debt-sailing stuff and we"
"4862590","4871890"," discussed on the show how they were going to discuss court and doing away"
"4871890","4876490"," with this second negotiation for more money, basically, right?"
"4877470","4879710"," And as soon as it was resolved, what happened?"
"4879710","4885290"," Do they continue down the path of ensuring that we don't ever go through this again?"
"4885590","4886150"," No. "
"4888950","4891670"," And you'll see that from both Republicans and Democrats."
"4893090","4902610"," Neither side ever wants to get or not have this renegotiation, this"
"4902610","4904330"," debt-sailing renegotiation."
"4904570","4905010"," They love it. "
"4905850","4911110"," It's more pork, it's more money, it's more I get what I want to give you what you want."
"4913390","4916070"," You know, this is how we described it."
"4916170","4924310"," We said it's kind of like my wife and I discussing our budget in our home, right?"
"4925070","4926630"," So we discussed what our budget is going to be. "
"4928130","4929710"," And we make plans."
"4929770","4938590"," My wife says, I want $10,000 to spend on my American Express every month when I go, fine."
"4939830","4944250"," So every month that bill comes in and I'm paying down that 10th. "
"4944290","4948030"," I guess the better way would say would be not my monthly bill for AMEX, but my yearly bill."
"4948150","4949370"," I tend to only pay it every year."
"4950430","4951170"," It's 10 grand. "
"4951670","4952170"," This is for 10."
"4952430","4953430"," Don't be out there saying AMEX."
"4953590","4954710"," You're going to pay it every month, all that kind of shit. "
"4955450","4956190"," It depends a year."
"4956310","4957390"," It depends a year at the pay."
"4957470","4959170"," It's a zero percent of as long as I pay it for a year. "
"4959890","4960030"," Okay."
"4961310","4963210"," And she come, we spend that $10,000."
"4963570","4968490"," She's pissing it away on handbags and fucking shoes and it's $100,000. "
"4969310","4970830"," Pissed it away in handbags and shoes."
"4971590","4976990"," The newest puzzle, handbag, cost her $6,000."
"4977210","4979950"," And she went out there and she bought a new Jimmy Choo shoes. "
"4981370","4984570"," And the year comes up to pay that bill."
"4985390","4989110"," And we sit down at the table and I go, okay, we're going to pay that bill."
"4990090","4991510"," And my wife says to me, no, we're not. "
"4992830","4993690"," I go, what do you mean?"
"4993990","4994810"," We already discussed it."
"4995470","4996650"," We're going to pay that $100,000 bill."
"4996650","4999270"," And she goes, well, I'm unwilling to pay it. "
"5000110","5002390"," Unless you meet some new demands of mine."
"5002990","5004450"," That's the debt ceiling, right?"
"5004810","5005630"," Basically, that's it."
"5006590","5007090"," Now. "
"5008770","5013810"," It's actually, you know, if I don't, I'm disagreeing to pay $100,000 off cap."
"5014850","5016090"," We're going to ruin our credit."
"5016270","5019890"," If you don't give me an upgrade to $200,000 to spend now. "
"5020930","5025950"," So now husband and wife, you know, if a husband and wife are doing that, that's just going to end"
"5025950","5026730"," in divorce, right?"
"5026930","5027850"," You know, that shouldn't go last."
"5028630","5032930"," You know that eventually we're going to fight over this and we're going to get a divorce and we're"
"5032930","5034230"," going to go our separate ways, right?"
"5035910","5037950"," You know, that's a dysfunctional relationship."
"5038190","5042930"," Now, you know that the Senate, they're married, not by choice, right?"
"5043850","5045230"," They love that shit. "
"5045810","5050510"," They love having to go back to the table to pay that bill and say, fuck you, let's renegotiate."
"5051710","5060230"," It's intended to some extent for our Senate or all, not all forms, but the Senate and the house to"
"5060230","5062010"," have that dysfunctional relationship."
"5062530","5067650"," It's original thesis was not a lot happens and not a lot gets done. "
"5069730","5071490"," By having those renegotiations."
"5071770","5075130"," Now, of course, now it's turned into a poor fest, right?"
"5075790","5081070"," They're sucking each other off, sucking themselves off, and they're all just hitting the ship or"
"5081070","5082070"," the pig trough."
"5082270","5088990"," Just to make our users aware of continuing tomorrow with Amazon and Apple printing their Q2 and Q3"
"5088990","5089810"," numbers respectively. "
"5090790","5094470"," So just as the nearly heads up, our very intern is going to be going over the fundamentals"
"5094470","5096010"," surrounding these names."
"5096890","5098990"," So the link to the live video is available on the feed."
"5099270","5102410"," It's due to be starting again tomorrow at 3.30 p.m. Eastern time. "
"5102410","5111090"," So when you're talking about our government, right, we shouldn't have this renegotiation if we're"
"5111090","5111990"," going to pay our bills or not."
"5113650","5118090"," So the downgrade from Fitch has their claiming, the Main Street Hat, right?"
"5119070","5120610"," Claiming has something to do with this."
"5121930","5127070"," There's also reports out that the insurrection has to do with this. "
"5128170","5131310"," More than likely Main Street Hat right now."
"5132030","5140210"," More than likely, I did have a chance to read the entire last indictment for Donald Trump, previous"
"5140210","5140650"," president."
"5141630","5148150"," And more than likely, from what I read in that indictment, there's going to be stuff that comes out"
"5148150","5157510"," from that indictment that's Watergate-esque and is not a good moment for the country. "
"5157510","5161830"," Regardless of what you think about Trump, like him, hate him, I don't care."
"5162050","5162990"," This is Main Street Hat, okay?"
"5163890","5171390"," You're going to have a lot of shit dragged through in public that is going to be a tarnish to"
"5171390","5173330"," the sovereignty of the United States of America."
"5175310","5182550"," And they don't want to see, because it did leak that part of the reason was because of the"
"5182550","5182810"," insurrection. "
"5182810","5187850"," And in these indictments, they're going to have some more information come out about election"
"5187850","5188550"," fraud, right?"
"5189910","5192050"," So this is all makes people weary."
"5192350","5193750"," People don't want to see these things."
"5194070","5198410"," So you've got a multi-fold thing here with the downgrade. "
"5199170","5202410"," You've got out of control spending."
"5202730","5203270"," We know that."
"5203670","5209550"," We also know that we have some indictments coming down or came down right for a previous president. "
"5210190","5214130"," We also know that we had an insurrection or a riot at the Capitol."
"5214690","5223710"," Those are all things that make you question your government, believe it or not."
"5223810","5226810"," Regardless of what your take is on it, whether you're for it against it, if you thought it was just"
"5226810","5227950"," people getting together, I don't care. "
"5228750","5231470"," This is the sober outside entity."
"5231470","5235330"," Now, that entity that made that pitch, those pitch boys, right?"
"5235590","5238950"," They also have their own motivations too for that downgrade."
"5240310","5247150"," And part of those motivations are because of where bonds are and where bonds are looking to be"
"5247150","5247370"," heading. "
"5248130","5249270"," Bonds aren't looking good."
"5250010","5251410"," They're looking really sketchy, right?"
"5251650","5252850"," Very dangerous, very bad."
"5253770","5258470"," Some real heavy-duty selling coming into high-quality bonds. "
"5259290","5268130"," So they have motivation as well to move money from the S&P 500 over to the bond market"
"5268130","5271690"," to get some kind of migration over there."
"5272490","5278330"," You also have powerful people that have shorts in this market as we're coming in to this all-time"
"5278330","5279750"," highs, right?"
"5280390","5285190"," So you've got motivations from these companies as to why they're doing what they're doing."
"5285190","5285990"," Some of it is real. "
"5286630","5290190"," That's the main street hat stuff, and then some of it is likely geared more towards the bond"
"5290190","5295670"," market, saving the bond market, and the fact that we're coming into all-time highs."
"5295930","5298130"," These are big players with big money and big power."
"5298550","5300290"," These are people that you'll never meet in your life. "
"5300730","5302190"," An entity that you'll never meet in your life."
"5302270","5304430"," Now, the S&P hasn't given a downgrade."
"5305270","5310930"," That's where we got our large pushdown inside in 2011. "
"5310930","5311910"," Do you guys know that?"
"5312250","5318810"," That it was the S&P downgrade, the standard in poor downgrade that actually made our market go to"
"5318810","5319490"," the depths of hell."
"5319930","5321270"," Do you guys realize that?"
"5321910","5326230"," And we haven't gotten that downgrade yet from the S&P, from standard in poor."
"5327210","5332670"," Now, if that downgrade were to follow and come along as well, I'm going to then slap my trader hat"
"5332670","5334310"," on and say, oh shit, we're fucked. "
"5335110","5335970"," Fitch doing it."
"5337490","5344030"," Not as concerned as a trader hat."
"5344530","5348450"," Not as concerned as if the standard in poor gave us the downgrade. "
"5349190","5351230"," I think some of this is politically motivated."
"5353090","5355170"," I'm not going to blame Republicans for this either."
"5355470","5357470"," I'm a Democrat, whether you know, I don't know if you know this or not. "
"5358390","5365170"," My main street hat has the urge to blame the urge to blame Republicans, but I can't."
"5365590","5368230"," And I blame the Democrats just as much as the Republicans."
"5369230","5371830"," I don't fucking trust either of them. "
"5372190","5377950"," When we talk about the main street hat politics, I don't, they're the greediest, most monstrous"
"5377950","5379470"," power sucking motherfuckers."
"5381430","5387430"," They're the most, as you get older, you're going to realize that these people are fucking monsters."
"5388970","5392830"," And it is a fucking trough for all of them. "
"5393250","5395530"," Every fucking one of them."
"5395690","5396810"," They're the world's best traders."
"5397470","5398470"," They're the world's best investors. "
"5399350","5402050"," They're family members of the world's best traders and investors."
"5402050","5405730"," This is all about money, power, clout and ego."
"5405930","5409390"," It's like raging fucking ego about these people. "
"5410590","5413050"," So for my main street hat, I'm like, Fitch doing that."
"5413150","5415730"," I'm like, yeah, I kind of like that, that downgrade."
"5416610","5422730"," My main street hat is like, fuck, I mean, what does it take for these people to stop renegotiating"
"5422730","5423030"," our debt?"
"5423390","5428810"," Like, like they were saying they were going to stop this debt, selling bullshit in the future, then"
"5428810","5431930"," it just went away until the next time it becomes an issue again. "
"5432730","5434730"," So that part of it, I want to see that solved."
"5435610","5437750"," My main street hat is like, I don't want to see this."
"5437890","5438950"," That means we're one of what?"
"5439210","5440470"," Three countries, I think, that do this. "
"5441090","5442470"," So I don't want to see that anymore."
"5444550","5444910"," Personally."
"5445290","5451590"," Now my trader hat is like, yeah, this looks more like trying to save the bond market and it looks"
"5451590","5458510"," more like just an excuse for a pullback that we kind of know is coming because of where we are"
"5458510","5459390"," on the stock market. "
"5459390","5461470"," And then you're going to assign it to anything."
"5461750","5471710"," Now, if you see the S&P downgrade, do a downgrade of our bond rating, then you're"
"5471710","5474830"," going to see actual destruction in the stock market."
"5475030","5477270"," You start to see that kind of stuff happen publicly. "
"5477590","5479930"," I would think that my trader hat would become fearful."
"5481010","5484290"," Now my trader hat is not fearful right now in this Fitch downgrade."
"5485330","5492990"," My trader hat is my spider senses are telling me they're preparing the market for all time highs. "
"5493730","5498550"," They want you to begin to move that money over as we get up there."
"5499850","5505070"," And that moving that kind of money, like when we start getting up there to those all time highs,"
"5505510","5507310"," it's going to take a lot to move that money."
"5507470","5510270"," This isn't something where it takes one fucking day. "
"5511150","5515930"," You know, you're not going to get the entire fucking stock market to say, yeah, I'm going to wrap"
"5515930","5521370"," up my all my all my money inside this market and move it all over for you by by fucking"
"5521370","5522430"," 8 a.m. on Thursday."
"5523070","5523850"," Does it make sense?"
"5524870","5527850"," So it's the beginning of the process of topping."
"5528410","5534850"," It's the beginning of the process of start to look for places to exit the market as we get up"
"5534850","5537750"," there and look and hey, by the way, we're Fitch. "
"5538870","5539850"," Look at bonds."
"5541330","5545390"," You know, you can start to you can start to make this mass migration over."
"5546310","5552050"," Into bonds even the bottoming process in our market took what six months or something right took"
"5552050","5552390"," time. "
"5552870","5557850"," And like that bottoming took time this topping is not going to be one day."
"5558010","5567730"," If you're a bear, I apologize to you."
"5567730","5569110"," I was exited the S&P 500. "
"5569490","5570150"," It's not it's not happening."
"5571350","5575650"," Maybe you have like a one percent chance of that happening."
"5577490","5582170"," One percent five percent, maybe, maybe five, you'd need like, you need all these other agencies to"
"5582170","5587170"," start to hit us with negative credit ratings and stuff like that. "
"5587330","5589330"," So, no, I disagree."
"5589750","5592750"," When I trade her head on, I disagree that it's that panic moment."
"5593070","5593570"," Maybe it is. "
"5594450","5595810"," We'll know if it is, though."
"5596510","5602230"," And even if we do have that panic moments, you're going to know or have the ability to get out"
"5602230","5602850"," at some point."
"5603270","5604710"," You will be given that opportunity. "
"5605610","5609190"," We could blast down tomorrow to four thousand."
"5609710","5615330"," And it would still rip back up higher and have that that last little breather to get out of the"
"5615330","5616110"," tax of the market."
"5621170","5621470"," Hey. "
"5623090","5624410"," Really something I was saying."
"5627580","5628800"," Can we get it like that?"
"5628960","5629360"," I don't know."
"5637590","5639970"," You know, there was also funny about that, too. "
"5640810","5646490"," What John Hagerty just said was you could see the role coming before the pitch news came out."
"5646490","5652490"," So they know before we knew did Yellen already know before the news came out."
"5653170","5654250"," I saw that yelling shit. "
"5654390","5655150"," That was a disaster."
"5656430","5659050"," Like she blows she blows my mind."
"5670070","5672290"," Yeah, the politics of it all. "
"5673810","5676390"," I'm not going to get into the politics of what it means."
"5676670","5680650"," Or not going to get into like the he said she said with Trump and Pence and all that kind"
"5680650","5680870"," of stuff."
"5680990","5681410"," You guys can. "
"5681570","5685450"," I'm not going to because I really when it comes to like trading and stuff."
"5685550","5686210"," I really don't care."
"5686770","5690450"," What I care about as a trader is how it impacts the market. "
"5691070","5696130"," And as that dirty laundry is exposed, it's going to it's going to tarnish the United States, right?"
"5696610","5698510"," Whether it's true, false doesn't matter."
"5699690","5701470"," There will be an impact on this on the market."
"5708150","5713190"," Yeah, you know, I agree with with Hagerty saying the downgrads controls government spending. "
"5713350","5717070"," I read that and rank leadership and competence across the board."
"5717070","5720530"," I think you're you're like."
"5721870","5725310"," You know that all of these politicians do this shit, right?"
"5725510","5726150"," They all do it. "
"5726770","5729610"," All of them, Democratic, public and they all do this shit."
"5729770","5731090"," All of them do this really nasty shit."
"5731090","5733670"," When it becomes public is when there's a problem. "
"5733670","5734430"," Does that make sense?"
"5735330","5738150"," So if it becomes public, it's a fucking problem."
"5739430","5741770"," Doesn't matter if they're Democrats or Republicans or whatever."
"5742070","5745310"," The moment that it's exposed publicly, there's going to be an issue. "
"5745790","5748050"," And Fitch is politically motivated as well, right?"
"5748190","5748810"," We know that too."
"5749350","5751830"," And we know that Fitch doesn't want to deal with that bullshit either."
"5752030","5755890"," And they're watching the slap fighting and all the shit that's going on in the house and in the"
"5755890","5756130"," Senate. "
"5756650","5758330"," And they're like, what the fuck is going on?"
"5758330","5761830"," Like we have to keep the veil of secrecy."
"5762850","5763770"," You know, powerful people."
"5764250","5768350"," If you're powerful, you don't want, you don't air your dirty laundry publicly. "
"5768730","5769930"," And that's what's happening right now."
"5776420","5779180"," Now, this has more to do with like, think about it like this."
"5779960","5781240"," Think about it like a family. "
"5782200","5786140"," If you are in a family, if you have a family of you and your best friend."
"5786300","5787560"," Let's say you're like, I'm not married, cap."
"5788820","5793660"," Think about your extended family and you have your immediate family. "
"5793660","5798840"," Your immediate family could be, I don't know if any of you guys took sociology in college, but your"
"5798840","5802600"," immediate family could be just your roommate that you live with."
"5802940","5805340"," It could be your only friend that you have out there."
"5806340","5809180"," You don't air your dirty laundry to the public, do you?"
"5810280","5814720"," And regardless of what it is, good, bad and different, you don't air your dirty laundry. "
"5814900","5819040"," When you do air your dirty laundry to the public, nothing really good comes of it."
"5819760","5825760"," If you think that you should be airing your dirty laundry from your family out in the open to the"
"5825760","5829260"," public, think again, that is not a good thing for you to do."
"5829320","5831200"," You can go out and get counseling for your family. "
"5831740","5835820"," You can go out and bring in family members that you trust in your extended family to come help."
"5836360","5837420"," You can bring the police."
"5838300","5840200"," Let's say you're in a domestic violence situation. "
"5840780","5845580"," You call the police, the police come to the house and they remove your wife or your husband."
"5845580","5849520"," But you don't go out and see your neighbors and tell them, yeah, my wife did this and it was"
"5849520","5849780"," terrible."
"5850280","5853600"," And then go to work and tell everybody there what your wife did and all that kind of stuff. "
"5853720","5859060"," You keep that stuff kind of close and only into the group of people that is involved in what you're"
"5859060","5859380"," doing."
"5860220","5864940"," So when you're seeing this publicly, some of this stuff that's coming out public or impacting the"
"5864940","5866120"," public, it's not a good thing."
"5866920","5868240"," Regardless of who's doing it. "
"5868540","5868960"," Make sense?"
"5873380","5881340"," Yeah, I had a nice Disney trade on."
"5881340","5882860"," I took that trade for profit."
"5883080","5883380"," We got up. "
"5883500","5885080"," It was almost in the money."
"5885140","5886200"," It was like 90% there."
"5887860","5891080"," I don't trust Disney into their actual report though. "
"5891900","5894480"," So I'd be very wary of Disney in their actual report."
"5897780","5898740"," Oh shit."
"5907160","5911760"," Yeah, the market was the market was clear as day yesterday that yesterday we were going down today. "
"5912100","5914020"," Thursday at nine 30 in the morning told you."
"5914400","5918040"," You got the confirmation at like three in the afternoon 350 or something like that."
"5921090","5921670"," Yeah, yeah. "
"5921910","5922530"," No, it's not."
"5922750","5923650"," Yeah, it's kind of weird thing."
"5924090","5924430"," It's not. "
"5924590","5925470"," You get what I'm saying."
"5925470","5929630"," And so when you're seeing that, you're like, Hey, what the fuck is going on?"
"5929810","5932470"," Like who the fuck has opened the door into what we're doing?"
"5933270","5933570"," Right?"
"5934310","5935550"," Like don't be doing that."
"5936290","5937170"," Now we're airing. "
"5937410","5938110"," Now you got indictments."
"5938150","5939870"," Now we've got exposed."
"5940350","5944930"," The thing about this too is, you know, when you start to see this stuff in a court of law,"
"5945210","5946870"," it's going to drag people through the mud. "
"5946870","5947730"," You guys know that, right?"
"5947730","5953210"," It's going to drag like you're like, I thought that person was not involved or this person is a"
"5953210","5953430"," Democrat."
"5953910","5960110"," You know, they will, they will attempt to drag people through the mud as this stuff goes to court."
"5960210","5962170"," It'll be a smudger on the United States of America. "
"5967720","5969980"," Seems like we're looking for a tracement to sell further."
"5970220","5971280"," I'm not in any trade right now."
"5971420","5972640"," So the only thing. "
"5972840","5974220"," So I've got my investment accounts."
"5974880","5978860"," I've got some, I've got some puts on the market for the 11th."
"5979620","5982460"," I've got no, no, no zero dates, nothing like that. "
"5982640","5983940"," Day trades out there and all that kind of stuff."
"5986260","5987580"," So I think we're going down."
"5987980","5990560"," Yeah, if you get the rejection here, we can buy some more puts to the downside. "
"5991360","5992240"," We're going to look for right now."
"6006260","6010820"," Yeah, airing out your dirty laundry during a divorce is like never good."
"6011340","6013080"," People don't view you well. "
"6016860","6018400"," They don't, they don't view you well."
"6020500","6024140"," My sister went through a, my sister went through a nasty divorce."
"6024560","6025480"," They never end well. "
"6025660","6029560"," It never, it never benefits anyone that was involved."
"6031280","6035620"," The more, the more clean that you make those things, the easier it is across the board."
"6041260","6042040"," Smudge is an understatement. "
"6042540","6042720"," I agree."
"6042900","6043060"," I agree."
"6044560","6044700"," All right. "
"6044820","6045820"," I'll look at Tesla right now."
"6046400","6047780"," So we talked about Tesla."
"6050120","6052260"," That 162 or not. "
"6052400","6052760"," Sorry."
"6052900","6053400"," Hold on a second here."
"6054320","6055640"," I said 162. "
"6057240","6060060"," The 262 right is a fucking magnet."
"6060400","6060500"," Right."
"6060780","6062420"," You see that 262 is like. "
"6064980","6066900"," Not an easy thing to shake."
"6067240","6068160"," It would be a really good."
"6068180","6069160"," This is a really good. "
"6070520","6077760"," It's a really good."
"6078520","6083400"," Watching how strong that daily trigger is right on a bullish ticker."
"6083620","6088320"," You don't like that daily trigger is like that's our, that's, that's what we're keeping. "
"6088640","6088720"," Right."
"6090120","6093200"," What's even more fascinating is that the weekly trigger."
"6094420","6095920"," Is very emotional. "
"6096580","6100540"," It's a very emotional place for bulls and bears and."
"6101620","6103400"," The direction of Tesla."
"6103400","6110240"," Now one fascinating thing is as time passes that weekly is coming up like a giant shark underneath. "
"6111420","6121330"," I want to buy that right"
"6121330","6121590"," now."
"6121670","6123130"," So I want to buy that so fucking bad."
"6123830","6127070"," I want to buy this one right here really, really fucking bad right here. "
"6128410","6129450"," Really bad."
"6130030","6131750"," Really want to buy that right there."
"6132810","6136030"," Get my, I'm getting, getting all bullish here. "
"6139590","6140810"," I'm not getting bearish here."
"6140810","6141990"," I'm getting extremely bullish."
"6143930","6144790"," So Tesla. "
"6147090","6148830"," Dude, I'm bullish here, by the way."
"6149450","6150170"," I'm extremely bullish."
"6150750","6151050"," So Tesla. "
"6152070","6153150"," Here's the Tesla chart."
"6155170","6156150"," You see that, right?"
"6156370","6158990"," It's like once it wants to hold it wants to hold it wants to hold it."
"6159110","6159170"," Yeah. "
"6159390","6161610"," Maybe we can close or fail to close this stuff to the upside."
"6162730","6166370"," We talked about wanting to see the weekly get tagged."
"6166610","6167410"," It's actually coming up. "
"6168790","6171930"," Right now it's at a 225 by next week."
"6171950","6173210"," It should be at a 232."
"6175470","6176990"," And it's still bullish. "
"6177450","6179130"," The monthly is coming up bullish, right?"
"6180410","6180610"," Bullish."
"6182850","6183370"," Bullish."
"6184010","6184710"," Not bearish bullish. "
"6185810","6189530"," Little bit of a role though showing itself right here today."
"6189930","6190030"," Right?"
"6190310","6190570"," Look at that."
"6192150","6193210"," A little bit of. "
"6193390","6197770"," Yeah, we're a little bit more bearish here on Tesla to the downside."
"6199730","6201230"," 224 228 222."
"6202310","6204210"," What is this implying here to you?"
"6204970","6209050"," This is implying that we've got what we've got ready for this. "
"6211940","6213760"," What do we have happening here?"
"6213920","6215800"," What are we, what can we divine from this?"
"6216820","6221780"," And that is that we have the rest of this week for."
"6224080","6227290"," Earnings, right?"
"6227450","6228290"," What is it telling you here?"
"6229090","6230750"," It's telling you a couple of things."
"6230870","6236250"," It's telling you that we are wrapping up. "
"6237310","6239390"," Big tech earnings, right?"
"6240690","6242550"," We're wrapping up big tech earnings."
"6245970","6248510"," We got Amazon reporting on Thursday after the bell."

"6275350","6276330"," Dominion energy."
"6276690","6276870"," Frontier. "
"6277230","6280330"," We got a bunch of big reports coming out."
"6281690","6284630"," That to an extent wraps up earnings week."
"6286430","6289190"," What is Tesla telling you about this?"
"6289390","6291490"," Tesla's earnings were like Starbucks earnings. "
"6291770","6292070"," They were good."
"6292410","6292890"," They weren't bad."
"6293930","6294610"," They weren't great. "
"6296770","6300530"," But it does kind of show you, hey, if we wrap stuff up and we come into the end of"
"6300530","6305510"," the week, you're going to be looking for a nice dip to buy in Tesla."
"6305990","6306490"," You get what I'm saying?"
"6308070","6309490"," So earnings were good."
"6309730","6311790"," Earning season so far has been good overall. "
"6312390","6312690"," Right?"
"6312910","6313230"," Even Starbucks."
"6314850","6315910"," Fucking cranking, man."
"6316050","6317270"," They went up 12%. "
"6317270","6317610"," Right?"
"6319470","6320470"," And they had expansion in China."
"6320770","6321510"," This is all good stuff."
"6321710","6322850"," The expectations were through the roof. "
"6323610","6324550"," They missed by what?"
"6325510","6326110"," See here."
"6326970","6328030"," But they didn't really miss anything."
"6328450","6329630"," They were great fucking earnings. "
"6330250","6332810"," So you're going to look for another dip to buy in Starbucks."
"6333370","6333490"," Right?"
"6334130","6335390"," Same thing goes for Tesla."
"6336250","6341150"," It's not a question of if Tesla is a great buy or Tesla didn't or did have a great earnings"
"6341150","6341610"," season. "
"6342010","6344410"," It's more a function of, hey, we wrote it up."
"6344570","6345670"," Buhu, yeah, it's fucking awesome."
"6345910","6347130"," Came back down about another dip. "
"6347730","6348750"," Same kind of deal, right?"
"6349190","6352510"," Looking for a nice fat place to buy Tesla."
"6353310","6355850"," What's another part of Tesla we talk about around here?"
"6356070","6360090"," And that is Tesla loves to trade on its daily velocity."
"6360830","6362250"," Whether it's going up or down, doesn't matter. "
"6363310","6366570"," Tesla's always loved to be bought down here on Lowe's."
"6366730","6368210"," We're not quite there yet, are we?"
"6368650","6370470"," Almost there, but not quite."
"6371610","6381170"," I'm not as, I'm not as, I don't care as much of where price is. "
"6381690","6390130"," I don't care as much as if Tesla just grinds and then the weekly comes up and eventually meets for"
"6390130","6392510"," that nice swooping big trade in Tesla."
"6393310","6398650"," Or if it blasts down and then we get the dip bounce down there."
"6398730","6404830"," Either way, I'm looking for that, that daily fellow to be kind of negative and we're not quite"
"6404830","6405590"," there yet. "
"6406190","6409630"," Now, how do I get bullish on Tesla again?"
"6410670","6418510"," Either that time for it to come down or it begins to once again regain the hourly and daily trigger"
"6418510","6420690"," and confirms the move higher."
"6421130","6423910"," So I'm not long, I don't want to be long in Tesla right now."
"6424550","6430170"," Must we get back up and regain 265 and you're above weekly or daily and early velocity. "
"6430690","6437670"," Or we come down and tag weekly velocity down here at 225 to 230 somewhere down in there."
"6438370","6440610"," So until something, either of those two things happen."
"6441090","6445790"," I have no need or wants to buy Tesla right now. "
"6445790","6452240"," So there's Tesla for you."
"6452480","6454400"," Is there a trade in Tesla for you?"
"6454620","6454740"," No."
"6455760","6456120"," Absolutely. "
"6456420","6457300"," I don't believe so."
"6457380","6458680"," Maybe you can get the tick on it."
"6458840","6459820"," I don't care about the tick. "
"6460720","6467320"," That larger run should present itself with price above hourly and daily trigger or time passing and"
"6467320","6468420"," the weekly coming up from underneath."
"6469500","6470360"," One or the other."
"6474170","6480890"," And the fact that we have the big reports coming out on Thursday and Friday, you're likely going to"
"6480890","6487070"," see after Thursday and Friday some kind of, let's take the money and run. "
"6489030","6493090"," Also another note here too, Apple, they don't normally rip until the day of their earnings."
"6493410","6494610"," So Thursday for Apple."
"6496290","6498810"," I like the idea of Apple ripping all day long on Thursday. "
"6507090","6508350"," They call it trading the swamp."
"6508390","6509590"," Is that Omar saying that?"
"6512230","6516910"," Yeah, they'll be a part of, I think they'll be a part of taking the money."
"6517290","6521930"," If you're, I've already been looking at my, my, my, I'm looking at my investment account. "
"6522110","6527110"," I'm like, yeah, probably going to stop start exiting into Friday."
"6527110","6528990"," Some of this stuff we're going to do a show."
"6530090","6530730"," I believe Friday. "
"6531890","6536930"," We're going to look at my investment accounts and we're going to start talking about taking some"
"6536930","6540990"," money off, heading into our Thursday or Friday to even be tomorrow."
"6543210","6546610"," Taking some, some money off the top and leaving some runners on."
"6547570","6550830"," And China, China, China just enjoy some of the profit. "
"6551630","6552550"," So we're getting close."
"6553710","6555230"," They call it trading the swamp Omar."
"6555570","6556310"," Jesus Christ. "
"6559210","6563870"," No, I've got no interest in Nicola."
"6563870","6565930"," Nicola, no interest."
"6567530","6568810"," I was, you know, it's weird. "
"6568870","6569430"," I never traded."
"6569630","6570850"," I never traded Nicola."
"6572210","6573490"," It's meteoric rise. "
"6574650","6578790"," I was really upset though that they were done dirty, man."
"6579130","6580930"," Those Nicola investors were done fucking dirty."
"6582190","6585490"," They were done dirty right down to the fucking admins of their Reddit. "
"6585870","6586550"," They're subreddit."
"6586870","6589830"," They really fucking were done fucking dirty."
"6590470","6595550"," So I will never, ever be a, you'll never see me talk about Nicola in any way, shape or form. "
"6595830","6597610"," I don't give a fuck who owns them or buys them or whatever."
"6607680","6608800"," Oh, yeah, I own PayPal."
"6609880","6611320"," I own PayPal, so I'm interested. "
"6613120","6615400"," You guys want to try PayPal out from the end of the day today?"
"6615580","6616320"," We can do that right now."
"6622090","6624990"," Three hundred and sixty five thousand puts."
"6626010","6627870"," You guys are fucking maniacs. "
"6629650","6633730"," You guys say that, you guys say that, dude, you just like tomorrow for fifty P."
"6635210","6636650"," You guys got a hundred and fifteen."
"6636810","6639350"," You guys are, you guys have bought all the puts in the mark."
"6639510","6640350"," You guys are animals. "
"6641410","6642610"," Fucking bears, dude."
"6644330","6645650"," They own all the puts."
"6648850","6649650"," Fucking savages. "
"6652210","6655730"," I'm looking in the, I'm looking in the, I'm looking right now."
"6655890","6657510"," They got fucking all the puts in the world."
"6658310","6659870"," I don't know if these are bears though. "
"6660010","6662910"," My assumption is this is people that own the underlying market."
"6664210","6666810"," I think these are bulls, not bears."
"6669170","6670130"," My God. "
"6671870","6674510"," You guys have every put in the fucking mark."
"6674990","6676230"," Like you got, it's weird too."
"6676290","6681130"," I'm looking at the, they blame, they blame retailers for doing this. "
"6681230","6681670"," This isn't retailers."
"6682170","6682890"," I'm looking at it right now."
"6683290","6686590"," These are fucking, these are fucking, these are fucking HFTs. "
"6686590","6688410"," They do all that put buying."
"6690730","6694610"," Three hundred and sixty five thousand four fifty P's expiring for today."
"6698880","6700820"," So right here, I want you to see that. "
"6700860","6702220"," See this four fifty three up here."
"6702320","6711060"," Let's write that in four fifty three or eight here."
"6711160","6711300"," Ready?"
"6713300","6716520"," There are three hundred and sixty five thousand zero dates. "
"6720180","6721220"," Zero DTEs."
"6724240","6727800"," Or four fifty, oh, it's four fifty C."
"6728080","6729200"," Okay, or four fifty P."
"6729880","6730640"," That's not too bad."
"6731320","6732360"," They can get that actually. "
"6734440","6735640"," Where is that right down here?"
"6741240","6742900"," Yeah, they can, they can actually hit that."
"6750120","6755600"," They're, they're in the money here for a minute."
"6758200","6761900"," I'm interested to see if they leave them on right into the closing bell here. "
"6763340","6764660"," They'll let these things go in the money."
"6764900","6765720"," I don't think that they do."
"6766080","6767420"," It's very rare when they do. "
"6767600","6768460"," So if they do, they do."
"6777540","6778460"," It's savages."
"6779240","6784100"," I'm looking down, I'm looking like tomorrow's strikes Friday strikes and they, they bought them"
"6784100","6784180"," all. "
"6784320","6786520"," They've got all Friday strikes Thursday strikes."
"6787680","6789760"," They own all the puts in the market right now."
"6800590","6801810"," Yeah, it's not retail. "
"6802010","6803250"," It's not retailers that do it."
"6804170","6808910"," I know that the common zeitgeist says that it is, but it's not."
"6810070","6812930"," It's not, it's not retailers doing this. "
"6812930","6821910"," This is likely HFTs and funds that are along the market underlying and they're hedging themselves"
"6821910","6822530"," right now."
"6823250","6824550"," With cheap puts dealers too."
"6825090","6829920"," So you likely see futures get bought here too. "
"6830260","6834490"," So fair chance of futures getting bought."
"6839670","6841370"," Let's look at PayPal really quick."
"6845920","6847320"," We're not going to look at that one. "
"6852530","6853230"," Just a second here."
"6862260","6864380"," PayPal with a bounce off its weekly trigger."
"6865640","6868240"," It's daily is coming up from underneath. "
"6869160","6871300"," Man, I'm bullish on PayPal here."
"6872840","6873720"," Kinda."
"6878260","6879060"," I'll say this. "
"6883360","6885320"," PayPal is another good."
"6886360","6895670"," PayPal is another good candidate for a strangle."
"6898210","6904580"," I'll tell you what, man, like PayPal is it's got its hourly. "
"6905160","6906780"," Let's take a look at PayPal really quick."
"6907120","6913200"," A little bit of blood right now in the market."
"6913920","6915560"," So this is PayPal right now. "
"6918130","6920950"," It's currently bearish into its clothes here."
"6923480","6926300"," How to nice bounce on its weekly."
"6926600","6928920"," This is a very emotional place for for PayPal. "
"6930500","6933860"," It could induce panic if it has a bad report today."
"6939380","6940660"," That's a nice run, dude."
"6940920","6942320"," This thing had a fucking gorgeous run. "
"6942480","6942980"," Look at that run."
"6944800","6945940"," Fucking stellar run."
"6947120","6948960"," And this is what I'm talking about. "
"6949000","6951060"," I'm going to show you their last ER."
"6957870","6958730"," How emotional."
"6961760","6963400"," This is their last ER right here. "
"6963660","6965580"," And it fucking rained blood."
"6967120","6970840"," I'm going to almost guarantee that this was an outsized move."
"6971100","6973120"," This is what I was talking about earlier about coin. "
"6974940","6977580"," And you would see something again like that."
"6977880","6980280"," You would definitely see all this get retraced."
"6982380","6983800"," 73 bucks right now. "
"6985180","6987660"," You would also see that giant retracement."
"6988860","6991460"," Let me look at this on a different chart here from the back."
"6991620","6992260"," Let me look at somewhere else. "
"6992840","6995340"," Let me look at a different chart on PayPal really quick."
"7001290","7002050"," One second here."
"7004660","7005920"," It'll look on a higher time frame. "
"7020120","7021180"," I have to look at PayPal."
"7026570","7028070"," I'm kind of scared right now."
"7029250","7049930"," I might have to buy some PayPal puts, but now I'm"
"7049930","7050750"," bullish here in PayPal. "
"7061490","7063510"," I own PayPal from that bloodbath."
"7075260","7076160"," I'm looking at it."
"7079060","7095230"," It's weekly and it's monthly is saying it's monthly"
"7095230","7095750"," is not. "
"7095990","7098610"," It's monthly is coming up."
"7103860","7105640"," It's weekly is not looking too hot."
"7116680","7117160"," Hmm. "
"7119220","7120240"," Can't tell here."
"7121160","7121680"," Let me check."
"7121900","7123460"," It's a implied move for today. "
"7126750","7131930"," It reminds me of Starbucks like when I have to fucking exit after the bell on it."
"7132370","7133530"," If it's an ugly report."
"7142060","7143320"," Catching a bounce right now. "
"7145840","7154210"," You have to watch this one closely to weekly is not giving me too much faith and it's daily is"
"7154210","7155310"," not giving me too much faith."
"7155770","7158090"," They will drop this fucking thing down to the depths of health."
"7158090","7159010"," They don't get a good report. "
"7164160","7166180"," They will drop it like a fucking bad habit."
"7166180","7168940"," Dude, I'm looking at it right now in a higher time frame and I'm like shit."
"7169420","7172220"," I fucking hate walking the plank on earnings. "
"7181010","7184510"," I'm like watching PayPal right now and I'm like, you are so suspect."
"7190040","7194060"," Yeah, three hundred and three hundred and sixty five thousand zero dates."
"7194640","7195680"," Now three seventy. "
"7196300","7197680"," It's not the three seventy right now."
"7203450","7210470"," Yeah, I think I have to do is I think I have to."
"7211270","7215190"," There's like blood and then snap back up and then exit if they have a shitty fucking. "
"7216470","7217870"," They have any kind of like misses."
"7219830","7221470"," Like the beats aren't good enough, right?"
"7221710","7224490"," You need the beat and you need the expectation beat too."
"7233050","7234070"," That's what I think, Binky. "
"7234970","7235710"," That's what I think."
"7239010","7240890"," I think you're smoking crack if we get down here."
"7243810","7244210"," It happens. "
"7244730","7245130"," It's just rare."
"7247410","7248850"," Happens like ten percent of the time."
"7257220","7257920"," Fucking PayPal. "
"7259300","7260220"," Hold on a second here."
"7260240","7261020"," I got to open up an account."
"7261240","7291700"," I got"
"7293140","7293480"," it open. "
"7298170","7298630"," What's that?"
"7298810","7300630"," I'm going to chart out PayPal here for you."
"7300870","7343440"," Not detached"
"7343440","7344780"," grid."
"7362270","7364990"," Leave that open for you right now in the background. "
"7365290","7372210"," I'm going to chart out the background here."
"7372330","7379520"," I'm going to chart out PayPal and then I'll show it to you guys into this close."
"7392180","7393340"," One second in the background. "
"7393420","7394040"," I got to do some work."
"7401680","7404540"," Seven point five percent expected move."
"7424700","7426380"," Seventy eight sixty nine. "
"7433960","7435640"," Seventy eight sixty nine."
"7444540","7445820"," Oh, it's seventy eight sixty."
"7454150","7456190"," Someone's going to get wrecked on this one. "
"7458510","7459510"," Hands down."
"7459770","7461070"," Someone's going to get wrecked on this one."
"7473460","7475500"," Seven point five per two. "
"7475500","7487220"," Just a strangle is going"
"7487220","7487900"," to fucking print."
"7488220","7489140"," That is fuck."
"7490100","7492040"," It doesn't matter which side prints. "
"7495000","7498400"," Well, a little bit different on this one than coin."
"7500300","7501860"," It's eight point two six."
"7525200","7527300"," I can move right down there. "
"7534620","7535640"," Two sixteen."
"7560900","7562040"," Just a second here."
"7562760","7564900"," I'll chart this up for you. "
"7645640","7646540"," There's PayPal."
"7654030","7656270"," Weekly trigger, daily trigger down here."
"7657570","7659010"," Hourly triggers up at seventy four forty. "
"7659510","7664310"," You got a gap above here at seventy five thirty six."
"7664530","7665730"," Somebody got a gap right here."
"7677420","7680400"," The expected move to the upside is quite significant. "
"7681040","7682060"," Seventy eight fifty eight."
"7683800","7687180"," This event looks priced in sixty twenty six."
"7687560","7690700"," This event, the options chain looks priced in. "
"7691100","7693000"," It's a pretty severe move."
"7695260","7696840"," To the up and down side."
"7697080","7698860"," Their last ER they sold. "
"7700540","7703080"," Now they did sell on their last ER."
"7703080","7709410"," As they were approaching their weekly trigger."
"7709810","7716390"," Now we were bearish on PayPal on their last ER. "
"7717190","7719670"," They were trading on our we were trading with a downward."
"7720250","7723550"," We were trading on the weekly and the daily trigger to the downside."
"7724230","7726230"," You got your capitulation trade there. "
"7726730","7730110"," Some a little bit more bullish here on this PayPal earnings."
"7731310","7734670"," Though I wouldn't be surprised to see."
"7736910","7742760"," Some kind of a some kind of at least a push down initially. "
"7744180","7748580"," And then something like this and then your upside move there."
"7749520","7752100"," Personally I'm bullish here on PayPal."
"7752900","7759260"," I own PayPal just as a word of caution or not caution, but you know, I'm going to have a"
"7759260","7760820"," bias here that's going up. "
"7763520","7766380"," I'm not exactly panicky here."
"7766580","7767580"," I'm going to have that."
"7767680","7770680"," I'm going to have it open just in case we get bad news. "
"7770680","7772720"," The big deal for me would be."
"7773720","7778080"," Any kind of rejection off of that daily trigger and that weekly trigger."
"7778540","7783640"," So the one my one fair here, but what I don't want to see is. "
"7785080","7787000"," Any kind of rejection down here."
"7790720","7794040"," I will exit my position if at any point."
"7795320","7797240"," There's any kind of this going on here. "
"7797540","7798480"," Anything like this."
"7799400","7804840"," Any kind of bad news and rejection rejection town like that red or something."
"7806900","7807420"," Differentiate. "
"7809000","7811140"," I'm okay with all this action in here."
"7812260","7813300"," Anything like this."
"7813480","7813960"," I'm good to go. "
"7814660","7817360"," Any kind of rejection down here at 7 150."
"7817660","7819460"," I'm going to put a stop loss on in right now."
"7820040","7820980"," Just in case. "
"7822420","7823560"," Let me just second here."
"7870820","7872700"," Man, it's kind of weird too."
"7872900","7874100"," Like so now I'm looking at like. "
"7886650","7893210"," Man, dude, like even like the upside for Friday calls are stupid expensive right now."
"7894190","7895110"," Friday calls."
"7896150","7896790"," Stupid expensive. "
"7905950","7909470"," Calls for tomorrow are very expensive calls for Friday are very expensive."
"7909890","7910290"," Just a warning."
"7911250","7912890"," So regardless of what happens in here. "
"7913930","7916130"," The dealer saying we are going up."
"7917030","7918330"," Thursday and Friday."
"7918990","7919370"," So we'll see. "
"7920950","7922570"," Calls are not cheap right now."
"7922750","7923990"," They're cheap right now for today."
"7924070","7926950"," They are very expensive for. "
"7928270","7929550"," Thursday and Friday."
"7930350","7931930"," I'm going to look at Apple real quick too."
"7932070","7932650"," Hold on a second here. "
"7934800","7938700"," I wonder if I have to trade the actual underlying and not the indexes here."
"7946410","7948350"," Apple's parked on its daily trigger right now."
"7949190","7950650"," Bounced on its daily trigger. "
"7955320","7959500"," I wonder if I have to trade a set of trade and spy trading."
"7973390","7973950"," 4765."
"7978540","7979680"," I think just patience. "
"7991560","7993860"," So here's a this is PayPal over here."
"7994000","7997880"," I'm going to bring book map back up for you until the end of the day."
"7998780","8003880"," I think my thought process here is I'm looking at spy calls for Friday. "
"8004820","8005180"," And."
"8007400","8014100"," I'd like to see like an after the market fair from PayPal and then a dip by for Friday in"
"8014100","8014300"," here."
"8017160","8019200"," So I'm looking for some spy calls. "
"8019980","8024220"," Maybe we get a bloodbath for 15 minutes or so."
"8024800","8027620"," I don't want to pay with their asking me to pay for spy calls right now."
"8028280","8028740"," For Friday. "
"8029520","8031280"," Tomorrow calls are expensive as fuck."
"8033120","8038000"," So I'm going to be patient here and wait until four o'clock or four oh five."
"8038580","8041920"," Four oh one and see if there's any kind of blood at four oh one down here. "
"8044000","8045200"," Zero dates for today."
"8045800","8050460"," I'm interested in those as well, but still not still not what I want to see."
"8050740","8056420"," We hit that PT one up here and blood down no continuation. "
"8058080","8059560"," To the upside as of yet."
"8059580","8062780"," So if I'm looking for zero dates right now, I want to see the same kind of thing."
"8063420","8065040"," I want to see that cross there. "
"8065360","8070740"," I want to see back up and hit this and begin to take calls right in here somewhere."
"8070740","8076580"," Just know still no zero day calls and no Friday calls either right now."
"8086840","8089820"," I haven't looked at I haven't looked at Vicksit today. "
"8090340","8091560"," Let me take a look right now."
"8096330","8097970"," You see what the market's saying."
"8101160","8102380"," Yeah, he tried you looks Bush. "
"8104060","8104580"," Dixie."
"8108260","8109600"," See Dixie here."
"8116990","8119470"," I wonder if I can bring the snapshot this and give you guys this. "
"8119770","8122290"," Yeah, like Dixie needs to come back down and confirm."
"8125030","8128210"," Confirm one oh one sixty three for us to get in a bear town."
"8128290","8129970"," A big, big role in the market. "
"8131530","8133450"," Now as Dixie looking actually bullish."
"8135150","8136430"," Apple's looking bullish here."
"8137690","8138710"," Tesla's looking bullish. "
"8139570","8142110"," Vicks looks like it's bullish right now."
"8142250","8143390"," I agree with you on the Vicks looking bullish."
"8144450","8146090"," They've got a Vicks has some. "
"8146690","8148490"," Some gap to close above."
"8153790","8155650"," And a sixteen twenty four."
"8161230","8163130"," Sixteen twenty three somewhere in there. "
"8165030","8167530"," Vicks has some more gap to close, but otherwise."
"8172370","8176970"," Otherwise it looks like it looks like Dixie needs to roll over and just test."
"8179390","8181610"," It's trading one oh two fifty nine right now. "
"8181750","8182490"," I do want to give you a warning."
"8182570","8183010"," I don't know if you can."
"8183190","8185550"," I don't know if you can see this on every. "
"8186410","8187370"," I don't think you can see this here."
"8187370","8190590"," But so I've got another instance of Webull on a different computer."
"8191430","8196750"," And I want you to know that anything above one oh five eighty eight anything above there. "
"8197129","8198450"," That's known selling."
"8199049","8200709"," So when your charts at home."
"8201650","8203469"," Snap like a big fat box. "
"8205309","8210230"," Up around one oh four seventy eight to one oh five forty three."
"8211670","8215209"," You want your a bull you need to see selling there."
"8215209","8216469"," You have to. "
"8216889","8222469"," If you don't get selling there we will roll down to the weekly trigger on spoos."
"8223270","8227770"," So that's going to be an important place for the market to sell."
"8230290","8232030"," Dixie has it makes its way up there. "
"8232230","8235469"," You're going to want to see a seller step in up there."
"8241160","8242620"," And rain that shit back down."
"8242840","8245760"," You do not want to see like we tag one oh five. "
"8246700","8250340"," Forty three then roll down and confirm on."
"8252219","8254879"," One oh three sixty three and start to march higher."
"8255620","8257299"," That would be a no go. "
"8257860","8259260"," I'm sitting and draw that here."
"8260680","8262740"," You know I've had to post this Dixie chart."
"8263700","8265740"," For you in the discord later today. "
"8270410","8273110"," It's not give you an idea as to what to be looking for."

"8318100","8322100"," Joe do you see the do you see how bullish Netflix looks right now."
"8323180","8324879"," You're pretty fucking sexy isn't it."
"8326520","8328059"," I think tech has a good day tomorrow. "
"8328480","8330400"," I'm on the I'm on tech going up tomorrow."
"8331299","8333620"," I'm on a big fucking run for tech tomorrow."

"8342520","8343719"," What's going on Joey."
"8344840","8346379"," I know I know I know."
"8351680","8353680"," I'm bullish on Netflix here Joey. "
"8354200","8356260"," Joe's like Joe's like the perfect bull."
"8357040","8360540"," He's likely please get the pullback on Netflix so I can buy more."
"8362360","8365120"," Joe's like I buy Netflix at a 380 please. "
"8377840","8383680"," You don't want to buy 380 on Netflix."
"8386559","8387880"," You just wanted 407."
"8388920","8391940"," I think I think that bears going to wake up tomorrow with a."
"8393420","8397240"," I don't think bears knows what know what's coming with the earnings on Thursday. "
"8397240","8400480"," I don't think they realize they were probably getting a fucking major trend day."
"8401440","8406280"," I'm looking at tomorrow and Friday's calls and they are not fucking cheap."
"8407420","8409560"," They are like paid a party. "
"8411760","8413720"," They are definitely paid a party."
"8417320","8420610"," But you're not greedy."
"8422010","8423730"," No Netflix is sitting. "
"8424350","8429530"," So Netflix currently right now is sitting directly on its daily trigger."
"8430250","8433750"," It's looking to confirm bullish move higher."
"8433750","8435190"," It's sitting on its hourly. "
"8435950","8436990"," It's daily."
"8437450","8438850"," It's one in five minute right now."
"8439410","8441050"," It's consolidating to the upside. "
"8441310","8441670"," It's holding."
"8442370","8443450"," It's daily."
"8443990","8448870"," So to me it's very bullish right now where it's a extremely bullish. "
"8452360","8453000"," NVDA."
"8455560","8457640"," Let me look at NVDA."
"8458380","8459280"," Right here. "
"8459420","8460000"," Right where it is."
"8462820","8464500"," NVDA wants to party right here."
"8465240","8470180"," It wants to trade right from where it's at to a four fifty five minimum. "
"8471580","8472100"," Minimum."
"8473620","8476060"," So I want you to know I'm not bearish here."
"8477260","8478280"," I'll be honest with you. "
"8478580","8479520"," If you guys want to know."
"8480800","8481840"," Not bearish."
"8483600","8484840"," Very bullish here. "
"8487810","8489990"," Everything in the market says is screaming bullish."
"8490870","8492490"," It's screaming for Dixie for a pullback."
"8494150","8496370"," H.Y.G. looks like it wants to fuck to the upside. "
"8498730","8504730"," Vix has a little bit more of a gap to close but it's topping right at the top ish more"
"8504730","8505450"," than the downish."
"8506230","8507930"," Dixie is my real concern here."
"8509190","8511110"," Maybe we can do a quick look at Dixie. "
"8517840","8520140"," I mean if you're looking for a place to buy we're close right."
"8521100","8522880"," The only thing I would say is something here."
"8523140","8528920"," Let's talk about NVDA though because I'm saying I'm bullish here but I'll be honest with you. "
"8528920","8530040"," I mean I got to be upfront with you."
"8530140","8531420"," Like this is full disclosure."
"8532160","8533460"," So we're going to look at Dixie. "
"8533660","8536220"," We're going to get Nvidia as the example."
"8536640","8538060"," So I want to be honest with you a hundred percent."
"8540840","8543320"," Even though I'm so this is NVDA. "
"8545320","8547460"," So to me this is a dip buy."
"8548980","8551920"," Now it's risky buying a dip here on NVDA."
"8552980","8556700"," What you should be looking for to buy the dip on NVDA. "
"8559040","8560500"," This is a 30 minute chart."
"8560700","8570510"," I'll go to a one minute chart because I will just do it like this."
"8571990","8579730"," So I'm going to show you what I would be looking for to go along. "
"8579930","8581930"," Now you guys like putting more risk on than I do."
"8582990","8584890"," So I'm going to tell you this right now."
"8585110","8586150"," Okay I'm going to show you something here. "
"8588030","8589890"," So NVDA is now trading above."
"8590050","8590410"," It's one minute."
"8590650","8591170"," It's five minutes. "
"8591170","8593550"," That's bullish in a short in the short term."
"8593830","8594570"," Okay just so you know."
"8594990","8597150"," Let me see if I can delete some of this stuff here. "
"8598430","8600430"," So just currently right now."
"8600950","8603010"," NVDA is trading above."
"8603190","8603990"," It's one in five minutes. "
"8604250","8604870"," That is bullish."
"8605630","8606710"," It had a successful bond."
"8606970","8607870"," It's a daily trigger. "
"8608870","8612110"," So where am I bullish to as long as price stays above."
"8612890","8615650"," As long as price stays above 44327."
"8616770","8620550"," I have a target here of let's call it 454. "
"8621390","8622090"," Okay."
"8623470","8626490"," I have a price right here 454 on NVDA."
"8626830","8627050"," Okay. "
"8627970","8628230"," But."
"8630720","8631860"," Overall thesis."
"8634510","8635630"," I'm not looking for that. "
"8636130","8639050"," Overall thesis to be actually bullish on."
"8641170","8641870"," NVDA."
"8656010","8658130"," I want to see that hold. "
"8659210","8659710"," You know what I'm saying."
"8660910","8663390"," I don't want to see another rejection up here."
"8663390","8665790"," And we start to bloodbath it back down. "
"8665910","8666950"," Isn't that beautiful right there."
"8667370","8668070"," Fucking gorgeous."
"8668570","8669930"," It's like perfect buying. "
"8670730","8672170"," It's like perfect dip buy time."
"8673330","8674930"," But I want you to see like."
"8675510","8677490"," For you to get bullish to get on NVDA. "
"8678010","8679630"," You need to have the break above."
"8680690","8680790"," Right."
"8681850","8683030"," And then you need to have. "
"8684090","8685290"," The successful bounce."
"8686410","8688590"," And then it begin to move higher again."
"8690550","8692510"," So where do you take that trade. "
"8693390","8696690"," There really is no trade for a bull on NVDA."
"8696890","8698150"," Until you get the break above."
"8698910","8701950"," The successful confirmation and then the then the trade higher. "
"8702330","8702470"," So."
"8703370","8706350"," I'd really like to see NVDA regain 450."
"8707150","8709150"," Hold it and begin to make its way higher. "
"8709870","8711970"," So that you can say correction is over."
"8712290","8712730"," Makes sense."
"8714090","8716590"," So just just as a ward of warning here. "
"8717070","8717630"," You can."
"8718250","8720850"," You can be bullish here on NVDA right."
"8720850","8723590"," Or NVDA here. "
"8723750","8725690"," You can be bullish as long as we stay above."
"8726710","8727670"," 441 17."
"8728290","8729110"," You can be bullish. "
"8730090","8730910"," And video right now."
"8731810","8734330"," I would be looking to take profit around 454."
"8735130","8736430"," 455 somewhere in there. "
"8739050","8739650"," Excuse me."
"8739730","8740890"," 454 52."
"8741390","8742330"," I'd be looking to take profit. "
"8742570","8743850"," Even if it squeezes up in trades."
"8744130","8745350"," 455 even for 60."
"8745950","8747190"," Even if it trades that. "
"8747450","8747990"," I'd be looking to."
"8748090","8749330"," Maybe leave a runner or two on."
"8749890","8754310"," My real my real like where I really want to see is this hold. "
"8755610","8759070"," Because I can get behind price above daily."
"8759450","8762130"," I can get behind price above hourly."
"8762430","8764810"," I can get behind price above the one and five minute. "
"8765110","8767330"," And say hey we've got four trigger cluster."
"8768390","8770870"," And video is going to go back up there and fuck around on the upside."
"8772110","8775110"," And try to fail that that new high again up there. "
"8775910","8777870"," Because there's a bigger trade here right."
"8778850","8780530"," There's actually a bigger trade."
"8782230","8783050"," Right here. "
"8783210","8783930"," Even if it fails."
"8784210","8785970"," There's a substantial trade right here."
"8786310","8786430"," So. "
"8789330","8790250"," One trade."
"8790730","8792650"," Two trades on NVDA."
"8792810","8793790"," My concern though. "
"8794770","8797350"," Also lies in these reports right."
"8797490","8798310"," You got PayPal coming."
"8798470","8800210"," You got Amazon coming at Apple coming. "
"8800650","8802050"," If you get a bad PayPal report."
"8802290","8803290"," A bad Amazon report."
"8803530","8804390"," A bad Apple report. "
"8805610","8807070"," You are going to see."
"8808130","8810550"," Bulls take their winnings right."
"8810790","8814250"," You're going to take their money and they're going to exit tech and look for other opportunities. "
"8815350","8817650"," So just be you have to be nimble here if you're a bull."
"8818650","8819530"," Extremely nimble here."
"8819830","8820630"," I put that to high. "
"8821330","8823770"," It would be to like be like four fifty six eighty."
"8824470","8826630"," I said four sixty but I meant four eighty right in here."
"8830120","8830920"," You get what I'm saying. "
"8831240","8831800"," So there's like."
"8832620","8833660"," Tax full bull."
"8834900","8835520"," Makes sense. "
"8836020","8836540"," Tax full bull."
"8842350","8843630"," You got to be attacked full bull."
"8850820","8852800"," NVDA squeezing right now. "
"8853220","8854500"," Thought to explode to the upside."
"8858010","8860350"," These fucking bears are pissed baby."
"8860770","8862530"," Get on up there spoos. "
"8862970","8864770"," Start fucking squeezing."
"8865570","8870240"," If you're a fun take your fucking heads off."
"8875520","8877680"," We're going to watch PayPal after the bell. "
"8880520","8882420"," They all look the same."
"8886550","8887010"," Are you serious?"
"8889400","8891780"," Some sort of threat reported at the Senate."
"8892020","8892840"," I don't believe that shit. "
"8895300","8896900"," I always love that shit."
"8897260","8899540"," So let's just create shit on fintuit."
"8901460","8902860"," Play some bullshit news. "
"8903600","8910880"," They're like oh shit."
"8911120","8913700"," Captain James is back on streaming buying zero day calls."
"8914640","8915380"," Just kidding. "
"8915920","8916920"," It's not why we're going up."
"8918760","8919700"," So yeah."
"8920020","8922220"," NVDA looks bullish. "
"8923400","8924720"," Everything looks bullish right now."
"8924920","8929300"," All the tech spy calls are being priced to the upside for Thursday and Friday."
"8929580","8930280"," I am bullish here. "
"8930960","8932760"," And I think you're out of your fucking skull."
"8933260","8936160"," If you think that Apple and Amazon are going to sell into their earnings."
"8936820","8938260"," I think they're going to rip faces off tomorrow. "
"8939160","8939640"," Sorry."
"8941560","8945240"," All you need is Apple to talk about AI tomorrow and it shit is over."
"8945240","8948720"," So you'd be out of your fucking mind to be shorting that tomorrow. "
"8949780","8951780"," Out of your out of your fucking mind."
"8952340","8962320"," The video that I posted there"
"8962320","8963060"," is from Sunday."
"8963840","8968540"," The video that I posted inside Discord on the traders. "
"8969500","8972580"," Trading floor is the one that was from Sunday I believe."
"8973100","8974040"," I think that was from Sunday."
"8980040","8982220"," Do you know you're taking the hedge off?"
"8982460","8983320"," You know you are. "
"8985230","8986670"," It doesn't matter much."
"8986670","8987810"," I agree with that."
"8987810","8989710"," You want to see I'm going to. "
"8989790","8991790"," So Jamie Diamond just said it doesn't matter much."
"8991790","8992630"," I'm going to tell you guys some."
"8993590","8996350"," If standard and poor does the downgrade. "
"8997410","8998430"," Watch the fuck out."
"8998710","8999870"," Like that's the one that matters."
"9001530","9002590"," I assure you. "
"9003170","9005930"," It's the standard and poor downgrade that you don't want to see."
"9006610","9007330"," The fifth one."
"9007850","9010090"," Probably some kind of politics in there. "
"9011850","9015090"," There's definitely some politics in that in that downgrade."
"9019280","9020740"," I think you can short apple."
"9021820","9022780"," Into their clothes. "
"9024640","9027360"," I don't I think you're out of your fucking skull if you try to short it."
"9027460","9029200"," Of the day of their earnings."
"9029520","9031620"," It's like the day like tomorrow for apple. "
"9032180","9032860"," Fuck no."
"9034220","9035100"," I wouldn't."
"9035720","9037440"," I would want nothing to do with it. "
"9038400","9039300"," This is zero."
"9040040","9042140"," But if you're like I want a short apple earnings."
"9043080","9045680"," I would say fucking or if I want to buy puts on apple earnings. "
"9046720","9050540"," I would I personally would wait until the close or like I would wait to like."
"9051320","9054120"," Two thirty three thirty in the afternoon to start considering it."
"9054520","9055660"," And see where prices. "
"9057120","9058660"," I personally wouldn't do it."
"9059040","9060540"," Just as a general rule tomorrow."
"9060540","9061800"," I wouldn't fuck around with it. "
"9065780","9069560"," Just like a just like a like a trader log going back many decades."
"9069880","9071980"," The last day like the day of their earnings."
"9073100","9078170"," Yeah, I wouldn't do it. "
"9080010","9083370"," Maybe that maybe it like three forty five three fifty."
"9091960","9095300"," Yeah, I'm speaking I'm speaking in very short term here."
"9096540","9099300"," I think that no matter what apple earnings are. "
"9099680","9101860"," And Amazon earnings are whether good or bad."
"9102060","9104540"," I think you're going to see a take the money money and exit the market moment."
"9105300","9108380"," And I think that Dixie is kind of showing that right now. "
"9108380","9114960"," Dixie to me is kind of showing like a Dixie is kind of showing like the yeah we're going to"
"9114960","9117500"," go up go up we're going to confirm and then go up."
"9119540","9123840"," So you guys have to scale out a little bit even if you're bearish."
"9124120","9125600"," It's like take a breather. "
"9126000","9129740"," These things take weeks not one day."
"9132420","9134360"," Like contrary to popular belief."
"9136080","9137380"," It's not just straight up. "
"9137680","9138740"," It's not just straight down."
"9140820","9142940"," It's not going to be it's going to be a process."
"9152350","9153110"," It's not BS. "
"9153430","9156610"," They're not going to allow these puts the clothes and the money you're out of your fucking skull."
"9157190","9159730"," It's a one in ten chance to let these puts expire and the money."
"9160810","9162570"," You got a ten percent chance of us. "
"9162650","9166070"," You've got a ten percent chance of us closing this and the money down here."
"9167950","9171670"," You've got earnings coming out tomorrow like the biggest ones in the stock market."
"9172330","9175330"," Sometimes sometimes you'll see that. "
"9179030","9184690"," Sometimes it'll happen sometimes sometimes you'll see the overall market start crashing before you"
"9184690","9187630"," get into Amazon and apple earnings but."
"9189330","9192490"," Structural market structural problems."
"9192690","9195070"," Yeah, you can see it. "
"9195330","9199750"," But I don't see those structural problems today."
"9204120","9205600"," I'm going to get the music up."
"9205920","9207100"," I should have played bare music today. "
"9207540","9208480"," I didn't even think about it."
"9208540","9209940"," I should have fucking jammed on it for you guys."
"9210080","9210400"," I apologize. "
"9217310","9218370"," No, I don't own apple."
"9218950","9221770"," I do not have apple in my account."
"9224790","9228830"," Matter of fact like Starbucks is I shouldn't have bought Starbucks. "
"9229850","9231330"," I'm fucking you know what I'm angry."
"9231510","9233310"," Dude, I was angry yesterday about Starbucks."
"9233850","9234850"," I was pretty fucking pissed. "
"9236510","9240730"," It's one of the largest under performers in my portfolio."
"9242110","9246290"," Dude, it's performing worse than fucking Tyson."
"9248950","9252810"," I'm looking at shit that I'm like oh and I got something else cool to tell you guys about. "
"9253890","9255710"," I want to talk to you about Schwab."
"9257610","9263950"," I've been tracking Schwab in the background and how it's trading against the market."
"9265990","9271250"," And I find it fascinating right now to be watching Schwab as a market indicator. "
"9274050","9275950"," Maybe we'll go over that tomorrow, write that down."
"9277030","9282490"," I'll go over Schwab tomorrow because I own Schwab too."
"9283030","9288350"," And I'm fascinated by like I didn't buy apple because I was like I didn't buy apple because I'm"
"9288350","9290770"," like yeah that shit's going to be sideways and up. "
"9291550","9294870"," And like take forever to get there and it's not going to outperform the market."
"9297010","9302130"," So I was like I was like I'm not going to buy apple so I don't know any fucking apple."
"9304370","9307250"," Like PayPal had that nice huge fucking bloodbath. "
"9308050","9311830"," So I'm like yeah I'll buy some of that shit that shit has a chance to come up make some"
"9311830","9312090"," money."
"9312910","9315090"," Tyson Foods Budweiser Verizon."
"9317470","9322670"," All that shit ATT along with a bunch of spec growth stuff. "
"9325320","9330920"," So but apple I never added I used to trade apple all the time and I never bought it."
"9331320","9337200"," I always felt like when I was trading apple in Amazon I felt like I focused on it completely."
"9337620","9342680"," Like when I was an apple trader it's all I traded all day long every day was just apple. "
"9343040","9351600"," I paid attention to the indexes to know where I was at with apple but it was like a really"
"9351600","9352540"," secondary thing."
"9353300","9354820"," I focused on apple."
"9355040","9356120"," Amazon was the same way. "
"9357260","9359720"," Nice swing trade in both of those tickers."
"9363990","9367390"," Spy come back down to recheck its previous low down here."
"9367810","9371070"," We'll try to make this more, try to get this more exacting here. "
"9371930","9372950"," That's the previous low."
"9373930","9377430"," I had the PT a little bit higher but we'll keep this one right here."
"9379130","9384310"," So like yeah apple I never added no blood no skin in the game on apple. "
"9384310","9394610"," I should and I don't swing trades."
"9396430","9398190"," So right now where we are."
"9399130","9400770"," Matter of fact I'm going to take a look at something else. "
"9400990","9406010"," So right now where we are for a swing trade because we're testing the daily trigger."
"9406970","9414850"," You'd be looking for us to tag the daily trigger first then you'd be looking for us to regain the"
"9414850","9415530"," hourly trigger."
"9415530","9420490"," And then you would place a trade that's about one month out. "
"9421290","9429490"," Now if you wanted to take more on more risk and not wait for the regaining of the hourly trigger."
"9431030","9434250"," And you're like I'm going to I'm going to want to get more more crazy here."
"9434350","9438290"," Then you have to be concerned about us actually going down to the weekly trigger. "
"9438690","9444830"," If that's the case you probably need to put a three month trade on that could compensate."
"9445530","9453630"," And likely a spread more in the money that would cop that would compensate for a reversal down to"
"9453630","9454250"," the weekly trigger."
"9454490","9460110"," So currently right now I don't see a swing trade today. "
"9460930","9462170"," That's like safe."
"9463770","9464430"," Personally."
"9465770","9469470"," I don't see that trade as being viable right where we are today. "
"9469470","9476270"," I think that you need to see the tag of the daily trigger or the regaining of the hourly trigger."
"9476990","9481850"," And then then for me I think the riskier trade is better the one month call is a caller or"
"9481850","9482730"," call spread is fine."
"9487980","9491980"," You have a conspiracy theory that they monitor me when I'm covering a apple. "
"9492940","9494180"," I think they monitor me right now."
"9494460","9495740"," So we've had that discussion too."
"9497960","9502420"," That they monitor what my what my takes are the market. "
"9502420","9505260"," So I'm fairly confident that they're doing that."
"9511240","9512060"," Fairly confident."
"9517680","9519000"," Just check that right there. "
"9519060","9520820"," Look for any liquidity to the downside."
"9521940","9523460"," There it is down there."
"9524020","9524940"," Way down there. "
"9525520","9526360"," Let's look at it."
"9527860","9528860"," Still sitting there."
"9528940","9530120"," It's been sitting there for a couple weeks. "
"9530280","9530780"," Been watching that."
"9530920","9532120"," That's at 440 down there."
"9534390","9535930"," Boy, a bull wants to buy that. "
"9536110","9537270"," So bad, doesn't he?"
"9547720","9549100"," Nice liquidity block right here too."
"9551120","9554440"," I'm looking at August 3rd calls."
"9555300","9559420"," Right now I'm looking at 4.53s. They're 62 cents right now. "
"9560120","9561520"," I think that's still pricey."
"9562200","9565860"," They're a 26 delta calls."
"9568000","9572140"," 4.53s for tomorrow. "
"9573120","9578340"," I want to trade Thursday's tech run."
"9578940","9580360"," Or that I expect there to be."
"9580560","9582500"," I'm expecting there to be a tech run on tomorrow. "
"9582540","9587000"," But I don't want to pay 62 cents for a 23.26 delta call."
"9587320","9588860"," So I'm kind of pissy about the price."
"9589600","9594100"," I want to pay 20 to 30 cents, believe it or not. "
"9594560","9597080"," That's what I want to pay for a zero day for tomorrow."
"9598460","9604160"," And so 62 cents to me makes me think like, yeah, buy 62 cents."
"9604740","9606480"," I'm going to slam it down to 40 or 20. "
"9606480","9611040"," You're going to have to buy another 10 pack, another 25 pack, another 50 pack."
"9612560","9615380"," And you'll DCA in around 30 cents."
"9619110","9621750"," And you might get 50 or 60 out of the trade. "
"9623430","9627750"," So I'm still flat right now and still don't see any zero dates."
"9627950","9629990"," Still don't see any one dates."
"9630350","9632090"," Don't see any Friday calls yet that are. "
"9634110","9635010"," To my liking."
"9635010","9647900"," Yeah, I"
"9647900","9649340"," want to buy TLT too."
"9649680","9650520"," I'm I'm down with. "
"9650800","9653480"," I'm looking for a dip buy in TLT."
"9654060","9655600"," I'm down with that trade."
"9656360","9659920"," So if we can see like if I can see some volume coming at TLT. "
"9661320","9663500"," I'm interested in taking along on it."
"9664020","9665120"," It's getting there, right?"
"9665260","9666660"," It's like it's making me like."
"9667660","9669000"," It's making me excited. "
"9669680","9670820"," So probably covering."
"9671120","9675020"," Well, actually probably cover TLT and we'll cover."
"9675900","9677520"," Three times a bull. "
"9678780","9680160"," ETFs is like three good ones."
"9692100","9695720"," All set at office buildings evacuated and DC reason unknown at the moments."
"9696340","9698660"," You know that company that. "
"9700280","9702560"," That company that I was talking to you about earlier."
"9704040","9705960"," They remember we had the fake."
"9706040","9708760"," Do you remember the fake explosion of the Pentagon. "
"9709520","9713500"," Day where we went down a bunch of points by like 10 30 in the morning or something."
"9714500","9717300"," That same company looked at."
"9718400","9720960"," Whether it mattered that that news came out or not. "
"9721640","9723140"," And tried to assign."
"9724600","9727240"," The probability of it happening on that day at that time."
"9727680","9730140"," And maybe somebody bringing it up and it gaining traction. "
"9730800","9732580"," They did it a whole investigation into that."
"9732780","9735260"," I'm going to send you guys a link tonight in discord."
"9735880","9736800"," Some cool shit to read. "
"9746670","9751850"," Yeah, so if we go down and test the weekly, I'll buy some call spreads."
"9752530","9756310"," If we regain the hourly, I'll buy some call spreads with you."
"9757110","9757450"," Definitely. "
"9761060","9763360"," Margaret needs to murder the by the F&DIP crowd."
"9763980","9766720"," No, this is the there's no real there is no crowd."
"9767800","9768840"," You're you're in it. "
"9768960","9769580"," You're wrong on that."
"9770560","9772520"," Your opinion on that is false."
"9774740","9778120"," Presently hope overnight cascade, especially around rebalance, whatever is happening. "
"9778280","9778700"," It had it overnight."
"9778960","9779780"," So they drill more things."
"9780120","9781680"," I agree with that PCE. "
"9782600","9783240"," In monetary."
"9792000","9793120"," You did just like him."
"9793180","9796800"," Yeah, I'm looking for I'm looking for him to be about 30 cents. "
"9798420","9800100"," 20 to 30 cents somewhere in there."
"9800940","9803360"," I want to see him get get burned into the clothes."
"9804260","9806380"," I think they might get burned after the bell. "
"9806380","9809360"," So if they can get burned down to like 20 or something like that."
"9811180","9812600"," Or if the four fifty twos."
"9813520","9819020"," If the four fifty twos could get torched down to like 40 cents, I'd be happy to. "
"9825520","9827600"," Yeah, still know still no low on the day."
"9830310","9832830"," Would you love retest 93?"
"9834030","9834770"," Yeah, TLT."
"9836370","9840750"," Oh, is it a super moon?"
"9841390","9841930"," I didn't know that. "
"9842590","9844010"," Is it really a super moon BC?"
"9844010","9847250"," I actually do follow that sometimes."

"10281330","10285630"," real licensing and then boom, they go win and take all your monetization again. "

"10641110","10647720"," Is very religious and they have like a prayer group of some kind."
"10649520","10655970"," Like a prayer group knows this phone number and. "
"10657410","10659070"," After having it for like a week."
"10660350","10669080"," I was included in a group chat with like 30 people and they start this."
"10670740","10673800"," Like group chat up of saying prayers and stuff. "

"10827170","10833660"," What I did was what I did was I was like here's the deal ladies. "
"10834660","10839440"," I was like I'm gonna start posting porn in this in this circle."
"10839780","10841020"," If you don't remove me."
"10841760","10843300"," And they're like he ain't gonna do that. "
"10843560","10844280"," Don't worry about him."
"10845140","10846220"," That's just Mary."
"10846840","10847660"," That's not that guy. "
"10850020","10852000"," I don't know why she's acting like that right now."
"10852000","10853360"," I'm supposed to be having an episode or something."
"10853360","10854700"," I'm like I'm not having an episode. "

"10861260","10862460"," I checked you not."
"10862900","10866260"," And then they thought they were like that's definitely Mary. "
"10866540","10868340"," They're just like maybe somebody's got Mary's phone."
"10868500","10870620"," Maybe it's Mary's son or something like that."
"10870740","10872200"," I'm like I'm telling you right now ladies. "
"10873700","10875840"," You don't get me out of this fucking string."

"10879800","10882620"," In this chat thing I'm gonna start posting porn."
"10884080","10886520"," Now they didn't know what kind of porn I was gonna start posting."
"10887280","10891540"," So they told me to basically go fuck myself. "
"10892140","10893980"," And they're gonna keep me in the chat circle."
"10895940","10897700"," I started posting porn."

"10910960","10913260"," And it went away for like two months."
"10914380","10915400"," Maybe till today. "
"10915720","10916840"," Later yesterday."

"10952090","10954670"," I only received this phone number in the last couple months."
"10955090","10959450"," I wish my provider never gave it to me as she seems like a popular person."
