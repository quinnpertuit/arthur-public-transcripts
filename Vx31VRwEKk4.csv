"18820","19480"," Check the hole."
"21480","22840"," Check the hole."
"26760","29060"," How is the hole doing this morning?"
"29580","30640"," Probably not too good, is it?"
"33730","39900"," I'm going to assume that uh, hold on here. "
"42940","44300"," Turn this bad boy off."
"44540","44780"," Let's go."
"47660","48620"," Yee-haw, baby. "
"52980","54520"," Rock and roll."
"54520","54740"," Oh."
"56960","58440"," Let's start by this. "
"62980","63599"," Scrabber's over."
"65000","65760"," Anger isn't."
"67920","68400"," Saved. "
"73900","74560"," Oh, yeah."
"75840","77320"," Make sure you're reading this right here, boys"
"81900","92820"," and"
"92820","92820"," girls."
"103720","110140"," I'm so short right now. "
"114180","115040"," You don't know how short I am."
"115040","115260"," You don't know how short I am."
"115260","115740"," You don't know how short. "
"116100","117160"," Matter of fact, I'm so short."
"118280","119940"," My broker called me this morning."
"122400","127360"," They told me that they would, they would, they would actually give me more margin. "
"128759","132400"," And then I could charge them to give me more margin."
"134420","135020"," Guaranteed."
"137500","138600"," Oh, baby. "
"138920","139860"," Here goes the pain."
"142420","145100"," How's that pain trade doing this morning?"
"147420","148440"," Anybody out there?"
"150200","151180"," Who's out there?"
"152780","155020"," How's that pain trade doing this morning?"
"156220","157100"," You feel it now?"
"159880","161400"," Feeling that pain trade?"
"167940","173240"," Looking at my numbers yesterday, I'm like, man, thousands of people watching this show yesterday."
"175500","177540"," Some of y'all were here yesterday. "
"179960","181240"," Good morning to you."
"181640","182740"," To just say good morning."
"182900","184420"," Someone special out there just thinking more. "
"184480","185100"," Don Mafia."
"185980","187200"," Good morning, everybody."
"187860","189240"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"189320","189920"," Y'all doing well?"
"190640","192680"," I'm starting to look at your comments right now. "
"193260","194680"," Good morning to you all."
"197720","198680"," Good morning."
"198720","201300"," Good morning to all of you. "
"204060","205100"," Everybody's doing well."
"205100","207460"," So, we had a blog to talk about this morning."
"209920","211960"," Get a bull cross right here. "
"212900","214960"," Just so you can see, there's a bull cross right here."
"217720","219480"," Forming up nicely here in the background."
"221400","224760"," I could end up getting a little bit of a pullback here at some point. "
"225040","228500"," We'll just start you off real quick so everybody's all good and ready to go."
"230040","232200"," We talked about buying the clothes yesterday."
"232200","238620"," We talked about buying the open this morning yesterday before the bell talked about the last of the"
"238620","239580"," volatility for the week. "
"241520","243380"," Last of the volatility for the week."
"244880","246920"," Was just this morning."
"248840","251040"," Yesterday was an odd day. "
"251260","257360"," So, if you're watching right now, you're probably one of those people that tune in."
"258680","261820"," Most of the day and not just the part you want to."
"262040","264180"," This adds up becoming some resistance right here. "
"264720","267020"," That's why you know there is some resistance right where we are."
"267760","270460"," This is the daily trigger that we're coming into right now."
"270680","271200"," Right here. "
"271380","273520"," So, take some profit right here."
"274120","276040"," If you are long, take some profit right here."
"276120","277420"," I want you to see that the daily. "
"278500","279240"," Hold on here."
"279920","281260"," This is the daily trigger right here."
"282180","282940"," It's kind of cool. "
"283080","284240"," We're going to start to use these things."
"285440","287180"," We've got the weekly trigger."
"289120","290140"," Right here. "
"293410","297690"," Start using these things more frequently in stream as we start to make some progress here."
"299050","299630"," The."
"303190","304110"," 395 60. "
"306190","306770"," Whoa."
"311080","312700"," 395 60 right here."
"312860","314360"," This is the hourly trigger right here. "
"317450","325950"," I'm going to grab this monthly trigger right here."
"334720","336100"," So, we're going to do a little bit of a."
"336760","339080"," We're going to do a little bit of a we're going to look at."
"341800","342860"," We're going to look at. "
"344620","346800"," We're going to do a little after action report for yesterday."
"348300","351720"," It's an important thing to do because I'm busy days like yesterday."
"352040","353560"," So yesterday we had a busy day, right?"
"353720","354300"," It's a bad day. "
"355500","358020"," I was looking at the numbers on Twitch, YouTube."
"359080","361060"," On a restream that I signed up for."
"361260","363160"," And we had some serious numbers yesterday. "
"364760","366140"," Of people tuning in."
"366240","370720"," And we had more commenters in the chat yesterday."
"372060","374540"," And so it was kind of ironic and iconic. "
"375120","375480"," Iconic."
"375580","375860"," Well, then iconic."
"376180","378580"," Ironic to just see some of the commenting yesterday in stream. "
"379620","381040"," So coming to this daily trigger right here."
"381300","385480"," This is kind of a this is the place you need to know about this daily because for two reasons."
"385480","388880"," Well, number one, the hourly trigger were above right here. "
"389180","396860"," And number two, market sellers do not want to see price get above the daily trigger."
"397380","399600"," If price gets above the daily trigger here."
"400540","404260"," And if the if the hourly trigger follows the upside here. "
"405600","408200"," They can become very explosive to the upside."
"409660","410640"," Major squeezing."
"411880","414460"," So you're going to see sellers want to step in here. "
"415940","417660"," Right off of this daily trigger."
"417860","419240"," And you can actually see it happening right now."
"422170","425830"," And you don't want to see price get underneath this daily trigger over here. "
"426250","427630"," For this hourly trigger, excuse me."
"430550","433690"," Like this is where this is like the last stand of bears right here."
"433850","435770"," These sellers from yesterday are sitting right here. "
"435930","436930"," This is where they are."
"437370","438730"," Now, if they become overrun."
"438730","445490"," Here and you start to see going to pay attention to this yellow line and this white line and this"
"445490","446090"," red line. "
"446790","448630"," Because as this day unfolds."
"451240","453780"," If we get a successful retest."
"455260","457020"," This is a five minute chart right here. "
"458620","462740"," If we get any kind of a successful retest as we crank up here."
"463200","467480"," We're going to see some major squeezing like bam, something like this, bam, something like this."
"467480","471120"," Anything like this price continues higher. "
"471260","473560"," It'll start squeezing in a big way."
"475320","479760"," Pretty big like it's going to be explosive here in the upside move."
"481660","484080"," Now, there's some other H lines here. "
"484160","485360"," We just got rid of one H line."
"485620","487300"," I'll do another H line above here."
"487640","492300"," There's a failure to close right here. "
"493320","494020"," Somewhere in here."
"497620","499220"," Make that a yellow one right there."
"499320","500860"," You guys all know what H lines are. "
"504320","505460"," There's another one higher."
"505700","507120"," There's one more H line above here."
"507160","508340"," There's another one down here. "
"508560","512919"," And the markets markets expected to make a big move, right?"
"515860","518000"," Now, this big move that's expected out there."
"518780","523059"," I want you to when you're out there trying to find out where we are in the market."
"523059","524780"," I want you to take a moment to breathe. "
"524780","526640"," We're going to review all of yesterday."
"527340","527500"," So."
"529500","530560"," Hang tight for a second. "
"541430","545710"," What I want you to realize is that everybody's been trained."
"548030","549170"," We're in a bear market."
"550110","554110"," And, you know, die, die, die and crash, crash, crash. "
"555270","558910"," And we were in that train that mode that mode last year in 2022."
"560210","563470"," Now, this year we saw the market get bought in January."
"563730","564290"," Excuse me here. "
"564530","567810"," People deploying money, not a lot of money, but, you know, but some money deployed."
"571710","576110"," And if we have some kind of stabilization of markets, some semblance of stabilization of markets,"
"576650","581770"," you're going to expect in the springtime to have a bottom."
"582830","583750"," That's viable. "
"585190","590430"," And it'll be traded up into summer when people with money go on vacation."
"590430","593530"," And then you'll get your dog days of summer."
"594530","597390"," This is when a market becomes stabilized at least. "
"599670","603650"," So when you're looking at, hey, man, we're going to crash and burn this market again."
"603890","604250"," Woohoo."
"605690","607670"," I'm not seeing that right now at this moment. "
"607830","608350"," I was seeing that."
"608410","614090"," I was seeing that into this fed meeting possibility of like crash and bear and burn and."
"614530","616010"," All this volatility. "
"616690","620890"," I'm not seeing it anymore at this moment, especially after what was really said yesterday."
"621530","627870"," And I made a point yesterday to want to talk to you about what Jerome actually said and not what"
"627870","631830"," would be pushed on social media and in the news media to you."
"632370","634170"," And they ran that story yesterday. "
"634950","636190"," That shit was pre-written."
"637950","642650"," They were looking for any kind of an in yesterday to the end of rate increases."
"644090","648390"," The dot plot saying this, but we know you should know at this point. "
"649670","651870"," Is there really rate increases or rate."
"653310","658650"," Or a rate pause coming down the road and you know that's not true."
"658650","659290"," It's impossible. "
"660630","661810"," It's not going to happen."
"661910","662310"," I apologize."
"662410","665070"," Well, we can we'll discuss if that's possible or not possible. "
"667070","669910"," What does it lead to that kind of stuff if it does happen."
"670830","672990"," But the most likely case here."
"674510","677550"," Is that your next 25 BPS. "
"678110","679390"," Is going to be."
"680910","685790"," As they they they they backstop commercial real estate."
"687690","691190"," The next tumble will probably be that commercial real estate. "
"691510","693890"," And it'll likely be be backstop."
"694190","695490"," You might not believe this."
"695490","698450"," But if you go and you find yourself someone from the bond market. "
"698930","700570"," Especially in commercial backed securities."
"701230","702270"," They're going to tell you."
"702630","704130"," I guarantee you go find someone. "
"704310","705810"," I don't know."
"705870","708250"," Some of these guys I know but some of these guys I forget who their names are."
"709470","710590"," There's a guy from Canada. "
"713270","714930"," That trades commercial backed securities."
"716150","717870"," And he said last year he was like."
"718630","720530"," It's like there's no fucking way they're not going to. "
"720910","723550"," He's like even when they remove liquidity from the system."
"723550","726410"," They're not going to do it from commercial backed securities."
"728070","729290"," And they didn't. "
"729670","731510"," And they still aren't right now."
"732290","735330"," And when that happens they're going to tell you the same thing."
"735630","737970"," And I told you early yesterday that they're going to make you work. "
"738990","740610"," To pay for this recession."
"741390","742270"," The front running."
"742950","745890"," They're like reversing our previous crashes. "
"746710","749190"," Right now in how they protect themselves."
"750250","751590"," They know it's coming."
"752050","754210"," So they're going to golden parachute themselves. "
"754610","756230"," And you're going to fucking pay for it."
"756910","759290"," And we saw that in the unemployment unemployment."
"759830","762090"," We saw that in the client claims numbers this morning. "
"765000","765960"," You're going to get a job."
"766080","768320"," You're going to get a second job and you're going to get a job and you're going to get a"
"768320","769740"," second job and you're going to pay for us."
"770260","771740"," We're squeezing right now. "
"773520","776220"," And as we get above that daily trigger right here."
"776220","778920"," We're now trading three ninety six ninety two."
"779400","780060"," Trying to close. "
"780880","783080"," Close the crime."
"783580","785400"," What's not really a crime that took place yesterday."
"787180","788480"," It's not really a crime. "
"788640","789460"," We actually just filled."
"791120","792540"," The implied move yesterday."
"792960","795720"," So if you were paying attention and you were here in the morning yesterday. "
"796280","799240"," If you're a regular viewer and not this other crowd of people."
"799800","801540"," That just showed up for fed day."
"802900","804220"," You already knew. "
"804220","806280"," And we talked about in the morning."
"806700","808420"," Hey set yourself up."
"809040","810640"," A strangle on the market. "
"811320","812580"," We will likely fail."
"813680","815140"," To hit the upper implied move."
"815560","818140"," And we'll likely hit the lower implied move today. "
"818740","821620"," And if you can manage that trade and the stress of that trade."
"822500","824160"," You can maximize your gains."
"825820","826820"," In the market. "
"827480","831360"," So if you go up we go up or if we go down doesn't matter we're likely going to close"
"831360","833340"," both or at least get close to both."
"833340","838520"," So yesterday if you had done that trade from the morning."
"839260","841340"," You would have printed the high and printed the low. "
"842540","844140"," Now you watched yesterday."
"846080","851300"," We had some great trades right we've had some great call calls slammed up three times."
"851880","852680"," Ruled over. "
"853440","856060"," Went back down to slam into the implied move yesterday."
"856800","860240"," And that's a moving target right we already know the implied move for the day."
"860240","863020"," Can be impacted by zero dates in the market. "
"863360","866920"," It's not exact right but it's close close enough in her shoes and anger dates."
"868680","871460"," But the key here was that as we close that day yesterday."
"872160","873580"," This chat that I have. "
"874180","875000"," Went insane."
"875780","877800"," I'm talking like just ripping comments."
"878480","881100"," And it got overrun by bad alpha. "
"881920","886820"," With people saying I'm so fucking short I'm this I'm long puts into this bell."
"886820","889580"," The market's going to crash most bearish thing ever."
"890100","892440"," And I'm this and I'm that and I'm this and I'm that. "
"892760","897360"," Meanwhile you don't know if they're trading 500 bucks or half a million dollars."
"899720","902080"," You don't know if they're being real or not real."
"903080","906580"," And there was a lot of money we made as my point yesterday in every move. "
"907280","908540"," There was a ton of money we made."
"908740","911040"," You don't know if they were just upside down and need to recover."
"911600","914040"," You don't know what their entries were their exits were. "
"914040","916420"," And the crazy part is this morning on Twitter."
"917000","920720"," Everyone supposedly closed yesterday but not in that chat yesterday."
"921060","922400"," Nobody fucking closed. "
"923300","925680"," When it kind of like took a life of its own into the bell."
"926080","930980"," When the trade yesterday was to take either the strangle or the upside on the downside."
"932220","933760"," And close your shit at that bell. "
"934540","936180"," Take your risk off the table."
"937000","939360"," Collect your money and wait for this morning."
"940220","944140"," Wait for those numbers to come out and position yourself up or down. "
"945140","947020"," For this market to shake itself out."
"947180","950220"," I also talked to yesterday about dealers."
"951740","955860"," After an event will sometimes just be like thank you for playing. "
"956300","957700"," You played the game."
"959300","962780"," We reset the market for you to trade this this event."
"963100","966020"," And now it's over and now balls coming off the market. "
"966020","970760"," We fucking had our involved this morning for our potential of all event."
"970940","973760"," The market was hedged into it and we didn't get it."
"974880","977520"," So now you're seeing the ball come off the market. "
"979000","981060"," Right now at this moment that's what you're seeing."
"983040","985660"," You get Nvidia tagged it yesterday."
"986380","987840"," Apple tagged it yesterday. "
"989100","992140"," And the immediate thought is when we fucking tagged it it's going to go down."
"992340","995780"," Well there's likely going to be some kind of a retag or at least retest them at high."
"996360","997380"," And then even for the downside. "
"999020","1000140"," How low is that?"
"1001400","1004260"," You're talking about a couple of the strongest months of the fucking year."
"1005360","1010140"," And yet you're calling for I'm calling for your calling for rather people are saying well no it's"
"1010140","1013880"," going to be a fucking bloodbath or going to 380 minimum if not 370 or something like that."
"1014800","1018740"," And after that after that press yesterday I was bearish and I was not bearish. "
"1018820","1019180"," I was scared."
"1020180","1026359"," I think my comment on Twitter a week ago was I'm hedged to the tits for FMC."
"1027440","1029079"," I'm going to trade it up into it. "
"1031200","1034760"," I'm going to trade the market up into FMC and be hedged into it."
"1035240","1036480"," Now that FMC is over."
"1037220","1041180"," I didn't see what a lot of people saw in that FMC yesterday. "
"1042220","1046359"," What I saw yesterday was I might take away from that FMC yesterday was."
"1047260","1051380"," We're going to keep raising rates we're going to back wherever the fuck needs to be backed up and"
"1051380","1052540"," you're going to work your asses off."
"1055040","1061340"," In the most bizarre part of it is you've got people saying this is this is the last rate increase"
"1061340","1065500"," of 2023 and we won't get we have one more possibly. "
"1066840","1067800"," And that's it."
"1068720","1070380"," I'm like okay let's say it's the case."
"1071860","1076660"," With all this back stopping that's going on and you're going to see a spike in inflation. "
"1077260","1078280"," There's no way around it."
"1078860","1080700"," And the market will price that in."
"1081140","1082420"," That's not to the downside. "
"1084060","1090300"," When inflation goes up the fucking stock market goes up and when they stop fighting inflation the"
"1090300","1091640"," stock market goes up."
"1092300","1097420"," The stock market gets repriced on the downside when inflation comes down."
"1097420","1103400"," And furthermore all of our targets I believe your targets out there are like hey yeah we'll"
"1103400","1111480"," probably you know we'll probably fix this shit by 2023 maybe 2024 worst case scenario late 2024. "
"1112740","1117320"," And what I took away from that talk yesterday was oh fuck no we're just going to we're going to"
"1117320","1123140"," roll this out even farther now and you're going to get fucked along the way."
"1124700","1126120"," We're going to extend this."
"1129600","1134480"," If there's an extension of it and they're going to backstop and they're going to make you pay for"
"1134480","1134660"," it. "
"1135560","1136880"," It could be a brutal."
"1138460","1144900"," Like three four five years now there was a caveat to this that I left you with yesterday was it's"
"1144900","1146580"," kicking the can down the road."
"1148340","1152940"," And and the key here is it probably won't last five years. "
"1152940","1156140"," It'll probably last into an election cycle."
"1157280","1163680"," And you'll see people run on this and propose to you out there two outcomes."
"1164500","1166260"," You'll likely hold on a second here. "
"1168690","1170810"," You'll likely propose to you."
"1172170","1177250"," We stay the course like a Volcker thing right we're going to we're going to be like the 1950s and"
"1177250","1178490"," 60s and 70s."
"1178930","1182510"," We'll do maximum unemployment we'll fight this for the next decade or so. "
"1182510","1188030"," It's kind of like austerity like you're going to have like you're going to bite your other upper"
"1188030","1191350"," lip and we're going to protect you from people that want to."
"1192150","1196630"," I don't know get rich quick and stuff like that and you're going to agree to that contract which I"
"1196630","1196950"," doubt."
"1197570","1202510"," I don't think that the I think the United States has has become a greedy fucking society. "
"1205090","1206490"," Like absurd greed."
"1209190","1212850"," On steroids and you're probably going to get someone else that runs."
"1213950","1215950"," In the election they will say to you. "
"1217270","1221570"," We're going to make we're going to make you we're going to we're going to keep you employed we're"
"1221570","1225590"," going to pay you better and you're going to be able to buy a house and you're going to be"
"1225590","1228630"," able to buy eggs or twenty bucks or ten bucks or fuck they are."
"1230550","1235270"," And that's basically a hey you're going to accept inflation and we're going to pump this shit"
"1235270","1235570"," again."
"1239320","1243580"," So you'll be left with that you'll be left with that in this next election cycle. "
"1244460","1247180"," That decision we made and that's basically kicking the can down the road."
"1248400","1253660"," All these people will be out of here at that point and you're either going to be voting for more"
"1253660","1256940"," MMT or some kind of."
"1258960","1263300"," You know like I don't know like it's not golden age a renaissance. "
"1264720","1268260"," Of responsibility for you as an American I doubt that side happens."
"1269180","1273840"," I think it's fine time and kicking the can down the road and not having to deal with the shit"
"1273840","1276420"," show that's coming in the meantime you're going to pay for it."
"1277260","1278500"," I am shocked right now. "
"1279320","1284380"," And I got to admit to you I am shocked right now that this is happening and taking place."
"1284400","1285740"," We've got another age line down below."
"1285840","1290280"," We've got some gaps left below at three ninety three sixteen thirteen or so three ninety nine three"
"1290280","1291020"," fifty down here. "
"1296290","1299730"," So I guess the first thing we'll leave you with is an after action report on yesterday."
"1300270","1301210"," Kind of did that here."
"1301810","1303410"," The second thing would be. "
"1305330","1309410"," Be careful what you read in the chat on busy days from people."
"1309810","1314870"," I probably need to get some moderators to add to the stream."
"1316050","1317350"," Specifically for those days. "
"1317850","1321750"," Just start mute muting people three day banning people that kind of stuff."
"1322130","1324750"," Quiet people down even if they're regulars just quiet them down for."
"1325550","1326810"," The day or so right. "
"1327450","1330550"," We love you but we're going to quiet you for one day or three days or something."
"1332150","1333290"," Because in those moments."
"1334750","1337950"," We tend to get I was thinking that maybe I could get a bot. "
"1340190","1343930"," Maybe put a bot where my cursor is down here like a just a bot down here."
"1344750","1345270"," And."
"1346450","1351670"," The the busier the chat gets the more anti or the more counter alpha. "
"1351970","1354450"," The the the the alpha gets more counter."
"1354810","1356290"," The busier it gets typically."
"1358970","1362870"," You'll you'll see it like you'll see the alpha actually become worse. "
"1364470","1370130"," As the chat becomes more active independently not me asking you a question but."
"1371310","1372150"," Like just."
"1374510","1376990"," Just when that just in the chat is like a user. "
"1378290","1379530"," Generated in emotion."
"1380410","1381270"," Call like that."
"1381590","1384470"," The more emotional you see in the more emotion you see in the chat. "
"1384630","1385790"," It'll call like an emotion meter."
"1386710","1390990"," More emotional people get the more counter alpha it becomes."
"1396350","1397110"," Well here. "
"1401820","1403320"," Now for Friday."
"1403820","1407440"," Well today we've got new home sales at 10 a.m. That already happened Friday."

"5222670","5232710"," market and if we're gonna actually attack this higher or if it's gonna be lower JPM"
"5232710","5239890"," caller comes out it's like here and way down here that we know the move is probably lower I think"
"5239890","5246670"," we have to respect that into end of month so it's probably gonna be some if I had to guess"
"5246670","5256170"," there's probably gonna be some range trading in here into the 31st so 3920 uh four hundred and four"
"5256170","5262250"," six and what's the what's the caller at four zero six zero right up in here this is SPX so"
"5262250","5268570"," right in here so I'm gonna expect this range by trading it in the month we'll look at this on"
"5268570","5274030"," a regular chart but for the next few days let's say in the end of month it's into March 31st"
"5274030","5282850"," this is what I'm gonna expect four zero six zero right here"
"5282850","5292120"," I'm gonna expect sellers to say at least at least expectation"
"5292120","5300640"," doesn't have to happen just what I'm expecting I'm gonna expect sell side right here and I expect"
"5300640","5305400"," buyers to step in down below as I said to you yesterday"
"5305400","5315710"," I'm gonna"
"5315710","5326660"," expect buyers to step in demand to step in right in here and I"
"5326660","5336460"," expect us to be 31st today is the 23rd a lot of time left in here I'm gonna make expectation"
"5336460","5341940"," now if it breaks like my expectation breaks if I'm proven wrong that's fine I don't have to be"
"5341940","5347980"," right this dream is sponsored by to the tick my expectation here is the banachi and market profile"
"5347980","5354080"," levels by so there's no like hey Captain has to be right or wrong but there is this right here"
"5354080","5362560"," and my expectation is that this shit's gonna get pinned below four zero six zero we're probably"
"5362560","5367560"," gonna be range bound in here some kind of like yeah yeah let's wait until the end of the month"
"5368680","5373940"," even if we trade below for a minute or above for a minute clear out that gap maybe above I'm"
"5373940","5378040"," gonna expect us to be range bound in the 31st and then you're gonna be seeing a bunch of people"
"5378040","5383960"," on on fin to it saying well what's the GPM caller what's everybody following and you're gonna get"
"5383960","5389280"," three strikes and you're gonna find out what they need to print or to buy the other side of the"
"5389280","5395840"," trade it's called a bear seagull normally but you'll tend to go up and pay for the short side to"
"5395840","5403380"," making a free trade to hedge the market and reduces volatility to the up and downside offers"
"5403380","5410080"," protection and it also has a magnet to lower lows any kind of push-up higher here into into the"
"5410080","5417140"," end of the month will be met with a magnet lower believe it or not so anytime buyers stop buying"
"5417140","5422980"," we should roll over and down roll over and down roll over and down into the 31st I'm talking to"
"5422980","5428740"," you about the JPM caller right now my expectations are into and of quarter four zero six zero is"
"5428740","5434880"," probably the top if we do squeeze above it at any point and into 31st we will still have a"
"5434880","5439800"," magnet to come lower than it and we do have this little bit of shit up here to close above"
"5439800","5447320"," four zero eight zero four zero or four ten still the table but you know once this ends I'm gonna"
"5447320","5454860"," I'm gonna expect people to be watching to see what the upper target is I'm gonna watch it I'm sure"
"5454860","5461200"," that people are gonna be like hey we're getting a caller that's four three zero zero is it four two"
"5461200","5469500"," zero zero on that JPM caller is the downside of the JPM caller 3700 and now 3350 or something"
"5469500","5477840"," I'm gonna expect that into summertime that JPM caller I'm gonna bet it's like fourth probably four"
"5477840","5487260"," 34 20 then maybe like then the downside risk would be probably 30"
"5487260","5495340"," 3300 3700 on that caller so we'll see how that plays itself out and it's gonna be a perfect thing"
"5495340","5504320"," right you kind of like kind of like easy street right you trade it up kind of pendant here trade"
"5504320","5509020"," it up even if it's down for a little bit trade it up sometimes after the caller you'll see a"
"5509020","5513340"," dip to I want to be aware of that too if the if the if the caller is up here"
"5513340","5519040"," you'll sometimes see after the month we'll go we'll break lower for a brief moment and then it"
"5519040","5524960"," heads up there and tags the upper target and then we'll come back down over here and then boom"
"5524960","5531900"," heading into June shocker will be right around four thousand again that's right here right in there"
"5531900","5540240"," something like that you see that how it plays itself out down here risk protection for JPM down"
"5540240","5547980"," here to lower lows market is kind of pinned to make any sense a promise of 430 even if we"
"5547980","5554320"," tag it it gets ripped right back down with the right back in here into the middle of summer that's"
"5554320","5560020"," not my that's the implication that I see the risk to the downside is probably gonna be a weak"
"5560020","5564500"," moment in the beginning of the month in April you might get a low in here and then we ripped"
"5564500","5568860"," that faces off for the month of April come back down into the middle of summer while everybody's"
"5568860","5573660"," starting to travel and then you'll see that face ripping rally there in July and then back down at"
"5573660","5579400"," the middle again you guys thought I forgot about the JPM caller I know some of y'all there thought"
"5579400","5588040"," I thought I forgot about the JPM caller and fuck no okay"
"5588040","5596720"," that's probably the implication it's probably the implication for the market"
"5596720","5606440"," expect I'm expect that range into"
"5606440","5611880"," that's the expectation now with all that said all that like bluster and bullshit that I just told"
"5611880","5621860"," you all that bluster and bullshit can be erased and that would be"
"5621860","5630460"," any kind of closing below this stuff down here any kind of an unknown news to the market anything"
"5630460","5635020"," we don't know any kind of like that shit comes out 54 and a high yield of four spot one"
"5635020","5641360"," five percent four spot one five percent so the US selling 61 billion dollars of four-week bills and"
"5641360","5647220"," awards 57 spots are starting to squeeze higher no sellers above right now we already took out our"
"5647220","5652180"," one no reason we can't go higher than this now we already took this one out our one in the"
"5652180","5659080"," H line is gone you can see on book map that there's no more sellers there logical target above 399"
"5659080","5669010"," 92 yeah so that's what I'm expecting I'm gonna expect us to be range bound maybe"
"5669010","5676110"," maybe attack 4080 410 on the high for right now still a magnet down below try to pull us down"
"5676110","5679790"," below that number for the for the collars that are out there I know it's not the largest collar out"
"5679790","5685770"," there if people follow it enough to where there's psychology and they actually trade to so that"
"5685770","5693030"," makes that trade bigger for end of quarter so you mean we remain range bound you're gonna be"
"5693030","5699150"," waiting to see what the new collar is my my likelihood I expected to be a target of like 420"
"5699150","5708070"," for an upside maybe maybe it's 410 because then we'll get the 420 possibly 430 and pull back down"
"5708070","5716550"," afterwards somewhere in there it's like 410 or 420 or so on the upside target that would leave the"
"5716550","5724630"," room to get to 430 and then drag the market back down I mean I'll tell you what guess who's"
"5724630","5731750"," happiest in this way the banks are the banks are happiest they can provide consistent returns to"
"5731750","5741130"," their clients they can say look we stabilize the market and your 401k is safe we have consistent"
"5741130","5746590"," returns month over month and we only have one or two bad months a year you know we had a"
"5746590","5751210"," bad month in July we had a bad month September but otherwise we're consistent all your long"
"5751210","5761160"," consistent returns Tony's saying"
"5761160","5771120"," 58 million call spike you guys see that SPX if you"
"5771120","5778280"," didn't see what I just what I just drew out for you I'm gonna I'm gonna bet you that we're"
"5778280","5785620"," close we're close to that unless there's something we don't know we're we're close to that unless"
"5785620","5789840"," there's some we don't know unless you see some kind of wild-ass shit come out from JPM where"
"5789840","5799340"," they're like I don't know 1600 the 2800 and fucking like 310 on their heads"
"5799340","5806680"," look the fuck out but if you don't see something like that probably our range so we're gonna do the"
"5806680","5815260"," range we're gonna trade for the next quarter we do though I want to say something to you in June"
"5815260","5823140"," or July we typically have one massive sell-off like a like a out-of-range Sigma move so I"
"5823140","5828800"," wouldn't be surprised to see us hit fourth or at 370 the next three months for a moment or"
"5828800","5838560"," something just be be sober about it if you're a bull and we trade 430 be sober about hitting"
"5838560","5845120"," 430 try to be sober about it like don't be like drinking the fucking Kool-Aid and being like we"
"5845120","5851980"," hit 430 we're going to 490 don't say that shit because it's it's it's not good it's not we can't"
"5851980","5856840"," happen but it's not the likely outcome if you're a bear we trade down a 470 at some point the"
"5856840","5864560"," summer the likely outcome is that that's like 370 is 360 ish is the likely bottom for for that time"
"5864560","5874380"," period unless there's let's just something we don't know as a retailer the probability is not on"
"5874380","5891040"," your favor yeah we'll"
"5891040","5897660"," have some weakness I think what normally what so I we we should get some weakness in April some"
"5897660","5906120"," usually it's for usually it's for positioning it's gonna depend what it's gonna depend"
"5906120","5912800"," I'm gonna assume it so today's what 23rd of March quarter is almost over right we're coming in have"
"5912800","5919280"," some we're coming to a major quad-witching you're more than likely going to see a range bound"
"5919280","5925240"," trading into end-of-month and the quarter you're gonna likely see spreads get printed positioning"
"5925240","5934660"," meetings taking place not you and I but people that actually own this market and they're gonna say"
"5934660","5943760"," well what do we want it to go so if you're looking for major positioning the market it might be"
"5943760","5951120"," good like it might be good for you to wait until that until that that collar comes out"
"5951120","5959380"," instead of like pointing your finger and being like we're gonna crash tomorrow that most of that"
"5959380","5965060"," risk is gone right now you'll see some vol from that Senate hearing the volatility from that Senate"
"5965060","5969920"," here so there's a couple things you got to think about there's two things the way to think about"
"5969920","5974520"," right now if you're a bear if you're a bull there's two things major things you have to think about"
"5974520","5983100"," first one is going to be the first one is gonna be the Senate hearing the rhetoric can"
"5983100","5993100"," can definitely leave some risk here because you're gonna hear some real dumbasses out"
"5993100","6002760"," there that are running for office trying to make themselves sound"
"6002760","6010140"," like they're actually going to do something for their constituents that would be irrational well"
"6010140","6017500"," and you're gonna hear some some batshit crazy stuff like yelling saying that we're not considering"
"6017500","6023780"," two hundred fifty thousand dollar raising well I don't I agree with her to the extent that all"
"6023780","6033020"," deposits should not be insured but there's and she tried to be tactful about it to an extent"
"6033020","6040700"," what you really want to see is like a blend you want to see like you want to see the"
"6040700","6050680"," FDIC limit raised insurable insurable deposits it was weird to hear that yesterday because"
"6050680","6057140"," of maybe wonder if they ultimately do think that the dollar is going to raise in value that they're"
"6057140","6060640"," going to actually fight inflation that would increase the value of the dollar which would mean that"
"6060640","6068100"," you'd want to still keep the rate or the two and a few thousand dollar ceiling on that but the"
"6068100","6075900"," truth is it's like talking to an 80 year old that complains about buying a steak for 65 bucks you"
"6075900","6083560"," know they don't have really have anything based in reality as to what's a small business owner"
"6083560","6089960"," keeps on hand for cash like a small business owner easily keeps two hundred fifty thousand five"
"6089960","6096140"," hundred thousand on hand month to month for spending money it's not a lot of money I know that you"
"6096140","6102940"," might think it is but it's not it's not a lot of money times have changed the dollar has become"
"6102940","6110140"," cheaper two hundred fifty thousand dollars is peanuts so I would I agree with Andy constant they"
"6110140","6116180"," need to raise that that number probably to like 350 would be the low end if they only do it"
"6116180","6123680"," every decade or two maybe it is five hundred thousand dollars but the other side of this coin is"
"6123680","6130540"," twofold I agreed with Jerome Powell yesterday too on some of what he said he he said things that we"
"6130540","6137600"," talked about yesterday and I agreed with I was speaking with Joe yesterday and I was like I was"
"6137600","6142640"," like you know I was like these prime banks don't have a lot of maneuverability they're tied into"
"6142640","6149920"," their charters to hedge themselves immediately like 60 to 65 percent of the money that they take in"
"6149920","6156360"," these regional banks are not now if we if in those Senate hearings you might hear rhetoric that'll"
"6156360","6160840"," add ball but if you hear any kind of voting that's passed down the road where you're like yeah"
"6160840","6167740"," we're gonna require these regionals or these BC back bank or BC or banks that cater to BC's to"
"6167740","6175720"," hedge to 60 percent or 65 percent I think that's insane I think there's it's a tool it's a two "
"6175720","6183120","-part process and I think Jerome had it right yesterday his point was hey these these banks are"
"6183120","6192980"," taking or giving risky loans and they didn't hedge and they had money freed up to hedge so unlike"
"6192980","6200500"," a prime bank that maybe is all in already hedging at the worst possible time before rates are"
"6200500","6206400"," increased these fucking regional banks these banks that back BC's they're cash rich they're making"
"6206400","6213670"," fat money and they telegraphed their rates were going up and they had all the opportunity in the"
"6213670","6221370"," world to hedge hedge the market hedge any way they wanted they got a hedge the stock market they"
"6221370","6225430"," got a hedge the bond market they could have there's a million things they could have done to make"
"6225430","6231190"," money to protect themselves and they didn't so there's that aspect to it but it's not shouldn't be"
"6231190","6236290"," a hammer it should be you have to keep X amount of dollars in a savings account I show you"
"6236290","6245170"," not in a savings account making five percent if certain economic conditions happen and then if you"
"6245170","6250170"," trigger a run in the bank you have to start buying bonds I mean not buying bonds but paying people"
"6250170","6257350"," off this account or you start buying bonds when they when they become when rates go up they become"
"6257350","6263650"," more able you have more ability to sell them on a need and a need to need basis like a"
"6263650","6268630"," month to month basis and these regional banks actually had that opportunity where prime banks"
"6268630","6273250"," didn't now so you might have to put some kind of rules in that but here's the here's the here's"
"6273250","6280650"," the most fucked up laughable part is that these VC's these are the smartest guys in the room right"
"6280650","6285170"," so if you're if you know if you know these guys I know these guys he's hanging out with them"
"6285170","6291410"," he's live out West I lived in the West and I hung out with VC's all the time as opposed"
"6291410","6297970"," to pictures on Twitter I'll be hanging out with that crowd on Twitter in the past I know these guys"
"6297970","6304290"," if these guys are that fucking smart right there are products out there to protect their bank"
"6304290","6310190"," investments so if I keep I don't know 50 million in a bank it's the only bank or one of"
"6310190","6315150"," the only small bottom-minded banks it's gonna take my business there's their products out there for"
"6315150","6320210"," me to protect that investment so any of these companies they're like well we're gonna lose all our"
"6320210","6326050"," money I have no fucking love for you I don't care about you that you made some dumb shit excuses"
"6326050","6330290"," and I saw in a forum some of these people were like why work for what some of these companies"
"6330290","6337130"," and we definitely didn't do that and I'm sorry man I got no love for you I got nothing if"
"6338630","6348310"," you couldn't figure that out on your own I don't know what to say to you I mean my friends"
"6348310","6356670"," and I have trusts for our houses right these are basic things wealth protection even if it's not a"
"6356670","6362290"," lot of wealth I got less wealth than these guys in my own attorney knows how to protect my wealth"
"6362290","6369290"," so it's just pure insanity that these people don't know how to protect their own wealth especially"
"6369290","6375570"," if they don't have FDI and C insurance so they might have to be might have just be some more"
"6375570","6382430"," rules I don't think you need to put a that's my point here is when those center hearings come up"
"6382430","6388910"," the ball will come from the rhetoric but then you don't want to see laws passed that hinder VCs"
"6388910","6395630"," from doing business like this bank you have to be 65% right off the get-go from this point"
"6395630","6404830"," board that's wrong they just have to have have triggers in place to protect those investments from"
"6404830","6412310"," from these companies they want to still encourage these these VCs to grow their businesses but then"
"6412310","6416750"," at the other side we need to go after these fucking companies they're investing in say we're gonna"
"6416750","6423530"," now require you to protect yourself with your own private insurance or this bank can't allow you to"
"6423530","6428990"," put your money into the bank so there's like that balance so you're gonna get vol from the Senate"
"6428990","6433490"," hearings and you're gonna get some dumb shit said from people like yelling you're gonna see dumb"
"6433490","6439810"," shit said from politicians that are trying to get votes that are coming up but then you want to you"
"6439810","6446030"," want to see what happens such a first ball then for the leading end of the month then into the"
"6446030","6455950"," quarter this is the big one for the bears and the bulls the debt ceiling now the debt"
"6455950","6461610"," ceiling is always an issue if you're young out there and you're listening right now the debt the"
"6461610","6469210"," debt ceiling is utter and total bullshit it means nothing only that means nothing it's summertime"

"7390460","7398000"," need to see if the market is hedged on that or if it's not because it only becomes important not"

"7461590","7470390"," how it's talked about into June if you're a bear you should be quiet about it like the more quiet"
"7470390","7478070"," you are about it the more you don't harp on it publicly the more you don't spread rumors and"

"7519150","7524850"," where I have to I can only put it on like on a high like maybe I'm timing it right"
"7524850","7530670"," now or like I'll keep it on my radar in a June 1st but maybe it's something where instead of"
"7530670","7534610"," just slapping on some way out of money zero day puts in the beginning of June maybe you have to"
"7534610","7540470"," wait for a high in the first or second or third week of June do they try to pull that"
"7540470","7546570"," bullshit early is it becoming on a vent is it becomes something where I'm selling puts to people"
"7546570","7554750"," leading into that event maybe even more you know if it's being screamed about publicly enough"
"7554750","7563070"," maybe selling puts to people for mid or late June and just collect the money on the ball"

"7630590","7635570"," like fuck yeah we are now he's in the twitch chat talking about buying bank stonks for their"
"7635570","7645410"," earnings my personal feeling is if they're selling stonks into"
"7645410","7651570"," earnings they continue to if they if you're gonna buy stonks into earnings they're probably already"
"7651570","7658610"," being run up in earnings they'll flatten out then they'll sell the news and then I got the"
"7658610","7666870"," youtubers are like roll this market down a 380 right now what did I leave you with yesterday what"
"7666870","7673490"," did I say to you in the stream yesterday I said 390 said 392 is gonna be defended didn't I"
"7673490","7683110"," you guys you bears are fucking relentless I love you bears come into the belly yesterday I'm like"
"7683110","7688350"," we're gonna defend 392 over here I guarantee it you guys like fuck no and then earlier in the day"
"7688350","7695230"," I'm like earlier yesterday in the stream I'm like if we if we blast through 392 like this shouldn't"
"7695230","7700170"," victim with central banks who have to probably fucked I'm like but if we dip our heads down they're"
"7700170","7710150"," probably coming back up and there we are right we're right back right back"
"7710150","7719670"," to protect in 392 you all need an event man look at"
"7719670","7729590"," that look at that beautiful support down there beer is raging"
"7729590","7739330"," right now can the markets still tank"
"7739330","7744070"," yeah I can but so let's talk about that so MOOC said market can still take my point isn't that"
"7744070","7753850"," bar even though I'm making my point clear enough so move this is for you my pointy move is so"
"7753850","7763790"," let's say this is price okay and this is May and the threat this is"
"7763790","7770650"," June and I agree with that premise that the market can still tank my point is we're coming in an"
"7770650","7776610"," anime right here right and the threat shows itself and I think as a trader you're like yeah it's"
"7776610","7783690"," just gonna go down what happens is the threat presents itself and because everybody's going short"
"7783690","7791150"," the market starts squeezing and then once the market can tank actually happens the market just"
"7791150","7797510"," blast down to right here again does it make sense for price wise to some price you understand this"
"7797510","7802810"," this part of that trade so that's my question is yeah let's say that the risk can make the market"
"7802810","7808150"," tank doesn't does that mean I have to actively look for when the short is is it actually like later"
"7808150","7815550"," in June does that make sense so I'm not disagreeing what you're saying I'm talking about price here"
"7815550","7820910"," so I could like hedge right here and then the market screams higher than comes as a matter of fact"
"7820910","7830470"," into yesterday to your point I would say to your point that yesterday I had had some 365 P's that"
"7830470","7839090"," burned to the ground and then I forgot about some puts that I had from a ratio until I was"
"7839090","7845410"," after the bell yesterday or just just into the bell or something I realized that I was still"
"7845410","7854610"," holding a ratio spread side of a ratio spread I was holding some 392 P's and they were like"
"7854610","7860890"," worthless and they actually printed and lost some money on that trade yesterday because they were"
"7860890","7866710"," up at like 28 cents and they went down to like 18 cents when I was trying to like sell"
"7866710","7874510"," sell sell sell sell so that's my point I guess into June is maybe I placed the trade on some"
"7874510","7880170"," puts the market screams higher and then it comes back down maybe don't get the print until they're"
"7880170","7890400"," expiring at the end of the money but not what I was anticipating you know"
"7890400","7913720"," that like 5,000% print or something you understand"
"7913720","7922320"," I'm saying yeah move like I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not into what you're saying I'm saying like"
"7922320","7929380"," the tactfulness of trading that play because I think the play is there too man I'm with you on that"
"7929380","7939040"," I think it comes an issue this year I think it's I think if you're I'm not a Republican"
"7939040","7945720"," but I think the Republicans will push that issue this year I would if I was a Republican I'd push"
"7945720","7952420"," it I'd push that issue in the June definitely I try to if I was a Republican I'd be trying"
"7952420","7959100"," to make this market look like dog shit more any any chance that I have to wreck this market into"
"7959100","7966140"," the election season I'd be fucking taking it if I was Republican that's what I would do just from"

"8059910","8069810"," weak again cotton all this not so much I"
"8069810","8074530"," wouldn't I mean you can trade this short down here but for weakness you're looking for this one"
"8074530","8080450"," right here this is where the money shot is down here that's 380 we're heading to 38 it's a hundred"
"8080450","8089090"," point move right there it's a hundred fucking what is that a more than a hundred point move right"

"10690370","10696530"," with all of this said here this kind of this kind of equals the VIX going to let's say 21"
"10696530","10705830"," 50 or 22 50 if the VIX though can consolidate and move higher than those numbers then you'll end up"
"10705830","10712770"," seeing not just this capitulation down but start bloodbathing down and these bears can start to"
"10712770","10719770"," have their way with the market now i'm short right here well long puts but i want you to realize"
"10719770","10726830"," that um in here is this this is that volatility zone so just just as we come down here just"
"10726830","10730790"," some volatility in here we'll also pay attention to the five-minute charge of this red line right"
"10730790","10737290"," here this is kind of sneaking in right now so uh you know even though you see these triggers i"

"10747790","10758310"," the play could be dead is my point even on an extension at PT two for the day um"
"10758310","10766450"," and there are some other things down here i want you to look at so we have down below uh"
"10766450","10774490"," the opening i got PT two here but it's probably yeah i've got the PT two here because of this"
"10774490","10779170"," low right here watch my cursor right here this is the low on the day and cash market low is"
"10779170","10785490"," where PT two is you know bear wants to have a new low right a lower low on the daily"
"10785490","10790910"," so this is a big one PT two and then we got some gaps to fill down below here that"
"10790910","10796230"," were left behind by bulls and then we've got the closing price down here at PT four so just be"

"10835340","10844600"," if PT two gets given up if PT two gets given up then you'll end up seeing uh some gaps"
"10844600","10851040"," being filled down here and then this then then this uh recheck below here of the closing price and"
"10851040","10857440"," that's closing price right over there to be aware of all this uh i'm not going to expect bears to"
"10857440","10863980"," get much more than i mean like your highest probability is we tag here the second most high"
"10863980","10869820"," probability for bears would be this PT two but it's not as high of a probability as this PT one"

"13142920","13152830"," in the 15 minute it's saying fuck no we're going up still showing 390 39"
"13152830","13166410"," down here this one's showing the 393 again let's look on a daily an hourly move"
"13166410","13176280"," this one over that's that 393 showing"
"13176280","13182100"," itself again 394 and this is bad the one thing i do want you to see here what what is"
"13182100","13187220"," bad about this and this is sideways see this sideways on an hourly remember i was talking to you"
"13187220","13195400"," guys about um the sideways trade on spx and spy uh but on an hourly chart at least you see"
"13195400","13201160"," trend rolling over here now that's not a healthy sign on an hourly see this this trend rolling down"
"13203240","13212680"," um that's not good oh that's not good at all is it on a daily"
"13212680","13224800"," uh trend is saying more down they're"
"13224800","13231180"," saying price over time should be higher yeah that's that sideways and right man this is this is on"
"13231180","13239480"," a daily i get that i get that i get that so it's basically saying to you here like up"
"13239480","13247080"," and then down then sideways to the right and up over time may june july um you can only trust"
"13247080","13255620"," to hear though so it is calling for more down at least that's that that's still that three nine"
"13255620","13265320"," three eight three ninety two somewhere in there three three ninety two"
"13265320","13276540"," there's that three ninety two right here three eighty eight slightly lower here's"
"13276540","13285000"," that three d eight down there doggo mcgagel face is claiming uh s one kind of like a dip to"
"13285000","13304130"," buy for bulls makes sense at least you know five bars out five days out what"
"13304130","13314020"," happens now this is a good day key here is for"
"13314020","13318940"," bears to uh main so point being here is this if you guys want to know the rest of the"
"13318940","13326600"," day i'll show you uh so bears are needing to defend this area right now bears want to defend uh"
"13326600","13334080"," all of this right here you see the red line coming down so bears want to defend all this right"
"13334080","13344130"," here they have a lot of room to defend and they"
"13344130","13353970"," want time for this five minute to come down here they need time to get down here uh so"
"13353970","13363810"," with that said it's this same see this uh just see this right here i'll make it wider for you"
"13363810","13373110"," so right there just bears just need some time here it doesn't matter if we squeeze higher so if we"
"13373110","13380370"," squeeze higher right now now if we squeeze higher bears have all this time here to make us go lower"
"13381230","13387930"," bear trade though is dead if price goes above and the bulls can take over here but what bulls need"
"13387930","13392970"," to see is this i'll show you the uh i'll show you when the trade becomes dead for bears and"
"13392970","13396590"," i'm going to look at the velocity here in just a minute with you and see if we can glean"
"13396590","13405460"," anything else but right here bulls want to see this and remember i told you about this one earlier"
"13405460","13414620"," it's now lower uh the bulls need to see price come higher and get above 396"
"13414620","13424600"," 67 right here this red box is now lower it's right here now"
"13424600","13432320"," right here watching the squeeze right now should be tagging this 396 67 on the same kind of a deal"
"13432320","13442180"," as before bears need to hold 396 67 uh they want to get under here and start selling this down"
"13442780","13450140"," now if price if the i'll look to see if the trade is dead right now for bears just right"
"13450140","13463940"," here if"
"13463940","13471620"," you're a bull you can't with any safety take this trade unless price gets above and it actually"
"13471620","13479280"," comes like like tests there and goes starts going higher so a bull trade is above 396 80 currently"
"13479280","13485360"," 396 80 for bulls oh that's when they take a safe trade higher otherwise bears still in charge right"
"13485360","13494060"," now and bears on this trade are looking for a rejection of 396 80 and a move lower to uh"
"13494060","13501260"," 392 10 right down here this is what the bear is looking for 392 10 down here some conviction that"
"13501260","13507380"," the market's rolling over uh so they can get underneath that 392 get down to 398 388 take us down"
"13507380","13520190"," to 380 bears"
"13520190","13529940"," man relentless sellers in the market apple also"
"13529940","13535500"," just as an indicator if you're bearish or bullish here apple has a lower high so i'm going to give"
"13535500","13540760"," you a warning if you're a bull uh apple has a lower high they were unable to get a new"
"13540760","13548220"," high uh on their hourly trigger that is bearish uh regardless it's bearish uh on an hourly at least"
"13548220","13553840"," on an hourly basis the bulls were not able to get a new high on the hourly now if the"
"13553840","13559700"," bulls are not able to close the day so we've got the hourly down to the bear side and we're"
"13559700","13566020"," looking for the daily close with no new high on apple so i want you to think about that if"
"13566020","13573920"," apple does not get a new high on the close it is very bearish for uh for the stock market"
"13574800","13580140"," so i want you to pay attention into this close uh as this develops i want you to pay attention"
"13580140","13585520"," to do the bulls recover they start to make try to make a new high and does apple make a"
"13585520","13591300"," new high today it's going to be an important piece of the puzzle petting into tomorrow and next"
"13591300","13597220"," week for you for the market for um the next few hours the close today it's going to be very"
"13597220","13610720"," important for you to pay attention to this uh as we close this day out today you'll"
"13610720","13616000"," see the bears are up here trying to do pull the same tricks that they pulled earlier see them right"
"13616000","13623670"," here they're going to try to sell this back down again and try to sell into you there's a key"
"13623670","13629110"," thing here for you to be paying attention to does apple get a new high or not on the daily"
"13629110","13634890"," so on the hourly they have not at this point got a new high hourly and daily what they do"
"13634890","13642030"," is they decide a future trend intraday and on a weekly basis so if you want to know what the"
"13642030","13646750"," next week's gonna unfold for you you want to see no new highs on the hourly you want to see"
"13646750","13682660"," no new highs on the daily intraday and if you see that it's going to be looking bearish yeah"
"13682660","13687860"," bull's got a new high in the day it's still on as of right now i want to show you"
"13687860","13692020"," something here i want to show you something that's like even though i'm giving you the bear case"
"13692020","13701560"," here i want to show you something so um let me explain this further to you yeah"
"13701560","13711160"," we're gonna look at this on a"
"13711160","13719940"," let's do this together as a group here so there's a one-minute chart this doesn't mean as much"
"13719940","13726220"," let's go to a 30-minute chart here this is what we're looking for here i want you to see"
"13726220","13730320"," what i'm what i'm trying to explain to you here okay so try to pay attention to this part of"
"13730320","13739230"," the broadcast kind of important and uh want to explain something to you here if you're a bear pay"
"13739230","13748490"," attention it's important for you to pay attention now if you are a"
"13748490","13758120"," bull on apple the trait this is a daily velocity down here see how this"
"13758120","13767280"," velocity is like coming to a bottom it's time to start thinking about longs watch my we're starting"
"13767280","13776160"," to top out even if price is not showing you you have i want you to remember this even if"
"13776160","13784880"," price is not showing you even if price continues higher if we start bottoming out down here"
"13784880","13793800"," it's showing you that there's less participation in this move to the high it's forewarning you uh"
"13793800","13799800"," that this could start trading lower and if it does and you don't want to get caught in this because"
"13799800","13807600"," it could be a bloodbath lower does that make sense now currently at this moment you're seeing uh a"
"13807600","13813300"," re currently we're saying no we're not going down there's more buyers stepping in so right now this"
"13813300","13818260"," is still looking bullish and strong right on the daily at least it's looking strong my point to you"
"13818260","13824540"," is on the day for today's daily uh apple still has a chance to get a new high uh we"
"13824540","13830320"," if we see a failure of a new high on apple it's going to start showing you forewarning you that"
"13830320","13835900"," we're going to start selling this market but they have the daily now on the hourly that's the green"
"13835900","13842180"," one velocity uh we don't have the new high right we had a failure of the new high and that's"
"13842180","13847780"," actually showing you down the road that if we start getting no new high in the daily it's"
"13847780","13855100"," foretelling you that the market's about to roll over now we're going to pay attention to the rest"
"13855100","13863730"," of today to see what else that means we're also going to spy right now and the spy is telling"
"13863730","13867590"," you otherwise right spies telling you spies"
"13867590","13877410"," telling you information right now though the spy says"
"13877410","13885410"," it's weak on the hourly but not the daily so spies able to get a new new high in the"
"13885410","13890550"," daily you're going to see this come up does that make sense so whereas apple might be weak spy may"
"13890550","13897270"," not be if you get the lower close on the on apple might be telling you yeah uh we're actually"
"13897270","13904330"," going to make some big lows down here okay just pay attention to this if this develops the daily is"
"13904330","13908830"," going to be key here for the next few moments the other thing that i would tell you here is"
"13908830","13915730"," that the market right now looks strong on a macro it doesn't like a like a one month and a"
"13915730","13922770"," weekly and a um a three month it doesn't on velocity it doesn't look good at all just look back"
"13922770","13931150"," here and this is kind of showing you that i wouldn't expect too much down in the spy even if"
"13931150","13937050"," even if apple pulls back maybe you'll see uh xlf pull up does it make sense so xlf will kind"
"13937050","13943130"," of hold up uh the s&p 500 so if you're looking for like major damage to spy i'm going"
"13943130","13950190"," to doubt it as of right now i'm going to look for a dip to be bought at 392 maybe"
"13950190","13955510"," even a capitulation at 388 but i'm not seeing the death and destruction that you're seeing at least"
"13955510","13960830"," on the spy so if the spy comes down here i'm going to expect this to be bought and i'm"
"13960830","13966830"," going to expect apple to trade down to its um to its daily you might see more damage in tech"
"13966830","13974410"," but not in spy now you might see some other sectors in spy help it out whereas you might see"
"13974410","13981110"," more damage in uh beta high beta stocks like like apple so right now uh it's all kind of saying"
"13981110","13990290"," uh market roll over not seeing as much damage in the spy you know"
"13990290","13994550"," like you might see the damage down below here in the spy you might see spy go down in like"
"13994550","14002650"," 392 388 but i'm not seeing the spy going down to like uh 360 something like that right now i'm"
"14002650","14007810"," not seeing it so i see it in tech but i don't see it quite like the damage that you'd"
"14007810","14016140"," see in apple going down now so i'm going to expect less damage in the downside to uh for bulls"
"14016140","14020660"," i would if you're a bull you're probably looking to buy 388 392 somewhere in there i'm going to"
"14020660","14026060"," expect some weakness into this close bears want to get this week closed as well into tomorrow so if"
"14026060","14030560"," you're a seller uh you want to start placing your bets we're on one minute chart here right so this"
"14030560","14036100"," is no big deal you're going to place like a weekly or a monthly um a monthly uh position area"
"14036100","14041620"," in a monthly position for some downside in the money put spread or something like that uh if you're"
"14041620","14047180"," going to be uh bearish on tech i'd be more aggressive and with my bearishness on tech than i would"
"14047180","14061600"," with spy retesting"
"14061600","14071080"," the lows again at uh 394 92 price target down below"
"14071080","14077160"," 392 10 i said 392 we're retesting those at 394 96 and we're going to be looking to get down"
"14077160","14087130"," here to the 392 10 here bear case still alive as long as we stay below this uh this"
"14087130","14104030"," dotted white line here for you"
"14104030","14110150"," now thanks for a little for saying something yeah i'm not seeing the um i think i'm seeing i'm"
"14110150","14116110"," seeing weakness in spy but not to the extent that i see it in uh in tech or like the"
"14116110","14134140"," pullback in tech are probably more severe than it would be in uh spy i'm going"

"19677640","19685790"," not all this is all this is all this is right now my view is for bears to come down"
"19685790","19692910"," here and then get their next trade lower right here this is going to be the continuation trade for"
"19692910","19698790"," bears on the downside as long as bears can hold above this stuff or hold below this stuff they are"

"19742190","19749450"," bulls best chance here or what a bull wants to see like the best best bet for a bull is"
"19749450","19757870"," a bloodbath into this bell to close the gap on HYG down to $73.20 and that would be the"
"19757870","19767630"," dip to buy now if that doesn't play out today the bull trade here is only good enough"
"19767630","19776920"," to then go back down and close the gap on HYG I don't like leaving this gap behind on HYG"
"19776920","19785420"," the gap is back from the 21st it's a weekly gap down below four bulls so if we close higher"
"19785420","19790240"," today I'd be looking for the short and my point area guess is if we close higher today I'd be"

"20217940","20223180"," going to true trade and range right here balance range and here uh so i prefer that as a bull"
"20223180","20229980"," buy in the low what i don't want to see is uh squeeze up into this bell because then i'm"
"20229980","20235820"," going to bet that we trade down into tomorrow into friday down here that's that's my bet into"
"20235820","20243320"," tomorrow does that make sense to you uh do my expectation here is that we like you want to know"
"20243320","20249800"," how you get fucked you get fucked by squeezing up into this bell right they don't give the bear"
"20249800","20253980"," what he wants down here they don't give the bull the dip he wants and we get that trade right"
"20253980","20258180"," up into this bell here uh what does that mean for tomorrow i'm assuming that you think that we're"
"20258180","20262940"," going to they're going to blast higher into friday maybe maybe we squeeze higher to friday than"
"20262940","20268980"," sell friday uh close i can see that too i can see that i can see that i can get"
"20268980","20274800"," your point here uh we're going to look at it from another perspective though in just a moment uh"
"20274800","20279820"," the squeeze higher here trade is definitely on i know for sure that as long as we stay below this"
"20279820","20285480"," this white line right here the sellers are still in charge i know the sellers are in charge here uh"
"20285480","20290960"," as long as price stays below right here sellers are in charge now with all that said with all that"
"20290960","20297660"," said with all that said with all that said i'm not changing my viewpoint here on the market and i"
"20297660","20304120"," haven't and i'm not gonna so i want to show you this right here it was a five minute let's"
"20304120","20313900"," do it daily and i showed you this right here right this is four zero six zero"
"20313900","20320500"," above and this green box right here i said to you really this morning as long as we stay above"
"20320500","20328580"," this green box right you're going to trade in here to make sense into the 31st now if this doesn't"
"20328580","20337000"," recover here and starts to sell down uh that trade is over right the sideways pin into the 31st is"
"20337000","20346700"," over so if we're at prices below the green box which it is right 399 or 3969"
"20346700","20352960"," or below the box right now and so it's the job is on the bears to sell this market down"
"20352960","20359980"," from here now it be that rejection trade down into the 31st that's where you get your 386 to 380"
"20359980","20366540"," down here into the 31st does that make sense and you can kind of see it developing right now right"
"20366540","20372780"," right on this daily right here this morning you saw we broke below the the or the uh the trade"
"20372780","20378340"," higher here into the 31st and when we broke below this it opens the door to a to a lower"
"20378340","20384340"," range down here so look at this 3808 down below and i want to see this down here now if"
"20384340","20391180"," they push it down below get free daily points Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up as"
"20391180","20401040"," long as they continue to tee off here this support turns into resistance i'm going to change this"
"20401040","20409690"," to red or to yellow at least and now you can see that the ball is inside of the bears"
"20409690","20415170"," court right you got the ball back in the bears court you got tried to go up they told you"
"20415170","20420930"," no right you had no no call buyers up in here you came back down you came back up and"
"20420930","20427790"," you couldn't hold here right to take this trip higher you see how that broke down here see inverted"
"20427790","20435590"," head and shoulders inverted head and shoulders at this point has been uh you've been told fuck you"
"20435590","20439370"," know we're not we don't have an inverted head and shoulders is telling you the move is actually"
"20439370","20447010"," down so with that said the risk is to the bulls right now does it make sense to you the"
"20447010","20456550"," inverted head and shoulders is not there for the for the spy and as long as price stays below here"
"20456550","20463170"," on the spy the move is down does it make sense and the move is to sell anything in here"
"20463170","20470670"," like you sell this right here the first chance you get you sell it and with stops above right here"
"20470670","20475810"," okay so the trade right now if you're bull and you want to take this trade long in the close"
"20475810","20481590"," i understand that you take trade long in the close but the truth is that a bear and a seller"
"20481590","20491570"," is trying to sell from up high here right so i'm looking to buy some puts i'm looking"
"20491570","20501480"," to buy some puts right here then i'm looking to have some stops above right"
"20501480","20512040"," here or even an ad above right here right so puts maybe ad and then even stops up here so"
"20512040","20517420"," as far as the seller is concerned they don't care does that make sense you can you can talk all"
"20517420","20524180"," the shit you want here right now you trend we're now below trend right now one hour four hour and"
"20524180","20529460"," daily trend is is shaping up for a down move not a nut move if you were telling me earlier"
"20529460","20535700"," today or if you're telling me or if i'm telling you as long as we hold here the move the"
"20535700","20541060"," inverted head and shoulders is valid and it's it's likely and bound to go up but with this move"
"20541060","20547520"," lower here right we break below uh the the bears have the benefit of the doubt here that we're"
"20547520","20554400"," going lower does it make sense so all this is noise right here right this is like you're either"
"20554400","20559720"," teeing off here or you're either longing puts above or longing calls above here right now there's"
"20559720","20566940"," no real trade um there's no real trade here for me for tomorrow i got nothing here uh there's a"
"20566940","20571940"," possibility of a squeeze up of this close but truthfully if you're a bull you really want to see"
"20571940","20577660"," like because you know there's buyers down here you want to see that bloodbath down here you know"
"20577660","20583840"," there's some balance down here it's something you can buy uh for a trade higher uh so without sit"
"20583840","20588380"," without any of that stuff right now that the ball is in the the bear sport for me for the"
"20588380","20594520"," ending the day like this we're rendering we're ending the day on a low not a new high you have"
"20594520","20598580"," a failure back here to make a new high you have a lower high on a Thursday here you have"
"20598580","20608100"," a new low down below from yesterday right right here new high uh new lower high new low new lower"
"20608100","20615540"," low these are bearish bearish bearish bearish stare casing down right no commitment from the bulls"
"20615540","20623320"," to get above right bulls couldn't hold it uh and you blasted below the dip buy down here so what"
"20623320","20627960"," does that tell you right it's telling you if you win back here and you're looking for continuation"
"20628440","20636900"," your it's it's point blank telling you that bulls have no no want to uh get into higher high on"
"20636900","20642120"," a Friday it's telling you that bulls are taking profit here and that we're probably gonna look for"
"20642120","20649340"," a lower our lower lower to buy down the road where is that lower low right where is it we"
"20649340","20654380"," got s2 down below here at 385 26 we also know that the options market is free to do whatever"

"20703620","20713500"," trade here for the bulls above right here but even with that trade you can't get long as a bull"
"20713500","20719720"," until you get above your second trade is here does that make sense so there's a trade above it is"
"20719720","20725740"," closed there is no trade for you as a bull in here this is no man's land it makes sense"
"20725740","20733120"," and until you trade above it check it then your move is higher does that make sense but just here"
"20733120","20737080"," that's all you got is a bull that's all you got then you hand the ball off to the bears"

"21536510","21541910"," your money and this is where you make your money the downside but just because you have a"
"21541910","21545870"," conviction that we're going there doesn't mean the pissed money away on it uh you're what you're"
"21545870","21550650"," looking for someone else to show you looking for computers to show you the way anyone that tells"
"21550650","21554510"," you that they trade this stuff all the time is going to be broken like six months or a year"
"21554510","21561210"," they'll be broken and they probably have a job they probably actually work a job that's the truth"
"21561210","21565950"," like anyone that's out there telling you they trade they trade this stuff regularly i'm doing a i'm"
"21565950","21571690"," doing it i'm doing a trade with you right now to tomorrow for about a grand uh but anyway it's"

"21596170","21603950"," the gap up um i'll trade it with you uh we should go more in a depth than that sometime"
"21604530","21611150"," we should go more in a depth into like how long is the trade valid i think we do that"
"21611150","21616670"," a lot i show you guys on hourly trend and daily trend when you're like you're good for a week"
"21616670","21622510"," or two weeks or three weeks on the upper downside where you can with confidence say something uh"
"21622510","21637670"," and when you should actually enter that trade otherwise you're day trading yeah"
"21637670","21644070"," yeah we'll talk about it you know what uh black beauty machine show up tomorrow and say something"

"21682650","21689850"," or three month call not a day trade make sense like a weekly and a monthly monthly trade if you're"
"21689850","21696870"," in a three month call here you're good to go so far nothing's changed for you right if your thesis"
