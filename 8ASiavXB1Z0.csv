"129050","129750"," Sound is good."
"130610","131110"," Right on."
"131570","132210"," Good morning, David. "

"147160","149820"," Trying to get in the habit of pressing the like button when it's in greetings. "
"150020","151300"," Thanks, I appreciate it."

"157060","157540"," All right."
"159080","160100"," We'll get started here."
"160940","161160"," Hi. "
"161460","161940"," Good to see you."
"163840","164860"," Good morning."
"165240","165820"," Good morning, everybody. "
"167040","167520"," All right."
"167600","168420"," Hope you all had a wonderful weekend."

"175400","176800"," Smash that like button."
"178480","179480"," Hope everybody's doing well. "
"179660","180720"," We've already had a wonderful weekend."
"182420","183640"," No, Jim, a gloom over the weekend."
"183780","184260"," That was good to see. "
"184400","184960"," Good morning, Joe."
"185140","187520"," Good to see you."
"188420","189240"," All right, everybody. "
"190040","192500"," So we didn't really have anything go happen over the weekend."
"193740","195640"," We're going to get through this really quick this morning."
"196260","200120"," Try to get as much information as they can out there for you as it is your Monday. "
"200940","202980"," We had the Chicago PMI this morning."
"203820","208360"," The actual report was 65.2, which is outstanding."
"209860","213020"," Chicago PMI is basically manufacturing orders. "
"213760","215500"," This is a very positive number that we got this morning."
"216040","219520"," We also have 1130 Mary daily speaking."
"220920","224880"," And then at 1240 PM, we have got S third George speaking. "
"225720","227100"," She's a hawk just so you know."
"227400","228520"," So 1240 in the afternoon."
"229220","234560"," It would be a perfect time for the day for the day to kind of come down if we're actually"
"234560","235200"," going up today. "
"235200","237220"," Just pencil that in your schedule today."
"238300","241000"," Mary daily is not really a I shouldn't say she's davish."
"241020","243320"," She is more in the middle of the road. "
"244300","245260"," We're very calm."
"246280","248800"," We also have a PMI final on Tuesday."
"249140","249620"," This should be good. "
"249840","254100"," ISM manufacturing index rate should prove itself good tomorrow."
"254820","260240"," This is all kind of good news for us moving into Tuesday."
"261000","263340"," One concern tomorrow would be construction spending. "
"264780","267820"," Construction has been going down as far as we know."
"268140","270400"," You know, we had unemployment numbers that came out or excuse me."
"270980","273280"," We had jobs numbers that came out last week. "
"273340","273980"," That was a surprise."
"276020","277440"," So we'll look for that as well."
"277820","278620"," I'm in the wrong dates here. "
"278980","279940"," I'm in the wrong dates."
"280280","280800"," Jesus Christ."
"281120","281780"," Hold on a second here. "
"282100","283500"," We had consumer credit this morning."
"284600","287860"," Excuse me this afternoon at 3 p.m. I'm going over last week's shit."
"288020","288580"," I'm like going through it. "
"288660","289040"," I'm like, wait a minute."
"289060","289680"," We've done all this."
"289680","292480"," We've got consumer credit at 3 p.m. today, right?"
"293120","298620"," We've got on Thursday is the big day, which is initial jobless claims, continuing claims. "
"299100","301460"," The key one is CPI on Thursday."
"301960","305820"," Otherwise, we don't have too much early this week on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."
"306040","310680"," We've got Loretta Mester and Michelle Bowman speak on Wednesday. "
"311100","312580"," Some reason I'm getting my dates wrong here."
"313380","318160"," Wednesday is a real, you could have some type of volatility on Wednesday."
"318160","320920"," And then mostly you're going to be looking for volatility on Thursday. "
"321060","321500"," Okay."
"321720","325160"," Those are the big ones this week for you to be considering."
"326380","330040"," University of Michigan consumer sentiment index can sometimes be volatile. "
"330960","331860"," Other times not."
"332080","334040"," Depends on how bad CPI is on Thursday."
"334920","341420"," It'll sometimes impact Friday's consumer sentiment index. "
"342360","344500"," So we don't have a big week this week ahead of us."
"344760","347160"," As far as I can see that we don't have a big week ahead of us this week."
"348500","350740"," Now we're going to move on to a couple of other things here. "
"350880","360040"," We're going to first look at the volume profile, market profile for this week on ES."
"360480","365260"," And I want you to take note real quick that we're coming up here on the right hand side."
"365260","371380"," You can see we really need to get above this 4,500 and possibly even as high as 4520. "
"371840","376980"," This is going to lead our conversation this morning that we need to get above here to make a run"
"376980","381020"," higher today to 4,585 or 4,600."
"381860","385780"," Well, actually we're going to look at 4,585 on a different chart here in a candlestick chart just"
"385780","386540"," coming up in a moment."
"388260","392400"," The point that I made in my post this morning on Twitter was that someone's going to get burned"
"392400","392900"," this morning. "
"393400","395380"," It could be the bulls or it could be the bears."
"395780","399060"," You can't really tell right off the bell this morning at 4,500."
"399940","401800"," So I just wanted to be keyed in on this. "
"402240","406860"," And if we do trade lower, we should be able to trade all the way down to 4,400."
"407480","410220"," Possibly even as low as 4,420s."
"410600","413760"," And this is going to lead into the next conversation that we're going to have here in a few"
"413760","413940"," minutes. "
"414420","419980"," So I think Spot Gamma came up this morning and said 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4 "
"419980","420840",",3,9,0."
"421720","425260"," As far down as here was as far as we could drop today."
"426000","427540"," But this is a key moment in the market. "
"427540","432240"," We're going to look at a candlestick chart here in a moment so I can show you what we're facing"
"432240","435280"," on the opening bell this morning and where we could reverse."
"435360","439260"," We could actually do a green bar up and then reverse straight down to the pits of hell."
"440120","446000"," So you may want to be waiting to take a long today after we trade above 4,5. "
"446700","454800"," Let's call it 4,5,14,73,4,5,20 basically."
"455340","456760"," Let's say we trade higher here."
"457000","460780"," You want to see us rest above and then take this to a higher level. "
"461520","466380"," We can also green bar it up right off the bell this morning and automatically reject."
"468000","475700"," If we wind up rejecting off this, I guess Spot Gamma showing 44,4, which is right in here."
"476200","482560"," But I would expect us to go much lower down to this 4,420 area down in this zone and"
"482560","484060"," possibly even trade lower. "
"484060","489240"," Yesterday, I think this saw someone on Twitter talking about as long as they don't break 45 or 43 "
"489240","489800",",50."
"490160","494340"," And that's generally true as long as they don't break down below this large level of support back"
"494340","494580"," here."
"494660","496960"," We should be okay in the spy today. "
"497420","500100"," I'm going to turn this off and I want to get over to a candlestick chart real quick."
"502130","504010"," Then we're going to talk some levels as well."
"504670","508910"," I'm going to reach you guys what Spot Gamma put out this morning, which was futures that are"
"508910","512289"," futures are flat to Friday close near 44,90. "
"513370","518770"," That they anticipate another day of high volatility of a 1.31% move."
"519630","527110"," Okay, resistance is at 45,20, which I just showed you on volume profile, followed by 45,54 and"
"527110","531090"," support lives at 44,44,43,90."
"532470","535270"," Today's data remains quite similar to that of last week. "
"536330","538010"," Implied volatility continues to hold the bid."
"539330","545150"," With the VIX here, 23, a VIX of 23 signals and implied one day move of 1%, which is slightly"
"545150","550970"," under our gamut based implied move 1.3%. Also notice that S&P realized volatility has shown below"
"550970","554450"," is at 19, which is at or near one year highs."
"556290","560710"," Now, I think we're going to have to rely upon the options flow, believe it or not today. "
"561190","566210"," I want to show you in this chart the importance of where this rejection will take place, right?"
"566210","568710"," So I want you to see where you are coming in this morning here."
"569030","570550"," You'll see just slightly above us, right?"
"570870","575230"," This has been a point of contention here once, twice, and this would be the third time."
"575590","579390"," So let's say we green-barred up off the bell and we automatically reject. "
"579990","586610"," You're looking at a drop down to this 4400 level, and then even deeper down to this 43, I think"
"586610","588390"," they called it at 43,99."
"588390","592290"," I think it's slightly lower down here, more like 43,90."
"592850","595790"," And then just on a larger scale, right?"
"596170","602250"," If we ended breaking through this support, this channel that we're in right here, we ended breaking"
"602250","603150"," through this channel. "
"603470","608610"," Basically, if we break below this 43,92, you are going to be targeting much lower levels, probably"
"608610","612670"," more than likely a retest of back before around this 420 level."
"612810","613790"," You can remember we came down here."
"614450","617850"," You can show it to you on a smaller and a larger timeframe here. "
"620820","625500"," I want you to see the danger that lies down below, okay?"
"626280","632800"," On a larger scale, how deep this could trade if we end up breaking out of this channel."
"632920","633780"," So we break through here."
"633860","637440"," We don't want to be breaking through this bottom channel here that we're trading in. "
"638020","639320"," We make it not look so severe."
"640540","642320"," It's going to help in this way."
"643380","645820"," Okay, so I'll make this one a little bit thicker here. "
"657540","663040"," I just wanted to see that this ability for us to trade up and reject, and then start to begin"
"663040","664940"," to trade down into these support levels."
"672030","673130"," We'll wait for my partner."
"678230","681390"," Now on the bull case, right, we can drive this up higher, right?"
"682130","687070"," There's a huge volatility zone here at this 4520, 4440. "
"687490","691410"," I'm getting a contact from you all in New York City to come in here on your mobile."
"694010","698390"," And in reality, you've got them calling for 4552, and that's right here."
"698570","701850"," This line right here, I'm showing you, we turn it yellow. "
"712650","716570"," I just want to show you this zone of volatility right here."
"716650","721050"," Now critical it is to not take a long until we trade above this."
"721670","725410"," We'll call it a 45, almost 4550. "
"726770","729690"," We're giving it a little bit closer for you to see."
"735070","739230"," It's almost a don't take a trade day until you're above this number here."
"739270","741810"," You're pretty much above this 4551. "
"742410","743810"," I don't think I'm going to take a trade."
"744410","748790"," You could straddle this, I guess, or move lower or move higher from here."
"749450","755670"," But if you're directionally trading this market, there really is no room off the bell today. "
"755670","762430"," And in all honesty, unless you're above even this resistance point here, you can't get bullish."
"763010","766430"," If we trade above and start to trade sideways, it's all neutral here."
"766910","769790"," I have to trade above this to start to take this bullish stance. "
"770470","774490"," So I'd be careful off the bell this morning as we trade out of this bell."
"775090","778930"," I'm going to show you one other instance of this."
"780170","781110"," It's a little bit closer. "
"784390","785990"," This is kind of what you're looking for here."
"786630","788790"," You're seeing how we're coming up right now, right?"
"789230","793890"," This 4,500 area right here, we could go either way."
"794390","797930"," If we start to trade higher, you could trade it higher to, I guess you could trade it higher to"
"797930","799870"," 4,200. "
"800950","802150"," We'll lower this a little bit."
"803750","804890"," Excuse me, 4520."
"808310","812370"," You could trade it higher than 4,500. "
"813150","815430"," You could trade this higher and then I would get out of the trade."
"815610","821550"," We'll track this on book map this morning and see if we're able to break through and start to trade"
"821550","821790"," higher."
"823050","827650"," But you can see that there can be rejection all in this zone up above here. "
"827990","828790"," Rejection here."
"828790","835230"," And if we break through this, we can end up trading this higher to this next resistance point up"
"835230","835990"," here at 4,600."
"837030","844250"," But as of right now, until we break above 4,500, 4,500, 4,500, 5,500, I'll tag this"
"844250","844890"," one here too. "
"845870","854380"," Put one in right here, right there."
"855280","858440"," So there's a lot of traffic for us to get above here and start to trade higher."
"859080","860800"," Let me show you this on a larger scale. "
"863500","865420"," You can kind of like see here."
"866200","869580"," And this is the larger resistance that you want to be breaking through and above."
"870100","875480"," And where it actually lies in today, 4,500, 4,500, 5,500. "
"878140","879080"," I'm going to make issues."
"880700","881600"," So 4,550."
"882600","884960"," You don't want to be taking any logs until we get into this area. "
"885820","889900"," We could trade up to this area and then trade up higher, but there could be some firm rejection."
"889900","892340"," Key today is going to be watching options flow."
"892900","895860"," I'm going to read to you the rest of the spot again report this morning. "
"896460","900060"," I think that was most of it, which was don't ditto in the middle."
"903540","905920"," See if there's anything else they had this morning for us."
"912120","914960"," Yeah, there was something else important here. "
"917480","918860"," I think that here for a second."
"922500","926380"," I just asked something else about as we move into the 18th."
"947690","952650"," The BRTX bio-restorative therapy can help in the initiative phase 2 clinical trial. "
"953330","954730"," It's probably only a single act right?"
"956690","961810"," I have an ABQ once and once for a simple item dual chamber, a legal space paper and triple trial"
"961810","963290"," of about a 10-gen."
"968670","973530"," I don't know if I read this too already, but it also says last week's inter-day volatility has also"
"973530","974350"," been quite high."
"974630","980850"," The 2022 operating margin expansion on a year-to-year basis and adjusted EBITDA in line at roughly"
"980850","981830"," $1.3 billion. "
"982610","984610"," They're co-opecure, call it from their conference call."
"987150","989250"," I'm going to read this last part to you."
"990030","990730"," Maybe not. "
"999890","1003010"," The last point would be, I'm going to mute this for a minute."
"1019520","1022100"," Last week's inter-day volatility has also been quite high."
"1022320","1025280"," For example, there was a 2% difference between Friday's lows and highs. "
"1025859","1031140"," Our point here is that the current level of IV seems fairly reflective of the market environment"
"1031140","1032859"," may not carry much short-term premium."
"1033520","1036359"," This may crimp some of the extended upside VANA flows."
"1037839","1040440"," IV sold leading to dealers buying back short futures. "
"1041520","1044480"," It's also around 4,500 that we see gamma more or less neutral."
"1045980","1050840"," But it's not until 4,600 and any type of meaningful positive gamma registers."
"1051420","1054680"," This indicates that prices in or around 4,500 should remain fluid. "
"1055560","1059460"," An example being that they're prone to large directional swings."
"1060320","1065000"," The point being that we can swing way higher or way lower off the spell."
"1065160","1070040"," We could even just swing higher off the bell, big green bars, and then immediately reject to lower"
"1070040","1071740"," numbers. "

"1233330","1233650"," All right."
"1235930","1239030"," It puts Needy to shut out that from the highest, most popular montage. "
"1241250","1242050"," All right."
"1242170","1242990"," So we're going to get back to it real quick."

"1261110","1261550"," 4,500. "
"1261830","1262850"," This will be the split."
"1263050","1264810"," Are we going higher or we going lower?"
"1265690","1269670"," And then the other thing to consider is a reversal somewhere in this area to trade lower."
"1269670","1278340"," Or for us to red bar it down, grab some support, or even trade down to the previous low and"
"1278340","1279280"," then start to trade higher. "
"1281760","1283360"," Yeah, we've got CPI this week."

"1298800","1304460"," I've got some put spreads at 442 and 440, which is right down in this area here."

"1320880","1322900"," I put the geared towards OPEX. "
"1326680","1329040"," So I'm just about all the shares on Hertz."
"1330300","1332540"," I'm going to turn this up."
"1333800","1346960"," Do you"
"1346960","1353100"," guys think that we reject this morning or that we bounce and go straight up or that we just green"
"1353100","1354840"," bar straight up straight up and through. "
"1366390","1368670"," Someone just bought all the shares of Hertz."
"1376410","1379630"," Yeah, my puts are probably fucked on Peton."
"1383940","1385340"," My puts are dead. "
"1386460","1388720"," They're going to put, I think I'm going to hold them though."
"1394060","1395520"," Lots of mergers right now."
"1399060","1402400"," That's what I'm noticing lots of mergers lots of panic before. "
"1403780","1405020"," Before we get to."
"1406480","1407460"," Company earnings."
"1407460","1412640"," I wonder if we have a multitude of earning or mergers as the weeks progress. "
"1416670","1422390"," I'm getting a little concerned with the number of mergers or even just rumors of mergers."
"1439060","1443000"," It makes me concerned for small mid caps as they start to report."
"1452670","1454690"," Probably green bars because it makes the least sense. "
"1455410","1459890"," Yeah, I'm probably not taking a trade right off the bell this morning."
"1463090","1464630"," I saw a pelt on display."
"1465470","1475040"," Look at Hertz before we open. "
"1509990","1513110"," I'm just going to get my stuff all set up here."

"1563470","1564390"," There's the louder."
"1566490","1576170"," One confirming the awarding of any time for being forming a microphone array systems."
"1576170","1577170"," I"
"1577170","1592470"," think that"
"1592470","1599730"," this is going to be the season of mergers and acquisitions as we get closer to earnings reports for"
"1599730","1600150"," these companies. "
"1600690","1606150"," Do you think that the idea that so many companies are, we've already got two, right, two to three"
"1606150","1606470"," announcements?"
"1606470","1612870"," Do you guys think there's a chance that it's a sign of bad earnings coming for small mid-caps?"
"1653850","1655410"," Can you guys not hear me?"
"1656730","1668060"," Can't hear the news barely at all, right, hold on, let's see"
"1668060","1676000"," if this helps, it gets too wonky let me know, can you guys hear it?"
"1686270","1688830"," You can just be a hammer at companies that just hold on."
"1731200","1732780"," So we're trading Hertz today, huh?"
"1734020","1735220"," I think it's heard about that."
"1764670","1766010"," Good morning, Emerson, how are you?"
"1788920","1790060"," We're pretty nice. "
"1802920","1812540"," I've barely heard the partner again, I don't know where that is, I'm trying to get cranked up right"
"1812540","1812740"," now."
"1812880","1823470"," Tell me how this works, all right, this"
"1823470","1824310"," might be on blast."
"1824310","1830470"," So if I blow out your speakers, I apologize, we'll turn it down a moment. "
"1835980","1842680"," Good morning, King, good morning, Spencer, good morning, PE, the CO, good to CHP."
"1862440","1870440"," I am the spinoff from Zimmer Biomett, fighting initial fiscal 22 outlook."
"1874620","1875560"," How was that one?"
"1876320","1876800"," Is that too loud?"
"1881020","1886760"," For ZIMB, C, 2022, revenue, at about a billion dollars flat. "
"1887360","1890960"," Good morning, Matthew, good morning, Johnny, let me know if that was loud enough."
"1893000","1894000"," Better on the news volume?"
"1899280","1899720"," Perfect."
"1926170","1926810"," What do I have?"
"1926910","1929630"," I'm looking through my account right now to see what I've got kicking around. "
"1933350","1936410"," XMTR is ommetry announcing a new cloud-based software to help managers."

"1988520","1991800"," Take note that XPI is looking strong this morning."
"1991800","2000740"," It looks like it made a reversal on the open on Friday,"
"2000740","2011110"," looking somewhat"
"2011110","2011530"," bullish. "
"2012230","2014970"," Lots of biotech reporting coming up."
"2026900","2027800"," Is that better?"
"2030190","2031250"," Right on, right on."
"2032590","2033830"," Daphne and Robert, how are you?"
"2049260","2060199"," Well, like, Peton reminds me of, Peton reminds me of Nikola to"
"2060199","2064840"," some extent, but also you got to figure that there are some major stakeholders in Peton. "
"2066380","2070420"," So I'm sure they're having lots of meetings and then they can't come into their earnings report."
"2070679","2071739"," They have nothing good they're going to say."
"2072540","2075980"," So the best thing they could say would be we're going to sell, right, or merge. "
"2078460","2079280"," Sell the badge."
"2080040","2081600"," And so it pumps the stock."
"2081840","2085600"," Doesn't matter if there is actually a suitor or not. "
"2089159","2093260"," It's a way for large stakeholders to sell out of their positions."
"2095300","2099620"," It does bring me to pause though, especially with the merger with Frontier."
"2099840","2100960"," I think it's Frontier and Spirit. "
"2103520","2106160"," But how many companies will be attempting these moves?"
"2106160","2110540"," The County Press reporting that the Montepashi board has withdrawn the powers of its CEO,"
"2110720","2111300"," Bastionini."
"2120840","2122160"," Yeah, and Winky, do you think it pops?"
"2122680","2123780"," Do you think XBI pops?"
"2135060","2138500"," Or he just keeps trading down into the depths of hell?"
"2149750","2150650"," You're in South Africa."
"2158220","2159520"," Yeah, I don't think Peton survives. "
"2159920","2162080"," And I don't think they're the only company that doesn't survive either."
"2164600","2171120"," I think they're a prime example of growth companies that have, you know, worked on their future or"
"2171120","2171580"," have not."
"2172960","2174300"," There were a lot of puts. "
"2174620","2183880"," There was many millions of puts taken out on IWM last week down to 192."
"2184900","2187900"," And I think it has to do with the expectation."
"2190160","2191200"," We're going to take a look real quick. "
"2194040","2196540"," That a lot of these companies aren't going to have a good answer."
"2198680","2210590"," You know, it reminds me of, there was a trade, there was a big trade on, I want"
"2210590","2216570"," to say it was on the, the original protests that were done."
"2217270","2221270"," So there were all these like a police trades and gun trades and stuff. "
"2222430","2224410"," And a lot of hype put into some companies."
"2225370","2228350"," And they finally came out and said we're not going to do anything right in there."
"2228450","2229970"," The hype stocks crashed. "
"2231390","2241390"," So last week we had like 318, 189 P, this is all IWM, 225, 190 P,"
"2241990","2243490"," like $5 million."
"2245330","2254630"," Lots of smaller trades all focused around February 11th, February 25th."
"2256990","2263190"," And a little bit as well in March for IWM. "
"2263770","2269990"," I think that's the one concern we have in the background is that a lot of these small mid caps"
"2269990","2275590"," might come to the table and say we've got no good guidance and we have pissed away all of our"
"2275590","2275870"," money."
"2284640","2285820"," Yeah, DGLY Billy."
"2286820","2287680"," That was one of them. "
"2287760","2294680"," Do you remember DGLY was pumped up and then it ended up getting trashed."
"2296320","2318500"," I wonder"
"2318500","2321140"," if there's a rejection on XPI today or if it gets pumped."
"2326580","2331180"," But XPI was at 100 and it was it was stupid. "
"2331340","2332240"," I at one point wasn't it?"
"2334080","2339700"," 174, 79, it's now down to $83 plus half its value."
"2347100","2351140"," Yeah, it's at a key resistance coming right off the bell at 91, 16."
"2360900","2362240"," Yeah, DGLY was one of them. "
"2362460","2363340"," There's a whole bunch of them though."
"2364540","2365420"," Good morning Brad."
"2365580","2365780"," How are you?"
"2365780","2366740"," How was your weekend?"
"2390850","2392470"," It's at 91 right now in XPI. "
"2394850","2396010"," Yeah, it's at 90, 79."
"2396590","2397450"," Oh yeah, it's right up there."
"2398050","2399710"," I didn't even see the green, the little green. "
"2399870","2404610"," It didn't wipe my screen this morning."
"2406370","2408730"," I didn't see the last two little green bars down there."
"2410410","2411770"," It's right there right now, right?"
"2415300","2416680"," I'm looking at it right now, bro. "
"2420630","2422910"," It's looking kind of, looking kind of squeezy."
"2437590","2438850"," That's those in the 80s."
"2440030","2440710"," Right now, Brad. "
"2441530","2443990"," Yeah, Winky, you think XPI blasts off today or no?"
"2445750","2471820"," Yeah, look"
"2471820","2472540"," at Hertz too."
"2483280","2485560"," Someone did buy all the Hertz this morning, didn't they?"
"2512570","2532700"," Yeah, I thought I figured 95, 96, three"
"2532700","2533800"," and a half minutes until the bell."

"2598980","2600800"," Really buy it in 89 and then reverse. "

"2666880","2673900"," Good morning, everybody."
"2675060","2676100"," I'm bullish on the day. "
"2678980","2682220"," I would really like to see us trade down and then up."
"2683260","2687420"," Unless we green bar it melt straight up to a larger resistance."
"2689970","2692170"," I don't like the idea of getting trapped right off the bell. "
"2693690","2708940"," I would have 45.20, 45.50. But"
"2708940","2711400"," I'm looking to go along today if you want to know."
"2712780","2720260"," I'd really like to see us do a red bar down off the open and then trade higher."

"4427720","4431000"," I'm watching Tesla right now."
"4431040","4434920"," And so my one fear is that it got pumped to 950. "
"4437360","4439100"," You know, that's where all the sellers are."
"4439360","4442040"," So if there's a place where we dump today."
"4448360","4451400"," It's going to be, you can see me. "
"4451480","4453320"," Tesla's pretty much the proving around, right?"
"4455460","4457920"," Tesla has been able to give it 950 for a minute."
"4459780","4462040"," The whole trade in Tesla has been by it."
"4462080","4465600"," 80 and sell it at 9.35 to 950. "
"4466660","4469100"," So it's definitely at the upper end of its trading range."
"4477590","4479310"," Yeah, pizza and puts is the play."
"4482560","4485440"," So she was a clock with seconds and minutes on it. "

"4511200","4512720"," I'm long on spy right now."
"4515160","4517580"," Everything smells like a trap for bulls."
"4518540","4519960"," I mean, it's honest. "
"4519960","4524320"," These sellers are getting pretty ruthless down here."
"4525180","4527220"," But I'm watching like Tesla bulls are stepping up."
"4527360","4529580"," I'm watching calls coming in Tesla right now. "

"4573600","4576260"," Yeah, if there's a failure here right now, Mero."
"4578260","4583740"," You know, a swing below this 450 is super contentious in here. "
"4584100","4588580"," If we swing below 450, we get we can get a 1.3% move down."
"4589540","4590220"," That's pretty ugly."
"4591420","4592480"," Much easier a little bit. "
"4626400","4628340"," Yeah, 440, 445."
"4643730","4646970"," I've got I've got a depth of help put on puts on right now."

"4660610","4661690"," I'm a little concerned."
"4661690","4663970"," So my biggest concern right now. "
"4664990","4671330"," Is my biggest concern right now is like they took Tesla right to resistance off the bell."
"4671990","4677090"," I don't like seeing like if if Tesla was starting out today like 880."
"4679070","4681190"," I'd be like, yeah, we're going way up. "
"4681910","4683470"," We've got the sellers are hiding."
"4684250","4686770"," We all know between 935 and 950."
"4688830","4693390"," I don't like that the sellers came so low right off the bell on spy. "
"4693770","4699630"," I don't like they drove Tesla right to 950 right off the bell."
"4699910","4701870"," It's almost like a set up to sell the market."
"4708830","4709830"," Yeah, you can't. "
"4714320","4714800"," Yeah."
"4716500","4718400"," It's by flex is saying the 10 years flying."
"4727410","4729270"," And the flow is weird this morning too. "
"4729410","4730970"," There isn't a ton of flow."
"4732390","4733390"," There isn't a ton."

"4752130","4752570"," Right."
"4752690","4753930"," It was done better off the bell."
"4773280","4775100"," There's just be conscience right now. "
"4775260","4777060"," Do you guys see the hero indicators just?"
"4781880","4784660"," The hero indicators getting pretty negative."

"4799160","4802260"," Now on a smaller time frame, it doesn't mean as much."

"4809980","4810540"," Three, four hours. "
"4810760","4812540"," If we continue to see this stay negative."
"4812540","4820680"," It can lead to negativity later in the day time."
"4822880","4825560"," Not always, but be conscious of it. "
"4825700","4826860"," That is what the point of it is."
"4827120","4827880"," That it's an accumulative."
"4831460","4833700"," You're accumulating more and more and more puts. "
"4835320","4836940"," Even if they're not showing up anywhere."
"4837380","4842520"," If you're not seeing them."
"4845060","4849060"," So I should probably look it up on a raw flow or a lot. "
"4849400","4849500"," Yeah."
"4849680","4850700"," We look at raw flow."
"4852280","4862220"," And the options chains aren't showing much in"
"4862220","4863340"," terms of today either. "
"4925070","4925630"," Between."
"4930430","4941310"," We have"
"4941310","4943430"," some split stuff on TLT calls and puts."
"4947690","4949690"," Puts on IWM once they hit 200. "
"4950310","4952170"," And then the spy I'm seeing some puts."
"4953330","4956630"," But only like 932 and 938."
"4957490","4959350"," This morning right off the bell. "
"4971610","4973830"," 345 P on the spy."
"4974450","4975550"," 3,900 contracts."
"4976970","4979030"," Spiring on February 28. "
"4981110","4981510"," And then."
"4983130","4984510"," 445 P expiring."
"4985970","4986930"," February 9."
"4991550","4993050"," 6,700 contracts. "
"4998020","5000080"," Makes me want to forget pinned here for a little bit."
"5005470","5006130"," Hey, double."
"5006250","5006930"," I hope you had a great weekend. "
"5010850","5013790"," Josh is like it's going to trade sideways for the next year."
"5015270","5017610"," We were just dumping already."
"5021200","5023060"," Yeah, there's some concern right now. "
"5025700","5026960"," There is some concern."
"5027240","5027940"," I don't like."
"5028160","5031200"," I don't like where they traded a Tesla to. "
"5032980","5034420"," We'll look up Tesla again."
"5035420","5037440"," Tesla's done fairly well."
"5041160","5042820"," They're better than it used to. "
"5043780","5045640"," As a weather for the market."
"5046620","5049140"," Let that load up in the background and see what's happening."
"5052940","5054780"," And the sellers have come down and force. "
"5057100","5058440"," In force down here."
"5059680","5062020"," 4,500, 61, 450, 61."
"5063260","5064280"," 4,500, 61. "
"5084940","5086440"," Yeah, the other thing too is."
"5090550","5093710"," The other thing that I noticed was I noticed Twitter is all on board."
"5093710","5097090"," The sideways volatility trade and then this morning. "
"5097750","5101190"," I was catching up at like 4, 5 this morning."
"5101730","5103570"," I was listening to CNBC."
"5105150","5107710"," And they're talking about the volatility trade today. "
"5108950","5109530"," So my next."
"5109850","5111890"," My other fear this morning is."
"5113210","5117390"," You know, if CNBC is starting to talk about the volatility trade, the sideways trade. "
"5118930","5121190"," Is it too many people that know about it now?"
"5135900","5137300"," Thanks for the heads up on the Tesla news."
"5145770","5148250"," Yeah, we need some news to drive the market without a doubt."
"5177550","5180270"," It's a really sketchy place like 4,500 is. "
"5181130","5181550"," Danger."
"5186260","5188920"," It's pure, pure danger for bulls and bears."
"5189120","5191720"," There's no real bias on either side. "
"5193180","5195580"," Watching some puts come in on plug."
"5196000","5196480"," Facebook."
"5197920","5199640"," Facebook, February 11th 220 P."
"5200580","5203240"," $181,000, $213,000. "
"5204200","5205360"," More Facebook puts."
"5207080","5208560"," Like a whole mixed bag."
"5208780","5214020"," Netflix calls March 18, 425 C, $700,000. "
"5214620","5215440"," Totally mixed bag here."
"5216960","5218160"," BA calls."
"5219520","5223860"," I'll go score February 25th 230 C, $58,000. "
"5224800","5229920"," And I've got Apple calls February 18th, 172.5 C, $194,000."
"5241460","5242560"," Really mixed bag this morning."
"5244660","5246540"," Calls puts all over the place. "
"5253300","5256100"," Watching bulls diving on calls."
"5256740","5258020"," Bears diving on puts."
"5264190","5265650"," And yet a movement so far. "
"5265930","5279550"," We got a movement of 44820 to 450.41. No,"
"5279670","5280590"," snap a line down here."
"5285920","5297900"," And we'll"
"5297900","5301400"," look at an ES chart real quick and see what it looks like."
"5304660","5309500"," I have ES, I'll show you a better picture of what is actually going on. "
"5320870","5323670"," In one way or another, we're going to get some resolution here."
"5325830","5330390"," By roughly the end of day, we're going to get some resolution."
"5331410","5333730"," In one way or another, we're getting resolution today. "
"5335170","5344380"," So it seems we will have resolution for both sides."
"5344380","5345240"," At some point today."
"5348220","5350440"," We're going to drive straight into resistance. "
"5365760","5366780"," And just heads up."
"5367260","5373220"," So just as a heads up here, we had a wave of sellers come step in this morning."
"5373220","5374320"," We're at the bell, right?"
"5374840","5375880"," A lot of the big caps. "
"5377100","5378260"," This is good to see."
"5379120","5380600"," I want to say our Google."
"5380600","5381340"," Google. "
"5382600","5387540"," February 18th, 2700C, $4.4 million."
"5389380","5395860"," Disney calls, February 18th, 150C, almost $600,000."
"5397500","5402510"," The real mixed bag right now. "
"5461940","5463820"," Romeo Delta Hotel Lima."
"5489040","5490520"," I think time for a second to make some trades."
"5528150","5531230"," Lots of VA calls coming in just heads up all morning long. "
"5531990","5534670"," Just VA calls, streaming in all morning long."
"5535570","5539550"," Yeah, don't like Tesla being this like Tesla's just floating around down there."
"5540030","5541050"," Just below VWAP. "
"5541770","5546270"," Some VIX calls coming in VXX, February 11th, 21C."
"5547690","5554270"," VA calls, February 11th, 210C, three sweeps, about $150,000 each."
"5559170","5561630"," It's a really wonky place for the market right now. "
"5567410","5573570"," And then it looks like you've got bears buying puts at $450, and then bulls buying calls at $4.48 "
"5573570","5578710",".50. You know, $2 spread."
"5579770","5580930"," It's kind of crazy."
"5586620","5588160"," Yeah, it's really messy right now. "
"5594350","5595630"," Thanks for the heads up, Chas."
"5599320","5600220"," Yeah, it's not that."
"5600380","5603340"," It's just the placement of where everything is right now is just wonky. "
"5603340","5609160"," You would have liked to have seen Tesla open at like $880, $900, and then trade up to $950 to"
"5609160","5610080"," break through sellers."
"5612840","5620080"," So when you're seeing these, all these tickers that hold up the spy opening, right off the bell,"
"5620280","5621280"," just green bars higher."
"5623340","5624220"," It's not good. "
"5624620","5628640"," You want to see Tesla open lower or at least see a squeeze."
"5630020","5632180"," We didn't see sellers right off of."
"5632920","5635080"," Yeah, now we're coming back down and Tesla here. "
"5635620","5640900"," We are trading lower than VWAP, but all the day traders know to pick it up between $880 and $900."
"5641480","5642540"," No offense, right?"
"5642740","5647140"," You kind of need big news to push Tesla higher through this resistance of $950."
"5647540","5653500"," Otherwise, it's going to drift lower until it finds support, which right now currently is at $900. "
"5661440","5662660"," The one good thing."
"5663320","5665500"," I've seen one now watching some spy calls come in."
"5666500","5671980"," It's about February 7th, 449 C for $170,000. "
"5672120","5676380"," Spy calls again for 52 C, $98,000."
"5677840","5680520"," It's all kind of wonky flow without a doubt."
"5682740","5686500"," You can see the support stepping in right now on. "
"5687420","5691240"," I think Emerson brought up for 4850 as being key support."
"5694220","5695240"," More VIX calls."
"5695540","5696320"," I mean, this is really bizarre. "
"5701260","5702860"," Yeah, it does feel like a Monday and summer."
"5708680","5711700"," Yeah, I'm watching a lot of energy calls come in."
"5711860","5713540"," Dip buyers on energy right now. "
"5715540","5718820"," I didn't want to say anything about it because it's still a little bit dangerous."
"5724840","5726980"," It did knife straight back up, didn't it?"
"5727120","5727360"," Jesus."
"5728180","5730880"," Any dip in energy just buying, huh?"
"5732200","5734380"," Any and every dip in energy gets bought. "
"5737000","5738180"," It's cranking."
"5738560","5739840"," XOM is just cranking."
"5745300","5750440"," The data sector general say they're considering their longer-term military posture in Eastern"
"5750440","5752780"," Europe to strengthen deterrence. "
"5757680","5759380"," Spy's looking a little drunk right now."
"5760200","5763650"," A little droopy."
"5766370","5768070"," So you didn't see a price target below. "
"5768390","5768750"," It breaks."
"5770210","5773360"," I mean, just look at that."
"5773580","5776760"," It's just a wall of support, wall of resistance. "
"5777720","5779320"," I mean, look at this here to here."
"5781800","5789060"," 45061 break below 448.42. This is just straight down."
"5794680","5796420"," Probably that 444 number. "
"5798840","5799480"," It looks even lower."
"5803100","5804220"," It breaks 444."
"5810330","5819760"," Next stop is actually 441 and supports at 440. "
"5834240","5843280"," You know, it can shoot this range all day long today, but the key to this is you're going to"
"5843280","5844980"," see resolution one way or another."
"5845100","5848440"," It's a severe resolution before end of day today."
"5848440","5850640"," Or it looks like that on the futures chart. "
"5851180","5861000"," It looks on the futures chart, like, figure, recall it at being literally 3 p.m., 4 p.m. You're"
"5861000","5864300"," going to see a huge move in either direction."
"5866740","5872320"," SQQQ calls February 11th, 38C for $346,000."
"5872860","5879620"," QQQ calls February 7th, 360C for $132,000. "
"5879800","5881220"," Paypal calls still coming in."
"5881240","5882660"," They're starting to stack up right now, too."
"5883160","5884680"," More BA calls coming in. "
"5885620","5889880"," I think BA is going to have the most calls."
"5893520","5897360"," It's the end of one is Google, Tesla, then the spy."
"5902380","5906980"," KVH, then AMD, but the number of calls, they've got six orders on BA. "
"5907920","5911660"," Six orders on Tesla, nine orders on spy calls."
"5913100","5914560"," We should get some resolution."
"5915640","5917420"," It should be before the end of today, right?"
"5917900","5918880"," If we reject. "
"5921400","5923380"," It's going to happen today, I think."
"5924680","5931480"," I doubt that we just plow right through this downward channel and not find some resolution today at"
"5931480","5931940"," some point."
"5943500","5945900"," I guess it depends on which chart you're looking at. "
"5946560","5950740"," I guess the farther down we go, the more time we have to go up."
"5952640","5960240"," If we maintain this 4,500, we're going to get some resolution right around 4 p.m., surprisingly,"
"5961400","5961960"," shocker."
"5981880","5990290"," The axle he's been banging. "
"5992910","5993750"," Banging."
"5995830","5998350"," Any negative news just gets bought."
"6006050","6008390"," The spy just keeps ricocheting off of 448. "
"6009830","6043920"," And a half and looks like just below this 450.51. So"
"6043920","6046740"," I ended up getting a nice pair of monitor headphones."
"6048680","6050100"," I can listen to you guys."
"6050860","6051960"," I can't speak too loud. "
"6053320","6054200"," I'm going to have to return them."
"6055040","6057220"," I need a volume control on the headset."
"6061260","6062480"," I can kind of piss stuff about it. "
"6070300","6071640"," Yeah, you know what else, Winky?"
"6072060","6081760"," So last night I was listening to people say, you know, Bitcoin is leading the indexes, and that's"
"6081760","6082820"," just not true."
"6083120","6083920"," This doesn't happen."
"6084980","6089580"," Sometimes it shows, it trades with the indexes or leads the indexes, but it's not. "
"6091740","6094140"," It's not enough for me to be claiming."
"6101540","6104020"," Hey, pros and cons on XLE and XOP."
"6104340","6104960"," Buy every dip. "
"6108710","6110350"," That's truly the only thing I can tell you."
"6111070","6113170"," Buy every single dip on anything in energy."
"6117730","6118970"," Yeah, crypto's been weird. "
"6119590","6122790"," It looks like it's correlating with the markets, but it really isn't."
"6123310","6124530"," I don't think that it is."
"6126550","6129190"," It's like correlating, but it's not correlated to the markets. "
"6130250","6131210"," Very dangerous."
"6137690","6138730"," Astro A40s."
"6139090","6146940"," A little pissy that what I just bought. "
"6158390","6159170"," Yeah, so."
"6164420","6167760"," Yes, I wasn't listening in early or say I wasn't listening."
"6168140","6169980"," I wasn't monitoring the broadcast before. "
"6171180","6172160"," So I didn't have to wear headphones."
"6173860","6176100"," And then once I started playing the."
"6178940","6180160"," Once I started playing. "
"6182700","6187160"," The boy Charlie, whoever he is, I wanted to be able to hear what he had to say."
"6189360","6193140"," We asked about Corsair Astro A40s."
"6194320","6197540"," Well, that was Corsair. "
"6202850","6203410"," Xt."
"6220460","6223420"," Yeah, I mean, I get the idea behind correlating."
"6223660","6224880"," It doesn't get vanarralis. "
"6225300","6229660"," What I don't like about crypto is that it tends to trade."
"6232040","6234980"," For me, I find that crypto tends to trade."
"6237560","6239900"," More in line with classic charting. "
"6241800","6244100"," Because they have nothing else to base it off of."
"6244700","6250120"," So it doesn't have as much of the randomness that the markets have."
"6254010","6256990"," So like I trust it, but then you can't trust it. "
"6257430","6260410"," Like there's nothing you can't really trust it against the market."
"6269650","6271350"," Hyper X clouds."
"6276290","6277630"," I don't really need anything. "
"6278530","6280370"," Yeah, I can't use a couple of things."
"6280470","6283690"," I can't use the wireless because it sucks."
"6285410","6288070"," It sucks my processor. "
"6290170","6294830"," I just need a wired and a nice wired set of headphones that has a volume control."
"6295150","6299410"," I might be able to buy a jack that has a volume control on it."
"6300350","6305850"," Because right now I don't have a way right now to turn my monitor volume down. "
"6307390","6311170"," Without, I don't know if I can add a new sort of, I don't know how to do it this"
"6311170","6311410"," way."
"6311930","6314550"," So I got a jack on the mic and I plug into it."
"6314550","6315550"," It's all fucked up. "
"6319160","6324120"," We just made it almost two days or two as the standard deviation moving the spine today and lower"
"6324120","6324460"," volume."

"6344100","6346260"," Or yeah, am I using voice meter right?"
"6346420","6347180"," What am I using right now?"
"6347880","6349180"," Check to see what I'm using right now. "

"7112810","7117210"," Tesla is trading from 880 to 900."
"7117610","7118770"," That's the by the dip zone. "
"7119370","7123310"," Sell the rips at 935 to 950 depending on how dirty you want to get."
"7124370","7125630"," Unless something changes."
"7127890","7128850"," That's what it is. "
"7137760","7138600"," Not really read."
"7139760","7144280"," There's been a by the dip sell the rip on Tesla for like like seven trading sessions."
"7144960","7146140"," Six seven trading sessions. "
"7147880","7158980"," And the sucky part is the shitty part is that to get above 950 you need some news or or"
"7158980","7166340"," if you have repetitive if you have repetitive general good market news, we would trade higher than"
"7166340","7166740"," 950."
"7167600","7170400"," Otherwise it's just buying the dip down below it."
"7171260","7172680"," Today it's actually at 900. "
"7176500","7178720"," Is the by the dip on Tesla today."
"7179900","7181200"," Yeah, boiler room."
"7181640","7183060"," Spy's trading like a boiler room today. "
"7183620","7185480"," Spy's trading like a $1 ticker."
"7188120","7188720"," Absolutely."
"7189560","7190160"," 100%. "
"7190920","7197120"," But one, two, three, four technically we're on the fourth hit by."
"7197500","7199120"," Or I guess you call it a little bit more."
"7201380","7202900"," Just a straight grinds today. "
"7206680","7207040"," Absolutely."
"7210140","7211360"," You guys want to see it?"
"7211480","7212280"," Do you guys want to see it?"
"7212400","7213620"," Do you guys want to show you the Tesla chart?"
"7213880","7215180"," I brought it up here a couple times today."
"7215680","7216500"," We look right at it. "
"7217020","7217700"," See where it's at."
"7218520","7219080"," We got it again."
"7219880","7220420"," I don't know. "
"7221120","7222080"," Take a snapshot or something."
"7226160","7227260"," It's a kind of brutal."
"7230940","7233180"," Yeah, more spy puts coming in right now. "
"7233600","7237160"," We have a three-way split on spy puts."
"7237380","7238060"," 46 feet."
"7238200","7238520"," Oh, look at it. "
"7238620","7239560"," For comments."
"7240580","7241320"," Some east-facing guard."
"7244060","7251680"," We've got a two more split and a sweep for another three or $350,000 in spy February 7th, 451"
"7251680","7252100"," P."
"7252980","7261390"," Very dangerous right now trading the spy unless you're in and out. "
"7261390","7263730"," Yeah, Johnny Rob here comes the spy rug pull."
"7276400","7278860"," It's Tesla's making EV tanks for the Ukraine Reservoir."
"7280880","7282200"," I'm going to take a look at it right now. "
"7282740","7283100"," I got the book."
"7283240","7284040"," I got a load right up."
"7284080","7284820"," I'm bugging out right now. "
"7290270","7291070"," Almost loaded."
"7292410","7293230"," We'll come back to Tesla."
"7295210","7297170"," Looks like at 9.18. There were some support. "
"7316360","7318940"," I don't like this negative hero indicator on the spy."
"7320080","7322820"," Although it's not showing itself anywhere else in the market."
"7329040","7331080"," I don't know what's from selling puts right now. "
"7331540","7331860"," Possibly."
"7361780","7362420"," Let's see."
"7362520","7362780"," We'll listen. "
"7364900","7366640"," This would be key for guards."
"7367720","7368280"," Comments."
"7369300","7370700"," If you give a hearing of them. "
"7377480","7378340"," More spy puts."
"7378340","7378660"," That's interesting."
"7378980","7380900"," The bottlenecks will still persist for some times. "
"7381200","7386120"," They're signs that they may be starting."
"7387500","7395380"," I think their explanation is likely to remain hot."
"7400180","7406340"," These ones they continue to see the risk of the economic outlook is broadly balanced over the"
"7406340","7406800"," medium term. "
"7407440","7410320"," It's the economy to pick up strongly later this year."
"7413750","7414790"," He's breaking up for me too."
"7416150","7425900"," The guards saying energy prices continue to be the main reason for the elevated rate of"
"7425900","7426220"," inflation. "
"7432700","7435800"," Food prices also increase owing to seasonal factors."
"7439130","7446090"," In addition, price rises have become more widespread with the price of large number of goods and"
"7446090","7447990"," services having increased markedly."
"7456620","7458540"," The guards taking a shit on the markets right now. "
"7471450","7474910"," The guards saying risk to inflation outlook are tilted to the upside."
"7475830","7480790"," And the past surges in energy prices weaken the spending power of households and reduced inflation"
"7480790","7482070"," over the medium term."
"7483610","7487130"," Now, so this isn't the way we don't pick up our trade at 9.19, but I want you guys"
"7487130","7492550"," to be clear out there, okay, that the real money is down at 900 on Tesla. "
"7492550","7499130"," So it doesn't mean we don't trade up at 9.20. That's in there next meeting up."
"7500570","7501570"," But we do tend."
"7501850","7502550"," We do tend. "
"7502830","7505190"," We mostly see this right as this comes in right here."
"7505290","7506170"," The support down here."
"7506350","7512890"," They'll carefully examine how higher energy prices will transmit through the economy and affect the"
"7512890","7513950"," outlook overall. "
"7515850","7521430"," That doesn't mean we don't start at 9.20 here, but point being that the smart money is down below"
"7521430","7521690"," 9."
"7521930","7525190"," The guards saying that they'll have to bear in mind that the demand conditions in the euro area do"
"7525190","7530170"," not show the same signs of overheating that can be observed in other major economies."
"7532800","7540540"," That is when you guys are looking at Walter Bloomberg, this is where he gets his news from."
"7543200","7549320"," We are saying that the state of the Eurozone economy increases likelihood that the current price"
"7549320","7552220"," pressures will be will subside before becoming entrenched. "
"7560180","7564020"," This is the fastest news you can get, faster than anything on Twitter."
"7577240","7580100"," Yeah, it's kind of weird seeing the Polish FM quit."
"7580760","7586600"," The guard affirming there's a defined sequence between the end of that asset purchases in lift off"
"7586600","7586880"," date. "
"7587220","7592080"," This is a rate hike will not occur before that asset purchases finish."
"7594660","7595760"," Run shit in the bed."
"7599880","7601340"," I hate trading stocks. "
"7602540","7604160"," Makes me want to puke every day."
"7604780","7606640"," Sit in a play for like a month."
"7607360","7609920"," I can't believe I can't believe I even bought that shit. "
"7612880","7615830"," I'm on Tesla right now."
"7616750","7617950"," So this is the same thing on Tesla."
"7618090","7622550"," It doesn't mean we don't get a buy here on Tesla at 9.18. The smart money is down here"
"7622550","7623050"," at 900. "
"7623750","7624710"," So what's the safe play?"
"7625010","7625970"," Safe play is picking up at 900."
"7626630","7628350"," At least today it was at 880 last week."
"7629050","7633230"," Safe play right now is to pick up at 900, ride it up to nine, which is this is better"
"7633230","7636810"," in some respects because we had lots of sellers last week at 935. "
"7637370","7638530"," Lots of traffic up here."
"7638850","7641150"," Looks like the sellers have moved higher at 945, 950."
"7642170","7644890"," You're going to be looking for a buy down below here at 900, right?"
"7645510","7647110"," Take it from 900 to 950. "
"7648170","7648990"," Trade that up."
"7649270","7653690"," There is some support down here at 910 and there were some buyers in 915."
"7654290","7655470"," I'll give you all that down here. "
"7655610","7657150"," Yes, there is some support down here."
"7658490","7662170"," As we can trade higher from here up to see."
"7663470","7664790"," It's still at 950. "
"7665670","7668130"," It's called at 944, 13."
"7668850","7673810"," When you guys take risky trades, if you're down 20 bucks on this trade and you're like, shit my"
"7673810","7674370"," shit's burning."
"7675090","7681850"," If you were to more frequently look for the dip buy, wherever that big dip buy is, let's say you"
"7681850","7689630"," just passed, let's say if you traded this 10 times, three to five out of the times you buy here,"
"7689870","7692150"," you're going to lose out of your 10 trades. "
"7692370","7697030"," If you wait for this every time, you're more than likely going to win most of those trades."
"7710610","7711870"," I'm just bouncing around right now."
"7719250","7720370"," My right now is brutal. "
"7724050","7725030"," Yeah, I don't know why."
"7725210","7727070"," Their audio service is usually pretty good."
"7727210","7729250"," Today it's been really shitty, isn't it, Desperado?"
"7730490","7732050"," I'm not really impressed today. "
"7733250","7735190"," It's saying that I have a great connection."
"7736630","7741310"," It's got a little connection button on there showing that I've got a almost real time imperceptible"
"7741310","7741750"," quality."
"7744810","7746670"," Maybe I can say that sucks today. "
"7753330","7754890"," So I'll read it off to you guys, okay?"
"7755150","7758810"," So the ECB chief Lagarde is saying that bottlenecks will persist."
"7759130","7762530"," They'll persist for some time, but there are some signs that they may be starting to ease."
"7764090","7766050"," Basically inflation is transitory, right?"
"7766290","7767450"," Shortages are transitory. "
"7768630","7771510"," Pandemic, herbs, hurt growth to start off the year."
"7771510","7775130"," Supply squeezes energy, damp activity and near-term."
"7776370","7779130"," Economy is to pick up strongly later this year. "
"7779510","7781210"," Price rises have become more widespread."
"7782030","7784750"," Risks to growth broadly balanced over medium-term."
"7785750","7788910"," Risks to inflation are tiled to the upside. "
"7790770","7795070"," The past surges in energy prices squeak into the spending power of households and reduced inflation"
"7795070","7795990"," over the medium-term."
"7796850","7797490"," We know all this."
"7799230","7804010"," We have to bear in mind that demand conditions in the euro area do not show the same signs of"
"7804010","7804630"," overheating. "
"7805730","7808530"," That could be observed in other major economies."
"7809630","7810050"," Oh, I don't know."
"7810250","7811790"," I would disagree with that right now. "
"7812550","7816650"," Red rates that ECB won't hike rates before net bond buying ends."
"7817130","7818510"," Any policy adjustment will be gradual."
"7820250","7821270"," Similar to the US. "
"7827870","7830210"," Yeah, no hikes before the end of QE in EU."
"7832370","7833830"," We look at AMPH."
"7835990","7838550"," Yeah, it's a very clear trading strategy on Tesla. "
"7839310","7843470"," It doesn't, you know, you might be like, oh, I missed that trade because they bought it at 9.20."
"7844070","7852070"," The reality is a bunch of those trades buying outside of the where the real money is is going to"
"7852070","7853990"," be a net loss for you."
"7854450","7855790"," Or you're getting caught in the middle."
"7864320","7868340"," It did bounce off 9.15.13. That's almost at 900. "
"7869340","7873000"," It's not a bad trade here for where it is on a scandal stick chart or probably take this trade."
"7874240","7877140"," But I just don't like that the buyers are lining up at 900."
"7881320","7884900"," And again, just to reiterate, had Tesla start of the day. "
"7885600","7889760"," Well, I guess it did kind of start the day closer to 900, right?"
"7891420","7898700"," It was a dip by 9.18. It immediately went to 9.50 and the market started, you know, ricocheting"
"7898700","7899540"," off the top already."
"7929020","7931700"," It looks like they're murdering options on the spy today."
"7936680","7941240"," Now, the interesting part is so phase February 7th, right?"
"7943080","7948620"," The longer right now, normally I would say the longer we trade sideways, we're going to go down. "
"7948620","7956660"," But the more that we murder puts for February 18th, the greater the chance of a huge."
"7957540","7959380"," Of an rally we have."
"7988800","7990380"," More Netflix calls. "
"7991100","7992500"," Big money on Netflix."
"7993200","7995140"," February 18th, 395 C."
"7999310","8001070"," Watching heavy headers and Netflix."
"8003670","8009170"," German Chancellor Scholz just reiterating that there will be a very high price of Russia invades"
"8009170","8009170"," Ukraine. "
"8010410","8012190"," Echoing from other native leaders."
"8033520","8039720"," An interesting trade on Netflix as it is extremely bearish looking right now."
"8041140","8051110"," Now, there's lots of by the dippers stepping in, but it's extremely bearish"
"8051110","8051550"," right now. "
"8052460","8063780"," And traded down"
"8063780","8065400"," from 413 to 398."
"8067220","8069420"," It's broken any semblance of support."
"8077020","8079300"," It's not easy to read the market right now. "
"8081000","8081920"," So Sean, big caps."
"8112190","8114150"," XPI strong all day long."
"8117110","8120770"," We discussed that ticker or that index before the open this morning. "
"8124820","8129220"," Tag 9386 sold off slightly, but then is coming back again."
"8130140","8134700"," Now trading at 9.3.33. With renewed strength."
"8143680","8145140"," More uber calls. "
"8146040","8147140"," February 11th, 40 C."
"8165280","8167480"," We might see some resolution on."
"8176180","8185140"," Intel announcing that they've formally launched their accelerator to help build an"
"8185140","8198530"," innovation ecosystem until saying"
"8198530","8204049"," a new $1 billion fund will support early stage startups and established companies in building"
"8204049","8207190"," disruptive technologies for the Foundry ecosystem."
"8235799","8237400"," With that's on Facebook. "
"8258950","8259889"," That's on Facebook."
"8260230","8260750"," That's a tough one."
"8264740","8267660"," And guessing that Facebook is heavily shorted. "
"8267660","8278870"," I see where"
"8278870","8282830"," you're looking at Facebook right now in the chart, wondering if it's going to trade higher."
"8283010","8283969"," We can look at it right now."
"8296820","8299520"," There are lots of call buyers on Facebook right now. "
"8305309","8308670"," Facebook's a tough one."
"8309049","8312790"," Under normal circumstances, I would say, of course, you buy Facebook."
"8316490","8318530"," But what is your time horizon, right?"
"8319469","8320070"," That's the big question. "
"8320070","8325450"," And then does it get shorted down between now and their next ER?"
"8339760","8341459"," Amazon was a great dip buy."
"8342100","8344299"," Snap, of course, is a good dip buy."
"8352059","8354900"," But Facebook, they could just pin it for one to three months. "
"8357400","8364240"," I think the idea of buying Facebook leaps or much farther out calls."
"8366680","8369780"," Or just buying the stock isn't too bad, even if it trades lower."
"8375500","8377840"," I don't like the idea of buying calls on Facebook. "
"8382510","8383350"," We'll look at it."
"8396620","8398440"," It's a really nice place to buy Facebook."
"8398800","8401720"," You can't say it isn't a nice place to buy Facebook here. "
"8402580","8405580"," But we've been trading PayPal and Snap forever too."
"8406340","8409300"," And we've seen moments like this where you're like, that's the bottom."
"8409300","8413320"," And you find out that you can go lower. "
"8429190","8431510"," I like Facebook, just accumulating it."
"8432130","8434870"," Even for all the shit problems wrong with Facebook."
"8436550","8441110"," I mean, do you like it at 210?"
"8443550","8444030"," Like, question right?"
"8444490","8445230"," You want to own it at 210?"
"8445630","8446390"," Where do you want to own it at?"
"8450770","8452650"," And 200 seems like the place. "
"8453550","8455910"," This is like the Alamo right here, 200."
"8460820","8462180"," I just set an alert of 200."
"8467090","8470590"," If you had a moment of market weakness, probably we'll see 200. "
"8471890","8473490"," Wouldn't even have to be Facebook's fault."
"8480840","8483700"," I know people are going to disagree with that, because this commentary."
"8485440","8489900"," There's a lot of negative news on Facebook right now, even outside of the stock market. "
"8491300","8494680"," We also have some issues coming up with hearings."
"8502160","8504200"," The market looks so weird right now."
"8514450","8516490"," Yeah, I can get the idea of it. "
"8516890","8517730"," They're not going to go bankrupt."
"8522040","8528680"," You know what to compare Facebook to would generally believe it or not is Disney's ER."
"8530220","8538760"," Disney's last ER was very complicated, worth reading into and watching, listening to going down the"
"8538760","8539420"," rabbit hole on. "
"8541740","8544220"," Disney's in a similar place in some respects."
"8552560","8558540"," And I was left a little bit scratching my head with Facebook ER this time as well, because they've"
"8558540","8561020"," made a lot of inroads in other countries."
"8561860","8563980"," And I thought that was the plan, right?"
"8563980","8564900"," We don't really care. "
"8565520","8570260"," Well, the plan is they start them on a different platform, then graduate them into a different"
"8570260","8572420"," platform, then graduate them into Facebook."
"8572980","8573820"," That's what I thought it was."
"8576240","8582960"," We have the kids platform, the 20 to 30 year olds, and then the 40 year old pluses, you roll"
"8582960","8583680"," them into Facebook. "
"8587300","8592700"," And then by searching outside of the country, you track foreign people into Facebook."
"8595080","8598140"," So this whole guidance was kind of weird to me."
"8599820","8603880"," But the rebuilding aspect to it reminded me a lot of Disney rebuilding. "
"8606920","8614320"," And I'd be interested to see what the reaction is this time to Disney, and what implications it"
"8614320","8617540"," would have on Facebook their next ER."
"8622660","8623620"," Make a lot of money."
"8630640","8632720"," Yeah, I'm not just doing anything with any of those things. "
"8635020","8642760"," They, I don't know if you're with anything or you guys are saying about Facebook out there."
"8646570","8647550"," Yeah, I want to flush too."
"8650670","8651910"," I'll be honest with you, we should flush. "
"8664770","8667610"," I mean, it looks like one, two, three taps, right?"
"8667910","8669630"," One, two, three, we should be trading way higher."
"8678100","8680460"," Like one quick blush and then a rip."
"8700410","8702590"," Train right back down to our trading zone. "
"8702990","8719040"," Train right back down to 44.50. Darius,"
"8719500","8725120"," whatever his name is there, Darius so and so he's saying that we could lose 8% on the spy"
"8725120","8725760"," right now."
"8726740","8728020"," I think that was on Friday."
"8728260","8731860"," He said that he's a he's full bear right now. "
"8748880","8756840"," I think I think Maro said this earlier and he's making a fair point like you want to see everything"
"8756840","8758100"," set up, right?"
"8758400","8762620"," Like so if you start looking at the components that make up NASDAQ, right?"
"8762800","8767080"," You start to look at the components that are making up the spy, the heavy hitters."
"8770500","8777540"," It's all kind of weird because you're not seeing defensive plays."
"8778980","8781220"," Positive today are the huge moves today. "
"8787920","8790400"," So there's no defensiveness to the market today."
"8791800","8792980"," It's kind of sideways."
"8798660","8800780"," More dip buyers on spy currently. "
"8803940","8837400"," Seeing a lot of stocks too that are, this"
"8837400","8847260"," does make me wonder if we get, if you end up trapping"
"8847260","8853740"," bulls, a murder, all the puts into the like the 11th, 12th and then we trade down into OpEx."
"8869680","8877720"," First Spotify, seeing a report that the rumble platform reportedly offering Joe Rogan $100 million"
"8877720","8881140"," to move his show to their platform."
"8881800","8892660"," One, two,"
"8893400","8893400"," three. "
"8949140","8956640"," So let's see if acquisition CFVI, which is planning a SPAC merger with rumble, is moving higher on"
"8956640","8961960"," the support that they're trying to lure Joe Rogan to the platform, internally Franklin, Victor,"
"8962160","8962360"," India."
"8964160","8964840"," CFVI."
"8968730","8970750"," It's still the digital world acquisition. "
"8973630","8978370"," The SPAC TWAC is also showing strength today up 13%."
"8982000","8983600"," XLA is about to hit 70 bucks."
"8985300","8986920"," Yeah, it's kind of boring right now. "
"8987420","8990600"," There isn't a whole fuckload going on this morning."
"8992380","8994540"," It's back and forth with day traders."
"9001840","9012460"," Expector, next sell the rip on 450.67. Possibly even selling the rip on 449.99. 450. "
"9028530","9033830"," Federal Reserve Chair Powell traded during restricted FOMC blackout period, failed to disclose"

"9059450","9061290"," You think they're going to wait for the Euro close?"
"9123810","9124410"," Yes."
"9129360","9135120"," Yeah, there's a lot of loading of puts on March 18th. "
"9135800","9144100"," They originally were positioned on February 18th and they've slowly, they were deep, deep outside"
"9144100","9151600"," of the money on puts for February 18th, then they moved to close in the money on February 18th, and"
"9151600","9155020"," then started to move to the 18th of March."
"9158400","9160940"," I think these are straddles on the market."
"9162240","9165600"," Straddles like 470 and then 420 into March. "
"9167260","9167960"," Big ones."
"9169660","9173160"," They're claiming that's all retail doing this shit, but it's not retail."
"9173420","9173740"," It's banks. "
"9185760","9188820"," Yeah, I don't expect any of you to stick around today."
"9189180","9191400"," There isn't a lot going on in the market."
"9191660","9199220"," The only thing that I can tell you about today is that you should expect a big-ass move at"
"9199220","9199940"," some point today. "
"9200280","9203320"," It's moving because we're running out of runway."
"9203320","9213220"," We've got until basically 4pm to make a move higher outside of our trading range"
"9213220","9216060"," for a rejection to go much deeper."
"9217280","9218900"," We don't have time. "
"9224240","9225520"," Facebook's making new lows."
"9227980","9233080"," More from a guard saying there's no sign inflation is measurably above target over the medium term."
"9233080","9234760"," It's utter bullshit. "
"9235000","9237220"," They've got these stories running in the news right now."
"9237660","9239820"," That increase that inflation stabilizes at 2%."
"9240320","9242700"," That we're buying for an ECB chief cigar. "
"9243080","9247300"," We're buying fucking credit spreads by the fucking, you know, million, 10 million dollar blocks."
"9247860","9248540"," Utter bullshit."
"9249660","9254320"," And then there are a bunch of hedge funds, a bunch. "
"9255080","9257960"," I went down a rabbit hole a week or two ago."
"9258020","9258900"," We talked about it on the program."
"9258900","9264280"," We're acknowledging that the ECB will look very carefully at the March projections and if there's"
"9264280","9271060"," no need to rush to premature conclusions pointing to the March where they will be updating their"
"9271060","9272140"," staff projections. "
"9275110","9278870"," So I went back like a week or two ago and I spent some time just seeking out some of"
"9278870","9279050"," these."
"9279250","9282150"," But this is before the news came out on all the hedge funds and lost their asses."
"9283010","9284470"," But we made the first dip, right?"
"9284770","9294000"," So when we made the first dip on January 20, whatever, I mean that first dip down below that we"
"9294000","9296860"," first, when we slowly slammed down on the 24th. "
"9297280","9300000"," And then once again, we slammed down on like 28th."
"9300620","9308640"," There were a shit ton of hedge funds that came out and said that they were long banks and hedge"
"9308640","9309320"," funds like big."
"9310200","9315600"," It's not huge, but like black rock type companies said that they were buying the bottom on this"
"9315600","9316580"," company and that company. "
"9316580","9325940"," And then I went back and looked on CNBC Pro back into September through December."
"9328080","9333700"," Anyone that said we bought this dip, anyone that was on CNBC saying this is the bottom blah blah"
"9333700","9333900"," blah."
"9334300","9335720"," I went back and searched all those companies. "
"9336020","9339020"," They were all fucking long on everything that burned."
"9340040","9343780"," Like anything that's burned, they were pumping it from September to December."
"9344780","9349140"," So let's say they got caught with their pants down, even if they were short in the market. "
"9350540","9355720"," And they rebot again, and they buy time on CNBC to say, hey, we're buying this."
"9356800","9359260"," Hey, we bought this."
"9359460","9360160"," Hey, we bought that. "
"9361880","9367340"," And now there's stories coming out that retail shouldn't be having some have so much protection on."
"9368100","9369160"," But it's not retail."
"9370820","9375380"," My assumption at some point is they got copy and long. "
"9376580","9381840"," They wound up, you know, trading against hedging against right or let's say actively trading it"
"9381840","9382120"," down."
"9383320","9384360"," Shorting the market down."
"9386340","9389140"," And then the moment that looks like there's a breather. "
"9390340","9396180"," Like we're oversold to an extent that they run a campaign to say, you know, we're buying all these"
"9396180","9396440"," stocks."
"9396440","9402520"," When reality, they're just looking for the next chance to get out of those positions."
"9403660","9405160"," I think that's who these sellers are. "
"9405960","9408120"," The sellers aren't retail traders."
"9408400","9411820"," These are sellers are banks that, you know, they made their way down."
"9412800","9414720"," Had to hedge against the market, right?"
"9415060","9415540"," Short the market. "
"9416260","9417520"," Still long and fucking stock."
"9418360","9423180"," They have to bring the stock market back up to sell out of their positions as best they can."
"9426580","9430640"," Well, buying some, some companies, it's very, it's complicated to extend, right?"
"9431000","9432960"," Because then they want to be buying Amazon's. "
"9436770","9440010"," They want to be buying Google's on sell offs, those kinds of things."
"9441730","9445130"," At the same time, there's this whole conversation going on that's retail buying the shit."
"9445250","9445510"," It's not. "
"9446170","9447290"," These are fucking banks."
"9449250","9450690"," That's what they're doing."
"9451010","9455930"," No matter what they're telling you or I in the news media, the numbers aren't lying. "
"9455930","9456490"," They're not."
"9456890","9458570"," These are block trades."
"9458570","9460710"," These are sweep trades of millions. "
"9462670","9466490"," This isn't like a meat Kevin out there buying himself a million dollar package."
"9469670","9471230"," Or $5 million in puts."
"9471470","9472170"," It just doesn't happen. "
"9474850","9478750"," I think there's something different today."
"9480130","9482750"," Versus even 2020 in March."
"9482750","9486510"," I think that you've got so much information today available. "
"9487650","9490070"," That not a lot can be hidden right now."
"9490750","9494150"," There's just too much information to disseminate too many people discussing."
"9495190","9499050"," We were seeing too much in communicating with each other retailers. "
"9499950","9501690"," And what's really going on behind the scenes."
"9514900","9517660"," Yeah, you can't blame retail, but they are."
"9518200","9522240"," They're saying like if retail just took off their hedging that the market would go up and I'm like,"
"9522240","9523500"," this is utter fucking bullshit. "
"9525800","9527060"," utter fucking bullshit."
"9528800","9531920"," And you guys saw the stories that eventually came out."
"9532240","9535440"," How many hedge funds have been getting in just straight wrecked. "
"9537320","9540660"," So right now if there was a time not to trust the news, this is it."
"9540820","9546980"," Even if you're bullish, this is the time to not trust anything in the news right now."
"9548620","9552720"," Well, more than five minutes now of a close of cash equity trade across Europe. "
"9553380","9557840"," Europe, we've seen some underperformance in the Spanish and Italian stock markets, but they have"
"9557840","9559260"," back a bit here into the."
"9559560","9562040"," The DAX is up about nine tens of a percent."
"9562340","9565160"," And that catcrawn up close to one percent along with the FTSE 100. "
"9566720","9569620"," Treasury yields are off the highs of the day across the continent."
"9569800","9572740"," The Italian tenure was up 12 at one point is currently at six."

"11326270","11329790"," It would be buybacks would lift the market up."
"11331150","11337970"," But outside of buybacks, we should sell that only for 4 or 13 or so. "
"11338990","11340470"," I think it should be a bloodbath."
"11364360","11369700"," Seeing this move right here, not seeing a heavy reaction to the upside is concerning."
"11371520","11387390"," A break"
"11387390","11389170"," here would signal a reversal. "
"11390150","11392110"," A continuation and a downward move."
"11400190","11403390"," We'll give you a price target on that too, where to expect it to go."

"11429780","11431120"," This isn't going to be exact."
"11434540","11437160"," You probably see a bloodbath in the close. "
"11440420","11451170"," 436.7. It would"
"11451170","11452450"," be a sweet dip to buy."
"11511180","11513400"," Yeah, the guard needs to shut the fuck up."
"11513400","11517200"," Yeah, no reaction right now. "
"11519180","11520580"," You want to see a bigger bounce?"
"11531710","11533450"," No bigger reaction at the moment."
"11541160","11543300"," You should expect a bounce here, which we got."
"11546170","11547270"," Is it this breaks?"
"11547570","11551110"," If 44720 breaks, even with 444. "
"11552090","11556340"," 4 times 444 below and 4390 below."
"11558080","11562140"," It's a moot point at that point because you're in that downward channel."
"11563000","11565620"," So you're going to want to complete the rest of that downward channel. "
"11567540","11569660"," Regardless of what Spock Emma says."
"11570600","11571900"," You're going to look for."
"11574240","11576280"," Yeah, I move down to complete. "
"11586090","11589690"," I mean, today would be 43662 tomorrow."
"11590690","11594530"," You'd open at 43259 unless."
"11595510","11598050"," We had some kind of obscene sell off. "
"11598870","11605390"," We broke through support and you'd be looking at for probably 415 or something like that."
"11606890","11608790"," 420 would be first stop."
"11611950","11613690"," 408 would be next stop. "
"11616210","11619770"," And 400 would get the bear porn going for the bears."
"11622850","11624130"," We're turning around here."
"11626570","11628030"," I don't know how long this holds. "

"12036480","12037700"," Spy calls coming in."
"12071790","12073290"," Some VXX calls. "
"12082230","12083310"," Slow ass day."
"12107850","12109570"," Yeah, the morning phase has been pretty predictable."
"12113190","12115090"," Like we just fade in the morning and then we rip higher. "
"12123450","12129330"," So that's the key to if we fucking dump down a 420 or lower, you know that you could buy"
"12129330","12130170"," that bottom, right?"
"12130170","12132550"," It doesn't matter if it's 394, 20, whatever."
"12133530","12135890"," Create it back up again to 450, 460, whatever."
"12166970","12168270"," More XYAM calls. "
"12169190","12173270"," March 18th, 87.5 C, $78,000."
"12176350","12181570"," Datadog puts February 11th, 146 P, $648,000."
"12204640","12207860"," Yeah, Tesla get back down to near 900 at some point. "
"12210310","12211230"," So all the day traders are."
"12212050","12216850"," So it got down to 90739 on Tesla, right?"
"12216990","12218150"," We talked about this earlier today."
"12223610","12226110"," So we'll check and see if the day traders will step in on Tesla. "
"12233530","12250480"," I want to look"
"12250480","12251480"," at Datadog real quick."
"12260370","12261170"," Yeah, they had a nice bounce."
"12270920","12273340"," It's a nice put call on Datadog. "
"12275200","12279590"," I like that trade."
"12279590","12286950"," Datadog, February 11th, 146 P, $648,000."
"12305340","12305940"," Beautiful. "
"12336450","12337310"," Check Tesla."
"12343890","12346350"," See if buyers are still sitting down there at 900."
"12350560","12351740"," The other down here waiting. "
"12354100","12356240"," Roughly at 901-21."
"12368650","12370070"," They're moving up a little bit."
"12371470","12373610"," Some buyers at 905-28. "
"12374970","12377610"," Looks like buyers are stepping up now to 902-02."
"12378410","12379810"," They should come swooping up at some point."
"12400330","12409190"," If the bears can't break through around here, you see that one tap on 447.12. If there's another"
"12409190","12412630"," tap once more right now, and then another tap, we should see a reversal. "
"12419710","12421650"," Bears really need to push it through right now."
"12444880","12446520"," They're just looking for two taps right now."
"12447180","12449060"," This is a pretty normal setup. "
"12450200","12453880"," You want to see the bears be able to follow through if they can't follow through twice."
"12454800","12456780"," The third time it should trade much higher."
"12457500","12458900"," You should see it reversal. "
"12477500","12478700"," It's a nice little bear flag."
"12479400","12480560"," You've got to get it done right now."
"12482080","12483060"," Come on bears!"
"12532390","12535130"," You can get down or anything from this. "
"12535710","12536930"," The hero indicator."
"12538490","12540370"," The indicator is going up right now."
"12540990","12541410"," Heads up. "
"12550710","12551790"," What are you guys saying?"
"12558960","12560300"," We're rooting for the bears."
"12560960","12562640"," This is going to put a bunch of insult to you."
"12563640","12565140"," That's my thing about..."
"12565140","12566560"," That's my thing about..."
"12567080","12568720"," That's my thing about..."
"12568720","12570180"," Like the Sims, right?"
"12570900","12572380"," Like, what is it going to be?"
"12572940","12574720"," Like, I get the meta..."
"12575760","12576820"," So, in my view..."
"12579480","12584720"," If metaverse was awesome, you'd probably get a good decade or two of..."
"12586860","12588720"," Something that's built..."
"12591520","12592720"," Like the Wild West. "
"12596670","12597370"," Kinda, right?"
"12600290","12603390"," But then you've got a Facebook trying to just make it look like Facebook."
"12604650","12605970"," Reminds me of the Sims..."
"12605970","12607650"," Well, the Sims, I guess, was kind of cool one time."
"12609670","12610030"," But..."
"12610030","12610970"," Like, what are they going to do?"
"12611570","12613070"," They'd be so boring and..."
"12613070","12614290"," In myopic..."
"12616730","12617450"," A Facebook..."
"12617450","12618290"," Metaverse would be like..."
"12620310","12621450"," Just be asking for..."
"12626700","12627600"," For it to burn. "
"12629180","12630620"," You know what reminds me of..."
"12630620","12631780"," Reminds me of Comcast."
"12634560","12636500"," Like your cable TV provider..."
"12638820","12642240"," Tries to control everything, right?"
"12643040","12644420"," Control your TV experience..."
"12646140","12647140"," DRM on everything."
"12648520","12650140"," You can't donate, you can only rent it. "
"12651460","12652640"," Then the fees go through the roof."
"12654960","12658760"," It's a very closed garden that isn't an enjoyable experience."
"12663160","12664600"," And so..."
"12669300","12673600"," You know what else was like that was like AOL was like that when the internet started. "
"12676100","12678400"," And they didn't survive because of that..."
"12678400","12683600"," That closed environment when something that's exploding and growing and is new."
"12684760","12688380"," So if you even think that we're going to have a Metaverse..."
"12689620","12691380"," It's probably not with Facebook..."
"12693560","12695120"," Being like the Bridge Troll."
"12698770","12701110"," Can you just imagine having to live in the Metaverse?"
"12702410","12706730"," Can you imagine living in the Metaverse of a Facebook's version of the Metaverse?"
"12709070","12710110"," It'd be so bizarre. "
"12722150","12724090"," Yeah fuck Pete on, I'm standing my puts."
"12728930","12730370"," That bears get like..."
"12730370","12732890"," You know they get one, two tries, right?"
"12734030","12736370"," You have to understand like you have to like..."
"12736370","12738610"," Look at it from the perspective of a bearable."
"12739170","12741090"," You take one stab at it, right?"
"12741470","12742910"," You take two stabs at it. "
"12744010","12745590"," You take three stabs at it."
"12746850","12748990"," If the sellers are there, the sellers are there."
"12749130","12751930"," If the sellers aren't there, then we're going to go back up. "
"12754530","12754930"," So..."
"12759690","12764370"," I should show you guys some of these setups on these days so you can see what I'm talking about"
"12764370","12764550"," here."
"12784770","12785970"," You only get so many chances."
"12786590","12788830"," They don't just sit there and..."
"12788830","12789610"," Well they do. "
"12790070","12794350"," If you sit there and trade sideways for a couple days, two or three days, your ass is going down."
"12795030","12796730"," And that is one thing we talked about on Friday."
"12797630","12799630"," You can't as a bull. "
"12800650","12801430"," Like we're on what?"
"12801610","12803790"," One, two, this is day three."
"12804410","12806350"," I'm in a day three of trading sideways."
"12807470","12809470"," So the bulls can't put it together at some point. "
"12811110","12813330"," You're going to wind up trading down."
"12814510","12817810"," That's ultimately what happens if you can't put it together."
"12819590","12825930"," If you can't find the market to step in and say we're going higher, over time, we end up trading"
"12825930","12826290"," lower. "
"12834820","12838020"," And this would be the do or die moment for the bear, for the bulls."
"12838960","12841260"," It's kind of like your last, your last, this is the Alamo."
"12848510","12854260"," So the bulls have to step it up by the fucking dip. "
"12861890","12862710"," This is it."
"12867530","12869850"," If the bulls don't get it, if the bulls don't turn it on."
"12877590","12879170"," And the bulls did come in and buy. "
"12879350","12880390"," I want to give you guys a heads up."
"12880650","12888390"," So we were at 160 or 140,000 calls on February 7 on 450."
"12888830","12893830"," We're now up to 208,000 calls on the spy for 450. "
"12894370","12904290"," I don't know what that means, but there's a bull load of call buyers on 450 C, 208,000 now"
"12904290","12908210"," on cheap call buyers."
"12910830","12915690"," They are loading the fuck up of the boat on calls on 450 C."
"12926340","12935800"," Amazon February 11th, 3300 C, 170 C, Disney March 18th, 145 C."
"12936320","12937540"," Half million dollars."
"12958470","12959670"," Gonzalo, thank you for tipping. "
"12959830","12960470"," I appreciate it, brother."
"12962550","12964770"," Yeah, please like and subscribe these videos if you can."
"12969170","12970610"," Please like and support. "
"12972270","12976330"," If you're a new trader, if you're just joining us, you'd like to keep the seat."

"12984430","12985770"," Keep the channel live."
"12986970","12991090"," A little bit of reversal here on the market."
"12992330","12994210"," Trading now up to 448. "
"13015310","13019290"," Those spy calls at 50 cents now up to 55 cents."
"13020910","13023010"," 210,000 buyers."
"13027350","13030770"," 210,000 contracts on 450 C."
"13064130","13068080"," 211,000 contracts now up to 56 cents. "
"13069310","13071230"," 57 cents."
"13111840","13113820"," Spy calls coming in."
"13114680","13117480"," February 7th, 452 C."
"13118740","13119780"," Hog, we talked about them. "
"13120580","13123680"," Harley-Davidson, February 11th, 38C."
"13124320","13126700"," A couple hundred thousand dollars a sweep and a block."
"13128660","13131780"," They usually do fairly good at their earnings. "
"13136830","13145770"," For ATT, the La Trojio Entertainment's doing Warner Brothers over the movie release of Matrix"
"13145770","13148310"," Resurrection simultaneously in HBO, Max."
"13150680","13157800"," The La Trojio led to Warner Brothers' attempting to cut it down to future movie moves and shows"
"13157800","13159060"," based on the IP."
"13172970","13174790"," Yeah, we'll see if they, we'll see if they print. "
"13175850","13176990"," Get to the reversal here."
"13177330","13178470"," Kind of like do or die for the bulls."
"13178690","13179310"," They really don't have a choice. "
"13180630","13181330"," They have to pump it."
"13182530","13183470"," It's by the fucking dip."
"13184630","13185430"," They don't have a fucking choice. "
"13186070","13186530"," This is it."
"13188190","13189670"," So this is all there is."
"13189870","13191570"," You got to trade this higher. "
"13192710","13194910"," This isn't this isn't Friday."
"13196770","13198510"," This is make this motherfucker rip."
"13198690","13199870"," Sorry, I shouldn't be swearing like that. "
"13201410","13202570"," This is make a rip."
"13203230","13203950"," Do or die."
"13204930","13214200"," The bulls have to push it higher. "
"13217760","13219100"," They really don't have a choice here."
"13222530","13226130"," Now there's 212,000 contracts on 450C."
"13228770","13230380"," The bulls are stepping in. "
"13230380","13237080"," Is even if it's not showing on, even if it's not showing on Flow Algo behind the scenes, bulls are"
"13237080","13238020"," buying the dip here."
"13247360","13250300"," 213,000 contracts on 450C."
"13292790","13294610"," Might be a nice dip bite down here. "
"13294830","13357280"," 447.62. It's"
"13415870","13417590"," kind of a weird place for the VIX right now."
"13460610","13462910"," January 19, 2024."
"13465460","13469040"," X calls 25C $1.1 million. "
"13486390","13493330"," QQQ calls February 7, 357C $49,000."
"13507440","13511660"," Spy is still holding on by its last breath."
"13512600","13521720"," So this would be the third strike here. "
"13522040","13523280"," One, two, and three."
"13523500","13524220"," We'll see if it holds."
"13525400","13532900"," If it doesn't hold, price target below, ultimately by end of day should be 436, 437. "
"13533940","13535940"," You can see another a nice 100 point move."
"13580200","13586180"," Spy puts February 7, 446P for $63,000."
"13621510","13622970"," Bull's less chance here. "
"13643070","13644050"," So exciting."
"13655950","13658010"," Now there shouldn't be a sideways trade here."
"13658170","13660810"," This is do or die for technically on the charts. "
"13661670","13665630"," This is do or die for the bulls here, right where we are right now."
"13666950","13671990"," You would see if it fails here, you'll see a trade down about 100 points."
"13672270","13673670"," It shouldn't take more than a day or two. "
"13674510","13678720"," And that day includes today."
"13679140","13680760"," You'd see it today and tomorrow."
"13684550","13689790"," Calls on XOM February 11, 84C $22,000. "
"13716410","13720710"," Not seeing a whole bunch of puts or calls waiting on either side."
"13721590","13723330"," Watching a mixed bag of calls and puts."
"13724730","13726570"," No cascade yet of puts. "
"13727770","13733670"," Facebook calls coming in February 18, 250C for $162,000."
"13735270","13776860"," Give me"
"13776860","13778220"," 100 points in any direction."
"13778560","13778960"," I'll take it. "
"13781480","13789040"," X calls February or January 19, 2024, 25C for $300,000."
"13806660","13809720"," Looks like firm sellers again up here at 451."
"13810860","13813360"," Look higher and see if there's anything higher than that. "
"13828480","13830400"," 458, 90, 460."
"13855180","13862400"," More Facebook calls February 18, 250C, $84,000."
"13881320","13882620"," No, no, no, no, no. "
"13889820","13893760"," You can call it 10 points or 100 points."
"13894420","13895780"," So like ticks, right?"
"13896060","13896540"," Almost like ticks."
"13896880","13901840"," So you'd see like, you'd see 437, 436. "
"13903360","13905800"," It's like what 10 or 100, depending on how you count."
"13907520","13908900"," Depends on how you count the market."
"13909900","13911180"," Some people count what they've been like through. "
"13911360","13913340"," That tick can be three points."
"13913660","13914740"," It depends on how you count the market."
"13915680","13916300"," I like the spy. "
"13917180","13921820"," I usually count it by the 10th."
"13923760","13925180"," Like every 10 cents is a dollar."
"13926260","13927840"," Every dollar is 10. "
"13932860","13935200"," Yeah, I'm talking about the spy."
"13939720","13945260"," I don't count the spy like, I don't say 10 points means $10."
"13946680","13947880"," 100 points, $10. "
"13965810","13975570"," I want, I want, I want double that, to be honest with you."
"13975910","13976590"," I want more than that."
"13976650","13977070"," I want 150. "
"13985030","13986230"," I want it into the bell."
"13986970","13992430"," I got to check my puts and see if they've gained any interest, a premium or not."
"13996030","13996430"," Nope. "
"14000000","14001860"," It doesn't look like anybody thinks it's happening now."
"14004340","14006100"," Marketmakers don't think it's happening right now."
"14014030","14016230"," Even if we do sell off, it's not going to be that deep. "
"14018770","14020390"," In one of them, weak ass sell-offs."
"14035410","14040290"," QQQ's calls, February 7th, 57C."
"14040550","14047570"," It's only 45 grand, AMC calls, February 11th, 17C for 26,000. "
"14065970","14066610"," Let's look lower."
"14076440","14079280"," Two were real supporters down here if we break through all this noise."
"14081590","14083560"," It's all accumulation shit down here. "
"14085140","14086520"," See all this traffic?"
"14097450","14109210"," Some sneaky buyers down here, 442.81. Look"
"14109210","14110010"," at that right there."
"14113450","14114090"," 442."
"14115930","14139340"," 442.80. Not"
"14139340","14140420"," really anything big there. "
"14185570","14187630"," Not really giant, small heart."
"14190530","14191690"," It's 436."
"14194770","14195750"," It'll go lower. "
"14197870","14198750"," Get there."
"14204920","14205820"," Big boy."
"14221050","14222990"," Alright, I'm going to step away for just a few minutes. "
"14222990","14232570"," It's spy calls coming in right now, February 7, 450C, $38,000, Palantir, February 11, 13.5. I'm"
"14232570","14233870"," going to take a break real quick."
"14234530","14237390"," It's 12.41. I'll be back for 1 PM."
"14237770","14239330"," I'll leave the news on, of course, for you. "
"14240310","14244250"," You're either going to be looking for a reversal here or a sell-the-market type situation."
"14245770","14247870"," Pretty much right where we are at this level."
"14249590","14254910"," You want to see the bears with conviction sell-the-market. "
"14255070","14258610"," If they can't sell-the-market, the bulls are going to try to push it up higher."
"14259550","14261630"," The bulls are running out of runway, right?"
"14261730","14265190"," We've been here for, I want to say, four days."
"14265950","14266490"," I think I'll look here. "
"14268610","14274190"," Been here for, let's call it legitimately, the end of the close of Thursday."
"14274790","14277990"," In Friday, we traded up a trade down again today."
"14279010","14283890"," The key, though, is that we're in this expanding-ish microphone here. "
"14284410","14289550"," It's kind of a weird one, two, three, four-day megaphone pattern."
"14291070","14301000"," And we're also inside this megaphone pattern, and you"
"14301000","14309420"," really are looking for, I want to say back in the second, we traded to a major resistance, bounced"
"14309420","14312360"," off it, because we were rejected, basically, right?"
"14313080","14317920"," And we haven't been able to even trade up into that major resistance again."
"14318520","14320260"," You get one try and another try. "
"14320420","14329980"," If we don't get that try, if this isn't, I guess my point would be if we rejected"
"14329980","14339160"," back on the second up here for $4.57, $4.58, we're taking another stab at it again."
"14339340","14345440"," If we don't take that stab at it, you're going to be looking back to a much larger drop."
"14347460","14349740"," I guess some people want to say it's four. "
"14352220","14358740"," Hopefully it's $4.35, or $4.32, $4.33, but in reality, if you're not able to get back up"
"14358740","14368340"," to retest one more time above, the larger channel puts us down to ugly vell, like real ugly."
"14375800","14377560"," I'm looking on the one hour right now."
"14378520","14380300"," It seems like there's some support here. "
"14380540","14383540"," The one hour there's a nice green bar here, so we'll see if it's around or not."
"14383880","14395320"," It's a nice red"
"14395320","14397400"," bar, nice red bar, the last hour."
"14397620","14398940"," This new hour, we're green right now. "
"14399420","14402260"," It might not be shown on the chart about one minute or 15 minutes."
"14402260","14404040"," From the one hour, it's showing it."
"14405500","14407400"," It's a very nice bottom wick green candle. "
"14407560","14408420"," We'll see if it trades higher."
"14412510","14415910"," It is not looking good for the bulls right now, but we'll see."
"14416490","14418390"," This is kind of a do or die for the bulls, right?"
"14418610","14420850"," The bulls are claiming that they want to trade it up higher. "
"14421430","14427830"," See if they can get up to $4.50 or even $4.60. The bulls have their own case."
"14428770","14431150"," We do have some spy calls coming in right now."
"14431150","14433190"," We have some IBM calls for $160,000. "
"14433410","14438250"," Spy calls February 11th, 448C for $228,000."
"14440820","14442560"," We'll see how this plays out in the end."
"14442980","14444220"," We've seen moves like this before. "
"14444560","14447100"," We're weak in the morning and then we trade higher."
"14448040","14448320"," We'll see."
"14448480","14448960"," There should be. "
"14449380","14454000"," Spy Cam is implying that there's a 1.3% move today."
"14454900","14458540"," Probably has seen almost half of it at this point today."
"14458540","14464600"," The second half of it could be down below to that $4.44 level into the bell. "
"14465320","14471440"," If we had a capitulation, if we haven't got down here to $4.44, I do think we're trading much,"
"14471580","14472020"," much lower."
"14473300","14473820"," Much."
"14474900","14484820"," A weekly timeframe at least down to $4.34.36. Might as well just trade to the bottom"
"14484820","14486060"," of the channel below here. "
"14486060","14495820"," Just call it at $4.34. Another node would be in this 1.2.3 pattern in the larger timeframe."
"14496680","14500560"," Going back to the 21st until now."
"14502020","14505960"," We traded above this range on the 2nd. "
"14506620","14508940"," It would only be in kind of below that range."
"14509860","14516040"," A little bit down here around $4.20 or so."
"14516840","14518400"," We'll also have a lot of work to do from here. "
"14523800","14526100"," I'll be back at 2 p.m. unless something else changes."
"14825420","14827960"," You're listening to Trade the News."
"15379780","15383280"," Are you television GTN acquiring telemundo?"
"15383400","15383800"," It's Lanta. "
"15384700","15385400"," I'll think of November."
"15688460","15695750"," I wanted to step in real quick and comment on what Doboy just said."
"15697290","15698230"," Which is important. "
"15700670","15702850"," It's not good when VIX is above 23."
"15704050","15708810"," And it's not good when SPY is below $4,500."
"15712650","15716330"," It lends us to a lot of volatility. "
"15717110","15718950"," There are a lot of SPY calls coming in right now."
"15719470","15725050"," There's a SPY calls just came in February 11th, 448C for $335,000."
"15726150","15735710"," But if you look at the general viewpoint on the SPY right now, I just want to be clear that"
"15735710","15739030"," volatility lies below $4,500. "
"15743060","15747300"," The VIX at 23 also lends us to volatility."
"15747980","15755680"," And that's what I think Doboy's pointing out that it's sitting above 23 is not good."
"15756260","15758960"," Those things don't add up to us going up. "
"15760920","15762220"," It doesn't mean we don't go up."
"15762540","15770120"," It just means that you really want to see to be bullish that we're over $4.50. Over $4.50"
"15770120","15778960"," and over $4.5.20. Hopefully we can make our way up here to at least this $4.51 and"
"15778960","15780660"," get rid of some of these sellers here."
"15781180","15790300"," We can see how bad those sellers are. "
"15790420","15795520"," It does look like we have worn out some of the sellers and still some pretty decent sellers above"
"15795520","15802350"," here at $4.51. We'll trade it up and see what happens."
"15839150","15844890"," I think Doboy, if you guys definitely want to be reaching out to Doboy Capital because he has a"
"15844890","15847250"," pretty firm grasp of most of these concepts as well."
"15847250","15853850"," When it comes to volatility, gamma levels and things like that. "
"15854690","15856170"," That doesn't mean we don't trade up here."
"15856310","15863210"," It just means that if you guys are looking for a basis, what are we at this moment in today?"
"15864010","15867010"," You don't want to see VIX up in the 23 zone."
"15867490","15873290"," It lends itself to negative volatility or volatility and negative gamma. "
"15873290","15875910"," Plus where we are below $4,500."
"15877530","15879230"," That's why those sellers are up here."
"15879570","15886950"," These sellers are here $4.51. That's because once we break above this $4.51, we should have clear"
"15886950","15887390"," skies. "
"15888130","15892750"," It was supposed to be $4.50 to $4.52, I believe."
"15893270","15893990"," It doesn't matter."
"15894210","15896330"," We know where it is actually during the day here. "
"15898490","15901970"," We want to be above here into the close today."
"15901970","15904210"," More spy calls coming in right now."
"15904370","15905070"," A little bit of spy puts. "
"15906470","15908150"," You like spy calls."
"15908710","15909970"," February 7th, 451."
"15910290","15911290"," See for $34,000. "
"15912370","15916220"," Spy puts to $7,448 P for $87,000."
"15916850","15921110"," Then spy calls February 11th, 452 C for $200,000."
"15924210","15930910"," We might get rejected here too as an intraday SMA here. "
"15930910","15934930"," The 200 want to break through this if we can."
"15935070","15939030"," If you're a bull, you want to be breaking through this and then working our way back up to this"
"15939030","15942470"," localized resistance at $4.50, $36 or so."
"15944250","15947810"," It's like the sellers come down slightly over here at some point. "
"15950070","15951310"," The time's running out."
"15951410","15956910"," If you're bullish, time is not on your side right now."
"15964750","15966570"," I'm actually a bull by trade. "
"15967890","15971310"," Mostly bullish, like 70% of the time, bearish, 30% of the time."
"15975190","15976770"," But this isn't where you want to be as a bull."
"15977850","15979110"," You're kind of back into a corner. "
"15984380","15984820"," Yeah."
"15985060","15985460"," Cover each alone."
"15985660","15987600"," If vix gets under 23, we run big time. "
"15988600","15989320"," Big time."
"16000840","16003140"," There is more premium leaking into this."
"16003140","16008180"," I'm in some 451 C's of 39.40 cents. "
"16008300","16009000"," 41 cents."
"16009520","16012200"," There is some good premium kicking in right now on spy calls."
"16013100","16014320"," We'll see how that goes. "
"16016400","16018120"," You have to 42 cents."
"16019040","16020300"," There is some interest here."
"16020960","16024580"," There's now also 250,000 calls at that 450 strike. "
"16038340","16044900"," We're at VWAP now at the $4.48.97. Let's see if we can make our way to 450."
"16049350","16053670"," 450.87. No one expect them to come down though."
"16054470","16063710"," Look for volatility at $4.49.93. And then again somewhere around $4.50.28. Present point, CPG. "
"16065450","16076620"," For CPG,"
"16076780","16080180"," those assets worth around $500 million Canadian."
"16082200","16083960"," Yeah, I've got some books on my shelf."
"16084160","16085120"," I'll pull them out for you. "
"16085380","16085700"," Let me see."
"16094320","16095980"," Well, they got some good books on volatility."
"16096880","16098380"," I'll get you guys a list by tomorrow. "
"16100460","16103000"," I'll get you books on volatility and gala."
"16114040","16122360"," U.N. U.S. Energy Councils for exploring new gas, transit routes, and capacity from the U-2 Ukraine."
"16130860","16132030"," Those calls are now pumping. "
"16148080","16151720"," Spy calls, February 7 to 4.49 C for 60."
"16152540","16153540"," Excuse me, 50,000."
"16155520","16158960"," More spy calls, February 7, $66,000. "
"16159680","16163940"," PQ's, $48,000 on February 7, 358 C."
"16165360","16169100"," PayPal, March 11, 125 C, $600,000."
"16175290","16176150"," It's tough air."
"16176310","16180830"," When you're looking at the entire market and where we are like coming into this morning, that this"
"16180830","16183110"," isn't the place you want to be as a bull or a bear. "
"16184410","16191830"," You really want like, you want to that level below to have broken as a bear, and you want to"
"16191830","16198290"," break or you want to break above that $4.50 or $6 area as a bull to get bullish."
"16198290","16201870"," Like right where we are right now, it could go anyway."
"16210620","16215420"," I haven't, yeah, it did cross the 200 on the simple day in the one minute, which is nice. "
"16216000","16218320"," That means it's bull currently for the moment."
"16219840","16224140"," I missed on the 200 simple day, simple moving average on the one minute chart we did."
"16224740","16225740"," I'll check the five and 15. "
"16230340","16232680"," They're crossing over it right now in the five minute."
"16234860","16239000"," On the 15, we're right at, nope, we're not even close to it."
"16239600","16243880"," On the SMA and the 15 minute chart is right where it upper resistances. "
"16245440","16251720"," For that, that, uh, pennant is, top of that pennant is right at that $4.50, $35."
"16253480","16261050"," A little red bar on the, uh, on the 50 minute chart right now on spy."
"16263710","16264650"," It's tough play. "
"16264770","16268010"," It's tough place right now to be traded in the spy, especially day trading."
"16268630","16269210"," It's brutal."
"16275530","16280530"," WFC calls February 18, 58 C, $272,000. "
"16280910","16283310"," They're a good bid today on financials."
"16284450","16288170"," So it doesn't lend itself, you know, none of this stuff really adds up to the guy."
"16288250","16288530"," They're right. "
"16289650","16291350"," You got financials holding their own today."
"16291850","16294330"," When financials are down, it's real bad."
"16294330","16295970"," It shows that the market's going to burn. "
"16296450","16297510"," You guys didn't know that."
"16297970","16303490"," When financials are burning, it's a, it's a leading indicator of a crashing market."
"16303850","16306050"," Not crashing, but a very weak market. "
"16307270","16313130"," None of the, like, XLU, XLP, XLV, none of that shit was up today as well."
"16314770","16318310"," Uh, XLE is kind of holding up the spy to an extent."
"16319170","16323750"," The first rate of operation, 81 kind of already seeking $1.68 trillion. "
"16326640","16330520"," It'd have to go, I should look at a sectors, let me go look at a sector chart and see"
"16330520","16331500"," what sectors are up today."
"16359270","16362690"," Yeah, XLF is kind of a XLU lead in the way."
"16372120","16374700"," Really bizarre, like biotech lead in the way. "
"16374820","16379500"," We talked about that before this morning, but it looks like it's all energy."
"16380040","16382040"," You've got some miners working."
"16382820","16388020"," Some metal miners working well for the home builders is surprisingly up today. "
"16388140","16389640"," Construction surprisingly up today."
"16391720","16396259"," It's more like a broad-based light market being held up."
"16397800","16403700"," And the tech part of the spy is slightly down. "
"16414349","16417270"," Yeah, construction's up too, but it's only up slightly."
"16418610","16419930"," It's not up a ton."
"16423439","16428200"," You know, another thing too is, do you guys want me to post, do you guys want me to post"
"16428200","16437599"," the spy gamma report every morning before the day starts so you guys can read through it or that"
"16437599","16438259"," something you guys want?"
"16439220","16443020"," I can just bring it up on a live stream every morning or something. "
"16443180","16443720"," We can review it."
"16445180","16450439"," Do you guys get a feel for market shit today?"
"16450439","16453919"," I'm looking across every sector of the SPX today."
"16454619","16455779"," It ain't pretty. "
"16456619","16462240"," I would tell you right now, if energy fell, the market would be fucked right now."
"16464460","16466980"," I'm not just oiled, but like the whole energy sector."
"16472759","16474400"," I can review with you guys. "
"16474599","16475919"," That way you can understand how to read it."
"16480140","16480700"," Okay."
"16482919","16483320"," Yeah. "
"16483840","16486740"," I do a pretty good job interpreting SPX gamma."
"16488240","16490040"," I went down the SPX gamma hole."
"16493220","16498140"," And it's probably, it's not the, it's not exacting, but it's pretty, pretty close most of the time. "
"16498640","16500000"," It's weird because you have to interpret it."
"16500640","16501520"," I think they do."
"16501640","16505560"," The one thing that SPX gamma does is, the one thing that bothers me, not doesn't bother me, but"
"16505560","16512419"," they use a lot of words to get out of being pinned down as to which direction the market's actually"
"16512419","16512619"," going. "
"16516099","16525460"," I use it more to validate volume profile and then traditional charting"
"16525460","16528599"," news events, stuff like that."
"16530939","16533419"," It's the way it works, it works, but sometimes it doesn't, right?"
"16534360","16539560"," But it works, but you're like, yeah, Pritan's propping us up."
"16541320","16542340"," Yeah, I'll go through with it. "
"16542500","16543740"," I'll go through with you guys every day."
"16544860","16546259"," We'll do it in the live stream every morning."
"16546259","16550840"," I'll just bring up the sheet every morning and we'll go through it so you can kind of interpret"
"16550840","16552520"," what they're trying to say to you. "
"16556360","16557160"," And it's kind of weird."
"16557460","16564560"," Like, like today I'm watching for, like today I'm watching to see what the put flow is to see if"
"16564560","16570140"," it backs up any kind of a down, any kind of a down."
"16574140","16576580"," Opex, because I'm really not really even looking at today. "
"16576640","16578360"," I'm more interested in Opex."
"16579279","16582640"," We start to run out of runway as we get closer to Opex most months."
"16584099","16586300"," As we get into like the 10th, 11th, 12th. "
"16586680","16590500"," You'll hear me say this every month, but like as soon as we get into that 10th, 11th, 12th, we"
"16590500","16591900"," haven't done what we're supposed to do."
"16592939","16599580"," We actually start to trade sideways and down into typically into Opex with maybe one up down on the"
"16599580","16600540"," Thursday before Opex."
"16603759","16604800"," We'll do it live. "
"16609700","16611180"," Yeah, exactly."
"16611700","16613279"," If Peton was down today's bad, we have 430."
"16614000","16616360"," It's kind of bizarre even before the announcement on Peton. "
"16617439","16620640"," Peton was trading with tech on our updates."
"16621619","16624619"," Peton was literally trying to make a comeback on those days."
"16627560","16637119"," And I am interested in catching a lot of the guidance reports coming out. "
"16637360","16643980"," On these tickers specifically, I always like mid caps, like lower big caps, stuff like that."
"16645180","16647380"," I'm interested to see what a lot of these companies are saying."
"16648960","16652439"," Because they could let they could lend themselves to a violent market reaction to downside. "
"16653820","16658759"," You don't know a lot of these companies have been, you know, sitting in offices, no staff."
"16659439","16661040"," It's basically bullshitting."
"16668720","16670040"," And Peton's one of them. "
"16670160","16671919"," Peton's proved themselves to be one of them."
"16672279","16675580"," And you can see it with Spirit and Frontier having to merge, right?"
"16675740","16679800"," You might see a lot of mergers this year in companies."
"16687300","16688020"," Yeah, fuck it. "
"16688040","16688500"," I'll do it live."
"16690800","16693340"," I'll do it live every day with a spot camera."
"16693560","16694580"," I do love spot camera. "
"16697619","16698939"," They are pretty accurate."
"16699500","16703240"," Like they get all their numbers right, but then it doesn't always trade where they think it's going"
"16703240","16703520"," to trade."
"16703800","16704800"," That's my issue, I think, mostly. "
"16710000","16712279"," We'll run out of the runway into the end of today, too."
"16712279","16720820"," This is further reinforces the we can have a very steep sell off into close for a very huge climb"
"16720820","16721540"," into close."
"16723580","16724980"," I'm having a hard time. "
"16725599","16730220"," I look at traditional charts right now on the spy on E.S. Doesn't matter."
"16730400","16740180"," Yes, by having a real tough go of being over"
"16740180","16740960"," bullsh right now."
"16745430","16749230"," If they so right now, if you looked at an E.S., if I was looking at an E.S."
"16749330","16751890"," chart right now, and it was 2020 or 2021. "
"16754450","16756430"," You'd be heading towards all time highs right now."
"16757650","16759110"," In like two days, three days."
"16763590","16765650"," Did you really hear a rumor that Tesla might buy Mercedes?"
"16766790","16769810"," I'm going to call my family number and ask him right now. "
"16771290","16772529"," I'm going to call the family."
"16775890","16776570"," I will."
"16783260","16785460"," Yeah, this was so this set up right here. "
"16787930","16791590"," If this was 2020 or 2021, we'd be going straight to the moon right now."
"16792490","16793570"," Like through the roof."
"16800930","16802770"," That's a real rumor I can ask. "
"16804770","16806630"," I shouldn't say that live on air."
"16807810","16809250"," Again, trouble saying that shit."
"16813110","16815330"," Yeah, I know. "
"16815450","16816210"," Again, the deep shit."
"16816290","16816950"," If I ever did that."
"16818950","16819390"," Uber. "
"16820970","16825590"," A sweep and two splits for a little over a half million dollars."
"16826010","16827730"," Ever 18 40 40 C."
"16835570","16838890"," I always break his balls."
"16839130","16840650"," I'm going to ask him for insider information. "
"16841950","16843110"," Then I tell him not to."
"16846050","16850610"," If they made an offer on Mercedes, Tesla would go down."
"16866500","16868120"," They'll see if he'd trade this up to 450. "
"16869620","16870800"," Yeah, these calls are going to do."
"16876780","16879760"," I might cover my shitty puts that aren't going to print today."
"16880800","16882140"," I end up burning these to the ground. "
"16882140","16884440"," I can tell X down BX, reportedly."
"16886000","16886420"," It's."
"16888060","16892680"," Yeah, merging BME with NASA at CDC. "
"16894280","16895460"," What is this?"
"16897340","16899420"," Yeah, BX unfortunately."
"16900440","16904660"," Looking to get a six billion euro valuation for the BME assets."
"16905920","16906960"," Any potential deal. "
"16912700","16914300"," Oh, this blackstone."
"16916140","16918520"," The X check the X right now."
"16918940","16922540"," I was just I was just ripping on blackstone last night. "
"16922700","16923720"," I got yelled at on the Internet."
"16941150","16943050"," Put a room with a p-tons behind ribbon."
"16957830","16958790"," Wild blackstone. "
"16959050","16961450"," I was just talking about blackstone last night on Twitter."
"16962190","16962750"," And I got ripped."
"16964610","16965030"," Hilarious. "
"16967350","16968090"," Wonder why."
"16986670","16989750"," Oh, we're partly discussing merger of BME with CBC."
"17010220","17011180"," Look at Bull's share. "
"17036590","17038190"," Oh, no, I was making fun of black rock yesterday."
"17038350","17039090"," That's what I was making fun of."
"17040050","17041550"," Now, blackstone, black rock. "
"17044030","17045370"," This is the blackstone group."
"17049900","17051600"," We can find a black rock last night."
"17055460","17057660"," I'm helping stocks into September and December. "
"17059000","17063200"," I think I'm one of their old lackeys out there saying the market's going to burn."
"17064460","17066180"," And they're like, oh, he's not our friend anymore."
"17066320","17067200"," I'm like, that's bullshit. "
"17091880","17092980"," More spy calls."
"17095340","17095740"," 29454C."
"17101540","17103340"," 5451s are now up to 80, 48 cents. "
"17103340","17104920"," I'll just dip a little bit."
"17106780","17116750"," A bunch"
"17116750","17118030"," of paper-handed bulls."
"17123950","17124810"," It's really bizarre. "
"17125230","17128170"," So the Elliott Wave guys have it two ways right now, right?"
"17128810","17132210"," They basically have us go into like 460, let's call it."
"17132210","17133150"," Let's see where Bull's say."
"17133690","17138170"," They have us basically go in like somewhere between 460 and 465, let's call it. "
"17138430","17139030"," Let me look at a bigger chart."
"17142330","17143550"," There's a bunch of different counts here, right?"
"17143550","17151530"," You count up to like 460, 465, and then trade down to, I don't know,"
"17152150","17156670"," trade down to like 437."
"17157770","17160250"," Like 464.5 and a 437. "
"17161570","17163990"," Basically where one of the counts is."
"17164650","17168210"," But then there's a bigger count, a much bigger count."
"17169290","17176230"," That sends us way down to the depths of hell, like 415, 490, depending on how ugly it gets. "
"17178910","17181370"," In that other count, the first one I was talking about is like 465."
"17182810","17188650"," Then it comes down to like 435, and then it goes to all-time highs, and then it goes down"
"17188650","17189450"," to the pits of hell."
"17191410","17197490"," No matter which way you count it, there's a nasty ending to the whole entire thing. "
"17198490","17199630"," Did you guys know that?"
"17209860","17216240"," Yeah, there's like a, in both counts, it still sells off to the depths of hell."
"17230100","17236460"," It calls on Peton right now, February 11th, 32C for $410,000."
"17245200","17246200"," Fuckin' Peton. "
"17255680","17256600"," What's going on?"
"17260650","17262350"," Lights by puts coming in."
"17263330","17266330"," This short, let me see a look."
"17278510","17280170"," Keep it as in 445ps. "
"17282930","17283990"," Did I sell now?"
"17285190","17285650"," None of my calls."
"17289460","17291280"," I have 48 cents in these four ones."
"17295940","17296840"," That's what I put in my..."
"17298930","17299590"," All right, I'm right back. "
"17299750","17300130"," I'm gonna take a break."
"17300970","17301270"," No."
"17301630","17304610"," I don't know if I can take a break. "
"17305530","17305970"," Like eyeball."
"17306170","17307110"," I'm sitting here with you guys."
"17310590","17311890"," I'm gonna do that?"
"17312830","17314030"," I'm sitting here with you guys. "
"17314210","17316650"," I was gonna take a break, but then I'm watching them..."
"17319150","17324880"," I'm watching my calls."
"17326220","17332570"," What do I say in there?"
"17338100","17341240"," Yeah, the news today on..."
"17343880","17346360"," You're listening to Trade the News."
"17346620","17347680"," I make sure I'm still logged in. "
"17348260","17350440"," For spy calls, spy puts, spy calls at the same time."
"17351700","17352980"," It's got a low money, like 80 grand each."
"17359800","17360820"," It's kind of weird, too. "
"17361060","17368660"," Bitcoin hits four week high, last up 4.33%. And everyone says that we trade with Bitcoin, right?"
"17368660","17370120"," I guess that's not the case."
"17418240","17420120"," Chewy puts..."
"17420860","17427980"," There's the short CHWI, January 20th, 30p, $1.3 million."
"17439930","17440400"," Man. "
"17441500","17443600"," Just wrecking on Chewy, huh?"
"17446180","17450060"," When is there a 30p?"
"17455740","17456640"," Yeah, that makes sense."
"17457820","17458860"," Let's see, why not?"
"17461100","17462260"," It's not a bad play."
"17464300","17469720"," Chewy, January 20th, 2023, 30p, oof. "
"17471260","17477510"," I don't know why it's so far out one year from now."
"17478910","17482530"," If that's just a hedge for a long..."
"17484070","17486490"," Twitter, February 18th, 40p."
"17487930","17502090"," I think"
"17502090","17503290"," Twitter is going to have a good ER. "
"17530510","17532710"," Twitter's ER's before the open on Thursday."
"17563300","17564080"," Look at X."
"17564480","17565360"," X is like, I'm out."
"17568970","17570070"," Yeah, I like Twitter. "
"17570530","17572090"," I like what they're doing on Twitter."
"17573890","17575110"," They have more to do."
"17581930","17583050"," It's super oversold. "
"17588550","17590590"," They got a big hit from Facebook."
"17593390","17598090"," But if they show that they have more active users or they're growing their user base on Twitter,"
"17599510","17601470"," anything like that, anything more positive than Facebook."
"17602770","17603570"," New CEO. "
"17606550","17608610"," Nothing of a fan or anything but..."
"17617220","17618500"," Twitter might be one to watch."
"17618720","17624660"," Twitter might be one to watch like you watch it in the after hours."
"17625100","17627920"," If it gets a huge dip down below you grab it. "
"17628720","17655630"," I don't"
"17658540","17659720"," know, I don't think anything's falling off the cliff."
"17660120","17661880"," You know what looks like it's falling off the cliff is VIX."
"17675130","17676210"," VIX is looking bearish. "
"17680480","17681820"," You have a nice move up here."
"17693860","17695060"," Make it a nice push right here."
"17700610","17708050"," The idea of RTN seeing a report circulating that they're exploring possible sale from the adult in"
"17708050","17708370"," November. "
"17708710","17724930"," The Twitter"
"17724930","17728810"," account seems active, but honestly my first photo could put it on really straight dead."
"17742640","17744300"," Twitter has a..."
"17745600","17751660"," Twitter has an impression on saying that he and the determined Chancellor are in the lockstep on"
"17751660","17752880"," addressing the Russian aggression."
"17754100","17755450"," Twitter has an ability..."
"17755450","17758350"," That's speaking for the White House at a meeting with Schultz. "
"17760190","17762870"," There's almost a golden moment right now for Twitter."
"17766570","17769910"," With Facebook being utterly shit upon."
"17771850","17777990"," And then Reddit isn't a really weird place right now. "
"17778910","17787570"," It has a large foreign or based user, like active user base right now."
"17788150","17792470"," It's not a US based social media platform like it once was."
"17793230","17795470"," But the golden era of Reddit is almost over. "
"17796150","17800530"," The comment sections of Reddit have been astroturf."
"17803650","17805690"," Reddit is not the place that it once was."
"17805690","17808690"," Not that it shouldn't change over time, but it's become a place that's very weird. "
"17809990","17811410"," Very, very, very weird."
"17822390","17826430"," Spy calls February 7th, 449C, $144,000."
"17827610","17829570"," They're putting a nice push here. "
"17832010","17833330"," That fixes dying, right?"
"17834090","17834730"," Looks like it's dying."
"17837330","17838510"," Get a nice move here."
"17845420","17846700"," Yeah, it's astroturf. "
"17846880","17847380"," It's really bizarre."
"17847380","17853300"," I've been a Redditor since beginning, since the first year was ever Reddit."
"17856130","17857510"," But it's been astroturf. "
"17857690","17858170"," You'll notice it."
"17858370","17860490"," They collapse comments."
"17861150","17862270"," They get all kinds of issues. "
"17862590","17865270"," You need so much karma to get a new account holder."
"17865470","17867050"," It's brutal to get people to comment."
"17867910","17871330"," If you notice, it gets astroturf by companies. "
"17872570","17876410"," It gets astroturf by marketing campaigns, by political campaigns."
"17876410","17882130"," And even within their own cultures, within subreddits."
"17889070","17891130"," Even from community members. "
"17892450","17895230"," There's echo chamber, lots of echo chambering."
"17898430","17904590"," Also, the age group of users has gone down significantly in US users."
"17913370","17918030"," So I wouldn't say that Twitter is going to be a young user friendly. "
"17918650","17925130"," But the Facebook older user crowd doesn't really have a space if they don't have Facebook, right?"
"17925310","17926130"," So where do they turn?"
"17928390","17929630"," That doesn't mean that they turn to Twitter."
"17929790","17932870"," But Twitter could use that to their advantage and their guidance."
"17945600","17946540"," Oh, shit. "
"17947300","17948540"," Here goes the VIX."
"17949380","17950540"," Sitting on support."
"17951100","17951920"," What does it do next?"
"17953500","17954680"," What's going on, VIX?"
"17954920","17955540"," What's up, buddy?"
"17957540","17959640"," VIX is looking bearish. "
"17963320","17964360"," Super bearish."
"17968550","17970130"," Twitter is the best for breaking news."
"17971010","17975890"," Twitter has, if Twitter could be like, we're going to step into this vacuum. "
"17978110","17979070"," It could be clutch."
"17982410","17986710"," The only thing that bothers me is that they just totally faux pas how to make money."
"17987110","17989130"," But that still leaves me head scratching my head. "
"18000930","18002110"," It is getting shittier."
"18004030","18007190"," But for, they have their own problems."
"18008530","18017530"," People are like, well, Twitter is, people are like, Twitter is, um, they can't post whatever you"
"18017530","18017790"," want. "
"18018570","18020370"," Like, oh, you get banned or whatever."
"18020510","18023010"," Did you get banned on Reddit way faster than on Twitter?"
"18023830","18024530"," Way faster."
"18037760","18040540"," Getting a little bounce on VIX. "
"18041540","18042680"," Getting a little bit of support here."
"18042860","18082920"," But if it falls from here, if you"
"18082920","18090220"," look at most of the Facebook, you can pretty much say whatever you want on Facebook right to an"
"18090220","18090520"," extent."
"18091580","18093180"," I think, I don't, I'm not on Facebook. "
"18096480","18097260"," Any longer."
"18099720","18101900"," I haven't met on Facebook in a decade."
"18103420","18109640"," But I think between the two, Instagram is pretty, you can do whatever you want, but it's not as"
"18110880","18111760"," community driven. "
"18115500","18116660"," Twitter has a lot of potential."
"18123960","18126880"," Yeah, there's, the Reddit's turned into a fucking disaster."
"18127580","18129380"," No matter how you cut it, slice or dice it. "
"18129800","18130760"," It's a fucking disaster."
"18139940","18149890"," Even that, uh, even that the, the anti work subreddit, like I get"
"18149890","18150910"," the idea behind it."
"18151350","18152110"," You get it. "
"18153330","18156670"," But then you kind of know that it's, it's asked for a turf at the same time too."
"18158490","18159010"," Right?"
"18162290","18164890"," You're like, eh, that sucks."
"18172010","18173130"," Yeah, that was hilarious. "
"18173470","18174370"," I saw that Reddit mod."
"18175330","18176510"," But you know what the crazy part is?"
"18176610","18178870"," So there's like two bad parts to anti work."
"18179390","18185010"," There's a part of anti, I actually like the anti work subreddit, the concept of it. "
"18185330","18189970"," But then you find out who the mod is and you're like, what the fuck is that?"
"18190550","18194570"," Because you kind of know from some of what they talk about that, some guy like that or whatever."
"18195070","18202430"," And then you know some of it is definitely a foreign, uh, foreign influence, like, um, uh, foreign"
"18202430","18205910"," influence that wants to, uh, write up Americans."
"18206430","18212110"," That doesn't, that's not in any way shape or form to say, like workers are getting fucked over"
"18212110","18213370"," because they do get fucked over. "
"18213370","18222530"," But, uh, there's like, just follow forward influence in what they're trying to do, right?"
"18222790","18225010"," Try to create a dissent within our own country."
"18225570","18227810"," You kind of like to worry about who you're listening to."
"18230850","18237970"," Is it like a couple of the disgruntled American workers or is there, um, foreign influence in"
"18237970","18239210"," trying to stoke fires?"
"18243840","18245380"," Do you guys understand what I'm saying?"
"18254500","18257060"," Use Instagram for food, Facebook for market. "
"18257220","18258400"," Yeah, you know what I can't say?"
"18258460","18258860"," I don't use Facebook."
"18259940","18264220"," I do use Facebook for marketplace through a family member."
"18267930","18269590"," Yeah, Wall Street Bats wanted to shit too. "
"18269850","18273890"," Wall Street Bats has been car, or I don't know if you know that, but it's been asked for turf."
"18276050","18276870"," With a lot."
"18277910","18279590"," Wall Street Bats is a weird place now. "
"18281650","18282970"," Messick influence as well, right?"
"18283110","18284630"," Yeah, there's domestic influence as well."
"18284630","18285230"," I agree with that."
"18287230","18288930"," Right, it has become mostly prop again. "
"18289170","18290450"," It's bizarre place now."
"18290890","18294610"," A really bizarre place."
"18298090","18301970"," Oh, yeah, a little bit of a dip, a little bit of dipage here on the spy. "
"18305770","18308930"," And the VIX is dipping as well, which is interesting."
"18325190","18326170"," It's really bad."
"18333960","18336200"," Oh, yeah, it all changed. "
"18336660","18341000"," Like, there was a golden time for Reddit and Wall Street Bats."
"18342440","18344260"," There was like a golden window."
"18345100","18347000"," Across all of Reddit, there was. "
"18360800","18362280"," No shores of Missouri either."
"18363280","18364320"," Yeah, Discord's pretty good."
"18370350","18374250"," Ooh, SEC charges social media stock promoter with penny stock fraud. "
"18374410","18374710"," Which one?"
"18376110","18377350"," Gotta check that out."
"18377610","18378110"," Who got nailed?"
"18391070","18393130"," Mr. Zach Morris has entered the chat."
"18395810","18400130"," Who was it?"
"18400490","18400950"," Petty Pumper?"
"18402150","18403490"," Was it Nancy Pelosi?"
"18406030","18407130"," Was it J-PAL?"
"18418250","18419110"," Who is it?"
"18419730","18420590"," No one knows. "
"18433960","18435420"," No one's saying who it is."
"18444270","18446070"," Timothy Sykes, oh shit."
"18452240","18453940"," No one seems to know who it is. "
"18457690","18458470"," Jim Kramer?"
"18460750","18461970"," Too fucking funny."
"18469450","18470610"," Gotta be Zach Morris."
"18474650","18478900"," That was some wild shit from Zach Morris yesterday. "
"18499070","18502750"," I think it's just dead."
"18503770","18507850"," I just thought it's way just right back to this trend line."
"18513530","18516490"," It's just like climbed quad. "
"18516770","18524170"," It's way back to this trend line going all the way back from going all the way back from the"
"18524170","18524870"," 28th."
"18526350","18527670"," It's way back."
"18530130","18530950"," Telling me spy. "
"18537030","18537850"," Telling me spy."
"18543070","18544950"," What are you guys thinking of the clothes happens?"
"18545290","18547630"," I just want you guys to know we are running out of runway heading into the clothes."
"18548130","18549250"," There should be a move. "
"18549490","18552370"," We should get a move in one direction."
"18553470","18556530"," We are getting some more XLF calls right now."
"18556790","18560210"," XLF March 18th, 41C for $120,000. "
"18560210","18563870"," XLF March 18th, excuse me, February 18th."
"18564310","18565710"," Scratch both those dates."
"18566270","18567790"," February 18th, 41C. "
"18569530","18575270"," Two sweeps, basically for $150,000, $160,000."
"18576010","18579050"," That doesn't lend us to selling the market here."
"18580010","18581830"," Seeing all these calls coming in XLF. "
"18589400","18592180"," Yeah, date drinking does seem fitting."
"18594360","18596540"," I think we trade down."
"18597060","18601040"," Just be conscious of when you see other moves in the market, you see things like XLF calls and"
"18601040","18601680"," stuff like that. "
"18602080","18604440"," It does not lend itself to the market selling off."
"18608850","18610110"," Yeah, Friday was like this."
"18612710","18617670"," It'd be crazy if we traded sideways the entire week and slowly up. "
"18624180","18628660"," Spy, February 11th, 444P, $254,000."
"18633030","18634690"," Big money, Mike, 6."

"18704170","18704510"," recommendations."
"18705930","18707650"," I think that's what they always do, right?"
"18710470","18714010"," Beck engaged in scalping of eight different penny stocks for committing a stock without disclosing"
"18714010","18718690"," his intent to sell the stock and then selling it at inflated prices to generate profits, requiring"

"18736250","18737130"," Team Billionaire."
"18737830","18740050"," So they could receive a recommendation by email. "
"18740410","18744650"," The further complaint from us alleges that if it is for Beck Public to be the recognition, could we"
"18744650","18750030"," email the Team Billionaire members or had third parties post favorable commentary about the stock"
"18750030","18750410"," and investment."
"18751370","18754950"," As Beck then took it again to sell the shares and shares them by his mother."
"18755610","18756130"," Fuck. "
"18756670","18759130"," The previous complaint was to be sold."

"20962170","20963630"," We pointed that out this morning. "
"20963810","20965750"," They had more calls than any other ticker this morning."
"20967210","20968170"," More Spy calls."
"20968650","20972130"," February 9th, 452C, $148,000. "
"20974490","20976450"," Well, I might have to buy some more calls again."
"21085240","21093860"," Just to note that the Spy is breaking above resistance channel from a downward move"
"21093860","21098500"," going back to February 2nd."
"21100000","21166160"," Just adds"
"21166160","21169720"," up this is a pretty big move for the Spy here. "
"21180200","21183560"," 237, we've got more buyers and sellers."
"21184060","21188060"," We have the Hero Indicator trading very bullish at this point just to heads up."
"21216890","21221610"," Yeah, depending on how you count, if Mr. Wu's say or whatever his name is, Master Wu's saying 456. "
"21222450","21226950"," He's probably working the count where it goes to 456 and then it sells off heavy."
"21230890","21234530"," There's like three or four pretty consistent counts going on right now."
"21249220","21251740"," 238 PM Eastern Standard Time. "
"21256970","21262330"," You want to see if the Spy can hold this area here."
"21262570","21272070"," If they cannot, we are at"
"21272070","21274430"," 238 in the afternoon."
"21276290","21280370"," Trading on the upper bounds of a downward channel since February 2nd. "
"21281510","21291960"," The Spy calls of February 7th, 450C, $59 "
"21291960","21292760",",000."
"21294240","21302420"," Yeah, I think"
"21302420","21311360"," it's January 4th resistance is much higher."
"21312220","21320500"," I think they were not near that resistance yet. "
"21321320","21324620"," That resistance is at 454, 456."
"21325480","21330280"," There's a cow where it puts us out between like 456, 460 ish."
"21331280","21335140"," And then we should trade back down three test lows again. "
"21335920","21340380"," Unless we trade above 460, then there's a whole nother bullish count that brings us to all time"
"21340380","21341240"," highs right now."
"21342380","21344600"," There's like three to four counts going on right now."
"21346060","21348980"," It's like three bear counts and then one bull count. "
"21361320","21363180"," Let's see if the bulls can hold onto it."
"21379000","21380920"," Let's see if we can find a price target above."
"21385830","21387150"," Or if they put it into the close. "
"21395820","21397300"," Yeah, see if you get above here."
"21397400","21401720"," If you get above this 454, you're going to make a run for 460."
"21405560","21406380"," With some changes. "
"21419550","21421610"," With this move, let me know what you guys think we do here."
"21423750","21426630"," Yeah, I like Mr. Wu."
"21433200","21434860"," I think he follows Elliott wave. "
"21435680","21436720"," And I see him post."
"21437700","21442500"," I usually follow, I follow like three to four Elliott wave wave guys that all usually have"
"21442500","21443020"," different counts."
"21443860","21446800"," And try to take into consideration what they're pushing. "
"21450660","21453760"," I'll be honest, I don't feel like doing Elliott wave counts all day long."
"21455860","21459660"," I feel like you get sucked into the hole of believing in it too much."
"21461620","21465360"," But his numbers seem to match a couple of the counts that are out there pretty consistently. "
"21466600","21473940"," So then I think as a trader, as an investor, you have to kind of believe in or put more"
"21473940","21475820"," weight depending on where they are."
"21476300","21482300"," The only problem I've got with Elliott wave is that the time is usually fucked up and it's not"
"21482300","21483180"," accurate enough."
"21486750","21490490"," And then you have to take into a bunch of different counts, anyone who's counting. "
"21492510","21495070"," But I like to know where people are counting the Elliott wave."
"21497150","21499870"," I like to know where people keep their count or have the count set."
"21506600","21508080"," Here's a flexible Elliott waver. "
"21515130","21516530"," I do think we trade up here."
"21518270","21520730"," We could sell off here, but I think we trade up here."
"21520730","21522830"," I think we're here, we're up here, breaking them off. "
"21523890","21528330"," We wouldn't surprise them to see us either trade sideways in the bell or to trade higher into the"
"21528330","21528550"," close."
"21529210","21533430"," We are going to set up some short squeezes here because of where we are on the channel."
"21536590","21538930"," And, you know, four fifty eighty six. "
"21540370","21544410"," Right there, there's going to be some point of contention as well."
"21545650","21547170"," Watching Nvidia calls come in."
"21548310","21551810"," February 11th, 255 C for $500,000. "
"21552250","21555990"," Nvidia 211, 255 C for $130,000."
"21558150","21563870"," Spy calls February 9th, 450 C, $16,000."
"21564490","21566610"," Be careful here if you're a bear trying to make. "
"21566970","21570130"," If you're a bear trying to take a short right here, just be careful."
"21570330","21572070"," There is some money coming into the market."
"21572670","21574250"," That's unusual for today. "
"21574770","21576910"," A larger call volume than usual."
"21581760","21586220"," That doesn't mean we don't reverse here, but just be conscious of it coming in right now."
"21587560","21589600"," This does look like an attempt to squeeze higher. "
"21597500","21600400"," Sixteen minutes left until the three o'clock power hour."
"21601760","21603000"," Find out who's in charge."
"21604260","21608580"," You really do want to know before end of day who's in charge. "
"21608580","21615000"," And to be honest with you, we have traded back to where we opened basically this morning."
"21616160","21626140"," There was an implied move of 1.3%. The spy has moved 0.38%."
"21633220","21646620"," Yeah, spy"
"21646620","21653460"," calls February 11th, 450 C, $261,000."
"21653460","21659940"," Yeah, I'm still holding some put spreads, 42s, 40s for the 18th. "
"21660540","21663280"," And then I'm getting burned right now in some puts."
"21663580","21669120"," But I've been trading calls all day long, making that money back, trying to make the money back on"
"21669120","21669520"," that trade."
"21670520","21673020"," I'll probably be breaking even on the day. "
"21673800","21683790"," And then it took some put, I've took some just some puts"
"21683790","21687430"," or long, long puts protect myself."
"21688450","21689450"," It's just a day."
"21690650","21693290"," One of those, or two of those, three of those counts are very bearish. "
"21694310","21697270"," So in case we were to sell the entire market, I wanted to clean up on that trade."
"21698330","21699210"," It didn't happen."
"21699490","21702470"," So I've been trading the calls on this bottom down below here all day long. "
"21703270","21704230"," In and out of that."
"21704430","21709390"," One side 15 minutes down to the close of titrating in bond markets."
"21709590","21713570"," The 10 year yield at 1.909% is unchanged from Friday's close. "
"21713890","21719230"," The two year 1.286% for 210 spread of about 62 basis points or so."
"21738310","21739450"," You're pretty much looking for."
"21739710","21742630"," I want to see 545 20. "
"21744390","21745990"," I had a price target today."
"21747990","21751330"," I want to see right up here 45 20 into the bell."
"21774620","21775580"," We'll see if we get it. "
"21787260","21789140"," Yeah, it is based on market impulse."
"21789640","21790580"," I just don't like the extensions."
"21790940","21792560"," Like there's a constant extensions, right?"
"21792620","21793740"," It's like we're extending this way. "
"21793820","21794620"," We're going to extend that way."
"21794720","21795040"," And I'm like."
"21796540","21801180"," I feel like you're throwing a baseball bat side of a building and hoping that it hits. "
"21804780","21808760"," Yeah, I'm bearish until we cross for six with the breakout of our downward channel, right?"
"21809400","21810240"," You guys can't be."
"21810900","21813420"," Well, yeah, we already talked about that."
"21813560","21815100"," You guys know where I'm bullish and bearish. "
"21819430","21820710"," You guys know where I'm neutral."
"21846210","21852190"," If we can crack for 56 to 460 and we don't go over for 60."
"21852950","21855330"," I'll be throwing even more puts on for March 18. "
"21865600","21867560"," If we break for 60 and hold."
"21874810","21876910"," I'd consider not having any more putts."
"21876970","21882750"," You just get rid of putts and riding it up to probably 47472 somewhere in there. "
"21885110","21887610"," There was stalling going on in the spy right now."
"21889950","21891430"," Looks more like consolidation."
"21891810","21892230"," Can't tell you. "
"21897950","21900370"," You want to see a nice rejection off the VIX here."
"21901210","21902050"," We're going to trade higher."
"21934570","21935730"," Press X to doubt. "
"21937970","21939130"," No, I'm not doubting."
"21939330","21940250"," I think we trade up today."
"21941090","21942190"," As of right now, I do. "
"21945190","21946250"," Ten minutes until."
"21948150","21951810"," Until the power of power."
"21954510","21955670"," Be a nice dip by. "
"21960390","21961950"," That sweet sweet bit by."
"21962670","21971470"," I mean, I do see it dip by."
"21977080","21978640"," I want a dip by. "
"21998910","22001110"," That was nice call expansion earlier."
"22005920","22008140"," Keep your eye on the March 18."
"22008560","22012040"," 455 C's for 1.7 million dollars. "
"22012600","22014760"," As long as there's still interest in those calls."

"22123700","22125680"," the VIX to just shit the bed coming up here."
"22146150","22148530"," Can I see the VIX trade down to like 2172?"
"22149770","22151710"," I don't think it needs to go down to 20 bucks. "
"22153370","22154550"," Let's see if that happens."
"22156270","22161590"," VIX is in a bull flag."
"22163130","22165030"," There's a couple of support levels below it. "
"22171840","22174500"," It's going at 22, 15, and 2172."

"22253600","22255960"," We had a reversal hammer candle here."
"22257900","22260400"," See if we trade down and then up again."
"22260880","22267180"," Looking for a grab somewhere down on 449.23 if we trade down. "
"22271360","22276780"," If you look in the civil moving average in the 5 minute chart, it does look very fucking bullish."
"22276780","22277800"," It just heads up."
"22279020","22286600"," If you look at the civil moving averages in the 5 minute chart, everything is coming nice"

"23637210","23638090"," Channel here."
"23638410","23639690"," It is like a downward channel. "
"23641190","23643610"," You can just open up any Spy chart here."
"23645030","23646530"," There's this giant channel."
"23651090","23652810"," And it's a bull flag. "
"23653390","23656690"," Now we can have fake bull flags where we sell down."
"23657730","23661730"," Or we can attempt to go out of, break out of the bull flag."
"23662630","23664470"," And it fails or reject. "
"23665730","23667730"," At this moment we've traded above it."
"23667730","23668290"," Okay."
"23670400","23676550"," If we hold 450 into the bell, it is a bullish sign moving forward. "
"23678540","23680730"," That should take us to."
"23682410","23687650"," Well, it's a bullish sign technically we should be over 450 to zero."
"23689310","23691230"," And that should bring us up to. "
"23695500","23696630"," We've got a bunch of levels."
"23697730","23708250"," 43, 59, 45, 0, 46, 55, 48, 12, and 49, 460,"
"23708310","23708770"," basically."
"23712320","23715940"," We should reject somewhere in there and then trade lower. "
"23717260","23721640"," If we get over 460, you would take it higher to all-time highs."
"23724460","23729800"," Now, just based upon this into the bell, we can trade all the way back just heads up to like"
"23729800","23731360"," 450 or whatever."
"23731940","23734540"," We definitely want to close though up here. "
"23735220","23740540"," And you also want to pay attention to 446, excuse me, 446."
"23742320","23748440"," And statement here from Astra's base now saying confirming that they're standing down today due to"
"23748440","23751120"," a minor telemetry issue."
"23751740","23757220"," After a week and a session was attributed to the last second on board of the launching of one of"
"23757220","23757640"," its rockets. "
"23760310","23761770"," That was Astra, by the way."
"23762650","23772610"," So we are having a higher low today, 446.69 at this point than the previous close on Friday."
"23773250","23779270"," Now, we don't have a higher high versus Friday or as of yet we don't. "
"23779270","23788010"," We haven't closed higher than 456, but us breaking out of this channel here to put it into the"
"23788010","23788950"," neutral category."
"23789330","23792490"," We're not quite bullish, not bearish though right here."
"23792910","23798990"," We would really like to see like that lower low, excuse me, the higher low and then the higher high"
"23798990","23800270"," from Friday. "
"23800670","23803590"," But breaking out of this channel is not bearish."
"23803730","23805490"," It is a good look for the bulls."
"23805490","23810290"," So you're going to be looking, even though we have this giant reversal candle in the 5 minute here"
"23810290","23814610"," on the spy, we want to see where it closes here. "
"23814970","23822670"," If we can maintain above this channel and I'm going to be probably looking to buy some calls for"
"23822670","23823990"," those sneaky P things, right?"
"23824450","23826070"," We don't trade up into the bell here."
"23827030","23828810"," It's only 3.21, we got 40 minutes left."
"23829270","23834790"," But if we don't trade up into the bell, we kind of just trade sideways into the close. "
"23835490","23843460"," We're looking for some kind of cheap calls for Friday between 4 and 4.15. We'll have to see how"
"23843460","23844380"," we trade from here."
"23845080","23848960"," We could make another pump up into the bell, a sneaky peak pump."
"23849800","23855740"," If we just trade sideways into the bell here, we'll be looking to score some dirty cheap calls for"
"23855740","23856040"," Friday. "
"23859010","23859890"," Yeah, exactly."
"23860550","23861710"," Winky knows exactly what's up."
"23863390","23867790"," Buy him at $0.06. Sell him for $0.18 in 5 minutes. "

"25209570","25211190"," Right here, there it is right there. "
"25211710","25212970"," Is that white line down there?"
"25215270","25215710"," Gross."
"25217450","25217890"," Greed."
"25222420","25223340"," Yeah, I didn't short. "
"25224120","25225020"," I was looking to buy a dividend."
"25225200","25226980"," I'm like, nah, that's not the dip I'm looking for."
"25231240","25236280"," I think we do bounce right off that 4.46.80. That's my guess. "
"25238120","25241460"," It's right where that 4.46.70. We know there's liquidity here."
"25242120","25244020"," We know there's liquidity here."
"25246680","25248760"," You should see a nice fat ricochet. "
"25255920","25258380"," The IWM dip buyer is stepping in."
"25259740","25262800"," February 9th, 201C for 69."

"25270080","25275840"," Spy February 9th, 450C, $184,000. "
"25275840","25280360"," I'm also seeing you discuss challenges from China with German Chancellor."

"25284580","25289200"," IWM February 11th, 205C, $53,000. "
"25292470","25294050"," It could be one of those nice days."
"25294310","25297010"," It would be really cool if we just sold off into the close."
"25298410","25300170"," Just bleed right into the close. "
"25301070","25305990"," Bleed into like 4.15. You buy that last 15 minutes."
"25319040","25321560"," Bloodbath for any bulls and seller calls."
"25330080","25331680"," Can you imagine just having weeklies?"
"25333280","25334440"," You know, back in the day. "
"25334460","25336000"," I don't think the answer is saying the situation."
"25336700","25339380"," Ukraine is a very, very difficult situation."
"25340720","25343460"," You know, back in the day, you could buy a weekly on the spy. "
"25345400","25347680"," You just watch it print into next Friday."
"25348320","25350320"," These days buy a weekly."
"25350600","25352380"," You got to sell it halfway through the day. "
"25361250","25362790"," Let's look at the VIX real quick."
"25369270","25370250"," I don't know."
"25371650","25373710"," You got to turn around Tuesday tomorrow. "
"25375130","25377690"," Looking like spies looking pretty freaking shitty."
"25378530","25379230"," Dude, are you kidding me?"
"25380430","25380890"," 446?"

"25397890","25398890"," Did he buy the dip?"
"25401170","25403350"," Oh, that dirt bag bought the dip, didn't he?"
"25404190","25405270"," Look at him down here."
"25408490","25410390"," I drink your milkshake."
"25423590","25428410"," Oh, look at that. "
"25429150","25429750"," 447."
"25430350","25435010"," Within 30 cents, guys down there just pounding a milkshake."
"25435710","25436870"," He's like, I want it malted. "
"25437610","25438830"," No, I don't like vanilla."
"25439070","25439830"," I like French vanilla."
"25455050","25456830"," Son of a bitch looking him down here. "
"25457350","25458770"," He's like, I'm waiting all day long."
"25458770","25460230"," I'm bitching about waiting 40 minutes."
"25460250","25462870"," This guy's like, I'm waiting for this to come down here for the past 15 minutes. "
"25463470","25464270"," Come to daddy."
"25465710","25467030"," He's like, bring it to me."
"25470560","25471640"," This is terrible. "
"25473260","25474360"," Are we going to Beartown?"
"25474740","25475480"," Let me see."
"25475840","25480760"," Get some spy February 9th, 448 P for 344 K."
"25482900","25484440"," Let's zoom out a little bit."
"25485380","25486800"," It ain't looking good for the bulls. "
"25488480","25493850"," It ain't looking good."
"25496350","25502430"," Close below 446.47 is no bueno."
"25503850","25505630"," And it's an inside candle, right?"
"25509360","25511040"," Which is in decision, right?"
"25512120","25513660"," It's not looking good for the bulls. "
"25517880","25520180"," It's not looking good into this close."
"25527410","25532710"," Jesus, we almost tagged 446.80. It's tough to say."
"25533530","25536710"," Normally, my play would be buy this close all day long. "
"25546130","25552190"," Personally, this market is trading wild."
"25553450","25555490"," You know, someone just bought spy puts, right?"
"25555490","25560510"," February 9th, 448 P for $383,000."
"25561230","25569170"," Like at the absolute wrong time, the buy puts literally bought puts after the rundown of 446.97."
"25570730","25574750"," You must not have been listening to the broadcast where I told them where the fuck we were trading"
"25574750","25575290"," to, huh?"
"25585260","25590660"," Tell that guy the pot $500,000 and puts needs to tune in. "
"25597000","25601660"," Okay, so 446.94, we're within, we traded within 14 cents, right?"
"25602400","25607880"," We know there's buyers sitting down below there at 446.80. Can we trade lower?"
"25608300","25608320"," Sure."
"25608860","25611220"," But we do know that there's even now they're all showing up."
"25611420","25611900"," See them down here?"
"25612220","25615960"," 446.80. And these buyers were hidden down below here. "
"25617200","25620420"," They were sitting down here when we were way back up at 451."
"25621980","25623980"," Someone knew we were trading down here under the bell."
"25627430","25628110"," They knew it. "
"25628230","25629870"," They knew before we even started trading down here."
"25631050","25632550"," Was that a 60-point run or something?"
"25632710","25633110"," Not 60."
"25633370","25633650"," What was it?"
"25633970","25634370"," 461?"
"25635490","25637910"," A 40-point run down here or something crazy?"
"25639690","25640090"," Jesus. "
"25647820","25650280"," If you are bullish here, this is what I'll tell you, okay?"
"25650660","25655940"," If you are bullish into this bell, no matter where we trade to today, that's how we trade down into"
"25655940","25656680"," the bell."
"25656940","25659080"," So like all just bad."
"25660500","25662480"," Just say we trade negative into the bell. "
"25664200","25665060"," But you're bullish."
"25665700","25667040"," Then you could just grab some call spreads."
"25667660","25668300"," It's getting the money. "
"25669180","25671340"," Kind of expire on Friday or Monday and you should be good to go."
"25678340","25679640"," Give me that kiss on foot."
"25679800","25680580"," Oh, don't break it. "
"25681380","25682100"," Stay there."
"25682780","25683680"," Oh, this isn't good."
"25686060","25689740"," It just broke through 446.80. It is not pretty. "
"25697100","25697860"," Not pretty."
"25701150","25703210"," I got some fucking puts, by the way."
"25704130","25704830"," Not shouldn't you?"
"25713050","25717130"," The stock probing woes of the session here with about five minutes, a little more than five minutes"
"25717130","25717810"," to go to the close. "
"25718170","25719970"," The S&P futures are down half a percent."
"25720790","25722550"," The Dow is down 55 points."
"25732700","25734780"," You're just soul-crashing for a bull. "
"25736220","25737240"," Soul-crashing."
"25739440","25740400"," 446-13."
"25740460","25742500"," Also 2,000 still the bright spot. "
"25742880","25746960"," Today's trade up about four-tenths of a percent with the other major U.S. indices in the red."
"25750820","25753280"," Tesla trading down a 905."
"25755480","25755960"," Tesla. "
"25758800","25764560"," Okay, so this is where you buy the dip typically in Tesla, just so everyone wants to know."
"25764560","25766780"," This is where you typically buy the dip on Tesla."
"25769100","25771800"," Roughly down in this vicinity between 880. "
"25772720","25774940"," Not fun buying dips down here in Tesla, huh?"
"25775620","25779140"," Like 905 between 880 and 900."
"25779840","25782040"," It's kind of ugly buying dips down here, isn't it?"
"25783880","25784940"," Not fun, is it?"
"25791980","25792320"," Whew!"
"25793120","25793680"," Whew!"
"25794720","25800800"," So all you baller-ass bulls are like buying dips to be buying them when we're deep dark red bars."
"25805950","25808310"," Oh, look at that, 446-13. "
"25809230","25811910"," Just monster into the close, six minutes left."
"25813150","25813930"," Just disgusting."
"25816290","25817410"," What does this say?"
"25818650","25819590"," It's not good. "
"25820550","25822210"," I'm going to warn you something down here, okay?"
"25822470","25824150"," If we close down here, 446."
"25825370","25826650"," It ain't pretty."
"25828850","25829910"," It ain't pretty. "
"25832990","25834590"," You're targeting lows."
"25835830","25836790"," You guys really want to know?"
"25839050","25840810"," It doesn't aim pretty."
"25847260","25848260"," Shit, ready?"
"25850540","25851360"," Price target tomorrow. "
"25852720","25853240"," Not joking around."
"25855380","25862970"," 4.33.04. I don't know how long it takes to get there."
"25864050","25864850"," That's where we're headed. "
"25869990","25874530"," Facebook calls, February 11th, 225C, $658,000."
"25875490","25877570"," I don't know if I trust those calls right now, okay?"
"25877870","25884090"," We have to watch the bell today from 4 to 4.15. And see how nasty this can get."
"25884330","25888870"," I do want to warn you that this is going to get nasty. "
"25889950","25891450"," Oh, as of right now, it's going to get nasty."
"25894610","25896350"," Yeah, we've broken our..."
"25899990","25900930"," That's not pretty."
"25909050","25910270"," This looks like a failure. "
"25919290","25920490"," For technicals."
"25924480","25926600"," For technicals, we're not doing well."
"25928540","25935280"," They're going to tell you that there's some resistance at 4, 44, 4, and 4, 39. "
"25943570","25950530"," SQQ calls, February 11th, 38C, $488,000."
"25951350","25953010"," More Facebook calls."
"25953310","25954350"," It looks like we've got..."
"25954350","25960550"," Yeah, so Facebook calls, April 14th, 250C, $337,000. "
"25961010","25964470"," I think that's now about $1 million in Facebook calls."
"25967130","25969030"," Just getting smoked."
"25970270","25972150"," I think I didn't buy the dip. "
"25981630","25983810"," I don't know if it's a good time to buy calls yet."
"25984610","25986510"," We've got three minutes left here."
"25987350","25989490"," Watching some dip buyers on the spy. "
"25989970","25991370"," I'm going to buy that dip."
"25992790","25993990"," I'm buying that dip."
"25995010","25996390"," I'm going to take a chance on it. "
"25997050","25998310"," I do warn you, okay?"
"25998590","25999910"," You buy this dip here, right?"
"26000590","26001180"," Like February 9th."
"26002770","26003690"," Tell me what."
"26004110","26005230"," Super sketchy. "
"26005230","26010130"," Normally, moments like this, we bleed out one more day."
"26011010","26012410"," I don't think I'm buying this dip."
"26012850","26014570"," I'm going to cancel buying this dip. "
"26019460","26021280"," This is supposed to be support."
"26030810","26031970"," Tough call here."
"26033150","26036230"," We're supposed to be at support on 4, 44. "
"26041070","26043730"," With major support at 4, 39."
"26045490","26047230"," Dude, you could sell off into the morning."
"26047550","26049150"," 4, 39 would go with nothing. "
"26049470","26051730"," At 90 seconds, closing the bell on the earnings front today."
"26051910","26054070"," We'll get the engine in the first few minutes after the close."
"26055030","26056630"," Check about five minutes after the close. "
"26057490","26059510"," Simon, property, 10 minutes after the close."
"26059550","26061470"," We're going to have many buses, 10 minutes after the close."
"26061610","26063250"," We have to come back in the first few minutes. "
"26063470","26064710"," This is not the dip to buy."
"26065510","26067730"," There are technical reasons not to buy it."
"26067910","26072110"," There are reasons for, if we sold off that at 4, 39, right?"
"26074330","26077950"," So this is technically supposed to be a soft bottom. "
"26078650","26081130"," We could sell down in the overnight down at 4, 39."
"26082050","26082770"," No problem."
"26083650","26085210"," Then you'd be buying the open. "
"26086510","26087910"," Let's say we buy this close."
"26088230","26089550"," A lot of spy calls come in right now."
"26089910","26092170"," A lot of SPX calls come in right now. "
"26092230","26095750"," Spy calls when you grab this tomorrow and you lose it."
"26096390","26100650"," Even if it trades back to 4.50 tomorrow, you'd rather pick it up there than me."
"26100650","26102390"," Catch in these knives. "
"26104090","26106270"," So I'm going to be flat into the close here."
"26108710","26110030"," One more minute left in the bell."
"26112050","26113770"," I don't think this is that dip yet. "
"26114370","26122310"," We've technically brought, well, we ran out of runway as it's called."
"26127570","26130530"," Yeah, I'm not buying this bullshit at all, Miro."
"26130770","26131430"," It's lower, brother. "
"26131430","26135330"," And not only that, we're starting to fulfill one of the LEA waves."
"26135490","26136050"," That's very ugly."
"26141660","26143840"," Yeah, it doesn't matter if shorts are covering right now. "
"26144980","26146560"," It doesn't matter if shorts are covering."
"26149600","26154420"," This isn't the same market as 2021, 2021, 2020."
"26154740","26156200"," This is not the same market. "
"26158160","26159600"," Sorry, I'm not going to continue."
"26160540","26163040"," It's component MRO agreement with the MCO."
"26163220","26165280"," I can't ever go up fucking 50 points until you're running out. "
"26165340","26167360"," Still not the same market as it once was."
"26168320","26169240"," If the..."
"26169240","26172280"," Unburnt button knows what he's going to do."
"26176380","26178440"," Hell no, I haven't closed that putts reds. "
"26181340","26182060"," Hell no."
"26187210","26187930"," Hell no."
"26190410","26191950"," I believe in those putts. "
"26192450","26193670"," I believe in those putts."
"26193730","26193990"," I believe in them."
"26194590","26196370"," Earnings report, T-T-W-O. "
"26196550","26201030"," Nice little dip buy right here at 4.46. Support stepping in."
"26201950","26205810"," I still am not quite respecting this down here."
"26205910","26209950"," This is 4.46.09. If I see you're 4.10 million in revenue in the quarter. "
"26212550","26214090"," Except from through your 50.30. There are some."
"26214590","26215070"," Here you go."
"26215070","26216870"," Keep a little franklin room. "
"26216970","26226940"," Yeah, I can't"
"26226940","26227320"," buy that."
"26227580","26231700"," I can't buy it because we're breaking through some."
"26232500","26235080"," Well, it looks like we grabbed this. "
"26235780","26237640"," That closing bell just heads up."
"26238120","26239900"," We did swoop back up to."
"26242340","26244480"," The prior days. "
"26245560","26246240"," Trend."
"26247720","26251480"," So what we did was we came back and jumped above."
"26252160","26255820"," The two previous lows on the fourth. "
"26256560","26258900"," And our lower low we traded above it."
