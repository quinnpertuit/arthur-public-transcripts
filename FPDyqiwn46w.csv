"FPDyqiwn46w","173000","175000"," I have a lot of technical stuff I have to do"
"FPDyqiwn46w","175000","178000"," while trying to run the live stream as well"

"FPDyqiwn46w","180000","183000"," my other setup is not large enough to run everything"

"FPDyqiwn46w","209000","211000"," it's completely different"

"FPDyqiwn46w","265000","267000"," I guess if you wanted to you could say that"
"FPDyqiwn46w","267000","269000"," this is the window of weakness here"
"FPDyqiwn46w","269000","271000"," but you know you can't be at"

"FPDyqiwn46w","307000","309000"," for this window of weakness"
"FPDyqiwn46w","309000","311000"," due to"
"FPDyqiwn46w","311000","313000"," the options market"
"FPDyqiwn46w","313000","315000"," being untethered at this plenary"

"FPDyqiwn46w","321000","323000"," month the pin into end of month"
"FPDyqiwn46w","323000","325000"," should be higher"

"FPDyqiwn46w","443000","445000"," bears should look at and bulls should"
"FPDyqiwn46w","445000","447000"," look at that here"
"FPDyqiwn46w","447000","449000"," that is"
"FPDyqiwn46w","449000","451000"," that is important"
"FPDyqiwn46w","451000","453000"," it can't discount"
"FPDyqiwn46w","453000","455000"," a bear here"

"FPDyqiwn46w","461000","463000"," minute chart right now in SPX okay"
"FPDyqiwn46w","463000","465000"," and we should have some weakness"
"FPDyqiwn46w","465000","467000"," you can actually see we follow these trends"
"FPDyqiwn46w","467000","469000"," up right we follow these trends"
"FPDyqiwn46w","469000","471000"," down we follow these trends up"
"FPDyqiwn46w","471000","473000"," and we should have some down"

"FPDyqiwn46w","475000","477000"," okay"

"FPDyqiwn46w","485000","487000"," months yeah eventually"
"FPDyqiwn46w","487000","489000"," but does it make it today"
"FPDyqiwn46w","489000","491000"," does it make it this week while we're"
"FPDyqiwn46w","491000","493000"," while we're having ER season"
"FPDyqiwn46w","493000","495000"," while we have the largest fucking"
"FPDyqiwn46w","495000","497000"," reports coming out this week"
"FPDyqiwn46w","497000","499000"," and the answer to that is no"
"FPDyqiwn46w","499000","501000"," even if we sell into it"
"FPDyqiwn46w","501000","503000"," this is the thing too we talked about this last week"
"FPDyqiwn46w","503000","505000"," which was you can see more weakness"
"FPDyqiwn46w","505000","507000"," in tech but you still have"
"FPDyqiwn46w","507000","509000"," the S&P 500"
"FPDyqiwn46w","509000","511000"," includes you know"
"FPDyqiwn46w","511000","513000"," 15,000 tickers"
"FPDyqiwn46w","513000","515000"," that is not the four tickers"
"FPDyqiwn46w","515000","517000"," like Microsoft Apple and whatever"
"FPDyqiwn46w","517000","519000"," that and that shows"
"FPDyqiwn46w","519000","521000"," in the SP 500 should"
"FPDyqiwn46w","521000","523000"," should have less vol these four tickers"
"FPDyqiwn46w","523000","525000"," believe it or not shockingly you"
"FPDyqiwn46w","525000","527000"," might think that they are the only ones that hold it the SP 500 but they are not"
"FPDyqiwn46w","527000","529000"," and they did over perform"
"FPDyqiwn46w","529000","531000"," the S&P 500"
"FPDyqiwn46w","531000","533000"," the SP 500 I didn't actually go up to"
"FPDyqiwn46w","533000","535000"," to to to tap retest"
"FPDyqiwn46w","535000","537000"," all-time highs like like Apple did"
"FPDyqiwn46w","537000","539000"," there are believe it or not there's"
"FPDyqiwn46w","539000","541000"," a whole other part of this market"
"FPDyqiwn46w","541000","543000"," that trades"
"FPDyqiwn46w","543000","545000"," that trades separately from"
"FPDyqiwn46w","545000","547000"," those four tickers"
"FPDyqiwn46w","547000","549000"," and so even in here I want to show you"
"FPDyqiwn46w","549000","551000"," some things in here"
"FPDyqiwn46w","551000","553000"," but it is nothing for us to go up into"
"FPDyqiwn46w","553000","555000"," early May on good reports"
"FPDyqiwn46w","555000","557000"," and even just the"
"FPDyqiwn46w","557000","559000"," the ramp up"
"FPDyqiwn46w","559000","561000"," into ERs that are coming up"
"FPDyqiwn46w","561000","563000"," where you might see"
"FPDyqiwn46w","563000","565000"," more downside in tech specifically"
"FPDyqiwn46w","565000","569000"," you're not necessarily going to see it in the SP 500 just yet"
"FPDyqiwn46w","569000","571000"," okay so be wary"
"FPDyqiwn46w","571000","573000"," my point here is even though"
"FPDyqiwn46w","573000","575000"," we're on the high side here"
"FPDyqiwn46w","575000","577000"," to be wary there's a lot of talk last week"
"FPDyqiwn46w","577000","579000"," of a moment of weakness like"
"FPDyqiwn46w","579000","581000"," we're gonna start fucking crashing"
"FPDyqiwn46w","581000","585000"," this week right we're going to the depths of hell and all that kind of nonsense"
"FPDyqiwn46w","585000","587000"," follow my cursor down there"
"FPDyqiwn46w","587000","589000"," and that has not happened yet"
"FPDyqiwn46w","589000","593000"," has not happened yet"
"FPDyqiwn46w","593000","597000"," so just just but"

"FPDyqiwn46w","1893000","1897000"," and that's where your real sell the market"
"FPDyqiwn46w","1897000","1901000"," comes into play and even then the lows that you should be expecting"
"FPDyqiwn46w","1901000","1905000"," maybe 380"
"FPDyqiwn46w","1905000","1909000"," and a low somewhere down here 380 something like that and that's"
