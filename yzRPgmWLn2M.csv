"29190","36010"," Okay, now I have to go back and delete the other stream."
"39880","50890"," It's like sometimes some mornings it does not want anything to do with me."
"54530","57410"," Sometimes streamlabs is like, I want nothing to do with you. "
"58450","62230"," If you can see me right now, hopefully you can see me in stream right now."
"63910","64930"," Give me just a second here."
"64990","68830"," I've got some technical technical stuff going on in the background here. "
"72950","78010"," On Monday, if streamlabs takes a weekend off, it is not happy."
"79890","82350"," You give streamlabs a couple days off."
"82510","83430"," They come in on a Monday sometimes. "
"85050","86230"," It's all fucked up."
"88510","90250"," All the cameras are fucked up."
"90810","92630"," All they call my audio is dead. "
"94570","97610"," It is just like, sorry, redo all this."
"97850","99650"," Okay, let's do it."
"102740","109140"," And then trying to get live this morning has been the challenge of itself. "
"111080","111760"," Let's see."
"115420","117820"," This thing is fired up and going."
"118720","120060"," I guess that's enough time to read that. "
"122480","124820"," Subscribe is only any duration."
"126160","126600"," Save."
"130490","131210"," There we go. "
"131470","132410"," This right here, top chat."
"132630","133710"," We're going to go to live chat."
"135910","137430"," I apologize for that. "
"141490","143110"," Let's try this live stream again."
"151180","153560"," I don't know if it's that I don't stream."
"154000","160100"," In the weekends, if I take a couple days off, I come back in on a Monday and it oftentimes. "
"164980","169020"," Oftentimes, for some reason, streamlabs will reset itself."
"169420","180490"," Reset's all my cameras, resets, audio stuff, live"
"180490","181050"," stream."
"182230","183870"," The stream doesn't actually post. "
"184710","186170"," It like kicked me off this morning."
"187110","188510"," So we'll see how this one goes."
"188710","190270"," If we have any issues again this morning. "
"191790","195910"," If we have any issues this morning, if the stream ends or the stream health dies."
"196810","197850"," Something like that."
"198070","203270"," Well, I'll try to reset the router on the whatever the bucket is. "
"204250","204950"," Good morning."
"205150","206230"," Hope you all had a great weekend."
"207250","208770"," Everybody had a wonderful weekend here. "
"210870","214010"," I'm going to set up some stuff for you this morning."
"214010","221130"," I do want to let you know that there was a news piece this morning."
"221330","227850"," Traders are betting on a hawkish fed as may hike odds revert to 50%. "
"229770","234890"," On Monday morning, traders placed hawkish bets on Federal Reserve policy and secured overnight"
"234890","241210"," financing rate options and federal funds futures as implied by swaps."
"241210","248770"," The odds of rate hike at the U.S. Central Bank's May meeting rolls back towards 50-50."
"250630","260810"," And all I can think about is the nightmare that's become, you"
"260810","264230"," know, it's like the thing where they say, you know, always trust the bond market. "
"265690","271570"," And bond market is your best bet to what's, you know, like they're the smartest market, right?"
"271850","277530"," And yet the fed, spun rate futures are trading like a fucking penny stock, right?"
"277970","278810"," To some extent."
"280570","284750"," I mean, they're about as useless as tits on a bull right now."
"290950","292450"," Hold on a second here. "
"294930","296230"," No use at all."
"296770","299710"," Hold on here."
"301910","304490"," It is end of month, end of quarter as well. "
"305850","311950"," I'm not going to expect as much as some of you might be expecting this week."
"311950","314070"," I was wondering that."
"314250","317550"," I was wondering what your expectations were for this week. "
"318350","320930"," First thing to consider 39363."
"323750","331730"," You know, like summertime, like holidays in the summer months."
"332650","338570"," This week is, I've spent many of these weeks skiing. "
"340210","340930"," 39149."
"344330","347310"," Myself, and 29149."
"351110","355050"," And I know that the people that I've skied with. "
"356190","358430"," Are usually people with."
"360170","361690"," I'm trying to do here."
"363750","366650"," The people that I ski with are usually New Yorkers. "
"368230","370190"," They're usually, they usually make a lot of money."
"370350","371330"," They're usually from New York."
"371910","374110"," And it's usually out of place like Vale. "
"375070","376650"," And these people are."
"378230","378750"," 3149."
"380790","386210"," I've heard I always like when you'll hear like someone, someone who claimed that they work at a"
"386210","387150"," hedge fund and they'll be like. "
"388250","393490"," Everybody's been told to have their laptops open during this vacation."
"395390","396970"," I always find that funny."
"398810","400170"," I'm like you super cereal. "
"401390","403830"," But, you know, this week specifically."
"406290","408090"," A lot of people take vacation."
"408430","410570"," My point here is that you may not take vacation. "
"412290","413810"," But other people do."
"414310","417210"," Like people with real jobs, real lives, families, all kind of stuff."
"417770","420010"," It's one of those times of the year where. "
"421030","424850"," I'm not going to expect as much as you might be expecting out there."
"425630","426750"," This coming week."
"426750","429010"," I'm going to expect some positioning. "
"430070","431010"," 37 22."
"435020","438900"," Now we do have we are unbounded at this point."
"439740","445000"," I guess I should say that is that we are bound by the we can move more due to the"
"445000","445360"," options. "
"446100","449400"," Market here heading into the end of the end of month and quarter."
"449820","453440"," But typically in the quarter, I'm not looking for anything too crazy like."
"453440","458200"," Crazy town stuff like we're going to burn the three six 3600 something like that. "
"459900","469640"," 35.05. All right, we got some"
"469640","470620"," movement here though, right?"
"474230","478490"," And we'll talk about the triggers where those are and we'll talk about."
"480450","481790"," Positioning for the next quarter."
"482070","483630"," That's going to be a big one for us this week. "
"485150","486070"," Let's see here."
"487770","490650"," Our one 39793."
"495580","496480"," Right there. "
"496620","497020"," Good enough."
"499660","504800"," And we also have something fascinating to talk about today, which is a four hundred ten."
"511140","512080"," Right there. "
"514520","517900"," How bullish we are right now heading into this end of quarter."
"517900","519620"," We're very bullish here."
"520460","523320"," Four or four thirty seven. "
"531140","532340"," Right there."
"535100","537420"," We're going to talk about triggers right now."
"538400","540780"," Let's do some triggers for everybody. "
"546150","548380"," This is where the keys lie right here."
"549340","550200"," 36."
"550200","550860"," 36. "
"555300","556140"," Come on now."
"559100","560260"," 396 36."
"562720","564560"," It's your daily trigger right here. "
"564740","566740"," This is kind of like a key thing for you."
"567500","568920"," All right, this is your daily trigger."
"570240","572500"," When price is above the daily trigger. "
"574260","575180"," We're bullish."
"575720","576240"," We're supportive."
"577180","579180"," And you buy dips. "
"579660","581640"," That's a very key thing to understand here."
"582340","587240"," Now, the most bullish would be when the hourly trigger is above the daily trigger."
"587500","592340"," When you see this line above here, it's the most bullish. "
"592800","595640"," And I've shown you tickers with this configuration."
"596820","602580"," NVIDIA Apple all showed you similar setups where Tesla did not."
"602580","607580"," And you saw the runs that those tickers went on the past couple of weeks. "
"609020","614020"," Now, the daily trigger currently sits below or the hourly sits below."
"616760","622360"," The hourly is at 395.49. So it's right down here."
"622460","623340"," It's got some work to do. "
"623620","632460"," The 396.37. There's the daily trigger there."
"633000","635820"," And we've got the monthly just kind of kicking around in here."
"638000","642380"," We are seeing for sources that the Biden administration is expected to make a final offer to Mexico"
"642380","645520"," and negotiators and are hoping to break the energy dispute stalemate. "
"646040","652380"," So the Biden admin are to request a USMCA dispute panel if Mexico rejects this final offer, again,"
"652440","653020"," according to sources."
"654500","656240"," Very emotional level here."
"656540","657580"," This daily and weekly trigger. "
"657720","659480"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"659480","666320"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"666840","669620"," And there's a gap to fill down below here."
"669840","671380"," You know, part of the overnight last night. "
"672400","676380"," When we were blasting up last night, I'm like, man, I'm like, if we fucking, I mean, if we open"
"676380","679180"," too high, we're going to come back down and have to close all this shit anyways."
"680320","685040"," One of the things that have been pretty common place this."
"686820","689240"," Ever since like 2020. "
"691100","692800"," We were leaving behind gaps everywhere."
"693160","696040"," It was like, it was like, fuck the gaps will come back for them."
"696560","698180"," Twenty one, twenty one was the same way. "
"698420","701680"," Just leave gaps behind to fill on the regular."
"702480","706120"," This we haven't that we've been closing gaps like mad men."
"706280","708280"," Like we're closing gaps all the time. "
"708320","710020"," We don't leave a lot of gaps behind right now."
"710420","713260"," The markets been more efficient than it has been in previous."
"714980","715400"," Environments. "
"716060","720380"," And so my thought this morning was to I had two thoughts first on the overnight."
"720380","720960"," I was like."
"721920","725840"," Well, we're going to want to come back for the daily and the early at some point. "
"725960","726760"," I'll show you that this morning."
"727980","732440"," But also the more gaps we leave behind the more messy it gets."
"732500","735280"," So if you are a bull out there, some bulls are pissed off. "
"735420","737280"," They're like, why is it rolling over?"
"737400","738220"," This is early this morning."
"738400","739140"," I was trying to buy some."
"739140","744000"," Some bank tickers at four AM and people were all upset that we were coming back. "
"744840","748180"," And the truth be told, you don't you really do want to come back."
"748360","751180"," You don't want to be opening up three percent."
"751540","753420"," You know you're going to come back to fill all that shit in. "
"753840","756140"," I guess if you're holding calls over the weekend, you want it open."
"756540","758140"," So some short term bullishness."
"759220","762160"," Maybe just be aware of what people are saying to you on the internet. "
"762900","767320"," But if you're bullish here, if this stuff gets cleaned back up."
"768300","772240"," It's actually a good good for a positioning point of view."
"773160","776900"," Now, another thing is on yesterday's or Friday's close. "
"778180","784200"," I talked to you about when we're closing up here to be looking for a four oh five."
"784200","786260"," I think I said four oh five four oh three."
"788260","793860"," Four oh five four oh three put spread into Friday of next week with a with a with a with"
"793860","795640"," a date for the 31st. "
"796580","804560"," That even if we trade up higher here, that we should still get a role in magnet lower before Friday"
"804560","805280"," of this week."
"806480","808540"," That seems to still be on the table."
"808540","812340"," If you're looking to reposition here at some point, if you're in one of those put spreads, you're"
"812340","814800"," like, yeah, I'll just break even here in case we go higher. "
"815980","817900"," There is a case to go higher here."
"819160","825720"," But the options market is not is us ask semiconductor firms to submit chips act according to the"
"825720","826380"," Wall Street gem."
"826940","831360"," The options market is not not set up for us to go higher here. "
"831780","833080"," The options market is pretty much."
"834860","839780"," It's kind of like a call it like we shoot higher and then just we get dragged back down is"
"839780","842540"," there's a magnet below us trying to say no, you can't go up there."
"842540","846360"," So without an options market just expanding to the upside. "
"848040","853440"," We're likely going to trade a zone or a range and a tent and then we're going to get hit"
"853440","856300"," with a bunch of vegging into the 31st."
"857660","859500"," That's going to knock us off the block as well."
"871080","873440"," So let's see what you guys are saying here. "
"873920","875000"," Good morning, by the way."

"945540","946400"," I'm like, this is the Bronx."
"952920","953700"," Red on, brother. "
"956380","957120"," Warren, you've entered."

"976040","976700"," Hold on."
"976760","978080"," Let me get this thing in here for you."
"980830","982550"," We're going to take a look at a."
"984610","986550"," We're going to take a look at. "
"995090","995950"," Inside here."
"1005020","1006220"," Come on here."
"1016420","1016940"," Okay. "
"1021030","1023050"," I got some wonkiness going on."
"1024890","1027089"," I've got some serious wonkiness."
"1027230","1028710"," I've got resets going on. "
"1041240","1044280"," You can see the daily is improving here."
"1045200","1050200"," The hourly turning down a little bit on the hourly."
"1050800","1051520"," Five minute. "
"1053600","1055580"," I'm going to go with bearish."
"1055780","1058380"," Personally, I'm going to go with bearish right now in the spy."
"1061060","1062220"," I'm bearish here in the spy. "
"1062440","1063060"," I want to see a pullback."
"1066930","1067970"," Let me look on the."
"1070310","1073390"," I guess I'm saying bearish, but I need to look at some more stuff here. "
"1077280","1079340"," Five and fifteen minutes looking pretty good."
"1080020","1081040"," The half hour."
"1082640","1084060"," Yeah, I guess I am bullish here. "
"1085060","1093770"," I'm a little bearish on the morning open."
"1093770","1095470"," I'd really like to see."
"1096510","1097410"," On spy. "
"1099310","1102610"," Is at least some time some consolidation."
"1104610","1106010"," I'd like to see this."
"1107710","1110650"," I guess I should say I'm bearish right now. "
"1111730","1113930"," But overall, I'm bullish here."
"1117420","1121580"," Maybe some more consolidation and then some kind of a face ripper here."
"1122120","1124980"," I want to be looking for a three ninety sevenish. "
"1127020","1129040"," Three ninety seven fifty somewhere in here."
"1129820","1130900"," Something to buy here."
"1133060","1134520"," Worst case scenario. "
"1135800","1137540"," I have two other levels for you."
"1137900","1141800"," Three ninety six thirty eight and three ninety five fifty one."
"1141900","1142760"," I don't think we get that low. "
"1143660","1145620"," I think the market is supportive here."
"1146520","1152640"," I'd like to buy a dip down here if possible."
"1154120","1155800"," We might not even get there. "
"1164020","1166440"," I guess I can see why you're all pulled up this morning."
"1173960","1176140"," In the one minute we've got a bearish cross here."
"1177320","1178080"," So you can see it. "
"1180360","1183520"," I wonder if you're all are you all out there buying calls already?"
"1183720","1185200"," I'm not I'm not bullish here."
"1186060","1187320"," I'm a kind of bearish here."
"1189440","1190820"," You can see it right there. "
"1194240","1195420"," It's just the one minute."
"1204270","1205310"," In the five minute."
"1211620","1212920"," There's that gap down here. "
"1214800","1217720"," I bet you there's some fucking bears out there right now."
"1217880","1218180"," They're like."
"1219060","1219780"," It's on a five minute. "
"1219880","1220620"," The bears are like."
"1221100","1223960"," I'm going to trap the fuck out of these bulls."
"1225680","1227960"," Bears are like they don't even see it coming. "
"1230640","1231920"," There it is right there."
"1233300","1236520"," So you get like a bear or a bull to commit and try to buy a dip."
"1237620","1239440"," It's like a double bull trap or something. "
"1240460","1242160"," It's like double D double B."
"1244240","1245700"," T double bull trap."
"1247280","1250480"," So we're like you can you like do do do do I'm safe bull."

"1266360","1268180"," So you get like the bull buyer right here. "
"1268300","1270200"," He's like yeah I'm just going to buy this for off the bell over here."
"1270300","1271760"," Leave by this giant gap down here."
"1272120","1272440"," Trapped. "
"1273460","1277080"," Oh yeah I'm going to I'm actually going to wait for this one down here."
"1277500","1277820"," Trapped."
"1279640","1281000"," The bloodbath ensues. "
"1283260","1284740"," I don't think we have that though."
"1284920","1286080"," I don't think we have the double bull trap."
"1286280","1286460"," I think. "
"1286940","1291000"," I think it's so far so far."
"1292320","1293920"," I'd like to see this gap get filled."
"1298720","1302500"," These fucking bears never never never never ever. "
"1305180","1307780"," We'll see if they can saw if they can roll this over right now."
"1307780","1309440"," They kind of have one more chance don't they."
"1311940","1314140"," It's kind of like bears last chance right here. "
"1323830","1325590"," Oh yeah dude look at look at."
"1331170","1334530"," You're not going to get you're not shaking me out of FRC."

"1349380","1351520"," You're not shaking me out of FRC now."
"1369180","1371640"," Yeah there's a there's a there's a bull trap here. "
"1371780","1373420"," Are you guys long puts right now?"
"1374680","1375680"," Oh there it goes."
"1379420","1380700"," It's right there."
"1382780","1386940"," There it is. "
"1391220","1393200"," Oh wait it goes back down there."
"1393200","1396480"," There it is right there."
"1396720","1397400"," There's the bull trap. "
"1401000","1402200"," Too funny."
"1404840","1406760"," Surprise that mother effort."
"1409500","1411500"," Take a cat jumping out of the tree. "
"1414920","1419900"," Like cat jumps out of the closet and just jumps on your shoulders and starts taking its closet."
"1426320","1433070"," What up here."
"1442010","1442830"," Easy B."
"1442950","1444070"," So bro. "
"1454910","1464740"," Looking now to the fear and greed index someone slammed the cell button and the"
"1464740","1467880"," fear and greed index 64 out of 100 indicating greed."
"1467880","1468100"," read."
"1468480","1472560"," We'll show you more comments from ECB Centeno says we must be patient on the policy transmission. "
"1473900","1476060"," Yeah, my book back's working fine this morning."

"1491180","1491520"," you, right?"
"1492860","1494580"," There's the bear to, or there's the bull trap?"
"1494980","1495460"," Surprise!"
"1496940","1501500"," ECB Centeno says we don't see signs of second-round effects on wage settings. "
"1502520","1506660"," There's a, I just don't know how bearish it is."
"1507120","1510540"," So still haven't closed the gap here."
"1510660","1511600"," There's a gap down here. "
"1512560","1514340"," 396.79 it's developing."
"1516380","1523480"," One thing about these weeks is that, or the thing about this week for me at least after this"
"1523480","1532770"," weekend, so like on Friday or Thursday Friday into today's open, if we weren't at end of quarter,"
"1533150","1538770"," I would have came in today, into today and been like, bye bye bye bye bye."
"1539090","1540090"," Like, bye bye bye bye bye. "
"1540270","1540910"," Just bye bye bye bye."
"1543070","1544330"," Everything here is bullish."
"1544650","1546370"," Everything here is, we're going higher. "
"1548150","1553890"," Smells like super bullish, but just being end of quarter, I'm suspect of it."
"1554170","1559710"," ECB Centeno says wage increase is still compatible with monetary policy, but now 10 minutes away"
"1559710","1563190"," from the bottom of the hour, what would you get the Dallas Fed manufacturing business index?"
"1563590","1566450"," Who can ask minus 10 prior minus 13 spot five?"
"1566730","1570550"," I'm not so much, I'm not so much suspect of it in terms of like we can't go there."
"1571290","1572870"," I'm a suspect of it being end of quarter. "
"1573190","1575050"," I'm like, yeah, I like the setup."
"1575310","1580290"," I like, are they going to take the entire week to make this run?"
"1581070","1586270"," Kind of like we trade around and people get, or do their positioning, and then we actually make"
"1586270","1589550"," the, so like the, let's the setup is there, but you're just early to do it."
"1591450","1594070"," Can the market just blast higher this week?"
"1594330","1600050"," Probably, but it would need like a, it would need, it would need a bunch of stuff to happen"
"1600050","1602250"," mechanically in the background. "
"1610730","1611470"," Thanks, Minky."
"1611570","1612150"," I appreciate it."
"1613710","1615530"," You kind of saw this setting up, right?"
"1618060","1627740"," And there's a larger bear, not cross, but kind of almost tagged it here. "
"1627740","1629120"," We're pretty bullish here, too."
"1629600","1631760"," I got to say to you, we're, we are bullish here."
"1631960","1632860"," We're not bearish. "
"1634100","1637380"," I just would like to see this gate."
"1638120","1641920"," I would just like, I don't know that we get this, this, this closed, they either."
"1646570","1648290"," This is the 15 minute chart here. "
"1662460","1667420"," Yeah, I mean, so everything is set up on everything is bullish here."
"1668240","1669360"," Today's opens bullish."
"1669540","1670720"," Like the, the daily is bullish. "
"1672100","1674880"," The four hours bullish, the one hour is bullish."
"1675420","1679560"," Under normal circumstance, they'll be like, get out of it the way we're gonna, we're gonna replace"
"1679560","1681080"," some faces off here."
"1682260","1690320"," The only, the only thing here I would like us to get closed is that gap. "
"1690660","1692020"," There's a small gap down below."
"1692820","1694280"," We could leave this behind."
"1694540","1697920"," There's nothing saying we have to close this gap down here because we are so bullish here. "
"1698600","1700360"," We could be in a trend day situation."
"1702260","1703440"," We just leave it behind."
"1703740","1710380"," So if there's bear or bulls out there that are saying, I'm bullish here, this is what I'll tell"
"1710380","1710600"," you. "
"1710740","1714500"," If you're bullish here, and we're gonna leave this gap behind, zoom it tight."
"1715520","1717520"," Okay, so see this gap right here."
"1717520","1722240"," If we're gonna leave this gap behind, if we are, the only two charts you're gonna need is the one"
"1722240","1722840"," in the five minutes. "
"1723300","1733260"," The five minutes specifically, if price is able to get above $3.98.05 and hold above $3.98.05,"
"1734560","1739300"," we will trend higher on the day and possibly the next few days."
"1739980","1742520"," I mean, maybe in the week, we could, we could make some moves higher."
"1743540","1752540"," Now on the one minute chart, this is where it would begin to develop $3.97.86, but then don't"
"1752540","1758100"," forget, we've got the $3.98. So if you're trading the one minute, you would want, I'm gonna show"
"1758100","1759380"," you what price actually you'd want to see. "
"1759480","1771950"," You'd want to see something like this, something like"
"1771950","1781790"," this, and then you'd want to see price, not just wind here, but you'd see"
"1781790","1786830"," price come up and more than likely get a new high here, but then it would come all the way"
"1786830","1789070"," back down to just check again."
"1789870","1792010"," It doesn't necessarily have to get the new high there."
"1792230","1793150"," Sensiness is transmission. "
"1793910","1799610"," You'd want to see the validation on the one in five minute on a one minute chart to go higher."
"1801670","1804010"," And of course, you want a new high in here too, right?"
"1804970","1806730"," But this would be the development of it."
"1806870","1807750"," This is only one minute. "
"1809030","1813690"," Now, that's how you would validate it."
"1814130","1818950"," On a five minute chart, you would want to see the same thing."
"1821810","1824470"," This is a little bit more complicated here. "
"1825390","1834810"," You want to see price get above $3.98.03. And this is why we switched to trading a five"
"1834810","1838250"," minute chart, because it slows everything down."
"1838570","1844610"," Until you see price get above that white line, you can't really take a trade with confidence as a"
"1844610","1845050"," bull here."
"1845570","1852010"," So if you're looking for that trade as a bull, the magic number for you right now is the white"
"1852010","1852230"," line. "
"1852390","1854170"," It's right now $3.98 now."
"1854270","1855150"," It's just $3.98 flat."
"1856330","1859890"," It's been our five minutes away from the bottom of the hour, where we get the Dallas Fed"
"1859890","1864990"," Manufacturing Business Index forecast minus 10 on the prior minus 13 spot five. "
"1865850","1872550"," So until you see that, there's no trade for you as a bull, but it's $3.98 in change."
"1877090","1878550"," Yeah, that's what it personally."
"1879950","1892010"," I'm hoping for this gap that I close down here, $3.96.52, $3.96.55. So"
"1892010","1893270"," if you can't see that gap, great. "
"1893770","1900510"," If you want to take a long call, it's currently have to be priced as the above $3.98. That's"
"1900510","1901250"," on a five minute chart."
"1903170","1913090"," On a one minute chart, the price is still not above the $3.98, $7.81. That bear plane is"
"1913090","1914330"," still playing out above here."
"1914330","1915890"," It's supposed to be monitoring financial market tensions. "
"1917810","1919210"," There's your bear plane right there."
"1919590","1922530"," And that's that we have tools for whatever it takes action for banks."
"1926090","1935990"," If you are a bear and have a bear put, if you have a put a spread"
"1938330","1945310"," on, you put spread on for Friday, and we do get down here and close this gap down here, and"
"1945310","1949590"," you feel like we have a potential of ripping faces off here. "
"1950030","1953270"," This would be a place to take profit before it's going to break even or something."
"1953790","1957950"," If you're a transfer that we're not going to come back down here again this week, this is a place"
"1957950","1960510"," for you to manage that trade."
"1962010","1967510"," Maybe you cut the put side loose and just hold on to the long or the sold put side of"
"1967510","1967890"," that trade. "
"1971620","1972820"," Surprise, bitches."
"1974700","1977060"," Cap has made the said candy call in the past."
"1978880","1980460"," Anything systemic right now. "
"1990440","1991900"," Give me just one second here."
"1992020","1993880"," I'm going to take a two minute break."
"1994040","1994700"," I forgot some stuff. "
"1994840","1995340"," I'll be right back."
"1995500","1996040"," I'm going to grab some."
"1996300","1996680"," I'll be right back. "
"1999660","2000980"," Just here's your PT."
"2001380","2001760"," Hold on a second."
"2004780","2007040"," Let's do a PT down here for you. "
"2007800","2008560"," Just gap bill."
"2012400","2013760"," It's all I'm looking for down here."
"2014700","2015460"," Gap bill. "
"2015780","2017620"," Maybe a tag of the daily trigger."
"2018360","2019980"," Just want to see the gap bill get done."
"2021140","2021760"," If possible. "
"2094820","2095699"," One minute remaining."
"2127260","2130520"," All right, some weakness in the spy right now."
"2130760","2131820"," We had a bear plane above. "
"2134440","2135820"," Trade 397 22."
"2141570","2142350"," 10 seconds."
"2149170","2151130"," Come on get this gap bill down below. "
"2162340","2165140"," Minus 15 spot 7 minus 15 spot 7."
"2165400","2167100"," That is lower than the forecast of minus 10."
"2171600","2174420"," This is a place for you to manage your put spreads."
"2178030","2195690"," Capture gains on one side and ride the other"
"2195690","2198770"," there were people that black calls this morning. "
"2199750","2201270"," I'm looking on the options chain."
"2201370","2203310"," I'm like people black calls right on the opening bell."
"2203910","2210430"," A whole bunch of gaps down here to just burn through right here. "
"2210470","2211690"," We'll follow my cursor down here."
"2212610","2215270"," It's a nice gap filling to be done down here as well."
"2217750","2220550"," I didn't know people were buying calls off the opening bell. "
"2224270","2225550"," He's pulls don't care."
"2225890","2229510"," I think he puts them on fence with it's like just let it open up and breathe."
"2231230","2232470"," Just let it breathe. "
"2235530","2240080"," Just let it breathe."
"2240280","2243100"," I says banking problems have to have an impact on our decisions."
"2245180","2248320"," I want to buy some calls though now personally. "
"2257650","2264580"," I'm looking at them."
"2265500","2269920"," It turns negative after a raising opening gains."
"2274260","2276020"," Close some of these gaps right here please. "
"2283270","2284710"," Oh yeah there we go."
"2292660","2293440"," It's a prize."
"2293780","2294900"," I'm an effort. "
"2301990","2304970"," Yeah Phil we still have some more gap pull bullshit down here."
"2305090","2305670"," There's a little bit more."
"2305870","2307010"," We're not quite done here. "
"2307870","2308330"," Come on."
"2308630","2312110"," If you're going to come down here you might as well take it all."
"2312110","2313790"," Down us Fed Manufacturing activity. "
"2313830","2315930"," March reports on the feed for those interested."
"2339660","2341460"," See you guys are saying in the chat here."
"2347450","2348570"," It's Willem's birthday. "
"2351810","2354490"," Willem's saying it's my first of all Willem."
"2355450","2356970"," Happy birthday my brother."
"2357190","2366930"," He says the size of the rate hike increments will depend on data but it's clear that we need any"
"2366930","2372930"," puke happens this week and it better come quick because MMS will be window dressing to preserve"
"2372930","2374390"," bonuses at an quarter. "
"2375230","2380630"," Last year the puke happened on 4-4 and raged downward for months."
"2382850","2392610"," Yeah they like so it's interesting because like April like March like April's a tough month"
"2392610","2398710"," to April's typically our best month of the year."
"2399750","2404850"," I always I mean not always but oh it looks like we've got some more. "
"2405350","2406910"," We've got some more gaps in here too."
"2407050","2407890"," We're still not double gaps."
"2408110","2409230"," I don't know why they're not showing themselves. "
"2410350","2412990"," We have gap pills all the way down to right here."
"2413350","2417110"," 396 26 is showing some gaps too."
"2417330","2418690"," Yeah I guess we have more gaps don't we. "
"2419330","2420510"," Now that I'm looking at it."
"2423670","2426750"," Oh yeah we can go all the way down here."
"2428090","2429090"," Maybe we go to 396. "
"2431850","2434510"," I guess there's some gaps down here depending on how you look at things."
"2438920","2443020"," There's some there's some there's some hanky-panky if you look at a five-minute start."
"2444120","2446540"," You're like yeah what's the closing price from yesterday. "
"2448920","2451820"," To the one-minute final the Friday closing price."
"2466470","2469130"," Somewhere in there there's the low from Friday."
"2471550","2473150"," There's a couple of lows down here. "
"2476290","2477150"," Hold on here."
"2481350","2482190"," Down there."
"2482530","2483310"," No that's not really. "
"2485190","2486010"," That's the low."
"2491070","2496150"," Yeah I can see bears wanting to claim that they're going to give it all back or something."
"2507800","2511480"," Maybe because a bunch of gap pills in here still need to be filled. "
"2513420","2516920"," This is uh this this uh h-line right here."
"2517260","2522980"," This is the close Friday close down at 395 75 the hourly down here."
"2531300","2540670"," I should expect to squeeze here we are on the daily trigger. "
"2541930","2543910"," Expect some kind of a squeeze right now."
"2544390","2549810"," A little bit more gap to fill down below here still hiding it's right in here."
"2554460","2557420"," Uh yeah you're not going to slice through the daily trigger either. "
"2557660","2560900"," You're not just going to like blast through like it's nothing."
"2561960","2565480"," Now you're going to see like a rejection and then you're going to need some more work to get down"
"2565480","2567040"," here and try to nail that hourly trigger."
"2577600","2578560"," Yeah you're welcome Will. "

"2987960","2993120"," going to do this this week this week we're going to talk about a bunch of planning for end of"
"2993120","3000180"," quarter regardless of where the market goes let's take a look let's take let's talk about xlf so"
"3000180","3005100"," last week we talked on friday if you missed uh winky if you weren't here on friday we went all"
"3005100","3017960"," over xlf uh in detail in the morning and friday um but we did not address this last friday so"
"3017960","3027960"," xlf uh giant gap down here in shocker now let's tell about xlf so friday we talked about xlf"
"3027960","3034960"," in depth about and we actually showed in historically how when we're rotating cycles cyclically xlf"
"3034960","3044840"," does not perform for months now um this doesn't mean that on a smaller time frame"
"3044840","3053980"," that let's say we sell xlf into earnings week normally when you're selling first of all this is a"
"3053980","3062720"," just a generalization when you're selling a ticker or a sector into their earnings there usually is"
"3062720","3070860"," a moment just before their earnings or after they report where we get a squeeze on a higher time"
"3070860","3076280"," frame though that's still not might not show itself to be the biggest and biggest move that you"
"3076280","3080740"," might think that it is right tightening must be consistent with monetary policy stance since we"
"3080740","3086620"," don't want it to interfere and preserve market functioning so let's take a couple of things there"
"3086620","3093620"," different time frames and earning season if you're buying into an earning season let's say you're"
"3093620","3101700"," let's say you're buying tassela into its er report for its event almost always sell the news right"
"3101700","3110440"," if we trade up into an event if we trade down into an event uh normally happens right into that"
"3110440","3116600"," event and then we squeeze higher or the next day we squeeze higher week layer we squeeze that it's"
"3116600","3122760"," really great if you sell into an event because you can buy like a call spread that expires after"
"3122760","3129300"," the next expiry of that event that doesn't mean though the week before it doesn't start squeezing"
"3129300","3136260"," that or you know you have to monitor it I agree now even with that said that trade could be"
"3136260","3143340"," good right you you print you make great money on it but it's not the pay uh it's but it's"
"3143340","3149920"," still not the pay xlf is going to scream higher for the next three to six months and I think"
"3149920","3157440"," that's the point here is it's great for a trade on a short basis but on a long-term basis"
"3158100","3166320"," xlf is not expected to perform uh so let's get that clear at least historically now there's"
"3166320","3171400"," something else here that I want to talk about that I haven't didn't address on Friday and that is"
"3172040","3181660"," just on a weekly basis if you look at xlf historically let's look at it and do you see how"
"3181660","3191620"," there's no gaps left behind over here I want you to see down here sorry we've been"
"3191620","3200740"," doing a fairly good job of closing gaps over time no gaps down here"
"3200740","3209710"," no gaps"
"3209710","3219170"," no gaps at all down here now there are gaps above here but I want you to see there's two"
"3221690","3230050"," there's a gap down here at 21 change 21 284 and there's a gap down here at 25 and some"
"3230050","3242330"," change now when do we close these if the question becomes when do we close these in"
"3242330","3251910"," an efficient market thesis we're going to close these this year uh I'm not anti-us printing"
"3251910","3261370"," something fat for ER season for the banks but I am against the market moving up and xlf following"
"3261370","3268370"," or or or over what would you call it over performing with with the rest of the market in this"
"3268370","3272810"," time period so you can get that squeeze for ER and then it actually might come down and close these"
"3272810","3281010"," at some point this year so it's only I'm not bullish in xlf I'm bullish I'm bullish on it to"
"3281010","3290170"," an extent but I'm also like yeah at some point this year so let's say you buy 30 bucks am"
"3290170","3294770"," I going all all in 30 bucks probably not I'm gonna be waiting for this to get filled I'm gonna"
"3294770","3300950"," if I was gonna spend 10 grand here let's say I was originally gonna spend 100 grand here yeah you"
"3300950","3306510"," want to do 30 grand here and then maybe another 30 and then another 30 that would make sense um"
"3306510","3314330"," like not all your eggs are one basket and if it comes down here and hits 20 bucks and you're"
"3314330","3320870"," now at a DCA of you know 24 26 somewhere in here at least you're at least you're not absolutely"
"3320870","3331490"," fucked down here if this happens so just for as an efficient market thesis uh the I"
"3331490","3339650"," don't see us not I don't see us not filling these down here and you can actually see these large"
"3339650","3349390"," volume bars down here that's the weekly right one two three weeks of selling um and"

"3390780","3397380"," gaps haven't been filled yet even on a daily there's there's two gaps on the daily at 28 a 2801"
"3397380","3402900"," the 2897 even even just on let's just look at the next into the next two weeks to see these"
"3402900","3410760"," two gaps get closed wouldn't even shock me right this is a daily um gaps closed so uh uh you"

"3526060","3531360"," they're not they'll never be high flyers like they once were money-wise oh and then the third thing"
"3531360","3538640"," is of course cyclically they tend to perform horribly uh if we are a new cycle in the market uh"
"3553450","3557550"," wiki is saying I'm not bullish and excel if either but 32 35 is where it should be still trading"
"3557550","3567530"," today I agree with that if you look at excel if it once becomes down at these"

"5159120","5164400"," get the three and six month bill auctions the u.s selling 57 billion dollars of three month bills"
"5164400","5170580"," with a private's cover of two to 41 and he prior high yield of four spots six seven five percent"

"5201860","5209580"," didn't happen here and it did happen here why daily trend daily trend on on dg is extremely bearish"
"5209580","5219520"," it also had confirmation you broke down below the monthly right we had a confirmation that"
"5219520","5228060"," we were going lower not higher so we blasted down right and now you've got the daily chasing over"
"5228060","5238040"," here so trend is down on dg and not only is it down on dg but well you're going"
"5238040","5247220"," to be looking for price to confirm that trade lower somewhere at like 216 or so"
"5247220","5256060"," and even so you've got a 220 so 216 220 it can even squeeze up here again and continue with"
"5256060","5262760"," continuation lower this looks like just good old fashioned and then you've got another layer above"
"5262760","5269740"," 229 19 even if you squeezed up here you've got a lot of badness on dollar general to overcome and"
"5269740","5275200"," my point here is now i know you've got to man down below here and demand here and demand here"
"5275200","5281420"," but there comes a point one two and three there comes a point where you have just natural profit"
"5281420","5288600"," taking this is when a company has great fundamentals and yet price comes down this is a wick off"
"5288600","5295200"," kind of stuff and so i would look back to the original pump and the original pump is somewhere back"
"5295200","5304980"," here at $123 minimum somewhere back here 123 the original pump you can see the buying major support"
"5304980","5311880"," buying back here you can see there was a dip buy that was bought up and then we had the"
"5311880","5321500"," the initial run right there this is where the banks are long right here uh 120 bucks 116 uh 145ish"
"5321500","5326880"," 135 somewhere in here this is where the banks are long so this just looks like natural like take"
"5326880","5332960"," the money and run uh you can't you don't see any of the time in its history uh where the"
"5332960","5342810"," where it's broken monthly trend it's on bearish on dg it's actually a nice"

"8734820","8739240"," as price stays above this this white line you can take a bullet straight here with a stop"
"8739240","8744680"," underneath it okay typically you'll see it right here right we're staying on the white line follow"
"8744680","8751280"," the white line follow the white line break below the white line right now in SPX and there's no"
"8751280","8757520"," trade for for a for a bull until you get back above and actually retest that white line usually"

"8762200","8770900"," down sell it down sell it down on SPX now in spy specifically we're gonna go back to spy and"
"8770900","8778860"," I want you to see when the price is above fairly simple right so just intraday day if price stays"
"8778860","8784000"," above the white line you can see that we're bullish if price goes below the white line we're"
"8784000","8793900"," bearish right make sense white line underneath now bull bull planes bear planes bullow"
"8793900","8801680"," plane bearow plane doesn't matter you're looking for some kind of a hint as to what's coming so I"
"8801680","8811500"," want you to see these and that is a bull plane white line crossing above and over the red"
"8811500","8820440"," line right and a bear plane is when the white line crosses over the white line crosses over the red"
"8820440","8825900"," line here you can actually see it back here too right you can see the cross over here price gets"
"8825900","8831040"," underneath rejects confirms that it's going lower we get the bloodbath into the bell and so right"
"8831040","8837640"," now just looking at just looking at it right now price action wise you're watching a bear plane"
"8837640","8845540"," here develop right now when you see this bear plane developing bears here really want to see"
"8845540","8854080"," confirmation that we're going lower so on price at least right and price at least they're looking"
"8854080","8861120"," for BAM confirmation BAM confirmation there it is for the lower lows right there right if you"
"8861120","8867980"," wanted to take a call here not only there's two things to think about it is there's like there's"
"8867980","8872960"," like a one minute trade from here to here for bulls but then you'd have to take profits like right"
"8872960","8877180"," here you should be taking profit as a bull in a one minute chart right you should be take money"
"8877180","8881820"," off the table and then what you're doing is you're looking for a price to get above the 396 79"
"8881820","8888740"," and mostly over time a retest confirmation for a longer trade like hey we're gonna be long all day"
"8888740","8894880"," long here that kind of stuff and what you'd be looking for is a reversal right some kind of"
"8894880","8901280"," reversal so some other things that you're looking for here too which is the white and red line if"
"8901280","8908040"," this white line had been continuing down here and not flattening out it would be extremely bearish"
"8908040","8913460"," but where you see the line kind of flattening out now you're seeing velocity to the downside for"
"8913460","8919580"," the bears is slowing okay so and now you're seeing these lines kind of flatten out when you're"
"8919580","8923760"," seeing these lines flat now it becomes more bullish believe it or not this is velocity talking"
"8923760","8928400"," right on a very bearish day you would have seen this white line heading lower and price heading"
"8928400","8936660"," lower so now you're seeing a more of a bullish resolution to price at the moment make sense so up"
"8936660","8943020"," here so just as we trade up here on this five minute 396 you'd be taking profit here right and"
"8943020","8947780"," there should be a squeeze higher right but then it would come back down so you like if you if"
"8947780","8952480"," you take a trade here right let's see by this 50 cents it looks like 75 cents come back down"
"8952480","8956640"," and go to like 48 cents so you have to be like really fast on a one minute but then"
"8956640","8961120"," down here there's actually a confirmation trade for the rest of the day to become super duper"
"8961120","8970140"," bullish above make sense so one minutes five minutes and what what do they mean over time so right"
"8970140","8976260"," here nice nice fat squeeze higher right here swellers being squeezed and over run currently these"
"8976260","8980600"," are the young Jim bros down here let's look at a one minute chart kind of see his beautiful"

"10073940","10082660"," on the hourly on the hourly the one minute and the in the five minutes coming down that's usually"
"10082660","10101580"," pretty bearish on Tesla so 187 20 is where it's at right now for Tesla Winky's"
"10101580","10105720"," saying if you just step back and think about just how badly people that were big short the market"
"10105720","10110160"," were getting owned prior to the bank run that was created by one guy removing a hundred million"
"10110160","10114820"," from one bank it's kind of amazing and finally nobody's connected those two yeah I agree with that"
"10114820","10126410"," Winky yeah"
"10126410","10133250"," there's a pretty vicious pair I'll show you guys this on Tesla real quick was it pretty vicious"
"10133250","10140490"," bearish I want to show you guys something here I don't know if this plays out or not of course"
"10140490","10148130"," not a fucking crystal ball but I want you to see this on Tesla here"
"10148130","10158110"," so just on Tesla"
"10158110","10167310"," right here I want you to see this hourly right here right that's a five minute excuse me you have"
"10167310","10172270"," this on your chart already this this red in this white line okay this is a one-minute chart we're"
"10172270","10179670"," looking at here the key here though was on the hourly on the hourly back here 192 you just do"
"10179670","10188270"," a green box right here 192 okay and then I want you to do another box down below at 187"
"10188270","10194770"," 13 and you can just draw those two boxes then the one at the red and white line will help"
"10194770","10202950"," you so let me draw this out for you on a Tesla chart so this is Tesla in a one"
"10202950","10212840"," minute this is on weebel you should have this at home right 192.03 so"
"10212840","10220920"," you can just draw your own box here 192.03 right there you just draw this you make this a"
"10220920","10229460"," green box okay now this is hourly trend on Tesla right here okay and then you have daily trend on"
"10229460","10244750"," Tesla 187 17 make this"
"10244750","10250330"," one yellow right here what I want you to see though is the important part of this that I want"
"10250330","10259080"," you to see here is that this white line and this red line coming over this hourly here is forming"
"10259080","10267980"," what's called a bearish three-triggered cluster so I'm going to show you two setups for Tesla here"
"10267980","10289130"," this is just a one-minute chart here okay even if"
"10289130","10294750"," price comes back up here because you have this cluster this should be a lot of violence here for a"
"10294750","10303750"," move lower down to this 187 here okay there should be now with all that said you can't take a"
"10303750","10311910"," you can't take a call here unless price gets above this cluster so price would need to trade above"
"10311910","10323390"," here and then you would want to see both the white and red line get underneath here and even"
"10323390","10331430"," then you're looking for the retest of price hold here you want to see like that you want to see"
"10331430","10337390"," it you want to see it retest then come up and you actually just set up the calls and once"
"10337390","10344030"," that is proven you can then take that blast-off trade for Tesla does it make sense like you have"
"10344030","10350830"," development time there's work to be done in here is a bear for you to take this trade higher all"
"10350830","10355300"," this is like you know all this stuff that you see here there's no trade for you as a bull"
"10355300","10362320"," until it retests you get the cluster on your side to then to make it bullish make sense otherwise"
"10362320","10366420"," you're just guessing in here you're just like throwing shit out the window money out the window"
"10366420","10371980"," there's really no trade here for you and if you're just looking at this baseline here this is"
"10371980","10377440"," bearish price is below all of these things so there's no development in the bullish side for Tesla"
"10377440","10383820"," here there's nothing saying to you yeah we're bullish now another key here though is this if price"
"10383820","10389320"," fails to make a new low and if like you know you don't get a new low every 15 minutes"
"10389320","10394820"," to an on the hourly and the half iron stuff and you start to see these these lines flatten out"
"10394820","10400800"," here the white and red flatten out no new lows right that gives you some indication that we're"
"10400800","10405360"," gonna begin to trade higher so until you see that there's still no bullish trade here for Tesla"
"10405360","10410160"," does that make sense so if you're like eyeball on this right here like hey can I just dip your"
"10410160","10420000"," any of the any of the indicators of we're done going down still haven't been proven so what are you"
"10420000","10425220"," trying to accomplish here like I'm gonna buy 190 because it's 190 sure you can do that how long is"
"10425220","10430820"," it good for though is it good to 191 34 is it good to 192 is it good to 193"
"10430820","10436860"," just you know I'm saying so this is just another another place for a bear to tee off here and"
"10436860","10442880"," send it lower does that make sense so when you're asking like do can I buy this and I give"
"10442880","10448240"," you places earlier this morning I said to you this is your hourly this is your daily you can set"
"10448240","10454980"," this right up on any chart at home and you got your EMAs here showing you and what you're looking"
"10454980","10459920"," for to even enter a trade right so as a bull what you're looking for is the white red line"
"10459920","10464920"," to flatten out and for price to be above them and you want to see a retest of those things"
"10464920","10471540"," so you can get your fat out your your fat ass bull cluster here right your three trigger cluster to"
"10471540","10479260"," go higher right gorgeous one two and three and a retest this is a this is proof here right we've"
"10479260","10486340"," squeezed right squeezes are not bullish we come back and retest and we start taking off that's your"
"10486340","10491580"," bullish confirmation that's when you like you've got the call set up and you're gonna run this up"
"10491580","10498780"," higher right until that happens though this looks bearish to me this looks bearish we've got a new"
"10498780","10503680"," we just got a new low on Tesla so Tesla just got a new low at one eighty nine ninety"
"10503680","10511680"," four so bears don't have to do anything right now they're not required to 1249 right they got this"
"10511680","10517560"," at 1248 they got their new low so they actually have until one o'clock to get a new low"
"10517560","10523620"," like one to one fifteen they can take a new low they've got all the breathing room in the world"
"10523620","10530040"," right here bears are in charge of Tesla currently there isn't really like out you know you'd want"
"10530040","10538160"," to see it like 1215 you'd want to see a no new low right see the you have the new"
"10538160","10543300"," low but then you have a higher low right here like you'd want to see the work being done for"
"10543300","10550220"," you to even get involved in this over a period of time like five days a month something like that"
"10550220","10559980"," maybe just look at this here right just look at it right here it's a five minute chart right"
"10559980","10565480"," you've got the crossover on the one look at the bear fly or the bear playing forming up right now"
"10565480","10575210"," on on Tesla it's right here it's just begging it's just begging for a squeeze to one ninety"
"10575210","10581610"," two seventy five to take this down the one ninety two seventy seventy five maybe you have a trade"
"10581610","10587650"," to one ninety two seventy five on on on Tesla like right up in here you might have a trade"
"10587650","10597380"," right you might have this trade but it's still teled dangerous right at any moment they can send"
"10597380","10601560"," this right down on you so you're looking for you're looking for you're looking for some work in"
"10601560","10608980"," here Tesla needs some work for you to be taking trades without risk I guess in a one minute time"
"10608980","10614320"," frame yes there's a trade on Tesla but on a on a higher time frame for a longer period of"
"10614320","10634090"," time that is not at this moment spy test"
"10634090","10642210"," spy positive here spies looking better recovering a little bit good to see this right here more"
"10645820","10654820"," time spent so you see this right here if you're looking at Tesla right you see how see how spy"

"10662100","10671440"," low higher low right starting to get above now the one in five minute the red line and the white"
"10671440","10677780"," line started to turn bullish so all this work has not been done on Tesla at this point all the"
"10677780","10682220"," work that you see done spy in here has not been done on Tesla here you see what I'm saying"
"10682220","10691260"," you want to see all this constructive work for Tesla or for spy become bullish show us nice work"
"10691260","10697820"," being done you're not seeing that on spy at the Tesla at the moment are you not seeing that yet"
"10697820","10707800"," right new low new low new low these are all bearish overall on Tesla and so like catching knives on"
"10707800","10715220"," Tesla there's no need to you just wait until it shows you right the move is higher what you're"
"10715220","10723440"," waiting for higher lows consolidation time at price right we've spent a lot of time here in price"
"10723440","10731140"," on spy and you know it no moves lower right so the longer we spend here the more supportive it"
"10731140","10737440"," becomes for spy and yet we still need price on spy above the five minutes so let's look at the"
"10737440","10744980"," five minute chance by we're still not seeing that crossover right to that white and red line here"

"14710630","14716030"," probably like right here in the technology and discretionary we're not even at commercial services"
"14716030","14722970"," industrials yet we're probably right in here just the beginning of it right and we're just at the"
"14722970","14729450"," beginning likely or midway point of real estate and financials you heard me talk last week about"
"14729990","14734010"," the next big thing that's going to happen is more than likely you're going to see some kind of"
"14734010","14739130"," intervention on commercial real estate right you're more than likely going to see that at some"

"14744930","14751170"," health care construction staples so what my point here is that if we're at the beginning of"
"14751170","14771530"," technology and discretionary let's look at uh nvidia this is"
"14771530","14777810"," a daily chart of nvidia this is the initial entry this is the initial it hold on a second here"
"14777810","14787720"," this is the initial front running in october of nvidia okay this is"
"14787720","14795380"," the like the initial initiation of a front running of tech now that doesn't mean that that nvidia"
"14795380","14802800"," can't come back down or apple can't come back down for some reasonable level but it does mean for"
"14802800","14811620"," the next year call it a year maybe two that you're looking to buy dips on nvidia that doesn't mean"
"14811620","14817980"," we can't trade below here for a minute but it means that if you want your highest rate of return"
"14817980","14823240"," in this market this this upcoming market you're going to be looking towards some of these tech"
"14823240","14829740"," companies there are some bears out here though that are telling you publicly that nvidia is going"
"14829740","14835480"," to zero right it's going to blast through this this down here that kind of but that's not what's"
"14835480","14841660"," showing in the backgrounds and a more macro scale that doesn't mean you can't short nvidia to what"
"14841660","14846300"," you might consider depths of hell but what some people are saying is well we're going below a"
"14846300","14852320"," hundred nvidia and i'm telling you more than likely not uh nvidia is going to get dip spot for the"
"14852320","14860440"," next year make sense um so in your best returns here are likely over the next year to continue to"
"14860440","14869610"," buy tech and i hate saying that because there's a there's a tech browness to this uh there's a tech"
"14869610","14889040"," browness to this let me see me i'm bringing up uh nvidia here tag both"
"14889040","14898750"," look at that now"
"14898750","14906230"," my point here is twofold two they can delete some of these uh some of this some of this nvidia"
"14906230","14916030"," chart okay so my point here is that over the next year uh you could just you could"
"14916030","14926010"," literally just sit back and and try to buy nvidia at like two forty one eighty nine you"
"14926010","14930530"," could also try to buy it on let's say one bad month in june or something or july you buy"
"14930530","14936250"," it at two hundred you could just like sit back for the next year and whenever it cut whenever"
"14936250","14941970"," nvidia comes back down buy a dip in safety with a stop underneath it if we end up having one"
"14941970","14946610"," bad month where the market crashes or something bears are going crazy you'd still want to buy this"
"14946610","14952850"," because it's gonna it's gonna be it's gonna go over perform is my point because as a stock market"
"14952850","14959690"," participant this market does go up and as a stock market participant uh your best performers this"
"14959690","14968250"," year will likely be technology and discretionary spending that this is where your best performance"
"14968250","14973530"," is going to be this year now we're not talking like day do you think that you know is nvidia"
"14973530","14980470"," doomed today is then but in the key point here is this too is that you have people out there"
"14980470","14985090"," they're going to tell you that uh this is not that what the trend is going to be or this"
"14985090","14991510"," is not what the trend is going to be and i'm telling you that it's like walking and quacking like"
"14991510","14997510"," it is what the what the future is going to hold for the market so and these these are bears"
"14997510","15004870"," that are saying you know 190 180 is not the low on nvidia they're saying that it's below 100 you"
"15004870","15012710"," know not 130 they're saying that it's down here you've got actual market participants telling you"
"15013890","15021010"," that uh we're not done here but this is going to crash down here and it's going to get new"
"15021010","15026010"," lows below down here and i'm telling you that if you look at a large like if you scale out"
"15026010","15033930"," a little bit uh if that's not the case and the other part of this case here is even seeing"
"15033930","15040490"," a momentary weakness in the market this year if we do get a quote unquote crash we go right back"
"15040490","15046310"," to what price like i always want to ask that question of bears not bears but collapsed bears like"
"15046310","15051690"," so what price are you saying you know is it 20 percent from here is it 20 percent from here"
"15051690","15056410"," is it 20 percent from here is it 20 percent from here is it 20 percent from the october low"
"15056410","15061830"," like where is it from is it 30 percent from the october low remember we were all talking about 30"
"15061830","15068750"," percent from down here right which puts it what 60 10 dollars something insane right 50 bucks and"
"15068750","15074810"," you know the market is telling you otherwise so far the market is telling you no no no you know"
"15074810","15081770"," what's 30 percent of 265 right i mean you were talking about 120 bucks that's still not it means"
"15081770","15088270"," you still should have bought this even 30 percent from Nvidia's current price means you still"
"15088270","15092730"," should have bought a cobra do you see the excuses that i'm talking you got like excuse it's just"
"15092730","15098170"," excuse bill right that doesn't mean you can't get bearish here doesn't mean that you can't get but"
"15098170","15104410"," i mean i think the temperance of what your bearishness is is the key point now you can remain a"
"15104410","15109630"," bear in this market and make a ton of money but the collapse argument for the market is not showing"
"15109630","15117070"," itself as of yet um and then you know i'm a bull so you know like for me to even"
"15117070","15127050"," think what a collapse is uh seems like it's it's a ratio spread it's like and"
"15127050","15132010"," that's what you do in a bull market is you put on a ratio spread put on a ratio spread"
"15132010","15138430"," you trade the market up you buy dips wherever you can um so even though this is topi right here"
"15138430","15145450"," it looks it looks like it looks like a transition to some kind of bull market it does everything"
"15145450","15152510"," here is is good every this is a by the dip uh positioning in the market right here you can"
"15152510","15160450"," see it um that's hard to say it's hard to swallow that i don't disagree with um"
"15160450","15168330"," you know bear rage on this but you can see the buying taking place you can see it down here"
"15168330","15173950"," you can see it all in here there's accumulation going on in the market you can see some size coming"
"15173950","15183730"," in right here you can see it so uh if you're a collapse bear if you're if you're a"
"15183730","15192610"," collapse bear um if you're a collapse bear price matters"
"15192610","15202430"," you know what i mean by that like price matters like you can't you"
"15202430","15211890"," can't um you like so when we were back at three forty five three four five zero right we're back"
"15211890","15216970"," there this past summer or i believe this past october or something maybe it was summer in a matter"
"15216970","15221710"," of fact made it may 18th or so may 15th of last year we had a pretty decent low and"
"15221710","15229330"," then in october we had a really nice low well the question becomes you know we were all the the"
"15229330","15237870"," entire market was a nice little nice little bear cross here the the market becomes or the question"
"15237870","15242850"," becomes or like it's like you're sitting at a table with people and you're like okay so we're at"
"15242850","15249650"," three forty five um we're at real risk of this market going to twenty eight hundred sixteen"
"15249650","15257570"," fourteen hundred gets on the discussion table we're all just talking about that stuff but when"
"15257570","15262630"," you're when you're watching like when you watch oil get get clipped like it got clipped when you"
"15262630","15266770"," watch financials get clipped or they get clipped and when you're watching finance or when you're"
"15266770","15275410"," watching tech getting bought up in october it's it's it's leading up to it's leading up to this"
"15275410","15283160"," point of well it looks like some of this i think has to do with the Fed is the Fed"
"15283160","15290600"," is fucked up in my view the Fed is completely fucked up the timing of market mechanics and"
"15290600","15300400"," economics in society well they've kind of fucked up this entire process like the liquidity"
"15300400","15305900"," injections that we had in covid and then what people actually did with that money the cycle the"
"15305900","15312540"," normal cycles of of banking and uh in housing and commercial real and then the change of work from"
"15312540","15317160"," home and all these things all these impacts that we've never seen in the market has made like the"
"15317160","15325940"," market function uh abnormally and normal things that we would see are not happening right"
"15325940","15333540"," um so you're seeing market functions taking place that are abnormal you're seeing uh abnormalities"
"15333540","15339440"," everywhere and you're actually seeing a cycle in the stock market right now what to my point is"
"15339440","15344180"," that right now in the stock market at least you're seeing the stock you're seeing you're seeing oil"
"15344180","15349280"," crash right you're seeing uh beginnings of financials getting clipped you're seeing the beginnings"
"15349280","15356540"," of uh tech being front run even with all this work being done by the Fed you see people that"
"15356540","15360380"," bought uh like you know married the landscaper we talk about in the stream all the time until"
"15360380","15366840"," married the landscaper uh and we know that the housing market there's no crash right we know"
"15366840","15372520"," there's shortages we know people are buying houses with cash uh some of the biggest cash buyers of"
"15372520","15381180"," all time we see people that smartened up from uh 2008 2007 2000 those people are still 60 70 years"

"15395180","15402420"," lot of uh learning from people out there i think that's not talked about enough is that there are"
"15402420","15410100"," adults over the decades are learning to be better with their money that sounds insane but that's"
"15410100","15417610"," true so now we used to not see that right you go like a whole decade or two or three"
"15417610","15422630"," decades or four decades and you'd wash people out and you'd have a new class of people that didn't"

"16019740","16022920"," You're probably going to go to your husband and say, you know what, Bob?"
"16023480","16025580"," The market's probably going to crash sometime this year."
"16027140","16031900"," And at some point this year, Mary's going to look like she's right."

"16043340","16044700"," And she's going to be right."
"16046400","16055020"," Meanwhile, what she didn't know was that a market bear is going to get torched leading up to that"

"16058160","16064420"," He's going to get torched, he's going to get torched, he's going to get bent over during that time"
"16064420","16064760"," period. "
"16065620","16069260"," Another problem here is that a bull is probably going to trade that all up."
"16069700","16074640"," And when that dump comes, he's probably going to get wrecked as well."
"16075120","16077980"," So you've got like losers everywhere and some people are right. "
"16080550","16088890"," My point here is that my point in that post, though, is that the only way to really trade this"
"16088890","16096750"," market right now that we have for the next year is to hedge yourself and trade it up into the"

"16101710","16103470"," We trade in 397, 35."

"16130390","16134770"," thing to say to you is more on a high that you put on a ratio spread, put back spread. "
"16135610","16136730"," You can look it up on YouTube."

"16145510","16147450"," 397 C is now trading 89 cents. "
"16162170","16168830"," So my point here is that it's going to be, and we're in a trough right now."
"16168830","16170270"," Do you guys know what a trough is?"
"16172670","16176830"," So it's weird, like, how do I explain this in a better?"
"16178390","16185570"," I think I have explained this a bunch, but let's look at SPX daily chart here."
"16186210","16187250"," I have this already. "
"16187490","16187730"," It's good."
"16187970","16189830"," I thought I maybe I deleted this, but I haven't."
"16191530","16194150"," So, oh, I'm muting the wrong shit here. "
"16196890","16198650"," So, and this is what it is right here."
"16198890","16199290"," This is it."
"16199550","16200570"," This is what I'm explaining to you. "
"16200910","16206650"," So, you know, you'll see this craziness where we trade."
"16207670","16212250"," Trade it up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down"
"16212250","16213630"," for this year."
"16214330","16220350"," And even in this up and down, if we, when we're in this, it's considered a trough, right?"
"16221610","16225290"," And when we're in the trough, if you guys know anything about market crashes or the bottom or"
"16225290","16228330"," market bottom, we'll start creating a trough. "
"16229050","16234370"," And then we, not always, but we often will have one moment of capitulation."
"16234890","16240730"," So the one thing I would make as a note here is if you are long stock, that whenever we"
"16240730","16246770"," get that moment of capitulation, it's likely going to be just there was a two note, two notes here."
"16247030","16249430"," It's likely going to be brief. "
"16250710","16255210"," Like you're talking like it pulls back up in the month of three months, max, normally."
"16255550","16256730"," Not always, but normally."
"16258870","16262010"," Normally, but normally pulls pulls back or it comes back really fast. "
"16262970","16267710"," The only warning I would say to you here would be that's like the spy and shit like that."
"16267890","16268950"," Like spy will come back."
"16269610","16273670"," If you're long, some individual stocks, those might get reprised and never come back. "
"16274310","16279430"," So I'd be really scared of like, if you're, if you're long spy, you're probably okay."
"16280030","16288370"," If you're long, let's say some ticker that was a darling for 2020 and you see it blast down with"
"16288370","16292970"," the market, it might not, it might get reprised down here and just start fucking around down here."
"16293470","16299070"," Like the sort of safest trade here along the market is likely an index and not an individual"
"16299070","16299650"," ticker. "
"16300270","16303170"," I'm afraid of that happening with Tesla right now, believe it or not."
"16303710","16306350"," I have real fear that Tesla might get reprised."
"16307830","16310730"," And not recover with the rest of the market price-wise. "
"16311790","16313170"," So I have that fear."
"16313710","16315530"," Tesla is saying that that's the case."
"16316150","16321970"," Apple and Nvidia are not, but Tesla is, Tesla is saying when that comes, watch out, you might see a"
"16321970","16322710"," repricing event. "
"16324190","16326550"," And that's because they haven't delivered on a bunch of shit."
"16326810","16329670"," I'm a Tesla bull, but they have not delivered on a bunch of shit."
"16330490","16331610"," That's been priced into it. "
"16332010","16333210"," That's my take on Tesla."
"16333210","16339910"," But if you're long like spy or something, you own the spy S&P 500, it'll likely be brief and"
"16339910","16340690"," come right back up."
"16340850","16342570"," When we usually have that capitulation moment. "
"16342710","16343730"," So how do you trade this market?"
"16343870","16344410"," I don't fucking know."
"16344870","16351410"," I think you trade it up and you hedge the market whenever you can, like with a ratio spread for"
"16351410","16352670"," this event to take place."
"16353710","16354770"," It's still showing itself. "
"16355110","16358170"," There is that risk that we go down, but actively hedging."
"16358830","16364850"," The market is different than, different than actively trying to trade it as a collapse."
"16367030","16371470"," Trade it as a, you know, like we were doing back here, like this. "
"16372530","16374030"," We aren't doing this right now."
"16374090","16374610"," Do you see that?"
"16375070","16376570"," We're not doing this right now."
"16376670","16377990"," We're not doing this right now. "
"16378130","16379370"," We're not doing this right now."
"16379410","16380050"," We just aren't."
"16380310","16382390"," We're not doing this action right now. "
"16382450","16383349"," This action ended."
"16385349","16388169"," So we're not, we're not doing, see the difference, sell the rip."
"16388450","16390230"," And this looks like by the dip, doesn't it?"
"16391509","16394669"," This looks like by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip. "
"16394810","16397810"," If you get a low, by the dip, you see what I'm saying?"
"16398110","16404090"," There's a stark difference in what the market looks like and it has looked like for some period of"
"16404090","16404330"," time."
"16406090","16408590"," This looks like by the dip, doesn't look like sell the rip."
"16409730","16410189"," So far. "
"16414540","16420860"," Since May, believe it or not, or the transition started in May and then it really completed in"
"16420860","16421119"," October."
"16421119","16425860"," So if you had some like overlap and sell the rip and buy the dip, it was between May and"
"16425860","16426640"," October, it happened."
"16429259","16431040"," And now we're in this, whatever. "
"16431360","16437060"," If we have capitulation moment, ever, this year, if we have like a bloodbath, I'm fucking buying"
"16437060","16437300"," it."

"16476990","16480710"," I'd be taking the week off and I would just be paying attention."
"16480710","16482849"," So I'd be trying to put some size in the market. "

"16517849","16520169"," I'm going to pay attention to what JPM puts out."
"16520630","16525029"," I'm going to watch Fintuit because there's a lot of smart people in Fintuit that will be like, hey"

"16540330","16541830"," Then I would be making a decision."

"16546290","16550770"," Am I going to wait two or three weeks or a month to grab a dip to buy for this"
"16550770","16551330"," next quarter?"
"16552009","16553430"," I'm going to sell this quarter."

"16912410","16915130"," A lot of this is probable's, right?"
"16915550","16920470"," How probable is it that you have like if somebody was if you were to look up a chart of"
"16920470","16923190"," April's performance year over year."
"16923370","16925290"," Like how every April, how do we do?"
"16925890","16929250"," And you start to see how many profitable apples we have. "
"16929290","16933410"," How many how many negative we have and then how many do we have twice in a row?"
"16934950","16940170"," It's rare that you have like two, three, four, five bad April's."
"16940790","16947170"," There is an aspect to this to where institutions get tired."
"16947810","16950770"," Like I want you to know that like tired like we're selling this market. "
"16950770","16954930"," We're selling this market and you have your people that work for you selling this market."
"16955510","16956990"," And then you take a break from it."
"16957230","16958390"," We're going to ease off for a minute. "
"16959070","16960450"," We have nobody left to sell into."
"16961090","16965630"," So you could see a time period where we don't sell this market."
"16966150","16968450"," You take a vacation, take a summer off. "
"16969510","16971170"," You guys know what those are like, right?"
"16971990","16972690"," And not bull."
"16972890","16974210"," Let's say we're not in a real bull market."
"16974270","16976170"," They kind of some kind of fucked up bull market. "
"16978030","16981970"," Like some kind of like mutated bull market for this year."
"16982470","16986930"," But if you've been in a bull market like a summer, everyone's taking vacation."
"16987390","16988710"," You'll see the market trade sideways. "
"16989290","16990650"," You'll be not, not with me in stream."
"16990830","16995250"," I'll have to put up like a, like a, like a, like a swing or a swing."
"16995490","16996590"," But like what are those things called?"
"16999370","17000670"," They're, I don't know what they're called. "
"17000910","17003390"," Like fucking old sailors used to use them."
"17004170","17005150"," Like a hammock."
"17005750","17009230"," And you'll be nodding off in the middle of the daytime shred day trade in the spy. "
"17009750","17010810"," Because it's so slow."
"17011130","17012410"," Like the dog days of summer."
"17013730","17016070"," People nodding off in the middle of like thin to it. "
"17016070","17019410"," You'll see guys like they'll be like, they'll be like posting on thin to it."
"17019710","17021910"," And then they disappear and then they come back and they go."
"17022610","17023350"," I'm sorry. "
"17023490","17024630"," I nodded out and took a nap."
"17026890","17031970"," Now trade in our one 397 93 blasting through right now."
"17033630","17037130"," Two 38 in the afternoon squeezing higher to three 9801. "
"17038850","17042510"," Big green balls on right there."
"17042970","17044010"," Big green balls."
"17046010","17047330"," Sellers being squeezed. "
"17049590","17052570"," 397 sees trading a dollar 22, but I'm not in them."
"17052890","17054210"," I'm flat right now."
"17054870","17056090"," I took my money and ran. "
"17064860","17070880"," You know, say any kind of strength you're going to see selling into this week."
"17071000","17071920"," You should see it."
"17072140","17074960"," Anytime I get up to like 406 around there, you should see it. "
"17075420","17078980"," There is potential with that collar, though, that we trade for 10, believe it or"
"17078980","17092860"," not."
"17099350","17111250"," Winky's given an update to John"
"17111250","17111590"," Haggard."
"17111690","17112470"," He's looking to short this. "
"17116780","17117640"," Let's look at it."
"17117740","17119380"," It's two 39 in the afternoon."
"17120300","17121920"," Let's take a look at the market for the week. "
"17122880","17124280"," Spend some time up here."
"17124620","17127020"," You can see some supply coming in right now."
"17128120","17128700"," Into the market. "
"17128900","17130680"," Let's look at the rest of the week here, though."
"17131260","17132960"," Let's take a look at what we're expecting this week."
"17137320","17137600"," Okay. "
"17138960","17140820"," So just some insight here."
"17143690","17145070"," What do we see above?"
"17147390","17147450"," Right."
"17147590","17149110"," For just this week, end of quarter. "
"17149430","17152950"," We've got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday right here, right?"
"17173460","17181560"," Now, under normal circumstances, like normal circumstances on a higher time frame, maybe telling"
"17181560","17182840"," you, yeah, we'll go into the moon."
"17182840","17185240"," We're going to, we're going to go print for 2430."
"17185680","17186700"," This being end of quarter. "
"17188260","17190560"," And then expect something like just like this, right?"
"17190940","17192180"," Sell into some strength here."
"17192720","17193880"," Buy some dips down here."
"17194820","17195080"," Right?"
"17195280","17195800"," That kind of stuff. "
"17196200","17197020"," Something like that."
"17197220","17197560"," You see that?"
"17197840","17198900"," Just like selling in the strength."
"17199560","17200460"," Taking some profit. "
"17200860","17201360"," NVIDIA profit."
"17201960","17202300"," Tesla profit."
"17202660","17204720"," Whatever it is you want to, or Apple profit or whatever. "
"17206540","17207660"," Something like that, right?"
"17208120","17210340"," And I'm going to expect something weird like this, right?"
"17211120","17214700"," It's going to corkscrew right into the end of quarter here."
"17214740","17215660"," They're going to park this shit."
"17215880","17216100"," That's right. "
"17216200","17216860"," That's what I think."
"17217420","17218700"," Now I can be proven wrong."
"17218900","17220460"," That's $78 and 12 cents. "
"17220580","17221240"," I can be wrong here."
"17221500","17227760"," $3.13. So 4.17%. No, we don't corkscrew."
"17227900","17228660"," We've had some quarters. "
"17228900","17232420"," We blast like last minute, a finagle or whatever."
"17233440","17234480"," But for right now."
"17236160","17236940"," In a Friday. "
"17239860","17240620"," And a quarter."
"17241780","17242580"," Something like that."
"17246070","17247470"," It's got a 15 minute chart. "
"17256380","17257160"," Down here."
"17259600","17260480"," True range."
"17265890","17266830"," Right up there. "
"17267010","17268150"," Some true range right up there."
"17268790","17270250"," And then some true range right down here."
"17303320","17304640"," By the dip. "
"17304920","17305300"," By the dip."
"17305700","17306420"," By the dip."
"17307800","17308900"," Squeeze up here. "
"17308900","17309940"," 406."
"17311440","17313020"," Squeeze to 410 up there."
"17313700","17314400"," Big old squeeze. "
"17315120","17315540"," Take profit."
"17316220","17316680"," Window dressing."
"17317660","17318740"," Come back down in a Friday. "
"17319940","17320480"," 394400."
"17320680","17321080"," Somewhere in here."
"17324280","17327540"," Something like that. "
"17334570","17335390"," About the dip."
"17335630","17335990"," About the dip."
"17336210","17336570"," About the dip. "
"17337370","17337710"," About the dip."
"17338790","17341110"," Selling into some strength back over here."
"17343250","17345050"," Probably going to sell this right here. "
"17348230","17350150"," And then here's where the bombs come in right."
"17350310","17351590"," This is where the hedging comes in."
"17351870","17352950"," Bam slams it down. "
"17353210","17354290"," Bam slams it down."
"17354590","17355550"," Bam slams it down."
"17356190","17358070"," It's like just just some rolling over. "
"17358630","17359150"," Right."
"17359510","17360170"," Comes back up."
"17360330","17360930"," Comes back up. "
"17361150","17361750"," Comes back up."
"17362650","17364910"," Setting up for a week of not."
"17365150","17367810"," It's volatility, but it's volatility based around positioning. "
"17372840","17373360"," Yeah."
"17373520","17374020"," Just up in here."
"17375180","17375660"," Sellers here. "
"17375860","17376460"," Sellers here."
"17376780","17377280"," Sellers here."
"17392230","17393590"," Dip buyers in here. "
"17408730","17410890"," Bears trying to get a roll in here, right?"
"17417000","17418040"," Bulls are like."
"17419920","17422160"," Bulls are like, we got to wait and see what happens."
"17426500","17428380"," Get that 420 out of the way. "
"17430280","17432520"," Meanwhile, lots of volatility above, right?"
"17433340","17434520"," If you're a bull, what's going on here?"
"17434520","17435240"," What are you looking for?"
"17435840","17437640"," You're not looking to mess around with this."
"17438080","17439520"," You're looking for that retest."
"17440040","17441240"," Take that long, right?"
"17441440","17444000"," So is there a trade for bull setting into the weekend?"
"17444320","17445100"," Probably fucking not. "
"17445960","17449860"," Even if you get through this nonsense up here, you still want to be proven right."
"17451840","17453640"," This is the money trade right here."
"17455180","17457380"," Otherwise, it's just sell the rip down below. "
"17458700","17459940"," Finding where the positioning is."
"17460120","17463080"," Might even be somewhere for us to go up."
"17463080","17466080"," We get the roll, then the bounce up higher, right?"
"17467040","17474020"," So it's tough, like, intraday stuff you can do, but heading into this shit show that we have. "
"17476720","17477520"," Tagged R1."
"17480360","17483140"," We know support right now is sitting down here, right?"
"17483260","17485340"," We know the triggers are down below, so this is supportive."
"17490230","17494490"," I don't know why that's not coming up on my charts, but I want you to see that. "
"17495850","17496930"," It's a five minute chart."
"17500090","17502150"," Right, you know that all this is going to be volatile."
"17502190","17503950"," You know this is all volatility above. "
"17505210","17510850"," And you know that if you're a bull that you don't want to be trapped in here, you want to"
"17510850","17520510"," see the breaking of this, the successful retest of it, and that we're going higher over here."
"17521170","17522370"," This is all volatility."
"17523210","17526470"," And this is going to be used by participants to hedge the market. "
"17527290","17531390"," If you're looking for a place to hedge, then this is a pretty good place, right?"
"17531590","17538250"," If you're up here, if you can get some kind of a putback spread, and if we do go higher,"
"17538650","17541530"," you're going to print the putback spread for free."
"17555230","17556990"," And that's where your R2 is."
"17557550","17560750"," R3, natural selling places in the market. "
"17583310","17585250"," That's like above and see where supply is."
"17598620","17600060"," Oh, there it is right there."
"17600220","17601240"," Well, there it is. "
"17604330","17605170"," That's that 410."
"17605610","17607330"," I want you to be aware of that up here, okay?"
"17608430","17611470"," So you see, you see this right here?"
"17614050","17616290"," That's my concern is that one right there."
"17616770","17619350"," Like this one is hiding in the background. "
"17620890","17625470"," If you wanted a bull squeeze case at some point this week, it's right there."
"17626290","17627270"," You can see it."
"17627730","17629050"," It's just sitting up there waiting. "
"17630610","17632590"," If you're a bear, this concerns me."
"17639990","17640790"," It's up there."
"17640930","17641650"," It's hiding up there. "
"17645800","17653580"," If you're like a bear, if you're a bear, if you're a patient bear, there"
"17653580","17659100"," is a chance we go up there."
"17660600","17663700"," My my that that 410 that's up there."
"17664540","17670200"," Man, I'm like, I keep looking at that one and I'm like, like what they could do is fucking wait"
"17670200","17670820"," until Friday. "
"17671320","17676060"," They just rip that shit right up into 410 on on ES and on SPX."
"17678120","17679880"," And that's where you should have taken a short."
"17680480","17683180"," And they'll guarantee we go there, but I don't like that it's sitting up there. "
"17686480","17688340"," That's like a greedy patient bear."
"17695130","17696210"," It's up there though."
"17697090","17697910"," I know it's there. "
"17698030","17698430"," I see it."
"17703620","17708480"," If you want the best position, like teeing off from the top, 410."
"17709940","17711020"," 410 on ES. "
"17717010","17718710"," A very liquid bear."
"17721890","17724330"," You want the exact price you'd have to."
"17724330","17725770"," I haven't done the math this weekend. "
"17726090","17726850"," I usually do the math."
"17727090","17730750"," The difference between spy and spy and ES."
"17730750","17731610"," You just you can easily. "
"17731850","17737470"," You just take 410 or you see what the price of a or where we are right now currently and"
"17737470","17739630"," just minus that from spy and you can get the ratio."
"17740390","17743450"," Usually between one and three dollars somewhere in there."
"17748320","17752440"," Breaking through our one right now, trying to return to the scene of the crime on the open this"
"17752440","17752720"," morning. "
"17753500","17754380"," 398 58."
"17762910","17766730"," Yeah, Jimmy Barry's saying I've got 410, 415, 420, 430."
"17766890","17768850"," Then if they really want to be pricks for 60, then crash. "
"17769510","17771350"," Yeah, very on the upside."
"17771590","17772510"," I see the same thing, man."
"17772910","17774010"," We already tagged 420. "
"17774450","17776290"," So it's 434 60 up next, right?"
"17776890","17777730"," Or do we leave that one?"
"17778450","17779430"," We left that one."
"17781310","17781990"," Gap behind that."
"17782170","17784670"," We went up there close the gap and left the gap right on the upside. "
"17786010","17787370"," And 460 is on the table too."
"17788350","17789210"," I've measured that move."
"17789790","17790970"," We've been talking about that move for what?"
"17790970","17792370"," How long we were talking about that, Jimmy?"
"17793090","17795050"," Pass fucking two months or three months, right?"
"17795710","17796310"," That was the. "
"17798030","17801850"," That was the cup and handle that turns into the inverse head and shoulders, right?"
"17802110","17807250"," As it gets validated, you get 460 measured on the inverse head and shoulders, I think."
"17808570","17812890"," I think this quarter end matters for that to play out."
"17813070","17813190"," So. "
"17821280","17821720"," Fuck."
"17821880","17822360"," Yeah, you can."
"17825020","17825900"," Whatever you want. "
"17829800","17830460"," Whatever you like."
"17831240","17832420"," Whatever you want, brother."
"17844570","17846150"," Yeah, I don't have bias either. "
"17849190","17852570"," I want to see like positioning, even for that kind of a move."
"17852670","17853450"," I want to see positioning."
"17868120","17869700"," Let's go back and look at. "
"17870880","17872040"," What was it, pins?"
"17875040","17877200"," DG is still selling down, right?"
"17878680","17879580"," Or no, it doesn't."
"17879980","17881100"," DG's just holding itself."
"17881800","17882820"," DG's still looking good. "
"17883840","17885320"," I still don't like it over time."
"17890620","17891940"," Let's look at DG real quick."
"17892080","17893960"," Let's go back and look at DG and see if it can. "
"17896220","17897800"," As I said, I was bearish on it."
"17898500","17899580"," Yeah, I'm bearish from."
"17900580","17901940"," I'm still bearish on DG. "
"17903720","17904660"," I'm bearish at."
"17905500","17907740"," Resell, GG at 215 26."
"17908640","17911460"," And 220 27 and then 229. "
"17914160","17915760"," Though it is bullish right here."
"17916780","17918640"," Like for the moment, DG is bullish."
"17919500","17925480"," If you're if you were asking about DG earlier, if you can see, if DG can stay above 206 33. "
"17926180","17927280"," 206 33."
"17927820","17933640"," If you can stay above, there is a trade to 215 36 somewhere in there."
"17934660","17938320"," So like intraday, bullish, DG, overall bearish. "
"17939560","17940960"," Pins we looked at earlier."
"17942040","17942700"," I like pins."
"17947100","17948320"," We should look at pins. "
"17951530","17953890"," Let's see how pins really quick because someone asked about it."
"17955190","17956870"," And I promised that I would do it."
"17964170","17964610"," Pins. "
"17967210","17969090"," I like the stock to an extent."
"17972710","17975070"," It looks like it's done, right?"
"17975750","17976850"," It's beautiful here, right?"
"17978530","17981410"," I like I like that it's consolidated sideways."
"17982490","17984490"," There's a ton of work to do in pins. "
"17985170","17987830"," I like the stock."
"17991110","17999230"," You should see, though, a rejection on $30.68. But even with that said, if you're if you're able to"
"17999230","18001930"," get above, just call it 30 bucks."
"18002030","18008630"," If you're able to get above 30 bucks and you do some more consolidating, I think pins has a lot"
"18008630","18010190"," a lot of room to move higher here. "
"18011930","18013030"," I do like it."
"18016500","18018180"," On a smaller time frame."
"18020200","18021040"," It's right here. "
"18021220","18028710"," So if you want if you're trading pins, as long as it stays above, it's hourly price started above"
"18028710","18029370"," 30 bucks."
"18030750","18034110"," With that said, though, it's going to need it's daily, it's weekly, it's hourly."
"18034790","18037270"," It's got it's got a lot of squeeze potential here. "
"18038510","18042310"," But I'd really like to see it like really see it like like see all these things come up here,"
"18042410","18043330"," come up here, come up here."
"18044330","18052890"," Consolidation smash breakthrough and then come back down to earth at 30 bucks for some real moves"
"18052890","18053330"," higher."
"18054690","18058270"," 30 bucks price action at 30 is going to be critical. "
"18060610","18061650"," I like it though."
"18062830","18064510"," I like buying lows on it."
"18064510","18070930"," I like just buying these lows very simple pins, easy, easy to trigger to trade. "
"18071090","18072770"," This reminds me of SE back in the day."
"18073390","18077070"," Nice easy trading on this Pinterest doing really good."
"18078890","18087250"," If you're not long pins, if you get this rejection here, you'll be looking to grab it again down at"
"18087250","18088870"," like 25, 24 dollars. "
"18089650","18094510"," And again, and again until you smash above this 30 bucks."
"18095490","18097190"," And this might have to come down to help you too."
"18097390","18104710"," Like if you get rejection here, you can actually get some help with the monthly and get a squeeze"
"18104710","18106270"," even lower at 25 bucks. "
"18106650","18112050"," So if you don't get it right now, over time you could get it coming into April, like pins."
"18114050","18120410"," You see the difference here in pins versus, see the difference here in pins versus, let's do pins."
"18121510","18122910"," Just look at the setup on pins. "
"18127230","18128330"," That's a nice setup."
"18129450","18132730"," Right consolidation, trying to break higher."
"18133130","18134250"," I like this pin setup. "
"18135090","18139230"," And then when I look at DG, what does that look like?"
"18140630","18143350"," This looks like the start right of the rollover doesn't it?"
"18143990","18152690"," So not that there isn't like a trade higher on DG, but you get the squeeze higher here, but that's"
"18152690","18153610"," the move right there."
"18154610","18155930"," That's the move right there."
"18156330","18157830"," This is where the money is right there. "
"18158810","18160030"," This is where the money is."
"18160350","18167030"," Whereas the flip opposite pins Pinterest is looking like the move is higher on pins, right?"
"18198760","18204260"," Yeah, it looks like pins is making a market and it looks like DG is trying to sell to make"
"18204260","18204840"," a new market."
"18207900","18210220"," See if it gets a capitulation to this bell. "
"18210720","18213380"," Keep your eyes on any of the news out there."
"18214180","18216680"," Make sure that they're not going to try to sell us down here."
"18223770","18228930"," All morning they've been harping on Fed swaps once again to show hike more likely than not from"
"18228930","18229170"," May. "
"18230890","18232310"," Nice squeeze higher now."
"18232350","18235790"," Trade three ninety eight twelve trying to close the gap above here."

"18303240","18305920"," everybody thinking that it's going to go up because they're coming into a recession."
"18307340","18308200"," That's what I would do."
"18308600","18311580"," I was back at front run the shit out of it and then I would sell into you. "

"18660140","18661600"," So you can hear it I'll put it on. "
"18664330","18665790"," You can't have it both ways."
"18665970","18667390"," You can't have your cake and eat it too."
"18668010","18671510"," So we're hearing a lot about the financial system sound and all that. "
"18672010","18677170"," But you know in the United States we've had such a different movement."
"18677750","18679850"," In the bank sector over the past."
"18680070","18683010"," I'm talking back 20 years really or at least at least 2005. "
"18684390","18687510"," Where the US banks if you look at Bank of America."
"18687510","18690830"," It went all the way back to a tie or nearly to a tie back in."
"18691270","18694310"," 2005, 2006 JP Morgan way above. "
"18694850","18697210"," The highs pre financial global financial crisis."
"18697730","18699250"," Wells Fargo same thing."
"18699650","18701910"," But you look at Credit Suisse and they never recover. "
"18702830","18706690"," From the global financial crisis they were still down like 90%."
"18706690","18709130"," This is that re pricing I was talking about earlier."
"18709410","18712690"," And that's the same chart pattern that we see on Deutsche Bank. "
"18712910","18715710"," And it's the same chart pattern that we see on the society."
"18716490","18718450"," They're all down from their highs."
"18718730","18720190"," So I want to talk to you about this real quick. "
"18720330","18723030"," What he's saying here is you don't see them recover in price."
"18723030","18727030"," S.G. 85% and now they're raising interest rates."
"18727330","18730190"," So it seems to be that there's obvious financial. "
"18730930","18736550"," For agility in Europe and the United States is also trying to cause a recession."
"18736930","18743890"," And we've seen what's happened to the financial system with the fact that the Fed really was too"
"18743890","18744310"," slow."
"18744310","18747750"," We talked about this a year ago, you remember pain to get off the ladder judge. "
"18748450","18751170"," And the Fed should have raised rates much faster instead."
"18752270","18754990"," Inflation came and it's not really the Fed raising rates."
"18755230","18759470"," So if you get this, if you get a re pricing on certain pick like individual pickers, you're"
"18759470","18760230"," probably safer. "
"18760230","18766890"," My point in that post on Twitter was probably safer buying the S&P 500 like an actual, actually"
"18766890","18769490"," buying it, then hedging it with a."
"18770410","18771930"," Because the Fed wasn't fighting it."
"18771930","18774210"," With a ratio spread."
"18774710","18781030"," Rather than individual pickers that are at risk of being reprised in that move lower. "
"18781390","18784490"," I remember it was I think it was called Cobra Lang."
"18784710","18786610"," I think one of the last interviews I said was Apollo Cribs."
"18786750","18789190"," Cobra Lang, the rocky series who predicted pain. "
"18789470","18792130"," And that's what Jay Powell did last fall."
"18792530","18795410"," And he's continued to deliver on that prediction."
"18796230","18800430"," So the market is now suggesting you've got a 50% chance of a may hike. "
"18800430","18808270"," Now, you're saying it seems to me that if they go, if they go again, we risk more problems within"
"18808270","18811950"," the system, be it the banks, some worry about commercial real estate."
"18812690","18815890"," But overall that they are going to continue to."
"18816510","18820090"," Support your issues within the economy if they continue on this path. "
"18820430","18822390"," Like they suggest they they are."
"18822910","18829450"," If they continue on this path, the gap between what you can get on T bills and what you can"
"18829450","18831190"," get in the banking system will."
"18831490","18833130"," I'm going to interject here for a moment. "
"18833450","18834610"," I want you to know that."
"18835830","18836750"," Into this."
"18839610","18841190"," Into this close here. "
"18841430","18846190"," There are 386,000 calls at 398 C."
"18848930","18851470"," They likely won't allow these to print."
"18851470","18855210"," Not always, but sometimes they do try to be aware that as we come into this close."
"18857370","18860510"," There's 400,000 calls here at 398. "
"18860810","18862690"," So they would be in the money."
"18864330","18868110"," So if we trade up here and close up here."
"18869330","18870890"," Someone's going to own a bunch of the spy. "
"18877210","18880470"," I don't think anyone's going to want to own this maybe."
"18880970","18884210"," I know that there's a lot of traders that are like, I don't mind owning it."
"18885210","18890830"," Just a heads up that we've got 398 C, 387,000 contracts. "
"18891130","18894670"," Treasuries is a hedge to credit and I continue to advocate that as a strategy."
"18895210","18900430"," And I would continue to move in that direction if we get more towards 390 or so on the tenure"
"18900430","18905390"," from the level that we are today, which is about three, three and a half."
"18907030","18911670"," So I mean, when some say, look, you know, inflation is obviously still bad. "
"18911670","18918570"," And I know you point to, you know, a direct cause and result of, you know, the Fed starting too"
"18918570","18924190"," late and then going too fast, which is why SPB in your estimation had the bulk of its issues."
"18924370","18928750"," I mean, there are those who would say it was more mismanagement than anything else."
"18929350","18930730"," Not hedging out risk. "
"18930970","18935970"," I think there were a victim of their own success."
"18936370","18941890"," They had the bad luck of having a deluge of deposits coming in and because of the distortions in"
"18941890","18944870"," the economy in 2021 when there was no interest rates."
"18945690","18946570"," And so what are you going to do?"
"18946950","18950350"," I mean, if you're looking for a dip to buy on the supply, I'm going to give you three targets"
"18950350","18950810"," to buy. "
"18951230","18954690"," It was zero on short term security."
"18955130","18963730"," So 396, 33, 395, 90, you can't buy treasuries and hedge out their interest rate risk and earn"
"18963730","18965010"," greater than the T bill deal."
"18965010","18969670"," Or if price can get above 39774. "
"18969950","18971590"," You have to mark those to market."
"18972070","18975030"," And so you have a mismatch from the accounting perspective."
"18975770","18980330"," But if they hadn't gotten all those deposits in, you know, they, they, they, or if they got them in"
"18980330","18985210"," now, like might be happening to some of the money center banks, it's a pretty easy way to earn"
"18985210","18985430"," carry. "
"18985710","18990330"," If you're a bank paying out 25 basis points and your securities, you can buy T bills."
"18991090","18991930"," You'll end four and a half."
"18991930","18992990"," I mean, they're matched. "
"18992990","18994470"," It's sort of a money machine."
"18994950","18997210"," So that's, that's pretty good for the money center banks."
"18997430","19001390"," Obviously there's, this is an uneven stress on the system at the present time. "
"19002350","19005950"," I mean, I know we're sitting here talking about the possibility of more hikes."
"19006290","19008530"," You in fact think that we're going to see cuts."
"19009230","19013210"," You tweeted if that will be cutting quote substantially soon. "
"19014170","19018090"," What does substantially mean in your mind and how many times will they cut this year, do you think?"
"19019350","19024390"," A couple of times, I think, and it's, I think when I wrote that tweet, we were going to read"
"19024390","19027170"," the tea, which bank is going to go down next."
"19028050","19033430"," And that was consistent with the two year treasury dropping 150 basis points from Thai yield."
"19034190","19036670"," And it's relaxed somewhat, but it's still down a lot. "
"19036790","19038070"," I'm on a one minute time right now."
"19038170","19040090"," And now it's at 4%."
"19040090","19041450"," So it's still a big drop. "
"19041450","19048430"," So I think that the Fed is not going to raise interest rates unless for some reason, the two year"
"19048430","19049950"," treasury rates starts to go back up."
"19050090","19055250"," But I just don't see it because the world has woken up to this gap again."
"19055410","19056390"," I think this is really critical. "
"19056730","19060630"," And people are talking about it, but it's probably even more important as generally believed."
"19060870","19061730"," The blind skin lack."
"19061930","19064450"," It's just because we're not raised rates until two years. "
"19065210","19067010"," For two years, 4%."
"19067010","19072230"," And what you're getting at a money center bank or a G-SIV is just enormous."
"19072850","19075050"," And it's going to keep downward pressure, I think, on the two year. "
"19075650","19080750"," And also that is going to keep the pressure on the Fed not to be raising short-term interest rates"
"19080750","19080990"," further."
"19081630","19083610"," Also, the economy is just clearly weak."
"19083710","19088610"," And I think everybody knows that even the Wall Street economists that are kind of trained to be"
"19088610","19090630"," looking for green shoots and everything. "
"19091390","19093730"," Almost everybody realizes there's a recession coming."
"19093730","19096210"," It's just a question of how severe it's going to be."
"19096590","19099170"," And as a bond manager, it doesn't make any difference. "
"19100190","19105430"," Because, frankly, whether it's raining half an inch an hour, you need an umbrella if it's raining"
"19105430","19106370"," half an inch an hour."
"19106570","19108910"," So if it's not that bad of a recession, you still need an umbrella."
"19109330","19111910"," And if it's raining two inches an hour, well, you still need an umbrella. "
"19112350","19113470"," We bought PLT."
"19113510","19114170"," We wanted to squeeze."
"19117450","19119730"," We demand that it squeezes once this year. "
"19120410","19124210"," When we get back up in long rates, which I expect should happen."
"19124390","19125810"," We're buying the fuck out of PLT."
"19126430","19128490"," We wanted to squeeze at least once this summer, please. "
"19128710","19133790"," As we've seen through this period of turmoil, they do act as a ballast against credit markets,"
"19134190","19135330"," which have been wobbling a bit."
"19135830","19140230"," And Scott, I'd like to talk about the message from the credit markets because it's a little bit"
"19140230","19144130"," wonky, but most people, because it's wonky, don't have visibility into it."
"19144130","19146590"," But the high of bond market is shut down. "
"19146910","19149370"," There hasn't been a high of bond since March 2nd."
"19149790","19153570"," And what's happening in the high of bond market is we call spread decompression."
"19154010","19158230"," In other words, the spreads on the junkier stuff, the triple C is being the lowest rated. "
"19158970","19163750"," The spread on those has widened pretty substantially versus double B's, which is the highest"
"19163750","19166230"," quality in the jump on a universe."
"19166230","19175310"," And that's showing signs of continued instability, or at least should be watched as that spread is"
"19175310","19175590"," a real..."
"19175590","19178230"," You want to get a fat print on high quality bonds, baby?"
"19178390","19180290"," It's not looking really good."
"19180970","19183170"," So that's something that we're really, really wanting. "
"19183170","19186490"," He's like, make sure you've been buying the dips on PLT since the start of the year."
"19187430","19187970"," We're going to get a print."
"19187970","19189810"," Such as types of securities. "
"19190330","19192150"," The default rate is going to go off."
"19192490","19193130"," We've seen the bank."
"19193450","19196770"," Leonard Stanford is very substantially done it again. "
"19197190","19203710"," That leads to fall rates in the lower tiers of credit, particularly jump on market months to a"
"19203710","19203930"," year."
"19204510","19207850"," And we're right at that point and the conditions are getting tough."
"19208410","19213130"," So I think you want to be in the middle tiers of credit hedging it with long-term treasuries. "
"19213130","19216970"," And the market has been very generous to be able to put those trades on."
"19217430","19219370"," The markets have been very range-bound."
"19219630","19221670"," You showed that chart of the S&P 500. "
"19222350","19223750"," It's been with 4,000."
"19224070","19225890"," It's been in a range for a long time."
"19226030","19226430"," I mean..."
"19227130","19228450"," Say it, dude, gun lock. "
"19228650","19230030"," Because everything I'm Italian, I'm gun locked."
"19230170","19231250"," They're not listening to me, man."
"19231410","19234270"," They're not listening to me. "
"19234410","19236070"," They're not listening to me."
"19236070","19236450"," I think..."
"19236450","19237130"," Tell them."
"19238510","19242330"," One of them is up very slightly and one of them is almost exactly at zero. "
"19242570","19244210"," No gains in two years."
"19244670","19249310"," Of course, that's been better than bonds as we talked about in past discussions."
"19249950","19251510"," But we're really in a trading range. "
"19251610","19253310"," Yields are in a trading range too right now."
"19253470","19257930"," If you look at the 30-year treasury of its coiling, it's been going into a narrower and narrower"
"19257930","19258330"," range."
"19258750","19260410"," I think it's going to break out to the inside. "
"19261830","19269330"," Do you think that as a result of the banking crisis that we just exhibited, that if we have a"
"19269330","19273930"," recession, it's going to be worse than you would have otherwise thought before?"
"19274290","19277890"," I ask you that question in the context of what Ian Shepertson of Pantheon..."
"19277890","19280570"," My fear here is that it's extended."
"19281430","19282410"," It's not recession."
"19282990","19284610"," It's like this really bizarre like..."
"19285270","19290430"," It's going to take like five years to get married to have broken down lawn equipment and have"
"19290430","19291310"," broken down trucks. "
"19292570","19296830"," People that age out of their homes, it's like this mutated weirdness."
"19297170","19298610"," It's not really like a recession."
"19299210","19305530"," I think that if we have a recession against this financial system, I think it's a really mutated"
"19305530","19306330"," thing. "
"19306550","19307650"," Very dramatically."
"19308130","19312790"," And we've seen in the past few recessions that it's always more deficit spending."
"19313010","19314950"," People got zero percent rates on mortgages. "
"19315530","19316770"," They have brand new trucks."
"19317130","19318010"," They have brand new houses."
"19318670","19319670"," They got jobs. "
"19320770","19322630"," They're saying they're going to support jobs."
"19323310","19326770"," This all points to sideways for like fucking five years."
"19326950","19328250"," And we've seen the effect of that. "
"19328750","19330510"," That we've seen to across the Rubicon."
"19331030","19336210"," We've done this long enough that it's going to be difficult to keep going."
"19336350","19341810"," And also the other thing that's looming and this is really important is that the entitlement"
"19341810","19344110"," programs need to be reformed. "
"19344450","19346550"," And it's not our grandchildren's problem anymore."
"19346550","19352790"," The Social Security Trustees themselves admit that they're out of money in nine years, assuming no"
"19352790","19353350"," recession."
"19353670","19354270"," Now that is it. "
"19354850","19356210"," This is a key point."
"19356550","19358630"," We have to cut benefits by 20%."
"19358630","19359430"," I agree with this. "
"19359550","19362850"," Of course we're going to have a recession, at least one in the next nine."
"19362910","19366230"," They will likely be the reason for that recession to kick in."
"19366410","19371370"," If we run hot for five years, you're going to see retired folk that aren't going to be able to"
"19371370","19372250"," keep up. "
"19372250","19373190"," They could be the..."
"19373190","19375570"," I agree with this to a point."
"19375790","19381070"," There's a growing acknowledgement, at least around the edges of the political population of the"
"19381070","19383150"," politicals, that they realize that..."
"19383150","19388890"," If you do get that debt cycle end, the end of debt cycle in this whole thing, this whole disaster"
"19388890","19398050"," that we have, you'd have to keep inflation just high enough to price those people out."
"19398050","19399490"," Point inflationary. "
"19399690","19402490"," I think we talked about this last time two weeks ago."
"19402870","19411110"," When forced to choose, they're going to give up the inflation to take care of a growing"
"19411110","19414250"," unemployment problem and a growing economic divot."
"19414430","19415890"," I agree with some of this. "
"19416110","19417430"," Because they always do."
"19418470","19420630"," Let's leave the first segment there and take a quick break."
"19420630","19421270"," That's a fair point. "
"19421430","19421970"," I like that point."
"19421970","19425990"," We'll talk some strategy more of it with Jeffrey Gunlock on the other side."
"19425990","19428130"," Let's get to our Twitter question of the day while we're at it. "
"19428210","19431650"," We want to know, do you think the Fed will cut rates this year?"
"19432330","19433590"," Let me turn that off for a minute."
"19433790","19434610"," That was a pretty good interview."
"19434970","19436310"," I don't disagree with some of what he said. "
"19438170","19442790"," If you're going to look for where the crack is, it probably is with older folks."
"19444570","19447590"," They're not just pensions like their retirements."
"19447790","19452530"," I spent into a 401k or I took an early retirement. "
"19453670","19459190"," If they can't keep up, they could be that last waterfall that a bear is looking for."
"19459790","19466430"," If they're going to support, we've talked about this with politics in the election cycle and this"
"19466430","19470910"," whole like we're doing the 1950s, 1970s again, along does that last."
"19473450","19479310"," Specifically, how Fed Chair Powell came up in the last rate decision meeting and that it's looking"
"19479310","19487300"," like with the support, supportive banks and it'll end up being commercial backed securities,"
"19488040","19489060"," mortgage backed securities. "
"19489600","19490780"," You're going to see the support there."
"19491400","19493280"," You're going to see commercial real estate get supported."
"19493800","19495280"," That just extends all this shit. "
"19497040","19498520"," It's going to be a weird recession."
"19498980","19500000"," It's going to be a weird one."
"19501180","19505420"," It's going to be a one where a lot of people will get by very well, do very well for"
"19505420","19505820"," themselves. "
"19506680","19509420"," You really need them to like, it's going to take time."
"19520770","19522470"," Yeah, I think that's going to be doomed too."
"19522710","19523370"," I can agree with that. "
"19523830","19526970"," It would be a no brainer to come out and just pump this shit, right?"
"19527130","19528890"," Have like a Reagan guy come out and run for president."
"19529890","19531170"," Like make all kinds of stupid promises."
"19531730","19532890"," We all were living with inflation. "
"19533430","19534790"," That would be the other flip of that coin, right?"
"19538580","19543300"," You hold off long enough to get the legacy to people that did this stuff and they replace everybody"
"19543300","19544560"," in the next election cycle."
"19545320","19546820"," We've talked about that extensively too."
"19547240","19550360"," Because you are, you're going to have these older people that are going to go vote. "
"19550560","19552380"," They vote and they're going to vote to keep their money."
"19574380","19576640"," A little bit of selling here into this close right now."
"19576760","19580140"," We know we've got three ninety eights, a bunch of three ninety eights. "
"19580180","19583340"," It's not going to want to print those or if they do, they're going to try to wear them down"
"19583340","19584180"," until we get into this close."
"19587080","19588260"," We're in this really weird place."
"19588300","19589760"," You kind of have to rent it all out. "
"19590100","19594480"," We talk about it on the show all the time and I'm like, it's kind of complicated."
"19594660","19603900"," Well, it's not complicated, but you know, you know, it's like, it's like, we're going to, like the"
"19603900","19604260"," whole thing."
"19604360","19607620"," Like we're going to support people to be working, right?"
"19610180","19611480"," We're going to force people to work. "
"19611620","19613720"," You're going to, if you're poor, you're going to pay for this."
"19614300","19615560"," You're going to pay to support the banks."
"19615680","19618800"," You're going to pay to support all that commercial real estate. "
"19618900","19620160"," You're going to be supporting that too."
"19620860","19626260"," And until we get all that back, all that shit supported, just work your ass off and then we'll do"
"19626260","19627320"," the rug pull down the road."
"19630690","19632150"," Or you're going to accept inflation. "
"19633630","19637150"," Well, your eggs are never coming down, but an election cycle will fix that for you."
"19637730","19638750"," It's really fucked up."
"19642090","19648650"," If you're young and you're looking for pay where marching towards the road of doing the right"
"19648650","19653530"," thing, you kind of got the shaft this past couple of weeks. "
"19653590","19654470"," You really did."
"19654590","19655070"," You got the shaft."
"19657150","19660850"," If you're older, you're likely going to extend you getting the shaft. "
"19662410","19663530"," So it'll be like long and painful."
"19665290","19667690"," But I don't know that it's like a normal recession."
"19668230","19670590"," Like the mechanics aren't right for the normal recession. "
"19670770","19671670"," It's going to take longer."
"19676750","19678090"," And that brings up the war."
"19678730","19680310"," That brings up war too, right?"
"19680430","19684490"," It brings up the reality of if there is a real war in this country. "
"19688350","19690510"," You would expect that if we stay the course."
"19704410","19705410"," I think they pin it."
"19706530","19712090"," I'm going to bet that they pin like 39798 or 99 or something crazy in this close. "
"19714690","19721990"," The only other risk that I would say there is to bulls here is just be careful for like sell"
"19721990","19722350"," side."
"19723130","19725630"," But dramaturators, they can't get it under during the daytime."
"19726550","19728430"," They can't get underneath this in the daytime. "
"19728670","19729950"," They slip it under at nighttime."
"19731910","19733470"," So maybe a better gift by tomorrow morning."
"19734710","19736010"," The conscience of that. "
"19736450","19738030"," Let's look at what the positioning is for tomorrow."
"19747350","19748310"," It's 398C."
"19748510","19749590"," There's 100,000 contracts. "
"19753030","19753470"," Oh, there's some."
"19753770","19756250"," Dude, there's a whole bunch of puts."
"19758410","19760530"," And a whole bunch of calls for 29. "
"19761790","19766070"," They got to look on SPX right now and check SPX is positioning."
"19766070","19772850"," Let me do some stuff in the background here."
"19784470","19786690"," Yeah, these fucking bears, man. "
"19787190","19788530"," They're buying puts again."
"19790950","19792570"," You keep buying puts bears."
"19792790","19797630"," This shouldn't crash in fucking bears, man. "
"19798490","19799490"," Keep buying puts."
"19799770","19800690"," Just keep on buying puts."
"19801190","19801910"," Keep on buying. "
"19807510","19809130"," Let me see here."
"19809350","19809630"," Let me look."
"19810270","19811570"," Keep on buying puts. "
"19814890","19816850"," We grind this shit way higher."
"19819870","19821550"," Keep on buying puts."
"19821870","19822370"," Keep doing it. "
"19825250","19827910"," We're going to squeeze higher and keep doing that shit."
"19836380","19837800"," One of the int..."
"19837800","19838700"," Well, so intraday stuff."
"19840550","19841420"," It's implied ball. "
"19842440","19843900"," Because that shit doesn't get counted."
"19868720","19869820"," Oh, yeah, man."

"19913570","19913930"," All right. "
"19914130","19914870"," Maybe I'll buy some calls."

"19937580","19939500"," I don't know if it's IWM or Spy that does better."
"19948050","19952230"," Did we get that gap up on Spy tomorrow?"
"19954110","19955690"," Kind of pending this close. "
"19958710","19961130"," I wonder if I just buy the dip on the open tomorrow in Spy."
"19961870","19964850"," It might just be something better to buy the open tomorrow in Spy."
"19968350","19971250"," Like buy the fucking open on Spy or buy the close today. "
"19972230","19973890"," I'm interested in some calls for tomorrow."
"19977810","19980850"," My initial thought here is to just buy them right now."
"19983990","19986650"," But I'd really like to fucking buy them down here. "
"19987250","19988570"," Or even the open tomorrow."
"19998120","20004050"," Yeah, I agree, Jimmy."
"20004530","20005550"," I'm not in them right now. "
"20005590","20007190"," I should have grabbed them just then and I didn't."
"20010870","20016560"," I'm looking at the 400 C's for tomorrow."
"20023420","20025740"," Market squeezing and they're going down right now. "
"20049450","20054980"," Yeah, there's like, there's like this weirdness for tomorrow."
"20055640","20055700"," Like."
"20057920","20061260"," You just get the gap up overnight and be done with it and you're left behind. "
"20062180","20065820"," Or it's like a roll in the overnight and then the real trades higher."
"20066260","20067900"," I just bought some calls so."
"20070100","20074320"," I don't like the idea of these calls here not closing in the money. "
"20077500","20079660"," So I just I just bought some for tomorrow."
"20080540","20084020"," My assumption is not to buy these things two or three times."
"20088460","20090620"," I might have to buy them two or three times. "
"20091660","20096340"," So like they're like here and then here and then fucking maybe the open tomorrow."
"20100230","20104430"," We can't tell if it's like down here or if it's or if it's the open tomorrow."
"20105390","20106490"," I added some though. "
"20108170","20109690"," I'll let him pick around in the background."
"20115110","20116610"," I'll tell you two things here."
"20118330","20120270"," I added some calls in here. "
"20122490","20126150"," I'm going to be looking to add some maybe even higher strike if we if we roll down in this"
"20126150","20126690"," close here."
"20127590","20131570"," We're looking to buy buy some more maybe just more in the money shit like three ninety five."
"20132090","20134170"," And that'd be what if we sell off in the overnight. "
"20134330","20135670"," I'd be willing to buy the open tomorrow to."
"20140830","20142410"," There's a three bar trade here, right?"
"20143530","20145690"," By the way, I'm showing a three bar three bar trade."
"20146470","20149690"," Spy is spy depending on this clothes is showing a three bar trade. "
"20150010","20150950"," If the clothes is higher."
"20152010","20153830"," You get the three bar trade in tomorrow."
"20155250","20157130"," 38 million to the south side. "
"20157510","20162050"," The one thing I don't like here is the all the calls that are sitting up here in the money."
"20164950","20168130"," It's the only thing that I see that's bad or what's bad to it."
"20168770","20169670"," Some long here tomorrow. "
"20173450","20175770"," Yeah, you have to do DCA or something."
"20176170","20177290"," There's some risk here for sure."
"20179630","20183310"," But even with the risk the payoff the payoff is probably going to like. "
"20184510","20187230"," Like whenever cuts are in here there's probably a payoff."
"20190100","20191160"," Whether it's there tomorrow."
"20202410","20203270"," Keep an eye on it. "
"20204250","20206110"," If it rolls too much, I'll cut them loose."
"20214010","20216570"," So just if you're going to follow me on this trade, you shouldn't."
"20216710","20218350"," Number one, this is not financial advice. "
"20218930","20220230"," Number two, do your own due diligence."
"20220490","20222810"," Number three, consult a financial person."
"20223610","20224390"," Financial advisor. "
"20224830","20227850"," Now for myself, what I'm doing here is I'm long into this close."
"20228790","20229690"," If it rolls over."
"20231470","20237070"," I'll cut loose and try to buy down here after the after the after the close or something. "
"20238870","20240570"," And I'll hold a position overnight."
"20241130","20245510"," If if those burn, I'll just buy the open tomorrow."
"20245830","20246670"," There's a trade here. "
"20246770","20248010"," There's a three bar trade here for sure."
"20250830","20251770"," There's a three bar trade."
"20252250","20254810"," There's a three bar trade firming up in here. "
"20255170","20255330"," So."

"20266130","20270010"," Let me look at spy daily real quick here in the background."

"20668550","20671410"," It's a smart man saying that he's not allowed in. "
"20671690","20673530"," I said we are going to do a blanket."
"20673950","20676290"," Allow everybody back into the discord at some point here."
"20680570","20683590"," Yeah, I think the only thing that so if I do one today if I do a blanket. "

"20728870","20729610"," Not for everybody."
"20729910","20733050"," Just for the people that are banned consistently consecutively over and over."

"20749770","20751530"," You know, I didn't know the rules. "
"20752870","20757070"," What can I do to not offend or defend the rules or whatever?"
"20757770","20760390"," Or how can we do this so that I don't break rules anymore?"
"20761670","20762490"," Try to be helpful."
"20762790","20763610"," I guess would be the key."
"20764930","20769530"," If you're just going to, you know, if that's not the case, not going to happen, then we'll just. "
"20770150","20771350"," You get paid to be there."
"20771530","20774710"," I'm assuming if you paid 300 bucks to be there, you wouldn't break any more rules."
"20774990","20775630"," I guarantee it. "
"20776810","20779630"," Pay like three, four, five hundred bucks or something like that to be there."

"20809160","20811900"," So I'll call you wife's boyfriend after the show."
"20812400","20815040"," And I'll try to get that room designed today."
"20815440","20819520"," So there should be a room that when you come into the discord, you go into this room and you"
"20819520","20820680"," read everything first. "
"20821240","20824980"," You agree to it and then you allowed into the main rooms or whatever."
"20825520","20826940"," And we don't have that right now."
"20828340","20831260"," So I need to have like a room to let these people back in. "
"20831480","20834080"," They have to read everything and abide by the rules."
"20835240","20837040"," So maybe it's going to take me a few hours."
"20838400","20842440"," It's probably going to take me three or four hours to get a room up and running for people to"
"20842440","20843520"," come back into the discord. "
"20852020","20853140"," That people are still confused."
"20858150","20859610"," They just don't want to agree to the rules."
"20859610","20860230"," Yeah. "
"20860770","20865430"," That's the thing is like if you're not agreeing to the rules, then this isn't the discord for you."
"20866390","20867250"," I got to be honest."
"20878750","20879610"," Yeah, I got to be honest. "
"20879810","20880990"," It would be like a permanent ban."
"20882850","20884110"," That would be the craziest part."
"20884390","20889110"," I guess that's the thing is you didn't end up getting a permanent ban. "
"20896660","20897060"," Yeah."
"20897080","20902160"," Mr. talking monkey saying, yeah, they do do the read the rules to activate account entry."
"20902860","20904540"," They just don't want to agree to the rules. "
"20905660","20906020"," Yeah."
"20906140","20910140"," So I guess my question to you is if you're if you're watching or listening right now and you've"
"20910140","20910720"," been banned."
"20911740","20915580"," Do you think that if I on ban, you're not just going to get banned again and then I'll be"
"20915580","20915900"," permanent?"
"20916680","20917600"," Is that what you want?"
"20917760","20920780"," Does this be banned permanently or trying to figure this out here?"
"20921320","20922660"," I don't quite understand the. "
"20928020","20928380"," Yeah."
"20928700","20929220"," You know what I'm saying?"
"20929360","20931180"," I'm like, is it something where you just want to come in?"
"20931300","20932500"," I guess that's fine too."
"20932500","20935480"," If you just want to come in to get me like, yeah, fuck all of you and I got banned. "
"20935900","20936580"," That's funny."
"20936820","20937000"," I guess."
"20951340","20952500"," Do you know what I mean?"
"20959830","20962130"," Well, I think maybe where you have to clarify the rules. "
"20963570","20966850"," I think there's I was in there last week and it seemed better."
"20967070","20968610"," Like it seemed like there's a bear down."
"20968790","20970970"," There's a bull pen or something. "
"20970970","20974890"," There's places for Globex traders, futures traders."
"20976270","20978050"," The one thing I will say this."
"20978570","20980330"," I will say this. "
"20980510","20986610"," At some point it's going to become a part of the package for the for the for the for the"
"20986610","20986610"," website."
"20987050","20990990"," So I don't want to say on that."
"20991090","20997310"," I know I know in the background, I don't discuss this often, but when something is free, people"
"20997310","20998410"," take advantage of it. "
"20998910","21002070"," When you start to charge for people to be there, people take things seriously."
"21002850","21003270"," It's a weird."
"21003630","21008290"," It's this weird thing that people need to pay to take things seriously. "
"21010090","21014410"," And so I mean, it's going, it's moving in that direction."
"21015290","21016950"," We're going in that direction right now."
"21026780","21030220"," Is there not a general conversation room right now or is there isn't there?"
"21030820","21033400"," Is there like a daily threat or something that you can say whatever you want?"
"21041580","21042680"," Yeah, I'll have to look at it again. "
"21045310","21046510"," I'll have to look at it again today."
"21053350","21053670"," Yeah."
"21054090","21057910"," If I'm a futures trader, I just want to go in a futures room. "
"21058150","21058930"," I'll be honest with you."
"21059250","21060050"," I'm going to tell you exactly."
"21060430","21061270"," I've paid for these room. "
"21061390","21062910"," I've paid for these discords in the past."
"21063090","21063430"," Big money."
"21064410","21068030"," And if I'm trading, if I'm trading futures, I want to be in the futures room and I want to"
"21068030","21068550"," take it seriously. "
"21069830","21073070"," If there's like a main room that I can ship post in, I like that a lot."
"21073070","21077610"," If I want to go, you know, if I can ship post in the main room, I like that as"
"21077610","21077770"," well."
"21077990","21082650"," If I'm trading individual tickers, I want a serious room for that. "
"21083610","21088890"," If I'm trading the spy or SPX or ES, I want rooms for that."
"21093020","21094240"," And I'll be honest with you."
"21094300","21095140"," I've done that in the past. "
"21095660","21097840"," Sometimes some of those rooms only have three or four people in it."
"21098160","21099300"," Five people, 10 people."
"21099680","21100100"," And they're fine. "
"21100320","21101920"," I'm fine in those rooms with those people."
"21102440","21103760"," Usually they're serious trainers."
"21103920","21105580"," They're trading with serious money. "
"21106040","21109300"," And they don't need like 300 people in a room to trade futures."
"21109440","21113400"," You need like four or five, three trusted people that you trade with."
"21121090","21122230"," I'll look at it again tonight. "
"21123210","21124550"," I'll look at it with you."
"21124650","21126390"," My boyfriend's been doing a ton of work in the background."
"21126730","21130490"," So I'll look at it tonight and see what we'll take a walk through and see. "
"21130790","21135310"," Maybe I'll sign up with another with a new account or something and see what my experience is like."
"21150510","21150870"," Yeah."
"21150970","21151090"," Yeah. "
"21151350","21151550"," I agree."
"21151730","21152030"," Off center."
"21172880","21173240"," Yeah. "
"21173360","21174520"," I'll look at it again tonight."
"21174720","21176060"," We've been looking at it the past few weeks."
"21176160","21178080"," It's been a lot of work in the background going on. "
"21178540","21181360"," And you know, the funniest part is that's a free discord."
"21182060","21185400"," So my assumption is that the people that are working their asses off in there."
"21186300","21188020"," Are being trampled over. "
"21188160","21189920"," That's my, that's my base case right there."
"21190380","21191420"," That's what I think is happening."
"21192680","21195020"," You know, people are in there spending time working on this stuff. "
"21195020","21201560"," And then there's no like, um, you know, there has to be like cooperation versus, you know, fuck"
"21201560","21203200"," that guy or that guy's doing this."
"21203340","21207300"," You're part of the, like you already know when you're part of the team or not, right?"
"21207540","21210540"," You know, when you're like, well, I don't like that person or I don't like this and I don't like"
"21210540","21210840"," that."
"21211200","21213460"," So I'm just going to cause problems or trouble. "
"21241500","21241860"," Yeah."
"21241980","21245620"," You know, like, so Nick, that's the saying your wife boyfriend said you'd have rules months ago."
"21246000","21248260"," This kind of stuff right here is hilarious to read. "
"21255730","21260650"," Yeah, I'm going to have to get a, I'm going to have to have Quinn to seek out VPNs in"
"21260650","21261010"," there too."
"21269020","21272580"," People refuse to use common sense and they come in here and bring it up, which the real is the"
"21272580","21272860"," stream."
"21273380","21276320"," Find that as a valuable offense to complain in live stream about discord. "
"21276640","21279720"," Yeah, I don't like the complaining in chat about it."
"21280040","21285460"," But, you know, there's not going to be like, I'm going to go to Captain Jim James and like I'm"
"21285460","21289420"," going to go to dad and he's going to overrule mom or something like that either."
"21292130","21295490"," But I think that they get, I think that ultimately you give everybody one blanket. "
"21296370","21300130"," Let back in one more time and then we, we start banning them for the last time forever."
"21300670","21302510"," And there's no more discussion from that point, right?"
"21303030","21304950"," And they've read, they've read the rules and that kind of stuff."
"21305290","21313340"," And we've done what we were supposed to do on our end here about the shooting in Tennessee. "
"21313640","21314300"," No, it didn't hurt about it."
"21314420","21315180"," Everybody's shooting is a Tennessee."
"21317060","21320500"," Yeah, we have a three strikes out rule timeout pre ban ban. "
"21320680","21323300"," So is everybody here gone through three strikes rule out rule?"
"21323300","21329130"," Who just said in a, is it, do we have like three strikes out?"
"21329450","21330010"," What's this thing?"
"21330150","21333350"," We have three strikes out rule timeout pre ban ban."
"21343690","21344990"," Did you guys all get that?"
"21348290","21350310"," Do you guys all get those three strikes or no?"
"21353630","21357610"," Mark's on close imbalance, currently sitting at one spot four billion to the south side."
"21357770","21368070"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"21376950","21378530"," Mr. Ed realized profits."
"21382190","21386330"," Oh, trading down to the close three ninety six forty four right now into the daily trigger and"
"21386330","21386830"," weekly trigger."
"21394010","21395670"," Just added to a position here. "
"21396510","21399970"," So I had two places to buy here place above place right here."
"21400390","21402490"," And then I'm looking to buy the open tomorrow as well."
"21403210","21406590"," Talked about a futures trade is trying to get it underneath this daily trigger. "
"21407250","21411330"," Some now long for forty three cents on four hundred C for tomorrow as well."
"21413790","21415730"," Forty three and seventy or something like that."
"21421990","21423910"," You read what some of you guys are posting in the. "
"21424330","21428710"," If you don't know what you did wrong, it's just an unfair ban."
"21431290","21433550"," Let me see, especially if no rules are posted."
"21438230","21439270"," Yeah, I'm gonna have to go through. "
"21439430","21441810"," You know what I might do here too is, you know, we could do."
"21442930","21447810"," You know, we could do is we could reset the entire discord."
"21449550","21451390"," I'll look at the room there. "
"21451750","21453350"," Like everybody come back in once more."
"21453770","21454430"," Fresh and clean."
"21454570","21455370"," We'll just start charging. "
"21460680","21462140"," That way everybody reads the rules."
"21462580","21463640"," Everybody reads the rules."
"21464840","21466080"," And then it's fairly simple. "
"21466580","21470600"," And then I can pay these guys to run the discord."
"21475420","21476140"," I'm gonna keep it simple."
"21476140","21479040"," The same discord you just get kicked out and you come back in. "
"21489690","21493730"," Yeah, what I'll do is what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in and what I'll do is I'll"
"21493730","21496930"," sign up for an account like a fake account."
"21496930","21500310"," Not a fake, but you know, like an account and I'll enter the discord."
"21500550","21505150"," I'll like enter through an invite and I'll walk through the entire thing and see what it looks like"
"21505150","21507050"," and how the interaction is that kind of stuff. "
"21508050","21514170"," And I'll try to change my user profile a few times to see what rooms have this and what rooms"
"21514170","21515310"," have that and that kind of stuff."
"21532050","21535670"," Yeah, I don't think it's I think there's a I can see a lot of anger in the chat here"
"21535670","21539310"," and I'm not sure."
"21539550","21541430"," I shouldn't say I'm not sure. "
"21542210","21549750"," I'm not sure if it's mods that are power tripping or if it's misplaced posting or something like"
"21549750","21549950"," that."
"21550270","21551150"," I can't tell."
"21559630","21560550"," No, I'm sorry. "
"21560690","21562890"," It's definitely been it's going to be paid on the road."
"21562890","21563610"," I guarantee it."
"21564830","21565970"," One way or another. "
"21565970","21567170"," It's going to be part of the paid package."
"21567810","21568930"," It doesn't stay free."
"21585570","21587770"," No, it's it's definitely charged out down the road. "
"21587790","21589370"," It's definitely part of the package down the road."
"21589650","21590450"," It won't be free."
"21590510","21591250"," I can guarantee it. "
"21604210","21604610"," Thomas."
"21606310","21609130"," Yeah, I'm long here into the spell."
"21610470","21612270"," I'm actually green right now. "
"21612350","21613450"," I think I'm flat right now."
"21613530","21616710"," My calls for tomorrow trading 51 cents and four and C's for tomorrow."
"21627500","21628860"," Yeah, it's very difficult for mods. "
"21629100","21629640"," They don't have it easy."
"21630040","21631060"," They they work constantly."
"21631060","21632740"," I spend this past two weeks. "
"21632740","21640100"," I've spent 10 to 12 hours working on the discord with some of the mods and admins and we're still"
"21640100","21641240"," not there and done yet."
"21642200","21645780"," You know, all people go off and do whatever the fuck it is that they do in their real life."
"21646140","21651720"," So I've got no like no like care or anything for anyone that gets banned. "
"21652560","21658920"," I do have care for users in general, but they have a good smooth user experience."
"21659720","21662660"," They enjoy the discord and then they get something from it."
"21663480","21668420"," But I do have care for anyone that's back there moderating all day long period or adminting all day"
"21668420","21668640"," long. "
"21676630","21678190"," Disclaimer about here in California."
"21679610","21680610"," Thomas, you're the best."
"21687040","21695470"," Yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow. "
"21696670","21700970"," Yeah, just give me let me let me spend some time in here."
"21701210","21703270"," Oh, they're still still trying to sell me down to this bell."
"21703690","21704690"," Look at these guys. "
"21705230","21709150"," You know what's hilarious about this is you know how this is working itself out here."
"21710150","21714950"," You got all these all these future traders want to get underneath in an illiquid environment."
"21715190","21719150"," They want to get underneath the daily and the in the hourly and the overnight here. "
"21720030","21722230"," So I might have to reset this trade tomorrow."
"21722870","21725770"," They're not going to you can't do this in cash market."
"21725770","21728490"," So they're going to try to do it in the overnight here. "
"21729610","21730010"," Absolutely."
"21735600","21736700"," Yeah, see all you guys tomorrow."
"21738440","21742560"," As a beginner and likely also the future subscriber of them kick ass indicators are very much"
"21742560","21744980"," appreciate a structure discord such as laid out at the moment. "
"21745320","21746880"," The people in general won't read the rules."
"21746880","21751520"," So I would suggest a verbal warning guidance before a ban just a friendly suggestion."
"21751900","21754900"," Yeah, you know, like I think it's something where we're at a point. "
"21755740","21760220"," Where everyone needs to come back in going to this one room that says I'm going to read all these"
"21760220","21760480"," rules."
"21761260","21766560"," But then when you enter, you know what the rules are the rules are and you have a place that"
"21766560","21767460"," you can do things."
"21768360","21773960"," That you want to do like I have not I'm not I'm not anti like hey, I like to ship"
"21773960","21775800"," post about the market burning. "
"21776060","21778440"," I'm not anti anything that you want to do."
"21778940","21780540"," I just want to give you a place to do it."
"21785120","21786600"," Why was Winky's room removed?"
"21786860","21787640"," I don't think that it was. "
"21789080","21791200"," I don't I don't know that Winky's room was removed."
"21792380","21794120"," You might not you might just not see it."
"21798690","21799950"," Let me see what you guys are saying here. "
"21816970","21819310"," Yeah, this is we talked about this happening earlier."
"21819450","21821130"," This is a futures thing right here."
"21821130","21825290"," They're going to try to sell this down and try to get it or any three ninety four by a."
"21826510","21830050"," By open tomorrow, but you can't get it done in cash markets. "
"21830190","21832350"," They're going to try to get it done right here by open tomorrow."
"21841910","21843330"," We see what you guys are saying up here."
"21851870","21853310"," Let me read some more of these saying here. "
"21864620","21865660"," I'll be honest with you."
