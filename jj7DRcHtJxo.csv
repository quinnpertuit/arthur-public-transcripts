"15400","16020"," Hold on."

"29190","30810"," What's going on out there?"
"35210","37050"," Oh, yeah."
"39730","42270"," Disappointments today, boys and girls. "
"42570","49640"," What's going on, baby?"
"51000","53120"," Turn this shit on."
"57880","60100"," Alright, I got that up right there."
"61720","65020"," They're they're they're they're they're. "
"65020","67300"," We got a lot to do today."
"70580","80520"," A lot to do today, probably some really, really upset bears this"
"80520","80940"," morning."
"80940","83740"," We got a lot to talk about. "
"85480","89420"," Boy, I was I was baiting someone."
"90080","97040"," Well, not baiting, like trying to catch someone off balance, but I threw a softball."
"97100","106180"," out there earlier in the week, asking about, you know, maximum employment robust employment"
"106180","108120"," in someone remembered. "
"108180","110360"," So I was pretty stoked on that."
"111060","112920"," Let's get right into it this morning."
"113960","120640"," So we have we have probably have a ton a ton to go over. "
"121000","122680"," Are the bulls out of the woods yet?"
"123460","123940"," No."
"125480","126660"," They are not."
"127380","129380"," We're in a really weird mechanically. "
"129500","133860"," We're we're in a place with a lot of cogs moving."
"135140","139880"," And it's I posted thread the needle."
"140100","144100"," It's going to be a really bizarre day bizarre weekend. "
"146060","148360"," Certainly coming up."
"149380","152220"," And it's just not going to Joe donuts in."
"154200","155620"," I was like. "
"157260","165840"," I was like, we haven't been as in as an exciting place as we are right now."
"166320","168120"," In some time."
"168780","170160"," It's been a while. "
"170360","170620"," It's been."
"173040","176060"," Maybe the the spiciest."
"177040","179700"," The spiciest time was. "
"180960","182200"," There was a week or two."
"182200","183660"," or two or three in December."
"185600","188340"," We should probably look at that if we have a chance today. "
"190860","192000"," I think it was December."
"192220","194960"," There was like a two or three week consolidation coiling pattern."
"196480","198540"," And we were actually at risk. "
"199320","201580"," We were at some market risk for a crash."
"202920","209360"," That was the last time I can recall where there was where things were really spicy like where are"
"209360","209760"," we going."
"210380","218460"," And a lot of the market was positioned for a major down move and they got wrecked. "
"218680","219320"," They got destroyed."
"219940","223000"," So I think it was December."
"223240","224600"," I think it was like sometime in December. "
"224800","231980"," I think the rut was falling off and I think even Baba Yaga and I were talking about it or"
"231980","238480"," something at one point and it was a really precarious."
"239020","243260"," Like people thought a crash and rightfully so."
"243720","246180"," And hold on. "
"246340","247040"," Make sure you got this right."
"247680","248320"," You do so."
"248400","249380"," I got to do some stuff in the background. "
"250460","251200"," Rightfully so."
"251340","254840"," And we were actually in some real danger whether you are a bullish or not."
"255500","260480"," And you had to be you had to be aware of it. "
"261540","264560"," So last night I posted something else."
"264720","273780"," I said the best part about flash crashes is best part of flash crashes is that you never see them"
"273780","274160"," coming."
"274900","279080"," No one ever tells you about a flash crash. "
"280460","284360"," It's funny someone was someone famous was like this reminds me of 1987."
"286440","290840"," And no I'm sorry it doesn't remind you of 1987."
"291760","293100"," No one saw that coming. "
"293520","299000"," A lot like I'm talking like flash crash like boom straight down and whether it lasts one two three"
"299000","301380"," four five days you're not anticipating it."
"302120","307300"," There isn't like a there isn't like a JPM guy going out there to tell you."
"308220","309520"," Hey we're gonna crash. "
"310520","314660"," And you should sell the farm and follow that."
"316760","319820"," So you know normally that kind of stuff is unseen."
"321000","322840"," So you know. "
"323560","329800"," But we got a lot to talk about today because there is still risk here for bulls and some real"
"329800","330240"," danger."
"330760","335300"," There's like we're gonna have a discussion about Jerome Powell is higher for longer."
"336200","343920"," The unemployment rate the employment rates we have to talk about who's betting against the Powell"
"343920","348180"," said the last rate increase we got to talk about but we got a lot to talk about today. "
"348500","353500"," It's it is some it's not really implication implications."
"353580","358060"," It's what what really matters to the market."
"358060","359880"," We'll talk about here in a few moments. "
"359880","360880"," We do one quick thing here."
"361240","365460"," So hold on one second here."
"365640","366240"," What was this?"
"366480","372710"," Oh I gotta I gotta do this like stupid production stuff in the background. "
"374090","375150"," You one quick second."
"375590","378310"," So there's a but there's a lot of play here is the point."
"378550","381770"," So we're gonna try to dissect it simply for you. "
"381990","384230"," Try to keep it simple for you."
"384750","394730"," I know that people like to complicate over-complicate make things cloudy and foggy."
"395950","404790"," You know like use esoteric words and phrases sound smart but it doesn't really matter to you as an"
"404790","406050"," equity trader right. "
"407230","411670"," You just have to understand the concepts right what really matters."
"412410","417930"," Okay so let's talk about those numbers."
"418130","419290"," Well let's let's talk about a few things. "
"419470","420230"," Let's start at the top."
"421230","422750"," Let me be at the top."
"422990","424950"," Let's let's let's talk about something important. "
"425790","430770"," So if you remember the purple line down here too."
"431290","433030"," So they tagged this in pre-market."
"434510","436850"," Bounced ran it back up into the hourly trigger. "
"438230","439730"," But maybe not the exact beginning."
"439870","443370"," We're not talking about the rates just yet or the or the or the rate decision."
"444710","449370"," But we are going to talk about what I talked to you about earlier this week on the stream. "
"450950","458260"," And what I talked about to you to you about earlier this week in the stream was what the fuck"
"458260","461100"," and who the fuck is bitching on fin twit."
"461820","466490"," I was like who's bitching on fin twit."
"466650","473090"," I was like I'm on fin twit and all I'm reading right now are a bunch of whining cry babies. "
"474410","475890"," Who are those people."
"476170","477650"," I asked that question earlier this week."
"478630","479930"," I was like are these rich people. "
"480670","484490"," I was like are you making more than three hundred thousand dollars a year and you're whining and"
"484490","485010"," bitching."
"487940","490340"," I remember that conversation earlier this week."
"491500","497920"," That that that that conversation was directed towards people with a goddamn job. "
"499840","503480"," Who's whining and who's bitching on fin twit."
"503720","505900"," And I asked that question earlier this week."
"506400","511520"," Who's whining who's doing the bitching and what are they whining about and"
"511520","517039"," what are they detail. "
"517820","520280"," Talked about foreclosures."
"520280","522840"," Talked about being laid off."
"523460","527320"," Talked about not being able to pay for your shitbag husband at home. "
"530980","533240"," And why that matters."
"534000","535960"," And who's doing the bitching."
"536880","538420"," Who's doing the whining. "
"539280","544880"," Is it some asshole with three jobs or one job or two jobs."
"545920","551780"," Is it some asshole that got laid off but was given another job that pays the same or an extra"
"551780","554440"," two or three jobs but is still paying their bills."
"555060","556080"," You got to remember here. "
"557320","558820"," You got to remember here."
"559560","561600"," Now it's not nice to say these things."
"562400","566280"," And I don't you know this isn't me but let's look at it. "
"566740","569160"," You got people whining and bitching on fin twit."
"569600","570240"," Crying."
"571060","573400"," Tearing what our hard life is. "
"574280","577680"," We know that that does not fucking matter to the equity market."
"578580","580580"," What matters to the equity market."
"581660","584160"," Is not the inverted yield curve. "
"585400","590300"," The most consistent measure of where we're going."
"591620","593160"," Policy all of it."
"593620","597140"," We we can't we we we were talking to Joe about how you can't see. "
"597820","601340"," I'm talking to Joe yesterday about yesterday before."
"601500","602480"," You can't see."
"604100","606600"," The number of repos or excuse me. "
"606960","608560"," Bankrupt season foreclosures."
"609260","612240"," Before you see the unemployment and employment numbers."
"612240","613740"," Like you get those first. "
"615240","615880"," Right."
"616560","618940"," So they're a lagging indicator."
"620740","623100"," So is and we said this earlier this week. "
"623320","624160"," Anyone that's working."
"625040","625420"," Right."
"625600","628380"," The equity market doesn't fucking care. "
"629100","630860"," As long as you're working."
"631900","634380"," You're making money to pay your bills."
"635960","639640"," It's not good or it's it's not good for the bear case. "
"640440","640840"," Right."
"641260","645900"," You have to have the people that are whining and bitching."
"646360","647720"," Not working. "
"648260","650380"," They have to be unemployed."
"651180","654380"," Laid off and unable to get more work."
"654960","656640"," Of the same or higher pay. "
"656920","657000"," Right."
"658380","662940"," So when these people are whining and bitching on fen to it this past week."
"664000","667680"," You have to ask who is that that's whining and bitching. "
"668000","669600"," Is it someone in foreclosure."
"678700","685400"," Is it is her husband divorcing her because that ship bag stays at home."
"685460","686160"," He doesn't do shit. "
"686400","686480"," Right."
"686880","691700"," Now she can't afford to take care of the kids and the 2.5 kids and the white pig fence"
"691700","695740"," and the house and the what the husband's the ship bag at home and all that stuff."
"695780","698720"," So and that was the question I asked earlier this week. "
"699320","700880"," Who is bitching."
"702340","704420"," Because as far as Wall Street is concerned."
"705140","706340"," As long as you're working. "
"707440","707960"," Right."
"708060","708940"," As long as you're working."
"708940","709900"," You got your job. "
"710260","711640"," You're paying your mortgage."
"713040","714580"," You're not getting a divorce."
"715500","716620"," All that kind of stuff. "
"716620","717780"," You're not living out of your car."
"719020","719960"," Nothing wrong."
"720160","720340"," Right. "
"720700","721460"," There's nothing wrong."
"721720","726860"," So this is kind of trying to be trying to be humorous here and probably angering some people this"
"726860","727080"," morning."
"727080","731420"," But I'm not trying to I'm trying to take the the devil's advocate. "
"732800","737580"," The bad guys from Wall Street and the bad guys from the Fed and the bad guys from the Senate"
"737580","740120"," and your house of representatives."
"740120","741540"," And let's be honest."
"742800","748740"," Until you're in pain and I don't mean I don't mean you going on fin to it and bitching about"
"748740","754020"," the price of goods or services or your mortgage or the rates or any of that kind of stuff. "
"755940","758740"," But when you finally go out there and you're in real pain."
"759840","765220"," And you change your tomb from all the rates are too high for me."
"766080","772220"," And you change your tune to going on fin to it and saying I fucking lost my my wife my"
"772220","773200"," dog my kids. "
"773700","775340"," They took the cats."
"776060","777440"," I'm living out of my car."
"778120","780580"," I was an engineer and I don't have a goddamn job anymore. "
"781120","783140"," I'm working at McDonald's Wendy's."
"786180","790820"," And 711 and I'm delivering pizzas on the side from Uber or something."
"791500","792720"," Like that's what I want to hear. "
"793560","795140"," I want to hear that."
"795660","797180"," Why do I want to hear that?"
"798240","800340"," Why do I want to hear?"
"801340","802680"," You can no longer pay your bills."
"803280","804100"," You've been fired. "
"804660","805380"," You've been laid off."
"805920","807600"," You've got no job opportunities."
"808560","811800"," You're now in foreclosure. "
"812000","812980"," Why do I want to know that stuff?"
"813820","818820"," Because that's the unemployment rate rising and jobs available going away."
"820160","829940"," And the only only measure that you can really like if you were to pin"
"829940","832960"," something like well is it rates?"
"834700","835340"," No."
"836040","836760"," Is it inflation?"
"837800","837860"," Nope. "
"839540","844120"," Is it is it the tens of the twos?"
"844180","844380"," Nope."
"844980","847060"," Is it the threes and the tens?"
"847860","848000"," Nope."
"848560","849520"," What is it?"
"850080","855820"," It's always the unemployment rate and the jobs available, right?"
"856020","856620"," Employment unemployment. "
"857700","861500"," It's the most it's it's the most consistent historically."
"861880","863400"," You can do this on your own."
"864040","867740"," You can go right to a trading view chart, bring up the unemployment rate. "
"868920","871080"," And it's it's the most it's the most like consistent."
"872500","873500"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"873700","877880"," Like, yeah, you can rely upon the inverted yield curve like 60% of the time."
"878400","880820"," But not 80, 90 to 100% of the time. "
"881420","885520"," I know you can rely upon 80, 90% of the time, 100% of the time."
"885960","887920"," It's the employment to unemployment numbers."
"888320","896680"," That one is that's the one that's the that's not so when you see numbers like that today, right,"
"896720","899000"," you're gonna have people out there say these are fudged, right?"
"899160","900380"," You know, you're gonna hear that from people. "
"900820","902560"," Those numbers are fudged today."
"903980","906900"," You know, whether they're fudged or not, it doesn't matter."
"907700","913820"," What does matter is that we still have some kind of robust employment. "
"915080","921260"," What that tells me is that all that whining and bitching on fin Twitter earlier in the week was"
"921260","924320"," just some asshole that has to go back to work and work harder."
"924860","928260"," So get your ass back to work and start working until you get laid off, right?"
"928800","929480"," That's not me."
"929600","930620"," I think that's cruel to say. "
"930820","933540"," But that's really where we are, aren't we?"
"934800","937840"," Stop it and get back to work, pleb."
"939320","940380"," Cog in the machine."
"941900","946920"," You know, it's pretty shitty to say that, but it's true. "
"947980","950300"," You know, you got your wine out."
"950420","957140"," Now go back to work, pick up a third job, start delivering, I don't know, start delivering KFC."
"957140","965220"," See, I don't know, KFC, I don't know, but"
"965220","971700"," you know, it sucks because these numbers are saying that you're actually working. "
"972380","973640"," It says you're all working."
"974020","976140"," It says you're working really mighty fine and mighty hard."
"976780","977560"," That's what you're doing. "
"981480","983260"," So that's not what we want to see, right?"
"983920","991780"," And so we've got, we got these numbers that come out here and the, let's talk about those numbers"
"991780","1000740"," because you got the Fed Chair saying we're going to raise at least two more times, right?"
"1000960","1002060"," I remember hearing that."
"1002280","1004100"," Everybody else says one time, right?"
"1005060","1010320"," But I remember him saying possible one or two 25 basis point raises."
"1010760","1016160"," And he said, we're going to hold him in a December, likely December of 2024. "
"1016620","1019880"," Now that's some of that's been backpedaled by the newspapers, right?"
"1020340","1021680"," Talk about that earlier this week."
"1022060","1024220"," They were trying to sweep that under the carpet, right?"
"1026560","1036420"," And Jamie Diamond saying, or higher than we even think higher for even longer than December."
"1038240","1043980"," And if you look at the chart of unemployment, if you follow the trend up, it said the unemployment"
"1043980","1050780"," rate is saying, fuck, no, we're going to go to six or 7% unemployment by December of 2024. "
"1052300","1054040"," So someone's wrong here, right?"
"1054820","1058320"," And the numbers that come out today kind of point towards that, right?"
"1058860","1067880"," Just for today, just for today, not down the road, just for today, is saying, maybe that maybe"
"1067880","1071160"," maybe we won't have six or seven percent unemployment in December 2024."
"1071880","1074880"," Maybe we are going to hold higher for longer."
"1075420","1078460"," Maybe Diamond or Dimon is right, right?"
"1079340","1087960"," Now a bear or a seller or whoever said this week, you got big names, right?"
"1088140","1096140"," Bill Ackman, Dimon, you got Wilson, you got Marco, you got all these people out there, you got"
"1096140","1100300"," people like, we're going to take Jerome to task, right?"
"1101500","1107320"," So if you're a bear or a seller out there, what you want is higher unemployment. "
"1108600","1117160"," You want worse job opportunities, like you need that to challenge Jerome, right?"
"1117360","1127320"," So if Jerome's thinking higher for longer, right, to fight robust employment, then,"
"1127320","1133760"," you know, if he's saying we're going to raise and hold into December of 24 minimum and possibly"
"1133760","1143240"," longer, and if we continue to have great GDP, great unemployment, great"
"1143240","1150080"," employment, stay in that Goldilocks zone, then that does imply that we're going to raise or hold"
"1150080","1152040"," for longer until we break some shit."
"1153360","1163060"," It like pushes off any kind of a challenge or threat to the"
"1163060","1167240"," narrative of, no, we're not going to go higher for longer, right?"
"1167460","1172600"," You're wrong, Jerome, you'll be cutting by the time we get to December 2024."
"1174380","1179560"," So that's kind of bullish in the interim until we get different data. "
"1180340","1184920"," Now you've heard me say that Jerome shouldn't be out there showing charts that are 10 years out, a"
"1184920","1186240"," year out, two years out."
"1186700","1188440"," They don't mean shit, they really don't."
"1189060","1195640"," And you can see from the data this morning that it matters right now, but it's not going to matter"
"1195640","1196200"," next month. "
"1196200","1198060"," It's not going to matter the month after that either."
"1198480","1201620"," You trade what's in front of you, you trade with the data that's available."
"1202900","1206880"," So that's why I don't like Jerome's talking about that stuff that far down the road. "
"1207240","1213960"," And you can see just right now in today's numbers what's happening in the market, right?"
"1214200","1216580"," They didn't get their fucking market crash this morning."
"1216580","1217280"," Did they?"
"1217920","1220220"," They didn't get their market crash this morning."
"1220380","1222020"," These are not the numbers. "
"1223600","1227840"," Sorry, not the numbers that a bear wants to see."
"1228260","1230960"," If you don't know that, I'll say it point blank for you."
"1231880","1233480"," I don't care what you think. "
"1233920","1235380"," I'm telling you for sure."
"1236100","1238480"," These are not the numbers that bears want to see."
"1239880","1242520"," They want to see unemployment rising. "
"1242960","1246080"," They want to see employment dropping, right?"
"1246860","1247340"," Opportunities."
"1247440","1248280"," They want to see that curve."
"1248280","1250560"," Keep going up more and more and more and more. "
"1250920","1255140"," So they can front run those unemployment numbers exploding to the upside."
"1256120","1256900"," Does that make sense?"
"1257840","1259860"," Those unemployment numbers need to go up now."
"1260360","1266380"," Right now in this small microcosm, it's not good for a seller or a bear or a market crash person. "
"1267080","1268420"," Could that change next week?"
"1268660","1269040"," Fuck yeah."
"1269480","1272660"," And there's something looming above right now."
"1273320","1277440"," And I'm going to show it to you in just a few moments what's looming to the upside. "
"1278260","1280300"," And there's not a lot of time here for bulls."
"1281020","1284600"," Bulls have to literally thread a needle."
"1284660","1285820"," I'm going to turn that shit off. "
"1286000","1286200"," Hold on."
"1287100","1291220"," Bulls literally need to thread a needle to get out from this."
"1292080","1295780"," We're talking like move to the upside. "
"1297000","1298220"," Now do I think we're going to do that?"
"1298780","1299160"," I don't know."
"1299300","1302440"," I think we can still reverse come back down, get another low."
"1302640","1303220"," Believe it or not. "
"1304580","1305960"," I don't think we're done going down."
"1306100","1307120"," I'll be frank with you."
"1307240","1309240"," But if they can do it, they can do it. "
"1309300","1310300"," We'll we'll trade it."
"1310460","1310780"," I'm long."
"1311180","1314780"," So if you do take us there, I'm along for the ride. "
"1314800","1322280"," So and look at us blasting off right now, ripping to the upside above the hourly trigger going back"
"1322280","1325040"," to attack all this bullshit back here."
"1325220","1326780"," And we're going to try."
"1327040","1327860"," I'm going to show you some. "
"1328560","1333480"," We're going to try to make a move here in the market way up here."
"1334000","1335700"," 4 29 45."
"1336280","1337940"," You're going to see some squeezing going on. "
"1338500","1341280"," Marco fucked this morning."
"1342200","1343080"," Fuck you, Marco."
"1344140","1347240"," I'm talking to you about you, Marco at JPM. "
"1348060","1349720"," Guys always wrong."
"1350480","1351860"," Delio always wrong."
"1352220","1352600"," Great concepts. "
"1353580","1355260"," Always can't time shit."
"1355260","1362080"," I think Marco was like, I think Marco was like fucking bullish in 2022."
"1363000","1365120"," Fucking bearish in 2023. "
"1365620","1366760"," Like that guy's the spec."
"1366760","1369220"," I couldn't get side of a fucking barn if he tried."
"1370280","1370820"," Seriously. "
"1375920","1378120"," Couldn't hit the side of a fucking barn."
"1379620","1385660"," If you want somebody to go to the get a good go against, go against Marco matter, matter of fucking"
"1385660","1386300"," fact, right?"
"1386840","1388600"," At every bottom and every top."
"1389960","1391280"," Doing a Google search. "
"1391860","1394560"," Do a Google search every time we're at the top or a bottom."
"1394860","1398440"," Matter of fact, do a Google search of like March 20 fucking 20."
"1399500","1401720"," Do search of June 2020. "
"1403100","1407020"," He was like bearish as we fucking rip faces off for the rest of the year."
"1407670","1407940"," Please."
"1409920","1412580"," Go back and look at Ray Dalio, right?"
"1412800","1414060"," You want to see some funny ass shit?"
"1414660","1416340"," If you don't if you're not older like me. "
"1417000","1418320"," Ray Dalio, dude."
"1418600","1424160"," That guy comes out with shit every like he had like he had his pegs for the long term debt"
"1424160","1431300"," cycle starting like 10 fucking times the last 20 years 30 year maybe longer 30 40 years now 30"
"1431300","1435940"," fucking years that guy's been wrong giving he's got great concepts."
"1436500","1437640"," Ray Dalio love him. "
"1438380","1444300"," Great, easy way of explaining stuff to people but the timing get fucked like opposite side all"
"1444300","1445080"," times wrong."
"1450380","1452000"," So anyways."
"1456680","1459500"," Let's talk about some key points here this morning. "
"1459740","1460360"," Okay, number one."
"1460600","1463220"," So number one, the numbers are not in the bear's favor."
"1463520","1464420"," Okay, you got to know that. "
"1465060","1466360"," You need damage."
"1466720","1467600"," I need damage."
"1467840","1472700"," No, it's not good enough that you're not it's not good enough that you're working three jobs to pay"
"1472700","1473040"," your bills. "
"1473160","1473640"," I'm sorry."
"1474000","1479420"," I need you fucking homeless and divorced until I get that."
"1480000","1481140"," You don't get it. "
"1481240","1482280"," You don't get the crash."
"1482360","1483080"," I'm sorry."
"1483640","1486560"," That's the simplest I can make it. "
"1487160","1493920"," If you keep working and paying your bills, even if you have 18% credit cards, suck it up and"
"1493920","1495460"," get back to work until you get fired."
"1496060","1498640"," Man, it's so terrible to say it's like the worst thing in the world."
"1499860","1503200"," But that's what the fed that's the equity market. "
"1503580","1511160"," That's what everybody knows is the case until that happens to markets going to keep going higher."
"1511620","1513600"," So let's talk about it right now."
"1513760","1514840"," So we are on top. "
"1515020","1517540"," We have or we traded above the hourly trigger."
"1517760","1519720"," Okay, we tested it."
"1519920","1520540"," No problem. "
"1520920","1522420"," Coming back up right now."
"1522840","1523340"," Coming up."
"1523520","1525400"," So let me move this over a little bit. "
"1526220","1526940"," Right there."
"1528120","1531300"," So you're coming up into a little bit of resistance right here, right?"
"1531540","1534880"," All these bears thinking, yeah, we're going to pull back and bloodbath down here."
"1535420","1538260"," That kind of stuff like the like we usually do, bro. "
"1538600","1539760"," Look at all this is, right?"
"1540380","1543600"," But the bulls really do have no time here."
"1543780","1544880"," They got no time."
"1545080","1546640"," They got no time for pullbacks. "
"1547760","1553100"," They literally have to like blast up here and they got to sneak out."
"1555500","1556620"," Let me show you here."
"1557080","1557660"," Right there. "
"1558000","1559260"," There's your needle."
"1561440","1563380"," There is your needle right here."
"1563560","1572990"," If you're a bull, there it is right there and price needs to somehow find its way"
"1572990","1576710"," right through there and escape. "
"1579270","1586110"," If they don't do that, and I'm talking like today, Monday, if they don't see the human needle, it's"
"1586110","1586690"," so fucked up."
"1587010","1590550"," If they don't do that, there is a world of hurt coming for bulls."
"1591210","1592770"," So we're going to look at the trigger screen really quick. "
"1593650","1594410"," We're going to go."
"1594850","1596070"," I'm going to show you guys something here."
"1596850","1598430"," We'll open that up. "
"1598550","1601010"," Do that right there."
"1601730","1605830"," So if you are a bull, we're going to switch to a daily chart here."
"1607050","1609030"," And I'm going to warn you here again. "
"1609130","1615090"," Same warning we gave about where we were down here and what matters here."
"1615210","1616530"," You get to see this here, okay?"
"1617510","1619270"," Let me get this very simple for you."
"1619270","1621270"," No rocket science here. "
"1621630","1622730"," We're just very simple."
"1623470","1627310"," As simple as it can be, bulls have no time left."
"1627590","1629850"," They must come up here. "
"1630630","1638550"," Even if they reject on 434, 31, even if they reject, they have to get there."
"1639510","1649250"," Let's say they reject and then they need the support of the weekly trigger to escape, right?"
"1649250","1650750"," We talk about all the time, right?"
"1651610","1653990"," That's the consolidation distribution trap."
"1654450","1656030"," They need to break above that, don't they?"
"1656690","1660210"," So they can have some continuation to the upside, right?"
"1660390","1663110"," So what does the daily chart for S&P 500?"
"1663850","1672470"," Now, if the bulls fail to do this super, super fast, if they fail to do this here, if they"
"1672470","1677210"," fail to get above the weekly trigger right here, if they fail this, look at this, between now and"
"1677210","1678570"," Monday, they cannot fail this. "
"1679170","1680690"," They have to get above that weekly trigger."
"1681030","1689630"," If they fail to do that, you are going to see this daily trigger come down and rain all kinds"
"1689630","1691270"," of hell on bulls, okay?"
"1691830","1696510"," Drew this out and put it on the website earlier in the week, right?"
"1696750","1703870"," I made a post on the website I believe last Friday or Monday or something and I posted the first"
"1703870","1708730"," picture that I posted was something similar to this right here."
"1709970","1713050"," And what you don't want to see is the failure. "
"1713610","1722450"," So listen closely, sellers and bulls, buyers and and bulls, they want to see this rejection right"
"1722450","1723750"," here in that weekly trigger."
"1723930","1725550"," They want to see a major rejection."
"1726190","1733550"," They don't want you getting back into any zone of consolidation and they want to blast you straight"
"1733550","1736070"," down to 403 64, okay?"
"1736790","1741810"," So this is what a bear is looking for, make you feel good about yourself as a bull and then"
"1741810","1743370"," bam drop you right down. "
"1743570","1745370"," So what does a bull need here, right?"
"1745810","1751290"," The bull, it's not good enough that you trade the weekly trigger."
"1752050","1761170"," You need the eye of the needle, you need price to break above the weekly trigger, sneak up in here,"
"1761910","1762130"," right?"
"1762390","1766690"," Even if you have a little bit of consolidation and then doing a skate move up and to the right,"
"1767230","1767730"," you know what I'm saying?"
"1768370","1778070"," So I would be paying extremely close attention to price at the weekly trigger, extreme"
"1778070","1779890"," close attention."
"1780530","1782450"," You can see us continuing to squeeze. "
"1783050","1786870"," There's probably people in this chat right now that have no fucking idea what's happening."
"1787290","1790670"," They think they're just going to short this shit that they're going to get smoked right now."
"1791590","1794890"," They're going to get absolutely fucking smoke here. "
"1795630","1798330"," So what you're looking for here is two numbers."
"1798870","1800150"," I gave them earlier in the week."
"1800870","1807290"," I gave them yesterday on Twitter and I want you to pay attention today to that orange line right"
"1807290","1807510"," there. "
"1807650","1817570"," That's that 429.45 and the next one is 434.31. You need to pay extremely close attention to"
"1817570","1818070"," those numbers."
"1818570","1826890"," These numbers are going to tell you if you are out of the woods or if the threat of a"
"1826890","1828710"," crash still looms."
"1829730","1830870"," You know what else to do about this?"
"1831690","1834290"," You know what this price action reminds me of?"
"1835570","1839230"," That December price action. "
"1839650","1847550"," This looks exactly like the December price action where we were extremely bearish and looking for a"
"1847550","1848530"," roll to the downside."
"1849310","1854750"," It was like a Thursday or something and these sellers came in and said we're going to blast down"
"1854750","1858710"," and it just went straight up and caught them right in the trap."
"1859270","1859650"," Right?"
"1860670","1866850"," So looking at this price action right here in Spy, I would not be trying to short this shit if"
"1866850","1867410"," I was a bear. "
"1868010","1869830"," You can but not yet."
"1870250","1872650"," If you're already short, I guess you could stay short."
"1872850","1878670"," But the truth here is let's look at this right here is if you're a seller, you are looking for"
"1878670","1884750"," that kind of rejection and you definitely do not want to see this if you're a seller. "
"1885550","1885890"," Right?"
"1886450","1889170"," You definitely don't want to see that either."
"1889490","1889550"," Right?"
"1890450","1891150"," That's it."
"1891270","1892010"," You're done. "
"1892730","1893110"," Right?"
"1893270","1896450"," If you get above that 434, so sellers do not want to see that."
"1896930","1901590"," And if anything, if you're a seller and you're still bearish here, right?"
"1902550","1912270"," You need to be rejecting under 42370, rejecting under 42370."
"1913250","1915210"," So you need to get under here. "
"1918510","1919190"," Right?"
"1919370","1920950"," You need to get underneath here."
"1921670","1922070"," Right?"
"1922310","1924270"," To get some confirmation to go short."
"1924610","1928470"," If you aren't under here, you're going to be waiting. "
"1930030","1931390"," You're going to be waiting."
"1931670","1934530"," So let's say price goes up and it rejects here."
"1934710","1936230"," You can take that if you want. "
"1936970","1942230"," I'm down with that trade and I'm down with the trade down here if you get underneath the hourly."
"1943010","1947290"," So if you get underneath here, all right, and you want to sell that down there."
"1947350","1948490"," I'm down with that trade too. "
"1949110","1950990"," But right now you ain't got no trade."
"1951230","1955690"," And if there's anybody out there telling that you do that you have a trade here, I think you're out"
"1955690","1957930"," of your fucking mind and it's super dangerous."
"1958630","1960870"," If you're a seller, I think it's super dangerous here. "
"1960970","1962830"," I know this is a normal, a natural setup."
"1963590","1963850"," Right?"
"1964010","1967390"," We usually squeeze up here and then roll straight down to the depths of hell."
"1967950","1968310"," Right?"
"1968570","1970090"," Test that low and then go higher. "
"1970670","1971990"," But I'm telling you, be careful."
"1972170","1973370"," If you're a seller, be careful here."
"1974090","1974670"," Just today. "
"1975910","1977870"," Now, saying all of this, right?"
"1978110","1978610"," Blah, blah, blah."
"1978750","1980070"," I've gotten through all this crap here."
"1980950","1981610"," Uh, bulls. "
"1982530","1986170"," If you're a bull, you cannot, you cannot."
"1986170","1989490"," Cannot go into the weekend."
"1990490","1998970"," So the close of today, you cannot go into the close today with price right here and not be hedged"
"1998970","2001190"," into Monday if you own this market. "
"2001570","2003270"," Listen to what I just said to you."
"2003350","2003490"," Okay."
"2003610","2005030"," Well, we'll talk about it one more time. "
"2005970","2013230"," If you own this market and the market closes today right here, you must buy put protection if you"
"2013230","2013830"," own the market."
"2014170","2019470"," I don't care if they're three cent or five cent puts into Monday or next Friday or something, but"
"2019470","2021070"," you cannot we cannot close here."
"2021070","2026510"," If you are a bull and we go up here, okay, end of the close today. "
"2027350","2030190"," You still need to hedge this right here."
"2031030","2041030"," Okay, so if we trade even this 434 and change 434 31, you cannot not hedge yourself if you own"
"2041030","2041570"," this market."
"2042070","2049250"," You are not in the clear if you are a bull until something similar to this happens. "
"2049650","2050290"," Okay, similar."
"2051010","2052489"," You got to break above the weakling."
"2052989","2060949"," You got to break above the daily and then you got to retest the daily and go it's begin to"
"2060949","2069370"," go higher in preferably with the hourly trigger supporting you as you do it and velocity on your"
"2069370","2069909"," side. "
"2070570","2076310"," So if you were to come up here, you get the hourly trigger coming up and then price blast down"
"2076310","2083290"," gets your nice velocity on the on the daily on the daily or daily or daily, hourly velocity, right?"
"2083630","2089730"," Then you start having that hourly trigger helping you on the daily and the weekly until you get all"
"2089730","2090590"," that stuff right there."
"2090590","2091489"," You are not out of the woods."
"2091690","2094030"," So that's my one caveat to you. "
"2094190","2100890"," If you are a bull is there is a is that there is a trap here for you into Monday"
"2100890","2104890"," as long as price is below 434 31."
"2105650","2108670"," So be nimble if you are a bull."
"2108990","2110410"," Be extremely nimble. "
"2110990","2112750"," Do not trust these fucking bears."
"2112850","2114150"," Do not trust Jamie Diamond."
"2114590","2117570"," Do not trust whoever wants this market lower. "
"2117910","2120250"," Whoever wants the cheapest price on spoos."
"2120610","2122270"," Whoever wants to crash the markets."
"2123570","2128410"," I'm telling you, if you're a bull, you are not out of the woods yet until you're above that 434"
"2128410","2131810"," not out of the woods and a retest of that 434. "
"2132350","2134930"," So even though a bull might be like, hey, I'm super bullish."
"2135250","2136210"," There's great numbers today."
"2136670","2137730"," Everything's going to be awesome. "
"2138310","2138410"," Right."
"2138510","2139810"," And that really matters today."
"2141290","2143570"," Really matters what those numbers are. "
"2144470","2146190"," It might not matter next week."
"2146510","2148350"," What really matters is price action."
"2148790","2150730"," Price action is what fucking matters. "
"2151710","2153690"," That is what matters in reality."
"2154190","2154930"," Let's get back to reality."
"2155430","2155450"," Right. "
"2155590","2157090"," What really matters is price action."
"2157310","2160850"," So let's say you're like, hey, well, no, that's great news."
"2161010","2161710"," We're going to be bullish. "
"2161830","2163150"," We're going to rip up all next week."
"2163170","2164550"," It's going to be fall or it's going to be amazing."
"2165030","2165910"," No more risk here. "
"2166230","2166510"," A bull."
"2166670","2167270"," I'm super bullish."
"2168350","2169190"," That's not the case. "
"2169210","2172850"," The case is regardless of what news was out today."
"2173930","2175510"," That price action will be king."
"2176070","2180210"," What else is will matter is where price is. "
"2180630","2185810"," So until price is above that 434 and change, you do not have an out here."
"2186110","2187490"," You do not have any kind of safety."
"2188210","2189430"," You've got no pieces. "
"2189850","2191150"," If you're a bull, you ain't got shit."
"2191910","2195330"," You have to you have to see that price action happen."
"2196350","2198830"," So I'm going to so that you got that warning from me now. "
"2199050","2201110"," We close today below that weekly trigger."
"2201270","2202950"," We close today below that daily trigger."
"2203630","2206310"," You can't you are not safe if you are a bull. "
"2206570","2209810"," You are not out of the woods and they can slam this shit on you on Monday."
"2211070","2212150"," So be aware of that."
"2212250","2212350"," Okay. "
"2212490","2213590"," If you're a bull out there."
"2217950","2219130"," What a bull wants baby."
"2219410","2219870"," What a bear needs. "
"2220130","2221170"," These fucking bears, man."
"2221330","2221950"," They don't have much time."
"2221950","2222310"," Do they?"
"2223110","2227130"," They've been holding this and holding this and holding this and holding this and them holding this. "
"2227230","2228790"," They got dimming out there."
"2228970","2229890"," Marco out there."
"2229970","2231430"," They got all kinds of guys. "
"2231570","2232930"," I don't even know bears, Peter Schiff."
"2233110","2233490"," You name it."
"2234070","2235570"," They all want their blood, right?"
"2235930","2237590"," They all want their blood and they didn't get it. "
"2237690","2238570"," They're pissed off."
"2239010","2239970"," They got to be angry."
"2243130","2243490"," Yeah. "
"2243590","2245730"," I heard there was a speech coming from Biden today."
"2246230","2249010"," He's going to talk about robust employment."
"2249010","2251450"," He's going to say what I want to say here. "
"2252970","2255010"," Talk about robust employment today."
"2256690","2257590"," Should I put it up?"
"2257750","2258770"," Should we listen to it?"
"2259370","2262830"," We can put it out if you want, but I know it's got to be it's got to be garbage."
"2266170","2267590"," It's going to be a disaster. "
"2269590","2279140"," Yeah, so we're going to we're so what today is going to be focused on is a"
"2279140","2280060"," training session."
"2280120","2283940"," So we're going to do a training session today."
"2285200","2286940"," We're going to roll into that segment. "
"2286940","2292160"," We're going to go through and do a live stream."
"2292240","2296460"," Well, that's a live stream right now, but that's going to turn into a video that we're going to cut"
"2296460","2300560"," up and turn into a video series on what everything means."
"2300820","2301340"," That is today. "
"2301500","2302180"," We're doing that today."
"2303720","2305500"," Unless you guys want to do that Sunday, it's up to you."
"2305540","2306240"," It doesn't matter to me. "
"2307640","2310720"," We can trade the market today or we can do it on Sunday or Saturday."
"2311080","2311560"," It's your choice."
"2312660","2315660"," But that is the plan for today is that we're going to make that video. "
"2316880","2322040"," Remember, people are telling you that we're going to get a role because we're up here at this, you"
"2322040","2323360"," know, this volatility up here."
"2323980","2325620"," So let's see if that happens, right?"
"2325900","2330680"," These guys are all saying we're going to crash this because we're these guys are telling you, oh,"
"2330780","2332520"," yeah, we get a role every time we go up there, right?"
"2332660","2333180"," We're going to the downside."
"2334680","2337200"," I want to see that happen today because I don't think it happens. "
"2337200","2339220"," I think we squeeze fucking faces off."
"2339680","2340820"," It's going to be nice."
"2340840","2342000"," You're going to watch this. "
"2342220","2343020"," People are going to get squeezed."
"2344660","2346000"," The vol is going to roll over."
"2346320","2348660"," Oh, god, damn limb scapers here. "
"2349960","2352240"," Hopefully you guys can't hear my lawn guy outside."
"2356370","2359830"," Squeezing higher now, trying to trade R1 at 426-18."
"2360610","2362510"," There is your R1 right there. "
"2365000","2366760"," Explosive move to the upside here."
"2369390","2373290"," Trading 425-61, hopefully by a dip this morning."
"2374310","2380490"," I want you also to know that that weakness in the pre-markets, I was fascinated because we were"
"2380490","2381430"," weak in the pre-market. "
"2381750","2386450"," And I'm like, I'm like, I think people on Fintuit think that was a bloodbath."
"2387390","2390330"," It found that shit bounced right off the low from Tuesday."
"2390610","2392950"," And I was like, fuck, yeah, buyers still here. "
"2393650","2399030"," If you were a bear today, you wanted to see a new low in pre-market."
"2399330","2400370"," And that didn't happen."
"2400810","2407610"," Dealers going against you today as well, you couldn't be tricked into, you couldn't be tricked"
"2407610","2411490"," today into a market sentiment going to the opposite side. "
"2411610","2416810"," The market was unhedged at the start of the quarter, risk of crash."
"2417870","2420230"," Then everybody hedged the next like two or three days."
"2420910","2428010"," They loaded up on 400 and 410 P's, 4,400 P's on SPX. "
"2428590","2432290"," No follow through this morning on the extreme bearishness."
"2432770","2435730"," No waterfall fall put by in this morning."
"2435870","2436970"," What do dealers do to you?"
"2437730","2439170"," What do dealers do to you?"
"2439230","2441030"," And you don't get any of that fall through Marco. "
"2442290","2444350"," They run against you, don't they?"
"2444730","2446610"," And so we start squeezing higher."
"2446930","2451310"," Slap in the top of the key right now on R1."
"2452370","2453730"," Slap in the top of the key. "
"2454570","2455990"," Slap that ask, baby."
"2457050","2457550"," R1."
"2457930","2458590"," Let's have it. "
"2466930","2469390"," Got to piss him off out there."
"2470010","2471210"," It's like top of the key, Ma."
"2471670","2472950"," It's like playing basketball. "
"2474310","2475370"," This is like what?"
"2475670","2476910"," Backyard basketball, right?"
"2477670","2479190"," Fast break basketball."
"2479450","2480790"," Remember, fast break basketball."
"2481030","2483390"," If any of you guys played a high school in college basketball. "
"2487730","2488970"," Top of the key, Ma."
"2495040","2496240"," Well, there's R1."
"2500110","2502590"," There goes little R1 for you right there. "
"2503850","2505990"," Little R1 action for you."
"2507950","2509030"," So what are you going to do?"
"2509290","2511310"," Like if you're a bear, what are you going to do, man?"
"2511610","2512950"," Like you need unemployment."
"2513330","2514570"," If you're a bear, right?"
"2515250","2517890"," If you're a bear, you have to have unemployment. "
"2519050","2520630"," You can't not have it."
"2520790","2521430"," Is that what you think?"
"2521630","2523390"," You think you crashed the stock market with unemployment?"
"2524410","2525390"," Hold on a second here."
"2525850","2526590"," Hold on a second here. "
"2529330","2534290"," I'm going to roll up a dream on dooby right now."
"2534450","2534570"," Hold on."
"2534670","2535710"," Let me roll that bad boy up. "
"2537950","2539690"," We're going to light that thing up."
"2549630","2552870"," You need high unemployment."
"2553750","2554690"," I don't need it. "
"2555630","2556570"," You need it."
"2559100","2560480"," You need bad numbers."
"2568700","2572100"," We're you know we're closer to if you guys want to compare where we are. "
"2572500","2582300"," If you want to compare where we are closer to I think it was June 28th of 2010 or 2011."
"2582900","2586480"," If you want to look back on that those years, I think it was June 28th."
"2588620","2596320"," The reason being was we ended up getting some downgrades on a closure. "
"2598720","2604340"," I think the government shut down or something, but we matter of fact, it had already crashed before"
"2604340","2605460"," the government shut down."
"2606820","2610920"," But we got like a Moody's thing or something like that because of the shutdown."
"2611400","2613920"," But we didn't get the shutdown this time, did we?"
"2614740","2616460"," So we didn't get the shutdown this time. "
"2616520","2618290"," So that would be the closest I could think of."
"2618870","2622010"," 1987 was a completely different thing too, right?"
"2622190","2624590"," It was blamed on computing, right?"
"2624830","2627470"," It was blamed on computers."
"2627930","2629770"," It was the advent of switching over to computers. "
"2630110","2633610"," So can we really assign it to those to 2010-2010?"
"2634050","2634410"," Probably not."
"2634790","2636570"," Like where we are specifically in the marketplace?"
"2637270","2637650"," Probably not."
"2637850","2639670"," Can you say that it was in that 1987?"
"2640670","2641330"," Probably not. "
"2641430","2642250"," It's not the same time frame."
"2642830","2644350"," It's not the same situation either."
"2645350","2647870"," If I'm going to be honest with you, you're a bear, right?"
"2648770","2649790"," Please listen to me closely. "
"2650470","2654930"," Get on a trading view, get yourself an unemployment chart, like a new chart below SPX."
"2655790","2659670"," And just go back and check SPX against unemployment and you'll get your answer."
"2660450","2661770"," That's the one you're looking for. "
"2661890","2663230"," That's the guy that's on your side."
"2663630","2665670"," Unemployment numbers have to be on your side."
"2667090","2668690"," Employment numbers have to be. "
"2668750","2670070"," It's like that unemployment unemployment."
"2670590","2671490"," That's your jam, man."
"2673170","2676430"," Squeezing higher right now. "
"2677190","2679670"," What is that above right now?"
"2679950","2680570"," What's that number?"
"2682090","2684630"," Well, is that 429-45?"
"2686190","2687530"," 429-45?"
"2690410","2692350"," We got R2 up here."
"2693750","2695410"," And we got R3."
"2698580","2701920"," Here's the weekly trigger right here. "
"2702600","2705240"," That conversation I was having with you earlier."
"2705960","2707720"," See that bounce down there this morning?"
"2708280","2709420"," Bam, in pre-market."
"2710120","2716920"," If you were a collapsed bear, if you were a prolapsed bear, if you were a crash bear, you needed"
"2716920","2719100"," to be below that number down, that purple line. "
"2719620","2722220"," You needed like straight blood down here and you didn't get it."
"2723140","2725160"," That's what you wanted in pre-market."
"2725480","2731860"," Below that number down there, you did not want that bounce coming into the open. "
"2732680","2734040"," So where are we going now?"
"2735280","2736280"," Where are we going?"
"2737220","2739440"," Where are we going now?"
"2739620","2740120"," Explain to me."
"2740800","2743200"," I thought we were supposed to roll this shit over right here."
"2744100","2747040"," I was promised cake and ice cream this morning. "
"2747240","2747960"," That's not happening."
"2748500","2754200"," Weekly trigger, R3 to the upside, 430-41, R2."
"2755100","2758140"," Weekly trigger, 429-50. "
"2758960","2761600"," Stock market on a Friday."
"2762660","2772280"," Blasting off to new highs straighten 42672 running over any one"
"2772280","2774060"," short right now."
"2782680","2789960"," I bet there's someone in the chat right now that's like unemployment will never, unemployment's"
"2789960","2792790"," never coming down because there's too many people working four or five jobs. "
"2793110","2793970"," The numbers are skewed."
"2795950","2801030"," We got less workers out there today than we did back in the 1970s and 80s."
"2801210","2803950"," So you're never going to get the right unemployment numbers. "
"2807570","2809610"," It's a Ponzi scheme too."
"2811170","2812310"," Unemployment's Ponzi scheme."
"2818050","2819850"," What does the chart say over there?"
"2820030","2821610"," The thing says long, right?"
"2822490","2824070"," Is that what that thing says up there?"
"2824390","2825530"," Oh yeah, look at that up there. "
"2827210","2828010"," What is that?"
"2828290","2828970"," What is that?"
"2829770","2830950"," What does this box say up here?"
"2832270","2833870"," That box says long, right?"
"2834290","2837090"," Yeah, that box says that box says long as fuck, doesn't it?"
"2837710","2839250"," Oh yeah, fuck yeah, long."
"2840090","2841150"," Oh yeah."
"2845670","2846830"," Oh yeah, oh yeah. "
"2847130","2848730"," I was going to sing a different song but I can't."
"2849570","2850430"," I'm going to look at that."
"2850670","2852990"," Oh yeah, just up there, 429-45. "
"2853470","2853910"," Yeah, touch it."
"2854690","2856290"," Touch that 429-45."
"2864950","2866670"," So I'm fascinated. "
"2866890","2868470"," I want to see this price action today."
"2869070","2874990"," I want to see, do you get all pulled up into the clothes and then they just black Monday this"
"2874990","2875210"," shit?"
"2877130","2881310"," We've got an Indigenous people day coming up on Monday too, don't we?"
"2882110","2887910"," We got some, we know we'll talk about, we've got Indigenous people day coming up on Monday so some"
"2887910","2895050"," markets are closed and then we've got some major economic news coming out next week."
"2896290","2898910"," So we'll take a look at that economic calendar at some points. "
"2898910","2900890"," Maybe it's implications into next week."
"2901250","2906070"," If the bears are thinking, yeah, they're not out of the woods yet, right?"
"2906410","2907730"," Bull's not out of the woods yet."
"2907890","2915010"," We just got to keep them underneath that daily trigger and the bears have lots of economic news"
"2915010","2915810"," next week. "
"2916350","2922070"," So they have this like window next week and we're going to show you something else."
"2922250","2922850"," A lot of second here."
"2923990","2929830"," I'm going to show you, hold on here. "
"2931310","2932910"," See you got something else here."
"2939070","2940070"," Hold on here."
"2940430","2941350"," What am I looking for here?"
"2942150","2942810"," One quick second. "
"2948170","2955170"," I'm going to give a shout out right now to, I'm going to give a shout out to the whoever"
"2955170","2963670"," the boys are over at, whoever the boys are over at gamma labs."
"2966150","2967630"," So hold on one second here."
"2968550","2971130"," I'm going to show you something from them from this morning. "
"2973050","2974590"," Hold on here."
"2975190","2975730"," We got to do here."
"2980450","2982410"," I guess we could just put this up couldn't we?"
"2982690","2983070"," Hold on here. "
"2985170","2986610"," Let's see if we can just put this up."
"2988850","2989370"," All right."
"2990030","2998230"," So this is the SPX seasonality for the year, right?"
"3000940","3003490"," Blue line five year average. "
"3004190","3007030"," The green line is the current price."
"3011260","3017730"," We've got this we got this bounce right here and we got another low down here."
"3017750","3018250"," You see that?"
"3018970","3020450"," Yeah, one more low. "
"3022010","3024510"," So if you have any kind of failure, right?"
"3025090","3029050"," Squeeze higher over the weekend and one more drop next week possibly."
"3029610","3031870"," So just be aware of that into next week."
"3032970","3033410"," Okay. "
"3033550","3034590"," I want you to just be aware of it."
"3034590","3034790"," Okay."
"3035010","3037550"," So if today, let's say we squeeze up, right?"
"3038170","3038970"," Let's be closely here. "
"3039450","3041430"," So big chart right here, right?"
"3042150","3043470"," But I want you to look at it."
"3043490","3050810"," So if we squeeze up today and we reject the downside into next week on some volatility, utility"
"3050810","3057870"," assigned to assigned to economic news that we have coming out next week, right?"
"3058470","3059510"," Don't be surprised."
"3060390","3061790"," So pay attention to this chart. "
"3062070","3063130"," You know, it's not exact, right?"
"3063270","3063650"," It never is."
"3064370","3066030"," And I'm going to give you guys a key."
"3066570","3069130"," I want to give you guys a key point about this chart too. "
"3069210","3069390"," Okay."
"3070670","3076530"," Even though it follows some kind of trend, right?"
"3076790","3080510"," Some kind of trend, you know, pay attention to like this right here, right?"
"3082150","3088210"," So if seasonally we should have been stronger, longer, right?"
"3088830","3091930"," Should have been stronger, right?"
"3092190","3095190"," Seasonally this says we're going up, but in fact, we went down, right?"
"3096150","3097570"," During this time period."
"3097570","3103830"," So you can't really like can't really say, yeah, we're going to go down to this lower low and not"
"3103830","3104150"," crash. "
"3104390","3105510"," Can't say that, can you?"
"3105810","3107650"," As you can see that it happened right here, right?"
"3108510","3111330"," So grain of salt on this stuff."
"3112050","3120390"," But even so grain of salt in this stuff, but even so, if you want to look at it or"
"3120390","3129930"," use it as a third or fourth right here, right?"
"3130070","3135790"," So that beautiful ripper, then expect one more low, but but it's still up and to the right, right?"
"3136530","3138070"," Still up and to the right."
"3139030","3140930"," So we know what to look for. "
"3141030","3147550"," We know we know what the pitfalls are."
"3148190","3152150"," We know that we're squeezing up right now."
"3152710","3160930"," We know where the weekly trigger is, right?"
"3161430","3163830"," We know where r2 is, right?"
"3164390","3169650"," Coming into r2 at 427.88, right there. "
"3176340","3177340"," There's our two."
"3184140","3189020"," Squeeze and I are right now trying to trade r2, 427.88 looking for."
"3189660","3191140"," I'm going to take that down one. "
"3192440","3193980"," Slap that ask up there."
"3195560","3200580"," Just monster squeezing right now, not the news that a bull or that a bear wanted to hear."
"3200980","3210420"," Not only that, the positioning of the market, the positioning of the market was the positioning of"
"3210420","3212020"," the market was challenging. "
"3213460","3214140"," Jerome Powell."
"3214780","3222620"," If you have market participants, major players saying, fuck you, Jerome, we don't think you're"
"3222620","3231340"," going to be raising into December 2024 and the numbers for at least today is Jerome Powell giving a"
"3231340","3234340"," big fuck you to whoever's challenging me, right?"
"3235380","3237180"," We are going higher for longer."
"3237500","3239020"," I am going to lie on these numbers. "
"3241120","3246700"," That's just a joke, but I want to entertain the people that think that."
"3250400","3252020"," Not what they want to hear."
"3253400","3255800"," Not what a bull bear wants to hear today. "
"3262810","3264090"," It's going to moon, baby."
"3265050","3266670"," Give me all your short money."
"3267530","3268970"," Thread the needle for me. "
"3270630","3274030"," Thread that needle S&P 500."
"3274810","3276350"," Thread that needle for daddy."
"3283950","3285010"," It's so bizarre. "
"3285310","3291030"," I'm looking at these numbers this morning and I'm like, I'm like, you got Jerome saying, you got"
"3291030","3292850"," Jerome saying higher for longer."
"3293170","3295650"," You got banks going, we don't believe you."
"3296130","3300450"," And you got Jerome coming out this morning and being like, maybe it is higher for longer, right?"
"3301230","3302450"," And of course, what do they have to do?"
"3302590","3304090"," Take the hedge off, right?"
"3306230","3310530"," They're losing to the, don't fight the Fed works for today. "
"3310870","3313790"," This Friday, today, don't fight the Fed works."
"3316850","3321030"," Hold on a second."
"3322770","3325130"," Let's look at, I got to look at something here. "
"3325990","3334230"," Oh, what's my boy, GME doing this morning?"
"3335030","3336270"," What's up, GME?"
"3336730","3337970"," What's up, GME boys?"
"3338910","3341630"," Is it GME gang in here right now or what?"
"3342850","3344330"," Hey, GME is out there."
"3346370","3347790"," Oh shit."
"3364430","3366410"," What's that GME doing today?"
"3366410","3371390"," Is GME OK today?"
"3377270","3380010"," Sloping the ask on our two just now. "
"3380430","3381970"," Time is right now."
"3383070","3384630"," 1146 in the morning."
"3397440","3398740"," Oh yeah. "
"3422770","3425330"," Oh yeah, look at the spoons hanging dong."
"3438950","3440250"," Oh, let's see here."
"3453810","3456110"," Look at spoons hanging dong right now. "
"3456130","3457950"," Let's do a close up of spoons hanging down."
"3457990","3459350"," I'm not going to play any bull music here."
"3460010","3462570"," I've been playing bear music, so I'm not going to play any bulls. "
"3462890","3464470"," They don't get their rate of terror."
"3466310","3467890"," Bull's out of the woods yet."
"3468050","3468550"," What do we got going?"
"3468710","3469430"," Oh my God. "
"3469590","3470010"," Look at that."
"3470410","3472270"," Whoa, 427 84."
"3474110","3475350"," 427 84. "
"3476290","3477190"," What are the rules?"
"3477510","3478110"," Do you know the rules?"
"3480050","3481690"," What are the rules here?"
"3483390","3486070"," Look at that."
"3486070","3488990"," Oh, man, dude."
"3492150","3496350"," Gee, daddy gold chime in and let us know that it's a green week right now. "
"3513870","3516190"," Look at that slapping ask up there."
"3516450","3517270"," 427 88."
"3522960","3523860"," Hold on here. "
"3524040","3524560"," Look at that."
"3524680","3525820"," Just hanging dong down there."
"3525900","3526400"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"3526460","3529240"," I got to can't make it so embarrassing right now."
"3529280","3534280"," We'll spread that out so the bears don't we don't want to get the bears mad today."
"3535720","3537220"," All right, we don't want to get them too mad. "
"3537960","3538660"," There's that weekly."
"3538920","3540360"," Let me try to get that weekly trigger right."
"3546900","3548640"," All right, so you guys know where that is. "
"3548740","3549480"," You're good on that one."
"3551260","3552180"," Oh, yeah."
"3552500","3553260"," Oh, yeah. "
"3553700","3556160"," Oh, yeah."
"3557020","3558980"," Oh, yeah."
"3559800","3560460"," Oh, yeah. "
"3560460","3560900"," Oh, yeah."
"3561740","3562540"," Oh, yeah."
"3562540","3570350"," Oh, yeah. "
"3574490","3575130"," Sorry."
"3575210","3580170"," Well, looking for a retest of the one minute trigger at 426 54."
"3581670","3583910"," Trade up into that weekly trigger. "
"3585550","3595090"," It's been too long."
"3597030","3598370"," Let's say current positioning."
"3598630","3601690"," I've got calls on for today. "
"3602770","3609030"," And I've got 300 call spreads from Tuesday."
"3609850","3614230"," I bought them at the end of the day, like one 30, I think in the afternoon, two 30 in"
"3614230","3615170"," the afternoon somewhere in there."
"3615610","3616630"," Well, some sitting on those. "
"3618010","3624830"," And if we don't, depending upon where we close today, I'm still long too right now and zero dates"
"3624830","3625230"," for today."
"3625890","3635410"," If depending on where we close today or where we tag, once we tag this this weekly trigger, I'm"
"3635410","3645270"," thinking I'm out, but where we close the day will force me either to buy a bunch of zero date"
"3645270","3648570"," puts for Monday, like crash puts, maybe Wednesday."
"3651190","3656510"," I'm going to have to throw some money away, like insurance on my position, not a ton of money, but"
"3656510","3662210"," a bunch of like three cent, five cent puts for maybe Monday or Wednesday. "
"3662390","3669530"," We'll look at that when we, so when we get up to this weekly trigger up here, or briefly, when"
"3669530","3672250"," we get up, when we get close to this, pay attention to this, okay."
"3673130","3674950"," So you got 430 41."
"3681010","3682270"," Right there, okay. "
"3683230","3689560"," Now, here's your R3."
"3692660","3702310"," I would be, I would be wrapping things up if I was a bull somewhere right here."
"3703330","3703590"," Okay. "
"3705070","3708390"," Now, I might even go a little bit lower."
"3713970","3715830"," Now that this is me, okay."
"3716710","3717690"," This is me. "
"3717990","3727770"," Now, I know that you probably don't believe that and you probably trying to trade 430 ish."
"3728190","3732910"," So this R3 is probably where you're going to take this."
"3733610","3739270"," I don't like to keep that much risk on, but right there. "
"3739470","3744890"," And so the question would be, so let me see if I can draw that up there."
"3745090","3746090"," I'd go a little bit early."
"3747070","3751250"," I'd go a little bit early on this one too, but that's 430, right?"
"3753050","3759050"," You also have 425 is down here. "
"3760510","3763630"," So could we have a pullback over here?"
"3763930","3763970"," Sure."
"3763970","3765330"," Can we like pullback to 425?"
"3765990","3766110"," Sure."
"3766890","3771010"," We can, like we pull back all the way over here and then go up there?"
"3771230","3771390"," Yes. "
"3773070","3778910"," But as long as this, as this one minute trigger holds, the bias is to the upside to trade these"
"3778910","3782330"," two targets at least up here."
"3782630","3783570"," So I'm still bullish here."
"3786090","3788070"," Still bullish, still long, still bullish. "
"3789210","3791170"," And this weekly trigger is the target for me."
"3791890","3794770"," And if you're a bull, you need to be above this."
"3795090","3797390"," If you're a bull, this isn't good enough. "
"3797550","3799210"," Like you need to be above."
"3800470","3803890"," And then you need the hourly trigger to come up and help you out."
"3804490","3805790"," HT right here. "
"3808670","3814310"," If you don't do that, what happens is they smash up here."
"3814950","3817510"," You're going to reject all the way down to the hourly trigger."
"3819750","3823650"," So it's important for that hourly trigger to come up and help you out if you're a bull. "
"3824710","3829510"," You want that, you want that progressive, this green one moving up and helping you out."
"3832130","3834010"," So I'm looking for a rejection up here."
"3834150","3840610"," I'll go flat and you're going to be looking for, you're going to be looking for, so this has to"
"3840610","3841130"," hold right here. "
"3841330","3845870"," You're going to be looking for, so right now, this is your buy."
"3847850","3853610"," Put that down there for now if you want some help."
"3854350","3854850"," There you go. "
"3859450","3860630"," Some are just like that."
"3865800","3867580"," But I'm going to be concerned about the clothes."
"3868220","3876120"," So in all my, like, in all my joy and happiness right now, I still care about price. "
"3876740","3879360"," Like, I don't care how awesome this looks."
"3880160","3882020"," I don't care how bullish this looks."
"3882820","3886860"," The only thing that I care about is do we close above 434?"
"3887580","3888700"," That's my big question. "
"3889660","3891580"," And there ain't no time left to do it."
"3891940","3893600"," It ain't the weekly trigger either."
"3894020","3896940"," It's like 42945, not good enough for me. "
"3897520","3899540"," I need above 434."
"3900160","3905940"," I need another 6070 handles for me to believe in the bulls here."
"3906180","3909700"," So we'll pay attention to this as we go up there. "
"3910320","3914360"," And we will see if the bulls can get above that number."
"3914580","3917220"," I warn you, again, you have to keep saying this."
"3917900","3921800"," Any closing below that weekly trigger, any closing below that daily trigger, weekly and daily"
"3921800","3922980"," trigger, any closing below that. "
"3923540","3925200"," And bulls are not out of the woods."
"3925740","3930400"," You are set up for a major move to the downside off of those triggers."
"3931480","3935400"," Okay, so as we go up there to that weekly trigger, as we go up there to that daily trigger,"
"3935800","3941820"," if that shit begins to reject at any point, look the fuck out to the downside. "
"3942120","3942600"," Okay."
"3943580","3948000"," So bulls got a lot of work to do, a lot of work to do, a lot of work ahead"
"3948000","3948300"," of them."
"3948920","3954280"," And I would not trust price below those numbers into Monday. "
"3966110","3968570"," Yeah, we got a bunch of stuff coming out Chase next week."
"3969110","3971690"," Next week's economic calendar is out of control."
"3971870","3972610"," It's pretty wild. "
"3973730","3975790"," We got a pretty busy week next week."
"3977990","3979310"," I think that's your chance."
"3979630","3983390"," Like, so Chase, I didn't see Chase was here until just now. "
"3983490","3993310"," So Chase, if you're here, right, and you're a seller, you're like window of opportunity is going to"
"3993310","3998030"," be selling the weekly and daily trigger on that volatility next week."
"3999110","4006190"," So if you get that, if you're able to keep price below or reject below those numbers, you'll put a"
"4006190","4008610"," short on the market for that volatility next week."
"4008790","4016050"," I don't know where, I don't know if you're going to grab more than that 403 or that 416 to"
"4016050","4019990"," the downside, but that's your next window that you're looking for. "
"4020770","4023090"," Now, Chase, I will say something to you, man."
"4023870","4029730"," If we trade above that 434, do not short it unless we break below it."
"4030550","4036350"," If it begins to consolidate, it's just waiting for the hourly trigger to come up or some shit,"
"4036990","4037970"," don't short that shit. "
"4038110","4039530"," Make sure it's like a failure there."
"4039870","4046750"," If we trade underneath it and we reject that number, then we break below that hourly trigger so you"
"4046750","4050350"," can get the trend on your side, that downside trend for next week."
"4052870","4056170"," Squeezing higher again right now, trying to get up there to that weekly trigger. "
"4061730","4063990"," Sorry, I got to keep an eye out here."
"4065150","4067010"," We're coming into my warning zone."
"4067330","4074410"," So if you've got an area that you have of concern, if you're a bull, here's up here on this"
"4074410","4075070"," weekly trigger. "
"4077620","4087740"," So this weekly trigger right here on the bottom down here is 429.45. If"
"4087740","4094160"," you're looking to take some off up here, if you're looking to take some off, I can't blame you."
"4096460","4103000"," If you're trading zero dates, if you want to take that stuff off before, it can get really crispy,"
"4103899","4104120"," crazy."
"4104340","4110399"," You can get a first rejection and a straight bloodbath, like straight bloodbath here. "
"4111380","4117760"," We can squeeze up and over like it's nobody's business, but just know that my point here is that"
"4117760","4120700"," you're coming into a lot of volatility, right?"
"4120979","4125840"," You can squeeze up right now, come back down, double top it, then roll the downside over here."
"4126359","4133779"," So just as we come up here, if you're a bull, congratulations, you're coming up into this orange"
"4133779","4134800"," tag up here."
"4136140","4138979"," You're going to be taking some off the table as we get up there. "
"4140740","4142960"," I said I wasn't going to play any bull music, didn't I?"
"4143420","4147840"," I said I wasn't going to play any bull music."
"4150140","4150640"," I thought"
"4152470","4166450"," I'd"
"4166450","4166450"," leave it that shit."
"4175790","4183220"," Look there and tag it baby for me. "
"4192149","4193790"," Slap that ass."
"4197810","4208260"," Take the"
"4208260","4211040"," pain, trade please."
"4213340","4219060"," Squeeze them all out, spooze, trading $4.28.90 right now. "
"4219200","4220020"," This is the place."
"4229110","4231530"," Orange yellowish box right here."
"4232390","4234250"," What did I tell you I was doing here?"
"4235650","4240190"," Let me know in the chat if you've got balls, if you're going deep log. "
"4254060","4256120"," Yeah, I've got a salary right now."
"4256240","4257460"," I'm trying to take some off right now."
"4271690","4272850"," I'm glad right now. "
"4282440","4287600"," I still have call spreads on, but not zero dates, so no more zero dates on."
"4287800","4288520"," That's enough for me."
"4293960","4298580"," Spooze hanging down right now, trying to run on up and trade the weekly trigger. "
"4299620","4301980"," Some of you might have runners on right now."
"4302000","4304800"," I can't blame you if you do because I'm going to tell you why."
"4306260","4307700"," We got to thread the needle. "
"4308380","4310940"," We ain't got a lot of needle left to thread."
"4311540","4314580"," You need to get above the weekly trigger."
"4315080","4317580"," Get above the daily trigger. "
"4318080","4320400"," So let's see if the bulls can do that."
"4320620","4325320"," Can they smash to the upside and take out our three?"
"4326240","4327900"," Can they get above our three?"
"4328480","4330020"," Can they hold the weekly trigger?"
"4331340","4336160"," They don't have a choice but to get above the weekly trigger."
"4336160","4340780"," They don't have a choice but to trade above the daily trigger. "
"4341420","4342880"," No choice here for bulls."
"4343700","4344760"," Thread the needle."
"4345420","4352440"," Escape the coming doom of the daily trigger, crossing down through the weekly trigger. "
"4357890","4359510"," All right, I'll turn that shit off."
"4361590","4363770"," All right, I got that out of my system."
"4365250","4366330"," Oh yeah. "
"4369130","4372430"," Oh yeah, hold on a second here."
"4373790","4375590"," Let's see what you guys are saying out there."
"4381940","4383980"," Let's tune in right now. "
"4384400","4390560"," Sometimes my streamlabs doesn't do it quite like the live chat."
"4391240","4391960"," Oh, by the way."
"4393760","4397200"," Dude, you want to hear some crazy shit?"
"4398060","4399000"," I had a doctor's appointment. "
"4399180","4401720"," My wife got me a doctor's appointment."
"4403880","4405420"," I don't have any prescriptions."
"4406040","4407060"," I don't take any medicine. "
"4408580","4409360"," None of that stuff."
"4411340","4415020"," She was like, what about seasonal mood disorder for this winter?"
"4416920","4419200"," And so I went to the doctor yesterday."
"4419620","4420960"," I told you guys about it, right?"
"4421160","4422340"," So I went to the doctor yesterday. "
"4423760","4425880"," Squeezing up right now, trading the weekly trigger."
"4427060","4431220"," We are we're buckle up here, boys and girls."
"4434120","4434920"," So I want you. "
"4435100","4436700"," So, all right, so let's go back."
"4436820","4438960"," No, let's go back to the doctor."
"4439040","4440340"," So go to the doctor yesterday, right?"
"4442660","4448960"," And I got a very close friend who's a doctor. "
"4450000","4451960"," His name is Chris Reyes."
"4452420","4455780"," Chris Reyes, you're out there right now listening in this program."
"4455820","4457600"," Sometimes he listens and he might not be. "
"4457920","4462100"," Chris, if you're out there, I did what you told me to do."
"4463080","4470320"," So I had a primary care physician who was really old and kind of cranky."
"4471580","4473480"," And so, oh, look at that. "
"4473560","4474720"," Look at that reversal right there."
"4475580","4480540"," So, he wouldn't do the things that I asked him to do."
"4481380","4487340"," So two years ago, I think, or a year ago, I asked him for a colonoscopy. "
"4488720","4490740"," And I was told, no, I'm too young."
"4493120","4495080"," I'm too young to get a colonoscopy."
"4495080","4496600"," So if you're a man out there, listen closely. "
"4496900","4498920"," If you don't have a father, listen closely."
"4500380","4501300"," You know what dad, okay?"
"4501480","4504840"," If you don't have a dad and you're a younger guy, listen to me, okay?"
"4504940","4505140"," It's important."
"4505260","4507020"," It's important man to man conversation. "
"4511060","4514140"," So, this friend of mine is like, you have to get a colonoscopy."
"4514280","4515380"," And I'm like, well, okay."
"4515620","4516600"," So I asked, I got denied. "
"4517680","4522500"," And he's like, look, he's like, they don't allow you as a man to get a colonoscopy until you're 50."
"4523740","4525980"," He's like, but all men should get one at like 40."
"4527560","4531640"," And what happens is you wait until you're 50 and it's too late for you. "
"4532140","4533880"," Okay, you'll have cancers and shit."
"4535340","4540540"," And they'll try to manage that cancer for you for the next 10, 15, 20 years, how much longer you"
"4540540","4540940"," make it."
"4541640","4549320"," If you do it earlier, not frequently, like every week, but if you do it earlier, like 40, 45, and"
"4549320","4552800"," then 50, of course, which is when you normally get them, you can at least have an opportunity,"
"4552820","4557180"," maybe identifying issues you might have, right?"
"4558240","4559520"," So I was denied. "
"4560520","4563740"," So I went in to my doctor, yes, and I got a new doctor."
"4564360","4568080"," And I tried again what he told me to say to my doctors at my point."
"4568840","4574120"," And I said to them what I said to my, I said to them yesterday what my friend recommended for"
"4574120","4574560"," me to say. "
"4575460","4582940"," And so I said that stuff and sure than shit, I didn't ever expect it to be granted my my"
"4582940","4585920"," gift of an early colonoscopy."
"4586160","4587360"," But I was granted it."
"4587520","4587980"," I got a referral. "
"4588320","4589960"," I didn't get the colonoscopy yesterday."
"4590540","4593340"," But I was granted one by my doctor yesterday."
"4594260","4598500"," And I'm excited because I'm getting one earlier than I'm supposed to. "
"4599420","4604860"," But they did stick their either stuck a finger up my ass yesterday or they stuck a probe up my"
"4604860","4605260"," ass."
"4605740","4606840"," They made me lean over."
"4607520","4612280"," And they made me lean over on the side of a bed. "
"4613380","4615280"," And they like stuck something up my butthole."
"4615600","4616360"," It was terrible."
"4617020","4618620"," It was like the worst experience of my life. "
"4619140","4623240"," I've had doctors stick their finger up my butt and told me to cough when I was younger."
"4624220","4625500"," But I've never had an anal probe."
"4626780","4629800"," I got one yesterday and it was a nightmare. "
"4630760","4633660"," I think I didn't know if they were checking to see if they were serious."
"4635060","4639840"," It was like before we given the recommendation, let's take a probe up his ass and find out if he'll"
"4639840","4640300"," take that."
"4641240","4642020"," So I did. "
"4642220","4644060"," And it was the worst experience of my life."
"4644320","4646660"," I was like, what the fuck is going on here?"
"4650240","4652000"," That's the price I got to pay."
"4652780","4655280"," So I did get the recommendation though. "
"4655540","4659220"," I do have a colonoscopy planned or scheduled or it's being scheduled."
"4659520","4661380"," I've got someone scheduling it for me today."
"4663700","4666380"," But I guess I've got a colonoscopy coming my way. "
"4666400","4667180"," I've never had one."
"4667320","4671260"," So if you're an older guy and you've had a colonoscopy, let me know in the chat what your"
"4671260","4675360"," experience was because my experience yesterday was not fucking fun."
"4676020","4677660"," It was not cool, man. "
"4679260","4682260"," Let me tell you how gross I am."
"4682260","4685580"," So well, first of all, these were women, not men."
"4686200","4688400"," It was like two women and I was like, there's two kidding. "
"4688640","4689080"," I wasn't men."
"4689740","4691280"," And they're like, are you going to be okay?"
"4691280","4692100"," And I'm like, I'll be fine."
"4692280","4692780"," I was in the army. "
"4693120","4695560"," I've been brown naked dudes in gross conditions."
"4695960","4696660"," I've seen everything."
"4697780","4698900"," I'm like, I'll be fine. "
"4699460","4701340"," But I thought they found some enjoyment out of it."
"4701560","4703760"," Personally, think they found enjoyment out of it."
"4704320","4706320"," They were like, fuck yeah, this guy is ready to go. "
"4706920","4709080"," Grab the fucking 50 gallon tub of lube."
"4712260","4713640"," It was pretty fucking wild."
"4714080","4714880"," I wasn't happy. "
"4715060","4715500"," I'll say that."
"4715700","4716420"," I wasn't happy."
"4716520","4716980"," I was uncomfortable. "
"4718260","4719940"," And that happens yesterday."
"4720300","4721960"," So I've got a colonoscopy coming up."
"4722560","4727520"," I'll let you guys know when it happens so I can tell you how painful it was. "
"4728120","4729340"," But here's that warning."
"4729500","4735280"," If you're a man out there and you know of a dad and you're young, fight to get a colonoscopy"
"4735280","4736380"," before you turn 50."
"4737360","4738560"," Make sure you're doing it. "
"4738620","4743100"," Like when you hit 40, between 40 and 45, start asking for a colonoscopy."
"4744620","4748380"," Get it early so that you don't die of some ass cancer."
"4749220","4754160"," Like seriously, if you're a man out there, you know of a dad and your life, fight for one. "
"4754660","4760040"," If you have to fudge it, not no pun intended, but if you have to fudge it to get that"
"4760040","4762420"," done for you, stay at it."
"4762940","4764580"," Nobody cares about your health."
"4764580","4765840"," You're a man, right?"
"4766020","4767240"," You're likely have nobody. "
"4767580","4770080"," You likely don't have an advocate for you."
"4770080","4773900"," You likely don't tell your wife or your friends or your parents."
"4775340","4777220"," So I'm going to be an advocate for you. "
"4777740","4781280"," Go out there and don't be embarrassed."
"4782880","4788100"," Don't have any shame for it and fight for a colonoscopy."
"4788420","4791700"," You don't want to be you don't want to like go late and then find out you got cancer and"
"4791700","4792220"," you're going to die. "
"4793020","4793460"," You get me?"
"4794080","4796660"," All right, that's enough of colonoscopies and poop talk about a Friday."
"4802240","4804280"," So no, here's another thing."
"4804460","4806280"," So you guys don't know this about me. "
"4806660","4809560"," I cannot have general anesthesia."
"4810360","4812040"," I have an allergic reaction to it."
"4812140","4816740"," So every surgery I've ever had, I've been awake for. "
"4817260","4819240"," So I will be awake for that procedure."
"4820340","4821820"," So that sucks, doesn't it?"
"4822280","4823800"," I will be awake for that procedure."
"4827060","4828840"," No general anesthesia for me. "
"4830080","4833300"," Oh, they do put headies, heavy sedatives though."
"4833480","4833900"," Good, good, good."
"4834760","4835340"," That's good to hear. "
"4841270","4844010"," They don't put you totally under being told right now."
"4844490","4853330"," Yeah, I just had an operation six years ago and I've had two major operations"
"4853330","4856850"," since they found out I was allergic to general anesthesia."
"4857110","4861550"," Both were awake and the second one, I could feel the pain. "
"4861810","4862270"," It was the nightmare."
"4862570","4862810"," I screamed."
"4863250","4866030"," I screamed as loud as like, I've screamed scream bloody murder. "
"4866830","4869990"," You could hear me down the other side of the hospital in that operation."
"4870350","4874390"," They they, for some reason, didn't block the pain deep enough for me."
"4875110","4876710"," And I was screaming screaming. "
"4876950","4879410"," It was really it was the most pain I've ever felt my entire life."
"4880050","4882250"," Ever any any kind of pain I could have ever had."
"4885030","4888230"," What did I say to the doctor to get a colonoscopy?"
"4888510","4889710"," You guys want to know if you're a man?"
"4890410","4898410"," He told me to tell them that I had not incontinence, but that had lots of diarrhea and lots of"
"4898410","4905070"," mucus in my stool and that it was persistent over time. "
"4905930","4908010"," And that's what worked for me."
"4908430","4911370"," So if you ever want to know what worked for me, that's what it was."
"4917670","4918510"," How old am I?"
"4918790","4920190"," I'm 42 years old. "
"4920490","4922370"," So 42 years old."
"4922550","4923550"," So my my 40s."
"4924590","4926070"," I'm not I'm not a spring chicken. "
"4927910","4928990"," Oh, that's the other thing."
"4929110","4930470"," I thought about that afterwards too."
"4930850","4934830"," So when I was done, I wasn't thinking about the time. "
"4935070","4940130"," But when I left yesterday, when I left yesterday, I was like, oh shit, I didn't get I've always"
"4940130","4940470"," wanted."
"4940610","4942090"," I've always wanted to I'm not going to lie."
"4942670","4945610"," I've always wanted to experience milk in the prostate. "
"4945890","4946910"," I've never had it happen."
"4946910","4950250"," So I'm like afterwards, I'm like, I didn't come inside the office."
"4950250","4953890"," I was told that that could that a guy could come like a prostate. "
"4954430","4957970"," Like you're you could come from that shit, but I didn't that didn't happen to me."
"4958250","4959870"," I did think about it though afterwards."
"4959870","4962350"," I wouldn't have cared either. "
"4962430","4963510"," It's been like, I'm sorry, man."
"4963510","4964070"," It was involuntary."
"4964790","4965270"," Apologize. "
"4967930","4969310"," But it didn't happen to me."
"4969390","4969870"," Good question."
"4975430","4975910"," Yeah. "
"4976110","4981170"," So Deccan Dougie saying that my bro was diagnosed in his early 40s and passed away about six years"
"4981170","4981530"," later."
"4982830","4984870"," Shit is not as no jokes."
"4985510","4987990"," Say colon cancer runs in the family and they approve it. "
"4988430","4988950"," That's another one."
"4989070","4990010"," I did say that too."
"4990190","4991110"," I got to say that. "
"4991270","4996750"," I said that colon prostate and some other cancer."
"4997090","5002490"," I don't remember what I said, but they had me check off boxes and I said it was prevalent in"
"5002490","5005170"," my family and my dad's side and mom's side."
"5005670","5008850"," I did say that in that in the intake form. "
"5009110","5010430"," So that's a good point."
"5010610","5011270"," Thanks for saying that."
"5020970","5021510"," Yeah, yeah. "
"5021610","5025690"," If you're a man, if nobody's telling you to do that, get off your ass and do it."
"5025830","5026510"," Take care of yourself."
"5027230","5028850"," Please do that for yourself as a man. "
"5028990","5029390"," You'll be dead."
"5029870","5033930"," It's so it's like one of the worst things one of the worst ways you can die outside of lung"
"5033930","5037230"," cancer is some of the butt cancers that men get."
"5037750","5038990"," So you never want to be that guy. "
"5039050","5040170"," You don't want to die that way."
"5042590","5043030"," Yeah."
"5047250","5051390"," Sitting on a rug full here. "
"5052230","5054330"," Look at that yellow bar up there."
"5054430","5054770"," Look at this."
"5054850","5056570"," Look at that yellow bar right there, right?"
"5057090","5058150"," Just look at that right there. "
"5058850","5060310"," Trying to sell that weekly trigger."
"5060510","5061910"," What are we looking for right now?"
"5062730","5064130"," So hopefully you're flat with me."
"5065310","5073590"," What are you looking for though you're going to be looking for specifically. "
"5077090","5078410"," Let me see and draw this out."
"5078510","5079690"," So we tagged this one right here."
"5079790","5080710"," We did our job there. "
"5081590","5083070"," Do we get to our three?"
"5083330","5084450"," Do we get to the daily trigger?"
"5084730","5085310"," Do we get above?"
"5086290","5088870"," Is this going to be a huge reversal to the downside?"
"5089310","5090090"," We don't know, do we?"
"5090970","5092190"," We know this though."
"5092350","5099290"," We know that if we sit on the one minute trigger test it and we're successful though we'll go"
"5099290","5099970"," higher right."
"5100490","5105350"," So that would be some action like this right up up in a way. "
"5106090","5113730"," The other thing to think about though this is an important important lesson here is we is that we"
"5113730","5115790"," traded up on the one minute trigger."
"5116630","5119070"," We contested the weekly trigger right."
"5119930","5125490"," We likely need more help to go up there and break above right. "
"5126250","5130010"," So is the one minute trigger enough to get above?"
"5130630","5132230"," Not most of the time not."
"5132810","5136970"," Sometimes it is but mostly it's not."
"5137730","5139830"," The weekly trigger is usually stronger. "
"5140470","5146690"," Another fascinating point here would be if we do break above with just the one minute trigger it's"
"5146690","5153910"," likely coming back right like a like a rubber band will come back so the more we squeeze the more"
"5153910","5158750"," chances of us coming back to the hourly trigger down here right."
"5159630","5165090"," So and another fascinating thing here would be if we know that the one minute trigger is not as"
"5165090","5168450"," strong as the weekly trigger we likely need some help."
"5170030","5176150"," It's not abnormal to come back and test the five minute trigger. "
"5176650","5176830"," Why?"
"5177650","5184590"," We do that so that we find out if the buyers have moved up are they still down here?"
"5185630","5186410"," Are they over here?"
"5187170","5188090"," Are they over here?"
"5188830","5190190"," Are they over here right?"
"5190590","5193870"," So you got it we want to go back and check and see where they are."
"5194030","5194630"," Are they down here?"
"5194770","5196090"," Are they up here?"
"5196830","5199170"," Where are the real buyers?"
"5199630","5202830"," Where are the smart buyers right?"
"5204810","5209290"," So we're going to keep a green box right here."
"5209330","5218650"," Follow this green box and we're going to keep another green box down here on this half hour and"
"5218650","5219190"," hourly. "
"5219930","5228530"," Okay so we're going to keep these down here this is kind of like the the conservative buyers dip"
"5228530","5229570"," buy down here right."
"5229670","5234430"," So we're dip conservative buyer once you buy in any of that stuff right there right."
"5239750","5249270"," So right about there and look at HYG roll over in the background right watch that HYG rolling over"
"5249270","5256350"," it's coming back to test it's 27 EMA at 72 50. "
"5257570","5264530"," The VIX getting bloodbath right now raining down baby getting taken to the woodshed."
"5267880","5277740"," Apple coming in to retest it's 27 EMA Dixie looking bullish to 106 28"
"5277740","5279660"," for a rejection to the downside."
"5280500","5286820"," Tesla pulling back a little bit right now so we will pay attention and see if we can find a"
"5286820","5296700"," dip to buy 425 76 yeah so we're going to see"
"5296700","5300860"," see if we can let me see if I'm bring this weebull chart up really quick. "
"5301400","5303160"," So what are we looking for here right."
"5303760","5309360"," So weebull five minute chart we're still trading above right here right see me looking for some"
"5309360","5315000"," kind of a dip buy down over here and some kind of a dip buy down over here so as"
"5315000","5321120"," long as you can get in on this get a nice little nice little buy down there right come down"
"5321120","5328760"," here nice little buy up there right now price continues to hold this yellow line right and if we"
"5328760","5335120"," get the new high right here right if we trade this pull back you can take that for the next"
"5335120","5343040"," trade higher see that right there so remember the previous high listen to me closely okay so watch"
"5343040","5348520"," this right here we're going to do one minute chart right here nothing has changed in how we trade"
"5348520","5355520"," this stuff right you got the previous high right here right you got previous high right here right"
"5355520","5365080"," we're sitting on known support right here right the time right now is 12"
"5365080","5373360"," 17 so we have a three we've got 13 minutes right now for a bull to do what"
"5373360","5383020"," we got 13 minutes for a bull to get a new high"
"5383020","5392820"," so right there right so bull needs to price needs to break up here"
"5392820","5402680"," get the new high right come back down right then start to move higher right"
"5402680","5409920"," bam right there right and they'll get that that little yellow line that you see right there that"
"5409920","5417080"," little yellow line right there to the upside smash into that r3 right they've got 13 minutes to do"
"5417080","5424240"," it if they don't get the new high in the next 15 minutes what happens do you know do you"
"5424240","5429680"," know what happens we end up rolling to the downside right so if you don't get that new high you"
"5429680","5435220"," don't get this one right here and right now we don't have it doing so we'll likely roll back down"
"5435220","5444140"," and retest higher lows so we're going to express that right here and you're going to be watching"
"5444140","5452040"," this right here you want to see price get the new high even if it rejects it's showing buyer demand"
"5452040","5458720"," right here right showing demand for higher prices we'll keep an eye on it right now and if it"
"5458720","5463960"," doesn't if we don't get the new high in the next 13 minutes we will stay down here and look"
"5463960","5473500"," for a dip to buy down at r1 we'll wait for a dip to buy down at r1 so let's"
"5473500","5486040"," pay close attention to it close all that up hold on a second here so we"
"5486040","5495870"," can get this back on the chart on the screen for you right there put"

"5643770","5651330"," consolidate let that we let let that hourly trigger trigger help you out right this hourly trigger"
"5651330","5660740"," down here needs to come up and help you out right so look at the mechanics of this it's fairly"
"5660740","5675890"," simple right so you need price to go up here come on here so you"
"5675890","5688490"," need price to come up here right say into tuesday or something right so this is"
"5688490","5694430"," if you're a bull you need price up here but you what do you also need if you're a bull"
"5694430","5703910"," you need this guy right here you need hourly momentum to follow price up come all the way up here"
"5703910","5713030"," to give you a hand so you can continue higher right you're not out of the woods until right about"
"5713030","5718490"," there so if you're a buyer that's when you're out of the woods you are not out of the woods"
"5718490","5726090"," until that happens if that happens if that even happens so for right now this squeeze that we have"

"5766250","5785840"," something like that and something like that something"
"5785840","5794840"," like this this is something of what i'm looking for here into next week some kind of squeeze higher"
"5794840","5804760"," major leg down now this is expectations right uh if we get above the"
"5804760","5814060"," daily trigger if price gets above the daily trigger i will change my viewpoint if the hourly"
"5814060","5822320"," trigger comes up and supports price i will change my viewpoint that we're going higher okay now"
"5822320","5831660"," until that happens this is just another opportunity for sellers to step in right for that market"
"5831660","5841080"," crash so till we're above these two points and we confirm either of those two or no this top points"
"5841080","5845780"," most specifically it's not good enough to be above you have to confirm it and then then you can"
"5845780","5851900"," start heading higher so bulls have a lot of work here right uh and you're going to look for sellers"
"5851900","5860280"," into next week down below now i'm going to give you some warnings here okay um the hourly trigger"
"5860280","5867340"," if at any point price gets underneath it watch this one right here this point this uh this hourly"
"5867340","5874340"," trigger right if price at any point gets underneath so today tomorrow monday tuesday i don't care"
"5874340","5879480"," what it is if we reject and sell this whole rest of this day we bloodbath down and get underneath"
"5879480","5887220"," this hourly trigger i am bearish to the downside i am bearish on a crash so any price underneath"
"5887220","5893140"," hourly trigger not good any any rejection above at the weekly trigger price gets underneath the"
"5893140","5898940"," hourly trigger i am bearish i am extremely bearish underneath here okay so let me get rid of this"
"5898940","5905360"," right now so you can have it but here's my take into next week and this kind of fits the"
"5905360","5912800"," narrative narrative this kind of fits the narrative is that five days go to monday tuesday"
"5912800","5918120"," wednesday thursday fried this kind of fits the narrative uh for next week for what the expectation"
"5918120","5924200"," would be uh into next week can we fail right here can this be it can this be we fail"
"5924200","5933680"," down in next week yes can the weekly trigger be top yes can daily trigger be top yes but i'm"
"5933680","5938940"," going to expect some kind of squeezing up here and then we get all this news and bullshit minutes"
"5938940","5944820"," and we got a bunch of fucking economic data next week so if you're a bear this is your chance"
"5944820","5950000"," right here okay this is what you got uh if price today rejects and gets underneath the hourly"
"5950000","5959400"," trigger you got that if you're a bull your eyes are only on one thing your eyes are only on"
"5959400","5967220"," one thing pay attention here your eyes are on only one thing and that is getting above that daily"
"5967220","5971800"," trigger now then i'm going to show you another way to express that that i showed earlier this"
"5971800","5981420"," morning and that was the um that so what i just did with you there right is hold on here"
"5981420","5992540"," thing get rid of all this we'll just delete all that crap so you can see it so"
"5992540","6001500"," basically what my point to you is an easier way to express it would be bulls need to get up"
"6001500","6008560"," here i don't this is risky for bulls you know that you can't you know that in here bulls and"
"6008560","6014260"," bears can't tell you which way we're going right we could just as easily break down right there we"
"6014260","6020320"," could just as easily break up right there right so this is the no-go zone this is the don't"
"6020320","6026180"," fuck around zone right you don't want to be in there theta gang loves that shit right they'll eat"
"6026180","6033900"," you alive in here right but what bulls are looking for here is an escape they're looking for price"
"6033900","6043880"," up here break above here and start going above to attack that uh 444 reject and consolidate back"
"6043880","6049460"," down this is what a bull wants right here okay uh so get above the daily trigger is all a"
"6049460","6056620"," bull wants all you should be focused on here is that daily trigger getting above it and trying to"
"6056620","6065120"," attack 443 27 if you're a bear you need to reject this like you you you need to reject this"
"6065120","6070800"," stuff you need to be like rejecting that can't be having that shit can't be having that if you if"
"6070800","6076140"," we squeeze up here and they start to consolidate you need to get in there and sell this shit down"
"6076140","6082020"," to the downside if the bulls successfully break above and consolidate and start hitting higher"
"6082020","6087600"," you're going to get run over right there so if you're a seller we might remember something if you"
"6087600","6093940"," see a squeeze up here you see it consolidate it begins to break higher gets that new high and then"
"6093940","6101300"," holds on that turn around to the upside you are going to rect so stay focused if you're a seller"
"6101300","6110400"," in this zone right here stay focused if there is a rejection next week"
"6110400","6117800"," it would match up to the seasonality calendar right that would be where we go up here and then we"
"6117800","6123520"," roll for one more low down below and that's your season of low for october and then we're off and"
"6123520","6129240"," running again to the upside so just be aware that the seasonality calendar has some kind of built "
"6129240","6135900","-in possibility of more downside over here it could come in the next uh for next week could come by"
"6135900","6143320"," friday uh in that window will expire after friday of next week uh so you can pay attention to it"
"6143320","6149520"," uh you are watching right now the hourly hourly trigger is still not coming up uh that's some cause"
"6149520","6155400"," for concern i want to see this i want to see this green zig zagging higher and it's not happening"
"6155400","6162160"," so we'll wait for it to get up there in my expectation for next week is this uh my expectation"
"6162160","6167040"," for next week is bulls are not out of the out of the uh woodshed yet they're not out of"
"6167040","6173300"," the closet yet they're not out of the woods yet until the bulls can get above the daily trigger uh"
"6173300","6179900"," the bears remain in charge sellers remain in charge regardless of your news today sellers still"
"6179900","6186520"," remain in charge the market crash gang is still in charge of this market and uh they they still own"
"6186520","6192540"," it so uh if you are a bull you have some work to do you have some work cut out"
"6192540","6201200"," for you uh in what you have to do you must get above that 434 31 you do not have"
"6201200","6208160"," a choice you do do not have a choice and i'm gonna leave you with one last warning i'll leave"
"6208160","6217020"," you with one last warning if the bulls do not escape that daily trigger quickly uh most examples in"
"6217020","6224920"," previous history show a violent move to the downside so do you heed my warning here if you're a"
"6224920","6233680"," bull and you are not above that daily trigger there is crazy risk of us still rolling this market"
"6233680","6240660"," to the downside in a very very violent way you do not want to be long this market like i"
"6240660","6249140"," own this market and i come in on monday and we're down 7% 5% 3 and a half"
"6249140","6256480"," percent 10% like i'm gonna give you that warning if you're a bull do not fuck around with these"
"6256480","6262720"," bears they are waiting on the weekly they're waiting on the daily they know where it is they know"
"6262720","6267880"," where they come in to to dump this market to the depths of elle and there are bankers out there"
"6267880","6275260"," that are hoping for this to happen so like take like tread softly if you're a bull please please do"
"6275260","6281620"," me a solid don't come here on monday if we're down 7% and you say i wasn't prepared or"
"6281620","6286880"," i didn't have a hedge on or you know like i had a bunch of zero-day calls for monday"
"6286880","6294720"," like that crazy shit right i spent my whole entire month paycheck on on friday for monday call zero "
"6294720","6299860","-day calls for monday and i just blew up everything i go back and get a second job at Wendy's"
"6299860","6304820"," or something don't don't tell me that i'm on monday so i need you to be aware of that okay"
"6304820","6313980"," bulls need to be above 434 i promise you and they are they are not safe until they are this"
"6316770","6358480"," is jamie dim and have his bear suit on mr"
"6361140","6367100"," marko has spoke so pissed this morning that low on you telling telling like old grandma's out"
"6367100","6372320"," there, you got Marco, you got Marco out there telling all these old women out there, these old men"
"6372320","6379600"," like your 85 year old man and they got Marco from JPM going out there and you're scared, you're"
"6379600","6382920"," like, oh, Marco from JPM told me we're going down 20%."
"6382920","6389380"," Not today, we aren't not today. "
"6393160","6396120"," We're Paco's postpone till Monday at the earliest."
"6403010","6404330"," What are you asking me?"
"6404950","6411930"," So I bought a bunch of calls on Tuesday, call spreads based upon market prep indicator."
"6413170","6414330"," Let's take a look at that real quick. "
"6415250","6419650"," So based on market breath, I bought a bunch of call spreads for December 29th."
"6420990","6423670"," What I'll do today is I'll watch where we are."
"6424710","6426550"," It's fairly easy for me. "
"6427510","6429250"," I really don't care where we are."
"6429470","6429850"," I don't care."
"6430170","6432050"," Well, I mean, not that I do or don't care. "
"6434570","6439350"," But the only thing that I care about into Monday is are we above daily trigger."
"6439770","6440570"," I think that's for me."
"6440570","6443550"," So if I'm a bull, you guys all know him a bull, right?"
"6444270","6444950"," We must. "
"6445410","6448170"," I must see the market above 434."
"6448670","6455130"," If I don't see the market above 434 into next week, I'm buying a shit bag ton full of puts."
"6456550","6460550"," And I own like DJI stuff. "
"6460710","6466490"," I own like Verizon and Budweiser and Tyson Foods and all that crap, but I'm holding that for like"
"6466490","6467330"," three to five years."
"6467630","6469070"," So I don't really put that in the conversation."
"6470230","6474510"," I need to do some protect on that with spy puts in the clothes. "
"6474950","6479810"," But other than that, that price is king."
"6480330","6486270"," Like 434 is like a magic fucking number right now."
"6486770","6488410"," And 435 would be even better. "
"6489150","6490550"," I don't think a magic number for bulls."
"6492290","6496610"," Until that until I see that number, no matter where we are, close today."
"6497690","6499850"," But so we put on the market without a doubt. "
"6500510","6504210"," 35 cent puts on case they roll this shit down."
"6505230","6506710"," And we'll look at them at the end of the day."
"6506910","6512690"," So before 4 p.m., if there's like some 3 cent or 5 cent puts, we'll take a look at"
"6512690","6516070"," some puts for next week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. "
"6522560","6523700"," Let's see what you guys are saying."
"6538820","6540120"," Yeah, I'm not willing to buy."
"6540220","6541620"," I'm not willing to trade the puts either. "
"6541820","6542260"," Who said that?"
"6542680","6545980"," So puts aren't meant to make you money."
"6547020","6551240"," If you're going to short the market, I think that's a better thing to do."
"6551760","6554080"," I don't mind puts on SPX. "
"6554700","6556180"," But SPY puts suck."
"6556940","6560160"," And the only thing they're good for in my view is like protection."
"6560700","6564420"," Like 1 cents, 3 cents, it better fucking move. "
"6564660","6567900"," Like it better fucking move to the downside side."
"6569000","6570780"," I was talking to a buddy last night."
"6570820","6572140"," I was talking to my buddy Sam last night. "
"6572320","6575380"," And I was like, I tried to simplify it for him."
"6575440","6577020"," And I was like, nothing he couldn't understand."
"6577260","6580380"," And I think he understood the concepts fine, but I was like, let's simplify this. "
"6580380","6583900"," And if I own a hundred spy and spy costs $100."
"6584920","6585940"," Spy costs $100."
"6586120","6588040"," I own spy at $100. "
"6588440","6589140"," And I own a hundred contracts."
"6591160","6593400"," You know, they're for a hundred bucks, right?"
"6593600","6598240"," So if I'm Jamie Diamond or Damon, right?"
"6599000","6604520"," So I was trying to explain like the Jamie Diamond positioning or the Marco positioning, right?"
"6605520","6610220"," So if I'm Jamie Diamond from Marco or something like that, let's say I own a hundred shares."
"6611080","6617580"," And we're coming into a place where there's some real risk in the market where I could lose money"
"6617580","6620620"," against my spy that I'm holding, right?"
"6621980","6623120"," So what do I get to do?"
"6624080","6629040"," I get to take some money out and I get to protect that spy at $100. "
"6630380","6637680"," So, or I have to protect that spy at $100, right?"
"6637680","6643960"," Okay, if we're going to crash here, I need to spend X amount of dollars, right?"
"6644640","6647960"," So I own a hundred spy at $100, right?"
"6648700","6651480"," So I say now I've got a hundred bucks to spend."
"6651560","6654940"," So I buy a bunch of shitty fucking puts, right?"
"6655720","6659140"," Now, if the market doesn't crash, then it goes up, right?"
"6659980","6662480"," $205, I'm fine, right?"
"6663000","6664000"," So the market goes with $105."
"6665040","6671960"," I don't make a ton of money because I already spent $200 or $300, maybe even $400 on puts, right?"
"6672660","6673600"," But we go to $105. "
"6674000","6675100"," We don't go down."
"6675340","6676140"," I only made a dollar."
"6676420","6677940"," I didn't make a ton of money. "
"6678260","6679360"," I didn't have to pick the direction."
"6679720","6680600"," We went to $105."
"6681180","6686200"," My investment, though, is safe with a modest increase in value, right?"
"6686500","6689840"," Now, Jamie Diamond buys those puts, right?"
"6690880","6692140"," So he's like, I bought puts. "
"6693380","6696940"," He's like, if spy goes $105, I don't care."
"6697520","6698100"," I made money."
"6699120","6701900"," I also protected my investment, right?"
"6702200","6703260"," Time to protect my investment. "
"6703480","6708420"," But because I bought those puts, if there's a chance we can go down, I'll probably make a ton of"
"6708420","6709740"," money, even if it's only briefly."
"6710500","6714260"," So what do I do if I'm Jamie Diamond or Marco or one of those guys, right?"
"6714440","6716900"," They're protecting their investments, like right now."
"6718160","6723800"," They go on fucking CNBC and they suck each other off and they beg. "
"6725200","6727940"," These are rich fucking white old men."
"6728600","6735000"," These are guys that bitch and moan about you being on unemployment."
"6735600","6740500"," These are guys that bitch and moan about you being on Section 8."
"6741240","6745200"," These are guys that bitch and moan about you working from home. "
"6745200","6748480"," They bitch and moan about you not working hard enough."
"6748760","6751080"," They bitch and moan about how much they're paying you."
"6751740","6752480"," That's what they do. "
"6753620","6754900"," And guess what they get to do?"
"6755720","6756960"," Guess what they get to do?"
"6757800","6759160"," They get to own the market."
"6759980","6764560"," They get to hedge that market and they don't care if it goes up or down."
"6765240","6771120"," But if they can take a quick snort of cocaine on that hedge that they have, they're going to do"
"6771120","6771280"," it. "
"6771800","6772820"," Do you get to do that?"
"6772820","6775800"," Do you get to buy the S&P 500?"
"6777280","6782680"," Do you get to then hedge against that danger to that position?"
"6783760","6784740"," Right hedge."
"6785540","6791940"," And then do you get to go on to CNBC and beg for free payments for that hedge?"
"6792800","6793140"," Fuck no."
"6793920","6794620"," You're poor. "
"6795660","6796240"," You're a pleb."
"6797040","6798480"," You're a fucking nobody."
"6799040","6799840"," It's not your market. "
"6799840","6801460"," But can you imagine that?"
"6801680","6808160"," Can you imagine that you get to go on to CNBC and beg for free money every week or two?"
"6808580","6811520"," Every three, four weeks because you hedge your position."
"6812840","6814400"," You know, you don't care if it goes up."
"6814440","6815720"," You're still going to make some money. "
"6816280","6820340"," But if you get that little down move, you get to pay for that hedge."
"6820500","6821680"," You get to pay for your position."
"6822460","6825240"," Instead of 10%, you're up 30% now, right?"
"6826360","6827140"," You don't get to do that. "
"6827220","6828040"," I don't get to do that."
"6828040","6833600"," Do I get to buy the S&P 500 and then buy a bunch of puts for Monday and then"
"6833600","6834720"," they interview me?"
"6835540","6836020"," Right."
"6836420","6839420"," So I can tell you doom and gloom's coming, baby. "
"6842480","6844060"," Can you imagine that?"
"6844260","6846920"," You get to go on CNBC and beg for fucking welfare."
"6847900","6850660"," And these are people that bitch at you as a pleb."
"6851000","6851980"," You're not doing enough. "
"6852780","6856940"," Do you get to go on CNBC and beg for your hedge to print?"
"6857580","6859060"," I'm going to go with a big fat no."
"6860420","6861820"," They're like the biggest offenders."
"6862600","6867600"," Like the biggest shit bags in the world are all these all these fat old white men, rich white men. "
"6867720","6868380"," They say you're not."
"6871200","6875440"," They're like the epitome of shit bags."
"6885680","6887800"," I'm being abusive to Jamie Dimon. "
"6890900","6893020"," I'm being mean to an old rich white guy."
"6894900","6897280"," I'm sure I'm sure I'm making their day horrible."
"6899000","6908090"," Yeah, you could do a putback spread. "
"6908230","6908810"," I like those here."
"6909450","6910350"," Putback spreads are good."
"6911230","6911530"," I dig it. "
"6911530","6913630"," I don't know that we're going down enough though for those."
"6914590","6916610"," I guess I'd make them really wild or something."
"6919130","6922770"," You'd have to like I'd have to think about the putback spread because like how much time do you put"
"6922770","6923090"," on it?"
"6923630","6924930"," How deep do you think we're going?"
"6925750","6926490"," Kind of stuff. "
"6926550","6927990"," The reverse is on you to the upside."
"6930830","6935710"," I just like I think I think in this position specifically like some one or three cent puts."
"6936410","6939650"," I think if they're going to crash this shit, it's going to happen like over the weekend. "
"6939650","6941510"," Pick them down until Monday."
"6942430","6944150"," Maybe Tuesday or Wednesday."
"6945050","6946450"," It'll be if it happens. "
"6946990","6947710"," Fuck it, right?"
"6948270","6952170"," Let's burn some tires down Main Street and our Broadway and New York City."
"6953570","6955730"," They're going to burn this market to the ground."
"6956010","6957330"," Let's ride it for pennies. "
"6962350","6971180"," Yeah, puts kind of suck."
"6975010","6977010"," They're not built for making money, man."
"6977350","6982250"," Like you make money here and there, but nobody's buying those fucking things and making money"
"6982250","6982530"," consistently. "
"6983130","6983550"," They're garbage."
"6986310","6987210"," Hold on a second."
"6987350","6987830"," I'll be right back. "
"6987930","6988950"," Give me five five seconds."
"6989070","6989330"," Hold on."
"6993210","6993770"," Oh, yeah. "
"6994010","6995170"," Here we fucking go, man."
"6995610","6997550"," Spy holding on to the one minute trigger."
"6998590","6998890"," Spy. "
"7000330","7003710"," Staying bullish here trying to go up and slap."
"7003710","7006350"," That weekly trigger."
"7007670","7008250"," Spoon's nose. "
"7008710","7009550"," It needs to go higher."
"7010530","7011790"," Let me just a couple seconds here."
"7011870","7012630"," I'll be right back with you. "
"7100110","7100470"," Okay."
"7101390","7102990"," Well, give me one more second here."
"7103030","7103670"," I'll be right back with you guys. "
"7103770","7104990"," I got some stuff talked to you guys about."
"7104990","7105270"," Hold on."
"7130510","7136730"," How can Marco be so wrong and have a job?"
"7136730","7143330"," So, uh, I am a client of JPM. "
"7144790","7147830"," And, uh, what, what they tell me."
"7150570","7154570"," What they tell me as a client is different."
"7155810","7163950"," Then what, um, then what they tell, what, what Marco and Jamie Diamond tells you. "
"7165070","7172590"," So, if you're a client of JPM or any of these banks, uh, they, they have different messages."
"7176190","7179110"," They have different messages for different people."
"7180410","7181230"," See here. "
"7181510","7182950"," I don't know if I need this here."
"7183830","7184450"," Color block."
"7185210","7185670"," But wait a minute. "
"7186130","7186690"," Did I do that right?"
"7188150","7192210"," So, they have different messages for different people."
"7193330","7196150"," And they have a duty and responsibility."
"7198270","7200090"," Uh, to their clients, right?"
"7200470","7203870"," So, like Marco, I tried to just try to explain it to you. "
"7203970","7207150"," So, like if they own the market, right?"
"7207330","7208370"," So, they own the market."
"7209170","7212070"," They win if we go up and they win if we go down."
"7212790","7218070"," They win more if we go down with that, uh, with that hedging on the market, right?"
"7218070","7222590"," So, so it, it serves them either way is the point, right?"
"7222850","7223090"," Sir. "
"7223210","7224790"," So if we go down, they make extra."
"7225510","7227930"," If we go up, they make good money, right?"
"7228190","7231730"," So it's been, hey, it's a good month or it's a great month, right?"
"7231950","7239690"," So it doesn't hurt them to go out there and shit post on, uh, CNBC, right?"
"7239910","7242070"," You don't get to do that, but they do, right?"
"7242850","7245290"," But they can go out there and shit post all they want, right?"
"7245590","7247490"," And they, and they have no reason not to, right?"
"7247490","7250190"," They have to protect their investment, have a hedge on."
"7250770","7252470"," If it, if it goes down, all the better. "
"7252630","7255810"," If it doesn't, if it goes up, it doesn't matter to them, right?"
"7256390","7257590"," They win no matter what."
"7257950","7260970"," Bear seagulls are kind of similar in that same, uh, effect at least."
"7261190","7264170"," Or there's a similar effect in bear seagulls as well. "
"7278480","7282280"," I just got a message, uh, I just got a message."
"7282680","7284100"," So I'm going to talk to you guys."
"7284820","7287900"," I said that I would do a training class today. "
"7288600","7293620"," Uh, for the rest of the day at some point, but I would do a training class for the tool."
"7295480","7298380"," And I don't know if I have enough time to do that today."
"7298380","7302760"," So what I think I'm going to do here is, uh, I'm going to schedule. "
"7304100","7304580"," Schedule."
"7307280","7311080"," Uh, for us to do this Saturday."
"7312460","7314560"," I have a game in the morning on Saturday. "
"7314560","7316280"," They have to go with my daughter too."
"7316420","7325480"," She plays, um, sports, but in the afternoon, I'm available, uh, but I want it to be clean."
"7326620","7334380"," And I also don't want, uh, I think we have an audience that's focused on how we close today out. "
"7334380","7342160"," So there's a conflict of, um, wanting to get the tool to, or the tool video and where we close"
"7342160","7342600"," today."
"7342600","7347320"," So I'm being told in the background to focus on the market, uh, which is fine."
"7347600","7348940"," And I'm not in the stream with that. "
"7349160","7352620"," So what we'll do is, uh, I'll make the video."
"7353260","7361280"," I'm going to do a live stream on Saturday at, uh, roughly don't hold me to this, but roughly 12"
"7361280","7361900"," o'clock."
"7362220","7365080"," Could be like 11 a.m. 12 o'clock or one o'clock. "
"7365220","7368840"," It depends on when I get done with this game, uh, with my, my daughter."
"7369300","7371720"," But somewhere in that vicinity, I'm going to come on Saturday."
"7372920","7377880"," And you don't have to be here, but if you have the tool, you should be here. "
"7378400","7380930"," Uh, and if not, though, you can watch, uh, the videos afterwards."
"7382020","7384960"," Uh, they'll be condensed and cut up and all that kind of stuff."
"7385660","7391400"," Uh, you can watch them on your own time, but Saturday, 12 o'clock, tentatively tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"7391940","7394420"," I'm going to do just a dedicated live stream on a Saturday. "
"7394980","7397700"," Uh, we'll get through just the exact, just the tool."
"7398240","7402540"," And if the markets are closed, it'll be easy to, um, uh, as well."
"7402560","7405940"," It'll be easy to go through all this stuff with the markets closed anyways. "
"7410600","7412860"," It'll be recorded and it's going to be edited."
"7413520","7417960"," And if there's going to be like, uh, a full, a full, like video program."
"7418580","7420460"," And then there's going to be segments separated. "
"7422100","7425220"," So you can digest it every like 10 minutes or five minute increments."
"7426260","7430100"," Um, but you can watch the whole entire thing as one video."
"7430520","7434760"," And then if you want to just watch individual videos, we're going to have those made as well for"
"7434760","7434960"," you. "
"7439620","7440060"," Mm."
"7441780","7447720"," Not only will it be recorded, uh, but it's going to be available at minimum."
"7449340","7450220"," Two members. "
"7451340","7455460"," Uh, so if you're a member, you'll always have access to those videos."
"7455460","7458580"," I think I'm going to leave them public though for right now."
"7459280","7465000"," Um, they might always stay public, but, um, I haven't made a decision there yet. "
"7465000","7466020"," One way or another."
"7467040","7469760"," Um, I mean, for no reason either."
"7469880","7473760"," I don't know if we're going to keep in public or private or just for members or not, but. "
"7475260","7478160"," Or what the reasoning would be, whether they're public or not, I guess."
"7478420","7479380"," I don't know what the reason is."
"7479440","7480100"," I just want to get help. "
"7480340","7483820"," Yeah, we're going to leave in public if we're going to leave them only for members, but there will"
"7483820","7484580"," be a record of it."
"7484580","7486020"," And you'll have access to it."
"7486640","7490380"," Uh, for the next week or two, they'll be public for the next week or two. "
"7497180","7500480"," So the tool right now, uh, there's a good question."
"7500720","7502640"," So the tools, well, number one."
"7503680","7506880"," I would like to take the focus off of this tool. "
"7506920","7508940"," We have a lot of tools coming your way."
"7509940","7512460"," Um, that are better than this tool."
"7513120","7516780"," In my view, like the stock picking tools, bad ass. "
"7517380","7519020"," Uh, it's a, it's very consistent."
"7519980","7524660"," Um, but saying that, uh, the idea here is."
"7525400","7529260"," I gave the tool to administrators, moderators. "
"7530920","7534160"," Uh, and some long time members."
"7535040","7536880"," To beta test the tool."
"7537560","7542020"," Uh, the plan would be that they have access to it for a few days. "
"7542980","7545020"," Uh, just to observe it."
"7545800","7550680"," Uh, just to watch out how it acts and what it means and what it doesn't mean and get familiar."
"7551780","7553020"," The step two. "
"7553740","7556820"," Is to, uh, do a video."
"7557980","7559860"," Series for those people."
"7560300","7561140"," To watch. "
"7562660","7567280"," And comment on in case I need to change those videos."
"7568060","7573100"," Uh, and then we're going to release a white paper that matches those videos."
"7574020","7577160"," That should take place over the weekend into next week. "
"7577940","7584880"," Uh, once that happens, uh, we will open it up to you, uh, to have access to that tool and"
"7584880","7585480"," some other tools."
"7586140","7588860"," Uh, so you'll be able to get access to the tool."
"7588860","7590480"," And the reason we're doing that is so. "
"7590940","7596660"," That, uh, once you get the tool, you're going to have, uh, people that are trained with its use."
"7597580","7602220"," Uh, people that have already watched the videos already read the white paper already punch list"
"7602220","7602780"," this thing."
"7603120","7607640"," So if you have questions, uh, they'll be answered, uh, appropriately. "
"7608400","7611340"," What I don't want to do is have give access to general public."
"7611340","7618120"," And not have anybody, uh, core group of people that are aware of it at least or understand its"
"7618120","7618900"," mechanics at least."
"7619380","7620700"," Even if they don't trade it, they get that. "
"7620860","7624020"," If you're, if you're a member, if I was a member."
"7625580","7627600"," And I talked to a moderator or admin."
"7627600","7629140"," I'd be like, Hey, what do you know about this thing?"
"7629260","7634080"," Or where can I go to watch some videos or where can I read this or, uh, how does this"
"7634080","7635880"," work or misunderstanding this?"
"7636060","7638720"," You kind of want people there to answer those questions for you. "
"7639180","7642120"," Um, to the best of their ability, right?"
"7642320","7642620"," And we'll grow."
"7642840","7645040"," This is a learning and growing process as well."
"7645400","7649020"," So it's going to take, you know, two, three months, four months, roll it all out. "
"7649460","7650560"," Get everybody feeling good."
"7650740","7651460"," You're at the ground floor."
"7651980","7653660"," Uh, so think about it like this. "
"7655700","7661740"," You're not, uh, walking into something that's been there for five or ten years."
"7662480","7668140"," And, uh, has established friendships and, uh, groups of people and all this other stuff."
"7668140","7669400"," Kind of in the ground floor. "
"7669640","7671380"," So, uh, it's, it'll be fun."
"7671980","7676380"," Uh, you should have some enjoyment, uh, watching this unfold and, um, grow into something."
"7680990","7682690"," Now they're trying to roll it right now, aren't they?"
"7684310","7686230"," Trying to roll it right now down to that five minute. "
"7689700","7691320"," They are trying, aren't they?"
"7693000","7695120"," I want to break above this so I can trade it."
"7695500","7699880"," Like I want to buy this right there."
"7699960","7700520"," I want to buy that. "
"7700520","7705680"," And I want to buy that five minute pullback or that hourly pull, half hour pullback down there or"
"7705680","7706360"," something like that."
"7706860","7707900"," Something like that."
"7708160","7708900"," Buy something like this. "
"7709080","7709640"," I don't want to buy this."
"7709840","7711180"," So it's not enough, not enough juice."
"7712740","7713760"," Not enough juice. "
"7714200","7715140"," You have to get above there."
"7715580","7716820"," Take that trade right there."
"7718560","7721720"," So until that happens, what until any of one of those things happen. "
"7722120","7723360"," Just waiting for a dip buy."
"7730470","7731550"," Good question, Brian."
"7733910","7734390"," Um. "
"7737430","7741830"," Uh, AMC above AMC is above nine dollars."
"7741930","7742410"," Congratulations."
"7742730","7744770"," I wanted to bring up AMC this morning too. "
"7745410","7747930"," But AMC's been bullish for like three days, hasn't it?"
"7748290","7749370"," I mean, I love AMC."
"7749690","7751630"," I just, it's been bullish for like three days."
"7752110","7754810"," GME was looking like dog shit heading into this morning. "
"7754970","7755430"," Was it worth it?"
"7755710","7759650"," Uh, like AMC kind of gave the knot a few days ago, I think."
"7759650","7761350"," I could be wrong there, but I think they did."
"7772090","7774890"," Another cool part about moving it to tomorrow. "
"7775530","7781090"," If you have questions as we make that video, I'll better be able to answer them for you."
"7781610","7786350"," So if you're a modern administrator, we make that video tomorrow and you're like, how does this"
"7786350","7786590"," work?"
"7786750","7787350"," How does that work?"
"7788470","7789950"," When does when do you know that this fails?"
"7790850","7792930"," You're going to have that time as well to ask those questions."
"7792950","7795090"," I will answer your direct questions tomorrow. "
"7795670","7797810"," I think there's like 20 or 30 of you."
"7797930","7804450"," So if there's like 20 or 30 of us in that show tomorrow, we could just talk, we could even"
"7804450","7805770"," do it private if you wanted to."
"7806730","7813410"," We could do something where if you really wanted to, we could do like a, let me ask you guys,"
"7813690","7816690"," if you're a moderator or an administrator, we could do something cool. "
"7817290","7821330"," We could do something where it's more like a meeting."
"7821990","7826450"," Like a video meeting where like there's 100 of you, 20, like 30 of you and a Google meet or"
"7826450","7826810"," something."
"7827690","7830010"," We do round table drink, some bears or something. "
"7831090","7832550"," Think about that in the background."
"7833210","7836170"," I don't know if it's required, but we could do like that."
"7836730","7842410"," We could do a private YouTube too, or it's a private YouTube stream and like 28 of you. "
"7842490","7845790"," You could put an invitation inside of that discord channel."
"7846390","7848110"," Only you would have access to it."
"7848790","7849890"," We could do it privately. "
"7850430","7855210"," So if you don't want like the public there, if you're an administrator, moderator, you don't want"
"7855210","7858970"," the regular member watching you or general John public watching you."
"7859410","7861690"," We could do it private on Saturday."
"7862130","7863690"," So it's like just 30 of us. "
"7865090","7866210"," You'd feel more comfortable."
"7866210","7866870"," Maybe I don't know."
"7873490","7875170"," Good service for back testing. "
"7878570","7879230"," Hold on."
"7879310","7879990"," I'll bring it up."
"7880070","7880470"," Give me a second. "
"7898000","7899200"," What is my favorite?"
"7899400","7900460"," I haven't used them in some time."
"7900740","7902200"," I haven't used them in over a year."
"7906240","7907400"," Oh, that's interesting. "
"7909180","7910700"," I don't like any of these companies."
"7918130","7921410"," Let's see if I can trade well."
"7921610","7922470"," It's called trade well. "
"7923750","7924790"," So it's trade."
"7925070","7928650"," It's www dot trade well dot APP."
"7929670","7930890"," Look up trade well. "
"7931070","7933290"," There's I just looked at recommendations on Google."
"7933410","7934330"," Do not do."
"7934490","7934790"," I'm not. "
"7934790","7935590"," I shouldn't say that."
"7935970","7938270"," If you like using these other companies, that's fine."
"7938330","7939430"," Trade well is my favorite. "
"7940750","7943510"," The best the best app that I've found for back testing."
"7944130","7944970"," Good question."
"7954730","7955990"," Trade well is the answer. "
"7964960","7970280"," Okay, so I'm being told right now by a producer that Saturday will work."
"7970680","7970840"," So."
"7972240","7973640"," And we're going to make it private. "
"7973740","7976680"," So it looks like we'll do that video tomorrow."
"7976740","7979860"," Private for just people that have it."
"7979860","7982200"," So I'm going to make an announcement right now. "
"7982220","7982480"," Okay."
"7983460","7986360"," If you have access to the tool."
"7987900","7990080"," And you want to be in the meeting. "
"7991180","7994800"," In the or in the educational series videos."
"7996860","8001260"," I will post a link a private link for you."
"8001800","8006680"," In the multi channel moderator channel that's on discord. "
"8007440","8012840"," So you're going to get that posted around 12 o'clock in the afternoon tomorrow."
"8013840","8018580"," So you'll just show up into that room and you'll click through the video and you'll be in that room"
"8018580","8019020"," privately."
"8020300","8024700"," And I'm the only thing that'll ask you is if you're have access if you have access to that tool. "
"8025200","8027280"," Do not share that link, please."
"8027640","8029020"," I'm going to ask you that right now."
"8029660","8031580"," Do not share that link that I give you tomorrow. "
"8031620","8038680"," Make sure it's just amongst all of us so we can speak privately and frankly and sit back and learn"
"8038680","8039120"," together."
"8040420","8045080"," So that'll be a private video for tomorrow for people with access to the tool."
"8049170","8051350"," Oh, and by the way, cowboy up. "
"8051870","8053610"," I saw your DM but didn't read it."
"8054230","8056290"," I will read it today at some point."
"8057130","8059210"," And I'll chat with you in the side. "
"8060270","8064330"," I got you cowboy up."
"8067980","8069180"," Skull and bones, baby."
"8071200","8075980"," J-roll said on Twitter that AMC had over a thousand percent sold puts. "
"8076760","8078720"," That always would give a nice bounce within a week."
"8079020","8080640"," Yeah, AMC like looked bullish."
"8081480","8086760"," In my view, so this morning I looked at AMC and GME and I was like, AMC is kind of"
"8086760","8087860"," already telling you it's going to rip. "
"8088660","8091400"," GME though, man, was looking really fucked up, right?"
"8092860","8094140"," GME was not looking good."
"8096000","8098100"," Well, this one was still looking really weak."
"8105790","8107770"," Two of you guys are saying on chat this morning. "
"8108490","8111870"," Three through some chat."
"8112110","8113030"," See what you guys are saying."
"8120030","8125570"," Super bear old man said I may be too old of a man but no one should be playing GME"
"8125570","8125950"," upside. "
"8127570","8128770"," It's like gas."
"8129090","8130510"," It's like trading gas, right?"
"8130730","8131250"," Netty gas."
"8133150","8135370"," It's almost as bad as trading netty gas. "
"8137790","8139670"," I agree with you, super bear old man."
"8141850","8144210"," It's not be good for you to stay on Saturday right on."
"8144370","8144650"," Good job. "
"8154380","8156220"," Yeah, super bear old man."
"8156380","8158820"," I did notice that name change as well, brother."
"8159080","8160120"," I did notice the name change. "
"8160120","8165500"," I did notice the name change, brother."
"8168820","8175340"," And just remember, too."
"8175580","8179900"," I want to be careful about my verbiage here. "
"8180120","8181360"," I got to say something to you."
"8182340","8184620"," If we get above 434, right?"
"8185480","8189740"," Remember, please remember this successful retest of that number."
"8189960","8193120"," Okay, so we break above it successfully retest. "
"8193120","8198340"," And a lot of times we'll break above that number and not that specific to this number today, but"
"8198340","8201280"," we'll break above that resistance like that daily resistance."
"8201860","8204660"," We'll come back down and retest it and we fail."
"8205200","8206660"," It's a big time bull trap. "
"8206900","8209040"," So like you don't want to be long above."
"8209320","8214200"," You want to wait for that retest and then get safe or then get comfortable once it holds to make"
"8214200","8214900"," sure that it holds."
"8223520","8225360"," Oh, the Sam's in the chat right now. "
"8225400","8225920"," What's up, brother?"
"8226639","8230620"," You want me to share that Gandalf image?"
"8232440","8239000"," I don't think I have access to it right here, but Sam sent me something the other day."
"8240920","8245780"," Sam sent me a meme posted on Twitter, man."
"8251049","8252070"," Oh, cowboy up. "
"8252170","8253190"," I thought you DM me, brother."
"8257620","8259580"," I thought I had a DM for me, man."
"8261180","8262080"," I'll check, dude. "
"8262219","8264820"," I think it said that I got DM'd on Twitter."
"8265740","8266900"," I could be wrong, dude."
"8267320","8267879"," Cowboy up. "
"8268240","8269760"," I swear I got a DM for me, man."
"8270260","8272980"," I'll check and see, but I swear I got a DM."
"8273180","8275320"," Maybe it's a fake account. "
"8276059","8277719"," It could be a fake account, man."
"8277719","8279219"," I'll check again today."
"8286260","8288360"," Oh, so a couple of things. "
"8288799","8289959"," Will Mead here."
"8290440","8292139"," Will Mead, do you have the tool?"
"8293600","8294900"," And stretching walls."
"8298020","8301100"," So stretching walls, give me your trading view. "
"8301980","8303660"," Give me your trading view."
"8305379","8307860"," Give me your trading view handle, brother."
"8307860","8310440"," Exact trading view user name. "
"8311059","8313100"," Exact trading view user name."
"8313780","8316680"," And also give me your discord name."
"8317520","8318180"," So ready?"
"8319580","8323160"," Maybe I should maybe I'm asking you if you're ready, but in reality, I wasn't ready. "
"8324139","8328100"," This is a message for stretching walls."
"8328680","8332840"," Give me your exact user name for discord."
"8334559","8338799"," Not the one that's on the face of your posts, but the one behind the scenes. "
"8339440","8342760"," So give me your real discord user name and chat right here."
"8343299","8345900"," And then give me your trading view user name in this chat."

"8358200","8358480"," Awesome."
"8360559","8364420"," Not bad having that honorary moderator title, huh?"
"8365139","8366280"," Pretty good, isn't it?"
"8368120","8370200"," Oh, there's Knick Mobile over there."
"8370440","8371120"," Look at Knick Mobile. "
"8371840","8375580"," Look at Knick Mobile over there."
"8380980","8383680"," Knick, you're already a moderator, brother."
"8385680","8386440"," Wait a minute. "
"8386520","8390060"," Knick Mobile saying he doesn't have access to mod to the mod discord."
"8391000","8391740"," Okay, hold on."
"8392460","8393080"," Knick Mobile. "
"8397700","8399660"," All right, I'll add you to the discord."
"8400740","8402300"," Same exact name I got you."
"8403200","8403820"," Stretching walls. "
"8404160","8405260"," Is that your same name on discord?"
"8406380","8406960"," Stretching walls."

"8430500","8431700"," I got you covered, brother."
"8432020","8433700"," Look at all that added benefit, man. "
"8435260","8439880"," I think stretching walls was like, I think I could be wrong in this way."
"8439920","8443580"," I think stretching walls was like, no, dude, you don't have to make me a moderator."
"8443580","8449580"," And I left him on intentionally, I think, because of how pleasant he was. "
"8450380","8451960"," I feel like I should take a call here."
"8453040","8454100"," Hold on a second here."

"8910580","8913100"," Squeezing up right now, trying to trade the weekly trigger."
"8914600","8916440"," Smashing and bashing spoons."
"8917260","8918980"," What do we talk about earlier here?"
"8919100","8920100"," I'm going to show it to you again. "
"8920240","8920380"," Okay."
"8921560","8923380"," So pay attention right now."
"8925500","8927780"," You got this little bit right here. "
"8927880","8928100"," Okay."
"8936730","8939650"," What's your, what's your, um, what, or what?"
"8940570","8941450"," Trader podcast."
"8942030","8942250"," Okay. "
"8948700","8949580"," Trader podcast."
"8950040","8950220"," All right."
"8950220","8950660"," Hold on, brother. "
"8951960","8954040"," So I'm going to put you on just a second."
"8954120","8960120"," I got to talk to, uh, Members really quick."
"8960380","8962200"," So pay attention to this right here. "
"8962200","8962420"," Okay."
"8963360","8966300"," So watch this, uh, this dotted yellow line right here."
"8966300","8966560"," Okay. "
"8967600","8971680"," What we said was, what do you want to see here to take along, right?"
"8971880","8973900"," So you want to see the squeeze."
"8977070","8983300"," For the new high, right?"
"8984680","8986300"," Blast up higher here."
"8987500","8989100"," And then start making. "
"8989760","8991280"," A run for."
"8993960","8997720"," Make that white and make the three."
"8998940","9000720"," So watch this really close right here. "
"9000900","9004240"," So you don't need to get, you don't need to be up here."
"9004260","9005280"," There's no requirements."
"9005880","9009480"," The only requirement is that you get that little bit, like a little computer. "
"9009800","9011420"," There's a little computer program out there."
"9012240","9013580"," There's tiny little computer out there."
"9013940","9014720"," And this, I'm serious. "
"9015080","9016340"," There's like a little algorithm out there."
"9016480","9019720"," It just wants that little bit of high."
"9021040","9025080"," Comes back down, consolidates, confirms to the upside on your trigger. "
"9027580","9028780"," Now, can it go higher?"
"9029060","9030640"," It can, it can blast all the way up here."
"9030800","9031640"," It can blast up here."
"9032160","9032740"," Straight up there. "
"9032860","9033520"," It can go right here."
"9034140","9035960"," Come back down and retest over here."
"9037040","9038680"," Right off the white line comes up higher. "
"9038880","9039480"," That can all happen."
"9039700","9043880"," But what you're looking for is fundamentally or technically what you're looking for."
"9043920","9044860"," I should be more exacting. "
"9045420","9047060"," Technically what you're looking for is that break."
"9047620","9050840"," You're looking for this, this, this right here, this previous eye right here."
"9051720","9053080"," Is important to you. "
"9054320","9058160"," Okay, so we'll turn this to the side right over there."
"9060140","9061720"," Make this yellow, I guess."
"9061960","9064400"," That's what we've been doing the yellow thing. "
"9064680","9066060"," What you don't want to see is what?"
"9068020","9069740"," You know what you don't want to see?"
"9070100","9072780"," You don't want to see the failure to make a new high."
"9073000","9074280"," That would be something like this."
"9078570","9078970"," Right?"
"9079330","9080530"," You fail to make a new high. "
"9080790","9084790"," You will test that five minute and you don't want to see this, do you?"
"9088470","9089870"," So we'll make that red."
"9091490","9092930"," You don't want to see that, right?"
"9093110","9094090"," You don't want to see that failure."
"9095950","9097530"," No failure to make a new high. "
"9097710","9098530"," You need the new high."
"9099650","9100670"," That's right there."
"9106570","9107310"," Trainer podcast. "
"9107910","9111290"," If I give you access, are you going to do some cool on Twitter?"
"9112970","9114150"," I hope that you would."
"9114570","9116090"," Because I really like your Twitter handle, man."
"9116090","9118410"," I think the shit that you put on Twitter is fucking baller. "
"9119450","9122190"," And I like your, I want you to know something, man."
"9123190","9129230"," I have always appreciated good content on social media."
"9129730","9133570"," And I want you to know specifically that I appreciate your content. "
"9134250","9138990"," What you put out on different social media platforms."
"9139490","9140990"," I enjoy your content, man."
"9141110","9142810"," So I got your brother. "
"9177340","9179140"," And let me ask you another question."
"9179300","9180000"," Trader podcast."
"9181300","9182080"," Do you. "
"9184420","9186080"," Oh, there he is right there."
"9186080","9186460"," I got him."
"9186600","9187580"," I got him done. "
"9188400","9189320"," Found him."
"9191140","9192100"," Trader podcast."
"9193080","9194160"," We should chat sometime. "
"9195520","9198060"," I'm fascinated to find out what that podcast means."
"9201340","9204360"," We have, we have room available."
"9204660","9205780"," We need people right now. "
"9206480","9209120"," So if you are ever looking for a home."
"9210180","9215200"," If you ever looking for a place to call home, let me know, man."
"9216300","9217220"," So there you go. "
"9217520","9217880"," I got you."
"9218140","9218680"," I got you."
"9218820","9221200"," And there's no requirement for you to be. "
"9224240","9226400"," Hanging with us more than you want to either."
"9226400","9227820"," So I can respect that too."
"9228600","9233980"," If you just want that a place to go that you're just like quiet and I understand that too. "
"9233980","9235820"," Like you want a place you can go and nobody fucks with you."
"9236440","9237000"," That's fine."
"9237140","9237660"," But if you ever do. "
"9239140","9241740"," Seeing that podcast stuff in your username."

"10775650","10785630"," this to act as momentum to the upside slide that over a"
"10785630","10801310"," little bit more so you can see it I see"
"10801310","10811220"," you brother yeah I got pick up 432s for 10 cents there are seven cents right now eight cents"
"10811220","10820960"," so 432s dirt cheap dirt dirt dirt dirt cheap dirty dirty dirty cheap calls"
"10820960","10827200"," right now dirty cheap calls dealers saying this ain't happening"
"10827200","10837370"," they're saying"
"10837370","10846030"," yeah Chase that's true man chase that squeeze higher you are correct chase that that squeeze higher"
"10846030","10852470"," in that rejection off daily trigger would be the crash that you're looking for you're looking for"
"10852470","10859710"," like that major squeeze major rejection on daily trigger and that daily trigger just collapse down"
"10859710","10866990"," through that weekly trigger brother you are correct that's what you're looking for it the sign of"
"10866990","10874270"," that happening would be like a major squeeze higher too we should be relentless for like two three"
"10874270","10882490"," days like straight up and then bam reject when you just reject that daily trigger we come crashing"
"10882490","10889250"," down the bulls don't believe we can trade higher they don't place bets for higher than that for"
"10889250","10899030"," 434 434 41 somewhere in there I agree Chase I'm not"
"10899030","10907870"," disagreeing with you brother I don't think the 440 though is where the crash is though like the 440"
"10907870","10912470"," to 450 I don't think where that's where the crash is I think the crashes on the daily trigger 434"
"10912470","10919970"," I think 434 there's if we get violent reversal there would not shock me if we're gonna have a crash"
"10919970","10929890"," it's likely at that 434 it's not at 444 50 I don't think"
"10929890","10936230"," it's that high I think it's lower let me see if we can show it right now it's pretty easy"
"10936230","10947200"," to show right"
"10947200","10955120"," here bro the other saying no way and you got it right here you squeeze up and you just sell"
"10955120","10959460"," right down you can see it right there we go back to the trigger screen you can see it right"
"10959460","10968100"," there right squeeze up straight back down straight up to the daily trigger straight back down so we"
"10968100","10973060"," got the weekly trigger right here right we got the weekly trigger where we sold before right came"
"10973060","10978920"," back up didn't hold the weekly trigger straight to the depths of hell right we go up we have to"
"10978920","10983680"," hold the daily trigger right have to Hold it, gotta get up, gotta hold this one and start hitting"
"10983680","10983880"," hard."
"10984660","10990620"," So if we don't do this, and we don't do this, then what happens?"
"10990880","10991420"," We know, right?"
"10992060","10994780"," I can show it to you right here, show exactly what happens if this doesn't hold."
"10995600","10997960"," Squeeze up, no holding, no consolidation. "
"10999020","11000000"," We sold right underneath."
"11000560","11003080"," We rejected that weekly trigger, boom to the downside."
"11004300","11005820"," So what are bears looking for right now?"
"11006940","11008400"," They're looking for rejection here, right?"
"11008400","11013240"," They need rejection to get some blood going. "
"11013940","11017380"," They need rejection up here to get some real blood going to the downside."
"11019080","11023760"," So until we get that rejection on the weekly trigger, until we get that rejection on the daily"
"11023760","11028040"," trigger, we're waiting C mode if you're a bear."
"11029580","11036240"," If you're a bear, you hate 4.937 and you hate 434 to 41. "
"11036240","11041800"," Now what happens if we do hold, right?"
"11042600","11048480"," If we do hold, and this is where Chase is saying 4400, right?"
"11049040","11052220"," If we do hold that, we squeeze higher, right?"
"11053640","11062740"," There's your 444, and what you're really looking for if your bull is that rejection, and"
"11062740","11072420"," you're looking for the hold, like there's the yellow line right there, right?"
"11072560","11079980"," So you get price comes down, and if it holds, right, that's not a good sign for bears, is it?"
"11080020","11086200"," If you were a seller over here and you see this, you see a brief new high, and then you"
"11086200","11090920"," see this hold right here, this seller over here is gonna panic."
"11090920","11096400"," So this will start squeezing higher again, and then you're gonna squeeze out all of these bears,"
"11096760","11101020"," and you're gonna start pressuring that 450 and higher."
"11104160","11108360"," Tim's saying, so right now, whoop, dealer's saying no way. "
"11109280","11115840"," So right now we're just watching, and we wanna see this weekly trigger hold."
"11117260","11125540"," We want this weekly trigger to hold, and we want, or bulls want to get above the daily trigger,"
"11125740","11128760"," that's their next mission, right?"
"11129000","11134100"," The next mission is to hold this and start going higher."
"11136040","11142020"," If they don't, and we begin to roll to the downside, start rolling this over, get underneath the"
"11142020","11148200"," five minute, get the one minute, over the five minute, get price below, and we'll start heading to"
"11148200","11148460"," the downside. "
"11151530","11152970"," Right now, not much going on."
"11154830","11157230"," Not much going on."
"11159410","11162690"," I'll tell you right now, if you're a seller, you're just drooling on this. "
"11162890","11169490"," If you're like a seller, you're probably like, oh dude, just give me like a big red bar to the"
"11169490","11170690"," depth of hell right there."
"11171210","11172070"," Just a bloodbath."
"11173070","11174490"," A liquidation break, bro. "
"11175630","11177350"," Squeezes back up just a little bit, right?"
"11178190","11179150"," No more will by bulls."
"11179150","11182070"," Starts raining it down over here."
"11182410","11185170"," Bulls come back up over here thinking they got something. "
"11185630","11189310"," And bammo, right there, we send the bulls to the depths of hell."
"11191290","11193250"," That's how fucking seller thinks."
"11197470","11199170"," That's how a seller thinks. "
"11206630","11210650"," You know, I'm telling you that I'm going to sell you right now."
"11210870","11212350"," Spock Emmon isn't the fuck they're talking about."
"11212410","11212790"," How about that?"
"11213650","11216110"," So Spock Emmon isn't what the fuck they're talking about. "
"11216370","11222410"," And not only that, we're going to trade if, or if we trade that 4,400, that 43, we actually"
"11222410","11223350"," will reject it."
"11223830","11227470"," And we have to confirm on that daily trigger, then we can go higher than that."
"11227990","11231090"," So, or maybe I should say, I shouldn't say that Spock Emmon isn't what they're talking about. "
"11231270","11233750"," How about I say, I won't say that."
"11233950","11235090"," I apologize for saying that."
"11236710","11240810"," They need a successful retest of the 21 EMA or the 27 EMA in a daily chart. "
"11241550","11242530"," And then you'll go higher."
"11243350","11247110"," And there's definitely no confirmation of a crash at 4,400 either."
"11247830","11252670"," If at any point that daily trigger gets picked up on a rejection of 4,400, we will fucking go"
"11252670","11252910"," higher. "
"11253270","11253610"," I guarantee it."
"11254050","11256350"," And they will be fucking wrong once again, usually."
"11258890","11259890"," Sorry about that. "
"11260090","11260510"," I apologize."
"11260630","11262110"," I shouldn't disparage Spock Emmon."
"11262330","11262910"," I'm sorry. "
"11263090","11263270"," Truly."
"11266030","11268550"," Blank Pinky delete this part of the broadcast."
"11270130","11271890"," Delete this part of the broadcast, bro. "
"11279550","11280110"," Yeah."
"11280490","11280530"," There."
"11282330","11285650"," We get above that 4, 34, and we hold it. "
"11285950","11287190"," We're going to 4, 40."
"11287190","11287950"," 4, 44."
"11289350","11290770"," We'll reject likely. "
"11291810","11296250"," And then we're going to retest that 21 EMA on a daily basis."
"11296830","11300690"," If that shit holds, and you're a seller up there at 4, 44, run."
"11301990","11302490"," Run. "
"11303010","11303370"," Pack it up."
"11304510","11305230"," I assure you."
"11306210","11307110"," A hundred percent. "
"11311630","11313090"," Yeah, that's true too big balls."
"11313890","11314790"," That's true too."
"11320950","11321270"," Yeah. "
"11321730","11325230"," Well, you know what you wanted to hear."
"11325490","11325810"," Hold on here."
"11326770","11327690"," I got something for you, Chase. "
"11330290","11331950"," So, like, Chase, what you want."
"11332690","11334130"," Let's talk about what you want, man."
"11338130","11339710"," Let's see if we can go over there and look at it right now. "
"11342090","11352250"," So, Chase, what you want is what you want, Chase, if you, if you, Chase, if you're looking for, oh,"
"11352810","11353190"," yeah, baby."
"11354070","11362210"," So, Chase, if you're looking for that bloodbath, right, you need, you need, like, down below this,"
"11362210","11364310"," this collar, right?"
"11364550","11364770"," The strike."
"11366010","11366390"," Like, early. "
"11367210","11368230"," You need it early, man."
"11368230","11369630"," You, like, need it right now."
"11369810","11375050"," You need to get under here right now and, like, start heading down. "
"11375570","11377630"," You have examples of this, of doing this too."
"11377950","11379590"," Like, I can show you an example right here."
"11380650","11384030"," As a prime example, you need this one right here. "
"11384270","11384750"," This is what you need."
"11385710","11390150"," Week, week, slam down underneath, slam down there, slam down."
"11390990","11391390"," Fuck you. "
"11391630","11392910"," This is what you're looking for right here."
"11393670","11394070"," You're a seller."
"11395130","11396350"," Right there is what you're looking for. "
"11396970","11399530"," You're looking for the weakness, the rejection, the downside move."
"11399730","11404410"," If you don't get that right, if you don't get that in the beginning of the quarter, you're likely"
"11404410","11405670"," not going to get it, are you?"
"11406110","11407390"," Like, you see this right here?"
"11408730","11409510"," You see it?"
"11411070","11417050"," If you start trading this up here, start trading this up."
"11417190","11418270"," We're going to be, like, a magnet, right?"
"11418790","11419410"," Trade that shit. "
"11419930","11423970"," Even if we reject to the downside, it's still not the move that you're looking for."
"11423970","11428490"," And don't forget, in December 31st, right?"
"11429250","11437290"," If we go up into, like, if we go up here, and they start telling you there's no Christmas rally,"
"11437830","11441950"," and then all of a sudden, the last two weeks, they just ramped that shit, right?"
"11442130","11448070"," The last two weeks of the year, window dressing, end of quarter, you're going to get a hurtin'"
"11448190","11448250"," right?"
"11450630","11452610"," Like, you get some kind of a hurtin' down here."
"11454430","11458800"," So, be careful of that, Chase. "
"11461660","11463280"," Be really careful of that."
"11467470","11469850"," You need Chase, you need, like, rejection, bro."
"11470670","11472210"," Watch that big green bar right there. "
"11472930","11477710"," Like, you need, you need, like, fuck you red bar down, we're going down there."
"11478890","11481950"," You need a big fuck you at 430 and 434."
"11482410","11485510"," You don't get that big fuck you, man, and you know where we're going, dude. "
"11485630","11486110"," We're going up."
"11486970","11488230"," We're going up, brother."
"11492070","11493710"," You already know where we're going, man. "
"11508590","11518230"," You need a big, big, big, big cell on 43431 and 42948."
"11518990","11519930"," Like, you need it."
"11520590","11521590"," You must have it. "
"11522090","11522810"," Like, you got it."
"11522890","11523510"," You better have it."
"11523670","11524450"," Like, you need it, dog. "
"11524910","11525170"," Trust me."
"11525310","11525690"," You need it."
"11526130","11526950"," You need, like, rejection. "
"11527890","11528650"," Like, fuck you."
"11533020","11534520"," So, SG is not saying crash."
"11534780","11534980"," Okay. "
"11535400","11541160"," I agree with, um, if SG is saying that, uh, we haven't hit our low and spy, I would not"
"11541160","11541960"," disagree with that."
"11542600","11545120"," Uh, I would, I would not disagree with that statement."
"11545440","11547780"," So, SG is saying, um, just continued weakness. "
"11548440","11553680"," For the next five sessions, let's say eight sessions, I would not disagree with that."
"11554440","11558260"," Um, or there's a potential for at least one more new low and spy."
"11558260","11560380"," I wouldn't disagree with that. "
"11560680","11563300"," If you look at, um, let's take another look around."
"11563440","11564740"," Then let's take another look at something else."
"11565200","11565700"," Let's see. "
"11565700","11566640"," It's two cool things."
"11567080","11568140"," Let's do some cool stuff."
"11568560","11569780"," Let's have some fucking fun. "
"11570680","11572020"," Um, hold on a second here."
"11573920","11575720"," Let's have some, let's have some fun."
"11577920","11578880"," Uh, cycles. "
"11579760","11582400"," Let's look at cycles first."
"11582960","11590240"," Uh, and then, and this is where this is where you get into the trigger screen screen."
"11590860","11594540"," This is where you get into, um, some important stuff. "
"11594760","11597100"," Dan Niles will likely come out."
"11597160","11599340"," I'm going to, I'm going to make some, I'm going to make some projections."
"11600420","11603480"," Dan Niles likely comes out on CNBC today. "
"11604340","11608640"," And he tells you that though he believes in a market crash, he is now long."
"11609320","11610720"," Due to oversold conditions."
"11611580","11613240"," Uh, he will be long here. "
"11614260","11614740"," Okay."
"11615440","11619240"," Um, another thing that you need to see here is that."
"11620200","11624170"," Uh, we're at 12% bullish. "
"11625030","11632850"," Uh, 12.58. Uh, the total is 13.5. We were down to 5.6, I think last week, right?"
"11633090","11633770"," Or earlier this week."
"11634490","11635590"," I think we traded for 18."
"11635930","11640650"," We brought up this chart on stream and said, Hey, look at how low we are right now. "
"11640650","11643650"," I think we're at 5.6 or something like that."
"11644090","11646490"," Uh, you had energy stocks that were trashed."
"11647110","11651850"," You had, um, energy stocks were near zero. "
"11652330","11655590"," You had, uh, utilities were at zero."
"11656310","11659310"," Uh, consumer defensive, I think was that zero."
"11660110","11662970"," Uh, so a bunch like the XLU stuff was at zero. "
"11663770","11668230"," Uh, energy, it wasn't energy itself like WTI or Brent."
"11668230","11671690"," It was like the companies that build the infrastructure and all that kind of stuff."
"11672210","11676330"," But, uh, you have like, like four that were at quite zero and a bunch of others that were really"
"11676330","11676630"," low. "
"11677090","11680650"," So when we're down here, like this, it's like, are you buying a fucking dip?"
"11680910","11682410"," Are you buying a fucking dip here?"
"11683010","11683150"," No."
"11683850","11685470"," Are you buying a fucking dip there?"
"11685710","11685830"," No."
"11686890","11688330"," Are you buying a fucking dip there?"
"11688490","11688570"," No. "
"11688930","11690210"," Are you buying a dip down here?"
"11690370","11690550"," Yes."
"11690850","11691910"," Are you buying a dip down there?"
"11692070","11692250"," Yes."
"11698230","11700670"," buying a dip down there, fuck yes you are. "
"11701230","11703170"," Now if it turns on you, it turns on you."
"11703590","11706170"," But this is where you put risk on as a bull."
"11706650","11709150"," This is where you take risk off as a bull. "
"11709730","11714750"," So you can see right now that they are buying this crap down here."
"11715050","11719750"," And on PPOs, you're seeing the turn."
"11720290","11722390"," Watch PPOs right now, you see that?"
"11722590","11726290"," You see that green line crossing that purple line. "
"11726630","11728410"," We talked about this one yesterday."
"11729470","11734450"," We said that PPOs are giving a forward projection of this being the bottom, right?"
"11734970","11740090"," We said that PMOs were not, and we have further proof of that today."
"11740650","11742930"," Now, we're not out of the woods yet, are we?"
"11743270","11745390"," PMOs have not crossed yet. "
"11745750","11749630"," We have a turn of the blue, but not across above the red."
"11750130","11751270"," So we're not there yet."
"11751310","11755190"," If you're a bull, you need to see price go above 434. "
"11755870","11758470"," And confirm that move higher."
"11758910","11763970"," Now for cycles and market breadth, they are telling you to buy this."
"11764430","11766410"," They're telling you, this is your dip buy. "
"11766890","11769530"," You should buy it, time to go."
"11770030","11775570"," You have not seen a rejection today or yesterday below this trend, have you?"
"11775990","11781610"," You have not seen a rejection here below this trend yet to say crash, have you?"
"11781970","11786870"," So you buy this dip, you put the risk on for this next leg to the upside."
"11788610","11793830"," Next thing we should look at would be, what's the next thing that we should look at?"
"11793910","11796250"," We looked at the, we looked at the cycles. "
"11797830","11799210"," We looked at gamma yesterday."
"11800130","11800950"," We looked at the collar."
"11802250","11804110"," What else do we got to show you here today?"
"11804350","11809770"," We've already been over the PE ratios, all the macro you need, the MBI, the gamma. "
"11810410","11816870"," So for right now, for right now, I haven't showed you the algorithm yet today, but for right now,"
"11817090","11825330"," before right now, it's a situation is improving for the bulls."
"11826090","11830270"," Situation improving, this is what a bull wants to see for a turnaround."
"11836190","11844690"," So some other, some other positive improvements for the bulls, but even so, PPO is not giving the"
"11844690","11845950"," go ahead. "
"11846530","11853550"," PPO is not yet saying, not yet saying, trust this dip buy."
"11853970","11855930"," So they have more work to do, bulls got work."
"11866360","11868920"," Yeah, it was down to like a bearishness. "
"11869180","11872740"," So it's not bearishness, it's bullishness, sector bullishness."
"11873540","11880340"," When we get, when we get down below 21, right, we have a liquidation phase that we become exposed"
"11880340","11880960"," to."
"11881000","11886580"," And then once we get down to about 11 or 12, we start liquidating. "
"11887660","11893200"," And as a matter of fact, XLRE this morning was still liquidating, right?"
"11893480","11896180"," Did you see XLRE was still liquidating this morning?"
"11896960","11906820"," So you could still see in the market breadth, you could still see a few sectors that continue to"
"11906820","11914680"," get liquidated in the coming days, like next five sessions, so that you can get a nice good price"
"11914680","11917380"," down lower for the market to go higher."
"11917700","11921940"," So there's a little bit of that mechanic in the background that you have to pay attention to as"
"11921940","11922140"," well."
"11923420","11928100"," But it looks like they're buying these weak sectors right now. "
"11928560","11930720"," Like it looks like rotation is going on."
"11931060","11931980"," It looks like it."
"11932480","11938100"," So could a sector bloodbath still on Monday without the S&P bloodbath thing?"
"11938100","11938500"," Yes. "
"11940000","11945560"," Can NASDAQ go higher, even if S&P rolls down on Monday briefly?"
"11946320","11946540"," Yes."
"11947400","11951640"," So, and we're looking for spec growth and protect to go higher before spy."
"11952540","11959760"," So it would not shock me and it would be an indicator to you if you see maybe spy still"
"11959760","11960680"," consolidating. "
"11961400","11967520"," So if you see a simple way to say this would be, if you see like a level on spy"
"11967520","11970700"," that you can keep buying the dip on, right?"
"11970860","11971520"," You're buying this."
"11972380","11973580"," You're buying this."
"11974000","11978840"," And spy is just kind of doing this action here while you're buying. "
"11979940","11986880"," But you see this happening and you watch tech start taking off before spy does."
"11987580","11989560"," So tech just starts ramping."
"11989560","11993940"," And then of course, spy follows later, okay?"
"11994100","12000480"," So you have like an early ramp on spec growth and then you would have spy catch up in five"
"12000480","12001260"," or 10 sessions. "
"12001920","12003520"," So keep your eyes on that."
"12003920","12006620"," Like, so watch NASDAQ today, watch spec growth today."
"12007420","12013640"," Keep your eyes on those speculative and those risk on appetite stocks. "
"12014660","12021500"," Even if spy doesn't follow, it will follow if tech is doing that, which it is, right?"
"12021620","12022740"," We already know that that's already going on."
"12023700","12025060"," Kind of setting you up there."
"12028890","12034530"," Spy still trying to trade R3 at 430, 40. "
"12037470","12039770"," See if spoons can get up there right now."
"12043230","12044270"," 432 C's."
"12045730","12047730"," I like those calls the best. "
"12050050","12054090"," Well, I like them because there's a little, like I like them mostly because it's kind of like right"
"12054090","12054330"," there."
"12054350","12055090"," It's like right in the middle."
"12056030","12057670"," So that's like, yeah, we get up there. "
"12057730","12063530"," Maybe we squeeze and fail, you know, like a little bit extra, but it's not quite that much up"
"12063530","12063850"," there."
"12064390","12069070"," If we go up there and do the little wiggle waggle up to the up there before the close today."
"12070550","12072770"," If the algo is no, we need to go up there. "
"12130240","12130600"," Okay."
"12134720","12135860"," Any particular ETF?"
"12136240","12141480"," So what I do is I have a list of tickers that I watch closely, suspected growth stocks."
"12142280","12146520"," And if those are printing, if they're getting bought, if they're going up, even though the market's"
"12146520","12148640"," at the bottom, keep an eye on those. "
"12148880","12151240"," So we have a stock scanner that I use."
"12152080","12155480"," You guys are gonna get access to it like on your own."
"12155600","12158660"," You're gonna just be able to go to it every day and check it out. "
"12160300","12165480"," If we're at a bottom and I'm not seeing any tickers pop up on that thing, then I'm scared."
"12166060","12169600"," If I see tickers pop up on that thing, I'm not scared."
"12170040","12172120"," And there are tickers popping up on it right now. "
"12172940","12174160"," Do you want to know what those tickers are?"
"12175660","12177940"," Hold on here, I'll pull some up for you."
"12180380","12180820"," Ready?"
"12182000","12183000"," You're not gonna be shocked here."
"12183000","12193020"," Right now, Duolingo, BRZE, that's braise, S, which is Sentinel-1, and GWH, ESS"
"12193020","12194440"," Tech Incorporated. "
"12195120","12198920"," For right now at this moment, those are the four that I'm watching."
"12205090","12206770"," Oh, I gotta do something here."
"12206950","12207530"," Hold on a second here. "
"12207950","12210490"," I gotta, god damn it, I never do this shit."
"12212070","12213710"," So I don't ask for tips."
"12214110","12215950"," I guess sometimes I do, but not often. "
"12216270","12220150"," So I'm gonna say a thank you to anybody that tipped this past week."
"12220710","12226010"," So, cause they don't cut, it doesn't come through on streamlabs if you tip me."
"12226170","12226950"," So hold on a second here. "
"12230170","12231170"," Let me see who tipped."
"12232270","12232950"," Only a quick second."
"12236690","12237570"," Let's check. "
"12237570","12237810"," Check."

"12252810","12256630"," I don't, I think that's a refund or something, but I'm not sure. "

"12767210","12768970"," Matter of fact, this is where your mind is."
"12768990","12773670"," I mean, this looks like it right here because you got like the squeeze hire, come back, Daily"
"12773670","12774610"," Trigger helped you out. "
"12774890","12777010"," As soon as you got that bounce right there, you're fucked."
"12777470","12779010"," You're like, totally fucked as a seller."
"12779470","12781450"," I think this was the one danger zone we had. "
"12781530","12783570"," We had the cross below and the Daily Trigger on the weekly."
"12784090","12786650"," You got price crossing below the monthly."
"12786650","12793090"," All of this here is, without seeing any of this right here, without seeing any of this right here,"
"12793170","12794950"," this is pretty sketchy right here. "
"12795490","12800890"," You got price below monthly, daily coming down, weekly coming down, all looking like bloodbath to"
"12800890","12801170"," the downside."
"12802410","12806230"," That was some wild, I don't know if you remember that, but I thought that was some wild-ass shit."
"12810110","12812510"," Personally, I found that to be some wild-ass trading. "
"12816850","12820150"," Spooze trying to squeeze hire right now, trying to trade R3."
"12821930","12823610"," Do we do the creepy crawly at the wall?"
"12823810","12824170"," No idea."
"12825990","12828910"," They're saying no, that we're not going to squeeze up there. "
"12829130","12830670"," They're telling you that R3 is top."
"12831350","12833770"," Telling you you're not going to go up here into the close."
"12835670","12838910"," Do you think we squeeze up over the weekend up here?"
"12839070","12841410"," Do you think it's just a trap for bulls for a crash on a Monday?"
"12841930","12843130"," Black, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, and a Monday crash. "
"12848150","12856750"," So those tickers I called out aren't trash, so I'm not calling out, so we need to differentiate so"
"12856750","12860850"," those companies that I gave to you are not trash companies."
"12861630","12863270"," Those companies are fucking baller."
"12863370","12866530"," You look at those companies up and you look at the past two, three years, they're bangers. "
"12867570","12871490"," Those are what I use, they have fundamental reasons to go higher."
"12872890","12881330"," But if you're, if I was, if it was my fault, like let's say maybe I was mixing in Palantir"
"12881330","12888150"," and Roblox with those companies, I'm trying to, those are separate, but I do like Roblox and"
"12888150","12888830"," Palantir."
"12888970","12890410"," I don't think they're scam companies. "
"12891960","12897570"," I just don't think they have the, I don't think Palantir specifically has the, well they've got"
"12897570","12904350"," shared dilution issues and then they've got, they don't have a fucking phone for people to hold."
"12905510","12909830"," That's their other big problem, is that they don't have, like no one knows who they are."
"12910050","12911790"," You know who they are, I know who they are. "
"12912790","12913830"," You guys ready for a squeeze?"
"12915870","12919650"," But like Bob on Main Street doesn't know who Palantir is."
"12920010","12920890"," He care less."
"12922790","12923770"," We ready for a squeeze?"
"12928120","12928840"," Trading 430. "
"12930840","12932460"," Oh, six right now."
"12933440","12936020"," Let's see if we can snag this big move to the upside."
"12936340","12938020"," Let's see if we can grab that R3. "
"12941490","12944610"," Spy, looks like it wants to squeeze here."
"12944690","12949630"," If you're watching book map right now, it's hungry to fill all that supply on a pie."
"12961150","12962550"," Howling's about ready in the basement?"
"12965210","12966750"," Squeeze the juice, doggy. "
"12973980","12975520"," Oh, I'm in some calls right now."
"12975580","12976240"," I'm in some zero dates."
"12976840","12979420"," I got a small 50. "
"12979820","12981800"," I've got some, I've got some zero dates for 432."
"12983720","12985800"," I think we grind up there, or not grind."
"12986160","12988680"," I'm like, I'm like Vlogo gambling right now. "
"12989060","12992580"," So it's Friday."
"12995320","12996800"," It's a fucking Friday right now."
"12997160","12997780"," Life is good. "
"13001660","13002840"," Do you guys want some music?"
"13005100","13006620"," Do you want some of that music, don't you?"
"13009980","13011920"," Trading 430.06 right here."
"13013020","13015620"," This reminds me of like the creepy crawly, doesn't it?"
"13015800","13018960"," They just grind it sideways into 330, and then they make that move higher."
"13020140","13023100"," Try to kill all those options as they move price where they want it. "
"13024540","13026020"," Does remind me of that."
"13026280","13030320"," It reminds me of like murder all the options, and then put price where we need it."
"13032220","13033480"," That's what it reminds me of. "
"13039290","13040310"," Let's see right now."
"13043370","13044790"," Squeeze the juice box, baby."
"13050790","13052230"," Gamma pin setting up on spy. "
"13052450","13052730"," Let me look."
"13053190","13054110"," I'll look right now for it."
"13054170","13054370"," Hold on. "
"13061120","13062280"," Hold on one second."
"13062500","13063500"," Let me check the gamma stuff."
"13070650","13071770"," Okay, what do we got here?"
"13073210","13074770"," SPX net gamma. "
"13078170","13079070"," 4-1."
"13081470","13084770"," 4-1-3-2 maybe, 4-1-3-1."
"13086810","13087990"," Somewhere in there. "
"13088290","13088510"," Hold on."
"13089070","13090710"," You want to talk about the gamma?"
"13090910","13091570"," Hold on a second here."
"13092790","13094750"," You know there was a..."
"13094750","13096830"," There was a..."
"13096830","13098750"," The market was unhedged at the beginning. "
"13098750","13100010"," I told you to talk about that, right?"
"13100690","13104670"," That the market was unhedged, and then so many fucking people bought puts."
"13106770","13108870"," You guys drank the fucking Kool-Aid."
"13110550","13113030"," And you guys all drank the fucking Kool-Aid. "
"13113970","13118950"," So, SPX is trading 4-3-1-3 right now."
"13121370","13123130"," The SPX net gamma."
"13125690","13130990"," In real time is 4-3-1-0. "
"13131510","13132350"," That's the..."
"13132790","13135350"," That's how they murder the most options is right there."
"13136490","13137950"," Let me look at some other stuff."
"13138710","13140090"," Let me check OI real quick, quick. "
"13141910","13143610"," Still got all that fucking..."
"13143610","13145890"," All that protection is loaded the fuck up."
"13149290","13150690"," All OI change."
"13151850","13154070"," You guys are buying fucking Kalls, huh?"
"13154570","13156230"," You guys are buying goddamn Kalls. "
"13157450","13158150"," Oh yeah."
"13159490","13161250"," You guys are buying Kalls right now."
"13163410","13164730"," Oh yeah, you guys are fucking..."
"13164730","13166270"," You guys are fucking loading up. "
"13167290","13169390"," Oh, you guys are buying the fuck out of this."
"13170550","13172650"," You guys are buying 430 C's."
"13175670","13178150"," You guys are loading the fuck up on Kalls right now. "
"13182090","13183870"," Let me look at vol-control and volatility."
"13184290","13185090"," Let me look at this one."
"13186030","13186650"," Gamma flip set. "
"13187030","13188210"," Where's the gamma flip at?"
"13191750","13192430"," Hold on one second."
"13192570","13192990"," I got to do something."
"13193970","13194790"," Do one quick second here. "
"13199020","13200720"," We got to export some levels."
"13202180","13203460"," I got to do something here in the background."
"13205740","13207480"," I got to check where the gamma flip is. "
"13215390","13216650"," Where is the gamma flip?"
"13216830","13218710"," I don't have it in front of me right now."
"13220690","13221910"," Gamma, that's a good gamma."
"13235000","13236240"," Let's check the gamma picture. "
"13238640","13240100"," Let's see what we got going on here."
"13247870","13251120"," This isn't loading for me right now."
"13261750","13263630"," I got bad numbers today. "
"13265150","13266530"," Looks like it's giving me bad numbers."
"13273230","13274950"," Looks like I got bad numbers today."
"13278310","13279230"," A lot of second here. "
"13279390","13280910"," I got to input all this stuff one more time."
"13293170","13295010"," Let me check a 30 minute chart."
"13298530","13299690"," Check a one minute chart. "
"13308410","13309210"," Here we go."
"13309290","13309790"," I got them good."
"13313110","13317690"," Here, gamma flip is 4400. "
"13318450","13319730"," I agree with that statement."
"13322890","13324990"," Let me share this with you guys."
"13328110","13330450"," Grinding higher now, trading R3. "
"13331170","13332430"," Trading 430-47."
"13334530","13337050"," Let me bring something over for you here."
"13339990","13341230"," Let me see. "
"13341790","13342430"," Hold on here."
"13344790","13347070"," We will pull chart."
"13348070","13349250"," Something like that. "
"13349450","13349810"," Does that work?"
"13354610","13355250"," Camera."
"13356650","13357570"," Webcam frame."
"13358730","13360910"," This right here is your gamma profile. "
"13360910","13361830"," This is your first file game of picture."
"13363850","13366150"," You're like a buyer here."
"13366490","13367010"," See that?"
"13367270","13368150"," 42 million. "
"13368690","13370990"," Price target to the upside for buyers."
"13372570","13375790"," 43.50.54 in SPX."
"13378110","13381070"," There's some kind of an expectation here. "
"13388230","13391790"," You got a note up here at 4400."
"13392750","13395970"," So there's some kind of an expectation here of trading."
"13397490","13399250"," We're above or green right now. "
"13399430","13400630"," We should trade that at least."
"13402750","13404630"," We need though to get up here."
"13409510","13412390"," I guess that's what Chase is saying down there. "
"13413490","13413830"," So."
"13416850","13421270"," And my, I think my point to chase here is to get that 63 million."
"13423090","13425370"," That's 4450, 4400. "
"13427230","13429370"," They're saying bloodbath above right here."
"13429550","13430290"," This is kind of their place."
"13430550","13432830"," But what I, my points to them right now was. "
"13433710","13437630"," If that blood rains down and it holds on the daily trigger."
"13438630","13439410"," Run out of it."
"13439410","13439890"," Get out of the way. "
"13439950","13440190"," Okay."
"13440510","13441730"," So like, like right there."
"13442370","13446850"," So if we squeeze up there and you're like, yeah, fuck you. "
"13446910","13447890"," I'm shorting the fuck out of this."
"13447890","13449890"," It turns around on you."
"13450690","13453690"," On that 4400 or 43 down there. "
"13454190","13455130"," Watch out."
"13455410","13456470"," So right now."
"13457050","13458630"," S P X into the close. "
"13459670","13461370"," Potential room to run."
"13462190","13463310"," The 4350."
"13463810","13465610"," Is it guaranteed that we go there right now?"
"13465690","13465870"," No. "
"13467170","13469310"," There's no guarantee that we go up there today."
"13470590","13472550"," But it wouldn't shock me."
"13472990","13475190"," It wouldn't shock me to see. "
"13476090","13477710"," This gets snuck up here."
"13477970","13478830"," See if it holds."
"13479670","13481970"," I wouldn't shock me to see it into Monday as well. "
"13483190","13483830"," It's possible."
"13484230","13485070"," It's definitely possible."
"13488050","13488830"," Is it probable?"
"13489710","13491210"," No, but is it there?"
"13491370","13491870"," Yeah, it is. "
"13494170","13495330"," Let's see if they can do it."
"13496730","13498810"," They only give me a couple pennies so far."
"13499050","13502290"," So for this squeezing so far, they have not paid me. "
"13502950","13504290"," Only up a couple pennies."
"13504410","13505010"," That doesn't mean shit."
"13505570","13507150"," I need us to squeeze higher. "
"13508670","13509570"," I need that."
"13509770","13511250"," I need this right here to happen."
"13511590","13512210"," I need to get this. "
"13512270","13513330"," I need to get this money here."
"13518580","13519660"," Squeezing higher now."
"13521880","13523880"," Now trading above our three. "
"13525040","13531860"," Trading 430.45. 430.47. Be careful of a squeeze out there to the upside."
"13533060","13536320"," Gam is saying that we can trade there into the close today."
"13536920","13537720"," So it is possible. "
"13538220","13543300"," It is possible that we can trade that 435, at least on SPX today."
"13552000","13554600"," Yeah, we're breaking through our three right now."
"13554840","13560900"," And if we hold it, if we hold our three, there is risk of a squeeze in the close here. "
"13561700","13565080"," There is squeeze risk all the way up into four."
"13565080","13569300"," They could do it between four and six p.m. They could do it over the weekend."
"13571680","13572500"," Into Monday. "
"13572840","13576780"," I don't know when they save it to squeeze there, but there's a chance of it happening."
"13582960","13587700"," What effect if any of this is China holiday this week ending Monday have?"
"13590280","13591540"," I don't know, man."
"13591640","13592080"," I'll make it up. "
"13592400","13594280"," I'm going to be honest with you guys."
"13594280","13601460"," Like the news, the economic calendar, the news, it doesn't really fucking matter."
"13601780","13605200"," It's like, it's like there. "
"13605440","13612320"," It's almost like they just pick some shit and say, oh, we're going down for these reasons."
"13612880","13612980"," Right?"
"13613260","13615960"," Then we go up and they give you a reason for why we're going up."
"13616120","13621280"," And it's like, man, they're just like, they just pick some shit, pick up on that shit and that's"
"13621280","13621400"," it. "
"13622200","13624980"," I have a real hard time with news right now."
"13625160","13626380"," It's really bothering me."
"13627680","13629500"," It's getting back on my nerves again. "
"13632360","13638220"," The discussion that we have this morning about when I was explaining to you about a bank owning the"
"13638220","13643780"," market and their motivations, what are their fucking motivations?"
"13644860","13646880"," Do they really care if the market goes higher?"
"13647380","13647380"," No."
"13648500","13653620"," You know, if they get that extra downside move, so fuck yeah, I make extra."
"13654200","13657820"," So like, it's like the motivations of these people that are telling you this stuff. "
"13658240","13659300"," Squeeze and I are right now."
"13659360","13659780"," Use."
"13661140","13661960"," I want you to use. "
"13663100","13669660"," I want to use these two supply zones up above on a book map up here."
"13669660","13676400"," Keep your eyes on this yellow and this red right here as we squeeze as potential tops."
"13677780","13679260"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"13679740","13683860"," Trade in 16 cents for a moment there in 432 C's."
"13684500","13686720"," Trade in 15 cents right now."
"13687200","13689020"," Spooze hanging dong out there. "
"13691300","13692820"," Spooze hanging dong."
"13694120","13695100"," Squeeze and higher."
"13695440","13697000"," Can it squeeze even higher?"
"13697940","13700940"," Trade in eight or nine cents just about 20 minutes ago. "
"13700940","13706860"," Now trading almost 100% higher on 432 C's."
"13712330","13714030"," Yes, it does surf X."
"13714390","13715130"," Yes, it does."
"13715910","13718190"," It does say that on my gamma profile. "
"13719230","13727330"," It does say at that four three three five on SPX that you'll trigger positive, positive flows."
"13728950","13729390"," Absolutely."
"13729690","13730570"," I agree with you on that brother. "

"13775390","13778450"," Like, do I just take the money and try to get back in an eight cents or something?"
"13780310","13781510"," Just stay in maybe."
"13783310","13784370"," Maybe I just stay in. "
"13785090","13786510"," I think I'm just going to stay in."

"14138670","14139230"," There you go. "
"14139370","14140490"," You're feeding off it right now."
"14140550","14140890"," There you go."
"14141090","14141610"," You get your fill. "
"14141790","14142770"," You got to pull back a little bit."
"14142990","14143850"," Relax for a little bit."
"14144010","14144650"," Yeah, you can do that. "
"14145190","14145590"," It's okay."
"14146990","14148930"," We got some more supply up there if we need it."
"14149270","14151170"," If you're still hungry, there's one more bar. "
"14151170","14152810"," There's actually more bars than that, too."
"14154430","14159970"," If you're that hungry price, we got more up there for you."
"14160070","14161070"," We got a bunch of supply up there. "
"14161590","14162370"," Keep on chugging."
"14163850","14166790"," He's going to pull back a little bit and then wipe his face off."
"14168570","14170110"," He's going to wipe the milk off his face. "
"14170970","14174490"," Sorry, I'm taking care of kitty cat babies right now, so everything is my life is around."
"14175410","14176830"," Shitting and pissing and drinking milk."
"14181530","14183430"," You got to do a little bit of pull back here. "
"14185650","14189340"," Oh, yeah."
"14189540","14190120"," Look at that up there."
"14190360","14191380"," Vauhala, baby. "
"14204540","14206800"," Bear milk is naturally super sweet."
"14208060","14209400"," We want it."
"14211980","14218240"," Bull's suckling off the teat of supply up on high on a Friday. "
"14220460","14221560"," The bears."
"14222220","14224500"," I bet you there are bears out there."
"14226140","14231260"," I bet you there are bears out there that went back and looked at the last three. "
"14232500","14234540"," Looked at the last three."
"14242290","14248350"," The last three non farm payrolls and said we got this shit on lock."
"14248350","14251690"," It said this. "
"14251850","14253270"," We got it three times."
"14253510","14255870"," The bulls have been raked over the coals."
"14257050","14261050"," We bloodbath for session after session after session. "
"14261690","14264650"," And bears walked in confident this morning."
"14265650","14270930"," That we would end today on that same note and have further."
"14272070","14275230"," Decline over session and session. "
"14276210","14278910"," Like not only are we going to bloodbath down."
"14279210","14281490"," We're going to bloodbath down before that for eighteen."
"14282170","14283370"," We're going to reject there. "
"14283510","14285790"," We're going to bleed into the bell on Friday."
"14285790","14288630"," And then next week you're getting five down sessions."
"14289810","14295690"," All because of non farm payroll that worked the last three times. "
"14296770","14297790"," And today."
"14299050","14300430"," That is not happening."
"14300430","14302450"," Today we are squeezing. "
"14303350","14304850"," We are ripping faces off."
"14305970","14308610"," We're looking for four thirty four into the bell."
"14309150","14312230"," I don't know if that'll happen, but it ain't pretty. "
"14313030","14316670"," Trying to trigger some short covering here into the clothes."
"14317170","14319090"," Can you imagine you're hanging out?"
"14319290","14321670"," You're like do, do you have anything spot on Friday?"
"14322110","14323330"," Bulls are going to get smoked."
"14323610","14324530"," It's going to be awesome sauce. "
"14326270","14328070"," Come back on Friday afternoon."
"14328070","14331530"," You're like what the fuck is going on?"
"14333690","14335790"," I got to close my shorts."
"14337530","14340530"," They're going to squeeze this shit up into the bell and be trapped. "
"14343070","14345610"," Can you imagine the panic setting in right now?"
"14346130","14346870"," And you're short."
"14347190","14348230"," You're like oh shit."
"14348350","14349510"," I want to wake up on Monday. "
"14350950","14352150"," Pacing all weekend."
"14352790","14355490"," You got bears trying to go on barbecues."
"14356430","14360910"," Like these bears are like these bears like we got this. "
"14361450","14369790"," Not only do we got this, but I've been so paranoid on this correction turning it into a clutch"
"14369790","14377510"," market crash that I made plans this weekend to go barbecuing with my fellow bear friends."
"14377910","14380230"," I don't have a lot of friends as a bear."
"14380230","14385510"," I tell these crazy conspiracy theories stories to my to my bull friends. "
"14385550","14386530"," They laugh at me."
"14389210","14397630"," So I feel confident now and I show up on Friday and now I can't have my barbecue with my"
"14397630","14398810"," bear friends over the weekend."
"14398810","14403470"," I got to get on into it and get my weekend Kool-Aid. "
"14404330","14405710"," My Kool-Aid on."
"14405930","14408230"," I got to drink the red Kool-Aid over the weekend."
"14411270","14413570"," I don't want to get squeezed out over the weekend. "
"14413570","14414850"," What are you doing to me?"
"14420340","14423740"," You got like bears all over fin to it canceling plans."
"14423920","14425460"," I'm going to write that right now."
"14639440","14640480"," Oh boy. "
"14644100","14645560"," Bear tears are sweet too."
"14682540","14683720"," Let's see what's going on."
"14683800","14684800"," How much more time we got here?"
"14685640","14687320"," We're going to do the creepy crawler at the wall or what?"
"14687500","14688280"," What's going on over here?"
"14688280","14688640"," What are we doing?"
"14690480","14692800"," We just retest and so we can go up higher again. "
"14693000","14693700"," What's this right here?"
"14693800","14694660"," What's going on over here?"
"14695420","14696500"," Let's keep an eyeball on this."
"14696780","14697660"," What are we doing here?"
"14698900","14700000"," Is it time to buy calls again?"
"14700320","14700620"," Hold on."
"14701420","14701980"," Let's check. "
"14702220","14702440"," Hold on."
"14702780","14703880"," How much time we got left here?"
"14704880","14706440"," Let's do the creepy crawler at the wall."
"14709520","14717920"," Yeah, I think they're just grinding. "
"14718420","14720500"," Well, it looks like two things to me."
"14721080","14724040"," It looks like they could pin this close."
"14725060","14732300"," It also looks like they could run it up into the bell and try to burn all the zero dates"
"14732300","14733900"," from today if they do run it up. "
"14734820","14738440"," So be really tactful in what you're buying."
"14738440","14740420"," If you're buying zero dates, be really tactful."
"14741040","14744200"," They could pin it or they could squeeze it up and try to murder options. "
"14744260","14745780"," It's very difficult to trade them."
"14746660","14748440"," What I would be doing if it was me."
"14748620","14752120"," I'm flat still right now, but it's two fifty four. "
"14752240","14754720"," We've got power hour starting here in six minutes."
"14755520","14762120"," So I would be paying attention to three p.m. and I'd be paying attention to three twenty and three"
"14762120","14762500"," forty."
"14762500","14766240"," If you remember those time periods, like three o'clock, three twenty, three forty. "
"14766820","14772880"," I usually prick my ears up there and look for some kind of an entry to do a run up"
"14772880","14773380"," into the close."
"14773960","14775420"," So we'll pay attention to those time periods."
"14776060","14776700"," It's two fifty four. "
"14776780","14778360"," We've got six minutes left for the half an hour."
"14778920","14781200"," We have another half hour period coming up at three thirty."
"14782100","14786420"," We'll be hyper aware of what happens around that twenty past and that forty past. "
"14786660","14789960"," If we get the squeeze to the upside, or if it's sour hour to the downside."
"14789960","14794930"," So we'll watch this right now into the close."
"14797310","14799250"," Nothing really to do here right now. "
"14799350","14804950"," It's more like, it's more like just hang out, hang out, let power our start."
"14805890","14809750"," And we'll see with a direction of which way we had if we actually squeezed the upside."
"14810530","14814350"," If they pin it into the close, we start running any of that kind of stuff. "
"14830080","14830840"," Oh, man."
"14831840","14834480"," Yeah, it was a good rally today."
"14834520","14835020"," We needed it. "
"14835200","14836100"," Not only do we need it."
"14836460","14837320"," That's actually a good point."
"14837580","14839460"," So who wrote that shot us seven one eight. "
"14839920","14841800"," Wrote a nice rally today."
"14841820","14844540"," You know that bulls don't really have a choice to do that."
"14845580","14850640"," Bull's kind of like they have to rally above four thirty four. "
"14851700","14853140"," They can't not rally."
"14853140","14855100"," I don't know what bulls think they're going to do."
"14855240","14858040"," They're just going to fuck around over here because the longer we fuck around. "
"14858540","14860500"," If the easy way is down, right?"
"14860800","14865520"," If there's no demand to go higher, then maybe we go lower, right?"
"14865800","14867520"," That's usually it's pretty simple."
"14868180","14873580"," If there's no demand to go higher, we'll find a place that people want to buy, right?"
"14874280","14878180"," You heard the rich people this week whining that they wanted a better price."
"14878980","14880480"," They were all over CNBC. "
"14881140","14882540"," They were all over Fintuit."
"14883120","14885780"," You know, they were demanding cheaper prices, right?"
"14886940","14891620"," If you want me to go long, I expect the spy to be at three fifty."
"14892340","14893780"," I demand a recount. "
"14895900","14897960"," I missed the run from three fifty."
"14901420","14902920"," I never jumped on board."
"14903060","14905480"," If you're going to go there again, I want to buy it down there. "
"14907120","14910480"," I got some catch up to do into the end of the year here, Sonny."
"14913100","14915660"," So, you know, if we don't find that."
"14918140","14919500"," That will to go higher?"
"14920040","14921140"," Yeah, we'll go down there, but. "
"14924660","14926920"," The bulls really don't have a choice here, do they?"
"14928060","14932740"," They like, so if you're a buyer, if you're a buyer, this is your last stand."
"14932740","14933640"," You get what I'm saying?"
"14934200","14942660"," If you're a buyer, if you want to enter the market long on calls or buy stock, this is your"
"14942660","14943020"," place."
"14944860","14950580"," If you don't find that another hundred people are going to come with you. "
"14952140","14954020"," We're going to go much lower, aren't we?"
"14954420","14956120"," So we'll go way, way lower, right?"
"14956260","14956740"," We'll try four."
"14957260","14958200"," How about 4,000?"
"14958280","14958740"," You want to buy that?"
"14959220","14959480"," No?"
"14959760","14960360"," How about 3,500?"
"14960660","14961160"," You want to buy that?"
"14961620","14962440"," You got what I'm saying?"
"14962780","14970720"," So, and this is the moment where if they are going to buy this, if they're going to buy this"
"14970720","14973900"," pig, which is our stock market, right?"
"14974040","14974600"," A stank market."
"14975000","14982180"," If they buy this pig, they have to get it done and they have to move above that daily trigger"
"14982180","14982780"," at 434. "
"14983740","14984880"," So we're going to find out it."
"14984980","14987020"," We're going to find out today tomorrow, not tomorrow."
"14987020","14992200"," Today, Monday, we're going to know if the buyers are really here or not. "
"14992580","14996720"," And within the next five to, you know, three to five sessions."
"14997640","15001280"," No, I mean, I think it's five to seven sessions."
"15001560","15006960"," I'm giving you changes because it includes NASDAQ and SPX. "
"15007660","15013580"," And NASDAQ and SPX basically, NASDAQ has like three sessions left to go really bullish."
"15014360","15017520"," And SPX has like five sessions left to go bullish."
"15017980","15022940"," So, I mean, if we sell it to the depths of hell, I'm fine. "
"15023420","15030420"," But this is the last chance for bulls to see if they want this or not."
"15031380","15031480"," Right?"
"15031700","15032200"," This is their chance."
"15032660","15033660"," Like, here you go, bull. "
"15034800","15035680"," Buy 418."
"15037460","15038120"," Run it up."
"15038320","15042260"," And if not enough bulls believe that, we will go down. "
"15042260","15044000"," We will burn to the depths of hell."
"15051160","15053560"," So, I am not a fan of that trade."
"15053740","15054280"," It's a good question. "
"15055380","15064180"," If price is stuck between weekly and daily trigger, I am a buyer of the price above the weekly."
"15064520","15066740"," I'm a buyer of S&P 500."
"15067500","15069640"," I'm a seller of it when it reaches the daily trigger. "
"15070380","15075220"," And I'm not a rebire of price until it's above the daily trigger."
"15075740","15076260"," Does that make sense?"
"15077180","15083580"," And I would prefer to have the hourly trigger right behind price or crossing the daily trigger as I"
"15083580","15084220"," bought it as well."
"15084440","15084900"," It's a good question. "
"15085760","15087560"," That is like a finger trap."
"15087780","15088920"," Like, you know, the paper finger traps?"
"15090380","15094220"," It's a zone of consolidation between the weekly and daily."
"15095160","15097480"," And you want nothing to do with the middle of that. "
"15097760","15098700"," That's a fair point."
"15098700","15100680"," So, you want to buy like the weekly trigger?"
"15101280","15102780"," Take it to the daily trigger, you can do that."
"15103240","15106500"," But don't get caught in the middle of that weekly trigger or daily trigger. "
"15106660","15107380"," Don't be trying to buy dips."
"15108120","15111460"," So, like, right now, we're just getting above the weekly trigger right here, right?"
"15111960","15113320"," Like, you can buy dips right here."
"15113880","15115140"," You can ride this up. "
"15116320","15118700"," Do not get caught in there, though, right?"
"15119220","15124760"," Only if price gets above, do you pick up another trade higher, is my point."
"15125420","15132540"," But if we ping pong in here, if we ping pong in here, I'm not bullish."
"15133580","15135060"," In no way, shape or form. "
"15135460","15140260"," I don't trust being caught in between that weekly and daily trigger at all."
"15140680","15145220"," Like, if you get caught in there, I don't believe a bull or a bear."
"15145580","15148680"," I'm not a believer in the bull thesis or bear thesis in there. "
"15149500","15153160"," I believe in they're going to get wrecked in that in that trade."
"15153160","15155460"," Good, that's a good point to bring up."
"15156380","15157440"," Who brought that up?"
"15165070","15166610"," Stression wall is a good question, brother. "
"15169910","15172470"," Bond market being a wild card here."
"15173210","15174430"," Let's look at the bond market."
"15174650","15177330"," What do you guys want to look at?"
"15178010","15182370"," So you've got some questions coming out there, 10 year yield. "
"15183630","15187010"," You want to do the 10s, the 2s, the 3s, the 20s, what do you want to do?"
"15197460","15199440"," 10 year yield, 30 minute chart."
"15199760","15202240"," Let's do a 30 minute chart here."
"15203080","15205440"," Let's see if we can take a look at it. "
"15207100","15207880"," Trigger screen."
"15210840","15214020"," You guys had this, you guys had this from me."
"15217100","15222920"," You guys had this from the beta posts on the website about this. "
"15223740","15225760"," And we'll talk about it right now."
"15225980","15233840"," So before any of this happened, for any of this happened so far, you had Bill Ackman and Larry Fink"
"15233840","15239560"," projecting 5% up here."
"15242270","15244550"," We got 4.9 right here. "
"15245510","15247290"," We found sellers, right?"
"15248130","15250090"," We got new sellers right here."
"15250550","15252010"," That's not a good sign, by the way."
"15253090","15254610"," Double top on 10 year. "
"15254870","15255790"," That's not a good sign."
"15256010","15261110"," I would have preferred the sell off and the ramp up here."
"15261190","15262050"," That would be my preference. "
"15262870","15266770"," I don't like that price action right there, to be honest."
"15267070","15269510"," I would have liked to have seen price just green higher."
"15269910","15273230"," So this is what Bill Ackman and Larry Fink are projecting. "
"15274030","15277330"," Goldman Sachs is really the outlier."
"15277330","15286430"," So before we got here, before any of this was showing, Goldman Sachs was predicting that we would"
"15286430","15288090"," roll down here."
"15289190","15293610"," And then some kind of intermediary sideways action. "
"15295630","15297830"," That would give bulls some relief."
"15299570","15301450"," So that would give bulls some relief."
"15301810","15303590"," And then Goldman thought it would go back up. "
"15303590","15305270"," And we would roll."
"15305530","15312230"," So I'm assuming that that would mean that Goldman thinks we trade 4.35, 4.40. During this period of"
"15312230","15312590"," time."
"15312850","15317830"," And then we roll or reject that 4.44, that 4.40, that 4.30, 4.35, whatever. "
"15318550","15320770"," So that's my assumption is that was Goldman's take."
"15322130","15327010"," Now right now, can we haven't broken trend yet, right?"
"15327170","15333310"," So if we have not broken trend to the upside of the 10 year, bears have to be given consideration"
"15333310","15335090"," here, right?"
"15335650","15337470"," They're still grinding up over here."
"15338050","15343190"," This is also going to imply that the market rolls into today. "
"15343550","15346830"," It also implies that the market could crash into Monday."
"15347570","15348290"," Right?"
"15349050","15351410"," Well not crash, excuse me."
"15351410","15357850"," That we squeeze up here into Monday and that would give you the downside move to $4.13 or $4 "
"15357850","15362390",".03. If you woke up on Monday morning and yields were way up here, I'd give you that. "
"15363150","15368470"," For the squeeze above $4.35, you'd want to see the break into Monday here."
"15369130","15372770"," And then a failure of trend on the 10 years."
"15373050","15380090"," So you're probably looking for a break of 4.68% on the 10 year. "
"15380830","15383250"," 4.86% this line right here."
"15383350","15384790"," So this coming into the weekend."
"15386070","15387430"," There's a break of this trend. "
"15387550","15390110"," You could even set an alert on this line right here."
"15390910","15397910"," You could set make your own line at home and set an alert in case of a break."
"15398330","15401590"," So this right here is yep, this yellow trend right here. "
"15401810","15404550"," You could set like a just an alert on this line right here."
"15405150","15408670"," And if you get the break below it, you already know where we're going, right?"
"15408950","15410410"," You know we're going, we're going to the moon."
"15413710","15416930"," There are people that think we're going higher than 5%. "
"15417530","15421490"," There are people that think that we're going to go to 6%, right?"
"15422650","15423650"," We're 6%."
"15427550","15430650"," You know, there are people out there that think we're going even higher."
"15430910","15431730"," I don't particularly. "
"15432690","15439050"," I'm going to tell you that I think that the Bill Ackman projection of 5% is best case scenario."
"15440610","15443190"," This is best case there in my view for right now."
"15443590","15446030"," That's what I'm looking for that 6% that 5%. "
"15447010","15449290"," I think it's a big, nice big fat round number."
"15449710","15452890"," I also see these two things right here."
"15453530","15454970"," Give me cause for concern. "
"15455910","15458670"," Like this looks like distribution, right?"
"15459030","15465430"," Sell into strength on 5% and then get it to roll down over here right over there."
"15466190","15469230"," So I think 5 is about where you look for."
"15469770","15471290"," And where are we right here?"
"15471490","15472410"," We're at the top. "
"15474590","15476750"," 4.88%. Can it go to 5?"
"15478290","15481790"," That would represent the weakness into next week on the stock market."
"15483010","15486350"," But you know, this stuff here is not good for bears."
"15486730","15487590"," Bears don't like seeing that. "
"15489310","15493110"," And if that, if that 5 is just like, it's like anything, right?"
"15493110","15494470"," You have a target of 5."
"15494730","15498690"," They sell earlier, like slightly before you actually get to the target."
"15499070","15500430"," They just unload into you."
"15500670","15502570"," So we're close. "
"15503570","15506970"," We're at least in the meantime, least in the meantime for right now."
"15507610","15514790"," Now, if you got, if you wanted to see a continuation of the upside into the end of the year,"
"15514950","15516490"," you're going to be looking for this to be traded."
"15517630","15519570"," All this garbage right here to be traded. "
"15519570","15525110"," And I would be very scared of whatever rate decision comes out for November."
"15527490","15530070"," That'll have a huge impact on this over here."
"15533590","15534990"," So yeah, 10 year yield. "
"15537210","15544340"," And, you know, I got to be honest."
"15545520","15547060"," I got to be honest with you."
"15549200","15552620"," The inversion will uninvert at some point too. "
"15552620","15559160"," And if you're, if you're a firm believer in the yield inversion and the yield curve and all that"
"15559160","15559600"," kind of stuff."
"15560240","15561140"," I implore you."
"15561240","15570820"," I always tell you guys this that it does not always directly correlate"
"15570820","15573700"," to the equity markets going up and down. "
"15574180","15575260"," It does not."
"15575680","15580520"," There's, I've shown it on the stream in the past that you can see a yield curve inversion."
"15580520","15587220"," You can see, you can see the curve just go higher and higher and higher. "
"15587220","15588920"," You can in the market not go down."
"15589160","15592780"," So I need you guys out there to understand that."
"15594460","15596020"," I need you guys to understand that. "
"15598100","15606120"," You're probably your most probably your most reliable indicator is always going to be unemployment."
"15609040","15610840"," That's your most reliable indicator."
"15612220","15614960"," Even if it's fudge, even if you think it's bad or whatever. "
"15615740","15617920"," I want you to know that that's your most reliable indicator."
"15620040","15627260"," Sometimes if you put it all together like are we at max rate increases are we pausing are we"
"15627260","15629280"," rolling them over is unemployment rising."
"15631420","15635580"," Is inflation at a bottom is that 2% is another big part of that equation. "
"15636540","15638140"," Then the last part would be."
"15640480","15641700"," The last part would be."
"15643560","15647880"," The comparisons that I see like we're talking about it yesterday on stream. "
"15650280","15654280"," I asked you guys in stream yesterday of the day before I can't remember I think it was yesterday."
"15655320","15656400"," But I went on a rant."
"15657360","15662840"," And I went on this rant about housing I was like. "
"15663880","15668800"," When the rant about housing I went on the rant about who is bitching and who is getting hurt."
"15669940","15675740"," Like who's actually getting hurt is it real hurt is the kind of hurt that impacts the stock market."
"15676220","15681060"," And the answer is fuck no right and the numbers this morning are saying kind of saying the same"
"15681060","15681540"," thing right. "
"15685880","15691730"," So the unemployment your one like unemployment is it for you."
"15692610","15696470"," Although I like the yield curve and I like I like using the 10s and 2s 10s and 3s and"
"15696470","15698970"," all kinds of 3s about 3s and 10s."
"15699050","15703470"," But it's still not at it's not good enough for me. "
"15704930","15706950"," Like I want to see like rates really high."
"15707210","15708550"," I want to see unemployment raging."
"15709090","15711830"," I want to see inflation at like 2 or under. "
"15711830","15715210"," I want to see the yield curve blasting."
"15715510","15719290"," I want to see like all those mechanics all those wheels at the same time."
"15721210","15722450"," All at the same time. "
"15723130","15729710"," And those those numbers today are not in GDP too right GDP is another part of this."
"15730550","15734690"," You want GDP getting fucking getting hammered."
"15735530","15736970"," So we're not seeing it just yet. "
"15739730","15740950"," Trade and sideways right now."
"15741030","15745070"," We know the gamma pin is right where we are on this R3 right here."
"15745850","15749910"," Do they run a creepy crawly up the wall into the close will become the question. "
"15750930","15752670"," We are in power hour right now."
"15752750","15758610"," It's 3 10 p.m. If you are a bull I'm going to warn you that you are not safe"
"15758610","15758890"," here."
"15759150","15760470"," You are not safe at this price. "
"15761230","15763330"," You are not safe above the weekly trigger."
"15764470","15765610"," You are not safe over the weekend."
"15766530","15773010"," Do not think that at any point that you are safe unless you get above the 434. "
"15773490","15778670"," And hold it and get the week the hourly trigger to come give you a hand."
"15779110","15782110"," So like you get a lot of work ahead of you over this weekend."
"15783370","15787550"," And if you wake up in the markets bloody as fuck on Monday. "
"15788430","15789610"," I warned you of that."
"15789670","15793490"," Okay, so we're going to need to give you this so you're not like a captain said."
"15794210","15799110"," We're going to 4500 on Monday or something like I want you saying that about me. "
"15799950","15806390"," But I want you to know that there's no safety for you here on the weekly trigger if you're a"
"15806390","15806590"," bull."
"15807570","15808110"," None."
"15808850","15810910"," No, no, no, no safety for you. "
"15815120","15818160"," You aren't like toast and champagne bottles and glasses."
"15819340","15824860"," You need to be above there to if you want to start getting bullish you need price daily."
"15824860","15830460"," If you want to get bullish you need price hourly trigger daily trigger weekly trigger monthly"
"15830460","15831520"," trigger in that order. "
"15832040","15832740"," You get that order."
"15833420","15835440"," You can start sucking each other off all day long."
"15835680","15836420"," You're a buyer bull. "
"15837220","15840760"," You want to start sucking each other off like I love you were going all time highs."
"15840960","15844700"," You got to be you need price hourly daily weekly monthly."
"15845140","15846760"," You do that you can start sucking each other off. "
"15847900","15849100"," You can't do that yet."
"15852580","15853880"," Yeah, I'm still flat right now."
"15853900","15854500"," I haven't done nothing. "
"15855240","15856360"," I haven't added anything."
"15863100","15865260"," You ain't got no w yet, bulls."
"15868440","15870040"," There's shit non bulls in the stream. "
"15870700","15871320"," God damn it."
"15871540","15872340"," I thought that guy like bulls."
"15873440","15877240"," Yeah, that's the other thing. "
"15877360","15877840"," Good note, right?"
"15877840","15878400"," Who said that?"
"15881020","15884860"," Seacantastic said that the bond market is closed on Monday."
"15885380","15888800"," It's closed for indigenous people day, right?"
"15889340","15892400"," Some people say Columbus days people days say indigenous people day."
"15892860","15896160"," So we do have the bond market closed on Monday for that. "
"15896400","15896540"," Absolutely."
"15897620","15898880"," What does that mean, right?"
"15899820","15904600"," That mean we squeeze up and then the bond market implodes in itself and goes to like five or six"
"15904600","15905420"," percent by Monday."
"15905420","15907780"," It's like a it's like an immediate cell. "
"15907980","15908680"," I would say that."
"15909420","15913960"," I would think that I would think that if we if we moon into like Monday, Tuesday."
"15914880","15919540"," And then we come back to the bond market on Tuesday and they're just like fuck this cell. "
"15921940","15924040"," That would be funny."
"15925540","15928980"," Like wake up Tuesday and the bond market's out like six, seven percent."
"15938790","15940010"," Yeah, I miss talking about you. "
"15940090","15940690"," That's what I'm doing."
"15941610","15942810"," If we don't get above."
"15944070","15945610"," I'll be buying puts into the clothes. "
"15945710","15946390"," I have to."
"15946510","15946870"," I don't have a choice."
"15948190","15950810"," I'm required to spend the insurance money. "
"15951350","15952510"," Let's take a look at him right now."
"15952530","15953350"," You want to look at him right now?"
"15953570","15953770"," Hold on."
"15955750","15957870"," Let's look at Monday, Wednesday and Friday. "
"15965800","15967800"," So if we failed, right?"
"15968200","15969100"," So let's look at this for."
"15969580","15971420"," Let's look at this seriously right now."
"15971480","15974640"," I wish I had an options profit calculator and I don't. "
"15974780","15977220"," We have one being built, but I wish we had one."
"15977420","15981880"," So if we get a failure, right?"
"15982500","15983800"," We know what it is, right?"
"15984040","15986160"," We know the failure is below the weekly trigger."
"15987220","15990100"," So we know below four 29 bears are safe. "
"15992000","15996320"," So anything, any strike below that four 29 into the close."
"15997660","15998860"," And where would be the target?"
"15999580","16001240"," So if we fail, right?"
"16001520","16009500"," If bulls buyers, bulls fail to follow through here into the weekend, what would the targets"
"16009500","16011520"," downside targets be in two Monday?"
"16015420","16018120"," First one is going to be four 27 61."
"16018740","16021200"," So if you wanted to get like a four 28 or a four 27. "
"16022060","16023080"," That would be good."
"16024400","16034890"," And if you want to get the put for later in time, like Wednesday or Friday, four"
"16034890","16036350"," or five would be nice."
"16037670","16038710"," Four or five on spy. "
"16044370","16048130"," So those are 59 cents, 41 cents for Monday."
"16048630","16049790"," That's not really helping me."
"16056460","16063540"," For October 10th, four oh threes are three cents. "
"16064500","16065440"," That's looking nicer."
"16071490","16075810"," Four 12 peas for the 10th are only five cents, six cents."
"16076950","16081090"," So there is some choice buys in here. "
"16085470","16087610"," The 11th, you can grab."
"16089150","16092890"," Four oh sevens for six cents for the 11th."
"16096470","16098210"," The 13th that Friday. "
"16098750","16107290"," I don't like the Friday prices."
"16108050","16110350"," I don't really like those prices for Friday."
"16111130","16113590"," Like the 400 is nine cents. "
"16115210","16116990"," For Friday of next week."
"16117870","16121730"," So that they are dealers are saying there's still a chance we come back down next week."
"16122950","16125490"," Dealers have a little bit of faith in that happening. "
"16127030","16128510"," Wednesday, they don't."
"16129090","16131990"," They think if there's a role to the downside next week."
"16133410","16138110"," There's some premium on that downside move coming Thursday and Friday. "
"16139010","16140890"," That's a little bit pricier, but."
"16143410","16147090"," Four four oh fives or 12 cents for Friday."
"16147950","16149850"," So four oh fives are 12 cents. "
"16149950","16152510"," You don't need to hold them all the way down to fucking four oh five."
"16152810","16155990"," You just hold them till they print like 20 30 cents or something."
"16157050","16159570"," But that's available to under Friday, but they do. "
"16159610","16162830"," They are putting some premium on that rejection and trade lower."
"16163970","16164850"," Into Friday."
"16166630","16168950"," So we'll look at that trade as we head into this close. "
"16170190","16172490"," Let's see if I can get rid of some of this stuff so that we can."
"16173170","16174370"," Pay close for attention."
"16175850","16178190"," Market is still long right now into the bell. "
"16182590","16184330"," There's our three right there."
"16190970","16193690"," Man, I want to buy some calls right now in the close."
"16195150","16198390"," I would really like to see us like squeeze up here. "
"16199210","16202450"," And then buy some puts like by puts right there be badass."
"16204570","16205830"," I'd really like that."
"16206510","16208590"," So we'll see we'll see where we wind up into the close. "
"16209370","16210710"," And we'll see."
"16211870","16213490"," Move that over so you can see it."
"16217720","16219060"," See if we get the role. "
"16220500","16223720"," We're about to close the downside about to get bearish here."
"16224940","16230180"," We'll look for this hourly trigger down below that's sitting at four twenty five twenty five."
"16231140","16234510"," To keep this open. "
"16245070","16246310"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"16247010","16247570"," Thanks."
"16247570","16248050"," Thanks. "
"16250390","16250990"," Appreciate that."
"16251110","16251590"," Who said that?"
"16253350","16254490"," Appreciate that critical draw."
"16258070","16261250"," Hey, are you doing recovering bear bear a bear holiday and brother?"
"16261330","16261790"," Good to see you. "
"16264700","16267440"," Yeah, I'm building a profit calculator right now."
"16267900","16268840"," You should have it."
"16269080","16270340"," We should have it in the next couple weeks. "
"16270780","16273780"," So I can't wait to have one available for you guys."
"16274380","16275820"," It'll always be free too."
"16276520","16277980"," We're doing that one for free. "
"16279520","16283100"," So we'll keep that free so we can build trades together and look at the possible payoff."
"16283360","16284580"," What we need for a possible payoff."
"16293210","16295350"," Dow surges three hundred points. "
"16333610","16335350"," Move that over so you can read that."
"16337030","16338630"," Put that news up for you."
"16338670","16339530"," I forgot to do that today. "
"16339730","16341110"," I've been forgetting to do that, haven't I?"
"16341650","16344410"," Move that tip cover, tip jar over a little bit."
"16344710","16344850"," Nope."
"16345670","16346450"," No, no, no. "
"16347170","16347190"," Nope."
"16348350","16348470"," Nope."
"16349170","16349910"," Am I doing wrong here?"
"16350110","16350590"," Oh, oh. "
"16351130","16352150"," I messed that up."
"16355010","16356810"," Slide that over for you right there."
"16356990","16357730"," There you go. "
"16358430","16359130"," Make that pretty."
"16363440","16364780"," That back for you."
"16364900","16365860"," Nice and pretty over there. "
"16395060","16395800"," Oh, dude."
"16397759","16400759"," So, Tom Lee did something today."
"16401820","16403140"," You guys want to see something?"
"16403419","16404020"," Hold on a second here. "
"16404020","16405300"," Tom Lee came on."
"16406040","16407200"," Do you know what just happened?"
"16408240","16409160"," Hold on a second here."
"16410300","16411779"," Let me see if they can show you guys this. "
"16411919","16412140"," Hold on."
"16412740","16413820"," Guess what we just finished."
"16415540","16421369"," I'm really going to show you this. "
"16421470","16422110"," Hold on a second here."
"16423250","16423750"," Come on."
"16423869","16424550"," Give me one quick second. "
"16424770","16425210"," Hold on a second."
"16425330","16425970"," Hold on one second here."
"16489220","16491520"," Let's see if this, let's see if I can show this. "
"16496180","16496900"," Headset problems."
"16496900","16498520"," I'm having all kinds of issues here."
"16500880","16502680"," You got to see Tom Lee came out today?"
"16507439","16510759"," Did you guys say that Tom Lee came out and said we're going to go to Bull Run?"
"16512820","16513640"," Oh, yeah. "
"16514040","16515000"," That guy right there."
"16517779","16518740"," Who's that?"
"16519900","16522419"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"16523099","16524640"," I can't wait to hang that thing up. "
"16525200","16530619"," He's going to join the class of, um, of, uh, the fouries right on our wall."
"16532220","16533259"," Oh, yeah."
"16534259","16536220"," Look at that dirty right there. "
"16536860","16538419"," We haven't hung it up yet."
"16538779","16539220"," Oh."
"16540439","16540960"," Oh. "
"16544960","16546619"," He's looking right at you too."
"16546840","16547140"," Look at him."
"16547220","16548040"," He's looking at you too. "
"16563540","16565500"," I can't wait to hang that one up."
"16568439","16569500"," Nothing is terrible."
"16569500","16570340"," Look at that thing. "
"16571380","16573919"," You know, Tom Lee just slays it too."
"16578220","16580460"," It's good for a 300-point sell-off, isn't it?"
"16588720","16590240"," How do you like that painting?"
"16592140","16593040"," We got Tom Lee."
"16593320","16594400"," We got Tom Lee today. "
"16595540","16596320"," Look at that."
"16596520","16597119"," That thing is dirty."
"16598840","16599340"," Whoa!"
"16600960","16602419"," Look at Tom Lee. "
"16602419","16603400"," He's like..."
"16604520","16607240"," He's like, so we're going to have a..."
"16607240","16609460"," I'm telling you we're going to 5,000."
"16609860","16610840"," 5,000."
"16611000","16612140"," I've been telling you since I..."
"16612140","16613960"," I didn't say shit until December. "
"16615020","16615980"," You didn't say that."
"16616200","16617220"," We're in October though, did he?"
"16618160","16618680"," Look at him."
"16618820","16619980"," He's like, we're definitely going up there. "
"16620300","16622540"," 6,000 next after that one."
"16625419","16627939"," Somebody should post that on Twitter a picture of this."
"16627939","16630660"," And say, what up, Tom?"
"16631900","16633020"," What's going on, brother?"
"16639029","16639590"," Hold on. "
"16639669","16640750"," I'm going to grab some calls with you."
"16640890","16641270"," Hold on here."
"16645660","16647419"," Yeah, I like those calls too. "
"16647560","16648300"," I like the idea behind that."
"16648759","16649140"," Hold on here."
"16663849","16664869"," Wait for me. "
"16672110","16672730"," I'm long."
"16673630","16674509"," 431 C's."
"16675630","16677009"," Very small position though, okay?"
"16677230","16679450"," So I'm not doing like 50 hot packs, 100 packs. "
"16681169","16684290"," But I do want to, I do want some taste in this trade."
"16685669","16687490"," Like a Friday lotto trade."
"16687770","16693270"," So I'm going to call them out of that and see if they actually go up there and ride this"
"16693270","16693630"," close. "
"16695250","16696450"," So I'm long with you."
"16696509","16696849"," I got you."
"16697710","16699810"," I want to see if we can trade that last. "
"16700550","16701970"," We can do this gap up here."
"16702810","16707270"," I don't put a high probability of that happening, but I'll hold them."
"16708189","16708950"," See what's up. "
"16709330","16709930"," I'm with you."
"16711930","16713470"," I'm interested in the trade."
"16714790","16716990"," I'm interested in the squeeze up into the close. "
"16719710","16720890"," It's a fun little trade."
"16721230","16723590"," So we're trading above the one and five minute."
"16723689","16724310"," We got a bull cross. "
"16724849","16729550"," If at any point we break through and go to the downside, I'll cut them loose, but it ain't going"
"16729550","16729849"," to matter."
"16730009","16733570"," They'll probably be worth like five cents if there's a cross to the downside."
"16735689","16736310"," We'll see. "
"16736650","16738130"," We'll see what happens into this close."
"16738529","16739270"," That's a nice picture."
"16739550","16743270"," So my oldest daughter painted that for me. "
"16744130","16745050"," She painted that."
"16745210","16746090"," Well, she painted it for you guys."
"16747369","16750369"," So she painted the Mike Burry. "
"16751830","16758869"," Prince and I gave her a picture of Tom Lee from, I think, New York or New York Times or"
"16758869","16759150"," something."
"16759849","16760869"," It was like, you paint me this."
"16761790","16762990"," And she did. "
"16762990","16767869"," She added that orange and red or the yellow and red background from a Canva idea."
"16768349","16771250"," It was like a background on Canva that I showed and a bunch of different colors."
"16771610","16773430"," And she painted it all. "
"16774070","16777650"," And she knows that I actually like Tom Lee, like him a lot."
"16777910","16779730"," And I like Mike Burry, believe it or not."
"16780590","16783070"," I don't dislike Mike Burry in any way, shape or form. "
"16784910","16786310"," So what do we do next?"
"16786690","16793150"," Now that we're done with that painting, remember you guys voted on like, you guys voted on Tom Lee"
"16793150","16795510"," and you voted on Mike Burry."
"16795770","16798330"," So you got to start thinking about who's next."
"16799630","16804550"," Like who's the next person that we paint?"
"16808800","16810040"," What's the target on ES?"
"16810360","16810540"," What do you want?"
"16810680","16810800"," ES?"
"16811480","16811640"," Hold on. "
"16811680","16812000"," You want an ES?"
"16812820","16813800"," Let's do ES really quick."
"16815160","16816600"," You got a bunch of future traders in here."
"16816680","16817160"," You ready for it?"
"16820540","16821460"," You're a future trader. "
"16821780","16822620"," Here you go."
"16825780","16826740"," Weekly trigger."
"16827200","16828940"," Five minutes across the weekly trigger. "
"16829980","16834240"," We are also going to head up and attempt to trade."
"16835900","16840880"," 4394.53. 4394.53 would be the target to the upside here."
"16841920","16842560"," So if you are. "
"16844440","16846300"," If you are a futures trader."
"16848840","16851240"," And you're trying to sell that yellow as well."
"16855060","16855760"," SPX. "
"16855960","16856780"," We'll look at that one next."
"16860850","16863990"," SPX still has not broken through its weekly trigger."
"16865090","16866530"," It is required. "
"16867670","16868370"," Required."
"16871330","16875990"," 4SPY to squeeze higher than the daily trigger or slip through."
"16877230","16882430"," So this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the entire idea of. "
"16883310","16887910"," I posted this on the website and then I posted on Twitter a bunch."
"16889450","16891490"," Where you thread the needle, right?"
"16892110","16895390"," You thread the needle with price before."
"16898800","16904900"," The daily trigger has a chance to cross down and reject price. "
"16905400","16905560"," Okay."
"16908740","16911180"," So, so this is the thread the needle part, right?"
"16911180","16913040"," Like price has to get up here."
"16913640","16915840"," Has to slip through before. "
"16917920","16918680"," Before."
"16919760","16922220"," The daily trigger crosses, right?"
"16922880","16925200"," So you kind of like putting this on."
"16925660","16933540"," You kind of putting this on the, the onus here between now and Monday is on bulls to close the"
"16933540","16933960"," weekend. "
"16934840","16935200"," Above."
"16935920","16938020"," Like close SPX above."
"16940140","16941980"," Spy starting to squeeze right now. "
"16942840","16943680"," Do you know what I'm saying?"
"16943900","16949120"," So you're looking for the algorithms to push us up so that the daily trigger saves us."
"16950200","16950680"," Okay."
"16951580","16953500"," So we don't have a lot of time left here. "
"16955820","16958780"," And with there not being enough time left here."
"16960240","16962100"," You're kind of doing a, what are you doing?"
"16962100","16964360"," You're doing a, you're doing a Mexican standoff, right?"
"16964660","16965640"," You're doing like the gun fight."
"16966180","16967000"," Everybody's got a gun. "
"16967620","16969480"," It's like a Quentin Tarantino movie."
"16971040","16973420"," It's like a, who's the other guy that used to do that?"
"16973580","16975760"," Who's the guy that did Mario, El Mariachi?"
"16976400","16978020"," It's like one of his movies too, right?"
"16978620","16982000"," You got, you got like no choice here, right?"
"16982220","16984080"," But to go up and get above that daily trigger."
"16984380","16987940"," So they're going to see who flinches first. "
"16989740","16990140"," Right."
"16990360","16991180"," They do it over the weekend."
"16991380","16992780"," They do it into the end of the bell. "
"16992780","16995960"," Do they do it into Monday while the bond market is closed?"
"16996480","16997280"," Or does it reject?"
"16998080","17002580"," SPX is actually showing you the reason I'm saying this to you, right?"
"17003560","17005960"," Like SPX, let's go back to that chart really quick."
"17007380","17013500"," So SPX is actually showing you the danger here for a bull."
"17015100","17016240"," Better than spy. "
"17018940","17020640"," So let's do some doom."
"17020860","17022300"," Let's do a doom chart for a bear."
"17025720","17026560"," So there's the doom. "
"17026740","17028600"," This is a doom chart for bears here."
"17030580","17032900"," Now this sideways bar."
"17035360","17037260"," Is really not sideways yet. "
"17037400","17039000"," It's actually not been formed yet."
"17039880","17043120"," But this is where you get."
"17045140","17047300"," If price doesn't break above. "
"17048130","17049340"," You know what happens, right?"
"17050300","17052240"," We get the cross on the daily trigger."
"17054890","17056670"," That's why that's so important, right?"
"17058010","17060490"," We end up having happened here."
"17061150","17063090"," So this flat bar means nothing. "
"17063350","17063790"," It's just today."
"17064170","17067230"," It's going to pick a direction after today."
"17068250","17072850"," But if you get that rejection here, what happens is you get the yellow bar. "
"17073510","17076690"," We'll have a close going down the downward direction, right?"
"17076690","17077590"," Like downward dog."
"17079410","17080330"," See what I'm saying?"
"17080690","17082470"," So into Monday, Tuesday."
"17083530","17087770"," You got 411, 3.5 down there. "
"17088730","17092190"," So this is that danger, danger zone for bulls here in this close."
"17093490","17097810"," Big danger zone into Monday for bulls here."
"17097950","17098950"," So they want to be above. "
"17099290","17106130"," They want to get, they want to squeeze up and get above here and circumvent that crash."
"17107190","17112790"," The planned crash for the planned crash for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week."
"17113610","17114890"," So we got, we got to the close. "
"17115850","17118310"," To see if that works itself out of it happens."
"17118650","17120010"," We got until Monday."
"17121010","17123750"," You already know if you're a bull that you cannot. "
"17125750","17128390"," Trust any of the price action from today."
"17129190","17131410"," Unless you break above that daily trigger."
"17131410","17137070"," And so that's your, this is, this is what you're looking for right here. "
"17137850","17139530"," Is that target right there?"
"17139650","17141010"," There's your one minute chart right now."
"17141310","17142630"," And this is your target."
"17144030","17145610"," You can see the trend line. "
"17146790","17148710"," You see the trend line right here, right?"
"17149230","17150290"," There's one part of it."
"17150530","17151910"," There's the other part of it down there."
"17152990","17155050"," You got the top of the trend up here. "
"17156870","17158410"," And you need that squeeze."
"17159450","17160410"," You have to get it."
"17163330","17165690"," Do you think we get it as the big question, right?"
"17166730","17168110"," Or do you think we crash it?"
"17170550","17171550"," That's the big question. "
"17171750","17172430"," Do we crash it?"
"17172630","17173330"," Do we squeeze it?"
"17178670","17180310"," Oh, Kathy would."
"17180810","17181570"," She's a good pick."
"17183270","17184950"," Well, let me see what you guys are saying there. "
"17187610","17188330"," Let me see."
"17189690","17192270"," Keith Danives or Dan Niles, maybe."
"17192970","17193370"," Oh, hedge. "
"17193590","17193870"," I did."
"17194170","17194790"," Yeah, hedge."
"17195010","17195990"," I did would be a guy to do. "
"17196270","17197870"," He's always angry too, isn't he?"
"17198230","17198390"," Is he?"
"17198510","17199850"," I don't know if that's true or not."
"17200650","17202530"," I could be assigning that to somebody else."
"17202870","17203170"," Is the hedge. "
"17203350","17204610"," I guy always pissy or no."
"17204770","17205850"," Is he always angry or no?"
"17206630","17209130"," Can't remember if he's angry or happy most of the time."
"17210330","17211230"," I can't remember. "
"17211230","17216350"," I said that's don't think that I'm calling him a mean or bad guy or something like that."
"17217170","17217710"," Who else?"
"17218010","17218410"," Druckenheimer?"
"17219070","17220070"," Yeah, he'd be a good one too."
"17220650","17221830"," Cullen would be a good one. "
"17222690","17223490"," Jamie DeMone."
"17224350","17225310"," You know it would be a good one?"
"17226790","17227490"," Jamie Diamond."
"17229910","17234730"," I could ask like an A.I. or something to make me and then I'll paint it or I'll have"
"17234730","17236490"," one of the kids paint asking one of them to paint it. "
"17236490","17239930"," But like Jamie Diamond for president would be cool as fuck."
"17241050","17242570"," Like just suck him off."
"17245570","17249430"," Because you know, you know how he wants to fuck and you know how he wants to be president. "
"17249790","17253450"," So just like putting that up there would be fucking law."
"17253610","17254750"," He'd probably watch the show."
"17255530","17260350"," Probably like take a snip and then like blow it up and he'd show it to his friends out in"
"17260350","17266110"," the Hamptons during Hanukkah or some shit or Christmas and be like, check this guy out painted me"
"17266110","17267070"," as running for president. "
"17267310","17268130"," Yucka yucka yucka yucka."
"17268250","17268530"," It's kidding."
"17270030","17272870"," But it would be funny to do him like running for president. "
"17274870","17276890"," Kathy would I like that idea too?"
"17277790","17278850"," Riding a sensuar?"
"17279210","17281090"," What if Kathy would was a sensuar?"
"17282090","17282650"," Sensuar."
"17284010","17284990"," It's like Jaguar."
"17289730","17292770"," I like the Kathy would sensuar too. "
"17292770","17298870"," Or what if we did like what if we did one that had like Kathy Woods as a sensuar and"
"17298870","17301870"," then Jamie Diamond's running for president or something like that."
"17302190","17303970"," Like a mashup of that stuff."
"17304110","17305390"," That would be kind of cool too. "
"17305710","17306570"," He'd be pissed at that."
"17306610","17308270"," He wouldn't want to be in the same painting as her."
"17310410","17311010"," Kathy's feet. "
"17311130","17311970"," Oh, that's terrible."
"17313470","17315470"," That's so terrible to be pissed."
"17318970","17319730"," Slob the knob. "
"17321670","17323770"," Yeah, Bill Ackman wants it too, doesn't he?"
"17323930","17325270"," You could put Bill Ackman on that painting."
"17326930","17329670"," You could do like Chamath, Kathy, Bill."
"17333130","17335030"," Do like an X-Men type painting. "
"17338290","17339570"," Yeah, I like Buffet too."
"17339890","17340490"," I like Buffet."
"17341610","17342790"," I think Buffet's a good one. "
"17343290","17343870"," I like Buffet."
"17343970","17347670"," If you were going to keep it straight face for like the first five or ten paintings."
"17348690","17349990"," I think Buffet would be a good one to do. "
"17350290","17350690"," I like that."
"17353480","17356600"," So Jamie stabbing a sword through sensuar Kathy Woods."
"17357020","17357840"," Holy shit. "
"17360200","17361720"," Kathy and Burry doing it."
"17364480","17366800"," Warren Buffett and Munger doing it together."
"17367200","17368460"," Imagine that would be a good one. "
"17368620","17371260"," Like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger making out."
"17371760","17373180"," That would be a really good one."
"17374920","17381240"," Charles Munger and like Buffet just like slapping lips and tongues together. "
"17383240","17387560"," In like a knocked over diet poke or something on like a cheap table."
"17389080","17389560"," Terrible."
"17390300","17391840"," I shouldn't even be saying that stuff. "
"17394380","17395860"," This is why they don't like you, Captain."
"17396440","17397460"," You're always making fun of evil."
"17402860","17404600"," The judges from the Muppets. "
"17410360","17411740"," With Bitcoin caps."
"17414420","17418020"," Oh, Jay Powell and labor and art cuddling in a pile of cash."
"17418540","17419900"," Oh, that's filthy too. "
"17420640","17423340"," I would take Jerome doing that with Nancy Pelosi."
"17425360","17431840"," I used to make a bunch of jokes about like Nancy Pelosi wearing the BDSM and like been like just"
"17431840","17434100"," beating up Jerome right before he makes a decision."
"17434100","17437580"," It's like a big, big red ball in his mouth with a choker on. "
"17440650","17445570"," He's like the power dynamic in that couple because you know those guys like that shit, right?"
"17446250","17447250"," You know they do."
"17447350","17447930"," You know these guys."
"17448090","17448630"," They love it. "
"17449230","17451490"," If you're a person, I'm going to tell you something."
"17451790","17458390"," If you're like a Jerome Powell, if you're a Bill Ackman, you're a Kathy Woods."
"17459150","17460150"," You're a Nancy Pelosi. "
"17460810","17462750"," You probably like BDSM."
"17463110","17464630"," You probably really like it."
"17465290","17467890"," Yeah, we don't think shame around these parts. "
"17473690","17476290"," She'm off just likes his legs to be made fun of."
"17477230","17478830"," He gets off on it."
"17482990","17485290"," Yeah, I'm all around for the markets in turmoil. "
"17485290","17492790"," Oh, did you ever see that?"
"17492890","17493290"," Okay."
"17493290","17495490"," So, Nito, you noticed that that was bear skin."
"17495750","17499050"," That's why I put that burnt Reynolds picture up. "
"17499410","17501250"," I don't think anyone noticed that it was a bear skin."
"17501330","17502330"," He was laying on naked."
"17508650","17512010"," I posted that burnt Reynolds picture and like nobody got it. "
"17512010","17514710"," And I was like, they didn't look closely on it."
"17515210","17517390"," It's like burnt Reynolds laying on a bear skin."
"17517670","17518550"," It's pretty gnarly. "
"17519010","17520510"," It's pretty, it's pretty filthy."
"17522090","17528130"," That bear skin probably stuck to probably smelled like if you guys don't know a lot of that's like"
"17528130","17533570"," what they used to what they used to preserve those pelt stinks."
"17533690","17534030"," It's gross. "
"17535310","17536270"," He didn't care."
"17536430","17537330"," He's all hairy and sweaty."
"17539650","17541270"," Yeah, that's from Playgirl. "
"17541430","17541570"," Exactly."
"17542010","17545430"," You guys know, you guys know burnt Reynolds naked from fucking Playgirl."
"17545670","17546890"," That's the pictures from Playgirl. "
"17547010","17547670"," I have some fucking lilies."
"17547870","17548710"," Some of you guys know what's up."
"17549450","17550290"," Some of you guys are dirty. "
"17556650","17557970"," You know what else would be a good one?"
"17558510","17560250"," Like if we're on the topic of these people."
"17562270","17563290"," It'd be good to do."
"17564610","17566290"," It'd be good to do Jim, man. "
"17566550","17567330"," It'd be good to do Jim Kramer."
"17567330","17569550"," I would do Jim Kramer."
"17569730","17571390"," He'd be a great, great picture. "
"17573330","17575270"," Still long calls here for this close."
"17576770","17581470"," I'm hoping that we squeeze into the bell so that I can put some protection on for Monday."
"17582310","17585330"," I'm going to try to buy some puts between four and four fifteen. "
"17586390","17587530"," Some dog shit."
"17588290","17590290"," Fifteen, five cent, three cent puts."
"17590570","17594610"," I like the Wednesday puts because they're really, really cheap. "
"17594810","17595750"," They're like three to five cents."
"17595750","17604650"," So I'm going to keep my eyeball at four p.m. Like four, four, fifteen for my eyeball on some"
"17604650","17606470"," puts for Wednesday."
"17606850","17608270"," I don't think I'm going to go with the Friday puts. "
"17608430","17609870"," I don't think I'm going to go with the Monday puts."
"17611270","17614350"," And I'm hoping to, I'm hoping I can get some positioning."
"17615370","17617590"," So we're going to watch this into the close. "
"17618730","17623350"," We're going to make sure that if we do squeeze up there that we're positioned right."
"17623350","17623470"," Right."
"17624270","17626330"," We don't want to be buying puts that right at this moment. "
"17626330","17629950"," We want to be catching him on the roll for catching him on a high."
"17631550","17632890"," Don't want to be buying him right here."
"17632950","17633470"," Maybe you do. "
"17633630","17636770"," Maybe you maybe you see a double top up here and you think we're going to roll right here."
"17636850","17637850"," I guess I could do that."
"17638030","17642110"," But personally that the target is or the boxes say and stay long here. "
"17642270","17644290"," So I'll wait until it says stay or get short."
"17646770","17648970"," Yeah, Jim Kramer was in play, girl, man."
"17649230","17650570"," Way back in 1942. "
"17652670","17655410"," When he returned from WW two."
"17657190","17659630"," Look at him trying to pin this clothes right now."
"17660350","17662630"," The gamma pin into the bell here. "
"17666680","17669900"," Yeah, I like I like the Wednesday puts the best."
"17670140","17673440"," I think that's my favorite one is the Wednesday put."
"17674200","17675020"," I like the Wednesday put. "
"17675100","17678180"," I really like the Friday puts, but they're pricey."
"17678500","17679520"," They're pretty expensive."
"17680360","17683940"," Like, so like right now I'm like, like for me. "
"17686320","17689620"," Like this is where this is where we need to go for me to lose."
"17691240","17694500"," So we need to go for me to lose right now."
"17694660","17695640"," We need to go below this. "
"17697240","17699240"," So we need to go below this yellow bar right here."
"17699300","17700580"," We need to go down there."
"17700720","17702340"," So I think I'm safe right now. "
"17704040","17708020"," Right now I'm safe, but if we start rolling down here."
"17709000","17711000"," I am not going to be safe, am I?"
"17712560","17714360"," So I'm feeling pretty good right now."
"17716260","17717680"," I feel I feel good. "
"17720510","17723030"," I'd be like shit, like I will say this."
"17724150","17726670"," What does suck about these trades is."
"17728310","17730770"," Like I'll be fine right now and happy. "
"17730950","17733210"," And then we'll come back and erase this entire move."
"17734030","17735710"," And I won't be happy again."
"17735730","17737750"," I'll be like fuck like they did this morning. "
"17741650","17744190"," They, they brought my calls all the way back to."
"17745750","17747290"," Retest on pre market."
"17747550","17749270"," So of course I'm in pre market and I'm like. "
"17750570","17751490"," These motherfuckers."
"17751490","17753390"," I'm like they're doing this shit and pre market."
"17753610","17755170"," I'm like, at least they didn't go below it. "
"17756370","17760130"," I'm like, that gives me some faith to the upside that they didn't go below it."
"17760670","17764410"," How do we broken below this morning on the pre market."
"17767830","17770010"," Bears would have had some fucking fun. "
"17770390","17775390"," I would have been in some deep shit like deep doodoo deep deep deep deep deep."

"17798370","17801910"," come back to fucking 430 and they're just like okay we're just gonna check to make sure that you're"
"17801910","17803370"," still holding."
"17804350","17805690"," I think I'm in at the bottom though."
"17805890","17806470"," I think I am. "
"17806810","17808490"," I think I am."
"17808550","17809530"," I think I'm in the bottom."
"17809730","17811410"," I think I might be with the eyes. "
"17812150","17813350"," Maybe with the cool kids here."
"17813630","17814350"," I'm hoping that I am."
"17820980","17823080"," Am I not getting YouTube comments?"
"17828580","17830220"," I'm not getting a lot of YouTube comments. "

"17906800","17908040"," He's not always right. "
"17908220","17908560"," He's wrong."
"17909340","17910180"," He can be right."
"17910380","17913920"," I just use him as a companion piece to trade against or with throughout the day. "
"17914780","17916740"," And talk about me somewhere in social media."

"17942860","17943440"," So how about that?"
"17943540","17944080"," Does that work?"
"17945840","17948480"," So I'd appreciate that if you did that heading into the clothes. "
"17948800","17952900"," Otherwise let's do a recap into the clothes right now before we end of the day."

"18029190","18030270"," And who else?"
"18034030","18037490"," If you're a podcaster, if you are an actual podcaster, give me a shout."
"18038110","18040350"," Reach out to me via DM and Twitter or something. "
"18041470","18046490"," If you're actually a podcaster in real life, if you're interested in doing that again, let me know."
"18047130","18049030"," I think that's all I got for notes this week."
"18049170","18050070"," You guys have any questions?"
"18051070","18052030"," Let me ask you a question. "

"18070110","18070690"," Let's see."
"18070810","18071170"," We're going to go. "
"18071630","18072570"," What am I going to switch to?"
"18072690","18074750"," We're going to switch to switch this trigger screen right here."
"18077630","18084330"," And if you have any questions, any requests that I can take care of for you for the next 10"
"18084330","18084670"," minutes."
"18090970","18092470"," Oh, you're a professional. "
"18092810","18093790"," You're a professional nerd."
"18096990","18099210"," Are you looking for 4300 by Wednesday?"
"18099910","18100950"," No, I am not."
"18102350","18103670"," No, no, sorry. "
"18104190","18106390"," You're looking at 4300 P for Wednesday."
"18106570","18113510"," I'm looking at some three cent puts for Wednesday on spy specifically because they're so cheap."
"18115150","18119430"," Own on Rivian needs some help for 28 P for Wednesday. "
"18120050","18120850"," So I've got time."
"18121050","18122350"," I'm going to wait until after the close."
"18123270","18124510"," To buy puts here. "
"18124690","18124890"," I'm not."
"18125050","18126610"," I don't trust this action at all."
"18127490","18128350"," Up or down. "
"18128490","18129150"," I don't trust it."
"18129290","18133030"," I think we can just as easily run straight up."
"18133310","18137810"," So I won't be placing a trade until after four PM. "
"18139430","18140090"," Own on."
"18140390","18140790"," Let me take it."
"18140890","18141550"," Oh, no. "
"18141810","18142530"," Oh, no."
"18142950","18143530"," Hold on a second here."
"18145470","18148130"," Let me see if I can take care of anything for you guys here. "
"18148370","18148570"," Oh, no."
"18148570","18150570"," Oh, and holdings."
"18151730","18152190"," Let's take a look. "
"18152410","18153650"," I'll keep it brief."
"18153930","18154110"," Okay."
"18155810","18157070"," I'll keep it brief currently. "
"18157470","18157910"," Price on."
"18158150","18160410"," Oh, no, and is above the hourly trigger."
"18161090","18168370"," It should look to retest 24 40 or 24.70 target to the upside though. "
"18168710","18173110"," This is a great ticker, by the way, target to the upside on any successful."
"18174790","18176190"," A successful retest."
"18177530","18181930"," You're going to have a target of 2809 and likely 29 43. "
"18182770","18187130"," An example on the back end here is you see the squeeze higher than the hourly trigger."
"18187730","18189350"," Notice how it did not hold."
"18189950","18195230"," So you need to see it hold and begin to trade higher to take that trade right there. "
"18195410","18195510"," Okay."
"18196010","18197250"," So you need to hold above."
"18198130","18203310"," Hold above 24 70 24 70 on ON ON. "
"18204250","18207970"," Hopefully you can jump on this trade down at 24 70."
"18208490","18209510"," What else we got out there?"
"18210390","18214030"," Rivian, our IVN like them right now too."
"18217110","18219770"," Rivian squeezing higher right now. "
"18220410","18222830"," Trying to regain the hourly trigger."
"18223230","18223850"," Rivian must."
"18224270","18224890"," Listen to me closely. "
"18224890","18227270"," Not bullish on Rivian just yet."
"18227690","18228330"," Nice turnaround."
"18229170","18231730"," Do not want to see Rivian reverse to the downside. "
"18232390","18232990"," Don't want to see that."
"18233430","18235290"," Be ticker money and run up here."
"18235810","18237770"," $19 17 cents. "
"18238110","18241150"," If price gets above and rechecks here, just like the other ticker."
"18241610","18251030"," You can reenter and begin to trade 1917 and preferably above 20, but I'll take 1917 for some"
"18251030","18256550"," attacking of $21 and 22, 42, 22, 42."
"18257090","18261770"," There's another target up on high of 2350 for Rivian. "
"18265450","18266570"," CRW D."
"18272110","18275310"," CRW D squeezing faces off."
"18276650","18278510"," Let me see here."
"18278510","18281130"," One minute chart, 30 minute chart. "
"18282430","18283630"," See what they're saying."
"18284550","18285850"," A bullish baby."
"18286650","18287170"," Bullish. "
"18288010","18290790"," A little bit of topping action going on on your daily velocity."
"18291590","18292710"," Not quite there yet."
"18293550","18296730"," It has more to go, but I'd be looking for a roll here coming up. "
"18297890","18299110"," So see it."
"18299230","18300430"," I love all this here."
"18300550","18301430"," I love all that shit. "
"18301570","18302090"," That's all beautiful."
"18303570","18304670"," You got one."
"18306890","18307370"," Stop. "
"18308250","18308730"," Stop."
"18309710","18311090"," Get rid of that thing."
"18312110","18313890"," I do like crowd here. "
"18314050","18315130"," Let me look closer at crowd."
"18322600","18324560"," Yeah, you want the rest of this, right?"
"18325280","18332860"," You got the targets above of 194.02 and you got the target above of $200."
"18333900","18338520"," I am going to tell you on CrowdStrike that you're likely going to get rolled there. "
"18338980","18340460"," So be careful, OK?"
"18341760","18347600"," You have a target above of 200 bucks and a rebuy in somewhere down here at 150."
"18348120","18349760"," So be really careful of this ticker."
"18350040","18351820"," But a lot of money to be made there in that one. "
"18351900","18352200"," I like it."
"18352320","18353060"," Good job on Crowd."
"18354580","18355660"," What else you got there?"
"18356220","18357620"," I love you guys. "
"18357840","18358660"," I got you guys."
"18358900","18358960"," Why?"
"18359800","18360280"," Hold on."
"18363530","18364350"," Joy, baby. "
"18364610","18365510"," What else we got going on here?"
"18365610","18366170"," This is a nice tick."
"18366350","18366730"," This is beautiful."
"18367210","18369250"," This looks super sexy. "
"18370090","18373030"," You had a huge capitulation of this ticker."
"18373270","18376330"," Awesome sauce consolidation down here."
"18376750","18378270"," Try in the squeeze higher. "
"18378830","18386330"," Hopefully we can get a squeeze to 46.08. I'm going to say something to you here."
"18386810","18389250"," If you're trading YY, I want to say something to you."
"18390430","18395430"," You likely get some rejection up here, but I want you to know something. "
"18396710","18399050"," If at any point you get above."
"18401110","18402330"," And can hold."
"18403890","18408490"," If at any point on YY, you can actually get above this quarter. "
"18408770","18409670"," Let this quarter here, 46."
"18411290","18412470"," 46 and change."
"18412810","18416450"," If you can get above that at any point and you start to see this stuff reverse. "
"18417570","18420250"," You're going to get a major upside move coming your way."
"18420450","18420930"," Major."
"18421410","18421730"," Major. "
"18422810","18423750"," This is a great ticker."
"18424630","18428130"," If you get if price gets above that quarterly and holds it price target."
"18428130","18428590"," You ready?"
"18430430","18432350"," This is kind of ridiculous here. "
"18435620","18436220"," $122."
"18437200","18441300"," Eventually it's going to take time, but it's going to take time."
"18441540","18442000"," But 46. "
"18442660","18444780"," This will go up 200%."
"18445440","18446440"," Good ticker."
"18446780","18447780"," Excellent ticker. "
"18448320","18448720"," YY."
"18449220","18450480"," Very good ticker."

"18461430","18466250"," Oh, did you guys are picking gangbuster tickers gangbustered."
"18467230","18467730"," Intel."
"18468850","18469930"," Same story. "
"18470870","18471310"," Intel."
"18472730","18474750"," Make and power moves here."
"18475990","18476610"," INTC. "
"18477630","18478930"," Same story."
"18479570","18481330"," Needs to break above this quarterly."
"18482350","18482830"," 38. "
"18483190","18483610"," 18."
"18483810","18484550"," See how it didn't hold?"
"18484970","18496820"," If it does squeeze up there and can hold itself together long enough long enough"
"18496820","18500360"," for the weekly, the daily to come above and break above here and grind."
"18501660","18503480"," You're going to see some explosive moves. "
"18503720","18507880"," You're going to see like 42 bucks, but then it's going to it's going to blast up."
"18507880","18513080"," It's going to hit 46 45 51 51 at a target of 60."
"18515500","18516800"," You might only get. "
"18519670","18520950"," That one right there."
"18521090","18522310"," How about $52."
"18523170","18524490"," I'll give you $52. "
"18526030","18527990"," But I in TC looks great."
"18528570","18529830"," I like that one a ton."
"18533330","18534450"," Yeah, man. "
"18534830","18536750"," The holding for 200 bucks, definitely."

"18585310","18588190"," As long as the daily trigger is held."
"18590600","18593210"," Forty one or four forty one twenty two."
"18593830","18599670"," Expect a resumption of trading to the upside price target. "
"18601150","18603170"," Holy shit price target."
"18603890","18606850"," I know you think it's 500, but it's not."

"18670860","18672280"," This shit is going to bash. "
"18673880","18675820"," Something like that and then like this."
"18677580","18679600"," Like be really careful here."
"18679720","18680100"," This is great. "
"18680840","18682600"," NVDA looks fucking beautiful."
"18683340","18684980"," Selling off into the bell right now."
"18685480","18686560"," Let's go back to spy. "
"18686820","18688280"," I've still got calls on to this close."
"18688700","18689780"," They're taking them for a ride."

"18715580","18716540"," This is not good."
"18716660","18719360"," I don't like seeing this in this close. "
"18719380","18721920"," They're parking it right on that weekly trigger."
"18722380","18725420"," Trying to set up that nasty close come Monday morning."
"18726060","18729020"," Make sure you are well hedged into Monday. "
"18729720","18732920"," Promise me that that you're going to remain well hedged into Monday."
"18732960","18734740"," This is not what you want to be seeing."

"18751510","18754090"," I got to buy some puts for Monday."
"18755150","18755930"," Or for Wednesday. "
"18785810","18794690"," Four or six P's I like bouncing right now off that weekly trigger."

"18810400","18811580"," Look at that bounce right there."
"18811740","18814920"," These sneaky little guys in here bouncing off that weekly trigger."
"18817200","18822720"," I'm going to hold off here till 4.15. Still long calls here too. "
"18824920","18826340"," They're still worthless right now."
"18826440","18827280"," They're fucking at zero."
"18828760","18831440"," I've got calls at 4.32. They're still at fucking zero. "
"18831680","18832620"," I still have them on there."
"18833020","18834100"," They're below zero."
"18834580","18835140"," Below one. "
"18836020","18837620"," They're not even offering me a penny right now."
"18837700","18838260"," They're like fuck you."
"18838340","18839040"," We're not going up there. "
"18840300","18845320"," I got some 4.06 P's set up for the 11th."
"18847780","18851340"," I haven't bought them yet, but I'm going to wait until 430C where we are."
"18851940","18854560"," So I'll try to do it like 4.14 or something like that. "
"18856480","18858060"," Yeah, you see that hitting right now?"
"18859600","18862700"," I hope my butt hole is actually sore today."
"18863120","18863860"," It's actually sore."
"18864000","18866880"," I feel I feel pain from them fucking with it yesterday. "
"18867760","18871100"," Like it feels like it feels like I got fucked in the ass."
"18871300","18872420"," Nothing I've ever been fucked in the ass."
"18872580","18873380"," Not that it's a bad thing. "
"18873800","18875620"," If you like getting fucked in the ass, that's cool."
"18876400","18877640"," I've never been fucked in the ass."
"18877800","18880260"," I got fucked in the ass yesterday by a medical professional. "
"18880500","18880740"," It sucked."
"18881700","18882580"," It was not fun."
"18883620","18884400"," There was no joy. "
"18885640","18887100"," Left a bad taste in my mouth."
"18892360","18892880"," It's true."
"18893360","18894080"," It's true story. "
"18898760","18901920"," I had a doctor stick his fingers at my butt yesterday."
"18902580","18903600"," It was not good."
"18905780","18907160"," It wasn't used to it. "
"18909460","18911400"," They did lube me up though, so I'm grateful."
"18921080","18924840"," I went to the doctor yesterday and they finally let me get a colonoscopy."
"18924940","18928540"," They're like, okay, let's stick a finger of your butt and find out if you actually do want that"
"18928540","18929220"," colonoscopy. "
"18929360","18930260"," That's exactly what happened."
"18930440","18931000"," I was like, fuck."
"18931800","18933540"," It starts sticking fingers up my butt hole. "
"18934160","18934740"," It's like dead."
"18936060","18938700"," When I was in the army, they stuck their finger at my butt hole."
"18938700","18941220"," It was like one finger leaning over. "
"18942280","18943240"," This wasn't like that."
"18943420","18944320"," This was like lay down."
"18944820","18947140"," They were like pull your knee up to your chest. "
"18948300","18949660"," They were like lie over on your side."
"18949840","18951820"," I felt like a wounded deer."
"18952860","18956000"," I felt like a deer in the side of the river. "
"18956400","18959020"," They were like, should we just put them down right now?"
"18960700","18961580"," That's how I felt."
"18970480","18971460"," It's too story."
"18972540","18975380"," Dude, I'll tell you guys everything that happens to me. "
"18976520","18978580"," Oh, good guess what else?"
"18979480","18982740"," I'm supposed to do that underground fight is tonight."
"18983760","18985380"," Shit, I haven't called my buddy."
"18985560","18987280"," I'm supposed to go to an underground fight tonight too. "
"18987840","18988420"," I totally forgot."
"18988600","18989320"," I'm supposed to go to an underground."
"18989320","18990600"," I was supposed to go last weekend. "
"18991360","18992920"," But I think he told me it was this weekend."
"18993140","18993700"," I had the wrong date."
"18993780","18994320"," He had the wrong date. "
"18994320","18995240"," He told me the wrong date."
"18995520","18997240"," So I might be dead by morning."
"18998780","19000500"," I'm going to like an underground fight club. "
"19002180","19003120"," That's all true too."
"19005760","19007080"," Oh, man, I'm totally fucked."

"19026840","19032800"," If you're watching this show and you've left angry in the past and you're still watching this show"
"19032800","19035760"," day in and day out and you're like, God, cap doesn't like me."

"19179800","19181380"," Say, it's been nice to meet you."
"19183040","19187840"," I have to go do something else right now, but can I give you my phone number?"

"19222280","19222920"," Not weirdo. "
"19223020","19224460"," They can call you if they want."
"19224640","19225620"," They think you're weirdo."
"19225660","19226780"," They don't have to call you back. "
"19227700","19228880"," You give them your number."
