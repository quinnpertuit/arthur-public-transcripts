"380","2120"," Let's welcome in the founder of Appaloosa Management."
"2440","3300"," Now, David, welcome back."
"3440","4360"," Thanks so much for being with us. "
"5120","5760"," How are you doing?"
"6160","6580"," I'm good."
"6940","7320"," I'm good."
"7440","11660"," It's great to have you, especially at a time where stocks are basically hanging around record"
"11660","12020"," highs. "
"12740","14860"," The 10-year, the yield's been ticking up."
"15239","16860"," I said it touched 170 earlier."
"17160","17980"," It's dropped a little bit back. "
"18140","19600"," Do you like the equity market here?"
"19600","25510"," Do you mean like I like you, Scott, or are you talking about like on a personal basis?"
"26250","29190"," Personal, professional, however you want to characterize it, David?"
"30090","34630"," Look, I like it as a long-term instrument that I think everybody needs in their portfolio."
"37830","38330"," Okay."
"38330","46350"," Do you like it for the risk reward right now in stocks given where valuations are relative to where"
"46350","46850"," rates are?"
"48390","52910"," As a trader, trader, you're asking me, as a trader or as an investor, Scott?"
"56450","57310"," Hello, traders. "
"58030","62050"," Captain Jim James here with your daily brief for the week of Thanksgiving."
"62990","67290"," So this is going to be an interesting video for the upcoming week."
"67290","72470"," Looking at the screen or here, you can see that we have the Fed Chair. "
"72830","77310"," We know that the Fed Chair will be announced at some point this week before Thanksgiving."
"78030","83990"," If the Fed Chair was nominated and anyone thought that the nomination would disrupt the markets,"
"83990","89550"," that that nomination would take place over the weekend or outside of market hours."
"89550","96630"," The longer that we don't hear who the Fed Chair is, the more likely it becomes J-POW. "
"96890","102510"," Now, I did post on Twitter that Lael Bernard would also be very positive for the market."
"103390","109130"," You should still look at the bear case for Lael Bernard if she's nominated."
"109130","118910"," Have some concern in that as when you look back in history on changes to the Fed Chair, they can"
"118910","123270"," become the hatchet men, even if they are perceived as bullish. "
"123770","124790"," So just keep that in mind."
"124950","127789"," And she is considered overly bullish for the stock market."
"127789","135750"," But if it's not J-POW and it is Bernard, it's possible like Carter did with Vocalar back in the,"
"136050","138190"," I think it was 79 or E."
"138570","145610"," He was anticipated to be dovish, but in reality Carter wanted inflation to move down so he would"
"145610","146390"," win reelection. "
"147270","148390"," Now that didn't work out for him."
"149150","152530"," So I don't know how that impacts this time around, right?"
"152530","153850"," But keep that in mind."
"154410","159750"," I think the reaction with Bernard is going to be positive for the market, but with the market"
"159750","161550"," doesn't like his uncertainty. "
"161710","165190"," They don't care if the uncertainty is positive or negative."
"165530","167950"," They really like status quo."
"168770","170090"," So consider that with Bernard. "
"170430","175370"," The rest of them are pretty much dovish except for Bostick and there's a couple others."
"176350","179330"," That would be bearish for the market."
"179710","186150"," But I would expect if he got a bearish Fed Chair nomination, it would have happened this past"
"186150","186490"," weekend. "
"186990","194550"," Or if we don't tear anything on what by Wednesday, they might be saving a bearish or even something"
"194550","198370"," that could disrupt the market for Thursday or on the weekend."
"199630","201790"," Thanksgiving or the weekend coming up."
"202190","206630"," Even if it's anything, anybody other than Jay Powell, they're probably going to save it for"
"206630","208990"," Thursday or the weekend or non trading hours. "
"209370","217570"," Jay Powell is, we are, we have, we are pricing in rates for the Jay Powell plan, right?"
"217930","222290"," So if he gets redominated or if he's given the seat, right?"
"222290","230630"," And it's the status quo and the market should be the least disruptive with the plan that we are on"
"230630","230990"," right now."
"231370","239510"," The idea behind Bernard being disruptive to the market on the upside is that they were, did float"
"239510","240050"," this week."
"240210","246490"," There was news floated around the country this week that they could possibly push off a rate"
"246490","246810"," increase. "
"246810","254110"," Now, if we've priced in rates coming into 2022, they better believe that we're going to get that"
"254110","254950"," green bar up."
"255610","258190"," Or it's even if not now at some point down the road."
"258470","260730"," So anyways, just keep that in mind as we move forward this week. "
"260990","267470"," The next thing to consider this week is what major news we have on the economic calendar."
"268270","272370"," And really the one that you should be looking at this week is personal income."
"273030","275290"," That's the one that you want to be focused on. "
"276050","280590"," Some inflation is important, but personal income is going to be a big one for this week on"
"280590","280950"," Wednesday."
"281750","283630"," And the docket on Wednesday is quite large."
"284110","288590"," This can create some volatility in the market as we move forward. "
"289450","292850"," So I'm unsure if it will create a drop in the market this week."
"293590","296590"," Now I did, I did try to hint at this video over the course of the weekend."
"296590","305610"," I think some people got which week we're in incorrect that this is the 47th week is a down week"
"305610","306730"," in reality. "
"307770","316290"," Time data graphs are typically done on a European system and they differ from the US system this"
"316290","316510"," year."
"316890","323270"," The 47th week was last week and we were down even though the indexes are up last week."
"323850","328370"," So if you were to look at any of the data or charts in the US for where we are"
"328370","332790"," and how this week should turn out, we should be in the 48th week, which is one of the best"
"332790","334590"," weeks in the year. "
"334670","337390"," I think it is the best week in the year."
"339690","342090"," Now, I'm going to talk briefly before we get into the charts."
"342150","347550"," I want to talk briefly about what's going on in the markets to give you some idea of what's"
"347550","347910"," happening. "
"348930","353270"," So we had a trade that took place in May."
"353770","355610"," It was May of 2020."
"356230","358970"," And that was the COVID trade, the stay at home trade. "
"359510","363210"," Those trades are being wrapped up right now."
"363490","363550"," Okay."
"364650","370190"," And those really do affect a lot of the tech and long hold type of stocks, right?"
"370450","373090"," These are stocks that you buy and you hold them for long periods of time. "
"373770","375290"," They're not really, they're not real goods."
"375290","383550"," Now, as they wrap up these trades, some bad news is coming out from some of these these trades,"
"383950","384050"," right?"
"384610","386930"," So you're seeing some of the hours come out."
"387090","390170"," They're terrible, even though these stocks were pumped up. "
"390530","393870"," These include things like PayPal, pins, Disney."
"394510","396330"," Snap was some weird news, right?"
"396330","399450"," Well, some of it was payment or advertising."
"399970","401670"," So you start to see it. "
"402370","406610"," I've heard this argument on the internet that it's like tax loss harvesting."
"407030","407730"," That's all bullshit."
"408130","412650"," These are banks that are taking profits and that trade off the table. "
"413190","417690"," Now, the only tax loss harvesting that's being done is by you as the bag holder."
"418210","418230"," Okay."
"418790","420670"," So this trade is ending. "
"421210","423870"," And what you're looking for is the whole picture."
"423870","430870"," So you're seeing the trade ending and stocks that are being dumped currently in stocks that are"
"430870","432070"," being pushed up."
"432490","437190"," So if you look at like an Apple per se, they were stagnant for an entire year. "
"437850","441350"," So they're pushing the Apple up, right?"
"441610","445970"," They're pushing Apple way up to call profits from that investment that they had."
"446490","447590"," Same thing goes for Tesla."
"448470","451210"," Some of the dumping that took place in Facebook. "
"451990","453610"," Same thing is going on with Amazon."
"454470","461610"," So you got to see this culling of profit from some of these long hold stocks that didn't actually"
"461610","462590"," go up, right?"
"462810","465390"," They kind of traded sideways in the big scheme of things."
"465830","468790"," And the ones that did go crazy are starting to sell off. "
"469110","476290"," Now, I do believe at some point in 2022, like everybody else, that tech will sell off to some"
"476290","476630"," extent."
"476630","480510"," You're still going to get interest in some of the big name tech stocks."
"480750","483790"," You'll see like the apples and the Amazon's, they'll be fine or whatever. "
"484050","489210"," But you are going to see this trade from 2020 kill some of these stocks."
"490050","494370"," And the trade that's coming into 2022 is going to be real goods."
"494810","500210"," You're going to be looking for some growth tech, but you're also really going to be looking for is"
"500210","503530"," that small to mid cap demand stocks. "
"503530","509310"," So start thinking about real goods that you can't have right now, but you will buy once the"
"509310","510110"," shortages end."
"510390","516750"," So let's say you can't have your house built with your stocks that will have high demand for the"
"516750","520789"," next two or three years, especially if the market starts to go sideways or down."
"521090","525110"," Start to look at any of these real goods that you're going to get for yourself, your family"
"525110","527390"," members, a loved one or for your children. "
"527390","530270"," And especially if you can't get them right now."
"530470","535030"," Another trade is going to be instead of focusing on EV companies."
"535990","543950"," The trade is still alive to go after the materials and services and parts that go under the cars. "
"544730","551130"," You're going to be a winner over time more consistently than you are with some some EV companies."
"551590","555390"," So we'll talk about this more down the road as as the year ends."
"555390","557550"," And this goes back to some of my previous videos. "
"557550","561830"," I talked to you about calling your stock portfolios."
"562590","565530"," I think I asked told you to do that a month or two ago."
"566290","571130"," And then told me play individual stocks or indexes as we head into this season. "
"571510","574950"," Had you done this because I hear other people out there saying I shouldn't have sold my Apple"
"574950","578270"," stock, you should most definitely should have sold your Apple stock."
"578770","579730"," Taking your profit."
"580170","585010"," And then you play short trades, short time trades from now. "
"585570","587730"," And there's a famous trader that talked about this."
"588170","592010"," I forget, I always forget his name, but he was he owns a football team."
"592250","598070"," And he's part of GS and trader for GS for a long time, but he talks about the same thing,"
"598190","598270"," right?"
"598650","599870"," You pull your money off the table. "
"600370","603310"," And then at this point, we're going to drive the market up as high as it can."
"603310","609130"," Take our profits and take our money off the rest of our money off table as this this cycle ends."
"609170","609610"," Okay. "
"609830","617550"," Do you like it for the risk reward right now in stocks given where valuations are relative to where"
"617550","618690"," rates are?"
"619890","623610"," As a trader trader, you're asking me as a trader or as an investor."
"623950","628290"," You pull your money off the table and then at this point, we're going to drive the market up as"
"628290","628990"," high as it can."
"628990","635310"," Take our profits and take our money off the rest of our money off the table as this this cycle"
"635310","635590"," ends. "
"635650","636070"," Okay."
"637110","638450"," All this has been laid out."
"640170","640770"," It's important. "
"641230","642590"," Anyways, I'm just going to pass all that."
"642830","643810"," There's no need to discuss that here."
"644150","645250"," Point, though, is this. "
"646930","652550"," You should have cash ready to deploy for 2022 and beyond, right?"
"652550","658150"," You should be looking towards IWM, the ROT, the Russell, RTY."
"658470","666430"," You want to see that last sell off in small caps so we can take small caps long into the"
"666430","666790"," new year."
"667450","676550"," And for the rest of the year, I would say to you that we're going to run up NQ and"
"676550","678010"," specific stocks. "
"678010","685110"," So if you follow me on YouTube and you don't follow me on Twitter, come find me just Google search,"
"685410","687370"," Captain James, follow me there."
"687810","692850"," Set the alerts in your Twitter account or create a Twitter account."
"693730","694390"," Set your alerts. "
"695170","702010"," I'm going to try to limit how much I tweet and what I will do is focus on whichever stock"
"702010","703270"," is pumping the market."
"703270","709930"," So if Amazon's pumping one day or if Apple's pumping one day, whatever stock is driving the market,"
"709930","714990"," we'll try to focus on jumping on that train for the day, right?"
"715170","719430"," We'll get in on some plays and we'll ride that up."
"720070","721990"," Same thing would go for it. "
"722110","727550"," Or if you're scared about where the market's headed, you can always trade the spy or the cues."
"727550","735190"," But if you're looking to capture the most money as the market starts to go vertical, just follow me"
"735190","735410"," on Twitter."
"736030","741810"," That's what I've been doing the past month or so and it's been very profitable. "
"742290","746070"," It should leave you with a nice end of the year gift."
"746350","749550"," One last thing would be the danger in the market right now."
"749550","751050"," I always talk about how much you're risking. "
"751130","753430"," It's like 10%, 20%, 30%."
"753430","758290"," You're taking on risk or how to take on risk, even if the market were to fail."
"759530","765290"," That you're able to accumulate lots of money and only lose small amounts as we make those moves up. "
"766750","770310"," And the last thing would be the whole market crash scenario."
"770310","771370"," I just don't see it."
"771730","773250"," I don't see it. "
"773250","781370"," I think even if we corrected, let's say 20, 30%, that's not a market crash to me for where we"
"781370","781950"," are right now."
"782110","783870"," The past couple of years have been outstanding."
"785910","788470"," All my trades now, I don't hold any long term stock. "
"789190","794950"," I don't have anything that I own that I'm looking out to hold it from right now until three years"
"794950","795490"," from now."
"796190","802030"," I will wait for that as we head into December and January to make those trades."
"802030","805950"," I'm looking for the top and then queue and spy. "
"806130","811390"," That's the top, but that winter top that happens every single year seasonally."
"812250","818990"," And then I'm also looking for where the banks are going to deploy their money seasonally where we"
"818990","819630"," are right now."
"820630","824350"," Okay, so I'm going to just show you the spy chart for tonight. "
"824830","828370"," I was going to show you some other charts, but in reality, what you really need to know is the"
"828370","829530"," spy chart, the spy chart."
"829530","835710"," Or yeah, we're showing you the yes chart, but the spy chart, the yes chart SPX really does give an"
"835710","836890"," idea where the market is."
"836970","839510"," Okay, the general health of the market where the markets going. "
"839970","844270"," And we're going to talk about the spot because it's going to, it's going to encapsulate where the"
"844270","845470"," mark where the market is."
"845770","849710"," Even though item is going down, the market is still healthy by what spy is showing."
"852850","856750"," And we're going to probably trade the spy the cues this week. "
"857790","863710"," And we're also going to trade those individual stocks, right, as they come up as that gamma comes"
"863710","865070"," into those stocks will trade those."
"865550","871310"," Now, I talked in my last video to that people were looking at like RSI indicators, all kinds of"
"871310","872910"," different goofy fucking indicators."
"873430","877050"," Sorry for swearing, but people check all these indicators and say, well, it's oversold. "
"877970","878430"," It's over this."
"879130","882550"," It's outside of its trading bands, it's bullinger bands, blah, blah, blah."
"882550","889850"," In reality, like I said, they're trying to get themselves back into this channel, if not create a"
"889850","891070"," new channel for end of the year. "
"891970","893770"," We'll put that new channel in over here."
"895010","898430"," You should just reset your indicators if you could, but you can't, right?"
"898790","900370"," We fought our way back in this trading channel."
"900650","905410"," I think we're trying to even fight into a steeper trading channel right now. "
"906610","909650"," But this is where some indicators really do suck."
"909830","911070"," They give false readings."
"911470","911650"," Okay. "
"912790","916630"," I also, sorry for the noise in the background."
"917050","921610"," I have some family hair, some down by my basement's washroom and all that kind of stuff."
"922390","923430"," I'm going to burn this in basement. "
"923810","924850"," I'm not in my office today."
"925110","930070"," The thing to know is this, okay, is that spy is up right now."
"930230","932270"," Okay, it's probably going to continue to go up. "
"932270","936490"," In this period, we're from now until Friday."
"936910","943210"," The markets in general and specific stocks should go to some pretty wild games this week."
"943470","945090"," We're going to bring this down a little bit closer. "
"945810","949710"," I would expect some weakness in the market after Friday."
"950090","952730"," You also have to be concerned about the volume in the market."
"953270","955790"," Volume's going to go away. "
"957050","961150"," So let's say you took some calls on Monday and you wanted to hold them."
"961850","963490"," Straight through through into Friday."
"964550","969930"," I would recommend, hold on, let me get my whiskey here and have a little sip as it's Thanksgiving"
"969930","970430"," week. "
"974340","983760"," So as we head into Friday with the volume dropping off, it'll be tough to hold calls"
"983760","985600"," through Thursday into Friday."
"985600","986480"," They might not print."
"987640","991620"," So if you're going to hold our week, it might recommend some spreads. "
"992680","998140"," And that way you don't have to deal with that volume drop off or just trade each day."
"998300","1001860"," You could trade Monday into, let's say, Tuesday end of day."
"1002680","1009460"," And then you could also pick some FDs up from, let's say, end of close of Wednesday into Friday, in"
"1009460","1011540"," case Friday is like a mind-blower. "
"1011640","1012640"," It goes to the roof, right?"
"1013060","1018480"," And anyways, so that's what my plan is, is to day trade it and then hold some FDs over each"
"1018480","1020300"," night from day to day."
"1020300","1023000"," Now, let's look at where support is, okay?"
"1024300","1027280"," There are people that are calling for doom and gloom."
"1028180","1031339"," And that's right down here at 45, 46, right?"
"1031540","1032520"," We've dropped off originally. "
"1033579","1040220"," And we know that we have some, some decent support here because as we sold off, we bounced right on"
"1040220","1043359"," this, this trend channel, this channel, this established respected channel."
"1043960","1047780"," We've had all year long, actually since 2020, you know, we've got a good bounce here."
"1048460","1049940"," We've got another bounce up here. "
"1050420","1051280"," We'll get a little bit closer."
"1055830","1059550"," We're going to put some support right over here."
"1061550","1065290"," This was the Tuesday low of last week. "
"1065330","1066890"," I talked about this low back here."
"1067610","1070230"," And this is the swing, swing low from last week."
"1071210","1073410"," And you'll have another swing low here. "
"1073790","1075730"," Well, no, the next swing low will be shown."
"1075890","1078470"," It'll be somewhere pair, actually, because we're what the trend is."
"1078810","1080830"," Remember, the trend is your friend, right?"
"1080830","1082930"," Don't fight the trend until it's changes. "
"1083690","1085770"," So we did have the swing low last week down here."
"1085770","1087330"," That was at 46, 68."
"1087730","1091790"," And our close on Friday was, this was right here. "
"1091890","1093490"," I put this line in already on Friday."
"1094070","1096930"," So this would be the deepest, I'm bullish."
"1097350","1102330"," So in my view, this would be the deepest that we're going to go on Monday, 46, 91, 25. "
"1103230","1108030"," We'll come back out to the month view real quick, take the auto off."
"1108030","1112390"," And we know that this is Friday right here."
"1112730","1113990"," We know the top of this channel. "
"1114030","1116310"," Now, I want to show you something here in a minute, okay?"
"1116450","1120510"," So this is where we should be shooting for."
"1120630","1122770"," We know we have some resistance above here."
"1123650","1124650"," You see that resistance?"
"1125490","1127170"," And we know that we're shooting to come up here. "
"1127530","1131310"," One thing you want to be looking for is that as we start to make our way up, you're going"
"1131310","1134650"," to be taking these trades all the way up once we break through and hold."
"1135210","1140050"," Or you're going to take the trade off at each resistance point, and then you're going to put the"
"1140050","1144490"," trade back on so we can run this all the way up into the top of this channel."
"1144910","1147450"," I do want to go back and show you something real quick here, okay?"
"1148970","1149670"," That's interesting. "
"1150810","1155970"," And someone pointed this out on Twitter, I think."
"1157450","1159530"," I remember who, but some pointed this out."
"1159530","1167890"," And I like this because I have projections of 5100, not 5,000, 5100. "
"1168510","1170750"," So we're going to look at that real quick."
"1173000","1175340"," And then we're going to go back to what we were talking about."
"1175480","1176480"," Oh, I already have it up there. "
"1176740","1176880"," Okay."
"1177360","1183380"," So we are going to start to talk about the possibility of this happening."
"1186620","1188820"," We're just going to make this real brief here. "
"1190040","1191940"," This is going to panic some people."
"1191940","1196780"," And in reality, there's good reason for us to go here."
"1197300","1204930"," This would destroy bears and, oh, I got this one wrong here. "
"1211320","1212500"," Got this one wrong."
"1214710","1215970"," It's something like this."
"1219270","1231510"," See if I can get this right here or right"
"1231510","1231770"," there. "
"1235040","1236000"," Something like this."
"1236580","1237460"," This is possible."
"1238960","1242780"," It could even, see where's that tag right there. "
"1246810","1248190"," It could even use this one right here."
"1252680","1260000"," Now, a channel like this is possible where we bounce or even tag up here."
"1260220","1266000"," Maybe we tag up here at this 480, come back down for a week or two in early December. "
"1266780","1267820"," And we actually move up."
"1268100","1270900"," This 5100 is January 18."
"1271840","1273180"," This is possible. "
"1274200","1275280"," Keep this on your plate."
"1276180","1281140"," If you're a bear, I would be real concerned about us moving up here."
"1281140","1283100"," Into January. "
"1283540","1291460"," If this channel shows itself, if we jump over this 4800 and start going sideways here, we could"
"1291460","1296740"," make one last extension up and then start to sell off into mid January."
"1297580","1299860"," So think about this right here as we move forward."
"1300540","1302860"," And I think you can even see it. "
"1305260","1305840"," Let's see here."
"1308520","1314160"," So if you're ultra bullish, you're going to look for a jump above this channel here."
"1314160","1318740"," And if we start to ride this all the way up, it's weird too. "
"1319180","1321520"," It doesn't actually have to look that crazy."
"1322120","1329540"," If you were to get up into this new trading channel, we just slowly grinded into January."
"1330660","1332100"," There would be two things that would happen. "
"1332420","1333120"," Bulls would be too scared."
"1333480","1334280"," So they're not in the market."
"1334980","1336380"," It means they'll totally thanks to the market. "
"1336800","1342480"," And retail bears and probably some retail bulls would fuel this run up with low volume into"
"1342480","1343100"," January."
"1343100","1346660"," So anyways, that's all I've got for you for Thanksgiving."
"1347600","1351260"," I just want to highlight briefly real quick the plan going forward. "
"1351700","1354860"," If you follow me, if you don't, try to follow me."
"1355580","1362700"," I will attempt to track specific stocks that are moving the market as we go up."
"1363800","1368480"," And I will focus on them so that you have plays that you can make. "
"1369460","1375440"," And then I will also be trading the spy or the queues actively each day."
"1375780","1380360"," And I'll try to limit my posts during trading hours."
"1381440","1387120"," The ship hosting or the busting balls and all that kind of stuff so that we can make a bonus,"
"1387400","1387520"," right?"
"1387760","1388940"," Make a holiday bonus. "
"1389580","1390420"," See you all out there tomorrow."
"1390960","1391400"," Happy Thanksgiving. "
