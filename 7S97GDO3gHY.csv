"46130","47030"," Good morning, all."
"47310","50290"," Good morning, Neil, Charles, Angie, Spencer, Benjamin, Emma, Ammon."
"57050","57810"," Good morning, Robert. "
"61520","61960"," Good morning."
"62080","69280"," Good morning, everybody."
"79820","80700"," How are y'all doing this morning?"
"109220","110020"," Time to digest. "
"128820","130000"," How's everybody this morning?"
"138420","139380"," Everybody is doing well."
"139380","145140"," I hope some of you guys are able to buy the IWM or the spy yesterday."
"145520","150260"," I hope some of you bears that are out there took guidance and decided to wait in case we gapped"
"150260","150780"," up today. "
"152360","155320"," You would be doing very well this morning if that was the case."
"155960","158340"," Hope everybody is doing well and think of a look back and see."
"162160","167800"," Yeah, we talked about, we talked about everything, or we talked about yesterday towards the close. "
"169120","176200"," There's a chance that we would gap up today and it's not quite a gap up, but it's definitely not"
"176200","177200"," selling off, right?"
"178640","181940"," We're all the bearishness that we were failing yesterday."
"182860","187760"," Into the close, the opposite argument is, you know, everything looks so strong right now and in no"
"187760","192640"," way is a bearish and it's actually dangerous to be taking a position in the overnight."
"193520","196020"," Tesla is not doing so well right now at this moment. "
"196920","200600"," I want you all, if you're paying, or if you're here because of Tesla, I do want to talk to"
"200600","204100"," you about where we are right now with Tesla."
"204620","206460"," Yesterday there was that Venerali, right?"
"206580","210120"," We had that beautiful Venerali from Friday into close on Monday."
"211000","218820"," Today I would expect, you know, with the Venerali being done, volatility going down, I would expect"
"218820","222380"," some trading sideways in a slow move up possibly. "
"222740","227520"," We could trade down, you know, usually you'll see a move like this in Tesla and then we trade down"
"227520","228960"," for a few days and another move up."
"229040","232220"," If we're in trend, we could trade up today."
"232360","237360"," We'll check the book map this morning right up the gate and see if we're selling or buying. "
"237800","241180"," My assumption is that we put this on a larger timeframe."
"243100","245840"," You often see these moves, see this nice move on Tesla."
"246520","250520"," I guess the expectation would be we do one, two, and you see the third move up, right?"
"250660","252160"," You go one, two, and then three. "
"252740","254240"," Nice three day pump on Tesla."
"254820","256560"," That's possible if that takes place today at the bell."
"257959","259779"," I'm not going to say no to that. "
"260180","265440"," This morning before we start the day, I do want you to realize that at 10 a.m. we have"
"265440","267260"," ISM manufacturing."
"267640","269240"," We've got job openings and quits."
"269900","279060"," We've got, I don't, I think Neil, Neil, Fed President Neil Kaskari is not a bull or a bear. "
"279280","282460"," I could be wrong on that but I don't think that he is ultra bear."
"283560","289200"," But we do have some volatility that could be introduced into the market around 10 a.m. this"
"289200","289480"," morning."
"290700","300560"," I still don't think it's as important to say as the COVID news or"
"300560","302280"," when that becomes important again, right?"
"303020","305280"," When we figure out that our overcrowd is not so bad. "
"306040","308480"," So there could be some weakness today in Tesla."
"309380","315060"," We might be looking for 117554 as possibly by the dip."
"315240","316680"," We might just green bar straight up today. "
"317380","320700"," I think 1252 was with the next level for Tesla."
"322200","323580"," So you pay attention to Tesla."
"324440","326360"," That's the important thing for you to be looking at. "
"326640","329800"," Outside of that, the spy this morning before the bell rings will get into it."
"329800","334960"," I'm going to change some of these levels and update them so that they reflect what we're looking"
"334960","335660"," for today."
"335660","342180"," We know that the cashback for yesterday while the low on the cashback for two days ago was down"
"342180","342780"," here, right?"
"343580","345040"," Sometimes you go two days back. "
"345500","348860"," The lowest that we would probably go today would be 470."
"349200","351060"," 470 is still in bull's control."
"351860","356500"," I would expect no less than 475 or excuse me. "
"356500","361420"," Yeah, 470 but in reality for today with the volatility going down."
"361420","363200"," We might get some volatility at 10."
"363500","366040"," Let's say we trade down to this new support here. "
"366240","371640"," Remember, I got to move this little volatility symbol here and that's because we broke through"
"371640","372040"," volatility."
"372760","380540"," And once we break through volatility like this, you start to create a new support zone here and for"
"380540","382280"," us to attempt to trade higher."
"382740","388800"," So because we did gap up over the night, we're going to be looking for a target of 41 or"
"388800","392120"," 48148 and 48251. "
"392780","394320"," We have a much higher target yesterday."
"394740","397660"," I think the target yesterday was 4869."
"398380","400700"," That was early in the morning we saw that yesterday. "
"401440","405420"," So we're going to take a look at the levels again today and adjust these to what BookMap says once"
"405420","405940"," the bell rings."
"405940","410300"," I've got some other levels that I'm going to put on here as well so that you can see where"
"410300","411400"," the volatility zones are."
"411540","415740"," We're positive gamma negative gamma is so we can day trade this today. "
"416300","422880"," I don't know if you guys taking a cap when you're done pumping Tesla."
"423460","425840"," You should pump Amazon to all time highs."
"426280","427080"," Yeah, we can do that. "
"427180","428380"," We can talk about Amazon today."
"429520","433160"," We've been talking about Amazon for I believe three days."
"433860","438200"," And I think I've been talking about since last Friday and it was kind of a do or die situation"
"438200","438980"," for Amazon. "
"439600","441420"," We can look at the Amazon chart right now."
"442060","443360"," We've been talking about Amazon."
"444020","449180"," I think the question is you had accumulation and then a nice fat rip yesterday, right?"
"449720","451140"," See, we can get on the six month chart. "
"453740","455620"," You had this great accumulation down here."
"455920","461640"," The question was last week was, you know, does Amazon let the market go down and trade down or does"
"461640","464360"," it make its move up the same thing held for Tesla."
"464360","467240"," On Friday, it was kind of a do or die situation. "
"467440","469580"," You saw both of these stocks move higher today."
"469960","473480"," And someone wants to know if we're going to go up higher even higher today on Amazon."
"473980","474840"," I would assume so. "
"475240","476240"," This is some great accumulation."
"476600","477880"," Two million buys down below here."
"477960","480280"," I doubt that we're done at 34 15. "
"481120","483140"," We'll look to see where resistance is."
"483500","486080"," You know that your first resistance is at 34 40."
"486800","491020"," Your next resistance is probably at 35 11. "
"491420","492740"," So we'll look at that as the day opens."
"492740","499500"," It probably has a lot more room room to run than Tesla does in the day and a lot less"
"499500","500600"," volatility in its run."
"502260","506060"," About 477 calls after the belly yesterday, courtesy of how this plays that open. "
"506660","510960"," Yeah, you know, the yesterday we had that talk, right?"
"511159","517480"," And I said, you know, I was looking for to buy put spreads in the market and then I pulled"
"517480","520280"," back from that viewpoint because of the gap up overnight."
"520280","521400"," And that's what we did."
"521539","522299"," We've gapped up overnight. "
"523400","524500"," Someone's talking about NVIDIA."
"526520","528220"," So we didn't do that gap up overnight."
"528480","530400"," So then that changes your perspective, right?"
"530620","532760"," It is a bullish sign that are moving up. "
"532860","533720"," I like NVIDIA here."
"534000","536800"," We've got that content CEA conference or whatever."
"537560","539820"," The, you know, conference that starts tonight. "
"539820","546200"," That does bring usually a cell the news that those events, as it was called CS consumer"
"546200","548680"," electronics, something or other."
"550320","553380"," That is usually a solid news event, but this looks really bullish man."
"553760","554820"," NVIDIA looks great this morning. "
"556580","561020"," So I'm going to put book map up for you this morning at 9 30 and then I'm going to"
"561020","563400"," do some work on some charts."
"564140","569100"," And I'm going to trade today because I haven't traded I traded Friday and I took one trade"
"569100","573980"," yesterday morning and I need to put some trades on for myself today as well."
"574480","575560"," And it is Tuesday. "
"576140","578040"," Don't forget about to turn around Tuesday."
"578420","583340"," There's a famous fin Twitter out there that talks about how Tuesday is always look so bright and"
"583340","584140"," shiny for Monday."
"584140","590280"," And let's say if Monday was a down day Tuesday often is a green day. "
"590600","597140"," If two if Monday is a green day, oftentimes Tuesday looks very bullish and we turn around."
"597620","603420"," So I would say on the indexes, it wouldn't surprise me this morning on spy for us to trade up"
"603420","604060"," right off the bell."
"604060","614020"," And then to hit some resistance and start to how would you say it feel comfortable"
"614020","615080"," up here at these levels. "
"615760","621540"," Maybe maybe trading sideways for a little bit ups and downs and I don't think we trade down from"
"621540","622440"," here necessarily."
"624080","631280"," But I would I think that we're going to move higher off the bell at say 41 reversed and start"
"631280","632560"," to bounce around in here today."
"632920","633980"," I could be wrong on this. "
"635140","635860"," Today's kind of."
"636180","641540"," So being up here around 484 79 480 in this area."
"643500","647680"," We have we have some fear falling off the market as well this morning and yesterday. "
"647680","653460"," I know we've all been talking about that where this fear that the fed is probably not going to be"
"653460","658740"," tapering on the schedule that it's talking about or at least that's the image or that's the."
"659340","665140"," The trail that's out there in the news right now right that our economy could shut down at any"
"665140","665400"," moment."
"665400","671720"," So when you hear that, it makes you wonder if they're going to taper or increased rates and I'm not"
"671720","673400"," I don't think that they don't do that. "
"673400","677360"," I think though that the message right now is that the market is positive."
"677880","679760"," Let me know if you guys think that's true as well."
"680980","683120"," Yeah, I don't know when you should buy or shouldn't buy. "
"683800","684780"," How long do you hold?"
"684960","687340"," I don't know what you're holding for calls or puts."
"690300","695200"," And yeah, it's a it's reach your own with what your risk threshold is."
"695500","699340"," Do you sell half do you keep half do you make it the house money. "
"700460","705060"," You know my position on on I am very bullish on it right now."
"705680","707860"," I'm even more bullish on it than the spy."
"709440","715520"," It's making nice moves so you can see nice lower lows everywhere here here here and you can"
"715520","719500"," probably just track where the channel is and know where you can sell. "
"723850","728990"," You'll find a trend line on and that's not to say that this will be respected or anything but."
"730550","737140"," You know, it wouldn't be too surprising or too surprising to see."
"738200","740680"," I have been attacked to 27 but we'll look at book map. "
"740880","741420"," We've got a minute left."
"741500","743060"," I'm going to turn book map on right now."
"743400","744220"," I'm going to turn this off. "
"744820","746620"," I remember that 10 o'clock hour this morning."
"747540","748520"," The importance of it."
"749240","752720"," And I've got so much some work I have to do so I'm not I'll talk to you guys but"
"752720","754560"," I'm not going to talk as much as I do most mornings. "
"755280","757360"," I need to get ready to put some trades on."
"757360","761820"," And then when I make those trades, I'll let you know what they are."
"762100","766720"," And if you guys see anything, give me a shout in the chat and I'll try to change the book"
"766720","767320"," map for you. "
"769960","772820"," And to whatever you guys want to see, we're going to start with spy."
"773180","775740"," We'll check it on Amazon and Tesla."
"780180","785180"," Let's see a scope that 1540 sees yesterday open for 30 cents hoping to get a pop. "
"785180","785700"," Yep."
"786560","788480"," So now you're going to taper raise rates."
"788740","790460"," They have lots to lots of political pressure. "
"790840","794200"," Yeah, I don't think that they're going to stop the tapering either."
"795540","797600"," The previous open."
"799580","806840"," But I think that the I think that the message before was the fear associated with tapering and. "
"806840","810800"," And the rate increases, right."
"810960","813460"," And right now there, there's a message being put out there."
"814040","818600"," And the right now message is, you know, the fair in the economy. "
"819020","822820"," So that lends to fear coming off the market."
"822960","826700"," If you just check this morning, the fair ingredient decks, I haven't looked at, but I guarantee"
"826700","829460"," that we are not as fearful this morning as we were."
"832260","833320"," Last week, right. "
"833860","839080"," Everyone knew last week that we were going to sell off at 480 and we are not selling off right"
"839080","842240"," we haven't sold off yet or yesterday we didn't sell off at 480."
"843520","847880"," So that is the, and you've got calls coming right off the bell on the spy right now."
"850050","852010"," Let's take a quick look and just see. "
"856260","861860"," See where the real resistance levels are because we've got people claiming where they are, and I'm"
"861860","864220"," not quite sure that they are where people are saying."
"864660","873060"," You got some small resistance above here at 41 41 16."
"879840","881760"," This is the one from yesterday morning. "
"881760","886700"," You guys remember this one from yesterday was 46 or 486 91."
"887160","888220"," So make sure you mark that one."
"888340","890500"," You're going to write this one down as the call wall. "
"891140","893760"," This came out yesterday morning at like 9 30 this morning."
"893880","895580"," So this would be the call wall above here."
"895580","901760"," The expected range topping range is probably 484 36 right now. "
"905630","908170"," So you can put that into your onto your charts."
"908690","913670"," And you can see where the body dippers are down below here 476 64."
"914550","916350"," I'm going to put that on my charts as well. "
"923070","928270"," Yeah, but so I had it down at 476 34 476 64."
"929270","931150"," So just your charts for that today."
"931330","932410"," That's the by the dip area. "
"933010","934570"," You know where the by the dip is."
"934710","939690"," If you're not longing calls today, if you were too afraid to get into calls yesterday, you're by"
"939690","941190"," the dip is 476 66."
"942850","946610"," You can also see another one here at 478 39. "
"954270","956970"," So they've got two levels just off the bell, right?"
"957190","958530"," You already you've already got two levels."
"959390","963850"," Your next level is going to be right where we are battling right now."
"963850","969560"," Your next level is basically at 479 flat. "
"969560","970080"," Okay."
"981060","983860"," You've got a lot of sellers stepping in right now."
"984220","985440"," You guys can see that. "
"985940","988500"," There is some substantial selling coming at the moment."
"989400","992640"," This wave here came right in and it's starting to thicken up here."
"993340","995360"," It's a little bit of a blast of sellers right here. "
"996100","998560"," You see that the by the dippers are stepping up above here."
"999380","1003820"," I had a resistance level of 4185, but I'm not seeing that at all."
"1004400","1011880"," So I'm not seeing that 41 481 50 anywhere. "
"1020580","1022520"," And the hero indicator is turning negative."
"1022920","1024500"," We have more buyers than sellers."
"1025550","1032790"," We did have a wave of sellers moved down here right at 931. "
"1051310","1054850"," There's a lot of financial calls coming in."
"1054850","1085040"," I'm interested"
"1085040","1087160"," to see what XLF looks like off the bell."
"1092960","1097360"," That's why you got XLF right off the bell. "
"1097620","1099860"," Just green straight blue green bars up."
"1099860","1103540"," There's lots of calls coming in Bank of America on XLF."
"1111250","1120250"," Some spy puts SQQ calls, GM calls, but you've got JPM Bank of America XLF. "
"1120690","1125310"," There's a concentration of financial calls coming in right off the bell."
"1128880","1132500"," There's a lot of semiconductor calls coming in as well."
"1132660","1134100"," NVIDIA, IMTC. "
"1144220","1147040"," There's some puts going XLP."
"1147200","1148380"," Let's take a look at XLP."
"1166140","1167280"," That must have been the day before. "
"1169600","1171140"," Yeah, so the flow is very green this morning."
"1171300","1174700"," We've got a lot of calls on GM and Ford as well this morning."
"1175820","1177240"," So look at GM and Ford. "
"1181950","1183310"," GM's blasting off."
"1186280","1188580"," Ford is blasting off as well this morning."
"1191490","1193050"," Those are all-time highs, right?"
"1193410","1194530"," I think those are all-time highs. "
"1196880","1199080"," Both companies all-time highs this morning."
"1216160","1223340"," It looks like those sellers have come down on spy."
"1226240","1228600"," Like there's a bet against spy coming in. "
"1241620","1243080"," Let's look at Tesla real quick."
"1243760","1247940"," Any guys are looking for Tesla this morning to see if it's selling off at this point."
"1259580","1261880"," Looks like there's a bit by going on in Tesla. "
"1276460","1279120"," Let's see where the smart money is on Tesla this morning."
"1281440","1281980"," Okay."
"1284960","1294340"," 11.80. Yes, right where that touch was on Tesla buyers stepped right in. "
"1296640","1307270"," Right at 11.80. You've got some smart money down below at 11.50. So"
"1307270","1308650"," mark that on your chart as well."
"1320840","1330660"," So 11.80. 11.50. Price targets above include 12.10. 12.20. These are from basically"
"1330660","1331600"," the same as yesterday."
"1332180","1334280"," Just more selling coming in. "
"1335140","1344870"," Another new price target of 12.40. It's a nice dip buy in Tesla."
"1345770","1358960"," 11.80. The"
"1358960","1360780"," bears are really jumping in here on Tesla."
"1360780","1365940"," You have 365,000 sellers to 140,000 buyers. "
"1367140","1370240"," So just be cautious this morning entering into Tesla."
"1377230","1378930"," It's a little bit lower here."
"1401620","1408740"," So you have buyers that stepped in here 11.80. You've got more buyers below at 11.40. 11.51 "
"1408740","1413060",".51. You have more sellers hiding out above. "
"1414380","1425700"," 12.20. 12.08. Next"
"1425700","1443850"," round of sellers is at 12.40. Someone"
"1443850","1446310"," mentioned Airbnb this morning and Amazon."
"1446670","1450450"," We've got January 7th, 175 C's on Airbnb."
"1451730","1456050"," And January 7th, 3,500 calls on Amazon. "
"1458440","1463440"," We have a continued bid into energy this morning zone with January 21st."
"1463440","1465180"," XOM, I should say."
"1465980","1470140"," So you get XOM calls January 21st, 65 C."
"1471340","1474600"," There's a lot of timing that takes place in buying energy stocks. "
"1475400","1478860"," You kind of need to do it end of day usually and then hold them to the start of the"
"1478860","1479340"," next day."
"1482360","1484180"," Then you sell rinse and repeat, right?"
"1485100","1487540"," Buy the clothes, sell the open on on zone."
"1488900","1496870"," XOM tends to work out like that on the smaller. "
"1498850","1501570"," Spy indexes as well, the components of the spy."
"1510440","1513380"," Okay, so you guys have your levels on Amazon or on Tesla."
"1513480","1515240"," I'm going to move over to Amazon at this point. "
"1515840","1516700"," I'm going to do Airbnb."
"1539640","1542840"," I have to put on the futures feed on this computer next."
"1546440","1547420"," And we have it on the other. "
"1561130","1563550"," What do I mean by price target of 12.40?"
"1566480","1569840"," So what I'm giving you is your support."
"1569840","1575560"," The real reason what you're looking at are the those yellow and red lines that go across the"
"1575560","1575820"," screen."
"1576460","1578100"," I'll explain it to you better here. "
"1578120","1582840"," You can pause the video and go back if you watch and then refresh the page to join us."
"1583400","1591180"," But you'll see as I bring up tickers, you'll see red and yellow and blue lines below the current"
"1591180","1597260"," price of a ticker and red yellow and red lines above a ticker."
"1597260","1600780"," And that shows where support and resistance is. "
"1601300","1607840"," So if we make it to 12.40 today, I'll bring it back up and we will look at the"
"1607840","1610000"," next resistance levels above from there."
"1610400","1611340"," Support resistance."
"1612540","1613460"," So we will look at. "
"1616980","1618260"," I think tight here for just a minute."
"1623720","1625140"," OPEC meeting is coming up."
"1625600","1626840"," That's why Zova's pumping. "
"1628600","1631920"," Joe Harper's pumped on on IWM right now."
"1631920","1638560"," I know I know I can't believe I missed that."
"1639680","1641420"," Can't believe I missed my trade yesterday. "
"1641420","1642280"," I was too greedy."
"1642980","1644000"," I wanted it for cheaper."
"1646530","1649110"," And we tagged that IWM we tagged that right. "
"1649350","1649990"," We tagged that."
"1650570","1653190"," That upper resistance point right off the bell."
"1654610","1656270"," One that I charted out for you. "
"1656890","1658330"," Yeah, we did pretty much right."
"1659350","1660730"," Pretty much tagged it and bagged it."
"1674040","1675320"," Yeah, 70% is good. "
"1675420","1676400"," I'll take 70%."
"1677400","1679440"," Yeah, we'll look at IWM here in just a minute."
"1679520","1683400"," I'm going to bring up the I want to bring up Amazon for those that are trading Amazon. "
"1684000","1686880"," You know that you're by the depth level on Amazon is 3380."
"1687320","1688420"," You've got some support."
"1688640","1690640"," You also have support at 3400. "
"1691860","1696880"," Some pretty pretty decent resistance at 3430 and 3450."
"1698920","1701240"," You do have more buyers than sellers though."
"1701240","1703660"," You've got slightly negative hero indicator this morning. "
"1704600","1709600"," I would imagine a trade sideways for a little bit and then makes another move higher."
"1712880","1715540"," Then we're going to look at IWM next."
"1725860","1730360"," Remember when I talked to you about this morning that if you look if you sold your calls from"
"1730360","1733580"," yesterday and you're looking for a new by the dip level. "
"1734040","1738520"," We have some news coming out at 10 a.m. that might lend some volatility to the market."
"1738880","1741700"," You might get a better dip by in 15 minutes."
"1742300","1746740"," So just be conscious of that when you're going to re-enter your trades today. "
"1748240","1754900"," That's what I'm waiting for myself to take my next trade and in spy or IWM."
"1759320","1760760"," Let's give us a minute to load up."
"1761040","1762060"," Hope you're all doing well this morning. "
"1772730","1775530"," More buyers and sellers so far on IWM."
"1784630","1787610"," Your dip by an IWM today is 22503."
"1792470","1795150"," I like to call this during traffic right now and IWM. "
"1795150","1804670"," Your cashback close for yesterday at IWM is 22535."
"1805730","1810050"," And you can kind of see that right here right 23510 is the by the dip this morning."
"1810830","1811470"," And IWM. "
"1812390","1817590"," We know that once we get above this area here this 228 on IWM."
"1818310","1820450"," This is interesting to see as well here."
"1820990","1824710"," You can see that this band of sellers up here 230 have disappeared. "
"1824710","1832230"," So this is going to be an area of contention for IWM as it moves higher."
"1832530","1838110"," We know that there needs to be some short covering at some point at the ultimate target on IWM is"
"1838110","1838330"," 240."
"1839390","1840130"," And we did. "
"1840330","1841510"," It looks like the seller."
"1841750","1843310"," It looks like it's come down a little bit."
"1843810","1844530"," Oh no it hasn't. "
"1844730","1845930"," It's 24117."
"1846610","1852550"," And this morning on IWM you saw sellers come down."
"1853470","1855770"," So they're stepping in right now at this point. "
"1855950","1857530"," They are being overwhelmed by buyers."
"1857850","1859810"," They have a slightly negative heroin indicator."
"1860530","1861390"," I wouldn't put too much. "
"1862710","1865190"," I wouldn't put too much into this the moment."
"1866250","1871650"," What you're really looking for is for shorts to have to have to cover."
"1872510","1876470"," And if the shorts do cover we know that the overhead price targets 241. "
"1877650","1879350"," We know it's going to run at that point."
"1879350","1884010"," We know that this has been a battle since 213 and we're right there right now."
"1884170","1884310"," Okay. "
"1886170","1891370"," I would say that the news that could derail this would only be if the only news that could really"
"1891370","1895830"," derail this would be if we got some negative news from the Fed right."
"1896150","1897410"," We know that tapering is bad."
"1899110","1900830"," We've been told the tapering is bad. "
"1903900","1905380"," We've been told that rates are bad."
"1906340","1910100"," But recently of course we don't look like we're going to be doing that at all."
"1910100","1919920"," So 235, 225, 225.09 is your BTFD and your by the dip is right at 225.53. You don't"
"1919920","1921140"," have a lot of sellers above here. "
"1921240","1925100"," This is a very bullish context right now for IWM."
"1926260","1928300"," I'm going to be waiting for that news at 10 o'clock this morning."
"1928840","1930980"," Let's see what it brings up the manufacturing news. "
"1932920","1936020"," And remember I'm going to bring it up right now and see what it says."
"1975070","1975590"," Yeah."
"1975730","1976890"," S&P hits record high. "
"1977030","1978190"," The Dow hits a record high."
"1985690","1987570"," IWM is just cranking right now."
"1990560","1996940"," Well, four 79 98 on the spy. "
"1998680","2001500"," That's the that's the 480 pin that we were looking for."
"2016220","2020780"," So I guess the question to the bears is, do we sell off at this point?"
"2039100","2047199"," So a previous ISM manufacturing index numbers were 61.1. The forecast for today is at 60%."
"2047739","2052540"," So we're just waiting for that number to come out this morning to see how ugly it is. "
"2053679","2054920"," Where if it is even ugly?"
"2147870","2151670"," Looks like we've got some resistance forming up on the spy right here."
"2182540","2186600"," Be real careful here."
"2186660","2203860"," If you're out here on spy at this 480 for 78. "
"2225920","2226320"," Yeah."
"2226500","2227640"," Excellate XLF or nice."
"2231800","2234340"," And then revisit XLE and XLF at the end of the day again. "
"2241980","2242220"," Yeah."
"2242380","2245220"," I'll check in on Oracle for you."
"2272680","2272940"," Yeah. "
"2273100","2274100"," Ford is still cranking."
"2274600","2275760"," Still green barn it."
"2276760","2278600"," GM still green barring it. "
"2295270","2298190"," Still more Ford calls coming in the front door."
"2302520","2305160"," GM calls coming into about 950."
"2305800","2307060"," I haven't seen you since 950. "
"2307700","2309740"," There is some pressure on the queues."
"2310680","2317760"," Hood's got calls coming in January 7 18.5. Keep it on hood."
"2320140","2321380"," Robin Duhud. "
"2325110","2327370"," Apple has January 14th."
"2327510","2328470"," 800,000."
"2328630","2331310"," 800,000 bucks on January 14th. "
"2331670","2332650"," 175 C."
"2335610","2337570"," FCX January 21st."
"2338090","2338390"," 45 C."
"2338590","2339290"," I like FCX."
"2339450","2340610"," I like trading FCX. "
"2344590","2346450"," We have buyers overwhelming sellers."
"2346750","2349110"," You might get you might get a nice rip here on the spy."
"2350290","2351150"," The next few minutes. "
"2364000","2365180"," Make it a real nice rip."
"2366220","2369940"," You've got some sellers forming up at 41 29."
"2371940","2376760"," But see if you look anywhere else. "
"2379380","2380640"," Just general resistance."
"2382620","2384880"," 41 15 or so."
"2385980","2387280"," Excuse me scratch that. "
"2387380","2389740"," Did I say it's 48119."
"2391300","2392000"," 48119."
"2392700","2395180"," You have a lot of clear skies ahead though. "
"2396180","2398500"," Now it's 48 7011."
"2402780","2407420"," Almost looks like spies trying to form a support area here."
"2407720","2409460"," Which is to be anticipated, right?"
"2410060","2411500"," You start to form a base at 480. "
"2412060","2414360"," And you start to think about much higher."
"2417180","2419100"," It's 49 on the table would be the question."
"2423480","2424500"," What do I have here?"
"2429900","2430340"," 4869. "
"2430880","2432240"," I think it was 4669."
"2432840","2433520"," This is the question."
"2434540","2435800"," Do we trade that much higher?"
"2439210","2440570"," And just keep your eye on this down below. "
"2440810","2442670"," You've got 656,000 buyers."
"2443850","2444730"," 523 sellers."
"2445310","2447410"," Hero indicators off the charts for spy right now. "
"2448030","2449750"," We could rip much much higher this morning."
"2450670","2455910"," We've got three minutes until the manufacturing numbers come out."
"2463440","2465680"," We'll check out in VDA because it's cranking. "
"2465940","2466420"," Here's Oracle."
"2470900","2473200"," Nice support in Oracle at 8850."
"2477240","2480340"," And countering some sellers above here at 8903. "
"2481440","2482400"," And 89118."
"2484060","2486300"," You have more buyers than sellers on Oracle."
"2486920","2488300"," If you can break through this resistance. "
"2489400","2490680"," You do have clear skies above."
"2501610","2502950"," I would assume to 100."
"2503750","2507910"," It looks like your by the dip is 8510 on Oracle. "
"2508490","2509750"," Maybe take profit here."
"2510390","2512890"," Wait to break above 8933."
"2513710","2515450"," And then the sky is the limit. "
"2516030","2516890"," You take it to 100."
"2517390","2522030"," If you don't break through this resistance here in Oracle, you're going to look to rebuy the dip at"
"2522030","2531750"," 85.05. Look at"
"2531750","2532510"," NVIDIA next."
"2537580","2540480"," It's got a lot of call flow coming through on it this morning. "
"2540480","2542300"," As a matter of fact, let's do it up."
"2542440","2542920"," Let's check."
"2543360","2547460"," We're at an 88% bullish posture in the market right now. "
"2548740","2549700"," I'll scratch that."
"2549820","2550240"," We've gone down."
"2550360","2551640"," We're not 82%. "
"2553980","2556980"," You've got the number one call flow is in GM."
"2558680","2562000"," It's focused around January 7th."
"2563360","2566280"," January 21st and March 18th. "
"2566580","2570560"," March 18th or we've also got some February 18th in here."
"2570560","2573880"," I'll post the GM flow on Twitter right now for you."
"2574900","2576580"," You can see what this flow is. "
"2578240","2579440"," But find out."
"2579780","2582900"," The oldest flow came in from 933 to 953."
"2584720","2587020"," So you might be waiting for a dip to enter. "
"2605570","2606050"," BAC."
"2607990","2609990"," I didn't even look at BAC this morning."
"2612400","2614800"," I'm assuming that that green body right up the open as well. "
"2635680","2636780"," That's the second here guys."
"2636780","2643740"," Let's see."
"2645580","2646300"," Yeah. "
"2646440","2649100"," Ford's got 2023 orders on Ford."
"2649640","2653380"," If there was one that I'm looking at to keep going up, it's possibly Ford."
"2658440","2661160"," Jim's calls slightly trailed off. "
"2661940","2665900"," Whereas GM, excuse me, GM's slightly trailed off."
"2666700","2668660"," Ford's calls kept coming in."
"2669240","2670280"," They didn't stop. "
"2682250","2683750"," How's Rivian doing this morning?"
"2684570","2686610"," I posted a picture of Rivian yesterday."
"2686610","2690890"," I was unsure on the look of the Tesla Cybertruck."
"2691890","2693210"," I had mixed feelings on it. "
"2693310","2695290"," It wasn't really negative nor positive."
"2702760","2704540"," I'll show some other calls for you here."
"2721020","2728220"," But when I saw that Rivian truck or that sport utility, you know, it's like you want like a mix"
"2728220","2728680"," of both. "
"2729080","2731500"," Both kind of looks futuristic."
"2732660","2736900"," The Rivian sport utility looked like an old PT wagon."
"2738120","2744640"," You know, someone mentioned yesterday the kids would like it and the like the look of it, which. "
"2746120","2748580"," Yeah, my kids would like a PT wagon too."
"2748840","2752800"," But I wouldn't be caught dead driving and nor would you have in the early 2000s."
"2753460","2755040"," I think it was dodged that made that car. "
"2756780","2758880"," But I wouldn't be caught dead driving that."
"2759160","2761320"," So how do you get the mix between both of them?"
"2761580","2763080"," It actually looks more like."
"2764560","2765640"," What I would expect. "
"2766740","2768600"," An apple car to look like, right?"
"2768760","2770560"," Or when people are snidely remarking about."
"2771500","2772940"," What the apple car looks like."
"2773280","2775280"," And I'm not I'm not anti Rivian either. "
"2775280","2777680"," I have some friends that work for Rivian Lucid."
"2778660","2781840"," And also for Tesla family."
"2782600","2783940"," That work for these companies. "
"2784540","2785660"," So family and friends."
"2785900","2789880"," So it's not as though I'm anti these companies in any way, but I'm not going to say that."
"2789880","2789920"," I don't know. "
"2789940","2792340"," I just the design choices for me are."
"2794600","2797300"," I don't know."
"2797480","2800220"," On one side, I can't stand the Ford interior. "
"2800880","2805040"," I feel like they just took an F one 50 and said to throw a laptop in it, right?"
"2805340","2807540"," So that the interior of the Ford F one 50."
"2808180","2808620"," I didn't like."
"2809180","2810800"," I didn't like the exterior. "
"2811420","2815560"," I want the exterior to be slightly more modern than it is right now."
"2815980","2818820"," I like the old old school for it in exteriors."
"2818820","2824060"," I got throwback retro is kind of cool on a Ford truck, but on. "
"2824620","2828920"," If it was a new for electric field, I want to know that I want it to be tough."
"2829200","2829880"," Still tough looking."
"2830860","2831960"," Spies coming down. "
"2832540","2833880"," These numbers come out."

"2899670","2900530"," I mean, that's the thing is. "
"2901470","2909190"," If the someone's implying that with a manufacturing numbers being bad that will get more stimulus"
"2909190","2913650"," or more stimulus, you can say, or more more money flow."
"2920210","2923770"," And looks like Lisa Sue is talking right now."
"2924330","2924970"," About AMD. "
"2925350","2926410"," So we'll bring up the MD chart."
"2950610","2951030"," Yeah."
"2951750","2952510"," Didn't we talk?"
"2952650","2953670"," Didn't I talk to you guys?"
"2954810","2958210"," Somewhere about weakness, the sell the news on these events. "
"2965060","2968960"," I've been a fan of four trucks and six liter in the six four El Fiasco's I'll stick to random"

"2980840","2982720"," I don't know how much I can say on."
"2984180","2985040"," Turn this off."
"2985040","2989920"," I don't know how much I can say on. "
"2994030","2995190"," My issue with a lot."
"2995330","2996050"," What can I say?"
"2996650","2997730"," I don't know what I can and can't say."
"2999970","3001410"," I'm going to get in trouble for saying. "
"3003290","3005090"," You know, a lot of these companies are."
"3006610","3008630"," There's a guy out there's a face of the company."
"3008750","3010530"," A woman man doesn't matter is a face of the company. "
"3011410","3014430"," And then there might be a hundred engineers."
"3015490","3021370"," This is the model that was created by Ford and GM and Chevy and Dodge and all these companies."
"3021790","3025830"," What happened was Ford started to. "
"3028820","3032720"," So you're by the dip this morning on Nvidia is to 80."
"3034320","3037580"," You have way more sellers than buyers right now on Nvidia."
"3040600","3043560"," And you've got a pretty big ceiling above from 310 to 330. "
"3047130","3049650"," So these are typically sell the news events."
"3049650","3052250"," And it looks like that's what we'll do at AMD next."
"3053830","3055910"," So what happens what happened was this. "
"3056270","3058190"," Let's say we'll use Ford as an example."
"3059690","3061470"," Ford used to do everything in house right."
"3062150","3063850"," And then they switch to this model where. "
"3064470","3068470"," They have some manufacturing but a lot of their manufacturing is not in the States anymore."
"3068650","3074050"," Some of some of the assemblies in the US manufacturing but not as much as you think."
"3074750","3076070"," And a lot of their parts. "
"3076070","3081730"," They're designed like a lot of the design of these vehicles a lot of the parts for these vehicles"
"3081730","3084790"," where the dies are made everything is made overseas."
"3085730","3086310"," And so."
"3088050","3094350"," The thought process is can we the thought process from a lot of these guys is well we'll do the"
"3094350","3100870"," Ford model right we'll just hire a hundred engineers will design a concept for a vehicle. "
"3102350","3107590"," We'll have a face to the company and then we'll just source it all out to smaller companies."
"3107990","3109630"," And they're these companies ring Detroit."
"3110510","3116370"," You see all these manufacturers are small dime manufacturers you'll see a component into the"
"3116370","3116970"," interior exterior. "
"3118770","3122530"," Component finishers and manufacturers but you see a lot of them overseas."
"3123010","3123330"," And so."
"3123330","3126950"," I like that there are all these companies are becoming companies. "
"3128210","3132410"," But when you know you got we make fun of nickel or you got to make fun of nickel right."
"3133030","3135810"," But a lot of these companies aren't too far off from a nickel."
"3136010","3137110"," A lot of these companies. "
"3138070","3141530"," They and that's the difference with Tesla is they're producing cars."
"3142170","3147450"," It's a critical thing to understand that when when Tesla's actually producing something."
"3148090","3154970"," When you see Tesla manufacturing in house when they're even even when they have to substitute"
"3154970","3155670"," parts. "
"3156450","3163110"," The more that Tesla is working with the design in house manufacturing in house."
"3164330","3171030"," It's it's that old school Ford model and how to design and develop and manufacture electric"
"3171030","3171630"," vehicles."
"3171630","3176890"," And there really isn't too many companies doing that including Ford. "
"3177550","3182370"," When they these these are these these same these small companies that are that are trying to break"
"3182370","3182970"," into this game."
"3183370","3185870"," Ford basically does the same thing these small companies are doing."
"3186350","3188650"," Most of these companies are not doing this in house. "
"3189270","3191210"," That includes Ford Chevy all of them."
"3191470","3193730"," And I look like I like I have a Cadillac."
"3194210","3199890"," I've got two Teslas the one Cadillac that I have I like they're going all electric vehicles right"
"3199890","3201610"," now. "
"3201610","3204910"," You've got support down below one forty four ninety five."
"3205370","3207530"," You've got further support at one forty oh six."
"3208030","3212270"," You've got some resistance above it one fifty three eighty seven one fifty four seventy. "
"3212850","3214730"," Then a big wall above it one fifty nine fifty."
"3215630","3217330"," I'd be looking to buy a dip possibly."
"3217790","3219750"," There's more sellers than buyers on AMD. "
"3220490","3224810"," Just like we were just like we saw on Nvidia a few minutes ago."
"3224810","3228710"," But you're by the dip is up at one forty four ninety four right now."
"3229070","3232210"," And then I would have a tight stop and try to reenter again at one forty. "
"3235730","3239930"," The but the thing that you're looking at is that most of these companies are not manufacturing in"
"3239930","3240150"," house."
"3240830","3243490"," For all the shit that you can give to Elon Musk."
"3244970","3247970"," For free because it's got some bad stuff that you can't deny right. "
"3248610","3250430"," There's bad stuff that you can't deny about Elon."
"3250430","3253910"," But for all the bad the the good."
"3254590","3258690"," That Elon Musk does in terms of his manufacturing the research. "
"3258850","3260870"," The development the in house engineers."
"3261930","3262830"," The parts."
"3271590","3274510"," Just so you can see down here by the dip four seventy eight. "
"3275010","3277910"," Or seventy fifty one and then you've got sellers above."
"3278510","3281170"," Still have slightly more buyers and sellers on the spot."
"3282070","3285650"," But what he's trying to do and you know the fact that he's trying to make cars that. "
"3285650","3289110"," That you can buy for thirty grand or twenty five grand or whatever whatever."
"3289770","3291390"," Inflation is at this year but."
"3293070","3297070"," Making the car for the every man at the sexiest vehicle out there even though some of you think it"
"3297070","3299150"," is the sexiest it makes the sexiest cars. "
"3299870","3302930"," But what he's trying to do with vehicles is a lot different."
"3303610","3308210"," And most car companies today most not all but most the vast majority of them."
"3309010","3312970"," So everything is sourced out today speak to any engineer that works for a car company they'll tell"
"3312970","3314150"," you half of them doing it. "
"3314410","3316170"," This guy will say I'm an engineer for Ford."
"3316650","3318970"," And you find out that they're not actually an engineer for Ford."
"3319070","3322750"," They're an engineer for some other company that's doing the interior trams or they're doing. "
"3323170","3325150"," You know the pain to doing this or they're doing that."
"3325550","3328790"," But they're not directly contracted to another company with a firm."
"3329190","3331810"," Whereas Tesla has a lot of it how stuff going on. "
"3332790","3336330"," Okay so eleven seventy eleven fifty on Tesla."
"3336890","3338670"," You got a wall building at twelve ten."
"3341200","3342900"," I'll bring this out for you guys a little bit more. "
"3345750","3350230"," And so that's that's where I put my faith into well that's why I'm putting my faith into Tesla"
"3350230","3350790"," right now."
"3351250","3356610"," I want to see a company be able to have a manufacturing process from start to finish."
"3357310","3358070"," Just like Ford did. "
"3358790","3362170"," And you know you hear the banter between Ford and Tesla."
"3362170","3365190"," But in reality if you know what you need to do."
"3365610","3369810"," Which helped me to come to understand with Tesla. "
"3370790","3372770"," Was I went down the Ford rabbit hole."
"3373310","3374630"," Instead of the Tesla rabbit hole."
"3374690","3377710"," I went down what Ford did to create that company. "
"3378550","3381530"," How they're manufacturing process and the research process."
"3382390","3383650"," And how they developed over the years."
"3384870","3388730"," And it's shocking how close they match what Tesla's doing. "
"3390150","3393610"," Get a nice bump bounce here eleven seventy on Tesla."
"3395130","3397090"," We talked about eleven fifty down below here."
"3398710","3402190"," And we know that we've got some resistance above now farming at twelve ten. "
"3407550","3410250"," Spies curling over right now like it wants to sell off."
"3415440","3416680"," Got those weak numbers."
"3416880","3419620"," They're going to they want Jay pot to come out and save more money. "
"3420380","3420800"," Probably."
"3430760","3431100"," Yeah."
"3431700","3432200"," Yeah that's true. "
"3432200","3435220"," The tool and I companies are closing it are closing down right now too."
"3435460","3437500"," Even those are kind of going the way at the wayside."
"3438640","3440800"," We've got Kosh Kari speaking an hour. "
"3440900","3442320"," The Fed Jima glue made dump us."
"3442760","3443880"," That's Matt Kova saying that."
"3444140","3445120"," I agree with that Matt. "
"3445260","3446420"," It looks it's looking like it."
"3447440","3448900"," Steve what where it's yeah."
"3449300","3450780"," All these companies are going the wayside. "
"3451100","3451700"," It's funny."
"3451820","3452060"," My butt."
"3452200","3452700"," What are my buddies. "
"3453000","3455620"," Or an engineer for Ford."
"3456560","3458980"," And they they have to send."
"3458980","3462240"," They did do the designs here in the US now right. "
"3462740","3464580"," And now they're setting the designs to China."
"3465240","3467160"," For the tool dies to be made."
"3467620","3470660"," And if the tool dies aren't but that whole process now goes to China. "
"3470980","3472300"," Then if the tool dies aren't right."
"3472940","3475820"," They have to reconfigure or fly over to China."
"3476440","3478980"," And it's still it's not being done the US like it once was. "
"3481100","3482540"," I can do QQ for you."
"3487000","3489040"," Palaceford coming in mid-January with wall release."

"3556680","3557860"," All kinds of nonsense."
"3559620","3560360"," Blowing money. "
"3566850","3568330"," Blowing money on camera gear."

"3659510","3660330"," I haven't done this yet."
"3660550","3661310"," I'm going to do that this morning. "
"3672160","3673100"," So we'll see how this rolls."
"3700590","3702670"," Golden sacks is cranking right now."
"3705080","3707380"," I made a little joke about golden sacks this morning. "
"3713940","3714980"," And someone wanted."
"3717000","3725840"," One of the cues up was a retest one of the cues up."
"3725840","3735590"," So we have some cue, cue, cue puts"
"3735590","3736110"," coming in. "
"3737090","3739650"," I will put the post those."
"3740190","3743390"," I've got AMD puts coming in some spy puts coming in."
"3743870","3744830"," Skills puts. "
"3745530","3748170"," I'm going to post these on Twitter right now for you."
"3749870","3751310"," Se like trade messy."
"3752530","3754090"," I don't need more of what I used to. "
"3758270","3759630"," It looks like semis."
"3759850","3761210"," You guys should check out."
"3761450","3762250"," If you guys are going to short. "
"3763830","3764430"," Semis."
"3764810","3768490"," Look at going after S O X X after socks."
"3816660","3817560"," Let's take a look here. "
"3823700","3828380"," What are we looking for for support and resistance on the cues."
"3835280","3836160"," Pull that out."
"3836440","3840740"," Pull that out. "
"3851670","3853550"," You've got some support down below at 390."
"3858800","3862980"," You've got some buyers swooping up from down below at 394."
"3862980","3868520"," Now up at 396.54. And they're also at 398. "
"3869760","3871400"," So those would be your supports."
"3872440","3875960"," The price target on the cues is 40302."
"3878520","3879160"," 40284. "
"3882180","3882820"," 40481."
"3887620","3889760"," You do have some negative flow coming in this morning."
"3891380","3895000"," Although you do have equal buyers and sellers. "
"3895500","3900280"," Your ultimate price target on the cues is 40974."
"3901140","3905720"," This looks like more like basing than it does selling off right now to me."
"3905820","3907700"," The market doesn't look like it's selling off. "
"3908220","3909660"," This just looks like basing."
"3914780","3916280"," Do you guys think differently than that?"
"3916480","3918060"," Do you guys think we're selling off right now?"
"3918540","3919040"," This is the question."
"3924480","3927780"," What I'm going to do here in a moment is I'm going to. "
"3928780","3931880"," Leave you guys with book map open."
"3932880","3934840"," On the spy feed, I believe."
"3936460","3938240"," Yeah, this doesn't look like it's selling off. "
"3938420","3940620"," You guys don't understand that the."
"3941460","3942420"," That the."
"3943240","3946660"," You guys didn't understand that the spy is connected to the cues. "
"3947620","3951960"," And IWM small caps is somewhat connected to spy in the cues."
"3952540","3956160"," If you start to see a spy failing, you should be also seeing."
"3956980","3959160"," The cues fail right now is that somewhat fail. "
"3960440","3961000"," And."
"3962180","3966160"," Anyone that thinks that we're selling at this point."
"3968720","3973240"," So if you think that the market is selling off right now, this is what I wanted to talk to"
"3973240","3973940"," you guys about yesterday. "
"3974420","3976300"," We were right what we did talk about yesterday."
"3976860","3979700"," We were talking about heading into the clothes yesterday."
"3981340","3984740"," The important thing to watch for yesterday was. "
"3985480","3986800"," As we're heading into the clothes."
"3987640","3992680"," You start to want to get bearish right let's get bearish let's sell Tesla let's sell spy."
"3993420","3996160"," Let's sell whatever, but then on the but on the flip side. "
"3997960","4003900"," We talked about if we gapped up into this morning and we gapped up into this morning."
"4004480","4007240"," We were placed above that for 480 mark."
"4007620","4009900"," It's now becoming support at this point. "
"4009900","4014660"," You're not going to see the cues fall if we're creating support on the spy."
"4015220","4019900"," You might see sideways action on the cues, but you're not if you see the cues start to drop 5"
"4019900","4020400"," 10 points."
"4020480","4021900"," It's going to impact the spy. "
"4023300","4028220"," And we wanted to wait this morning to even even Tesla opened this morning."
"4028540","4034360"," I think at 12 17 right so a lot of people wanted to take that short yesterday at 1200 or"
"4034360","4035040"," see at 1200."
"4036340","4040820"," So this this doesn't look like the market is pulling back right now. "
"4040860","4047320"," If anything, it looks like we are going to try to form some support here and look to higher"
"4047320","4047660"," numbers."
"4047900","4052240"," Look to 486 489 somewhere in there."
"4052680","4055180"," Do I think that that's a lot of money on the upside?"
"4055260","4060120"," Probably not, but as for right now, it's not looking like we're selling down. "
"4060120","4064480"," So I'm going to leave the you have your your support."
"4064620","4066100"," So you've got your support at 490."
"4066440","4068660"," You've got support at 3907. "
"4069720","4078000"," You've got targets of 40293 40482 and ultimately 409 on the cues."
"4078500","4080720"," So we're going to leave the spy up for right now."
"4080860","4087120"," And you can use this generally speaking for the market health, right?"
"4087120","4091760"," You can use the spy as almost a cure all for the entire market. "
"4097060","4116460"," And if see if"
"4116460","4151520"," you can see anything above that by"
"4151520","4154819"," the dip for 7849 47802."
"4155840","4157319"," More buyers down below."
"4158760","4162020"," We do have more positive hero indicator. "
"4162859","4166000"," And it looks like we have slightly more sellers than buyers."
"4175310","4177470"," I'm going to take a break here for just a minute."
"4177590","4178529"," I'll come right back to you. "
"6139360","6140680"," I have input capture."
"6141560","6142820"," Let's see if you guys can hear me."
"6147200","6148880"," Let's see if you can hear me. "
"6155200","6156080"," All right."
"6157420","6161020"," I like that potentially."
"6176580","6179320"," All right, let's see if you guys can hear me. "
"6184830","6185970"," You guys can hear me now."
"6190120","6191200"," Sounds like you can hear me now."
"6193060","6193640"," All right. "
"6210480","6213340"," You got Amazon falling to will bring up will bring up Amazon next."
"6219470","6224370"," So you have some pretty firm support here in Tesla, which is at 1150."
"6224370","6225930"," We talked about the open this morning. "
"6225930","6232270"," And we said amount of resistance was 1070 by the jet was 1150."
"6238440","6244120"," So I guess the big question would be if you're a Tesla bull, there's this break right here, which"
"6244120","6245180"," is really what we want to know."
"6248950","6251010"," And so that's what we're going to be looking for here. "
"6251850","6255610"," You do have more sellers than buyers right now on Tesla."
"6256230","6259570"," You are looking for a break here at 1150."
"6263920","6266500"," If this support holds, you should be fine. "
"6268540","6271200"," The smart money looks like it's on 1150."
"6271400","6272400"," That's where it was this morning."
"6276240","6280940"," Smart money was at 1150 this morning, but it looks like this support is breaking. "
"6281560","6285500"," If it does break, let's see where the next level of bank money is at."
"6287840","6289300"," It's down at 1100."
"6289800","6292260"," So you're in a pretty major support right now in Tesla. "
"6292820","6293900"," Are you guys going to hear me?"
"6293900","6297420"," Is it way too loud in my too loud?"
"6297420","6298180"," Should I turn it down?"
"6299340","6300280"," I'll turn it down."
"6300740","6301840"," I'll give you my bedroom voice."
"6302560","6309520"," So we are beginning to break through the 1150, which is a pretty significant support for Tesla"
"6309520","6310360"," 1150. "
"6311720","6316660"," Now we want to see more sellers than buyers, which we do see."
"6316660","6322140"," We've seen minus 10 minus 10,000 on the hero indicator."
"6323060","6324660"," Well, it really hasn't broken yet. "
"6325200","6326680"," You really need to see it."
"6327040","6327600"," It's breaking."
"6328100","6328740"," I'll give you that. "
"6328860","6329160"," It is breaking."
"6329640","6332120"," You have some minor support here at 1140."
"6333100","6336420"," What's called the smart money, someone else just mentioned smart money. "
"6337440","6340260"," So the smart money is usually the bank money."
"6340600","6342400"," You want to know where they're laying in wait."
"6342400","6346800"," So they were waiting to buy the dip here at 1150 this morning. "
"6347300","6350780"," And your next support on Tesla is at 1100."
"6351540","6354840"," You would want to see this support down here, swoop up."
"6355080","6360080"," If it does not swoop up, you will see Tesla trade down to the 1100 mark. "
"6362950","6363390"," It broke."
"6368780","6369900"," No sound is perfect."
"6372020","6372780"," Too funny. "
"6373440","6373680"," Okay."
"6373920","6374640"," So here's your deal."
"6374640","6378580"," You are breaking through support on Tesla right now at 1150. "
"6379080","6380900"," Your next support below is 1100."
"6387990","6389770"," Spy is breaking through right now."
"6389770","6402740"," Earlier on another stream, I showed you that the support for spy is 474.19. I"
"6402740","6406420"," think it's 474.16. Maybe one too. "
"6410080","6411880"," So we'll bring up the spy feed real quick."
"6412060","6414960"," Do you guys want to stay on the Tesla feed or do you guys want to show you where the"
"6414960","6418960"," spy support is at 47412?"
"6429100","6429820"," That's hot."
"6432300","6434160"," He has as funny as I'll help. "
"6438670","6441070"," Please check SPX on support."
"6441670","6441830"," Okay."
"6442010","6445150"," So Tesla, you haven't really broken support yet. "
"6445610","6447110"," You've broken underneath support."
"6447290","6449830"," This will become a resistance at some point."
"6449970","6452670"," I want you to point that out to Tesla bulls out there. "
"6452970","6455370"," You do have more sellers than buyers on Tesla."
"6455370","6462530"," But winds up happening in these situations is if Tesla cannot reclaim 1150 at this point, this will"
"6462530","6467210"," grow into resistance and you'll be looking to buy the dip no less than 1100."
"6468230","6474470"," Now, I do want to point out that I'm not looking at a candlestick chart now. "
"6474950","6476250"," Let me take a quick peek on Tesla."
"6481280","6484970"," There is a form of a do or die on Tesla at 1120."
"6486060","6486520"," Let's take a look. "
"6489440","6490860"," It's actually slightly lower."
"6490860","6491400"," Yeah."
"6491600","6493040"," So 1100 is firm support. "
"6493500","6495840"," I wouldn't be too concerned if we bounced off 1100."
"6496420","6500500"," I'd be looking to be a buyer on Tesla once again and 1100 myself."
"6502380","6504660"," Now, if it does reclaim 1150, you can watch. "
"6504860","6507760"," I'll put the stream back up for our here for you in just a moment."
"6508240","6509460"," We are touching."
"6510040","6510960"," What's the two are?"
"6511800","6512920"," It's not the one day. "
"6519520","6522600"," And it does look like on the 50."
"6522600","6527480"," The 50 day is coming up on Tesla right now."
"6528480","6532580"," Like January 6th or 7th. "
"6533160","6537700"," We would, we would, we would slide down the, the bearish."
"6538200","6540600"," Excuse me, the bullish channel."
"6541580","6547080"," We're now over and then spring back up on, let's say the 7th of January. "
"6548940","6551680"," But we're still in a bullish context overall on Tesla."
"6552640","6553960"," It's just a matter of when you're buying."
"6556710","6558770"," So firm sport 1100 on Tesla. "
"6559430","6563390"," You are seeing a bounce right now on Tesla at 1150."
"6563790","6567450"," So I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be saying we're breaking through just yet."
"6568150","6570450"," You want to see if there's some rejection here. "
"6570810","6573110"," If you see some rejection here at 1150."
"6574690","6578270"," Sometimes you'll see the bounce right breakthrough come back up."
"6578270","6582310"," If we're not able to reclaim this though, the price target would become 1100. "
"6583490","6583930"," 1100."
"6585690","6587850"," So you're looking for a reaction right now 1100."
"6588270","6589310"," And then we'll go to the SPX. "
"6599770","6604510"," Dude, I got to switch over to the, so I have a, I have the DX feed on this computer."
"6605450","6609830"," On my other computer, I have the futures license."
"6610150","6611430"," I have to like download it. "
"6611930","6614410"," I'm going to do some work to get it over on this laptop."
"6614410","6618670"," So we will just look at the spy again real quick."
"6622420","6623840"," Some of you like the sexy voice. "
"6624640","6627560"," Some of you prefer me not to talk, if they talk in the sexy voice."
"6629120","6630480"," It's not really a sexy voice."
"6631520","6631840"," Okay. "
"6632180","6633320"," What, what are we doing here?"
"6633720","6634400"," I don't want SPX."
"6636180","6637180"," I want a spy."
"6638200","6638980"," That's close enough. "
"6653770","6656570"," I kind of like that dip by an 11 on 1134 on the spy."
"6657430","6659490"," The problem with Tesla right now is."
"6660850","6666550"," We usually trade down for two, three days and then make our next push. "
"6671540","6676640"," I'd really like to buy a Tesla at 1100, to be honest."
"6677940","6694220"," I'd like to trade that 1100 mark and"
"6694220","6696900"," see that the buyers stepped up from that 474."
"6697400","6699280"," So there were buyers here at 474. "
"6699600","6702300"," We should have stayed on the spy and they came right back up."
"6703400","6706220"," And met the spy right at 476."
"6710120","6712080"," We have a nice bounce on 476. "
"6713980","6714580"," 477."
"6716840","6722690"," 476.50. It might take a long here."
"6735800","6737080"," Let's take a little look here. "
"6746680","6746980"," Why?"
"6747540","6760050"," This is 476.90,"
"6760210","6767340"," 476.60. I still think we're going down."
"6767340","6772020"," I still think we're going to, where did I have it at?"
"6775780","6785410"," I like 474.19. But the 474 buyers aren't there anymore."
"6787930","6789730"," I'm not sure if they came above. "
"6792770","6794590"," To buy the dip at 477."
"6796070","6797730"," I think we've got a lot more sellers here."
"6798530","6799670"," I might take a short right here then. "
"6801930","6805770"," We've got 837 and 680 on the."
"6808350","6811330"," It's a nice target down below there for 62."
"6814970","6816510"," There's that 474. "
"6817170","6819330"," So this was much stronger down here earlier."
"6819570","6828150"," It's 474.18. 474.16. I didn't have spy on the sea if the buyers had swooped up at 4711."
"6836420","6839340"," There are some XLP puts. "
"6840820","6846460"," Light put buying on Apple misfit and SFT AMD still."
"6846940","6848620"," Some Apple puts are coming in right now."
"6848960","6851300"," Some Tesla calls are coming in right now. "
"6851900","6855680"," And there is some dark pool buying on the spy right now currently as well."
"6857180","6861010"," I really like this 474."
"6865040","6867940"," It looks like our looks like our sellers came in. "
"6868260","6869800"," We are below the VWAP as well."
"6872080","6873080"," Kind of like it here."
"6882100","6884300"," We got more GME or GM. "
"6886260","6887860"," Neil Palantier puts planter."
"6891280","6894300"," And we've got some QQQ puts coming in as well."
"6895120","6896300"," Yeah, see this right here?"
"6897060","6899260"," This support is growing weaker at 474. "
"6899620","6900220"," That's some concern."
"6900220","6907820"," I can't tell right now if they're moving up to meet at the 476.90. I would think that we're"
"6907820","6908760"," going to get out of 474."
"6930590","6933970"," So let's take a look at the options chain. "
"6937910","6940350"," 474s for Wednesday is 69 cents."
"6943090","6944130"," 67 cents."
"6945330","6948540"," And my advice on these. "
"6951840","6954480"," 65 cents and get them a little bit cheaper."
"6974880","6978000"," Looks like that 474 is firming up a little bit more too."
"6981900","6985440"," It was going away and now it's getting a little bit stronger than it was back here. "
"6986340","6987820"," Maybe we'll have a nice little sell down."
"6990120","6992660"," We are below VWAP set 478."
"6995040","7006770"," There are"
"7006770","7008550"," dip buyers stepping in on the spy right now. "
"7008570","7009070"," I'm still waiting."
"7021580","7029060"," And Tesla is coming up looking for, you might find a rejection here at Tesla looking for rejection"
"7029060","7030200"," at 1148."
"7031560","7037480"," 75 and your next rejection point would be 1163ish. "
"7038600","7039340"," 760ish."
"7042840","7045280"," You'll know if Tesla trades down right here."
"7048020","7049780"," And if they do reject right here. "
"7050140","7058780"," This would be a rejection of the one minute daily chart on the 21 day moving average."
"7079180","7083040"," So you're seeing this these buyers step in down here."
"7083140","7085020"," So this is what someone mentioned it on the stream. "
"7085200","7086140"," They know what they're talking about."
"7086360","7089340"," So that's what's called the smart buyers smart money with banks are."
"7090320","7096540"," Looks like there's dip buyers forming up once again down here at this 47 for 74 mark. "
"7097500","7101620"," We want to keep an eye on this and see if they swoop above."
"7101840","7105480"," If they don't super above, you'll sometimes get the money."
"7105660","7109620"," It'll come to this money right eventually we'll get to 474. "
"7110580","7114740"," It's like a mosquito to a bug zapper."
"7115440","7118240"," So I'm going to be looking for 474 in the spy right now."
"7119360","7124700"," And we still have more sellers than buyers, although people are buying the dip and the hero"
"7124700","7126520"," indicators going green again. "
"7128120","7133400"," I'll leave this up here for a moment and we'll check the Tesla feed real quick."
"7146720","7148620"," Get a wave of sellers coming in on Tesla."
"7149800","7154040"," It looks to me like the ultimate target on Tesla would be 1100. "
"7154440","7155760"," It's firm support for Tesla."
"7156840","7158980"," Although we are below below V1."
"7159460","7162620"," We do have some negative flow coming in on Tesla right now as well. "
"7164320","7170440"," And legitimately if Tesla was to retest 1100 and bounce off, it's very, very bullish for Tesla."
"7174360","7179140"," And your next point of rejection for Tesla, you're going to be looking for rejection somewhere."
"7181540","7182140"," 1158. "
"7182920","7183760"," See this right here."
"7184780","7186000"," This 1156 maybe."
"7186000","7193020"," Yeah, I see clear skies above to 1190. "
"7194280","7195280"," Mark that off."
"7198260","7200160"," Clear skies above to 1190."
"7200680","7201620"," If you can break through. "
"7202480","7204380"," If you can break through 115582."
"7206020","7209760"," You should have one more rip higher before coming lower."
"7212040","7217020"," But you can see where the smart money is right smart money is down here 1100 and then the sell"
"7217020","7218880"," the rip is above 1189. "
"7221430","7222290"," Maybe slightly lower."
"7223590","7224470"," 1188 17."
"7226250","7229670"," It's kind of like a no man's land area for spot floor in Tesla right now. "
"7236520","7238620"," And the spy looks like it wants to trade down to."
"7241460","7244400"," 474 check back and see if this is coming up and it is."
"7245160","7269360"," This is where the smart money is down below 474 currently if"
"7269360","7271720"," you bring up your charts for I and TC. "
"7272740","7276480"," There was a bottom that was just touched on I and TC."
"7277120","7279320"," They had a sell off this morning."
"7280040","7282100"," They bounced off 5264. "
"7283420","7285960"," And some call flow a golden ticket."
"7286460","7288920"," I don't know if everybody here knows what golden ticket is."
"7290380","7293120"," But a golden ticket and some follow up flow. "
"7293980","7297540"," There's a lot of dark pool buyers stepping in on spy right now just adds up."
"7298180","7301360"," Now on IMTC some golden ticket came in at."
"7302220","7303800"," For July 15. "
"7305460","7306840"," For 50 C."
"7307540","7308360"," 5 0 C."
"7310480","7312600"," For 1.1 million dollars."
"7313420","7316920"," When I answer golden tickets I tend to turn them into spreads."
"7318000","7323200"," I make them stated slightly farther out than whatever the date is. "
"7323200","7329620"," So it's July 16th or 15th and they can have rather end of July or August."
"7332060","7334400"," And then slightly more than the money like a 45 or something."
"7334620","7340940"," You can do the 50s they probably won't hit though until after that expiration in July 15th. "
"7341060","7344140"," I'll post those on Twitter right now for you."
"7344560","7346860"," There are some more put flow coming in."
"7347220","7354180"," The other thing to remember on the other thing to remember on golden tickets is. "
"7354720","7355640"," Timing is critical."
"7356480","7362160"," So if you're in an up direction or an up channel, an upward channel."
"7362720","7365100"," You want to wait until you hit a bottom of an upward channel. "
"7365500","7369320"," If you're in a downward channel and you see golden me post golden tickets."
"7369920","7372840"," You want to wait for the turn before placing those bets."
"7374100","7377500"," Or I should say you probably shouldn't ever place those bets. "
"7381290","7383130"," Don't ever follow me not financial advice."
"7385930","7392150"," But these INTC calls for July, July 15th, 50s see I'm going to post them right now."
"7398590","7402410"," And what I'll do is INTC is making a turn right now. "
"7403010","7410760"," So I'll post where I will try to enter this trade as well as the golden tickets."
"7413980","7415000"," I'll put both up."
"7419380","7420600"," We're trying to buy these. "
"7422660","7432520"," Look at a nice little nice little bottoming pattern"
"7432520","7433520"," night INTC."
"7437810","7439890"," So I'm going to look to enter INTC."
"7440130","7447510"," I'm going to set alert for for 51.73 and take on those 50 C calls for July. "
"7462330","7464670"," And if we get close to down there at some point this week."
"7464830","7467590"," I'll have the alert go off and then I'll follow that trade."
"7469030","7472330"," Some times I miss these golden tickets. "
"7472330","7476810"," But usually when these big plays are made on a ticker."
"7477150","7481650"," There is some more downward movement and then you'll see us take off again."
"7483430","7486030"," So send alert 51.72 or so. "
"7486250","7487090"," You could go a little bit higher."
"7487830","7491630"," I might make it a little bit higher like 52 dollars."
"7493370","7495330"," I can grab it at 52 even. "
"7497440","7498380"," I'll take that trade."
"7531200","7532800"," Yeah, I'm excited down here."
"7532820","7534660"," It can signify a couple things. "
"7534860","7537060"," You've got more sellers than buyers on spy right now."
"7538900","7541980"," You can signal that buyers have stepped up to that 476."
"7543080","7544980"," And then we can look below 47. "
"7545260","7547960"," You guys can see it's pretty strong right here, right?"
"7548240","7549100"," 474 19."
"7549980","7551820"," It's actually picked up a little bit."
"7552680","7554200"," This is where the smart money is. "
"7555100","7557600"," If we can get down to 474, I'll take some calls."
"7557600","7560440"," It's really what I'm looking for."
"7560560","7563120"," If I can get 474, I'll pick up some calls here. "
"7568700","7569920"," I don't know if I called that."
"7570200","7571860"," Right now nothing looks bearish about it."
"7571980","7572240"," Yes. "
"7574180","7575200"," Yeah, it does need to clear."
"7575320","7576420"," Well, it needs to clear about 480."
"7577780","7578900"," It needs to stay above 480. "
"7579940","7584520"," For us to stay bullish or we can trade down slightly down as we trade sideways."
"7585620","7591060"," We really want to see support being built here at 480 or up here at 480."
"7591480","7594500"," And right now you've got lots of sellers who are saying, hell no, we're not doing that. "
"7595000","7595780"," And I don't blame them."
"7596180","7598960"," I don't blame sellers entering the market right now."
"7603340","7604960"," Can't decide to go to sell here in Oracle. "
"7606660","7608220"," So you guys got your numbers on Tesla."
"7608840","7610820"," You guys know what to look for in Tesla, right?"
"7610940","7612240"," We're coming down in Tesla right now."
"7612680","7614400"," Look for a reaction at 1100. "
"7614860","7616620"," We'll check back on Tesla at 1100."
"7636010","7636410"," Subscribe."
"7645400","7646520"," For you a coffee. "
"7650480","7652680"," I woke up this morning at 1.30 in the morning."
"7652680","7654200"," Normally I wake up at 3.30 in the morning."
"7656060","7660040"," We'll go to not 1.30 this morning and then went down the Joe Donut rabbit hole. "
"7660980","7662780"," Well, I went on the lens."
"7663360","7668080"," When it looked at lenses yesterday and then this morning I went down the lens rabbit hole and the"
"7668080","7668980"," camera rabbit hole."
"7669500","7674520"," From 1.30 until 8 a.m. It took me six hours on rides. "
"7674740","7676060"," That's six, seven hours or something."
"7677020","7678680"," Just reading and watching."
"7679500","7685940"," I haven't used manual camera since maybe high school. "
"7686920","7693350"," I had to guess slow this down a little bit."
"7699010","7700510"," We are down below VWAP."
"7703600","7706140"," I'm not getting over the bearish right now. "
"7706380","7710160"," Even 474 is not bearish on spy."
"7713060","7714560"," I guess that can be for some people."
"7715420","7719200"," You'll be really nice if we tagged like 470 or 465. "
"7720680","7721860"," I doubt we get there."
"7722380","7737670"," Maybe if any"
"7737670","7741230"," of you guys that are listening right now or watching this feed right now."
"7741770","7744330"," If you're you like a test chicken. "
"7744650","7746470"," I know exactly when to buy dips around here."
"7746590","7750070"," We have the buying part of the day probably not."
"7753480","7759520"," If you find yourself fearful of buying dips or selling rips or when you should enter an exit"
"7759520","7759880"," trades. "
"7762080","7764100"," You should just open it like open up a."
"7766720","7768140"," I think there's one account."
"7768580","7772880"," I think you can do paper trading there or find a brokerage that does paper trading."
"7774860","7777340"," You can just follow along when you're supposed to be buying and selling. "
"7780900","7781820"," Just paper trading."
"7786060","7787560"," We talked about Oracle this morning."
"7787980","7792200"," We talked about there being a ceiling here at 89.90. 91. "
"7792400","7794500"," We talked about whether by the Dippers were $85."
"7795200","7797180"," I think do you have any low jump?"
"7797380","7798460"," Dippers are lower than that?"
"7804540","7806240"," No, you'd rather dip as 80 bucks."
"7815450","7817070"," You've got about equal sellers and buyers. "
"7817770","7819030"," But this is where the real money is."
"7819270","7822890"," When I talk to you guys about where the real money is or where the smart money is."
"7823470","7825710"," You don't have to focus on just one ticker. "
"7825890","7828310"," You go out there and you find a basket right."
"7828610","7829770"," 10, 12, 15 stocks."
"7830450","7835350"," Whatever the flow is coming in on that day and take a look and you say, hey, look, I'm going"
"7835350","7838650"," to set a mark on my chart with an alert. "
"7839250","7839890"," 85 bucks."
"7840870","7846450"," If it comes down here and you buy that dip and ride it up, if the dip doesn't come to"
"7846450","7851130"," you in this stock, you move on to a different stock and find something else with a dip buying"
"7851130","7851450"," opportunity."
"7851770","7858210"," You do like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 of those and you can find where you'll know that"
"7858210","7859490"," one will come through that you can buy. "
"7860290","7863150"," The prime example of that is Tesla right now."
"7863430","7865650"," I don't know where Tesla's at, I have to click over here."
"7867870","7869650"," But Tesla right now is a prime example. "
"7870830","7875550"," If you're a bull right out there, here's the bulless in this broadcast right now."
"7876550","7878630"," You are looking for a bounce off 1100."
"7879250","7880890"," That is the bounce to buy. "
"7881530","7884790"," So if we can get down to 1100 today, I will buy that bounce."
"7886450","7890910"," Does that make sense?"
"7890910","7892890"," When Tesla's at 12, 20, should I buy here?"
"7893610","7898690"," Always look for the opportunities to buy dips and to not be fearful down those dips."
"7899090","7900870"," Same goes from Oracle, just set yourself an alert. "
"7901750","7904690"," 85 bucks sell for profit and then re-enter."
"7904910","7910650"," If you're upside down on a trade like this, always trying to like, you should never be holding this"
"7910650","7910850"," anyways."
"7911090","7914670"," You should be holding 85 to where his distance is. "
"7915350","7920890"," Let the banks do the work for you and then retake that trade above, right?"
"7920890","7924510"," You're trading 90.62. So you're not trading this area here."
"7924830","7926310"," You're trading this area here."
"7926850","7930250"," You're trading this area here and you're trading this area here. "
"7930450","7933810"," And if you're a bear, you'd be trading this area here down, right?"
"7934450","7936530"," And you'd be trading this area going down as well."
"7940460","7945520"," So you've got some touchy feeling going on the 21 moving average, 21 day, moving average."
"7948540","7950340"," You know, 1123. "
"7950640","7953120"," And you could still see some consolidation down at 1100."
"7953120","7957360"," It could slide slightly down for a few days on Tesla."
"7957920","7963360"," So I'd be looking for a touch on 1100 and I'd be looking for maybe a couple days, two, three"
"7963360","7968700"," days of slightly downward on top of that bullish channel, right?"
"7968940","7971040"," That you saw that bull flag that was that was on Tesla. "
"7971600","7972820"," And then I ripped much, much higher."
"7976800","7980640"," And actually a bounce off 1100 to 1190 gives you 80 points."
"7981100","7982600"," It's a pretty good day for Tesla. "
"7984970","7985970"," Sometimes you'll miss them."
"7985970","7991870"," Sometimes it'll come right back at 1123, like the buyers will step up on a ticker from that 1100"
"7991870","7995930"," support because green kicks in for bulls."
"8006300","8008440"," So a buyer of the spy down here at 474. "
"8009260","8024670"," If we can get down here today, we'll look up Tesla, we'll"
"8024670","8025810"," let that load up here for a minute."
"8038470","8045270"," If some of you guys, if you don't trade Tesla a lot, it's usually, you'll see 80 to 90 point"
"8045270","8052070"," runs, 100, then you'll see sometimes like 90 to 130, 140 point runs over a few days, three, four"
"8052070","8052250"," days."
"8053050","8057770"," Then you'll see three or four or five days of downward movement, especially for moving up, right?"
"8058690","8059830"," You want to catch that move. "
"8061330","8062550"," You want to catch each move."
"8062710","8066070"," You had a move here on the 21st of December."
"8066650","8067510"," We traded that, right?"
"8067830","8069050"," You guys remember we traded this move. "
"8071340","8072020"," It ended on the 27th."
"8072820","8076860"," We had one, two, three, four, five days of consolidation."
"8078920","8085140"," We just had a nice sexy move above that took two days, three days if you counted the extra 20"
"8085140","8086220"," points at 1220. "
"8087700","8094900"," It says we peaked out here at 1211, but I remember it being this morning at like 1217."
"8096880","8100400"," It's claiming here in cash market that the top this morning was 1211."
"8101080","8105480"," I saw I saw 1217 this morning in pre-market. "
"8111020","8115900"," If you can get down and catch this bounce off this bull flag, it's not uncommon."
"8117120","8120040"," We'll look at some of those bounces."
"8120040","8129520"," It's way too because 1100 is sounds right. "
"8129740","8131000"," 1100 sounds about right."
"8137890","8140370"," I'm going to be looking to enter Tesla at 1100 if I can."
"8140850","8145330"," I do want to think about, you know, does it bounce off 1100 and then trade down for three to"
"8145330","8147070"," five more days and then make another run?"
"8150140","8151120"," What's going on here?"
"8158570","8164650"," I saw buyers stepping in down here in Tesla at 1124, 1120. "
"8165070","8166170"," That's only 10 points away."
"8171500","8172520"," Buyers stepping in."
"8177660","8179280"," So I'm going to set an alert at 1100. "
"8183650","8187830"," And you guys remember too, I missed the IWM call yesterday because I was too cheap."
"8188210","8189110"," I'm a very cheap trader."
"8191170","8193049"," I'm looking for backscades. "
"8193870","8222250"," Some of you guys want to take on more risk that I understand that getting some"
"8222250","8228020"," light bogging down and then plug my camera here."
"8282850","8286530"," And you got buyers stepping in on spy and the option side of things."
"8287110","8292750"," They're buying the four A C's on January 7 for a dollar zero eight. "
"8293170","8300549"," And they're also doubling down on the January 5th 480 C for 48 cents."
"8302150","8307090"," There's a hundred thousand contracts that were taken out on that 480 C."
"8316959","8322040"," We do have some interest as well on the 465 P."
"8322900","8327120"," On spy was a 36 cents."
"8328500","8337000"," There's 10,000 contracts out there for 36 cents for January 10th. "
"8344230","8348250"," January 12th is interest on 476 P and puts."
"8357940","8366639"," So January 12th interest is on 476 puts January 10th."
"8367760","8372520"," Is on 465 puts. "
"8377719","8383440"," And then we've got calls concentration on January 7 for 80 C."
"8389030","8391450"," And on the January 5th 480 C."
"8402710","8404370"," See if I can move this back."
"8412560","8413840"," It's going out here."
"8414560","8425260"," Yeah, you've"
"8425260","8427420"," got some resistance above here at 1145. "
"8428480","8432800"," 1150 you have some resistance on the spy or on Tesla that's moving down."
"8436360","8441240"," So 1150 is now becoming resistance on the spy and see that bounce above here."
"8441860","8446120"," Talked about if you can't break through the 1150 and reclaim this as support. "
"8446900","8450820"," You got buyers stepping in now also at 1125, 1119."
"8451820","8454540"," But again, your major buyers are 1100 on Tesla."
"8455560","8458200"," And that's where I'm going to set my alert right now. "
"8458620","8460980"," This is the buy 11, 1101."
"8471120","8473320"," I'm sure you guys all know how this goes, right?"
"8481910","8485210"," And if you are still bullish on Tesla, you think this is just intraday weakness."
"8486750","8489350"," Then you are looking for a break above 1150. "
"8489510","8494330"," 1150 is a key, a key number right now for Tesla on the intraday."
"8495630","8497850"," To break above this number."
"8498790","8500450"," And reclaim this support. "
"8500910","8507490"," If you remember yesterday, today, 1150, well, 1170 was some light support."
"8507890","8510110"," We had pretty decent support at 1150."
"8510610","8512770"," And we know we had major support at 1100. "
"8513310","8516270"," But this area right here of contention is 1150."
"8516790","8518730"," You really need to break above it."
"8518870","8521330"," You need to be that be accepted as new support. "
"8523250","8530090"," If this doesn't hold as new support on Tesla at 1150, then what you'll find out is that we will"
"8530090","8533930"," slowly trade down until we get to what's called the real money."
"8534270","8535190"," This is where the banks are."
"8535630","8536210"," They will wait. "
"8536430","8542550"," They will lie here and wait until we trade down to 1100 so they get the position that they want."
"8548140","8550860"," Sometimes this takes three days, five days."
"8551760","8553540"," We'll end up trading down below here. "
"8553900","8555300"," We'll buy it and we'll run it back up again."
"8557600","8564700"," So if you're ultra bullish, wait for a break above 1155.99 and then you can pick it up and"
"8564700","8565780"," run it up to 1190."
"8567600","8570020"," It's a danger zone right now for bulls. "
"8571800","8573580"," This is a rejection area."
"8573700","8574920"," It's turning into a resistance."
"8574920","8579120"," And what you really want to do is see a support grow here. "
"8579460","8582000"," You can get a support to grow here at 1150."
"8582640","8585900"," It'll then turn into a bullish context for Tesla once again."
"8594660","8596200"," Let's see if we can get some IDM. "
"8596480","8598700"," So we got item calls are back to six cents."
"8599540","8600580"," I'm going to be down to buy those."
"8606010","8606630"," Oh, yeah. "
"8607090","8608550"," In fact, I'm going to enter some right now."
"8608830","8616290"," Thank you for the heads up on the IWM calls."
"8616290","8626030"," You do have some buyers"
"8626030","8630330"," stepping in and call options on Tesla, by the way, and spy and Ford. "
"8631070","8631910"," I NTC."
"8634750","8636690"," Has some more call flow coming in on it."
"8643020","8644440"," Yeah, did you guys alert me?"
"8644600","8646640"," We when we tagged down here at 2337. "
"8647400","8649240"," What about the show at the bottom down there."
"8649240","8651100"," All right."
"8651360","8651840"," All right. "
"8651980","8652840"," You have always need a lot."
"8652980","8653840"," What was the paying attention?"
"8654000","8654260"," I don't know."
"8655300","8658520"," We'll be here trying to deal with some with some new tech. "
"8660520","8662540"," Again, another bounce off to 23, please."
"8670510","8672270"," One more bounce off to 23."
"8673070","8674130"," Thanks for the heads up on that. "
"8674250","8674410"," I don't know."
"8674630","8677110"," I don't know what about those exact calls again."
"8678350","8679370"," I have to look at the chain. "
"8694900","8695900"," Thanks for the heads up."
"8701700","8702900"," January 5th."
"8702900","8706750"," I don't like those. "
"8711260","8716640"," Now they're looking now people are looking at the January 7th calls for 230."
"8717420","8719880"," I wonder if we hit it on the 10th."
"8722720","8723900"," This is kind of interesting. "
"8725740","8727160"," Hold on here."
"8740200","8741400"," January 10th."
"8753760","8754360"," It's interesting. "
"8754800","8762520"," There's a lot of interest on calls in the 10th and 12th, but not on the spy on the 10th"
"8762520","8763200"," and 12th."
"8766720","8772400"," And there's some puts out there for the or 220 on the 14th on IWM."
"8798490","8800750"," I wish I grabbed those calls down below there. "
"8807400","8808440"," That was a nice price."
"8828550","8832930"," You know, there is something it was talking to someone was talking to Joe yesterday about IWM."
"8836490","8837450"," And that. "
"8840450","8843090"," Yeah, I'm always making fun of Elliott waivers."
"8844930","8846970"," And it's not that I don't believe in Elliott wave."
"8849010","8850790"," I do believe in Elliott wave. "
"8851350","8853510"," I just don't think that it's accurate enough to predict."
"8855470","8858270"," But for general moves, it's not so bad."
"8859330","8862330"," And I wondered if IWM has had its last correction. "
"8863230","8865510"," It doesn't look like its correction is complete."
"8866810","8869630"," And I talked about there possibly being some weakness."
"8870830","8874410"," Into February and March that we might see one more drop in IWM. "
"8890820","8892960"," You can see that last target, like 208."
"8894620","8897040"," Like you get everybody on board on IWM."
"8898220","8901080"," And then you create you complete. "
"8906330","8910390"," A corrective move going down to 208 into February and March."
"8918990","8923030"," There's such a huge dip that was bought back on December 17."
"8923870","8925670"," And people loaded up the boat. "
"8943200","8955000"," Do you"
"8955000","8957680"," guys think that IWM is coming down from here over the next."
"8958540","8961000"," Into February, March, at least one more time."
"8985820","8988440"," So it's good to see Tesla breaking above 1150. "
"8989480","8992600"," You want this acceptance here of 1150."
"8994620","8997160"," You want this to see this acceptance."
"9000470","9004930"," And you are going to see bull step in at this point and running gun for 1150. "
"9005790","9007150"," They can hold this 1150."
"9031600","9033420"," And trade this up to 1190."
"9037990","9048960"," 1188.67. It"
"9048960","9054000"," has broken through and over the 20 and 50 on the daily SMA on the one minute chart. "
"9078890","9080910"," The spies broken above as well."
"9081830","9090770"," And missed my spy dip by damn it."
"9091070","9099130"," I wanted that 474 so bad. "
"9099510","9099770"," So greedy."
"9108110","9110770"," One, two and three rocket ship."
"9119120","9126080"," That bounce on IWM is in that channel was almost to the pin on that channel on IWM. "
"9126080","9133880"," All right, I'm going to get back to what I was doing and I'll check back in with you guys"
"9133880","9134200"," later."
"9134780","9136740"," Is there a specific ticker that you want me to leave up?"
"9147360","9148280"," Nothing's random here."
"9153990","9154870"," Yeah, let's. "
"9155630","9158890"," Even though I suggested that buyers were 474, it's hilarious."
"9181160","9183700"," You got to love the people that lose money all day long."
"9196390","9199770"," Yeah, so we looked at, we looked at Oracle and. "
"9201750","9204390"," Yeah, we looked at Oracle's really is only."
"9206430","9210930"," Oracle is, you know, the thing about Oracle is it doesn't trade like."
"9216460","9217540"," It doesn't move. "
"9218640","9219540"," I've tried trade."
"9219740","9222820"," You got, you really, if you're going to buy anything on Oracle, you buy like a three month alcohol"
"9222820","9225280"," and you just forget about it for two months."
"9226120","9226780"," Or a month. "
"9227680","9228860"," And check back on it."
"9232180","9234260"," I've traded Oracle multiple times."
"9235080","9235940"," It's like trading Walmart. "
"9236300","9237900"," It's like asking me to put Clorox up."
"9238280","9238740"," No offense."
"9238980","9239380"," I like Oracle. "
"9240060","9241080"," It just never moves."
"9241520","9246200"," Really, if anything, you just buy like year out leaps on Oracle and hope that they get a new CEO."
"9248560","9249360"," I shouldn't say that. "
"9249940","9250740"," I like Oracle."
"9251080","9251940"," It's just that they don't."
"9252040","9252740"," It doesn't move. "
"9253240","9254680"," It's not traded by day traders."
"9255060","9256560"," It's traded by banks only."
"9259660","9262120"," I've, I've fallen into the Oracle trap too before. "
"9266370","9267890"," So let's be clear out there."
"9268050","9268190"," Okay."
"9268330","9272410"," I want to be very clear to you traders out there, especially traders that are new traders. "
"9273090","9273590"," Okay."
"9275490","9277130"," I mean, very clear to you."
"9279420","9282960"," Your real money on the spy is at 474. "
"9283760","9285360"," You can say whatever you want."
"9285640","9288060"," You can, you can tell me anything that you want."
"9288940","9290860"," But that's where the real money is on spy. "
"9291460","9291800"," Okay."
"9291800","9300660"," And if you want to win more trades than lose more trades, even if it doesn't come to you."
"9300900","9305680"," I want you guys to understand that you're going to miss trades because the money comes up higher. "
"9306260","9308620"," Let's say it comes up to 476 or 477."
"9309700","9315640"," You still want to, you want to take more often than not."
"9316020","9320180"," You'll move up with the early money and grant it and it still comes back. "
"9321380","9323560"," It still comes back to."
"9325640","9327140"," To where the real money is."
"9327500","9335420"," So if you are looking at 10, 15, 20 tickers, one of those will come to you to buy. "
"9336520","9340300"," Well, you guys all out there that are chasing money, like I'm telling you, like."
"9341140","9342820"," That just eats your account."
"9343500","9346400"," I'm kind of chase money up chase tickers. "
"9347000","9353460"," I have, I've switched to letting, letting the ticker come to me to where I, what, what I want to"
"9353460","9354020"," pay for it."
"9354600","9358100"," And it's not just me, these, these are what banks are willing to pay for it as well."
"9359780","9367260"," So regardless of where the spy is right now, you can see that the dip buys down here at 4716. "
"9368080","9371560"," Now, that doesn't mean that dip buyers aren't here on the spy right now."
"9371560","9377900"," But it does mean that for me, when I'm buying, I'm looking for, for a certain tags."
"9383370","9384150"," Anything but Tesla. "
"9384410","9384810"," Yeah, we're on spy."
"9390740","9392040"," I'm looking to buy 474."
"9394020","9395760"," So you guys have to buy wherever you want to buy. "
"9396200","9413420"," That's where I'm looking to buy 47413."
"9419530","9420430"," Yeah, you're going to check it."
"9420530","9421430"," I'll check AMC for you. "
"9422990","9424570"," Yeah, you got to have patience out there."
"9424670","9426890"," Like you guys, you're not going to win every trade."
"9427270","9428830"," Well, you already know you're not going to win every trade, right?"
"9429270","9431170"," So if you know, you're not going to win every trade. "
"9432190","9434750"," And why are you chasing trades like that?"
"9435530","9437870"," Chasing trades and not winning every trade equals."
"9438230","9440010"," I lost seven trades and only one three."
"9442050","9445490"," You want to put as many of the odds in your favor as you possibly can. "
"9447210","9448690"," Before you go all in, right?"
"9448930","9450130"," Before you take on risk."
"9460280","9461840"," Your wife's boyfriend knows this."
"9462040","9464620"," We traded the spy all the way up a week ago or two. "
"9465220","9467100"," And it was worth taking that risk on."
"9467100","9470220"," And we made a lot of money on that run up."
"9470600","9474960"," So don't want to lose all that money on a few points on spy. "
"9475340","9475920"," Probably not."
"9477580","9480380"," Yeah, it looks like AMC is on us on a nice support here."
"9488510","9490310"," Let's see what you guys got for AMC out there. "
"9492010","9494450"," We got zero minus 20."
"9495290","9496830"," There's some buyers at negative 20."
"9497770","9499130"," There's some buyers at 10 bucks. "
"9502280","9502660"," It's terrible."
"9504000","9505280"," I like this trade at 25."
"9506900","9508760"," It'd be nice on this trade right here in AMC. "
"9509740","9515260"," We're being in the money call doing in the money call to 28 bucks."
"9516580","9518180"," I know it's not Las Vegas."
"9519840","9523620"," Big money style, but I bet a real, a real nice buy down here. "
"9524380","9526640"," You've got some light support down below it 20 bucks."
"9527920","9528980"," But you look like you're at support."
"9529400","9531600"," This is a nice, this is a nice place to buy and see. "
"9532460","9533520"," Look at that in my chart."
"9540290","9540490"," AMC."
"9544400","9545820"," Yeah, 24 80 is a great buy. "
"9551550","9552890"," You know, I will say to you."
"9554110","9556330"," I like that by 20."
"9557030","9559750"," I like to buy 20 bucks to be honest. "
"9562870","9565870"," And it still looks like it's in a corrective phase itself, right?"
"9566150","9567550"," From the 47 dollar mark."
"9568230","9570990"," It doesn't look like it's done correcting here."
"9576640","9577200"," Let's look lower. "
"9577360","9578760"," Let's look lower on AMC real quick."
"9579940","9580740"," I know the hedge funds."
"9581160","9587300"," I sit inside of these rooms where all these hedge, hedge fund boys. "
"9588660","9593120"," Say they can't wait for AMC to be two bucks or three bucks or some, I guess."
"9593860","9596040"," The owner of AMC owns them and like two or three bucks."
"9596520","9597640"," He loans them out. "
"9603570","9605330"," But 25 bucks is a good, good area."
"9606470","9609670"," You still have some buyers down below at 19 or 2011."
"9610690","9614030"," But even here, we just didn't end the money call for three months out. "
"9614430","9616650"," You know, at some point it's going to just hammer again."
"9616950","9618330"," You know, at some point you're going to win."
"9622520","9623780"," The resistance is at 27 90. "
"9629730","9631090"," Sometimes I miss these trades."
"9631770","9633170"," I don't know how I miss these trades."
"9633730","9635290"," Like I would have totally bought that bottom. "
"9635630","9636970"," I like the hood bottom too."
"9637510","9638910"," But I was too greedy on hood."
"9639990","9642310"," I wanted hood at like 15 bucks or something. "
"9643250","9647230"," I still think I might get what I'm looking for in February and March."
"9647650","9650250"," I think we're going to have some downtime coming up."
"9651070","9652170"," We're going to have a down moment. "
"9652710","9657770"," I looked, I did a back test on the market going back to 2007, 2008."
"9659850","9665010"," And when I back tested the market for where we were at the end of the year this year, we"
"9665010","9668610"," should have at least one down moment this spring."
"9670230","9671370"," Spide like 450. "
"9672110","9676690"," It's pretty much guaranteed, not guaranteed, but it's like an 85% chance that happening."
"9683140","9683180"," Yeah."
"9683460","9684460"," See, this is where I'm at. "
"9684760","9685220"," Let me show you."
"9685300","9686940"," I was talking to somebody about this the other day."
"9688180","9690080"," See down here at this 15 right here. "
"9690600","9694160"," If I can get, if I can catch hood at 15 bucks, I'll be happy."
"9694420","9696600"," This right here is where I'm a buyer."
"9697840","9702840"," And I don't care if I have to wait to get it at 15 for the next three months, but"
"9702840","9703440"," that's my plan. "
"9703640","9704660"," Buy this at 15 bucks."
"9705340","9706520"," Now, can we go up from here?"
"9707680","9709240"," Surely we can, right?"
"9709880","9711380"," You have double the sellers right now and hood."
"9712380","9713420"," Do I think we can go down here though?"
"9713680","9713740"," Yeah. "
"9714120","9716680"," So this is on my, my buy list at 15 bucks."
"9724020","9725120"," No matter what anybody says."
"9726440","9728180"," And I don't pay attention to too much news. "
"9728920","9730060"," You guys see news there."
"9730240","9733660"," You guys, I mean, I do trade the news, but I don't trade it like you guys trade the news."
"9736880","9738860"," I look to see if we're on support. "
"9739260","9742520"," If the news is good and if we're at resistance, right?"
"9743380","9744920"," Is it used for sell the news?"
"9745440","9747080"," You guys always, you guys always hear people out there."
"9747260","9749860"," They're always talking about, oh, with sell the news."
"9752430","9756170"," And I'm like, well, we were at resistance, major resistance. "
"9759030","9761870"," But I am looking for news to come out around supports and resistances."
"9767670","9769070"," Sometimes they're blatant about it."
"9769230","9773010"," Sometimes, you know, they'll get put negative news out, but sometimes they don't have negative"
"9773010","9773250"," news. "
"9773470","9777730"," So they'll just use the negative, the positive news as a sell the news type of event."
"9778530","9780870"," See if the buyers have stepped up yet on the spy."
"9785440","9786300"," It's like they're still there. "
"9788100","9789560"," These buyers right here."
"9790440","9791540"," What is going on with it?"
"9792600","9795520"," I might have to reset this and reboot the entire thing."
"9796580","9799960"," Because I'm saving previous, previous workspaces here. "
"9800520","9806080"," And it's just, it's, it's, it's probably using 10 eight or 10 gigs right now in my GPU."
"9808660","9810820"," Probably should have reset it on Friday of last week."
"9818800","9820180"," And saving all the historical data. "
"9830060","9833140"," Yeah, there's good defending right now on spy or on Tesla."
"9834220","9836580"," Problem with Tesla though is if it doesn't establish."
"9837520","9840340"," Problem with Tesla is it has, it has to create. "
"9840940","9846900"," So you really want acceptance of 1150 as support on Tesla."
"9847920","9851560"," I don't like that the banks are down at 1100 on Tesla right now."
"9851860","9852560"," What's going on here?"
"9856200","9858320"," I don't like that the banks are down at 1100. "
"9859060","9860940"," We've seen this time and time and again with Tesla."
"9861180","9864740"," You guys know, you know, you'll see a support out at 1150."
"9864920","9869220"," Then you'll see the, you'll see three, four, five days of sideways down movement. "
"9870060","9871020"," And then we make that river move."
"9887860","9889940"," See if we can get this on this chart looking good."
"9905810","9908630"," It does look like some of the buyers are disappearing here. "
"9910310","9912430"," Looks like they've moved up from this 474."
"9912850","9914530"," Now they're just attacking up above."
"9923030","9923950"," Bulls are defending. "
"9928200","9930260"," Let's see if I get my 474 now."
"9930800","9932280"," Bulls are definitely stepping up right here."
"9932760","9936420"," I want you to pay attention to also to where we are on spy. "
"9936980","9939420"," You saw that one dip this morning on spy, right?"
"9939420","9940600"," It was at 1105."
"9941300","9943100"," Another dip at 1127."
"9944540","9950160"," And what looks like a real dip, but no, it's looking like a false dip at 1142. "
"9951120","9953120"," And right now we're 1203, right?"
"9953700","9957740"," And you had somewhat of a failure on the 7MA and the SMA on spy."
"9958260","9960600"," It was rejected on the daily SMA."
"9961220","9962620"," You bring up a daily SMA, right?"
"9963380","9967040"," On the simple moving average on the, what is that?"
"9967740","9972800"," On the daily 100 SMA on the spy, right?"
"9973300","9978660"," One minute candle on the spy with a 100 SMA we rejected. "
"9981340","9982520"," You don't want to see that."
"9986470","9991630"," And we are seeing some support disappear on the spy down at 474."
"9992190","9993210"," There's a little bit, but you see this?"
"9993850","9995010"," I want you to see this line right here. "
"9995090","9996470"," I don't like this line disappearing."
"9996470","9999970"," I don't like seeing that right there."
"10002130","10003310"," See if the gun lower. "
"10007320","10009040"," I don't like seeing that right there."
"10017370","10018410"," 463, 460."
"10019370","10020450"," I don't really get that low. "
"10046460","10047900"," 478, 480p."
"10047900","10048300"," These."
"10058910","10063630"," Roblox has some puts coming out January 7th, 97p. "
"10074160","10076020"," It's sold off ugly."
"10094280","10096240"," It's a nice sell off on Roblox."
"10096400","10097080"," I like Roblox. "
"10100000","10105120"," You can get Roblox down to like back to 60 or 70 of these stilt."
"10106200","10107280"," Buy that all day long."
"10129500","10137670"," Spy puts 474s now down to 50 cents. "
"10138850","10140230"," I like the price of spy put."
"10140490","10143350"," You know, spy 474s got down to like 30 cents."
"10143650","10144650"," 20, 30 cents of my buying. "
"10152520","10156380"," Maybe they were already at 30 cents at 47, 60 or 70."
"10231280","10233240"," 471, a Wednesday."
"10266250","10267490"," Or 70p. "
"10292400","10294780"," The dippers are strong here."
"10303640","10305040"," Very strong by the dippers."
"10321100","10339400"," By the dippers"
"10339400","10340860"," are savages right now. "
"10395800","10396740"," They're just second here."
"10397020","10397480"," We'll look at something."
"10457600","10459920"," You're the early candle right now in Spy. "
"10461220","10464720"," You've got 45 or 4.5 million."
"10467420","10469980"," Volume green bar just growing."
"10741240","10764680"," I think"
"10764680","10767460"," I'm going to be looking to buy a FRM here. "
"10768240","10770160"," Close to buying a FRM."
"10774170","10775770"," I can get it at 7304."
"10779760","10807460"," It's at 82.57. It's"
"10807460","10816700"," at 81.94. I want to see what it's looking like right now. "
"10845090","10846110"," It's at 82."
"10850510","10851030"," It's AF."
"10851330","10851810"," Our end down. "
"10852390","10858160"," Right down here."
"10859760","10867260"," 80.75. How deep can it go?"
"10871100","10871300"," 65."
"10873140","10875420"," How deep can that sound so bad?"
"10876480","10876900"," It's pretty good. "
"10882560","10884360"," We've got buyers at 80."
"10888570","10890530"," Next support, 7508."
"10891710","10894430"," And then 6576. "
"10902960","10904560"," Once there are earnings reports."
"10906080","10907440"," I don't have one yet, do they?"
"10912370","10914050"," They're pre-IP, aren't they?"
"10914790","10917990"," The earnings are February 10th."
"10923730","10924570"," February 10th. "
"10945520","10946220"," February 10th."
"10949520","10951160"," I don't think they're going to pin them, huh?"
"10952800","10956560"," I wonder if you could trade a firm with us with a butterfly."
"10958700","10961360"," It calls us stupidly overpriced. "
"10970910","10972810"," A ridiculous interest in a firm."
"10973170","10975070"," I remember when a firm started trading up, it was awesome."
"10976210","10976790"," Make good money. "
"10978570","10986780"," Make some January 28th."
"10986800","10987920"," Butterflies would be nice."
"10996510","11001250"," So you could do like a butterfly or fly somewhere down to 65. "
"11003090","11003430"," 100."
"11004190","11005810"," Let me see what that comes out to."
"11015490","11016870"," We say January. "
"11018170","11018850"," Mutual."
"11021670","11023410"," January 28th, let's say."
"11031690","11032750"," 6580s and 90s. "
"11032790","11034910"," That's a prankster trade."
"11044990","11054940"," So if you traded, if you traded an iron condor, I don't even"
"11054940","11056300"," know if that's better than the butterfly."
"11059870","11061070"," It's actually pretty good. "
"11065510","11066630"," You don't have to go."
"11067410","11067930"," It's 70."
"11068170","11069510"," You really wanted it like 60. "
"11072510","11074610"," That's too tight with butterfly."
"11076950","11081010"," We did like an iron condor on AFRM right now."
"11082450","11084630"," Aspiring January 28th. "
"11085710","11087290"," It's not really the best thing to do it on."
"11088110","11090390"," We did it on like the third week of January."
"11090970","11092710"," The third week of January. "
"11102290","11102770"," 3865."
"11103510","11104010"," I don't know."
"11109720","11110820"," That's not a good one either. "
"11115020","11117220"," I don't like that either."
"11118560","11119780"," Even that is the best day."
"11133140","11137420"," If you did like an iron condor, 6570, 94, 99. "
"11139020","11140900"," 6570, 94, 99."
"11143000","11144420"," Maybe a 6065."
"11147020","11148320"," Like a 100. "
"11149280","11150800"," 105 or something."
"11150800","11152540"," A wide spread iron condor."
"11153600","11156420"," It costs 313 bucks for the Prince 187. "
"11158240","11160180"," You're pretty much guaranteeing that."
"11161020","11163080"," You buy the dippers are down here at 66."
"11164480","11166000"," Actually, you just do it. "
"11166060","11169020"," You can just do it at 6570, 94, 99."
"11171480","11175680"," And as long as you stayed within 100 and 65."
"11176400","11178200"," AFRM has a tendency to load a rip. "
"11178200","11182860"," It can rip, but there's a ton of it's being shorted to help."
"11183820","11185420"," And there's a ton of puts on it."
"11187220","11189180"," I bet you it's going to get pinned in the zone. "
"11190360","11191060"," Into under January."
"11193640","11194120"," AFRM."
"11198250","11200570"," There is a contingent of dip buyers down here. "
"11201790","11202770"," That's at 80."
"11204810","11207090"," I don't know what the news is in AFRM right now."
"11207090","11208810"," It's if it's deal or glue or not. "
"11214030","11217430"," Yeah, that's the one problem is the volatility of AFRM."
"11218630","11220990"," Is there is volatility hands down."
"11221090","11222330"," I can't say that there isn't. "
"11222870","11225190"," But a spread about a condor that's like."
"11226330","11230610"," Lows you to trade up to like 95 to 100 and trade as far down as 65."
"11231830","11234150"," You probably have time to close it. "
"11235270","11237810"," You'd have to think about when is it going to start ripping."
"11239310","11240490"," It's going to start ripping."
"11244130","11244810"," I agree. "
"11245030","11246310"," There is volatility in AFRM."
"11246710","11248630"," That's the one downside."
"11250110","11251770"," Brad Kessner, gambling hotline. "
"11252870","11253410"," Left my ass off."
"11254510","11255610"," That's pretty good trade."
"11259670","11260630"," I do. "
"11260730","11261310"," I was not lagging."
"11261490","11261610"," Is it?"
"11261790","11263410"," I thought I was pulling pretty well."
"11266510","11268730"," So what do you guys paper trade that trade out there?"
"11269650","11270790"," Here's the paper trade, okay?"
"11271010","11272390"," Paper trade this trade and see what happens. "
"11272570","11274030"," I want to see if this trade works."
"11275530","11276490"," So wait a minute."
"11276670","11277630"," Did I get rid of that trade?"
"11278890","11280230"," When I used to call it a 65. "
"11281470","11281590"," Shit."
"11282610","11283670"," I just deleted the trade."
"11287020","11288540"," I got to put the trade back in again. "
"11291560","11292360"," Dang it."
"11294980","11296100"," That's a pretty fair trade."
"11296400","11296940"," That's the one thing. "
"11297160","11297920"," Whoever said that."
"11298520","11300380"," That there's a lot of volatility in AFRM."
"11300380","11302280"," I agree with that. "
"11302900","11304160"," There's a ton of volatility."
"11304640","11307320"," I made a lot of money on the run up on the FRM."
"11308660","11310960"," That was some serious money making on that trade. "
"11313180","11313800"," Let's see."
"11314380","11317900"," You do a neutral condor and then you do."
"11318840","11322620"," You make it a 65 70 and then a 95 100 iron condor. "
"11323140","11326480"," It's got a 70% probability of winning."
"11327840","11330820"," Cost 316 bucks to make 184 bucks."
"11333580","11337180"," Now, even though it has a 70% chance of winning, that does not take into account. "
"11337240","11341420"," I would say that that probability does not take into account."
"11345260","11346960"," AFRM's volatility because it can move."
"11347140","11351120"," AFM can move like 30 points in the, well, no, not 30 points. "
"11351320","11355000"," They're like 15, 15 solid points on a river, I think."
"11355000","11356400"," I don't know if that's what we remember it being."
"11357020","11358680"," I'll look back and see their best days. "
"11359960","11361100"," Like their best days."
"11362060","11366000"," We got 109 to 130 139."
"11366940","11368680"," So yeah, so you could do a 30 point day. "
"11370020","11371300"," On a FRM."
"11371620","11372140"," This is insane."
"11373100","11375860"," But a spread of 65 to 100. "
"11377320","11380760"," You could, you could, you could cut that thing loose before you lose any real money."
"11386460","11389040"," Bulls are like, I'm buying the dip on a FRM."
"11395210","11396410"," Yeah, it rips and dips. "
"11396410","11396830"," I agree."
"11398170","11401610"," You'd be more confident in some call spreads and heads with some low cost puts."
"11402210","11404770"," Yeah, you know, that would be, that would be nice. "
"11405010","11408930"," If you could buy, you know what else would be good is just buy the stock where it is right"
"11408930","11411130"," now and sell puts below 65."
"11412110","11414130"," And you'd be doing pretty well."
"11414130","11419450"," Even if the stock traded down to 65, you'd hold the value of what you paid for it at 80. "
"11419970","11420590"," That's a fit."
"11420850","11421790"," That's a really good idea."
"11421970","11423250"," But it's not like that idea to. "
"11425750","11427630"," Yeah, I don't think I WMS lagging at all."
"11427950","11430690"," So you can check I WMS in a channel right now."
"11431590","11436010"," Bullish reversal ice, even though we're in a bullish reversal that could have been a fake out on"
"11436010","11436630"," the corrective. "
"11437850","11439050"," Move of IWM."
"11439330","11440630"," I think I have you does come down."
"11440830","11442430"," I'm betting on IWM coming down to 208. "
"11443830","11448830"," That this second corrective move, a second corrective move began on December 8th."
"11449090","11450230"," And then it bottomed out at 208."
"11451210","11454710"," But I'm wondering if we get one more one more stab at it. "
"11455930","11458910"," History says we will get one more stab at it."
"11459270","11463430"," So I'm betting on those statistics statistically speaking between now and March."
"11463430","11467230"," We'll get one more stab at IWM at a bottom again. "
"11468530","11470170"," Some kind of a localized bottom."
"11471350","11478270"," Probably at 212 would be would be I'd start entering along again at 212."
"11479250","11482110"," Right now for today on IWM it's not lagging at all. "
"11482210","11483150"," It's not doing very well."
"11483470","11486870"," It had a great bounce off the channel that it's in on this weekly channel."
"11487410","11490990"," It's actually been brought five trading days, I think one, two. "
"11491350","11492470"," This is its third trading day."
"11492470","11496770"," And it just made its third tag on and on an ascending wedge."
"11497910","11501030"," Or not a wedge, but this is this is bullish contact. "
"11501350","11505170"," So you can trade out every room right now until right back to 227 again."
"11505710","11509250"," Pick up another call for 227 on IWM expiring Friday."
"11510030","11512910"," And you have a fair chance of it hitting maybe even next week. "
"11513170","11516810"," You just do it in the money spread where it's at right now."
"11516810","11520470"," And it's probably going to be there at some point in a week or above."
"11521590","11522250"," For now. "
"11523450","11525610"," Because we do have earnings season coming up."
"11531630","11535650"," Trying to run all these calculations on my bearish or bullish here."
"11536090","11537510"," And right now I'm not trading anything. "
"11537650","11539870"," I haven't picked up any trades on."
"11541010","11543510"," You have more buyers than sellers now in AFR."
"11543690","11544470"," I'm just by the way. "
"11545810","11548250"," If there are buyers stepping in here."
"11548930","11550850"," It is a major support that they're at right now."
"11550850","11551010"," It's a major support. "
"11551010","11551550"," And it just heads up."
"11552190","11555810"," So at $80 there is major support on a FRM."
"11557820","11560260"," 65 is greedy me wanting to buy the dip on them. "
"11562680","11564780"," Maybe you just set another set of line at 65."
"11565620","11568520"," If it comes down to 65, you know, you can probably buy it there."
"11571360","11572400"," Look at the spy again. "
"11575040","11577860"," And if you can't buy it at 65 and it just keeps ripping from 80."
"11578660","11579780"," You missed another one."
"11580040","11581500"," But if you do another, enough of these. "
"11585390","11587470"," Roblox is turning around as well now."
"11588650","11591050"," Roblox just had a nice bounce off 92."
"11591790","11592730"," We can check Roblox. "
"11599020","11600980"," It might be a nice buying opportunity as well."
"11605840","11607080"," These are both meta plays."
"11608160","11609420"," You guys hate Facebook. "
"11610640","11612880"," And you want to know what the real meta versus this is."
"11613160","11615780"," These are two of them are Roblox is one of those companies."
"11617900","11620060"," Generally speaking, Roblox is bullish. "
"11624080","11625560"," The trade might have cooled off now."
"11625800","11628080"," You guys want to trade for 2020 for 2022."
"11629080","11630400"," Roblox is still in that talk. "
"11631780","11634380"," For the next five years, you want to buy some stock for your kids."
"11635360","11636220"," Or for your future kids."
"11637540","11639300"," Yeah, see look, all the buyers are. "
"11640640","11641580"," Right here on Roblox."
"11642560","11644940"," You're pretty much at a bottom on Roblox right now."
"11645120","11647620"," We can get more granular and see if you can get it slightly cheaper. "
"11648880","11649640"," You see this right here?"
"11649800","11651200"," This is this is excellent."
"11651820","11653940"," See this hard support down here at $92."
"11655580","11657700"," That's a nice buy for Roblox. "
"11660280","11661240"," Buy some 92."
"11661860","11664480"," Just buy some stock and sell puts below."
"11671310","11673790"," We had a nice bounce back here on. "
"11675450","11677910"," December 16th and December 15th."
"11678850","11682530"," It looks like the trade was really picked up by the banks at $76."
"11684130","11686350"," But I don't see any buyers down there at 76. "
"11686750","11689290"," There's a lot of interest as well on Roblox here."
"11690350","11698710"," Me hoping that we get one more little buy zone right here at $90 $90.37. You've got some more"
"11698710","11700050"," buyers hanging out down below."
"11700210","11701170"," But that's not the smart money. "
"11701830","11703190"," The Roblox is moving up."
"11704150","11705030"," Can't deny that."
"11705310","11706910"," There's nobody down here at 75 anymore. "
"11707730","11711050"," So I put this at a bottom and put Roblox at a bottom right now."
"11715380","11717580"," Whoever called out Roblox after today."
"11717740","11719480"," I don't know if you guys you guys didn't call them up. "
"11720020","11723200"," Roblox and AFRM worth looking at right now."
"11725890","11729930"," At least do some due diligence on them and where they are in the market."
"11731250","11733810"," I don't think that that trade is over right now. "
"11734790","11738090"," And even if it was to trade down slightly more, let's say the market weakness."
"11738790","11742750"," I don't see Roblox staying at 90 bucks in three years."
"11747140","11747600"," Maybe. "
"11747900","11749680"," I guess if we had a market crash or something."
"11758620","11761700"," You'll probably see a meat Kevin video on it next day or two."
"11762440","11764100"," You'll see me Kevin break up breakout. "
"11764100","11768900"," No guy with us with a round rim rim hat over that guy is and he'll be up in Roblox."
"11773120","11774080"," This is a good price."
"11788180","11789060"," Henry Henry. "
"11789140","11793180"," He took Henry from me."
"11794120","11795140"," No love for me."
"11815530","11819790"," Let's find out why Palancers got so many puts on it. "
"11819790","11847350"," I don't know."
"11847530","11847730"," I don't know."
"11847730","11847870"," I don't know. "
"11847870","11848810"," I don't see lower on pound here."
"11850410","11851750"," And it's just going to be pinned."
"11852950","11860410"," Looks like there's some pinning coming on the market or pinning coming on ERs for somebody's"
"11860410","11861210"," speculative stocks. "
"11861650","11864630"," And you got buyers down here a pound here at 1751."
"11864630","11873290"," Looks like just more bullshit pinning."
"11875420","11876600"," It's at 1790. "
"11879700","11882160"," 1749 buyers 1701 buyers."
"11884400","11885720"," Palancers just shut the bed."
"11886660","11888000"," It's another one of those same stocks, right?"
"11888200","11889040"," Those are retail favorites. "
"11893540","11894620"," Checking on Tesla."
"11899320","11902040"," XLF is doing doing great today."
"11905400","11906340"," It's still up. "
"11906700","11907860"," Palancer just had a bounce."
"11913040","11914200"," It's pretty raw shit."
"11914400","11917860"," Rock got cheap, like 1790, 1750. "
"11918540","11920420"," XLF has taken off once more again."
"11921140","11925420"," They've been consolidating since 11 o'clock this morning."
"11926360","11928320"," The past hour and a half. "
"11932990","11934830"," XLE just made a comeback as well."
"11935590","11937370"," XLE XLF for some good trades today."
"11940690","11941910"," GME was a good trade. "
"11943250","11944530"," Ford was a good trade."
"11945690","11948390"," So you have GME Ford, XLE XLF."
"11950970","11952670"," IMTC is recovering now. "
"11953910","11955690"," They found a bottom down there at $52."
"11959430","11964730"," You saw those IMTC calls come in that I think it was IMTC golden ticket, right?"
"11964730","11968270"," Okay, a minute at some point."
"11968810","11970330"," Tap twice, now moving higher. "
"11978030","11982510"," AMC is still trying to drill, but I don't think it's going anywhere."
"11982810","11986150"," I think 25 is about where bottom is right now on AMC."
"11988710","11990130"," Roblox is turning around. "
"11991770","11993130"," Palantir is turning around."
"11998600","12000260"," The zone just keeps pumping."
"12005530","12007950"," Our case sold down to $90. "
"12008490","12009770"," Can I get our K at 75?"
"12010850","12012610"," I really want our K at 75."
"12013610","12015730"," That does the capitulation move in our K."
"12019410","12021350"," Today, there's 10 million sellers."
"12022670","12025490"," This is the second time it's bounced off a look less. "
"12025690","12027710"," That's three taps right now."
"12027970","12028870"," One, well, four, I guess."
"12029750","12032990"," Two, three, and this would be number four. "
"12037010","12040490"," I still want our K at like 75 bucks and I buy it all day long."
"12040770","12041930"," I don't think we'd get to 60."
"12042590","12045470"," 60 would be the low end on our K."
"12046430","12049730"," The 91 is not bad. "
"12059100","12060240"," Amazon, same thing."
"12060600","12062660"," You're watching all these bottoming."
"12063160","12066980"," It's like you got Amazon had Amazon on 12, three, right?"
"12066980","12067600"," Summer third. "

"12071860","12080960"," It hit again on December 14, December 15, December 16, December 17, December 21."
"12081700","12089040"," They did it again just now on the opening valley on the third and now again on the fourth. "
"12096480","12097900"," Interesting on Amazon."

"12156900","12159320"," The one if you are a Tesla bull when you watch. "
"12160680","12163320"," The 1150 being defended like it is."
"12164800","12171640"," You've got sellers being worn out above and your price target is once again 1195 1200."
"12172180","12175500"," This is a very bullish move for Tesla defending this 1150. "
"12176960","12178600"," It's a beautiful thing to see right here."
"12179600","12184460"," This is not does not build welfare bears to see this defending of the 1150 mark."
"12186160","12187620"," Keep your eyes on Amazon. "

"12240400","12241540"," And trade it my own."
"12242980","12243820"," Shouldn't have said that right. "
"12244100","12248600"," I don't know."
"12251220","12253360"," So your price target above is 1200."
"12256070","12262070"," You are breaking through this resistance level right now and tested 1161.99. I'm going to have to"
"12262070","12262690"," enter a trade here. "
"12265100","12268060"," Amazon as well as looking outstanding right now."
"12268900","12274640"," I can end the money call spread on Amazon leading into the ER at this price right here."
"12275420","12280980"," It's insane and cheap. "
"12282720","12287410"," I mean, look at that wall of support down here for Amazon."
"12290730","12292310"," It's a great, great place to buy Amazon."
"12293130","12294550"," And this is a bank hedge. "
"12296550","12299930"," If they sell Amazon, if they really sell Amazon, you're talking about."
"12301630","12302890"," That's the end of the market, right?"
"12306700","12310560"," Test up by a dipper stepping in Amazon by the dipper stepping in."
"12310560","12320540"," Get a 3300 33 like a 3300 3300"
"12320540","12323400"," call spread heavily in the money. "

"12326100","12336020"," That'll be the market being sold means are selling the entire market."
"12337620","12347600"," Probably not happening until after the price target is still 1200 on"
"12347600","12348060"," Tesla. "
"12350580","12353400"," We had a price target of 1190 earlier."
"12354160","12357560"," But it looks like we've exhausted some of those sellers, panic sellers."
"12359830","12368470"," So we're going to go with, we just broke through these sellers here at 1162 price target 1200. "
"12372730","12373710"," Good morning, guys."

"12415460","12417140"," Yeah, no, no."
"12417740","12421600"," So this is a bullish context for Tesla, whether you like it or not."
"12422080","12422740"," That's what it is. "
"12423200","12426280"," They just destroyed the sellers at 1150."
"12427120","12428080"," Reclaimed 1150."
"12428600","12431840"," What that says is that they're building supported 1150. "
"12431840","12434740"," You've got blue skies above 1200."
"12453240","12455540"," And, of course, what do we see on AMC?"
"12456080","12458000"," Same thing we talked about just a few minutes ago."
"12458820","12463960"," You've got dip buyers stepping in a 2464 and it's starting to green bar itself. "
"12465040","12466540"," That is a place to buy AMC."
"12466920","12468500"," All the buyers had shown up at $25."
"12473460","12474740"," Palancers catching a bid. "

"12477020","12480040"," Roblox, maybe not catching a bid yet."
"12480760","12481760"," Keep your eyes on Roblox. "
"12482360","12483800"," AMC though, catching a bid."
"12485680","12489500"," INTC is just one giant green bar at this point."
"12489940","12492280"," That was a golden ticket that I posted on Twitter this morning. "

"12527550","12528710"," I like IWM here still."
"12536900","12538200"," XLP and XLU. "
"12538640","12540660"," I thought those would have sold at this point."
"12541520","12544160"," I don't like that XLU and XLP keep going up."
"12546550","12547930"," XLU is selling off slightly. "
"12548750","12550490"," But XLP is still holding in there."
"12554300","12557020"," Consumer staples are just still keep just pumping."
"12558180","12559200"," Did a dip a little bit. "
"12559360","12562260"," Did a dip yesterday, but they rode real high and nice today."
"12562260","12568960"," I like seeing financials taking over though."
"12569240","12570820"," I want to see financials taking over. "
"12585230","12587150"," It's a nice chart on Tesla right here, huh?"
"12587550","12588170"," It's a beautiful chart."
"12589130","12589990"," It looks gorgeous."
"12590590","12591270"," Good job to the bulls. "

"12658320","12660520"," You know why I'm bringing Oracle up for hutch?"
"12661240","12662280"," Because he sticks around."
"12662920","12665680"," That guy's in the chat box all day long every day."
"12667540","12670120"," I'm going to hook up Oracle for hutch. "
"12670340","12671520"," That guy's always asking questions."

"12736570","12739270"," Buy at 88, 32. "

"12779150","12779890"," Hutch is engaged. "
"12784280","12787630"," I just sold my calls at 35%."
"12788150","12788490"," Okay."
"12788570","12789070"," Hutch, you're out. "
"12789290","12790030"," Are you out of Oracle?"
"12794790","12795190"," Yeah."
"12795530","12798330"," So do I have some issues with book map by streaming it live?"
"12798630","12798730"," Okay."
"12798730","12802810"," So Jason, I'm going to answer some questions for you specifically and some of you out there. "
"12803330","12812790"," So I am currently today at some point, I had to order some equipment."
"12815630","12818770"," So you, so I have a very good computer, but."
"12819790","12824370"," The computing power that it takes to stream and 1080p. "
"12826230","12830270"," Then to, it's like the streaming itself is expensive or is taxing."
"12830730","12836090"," Then I have monitors off that computer attacks the GPU."
"12837030","12840410"," Then I have a book map running on it. "
"12840550","12843030"," So book map takes takes up anywhere."
"12843370","12845110"," They claim four to six gigs."
"12846070","12851330"," But if it goes up to like eight to 10 gigs of power, which is taxing. "
"12851330","12855790"," So I purchased some stuff that I can."
"12857270","12861910"," I can create a dual or triple PC setup."
"12862370","12868010"," I can run the streaming on one computer, run book map on a separate computer, but to connect them"
"12868010","12869410"," all together, I needed some equipment. "
"12869930","12872590"," So I just bought some Elgato equipment to do that."
"12873470","12879510"," So in the next day or two, if I can work out whatever bugs arise from tonight or tomorrow."
"12880030","12883350"," I should be able to get a very clear stream for you guys. "
"12883590","12885070"," Plus that I'm running flow."
"12885290","12885470"," I'll go."
"12885670","12885990"," I'm running. "
"12887370","12889070"," A new squawk service."
"12889890","12891890"," I'm running charting software."
"12892790","12894350"," I'm running my own trading. "
"12895010","12895670"," Free bro."
"12895870","12898970"," I'm trading on three different brokerage brokerages, depending on the trades I'm putting on."
"12900310","12902430"," And then I've got a bunch of other stuff. "
"12902690","12903290"," I've got a camera."
"12903970","12909650"," That's running off this computer and then adding a Sony a 6000 today or tomorrow or the next couple"
"12909650","12909850"," days."
"12909850","12911990"," I'm waiting on a new lens to come in for it. "
"12912510","12914450"," And some connections for that as well."
"12914610","12915910"," Another Elgato connection device."
"12916770","12920590"," But while I'm scaling this, I'm also looking into buying. "
"12921410","12924430"," Blade servers to just run it all off a server."
"12924430","12927130"," And I'm going to have Joe donut."
"12928070","12932650"," Hopefully the guys from this company helped me to maybe get my own IP address. "
"12933370","12936590"," To run all this off, but it costs, you know, probably I'm done."
"12936730","12938030"," It's probably going to cost me like 10 grand."
"12938630","12940190"," To set up a legit system. "
"12940850","12941850"," And get this."
"12941850","12943390"," I got this stuff out to you properly."
"12943730","12944330"," Maybe five grand. "
"12944750","12945870"," Five to $10,000."
"12946670","12947750"," Somewhere there when I'm done."
"12948710","12950150"," So I'm in the process of doing this. "
"12950250","12952730"," I've only had this channel going for a couple weeks, like two, three weeks."
"12953490","12956070"," So it's just going to take me a, it's going to take me a week or two."
"12956730","12958730"," Three weeks to get all this up and running for you guys. "
"12959330","12964890"," So that it's, uh, it's probably better than most of the guarantee that within a week or two."
"12965550","12971230"," And once I get the classes out, I've actually this content is better than your $600 and $1,000 a"
"12971230","12971390"," month."
"12972270","12973810"," Subs that you guys pay for out there. "
"12973910","12975690"," I know you guys pay for some ridiculous subs."
"12977170","12980530"," I know some of you, or you some of you at least have experience doing that."
"12982440","12985780"," So we're going to try to make this a free sub by donation only. "
"12986700","12993000"," And also try to attract a mix of new traders so that new traders and experience traders can help"
"12993000","12993360"," each other."
"12994760","12996580"," Not a negative guy when it comes to training."
"12996740","12998080"," I want all of retail to make money. "
"12998360","12999540"," You guys aren't taking money from each other."
"12999560","13000740"," You guys are taking money from the banks."
"13001820","13008780"," I see too much snarkiness on many discord's and I see too much snarkiness in trading rooms. "
"13010060","13015560"," And, uh, I don't, I'm not, I'm not a poison, like I'm not a, I'm not a poisonous person, right?"
"13015700","13020380"," I don't like to poison conversations or not explain things where people don't understand them."
"13020600","13024840"," So if we can offer something like this to regular traders out there, that's what we're going to do."
"13025480","13028660"," And so it's going to take me a week or two to get this stuff to right now. "
"13028660","13030120"," It's kind of kind of Jimmy Reg, right?"
"13030600","13033380"," And I need to wait for some of this equipment to come in the mail."
"13039640","13040980"," Yeah, we did and canceled it."
"13043040","13044360"," What are you guys writing over here?"
"13044520","13045000"," Well, in a second. "
"13048290","13048890"," The cap."
"13049190","13050050"," I don't think any of us care though."
"13050370","13051430"," So respected though. "
"13052330","13053910"," That's why I'm making him clean up his act."
"13058190","13058910"," Oh, licensing."
"13060230","13061250"," I pay for the license. "
"13062130","13063790"," I pay a lot of money for the license."
"13064490","13065010"," I don't know."
"13065330","13066230"," Maybe I'll get in trouble. "
"13068330","13069990"," If I get in trouble, I'll dump it."
"13074410","13077270"," Yeah, I'm wondering if I'm wondering if I'm allowed to put display it publicly."
"13079130","13080270"," I'll have to check right now. "
"13080450","13081110"," Let me look and see."
"13081750","13085090"," That'll be, you know, I'm going to write that down right now and find out if I can display it"
"13085090","13085330"," publicly."
"13085850","13086430"," I'm not sure. "
"13086850","13088470"," I mean, can you display weeble publicly?"
"13088870","13090630"," Can you display think or swim publicly?"
"13091670","13093530"," Can you, is there anything that you can't display publicly?"
"13093850","13094210"," I'm not sure."
"13094930","13096310"," I'm not charging anybody for it."
"13097050","13098350"," Can I not display it?"
"13098430","13098590"," I'm not. "
"13098750","13100210"," I mean, I'm going to look into that this afternoon."
"13103940","13104900"," That's a good question."
"13109390","13112410"," There are quite a few book map live streams on YouTube. "
"13113470","13114230"," Yeah, I don't."
"13114490","13117170"," I'm unsure because I don't charge for the content."
"13118710","13119510"," I don't. "
"13121850","13123910"," Yeah, the donations are putting a dent in the costs."
"13124050","13124430"," Absolutely."
"13124730","13125030"," You got, dude. "
"13125170","13128750"," I'm stoked that you guys donate to me more than you know, like you have no idea."
"13128750","13131410"," It keeps me motivated to want to keep doing this stuff."
"13131870","13133270"," So it helps all day long. "
"13133670","13136490"," And I know who you guys are out there that helped them support this channel."
"13136990","13140710"," And there's a, there's a core group of you that are supporting this channel out there."
"13142750","13146170"," But I'm going to look at it tonight and find out if I can display it, but it does beg"
"13146170","13146970"," the question like. "
"13147530","13152350"," Do you know a single YouTuber out there anywhere that doesn't display stuff?"
"13152510","13155230"," Maybe like a me Kevin might not display stuff because he's so big."
"13155230","13164750"," I think if you look around on the internet, most traders are displaying some form of a charting"
"13164750","13165770"," software."
"13166210","13167470"," I don't know how to check though. "
"13168250","13169530"," I'm going to check tonight."
"13169670","13171250"," I bet somewhere it says I can't."
"13172130","13173710"," I'd have to do an incognito, I guess. "
"13174890","13176610"," Sign up with a mustache and glasses."
"13184400","13185220"," Yeah, that's the other thing."
"13185460","13188420"," So Jason on that topic too. "
"13189060","13193120"," So like I'm eligible right now to chart or to do advertising on YouTube."
"13193860","13196180"," Like they keep asking me, do you want to do want to start running ads?"
"13196500","13199380"," Do you want to start, you know, all this other shit to make money?"
"13199480","13202000"," And I'm like, no, I don't want you guys."
"13202360","13205580"," Like if I watch a YouTube ad on a video on YouTube, it drives me insane. "
"13210150","13213690"," So I haven't signed up for any of the common YouTube things."
"13214190","13218510"," I don't really care about making money on the YouTube side of things or the YouTube advertising"
"13218510","13219690"," programs that they have."
"13220710","13223150"," I'll never saw you guys merchandise or any of that crap. "
"13223510","13224750"," You guys never see me post."
"13225270","13230790"," I think maybe once I posted an affiliate link, but you'll never see me generally speaking post like"
"13230790","13234670"," affiliate links to trading platforms or flow platforms."
"13235490","13238190"," I don't really, I try not to do any of this undercover. "
"13238890","13243030"," I have a real bone to pick with for profit."
"13244290","13249390"," Shouldn't say that, but like for profit type of subscription services."
"13249950","13254170"," I feel like there's always this undercurrent of trying to take money from people rather than"
"13254170","13256330"," trading, focusing on trading. "
"13256330","13262010"," So I limit the money to donations or tips or donations."
"13262750","13264890"," I don't sell any swag."
"13265210","13265990"," I don't sell. "
"13266270","13267770"," I don't give you guys affiliate links."
"13268030","13271590"," I don't try to push products during the live stream and I don't allow YouTube to."
"13272110","13273070"," For advertising at you guys. "
"13277590","13278470"," Yeah, no ads."
"13278770","13279850"," I don't do any of that ad shit."
"13280030","13297600"," They asked me if I want to enroll in the ad program and I'm not down with"
"13297600","13297600"," that. "
"13299020","13301500"," Yeah, so I got, I think I got, what did I buy?"
"13302580","13303220"," I bought a new lens."
"13304540","13306180"," Not the lens that I was talking about yesterday."
"13306880","13308040"," Someone's talking to me right now. "
"13308680","13312440"," I wound up buying a sigma about a sigma."
"13312640","13313280"," Let me see what I bought."
"13315770","13316550"," So I bought yesterday. "
"13316950","13321830"," So I had a lens that was a 16 to 50, but I had a really crappy 3.5 F"
"13321830","13322390"," on it."
"13323550","13324890"," What did I buy last night?"
"13325090","13327950"," So this guy Joe donut sent me down a rabbit hole in lenses last night."
"13330030","13334030"," And the middle of the night, I had a, I was like, you know, like the middle of the night. "
"13335090","13335810"," Dreaming or whatever."
"13336790","13338710"," And I'm like, I can't look, I can't buy."
"13338830","13340850"," I can't not buy a nice lens. "
"13341790","13342530"," So what did I buy?"
"13342870","13343410"," Let me see what I bought."
"13352900","13354440"," Tell you guys what I bought for a lens."
"13354800","13356120"," I knew you camera fishing out. "
"13356160","13356680"," I was up there."
"13357800","13365380"," I bought a sigma 30 millimeter F 1.4 lens for a Sony E."
"13372200","13382010"," So a sigma 30 millimeter F 1.4. That should look sexy like, it should look"
"13382010","13384690"," sexy like like Joe donut's zoom calls."
"13391590","13393770"," Well, let me go back to where you guys are talking. "
"13397720","13398640"," Not like you, Cap."
"13400580","13401600"," Thanks for the donation."
"13402180","13402920"," I appreciate it, Chris. "
"13403360","13404260"," Yeah, the setup's not cheap."
"13404260","13404900"," It's expensive."
"13405840","13411380"," Like my normal, just my training stuff for myself, like alone is anywhere from 10 to 15 grand, like"
"13411380","13412860"," 12,000, 13,000 a year. "
"13413460","13418740"," And then I had to increase my internet, started building out a studio space, started buying lights"
"13418740","13425080"," and cameras and more computers and also stuff so that we can upscale this to a legit operation."
"13430520","13431740"," You can display it."
"13431800","13437300"," You're not sharing the application sporky saying the licensing is for the application, not a video"
"13437300","13438120"," feed of your screen. "
"13439280","13440960"," You too money can be pretty good."
"13441240","13443240"," Yeah, like YouTube money can be very good."
"13443320","13444120"," It can be very lucrative. "
"13444940","13446880"," And, but I'm not looking for lucrative."
"13447060","13450540"," I'm just looking for paying, if I can pay for the time that I'm doing this, keep me happy, pay"
"13450540","13454060"," for the equipment, and for like the internet and all that kind of crap, I'll be stoked."
"13454060","13456140"," Like I'm happy if that's paid for. "
"13456580","13457940"," I'll be on here every day with you guys."
"13458660","13460360"," That, that keeps me fine and happy."
"13463760","13467980"," Check that the 50 millimeter focal length is good for the view that you want. "
"13468500","13476060"," Yeah, so the, I was getting by the 16 millimeter with the 1.4 on that sigma and the 30"
"13476060","13477100"," about the 30, right?"
"13478320","13484970"," The 30 millimeter, excuse me, the 30 millimeter."
"13485190","13490810"," So my camera would be set up two meters away from me, almost like six feet or five to six"
"13490810","13496410"," feet away from me, which is the same zoom as the 16 millimeter."
"13496890","13497470"," Camera lens. "
"13498090","13500670"," So I wound up with the 50 for my camera would be located."
"13502910","13505370"," Trust me, Joe, I went down the draft rabbit hole last night, brother."
"13506090","13507250"," I went down the rabbit hole. "
"13509860","13510640"," Yeah, I got you."
"13512020","13517940"," I got the 30 millimeter sigma 1.4 or f 1.4. So I got that blurry background."
"13522230","13523810"," Yeah, and I am creating cut costs. "
"13523950","13526230"," I actually a bunch of you guys have gotten out and gotten book map."
"13526230","13532050"," So I am getting some, some business for book map and I haven't done an affiliate link with them."
"13532390","13537010"," I don't, I try not to do that, like, undercover your selling stuff thing. "
"13537830","13541390"," You think the amount of capital you invested in your step is drastically improved your earnings."
"13541950","13542250"," Yes."
"13542930","13550530"," So my regular training set up has made me a very, like, I don't work anymore. "
"13550530","13554630"," I flip houses, but other than that, like, I don't really work anymore."
"13555990","13558970"," You guys over heard a conversation with one of my workers yesterday, right?"
"13559350","13562270"," When my workers came in and he was poor, not poor, but he was broke."
"13562850","13563870"," There was no work for him. "
"13564550","13566150"," And he needed some money, right?"
"13566330","13568090"," So I was able to take care of my worker, right?"
"13568670","13571570"," And he was coming over to see if he could help with some of the construction on this new house."
"13573170","13575170"," So, yeah, I do it, I do it well."
"13575510","13576850"," Like, I don't have to do the work myself. "
"13578770","13586810"," The setup that, the setup that I pay for that makes me money is so I pay for book map."
"13587570","13590830"," I pay for futures and DX, the full futures packages."
"13591410","13592510"," There's like one or two. "
"13594630","13599030"," One or two, or there's like, these different packages that pay for the expensive one pay for the DX"
"13599030","13600470"," fee to pay for the hero indicator."
"13601770","13605030"," That stuff all comes off like 500 bucks a month, three to 500 a month."
"13606350","13607350"," That's no joke, right?"
"13607990","13611370"," That's like three to four grand for just charting for just charting. "
"13612810","13615630"," Then I pay for flow, that's not cheap."
"13615890","13617070"," I don't know what that costs a month."
"13617070","13618750"," Like, what is that a month?"
"13618910","13620290"," Like 150 bucks or something stupid?"
"13620790","13621790"," I don't, I don't remember. "

"13639630","13640530"," That's 1200 a year."
"13641330","13642450"," It's right there you're talking about."

"13653690","13654450"," Book map."
"13656290","13659130"," And then I pay for a new squawk. "
"13659230","13662430"," That's like 300 bucks a month that I pay for."
"13663030","13664190"," What else do I pay for?"
"13664950","13666070"," I don't pay for taste."
"13666250","13667090"," I pay for my trades. "
"13668150","13671630"," But I use tasty trade because the broke because the helpline is good."
"13672610","13673630"," What else do I pay for?"
"13673970","13675570"," I kind of think of anything else that I pay for."
"13675710","13680250"," Just my internet and I bought a bunch of, I have a bunch of laptops and displays that I can"
"13680250","13681030"," take anywhere I want. "
"13681550","13682690"," Internet's like a hundred bucks a month."
"13683310","13684050"," So what is that?"
"13684190","13685190"," 1200 a year on that?"

"13700600","13703100"," So that's expensive. "
"13703620","13704040"," It's not cheap."
"13705700","13706980"," And then I got to spend the time doing this."
"13707220","13708200"," I do my research every night. "
"13708600","13712560"," I started out doing just a daily brief that was just typed in every night on Twitter."
"13713140","13715320"," Before that I was on Wall Street Bats and Vegas Bats."
"13716240","13720560"," And then I went on to, I finally left because I was disgusted with the Astro Turfing. "
"13721580","13723660"," And I was the original Wall Street better."
"13725320","13726740"," For many, many, many moons ago."
"13729430","13730950"," And now I'm doing this. "
"13733130","13734810"," So yeah, does it help me as a trader?"
"13735150","13735330"," Absolutely."
"13735710","13736510"," But does it cost money?"
"13736750","13737690"," Yes, cost money."
"13738070","13740650"," You have to make be making money to be paying for the stuff. "
"13741370","13742030"," Because it's not cheap."
"13750710","13752430"," So Brad's saying he needs a better flow."
"13752790","13754650"," This option strategy isn't cutting it. "
"13757390","13760910"," Yeah, if you watch Flow Algo for a solid month."
"13761770","13763710"," You have to, you have to understand Flow Algo."
"13764650","13768850"," But Flow Algo is pretty much, if you want to enter a trade for that day. "
"13768850","13773250"," And if you want to enter golden tickets, it's a no brainer."
"13776390","13778070"," It was IMTC mood news."
"13781050","13781770"," Yeah, right. "
"13781930","13783650"," So right now I'm struggling right now."
"13783650","13785690"," So I need to create a better schedule."
"13786410","13792230"," And I also need to get this, this, this dual PC set up going so that I can actually just"
"13792230","13794830"," trade while I run this stream during the day. "
"13794850","13798750"," And right now I can't trade and stream because of how it's set up."
"13798750","13803290"," You know, I tried black box."
"13803690","13809690"," I tried, I want you guys all to know that I've paid for every known sub out there subscription. "
"13810550","13813470"," I've paid for classes, a lot of money."
"13814890","13816130"," I'm not going to name names."
"13817330","13820450"," I've paid for probably the top 10 flow services, 10. "
"13821250","13823630"," I've played for paid for like five different news services."
"13825290","13829110"," I've paid for, I've used every brokerage under the sun."
"13829110","13830770"," You name it like ninja. "
"13831850","13834590"," I've used, I got book map here."
"13835270","13837210"," I've used thinkorswim."
"13837910","13839750"," I pay for thinkorswim every month. "
"13839810","13840250"," Not thinkorswim."
"13840370","13842630"," I pay for trading view every month too."
"13842910","13843470"," I forgot about that. "
"13844150","13847250"," Pay $79 a month trading view as another cost."
"13847490","13848410"," That's some of the grand every year."
"13850470","13852590"," Should be telling you guys what I spend for my trading. "
"13853290","13854450"," But I paid for everything."
"13854770","13856890"," I've gone through and tried every single service out there."
"13856890","13862070"," I get lost in a lot of these options, these call option services. "
"13862810","13868430"," I feel like there's so much information that it's not directed into an exact trade."
"13869190","13870290"," And flow, I'll go what it does."
"13870490","13871810"," You might miss some of the best trades. "
"13872590","13874930"," Some days, like let's say one out of five days, you miss the best trades."
"13875570","13878350"," But the other four days, there's always a solid trade in there."
"13887100","13890020"," So I've learned, so I learned from a market maker how to trade. "
"13891640","13892220"," Wait a minute."
"13894680","13896120"," This I started learning how to trade."
"13896380","13896540"," So. "
"13897980","13901360"," What I did was I started way back in the day when Bitcoin."
"13902280","13906420"," First came online and I was an early adopter of Bitcoin when it was worth pennies."
"13906980","13908740"," And I was a I was a burner. "
"13908780","13910360"," So I got a burning man and stuff like that."
"13910560","13911140"," I was part of the."
"13913280","13914700"," The occupy Wall Street. "
"13915740","13918580"," Movements before when it was first, first movement."
"13919420","13923680"," And they had this big thing at well at Burning Man and knock our back by Wall Street."
"13925620","13927220"," Theme at Burning Man. "
"13927960","13928900"," Many years ago."
"13929380","13934340"," And so I learned about Bitcoin at that time, all the all the Silicon Valley boys were hanging out"
"13934340","13936240"," down there when they were nobody would nobody knew who they were."
"13936980","13940280"," And you know, you just you learn about this stuff, right?"
"13940460","13941020"," So that I adopted. "
"13942500","13943240"," Silk Road."
"13943960","13945740"," And use Bitcoin for Silk Road."
"13946440","13949860"," And then, of course, I got older and grew out of that phase of my life and. "
"13951440","13954540"," Started to trade on Wall Street Bets."
"13955100","13955200"," So."
"13956380","13959440"," Traded learning and failing and Wall Street Bets for many years. "
"13959760","13961000"," Eventually, I became a good trader."
"13961000","13965800"," A good enough where I was noticed by some core group of traders on Wall Street Bets."
"13966600","13970660"," And they invited me into a sub called Vegas Bets. "
"13971560","13972980"," And I'm not going to name names for those guys."
"13973120","13974660"," Some of you guys out there might know who those people are."
"13975280","13977980"," So I went into their sub, their private. "
"13979180","13980380"," Private, private Reddit."
"13981380","13982620"," Sub, I guess, subreddit."
"13983500","13985240"," And those guys taught me really how to trade. "
"13985680","13987740"," Those guys are, we're all professionals in there."
"13987740","13989560"," We're not all, but it was a good mix of professionals."
"13990480","13994080"," And those guys taught me how to trade in the early years of Wall Street Bets. "
"13994500","13997440"," So I spent almost a decade in Wall Street Bets."
"13998200","14002360"," And then, or before the GME thing, like December, January, it was November."
"14003460","14007420"," It was like when I ended up getting, I had like three accounts on Reddit. "
"14008480","14011700"," And my 12 year accounts, I think a 12 year old accountant Reddit."
"14011700","14018260"," And I was permanently banned from the, I shouldn't be telling any of these stories."
"14019080","14021260"," My 12 year old accounts on Reddit was banned. "
"14021960","14029500"," Perma banned by the moderator, the head moderator of the Nikola subreddit of Reddit."
"14030260","14036520"," He had come into Wall Street Bets and was, was saying that we shouldn't be carpet."
"14037840","14040260"," Astro-trafing his subreddit or something like that. "
"14040520","14043840"," And I had responded to him to go F himself."
"14044820","14046420"," Because of the fraud that was going on."
"14046620","14052120"," I wasn't a trader of Nikola, but I was very upset at how many traders got burned on that fraud. "
"14052880","14055060"," And he was still defending that, that company."
"14055740","14057540"," And so I got permanently banned."
"14058720","14061240"," And then they went in and took away all my accounts on Reddit. "
"14061580","14065120"," I was so pissed off that I switched over to Twitter."
"14068940","14073740"," No, no, Vegas Bets is a private sub within Wall Street Bets."
"14074920","14077340"," These, this is all old school Wall Street Bets stuff. "
"14082620","14083340"," Oh yeah."
"14083600","14084540"," Oh yeah, GME."
"14084780","14084960"," Yeah. "
"14085160","14086980"," So I've got a Twitter history about GME."
"14087320","14091240"," I owned GME at five bucks and 20 bucks and 15 bucks."
"14091240","14092220"," Twenty five dollars. "
"14092840","14094460"," I have a history on Twitter for that too."
"14095060","14096640"," So I was in that whole crew people."
"14100220","14101940"," And some of you guys probably don't know. "
"14102020","14102520"," This is like 155."
"14102840","14104020"," You guys listen right now."
"14104280","14106780"," I bet that one to five of you know what I'm talking about. "
"14110340","14111040"," Story time."
"14111560","14113040"," So yeah, so those guys taught me how to trade."
"14113300","14115240"," I had a prop trader teach me. "
"14115800","14117500"," I had a hedge fund guy teach me."
"14117600","14117900"," I'm not going to."
"14117980","14120460"," There's one guy you guys probably know out there. "
"14120460","14122220"," Sator helped teach me."
"14122280","14123660"," If any of you guys know who Sator is."
"14124140","14124700"," He taught. "
"14124900","14126480"," He picked me up and took me along."
"14127240","14128080"," I taught me how to trade."
"14129300","14130240"," He's a hedge fund guy. "
"14130920","14133740"," And then I had one more mentor out there."
"14133980","14135620"," I've got a YouTube mentor."
"14136120","14137300"," There's a guy that I follow on YouTube. "
"14137720","14140260"," I really like Bob Kendall."
"14141140","14143880"," I haven't been watching him recently, but I really like his stuff."
"14144460","14145700"," He's an old school market maker. "
"14145700","14148020"," I don't know him, but I've met him."
"14148220","14152020"," I've met him not in person, but I've talked to him before."
"14152800","14157740"," Now, if you guys should follow him on YouTube, I don't really recommend too many follows on"
"14157740","14159400"," YouTube, but I recommend him. "
"14159400","14160260"," I watch his stuff."
"14161440","14164860"," He's a very wise man, older guy, a lot of time in the market."
"14165140","14165980"," I usually vote. "
"14165980","14170240"," Now, whenever all the due diligence that I do, I do all my due diligence."
"14170460","14171220"," Then I look at the book map."
"14171380","14172040"," I look at spot gamma. "
"14172360","14173480"," I pay for spot gamma too."
"14174100","14174940"," I use spot gamma."
"14175480","14175920"," I forgot them. "
"14176440","14176840"," Pay them."

"14177380","14179000"," I have their professional one. "
"14179480","14181460"," It's like 75 bucks a month or some, maybe bucks a month."
"14184320","14190660"," And I'll put all that stuff together every night and then I used to watch Bob every night so that"
"14190660","14194520"," I could compare my notes to his and see what I was missing."
"14194520","14197660"," He was really the last piece of my puzzle. "
"14198120","14201260"," I haven't been watching him recently because I don't want to be influenced by him."
"14201740","14203580"," I don't want to have that overlap anymore."
"14203780","14205500"," If I'm going to do a channel of any kind. "
"14207680","14209100"," Because I don't want to be stealing content."

"14223700","14225440"," thinking or saying or putting out there. "

"14282820","14286860"," someone that I if there's someone that I've watched different YouTube channels over the years, you"
"14286860","14287720"," know, everybody does it."
"14287980","14290060"," Everybody falls in watching YouTube channels. "
"14291260","14296440"," If there was one guy out there that's been spot on he's missed a few big calls."
"14297280","14300320"," But, but if you were to look at Bob Kendall versus everyone else."
"14301960","14303760"," His his batting average beats. "

"14331560","14334420"," Well, I used to watch Mr. Yen the regular and Bob Kendall the regular."
"14334860","14341060"," And the when I started doing my my typed up reports, I stopped watching Mr Yen because he was he"
"14341060","14342320"," was creeping into my reports."
"14343040","14344320"," And I was like, I can't do that. "
"14344500","14346040"," I can't take other people's stuff."
"14346600","14350700"," Well, I can't you want to do research from other people, but I felt bad like I love Mr Yen."

"14502440","14502940"," Well, they care."
"14503240","14504040"," Like I care about Tesla."

"14694740","14695260"," Excuse me. "
"14697860","14699680"," I need to drink some water or some."
"14701180","14702700"," I mean you trust me."
"14702860","14703980"," Mr. Yen is not for everybody. "
"14704760","14706320"," I know he's not for everybody out there."
"14711210","14712670"," I was I was born in Boston."
"14713730","14716470"," I haven't lived there in many many years, but I was born in Boston. "
"14719330","14722330"," And sometimes when someone hates you, they actually love you."
"14722610","14724170"," If you're from Boston, you understand that."
"14725550","14729030"," So this Viacom trade, we talked about buying it at $29, right?"
"14730390","14734570"," We talked about ad nauseam into the new year, even in December. "
"14734850","14737810"," Matter of fact, I had a conversation with at volatility was about this."
"14738210","14741730"," I said, I said the trade into the new year is Viacom."
"14741990","14743870"," And why is it the trade into the new year?"
"14745470","14748670"," Now we just had a we just had a dip again down at 30 bucks. "
"14749750","14753650"," And you could have traded every one of these dips like 28, 29, 30 bucks."
"14753770","14755790"," Now it's ripping like a monster right now."
"14756210","14759330"," And you want to know like why is Viacom turning around?"
"14760350","14762570"," And wait a minute here. "
"14762830","14764990"," We fix this book map."
"14765730","14766890"," I'm going to exit without saving."
"14769820","14770860"," I'm going to dump. "
"14771140","14773220"," I'm going to dump book map real quick and reload it."
"14773860","14775820"," So let's talk about Viacom real quick."
"14777040","14778320"," There are some trades. "
"14779920","14782840"," Into this year that you have to be looking at right up first, right?"
"14783120","14785800"," So the Viacom trade, what makes it so special is."
"14786540","14793600"," That within this year, there's an expectation that Viacom will either be bought out or merge."
"14794200","14795780"," So let's say they merge with Roku. "
"14797040","14800940"," Roku's stock won't go up or whomever they merge with is not going their stocks."
"14802100","14803380"," Viacom's not buying anybody."
"14803980","14805020"," Viacom's getting bought. "
"14806520","14811980"," So if you know Viacom's being bought this year, they have the they had just on the 20th of"
"14811980","14812240"," December."
"14812420","14816520"," We've been talking about Viacom on Twitter and on video for weeks now."
"14817660","14822560"," And that is they had six month calls for like 30, 35 bucks for like six cents. "
"14823060","14825900"," And then you could just add those 10 cent calls every month."
"14826400","14829040"," You just keep adding them and it doesn't matter if they burn."
"14829180","14834100"," If you're buying 10 cents, six cents, 10 cent calls on some outside the money trade on Viacom, then"
"14834100","14838320"," you know, you know that eventually at some point this year, you're going to make millions. "
"14838740","14840660"," You could literally make millions off that trade."
"14841340","14845060"," And of course, you see it pumping since since end of December, right?"
"14845320","14847860"," You can call it tax loss harvesting call wherever you want to call it."
"14847860","14853280"," But in reality, there is a play to be made in Viacom this year of them getting bought out. "
"14853460","14857460"," And when they do announce that they're getting bought out, you're going to see Viacom trade to 70"
"14857460","14858120"," to 100 bucks."
"14858720","14861500"," So when you trade down to 28 bucks, there's no interest in calls."
"14862140","14863260"," There's no premium in calls. "
"14864080","14865260"," You become greedy, right?"
"14865500","14871710"," You start to say to yourself, how many times they to trade this so that it hits big time this"
"14871710","14871950"," year."
"14871950","14878850"," And you know that you guys in the back story on this is that traditional media is collapsing."
"14879350","14887830"," So if you look at like your regular TV stations and BC ABC CBS sitting down at like the 1960s. "
"14888630","14890630"," You have a TV dinner and a tray or whatever."
"14891530","14893670"," I don't want to load a previously open workspace."
"14893770","14895570"," Let's see if we can reload this from scratch. "
"14895570","14902290"," So if you remember that generation they remember the 1980s, they have all the sitcoms people would"
"14902290","14905070"," sit around after they get their homework done or whatever and watch TV shows."
"14906430","14911430"," And you had some of that still nice but all that is dying now and you've got all these companies"
"14911430","14915570"," with this this blasted into the early 2000s."
"14915570","14921330"," You have all these companies with all this content that you see Netflix now growing right you see"
"14921330","14924730"," Netflix like they have stranger things but they don't have a lot of original content. "
"14925250","14929370"," You've got these companies that are slowly dying and rolling over."
"14929830","14932490"," You see the Olympics is kind of slowly dying and rolling over."
"14932490","14940090"," And so what you're doing is you're saying to yourself, well this content is worth some money. "
"14940850","14942290"," Let's try this not available yet."
"14942630","14942830"," What do you mean?"
"14943550","14944530"," Money based settings."
"14945810","14950790"," So what you're what you're trying to do is trying to say to yourself, well what's that content is"
"14950790","14951050"," valuable. "
"14951810","14956170"," You know that wherever they merge with, they want the price of the stock to be low, which 28 bucks"
"14956170","14956590"," is low."
"14957070","14957850"," You can get as low as 10."
"14958330","14959970"," Let's let's say it comes back down to 20. "
"14960050","14960990"," You're going to buy it again or 10."
"14961090","14961630"," You're going to buy it again."
"14962130","14965710"," You're going to buy it all year long all these cheap outside the money options expiring three"
"14965710","14968030"," months out a month out whatever you choose. "
"14969330","14973930"," And what you're going to end up doing is you'll eventually hit because someone's going to commit"
"14973930","14974890"," and merge with this company."
"14975390","14979110"," Someone's going to buy this content and you look at the rise of Roku."
"14979870","14985650"," Roku wasn't looking like one of those companies but it does make sense that a company like Roku"
"14985650","14987430"," would do well by buying the content. "
"14987430","14992610"," A Viacom or one of those one of those streaming services would do well by buying it whether it's"
"14992610","14998510"," Netflix, Roku, whether it's Amazon, Apple or even Disney Disney like wants to create the wrong"
"14998510","15000850"," content but it wouldn't shock me if they."
"15002570","15012500"," If they added the content for"
"15012500","15013120"," a Viacom."
"15015140","15019720"," Hold on a second and you can update all those shows you all those shows you're like God no one's"
"15019720","15024460"," going to watch those shows but in reality, you can you can reload those shows right. "
"15024960","15026880"," It's like when you see like Star Trek being done."
"15027660","15028540"," Oh shoot."
"15029400","15030180"," Hold on here. "
"15031140","15031700"," Dang it."
"15034660","15038380"," Got this hero indicator and much just cost a month like 80 bucks a month."
"15040620","15042120"," This hero indicator is no joke. "
"15048270","15050370"," See if we can get this hero indicator pumping here for a minute."
"15051710","15055090"," All these little fees costs stuff adds up."
"15056710","15058970"," Where's my settings configure add-ons. "
"15059590","15059930"," Yes."
"15061350","15062130"," Play it baby."
"15062730","15063190"," Play a hero. "
"15065630","15068990"," So here so Viacom is one of those companies same thing goes for hood."
"15069730","15073850"," You guys something like I'm being greedy saying I want to put it 15 bucks but in reality how low"
"15073850","15074430"," is it going to trade."
"15075110","15079170"," How long is it's going to take it's going to take no more than a year forget the wallet for"
"15079170","15079570"," Robinhood. "
"15079570","15083190"," All it's going to take for Robinhood to make that stock $100 stock."
"15083930","15088590"," Is that they introduced some sort of charting software like Webull has doesn't be perfect."
"15088770","15092190"," Just some kind of basic charting software more than they have right now. "
"15092390","15095830"," If they had a replaced Vlad the stock would go to 200 bucks wouldn't it."
"15096370","15102310"," Like stomach if they if they replaced Vlad if they read if they reinvented their trading platform."
"15102990","15105130"," That platform that that stock would go to the moon. "
"15105450","15106190"," You guys know it."
"15106250","15106610"," I know it."
"15106610","15109310"," So what do you do you find it down at 15 bucks or 10 bucks. "
"15109610","15114650"," You buy dirt cheap calls on it outside the money do it one to three months out and you just"
"15114650","15117630"," reload them and you reload them and you reload them until it happens."
"15119570","15123830"," You already see it happen in Viacom you're going to see it happen on hood as well."
"15124610","15126110"," And then you'll hear people say oh no though. "
"15126470","15129710"," Maybe hood will be bought out Robinhood will be absorbed by a bank."
"15130470","15134890"," Well guess which stock goes up not the bank stock but Robinhood stock would be the one that go up."
"15136150","15138010"," Robinhood is not doing the buying of the bank. "
"15138370","15139830"," The bank's buying Robinhood."
"15140510","15141430"," So look for companies."
"15141890","15148950"," You guys want to be thinking about mergers right mergers as we as we roll into as we roll into"
"15148950","15154930"," 2000 or 2022 2023 2024 you know the market's going to trade sideways at some point. "
"15155030","15157390"," You know that we're going to have a temper tantrum at some point."
"15157570","15161750"," You know that it might not be 2022 but you know the next one to three years."
"15162390","15163950"," We're going to have some kind of a recession. "
"15163950","15166610"," You know that at some point inflation is going to matter."
"15167350","15171470"," And when this stuff does actually take place and you see some of these great companies of great"
"15171470","15171890"," concepts."
"15173330","15176410"," But they're not cash rich or they're trading at all time lows. "
"15176870","15180010"," They're going to get rolled into other companies they're going to get bought by other companies."
"15181730","15183390"," So even though you hear people out there saying."
"15185300","15189620"," I don't know pay pals never come back squares never come back pins has never come back. "
"15191060","15192840"," What's whatever you call it right."
"15194140","15196220"," Maybe P times not coming back that's possible."
"15196660","15200180"," I don't see P time ever come back or being absorbed by another company. "
"15200360","15201600"," That's that's a publicly traded company."
"15201860","15203320"," But you're looking like a Robinhood."
"15203560","15207380"," You're going to try to tell me that they're not going to fire to flat at some point or that"
"15207380","15209840"," they're not going to launch a better trading platform. "
"15210340","15213700"," If they don't do that that they're not going to try to revamp their image."
"15214160","15217680"," Or they're not going to fire Vlad and bring some other CEO in to lend some credibility to that"
"15217680","15218080"," stock."

"15391830","15392730"," Wait a minute here. "
"15393190","15393750"," What's going on here."
"15394230","15400210"," I was trying to put a video out on Sunday so that you guys had a basket of stocks to"
"15400210","15401210"," start tracking for the year."
"15401870","15402990"," But Viacom is on that list. "
"15404750","15405890"," Roblox is on that list."
"15407990","15409990"," A firm is on that list at a certain price."
"15411150","15415210"," Square PayPal the usual suspects all the beaten down stocks are on that list. "
"15416750","15422510"," Our case on that list my real bottom on our case sixty dollars seventy five is where I want to"
"15422510","15422930"," buy it."

"15427010","15428190"," buy it until March."
"15429270","15431490"," February March I've got a whole video for you guys. "
"15431970","15436770"," I did a short video on Monday at the open pre pre market I talked about it briefly."
"15437670","15444480"," About my expectations for the year and they seem pretty rational if we're ahead of this year."
"15446320","15448060"," Same at least they sounded same. "
"15449860","15454820"," So again I'm still waiting for capitulation do I get capitulation to the close at four seventy"
"15454820","15455220"," four."
"15456260","15456740"," Maybe."
"15457680","15462980"," Maybe I get capitulation right into the F and Bell and I get my four seventy four so I can"
"15462980","15463260"," buy. "
"15477150","15482100"," Yeah there's a lot of air flows flowing to airlines."
"15487040","15491980"," Yeah so bill was very was very was was very strong right that."
"15492320","15497320"," I want to look at bill again because I haven't looked at it recently but it wasn't a really nice"
"15497320","15498080"," bullish track. "
"15500500","15504380"," And it was we traded we traded bill all summer long."
"15504840","15509160"," So I do have a concern here so let's look you guys on your own charts look at bull or"
"15509160","15510080"," bill excuse me."
"15510860","15512480"," So you look at bill right here right. "
"15514040","15516160"," And what does bill remind you of."
"15517320","15518020"," Anybody know."
"15519380","15523340"," Reminds me of what was the trade of it was one of the trades that we put on all last"
"15523340","15523580"," year. "
"15524120","15526240"," We traded bill all last year on Twitter."
"15526240","15531920"," And what does bill look like right now looks like as cute doesn't it in January 2021."
"15532640","15535480"," Kind of looks like PayPal kind of looks like. "
"15536140","15540580"," Twenty twenty remember and remember in twenty twenty and in the new year."
"15540860","15542120"," It all these new stories."
"15543040","15546900"," There's lots of life left in our case is lots of the trade of twenty twenty one. "
"15547220","15549060"," Is arc G arc F."
"15549780","15549920"," Right."
"15551060","15558040"," So it looks like is bill a bad stock no it just looks like banks are taking profit on a"
"15558040","15561360"," trade that should that started in April of twenty twenty."
"15562120","15567080"," So where does bill trade down to probably eight nine dollars bad to guess. "
"15569130","15573970"," Down another hundred bucks probably trade down even if it even if it comes up probably going to"
"15573970","15575150"," trade down for a year."
"15575770","15576730"," If not nine months."
"15578290","15582310"," So we didn't want to know what these trades are for this year right. "
"15582570","15585810"," What is the bill trade for twenty twenty two."
"15588260","15590560"," And I've got some I've got some conditions for it."
"15590700","15592260"," If you guys want to know what the bill trade is. "
"15592740","15597860"," So my conditions for the bill trade is that the IPO within three years."
"15599240","15603180"," That they've had year over year profits of thirty percent or greater."
"15605350","15610950"," That they've had I think it's nine consecutive six or nine consecutive. "
"15612010","15613130"," Positive ERs."
"15613510","15615750"," It's like every year's had great for guidance."
"15616230","15618270"," Great ERs like they're just good companies. "
"15618810","15622810"," And then they're on this upward move that bill took for a year and a half."
"15623330","15626930"," And so we can identify those stocks for twenty twenty two."
"15627150","15629010"," We should have a pretty fat basket of stocks. "
"15639460","15641500"," Yeah four seventy five is just as good."
"15641800","15643560"," Sometimes these buyers will sneak up."
"15643880","15649180"," You know if the buyers sneak up from four seventy four and grab four seventy five. "
"15649580","15650140"," I'm a buyer."
"15650380","15653220"," I'll probably want to put on a spread of some kind."
"15654220","15655020"," Maybe in the money spread. "
"15657710","15662570"," Maybe it expires like Wednesday of next week."
"15665260","15667060"," Here was negative fifty six thousand."
"15667320","15668700"," Yeah, I'm hoping that we sell off into the clothes. "
"15669380","15669920"," That's my hope."
"15672460","15673520"," Is it a good short?"
"15673520","15674380"," Hello."
"15674520","15674860"," In Vasquez. "
"15675120","15675900"," In Vasquez in there."
"15677020","15678460"," I didn't know in Vasquez in there."
"15678680","15679480"," Is it Vasquez in here?"
"15680740","15681500"," Love that man. "
"15682300","15682940"," Hey Jafar."
"15683100","15683480"," How are you?"
"15684760","15686780"," Captain, you use margin and if not why?"
"15687080","15687860"," Good question Jafar."
"15688380","15688720"," Okay. "
"15689120","15691960"," So the first time I made money, I made a bunch of money."
"15694270","15696090"," First time I made money, I made a bunch of money."
"15696450","15702730"," I spent high six figures and I was offered margin. "
"15702730","15708010"," So I took margin and then I realized that I can only buy stock with margin."
"15708670","15709670"," I was like, wait a minute."
"15709690","15710890"," I can't trade options with margin. "
"15710890","15712470"," You guys are going to let me get that risky with it."
"15715040","15717620"," So I didn't like that concept of trading a margin."
"15717760","15720100"," I didn't like the idea of concept of trading stock on margin. "
"15721020","15725020"," But my second problem with margin was that it wasn't a real number to me."
"15727150","15732790"," And then my last problem with margin is that I've seen traders get margin called."
"15732790","15735210"," Like friends of mine get margin calls. "
"15737770","15739090"," Hey, Vasquez, good to see you."
"15742880","15747140"," I've seen traders get margin called and it's not pretty."
"15749160","15750340"," It's not a pretty site. "
"15751840","15756520"," The, you know, you know, getting margin calls is like, I try to relate it like this."
"15756840","15759760"," You ever get into a trade, especially an options trade."
"15760980","15766080"," And the mechanics of that trade when you, let's say, let's see you buy a 100 call and the price"
"15766080","15766920"," is at $100. "
"15768360","15770460"," And then we go down to like 90."
"15771420","15774120"," And then it trades back up to $100."
"15775240","15778560"," And your call is now still down 30%. "
"15779200","15781580"," You're like, why it should be even at least here, right?"
"15782220","15783660"," Well, no, because some time has passed."
"15783980","15787460"," And now you need it to go not to the 110 you were hoping was going to."
"15787600","15790900"," But now it needs to go like 105 to break even, right?"
"15791720","15793120"," Maybe even 110 to break even. "
"15794780","15800360"," So you want to turn to the thumb of a margin call or under the thumb of losing money on"
"15800360","15800640"," margin."
"15801220","15802900"," You never really recover from it."
"15803240","15805360"," And then you're stuck in that trade, right?"
"15805560","15806280"," You're stuck in a trade. "
"15806920","15808500"," It's so, I don't, I can't stand margin."
"15809300","15810120"," So just use cash."
"15810920","15812960"," That's all I do. "
"15813240","15815160"," Use cash, cash, cash, cash all day long."
"15816000","15816580"," Trade a cash account."
"15819500","15820660"," You guys want to know a secret?"
"15821440","15822560"," I got a secret for it. "
"15822620","15823280"," Some of you guys know this."
"15824140","15824820"," Hi, investment."
"15825400","15826320"," Vesca, what are you trading?"
"15828600","15832440"," Ooh, investment was looking for 474 on the spy end of day. "
"15833620","15835220"," So sell puts and buy new calls."
"15836080","15838340"," That's what we've been talking about investment all day around here."
"15838560","15839280"," Give me 474. "
"15841260","15842440"," Just so you can see investment."
"15842820","15847500"," There's a nice little buy area for smart money at 47428."
"15848100","15851380"," There's a little bit creeping above here at 47527. "
"15852180","15853360"," But that's what we're looking for."
"15853460","15855460"," Sell off into the close to go long."
"15857360","15860120"," We're on the same page as you in Vesca. "
"15863930","15866730"," Yeah, I have, I have shared my, my trading view charts."
"15876840","15878020"," Yeah, so exactly."
"15878540","15880980"," So that's the thing about margin margin is. "
"15882220","15883940"," If all you've got is margin, that's fine."
"15884080","15885180"," I understand that that's all you have."
"15885500","15887380"," It's hard to trademark for me. "
"15887580","15888700"," It's risky to trade margin."
"15889780","15892160"," I don't like trading money that's not mine."
"15892160","15896260"," And what I'll give you a secret, though, any new traders out there. "
"15896880","15901020"," When you do have an account that you got, I got a secret for you."
"15901980","15904960"," So let's say you have an account that's, is it $25,000?"
"15905440","15909360"," I think is the, is where your day trading restrictions come off."
"15909700","15910460"," I think it's 25 grand. "
"15911200","15912240"," It's a 25 grand."
"15915830","15918570"," So let's say you have a sub $25,000 account."
"15919450","15921950"," And you're hindered by day trading restrictions. "
"15923510","15929710"," And you get, they would send you some, I think some broker just send you a, some broker just send"
"15929710","15934230"," you a warning letter or you can request to a trade again or something like that."
"15936890","15942750"," If you go and open a tasty trade account, I think you can make multiple accounts with them."
"15943230","15945610"," I think you can make like 10 accounts. "
"15947490","15949270"," 10, 12 accounts with tasty trade."
"15949970","15953230"," You can just open, you open a brokerage with taste trade and you open like 10 accounts."
"15954450","15960330"," And if you get, if you get nailed with a, with a, with a, with a, where I forget they're"
"15960330","15961010"," called now. "
"15962430","15966850"," Day trade, break a day trader rule, you can move your money from what account to the other end"
"15966850","15967510"," tasty trade."
"15968830","15970470"," What that does for you as a trader."
"15971190","15976910"," So when you're only limited to so many trades a day, it's, it's meant to screw you over as a"
"15976910","15977210"," new trader. "
"15977730","15980830"," And reality, you don't want any stress of not making too many trades."
"15980870","15982130"," That whole concept is wrong."
"15982530","15985010"," If you're in a bad trade, you should get out of it every single time. "
"15985530","15988050"," Get out of bad trades every single time."
"15990980","15992200"," Yeah, it's 25,000."
"15992640","15993000"," Okay. "
"15993220","15994720"," So if you're in a bad trade, right?"
"15994980","15999720"," The, the, the, the, the gods of the SEC and they say, well, we want you to make sure that"
"15999720","16000580"," you plan your trade trade."
"16001160","16004120"," You, you planning out your trade and then you make a winning trade."
"16004520","16006360"," If you're a new trader, you're going to make tons of bad trades. "
"16006800","16012220"," So let's say you make a bad trade and you stay in it because, because you're afraid of breaking day"
"16012220","16012800"," trader rules."
"16013140","16013380"," That's insane."
"16014160","16018380"," You should break those day trader rules, get out of your bad trade and reposition for a better"
"16018380","16018680"," trade. "
"16019180","16023400"," So let's say you break your day trader rules and you get banned from, let's say, Robin Hood or some"
"16023400","16024000"," shit like that."
"16024500","16027300"," You should sign up for like any of the big brokerages like, like tasty."
"16028060","16029520"," I'm sure there's others, others that do it. "
"16029900","16030980"," You can make multiple accounts."
"16031400","16033800"," You can make like 5, 10, 11, 20 accounts."
"16034260","16036280"," You can wire money between accounts. "
"16036940","16038300"," Let's say you get busted out of a trade."
"16038420","16039760"," You want to start trading next day."
"16039860","16042940"," Just wire early cash to the next, to the next taste trade accounts. "
"16043260","16045640"," It costs like 25 bucks, 50 bucks, something like that."
"16049740","16050560"," No, no, no, no."
"16050960","16054860"," They only do that on those shit, on those shitty brokerages that you new traders use. "
"16055460","16056860"," You guys go to a real brokerage."
"16057360","16058980"," You can, you can make money, many, many accounts."
"16065350","16066410"," Now, good faith violation. "
"16066710","16066750"," Yeah."
"16066870","16068090"," You want to get around good faith violations?"
"16069770","16071130"," Not financial advice."
"16071870","16072830"," Go to tasty trade. "
"16076480","16077840"," Not financial advice."
"16078220","16081400"," You can go to tasty trade and you won't encounter any of that there."
"16089830","16092310"," That's an old, that's an old school Wall Street bet thing. "
"16092590","16094450"," I learned that on Wall Street bets like 10 years ago."
"16100000","16100760"," Yeah, exactly."
"16101040","16104800"," Have a margin accounts so you can make multiple trades, but don't have any marginal balance. "
"16112160","16112600"," Yeah."
"16112760","16114080"," So cash is the only problem."
"16114400","16115680"," That is because you had a weighted day. "
"16115680","16121080"," Well, we don't have all day."
"16121180","16121420"," Hurry up."
"16121500","16121700"," Okay. "
"16121760","16124800"," So I'm getting yelled at by my, by my kids."
"16125720","16127440"," My oldest daughter just texted me."
"16127920","16129360"," We don't have all day. "
"16129780","16130160"," Hurry up."
"16132410","16133510"," You guys come downstairs."
"16134070","16135710"," You guys, do you guys want to come?"
"16136050","16137010"," Hold on one second guys. "
"16139700","16141800"," I got them locked up in their classroom right now."
"16150580","16880890"," Can you"
"16880890","16881430"," guys hear me now?"
"16882110","16882470"," Check."
"16882870","16883510"," Check 123. "
"16884410","16885090"," You guys hear me?"
"16885130","16886370"," I've been talking for like 10 minutes."
"16887850","16889030"," You guys have me right now."
"16891970","16893510"," Check one, two, three, four. "
"16893830","16894530"," You guys hear me?"
"16920440","16920880"," Okay."
"16921480","16922420"," So now you can hear me."
"16922740","16922920"," Okay. "
"16923560","16924620"," I had two different mutes on."
"16926280","16927340"," First, we're going to talk."
"16927520","16928660"," We're going to talk about. "
"16929380","16932120"," We're going to talk to talk to investment first."
"16932360","16932520"," Okay."
"16933660","16934340"," So. "
"16935800","16937820"," Here it is on Tesla."
"16938580","16940120"," If you look on a candlestick chart."
"16940720","16944740"," There was a nice bull flag that formed last week of December. "
"16946600","16947600"," On Friday."
"16948540","16950520"," We came to we traded up, right?"
"16951260","16953940"," So Friday into Monday, we traded up on Tesla."
"16955400","16956400"," We to 1200. "
"16956860","16959480"," We tested 1250 support."
"16960980","16966260"," Broke through and Tesla's trying to reclaim or establish that this is main support."
"16966840","16971380"," But the banks are sitting down at 11 11 11 10. "
"16971840","16976760"," Now the banks are sitting down there because that is the top of the bull flag from last week."
"16978060","16980460"," We all know how Tesla trade Tesla trades."
"16981120","16985920"," It's positive that we're that we're trading around that 1150 1140 right now and Tesla button"
"16985920","16986280"," reality. "
"16987120","16989660"," It's good for a retest of the top of that bull flag."
"16990180","16995200"," To take it from 11 11 11 11 back up to the 1200 mark."
"16995700","16997460"," I'll bring that chart back up here in just a moment. "
"17002830","17009070"," Yeah, you know, it's not the I agree with that with the ES 5% drawdowns of a really condition."
"17009730","17012170"," Condition dip buyers, but I back tested."
"17012670","17014730"," I back tested all the way back to 2007. "
"17015110","17017290"," I'm going to release that video for you this week."
"17017290","17025250"," And this year, even if it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if we correct 20% in February or March."
"17026130","17031870"," It doesn't matter if we correct 5%, 10%, 20%, 15%, 30%. "
"17031870","17033950"," Doesn't matter if we correct like we did in 2020."
"17035650","17039170"," About how last year played out and in all previous years."
"17039730","17041230"," Whether we go down or not. "
"17041370","17043890"," Well, we should go down at least the one point between now much."
"17044010","17048510"," No matter where we go to, no matter where that drawdown is, there is a dip to buy there."
"17049750","17054890"," Unless you're talking about a crash that's worse than 2007 or 1938. "
"17055390","17056970"," Every time I crash like that."
"17057830","17059430"," Then I don't know what to say to you."
"17059670","17060930"," No one can really predict that. "
"17063390","17065810"," That crash hasn't happened since 1929."
"17065810","17066170"," Right."
"17066570","17066710"," So. "
"17068070","17071330"," You can't really predict that crash, but a crash like March, 2020."
"17071730","17079230"," Going back to 2007, even looked into the 80s into 1987, 86, 87, we had a, we had a crash,"
"17079490","17081750"," a minor major correction."
"17083430","17084950"," Minor crash, major correction. "
"17085870","17089010"," And 86, but I back tested where we should be this year."
"17089550","17092130"," And there should be a low points in February or March."
"17092130","17095350"," It doesn't matter where that low point is. "
"17095850","17099550"," Because as soon as it turns, you should be long in stock."
"17100930","17102350"," For the year at that point."
"17107320","17108180"," Yeah, and that's good. "
"17108520","17110060"," I'll show it to you again one more time."
"17110800","17114420"," So we are, there is, there were some dip fires down here for 74, 77."
"17114820","17115640"," We get that low and spy. "
"17115960","17116500"," I should have bought that."
"17118680","17120940"," Look at the chart candlestick over here."
"17127880","17129660"," So on the, yeah, on Tesla. "
"17130040","17132380"," I'll bring that chart back, the Tesla chart back up again."
"17133820","17135720"," That sees spies not done puking."
"17136440","17137200"," Not my view. "
"17137360","17137680"," It isn't."
"17139260","17140040"," Spies not done."
"17140300","17141060"," Spies coming down here. "
"17141180","17141920"," Why you guys to see this?"
"17142100","17142220"," Okay."
"17143220","17144940"," Spies coming down to 474 32."
"17145940","17146960"," Or close to it. "
"17148620","17150060"," We'll watch it into the close here."
"17151960","17154540"," It should be a deep, a pretty decent dip by."
"17156880","17159560"," You don't want to be breaking through 4750. "
"17160220","17164760"," For long, if we go down to like 47 or 47 for somewhere, that's a gift."
"17166200","17168060"," If we start breaking through 4,700."
"17170040","17171180"," We got some problems. "
"17172280","17175600"," But 47 five is pretty much bottom 474."
"17176080","17180740"," Well, at least the book map is showing it at 47 4.35. Hopefully get some weakness into the close."
"17184510","17186450"," Yeah, the dip by, you know, Tesla trades. "
"17186650","17187290"," Tesla's going to go down."
"17187470","17188910"," We're not going down, but it's going to trade sideways and down."
"17189290","17190290"," Typically, not always. "
"17190810","17192350"," For two, three days, maybe five."
"17193310","17194170"," Then a repair once again."
"17199480","17201820"," If Tesla holds 1150. "
"17202400","17206300"," And just trade sideways for three to five days, that wouldn't be shocking to anybody out there."
"17206380","17208220"," The trades Tesla or invest in Tesla."
"17208700","17210440"," It's not abnormal for Tesla to do this. "
"17212100","17213140"," Nothing out of the norm."
"17214940","17220860"," You know, you stay at 1150 and then you have people that are in calls that bought the FOMO at"
"17220860","17221400"," 1200."
"17223600","17224980"," 1217, wherever it was. "
"17225500","17227040"," And now they're not going to gather calls."
"17227320","17228880"," All those calls expire worthless on Friday."
"17229860","17230880"," And then Monday is a new week, right?"
"17232580","17232900"," For Tesla. "
"17235560","17236320"," Marketmakers clean up."
"17236960","17237660"," Thank you for playing."
"17238840","17240360"," I don't know how that goes. "
"17252800","17254000"," Let's look at spy again."
"17255140","17257900"," I get the spine out of like 474, please."
"17258680","17259780"," Please give me 474. "
"17261100","17262280"," That might have been the dip by."
"17262620","17263540"," What do you guys think you got?"
"17263680","17266920"," You guys think this was the dip by and spy right now into the close?"
"17272830","17274070"," You guys think this is the by?"
"17278280","17280060"," No, I agree with, I agree with you, Chris."
"17280880","17283500"," Like I agree with you 100% that you could we have conditioned. "
"17284960","17287780"," Traders to buy the dip at 5%."
"17287780","17288860"," 100% we have."
"17289960","17292100"," We have more retail in the market than ever before. "
"17292280","17295100"," And one day, one of these days, just like March, 2020, they're going to get burned, right?"
"17296120","17298320"," February, March, 2020, they got burned."
"17301490","17306510"," But the point is that whatever drawdown that is we have this year, no matter where that drawdown"
"17306510","17308430"," is, there is going to be a dip."
"17308570","17312070"," Well, history says there will be a dip buy in there. "
"17312650","17313950"," Unless it's 1938."
"17313950","17320110"," And that means that includes us trading down on the year."
"17320810","17323670"," And if we trade sideways on the year, so if we trade down on the year. "
"17324110","17328390"," If we trade sideways on the year, if we trade with a slight profit on the year."
"17328990","17334050"," We're still going to have that moment that we trade down in February, March, historically speaking,"
"17334550","17335870"," unless it was."
"17336490","17337410"," Unless it was. "
"17339550","17346780"," 1929 or something like that."
"17346780","17348320"," I think that's the only one that's going to be the last 20 years in the 50s and 60s."
"17348940","17353920"," That weren't different, but I went, I back tested as far as far as I possibly could to get a"
"17353920","17355900"," pretty decent answer for the last 20 years. "
"17362100","17363520"," Yeah, and it will be carnage."
"17364100","17365740"," So, but what, what that's the question, right?"
"17365880","17366980"," What's everybody's question out there."
"17367140","17371600"," Everybody's question is, where can I buy stocks for 2022?"
"17372440","17376600"," And my point is that because of the year we had last year. "
"17377320","17383040"," there's a fair chance that between now and March you're going to see a dip that you can buy."
"17385460","17394760"," So in terms of how much risk you're putting on for when you're buying stocks this year, I'm"
"17394760","17398900"," probably going to make my basket and wait for that moment in February and March."
"17399220","17403760"," Now if I missed that moment in February and March, I'll reassess for the next quarter and say,"
"17403840","17405220"," okay, maybe I need to start buying now. "
"17405900","17406480"," Maybe we're safe."
"17416510","17423550"," But I think as a bull, I'm not ready to buy stock until February and March."
"17425930","17427970"," It can happen in January, but it's going to happen. "
"17431700","17436840"," I put it at like a 75% chance that there's going to be a dip that takes us back"
"17436840","17439500"," to 4.56, 4.50, that minimum."
"17440840","17443300"," That minimum, if not down to, you know, 400."
"17445040","17447660"," Anywhere between 450 and 400, you'll see a dip. "
"17453830","17459440"," Come on, give me 4.74. Are you guys going to buy this dip for the clothes right here or"
"17459440","17459600"," no?"
"17460320","17460780"," I'm waiting."
"17466070","17473910"," No, I have a video that I need to make for you guys that I can take you back every"
"17473910","17476270"," year and show you cyclically."
"17476810","17479970"," It depends on how it depends on how we close the year. "
"17485710","17491970"," For like the last 20 years, if we closed the year down in September to December, let's see, we"
"17491970","17494070"," traded down all September into December."
"17495150","17498430"," We like sold down into the clothes of the 31st."
"17500490","17502030"," We tend not to have that dip. "
"17503990","17511210"," But if we traded upper sideways, leading into the end of the year prior, even if we had a sideways"
"17511210","17517530"," or negative year, we tend to have a nice dip, not 10."
"17517730","17519810"," We do like 95% of the time."
"17520450","17529950"," We have a dip in January and March, and that dip usually corresponds with the low from the previous"
"17529950","17530210"," year. "
"17531090","17536210"," Last year, I think it was at 4.48, 4.45, something like that at the end of the year."
"17536650","17537310"," We should be down there."
"17537430","17538270"," We should be down like that 450. "
"17538890","17545770"," It's possibly go deeper, which is what Chris was talking about when we go deeper than that 5%."
"17545770","17552950"," But either way, even if we, let's say we dip down 20% or 30%, there's still a dip to"
"17552950","17553170"," buy."
"17553610","17556870"," There was still a dip to buy in March 2020 when we had COVID, right?"
"17557550","17558730"," There was still a dip to buy. "
"17558890","17560070"," There was still a turn in the market."
"17560550","17563890"," You have to be able to identify that turn in the market so that you can buy that bottom."
"17571110","17573750"," So we have, it's two o'clock right now. "
"17573790","17574930"," We have more salaries than buyers."
"17575250","17578590"," We have five to four on buyers, excuse me, sellers."
"17579590","17583930"," And we also have a negative hero indicator into the clothes on the spot. "
"17588000","17588840"," Yeah, keep waiting."
"17590480","17591280"," I'm waiting to."
"17596000","17598980"," So yeah, I'll talk about, I'll talk, I'm going to make a video for you guys. "
"17599140","17600320"," I need to make a video for you guys."
"17600580","17605600"," The moment I have some time, I need to make a video where I show you guys year by year"
"17605600","17608240"," going back to the crash in 2006."
"17608480","17617260"," And it's interesting because I don't see many people talk about this, but you can really see where"
"17617260","17618340"," those lows are every year. "
"17618600","17619800"," You can see them in the springtime."
"17620020","17620720"," You can see them in the summer."
"17621340","17623980"," Sometimes again, June and July will always have them in the springtime. "
"17624640","17627820"," There's always that moment we trade down to our previous low and retest it."
"17628680","17632880"," It doesn't matter though, if we trade through it, as long as you know it's coming, or there's a"
"17632880","17637380"," high chance of it coming, you can now plan on what you're going to buy at that time for the"
"17637380","17638000"," rest of the year."
"17640300","17641680"," There's some other things you want to be looking for. "
"17641760","17643600"," You want to be looking, investment knows this too."
"17644180","17650300"," You're looking for stocks that are participating in rallies, not participating in rallies."
"17650760","17655080"," You want to be checking out stocks that are not, are at bottoms that are not participating in the"
"17655080","17656300"," market going down any further. "
"17656960","17658160"," Sometimes you'll see the market fall."
"17658720","17660860"," The stock that's at bottom won't fall anymore."
"17662120","17663660"," So you know that's the bottom for that stock. "
"17666170","17669450"," VIX is at 17.10. Outstanding."
"17672890","17674010"," I like when VIX climbs."
"17682960","17708770"," It's at 17.40. I'll"
"17708770","17714240"," put double bottom on. "
"17714580","17716180"," That's a nice double bottom on the VIX."
"17724850","17735230"," One, two, three, two, three, third."
"17743780","17744780"," VIX is getting juicy. "
"17763630","17766930"," So we have a buy program beginning on the spy right now."
"17768530","17769450"," Just a heads up."
"17781650","17784130"," So you guys can see there is a buy program on the spy right now. "
"17787080","17839660"," It just started, started at 2.10. Does"
"17839660","17840840"," that not mean 4.34?"
"17841220","17848940"," I wouldn't shock me to see us trade up to 3 p.m. It wouldn't shock me to see us"
"17848940","17849580"," trade up."
"17867870","17910070"," 477, 474, January"
"17910070","17911470"," 5th."
"17934800","17936300"," Buyer is still stepping in. "
"17936460","17939720"," They're not stepping in on the January 5th calls anymore at 480c."
"17941760","17948160"," But we have increased in 480c's for Friday for 480."
"17948660","17950240"," There's now 50,000 calls. "
"17951260","17954420"," Let's look at next week's puts to see if people are loading up on those."
"17955000","17958600"," We do have some pretty decent put action on Friday as well."
"17965460","17970420"," More calls stepping in on Monday and Wednesday. "
"17970880","17973680"," Oh, it looks like on the 10th we've got some puts."
"17976300","17980600"," Still have some 480 next Wednesday."
"17982120","17983560"," We look at this little chart and see. "
"18011900","18014520"," You guys didn't catch the buy program."
"18015640","18017080"," Yeah, that was a good dip to buy."

"18109750","18113690"," So the 474 buyers are the ones that are in here right now."
"18115370","18116370"," Mr. Heads up."
"18174680","18181800"," What are Friday's calls centered around 7th?"
"18184150","18185190"," There's lots of flow. "
"18185390","18185650"," It's weird."
"18185810","18189110"," You've got lots of flow in the spy probably due to XLE."
"18189790","18192030"," XLF is going to hold the spy up. "
"18192370","18196330"," There is some significance put structure coming in for the cues."
"18197650","18199070"," Just the heads up on that."
"18210080","18219770"," Spies being lots of puts"
"18219770","18222310"," coming in even though the cues look like they're at a bottom right now. "
"18222430","18223290"," Keep your eye on the cues."
"18224110","18238500"," There could be a bull trap in here somewhere or even"
"18238500","18240200"," just the trading sideways and to close."
"18240620","18242640"," I'm still looking for that 474 as well. "
"18243960","18245640"," I still want that 474 buy."
"18246660","18248060"," I don't want to buy here in the middle."
"18248460","18250260"," That's kind of no man kind of no man's land. "
"18253360","18255620"," There are some sky puts coming in."
"18255620","18257240"," S-K-Y-Y."
"18257460","18258720"," I haven't checked the chart on it yet. "
"18259540","18260400"," You might have already dumped."
"18269570","18275050"," Y'all remember how into into the first of the year they were telling everybody to buy cloud"
"18275050","18280090"," computing and sure enough cloud computing is just utterly shit the bed."
"18280890","18290190"," It might as me have RK last last last December but but sky right now is at 99 bucks. "
"18290930","18295950"," It's the second touch possibly a double bottom on sky computing."
"18295950","18297170"," S-K-Y-Y."
"18297690","18301330"," Maybe it might be a worth a look at it but it doesn't look like it's done correcting. "
"18301690","18302930"," It looks like it can go lower."
"18308860","18318540"," That trade started way way back in March of 2020 so I would say it can go down a lot"
"18318540","18318820"," more."
"18320560","18330000"," So sky computing sky cloud computing went up from March 2020 all the way to November 9th. "
"18330200","18334320"," Remember they were telling everybody this month cloud security cloud computing is going to be the"
"18334320","18335700"," trade of 2022."
"18336560","18339700"," It reminds me of them telling you RK was the trade of 2021."
"18340820","18346220"," Now they're telling you on CNBC to buy cloud security and it's about to fall off a cliff right"
"18346220","18346420"," here. "
"18348040","18354780"," It peaked out at 119 in the start of December telling you to buy this to buy cloud security and"
"18354780","18356420"," it looks like it's going to fall right off a cliff."
"18357040","18360600"," If you're a bear there's a ton of clips coming in on sky right now."
"18360740","18362140"," S-K-Y-Y is the ticker. "
"18364490","18371590"," So meanwhile you've got CNBC pumping you went to buy in 2022 and yet it's just selling off cloud"
"18371590","18371990"," security."
"18372610","18374490"," What's the other one is a bug or something like that."
"18375330","18381430"," I think one of them is called bug global cyber security ETF bug. "
"18383370","18385870"," That one's just falling off the side of a cliff right."
"18387010","18394910"," And meanwhile they told you buy bug and that was a trade that began in March 20th of 2020."
"18395850","18398490"," So you're like do I really buy that now after a two-year trade?"
"18399750","18400250"," No. "
"18401570","18404030"," No you don't buy bug after a two-year long."
"18407080","18413500"," You don't buy sky after a two-year long after CNBC tells you in December that the 2022 trade is"
"18413500","18414040"," cloud computing."
"18414840","18416500"," It's insane how they're selling you their bags. "
"18420660","18425260"," They told you that the trade was RK in 2021 right."
"18425960","18427320"," And then it just sold off right."
"18427440","18431540"," They told you square was the trade in 2021 paypal that was all bullshit. "
"18432720","18437200"," So then now they're telling you not to buy Kathy Woods RK."
"18438180","18442720"," Now they're telling you not to buy companies that have been beaten down for entire year."
"18442980","18447760"," And then this morning CNBC said yeah buy them. "
"18448300","18449340"," You can't buy them in."
"18449440","18450720"," You got to wait to buy them until February."
"18456420","18458760"," And you can't buy anything with the telling you to buy for 2022. "
"18459200","18461720"," You got to find your own stocks for 2022."
"18466580","18467740"," That shit pisses me off."
"18468560","18470840"," That shit gets me all riled up if they do that. "
"18471420","18474180"," That they sell these stories to retail traders."
"18480280","18482900"," Let's see if this is a rejection right here or not on the spot."
"18501010","18503910"," There's still more buyers still positive flow in the spot. "
"18512980","18514160"," Don't diddle in the middle."
"18524830","18525990"," Don't mess around in the middle."
"18526090","18527690"," There's no investment knows. "
"18527970","18529970"," There's no reason to be diddling around the middle."
"18530470","18531090"," You get burned."
"18537890","18539950"," You get a nice sweet pullback to 474. "
"18540490","18541650"," It's a nice run to 480."
"18542490","18543530"," We might miss it."
"18543750","18545770"," 475.59 is pretty steep. "
"18546770","18550750"," I just don't like heading into the clothes right now on a Tuesday."
"18552990","18555330"," I figured where do they want it for Wednesday opex."
"18560850","18564290"," If you sell it down to 474 you can ride it up to the 475. "
"18571530","18572490"," Don't mess with the middle."
"18574960","18577220"," Lots of TSM calls coming in right now."
"18577480","18579220"," Lots of spy calls coming in right now. "
"18580780","18582760"," AFRM with more puts."
"18583660","18584960"," Come on AFRM."
"18586120","18591920"," I hope I wonder if that AFRM fly or condor is going to print nicely. "
"18597920","18600400"," I want to see if AFRM trades down to $65."
"18604140","18609120"," I wonder if you can put that condor on for 65 and 100 basically."
"18609940","18615720"," You do like a 95.99 and a 65.60 or something. "
"18617520","18618180"," Condor."
"18618640","18620920"," You could probably other than the volatility."
"18626070","18627330"," Other than the volatility. "
"18627830","18630170"," If you are looking nicely."
"18662900","18669120"," Just a word of caution too out there that XLU, if you are able to be aware that XLP is"
"18669120","18670560"," getting up there pretty high right now."
"18671840","18675540"," XLU is looking a little shortable. "
"18682880","18685940"," Made all time high as that XLU a couple of days ago in the overnight."
"18690840","18692080"," Couldn't break all"
"18692080","18703080"," time high as how"
"18703080","18706040"," semiconductors become sell the news when one of these events happened."
"18707220","18712540"," There was a dip bot on semiconductors today. "
"18719210","18722930"," But you had another failure to make an all time high at 562."
"18724430","18725350"," We are right."
"18725570","18726850"," We are right for a pullback. "
"18728310","18732990"," Listen now bearish and get the bears all fired up right now."
"18736640","18742160"," I can show Tesla."
"18755080","18756400"," I will show Tesla real quick. "
"18766480","18768640"," I skipped on my vacation in Vesqua."
"18769500","18774520"," I skipped on going to Utah this year."
"18775360","18777320"," My buddy still wants me to come out right now. "
"18778860","18787750"," So most years I would have spent in like for a month I will spend somewhere between $5,000 and"
"18787750","18793150"," $10,000 and the price for me to go skiing this year was not worth it."
"18797000","18801820"," Even last year even with inflation last year wasn't so bad this year."
"18803000","18808020"," I am getting all bearish out there for you guys. "
"18808980","18809500"," I am a bull."
"18812160","18815700"," So nothing has really changed here on Tesla."
"18816780","18822120"," There are big buyers here in Tesla right here but you guys know where the dip is right?"
"18822260","18822760"," It is $1,100. "
"18823720","18830980"," If you guys want to put more risk on to buy the dips between $1,125 and $1,150 your"
"18830980","18833700"," first resistance is $1,170 and then it is $1,200."
"18837360","18840540"," You guys want like minute by minute, Tesla is not moving right now."
"18840640","18844020"," If you guys want to know Tesla is trying to establish a support level. "
"18844660","18845560"," That is what is happening."
"18849320","18863740"," So let's see we will do if you wanted"
"18863740","18871800"," to buy if you are like that hard up to go long on Tesla I"
"18871800","18875000"," would say it is not today."
"18875540","18876100"," It might be. "
"18877100","18881560"," You missed yesterday or maybe you missed the 20 points yesterday."
"18881840","18883540"," I don't know or the 60 points yesterday."
"18884860","18886620"," Let's say you want to buy the clothes on Tesla. "
"18887260","18893200"," You can buy like an $1,100 and $1,142 call spread like two weeks out."
"18893740","18894140"," That probably hit."
"18894140","18894560"," Right?"
"18906940","18907840"," Yeah you quit skiing. "
"18908420","18910040"," Yeah so my knees are bad right now."
"18910420","18910680"," I ski."
"18911060","18912000"," I'm from out west. "
"18912560","18918780"," That is where I have lived most of my adult life and I still ski aggressively and I ski often"
"18919600","18925920"," but I moved to Michigan a couple of years ago and so now I just spend the winters."
"18926900","18928440"," Well more than a couple of years ago."
"18928540","18933240"," I have been here now three years I think just before COVID and I was only planning on spending a"
"18933240","18938820"," year here in Michigan but when COVID began it got ugly it was better for me to stay here. "
"18944210","18946770"," Yeah it's kicking up right now it's not this is a consult."
"18947210","18951690"," So what is happening right now just let you know is this is a consolidation phase."
"18952670","18959150"," We broke through support we had two levels of buyers right the level of buyers at 1150 and another"
"18959150","18961130"," level of buyers at 1100. "
"18963410","18965710"," We just broke out of a out of a bull flag."
"18966670","18969230"," There's going to be a retest profit taking."
"18970230","18973830"," You have a few people yesterday that said they wanted the extra 20 points on Tesla. "
"18975210","18980170"," We talked to you yesterday at the close when to take the short on Tesla that wasn't yesterday it"
"18980170","18986320"," was today at the bell and you want to see that retest it's still bullish to retest 1150 or even"
"18986320","18989080"," 1100 is still bullish for Tesla right now."
"18989760","18997140"," As you've broken out of that bull flag there's no need for Tesla to move at this moment but let's"
"18997140","19000820"," say you're like I'm super ultra bullish right right here at 1150."
"19001000","19003180"," We're going to maintain the support and trade up. "
"19003540","19006640"," Just look back on Tesla a month chart three month chart."
"19007060","19012520"," There's usually a few days two three days five days of consolidation that it makes another move on"
"19012520","19013220"," the upper of the down."
"19013620","19016280"," You can usually see Tesla run like a hundred points. "
"19016460","19021600"," Sometimes it runs like 75 to 90 points and it will pull back and it will even go in the"
"19021600","19024000"," other direction 90 points to 130 points."
"19024940","19029700"," So look for you want to be looking for the way Tesla trades and right now it could go up"
"19029700","19037340"," to 1200 but in reality a lot of the time you'll see consolidation in Tesla to make that next move"
"19037340","19037540"," up."
"19038020","19041200"," So I feel like I want to buy a spread or I'm ultra bullish. "
"19042300","19043300"," I don't know what to say to you."
"19044980","19048000"," I know that the banks are down here wanting to buy it at 1100."
"19049040","19055580"," I know there are some buyers stepping up right now at 1125 more buyers stepping up risk here to"
"19055580","19058380"," risk on buyers taking it at 1131. "
"19060700","19067380"," I think this is to pump it up above 1150 to establish this support but if it's me I'm probably"
"19067380","19069000"," going to wait again for 1100."
"19070300","19076480"," Where were all you guys on Friday right we're burning into clothes on Friday nobody wanted to buy"
"19076480","19085090"," Tesla on the clothes on Friday nobody I mean even myself had to decide between Tesla or spy and I"

"19823560","19830300"," you can see that there is a by program right now on melly that began at 1200 you can see"
"19830300","19838990"," that down here at this 1200 you've got a huge bid this is bank buying for sure we're trying to"
"19838990","19848750"," get down to our granular level by the dip on melly is that 1230 or 1200 excuse me that's where"
"19848750","19859190"," the money supply is on melly right now let's"
"19859190","19870570"," look at melly in a one-year chart i like melly here not bad one two three my only"
"19870570","19878990"," issue with melly right here is that it was traded from 422 you want the honest truth i'll give you"
"19878990","19886350"," the honest truth you're not going to like this so melly the melly trade started on april first 2020"
"19886350","19896770"," so all these banks bought melly at 400 they traded it up to two thousand dollars and"
"19896770","19904150"," so they made 400 percent on their on their trade right they sold down out of melly down to 1232"
"19904150","19911070"," and then they rebot it back up again right they shorted it but bought it back up again a robot"
"19911070","19918150"," did an algorithm did write it back up it did not break all time new highs it failed to break"
"19918150","19927520"," all time new highs at 1969 and began to sell down again now it cratered at 1000 and it's traded"
"19927520","19937050"," back up to 1232 the thought would be that melly will fail once again"
"19937050","19946960"," to break out of this to break out of its negative that's what's bearish"
"19946960","19952420"," reversal channel right that's not going to break out of it it's failed to do that again i failed to"
"19952420","19958560"," do that on the 31st of december and you figure the trade is over if you want a price target"
"19958560","19969810"," on melly of my price target on melly is 744 that's terrible"
"19969810","19979610"," to say but that's the truth that's my price target 744 if"
"19981240","19987980"," there's a compelling reason why it should be higher let me know but it shouldn't why shouldn't it"
"19987980","19992280"," be higher because these banks want to take profit from that trade that they put on two years ago"
"19995570","20003610"," okay i have that it's another piece that another piece of the puzzle to"

"24627620","24639920"," that the vix popped up to 1677 into the close i"
"24639920","24649480"," would say be cautious here it might be better to not trade overnight"
