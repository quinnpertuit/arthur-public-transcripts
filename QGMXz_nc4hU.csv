"170","2650"," Ban on a naked short selling in the guilt market."
"16730","17690"," Check one tea."
"20450","22970"," So in this piece by the end of the year, there's a BK proposal. "
"23890","28180"," A foreign dude hanging in here."
"45630","46370"," Did more than out there."
"48190","57020"," For a second, she's got a 1.2.5 EE on a naked short selling of guilt, which prevents investors"
"57020","59860"," from entering a short position unless they have borrowed the underlying A."
"59860","60500"," Bonds. "
"61000","66760"," It's also planned to end a requirement to disclose sizable short positions in gilts to regulate and"
"66760","71060"," to overturn a ban on the naked purchases of credit default swaps."
"71600","76640"," Insurance like contracts that would pay out if the UK government defaulted on its debt."
"78020","80060"," Just got a couple of things in the background I got to do here. "
"81920","83160"," Morning, how's everybody doing out there?"
"85100","86020"," ADGG, 2004."
"86500","86960"," Thanks for following."
"87180","87560"," Appreciate it. "
"87680","89040"," Bonds on the fees for all those interested."
"90700","91800"," Morning, Jill, how are you?"
"92160","94060"," Bob Blanco, David AMS. Good morning. "
"95720","97100"," Uncle JBJ is out there."
"97260","97620"," Go, mother."
"98420","99480"," Coffee shop, John. "
"100780","101260"," Just a quick second."
"101400","105700"," I got a few things to look at this morning."
"105820","107020"," Some important stuff to look at. "
"109400","112060"," Give me just one second."
"112380","114700"," We have some important stuff to look at this morning."
"115760","121300"," I'm assuming that people are getting itchy out there. "
"122220","124420"," So we're going to talk about that getting itchy."
"126140","127660"," I think it's an important."
"132500","133100"," Members. "
"135180","138960"," See that just one quick second here."
"143120","145100"," We do have something to talk about."
"145300","145900"," Close. "
"149440","150040"," Twitter."
"154510","155070"," All right."
"156690","159530"," We do have something to talk about this morning. "
"159530","160550"," There's a nice gap up, right?"
"160930","163470"," You guys know what my take is on these gap ups."
"163810","164870"," You take the money and run."
"166310","168230"," You guys want to know what's going on in the opening bell?"
"169750","172830"," This is a five minute chart as long as we're above the white line. "
"173130","173830"," We are bullish."
"174130","175490"," We have two gaps down below."
"176750","177950"," Two clothes here. "
"179890","181650"," We have something else to look at, though."
"181830","184170"," It's an important thing to consider."
"186470","191890"," Oftentimes you can get in early sometimes. "
"194470","196330"," You know, call the turn, all that kind of stuff."
"201060","201820"," Let's see here."
"207460","209200"," Probably do like a bunch of stuff. "
"209360","210700"," Probably do this morning too, right?"
"212160","212600"," Okay."
"215460","216480"," Let's see everything up here."
"218060","220860"," Let's take a look at something, though, on this opening bell this morning. "
"220940","221660"," You got seven minutes left."
"221820","225080"," I want to talk to you guys about just something to consider here, okay?"
"226660","227100"," No."
"230550","235030"," I've got a monthly hedge here on spy. "
"235030","240990"," And, fascinatingly enough."
"248480","250280"," So this is SPX."
"250780","253500"," We are still below the early trigger in SPX. "
"254820","264560"," And though it is looking bullish at this point, with the bottom of"
"264560","267960"," velocity of velo, there should be a squeeze in SPX."
"267960","270020"," So at least this is showing a squeeze in SPX."
"271040","273700"," The SPX chart is still heading higher here. "
"274160","278020"," Even though I've got a little bit of rollover, sellers have failed here, right?"
"278360","278980"," They've failed once."
"279600","280280"," They've failed twice."
"281720","285640"," If you keep failing like this, it's going to lead to a squeeze, right?"
"285820","286520"," You already know that. "
"287960","292400"," I'm sure buyers are looking for that squeeze up."
"292600","297080"," Even if it's only to this point here to roll back over, maybe that's your CPI."
"300500","302240"," But sellers have failed. "
"302840","305800"," You got to remember there's one thing here is that we're into a new week, right?"
"306260","307000"," Vacation's over."
"308720","310600"," Fourth of July vacation is over."
"310760","312540"," People are starting to come back to work. "
"312900","314780"," The robots are still kind of trading right now."
"315440","316980"," The algos are still slightly trading."
"317260","319480"," But, you know, vacations were taken two weeks ago. "
"320000","321360"," People are back from vacation here."
"322760","324620"," Something else fascinating to see here, though."
"324820","325880"," This is the spy, right?"
"326000","327020"," We're going to get spy real quick. "
"328820","330740"," And we're coming into a turn."
"331600","335340"," I want to talk to you about what a turn can look like, what can happen here."
"336740","337900"," So do you see?"
"338280","340120"," I want you to look at this green line right here. "
"340220","343200"," When this starts to turn up, it's telling you there might be a turn."
"346020","349420"," The price is above, but we still failed the check."
"349420","355020"," And we traded down the false breakout right here, right?"
"355340","357780"," Kind of have that same thing going on right now. "
"359360","364100"," Do we come back down and check this here just to see if we have that big breakout that everybody's"
"364100","364640"," looking for?"
"366240","367140"," Or not."
"367580","369980"," And I want to call this like itchy finger."
"370380","375040"," I was almost going to call it dodge and weave this morning. "
"375040","378440"," But truth is it's more itchy finger."
"378440","382800"," One of the classic things you're looking for here on trend, at least."
"383240","384220"," And this is looking bullish here. "
"384680","385880"," It's all looks good to me."
"386640","390780"," It doesn't look bearish, but even so, though, it doesn't look bearish."
"392460","395580"," You always want to see like the first bounce above. "
"395920","396780"," We got that, right?"
"398780","399920"," Nice up move."
"400660","404860"," And you're still kind of looking for that retest and hold for a larger move."
"404860","408160"," One, two, minimum start plowing ahead. "
"408680","414200"," This was your first sign right here that this here at 4.30 in the afternoon yesterday."
"415760","417440"," And I like seeing that."
"417620","419520"," It's not like straight down to the depths of hell. "
"420320","422700"," We did bounce and test it at least once."
"423000","424440"," You can see it right on spy here."
"424660","427120"," You know there's a green line above on SPX. "
"428260","430080"," Here's a look at ES really quick."
"430720","432040"," So it's not that we can't go higher."
"432720","433860"," This looks great. "
"434000","434700"," This is all bullish."
"435440","437280"," This is a nice retest right here."
"437720","439560"," And you're seeing that turn, right?"
"439700","444480"," You're seeing all the signs that the market's going to go higher now. "
"444740","446940"," So the one trade above right here, this looks great."
"447140","447940"," Like this looks great here."
"448180","449080"," Boom, this is ES, right?"
"449360","450420"," Boom, one, two. "
"451280","453620"," And you should be trading up at some point."
"453980","460560"," And even if you could just buy this today, $44.40, it's a great place to tee off from."
"460560","463600"," This all looks healthy and like it's going to start to turn. "
"463960","467300"," So I'm assuming that's what people are thinking."
"468620","471600"," So if you're along here into the close yesterday, congratulations."
"473340","479600"," If you're looking for some sense of, is this a possibility to turn higher?"
"479700","480800"," It's starting to look like it. "
"481980","485000"," At least on spy and on ES that's looking like it."
"485180","487480"," SPX, for me."
"488360","489760"," And there's something else here too. "
"489880","491120"," Spy is on the downward, right?"
"492280","494320"," This is where sellers are stepping in, right?"
"494600","496720"," One, two, three, four."
"497480","499060"," And you're going to at least expect them."
"499640","504940"," So my only point here is there's a moment of, hey, let's wait a little bit and see if we"
"504940","507460"," can catch this run right here. "
"508120","510040"," So you kind of like looking for that."
"510440","511780"," You're looking, you don't want to be caught."
"511960","515000"," I guess you could trade this if you wanted off the open. "
"516900","517780"," You could trade."
"517840","518640"," We'll take a look at that."
"518780","519919"," We'll snap a line right there. "
"521980","525360"," You want to always be like the safety person, right?"
"526040","529820"," So $4.39.70 currently."
"531240","536880"," Or if it starts to gap up, you're looking for, you know, hey, I'm going to take the money and"
"536880","537740"," run to the opening bell."
"537880","542880"," We get up here and I'll wait for that trade to show itself. "
"544040","550200"," You take the next trade at $4.41 to get up here and trade this $4.42.50. It's $4 "
"550200","554440",".43. You want some safety and like the move was yesterday at the bell."
"554580","555120"," We knew that, right?"
"557100","558820"," And I had the bell at the end of the day."
"558920","560280"," We needed to go long at the end of the day. "
"560500","561980"," We knew to go long into the bell."
"562160","562820"," We needed to go long."
"563620","565740"," Maybe even into calls for this morning. "
"566780","571380"," I was trying to actually roll into calls for today and then I got so pissed off yesterday."
"571380","573280"," I was like, fuck this, I'm done."
"573860","575040"," And we knew it was gapping up. "
"577060","585320"," So just where we are, that trade is either like you're either entering the new trade here or you're"
"585320","586280"," entering a new trade above."
"587000","588880"," Any of this stuff right, it can be dangerous."
"589820","591200"," So you want to be grabbing it here. "
"591780","593560"," That's kind of like where you want to be grabbing it."
"593640","598460"," That's what, $4.40 and probably play $4.40 flat on spy at least."
"599500","605820"," So just right here, it's now $9.29. Here's that $4.40. It is right in here. "
"606700","607500"," It's right down here."
"607640","616540"," This is your hourly trigger is going to be $4.39.67. Somewhere right down in here."
"621840","623420"," Two gaps to close down below. "
"625940","629960"," And if you're like, hey, we're going to go straight off the screw you cap we're going all the way"
"629960","630960"," up right on the bell this morning."
"631840","637580"," $4.41.48. Here's that PT one right there from yesterday."
"640980","646600"," If we go up here and snap, if we hit this, I would still expect that roll over down here. "
"647360","649480"," Anything ain't break above and holding here."
"649700","652920"," We should trade down and then you'll get another move up higher over here."
"653600","655460"," So this PT one is a big move. "
"659760","663160"," If you're already long, that would be the target to the upside."
"663960","666020"," And then have some kind of consolidation roll down."
"666860","668400"," Maybe it's possibly into tomorrow. "
"669700","672820"," So if you're trying to enter a trade today, it's down below here somewhere."
"673280","674640"," Right down the cursor is here."
"675540","677140"," If you're already long, you like, fuck this. "
"677280","678280"," We're going up here off the bell."
"678520","678860"," I get it."
"680440","682420"," But there's no, there's no entry trade. "
"682840","683740"," I guess this is my point."
"684580","686040"," If you're not already long."
"686040","687640"," There is no trade for you, my view. "
"689120","689740"," It's right here."
"701160","702580"," And there's another concept here."
"702720","706560"," If price gets above the white line, you could take along as well. "
"706820","707460"," So we could do that too."
"708120","709300"," We can do that this morning."
"709640","713540"," So if we get above that white line right there, if price gets above and you want to trade it,"
"714000","715120"," then we can do that too. "
"717740","719120"," There's a nice green bar right here."
"723260","724360"," There's your PT one."
"730710","734890"," Look for two bars, a green bar here, red bar and a green bar in 15 minutes. "
"738640","740400"," So you get one green bar here."
"746500","748440"," Get one red bar right here."
"748740","751080"," It fails to get below this 440-052. "
"752260","754560"," You can take this next green bar and go straight up with it."
"755280","757040"," You're looking for something like that to enter a trade."
"759840","763540"," If you want that confirmation, you don't want to get caught inside of this. "
"764560","765740"," Selling into you."
"766520","768260"," Not always, but you know enough."
"770520","771140"," Good morning. "
"771220","771660"," How's everybody doing?"
"772140","773280"," Welcome back from vacation."
"773500","774120"," If you took a vacation."
"775020","776180"," We got my watch on. "
"776280","776660"," Hold on here."
"785480","791760"," And I guess my point behind this is that there's my point behind what I was originally saying to"
"791760","793280"," was that there's a."
"797160","797920"," There's a."
"802880","805680"," Let me see if I can show you guys this really quick and show you guys."
"805800","806480"," I'm talking about here. "
"806920","808460"," Second, I got to wind up my watch."
"809960","813000"," An old 1970s."
"818550","819510"," Hold on here. "
"823120","825040"," I've got the, what kind of watch do I have here?"
"825220","827400"," The Captain Willard."
"835230","841040"," An old Captain Willard watch."
"841360","841660"," Hold on a second. "
"847790","849190"," It needs to be wound up."
"850030","851110"," It hasn't been on my wrist."
"853370","853930"," Okay. "
"854870","857410"," So the point that I'm trying to make here is that."
"858950","860590"," There's a possible turn to the upside."
"862490","867810"," It's like, you know, it's making that turn right now and I can see that turn being made. "
"868170","868850"," If you look at."
"870830","874200"," Look at spy right now."
"875340","876460"," You see it, right?"
"879860","880940"," Let's see it right here. "
"881780","885020"," Roll down starting to roll back up again."
"885860","889180"," This curve right here is not bearish."
"889580","891920"," And matter what you think about CPI. "
"893620","896300"," When you start, we get no lows down here, right?"
"896500","897540"," No new lows down here."
"898860","902000"," High or low, high or low, high or low, high or low, high or low."
"903100","904540"," It's showing buyers are in control. "
"905360","906140"," And so."
"907840","908580"," Hold on here."
"908600","909400"," I'm going to grab some of this. "
"914620","915760"," Wait for me there."
"923340","924580"," Some long right now."
"939190","946010"," When you when you see this, it's showing you the way is up showing you that we like we do. "
"946170","946450"," Like yesterday."
"947870","949770"," The moment we broke over yesterday."
"950230","952010"," It was on like it was on. "
"953330","955790"," The failure of sellers yesterday."
"955890","958370"," They continue to sell down was a problem."
"958770","962630"," I was I was reading something about they were like, oh, it's been three down days for the spy. "
"963490","965770"," And I was kind of shocked because."
"967550","969850"," It's kind of shocked because I'm like three down days."
"969850","974070"," I remember we'd have 10, 12, 13, 14. "
"974630","978610"," Straight down days and we're, you know, like it's like, oh, you got three, you got three red bar"
"978610","978830"," day."
"978830","980130"," Or you got three red bar."
"981690","982530"," Three red bars. "
"982950","983650"," Sorry, buddy."
"983750","984890"," We're going long again already."
"986030","987430"," So you are looking for. "
"988190","991510"," You are looking for right up here at this PT one."
"993170","994510"," We're 41 40."
"994810","995370"," Yeah, somewhere right. "
"995950","996710"," It's even lower."
"996830","997490"," It's like right here."
"1001560","1003800"," It's the place for sellers like right up in here. "
"1003880","1004680"," You can actually see it."
"1005000","1008540"," If you're looking on a book map here, right?"
"1008540","1010700"," There's a big giant red bar right here."
"1011480","1014420"," It's kind of the place where sellers take over. "
"1015080","1020720"," They take over here and they've taken over somewhere right in here is where they want to be."
"1020860","1023280"," The same period of 2022."
"1025160","1027579"," So I was trying to take over right here, but. "
"1028780","1031640"," Watching that that fellow under from underneath."
"1032579","1034839"," And watching that turn that's taking place."
"1034839","1036480"," My point here to you is. "
"1038400","1040720"," There's those out there like to call bottoms, right?"
"1040920","1041720"," Hey, this is the bottom."
"1042940","1045859"," These sellers are not as strong as you might think."
"1046380","1047180"," That kind of stuff. "
"1047339","1048140"," So just right in here."
"1051420","1053020"," We're right in here right now."
"1054600","1060060"," And they've successfully teed off again and again and again and again up inside this area here. "
"1061640","1062320"," Now."
"1063040","1065880"," If price breaks above where those sellers are."
"1067300","1069380"," You're going to run them over. "
"1070080","1074360"," And squeeze uncontrollably to the upside like last off."
"1076100","1078720"," I'm trying to paint this picture for you here."
"1079380","1080220"," So there is. "
"1080900","1084100"," You know above this line here is a very strong."
"1085680","1087760"," Want to take calls."
"1087760","1090240"," So there's a trade here to the upside. "
"1092280","1094700"," And there's a consolidation up trade here."
"1096240","1098160"," And this would be the explosive move."
"1098300","1100260"," This is going to be like the squeeze trade right here. "
"1101460","1102100"," That's a P."
"1102220","1102800"," It should be a Q."
"1107520","1110760"," It looks like savage sausage squeeze or something."
"1111600","1113740"," So just know that right up in this area up here."
"1116600","1117980"," These are the sellers of Ben. "
"1118880","1121260"," I'll show it to you again in a different way to look at it."
"1123360","1125340"," So just just as we're looking at here."
"1125860","1126780"," You can see it right here. "
"1128300","1130520"," And you know they're going to want to tee off on this right."
"1131560","1133060"," We're doing it perfectly right."
"1133400","1133680"," What limit. "
"1138000","1139560"," Right here did it right here."
"1140080","1140620"," Right here."
"1140940","1142240"," Matter of fact I've got puts from up here. "
"1143740","1144380"," Right down here."
"1146060","1149840"," And right here though is where my point two would be right here."
"1149840","1150960"," They want to step back in. "
"1151600","1153640"," They were from here to here."
"1153640","1155160"," They're trying to step into sell again."
"1156760","1157800"," And if they get overrun. "
"1158860","1159680"," Bam right here right."
"1160240","1161920"," You will you'll take all this out right."
"1162020","1163340"," You'll take or you'll take that one out. "
"1163460","1164300"," You'll take this one out."
"1165040","1166500"," Take that one out up there."
"1166860","1169640"," It'll just be like very explosive move. "
"1174240","1176220"," So pay attention to this this morning."
"1176760","1179300"," If it rolls and it puts dangerous as well in here."
"1179440","1185140"," So my point two also on this is even when you squeeze up you tend to want to consolidate again"
"1185140","1187380"," to see if we can push higher. "
"1188220","1189600"," Just pay attention to that."
"1193280","1194240"," 441 47."
"1197700","1198740"," 441 47. "
"1199120","1200080"," Let me bring this down for you."
"1200280","1201500"," 441 47."
"1202940","1204540"," It's that PT one from yesterday. "
"1205900","1207020"," So you can see it."
"1211840","1217380"," I'm fascinated by this because I've got puts on for the well I got a monthly put on for the"
"1217380","1220060"," I think it's August 10th or August 11th."
"1220060","1223720"," For middle of the month down move into the 21st and. "
"1225880","1229500"," I still make money and calls all the way through lots of money yesterday."
"1229700","1234080"," But I had calls for the last squeeze made money make money right now making good money right now."
"1235140","1237740"," So we'll see how this plays out. "
"1238660","1241360"," Do I take the puts off if it gets overrun."
"1243760","1246440"," That positionally if that thing gets run over here."
"1247580","1249860"," You can see this all is already stepping in right now. "
"1250660","1252100"," They're like pissed off up here."
"1255740","1260400"," I know they're I know they're here I know they're right here and I know they're right here too."
"1261360","1263680"," Big yellow box of sellers right here. "
"1264360","1266240"," Big old box supply right here."
"1267680","1272020"," But the question becomes is this the is this the same place or is it not."
"1274560","1275440"," So we'll find out. "
"1285860","1289460"," See it's a little stinky there big old red bar right here."
"1294160","1297180"," You're thinking that they front run the CPI print for tomorrow."
"1298040","1300180"," I don't believe that it has anything to do with CPI. "
"1300180","1301400"," I'll be honest with you guys."
"1304060","1305560"," I'm less and less."
"1307300","1308480"," I'm less and less. "
"1311020","1312140"," I'm not saying."
"1312260","1319270"," If it's if it's really unknown to the marketplace then."
"1321100","1323280"," I'm not really going to. "
"1323900","1324820"," Let's take it here."
"1330850","1332910"," I'm less and less than the belief of."
"1334050","1337910"," Less and less than the beliefs that belief system of holding a grab some of this. "
"1351200","1354140"," I'm less and less of the belief that CPI really matters."
"1354140","1357260"," Our most news matters unless you don't know what it is."
"1357980","1360300"," So like earnings can get kind of crazy. "
"1360540","1361340"," Unnote events."
"1361580","1362860"," The market can get kind of crazy."
"1363780","1364720"," Come on down there. "
"1365840","1380420"," A little"
"1380420","1381160"," bit more down here."
"1413700","1416080"," There's one more right down here."
"1426000","1427160"," Let's grab all this. "
"1427340","1431020"," I just got the whole bunch of fucking calls down here to start with like 25 now."
"1431180","1431780"," I'm like a hundred."
"1440740","1442780"," It's a little more gap down here needs to be filled. "
"1453700","1454520"," It's like CPI."
"1457360","1461760"," Not really like it's weird like I've been trading less and less with the news."
"1462060","1465760"," I get it on here in the background, but I've been trading less and less with the news and. "
"1466800","1470880"," I've made more money not particularly listening to the news."
"1471540","1474780"," Or the anticipation of news or any of that kind of stuff."
"1476300","1477020"," Well, maybe. "
"1489730","1492930"," That was almost the perfect strike of our HT right there."
"1493770","1495590"," It's that hourly trigger that I'm showing you here."
"1496770","1498030"," So you can see it right there. "
"1498970","1501230"," Almost a perfect pin strike on HT."
"1502450","1504410"," See that pin strike right down there?"
"1504550","1505490"," Watch my cursor right there."
"1505730","1506910"," You guys can't see all this, can you?"
"1512640","1513680"," One right there. "
"1518140","1520780"," There's another little gap to fill down below here."
"1522880","1524840"," That perfect pin strike right there."
"1531520","1535410"," I guess it is lower isn't it?"
"1536110","1538970"," A little bit lower. "
"1547860","1554840"," Don't forget there's a little bit of gap down here at 439.41 and 439.30. You don't want to"
"1554840","1555440"," see this reverse."
"1564300","1566620"," Bring this Roy back down here, tag this."
"1567820","1569300"," Then you get your actual move higher. "
"1570660","1571740"," Just be careful of that."
"1580380","1582200"," You know they're angry up here, right?"
"1582420","1584060"," We should draw this in."
"1593850","1596170"," It's like there's your angry sellers right here, right?"
"1596310","1597470"," That's your PT one up here. "
"1597790","1601690"," You know these are your angry sellers from the box that I showed you earlier."
"1602310","1603650"," This is where the sellers are."
"1603970","1605690"," This is where I am on the monthly. "
"1605970","1606490"," This is right up here."
"1607950","1609950"," You know they're going to want to sell this down."
"1610170","1613710"," I want to direct your attention back to one thing even more importantly. "
"1614470","1618230"," We're going to look at SPX real quick."
"1627830","1629270"," That's right there."
"1634960","1636320"," One hour chart is where. "
"1642920","1643900"," One second here."
"1665020","1666740"," January, February, March."
"1681250","1682710"," You see this down here. "
"1683090","1684330"," This is kind of garbage, right?"
"1685090","1687090"," This is March, right?"
"1688550","1689070"," April, excuse me."
"1689690","1695170"," Here's the 26th of Q2 or Q1, excuse me."
"1697650","1703270"," Then I still squeeze up and you get this roll over down below, right?"
"1703850","1705530"," Then you actually make your way up. "
"1705990","1714190"," This isn't until end of April for the new quarter, right?"
"1714930","1715950"," April 27th."
"1716790","1717970"," You had something similar."
"1718890","1722030"," This is that sideways market rotation consolidation. "
"1722570","1726450"," Then you finally get to move up going the last two months."
"1726950","1730850"," I want to bring your attention also to the December."
"1731730","1733350"," That's something similar down here. "
"1737400","1739000"," I guess you get your move up here."
"1740440","1742420"," We'll have a second here."
"1742780","1747340"," You get your first move up here with the new low here back in March 30th, 10th. "
"1748680","1750540"," Then my thought process here is the same."
"1750760","1752460"," You get that same kind of move down here."
"1752580","1755460"," The late quarter push up a little bit down here. "
"1757140","1759900"," Expect an expectation of possibly that same thing happening here."
"1759900","1761180"," It's a middle of month."
"1761340","1764400"," Clean all this up into the 28th. "
"1765200","1767200"," Then you get your actual move higher up in here."
"1767920","1768980"," It's going to break down."
"1769620","1770940"," You can see it right there. "
"1771220","1772500"," It's maybe down here to 432."
"1773720","1775140"," Possibly close out that 420."
"1775820","1777860"," Then you get your actual move to the upside. "
"1779540","1781820"," I'm trying to fucking sell this down one more time."
"1783080","1784540"," This is the idea here."
"1784720","1786000"," You still clean this stuff up. "
"1787260","1788940"," Still on trend to the upside."
"1789940","1790960"," Make that a little bit cleaner."
"1795100","1799020"," It's staying on trend, but your actual bias down here. "
"1799500","1800000"," Pitch lace move."
"1800200","1800660"," Maybe that's CPI."
"1801740","1803540"," You can call whatever you want to call it. "
"1806900","1808540"," Then you get your higher highs."
"1808700","1809320"," You get your 465."
"1809660","1810960"," That kind of stuff on the monthly. "
"1812300","1815220"," Just a little weakness here in the beginning of the quarter."
"1815540","1818320"," Now, there's another idea here would be as we head into September."
"1820580","1822160"," September will actually be our week month. "
"1822380","1836370"," We make it mad dash to top of mad dash to"
"1836370","1839970"," the top of the JPM caller."
"1840470","1842050"," Then we roll down into September."
"1842250","1844210"," Everybody likes to sell September, October. "
"1845550","1847050"," Get all kinds of nastiness."
"1847330","1847910"," November, right?"
"1848710","1849710"," Tell you the market's going to crash."
"1849950","1850510"," All that kind of stuff. "
"1850510","1852330"," Half down zero spot, one percent."
"1857550","1859430"," Get this little gap right down here."
"1861330","1862730"," I'll draw this gap in. "
"1868600","1871340"," At any point we trade below this."
"1872060","1876760"," According to a commission spokesperson, the EU and Australia fail to reach an agreement on free"
"1876760","1877760"," trade deal talks."
"1879140","1887250"," At any point we start to sell underneath this. "
"1887490","1889270"," You can see the bear cross right here."
"1890010","1890730"," You can see it."
"1891390","1893890"," The bear plane right here. "
"1894010","1898950"," If price cannot get above, I'll cut some calls loose and we'll roll this down and begin to sell."
"1907510","1908690"," Then the gap right here."
"1909010","1910490"," Five minute charts got the gap even lower. "
"1911350","1913750"," So you got a gap there and you got another gap right here."
"1931580","1934320"," Five minute chart gap is a one minute chart gap right here."
"1949880","1951500"," Sellers going back to the top. "
"1965840","1966700"," Major high."
"1972790","1973590"," Maybe that works."
"1986130","1986790"," You're scared?"
"1986990","1987370"," I'm not scared. "
"1991430","1992990"," I don't know why you're scared."
"1993190","1993790"," You shouldn't be scared."
"1996790","1999570"," You're going to see pissed off sellers here right. "
"2000170","2002070"," These are the sellers going back to the last major high."
"2002290","2002950"," They're going to step in."
"2003070","2003570"," You already know that. "
"2004690","2007890"," You already know that if price goes above."
"2010650","2016430"," Here that you're going to squeeze all these sellers out including myself right off the clothes."
"2016430","2019430"," My puts if we get up here and do this kind of nonsense anything like this. "
"2019430","2024310"," I have to sell my monthly positional downside move."
"2024810","2025830"," So you already know they're here."
"2026310","2027510"," You know they're down here. "
"2028090","2029610"," I'm going to try to push it out."
"2029890","2031210"," Now do I think we can get up there?"
"2031450","2031970"," Yeah I do."
"2032650","2033670"," I think we can get up there. "
"2033750","2034770"," I think we can squeeze them out."
"2035850","2037050"," But they're pissed off right."
"2037370","2037930"," That's what they're going to do. "
"2038030","2039930"," They're going to step in and sell that they're going to tee off there."
"2040190","2041170"," Works every time right."
"2041590","2043830"," Bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"2043830","2048389"," But hourly trigger, hourly velocity is saying that we're going to squeeze up there."
"2048790","2049190"," So."
"2051270","2051969"," I'm not scared. "
"2052210","2053170"," You got to be scared."
"2053170","2056710"," I want to see it's a five minute try right now to be scared."
"2056870","2058850"," Well I guess prices below the white line. "
"2058850","2059770"," So that's bearish."
"2060409","2062810"," But I do want to see rejection here."
"2064250","2066489"," I'm back up and then take it. "
"2066630","2067130"," Take it short."
"2068270","2069870"," We'll run it down for like two, three days."
"2080820","2081219"," PayPal. "
"2081219","2088380"," PayPal above my trigger now."
"2088820","2091440"," It's been above the trigger for some time period, hasn't it?"
"2092219","2098000"," It's been above since July 10th."
"2100180","2101500"," See how July 10th. "
"2102040","2102460"," It's been up."
"2102640","2103280"," It's been yes."
"2103560","2105660"," I bet I'm long PayPal and investment count. "
"2105880","2106000"," So."
"2107280","2108580"," Since July 10th."
"2108620","2110100"," You see a soft sellers come in. "
"2110340","2111240"," You want to see PayPal real quick?"
"2119160","2120360"," Well, PayPal's been great."
"2120860","2124540"," So I don't know why I got to buy back here on July 10th."
"2124900","2127920"," You should be long and then 68, 64. "
"2128760","2133820"," Somewhere in here you can buy this 68, 64 and then 66, 71."
"2135000","2137680"," You do have sellers above up here at 71, 55."
"2148020","2149260"," I think that I got to watch it. "
"2149400","2151320"," I got to do say I got to watch my I got some calls here."
"2152380","2153380"," Hold on one second here."
"2160210","2161630"," These red bars right here are concerning. "
"2164910","2166730"," I hate fucking buying puts."
"2167010","2167850"," They're so fucking there."
"2167950","2170370"," They suck so bad in a bull market. "
"2174720","2175260"," 438."
"2175760","2176500"," That's 439."
"2176860","2177000"," 40. "
"2177260","2177540"," 439."
"2177820","2178020"," 20."
"2178860","2180760"," Like 40 fucking cents right now. "
"2180840","2181920"," And I don't want anything to do with them."
"2182220","2182820"," I'm not buying them."
"2184920","2185980"," Now PayPal. "
"2187260","2189500"," You want a place to buy PayPal?"
"2190620","2191140"," 68."
"2191620","2192100"," 59."
"2193560","2194080"," 66. "
"2196460","2198000"," You do have sellers."
"2198200","2199400"," Let me go back to this PayPal real quick."
"2200720","2203180"," You just like puts like just don't pay, dude. "
"2205600","2208720"," I guess they pay like one out of."
"2212140","2213480"," There's PayPal here."
"2214620","2216520"," They're going to make me cut loose, aren't they?"
"2217660","2219180"," I'll come back to PayPal. "
"2229820","2231400"," I fucking hate puts, dude."
"2231540","2233020"," They're like, they're such dog shit."
"2234360","2237080"," They never like hold value even when they're trying to sell this. "
"2237520","2238900"," Look at them down here trying to tee off."
"2239820","2240860"," Very revenge sell this."
"2263320","2264220"," We'll come back to PayPal. "
"2266540","2267980"," As a place to buy it though."
"2268540","2269120"," I don't know."
"2269860","2272140"," You've got sellers above the other side. "
"2272260","2272780"," I give you those first ones."
"2272780","2273140"," There's two numbers."
"2273620","2279040"," You've got definitely have sellers above at 71.60. They're going to get overrun. "
"2279400","2281320"," Oh, look at it now."
"2281520","2281880"," 30 minutes."
"2285410","2287490"," I can't say they're going to get overrun here. "
"2293460","2298380"," It's a better trade right now in PayPal above $71."
"2302000","2305420"," You have to be above 71 and hold it too."
"2305420","2309260"," Like you'd buy it again above $71 and hold it. "
"2310000","2311460"," The move is higher in PayPal."
"2312480","2314420"," They're going to get aggressive on you."
"2314440","2316920"," They're going to try to sell it down without a doubt. "
"2324810","2326350"," Why puts shouldn't pay?"
"2326650","2327030"," They are cheaper."
"2327410","2330450"," You don't have to find a reason why that puts don't pay."
"2331270","2333010"," I used to have a white paper on it. "
"2336730","2342660"," Let me explain it."
"2342660","2343900"," Let me see if I can get this guy."
"2355640","2356860"," Let me see if I can get this for you. "
"2363270","2364430"," Originally, you can only buy."
"2365470","2365970"," I don't know."
"2366170","2367090"," I used to have this paper. "
"2367310","2369010"," I don't know what the fuck happened to it."
"2371630","2373590"," Let me see if I can find it on the internet maybe."
"2379860","2381420"," I don't know what where it is anymore. "
"2387920","2392780"," There was a great paper, a white paper that was written years ago."
"2394060","2395760"," I can't find it."
"2396260","2396660"," It's funny. "
"2396840","2401280"," I just looked up the puts do not pay."
"2402520","2404500"," Child support from South Carolina came up."
"2404900","2405440"," Fuckin' amen. "
"2412330","2414930"," It used to be a really good one."
"2417700","2418300"," Sorry."
"2418520","2419880"," Let me rephrase this. "
"2420200","2427700"," I read this white paper years ago that discussed how the stock market started."
"2427940","2429820"," It started with stock options."
"2430400","2431820"," Yes, it was not options. "
"2432100","2434160"," It shares of stock."
"2434720","2437240"," That's all they had."
"2437540","2438740"," They didn't actually have options. "
"2439460","2440020"," It was just stocks."
"2441040","2441640"," Shares."
"2442680","2443920"," Then they developed calls. "
"2443920","2446240"," They didn't actually develop puts right away."
"2447400","2449320"," The calls next came into existence."
"2450560","2452600"," Then you had puts come into existence. "
"2454500","2456540"," They weren't structured."
"2457120","2461340"," So calls were structured for speculation in mind."
"2462560","2464240"," That's the thesis behind a call. "
"2465820","2468860"," Speculation for stocks to go up."
"2470100","2478140"," When puts were designed, they weren't designed for speculation to make money if your underlying"
"2478140","2480100"," share price went down."
"2480820","2487200"," They were designed to protect your underlying position in a stock. "
"2489220","2491640"," So these are protective puts, right?"
"2492580","2496680"," So they're not designed and built to be like a call."
"2496880","2499100"," They're raised with us at 9.30am eastern."
"2499360","2500140"," Pay like a call. "
"2500400","2501740"," Live with our very own Tony."
"2502180","2506020"," There's a very cheap way to hedge against your underlying position."
"2507240","2508220"," You can find this paper. "
"2511840","2516990"," It's just a fascinating read."
"2519210","2522730"," You can find it on the internet here."
"2541970","2545070"," I keep saying I'm going to look for it and find it, but I don't know where the fuck it"
"2545070","2545470"," is anymore. "
"2546450","2547750"," I got to dig for it somewhere."
"2548890","2550970"," It was a great paper to read."
"2552310","2555010"," I think it was during Volmageddon that paper came out. "
"2557890","2561580"," I got to find this fucking thing."
"2563140","2565000"," Does anybody remember this white paper out there?"
"2565000","2566340"," What are you guys watching right now over that paper?"
"2572280","2574260"," Brittany, are you in Paris right now?"
"2574440","2574820"," Are you in France?"
"2577360","2578500"," Good morning, Brittany."
"2579620","2581780"," Are you at a Twitch con or what?"
"2588730","2590010"," Yeah, I'm sitting in them right now. "
"2590090","2591470"," I've got a stack of them."
"2595260","2597380"," You're in London right now?"
"2615630","2619910"," What's the deal with Twitch streamers being assaulted in Paris right now?"
"2621670","2624010"," They said, is this real staged or real?"
"2641840","2642960"," Yeah, you enjoy it."
"2642960","2643300"," It was nice. "
"2644420","2644980"," Morning."
"2645180","2645740"," How are you?"
"2645740","2651740"," Yeah, I guess two streamers, nuts and break J stream."
"2653220","2655180"," They're claiming that they were assaulted. "
"2656120","2659020"," But I'm like, yeah, if you're in Paris, you can get assaulted in two seconds."
"2659320","2662740"," Well, Paris is great, but you fuck around in any city."
"2662900","2663520"," You're going to get assaulted. "
"2668980","2671820"," I guess you have a wrong place, wrong time of the day."
"2677910","2679390"," Yeah, K-N-U-T."
"2681690","2686230"," It says, according to, yeah, not like K-N-U-T and then break J stream. "
"2687970","2690070"," They face the salty different places in Paris."
"2690330","2693210"," Both of them have shared their stories of what happened during the strolls in the evening."
"2693810","2695370"," So they like claiming strolls in the evening. "
"2695570","2699310"," I'm like, yeah, from the wrong place in any city."
"2700030","2702810"," I'm trying to sell this thing down so hard."
"2703050","2703450"," Look at them. "
"2704450","2705950"," It's so saucy here."
"2709010","2711830"," Let me check on HYG real quick."
"2712930","2714490"," Vix, I'm looking at Dixie. "
"2714930","2716410"," Dixie looks pretty bullish right now."
"2717090","2718130"," Nasdaq rolling over."
"2718890","2720510"," IWM green right now. "
"2722110","2724690"," Very bullish on IWM, as you probably already know."
"2725530","2726730"," It's trading right now to the upside."
"2731350","2732610"," I'm trying to roll this over. "
"2732870","2735990"," Big old bear plane on the 6th and 27."
"2736890","2742990"," I've got another bear plane forming right now on the spy, 5th and 27th and 129th."
"2743450","2744390"," See you right here. "
"2744610","2746410"," 50 basis point Bank of England."
"2746730","2747550"," Great hike in August."
"2750130","2751290"," Right here. "
"2758240","2759360"," Can't do puts, man."
"2759440","2760120"," I can't do it."
"2760240","2762200"," I'm like, I want nothing to do with it. "
"2764960","2771860"," Oh, you ran into him walking around to 2 AM streaming?"
"2773080","2774200"," Yeah, that's what I'm thinking."
"2774460","2777480"," Like when you're in any city two o'clock in the morning, you're streaming."
"2777660","2778600"," You get to camera out or something. "
"2779040","2781000"," I don't know who these guys are."
"2781000","2782500"," I don't know anything about the streams."
"2782560","2783320"," I should check them out. "
"2783520","2790520"," But any city two o'clock in the morning, especially a city like Paris, New York, Chicago, anywhere"
"2790520","2791080"," like that."
"2791860","2794100"," You're walking around to a clock and we're just asking for trouble."
"2794900","2797720"," People are like, I'm going to go fuck that guy up over there. "
"2798540","2799080"," Guys, a streamer."
"2803960","2808990"," I can't wait for Vegas."
"2809470","2810630"," I'm like super stoked on it. "
"2810630","2814890"," I saw you asking people who was going to Paris."
"2815150","2815970"," I'm like, man, I want to go."
"2816150","2817390"," I would love to go. "
"2818190","2820810"," And then people are complaining about the riots in Paris."
"2821070","2828270"," But I'm like, yeah, I'm like, you go to any city and you're like, yeah, those two streets over"
"2828270","2828530"," there."
"2829970","2831610"," Is it the entire city?"
"2831890","2831930"," No. "
"2836860","2838180"," Yeah, depends on the neighborhood, right?"
"2866850","2871350"," Ernie, you guys on, Ernie, you guys on threads?"
"2872770","2874590"," We were talking about that last week, right?"
"2875470","2876990"," Oh, look at that."
"2877170","2878810"," This gap's gone."
"2879690","2881370"," Next gap is gone right here. "
"2881590","2882410"," Stick this gap out."
"2883150","2883790"," Get rid of that one."
"2884950","2886510"," Next gap down below, right here. "
"2892000","2893740"," So much drama from Sellers."
"2897660","2900360"," They do not want to see the market going up here."
"2900600","2902080"," They want their, they're so angry. "
"2902680","2904800"," So much sauce from Sellers right now."
"2905500","2906420"," I'm still sitting in calls."
"2906780","2907400"," I got a bunch of them. "
"2907940","2909600"," I'm going to add some more right now."
"2921400","2922900"," So much sauce here, man."
"2923100","2928510"," These Sellers are like revenge trading. "
"2928870","2931770"," I mean, I've got, dude, I've got fucking 20K inputs."
"2932750","2934190"," So I get why they're doing this."
"2937910","2939970"," We were talking about it yesterday. "
"2942050","2946970"," That these hedge funds, man, these fucking hedge funds, want a good price."
"2947950","2952390"," They're taking loans out of banks so they can log the market."
"2953010","2954870"," And they want so bad. "
"2955690","2958870"," To get, they want so bad, dude, they want to get a good price."
"2959070","2959470"," They want 420."
"2961690","2965270"," And anything they can do to get into a good price, they will. "
"2968630","2969450"," When is Vegas?"
"2969750","2970730"," Vegas is in October."
"2971770","2972070"," I was wondering."
"2972370","2975510"," I was going to ask Joe Harper to go with me. "
"2985980","2989060"," It's October 20th until October 22nd."
"2990200","2994760"," Friday, October 20th until Sunday, October 22nd."
"2994760","2997560"," It's actually a really nice time of the year in Vegas, believe it or not. "
"2997680","2999520"," Actually, it's very bearable there."
"2999660","3000260"," The weather is good."
"3002360","3005620"," Every time I go to Vegas, it's like the perfect amount of time, too. "
"3006540","3007320"," Like three days."
"3007900","3008740"," That's all you need in Vegas."
"3009100","3011200"," Like three days is the perfect time in Vegas. "
"3012900","3014360"," No less and no more."
"3014840","3017120"," You go into a week and you're like, get me the fuck out of here."
"3021880","3022460"," Oh, really?"
"3023700","3025500"," Dude, if that's our meetup, Joe. "
"3026800","3027780"," Let's do it, brother."
"3027980","3030640"," I thought I asked you if you wanted to go with me."
"3030900","3032800"," I don't have anybody to go with me so far. "
"3032940","3033880"," We got nobody coming with me."
"3034020","3036580"," I thought I'd be a blast."
"3037520","3039720"," And I like Vegas under the right circumstances. "
"3040460","3043560"," If you're there for the right reasons, it's awesome."
"3045900","3048120"," It can be a really bad place, too."
"3050840","3059680"," I got mugged ones, but I was, uh, uh, one of my best, uh, I had some, I had some"
"3059680","3060620"," weird Vegas stories. "
"3061420","3063860"," Uh, so one time I was in Vegas."
"3063900","3067840"," So one time, I got some funny Vegas stories, to be honest with you."
"3069700","3073960"," So I got one time I was in Vegas and I was wasted. "
"3074840","3076280"," And it was very late at night."
"3077060","3078280"," And I was going back to my hotel."
"3079780","3081780"," And I'm stumbling back to my hotel. "
"3082120","3083040"," I was about with a bunch of friends."
"3084280","3085740"," And it wasn't pretty."
"3087000","3089360"," And I had separated from my group. "
"3090600","3092860"," And I'm heading back to my hotel room."
"3093960","3099920"," And I was walking through the casino, like, you know, the casino's like, to get to your room, you"
"3099920","3100720"," have to walk through the casino."
"3101200","3102060"," You know, I'm like, okay. "
"3102720","3104620"," So I'm walking through the casino to get to my room."
"3105860","3112360"," And someone tried to pickpocket me, lift my wallet out of my, uh, they knew I was, I was, had"
"3112360","3113760"," been drinking or whatever, having a good time."
"3116340","3120720"," And so they, so I get, I get my wallet, they're, they're trying to lift my wallet from me and"
"3120720","3121400"," I can feel it. "
"3121860","3123900"," I can feel the girl inside of my pocket."
"3124880","3126620"," I'm just going to hand my pocket and pull my wallet out."
"3127660","3129820"," I put my hand behind my ass and I grab it. "
"3130560","3133140"," And it's got her hand inside my ass."
"3135200","3137680"," And as I catch her, I start to turn around."
"3138960","3140660"," And, uh, she starts screaming. "
"3142820","3144640"," And she's got people with her."
"3145480","3147720"," And she starts to scream, uh, salt."
"3149620","3153180"," And, uh, it was wild. "
"3154160","3155760"," And I was like, what the fuck are you doing?"
"3156480","3157760"," Uh, something like that."
"3159300","3163740"," And, uh, they're trying to, they're like, please close this fucking gap so we can go up."
"3166600","3172440"," And, uh, so I'm sitting there and, uh, I get, I, like, catch this girl. "
"3173040","3176120"," She starts, and I grab her, like, I grab her hand in my ass."
"3177540","3178880"," And I'm not letting go."
"3179060","3180640"," I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?"
"3181740","3183820"," And, uh, so she starts screaming, assault. "
"3185700","3187540"," And security came out of nowhere."
"3189000","3191340"," Like they were coming out of, like, hidden doors and shit."
"3191500","3192080"," It was really wild. "
"3192080","3194760"," And they grabbed me."
"3195880","3197580"," Uh, like they're going to arrest me."
"3199200","3202680"," Uh, and like that ties and all of the craziness was really wild. "
"3203680","3208400"," And, uh, she started saying, like, this guy's drunk."
"3208540","3209420"," He just grabbed me."
"3209760","3210520"," It's assaulting me. "
"3211240","3212440"," And they're just listening to her."
"3213760","3220060"," Uh, and I'm like, I'm drunk, but I'm sober enough to know that I'm getting my stuff stolen."
"3220060","3225260"," So, uh, these security guards, I'm like, look, I'm like, I'm staying here at the hotel. "
"3225440","3226960"," I've got a pass card on me."
"3227380","3232820"," I go, but please, I'm like, this person over here just tried to steal my wallet from my pocket."
"3233220","3236280"," And you just check the security camera footage. "
"3237540","3241560"," And so, uh, they fucking, they fucking, like, zip-tied me."
"3242980","3245620"," And she was, they were waiting."
"3246160","3250040"," And they called and sure enough, uh, they had seen her. "
"3250040","3251460"," They were trying to pickpocket me."
"3253320","3255620"," And, uh, so they grabbed, like, her and all her friends."
"3255880","3256400"," They had them all corn. "
"3256520","3257600"," It was, like, fucking 20."
"3258180","3258940"," Maybe, like, not 20."
"3259140","3260720"," Like, 10 security guards there. "
"3261460","3262760"," And, uh, they ended up grabbing this woman."
"3264840","3268000"," Uh, no, I'm in, I'm in calls right now."
"3268060","3268620"," I got a bunch of them. "
"3269180","3270020"," I got a whole stack of them."
"3271140","3272140"," They are more than a stack."
"3274520","3275220"," They got a bunch of calls. "
"3276740","3278620"," So, um, it was really wild."
"3278620","3282900"," And so, they're, like, go up to your room and go to sleep."
"3283060","3284320"," And I'm like, okay. "
"3284540","3285520"," So, they cut me loose."
"3286520","3287960"," Uh, and they grabbed these people."
"3288080","3291420"," And I'm like, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one over there. "
"3292120","3293220"," And they grabbed these people."
"3293740","3295740"," And, yeah, nobody had, nobody had a hotel."
"3296060","3297180"," These were all, like, people from Vegas. "
"3299880","3301800"," And, uh, so I learned my lesson."
"3301980","3303380"," That was one first lesson I ever learned."
"3303580","3308240"," I was like, number one, don't get wasted and walk around Las Vegas alone. "
"3308240","3309340"," Late at night."
"3309820","3310720"," You're like a mark."
"3311000","3312280"," You're, like, stand right out. "
"3312700","3314440"," Um, they're going to try to take you."
"3314820","3316060"," So, we're going to see what's going to happen here."
"3316300","3317120"," I've got a bunch of calls. "
"3317300","3318100"," I'm buying a bunch of them."
"3318160","3318700"," They're cheap anyways."
"3319580","3323360"," Um, and I'm looking for a trade higher still. "
"3324320","3328920"," Uh, the one thing that I have fair here of is, uh, I'm going to be looking for."
"3331040","3332200"," I'm going to see them change this."
"3337260","3339240"," We're going to see what the interaction is here. "
"3339760","3342380"," Uh, because this can be very violent to the downside."
"3342740","3343620"," So, I'm going to be aware of this."
"3344900","3349200"," You're going to be looking for, uh, I'm pretty big rejection up here. "
"3349440","3352080"," So, it should squeeze."
"3353360","3355540"," It should get some kind of a squeeze here."
"3356360","3358640"," And, uh, you should see something like this. "
"3359080","3363160"," What I don't want to see, uh, is a reversal to the downside."
"3363540","3367480"," If we begin to, uh, reverse to the downside, I will, uh, take my losses here."
"3367480","3370840"," And we will, uh, begin to go to the downside. "
"3371600","3372900"," Uh, this won't mean anything here."
"3373260","3375620"," This gap won't mean shit if this happens right here."
"3376220","3379920"," Uh, we will blast through and, uh, we'll begin a big move down. "
"3380440","3381440"," Uh, that won't stop."
"3381740","3385540"," So, this move here to the downside, we're going to talk about this if it happens."
"3386060","3388780"," Uh, and where the, where the targets would be. "
"3389200","3391280"," And they will be, uh, new lows."
"3391880","3396680"," So, all this will get taken out, uh, 435, 95 will get taken out."
"3397260","3399960"," So, we're going to watch this right now and see if that's the case. "
"3400600","3406600"," Um, if you're not input positions, uh, you can probably take a weekly put out."
"3407400","3411540"," If we start, if we begin to break below, uh, this hourly trigger."
"3411760","3413800"," Any of this kind of stuff right here and this kind of move. "
"3414180","3416120"," It's a multi-day move right here to the downside."
"3416540","3418260"," So, we'll see if this takes place."
"3419660","3423320"," See if the bears or sellers are actually in charge here in cash market. "
"3423460","3424780"," I don't think that they are."
"3424780","3430080"," So, I'm not believing these, uh, these sellers, I think they're pissed off and they're trying to"
"3430080","3432360"," get it down there, but I don't think they can do it in cash market."
"3432360","3434300"," So, uh, we'll see. "
"3434560","3435520"," But it is setting up."
"3435660","3436440"," So, just be aware of it."
"3436960","3438800"," You're seeing that green bar come up right now. "
"3439600","3445940"," Um, so anyways, um, that was my first, that was the first time I learned never to be alone in"
"3445940","3446140"," Vegas."
"3446540","3451780"," So, like those two streamers, uh, I was caught in this dude and it was really weird because I'm"
"3451780","3454720"," like, I'm like, this woman's like saying I'm grabbing her."
"3454820","3455900"," I'm like, fuck out of my face. "
"3455900","3458460"," Like, you have a fucking unique woman I want."
"3458720","3459800"," Like, sorry."
"3461100","3464760"," Cause they don't need to be grabbing, no, like some skank from fucking Nevada. "
"3465500","3466780"," Las Vegas in the middle of the night."
"3467640","3469820"," Uh, but thankfully there was, there was security cameras."
"3470060","3470360"," Thank you. "
"3470500","3473160"," Thankfully they have, they're like eyes everywhere in Vegas."
"3473500","3476240"," It's like, if that happened anywhere else, I would have been fucked."
"3476720","3479740"," Probably could have gotten arrested for like, public, public drunkenness. "
"3480500","3482660"," Uh, anywhere else I would have been fucked."
"3483160","3489720"," So, I don't know what you guys are all talking about out there."
"3489980","3492600"," You guys should, you guys see that somebody's saying I don't lose money in calls. "
"3492920","3494100"," You guys see down here?"
"3494920","3497280"," Where does it say, uh, hold on a second."
"3497520","3498720"," Is this thing not, not flashing?"
"3501820","3503460"," Um, hold on a second."
"3505020","3505980"," One second here. "
"3506060","3506540"," I want to see what."
"3507720","3509220"," Let me read, hold on a second here."
"3510620","3511220"," Oh, yeah. "
"3511360","3512400"," What does this thing say down here?"
"3512640","3515720"," This broadcast is for entertainment purposes only."
"3515960","3517480"," Not financial advice."
"3517740","3519580"," And the crypto peer and greed index. "
"3521480","3522600"," Squeezing right now, baby."
"3522760","3523300"," Keep on squeezing."
"3524460","3524940"," So. "
"3525540","3534280"," Keep on squeezing."
"3534680","3535860"," Don't get that rejection candle."
"3537060","3540260"," Get all these fucking pulls entering tops and fucking selling bottoms. "
"3545620","3548520"," So that was my first, that was my first like bad experience in Vegas."
"3548820","3552700"," So every time I go, I never alone anymore late night, like never go anywhere alone."
"3553120","3557380"," Like anywhere from like one in the morning until six a.m. Never alone in Vegas. "
"3557920","3557940"," Rule."
"3558660","3559720"," Second rule of Vegas."
"3560240","3561000"," Three days is plenty. "
"3562200","3563220"," One day is usually not enough."
"3563700","3564480"," Three days is about right."
"3565180","3565460"," Five days. "
"3566380","3567680"," Start doing stupid shit."
"3568580","3570800"," Uh, second, or second time I went to Vegas."
"3571400","3577400"," I was sitting out in one of these pools and, um, I can't tell that story. "
"3578980","3581560"," Uh, I was, I can't tell that story."
"3581780","3583860"," Like in Vegas, you're going like Burning Man."
"3584720","3589240"," And, uh, I think we came back from Burning Man. "
"3589340","3590160"," We left Burning Man."
"3590980","3591940"," We went surfing."
"3593280","3597200"," And so after Burning Man went surfing, they cut across and hit Vegas in the way back. "
"3597760","3599620"," And people can tell who you are."
"3599940","3601760"," They're like, oh, that's a burner."
"3602280","3604500"," They're like, that guy over there wants to have some fun. "
"3605100","3612360"," So like you're sitting in a pool and there might be like, I don't know, 3,000, 5,000 people"
"3612360","3612940"," in the pool area."
"3613220","3616500"," So it seems like a thousand people or whatever in the pool area."
"3616500","3619740"," And people are like, they can tell they're like, that guy is from middle America. "
"3620220","3622220"," Like that guy over there likes to party."
"3622660","3623940"," So they'll find you."
"3623940","3625420"," People will be like that guy over there. "
"3625560","3626800"," We can have fun with that guy."
"3626920","3627380"," Him and his friends."
"3636800","3638280"," Oh man, Burning Man stories. "
"3639380","3640260"," Uh, I got some good ones."
"3643680","3644880"," So that's drama down here."
"3644960","3646360"," You guys all sitting in puts right now?"
"3647580","3649420"," You guys are, you guys are all sitting in puts. "
"3653320","3655740"," Still haven't closed this fucking gap down here though."
"3656180","3658100"," We're like, why are we leaving this one behind?"
"3665060","3665600"," We'll see."
"3665820","3666940"," We're going to find out right here. "
"3667120","3668100"," We're going to find out right here."
"3668200","3669740"," See this little tick right here?"
"3670360","3674840"," This one right here is going to tell us the story of what we're doing."
"3678930","3680390"," This one right here. "
"3681650","3682490"," Where am I cursor?"
"3682890","3683890"," Is this little bar right here?"
"3683950","3685370"," Is it going to tell us if we're going down or not?"
"3686730","3688150"," Start breaking above here."
"3689350","3690990"," Start catching a bar here."
"3690990","3691990"," Ten, this is green. "
"3693810","3696930"," Red maybe or green and then red and then there we go."
"3701820","3704380"," Still don't like this gap still left behind down here."
"3709990","3711390"," But so people come find you. "
"3711850","3715270"," And so you like, you look like a bird or you look like you just got back from the burn."
"3715910","3717390"," Uh, and then we're surfing shit."
"3717570","3720910"," So we got like, or I'll like, ten and get that laid back. "
"3721110","3724590"," And people just come find you and be like, they'll ask you some fun."
"3724730","3726390"," They'll ask you some really wax stuff, right?"
"3726390","3727650"," Hey, you want to go do this?"
"3728270","3729910"," You want to go, um, I don't know."
"3730050","3732590"," You want to come back and like bang my wife in a hotel or something?"
"3732690","3733690"," All kinds of wild shit. "
"3734390","3736230"," And I think you just attract it."
"3736570","3738270"," Cause the people are there to party."
"3738830","3740590"," Whatever their sense of partying is. "
"3750620","3752880"," Yeah, I'm doing well right now."
"3753020","3754180"," I'm doing, I'm doing good right now."
"3755620","3756400"," Doing good. "
"3760060","3761400"," So soft, so soft."
"3761680","3763160"," Dude salty bears, man."
"3763320","3763880"," Salty sellers. "
"3768510","3771290"," Want to see what the, what this interaction is right here."
"3772290","3774410"," Price needs to get above 440-28."
"3779980","3780560"," Gonna work. "
"3780740","3782300"," You know these sellers are here, right?"
"3782900","3784460"," Uh, we were talked about this on the open."
"3784760","3788140"," If you don't know that, uh, go back to the beginning of the broadcast this morning."
"3788760","3790020"," And I talked about it up here. "
"3790380","3791440"," These sellers are here."
"3792620","3794180"," Right up here is a big yellow box."
"3794420","3795140"," Let me show it to you again. "
"3795900","3797500"," Some of you, some of you are all out there."
"3798100","3799080"," Don't know this, so."
"3807300","3809400"," You're not going to break above easily. "
"3810180","3810880"," So let's look."
"3812960","3814380"," That's never easy, right?"
"3814800","3816480"," They don't just lift the sell button."
"3816840","3819080"," Uh, you've got a hedge sell side hedge funds. "
"3819600","3821040"," They're going to sell it every time."
"3823080","3825040"," So just where we are right here, right?"
"3825220","3825560"," You see it?"
"3828160","3829620"," Again, I'll go over one more time, right?"
"3830180","3832260"," So they sold this high right here, right?"
"3833920","3835140"," Sell this high, right?"
"3835200","3835820"," It sounded again."
"3837700","3838100"," Right?"
"3838500","3838920"," Sound it again. "
"3839200","3839480"," Do you remember?"
"3840480","3841160"," All this right here."
"3841720","3845760"," It's coming back down here into, uh, the beginning of the month, beginning of the quarter."
"3846600","3846620"," Right?"
"3846860","3847200"," Squeeze it up. "
"3848460","3850300"," They're going to sell this every time."
"3850660","3851440"," Not sometimes."
"3852540","3853500"," Sitting up here wanting to sell. "
"3854020","3855080"," I've got puts up here."
"3857400","3858880"," Monthly fucking puts up here."
"3859260","3861300"," They sold this reversal here, right?"
"3861500","3861820"," Whoop. "
"3862480","3865000"," On Friday, talked about go come back to close this gap."
"3865260","3865600"," They did it."
"3866060","3866600"," Close the gap. "
"3866900","3868180"," Came step right back in sellers."
"3868780","3871120"," And that's what they want to do until it doesn't work anymore."
"3871420","3873020"," They're going to do the same thing right here, right?"
"3873620","3875440"," Talked about this on the opening bell. "
"3875900","3877340"," So can we break up here?"
"3877480","3879280"," Yeah, because we got the green, right?"
"3880780","3881060"," Rolling up."
"3882960","3883380"," Right?"
"3883740","3884800"," Talked about this right on the opening bell."
"3884940","3885800"," It's not going to be easy. "
"3885800","3889560"," Now, if we break below, I'll get bearish again."
"3890160","3891080"," Buy some zero dates."
"3892300","3893660"," See the buyers are here. "
"3894140","3894400"," See them?"
"3896840","3897800"," They're right here."
"3898440","3898780"," See that?"
"3898820","3899520"," See that wick?"
"3900120","3901100"," See that wick?"
"3901740","3903800"," Means there's demand to the upside."
"3905900","3907160"," Sellers are weak here. "
"3907520","3908180"," They're weak here."
"3908500","3909140"," They're weak here."
"3909400","3910010"," They're weak here. "
"3912280","3915440"," And sell side, you'll start to squeeze them out, man."
"3915800","3920380"," You start to break above here."
"3922260","3923560"," You're going to run them over. "
"3924020","3927880"," Let's go straight up until we break below this green."
"3929180","3929840"," I'm long here."
"3930080","3930240"," Get it?"
"3932100","3933860"," I need to break below like this. "
"3936540","3940520"," I don't want to hear crying or all the whining."
"3942020","3945600"," We can always switch and buy some zero date puts below."
"3945600","3955400"," The closing bar below $4.39.73. Unless you get that closing bar below $4.90. $4.39 "
"3955400","3959640",".67. $4.39.73 or something like that. "
"3960720","3962380"," I'm not adding zero date puts."
"3962940","3966060"," This move down here are multi-day."
"3967880","3969300"," I guess it's right there. "
"3970640","3971800"," It's probably even higher now."
"3972020","3973180"," $4.35 and a half."
"3974060","3975160"," It's come down now. "
"3975780","3977940"," That's the best low they can expect right now."
"3978700","3985950"," This move right here is not showing itself."
"3986910","3988070"," So no puts. "
"3990530","3991230"," Calls to the upside."
"3996180","3996640"," And look at that."
"3997260","3997400"," Shocker. "
"4002080","4005420"," We'll see if we can get up here and get back up here and try to fight these sellers up"
"4005420","4005620"," here."
"4006320","4009540"," Roll over these sellers and start making a big move higher."
"4010300","4024310"," Yeah, I"
"4024310","4026050"," was wondering if people are going to Fred's because. "
"4028490","4031950"," So I asked to join blue sky."
"4032450","4034190"," Someone offered it to me months ago."
"4034730","4035450"," I didn't say anything. "
"4036230","4036570"," I just said."
"4038310","4042110"," I was like, I don't want to get stuck with threat with blue sky."
"4042150","4048230"," I didn't want to get stuck in a room with only people that agreed with me. "
"4048230","4049670"," It's kind of weird."
"4051190","4054490"," I was trying to explain this on Twitter the other day."
"4055430","4058790"," There's like a sweet spot in social media. "
"4060310","4067410"," There was that time in 2013 where some pranksters were showing Twitter threads with a hashtag."
"4068110","4070090"," This tech company at a conference."
"4072850","4074510"," And they were able to. "
"4076230","4079550"," They figured out that they were that they had these big screens up at this conference."
"4079890","4084410"," And if you use the specific hashtag, it would be piped in on a scroll."
"4084890","4086510"," And so people are having fun with it. "
"4086690","4093790"," They were making all kinds of sexist, racist or devolved, of course, into like 14 year old kids."
"4094710","4095569"," That like stupid words."
"4096310","4097750"," So there's like a time. "
"4097910","4099830"," Number one, there was a time on the internet where."
"4101850","4104450"," Some of this stuff wasn't intentional."
"4105550","4106029"," It was more. "
"4106529","4107050"," It wasn't."
"4107350","4109250"," It didn't become crazy intentional."
"4110410","4119529"," But then as the as the as the internet has become older in age, it has done real damage. "
"4121890","4125670"," Trying to be like trying to like pull one over."
"4125930","4130430"," Like you're a kid trying to screw over like a tech company that takes themselves too seriously."
"4130870","4132569"," Don't understand the tech that they're using. "
"4133170","4134210"," But there's that, right?"
"4134630","4143010"," But then over the years, some of this stuff has turned into really gross stuff, right?"
"4143350","4144310"," Really disgusting stuff."
"4144590","4146069"," And some people drink this shit."
"4146529","4147210"," It's like Kool-Aid. "
"4148010","4151130"," It's like, it's like, oh, you know, I want to be a racist."
"4151630","4152350"," I want to be a bigot."
"4152510","4155689"," I want to be a this or that or this is real. "
"4156490","4160130"," And some of it's pushed by real true bad people."
"4160450","4164830"," And some of it's pushed by governments as well from other countries."
"4165069","4171229"," They want to turn you into something you might not be or make something okay or that monster or"
"4171229","4176210"," someone that has mental health issues has a platform, has a soapbox. "
"4176210","4179729"," And you don't just walk by them in a park and say, I'm not listening to that crazy person."
"4180109","4181750"," It's actually in your air all day long."
"4182029","4183250"," And that's one of the problems, right?"
"4183569","4184310"," So you get on Twitter. "
"4185810","4188930"," And these days, and on Reddit, well, on Reddit, it's not like that anymore."
"4189090","4190470"," And it's just very astrotroph now."
"4191210","4194070"," But there were like, people want that, right?"
"4194230","4194690"," They want that. "
"4195150","4202090"," They want that like, they want that people that are older, even if you're younger, as platforms"
"4202090","4202550"," change."
"4202550","4206870"," There's usually a golden age of a social media platform."
"4207850","4212790"," And a lot of social media right now is trying to, I don't know why, but put you in a"
"4212790","4215010"," box of people that believe in what you believe in. "
"4215390","4216610"," So you're only hearing their voice."
"4217570","4222510"," You want to hear every side of the arguments, but you don't want to hear the crazy people either,"
"4222510","4222910"," right?"
"4223150","4225110"," You want like, and you can't have that."
"4225230","4230990"," You can actually on social media have there are some sweet spots in social media where that is"
"4230990","4231230"," possible. "
"4231230","4234470"," So we're watching right now to see these sellers have come down."
"4234790","4236190"," They started above right here."
"4237810","4239730"," And they're going to try one more time right here. "
"4239790","4241030"," If you're in calls, you're trying to get out."
"4241370","4242550"," It's kind of the place for you."
"4242770","4243330"," I'm in calls. "
"4243610","4244210"," I'm long here."
"4244950","4250750"," I'm not willing to sell until we actually confirmed to the downside underneath the hourly trigger."
"4251550","4254070"," And we get a roll of that, uh, 27 EMA. "
"4255570","4256890"," Velocity is telling me we're going up."
"4257070","4259690"," So I'm believing in that velocity unless I'm told otherwise."
"4260810","4265570"," Now, uh, so blue sky is kind of the same way. "
"4265790","4272070"," It's kind of like, uh, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to like force Astro Turf."
"4274730","4275690"," Um, who's there?"
"4275930","4276510"," Who can't be there?"
"4276610","4277230"," What can be said?"
"4277330","4277870"," What can't be said?"
"4278410","4284610"," I don't want to hear, uh, some of the nastiness that I see on Twitter specifically."
"4285110","4291830"," Uh, but at the same time, I do want like, um, some, some more openness still, right?"
"4292450","4295890"," Um, I don't know. "
"4296050","4297710"," It's hard thing to navigate to even discuss."
"4298270","4306050"," Um, now threads, but I've been making accounts across these places because I'm like, all right, if"
"4306050","4308050"," there is a mass migration, where is it to?"
"4308630","4310370"," You want to be there when there is a mass migration."
"4310930","4320790"," Now, threads, uh, Twitter is experiencing less, um, less, um, user"
"4320790","4322450"," usage in the past week, right?"
"4322890","4326230"," I think they're down 12% or 11% last time I checked. "
"4326710","4330190"," It was like 3% and 5% then someone else said it was 11%."
"4332250","4334210"," That big old supply up there."
"4334530","4335190"," Whoa, doggy. "
"4335910","4337530"," Give me on up there and break through."
"4337530","4347310"," Um, threads, I have, I almost joined it the other day, uh, but they don't have a"
"4347310","4347690"," desktop."
"4349490","4356010"," I see, well, they have 400 million or 400 million users in the past week or two. "
"4356210","4357070"," That's not insignificant."
"4358050","4359470"," I think tell me how I'm wrong on this."
"4359970","4364330"," Twitter's daily or monthly user base is like 400 million. "
"4365250","4367410"," Don't call me on that, but I think that's what it is."
"4367410","4372150"," Um, basing this upon stuff that I've read that I don't have, I've pulled up on a screener."
"4372570","4374290"," But like 100 million uses pretty sick. "
"4374390","4376250"," It is significant for threads."
"4376730","4381690"," For me, I don't use, uh, social media on my phone frequently."
"4382110","4383530"," I do, but not frequently. "
"4384590","4388170"," Uh, you, if you know me out there, I fucking hate phones."
"4388890","4396050"," Uh, I spend so much time streaming that, uh, I use social media on a desktop or on a laptop."
"4396710","4398110"," I like having a laptop. "
"4398470","4400290"," I like using social media on a laptop."
"4400530","4403350"," Threads not offering that yet is a problem for me."
"4403850","4406790"," Uh, I don't spend my time attached to my phone. "
"4407390","4412190"," Matter of fact, I went out with Winky, um, to, in Ohio, right?"
"4412370","4416550"," So I went out and saw Winky in Ohio and phone was down for me."
"4416970","4419310"," Like, phone in my pocket took some pictures."
"4419990","4422810"," Uh, but I don't have, I'm not answering calls all day long. "
"4422890","4424050"," I'm not talking to my friends."
"4424050","4425450"," I want to talk to them."
"4425650","4429130"," I just, I try to live in the moment, uh, with what I'm doing. "
"4430130","4430930"," I'm that person."
"4431750","4435790"," Uh, I put my phone away and if you, you and I are doing something, we're going surfing."
"4436570","4437350"," Uh, we're going dancing. "
"4437970","4438610"," We're going hiking."
"4439490","4441430"," Uh, we're going to, to steer a boat."
"4441670","4442870"," We're going to go snorkeling. "
"4443130","4444130"," We're going to go do that stuff."
"4444630","4445830"," I don't have my phone on me."
"4446370","4447610"," Uh, matter of fact, I have a dry bag. "
"4448250","4452150"," I just went, did some kayaking and, uh, I have dry bags and put my shit in there."
"4452150","4455290"," And I don't open that dry bag sucked to open and close."
"4455890","4460750"," Uh, so goes in the dry bag, attached to the kayak, and I'm done with it, right?"
"4461990","4463890"," Uh, I know that that's not the case for everybody. "
"4464150","4467270"," My kids are like, my kids are like fucking phone attached to the hips."
"4468010","4471110"," Uh, kind of an adult to like that too."
"4471210","4472170"," I have friends that are like that too. "
"4472270","4474250"," It's like phone everywhere, phone for this, phone for that."
"4474970","4481130"," Um, but for me, for threads, uh, until they have a desktop app, I, I'm not even open to using"
"4481130","4481390"," it."
"4481390","4485810"," And it's not like it's being replaced by someone any better than Elon. "
"4486570","4490310"," Um, these sellers just aren't quitting here."
"4491710","4492330"," Ugh."
"4493490","4494930"," I'm so boring. "
"4499590","4500910"," Ugh, so much drama."
"4501350","4503410"," I feel like bears are so emotional and drama-filled."
"4507150","4508630"," So much drama. "
"4508830","4510190"," It's like, it's like a teenage girl."
"4510190","4511990"," I was like, bears like teenage girls."
"4513690","4515050"," Just revenge selling. "
"4515770","4517590"," Like sell, sell, sell, sell."
"4520050","4526330"," So, at any rate, um, for me to use threads, I still haven't signed up."
"4526330","4531430"," I was going to sign up and haven't signed up because I don't really have a use for it on"
"4531430","4531910"," my phone. "
"4532090","4536190"," I'm not going to check threads on my phone all day long."
"4536190","4541070"," I use my phone right now to get text messages from people that produce this show."
"4542090","4544570"," But I don't use my phone generally. "
"4545070","4546370"," I like big text, big phone call."
"4547070","4548670"," And I don't do any work off of it."
"4548930","4549810"," Sometimes I'll post it to Twitter. "
"4550610","4551410"," Um, but that's about it."
"4551590","4552490"," So as far as it goes."
"4552930","4555590"," In fact, I just bought a new phone and it's not working. "
"4556510","4557790"," Uh, so whatever."
"4558150","4559370"," I couldn't pour it into it or something."
"4561290","4562950"," I break phones all the time. "
"4563090","4564530"," I drive over them."
"4564530","4565710"," I lose them."
"4565910","4566550"," I smash them. "
"4566730","4568090"," I drop them in water."
"4568830","4570110"," So I'm just not a phone user."
"4571250","4572610"," Come on, bulls. "
"4573710","4574770"," Run them over."
"4576050","4580090"," So, uh, threads for me haven't joined."
"4580530","4581410"," They are a threat. "
"4581710","4582810"," I don't know why they're a threat."
"4584610","4588370"," Usually, uh, these mass migrations have to be organic."
"4588770","4590250"," They usually are organic. "
"4590750","4591390"," They're not planned."
"4591390","4595810"," And they, I'm shocked that it would be on Facebook."
"4597230","4601810"," And with Zuckerberg, like Zuck's not like that's this guy's he's he's not good. "
"4602770","4608270"," Um, he's like, you know, he's not he's."
"4608710","4613630"," Whatever that turns into is going to eventually you'll leave again."
"4613830","4618150"," I think he's not really good at, uh, like he traps you with. "
"4618270","4620850"," You remember when Facebook first came on?"
"4620850","4623030"," It was like early adopters."
"4623370","4624150"," Then it was explosive."
"4624630","4626750"," And then your mom was there and you're like, give me the fuck out of here. "
"4627490","4629150"," Uh, you know, your grandma got on there."
"4629210","4630170"," Your aunt's got on there."
"4630230","4632410"," You've got pictures of you doing shit. "
"4632530","4633170"," You shouldn't be doing."
"4633610","4635530"," And they're like, Oh, Lord Jesus."
"4635810","4637670"," What's what's, uh, what's Captain Jim doing?"
"4638730","4641850"," You know, why is he running around shirt cocking in the desert?"
"4642890","4644330"," Why is he porky pig in it?"
"4644930","4647150"," You know, so that it's a weird thing with it. "
"4647150","4651930"," Like these things are like the tastemakers, the zeit gas guests, all that stuff."
"4652390","4654550"," I don't know that threads is that place either."
"4655350","4660150"," It's normally or it's normally unexpectedly like, wow, that thing took off. "
"4660370","4666610"," And the people that are running it normally aren't, uh, aren't like trying to create the zeit gas"
"4666610","4667610"," with a bunch of money."
"4668250","4668950"," They're usually young."
"4669210","4673030"," I'm looking for someone young to do this like group of kids that said, fuck it. "
"4673110","4674250"," We're not going in the tech pipeline."
"4674510","4676050"," We're going to create around social media site."
"4676830","4682470"," The only other thing I think of is possibly discord being that that they have some kind. "
"4682690","4683290"," They're still private."
"4683570","4688710"," They still have some kind of not credibility with the original users of discord, but they do"
"4688710","4690050"," generally have good credibility."
"4690610","4692790"," Some I still don't think threads is the place. "
"4693410","4698750"," Maybe threads is the place for regular people, normals, normies."
"4698950","4699270"," I don't know."
"4701670","4702150"," Yeah. "
"4702150","4703890"," We got cap confirmed boomer baby."
"4704110","4704450"," Whoo."
"4708770","4712210"," Yeah, there are companies doing a metaverse better, right?"
"4712410","4719110"," We already know that there are companies out of China that have way, way, way better VR worlds that"
"4719110","4721110"," have been worked on for many years, right?"
"4721650","4726570"," And a lot of those worlds, those virtual worlds were organic. "
"4726970","4733670"," They were organically made from when no one was there and they're better than matter."
"4733770","4735290"," When you start trying to, when you try to like."
"4736590","4738510"," I used to go to these, like you got to touch you guys. "
"4738630","4739570"," I used to go to raves, right?"
"4740070","4743970"," And you go to like parties in L downtown LA, New York, right?"
"4745750","4747710"," Boston, Philadelphia, Rhode Island, right?"
"4747870","4752570"," You go to these things and people would find you and be like, Hey, man, I'm a."
"4753290","4756590"," You'd like, like people would find you and be like, can I take a picture?"
"4756790","4757490"," Can I interview you?"
"4758210","4759330"," Why do you wear these clothes?"
"4759830","4760970"," Why do you look like this?"
"4761190","4761710"," Why are you at the show?"
"4762010","4762410"," How old are you?"
"4762510","4763230"," What are you even doing here?"
"4764170","4765110"," All that stuff, right?"
"4765230","4767970"," And these are people that are trying to find out what trends are."
"4769610","4771510"," There's not as much of that today."
"4771650","4777310"," So these people would be hired by companies and they would say, Hey, we've found all these people"
"4777310","4778570"," and they seem to be. "
"4778570","4785770"," I don't know, not hipsters, but just like they're they're doing their own thing and they're"
"4785770","4789750"," creating what we're going to now feed to normal people."
"4790610","4792170"," Today, it's not like that."
"4792310","4796650"," Say people that say these companies and these oligarchs like we're going to create this. "
"4797250","4802630"," We're going to say this is cool and this is style and they're going to eat it."
"4804090","4806030"," And that wasn't always the case."
"4806970","4814170"," So there's a real shift paradigm shift in trying to create what's cool or force. "
"4814410","4817410"," Wow, look at that big green fucking ball right there."
"4818350","4819410"," Oh, yeah."
"4820290","4833950"," Oh, yeah. "
"4834590","4836650"," Oh, that doesn't make this."
"4836830","4841270"," This is not this is not making a seller happy right there."
"4866260","4867900"," Sellers are not happy right now. "
"4870760","4872260"," This is what a seller wanted."
"4875080","4880700"," So I wanted to take this down down here and this red bar they wanted."
"4883380","4889220"," They wanted that one right there and then they wanted like green up here. "
"4890060","4891560"," They wanted this to roll down."
"4892420","4893740"," They wanted this one right here."
"4894760","4896000"," See that right there?"
"4896600","4899600"," You know, that's telling you that's fucking telling you buyers are here. "
"4900940","4903220"," And these fucking buyers will buy it all."
"4905720","4907840"," So I guess they were wrong."
"4910160","4912620"," So I don't know. "
"4912800","4913120"," I don't know."
"4913120","4913180"," I don't know."
"4913280","4913820"," Threads is it. "
"4914080","4915460"," Do you guys think threads is it?"
"4915700","4916380"," It might be."
"4916700","4919420"," It might be for every like the everybody crowd."
"4919820","4925020"," When I see like the hundred million users or they expect 400 million or 300 million in the next few"
"4925020","4926700"," days, I'm like, yeah, I can see. "
"4927560","4932700"," Like normal people making that migration to threads."
"4933080","4938780"," I can see people wanting and the other fascinating thing is how many people use it on their phones."
"4939100","4939840"," Like my phone. "
"4939980","4940780"," I'm going to use it on my phone."
"4940940","4941560"," It's awesome."
"4945160","4947980"," You know, it's like all that data available to people. "
"4948520","4949700"," Can you scrape threads?"
"4949980","4950920"," I don't know if you can or can't."
"4951620","4952300"," That's open source."
"4957510","4958270"," Threads is done. "
"4965080","4969640"," So I'm a wiki saying something I like when we say somebody said that is how the iPod iPhone became"
"4969640","4969940"," a thing."
"4970060","4971220"," It's not a good product for people."
"4971340","4974360"," I saw us and cut you using it on two and a half men or whatever. "
"4974480","4975260"," And that was all it took."
"4975480","4975600"," Yeah."
"4975940","4977240"," Yeah, when he's making a good point here. "
"4979380","4981160"," I'm not I'm not anti this side."
"4981160","4981840"," Like I'm not anti."
"4984380","4985220"," Threads being a thing. "
"4985400","4986280"," I think it's for the masses."
"4987260","4989320"," But usually like when you have a mass migration."
"4989760","4995180"," It's usually like a small group of people using a site or an app. "
"4996240","4998640"," And it grows organically."
"4998980","5000700"," And then the masses come, right?"
"5003000","5004620"," This isn't happening like that."
"5004620","5004960"," Is it?"
"5005220","5012120"," This isn't that thing where you have a cool thing and word starts to leak out over time years pass"
"5012120","5013160"," and then boom. "
"5013320","5014780"," It explodes to the public."
"5015420","5016660"," Threads isn't like that, right?"
"5018500","5020160"," There's none of that with threads at all."
"5020300","5029100"," Uh, poke juice box thing and I want my IG friends meeting my Twitter friends. "
"5030060","5032480"," Yeah, I don't know if Twitter is still it or not."

"5300530","5303810"," I don't like that they don't tell young people. "
"5305750","5307010"," The secret sauce."
"5307530","5308570"," They just yell at them."
"5308570","5310990"," Like, why are boomers yelling at young people?"
"5312910","5314250"," Without talking to them. "
"5314510","5320530"," That pisses me off."
"5321570","5323650"," Sellers going back to last major high."
"5323850","5325070"," That's that yellow box up here. "
"5325350","5326870"," There's my PT one right here."
"5328350","5330170"," Need to grind up and over."
"5330590","5333910"," If we're able to grind up and over, you can see the sellers step in right here. "
"5335430","5336990"," If we can get above."
"5337690","5341870"," Squeeze up and expecting some kind of a consolidation down here."
"5341870","5342450"," A breather. "
"5342850","5346670"," Maybe they hold us off into a CPR report."
"5351530","5352550"," I was surprised."
"5353010","5353830"," I was surprised. "
"5354810","5357410"," So like my wife is still on Facebook, right?"
"5358130","5359570"," And she only does it for the family thing."
"5360310","5365490"," I was surprised like I've got friends on there from my childhood and they've been active on"
"5365490","5367090"," Facebook throughout."
"5368190","5370390"," Like they have active profiles on Facebook. "
"5370650","5371450"," That's what they use."
"5372630","5375090"," But I get the points about Twitter being a shithole."
"5375630","5380510"," I understand that like Twitter like Twitter can be a very like. "
"5382590","5387670"," The algorithms intentionally are so we have a friend of the show here who."
"5389650","5392730"," Creates Twitter personas."
"5393510","5396870"," And tests the YouTube algorithms. "
"5398010","5398530"," And."
"5399870","5401970"," The nastier you are."
"5403070","5405610"," The more contrarian that you are. "
"5406270","5408410"," The more traction that you get."
"5408910","5412610"," And so he's he's trying to find out what the full algorithm is."
"5413090","5415910"," And the background on Twitter and somebody does is. "
"5417210","5417690"," Atrocious."
"5418010","5423070"," They wouldn't want to be if you didn't know what he was doing, which a lot of people don't."
"5423710","5425210"," They think he's that monster. "
"5426310","5427670"," But he's not that monster."
"5427830","5430390"," He's trying to he's a very smart guy."
"5430750","5433990"," And he's trying to find out what makes Twitter work. "
"5434270","5436990"," And you know Twitter Twitter's algorithm is built."
"5437550","5438670"," I don't know if you know that or not."
"5438730","5441810"," It's built for you to be contrarian. "
"5442570","5444690"," Say things that are untrue."
"5445530","5449870"," Say things that will make people angry tug in their emotions."
"5451090","5451990"," In theory. "
"5452250","5453830"," So when you see people say I left Twitter."
"5454630","5456510"," It's built to piss you off."
"5457130","5459690"," So they're thought processes. "
"5460310","5461690"," It's going to get you to interact more."
"5462630","5464270"," And you might be like, well, it didn't."
"5464330","5464590"," I left. "
"5465270","5466950"," It is built though too."
"5467590","5468930"," It might not attract you to do that."
"5468930","5473130"," It attracts the other like 70 or 80 people out of a hundred to do that. "
"5474390","5479350"," And it kind of rage posts get pissed off all that kind of stuff on Twitter."
"5479470","5481470"," It was like a fascinating place when it comes to that stuff."
"5482130","5487190"," But of course in the same in the same token, some people believe that stuff, right?"
"5487630","5491450"," That's when you leave that golden hour in a social media site. "
"5491990","5496870"," And you actually start to create these monsters and you start to attract actual crazy people."
"5497450","5498270"," People that are crazy."
"5499150","5502750"," And you know, they have fascinations with really weird shit, bad shit. "
"5503250","5504370"," And it becomes a movement."
"5504830","5508350"," And then you get your track governments to do that stuff as well to Astro Turf."
"5508870","5510210"," Try to cause division, that kind of stuff. "
"5516490","5521510"," Yeah, if you if if if I were to post this up, there's a bunch of stuff I could post."
"5522170","5523730"," I probably get a million followers."
"5524450","5527650"," But I don't like can't do it. "
"5530050","5535650"," There's some real nasty shit you can post and get mass followings on Fintuit."
"5536370","5539790"," I think I've know I could be wrong here, but I think I've noticed."
"5540350","5543770"," I have been on Fintuit, but I haven't been posting. "
"5544250","5547390"," But I've been fascinated to see who's posting on Fintuit."
"5547790","5550950"," And I see less and less people posting on Fintuit."
"5550950","5552850"," Does anybody notice that at all?"
"5553710","5559790"," Lower engagements on Fintuit or lower less people posting on Fintuit?"
"5561370","5562870"," Does anyone notice that at all?"
"5563110","5563710"," I noticed it. "
"5564670","5569610"," I've been I've been paying attention to it quietly in the background to see if there's any like"
"5569610","5572450"," migration or any kind of lower engagement."
"5572870","5574050"," I don't know if everyone's just on vacation."
"5574970","5576110"," That could be possible as well. "
"5576290","5576650"," Wait a minute here."
"5583660","5586740"," These sellers are going to get this is going to be explosive, man."
"5586960","5589060"," Going to be nasty. "
"5590020","5591620"," It's going to be nasty."
"5595380","5596660"," Is Fintuit very quiet?"
"5597420","5597580"," Yeah."
"5597760","5597960"," Okay. "
"5598080","5598920"," I noticed it too."
"5600040","5600760"," I noticed it."
"5600960","5604740"," So I'm not the only one out there noticing that there's less content, less engagement. "
"5605240","5607080"," Are you guys noticing Fintuit's quiet right now?"
"5607800","5608280"," Yeah."
"5610480","5613100"," You highly reduce the number of Fintuit as you follow right on."
"5613580","5618060"," I just noticed that my feed is not as active as it once was. "
"5624130","5626010"," You're saying that half it's Chinese bots."
"5631150","5631950"," Yeah, let go."
"5632070","5636630"," I've actually had some good experiences on let go. "
"5637710","5642790"," Sometimes it's passed over by but I like about let go as if somebody's a dedicated let go user."
"5644190","5646470"," They don't post anywhere else."
"5647670","5653350"," I had great experience finding like a seller or a seller on let go. "
"5653770","5655270"," It doesn't have any exposure anywhere else."
"5655810","5657630"," I'm finding some sweet stuff to buy."
"5659090","5660970"," And there were usually real sellers too. "
"5662230","5663390"," I had good experience there."
"5674870","5676110"," So you don't notice."
"5677530","5678670"," Notifications are disabled. "
"5681350","5682990"," You think a lot of people are broke."
"5683270","5684070"," I don't think so."
"5686270","5686730"," Maybe. "
"5686950","5687210"," I don't know."
"5687470","5687890"," Maybe."
"5688190","5690950"," I don't know if that was a first time chat from Craig. "
"5691830","5692730"," Phil Genzi."
"5692910","5693990"," I don't know if they're broke then."
"5694990","5695450"," Maybe. "
"5698010","5701970"," I don't know if people just not using social media or if they're not."
"5702230","5703070"," Maybe they're blocking me."
"5703130","5704210"," Maybe they're muting me or something. "
"5704870","5706670"," I don't know."
"5707170","5708730"," Let me see if I can find this real quick."
"5709670","5710350"," What did I see?"
"5710650","5711670"," Who's I saw this?"
"5713190","5717690"," I didn't know that Will Alerts is following me or something. "

"5778820","5782160"," What is a good website to set up a custodial account?"
"5784340","5785400"," That's a good question. "
"5785920","5790760"," Joe Harper has, my wife has something for my kids."

"5966810","5969250"," I can't comment on that stuff publicly anymore."
"5969290","5971510"," I used to be able to count anymore, but I get what you're saying."
"5977800","5979480"," Yeah, I agree with that too, TF Times. "
"5983280","5986560"," Hey, Chaz is saying that Stash app has an amazing custodial account."
"5986780","5989360"," It helps to teach about ETFs and fundamentals and companies."
"5990300","5993100"," Let me ask Joe if he knows the name of this company. "
"5993100","5993500"," Hold on."
"5993640","5994840"," My wife, dude, I gave it to my wife."
"5995400","5996180"," She does it with my kids. "
"5996720","5997500"," Hold on a second here."
"6004150","6004790"," Best custodial."
"6016320","6017220"," God, squeeze him. "
"6020720","6021480"," Hey, Matt, Phillips."
"6021660","6022000"," I do him, brother."
"6023020","6024240"," You want to do a bottle for you, brother?"
"6024700","6025340"," I'll do that for you. "
"6026500","6029380"," TF Times standing at a 30-day ban on for calling someone a potato."
"6029380","6030860"," Threads won't replace Twitter in my opinion."
"6030860","6031220"," I agree. "
"6031700","6032740"," I agree with that too."
"6032840","6033680"," I've heard that same thing."
"6035000","6038220"," It's a very safe place. "
"6040460","6042820"," Matthew Phillips, let's do Baba for you, my brother."
"6043360","6044340"," Good to see you in the stream, man."
"6045100","6049300"," We're going to fucking explode here, so get ready to get your faces ripped off again. "
"6052800","6053740"," Let's look at Baba."
"6055720","6057060"," Did you guys sell your calls?"
"6057120","6058480"," Did you guys panic in selling calls?"
"6062030","6062650"," Oh, man."
"6062890","6063370"," Baba, dude. "
"6063930","6064410"," Looks great."
"6065270","6066970"," I still like Baba here."
"6068030","6069850"," I still have price targets to the upside too. "
"6069990","6070350"," Hold on here."
"6070530","6071470"," I'll bring up Baba for you."
"6072970","6073570"," That's right. "
"6082010","6084430"," My upside targets on Baba right now."
"6084710","6085870"," You can see them right here, Matt."
"6085870","6087210"," I've got 92. "
"6087210","6088850"," We tagged it."
"6090270","6096190"," 98.39. This yellow box up here, I'd like to see the 100 get tagged."
"6097390","6100090"," And then a roll over some kind right up here. "
"6100450","6100470"," Boom."
"6102370","6109990"," And then we'll start trying to make new highs up to 107.91. 111.99. And then the big bad"
"6109990","6114790"," boy up here to 117.72. I'd like to see this get tagged."
"6115530","6117250"," I want to tell you something. "
"6120630","6124370"," If you want a place to re-enter Baba, I love Baba here, man."
"6125130","6126850"," You're buying all these dips down here."
"6126890","6127730"," You just keep holding them. "
"6128610","6131210"," We are above weekly right now, so I'm going to delete all this crap."
"6133610","6136570"," Just so you can see it, we are above the weekly."
"6136930","6137730"," That's very bullish. "
"6138510","6139790"," Daily is coming up."
"6139890","6143510"," You're getting yourself a one, two, three, four, five trigger."
"6145730","6147430"," Five trigger bullish crosshair. "
"6147850","6148470"," Two go higher."
"6148830","6149670"," Just stay long and strong."
"6150310","6153130"," You're trying to tag about 119 or not 119. "
"6154270","6158810"," See monthly 115 is the target on Baba."
"6159430","6160530"," I like Baba a lot, man."
"6161150","6168750"," The cool part about Baba, Matt, is they're likely going to have a bad next year. "
"6170090","6174250"," So likely they're going to bring price up for that to happen."
"6174390","6177230"," What I would say to you would be stay away from Baba after."
"6182550","6194490"," Not after 119, but this is more"
"6194490","6195570"," time sensitive. "
"6196010","6198690"," The target is 119 for me."
"6199210","6203690"," I'd really like to see it go as high as 205, 200."
"6203870","6204630"," Let's call it 200. "
"6206170","6210490"," I don't know if it's going to get all the way back up and retest the 299 or not."
"6211230","6213450"," Time will matter with Baba."
"6216150","6217230"," Can you get 299?"
"6217890","6218090"," Yes. "
"6218550","6221230"," If it's before next year?"
"6221530","6222050"," Yes, you can."
"6223290","6225070"," So can you get 299 Baba?"
"6225170","6225670"," Yes, you can."
"6226550","6227430"," Time matters. "
"6229830","6230390"," What's this?"
"6230550","6231690"," What's happening with Spy right now?"
"6233170","6233790"," Oh, dude."
"6233970","6235710"," Spy burned into the depths of hell right now."
"6237450","6239170"," Just sold my calls, dude. "
"6239350","6240750"," Shouldn't have been buying calls down there."
"6241950","6243310"," Definitely shouldn't have been buying calls."
"6261780","6264260"," So I am very bullish, brother. "
"6264400","6268720"," Matt Phillips, I'm super bullish on Baba, but it's time dependent."
"6270460","6273520"," Not only is it time dependent, it's time dependent."
"6275260","6278220"," It's going to matter what happens in China next year. "
"6281220","6283520"," China, dude, I'm going to tell you right now."
"6284540","6294540"," By next year, right, if there's any more stink going on between China and the U.S. or"
"6294540","6298160"," if that escalates or anything at any point, that whole run is done and over."
"6299460","6307420"," Their economy depends upon their relationship with the United States of America. "
"6309540","6312160"," Though I do think they're in a great place right now."
"6312240","6313920"," Chinese economy is a great place right now."
"6316120","6321720"," So I think it would be like time dependent and dependent upon relations with the U.S. The U.S."
"6321720","6323000"," is gearing up to fight China. "
"6324480","6326780"," They want to be able to fight China by 2027."
"6328080","6329940"," And this is no fucking around."
"6330260","6334800"," This is like structural changes to the U.S. military. "
"6335960","6337520"," This is the same thing as going."
"6338240","6343320"," This is the same kind of buildup for the Cold War, same kind of buildup from World War II."
"6344120","6345880"," The U.S. does not fuck around. "
"6348880","6350240"," May not believe this."
"6350800","6352880"," The U.S. does not fuck around."
"6353280","6356060"," The U.S. learned their lesson in World War II. "
"6357160","6358860"," That'll never happen again."
"6359240","6361100"," Our military doctrine is not based upon that."
"6361500","6363380"," We gear up to fucking fight. "
"6365460","6367580"," We will be that guy in the corner."
"6370180","6373220"," So that's my only issue there is time."
"6373800","6375920"," And does China back down or not?"
"6377120","6378640"," Or do we actually fight them?"
"6380560","6383140"," But we're gearing up to have that fight. "
"6384120","6385400"," We don't fuck around."
"6385620","6387720"," There's a massive change."
"6387980","6395960"," The internal changes that are taking place in our military right now are no doctrine changes. "
"6396660","6401020"," We're going right back to our World War II type doctrine."
"6401020","6403400"," The regimental command type structure."
"6403680","6404560"," No more coins yet. "
"6404960","6406240"," I don't know if you're a military person out there."
"6406540","6407900"," The coin is out the fucking window."
"6412740","6414960"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright. "
"6415540","6419820"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forex and stock instruments."
"6420760","6421560"," Get a free trial."
"6421880","6422320"," Yeah, absolutely. "
"6423640","6426280"," U.S. is willing to risk World War III for hegemony."
"6426740","6426860"," Absolutely."
"6427800","6429800"," Right or wrong whether you like it or not. "
"6429800","6434840"," What the reality is is a lot different than what you wish and hope would happen."
"6434920","6436800"," And that's not what the U.S. does anymore."
"6437420","6438360"," Those days are over. "
"6438880","6441260"," They were over during Pearl Harbor."
"6444020","6447360"," And we have structural internal changes in our U.S. military right now."
"6447820","6449760"," We have massive money being poured. "
"6449920","6454520"," We're doing our own belts and roads like Palau and places like that."
"6454840","6457620"," All these chain islands, Mariana Islands."
"6458920","6460880"," We're not doing it in Africa like we should have done. "
"6461180","6465680"," But we are doing it in this chain of islands outside of the South China Sea."
"6466360","6466980"," We're improving."
"6467140","6468400"," Look at these sellers, man. "
"6468520","6470160"," These guys are doing me here."
"6473380","6478820"," I feel like there's like a bunch of monkeys up here throwing shit down."
"6482020","6483500"," It's kind of hilarious to watch. "
"6484280","6485740"," I don't know why they're doing it."
"6485740","6486640"," They're going to get run over."
"6486800","6487500"," They're not going to win this. "
"6487760","6488880"," I don't think they're going to win it."
"6494800","6497400"," It's just like a bunch of monkeys just throwing shit down."
"6497580","6498340"," Like die, bull. "
"6498600","6498760"," Die."
"6511830","6515090"," You know, if the U.S. starts World War III, it'll perish."
"6515430","6515950"," I doubt that. "
"6515950","6523770"," I don't think, like I was trying to explain this once before, like the U.S. is we should not"
"6523770","6526370"," be looking at the U.S. as a superpower anymore."
"6527050","6527950"," They're hyper power."
"6528250","6534650"," They're like, you can't compare China to U.S. You can't compare Russia to the United States. "
"6536610","6539730"," I don't even think that Russia has operational nukes."
"6539910","6540630"," I'll be honest with you."
"6541110","6541950"," Not only that. "
"6543830","6553530"," So Russia keeps a bunch of anti-or defense systems"
"6553530","6555710"," on their launch tubes on land."
"6556050","6562810"," I know they have subs and stuff, but a lot of the tech that the U.S. has is unknown."
"6563650","6567370"," It's known quietly, but it's unknown to the general public. "
"6567370","6572830"," And then the cost to maintain this stuff is exorbitant."
"6574330","6578930"," You see how Russia has performed in Ukraine."
"6581570","6587850"," You see it as a citizen of the U.S. You see it more glaring when you travel a lot"
"6587850","6590830"," at the hegemony of the United States of America. "
"6591310","6592570"," It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong."
"6593170","6599630"," The scale at which or what the U.S. is capable of with that kind of stuff is mind blowing."
"6600590","6602430"," We kind of suck at some things, right?"
"6602570","6612570"," We suck at that suck, but even the fighting in the Middle East, there's"
"6612570","6613610"," an intent behind it. "
"6614150","6617510"," Sometimes I'll hear veterans talk about we lost this war."
"6617690","6619010"," We lost that war, that kind of stuff."
"6619010","6628970"," You have to think about the very smart people that plan our hegemony as the U.S. And some of"
"6628970","6631350"," those wars are not intended to win. "
"6632170","6635850"," They're built for us to be there, but not to actually win."
"6636510","6638090"," We need a bad guy and we need presence."
"6638550","6639810"," We need oils and acronym, right?"
"6640810","6642910"," Whether you like this or not, I agree with it or not. "
"6643250","6644330"," I'm not here to debate that."
"6644590","6645610"," I get those arguments."
"6646450","6655090"," But the truth about the power of the U.S. under certain circumstances is mind blowing. "
"6656630","6657630"," Absolutely mind blowing."
"6657770","6662230"," I don't think there's another hyper power out there that is even close to matching the United"
"6662230","6662590"," States."
"6663370","6666290"," If you travel a lot, you can see it. "
"6666490","6667950"," If you sail, you can see it."
"6668750","6676650"," If you don't spend time in just tourist attractions when you travel, you see"
"6676650","6683370"," how powerful the United States actually is on the world stage."
"6685650","6687090"," It's not always talked about. "
"6687670","6692110"," There's a lot of like, you don't want to like, you don't want to like, it's a poor way to"
"6692110","6692530"," describe it."
"6692750","6695770"," You don't want to diss other people in the public on the world stage, right?"
"6695770","6697770"," There's diplomacy and that kind of stuff."
"6698830","6702610"," But the U.S. dude is, it's mind boggling. "
"6704330","6708090"," And then the history of fighting all that kind of stuff, China doesn't have any of that."
"6708870","6714530"," They have tech, but a lot of their tech is not just unproven, but it's not the best tech."
"6714710","6717470"," There's a lot of fake tech in China, even in their military. "
"6727760","6733920"," No, you know, I don't, I'm not in that same camp there with nuclear war."
"6734240","6738500"," I'm not, I was in, I was in the military in the U.S. Army command."
"6739020","6740220"," I'm not on that same page. "
"6740960","6744180"," A lot of what's, a lot of what you're told is not the truth."
"6745240","6750360"," A lot of what you're told of a lot of what you see on TV, a lot of what you"
"6750360","6753140"," see in documentaries, a lot of what you see that's public information."
"6753740","6755500"," It's completely different than the truth. "
"6756060","6756700"," And I mean completely."
"6757280","6763040"," It doesn't matter if it's someone from the left talking, someone from the right talking."
"6764120","6768900"," It's intentionally obfuscated and fed whatever you want to hear. "
"6770420","6771160"," Absolutely not."
"6772360","6778420"," Like none of my experience, no matter what I was doing, was ever, you could turn on, you could be"
"6778420","6778740"," in and out."
"6779320","6781500"," AFN could be on, you'd be watching Fox News or CNN. "
"6783280","6785180"," None of them knew what the fuck was going on."
"6787440","6790500"," I don't know why that is a very bizarre thing when you see it."
"6791660","6796480"," When you see it, Ben, like, like the real truth of the matter. "
"6800220","6801180"," It's very bizarre."
"6801560","6805840"," There's like this whole like theater versus the reality."
"6819240","6820360"," Yeah, never in the news. "
"6821130","6823240"," There's like there's so much stuff that you don't see."
"6824380","6826320"," It tells one story."
"6826540","6827260"," It was like always fun. "
"6827400","6833040"," Fascinating was a station in Korea one time."
"6834580","6842140"," They had an AWAC or something was robbed or something in China, in the sea China, I think."
"6842860","6844840"," And it was forced to land in China. "
"6846280","6853820"," And the U.S. like said, they weren't going to continue any flights, any spy flights."
"6854000","6854720"," Dude, they're fucking flying."
"6854980","6855720"," They're fucking flying. "
"6855800","6856080"," You choose."
"6858680","6860020"," We're off an air force base."
"6860900","6862640"," Fucking through the whole entire thing. "
"6863360","6863980"," Straight north."
"6865660","6865880"," Screaming."
"6866120","6874220"," You know, like, what you're told and what is reality is two different things. "
"6876580","6877520"," Spoons right now."
"6878220","6879760"," Come on, spoons."
"6881260","6882420"," Start squeezing them. "
"6897860","6899260"," I didn't know all of it."
"6899360","6901280"," Like, so I was like a line level soldier."
"6901860","6903360"," And then I rejoined the army. "
"6903920","6904960"," And I went to U.S. army command."
"6905400","6907940"," And that's when I started sitting rooms, right, sitting rooms."
"6908840","6910540"," And they got the glycerins up everywhere. "
"6910900","6912320"," And they get the smelly pencils."
"6912400","6915640"," And they're talking about all, like, if this happens to do this, that happens to do that."
"6915880","6916240"," It was wild. "
"6917600","6919260"," It was absolutely wild."
"6919480","6920920"," And, like, that kind of situation ever happens."
"6921240","6928120"," And we're building up for that right now to be in that footing. "
"6929280","6932720"," Fed bids for 52 week bills, total $3 billion."
"6933340","6936860"," When you see, like, you see, like, how long the buildup took in Iraq?"
"6937840","6939340"," We're doing that right now."
"6940100","6941380"," We're doing that same buildup. "
"6942380","6944100"," Currently, we're doing that right now."
"6944100","6945980"," That same buildup is happening."
"6952860","6954600"," Currently, I think they're ready by 2024. "
"6955160","6957900"," I think the U.S. will be ready by the way right around there, 2024, somewhere in there."
"6958440","6960060"," And that's led that lead up in the next couple of years."
"6963460","6965080"," I hope it resolves itself, too. "
"6965220","6967780"," I'm not anti-China, per se."
"6969020","6970020"," Come on, baby, start squeezing."
"6971460","6973960"," Sit in there all day long waiting for this. "
"6974180","6975300"," 11-16 in the morning."
"6976680","6978060"," Oh, yeah, 11-16."
"6978340","6979780"," We're even inside day right now or what?"
"6979980","6981020"," No, we're not inside day. "
"6986440","6992360"," So, my hope here is that, because that's what China did, right?"
"6992520","6999700"," They joined the U.N. They joined a free trade agreement of some kind."
"6999700","7004700"," And they built up their military during that time period rather than..."
"7007220","7009280"," That's secretively, what kind of secretively."
"7010040","7013900"," But of course, with their own hegemony in the world, right?"
"7014960","7016540"," They're doing their own stuff. "
"7017040","7023480"," And if that's the case, I don't know how it ends for China."
"7023920","7026740"," I'm not really a believer in China having that ability."
"7030080","7031260"," It could be wrong, I guess. "
"7031580","7031860"," We'll see."
"7042570","7045330"," Sellers here relentlessly trying to sell this market down."
"7046350","7048490"," We know why and that they're here. "
"7048850","7050730"," We know that this is kind of the place where they get overrun."
"7051370","7052430"," I'm still long calls here."
"7052950","7055310"," I'm going to leave these things on all day long for a squeeze hire. "
"7057330","7058630"," I'm looking to see a squeeze."
"7058630","7060950"," This is a hedge to my puts on the month."
"7061390","7064950"," So, we'll see what happens here. "
"7070450","7072650"," Sellers not wanting to get overrun in this market."
"7073170","7076610"," They're doing anything that they can, trying to push this thing down."
"7078090","7079950"," Maybe trying to pin this thing for CPI. "
"7080330","7080610"," I don't know."
"7080770","7081070"," I don't care."
"7082670","7085690"," I heard people earlier talking about a front running of CPI. "
"7088610","7094810"," This usually does not end well for a sell side."
"7097230","7098630"," Usually does not end well."
"7102310","7104490"," More time we spend on the early trigger. "
"7106070","7107470"," Then check right now, see."
"7108290","7109390"," More time we spend here, man."
"7109930","7111050"," More bullish we get. "
"7112650","7114250"," Yeah, I'm looking right now."
"7117810","7119710"," We get real bullish here, man."
"7120030","7121950"," The more time we spend above consolidating. "
"7123570","7125450"," Above this early trigger, the way that we are."
"7126350","7127510"," It's not short live."
"7128110","7130310"," It's actually a good time to talk about this example too. "
"7131150","7132850"," So, this is in our white paper right here."
"7133830","7135090"," And we'll talk about this real quick."
"7137050","7143660"," So, there's a behavior that we notice. "
"7147040","7149360"," If you get a quick blast up over."
"7150600","7155220"," If you get a quick blast up above the early trigger, they tend not to hold."
"7157180","7158460"," They tend not to hold. "
"7158680","7162840"," We tend to actually come back down, not just retest, but we break through and below."
"7163600","7164520"," This one right here."
"7165240","7169860"," When we start grinding up like this and we start consolidating here and we start doing this shit. "
"7170120","7172160"," We're like retesting, retesting, retesting."
"7172160","7173340"," Not always."
"7173900","7180780"," We tend to have an explosive sustained move higher. "
"7182840","7185200"," We're actually on a new upper level."
"7185420","7186340"," So, paying attention to it."
"7187680","7189300"," I'm watching it right now. "
"7189600","7190520"," Long calls to the upside."
"7192140","7192800"," Pretty bullish here."
"7195700","7198940"," Interesting to see how this works itself out. "
"7199240","7200520"," You know the sellers are already up here."
"7200520","7201700"," We already know the sellers are here."
"7202540","7204420"," We know the sellers are right here. "
"7204760","7206300"," We know the sellers are back up here."
"7206660","7207900"," Right on this whole trend here."
"7208000","7208940"," Trying to sell this down. "
"7209320","7209680"," It's worked."
"7210000","7210260"," It's worked."
"7210780","7211120"," It's worked. "
"7211160","7211940"," It's worked back here."
"7212840","7213380"," Worked here."
"7213540","7213860"," Worked here. "
"7214000","7214340"," Worked here."
"7214420","7216820"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
"7217980","7222840"," And we also know that at some point, it's not going to work any longer. "
"7223700","7225440"," The failure is to get new lows here."
"7226180","7229040"," Here and here and here."
"7229040","7232540"," the U.S. sells 38 billion and 52 week bills. "
"7233040","7234160"," Sellers need some news."
"7235180","7236500"," We're also going to get over a run."
"7236660","7238620"," We're looking to hit some previous highs up here. "
"7238700","7244380"," We got a price target above of 4.41.46. We have another one higher at 4.42.39. We"
"7244380","7248160"," have 4.43.48. This dream is sponsored."
"7248320","7254300"," Then we have 4.44.24. Three daily points to Benachi and market profile levels by signing up."
"7254600","7256000"," The last thing is getting bullish. "
"7257480","7260620"," We just went from zero line to now it's up about 27."
"7261740","7266680"," We'll look to see if this will squeeze at some point either today or tomorrow."
"7268360","7270620"," Sellers really need some bad news, man. "
"7270880","7272400"," They need some bad news."
"7275360","7276580"," Really bad news."
"7280620","7286660"," We got CPI tomorrow at 8.30. You have both stick at 1 tomorrow. "
"7286680","7288240"," You're going to get claims on Thursday."
"7288780","7289740"," PPI on Thursday."
"7290080","7290560"," That's big stuff. "
"7292620","7294480"," These numbers should be good."
"7295560","7297880"," Your PPI, I don't know if it will show this."
"7298580","7299620"," I want you to know something. "
"7300720","7308720"," So like PPI right now should come in really good"
"7308720","7312500"," for bulls, for buyers."
"7312500","7314360"," It should be a good number."
"7315260","7316520"," PPI should come down. "
"7318200","7319100"," What else we got?"
"7319220","7322400"," Consumer sentiment, import price index on Friday."
"7323680","7324860"," Dude, I don't know, man."
"7325160","7327440"," We're going to get an explosive move higher. "
"7330700","7333540"," I can see now why you're thinking about front running CPI."
"7335420","7338860"," There is something to be said here for bears."
"7341180","7349360"," When inflation is dropping historically, there are some bumps in the road. "
"7349360","7350560"," Let me bring that up."
"7352760","7353600"," Hold on here."
"7359820","7361020"," I'm going to bring this up here. "
"7361160","7361300"," Hold on."
"7362600","7364840"," There are sometimes bumps in the road."
"7365880","7373960"," Mark me saying this too, too, because when inflation is falling, usually two or three times you'll"
"7373960","7378140"," get an uptick in inflation in that downward move. "
"7378620","7380340"," It's not usually a clean move down."
"7381120","7382540"," I don't know if you know that or not."
"7384180","7386940"," Let me see if I can bring it up here in the background. "
"7388040","7389940"," So I guess there's the chance."
"7393040","7395360"," Maybe you're just flat into that report."
"7399040","7401080"," Let me see if I can find it here. "
"7411850","7414010"," Not quite there yet, though."
"7414670","7419490"," I'm trying to look back on inflation here."
"7423720","7425900"," It's got some more down to come here. "
"7428120","7433300"," Dude, I was out shopping this week, and I did see lower prices."
"7433300","7434660"," I did see them."
"7441040","7442680"," Not everybody's. "
"7443460","7445000"," I'll show you how I put this."
"7445440","7449340"," Not everybody is lowering their prices."
"7452400","7459100"," I'm seeing more price gouging from small business owners than I am from large business owners. "
"7460080","7462980"," Large business owners, I'm seeing prices coming down."
"7469300","7472200"," Small business owners, they're price gouging now."
"7475840","7480200"," But there is a reversal going on in larger companies. "
"7481200","7482420"," I'm noticing it."
"7484340","7487100"," I'm going to assume that PPI is lower."
"7491540","7500920"," Sometimes you'll get a bump in inflation as it's coming down, but it's not on your side. "
"7501160","7506960"," You're in a better chance of CPI coming in positive for bulls."
"7514260","7515520"," You have a little surprise."
"7515520","7524260"," I was noticing price gouging en masse"
"7524260","7530320"," from large corporations when they shouldn't be, and when it should start to come down and it"
"7530320","7534060"," wasn't, I was like, yeah, this is coordinated. "
"7535600","7540960"," This is like mostly retail goods, that kind of stuff."
"7542500","7547060"," And of course, PPI was looking good and prices were still high."
"7547660","7553080"," And then as a matter of fact, you saw Biden threatening people or threatening like business, like"
"7553080","7556660"," large businesses saying, you know, I'm going to come after you and this and that, whatever. "
"7558340","7562920"," Then recently, I've noticed some pricing coming down."
"7563140","7564960"," I told you about about three racks of eggs."
"7565520","7569060"," They were a dollar and they were in a grocery store. "
"7569060","7572000"," And I was like, start seeing this."
"7573680","7581220"," What happens is if you get, if everybody's got that $10 eggs, that's one thing, right?"
"7581900","7587140"," If you then start to have some of these companies going, well, I'm going to do dollar eggs."
"7587560","7588640"," You keep your eggs at $6. "
"7590160","7594560"," It creates people wanting to shop for better pricing."
"7595420","7598700"," If you don't have that choice, you know, the choice, right?"
"7598840","7600660"," You're like, fuck man, eggs are going to be three bucks here."
"7600800","7603340"," It'd be three bucks over there, ten bucks or five bucks or whatever. "
"7603900","7609920"," The moment you have a competitor saying, no, we're going back to dollar or whatever it is."
"7611420","7618520"," It starts to increase competition and that helps you as a consumer to be able to find better"
"7618520","7618860"," pricing."
"7618860","7621720"," I know we're not seeing that everywhere. "
"7622280","7624520"," The used car market is a disaster."
"7625440","7626740"," A new car market is a disaster."
"7626980","7627480"," Still a disaster. "
"7630160","7630940"," Still horrible."
"7631340","7633320"," A rental market, still a disaster."
"7633980","7635420"," A housing market, still a disaster. "
"7637680","7644760"," But some of that retail sales stuff or the PPI, the producer should be a good number."
"7644760","7646680"," Even if CPI is going to be flat."
"7647140","7648520"," Even if you get flat on CPI. "
"7650660","7657600"," And they're not going to account for that small time, that small business person that's still price"
"7657600","7658140"," gouging."
"7658460","7660660"," Those aren't going to make a big dent in those numbers."
"7661400","7664620"," They're just not selling enough eggs to impact those numbers. "
"7665680","7666300"," I agree with housing."
"7667360","7668480"," Used car markets are a disaster."
"7669280","7674540"," I read a story about the, I guess the story came up before the death of the $5,000 used"
"7674540","7674840"," car. "
"7675880","7677620"," Someone was talking about it the other day."
"7677800","7680720"," It was in a forum where people were talking about the price of used cars."
"7681040","7684180"," I watched some guy on YouTube who does used car market stuff. "
"7685520","7693560"," And he was talking about the influx of repossessions"
"7693560","7697460"," hitting car auctions."
"7697460","7700740"," That's not necessarily bad yet for our economy."
"7702160","7711960"," Joe Donut was talking to me about how all of these dealers know what's coming. "
"7712820","7716620"," So what they're doing is they're giving two loans instead of one."
"7717580","7720980"," Or excuse me, you have two current loans, maybe two new ones."
"7721680","7726140"," They're giving people that they know are at risk of defaulting their last loan in their last new"
"7726140","7726440"," car. "
"7728960","7731440"," All these small banks will get rolled over."
"7731920","7732480"," We've done this before."
"7734120","7737640"," People will buy a car and lose their house so they can always get to their job. "
"7737940","7739660"," They don't care about their house like they care about their cars."
"7740580","7742780"," That kind of stuff all plays into this, the mechanics of this."
"7743080","7747660"," And even though you're seeing these repos coming in, a lot of those repos are coming in from people"
"7747660","7749960"," that were given a second or third or fourth. "
"7750440","7752360"," They're married a third or fourth car loan."
"7752360","7757100"," And while they're having their previous car, repossessed."
"7757380","7763520"," Now, we will deal with that stuff, but we may not deal with it right now, right?"
"7763800","7768620"," Timing-wise, that shit doesn't come to roost for a year or two years. "
"7769580","7774160"," Six months down the road, 2024, 2025, that kind of stuff."
"7775300","7779340"," But it's fascinating because the used car market has not come down in pricing."
"7779680","7786340"," I was watching a guy just a couple nights ago, and he was like, you know, like they're selling $5 "
"7786340","7788360",",000 cars for $10,000 right now. "
"7789820","7793560"," And then those reading the comments and stuff and people were like, oh, yeah."
"7793920","7800460"," So when a guy said he sold a Honda Civic or something, he's like, I sold one for about $1 "
"7800460","7800840",",500."
"7800840","7806900"," It was a 1999 or something or a 98 Honda Accord. "
"7806960","7809040"," And he's like, I remember selling it for $1,500."
"7809900","7812640"," And my friend just bought one for $5,000."
"7814760","7822340"," And so I agree that some of the inflation is definitely still there in parts of our economy. "
"7826590","7834390"," Yeah, so the 4.8% drop in the used car market, it's like housing."
"7836690","7844070"," Homes that I own, if I told you how much they're up, you could make my house come down 50 "
"7844070","7848570","% in value, and I'm still up hundreds of percent."
"7850370","7852590"," It's like those numbers don't mean anything to me. "
"7852810","7855590"," Like cars coming down 4.8%, I mean nothing."
"7856110","7863170"," When you're talking about a car that was once a $1,500 car going $5,000, what's 4.8%. What's"
"7863170","7864770"," that 4.8% of?"
"7864950","7869410"," Is it of the $5,000 or is it of its previous price four years ago?"
"7871290","7872410"," You know what I'm saying by that?"
"7872710","7877030"," Like a lot of these numbers that were fed, like it's coming down, it's coming down."
"7877730","7879170"," There's still a re-pricing in there. "
"7879510","7881250"," That re-pricing needs to go back away."
"7891760","7892580"," Am I still bullish?"
"7892840","7893480"," Fuck yeah, I'm bullish."
"7894020","7895380"," Hell yeah, I'm bullish here. "
"7897320","7899060"," Hell yes, I'm bullish here."
"7901620","7903320"," Hell yes, velocity is saying we're going up."
"7905960","7909060"," Velocity is saying we're going up here, so it's still long here. "
"7913140","7915100"," Yeah, like I said, Europe is looking strong."
"7916620","7918980"," It's supposed to be a corporate saw coordinating pass on lower price."
"7919180","7921460"," The consumers never have before, but looks, yeah, I agree with that. "
"7922240","7924140"," Yeah, the corporations can do that."
"7924320","7924660"," You'll see."
"7925940","7928080"," If the corporations do it, you'll see it. "
"7932670","7935750"," Yeah, the four-point, they talk about this with housing, man."
"7936030","7940230"," Like it's so bizarre and you're like the guy that owns the house."
"7940230","7941190"," I own houses. "
"7941470","7944130"," People are like, yeah, the housing market just rolled over."
"7944550","7947370"," It's worse than spending since 2008."
"7947850","7953950"," Like the biggest, like the show in the chart, this one guy's showing the chart on YouTube, and I'm"
"7953950","7955250"," like, you're already a fucking mind. "
"7956170","7962150"," These houses were worth, like in the late 2000s, like $150,000 house worth fucking a couple million"
"7962150","7962650"," right now."
"7963570","7966110"," It's down from $2 million to $1.8 million."
"7966110","7969690"," I'm like, that house was $150,000 in 2008. "
"7970070","7973870"," It's like, it's like, I'm part of that generation."
"7974390","7978070"," Like, houses were dirt cheap."
"7979070","7987950"," The housing market that I got involved in was about, now I'm doing like COVID shit. "
"7987950","7996890"," Like, 2008, 2007 was big, and then we're"
"7996890","7998850"," in 2023."
"7999750","8002750"," Like the real ramp and like a second ramp and pricing took place."
"8006230","8008470"," Seven to 10 years ago, somewhere in there. "
"8009790","8011730"," And it's stupid."
"8012510","8015110"," A lot of people were buying this shit right up into COVID."
"8018170","8021530"," So, you know, there's not a lot of stock available. "
"8022190","8026870"," And so like, it's funny to kind of watch people say like, oh, there's been a housing crash."
"8027130","8028310"," I'm like, there hasn't."
"8029470","8031570"," Fuck no, there hasn't been a housing crash. "
"8032610","8037110"," Maybe if you bought last year or something, I don't know, maybe you bought last year."
"8038910","8044770"," I guess you're experiencing a housing crash maybe, but not if you bought pre-COVID."
"8044770","8049950"," You're fucking way up, way, way up. "
"8054360","8057740"," Yeah, so Dan just said my house doubled in value in four years."
"8058200","8059920"," Like, and I don't disagree."
"8060340","8063500"," Some of it is like, some of it is the things we know it is about. "
"8063980","8072140"," But some of it is still like just the cost of building a house, cost of renovating, cost of the"
"8072140","8073960"," goods, but the services side of it."
"8073960","8078100"," Like the labor to build right now is not cheap, dude."
"8078100","8078680"," It's double. "
"8079800","8080500"," It's double."
"8081060","8082940"," Like the labor to build right now is double."
"8084280","8086580"," So if anyone's like, yeah, you're going to see a housing crash. "
"8086580","8087700"," I'm like, I don't think so."
"8088200","8096700"," You'd have to see a wage crack crash maybe."
"8096900","8098680"," Maybe you saw a wage crash, you'd see it. "
"8099120","8101200"," Like that whole aspect of it's not being discussed."
"8101760","8103220"," I don't see it being discussed."
"8105100","8107620"," But the cost to do this stuff is through the roof. "
"8109180","8116640"," I'm trying to go to an auction this fall and I'm trying to logically"
"8116640","8125560"," find out if it's worth buying some of these houses because they're still great."
"8125720","8126800"," They still have a great price on them."
"8127360","8131340"," But I'm like, I used to be able to like grab one of these houses, just flip it. "
"8131760","8137440"," I simply grab one of these houses and renovate it and have a nice wide margin of profit."
"8139340","8141960"," And for me to have a nice wide margin of profit."
"8142480","8144200"," It's like, it's like years ago, right?"
"8144420","8145900"," I would have, I had some friends. "
"8146160","8148000"," They would buy a house in a nice, nice community."
"8150500","8152780"," And what I always, what I always remember was."
"8153760","8160440"," When flippers and rehabbers were getting trouble was when they would buy homes with credit. "
"8161380","8165620"," In nice places and have a very tight."
"8166800","8168380"," Have a very tight."
"8171480","8175960"," Like budget and then profit margin. "
"8176420","8178920"," It was more about prestige than anything."
"8178920","8182580"," Like, oh, I bought a house for $150,000."
"8183160","8186620"," In a neighborhood where houses cost $300,000. "
"8187900","8189540"," So I'm just going to do this topical stuff."
"8190220","8195180"," And when I make 50, 60k, pay my taxes on that shit 30% of that."
"8195719","8197480"," Might walk away with this much money. "
"8197940","8199600"," And I got to hire a lot of people to do it though."
"8199820","8201320"," I guess it's not that low, but whatever."
"8201740","8201959"," Doesn't matter. "
"8202980","8203780"," The comps are good here."
"8203900","8204540"," I'm going to make all this money."
"8204540","8209459"," And then they get, they get caught in a recession where they don't have any buyers and they get"
"8209459","8211780"," rolled over and they go bankrupt as a flipper. "
"8212980","8214200"," It's all because of prestige."
"8216420","8218400"," Rather than buy something that's cheap, they're cheap."
"8218559","8219139"," You can sit on it. "
"8219219","8219820"," You can pay the taxes."
"8220080","8222000"," My fact that's got fucked on my taxes again."
"8222600","8224240"," I just found out that I got fucked on some taxes. "
"8225059","8227580"," I wasn't aware of property taxes."
"8227959","8228520"," Like super fucked."
"8229320","8235000"," My property taxes are up almost 130% or something like that. "
"8236120","8237280"," I'm a little angry right now."
"8237540","8238400"," I forgot about that."
"8238500","8241100"," I wanted to talk about that this week and I didn't. "
"8241240","8251200"," Anyways, where I live of pre-COVID in places like it, there"
"8251200","8256600"," was such a wide margin for error for if we win or recession."
"8258920","8261480"," Cost of services, cost of goods, all of it."
"8262280","8264900"," Led to a nice, easy buffer for mistakes. "
"8266260","8269480"," Led to a place where if we had a recession, I could rent them out."
"8270219","8272340"," There's a lot of safety involved in that."
"8272500","8275139"," You're not going to go to most neighborhoods, nice neighborhoods. "
"8275940","8284580"," Buy any house and expect 100, 200, 300% return on that investment if you're going to sell it."
"8286719","8289459"," And you want built in renters too, right?"
"8289600","8292639"," So you want to be in an area where there's a lot of working class population to rent to the"
"8292639","8293000"," get cut."
"8293200","8297660"," It's like all these dynamics in house flipping and house zoning and stuff like that. "
"8302520","8304260"," So I'm looking at these houses."
"8304959","8306340"," I'm actually looking at sheets right now."
"8306500","8312080"," I'm looking at like fucking spreadsheets with addresses and I'm going through these spreadsheets"
"8312080","8313299"," right now for Detroit. "
"8313820","8314620"," For the fall."
"8316040","8320940"," So every night I'll sit there and I'll go zip code by zip code looking for houses to arrive in"
"8320940","8321920"," this auction that's coming up."
"8322040","8322480"," It's coming up soon. "
"8324360","8329760"," And I'm like, okay, I'm going to whittle this down to maybe 30, 40 properties."
"8330459","8336340"," Start driving around Detroit and checking out these houses and seeing if any of them are viable."
"8336700","8338420"," But even with that, right, here's the catch. "
"8340559","8344639"," Let's say about a house for between five and $15,000."
"8345340","8354780"," A renovation that might cost me"
"8354780","8356180"," 50 grand."
"8357059","8359740"," And you savings to cut budget deficits. "
"8362900","8367080"," So let's say that renovation would have known the normally that house would have cost me three to"
"8367080","8367639"," three to."
"8367780","8369180"," Still three to 15, but."
"8369840","8371780"," That renovation might have cost me 50 K."
"8372180","8373480"," So I'm in now for. "
"8374320","8375200"," Sixty five."
"8375379","8376219"," Plus the carry."
"8376400","8377040"," Plus the taxes. "
"8377940","8379520"," I can either put someone in it."
"8379860","8380600"," I can flip it."
"8380980","8384879"," I can put a nice big fat price tag on it like hundred grand hundred twenty five grand. "
"8385100","8385580"," Nobody bites."
"8385680","8386620"," I can drop the price."
"8387540","8388300"," Maybe catch. "
"8389660","8392060"," Seventy, eighty, ninety thousand dollars, hundred thousand dollars."
"8392220","8392300"," Right."
"8392500","8393120"," Charged 125. "
"8394000","8394700"," I was back down."
"8395000","8397560"," I think I'm all in now for sixty five maybe."
"8398320","8400320"," I'm making almost eighty, ninety percent. "
"8400680","8401260"," Pay me taxes."
"8401620","8401700"," Done."
"8402160","8402640"," I'm out, right. "
"8404460","8406100"," But right now it's not like that."
"8406320","8409920"," I'm looking at these houses and I'm like, that's going to cost me a hundred K probably."
"8410940","8413560"," So now I'm like, oh, I'm in now for a hundred thousand dollars. "
"8413820","8417020"," I'm like, no, I'm going to be asking how much for it plus the carry."
"8417020","8417480"," So."
"8418160","8419080"," Plus taxes. "
"8419660","8420340"," Plus the taxes."
"8420440","8421560"," I'm going to pay the proper taxes."
"8421580","8423760"," I'm going to pay this thirty percent on the. "
"8426420","8427400"," Couple of gains taxes."
"8427420","8428260"," All that stuff."
"8428700","8432800"," I'm like, oh, now I got to charge hundred seventy five thousand, fifty thousand. "
"8432840","8437120"," I probably asked close to take one fifty to one sixty one seventy."
"8438180","8441460"," And I'm seeing houses like that in Detroit now being asked."
"8441780","8443720"," That's the ask right now on the shitty houses. "
"8443720","8445420"," The traits come from."
"8446240","8452260"," You know, like thirty five, like a thousand bucks to sixty five to seventy five."
"8453040","8455820"," Maybe on the high end, a hundred to two hundred and fifty. "
"8456240","8458280"," There's a million dollar homes all over Detroit right now."
"8458420","8460560"," Million dollar homes, multi million dollar homes."
"8461540","8465440"," Six hundred thousand dollar homes, four hundred thousand dollars, five hundred thousand dollars. "
"8465980","8470260"," And just like starter homes are back to a normalization to some extent."
"8470260","8475940"," That are rendered renovated live live in updated everything, right?"
"8476120","8477860"," Get all new electrical, all new plumbing."
"8479400","8480480"," Let's been removed. "
"8480860","8482980"," All that stuff for a baited one of the other."
"8483580","8486820"," And those are all going for hundred twenty five hundred fifty."
"8487620","8488840"," Thousand dollars minimum. "
"8497530","8501810"," So people are paying you whatever they can to wire houses right now."
"8502730","8503910"," Turning work down everywhere."
"8504070","8505010"," Yeah, it's a real weird. "
"8506350","8508850"," Yeah, replacement cost is why far to super expensive."
"8509090","8510930"," That's what that's my only thought here is."
"8512230","8515550"," The cost of labor, the cost of goods is expensive. "
"8516450","8518270"," Like two by fours are still fucking expensive."
"8518350","8519270"," They're not still not cheap."
"8522650","8524350"," The wire is not cheap. "
"8525590","8527130"," Plumbing supplies, not cheap."
"8527830","8532350"," Still wait lists on on anything that's not build or grade material that you can't get like home"
"8532350","8533170"," depot or some shit."
"8533250","8534970"," Or Bernard's or building builder supply. "
"8535790","8537430"," But labor is expensive as fuck."
"8537730","8539350"," Like it is fucking expensive."
"8541410","8544130"," So roofs have come down a little bit in material cost. "
"8544830","8546870"," I've seen some good deals on materials for roofing."
"8548110","8549830"," But no good deals on labor."
"8550430","8551310"," Labor is still for the roof. "
"8551890","8553910"," And it's your lower end labor."
"8554850","8559650"," The laborers are up bank like 30 bucks an hour for a labor."
"8559750","8560170"," That's you get to pay. "
"8560270","8561510"," It's going right for a labor right now."
"8561530","8562530"," I'm going to try 30 bucks an hour."
"8563230","8563650"," That's minimum. "
"8565730","8568450"," Now they used to get 15, 20 bucks an hour."
"8568870","8570310"," They're up to 30 dollars an hour."
"8579290","8584150"," Yeah, I was thinking about doing a video series on this house buying. "
"8585030","8587090"," They're going to attempt to do this fall."
"8587390","8589030"," So we talked about it a few months ago."
"8591410","8594970"," If I find these houses to be even. "
"8596970","8598050"," Considered to buy."
"8598610","8602670"," I'll give you guys the list of the addresses and I usually take videos of these houses."
"8604190","8607870"," So what I'll do what I normally do is I whittle it down to like. "
"8609110","8612430"," You used to be able to whittle it down to like a hundred houses and I drive and hit them"
"8612430","8613970"," all but streaming I can't anymore."
"8614650","8618090"," So they can whittle it down to like 30 houses maybe 40 houses."
"8619130","8623170"," And I want to I'll drive there and I actually videotaped the entire thing. "
"8623610","8625810"," So maybe I'll post those to YouTube or something."
"8627490","8630890"," I'll do like a like same channel but like a different section."
"8631950","8633690"," So you guys can see what I look at. "
"8634750","8639830"," And I can usually give a fairly good idea of what it's going to cost what you can buy it"
"8639830","8640010"," for."
"8640670","8642270"," And then when I'll go through the bidding process."
"8643990","8646690"," And I write down everything like what is it going to cost. "
"8646690","8650050"," What is it going to cost for the materials labor."
"8651210","8653110"," What I should pay for it at auction."
"8653590","8656970"," And then if I usually look what happens is this. "
"8657530","8660150"," I usually find like 30 well usually find a hundred."
"8661510","8667570"," And then when the auction comes up I'm looking for one to 15 of those properties to have no"
"8667570","8668570"," interest in them."
"8670170","8673350"," And I don't bother even bidding on the ones with interest. "
"8673350","8675990"," The thing about an auction is if anybody's really interested."
"8676630","8680090"," They'll bid it to the fucking moon and it won't be worth buying."
"8680670","8684810"," Usually though there's like some properties that nobody looked at. "
"8686110","8690970"," Or they don't know what they're talking about or something like that."
"8691170","8692610"," And you can like sneak in on those."
"8693490","8695030"," And you'll be the only bidder. "
"8696610","8699250"," And normally you're paying just the back taxes."
"8699690","8702070"," And then you're paying the Ford six months on that house."
"8711970","8718130"," This buying is being a dick. "
"8719470","8720730"," This old house status."
"8721510","8722130"," The other good houses."
"8723010","8724830"," The best part about these houses too. "
"8725290","8728450"," It's like the trade has this program called the Land to Trade Land Bank."
"8729130","8731950"," And I bought one house via the Land Bank."
"8732370","8733030"," Never again. "
"8734650","8735510"," It's a scam."
"8737210","8740850"," They're like they're like you can buy a house for five hundred bucks or something or a thousand"
"8740850","8741090"," bucks."
"8741610","8743210"," And you have to bid against other people. "
"8743710","8745010"," It's a total fucking scam."
"8745970","8750430"," The adjacent properties that they offer that are just land those are good."
"8751210","8754290"," But don't ever buy a house for the Detroit Land Bank ever. "
"8756250","8757630"," Just fucking around here."
"8758230","8759870"," Sideways market on spy right now."
"8760730","8762710"," But don't ever buy a house to the Detroit Land Bank. "
"8762830","8763770"," If you're going to buy a house from Detroit."
"8764830","8766490"," Or in Wayne County in general."
"8768790","8770490"," You buy them at the county auctions. "
"8773350","8774770"," For a multitude of reasons."
"8775890","8777130"," This applies anywhere in the country."
"8777350","8779370"," You can go to a bunch of different kinds of auctions too. "
"8779970","8782850"," Your county usually has these auctions wherever you live."
"8782850","8784770"," Your county usually holds them."
"8785190","8788230"," They also have courthouse step auctions as well. "
"8789050","8791370"," So there's like multiple types of auctions."
"8791370","8792410"," Those are good too."
"8793890","8798890"," But any of like any kind of program for you to get involved in with any county in the United"
"8798890","8799790"," States of America. "
"8800110","8801170"," Stay the fuck away."
"8802130","8803150"," Those houses."
"8804580","8807970"," They are no matter what carrot they're dangling in front of you. "
"8808890","8812130"," They're going to make you do shit that you just you can't afford."
"8812690","8814030"," You can't afford to do."
"8815270","8816670"," Here's an example. "
"8816890","8818210"," So I did a land bank house right."
"8820570","8826930"," And this land bank house had a pole to the house wiring to it."
"8829430","8831930"," And because it was a land bank house. "
"8831930","8837530"," They have these like archaic rules like if the power hasn't been on in five years or ten years."
"8838190","8839890"," You have to bury everything."
"8840650","8841530"," I'm like okay. "
"8842130","8843290"," But I didn't know that."
"8843570","8844650"," So I buy this house right."
"8846690","8849610"," And then I was within the five years or something. "
"8850410","8852750"," They were like nope you bought it through the land bank."
"8853170","8857230"," So we have an agreement with the county where you still have to bury your power."
"8858110","8863010"," And for me to bury power at this house was like 15 grand. "
"8864470","8865830"," Unless I did it myself."
"8866830","8869090"," The ditch which dig out to the street."
"8870330","8871310"," Very the fucking power. "
"8871490","8872930"," Very fucking the pipes."
"8874150","8876790"," Run the water or snub it out to the pole."
"8879190","8881070"," So like yeah if you want to do that yourself. "
"8881930","8883450"," Sure you can do that."
"8885150","8888610"," You want to you want to dig a hole then underneath the sidewalk too."
"8889130","8891770"," It's like you need a good I don't need the sidewalk without destroying the sidewalk. "
"8891790","8893530"," Then you need to come up to the pole."
"8896170","8896890"," Fucking nightmare."
"8898290","8902050"," Now if you buy if I bought a house through the through the county auction. "
"8903330","8905430"," That this power from that pole to that house."
"8905990","8907290"," I don't have to do that."
"8911070","8912830"," Another thing with land bank right. "
"8913630","8918350"," Let it be meant and let removal can be either a fucking nightmare."
"8918970","8923930"," Like nightmare like you're talking about ripping out everything to stud."
"8924910","8928590"," I mean everything like everything is gone which is what I ended up doing in this house. "
"8928850","8930190"," I took everything to stud."
"8930370","8933010"," It's my preferred way but to do this anyways."
"8933650","8937610"," But you're talking about like requirements from a county government. "
"8937610","8941830"," And you jump over every single last two."
"8942170","8943230"," Every single one."
"8943550","8945910"," And by the time you're done you built yourself a house. "
"8946730","8949250"," And you're under time requirements on this as well."
"8949730","8952310"," You can't transfer these homes if you get signed off from them."
"8953370","8956290"," It gives like it's signatures on every step of the process. "
"8957110","8960610"," You're paying every little every single thing is not just a code."

"8981550","8982510"," I'm still bullish here."
"8983470","8985410"," Ask me in the chat if I'm still bullish. "
"8986110","8986810"," My God."

"9003910","9004270"," That's fine."
"9004510","9004970"," But guess what?"
"9005090","9006150"," You can do it on your own time."
"9006990","9007630"," Makes sense. "
"9009450","9013510"," You want to put in for like you should like you're building a house, right?"
"9014310","9018870"," And you're like, okay, I'm going to put in the minimum to code outlets."
"9019730","9024130"," And then, of course, your contractor is like, I'm going to leave a bunch of outlets behind the"

"9025070","9030590"," Once you get approved and so you can put them in later, you know, it's like it's all fucked up. "
"9030730","9036850"," So, you know, you're going to I used to like write down like this is how many outlets I'm putting"

"9045330","9049570"," Like, do that shit with the with the county or the land bank."
"9049590","9050630"," You can't do any of that shit."
"9052130","9052650"," So. "
"9056350","9058190"," Yeah, it was pretty bullish here."

"9252540","9254340"," as much work as you possibly can yourself."
"9255160","9260400"," Anything that's like a killer, like a deal killer, you try to do that yourself. "

"9293700","9295460"," Anywhere you can, there's other things too."
"9295620","9297220"," Like, can I pull my own permits?"

"9372970","9373810"," I don't like this."
"9374210","9375050"," Don't buy that house."
"9378470","9386050"," Roofing does suck, but you're talking about a 30, 40, $50,000 job that could cost you, like, $3,000"
"9386050","9387290"," to $6,000. "
"9389250","9391190"," Like, talking major hits."
"9392330","9393690"," Major, major hits."
"9395890","9397750"," It's not just the fucked up flooring. "
"9397890","9401870"," If they're covering up, they're likely covering up other shit, in my view."
"9404490","9407530"," Another easy one is that you can do yourself is windows."
"9408250","9409230"," That's another fucking scam. "
"9409930","9413030"," Like, windows are so easy to replace."
"9413950","9414890"," So easy."
"9415530","9417090"," Too easy to replace windows. "
"9418010","9419670"," It's another one that gets you into trouble."
"9421250","9423170"," The things they stay away from."
"9424130","9424710"," Foundations. "
"9428270","9429150"," Foundational stuff."

"9461220","9463020"," Nice tag of R2 right there."
"9467440","9469100"," Nice little squeeze right here. "

"9494240","9495820"," Cut water lines. "
"9496280","9496780"," Bad."
"9498260","9501140"," Dude, if you ever buy a house, I get some cool shit to you guys."

"9523480","9524140"," People don't believe this. "
"9524340","9526180"," I don't care what fucking house you buy out there."
"9526860","9528460"," Like, I bring a hose with me."
"9529180","9530880"," And I'll, like, go to the neighbor's house. "

"10164040","10165540"," Two things we're going to look at here. "
"10178640","10181180"," Just big boy stuff right here is a 30 minute chart, right?"
"10184840","10188140"," So you want to see this hold here at 441 24."
"10189060","10193840"," If it does not hold, we will come right back down here in tag 440."
"10194980","10197840"," So you're looking for a by right here right now. "
"10198200","10201540"," So right where we are right here."
"10202640","10204720"," You're looking for a by if not."
"10213750","10214970"," We will trade. "
"10218670","10220510"," Right here trade that."
"10221350","10222470"," Just right here."
"10222890","10225730"," You want to for this trend to continue up. "
"10226270","10228130"," You want to see this get bought right here."
"10228970","10229570"," Okay."
"10230910","10233090"," If trend is dead, which it shouldn't be. "
"10234930","10237030"," You should be buying this bar right now."
"10238690","10243970"," So this bar we should be we're not maybe not just this bar, but you want to be long here"
"10243970","10245370"," with a stop."
"10246770","10247990"," Underneath somewhere down here. "
"10248110","10250670"," Some with this should get bought up."
"10250730","10253350"," We should go right up here and hit these up here."
"10253470","10255210"," Trend should not be dead right now. "
"10256410","10257890"," You know, watch this take place."
"10257910","10259430"," See that big green box right there."
"10260270","10261970"," I was talking to you guys. "
"10262130","10263090"," I'm looking at shit in the background."
"10263590","10266030"," I would have bought that that that bar right there."
"10266030","10268250"," But if it comes back down, I'll see if I can grab it here in a minute. "
"10271230","10273270"," And jump on, grab something down in here."
"10274590","10276930"," If it rolls, it's going to roll hard and heavy."
"10278410","10282130"," To the downside, but it doesn't look like it's going to looks like we're just going to run right"
"10282130","10282830"," straight from here. "
"10285430","10288430"," So if you can give me one more red bar down here or some shit."
"10289310","10290370"," And I'll jump in with you again."
"10298520","10299720"," I'm really weird. "
"10311540","10313580"," Just watching right now to see what happens."
"10319410","10320590"," In that up."
"10348940","10354500"," I'm long right now on the 442 C's. "
"10396600","10399120"," So make sure if I have to buy some more, I'll add another 25."
"10426210","10427570"," H.I.G. is looking bullish."
"10430190","10431970"," VIX has a gap to close down below. "
"10434950","10438450"," Now is that looking to just recheck really quick itself, making sure it's going up."
"10439050","10440250"," IWM with a dip buy."
"10441270","10442430"," NVDA looking bullish. "
"10448760","10450900"," Trying to get Tesla here in the background."
"10456080","10459020"," Tesla still has some shit to close down below."
"10461420","10463040"," hourly looks like crap on it. "
"10464780","10466380"," Talk about Tesla here in a minute."
"10466460","10467760"," We talked about Tesla the other day, right?"
"10468000","10468080"," Yesterday."
"10468080","10471340"," I was like, I want to buy down here. "
"10471620","10474260"," So Tesla's showing that a little bit right now, right?"
"10475840","10479120"," Still showing some of that by that dip zone where to buy Tesla."
"10479620","10482000"," We talked about that on Tesla yesterday."
"10484740","10486260"," Hope you're making money with me. "
"10486500","10488380"," 442 C's going bur already."
"10499500","10501700"," See if the bulls can do it here."
"10505610","10507150"," They need to get a new high. "
"10507770","10508510"," How to high?"
"10508710","10511750"," Previous at 441.70. Bulls need to get another high."
"10512750","10513510"," It's about 1214."
"10514210","10516910"," I'd like to see a nice squeeze here. "
"10539190","10541170"," You guys have never seen me draw lines on this show."
"10541250","10542050"," I draw them all the time."
"10542090","10542610"," I'll be like, yeah. "
"10546220","10547780"," This is what I'm thinking of my brain at least."
"10561280","10563440"," So this line, this blue box right here."
"10565440","10566720"," I'll show you what I don't want to see. "
"10566720","10570340"," I'll show you the other side of this coin here."
"10574600","10576980"," The condition break down here."
"10577340","10579240"," 1, 2, and 3."
"10580320","10581660"," Bam right there. "
"10585290","10586750"," It should break right there."
"10587290","10588350"," Bam to the downside."
"10591550","10592910"," Maybe that helps you guys. "
"10600950","10603530"," This one would be up higher, slightly higher."
"10604690","10605970"," Right there."
"10608410","10609690"," Right there. "
"10609690","10610110"," There."
"10610590","10611330"," I mean a little sloppy."
"10612310","10613630"," At least you get the gist, right?"
"10618890","10620630"," There'd be a rule right there. "
"10623470","10624250"," That's right."
"10628170","10629070"," Something like that."
"10631090","10632490"," Bam, bam, bam. "
"10634010","10638030"," That one might be higher, right there."
"10639570","10641590"," It's hard to draw this shit out for you guys."
"10643330","10644590"," Have it look exactly right. "
"10646150","10647290"," It's pretty much what my thoughts are."
"10647590","10648710"," I'm watching this stuff."
"10648870","10649470"," I'm like, yeah, yeah. "
"10649730","10650010"," I'll do that."
"10650950","10652810"," Then there's your bottom target down below."
"10654390","10655090"," Right there. "
"10655810","10674390"," A little bit"
"10674390","10676090"," of flattening going on right now in the 1 minute."
"10676690","10677150"," Right here."
"10677250","10677910"," Let's do the 5 minute. "
"10681050","10682750"," It's 5 minutes right down here."
"10684050","10686470"," I'm trying to take it down below the 5 minute over here."
"10687150","10688130"," 4.40. 97. "
"10707880","10708880"," Time matters here."
"10709800","10711340"," I don't want to see the liquidation break."
"10711340","10713520"," I don't want to see the rule underneath this. "
"10717860","10718920"," Down to Penny right now."
"10728970","10730170"," He's fucking Sellers, man."
"10730390","10732270"," They are just pissy right now. "
"10736770","10738290"," It's beating if I should just add another."
"10739350","10743430"," I'm not going to add any here, but I will add down here."
"10744350","10745630"," I'm not going to add any right now. "
"10745670","10746610"," I'm just down a few pennies."
"10746970","10749650"," If you go down there and then catch a bounce, I'll add to the position right there."
"10749810","10750330"," I'll cut it loose. "
"10750330","10752370"," We break below there permanently."
"10753650","10755050"," It's going to stay right where I'm at."
"10755310","10757570"," Only got 25 contracts on right now, so it's not a big position. "
"10774300","10776380"," So much drama from the sell side, man."
"10777580","10778960"," It's killing me here."
"10783450","10790030"," Nasdaq has a bull plane forming on it on the 15 minute for a major move up. "
"10792150","10794250"," The five minutes get a bull plane as well."
"10794430","10797150"," There should be a check at 15,000, 56, 65."
"10797910","10801370"," So you might roll here briefly, but I'll just add to that position. "
"10802430","10803510"," But I'm extremely bullish here."
"10803750","10805130"," Let's just show you Nasdaq really quick."
"10809290","10810510"," Why am I buying this?"
"10819140","10819920"," It's right here. "
"10820460","10821780"," Just this five minute chart right here."
"10829350","10832910"," This is a bull cross right here."
"10833670","10834950"," Let's see this line come down. "
"10837310","10839830"," And there is the secret right there."
"10842150","10845870"," So just so you can see it, it's right there."
"10849010","10853630"," So what you'll see happen is trend change for some time. "
"10855610","10856210"," Line here."
"10859860","10860780"," Pretty bullish here."
"10864810","10867810"," You should see this last into the close. "
"10870670","10873110"," This is a bull plane on the five minute."
"10873270","10875930"," This is a critical kind of a thing right here."
"10876570","10879010"," There's also a bull plane lower on the 15 minute. "
"10879090","10880770"," The 15 minute chart is not as important as the five."
"10880950","10882530"," Five is critical."
"10884090","10888030"," So even if we pull back down here on Nasdaq, I'm extremely bullish here. "
"10888770","10892810"," Unless this thing rolls over, it's a pretty high win rate."
"10893590","10895470"," It's like now it's at 65%."
"10895470","10901070"," It'll be at 85 here in a few minutes, but this is pretty significant here. "
"10902310","10904370"," The amount of time spent leading up to this."
"10904850","10907730"," I know you guys might think that's a bear flag, but it's actually not."
"10908390","10911170"," It's going to rip some fucking faces off here. "
"10914290","10915410"," I'm long here."
"10915750","10916610"," So that's Nasdaq."
"10917570","10919230"," It's like an HYG really quick. "
"10923660","10926120"," It's looking like it wants to explode to the upside right here."
"10929140","10932060"," Five minutes bull cross right back here."
"10932440","10933760"," So you can actually see it right here. "
"10934060","10934940"," It's a five minute bull cross."
"10935880","10938680"," Come down, touch it, touch it, and explosive moves to the upside."
"10938680","10942560"," And you're seeing that on Nasdaq right now as well. "
"10943500","10943980"," Spy."
"10944780","10949140"," I know all this drama here on Spy."
"10949540","10955100"," I got no love for these bears that are trying to sell this. "
"10955600","10961840"," So whether it happens here, whether it's down and up, or if it's down and up here, it's going up"
"10961840","10962440"," in my view."
"10962440","10966400"," So I added, where did I buy?"
"10968160","10971000"," I bought this bar right here."
"10971460","10972260"," This one I think I bought. "
"10973160","10975480"," And I'll add to the position right here if I have to."
"10975820","10976340"," Either way."
"10979380","10981080"," I'm pretty fucking bullish here. "
"10981320","10982600"," You need an event."
"10984140","10987080"," Something unknown to the market to not be bullish here."
"10995090","10999550"," I'll put another my ad right down where I'll add is right here. "
"10999790","11003490"," Add DCA, whatever you want to call it."
"11006310","11008270"," But I want to get left behind here either."
"11008470","11015590"," So I want to start squeezing up and I'm like didn't buy any of this. "
"11018770","11019910"," So you can see it."
"11021730","11023230"," See that helps you guys out."
"11032280","11034100"," This is where the early trigger is right here. "
"11034560","11037520"," Come on here."
"11046300","11048380"," Hey, Twigy now trading 7440."
"11049200","11050860"," The bears are likely wrong here. "
"11050980","11055980"," I don't know what kind of like noise this is here, but sellers are wrong here in my view."
"11056620","11060180"," You can't have HYG blasting off and spoons not follow along."
"11061640","11062700"," It's going to happen. "
"11062700","11065660"," You're going to also see Nasdaq catch a bit here."
"11066660","11070680"," And outside of all this noise in here, let's send it back up again."
"11070800","11074040"," You actually hear water flame futures, forex and stock instruments. "
"11074900","11077840"," Now VIX has a bear cross coming in on it as well."
"11078620","11080300"," So let's just look at VIX really quick."
"11084370","11086070"," And just so you can see it. "
"11089380","11091140"," Here is the cross on VIX."
"11094280","11095040"," Right there."
"11100800","11102260"," That's a bear plane on VIX. "
"11102600","11105660"," Just needs to do some checking and then it should start plummeting."
"11106900","11108220"," Down here close all that."
"11108340","11110220"," That's why I'm saying bullish in the closing tomorrow. "
"11111120","11117440"," This is setting itself up right now for a major squeeze in the market."
"11117680","11120160"," We'll monitor it if VIX breaks above."
"11121900","11122420"," Reverses. "
"11123540","11124820"," We'll get bearish again."
"11127680","11130640"," Unless that happens right now, it's not set up for that right now."
"11130640","11135380"," It's set up to reject due to this bear plane back here. "
"11138180","11139820"," Giant gap to fill down below."
"11140500","11141640"," It just disappeared."
"11143560","11144900"," The gap was there and now it's not. "
"11147340","11148480"," They just hit that gap."
"11152710","11154170"," One minute chart right here."
"11160790","11162370"," Make sure you keep your eyes on time. "
"11162610","11168090"," It's 12.25. We don't want bears to get a new low on this half an hour."
"11168350","11170170"," So they're going to try to liquidation break this."
"11170810","11172390"," You should see the next five minutes. "
"11172630","11177010"," They're going to try to put a big fat red bar down and catch a close under the half an"
"11177010","11177230"," hour."
"11177230","11180870"," They're going to attempt to right now in the next five minutes."
"11186010","11188070"," We'll see what that does. "
"11190170","11193450"," These sellers, man, they are not happy."
"11193590","11196790"," I don't blame them either because we will run."
"11197310","11198270"," We will run high. "
"11198510","11198670"," Here goes."
"11198870","11199650"," Here's your big red bar."
"11200470","11205690"," I'm going to try to do this between now and 12.30. It's now 12.26. So the next four"
"11205690","11205930"," minutes. "
"11214670","11216110"," Here's your red bar right here."
"11216390","11218150"," You can predict this should have been happening right here."
"11220290","11221910"," Let's see that big red bar right there. "
"11222130","11224570"," They want to get a close underneath this green box."
"11225670","11228490"," Actually, green box is higher right here right now."
"11229670","11234410"," They want to get a closing bar underneath this so they can take it down to the ad right here. "
"11239250","11240690"," 12.27. Three minutes."
"11240850","11242310"," They got the new low though."
"11242970","11245190"," We'll likely see this price down here. "
"11248330","11249490"," I'm still long right now."
"11249570","11250030"," I still got calls."
"11250610","11252070"," I'm going to add to them as soon as we get down here. "
"11266330","11269390"," This seller, man, these sellers are so pissed right now."
"11270430","11271390"," Like in their view, man."
"11271490","11273870"," Well, if you're a bear out there, this is the place to short the market. "
"11274550","11278210"," Or if you're traditionally charting, it's your place to short the market."
"11281320","11283620"," In their view, this is their place to short the market."
"11284440","11289420"," I'm not on that same thought process. "
"11289620","11292280"," I think this is their trap, not their time to shine today."
"11294060","11294560"," Here I go."
"11294680","11295800"," I'm going to go in and buy another 25. "
"11302380","11303280"," Hold on here."
"11303280","11304000"," Silver botany."
"11305940","11307420"," See that revenge right there?"
"11308140","11308820"," Anger, man. "
"11309580","11310220"," A pure seller."
"11310480","11310620"," Anger."
"11311540","11313080"," I'm going to buy 50, not 25. "
"11314640","11315460"," Hold on here."
"11321810","11325690"," Just added another, just added 50 at $0.14. Hold on here."
"11327710","11329590"," His pissed off bears, dude. "
"11331610","11332290"," Pissed off."
"11332630","11346230"," I just added more right here at $0.14. Now trading $0.17. Angry"
"11346230","11347270"," fucking sellers, dude."
"11347490","11347830"," Like anger. "
"11348830","11349250"," Pure anger."
"11366040","11367720"," There's our early trigger right here."
"11368360","11369080"," So you can see it. "
"11369180","11372140"," I was piloting a digital reboot on real customers in August."
"11391430","11394810"," They need this closing bar underneath this red line right here."
"11394890","11396330"," You can see that right there. "
"11402580","11404320"," Dude, straight anger, man."
"11406340","11413280"," I swear it's like a bunch of like Macau monkeys or something just slinging shit down there."
"11417860","11419220"," Just rage. "
"11419700","11422980"," See how emotional this is?"
"11423120","11425320"," It's like pure emotions right here."
"11429080","11430460"," They know they're getting trapped."
"11432680","11433160"," Anger. "
"11449650","11453910"," 25 at $0.32.75 at $0.75. I think I got them."
"11454010","11454750"," I don't know what I got them at."
"11454830","11456330"," I think $0.11 or something insane. "
"11466120","11467260"," Just look at that right there."
"11467500","11467980"," Just rage."
"11469640","11472520"," They have, they are forced into buying all this right here. "
"11473500","11474600"," And they sold it all."
"11475780","11477100"," It's all pissed off they are."
"11479580","11484060"," It's like a hedge fund somewhere in Hoboken, New Jersey forced to buy all this. "
"11484200","11486140"," This probably is Carl Eichen."
"11488380","11492160"," Carl Eichen is sitting in his back office and he's like, God damn I got to buy all this."
"11493020","11494620"," It throws down like $50 million. "
"11497360","11499900"," Sitting in his office, sitting in the Hamptons right now on vacation."
"11502200","11504160"," He's watching the show right now."
"11509140","11513830"," He's like some punk asshole from Detroit. "
"11516220","11517350"," I'll show that guy."
"11517970","11528450"," Oh, yeah,"
"11528630","11528850"," baby."
"11528950","11530430"," Trade 20 cents right now. "
"11531510","11533270"," Come on to daddy."
"11534890","11536490"," That's kind of the place where I show."
"11536630","11541210"," I'm probably up right now significantly just because of the shared number of calls that I have, but"
"11541210","11545370"," I still don't believe these fucking sellers, man. "
"11545590","11547210"," I don't fucking believe these guys."
"11549350","11551790"," I'm not on the cell train here at all."
"11551950","11553070"," I'm looking at it right now in the background. "
"11555430","11557110"," Nice rotation into IWM."
"11557650","11560050"," These sellers, man, are trapped right here."
"11560630","11561730"," And they don't know it yet. "
"11561890","11562870"," I don't think that they know it."
"11562910","11565070"," This is kind of where you have the edge over these people."
"11565870","11569770"," You kind of know when the sellers are in charge and you know when the sellers are not in charge. "
"11570450","11573550"," Not all sellers know when they're not in charge."
"11574270","11575690"," So they're thinking right here."
"11575790","11576850"," They're going to get a reversal. "
"11577850","11578690"," They're going to try."
"11578910","11579750"," They're going to get their office."
"11579870","11582690"," Some guy in an office right now is going to give it their all to sell this down. "
"11583610","11585530"," But I don't think they're in charge right here."
"11585570","11588310"," I think that they're out of charge or whatever you call that."
"11590710","11593510"," So I'm not on team sell right now on this. "
"11593730","11599110"," Now if it does, I will cut loose because we will go back down to this early trigger down here."
"11599770","11601550"," They're going to attempt to do that."
"11601550","11603970"," But this looks like it's all emotional to me. "
"11603970","11605250"," It all looks emotional here."
"11607130","11608730"," And they don't like what they're seeing."
"11609570","11610750"," So still long here. "
"11611270","11612250"," Now I have a hundred contracts."
"11614510","11616450"," I'm telling you what, man, they're pissed off."
"11616870","11621890"," I don't blame them for being pissed off here because you know where it's going, right?"
"11622110","11622550"," It's going up. "
"11622950","11625590"," And it's going to go up probably today, tomorrow."
"11626410","11629870"," And then we get another rollover tomorrow, I think."
"11631010","11633510"," So get another roll coming, supposedly. "
"11636710","11641530"," I don't know if that's on CPI or PPI or what's going to make that happen."
"11641710","11642930"," But there's likely one more roll."
"11654160","11657660"," Maybe that's a failure to close the previous high above again. "
"11660220","11665300"," I was looking at the Algo McAlgo face and it said two green bars."
"11665300","11668540"," We should have two days up and then three more days down."
"11669660","11671540"," So today would be one of those days. "
"11673640","11676820"," And then tomorrow would be the last update."
"11681800","11684960"," But in the meantime, man, these fucking sellers do, they don't care."
"11685220","11685740"," They're pissed. "
"11686780","11689420"," You can, this is an angry trade right here."
"11689420","11694740"," So according to a survey, a proportion of traditional hedge funds investing in crypto assets falls"
"11694740","11696440"," to 29% versus."
"11696640","11700100"," Yeah, buyers are buyers are above the early triggers. "
"11700380","11704560"," As long as buyers are above the early trigger, I am bullish here."
"11704680","11706860"," So they need to get underneath this right here."
"11707660","11708400"," One second. "
"11708840","11710620"," So see this yellow box right here."
"11712800","11714600"," They have to get underneath this."
"11714600","11717000"," Clean this up or make it bigger. "
"11719720","11721460"," So just for your own."
"11727500","11729500"," So I want you to know, right?"
"11729940","11732320"," So if we, if price was under."
"11734200","11735900"," Price was under this, right?"
"11737340","11738940"," And the white and the red run to this. "
"11740060","11741520"," You'd be selling the rip."
"11741720","11742360"," Does that make sense?"
"11743040","11745440"," So like selling the rip down here."
"11747400","11751480"," Price below the hourly below the one and the five, right?"
"11752300","11753680"," You'd be a seller. "
"11753900","11754520"," Sell every rip."
"11755480","11760460"," When price is above the early trigger, you're a buyer of all dips."
"11761200","11762040"," Anything like this. "
"11763160","11763880"," That nonsense."
"11764460","11764920"," And that drama."
"11765640","11766280"," Any of this stuff. "
"11766980","11768040"," You're a buyer of dips."
"11768420","11769080"," And they're not in charge."
"11769700","11770620"," They might think they are. "
"11771080","11772380"," But they're not in charge."
"11772680","11773800"," Sellers are not in charge."
"11774020","11775160"," Now I know where they are. "
"11775400","11776300"," I know they're up here."
"11776720","11778300"," I know that they were over here."
"11779020","11780420"," And they go over and right?"
"11780600","11783980"," They go over and because we're by the dip mode, not sell the rip mode. "
"11784460","11788420"," So you get sellers like finally trying to sell this down as hard as they can."
"11788520","11789160"," Just right now."
"11789220","11789700"," Same thing. "
"11790440","11792340"," Just that's a violent move right here."
"11795780","11797280"," And they're up here, right?"
"11797500","11799480"," The big boy sellers are up here."
"11800000","11801440"," They're not fucking around. "
"11801840","11804920"," Like they don't want to be over run because when they get over run, right?"
"11805620","11807520"," And the longer we, this is what I point yesterday."
"11807520","11813920"," I wanted to make was, I don't know if I made this point yesterday, but sellers had time to sell."
"11814460","11814580"," Okay. "
"11815980","11817240"," So here, let me show you guys some."
"11817520","11817660"," So."
"11822780","11823180"," Time. "
"11823360","11824340"," It's an important thing."
"11825240","11825640"," So."
"11826800","11828420"," Sellers had back from ready. "
"11828700","11829540"," I'm going to show you both times."
"11829540","11831120"," Sellers are up here, right?"
"11831620","11833440"," This is fucking June 15th."
"11834560","11835740"," They sold it down. "
"11836920","11838760"," We found demand on the daily trigger."
"11839720","11842080"," Came back up and retested the high up here, right?"
"11842900","11844940"," Sellers came in again, slammed it down."
"11845840","11847740"," So I want to be like crystal clear here. "
"11848660","11849240"," They're here."
"11850640","11851160"," Right?"
"11851460","11852680"," They're told, fuck you know."
"11853740","11858360"," So we come back again to this high and sellers go, you shall not pass, right?"
"11858360","11859280"," You shall not pass. "
"11859460","11860140"," You shall not pass."
"11861000","11868640"," You know, sellers need, I need, sellers need, and spy just change the direction today."
"11869180","11870760"," So technically we've changed direction. "
"11871160","11871620"," This is new."
"11871820","11872660"," This is actually new."
"11873440","11875900"," Today, just at this moment, we've changed direction. "
"11876340","11876500"," So."
"11877620","11878800"," Maybe you can't see this."
"11878920","11879160"," Hold on. "
"11880800","11881920"," Let me show you this here."
"11882220","11882420"," So."
"11882420","11885580"," Let me just see this here. "
"11885700","11889260"," So sellers come in and they're like, you're not going any higher, right?"
"11889580","11890160"," More supply."
"11891180","11892160"," Above, right?"
"11893200","11898380"," So we trade down to the DT and you find that buyers show up."
"11898980","11899240"," Okay. "
"11900420","11905240"," So we come back up here and sellers are like still fucking cranky pants."
"11906060","11907780"," I got subscriptions to sell."
"11908940","11910200"," I want a better price. "
"11910200","11912680"," I know we're going up, but this isn't the price I want."
"11913020","11913620"," I'm crying."
"11914020","11915940"," I couldn't buy it down here and pissed off. "
"11916420","11917860"," I wanted it for 20."
"11926470","11927290"," Going on vacation."
"11928750","11929890"," Come back on vacation. "
"11931410","11932690"," And what did you get?"
"11934270","11934710"," 438."
"11936230","11939890"," And you got dumb fucking bulls are like, fuck, you know, we're not done, right?"
"11941490","11942530"," Same thing right here."
"11942670","11943670"," Fuck, you know, we're not done. "
"11945770","11949330"," It's in a series of higher lows, higher lows."
"11951370","11956590"," And these sellers, man, like they, like, they don't fucking care."
"11958230","11961370"," They want this bloodbath down here so they can get there for 20. "
"11962210","11963730"," They can get it, I guess."
"11964010","11965330"," Get a bad CPI or something."
"11967030","11969830"," We are due for a bloodbath. "
"11970030","11970770"," I'll agree with that too."
"11970770","11973950"," But price action rules."
"11977350","11980110"," And we have something else happening here. "
"11980450","11982690"," We have time spent."
"11984250","11987130"," We didn't just squeeze up and over and come back down."
"11987810","11989950"," We have time being spent on this hourly. "
"11990950","11994150"," When you're seeing this here, you're seeing seller rage."
"11995390","11998370"," These sellers are up here trying to sell the market."
"11998830","11999810"," Let's see them right here. "
"12004010","12005770"," See that pin strike right there?"
"12008130","12009350"," Let's see them right up in here."
"12010870","12012330"," Here, we'll even raise it a little bit."
"12012570","12013330"," Let's see them right here. "
"12014010","12014770"," Let's see them right here."
"12015090","12015710"," Let's even raise it up."
"12016250","12017010"," And they're going to do it again. "
"12018590","12019890"," Another asshole up here."
"12020070","12020450"," And he's like."
"12023130","12025470"," He's like, all right, we'll sell this one then, right?"
"12025750","12026150"," You got him saying?"
"12026150","12028910"," And the problem here is that you've got momentum. "
"12031350","12033370"," You're above momentum right now."
"12033650","12035470"," And they couldn't sell you down just then."
"12036010","12037210"," So they do a check, right?"
"12037770","12038270"," Slant it down. "
"12039070","12041190"," See if they can get underneath and start selling this market."
"12041430","12041910"," And they can't."
"12041970","12043950"," There's demand right here. "
"12045090","12048190"," There's buyers here stepping in and saying, no, we're not done."
"12048950","12049450"," We're going up."
"12050550","12054270"," And we're going to squeeze this thing up and over right there. "
"12054270","12055070"," Makes sense?"
"12055650","12060970"," And they don't want to see this happen because if that happens, they're going to be run over."
"12061070","12062650"," They have to buy the market, right?"
"12062770","12063890"," They have to buy the market."
"12064550","12066070"," And they're pretty pissed off about it. "
"12066250","12070530"," So you're going to get emotional, like you're going to get emotional, like slam the sell button."
"12072290","12073390"," We're selling this."
"12074190","12084030"," Now, I would give this to sellers up here because you see the hourly"
"12084030","12084250"," fee. "
"12084250","12085190"," It's flattening out, right?"
"12085710","12089870"," I give it to the sellers over here because you see the hourly going down."
"12090330","12091590"," See it's going down, right?"
"12091850","12092810"," So I'm going to give this to the sellers."
"12093310","12095170"," Yeah, sellers are probably doing the right thing. "
"12095430","12097930"," Yeah, sellers probably won't hold up here."
"12098610","12099970"," Those green lines going down."
"12100210","12105870"," But the moment that you start seeing this green fucking line starting to come up and price is"
"12105870","12109770"," starting to hold above it, it's starting to tell you that they're fucking wrong. "
"12110590","12112630"," And they're going to fucking squeeze this thing."
"12113710","12118010"," So, you know, that 446 up there, that 444 right there, that 443."
"12119810","12121230"," It's telling you a different story. "
"12121450","12122810"," This is the edge that you need to have."
"12123490","12126570"," Because if you didn't have the screen line, you'd be like, and you didn't have velocity in your"
"12126570","12127450"," side, you wouldn't know."
"12127810","12136530"," If you're a seller in your view as a seller, this looks like a perfect setup to trade, you know,"
"12136630","12137630"," the gap down below here. "
"12138710","12139650"," So bloodbath is down."
"12140010","12141050"," Now, can they get this down here?"
"12141050","12141390"," Sure."
"12142430","12144230"," But does it look like they're going to get it?"
"12144470","12144610"," Fuck. "
"12144810","12145490"," No, it doesn't."
"12146230","12147510"," And I don't know why they're trying."
"12148350","12153290"," Trying to figure out, trying to scratch my head here and find out why they think it's that bot"
"12153290","12153590"," here. "
"12153910","12154510"," Add it again."
"12155590","12160170"," Now, if they do get down here, I'm watching the time right now."
"12160230","12162070"," So it's 11, 1242. "
"12163390","12165110"," They got three more minutes to get a new high."
"12165210","12166270"," We'll see if they can catch it."
"12166930","12172190"," They need a new high in the next three minutes, and then they need another high and another low in"
"12172190","12172830"," 15 minutes. "
"12173470","12176750"," Here's their previous low right here, 1229."
"12177810","12182050"," Next 15 minutes, we'll see if they can get that low, a new low, if they need to go down"
"12182050","12182290"," here."
"12183510","12185590"," In the next minute or so, they need to go down here. "
"12186050","12188110"," And then the next 15 minutes, they need to go down here."
"12188970","12190450"," So they don't have a lot of time on their side."
"12190630","12192330"," They have to make this happen right now. "
"12192990","12196010"," So they have to start selling aggressively and hard."
"12196910","12198990"," If they can't do it, we're going to go up."
"12200110","12200870"," We'll see what happens. "
"12201130","12202570"," We'll see if they get that sell down."
"12202910","12205270"," If you are long right here, just be careful to have some stops."
"12206130","12207510"," You don't want to get caught in this. "
"12207990","12208890"," I'm long still."
"12209130","12209570"," I'm not selling."
"12210190","12212390"," I'm not on the seller's side on this. "
"12212970","12214050"," They could sell this down though."
"12214830","12216990"," The next 15 minutes or so, next 16 minutes."
"12217210","12218810"," I'm not on seller's side personally though. "
"12220850","12222570"," I see HYG going up."
"12222690","12223570"," I think they're fucking lying."
"12224250","12226610"," So they're pissed off and some sell. "
"12226790","12229730"," There are some hedge funds right now that are raging pissed."
"12230830","12231810"," Absolutely raging pissed."
"12231990","12233130"," They'll claim that they're not. "
"12233150","12234310"," They'll say we bought the market."
"12234770","12236430"," But you can see right here, they sold it."
"12237450","12238330"," And anger. "
"12238630","12239210"," Pure anger."
"12240710","12240750"," So."
"12246880","12250080"," Yeah, they're pretty angry right here. "
"12251460","12252780"," They're pretty angry."
"12253240","12254760"," They're the whole thesis here, right?"
"12257800","12260440"," I'm watching Dixie here, but they're watching Dixie going."
"12260600","12261580"," Yeah, Dixie's going to explode. "
"12262240","12263600"," Meanwhile, HYG is going north."
"12264020","12268820"," So HYG is just powering new high after new high after new high."
"12269480","12276720"," I don't know what the assumption here is that you're going to let Dixie go north here. "
"12276720","12279320"," And yet, sell the market, I guess."
"12279580","12280080"," I don't know."
"12281800","12282280"," Maybe. "
"12283580","12287640"," If you're not inputs on the market, this is the place to put them on."
"12288780","12293000"," If you don't have monthly puts yet or whatever, if you haven't jumped on that train at all, this is"
"12293000","12293920"," where I am right up here."
"12294540","12295020"," So. "
"12296680","12302920"," I'm not right here, but this is my, this is my like on a spy right here."
"12308880","12310600"," So this is Ryan up here."
"12310720","12312220"," So I'm all the way up here. "
"12312800","12313580"," At any point."
"12315120","12316380"," We trade up here."
"12316940","12318140"," Start doing this shit. "
"12319000","12319940"," I have to close."
"12320320","12322480"," I can't stay in monthly puts."
"12323160","12324880"," We go up there in any way, shape or form. "
"12325420","12326920"," So these sellers are pests."
"12327400","12328840"," This is their whole thing, man."
"12331080","12332420"," They're teeing off spot. "
"12341820","12342640"," Same place."
"12342640","12344860"," This early trigger was down here earlier today."
"12344940","12348180"," Sponsored by to the tick right down here is where the early trigger was. "
"12348440","12351400"," And market profile levels by signing up."
"12351760","12352470"," To the 1245."
"12353120","12355040"," You see them trying to get their new low right now. "
"12367030","12383710"," Yeah, I'm"
"12383710","12384770"," on this squeeze up."
"12385030","12385950"," I'm on this."
"12386290","12388410"," I don't know necessarily if. "
"12389850","12391450"," CPI will be good."
"12392890","12395170"," I think I might be flat for CPI."
"12397450","12400450"," I'm game to like trade this up into the bell. "
"12401410","12405050"," And then be flat for CPI."
"12405490","12406430"," I was chewing on it."
"12408590","12410610"," I'm like, like some tournament brain. "
"12410870","12416570"," I'm like, uh, do we do we get a good CPI rip up and then sell the open or something?"
"12424830","12425850"," Hey, thanks, Matthew."
"12434850","12435750"," Target for puts."
"12435930","12437490"," I've got four twenty P's. "
"12438430","12440310"," I think they're for August 10th."
"12440510","12442350"," Four twenties and four thirty twos."
"12444410","12447890"," I've been holding them since last week or something like that two weeks ago. "
"12452810","12453990"," I want to see."
"12454570","12456170"," I want to see four twenty."
"12456570","12462350"," I want to see four twenties. "
"12462970","12463990"," I want to see four twenty hit."
"12465190","12466610"," I want that tip as well."
"12467010","12468730"," I want like, I want like the weakness. "
"12469870","12473090"," Into the fifteenth and then the nineteen twenty first."
"12473790","12476230"," And then I want the run the real run to begin."
"12477350","12478570"," For the quarter then. "
"12479330","12482910"," Now if they try to front run this quarter for like the weak fall bullshit."
"12483490","12484970"," Maybe they just keep running it up."
"12485590","12487270"," So if we begin to trade over this. "
"12488750","12491510"," We begin to break out then I'll close them out."
"12497120","12498460"," Live cattle blasting off."
"12499060","12503950"," Yeah, you do want to see the. "
"12504170","12504890"," Yeah, you see that."
"12505650","12507110"," There's a whole other story going on."
"12507250","12509030"," Like a try G can't fucking be screaming. "
"12509890","12511050"," Higher and you not see."
"12512950","12514150"," Spoons and fucking."
"12514610","12516090"," Risk on appetites. "
"12516570","12518370"," Risk on should be blasting right now."
"12518410","12520830"," So this is all fucking drama in my view."
"12521650","12522130"," So. "
"12523990","12529880"," I think you did you bought two hundred twenty shares of."
"12530460","12531800"," Of calm yesterday."
"12534140","12536140"," I was shocked at the price of eggs coming down. "
"12537580","12539160"," Say a big one right there, right?"
"12539320","12540820"," I'm assuming that someone was like."
"12541420","12543560"," Can somebody please get the price of eggs down."
"12543700","12544920"," They won't stop talking about it. "
"12545600","12547640"," We want the price of to use cars and houses."
"12547900","12548720"," Fuck that shit."

"12554460","12558640"," I'd like to trade I'd like to trade this today."
"12560220","12564300"," And then exit the clothes and be flat for CPI."
"12565060","12567280"," And if I miss the squeeze up, I'll take the. "
"12567720","12568620"," I'll take the."
"12569540","12572560"," I'll take the trade like I'll take the bounce back or something."
"12575320","12578860"," I don't like that CPI has been good for bulls. "
"12579380","12581060"," And I'm like yeah, just this one time."
"12581720","12585400"," I'm like just that one like every four months roll it down."

"12800370","12802110"," You could like get yourself a fight."
"12802250","12806810"," If I didn't have kids, just get an RV man and go like anywhere you want."
"12806990","12809790"," And then know you have a place to come back to that you always own. "
"12810770","12815650"," And the cool part is if you're like, well, I can't do this or I feel like I'm spinning my"

"12825710","12827130"," I didn't want to buy in an RV."
"12827910","12829190"," And I parked it in the backyard. "
"12830030","12832290"," And I lived in it while I fixed up house."
"12832930","12834730"," And I got temporary power to the RV."
"12835450","12838250"," Hooked up the shitter down into the, into the waste pipe. "
"12838290","12839770"," Remember I was talking about the hose, right?"
"12840230","12843090"," You run the water down, make sure the drain lines are legit."
"12845270","12848790"," And then you, uh, I'm taking a lot of money right now."
"12852430","12861490"," And then, um, and then,"
"12861490","12867830"," um, so you can do that. "
"12867830","12870770"," And it's fun and you get to build something."

"12989530","12990810"," You want to go to New York and fly there. "
"12990890","12991990"," You want to go to LA and fly there."
"12992070","12993110"," You want to go to San Diego and fly there."
"12996310","12997350"," You want to go skiing?"
"12997690","12997890"," Fly. "
"13021320","13025000"," Yeah, Cosmoda is saying, Jim, just want to say, you've changed my life forever these past few"
"13025000","13025200"," months."
"13025460","13026860"," I have my first baby on the way in December."
"13027460","13029020"," You've taken a huge weight off our family's shoulders. "
"13029300","13029660"," Right on, brother."
"13029980","13030460"," Appreciate that."
"13040510","13042430"," The calls are bouncing around right now. "
"13043070","13044710"," They were 29 cents at one point."
"13047030","13047970"," I grabbed off."
"13048290","13050650"," I grabbed like 75 of them dirt fucking cheap. "
"13052190","13057570"," I had some for 32 as well, but the cheap ones, the cheapies, ran those right over, so."
"13058330","13060110"," So you can catch us into the close here."
"13060830","13062110"," You know the sellers are up here. "
"13062730","13065050"," Try to do a hit and run operation back here."
"13065470","13066690"," Add it to this down below."
"13071570","13072610"," Bouncing around now. "
"13072710","13076750"," Let me know in the chat what you guys are thinking for 4 p.m. or for tomorrow."
"13077010","13079830"," As a matter of fact, it's 1 p.m. right now."
"13080450","13083390"," So let's take a look at what to expect the rest of the week. "
"13084790","13086090"," I'm going to take a quick break here."
"13086150","13086810"," Probably go to the bathroom."
"13086810","13088570"," I'm going to hold my calls and sound them. "
"13091730","13093450"," Let's take a look at the rest of the week though."
"13094930","13097250"," Let's take a look at a 5 minute chart."
"13100850","13104510"," Give you guys some perspective where we actually are. "
"13107270","13108250"," Okay, so."
"13110970","13112930"," We know the sellers are up here, right?"
"13113190","13114650"," We had the STX sell back here."
"13114650","13115970"," Can't see it, but. "
"13116890","13118150"," We had the STX sell."
"13118270","13118670"," I remember that."
"13121390","13123310"," And since then what has been doing right?"
"13123550","13124430"," Selling, selling, selling. "
"13125230","13127710"," We found buyers down below here, right?"
"13129050","13130290"," Buyers stepped in."
"13134580","13136480"," Came right in down here."
"13137720","13140100"," And they said fuck you, right?"
"13141340","13143060"," We're not done going down. "
"13143300","13144180"," Now sell side."
"13147060","13148020"," What's going on here?"
"13149280","13150100"," What's going on?"
"13150800","13151480"," Sell side."
"13151860","13154460"," Their idea is that this is only a relief rally. "
"13155700","13156180"," Demand."
"13157940","13159640"," Sellers, sellers, sellers."
"13161240","13162280"," Attempting to sell again. "
"13162980","13164820"," Surely expecting these three-year note options."
"13165200","13166220"," I'll leave it with a bit to cover."
"13167380","13169840"," You get a good CPI, right?"
"13170980","13173140"," Slam up here, new high, off and running, right?"
"13174300","13175640"," Sellers don't want to see that happen. "
"13175640","13179320"," And, you know, they want to sell this down right now."
"13179560","13181040"," They don't even want to see this happen today."
"13181600","13182240"," Sell it down. "
"13183140","13184020"," Squeeze this up."
"13184120","13185280"," You get a bad CPR report."
"13185440","13186520"," We bloodbath it again, right?"
"13187680","13189060"," Take it right back down here. "
"13189640","13194660"," Sellers also are looking for this lower low down here."
"13197760","13198200"," Right?"
"13198940","13201340"," Close all this up now and you see all this here."
"13202060","13203180"," They want this down here. "
"13203300","13204260"," You see my cursor down here?"
"13204260","13206520"," I'm going to close this gap next, right?"
"13207440","13220040"," Your daily trigger is now on the spy at $4.34.48. So"
"13220040","13221040"," they've actually come up."
"13223600","13226260"," So your daily trigger has come up right now."
"13226660","13230600"," Treasury when issued three-year-year-year-old, four-spot, five, three, six percent before the $40"
"13230600","13231420"," billion auction. "
"13231780","13233120"," It's kind of important here, right?"
"13233820","13239100"," So this daily trigger, this daily trigger right here is kind of important, right?"
"13239660","13240120"," Moving up."
"13240280","13240700"," It's moving up."
"13241420","13241900"," It's moving up. "
"13242000","13242440"," It's moving up."
"13242540","13243260"," It's moving up, right?"
"13244180","13249640"," It's kind of the only way that the thing you need to think about here is if we squeeze up,"
"13249640","13251220"," right?"
"13252240","13253960"," Daily trigger will just keep on marching, right?"
"13257580","13262460"," If you can catch a bad CPR report, you can actually trade down below here."
"13263380","13265060"," This is what a bear would want to see. "
"13265440","13268960"," They'd want to see CPI come in hot."
"13270060","13271040"," Or I don't know."
"13271140","13275820"," Maybe the CPI comes in low and you're going to be like, this shit blows my mind. "
"13276060","13277940"," Like CPI comes in hot."
"13278220","13278660"," Oh, my God."
"13278780","13280200"," The Fed's going to have to raise rates. "
"13280940","13287540"," It's bizarre because even if they do raise rates, that's actually bullish, not bearish."
"13288020","13292980"," It's when they don't raise rates anymore, at some point it'll become extremely bearish."
"13293920","13296520"," But I think maybe sellers are hoping for that. "
"13296740","13297940"," Like you get that hot CPI."
"13298980","13306740"," Read, you're able to get underneath the hourly trigger, the known buyers and the daily trigger."
"13306840","13308660"," It's a lot for a seller to get through. "
"13309240","13311860"," This is a lot of work for a seller right now."
"13312080","13314140"," A lot of traditional charters don't see this."
"13315300","13316480"," There's a ton of work here. "
"13317020","13319340"," Starting to form a base that's monster for bulls."
"13320760","13329720"," So if you're a sell side, I want you to know that you need to get underneath 434-44 to"
"13329720","13331640"," make any meaningful."
"13332540","13334120"," And tomorrow it'll be 435. "
"13335120","13341400"," So basically if you're a sell side, right, you're a seller and you're a bear, you need to get"
"13341400","13342000"," underneath this."
"13343400","13347520"," And for you to target for 20."
"13347520","13353040"," 88 to 88 and a high yield of 4 spot 534 percent, 4 spot 534 percent. "
"13353460","13359080"," So the US selling $40 billion of three-year notes and awards 20 spot 1 9% of bids at"
"13359080","13359280"," high."
"13359640","13365140"," So primary deal is taking 10 spots, 7 8% direct staking 19 spots, 7 9% and indirect taking"
"13365140","13367720"," 69 spot 49 for 3%."
"13367720","13370000"," So you can see this right here, right?"
"13370180","13372300"," There's no support here, no support down here. "
"13372780","13375160"," Like you literally need to get underneath this."
"13376080","13378380"," Boom to break down and take that 420."
"13379020","13381960"," And this is not looking good for you right now. "
"13382360","13383820"," This is not looking good for you."
"13384040","13387920"," So not looking good."
"13388700","13393500"," This daily trigger coming up the way that it is, price being above the hourly trigger right now,"
"13394000","13394920"," not looking good. "
"13396660","13401760"," So my expectations into tomorrow, there's that big burr up there, maybe Valhalla."
"13403100","13409900"," My expectations into tomorrow for CPI is an upside target."
"13415990","13417110"," 443 65. "
"13418690","13425610"," Unless we get some kind of bad news and upside target up here for CPI."
"13426130","13427730"," And I think CPI is going to come down."
"13427970","13428470"," I think it's going to be good. "
"13430630","13436510"," I don't know if this gets, we go there today, sell the news or we get the good, maybe we"
"13436510","13440210"," bleed off down here at 8 30 and then boom, we finally go over and up."
"13441430","13444970"," Or we come up here, then we squeeze up and over on the opening bell."
"13446110","13448250"," I think your CPI report is good. "
"13449170","13451430"," I heard some of this morning say front running CPI."
"13451870","13452830"," I don't know if that's the case."
"13456130","13459930"," Because the hourly trigger and the daily trigger are telling you a different story. "
"13461370","13465710"," So bears are not hoping to pray right now."
"13466210","13468190"," Bears need some bad fucking news."
"13469050","13469790"," Like they need it. "
"13470530","13474890"," Now, historically and statistically, they're going to get it."
"13475330","13476130"," Some bad news."
"13477210","13479130"," So that's my only concern here. "
"13479130","13486430"," So I would like to be a buyer here into the clothes personally and then just be flat into tomorrow."
"13486830","13490830"," And it's on a wild shot or wild card."
"13491670","13492910"," Yeah, baby, give me money. "
"13493370","13496590"," So every."
"13500620","13503900"," And every bull run, every single one."
"13506540","13508880"," About three or four times a year. "
"13510960","13513800"," You'll get a major pullback on some news."
"13516000","13518300"," That catches everybody off guard."
"13519300","13521160"," CPI could be it. "
"13524430","13525370"," Could be."
"13527470","13530290"," You have like one hot report or something."
"13532290","13535870"," Could be it could be a rate hike. "
"13537270","13541940"," There is a little bit of like."
"13542240","13543260"," I want to call it."
"13543380","13544380"," Yeah, it's kind of tail risk. "
"13545020","13548280"," It's kind of like quarterly or yearly tail risk."
"13549160","13552040"," But even then I'm still bullish even if it happens."
"13552620","13552800"," So. "
"13554160","13559260"," If we roll down there to 420 on some bullshit news, it is a buy."
"13560600","13566500"," It is a like full port mortgage house, sell the kids, sell the dogs, buy it."
"13566500","13568900"," And we are due for one of those. "
"13569100","13573000"," So that's the one quarter I'm going to give to the bears and sellers here."
"13573620","13575160"," Sellers have any argument."
"13577460","13582040"," It is that you're due for some kind of a pullback on bullshit. "
"13584760","13590200"," And it's likely just a bank that wants a better price and truthfully in my view."
"13590960","13591700"," It's that simple."
"13593820","13596000"," So that's my take for tomorrow. "
"13596580","13599320"," Until that until that until that until that news."
"13599480","13601640"," I'm expecting upward backwards move into tomorrow."
"13602500","13608400"," And then I'm going to give it most of my most of my. "
"13610760","13614640"," Many of the high probability to a really good CPI number."
"13615440","13617980"," Tomorrow as well, but there is some tail risk."
"13617980","13619260"," There's like I have to tell you that. "
"13620480","13622500"," If it were to roll over hard and heavy."
"13623380","13626840"," At eight thirty tomorrow morning on some kind of hot report that was unexpected."
"13627880","13630280"," Could just be a fucking scam to get a better price. "
"13631240","13632260"," And be honest with you."
"13634740","13635260"," Now."
"13636800","13641960"," If we reverse to the upside, if we get a good report and we start trading above that four forty"
"13641960","13642220"," four. "
"13642660","13647260"," And we begin to make our leg higher on your bear."
"13648160","13651660"," You have to concede and we're going to take it higher at that point."
"13653060","13654820"," It can get nasty to the upside. "
"13656640","13657940"," But I see what I see."
"13658140","13660680"," I see it's like I see the idea of."
"13663880","13667750"," See the idea of some kind of a."
"13671100","13672300"," Actually added down here. "
"13675160","13676880"," I see the like I see."
"13677840","13681520"," When you have when we're constantly going up constantly going up every dip is bought."
"13681660","13682360"," Every dip is bought. "
"13682600","13687760"," There's usually every three months or so every sometimes it takes four months."
"13690740","13694660"," There's usually like some kind of bullshit and we sell."
"13700600","13703120"," So there and the longer the time passes. "
"13704000","13705860"," The more risk that becomes."
"13706440","13707920"," So if we don't have it tomorrow."
"13708560","13710820"," Like you start like we wait a week. "
"13710940","13711760"," We wait two weeks."
"13712420","13714060"," We had another three weeks four weeks."
"13714180","13715960"," It just becomes apparent that it's going to happen. "
"13719600","13721100"," Just the law of probabilities."
"13724540","13729480"," The only thing that I would recommend if that if and when that happens is don't drink the Kool-Aid."
"13730860","13734140"," Because there'll be a lot of Kool-Aid passed around when that happens. "
"13735960","13741200"," Like we're market crash market doom all this stuff and in reality it's just a bank trying to get a"
"13741200","13741620"," good price."
"13741780","13746480"," So whenever that is whenever that happens don't drink the Kool-Aid."
"13747080","13749460"," Be tactful sell it down. "
"13750320","13752320"," Buy the dip and move on."
"13753680","13756340"," The reason I say that too is because."
"13757260","13759560"," A couple times in my history. "
"13760240","13763560"," I have drank that Kool-Aid in this exact situation."
"13765640","13772200"," And we sold it down and I was told it was going to crash by people I trusted."
"13773420","13776760"," And there was panic everywhere and we didn't. "
"13777380","13782000"," So be conscious of that if this if it happens this week."
"13782640","13783720"," Next month."
"13785000","13788380"," Next week 21st 19th if that happens. "
"13788940","13792420"," I'm going to pre warn you to remember this video please."
"13795890","13797130"," Don't drink the Kool-Aid."
"13798050","13801010"," I've lost six figures drinking that Kool-Aid in a bull market. "
"13801610","13805410"," And it's the disaster I gave away so much money."
"13806570","13808530"," And they were selling into me."
"13808970","13812230"," So that was like full fucking port short. "
"13813190","13816770"," So like we get down there and bounce on 420 or something like that at any point."
"13818010","13820010"," Just fucking buy the dip."
"13822470","13823850"," They're lying to you. "
"13827070","13828750"," They're fucking lying to you."
"13831800","13832800"," Oh yeah dude."
"13833260","13834040"," Oh man dude. "
"13835600","13838300"," Like we're in a bull run whether you like it or not."
"13838500","13839100"," That's what we're in."
"13839440","13843660"," And we should have three about three big rollovers in a year. "
"13846060","13850440"," But every one of those in a bull run people are like markets going to crash right here."
"13850440","13851560"," And it's not."
"13852480","13854460"," There's like zero indication of it. "
"13854560","13856600"," And of course like by the second or third one."
"13857100","13858880"," That's how I would get caught in these fucking things."
"13859580","13861440"," Like the first couple I would buy the dip. "
"13862280","13864140"," And then by like the third one."
"13864880","13866220"," I'd be like one of these are going to break."
"13866820","13868340"," I mean this is the third one right now. "
"13868480","13871200"," I'm like this fucking thing is going to roll hard and heavy."
"13871200","13872800"," And I didn't have any edge."
"13873160","13877620"," So I would like full fucking port and I'd be like counting the money before it was in. "
"13878060","13881600"," And I'd be like all right I'm in for like a hundred and fucking one for a hundred grand right"
"13881600","13881820"," now."
"13881820","13882520"," 120, 130."
"13883000","13886280"," I'm like this fucking thing prints I'm going to be a fucking multimillionaire. "
"13886600","13887840"," It's going to be fucking phenomenal."
"13888200","13890620"," Like I'm going to make millions if we roll here."
"13894500","13895300"," So it's like. "
"13897120","13897920"," So it's like."

"14222690","14223170"," Same as yesterday."
"14224410","14225650"," I was a little pissed off yesterday."
"14227410","14230790"," I felt like if I had been trading alone yesterday, I would have left those calls on right into the"

"14234230","14235990"," This is a very bearish setup though."
"14236110","14237530"," This all looks extremely bearish."
"14237630","14238210"," So watch out here. "
"14239830","14243650"," Under like normal circumstances, that'd be like full bore fucking puts here."

"14280310","14282450"," Bears you don't want to get underneath it though and try to hold it. "
"14283190","14284590"," I'm not exactly sure why."
"14287930","14289010"," They're so bearish here."
"14289210","14290230"," I'm extremely bullish here. "
"14290310","14290870"," I'll be honest with you."
"14291050","14291590"," Up into this close."
"14294190","14297150"," Maybe they'll try to sell this thing down panic for CPI. "
"14297650","14298010"," I don't know."
"14300670","14303190"," Doom and gloom I guess or maybe CPI will be good."
"14303990","14305090"," Maybe I'll say this. "
"14305970","14311550"," If we sell this market down into the close on CPI, I will probably buy zero date calls."
"14312010","14313710"," So if they try to like sell this shit down into CPI."
"14314870","14318370"," It's full bore zero dates for zero date calls for the open tomorrow. "
"14320090","14321890"," So I guess I guess."
"14325170","14326270"," I don't know."
"14326430","14329310"," I guess if you try to sell this down the close tomorrow. "
"14330610","14331970"," Like all doom and gloomy down here."
"14332290","14335010"," I'm definitely buying zero dates on that on that on that bell."
"14335730","14337990"," I'll probably buy 300 of them. "
"14340730","14342690"," Yeah, I don't see that."
"14343070","14345510"," So I guess you can get all the doom and gloom as you want."
"14348210","14350910"," Yeah, if you sell the close up, I'll buy the calls on that one. "
"14352310","14354290"," Give me cheap calls for CPI."

"14380070","14381410"," You're a fucking buyer of CPI."
"14383230","14385330"," How many fucking points is that?"
"14386530","14388490"," Yeah, that's a 40 point move to the upside. "
"14390830","14392130"," You load the fuck up on those."
"14392630","14396170"," You load the fuck up on a on a strangle on that trade too."
"14398090","14399270"," Like load the fuck up. "
"14399390","14401410"," You do like a farther dated strangle on the puts."
"14402770","14404090"," And then you do zero date calls."
"14404650","14406430"," So we'll take a look at that close today as well. "
"14407090","14411930"," So if we trade down into this close, you do like a multi leg strangle."
"14412430","14414310"," You do like a zero date calls."
"14416590","14417010"," Tons of them. "
"14419010","14421670"," And you buy some puts that are much farther dated."
"14422150","14426310"," That are stupidly like 420, 420 P's for like, I don't fucking know."
"14426870","14428330"," Monday or Friday or something. "
"14430090","14432290"," Maybe a week, maybe a week out or something like that."
"14433590","14434970"," This is to make a great strangle."
"14436630","14441090"," Because if we get, if we trade down and we get a great CPI, it's going to fucking explode. "
"14442350","14445290"," The 40 points will pay like three, four, five hundred percent."
"14446070","14447390"," You'll buy your puts for you."
"14448110","14448730"," We'll look at that. "
"14448890","14449850"," I'm going to go to potty really quick."
"14450210","14451970"," We'll look at that trade as we get into the close here."
"14452630","14456850"," It's pretty much what I've got on right now anyways, is that kind of a trade is what I have"
"14456850","14457330"," on the market. "
"14459390","14460550"," Something similar is what I got on."
"14464010","14466390"," So I'll be right back in the 15 minutes or five minutes."
"14466530","14467490"," I'm just going to go P really quick. "
"14468010","14468810"," I'll be right back with you."

"14968850","14970110"," Come here, good boy. "
"14976090","14977190"," Stay with me."
"14981750","14987710"," We have a dog that, um, we got two dogs."
"14989270","14991490"," The one dog that's an emotional basket case. "
"15005780","15007300"," I've got a Henry and Jack."
"15008200","15009720"," So Jack is a border collie."
"15010380","15011380"," Pay a lot of money for him. "
"15011380","15012120"," Got it from a ranch."
"15013720","15014460"," Working ranch."
"15016100","15016580"," AKC. "
"15016760","15018660"," I didn't actually get the AKC certification."
"15018660","15019420"," I just wanted."
"15023540","15026180"," The dog from the family or whatever. "
"15026440","15027580"," So they gave me that paper."
"15027800","15029240"," That dog drove far away to get him."
"15029940","15030620"," The other dog. "
"15032320","15033200"," Border collie."
"15033420","15034120"," No, not a bird collie."
"15034420","15035000"," Aussie Shepherd. "
"15035820","15036960"," He's one of the best case."
"15037140","15037700"," They're going to kill him."
"15038260","15039140"," His name is Henry. "
"15039340","15040020"," So Henry and Jack."
"15043910","15045070"," And great dogs."
"15045750","15045910"," So. "
"15049970","15052530"," But the one dog they were going to kill him."
"15054850","15057110"," He was left alone with his owner."
"15057510","15058450"," His owner passed away. "
"15059610","15060670"," And he ate his owner."
"15061650","15062550"," To survive."
"15062970","15066510"," So he's had emotional instability issues his entire life. "
"15067990","15068590"," So."
"15070530","15072530"," He's like a high need dog."
"15073330","15075790"," My other dog, the one that I raised from a puppy. "
"15076290","15078190"," It's like well adjusted, well trained."
"15078970","15080690"," Perfect dog in every way."
"15082390","15083830"," But you can tell this other one. "
"15083930","15086190"," You can tell this one's, you know, kind of fucked up."
"15086550","15088330"," Some fucked up shit happened to him."
"15091150","15091710"," And he's. "
"15092270","15093950"," So he's like needs to be coddled."
"15094090","15094530"," Needs to be held."
"15095310","15096230"," Needs to know you love him. "
"15096770","15097510"," All that kind of stuff."
"15099310","15102130"," And he's always needs to know that you love him."
"15102290","15102850"," And it comes in. "
"15103050","15103990"," He's a great dog too."
"15104210","15104830"," Because my other dog."
"15105690","15107070"," You leave that dog in the. "
"15107510","15109590"," That dog will sit on my porch and never leave."
"15109590","15112750"," Just like guard the house, patrol the kids, round them all up."
"15113430","15114170"," This dog here. "
"15114850","15117170"," He like comes in and he's like, I need a hug man."
"15117470","15118350"," And I'm like, come on over here."
"15118390","15118810"," I give you a hug. "
"15120110","15123170"," So I was just saying to him, like, I was like, come on, come with Daddy."
"15123490","15126690"," And so my wife's office is down the hall."
"15128370","15131550"," And he dipped to go see her and I was like, are you cheating on me?"
"15132470","15133910"," I'm like, I just called you to come hang out with Daddy. "
"15134010","15135030"," You're going to go over there and see her."
"15135930","15136990"," I'm like, you should be cheating on me."
"15137590","15138610"," I'm like, I love you more. "
"15141050","15141750"," No, God."
"15141830","15142990"," They're going to try to sell it right here."
"15143650","15144810"," He's fucking sellers. "
"15144810","15145370"," Look at him."
"15146070","15147490"," It's like a perfect place, right?"
"15148110","15149030"," Bloodbath it down."
"15154120","15155660"," So much drama here. "
"15158240","15158960"," Right there."
"15159140","15161300"," That's the, uh, wait a minute."
"15161640","15162700"," Hey, press Enter. "
"15163040","15163360"," Hold on here."
"15165440","15167420"," Here's where your bloodbath is right here."
"15169700","15171120"," It's really going to try to do it right now. "
"15184210","15187710"," So this dog, I'm like, we have this, like, funny ass relation."
"15187970","15189690"," Our relationship is quite funny."
"15193050","15194850"," Because, you know, they don't speak human. "
"15195010","15196450"," My wife and kids think they speak human."
"15197510","15198870"," So I'm always threatening him."
"15202690","15205730"," And, uh, I'm like, not aggressively or anything. "
"15207030","15210050"," But at the same time, I treat him like gold, you know."
"15211510","15214990"," And, uh, my kids are always like, Dad, no, Dad."
"15216850","15223750"," But it's more like a jest or something or, um, comedy, like inter-family comedy. "
"15234730","15236930"," Yeah, they're, they're going to try to pull this down right now."
"15239950","15240870"," I don't know."
"15240990","15243090"," I mean, uh, HYG is high. "
"15243450","15244750"," Uh, Dixie's rolling over."
"15246410","15247970"," Now, this is revenge, right?"
"15248390","15249810"," This is all pure revenge, right?"
"15249970","15252830"," All this is like somebody just jumping in and slamming the cell button."
"15258220","15262080"," Uh, I don't, I don't know if it looks weak right here, but Nasdaq looks fine too, right here. "
"15262180","15263900"," So I'm still watching it."
"15264260","15266420"," Maybe there's a quick push down than the repire."
"15266420","15267560"," Maybe it's something like that. "
"15268620","15269500"," And it's possible."
"15270300","15271440"," You get a big push up."
"15271560","15273660"," You get one, two, and then three. "
"15273960","15275280"," There's just more emotional trading."
"15280550","15287530"," That's why I say don't drink the Kool-Aid two is due to, um, I think this is positioning by"
"15287530","15288770"," banks, to be honest with you."
"15290170","15293450"," The size that needs to come in the market, they want to get a certain price. "
"15294670","15298110"," Um, you can see just over the past couple of weeks here."
"15299350","15301290"," Actually extends back into the 15th."
"15302650","15304550"," Where you just don't, you're not getting. "
"15305670","15307790"," These banks aren't getting the prices that they want."
"15308030","15309070"," They're getting loans from banks."
"15310750","15312990"," There's fucking QE in the market right now. "
"15313670","15314750"," Whether you know it or not."
"15314950","15315250"," It's here."
"15319940","15320620"," So we'll see. "
"15321480","15324120"," Um, I'm still in some, uh, Saturday calls for today."
"15324900","15326940"," I'm going to hold these things likely into the close."
"15328080","15333860"," I do have some monthly puts, uh, but they don't expire until August. "
"15334600","15337920"," And, uh, therefore that scenario where something goes wrong."
"15338660","15339380"," Not just that."
"15339480","15343660"," Like the consolidation part of the market, the consolidation part of the quarter. "
"15344240","15346200"," Um, the positioning of the quarter."
"15347540","15350500"," Sometimes you get a nice, a nice, uh, low price to buy."
"15351560","15354120"," I'm looking to buy the markets in size. "
"15355160","15360300"," Uh, around that time period, too, right around that 15th, 19th, 21st."
"15360980","15364180"," I'm looking to put a nice, uh, long trade on for the quarter."
"15366060","15373800"," Uh, now if we begin to trade higher, we have to place that trade, uh, higher. "
"15374260","15378380"," So that, that long trade, if we break above at any point and hold it."
"15378380","15379980"," I'm just going to show this to you."
"15380860","15388910"," Um, we have at any point, right?"
"15395100","15396300"," We actually do this. "
"15398040","15399920"," Where we just start like coming up here."
"15401000","15403100"," And holding this for another move higher."
"15404400","15406920"," Uh, I'm going to have to put my put size in the market there. "
"15407400","15409100"," I mean, nothing I can do."
"15409440","15409820"," So."
"15411120","15414140"," Oh, I will take that trade with a, with a bunch of money to the upside. "
"15414320","15416360"," So this is where sellers don't want that, right?"
"15416360","15418220"," So I just want that nice dip."
"15418720","15419120"," 435."
"15419620","15421140"," They'd really like to get down to that 420. "
"15421900","15423240"," So I can buy this market up."
"15423380","15426680"," You're going to hear it's like sellers tell you that it's a bubble top and all that kind of shit."
"15427040","15427280"," It's not. "
"15428660","15430280"," It hasn't shown itself to be."
"15430560","15432360"," It'd be like the shortest bull run in history."
"15434300","15436640"," There's a, the chances are not on your side. "
"15436920","15439320"," The chances are on your side to have a capitulation moment."
"15440300","15443760"," Chances are not on your side for that to be a double top in the bull run to be over."
"15444480","15446000"," It's actually against you. "
"15447200","15448680"," In a major way."
"15451280","15454140"," Let me see if we can find some stuff to talk about here."
"15455860","15459640"," U.S. Senate files a $886 billion defense bill. "
"15460320","15461140"," That's good for GDP."
"15462320","15464900"," You guys have heard me talk about that in the past, right?"
"15466580","15469160"," That we're getting very smart with war."
"15471600","15481200"," As the decades pass, just the threat of war or proxy wars that involve these other countries"
"15481200","15482580"," but not their fighters. "
"15483400","15485820"," We're getting better at it's gross, but that's what's happening."
"15486940","15489080"," So the threat of war with China is good for GDP."
"15489960","15491160"," It softens recessions. "
"15493180","15495840"," You've got a war going on with Ukraine and Russia."
"15495840","15499220"," You've got most of the fighters from Russia being minorities."
"15499380","15501760"," It's not nice, but it is what it is. "
"15503160","15507560"," I don't want to see war in Ukraine at all, but that's what's happening."
"15508200","15511700"," Ukraine is paying a price to join NATO and the UN."
"15513360","15516460"," And they're paying for that with blood, right?"
"15516980","15518740"," Brutal, but that's what's happening. "
"15519480","15524380"," We're funding that and we're also building up in Europe and we're building up in Europe and we're"
"15524380","15525220"," building up in Europe."
"15526100","15529280"," And we're getting rid of old weaponry to replace it."
"15529420","15534100"," So we've got even forget the spending bullshit, replacing all that stuff. "
"15537040","15538760"," So that's what we talked about, right?"
"15538980","15542700"," The US Secretary of State Blinken says Z and Biden are to talk in months ahead."
"15543320","15544340"," Dude, I got to tell you guys some."
"15544660","15547260"," It would not fucking shock me like nothing. "
"15547640","15549840"," I'm not a conspiracy theorist at all, dude."
"15549840","15556300"," It would not fucking shock me to see that all these people are in on it together."
"15557280","15561000"," Like China, Putin, and the US. "
"15563420","15568340"," If I was a diplomat, honestly, this is gross to say."
"15570380","15579000"," It's magically when we leave recessionary times, we magically resolve issues with other countries."
"15579840","15584180"," We magically resolve war, the threat of war. "
"15584600","15588740"," We magically usually go to better relationships with other nations."
"15590120","15593660"," So in a period of growth, all these countries get along."
"15595080","15601360"," When you have risk of global financial meltdowns, these leaders, I shit you not. "
"15601620","15606180"," I'm not the leaders, but the diplomats, they do get together and talk."
"15606180","15614460"," And it would never shock me to tear them, know that, to soften the blow of recession."
"15615880","15619800"," And all of these nations, they have proxy wars and threats of fighting. "
"15620260","15621900"," Now, can they get out of control and have a reward?"
"15622120","15622580"," Yes."
"15623200","15627520"," But a lot of this in the background is the function of economies."
"15628520","15631580"," Some of our world wars have started due to that too. "
"15632140","15638800"," Most nations that begin world wars and shit, if you find out later on that, they come out and say,"
"15639100","15641940"," well, I knew that we weren't going to have enough oil."
"15642220","15643040"," We weren't going to have enough gas."
"15643280","15644300"," We weren't going to have enough rubber. "
"15644560","15646300"," We weren't going to have enough this for that."
"15646860","15647800"," We didn't tell anybody."
"15648900","15650780"," And so we went surprise motherfucker. "
"15651140","15651740"," We're at war now."
"15652060","15654220"," We're going to take as fast as we can."
"15654560","15656120"," I think they're getting better at war. "
"15656460","15657440"," I know it's gross to say."
"15659000","15660700"," Now, you still have to be serious."
"15660700","15664620"," As a country and take it serious, that could be that you never trust. "
"15664800","15665960"," You don't turn your back on these countries."
"15666580","15673740"," I think that maybe they're not doing that as irresponsible of you as a trader, right, to know that"
"15673740","15675780"," they're going to try to soften these recessionary periods."
"15676500","15677040"," That kind of stuff. "
"15677640","15678840"," You can see the blood right now."
"15678920","15679820"," They're trying to sell this down."
"15680380","15682700"," It's a perfect bear setup to sell this. "
"15682700","15687480"," So if you're along the zeridates, you better be able to burn them to the ground if you need to,"
"15687480","15689860"," or buy yourself some puts to protect for a few minutes."
"15689860","15691920"," 15, 20 minutes, pretty bearish air."
"15692520","15693900"," Now, 141 in the afternoon. "
"15694600","15695900"," So that just came out earlier."
"15696660","15698000"," What else do you have for news here?"
"15701760","15705820"," UK employment data drives up the chance of 50 BPS hike by Bank of England."
"15706480","15708920"," That means UK is strong. "
"15709620","15710580"," That's what it means, right?"
"15711400","15717900"," On Tuesday, China's new economic assistance measures helped commodities and equities rise, but"
"15717900","15722060"," policymakers' cautions about higher interest rates lasting longer damp in the mood."
"15722200","15722740"," That's bullshit."
"15723820","15726120"," No company cares about interest rates. "
"15726580","15731100"," Zero companies do not care about interest rates."
"15732320","15736420"," They take loans through all up and down markets."
"15737660","15741680"," They just need the money available from central banks to be given to them. "
"15741820","15745560"," They don't care about the rate, just that the money is there and available."
"15746040","15748200"," You guys, hopefully you guys understand that concept."
"15748920","15752840"," The numerous Fed officials reiterated the need to tighten further this year. "
"15753400","15756660"," Futures on the SMB 500 Nasdaq went on to struggle to build on Monday's small gains."
"15757240","15761140"," Raising worries for the world's largest economy may enter a recession."
"15761420","15762260"," That's all bullshit too. "
"15764040","15767940"," Treasury yields decreased and the dollar index fell for a third day in a row."
"15771020","15774860"," While central bank officials in Europe and the US are warning that the fight against inflation has"
"15774860","15775600"," turned a corner."
"15776180","15779720"," The equally cautioned that higher rates will need to be in place for a longer period of time in"
"15779720","15781120"," order to maintain price stability. "
"15781780","15782560"," I'm going to agree with that."
"15783480","15788220"," They either pause the maintaining of rates."
"15790860","15798400"," We are coming into a time period of a question of threat for right now. "
"15799200","15802200"," We want to be year over year at four right now."
"15803860","15806220"," We will start to question at some point."
"15807240","15809260"," Will the Fed be a hammer again?"
"15810540","15814180"," So far, they're not acting like a hammer. "
"15814600","15815200"," Hold on a second here."
"15825970","15826730"," Sorry about that."
"15826790","15830630"," I got a hole in some rafts and we found the hole. "
"15837540","15839780"," There should be some questioning at some point."
"15842120","15844320"," The Fed's trying not to be the hammer anymore."
"15844480","15847600"," They usually do overdo things, right?"
"15848160","15853060"," The Fed's trying to say that they're not that fed anymore. "
"15855020","15856860"," I don't know if that's true or not."
"15857380","15864700"," It's yet to be proven, but they are performing QE quietly, but not like they used to."
"15864700","15867960"," And they're subdued in a lot of their stuff now. "
"15868100","15876720"," Even if we get rate hikes, another 25 or a second 25 or just the threats of rate hikes."
"15877440","15882080"," And I like the idea of maintaining minimum of maintaining at this point."
"15884700","15887820"," Rates where they are and possibly even higher. "
"15888540","15891460"," I'd like to get above or below the rate of inflation."
"15893400","15896300"," I think that's I think that smells the same for Europe as well."
"15898080","15902800"," It's like it's like it's trying to give time for this COVID bullshit cycle to play out. "
"15903200","15904720"," Get everybody in the same page."
"15905080","15906420"," Dump this shit to the depths of hell."
"15906940","15908300"," And then we start a new cycle. "
"15909040","15910740"," We like wipe our hands of COVID."
"15913440","15915400"," You see here, what else is in here?"
"15917280","15921320"," Well, some of your beneficials in Europe in the years of warning that the fight against inflation"
"15921320","15922120"," has turned to corner."
"15922300","15922840"," I agree with that. "
"15923060","15926640"," The ugly caution that higher rates will need to be in place for a longer period of time."
"15926820","15927640"," I agree with that too."
"15928360","15929880"," To maintain price ability. "
"15930140","15930700"," I agree with all that."
"15930840","15931900"," You need everybody in the same page."
"15932960","15937140"," For stock bulls who had to endure dismal start to the second half of the year after outstanding"
"15937140","15938080"," gains in the first half. "
"15938820","15939560"," That's a mixed blessing."
"15940080","15941080"," I don't know about that."
"15941980","15943480"," This is bizarre comment. "
"15943920","15944580"," That's really bizarre."
"15945820","15947440"," I don't get that."
"15950940","15952380"," I'm missing this. "
"15952780","15953420"," Wait a minute."
"15953500","15954220"," This one just went away."
"15954500","15955240"," Can't read it anymore. "
"15955360","15955640"," I don't know why."
"15957520","15958560"," It just disappeared."
"15959140","15960420"," Looks like they're rewriting it or something. "
"15962260","15965280"," They just deleted it from their page."
"15966560","15968420"," But it's just kind of bizarre."
"15969800","15972920"," Like bulls expecting something special to the start of the year. "
"15973220","15975820"," This whole year has been outstanding even to today."
"15977480","15979340"," Everything right in here is kind of wonky to me."
"15985950","15989730"," Yeah, I'm watching an IBM here. "
"15990130","15990530"," It looks great."
"15993130","15993970"," It looks great."
"15994770","15996070"," Spoons looking a little bit weak right now. "
"15999190","16000050"," I'm watching it in the background."
"16000830","16002890"," I'm also going to bring up here and do some talking while this happens."
"16003870","16007010"," Be careful of this weakness in spy right now. "
"16016050","16017590"," And it's trading it right now."
"16018870","16023660"," I'm grinding it right now."
"16025280","16027020"," They're trying to kill my calls here, man. "
"16027140","16027900"," What are they fucking doing?"
"16028820","16029840"," They don't want to pay these things."
"16032840","16034240"," I'm also going to look at here."
"16035160","16040230"," I'm trying to not pay me. "
"16041010","16044370"," These guys not know them and hold these fucking things right into the bell."
"16045770","16048550"," They probably do know that I'm going to hold them right in the bell."
"16049630","16050510"," That would be my guess. "
"16052990","16054090"," Let's see if I have anything else."
"16067310","16068070"," Come on, baby."
"16076190","16078150"," Dude, I got to add fucking more to this position. "
"16078530","16079470"," This is pissing me off."
"16093430","16094850"," Alright, adding some more."
"16101830","16104210"," Holy shit, they really fucked up Tweet Deck, huh?"

"23811910","23812650"," I don't know."
"23814890","23816630"," It's a pretty expensive right now. "
"23816630","23819030"," 73 cents right now for those four forty fives."

"23826930","23829470"," Just break above this four four three one three. "
"23829550","23830370"," It's all it needs to be."
"23831430","23833110"," I'd be really wary of this."
"23833290","23836230"," You need a bit explosive move to the upside and needs to hold. "
"23839090","23843950"," Maybe I don't know if you maybe you start a small position for tomorrow at four forty five not"
"23843950","23844930"," financial advice."
"23845310","23849850"," But dude, like if that shit comes down, like this ship rolls in the last 15 minutes here, then"

"23852130","23853710"," You would say start small. "
"23854230","23854990"," Small position."
"23857950","23858770"," Small position."
"23859710","23866450"," And then DCA at 4.15. And dude for that price puts Missy puts here. "
"23866910","23868110"," You put your expense for tomorrow."
"23868630","23869530"," The fuck are they thinking?"
"23870330","23871230"," You know what I would say to you?"
"23871330","23872610"," I would caution you of something."
"23873410","23875870"," Four thirty fourth peas or ten cents. "
"23877090","23878130"," I throw on some insurance."
"23878690","23880010"," They're now trading 78 cents."
"23880190","23880870"," You sick fucks. "
"23881490","23883790"," So think about this."
"23884890","23887610"," You're buying a call for 76 cents, right?"
"23888550","23890290"," What's another 10 cents?"
"23890830","23893830"," Just to protect your ass in case CPI is bad."
"23894970","23898150"," For me, I'm not going to buy any calls for tomorrow. "
"23898150","23899630"," I think they're too expensive."
"23900610","23903290"," 77 cents for a 30 delta call for tomorrow."
"23903290","23905030"," Right now to me is pricey. "
"23906510","23910430"," Without putting a zero date hedge on four thirty fours."
"23910990","23911770"," Sound right?"
"23912090","23914910"," If we got a bloodbath tomorrow, we probably trade four thirty five."
"23915470","23918850"," I don't see that happening, but it's the cost of doing business. "
"23919610","23922350"," I don't want to spend 80 cents on fucking zero dates with tomorrow."
"23922350","23922950"," I'll be honest with you."
"23922990","23923490"," I'm a cheap fuck. "
"23926750","23928810"," I fucking love all of you out there."

"23939370","23940590"," Eight thirty in the morning."
"23940810","23941130"," CPI."
"23941630","23942570"," Eight thirty in the morning. "
"23945630","23949030"," Four forty five is now trading 81 cents."
"23949250","23950130"," They don't even care right now."
"23950210","23951170"," It's like fucking I'm buying them. "
"23952970","23953370"," Damn."
"23955530","23956770"," Just don't care."
"23956950","23959690"," Just buy the dip, buy the tops, buy it at the top every time. "
"23960130","23964930"," I'm down there at the bottom trying to buy four cent calls, buying three cent calls, eleven cent"
"23964930","23966030"," calls, fucking twenty."
"23966430","23968970"," I'm like, give me more bags, give me more bags, give me more bags."
"23969350","23972270"," You guys are like, some of you guys out there like, what are you doing?"
"23972270","23973370"," I'm like, I'm buying it all. "
"23975890","23977790"," Now we're up here for 76 cents."
"23977850","23978790"," You guys want to buy calls?"
"23979030","23979630"," Fuck that noise."
"23980270","23982490"," Buy them down at like thirty cents or forty cents. "
"23987010","23988050"," Three fifty nine."
"23990110","23993090"," One more down here a little bit cheaper at four fifteen."
"23993550","23996050"," Try to get them as cheap as possible if you want them for tomorrow. "
"23996770","23998190"," The move is to the upside."
"23998630","23999430"," How high that is."
"23999650","24000050"," I don't know. "
"24000170","24002370"," Looks like it's kind of sell the news to some extent."
"24003130","24007210"," Bulls want to be over four forty four point two zero I"
"24007210","24015870"," love all of you out there every last one."
"24015970","24017790"," I love every single one of you. "
"24018230","24020630"," Bears, bulls, buyers, sellers."
"24020970","24021270"," I don't care."
"24021350","24022870"," I love all you guys showing up with me every day. "
"24023510","24024550"," Love all you guys."
"24025070","24026170"," What a day man."
"24026430","24028030"," Unreal move up in the spy. "
"24028870","24030110"," Day three."
"24031270","24032670"," Three for three."
"24034070","24037310"," Told you about the one return to seeing the crime last week on Twitter. "
"24037930","24038890"," Did it again yesterday."
"24038890","24040070"," Do it again today."

"24073010","24074110"," I don't recommend it."
"24074450","24076610"," They got a high price on calls. "
"24076910","24078510"," It's zero dates from about seventy cents."
"24078690","24080290"," They don't get fucked like no fucking way."
"24080590","24082090"," They were seventy nine at one point. "
"24082570","24083870"," They're seventy two cents right now."
"24083870","24084530"," Seventy one cents."
