"2135610","2145460"," decision Now Saying all that right saying all that There is a"
"2145460","2155360"," point here that if you get your 25 BPS today Is that it and the second question is If they"

"5853210","5862960"," with trying to trade this all I'm gonna say this as usual The best trade on today is no trade"
"5863740","5871380"," Seriously best trade today is no trade There are so many days of the week so many sessions where We"
"5871380","5877400"," don't have these unexpected events and market just kind of follows Normal patterns right normal"
"5877400","5887120"," trading up down pretty easy to see Your best trade is no trade today That's my only financial"
"5887120","5891140"," advice do not trade this if you called your financial advisor, they would say are you already a"
"5891140","5894180"," fucking mind So i'm gonna tell you the same thing. "
"5894280","5900860"," Okay, just stay away from this you don't want none of this dewy Uh Second thing I would say this"
"5900860","5907560"," is now this is the not financial advice part if you do choose to trade this Uh, don't be trading"
"5907560","5909220"," your whole accounts on days like today."
"5909240","5915260"," Don't be doing that shit You want to take a lot of trade or something for fun Like you're playing"
"5915260","5921980"," squares or something at a football game You're at I don't know a bingo hall or something You're not"
"5921980","5926400"," letting your rent ride as you make your grandmother Uh, the money to pay off our mortgage or"
"5926400","5928320"," something That's fine."
"5928640","5934280"," You know like that's just uh, we're having fun kind of a deal If you are going to trade this"
"5934280","5940340"," this the other things I want to say to you is this oftentimes on days like today Uh, let's see"
"5940340","5944260"," you get positioned In the wrong way, right?"
"5944460","5950960"," Let's say you're taking puts or calls And uh, you've got stops on on a day like today They might"
"5950960","5958480"," not help And it might be better just hold whatever you're holding until it prints So if you're a"
"5958480","5963080"," bear out there and you're like I got puts There might be an opportunity if let's say you buy them"
"5963080","5969340"," for 50 cents and they go down to 20 Uh, I'd probably leave them on there's probably a chance at"
"5969340","5975040"," some point today that you're going to get a print out of those puts or an escape Same thing with"
"5975040","5983320"," the call side Now saying that Uh, make sure that you're taking the money and running As the market"
"5983320","5990260"," is reprised So you have heavy positioning in the market for this event And you're going to get"
"5990260","5998560"," volatility crush right ball crush or interest Uh interest leaving this event right as this interest"
"5998560","6005400"," leaves if you've got 10 people That are interested in protecting the other underlying holdings in"
"6005400","6011560"," the market So I've got a bunch of zero and eight puts protecting my Uh, my underlying in this"
"6011560","6016440"," market on this market today And the market does nothing major happens, right?"
"6017160","6022600"," And now there's only nine of you there Or excuse me, uh two of you there instead of 10 people"
"6022600","6022880"," there. "
"6023040","6029280"," You're just a put trader Rather than protecting your underlying and now there's only two of you"
"6029280","6030960"," trading it what happens, right?"
"6031280","6037660"," They reprice For only those two participants and not the original 10 that were there So you're"
"6037660","6045300"," going to be careful of volatility crush and the re pricing of options Uh as the event unfolds so as"
"6045900","6053100"," Uh, the press release is released and then of course, uh, Jerome Powell Speaks in the presser,"
"6053200","6053320"," right?"
"6053500","6054620"," You'll see volatility crush."
"6054840","6064120"," So Let's say you were making trades yesterday Uh That it that that volatility the implied ball that"
"6064120","6071660"," option interest Was higher yesterday than it is today As that as that those options get reprised it"
"6071660","6078600"," usually Reprisings will take place Twice to three times today and then there'll be more repricing"
"6078600","6085340"," into tomorrow For whichever direction the stock market takes So just be aware of that you could be"
"6085340","6090800"," up on your trade The price could be going in a direction and your options would be uh worth less"
"6090800","6095800"," than you paid for them So let's take a quick look at that for right now and see what i'm"
"6095800","6103220"," when i'm trying to say to you in even simpler terms So let me give you a better explanation here"
"6105160","6106940"," We'll take a look at this right now."
"6106940","6109600"," So let's say you're in puts, right?"
"6111040","6118700"," And we start to go down here So we start to bleed down here You get this bleed down here,"
"6118700","6124620"," right And your puts are worth now a dollar there were 50 cents now they're worth a dollar, right?"
"6125380","6126900"," Uh into this event, right?"
"6127400","6128960"," And we start to squeeze higher here. "
"6129120","6130440"," Let's say we get a reject rejection."
"6130600","6132660"," Jerome comes out and says fuck your calls, right?"
"6133380","6139020"," We start to head down again a second time Right and these are back here."
"6139180","6145340"," These are worth a dollar These likely won't be worth a dollar again down here, right?"
"6145460","6147780"," A dollar 10 even a dollar 20. "
"6147980","6154920"," Nope These will likely be worth now Let's say 50 cents does that make sense even more amplified and"
"6154920","6160000"," up here there are worth like one penny at 1.2 pennies Uh just as an example."
"6160240","6166560"," This isn't what's going to happen Uh and then the same thing could even continue down here Uh so"
"6166560","6173180"," you get like one reprising two repricings and then a third reprising after the event So my point to"
"6173180","6179380"," you would be That you wouldn't hold your puts If you nail that and then come back down, right?"
"6179800","6186160"," You're not going to hold your puts through the entire move You're actually going to take the money"
"6186160","6191360"," and run And then reposition For another down move, right?"
"6192000","6196180"," So take the money and run take the money and run again down here and even if we get further"
"6196180","6203300"," down side of the close You're going to take the money and run and then reposition again Same thing"
"6203300","6204860"," applies to the upside."
"6204980","6211100"," So if you're a bull out there Let's say we're weak down into this 11.30 1.30. Let's say"

"6263640","6267660"," below major pivots So failure. "
"6267860","6275240"," So let's say our upside target out here at r2 Is 445 33 you get a failure at like four"

"14588420","14593400"," Nope as you put it This meeting is about november and december and what he messaged i agree with"
"14593400","14598920"," that if we break it down this way Very very simply 2023 is about the fed cycle coming to an"
"14598920","14605200"," end and then getting the job done to do enough To get inflation down towards target and keep it"
"14605200","14612220"," anchored there 2024 is about holding rates higher for longer or potentially even cutting if"
"14612220","14618740"," economic conditions Seeing that it's likely that they need to do so So The market will have no"
"14618740","14625140"," patience for rate hikes further rate hikes in 2024 because if that's happening then that means that"
"14625140","14629780"," that is miss Something inflation is accelerating and that they're going to have to do something"
"14629780","14635740"," more drastic to bring inflation down So I think if we look at this more broadly we need to see"
"14635740","14641200"," in 2023 The fed get the job done So look as far as the way that I see this uh"
"14641200","14647560"," see this meeting this meeting is all about positioning their potential policy act for november or"
"14647560","14653580"," even december I look at this and the overlay to me is the good work of your ellen zettner award "
"14653580","14659420","-winning economics And she's marked down gdp of revisions and some actual present numbers and she's"
"14659420","14665520"," come down a fair amount Half a percentage point of real gdp or even more are we on the edge"
"14665520","14666700"," of a stagflation here?"
"14666900","14673880"," Or are we pulling from an atlanta gdp guess of 6% where all of a sudden gdp slows down"
"14673880","14681060"," and changes the fed decision So so I I think that you know third quarter gdp is likely to be"
"14681060","14686020"," still you know relatively strong and robust In the fourth quarter there's likely to be some give"
"14686020","14690560"," back But I think that I think ellen's on to something here though I think the markets are going to"
"14690560","14694440"," start to read through this and they're going to say like look third quarter gdp Some good"
"14694440","14699380"," technicals things are you know things are strong, but this might be the last big the rash in the"
"14699380","14704520"," economy Before it really starts to slow down now if we think about this from the fed's perspective"
"14704520","14710060"," This is what rate hikes are supposed to do you're supposed to see a slowdown in in gdp growth a"
"14710060","14716060"," slowdown in inflation Slow down and in wage growth and and and everything and even housing and and"
"14716060","14723580"," everything else so The the the goal here for the fed is to get inflation down and keep it anchored"
"14723580","14730360"," and keep it down Dorably Just getting a slowdown or potentially even a mild recession Yeah, that"
"14730360","14735540"," could help in terms of bringing inflation down But the point is is that they have to keep it"
"14735540","14741980"," anchored because what could start to happen if they don't is by the middle of 2024 The year over"
"14741980","14747520"," year base effects might make inflation start to re-accelerate higher So it's imperative for the fed"
"14747520","14755940"," to get inflation under control between now and the middle of 2024 Jim brace castman jeffy mulga You"

"18589060","18594580"," people write down what they think and you've got you have some you saw i think seven wrote down no"
"18594580","18598940"," hike at this at this meeting or between now and the end of the year and i think 12 wrote"
"18598940","18605000"," down uh another single hike in one of the next two meetings that we have between the end of the"
"18605000","18609540"," year so it wasn't like we were arguing over that people just stating their positions and really"
"18609540","18613800"," what what people are saying is let's see how the data come in you know we want to see you"
"18613800","18618120"," know we want to see we want to see that that this this uh it's trying to buy time right"
"18618120","18621480"," now that we've been seeing for the last three months we want to see that it's more than just three"
"18621480","18627200"," months right we want to see you know the the the labor market report that we received the last one"
"18627200","18631780"," that received was a good example of we do what we do want to see it was a combination of"
"18631780","18637680"," of uh you know of across a broad range of indicators continuing a rebalancing of the labor market"
"18637680","18642300"," so those are the two things that those are all get murdered right now and that's that's the"
"18642300","18647940"," progress that we want to see but i think people all due going to the depths of hell not to"
"18647940","18653800"," jump to a conclusion really one way or the other but just be convinced that the data at you know"
"18653800","18660940"," target tagged down below it's 1373 given how far we've gone back at the target above it at 1379 to"
"18660940","18667340"," be able to look forward to the downside coming data and the evolving outlooks in 1359 we already"
"18667340","18672320"," tagged that one earlier in your view what would at 2 p.m the ball slam down there what would"
"18672320","18678320"," one more hike at the end of the next whoa would be 1340 on this side what would no hike"
"18678320","18682680"," do if you could sort of game that out for us so you know you you can make the argument"
"18682680","18687260"," that one hike one way or the other won't matter if you're watching vix right now 1402 is the"
"18687260","18692880"," rejection point for vix it's a pretty tight cluster of uh of where we think that that policy stance"
"18692880","18697140"," might be but we're always going to be learning from data you know we've we've learned all through"
"18697140","18702660"," the course of the last year that actually is the extremely bullish on this news today's ranking to"
"18702660","18707080"," the upside wrote down it's actually gotten higher and higher so we don't really know that's the"
"18707080","18712780"," exit of 27 ema coming up on the 129 ema looking for a push higher a year ago we proceeded"
"18712780","18720440"," pretty quickly to get rates up now now we're fairly close we think to where we need to get it's"
"18720440","18726100"," just a quick question of reaching the right stance i wouldn't attribute huge importance to one hike"
"18726100","18733540"," in macroeconomic terms nonetheless you know we need we need to get to a place where we're confident"
"18733540","18739880"," that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to two percent over time that's what we need"
"18739880","18744560"," to get to and we've been you know we've been moving toward it as we've gotten closer to it we've"
"18744560","18749380"," slowed the pace at which we've moved i think that was appropriate and now that we're getting closer"
"18749380","18757740"," we again we have the ability to proceed carefully oh we got a ton of shit to go over now"
"18757740","18764660"," he broke out the charts today he's like i'm like what is he gonna say to make the market wait"
"18764660","18770960"," for the the role he's he's trying to tell you that you're gonna be waiting a year he's trying to"
"18770960","18776800"," try to get that message out if people i don't know if it's real or not but need another real"
"18776800","18780940"," point of the funds rate on it does it tell you that there's tell us at the committee believes that"
"18780940","18787340"," thanks for the persistent requires more medicine effectively and i guess a related question is if"
"18787340","18795760"," you're gonna project a funds rate above the longer run rate for four years in a row at what point"
"18795760","18801620"," do we start to think hey maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually higher thank you so"
"18801620","18808720"," i guess i would point more to rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more"
"18808720","18814500"," persistent i wouldn't think that's not we've seen inflation be more persistent over the course of"
"18814500","18818540"," the past year but i wouldn't say that's something that's appeared in the recent data it's more"
"18818540","18825700"," about stronger economic activity i would say so if i had to attribute one thing again we're we're"
"18825700","18830600"," picking a mediums here and trying to attribute one explanation but i think broadly stronger"
"18830600","18836420"," economic activity means means rates we have to do more with rates and that's what that that's what"
"18836420","18842040"," that meeting is is telling you um in terms of of what the neutral rate can be you know we"
"18842040","18847660"," we uh we know it by its works we only know it by its works really we can't we can't"
"18847660","18853180"," you know the the the models and and that we the economy reacts and again that's another reason why"
"18853180","18859560"," we're where we're moving carefully now because you know there are lags here so that it may it may"
"18859560","18864800"," of course be that that the that the neutral rate has risen you do see people you don't see the"
"18864800","18870320"," median moving but you do see people raising their estimates of of the neutral rate and if you are"
"18870320","18875240"," on well that the neutral rate is higher than if you are on youtube a longer run rate remember what"
"18875240","18881020"," we write down in the history of the longer way right down there if you're on youtube that uh you"
"18881020","18886600"," know that the that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that and that uh that's part of"
"18886600","18898010"," the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than than expected uh Howard"
"18898010","18903250"," Shiley with Reuters thank you um so you said several times that the economy needed a period of"
"18903250","18909130"," below trend growth uh to get inflation consistently back to 2 percent you kind of get that in 2024"
"18909130","18915330"," a little bit 1.5 percent is just a touch below uh what's the estimate of potential so uh the"
"18915330","18920310"," fact that you're getting so much done at so much less cost does that represent a change in how you"
"18920310","18925450"," think inflation works a change in how you think the economy works a change in the mix of supply"
"18925450","18932190"," healing versus demand destruction that's necessary to achieve this yes of course it is a it is a"
"18932190","18938590"," good thing that we we've seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in"
"18938590","18948510"," unemployment and that's that's because we're working gap you're also seeing"
"18948510","18956030"," supply side things so so that's happening um I would say though we still I still think and I think"
"18956030","18960830"," broadly people still think that will have to be some softening in the labor market that can come"
"18960830","18966290"," through some more supply as we've seen as well also remember the natural rate we think is is coming"
"18966290","18972810"," down which is a supply side thing so that the gap between any given unemployment rate that's lower"
"18972810","18977510"," than that and the natural rate comes down that's a way for supply so that's a way for the labor"
"18977510","18983270"," market to achieve a better balance so all of those things are happening you're right in in the in"
"18983270","18989470"," the median forecast we don't see a big increase in unemployment we do see an increase and um but"
"18989470","18993910"," that's that really is just playing forward the travel giving up at the 20-seventy a man a five "
"18993910","18998190","-minute chart bearish their may come a Disney starting rolling a 20-seventy a man a one-minute chart"
"18998190","19001950"," what the bear is what we've been seeing now is that rejecting it's one minute 20-seventy a man"
"19001950","19008410"," going back down to retest it's a career prior low HYG becoming bearish air they do have a gap they"
"19008410","19018350"," they still have not filled to the downside at 74-40 soft landing now a baseline expectation no no I"
"19018350","19025450"," would not do that I would just say what would I say about that um I've always thought that the"
"19025450","19032370"," soft landing was was a plausible outcome that there was a path really to to a soft landing I"
"19032370","19038050"," thought that and I've said that since we lifted off it's also possible that the path is narrowed"
"19038050","19045270"," and it's widened apparently ultimately it made this maybe decided by factors that are outside our"
"19045270","19050490"," control at the end of the day but I do think it's I do think it's possible and you know"
"19050490","19060270"," I also think you"
"19060270","19066510"," know this is why we're a physician to move carefully again that we will restore price ability we"
"19066510","19069590"," know that we have to do that and we know that we have to do it so that we can"
"19069590","19072290"," achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve which is an extended period to stay in"
"19072290","19075030"," very strong labor market conditions for the penitol we know that the fact that we come this far"
"19075030","19082670"," lets us really proceed carefully so I think you know that's that's the end we're trying to achieve"
"19082670","19094530"," um I wouldn't want to handicap the likelihood of it though it's not up to me to do that Nick"
"19094530","19095630"," Tamarose of the Wall Street Journal. "
"19095870","19100510"," Oh but boy Nick Tamarose you and Vice Chair Williams have indicated that sufficiently restrictive"
"19100510","19106210"," will be judged on a real rather than nominal basis implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next"
"19106210","19111090"," year provided further compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside."
"19111610","19118790"," Is the FOMC focused on targeting a real level of policy restriction and can you explain what would"
"19118790","19124710"," constitute enough evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while"
"19124710","19127070"," keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive?"
"19128450","19132770"," I mean yes we we understand that it's a real rate that will matter and that needs to be"
"19132770","19140470"," sufficiently restrictive um and again I would say you know you know sufficiently restrictive only"
"19140470","19141310"," when you see it."
"19141710","19147730"," It's not something you've got to arrive at for the previous level earlier in session at 441 and so"
"19147730","19152250"," where are we going to view low there for 4147 you know through a combination of the you know the"
"19152250","19158330"," unwinding of the pandemic related demand and supply distortions and monetary policies work in"
"19158330","19162150"," suppressing demand or or alleviating very high demand. "
"19162530","19166090"," The combination of those two things remember the conversation earlier that we had today where"
"19166090","19169870"," you'll have two or three moments inflation coming down it's prince where they reprice throughout"
"19169870","19173730"," the course of the day so you get the first rip holiday effects of it in non housing services."
"19173730","19177030"," We're going to do the same thing a second time and then you're going to actually see that that that"
"19177030","19177350"," is working."
"19177350","19181010"," The same thing happen again at the close and tomorrow at the OPEC. "
"19181330","19186290"," I think well you know as we've said we want to reach that we want to reach something that we're"
"19186290","19193130"," confident uh it gets us to that level and I think confidence comes from seeing you know enough data"
"19193130","19199550"," that you feel like yes okay this feels like it we can we can for now decide that this is"
"19199550","19204690"," the right level and just agree to stay here we're not permanently deciding not to go higher but but"
"19204690","19208110"," we would let's say if we get to that level and then the question is how long do you stay"
"19208110","19210510"," at that level and that's a whole other set of questions."
"19210890","19216530"," For now the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there and we haven't"
"19216530","19224950"," we haven't gotten to a point so what we have to do here is we're going to need to review"
"19224950","19232470"," those charts that he showed that yet that's that's what we're about to say this year and even then"
"19232470","19237070"," it seems possible that we haven't discussed those charts that he was showing because in the media"
"19237070","19241610"," and at 3.7 they do matter I mean we already have a case to raise rates still at the"
"19241610","19245870"," current month that you were going to achieve the same real rate this is important to inflation the"
"19245870","19250510"," story is somewhat better than he's asking for from banks and he's asking the decision that we hold"
"19250510","19255070"," off you know at each meeting and certainly because of the last two meetings this year we're just"
"19255070","19260090"," going to depend on the totality of all the data so the inflation data the labor market data the"
"19260090","19265050"," growth data and are those charts real like a balance of risk and really only going to go that high"
"19265050","19270270"," we take all of that into account so I can't really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that"
"19270270","19275490"," it'll it'll be trying to reach a judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate"
"19275490","19281870"," hike overall and whether that would increase our confidence that that yes this is an appropriate"
"19281870","19286130"," movement it will help help us be more confident that we've gotten to the level that we need to get"
"19286130","19296060"," to thank you Chair Powell following up on"
"19296060","19302620"," next question actually John Williams the New York Fed president obviously has said things to be"
"19302620","19308780"," effective next year as we see inflation kind of again to next point as we see inflation coming down"
"19308780","19312640"," we're going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we're not squeezing the economy"
"19312640","19318420"," harder and harder over time and I wonder if that's basically the logic that you apply you know is"
"19318420","19322640"," that how you think about it and then I also wonder in the last press conference you said something"
"19322640","19327180"," to the effect of you know it's a full year out those discussions and people interpreted that to"
"19327180","19332760"," mean that you didn't see a possibility of a rate cut in the first half of next year and I"
"19332760","19337300"," wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether you know how you're thinking about that timing"
"19337300","19343360"," no when so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals about about cutting I'm never"
"19343360","19348240"," intending to send a signal about timing I'm just answering them as as the question is expressed so"
"19348240","19352040"," it's actually a big shift and I'll see what we can say anyway sorry the first question was is that"
"19352040","19356500"," how yeah so we're as we go into the big shift right there that's the question we'll be asking they"
"19356500","19360660"," said they would always be you know taking into a court of lags and everything else we know about"
"19360660","19367580"," the economy and everything we know about monetary policy the time will come at some point and I'm"
"19367580","19373940"," not saying when that it's it's appropriate to cut part of that may be that real rates are rising"
"19373940","19379480"," because inflation is coming down part of it just may be that it'll be all the factors that we see"
"19379480","19384200"," in the economy and you know that time will certainly come at some point and what you see is us"
"19384200","19389580"," writing down you know a year ahead estimates of what that might be and you know there's just you"
"19389580","19393740"," know there's so much uncertainty around that when we in the moment we'll do what we think makes"
"19393740","19398180"," sense no one will look back at this and say hey we made a plan it's not like that at"
"19398180","19402460"," all it's it this is it these are estimates made a year in advance they're highly uncertain and"
"19402460","19412240"," that's how it is he seems a little less thanks a much sure how do you think about the question"
"19412240","19417240"," of whether the strong GDP growth we've been seeing is driven by excess demand versus supply side"
"19417240","19423560"," factors productivity labor force growth and relatedly if GDP keeps coming in hot even in the"
"19423560","19431820"," absence of inflation resurgence with that on its own be a reason to consider more tightening so on"
"19431820","19437760"," your first question I mean we're looking at GDP very very carefully to try to understand really"
"19437760","19443180"," what's the direction of it what's what's what's driving it is a lot of consumer spending it's just"
"19443180","19453160"," like running good very robust in it's in spending so that is you know that's how we're looking at"
"19453160","19458860"," it sorry your second question was there's GP stays hot but without inflation it's not fucking hot I"
"19458860","19463920"," think the question will be GDP is not a mandate right the maximum employment price stability of the"
"19463920","19469100"," mandate that's a fucking bear right there it was what GDP is hot it should be at 0.005 percent"
"19469100","19473720"," that we see in GDP is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation"
"19473720","19479560"," that's going to be the question it's not it's not a question about GDP on its own it's you you"
"19479560","19484720"," know you're expecting to see this improvement GDP is running hot it needs to be worse balancing in"
"19484720","19490800"," the labor market and inflation moving back to 2% in a sustainable way we have to have confidence in"
"19490800","19498140"," that and you know we'd be looking at GDP just just to the extent that it threatens one or both"
"19498140","19507240"," of those Hi Victoria Wieder with Politico yeah that's a big question right"
"19507240","19516280"," now we see rising oil prices we see auto workers striking where's the looming very real possibility"
"19516280","19521340"," of a government shutdown and I was just wondering if each of those things could you talk about how"
"19521340","19524780"," you're thinking about how that might affect over of course for the Fed and the economy not a lot of"
"19524780","19529520"," time left for that right there is a long list and you had some of them but you know it's"
"19529520","19535740"," the strike it's government shutdown resumption of student loan payments higher long-term rates oil"
"19535740","19539920"," price shock you know you can there are a lot of things that you can you can look at and"
"19539920","19544600"," you know so what we try to do is assess all of them and sounds like a hit asking a"
"19544600","19549800"," question ultimately there's so much uncertainty around but love that daddy to start with the strike"
"19549800","19556560"," first of all we absolutely don't comment on the strike as we have no view on the strike one way"
"19556560","19562020"," or the other but we do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs so"
"19562020","19566640"," do you guys realize you know they've shut down things out of history all the time without a strike"
"19566640","19571420"," you can all the time it could affect you look you look back at the street's production before the"
"19571420","19577820"," protest strike hiring and inflation they were forcing workers to work six days a week mandatory"
"19577820","19585680"," overtime and how quickly production can make up there's no economic impact right now a strike and"
"19585680","19594900"," oh so you just have to leave that uncertain and that's just glossing over right there that's just"
"19594900","19599300"," news for you and i can will be learning you and i to consume the next inter meeting that that"
"19599300","19604640"," isn't traditionally that is just for economic effects fucking new cycle bullshit you know energy"
"19604640","19612060"," prices being hired that's that is a significant thing we energy prices being up can affect spending"
"19612060","19618640"," it can affect over time a sustained period of higher of higher energy prices can affect consumer"
"19618640","19624220"," expectations about inflation we tend to look through short-term volatility and look at look at core"
"19624220","19628220"," inflation like i like but so the question is how long or it's like how about a whole higher price"
"19628220","19633100"," is sustained we have to we have to take those macroeconomic effects doing their job well it's doing"
"19633100","19638180"," its job those are some of them i'm not sure if i hit them all but i mean ultimately you"
"19638180","19643920"," know you're coming into this with an economy that appears to have a significant momentum and that's"
"19643920","19647940"," that's what we start with and we but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned Greg"
"19651300","19655820"," Torres from Bloomberg News i was a little surprised chair about it here you say that a soft landing"
"19655820","19662960"," is not a primary objective this economy seeing added supply suppliers yeah i would think a point"
"19662960","19668240"," here really quick let's guys talk and we have primate you got a report i live here these suppliers"
"19668240","19675480"," they go on work they go on pauses all the time the auto structure uh the suppliers the small"
"19675480","19681320"," engineering companies and since uh these auto makers we go on don't forget to strike we may have"
"19681320","19685200"," higher productivity they have shut down all the time they don't tell you about they've got a"
"19685200","19691340"," reduction of workforce hours for the actual blow manufacturers as well in a recession uh if you"
"19691340","19695860"," guys don't believe that we you think i'm lying to i'll get to a link right now hold on a"
"19695860","19700040"," second in one quick second so are you taking this you can ask these guys they got i got something"
"19700040","19704820"," for you to ask some people because they'll answer you honestly a soft landing is a primary"
"19704820","19710040"," objective and i did not say otherwise i mean that's that's what we've been trying to do you want"
"19710040","19715060"," the ins the deal which you're not going to find i'm into it i got something the real point though"
"19715060","19722220"," is uh the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability because the record is clear"
"19722220","19727340"," on that if you you don't restore price stability inflation comes back and you go through you can"
"19727340","19734780"," have a long period where the economy is just very uncertain and it'll affect growth it'll affect"
"19734780","19740160"," all kinds of things it can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the"
"19740160","19744740"," Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again so the best thing we can do for everyone we"
"19744740","19751640"," believe is to restore price stability i think now today we actually uh you know we we have the"
"19751640","19756940"," ability to be careful at this point and move carefully and that's what we're planning to do um so"
"19756940","19762840"," we fully appreciate that you know the benefits of being able to continue what we see already which"
"19762840","19768260"," is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing uh you know an"
"19768260","19778560"," important large increase in unemployment which has been typical of other tightening cycles so hi"
"19778560","19783700"," uh thank you chris ruegebrad associated press uh when you look at the disinflation that has taken"
"19783700","19789180"," place so far do you see it mostly as a result of uh what some economists are calling the low"
"19789180","19795660"," hanging fruit uh such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions or is"
"19795660","19802280"," it more a broad inflation disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the"
"19802280","19809300"," economy thank you so if i if i understood your question it's i would say it this way i think"
"19809300","19814920"," we knew from the time from before when we left it off certainly by the time we left we knew"
"19814920","19823020"," that bringing inflation back down was going to take um as i call it the unwinding of these um"
"19823020","19828420"," distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response so"
"19828420","19833940"," that unwinding was going to be important in addition monetary policy was going to help it was going"
"19833940","19840860"," to help supply side heal by by cooling demand off and just in general a lot better aligning supply"
"19840860","19846320"," with demand so those two forces were always going to be important it's very hard to pull them apart"
"19846320","19851800"," they work together i do think both of them are at work now and i think they're at work in"
"19851800","19859380"," a way that shows you the progress that we that we are seeing Michael McKee from Bloomberg"
"19859380","19874140"," television radio in june you forecast a five you"
"19874140","19878440"," think both of them are at work now and i think they're at work in a way that shows you"
"19878440","19884080"," the progress that we that we are seeing Michael McKee from Bloomberg television radio in june you"
"19884080","19886940"," forecast a five what would justify that last move because the median forecast is for lower"
"19886940","19890340"," inflation and get all the known unknowns that you face how much confidence do you have can"
"19890340","19893340"," investors have where the american people have in your forecast well forecast are highly uncertain"
"19893340","19897260"," forecasting is very difficult forecasters are humbled at much of the humbled up but to get to your"
"19897260","19904360"," question though what's happened is growth has come in stronger right stronger than expected and"
"19904360","19912460"," that's required higher rates unemployment you know you also see that the the ultimate unemployment"
"19912460","19916580"," rate is not as high but that that's really because of what we've been seeing in the labor market"
"19916580","19921080"," we've seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher"
"19921080","19927180"," unemployment so we're continuing that trend in terms of inflation you are seeing the last three"
"19927180","19933460"," readings are a very very good readings it's only three readings you know we were well aware that we"
"19933460","19937980"," need to see more than three readings but if you look at june july and august you're looking at you"
"19937980","19943740"," know really significant declines in core inflation largely in the good sector also to some extended"
"19943740","19948980"," housing services and just a little in non-housing services because of the three buckets headline of"
"19948980","19956420"," course has come way down largely due to lower energy prices some of which is now reversing so i"
"19956420","19962380"," think people should know that that economic forecasting is um is very difficult and these are"
"19962380","19968580"," highly uncertain forecasts but these are these are our forecasters you know they're they're they're"
"19968580","19972800"," we have very high quality people working on these forecasts and i think they stand up well against"
"19972800","19979460"," other forecasters but just the nature of the businesses the economy is very difficult to forecast"
"19979460","19990690"," that you have what justified not moving today and"
"19990690","19997650"," what could justify moving in the future if you think well i i think we have come very far very"
"19997650","20001810"," fast in some way that's going on right now the raises that we've made i think it was important at"
"20001810","20006550"," the beginning to move quickly in the presser correct the from the present and i think as we get"
"20006550","20011950"," closer to the rate that we think the stance of monitoring is that i got uh it's not my it's"
"20011950","20017170"," not my end bring inflation down i've got uh uh tool fiber i've got commercial risk move fiber i've"
"20017170","20021770"," got to buy dope shit and the risk of overtaking a little glass wire that runs in of undertightening"
"20021770","20027010"," that becomes more equal and i think the the natural common sense thing to do is as you approach"
"20027010","20031210"," that spy park right now not doing anything as you get closer to it and that that's what we're doing"
"20031210","20037270"," so we're we're taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more"
"20037270","20044430"," carefully now as we as we as we sort of find our way to to the right level of restriction"
"20044430","20053290"," that we need to get inflation back down to two percent thank you chair pal jennifer shawn burger"
"20053290","20061090"," with yahoo finance with your focus on eurover your pce isn't it true that base effects are huge and"
"20061090","20066470"," that by the time you meet in november that it's more likely that you'll have a low pce number that"
"20066470","20071430"," would make you feel more comfortable and secondly how would the lack of key is the press conference"
"20071430","20075770"," a little longer than expected so it's three thirty regardless of the press we're gonna check for"
"20075770","20080030"," you if we were to have expectations in the rest of the week yeah i missed the first question what"
"20080030","20085590"," was it miss what factors the base factors don't forget that the downside move the downside expected"
"20085590","20093830"," move is 440 45 so in the upside we're looking just month right here's four forty six eighty two"
"20093830","20098410"," with the increase was in a prior month so you're right when you go back three six and twelve months"
"20098410","20103050"," you get base factors but we we can we can we can adjust for that in terms of not getting"
"20103050","20109530"," data you know again we don't we don't comment on government shutdowns it it's possible if there is"
"20109530","20114950"," a government shutdown and it lasts through the the next meeting then it's possible we wouldn't we"
"20114950","20119250"," wouldn't be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get and we you know we would just"
"20119250","20123350"," have to deal with that good question i don't know it's hard for me to say in advance how that"
"20123350","20127890"," would affect that meeting yeah it would depend on all kinds of factors that i don't know that now"
"20127890","20137250"," but it's certainly a reality that that that's a possibility as those kind of fall out of the"
"20137250","20141410"," equation through the next couple of readings by november would you feel uncomfortable at that point"
"20141410","20150010"," you know yes i mean if you're looking if we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a"
"20150010","20154950"," given month right and you know that's what we're looking at and month by month what's the reading"
"20154950","20162490"," and you know i think i think what we're really looking at is there's a tendency to look at you"
"20162490","20167810"," know shorter and shorter maturities but they're incredibly volatile they can be misleading that's"
"20167810","20172340"," why we look at but i think in this situation where it looks like we've had a bit of a"
"20172340","20176900"," turn in inflation starting in june we're also looking at six months and even three months but"
"20176900","20182240"," really six months inflation so you're looking at it over that period and over longer periods that"
"20182240","20186540"," that's the right way to go and we don't we don't need to be in a hurry in in getting"
"20186540","20195000"," to a conclusion about what to do we can let the data evolve uh so weakness inside spruce right now"
"20195000","20200440"," uh chairbell with fox business so i want to focus back in on oil prices um we're seeing oil prices"
"20200440","20204940"," as you mentioned move up and that's pushing the price of gas so how does that factor into your"
"20204940","20210720"," decision to raise rates or not because the last two inflation reports pce and cpi is the overall"
"20210720","20211800"," inflation is actually good."
"20212460","20218460"," Right so um you know energy prices are very important for the consumer this this can affect"
"20218460","20223140"," consumer spending it certainly can affect consumer sentiment i mean gas prices are one of the big"
"20223140","20228480"," things that that affects consumer sentiment it really comes down to how persistent how sustained"
"20228480","20235100"," these energy prices are we the reason why we look at core inflation which excludes food and energy"
"20235100","20241680"," is that energy goes up and down like that and it doesn't energy energy prices mostly mostly don't"
"20241680","20246640"," contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is and hence don't tell you much about where"
"20246640","20252160"," inflation is really going however we're well aware though that you know if energy prices increase"
"20252160","20258040"," and stay high that'll have an effect on spending and and if it may have an effect on on uh"
"20258040","20263340"," consumer expectations of inflation things like that that's just things we have to monitor just"
"20263340","20268240"," added some temper 20 second um more 46 more and more this on the credit card for friday of the"
"20268240","20273400"," consumer seeing you know record credit spending how long do you think the consumer can manage that"
"20273400","20279500"," debt at higher interest rates now and are you concerned about it a dead bubble related to that so"
"20279500","20286500"," to finish my prior thought i was saying that's why we we tend to look through energy moves that we"
"20286500","20292200"," that we can see as as short-term volatility you know turning the consumer credit you know of course"
"20292200","20298460"," we watch that carefully consumer distress measures of distress among consumers were at historic"
"20298460","20304860"," lows quite recently you know after during and after the pandemic expected downside move and"
"20304860","20311000"," tomorrow was or 45 just be careful about what's down below s1 they're not they're not at"
"20311000","20315720"," troublingly high levels they're just kind of moving back up to what was the typical in the pre"
"20315720","20325570"," pandemic era hi jean young with m&i market news yields along"
"20325570","20331090"," the treasury curve have risen to their highest in years what is the fed's view about what's been"
"20331090","20336710"," driving that increase in recent weeks and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations"
"20336710","20346050"," and how much to technical factors so you're right um you know rates have moved up significantly i"
"20346050","20353370"," think uh it's always hard to say precisely but it's most most people do a common decomposition of"
"20353370","20357210"," the increase and they'll they'll the view will be it's not it's not mostly about inflation"
"20357210","20363670"," expectations it's mostly about other things you know either term premium or real yields and it's"
"20363670","20367930"," it's hard to be precise about this of course everyone's got models that'll give you a very precise"
"20367930","20374010"," answer but they give you different answers so but essentially they're they're they're moving up"
"20374010","20378790"," because it's not because of inflation it's because probably it'll probably have something to do"
"20378790","20383550"," with stronger growth i would say more more supply of treasuries but you know the common"
"20383550","20394760"," explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense Kyle Campbell"
"20394760","20400880"," American banker thank you for taking the questions um just two on on housing you've said slower"
"20400880","20406740"," shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as you also remember"
"20406740","20412540"," that the first minor question is they're four four two five point one five particularly the second"
"20412540","20419740"," minor well or the excuse me the uh the owner is about what the football is at 440 versus 4400"
"20419740","20425740"," so my question is how much of the effort right now we're coming into the first minor well on SPX"
"20425740","20433080"," hinges on housing supply and then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated"
"20433080","20438400"," by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were expected downside food"
"20438400","20447060"," into tomorrow 440 45 almost there 40 89 87 to that lower bound in the future so on the supply"
"20447060","20454500"," point of course supply is very important over time in in setting house prices and and for that"
"20454500","20460460"," matter rents and so and supply is coming down in a s one right here adding another but in terms"
"20460460","20467200"," of of where inflation's going in the near term though same strike 446 no a lot of this is leases"
"20467200","20475280"," that are running off and then being resigned or released at a level that's that's not as not it"
"20475280","20480420"," won't be that much higher it would have it you're right s one right now on s and p five"
"20480420","20486820"," hundred below or at the same level so as those leases are rolling over we're seeing what we expect"
"20486820","20496300"," which is measured s two six at four thirty eight sixty three your second question was the lock-ins"
"20496300","20505660"," how much is that affecting things really affect your decisions to potentially bring rates down to"
"20505660","20509860"," their lower bound in the future sort of creating that that's sort of bubble of buying and then a"
"20509860","20515560"," lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market I think we look at the I would look at the"
"20515560","20522640"," lock-in this the idea being that people are in in very low mortgage very low rate mortgages and if"
"20522640","20529980"," they even if they want to move a total of 200 contracts right now on 446 c for Friday they"
"20529980","20536120"," would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive play a role in in in our future"
"20536120","20543360"," decisions in a in a future tight in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates and"
"20543360","20549200"," no I don't think it would I mean I don't think that's I think we'd be looking at what the"
"20549200","20554100"," you know fundamentally what what rates does the economy need in it and you know in an emergency"
"20554100","20561100"," like the pandemic or during the global financial crisis you you know they you have to cut rates to"
"20561100","20566600"," the point that you have to do what you can to support the economy so I wouldn't I wouldn't think"
"20566600","20570880"," that that would be a reason for us not to do that it's just a note for you we're sitting"

"20729320","20736620"," interest rates why is that many candidate explanations possibly a number of them make sense one one"
"20736620","20742740"," is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had"

"20748560","20753440"," the savings rate for consumers has come down a lot the question is whether that's sustainable that"

"21457460","21464060"," them out today is what matters that he's breaking out charts saying hey this is what we expect"
"21464060","21469320"," we're going to expect to hold rates higher for longer we're going to expect to hold them into we're"
"21469320","21475260"," going to expect to hold them into not just next year but likely into the end of next year he's"

"21488080","21495660"," trying to show a path in the path some of the paths that he's showing don't make sense uh I'm"
"21495660","21500880"," kind of scratching man especially in the unemployment uh track that he's looking for to the upside"
"21500880","21507620"," so we will take a look tomorrow at the unemployment rate we'll take a look at the rate of inflation"

"23724330","23730310"," and for that move if it's possible there's like a probably like a there's a there's a 20 to 30"
"23730310","23735850"," percent chance maybe a 30 percent chance that we could start like heavily selling net right now uh"
"23735850","23741050"," there's a fair chance of it it's not great but there's a fair chance but there's a greater chance"
"23741050","23747290"," that we squeeze uh just for the just for the sake of dealers and then uh we we make the"
"23747290","23754220"," way down so oh no no no what do"
"23754220","23763860"," you guys got from here see what you guys are saying here okay"
"23763860","23768100"," i got your chat uh right i agree the pause bearish from suggesting there is the market drops in the"
"23768100","23773120"," mid-october market pivots in a year bullish on a rate increased signal yeah you know chat i've"
"23773120","23778100"," heard that argument i've heard the argument that we slammed down into four 30 and we just continued"
"23778100","23783760"," trying to the upside uh let's look at that real quick how about this let's that's a good one Chad"
"23783760","23792100"," so let me bring that one up really quick uh let's go the weebo chart right here so if we're"
"23792100","23798180"," following trend right so here's your 430 right here let's say we close up even this gap down below"
"23799600","23805820"," right watch this closely here okay so let's pretend let's pretend right now we keep going down"
"23805820","23813480"," right we blast through maybe if you're super bear we close all that believe and give the bear that"
"23813480","23818300"," right there okay but let's say it doesn't matter let's say we go down here it doesn't matter if we"
"23818300","23823420"," go right here doesn't matter if we go right here let's say we do either one of these right either"
"23823420","23828940"," one doesn't matter uh so your thesis is that we continue up in the end of the year right so"
"23828940","23836380"," let's say we squeeze higher so we squeeze right on 430 ish so we come right up here we squeeze"
"23836380","23846160"," up right you really can't make that thesis real you can't really make that"
"23846160","23856120"," thesis real unless you retake 443 right like you have to you have"
"23856120","23862500"," to retake this right so let's look at this from perspective of pretend this is a five-minute chart"
"23862500","23870040"," right i see your thesis here but my point to you still stands right where this thing hold on a"
"23870040","23880010"," second here let me draw this out so it's exact here i don't want to make mince words here"
"23880010","23886990"," right you you break down right so if this was a five-minute chart you told me i'm bullish here"
"23886990","23892010"," right there you tell me you're bullish i would say yeah maybe right maybe to right there you're"
"23892010","23899150"," bullish but your long-term thesis is not bullish the only way you have a long-term thesis of"
"23899150","23907570"," bullish here uh would be if you break above right your previous high right there right you come"
"23907570","23914650"," back down look at all the work you need to do to have that thesis you need to come back"
"23914650","23922810"," down right there then you actually need it to turn up right you know what i'm saying you got that"
"23922810","23928930"," blast down you come up here down and then only then can you have the end of the year both"
"23928930","23936350"," thesis your end of the year both thesis you need all of this to happen right you need all that"
"23936350","23941430"," shit to happen then i think you can give that end of year both thesis your both thesis would be"
"23941430","23951830"," sound to me your both thesis your bull t would be sound it would be a sound argument but"
"23951830","23958310"," right now it's not right right now the art right now the almost the guarantee is that we blast down"
"23958310","23967550"," at a minimum break this right here uh and the more likely scenario is we sell this"
"23967550","23977470"," the more probable scenario you sell that down you can already see it right i can show you countless"
"23977470","23985630"," examples of this on any time frame any time frame it can show you countless examples of how this"
"23985630","23990870"," how this goes and what ends up happening is they trap you they trap you they trap you and then"
"23990870","24007300"," you get your bloodbath down there so unless this unless this is flipped upside down no no yeah"
"24007300","24013980"," you agree with any confirmation for that trade um so Chad you need a bunch of work to be done"

"24077730","24084210"," in covid uh when we had the crash they gave you a chance to get out of the market so"
"24084210","24090130"," leading into covid the market was anticipated to roll over if you're a new market participant if"
"24090130","24099250"," you did not trade before 2020 the covid crash there was an expectation of a roll coming already but"
