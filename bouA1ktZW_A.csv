"bouA1ktZW_A","510320","511200"," underneath us here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","511680","513360"," and you're seeing that we are riding"
"bouA1ktZW_A","513360","514720"," back up on top of that"

"bouA1ktZW_A","533280","535760"," right it's supportive to this market"
"bouA1ktZW_A","535760","536960"," we're doing that right now"
"bouA1ktZW_A","536960","540000"," so going back to this mainstream right"
"bouA1ktZW_A","540000","541520"," stream right here right that the point"
"bouA1ktZW_A","541520","543120"," they're trying to make too is that"
"bouA1ktZW_A","543120","544720"," somewhere over here right"
"bouA1ktZW_A","545600","547120"," there's some giant support"
"bouA1ktZW_A","547840","548800"," in this area okay"
"bouA1ktZW_A","549920","552080"," a lot of market was bought yesterday"
"bouA1ktZW_A","553040","555280"," so the bulls really want to climb over this"
"bouA1ktZW_A","555840","557360"," and continue their move higher"
"bouA1ktZW_A","557920","559600"," we know that we're in positive gamma"
"bouA1ktZW_A","560480","562240"," that means that we're not selling rips"
"bouA1ktZW_A","562240","563360"," that we're buying dips"
"bouA1ktZW_A","565360","567120"," and if the bulls can maintain here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","567120","568400"," at any point right"
"bouA1ktZW_A","568400","570080"," every time we have some news releases"
"bouA1ktZW_A","570080","572000"," today you'll see a you'll see weakness"
"bouA1ktZW_A","572000","573120"," in those cells"
"bouA1ktZW_A","573120","574720"," but but i want you to be aware"
"bouA1ktZW_A","574720","577360"," of or that we're in a supportive market"
"bouA1ktZW_A","577360","577760"," right here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","581120","582160"," let's see here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","582160","583760"," we don't get into an unsupportive market"
"bouA1ktZW_A","583760","585200"," until we break below this pivot"
"bouA1ktZW_A","587760","589680"," where does it where does it want to head"
"bouA1ktZW_A","589680","590720"," where is up"
"bouA1ktZW_A","591920","593920"," our first major resistance is going to be"
"bouA1ktZW_A","593920","596240"," 401-53 i believe"
"bouA1ktZW_A","597040","599040"," and then up here at 403-27"
"bouA1ktZW_A","600000","601760"," and the big boy way above"
"bouA1ktZW_A","601760","603680"," and the reason why we're up here is because"
"bouA1ktZW_A","603680","605920"," if we start breaking above here today"
"bouA1ktZW_A","606560","608560"," if we're able to get past this stuff here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","609120","611040"," all this garbage you're going to get a squeeze"
"bouA1ktZW_A","611040","612000"," because you're going to catch"
"bouA1ktZW_A","613840","615600"," all these shorts that are in here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","615600","618240"," you'll catch them off guard big giant green bars"
"bouA1ktZW_A","619040","619840"," to the north"
"bouA1ktZW_A","619840","622240"," now one other thing i want you to be aware of today is"
"bouA1ktZW_A","623920","625040"," two two parts"
"bouA1ktZW_A","625040","628240"," there's no need to trade events"
"bouA1ktZW_A","629440","630800"," if if i had a choice"
"bouA1ktZW_A","631920","632880"," earnings"
"bouA1ktZW_A","632880","635920"," earnings wouldn't be a or wouldn't be an event any longer"
"bouA1ktZW_A","635920","637600"," they used to not be an event in the market"
"bouA1ktZW_A","637600","638160"," now they are"
"bouA1ktZW_A","639280","641520"," we seem to turn everything into events these days"
"bouA1ktZW_A","642560","643840"," typically if you"
"bouA1ktZW_A","646320","648960"," go back if you think about what the lead up to"
"bouA1ktZW_A","648960","649920"," an event"
"bouA1ktZW_A","649920","652160"," everybody gets pumped up pumped up pumped up"
"bouA1ktZW_A","653520","656080"," and just think about the after effect of that event"
"bouA1ktZW_A","656640","657120"," if we"
"bouA1ktZW_A","658560","659920"," let me show you this here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","664160","666720"," we tend to come back to the mean after an event"
"bouA1ktZW_A","667360","669760"," so after all this noise in here it's not like"
"bouA1ktZW_A","669760","671520"," you can't make big money in this event"
"bouA1ktZW_A","671520","673440"," when you have moves like this"
"bouA1ktZW_A","673520","676640"," but trend usually continues or it's trend change"
"bouA1ktZW_A","677440","679040"," you have an opportunity in here"
"bouA1ktZW_A","680640","683680"," after the event to just with the continuation"
"bouA1ktZW_A","683680","684960"," of what happens in the market"
"bouA1ktZW_A","685840","688080"," we didn't get caught on the wrong side of a trade"

"bouA1ktZW_A","4519560","4523560"," I try to catch the second bar."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4523560","4528560"," Normally I try to catch it like this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4528560","4534560"," And if the next bar so if this bar comes down here and touches right we're good."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4534560","4536560"," The second bar is where I usually grab it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4536560","4540560"," If you see the third bar doesn't touch it we're going higher."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4541560","4545560"," But if you see that second bar continue to touch down here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4545560","4550560"," Continue to touch down here anytime you see that touch down below that's where you're seeing your."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4550560","4553560"," Usually I wait for the second bar."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4553560","4555560"," And you're not seeing it here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4555560","4559560"," So you're seeing a strong this is a strong consolidation right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4559560","4561560"," Hold on a second here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4561560","4564560"," So the first bar right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4564560","4566560"," So move this aside."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4589560","4593560"," If I don't start to see these bars coming down right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4593560","4597560"," Then I'll put a I'll draw a heart you guys see me draw the horizontal lines right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4597560","4600560"," I'll then draw that yellow horizontal line right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4600560","4601560"," I turn it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4601560","4603560"," You guys have seen me do this in the past right boom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4603560","4604560"," There goes my yellow horizontal."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4604560","4605560"," This is strong right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4605560","4607560"," This is stronger the consolidation."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4607560","4612560"," This is a move that looks like it's going to blast off to the fucking moon."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4612560","4614560"," Like watch me be proved wrong right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4614560","4618560"," But this is much stronger than a this downward consolidation right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4618560","4621560"," So now let's say I get you get the red bar down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4621560","4623560"," Let's say the red bar comes down and touches."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4624560","4629560"," It'll just keep extending down if I have to adjust this white line at that point to the second bar I will."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4629560","4631560"," I don't know if that's making any sense."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4631560","4634560"," We're very we're very strong at this moment right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4634560","4637560"," Does it make sense?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","4637560","4639560"," I don't know if that's made any of that making sense."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4639560","4641560"," We'll do a we'll do a chart on."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4641560","4644560"," We'll do a chart or a candle reading."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4644560","4648560"," I haven't done candle reading in a long long fucking time but."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4649560","4653560"," I have learned how to read candles when I was younger."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4653560","4657560"," And so I still use that stuff in my trading today."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4657560","4659560"," So this is very strong right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4661560","4663560"," We're blasting higher right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4663560","4665560"," Blasting we're sticking and we're moving."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4665560","4666560"," We don't want to see a reversal up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4666560","4669560"," We don't want to see the double top on a blast up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4670560","4678560"," See how fast they snap those lines."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4678560","4680560"," Would it."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4698560","4701560"," They don't want to pay these fucking calls, man."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4701560","4703560"," I'm going to have to swim."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4703560","4707560"," They want me to take some risk on and buy like 404s and 403s."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4707560","4709560"," 407s and 408s."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4709560","4710560"," They don't."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4710560","4711560"," They're saying we're not going there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4711560","4712560"," Those are like four cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4712560","4714560"," Two cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4714560","4716560"," Actually, three cents for a four or seven."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4716560","4718560"," One penny for a four away."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4718560","4720560"," So they're like hell no."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4722560","4724560"," They're like we're not put where they're like we're not."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4728560","4730560"," This yellow bar and this stuff earlier."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4732560","4734560"," Maybe I was talking to myself without the screener up."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4735560","4736560"," How do I pull?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","4736560","4737560"," How do I pull these?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","4737560","4738560"," We'll do a class on this stuff."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4738560","4739560"," How to read the candles."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4741560","4745560"," And at some point we'll talk about how to read candles where it's going."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4746560","4747560"," What's consolidation?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","4747560","4748560"," What's distribution?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","4750560","4751560"," So this is strong."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4751560","4752560"," I'm going to be watching this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4755560","4756560"," I switched from a white."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4757560","4758560"," Downward consolidation."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4758560","4760560"," I want to see this hold right here and build."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4761560","4762560"," Support."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4763560","4764560"," I want to see this is what I'm looking for."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4793560","4794560"," Beast mode."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4795560","4797560"," Should be some resistance here at 180."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4797560","4799560"," You'll see me just so you guys know too."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4800560","4802560"," You will see even though we've got a target up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4802560","4805560"," You like at 180 you'll see resistance."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4805560","4806560"," I like the zeros."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4806560","4810560"," You'll see resistance at zeros fives and that's outside of."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4811560","4813560"," You won't see it on a chart."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4815560","4819560"," But at like 180 you'll see resistance at 185."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4819560","4821560"," You'll see resistance up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4821560","4822560"," That is not like a."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4824560","4826560"," Level or retracement number."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4827560","4831560"," So like at 180 175 170."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4831560","4834560"," So when you guys are trading a ticker or spy anything like that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4834560","4835560"," Put in all your stuff."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4835560","4837560"," But in the back of your mind just know."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4837560","4843560"," That there are predetermined sell and buy orders on the fives and zeros."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4843560","4845560"," Any of the common numbers."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4845560","4847560"," Be conscious of that as well."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4847560","4852560"," While you're doing your you know magical pivot support resistance lines."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4852560","4856560"," Your Elliot wave theory fucking counts and."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4861560","4864560"," Whatever you whatever you're following."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4865560","4867560"," Just know at 180 there will be sellers."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4868560","4871560"," Know that at 185 up here there'll be sellers."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4873560","4876560"," You just want to cloud up your chart I don't normally."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4876560","4879560"," I don't normally look at these numbers these zeros and fives."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4879560","4881560"," They think about on my head."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4882560","4885560"," Without without without accounting for them."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4888560","4893560"," But you can you want if you want to know else I'll snap them here for you."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4893560","4894560"," So you have them."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4902560","4905560"," On the spy you see that squeeze higher."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4906560","4908560"," What did I say to you just a few moments ago."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4910560","4914560"," What did I say about that being a strong base to squeeze 40274."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4915560","4916560"," Nice tag above."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4916560","4918560"," I'm probably going to pull the plug."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4919560","4921560"," Take a break."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4921560","4925560"," So the year at a five day high versus the US dollar last up zero spot."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4925560","4927560"," Seven three percent."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4931560","4933560"," If you're long here I wouldn't be."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4949560","4951560"," Book map saying it's going back up."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4951560","4956560"," I think it's a risky trade after that tag above it four or two 74."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4957560","4959560"," I look like a liquidity grab above."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4962560","4963560"," We'll see."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4966560","4968560"," I'm going to take a break here from."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4969560","4970560"," I'm going to take a break here from."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4973560","4974560"," That was pretty wild."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4974560","4975560"," Like I've got the adrenaline."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4978560","4979560"," That tag right there."

"bouA1ktZW_A","4992560","4994560"," To area that liquidity grab above."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4994560","4997560"," They could still trade higher one more time up there but."
"bouA1ktZW_A","4999560","5001560"," Yeah, I don't like that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5001560","5002560"," I don't like that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5002560","5004560"," That was an immediate push down right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5005560","5009560"," So he green barded straight up and they said hell no you're not going up there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5013560","5015560"," We could be in a reversal right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5016560","5019560"," So if we're going to reverse your bear out there you're looking for a reversal."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5019560","5020560"," That could be it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5021560","5024560"," You're going to be looking for VWAP down below here again for another entry."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5024560","5025560"," I'll be looking for an entry down here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5026560","5028560"," If we break through VWAP."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5029560","5031560"," Next level is right around 400."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5035560","5038560"," You got VWAP coming right into this 40163."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5039560","5040560"," So we'll see if we can grab it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5042560","5043560"," There goes the reversal."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5050560","5052560"," I'm thinking we're reversing the market right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5056560","5057560"," We'll see what's up."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5058560","5059560"," See if this is a reversal."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5060560","5062560"," Got another liquidity grab down below."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5062560","5064560"," It was a pretty big fucking move right there right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5065560","5066560"," What is that a 20 point move?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","5066560","5068560"," No, that's 10 point move in like five seconds."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5075560","5076560"," Let me see what you guys are saying in chat."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5076560","5084560"," I know do we just log out now and play hockey or what?"

"bouA1ktZW_A","5102560","5103560"," Oh, Jill, you didn't get filled."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5104560","5106560"," Josh, you shall not pass."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5110560","5117560"," Well, so in the options chain right now, the market makers dealers are saying that there's no way we're getting a four away."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5117560","5118560"," You only got two pennies on it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5119560","5121560"," A penny actually can buy those calls."

"bouA1ktZW_A","5158560","5164560"," What the dealers are saying that the high side for today is going to be right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5171560","5172560"," On the low side."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5173560","5175560"," They're not giving shit to the bears."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5177560","5178560"," We're at this moment."

"bouA1ktZW_A","5193560","5194560"," That's pretty cheap."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5194560","5202560"," So, if we went down there, if we had like a bad minutes or something like that, I mean, it might be worth just, you know what, it might be worth buying up here is for the minutes."

"bouA1ktZW_A","5207560","5208560"," So, like."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5211560","5214560"," To buy like some fucking penny puts is a no brainer."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5215560","5217560"," We get the drop at two o'clock, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","5218560","5222560"," I mean, it's fucking they're free, right? They're basically free."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5225560","5226560"," Let's look and see."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5227560","5232560"," So, they're telling you that there's no way that we're so what's this down here, 396."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5233560","5235560"," So, 396 P's."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5236560","5240560"," Are nine cents eight cents right now. They're eight pennies."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5241560","5246560"," We have we swing calls here that go up and down 10 cents and five minutes."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5246560","5251560"," It's like they're telling you is that the market makers town is there ain't no way we're going down here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5253560","5254560"," For eight cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5254560","5255560"," Let's track that all day long."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5256560","5261560"," So, let's do like a paper trade. Let's do a mind trade."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5262560","5264560"," So, like liquidity grab up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5265560","5269560"," Um, at some point in here, let's grab some dirt cheap puts."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5273560","5276560"," Like eight center. Well, you know, let's not make them eight cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5276560","5281560"," If we can get them for like the problem with puts is if you get them too far outside the money, they still don't pay them."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5281560","5287560"," I always prefer puts more in the money than calls. Typically, not always. Sometimes I like calls the money to."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5288560","5292560"," Um, today, 11 a.m. Eastern summer expected to see the tax relief of bank."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5292560","5297560"," It takes release of Bank of England's pill. It was scheduled previously for 10 30 a.m. Eastern time."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5297560","5302560"," But it's been rescheduled for a 11 a.m. Eastern time to 10 minutes away now to get that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5303560","5305560"," Let's see at some point if we can just get some insurance."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5307560","5309560"," I don't know if I do the eight cent puts maybe."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5310560","5312560"," I'd really like to see like."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5313560","5317560"," Anyways, sometime in this area here, let's buy some, even if they just throw away."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5318560","5320560"," Throw a puts like just shits and giggles."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5321560","5323560"," Because if we do do this, if we do so."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5323560","5332560"," A Wall Street Journal on Twitter says the understands the EU and boss will turn back to oil price cap in the next few minutes."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5332560","5334560"," I'm going to turn that off for a second."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5334560","5339560"," The problem with these. So on these event days, if you squeeze, let's say you squeeze down here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5340560","5348560"," They'll like intentionally, they'll intentionally not go all the way down and be like just before."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5349560","5351560"," They'll stop just before like S one, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","5352560","5356560"," And like the eight cent puts for right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5356560","5358560"," They won't go to like 30, 40 cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5358560","5361560"," What they'll do is they'll go to like 12 cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5362560","5366560"," And if you don't, if you don't cashman soon enough, it'll swing back high again."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5367560","5373560"," And it'll go from like eight cents down to four cents and then it'll print eight cents finally down here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5373560","5375560"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","5376560","5385560"," So on these big swing days, it's always better to be or if we do get a swing, if we do get a plunge, it's always better to be in the money or close to in the money inputs."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5387560","5390560"," And then go, you know, they'll come way in the money and you get paid."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5390560","5393560"," So we'll see as this day unfolds, but."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5394560","5397560"," Even if you just throw one or two on or 10 on."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5398560","5405560"," Somewhere in here just just for this end of day, two o'clock in the afternoon for shits and giggles, you can still be buying calls and stuff."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5406560","5411560"," Looking to buy a move up, but I would consider like toss just a couple."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5412560","5414560"," Ten pack on 20 pack on."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5415560","5418560"," Just for shits and giggles as we head into two o'clock up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5419560","5423560"," And I would make them in the money. I'd probably make them three ninety eights."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5424560","5427560"," I think that's a fair. Let's look. Let's look in the options chain."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5428560","5429560"," You're ninety eights."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5431560","5432560"," The other twenty cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5435560","5437560"," If you're a bear listening right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5440560","5446560"," Somewhere in here somewhere in the next two o'clock, we got some volatility coming in right there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5447560","5449560"," Somewhere in here, twenty cent put."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5450560","5452560"," It's probably going to be a fucking sweet spot."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5452560","5455560"," So if you're a bear ready, I haven't given a bear trade in a long time."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5455560","5457560"," Four days, I'm going to bear trade."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5458560","5459560"," Somewhere in here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5461560","5463560"," Start looking at three ninety eights."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5465560","5467560"," There are nineteen eighteen cents right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5468560","5469560"," Keep your eyes on them."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5470560","5471560"," Three ninety eights."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5472560","5474560"," Sounds about three ninety nines, maybe."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5475560","5476560"," Three ninety eight."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5478560","5479560"," Three ninety eight."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5480560","5481560"," Maybe three ninety seven."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5484560","5486560"," Three ninety eight, three ninety seven."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5486560","5487560"," Somewhere in there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5487560","5489560"," If you can get them for like ten to twenty cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5491560","5492560"," That's what I'm thinking."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5494560","5495560"," Just on volatility."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5501560","5502560"," Call it insurance."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5504560","5505560"," And if they're like bleeding."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5506560","5507560"," Just hold them."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5508560","5509560"," Hold them, hold them, hold them until like one thirty."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5511560","5512560"," Two o'clock."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5512560","5514560"," Hold them, hold them to the fucking event."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5515560","5517560"," And have a set sell on them too."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5517560","5519560"," I wouldn't be like, yeah, I'm on them."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5519560","5521560"," I'd be like, I'd put it depending on the price you get."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5522560","5523560"," I'd say you buy them at ten cents or twenty cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5523560","5525560"," It's about twenty cents and they bleed out ten cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5526560","5528560"," Put a sell on them for like thirty or forty."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5529560","5530560"," Depending upon where they are."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5530560","5531560"," If they have bled or not."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5531560","5535560"," If they've bled down a ten cents, put a sell on them for, you know, thirty cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5535560","5539560"," If they haven't bled out, then put a sell on them for forty cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5541560","5545560"," And we'll keep an eye on the put side here and see if the bears load up on them at any point."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5546560","5548560"," So I'm going to keep my eyes on three ninety eight."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5548560","5549560"," See if they keep their value."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5550560","5552560"," They're still at eighteen cents right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5552560","5553560"," They're not losing their value."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5554560","5556560"," So I'm going to keep an eye on three ninety eight P."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5557560","5560560"," And if they hold their value as we trade."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5561560","5563560"," I'll end up, I'll buy some with you guys."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5565560","5566560"," Okay."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5566560","5568560"," There's our yellow line right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5569560","5571560"," I'll make it a thicker line so you guys can see it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5573560","5574560"," On stream."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5576560","5577560"," That helps."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5577560","5578560"," That helps."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5584560","5585560"," And I'll show you."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5586560","5587560"," I'll show you book map again."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5587560","5589560"," Look at the bottom right hand side of book map."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5591560","5594560"," You can see that the buyers are in control right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5594560","5597560"," We have nine thousand more buyers than sellers on the spy."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5597560","5598560"," Let me stretch my."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5600560","5601560"," The shoulders."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5602560","5604560"," More buyers and sellers on."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5605560","5607560"," Look at my fucking cameras off."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5607560","5609560"," I think I have a camera set to take pictures."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5610560","5611560"," And not video."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5611560","5612560"," That's what I think."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5614560","5616560"," Sorry about that on the stream today."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5619560","5621560"," And I'm probably going to."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5621560","5622560"," See that right there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5622560","5623560"," It's not much better."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5623560","5625560"," Look, I'm probably going to enter some logs here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5625560","5632560"," See, four, oh, four of fours."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5635560","5636560"," Thirty three cents for."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5636560","5637560"," I'm going to do four."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5637560","5639560"," I'm going to switch to four of threes now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5641560","5642560"," I don't want to do a fly."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5643560","5645560"," I just want to buy some fucking calls."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5656560","5659560"," I've got a four or three C's."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5659560","5661560"," Sixty six cents by in."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5663560","5665560"," I want you guys to see the mainstream right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5667560","5669560"," I'm a little late to buying those."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5669560","5673560"," I should I should have bottomed down here where my cursor is, but I was blabbing."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5674560","5676560"," So that's not the best entry."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5676560","5680560"," If you're looking for an entry in here, it's probably better to wait."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5680560","5683560"," If you want to know better entry, it's probably better to wait for this fee."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5684560","5688560"," Here or at least buy down here somewhere in here is where the buy is."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5688560","5689560"," I bought right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5690560","5694560"," So what I'll do is I'll if we come down here, I'll add to my position."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5694560","5696560"," I'll just dollar cost average it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5699560","5700560"," The calls are not sixty five cents."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5700560","5702560"," They were sixty three just a moment ago."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5706560","5707560"," I wonder if I should put some stops."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5707560","5709560"," I'm not putting any stops on them just yet."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5710560","5711560"," Because I'll add to my position."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5711560","5712560"," I'm still adding my position."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5713560","5716560"," Well, I'll cut my calls loose if we break below."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5718560","5720560"," We start breaking below this VWAP."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5720560","5721560"," I'll get out of them."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5721560","5723560"," But I'm taking on some risk here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5725560","5727560"," I'm willing to I'm willing to buy some more down here if I have to."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5736560","5738560"," This setup looked the same to you guys as yesterday, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","5739560","5742560"," If you guys want what I'll do right is I'll close my position."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5743560","5745560"," I'll leave for fifteen minutes."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5746560","5748560"," I'll come back and I'll see this happen."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5749560","5751560"," This is what happens every day, like real today."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5751560","5756560"," I'll be sitting here and I'll be like, we'll dip down and I'll be like, I'm not sitting here and waiting."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5757560","5760560"," And then I come back and I'm like, I'm coming back in fifteen minutes and this happens."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5761560","5771560"," I'm like, and then, of course, everyone in the chats like we need you to leave every afternoon right around this time cap so that we can make our money."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5775560","5776560"," Because you're impatient."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5779560","5781560"," It's so true, isn't it?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","5781560","5789560"," Well, so on that options chain, like, do I think there's no chance of three nine six or three nine seven."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5789560","5791560"," It's not that I don't think there's a chance."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5791560","5793560"," I think that the dealers won't pay it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5793560","5796560"," That's my problem with it is it's not that we can't go there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5796560","5798560"," It's that the dealers don't want to fucking pay it."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5798560","5800560"," So like, if you buying them in a penny, sometimes they will."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5800560","5807560"," If enough volume comes in, enough buyers come in to the market, but in these low volume days, low trade and days."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5808560","5810560"," So, all right, so we explain it better."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5810560","5816560"," So on a big day with with market participants, it's easy to buy and weigh out OTM call."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5817560","5821560"," And see them go to like five thousand percent, three thousand percent."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5824560","5829560"," On a daily on zero dates, but on a day like saying on this one on this Wednesday."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5830560","5832560"," Low low participation in the market."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5833560","5834560"," Typically it doesn't happen."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5834560","5835560"," You want to be buying."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5837560","5839560"," Where other people are interested."

"bouA1ktZW_A","5960560","5962560"," Hold on here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","5964560","5965560"," Maybe it's off now."

"bouA1ktZW_A","6043560","6045560"," Mike Barrie's favorite stock one point."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6051560","6053560"," Looks like bullish consolidation."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6054560","6055560"," I'm BBY."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6060560","6061560"," It's tough here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6064560","6066560"," I've got demand down below here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6066560","6067560"," My cursor is."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6071560","6073560"," There is some demand right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6075560","6077560"," There's demand right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6080560","6083560"," I'd give it at least if it rolls."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6085560","6086560"," Hold on."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6086560","6087560"," Let's look in previous."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6087560","6093560"," As further action is likely to be required to ensure inflation will return sustainably to the 2% target."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6095560","6097560"," Let's see what happens on this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6097560","6098560"," Yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6098560","6099560"," So just a break below."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6099560","6104560"," Bank of England's pills is the Bank of England must keep financial stability and monetary policy distinct."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6105560","6110560"," If you're looking for a dip buy on BBY, it would be at this pivot line."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6111560","6116560"," If you're already long in BBY, I don't think it's done going up."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6116560","6119560"," And textually, it's bullish air still, believe it or not."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6121560","6127560"," If you're looking to enter BBY, I would be looking at 7863 somewhere in here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6129560","6130560"," Let's have you looking for."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6133560","6137560"," Maybe 7063 would be my buy-in."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6138560","6143560"," Bank rate, two levels priced in by the market ahead of the November monetary policy report."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6143560","6148560"," Even if it rolls, the only thing I would tell you about this would be that it's."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6150560","6151560"," BBY tends to trade."

"bouA1ktZW_A","6157560","6158560"," Oh, yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6158560","6159560"," Look at that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6159560","6161560"," Offering balances to decline."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6161560","6162560"," Look at that Tesla."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6163560","6164560"," Oh, yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6164560","6165560"," Look at that Tesla."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6167560","6168560"," Oh, yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6168560","6169560"," Look at that Tesla."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6173560","6174560"," Oh, yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6174560","6175560"," Look at that Tesla."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6179560","6182560"," Earlier we were talking about, look at this move."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6182560","6188560"," The Germany's economy minister, Habek, is said to be speaking at the Z economic summit."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6189560","6190560"," And mute this for a minute."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6190560","6193560"," So if you're a Tesla trader, if you're a trader, I'll show you this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6194560","6195560"," Close the gap."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6195560","6196560"," Consolidation move higher."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6196560","6200560"," Ricochet off the, we know we have known cell orders here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6200560","6204560"," Always broke above those known cell orders, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6205560","6208560"," So this now becomes support down here, 180."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6210560","6211560"," Right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6212560","6215560"," So you may be looking for some consolidation down here for each leg up."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6215560","6221560"," So what are you looking for if you're a Tesla trader, you're looking for, you know, consolidation, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6221560","6222560"," We had a little bit limit."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6224560","6226560"," We had some consolidation here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6226560","6227560"," Boom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6227560","6228560"," Right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6228560","6229560"," A little bit of consolidation here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6229560","6230560"," Boom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6230560","6231560"," Wait a minute."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6233560","6234560"," This is all positive."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6235560","6236560"," Boom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6236560","6237560"," Right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6237560","6238560"," And you're looking for price targets above."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6238560","6241560"," And we already know we're 50% retracement is."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6243560","6246560"," So we know it's going to make an attempt to get up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6247560","6248560"," We know that they're big."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6249560","6253560"," Or we know that there are where they're defined preset cell orders of 185."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6254560","6256560"," So we're going to be looking for a move."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6260560","6261560"," To the 50%."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6261560","6262560"," This is half back, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6263560","6267560"," You guys know when you have a, when you're in a downward trend, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6269560","6271560"," So we'd expect this at least."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6273560","6275560"," Minimum, we're going to expect this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6276560","6277560"," Sometimes it'll pop up and over."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6277560","6279560"," What you'll see is, let me show you a large timeframe."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6280560","6281560"," Another thing to expect."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6283560","6284560"," Five days."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6284560","6286560"," What you would see would be something like this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6286560","6287560"," Sometimes."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6292560","6294560"," You would see the move to 50%."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6294560","6295560"," Right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6297560","6298560"," Bounds."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6298560","6301560"," So big bounce over could be a couple of days could be like a bounce like this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6302560","6303560"," Consolidation move."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6303560","6306560"," Tag higher to 61% down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6306560","6309560"," And then continuation down for Tesla."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6310560","6311560"," This is what it would typically look like."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6311560","6312560"," Something like this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6315560","6318560"," You tag the six, the 61% for, for the continuation move down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6319560","6322560"," So if you, if you're in a down trend, you're going to have 100% move."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6323560","6326560"," 50% move, 100% move, 50% move, 100% move."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6327560","6331560"," Inside of these peaks, they sometimes give a quick bump up at 61%."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6333560","6335560"," And then you get that continuation down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6335560","6336560"," And that's what I'm showing you here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6336560","6341560"," So if we're, if we're still bearish on Tesla, which I am, we broke through."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6341560","6343560"," We broke through down below here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6343560","6344560"," So just be aware of that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6344560","6345560"," Right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6345560","6349560"," So if you want to know, are we still bearish on Tesla or, or super bullish on Tesla?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6349560","6351560"," The answer is no, we're not bullish on Tesla."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6352560","6355560"," Because we tagged new low here and new low here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6357560","6361560"," So this is the algo, algo is telling you that we're, we looked below, we were able to break below."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6361560","6362560"," We should keep going down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6363560","6365560"," So, right."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6365560","6366560"," So we're going to come up here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6367560","6369560"," Should look something like this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6370560","6373560"," And then continue, a continuation down to 134."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6375560","6377560"," 150, maybe be the start."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6378560","6380560"," You have to measure it and see what the next move down is."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6380560","6383560"," I'm going to assume the next move down is somewhere around 130."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6383560","6384560"," I haven't measured it yet, but I will."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6384560","6388560"," As we complete this, we'll look for the next move down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6390560","6391560"," Does that help you guys out there?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6398560","6402560"," Give me a get stopped out of my, I guess stopped out of my, it's what happens."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6402560","6405560"," I get stopped out of my fucking calls and then I go and look around the market."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6405560","6407560"," And I'm like, shit, should have stayed in."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6411560","6412560"," Whatever."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6414560","6415560"," That's what it is."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6420560","6421560"," It's part of streaming."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6425560","6427560"," I want to come back."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6427560","6431560"," It looks like we've got sellers that are trying to."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6432560","6435560"," Form some kind of a defense on 404."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6436560","6437560"," Excuse me."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6437560","6438560"," Yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6439560","6441560"," That's a $1.30, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6441560","6443560"," So that's a 39."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6443560","6444560"," Excuse me."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6444560","6445560"," I'm not 39."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6445560","6446560"," It's a 40."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6447560","6448560"," 40."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6448560","6449560"," 3."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6449560","6450560"," 4."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6450560","6451560"," 3."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6451560","6452560"," 4."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6452560","6453560"," 9."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6453560","6454560"," Or see, 4."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6454560","6455560"," 290."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6455560","6456560"," So let's, um."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6456560","6458560"," We're going to bring these guys down."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6458560","6459560"," 4."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6459560","6460560"," 290."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6460560","6461560"," Is that right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6461560","6462560"," Yeah."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6462560","6464560"," They're trying to, they're trying us."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6464560","6465560"," This is a price."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6465560","6467560"," This is your new price target right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6468560","6472560"," So if you, if you stayed long while I'm fucking around in the market,"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6472560","6474560"," that's your price target again."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6476560","6480560"," That's that, that's that red bar that, oh, you guys can't see this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6480560","6481560"," Let me switch over."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6484560","6486560"," So see my cursor right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6487560","6489560"," Your price target above is right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6492560","6494560"," 40290."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6495560","6497560"," That's the current price target."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6500560","6507560"," There is, uh, the next level above here where my cursor is up here is, uh,"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6507560","6508560"," 40550."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6508560","6512560"," I think translates to 404."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6514560","6515560"," 50."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6515560","6516560"," 40410."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6518560","6519560"," I think."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6525560","6526560"," Right there."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6530560","6532560"," So update your charts."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6532560","6537560"," Uh, magnet to, we've got a magnet to right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6537560","6539560"," We have another magnet to right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6539560","6543560"," Uh, be aware of this because there's also, um."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6543560","6550560"," There's also R2 that's sitting right here at 40327."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6551560","6556560"," That's just, just update your charts for this stuff up here where real sellers are with the,"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6556560","6558560"," what the real dome is telling you."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6558560","6559560"," Dom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6559560","6560560"," Dom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6560560","6561560"," Dom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6561560","6562560"," Dom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6562560","6564560"," Um, so somewhere, somewhere up in here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6566560","6567560"," The D.O.M."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6568560","6569560"," Dom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6569560","6570560"," Dom."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6570560","6573560"," Um, just be able to be conscious of all these kind of places above."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6581560","6584560"," Yeah, we can actually move that yellow line down too, couldn't we?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6584560","6585560"," Right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6593560","6595560"," Maybe that helps better."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6595560","6599560"," There's this light resistance and there's the big resistance above."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6602560","6606560"," You should be long here or I shouldn't say that, not financial advice."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6611560","6616560"," You just got two, three, seven, three, ninety sevens for 10 cents right on a town."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6619560","6622560"," Yeah, I haven't, we haven't taken a trip around yet."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6622560","6623560"," We can take a trip around."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6624560","6625560"," You guys want to take a trip around the market?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6625560","6629560"," You guys want to look at some, uh, Dixie and some, some VIX?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6631560","6633560"," I haven't looked at the VIX yet for a minute either."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6633560","6635560"," VIX is only at $21."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6635560","6636560"," We could get the VIX down to 20."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6636560","6637560"," No problem, couldn't we?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6640560","6642560"," Get the VIX down to 20 bucks flat."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6649560","6651560"," Tesla is still cranking."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6654560","6656560"," We're now going to, we should switch these to white."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6656560","6658560"," You're going to actually, I'll put this one."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6658560","6661560"," I'm going to make this one white right here or yellow right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6662560","6664560"," We're doing the same shit, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6664560","6665560"," Change this back to white."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6665560","6668560"," I don't like doing different, uh, different stuff inconsistent."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6675560","6677560"," It's a nice move right there, right?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6677560","6678560"," It's a gorgeous move."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6678560","6680560"," Look at that move right there."

"bouA1ktZW_A","6693560","6697560"," Uh, I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6697560","6699560"," There's some profit taken on this right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6699560","6700560"," This makes sense."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6700560","6701560"," Some profit taken."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6701560","6703560"," Remember, you got your 180 right here."

"bouA1ktZW_A","6722560","6723560"," What did I say?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6723560","6724560"," You should be long here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6724560","6725560"," Not financial advice."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6728560","6729560"," You should be long here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6729560","6731560"," Not financial advice."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6738560","6739560"," This is help, Eric."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6740560","6742560"," It's relentless buying right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6742560","6743560"," That is very true."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6743560","6747560"," If you look in the bottom right hand side of the book map, I mean, it's stupid."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6747560","6749560"," The buyers."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6749560","6750560"," Stupid."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6750560","6752560"," How many buyers we have?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6752560","6758560"," Stupid."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6770560","6771560"," How's Twitter going today?"

"bouA1ktZW_A","6772560","6773560"," See what's going on in Twitter right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6794560","6796560"," What did I say to somebody?"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6796560","6797560"," I said, have fun staying poor."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6797560","6798560"," I never do that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6799560","6800560"," I never do that."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6800560","6801560"," Have fun staying poor."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6804560","6805560"," And I did it to somebody."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6805560","6806560"," I was being a douche."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6806560","6807560"," I shouldn't have been."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6809560","6810560"," Oh, they deleted their comments."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6810560","6812560"," Hilarious."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6814560","6816560"," They deleted their comments."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6816560","6819560"," I did this whole thing where I said, um."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6821560","6822560"," Hold on here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6827560","6828560"," They deleted their comments."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6829560","6831560"," I always love when people delete their comments."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6831560","6837560"," People come in and we've come into my posts and they start fucking ripping on me."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6837560","6841560"," And then, of course, we fucking go to the moon or we roll over."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6841560","6842560"," It doesn't matter."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6844560","6846560"," And they fucking delete their comments."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6846560","6847560"," Hilarious."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6849560","6851560"," I love when they delete their comments."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6852560","6857560"," And it's funny because I've got the original posts inside my fucking notifications."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6857560","6858560"," Not like they go away."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6858560","6860560"," I don't ever go back and repost them, though."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6860560","6864560"," I don't want to be a fucking dickhead, but I was, I was kind of being snide."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6864560","6868560"," I don't normally do like to have fun staying poor ship, but I just thought it was hilarious."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6868560","6870560"," Because the guy was so cranky and pissy."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6870560","6872560"," So I was trying to be a douche."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6872560","6874560"," Oh, he was a birdie being a douche."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6874560","6877560"," So I was like, I have a lot of douche, but, you know,"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6877560","6879560"," he was just in a rage mood."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6879560","6881560"," I don't dislike the guy or anything either."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6882560","6888560"," I just, I was trying to be a douche back and be like, you know, that, that they still have the facial recognition thing on here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6888560","6890560"," I'll have that off next stream."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6890560","6894560"," But the, you know, when you, you know, you're like, someone's already upset."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6894560","6901560"," So you're like, you say something to them, like, um, sometimes I'll make a comment, like, uh,"
"bouA1ktZW_A","6901560","6907560"," like I'll give a bunch of facts and then say this is all based on nothing on a hunch."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6907560","6909560"," You know, just a fuck of people."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6910560","6912560"," So I was, I did the have fun staying poor."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6912560","6913560"," I don't know."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6913560","6914560"," Sorry."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6914560","6915560"," I'm fucking laughing at myself."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6915560","6918560"," Being an asshole shouldn't be an asshole."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6918560","6922560"," I got my phone's blowing up right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6922560","6925560"," Let's take a look around the market."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6925560","6928560"," Well, we have some, I want you to see on book map right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6928560","6931560"," We have some very light volume right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6931560","6934560"," This might be a rollover."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6934560","6937560"," So I want you to pay attention right here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6937560","6939560"," You start seeing this red ball coming in."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6939560","6941560"," We haven't had any red balls."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6941560","6943560"," Pretty light trading in here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6943560","6947560"," Uh, we've got some, this red line is showing up right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6947560","6949560"," Uh, this is where they're going to sell off here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6949560","6951560"," We're going to squeeze higher."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6951560","6956560"," Uh, we still have more buyers than sellers currently right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6956560","6961560"," Uh, so I'm not overly afraid that we're going to, that we're going to red bar to hell."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6961560","6964560"," If they do rug pull it, it would be nasty."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6965560","6966560"," Um."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6969560","6970560"," I'm flat right now."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6970560","6971560"," I'm not in anything."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6971560","6973560"," Uh, I'd like to be."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6983560","6986560"," Uh, somehow I got disconnected from, uh, the news stream."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6986560","6989560"," You might have missed, I might have missed some news."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6990560","6992560"," Let's take a look at."
"bouA1ktZW_A","6992560","6993560"," BbY."

"bouA1ktZW_A","7012560","7016560"," Met with heavy selling."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7016560","7020600"," This is starting to look like some distribution."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7021920","7027860"," This was looking bullish earlier, but I don't like this."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7027860","7029960"," This is looking like distribution."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7034360","7037080"," So I don't like these triple tops."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7037420","7040120"," You really want to see a move higher on BBY here."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7043160","7044600"," You really want to see like."
"bouA1ktZW_A","7046600","7047520"," I don't like this at all."
