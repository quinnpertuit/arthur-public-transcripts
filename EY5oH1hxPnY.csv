"39750","42290"," Alright, I think you guys can hear me."
"43410","45190"," Hey, Phil, if you're first right on."
"45770","46850"," Ben, how are you?"
"47010","50270"," Drew, Joey, Adam, Scott, good to see you, Jasmine. "
"52210","53130"," Good to see you all."
"55350","55930"," Hi, Omar."
"57190","59930"," I apologize for the low quality audio at the moment. "
"60270","61210"," I have a headset on."
"62150","64790"," I'm with family right now, friends."
"64790","68370"," And so it's a little too loud here. "
"68730","71870"," So I apologize right off the bat for the sound quality."
"72530","74870"," I don't have my normal condenser mic."
"79360","86200"," Frockenstein, B.O., Brad, Matt, Bo, Josh, Benjamin, Patrick, Omar, Danny, David West. "
"86600","87400"," Good to see all you guys."
"89440","90520"," You guys hear me now?"
"91740","92820"," Gerald, good afternoon."
"94540","95780"," Everybody doing well with today?"
"96960","97300"," Hey, King. "
"98980","99820"," Zio, how are you?"
"101260","102020"," Good to see you."
"102200","105060"," Joe, Mr. Brown, ACAC."
"106140","106700"," Right on. "
"107020","113160"," It might sound a little weird because it's the kind of headset that I don't know."
"114340","116300"," Someone need to speak to it, Amazon or something."
"117540","118960"," It's an old headset for my wife. "
"121960","122760"," Meliella, how are you?"
"122980","123280"," Matthias?"
"123700","124580"," Sue, how are you?"
"125060","125280"," Carrie?"
"125620","126060"," Good to see you."
"128479","130380"," Hope everybody is well this morning or this afternoon."
"130700","132080"," We have afternoon, 12 o'clock. "
"132240","132980"," Hey, X, how are you?"
"133380","133380"," Paul?"
"134560","137200"," Jarcan, Nate, Danny, Patrick?"
"138120","138340"," Right on."
"138980","140660"," Why are there so many red bubbles but no green?"
"141060","141800"," Okay, that's a good question."
"142780","143080"," Great question. "
"143500","146440"," So just right now, let's take a look at what's happening."
"146440","155700"," Okay, so we are at a resistance point as we move up into the market."
"156640","161060"," And so what you're seeing right now is resistance. "
"161060","167220"," You're seeing sellers coming in and triggering their sellers, right?"
"167220","174040"," They may have been in at 450 and they want out at 460 and you're looking for the buyers to"
"174040","177340"," step in that want to or believe that we're going to 470."
"180520","182160"," Now, excuse me for a moment."
"183000","187340"," So down here at 455, you see this is becoming new support. "
"189020","192660"," These are where the new buyers are waiting to buy again."
"193120","198760"," So let's say you had bought at 450, you sell at 460 and then you lie and wait down here"
"198760","201720"," at 455 hoping you can take the next run up to 470."
"204400","206820"," Now 460 was hard resistance. "
"207580","209340"," Now it is not hard resistance."
"210180","213300"," We're forming a higher resistance at 462."
"213760","220740"," So the chances of us breaking through 460 and hitting a pretty decent wall at 462 are pretty good. "
"220740","230600"," So an expectation would be we top out at 462, we bounce back and find support either on 460 or"
"230600","239220"," 455 for a move up to 468, 469, 470 up in here."
"239840","246300"," Now this wall is low, but if we break above to this 462, it'll push this wall higher to 470."
"247340","252160"," You guys, I'll get that right on Adam, Gerald Patrick, Miss Brown, Matthew. "
"252420","253100"," Morning, everybody."
"253520","254380"," Morning, morning, Matthew."
"255560","262660"," So what you're looking for this here, this is showing you that there's resistance at 460 and you're"
"262660","265740"," seeing some harder resistance though higher at 462. "
"266160","269600"," This resistance above was not here at the start of today."
"269600","272240"," This began to form as the morning grew."
"273220","277340"," And this is actually a good thing because the first resistance this morning was 460. "
"278360","283460"," So seeing it go higher to 462 shows that a bid is coming into the market today."
"284400","290880"," Another thing is there were no sellers above at 470 and the fact that we now have sellers above at"
"290880","298060"," 470 shows that market participants are having some faith that we can get to 470."
"298060","306420"," So you're seeing calls, you're seeing calls being put out there for 4, what is going on outside 470"
"306420","308220"," and higher. "
"309100","312420"," If you also watch the flow this morning, the options flow there."
"313640","320760"," Today had more long data options flow than we've seen in weeks, which is a positive for the market."
"322180","323640"," So keep that in mind as well. "
"323820","330960"," When I'm showing you, when I'm showing you the flow that what is going on with some weird stuff"
"330960","331660"," going on outside."
"332760","335140"," I think there's like a tractor trailer truck or something."
"339000","343760"," So 460, you can see that we're still moving up right here. "
"343860","344600"," Let me show you something else."
"344600","346020"," Just so you can see."
"346600","353200"," So right now you can see that we are short buyers in long sellers, right?"
"353340","356360"," So we have more sellers and we have buyers. "
"357000","359860"," And that should be expected where we are at 460."
"361380","365280"," You want to see or you're expecting to see more sellers at this point."
"366320","369740"," But you can also see down here that supply is not running out. "
"369740","375000"," When you look at these peaks here, this is showing you where people want to buy."
"376240","378580"," And there's a big fight going on right now at 460."
"380000","388720"," Now, if we break through this 460 level at 460.9, 460.72, if we break up to this 462"
"388720","392000"," and we eat through these sellers at 462. "
"393160","396920"," It will squeeze or, I mean, it's really not a squeeze."
"397220","398660"," It's, you know, it's by 90 of you."
"398740","403460"," I'm trying to squeeze these large liquid products. "
"403900","404620"," They're tough."
"404980","410800"," But when these things happen, right, you at 462, it will take, they're not tightly of a kind of"
"410800","412000"," squeeze up to this 470."
"412860","420140"," If we break through 462 and we're at an important moment or juncture in the market right now. "
"420140","423880"," I think somebody's doing some construction next door."
"424660","425320"," You guys hear that?"
"427480","430240"," I feel like the various resident stage front back."
"430440","431080"," Yeah, it is definitely. "
"431340","432000"," Thumbs up folks."
"432200","433100"," Thanks Phillip for saying that."
"433740","434420"," Hey, Joey. "
"435840","436280"," Good to see you."
"437260","438140"," Yeah, exactly."
"438440","441100"," Joe knows if we hit 462 and burned through these sellers. "
"441620","448580"," And the other thing too here is we've been burning through sellers for the past three trading"
"448580","448980"," sessions."
"448980","453600"," This began back on Thursday, Friday end of day."
"454020","455840"," I think it began around two in the afternoon. "
"456760","457760"," Let in to close."
"458460","464340"," And of course you saw what took place Sunday into Monday in an illiquid market in the overnight."
"465120","469860"," But now that we're in the cash market, we're really starting to see the destruction of sellers,"
"470240","470260"," right?"
"470380","474580"," You're starting to see them becoming weaker and weaker as the days move forward. "
"476340","480020"," So we're at 460.80 at this point."
"480300","482320"," If we hit this force 4620."
"483420","487660"," We could rest above here at this point to let's say a breakthrough for 6200. "
"488980","495740"," When you do a lot of this work to get to this point, it can result in a consolidation moment"
"495740","497900"," for the market to be conscious of that."
"498540","501240"," My if I were you if I were long, I would take this long."
"501460","502420"," I'm long right now. "
"503600","509580"," So if I take this long to 462, I would hope for a tag or a breakthrough and then a"
"509580","510600"," consolidation period."
"511059","513360"," So you could probably close your calls after 462."
"513919","514740"," Let it consolidate. "
"515760","517539"," Back down to 460 or 455."
"518659","520419"," And then you take another long to 470."
"521000","521840"," Unless we have some. "
"522500","523880"," I mean the news right now."
"524200","532400"," I don't know what to tell you guys about the news out there right now."
"534120","537440"," I'm beside myself because there's no news out there right now. "
"537560","539580"," They're just making it up as they go along."
"540220","540640"," It's bizarre."
"543260","547960"," Yeah, no, I've got a guy next door that was doing some construction on his yard. "
"548520","551580"," And I think he's out there with a bulldozer or something."
"551800","552400"," I have to go check."
"553240","554360"," I don't know what they're doing. "
"560220","564240"," Yeah, so if you want to enter long dated calls, we do it on the 31st."
"564440","564720"," Thanks, Cap."
"564880","565520"," That's great question. "
"565720","570580"," So the best time to be entering calls, of course, is when there's no interest."
"571660","575480"," So on the lows, like, so right now we're battling at a high right now."
"575920","580040"," If you want to buy a long dated call, you want to wait for a moment in the market where"
"580040","582100"," there is not a lot of interest. "
"582100","588780"," So if we bounce off for 60 here or 462 and let's at any point, if we bounce down today"
"588780","596980"," and start to base somewhere in that inside of that consolidation, start watching the option that"
"596980","599680"," you're looking for and start thinking to yourself."
"599840","600980"," Is that expensive right now?"
"601020","602580"," Is there interest in this right now?"
"603360","607540"," And let's say I'm like, let's say I'm like, I think we're going to 470."
"608520","610640"," So first I talk about price to myself. "
"611440","612620"," I say, okay, we're going to 470."
"614360","616960"," Then I think to myself, well, when are we going to 470?"
"620900","627000"," Now, if you're like, okay, we're going to 470, but I think it's going to hit 470 by January 31st."
"628120","629900"," You want to consider a couple things. "
"631080","638720"," You want to consider putting some extra time on that 470 so that someone else wants to buy it."
"640000","644020"," So if you think from now, let's say your date is December 31st."
"645560","650760"," The safe thing to do is to put the call out for January 14th in and around there a couple"
"650760","655440"," of weeks on it at a minimum, and that gives you the time for us to go to 470. "
"655440","665060"," It also gives you the time for you to sell that call to someone else on the"
"665060","666380"," 31st at 470."
"668940","672760"," And it gives you a little bit of leeway for pullbacks."
"673360","677440"," Now, on top of that extra two weeks, let's say we're targeting 31st. "
"678060","681700"," A lot of other people will say, well, no, what I'm going to do is I'm going to add another"
"681700","683560"," two weeks because I can't time ship."
"684000","686640"," So then you're adding it to January 31st."
"687360","693160"," And then if you add another two weeks to that for a down of severe down day, you add another"
"693160","693540"," two weeks. "
"693560","699460"," Let's call it February 14th for a price target of 470 on the 31st of December."
"701100","701540"," Right?"
"701540","705560"," And you would wait to buy that 470 call until we dip."
"705900","707820"," So right now we're at a resistance. "
"708320","709160"," I would be looking."
"709600","713700"," You can miss this, of course, we can blaze up to 470 today or Friday."
"714260","717400"," You know, but I'm saying to you that your target is a certain date. "
"717600","718800"," Add a week or two onto it."
"719080","722180"," Add another week or two onto it to account for dips in the market."
"723160","728540"," And then you want to wait and hopefully you get a chance to buy at a lower number. "
"729120","735000"," This comes into when things are burning, when the market's burning, you want to put your blinders"
"735000","742140"," on or even if we were at 470 today, I would be telling you to take a bearish position, right,"
"742240","744560"," or at least hedge at 470."
"745880","752220"," And when we were down at 450 this morning, I don't know if we opened at 450 or what I"
"752220","753560"," think we'll be close to this number."
"753560","757080"," And then we dropped to 456 or 457. "
"757480","763780"," I can't recall at the moment, but when we're on the lows, you want to be thinking about hedging the"
"763780","764960"," other way with calls, right?"
"765540","769840"," I posted this morning about buying for 70s for Friday for eight cents."
"770080","775420"," I think they went down to six or seven cents at one point this morning, maybe even cheaper, but"
"775420","783020"," start thinking those likes start thinking about hedging longs and your bottoms, hedging short when"
"783020","787780"," we're on tops at a minimum, you should be doing that, if not taking those positions."
"788800","795980"," This is the moment right here where if you were a bear, you could take probably a 455 put that's"
"795980","799240"," dated for a day from now from here to 462. "
"799920","802320"," It'll probably print for a little bit today at minimum."
"802640","805860"," I mean, at some point today or tomorrow, there's a high probability will print."
"807400","811660"," You know, so if you're a bear at this moment, that's what that's what you should be looking for. "
"811980","814780"," Hey, hopefully we get to 462 so I can grab a put."
"815420","820540"," That's a date that's dated for a day and hopefully pull back or settle hair or consolidate here."
"820760","827880"," If you're a bit bold, you should be considering cutting your lungs here to 462 and then retaking a"
"827880","830740"," new long position once a bank gets you over this hump. "
"830740","835440"," Because you can see right now, these are all banks working towards selling the market and buying"
"835440","835980"," the market."
"836320","839040"," This isn't retail doing this stuff right now."
"839800","842560"," And this stuff grinds options. "
"843560","848520"," So, you know, you made your move this morning, you get up here, you take your profits, and you"
"848520","851740"," start to think about where you are and what's the best positioning."
"851740","861460"," The best positioning for new trade at this moment is probably looking for a put down from 462 and"
"861460","867180"," then cut it loose at 456, maybe at 456."
"867640","875260"," So, I would be looking for 462 by, I think right now it's a single day, it's not zero day,"
"875340","878020"," but it's a one day put to 456. "
"878020","886300"," And you're looking for some form of either a pullback or a consolidation and that put has a high"
"886300","887440"," chance of printing."
"887920","894460"," Now, if you were going to buy a 470 call right now at this moment between 460 and 462, there's"
"894460","896480"," high interest now in that call, right?"
"896740","898160"," We saw those 470s earlier."
"898960","905680"," They were worth 7, 6, 7, 8 cents and they're going to grow if we break through 462 and they're"
"905680","907180"," probably more valuable right now. "
"907180","911720"," They're probably, I'm not looking at them right now, but I bet they're up at 14, 12 to 14 cents"
"911720","913820"," somewhere in there or where we were swinging up here."
"914640","919720"," So, if you want to be buying those calls at 10 cents or 12 cents, you want to be watching"
"919720","924400"," that option chain and thinking to yourself, hey, when can I get that cheap?"
"925380","932980"," If you're looking for that December 31st, 470 call, you should be watching that call for a day or"
"932980","933160"," two."
"933160","937660"," Like, just pop in on it, see where it's at, hey, it's at $1 or $2. "
"938220","941700"," I'm just using an arbitrary number."
"941860","946840"," Let's say it was $1 and we're up in the market right now."
"947140","951780"," Think to yourself, is there going to be a demo between now and 31st where I can catch that call"
"951780","953580"," for 50 cents instead of $1. "
"954380","955880"," Think cheaply when you're buying this stuff."
"959810","966570"," I don't pay, I don't, I think I gave up using the RSI indicator in my first year of trading."
"967530","969210"," Never ever again will I use an RSI. "
"970010","974410"," I've seen RSI's get beaten down, held up for days, weeks."
"975330","980070"," Whenever you're in a market where you do meltups, what does an RSI indicator work on a meltup?"
"981450","981930"," Never."
"984050","984750"," Never does. "
"985990","986850"," Never holds up."
"988470","991870"," Now you can use, sometimes I'll use a, let me show you a pair."
"996950","999830"," Sometimes, let's see, sometimes I'll use a VWAP. "
"1001510","1005730"," VWAP does it fairly, does that click on there now?"
"1006050","1007270"," Let's see if I can get the VWAP on here."
"1007670","1008690"," It's not really shown at the moment."
"1013320","1016240"," I don't know if I can get VWAP on this, on this heat map. "
"1017120","1023260"," But I have a VWAP indicator that I use on a book map for the futures contracts."
"1024780","1028940"," I use VWAP sometimes as an indicator, but no, I honestly don't like."
"1029260","1034359"," Yeah, Paul, you know, the RSI, you know, Paul, I'll be honest with you. "
"1036180","1041040"," I mostly, I trade support and resistances."
"1042640","1046560"," I'll look for very cheap calls or very cheap puts."
"1047319","1048720"," Those two things that I trade. "
"1049700","1051560"," So I start with spreads."
"1053060","1058740"," So I do have some early videos where I talk about how I enter my trades."
"1059480","1062680"," I start by taking on limited risk with spreads. "
"1063840","1065300"," I dated one to three months out."
"1065300","1070020"," Then I get more aggressive with monthly call or put contracts."
"1070980","1072000"," They're just naked. "
"1073180","1080900"," And then as we get deeper and longer, right down or further down in the market and the more time"
"1080900","1081820"," we spend down there."
"1082620","1087420"," I'll get more aggressive with my day trading and FD buying."
"1089000","1092120"," Zero day, one day, three day calls, weekly calls or puts. "
"1094360","1096440"," And I'm an awful trader at sometimes too."
"1096600","1098440"," If we do meltups, I'm not a good trader."
"1098960","1100700"," I don't do well with meltups. "
"1101600","1104780"," In the market because I like to trade support and resistance."
"1105480","1107300"," Once we break out of normal bounds."
"1109080","1115380"," I don't feel safety in taking on that heavy risk with with FDS and with. "
"1116500","1120240"," One one day, three day, five day calls and puts."
"1120660","1126660"," But right now, like as an example right now for today, we knew that 460 was the ceiling."
"1127320","1134420"," We knew, I think I posted this morning that you might get down to the cash close in the previous"
"1134420","1134760"," day. "
"1135500","1139120"," You know, if you break through that, the previous day is cash gap."
"1139140","1143860"," If you break through that, then you're looking for the swing low from the prior day or the prior"
"1143860","1144680"," two days before."
"1145380","1148440"," It's depending on how many days you are in the week, you go all the way back to the first"
"1148440","1150660"," day of the week to the previous swing low. "
"1151400","1158260"," So I look for support in those areas and I'm also watching book map for liquidity on the south side"
"1158260","1158900"," and the by side."
"1159560","1164320"," You can see right here that we have buyers down below at four five five zero."
"1165420","1170060"," You can see even below down here at this white line, this ice that's down here. "
"1170580","1173080"," These are some big buyers down here at four fifty."
"1173740","1176160"," These are the people that are selling right now."
"1176680","1179480"," And you had buyers that already bought it at four fifty five. "
"1179740","1181000"," This was earlier this morning, right?"
"1181360","1186960"," They want to see it go to four sixty two minimum, if not four seventy four sixty nine four seventy"
"1186960","1187340"," or so."
"1188960","1196460"," And so we're looking now to see if we saw our entire out these sellers and if new buyers step"
"1196460","1197060"," into the market."
"1197060","1199580"," Now we're probably in the market right now. "
"1199580","1203780"," If I had to guess what it looks like to me is that we're pinned at four sixty."
"1204260","1209660"," And what do you want to ask you guys out there because let's start to think in our minds, right?"
"1210220","1213400"," Why do you think we've been at four sixty at this moment right now?"
"1214000","1215400"," Now we're at four sixty one."
"1215920","1217200"," Why do you think we're pinning here?"
"1218780","1220280"," I give you a good answer for it. "
"1222320","1224480"," And you can see buyers stepping into right now."
"1225360","1226760"," See him see that big green ball."
"1228620","1230620"," Any guys out there know why we're pinned here?"
"1238850","1240370"," Wait to see if he has a answer. "
"1246040","1247400"," Now there's seventeen cents."
"1253380","1255520"," No, we're pinned here because we're waiting."
"1255980","1260360"," My assumption is that we're waiting on the Joe Biden speech at two thirty. "
"1264260","1266080"," There's a small call while while here."
"1267540","1270780"," But the call law was at four sixty, not at four sixty two."
"1274040","1276760"," We're probably pinned here mostly due to Biden. "
"1277580","1278000"," If I had to guess."
"1278760","1280140"," Yeah, we're burning out some premiums."
"1280780","1281440"," We're doing that too. "
"1284280","1285300"," Yep, we're at resistance."
"1286720","1288160"," Yep, we need to break the pin."
"1289020","1289460"," Absolutely. "
"1290480","1292980"," We are breaking the pin right now that it's happening."
"1293640","1296140"," More than likely we'll bounce right off four sixty two."
"1297240","1299580"," Some are somewhere there and then we'll pull back. "
"1301200","1303100"," And what happens then, right?"
"1303160","1305360"," So we've got everybody buying calls right now at this moment."
"1305720","1307200"," We'll bounce off four sixty two."
"1307480","1309620"," The broke or the dealers, the market makers. "
"1309620","1312480"," They'll skim some of the profit off the new calls that are being bought."
"1314060","1316700"," And then they'll force you to go back in and buy again."
"1317280","1321480"," So you'll be you'll be in for four sixty or four seventy or four sixty two or something. "
"1321960","1325060"," You're entering the market right now at a high price."
"1325640","1327860"," It'll pull back and it'll force you to rebuy again."
"1329640","1330260"," Eighteen cents. "
"1330480","1331000"," Now that's hilarious."
"1336690","1339290"," So, yeah, I took profit from my calls."
"1340250","1341430"," My FDs and I buy yesterday. "
"1341710","1343170"," I took profit of those running the bell."
"1344670","1345310"," But I did."
"1345530","1346530"," I have bought back in. "
"1347010","1348550"," I own a bunch of crap right now."
"1348690","1350650"," I got calls up the Ying Yang like."
"1351710","1352670"," I've got calls. "
"1353350","1357150"," I've got racks of calls right now that I haven't sold."
"1357730","1358690"," You guys hear me?"
"1358770","1359170"," Hey, Miro."
"1359470","1359890"," What up, brother?"
"1361190","1362110"," Good to see you. "
"1363870","1365190"," Yeah, Matt, I would take profit."
"1366110","1367610"," There's nothing on its profit taken."
"1367930","1370350"," We're hitting resistance Miro right now at four six two. "
"1371530","1377890"," The wall was at four sixty and we're starting to build a higher wall at four sixty two."
"1378730","1379770"," Think of post that earlier."
"1379770","1381710"," Also, Miro, for you to see. "
"1382430","1385210"," If there is a pullback, it should be to four fifty five."
"1385890","1388270"," The deepest that should go is forty five hundred."
"1389230","1392090"," But this would be the by the dip level at four five five. "
"1392390","1394950"," The by the F and dip level is four fifty."
"1395550","1399590"," Our first resistance is being torn through right now for six two."
"1400310","1402110"," It went from four sixty to four six two. "
"1404150","1408970"," And my my thought is that we're going to hit four six two bounce back."
"1409670","1415810"," Consolidate at either four sixty, which is becoming a new support down to four five five."
"1416010","1420550"," And then we're going to make a run to four six eight four six nine four seventy. "
"1421590","1422490"," Somewhere up in here."
"1423330","1424810"," There's somewhat of a new wall."
"1424990","1428990"," If you guys can see this being built at four six six two. "
"1429210","1430330"," So this is all new right here."
"1432210","1434870"," We could we could actually squeeze the four six six."
"1436410","1438610"," It's very possible at this moment. "
"1438610","1442050"," You can see sellers are backing off to a higher number."
"1442290","1443310"," Sellers are getting scared."
"1443550","1445350"," They're saying, Oh, maybe I'll hold off to four six six. "
"1446250","1447750"," So this is all new right here."
"1447850","1448710"," This new this new."
"1450590","1452730"," Group of sellers above it four six six. "
"1453450","1455170"," It's very interesting moment right now."
"1457600","1458980"," Yeah, it's getting their captain run."
"1459320","1460200"," That wasn't there before. "
"1460460","1462040"," That's just starting to show itself."
"1462460","1464100"," That could be showing some squeeze conditions."
"1464180","1469240"," There's some panic with shorts as we get closer to four six two right here. "
"1469240","1471340"," You're going to see us hit this four six two."
"1471480","1477060"," This could trigger a short covering at four six two and that would push us to four six six."
"1478180","1482560"," If we break through four six if we get past four six two one hundred percent, we're going to we're"
"1482560","1484480"," going to trigger some short covering. "
"1485160","1485920"," Let it out."
"1488040","1492980"," Kind of while watching the stuff live right you can it gives you a better feel for where we are."
"1496410","1497770"," Where we actually are in the market. "
"1497770","1498130"," Yeah."
"1503360","1505440"," And we're at four six one point two five."
"1505740","1508040"," I mean, this is dangerous to shorts. "
"1508760","1511500"," Shorts don't want to see this four six two."
"1511860","1518070"," They don't want to see a break above four six two and we'll look and see if any buyers are"
"1518070","1518630"," stepping in."
"1520880","1522500"," Yeah, so we're still heavy on sellers. "
"1522780","1523440"," This is good too."
"1523760","1527660"," If you're a bull and you see this, you're seeing more of a grind here at this moment."
"1527960","1529240"," You're exhausting sellers. "
"1529440","1532740"," If we had bounced off four sixty hard."
"1533680","1536740"," That's a bad that's a that's that's that's bearish all day long."
"1537040","1539760"," If you're a bear and you saw hard bumps off four sixty. "
"1541260","1542980"," That means we're checking down below."
"1543160","1544700"," I made a video about that last night, right?"
"1544900","1549420"," You want to hold the calls to four sixty and check to see what the reaction is."
"1549540","1551380"," Let the banks do the work at four sixty. "
"1551920","1554020"," You know right now this is banks doing it."
"1554320","1559080"," There are banks that are long right now and there are other banks that are shorts and they're"
"1559080","1559680"," getting caught."
"1560300","1563320"," Right now in a long position. "
"1563640","1565520"," You can tell that the market's long right now."
"1566040","1568620"," This is showing you that the market is long."
"1569760","1570700"," One hundred percent. "
"1571580","1573540"," Otherwise it would have ricocheted off four sixty."
"1574320","1579940"," So you're going to see these sellers get absorbed and you might see a pullback at four six two to"
"1579940","1580740"," consolidate."
"1581440","1583800"," Or we're going to rip right straight higher to four six six. "
"1585460","1587840"," I would laugh and I'm going to be honest with all of you out there."
"1587840","1590780"," If we rip up to four six six or four seventy by Friday."
"1591440","1594380"," Those calls from this morning, I'm telling you, they're going to print heavy. "
"1596300","1598700"," They're going to print thousands of percent more than likely."
"1600440","1603320"," Eight hundred percent, five hundred percent, thousand percent."
"1604440","1605220"," You'll see it. "
"1605300","1606160"," You'll see an intro."
"1606260","1607820"," You'll see a premium and interest wash."
"1609300","1610820"," Just that's another thing too. "
"1610820","1617500"," If you're buying calls that are way outside the money that you don't that when we're at a down"
"1617500","1618560"," power point in the market."
"1619100","1620680"," I'll say you're buying those four seventies."
"1621000","1624460"," Don't be buying like four sixty nines or four sixty sevens. "
"1624780","1626960"," Think of a number that everyone's going to want to see."
"1627500","1629520"," Because it doesn't matter if it's four seventy."
"1629900","1632500"," It only matters if people think it's going to four seventy. "
"1633300","1635140"," And if they're going to buy those specific calls."
"1635880","1637440"," It doesn't ever matter if you ever get there."
"1637440","1642120"," It just matters that you buy them before everybody else and that they think it's going there. "
"1645550","1647230"," Yeah be come on Santa."
"1648190","1650090"," You guys all track it all this right now."
"1650670","1652910"," I bet there's some of you bears out there watching this. "
"1654010","1655750"," They tell me you don't follow me."
"1659030","1661670"," Did you mean to the bottom from four sixty sorry."
"1662130","1664650"," Yeah so when we were coming up this morning. "
"1666370","1667670"," Here's some clues okay."
"1668810","1670170"," Here's some clues so."
"1670930","1671730"," In the overnight. "
"1673270","1677810"," We got up to four sixty forty six hundred and we didn't ricochet off."
"1678510","1680950"," Then we did it again this morning in pre market."
"1681170","1682470"," We didn't ricochet off. "
"1683610","1686070"," When you don't see those harsh reactions."
"1686750","1690870"," And now we're in full on cash markets and we've come to four sixty."
"1690870","1697670"," We can see that the wall was at four sixty at the open it's moved up to four sixty two. "
"1698250","1701610"," And we've had our third time of hitting four sixty."
"1702270","1708330"," And when you've had your third time third opportunity to sell it down to ricochet and it hasn't"
"1708330","1708650"," happened."
"1709250","1712770"," You're now looking for us to burn right through it. "
"1713230","1716430"," But the move the move is up at this point in the market."
"1717090","1722450"," So my assumption is that we're going to we're going to destroy these sellers right here four sixty"
"1722450","1722810"," two."
"1722930","1725310"," Now it takes a lot of work to get here too. "
"1725490","1730010"," You have to remember to the amount of effort takes to break through these resistance levels."
"1730010","1731130"," It's a lot of work."
"1731570","1736450"," So I still assume even if we kill these sellers at four sixty two. "
"1736790","1740070"," That maybe we could squeeze to four sixty six today."
"1741270","1746570"," My hope is as a bold that we break four sixty two then we pull back."
"1747130","1754030"," Build some more support at between four sixty and four fifty five and make the next attempt to"
"1754030","1756270"," break through four six six four seventy. "
"1757430","1761730"," But right now it's not I mean all for all intensive purposes for."
"1762410","1766830"," What took place in the overnight what took place in pre market now what's taking place right now"
"1766830","1768810"," you're starting to add up what's happening next."
"1772560","1777020"," Let me type let me check let me let me open it up me open up my brokerage and just"
"1777020","1783160"," check and see what I got going on here. "
"1783440","1783780"," Okay."
"1785320","1786600"," Well you guys know what I'm holding."
"1789790","1790710"," Hey today. "
"1792990","1794070"," What's going on."
"1795330","1799010"," I mean I need to see my tasty trade."
"1803940","1804720"," Tight here. "
"1811610","1813670"," And I will bring out my portfolio."
"1816250","1821210"," I'm always sketched out when I'm not trading while running this stuff on a different platform."
"1822270","1824590"," Because I'm always freaked out over portfolios doing. "
"1825070","1825810"," Oh yeah I'm doing well."
"1826490","1828650"," So I've got a right now when I'm currently holding."
"1828650","1831430"," Like actually holding. "
"1831870","1833330"," I'm holding IWM."
"1836350","1837950"," What do I have here."
"1838550","1841870"," I've got IWM 1231 230 C's. "
"1842650","1843170"," I'm still holding."
"1843690","1844770"," I haven't given those up."
"1845850","1853410"," And I'm holding 12 20 or 1231 480 C's for the spy. "
"1853410","1860250"," And then I'm holding on another brokerage."
"1863570","1868890"," I'm holding a bunch of crap over here I think too."
"1880720","1882580"," Oh yeah baby. "
"1884080","1890220"," I've got 1229 478 477s."
"1892260","1893460"," Those are going to print fat."
"1896180","1898980"," I think I'm not really holding these. "
"1899180","1899720"," That's the other thing."
"1899840","1903840"," So I've got some 1229 477 478s."
"1904660","1908360"," I don't think that they print but I'm not expecting them to. "
"1908520","1913400"," I just want them to if we get to 470 trying to print like half of them."
"1913400","1914460"," It's like 50%."
"1914460","1916360"," I'm not trying to hold these to the end. "
"1916360","1920180"," And then I'm holding sorry I just burped."
"1920800","1921620"," This had lunch."
"1922160","1922360"," I apologize. "
"1922640","1922880"," Excuse me."
"1923580","1926880"," And then holding I got some nice ones ready for these."
"1928180","1932100"," I'm holding these are probably hold right to the right to the to the bitter end. "
"1932540","1936460"," I'm holding January 5 457 458."
"1937160","1939960"," Then it calls spreads a bunch of those."
"1940340","1944640"," I bought those yesterday at the rock bottom at 1043. "
"1945320","1946980"," I bought those right at the bounce."
"1947460","1948660"," There was zero interest in them."
"1949400","1951300"," That's probably my best play right now. "
"1951880","1953840"," That one's going to print me a fat check."
"1957320","1958980"," And I sold my FDS."
"1961400","1962660"," Yes, I use the VIX. "
"1963840","1964360"," Yep."
"1964720","1967060"," So if you so my training plan is this."
"1967280","1967440"," Okay. "
"1968040","1970700"," This is explain my basic training plan."
"1971560","1976160"," I use volume and market profile on thinkorswim."
"1976420","1978680"," If you guys want to script for that, let me know. "
"1979300","1985500"," I can post a script that you can just I think you can just upload it to thinkorswim."
"1985800","1988220"," Sign yourself up for a free thinkorswim account."
"1988320","1993360"," If you don't use that brokerage, you can still use it for really nice volume profile stuff. "
"1993800","1999580"," It's probably the best free way to get your volume profile market profile information."
"1999580","2001580"," So what am I doing?"
"2001580","2003660"," I'm looking at a candlestick chart, right?"
"2004560","2006140"," So I'm looking at a candlestick chart."
"2007760","2010340"," I look at volume and market profile. "
"2012380","2019320"," And I'll do basic charting stuff, basic charting stuff like wedges and support and resistance."
"2020760","2026060"," I get my support and resistance from book map is critical and key."
"2026060","2027620"," I use spot gamma. "
"2029000","2032920"," I also I don't use them as much, but I used to watch a lot of Bob Kendall."
"2034060","2036000"," And I would put those three together."
"2036360","2040560"," I would put together what I see on book map, what spot gamma is telling me. "
"2041100","2046740"," And then I go to Bob Kendall to verify whether I'm right or wrong."
"2046960","2048679"," So I'm looking at three to four sources."
"2049199","2051340"," So I'll put in my support resistance lines. "
"2052960","2053440"," Right."
"2053440","2056000"," I'll put in where the volatility levels are."
"2056580","2060260"," So I know where hard support is and where hard tops are. "
"2062540","2065260"," And that I'm looking at the market sentiment."
"2065800","2066960"," I'm looking at retail sentiment."
"2068440","2070600"," I'm looking at swing highs, swing lows. "
"2072639","2074960"," So like if you see me put something out there, see me."
"2075320","2080500"," Sometimes I used to post just like a chart with an expanding wedge on it."
"2080500","2084440"," And I would say buy this right here and people would say, well, you can't just post that and not"
"2084440","2087739"," tell me what you're doing to post just one or two lines. "
"2088380","2091960"," But it takes so long for me to get that information out to people."
"2092659","2096040"," Do all the research and then put all that stuff out there that."
"2097440","2099940"," I don't take the time to explain it all to people. "
"2099940","2101880"," If they like it, they like it if they don't, they don't."
"2104620","2109820"," Yeah, I'll get you guys volume profile scripts and market profile scripts."
"2110080","2110480"," It's both. "
"2112780","2114840"," I think it's Captain Jim James, my handle."
"2116860","2122300"," I will put I think I'm if you go to my if you just do an advanced Twitter search."
"2123440","2124480"," Look for Uber. "
"2125220","2128780"," For you go to use you use the handle captain's alpha."
"2129540","2135300"," And then as the person you're searching and then search up Uber and it shows my trading view"
"2135300","2136960"," handle."
"2137380","2138900"," You can click through to trading view. "
"2139400","2141840"," I think you guys can copy my charts there, right?"
"2144660","2148040"," Also, so I chart out all these levels on trading view."
"2148280","2150720"," I'll start publishing those two for yes."
"2151840","2153380"," RTY and and Q."
"2154040","2155200"," So you have them every day. "
"2156540","2158540"," Where these levels are and they change somewhat."
"2158780","2165640"," You can see today that our resistance was at 460 and book map is now telling us that resistance is"
"2165640","2166400"," at 462."
"2166980","2171740"," That's pretty significant to know you need to know how the market is changing in real time. "
"2173020","2176220"," It's important to know this stuff as as you are trading."
"2178520","2183120"," You can see the liquidity the buyers swooping in from the bottom here."
"2183520","2184480"," There's an ocean of buyers. "
"2187360","2188580"," Yeah, I'll get to the scripts Adam."
"2191460","2191860"," Yeah."
"2192820","2195100"," Yeah, those December 23rds are fucking rips. "
"2195100","2195780"," Sorry, I shouldn't be swearing."
"2196300","2197740"," Those December 23rds are ripping out."
"2198380","2204760"," Okay, I have to go through you know, I used to use trading view. "
"2204760","2207260"," I used to share a lot of charts on trading view."
"2208280","2209820"," I forget how to that."
"2209920","2210720"," I must be doing it wrong. "
"2211120","2215480"," I will go back in and figure out how to start sharing that stuff again with you guys."
"2216840","2218880"," So you guys can actually just rip them."
"2219620","2220740"," Keep them for yourself. "
"2224080","2225220"," I got a chubby."
"2226140","2229400"," So yeah, so you guys can see we're at some resistance here."
"2229760","2232820"," You guys can see where the buys up on your own charts. "
"2232820","2235820"," What I would just write is I would I would snap a line at 455."
"2237380","2241120"," Right, and hope and pray that you get an opportunity to buy."
"2241440","2242640"," I would snap another line at 460. "
"2243860","2247560"," Because that's going to firm up to a pretty decent support level."
"2248140","2251560"," And then my price targets right now would be 466."
"2252280","2252720"," 468. "
"2253880","2254900"," 469 or 99."
"2255240","2256420"," 468 and 470."
"2257480","2260500"," So I put you know, like minor resistance at 466. "
"2260500","2269620"," six minor resistance at 468 major resistance at 470 right you know that your supports now are 460"
"2269620","2278660"," 455 and 450 and this is live stuff so you if you meet people on on Twitter or people on"
"2278660","2286440"," YouTube and they're just winging what the support is book map shows you what it actually is it's"
"2286440","2292800"," it's a hundred percent at least for right now these are the most current levels in the market right"
"2292800","2306380"," now these are the levels that the hedge funds use these are the levels that the banks use thanks"

"2345680","2352360"," another resistance yeah so let's talk about that stuff okay is this you have you seen any book map"

"2367580","2375920"," you can so I can overlay the hero indicator on to it they've got some it's expensive like with"

"2462000","2467960"," they're so sloppy they don't they don't drill down into what is actually moving flow algo is"
"2467960","2476080"," probably the best software in terms of identifying consistently movers they do sometimes miss"
"2476080","2484960"," things sometimes sometimes trading six is like too wide of a net"
"2484960","2494560"," whereas flow algo tends to be they nail a lot of tickers not every day but consistently"

"2752630","2758770"," this is where the shorts are this is where the sellers are $32 to $33 they're just waiting for you"
"2758770","2768690"," to move this stock down okay if you're able to grind through $32 and $33 minor resistance to 40"
"2768690","2775470"," and then you've got sellers hiding above at $45 this is really what you need to know so if you're"
"2775470","2781810"," a buyer of AMC you're looking for some weakness at some point a dip let's say down to you probably"
"2781810","2790370"," have some support down to $28 now if you break through $28 you're gonna free fall down to 23 okay"
"2790370","2795370"," and you see this up here these are major sellers above these are banks the problem you know this"
"2795370","2801070"," probably is it's probably the frickin owner of the owner of AMC himself that guy owns more AMC"

"2882310","2888390"," are day trading Bitcoin today you can see your miner and you can see your miner support right your"
"2888390","2899370"," buy zone for today will be 48450 down to 48375 and you've got sellers above that 48 855 48 70"
"2899370","2908050"," 48 885 now but on a larger time frame this is really what you want to be looking at you"
"2908050","2916010"," could call this on your next time frame you've got supports at 48 200 48 400 you've got sellers at"
"2916010","2924330"," 48 900 49 100 but if you guys are looking on a much larger time frame you guys want to"
"2924330","2932190"," see what the real levels are you can see right here pretty easy to see"
"2932190","2942150"," you can see down below this is major support right now 40,000 medium support we'd say"
"2942150","2947850"," like where are you like like I'm like a you got well you I guess you call this S1 is"
"2947850","2957670"," 4500 support level one support level two is 42 500 and S3 or that would be a RTX"
"2957670","2963990"," right a buy at 40,000 so if you want to be buying if you want to go heavy on"
"2963990","2969630"," Bitcoin it's 40,000 is your level okay so if you see weakness in Bitcoin that's your level of buy"
"2969630","2976550"," you've got some resistance above it 52 500 so my assumption would be right now if you see us tag"
"2976550","2983250"," 52 500 you're gonna be a seller and wait for a bounce down below at 45 and 48 610 is"
"2983250","2990050"," becoming a level as well I should note that Bitcoin is very stable at the moment at 48 600 but"
"2990050","2996130"," you want to be a buy the dipper on Bitcoin right now 45 small position larger position at 42 5"
"2996130","3005360"," and then go heavy at 40,000 below 30,000 yeah absolutely correct when I got you I think"
"3005360","3021390"," 10 of men it's trying"
"3021390","3027710"," to compress a lot of information right now it's not having a fun time so there we go we've got"
"3027710","3036170"," not big support down there Quinn like 30,000 is okay support and it probably firm up once we start"
"3036170","3051680"," diving down here at 30 and 25,000 see if we can go a little bit lower I think that's"
"3051680","3058700"," the small scale I can get it to compute on 25,000 so the one thing you got to know"
"3058700","3065280"," down here is that these will change if you if we start to come down you'll see some of this"
"3065280","3074040"," these buyers disappear they're probably going to congregate at the 30,000 and 25,000 level and you"
"3074040","3081540"," guys need to take note of this this right here right this is realize so if you see a ripper"
"3081540","3089320"," to 70,000 there will be sellers at that excuse me at 70 that is called a hard wall above"
"3089320","3096660"," 70,000 so be aware of that you can still see or buy the dippers are right here they're even"
"3096660","3107140"," more concentrated you want an exact number it's 39, 940, 42, 2, 4, 5, 45, 0,"
"3107380","3115900"," 8, 5 and you have sellers starting at 68, 5, 90 you know I'm setting alert like if you guys"
"3115900","3121740"," trade Bitcoin you set alerts in your phone or in your favorite charting software these are your"
"3121740","3127320"," danger or these are your buy zones this is your danger zone and this is what Quinn wants to see"
"3127320","3136100"," down here at 30,000 and 25,000 yeah it should still be climbing I'll do IWM for you guys"
"3136100","3141140"," I'll do it right now I'll do malls we got to get out of this now we we made Quinn"
"3141140","3150020"," happy we made his day connections get out of this one and then DXV get we're on DXV and"

"3158380","3166760"," you know can we can we squeeze the market and that's happening right now right we're seeing it"
"3166760","3171920"," happen all across the market you're seeing it happen in airlines travel stocks we heard the"
"3171920","3178660"," bullshit that took place yesterday you got these people saying Wall Street is reacting to COVID in"
"3178660","3184160"," the airline stocks and travel stocks no that's all bullshit it was just one more day for them to"
"3184160","3188860"," pound it down to a level that they wanted to buy it at so when you're hearing the worst the"
"3188860","3193720"," worst the worst the worst news what should you be thinking you should be thinking why are they"
"3193720","3202020"," saying this news it is so that they can buy it is so that they can buy the bottom right"
"3202020","3209760"," that's why you'll be conscious of that okay we're gonna go a little bit more not as tight and"
"3209760","3218100"," so yeah it's just trading tight a tight tight range to 16 a little more yeah"
"3218100","3226630"," so these these uh so this should help you"
"3226630","3235090"," second here so we've got the same as yesterday we've got more sellers than buyers"
"3235090","3243030"," hard support right now is looking like 206 but it doesn't look like it's coming down either right"
"3243030","3248870"," we know that sell the news on IWM is 230 these are where my calls are by the way I've"

"3277310","3284390"," got sellers above it to 17 90 and to 18 30 the key to understand about IWM right now is"
"3284390","3289810"," how compressed it is right how compressed it's trading ranges right now there's this slow grat you"
"3289810","3297630"," remember we're we're taking hits on tech companies in tech that's what they're doing in IWM right"
"3297630","3303070"," now they're getting all these stocks down to a price that people want to pay you're watching some"
"3303070","3311210"," stocks in IWM right now like travel stocks squeezing today because of this because of this hedging"

"3316230","3322250"," for 2020 to you guys know what happens once these hedges burn off for the rest of the month I'll"
"3322250","3330210"," tell you it it goes way higher way like when you get into January mid-January mid- February IWM"
"3330210","3336550"," is potential to go 230 240 easy wouldn't even blink seeing that happen the more bid we get into the"
"3336550","3347330"," market right now the more chance that I'd be able to squeeze this higher about"

"3464010","3471470"," wall is at 270 you've got some minor cell zone up here into 270 but we're probably on the high"
"3471470","3476150"," side as a call holder on bill if you wanted to long bill I would say sent alert for 242"
"3476150","3483990"," no I would set to learn at 245 and then an absolute bottom rock bottom of 230 and I would"
"3483990","3493970"," hold it to 265 270 what else do I'm gonna do here I'll do tesla right now"
"3493970","3512070"," and then I'll do amazon tesla or you got tesla tesla nerds and apple nerds and let's"
"3512070","3518810"," do tesla you guys know I want to buy tesla at 750 so don't even be talking me about buying"
"3518810","3524490"," it now and there is a ton of iron on tesla right now too what I warned you guys of"
"3524490","3531430"," this that actually we have more sellers coming into the market than I've seen in some time which is"
"3531430","3536830"," interesting so some of these sellers weren't here yesterday you guys should be cautious right now"
"3536830","3543190"," with tesla yesterday there weren't many sellers with tesla you guys have to be really careful here"
"3543190","3551370"," okay you guys listening to me the polls are listening so you've got they're ready if you're a tesla"
"3551370","3561290"," if you're a tesla bull you're looking to buy at 880 average down to 870 now you should see some"
"3561290","3567410"," sort of bounce at 890 I would be a pirate 880 for us for a weekly or a daily play"
"3567410","3575790"," but dude there are sellers hiding above here at 92925 this is not good this isn't good to see"
"3575790","3584260"," let's take a look at a closer level"
"3584260","3593700"," yeah so you've got this is the one thing about tesla you guys need to know is I want to"
"3593700","3597980"," see tesla at 750 but you're not gonna see it because there's so many buyers like this stock"
"3597980","3603320"," everybody loves whether it doesn't matter if you love it or not everybody loves it this buyers"
"3603320","3611240"," always buyers down below so right here you can see it right it goes from 875 is your so your"
"3611240","3618480"," buy zone is 890 to 875 if it goes below 875 you're a seller remember that right now the current"
"3618480","3626560"," price is 914.77 but you've got sellers just above at 92925 so it looks to me like sideways and"
"3626560","3633040"," then consolidate back down to 880 for another rip up to 920 that's what I would expect out of tesla"
"3633040","3639720"," unless unless we get some liquidity in the market if the market gets liquidity or supply to sell"
"3639720","3645580"," the market you'll see us you'll see us go below 870 if we sell the market you'll see if liquidity"
"3645580","3650180"," comes into the market that will break through this 920 and 925 and you guys want to know what the"
"3650180","3655880"," levels are for that like where the sellers are higher I don't know if I can get the sellers higher"
"3655880","3665860"," today it's not really a little bit slow today but this I mean you got sellers at 950 and probably"
"3665860","3672020"," a thousand bucks above but you've got some hard resistance today unlike yesterday my assumption is"
"3672020","3677940"," everybody bought the dip down here and now they're selling for profit and you've got some bag"
"3677940","3683680"," holder class bulls coming into play you'll get back you'll be a bag holder up here at 914 it'll"
"3683680","3688720"," it'll consolidate back down 880 and then it'll force you to buy back in again you get enough of"
"3688720","3696080"," that happening and eventually you'll break through and wear out these sellers at 920 to 925 my"
"3696080","3702440"," assumption is that some of these sellers up here at 929 25 these guys bought 1200 if any of you"
"3702440","3709320"," out there are listening to me right now I told you not to buy that 1200 can I check Amazon"

"3794090","3802630"," does this help you out so you know what your supports and sells are $17 buying the dip by the"
"3802630","3808390"," dip on pound here all day long is $17 or that's here you could make that your stop loss so"
"3808390","3817410"," 17 let's tell it anything under 17 is a stop loss and anything above $25 is a sell right now"
"3817410","3826070"," let's break through it then make it sport they do snap next let me just stop"
"3826070","3835850"," I miss anybody so far"

"3846250","3854600"," let's do a snap snap brutal"
"3854600","3863900"," you've got high resist yeah this is definitely squeezable 4750 is a hedge wall that's not good"
"3863900","3873340"," hard support down at $43 at $43 looks like you've got but it's dangerous snaps dangerous like if"
"3873340","3880260"," you sell through 43 right you will free fall down to at least 40 if not deeper and you can"
"3880260","3886440"," tell right now that it's being heavily shorted you can see that it's pinned basically pinned to 45"
"3886440","3893700"," bucks and even if you got the 4750 they're gonna push down on you so if you're a snap investor"
"3893700","3900680"," you are looking for a very bullish call order flow in matter of fact you can go to the CBO"
"3900680","3906620"," CBEO CME or whatever I think it's a CBEO you can go to their site I'll post if I can"
"3906620","3912660"," if you guys can tag me on Twitter later I'll I can show you how to look for the calls"
"3912660","3919280"," and puts them when they expire on snap for the next few months and you can deduce when they will"

"3952510","3960450"," barely broke even like a lost one or lost two that I freaking made one I beat one I've been"
"3960450","3968470"," happy with this you know it's good on snap right now would be just buying the stock or buying leaps"
"3968470","3974090"," on snap until they and until that they're the hedge funds are being real pricks right now in some"
"3974090","3981030"," stocks and this is one of them and can it squeeze yes but timing it and draining the money on"
"3981030","3993390"," it squeezing that's gonna be a hard one okay so we're doing Amazon now yesterday"

"4531080","4536860"," go into a supporter resistance if it's gonna hold are we actually building a base or not it's hard"
"4536860","4542620"," to see those things with just traditional candlestick charts are we gonna start drilling to the"
"4542620","4547480"," core of the earth yesterday that was a big question for us was are we drilling here or not and"
"4548160","4553780"," we knew it looked like we were drilling at the open but then we saw the base being built so"
"4553780","4561080"," we knew we were going up I think at 1043 right at the right at the doji the exhaustion doji"

"5627410","5637010"," leaving behind a wall of a base you could call it so we're starting to flip to"
"5637010","5642770"," positive gamma I want to warn all of you bears out there right now okay we are flipping to positive"
"5642770","5649730"," gamma we were in negative gamma yesterday and we start flipping here they're gonna build this thick"

"5699850","5706130"," they'll say stock is at a hundred dollars and they are going to say well where do we want it's"
"5706130","5715810"," $80 or $120 and then think about time right you're saying I think this $100 stocks gonna be at 80"
"5716410","5724390"," think about time right how long we'll take to get to that $80 and then think about the swings that"
"5724390","5730970"," it could take the implied move over that time let's see like I think it'll be 80 bucks in three"
"5730970","5737950"," months well then think about what the implied move is with all the options out there it's implied"
"5737950","5742710"," that it'll move so much over a week or a month and then you're looking for a swing high to"
"5742710","5751030"," take it down to $80 so lots of timing lots of it's about time volatility it's about interest in"
"5751030","5761010"," options where the where's the interest in options when do they expire look at the wall at"
"5761010","5769610"," four six one now yeah we're building a wall we're building does not bode well"

"5797830","5803650"," I think they're 300 400 percent they should hit a thousand percent today no matter fact if we hit"
"5803650","5815010"," 470 those bad boys will probably print two or 3,000 percent some stupid like that they're"
"5815010","5820550"," printing heavy I know they are I know they're printing heavy and wait so you see the premium"
"5820550","5827290"," kicking on them if the premium kicks on it like if you get the thing is if anyone believes they"

"5882530","5888350"," want to see us hit 470 or 466 467 and you want you want to see us sell down maybe"
"5888350","5896390"," to 460 then make another move to 478 after Christmas you know and we could just swing this thing"
"5896390","5905210"," here's there's all there's also another thought process that's what's being caused it is that we"
"5905210","5913430"," could go to 4 straight to 478 and then swing back down even deeper like 448 or lower that the"
"5913430","5920490"," swings could get more violent so we're looking for a bid in the market into January and March to"
