"125300","126280"," Are y'all doing out there?"
"127800","131800"," I swear by the, uh, I swear by the end of the week, I'm going to be looking like a,"
"131860","140840"," uh, like a pajama trainer sitting here trading during the day."
"140840","142160"," Hedging at nighttime."
"143100","144960"," All kinds of nonsense right now. "
"145080","155460"," I don't know about any of you out there, but, uh, This past week specifically has been, uh, one"
"155460","157240"," of the harder weeks trading here."
"158660","163540"," Having to pass couple weeks, but specifically this week, last week, week before we had some Dixie"
"163540","172340"," issues, China issues, of course, or you have to watch it, right?"
"172460","173660"," You have no, you don't really have a choice."

"182960","190820"," Uh, and then there's also that sweet, sweet, moves in the market."
"190980","192800"," There's some really good moves in the market."
"193000","201680"," You got, you know, you guys, we were sitting here all past couple days saying, just a moment here. "
"204140","207020"," Have some, uh, I've got some vocal cord issues."
"207240","211000"," So I've got hot, hot, like I was not hot, but like, I don't know, tea with honey."
"211580","213440"," Someone, I think Chan was recommending it the other day. "
"220920","221680"," Good morning."
"222080","228000"," Uh, hope you're all, uh, making money here or waiting to."
"231000","232660"," Put new shorts on the market. "
"242110","245650"," We'll, uh, take a look at the market real quick, but let's just talk about where we are at this"
"245650","246010"," moment."
"246150","246510"," Okay."
"247150","248490"," Let's any of you that are joining. "
"248490","249930"," There's only 50 viewers right now."

"251350","251710"," So. "
"253650","255290"," Uh, the 50 that are here."
"255589","256190"," I don't know how much here."
"256230","258529"," Actually, it gets kind of wonky when I'm looking at this stuff. "
"258990","259450"," Think tight here."
"262030","263190"," Close this right here."
"270200","270680"," Okay. "

"272620","272880"," One moment."
"280940","284120"," Let's get everybody in here first because we're not, we're having a little chat right here. "
"284140","284380"," Okay."
"285920","291240"," On Twitter, I posted and said it's probably not a bad time to be putting a hedge on."
"292140","294880"," I think that was, uh, right around here, right?"
"298240","299180"," Right around here. "

"335920","336620"," A bunch of gangsters."
"337760","338860"," I kid you not. "
"339100","344740"," Like, this is blowing my mind because, uh, you guys are showing up every day."
"344920","346520"," You guys are seeing all this stuff happen."
"346900","348940"," And we're kind of picking the moves here, right?"
"349060","350660"," We kind of know where the moves are. "
"352060","352900"," Relatively so."
"353120","358220"," I mean, do more than Robert, more than Brian, more Marcus, more than Roohawk, more than Devon."
"362630","364490"," We're calling it before it happens. "
"364790","366090"," You guys know we are, right?"
"366210","369310"," As a group, we're in here yesterday, and we're watching the divergence."
"369710","376890"," We got, we're taught, we actually discussed hypnotism about the interplay with HYG and JNK in the"
"376890","377170"," morning."
"377530","382210"," And then, of course, someone in the chat goes, Hey man, you see that divergence head in the clothes"
"382210","383150"," we talked about this morning?"
"383730","384470"," And there it was. "
"389270","392650"," Should have closed your calls for profit this morning and posted it on Twitter."
"393150","394450"," Take the money and run."
"395350","396570"," Like a hit job, right?"
"397210","398930"," We did that with puts the other day too, didn't we?"
"399450","399910"," Like last week?"
"400790","403270"," That was a big, that was a big printer actually. "
"403410","404830"," I made some serious money on that one."
"405370","410570"," So, let's, uh, just briefly, let's take a look."
"414860","416540"," Just take a look at the setup, okay?"
"418180","421480"," I think it's your wife's boyfriend that says this to people. "
"422200","424020"," People will be like, Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"426420","428600"," And you guys, whoever goes, go back and watch the tape."
"428780","429380"," It's all right there. "
"429880","431020"," He doesn't delete any of it."
"434340","437120"," Let me get your wife's boyfriend that says that to people, which is hilarious."
"438760","439780"," Why is it hilarious?"
"440060","443600"," Let's look at a five day chart and, and you know, let's, let's, let's talk about it real quick. "
"443600","444260"," Let's just die."
"444380","451030"," Let's just, let's dissect what our methodology was, right?"
"455040","457240"," Had this gorgeous down move, right?"
"457900","462620"," Five straight days of relentless selling came in here."
"468300","469200"," What do we do?"
"469640","471180"," We bought this bottom down here, right?"
"471180","477880"," I think it was, we had the high at nighttime and then we had the real money, or not really. "
"478060","480200"," So we had the dealers buying at nighttime, of course, one way up."
"480860","481800"," They sold the open."
"481980","483020"," We, we figured this would happen. "
"483020","484480"," We talked about this all on stream."
"486600","489120"," Came back up and in the stream, what did we say?"
"490020","492040"," We have to go, we said, take the money right here."
"493240","495000"," Got a nice print off that trade. "
"495180","496420"," This trade was actually two trades."
"496700","498660"," It took one, and we took a second one."
"498660","501860"," And both printed very well. "
"504080","505260"," Yesterday, we were in here."
"505440","506640"," What do we say yesterday?"
"507040","508160"," And what do we say actually on this?"
"508540","510680"," Matter of fact, we started this conversation back here."
"512539","516679"," And we said, we said, we don't know if it's going to take a day. "
"518360","520780"," We don't know if it's going to take two days, three days."
"520980","524420"," We didn't know if we'd take into Friday or Monday."
"524660","526320"," We didn't know when, but we knew at some point. "
"527620","530120"," We get some kind of an explosive move higher, right?"
"530580","532140"," We want to be buying the lows."
"532640","535940"," Talk about this yesterday, too, remember, talking about, hey, where do we want to buy it?"
"536320","538060"," We wanted to buy it even deeper yesterday, remember?"
"539140","541240"," Let's hope we get a deeper, a deeper sell."
"541400","542740"," We got that sell in the overnight. "
"547330","548430"," And what did we also know?"
"549690","552230"," We also knew yesterday, we knew before, right?"
"552610","553250"," What did we know before?"
"554930","555970"," What did we know yesterday?"
"557170","558890"," We knew we had sellers hiding, right?"
"563740","565640"," We knew they were in here yesterday."
"569060","574600"," We also knew yesterday that we had huge, huge standing orders over here, right?"
"577960","581980"," We also know that they're going to move up to over time depending on how we sell here."
"582860","586100"," Look at that bloodbath right here, right back to VWAP. "
"588720","590600"," Look at that bloodbath amazing."
"593160","595180"," I'm going to set up some levels for you today."
"595300","596580"," This is the perfect opportunity. "
"597100","599080"," Last night I posted about my hedge."
"599360","602480"," I've been talking about the hedge for days now, right?"
"602880","603660"," Week, two weeks?"
"604440","607220"," Matter of fact, I posted my hedge was up like, not upside down."
"607340","610760"," I was getting torched like a week and a half ago, two weeks ago. "
"613940","615120"," I ain't looking at it."
"615120","615880"," I'm not going to look at it."
"616440","620240"," Get an initial bounce reaction off of VWAP at this moment. "
"622060","623380"," Nice beautiful move, right?"
"623660","626000"," Slam down, trade it straight back up."
"627200","628660"," See what you guys are talking about real quick."
"628740","630240"," I'll put the book map on for you so you can. "
"632160","634500"," Let's have a look at book map real quick and see what's going on in the market."
"634640","636160"," Then we'll talk about the levels and stuff."
"647990","649350"," We're going to talk about Spagama. "
"649890","652330"," I asked yesterday somebody to tell me what they're saying."
"652790","654490"," I was interested in what they were saying."
"654990","656770"," What was the conversation yesterday?"
"657570","660830"," We're at a high risk of a rug pull. "
"661130","662710"," We're at a high risk of there's no."
"665270","667470"," I forget exactly what the conversation would have something to do."
"667730","670610"," Remember, I was like, hey, let's pull a call ratio. "
"671290","679510"," Take a look at it as like 0.68. You can see that the data suggested yesterday that there's no"
"679510","680030"," puts in the market."
"680150","680530"," There's no protection."
"680850","681330"," There's no hedging. "
"690030","694230"," There's some participant in some of this morning said it's glaring."
"694850","697270"," The puts are glaring because there's no calls in the market."
"699760","701280"," That's not completely true. "
"701820","703660"," That is not completely true."
"706540","708620"," I guess to an extent, it can be true."
"709560","711860"," But if you looked at the options market yesterday. "
"713720","715140"," Heading into the belly yesterday."
"716980","723700"," It was a, I don't know if it's a fake or a false representation of where the market's at."
"724580","730640"," Or it's being manipulated crude oil, which is extend losses, is burned down by more than a dollar a"
"730640","730940"," barrel. "
"731920","741000"," It's being manipulated off of a real data at some point throughout the day, and they're doing it"
"741000","741900"," frequently."
"742420","745120"," We'll take a look at that right now."
"747700","749420"," We looked at this yesterday. "
"749640","755180"," It's funny because then you come back a day later and it's happened and."
"759520","766180"," According to sources, Russia's no risk December oil loadings hampered by storms and two tankers"
"766180","768000"," arrived at nora risk."
"768800","772180"," Before the price cap have left without loading due to storms. "
"773360","776480"," There's a second"
"776480","784920"," here."
"794510","797970"," I think I've got stock charts.com as a member there."
"798310","800650"," I think maybe I can get a better chart in naked. "
"800650","801810"," I probably overlay this."
"802730","804910"," I'll try to get that done today if I can get to it."
"804970","810170"," I had some, if you look at the YouTube channel, they got a bunch of stuff changing on how it"
"810170","810950"," looks and stuff. "
"811170","813110"," We're doing some work in the background."
"814170","815370"," I've got something to tell you guys."
"815570","816790"," I've got something exciting to tell you. "
"819090","820570"," It's something exciting to tell you this morning."
"821010","824850"," I'm trying to work with, so the tools that I use."
"826750","833910"," I'm trying right now to work with some of those service providers and trying to maybe develop a"
"833910","841530"," class series and how to use those tools so that if you are joining us for the first time, you"
"841530","842570"," can go to those classes. "
"843390","844490"," They'll be public and free."
"844730","847490"," They're not going to be behind anything, kind of paywall or anything like that."
"848010","852890"," As I release them, you'll see you move the watch them along with me and we're going to talk so"
"852890","858790"," that we can use these tools together and you'll have, if you don't have any idea what the heck is"
"858790","864790"," going on, that you should be able to go back and reference what we're talking about in stream. "
"865890","867150"," That's just a new announcement."
"867730","868990"," Hopefully those deals come together."
"873110","874090"," We'll see how that works. "
"874250","878590"," I'm hoping that works out because it's going to help you be a better trader."
"878850","882950"," It's going to help you to make a higher win rate."
"885350","886570"," Just taking a look at this. "
"886670","888070"," This is just a one-year chart."
"890170","894790"," You know it would be one thing if we were seeing an increase in this put call ratio that was"
"894790","895210"," just rising."
"896470","900850"," You can see how wide some of these peaks are here. "
"901070","901870"," See this trend up."
"902570","905950"," Just have a higher number of puts in the market."
"906630","908190"," The thing is seeing these irrational spikes. "
"909010","913370"," When you see these spikes go up and down, it's showing that they're short dated."
"914110","915810"," They're pointed at specific times."
"919590","923590"," Yesterday I was talking to Joe on the phone and I was like, man, I was like, I'm trying to"
"923590","929470"," think of when I've seen a put call ratio of 1.5. I was like, I have to look this"
"929470","929870"," stuff up. "
"929870","934270"," I was like, I have to look this stuff up because I don't remember, but I remember when I learned"
"934270","935190"," about the put call ratio."
"935490","938990"," I remember when I was first talking about it, I was always told, if you ever see a 1.5"
"938990","941350"," rating, it's a huge market bottom."
"941810","942850"," It's that high. "
"943630","944810"," And I looked for it yesterday."
"944810","945450"," I couldn't find."
"946310","951030"," I found some some stuff that I had originally read how I learned about it, but I didn't see that"
"951030","951970"," exact number. "
"953370","955630"," The last night I went and looked and I'm like, what?"
"955890","957130"," I'm like, what the f is this?"
"958390","958830"," Right?"
"959150","961510"," And let's just context wise, right?"
"963770","970440"," I mean, this is the height right here is March 12."
"972280","972640"," 2020."
"973080","975000"," You guys know what was going on in March 12, 2020?"
"975660","976220"," It was wild. "
"978700","980120"," It was buck wild."
"981960","986440"," If you look over time, though, if you were to, if you were to track this over time, yes, they"
"986440","990820"," don't have a, I don't have any white charts to count, but let's just go back in just five years."
"991100","992940"," Can I do, can I do Max, maybe?"
"993820","993840"," Sweet. "
"995380","998360"," I guess Max is five or five years or so."
"999120","1006220"," I mean, even this spike right here is this is a reading from December 21, 2018."
"1006680","1008360"," These are rare occurrences. "
"1009200","1017720"," If you were to go back and check this, this though, into the 2010s and the 2000s and further back."
"1019360","1022500"," There are other trading view offers, some of this data."
"1023380","1025940"," You'll find that the peak. "
"1025940","1028480"," It was typically at the end."
"1028900","1029640"," It's the bottom."
"1029920","1031740"," It's, it's never front ran. "
"1031920","1036200"," It's always the FOMO at the end that spikes these readings."
"1036839","1038500"," And we're not seeing that right now."
"1038599","1039339"," We're seeing it. "
"1039960","1040700"," Front run."
"1041300","1042819"," I saw some arguments yesterday about."
"1044720","1048600"," Large stakeholders that maybe hold tons of tons of, of a."
"1050000","1050800"," Of spy. "
"1052140","1054640"," You know, like you own spy, right?"
"1054860","1058940"," And you're just throwing shit ticket version set, but tickets out to the wind saying, well, I don't"
"1058940","1062640"," mind if I, if I have to buy it at this price, if it goes that low anyways, you know,"
"1062860","1065060"," I'll, I'll cap or I'll monetize a bunch of puts."
"1065940","1070300"," You know, having never seen front running like this."
"1071740","1073260"," Historically in our stock market. "
"1074260","1076000"," I don't know what that means."
"1076640","1078440"," I've got some ideas of what it means."
"1078720","1080720"," I'm interested in what you think it means. "
"1082640","1083800"," But this is a problem."
"1084200","1085700"," I want you to know that this is a problem."
"1085780","1086840"," This is a major problem. "
"1089060","1092460"," And the every time we're doing this, this since."
"1094900","1095780"," October 13th."
"1095780","1098960"," I think I can count like 10 to 20 times. "
"1099600","1101420"," Now this is actually driven the market higher."
"1102300","1105780"," We're getting the, we're actually, it's happening close to events too."
"1106380","1108000"," So we're signing it to events. "
"1108000","1113780"," Hey, it's because of this event, because what they said in reality, it might have more to do with."
"1116340","1120500"," A manipulation of the market hoping for real money equity selling."
"1120920","1125000"," To follow that right where the options market does not drive. "
"1125720","1129120"," The real price of the of the underlying."
"1130200","1133800"," Ticker and hoping that it's being timed appropriately."
"1134400","1135520"," Almost like it's being hidden. "
"1137880","1139620"," In a week moments in the market."
"1140720","1142180"," And we saw that late last night."
"1142280","1146880"," I was not I was up until late watching the watching the minis. "
"1146880","1149300"," I was like, do I have to short the market in the overnight?"
"1149920","1150840"," Because there was there was."
"1151720","1155220"," Or at least topically looked like, Hey, if the market breaks right here."
"1156160","1161360"," You don't want to be waking up in the morning to down 6000 points or something, right?"
"1162080","1163840"," Not 6000, but you know what I mean?"
"1165540","1168020"," These numbers aren't registering during the day. "
"1168220","1173040"," These numbers are like this data is not coming out until after or near market close."
"1181660","1185040"," So I'm kind of kind of a weird place, right?"
"1185240","1187220"," We're now some down below a VWAP right now."
"1188540","1189140"," Let me see. "
"1189220","1190520"," Give me a second here."
"1190640","1193260"," Seven is right now to get the four week bill auctions."
"1193600","1196180"," You're selling four to five billion dollars of four week bills. "
"1196560","1200160"," We're probably to cover a free to 43 and a prior high yield of free spot."
"1200540","1202700"," 95% still negative."
"1202700","1204420"," I was still selling into strength. "
"1205340","1211050"," We're going to see if we catch a bounce here."
"1217910","1219170"," I've never encountered it."
"1219250","1220150"," I've never seen it. "
"1220550","1223530"," And now the put car ratio is not something that you should be using."
"1224310","1226410"," Well, you can in a general sense."
"1226790","1233030"," If you look at a put car ratio over a month or so and the market's going down and the"
"1233030","1237590"," put car ratio climbs slowly with the decline in the market. "
"1239290","1241430"," That's not an abnormality."
"1241690","1243270"," That's what you expect to see."
"1244270","1246570"," It's like a second or third tier research. "
"1248470","1252330"," School you would have something of something that you use, but you're not relying upon it."
"1252730","1255190"," But the abnormality that we're seeing is what?"
"1256890","1258550"," It's being front round, right?"
"1258690","1259550"," It's being front round the market."
"1263750","1265750"," So I should have screenshot it yesterday. "
"1267030","1268670"," But yesterday into the bell."
"1270010","1272730"," There was a matter of fact, I'll bring it up right now."
"1272730","1278050"," I don't remember exactly where it was, but there was a, so yesterday into the bell. "
"1278990","1285370"," There was a large position that was two or three strikes outside of the money."
"1286990","1291770"," It was like 120,000 contracts or something and then it disappeared."
"1292850","1293770"," It was gone. "
"1294510","1297550"," And then I saw them jump to the call side briefly and they went out."
"1300210","1306670"," I saw my calls go down to like 30 cents or something turned off the tasty and I was like,"
"1306730","1307030"," you know what?"
"1307230","1308050"," I'm not going to look at it."
"1308210","1309070"," I'm not going to add to it. "
"1309090","1309750"," I'm just going to leave it alone."
"1310690","1311730"," I came back later."
"1313350","1319410"," And the nighttime as we were going was we were trying to read or test whatever that channel is on"
"1319410","1320990"," the previous on the previous contract. "
"1322130","1325190"," Hopefully most of you haven't rolled over to the March contract, but."
"1325190","1328430"," It was just it was the last one to break."
"1329610","1331410"," SVX a broken spy broken. "
"1331990","1332830"," Of course, there's."
"1333070","1340250"," I hate what is the huge difference between the March and the Friday contract or see the December"
"1340250","1342070"," and the March contract on ES."
"1342470","1344130"," That's the only channel that hadn't really broken. "
"1345610","1347310"," And of course, last night it was down there."
"1349310","1354370"," Tapping on and trying to try to kind of poke itself through to open the door to lower to lower"
"1354370","1355310"," lows big lower lows."
"1355650","1356050"," Now. "
"1358550","1359810"," It's so happened to go."
"1359970","1360090"," All right."
"1360250","1360590"," That's what happened. "
"1360710","1361810"," I went back into the."
"1362470","1362870"," Tasty."
"1363670","1365650"," I'm like, Oh, at some points will last. "
"1366650","1369810"," Maybe the last 15 minutes or half an hour."
"1369870","1372790"," Maybe maybe three 30 or three forty five four fifteen."
"1374290","1376970"," They had repositioned and two different strikes. "
"1379390","1383630"," Large, large volume of contracts on zero days."
"1384310","1385850"," These aren't down the road puts."
"1386430","1388650"," You can see it because they come off every day. "
"1389090","1390770"," You'll see the spike up and the spike down have that."
"1390970","1394490"," If they were longer dated puts, you would see the spike up and it would hold there."
"1395310","1399250"," See that they're coming in coming out coming in coming out coming in coming out. "
"1401030","1402390"," I don't know if this is a."
"1404010","1407230"," Like a you guys saw the post that Seder made."
"1409190","1411350"," About the banks using AI."
"1412570","1413470"," And they're partners. "
"1413650","1417910"," They're AI partnership with Microsoft assuming you guys may have seen that."
"1420470","1421550"," And there's that there."
"1421630","1423090"," They're highlighting this the section. "
"1423110","1423930"," So I don't know if it's."
"1425090","1428410"," High frequency trading for like a high net of high freeze trading for a firm."
"1428570","1430470"," Like a high frequency trading bank. "
"1432910","1436710"," Or if it's like a Mike Barry kind of a thing that wouldn't shock me either."
"1437850","1439170"," It's a lot of money too."
"1439830","1441370"," It's a big money. "
"1443230","1444290"," I don't know if it's a human."
"1444490","1446810"," I don't know who it's who's doing it."
"1447930","1449190"," I don't think we've ever seen it. "
"1449330","1451910"," If you guys think that we have seen this in the past."
"1453470","1454850"," Direct me to a."
"1455690","1458290"," A white paper direct me to a."
"1459290","1464110"," A news article from a decade ago or two decades or three decades decades ago."
"1464430","1466070"," And once I've ever seen anything like this. "
"1466910","1469390"," Has been when we've had different."
"1471830","1472770"," Jumpson in."
"1473670","1474950"," In technology. "
"1476270","1477710"," In the 1988 crash."
"1478450","1479090"," 2010."
"1479370","1481330"," I think 2006 to a few times with market. "
"1481990","1483790"," We everybody using the same stuff."
"1485310","1489450"," Last week I was talking to Joe Rogan or Joe Rogan Joe donut about this."
"1489650","1492510"," Five minutes away now to get the four week bill auction. "
"1492790","1495730"," So the US selling forty five billion dollars of four week bills."
"1496350","1501090"," We're private to cover a free to forty three and a prior high yield of free spot to nine five"
"1501090","1501510"," percent."
"1502290","1506610"," So last week we're talking about that new AI that came out and I said there was. "
"1507210","1508470"," Real major risk."
"1509990","1514610"," If you have so if you have banks using that kind of an AI and then you've got."
"1515130","1519430"," Like a retail swarm almost of traders around the world. "
"1519490","1521310"," You're going to develop that stuff."
"1521990","1522770"," You could see."
"1523530","1527070"," The entire market knowing when to buy knowing when to sell same time. "
"1528250","1530070"," You could create some kind of a."
"1534610","1536490"," Some kind of some kind of a."
"1536490","1539270"," A swarm everybody in the same."
"1539510","1542190"," We could actually shake the market to pieces together."
"1543950","1545190"," It would be all banked. "
"1545410","1547990"," It's really weird phenomena that could take place."
"1548390","1549930"," It could lead to something that could break."
"1551350","1551790"," Markets. "
"1553010","1556750"," I don't know enough about it yet to know how damaging it could be."
"1557690","1558970"," But I said to Joe I said."
"1559690","1562730"," There's a real possibility at some point you could see someone skip band. "
"1563550","1564370"," You get caught using it."
"1564870","1566890"," Where it goes that hive."
"1567390","1572330"," A hive mentality across the market. "
"1577550","1580910"," And then there was something else that we've been talking about in this channel for a few weeks now"
"1580910","1582950"," right we said the feds lying right."
"1583650","1586590"," Matter of fact for the past couple months I've told you have been packaging."
"1587910","1591410"," They're telling you that they're not they're telling you that they're not applying. "
"1591650","1595490"," What they're doing is they're taking out the books and then saying we'll spread it out over the"
"1595490","1597110"," next two or three generations of the back end."
"1598050","1598990"," The fed is lying to you."
"1599030","1599690"," I want you to know that. "
"1600830","1602370"," That is not doing QT."
"1602630","1603430"," I promise you that."
"1604110","1605810"," I told you that on Twitter. "
"1606170","1607430"," I told you that I'm not captain's off."
"1607590","1608470"," I've told you that in stream."
"1610270","1611210"," Twenty times. "
"1612110","1613110"," Matter of fact."
"1615330","1617650"," Janae Marcus three or four months ago."
"1618910","1621890"," Posted a link to the mechanics of how they're doing QT. "
"1622310","1623090"," It's a scam."
"1624330","1625790"," If you actually went and read."
"1625790","1631750"," We went down the rabbit hole reading the really dry awful stuff scam whole thing is a scam. "
"1633490","1635730"," It's showing itself in the data right now that it's a scam."
"1651930","1656310"," So these are like big, big, big thinker kind of topic."
"1656550","1656650"," Right. "
"1657030","1659170"," You just extend gains up by five percent."
"1660810","1662910"," I'm going to set some charts up for you."
"1663010","1664250"," Nice little bounce right down here. "
"1665430","1667210"," Perfect cell opportunity right down here."
"1667210","1673550"," Bull's going to be wanting to keep Vwap and make another attack higher and market profile levels by"
"1673550","1675770"," signing up to the tick dot com."
"1676490","1679290"," These real sellers above here, but I do want to warn you. "
"1680790","1682450"," I'm going to warn you something here."
"1695820","1697420"," Pin strike for 10."
"1697600","1698400"," This is where it started right. "
"1699680","1701340"," It happened again, right."
"1701340","1703420"," Right off the bell, right."
"1704760","1707360"," Now you're going to have an argument here for a measured move up. "
"1709580","1713940"," You know where the old channel was or maybe you'll hear bull start to tell you that there's going"
"1713940","1715860"," to be a new channel down here or something like that."
"1716880","1718240"," Do you want you to know that?"
"1721080","1721760"," They're there."
"1722040","1723260"," I promise you that they're there. "
"1724640","1727020"," I promise you 100% that they're waiting."
"1735320","1739580"," I'm sure at some point you're going to hear an argument from bull saying trend reversal."
"1740420","1743380"," I think even post that I can smell for 4300. "
"1743380","1743780"," I can."
"1745640","1747240"," It's a long shot."
"1748420","1751800"," There's some mechanical reasons why that could happen to right. "
"1752660","1755360"," Which is what we've seen since early October."
"1757000","1758620"," You're getting you're getting really."
"1760180","1761540"," Really risky. "
"1764740","1770480"," Market crash trades that are forcing the market higher until those leave."
"1771140","1773420"," So let me explain this simply."
"1774760","1779280"," You'll sometimes you'll hear people say can't have a market crash until there's complacency. "
"1781140","1782960"," So you're like, okay, that makes sense, right?"
"1783760","1787040"," Well, you've got someone leaning on it so hard."
"1790860","1791920"," It's like a thumb on."
"1792060","1793020"," It's like a thumb on it. "
"1793760","1798340"," And until that whoever that entity is stops doing that, you're not going to get a decline."
"1798340","1800380"," You're not going to get the decline you're expecting."
"1800820","1805020"," You're not going to get like major blow off channel top. "
"1805340","1809260"," I don't know if that's the best way to describe it while they're doing this."
"1809760","1811380"," Brad on Twitter was saying it this morning."
"1811380","1816380"," And it's the box as we should use and seize the window of opportunity on the Northern Ireland"
"1816380","1816980"," protocol talks. "
"1818760","1824700"," Maybe at an event day or something that might work or key key levels might work, right?"
"1825720","1828480"," They did it right at the top, but that channel over here, right?"
"1828720","1832620"," So, you know, it's like, it's like, oh, if we hit this number, it'll probably work."
"1832720","1836820"," We'll get some selling some profit taking actually from October 13th at 4 10."
"1836980","1837760"," There was some profit taking. "
"1838020","1839960"," So I'm going to slam it down with some zero date books."
"1839960","1841500"," It really is manipulation."
"1842080","1843900"," I don't know if you can see that or not. "
"1845020","1848000"," So it's just, and then, of course, if you get one wrong, who cares?"
"1848720","1849780"," If you all you do is get what?"
"1850040","1853820"," One out of three, one out of five, but that kind of money for it to print quite well."
"1860260","1861360"," What coffee do I prefer?"
"1861700","1862020"," Who is that?"
"1862880","1863940"," I guess I'm going to button the chat."
"1872180","1872500"," Yeah. "
"1872640","1873940"," I like it."
"1874180","1874840"," I like us, though."
"1875240","1879940"," I like us, though, because there's a lot of people in it in the trade and. "
"1881940","1885660"," I like it because if you buy it in the money and farther enough, far enough out in time, you"
"1885660","1886580"," just need it to hit it."
"1887020","1888300"," You're looking for a huge spike."
"1888300","1890100"," You're not, you're not trying to make money off it. "
"1890180","1890700"," You're trying to."
"1891480","1895940"," It's called protect yourself against the high yield three spot, six, five."
"1896300","1902360"," Events to the US selling 46 billion dollars of four week bills and awards 87 spot, zero spot, two"
"1902360","1903240"," percent of it's a high. "
"1904020","1905680"," Yeah, we're going to change these levels."
"1905940","1907240"," The levels of change this morning."
"1907740","1913040"," I have levels on another computer, another instance of this, but not on this instance. "
"1914440","1916700"," So we'll, we'll adjust them this morning."
"1918040","1918940"," Just a second here."
"1919920","1924540"," So that's the question someone just said, someone just said, oh, someone just said, ergo said, is"
"1924540","1925800"," our one becoming support now?"
"1925940","1926100"," No. "
"1927880","1929620"," So bulls have work to do, right?"
"1931560","1932540"," It is not."
"1932740","1936480"," We're still in, we're still in some kind of a negative a game environment in here."
"1937240","1941880"," You're going to still see sellers coming down, repositioning for lower lows. "
"1943120","1947400"," You wouldn't switch from a bearish stance to a bullish stance."
"1948200","1949600"," Unless a few things happen."
"1949940","1952540"," You'd need to have either time on your side. "
"1953940","1954140"," Right."
"1954400","1955060"," Time of consolidation."
"1957120","1960680"," And you'd need to have a break above into positive gamma. "
"1961540","1962860"," Say I'm bullish now."
"1963680","1966380"," You would see less selling and selling of the rips, right?"
"1966380","1971380"," When you're when you're looking for is the market being supported for moves higher?"
"1971900","1974480"," Or is the market being sold at key levels?"
"1974820","1974980"," They are."
"1975120","1977820"," They're still being rips are still being sold into strength. "
"1978600","1985660"," You want to see support a supportive market show itself over time and key key levels, right?"
"1985940","1990740"," That we're back to our above zero gamma into positive gamma, not in a negative a gamma environment."
"1991620","1992740"," So you're not seeing that."
"1992820","1995820"," Is this productive for bulls on its surface?"
"1996080","2001460"," It is, but it's not in any way shaped like, Hey, I should put because I should change my stance. "
"2002400","2005380"," Now, so you should keep the stance of being a bearish here."
"2006620","2007820"," Until proven otherwise."
"2008420","2014800"," If there is a move going higher, if you're a bull and you're, I don't know, having fever dreams"
"2014800","2015940"," that we're going up from here. "
"2020080","2020940"," Oh, look at that."
"2021020","2022740"," Remember we tried this out yesterday?"
"2022740","2024200"," We're two days ago, right?"
"2025060","2026740"," Kind of in that track, aren't we?"
"2026940","2027360"," See that?"
"2027540","2029600"," See that dotted line?"
"2029640","2032780"," Look at that."
"2033080","2034040"," It was sold right off it. "
"2034580","2036420"," You guys remember us drawing this together?"
"2037140","2038280"," Everyone I free handed this?"
"2040720","2042620"," I just remember I free handed this for you."
"2046540","2048360"," I wanted this so bad down here."
"2049020","2053659"," I wanted I wanted this sweet, sweet by the PJ traders got it though. "
"2053780","2054380"," They got it down here."
"2055300","2057060"," They weren't going to give it to cash market."
"2059739","2068500"," Now, if you were, if you were a bull and you're like, is the market going to try to go"
"2068500","2071440"," up and slam that for 2430 or whatever?"
"2072060","2073540"," You need to see productivity, right?"
"2074480","2082560"," So you want to see us maybe come up here and regain this channel or establish a channel where"
"2082560","2083520"," eventually we cross. "
"2085820","2088179"," We would cross into some positive gamma."
"2088380","2094100"," So if you start to see productive work, I'm assuming that you're not assuming you're going to get"
"2094100","2097060"," more more resistance to this idea and a breakdown."
"2097980","2103500"," But if you were to see this kind of a move break above higher into positive gamma, you would then"
"2103500","2111480"," take that stance of, hey, we're going to start trading higher into some known large supply zones,"
"2111640","2111720"," right?"
"2111720","2112740"," We know where those are already. "
"2113060","2114440"," We know they got the gap of 420."
"2115680","2119500"," We got some targets way higher, 430, 440."
"2121740","2123460"," And there's some room now to go higher. "
"2123640","2124820"," I was actually looking last night."
"2124980","2129080"," I haven't talked about this at all, but I was looking at the room to go down."
"2130140","2132240"," And there's less and less room to go down. "
"2132640","2133560"," It really is."
"2134260","2136140"," In a full move down, there's not that much."
"2136140","2144100"," And I was looking back on some 10 and 20 or charts to see where the depth of market was"
"2144100","2145780"," going much farther back. "
"2148940","2152440"," And yeah, you'd need to see a lot of a lot more work in here."
"2154520","2161500"," I do see that if you can get deep enough into if you can get deep enough down here, if"
"2161500","2163180"," you get kind of like 380 or something."
"2164420","2167440"," I'm looking at from perspective of, we're at 3E. "
"2168520","2170300"," 430 is 500 points."
"2171840","2174920"," I'm like, I guess you're saying if you were a bit large bank."
"2176280","2178360"," Does a large bank think on. "
"2180320","2183880"," So let's say the initial market reaction was up."
"2185620","2186980"," On FMC news."
"2190360","2194300"," The initial market reaction might be blasting the market higher a couple of weeks. "
"2194720","2200360"," If that was the case, you wouldn't want to be caught off sides on that trade."
"2202120","2204160"," I haven't talked about this except for a few people."
"2204360","2205900"," You wouldn't want to be caught off sides on that trade. "
"2206160","2207020"," Let's say the market was at."
"2208380","2208660"," 410."
"2211140","2212200"," And the market ripped. "
"2213520","2215280"," Instead of blowing through previous."
"2216240","2219200"," Previous eyes on the downward slope for the year."
"2219720","2223600"," You might get overrun if you were a bank by a market sentiment. "
"2224360","2227000"," So you trade it down as deep as you can get it."
"2228140","2229520"," If there's good news."
"2230740","2232060"," And there's a positive market reaction. "
"2232340","2237000"," You can now breathe and sell into strength on a potential 500 move."
"2238500","2240280"," If you're down here."
"2242440","2247300"," You're saying we're going to sell down 500 points in a week or two down to 3300. "
"2247940","2248500"," Unlikely."
"2249600","2252480"," So if you can, if you're back and you can trade this down."
"2254120","2255680"," Give some breathing room, I guess. "
"2256000","2256820"," I would say."
"2258000","2260160"," To a potential rip higher."
"2262370","2267610"," I'm not going to get into that here because it's a very theoretical and it's based upon. "
"2268630","2269990"," Trying to anticipate."
"2270490","2273590"," What larger players are wanting to do or."
"2280190","2282970"," If you're, let's say you were a bank, right?"
"2283470","2284890"," I shouldn't talk about this stuff, but. "
"2285390","2288650"," Let's say you're a bank and you're trying to."
"2289730","2290290"," Unload."
"2290910","2293450"," A large position in the spy. "
"2293690","2295850"," That's why I have spider product of some guy."
"2295930","2297710"," It doesn't really matter."
"2298730","2300250"," And you want to do it safely. "
"2302570","2304170"," If you were trying to do that, right?"
"2310390","2311250"," Think tight here."
"2312290","2314150"," Then you're in, we're coming into an event."
"2315730","2320660"," So just noting some outside movement to WCI after that news. "
"2322500","2323680"," The second here."
"2327640","2328800"," Recaptured VWAP."
"2330140","2331040"," Took profit. "
"2331860","2335600"," Holding VWAP coming back up into breaking through right now."
"2337840","2339060"," But if you're a bank."
"2343030","2343830"," You just second here. "
"2348010","2351530"," If you're a bank and you wanted to sell into strength."
"2353010","2356070"," And not get run over right where the market keeps going up."
"2356730","2360570"," Because, you know, key, key levels are broken or whatever. "
"2362090","2363350"," Which is possible, right?"
"2365750","2367290"," Let me get rid of some of this stuff here."
"2381300","2382440"," Just a second."
"2388370","2389990"," Market pump's going, let's go. "
"2390910","2393190"," I think there's a bull trap up here personally."
"2401810","2402850"," Hang tight here."
"2404850","2406770"," Let me just say, we're looking for here. "
"2422810","2431270"," Okay, there we go."
"2444120","2445040"," We've got a."
"2454250","2456430"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"2456910","2459210"," This is now your pivot point for today, right?"
"2459390","2461510"," Those are in charge today, your intraday. "
"2462310","2464390"," So you can see that your intraday right here."
"2464410","2465410"," Your pivot point this morning."
"2465410","2467190"," If you guys are putting your levels. "
"2468970","2472530"," If you guys are putting your levels on every morning before the start of the day."
"2472730","2474770"," We tagged the pivot point almost exactly right."
"2476410","2476830"," 39359. "
"2481610","2498800"," I think they're kind of"
"2498800","2500920"," weird when I'm a cursor on this."
"2505100","2506660"," This right here is your R1."
"2511060","2512660"," Smashed right through R1, right?"
"2512880","2513680"," Came into some supply. "
"2514900","2515780"," Tagged R1."
"2516000","2517980"," Now we're looking above to where?"
"2536750","2537910"," Hang tight here for a minute."
"2555700","2558360"," Almost perfect tags right R1, R2 this morning. "
"2586420","2587980"," Same place up here, right?"
"2587980","2590560"," R3, this is an STX cell up here."
"2592240","2593800"," Those huge sellers are."
"2615020","2617340"," This is where I wanted to buy yesterday, right?"
"2618180","2619540"," I wanted to buy that. "
"2619720","2621320"," What's now S1 today?"
"2656880","2659080"," Trade from level to level, right?"
"2661520","2661960"," 787."
"2674130","2675330"," Right there for you."
"2679350","2693630"," I'm going to mute"
"2693630","2694410"," this out real quick. "
"2694550","2695350"," I want to show you guys this."
"2704790","2707950"," Remember we started drawing this channel on the roll over back here?"
"2710850","2718730"," We'll watch them come in, right?"
"2719270","2720230"," Sell this, sell this."
"2721210","2723510"," Watching a reversal take place right now, right?"
"2723670","2726890"," We haven't done a measurement, but it's probably somewhere right around here. "
"2727270","2728390"," About 50% of the move, right?"
"2729750","2735230"," When you guys are out there watching, you guys are out there and you're watching."
"2736630","2739030"," A decent sell off of the bull flag."
"2739430","2740730"," How much is this move?"
"2742150","2744570"," Are you expecting to get back, right?"
"2744810","2745190"," Trade higher?"
"2745450","2746170"," Do you guys know?"
"2746530","2749270"," I think some of you probably know, some of you don't. "
"2750150","2752850"," That's usually roughly 50% of the move."
"2753710","2755550"," Sometimes you have a brief break above."
"2759970","2761670"," Like 60%, 70% or so. "
"2762470","2767290"," That's where you get your, this is your first one I guess would be right here."
"2768670","2770550"," All right, I guess they're expecting right now."
"2771470","2773790"," Bull's would tell you that the first one should be right here. "
"2775250","2776370"," That'd be a 50% right."
"2776830","2777550"," Next move up."
"2778450","2779770"," Start coming down over here. "
"2781410","2783410"," See how I drew that the other day."
"2791310","2793210"," So bull's gonna tell you today it's not done."
"2794470","2795990"," Bull's gonna tell you we're going up some more. "
"2795990","2797150"," I haven't measured it yet."
"2799770","2802930"," But this is kind of an implied what you're looking for."
"2804490","2807070"," Now, so 50% of the move you should get back. "
"2807210","2811350"," Sometimes it's only 38%, but 50% is not unreasonable to expect."
"2811690","2814230"," 60 or 70 is always possible for a brief moment."
"2816250","2819290"," Key places to be looking for for reversal in the market. "
"2819910","2820370"," I'll measure it."
"2820590","2821950"," I'll have some time this morning this afternoon."
"2821950","2823270"," I'll do an exact measure on it. "
"2823270","2825130"," But it's somewhere in here, I promise you."
"2826370","2829210"," Reasonable expectation to assume we're gonna go up some more here."
"2829650","2831330"," And maybe in tomorrow, today or tomorrow. "
"2833450","2836610"," But as a bull, you can't say this is a reversal, right?"
"2838050","2839110"," No way, shape or form."
"2839270","2840590"," You can think that this is a reversal."
"2845990","2851790"," So crude off futures, reversal losses and Brent turns positive after falling by more than one"
"2851790","2852470"," dollar barrel. "
"2852470","2855530"," Don't forget, you did have the headline earlier on."
"2856290","2857990"," I don't know if I can measure on this."
"2858190","2859190"," It's maybe seven a.m. eastern time. "
"2859370","2863870"," The TC energy declares a force majeur on the Keystone oil pipeline."
"2864550","2865370"," I don't know if I can measure."
"2865870","2867510"," Let me do a measure saying some exact. "
"2867910","2868590"," I don't know if this."
"2870970","2872830"," I usually do my measuring on trading view."
"2872950","2876050"," Let me see if there's a measuring tool. "
"2879680","2880720"," Looks like there is."
"2886430","2887290"," I'm doing this wrong."
"2887290","2895380"," I guess they do have, they do have measuring tools here. "
"2895460","2896140"," Do that, don't they?"
"2908440","2911200"," I don't know if I can make this like a different color."
"2911720","2913940"," Yes, we, I don't think you guys can see this."
"2914000","2915280"," We'll, I'll meet this over here. "
"2919320","2922990"," I'll be honest with you, I don't do a lot of research over here."
"2923050","2925090"," It's like just a fast day trading chart."
"2925870","2928650"," So 50% is going to be the top of this red box. "
"2931950","2932590"," Right here."
"2933910","2935610"," Sometimes you'll see a peak above."
"2943880","2947700"," You can make one more mark right here just in case you could do another one. "
"2949320","2950200"," That's 61%."
"2950200","2955260"," That's, I mean, this is, I'd expect like 70, 78% maybe from Tesla."
"2955960","2957200"," I doubt you get this one over here. "
"2958160","2959540"," We put that back in the."
"2962420","2963420"," I'll get rid of this."
"2964960","2965820"," Hold on a minute here. "
"2968440","2969820"," Usually it's at the points, right?"
"2974490","2975270"," Come on now."
"2976730","2977130"," Okay."
"2977550","2978390"," So we're going to dump that. "
"2979530","2980450"," We don't need that there."
"2996580","3000260"," I think it was a 50% right about here right where my cursor is."
"3002100","3004040"," 68 right up here, 70s up here. "
"3005880","3008280"," I don't like the stock like Tesla."
"3008580","3011180"," I'd be like, yeah, you want to go up to 78 or 71%."
"3012040","3013540"," Like a reverse retracement. "
"3021070","3022670"," You know, the 50s going to be reasonable."
"3023790","3024530"," Could have something."
"3024730","3025910"," Sometimes you'll see it like this. "
"3026050","3028270"," You'll see like the double, triple top, everything head and shoulders."
"3028270","3029010"," They call it."
"3030130","3032270"," Then you'll still continue down over here. "
"3034730","3035730"," So does this move over?"
"3035930","3036530"," Probably not."
"3037210","3038650"," There are probably traps up in here."
"3038990","3039570"," Probably right there. "
"3040430","3041650"," Might not even get the first shoulder."
"3042930","3044150"," You know, like think we're heading up here."
"3044310","3045910"," They just blast you right at right down in here. "
"3050990","3053630"," So where would you be looking for for major sellers?"
"3055370","3056110"," What was that again?"
"3056270","3058410"," Was it the top of that red box or was it the bottom of that red box?"
"3058770","3059510"," Let me just take over time."
"3066240","3067040"," Top of the box."
"3084220","3085140"," We'll put that in there. "
"3095200","3097340"," Look at these big giant gap down here."
"3097560","3098640"," I put the bears or how on there."
"3098760","3101680"," Like I want to come back to the gap and then you can go up there and get your 50%. "
"3105100","3108960"," Bulls and bears are like permabares and permables."
"3109200","3116260"," I always love to move this over tomorrow if we need to."
"3117000","3117840"," So you can see it. "
"3118860","3121100"," I always love permabares and permables because I always ask."
"3121760","3123460"," They're always asking the important questions."
"3124620","3125440"," They're always like. "
"3126660","3127320"," All right."
"3128340","3131120"," You'll think today you'd speak to a permable and a permabare."
"3131880","3132560"," First question guaranteed. "
"3133880","3135900"," Well, we have to come back down here and close this gap."
"3136580","3140040"," And then you're allowed to go up here."
"3140740","3144700"," Now, of course, the moment you close this gap, the permabare is going to be like, oh, baby, we're"
"3144700","3145240"," going down. "
"3145500","3146080"," Break it down."
"3147940","3152500"," You know, the permable, of course, is like, well, I didn't take the trade here cap."
"3153140","3156760"," I didn't take the bounce off the pivot point that we talk about every day this morning cap. "
"3157400","3164280"," And now that we've traded up hair cap, can we go straight to the 50% retracement like right now?"
"3168280","3174340"," You always love the, always love the, uh, the permables and permabares."
"3183140","3184900"," I'm going to set up a trade here with you."
"3189600","3191900"," You know, I got a lot going on in the background to you guys. "
"3192100","3204260"," There's a lot of hard work to get some stuff"
"3204260","3205220"," rolling out to you guys."
"3212170","3213230"," Let's take a look at the market."
"3213470","3214470"," What's going on in the options chain?"
"3214610","3215450"," Again, you won't get this going on?"
"3215570","3215790"," Oh, yeah. "
"3215930","3218790"," There goes the bears loading up on puts."
"3220430","3221750"," That's a new position, by the way."
"3222350","3223450"," That's not the same position. "
"3224770","3229710"," There's that, like, so December 8th puts, uh, 200,000 contracts on 395P."
"3230650","3234510"," Different, different, different person, different algo, different computer, different software"
"3234510","3235070"," doing that."
"3242700","3245200"," Uh, you guys want to know where I want to buy, right?"
"3246220","3247400"," You guys know where I want to buy?"
"3247720","3248060"," I'll show you. "
"3249600","3251340"," Uh, I'll show you what my thinking is."
"3251420","3251560"," Okay."
"3254420","3261790"," So just, let's look at, uh, let's, uh, so if I was just coming to the market just now, show"
"3261790","3263710"," up to the market, taking a look at what I'm looking for. "
"3264130","3266090"," Came down, met with some demand, right?"
"3267010","3267530"," Went higher."
"3268870","3270150"," We found some supply, right?"
"3271210","3272210"," Supply sold us down."
"3273790","3274670"," Demand stepped in. "
"3276750","3277550"," Said, nope."
"3278270","3278610"," Right?"
"3279310","3281930"," So you're expecting some volatility in here, right?"
"3282990","3284870"," You already know we have resistance in R2."
"3285070","3287970"," We're told no, but then a second time the bulls came in and said no. "
"3288710","3294170"," Um, so if I'm looking for like a one, two, one, two pump, one, two, three pump in here or"
"3294170","3294750"," something like that."
"3295450","3297530"," Uh, you guys, bears are going to say this is a big giant."
"3297710","3298210"," Who's fair flag. "
"3298310","3298830"," It really isn't."
"3298950","3302550"," 45 and Eastern, so I'm actually expecting the comments from Bank of Canada."
"3302890","3305130"," That was the governor, because of each key. "
"3306110","3307970"," You got the VWAP right here, right?"
"3308410","3309670"," I shouldn't, let me get rid of this line."
"3311010","3312390"," I'm trading off VWAP, right?"
"3312590","3313510"," So that's telling you we're bullish."
"3313730","3314450"," We're trading off pivot. "
"3314690","3315590"," That's telling you we're bullish."
"3316050","3317870"," You're bullish until we meet with real resistance."
"3318550","3319930"," You saw the sellers come in here. "
"3320530","3322970"," You know that the seller is like they just sold right there, right?"
"3323490","3327390"," They're going to attempt to sell this down right here."
"3331530","3333990"," Because one by here, I got the second one right here."
"3334670","3338130"," I'm hoping as a bull that we roll it here one more time. "
"3340530","3342470"," For a quick snap play up and higher."
"3342770","3344130"," This is what I'm looking for."
"3345550","3346630"," We're somewhere in here. "
"3347630","3348930"," Now, do I get that trade?"
"3349650","3350070"," You might not."
"3350270","3353250"," We might just break above, consolidate and start moving higher."
"3354510","3357170"," So I'll be looking for this consolidation to take this trip higher. "
"3358150","3359530"," If I don't, I'm not going to trade it here."
"3359970","3361250"," It's too dangerous to trade right here."
"3361550","3362570"," If you're a bull, I want you to know that. "
"3363230","3364730"," The trade is not right here."
"3365710","3366470"," The trade was right here."
"3367230","3371630"," The trade you're looking for if you're a bull is for consolidation, then take move higher. "
"3372890","3377070"," The other trade you're looking for is a bull is for one more bounce, somewhere down below."
"3378130","3379070"," Then the move higher."
"3382150","3384290"," With the bull bears you're looking for in here. "
"3399400","3400940"," Some sort of rejection, right?"
"3407230","3408290"," Just set this trade up."
"3408790","3410210"," Just like a boiler room."
"3410930","3413350"," It's like the old school boiler rooms back in the day, right?"
"3418860","3420160"," Old trading techniques. "
"3421280","3422780"," Old man trading techniques."
"3424540","3426080"," Look at that beautiful, beautiful."
"3429950","3431570"," So we're looking for right here, right?"
"3431710","3432910"," We're looking for a little bit of consolidation. "
"3433210","3435290"," We're going to talk about it right just inside of here."
"3436170","3437410"," Maybe a quick dip down."
"3437610","3438690"," Then we start blasting a fire. "
"3447160","3448840"," We've got VWAP right down here."
"3449080","3450080"," We've got VWAP down there."
"3451280","3452260"," Quick liquidity grab. "
"3452820","3455800"," Sometimes you'll see liquidity break instead of the grab."
"3455800","3457480"," You'll get like a grab down here, right?"
"3458580","3459260"," Move it higher."
"3461100","3463440"," If you see a failure on this VWAP, right?"
"3463940","3465780"," This is where the bears you'd want to take over. "
"3466340","3467620"," What bears are looking for?"
"3467680","3469220"," A break of this and a hold underneath."
"3469540","3470820"," Then we'll start making a leg lower."
"3474280","3478400"," You don't, with bulls, don't want to see as a break where we just plunge right through right here. "
"3480640","3481880"," It's like, thank you for playing."
"3483720","3485160"," What am I always looking for in here?"
"3485160","3489720"," When we're on Bell, we're on Trend Day or somewhere where it's implied to be a possible Trend Day."
"3490640","3492640"," I'm interested in a call, right?"
"3492860","3493920"," Let's say I'm looking at a zero date. "
"3494160","3495020"," I'm going to be like, okay."
"3495720","3497520"," What are these zero dates starting out at, right?"
"3497940","3503960"," If I'm looking at, let's say I'm looking at 395s down here, and I'm going to watch the price of"
"3503960","3505340"," 395 Cs."
"3505580","3511820"," What they started at, what people are in at, right?"
"3511820","3513380"," What do they price that here?"
"3515060","3516640"," What do they price that here?"
"3517700","3519900"," And then the time of time goes by throughout the day. "
"3520600","3521840"," I'm going to try to jump in."
"3523640","3525320"," I'm going to try to jump in on those calls."
"3525680","3532660"," If you watch the option structure, the change through the day, you'll notice that even if you're in"
"3532660","3535840"," Trend, you're going to notice a fluctuation in price. "
"3538680","3540080"," Over to actually, it's not that way."
"3540100","3541700"," I'm doing that wrong."
"3542140","3546260"," You'll actually see, even if we're going up, you'll see a zero date option. "
"3547080","3548320"," Still go down in value."
"3548320","3549400"," You would have peaks and valleys."
"3552480","3556020"," You'll have a theta burn throughout the entire course of the day, and there'll have to be moments"
"3556020","3559000"," that you can buy that option. "
"3559220","3562780"," This is where all the buyers are in, even though we're going up."
"3567270","3570210"," That's why I get that chain open all day long, just watching it all day long."
"3570210","3573090"," Best times to buy on a Trend Day up or even Trend Day down. "
"3573830","3576790"," This works for bears buying puts and all that kind of stuff, right?"
"3577650","3578850"," And that works in any time frame."
"3579010","3584630"," If you're trying to buy puts, let's say that first initial rollover at 410, you're like buying, I"
"3584630","3588010"," don't know, 400 P's or 410 P's."
"3589230","3591730"," I know when you're in the position that you watch the fluctuation. "
"3591730","3593510"," But three, three percent for December."
"3593830","3595410"," The APS is six, four, nine percent."
"3596450","3599670"," Prior week, according to Freddie Mac and Chinese stock portfolio. "
"3600050","3602870"," See eight, four, five billion dollars of net foreign inflows."
"3603270","3605530"," The largest since December, twenty one."

"3684750","3685890"," Worked itself out right."
"3686210","3687030"," Almost a VWAP. "
"3688630","3691690"," Would you, let me know in chat, would you, would you be bullish or bearish here?"
"3691830","3693590"," I'm interested to know what you, what you would be."

"3724130","3725050"," I'm going to roll this cap."
"3727130","3731350"," If we spent too much time in this moment here and didn't start blasting off, what is it telling"
"3731350","3731630"," you?"
"3732210","3733590"," It's telling you you're going to get a roll."
"3733590","3735630"," I'm just going to tell you it's an intraday trap. "
"3737830","3739850"," CLS productive work here."
"3740090","3741850"," You're not making immediate moves up higher."
"3742650","3744990"," What would you do if you, what's happening right now, right?"
"3745190","3746750"," We're spending a little bit too much time here. "
"3747390","3748910"," What would you do right here if you're a bull?"
"3749650","3750270"," Get into your position."
"3751170","3753630"," You already have the, the break right there, right?"
"3753750","3755310"," So you're going to put some stops somewhere in here."
"3755850","3761250"," So if we do get a roll over what people like to call bull traps, you don't get caught in"
"3761250","3761530"," it, right?"
"3761530","3765270"," You should have grabbed down here and have some stops down here. "
"3765890","3767470"," So you're not upside down in your trade."
"3776010","3784020"," You know what I'm trying to, look, I'm trying to break, quit it here."
"3784200","3786160"," Trying to, trying to stop a bull out. "

"3793040","3795260"," 21, 19 cents on those calls. "
"3799160","3800720"," 88, what was I saying there?"
"3802140","3802540"," 399."
"3804540","3806900"," I was telling you we're not going to 398 today."
"3810700","3812660"," 23.96 is the top of the pricing. "
"3813500","3815220"," They're asking you to buy 86 cent calls."
"3815820","3816280"," They're too expensive."
"3818580","3820220"," I want them for like 30 cents. "
"3826980","3829360"," Like 80, they were 86 cents there a minute ago."
"3829540","3830800"," I wanted them, I want them for like 30."
"3831480","3832500"," So I'm so cheap. "
"3833600","3835640"," I don't want to spend 80 cents on a zero date."
"3836360","3838820"," I want to spend like 30 cents and have it be close to being in the money."
"3840800","3841560"," So terrible. "
"3842680","3843280"," So, so cheap."
"3850850","3853630"," My ball in those though, the 396 is my ball in."
"3853630","3862900"," I'm going to bear rage, sell into it. "
"3867580","3870940"," See the demand on face on a on Facebook on book map."
"3885130","3885930"," I'm still waiting."
"3886050","3887670"," I'm still sitting here waiting to see if I can buy some. "
"3891660","3892860"," It's juicy right here."
"3893740","3894540"," I want to buy."
"3894640","3895080"," I'm so bad. "
"3895820","3896420"," They're very expensive."
"3896800","3897940"," 81 cents a lot of money."
"3899040","3901900"," People out there will tell you what you got to pay for the direction that we're going. "
"3902020","3902400"," I'm like that."
"3902500","3903920"," I don't believe that at all."
"3906080","3908500"," I think it's trying to create you a bit to be a bag holder. "
"3909400","3910740"," I want to buy them cheap."
"3911880","3913040"," I want to have some breathing room."
"3918990","3919950"," Tight stops, baby. "
"3920070","3921150"," Always tight stops down here."
"3921910","3923130"," Always protect your trade."
"3923730","3925470"," You should be picking the right direction every time. "
"3926430","3927770"," Directionally, you should have a bias."
"3928610","3930410"," You should have your plan always in place."
"3932170","3935290"," In the in the in the market should move the way that you think it's going to move. "
"3935510","3935950"," If it starts."
"3936170","3940730"," If your thesis is being broken right out the gate, you got some issues."
"3941890","3942950"," If you're a thesis. "
"3943870","3945830"," So your thesis could be right there."
"3945930","3946830"," We're going up, right?"
"3947390","3948870"," Let's say you're like, Oh, we're going up cap."
"3949270","3950330"," It's right here. "
"3950390","3952090"," We're going up, right?"
"3952330","3953070"," I'm going to buy this."
"3953310","3954210"," I'm going to buy this cap."
"3954210","3958450"," But your thesis could be right and you could be buying this instead, right?"
"3959150","3960930"," And not this stuff down here. "
"3962170","3963050"," That makes sense."
"3964250","3966330"," You're not only there's a thesis need to be right."
"3966450","3969870"," We have to have the correct entry to the trade. "
"3971330","3976570"," You have to have a place to protect in case your thesis fails."
"3977610","3980130"," You don't want to be have a thesis on a trade."
"3980130","3987070"," And then we're breaking through down here or we have a quick liquidity grab and come right back up. "
"3987230","3993170"," But you don't want to have like thesis and then poor execution and then not have an exit strategy."
"3993550","3995170"," Does that make sense to you guys out there?"
"3995790","3998750"," So you have to have all of these things in place."
"4000530","4002610"," You want to be looking at the price of your options. "
"4002870","4004570"," Are they still are they overpriced up here?"
"4005410","4007350"," Can they get a little bit cheaper before I enter?"
"4008070","4011890"," You know pennies work pennies matter right to 10 cents 20 cents."
"4013330","4017230"," Especially if it's high multiple if you're going to get like a high multiple trade hundred two"
"4017230","4018090"," hundred three and four percent."
"4018610","4022250"," That turns in from a 300 percent trade to like a 500 percent trade. "
"4023990","4026850"," So you want to be in your brain."
"4028950","4032990"," Being able to quickly identify a chart quickly think where are the places to buy."
"4034710","4036030"," Where are the failure points?"
"4037370","4041310"," And we're going to cut my losses in case I'm wrong because you're going to be wrong right. "
"4042410","4047970"," Oftentimes you'll see people will be like oh I bought calls here and it started going against me."
"4048630","4052490"," And I was hoping that I would maybe be able to add down here and catch the next trip."
"4052510","4055370"," I was like so is like poor execution poor planning. "
"4055850","4059330"," And then they never actually come back to print anyone that's trapped up here right."
"4059330","4063170"," They bury it down in the clothes and you got torched."
"4063430","4068030"," You go into like the bell and you're like yeah they look great at 90 cents. "
"4070450","4073510"," And like 15 minutes later they're worth 20 cents."
"4074070","4078030"," And you know if I just waited I would have been fine right."
"4078390","4082430"," You could have actually bought 20 cent calls for tomorrow over there. "
"4082910","4087130"," They've done much better so you should you should have this all planned out."
"4087130","4091390"," And you should be able to do it just by looking."
"4092490","4093910"," You should be looking for these setups. "
"4094890","4095729"," You see the setup."
"4096970","4107000"," You should be able to be disciplined enough right disciplined enough to have"
"4107000","4108540"," for your training plan to work out."
"4108760","4111620"," And when it doesn't work out to have a place that you cut your losses. "
"4112880","4117140"," Now you think all this through right here you thought this entire thing through right."
"4117740","4121120"," So you have to then think about well what's my what's my price target on this."
"4123100","4128040"," Right you know that the 50% right here you know that the 78 is somewhere in here. "
"4128680","4132020"," You know that the 100% is right here right you know trend is up."
"4132979","4134520"," You know where your levels are."
"4135160","4136380"," You've already done that in the morning. "
"4138279","4141700"," You have a nice fat arc to appear this would seem we've already hit this once."
"4142840","4146439"," So you're going to start to say well you know we've got some volatility here."
"4146439","4147600"," I'm going to be careful. "
"4147859","4149340"," What I'm going to do is I'm going to take my stops."
"4149340","4150319"," I'm going to raise them up."
"4151960","4154479"," So get my stops that were down here right. "
"4155200","4156680"," I'm going to watch the options chain."
"4157160","4160880"," You're going to know that the options chain those calls were 81 cents."
"4161540","4162939"," They're now 99 cents. "
"4163760","4165779"," Maybe you come to 90 cents on stops."
"4167040","4169939"," You'll usually see a fluctuation 10 cents or so."
"4170700","4172060"," Every 10 cents you can move them up. "
"4173160","4174500"," You can do this SPX."
"4175340","4176640"," It's all relates to SPX."
"4176859","4178080"," It's all relates to futures. "
"4181779","4184359"," All right you're just going to keep moving it up moving it up."
"4184600","4188920"," You're going to know where your resistance places the resistance are."
"4191800","4194000"," Points of interest in previous time frames. "
"4195360","4197140"," This is a previous low back up here."
"4202780","4204760"," You might say oh you know what I'm going to do cap."
"4204760","4207580"," I'm going to put on 10 contracts. "
"4207840","4209160"," I'm going to take off five over here."
"4209380","4210960"," I'm going to take three off over here."
"4211420","4212680"," Take five off over here. "
"4214760","4218200"," Let two or three just in case they want to go up here to three 98."
"4219640","4221080"," In case I'm getting really bullish."
"4225110","4225910"," Does that make sense?"
"4228390","4230590"," If you can't do that as a trader. "
"4232010","4233750"," On any time frame three month."
"4234550","4235250"," One month."
"4236250","4236490"," Weekly. "
"4237450","4237590"," Daily."
"4238130","4238490"," Doesn't matter."
"4239350","4243530"," You can't do this as a trader and figure this out in your head real quick. "
"4243850","4244550"," It's really fast."
"4245690","4247470"," You shouldn't be trading with real money."
"4249730","4252150"," I would recommend to you not to trade with real money. "
"4253450","4257770"," If you can't figure out in your head directional moves in the market."
"4257770","4261850"," You can be wrong and then having a tight plan."
"4263630","4267190"," I'll tell you what if this was a if this was a move that was a weekly or a monthly"
"4267190","4270590"," move and you you plotted this all right and you got it where you're doing it. "
"4271210","4273130"," You're going to feel a hell of a lot better."
"4274730","4276590"," Having entered here here here."
"4278890","4280110"," Confidence in your trade. "
"4281530","4282530"," Then if you're like."
"4284330","4285610"," Well, I bought it right here."
"4285690","4286690"," We started rolling over. "
"4287050","4291910"," I was upside down for three weeks until my last minute my position printed."
"4292330","4293950"," You can put this upside down same thing."
"4295510","4297490"," It doesn't matter if it's bullish or bearish bets. "
"4298390","4300190"," You always want to be like confident that trade."
"4300530","4300910"," It's looking good."
"4301070","4301450"," It's looking good. "
"4302090","4302970"," Ruled over a little bit."
"4303090","4303950"," I'm not too afraid here."
"4304830","4306130"," Still not too afraid here. "
"4306250","4307370"," Still not too afraid here."
"4310930","4314030"," I can actually have a trend break."
"4316610","4320250"," We're so high now on this trend that we could break down a little bit more than usual. "
"4321070","4322070"," I'm still good to go."
"4326360","4328620"," When you're in a trade like that, it feels good, doesn't it?"
"4329920","4334200"," It feels good, right?"
"4334420","4339980"," You don't want to ever be in a trade that's not automatically immediately going in your favor."
"4342100","4348000"," You always want to be a trade that's not always, well, 70% of the time, 90% of the"
"4348000","4348160"," time. "
"4348320","4349860"," That's what your aim is."
"4350020","4353300"," Your aim is like 70%, 90% of the time."
"4354040","4360470"," You're starting your trade going in the direction you want it. "
"4360550","4363990"," If you're not doing that, that's time on the screen, right?"
"4364170","4364970"," That's time in market."
"4365270","4367450"," That's watching every single day."
"4368990","4372150"," That's not going to bed at nighttime and it's doing reading books, right?"
"4372370","4374790"," That's talking to people on social media that you trust, right?"
"4381210","4382650"," It feels good, right?"
"4385090","4386090"," It does. "
"4386330","4386950"," I know."
"4387290","4391950"," So I know for a good five years, three to five years."
"4393390","4395130"," I was never confident in my positions. "
"4397230","4399050"," Sometimes positions would go my way."
"4399050","4401070"," Oftentimes they didn't and I didn't know why."
"4403500","4405920"," It wasn't taking notes as to why they were going wrong. "
"4405920","4408460"," It wasn't going back in time to find out why they were wrong."
"4409400","4412940"," It wasn't looking at the mechanics of why my trades were always fucked up."
"4413420","4415080"," I shouldn't say that word, but they were, right?"
"4415660","4418540"," Taking fucked up trades right out the gate. "
"4421760","4426440"," I don't remember specifically, but I can remember that."
"4428020","4431860"," I can remember when I was first trading, I was like, all right."
"4432020","4432720"," No, I can remember going. "
"4432880","4436480"," I can't believe some of the trades that I had gotten into and had zero."
"4438640","4439320"," Market awareness."
"4442300","4443900"," Why should have taken those trades?"
"4446520","4455430"," It only feels good to hear smashing and bashing hell. "
"4455590","4455730"," Yeah."
"4456390","4457070"," You're right, Brad."
"4466610","4469090"," Yeah, so that was the iron condor that I posted. "
"4469490","4478950"," You need to be setting those iron condors up for, um, yeah, we've been stuck here."
"4480890","4481310"," Absolutely."
"4481650","4482250"," This is a major. "
"4482670","4484450"," We could look at the market profile."
"4485010","4485390"," There's that."
"4487390","4489370"," It's not going to be easy to break through here. "
"4489430","4489990"," You're going to wait."
"4490130","4494330"," I think we're breaking through here going lower, but it's going to take a lot to break through"
"4494330","4494550"," here."
"4497330","4498410"," It's not going to be easy. "
"4500270","4502210"," Below is like a chasm."
"4511260","4513100"," I'm not tracking everything you guys are saying."
"4513920","4514920"," I'm missing some of the conversation. "
"4515360","4518420"," I haven't been looking at the chat as much as I usually do this morning."
"4518840","4524740"," Let me go through the chat real quick and see what I'm saying."
"4525420","4526020"," Morning, Tommy. "
"4526280","4526680"," How are you, brother?"
"4527920","4529140"," Time to take a good to see you."
"4529920","4531320"," Please like and subscribe these videos."
"4532440","4534260"," I appreciate the likes and subscribes. "
"4534320","4535940"," It helps them with the videos get traction."
"4537240","4539060"," If everyone's bullish, you got to go bearish."
"4541200","4541800"," Nobody's bullish. "
"4542200","4545940"," Let's go through some of the chat real quick."
"4546320","4550660"," If everyone's bullish, they got to go bearish."
"4550780","4551820"," Everyone's bearish right now. "
"4553420","4554420"," I want to talk to you guys."
"4554540","4555400"," Let's talk about that real quick."
"4556040","4557740"," I saw some. "
"4558740","4560140"," Emerson was saying no."
"4560320","4561460"," I was saying the Mexico."
"4561760","4564840"," I pick plus oil quarter of 1.753 million. "
"4565080","4566620"," Brows per day until December."
"4567520","4568080"," 2023."
"4569320","4572460"," That is again, makes those Mexico's. "
"4572760","4573920"," I pick plus oil quarter."
"4574620","4578180"," Is of 1.75. Three million."
"4578340","4579520"," Brows per day until December. "
"4579760","4580380"," Twenty three."
"4581000","4584300"," So Emerson was saying Emerson was saying something a couple days ago about."
"4584300","4586300"," Bulls are not hedged. "
"4587700","4589440"," And until they become hedged."
"4589980","4592000"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"4592320","4593780"," There's complacency in the market. "
"4593820","4598460"," The banachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"4599360","4605500"," I think oftentimes when when you guys hear statements like that, you understand it, but you don't"
"4605500","4605720"," bully."
"4606120","4606620"," Some of you do."
"4606740","4607320"," Some of you don't. "
"4607500","4609440"," I think a long time mark participants."
"4610240","4611440"," Very intelligent mark participants."
"4611440","4612940"," Like smart guys. "
"4613760","4614600"," Not me."
"4615420","4616500"," I try to trade dumb."
"4620740","4623840"," I think I think that the when you see those. "
"4625760","4626880"," I think tight here."
"4628900","4630200"," When you see those comments."
"4630620","4632520"," I often. "
"4638590","4644290"," I often think that a new trader or terrorism is that concept might think that."
"4645130","4646770"," Bulls are trapped up here."
"4648690","4651730"," In their complacent and they're going to get destroyed down here. "
"4653310","4654610"," That's not what it is."
"4655010","4655290"," There's."
"4656530","4658010"," The bulls got in down here. "
"4658090","4659190"," You can see where they got in."
"4662100","4664080"," We were trending up in a channel."
"4665180","4665220"," Right. "
"4667000","4669500"," Bulls are looking for a break of channel."
"4671740","4673180"," Rejection in a move lower."
"4674100","4676020"," Now if you're along from down here. "
"4676740","4678880"," You would start to liquidate."
"4679420","4679440"," Right."
"4679760","4684320"," You'd start to sell out of your position because you've had a break and you're going to as a bull. "
"4684860","4687520"," You're not going to be looking for a place to rebuy the market."
"4689740","4693180"," So there's no like that's where the complacency really is."
"4695200","4697380"," And symbols are still in the market. "
"4697740","4698460"," They haven't sold."
"4699680","4701440"," But their complacency is actually down here."
"4703040","4703960"," It's not up here. "
"4705260","4706140"," It's down here."
"4707160","4708900"," So when Emerson makes a statement like that."
"4710720","4714380"," The point that they're trying to make is that the ones that are still long down here. "
"4715180","4719700"," You need the breakdown here and then you need the break of this level with no hedging."
"4720300","4720820"," Does that make sense?"
"4721600","4725440"," This is where you would trap some market participants down below here."
"4726140","4726680"," Does that make sense?"
"4726680","4728640"," It's a much larger time frame. "
"4729020","4733780"," And there's other time frames going back way, way, way, way, way farther in time."
"4734180","4739900"," When you're looking at the historical prices of the spy going I think right now or close to 2020,"
"4739900","4741380"," 2001 somewhere in there."
"4741640","4748000"," There's other market buyers that are there long from much farther back in time. "
"4748260","4748320"," Right."
"4749080","4751780"," That's where the real complacency talk comes in."
"4752530","4756740"," And then you'll see the waterfall hedging over here. "
"4757180","4760740"," This is where the bears would get help going down the market going down."
"4761400","4762620"," That's where you see acceleration."
"4763880","4769840"," Like you get help from dealers that are trying to become neutral against market participants. "
"4770060","4773540"," You're not going to see the aggressive selling until you break through here."
"4773540","4781020"," You'll get help from market participants or market equity owners."
"4781300","4781320"," Right. "
"4781420","4784840"," If you're like a long time spy holder or something like that, you go on millions and millions and"
"4784840","4785540"," millions of dollars."
"4786100","4790240"," If you're looking for acceleration and selling, you're going to see it below here."
"4790680","4790880"," Okay. "
"4790940","4791400"," Not right here."
"4791600","4792880"," This has nothing to do with it."
"4800030","4801610"," And so are we bullish here?"
"4801790","4801850"," No. "
"4801990","4803370"," We put on our bear hat over here."
"4804830","4805230"," Right."
"4805230","4807990"," We want to trade this down until we find real demand. "
"4808630","4810890"," We know where real demand is currently, right?"
"4812270","4813210"," It's down here."
"4815710","4816190"," Right."
"4816210","4817330"," We know where the real demand is. "
"4820430","4823890"," We know we've got this target down here of S3, right?"
"4824410","4825150"," 382, right?"
"4826430","4826770"," Zero."
"4829570","4830570"," All kind of lines up, right?"
"4833760","4835160"," You've got an air gap down here."
"4838700","4843140"," You know if you're a bear and you're going to put a bear trade, you're going to try to take"
"4843140","4844760"," some profit once we hit here, right?"
"4845900","4848360"," You know we're going to grind through here, right?"
"4849860","4852680"," But you know that this is Valhalla if you're a bear. "
"4854300","4854660"," Right."
"4855780","4858320"," I think I'll have to check back in the history."
"4858480","4861440"," I haven't looked in the past couple of weeks, but you guys get what I'm saying?"
"4871120","4872300"," Quick liquidity grab. "
"4874300","4876760"," Still have my eyes on those three ninety sixes."
"4877060","4877780"," Haven't bought them yet."
"4878000","4879340"," I told you they were eighty nine cents. "
"4880060","4885160"," So just a reminder for later on at one p.m. They're now 68 cents."
"4885280","4888620"," One p.m. At least in time we get his piece of the card."
"4889200","4894800"," Speaking just to note, it is a prerecorded welcome address by the card at the sixth annual"
"4894800","4901260"," conference of the Europeans as systemic risk for addressing financial stability challenges. "
"4905420","4908660"," Not seeing productive consolidation."
"4908660","4911460"," This consolidation should take the purchase description there."
"4911560","4919560"," So just for the card later on attending the preopening of the exhibition of Rosemary Chocolate"
"4919560","4921680"," Museum, the modern concept. "
"4928280","4930460"," Start to see extended consolidation."
"4931040","4933180"," It starts to look more like distribution, right?"
"4933920","4938080"," Might get a bounce by here, but this I don't want I don't ever like seeing this much consolidation."
"4938100","4945260"," I always like to see like a little bit of this down move start moving higher. "
"4945800","4947640"," Start seeing this kind of stuff right here."
"4947640","4950580"," Maybe we should start looking for some lows down here."
"4952020","4955380"," I don't think we get it, but if we do, if I can get a nice cheap call down here. "
"4955980","4956200"," I will."
"4962240","4963000"," Hold on here."
"4963780","4965140"," They're back to eighty two cents again. "
"4965260","4966160"," They're sixty seven cents."
"4966180","4966760"," I should have bought them."
"4967320","4968260"," I'm so greedy. "
"4975820","4977720"," Maybe I should have bought sixty seven cents."
"4978160","4979020"," They've been being too greedy."
"4982440","4983720"," That's actually not a bad price tag. "
"4983920","4984660"," Sixty seven cents."
"4984920","4985900"," Kind of like cutting the difference, right?"
"4985900","4986980"," I want them at thirty."
"4987600","4990980"," They came down to sixty for a minute and it tees me into buying them. "
"4994060","4997940"," And I'm like, I want them at thirty thirty four thirty four cents somewhere in there."
"5004480","5006460"," Yesterday they cost forty."
"5007060","5007660"," No, thirty cents. "
"5008740","5011220"," They were thirty one or thirty two cents at one point."
"5011340","5012420"," I took a glance at them."
"5013100","5014140"," Three ninety sixes. "
"5015340","5015820"," Somewhere."
"5017660","5018200"," Somewhere somewhere."
"5018200","5018460"," Somewhere. "
"5019020","5020760"," I'm looking at two different screeners."
"5021220","5022900"," I think they were like thirty cents down in here."
"5026280","5028100"," The whole note could quite well overall. "
"5031860","5035740"," Sir, a minor in about twenty minutes time."
"5036220","5038000"," We are expecting comments from Bank"
"5038000","5048200"," of"
"5048200","5048200"," Canada's deputy."
"5048200","5048800"," Bottom of the hour. "
"5048960","5049420"," What time is that?"
"5050200","5050920"," Six minutes."
"5054900","5056380"," Got some volatility coming in."
"5059480","5060620"," Some euro volatility. "
"5075650","5077370"," Man, I want to buy that bad right there."
"5081030","5082210"," I'm just going to sit on my hands."
"5082770","5083190"," I'm just going to relax. "
"5084290","5084950"," I'm just going to chill."
"5087170","5087990"," Ease up here."
"5091850","5093210"," I'm just going to chill here for a minute. "
"5093350","5094510"," Sit on my hands and just wait."
"5095390","5096710"," I'm just going to tell myself."
"5096830","5099010"," Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience. "
"5100370","5103710"," Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience, patience, patience, patience."
"5111650","5112950"," A little bit of patience."
"5121800","5127600"," I'd rather sit here and make one great trade than ten bad trades in a day, right?"
"5134260","5136800"," 71 cents, 72 cents, somewhere in there. "
"5137240","5138200"," Just give me that quick grip down."
"5138320","5139020"," Give me that 30."
"5139300","5140380"," 30 cent liquidity grab. "
"5142420","5143260"," That's all I want."
"5143440","5144260"," Like 34 cent calls."
"5147820","5152020"," I'd rather burn three sets of 30 cent calls than one set of 90 cent calls. "
"5152760","5157080"," It will also be posting out the video for Bank of Canada's deputy, Governor Kuzichki."
"5157820","5159160"," Kuzichki's newsfeed for you."
"5159380","5162420"," Remember, it takes us to be released in about four minutes time. "

"5799340","5801580"," Yeah, these levels are pretty good, aren't they, Garrett?"
"5802240","5804040"," They're pretty good levels. "
"5804040","5806080"," They trade out very well."
"5808520","5813860"," So we've also posted out the speech from Bank of Canada's Deputy Governor, because it's key on the"
"5813860","5814860"," flash of his news feed."
"5815040","5818660"," Peter, you guys should always have a plan. "
"5819040","5820560"," You guys should always have an exit strategy."
"5821500","5825960"," Sometimes, you know, sometimes you'll get stopped out on a liquidity grab down below or above."
"5827880","5832880"," But rather, you know, I'd rather get stopped out on the liquidity grab and then maybe catch the"
"5832880","5833780"," move later later. "
"5833780","5838260"," So, like, let's say, so you come down here, you make a plan, right?"
"5838380","5840300"," You get stopped out, but then we start moving higher."
"5841220","5844440"," You can always jump in on the second third for that one part of the trade."
"5845420","5850540"," I'd rather get stopped out of a trade, though, than ever be staying in the trade as we had lower,"
"5850960","5852560"," something like that, and just getting wrecked. "
"5853040","5857900"," This is usually where people lose their money is in not having stops."
"5859080","5865460"," Sometimes, people say you can die of 1,000 little cuts with two tight of stops."
"5866580","5872040"," But I don't usually do this tight of stops when we're in negative gamma. "
"5872740","5878160"," The trade really can go against you really fast because they're selling into strength, right?"
"5878380","5879360"," We know we're in negative gamma."
"5879820","5881540"," We know they're going to try to short every single rip."
"5883360","5889980"," So, there is real risk buying calls in the negative gamma environment. "
"5890180","5897740"," You should be putting on put spreads in a negative gamma environment, put spreads or some kind of a"
"5897740","5901540"," crash protection, something while we're here."
"5902820","5904320"," They keep that separate from your day trading."
"5905600","5910430"," I think my daughter was calling for me. "
"5913850","5914910"," What else are you guys saying?"
"5915430","5917890"," Again, do you guys want to take a look around the market real quick?"
"5919750","5921090"," Let's take a look around the market real quick."
"5923870","5926530"," I'm in a trade right now, so I want to be careful."
"5927910","5929450"," I want to be careful here while I'm in a trade. "
"5930510","5930710"," Okay."
"5931690","5933390"," I'm going to set some more."
"5933450","5949680"," I didn't set stops in this trade, so I need to do this"
"5949680","5950200"," a second here. "
"5951080","5951440"," Okay."
"5954540","5956440"," So, we'll get the spy, right?"
"5957200","5967520"," It doesn't matter if you're, so if you're, if you're trading, if you're trading Tesla, Apple,"
"5967900","5975180"," any of the S&P 500 companies, you should be doing this when you're throughout your day."
"5975400","5976620"," You should be checking the market. "
"5977480","5982860"," If you're just trading the S&P 500, sometimes it's going to be checking sectors within the S&P 500,"
"5982860","5986400"," XLE, XLU, the sector rotations that are going on."
"5986660","5990580"," We said yesterday the next decent short should be at XLU, right?"
"5991220","5992140"," We'll take a look there first."
"5992380","5993000"," We'll go to XLU. "
"5996340","5998100"," So, the last of the bulls are hiding, right?"
"5999400","6003700"," You see they're hiding in here."
"6004420","6005660"," Let me see if I can mute this stuff."
"6014580","6016380"," All right, you kind of want to see this. "
"6016500","6018980"," This would be the next really juicy, believe it or not."
"6020680","6026060"," Sold it down off 72, looking for more supply to come down to these levels down in here, right?"
"6026920","6029520"," Start, this is only 11-17 right here."
"6032390","6033350"," Let me look at this down here. "
"6034770","6035170"," Juicy."
"6037050","6038870"," Juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, short."
"6038870","6044510"," If you're going to short a sector or start building a position in the sector, it's probably the"
"6044510","6044750"," one. "
"6046910","6048730"," It's probably where you want to go."
"6049350","6050390"," It's probably the spy, right?"
"6050990","6052670"," And we'll start looking around the market."
"6052870","6054690"," We're going to look at, we can look at the VIX first. "
"6069350","6070690"," Start extending this stuff out."
"6071610","6072730"," Let's see what happened down here."
"6072870","6075770"," We have some demand came in, right?"
"6076370","6078370"," The sellers came back down, told you no. "
"6079130","6080490"," Came back down to check again."
"6082430","6084730"," The man said no, way is up, not down."
"6086950","6088850"," So, bears are going to try to get constructive here. "
"6089010","6091010"," They've broken above these sellers down below."
"6091770","6094990"," This is bearish on the market, right?"
"6095270","6096310"," You want to get higher here?"
"6096430","6097250"," You're not seeing the sellers."
"6097690","6101850"," You're not seeing the sellers are weak here, you'd say, right?"
"6101850","6103970"," And so, we're going to be looking at tag above here. "
"6106010","6108070"," Probably the risk of the market rolling over here."
"6109450","6111530"," I wonder if I'm going to get stopped out of my trade here."
"6111790","6112110"," Probably. "
"6113450","6115590"," It's probably going to get stopped out here in a minute."
"6117630","6120070"," There's a fair chance for what the VIX looks like."
"6120970","6122010"," You can see it right here. "
"6125040","6126300"," Probably going to roll the market over."
"6126980","6129080"," So, you saw the sellers come in, right?"
"6130800","6133600"," See right now, the sellers are weak here, right?"
"6134640","6137920"," So, the sellers are going to move into another level, right?"
"6138180","6138520"," Higher level."
"6139060","6141780"," More than likely going to see the VIX to try to make a run up higher. "
"6142100","6143160"," You see a little roll on the market."
"6143680","6145360"," Probably roll it down to the point of control again."
"6147680","6150500"," And we'll look at Dixie. "
"6154960","6157980"," And you can see that the buyer is down here, right?"
"6158660","6159840"," Fire is down here."
"6160640","6162120"," Fire is down here, right?"
"6163660","6164860"," Fire is right here."
"6165340","6166720"," Well, I got to clean all this up. "
"6167460","6168060"," Fire is here."
"6168220","6168740"," Fire is here."
"6169140","6169960"," Fire is here. "
"6170140","6170680"," Fire is here."
"6171560","6173220"," Nice little flag growing right here."
"6174500","6178560"," At least temporary weakness for a move higher, right?"
"6179540","6180440"," At least temporary weakness. "
"6180840","6181960"," This could roll over, too."
"6183080","6186760"," But you want to, this is a good for a bearish trade inequities."
"6186760","6192920"," This looks healthy to me for a bearish trade inequities, at least in the short time period right"
"6192920","6193160"," here. "
"6194440","6195940"," I'd expect this to come up."
"6196620","6196860"," Dixie."
"6198740","6200800"," Let's see if the bond market is telling us anything. "
"6204520","6205940"," Especially like shitty bonds."
"6211750","6215030"," Well, I'll tell you what."
"6217050","6218890"," There's just coming in here, right?"
"6220610","6221690"," Selling it down. "
"6222390","6223590"," Selling it down."
"6224390","6225410"," Selling it down."
"6228450","6230770"," Bulls are expecting us to come up here first. "
"6231150","6234110"," Smart equity bubbles are saying, let's go up here and then we'll sell it down."
"6235650","6236850"," Bears saying, nope."
"6237190","6240030"," We're coming straight in on this trend line. "
"6240190","6242150"," We're going to try to push this back down and close this gap."
"6243210","6246690"," So I don't really like, I don't dislike or like HYG right now."
"6247710","6249350"," I'm open to the trade lower here. "
"6250590","6257250"," I'm open for bulls to look for better, a better trade on this trend."
"6257570","6259070"," Big power move up, big power move up."
"6260150","6262230"," Maybe some kind of move down, then move higher. "
"6265390","6266210"," I like that idea better."
"6269610","6271530"," Where we at, HYG right now, J and K."
"6277020","6278960"," Start adjusting our charts there, don't we?"
"6284000","6285080"," Bond market, man."
"6285300","6286200"," Bond market's telling you. "
"6286500","6294110"," I'll tell you what, Bond market's disagreeing with the bond markets totally disagree, especially"
"6294110","6294890"," high risk stuff."
"6296610","6306160"," I guess there's a little bit of, if you want a constructive down move in the market, if you're a"
"6306160","6320720"," bear, equity bear, you want to be seeing, if you"

"6324120","6325280"," Some key levels for you. "
"6325340","6332780"," Close the gap at 91.20. If you want to get really nasty in the market, you got this move"
"6332780","6334020"," and then this move down here."
"6335700","6340340"," I'm sure bears are saying that you want to see this constructiveness."
"6350170","6351710"," There is big buyers in here. "
"6351710","6359610"," I mean, if you're, it's buyers here, but they're from way lower there."
"6360910","6362710"," They bought this like it was nothing."
"6365070","6372340"," So maybe some temporary weakness here, right in here somewhere. "
"6377620","6384860"," TLT doing that TLT is just plowing ahead."
"6385820","6387520"," Look at TLT."
"6393780","6403140"," TLT slammed on 109.67. Any of you guys still in that long TLT trade or?"
"6404640","6407180"," You guys starting to take some off the top here or what?"
"6408480","6409740"," I don't know if you get that. "
"6411620","6417660"," You could probably hope for a, it might be a buyer down here somewhere."
"6423340","6425120"," It's a pretty giant trade, isn't it?"
"6426820","6428900"," Look at that, just monster moving it."
"6434420","6435620"," That's great trade. "
"6436240","6437880"," You don't have to stain it though."
"6440440","6443840"," It's pretty wild trade here."
"6449140","6450500"," It's a tough call here. "
"6452640","6455240"," Let me blast through these real quick."
"6458220","6460240"," That monster moves on boil."
"6461640","6463160"," Monster moves on boil. "
"6466930","6476840"," Yeah, temporary weakness in the market probably probably coming up"
"6476840","6477300"," right now."
"6483420","6485440"," Just grinding down right here."
"6485780","6486880"," Distribution showing up. "
"6493270","6494130"," It's kind of weird."
"6494330","6496610"," My calls are holding value right now."
"6499250","6502930"," Even though we've got distribution showing it's ugly, raring it's ugly head right now. "
"6503130","6504290"," I haven't stopped out or anything."
"6504790","6509390"," According to a source TC energy declared force measure over keystone pipeline outage."
"6511730","6513130"," I haven't triggered a stop. "
"6513630","6514810"," I'm kind of surprised at that."
"6516410","6524750"," I was just a repeat of an earlier headline."
"6532400","6534140"," Tough read on the market. "
"6534260","6535320"," Tough read without a doubt."
"6538660","6540260"," I'm going to leave that at uncertain."
"6541640","6542660"," He leaves uncertain. "
"6544100","6546860"," Let me see what else you guys are saying."
"6548680","6549640"," Tough call here."
"6550380","6552160"," Somebody's asking is this liquidity graph?"
"6552340","6552800"," We're heading lower. "
"6553000","6553420"," I don't know."
"6554220","6556120"," My calls are holding up right now."
"6556120","6557380"," I'm scratching my head on this one. "
"6558900","6562020"," My calls should be like 30 cents right now."
"6562020","6562700"," They're at 56."
"6563200","6563780"," 60 cents. "
"6564400","6566960"," There's a premium kick coming in the market right now just so you know."
"6569380","6571120"," My calls are 61 cents."
"6571800","6573780"," So they were up here. "
"6573920","6575920"," They were 61 cents and 50 cents."
"6575920","6579400"," And we're way down here and there's still 50."
"6579520","6580080"," 60 cents. "
"6580740","6581960"," So I don't say to you."
"6582280","6584740"," I know what I can say to you."
"6586660","6588240"," Mixed bag across the market. "
"6589100","6593640"," Vix is, you know, there's some some weakness showing in the market."
"6593640","6593720"," Okay."
"6594420","6600860"," Is expected to attend the preopening of the expectation of the Rose and Marie Trockler Museum for"
"6600860","6602640"," more than constant rank foot. "
"6603120","6605420"," And no text is to be expected."
"6606680","6608540"," But of course, we'll keep our eyes out for it."
"6609320","6612940"," If you're a bully or hoping that dealers are working in your favor right now. "
"6616140","6619060"," Yeah, there's 68 cents now, 69 cents."
"6632680","6635460"," Hard, hard read looking around that usually we can get a good read."
"6635780","6639680"," That's not like I wasn't able to get a good read from whatever I was looking at. "
"6640240","6644560"," Their bonds were telling you a different story than the equity market equity records telling you"
"6644560","6647680"," we're going to roll over bond markets telling you we ain't rolling over."
"6650700","6653160"," There is also some interplay with TLT."
"6653600","6656620"," It'd be nice to see like TLT roll over slightly. "
"6657800","6661960"," Watch a twig and J&K kind of start blasting off."
"6665640","6667780"," I try to look towards the bond market."
"6668000","6669740"," Well, we talk about that all the time, right?"
"6669980","6672720"," You want to see divergence in price on spy versus. "
"6673080","6675840"," To meet with federal prosecutors in New York."
"6676640","6677360"," That's a FTS."
"6677820","6681280"," So FTS CEO John Ray attended meeting in Manhattan this week. "
"6682090","6687800"," And Manhattan prosecutors are leading lead on justice probe of FTS is collapse."
"6690320","6692700"," You want to see divergence in the bond market?"
"6693280","6694280"," That's both ways."

"6723360","6724800"," Usually you can get a lead."
"6727360","6728500"," From bonds."
"6729520","6731640"," And you need either direction. "
"6732040","6735260"," You see that divergence and especially high risk bonds."
"6737560","6740920"," If there's divergence on those prices versus equity prices."
"6741520","6742140"," Not always. "
"6742240","6743120"," Doesn't always work."
"6744780","6747480"," You know, well, we just say famously right."
"6749000","6751040"," TLT went to the depths of hell bond. "
"6751220","6753680"," The bond market went to the depths of hell in the equity market."
"6754260","6755860"," Didn't quite follow along with it."
"6755860","6756600"," A large timeframe. "
"6756820","6757060"," Right."
"6757740","6759440"," You guys remember that last year this year."
"6761180","6763980"," Equity prices fell with it, but not like bonds did. "
"6765340","6766380"," It's a larger timeframe."
"6766800","6770320"," We haven't seen that bloodbath yet in the equity market."
"6774110","6776090"," So bonds will tell you before it happens, right?"
"6776330","6778850"," And a large timeframe bonds are telling you that equities are going to crash. "
"6782850","6786510"," On a small time frame, like in a day, you can probably look at H Y G."
"6787030","6791690"," And if you see H Y G and J and K going down and the market is up."
"6793270","6796390"," You could probably buy zero day puts into the close."
"6797490","6800170"," And you'll see that reflected the following day with a bloodbath. "
"6801710","6802190"," Inequities."
"6803570","6805310"," We had the reverse of that yesterday."
"6810350","6814050"," Give some strength and some high risk stuff. "
"6817030","6817750"," Right now."
"6825180","6826260"," Hey, and we can get more."
"6826360","6826760"," How are you brother?"
"6826760","6828020"," I didn't see in the chat. "
"6828620","6829260"," Good to see you."
"6829800","6831280"," Good to trim your region today."
"6831480","6832040"," I said about it. "
"6832160","6834300"," Owned it from 434 to 780."
"6834660","6835040"," Yeah, that's."
"6836220","6841260"," There were some GME traders that came in yesterday, like long term GME traders. "
"6842340","6848220"," And they were noting the significance of, I believe it was $21 and we had a small discussion about"
"6848220","6848420"," it."
"6848880","6850260"," That was the first rip."
"6851480","6852660"," That was the first trip. "
"6852800","6856240"," I think that was in December or January when they wound the first time."
"6856240","6857960"," It actually blasted off like 20 bucks."
"6858980","6862380"," The weird part was I didn't say this yesterday, but it should have. "
"6862540","6867580"," Back then when it hit 20, it is like 21 or 23 or something."
"6868780","6871520"," Wall Street bats actually jumped on the trade and it rolled back down."
"6872200","6875420"," And then people were kind of trapped, right?"
"6876380","6878100"," That was like the first trap, I think. "
"6878420","6879380"," A February call correctly."
"6880360","6887190"," So yeah, I understand that's got to be a word feeling right when you're not even a weird feeling."
"6887190","6889090"," It's like kind of sucks when you see that. "
"6890870","6892630"," It's like 780 down to 434."
"6894210","6896270"," Or at 434, I'll wait at 780."
"6896930","6897890"," And you're like, see you later. "
"6901650","6902770"," They're not going to."
"6907020","6909760"," Yes, Buy Book Map has a Monster Limit Order at 397."
"6911820","6912680"," Yes, they do. "
"6921910","6922850"," Yeah, I don't see."
"6923230","6924170"," Are you looking at Inspire?"
"6924370","6924510"," Yes."
"6940820","6943040"," Is that where you're talking about 3975?"
"6944340","6946420"," Is that the Monster Order that you're talking about?"
"6946980","6950980"," Or are you looking on the book maps equity version, equity data?"
"6956060","6960700"," Nice, calls are up to 72 cents right now, because you're doing okay right now. "
"6961120","6962560"," Reclaim to VWAPT currently."
"6967020","6971900"," I'm going to move some stops up here."
"6971900","6975240"," 45 cents and we're up to 70 cents now. "
"6976260","6978540"," I'm going to move up to 60 cents."
"6983480","6984380"," See how this goes?"
"6989040","6990760"," Monster Limit Order at 397."
"6991340","6992660"," I thought you weren't talking take up. "
"6992780","6993200"," Yeah, I know."
"6993860","6996040"," I keep saying I'm going to take a day off and I have."
"6996280","6999140"," I was so my wife this morning. "
"7000560","7002280"," We tell you how good she is, okay?"
"7002280","7007480"," I told my wife, I was like, I got to stay up for a future tonight."
"7007880","7009200"," I'm like, I got to stay up and have a choice."
"7009600","7014140"," So this is like a few months of Lee in the past two weeks or so. "
"7014380","7017600"," Last week, I think I had two or three nights where I was up all night long."
"7019220","7021480"," And then this week I've had three nights."
"7022860","7026480"," One night I was drinking, but I shouldn't have done that, but. "
"7027860","7031100"," They've had three nights of course day training with you guys here."
"7031740","7034860"," Is to travel to London on seven nights tomorrow."
"7036000","7037120"," I'm afraid of them. "
"7037360","7039700"," I have a healthy fear of."
"7040740","7045640"," I'm not like full on market crash, but I'm, you know, I forget the bear stance on."
"7045640","7050940"," So I have a heightened awareness that they could throw the market out or destroy the market in the"
"7050940","7051280"," overnight. "
"7052280","7056300"," So there's been some key moments in the market where I'm like, I have to stay awake until one o "
"7056300","7057540","'clock, three o'clock in the morning."
"7058160","7059220"," Try to sleep in."
"7059400","7062000"," I've been going horse from talking so much. "
"7062240","7063460"," My vocal cords are hurt."
"7063820","7066420"," So I told my wife I would take yesterday off."
"7066840","7067240"," I didn't. "
"7067360","7067920"," She doesn't know how."
"7068160","7069220"," She doesn't know like all that."
"7069780","7072200"," That should be putting the stream up in the morning and stuff like that. "
"7072920","7079320"," And so this morning she turned my alarm off and was going to try to let me sleep."
"7081180","7084400"," So I woke up this morning and I go, what's going on?"
"7087140","7091040"," I'm like, I'm like, even though I say I'm going to take the day off, doesn't mean I'm taking the"
"7091040","7091460"," day off."
"7092760","7093740"," So she loves me. "
"7097500","7100160"," So although I was upset, I'm still happy."
"7105000","7105660"," I love her."
"7112010","7113010"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"7114970","7118370"," I think she doesn't want me to hurt my vocal cords."
"7118510","7119550"," So I get it."
"7120770","7125670"," According to the U.S. State Department, U.S. representative for North Korea spoke with China's"
"7125670","7128730"," representative on Korean and Instagram affairs on Wednesday. "
"7131570","7133490"," So that's what's going on in the background."
"7135410","7136610"," Yeah, you got to stay."
"7136710","7143710"," So moments like this, like you'll get I'm not holding overnight moves or if I'm not trying to"
"7143710","7144790"," capitalize on. "
"7144790","7146690"," I'm expecting comments from ECB's president."
"7146830","7152650"," You know, as a prime example, we had a conversation about Tesla, right?"
"7152790","7157570"," The other day, and I said to you, if you ever see Tesla, let's say you said let's say you're"
"7157570","7158070"," a Tesla bull."
"7159210","7164850"," We might not go down to 135, 150, 90 dollars, but you were pre-planning, right?"
"7165190","7166510"," We talked about that earlier in the week. "
"7167390","7169730"," Talk about those numbers for weeks now, right?"
"7169990","7171430"," Past month, we've been talking about those numbers."
"7172870","7173850"," I'm a Tesla bull."
"7174830","7180570"," So I've got a alert set for those for when Tesla could possibly go down there. "
"7181330","7184890"," So what am I going to do when Tesla could possibly be going down there?"
"7185010","7186790"," I'm going to be waking up at 3.30 in the morning."
"7187750","7189190"," I don't care what my day was like."
"7191550","7193630"," And I'm going to probably. "
"7195870","7197090"," If that were going up now."
"7198830","7200030"," We're making some money here."
"7201430","7206810"," If we break into 80 cents, I'm going to move my stops to 70 cents. "
"7209770","7210870"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7213110","7214830"," Keep on pumping."
"7215990","7216990"," Double bottom. "
"7219030","7220770"," This really isn't double bottom."
"7220870","7224290"," You get one, two, three."
"7226690","7227850"," Give me that push. "
"7230750","7232350"," Get the Vwap underneath."
"7233310","7235090"," Moving averages coming underneath."
"7236810","7240030"," Again, we're getting sweaty. "
"7241410","7242170"," I feel it."
"7243890","7245130"," Feeling it over here."
"7245210","7246270"," You all feeling it over here?"
"7246730","7247030"," Feeling this?"
"7250310","7252670"," Let's look at some moving average targets. "
"7254150","7255650"," Oh, look at this monster."
"7255650","7257970"," Look at this monster."
"7258430","7261790"," Look at this range expansion up higher. "
"7262310","7263450"," Where are we going, bulls?"
"7264370","7266310"," Almost the perfect take on the 100."
"7266670","7268710"," It presents to Chinese five minutes."
"7268950","7271230"," I'm maintaining peace and stability on Korean Peninsula. "
"7271290","7273110"," Wasn't even more than shared go."
"7273810","7275210"," Oh, look at this."
"7276770","7279750"," Bulls reclaiming the 200 on the 15 minute chart. "
"7279990","7280550"," What does that mean?"
"7287590","7290850"," Oh, perfect claim."
"7291050","7292750"," Reclaim underneath there in the Vwap."
"7293690","7295270"," I'm getting itchy here. "
"7296270","7298010"," Is this looking bearish to you?"
"7299230","7300910"," I'll bearish this looking to you."
"7302650","7305710"," Oh, five minute, 15 minute time frame."
"7305870","7306570"," All very bullish. "
"7306790","7307190"," Highly bullish."
"7309650","7311670"," Thrust behind the bulls right now."
"7314080","7315460"," Thrust behind the bulls. "

"7355130","7356910"," This would be a good place for a trap of the bulls."
"7357290","7359030"," But on higher time frames. "
"7359650","7360290"," Very productive."
"7362850","7363830"," We'll watch it."
"7365190","7366350"," Be careful here. "
"7366550","7367030"," Bulls again."
"7367270","7368610"," Remember negative gamma."
"7369450","7372210"," If we were in positive gamma right here right now. "
"7373010","7374070"," Be full boat in it."
"7375870","7376930"," Full boat in it."
"7376930","7377590"," If this is fine. "
"7377590","7378830"," If we're in positive gamma right now."
"7378830","7379050"," As we."
"7380190","7383870"," Spy by by by by by by by by by. "
"7390180","7391380"," We're blasting now."
"7392060","7392900"," We're blasting."
"7393140","7393480"," Here we go. "
"7393600","7394020"," Blasting."
"7394880","7396700"," Probably see the viewer count go up."
"7396880","7399200"," Because you know there's some bulls and bears out there. "
"7399380","7399860"," Like oh shit."
"7399920","7401600"," I gotta go check on cap and see what they're doing."
"7402200","7402780"," Are they long?"
"7402940","7403560"," Are they short here?"
"7404700","7405580"," Don't tell them. "
"7407180","7409200"," Don't tell them if we're longer short here."
"7413920","7415000"," Seventeen cents now."
"7415300","7415900"," Seventeen nine cents. "
"7416220","7417720"," Coming into being in the money right now."
"7418800","7420480"," If you had if you had a target."
"7422620","7424260"," Taking some money off of them calls. "
"7424700","7426280"," What like a dollar thirty dollar forty."
"7426480","7426980"," Be kind of nice."
"7427160","7427420"," Wouldn't it. "
"7429060","7432020"," Be kind of nice to get like a dollar thirty dollar twenty."
"7432320","7433700"," Maybe start taking some off the top."
"7438740","7439720"," Seventy nine cents. "
"7439980","7440480"," Eighty cents."
"7441880","7443340"," Back down to seventy eight cents."
"7448240","7451900"," If we hit four hundred. "
"7452020","7452220"," I'm hitting."
"7452400","7453580"," I'm drinking four locos."
"7457120","7458060"," Bull bearish. "
"7458160","7458440"," Exactly."
"7458840","7459440"," Bull bearish."
"7460520","7461000"," Exactly. "
"7461400","7462480"," Which time frame are you on cap."
"7463280","7464480"," I'm on the one minute."
"7464600","7465100"," Bullish baby. "
"7465500","7466160"," I'm on the five minute."
"7466320","7466780"," Bullish baby."
"7467060","7467580"," I'm on the five minute. "
"7467580","7468020"," Eighteen minute."
"7468160","7468640"," Bullish baby."
"7469480","7470680"," How about the four hour. "
"7470800","7471440"," The one day cap."
"7471880","7472760"," Oh I'm bearish."
"7472820","7473260"," I'm looking for. "
"7473340","7478040"," I'm looking for just the just the just the just the to grab some liquidity up here to sell it"
"7478040","7478560"," all down."
"7481620","7483060"," What time frame are you on cap."
"7496760","7497320"," Bullish bear. "
"7497460","7497760"," I like that."
"7497980","7498540"," Bull bearish."
"7499700","7500920"," Bull bearish right now. "
"7504680","7505300"," Cap your side."
"7505420","7505720"," Your bullish."
"7505960","7506300"," Cap your side. "
"7506440","7506920"," Your bearish."
"7508020","7511180"," I'm a cheap I'm a cheap W-H-O-R-E."
"7511540","7512540"," The little kids are out there listening. "
"7513480","7514880"," You guys have you guys have to know."
"7514880","7515600"," I have to tell you guys something."
"7515840","7516900"," They get some bad news too. "
"7518720","7520620"," I'm gonna have to clean up the stream a little bit."
"7521800","7523120"," I gotta keep people happy."
"7525360","7527480"," So I'll have to come up with some words. "
"7530060","7531820"," That'll pass the YouTube muster."
"7533220","7536840"," YouTube's changing their, they're like, hey, we don't want you to swear."
"7537780","7542680"," They're like, you can say damn now, but you can't say certain words. "
"7542680","7545460"," And you can't do this and you can do that."
"7546300","7547920"," We're counting the words that you say."
"7549500","7550780"," All kinds of wonkiness. "
"7551400","7556000"," So I gotta come up with like, often like come up with a way to say words without actually saying"
"7556000","7557380"," them so you don't know what I'm saying."
"7559760","7562220"," Like the air muffs, you know what I mean?"
"7562840","7564560"," Like when you say something for your children."
"7565960","7567720"," So they don't hear a curse like a trucker. "
"7575890","7579910"," I'll switch from, I'll switch from bull to bear like a WHORE."
"7581850","7583170"," I have no problem."
"7585650","7586770"," Zero problem. "
"7589370","7591230"," Just grinding higher right now."
"7592170","7593870"," Calls are now 82 cents."
"7595630","7597330"," It stops at 70. "
"7597650","7599210"," I'm gonna raise them up here to 75."
"7600450","7601910"," I might get stopped out on doing that."
"7602050","7602950"," It might be a little too early. "
"7603670","7606850"," I'd rather see like 84, 85 to go to 80."
"7606850","7608070"," Maybe 85, 90."
"7609750","7613270"," So I'm at 75 cents and I'm gonna come incrementally up. "
"7615070","7616670"," Don't wanna give money back to the house."
"7619840","7620640"," Come on, baby."
"7621200","7621580"," Come on. "
"7622380","7623320"," Don't trap me here."
"7624860","7626220"," Don't do me a trap here."
"7626340","7628240"," I don't wanna see weakness a third try here. "
"7629080","7631100"," Keep your eyes on book map right now."
"7631260","7633080"," We're coming into some sellers again."
"7636870","7641770"," This is a problem with selling or this is a problem with strength when you're like you're showing"
"7641770","7643330"," strength in a negative environment. "
"7644050","7647550"," They're gonna wanna come right in and just take the wind right out of your sails."
"7648070","7649930"," This is a good teaching moment."
"7650110","7655290"," If you're a trader, right?"
"7655670","7658350"," You don't understand at least just basic game of concepts. "
"7659250","7660570"," When we're in negative camera, right?"
"7660830","7666830"," So if we were in positive game and you had that set up for a market or market bottom or"
"7666830","7672490"," top that you think is there, yeah, like so right now, let's say if we were back in October 13th,"
"7672790","7678670"," we're in negative gamma and this five and 15 minute chart is showing you the way is higher and you"
"7678670","7680830"," know we're kind of instead of some kind of a bottom."
"7681050","7685670"," You had a big volume accumulation in the past two or three days, not just one morning."
"7687830","7691330"," This would be a set up to go long in a negative game environment. "
"7692330","7697750"," We've got what, one day, two, basically two, three days of consolidation, but we had five, I think"
"7697750","7698950"," five or six days of down."
"7700310","7705830"," You know, it's not gonna have the power that you're hoping for it to have."
"7707130","7708970"," I'm like two pennies away from getting the boot. "
"7711090","7714810"," I'm about to get booted and close."
"7719690","7721630"," So, you know, it's a really risky."
"7722890","7725410"," Like you have some intraday reason to go up here. "
"7726230","7729290"," Well, we are just at 85 or 85 cents right now."
"7731290","7736390"," I give some intraday reason to go up but we don't have like the market's turn and we're going up"
"7736390","7739210"," to 430 today that we don't have that."
"7739450","7748030"," So, but if we were down at the bottoms of the dumps, if we'd been selling the entire retracement or"
"7748030","7754170"," not the retracement, we'd sold 100% of the previous retracement, you could pause it that this would"
"7754170","7754610"," be a bottom. "
"7755370","7760970"," But just on an intraday, two, three days, five days and negative gamma, be careful."
"7764240","7765720"," 86 cents right now."
"7767300","7777730"," If we get out, if we get $1.20, if we get $1.30, if we go higher, oh"
"7777730","7777990"," baby. "
"7779950","7783350"," Willy smokes me saying yes buyers are overtaken the sellers."
"7785430","7786210"," Not quite."
"7786970","7787810"," They're selling into it. "
"7788250","7792170"," Every time buyers overtaken the sellers, the sellers are selling into strength."
"7795380","7796840"," I'm about to get kicked out now."
"7796920","7797140"," I'm close. "
"7798980","7799660"," I'm getting there."
"7800900","7801860"," About two pennies away."
"7803000","7804080"," One penny away. "
"7805420","7806080"," I'm out."
"7808180","7811160"," I'm gonna check, let me just take my activity real quick."
"7823400","7824280"," Oh yeah. "
"7829910","7832330"," Account is looking fucking fat, bro."
"7833910","7834810"," Account is looking good."
"7836350","7836830"," Okay. "
"7837570","7845590"," A little bit of a liquidity grab down here."
"7852460","7854180"," I'm flat right now if you wanna know."
"7857850","7860290"," I'm gonna watch this to see if this support holds true. "
"7864680","7866560"," They're just selling right into this, aren't they?"
"7866720","7867480"," Just selling right in here."
"7868480","7870320"," Every time we get some strength, they're selling."
"7870940","7872540"," Get some strength, they're selling. "
"7874140","7878720"," Strength in buyers, selling, all indicative of negative gamma, right?"
"7880420","7883080"," Just selling right into any strength, right?"
"7883680","7887540"," These are all setups that are looking very bullish for a move higher."
"7887760","7892200"," In a 15 minute chart, five minute chart, everything here looks like set up verbal."
"7893260","7895120"," But you can see that they're selling right into it. "
"7897760","7904660"," On Twitter this morning, I posted a post it to you that this is a good time on a larger"
"7904660","7907740"," timeframe to be looking."
"7908040","7913520"," So if you're, I said this morning on Twitter, I had said, if you didn't have a hedge, it's probably"
"7913520","7914580"," a good time to have a hedge."
"7915680","7920740"," I told you this, people were asking when I meant by structuring it, and we'll look at that real"
"7920740","7920980"," quick. "
"7922680","7925740"," Oh man, I don't know if this is the time to look at it real quick, but we should."
"7926740","7927920"," People were asking about it."
"7933500","7936920"," So let's say you're going to put a market hedge on, so we're coming up higher, right?"
"7937220","7944160"," So let's say, or let's say this morning, I said to you, this is a good time to start thinking"
"7944160","7945160"," about a market hedge. "
"7946100","7952560"," So you can go to a tasty or you can go to, you can go to, what is it called?"
"7953360","7954900"," Off options, profit calculator."
"7956180","7966160"," They won't, they won't, the calculations aren't based on, or they don't, you can"
"7966160","7970860"," add in interest and gamma and, not gamma, but a ball and stuff like that."
"7971580","7974240"," I can enter that stuff in, but they'll give you like a baseline idea. "
"7975140","7984060"," That's what I was saying to, on Twitter today was, whatever hedge that you get, make sure there's"
"7984060","7984700"," some time on it."
"7987300","7988680"," It's meant for a market crash."
"7990180","7994140"," So can your hedge take a move up higher and then a crash like this?"
"7996260","8000040"," And this is farther in time like March to put the time on it, right?"
"8000300","8000940"," I should make this bigger. "
"8002940","8012800"," Can your hedge, if you're going to place the hedge on, here's"
"8014760","8015720"," March over here, right?"
"8016120","8017120"," March 23rd."
"8018140","8024240"," Can your market hedge with spin, with stand something like this?"
"8027000","8027700"," Can it?"
"8030180","8031820"," What would it print down here?"
"8033560","8035960"," Can it, will it make huge money down here?"
"8036420","8036780"," Does that make sense?"
"8038260","8044080"," Is it just the put spread in March up here?"
"8045220","8046280"," You know what I mean by that?"
"8046480","8050520"," Like you should be thinking about if you're going to put up a hedge in the market for market crash,"
"8050560","8051360"," put enough time on it."
"8051980","8052560"," Can it withstand?"
"8053020","8056240"," Can you hold it up here and not panic?"
"8058080","8063000"," If you put a hedge in the market, can it withstand this?"
"8064700","8072220"," And can you trade the market up with other money and not be full, full crazy with this thing?"
"8072900","8074460"," Just in case it never comes back. "
"8074580","8078180"," Let's see, we never come back here and you have to make the money back to cover the hedge that"
"8078180","8080400"," you had, right?"
"8080480","8082360"," So it shouldn't be like 100% hedge in the market."
"8083420","8084160"," Does that make sense?"
"8085000","8088660"," So then at least if it doesn't crash, you can come back and say, well, I don't really care about"
"8088660","8092880"," that 5% of my account because I made 10% on this move higher."
"8093540","8095220"," So I was net positive 5%. "
"8098350","8101430"," Better than being long over here and having a crash, right?"
"8101710","8102790"," Just losing all your money."
"8103630","8105310"," 100% full long in the market."
"8109130","8110450"," How do you express that?"
"8117500","8121520"," Cool part is if you just have a normal, we're expected to have a normal decline here. "
"8122100","8125040"," You probably get out of your market hedge if you don't have a crash, right?"
"8125580","8131720"," If we just go down for a month or two, two weeks, three weeks on that downward trend that everybody"
"8131720","8132360"," talks about."
"8137300","8138740"," It's just in a larger time frame."
"8138940","8144920"," If you're like, well, if I'm thinking about a cap, I didn't have a hedge or I missed this entire"
"8144920","8145840"," move down cap. "
"8148040","8149860"," This is the place somewhere in here."
"8150040","8155940"," 96 counterparties take two sport $176 trillion at bed for reverse repo operation."
"8156680","8159500"," You should somewhere in here between now and Monday. "
"8160420","8160760"," Call it Monday."
"8161700","8162880"," Have something on."
"8165020","8172040"," If you still fail to put something on, and you want to wait for FMC, that makes sense. "
"8172220","8182060"," If you're a bear, but you're like, if you're a"
"8182060","8186140"," bear and you're like, this is probably the implied move to, I'll be honest with you guys."
"8186860","8191600"," So like right here, you'll see me, I'm going to do a crystal ball for you."
"8192500","8202459"," You probably see me have some targets up here for CPI and for quite a"
"8202459","8203540"," large range expansion. "
"8205180","8206840"," It's kind of neat how they're doing this, right?"
"8207040","8207879"," Look what they're doing right here."
"8208740","8209639"," How they're lining this up."
"8211200","8212760"," Bring us all the way down. "
"8214620","8216180"," Get CPI over here, right?"
"8218600","8220020"," Got a hold on a second here."
"8220660","8222120"," See how they're doing this to us?"
"8222840","8223299"," Nasty."
"8224580","8227320"," Got a CPI over here, right?"
"8230620","8232139"," Probably 11.30 over here. "
"8232139","8232920"," I don't think Zach times."
"8235120","8235580"," Yep."
"8236080","8237799"," There's just trying to hammer the market. "
"8238639","8239840"," Just trying to hammer it."
"8243620","8251100"," You got market makers trying to get us to come sideways into market"
"8251100","8254440"," makers alike."
"8254440","8254840"," Okay. "
"8256760","8259879"," We got J-POW next week and they're like, okay."
"8262180","8265700"," They're like, we got some crazy bulls."
"8265700","8267660"," I was saying they're going at 4.30 a pair. "
"8267740","8268580"," I don't know what they're talking about."
"8271240","8273559"," We got a, we got some bears."
"8273900","8276360"," They're just trying to front runs crashing the market. "
"8277080","8278400"," We got Mike Burry."
"8279080","8282299"," Mike Burry is trying to just, just check crashing us down here."
"8282320","8285480"," We got bull saying we're getting Christmas holiday rally. "
"8287340","8290040"," And we got some huge roll events coming up."
"8293200","8296480"," So we're going to start the market right into this."
"8297180","8298280"," Right into this event. "
"8298940","8302799"," We'll get them their range expansion here and here."
"8308350","8313170"," And then we'll, then, then, then we'll, we'll shut it down in here, reprice the entire market."
"8313370","8317870"," We'll make our move lower or our move higher after the event. "
"8318110","8318389"," You get it?"
"8320410","8325350"," So now you're going to get some heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy bear hitters and they're just"
"8325350","8329530"," loading on puts and they're just loading on puts and they're just loading on puts."
"8329530","8331910"," So what does, what do the dealers have to do?"
"8331969","8334030"," They're like, we ain't crashing this ship, bro."
"8334629","8335930"," We're going to train against you, man. "
"8336709","8337510"," Does that make sense?"
"8340290","8342150"," Does that make sense to you out there?"
"8343370","8345389"," So they're just loading the boat with puts."
"8347290","8350450"," And so the dealers are saying, I mean, there's hammering."
"8350530","8351250"," There's hammering. "
"8351410","8351950"," There's hammering."
"8352290","8356250"," Sometimes you get some real money selling and so they're catching, they're catching it, right?"
"8356250","8359709"," So you get some real equity selling in here while they're loading the boat with puts."
"8360230","8363730"," So on a down rip, they make, they make, they make some bank on those zero dates. "
"8364290","8364950"," You see what I'm saying?"
"8365549","8368469"," So the, so, so you get dealers trying to hedge all this trade, right?"
"8370740","8375420"," Start trading back down into CPI and to J-Powd out in here and see how that goes."
"8376219","8378799"," Dealers stop helping out the bulls."
"8379620","8381920"," All the bearish bets are placed now. "
"8382559","8384879"," Start trading sideways into the event."
"8386219","8388500"," Start torching your calls, torching your puts."
"8389360","8391160"," So you guys make, understand that?"
"8391580","8393380"," Well, more than likely come into the market. "
"8393540","8395720"," You'll see me do a live stream and I'll, I'll actually tag."
"8397100","8398890"," I'll say this is your high end, right?"
"8401200","8402140"," I'll say it down."
"8402360","8403280"," Here's your low end. "
"8403940","8406680"," You're actually going to hear me post on Twitter at some point."
"8407440","8408600"," Expect range expansion."
"8409840","8411880"," And this is what I'm talking about right here. "
"8413500","8416560"," I'm going to tell you on Twitter today, expect some consolidation in here."
"8420100","8420920"," You guys get what I'm saying?"
"8421580","8425700"," Bulls are just hoping that the dealers, bulls are hoping that the bears are just blowing the,"
"8425700","8429000"," blowing the boat and puts so they can get up here for a little bit."
"8429580","8430260"," Catch a breather. "
"8430780","8435980"," Bears can then say small retail players can then say, okay, I'm going to put some puts on up here."
"8439160","8439660"," Makes sense?"
"8439920","8440760"," I'm not going to put them down here."
"8441160","8441980"," I'm going to put them up here. "
"8442960","8444340"," I'm going to get better positioning."
"8445500","8447920"," Nobody cares about my position and I'm a small guy."
"8449020","8449460"," Right?"
"8449500","8450480"," I'm just taking small positions. "
"8450580","8451240"," I'm not a big bank."
"8452300","8454580"," I'm not going to, I'm not going to make the market react."
"8455200","8460300"," I'm not buying 50 million dollars and puts down here and watch the market trade higher, right?"
"8461660","8465640"," So I'm going to sneak around that big bear that's buying all them big puts down here. "
"8465920","8468100"," It's just slam in the market, slam the market."
"8468840","8471720"," I'm going to go, ooh, I'm going to follow them dealers."
"8472740","8478860"," And I'm going to reposition myself up here and hopefully down the road that 50 million dollar put"
"8478860","8483240"," buyers going to come back in with another 50 million dollars and help me out now. "
"8483880","8489100"," I'm like the, I'm like the little fish that falls next to the big shark and I like nibble the,"
"8489220","8494580"," nibble the little growth and moss and sea crap on them."
"8495880","8501900"," Sea scum, the barnacles that are growing on that big nasty great white shark."
"8502700","8505900"," I'm swimming right by his ass and I'm like, okay, I'm going to sneak in over here. "
"8506820","8509260"," I'm going to sneak up in here and position myself with that bear."
"8509940","8513480"," I'm going to get better positioning of that bear that has to wait the market down."
"8514020","8515400"," He's impacting the market. "
"8515900","8516600"," Does that make sense?"
"8518600","8519560"," See that range?"
"8520020","8520560"," You guys seeing it?"
"8521200","8521740"," Right there."
"8523820","8524920"," That range developing."
"8526200","8530260"," You'll start to see the options market price all this stuff in as we head into these two events. "
"8532000","8533280"," Everybody's getting looped up."
"8533280","8534440"," He got bears out there."
"8534580","8535140"," They're getting there. "
"8536080","8543320"," The bears are getting these big five gallon jugs of like winter time low viscosity oil."
"8544080","8547580"," Just looping themselves up and stuff, you know, doing their arms and stuff like that."
"8549880","8551360"," He got bulls out there. "
"8551440","8551920"," They're sweating."
"8553040","8554960"," He got like a bull with a full beautiful coat on."
"8555080","8558240"," He's losing his fur and his hair from all the stress. "
"8559020","8564240"," His wife's telling him to sleep in in the daytime, hurting his voice on live streams."
"8574080","8575120"," sweaty bulls."
"8575540","8577780"," Got all kinds of sweating, you know. "
"8580720","8585020"," Meanwhile, the dealers are in here just trying to stabilize the market."
"8586940","8588580"," For the events, right?"
"8590630","8596090"," You see that trying to stabilize the markets, trying to account for bear bets, trying to account"
"8596090","8596890"," for bull bets."
"8597990","8599950"," Just trying to keep it right here. "
"8600410","8602530"," Isn't that crazy?"
"8611980","8613340"," So far, right?"
"8613560","8614600"," We know that we've got."
"8615580","8617240"," This is the rug pole, right?"
"8618000","8619940"," We know where to go down below here, right?"
"8620180","8621020"," If they pull the rug."
"8624960","8627720"," We know if they pull the rug on J power, the CPI. "
"8629400","8630480"," Deps of hell, right?"
"8630880","8632160"," We already have targets, right?"
"8632300","8635680"," 3, 7, 7, 0, I think is 1, 3, 8, 8, 2."
"8638680","8640180"," Part 3820 is 1."
"8640400","8641360"," We've got even lower targets."
"8643060","8644820"," JPM targets are a 3, 5."
"8646780","8647320"," What is it?"
"8647500","8649040"," 3, 5, 8, 0 or something like that?"
"8649200","8650060"," 3, 5, 7, 9, I remember."
"8653160","8653960"," We'll take a look at that. "
"8656280","8657560"," They don't want to pull that stuff."
"8657740","8659720"," They don't want to pay that stuff, right?"
"8659960","8664460"," They don't want to pay some guy coming in the market, trying to slam it down with 0 or 8"
"8664460","8666320"," puts on an liquidity break."
"8667460","8670760"," And not even the liquidity on a real equity selling break, right?"
"8672760","8679560"," We've got equity market guys in women and men and women, them, they, whoever you are, staying up"
"8679560","8683240"," all night long, making sure we're not making this break down here, right?"
"8683840","8688900"," The real true market participants are awake at 3 o'clock in the morning or 1 o'clock in the"
"8688900","8692080"," morning seeing if we have that bloodbath here, right?"
"8692560","8694440"," I know who has real positions. "
"8695760","8697460"," I'll tell you exactly who has real positions."
"8697880","8699700"," They're awake last night watching that move."
"8700660","8701500"," They weren't sleeping. "
"8702660","8703760"," I know they weren't sleeping."
"8705800","8709040"," There's nobody sleeping with a position on last night."
"8709900","8717340"," If you were, if you were sleeping with a position on last night, you got some, you got, you're a,"
"8717460","8721920"," you're very strong, or you have very strong convictions. "
"8727580","8728840"," Very strong convictions."
"8729460","8730280"," So what happens here?"
"8730460","8732560"," So I'm just showing you guys that stuff right now, right?"
"8732760","8733560"," What does that mean, right?"
"8734880","8738340"," For you as an intraday player or intraday trader."
"8739100","8741200"," It means that you need to be careful. "
"8743360","8746760"," Because as we come into these, so time is against the bull here."
"8747020","8747700"," I want you to know that."
"8748600","8749800"," Time is against the bull. "
"8750300","8757140"," Bull has some time on their hands here, but as time passes, you're going to see this bell curve"
"8757140","8758040"," coming back down here."
"8759680","8761080"," You're going to see bets be placed."
"8761380","8762880"," You're going to see everybody put their bets on the market. "
"8763680","8765960"," You're going to see dealers hedge all these bearish bets."
"8767140","8770460"," So bears, you get, I mean bulls, you have to be constructive here, okay?"
"8771100","8777340"," I want you to also be realized that you get sellers just predetermined selling this, right?"
"8777480","8778640"," These are bull bears."
"8779440","8783380"," They'll, they'll add to their position up here in these highs. "
"8783660","8787880"," So, you know, if you're a bull here, even just intraday, right?"
"8788180","8793460"," You're looking for some weakness at some point coming into the CPI."
"8794180","8795380"," They're probably going to want to park it."
"8795960","8797220"," We might not be right here. "
"8798000","8802840"," I'm not saying they're going to park it like right at 390 for CPI and JPOP, but they're going to"
"8802840","8806840"," try to park this thing in a sideways move here."
"8806960","8807700"," I guarantee it."
"8808720","8809020"," Okay. "
"8814570","8815290"," Well, there."

"8826430","8830090"," Bull's want to take up 400.50. Should I rate, should I post it on Twitter?"
"8830830","8835130"," Price target 40, 400.50. On the spy."
"8840890","8841770"," Should I post that?"
"8841930","8842610"," I'll post that on Twitter."
"8851280","8852460"," I don't think we get there, but. "
"8853560","8854960"," So bulls want to see, right?"
"8863420","8864140"," Spy 400."
"8864940","8866120"," Point five zero, baby."

"8938880","8941600"," It's roughly there at 300,000, 320,000."
"8942500","8944100"," You'll see the move higher taper off."
"8946440","8947840"," They usually max out right around there. "
"8947980","8950300"," Whoever's buying those large positional puts."
"8953780","8957060"," So keep an eye on that 395 P is the one to watch."

"9256010","9257470"," Just drawing a little line down here, right?"
"9258210","9259450"," You're all a happy line, right?"
"9260190","9264430"," You're looking to see how long, looking to see how long the consolidation lasts, right?"
"9264430","9266590"," Well, what are we doing this for?"
"9266730","9269870"," We're doing this because we want to see if we've got consolidation or distribution, right?"
"9270530","9273770"," We just want to see what happens here, see if we can get a move higher."
"9273930","9274710"," Where is the move higher?"
"9275990","9276630"," Hey, buddy. "
"9276930","9277410"," How are you doing here?"
"9278210","9280930"," Move hires to 39725, right?"
"9281250","9282670"," One more push higher, right?"
"9282930","9283430"," Slam up here."
"9284070","9286710"," What happens if we come up here?"
"9286830","9287550"," This is a bear's thinking."
"9288830","9289950"," It's a bear thinking, right?"
"9290090","9290890"," A bear's like, okay. "
"9292010","9293230"," I got my single top."
"9293230","9294750"," I haven't posted it in chat yet."
"9295130","9295930"," I haven't watched it. "
"9297450","9300930"," And as soon as we touch right here, I'm going to go right in the chat and say, hey, Cap,"
"9301770","9303430"," there's a double top form in brother."
"9307250","9309970"," Bulls are like, what does a bull want to see?"
"9310050","9311910"," A bull wants to see a blast through our two?"
"9312870","9314130"," And some consolidation, right?"
"9315010","9315750"," That's what you want to see."
"9317670","9319530"," You don't want to see the rejection, do you?"
"9319650","9320510"," This is what a bear wants to see. "
"9320790","9324510"," The US has votes to pass the defense policy bill, and the vote is ongoing."
"9324990","9329050"," A bear wants to see this in some kind of rejection below, right?"
"9329870","9330490"," Hey, Cap."
"9330670","9333250"," Hey, Cap got a double top up here. "
"9334730","9335550"," You know what I'm saying?"
"9342140","9343080"," So, yeah, one more plunge."
"9343220","9343860"," We're not done yet."
"9344100","9345060"," Just so you know, we're going up. "
"9345800","9346660"," We're not done here."
"9346760","9347460"," I don't think we're done here."
"9348620","9350880"," Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think we're going down yet. "
"9352940","9354360"," My viewer consolidating."
"9356220","9357540"," One more rip higher, I think."
"9358140","9360620"," Keep it wrong here, but not always right here. "
"9361300","9362160"," Sometimes you get it wrong."
"9363480","9365340"," No such thing as always being right."
"9370510","9373670"," Imagine getting up there for imagine blasting through our three. "
"9374430","9376330"," Oh, man, that would piss some people off."
"9386020","9387580"," So you guys can see the day."
"9389080","9390680"," Be careful down here, right?"
"9391040","9392540"," We've got a giant gap down here. "
"9393060","9395500"," I'd love to fill this gap at some point."
"9395660","9396800"," We'd love to."
"9397880","9401240"," If I was a bear, I'd be like, I'm looking for some failure up here. "
"9401860","9405380"," And I want to fill this gap down below and trap all those bulls."
"9406220","9406540"," That was a bear."
"9408020","9408800"," That's what I'd be doing. "
"9409840","9411260"," Just sitting right here, just waiting."
"9414120","9417740"," Have some stops above me in case we do get this stupid crazy move higher."
"9419420","9420360"," That's what I'd be doing. "
"9421460","9423340"," Like market reversal, trend reversal."
"9423340","9424780"," That was a bear."
"9425520","9428620"," You guys notice this is like the same setup for the bull. "
"9428860","9429400"," The bears, right?"
"9429560","9430220"," As it is for the bulls."
"9431020","9431720"," Same setup."
"9433560","9439080"," Some bears will tell you you get bears out there that'll say things like, um, never short into"
"9439080","9441160"," strength, even if it's only in today. "
"9442120","9444180"," So they'd be like, I'm not even going to attempt this."
"9444700","9445580"," So I'm going to wait up here."
"9446900","9448900"," The bears saying I'm going to wait right here. "
"9449580","9452420"," Just appear waiting depending upon the risk they want to put on."
"9452420","9453960"," They know where the stops are."
"9454080","9458680"," So if they stop out here, they'll then go above and look up here for the next chance to short,"
"9458900","9458940"," right?"
"9459480","9463660"," So just like, just like bulls, we talked to bulls, right?"
"9464000","9465660"," You know that there are going to be bears up here. "
"9466720","9470060"," And you got, you know, the bears are going to say, okay, I'm going to start my short up here."
"9471240","9472180"," Put a tight stop."
"9472480","9474100"," If I get overrun, they run over me. "
"9474660","9475640"," I'm going to cut myself loose."
"9475800","9477440"," I'm going to set myself back up up here."
"9478240","9478740"," It's my stops. "
"9479080","9480660"," I'm going to do it again up here until I'm right."
"9481180","9481620"," Does that make sense?"
"9483260","9488240"," Hopefully that eventually will pay off some kind of a death deal in bloodbath down here to the"
"9488240","9488960"," depths of hell."
"9494240","9499260"," But until then, until the dead bears probably move higher, likely. "
"9499940","9501240"," Not guaranteed, but likely."
"9506600","9508660"," As a bull, you want to be thinking about that."
"9508880","9510080"," Where are the bears hiding, right?"
"9510580","9511400"," Where are the machines hiding?"
"9511700","9512820"," Where's supply hiding?"
"9517740","9519020"," No need to lose either. "
"9519560","9522840"," So if you're, like, yesterday we took call spreads into the bell."
"9524080","9526120"," You know, you're talking about the trade starting."
"9527120","9529360"," Trade started at the, at the close yesterday, right?"
"9529880","9530580"," You guys were all here. "
"9530860","9532920"," I figured who was, make yourself known."
"9533200","9537380"," Someone said, uh, so yesterday we were looking at divergences early in the day and someone came"
"9537380","9540840"," back in the chat yesterday and said, Hey, Cap, take a look over at the bond market."
"9541240","9543360"," The bond market's saying that the equity market's liars. "
"9544120","9545440"," So we went back and looked yesterday."
"9546300","9547020"," Before the close."
"9548320","9550220"," And I was like, I want to buy it down here. "
"9550480","9551520"," We didn't get down there."
"9551640","9552780"," And so my gosh, shit, I got to get in."
"9552900","9555840"," So we, this trade started yesterday, right?"
"9556200","9558840"," Again, again, and again. "
"9559680","9562300"," So if you're, you know, like someone right here is saying, I'm done for the day."
"9562400","9563760"," Crazy 80 or someone is saying, I'm done for the day."
"9563980","9565200"," Yeah, you don't need to get all this. "
"9566020","9571900"," You don't need to get like, there's no need to be like, my first set of calls was right here."
"9572300","9574840"," You know, there's just places to buy calls."
"9575920","9578480"," Just if this rolls over for more, more support. "
"9578780","9579520"," Yeah, I'd take that trade."
"9579960","9580860"," I'll take that trade."
"9581100","9583240"," If we roll down here, I'd take that trade there. "
"9583520","9583880"," Makes sense."
"9584440","9589200"," If we tap here, look back for some support, maybe I might take that trade too."
"9589260","9591480"," If we get some consolidation, I'd like to see a break above though. "
"9592220","9595780"," And then consolidate and then liquidity a break and then take that next leg higher."
"9596900","9602060"," So there's some trades in here, but you need to, uh, you know, make sure you're buying the right"
"9602060","9604360"," trade or taking the right trade."
"9605480","9606120"," More. "
"9609760","9613900"," Look at that blasting higher right now as predicted."
"9616900","9618300"," Trying to get up there."
"9626120","9626760"," Probability. "
"9628640","9630280"," Probably hadn't up there."
"9631620","9632580"," It's like magic."
"9633860","9638940"," Again, some, uh, some, uh, the letter P and letter P touches. "
"9641600","9642080"," 39714."
"9642800","9644880"," We want 39725 minimum."
"9646780","9651300"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. "
"9653420","9654300"," How does that feel?"
"9655000","9656280"," How does that feel right there?"
"9657000","9657980"," Does that feel good right there?"
"9657980","9658060"," there."
"9658900","9662700"," You see that high five slap the top of the key."
"9667870","9668550"," Oh, yeah. "
"9671230","9671670"," Oh."
"9675070","9677510"," That feel right there I feel good."
"9678110","9678790"," How's that feel?"
"9680850","9681990"," How's that feel right there?"
"9682230","9682830"," How's that look there?"
"9684070","9685050"," That feels good, right?"
"9685630","9686610"," Look at that move. "
"9688810","9690730"," Consolidation slap VWAP."
"9692410","9694490"," Consolidation didn't last long at all."
"9695870","9697410"," Slap that ask. "
"9698530","9699570"," Slap it."
"9700450","9702890"," Slap that ask."
"9709830","9713770"," Just seeing a note from analysts here stocks climbed off a very five-day slide with traders"

"9796180","9797060"," They're like, I don't know. "
"9797180","9800160"," I gotta go back and talk to, I gotta go tag to my bear clan."

"9966960","9970640"," If any of you guys remember the old school, I was just relating this."
"9971040","9971900"," I was talking to my wife."
"9972180","9974620"," I was asking her if she remembers the old cartoons. "
"9975720","9979780"," The old one of our other cartoons, there would be Wild E."
"9979920","9986640"," Coyote and a sheepdog would go to work every morning and they hated each other and the sheepdog is"
"9986640","9989320"," looking over his sheep and of course, Wild E."
"9989380","9996580"," Coyote is trying to eat sheep and so they would like clock in and this old cartoon and they hated"
"9996580","9997040"," each other."
"9997900","10003700"," Then as soon as the day was over in the episode of the cartoon, they would walk back to their"
"10003700","10008160"," time clock out and they were friends once again."
"10009800","10011320"," I was relating to her. "
"10011380","10013040"," I feel like that's what it's like on social media."
"10013300","10019400"," You have this big persona and you're like shit non-bulls and shit non-bears and then you go back"

"10049690","10050050"," It's hilarious."
"10051330","10054070"," Some of the stuff that was in those old cartoons is really bad. "
"10054610","10059430"," Really the misogynistic, racist, stupid shit."
"10060190","10062510"," But there's a lot of cool lessons they taught to and that stuff."
"10067530","10068370"," And violence. "
"10068830","10069530"," That was the big one."
"10069650","10074530"," I just read a story about the violence that used to be in those cartoons versus kids cartoons"
"10074530","10075050"," today."
"10075510","10082170"," Although my youngest daughter likes that manger or manga stuff and that stuff man. "
"10082830","10087410"," There's like an article I read that said that the violence that used to be in old cartoons and I'm"
"10087410","10092330"," like I don't know my daughter, some of the stuff she watched like seven deadly sins."
"10093230","10096250"," Like what is that with this with seven deadly sins."
"10097290","10105170"," And then they got like this really creepy like creepy like kids like dressing up in sexualized"
"10105170","10105470"," ways. "
"10106210","10107410"," I'm like you can't watch this."

"10112050","10115270"," You guys know kids are trying to their kids are all watching this crap."
"10115510","10117090"," Some of it's not so bad."
"10117090","10120530"," Some of it's very safe. "

"10140230","10142750"," There's no agreement at all. "
"10144010","10150890"," Just a conversation and had a brief conversation with the founder of book map."
"10152070","10159290"," And trying to put together something so we can get a book map training class made for you guys."
"10161230","10166570"," They'll be public and free for you guys to watch and what we'll do is we'll go through different"

"14663440","14667840"," that you see we should revert if we trade higher we should come right back down if we trade lower"
"14667840","14675520"," we should come right back and the dealers are probably focused on this on this zone right here now"
"14675520","14681620"," i can't guarantee that okay i'm not going to guarantee that i think that's what that's what's"

"14735480","14740620"," one-to-one trades like calls have a real true ability to make you a ton of money puts you"
"14740620","14745540"," can make a lot of money but you need big movements for that money to be made uh you guys"
"14745540","14755000"," have all you guys shorting is better sometimes um but man that's looking like it isn't it it's"
"14756830","14765470"," looking like that trade's coming up here and it's really looking like it they killed those puts for"
"14765470","14773070"," today the dealers did so i would expect to move down got a gap down here below at 392 55"
"14773070","14781130"," so something outside the money three you got a good couple points of interest down here clean all"
"14781130","14791050"," this mess up over the weakness here into the bell bears trying to take right over"

"14836700","14845110"," buying going on that could that could lead to weakness since tomorrow i see that trade because i"
"14845110","14854310"," see the weak trade in tomorrow i'd give it like a i'd give it like a uh 35"
"14854310","14864270"," probability of happening into tomorrow that's still very low if i"
"14864270","14869690"," saw this if i saw this move into the close here oh i would want to take that so bad"
"14870950","14877910"," i'd want to take a short there without a doubt there's still more room to go higher but you could"
"14877910","14884090"," probably beat it if you have the uh i think this is the this is the this is where you"
"14884090","14891890"," get the head in the shoulders through the shoulder this will be the head some kind of a swoop up"
"14891890","14898470"," there and then down this is the this is the this is the shoulder if you guys don't know this"
"14898470","14907500"," could go higher too i think this is 78 percent up here last up in the overnight then you take"

"15665640","15671300"," priciness of the puts for tomorrow or coming off so we've got those puts those 395s that are"
"15671300","15679320"," expiring tomorrow are now only about dollar 66 they were a dollar 89 about 15 minutes ago so"
"15679320","15685460"," they're just grinding grinding uh the more they grind those puts down in value the more probability"
"15685460","15691380"," we're going there so those puts were very expensive if they can if they can kill those puts for"
"15691380","15698640"," tomorrow uh there's a chance we get down there for them you guys understand that concept i buy puts"
"15698640","15707460"," for a dollar so the simple way to understand this i buy puts for a dollar right i want them"
"15707460","15717040"," to go to two dollars the dealer says i'm not paying you two dollars i'll go bankrupt you need to"
"15717040","15722660"," find other people to believe it's going to two dollars in the meantime i'm going to knock these"
"15722660","15729940"," puts down to 50 cents right so you're like shit i'm upside down i'm at 50 cents right now so"
"15729940","15736700"," you go find five other people and you tell them hey look these puts can go to three dollars and"
"15736700","15743720"," they're dirt cheap they only cost 50 cents right so you buy these puts at 50 cents new group five"
"15743720","15751160"," people buy 50 cents right meanwhile you load up on more puts at 50 cents now your dollar cost"
"15751160","15757100"," average is 75 cents right let's start going up in value right so you need to find another group of"
"15757100","15764340"," people to believe that they can get four dollars out of those puts meanwhile you don't give a fine"
"15764340","15770060"," shit about whether they go to four dollars you don't care at all your dollar cost average was 75"
"15770060","15778180"," cents the second group is now 50 cents they're now they're now at a dollar dollar 25 and you're now"
"15778180","15782300"," trying to get more people to believe that so you need the first group the second group the third"
"15782300","15787400"," group the fourth group the sixth group you need the need the mantra the mantra the mantra the"
"15787400","15794600"," mantra you need wave after wave after wave this goes for calls too wave after wave after wave and"

"15798960","15808200"," and some guy before them said i'm telling you these puts right these puts are worth five dollars"
"15808200","15813380"," they just paid five dollars from i'm telling you they can go to six dollars or they say they can"

"15818640","15822620"," they hold on the group comes in but if they don't believe that they kind of don't think so i"
"15822620","15829380"," think they might just go to six dollars you get a less less people buying those puts right the"
"15829380","15833740"," first group's taken care of and they sold you those bags that's why you get the term when you guys"
"15833740","15839320"," here i'm selling you my bags or buy my bags or anything like that because there's two or three or"
