"7109","8090"," Maybe that's better."
"46650","48150"," Maybe that's better right now."
"48570","50070"," So let me know if it's better. "
"64500","65560"," I think that's better."
"83750","88270"," Let me know in the chat if that's better."
"98760","99280"," Stop. "
"103430","106330"," Check your cogwheel and see if it's on 720p."
"115600","118780"," I don't know why my broadcast isn't in 1080p."
"118960","127740"," I got to check my settings and see why I'm not. "
"127919","129419"," I should be streaming in 1080p and I'm not."
"135950","136550"," That's better."
"137890","140570"," Yeah, some big buyers just stepped in on the spy. "
"141890","143810"," So this reversal that you see right here."
"145290","146770"," Brought right back up, no problem."
"147490","149890"," They got this some buyers stepped right in. "
"150570","156450"," Big buyers stepped in on 380s, 380c for the first."
"157030","167010"," And then big buyers stepped in on June, on 630, 380c for the 30th and the"
"167010","167250"," first."
"169550","171050"," And this quick roll over right here. "
"174390","180850"," I probably started above 381 currently, but I'm long here."
"186420","188280"," VIX is breaking down right now too."
"188420","189500"," You should see a nice squeeze higher. "
"191400","193480"," VIX is breaking down to that 2850 level."
"195160","197440"," There's a giant gap that needs to be filled there as well."
"200540","202560"," I should get a decent squeeze here. "
"202560","203340"," I want to show you guys."
"203380","204500"," I'm going to show you guys something here."
"206440","207180"," Hold on here. "
"209160","210160"," See, they can show it."
"213740","216380"," I want to show some gaps here."
"218560","228440"," I'm going to bring"
"228440","229680"," this over here for you real quick. "
"231500","239690"," There's a giant gap that needs to be filled"
"239690","248830"," right there."
"249490","250090"," A giant gap."
"250970","251950"," See it back here. "
"254210","255250"," Resting back on that."
"255370","256690"," This is from yesterday where they crossed."
"259550","262110"," So we'll see if we can get this breakdown below. "
"262430","265630"," If this gap gets filled down here, we should get some nice fat squeezing."
"267290","268990"," Something right down there, right?"
"269650","273130"," That should lead to a decent squeeze in the spot."
"274850","276990"," I'm long calls right now just as it heads up. "
"276990","279090"," I think we squeezed the 3810."
"284780","290900"," 3D3s are now up to $1.47. I'm going to put some stops in here."
"298070","300830"," I'm going to stop at $1.40 on 3D3s. "
"306390","308570"," That doesn't mean you trade to 383."
"308650","309830"," It means you trade to 381."
"310470","311770"," You're just looking for the print on it. "
"312490","317710"," Changing my stops now to $1.50. Making some fat money here."
"328790","330770"," This is where these huge buyers stepped in here."
"331930","333430"," So you can see it right in here. "
"336960","338580"," Stepped in with calls as well."
"339460","344760"," They bought real money buyers and they were options buyers at the same time."
"345660","347040"," 380c's are now up to $3. "
"348180","350220"," On the day those are up, 350%."
"350840","352980"," They started out the day at like 80 cents."
"352980","357580"," I think not the day but we started actually moving up, confirmed moving up. "
"357800","359540"," They're around 80 cents now, $3."
"360260","365060"," Those are for the first banging calls."
"366220","371540"," June 30th, 380c's are at $1.75. They were worth pennies this morning. "
"373200","374620"," So just cranking, making money."
"375020","375860"," Good day to be making money."
"376080","377600"," Second day of making money. "
"378140","380140"," Lost money on some overnight calls."
"381560","382960"," But it doesn't matter."
"383100","384180"," They're raised now. "
"384440","386140"," The kick ass money making right now."
"387120","389440"," Trading higher to the trap buyer zone."
"390740","392580"," A little bit of a bid in the VIX currently. "
"393860","395740"," We'll get rid of this trap buyers now."
"396000","396920"," We know that they're there."
"397160","399180"," We know this is the point right here. "
"399480","401860"," We got a little bit of a tweezer movement here."
"402300","403640"," This is usually signs of reversal."
"404000","405220"," You can take profit at this point. "
"405780","408520"," I'm going to probably end up tagging profit here in just a second."
"408520","412200"," It hasn't quite hit yet, but we'll see."
"414220","416380"," Probably going to, we'll see if I get tagged out of this. "
"417500","419360"," I'll just be conscious of this tweezer movement."
"419740","420360"," Usually sign of reversal."
"421240","423480"," Might see us come back down and test this channel to move back up. "
"424300","425340"," We'll find out real soon."
"426220","427820"," I made some, made it for some quick money on that trade."
"427940","428660"," There's a good trade right here. "
"434890","436270"," Tweezer movement on the VIX as well."
"437190","437670"," Yep, there I go."
"437770","438590"," I just, I just tagged out. "
"444360","445880"," That was a quick nice movement."
"446860","447500"," That was really nice."
"448880","449640"," I like it. "
"453320","462020"," I'll put that box back up here so we can see what the, what the end day target is above"
"462020","462300"," here."
"469380","470800"," I really does a better job, right?"
"471200","472600"," Yellow and green, I guess, instead of red."
"473500","474900"," Green light, yellow light, stop light. "
"480340","481700"," Also didn't get a new high."
"481700","483240"," Notice that one, 380-63."
"483880","485140"," Did not get the new high. "
"486080","490120"," I'm going to assume that all these trap, trap buyers are selling out right now."
"490180","491860"," We'll see if we get regained support."
"492860","495880"," I'm going to put another, this is the end messy now. "
"497960","499500"," I'm going to move this one."
"499760","502300"," I'm going to move up where we got 378-70."
"505820","506940"," So we're going to move this box. "
"507240","508000"," Oh, hold on a second here."
"512169","513049"," 378-70."
"516659","517539"," Right about here. "
"519820","521280"," I'll move this up the VWAP."
"535550","538330"," We're going to see if this thing still has some legs on it or not."
"544350","545450"," There it is right there. "
"557030","558990"," All right, just, I'm going to buy 30."
"565220","566120"," I bought some more."
"566380","568560"," I want to see us, I want to see us trade this 381. "
"569000","569860"," I want to see this hit."
"570600","571620"," So I'm backing some calls again."
"574110","575430"," It's dangerous trade without a doubt. "
"580720","582960"," I know where I can buy more right down here."
"583320","585940"," I know what this is my, this is it right here."
"586480","587440"," This trend line, right?"
"593680","594520"," How y'all doing?"
"598500","599900"," Look up on your own. "
"600040","602860"," Just got to invest the P.D. You can look up tweezers."
"603580","605120"," Just go up tweezer and I'll tell you more."
"607990","609790"," Good to see you in the chat there, James Rowland. "
"610390","611830"," Another day of making money."
"621550","622570"," Good to see you brother."
"627900","630800"," No, so this is a, this move right here. "
"631120","634020"," This was at one, this was at one 15 when I came back from break."
"634720","636000"," This move is giant."
"636880","638420"," This is a huge move. "
"638920","640240"," It's a 30 point move right here."
"640820","641220"," Monster."
"641780","643600"," This is another monster move right here. "
"644820","646080"," This channel, right?"
"646700","649900"," This recovery and move up is a sign of bullishness, right?"
"650660","655920"," When we dropped, when we readily reversed down here, we, we watched the options chain."
"656840","660720"," A bunch of buyers stepped in on the options chain and in real money buying."
"661260","663940"," So we had those two indicators here, right?"
"664380","666820"," Now we have to wash out these trap buyers here. "
"666920","668540"," We had just deleted this a few minutes ago."
"668980","672200"," We have to wash out these trap buyers here and watch for a move higher."
"675070","678110"," We also have a gap to fill in the VIX down below. "
"678470","684030"," So if you're watching the VIX real quick, this yellow area is a big giant fucking gap that needs to"
"684030","684370"," be filled."
"684550","686630"," That means down, not up on the VIX."
"688210","690710"," Let's take a walk around the market and see what's going on. "
"690930","694710"," We'll take a look at other smaller small."
"695050","697050"," Let's take a look at XLK as an example."
"698010","699730"," Consolidation right here in XLK, right?"
"700090","701570"," We knew about this earlier today. "
"702010","704190"," We knew that we would try to refill this gap."
"704190","704650"," We did."
"705350","706090"," You're now seeing consolidation. "
"706690","707130"," This is bullish."
"707890","708530"," Believe it or not."
"709270","710670"," XLF, same thing, right?"
"710890","711790"," Came up, closed the gap. "
"712230","713570"," Now we're looking for some consolidation."
"713930","715790"," We'll actually now the draw the line in down below."
"716370","717570"," Make sure that shit is white. "
"718550","720470"," And we'll make sure that shit is not dotted."
"721290","722990"," We'll make sure it's a thick ass."
"723390","724410"," Why did you pick our size?"
"724810","725230"," There you go. "
"725890","727090"," Thick ass size on it."
"727930","728530"," Just like that."
"729050","731750"," It's bullish, right?"
"732730","734110"," XLE, not doing so well. "
"734250","737990"," We know that XLE recovery, we know that XLE should help and not help, right?"
"737990","741030"," And XLF and XLK are looking bullish."
"741290","741970"," It's helpful, right?"
"742270","743130"," Look at XLV."
"743410","744990"," Monster moves and XLV. "
"745550","746230"," Monster moves."
"746870","749110"," Talked about this earlier today being a big bull flag."
"749590","751690"," Just crank in XLV right now. "
"752270","752830"," Smashing."
"754170","755370"," XLRE, same thing."
"755930","757210"," XLR, same thing. "
"757670","759870"," XLB, eh, that is good as we expect."
"760230","762510"," But XLB has a gap to fill."
"763530","765770"," XLB is still showing a bull flag now. "
"765770","768050"," It's starting to form a big bull flag, right?"
"768530","769530"," It's pretty nice, actually."
"769690","770390"," I like this right here."
"771690","772570"," I don't know. "
"772830","773310"," I kind of like it."
"773670","776190"," I would like to see it come down a little bit more than snap that gap."
"777030","778210"," One more quick push up higher. "
"780150","782770"," Look at that break right now going on the VIX."
"783150","785070"," VIX can break this core cross from yesterday."
"785850","787870"," There's going to be a huge push for the spy. "
"788550","789610"," So we're going to see what's going on here."
"790070","793030"," So we can get that oomph in here and crank up 381."
"793750","798150"," There are the sellers above 384, 3846. "
"799390","801410"," They're hiding up in here right now, right?"
"801970","805190"," They're sneaking around up in here trying to tell you no."
"805570","806630"," We do have a gap to fill."
"806870","808610"," So it could be a nice fat squeeze coming up. "
"808710","809250"," We'll see what happens."
"813620","814660"," Hey Brad, how are you doing, brother?"
"819710","820370"," Good to see you, man."
"825800","826520"," Oh, yeah. "
"833350","833930"," Oh, yeah."
"834070","834750"," Got a break now."
"835110","836930"," Got a break now of..."
"836930","839070"," Yeah, we got a break going on of the..."
"839070","842570"," a little bit more quick room. "
"843130","844510"," Yeah, we're fine right now."
"860480","861600"," See what's going on here."
"865790","866490"," We're going to..."
"866490","868050"," Nope, we're going to take this one right here. "
"868350","869710"," We're going to turn this one white."
"870830","871650"," Make it small."
"881450","883190"," See if that one holds up or not. "
"885250","885790"," It breaks through."
"891030","892510"," I would love some watermelon."
"893130","894730"," Thank you, Levy. "
"895290","895650"," One's plenty."
"896670","896950"," Thank you."
"898650","899490"," Sorry about that. "
"899530","899710"," Hold on."
"900830","902230"," I'm going to mute this real quick way."
"902350","902950"," Pound to watermelon. "
"945820","947860"," A lot of pressure right now in the market."
"948040","949320"," See how these red balls right now."
"952270","953850"," A lot of pressure coming into the market. "
"953850","960210"," The VIX keeps dropping."
"964200","965720"," I'll bring up the VIX real quick again."
"982080","984020"," See if we can start to break through right here. "
"984180","988020"," If we can get a break right here and start to fill this gap, see if we can get a"
"988020","988660"," break right here."
"1008960","1010700"," Totally silently pounding the watermelon."
"1012400","1012980"," Oh, yeah. "
"1013960","1015320"," Paul Siskas, bring it up."
"1017340","1017740"," TLT."
"1026339","1030079"," If you buy your two bills, you better be buying your fucking TLT as well. "
"1030760","1032920"," Nice fat long leaps on TLT."
"1037800","1038900"," Let's push this up."
"1040980","1042119"," Don't fail me now. "
"1046170","1047569"," I try to make it fail for sure."
"1049370","1050710"," They don't want to see 381."
"1052450","1054870"," Brad, today I haven't had bourbon in a while. "
"1056190","1059330"," So we're having cocktails today leading up into 4th of July."
"1059470","1060970"," So Chair, are you joining us right now?"
"1062710","1063970"," Well, having 4th of July."
"1064190","1065290"," Chair, is there anybody out there?"
"1071480","1075200"," So the U.S. has Chinese actions undermining freedoms in Hong Kong right now. "
"1075200","1078080"," That's U.S. saying that Chinese actions are undermining freedoms in Hong Kong."
"1078080","1079800"," I'm trading all zero dates, one dates, two dates."
"1080380","1081920"," I guess we're as we're leading it in the weekend now. "
"1082100","1084660"," But I'm still trading on July 1st."
"1085320","1085560"," Options."
"1086660","1093640"," They've had like the safest win-to-loss ratio for me this week specifically. "
"1094540","1095440"," Deltas have been better."
"1096580","1097680"," So I'm on 383Cs."
"1098900","1103300"," Now they're now $1.53. They're just cranking right now. "
"1103420","1104860"," I'm just fucking plumbing away."
"1105040","1112220"," Move my limit of this $1.40. Hold on."
"1112300","1112920"," I fucked that up. "
"1113360","1115240"," Sometimes I fucking, sometimes I put the shit in it."
"1115360","1117740"," It doesn't actually go through scams on me."
"1122160","1128240"," The big bids in on 380C on July 1st and July 30th. "
"1128240","1130880"," Price target above is 381 tentatively."
"1131280","1134500"," Hopefully get a squeeze into the close to 383."
"1135160","1136800"," We always hope to have that stuff. "
"1137180","1137820"," Oh, I tagged out."
"1138580","1138880"," Okay."
"1140900","1141660"," We got told though. "
"1143780","1144500"," That's okay."
"1144640","1146220"," I made a quick, quick 20 cents."
"1146820","1147240"," I'll take it. "
"1149160","1150500"," I'll take the 20 cents."
"1150500","1159720"," Let's see whether you're versatile in the VIX right now."
"1160720","1162540"," VIX is like, I don't want to close the rest of that gap. "
"1164820","1166240"," You're not getting that gap closure."
"1171120","1175680"," So if we do get any failure here, where are we looking for, right?"
"1176760","1178620"," For a dip to buy."
"1178940","1181420"," If you have not anything right now, you're looking for a dip to buy. "
"1181420","1184320"," I want you to see this orange line left inside of a screen."
"1184740","1185140"," Watch my cursor."
"1185560","1186640"," There's a V-wop right here. "
"1187400","1190640"," I want you to see down below where this V-wop is, right?"
"1191020","1192380"," See this red line that shows up."
"1193460","1195640"," I'll show you sellers that are renting it right now."
"1196380","1198260"," It's some pressure on the market. "
"1198800","1200080"," So you watch my cursor on the left now."
"1200620","1203560"," We're going to look for this, for this little tiny white line to break."
"1204300","1207340"," And then again, this little yellow line right here to break. "
"1207640","1210360"," If it breaks, we know where the buy zone is down below."
"1211260","1212480"," So we're looking for that."
"1212660","1213140"," Look down here. "
"1213200","1215620"," You can see the sellers in force coming in right now."
"1215920","1217320"," The circle that I'm making right now."
"1217340","1218680"," So there's a little bit of risk right here. "
"1219580","1221680"," And the VIX is catching a bid right now."
"1221740","1223100"," So we're going to pay attention to this."
"1224020","1225980"," We'll stop down to some calls earlier. "
"1226720","1228120"," So we'll see what happens here."
"1228320","1231140"," I don't look small on the screen, but this is a fucking beautiful move."
"1231560","1233320"," And this is a beautiful move right here too. "
"1241190","1242350"," Some paying attention here."
"1242790","1244670"," Lots of spy buyers stepping in as well."
"1244670","1245310"," What was that?"
"1248400","1248760"," 207?"
"1249160","1249560"," Yeah, you know what?"
"1249740","1250620"," I think I'm going to buy somewhere. "
"1250840","1251960"," I'm going to jump back in again."
"1252940","1254600"," I'm going to make this smaller though."
"1254680","1256060"," I'm only going to go with 25 contracts. "
"1258820","1260560"," I'm going to be looking to buy a 383."
"1261080","1262920"," Let me see if I can get a decent price on this."
"1263940","1264260"," Okay. "
"1264580","1267200"," So $30.29. I'm going to look to see."
"1268100","1268720"," Watch my cursor."
"1269080","1269820"," Watch the cursor. "
"1270720","1272980"," I might actually make it more than 25 contracts right now."
"1272980","1277350"," It's going to be delicious."
"1278830","1285590"," Let's take a look here and see where support is. "
"1286130","1295940"," 377.95. Man, right here to 377.95 right here."
"1297560","1297820"," Right here."
"1299280","1301520"," 77.95. What's this?"
"1302120","1307920"," 378.03. 370.03. I really want this. "
"1311740","1321290"," I'm going to bring this over 370.03. Right here, 378 "
"1321290","1329320",".54. Right there."
"1333400","1335420"," I want this bad."
"1347140","1348240"," There we go. "
"1348420","1349100"," Another pincer move."
"1355040","1356180"," Real bad."
"1356180","1356880"," I want that trade. "
"1365470","1367390"," All right."
"1368750","1381260"," It's $1.36. Some in for $1.36. It's"
"1381260","1381440"," dangerous."
"1382280","1383580"," Just see if the head's up. "
"1389260","1391660"," Nice calls coming in the queues right now."
"1392180","1394240"," Nice calls coming in in the spy right now."
"1400520","1402280"," It's not really showing up here. "
"1403040","1405820"," 380.57. Yeah, I think we're squeezing."
"1407360","1408560"," Keep going, baby."
"1409420","1410040"," Keep pushing. "
"1411860","1412640"," Do daddy."
"1413080","1413420"," Do it."
"1414120","1414560"," Do it. "
"1416220","1416880"," Push up."
"1428750","1431270"," Let's make sure the stuff's still on here."
"1440040","1441140"," I haven't heard any news. "
"1452650","1455410"," Right now I've got no stop loss on this trade."
"1455750","1456530"," So I didn't move higher."
"1456750","1460650"," So right now I'm looking for a break of this yellow trend line right here. "
"1461710","1464990"," If I don't break this trend line, I'm going to stay in the trade."
"1466110","1468590"," I might even buy slightly lower here."
"1468890","1472250"," I really want to see some capitulation to not be trading this. "
"1472690","1474950"," But when we start moving up, I'll put a stop loss on it."
"1475050","1478870"," So what I'll do is manually get out of the trade if we start to fail here."
"1479310","1480730"," We commonly do fail here. "
"1480850","1483130"," I'm not saying I think that we do fail here oftentimes."
"1484870","1486550"," So I have my finger on the trigger to sell."
"1487450","1489290"," That's the only way that you can do this right now. "
"1489290","1492030"," We'll stun this a little bit farther."
"1493090","1494650"," Right now it's maintaining trend."
"1495470","1497310"," So I'm not as concerned right now. "
"1504560","1505740"," But still sellers."
"1505960","1507000"," Still sellers coming in."
"1508060","1509500"," Sellers are there for sure. "
"1521010","1522110"," So we'll see what happens here."
"1531670","1534210"," Well, I think I've been stopped out twice today."
"1535210","1540950"," Games, big gains on both, but I unrealized gains are much larger. "
"1583570","1585600"," Give me that big money, baby."
"1586920","1588600"," Give me that big money."
"1594710","1600290"," If you're just joining us, if you're new to the stream and it's lagging for you in time, always"
"1600290","1609130"," remember to go back to the cog in the description of the video and you'll click on that cog and"
"1609130","1610310"," you can speed up the video. "
"1610630","1612770"," It should be a then be in real time."
"1612950","1616730"," YouTube delays the videos by up to 15 seconds."
"1617310","1618250"," I'll sound like a weirdo. "
"1618530","1620330"," Just increase the playback speed."
"1620530","1622110"," It'll eventually become normal again."
"1623250","1624250"," I'll sound like a weirdo. "
"1624330","1626370"," And then you'll have me in real time if you're trying to trade along with me."
"1630020","1630940"," This is up."
"1631080","1632900"," I think we've streamed today as a row here. "
"1632960","1634020"," We've been making money both days."
"1635420","1636060"," Serious money."
"1637000","1638900"," 300, 200, 300 percent each day. "
"1643350","1645670"," And I'll be here live streaming tomorrow with you as well."
"1646430","1649310"," I'm going to try to be live streaming a little bit more frequently than I have been."
"1649830","1653250"," I haven't gone into too much detail as to why I have not been live streaming. "
"1653250","1660050"," There's more to do with time available and the time, the cost to me and all that kind of stuff."
"1662570","1665510"," And I'm going to do a bunch of renovations and stupid shit like that."
"1666210","1667110"," But my wife's yelling at me. "
"1667190","1668070"," She doesn't mean to do it hard work."
"1668510","1668990"," She loves me."
"1669870","1670990"," She'll have to do less work. "
"1672330","1674010"," So no more work in my house."
"1676110","1679590"," Although I did wake up this morning before I would do some house work."
"1682050","1684050"," But she cuddled me, which was kind of nice. "
"1684950","1686170"," It's weird how that happened."
"1686350","1687430"," That interplay was weird."
"1688210","1689570"," So I'm still sitting here in some calls. "
"1691290","1692870"," Price talking about 381."
"1693910","1695490"," 3D3 was up there earlier."
"1695670","1696870"," It's not showing itself now. "
"1697430","1699270"," Supply is coming down at this point."
"1700590","1701070"," 38050."
"1702290","1703950"," It's the teal of this one right here. "
"1704310","1704790"," 38040."
"1705470","1706570"," So might raise that up."
"1706570","1709090"," Now this was, this was trapped sellers. "
"1709930","1711370"," So it's raised up a little bit."
"1712450","1713910"," This price target above."
"1714410","1721400"," See if we can, I don't know how to make it smaller right now. "
"1726940","1727980"," 382 ish."
"1728320","1729660"," It's come down a little bit."
"1730120","1734400"," Price targets above is still this 383. "
"1735600","1737120"," Still the price target above here."
"1739400","1742540"," But we're going to rate, we're going to lower this down because you can kind of see this here."
"1742760","1743440"," 382 12. "
"1745640","1746640"," 3827 right here."
"1746800","1747840"," Somewhere in here for right now."
"1748940","1750340"," 381 is the start of it. "
"1751260","1752720"," 3845 we have right here."
"1753540","1754660"," This was trapped sellers."
"1755060","1756080"," The next level we'll be looking for. "
"1758680","1764940"," You know, one of the things that I'll do here when we're trading is that I'm not watching real-time"
"1764940","1769100"," like market news, which I should be."
"1769600","1771060"," Vix is catching a bit again."
"1775160","1776600"," Yeah, I'll be here next week, bro. "
"1780940","1781960"," You guys like making money?"
"1785890","1786910"," You strapped in?"
"1787290","1787930"," Hells, yes."
"1791770","1795270"," Yeah, I'm still, I'm still, we're just sitting here waiting to see what's going to happen."
"1795830","1797230"," Time's starting to waste, which is good. "
"1797310","1803590"," It's 219 in the afternoon."
"1804470","1805690"," Now it is in the quarter."
"1806370","1808110"," So you could get more power hour. "
"1808390","1809430"," I'll be here with you, brother."
"1810390","1812030"," Dude, I love all you."
"1812110","1813550"," I want you all you guys to know out there. "
"1813650","1814610"," I want to win in men."
"1814710","1815470"," I don't care who you are."
"1815570","1816030"," I'll give you them. "
"1816410","1817270"," Okay, identify yourself."
"1818230","1819370"," I love making money."
"1819690","1821550"," And I love making money with you guys too. "
"1822030","1823870"," I want you guys to all know that out there."
"1824610","1827270"," Don't be listening to fucking Twitter faders and all that kind of shit."
"1827690","1829110"," Those guys don't trade, dude. "
"1829250","1829810"," I promise you."
"1830290","1831310"," 100 fucking percent."
"1831930","1832650"," They don't trade. "
"1832650","1834490"," I know they don't fucking trade."
"1835130","1836150"," They bitch and moan."
"1836450","1840550"," Dude, I don't have the time to be on fucking Twitter all day long. "
"1841190","1843370"," Fucking read everybody's posts and all that kind of stupid shit."
"1844410","1846090"," I don't know how they would have the time."
"1846430","1848110"," That goes a lot for the sub sellers too. "
"1848250","1853410"," You can't, you can't, if you're like honestly that person, it's so much work involved in that"
"1853410","1853670"," stuff."
"1854170","1861830"," There's no fucking way that you're fucking GI fucking Joe and fucking GI husband and GI wife and GI"
"1861830","1867070"," fucking Twitter commenter and fucking all that stupid nonsense."
"1869010","1870190"," I'm not going to go into a rant. "
"1870750","1871330"," I will later."
"1871590","1873290"," But other time I did it yesterday."
"1873590","1873830"," Plenty. "
"1874710","1876370"," I spoke my piece yesterday."
"1877950","1879170"," So yeah, I'll be here for you guys."
"1879290","1880270"," I feel bad when I'm not here. "
"1880910","1889710"," I'll train with you guys because you got it's tough to comment on Twitter about the trades that"
"1889710","1892850"," you're in, how you're getting out of trades, how you're getting long in the trades, short in the"
"1892850","1893210"," trades."
"1894010","1894870"," That kind of stuff."
"1895050","1901030"," It's hard to show the hindsight trading that people always question or people always on Twitter"
"1901030","1905790"," specifically being like this is bad or that's bad or whatever, but they don't trade. "
"1906930","1909990"," There's no way to get on Twitter and be like do this, do that, do this, do that."
"1910270","1911810"," We're here right now doing it every day."
"1912010","1912850"," We do it live right now. "
"1912930","1913630"," We did it live yesterday."
"1914730","1916010"," Yesterday was a sideways trading day."
"1916010","1918150"," We made just as much money yesterday as today. "
"1919350","1921150"," It doesn't matter if it's going up or going down."
"1921290","1921710"," We'll make money."
"1923710","1925150"," So I'll be here Wednesday. "
"1925290","1927750"," I promise I'll be here at some point on Wednesday."
"1929010","1929410"," Tuesday."
"1929770","1930790"," I can't guarantee it. "
"1930950","1931490"," Wednesday, I promise."
"1932390","1934810"," Oh, I'm still sitting here in these fucking calls."
"1937350","1938790"," We're not doing anything right now. "
"1944610","1947550"," I feel like I just want to get out of these calls and just wait."
"1949490","1952610"," And then we get a fucking explosive move either way."
"1953650","1955110"," I might get out of them. "
"1956790","1958370"," I'm being lazy here."
"1961450","1963170"," I'm being totally fucking lazy."
"1963890","1964610"," Don't want the move. "
"1966030","1968470"," I don't want the sitting around here fucking around."
"1973970","1975790"," I'm not pulling the plug just yet."
"1976710","1978950"," I'm going to pull the plug at some point here. "
"1978950","1980430"," Next like three to five minutes."
"1986260","1989100"," So we've got 40 minutes left until power hour."
"1989260","1989800"," Let's talk about that. "
"1989840","1991460"," I was talking about that when I got out of the tangent."
"1991840","1995360"," So power hour most days of the week we know it's sell."
"1999060","2000720"," Today, it's end of quarter. "
"2001320","2003080"," We're going to expect to squeeze up higher."
"2003900","2008340"," Trainer psychology says that people will take it long to squeeze the close."
"2009380","2010980"," Does that happen end of quarter?"
"2011800","2014060"," We have this one other thing to talk about here. "
"2014360","2017020"," We've been referencing referencing this all day long."
"2017780","2019520"," We're going to look back on it right now again."
"2020700","2023060"," So you have and there's some key things. "
"2023240","2024700"," Another key thing I want to talk about here."
"2025180","2027400"," You have all these puts expiring."
"2027600","2030660"," Most of the fuel from that's probably already taking place today. "
"2031240","2034620"," Give a little bit of a bump again for the first on Friday."
"2036880","2041320"," Tomorrow, you might get a little bit of a little bit of like cocaine fueled run."
"2041660","2042440"," Not as good. "
"2043320","2047120"," The question becomes, have we ran out of fuel for the rest of today or not?"
"2048080","2053199"," If we sell off into the closed though, right at 3 p.m. If we were to sell off into"
"2053199","2058460"," the closed, I would expect some fuel tomorrow or overnight as we grow closer."
"2058699","2064000"," Now, on this same chart, I want you to pay attention to July 15th."
"2064179","2067360"," You saw those spy and Tesla puts come in today, right?"
"2068260","2071179"," Now, it's going to add to this put pile here in 715. "
"2071840","2073900"," Now, you see this wasn't as bad."
"2074020","2074840"," We still went down."
"2075000","2077239"," There's a fair chance we're going to trade down into that date. "
"2078280","2079340"," We can have a run."
"2080100","2082900"," I want you to look at this unless something else changes in the future, right?"
"2083060","2088000"," This map will change or this chart will change, but we could have a run into September."
"2088960","2094880"," But with this sitting here, right, we could trade down into that in early July or trade down into"
"2094880","2096620"," this after mid-July. "
"2097120","2099180"," Just keep this on your plate as we go forward."
"2099920","2107300"," That you could possibly end up, you could possibly end up looking for re-hedging again into July,"
"2107680","2110600"," either early for a target of early July or late July."
"2110800","2117620"," That would mean you would buy some putback spreads dated for mid-August ratio spreads mid-August"
"2118340","2119140"," for lower lows. "
"2119540","2121380"," We talked about the weekly moving average."
"2121380","2123960"," We know that it's down at 350 zone."
"2124380","2132160"," We've talked specifically and posted a nauseam of some trades against Tesla, trades against Apple,"
"2132420","2139680"," trades against trades against Apple, Tesla, and spy heading into the month of July. "
"2140300","2143960"," Just be conscious of that as we head into, oh my God, this rent."
"2144960","2147380"," Move this up higher so you can see where we're at."
"2147380","2150840"," See the VWAP down below coming up to this big green buy box. "
"2152640","2159380"," So the key being is that you need to be strategically looking towards pay."
"2160280","2161240"," We're at end of quarter, right?"
"2161500","2164460"," You as an investor, a trader, or a bear, whatever it is you are."
"2164940","2169500"," As an abomitable snowman, whatever you are out there, it doesn't matter. "
"2169760","2173660"," So even though we're at 380 and you think, yeah, this is huge."
"2173660","2179740"," I want you to know that more than likely the put wall is going to, like they said this morning,"
"2179740","2187100"," the put wall is going to move from 370 probably down to 360 and can probably move lower to 350"
"2187100","2188100"," or even lower."
"2188540","2191860"," I want you to be aware of that as we come into July. "
"2192780","2196680"," I want you to be aware that you can put some putback spreads on to 350 or even lower."
"2197200","2203640"," If we test 350 or if we test lower 320, those will pay dividends for you."
"2203640","2209400"," Let's say we're a break of the market in July and you had some 320s. "
"2209880","2212820"," They would pay stupid money even here at 380."
"2213760","2216460"," Even if we train up to 400, they're going to pay stupid money."
"2216700","2224140"," So just consider that in the coming week from now into, let's say, the first week of July of"
"2224140","2225700"," putting on a hedge. "
"2226300","2231940"," Now, if you were to just buy fucking puts for fucking mid-August, I would highly not recommend"
"2231940","2232300"," that."
"2233520","2240600"," But if you put some putback spreads on, some ratio spreads, and we do continue to trade down into"
"2240600","2248440"," July or end of July, and you dated them into August so that you could pass that bag off to"
"2248440","2252140"," someone else, I would consider that if I were you."
"2252880","2256900"," And that way, when you trade, if we trade down there, you could hand them up. "
"2256900","2260900"," Also know those trades either make you a tiny bit of money."
"2261220","2263660"," If we go up, they make a ton of money."
"2263660","2269980"," If we go down, they cost at the end, the end net is you don't lose anything. "
"2271040","2275880"," Unless we're a trade sideways, but we know we haven't been trading sideways since January 1."
"2276380","2278240"," So they eventually print pretty decent."
"2279540","2281060"," Make sure you have those on."
"2281440","2286880"," So if you do lose money, trade, and if you do lose money, day trade or whatever that you have,"
"2286880","2288600"," you have some way to recover. "
"2289720","2292300"," Oh, yeah, we got a nice squeeze right back."
"2293960","2296040"," Nice squeeze, nice buyer stepping in."
"2296380","2297380"," I'm still wrong, by the way. "
"2297500","2298180"," I haven't touched anything."
"2299060","2300000"," So I'm still wrong."
"2302340","2304760"," Haven't sold anything now on this trade. "
"2304920","2306260"," I haven't sold in this trade right here."
"2306340","2307340"," Not this one's done."
"2307880","2309460"," This trade right here, I haven't touched a thing. "
"2313740","2318810"," So I'm still sitting here waiting to see what happens at the end of the day."
"2320630","2324490"," I think we do squeeze up or my take is that we squeeze up into the close."
"2326510","2330170"," I don't want to miss the squeeze higher at this point. "
"2330450","2333390"," I'm not willing to cut losses unless we break the UOP maybe."
"2334090","2335570"," We break the UOP something like that."
"2337630","2339930"," I'm looking at VIX right now. "
"2340090","2342590"," VIX looks bearish to me, not bullish."
"2343730","2346290"," This looks like another break lower into the close."
"2347390","2351030"," We'll take a walk around the neighborhood and see what's going on. "
"2353170","2353650"," XLK."
"2354130","2356510"," This is all nice right here watching this stuff right here."
"2357130","2360910"," This looks like it's forming some kind of a base for a move into the close. "
"2361750","2363890"," It can look bearish to some people I guess."
"2364910","2368710"," I'd be looking to buy this V-WOP line if we trade down here at any point."
"2370850","2372030"," Same area right?"
"2372310","2374850"," We were we were we're trying this early this morning, right?"
"2375070","2376730"," We knew where it was coming early this morning. "
"2377750","2379770"," XLE is falling off right now."
"2380370","2384410"," I do want to buy XLE at 65 if I can."
"2384910","2387370"," I was in an XLE trade into Tuesday. "
"2388530","2390170"," I think it was end of day Tuesday."
"2390450","2390830"," It could be wrong."
"2390970","2391910"," It was end of Tuesday. "
"2391910","2393390"," I sold that sold that trade."
"2395430","2397610"," And yeah, so this is Monday, right?"
"2398510","2400030"," I sold this right here."
"2400490","2401430"," I got greedy like on. "
"2401730","2404030"," No, this is Monday, Tuesday went."
"2404190","2404710"," No, this is that this."
"2404930","2406110"," No, I sold this trade right here. "
"2406650","2407370"," I sold it right here."
"2408390","2410010"," I wish I had held it here and it didn't."
"2410310","2410350"," Whatever. "
"2410750","2411010"," Fuck it."
"2411690","2419530"," It's been trading lower since I think last week I gave you a price target of $65 down down down"
"2419530","2420150"," way down here."
"2420270","2420830"," It's five bucks. "
"2422670","2426390"," So we'll see if it affects all he gets there to 65 bucks."
"2429130","2430090"," XLV beautiful."
"2431550","2432790"," Absolutely stunning and gorgeous. "
"2434350","2437710"," Same thing going on with XLRE another good day."
"2437850","2439050"," I wouldn't take this trade personally."
"2439470","2440070"," I don't like the XL. "
"2440310","2441930"," I don't like real estate trades right now."
"2442310","2443230"," I'm in real estate."
"2443610","2444270"," No fucking way. "
"2445470","2445950"," XLI."
"2446630","2449390"," I like XLI, but not as much as XLB."
"2455010","2456730"," I like XLB here, man. "
"2456850","2458250"," This is so setting up."
"2458670","2459350"," This is gorgeous."
"2459750","2461310"," This is remember hindsight trading. "
"2461890","2462630"," I'm going to tell you about hindsight."
"2462990","2464210"," This is not hindsight trading."
"2464610","2465950"," I love this trade right here. "
"2465950","2466750"," It's a great trade."
"2469430","2471290"," Oh, I like that trade too."
"2471490","2471970"," XLY. "
"2472750","2474190"," That one's looking tea."
"2474390","2475250"," That's teasing me too."
"2476070","2477410"," I feel like XLY here. "
"2478630","2479070"," XLP."
"2479450","2479870"," Yeah."
"2480890","2481330"," XLU. "
"2481670","2482710"," It broke above."
"2483030","2483430"," This is bullish."
"2484450","2487070"," And DX forming some kind of a base. "
"2487510","2488990"," We don't want to see this right here."
"2489010","2491230"," We don't want to see this kind of a move right here, do we?"
"2491610","2493690"," This has been our story, right?"
"2494550","2495770"," Consolidate boom drop."
"2497090","2499090"," Consolidate boom drop into the clothes. "
"2499710","2501270"," That's some nasty shit right there."
"2501410","2503290"," That's the difference between a bull market and a bear market."
"2503790","2507990"," Every time I get some consolidation, we fucking boom straight back down. "
"2508830","2515050"," In the corner, I'm going to roll the dice and say we go up here into the bell, and even"
"2515050","2516310"," possibly in the early next week."
"2516870","2517430"," It's possible."
"2518070","2519510"," I want to say I'm going to close that up. "
"2521930","2522990"," Take a look at IWM."
"2523750","2524090"," Oh, God."
"2524390","2525290"," I don't even want to look at IWM. "
"2526490","2528110"," I love IWM right now."
"2529170","2530690"," You can see this yesterday, right?"
"2531030","2532210"," How this came into play yesterday."
"2532210","2534730"," We ended up selling this direct off. "
"2535710","2537050"," You see some nastiness."
"2537510","2539570"," It's 2.30. We're going to talk about this real quick too."
"2540350","2546970"," So, you know, yesterday, if you play the game as they're playing it, what are you going to see,"
"2547150","2547190"," right?"
"2547310","2549450"," You're going to see him in here and boom, he come down here. "
"2549630","2552950"," Can you buy that though and make your money back during the day, possibly?"
"2553870","2561110"," I'm going to still take this risk once again into the clothes for tomorrow or at least close today."
"2561110","2563630"," If we trade a pair today, if we were to trade."
"2564810","2565610"," If today. "
"2568290","2569250"," So, no, I make stuff."
"2569350","2570290"," We trade a crude oil."
"2570470","2576450"," It's just $1.05. $1.76. The barrel is down $4.02 or $3.66 percent. "
"2576990","2577770"," Normal market."
"2578070","2581190"," This would be very bullish and a move higher and a breakout of this channel."
"2583410","2584150"," It's possible. "
"2584510","2585130"," It's possible though."
"2585290","2585430"," We did."
"2585570","2586250"," We break out of that. "
"2586330","2586750"," We hit this."
"2587050","2590950"," We break out of this overnight and then roll it down into 4th of July."
"2590950","2592990"," That makes sense too because everyone wants out of the market. "
"2592990","2596890"," I make gasoline in July futures set to a $3.64 a gallon."
"2597170","2597750"," Be aware."
"2598350","2602870"," I want you to be aware that people close themselves out on Friday and to 4th of July tomorrow. "
"2603570","2606230"," I would expect weakness into the clothes tomorrow at some point."
"2606410","2607130"," We make it three days."
"2607590","2609970"," It's just set to a $3.89 a gallon. "
"2610290","2611250"," That could pump it up."
"2611570","2612250"," That happens too."
"2614430","2616450"," So, you have to think about all these things as we move forward. "
"2617210","2619930"," My trade for today though for the end of the day is this move right here."
"2619930","2620750"," Right into that close."
"2621130","2621890"," I want to see that close. "
"2622110","2623110"," That strong window dressing."
"2623890","2625110"," That end of quarter close."
"2625510","2627030"," You want to see it tomorrow into the close. "
"2627950","2628910"," That's what I'm looking for."
"2631550","2634950"," So, we're sitting here in that same fucking line right here."
"2636290","2637350"," Same fucking line. "
"2637450","2638630"," Let's look above and see if any more."
"2639890","2644710"," It's at $3.393. I don't think we get there though."
"2647250","2650050"," We have some runway running out as we get into the bell as well. "
"2650530","2652990"," It's $2.33 half an hour left to the end of the day."
"2654950","2657630"," I don't hate taking longs into the day."
"2659610","2660930"," Once we hit power hour. "
"2662770","2664370"," As bulls, we flinch."
"2665450","2667670"," Whenever we come into power hour, fuck that."
"2667830","2668250"," I'm out of here. "
"2689160","2690620"," Take a look at Tesla right now."
"2690620","2691600"," It's a good place to buy Tesla."
"2693800","2695040"," $6.78 a bounce. "
"2696420","2698980"," Same area of volatility above."
"2701300","2702460"," Probably started above $700."
"2704660","2709740"," Nice little bounce down below $6.78. $6.60 there. "
"2711060","2711860"," $6.50 baby."
"2713780","2715020"," I'm wrong right now."
"2723620","2724180"," Yeah. "
"2724940","2729280"," This chart that I had up of XLE, of oil, not really oil, but XLE."
"2730700","2732560"," I'm a different computer over here."
"2732840","2733620"," I'm going to charge it out. "
"2733900","2738160"," It's $5.42. I don't like oil right now."
"2738520","2739640"," I do like oil."

"2752940","2756300"," I love oil for plastics and lubricants."
"2756780","2761140"," I love it for vehicles that have to work in extreme conditions. "
"2762780","2767240"," But for Joe and Mary on the street, probably not."
"2769340","2773740"," I like gas to an extent too, but that's the one view, right?"
"2773920","2776400"," Then you get the other view of making money."
"2776400","2780380"," I love gas and oil in the long term. "
"2780780","2782040"," I hate it in the short term."
"2782340","2787620"," I think I had a huge argument about this a year ago on Twitter, like a flame war."
"2789040","2795900"," During or two years, whatever Biden was elected, people were like, how can you like oil and gas"
"2795900","2796460"," right now?"
"2797280","2803120"," And I was like, well, I fucking hated it when Republicans were in power because that's going to be"
"2803120","2803320"," cheap. "
"2804520","2810860"," So it's going to get more expensive when Democrats are in power, which is, I know, awkward penguin."
"2811700","2812600"," That's what it is."
"2814140","2817520"," So in terms of making money, I do overall like it's still. "
"2818720","2823120"," Although I think it comes down at least 65 bucks or an XLE at least."
"2824440","2826680"," Kind of what chart you're looking at."
"2826920","2827800"," Lightsweet crude or whatever. "
"2831600","2833800"," Probably going to, I'm going to tag out here, I think."
"2835920","2837580"," I think I'm going to tag out here."
"2837700","2838100"," I'm not sure. "
"2841160","2842420"," I'm going to tag out right here."
"2842600","2844580"," So I think I'm going to tag out of calls."
"2845460","2849200"," I'm going to be looking for a lower dip at B whopper slightly below. "
"2850700","2854760"," I'll be looking for, I want to catch a dip down here."
"2857060","2858060"," Let's take a look here."
"2860700","2865380"," Give me just a second. "
"2865960","2870320"," I want to catch a dip."
"2872620","2874400"," I'm tired of sitting here in this consolidation."
"2874780","2876360"," I want to be fucking around this stuff. "
"2879530","2882970"," Yeah, I want to catch this down here."
"2884070","2889990"," I want to catch this white line over here as Vwap."
"2899280","2901840"," If you break above this white line, I'll jump back in. "
"2901980","2903860"," But I don't want to, I'm not messing around with this stuff."
"2905760","2908220"," We'll see if we can get a, see if we can sell some shit."
"2916520","2918400"," I want to buy this Vwap to be honest with you. "
"2922460","2925580"," I've been sitting here for at least half an hour in some calls."
"2929400","2931400"," Now 238, 20 minutes left."
"2941420","2942540"," Oh, I'm sorry. "
"2943520","2944000"," I missed the chat."
"2944200","2945100"," Let me look at the chat real quick."
"2946180","2946620"," Okay. "
"2948180","2951920"," Yeah, I went over this often."
"2951920","2955380"," I've traded every, I've traded a ES mini."
"2955620","2958320"," I've never traded the ES, I've never traded the ES, I've never traded the ES mini SPX by. "
"2958680","2961740"," I invest in buy stocks when it's appropriate."
"2963140","2964980"," I used to be a swing trader when it was appropriate."
"2966000","2967060"," It's all contextual. "
"2968100","2971560"," So my live streams are focused upon the live streams specifically."
"2972520","2973840"," I trade spreads."
"2974660","2975120"," I trade anything. "
"2976360","2983340"," These live streams specifically are geared towards day trading, day in, day out, the spy."
"2984600","2985520"," The actual spy."
"2986100","2991400"," This is where right now in time, I make a lot of money. "
"2992980","2996760"," More money than ES, believe it or not, way more money than ES."
"2998080","3000660"," People like trading SPX, I get it for the tax implications."
"3001980","3003800"," They like the consistency of it. "
"3005360","3008040"," It's, it's, it's, it's a very fast to trade spy."
"3008940","3013420"," Day trading spy with zero dates, one dates, three dates, all very, very difficult."
"3018620","3020040"," Oh, man, I want this. "
"3020160","3021120"," I want this so bad."
"3027320","3028480"," So yeah, I trade the spy."
"3028660","3031680"," I trade, I trade Tesla by stock that I go, I trade IWM. "
"3031960","3035460"," I trade choose just right now."
"3035780","3038520"," This is what I've been trading on live stream."
"3040400","3041420"," Hey, Jeff, how you doing?"
"3047910","3052510"," And you guys, some of you guys know me, some of you guys have known me for years, know that"
"3052510","3053790"," I own stock over time. "
"3054830","3055870"," I trade spreads."
"3056150","3059090"," I trade weeklies, monthlies, three month trades."
"3060430","3064310"," But you guys, most of your exposure to me is trading day trading the spy. "
"3070490","3071930"," I need to make videos."
"3071970","3072890"," I still haven't."
"3073010","3073710"," There's a lot of stuff. "
"3073870","3074990"," We talk about this sometimes."
"3075410","3077990"," Anybody that's new, it's new, it's following right now."
"3078410","3085090"," If you haven't followed me or watched the show before, go down to the, go down to the cog and"
"3085090","3088870"," hit the faster button to speed up the, the live stream. "
"3089250","3090590"," And you'll be real time with me."
"3091070","3092590"," YouTube slows the stream."
"3092850","3095510"," Every stream every live stream down by about 15 seconds. "
"3096250","3097590"," So you can trade along with me."
"3108130","3109630"," No, I don't have to."
"3110010","3113070"," So I don't bother with Twitter too much. "
"3113390","3116790"," You guys notice that I don't ever, I never make comments on Twitter."
"3116790","3120390"," If you don't want to be a bitch of people, I don't really care what people are doing or, I'm"
"3120390","3128790"," going to find fuck with people that, like, say I stock or whatever, say I don't really care because"
"3128790","3131490"," their live stream, my trades live every day."
"3132070","3132970"," They're all hindsight traders. "
"3133110","3133990"," Well, they aren't trading at all."
"3134410","3134730"," They're nobody."
"3138650","3142030"," They literally are nobody in subsellers don't have the time to be trading. "
"3142750","3144950"," So we'll just pontificate above."
"3150240","3151880"," Hopefully we can get that VWAP buy."
"3156230","3159270"," Yeah, so we talk about this. "
"3159470","3162250"," This is like, any long time listeners don't want to hear these stories."
"3162930","3163550"," They're here all the time."
"3163730","3165530"," So I'm not, I'm not going to entertain them right now. "
"3167910","3172610"," But if you are following along, you'll have a rant to rave at certain points in these, in these"
"3172610","3173150"," live streams."
"3179960","3181740"," I am a pair of fucking bull Tom."
"3185260","3187500"," Always, always more rants go off. "
"3187640","3188640"," You guys want me to go off?"
"3190680","3192080"," I'll go off in a fucking rant."
"3195160","3196800"," Put your, put your headphones on."
"3199020","3200780"," Hide your husbands and your sons. "
"3204530","3205410"," Put them all away."
"3206830","3208110"," Let's talk about a few things."
"3208310","3208450"," Okay. "
"3209430","3210670"," We'll talk about a few things."
"3211050","3212390"," You guys, you guys want to talk about some shit?"
"3212990","3214570"," I like that double right there."
"3214570","3217310"," I like that little, I like that right there, that reversal. "
"3219310","3219710"," Okay."
"3219810","3220550"," So we're into the end of the day."
"3220850","3221570"," There's a couple of things. "
"3223530","3226550"," I want you to know that anybody that's selling subs out there, right?"
"3227110","3231250"," They have to, they have to have an out."
"3231850","3233210"," So you'll never get an out from me."
"3233250","3234690"," Always tell you where I'm at, what I'm doing. "
"3235570","3236630"," And, uh, Brent crude."
"3237010","3243190"," I'm going to have to send her $14.81 a barrel down $1.45. So one spot to five cents."
"3243610","3247430"," You'll always get me taken where we're going tomorrow, before the end of the close that day. "
"3248190","3251610"," Um, you're going to get mistakes, not mistakes, but just going to get wrong calls there."
"3252050","3255450"," Uh, anyone that's following for a long time knows that I'm most of my calls anywhere."
"3255890","3260370"," Who says EU countries and EU lawmakers agree on rules to curb acquisitions and bids for public"
"3260370","3262610"," contracts by subsidized foreign companies. "
"3264430","3265870"," Have a high rate of success."
"3266450","3268770"," Uh, sometimes up as high as 90%."
"3269370","3270770"," Sometimes as low as 50%. "
"3271310","3272310"," Uh, but never low."
"3272490","3275930"," My average is about 70 to 90% of the time making right calls."
"3276550","3280130"," Um, and I, I trade this stuff live on YouTube. "
"3280750","3282490"," So I want you guys to understand that."
"3282750","3284330"," I want you guys to understand out there."
"3284530","3285990"," I'm going to have to look at this down here. "
"3287110","3289530"," So you've broken this support down below down here, right?"
"3289970","3291130"," So we're now at the next level."
"3292890","3294430"," I want to see if that holds."
"3295370","3297630"," Um, so I want you guys to understand that. "
"3297630","3301550"," Uh, your subsellers don't have the time to do this stuff."
"3301810","3305130"," You're, you got people that pontificate and Twitter get people on Twitter."
"3305250","3307130"," They're just trying to get a job somewhere, believe it or not. "
"3307230","3310990"," You got people on Twitter that are in college or university."
"3311250","3313370"," You might not even know that about the age of some of these people."
"3313710","3317670"," Sometimes people, uh, just fucking around sitting at a desk all day long. "
"3318170","3319110"," They are making fees."
"3319950","3325450"," Uh, you and I as a retail trader out there trying to make a living or retirement or a nest"
"3325450","3327410"," egg or a better life."
"3327410","3328290"," Whatever it is. "
"3328770","3335330"," Uh, you have to be a very conscience, uh, not be gullible to who those people are in this world."
"3335330","3337830"," And especially, uh, when it comes to making money."
"3338150","3339410"," A very important thing, right?"
"3339950","3340810"," Uh, making money. "
"3341630","3345970"," And so when you see someone on Twitter that's commenting saying that guy sucks or that woman sucks."
"3346470","3347570"," Whatever it is, right?"
"3348330","3351530"," Uh, those people are never ever, uh, live trading on YouTube."
"3351810","3353770"," They're not fucking live trading on Twitter. "
"3353770","3359490"," They don't, uh, they don't tell you about, uh, limit stops on options."
"3360350","3364810"," Uh, they don't tell you that, uh, you can exit a trade as it's going up whenever the fuck you"
"3364810","3365830"," want if it goes the wrong way."
"3366190","3367030"," Don't tell you that stuff. "
"3367770","3374730"," Uh, and it's hard, uh, to make those comments on, on Twitter unless they're not really a part of"
"3374730","3374830"," it."
"3375090","3378970"," It's more of just rage, spite, anger, uh, or whatever."
"3379390","3380170"," And so that's fine. "
"3380330","3382070"," When there's people do that stuff, you just ignore them."
"3382450","3388130"," Uh, now for me personally, I, there is no, uh, golfing comment on posts that I make or whatever."
"3388430","3389490"," I go back and fight with people. "
"3389490","3390790"," It's because I don't have the time to do that."
"3391190","3391990"," Um, I got a house."
"3392050","3392390"," I got a wife. "
"3392470","3394890"," I got kids trade day trade in every single day."
"3395370","3396690"," Um, to make money, right?"
"3397430","3399550"," Um, I'm watching the market every single day."
"3399710","3401090"," All those kind of things I'm trying to do. "
"3401130","3403090"," And then I'm trying to like push on information out."
"3403590","3409990"," So it's hard to, uh, have something that's like timely, but then at the same time you're like,"
"3409990","3412710"," well, I sold the profit here or I did that here yesterday."
"3412710","3414110"," I went through so many tweets yesterday. "
"3414530","3417850"," They're all gold, but it fucking this whole week, it's been gold."
"3418630","3421290"," Uh, but at the same time, uh, I can't hold your hand."
"3421290","3422970"," I can't like fly where you live. "
"3423470","3425930"," Press the buy button and sell a button, all that kind of stuff."
"3427110","3430650"," Uh, and I should be here live streaming more often because it is helpful."
"3431230","3434650"," When I had people that helped me trade to learn how to trade, it was very helpful to me. "
"3434770","3435810"," Look at that nice tag of 377."
"3436910","3437650"," I'm gonna buy that."
"3438050","3438510"," Hold on. "
"3438830","3442970"," Hold on."
"3448570","3451250"," I'm gonna go to the 30th here instead of the first."
"3451950","3454710"," Okay, so 380 C's on today, June 30th. "
"3455410","3457290"," They're 48 cents, 49 cents."
"3458430","3459390"," Give me a second here."
"3460790","3461430"," Fucking hate. "
"3461730","3461930"," Fucking."
"3463490","3466390"," Every time I have to fucking buy some shit on, uh, tasty."
"3466670","3469710"," It's fucking like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. "
"3470470","3471370"," I'm missing the trade."
"3474310","3477230"," Okay, so, uh, 50 contracts on 380 C."
"3477230","3478970"," Uh, they're 50 cents."
"3481430","3483390"," Uh, we'll see where that work goes right there. "
"3483610","3484870"," I'm still over here ranting and raving."
"3485010","3486930"," I'm not watching my own fucking levels down here."
"3488530","3491410"," Uh, tag above of the clothes that I'm looking for. "
"3491570","3493990"," Believe it or not is, uh, 381."
"3494430","3496090"," Looks like sellers have come down."
"3496990","3498450"," Now, this is a cell program. "
"3499670","3501990"," Believe it or not, but I'm in some calls right here."
"3502790","3506610"," Uh, so this 3D1 that was above here earlier is now lower."
"3507130","3514130"," They're trying to tell us, they're trying to tell us that, uh, they're trying to tell us that"
"3514130","3515690"," there's pressure down here, right?"
"3516390","3518690"," That they don't want us to move above this level here. "
"3519490","3522750"," Uh, and so we're going to start to either squeeze higher or squeeze lower."
"3523430","3525770"," We're going to take a look real quick at the VIX."
"3525910","3527810"," We're going to take a look around the market and see what's going on. "
"3529170","3530610"," But I want to buy this right here."
"3530690","3531850"," I like this bump right here."
"3531850","3534090"," I'm willing to stay in this trade for a little bit. "
"3534870","3537030"," Uh, we're going to look at the options flow real quick."
"3537250","3541130"," We want to, we want to make sure the one thing we're watching for here, so I want to make"
"3541130","3547250"," sure that no heavy, the one, the one killer here, if you're a bull or buying calls here is if"
"3547250","3550990"," we get, if we get slammed thing kind of hedging, heading in the clothes, it'd be bad."
"3552750","3558750"," I have my eyes over here on, uh, I'm going to delete this real quick, but there's still this giant"
"3558750","3560870"," gap that has been filled on VIX. "
"3560870","3562310"," I'm starting to roll it over."
"3562690","3567290"," I'd really like to see, really want to see this break of this cross from yesterday."
"3568270","3570150"," I'd really like to see something like this. "
"3570170","3570510"," Hold on."
"3570590","3571190"," Let me clear this out."
"3571410","3572230"," It's from a different chart. "
"3572930","3574350"," I'd really like to see this move down."
"3575390","3578010"," And then, then this kind of a thing into the clothes."
"3578770","3581510"," And this is exaggerated right now, but you get my point, right?"
"3582210","3583050"," Uh, for today. "
"3583410","3584390"," That's what I'm looking for."
"3584890","3587370"," That's, that's what I think, not financial advice."
"3587650","3588990"," I can't be able to say that stupid shit. "
"3589750","3590190"," Right?"
"3590470","3592590"," So I'm looking, I'm looking for this move higher."
"3592810","3594170"," This yellow box that I moved down."
"3594450","3596430"," I still believe we move up from here. "
"3596550","3601010"," I believe this is the squeeze fuel to that giant green bar right there."
"3601050","3603270"," Look at that giant monster bar."
"3603590","3606830"," Look at that green fucking bar right there. "
"3606890","3607370"," They bought it."
"3607870","3610550"," So my take is that we trade up in here into this close."
"3611590","3615930"," If we don't, uh, I'm not as, uh, well, there's different options for tomorrow. "
"3616430","3617830"," Not if anyone happens, right?"
"3617990","3618830"," We already talked about that stuff."
"3618830","3620770"," What happens tomorrow, but I bought this right here."
"3621370","3625230"," So we're going to take a look around the market real quick and see what it looks like is going"
"3625230","3625710"," to happen. "
"3626270","3627470"," XLK, right?"
"3628270","3629370"," What's XLK doing?"
"3630330","3630470"," Right?"
"3630950","3632230"," We got a gap above still."
"3632770","3633030"," Right?"
"3633110","3634210"," Is that gray area above?"
"3635390","3637510"," Got a nice beautiful little bull flag for me."
"3637630","3639490"," I don't know what, I don't know what the fuck you're looking for. "
"3639970","3641050"," We did this trade earlier."
"3641990","3642470"," Get rid of that."
"3643130","3647730"," I don't know what you're looking for for for a trade higher into the clothes, but this looks juicy. "
"3648830","3650210"," It looks juicy to me."
"3651290","3652690"," I don't know what you're looking for."
"3653290","3654930"," I don't know if you think this looks bearish. "
"3655450","3656370"," Look at XLF."
"3656710","3658230"," Same kind of a fucking story, right?"
"3659150","3662550"," We'll delete this one from earlier and we'll start setting this next one up."
"3664390","3668830"," So I'm looking at this over here and I'm saying, yeah, it's a big driver of the S&P 500. "
"3669650","3670890"," What is this one doing, right?"
"3671090","3672730"," This one's kind of showing me it wants to go up."
"3673350","3674930"," Could get a little bit weak down to this VWAP."
"3675210","3676070"," We could even dip below. "
"3676070","3679890"," It could be like a little reversal, but then that move higher."
"3680230","3682270"," It's looking bullish to me."
"3682690","3684310"," I don't know what else to have to go on. "
"3684890","3687510"," I'm not fucking Jamie Diamond's fucking dick sucker."
"3689410","3690430"," I don't know."
"3691710","3692730"," It's two-fifths. "
"3692730","3693530"," You've got ten minutes left."
"3693810","3696050"," You could see some weakness at three o'clock and then a push higher."
"3696970","3698110"," We're going to look at XLE, right?"
"3698770","3700410"," XLE's forming a fucking bull flag. "
"3700930","3703990"," This is another reason to get bullish, believe it or not."
"3703990","3706110"," You see this at the same time, right?"
"3706830","3710170"," Even if there's a little bit of weakness down below, that's looking bullish in the close."
"3710830","3715790"," So I think if you're going to take risk on this market, do you want to see XLE trade?"
"3716150","3718730"," Do you want to see fucking into the close XLE doing this?"
"3719570","3722410"," Fuck no, because that's a little leading to that right there, right?"
"3723130","3724410"," That's a bear flag, right?"
"3724650","3727490"," So just classic trading principles. "
"3728250","3729150"," What does it look like?"
"3729330","3730250"," It looks fucking bullish."
"3731530","3732650"," XLE, not so much."
"3732850","3734190"," They already took their profit and they're going to run. "
"3734310","3736530"," But that's kind of a bull flag forming over there, too, isn't it?"
"3736990","3740890"," I know a little fucking ultra fucking bull flag over here on XLE."
"3741130","3744350"," I wish I love XLE right now, by the way."
"3745510","3750730"," So, you know, for bullish of bullish, XLE's looking fucking kind of bullish heading into the close. "
"3751550","3753250"," XLE's looking kind of bullish in the close."
"3754270","3755770"," XLE's looking kind of bullish in the close."
"3755770","3755830"," XLE's looking kind of bullish in the close. "
"3756670","3759310"," Surprise, surprise, XLB, right?"
"3759310","3762330"," Look at XLB over time over five days."
"3762890","3764550"," Looking kind of fucking bullish, right?"
"3765610","3768030"," Got this beautiful flag going down here."
"3768350","3770630"," Bang, consolidate, rip higher to the close. "
"3771390","3772910"," I don't know what happens in a 4PM."
"3773410","3774130"," I have no fucking idea."
"3774370","3774930"," You don't either. "
"3775510","3779050"," But I'll sure as shit tell you what, it's looking mighty fucking bullish overall."
"3779990","3781010"," It really is."
"3781830","3783390"," So we're going to see what happens here. "
"3783930","3787630"," Coming into the VWAP test one time, 37706."
"3787830","3788890"," We're going to see what happens here."
"3788890","3795410"," See if we break VWAP or if we go higher, take a look here and see what happens. "
"3797910","3803330"," 37767 or 87, right in that bottom of that green box that we've been tracking all day long."
"3803950","3805350"," All afternoon we've been tracking this."
"3805490","3806110"," We'll see what happens. "
"3808860","3810580"," See if we get the roll or if we sell."
"3824850","3826510"," I'm watching all of this right now."
"3826870","3828370"," Same thing going out with XLU. "
"3831000","3831680"," Same trade."
"3831920","3833400"," We're looking at XLU earlier today."
"3835200","3838720"," XLU had that bullish move higher, retesting this low right now. "
"3840100","3845740"," So we're going to see if we stick around, if we blast higher from here or if we capitulate and"
"3845740","3847560"," start to trade lower into the close."
"3847820","3850360"," This is kind of the area where you want to have a stop loss."
"3850660","3853620"," If you follow my cursor right here and left hand side. "
"3854100","3856820"," If you're a bull and want to buy somewhere, it's somewhere in here."
"3857340","3858360"," I bought this right here."
"3858980","3862200"," We're going to see if this sticks around and holds or if it begins to sell off. "
"3862780","3867160"," If it begins to sell off into the close, then I will cut my losses."
"3867380","3869040"," But for right now, this is the buy zone."
"3869780","3871360"," And we'll see if we can trade this in the close. "
"3881000","3890650"," Yeah, let me know in the comments."
"3890950","3895470"," Let me know if you're in the comments and your bullish or bearish here."
"3896170","3899770"," Just post the sell the close or buy the close. "
"3900690","3901990"," Sell close, buy close."
"3902210","3902570"," Keep it short."
"3902870","3903830"," Sell close, buy close. "
"3904530","3905450"," And I just bought the close."
"3911160","3912880"," Two fifty four, six minutes left."
"3914160","3918860"," Always a gamble here with the one hour, the power hour, the sour hour for some. "
"3922600","3923200"," Oh, a bag."
"3923340","3924000"," Hold her body."
"3924160","3925060"," Good to see you in the house, bro. "
"3925920","3926280"," Everton."
"3926340","3927120"," Good to see you in the house."
"3927360","3928160"," I haven't seen a bunch of you guys. "
"3929420","3929780"," John."
"3929940","3930420"," Good to see you."

"3962620","3966280"," My take on this is, I don't know how to explain this to you guys. "
"3967800","3970280"," Do you guys know what a limit sell is?"
"3971440","3972340"," You just put a limit."
"3972580","3975900"," If you buy something for a dollar, you say I'm going to sell it at 80 cents."
"3976840","3981240"," If it goes up to $1.20 and you bought it at $1, you raise your limit sell to $1 "
"3981240","3987360",".10. If it goes to $1.30, you raise it to $1.20. You guys all know how to do"
"3987360","3987700"," that, right?"
"3987700","3989280"," So we get stopped out of something. "
"3989660","3991000"," Sometimes it's a fishing expedition."

"4096300","4099560"," You'll never ever get any emails from me requesting money from you. "
"4099760","4103819"," You'll never, ever, ever get me like begging for money from you behind the scenes."
"4104560","4106620"," You'll never, if you're a woman out there, you'll never get."
"4106800","4109520"," If you're a man out there that thinks I'm going to come and try to get nudes that won't. "
"4109760","4115300"," If you're a woman that thinks that you're afraid of men that'll do nasty shit that people do in"
"4115300","4119279"," social media and don't do any of that shit, you'll never see me do any of that stuff."
"4120600","4124060"," The only thing I'll do is I have a few guys out there that'll drunk down at 3 AM."
"4126020","4131960"," I'm not going to name names, but that's more just shit talking at 3 AM. "
"4135830","4137729"," So we'll see if we can break through this or not."
"4137830","4140890"," If we don't break through this area, this is kind of the do or die for the bulls."
"4141370","4144569"," This whole green box, we're tracking this green box all day on this buy box. "
"4145010","4146529"," It's kind of the place right if you're a bull."
"4147130","4148870"," You got this kind of like do or die here."
"4148870","4153550"," If you don't do this do or die here, if you guys want to look and see what the next"
"4153550","4156189"," stop would be, because it's ugly. "
"4157590","4158910"," It's definitely ugly."
"4159830","4163510"," You're probably looking at if we sell off that green box, you're probably going to be looking at"
"4163510","4168149"," 374, 62, 372, 87."
"4169350","4172310"," Pretty steep sell off right now if we sell this box. "
"4172990","4179350"," So you're looking for some really, really low lows, really, really solid by the seashore."
"4179590","4181250"," Really, really, really low lows."
"4182689","4184430"," So I'm going to hold this trade. "
"4185109","4191270"," If we do break this box right here, you guys want to know how to see that, how that happens."
"4191370","4192410"," I'll show it to you right here."
"4194010","4198890"," If you want to get bearish here, you're going to look at that shit. "
"4199710","4204370"," If you want to get bearish here to the close, you do want to see a break, right?"
"4204590","4207050"," Some kind of confirmation on the move down."
"4207530","4210010"," I moved this line earlier, but this is one."
"4210570","4212390"," I move this up because I don't want to make more lines. "
"4212630","4214350"," So then you got another one down to his previous low."
"4215710","4219650"," You do want to see that rejection until you see that rejection on a larger scale."
"4219870","4225290"," So this is just building on an earlier headline that we put out about FTX closing in on a deal"
"4225290","4228070"," to buy Block 5 for 25 million. "
"4229170","4231930"," Block 5C has just made a comment here."
"4231990","4235170"," It's just I can confirm that we aren't being sold for 25 million."
"4235430","4235870"," Jesus. "
"4239310","4240490"," I can't confirm."
"4242450","4245590"," One other thing to take note of today being out of quarter is they could."
"4246190","4249050"," There's also that chance that they'll pin it into the close. "
"4250250","4251090"," It's possible."
"4251470","4253010"," We'll try to pin this right in the close."
"4253010","4259990"," But remember, as we said earlier, we've got all these puts that are coming off into the bell today. "
"4260110","4260250"," Okay."
"4260730","4263830"," You get all these puts right here that are going."
"4264170","4264430"," Bye bye. "
"4265130","4267490"," And we should get a little rip from that."
"4267570","4269950"," Hopefully we get a little rip from that into the bell theoretically."
"4270930","4274870"," But I have to preface that with theoretically, we should get a fat rip into the bell. "
"4276810","4278430"," All those puts go down."
"4278430","4280490"," Again, just building on the earlier EU headlines."
"4280770","4284150"," EU backs rules to put breaks on foreign state funded takeovers. "
"4284390","4287310"," European Parliament lawmakers saying the deal on law was agreed."
"4288490","4290250"," Jeff, I loved your nudes, bro."
"4292570","4293750"," I love your nudes. "
"4294550","4298190"," I just didn't want everybody else to know."
"4311220","4313120"," Vic's still catching a bit right now too."
"4314320","4315880"," Vic's still climbing, climbing. "
"4315880","4318960"," I want to see a rejection on the VIX up here."
"4319460","4321760"," I want to see a rejection at 29, 29, 34."
"4322080","4322640"," We'll see what happens. "
"4331410","4334170"," Profit slowly is making a good comment saying death cross loading on ES."
"4334530","4336070"," One hour check pass reactions to this."
"4336430","4338310"," Six nine was last time this happened. "
"4340220","4343260"," Do you think volume will be low tomorrow given it's a holiday weekend?"
"4343800","4345260"," Usually on holiday weekends."
"4345700","4347660"," Usually, of course, wiki can attest to this."
"4348080","4349180"," I'll fucking tell you what. "
"4349260","4350280"," If you're listening to me right now, right?"
"4350280","4351840"," Most fucking holidays."
"4352440","4355140"," The retail runs the fucking house."
"4356000","4357360"," And they run this shit. "
"4357520","4360500"," So you know, there are more retail bulls than retail bears."
"4361200","4362380"," I don't know if you know this or not."
"4363040","4365840"," And retail usually, it's like a fucking animal house. "
"4366620","4368640"," They fucking just run shit up."
"4368920","4369820"," They just run it up."
"4370100","4371020"," They run it up. "
"4371200","4372320"," They run it up dirty."
"4373280","4376720"," And this is the first holiday I've seen in a long time."
"4377720","4382260"," Even in a bear market, that retail has not run up the stock market. "
"4383380","4385480"," The parents are still here."
"4386080","4388720"," There's like an old dirty fat white guy with greasy palms."
"4389060","4392800"," Sitting in a 90 degree room in fucking Charleston in a steak house. "
"4393780","4393920"," Right?"
"4394480","4399020"," And he's just finished playing golf down south at Kewa Island or something."
"4399560","4404560"," And he's got like the he's got like the FaceTime going and he's got the grip on this fat old"
"4404560","4404880"," phone."
"4404880","4406480"," It's like red phone. "
"4406640","4411160"," He's like, I gotta get my fucking put spreads for JPM to print."
"4412680","4417000"," So, you know, there's this like wag the dog thing that's going on right now."
"4417660","4423920"," And at the moment that fat old like I puts that phone down, retail should take over and run it"
"4423920","4424120"," up. "
"4424520","4426200"," Now do they run it up tomorrow?"
"4426740","4427740"," I have no fucking idea."
"4429580","4434220"," But supposedly there's a big fat white greasy hand on the phone right now saying no."
"4435220","4440100"," Usually we get to run it up at the end of month and the corner specifically and do the holiday"
"4440550","4441260"," Fourth of July. "
"4442020","4442660"," What do you do?"
"4442880","4444540"," This is like a real weird thing."
"4444680","4446360"," But what do you do?"
"4446540","4446760"," You commit?"
"4446980","4447920"," What are you going to do?"
"4448040","4452300"," You're going to call your fucking broker and say what the fuck?"
"4452620","4453740"," And I'll tell you what?"
"4453740","4458240"," We're getting close to that point where your broker tells you don't worry."
"4458260","4461220"," I shorted the market or that shit doesn't fly. "
"4461940","4465600"," You want to go home to your wife and your kids and your uncle and your friend and your father"
"4465600","4469360"," in law that you hate and be like, oh yeah, I bought this and I bought oil and gas and"
"4469360","4469600"," whatever."
"4470640","4474440"," You know, you want some window dressing on the quarter and we're not getting it."
"4474820","4475940"," They're not giving it to us. "
"4476020","4478380"," You're not getting any window dressing this quarter."
"4480280","4481900"," So, you know, that's what it is."
"4482900","4490100"," Hopefully, hopefully the old man prints this fat money and we get to run this up tomorrow before"
"4490100","4491320"," the end of, for the weekend. "
"4494120","4498680"," Still sitting here just grinding, just grinding right now."
"4499220","4501980"," 304, no definitive move."
"4502740","4505940"," The VIX still moving up, no moves in the stock market. "
"4506700","4509080"," Not watching any kind of flow coming in."
"4510920","4514080"," Any kind of meaningful flow coming in right now."
"4514940","4520540"," You can actually see down the bottom of hand the screen that there's no meaningful flow coming in. "
"4520860","4525460"," If you want to pay attention to something on the bottom left hand side of your screen, you want to"
"4525460","4530160"," paying attention to any kind of nasty hedges coming in, either red or green."
"4530900","4532920"," If you see green hedging coming in, it should be good."
"4533220","4538700"," If you see any kind of like just nasty red million dollar hedges come in, be wary of that. "
"4538780","4540260"," It should make the market weak briefly."
"4540700","4541880"," You'll see a market reversal."
"4543360","4546680"," You're watching the VIX catch a bit, but yet it's in Contango. "
"4547460","4551640"," Contango, so you're not getting that reversal that you're looking for as a bear currently."
"4552280","4554120"," We're still in this cross right now."
"4554600","4556020"," Just pay attention to this cross. "
"4556080","4557960"," You can see this cross here as it's developing."
"4559220","4562760"," I don't know if we can do this like this, but I don't know if we can show you this."
"4562760","4567640"," If you follow my cursor, you want to see this cross get above here. "
"4567820","4569140"," You don't want to see this cross."
"4569620","4572460"," You don't want to see this cross right here."
"4573340","4574140"," Stay below. "
"4574340","4577780"," If it does, you will see a drop in the spot right now."
"4579880","4581220"," You will see that drop."
"4591840","4601670"," I'm going to"
"4601670","4603750"," take one more here. "
"4604590","4607150"," Watch a little bit of a break in the market."
"4607470","4608470"," Let's see this here."
"4617380","4620040"," A little break, some weakness in the market. "
"4620220","4622820"," You are watching no bid in the market right now."
"4627500","4629840"," You can see support breaking down in the market."
"4631280","4633000"," 37563 to 374. "
"4633840","4635260"," We'll bring this up right here."
"4636320","4638480"," You are seeing a break in the market currently."
"4638780","4641400"," You probably end up seeing a look for a tag below. "
"4641960","4642760"," It's at 374."
"4643900","4648000"," You can also see 37550 right in here."
"4648860","4650800"," You should see this break as well. "
"4651160","4652780"," You should see this break through here."
"4654120","4654640"," 37550."
"4655420","4657540"," A price target down below of 374. "
"4659820","4660860"," Now 37350."
"4661680","4664500"," You can also end up seeing if you guys are watching."
"4664680","4666520"," This is the 372 I was talking about earlier. "
"4667900","4669160"," We'll take a look right here."
"4669160","4669860"," Some support."
"4670100","4670960"," Some suppliers. "
"4671220","4672120"," Demand coming in 374."
"4673000","4676080"," 34, which is still way down here."
"4678420","4680860"," We're going to look for some weakness in the market now. "
"4681420","4684380"," We're going to take this demand."
"4685820","4687740"," We're going to put it right down here."
"4689420","4692280"," You look for a move lower down to 37450. "
"4692280","4697940"," A little break taking place right now."
"4704610","4708890"," Vic's starting to roll over and start to consolidate."
"4715720","4717200"," Demand much lower right now. "
"4717480","4719740"," More buyers than sellers right now."
"4719920","4722560"," A lot of pressure building on the sell side."
"4722700","4724300"," You can see it if you look closely here. "
"4726700","4729960"," On the right hand side, you can see the sellers trying to sell this market down."
"4730720","4732720"," You can see here 37452."
"4733220","4735100"," It lets you correspond right about here. "
"4737140","4741880"," We'll look for lower lows here and see if we can find some support."
"4744920","4747760"," We can raise this up a little bit here so you can see it better."
"4751100","4752760"," We don't want to see a rejection here. "
"4752860","4756380"," If you see this rejection here on the right hand side, you want to see this stay."
"4757600","4759220"," We'll get that stat out of this here for a second."
"4766810","4768110"," Move that up a little bit. "
"4774390","4775590"," Right there."
"4782430","4787690"," So, according to an exclusive here, chances of reviving the Iran nuclear deal are worse after the"
"4787690","4789730"," Doha talks than they were before."
"4790490","4794650"," Iran made vague demands and asked for things unrelated to the nuclear deal and reopened settled"
"4794650","4796870"," issues according to a US official. "
"4796870","4802130"," It says they could describe the Doha talks as trading wars at best and moving backwards at worst."
"4802670","4807090"," Prospects to revive the Iran 2015 nuclear deal were getting worse by the day."
"4807510","4812710"," A negotiation that needs to happen is within Iran over whether it wants to revive the nuclear deal. "
"4813170","4815550"," So, again, this is according to a senior US official there."

"4839690","4841030"," We're right back to support 375."
"4844830","4850910"," I want you to see on the right hand side of the screen, you've got 374.89, 374.04, and"
"4850910","4852050"," then the low 372. "
"4853390","4854170"," We talked about this earlier."
"4854570","4862650"," You would see 372.83. Into this close, let's go back and look at spy into this close."
"4869250","4870830"," Let's take a look at this close here. "
"4872090","4877010"," So, this close yesterday, we traded into the close, traded down, and found support."
"4877850","4880010"," You can see this support we found down below."
"4880350","4886310"," This is the green box that's over on your, on your, we moved this green box down for buyers down"
"4886310","4886550"," below. "
"4886750","4892590"," This is the previous low here at 372.56. We're going to look back real quick, and we're going to"
"4892590","4894090"," look at this previous low."
"4894430","4898410"," The next previous low, we're going to move this down now to this next one."
"4898510","4904690"," This is, we're going to go back now to 376.75, and we're going to see where that is. "
"4905750","4906550"," Hold on here."
"4906910","4907450"," Five day."
"4913740","4918120"," 365.67, and you can see that we're being led down into tomorrow. "
"4918120","4919920"," This is the next previous low."
"4919920","4922880"," Way, way, way, way back over there, right down in here."
"4923060","4923940"," This is the buy box. "
"4924340","4931340"," If we trade down into here, you have to realize this, that we could still come down into here, into"
"4931340","4935320"," the close, and then into Friday, we get another push up into the close."
"4935840","4937980"," Just be conscious of this as we trade down."
"4939140","4941200"," We're still getting some weakness and some rejection. "
"4942140","4945840"," I don't know if I'd buy this down here, this supply that's saying that it's here."
"4945840","4950680"," If we break this down, I might want to, or I'm not might want to, I would end up waiting"
"4950680","4959040"," for either the close down in here, or even the open tomorrow to grab this down below and tag this"
"4959040","4959840"," previous low."
"4960360","4965880"," If you are a bull right now, this is bearish, even though everything is saying that we're in a"
"4965880","4967220"," bullish context right now. "
"4968080","4969920"," We are switching to the bear side."
"4972780","4974880"," Never like seeing that in the close ever."
"4978110","4979890"," Also free floating right now. "
"4980210","4983570"," Not seeing too much markets losing its complete bid."
"4983830","4985310"," You can see it right here."
"4986070","4987970"," There's no bid in the market right now. "
"4988030","4993770"," You get buyers stepping in currently, but even with those buyers stepping in, there's not much into"
"4993770","4994790"," the market right now."
"4994830","4995690"," It's just kind of quiet."
"4996890","4998730"," We're going to see what happens into this close. "
"5000590","5003190"," This is that downward trend just below."
"5004450","5006070"," I'm kind of sweating right now."
"5006350","5009330"," I always hate these closes that are like, yeah, down here. "
"5011430","5013050"," So we'll see what happens into the spell."
"5014790","5016310"," I'm sweating bullets here."
"5018150","5018990"," End of quarter. "
"5020090","5020490"," No fireworks."
"5021010","5022850"," No fourth of July for you if you're a bull."
"5023370","5025750"," No fourth of July for you if you always look good on things. "
"5029740","5034020"," Yeah, I triggered my zero date calls triggered long time ago."
"5035080","5036200"," Long time ago."
"5040150","5041390"," I'm in nothing right now. "
"5045540","5047420"," He's got to be wearing a golden tuxedo."
"5047600","5047680"," Right?"
"5048920","5049320"," Yeah."
"5049520","5050260"," My joke. "
"5051140","5052180"," Why is there any call or not?"
"5052320","5052420"," Sorry."
"5052440","5053040"," I didn't have zero."
"5053280","5053480"," One day. "
"5053720","5055920"," Oh, no, wait a minute."
"5056420","5056920"," Take a look."
"5057780","5058180"," Yeah. "
"5058340","5059120"," I had a fifth."
"5059300","5060000"," I had 53."
"5061020","5062480"," C's and they are gone. "
"5063740","5064540"," Let me look at my."
"5068730","5070550"," And they were on June 30th."
"5070550","5072430"," I have to look at my activity. "
"5072770","5072990"," Hold on."
"5074430","5078630"," I had June 30th, 50 June 30th, 380 C's."
"5078910","5080530"," They triggered at 22 cents. "
"5083790","5086550"," I bought them at 32 cents lost a third on that trade."
"5097230","5099010"," I had that trade up in here."
"5099650","5100490"," Right up in here. "
"5100550","5101810"," It's as we broke through right here."
"5101930","5103070"," They're selling."
"5104490","5107650"," So this is not bullish if you want to know this. "
"5107650","5110110"," Even this zone down here is now gone."
"5110390","5113270"," You can see that the buyers have disappeared."
"5113390","5115810"," You got a little bit over here, but still not. "
"5115990","5116470"," You know what it is?"
"5116670","5118730"," It's like it's like it's like a black death."
"5119390","5120670"," Let's look back in time."
"5121210","5121830"," Way to see this. "
"5122570","5124270"," You can see this down here."
"5124870","5127110"," Way to see this on a larger time frame."
"5127470","5129430"," There's really nothing down here. "
"5129690","5132150"," Right down to three seventy two ninety one."
"5132590","5135890"," And you can see this three seventy two ninety one."
"5135890","5137430"," It's like right here. "
"5137830","5140210"," So we could go up here, but at the same time."
"5141570","5143510"," At the same time, the real buyers."
"5144790","5149450"," Are way down here like real money buyers three seventy two ninety one. "
"5149450","5150330"," They're right here."
"5151390","5153190"," So they're way down here."
"5153270","5157350"," If you look closely here on the right hand side of the screen, you can see three seventy four"
"5157350","5159090"," eighty nine three seventy four eighty nine. "
"5159550","5160790"," Starting to step in."
"5163590","5164410"," Seventy four."
"5166050","5166810"," Yeah, somewhat. "
"5167070","5167790"," They're down here."
"5167970","5168210"," For sure."
"5168370","5169330"," I know they're down here. "
"5169470","5170010"," They're not up here."
"5170710","5172250"," You saw this one break here."
"5172350","5173370"," This was an important break. "
"5173870","5175410"," This break right here is very important."
"5175690","5179770"," This next one is a call sellers, of course, not trying to get out of their calls."
"5180210","5183970"," And more than likely down here three seventy three seventy two ninety four. "
"5184230","5184890"," Something like this."
"5185410","5188270"," But even buying this, I'm not sure that I'd be willing to."
"5188990","5191270"," Maybe I'd buy this at four fifteen. "
"5191890","5195230"," But even then it's easier to buy the by the open tomorrow."
"5196090","5197250"," So I might just buy."
"5197450","5201690"," The US promises bigger fines and stepped up enforcement of sensitive technology. "
"5201750","5204210"," Look at the bear watching right now."
"5204310","5205170"," This is your bear trade."
"5208460","5210000"," Let's have a look even closer. "
"5211220","5213700"," Right down here three seventy four thirty one."
"5214140","5215660"," First tags to be right here."
"5216600","5218980"," Let's snap this line down here for you three seventy four. "
"5219640","5220280"," Hold on."
"5222440","5223480"," Three seventy four."
"5225140","5225900"," Right here. "
"5227600","5230440"," And you can see this firm break move this way."
"5231620","5233940"," You can see this nice firm break down below."
"5239340","5243500"," And you can start to see where these levels are three seventy four fifty three seventy two fifty. "
"5243880","5245200"," That's called real money too."
"5245340","5246160"," If you don't know this."
"5246580","5248140"," This is going to be real money buyers. "
"5248140","5252100"," It does say as Russia and China have worked their way up the list of US national security concerns."
"5252100","5255800"," Successive administrations have placed greater weight on regulations."
"5255920","5259560"," Designed to keep sensitive US technology out of the hands of the geopolitical rivals. "
"5260280","5263580"," Now the agency in charge of enforcing those rules is trying to give them sharper teeth."
"5263960","5267720"," Including by imposing bigger fines on companies that mishandle restrict the technology."
"5268380","5268940"," They go. "
"5269340","5270740"," It's fucking sucks when you fucking."
"5271220","5273040"," It's I do like end of quarter."
"5275720","5276240"," Angry. "
"5276720","5279240"," I won't even buy puts just out of spite right now."
"5281060","5282100"," Just out of spite."
"5282300","5283940"," I'm like fuck you taking a short here. "
"5284160","5284820"," No way."
"5284900","5287140"," I'm taking a short broke right below this."
"5287320","5287740"," Right. "
"5287920","5288900"," We sold the way."
"5289120","5290860"," Let's go back and review this."
"5291540","5293280"," So we topped out of here. "
"5293440","5294540"," Took this trade right here."
"5295100","5295740"," We entered."
"5296060","5299440"," I think I entered once and made a little bit of money got stopped out made a little bit of"
"5299440","5300400"," money got stopped out. "
"5300720","5302240"," Bought this down below down here."
"5302580","5304680"," And sure enough as soon as you broke below."
"5305500","5307760"," It wasn't doing anything below VWAP down here. "
"5308400","5309560"," Is turning negative."
"5310140","5313020"," If you end up trading higher here to VWAP."
"5313360","5315300"," You know more than likely get get sold. "
"5315680","5319380"," So my assumption is that we're going to trade down into the close."
"5319660","5323260"," It's 3 17 p.m. It's possible we could trade up into the end of the day."
"5323640","5326740"," You still have 40 minutes left to make a trade higher. "
"5327220","5327900"," But no honesty."
"5328200","5329960"," I have no interest in buying this here."
"5330700","5331920"," I don't want to buy 375. "
"5331920","5332940"," I want to buy."
"5333620","5334120"," 3 72."
"5334580","5335060"," 3 74. "
"5336060","5338420"," Somewhere down there for where we are right now."
"5338880","5340940"," And to be anymore more frank."
"5341400","5345280"," If you're looking at if you're looking at just a lot in a larger time frame. "
"5346060","5346240"," Right."
"5346480","5348140"," We're going to look at a larger time frame."
"5349080","5353140"," Where would you rather buy if you're going to if you're watching how this is going here. "
"5353280","5353380"," Right."
"5353540","5357160"," We straight down bounce up trade down sideways and down this."
"5357340","5358320"," I got wrecked on this one. "
"5358420","5360340"," I think we got made tons of money in here."
"5360340","5362200"," Got wrecked down this and made great money in here."
"5363100","5366340"," But look at where would you want to buy this. "
"5367260","5369640"," So we if we break this right here."
"5369800","5369900"," Right."
"5370020","5372780"," If we broke this or the support was right here. "
"5373320","5374800"," I want to say we make this a little better."
"5374920","5376260"," We had a little green box down here."
"5376380","5376500"," Right. "
"5376740","5381940"," If we break this box for this leg higher and we break below here now."
"5381940","5382260"," Right."
"5382860","5383820"," Where do you want to buy it?"
"5383860","5385000"," You want to buy it down here. "
"5385360","5386080"," You want to buy it."
"5386100","5386660"," You want to buy that."
"5386980","5388040"," You don't want to be buying like. "
"5388040","5388900"," Oh yeah."
"5389020","5389500"," I'm going to save."
"5390140","5391280"," I'm going to save. "
"5391540","5393620"," I'm going to save this dip by for a rip higher."
"5394060","5397440"," You can you're almost have a confirmation that you're going to go down here."
"5398040","5401780"," If not even lower to touch this three sixty seven. "
"5402420","5403400"," In tomorrow."
"5403400","5406760"," So if you're a bull you have to reposition yourself."
"5406760","5408140"," Now once you break through. "
"5408580","5410560"," Once you break through the support right here."
"5412580","5413480"," Right here."
"5413620","5413780"," Right. "
"5414560","5415700"," It's all about reposition."
"5415700","5420420"," It's not about trying to save someone's life or anything like that either kind of stuff."
"5420840","5422660"," When you have this by zone that gets broken. "
"5423200","5425000"," You look towards your next by zone."
"5425380","5425860"," Right."
"5426060","5428060"," Your next by zone comes down here. "
"5428300","5428400"," Right."
"5428940","5432680"," So now you wait patiently until you get your by zone into tomorrow."
"5433260","5435740"," If you don't find it into the clothes here. "
"5436220","5439380"," Then you're going to wait for it into tomorrow to take that next trade higher."
"5440800","5441860"," But it does suck."
"5442300","5442960"," End of fucking day. "
"5443280","5444260"," Never like seeing that."
"5444260","5444840"," I'm a bull."
"5445080","5447160"," I don't want to see support here break. "
"5447520","5449900"," And so you're seeing that support break into the clothes."
"5451260","5453500"," You're seeing that in the clothes."
"5454300","5456240"," Makes you want to reposition. "
"5456920","5459080"," Now can this trade higher into."
"5459600","5461880"," Let's say let me get this back here."
"5462140","5462920"," Three eighty one. "
"5463780","5465780"," See these buyers down below here."
"5466060","5466700"," I want you to see this."
"5467040","5469620"," See this VWAP had a reclaimed VWAP right. "
"5470160","5472280"," See where VWAP is right here on the left hand side."
"5472280","5474680"," Do you want to take this trade to reclaim VWAP?"
"5474960","5475480"," I don't."
"5476160","5479860"," I always I prefer always to take this trade down here. "
"5480620","5481020"," Right."
"5481840","5483920"," Then this trade up here."
"5484060","5485460"," I'd rather not take this trade. "
"5485800","5491400"," I'd rather buy it lower in most bulls day traders are going to say, no, I don't need to take"
"5491400","5491820"," this trade."
"5492100","5493600"," I don't care if it trades up here."
"5493640","5495160"," I'm going to wait for it to come back down. "
"5495980","5497280"," And so that's what we're going to do."
"5497680","5498560"," You can buy that."
"5498680","5499280"," I'm not buying that. "
"5500780","5501960"," So I'm going to wait here."
"5502400","5504980"," I'd really I'd really like to see this down here."
"5505080","5508220"," Three seventy two fifty seven would be gangster to buy. "
"5508880","5510380"," Three fifty to drive down here."
"5510640","5512040"," Even three seventy down here."
"5512380","5513520"," It would be a beautiful thing to buy. "
"5516210","5517870"," I always like the end of the day show."
"5518270","5520990"," I always like like the pump the end of the day pump and the quarter pump."
"5531180","5533520"," Jay Pausa, no for the July rally this year. "
"5536290","5536730"," Yeah."
"5536890","5538410"," Actually, let's talk about that."
"5539870","5541890"," That's a good that's a good actually conversation. "
"5544430","5546270"," So let's talk about."
"5548010","5548890"," Into this close."
"5549090","5549910"," Let's talk about something. "
"5551770","5553110"," You ended up getting."
"5553990","5556990"," And watch this Vwap above here."
"5557050","5557730"," We'll get rid of this. "
"5558790","5560650"," And we'll get rid of well we could."
"5561310","5563350"," It's actually a good resistance now."
"5565070","5566890"," This now actually becomes resistance here. "
"5566890","5567550"," And this is gone."
"5569010","5570030"," That means nothing."
"5570470","5571950"," The only thing that means anything right now. "
"5573110","5575830"," You've gone from support to resistance."
"5576910","5580270"," And so you'll be looking for resistance here in the bell."
"5582190","5585530"," You'll be looking for Vwap resistance into the bell. "
"5588360","5591140"," And we've got a top over here of three seventy eight sixty."
"5592140","5595020"," So we're going to lower this down as well."
"5597540","5599580"," Three seventy eight sixty I think. "
"5599580","5599980"," Is that it?"
"5600820","5601680"," It's even lower."
"5605770","5614740"," That's now resistance right here."
"5616860","5618740"," So let's talk about quarters. "
"5621060","5622760"," I want you to do some homework over the weekend."
"5625240","5627920"," I want you to over the weekend."
"5628260","5629140"," If you have some time. "
"5631710","5633490"," I want you to search."
"5635090","5636590"," Nasdaq or CME."
"5637610","5641910"," I want you to look and see when you've had two negative quarters. "
"5643250","5644210"," On average."
"5645470","5647850"," How long does it take for the stock market to recover."
"5650030","5653170"," So if you have two bad quarters, what does your third quarter look like?"
"5653310","5658330"," I want you to look at what it looks like after three, four and five quarters. "
"5658970","5661930"," Because it does begin to predict."
"5663490","5667370"," An average of how long it takes for the stock market to recover."
"5668330","5669110"," So when you. "
"5670630","5674990"," When you look at one bad quarter, not so bad."
"5676150","5680710"," When you like start to calculate one bad quarter, one good quarter to one bad quarter."
"5681150","5681910"," Not so bad. "
"5681990","5683550"," It's kind of like a sideways market."
"5684210","5688930"," When you start to have multiple quarters one after another that are bad."
"5688930","5694190"," The recovery time from that from those two bad quarters is substantial. "
"5695470","5698750"," That could mean that we have a green quarter."
"5699670","5701430"," Green q three overall."
"5701470","5704890"," We looked at the put structure in the market. "
"5707910","5709990"," And we can look at it right here, right?"
"5710250","5711590"," You can see that negative July."
"5712730","5717590"," You can see into July and October or excuse me, August not so bad."
"5718310","5722730"," And that are actually not so bad until we get to nine sixteen down here, right?"
"5723410","5731270"," So you can see weakness watch my much my eraser weakness here up weakness here up right into"
"5731270","5732610"," September. "
"5732610","5738330"," So if you watch my cursor right down up down up right into September and you end up having a"
"5738330","5739150"," green quarter."
"5739950","5743390"," So you have q one bad q two bad q three is good."
"5744330","5746850"," Towards end of quarter towards September. "
"5746990","5749910"," Let's call it late August late September."
"5750670","5752190"," I used to be early September."
"5752810","5758170"," You close q three slightly green and then you end up having a really bad December. "
"5759910","5767090"," So just take that into context or if we bounced off the weekly moving average in the fifty."
"5767090","5774890"," If we end up trading below the fifty moving average, the two hundred weekly moving average."
"5775350","5781410"," Do we actually accelerate the losses if we end up just getting a bloodbath q three rather than q"
"5781410","5782510"," four being down. "
"5783570","5787210"," So calculate a way to look at the your quarter closes historically."
"5787610","5795210"," And then I want you to think about that when we look at a meeting with the two hundred week"
"5795210","5796810"," moving average, right?"
"5796810","5797850"," The weekly moving average."
"5799350","5804190"," If you look at if you put parts those two together, what you're going to wind up being able to"
"5804190","5807190"," look at and say, okay, so we have had two bad quarters. "
"5807270","5809350"," We know the recovery is going to take longer than expected."
"5810030","5815110"," It's probably going to take four to six quarters for recovery in the stock market, which we're"
"5815110","5816470"," going to finalize today."
"5817430","5821450"," So you're going to get four to six quarters of recovery time minimum. "
"5822710","5825770"," From from the beginning from January one."
"5825770","5832770"," So you wind up your recovery time is now December into June of twenty twenty three."
"5833750","5836050"," No matter what how it plays out. "
"5836310","5840810"," Second thing is you're going to look for two other movements."
"5840830","5844730"," You're either going to look when we meet up finally with the weekly moving average."
"5845230","5851550"," If we bounce off of it, you should expect the end of two three to be green, even if it's"
"5851550","5852050"," only slightly. "
"5852890","5857370"," And then even if the banks are telling you we're going to close the year at all time highs, believe"
"5857370","5861170"," it or not, you're probably going to get a bad, bad, bad to four."
"5862020","5870370"," Now, if we trade below the 50 the 200 weekly moving average, you're going to wind up seeing Q three"
"5870370","5871690"," be a fucking bloodbath."
"5872450","5874870"," An absolute utter bloodbath. "
"5875490","5877850"," You'll see the market break at some point."
"5877970","5883610"," You will see the fed put come in and you would actually see a recovery in Q four."
"5884190","5888410"," That would be the fast that would be the fast answer as to what happens. "
"5888410","5896830"," But those two what are two of those key indicators are very important to how that plays out."
"5897230","5904450"," The brutal part of that is that either way you will see with two bad quarters."
"5904610","5910530"," If you look at the historical figures, if you look at the historical figures, you will see that"
"5910530","5916330"," that bloodbath that either takes place in Q three or the nasty. "
"5916330","5924250"," Q four does lead to five six quarters until we get a recovery, which is brutal."
"5924250","5925690"," Like you don't want to see that, right?"
"5925850","5928710"," You don't want to see it take five six quarters."
"5928850","5934650"," That puts us into mid 2023, maybe even late 2023. "
"5934870","5938950"," And I would expect after today that you will see this in the news."
"5939970","5942250"," You'll see this talked about finally in the news."
"5942250","5947170"," The implications of putting two bad quarters together if I haven't checked the news today. "
"5947330","5950250"," So I'm assuming that at some point that will come out."
"5951830","5954030"," So nice, nice bounce here down below."
"5954210","5958870"," We'll see if we get a rejection above at 377 49 378. "
"5960390","5966590"," Into this close still muted close looks like they're going to park it into the close right now."
"5967590","5969570"," Nothing much resistance above."
"5972580","5974100"," Let's see a look here. "
"5974640","5977240"," Still that resistance here at 378 65."
"5978480","5982740"," That puts us right here right inside of this yellow zone right here."
"5983080","5986420"," And then above you've got a 379 88. "
"5987120","5992180"," So we'll raise will lower this 379 88 is right here."
"5995480","6000320"," And we'll see what happens to close 329 in the afternoon 30 minute one minutes left until end of"
"6000320","6000520"," quarter."
"6001000","6004820"," Congratulations to the bears for two to being read. "
"6005420","6009140"," Congratulations to the bears for Q one and Q two total being read."
"6010380","6015240"," Let me know in the chat if you think you see will Q three will end green or we think"
"6015240","6016500"," two three will end."
"6016500","6020820"," Not the start of it or should be not do we like get a blood bath. "
"6021160","6024340"," I want to know do you think Q three ends green from here."
"6024700","6028660"," So we're going to end up closing this quarter at 375 380."
"6029000","6034420"," Do we close above this and Q three or do we close a blow it in Q three. "
"6037080","6038400"," That's a fucking parking lot."
"6048620","6051440"," Yeah, tell me I want to know but I want to know about the quarter."
"6054170","6057990"," This early this morning we talked about the there should be a bloodbath in July. "
"6060610","6061690"," Early July."
"6063230","6068930"," Now er says otherwise we should trade sideways and then down into late July."
"6070270","6077450"," So if you're going to buy puts for for the bloodbath in July, I would date them for August not"
"6077450","6078910"," for like July 15. "
"6079680","6082370"," I'd be like August 15 then cash them out."
"6083350","6088030"," Either mid July or early July or late July depending on whatever it happens."
"6091230","6097670"," And then let me know in the chat if you think that will close Q three like when we're sitting"
"6097670","6097990"," here. "
"6098590","6101590"," On September 30 is it 30 days in September."
"6102420","6109270"," June July August September 30 I think we're sitting here but just like today."
"6109770","6116770"," Will we will we close below 375 at 375 380 or will we close above or below. "
"6117810","6120450"," I'd like to know because I think we close above."
"6121390","6123230"," I think we close Q three."
"6123430","6124950"," I think we bloodbath this down. "
"6124950","6131790"," I have I've I think I think I think my viewpoint is that we bounced off the weekly moving average"
"6131790","6139330"," or trade just below it then reclaim it and then we close actually 380 maybe maybe slightly green."
"6140870","6144050"," That's what I think that if I'm like just just spitballing."
"6145290","6146570"," That's what I think happens. "
"6149640","6152640"," Trade and hire now we'll see if this resistance sticks or not."
"6158390","6160130"," I'm not in any trades right now."
"6160570","6161670"," They ain't day trades right now. "
"6162210","6165070"," I'm still holding calls into July right now."
"6165830","6168870"," I'm in zero day trades and that I'm not trading this at all."
"6169390","6169890"," I have no interest"
"6169890","6180450"," in"
"6180450","6180450"," this. "
"6181210","6184010"," We do a sneaky peat into the clothes that be interested."
"6185050","6186790"," I'm not seeing anything over there either."
"6201840","6203520"," See if we can see anything else in here. "
"6208020","6209320"," Support down here at 375."
"6216300","6217160"," Let me know in the chat."
"6217280","6218800"," I want to know if you think we'll close green. "
"6220000","6221580"," Two three slight green."
"6221660","6224460"," We happy with three to close all depends in the yard."
"6224460","6225380"," I don't have insider acts. "
"6225560","6225860"," I don't know."
"6226080","6228580"," But if I throw a few bucks over you say slight green key three."
"6228980","6233320"," I would say below 375 and a few three key three closing target on spy. "
"6234180","6236260"," Three thirty eight three fifty."
"6237240","6238200"," So all right."
"6238320","6243040"," That's an innocent is saying closing target on spy and two three is three thirty eight three fifty. "
"6243860","6247520"," Staring rate as hopefully don't crack that pre COVID high at three thirty nine."
"6247520","6248680"," Leave that for you for."
"6250400","6252940"," So I want to ask Edison the question. "
"6253440","6259760"," If you close three if you close three two three red right."
"6261600","6262140"," Historically."
"6264800","6265340"," Historic. "
"6265700","6267280"," Yeah, I'm not a bear in this close or ball."
"6267400","6268580"," I'm just I'm not trading it."
"6270000","6272980"," So my question is if you close three red. "
"6276220","6281760"," That would imply to me that there's a bloodbath and so if you get that bloodbath."
"6283260","6288100"," Wow, that's that's a sideways I guess Edison saying a sideways trade then for Q three and then a"
"6288100","6289380"," bloodbath and Q four."
"6290060","6291200"," I haven't thought about that one. "
"6291760","6294780"," I don't know that one at all."
"6295460","6299900"," Low of quarter three forty probably read around three fifty."
"6300460","6303260"," Yeah, mirrors in the house wants to rip it into the clothes right. "
"6305320","6306900"," Blast off into the clothes."
"6309180","6311820"," Sitting and break through the sellers here."
"6313680","6316160"," As a price is four times leverage on Feds balance. "
"6316160","6317460"," You would nice that correlation."
"6317500","6318500"," I look math."
"6319140","6322480"," He will bring and to rate hikes end of bloodbath mid July. "
"6322660","6326720"," We bought him a three or four fifty four K retest by September."
"6326840","6327680"," Yeah, it's all good."
"6328160","6333640"," When I see like the two three bloodbath or two three bread and two four bloodbath. "
"6334040","6335720"," I guess that can be interchangeable."
"6336140","6337820"," I like that idea too."
"6338140","6341680"," I think that the faster that we bloodbath it the faster we start going up again. "
"6342360","6343660"," Maris saying clothes and green."
"6344280","6345600"," You're talking about JPM."
"6345860","6347220"," Yeah, we talked about that this morning Marcus. "
"6347600","6348800"," Talked about the color this morning."
"6349700","6351700"," Went all one all about the color this morning."
"6351800","6353180"," Talked all about it all more and long. "
"6358710","6359110"," Oh."
"6360990","6361990"," Hold on a second here."
"6373500","6375600"," We got another bid that came into the market. "
"6375600","6383880"," Let me just second."
"6384020","6384700"," I might buy one of these."
"6389270","6391210"," I think tomorrow just trades sideways. "
"6391210","6392690"," They were saying Q three red."
"6392770","6394030"," If NATO signs new members."
"6394330","6395090"," That's a good one Richard. "
"6395090","6396070"," I haven't thought about that."
"6396350","6396690"," That's fair."
"6400230","6402750"," I'm saying another 30 points down to end. "
"6403170","6405330"," That's a key point to here is end Q three."
"6408660","6410320"," I think tomorrow just trades sideways."
"6410780","6413700"," Let's look at the implied move or let's look at the not implied move. "
"6413700","6415440"," Let's look at the options market."
"6415980","6417040"," We looked at this earlier."
"6418420","6419240"," This one. "
"6422380","6423600"," We'll do a red pen."
"6423840","6425400"," That'll make the bears happy customize."
"6426800","6428780"," I get a thick point. "
"6429740","6430880"," Chisel just tip."
"6431920","6432720"," Do a round tip."
"6434420","6439580"," You can see that we traded down into this. "
"6442020","6444620"," So you expect some kind of a move up here, right?"
"6446320","6447900"," And then a move down, right?"
"6448200","6449880"," Into this, not the best blindly."
"6453360","6454940"," Some more like this here, right?"
"6457850","6459830"," And then you're going to see some kind of a move up, right?"
"6460810","6463430"," Then a move down, way down, and then move up."
"6464110","6466130"," So this trend will continue. "
"6466370","6467970"," I'm doing this horribly right now."
"6469810","6470670"," Does that make sense?"
"6470670","6478650"," And so if we're closing here today, you'd see some kind of a continued trend and then a break"
"6478650","6478970"," higher."
"6479290","6479910"," So let's look at that. "
"6481590","6484890"," Let's look at a, this is just the options trades."
"6487650","6489970"," So let's look at it on a three month chart."
"6496250","6498090"," Let me see if I can extend this a little bit. "
"6500750","6501510"," Give me a second here."
"6521270","6530620"," Just these 7.30. Let me just say I'm trying to line all this up before we start doing some"
"6530620","6530860"," math."
"6531960","6533860"," Or just some how the market goes up and down. "
"6534740","6540180"," Breaking above right now, breaking through 372.60. Let's see if we can get through there."
"6546370","6548010"," Let's see if we can look higher here into the close."
"6548870","6550830"," 381 back on the table above here. "
"6551050","6553290"," Our one resistance, one above 381."
"6553750","6554930"," We're going to see if we can take that higher."
"6555690","6557770"," Let's look just crayon drawings. "
"6564120","6566440"," So this is that 380 area right here, right?"
"6566800","6567620"," Right in here."
"6570440","6571980"," Oh, hold on, let me clear that out."
"6576730","6579230"," This is that 380 area that we're in right here. "
"6580570","6585650"," So the implication would be that, or the implication from the options market is that we have a"
"6585650","6587430"," slight move up, right?"
"6588470","6595910"," As big tech is done doing their thing and big heavy waiters, that we're going to trade down, right"
"6595910","6603610"," up, down, and then this swing higher into, into end of quarter."
"6605410","6610150"," Now, there is some talk that Fr."
"6610790","6618300"," Spock M is saying that we're going to actually close the month and head straight down in something"
"6618300","6619040"," more like this. "
"6623760","6625800"," And then you'd see that blast off down below."
"6626220","6629180"," And this is implying that you would get like a Fed meeting."
"6629700","6631520"," Sorry, you get a Fed meeting here somewhere. "
"6632400","6633180"," Fed meeting."
"6633540","6635020"," I'm not this drawing sucks."
"6636060","6636820"," Fed meeting. "
"6637640","6639780"," And then we're not a Fed meeting."
"6639860","6640000"," Sorry."
"6640840","6641920"," I'm fucking this way. "
"6642020","6642860"," I have to do a better chart for this."
"6643240","6646380"," But anyways, that you at some point get that Fed pivot down below."
"6646580","6650180"," That's that 320 mark that I think Edison was talking about into Q3. "
"6650280","6651500"," I think he was saying 340 at most."
"6652700","6654260"," But this is what they're talking about."
"6654260","6658480"," Something, some kind of nasty, nasty is like this giant rip higher. "
"6659440","6666500"," Like this actually could be drawn like this to where you see like that move down something more"
"6666500","6668960"," like this, or we trade sideways."
"6670120","6673420"," And then you get that green close right here."
"6675680","6676940"," So that's the question, right?"
"6677160","6679660"," You get that green close or do you not get that green close?"
"6682060","6683740"," Even with that green close. "
"6684400","6691560"," If you had the the serious bloodbath in that serious bloodbath into Q4, if you had the green close"
"6691560","6696120"," and Q3, it leads to a longer bear market."
"6696400","6701600"," That's the real one problem is if you don't get a massive capitulate, you get orderly selling quote"
"6701600","6706080"," unquote from now into from right of our Q3."
"6706080","6711420"," If you get orderly selling, then it would be an extended bear market, i.e. an actual recession"
"6711420","6714540"," where you'd have like a green slightly green Q3. "
"6714940","6720080"," And then you would actually extend the market going down over into 2023."
"6720860","6723340"," You'd just see long, slow bleed out."
"6724180","6726660"," And you would have a couple of years of nastiness. "
"6727460","6735700"," If you had a price break of 350 traded down to 320 and actually started to have market collapse"
"6735700","6745600"," that situation or break of that 320, then you"
"6745600","6751260"," would then start seeing that 260 area, 280 area before end of year."
"6752080","6754840"," I think Edison was kind of leading towards that in a way."
"6755560","6757340"," I don't think 320 is that scenario. "
"6757500","6758040"," I think it's lower."
"6758220","6759620"," I think it's actually lower than 320."
"6759940","6761880"," You'd see an actual break of the market. "
"6761880","6763820"," You'd see a bank fail or something like that."
"6763820","6770740"," And you actually see a recovery faster, like a nine month type bear market, one year type bear"
"6770740","6771060"," market."
"6771600","6778440"," But if you do see a recovery in Q3 and then further declining Q4, that's the tough one. "
"6778600","6782240"," If you see the bounce off the weekly moving average in Q3, 350 ish."
"6782760","6788680"," Maybe we break below 340 bounce above bounce above trade higher into the end of Q3."
"6788680","6790920"," Then you come into the election season. "
"6791740","6797940"," And the volatility of election season, the weakness at the end of September into October, November."
"6798840","6800880"," Then you'd see that nasty Q4."
"6801120","6802560"," It was just like brutal Q4. "
"6803000","6806140"," Q4 sells down into January, February, March."
"6807080","6809100"," And that's when you would see an actual bottom."
"6809740","6814460"," And then that recovery would probably take anywhere from three months to a year. "
"6814460","6818920"," That puts you into 2024, which is fucking brutal."
"6818920","6826720"," You're talking about two full years of bear market plus to plus recovery, like restart starting,"
"6826720","6829680"," restarting, checking, and then actually making a move higher."
"6830360","6837510"," But it's kind of wild. "
"6839850","6842170"," Two eighties bottom by next FMC."
"6848910","6850670"," I'm reading what you guys are saying right now."
"6853900","6854960"," Yeah, I'm not anti. "
"6855260","6855760"," I'm not anti."
"6858880","6859620"," I'm not anti."
"6859620","6861120"," This isn't everything bubble. "
"6861420","6861800"," And I'm not."
"6861880","6863320"," I'm not anti on."
"6863780","6864240"," I'm not. "
"6864420","6865820"," I'm open to both scenarios."
"6865820","6867520"," I'm open to the fast scenario."
"6868620","6873500"," My preference as a bowl is that we get the fast scenario that we slam it down in. "
"6873540","6874820"," And we're done in nine months."
"6875180","6875760"," That's my preference."
"6877820","6883320"," Is that fast and done any bowl that I know that that has money, like lots of money. "
"6885000","6885520"," Perfers."
"6885520","6887480"," That's a fast, quick death."
"6888500","6890680"," Most of my friends that buy stock. "
"6891960","6893520"," They're on the sidelines just waiting."
"6895720","6897040"," So they want it to be fast."
"6898200","6899940"," If it's long and drawn out. "
"6900920","6902860"," It's not it's even nastier."
"6903020","6905020"," You guys go right back in history and look at you."
"6905160","6906260"," You can look at both examples. "
"6906640","6913480"," You can look at the long drawn out example and the short example and the long and drawn out"
"6913480","6914160"," example."
"6914600","6920240"," I mean, they suck."
"6922120","6923660"," They really suck. "
"6924580","6925580"," They're not fun."
"6925580","6927560"," In any way, shape, form."
"6927700","6932420"," As a matter of fact, I would pause it that if you took if it was the long road. "
"6933960","6940060"," If it was like the long road, like the it takes until mid 2024."
"6941000","6942600"," To late 2024."
"6945260","6947800"," And then plus the recovery on top of that. "
"6948640","6951940"," You'd probably see a lot of retail leave the market."
"6953200","6956700"," Just in general, I would think even bears and bulls lesser day trader."
"6957520","6959120"," Or or in the market. "
"6959140","6960860"," I don't think I think that you'd see."
"6963340","6964680"," It's I don't even know if it's demand."
"6965080","6968040"," You see demand destruction of retail, certainly. "
"6969420","6973040"," Just because they don't feel like it or they care for it."
"6977240","6979500"," If it was a fast one, I think you'd see."
"6982160","6987480"," You'd see a rip that's never been easy if you see a blowout like and you saw it in 2020. "
"6987840","6989220"," If you saw like a fast."
"6990840","6993020"," Dump and that could be tied to."
"6994440","6998740"," That could be tied to if we're not going to go in a recession where they just dump it hard"
"6998740","7000920"," and fast as deep as they can get it. "
"7000920","7002200"," Make everybody fearful."
"7002920","7007380"," Nobody buys that bottom banks do buy that bottom and then tell you to come back and buy it."
"7008320","7010100"," So I think both are still in the table. "
"7010240","7011440"," It's hard to say that."
"7012400","7013040"," It's hard."
"7013040","7015720"," It's hard to say that either one is confirmed at this point. "
"7021630","7025570"," But I'm saying we're going to exit technical bear market before midterms and have another bear"
"7025570","7026530"," market next year."
"7027430","7029150"," That's the long that's the long one."
"7031090","7032810"," I don't mind the destruction. "
"7034510","7035270"," I'm old enough."
"7035550","7037130"," I liked I liked 2000."
"7037690","7040430"," I liked 2007 2008. "
"7041510","7044030"," Those those were actually good resets."
"7044710","7047010"," They're not a negative in any way shape or form."
"7047630","7048810"," I don't view them as negative. "
"7049210","7052890"," I didn't want to buy the market in 2021 at all."
"7062720","7064360"," So you've got the court to Marcus."
"7064600","7065420"," You've got the caller. "
"7065920","7066000"," Yeah."
"7066120","7066960"," 405 C."
"7068160","7069520"," And that makes sense."
"7071360","7074060"," 3550 or 3580 makes sense as well. "
"7074480","7075060"," Oh, no shit."
"7075520","7076020"," 3020."
"7076560","7078500"," No, it doesn't change. "
"7078700","7079760"," That is my projection."
"7080280","7084740"," If you go back even in my last part, any of my previous videos, that's my projection right there."
"7085400","7089900"," That shows you the slightly green and it shows you the low end at 3200. "
"7091100","7091980"," Without a doubt."
"7093720","7095860"," That actually fits my view of Q three."
"7101020","7105400"," Yeah, Edison Carter saying meeting on a generation of retail traders cleaned out all our 2000s"
"7105400","7105600"," 2008s. "
"7106320","7106740"," You know the drill."
"7107060","7108400"," Yeah, that's the other side of it."
"7108440","7109800"," Most people don't talk about that stuff. "
"7111460","7115520"," And the stuff that I was just talking about that Edison just commented what I was talking about was"
"7115520","7117200"," if you have."
"7117220","7121900"," So you get these long term bulls and they want the fast dump."
"7122180","7122680"," They want the dump. "
"7122860","7123540"," They want the nine month."
"7125620","7126760"," They want the nine month."
"7128460","7131120"," They want the they want the nine month quick, fast, clean. "
"7131320","7131580"," It's done."
"7131680","7132160"," It's over."
"7132540","7133620"," They can jump back in. "
"7134000","7135080"," Big rip roaring rally."
"7135480","7136480"," Market goes all the time."
"7136580","7136780"," You highs. "
"7138040","7141520"," If you go back to like the Allah 2000, Allah 2008."
"7142800","7144100"," Markets that took time."
"7144880","7146660"," You will see like that. "
"7146860","7149480"," That that that generation of retail investor."
"7150180","7150820"," They disappear."
"7151420","7152160"," They go away. "
"7152680","7155300"," I don't know how many of you how long some of you have been trading."
"7156220","7158520"," If you look back to like the Yahoo days."
"7159340","7161220"," If any of you remember the Yahoo days. "
"7162760","7164740"," It was it was really bizarre."
"7165100","7165880"," They had so."
"7167960","7169360"," I'll try to pull up some archives. "
"7170020","7172040"," There are some archives of the old Yahoo days."
"7172660","7177100"," But the old Yahoo days they were everything that you see on Twitter."
"7177320","7179140"," Now let's say let's use Twitter as an example. "
"7179140","7181340"," Where something's behind a paywall."
"7182000","7183440"," And you'll get like monthly newsletters."
"7184480","7186020"," And you'll get people that post like. "
"7187620","7189220"," Spreadsheets and all this other information."
"7190000","7192980"," There used to be chat rooms on Yahoo."
"7194040","7196060"," I've done totally dating myself now. "
"7196280","7200220"," There used to be chat rooms and stuff on Yahoo way back in the day."
"7200460","7204320"," And archives of stats and all this other nonsense."
"7204320","7205160"," Not nonsense but. "
"7206300","7209540"," Just stats and where we go and all everything you see."
"7209840","7210720"," Everything you see."
"7211140","7212740"," Like pretty on Twitter. "
"7213320","7214760"," Was like really rough looking."
"7215160","7216060"," It looked like it."
"7216140","7219680"," It looked like an Excel and a Microsoft word. "
"7220620","7221200"," Documents."
"7222180","7224340"," With huge discussions around the stuff."
"7224720","7225920"," Oh eight oh seven. "
"7226300","7227920"," I can talk about that stuff at least."
"7229960","7234080"," You would see you saw that stuff and then it was crazy because."
"7234080","7236080"," These are all active boards. "
"7236480","7237460"," All active communities."
"7238620","7240980"," And then then you just saw."
"7241640","7242780"," You just saw. "
"7243800","7245180"," Like they just died."
"7246020","7246860"," Geo cities."
"7248920","7249600"," You just saw. "
"7249960","7251300"," And then it was really weird."
"7251480","7252400"," There was no real place."
"7252720","7254300"," You saw like bots come in. "
"7255000","7256540"," It was really fucking weird."
"7257120","7257540"," And then."
"7258100","7258940"," I remember. "
"7259280","7261640"," I remember when Stock Quits came online."
"7261640","7265220"," And I was in of course Twitter."
"7265720","7267920"," Well Wall Street Beth started to rain. "
"7268400","7269800"," Twitter was starting to rain."
"7270420","7272960"," And then Stock Quits came into being."
"7273460","7274720"," And I remember thinking about. "
"7275080","7276780"," At that time I was thinking I was like man I was like."
"7277140","7277900"," It's all the same shit."
"7278160","7278460"," It's just. "
"7279800","7280780"," Glossier I guess."
"7281480","7283320"," Or nicer or cleaner."
"7283920","7284200"," More succinct. "
"7284640","7285000"," I don't know."
"7285560","7286800"," Exactly how to describe."
"7287440","7288480"," That experience. "
"7291360","7293140"," I wasn't a part of 2000."
"7293860","7294580"," I wasn't."
"7294660","7297040"," I wasn't involved at all in the 2000 2001. "
"7298360","7300880"," I was in the military then in college and stuff."
"7301080","7302320"," But in 2007 2008."
"7303580","7304680"," I was just starting. "
"7306060","7306400"," To."
"7308080","7310300"," Get involved in investing and stuff like that."
"7313180","7314460"," Matter of fact I was in. "
"7314660","7317840"," Matter of fact I was an original buyer of Bitcoin when it was worthless."
"7319680","7320880"," I'd be rich right now."
"7320880","7321900"," If I'd ever held that stuff. "
"7322880","7323760"," Filthy fucking rich."
"7324480","7325160"," Well now right now."
"7326320","7330200"," I think I think the first rip of Bitcoin went to 7,000 right. "
"7330500","7330860"," If I remember."
"7331740","7335480"," But I was pre that I was back when it was like pennies and dollars and quarters."
"7335840","7337600"," I was using it to buy drugs to go to Burning Man. "
"7339920","7341360"," Oh yeah back in the day."
"7341660","7342580"," Sure you get good drugs."
"7343400","7344200"," Good drugs. "
"7345020","7345400"," There's required."
"7347220","7348740"," Not like cocaine and that kind of stuff."
"7350680","7351960"," None of those bad drugs. "
"7358980","7359540"," If you."
"7359680","7362920"," So back in the day you some of you guys noticed, most of you guys might not notice."
"7363740","7366440"," So I probably shouldn't be commenting on this stuff. "
"7366640","7367540"," But back in the day."
"7368300","7371880"," You like you have an impression that only certain people do drugs and stuff."
"7372040","7372700"," I can assure you. "
"7373860","7377080"," I can assure you that I was at the occupy Wall Street Burning Man."
"7377080","7383000"," I can assure you that very wealthy people, smart tech people were using Bitcoin."
"7384160","7387540"," Back in the day to buy a very expensive drugs. "
"7392360","7396000"," And they were using Bitcoin Silk Road."
"7396380","7397460"," I use Silk Road."
"7399600","7400600"," Depy a baby. "
"7404540","7408360"," Yeah if I you wouldn't believe some of the stories to have about Bitcoin."
"7408360","7410420"," You would not believe me."
"7413720","7414620"," Would not. "
"7416560","7417660"," I bear fact."
"7419120","7421420"," Any of you that should probably shouldn't say this."
"7422280","7423940"," I had a friend in Park City. "
"7424640","7425760"," He was an engineer."
"7426080","7428680"," He was mining Bitcoin in 2004."
"7430480","7431760"," 2003 2001. "
"7432300","7433060"," No 2004."
"7434320","7435320"," 2003 2004."
"7436120","7439540"," He was stealing the server time at PC TV. "
"7440400","7443360"," Probably should say that because it get pretty good a prison for that even today."
"7445120","7447100"," When Bitcoin was worth fucking nothing."
"7447480","7452200"," And nobody was buying Bitcoin back then. "
"7452340","7453060"," It was very rare."
"7454040","7455280"," But people were doing it."
"7457840","7459600"," Look at that selling off in the clothes. "
"7459920","7461500"," Look at that driving this and nothing in the clothes."
"7462320","7462960"," So anyways."
"7463200","7466280"," My only point behind that is that as we go through these cycles. "
"7468280","7469180"," What do you expect?"
"7469420","7472400"," You want to start thinking about the stuff when we get into quarter ends, quarter closes."
"7472420","7474440"," You want to look back in the previous quarter."
"7474660","7479320"," You want to look back in previous years and have a viewpoint as to what you think is going to"
"7479320","7481420"," happen in the upcoming quarter. "
"7481720","7484700"," Have that viewpoint as you go through the weekend."
"7485560","7488540"," If you're going to have a vacation or whatever, you got your vacation."
"7489400","7491760"," If this is always a good place, right?"
"7492360","7497500"," If you work a job, if you own a business, if you trade the stock market. "
"7497900","7499540"," It's a very good place at a quarter end."
"7500120","7507600"," Just take a look at the next quarter and try to look at all the possibilities and have a trading"
"7507600","7510080"," plan for the next quarter."
"7510540","7513720"," Start to say, well, what's my long term view for the next three months?"
"7514440","7516720"," What's the low that I could expect?"
"7518040","7522020"," It's pretty simple to find a low for the quarter. "
"7522400","7526140"," That's simple, but an implied range for the quarter."
"7528810","7532050"," They published an implied range for the quarter, but it's all bullshit."
"7533330","7535290"," But you're going to be looking for..."
"7535290","7537290"," I'm only going to be looking for..."
"7538130","7541540"," So first off, Big Marcus said that we have..."
"7541890","7543170"," Let's actually bring something else up. "
"7544330","7548630"," I think Marcus said 400 and 300, right?"
"7549170","7549970"," As an implied range."
"7549970","7551010"," That makes sense to me."
"7551170","7552750"," That sounds reasonable to me. "
"7554470","7556190"," Sounds like what we're going to do."
"7556770","7558110"," We are selling off from the close."
"7558630","7559690"," So I'm going to get rid of..."
"7559690","7560610"," I'm going to show you something here. "
"7561130","7562510"," I'm going to show you..."
"7562510","7564030"," Yeah, I'm going to get an SPX."
"7568050","7569470"," So that's just a thing to look at."
"7570090","7572170"," As a matter of fact, this is the same chart that I showed earlier. "
"7573570","7574290"," Same lines."
"7575550","7577150"," 10% down move, right?"
"7577510","7578730"," Well, that's 12% right there."
"7579390","7580690"," We'll just throw that in the trash. "
"7582510","7584110"," So we were talking about this this morning."
"7584210","7584930"," It's just joining us."
"7585550","7589530"," I was talking about this being my target, my low target down here, right?"
"7590470","7591490"," So let's just move this up. "
"7591710","7593170"," Let's just do the JPM caller."
"7593410","7595210"," We got 400 above, right?"
"7595410","7595870"," That's close enough."
"7596770","7597830"," You don't have to get that fucking close. "
"7598150","7598490"," Close enough."
"7598970","7601810"," We have got 3000 down below."
"7602970","7605450"," So this is what we're looking for, right?"
"7606590","7608130"," 4, 2, 3."
"7609870","7616770"," Say if you ask yourself, can I handle a move down to 300?"
"7617470","7618510"," I don't think we get that low. "
"7618590","7619450"," I think we get 300, 300."
"7620110","7621330"," We get a dip below there for a minute."
"7621630","7622090"," That's fine. "
"7622750","7624830"," That's the hand grades and horse shoes looking at a quarter, right?"
"7625950","7628630"," We're going to look at September down here, right?"
"7629730","7630610"," September 30th."
"7631270","7632390"," This is our implied move."
"7632470","7633830"," It's a pretty big implied move, right?"
"7634710","7636410"," You can start to make your own deviations. "
"7636570","7641510"," Like instead of just saying, what is the standard deviation, you can actually start to look over"
"7641510","7645370"," the weekend, spend some time and say, what do I think we're going to trade, right?"
"7646990","7649850"," Me personally, I think we've traded 320, right?"
"7652670","7657810"," Unless we've got headline news or we break something and all kinds of shit we can all bring up."
"7658930","7659370"," 4000."
"7660190","7661550"," You can probably trade up here to 420. "
"7661930","7663110"," That's possible possibility."
"7663230","7666710"," We trade up here, right out of range, below range to me at least."
"7667530","7668390"," I could see that. "
"7668590","7671110"," I could see an attempt to crack this at some point."
"7672230","7677890"," So if you're along this market, do you take at some point in the next three months is the big"
"7677890","7678230"," question."
"7678230","7680030"," Do you think where we are right now?"
"7680710","7682690"," Can we trade down here to 3,200?"
"7683110","7684350"," Yeah, there's a high likelihood of it. "
"7684790","7686390"," When would you want to buy those puts?"
"7686950","7687810"," Probably up around 4000."
"7688730","7692260"," Probably around 420 that we can trade down here, right?"
"7692870","7693290"," Does that make sense?"
"7693630","7696850"," So if we start even hitting down here, take some longs here."
"7697370","7703210"," So start to think about this over the weekend where the implied move is for the next quarter. "
"7703610","7705030"," JPM saying it's down here."
"7705030","7709130"," I think JPM or someone said they expect to mark to go up."
"7709470","7714690"," I do want you to know that the JPM Collar does not imply that we trade down here. "
"7715290","7720470"," We have seen that in the past years, we've seen the JPM Collar be a losing trade."
"7721270","7725490"," Just to hedge the market, we could move up here and the JPM Collar means nothing, believe it or"
"7725490","7725750"," not."
"7727590","7733550"," But just using the JPM Collar as where we think we're trading, this is the implied move. "
"7733550","7736090"," This is your implied move for the next three months."
"7736810","7738130"," Start to think about that."
"7738430","7742870"," Think about this for placing your trades. "
"7743310","7746210"," You could eat for how high we are right now in the implied move."
"7746650","7752390"," You could probably put a put spread on or a putback spread down that expires sometime in September."
"7753070","7755910"," That will trade down to 3,000. "
"7756450","7757570"," Not a bad trade."
"7757570","7764530"," If you bought a putback or a ratio spread in here and we ended up trading higher, anything above 4 "
"7764530","7770970",",000 or 4,200, more than likely would not only be break even but still print you a slightly green"
"7770970","7774930"," putback spread and print huge dollars at some point down here."
"7775650","7777050"," So think about that for Q3. "
"7778010","7783510"," Notice that there's not, we didn't see a bunch of hedging come in here and a bunch of long calls"
"7783510","7784050"," up here."
"7784610","7785410"," Let me clear all this out."
"7786210","7791610"," I want you to notice that today, this week and even into OPEX, we didn't see. "
"7792610","7796370"," We didn't see any kind of huge long calls up here."
"7796370","7798810"," We didn't see our hedging more in the money."
"7799930","7804350"," So IE implying that we're getting a move that's in this zone here. "
"7805650","7807390"," It's actually down below."
"7807390","7814850"," So take that into consideration in the next three months with that big banks are implying a move"
"7814850","7818810"," lower controlled destruction lower into the Q3."
"7820330","7821090"," Close that out. "
"7822450","7823070"," Look at that."
"7823210","7824750"," Just pinning it right in the fucking bell."
"7825310","7826390"," Got one minute left. "
"7826750","7827650"," Please join me tomorrow."
"7827830","7829710"," We'll be live streaming tomorrow one last day."
"7830070","7831650"," Let me know if you're long or short in the close. "
"7832410","7835630"," I'm not going to enter any calls into the bell."
"7835630","7840630"," I do want you to know that for the first that there are 180,000."
"7842070","7842990"," 181,000. "
"7843090","7846130"," A bunch of people are buying the clothes right now for 380 C."
"7846570","7849490"," There are $1.40. A little rich for my blood for tomorrow."
"7849910","7854330"," So that does mean that the dealers are pricing it in pricing in that we do trade higher into"
"7854330","7854730"," tomorrow."
"7855510","7858730"," That's pretty, that's a pretty expensive call for tomorrow. "
"7858730","7863950"," Three E.C. for two for two D or for three D or three strikes away."
"7864210","7864950"," I think that's a little pricey."
"7865890","7868430"," So I'm going to wait until open tomorrow to buy some calls. "
"7868490","7870410"," If I can, hopefully don't live it up tomorrow."
"7871270","7871850"," We might."
"7872170","7874110"," I don't know what to say on that on that aspect. "
"7874310","7878010"," Now they're trading down a $1.20. I'm going to look for the bell tomorrow."
"7878010","7881110"," I'm going to get on a smaller thing where you guys get away from me here for you."
"7881250","7881930"," Hang up with me. "
"7882690","7884210"," Please like and subscribe these videos."
"7884210","7891310"," Let me wait for tomorrow is I really want to see if we can get this lower open tomorrow right"
"7891310","7891970"," down in here."
"7892090","7892950"," Three sixty seven. "
"7893210","7898390"," If we, if we can't, if we, if we come right off the open, I'll buy the open hopefully and"
"7898390","7900090"," be out of a trade by 10 30 in the morning."
"7901410","7902130"," All right."
"7902750","7906230"," With all that said, hope you all have a wonderful to close this out. "
"7907030","7908090"," Hold on here."
"7908530","7908910"," Uh oh."
"7909490","7910870"," Hey, I closed everything here. "
"7911370","7912810"," You make this larger here."
"7914190","7920470"," We asked me some questions before I, before I stopped the, uh, the live stream for today."
"7920810","7922530"," Why is it called JPM caller?"
"7923550","7925910"," Uh no, it's C O L A R."
"7926110","7928530"," So a caller trade is a hedge in the market. "
"7929910","7931730"," And it's an old school hedge."
"7931970","7935670"," There are better ways to hedge the market, but, uh, it works for them."
"7936490","7939290"," Uh, they, what they know, they're long and short. "
"7939650","7940290"," They pay for the."
"7940750","7941150"," Okay."
"7941770","7943790"," I'll, you know, I'll do is I'll do a post for this. "
"7944650","7946890"," They pay for one side of the trade with the other."
"7948950","7951150"," Uh, you're long for this, uh, close."
"7951450","7951590"," Yeah. "
"7951870","7952210"," I'm flat."
"7952410","7955730"," I've got calls still out there, but they're not from day trading."
"7956170","7957890"," I'm you earnings important today. "

"7967390","7968950"," Uh, my go to is PBR."
"7969430","7972670"," My second favorite bear would be, uh, believe it or not."
"7975410","7979070"," Um, man, I got a bunch of great bears that I love. "
"7979210","7981510"," Like, like lawn mowing bear PBR."
"7982110","7985170"," Uh, but I drink all kind of a fat tire, of course."
"7985390","7987570"," Like if I was like traveling fat tire. "
"7988190","7991770"," Uh, mostly I like, uh, west coast bears, uh, western bears."

"8003450","8005710"," I appreciate how you guys show up to the stream."
"8005910","8007170"," I'll be back again tomorrow."
"8007930","8011470"," Uh, I'll do a post on what a caller means, what it is. "
"8011970","8015750"," Not the JPM car specifically, but basically what basically we're doing is."
"8016430","8018190"," Uh, how do I do this real quick?"
"8021450","8024030"," This is, uh, this is a pretty rock guy thing to do."
"8024470","8026770"," Uh, so basically we can do this real quick. "
"8027050","8027710"," This is pretty simple."
"8027890","8027910"," Ready?"
"8029350","8029990"," Hold on here."
"8030610","8032590"," I don't know why this isn't working. "
"8033570","8037450"," Uh, let's go to, hold on a second here."
"8038610","8039190"," Uh oh."
"8040130","8040670"," Hold on a second. "
"8040990","8043730"," I'm getting some slowing, getting some slowdown over here."
"8046860","8047660"," Hold on here."
"8050360","8050600"," Okay. "
"8050900","8051520"," Hold on one second here."
"8051520","8054740"," Ah, I got something for you."
"8054820","8055020"," Hold on. "
"8058660","8064640"," I'm going to show you what I mean by a, by a pay for a trade to buy a trade."
"8065780","8066220"," Okay."
"8066620","8068660"," So, a caller trade is basically like this. "
"8070560","8074780"," So, let me give you like the, the dumb ends, the cave van explanation, right?"
"8075060","8077040"," So, if we're, we start right here, right?"
"8078640","8080020"," Let's say we start right here."
"8082540","8084300"," And I want to put a caller on."
"8086460","8088840"," So, I can long the market right here, right?"
"8089040","8090900"," And, and short the market, believe it or not. "
"8091700","8094180"," Uh, so, the long side of that trade, right?"
"8094700","8098220"," Will pay for me to, to, to, for the short side of this trade over here."
"8098940","8099900"," I don't know if we'll explain this correctly."
"8101700","8106000"," So, what I'll do is how, how, how I start that trade is, I'll sell some puts down here, right?"
"8107140","8110780"," So, this is, I sell puts here, right?"
"8110780","8111580"," Where we start, right?"
"8111680","8113900"," I'm going to sell some puts, right?"
"8114260","8115480"," So, we're going to move the market up. "
"8117520","8121100"," And then I'm going to, and then I'm going to sell calls above here, right?"
"8121280","8126840"," And you use the money to fund the trade lower into puts down below, if that makes any sense."
"8130900","8131640"," Just say goodbye."
"8133520","8134860"," You guys have a great day. "
"8135140","8136180"," I'm going to check it with you guys later."
"8136640","8137480"," I'll see you guys tomorrow."
"8138080","8141380"," Just look up at the JPM, don't look up the JPM call, just look up the caller trade. "
"8141380","8143180"," That's going to explain it better to you."
"8143320","8145100"," So, one side of the trade pays for the other side of the trade."
"8145840","8152680"," It's wag the dog, it's when, right now it's wag, right now it's wag the dog, where the will trade,"
"8152860","8158440"," will trade up and down in a certain move while holding both sides of that trade and both sides in"
"8158440","8159940"," a printing, both sides of that trade. "
"8162320","8165660"," I didn't do that right because I should have shown, I should have shown like a trade higher and"
"8165660","8167240"," lower of the starting point, not just up."
"8167240","8167680"," Thanks for watching. "
