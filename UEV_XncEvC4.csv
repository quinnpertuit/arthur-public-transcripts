"2820","455940"," This leader is provided to permit the Just going"
"455940","456720"," to stop in here."
"456900","457780"," Talk to you guys briefly."
"459000","460900"," If you guys are following the stream right now. "
"461660","463220"," A couple things."
"464180","467720"," So on this hourly trigger here this morning, you know the drill, right?"
"468860","470780"," I want you to pay attention to two things."
"471820","474200"," When we come down in the hourly trigger, you want to see a bounce, right?"
"474920","476280"," If you're a bull, at least you want to see a bounce. "
"476280","479940"," If you're a bear, you want to see the break below confirmation of the downside."
"481580","489620"," Another key point here, though, is the 29 and the 129 or 30 and 129 or 27, whatever you're using."
"490240","492020"," Pay attention to price in these. "
"492280","496000"," These two here, this white and red line are going to be important."
"497240","499880"," And its relationship to price is important."
"500920","505440"," So the idea here being is we're getting the bounce right now on the early trigger. "
"505440","506500"," You can see it right here."
"507000","509940"," But price is still not above the one and five."
"510820","512780"," So you want to pay attention to that. "
"513100","515780"," The early trigger here is acting as support right now."
"515840","518400"," But the one and five is telling you that velocity is to the downside."
"519419","526900"," So pay attention to price in its relationship to these three triggers as the morning continues on. "
"526900","531480"," You're looking, you don't want to be taking along here just because you bounced off the HT."
"531880","538680"," Price is still below the five minute, 27 EMA and the 129 EMA and the five minute chart."
"538980","543420"," So the example I'm trying to make to you, the point I'm trying to make to you is that you"
"543420","544380"," get the bounce right here. "
"547740","554410"," You're getting the bounce right here, but still even with that bounce, you want to see price get"
"554410","554670"," above."
"554670","556770"," You want the confirmation on the HT."
"557390","564270"," You want to see the price get above the one and the five and then trade and confirm off that"
"564270","565630"," one and five. "
"568490","573590"," My God, I've got some really bad allergies this morning, but we've got rain and smog and all kinds"
"573590","576210"," of nastiness going on here like there was in New York."
"577290","582510"," So the idea being here that even if we catch the bounce here, you would still want to see this"
"582510","583330"," come back up."
"583330","586710"," And you want to see price first confirmed to move higher. "
"587270","589870"," See the first confirmation down here in the hourly trigger."
"590450","593250"," Let's say we can get up here, come back down, right?"
"593510","594330"," You're slamming in here."
"594610","599070"," You're not taking that long position until you get confirmation right there. "
"599510","599950"," So make sense."
"600310","601230"," Don't get trapped in here."
"601710","606590"," We could trap in this nonsense here because this can roll right down on you before you know we're"
"606590","607550"," selling the market here. "
"607550","612570"," So it's not a complicated day, but take the time today where we are."
"613670","621170"," Take the time this morning to pay attention to or try to try to work."
"621770","625490"," A lot of times we trade just the white and the red, right?"
"626350","634530"," Take the time today to to watch the interplay between a third trigger, the hourly trigger is an"
"634530","635550"," important one. "
"635550","636610"," Sellers love."
"637170","639510"," We've sold off this hourly trigger to the downside."
"640470","644890"," Just if we flip the chart upside out, right side up, we're selling the market, we're selling off"
"644890","645590"," the HD. "
"646110","651630"," If we're buying the market, we're taking the trade to the upside off the HD as well, right?"
"652190","655390"," So this thing right here is like a magnet that we trade off."
"655890","660930"," So I want you to be paying attention to this because as you get, as this tool rolls out, this"
"660930","663730"," is going to be a very important part of the puzzle for you."
"664450","665410"," And you're trading. "
"666130","668050"," So pay attention to this cross right here."
"668170","670090"," Right now, this cross is saying we're bears, right?"
"670550","673090"," Even though we're getting a bounce off the HD."
"673470","676690"," So I wouldn't personally have a position here. "
"677150","678390"," I would let this play out."
"678770","681790"," I kind of view this right now as a box right here."
"683730","688770"," And a no man's land going on in here until we get a directional sign here, right?"
"688770","690410"," The white and the red come down. "
"690610","695430"," Price follows to the downside or the white and red come up and we trade to the upside."
"695870","698790"," So remember that as we trade this today."
"733160","737840"," One last note would be to one last note here would be to make sure you're helping your fellow"
