"111260","112160"," Huge day."
"113120","118300"," They might not tell you that on Twitter but if you're a finance guy or gal or them or whatever"
"118300","122280"," they trust is a big day for people in the market. "
"122280","123460"," They look forward to this day."

"131080","132200"," I hope everybody's doing well this morning."
"132220","133300"," Let's not go through real quick."
"133320","134320"," This is a special day, right?"
"134800","137080"," I'm going to say hello to Gerald Ed Jafar. "
"137300","137840"," Pays on."
"138060","138620"," Biggie, baby."
"138860","139640"," Good to see you, Christian. "

"153840","158280"," Iden, Brandon, Ryan, Jeff, Clapp, and Konstantinos, Jeremy, Winky."
"158860","159280"," What's up, brother?"
"160080","160300"," Fisted."

"174240","175440"," Ed Medford guy."
"175940","177540"," The Medford guy's here from Massachusetts."
"178320","179460"," Oh, fuck, we're all fucked up. "
"179600","180320"," The Massels are here."
"181340","181940"," Good morning."
"182080","183080"," I should have said that, right?"
"183200","184320"," I said a fuck in the first minute. "
"184440","185340"," I'm going to get demonetized."
"185420","187520"," If I am demonetized, I have to delete that beep."
"188980","194760"," Biggie, Tom Pacheco, James, Charlie, Blind Nestle, Craig, everybody's here this morning. "
"195220","195580"," Wow."
"198140","200100"," He just closed some calls on some individual names."
"200320","200920"," Garrett, good morning. "
"201080","206180"," S.O.S. shouldn't took James, Dejan, Chase, good morning, Michael, Danny."
"206400","207600"," We have some time here this morning."
"208240","209660"," So we'll just take it easy here for a minute. "
"210220","212160"," We'll switch right over so you can see stuff."
"212360","212880"," What's going on?"
"213540","214660"," T-Chron, good morning."
"215280","217400"," Jasmine, Kalo, Scott, Ryan, Ignatio. "
"217720","219380"," Holy shit, people are showing up."
"220040","222180"," James Buchanan, the king cows here."
"222420","224200"," Matthew, Ali Baba. "
"224640","225180"," Good to see you."
"225300","226580"," R.S. Aussie, Medford guy."
"227680","227900"," Good morning. "
"228480","229660"," K.G.M. Good morning, Everton."
"231200","231720"," All right."
"231860","232000"," Let's talk. "
"232080","233100"," We're talking about Tesla today too."
"233960","235080"," So it's a big market day."
"236440","237500"," Let's see S&P 500 days. "
"237680","238680"," This is a NASDAQ day."
"239260","240980"," This is all your individual ticker day."
"241400","243620"," Backward-dation in the VIX day too, right?"
"243920","247520"," VIX bulls are like just cursing this morning. "
"248220","248960"," I bet, I think."
"250160","251780"," So we'll switch right over right now."
"251880","254480"," We're going to go to the livestream here. "
"255600","258399"," Let me put me post this to Twitter real quick."
"259079","263700"," The, hold on, let me just mute this here."
"264840","266400"," Am I in 1080p this morning?"
"267140","269000"," My fucking street, so I shouldn't be swearing. "
"270220","270780"," I'm not."
"271300","273420"," Again, I'm not in 1080p, whatever."
"273760","274700"," We'll let it slide one more day. "
"276080","277720"," But we'll share this."
"278040","278960"," I'm so pissed off."
"279960","282880"," It's like streamlabs need to get a shotgun like PayPal. "
"283700","285800"," I got a funny story for him before he gets started this morning."
"286160","293520"," I'll repeat this later but I won my fight with PayPal, which I'm pretty happy with."
"296020","303460"," I had a PayPal saga going on and I beat my case with PayPal, which is awesome. "
"303940","307020"," But still, I'm not on the fence if I stay with PayPal or not."
"308800","310500"," But PayPal, man, they're bad."
"310800","315520"," PayPal, at any moment they can just come right in and be like, we're going to seize everything you"
"315520","315740"," have. "
"316680","318380"," Really fucked up situation."
"323340","324480"," It's really fucked up."
"324660","326940"," So it's weird. "
"327220","332420"," I started refunding people and then I have to, I'll go through some names later to you who got"
"332420","333040"," refunded."
"337710","343220"," We'll go through, hold on here."
"347080","347940"," It's kind of crazy. "
"348320","352760"," So they didn't release all my money and told me everything was fine."
"352980","353180"," Whatever."
"354960","356340"," We'll talk about that another time. "
"356580","358340"," So if you donate, you can donate to PayPal again."
"358540","360340"," There's a little description and a little box down below."
"361800","364300"," Now, without it said, turn the old shit off. "
"364380","365240"," We're going to get right into it."
"367240","368740"," So you see this little bump down here."
"368820","369340"," We need to see this. "
"369500","371520"," Before we even get anything else, we'll end up talking about stuff."
"371720","373640"," But see down here is this 414 here."
"374340","375480"," We're going to support down here at 413. "
"376040","379560"," Then this weird wonky duck, kind of a thing down here, 412."
"380960","384940"," To be aware of that, I'm going to expect some grind down here."
"387210","389290"," You can possibly buy some spreads here right now. "
"391690","393230"," Better price is probably down to 412."
"394330","396130"," And there's nothing saying we can't trade lower."
"396810","398110"," Now, just looking at this right here, right?"
"398290","401170"," This support, you can see that this support is moved up here to 412. "
"402010","403370"," It's kind of a weird day with support levels."
"405310","409430"," Now, if we get some bad news, we'll talk about bad news, good news and how far down we can"
"409430","410070"," sell."
"410070","412070"," It is really weird down here too, 408. "
"413130","414770"," Lots of interest down there, 408."
"415410","418530"," Lots of interest down here, 404, not quite 405."
"420430","425050"," So I think that the implication behind this is even 398. "
"425630","430330"," The reason I'm going to point this out to you right off the bat this morning is that there's some"
"430330","435150"," implication that if we trade down levels, there's going to be some spikes from volatility."
"435150","438050"," You might see a spike down to 408 instead of 410."
"438770","440970"," You might see a spike down to 412 instead of 415. "
"441690","443710"," You know, repetitively down the list there."
"443870","445070"," To 405, it might be 404."
"445670","446650"," 400 might be 398. "
"447810","449810"," I'll tell you how the news comes out today."
"451430","452770"," So we'll get into that this morning."
"453410","456050"," I'll leave this up for you on the screen. "
"456210","457590"," We'll bounce around this morning."
"458430","460430"," And we're going to talk for the next about next hour."
"460430","463230"," So if you're out there, you're a trainer and investor, right?"
"463790","465890"," This is not the time to be fucking around the market. "
"468690","474310"," Yesterday, I didn't want to come on live stream yesterday because there's a lot of..."
"474310","475130"," It's not fuckery."
"475270","477830"," It's a lot of lock it in bowls, lock it in bears."
"478710","480370"," There's some money we made in there yesterday. "
"481050","483330"," There's a beautiful run up on the open yesterday."
"484050","488110"," A couple of dips to buy yesterday, a couple of sell signals yesterday."
"488110","493310"," But none of them really panned out even the sell yesterday that should have sold the market down"
"493310","496690"," with that fake Twitter report that we were getting 75 VPS. "
"498150","500590"," Even that report should have sold the market down."
"501010","502790"," And of course, it didn't, right?"
"502990","506690"," We got a hair trigger alarm to sell the market violently and it bounced right back."
"506990","511789"," Under normal circumstances, that would have sold off, even with a fake report. "
"511789","517370"," The reason it didn't, it bounced is because of the, because of the options market basically."
"518190","519470"," And of course, the hair trigger."
"519730","523770"," But the options market is stopping that trade from continuing on. "
"524010","526430"," Any normal day, that would have sold off yesterday without a doubt."
"527730","531530"," So whatever, with all that stuff set aside, let's talk about some stuff here, okay?"
"532770","535210"," So we're kind of hanging out in No Man's Land here."
"535210","538990"," And that's, that's really not the place to be buying a dip. "
"539250","540130"," Even here, here, here."
"540230","541710"," You could possibly buy a spread here."
"542150","544910"," This is No Man's Land, believe it or not, 412 down here. "
"545470","549810"," And it, it says 412.46. It needs to say just 412 flat, I think."
"550970","552930"," So we'll take a look at, we'll take a look down here."
"554230","555710"," We're going to make this 412 flat. "
"557110","558470"," We're going to get a 411 down here."
"558790","560050"," Four, four, one, one, zero."
"561330","562370"," A little bit cleaner. "
"563630","564310"," Something like that."
"564610","569230"," And we're going to go to five day chart and just show you the volatility that's expected today is"
"569230","569970"," huge."
"571090","573950"," The implied move today is huge. "
"574690","576090"," So this is noise right here."
"576190","576910"," This means nothing."
"577210","578930"," This little move down is absolutely nothing. "
"579230","580970"," I was hoping that some of you were thought about this."
"582910","587330"," What I thought about this chart that I posted today and how wide it was."
"590420","593940"," Now this R2 above here, we'll talk about this this morning. "
"594440","599680"," We probably won't reach this R2 if we do reach it until Friday."
"600420","603840"," So anything you buy today, if you're going to be very aggressive and you're like, I'm buying zero"
"603840","604460"," dates today, Cap."
"604640","606540"," I don't give a shit or yeah, zero dates day. "
"606600","607100"," I don't give a shit."
"607880","609480"," Do not buy anything."
"610400","614660"," No matter where we are today at one 30 at two o'clock to 30. "
"615280","616600"," Nothing over 420."
"618380","619760"," Nothing in zero dates."
"620560","624840"," Okay, so if you're even considering zero dates today, do not buy anything over 420. "
"625380","630380"," Now, personally, I'll probably be buying some Friday."
"631240","633200"," I probably won't be buying zero dates today."
"633600","636660"," Probably be buying some Friday 430s. "
"637140","644540"," I posted that for you on the add captains off of this morning to keep your eyes on the 430"
"644540","646300"," seas, expiring on Friday."
"646680","650500"," At the time when I posted that, it was at like 80 something cents, 89 cents or something."
"651480","653400"," And they're now down to 56 cents. "
"653580","654320"," They're half price almost."
"655160","657240"," And I give a price target of like 30 cents."
"657980","659080"," So we're not quite there. "
"660320","663360"," And I even said you could even roll into them at 60 cents."
"663500","664260"," Start adding on them."
"665520","670940"," You could buy like, you know, I don't know, a rack or so at 60 or 50 or 40 or"
"670940","671320"," 30. "
"671320","673940"," As we head down there and dollar cost average into them."
"675680","677500"," Personally, I want to pay 30 cents for them."
"678860","679720"," Somewhere in there. "
"679860","681940"," That should print like a thousand percent, by the way."
"683900","691860"," Now, with that said, if it takes us till Friday to get to 430, even those Friday calls might not,"
"692020","693460"," might start losing value on Thursday."
"693500","695140"," So you're going to have to manage those calls. "
"695660","699880"," It depends if we get the gap or if you get the trade up to 420, if we can get"
"699880","705480"," the gap up overnight in futures, if they're not, if they're not hedging so much anymore."
"705780","710940"," We've got some burn and volatility for a bid on Thursday."
"711340","715820"," I'm really looking to capture a premium kick on it on those calls. "
"716240","722520"," And then the implication, the implied move, of course, to 430 on Friday would should keep some in"
"722520","726720"," not intrinsic value, but gamma on those on those calls."
"726720","728420"," So it's going to be a tricky play."
"729120","729860"," We'll let it out. "
"730100","730900"," Keep your eyes on them."
"731280","732080"," They're going to have to be managed."
"732360","733760"," Anything you buy today is going to have to be managed. "
"735000","738880"," Another note today would be any kind of crazy moves in the market."
"739020","740840"," There's two places we're going to talk about today."
"743080","746420"," Usually in FMC days, you might see a bid before 2PM. "
"748120","749640"," So let's say, let's say this is 12."
"750500","751060"," Let's do it."
"751100","751920"," Let's do it like this. "
"752100","752280"," Okay."
"753160","754200"," We'll do it just like this."
"756870","758170"," That's 2PM right there. "
"764930","767890"," Now you might get, you might actually catch a bid before 2PM."
"768470","771010"," You might, you, we should be weak until 130."
"772370","774210"," But you know, sometimes that shit leaks. "
"775390","778150"," When I would trade this, it used to be like 1, 130."
"778570","781090"," And then like the last time, I think it was 1130 in the morning."
"782190","784290"," That shit leaked and it got bought. "
"785070","790130"," So anytime from about 1130 this morning until about 130 this afternoon, there's going to be a dip"
"790130","790450"," to buy."
"791070","798010"," Now that dip to buy, the danger in this dip to buy is, let's say we wiggle our way down"
"798010","798290"," here."
"799070","799330"," Right?"
"799610","800550"," So like 11 o'clock. "
"801170","802390"," Then there's a dip to buy."
"802770","802870"," Right?"
"804550","805730"," Let's say you buy that dip."
"805730","806030"," Right?"
"806230","808690"," And we start trading up before, believe it or not, before 2PM. "
"811220","813860"," I'm not expecting much out of that press release."
"814100","815720"," I think that press release is going to be neutral."
"816020","820620"," I think that press release is going to tell you 50 BPS QT. "
"821020","825960"," There may be some details in there that the journalists will look at and it's going to not be."
"826340","828040"," I think there's going to be some funny talk in there."
"828160","830400"," I think they know they have to support the credit markets. "
"830660","833600"," I think they know they have to support currencies and a lot of fucking nonsense."
"837490","840550"," But the press are later at 2.30. That's the one to watch."
"840770","847570"," That's the one where if you get that rip early in the day, you might get a violent sell down. "
"847570","852150"," It's a 508, 405, believe it or not, it could get that nasty."
"853930","857550"," So you might get this like kick ass trade here and then you might have a second one here."
"857970","859710"," And you might panic sell if this happens. "
"860830","865750"," I would advise against that or reposition yourself at some point."
"865970","869970"," Just be conscious of those two moves that could take place."
"869970","873030"," You get something like this, something like that and then we go up. "
"873850","877290"," If it's hawkish, we go down here, right?"
"877290","880710"," They will keep it down into the Friday expiry."
"882010","883010"," Be aware of that."
"884030","889930"," I would not be placing trades today at any time today that are nothing other than like 30 cent, 15"
"889930","890950"," cent trades. "
"891690","895710"," It wouldn't be down here if I were you with the risk that's in the market and being like, yeah,"
"895810","900590"," I'm going to buy some fucking calls that cost two, three dollars or some spreads that cost two,"
"900610","901050"," three dollars."
"901330","901730"," Fuck no."
"902390","902770"," Nope. "
"902890","904270"," No point in that putting that risk on."
"904270","909350"," Now, if you burn like a total of 30 cents or 60 cents or something like that and the market"
"909350","910950"," sells up, what do you care?"
"911810","912710"," You shouldn't care."
"913030","918030"," You shouldn't care if we get hawkish news and it sells down below 400 and only losing 60 cents. "
"918530","924070"," Your only job here is to spend as little as possible to grab the right dip."
"924370","929530"," And so if you spend as little as possible grabbing the right dip, it doesn't matter if it costs 30"
"929530","931590"," cents that that time or 60 cents."
"931590","937150"," Or even like 80 cents, if it ends up like, if it gets real deep, deep, deep down, it doesn't"
"937150","937290"," matter. "
"937430","937790"," They're going to pay."
"939450","944750"," But the key in this trade is that you're looking for moments of weakness in the market today."
"945510","948410"," And this is a moment, we're in a weak moment at this moment, but not quite. "
"949370","950610"," This is really not weak."
"951550","952430"," I want my cursors."
"952670","953390"," This is kind of weak. "
"954210","955810"," And this is kind of weak down here."
"956410","958190"," This is what I'm waiting for some down here."
"959070","960770"," To grab some cheap ass calls. "
"962350","965530"," And the other key point in this is that you don't want to grab them too early either."
"965690","970330"," If you grab like a 30 cent call right here, sometimes they'll bleed them down like 15 cents."
"970890","973050"," Seriously, like another 10 or 20 minutes. "
"973830","977130"," So we'll manage this and monitor this as the day moves forward."
"979370","984170"," Another thought about today would be why is Biden coming out at 2 o'clock, which is fucking stupid."
"984470","985990"," There's no reason for him to be out there. "
"986550","988750"," Probably have to delete this video today for swearing."
"988750","989850"," I'm almost sure."
"990110","991670"," Because my videos are being reviewed right now. "
"992230","994770"," I can't be swearing in the first like 10 minutes or 15 minutes."
"995310","996310"," And of course I did."
"998230","1001350"," So, which is kind of crazy. "
"1003530","1007170"," Now it's so crazy."
"1008070","1008150"," Whatever."
"1008790","1016050"," So the point is this is that timing is key. "
"1016310","1018730"," These are one of those moments where you have time things appropriately."
"1018730","1020590"," You know you've got Biden coming out too."
"1020830","1022550"," That should lend some volatility to the market. "
"1022750","1024589"," But in reality, it's a nothing burger."
"1025470","1032310"," The only thing you should be paying attention to in that speech from Biden is that Biden new oil is"
"1032310","1032829"," going up today."
"1033650","1036050"," If Biden brings up any time price controls. "
"1037150","1039470"," If you're an oil and gas, he brings up price controls."
"1040450","1046589"," If you're in anything that sells a product that there could be price controls on."
"1048050","1049850"," Anything crazy priced out there. "
"1050930","1052630"," You could get fucked in that trade."
"1053370","1055550"," If you're an oil gas guy and you're like fuck that, it's going up cap."
"1056170","1056690"," I'm telling you. "
"1057150","1059070"," I think it's a very small chance."
"1059250","1059830"," Like 5%."
"1059830","1062930"," Maybe 0.5%. That's 50%. "
"1062930","1070410"," Like 0.05. 0.05%. But if they bring even whisper that, you're going to see weakness probably in the"
"1070410","1072030"," stock market and probably in energy."
"1074290","1076610"," That could impact our economy."
"1076870","1079370"," Now, I don't want to scare you either because I don't think that happens. "
"1079610","1081690"," But that's your tail risk and that's it."
"1082110","1088450"," Other than that, the real key to be watching though, the real key to be watching is the numbers."
"1088830","1091990"," If 50 BPS or not, that's going to be your key to be paying attention to. "
"1092450","1096970"," Is it 50 BPS and are we getting QT and what kind of QT are we getting?"
"1097610","1099510"," Are we still talking and talking about QT?"
"1099510","1101790"," Are they talking about QT in a June?"
"1102970","1103490"," Right?"
"1103790","1105370"," Are they doing QT, QT now?"
"1106310","1108190"," Are they going to make a decision in June?"
"1109050","1110610"," Because that's talking about talking about QT."
"1110990","1111930"," That's a big one."
"1113570","1117610"," And then the last part of that conversation, that's the FOMC at 2."
"1117930","1118270"," Now 230. "
"1119870","1121470"," I want you all to be aware of that."
"1122590","1128270"," If you've noticed, Jay Powell has got more and more hawkish in his..."
"1129350","1131810"," Statement, or not the statement, but in his pressers."
"1134390","1137150"," And when he does that, it does affect the market. "
"1137890","1140650"," So that could be your second point of weakness today, right?"
"1140850","1145710"," And it's crazy because I'll sit there sometimes and I'll watch a Jay Powell presser and it starts"
"1145710","1146270"," out great."
"1147190","1150850"," And then that last reporter gets in there like 20 minutes, half hour later."
"1152170","1153930"," And you're thinking everything's great, we're going up. "
"1154450","1156150"," And boom, they drop a bomb question."
"1156150","1158590"," And he goes off in a tangent."
"1158830","1160710"," Not a tangent, but he goes off in a..."
"1160710","1161890"," I'm in charge of the economy. "
"1162150","1163870"," I'm going to raise 75 BPS next."
"1164570","1165310"," All that kind of nonsense."
"1166190","1168170"," And the market fucking craters one more time. "
"1168710","1169350"," So it's high volatility."
"1170030","1174070"," There's at least two chances today for the market to crater at some point."
"1174790","1175730"," You have to be aware of that. "
"1175870","1176910"," You can't be in there buying calls."
"1177530","1183110"," I mean like, hey cap, why don't you tell me it's going to reverse like that."
"1185330","1186770"," Another risk today. "
"1187230","1188130"," This one's real though."
"1188810","1192830"," If he comes out and he says, we're at 25 BPS."
"1194650","1195970"," We're no rate increases. "
"1196330","1197370"," We're going to just monitor."
"1198330","1202330"," Because I'll tell you what, that gas coming out today, that gas price coming out today could be"
"1202330","1202610"," him."
"1203450","1205870"," Get, believe it or not, get put now 25 BPS. "
"1206130","1211330"," Comments from President Biden just reiterating and emphasizing that the United States will always"
"1211330","1213390"," remain open to additional sanctions on Russia."
"1214490","1215770"," Tell you about those gas prices."
"1215770","1218950"," He tends to talk to G7 leaders about potential further actions. "
"1221520","1224840"," There is a slim chance that they could say it's 25 BPS."
"1225360","1228220"," We're only adding 25 on to the 50th at this point due to gas prices."
"1228740","1232080"," He could come out there today and say to you, we've got worries with Ukraine. "
"1232680","1234220"," We've got worries with gas prices."
"1235540","1236580"," Just like COVID, right?"
"1236760","1237240"," We're going to monitor."
"1238480","1239300"," See how bad it is. "
"1241560","1243580"," There is that that could happen today."
"1243680","1245660"," Now, if that happens and they don't do that, right?"
"1246440","1248320"," Let's say that they come in more dumbish than expected."
"1249120","1251180"," You could still see a quick drop down. "
"1251360","1256080"," This is a drop down where a bank wants to cut their shorts loose and take it long."
"1256940","1259420"," Even if you're like, we're going to get a great Fed meeting."
"1262140","1270140"," Now, another thing, if we get something super bearish, if we get something super bearish like 75"
"1270140","1273840"," BPS or **** you T, we're going full tilt. "
"1274020","1276580"," We're going to murder all these, uh, murder the equities market."
"1277080","1279240"," Sometimes instead of seeing a drop like this, right?"
"1280040","1280780"," Drop down."
"1283750","1286230"," Believe it or not, you'll end up seeing a spike higher. "
"1287510","1292210"," So if you see, if we, if we see something hawkish in the statement and the press, and the press"
"1292210","1294830"," release or in the presser, it is possible."
"1295430","1298510"," You could see a swing high, believe it or not."
"1298510","1300110"," You could see a little bit more shorts to pile in and even better prices. "
"1300910","1308950"," So be careful with what your interpretation is as to flash crashes or quick spikes up, like fast."
"1309250","1310190"," They happen so fast."
"1310910","1315470"," It's like a minute or two, three minutes, four minutes, five minutes max, and you'll see a quick"
"1315470","1317530"," spike up and then we'll start selling it. "
"1317650","1318950"," You see something like this right off."
"1319750","1322010"," It has a potential to go real deep down here."
"1322230","1322270"," Okay. "
"1324830","1326350"," That's a lot to a lot of information, right?"
"1326550","1327910"," A lot of stuff to be thinking about."
"1327910","1333730"," Like a, I don't know, like a basketball player or a, you know, anything you need, a soccer player,"
"1333730","1335530"," like you need to be quick in your feet today."
"1336090","1342690"," If this is too much for you today to be thinking about, then maybe it's just some call spreads down"
"1342690","1342910"," here. "
"1343450","1345150"," Does that make sense for you?"
"1345310","1350750"," Like for about 15 minutes now, the European cash close and we're seeing some global equity weakness"
"1350750","1352390"," here heading into the European close."
"1353070","1355290"," The DAX is now down a third over percent."
"1355290","1357430"," The cat cron is down more than one percent. "
"1357650","1360010"," U.S. equity markets are at the lows of the session."
"1360450","1364210"," 41, 47 in the S&P minis down half a percent."
"1364770","1365110"," Hey, buddy. "
"1365230","1370390"," The NASDAQ 100 futures are down about one and a half percent at 12,096."
"1372270","1374110"," The VIXET 29, 29."
"1374770","1376350"," It all changed on the day. "
"1378740","1381000"," So the whole point being is that you can just come down here with a cap."
"1381140","1381900"," I don't want to play that game."
"1382060","1382120"," Tap. "
"1382260","1383160"," I don't want to deal with that bullshit."
"1383480","1384380"," This makes sense, right?"
"1384540","1385320"," You just come down here."
"1385320","1388080"," If you have a dip, you close your computer and you wait. "
"1389180","1389520"," Right?"
"1389900","1392760"," Literally, you should show your computer down because they're going to tell you all kinds of"
"1392760","1393720"," nastiness."
"1395400","1401800"," Euro trading at 105.52 is up 33 pips on the day holding near the highs of the day in"
"1401800","1402140"," the Euro."
"1403080","1407240"," You're more than likely, even with bad news, snap back and come back down the road, okay?"
"1408080","1409680"," So you could put a month on those. "
"1410180","1412740"," I'm going to talk about why you put a month on them and not Friday."
"1412740","1416640"," We'll talk about the OPEX for this month for May, right?"
"1416840","1417640"," I think it's May 20th."
"1417740","1419720"," I'll confirm that, but I think it's May 20th. "
"1420300","1425400"," But that OPEX has a ton of puts rolling off the board, okay?"
"1425440","1426240"," May 20th."
"1426920","1430700"," So if we have puts rolling off the board on May 20th, I think I called somebody earlier and said,"
"1430860","1434400"," get May 20th spreads, make them a week later or the day after."
"1437200","1438820"," We've got maybe a week after. "
"1439100","1441300"," One week after the 20th, you would get some call spreads."
"1441300","1448320"," Because that would give you the last tick on a bad FOMC to get back above 4,000 into the"
"1448320","1449500"," 420, 430 range."
"1450120","1453300"," You'd have that on your side heading into the week after OPEX. "
"1454420","1458340"," So key that in for, break that down in paper, all right?"
"1459800","1460940"," We'll look at that for a month out."
"1462280","1464420"," We'll talk about it in more detail here in a minute."
"1465920","1466960"," On a negative. "
"1467320","1470740"," We have a bad hawkish statement."
"1473760","1475380"," There's the 20th right there, right?"
"1478160","1480800"," Let's say you buy them at 405 or 410, right?"
"1481020","1482920"," And you're like, oh, cap, I'm totally fucked down here."
"1483280","1485960"," And you're watching all the dassels on Twitter or whatever. "
"1487020","1489280"," And they tell you it's going to burn, right?"
"1489480","1491560"," It's going to come swooping back up here and you're going to get this."
"1491680","1492440"," You're going to get this tick."
"1492600","1494360"," I don't think it's going to be like this. "
"1495420","1496460"," Or something like that."
"1496720","1500120"," I think that's what it's going to be, but at least something like this."
"1500720","1501840"," And then slam down. "
"1502420","1504800"," That would be a, with a, with a, with a, with a, with a hawkish fed."
"1505060","1506480"," And then you're going to get a slam up over here."
"1508020","1510960"," So if you get some, some call spreads in here, it's going to look ugly. "
"1511580","1513740"," And then it's going to come back and actually print you no matter what."
"1513980","1515900"," So that's some safety, that's a safety trade for you."
"1515960","1518320"," If you don't want to deal with any of this bullshit today. "
"1518640","1520240"," Here's my price target from May 4th."
"1520760","1521760"," I don't think we're getting in."
"1521800","1522780"," I don't think we're getting in. "
"1524620","1526640"," I'm off on this trade so far."
"1529430","1530630"," So that's my point."
"1530630","1530870"," Okay. "
"1530970","1531770"," So you can just take it easy."
"1531890","1535350"," You don't have to deal with the violent moves in here."
"1535490","1538270"," Now if you do choose, if you're like, fuck that cap, I'm, I'm in. "
"1539850","1541070"," If you're in, right?"
"1541570","1543710"," My recommendation is that you diamond hand."
"1543710","1546750"," And if you lose that trade, you diamond hand it."
"1547130","1547830"," You just burn it. "
"1548830","1550570"," Because there's always that chance, right?"
"1550570","1555730"," In this volatility down here that you're going to see some nastiness that could go like this."
"1556370","1559750"," And you'll come back on like a day or two with a Friday call Friday outside of my calls."
"1559750","1564790"," You'll be like, fuck cap, they went from 30 cents down a two cents and then back up to 30"
"1564790","1565130"," cents. "
"1565550","1566730"," I could have at least broke even."
"1567110","1568110"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"1568990","1572210"," Or they could have, they went up down a two cents note to 15 cents and I could have at"
"1572210","1573410"," least saved half my money."
"1573970","1580090"," Or I could have rolled into more or I could have reset or, you know, I saved those, captured the"
"1580090","1583310"," 15 cents on them and then actually repositioned for a better trade higher. "
"1583950","1586790"," So make sure you're, you're, you're managing your trades today."
"1586910","1588450"," Okay, it's very important that you manage trades."
"1588970","1592450"," Very important that you decide on what kind of headaches you want the next few days. "
"1593530","1595470"," And that you don't get too beaten up in the head."
"1595710","1597630"," Like, so if we, if we sell off, we have a hawker statement."
"1597870","1601090"," We burn the whole market down to, I don't know, 390 or something stupid like that. "
"1601570","1602510"," Stay in the game."
"1604150","1605090"," Stay in the game."
"1605090","1609830"," Because that, that 390 might have been a place for you to buy and save that bad trade that you"
"1609830","1610210"," had above. "
"1611210","1616030"," So a big part of trading, right, is if you're losing a trade that you were able to save that"
"1616030","1616190"," trade."
"1616370","1623030"," Oftentimes, there's a, at least a year where I traded where I would cut something loose only to"
"1623030","1623730"," have it come back."
"1624510","1630870"," Or I'd cut something loose and my, my, my mentality was a fucking markets burn. "
"1630870","1632150"," I'm totally pissed off here."
"1632150","1635370"," I'm too, I'm too scared to take, to take, take this next bottom."
"1635850","1640470"," And if I had just taken that next bottom, I would have printed stupid multiples of money. "
"1640750","1642490"," So, so be tough today."
"1643010","1645810"," If you're trading this market, you have to be tough trading this market today."
"1646970","1651610"," If you can't be tough trading this market today, you're just placing a spread, closing your shit"
"1651610","1651770"," up. "
"1651950","1652550"," Don't listen to me."
"1653130","1654330"," Just don't listen to Twitter."
"1654670","1657450"," Don't listen to the stank tweets, whatever you, walls, free pets. "
"1657770","1658450"," Just stay off the internet."
"1659210","1660110"," Don't read Bloomberg."
"1661190","1662110"," Don't read Forbes. "
"1663130","1663970"," Staff the internet."
"1664690","1665370"," Make your trade."
"1665710","1666210"," Get in your bunker. "
"1666610","1667790"," Go away till Prince."
"1672430","1672810"," All right."
"1672950","1674230"," So we're going to go over some more of the things this morning. "
"1675650","1676450"," We're going to go over."
"1676530","1677230"," What are we going to go over here?"
"1680920","1682580"," So today's note is from the founder."
"1683240","1683760"," We got it. "
"1683980","1686300"," We actually have the founders note today from spot gamma."
"1686640","1688320"," So we'll, we'll do what they're talking about here."
"1689920","1692360"," Sustained rally is unlikely to occur until five four. "
"1692580","1693380"," We know that now, right?"
"1694740","1697160"," Substantial, longer term support at 40 50."
"1699840","1701760"," Accepting lower prices in the market, right?"
"1701980","1702700"," That's that key is right."
"1702840","1704660"," Futures acquired overnight and absolutely to 4185. "
"1705180","1709220"," We expect to come session today up until two p.m. FMC events following that."
"1709320","1711800"," We see key resistance following that."
"1712720","1714180"," We see key resistance. "
"1715540","1716680"," At four twenty."
"1718420","1718940"," Right?"
"1720280","1724380"," With four twenty eight as the next resistance point from our models."
"1727750","1729850"," So following following FMC. "
"1730650","1732170"," We'll probably only get this today."
"1732330","1732770"," Four twenty."
"1732990","1735610"," So if you're going to buy zero dates, that's your fucking price target. "
"1736430","1739850"," Only thing you need to worry about is where you're buying them."
"1740190","1744030"," You buy them at four fourteen or you buy them at four ten or you buy them at four or"
"1744030","1744310"," five."
"1745230","1746510"," It's a key in on that. "
"1746630","1746790"," Okay."
"1747650","1748590"," Very important."
"1751680","1754800"," Support shows at forty one twenty five and forty one ten. "
"1755020","1756340"," So basically spy four ten."
"1756860","1761360"," As we've noted for some time now, we're looking for a strong directional move out of the FMC"
"1761360","1761860"," statement."
"1761980","1765780"," Yesterday we discussed that the market direction likely leads to a reduction in event volatility. "
"1766200","1768040"," Assuming Powell doesn't come off as overly hawkish."
"1769040","1770360"," This is about the."
"1771180","1773720"," This is about when he starts talking right at two thirty. "
"1774560","1774860"," I don't know."
"1774860","1774960"," Yes."
"1775120","1775680"," We also aligned. "
"1775840","1779280"," There's not a large options exploration around FMC."
"1780080","1784540"," You measure less than fifteen percent of total S&P gamma expiring this week."
"1785100","1787200"," Now total would be today and Friday. "
"1793230","1795310"," Normally we get twenty percent in a day."
"1796490","1797870"," To tell about two days."
"1799610","1801090"," Less than twenty percent. "
"1802870","1804430"," Between today's expiring Friday."
"1804670","1805570"," So I didn't read that part yet."
"1806750","1812090"," This small exploration reduces the put burn and in turn may reduce the velocity of a rally. "
"1813530","1815350"," Or spreads come in right."
"1816010","1817390"," Even spreads for Friday come in here."
"1817710","1823070"," If we're down at four ten let's say and you've got a four ten four fifteen wide spread for Friday. "
"1823850","1824830"," Probably going to print for you."
"1825810","1830850"," But you're going to need to worry about the sideways the downs and the fucker fucker round that's"
"1830850","1832370"," going to take place between now and Friday."
"1833270","1836510"," In yesterday's post we highlighted 440 as a big resistance point. "
"1837190","1840230"," Due to the valve trigger appearing at that strike this is another key one."
"1840790","1842330"," This is what I had some problems with this morning."
"1842330","1846050"," I had to go in and start looking down the road like a month down the road six months down"
"1846050","1846290"," the road. "
"1846410","1846750"," That kind of shit."
"1848070","1850810"," The valve trigger has today dropped lower to 430."
"1851250","1851670"," That's bad. "
"1853490","1855710"," Which is also another large open interest point."
"1855710","1862210"," For this reason we are marking down our key post FMC rally resistance line from 440 to 430."
"1863490","1864190"," That's big. "
"1864710","1865170"," That's huge."
"1866510","1866790"," No 440s."
"1867530","1870270"," No upper bounds of 450s if more calls go in the market. "
"1870870","1870990"," 430."
"1872170","1872730"," Much lower."
"1874390","1877450"," We think that this level would be possibly in play for tomorrow or Friday. "
"1878810","1880690"," So that gives you your time frame right."
"1881170","1882810"," 430 between tomorrow and Friday."
"1886220","1888000"," I'll leave this up you can come back and look at this. "
"1889540","1894460"," Further our OPEX tables show that large propositions don't start to roll up until May OPEX 520."
"1896140","1901060"," With a more significant expiration on June 17th quarterly OPEX."
"1902120","1905980"," So you're starting to have to think about May and June believe it or not. "
"1906360","1909320"," So you're going to get a bump post OPEX in May."
"1911120","1914580"," And then the June 17th after June 17th."
"1914580","1916500"," Other than that the markets going down. "
"1917040","1920720"," Not a lot of places for bulls to be hiding in May and June."
"1922020","1926720"," So when we're down here at these levels we'll look at a larger chart over a larger time period."
"1929680","1932120"," We're going to look at a larger time period here right. "
"1933000","1934520"," What they're saying to you."
"1944020","1945480"," Here's June in here right."
"1946520","1952000"," The saying to you is that the markets more probably going to go down or it can go up here. "
"1952000","1957440"," But then down and then up into June and then continue down."
"1957940","1962120"," More than likely inside of this channel."
"1962340","1964660"," This channel has a possibility of continuing. "
"1965500","1967780"," So you come down come back up and come down."
"1968080","1971780"," Start on your own draw your chart out here and start to figure in."
"1972280","1973840"," Hey where are these bottoms going to be. "
"1974320","1979020"," So they can buy and where are these rips going to get sold above as time goes on."
"1980320","1981620"," Now we're at one right now."
"1982440","1985500"," So I'm not I'm not I'm not that concerned right now believe it or not. "
"1985580","1988720"," But start to consider that there's going to be there implying that there's not going to be a break"
"1988720","1990260"," above here to 450."
"1991560","1994600"," It's going to be subdued at least until June."
"1995420","1996660"," That's a big that's a big change. "
"1997180","1998780"," A big change in outlook."
"2003260","2007520"," As many of you know we flag large expirations as key market turning points due to the fact that"
"2007520","2009260"," trigger changes in dealer flows right."
"2009260","2014620"," So after May 20th after June 17 assuming Powell does not spark fairs in the market. "
"2014760","2018820"," We are looking for relief rally and markets which will function to provide some breathing room to"
"2018820","2021640"," the downside versus current position of max put."
"2021840","2025940"," Ultimately if the market fails to recover the vault trigger currently 430."
"2027660","2034260"," Level then we'd view any rally is simply short covering with the high likelihood of reversing i.e."
"2034280","2037420"," If we don't make five 430 by like Friday or Monday right. "
"2038420","2039920"," They're going to get real nasty."
"2041700","2046680"," If Powell does drive stocks low we look for a rather quick test of four thousand forty fifty this"
"2046680","2048800"," would push S&P into large four thousand sport."
"2049320","2055000"," In full floor bound with that we set up we anticipate large violent swings akin to late February"
"2055000","2058960"," early March with May 20th OPEC's a turning point. "
"2059880","2064739"," So she could get nasty at four thousand right you'll see a bounce off four thousand up down up down"
"2064739","2065219"," up down."
"2065880","2070840"," One day literally you're just trading you're trading literally a bounce and then literally a top."
"2071159","2074620"," You'd sell a top as fast as you can you wouldn't hold it overnight and you'd be right back down"
"2074620","2075020"," in the morning. "
"2075719","2079500"," Right back up in the afternoon to be getting real violent at four thousand you're not going to"
"2079500","2080739"," break four thousand like that."
"2081159","2086400"," Because I mean no like violent moves we break four thousand start just careening down to 380 360"
"2086400","2088540"," unless you triggered panic in the market."
"2088900","2091100"," And even if you did probably gonna take some time. "
"2091699","2094100"," This is the violent hawkish move down below here."
"2097670","2099210"," So this isn't good for the market right."
"2099350","2103450"," You have to start thinking about are we going to stay down here you're also going to be thinking"
"2103450","2107450"," about that four thirty is going to be a big number for the market. "
"2108050","2109330"," Huge number for the market."
"2110050","2111770"," It's like a full court press from the Bears."
"2112310","2118590"," The scary part about that is it's going to imply that the Bears or the bar banks or the Bears"
"2118590","2125720"," are going to try to force some kind of acceptance down here at four thousand. "
"2125720","2131760"," Which does to an extent make sense it makes that it makes that idea that."
"2132280","2135120"," If we're going to if we're going to sacrifice the equities market."
"2137410","2138370"," Holy shit. "
"2138910","2142570"," If we're going to sacrifice the equities market means that they're going to tell you."
"2143090","2145110"," This is your new training range down here."
"2147610","2150290"," And we're going to pound you down here as time goes on. "
"2150290","2155630"," And eventually in June or July and June or July may force you to accept."
"2156390","2163740"," Let's say three eighty doesn't even can't trade up here and make money but it does mean that"
"2163740","2166640"," they're implying that over time between now and June."
"2167120","2168280"," In July that. "
"2169240","2173160"," And especially the dog days of summer that they're going to have you start accepting not four"
"2173160","2174540"," thousand but like three eighty."
"2175800","2179200"," There'll be a slow bleed out of the market if we if they could do the soft landing quote unquote."
"2180040","2183140"," I would put us at like three sixty in the fall. "
"2186400","2186880"," That's big."
"2188000","2190340"," If you're an investor if you're a bull investor."
"2191340","2193020"," Just considering that. "
"2196160","2199200"," Considering that is going to be a hard pill."
"2200200","2204620"," The four thousand level of trust in this market even for hedge funds."
"2205400","2206700"," Not hedge funds but. "
"2208740","2210780"," The four will have a little bit."
"2213300","2216780"," Large position holders in the spy right large."
"2217000","2221680"," You got Warren Buffett saying he's buying apple right now like this is going to make them scratch"
"2221680","2222760"," and consider their heads. "
"2225140","2226320"," Consider in their heads."
"2226780","2229300"," Hey do I want to hold here at three eighty or three sixty."
"2230120","2233860"," Or as my time horizon longer I'm buying between four thousand three sixty. "
"2235060","2239480"," So this is a big this is big for a for a for a long term investor to have a"
"2239480","2240480"," pill to swallow."
"2241260","2245940"," And there's an implication that some market participants are going to try to force that you know"
"2245940","2248320"," four speed that into the summer months."
"2251060","2254880"," Okay that doesn't mean there's dips to buy in here doesn't mean you're not going to really get in"
"2254880","2255760"," here and. "
"2256120","2260400"," And have some dips to buy doesn't mean you're not going to have some test tops to sell if you're"
"2260400","2260660"," a bear."
"2261360","2262640"," But just be conscious of that now."
"2263200","2264220"," With all that said. "
"2267160","2271640"," If we get down and we bring above that four thirty right all bets are off with that bear straight."
"2273440","2275080"," And you have to be open to that."
"2277220","2281160"," Even with this even with this bearish outlook of two three months down the road. "
"2282660","2285520"," Keep going through the cash equity close in Europe."
"2286260","2287640"," Keep a part of your mind."
"2289260","2291560"," Two and a half hours now to the FOMC announcement. "
"2293040","2294120"," On this."
"2295240","2298940"," On this trade higher on this bull tail risk trade higher."
"2300140","2306240"," Because they could be locking in all these bears right and sure enough right the bears like fuck it"
"2306240","2308400"," we know we're going down we're going out of three sixty. "
"2308860","2310000"," I'm full tilt in."
"2311240","2312860"," And eight they just reverse it."
"2313620","2317440"," That has happened many times in previous bear markets. "
"2319100","2322700"," Many times where believe it or not the top is not in."
"2325020","2327600"," And this will blow a bears a bears asshole out."
"2327900","2329180"," Shit you're not in. "
"2330260","2335460"," By the time retail catches up to it retail bulls catch up to it it'll be the top and they'll"
"2335460","2336040"," think that the."
"2336780","2338080"," At the bear market is over."
"2339640","2343820"," So you're killing two retail traders with one stone. "
"2345340","2346660"," You're killing bears off."
"2348260","2351880"," Lower up a bears account believe it or not because the psychology of it."
"2352500","2358820"," And then the time of bull enters and says you know bear market over. "
"2359540","2364500"," And they're just full port and fucking Tesla four sixty four eighty or something."
"2365320","2369260"," Or five hundred or they're full port and millions and millions of dollars right."
"2369940","2374260"," The time they actually believe it they're in there they they actually sell it down violently. "
"2375920","2378500"," So just have this in the back of your mind at all times."
"2379700","2383500"," Have that little tail right that little bull tail risk in the back in the back of your mind that"
"2383500","2384860"," that could be potential."
"2385580","2388320"," And four thirty right now is the level that you're looking for four thirty. "
"2389460","2394740"," Up here is is that is that turn around currently that number will change of course as we trade."
"2394740","2402120"," In time the vol trigger will come down here for four twelve four ten four five four hundred."
"2402820","2405220"," To keep that on your palate as we move forward. "
"2408640","2409620"," Don't ever commit."
"2411500","2415860"," Right be a price action trader be a price action investor especially the bull."
"2416600","2419820"," And as a bear you just have to have that in the back of your mind you can have your"
"2419820","2423820"," conviction you know you can be like hey cap fuck you this market's going down for the next year to. "
"2424360","2427180"," Fuck you cap we're gonna have a market crash that's fine."
"2428000","2434600"," But in the back of your mind at least leave the room the capacity to change your viewpoint."
"2435080","2440980"," And even if we do go up if you're a bull you have to know that it's still coming no"
"2440980","2441460"," matter what. "
"2443080","2445800"," The bear market's gonna still be here even if we trade iron."
"2447060","2451900"," It's there it's just it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it takes a year three years for a market"
"2451900","2452800"," crash in two weeks."
"2453280","2455840"," It's not going it's not going away at this point. "
"2456400","2461260"," There's nothing with short term debt nothing with inflation nothing with shortages nothing with war"
"2461260","2462840"," on the horizon even to war solve."
"2463240","2467080"," That says that even with even with all we have all kinds of other issues."
"2467520","2470860"," The few futures on some commodities demand is going to go down. "
"2471160","2472280"," You've got to raise the chair."
"2472400","2475320"," Yellen saying she feels quite good about the strength of the US economy."
"2476140","2482720"," Nasty debt out there you've got zombie companies out there 50% of companies are zombie companies. "
"2483100","2486080"," Nothing that they're gonna they're gonna spew to go high."
"2486560","2489260"," Nothing they're gonna spew to you is gonna is gonna be valid."
"2490060","2495740"," It's just this last rip higher which happens all the time I can show you examples of it. "
"2501520","2506100"," It's like a six month one year relentless up move."
"2507860","2509360"," You're not gonna want to believe it."
"2509700","2514480"," So just be because someone commented this morning said I'm a I'm an old school bear. "
"2514640","2515900"," I know that that can happen."
"2516900","2519600"," We noted the negative first quarter GDP."
"2520520","2528280"," Reading was not good bear got a lying sign for the economy bears had it happened to him once before"
"2528280","2529180"," polls didn't. "
"2530080","2532840"," So polls encounter that they're not gonna believe it either."
"2533080","2537600"," Just be conscious of that if you're a new trader if you're only been an investor for I don't know"
"2537600","2539980"," fucking five years or less or something like that."
"2541000","2542700"," You might not be prepared for it. "
"2542700","2542900"," Okay."
"2545180","2549100"," So I want you to I want you to think about that as we trade this market down the road"
"2549100","2554020"," so so the idea is muted and spread out."
"2555600","2556780"," Rips at this point. "
"2558040","2564400"," And expectations of the length of the night they're not even rips really just the market melting up"
"2564400","2566020"," over days or weeks."
"2567440","2568860"," And then looking for places to sell."
"2570080","2574440"," If you're a bear your next cell is 430 right around that's what you're looking for like a major"
"2574440","2576680"," position to short the market right around 430. "
"2580970","2586050"," Just absorb all that over over over saying that consumer spending and business investment does"
"2586050","2589110"," remain strong in America is outperforming other countries."
"2591730","2596010"," The implication is you know it's it's reaching through the entire summer."
"2600830","2604590"," I wouldn't panic so if I was a bull here I'd be panics on above at 430. "
"2607930","2612290"," If we don't break 430 and hold it that's where you start cutting shit loose of your bull."
"2612690","2614890"," We're down here panics on four four thousand."
"2615510","2619150"," Wait for it to come back up at least if you're like a bull like I have been buying Apple"
"2619150","2620130"," for the past five years. "
"2621350","2622250"," Some kind of nonsense."
"2622570","2627350"," You know when repeating that inflation is too high and the global economy has risks."
"2628930","2631590"," You're going to hear a negative news all day long today. "
"2633130","2642000"," You hear doom and gloom into this FOMC it's now 1136 in the morning still having placed the trade."
"2643000","2647160"," Told you that 11 between 1130 and 130 right around there right."
"2647920","2649600"," Should see a dip to buy down here. "

"2662960","2664660"," Not a place to be buying a dip right."
"2665120","2666440"," It's kind of floating out here. "
"2667460","2670340"," Break above trading down trading down."

"2677980","2680200"," We've got 412 waiting for a tap. "
"2681900","2684460"," Not much going on today in the market right."
"2686810","2689950"," Some dip buyers here not many though you might get a spike here."
"2690490","2694430"," You don't think slow growth in Europe could spill over. "
"2697810","2702570"," Still only have 68,000 bids down here not not really that many right."
"2702810","2703770"," Not that much at 412."
"2709050","2711730"," Not many at even 410 just no bid in the market. "
"2719250","2720510"," So what do you do in FOMC today?"
"2720630","2722370"," You wait should have waited yesterday."
"2722450","2724230"," We talked about that posted that on Twitter."
"2724430","2725130"," I was like I don't even want to. "
"2725530","2726410"," I don't even want to trade today."
"2726450","2728050"," I don't want to be on Twitter."
"2728330","2729890"," I want to hang out on Twitter today. "
"2729950","2730910"," I don't want to be on live stream."
"2731550","2731870"," No point."
"2733230","2734730"," Same thing with this morning. "
"2734730","2738070"," You have no business in here buying this market this morning."
"2743470","2744270"," You just kind of chill."
"2745170","2746890"," Kind of just wait and see what happens. "
"2748630","2749450"," As we come in."
"2749890","2750830"," As we trade down."
"2750990","2751730"," We're going to look for 412. "
"2753690","2754890"," See if that's a good spot."
"2762750","2764450"," We're also going to tag one more down here."
"2764690","2768230"," We're going to make this kind of like a buy the fucking dip moment down here. "

"2780760","2782080"," That stops are down here."
"2784110","2785730"," This is where stops are down here. "
"2795210","2796450"," You'd day trade this right here."
"2796570","2797690"," But why bother?"
"2798410","2799010"," There's no point."
"2808960","2810440"," I'm going to take a quick moment here. "
"2810620","2811980"," I'm going to take a quick moment here."
"2813120","2814000"," And then talk to some."
"2814240","2816520"," If you're in here and you're a regular viewer. "
"2817440","2819180"," I did refund some people."
"2819180","2822680"," I'm going to say who those people are real quick without a."
"2823760","2824280"," Hold on here."
"2827560","2831120"," I'm saying inflation is not deeply ingrained in the US economy. "
"2831740","2836840"," The price for rises have not influenced medium term expectations."
"2837640","2839060"," It doesn't say that it's weird."
"2839220","2839240"," Yes. "
"2839440","2845400"," The situation is different than what Volker faced during his term at the Fed."
"2848630","2850050"," Paypal is all fucked up again today."
"2850330","2850750"," Or at least the. "
"2851570","2853650"," Let's see if I can scroll through here and see if I see any."
"2863260","2863740"," All right."
"2863820","2864380"," We'll pass on that. "
"2864460","2865520"," I guess I guess that didn't happen."
"2865880","2867260"," So PayPal can't just a quick story."
"2867380","2869240"," PayPal came in and they were like, whoa, buddy. "
"2869500","2870040"," We're flagging you."
"2871320","2875000"," And so I had to talk to actually got to talk to somebody alive human."
"2875960","2877480"," And I had like a court case. "
"2879280","2880380"," And I won the court case."
"2881160","2882540"," So my PayPal is back up and running."
"2885980","2886580"," So I'm safe. "
"2889430","2890350"," It's like in PayPal."
"2892830","2893310"," Okay."
"2894270","2895210"," So let's go up here. "

"2905630","2907350"," Charlie Charles, 403, 465."
"2908130","2909210"," Biden is speaking right now. "
"2910210","2910890"," Biden is yapping."
"2911210","2911610"," Is he really?"
"2913670","2914130"," Biden's talking."
"2914830","2916530"," Yeah, I don't care about him talking at all. "
"2916530","2917330"," There's nothing."
"2917750","2919570"," I don't care less."
"2923460","2927320"," Elmero, San Spice sits on the 1.68 level for March, February, March, 2025. "
"2928300","2930840"," Next level down is 3.42, which is the February, 2020 high."
"2931320","2931960"," It's going to be a breakout."
"2932280","2932540"," Best, best. "
"2932760","2934020"," Best ban on the monthly."
"2934340","2935840"," Yeah, I haven't even looked on the idea."
"2936180","2940020"," I need to show a monthly chart with the larger, that larger time frame. "
"2943040","2943840"," See what's going on here."
"2943920","2944700"," Biden is speaking now."
"2945160","2945580"," Biden is live. "
"2947380","2948340"," Biden is already live."
"2948340","2950100"," I have to change it to 11 Eastern time."
"2951020","2952560"," Is he saying anything about price controls?"
"2954820","2955740"," Fuck, no more swearing. "
"2956960","2958800"," Supposedly, there's a rule that says I can't swear."
"2959120","2961180"," I can swear after like the first five minutes or something."
"2963180","2964680"," Biden is speaking right now, not too. "
"2965280","2966500"," That's good that he's speaking now."
"2972680","2980090"," I don't like the fact of him speaking at 2 p.m. He didn't mention price controls, right?"
"2986030","2987970"," What I think about Jamie Diamond, what he's saying."
"2988190","2990290"," He's long this market without a doubt. "
"2995570","2998090"," Could get to 400 by end of day, not impossible."
"2998470","3001830"," No, it's not impossible to get to a cap's all bear porn today."
"3003870","3006890"," It's like Amazon for 12 for 10 support level due to high. "
"3009010","3011190"," Yeah, vault triggers down to 430."
"3017810","3019090"," What else do you guys say in here?"
"3019090","3022210"," If you ever goes down with 30 minute kind of buy the whole company."
"3026330","3027470"," More from treasure sector. "
"3027670","3032490"," Yellen saying the desire was to avoid the kind of scarring that followed the global financial"
"3032490","3033350"," crisis."
"3039640","3040980"," Trying to steal three of all comments."
"3043380","3046940"," Obie says I'm a bear and love you cap because you're 100% with all sides. "
"3047580","3052400"," Saying that she believes inflation is being slightly driven by historically tight labor."
"3054460","3058080"," So when he's saying we'll be at 5100 on SPX at some point before 2023."
"3058300","3058800"," I agree with that. "
"3058940","3059980"," I think it depends on where we go, right?"
"3060240","3062080"," I think there's, but I think that's on the table."
"3066120","3068020"," Can I bump my my mic voice up?"
"3068200","3069760"," Yeah, let me take a look at my mic voice real quick."
"3072440","3073220"," Check one, two. "
"3074300","3075240"," That says that it's loud here."
"3080660","3082120"," I'm missing something here."
"3090600","3094060"," There's different change of strategy for the market price indicator trade strikes. "
"3094060","3095640"," You will talk about that later this afternoon."
"3097640","3099160"," To buy the news volume is loud."
"3099500","3099580"," Okay. "
"3100260","3101120"," I'll turn that down."
"3106330","3106910"," Trade the news."
"3107110","3107610"," I'll turn that down. "
"3109970","3111310"," It's fine because we're making a falling wedge."
"3111470","3112130"," Lunchtime, any rally."
"3112650","3114730"," Captain, can you let us know when to buy?"
"3115550","3116470"," I'll let you know when I buy. "
"3117350","3118670"," I don't ever tell you guys when to buy."
"3118770","3119390"," I just tell you when I buy."
"3120590","3122890"," Can you give or take on the S?"
"3123130","3126090"," This 50 server trace from Coma Loz seems like we're heading toward that level of thought. "
"3126730","3130010"," Yeah, like the I think the whole like 34 to 3600."
"3130230","3132130"," I think that I think there's a large area there."
"3132650","3137350"," I wouldn't ever stop going to go that low or even just the bounce off like 38. "
"3138950","3144510"," There's a lot of dynamics in the market that no one out there can tell you, yes, we're going here"
"3144510","3148190"," first or they're going there first for the rate at which we go somewhere."
"3148970","3149930"," There's a real concern."
"3151150","3153550"," The soft landing thing I believe in. "
"3155250","3156330"," That they're going to attempt."
"3157490","3163950"," I agree that if there's a violent move below 4000, you could trigger violent selling in the market."
"3164330","3165690"," So I don't think they want to do that. "
"3165750","3167310"," I don't even think banks want to do that."
"3167390","3168790"," I don't think anybody wants to do that."
"3170510","3171250"," Yeah, Tesla. "
"3172750","3175050"," All of that applies to Tesla that I went through."
"3176190","3178070"," Everything that I spoke about with Tesla."
"3179010","3181170"," It applies to what I already just told you everything. "
"3183250","3185590"," Tesla is moving with the market at this point."
"3186110","3187610"," Know that for a fact, okay?"
"3188670","3194550"," No matter what you think that will move with the market with that first rant that I went on for"
"3194550","3197050"," 45 minutes or so."
"3199910","3201190"," See you guys are saying here. "
"3202210","3203610"," Yeah, PayPal does stink."
"3205710","3206310"," It's over."
"3206470","3207250"," Biden doesn't talk. "
"3207470","3208450"," He just mumbles random words."
"3209270","3210230"," Was he actually coherent?"
"3210990","3212470"," They didn't talk about price controls, right?"
"3222610","3223230"," Hey, Cap."
"3223410","3224530"," Why is volume trigger being lower?"
"3224890","3225890"," Lored bad. "
"3226570","3227470"," That's a good question."
"3227570","3230710"," It's not a question for today, but as the market moves lower."
"3232990","3235430"," They're forcing you now to accept lower prices. "
"3236050","3237990"," I can get into it later, but that's a good question."
"3238090","3239070"," Ask me that on a slow day."
"3245670","3246230"," Yeah, no. "
"3247370","3248030"," Cheatin's asking."
"3248930","3249650"," Cheatin's asking."
"3249970","3250970"," Cap regardless of how we're down. "
"3251090","3253510"," Try as long as we have these lows, dips and high rips."
"3253710","3254270"," There's money made."
"3254470","3254750"," Am I wrong?"
"3255210","3255770"," No, you do. "
"3256410","3257070"," I'm a bull."
"3257330","3257870"," I'll be honest with you."
"3257950","3258410"," I hate selling. "
"3259990","3260830"," I will sell."
"3261030","3263250"," If we get it way up there, I'll sell with a put spread."
"3264130","3267170"," But right now I still love buying dips. "
"3268630","3270310"," We'll make this really short."
"3274180","3276020"," I can't find the article right now."
"3276300","3279920"," You can find them, though, on the internet, but you should look up the history of the put. "
"3282080","3284620"," But protective puts are only meant for protection."
"3285660","3286340"," They're one to one."
"3286460","3287700"," They pay one to one, basically. "
"3288320","3291500"," They're not meant to be to buy some puts and hold them."
"3292240","3292980"," They're just not."
"3293280","3294240"," They're not built for that. "
"3294480","3294840"," Calls are."
"3295200","3296960"," And we didn't even have puts in the market at one time."
"3297720","3299100"," They're very much like the VIX. "
"3300800","3302520"," So personally, I don't like buying puts."
"3302680","3306500"," I don't like to pay off the risk, the time in the puts, the timing of puts."
"3307160","3308560"," So I like to buy dips. "
"3308700","3310440"," Even if the market goes down, I'd like to buy dips."
"3312500","3314200"," Nice little rip off the spy real quick."
"3314320","3316700"," Nice little short covering taking place in the spy. "
"3319800","3322620"," You can go back in history and know that there are great dips to buy."
"3322820","3325920"," You can know in a bear market that you'll have 10% rips, space ripping rallies."
"3325920","3331920"," So yes, I agree with, I agree that I still think that the whole way down, you can buy some"
"3331920","3342380"," kick ass kick ass rips all the way down as well. "
"3349780","3351460"," You can always go back and hear the rants."
"3351560","3352300"," If you should."
"3354160","3355240"," Hell yeah, Kevin gang. "
"3355800","3360360"," If you're just joining us, you should go back to the beginning of this program and listen to it"
"3360360","3362260"," because it is critical information for the market."
"3366180","3367020"," Nice little bounce."
"3367260","3367880"," That looks like they bought. "
"3367880","3370360"," That actually looks like some dark pool buying down here at 412."
"3371180","3374640"," So we did touch for 12 down below, even if you didn't see it."
"3375300","3376760"," They tagged it right down here. "
"3380460","3384240"," So we'll see how far up this can go or where some resistances above."
"3387010","3390750"," 417.25 would be a place, a notable place above here."
"3392830","3396110"," 417.21 if you bought that dip. "
"3397750","3399290"," That tag down below here."
"3412210","3413590"," There's a V wop right here."
"3413730","3415550"," This is, this will be some minor resistance here. "
"3415930","3419750"," And then we've got 417.21 somewhere right up in here."
"3420250","3421550"," So our bears are waiting right up here."
"3422110","3426770"," Treasury Secretary Yellen just saying that she believes in market based values for the US dollars"
"3426770","3429880"," right up in here. "
"3430400","3436820"," Yellen saying she is unsure on the details of how Europe will cut away from Russian oil."
"3444520","3445000"," 1136."
"3447940","3449260"," What did I say 1130?"
"3452860","3453760"," Oh shit. "
"3454060","3455720"," How FMCs take place?"
"3460870","3462090"," 1136 to get a bounce."
"3462310","3463510"," I think I said 1130 to 1."
"3464050","3465110"," 130 or something."
"3470400","3475980"," Right down here for 12 and then above 417.15. You may get a little bit of resistance. "
"3476340","3476860"," They'll try to sort."
"3477200","3482340"," Treasury Secretary Yellen saying the US government is ready to respond to purposeful devaluations."
"3483080","3487040"," See a little bit of resistance coming up at 415.56 or so. "
"3487040","3496630"," Maybe 415.41. There'll be some sellers hiding there."
"3497810","3503230"," There'll be some sellers hiding above here 417.17. Mark those both."
"3504550","3507150"," We just mark the one and then you just follow V wop. "
"3508570","3509190"," Excuse me."
"3522930","3529570"," Secretary of State Yellen, the 1034 said that she feels quite good about the strength of the US"
"3529570","3529930"," economy."
"3529930","3532350"," Q1 negative GD preprint was a negative sign. "
"3532970","3534710"," Final sales grew 3% last quarter."
"3534810","3537210"," I feel is a better read on the strength of economy."
"3538090","3539570"," America is outperforming other countries. "
"3539750","3540610"," Inflation is too high."
"3540730","3541730"," It needs to be brought down."
"3542350","3546110"," IE, we're going to sacrifice the equities market. "
"3546550","3547230"," That's what she means."

"4266570","4271530"," But grind through this 858 30 and 800."

"4273770","4276790"," You're going to start you're going to start banging through levels down here. "
"4276910","4277030"," Okay."
"4278510","4280330"," So 800 is kind of your place."
"4280850","4282010"," That's your last stand. "
"4285450","4287530"," And there's light trading right now in Tesla."
"4289070","4291970"," So let's look at it on a lot of candlestick chart."
"4300980","4301720"," Same chart. "
"4301960","4302700"," Haven't changed it."
"4304300","4306100"," Haven't found fucker that haven't touched it."
"4310820","4312060"," You can see it here, right?"
"4313220","4314040"," This is bearish. "
"4315520","4317100"," Now I think it can come up from here, right?"
"4317280","4317340"," Yep."
"4317600","4319820"," You should be doing this trade in Tesla with the market."
"4320960","4323040"," So you have this initial drop down here, right?"
"4323420","4323740"," Rejection. "
"4324320","4324700"," Rejection."
"4325260","4325640"," Rejection."
"4327680","4330720"," And those lower lows that you're looking for, right?"
"4332780","4333140"," Right?"
"4334780","4338340"," If you start breaking, though, this 800, this is going to be a key for you. "
"4338560","4339760"," Mark this on your own chart."
"4339900","4342560"," If you start really not going down to 7, 8 and come back up."
"4343180","4347240"," If you start breaking this 800 line, it can get violent. "
"4347620","4349560"," It'll be a swift move down, believe it or not."
"4349860","4351460"," 756, 50 somewhere down in here."
"4353890","4355470"," Haven't made any changes to this chart. "
"4355730","4358130"," Nothing has changed on this chart."
"4358290","4359630"," I've added to it, but nothing has changed."
"4359790","4361190"," Even these have been here for a couple of weeks. "
"4363390","4365770"," I think it was a home hours blog or something."
"4365950","4368370"," I said, he said he bought it at $850, and I was like, that's a great buy."
"4370760","4371460"," It's a great buy. "
"4371900","4372100"," $850."
"4374440","4376600"," This is your defend line down here, right?"
"4380760","4385220"," If we get down to $4,000, and we actually start doing some real money selling, if you get panic"
"4385220","4387000"," in the market, they're not a dozen in the market."
"4387160","4388520"," That's just banks panic, real panic. "
"4389560","4394100"," You would definitely, you could swiftly see $650, $750, believe it or not."
"4397070","4398410"," But I'm in the mind that we go up today."
"4398410","4401750"," So if you're looking for a dip to buy today in weakness, where is that dip?"
"4404210","4405190"," We know where it is. "
"4405410","4408700"," Set $850, right down here."
"4417150","4419770"," So $850 is my price target for today, believe it or not."
"4419870","4421030"," Where we are right now?"
"4421810","4425970"," Not $8.95. I think it goes down another 50 points today. "
"4427170","4428330"," Into weakness into FOMC."
"4441700","4442280"," I think we get some weakness."
"4444520","4445380"," It's holding up well. "
"4445560","4450340"," This is like smoking a cigarette and being on the rings right now in the old school, the movie."
"4450340","4452180"," I mean, I'm still holding."
"4452580","4453320"," I'm still holding. "
"4454180","4455180"," I'm still holding."
"4457300","4458860"," This is dangerous trade holding here."
"4463730","4464450"," It's going to get rejected. "
"4470190","4472010"," The good thing is you get a lot of buyers down here."
"4472070","4472730"," We're looking for a dip."
"4472890","4474230"," This isn't like weakness here either. "
"4474450","4477850"," This is just dip buyers waiting for a buy down here on book map at least."
"4479270","4482470"," Looking to pick up anything they can on a positive fed statement."
"4483950","4485950"," Which I would expect out of Tesla bulls, right?"
"4486190","4487550"," This isn't like looking at a normal ticker. "
"4491720","4495220"," It was like looking at Tesla bulls will tell you that the market is always going up."
"4495440","4496820"," So you have to keep that in mind."
"4499120","4500740"," Can Tesla get to $8.50?"
"4502220","4511600"," They're going to hear some pretty bad news for it to get to $8.50. All right. "
"4511780","4530020"," So it's $12.07. See"
"4530020","4530400"," this right?"
"4530600","4531260"," Rejection here."
"4531960","4532600"," Trade it higher."
"4533160","4533480"," Off the bell. "
"4533720","4534480"," Sold it down below."
"4535300","4537620"," This is the current channel we're in."
"4537840","4539080"," We're actually trading below it right now. "
"4539900","4541120"," Is that light resistance?"
"4541460","4542560"," They want to keep it down below."
"4543700","4544180"," Right?"
"4544360","4544880"," Break below."
"4545220","4546400"," Some support from up here. "
"4547060","4547500"," Rejection."
"4547760","4548000"," Rejection."
"4548240","4548920"," We start heading lower. "
"4550910","4552910"," You want to see us get break above."
"4553290","4554390"," This is bullish up here, right?"
"4556050","4558090"," Maybe start doing this and then we're up higher."
"4562280","4563480"," Kind of just grinding around in here. "
"4576570","4577150"," Excuse me."
"4580610","4581050"," Wow."

"4609820","4611420"," We'll see if they can break through this."
"4611420","4613340"," Again, we're going to take one more stab at it here."
"4629060","4630140"," Yeah, they're up here hiding. "
"4634720","4635940"," They're definitely up here hiding."
"4640820","4644280"," 4.1750, 4.1648 and right where we are right now."
"4644660","4645980"," Those are still hiding there. "
"4660650","4663450"," Now, I wanted to buy that so bad and I'm like, I ain't buying it."
"4664350","4666130"," This is where I get caught, right?"
"4667390","4672110"," This is where I get caught where I'm going to buy that dip down there."
"4673310","4674530"," And then it rolls over. "

"4796070","4797670"," And I was like, I ain't fucking doing that. "
"4800510","4802290"," I have a business and all that kind of stuff."
"4802510","4807450"," So I had to talk to them and I ended up winning, believe it or not."
"4807630","4809390"," So they turned PayPal back on for me. "
"4810430","4814710"," So I'm very happy at this point that they've turned it back on."
"4815710","4818710"," But they prefer that I do like a monthly thing."
"4819010","4823850"," They want something where you're like signing up and I send you a receipt and say, thank you. "
"4824290","4825710"," This is what you're getting for a month."
"4826230","4828150"," But I did end up winning that case with PayPal."
"4829170","4831950"," So I'm very happy this morning in that sense of the word. "
"4832990","4838130"," I'm not being forced into what they're trying to force me into, which is a paid model."
"4838350","4839170"," And I don't like a paid model."
"4839430","4846470"," I would prefer the, if you're happy with what you're getting, I know it devalues what we're doing"
"4846470","4849210"," here, but it's not what I'm about. "
"4856300","4856860"," It's right here."
"4856940","4858660"," You see the same light resistance here."
"4860660","4862260"," Draw a little bull flag in here. "
"4862540","4863620"," Go into day bull flag."
"4870160","4871320"," Start of the one down here."
"4871640","4873060"," Let's move this out of the way at least. "
"4874340","4875720"," You can see we're dealing with here."
"4880880","4882840"," A little bit of shenanigans going on here."
"4884220","4885500"," See if we rip that thing higher. "
"4888360","4889000"," Move this over here."
"4894120","4895500"," See if we can get a little play going on."
"4896060","4897540"," A little intraday bull play. "
"4903180","4904260"," We'll check the sea over here."
"4905120","4906960"," If we blast off, price target above."
"4907900","4909400"," Four, seventeen, thirty. "
"4916800","4920080"," We'll just change resistance to price target."
"4930400","4931460"," So we'll switch this over here."
"4931800","4934000"," We'll change resistance to price target right here. "
"4934220","4935340"," For this four, seventeen, eighty."
"4937200","4941860"," You want to get like more technical about it."
"4944860","4946220"," We have light resistance here. "
"4946420","4946600"," We know."
"4947000","4947620"," We already know that, right?"
"4948100","4951820"," Trying to build up some, build up some, some bullishness here."
"4952320","4953980"," Get some more buyers to go in the market right here. "
"4954600","4956480"," Try to push this thing and blast off."
"4957140","4960060"," Be looking for, you know, something like this."
"4960380","4962000"," And then I'm cramping there. "
"4965450","4968590"," I'm going to have a lot of runway for an intraday trade."
"4985140","4986620"," Starting to move it on up in here."
"4988300","4990960"," Keep it right down here, right around that four, seventeen-ish. "
"4991840","4993740"," See if it gets there blasting up there or not."
"4994840","4995620"," So I walked in."
"4996880","4998360"," So I walked into the pit and twitted. "
"4998560","4999660"," Middle of the night, and I started blasting."
"5001420","5002420"," Still like that one."
"5004600","5009800"," I got really drunk late at night time. "
"5011060","5013520"," I started making posts that I shouldn't be posting about."
"5013680","5014340"," I'm pissing people off."
"5015820","5025770"," Last night I posted, I posted the, one of those things called, post of the, my little pony song,"
"5026550","5029970"," where you want to take a screwdriver and just grind your eyeballs out. "
"5031550","5035270"," I could, can you imagine like, can you imagine me like a prisoner and having to listen to that run"
"5035270","5037870"," repeat for like two days?"
"5038610","5039630"," Oh, it would take that long."
"5046700","5048080"," Some nice buyers in here."
"5048240","5049760"," It's nice to see these buyers in here. "
"5051360","5053120"," Lots of buyers down in here."
"5057520","5058460"," I might jump in here."
"5058660","5061400"," If we get, if we can get a little, just head down, I might jump in this trade. "
"5062540","5064420"," If we can get a little bit of this down here."
"5066300","5070880"," If we can get a little bit of, I think I want to miss the trade, but if we, if"
"5070880","5076760"," we get a little, if we get a little bit of, like that, I might take that trade for that"
"5076760","5077380"," right there."
"5078260","5080100"," That'd be a nice little serity play. "
"5084310","5086010"," Fuck around the market per minute or two."
"5088270","5098400"," 1216 in the afternoon, we're going to be expecting the FOMC at 2PM and then 230, both"
"5098400","5098680"," important."
"5098680","5103040"," They said that Biden came out and didn't try to step on the toes of, that was kind of crazy"
"5103040","5103340"," yesterday. "
"5104360","5107980"," They're going to release the report and they're also going to have Biden speaking at the same time."
"5108460","5109000"," Like that was insane."
"5112260","5113900"," Even, even consider that's insane. "
"5117740","5119860"," I'm a little happy that it was earlier or not later too."
"5120420","5123500"," It implies that not so hawkish fed, believe it or not."
"5125160","5130160"," Maybe you get like a president speaking after the Fed speaking, it's probably to calm the markets,"
"5130860","5132040"," to be honest with you. "
"5133740","5134520"," More than likely."
"5147240","5149640"," Oh, you couldn't then see that, you rainbow unicorn shit."
"5149820","5150440"," Oh yeah, that stuff. "
"5150680","5152620"," The worst part of it, you introduced me to it?"
"5153140","5153760"," My daughter."
"5154960","5156840"," And of course she played it for me like once."
"5158220","5159060"," And then I was on it. "
"5159180","5160740"," I was like, I was like, I like this."
"5160880","5161720"," I was like, I hate this song."
"5163340","5164800"," It's like, I'm never going to give you up song. "
"5165020","5168220"," It's totally mean, like, totally like, never going to give you up or whatever."
"5168220","5170200"," Or whatever that meme song is."
"5177860","5181840"," Yeah, so Alex is saying, I reckon you know, but PayPal does send 10 and nine forms to IRS over"
"5181840","5182000"," here. "
"5182100","5188860"," Yeah, so my, so just to be clear, I've had many business accounts with PayPal."
"5189280","5192340"," And this is a business account specifically for this channel."
"5196670","5198930"," But normally they like to see invoices. "
"5199390","5206150"," They want to see like a service, like a magazine or newsletter or something like that."
"5207950","5210030"," So everything is legit with my taxes."
"5210030","5210930"," Everything is legit. "
"5211190","5214830"," What they were, what they had said to me was that they had said, look, you get payments for like"
"5214830","5217990"," a dollar, three dollars, five dollars, seven dollars."
"5220550","5222550"," And you're not, what are you, what are you selling?"
"5223090","5224730"," Do you have, they're like, you have to provide."
"5227390","5231570"," You have to provide some kind of like proof that you're selling something. "
"5233890","5236170"," And you're like, you're selling something tangible."
"5236170","5238730"," Like you're paying for a month of access to this."
"5238950","5240390"," You're paying for this video. "
"5240410","5242010"," You're paying for this newsletter."
"5243490","5244330"," There we go."
"5244950","5246190"," There goes the spy baby. "
"5246910","5247610"," Blastin' off."
"5249590","5250650"," There it goes."
"5252790","5253310"," Squeezy. "
"5255070","5262290"," Price target for 17.50. So they're asking for like, that's what they're asking for."
"5262790","5265890"," So of course I have to go back in and try to fix it."
"5265890","5266830"," And of course they don't want to hear it. "
"5266850","5267870"," They just shut you down."
"5270140","5271560"," So of course I'm panicking."
"5271560","5275200"," I look up on YouTube and they're like, well not only can they freeze your accounts, but at some"
"5275200","5280720"," point they will close the account and you won't have access to money. "
"5280760","5281840"," You can't refund money."
"5281960","5286580"," And there's some real nasty shit that can take place for a lot of money, which supports this"
"5286580","5286900"," channel."
"5287140","5293840"," So I, of course I go on YouTube and I'm telling everybody, you have to just end all of your"
"5293840","5294280"," monthly tips. "
"5295460","5302760"," Like some people will send up for monthly's and also if they can get refunds I will because I don't"
"5302760","5305080"," want PayPal to keep your money either."
"5305620","5307060"," If I'm not getting it, you're not getting it."
"5307180","5307820"," I want them to keep it. "
"5307900","5309660"," So I'm going to send it back to you and they did give me that option."
"5311700","5316920"," But when they're talking to me about this, I had to explain to them in person, I had to explain"
"5316920","5317340"," to them."
"5321590","5322970"," Be careful as we come up here. "
"5323070","5327130"," I want you to know that though those sellers might be right here."
"5327850","5331630"," They can sometimes push down violently."
"5332090","5334790"," So you take a little off table as we head up towards this. "
"5335030","5335170"," Okay."
"5335410","5338230"," And we'll watch the book map to see if they're being pushed higher."
"5339350","5340430"," But currently they're not. "
"5340610","5343490"," So when they're not being pushed higher, they tend to swoop down."
"5343710","5345570"," There's a swooping down action on sellers."
"5345910","5347090"," So we'll look at that. "
"5348750","5350190"," That's a nice little trade right there."
"5350310","5350790"," One little rip."
"5351130","5352810"," Nice little bull flag, grip it up higher. "
"5353550","5354270"," Nice little under-day play."
"5354750","5357390"," See if it can get up to 417.50. It's up here."
"5357870","5359650"," It doesn't look like much right now, right?"
"5359970","5365870"," The key you're looking for is as we trade up here, you want to see if these sellers push higher. "
"5366450","5369070"," We are a little bit 418.27 currently."
"5369470","5370650"," You can see them up above."
"5370850","5372250"," You watch this number right here. "
"5372330","5375750"," If you see this number slide higher, not start swooping down."
"5376670","5379390"," You can get up to that target, that price target above."
"5379570","5384750"," So we'll keep the screen right as it is right now and pay attention to these sellers. "
"5385010","5385550"," See them right here?"
"5385990","5387530"," I'll give you more accurate price target."
"5387670","5392430"," 417 is where they are right now."
"5392430","5394490"," So we'll lower it on our candlestick part. "
"5396250","5400330"," We'll keep this one right here for you so we can track these sellers."
"5400830","5402790"," You don't want to see them swoop down right here, okay?"
"5403210","5404470"," You still have buyers here."
"5405130","5406850"," You still have buyers here. "
"5407430","5410050"," Trade and hire now, price target 417-14."
"5411110","5412090"," Beautiful bull flag."
"5412090","5415430"," If you're in calls right now, congratulations. "
"5422360","5431900"," So I had a talk with PayPal and the guy was like, no answer, no nothing."
"5433980","5435120"," Couldn't give me any information."
"5435900","5439380"," Just wanted my statements and wanted to see what I produced, right?"
"5440500","5442820"," And I have to tell them, you know, I don't charge for subscriptions. "
"5443300","5445040"," This is big right here watching this right now."
"5445040","5451320"," As we come up to this 417-14, some of the sellers have now moved higher to 418-83."
"5451640","5452860"," This is a big development here. "
"5453000","5453260"," We'll see."
"5453680","5457160"," There should be some resistance still at this 417-14."
"5457520","5461580"," So pull the plug, take your money, and then look for another leg up, believe it or not, to 419"
"5461580","5463380"," as long as these sellers don't come down. "
"5464120","5465880"," Huge moves here for this buy."
"5466820","5467240"," Enter a day."
"5467480","5467680"," Look at that. "
"5467900","5470680"," Huge moves for a price target at 417-14."
"5471380","5472720"," Nice little push higher here."
"5473640","5475280"," Beautiful little push higher here. "
"5476700","5482680"," Also, sellers being pushed higher from 417 up to 418 and 418-50 up and even higher."
"5483340","5485940"," So we'll see if we can punch through and get up there to 418."
"5486720","5488220"," Beautiful fucking move real quick. "
"5488400","5489120"," Cypress and swears."
"5490200","5495820"," A bear is being pushed back and above to believe it or not, 418-82."
"5496220","5497700"," So we'll see if they stay up there. "
"5497840","5498560"," We'll keep this here."
"5499220","5500500"," This is your first price target here."
"5500500","5502940"," 418-82 is quite high. "
"5508270","5509250"," Way up here."
"5510190","5511290"," Way up here."
"5512010","5513230"," So that's price target one. "
"5515660","5520340"," Be careful there's a cotton on this excitement too because they'll rug pull your ass at some point."
"5523340","5524340"," Give you all up in here."
"5524680","5527260"," Give you all up in here and then all of a sudden you'll be like, oh shit, it's 130. "
"5529460","5533160"," Price target two right here, above 4-1881 on the spy."
"5534480","5536820"," Nice little dip by, almost right at 11-30."
"5537240","5538760"," Boom, boom, not buying it. "
"5538820","5539340"," We're going higher."
"5543020","5544100"," Maybe it's a fed leak."
"5548740","5549340"," Hell yes. "
"5553190","5553590"," Gorgeous."
"5553810","5555870"," Some of these sellers now coming down real quick."
"5557150","5560010"," Plying some pressure to the spies by trying to tell you, hell no. "
"5560210","5561030"," We're not going up there."
"5564620","5567480"," So yeah, so then all of a sudden it was really weird too."
"5567660","5571120"," Like, yeah, I'm not blaming PayPal. "
"5574770","5575170"," Exactly."
"5575590","5576330"," Exactly winky."
"5576330","5576830"," You got it right. "
"5577030","5579730"," They don't like tips because there's no way to prove that they haven't gotten any value from"
"5579730","5579970"," anything."
"5581790","5582190"," Exactly."
"5582810","5583290"," I agree with that. "
"5585230","5587670"," Winky Paces absolutely knows what he's talking about."
"5589290","5594310"," So then by explaining what I do, as I had explained them, I was like, look, I was like, I"
"5594310","5595970"," don't like the idea of pay to play."
"5596090","5600150"," I like the idea of only pay if because they were wondering about chargebacks. "
"5602200","5604340"," They talked about chargebacks."
"5604500","5608240"," I was like, look, I was like, you get chargebacks when you charge somebody."
"5608240","5613220"," I was like, I was like, you want to know how you get chargebacks?"
"5614220","5618660"," And look, you get chargebacks from fucking charging somebody fucking $600 for the month. "
"5619660","5623860"," And then the fucking alpha guy doesn't show up until one of the afternoon twice a week."
"5627990","5629250"," That's how you get chargebacks."
"5631800","5634420"," Because people are like, what the fuck did I pay for?"
"5635980","5637340"," And I like my idea. "
"5637500","5645100"," My idea is you don't pay me unless I give you better alpha or I if you make a hundred"
"5645100","5648360"," bucks or a thousand bucks or five thousand or a hundred thousand."
"5649400","5651220"," You know, if you're like, fuck that guy ain't paying him."
"5651300","5652140"," Well, you know, fuck you too. "
"5652260","5653520"," I don't need you around me."
"5654100","5657400"," But I know there are trainers out there and investors out there that follow me here."
"5657460","5658860"," And they do support the channel. "
"5658980","5659960"," It's a core group of them."
"5660980","5661980"," And they're fucking awesome."
"5662820","5664220"," And I want those people around me. "
"5664840","5666800"," I'm friends of them outside of this too, right?"
"5667180","5668180"," You know who you all are out there."
"5668300","5669180"," There's a bunch of you out there."
"5669180","5674200"," Then God frees, Joe Harpers, Chas, Winky, Binky, Josh, Chad. "
"5674400","5676060"," There's the list goes on, Jill."
"5676720","5677820"," There's a ton of you out there."
"5678060","5679480"," Somebody out there, tip me like a dollar. "
"5679900","5681480"," You guys fucking, I love you the most."
"5685200","5686460"," So there's nothing to fucking hide here."
"5686720","5690360"," A lot of those alpha guys out there, all these channels and subscriptions that are sold, they hide"
"5690360","5691060"," behind that shit. "
"5691740","5696440"," And the fucked up part is they're charging you five hundred bucks, thousand bucks a month for"
"5696440","5696740"," churn."
"5697480","5701700"," They're charging you and you blow up your accounts and then the next group comes in and they're"
"5701700","5703020"," advertising for it."
"5703380","5704440"," And also they're fucking nonsense. "
"5705660","5707540"," And they're literally preying on new traders."
"5708280","5709240"," I'm not down with that shit."
"5710520","5712220"," I'm not down praying on new traders. "
"5712580","5716680"," I'm down on fucking teaching a trader how to make themselves some bread, some money."
"5719620","5720440"," That's what I'm here for."
"5722440","5726300"," And if you make money along the way, you'll tip me. "
"5728260","5729800"," People are serious about this shit."
"5729920","5731040"," This is their life as they do."
"5731520","5734300"," People are like, they eat shit and sleep stock market. "
"5736240","5737200"," I know how that is."
"5737300","5740900"," When I was learning on a trade, I was tipping people."
"5741360","5745420"," When I was learning on a trade, I blew my money on bullshit classes. "
"5746460","5748820"," I burned my money on bullshit trading rooms."
"5750100","5753820"," They go in there and then nobody wanted to tell me how to do things, how to learn."
"5754720","5759080"," They just gave them because they didn't know that it didn't dig a lot of me because they didn't"
"5759080","5760380"," understand a complex concept. "
"5760940","5763640"," And they would always explain it to me in a way that I couldn't understand it."
"5765710","5766650"," Yeah, that kind of shit."
"5767070","5767650"," I've been there. "
"5769710","5770950"," Price target right there."
"5771090","5771190"," Boom."
"5771530","5771850"," Nailed it. "
"5773190","5774610"," 4-17-13."
"5774990","5776270"," First price target achieved."
"5777270","5778150"," Now, do we get higher?"
"5778910","5780630"," Do we go to price target 2 at 1481?"
"5781950","5783210"," That's your next question, right?"
"5785010","5785450"," Boom. "
"5785910","5787310"," Bull flag traded up."
"5787370","5788870"," Slapped 4-17-13."
"5790810","5792550"," Question becomes, do we get it higher?"
"5795950","5797090"," Where do we go from there?"
"5797790","5799110"," This is a place to take some profit here. "
"5799870","5801110"," You want to leave a couple runners on?"
"5801270","5801450"," You can."
"5801710","5803350"," You want to look for some support down below?"
"5804510","5805870"," It's at 4-16-16."
"5807970","5811450"," Do you want to leave some runners to go up to what we've said it was 4-18?"
"5811750","5813070"," They're actually pushed up higher now. "
"5813970","5814930"," Bears are like shit."
"5814930","5816590"," 4-19-50."
"5819780","5821300"," 4-19-50. "
"5822200","5824440"," So right down here, you see the support down here?"
"5824540","5825000"," 4-16."
"5825340","5826740"," What is that?"
"5827340","5828380"," 4-16-30."
"5828560","5829420"," 4-16-20. "
"5831600","5832720"," 4-16-20."
"5832900","5833700"," 4-16-20."
"5833920","5834320"," Somewhere in there. "
"5834560","5835240"," Right, we're going to move that up."
"5836260","5838760"," We're going to put some lines on the chart today."
"5839920","5840560"," Right down in here somewhere. "
"5842000","5843680"," A little bit of support down here."
"5843840","5844860"," Right down in here is some support."
"5846020","5847440"," With that support down here, right?"
"5847680","5848760"," We have that 4-18-81. "
"5848940","5850160"," We have 4-19 above."
"5850980","5852120"," So we're going to check that one more time."
"5852220","5852380"," Look at that. "
"5852580","5853740"," 4-19-50."
"5853860","5855920"," 4-19-50."
"5856780","5858380"," We have price target 2 here. "
"5859240","5860320"," It's actually been pushed up higher."
"5861240","5862720"," It's 4-19 flat actually."
"5864040","5865660"," And it's 4-19-50 over here. "
"5866080","5866600"," Somewhere in there."
"5866820","5868040"," We're going to do that."
"5868200","5868960"," We're going to do this over here. "
"5870160","5871600"," We're going to just do a box over here."
"5873100","5873740"," Right there."
"5874080","5874540"," There it is. "
"5876480","5877960"," Yeah, first price target here."
"5878020","5879200"," We get next price target above."
"5880260","5882040"," We know we get some firm support down here. "
"5882240","5883260"," 4-16-inter date."
"5883660","5884140"," Support down here."
"5884180","5885760"," 4-16-10-37. "
"5886120","5886220"," Right?"
"5886940","5887840"," So what are we looking for?"
"5888520","5890600"," We're either looking for some support."
"5891340","5892100"," Trade down."
"5893820","5893980"," Or. "
"5895420","5897000"," We're going to be looking for rejection here."
"5897560","5898380"," Start trading it down."
"5899720","5900260"," And then bam. "
"5900400","5901480"," You get your next shot up over here."
"5901640","5901740"," Okay?"
"5904020","5907180"," Get all that bearishness out of me this morning at the beginning of the morning, right?"
"5907460","5908980"," Get all that bearishness out of me."
"5911800","5913660"," Get all that bearishness out of me this morning. "
"5915660","5919600"," And then what we can do is we can do is we can come to bear."
"5921940","5922760"," Thank you, Joe."
"5923180","5924500"," Yes, my love. "
"5925420","5926300"," It's okay again."
"5926560","5927220"," I won my case."
"5927580","5928540"," I'm surprised I won't. "
"5928640","5929300"," Dude, I was off."
"5929640","5930240"," I can tell you what."
"5930620","5933660"," I was like, there ain't no fucking way I'm going to win this shit. "
"5933760","5934760"," I'm like, it's big, bad PayPal."
"5936400","5937400"," I'll be honest with you."
"5937400","5938540"," I was like, there ain't no fucking way. "
"5938700","5939660"," I even called up Joe Harper."
"5939880","5940880"," I'm like, I'm totally fucked."
"5941460","5943060"," I'm like, I am totally fucked here. "
"5943200","5944520"," I'm like, there's no way."
"5944760","5950140"," Dude, if you guys deal with banks or pay in processes or any of that kind of stuff, it's like"
"5950140","5953480"," a dark black chasm that you never, you never climb out of."
"5954560","5955820"," You never win that shit. "
"5956500","5960360"," Even like, if you have a problem with any company, Amazon, it doesn't matter what it is, you're"
"5960360","5960800"," kind of fucked."
"5961500","5962840"," Okay, so what are we going to look for here?"
"5964120","5967620"," If there is rejection, we're going to start drawing ourselves, we're going to start drawing our"
"5967620","5968920"," first line like that."
"5969680","5971040"," How do you get your second line?"
"5971200","5971900"," Well, we're going to make a parallel. "
"5973300","5973700"," Right?"
"5973960","5974800"," Real simple stuff here."
"5976040","5976440"," Right?"
"5978540","5979220"," Just like that."
"5981120","5982700"," We got our first price target, right?"
"5983260","5986040"," We're going to follow that down right here, and we're going to look for our next one. "
"5987380","5988200"," Right down there."
"5989400","5990400"," So what do you do here?"
"5991780","5994300"," This is your cut, your losses down here, right?"
"5994660","5995980"," You don't want to be breaking this, right?"
"5996140","5997460"," We didn't break it down here, right?"
"5998180","5999300"," You're looking for this to hold."
"5999540","6002100"," If this line right here holds, then I'm clicked on. "
"6002440","6004720"," If that holds, we're still bullish, right?"
"6004820","6005600"," We're still trading higher."
"6006240","6007140"," Last thing we got to think about."
"6007520","6009720"," It's now 12.32 in the afternoon, dicking around. "
"6010940","6018240"," Remember, we could get some weakness at 1.30, 2 o'clock, 2.30. Otherwise, we're going to see if"
"6018240","6020660"," we can make another ripper here a pyre."
"6022140","6023080"," We're trading the spy."
"6023460","6024860"," Pumping and dumping the spy every day. "
"6025560","6026460"," I love the fucking spy."
"6027880","6028820"," It's so easy."
"6030600","6031800"," So why work hard?"
"6033700","6035100"," I don't know why you'd work hard. "
"6036240","6037060"," This is no need."
"6037280","6039460"," We'll see if we'll break through or if we're going to pull back here."
"6040280","6042080"," You can see here on this chart. "
"6042240","6043480"," There's a little bit of resistance here."
"6043480","6044400"," I want you to see that, OK?"
"6044800","6051020"," There is still some resistance here at 4.17.13. There's still some resistance about 4.17.36. So if"
"6051020","6051560"," you're like, hey, Cap."
"6051900","6054840"," If you're like, hey, Cap, we're going to break right out right now. "
"6054900","6056860"," We're not even going to turn around and cap for more support."
"6057060","6057840"," We're not turning around, Cap."
"6057960","6058220"," I promise. "
"6058780","6060200"," So you want to jump back into your trade?"
"6064660","6065240"," We'll run here."
"6066120","6066900"," Just give it a minute."
"6067220","6068940"," Let it start here, OK?"
"6070420","6071300"," And then take it, OK?"
"6071740","6073120"," Just wait for this break above. "
"6074360","6076960"," Wait for the break above that volatility."
"6078300","6079500"," You can jump right back in."
"6081780","6083940"," Give some velocity to the move straight up. "
"6089340","6091040"," Otherwise, you're buying again down here."
"6092160","6092880"," Just as a heads up."
"6098220","6098980"," What are you saying?"
"6099200","6102060"," One time someone sent me a survey and a year long nutrition coaching thing online. "
"6102320","6105080"," I gave them a 6.10 and they refunded all of them money for the entire year."
"6105320","6106520"," Sometimes companies are cool."
"6107300","6108680"," They felt bad because they used it a bunch. "
"6109140","6111180"," But they didn't ask them to refund me all of them."
"6113220","6113780"," Spypumproom, baby."
"6118080","6118660"," I love you, Joe. "
"6124520","6125220"," Hey, Matt."
"6126180","6126540"," Seminary."
"6126720","6127500"," Thanks for working, brother. "
"6128420","6129400"," Appreciate you, too, my man."
"6134200","6134840"," Right on, Will."
"6139160","6140180"," I love you, Joe Harper. "
"6144520","6145500"," I love everybody out there."
"6145780","6147380"," Five bucks a dollar."
"6147520","6147800"," I don't care. "
"6147920","6148720"," Just a like and a subscribe."
"6149060","6149360"," I don't care."
"6150100","6151000"," I appreciate that, too. "
"6160430","6161190"," Do you remember that shit?"
"6161450","6161670"," Yeah."
"6162370","6163070"," I'll get in there, Cody."
"6163070","6163730"," I got you covered. "
"6167230","6168370"," I got you covered, brother."
"6174760","6175580"," I love all you guys."
"6178300","6179360"," Cap kicking ass again. "
"6179520","6179800"," Fuck you."
"6179860","6180600"," I ever kicking ass again."
"6181360","6182580"," Doing this shit every day. "
"6185100","6191260"," I was talking about this with Chate and the other day and with Joe about how you can't learn this"
"6191260","6192260"," shit by a video."
"6193460","6194500"," Even a training class."
"6194780","6196120"," I got a bunch of them. "
"6196200","6200700"," I should post them for you guys on at Captain's Office so you can see what you pay for."
"6200900","6202020"," I got a shit ton of them."
"6202560","6203780"," I actually have them. "
"6203780","6207900"," If I can host them somewhere and let you guys watch them, they're a joke."
"6210130","6214030"," How do you explain price action to someone in a training class?"
"6214730","6215970"," I don't know how you do that."
"6218200","6219640"," Do you get one every single day?"
"6220180","6223920"," You're literally every day sitting here with me and you're getting one every single day. "
"6224440","6225400"," Am I going to be right all the time?"
"6225580","6226660"," No, but it doesn't matter."
"6227200","6231540"," What matters is that you've got someone sitting next to you talking about price action."
"6232180","6233680"," Talking about where the market's currently going. "
"6234120","6239060"," Talking about current events, market sentiments, and setups."
"6239800","6240760"," Where are the setups at?"
"6243680","6244780"," Looks like this is going to bust through."
"6244940","6245420"," It looks like it. "
"6245600","6246000"," I don't know here."
"6246180","6247840"," We'll check here and see if it's going to break through or not."
"6248340","6249480"," A lot of sellers still here. "
"6250320","6251020"," Be careful here."
"6251760","6254440"," If you are still in right now, you have another chance though."
"6254800","6259040"," You could diamond hand this to break through and then if it bounces back down, you add to your"
"6259040","6260000"," position to get up to 419. "
"6263050","6264390"," You can't teach this shit in a video."
"6266410","6267210"," You can't."
"6267530","6268170"," You cannot. "
"6269890","6273550"," But of course, if you're a new investor, you're trying to suck up those videos and you're like,"
"6273710","6275850"," okay, I compare it to skiing."
"6277610","6278970"," I always compare it to skiing."
"6279310","6283590"," If I made you a video on how to ski, I used to teach skiing. "
"6283990","6286890"," I even taught adaptive skiing at a time."
"6287070","6288330"," That was on a ski team for a long time."
"6288510","6289030"," Pretty good skier. "
"6289590","6291110"," I lived in the mountain towns for a long time."
"6291970","6295530"," I could make you a, I could, I could close my eyes and make you a ski video on how"
"6295530","6296610"," to, how to ski, learn how to ski."
"6297370","6299310"," You see these sellers here that are coming down now. "
"6300470","6301550"," They're getting feisty."
"6302950","6305110"," Just take four thirds, four, 17, 35."
"6305550","6308970"," I would recommend at this point, you take money off the table. "
"6309450","6310930"," These sellers weren't here before."
"6311130","6316370"," We can go to 419.50. But they're coming down now for you, okay?"
"6318150","6319130"," They are coming down."
"6319130","6321670"," I spent a little bit of time here. "
"6321770","6322330"," They're going to come down there."
"6322430","6323630"," They're starting to get bound up in here."
"6326720","6328460"," We have, we're losing runway too. "
"6328540","6329140"," It's 1237."
"6329500","6331700"," We have an hour left until some real volatility."
"6332220","6336720"," There are some spied buyers coming in right now that is contrarian to what I'm telling you right"
"6336720","6337000"," now. "
"6338420","6340100"," But this gets very risky where we are."
"6340820","6341700"," Risk is high."
"6343800","6345440"," But if you and I were out there skiing, right?"
"6345640","6349800"," When you and I spent like a week skiing together, you'd be up in skiing quite well. "
"6350640","6355840"," You'd be competent to at least ski greens, green circles in a week."
"6356260","6357160"," It was every day per week."
"6357960","6364680"," If I ski with you all season, you'd be skiing bumps on blue blue squares with meaner meat trails by"
"6364680","6374230"," end of season and getting scared on simple black diamonds and stuff. "
"6376980","6379880"," I don't think you can pay for a class for that."
"6380320","6382740"," I don't think there is that money is there in a class."
"6383700","6384960"," Some of it is for fundamentals. "
"6385500","6389800"," But if you really want that, you really want those fundamentals, why buy it?"
"6390200","6391900"," You just go to options industry council."
"6392680","6393240"," They're free."
"6396300","6397260"," Optionsindustrycouncil.org."
"6397800","6398820"," The CME puts it out. "
"6400020","6404080"," Starting to squeeze higher now, going to $4.19.50 is the price target above here."
"6404860","6408940"," Currently trading at $4.17.55.56 on the spy."
"6411080","6414280"," Bear's coming in trying to hold off here. "
"6418480","6426540"," But if you really want the fundamentals, the options industry council has videos backed by the CME."
"6428000","6429920"," So you know they're dry."
"6431480","6436680"," It's like swallowing like a peanut butter sandwich in a desert. "
"6437920","6441940"," But if you want the fundamentals of the market, that's your answer."
"6441940","6451050"," You don't need to be paying somebody $600 a month and not having them there every day of the week."
"6455540","6459000"," We've got moderators here like Winky and Josh, your wife's boyfriend. "
"6459160","6464060"," We've got some people inside the Discord, gangster traders, straight gangsters."
"6465980","6467660"," Always dropping bombs."
"6469280","6469920"," Bombs. "
"6471280","6471600"," Free."
"6477470","6478310"," Like straight bombs."
"6481830","6482610"," Gel netto. "
"6482810","6483650"," Drop straight bombs."
"6484050","6485870"," There's a whole bunch of you guys out there that drop some bombs."
"6488090","6489850"," Spork A comes in and drops some bombs. "
"6490270","6494110"," We've got people that just joined the conversation livestream drop bombs."
"6496920","6497880"," Look at this ticker."
"6497980","6498740"," Look at that ticker. "
"6499840","6501940"," Someone was just out there talking about looking at a larger timeframe."
"6506420","6507520"," Bad ass crew of people."
"6508080","6508940"," Bad ass crew of traders. "
"6509340","6510200"," Bad ass crew of investors."
"6516800","6518260"," Spy trying to make a support here."
"6518480","6519580"," This is nice to see, right?"
"6519580","6523860"," Break above this channel here, right?"
"6524460","6525060"," Break above. "
"6525280","6527440"," Try to create some support here at 417."
"6529640","6531600"," Lots of sellers up here."
"6531740","6547740"," They're starting to gang up above for 1950. "
"6549100","6550400"," Still on the table."
"6551300","6552840"," Like seeing this down here."
"6552980","6554420"," There's some nice support down here. "
"6554440","6557960"," Do you see this support right at 417 or so?"
"6557960","6563920"," So we're talking about more support than we had before, right?"
"6564360","6566540"," So now you're turning this into support."
"6566740","6573060"," This little flag that didn't materialize is now turning into a stronger support area down below"
"6573060","6573600"," here, right?"
"6574220","6576080"," So you've now got some support in here."
"6576200","6576880"," I'll change this. "
"6582670","6584210"," We don't want this to break."
"6584630","6588960"," I'm starting to build some support in here."
"6589420","6590800"," Just in this area here. "
"6598220","6599600"," You can see it down in here."
"6599660","6600320"," I'll show it to you."
"6603550","6605090"," This is nice support in here. "
"6605090","6607350"," Anywhere from here, 417 down to 415."
"6608470","6609910"," Now start to turn into some support."
"6610150","6611250"," We'll see if we can bring it up closer. "
"6612670","6613330"," We can identify."
"6613750","6614950"," We don't want to see a rug pull happen."
"6622630","6626110"," You can see it closely down in here to 416. "
"6626650","6627370"," You see it right here?"
"6628450","6634650"," That's 416.64. Come back to a panel six chart."
"6634850","6637950"," 416.64. Right down in here."
"6639090","6639450"," Right here. "
"6639670","6640290"," We'll put it right here."
"6641890","6643090"," Some support right there."
"6651130","6656250"," I'm probably talking about a still 419.50. See if the bulls can hold on to it. "
"6657490","6667360"," Make it on a run for 419.50. Or excuse me, 419.50. Keep your"
"6667360","6670940"," eyes on the clock as we head into the FOMC statement."
"6675240","6680940"," Don't want to get caught up here trying to fuck around and have some volatility into the market."
"6681180","6682140"," Keep your eyes on the VIX. "
"6688810","6692630"," The VIX is bottoming out around 428.45 right now."
"6697560","6700380"," The beautiful thing is I got to draw some, I got to, I got to, I got to, I got"
"6700380","6704340"," to, I got to crayon scratch some, some levels down here."
"6704480","6705580"," We'll do that together real quick. "
"6707800","6709020"," Real simple stuff, right?"
"6709780","6710720"," No rocket scientists."
"6711060","6712940"," We don't need to be rocket scientists in this, right?"
"6713860","6714960"," Another one down in here."
"6718780","6720760"," This would be where the break is, right?"
"6721040","6722640"," Where your free fall down in the VIX. "
"6723480","6726580"," To be kind of like the last place for the, this would be the VIX holdouts."
"6727160","6735720"," If you're a, if you're a VIX bull, this is where the stops are for VIX bulls."
"6739910","6741250"," So you squeeze right here. "
"6752430","6754210"," Huge bid in the market right now."
"6754890","6756450"," Huge bid in the market right now."
"6759890","6760610"," Huge bid. "
"6770970","6771270"," Huge."
"6772330","6773370"," They were buyers."
"6774210","6774930"," They were buyers. "
"6775310","6777210"," This market as we went down, I want to show you this."
"6783180","6789220"," I'm giving you shows on a better, this is horrible."
"6789220","6790540"," Look at all that mess down there. "
"6794480","6795960"," I need a different chart to show you guys."
"6797380","6798540"," Let me show you a different chart."
"6798680","6798880"," Hold on. "
"6800180","6801540"," Trying to scale out of this shit."
"6801700","6803080"," That's some horrible looking charting."
"6803980","6805360"," I got to go back and delete a bunch of this shit. "
"6805420","6809900"," Trying to leave it on there as long as I can so that, so that I can go back and"
"6809900","6812320"," see where I failed and where I was successful."
"6812900","6814620"," It's like a, it's like a, it's like a diary."
"6817690","6821610"," So we're going to take a look at the different chart here. "
"6835940","6838240"," Let me use the spy specifically today."
"6841000","6842140"," A larger time frame."
"6842420","6842920"," This is the spy. "
"6844180","6846560"," And we're going to add the market prep indicator."
"6846940","6847840"," Most of you know what this is."
"6851770","6852710"," So you don't. "
"6854370","6857310"," I use the Iceman ran one open source, which is awesome."
"6858630","6859610"," Guy after my own heart."
"6863010","6864470"," Tied nothing by the paywall. "
"6866110","6867590"," We'll let this load up and see."
"6871920","6873760"," Buyers stepping in pushing up, right?"
"6873880","6875420"," We're not added in decision candle anymore."
"6876700","6877420"," Currently at least. "
"6878260","6879320"," Market's being bought, right?"
"6879860","6880340"," Market bought here."
"6880500","6881440"," Market, market bought here."
"6881940","6885500"," Same thing currently happening right now in the spy on a daily chart at least. "
"6887420","6888480"," We'll let this load up."
"6888600","6889520"," It's starting to load up, right?"
"6889660","6895060"," We dipped way down here to the depths of hell in the market breadth indicator."
"6895060","6898140"," You can see that the market's being bought right now, right?"
"6898700","6899740"," Buy in this market. "
"6900300","6902040"," It's supposed to be the most volatile day."
"6902860","6904640"," And yet people are buying here."
"6911340","6912700"," Telling a different story. "
"6915520","6916560"," And what we're being fed."
"6923410","6925410"," Buyers down below to 41496."
"6926690","6929110"," That would be the deepest weakness that you would see right now. "
"6929710","6930250"," 41490."
"6941860","6944220"," Give you some key levels here, okay?"
"6944980","6945560"," Key levels."
"6945560","6946880"," 416-14. "
"6948280","6950160"," And 415-42."
"6951980","6954720"," You can see the seller's swooping in right now."
"6954860","6956560"," They're still above at 419-50. "
"6956680","6957700"," They haven't swooped in yet."
"6958280","6959860"," But they are getting a little aggressive here."
"6967650","6969910"," This is the same candlestick chart down here. "
"6970890","6972370"," So 414 down in here."
"6972490","6975010"," This is where the bulls are at down here."
"6977020","6978880"," Key support, right where we are right now. "
"6979220","6981460"," And then don't forget down here's kind of key over here."
"6982540","6988140"," Yeah, somewhere in this area here and here."
"6988840","6991940"," And some key support. "
"6992600","6992880"," Key."
"6994880","6997520"," Actually, we just had our key taken away from us right now, didn't we?"
"6998820","7001440"," Trying to tell people they can't have abortions and stuff."
"7002060","7008840"," Tell you what, regardless of what side of the political spectrum you're on, you don't want women to"
"7008840","7009400"," get together. "
"7011360","7014200"," Try telling women you're going to control their bodies and stuff."
"7016740","7023640"," Tell you what, it locked that shit up and they locked that shit up right in..."
"7025560","7028820"," Men are going to be in for a rude awakening."
"7029780","7030300"," Rude. "
"7031320","7033400"," Men can be stupid as fuck."
"7034140","7034560"," Stupid."
"7036260","7039400"," I don't know how many of you are in a relationship out there. "
"7043600","7050910"," But as I've grown older, I have learned that it's better to pick your battles."
"7052350","7057790"," That doesn't mean that, you know, you or your wife chooses to do those things or not or whoever,"
"7057970","7062450"," but even in those relationships, doesn't matter if you're for or against it, but just in any"
"7062450","7063210"," relationship."
"7064690","7068290"," Or at least for me and my experience with most women. "
"7070330","7073490"," They prefer that I stay out of certain things."
"7074630","7075510"," It's none of my business."
"7076490","7077550"," I kind of like that. "
"7077730","7080830"," It kind of works for me."
"7081370","7083030"," I've had best success that way."
"7083790","7086910"," So if I have to win something, I'll make that known. "
"7087110","7088030"," I'll be like, hey, I've got to win this."
"7089110","7089910"," Especially when I meet them, right?"
"7089990","7090430"," I've got to win this."
"7090570","7091250"," I've got to win that or whatever. "
"7091450","7092990"," But to some shit I don't get involved in."
"7095590","7096890"," None of my fucking business."
"7099370","7107570"," I heard somebody yesterday said what we should do is we should give every young boy where I sniff"
"7107570","7110830"," their balls or vasectomy when they're of age. "
"7110830","7111770"," Just sniff their balls."
"7112090","7114450"," Then you find out if they want to make babies or something."
"7114710","7116290"," I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we can't do that shit. "
"7116890","7120350"," And my wife was like, what do you mean we can't do that shit to you?"
"7121950","7123050"," I was like, yeah, you got a point."
"7124130","7125490"," I don't want to fuck with my body."
"7126950","7128950"," I was like, I don't want you making decisions for me. "
"7129850","7130430"," Sound familiar?"
"7133530","7135070"," It doesn't matter what your take is on it either."
"7135070","7137870"," It just matters, you know, my business or not."
"7138030","7138310"," Here we go. "
"7138430","7142490"," We might have another rip higher here coming up here."
"7143750","7145550"," We're like, no, I don't want anything to do with that shit."
"7146350","7151460"," I don't want my business right in here. "
"7152780","7154040"," Let's see if this rolls over."
"7154200","7155100"," If this is a nice play here."
"7157580","7159520"," 430 C's are now 83 cents. "
"7159740","7161060"," They were down to like 50's, right?"
"7161380","7164740"," 30's now getting some call premium built into them."
"7165500","7167540"," 430 C's were down to like, what?"
"7167860","7168380"," 40 cents?"
"7168600","7170040"," They're now up to 85 cents."
"7171140","7172120"," Expiring on Friday. "
"7174060","7175000"," Almost double."
"7175360","7176400"," Almost at 100%."
"7179880","7180800"," Almost double. "
"7190060","7190140"," Yeah."
"7195220","7200020"," Yeah, I mean, honestly, I feel like I'm anti doing, I'm anti abortion, whatever."
"7200020","7201480"," I'm like, good, great. "
"7203340","7204380"," I understand."
"7205240","7206940"," I just, I don't get involved with that."
"7206940","7211440"," I don't try to, with women and shit like that, I'm just, no, no, my fucking business. "
"7212820","7218940"," I couldn't imagine like, could imagine like someone trying to tell me as a man, you have to get a"
"7218940","7220160"," vasectomy 18 years old."
"7220540","7221220"," That shit ain't happening."
"7223100","7224340"," That shit ain't happening. "
"7226630","7227370"," You know what I mean?"
"7227650","7228630"," You guys get what I'm saying here?"
"7232380","7232820"," Boom."
"7233560","7234360"," Let's see if that happens."
"7237380","7238120"," They're trying. "
"7238720","7239360"," Bulls are trying."
"7239360","7241520"," Be careful of this if this is a double top."
"7241660","7242620"," But this is a lot of strength here. "
"7242740","7243300"," It just heads up."
"7243760","7244620"," A ton of strength here."
"7245060","7245460"," 1253. "
"7246320","7247220"," Have an hour left."
"7248140","7250480"," Bulls want to get up to 4, 4, 19, 90."
"7250640","7251400"," Building some support here. "
"7251540","7252460"," We are building some support."
"7253020","7254840"," Whether you like this or not, this is becoming support."
"7255040","7255860"," This is nice to see. "
"7257180","7258500"," Nice little bull flag."
"7258680","7259860"," Once again, above, right?"
"7261260","7264400"," We're going to leave this one here in case there's a bounce lower."
"7265280","7266580"," Here's some weakness here. "
"7267580","7268880"," We'll just leave that one there."
"7268880","7269420"," Just in case."
"7271560","7274180"," Just leave behind a path of writing on. "
"7275260","7276580"," We're going to look up a little bit."
"7277480","7278780"," It's nice to see right there."
"7279060","7279820"," Always good to see. "
"7281400","7282760"," We'll look up higher a little bit."
"7284580","7285840"," And see if we're coming into this."
"7286040","7287660"," See this here. "
"7287920","7288400"," Look at this."
"7290340","7291540"," You see look back here."
"7291640","7293260"," You've got 4, 18, 93 here. "
"7293500","7295800"," You've got a top above here at 4, 18, 47."
"7297220","7299060"," We'll draw a little line in here."
"7301800","7303400"," It's getting messy already. "
"7307660","7308980"," It's getting messy already."
"7309160","7310260"," I can already see it's getting messy."
"7315040","7316420"," See if we can blast this higher. "
"7316860","7317740"," Get up to that price target."
"7318020","7319820"," 4, 19, 50 is where we're going."
"7320720","7321960"," 4, 19, 50. "
"7333200","7334140"," Yeah, I don't understand it."
"7334280","7335380"," I don't want to get involved in it."
"7346070","7348150"," Now trading 4, 17, 72. "
"7349470","7350830"," New high on the day."
"7352210","7353490"," This little line right here."
"7353490","7356890"," This is the previous plane of rejection up here. "
"7357570","7360370"," Things are going to get dangerous as we come up into these levels here."
"7361090","7363290"," They will get dangerous as we get up here."
"7363670","7365530"," Point of rejection yesterday as well. "
"7366030","7368470"," Two times we sold off right in this area here."
"7372300","7374100"," Start singing highway to the danger zone up here."
"7377090","7379970"," Highway to the danger zone. "
"7380490","7381970"," 4, 17, 96 now."
"7382210","7382530"," 4, 18."
"7383870","7385010"," Slamming it up at 4, 18. "
"7385010","7386070"," 14, 04."
"7386910","7387310"," Whoo!"
"7389850","7390510"," Very nice."
"7393000","7393820"," Very nice. "
"7394420","7394760"," Broke through."
"7394980","7395840"," This broke some shorts."
"7396780","7399660"," Some shorts were just broken there for a moment. "
"7400460","7400820"," Look at that."
"7401020","7402740"," Just smashing on shorts in here."
"7406700","7407580"," Just slamming up. "
"7407740","7409500"," This triggered some closing of shorts here."
"7411560","7412160"," Nasty."
"7415200","7417940"," Nasty reaction at that level at 4, 18, 04. "
"7418220","7418620"," Nasty."
"7423700","7424920"," Bear rage here."
"7425680","7426640"," Slapping it up there. "
"7426800","7427420"," 14, 08."
"7428240","7429600"," Quick, quick, quick."
"7438360","7439920"," I have to try to like slide that over there. "
"7442240","7443760"," Violent moves heading up."
"7444540","7446560"," Big coming into the market across the board."
"7446760","7447880"," We got spy call buyers. "
"7448200","7448620"," They don't care."
"7448840","7449640"," We don't care."
"7449760","7450180"," We're going up. "
"7451060","7453420"," We got apple buyers and video buyers."
"7454700","7455620"," JPM buyers."
"7456100","7457280"," What else we got over here for buyers?"
"7459600","7460500"," Spy cues. "
"7460780","7461360"," Tesla buyers."
"7463440","7464840"," Spy in the index today."
"7464960","7466100"," They don't care right now. "
"7466180","7467220"," If I was a bear, I'd be scared here."

"7762590","7763830"," 4-18-40."
"7764690","7765910"," Bears in disarray."
"7766110","7766910"," They don't know what to do. "
"7767450","7769170"," They're losing money out there right now."
"7769170","7773390"," Anyone that was short is now has to flip and buy the market."
"7773650","7774910"," 4-18-43. "
"7776590","7780220"," Where are we going?"
"7780540","7781660"," We're going to squeeze it up here right?"
"7782060","7783180"," High volatility days."
"7784100","7785420"," Give me that price target."
"7785720","7787120"," Give me 4-19-50. "
"7788220","7789080"," We called it."
"7789220","7789780"," Let's do it."
"7790640","7791240"," Get it up there. "
"7791900","7792360"," Push it."
"7793460","7795600"," Send those fucking spy calls in."
"7795740","7797960"," I see them in the options flow. "
"7799940","7801340"," Spend a million dollars."
"7802260","7804060"," Get it up to 4-19-50."
"7804220","7806980"," I don't know if we're getting there, but the bears are still being pushed up. "
"7807100","7808900"," Now they're pushed up here to 4-20-12."
"7810560","7812600"," You want to give them a little bit of homage to the old man."
"7812700","7815140"," You just do 4-20-69 up here. "
"7815960","7818680"," There it is right there, 4-20-69 right around there."
"7820080","7821760"," Bears staggering back right now."
"7822080","7822900"," Not coming down. "
"7823500","7826660"," Their next goal, their next place is that they're being pushed up."
"7826660","7827900"," Now you can see them on the right-hand side."
"7828060","7829920"," They're now up to 4-20. "
"7831240","7832120"," Forget 1950."
"7833220","7834220"," Look at 4-20."
"7837320","7838160"," Right up in here. "
"7839460","7841700"," I should say it's here resistance is 4-20."
"7842540","7845760"," On a small, on a bigger chart, that's what gets all weird up there."
"7846540","7846840"," Try in the middle. "
"7847460","7848480"," 4-18-47."
"7851060","7852320"," See what's going on here."
"7853320","7853620"," Blasting. "
"7854480","7854920"," Blasting."
"7855240","7855620"," Blasting."
"7857000","7857840"," What support?"
"7858760","7861080"," This line right here becomes where we know that, right?"
"7861380","7863100"," We know this line becomes support here. "
"7863780","7865780"," This line, they want to turn into support."
"7868470","7868910"," Why?"
"7869450","7870910"," Because this was resistance yesterday."
"7880270","7882090"," You want to turn this into support here. "
"7882190","7883230"," Why do you want to turn into support?"
"7884390","7886470"," Because resistance becomes support."
"7889230","7890670"," So we want to see this here."
"7891150","7891210"," Hold. "
"7894810","7895850"," We want to see something in here."
"7895850","7896310"," Hold."
"7897410","7899270"," Okay, we want to see this hold in here. "
"7900790","7905310"," If this doesn't hold, we will roll it down, okay?"
"7906090","7907010"," We want this to hold."
"7907170","7908350"," We don't want a rejection here."
"7909830","7913750"," We want a rejection look like something like this and then down. "
"7915570","7917490"," We don't want to see that, okay?"
"7918710","7920170"," We don't want to see that here."
"7925550","7926750"," So close to where we're going."
"7930620","7931360"," We'll leave it right here. "
"7931360","7933140"," We want to turn that into support."
"7933620","7938620"," If you're trying to crude futures, extending gains up more than 5% when it's 756."
"7938820","7939720"," We're going to tag down below. "
"7940060","7941580"," They want to push it down here so bad."
"7942220","7944240"," They want to roll this over."
"7944520","7945780"," This is the resistance from yesterday. "
"7946440","7947220"," You guys remember, right?"
"7947800","7948880"," See the angle on this right here?"
"7949860","7951220"," They want to roll this over."
"7951640","7952400"," This is what bear wants."
"7952920","7954080"," We want to get bears for a minute. "
"7954240","7956120"," Bears like, we want to send it down here, cap."
"7957240","7958600"," Then we want to bounce it twice."
"7958800","7960420"," We want to send this thing down. "
"7961000","7962440"," Bears like, what time is it right now?"
"7962500","7963880"," We got like 55 minutes left."
"7964140","7965620"," All these bulls are buying this shit."
"7965760","7966340"," I don't believe it. "
"7967600","7969160"," They're doing 75 VPS."
"7969320","7970800"," We just wanted a better positioning cap."
"7972600","7973940"," So we let the bulls take it up here. "
"7974060","7977180"," Now we're going to send it lower into the decision."
"7979320","7980440"," This is what the bears want."
"7982860","7983880"," That's what we are right now. "
"7984120","7985200"," Bears like getting up there."
"7985360","7986980"," He ain't getting here for 1950, buddy."
"7988140","7989460"," So we're going to watch this right here. "
"7989580","7990820"," See how they're trying to push right now?"
"7990820","7992300"," Push, push, push."
"7993200","7994980"," We're going to watch and see these sellers."
"7996300","7998140"," We got some prior supports back here. "
"7998400","7999700"," So we'll keep an eye on this."
"8004640","8005040"," Right?"
"8007280","8009980"," Even though we didn't trade in here, this is the prior support, believe it or not."
"8010640","8011660"," This is a power move up here. "
"8013480","8015920"," Don't use the lube when you say, nope, we're going higher."
"8016220","8017220"," This is a powerful move right here."
"8017660","8017960"," Very powerful. "
"8023460","8026400"," So we're going to see if these bears are here, if we lost our runway."
"8026920","8028000"," Giant sellers up there."
"8028000","8028540"," You see this?"
"8028960","8029440"," Sellers here. "
"8029580","8029920"," Big ones."
"8030740","8031720"," Pretty big sellers here."
"8033940","8034820"," Trying to tell you no. "
"8036460","8037860"," Trying to tell you to take the money and go."
"8039580","8040500"," Take the money and run."
"8044570","8047810"," Let's look and see if we can find where a real support is in the market right now. "
"8048450","8048810"," Whoa."
"8050610","8052030"," No, we're only crazy with it."
"8052210","8052430"," Hold on. "
"8058760","8060340"," Let's see where a real support is."
"8061920","8063640"," I want to make sure we don't get rug pulled in here."
"8065000","8069500"," I don't want to get a rug pull here. "
"8073310","8075390"," So VWAP is pretty much where it's at, right?"
"8075750","8075870"," 416."
"8079570","8081630"," So if you're still long right now, let's talk about that."
"8084160","8086820"," If you're still long right now, if you're like, fuck that cap, I'm staying long. "
"8088960","8090080"," This VWAP right here."
"8091000","8091820"," I'm going to take a look at it."
"8093740","8095120"," So here's VWAP right here, okay?"
"8095680","8100560"," So what you're going to do is pull, if you're long here, if you let some runners on, right, you"
"8100560","8101660"," leave the runners on here. "
"8103280","8106100"," This is going to be, you know, if you wanted to dip by, it's here."
"8108300","8109240"," You want to add to your position."
"8110180","8114980"," If you're a bear, you're looking for a force, a break of this zone here, right?"
"8115420","8115960"," This zone we have. "
"8117040","8117920"," If you're a bear."
"8118160","8120580"," So what you want to be doing is you want to be seeing the trade down."
"8121280","8122180"," Does it matter if it's here?"
"8122400","8123000"," Does it matter if it's here?"
"8123920","8126320"," You want to see the swing high, right?"
"8127260","8128040"," And then a sell down. "
"8128500","8130140"," Or even two is even better."
"8130660","8136320"," What you'll have it up doing is you'll have getting one, two, and then a move down to lower loads."
"8139360","8140360"," How far do we go?"
"8140740","8142260"," Probably today, not lower than 415. "
"8144520","8146260"," Let's do some real panic selling down here."
"8146320","8149960"," I'm taking my money and running and waiting for, because a lot of bulls are like, hey, I made this,"
"8150000","8155480"," made us money here, made a ton of money here, and I'm taking money and waiting for FMC."
"8156000","8157240"," Day traders probably do that as well. "
"8157680","8161660"," So be aware of this as we go down into FMC."
"8161660","8162540"," It's 108."
"8163120","8168600"," We've got only 52 minutes left until the, at least the statement. "
"8169300","8172680"," So you expect some volatility in here heading down."
"8174280","8176300"," But even if we do get this volatility, there could be a chance."
"8176480","8179200"," Let's say your bear flow right now and you're like, oh, shit, then kept my losses. "
"8180000","8181340"," There should be one more chance for you."
"8182780","8184400"," They usually pump at least one more time."
"8186300","8192020"," And then we're expecting and looking into the two o'clock hour for the defense statement, right,"
"8192180","8192520"," for FMC. "
"8193860","8195180"," Nice little push higher here."
"8195420","8196040"," This is beautiful."
"8197620","8201160"," If you're long right here and you want to take your profit, there's a chance we might come back up"
"8201160","8203360"," one more time that you could pull the profit for that trade. "
"8204459","8206799"," Now, also within that, we might trade right through it."
"8207200","8211139"," We have had prior FMCs where literally we go right through it."
"8212879","8213719"," So pick your poison. "
"8215969","8217330"," Bid in the market guaranteed."
"8218370","8223290"," Calls a few days out, catching a bid right now, just premium and a reversal in the market."
"8231629","8233590"," Jenny Marcus is like, I'm not looking. "
"8233850","8238570"," Jenny Marcus is just posting goes, I am not going to look at the zero dates SPX 4200 options."
"8243629","8245629"," He posted that five minutes ago."
"8247170","8248809"," I'm not going to look at the zero dates. "
"8249370","8254590"," I'm going to go to his handle real quick in Rasm and tell him, yes, you are."

"8341299","8342639"," I believe it's a flow of trainers."
"8342840","8347480"," Either a pit trainer or we was a market maker back in the day in Chicago."
"8348139","8354080"," He doesn't talk about it much, but if you ever want to look at like prior swing lows, prior highs,"
"8354559","8360700"," month lows, month highs, end of month stuff, real price of the Spy SPX. "
"8362180","8366320"," That guy is like a numbers machine in his brain and just pumps him out."
"8371240","8375200"," He just posted I'm not going to look at 0-8 SPX 4200 options."
"8381690","8391990"," Oh shit, trained down here, where are stops for bulls, they are somewhere down here, stops are"
"8391990","8399410"," somewhere in this vicinity here, 4.15 down here below, 4.16 some stops for bulls. "
"8400710","8404650"," I'm over there, I'm over there shit posted on Jenny Marcus's Twitter handle right now."
"8406430","8408350"," So we'll see if they're going to rug pull us here."
"8408350","8410870"," They're not rug pulling here, you know what, you guys will see it right here, okay?"
"8411410","8416990"," 4.15.41, what are you going to be looking for here as we head to FOMC meeting, or to"
"8416990","8424370"," the presser, as you want to look for our basically fake bids leading us lower. "
"8424790","8430590"," So we had a support at 4.16 and you can see right now they've lowered their bid."
"8432050","8436890"," So the bid is at 4.15.25 now, if you start to see bids coming in at 4.14,"
"8436910","8444370"," this blue area, start leading lower, what it is, is it's basically people in the market putting a"
"8444370","8448550"," bid in lower, like I can ram, if I'm a bank, or hedge fund, I can ram in like I'll"
"8448550","8457210"," buy at 4.14.50 and then I pull the order, right, and the price will lead down to that"
"8457210","8464290"," price, as I'm shorting, as I'm laying on some puts, and then they'll pull that order as we get"
"8464290","8466830"," closer, and they're trying to lead the price down here."
"8471740","8483550"," So currently that price is 4.15.37, 4.14.68, see that"
"8483550","8491600"," nice little larger triangle, large triangle, right there. "
"8492900","8496780"," So 4.14, somewhere down in here, you can see it right down in this zone down here."
"8498020","8500760"," This is where the bulls and the bears are battling now, right?"
"8506510","8510650"," We know this is light resistance, this is now support down in here, we want to maintain this"
"8510650","8511350"," support, right?"
"8513780","8518800"," So I'll probably be looking for, I'm going to be looking for a squeeze higher of course, and then"
"8518800","8521720"," something down like this, and then I dip by hopefully to take a pyre."
"8525380","8529520"," So if you are a long, if you were a long pup here and got caught, you probably have another,"
"8530320","8535000"," another, at least one more pump, usually have a more pump. "
"8539000","8550470"," We'll call this light support, change this to a light support, good enough"
"8550470","8550810"," for me."
"8556050","8559330"," We'll fill in the trash for you, you don't need to see that,"
"8559630","8567590"," see"
"8569730","8582120"," it here,"
"8582700","8597140"," sellers above at 4.17, 60, 4.17, 70, not too strong, fires are in charge here, now"
"8597140","8599460"," they are strong, they're strong for you."
"8639560","8645720"," Some puts coming into the market right now, bears, lighting them up right, this is where bear, you"
"8645720","8648340"," probably see some big bears out there saying they're good, they're going short here. "
"8648740","8658200"," You get spy puts, 5, 9, 408 p, 136,000 dollars, spy puts, 5, 9, 408 p, 217,000 dollars,"
"8658540","8674140"," small money though, queues, 5, 4, 313, P for $50,000, IWM puts, $62,000, not big money, put"
"8674140","8681920"," call ratio sent to it right now, put the calls, 0.5, 0.59, we have a neutral bearing in"
"8681920","8692140"," the market right now, 67%, put flow 137,000 to 230,000 on the call side, short"
"8692140","8695840"," covering then would be the regime that just took place in the market right now."
"8710170","8716690"," We should get, we normally get, just the heads up here are tuning in right now, two programming"
"8716690","8723890"," notes that you want to pay attention to today, and that is if you are, if this stream is lagging"
"8723890","8728690"," for you in any way, shape or form, you can go down to YouTube in the bottom right hand side"
"8728690","8734690"," there on your settings and you can speed up the broadcast so that it's real time, I'll sound kind"
"8734690","8740650"," of funny and stream like I'm speaking really fast, and then after about 15 seconds, I will catch up"
"8740650","8749870"," to you by just a few seconds, YouTube puts a natural buffer on your side of the stream and they"
"8749870","8756610"," will, they will slow, they will slow down the broadcast to you, they'll, they'll limit it by like"
"8756610","8762310"," 15 seconds, but you can actually get real time in the stream here, a little bit of a role taking"
"8762310","8772190"," place right now, sellers coming in, profit takers, call sellers, put buyers, you can see them"
"8772190","8773170"," leaning in right now."
"8774470","8783930"," Real buyers down below at this 41450 level, but you can speed up the broadcast so that you're live"
"8783930","8790830"," as we go, and the reason I'm saying that to you today is because typically trade the news will get"
"8790830","8796450"," the Fed, or any, our pertinent information like this, they'll get it off a Bloomberg terminal and"
"8796450","8797090"," immediately read it. "
"8797730","8802410"," So we'll hear it before it hits, let's say, Walter Bloomberg on Twitter, typically."
"8803830","8809730"," They will usually give a slant to the news as well, their take is it bullish, bearish or neutral,"
"8810590","8814630"," so we can usually get it really fast, we'll get it just an answer, is it bullish or is it"
"8814630","8821010"," hawkish, is davis, is it neutral, before it hits Twitter, so it's usually like anywhere from, not"
"8821010","8827650"," always, sometimes they miss, they won't get the information quick enough, but oftentimes in days"
"8827650","8832270"," like today, they will get and be able to interpret before you get the news on Twitter."
"8833650","8839510"," And you'll hear it here on our broadcast, that 2 p.m., they'll get the information and they'll try"
"8839510","8849300"," to condense it real fast, I want you to pay attention up here, these sellers then down below"
"8849300","8856720"," this white band down here, right, 415, 23, some support growing down here, it's not quite as low as"
"8856720","8858380"," 414 now, it's even higher, it's right at VWAP. "
"8858900","8862060"," So keep your eyes on the VWAP here for real support."
"8863380","8869820"," So and just on the back of that topic, you should hear trade the news come out today and give,"
"8870060","8875960"," give their idea of what actually is taking place from the Fed, right?"
"8876460","8882260"," So hopefully we get that information before the market does, you should have a reaction or be able"
"8882260","8885320"," to have a reaction to the market before it actually happens in your candlestick charts."
"8886040","8890820"," Usually it's about a five to 10 or 15 second reaction. "
"8892000","8897800"," So if you line, if you're long this market, you can line up a cell to sell your shit if"
"8897800","8899800"," you need to before the market goes down."
"8900780","8907660"," If you're short this market, you can line up a cell being short and just be ready to trigger if"
"8907660","8911220"," it doesn't go your way or stay in the trade if it goes your way, make sense?"
"8912720","8916740"," So hopefully we'll get that information before most of your other outlets out there."
"8917500","8922040"," We do normally do, at least on my end, I usually get them, important things like this I'll"
"8922040","8929040"," typically get before I see it anywhere, anywhere on YouTube, anywhere on Twitter, unless you have a"
"8929040","8933420"," Bloomberg terminal and you're right there and you can interpret it as fast as those guys can. "
"8933540","8934760"," They're bad ass at that stuff."
"8935920","8941320"," We've had many, many news stories break from trade the news that have beaten everybody else."
"8942120","8945520"," It's not cheap, trade the news cost me $350 a month or something. "
"8945780","8954180"," It is no joke, no joke, the price for trade the news and it's usually for key moments like this."
"8956360","8960800"," So if they do their job today and they can get the information to us before everybody else, you"
"8960800","8967500"," might have an edge on the retail trader sticking around with us today into the two o'clock hour."
"8968260","8969560"," Remember, it's a free sub too. "
"8970620","8976340"," Go back to the sub to pay for the subscription to pay for, ask your guy or your girl or"
"8976340","8977680"," whatever if she's got that for you."
"8981100","8987440"," I'm going to go with probably not right down there and be up some decent support fires right on be"
"8987440","8988060"," up right now."
"8989900","8994100"," So if you're trading and you're not, if you're trading, you know, you're not paying attention to"
"8994100","8998960"," the broadcast, at least turn the volume up as we head into, tell your friends, go on social media. "
"9001450","9004490"," If you got the traders that you like out there, just be like, hey, even if you don't like this"
"9004490","9008830"," guy, just put them on the background so you can listen to trade the news."
"9008830","9011550"," That way, you know, he might have it quicker than other people."
"9013030","9022840"," These events I usually do the split seconds so you can make a move as that"
"9022840","9023680"," news comes out. "
"9025980","9027480"," The important part, right?"
"9027700","9029760"," I guess I should tell you guys about that."
"9030320","9032780"," Importance of this as we come into this two o'clock hour."
"9041370","9046190"," Yeah, yeah, I'll tell you what, like the important ones, like the important shit that comes out,"
"9048080","9055320"," yeah, all this action is all this action is common in FMC days or FMC days. "
"9055720","9060700"," Not minutes, but on meeting days, as a matter of fact, you should be fading the minutes."
"9061420","9068220"," So if you want another date to throw on your charts, another point of interest, FMC minutes that"
"9068220","9074360"," we'll trade into them higher and then we'll sell the market on FMC minutes day."
"9076160","9079200"," I'll go out there and tell your friends because this is important, right?"
"9079480","9086340"," And we're trade the news shines usually is on these kind of breaking news stories. "
"9087140","9089800"," They know that like the Tesla report is important."
"9090220","9092540"," They know that Apple reporting is important."
"9092920","9099320"," They know that FMC press or the press, not the presser, but the statement is important. "
"9100540","9103740"," Yeah, this is the longest and oldest news squad that's still around."
"9104300","9106460"," I'm not, I have no way affiliated with them."
"9106460","9107460"," I don't get any affiliate link. "
"9107620","9111240"," I think I might have affiliate link down there to them, but you guys, you guys are getting it for"
"9111240","9111520"," free."
"9111560","9118620"," So you don't have to pay for it, but they are very good usually on these events of breaking"
"9119080","9119460"," confirmed."
"9119880","9124380"," You know, the key part is to it's breaking confirmed news that impact the market that's to put that"
"9124380","9125220"," key point in there. "
"9126500","9130720"," Sometimes they will break a store, they won't, you'll have a story first, but it's not impacting"
"9130720","9131260"," the market."
"9131460","9133880"," They will break it when it impacts the market, when it's important."
"9134900","9138120"," That's another key sometimes people will be like, well, they don't break everything that you"
"9138120","9138500"," already know. "
"9138500","9144220"," And it's like, yeah, but they break it when it's important, when it matters, and that's the key"
"9144220","9144520"," point."
"9145940","9147500"," When does it matter to the market?"
"9150320","9159120"," The seller is retreating a little bit up here for $4, $19.50, the bull saying, fuck you, we're in."
"9159820","9163040"," The bulls are like, nope, we're in, we're, we're, we're, we're vested. "
"9164640","9166540"," Our calls cost us cheap nothing this morning."
"9168120","9169460"," We'll, we'll diamond handed here."
"9172000","9177080"," So you're friends, though, on Twitter, on YouTube, on wherever your, your social media is dank"

"9193960","9202690"," on or air muffs on, tell your husbands to go back to doing the dishes"
"9202690","9204650"," while you're trading."

"9373820","9376240"," Where do we trade down to on those calls this morning?"
"9377780","9379560"," Just under 60 cents, right?"
"9380780","9384700"," Start our dog cost averaging into those calls, anything 60 cents in below."
"9386060","9387680"," Where do those calls go to today?"
"9399810","9402490"," Only buying the depths of hell and fading every other trade."

"9447170","9452590"," We know the last support is down below here at 416ish on VWOP, right?"
"9452790","9453890"," Nice place to buy a dip."
"9455310","9456250"," Should have some weakness."
"9456250","9457930"," 130 PM here, right?"

"9471420","9473560"," We said 420 is probably top today. "
"9474260","9478860"," We also said that in a good report that we probably have 430 on tap for tomorrow or Friday."
"9480180","9485300"," We also said that if you didn't do zero dates, it's probably better to buy some Friday calls rather"
"9485300","9486160"," than zero dates."
"9486160","9488360"," I said, you guys said some of you guys could buy zero dates. "
"9489120","9491780"," I said the safe ways to buy Friday calls."
"9492680","9500600"," We talked about where the top has come down from 440 and 450 reaching for 450 down to 430 and"
"9500600","9502240"," 420 in the meantime."
"9503720","9512660"," It is interesting though that we've traded a 420 because this will also push up the volatility"
"9512660","9512820"," trigger. "
"9514860","9515560"," Intraday it will."
"9517580","9519160"," We're trading up here right now."
"9519400","9523900"," What is the trade for me at least that I'm looking for?"
"9525140","9528820"," I'm looking for some volatility heading into the two o'clock hour. "
"9528920","9529320"," It's now 131."
"9529720","9530980"," We've got 29 minutes left."
"9533120","9540620"," I'd like to see that weakness just heading in down here and one more dip grab to grab. "
"9541880","9542980"," That's what I'm looking for."
"9543120","9544460"," I'm looking for that dip that dip buy."
"9545840","9547540"," With that said, I might miss it, right?"
"9548860","9555420"," I've seen FMCs just keep going higher, believe it or not, but I'm looking for that dip buy that's"
"9555420","9557120"," snap down, snap down, right?"
"9558580","9559400"," That panic. "
"9561800","9563380"," What we're here for is that panic."
"9568440","9570280"," Watching some calls on SPX."
"9570280","9580040"," This is probably, I bet this is Jedi Marcus, SPX, May 6th,"
"9580080","9585360"," 4300C, $1.3 million. "
"9587700","9588800"," That's the trade, right?"
"9589000","9591420"," I called that trade out this morning, right, before you even opened the market."
"9593180","9601320"," I said, look for these calls at a specific price and I said, start averaging into them."
"9601320","9602700"," They just came through right now. "
"9603280","9606940"," Someone smarter than me just placed that bet for $1.3 million."
"9610830","9612190"," Start placing your bets."
"9617240","9619760"," I'm going to line up my bets here. "
"9628390","9637970"," I'm going to line up some bets, 133 in the afternoon, 27"

"9658180","9662460"," Jedi Marcus is now talking about bids being in the market to provide liquidity."
"9668160","9669400"," What do you think happens here?"
"9669540","9675060"," Does this hold or does this come down, right?"
"9675660","9679780"," Just be aware down here, you want to be watching for this, you want to watch these bids here stay"
"9679780","9680320"," in the market. "
"9682990","9687010"," We're going to keep our eye on this right here as we head into 2PM."
"9689250","9693430"," If we see the V-rop line here, we see this 4, 16, 79."
"9694010","9698050"," If there is any panic, you'll see this go away, it'll turn black and we'll start falling, free"
"9698050","9698690"," falling down here. "
"9698830","9699470"," I don't think that we do."
"9702100","9704220"," But if we do, we'll be a dip buy down below."
"9704220","9712470"," We know we've got 412 sitting down here, 410, 405,"
"9713830","9719790"," 400's down to the FOMC rate decision of previews on the platform. "
"9722640","9726240"," I'm going to turn up the volume on trade the news, I know it's going to be a little annoying,"
"9726660","9728420"," but we want to hear it crystal clear out there."
"9730240","9734920"," I'm going to read you something briefly here, the FOMC interest rate decision is at 2PM."
"9735780","9741660"," The chairman's press conference is at 2.30PM. Today's FOMC meeting comes after the central bank,"
"9742000","9743500"," let me bring you back to the normal here. "
"9752990","9758270"," Today's FOMC meeting comes after the central bank announced rate lift off and marks with a 25 DPS"
"9758270","9762250"," hike and confirm plans to start reducing its balance fee."
"9763010","9768450"," The Fed is expected to get more aggressive with rate hikes today and over the next several meetings"
"9768450","9775410"," as it seeks to burnish its inflation fighting credentials by getting rates up to at least neutral"
"9775410","9776510"," by year end."
"9778150","9783430"," Another 50 DPS hike is expected today, a move that has been telegraphed by the Fed ahead of time. "
"9785330","9789570"," FOMC committee members have also indicated that they will announce the finalized plan for the"
"9789570","9796470"," balance sheet reduction today, though the runoff is not expected to be activated until June."
"9797290","9804670"," The supporting documents will describe a fairly swift ramp-up of the reduction plan to the $95"
"9804670","9811410"," billion redemption cap, with increments perhaps starting at $30 billion in June, right that down,"
"9811930","9820830"," $30 billion in June, jumping to $60 billion in July and reaching a full $95 billion in August,"
"9821730","9825250"," right that down, post that on Twitter, nobody's posted that, right?"
"9825250","9827270"," They only say $95 billion, $95 billion."
"9828010","9835390"," Go post that on Twitter, $30 billion in June, $60 billion in July, $95 billion in August. "
"9836730","9837830"," Ready for the rest of it?"
"9837990","9839490"," This is the part that I'm wondering about."
"9839870","9841590"," This is the part that my question is."
"9841770","9845110"," This is where I think you get the bull trade on today. "
"9846330","9852850"," And then $60 billion of treasuries, $35 billion of MBS per month."
"9853550","9862110"," Now, those are the two keys that you want to be listening into today, because there are some in the"
"9862110","9866890"," mortgage-backed security market and the treasury market that are saying they can't do that."
"9869070","9874890"," They have to continue to provide the liquidity to both the credit market and the mortgage-backed"
"9874890","9875890"," security market. "
"9877290","9882170"," So that is one place that you want to be paying attention to into the 2PM hour."
"9883370","9893110"," Is, in the details, are they going to start to key on treasuries and mortgage-backed"
"9893110","9893570"," securities?"
"9894470","9899610"," And the two numbers you want to be paying attention to are $60 billion and $35 billion per month."
"9901250","9905130"," Respectively, $60 billion in treasuries, $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities. "
"9906090","9907410"," Those are some key words for you."
"9907550","9908590"," You don't have to understand all of it."
"9908650","9909490"," Those are just key words. "
"9914780","9916420"," A little bit of weakness now in the spy."
"9916920","9920120"," You can start to see some of the support going away."
"9920480","9923000"," It's starting to turn a little bit of light bluish in here, a little bit of panic. "
"9923500","9924740"," Not too much, but some in there."
"9926740","9929760"," Look for a dip buy down below $4.49 if you're bullish."
"9933260","9940420"," That's some of the keys here, as we'll look over here, take a look down here, start extending some"
"9940420","9940640"," of these. "
"9943700","9945620"," That's $4.15.32 down there."
"9949640","9951260"," Start cleaning this stuff up down here."
"9951300","9952080"," We can just get rid of this. "
"9954280","9957780"," We already know that down below $4, we got $4.12 right here, okay?"
"9958020","9959360"," Start breaking this down over here."
"9960040","9963380"," If you start breaking this down, nice to be part, how are you?"
"9966960","9968000"," No, thank you, Lovey."
"9968700","9969520"," I appreciate it. "
"9973810","9978250"," Sorry, I have a home school and I've got a daughter asking me if I'd like a ham and cheese"
"9978250","9978610"," sandwich."
"9979910","9980590"," She's the best."
"9981790","9983170"," I'm going to get rid of this over here. "
"9992020","9994340"," We lost the runway on that one right there, right?"
"9995060","9997360"," This is key resistance up here, right?"
"9997500","9998300"," There's another point though."
"9998480","10000960"," If we break above $4.21, we are running."
"10001340","10002020"," I promise you that. "
"10002480","10005380"," Even on good news, we get a dovish fed, nuff, dovish fed."
"10005980","10007280"," We break above $4.20 up here."
"10007900","10012120"," You will see a blast off to $4.30, even with not many puts rolling off the market. "
"10012380","10013900"," You'll see what's called real money buying."
"10025060","10026220"," Sorry, I'm looking at some of this stuff."
"10028260","10030120"," Let me just say I'm going to take a quick five minute break. "
"10030680","10032280"," It's $1.39. I'm going to take a quick five minute break."
"10032380","10034360"," I'm going to, you'll still see me on screen here."
"10034380","10035400"," I've got to check out a couple of things. "
"10044430","10048190"," Can we just, I need a two minute break real quick, probably in five minutes that most."
"10048510","10049110"," Stay with me here."
"10049670","10050750"," I'll still be talking to you. "
"10051310","10052310"," Let me have a couple seconds here."
"10052390","10054430"," I'm going to turn around and get some coffee and I'll be right back."
"10144020","10145520"," Wow, we got a lot of viewers today. "
"10146180","10146540"," Unreal."
"10148600","10150820"," Everyone's tuning in and everyone wants to know we're going winky."
"10151860","10153740"," Everyone wants to know what's up today. "
"10154100","10155140"," Okay, so we're going to talk about this."
"10155300","10159720"," We've got almost 15 minutes left until the Fed's decision."
"10160700","10164940"," I did read you a summary of what to expect out of this decision today. "
"10165000","10166040"," I'm going to read it to you one more time."
"10166860","10167900"," Maybe you're just joining us."
"10169660","10174480"," The FMC meeting comes after the central bank announced rate lift off in March for the 25 VPS hike"
"10174480","10177220"," and confirmed plans to start reducing its balance sheet. "
"10177720","10181780"," The Fed is expected to get more aggressive with rate hikes today and over the next several meetings"

"10235390","10244770"," billion redemption cap with increments, perhaps, perhaps, so that would be expectations, right?"
"10246810","10248850"," Perhaps starting at 30 billion in June."
"10249130","10250230"," Write that on a piece of paper or something. "
"10250470","10253890"," No pad on your computer because you're going to be listening to this information as it comes out"

"10287840","10289120"," Those are the ones I want to hear."
"10290600","10295620"," Now, on top of all that, right, to the press conference, notably Powell will be hosting his first"
"10295620","10298060"," in-person press conference since the start of the pandemic."
"10298560","10300280"," Reporters will likely press the chairman. "
"10300780","10301980"," Remember this key point."
"10302200","10305000"," We talked about this, right, repetitively for the past week."
"10310240","10312620"," Well, let's see if we can find, make sure we still have the support here. "
"10312800","10314000"," That's not going away right there."
"10317030","10317590"," This is key."
"10319730","10325010"," Reporters will likely press the chairman about cadence of rate heights for the rest of the year,"
"10326430","10331410"," and on whether any tea leaves of easing inflation might alter the course that the Fed has laid out"
"10331410","10331830"," for rates. "
"10332890","10339750"," It's unlikely that they'll be able to nail him down on whether one or more additional 50 BPS rate"

"10360430","10368210"," This morning, we got news that GDP forecasts are going up, not down. "
"10371620","10372760"," And here's the insight."
"10373800","10379560"," The last 50 BPS rate hike by the Fed was in the year 2000, and this would be the first"
"10379560","10386380"," time since the year 2006 that the Fed raises rates at two consecutive meetings."
"10395620","10405980"," And you know that at the world economic symposium, hold on a second, sir, I'm"
"10405980","10409640"," trying to line up a trade that he was really bearish there. "

"10419540","10421080"," I don't care if GDP is going up."
"10421960","10427360"," So we already know that they do that when they, at least QE upon us, we already know that they're"
"10427360","10429540"," going to put too much on, right?"
"10430440","10433960"," They're like a hammer on a thumbtack, not a hammer on a nail, hammer on a thumbtack. "
"10434080","10434700"," They do too much."
"10435840","10443880"," Watching puts come across on Apple, Tesla and video spy, anticipating weakness into the FOMC in the"
"10443880","10444380"," next few minutes."
"10446300","10449180"," You're going to probably hear it before you hear it on Twitter. "
"10449400","10450480"," You might hear it on Twitter first."
"10450560","10456640"," I would have open Walter Bloomberg or something, but you'll hear the critical information here from"
"10456640","10457200"," trade the news."
"10457460","10458120"," They're usually faster. "
"10458800","10464860"," They're known for these kind of events being faster, but they usually have a quick take on is it"
"10464860","10471660"," hawkish, is it dovish, the implications of the market as we trade higher here."
"10472120","10474000"," The market is catching a bid right now."
"10479720","10481520"," You may be wondering what I'm looking for here, right?"
"10481660","10484840"," We have some nice, nice bulls buying here, buying here. "
"10485160","10489060"," We know the top supposedly is $4.20. This would squeeze the market higher."
"10489860","10491640"," We're in this kind of a bull flag here."
"10492020","10496600"," I'm looking for some kind of a weakness down here to buy, and if we can get this news quick"
"10496600","10499580"," enough and we can get a quick bounce below, I'll take this long here. "
"10501650","10507630"," What I'm looking at is $4.30 for Friday for the sixth, and they were a great buy down here,"
"10507950","10512050"," and hopefully there's going to be some more weakness that I can buy them again for a nice cheap"

"10516220","10517300"," We're waiting to see here."
"10517420","10518780"," This is a little bit of resistance here. "
"10519140","10523320"," This little line right here, this is going back from yesterday, you want to see, right?"
"10523980","10524380"," Nice."

"10535260","10536980"," We could ram it up here and then reverse."
"10536980","10541100"," So maybe you take your money and run on the first rip higher. "
"10541880","10546300"," If you're long from down below here, I would take some money here and then jump back in above."
"10548200","10550660"," So remember everything that I teach you guys every day, right?"
"10550760","10552100"," We talk about this every single day here."
"10552860","10557300"," So if we do trade, so you get a great report, right?"
"10557460","10558540"," We should be blast off higher. "
"10559580","10562600"," Take your money and run, wait for the next plug to go higher."
"10563660","10564180"," Take your money and run."
