"319280","319840"," Good morning, Jonathan. "
"320040","320600"," John Hagerty."

"322400","323920"," Yeah, no, I was up at four."
"324120","324540"," This is more 330. "
"324840","325620"," I think I was up 334."
"326880","330140"," It's just hard for me right now to be getting here exactly on time."
"330300","331520"," I had to get some coffee this morning. "
"334160","336280"," And let me work on my mic."
"337600","338440"," I had to get some coffee."
"338920","341500"," I was talking to my youngest daughter. "
"344500","347720"," She had some time off from, I think I have to clean my glasses."
"358050","358650"," But I'm fine."
"358890","359190"," I'm fine. "
"359430","359930"," I'm up every morning."
"360070","360670"," I actually got a bed."
"361450","367090"," Quite early and quite early unless someone, unless someone wants to week me up the middle of the"
"367090","372110"," night to do some night drink and some some fin tip fin to it personalities will sometimes wake me"
"372110","372330"," up. "
"373190","376390"," Okay, so I did post on fin to it this morning."
"377270","380810"," Some information and fin to it this morning."
"380910","382290"," Okay, so we're just going to take a quick look here. "
"383870","386770"," We're losing a little bit of momentum this morning."
"388010","390470"," We got a reaction earlier this morning."
"390470","391130"," Not quite. "
"393070","397510"," We got a reaction right down here at this was the previous low."
"399770","401990"," Or excuse me, we tagged this right here."
"402250","402890"," What time was it?"
"403950","404470"," 939. "
"404830","405070"," We tagged."
"405570","408910"," We're getting close down to this hourly trigger down below."
"408910","412210"," No, I don't like seeing typically I don't like seeing. "
"413730","419470"," I like seeing this reaction here, but the fact that we didn't hold the one minute and the five"
"419470","421130"," minute I'll draw these in for you."
"423450","425090"," I'll draw these in for you this morning."
"428750","430410"," So we have a five minute here. "
"433550","435510"," This is the green line that's above here."
"436690","438570"," And we have a one minute below."
"441700","444320"," So what we'll do is we'll talk about that. "
"445500","446760"," This morning, so."
"447880","450660"," And right here we've got that's the little green line that's right there."
"451260","456080"," And we have this hourly right here typically right off this hourly you want to see. "
"456140","459500"," So I'll leave this up here because I want to show you what I'm talking about here."
"460140","461660"," And this is an hourly right here."
"464260","469080"," So what you want to be seeing when we come in here is. "
"470420","473340"," Kind of a violent reaction you want to see."
"473940","475460"," A move higher right."
"476640","481960"," And you want to get underneath the five minute and have the one minute come up. "
"482680","487440"," And then kind of have this blast off right so that you're now above the one minute."
"487440","488780"," So you'd want to see like."
"489760","492900"," This rotate down this rotate up. "
"493750","499420"," Right this one five minutes underneath and then the hourly kind of come up and push you higher."
"499760","501600"," If you're a bull okay."
"502540","508380"," And so if you had another one that would be price right so we'll write price here. "
"511260","513440"," And think about it like this okay."
"516159","521360"," If you have the one minute right and you'll see the price switch between the one minute the daily"
"521360","524000"," or the hourly the daily the weekly the monthly."
"524000","527900"," And you'll see price kind of slipping between each one of these okay. "
"529160","534740"," Meanwhile you'll also see as the price moves does it dance right."
"535600","538440"," You can have a daily well actually we'll draw them in so."
"542520","543520"," You got daily. "
"547020","549100"," Okay and then you've got a weekly."
"550080","555140"," And then you've got a monthly."
"559500","565560"," Right basically one minute five minute hourly daily weekly and monthly momentum. "
"568120","575260"," Now these these these momentum can can turn right you can get the hourly above the five minute it"
"575260","577680"," can go below the daily blow the weekly blow the monthly."
"578160","584340"," So these can do a dance as well and they infer different things when they get close together like"
"584340","587400"," you see an hourly in a minute you'll tend to get a reaction."
"587400","595300"," Right you want to see the monthly over time raise up right in past weekly and daily you want to"
"595300","598820"," see weekly come over monthly at some point right push the hourly up. "
"599320","605520"," Right you want to see price move up the same time get above the one minute very bullish right."
"606180","611160"," You'll start to see momentum weekend and the weekly will come down monthly will come down."
"611160","614960"," The early come down and you'll see price kind of following okay. "
"615900","621460"," So you'll see this like a base on a basic way you'll see price bounce between these things so just"
"621460","622340"," looking right now."
"623120","627260"," You can see that the five minute is above the one minute okay."
"627680","629320"," We want to see the one minute above five minute. "
"629560","633660"," We want to see the price above the one minute before we take along here."
"633660","635980"," So that setup is not here yet right."
"636380","637860"," We're not seeing that this morning. "
"638500","641740"," So if you ask me hey I'm going to take a long here my answer to you is no."
"642460","648960"," You can also see that we tested down below on the hourly trigger and we didn't get a big reaction"
"648960","652520"," we got a reaction here at 941 it was like oh hell no we squeezed higher."
"653160","655520"," But we're coming back down to test the second time. "
"656040","658040"," So I'm just sitting here waiting at this point."
"658700","660120"," For this one minute."
"660540","666740"," This green line right here to switch above and for price to follow and hold above to take along. "
"666740","668540"," Does that make sense here sorry."
"670340","672200"," Now hourly is strong right here."
"673120","678320"," But do you see do you see how you have this like marching up over the hourly. "
"679960","684700"," Right momentum right don't don't we're marching don't don't and then all of a sudden you see it"
"684700","686680"," kind of flatten out a little bit right here right."
"686680","687600"," It's kind of chilling."
"688980","694480"," So that's not giving you an indication at this point that we're going higher either right kind of"
"694480","699200"," like kind of like showing here in a simple way just to cut like a crayon like a marine does. "
"699700","701680"," It's showing you that we're kind of flat lining."
"701700","706520"," So you want to see like the hourly start to match March up you're looking if you're a bull that's"
"706520","708960"," what you're looking for you looking for this hourly to start marching up."
"709420","714560"," You're looking for price to break above the five minute and the one minute momentum trigger. "
"715320","717300"," Right starting to happen right now."
"717380","724860"," And then I'm also wanting I'm also wanting this one minute trigger here to come above the five"
"724860","725400"," minute trigger."
"726000","729400"," Right we'll change the color there we want to see that come up come above. "
"729800","735340"," And then we want to see we also want to see price leading this right."
"736420","740440"," Price leading this and then we want to see the hourly trigger cut above."
"740440","745080"," Right so until we get that I'm not doing nothing this morning I'm not jumping into a trade. "
"745600","749820"," You know you can see we're in we're in a trend and what this is one other thing about this"
"749820","751920"," morning that's crucial for you as a trader."
"752860","754560"," Absolutely crucial is this."
"757300","759320"," You know when we're in trend day right. "
"760240","765940"," You know when we're in trend day we got a cluster right when we slam higher right we don't get"
"765940","768280"," rejected here and we're off and running right."
"768280","770800"," It's a blast off moment where we're moving."
"771380","777960"," And so you're kind of looking not only for that this morning but you're looking for the market. "
"778520","780780"," You see how we're kind of just fucking around here."
"781280","785840"," This morning it's not that we can't go up here and just looking at this on a regular chart."
"787560","794320"," This is a kind of a close representation of what you're seeing on this other chart so just looking"
"794320","794880"," right here. "
"796900","798580"," This is a one minute chart right."
"800660","805620"," We'll bring over this is pivot I post these every morning on Captain's Alpha the levels."
"806200","809220"," You can get them and plug them into your own charting software. "
"809920","812560"," You can they're on an Excel sheet you can more than likely."
"813140","819700"," I have a have some coding done for Python to slam them into a trading view."
"821220","824580"," So we're almost there we can just cut and paste them into your chart every day. "
"825560","827740"," But my point to you is this is that."
"829380","831500"," See this little blue line right here right."
"833100","836100"," You want to start to see this trade higher you want to see. "
"837660","843580"," I'm going to start to see you know this green line coming up and then this blue line coming up."
"845340","845820"," Right."
"851800","853320"," And you want to see. "
"854440","857300"," I guess we'll use our under some."
"858660","861500"," You want to see this start trading up higher right."
"862360","866840"," Yesterday you knew when we stayed above the blue line the bulls were in charge right. "
"867680","872460"," And you see this green line stand underneath there so until we see that what do you do you don't"
"872460","874100"," do anything you just kind of fuck off until."
"874100","880760"," Until it begins to happen it's already 10 10 14 in the morning."
"881760","884160"," And bulls can't say they're in charge right. "
"884340","887380"," You can look in previous time let's look in previous time here."
"889720","892620"," You see that you see that like blue over green line."
"893100","896180"," See how there's a fight here between bulls and bears. "
"897080","900340"," Bulls win and they're off and running right."
"900820","904640"," On that blue line come back and check the green line off and running right."
"905760","910940"," Come back and check the green line fail get underneath it and then we're in a down trend for a"
"910940","911600"," little while right. "
"913000","918380"," Come back to up the check pulls when it back and they take it right into the close so just"
"918380","919540"," right here this morning."
"921500","923180"," What do you want to see right."
"925000","932000"," You want to see us get above this blue line here and this blue curling line to follow right. "
"932660","937980"," You want to see this blue line get above right here for continuation for the bulls."
"939360","942060"," You want to see this blue line come up right here."
"942920","946520"," You're going to be looking for a pullback here. "
"947900","952680"," A retest you'll end up seeing a retest of the blue line and then continuation."
"953000","954820"," This is where the meat of the trade is right here."
"955840","958980"," If you're bullish you don't just go buying fucking bullshit in here. "
"959560","961280"," You've got a previous high right here."
"961520","965360"," You want to wait for it to come back a little bit and look for some continuation."
"965860","967020"," This is where the money is right here. "
"969180","969740"," Make sense."
"971060","976040"," And we're going to take a look back on yesterday and we're going to snap a line."
"976040","977940"," We're going to snap a line on previous high. "
"979920","982160"," 40264 we know where that's where the bears are."
"983360","985180"," We know that's what they're defending this morning."
"986360","990660"," We know if we reject new highs today that we're looking for previous low. "
"991240","996840"," We can see yesterday's previous low is right here so we'll tag these first two right here right."
"997060","998040"," Previous low right there."
"999000","1000720"," We have another one back here. "
"1001000","1003740"," We got another previous low back here in case we start selling."
"1004820","1005880"," Snag one right there."
"1006300","1008880"," We got a couple of previous lows here here and here. "
"1009460","1011460"," We got a little bit of a gap to fill down below here."
"1013260","1015800"," And so we know where we are right."
"1016000","1017580"," We know where previous lows are. "
"1017720","1018760"," Previous highs are."
"1020080","1022540"," You got people out there saying we're going to be an inside day."
"1023460","1025880"," I don't doubt that this morning. "
"1028240","1029880"," You want to do a day trade or something."
"1030720","1035920"," You want to day trade this inside day."
"1036460","1038099"," When someone says inside day. "
"1038859","1043060"," They're saying we're going to trade inside of the previous side of the day before and the previous"
"1043060","1044079"," low from the day before."
"1044720","1047180"," Kind of people tend to call it a decision candle."
"1048420","1050500"," That's not really my take on it. "
"1050640","1051100"," That's a decision."
"1051380","1056560"," That's more gathering up some steam to make a move higher or lower or in a larger context."
"1057800","1062680"," So I'm still looking for this blue line to get above here. "
"1063760","1066060"," I want to see some momentum come up on top here."
"1067380","1070920"," The hourly is starting to creep up on the background here."
"1071040","1071900"," So that's good for bulls. "
"1073740","1075740"," We might get a slow grind up today."
"1076060","1076400"," Possible."
"1077260","1078560"," We can get a slow grind up today. "
"1079760","1083140"," Price target remains the same as yesterday that four zero three."
"1083700","1086300"," I believe it's four four zero three sixty three."
"1087960","1090960"," And then we've got some other price targets if you want to take a look. "
"1094240","1095000"," We've got."
"1097560","1100280"," Four zero three sixty three and shocker."
"1101200","1103260"," It was our two today or two. "
"1103940","1108460"," It's our one today for four zero three sixty three is actually today is our one."
"1109040","1111920"," We were looking for that target yesterday and didn't reach it."
"1112560","1117320"," Above we have four zero six sixty and then we have four ten fifty one. "
"1118100","1125000"," I think I posted on on fin to it yesterday four zero three and then four ten and then four"
"1125000","1125380"," twenty."
"1126780","1133500"," So I'd like to see four zero three get tagged a pullback for a retest and then up to four"
"1133500","1134220"," ten would be nice."
"1135080","1136260"," Four ten fifty one. "
"1136260","1141950"," And we're not getting much momentum today, right?"
"1142150","1146190"," You see that a little bit of selling here two big red bars a little bit of selling."
"1150810","1154010"," Seeing some of the hourly trigger kind of falter a little bit."
"1155330","1158430"," If this hourly trigger does falter some more. "
"1159050","1160050"," I don't like seeing this."
"1162990","1164870"," This faltering in the early trigger."
"1165050","1171810"," If this does falter you're looking for three ninety three ninety three sixty nine. "
"1173410","1175430"," Three ninety three sixty nine."
"1175770","1177930"," So any three sixty nine."
"1179890","1183790"," You'll you'll put this in here three sixty nine. "
"1186190","1187670"," Right here."
"1190350","1191690"," You can see it."
"1192590","1194150"," There's a price target down below. "
"1196690","1199110"," That is if we failed my facts."
"1199370","1200070"," I'll just do it this way."
"1200290","1200690"," Hold on here. "
"1204160","1206160"," The price target lower right here."
"1208840","1211060"," And you don't want to see."
"1214880","1216560"," You don't want to see this break right here. "
"1220770","1223350"," This is a three ninety seven fifty two."
"1223830","1224350"," Yep."
"1224650","1224890"," Right here. "
"1228340","1229660"," You don't want to see this break."
"1231840","1237400"," If you see a break below this you will see this this target right here."
"1238840","1239440"," Okay. "
"1242080","1250750"," The price target above remains the same four three sixty three."
"1250950","1253310"," We still have to tag this previous high here first."
"1254070","1254770"," And then get above. "
"1260660","1261200"," There we go."
"1268380","1270680"," We'll look at McDonald's and BX this morning."
"1271980","1273420"," What else do you guys have here. "
"1274100","1275260"," Stay above the blue line."
"1275260","1276380"," Stay above the blue line."
"1276860","1277300"," Yeah. "
"1277480","1279940"," Blue lines still underneath the green line too, which I don't like."
"1280200","1282380"," I don't want to see the blue line underneath the green line."
"1282580","1282720"," So. "
"1284300","1285980"," Let's see how we're just looking at it right now."
"1286120","1288400"," See how the blue the green line is above the blue line."
"1288400","1290340"," I want to see this blue line come above here. "
"1290600","1291920"," I want to see this blue line."
"1292480","1293440"," Get up here."
"1294080","1295280"," Get this green line underneath. "
"1298450","1299950"," And start to clean up."
"1299950","1304730"," We've got a small little gap here at four zero zero zero point five zero."
"1305730","1306630"," We've got a."
"1309170","1309910"," Right there. "
"1311270","1312490"," Small gap right here."
"1312750","1314610"," And we've got a previous high right here."
"1315670","1319210"," And we've got our one above four zero three six three. "
"1322410","1323870"," It's gonna be one of those days man."
"1323950","1327230"," It's gonna be one of those days where not a whole heck of a lot's going on."
"1327930","1329990"," I'm gonna put on the new squawk. "
"1330290","1337090"," I'm gonna put on spotty."
"1341220","1344020"," We're gonna take a look around the sectors in the market."
"1344820","1346580"," And just see what they look like this morning. "
"1347320","1348920"," If there's anything that we need to know."
"1357290","1360710"," Let's see if I can scroll through here and see if there's any news we need to know about."
"1362390","1364930"," Not much PMI came out. "
"1378280","1382180"," Yeah, I've got a S and P US manufacturing PMI flash."
"1383220","1393600"," 46.8. And 46.6. Previous was 46.2. And"
"1393600","1397340"," 46.7 kind of backing up the narrative that."
"1398800","1401940"," Don't pay attention to the yield curve inversion. "
"1403480","1405320"," Wednesday, we've got nothing scheduled."
"1406120","1416000"," And then on Thursday, we've got claims, continuing claims, GDP, durable goods, new home"
"1416000","1416780"," sales at 10."
"1417560","1423200"," Friday, we've got a real disposal income, real consumer spending PC, core PC,"
"1423860","1430940"," consumer sentiment index from University of Michigan. "
"1430940","1432000"," And then pending home sales."
"1435600","1437180"," Next Wednesday, we've got ADP."
"1438960","1442860"," The Fed looks keen on raising Fed funds rate to 5%. "
"1442860","1448580"," We expect the 25 basis point rate height next week, followed by another 25 basis point height in"
"1448580","1449920"," March and May respectively."
"1451180","1458280"," We've got the Fed's fund rate coming out on Wednesday, February 1st at 2 PM."
"1460640","1461880"," That's a next Wednesday. "
"1462620","1466640"," We know it's not every time, but we know that we typically buy the meeting."
"1467860","1470300"," And then we sell into the minutes."
"1470300","1471900"," We slowly sell into the minutes. "
"1472860","1475100"," So we'll find that when the minutes come out for."
"1476220","1477140"," Not for the minutes."
"1477720","1478960"," This is the Fed funds rate, right?"
"1480520","1482240"," PayPal news conference those at 2 30 PM. "
"1491540","1496260"," You've got the next F I'm seeing meeting January 28th through the 29th, I believe."
"1496480","1497220"," It could be wrong on that."
"1501680","1503000"," Weird that the Fed. "
"1505120","1507480"," It's being blocked by my pop up blocker."
"1508560","1515220"," So 2023 Fed meeting is January 31st until February 1st."
"1515760","1520400"," And then we get the actual fed funds rate on, I believe the first at two. "
"1520400","1525520"," And then we get the news conference at 2 30."
"1526780","1528880"," On the first, you know, Jerome's going to."
"1530020","1535440"," Jerome's going to be upset because it because he's not getting what he wants, right?"
"1535600","1540100"," He wants to raise rates and the market to trade sideways and go down. "
"1543910","1544990"," He's just cut rates."
"1545110","1547930"," If he wants the market to go down, he could just pause or cut rates."
"1548170","1549990"," The market would would just shit the bed. "
"1549990","1556830"," So it doesn't seem like he really wants to shit the market or shit the bed with the market at"
"1556830","1557230"," this point."
"1562010","1563270"," When do we have that?"
"1563690","1573480"," I saw this"
"1573480","1573940"," morning."
"1574320","1583640"," I saw this morning short seller ST made a post and he said, how do these people not realize that"
"1583640","1584620"," if they pause rates. "
"1586820","1589020"," That the market will shit the bed."
"1589320","1591940"," It's literally it's every time in history."
"1593640","1596240"," I don't think that there's another. "
"1596720","1598600"," Oh, should I just deleted this red box?"
"1599760","1600800"," Shouldn't have done that."
"1602880","1603680"," It's 396."
"1605440","1605960"," Yeah. "
"1609000","1609640"," 39371."
"1617780","1620960"," I think I think historically every time the Fed has cut rates."
"1622480","1623860"," I don't think there's another. "
"1624200","1627160"," I don't think that there's any other time in history where we haven't should the bed."
"1628900","1632240"," Sometimes it takes in your crazy part is if they ever if it leaks."
"1633600","1635180"," They'll crash the market before the announcement. "
"1636080","1638020"," There have been times in history when."
"1640200","1641220"," It's actually leaked."
"1643180","1644600"," There's a five minute chart right here. "
"1644700","1646060"," We want to see us get above the screen."
"1646480","1647280"," We're going to get above."
"1649540","1650420"," 39897 right now. "
"1659970","1661790"," Not a lot going on this morning."
"1674330","1675890"," Yeah, that is an absolute truth."
"1676410","1677190"," Like you won't see. "
"1677450","1679410"," So yesterday I posted on been to it."
"1679490","1680130"," I was I said."
"1681390","1683010"," It's trying to explain. "
"1683450","1685490"," I read an article by I guess."
"1685590","1689250"," Well, I was trying to fucking pose some kind of bullshit."
"1691650","1693670"," About QT and TUE. "
"1696250","1698750"," And it's all fucking comical."
"1698950","1703030"," It's like the first moment that somebody doesn't show up to the bond market."
"1703670","1705290"," Our economy will implode. "
"1706650","1709510"," If you look at commercial backsecurities."
"1711670","1714270"," You go and ask one of these guys to trade that stuff."
"1714410","1717750"," They'll they'll laugh at you if you think that. "
"1718230","1721750"," The Treasury Department is on board on QT."
"1721910","1722270"," They're not."
"1722590","1724210"," They do it when they can. "
"1724910","1726330"," But they can't."
"1726830","1728790"," And so when you hear like QT."
"1729410","1732670"," It's more about punishing the small guy. "
"1734010","1739970"," When you hear nonsense about large corporations not taking on debts or loans."
"1740490","1741430"," That's bullshit."
"1743750","1745190"," Companies will take. "
"1745730","1749310"," I was talking to Joe yesterday about it and he made a hilarious point."
"1749450","1749790"," He was like."
"1750470","1753670"," He's like you mean you mean I can take a loan today. "
"1754190","1758270"," And pay you back where the money that I owe you was worth less today than it was yesterday."
"1759130","1760930"," That's held true for 70 fucking years."
"1762370","1763490"," 70 years. "
"1764110","1764430"," So."
"1765310","1769950"," You know if you're if you're a company you're greedy and you're going to take debt on until you"
"1769950","1770510"," blow up."
"1771030","1772230"," That's just how it is. "
"1772450","1775890"," Especially if you think that you're going to be the biggest baddest company out there."
"1776570","1782130"," And it's never it's never like the cessation for debt taking on debt from companies."
"1782910","1787850"," Has only gone up and it and I'm talking like vertical. "
"1787850","1788070"," Vertical."
"1789970","1790730"," This year."
"1791250","1792190"," The year of QT. "
"1792710","1795610"," We've taken on more debt companies taking on more debt this year."
"1796190","1797490"," Then they have in history."
"1798390","1798670"," This year. "
"1799550","1803990"," So like that pure like pump, pump must consume."
"1804730","1805730"," Take on more debt."
"1806430","1808910"," Companies don't care if money is cheap or expensive. "
"1809770","1812270"," When they need or when they're given money they'll take it."
"1813050","1814930"," You need to understand that as a little guy."
"1814930","1817070"," The real story in the background. "
"1819050","1820410"," Is that."
"1821050","1822170"," The fed and the."
"1822730","1827530"," The politicians basically need to destroy you. "
"1827910","1831490"," If you're a guy out there woman out there and you've got a job."
"1832410","1834650"," They need to tax your ass."
"1835430","1835910"," Right. "
"1837390","1842410"," They need to tax you tax you tax you they need to find you they need to."
"1842410","1844250"," Fire you from your job."
"1845310","1850090"," And what that does is it puts pressure on companies. "
"1851490","1855850"," So you'll have a company like apple let's say and they'll say well shit nobody's buying my new"
"1855850","1858530"," iPhone right Tim apple be like I gotta lower prices."
"1858710","1861810"," Does it make sense so that people buy my iPhone."
"1862870","1864290"," The other issue is. "
"1865930","1868150"," That the fed tries to make you believe."
"1869550","1870190"," That."
"1871370","1872330"," They're helping. "
"1873050","1876590"," They really aren't the reality is there's a business cycle."
"1877210","1880610"," So if I find a business I have some smart people working for me."
"1883300","1887980"," I know when my company is in an expansion phase and phase and a contraction phase. "
"1888920","1890020"," I know that."
"1890860","1893540"," If I make some business decisions today."
"1895320","1897420"," In roughly seven to ten years. "
"1899380","1902080"," I'm either going to reap the benefits you could have a rip here."
"1902660","1906220"," You get the blue line crossing the green line right here I'm kind of bullish right here."
"1908220","1909060"," Kind of bullish. "
"1909800","1911380"," If we can close that gap above."
"1913880","1916100"," Well I'm gonna possibly set up a trade here."
"1917320","1919400"," So you realize that. "
"1920320","1924680"," You'll be like you'll hear or not you'll be like you'll be hearing people out there claiming shit"
"1924680","1925000"," like."
"1926200","1929020"," We claiming shit like old fed broke this company."
"1929320","1930860"," The truth is that wasn't the fed. "
"1931880","1936880"," If I make that poor business decisions I can usually in seven to ten years find out."
"1937400","1940120"," If those report business decisions right."
"1944580","1948420"," So as we're in a business cycle right at downturn in business cycle. "
"1948560","1950680"," You'll see companies like Microsoft tightening the belt."
"1951940","1955800"," You'll see that they they want to reassess where they are in the market."
"1955800","1959300"," This is all natural stuff that happens in a company's life. "
"1963810","1969650"," And you'll also after seven ten years you'll find other companies that made poor decisions."
"1970330","1973490"," And they will start to blow up right you'll find them blow up."
"1973490","1976870"," You'll find out that someone doesn't need the Mr. Pillow. "
"1977190","1981610"," Or someone doesn't need the exercise bike or someone doesn't need this or that."
"1982690","1985810"," And that's where companies get get squeezed right."
"1987270","1991610"," So when you see in the I like this weller guy talking I'm just like this is insane. "
"1991710","1993570"," Oh like you're not going to squeeze these companies."
"1994150","1997750"," You need to squeeze Captain Jim."
"1998030","2002550"," That's a private not a private but like let's say a say a master sergeant that's been working for"
"2002550","2004730"," 30 years and accumulated a bunch of bad debt. "
"2005270","2007230"," That's really truly who they need to hurt."
"2009070","2013610"," And like ST short seller said you're not going to see a true bottom in the market."
"2015170","2019390"," Until until the fed cuts rates. "
"2019390","2028810"," And my other pop I would add to that for myself at least that you won't yeah go long hair"
"2028810","2030870"," boys and girls you guys ready for a trade."
"2037590","2039310"," Four zero one."
"2041950","2044550"," I'm on four zero one here we're not yet. "
"2044790","2046570"," We had some to my position here."
"2046790","2047850"," Wait up for me."
"2057489","2060150"," One four zero one C's for today. "
"2063590","2066630"," Yes 1034 should have looked at that so."
"2071620","2077219"," It's just it's just bizarre it's like it's like you're not going to have a true bottom until."
"2078179","2082300"," We have an unemployment dump it's just not going to happen not not one that you can trust. "
"2084580","2088159"," You need to clear out people with bad debt."
"2092460","2096260"," It's it's a part of our system it's a part of our capital system is no way around it."
"2097720","2102420"," So I mean we can we can have a run this year I'm okay with the run until 2024. "
"2103320","2106220"," I'd even be okay with the side I wouldn't be okay with it but."
"2107260","2108840"," Sideways in the twenty twenty six."
"2110140","2115680"," But the truth is when you're seeing these companies they go through an expansion and a contraction"
"2115680","2117720"," phase you can already see. "
"2118740","2119520"," Plain as day."
"2120500","2123300"," The companies are in a phase of."
"2124380","2130240"," Finding out who's who's worthy in their company right who's been breaking their asses who's been"
"2130240","2133020"," actually working their asses off and not drinking lattes. "
"2133020","2139460"," And so you should see the employment rates increase right now over this next year you should see"
"2139460","2139660"," it."
"2140140","2145680"," In corporate America it's a real it's it's healthy and normal for companies to do this."
"2146140","2148120"," It's natural for a company to do this. "
"2150420","2151420"," One second here."
"2156860","2158720"," Yeah you see this blue line right here."
"2159240","2163800"," See how this see how this blue line is coming over the see this blue line right here. "
"2165740","2169880"," As long as we're as long as this blue line stays above right here."
"2170380","2172760"," I'm long so if we break below it."
"2173200","2177720"," I'll change but right now you see this blue line coming above right now. "
"2178280","2180640"," The screen line if this holds."
"2182420","2185360"," We're going to explode higher right now so I just want to make sure."
"2186480","2189920"," If you're in long with it right now that we don't go underneath right here. "
"2190700","2192720"," Because they're going to try to push it under right now."
"2193840","2195700"," Bears do not want to go higher."
"2198680","2200940"," I'm trying to give a liquidity break right here. "
"2203200","2207740"," Bears do not want to see a move higher here."
"2216160","2218600"," Seller rage."
"2224500","2234860"," Probably going to add some more there. "
"2240620","2242920"," So anyways my point being to you is that."
"2244500","2252180"," Be careful what you read on thin to it or in the news or what you read from the fed."
"2252740","2254720"," In the nonsense they speak about. "
"2255700","2261940"," The longer that they hold to their rate increases and because that much how much time is passed."
"2263540","2269380"," There was some argument that they might stay restrictive with rates for a period of years."
"2270280","2275940"," That could hold the market up believe it or not until we get true rate cuts. "
"2276720","2281300"," You may not see a bottom in the market for one two three four five years."
"2282400","2283640"," Truly in the background."
"2284520","2287340"," They're not going to tell you this but they want to see unemployment high. "
"2288120","2291900"," You're not going to see a rate cut until that happens."
"2292600","2293660"," It's not just inflation."
"2306210","2307630"," It's not long here right now. "
"2308590","2311970"," I want to make sure we don't get caught underneath this blue and green line right here."
"2313170","2316030"," I added to a position on that liquidity breakdown here."
"2320170","2323090"," I'm not talking as much and trying to pay attention to my position. "
"2370370","2374450"," The CPD synthesis says quarantine is still strong."
"2374690","2375990"," It's not over."
"2377050","2382430"," The CPD synthesis was both set to be historical averages and we could continue with half point rate"
"2382430","2382850"," types. "
"2386370","2389870"," Yeah, so that doesn't mean, you know, if you're a bull out there."
"2391370","2401090"," You're going to hear people try to sweet talk you into buying the market with no fear."
"2401970","2407230"," And that's the point that I'm trying to make, too, is that if you can buy the market, like you"
"2407230","2409730"," can buy, like, so I make an argument for buying Tesla. "
"2410070","2414650"," I'm like, you're going to buy Tesla at 100 bucks, and then you have some dry powder to buy it"
"2414650","2422770"," at 60, and then maybe even lower, right, 65, and then even if it goes as low as 40s or"
"2422770","2429610"," 20s, depending on how bad the real bottom is or wherever that is, you can DCA into it."
"2429730","2438050"," But I think it's, I think it's insincere of some bulls out there telling you that we've seen bottom"
"2438050","2440390"," because we more than likely have not."
"2440390","2446730"," And that's the, I think some bulls, especially investors that don't want to manage their"
"2446730","2451210"," portfolios, there are some bulls out there that are like, hey, I'm only looking for the true"
"2451210","2451490"," bottom. "
"2452910","2458170"," I want to buy a bottom, and I want to know that I don't have to look at it for"
"2458170","2464590"," six years or 10 years or 15 years or have any kind of fear."
"2466330","2473210"," I think there's a distinct difference between those two people, and I"
"2473210","2480630"," think there's like a muddling of the waters between those two types of people."
"2480810","2485970"," So if you're, if you're like the kind of guy or gal or whatever, or, you know, man, woman, child,"
"2486450","2493010"," I don't know, he, they, she, them, whatever you are, and you have to ask yourself, what am I,"
"2493110","2499130"," right, am I, am I an investor that's going to manage a position, right, DCA, a bottom, where I sell"
"2499130","2507270"," calls, in case we continue to go down, you know, you have to be managing your own money because you"
"2507270","2517470"," know, we've had this retail movement that began largely in 2000, and then the 2007 GFC, and"
"2517470","2523050"," then is now just exponentially growing to a point where everyone wants to manage the real money,"
"2523190","2528970"," right, you've got money managers, portfolio managers, and they're starving because you're, you've"
"2528970","2532410"," decided that you're, you're not going to let them grow your retirement, right. "
"2532650","2540050"," So if you're looking for an answer to that question, there's two answers, there's, if you think"
"2540050","2547330"," this is bottom, it likely is not on the scale of like a one to three, a one to three"
"2547330","2551490"," year time frame, it's likely not, you're likely going to see a lower price at some point."
"2552490","2558710"," Now, will they try to manage that for it, will they try to scam what that bottom is, sure, will"
"2558710","2565110"," the Fed try to, sure, but who doesn't want to buy Tesla at 20 bucks, I mean, a bank probably"
"2565110","2572450"," holds it at 20 bucks, so they have no problem, like accumulation and distribution has nothing to do"
"2572450","2574170"," with what the Fed tries to lie to you about."
"2574990","2585130"," These are banks that, you know, they buy when prices are cheap, right, they hold"
"2585130","2591790"," a bunch of this position, these are market makers, right, the market makers that they do is they"
"2591790","2598570"," buy a stock when it's cheap, and if this stock's not going to go bankrupt, they'll make a market"
"2598570","2605550"," for it someday, and when it gets high, high price, guess what they do, they take profit. "
"2606350","2614770"," Now, these cycles in business and these cycles in the stock market tend to line up together, you'll"
"2614770","2623490"," tend to see businesses expand and contract as the market expands and contracts, and in our economy"
"2623490","2630230"," does the same thing, we haven't seen high unemployment yet, so until we see that, and if you think"
"2630230","2634910"," right, this time is different, like that air quote, this time it's different, we're never going to"
"2634910","2644590"," have high unemployment again, you're smoking crack, you're smoking crack, oh, yeah, baby, girl up"
"2644590","2652920"," there, brought, now, we'll take all my money, we'll take all my money,"
"2652980","2664060"," now trading $0.70, I think I bought it $0.66 and then $0.43, start"
"2664060","2672380"," pushing, I want a little bit of confirmation here, I'm going to see this blue line come above here,"
"2672660","2683400"," right over here, and hopefully you can get a little bit of a bump here to go higher, you're"
"2683400","2692760"," day trading with Captain Jim, please put your seat trays in the upright position, put your seat"
"2692760","2702550"," belts on, and enjoy the ride, hopefully you're all just paper"
"2702550","2708930"," day trading, you're not actually this is it for entertainment purposes only, not financial advice,"

"2717930","2728610"," from an Xbox, and like I'm playing Super Mario Brothers, do"
"2728610","2738480"," not follow anything that I'm doing, when I get this blue"
"2738480","2748640"," line, just keep coming higher here, I want to see these bulls putting it together, they"
"2748640","2754680"," pretty much get an hour, an hour left, 1045, they got 45 minutes left to make a move for me"
"2754680","2764570"," to make me happy, so yeah, if you're the investor type, that's like I"
"2764570","2770150"," just want to buy some fucking Tesla stock and not have to add to it, you haven't seen your number"
"2770150","2775070"," yet, sure you, I don't know what that number is, it could be higher from here, but we haven't seen"
"2775070","2779030"," a bottom of the stock market until we get some higher employment, we're going to pump those numbers"
"2779030","2790310"," up, you understand, 401c is now trading 74 cents, oh"

"3175330","3185230"," We've got a speed bump of course here at 144.96. Speed bump here at 144.36. But"
"3185230","3190270"," ultimately the target above, you can show it here. "

"3459410","3463130"," We need to come back and fill that gap gap on the way up. "
"3463230","3463650"," We left behind."

"3501990","3505210"," Okay, so we're above the blue line right there."
"3507410","3509410"," So what are we bullish or bearish here?"
"3510150","3513310"," We're gonna look for a little bit of a pullback here. "
"3513970","3515170"," Blue line to come up."
"3517490","3518950"," It's screaming up right now."
"3520230","3522390"," Next target above 40265. "
"3537540","3544680"," Oh, thanks for tuning in every day with me here on YouTube."

"3573090","3575090"," Papasha's the Soviet submachine gun."
"3576370","3578890"," You know, I used to like that gun when I was a kid. "
"3579050","3586930"," I used to read G.I. Joe comic books and the G.I. Joe action figures from Russia."
"3586930","3589430"," I think one of those guys had a papasha."
"3589770","3591590"," It's a badass weapon right there. "
"3595260","3599740"," But the papasha is the daddy of Soviet machine guns."
"3602340","3604480"," Damn, trade the trigger."
"3607680","3608600"," Means father. "
"3609000","3612640"," Yeah, it says the daddy of some assuming that maybe daddy has something to do with it."
"3613120","3614900"," I appreciate the support papasha."
"3620840","3622840"," It was really the first word for your daughter spoke. "
"3623040","3623440"," That's awesome."
"3625600","3634440"," Yeah, it says here the daddy of the definition."
"3638100","3639200"," It's a wonderful name. "
"3639420","3640980"," I might have to have my youngest comic papasha."
"3645720","3647020"," Four possible meanings."
"3650160","3651260"," Don't give them to me. "
"3653740","3654300"," Papa."
"3654860","3655660"," Oh yeah, so Papa."
"3656540","3657380"," I like that name. "
"3657640","3659100"," My dad had me call him Papa."
"3659460","3660480"," I didn't call my father daddy."
"3661340","3662600"," Call my father Papa. "
"3662860","3663640"," He was in Vietnam."
"3665380","3667600"," And he worked with Montyards."
"3669160","3673560"," And he spent his first tour in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne. "
"3674100","3675260"," I haven't told this story."
"3675320","3676340"," You got to tell you guys a lot of stories."
"3676480","3677460"," But I haven't told this one. "
"3677820","3679600"," So my dad was a Vietnam veteran."
"3680880","3684960"," And he grew up poor like tons of kids like 13 kids in his family."
"3686980","3693040"," And my grandfather worked two jobs. "
"3694800","3700680"," And there were so many kids right that they would feed the kids two tables at a time."
"3701580","3704000"," So they would sit down the first batch of kids and they would eat."
"3704120","3707500"," And they would sit sit down the second batch of kids and they would eat. "
"3709200","3713340"," And he'll move these over for you so you can see him."
"3715200","3716660"," We got R1 right here."
"3720550","3726150"," And then my my grandfather would come home and he would sit down and eat. "
"3727270","3733710"," They they were so poor at one point previous day high."
"3736510","3743150"," So so poor at one point the boys had grown up previous."
"3744470","3745450"," Can't read this. "
"3745970","3746310"," So small."
"3747330","3748670"," Previous day high."
"3751430","3752350"," Right here. "
"3752670","3754050"," Here's R1 above."
"3755890","3763430"," They were so poor that when my my father and his brothers they were the girls but sprinkled up"
"3763430","3770950"," mostly boys that my grandmother would lock the cabinets so they didn't get eaten out of house and"
"3770950","3771170"," home."
"3772470","3775170"," So they were in their teenage years and they would just clean out the house. "
"3775370","3777070"," They would just go to town and start eating."
"3778690","3783290"," And so it became like a military thing right where where you just sit down and eat breakfast."
"3783290","3784310"," You come home for school. "
"3784450","3785330"," You eat dinner."
"3786550","3788570"," And you got what you got and you didn't complain."
"3790090","3797330"," So he was so when he was young he grew up poor. "
"3797470","3798230"," So he joined the army."
"3798550","3804430"," And this was prior to the draft I believe where they were going to institute the draft and he was"
"3804430","3805450"," like well I don't want to get drafted."
"3805450","3806630"," So I want to do what I want to do. "
"3806630","3808850"," And of course he was dumb young and dumb right."
"3809130","3815070"," So they say about some boys when they're ridden with testosterone or if they're ridden with"
"3815070","3818590"," testosterone with too much testosterone."
"3818670","3819650"," So he joined the army. "
"3819870","3825230"," He wound up becoming a 101st airborne which at that point they basically air assault."
"3826850","3827910"," And so he went to Vietnam."
"3828210","3833770"," He served in Quantry and Way and the Happy Valley. "
"3834110","3835340"," You guys don't know those places there."
"3836200","3843840"," And then he served a second tour he volunteered and he was in he worked with Mon yards."
"3844340","3846640"," These are these mountain men up in Vietnam. "
"3847760","3853680"," And so he had to learn French and he tried to help these people survive."
"3854180","3858060"," They had survived all these different wars."
"3858060","3865000"," Vietnam's got this great history where women ran their government because they've been at war for"
"3865000","3865880"," so many centuries. "
"3866580","3869220"," All these men had gone to die against all these foreign invaders."
"3870780","3873820"," And meanwhile you've got these mountain men in Vietnam that just lived in the mountains."
"3873820","3880660"," And he financed ministers to work on new funds and using any unemployment scheme or joint foreign"
"3880660","3882800"," schemes passed on to blind databases. "
"3884320","3890320"," It's really cool too because my dad brought home a lot of artifacts and guitars and stuff from"
"3890320","3890660"," Vietnam."
"3891080","3895300"," Went back to Vietnam too and met some of these people again years and years ago."
"3898000","3898880"," Hold on here. "
"3903140","3908280"," Okay hold on I got to get in a text from from a buddy here."
"3909500","3911060"," We're going to look at some things right now."
"3914660","3915900"," We're going to take a look at CES. "
"3917700","3923340"," And so anyway so I guess the point I'm trying to say here is a little out"
"3926190","3938350"," of"
"3938350","3938350"," here."
"3945330","3946970"," You dad was 100 first airborne too?"
"3947190","3947890"," Yeah 101 baby."
"3948990","3950670"," That's okay if you serve in the 50s. "
"3950750","3951530"," That's that's dangerous."
"3952590","3953230"," Thanks Andre."
"3953670","3954330"," Appreciate it man. "
"3954890","3955850"," Thanks for supporting the channel."
"3958030","3959270"," I served in Korea."
"3959650","3960410"," I was stationed in Korea. "
"3960490","3961190"," Korea is a rough place."
"3963650","3965770"," I would not have wanted to have been in the Korean War."
"3967870","3968570"," No way. "
"3968870","3969370"," No way."
"3969490","3970410"," The forgotten forgotten war."
"3970490","3971470"," Never would have wanted to have been there. "
"3975440","3978940"," But he uh so he wanted anyway get out of the house right."
"3979080","3982900"," It's like I'm not going to make me raised with all these other mouths to feed and stuff."
"3992170","3996610"," So he came home to the United States and that was the first born. "
"3996790","3998030"," I was my father's first son."
"3999770","4002310"," And he called he had us called him Papa."
"4002850","4004470"," And I loved calling him Papa. "
"4005110","4007990"," All my childhood until I became like a pre-teenager."
"4008350","4010990"," And then of course I was a pre-teenager the moral of the story."
"4011190","4018950"," I'm moral but the point of the story is that when I became a pre-teenager I was embarrassed that"
"4018950","4022370"," all of my friends called their father's dad. "
"4022630","4026510"," I felt like I wish my dad had had me call him dad."
"4026530","4027090"," I don't know why."
"4027870","4033190"," But now as an older man I'm so grateful that my father had me call him Papa. "
"4034150","4040050"," And my friends were jealous of my calling my father Papa as well."
"4040730","4041410"," They loved it."
"4041570","4043030"," So my friends called him Papa too. "
"4044510","4051050"," All my friends come over the house and they wouldn't address him as my father's name or surname."
"4051710","4052930"," They would just address him as Papa."
"4059430","4061030"," See if we can enter this trade one more time. "
"4063270","4064510"," Just kind of hanging out here."
"4067270","4070870"," Going to take a look at Spy real quick and see if we can get another reaction trade."
"4074330","4075670"," Take a look at it right here. "
"4077590","4078870"," See that nice little pump."
"4083100","4084280"," All right."
"4084280","4085940"," One the one minute right here right here. "
"4085980","4086900"," See that one minute win."
"4088120","4092880"," And I just want to see this come back down and see if trend is still alive right."
"4094380","4099340"," So we're just going to sit here and probably take another long here with a stop underneath it. "
"4101939","4104220"," And see if we can see we can get another trade in here."
"4104240","4105399"," So what we'll do is we'll look."
"4107399","4112640"," I'm going to write stop down below or add putting upon your risk appetite. "
"4115100","4119140"," You know you put it you put an add button right there and then you put an add button or"
"4119140","4120740"," a text to stop down below."
"4124270","4124970"," All right."
"4125170","4126310"," So you kind of trade the market. "
"4126870","4127930"," Stop down here."
"4128170","4130529"," Add down here and buy just above."
"4131510","4132569"," You guys getting this. "
"4134649","4137590"," This is not a recommendation to trade the stock market."
"4138149","4144649"," This is just a video game that we play here entertainment purposes only."
"4146510","4150910"," But if you were if I was trading the stock market this is what I would do here. "
"4151630","4153609"," We're looking for a buy on this blue line."
"4154450","4159109"," We'll be looking for an add below this blue line."
"4159270","4161310"," Maybe we have a liquidation breakdown here. "
"4161550","4162950"," So I'd probably have some like right here."
"4164810","4165770"," Some like that."
"4167990","4168470"," Right. "
"4168710","4170670"," So buy add and then stop down below."
"4171189","4171750"," Makes sense."
"4172550","4173970"," So I'm looking for a cheap price. "
"4174290","4180810"," I'm looking to to add my position if it doesn't go my way and then have a stop down below."
"4181450","4185410"," And what this accounts for is let's see have a quick liquidation breakdown here and then you sling"
"4185410","4186029"," shot higher."
"4186810","4187170"," Makes sense. "
"4187870","4192950"," If you break down here then you're looking for a stop down below right here."
"4193170","4193610"," Makes sense."
"4197690","4199430"," So you can plan out your trades. "
"4202110","4203390"," You have a target above."
"4204090","4204510"," Right."
"4204530","4208270"," So if you're making a trade in this market you should have this all planned out. "
"4208270","4208490"," Right."
"4208610","4210430"," You should be like okay so this is where I'm buying."
"4210650","4211190"," This is where I'm adding. "
"4211330","4212350"," This is where I'm putting a stop in."
"4212790","4214170"," This is where my target is above."
"4214810","4217650"," We've already nailed the previous high from the overnight. "
"4218510","4221210"," I'm hoping that my trade goes upright here."
"4221770","4225030"," And maybe does a little bit of consolidation and slams higher right here."
"4225210","4225310"," Right. "
"4225370","4228590"," So you have a plan for what you expect to happen."
"4228970","4234910"," If your plan fails let's say you plan this out and it goes doesn't go your way right."
"4235130","4239990"," Let's say you want to manage your trade and we come up here and we reject right. "
"4241570","4245110"," You already know that you don't want to see a rejection here right."
"4245770","4249590"," You can make a decision if you're going to add to your position right."
"4249810","4253910"," You could do an add if you wanted to or you just cut your losses up here depending upon your"
"4253910","4257690"," risk tolerance or you wait until we're under right. "
"4258010","4264390"," A five minute trigger and you cut your losses there but this is how you define your risk in the"
"4264390","4264710"," market."
"4265430","4267410"," You should be able to on your own."
"4269750","4271390"," Already know this in your mind. "
"4271650","4275250"," If you don't know how to do this in your mind how to plan this whole trade out from start"
"4275250","4281910"," to finish then stick around every day because we we draw these out for you every day so that you"
"4281910","4284570"," can get a firm idea of how to take a trade on your own."
"4285270","4285830"," Does that make sense?"
"4286330","4291230"," So you so that so that if you're if I'm not here one day you can be like yeah here"
"4291230","4291530"," you go."
"4292090","4293730"," I'm going to set this trade up right here. "
"4293730","4294690"," I have a defined losses."
"4294690","4301070"," I have defined gains above right my price target above."
"4301350","4302690"," I'm going to hold to my price target. "
"4303990","4309810"," Now how you structure that trade you can do a call spread just buying calls."
"4309930","4311270"," You can put a week on your trade."
"4312230","4314610"," You can be trying to just take 10% of this trade. "
"4314750","4320190"," You could be saying to yourself well if I get just this part right here in my my trade goes"
"4320190","4322450"," you're you're doing a 30 delta or better right."
"4323270","4328530"," On a call let's say by a call you do a 30 delta call and you're like I just need"
"4328530","4330560"," 10% right."
"4330740","4335780"," Some of you all are like no no no I need 100% you know and some of you all"
"4335780","4340160"," out there are like well I'm going to hold them till they go till they come up here and then"
"4340160","4342760"," come back down to the depth of L right. "
"4343480","4347800"," So you decide what's you decide for yourself the risk that you're putting on you define the risk"
"4347800","4352440"," that you're putting on and you define the profit that you want to make off of your trade."
"4361550","4363310"," So 40265."
"4364070","4366350"," 402s are 48 cents. "
"4368590","4372130"," They have a 27 delta that's pretty close."
"4374210","4378070"," The highest concentration of calls are 400c."
"4379210","4380810"," They're already in the money. "
"4381310","4382890"," I'm not going to expect a day today."
"4383830","4390310"," I'd really like to see those that concentration of calls move on down and reposition."
"4390710","4391550"," Haven't seen that yet. "
"4392110","4393130"," Haven't bought anything yet."
"4394590","4395850"," I'm just watching right now."
"4396470","4397530"," This is the last part. "
"4397730","4403210"," This is the part of the trade where I have what's called patience."
"4404110","4406170"," So I'm going to watch right now and see what's happening."
"4406650","4408150"," We're breaking below the one minute trigger. "
"4408370","4409130"," Don't like seeing that."
"4412690","4414350"," I'm going to have patience right here."
"4415430","4417470"," I'm just going to watch this trade as it unfolds. "
"4422110","4424070"," Still have more buyers than sellers."
"4424810","4426330"," Market is supportive right now."
"4427530","4429750"," 402c is their 39 cents right now. "
"4430330","4430610"," Pretty cheap."
"4432190","4433630"," Close to want to start a position here."
"4438930","4439730"," Oh yeah. "
"4439870","4441190"," I can get a liquidity breakdown there."
"4441790","4443310"," Calls are now 36 cents."
"4444350","4447190"," I might actually go back up the 401 because they're getting so cheap. "
"4447910","4450690"," So I'm probably going to go and switch from 401 to 402."
"4451750","4453130"," Those are now getting cheap again."
"4453310","4454510"," They're 67 cents. "
"4460700","4462720"," I bought some for 68 cents."
"4463000","4464940"," About a five pack for 68 cents."
"4465060","4466700"," I'm going to add another five pack here in a minute. "
"4469320","4470920"," So I've got five contracts."
"4471960","4475180"," If we come back down here at all, I'll buy another five contracts."
"4475980","4478420"," If we come down here, I'll probably add 10 more contracts. "
"4478820","4478940"," Okay."
"4479560","4480700"," I'm in for five right now."
"4494790","4498410"," I can get like 20, 20 contracts or so down here for this trade. "
"4498550","4499090"," I'll be happy guy."
"4516320","4517980"," Now trading 72 cents."
"4525080","4527160"," To be a time to put some limit stops in. "
"4530760","4532640"," Now trading 74 cents."
"4574230","4575690"," Almost breakeven right now."
"4575750","4577070"," They're at 66 cents. "
"4605820","4608040"," Now trading 67 cents down a penny."
"4619160","4621900"," Almost rate add to it to this position here in just a second."
"4622140","4623040"," I can get down a little bit more. "
"4629000","4629760"," Almost there."
"4637780","4639120"," Come on down a little bit more."
"4659660","4661100"," Do one more red candle. "
"4664540","4665400"," Just touch it."
"4665560","4666480"," Touch the green, baby."
"4683230","4684650"," Doesn't want to come down here for me. "
"4700120","4702360"," Still have more buyers than sellers right now."
"4719840","4722160"," Still under the one minute trigger."
"4763660","4765640"," Now I want you to see something here. "
"4769310","4774210"," I want to see a break above here."
"4775570","4778510"," We don't get a quick break above this blue line quickly."
"4779150","4781290"," I'm going to cut myself out of this trade here. "
"4782010","4784190"," So I want to see this move quickly higher."
"4785190","4788390"," If we don't see this quick move higher right now, the next like five minutes."
"4789610","4795090"," If we start doing this bullshit over here where we start to bounce around in here, I'm probably"
"4795090","4796530"," going to switch to the put side. "
"4799620","4804040"," For the next few minutes, I want to see this break above this blue line like right away."
"4806060","4807840"," Now trading 66 cents."
"4809160","4811220"," I'm going to switch to sell here just in case. "
"4831820","4833660"," I'm going to put a stop limit in here."
"4840410","4850200"," I got a"
"4850200","4851980"," stop trigger at 59 cents here."
"4855650","4857930"," I don't want to see this right here. "
"4857930","4861310"," I don't want to see this like this kind of nonsense."
"4863550","4870000"," If I see that, I'm going to be looking for a put down here."
"4884590","4886870"," I have not added to the position yet. "
"4888210","4889830"," I'm not liking this."
"4892590","4898090"," I wanted to see the trade immediately kind of take off down here like this."
"4899170","4904370"," And I never like seeing the dragging out of the dragging out of the time it's taking here. "
"4908880","4911320"," I don't like the no new high right there."
"4922370","4923450"," Z-puts."
"4924470","4925750"," Z-puts. "
"4925750","4926190"," Z-puts."
"4931290","4932370"," Price target above."
"4932730","4933550"," Previous day high. "
"4933910","4934570"," Still right there."
"4937130","4939470"," Balls need to get over this blue line right now."
"4939490","4940010"," Damn it. "
"4940650","4942030"," Get above that blue line, baby."
"4950980","4951740"," Oh, yeah."
"4952140","4954040"," 401 is now trading 72 cents. "
"4956060","4957300"," Get up there, you dirty dog."
"4957720","4961120"," 24 and a fire high yield of 4.5. Yep, there you do, you dirty dog."
"4961380","4964340"," We suspecting comments from SMB is illegal at the bottom of the spot. "
"4964380","4964640"," Slegal."
"4965180","4968020"," Yep, there you do, you dirty dog."
"4969220","4970240"," Dude, come on. "
"4977660","4978460"," Oh, shit."
"4986210","4987270"," Now, 1,122."
"4988950","4990670"," Oh, there's a little buy right there. "
"4991070","4992250"," There's a little green bar right there."
"4994890","4996810"," A little green bar, a little volume bar."
"4997110","5000010"," A little sneaky ball green, yellow green bar right there. "
"5004490","5005250"," Hold on."
"5005530","5006290"," I'm going to stretch my back."
"5007210","5007730"," Hold on. "
"5007770","5009050"," I'm going to do a workout if we're going to go up."
"5016370","5017070"," Hold on here."
"5017210","5018270"," I'm going to get my weights going here. "
"5018810","5021510"," Tighten them up a little bit."
"5022310","5023310"," Hold on a second here."
"5023870","5026290"," Come on now. "
"5027630","5038390"," 1 or that's 3, 2, 1 and a half, 0, 0 again, and"
"5038390","5039010"," another again."
"5040050","5041990"," Yeah, there we go."
"5043110","5044030"," Get up there. "
"5055520","5056980"," Give me some muscle failure."
"5057260","5058900"," Give me some muscle failure."
"5059480","5060880"," Give me some muscle failure. "
"5061040","5061940"," Give me some muscle failure."
"5061940","5063240"," Give me some muscle failure when we get up there."
"5064000","5065000"," Make me some money. "
"5069480","5070960"," Now, trading 80 cents."
"5077440","5079160"," Now, trading 82 cents."
"5083820","5086820"," Now, trading 83 cents. "
"5088400","5091600"," Okay, we'll take the money."
"5096740","5100120"," I got one big right arm and like a small left arm."
"5101640","5102400"," Oh, yeah. "
"5109820","5111820"," Do some push-ups for me out there."
"5112020","5114060"," Get on the office floor."
"5114280","5117760"," Get on your office floor if you're at home or your office floor at work. "
"5118960","5123240"," If you're in the dungeon with the server racks, get on the floor and start pushing for me."
"5131270","5133530"," Who's expecting possible comments from SMB's?"
"5133670","5137310"," Start fucking doing your morning workout here."
"5140910","5142810"," Gonna get that blood flowing in the morning. "
"5169230","5170190"," That blood's working now."
"5170450","5172910"," That'll keep you warm, keep you alive, keep you awake."
"5182790","5184770"," Hot girls summer 2023, baby. "
"5186630","5195330"," Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do some jumping jacks."
"5196950","5197790"," Oh, you want to know a good one?"
"5198710","5206150"," No, when I was in the army, we'd have to They'd teach you about your rifle and they're like, I"
"5206150","5208790"," think our rifle was 5.7 pounds."
"5209930","5212250"," And you'd think they'd be like, that's light, right?"
"5212650","5218790"," So they'd make you hold it out in front of you until it becomes heavy. "
"5221470","5223770"," It didn't take long for it to become heavy."
"5225370","5229570"," To grab that coffee mug and just hold it out with your right arm until your arm fails."
"5231630","5234830"," Hold that baloney sandwich out with your left arm until it fails. "
"5244620","5249000"," All right, let's take a look at, um, we're going to look at CVS."
"5253280","5254960"," Oh, yeah, CVS."
"5255900","5258080"," I want you guys to see something here real quick. "
"5259120","5260900"," Oh, look at Spy moving."
"5263160","5264580"," Look at Spy moving."
"5265020","5268480"," We have someone get someone dropped us a little intel here. "
"5269800","5279100"," Can someone tell me when CVS has their CVS has their, um, their ER?"
"5281480","5282320"," Anybody know?"
"5283540","5289340"," Did you guys know that CVS, um, just signed a bunch of government contracts and stuff?"
"5290240","5292580"," They're doing a bunch of work with the government now."
"5294060","5294880"," Oh, yeah."
"5297140","5298320"," Oh, look at that. "
"5301760","5303440"," You got some upper targets, right?"
"5303620","5313380"," You got a target of 87-21, 88-78, 91-50 in 95 dollars."
"5313560","5314920"," When's their ER coming up, right?"
"5319140","5322720"," It's been trading under, under its trigger for some time now."
"5324480","5327400"," What you want to be doing is let's have a quick peek here. "
"5329340","5330700"," Let's have a look see here."
"5332140","5334740"," As long as it's trading, get a note pad out."
"5335680","5336900"," Get a note pad out. "
"5338540","5345140"," As long as CVS is trading, currently trading above 86-62, right?"
"5346620","5351920"," You want to be watching it for a price target above of 87-22."
"5353320","5359580"," So if it doesn't get immediately rejected, they're shortly taking the results to the US 52 week"
"5359580","5361580"," bill auction, as well as comments from SMB."
"5361780","5367580"," Right, if it doesn't get immediately rejected or you take the money off the table, right?"
"5368020","5373900"," If it can get above here and start moving higher, right, you'll see this trigger come up. "
"5374860","5382840"," Take a price target of 87-20 and then maybe jump back in again and you've got a if you"
"5382840","5389540"," can hold 87-24 your next target above is going to be 88-80."
"5390900","5395560"," You get back out again and look for some consolidation."
"5397100","5398540"," Check back in on this broadcast. "
"5400220","5409680"," Let me hit those numbers and then your target above 88-80 is going to be 91-60 and then"
"5409680","5413960"," 95-flat, 95-flat on CVS."
"5416300","5417620"," Now, could it go higher than that?"
"5417840","5419180"," Sure, but there's a lot of work for bulls."
"5419420","5420660"," They got a ton of work they have to do. "
"5421740","5426540"," You can take a screenshot of that if you'd like and then come back and look at these numbers over"
"5426540","5426780"," here."
"5427260","5435980"," We mute my webcam frame here and you can just take a snap of that."
"5438180","5439960"," You want to stay above 86-80. "
"5441060","5444360"," Take a little come back in the broadcast, snap a picture of that."
"5444360","5453340"," Now you can always ask in the broadcast and I will revisit CVS again for you."
"5460000","5463080"," Rejection off the previous high bears don't want to give this up. "
"5465760","5467520"," You want to see what happens here."
"5473670","5477510"," You want to put some stops in so I'm going to show you where to put your stops right here."
"5479670","5480950"," Put your stop right here. "
"5482830","5484070"," This is a liquidity break."
"5488930","5490430"," You don't want to see this rejection."
"5491570","5493450"," You want to see a break above right now. "
"5494150","5497230"," It's fine seeing that one, but you don't want to see that one."
"5497350","5501190"," You want to see a new high in this run right here."
"5501350","5506990"," If you don't see the new high right here, we get kind of bearish here, okay?"
"5507610","5508970"," So put some stops in down below. "
"5510910","5514130"," You never want to see the double rejection."
"5514550","5515830"," Double top is what they call it, right?"
"5516850","5519050"," We want to see continuation here higher."
"5519190","5521670"," If we don't see that continuation higher, we're going to look for a lower low. "
"5522230","5524470"," We will retest this low down below here."
"5525330","5528530"," It would be the next stop if we don't."
"5528550","5529930"," We'll take a look at this red bar. "
"5530050","5531210"," Is that red bar down below there?"
"5531570","5537050"," 7% is the high rate of 4.47% for 4.47% The U.S.L. 38 billion"
"5537050","5540450"," dollars awarding 98.5% of fits at high."
"5546050","5548790"," The most bullish outcome would have been a break above here."
"5548970","5549830"," We didn't see that, right?"
"5550090","5551530"," See, we're watching for that break above. "
"5552230","5553590"," We didn't quite see it."
"5554130","5555590"," So we're losing some momentum."
"5557610","5558350"," There's time passes. "
"5558610","5560190"," We don't want to lose momentum in the market, right?"
"5560470","5561270"," We don't like seeing this."
"5562750","5564650"," We don't like seeing the double top."
"5564710","5566130"," We want to see a break above. "
"5566130","5568310"," A new high, right?"
"5568510","5569370"," Think about that in your mind."
"5569370","5571830"," How bullish am I, right?"
"5574650","5577410"," You don't want to be in a long call here and be like, oh, yeah, shit, we got rejected."
"5577610","5582370"," You want to be in a long call here and break above with some being convincing, right?"
"5582670","5583530"," For that next move higher. "
"5583610","5587710"," If you don't see that, you like I'm moving my stops up."
"5587710","5592430"," I'm going to take like two cents or five cents or whatever, right?"
"5592650","5593830"," Don't ever give your money back."
"5594030","5597670"," Even if we break higher here, you want to have a stop down below and never give money back to"
"5597670","5598370"," the big boys. "
"5608190","5608590"," You want to have a stop down below and never give money back to the big boys, right?"
"5608590","5608710"," Whoo."
"5609070","5609750"," Hey, sloth."
"5610110","5610610"," How are you?"
"5615800","5616420"," Makes sense. "
"5616640","5617480"," Stop right down here."
"5630000","5634140"," If you're going to get back in here, you can always wait for the trade higher."
"5634460","5639040"," So what you'll be looking for is if you like, I want to re-enter this trade though cap, I"
"5639040","5639760"," don't want to lose any money. "
"5639920","5646100"," You're just going to wait for the green bar to come back up and continue along for the next move"
"5646100","5646680"," higher, right?"
"5646840","5648340"," So this is where the money is right here."
"5649240","5650200"," That's where the money is."
"5651540","5656680"," And if you can, you know, like I took this trade for a move higher and it's not happening, right?"
"5656940","5660700"," You cut yourself off so that you can reposition again higher. "
"5663700","5666320"," So my stops triggered just about two minutes ago."
"5667060","5670660"," So I'm out of my long here, plus I was fucking around with CVS, probably should have taken the"
"5670660","5671460"," money up here, but whatever."
"5672100","5673040"," That doesn't mean anything. "
"5673380","5675300"," So I'm out in flat right now, okay?"
"5675500","5676920"," So now what am I looking for?"
"5677040","5685240"," I'm looking for this blue line to be regained or for this green line down here to hold, right?"
"5685440","5687400"," But I never like seeing this."
"5687520","5693520"," So if you're a bear out there when you're looking for a setup, these are usually good setups for"
"5693520","5693680"," bears."
"5694000","5695640"," You get the drive higher, right?"
"5696460","5700320"," Come back down, test the five minute, right?"
"5700320","5701400"," We broke the one minute. "
"5702140","5707540"," So if we're going to go back and test the five minute, we better get, like, win the one minute"
"5707540","5708720"," and then get a new high."
"5708900","5709400"," Does that make sense?"
"5710300","5711400"," So bulls are looking for that."
"5711480","5716560"," If you're a bear and you see that the bulls were not able to hold the five, take the one"
"5716560","5719980"," and then get a new high, that's a check mark against the bulls. "
"5720520","5721040"," You get what I'm saying?"
"5721480","5723600"," Or an X against the bulls, not a check mark."
"5724460","5729040"," If the bulls were down here, we broke the one minute, go to the five minute and then the bulls"
"5729040","5733060"," come up and get the new high, that's bullish, right?"
"5733520","5735600"," You wouldn't want to be shorting this right here, would you?"
"5736240","5736680"," No."
"5736980","5741400"," So if you see that we don't get the new high after coming down to the five, we don't get"
"5741400","5748200"," the new high and then we break below the one, let's start getting kind of like, eh, you know, like"
"5748200","5753980"," maybe sniffing around the bulls and being like, do you actually have this, bro?"
"5755060","5756260"," Like, you got this, bro?"
"5756820","5758120"," Because I don't know if you do, Doug. "
"5759120","5759820"," You know what I'm saying?"
"5759960","5763380"," So you just start out, so you start questioning yourself, you're like, the bulls have this?"
"5765260","5766580"," They say they have it, man."
"5766760","5767780"," They're buying down here."
"5769760","5771240"," But I don't know if they have it. "
"5772860","5776820"," If you at least be sniffing around, be like, you got this."
"5777320","5778140"," You sure you got this?"
"5780600","5781800"," I don't know if you got this."
"5781800","5790820"," I just cracked my back. "
"5792420","5795740"," We need to start questioning it, starting to sniff around."
"5797880","5804120"," And you'd be wanting some, if you're a bear, you'd want some, you want some continuation down."
"5804460","5811280"," You'd want to see like a failure of the one start doing this nonsense and then boom, you get down"
"5811280","5811660"," right here. "
"5814240","5814600"," Right?"
"5814760","5815820"," Failure of a new high."
"5817180","5819460"," Now you're a bear, you're watching this."
"5819640","5821640"," You're a bear, you're like, oh yeah. "
"5823120","5826180"," You're like, uh, I'm going to set up some books in here."
"5827340","5829140"," You're not going to buy them yet, but you're going to set them up."
"5830640","5831900"," And you're like, I'm just waiting. "
"5832520","5837880"," If I can, if we bleed down here and we get underneath right here, you already know where this"
"5837880","5839240"," previous low is down here."
"5840200","5844820"," And you're like, oh yeah, I just want to get underneath here and cool or trick these bulls and I"
"5844820","5847880"," think and they still have the five minute and then we're going to blast them down to here."
"5852270","5863010"," So they start getting bearish, not quite bearish yet, but not"
"5863010","5865150"," quite hairy yet, but want to get hairy, right?"
"5871170","5872130"," Smelling these bulls. "
"5873850","5875330"," Am I smelling bullshit yet?"
"5876490","5879330"," Because bulls are telling me that they've got more buyers than sellers."
"5879890","5885770"," I don't know if they do or don't right now, but I keep my eye on them in the corner."
"5886270","5887950"," Keep my gnarly eyeball out over here. "
"5889730","5892430"," I used to read these bear fables back in the day."
"5893390","5896430"," I sit around the campfire with my daddy and my mommy."
"5897250","5899630"," My dad would break out the old bear fables. "
"5901710","5906950"," Tell me stories of blood and the bears crying or bulls crying."
"5910050","5914830"," Tell me stories of old where a bull would be up in a penthouse somewhere."
"5915190","5922430"," He'd have his Lamborghini and then my uncle bear would drive up the tow truck and he'd take it away"
"5922430","5922970"," from him. "
"5924270","5930270"," Made my uncle very happy every time I'd go and bring the tow truck over and take that limbo away"
"5930270","5931330"," from that goddamn bull."
"5933850","5936870"," And like him, I'm going to follow him in his footsteps."
"5938590","5942750"," And I too want to take that tow truck, take that Lamborghini away from that bull. "
"5946870","5948190"," Come on down."
"5949530","5950410"," Come on down."
"5950570","5953510"," Come on down to Bulltown, or Beartown, sorry. "
"5955190","5956690"," We'll write Beartown down below."
"5959330","5960110"," Here's Beartown."
"5963510","5964510"," Come on down to Beartown. "
"5966850","5968410"," That's the bear's the saying right now."
"5969170","5969830"," Like come on down."
"5970230","5971070"," Come on down to Beartown. "
"5971850","5972790"," Come on down visit."
"5974790","5977010"," We got good credit, bad credit, no credit."
"5980960","5982660"," You can buy your Lambo down here. "
"5982900","5988000"," And if you fail to make payments, we'll just bring our, we'll just bring our or bear Lambo."
"5991280","5992560"," Bear Lambo down there."
"5998320","6000100"," We'll give you your Lambo, you miss payment. "
"6000540","6002020"," We'll bring you on down to Beartown."
"6006060","6007360"," Bull's starting to win it back now."
"6008820","6009800"," Bull's like we ain't done. "
"6011300","6013120"," I want to hold my Lambo for a little bit longer."
"6022970","6023990"," We'll see what's going on here."
"6030150","6041830"," Bear's up here like If"
"6044740","6048320"," you guys have me on your office somewhere, they're probably like, who is that lunatic?"
"6059350","6061090"," Come on down to Beartown. "
"6061390","6062550"," Gonna make your port mine."
"6073170","6075450"," Oh no, we'll save just a bear tow truck."
"6075990","6078030"," It's not material on it. "
"6078030","6078290"," Hold on."
"6078970","6079930"," Bear's towing."
"6082850","6089850"," So just to repeat that Jimmy's tonsilless shelter is so they were saying that many predictors has"
"6089850","6090070"," not. "
"6090130","6091490"," This bear is towing down here."
"6099930","6102150"," This is the repo lot over here."
"6105260","6106860"," The repo lot down below. "
"6110820","6115900"," Do we get the promise of Lambo's above?"
"6125710","6127730"," We'll turn this one green over here."
"6129050","6130590"," Promise of Lambo's."
"6134970","6136050"," Bear's towing. "
"6136830","6138430"," We get the repo lot down below."
"6153520","6155300"," You have bull's wives calling."
"6175540","6176660"," Snow is good. "
"6177340","6178100"," Slopes were empty."
"6179500","6180420"," They got hammer with snow."
"6181460","6182780"," I think a week and a half ago. "
"6183560","6185100"," And they had some snow coming in this week."
"6185100","6190540"," So when is the we already have when is when the fuck is president's day week?"
"6191440","6196040"," Do we already have that?"
"6198480","6200820"," Oh yeah, you're going for president's day week."
"6200820","6201800"," Oh man. "
"6205060","6214740"," It's it's really busy and it gets really it gets really crowded during"
"6214740","6215500"," president's week."
"6216000","6219500"," The only thing that I would recommend is I did I do what it's busy."
"6219800","6220840"," I do like the. "
"6223780","6233700"," If you're going to be in Park City specifically, I really do like the higher elevations of PCMR and"
"6233700","6235360"," parts of canyon lands."
"6235980","6238500"," But you want to stay away from the lower elevations."
"6239500","6241780"," You want to like get up high and into the trees. "
"6243380","6247640"," Get up to McConkie's way and stuff like that or no wait a minute."
"6247720","6257620"," Yeah, McConkie's way is up in PCMR. Yeah, third Monday in"
"6257620","6258280"," February, right?"
"6258440","6259320"," Is that when you're going or no?"
"6261060","6262620"," Are you going on the third Monday of February?"
"6264440","6266260"," Or are you going to the beginning of February?"
"6270920","6271940"," Take the bus everywhere. "
"6274440","6275960"," Bus is key in Park City."
"6280380","6283020"," If you if you are going, shoot me a DM."
"6283320","6285340"," I've got some friends that own restaurants there. "
"6286500","6289560"," If you want to go out to eat, I'll see if I can get you a nice, a nice spot"
"6289560","6290620"," or a free dinner or something."
"6299800","6301260"," Implied move for Tesla ER."
"6301260","6302620"," Yeah, I'll give you that right now. "
"6302980","6304600"," You want the implied move for ER for Tesla?"
"6306100","6306740"," Hang tight."
"6307200","6307980"," I will give it to you."
"6313200","6315120"," Implied move for Tesla ER. "
"6316000","6316520"," Is."
"6319480","6322120"," You know what we should we should do is how about this?"
"6322260","6323400"," I'll give you a bunch of different stuff."
"6324180","6325620"," You know what's cool stuff for you?"
"6326220","6328020"," We'll start with Tesla ER. "
"6330680","6332500"," And then we'll talk about."
"6339190","6340250"," Hang tight here."
"6340830","6342690"," SMB Schlegel, this is the SMB station. "
"6342810","6343310"," Schlegel."
"6343510","6346910"," Grow for 045% in 2023 in no recession."
"6351910","6358770"," So Tesla's implied move is 7.9%. That's after hours. "
"6362010","6368550"," And I do want you to know that be hyper aware."
"6370410","6375350"," First off, Tesla is, oh man, I want to buy some calls here again alone."
"6375350","6382260"," And I want this so bad. "
"6382960","6384080"," Hold on a second here."
"6384180","6384820"," I want to look at this."
"6386440","6386960"," Yep. "
"6392680","6395060"," All right, some back end spy again."
"6398120","6403860"," Oh man, I'm going to put some fucking I'm going to put some fucking I don't like this here, but"
"6403860","6405020"," I'm long calls again."
"6405500","6407200"," So I'm just going to talk about Tesla real quick. "
"6408260","6412080"," Not paying attention to the fucking market because all over manages trade."
"6412480","6416340"," Okay, so let's talk Tesla real quick."
"6417000","6424040"," So Tesla, it's the most highly traded stock in the stock market. "
"6424220","6426960"," So I need you to believe me when I tell you this, okay?"
"6427900","6433680"," Please I've I've traded Tesla ER's fucking I don't know how many years I've traded."
"6434400","6436140"," So too many committed to count."
"6436520","6443400"," So I want to show you something here, okay?"
"6445620","6447340"," Okay, I'm gonna it doesn't matter. "
"6448440","6449740"," Okay, hold on."
"6449860","6450980"," I'm going to stop on this trade."
"6451200","6464110"," Okay, I'm"
"6464110","6466290"," going to bring up Tesla here, okay?"
"6472360","6473740"," Here's earnings, right?"
"6473740","6474740"," 25th. "
"6476120","6484200"," They have an implied move up or down of on their next expiry of 7.9 percent."
"6484900","6487100"," So bulls are expecting 155, 54."
"6487960","6489780"," Bears are expecting 132, 80. "
"6490360","6494060"," I don't know how true this is here because I'll be honest with you."
"6494500","6500080"," If you break below that 132, 80, you look up on the screen here right here, you have the screen"
"6500080","6500520"," over here."
"6501280","6508140"," If you break below that 132, 81, it opens the door to like 95 dollars on Tesla. "
"6509160","6510200"," Be aware of that."
"6512620","6515180"," 155 really doesn't do anything for you."
"6515180","6522820"," It actually opens the door to I would say to you a positive that if you get a good ER,"
"6524300","6526660"," you're going to go way higher than this number right here. "
"6526660","6527760"," You're going to hit 196."
"6529520","6532920"," If and then all the onus is on the bulls here."
"6533140","6536080"," If the bears break this down here, you're going to 95. "
"6536520","6539660"," I almost promise you, not guaranteed, but almost promise you."
"6541320","6542920"," 95 is on deck."
"6544320","6550700"," That 132, 133 is really a problem for bulls and the key for bears. "
"6552940","6557120"," The other issue here is we were rejected off 135."
"6557760","6558840"," Then we broke through 135."
"6559740","6565220"," If we get sent back under 135, you're looking for the next level of support. "
"6565740","6567720"," And the next level of support is closing the gap down."
"6567860","6569760"," I believe it's 95 or 96 dollars."
"6570440","6572340"," Now, I'm saying all of this, right?"
"6574420","6579320"," Oftentimes with Tesla, you'll see, let's say they have a good ER, right?"
"6580280","6584520"," You'll see like the swing up into the other earnings. "
"6584920","6589560"," And if they have nothing to add that you don't know, they're going to have a stock split or"
"6589560","6592240"," something you don't know, it comes literally back down by open."
"6593540","6598580"," They will murder, not always, but most of the time, you should expect that they're going to murder"
"6598580","6608200"," all of these options and that you're going to lose interest in these options because the"
"6608200","6610140"," event is over, right?"
"6610300","6611540"," We're moving on to the next event."
"6612380","6622160"," So they might not print until the next expiry, or even the one after that, your"
"6622160","6622520"," calls. "
"6623120","6632980"," So if you're bullish on it, what you could do in Tesla is buy like a call spread strangle and"
"6632980","6634220"," a put spread strangle."
"6635440","6639900"," You could buy like an in the money put spread or a way outside the money put spread."
"6641540","6649040"," Down at $95 or something, $95 to $100, and you could buy one that's like $198 up here with enough"
"6649040","6651940"," time on it, maybe farther out in time. "
"6652140","6659060"," That way you could cut one side loose or if we squeeze up and then bloodbath it down, and you"
"6659060","6662420"," know you had a good ER, you could take the money in the put side and then hope that this"
"6662420","6664820"," one prints down the road is my point."
"6665840","6669420"," I would be hesitant on Tesla to take a straddle."
"6669420","6672720"," That's like the upcoming expiry. "
"6673480","6677960"," You could possibly take a straddle that's dated farther out, up or down if you wanted to."
"6678560","6681980"," Even if we blast down, it typically comes back by open."
"6682980","6689520"," Like they don't, the dealers love the lead up to earnings and they get you on board. "
"6689700","6691000"," The dealers are like, yeah, we'll take your money."
"6691040","6691740"," Yeah, we'll take your money."
"6691840","6692460"," Yeah, we'll take your money. "
"6692500","6693160"," Yeah, we'll take your money."
"6693200","6694460"," You buy them puts, I'll take your money."
"6695320","6696780"," And the moment they have their ER, right?"
"6700780","6706000"," The trade is actually a synthetic trade on the spire, the cues, right, and it comes right back. "
"6706540","6707840"," Like we could bloodbath it down."
"6712320","6717880"," Squeeze it back up, wait until the ER is, or wait until that expire is done and they bloodbath it"
"6717880","6718160"," down."
"6718840","6723400"," It's not always, if they have more, they have more people piling in puts that'll sometimes go down,"
"6723600","6726000"," but dude, Tesla, all tickers out there. "
"6726000","6729940"," I've never had many good experiences."
"6731120","6739120"," You could sell the ball on the trade, but I've never had many good experiences trading Tesla after"
"6739120","6741700"," ER, unless they have an announcement."
"6742380","6743480"," But I mean like an announcement. "
"6743880","6747820"," Not, oh yeah, we did fucking an extra 500,000 cars."
"6748060","6748840"," That shit doesn't work."
"6749020","6754920"," You need like, he needs something like the truck is being launched today. "
"6756160","6761660"," Like not talk about an SUV, not talk about fucking what we're talking about, or some shit in the"
"6761660","6763480"," future, or some fucking improvement."
"6764760","6766040"," None of that shit's gonna work."
"6766240","6768420"," You have to have like, lemme make cameras still low right now. "
"6769500","6777160"," You need to have, you need to have, or so high, you need to have like, like, actionable news, like"
"6777160","6778180"," we're splitting the stock."
"6779460","6782220"," Something that's unknown that's like today."
"6782220","6788920"," If you don't have that on Tesla, this is what my warning goes to you about with Tesla. "
"6790800","6792780"," Awesome to trade up into the event."
"6794640","6799260"," Nine out of 10 times, not worth any position holding through."
"6801660","6806280"," Almost always the best trade is after the next expiring. "
"6807620","6811220"," Here and there you'll get the best trade the following day."
"6812220","6814340"," Like you'll come in to the market."
"6814360","6819500"," There might be a squeeze higher for five minutes at 9.30, but the real trade on Tesla is usually"
"6819500","6825400"," the day after, if not the next expiry after that expiry gets murdered off. "
"6827400","6832760"," But I have held through Tesla ERs, and I have won many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many,"
"6832760","6836340"," many, thousands of dollars on some shit tickets."
"6836740","6840040"," So I guess if you're like, well, I just made like 20 grand this week."
"6840040","6841980"," I'm just going to throw 10 grand at some shit tickets. "
"6843880","6849100"," I don't know, buy some fucking zero-date Lotto puts and some zero-date Lotto calls."
"6849900","6854980"," Load the fuck up way outside the money, but you're talking about a one-in- So I saw the"
"6854980","6859160"," US will continue to communicate to any implications of providing materials?"
"6859680","6863180"," Probably say one-in-20 chance of those hitting something like that."
"6864540","6870220"," We haven't had them hit in a while, so we haven't hit something like that hitting a while. "
"6870620","6875370"," Yeah, you know, I hear that all the time."
"6876370","6880570"," I hear big news every time we come into a Tesla, you have a trade in Tesla ERs for fucking"
"6880570","6881550"," almost a decade."
"6881650","6885030"," So I hear that every fucking ER is going to be big news. "
"6885390","6887750"," So I don't want to say to you on that."
"6887970","6893330"," From my own experience, it's a shot in the dark every time."
"6894710","6900450"," And my most profitable Tesla trades are always leading into ER and after. "
"6900590","6910070"," If you were to take my last Tesla ER trades, last 50 of them, my highest money making has always"
"6910070","6910450"," been."
"6911410","6919650"," As a matter of fact, when there was a Tesla trade I was in where they'd announced the split and"
"6919650","6925370"," the stuff that I held through ER printed at 9.30 in the morning."
"6926970","6929610"," Lost value briefly and then went to the moon. "
"6930250","6936170"," So, you know, I could have still just taken profit and jumped right back in 15 minutes later."
"6937490","6938590"," That's true story."
"6939590","6941690"," So I don't know, I don't say to you on Tesla. "
"6942970","6948370"," You guys have to understand that it's not about you, it's about dealers don't go broke."
"6950230","6954350"," Sometimes they do, but not computers."
"6954530","6956010"," Computers will fuck you. "
"6962510","6971190"," You're talking about needing a second round of buyers to come in for options."
"6971970","6979170"," So let's say the price of Tesla is $145 and it spikes up to 160 on their ER, right?"
"6979170","6982310"," It spikes to 160 on their ER release."
"6983310","6989930"," At 9.30 the next morning people have to believe that it's going higher than let's say 160. "
"6990650","6991150"," Does that make sense?"
"6992090","6995690"," Like you need a whole nother round of people to go, fuck that, we're going to 200 today."
"6996030","6996490"," Does that make sense?"
"6997590","7003330"," So if we're not going to 200 that day the people are like, well, we'll go to 200 but it"
"7003330","7004330"," won't be for two or three more weeks."
"7005050","7010590"," You're going to see all this IV on that next expiry shift to two weeks later. "
"7010810","7011370"," Does that make sense?"
"7012310","7018270"," So when that IV comes off that next expiry you'll see the price of Tesla go down briefly and then"
"7018270","7020610"," swing back higher a week later."
"7021470","7028090"," I know you don't believe me but watch me get proved wrong this ER but if you go back, you"
"7028090","7028970"," should back test this."
"7029490","7033710"," You can go and think of swim, you can go in a trading view I think too and you back"
"7033710","7034230"," test it. "
"7034230","7041270"," Go back and back test E-R-E-R reports and you run it like 20 times and I'll assure"
"7041270","7046890"," you that if you don't trade what I just told you, how you trade, I assure you that you come"
"7046890","7052070"," out as a fucking loser over time because I have, I've come out as a loser over time."
"7052250","7057910"," As a matter of fact, I've won so big on a couple of those ERs but now if I hold"
"7057910","7060390"," a lot of those through them it's just a little bit of money."
"7060630","7062490"," It's like 500 bucks, 1000 bucks. "
"7063670","7068490"," Because I've made so much but it's not like, oh I'm throwing my whole account in this E-R, you"
"7068490","7069270"," can't do that shit."
"7075520","7080220"," It's not that it gets dumped for no apparent reason, it's that it gets dumped because interest on"
"7080220","7085000"," the event leaves and interest in the future leaves and you've got repositioning."
"7085400","7088940"," You've got people that'll be like, oh I don't think we're going up to, let's say hit 160, they're"
"7088940","7091640"," going to be like, well I'm not buying 160 C's the next day. "
"7092220","7096320"," I'm going to buy like month out 190s or something so you see like the herd changes."
"7096840","7099400"," And then you've got dealers that have to take the opposite side of that trade."
"7099920","7105100"," So if I'm like, I'm going to buy a million dollars in 200 C's because this kick ass E-R"
"7105100","7111740"," report for Tesla, I'm not buying this like two day zero dates with a million dollars, I'm going to"
"7111740","7112520"," buy like a month out. "
"7112720","7117860"," And then you've got a dealer that's like, well fuck that guy, I'm going to offset his trade, right?"
"7118080","7125060"," I can't let him win unless he gets more people that think it's going higher, not even 200 to like"
"7125060","7125060"," 220."
"7126720","7127560"," Does that make sense?"
"7127920","7134020"," See there's like this, there's this thing where you need to have this like continuation of higher"
"7134020","7141100"," prices, a belief that we can go higher than 160 to 190 to maybe 200, and you're the film of"
"7141100","7141700"," people kick in."
"7141840","7145000"," So you need all of this to happen, like there's this like rolling effect. "
"7145920","7148820"," And if all that doesn't happen, you're the fucking bag holder."
"7149860","7154340"," Now they might hit that price again a week later they might go like let's say we hit 160 and"
"7154340","7160820"," saw off in the open, then you might see us retrace to 160 one more time like a week or"
"7160820","7162900"," two later, but meanwhile you're fucked in your positioning."
"7164480","7168460"," Meanwhile, you're 160 sees that you were whole, let's say you're being a smart ass and you're like,"
"7168900","7174480"," okay, so I'm not going to buy this next expiry for E-R, I'm going to buy 160 for two"
"7174480","7174900"," weeks later. "
"7175780","7177940"," So you buy your 160s, they're like two weeks dated."
"7178760","7184240"," The other thing that happens is they spike up, they sell off on the open, and then you're looking"
"7184240","7188800"," at your 160s that you bought P4, but you now have less interest in them."
"7188880","7190280"," You've got less holders of it. "
"7190820","7192980"," So the premium is gone from that."
"7193120","7194100"," So you get fucked again."
"7194420","7203440"," So I would say that you trade the lead up, you possibly do some kind of a spread, strangle outside"
"7203440","7209180"," the money with time on it, and you manage that trade on both sides, you can manage each side of"
"7209180","7210660"," the two spreads. "
"7212080","7218200"," Depending on how E-R goes, if you end up getting a surprise, you can cut the sold calls and"
"7218200","7222760"," the bot puts off of that shit and write it up over time."
"7223760","7229860"," So you can manage that trade at least, if something unexpected happens, but just be like, I'm"
"7229860","7231960"," buying fucking calls or I'm buying fucking puts."
"7232840","7233820"," It's not a good bet. "
"7235660","7237100"," It usually doesn't pay."
"7237460","7238680"," Nine times out of ten, it doesn't pay."
"7247240","7249060"," I've traded it too many fucking times. "
"7250740","7251780"," It really has."
"7254780","7258260"," There's a whole bunch of shit you can do, but make sure that you think through your trade."
"7258520","7261760"," If you're going to hold through E-R, think through how you're going to manage it. "
"7261880","7265080"," Like, oh, I'm going to get some put spreads, some call spreads."
"7265340","7271200"," I'm going to date a month out, I don't know, like mid-March or something, and I'm going to manage"
"7271200","7271460"," them."
"7271760","7279720"," So if we get good news, but nothing that's going to change the actual Tesla price over time, you"
"7279720","7283940"," don't have to deal with the interest in spreads, you know what I mean?"
"7284780","7292780"," If the trade goes south on you, you can cut the long call and the in the sold put side"
"7292780","7293300"," of the trade. "
"7295540","7296020"," Right?"
"7296680","7301080"," If you have a swing in price up and down over a couple of weeks, you can probably monetize both"
"7301080","7301500"," sides."
"7302160","7304560"," Take some work to monetize that stuff."
"7309130","7311430"," Oh, oh, oh, we in bear towing now?"
"7313110","7318090"," Yeah, I was, I was fucking, I was uh, I was stopped out right here somewhere. "
"7319570","7321090"," To earn bear towing here."
"7322310","7323850"," We're going down to the repo a lot."
"7328130","7331130"," Good thing it puts some fucking stops on the fucking shit. "
"7332070","7333710"," We'll over here fucking ranting about Tesla."
"7335410","7338890"," Where bears towing promise of Lambo's."
"7339290","7343330"," And we get the repo a lot down below. "
"7346930","7354990"," Oh, yeah."
"7356170","7357310"," Oh, yeah."
"7358390","7358910"," Blood. "
"7358910","7359170"," Blood."
"7361250","7363250"," Bright red blood."
"7364210","7366410"," We want puddles of it down below. "
"7367590","7369150"," We want bulls blood."
"7370190","7376170"," We want the great mythos and fables of the bear father to pay off."
"7379510","7383530"," Let's take a look at, uh, take a look at spy right here. "
"7384430","7386370"," We want to see a rejection above."
"7386610","7388010"," Bears want to just have some work to do."
"7388910","7390650"," Send a necessary congressional lead. "
"7391190","7394230"," 397, 397, 90."
"7395870","7396990"," 397, 90."
"7397710","7399890"," Repo lot is that 397, 90. "
"7403210","7409350"," 397, 0.90. So just remember this number down below."
"7410510","7412430"," 397, 90 down below."
"7413290","7414970"," Bears want to see a rejection above. "
"7418440","7422100"," We want to keep the promise of Lambo's on the screen so the bears can look at that because they"
"7422100","7422740"," love that shit."
"7423900","7426720"," You want to see a rejection here for bears want to see."
"7430000","7434520"," And now I want to see a rejection above and then I move lower to the bear repo a lot. "
"7438220","7439640"," Just keep your eyes on it here."
"7439820","7444040"," Get the first first first break of the one minute and the five minute."
"7444040","7445800"," This is this is good for bears. "
"7453920","7455140"," Oh, yeah, bears."
"7461610","7462290"," Blood red."
"7466710","7467370"," Bear plumbing. "
"7468130","7469110"," How may I serve you?"
"7470830","7472930"," Let's see if we can get a rejection above on the one minute."
"7473170","7475630"," Confirm the move down to 397, 90."
"7486580","7487200"," There's hello. "
"7489740","7491280"," My pipes are clogged."
"7491820","7495880"," Oh, this is bear plumbing."
"7496100","7496720"," How may I help you?"
"7497120","7497700"," I need a rotor. "
"7497920","7498420"," I need a rotor."
"7498680","7501660"," I have to think about that one before I start that one."
"7502200","7511340"," You want the full service ma'am?"
"7512160","7514160"," My husband the bull's gone right now. "
"7516000","7517460"," The pipes are clogged."
"7522280","7524540"," I'll send a couple of boys over to take care of you."
"7526360","7527520"," Does he have work ma'am?"
"7527820","7529360"," He's over at Wendy's working. "
"7529600","7533220"," Please save off people until at least early June."
"7533780","7536700"," He promised to kill them, but he hasn't gotten it for me yet."
"7543520","7544800"," We'll change this to bear. "
"7544980","7546320"," We'll change this to bear plumbing."
"7551620","7552800"," Bear plumbing service."
"7560380","7561700"," This is terrible. "
"7563080","7564480"," We'll do this down here."
"7564520","7565480"," We'll change this to a."
"7567540","7569000"," We'll change this to a house call."
"7573780","7576020"," We'll make this a house call down below. "
"7580720","7583640"," We'll see if the bears can hold the one minute here."
"7585960","7587560"," Bears man, you got a salbro."
"7589240","7590820"," Bears haven't sold shit. "
"7594320","7596380"," Bears need to be selling over here."
"7598300","7600920"," We need to put some emphasis and conviction into it."
"7601560","7603780"," Bear plumbing better be paying for the ad service. "
"7604900","7606240"," Can't be doing a shitty job."
"7606800","7607860"," Rotor-rotoring the pipes."
"7612600","7616600"," Need to hire some call center people. "
"7617380","7622380"," Calling some people up on the phone while they're eating dinner on a other TV dinners in front of a"
"7622380","7623120"," TV or something."
"7630620","7635340"," That's the S&B balance she doesn't only grow and can also shrink."
"7637600","7639280"," I'm still buyers here. "
"7639880","7641320"," It's a good dip by over here."
"7647540","7649120"," It's a really good dip by."
"7650880","7653400"," Good buyers are here in force. "
"7654760","7655840"," Just looking for some liquidity."
"7656560","7659240"," Look at that, baby."
"7664160","7666180"," The bull's not fucking around here. "
"7670340","7671620"," That's a trap, huh?"
"7673720","7675800"," Well, there's some pain, right?"
"7676000","7678660"," There's some stops getting triggered right in here, for sure."
"7687800","7688880"," The lambos."
"7691890","7693550"," Oof, that hurt right there. "
"7694470","7699770"," For any of you guys and puts down here, there's no way that that felt good."
"7700590","7706880"," Oh, man, there ain't no way that felt good."
"7708380","7709940"," Bear's like, give me one red candle. "
"7710940","7712520"," Just let me unfuck myself down here."
"7715090","7716910"," Hopefully you had some stops up here."
"7717690","7718230"," Took the money. "
"7719750","7721190"," Did you have stops up here?"
"7723710","7724670"," My God."
"7724670","7730690"," I got wrecked in there if you were a put holder and didn't have stops."
"7733710","7734210"," Oof. "
"7735510","7735890"," Oof."
"7737590","7739190"," Dude, no follow through."
"7740130","7742470"," That's a bear trap I ever saw one right there. "
"7744670","7745910"," My, look at that."
"7747830","7748330"," Brutal."
"7750430","7754190"," I guess you could try to say that, I guess you could try to say that. "
"7755270","7757630"," Uh, their stops were higher, I guess."
"7758090","7762670"," I guess you could, you could attempt to be like, yeah, this is where we're short cap."
"7764550","7766870"," I don't know though, I don't know if I trust that. "
"7768290","7772470"," You could, I guess bears could say they were short here, they were short here, and now they're"
"7772470","7773130"," short here."
"7775050","7775790"," We'll see, man."
"7778110","7780850"," I don't like, I don't like being above this blue line. "
"7781890","7783570"," Unless they're teen off from up high."
"7785090","7786710"," I'm not buying it right now."
"7787650","7789510"," This is looking like a squeeze coming up. "
"7796680","7797920"," I'm long right here."
"7798360","7800040"," I'm not buying this bullshit right here."
"7805200","7806480"," Where's that higher high?"
"7811820","7812120"," Right there. "
"7819660","7820820"," I'm long again."
"7825660","7828480"," Man, bears really did want this right here."
"7828600","7832800"," Bears, so bears wanted to get under here, right, and trap some bulls. "
"7833200","7835360"," Even if it was up here, they wanted to trap some bulls."
"7837920","7844840"," You don't want to see the break above the one minute here, so this is not good for bears."
"7845940","7847660"," Something like this, not bad. "
"7848260","7851440"," I'll give you like to this line right here, I'll give you to this line right here."
"7851960","7853280"," But that was no bueno."
"7853660","7854440"," That was a bear trap. "
"7857620","7858860"," Or so far it is."
"7860680","7862320"," No follow through right here."
"7865580","7866620"," Min 401c's. "
"7875490","7878450"," Man, that was a trap and a half right there."
"7879270","7880430"," You guys can see that, right?"
"7880630","7888420"," You want to see like, you want to see that, that's cell, that initial cell, right?"
"7888720","7891360"," You want to see trapping bulls right here."
"7893620","7900240"," And then the move down, or you'd want to see like, down here, down here, and then the cell down"
"7900240","7900540"," here. "
"7900700","7901820"," Not seeing that right there."
"7902620","7903780"," Fucking, we're going the other way."
"7907320","7908720"," With a bear trap right there. "
"7910580","7911580"," Son of a bitch."
"7913860","7914920"," So far it is."
"7918430","7920270"," Now trading 70 cents on calls. "
"7922230","7924270"," We got the promise of lambos here."
"7927430","7932050"," I guess to put it above these two up this high, and this high right here."
"7937030","7938870"," Wild action in the market right now. "
"7939850","7942570"," I know it's sideways, but still wild action."
"7943450","7944570"," No follow through from bears."
"7946770","7947250"," None. "
"7948630","7950270"," Been trending up all day long."
"7950550","7952850"," When you look at that, just grinding higher all day long."
"7953970","7956210"," Dip was bought, bought it, brought it back down. "
"7956210","7957210"," Come down here."
"7957790","7958830"," You see it, right?"
"7961810","7964950"," You might say it's sideways action, but it's not."
"7965290","7968090"," It was dip was bought, came back down. "
"7968790","7969850"," A little bit of liquidity."
"7970650","7972050"," Trying to make a move higher right now."
"7974010","7974530"," Huge. "
"7976810","7980270"," You really wanted to see like, boom, right?"
"7980570","7981070"," Just like this."
"7981910","7985490"," You really wanted to see like, the bears take right over right here."
"7985610","7986790"," They wanted to sell this down. "
"7987910","7991290"," Get underneath, get underneath, and rocket ship this down."
"7995660","7996580"," Didn't happen."
"8007360","8017360"," Man, bears, plumbing services down here. "
"8020300","8027780"," I'll cut my lungs if we get underneath this blue and green again, but if we don't, I'm a."
"8032460","8035640"," Yeah, I think it's, I think it's 403 or 403."
"8036200","8037860"," I think 403."
"8038740","8048400"," My buddy is saying he thinks 403 or 403 or 63 or something. "
"8049200","8050380"," 403 and low change."
"8058200","8059880"," 403 works in safety."
"8063720","8070280"," Yeah, so my buddy is saying to me right now that he thinks that 402 is top. "
"8071360","8072300"," Oh, that's what I got."
"8072580","8073060"," 40265."
"8074200","8075640"," I got the same fucking number. "
"8076460","8076940"," My bad."
"8077160","8077520"," Rumorong."
"8077700","8078040"," My bad. "
"8080100","8083120"," I have 40265."
"8087970","8088450"," 65."
"8091050","8092090"," We are the same. "
"8093270","8094370"," Do we are the same?"
"8104410","8105170"," Oh, say an error."
"8106590","8107910"," Dude, my phone just died."
"8108370","8108630"," Damn it. "
"8109710","8110730"," Phone just died."
"8111390","8112770"," Yeah, so we're both on the same page."
"8112770","8116030"," The buddy of mine are like, I was like, I got 403 but I don't. "
"8116110","8117510"," I've got 40265."
"8119130","8123970"," So maybe he or he, I think he's saying that he thinks that we'll have a failure for 40265."
"8124510","8127410"," So we'll put his, as a guy that I trust. "
"8128830","8131090"," He thinks we'll have a failure to hit."
"8132750","8135590"," Previous day highs up here, he thinks we'll have a failure up here at 402."
"8137430","8139070"," So we'll put a yellow box above here. "
"8141550","8142330"," Right at 402."
"8143550","8145410"," A promise of Lambo's here."
"8147350","8150710"," Previous day high, we'll put this in white so that you can see it. "
"8151630","8153310"," This is also a price target."
"8161980","8162640"," Right here."
"8164240","8166200"," He thinks we'll only hit 402. "
"8166820","8169280"," So I think we'll hit 402265 or a failure at least."
"8170200","8171260"," You know, some kind of nonsense."
"8171480","8174000"," I think we're going up here and then maybe we fail it. "
"8174880","8175860"," Something like that."
"8175860","8176980"," Something like that, right?"
"8177300","8177760"," Directionally at least."
"8178100","8180320"," He seems to think that we'll only get 402. "
"8181160","8183440"," We'll get up here and fail to even get that."
"8191740","8193240"," Getting a little long in the tooth."
"8196780","8202010"," Yeah, these aren't moving averages. "
"8202650","8210590"," I try to adjust them each day on EMA's so that you can have a fair approximation, but they change"
"8210590","8211209"," every day."
"8211209","8215410"," I have them on a Python script on trading view."
"8217070","8223510"," You can't write them on Weebles, so I try to do a rough approximation each day. "
"8252360","8254280"," Yeah, I'm in 401s."
"8255980","8259080"," We say yesterday we gave a price target of 404."
"8259080","8262059"," We're going to look at a 5-day chart real quick. "
"8262180","8263360"," I want to talk to you if you're a bull."
"8264600","8266660"," And we're going to have a little conversation here, okay?"
"8267320","8274920"," So if you're a bull, I don't know if you're in spreads or if you're in, I don't know if"
"8274920","8275559"," you're in spreads."
"8277320","8282780"," I want you to pay attention to this if you're a bull, okay?"
"8287139","8288959"," Pay attention if you're a bull. "
"8290299","8297780"," I don't know how far danger calls are when they're going to end or whatever, but I want you to"
"8297780","8298600"," pay attention, okay?"
"8301760","8303240"," So come up here, right?"
"8303860","8305040"," I'm down here, right?"
"8305240","8306559"," This is not rocket science, right?"
"8307500","8308299"," I'm up here, right?"
"8309420","8310020"," I'm up here."
"8310320","8314260"," I don't know if it's now, if it's Friday, whatever is up here today."
"8314459","8316400"," I don't know, right?"
"8317379","8318959"," Probably not going to get up there. "
"8319080","8320700"," You're probably going to get a failure in here."
"8321020","8321459"," You see that?"
"8322540","8324660"," So I'm not even trying to get that high."
"8324760","8326440"," I'm trying to get just to here, okay?"
"8327860","8332080"," Failure to get a new high, right?"
"8332379","8333719"," Something like that, maybe. "
"8335299","8336299"," Just be aware."
"8336840","8337639"," Take the money and run."
"8338180","8340000"," Take the money and run. "
"8340840","8342480"," Take the money and run."
"8343360","8347540"," Look for a place to buy a dip."
"8348100","8348559"," Makes sense?"
"8349860","8350400"," Buy a dip. "
"8352980","8354559"," If you get something like this."
"8356340","8358260"," Bullish if we hold this, right?"
"8359700","8360760"," Later in the week."
"8362080","8362700"," Bullish. "
"8372080","8373139"," Still bullish."
"8384110","8386850"," Hey, Cap, I just bought calls here."
"8388090","8390690"," For Friday, doesn't make sense, does it?"
"8392690","8394590"," Buy calls for Friday here. "
"8395050","8396310"," Buy calls for Friday here."
"8397670","8398910"," Take the money and run."
"8399390","8400450"," Take the money and run. "
"8400830","8401170"," Makes sense."
"8404470","8406290"," Take the money and run at some point."
"8407410","8408250"," Does all that make sense?"
"8410110","8412190"," Failure to make a new high back here, maybe. "
"8413710","8415150"," Start the roll over."
"8416690","8418230"," Is that all clear to you?"
"8425340","8427060"," Look for the roll above."
"8429080","8430340"," Fire time frame. "
"8432900","8433560"," Squeeze up."
"8433700","8434420"," Take the money and run."
"8434960","8435760"," Sit on your hands. "
"8438420","8438900"," Right?"
"8439200","8441020"," See the big blue line come up right here."
"8441140","8443160"," Big blue line comes up here, hopefully."
"8444420","8445400"," Takes us higher. "
"8446820","8447320"," Squeeze higher."
"8447620","8448940"," Take your money and get out of here."
"8449340","8449680"," Makes sense?"
"8454320","8456440"," There's plumbing service waiting below for you. "
"8458040","8463710"," I probably got some bears already buying puts for Friday and saying, oh, fuck it, I don't care."
"8465270","8467030"," I wouldn't doubt that at all."
"8467570","8468430"," Let's look around the market. "
"8468590","8469310"," Let's look at NDX."
"8470030","8471190"," Two NDXs is doing."
"8474170","8476010"," We got Microsoft coming up too. "
"8478590","8484450"," Got a house call over here, $397.90. Got bears plumbing service over here just waiting."
"8492270","8494550"," There's looking for a failure to get a new high."
"8497090","8498970"," Promise of lambos for the bulls. "
"8508650","8509990"," There's trying to send it."
"8510690","8511890"," There's the like, send it."
"8520020","8525000"," You got a Look map over there. "
"8530960","8535460"," There's a previous high target failure to hit the new high over here."
"8536100","8536920"," Promise of lambos."
"8538120","8539700"," Sweet talk and a bullet is there. "
"8541060","8542120"," Telling them we're going higher."
"8544280","8546260"," Tell me the stock market doesn't just go up."
"8548520","8550640"," We'll get there just not being your time frame. "
"8555000","8557760"," We'll look around different sectors right now."
"8558580","8559300"," Look at some sectors."
"8560600","8562240"," HYG holding it up pretty good. "
"8564060","8565100"," Look around the market."
"8566180","8566880"," Eight minute."
"8567500","8571360"," I haven't checked the HYG in a while. "
"8575890","8577270"," At least this is trying to happen."
"8592020","8593080"," Check the one hour."
"8600790","8602010"," Move this down somewhere. "
"8606610","8608590"," Okay, we got back here."
"8608590","8609330"," Sold it up."
"8609610","8610130"," Check it down. "
"8610970","8612490"," Getting crispy over here."
"8613470","8614610"," Seller stepping in."
"8616030","8617490"," I've got a gap down below. "
"8625310","8626390"," Buyer stepped in."
"8626530","8627350"," Buyer stepped in."
"8628410","8630010"," We know we got some sellers above. "
"8638600","8639660"," See, sold it."
"8640540","8640880"," Buyers."
"8641800","8643080"," Hourly shifting a little bit. "
"8648130","8650030"," If we get that rip higher to 403."
"8651110","8653030"," We just start selling it down."
"8654470","8656870"," We had some buyers step in right here. "
"8664720","8665660"," Buyers right here."
"8666060","8666900"," Buyers right here."
"8668320","8669260"," Yeah, Phil. "
"8671880","8673360"," I don't believe that's real."
"8673860","8676000"," I think that's just the same people right here."
"8703310","8704150"," Bought it up. "
"8704750","8705550"," Came back down."
"8705730","8706490"," They bought it up again."
"8707770","8709030"," Came back down. "
"8709370","8709950"," Buyed it up."
"8711370","8714410"," Start selling it down into HYG."
"8715310","8716890"," Ah, it's kind of bullish. "
"8717770","8719490"," Looks more like distribution though."
"8723630","8729020"," Vicks left the gap."
"8731620","8733400"," We close this gap down here. "
"8734480","8735740"," Still looking a little slightly bullish."
"8737740","8738820"," Something like that."
"8738820","8740420"," Close this gap down below. "
"8744010","8745110"," Buyers looking kind of bullish."
"8745910","8746390"," XLP."
"8746870","8764350"," A little bit"
"8764350","8765630"," of room to go up and then more selling. "
"8768170","8771750"," Like to see XLP come up here and then reverse off down here."
"8775870","8776350"," XLY."
"8786420","8788780"," Rate where first sellers were right here. "
"8788920","8789420"," You can see them."
"8791120","8792880"," So why holding up nicely?"
"8794780","8797920"," You can see the sellers came in and sold right here."
"8798360","8807220"," A little selling, selling, selling. "
"8807940","8808580"," People are panicking."
"8812280","8814420"," These are pretty much buyers now."
"8821660","8823520"," The sellers are weakening here. "
"8850090","8850610"," XLC."
"8851530","8852310"," Oh yeah, baby."
"8852550","8852870"," Look at that. "
"8854590","8856670"," Fucking look at that move for XLC."
"8857590","8860190"," Came up, sold down, came straight up."
"8860590","8861370"," This is the first brick. "
"8861610","8862710"," They breed these sellers here."
"8863970","8864970"," They got these sellers here."
"8865190","8868150"," Probably grind in here a little bit and then make it move up. "
"8868450","8871410"," This could be some sideways moving for XLC."
"8873910","8876510"," Next stop 5.57 bucks."
"8877450","8878510"," It's a nice move. "
"8884360","8885200"," Sold down."
"8885500","8886160"," Fought to be back up."
"8886360","8886620"," Told no. "
"8887520","8887880"," Came up here."
"8888660","8889780"," No, no, no."
"8890000","8890500"," Push back up. "
"8890740","8890820"," Damn."
"8891460","8893360"," XLK is about to fucking explode higher."
"8897870","8900810"," And XLK is super bullish. "
"8903310","8904770"," Next tag above there."
"8906410","8907550"," Sold it up here."
"8909790","8910610"," Buyers right there. "
"8913640","8915780"," XLK, man, looks real nice here."
"8916700","8917500"," Real nice."
"8930020","8931180"," XLK is rippy. "
"8933600","8935660"," As that guy says, I've been to it."
"8941980","8942620"," Bullish."
"8943620","8944980"," This is bullish, man. "
"8946380","8948140"," Technology sector bullish as fuck."
"8957280","8957800"," XLF."
"8960160","8961360"," Beaten the levels here. "
"8963140","8963660"," Sold."
"8965260","8966640"," More support sold."
"8967080","8969840"," Dude, XLF is, we got fucking the rest of this week. "
"8970000","8972140"," We've got a regional banks, man."
"8972420","8974320"," And they're gonna fucking try to push this up."
"8975040","8976580"," The $37.52 guaranteed. "
"8979760","8981420"," This is turning into support right here."
"8982440","8982680"," Bullish."
"8987410","8989090"," Let's look back in time and see. "
"8990250","8991770"," $37.50 right here."
"8995480","8998640"," Sell, sell, and bag holders."
"8999100","9003560"," $37.52 for a price target on XLF. "
"9004440","9004960"," XLU."
"9005740","9006800"," Oh, look at that."
"9008640","9009940"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"9010260","9011360"," That's what you want to see right there."
"9011880","9012420"," Oh, yeah."
"9013060","9014860"," Dude, I love coming back and checking this shit. "
"9016220","9017160"," Oh, yeah."
"9017160","9018760"," That's what I want to see right there."
"9021060","9022100"," Oh, man. "
"9024000","9024900"," Just like that."
"9025300","9026040"," That's what I want to see."
"9027760","9028500"," Tell me. "
"9030140","9031820"," I'm just from resistance here."
"9032120","9033000"," Let's look at XLB."
"9041220","9043540"," Daily chart says it's bullish here. "
"9047290","9049070"," It's where these sellers are here."
"9049970","9051110"," All right, push it up."
"9051590","9052510"," Got caught in it, right?"
"9053310","9056870"," If it came back up here, get rid of the sellers, get rid of the sellers. "
"9057350","9058350"," I don't know."
"9058510","9059970"," I'd like to see XLB trade sideways."
"9061510","9066370"," This could seem like it's bullish, but I don't think that it is. "
"9077450","9078530"," How can XLB?"
"9079350","9080730"," That's a daily chart, dude."
"9080930","9081290"," Weekly chart?"
"9081710","9082450"," Yeah, fuck that noise."
"9083710","9084410"," XLB, man. "
"9085430","9086570"," Shit's like sell, sell, sell."
"9087270","9088210"," It says that it's not."
"9088870","9090590"," And weekly, it's really supportive here. "
"9090590","9091190"," You see this weekly."
"9092170","9093570"," How supportive that is."
"9095090","9098640"," I'm going to change that out. "
"9099940","9103260"," Put that there, and I'll give you something."
"9103780","9112540"," If XLB sells down to like 70 bucks, maybe you see something like this kind of nonsense."
"9113400","9115020"," Goes back down for some more support. "
"9136220","9136860"," Accelerate."
"9137200","9138240"," I'm bullish on XLB."
"9139440","9142080"," I'm bullish on XLB because of that. "
"9142120","9142340"," Look at that."
"9142440","9143300"," It's broken out, dude."
"9143680","9144880"," Solar is broken out. "
"9145800","9147520"," Bullishes fuck on XLB."
"9148120","9149000"," Because of rentals."
"9152180","9152800"," Bill. "
"9157190","9158590"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"9158750","9159190"," Look at that."
"9160610","9163030"," Look at that fucking purple line. "
"9165150","9166550"," Bam, bam."
"9167070","9168350"," Tag it right here."
"9169210","9169670"," See that?"
"9169810","9170490"," Almost to a T."
"9172090","9174490"," Oh, previous low right here. "
"9176090","9179610"," $1.99. $1.11.99. Almost to a T."
"9180330","9181910"," Maybe a little roll over here."
"9183470","9184690"," Dude, fucking bill."
"9185550","9186750"," Goddamn, that was a good trade. "
"9192160","9195100"," SPX, look at that GPM caller up there."
"9196340","9196940"," 4060."
"9198280","9199060"," Look at NDX. "
"9207860","9208500"," Oh, no."
"9208660","9210440"," What's this NDLS my ass?"
"9210600","9211540"," NDX, baby."
"9215620","9217480"," Oh, with a giant gap above. "
"9218860","9220580"," hourly still screaming higher."
"9221120","9223060"," I mean, this is showing some weakness on the hourly."
"9225700","9227200"," Spy is not showing that. "
"9227380","9228900"," The five minutes, some weakness here."
"9229580","9231440"," We could get a pullback here in NDX."
"9233280","9234280"," The trade higher. "
"9234880","9236960"," See the buyers in here on the 24th."
"9237340","9238360"," See what happened here."
"9240780","9242940"," And NASDAQ's looking a little weak here. "
"9243620","9244880"," Like losing some steam."
"9246280","9248120"," 15 minute, losing some steam."
"9250920","9252880"," One minute, losing some steam. "
"9254080","9256620"," I mean, spies looking like it's going up, but NDX isn't."
"9257300","9259300"," NDX is looking a little, little toppy."
"9263860","9266400"," So NASDAQ's looking sickly at this point. "
"9268240","9270280"," So Apple's looking a little sickly here."
"9273660","9278460"," Tesla's kind of doing its thing, but NASDAQ's looking a little weak right here."
"9278620","9279460"," What's XLE doing?"
"9283140","9285000"," XLE holding the whole fucking market up. "
"9285240","9286520"," That's what I was wondering about XLE."
"9286680","9289480"," I'm like, this shit's got to be holding the market up right now."
"9290140","9291720"," It's got to be fucking something, right?"
"9292160","9292700"," It's XLE. "
"9292960","9295080"," XLE is holding the entire fucking market up right now."
"9295080","9305040"," So there's trying to"
"9305040","9305400"," get underneath."
"9313960","9315120"," It's like sideways, right?"
"9315300","9316400"," Is that what it's reminding you of?"
"9319890","9320710"," Let me know what you think. "
"9320790","9323930"," Let me know in the chat what you're seeing, because you just blew through all that stuff with me."
"9324110","9326090"," So SPX isn't looking that sick."
"9326770","9329950"," SPX looks maybe like pause. "
"9332270","9334310"," NASDAQ is looking a little toppy right now."
"9334310","9338690"," NASDAQ has had a few drinks, spent a long week."
"9339650","9340530"," They need a break. "
"9343250","9344290"," I'm like, oh, everything's fine."
"9344430","9345750"," SPX, where is the problem?"
"9346030","9346650"," What's holding it up?"
"9347910","9349170"," And it's fucking energy."
"9357330","9359410"," Yeah, so I'm probably going to pull the plug here. "
"9371820","9374900"," I've got to stop now."
"9378860","9386480"," I got to stop for down here."
"9386760","9392800"," So if we start selling down here, I'm probably going to figure out here in just a minute. "
"9393180","9393500"," I'm close."
"9396960","9399720"," It's like one of those lazy, it's looking like a lazy afternoon."
"9401500","9403580"," What I'm probably going to do is take a break here. "
"9404900","9406820"," I'm going to grab a sandwich or something."
"9407460","9413760"," I've got a house called down below $3.97.60. We've got bear plumbing service just waiting for"
"9416140","9418320"," waiting for the bulls trying to steam."
"9419220","9421200"," NASDAQ's looking like it needs some consolidation. "
"9423300","9424800"," Oh, we got this bad boy down here."
"9426540","9428480"," This is the house call, right?"
"9429600","9432580"," The price on SPY 39791."
"9434900","9438340"," Let's look below and 39416. "
"9442160","9444440"," I'm going to write some targets down below."
"9444540","9448220"," I don't know if we get down here, but bears are hoping."
"9449140","9455360"," We got the house call at 3970 and then your wife left you. "
"9457660","9459720"," Your wife left you is down below."
"9462200","9464860"," I probably shouldn't be doing this on live streams."
"9466620","9467980"," Your wife left you. "
"9468140","9468700"," It's down here."
"9472020","9474700"," So bulls need a shot of coffee or something."
"9482730","9484290"," Here's our one above here. "
"9486090","9489910"," I've got a limit on some calls here now."
"9492790","9496230"," So regardless, so where we are right now is regardless of what I'm going to tell you."
"9497530","9500370"," If you're a bull, we can get up here and take some money. "
"9501130","9502970"," I just sit on your hands if we get up here."
"9503190","9503970"," Take the money and run."
"9505570","9512610"," Bears are probably setting up to enter the market here, or they're trying right now to enter to put"
"9512610","9513370"," a short on the market. "
"9514170","9517570"," Now if we peter out of steam and just start rolling over down here, you've got to have a stop"
"9517570","9518190"," loss, okay?"
"9518750","9519450"," If you're a bull."
"9521370","9524830"," So like have that have that limits limits down below here."
"9525870","9527590"," And I'm going to say a quick break. "
"9527850","9528410"," I'll be right back."
"9528610","9530090"," It's 1238."
"9531390","9532350"," It's 1238. "
"9532630","9534090"," You guys have some targets down below."
"9534610","9535870"," I'm going to leave the live stream up of course."
"9538170","9544090"," And just take a quick break because I have a feeling that we're losing some steam here. "
"9548180","9549120"," All right, there we go."
"9551040","9552020"," So I'll leave that up for you."
"9552300","9553700"," Keep your eyes on the market right now. "
"9554820","9556420"," Yeah, my wife's packing her bags."
"9557020","9558980"," I lost my wife, my kids, my two dogs."
"9561920","9564140"," One of those goddamn dogs isn't mine though. "
"9567300","9569880"," Have this like running jokes since I got that dog."
"9570980","9572280"," That he's not mine, he's the kids."
"9574300","9576580"," But I think he loves me more than the dog that's mine. "
"9579980","9583720"," So I'll like I'll pretend like publicly that I don't like them."
"9583800","9585580"," And then when nobody's around, I'm like, come on over here."
"9585660","9588120"," I'll give you a drumstick, like a chicken drumstick. "
"9588780","9589540"," Don't tell anybody."
"9589800","9590380"," I love you that much."
"9595060","9599880"," They were going to kill him at the donate to a dog shelter and they were going to kill his"
"9599880","9600060"," ass. "
"9602720","9605820"," He went through a traumatic experience and I didn't want him to die."
"9605820","9607700"," And they knew that I would take his ass."
"9610280","9612120"," No kill shelter and they're going to have to kill him. "
"9619040","9626980"," Yeah, he was the, so one of my dogs, I've got a border collie and that I paid a lot"
"9626980","9630200"," of money for and then an Australian shepherd."
"9630960","9639660"," And the Aussie shepherd was a man owned him and the guy died in his house."
"9642580","9645720"," And the dog was locked inside the house with the guy. "
"9649020","9654660"," And they didn't find the man for some time period."
"9654660","9661220"," And so they brought the dog to a shelter and these shelters, like a bunch of hippies, that damn"
"9661220","9663660"," dirty ass hippies, like a hippie shelter."
"9665100","9672360"," And I donate to this shelter and normally they're no kill, but this one, they had such a stigma to"
"9672360","9672780"," the dog. "
"9673780","9676480"," And for some reason they want to tell everybody what happened."
"9677800","9683100"," So the dog was probably eating his owner and shit and they were going to put him down."
"9683100","9690800"," And he was really hyper and stuff and I needed to run and be exercised and need lots of attention. "
"9691360","9697220"," And the sad part is that this dog had some emotional damage from the experience."
"9698360","9702220"," So you can't, or you can leave him alone, but when you leave him alone, you have to put him"
"9702220","9707420"," in the cage or kind of him so that he feels safe because he really cries."
"9707820","9711440"," If he has like a detachment problems, like they're never coming back. "
"9712280","9713660"," They just left right now."
"9715220","9719300"," So he'll go get my border calling and be like, they left, they're never coming back, they don't"
"9719300","9719760"," love us."
"9722620","9729600"," You know, so like, you know, that kind of shit. "
"9729840","9738180"," So I took him, that's the second dog, and he's wild, like he'll, it's not wild, but"
"9738180","9744420"," you know, like he likes to run away and he likes to kill small animals and shit."
"9744980","9752120"," He likes to kill like rats, squirts, coyotes, likes to kill coyotes out in the middle of the"
"9752120","9752420"," desert."
"9754860","9759500"," Well, he likes the cat that we have, but he loves to love. "
"9759720","9764080"," He's a hunter, but he's a, he's a, he's a wimp too."
"9764080","9768760"," Like, if he ever meets like a large animal, he's very beta."
"9769940","9771000"," He's like, I'm cool, man. "
"9771060","9771360"," I'm cool."
"9771800","9772340"," I'm just a lover."
"9772560","9773080"," I'm not a hater. "
"9775840","9779280"," Then if he sees like a coyote, he's like, I'm going to go out there and fuck that coyote up."
"9779540","9780760"," And I'm like, what are you doing, man?"
"9780880","9782300"," I'm like, why are you fucking with coyotes?"
"9783320","9788780"," I'm like, some big dog comes around and you're just like, you want to, you want to lick my, you"
"9788780","9790760"," know, like tight lick your ass, kind of lick your balls."
"9792400","9795180"," You want to jump on behind me and do your thing, go right ahead. "
"9797260","9798480"," Oh, there you go, buddy."
"9798940","9799880"," What's he talking about?"
"9800040","9803520"," He's talking about him."
"9803520","9804000"," He's here now. "
"9804140","9805460"," He knows I'm talking about him."
"9806820","9808140"," He just came in my office."
"9811760","9813920"," So he acts like he's a bigger dog than he actually is. "
"9820560","9821900"," And that's what it is."
"9825880","9827060"," Yeah, heavy trauma."
"9827060","9828760"," He experienced some heavy, heavy, heavy trauma. "
"9830920","9832860"," Yeah, like that's what cattle dogs are like, right?"
"9834880","9839580"," He's like, it's weird because my border collie would never fight anything."
"9840140","9841180"," My border collie is really weird."
"9841180","9844120"," What he would do is try to stop a fight. "
"9844500","9845520"," He's like, I'll step in the middle."
"9846260","9849540"," He's like, I'll step right in the middle and I'll stop this bigger dog or this bear."
"9849940","9851500"," You know, I'll die for that bear. "
"9851680","9853780"," I'll like, I'll let that bear kill me, but I won't attack the bear."
"9854040","9856660"," I'll just jump in between you and the bear and try to, I'll save your ass."
"9858120","9862780"," Whereas like the border collie or the, the Ozzy Shepherd will be like, fuck this, I'm out of here. "
"9864120","9865560"," I'm going to go kill a coyote."
"9867600","9869840"," And the border collie was, the border collie is loyal."
"9870120","9873560"," Like the border collie is like, stay in this area over here, don't move. "
"9874980","9878320"," If anybody attacks you, I'll jump in the middle, but I'm not going to try to kill it."
"9878480","9879880"," I'm just going to try to stop the attack."
"9881260","9885600"," So two completely different personalities on these dogs. "
"9886440","9890440"," We're getting a little bearish here, a little bearish in the room."
"9890440","9894680"," Oh, yeah, yeah."
"9894900","9903100"," So we used to live out in the desert and we'd have like packs of coyotes, like go out the"
"9903100","9906100"," desert for the mountain or the high, you'd call it the high plains. "
"9906720","9909420"," We lived in the, the high desert plains."
"9909700","9915100"," So we lived nine, 10,000 feet above sea level by the Santa Cristo Mountains."
"9916460","9922960"," And so you had the mountains, but you'd have big trails and you'd have packs of coyotes, like"
"9922960","9924020"," hundreds of them. "
"9924220","9933420"," And if you've got an Ozzy Shepherd, they, like, Ozzy Shepherds are like, they're, they're badasses."
"9933760","9938980"," Ozzy Shepherd is like kind of dog that'll be like, he'll go run outside and be like, I'm going to"
"9938980","9940480"," go play with the coyotes for a little while."
"9940900","9942560"," And the coyotes will be in a pack over the hill. "
"9942560","9948140"," The rolling hills and the coyotes will be like, they'll be out there by themselves, like two or"
"9948140","9949580"," three of them and they'll play with your dog."
"9950460","9954180"," And they'll try to lure your dog over the, over the hill to his pack."
"9954620","9957940"," And then the pack will come out and take them, right, and kill them. "
"9962480","9964840"," And Ozzy Shepherds aren't having none of that."
"9965400","9967420"," Ozzy Shepherd will be like, yeah, I'll come play with you."
"9968060","9969040"," Let me come out there and play with you. "
"9969040","9970920"," And so like the coyotes are like, fuck yeah, come on over and play."
"9971480","9976120"," And then before you know it, the fucking, the Ozzy Shepherd's ripping the stomach out of a coyote"
"9976120","9978500"," in the middle of the side of the hill, you know."
"9979860","9982040"," Ozzy Shepherds are some badass fucking dogs. "
"9982680","9984720"," Like blue healers, any of those kind of cattle dogs."
"9986420","9991300"," It's like, like border, border collie is pretty much, not always, you'll see a border collie"
"9991300","9991840"," working cattle."
"9992580","9998720"," But a lot of border collie work is like sheep and alpaca, like medium sized animals. "
"9998720","10000680"," But like you see a cattle dog out there?"
"10000940","10003220"," They'll look sometimes smaller than a border collie."
"10003520","10005920"," But dude, they will, they will fuck some shit up."
"10009940","10012380"," They will fuck up, they will fuck some shit up. "
"10015700","10017760"," Like dude, I got all kinds of stories for you."
"10017800","10019420"," It's like, we were raising chickens."
"10021620","10024700"," And my, my, my border collie will protect the chickens. "
"10025080","10026760"," He's like, those are the chickens don't fuck with them."
"10027920","10032100"," But if my, if my border collie is in the house, well, we don't have any chickens anymore, we used"
"10032100","10032480"," to have them."
"10032880","10038460"," And so we, so the, so you, it was fine if you had the border collie and the Ozzy Shepherd"
"10038460","10040540"," outside together with the chickens. "
"10040540","10045620"," But if you brought the border collie inside and left the Ozzy Shepherd outside, you'd see him like"
"10045620","10048780"," walking about rocking the backyard with a chicken in his mouth."
"10049360","10050960"," He'd be like, what are you doing, dude?"
"10051560","10052100"," What are you doing?"
"10052100","10052860"," He's like, I'm eating."
"10054320","10057220"," I got to protect the flock from the, from the coyotes. "
"10057800","10059560"," And I'm like, you're just like the coyotes."
"10060900","10061800"," What are you doing?"
"10075180","10076960"," Get out of no, no FSU."
"10077100","10079020"," I was living out in the Santa Cristo Mountains. "
"10079020","10082800"," See if you guys can look that up where it's Southern Colorado, Northern New Mexico."
"10086220","10087280"," I got some cool pictures."
"10087420","10088560"," You guys want to see some cool pictures?"
"10090040","10092300"," I got some cool ass pictures. "
"10093520","10094300"," Hold on a second."
"10096260","10099120"," You want to see me like, snipping bowls balls and branding bowls?"
"10099920","10101460"," Dude, you want to, you want to see some cool pictures?"
"10101760","10102280"," I got some pictures."
"10103820","10108480"," So when you went to my family has a ranch, right?"
"10108480","10110600"," And I'll show you some pictures. "
"10112140","10113520"," They get a big ass ranch."
"10114280","10120060"," And you usually brand calves when they're young, when they can't buck you up."
"10120720","10125100"," And but sometimes they're runts or they're sick. "
"10126280","10129700"," You can't brand them or cut their balls in the young sometimes."
"10130340","10131120"," So you just got to let them be."
"10132520","10134680"," And what happens is they grow fast. "
"10134680","10142760"," And so before you know it, you're trying to, you're trying to brand and cut their balls when they"
"10142760","10144380"," weigh like 200 pounds."
"10147630","10149090"," And they get dangerous."
"10152350","10160800"," So you have to be, you have to be, oh dude, I got some crazy pictures. "
"10162180","10162620"," Hold on here."
"10166940","10167820"," My God."

"10399650","10401270"," Probably should be showing this stuff today. "
"10401890","10402450"," I guess it's scientific."
"10402750","10403770"," This is where you cut the balls right here."
"10404410","10406690"," You go in stiff and that's put a little plastic clip on them. "

"10419630","10424990"," Therefore, the auction should be digested with relative to the ease, according to JP Morgan's"
"10424990","10425150"," strategy."
"10425410","10426770"," So you flip a bull over, right?"
"10427010","10431130"," Grab his hind legs and you pull him tight."
"10431490","10433950"," The other guy wrestles down his other arm before they cut the ball. "
"10434250","10435370"," But that's you wrestle in a bull."

"11542420","11548400"," dismissing it outright from what the claims are on this they're claiming that the real reason"
"11548400","11554820"," Germany hasn't approved the transfer of leopards yet is really because they're waiting to see what"
"11554820","11559300"," Putin Putin's response to this offer is."

"13460550","13469710"," 402 65 or I wanted 403 65 yesterday but I don't think we're getting that I'm not on board with"

"13825810","13831310"," going to expect it doesn't guarantee it happens like that sometimes you'll see the roll earlier in"
"13831310","13835430"," the day then you'll see the squeeze higher than a two three four or three forty five then it'll"
"13835430","13843270"," come back down again something like that can happen to but surely up here you've got my back you'll"

"13937210","13945350"," actually hit earnings these are people that are believers Microsoft's not that kind of company you"
"13945350","13953690"," got 247 above here I'd like to see the gap close the 256 price target 252 on the on ER"
"13953690","13961530"," I think it'll be a good ER I think it has to be a really bad one for it not"
"13961530","13968590"," to continue to go up after there we are even if they sell off you know a lot of buy "
"13968590","13973890","-in down here and a lot of buy-in or a lot of selling over here this were some retailers"
"13973890","13980950"," we're selling they are retailers stuck above here so they're going to probably come in to play"
"13980950","13993540"," retailers are going to want to sell here feel"

"14000840","14005980"," off even if it sells off down here I'd be a buyer if they if they fill this box down"
"14005980","14013640"," here in our fact we'll just move this right here if we get a sell-off on their ER I"
"14013640","14018780"," would still buy it Microsoft's a great company I know you guys bitch and moan about Microsoft but"
"14018780","14025240"," you know don't be like bitches about tessel and then bitches about Microsoft you get what I'm"

"15718330","15722490"," an er reason for it maybe i guess maybe you're trying to call them out like facebook i don't think"

"16661340","16667580"," market right you can see it right here they didn't hold reject and sell down did they now so"

"16705259","16709759"," the than the one-minute trigger means we're going to be going up here right you put a stop"
"16709759","16715180"," underneath the blue line and we're looking for a new high you see this high pryer over here so i'm"
"16715180","16720419"," going to lead all this we know all that right we got the previous high at 401 15 so bulls"

"16725640","16732020"," least consolidate and tag 402 or 402 63 they don't have a lot of time left they've got but"
"16732020","16738099"," basically they have an hour to get this done 20 minutes to be honest with you to get this done"
"16738099","16743860"," so they don't have a ton of time until 3 p.m. you also have microsoft earnings coming into play"
