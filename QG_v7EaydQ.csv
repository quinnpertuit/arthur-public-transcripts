"369100","370300"," Will you want to be a mod again?"
"370300","370880"," Career low."
"371180","371400"," Hold on."
"371440","372680"," Let me see if I can make you a mod, man. "
"373240","374600"," I'm not good at this yet."
"375380","377280"," Oh, you did the prime gaming too?"
"378180","379200"," Let me see if I can."

"381700","384060"," I got yelled at the last time I tried doing this."
"385800","386540"," Hold on."
"388360","389660"," Mod career low. "
"390280","391420"," Okay, he's a mod now."
"392160","392800"," He's back."
"393100","394520"," He's on Twitch mod now. "
"395380","397060"," When they make a comment or something so I can see."
"398920","399400"," Okay."
"401520","402660"," Good morning out there. "
"403180","404020"," It's fed day."
"406080","409020"," So in the overnight, we saw in the overnight camp."
"409180","412020"," I don't know if you can see it here, but we didn't wake up to 4050. "
"412940","415280"," We saw the heads come in though on futures."
"415720","417040"," Secretations remain anchored."
"418960","420240"," We're going to look at the. "
"420600","422480"," We'll start the day with this."
"422480","422900"," Yes, we're going to."
"422960","424000"," We're going to names in the markets. "
"424000","425420"," Now is credits for each shares."
"425640","426140"," Extend losses."
"426480","427420"," Last down around five spots. "
"427740","429240"," Two percent on the tick SCS."
"429540","431340"," We'll let people pile in here."
"431800","433680"," And as they pile in. "
"434200","436000"," We'll just set the day up for everybody."
"436840","437580"," So they get."
"437860","439000"," Now, first off in the morning. "
"439600","440800"," For a fed rate decision."
"440980","444440"," As the probability of a nuclear conflict is high enough."
"444700","446040"," And it has been in the past decade. "
"446320","449420"," So again, it's been cited by Interfax coming from Rutgers."
"451640","453780"," Just not a fed day right away."
"454040","455620"," The morning is going to be. "
"455960","458160"," Think about the fed day as like you go to a."
"458980","461520"," Oh, I don't know, like a Harlem Globetrotter."
"461600","467420"," You know, you go to an all star basketball game and the early show is the Harlem Globetrotters."
"468920","472280"," Just a bunch of day traders showing off. "
"473020","474480"," For the crowd in here."
"474480","478260"," So you'll see classic setups typically a bunch of old school."
"479320","480280"," Trade setups. "
"481000","485840"," You'll see like a triangle and you'll see an expanding wedge and you'll see a dragon's tail."
"486520","489020"," And you'll see like a devil's wort."
"489340","490880"," And you'll see all these setups. "
"492060","494260"," Some of them will fail and then eventually get trapped."
"497000","499360"," Waiting for the decision and then some kind of a squeeze."
"499900","501040"," Now, we know the market has had. "
"501600","503560"," Heading into this event event as well."
"503560","506400"," So there's going to be a hedge on the market from the south side."
"507140","511700"," They're going to have their hand on the market until the last minute, right?"
"511860","516940"," They pull their hand away looking for any kind of weakness in the market as the day starts out. "
"517220","519260"," So if you want to trade this, you can."
"520559","526400"," Usually the most success that I have trading these days in early day and early morning are just"
"526400","527260"," classic setups."
"527560","532520"," If you see a bear flag, if you see a bull flag, you probably will see some day traders come"
"532520","534000"," in and trade like a one minute chart. "
"534000","535080"," I shit you not."
"536320","538920"," So just be aware of that as the day starts out here."
"539020","540740"," Otherwise, just hang out in the sidelines. "
"541300","545820"," We're going to set some stuff up for you so you can see where the implied move is."
"546420","548440"," You can see the expected move."
"548580","551960"," We'll talk about what's likely from the Fed today. "
"554380","555700"," All that kind of jazz."
"556340","558500"," We'll have some targets above some targets below."
"558500","560660"," Look at the Vex. "
"560780","563460"," We'll get a bunch of meme stonks and a bunch of other stuff here for you."
"565140","567980"," I guess the meme stonks now include regional banks."
"570140","577000"," So right off the bat this morning, let's look at the implied moves for today. "
"582220","584740"," Let's see what's being priced in for today."
"591160","592760"," First off, let's look at the options."
"593120","595180"," Let me check the options contract right now. "
"605770","607150"," But I'm not too bad today."
"607530","608850"," I'm quite impressed actually."
"609770","611050"," The pricing is reasonable. "
"612070","618410"," There's a large concentration of calls on 402C for $1.15. Not too bad."
"618690","619970"," Some of these decision days."
"621730","626710"," We can see $3, $4, $5 in the money zero dates. "
"626710","628770"," Kind of reasonable today."
"632170","633150"," Not too bad."
"633490","634650"," I'm actually quite impressed. "
"635010","637030"," It might make for a nice day for a strangle."
"637830","640950"," Oftentimes in these days, there's like grind that happens."
"641170","642490"," There's some theta burn on zero dates. "
"642850","646490"," But then you can get a good price on the up and down side moves."
"647530","648530"," They might print."
"648630","650370"," They might print full side believe it or not. "
"655770","661430"," And we've got a strangle or we've got a straddle in the market on March 23rd."
"662690","669050"," On $3.99 C and $3.98 P for the 23rd."
"669310","673430"," The 24th, we start to see things spread out a little bit. "
"674130","676970"," This is into I believe Friday, right?"
"677230","677530"," Yeah, Friday."
"678470","683210"," We can see a little bit of more spread in the options contracts and the highs and lows."
"686310","688730"," We're going to look further out to the 27th. "
"689070","689650"," Same deal."
"690750","693550"," I'm losing the monitor already this morning."
"696360","699860"," Let me look at the 31st real quick and see where the market is. "
"701360","703560"," Kind of a light book on the 31st."
"706780","708320"," Not not not too much."
"709020","710340"," No real decision to be made. "
"710480","710860"," It looks like."
"711040","711600"," Hold on a second here."
"721940","722600"," All right. "
"722800","723060"," We're back."
"723060","730870"," But not not too much."
"731250","732950"," Not that I can see and spy at least. "
"733130","734310"," I'll check SPX next."
"734930","737130"," But in spy at least not seeing too much."
"741310","748150"," Those four or two C's for today are now up to 22.5,000 contracts of $1.22. They were"
"748150","750170"," about 15 a few minutes ago. "
"754580","756400"," Let's look at the spread right now."
"760590","762310"," What am I looking for here?"
"763270","763790"," Spy."
"772050","775070"," Okay, so for the implied move for today. "
"778240","800080"," We've got 403.22 and 393.99. Not"
"800080","800640"," too crazy."
"803900","805640"," Actually not too crazy today."
"805640","806660"," I'm actually impressed. "
"806800","808380"," Sometimes it gets much wider."
"809260","810720"," We'll write implied move."
"812520","816040"," The options market is pricing in right now for the spy at least. "
"824030","826410"," We have some range expansion as."
"827950","829350"," As after today."
"829450","831910"," I would say after today we get some range expansion. "
"833650","834190"," 394."
"834570","835370"," I got this right here."
"835530","835910"," It's very good. "
"836010","836570"," It's exactly right."
"836650","837170"," 39401."
"843350","844670"," Right down here. "
"848220","851160"," This is our implied range."
"851460","852920"," The options market is pricing in."
"860580","861880"," Not too big, right?"
"865230","867250"," Not too much price than today. "
"867490","868770"," That's not really a large move."
"872190","872590"," 29864."
"873170","874530"," That's 40 points in that direction. "
"876150","877090"," 40 points in change."
"877430","880030"," We got another 3050 points to the upside."
"881450","883590"," A little bit of bias to the upside today. "
"885470","887050"," Now on these on these days."
"888250","890210"," I got some other stuff to plug in here for you this morning."
"890330","891010"," But on these days. "
"892030","893330"," There's two ways of looking at this."
"894250","895270"," But not two."
"895410","895990"," There's a bunch of ways. "
"895990","896630"," You can actually."
"896930","899950"," Not you can, but you can strangle this market."
"904010","904450"," 403s. "
"904810","907010"," So like 403s are 94 cents."
"908470","909930"," To the upside here, right?"
"910530","911730"," You can start to plan your day."
"911810","914990"," Maybe take an upside call and then you grab some downside puts. "
"915630","916350"," So you're 90."
"916630","917830"," Right now that 4040."
"918050","919570"," There are 95 cents. "
"921010","922710"," Now I've got 25,000."
"922790","923290"," They move from."
"923730","926410"," From four to three ninety nine C's. "
"926470","931430"," Those are now 25,000 contracts at $2.50. 403s are 93 cents."
"932010","932670"," 94 cents."
"932770","933410"," 92 cents. "
"933590","933970"," Something like that."
"934650","935950"," If you start making our way higher."
"936570","937170"," If you grab some calls. "
"937450","938010"," Start making our way down."
"938150","938690"," Grab some puts."
"939490","940670"," And you can strangle both sides. "
"940890","942270"," If we get any kind of a whiplash effect."
"943570","944590"," Somewhere in here today."
"945010","946650"," You can monetize each side. "
"946970","949070"," It's not an easy trade to manage."
"949410","949850"," I'll tell you that."
"950370","952450"," That's very stressful to manage a trade like this. "
"952450","953330"," Where you take both sides."
"954250","956310"," You can get your brain will tell you."
"956330","957890"," Oh, no, it's just going to keep crashing below. "
"958410","959730"," Meanwhile, it swings higher."
"960550","961530"," Another another rule."
"961730","967290"," Not rule, but rule that I live by on these days is a failure to actually tag in the money. "
"967750","968890"," So I said 49."
"969410","969830"," 403s."
"970870","972210"," 402s are sometimes better. "
"972430","973850"," Let's say on the downside."
"974270","974790"," Three ninety four."
"975730","978330"," Three ninety five might be better than the put side, right?"
"978490","980330"," You get a failure to actually tag the implied move. "
"980330","981750"," It's like a brief failure."
"982090","986110"," You're actually in a printing something closer to being in the money on the up and down side."
"986270","989030"," So I know they said 403, but you like four or twos. "
"989370","990450"," Three ninety five P."
"992690","995370"," For the 40 kind of bounce swings, you might might encounter."
"995790","999890"," Usually we get at least one or two up swings and down swings on these days."
"1000230","1001770"," It won't just be a one sided trade. "
"1002770","1003450"," I might might."
"1003990","1009470"," I think the only times where it doesn't happen is if there's a surprise."
"1010330","1012650"," Now a surprise can go two ways. "
"1014710","1019850"," I'm sure you hear people out there saying if we have a pause that there'll be a shock to the"
"1019850","1020090"," market."
"1020830","1021630"," I agree with that."
"1021690","1023349"," I think I agree with that to an extent. "
"1023530","1028470"," I think that if there's a rate cut or pause, there could be a violent move higher, believe it or"
"1028470","1028670"," not."
"1028890","1031510"," At least historically you'll see a violent move higher."
"1031810","1033290"," And then we begin a massive sell off. "
"1034349","1037190"," And you look at this from a perspective of a sell side hedge fund."
"1038510","1042609"," They're going to stand out of the way on a surprise, right?"
"1042810","1046710"," We'll get out of the way and allow the initial market reaction to be positive."
"1048690","1049830"," This isn't guaranteed. "
"1050470","1052970"," We'll take anything that I say is like this is financial advice."
"1053530","1056870"," You should always be consulting a financial advisor."
"1057090","1062670"," Who would probably tell you turn off my program and come down to the office and speak to them. "
"1063380","1064910"," But my experience at least."
"1065810","1069210"," If you have a rate, give a rate shock today that's positive."
"1070350","1072730"," Sell side hedge funds step out of the way. "
"1073330","1075110"," Markets going to explode higher."
"1076550","1077390"," And I mean explode."
"1077770","1083510"," The S&P 500 is the most shorted market shorted instrument out there right now. "
"1083570","1085350"," Spy and market hour specifically."
"1086610","1089850"," So you could probably see an explosive move higher."
"1089850","1094090"," But after the initial, wow, this is awesome sauce. "
"1094630","1095430"," Everything is great."
"1096050","1096470"," Woohoo."
"1097590","1100710"," Could roll right back over and become a violent move down. "
"1101470","1106030"," Because you will see it push that more is broken than you have seen."
"1107050","1108390"," So keep that in mind."
"1109270","1112190"," Another rate shock would be 50 BPS. "
"1113790","1114870"," 50 BPS."
"1115290","1117110"," I have seen events like that."
"1117110","1118410"," You will see an event like that. "
"1118750","1125810"," And one of the key things you will be looking for if something like that occurs is instead of just"
"1125810","1126650"," a move lower."
"1129420","1130140"," There we go."
"1130260","1130460"," Homie. "
"1130800","1131740"," Let me close this up for a minute."
"1133480","1136040"," You can usually figure these things out quite quickly."
"1136980","1139480"," If there is a rate shock, let's say there is anything that is bad. "
"1140100","1141100"," I mean like bad."
"1142360","1143160"," Like 50 BPS."
"1143940","1144660"," Fuck your calls. "
"1145780","1146540"," Fuck you."
"1146680","1147860"," Fuck the pours."
"1148560","1149640"," And we are keeping everything. "
"1150520","1151380"," Something like that."
"1151600","1158220"," You will normally not just see a drop to just below the implied move."
"1158500","1160000"," You will actually see a smash through it. "
"1161260","1163920"," Sometimes you will see below the implied move."
"1164160","1166540"," A fake out and then a smash through it."
"1166680","1168140"," That is in the UK bricks that deal. "
"1168460","1170320"," And this is really key here."
"1170960","1172800"," Does it or does it not recover?"
"1172800","1176720"," If it does not recover turns around something like this."
"1177180","1179140"," That is usually really, really bad. "
"1180380","1181560"," And it does not recover."
"1181800","1184180"," You will typically see violent moves."
"1184400","1185420"," Violent moves all the way down. "
"1186060","1188060"," And you will think it is coming back and it is not."
"1188220","1188580"," It is going to close."
"1188800","1190580"," It is going to continue selling for the next three days. "
"1191280","1195480"," So just be aware of these movements in the market as they take place."
"1197680","1200500"," Now these are positive and negative shocks to the market."
"1201400","1203220"," These are the outliers, right?"
"1203920","1205420"," These outliers take place. "
"1206480","1212800"," Sometimes on a Fed rate decision day it is better to have a reaction trade, right?"
"1213040","1215180"," You do not get involved in any of this bullshit in the morning."
"1215900","1218220"," Then you wait for the first move to come out, right?"
"1218680","1223620"," If you see the market start to squeeze up and it starts to feel here."
"1223780","1226520"," You can short this down then buy this back up again, right?"
"1227060","1227900"," Something like that. "
"1227900","1233960"," If the market starts to sell off into the Fed rate decision, you can usually buy a dip."
"1234180","1234600"," Come up here."
"1235060","1239160"," It is easier sometimes to sit on your hands and not do anything. "
"1240440","1242840"," I know that some of you out there are going to say, no cap."
"1244080","1247120"," Historically, recently, at least in recent history, what happens?"
"1247360","1251900"," We trade sideways and we eventually squeeze up like 11, 31, 30 in the afternoon."
"1254120","1255400"," The presser is released. "
"1255400","1256400"," We squeeze higher."
"1256540","1263080"," We come back down for the presser and then we squeeze higher again, right?"
"1263240","1264480"," Something like this usually does."
"1264820","1270640"," In recent memory at least has been how the market reacts on these rate decision days. "
"1270980","1272620"," Then we usually cool off into the close."
"1273440","1276580"," Then the real move is after tomorrow, Friday."
"1276900","1278720"," Sometimes it is Friday or even Monday. "
"1278920","1279800"," You will not get a real move."
"1279980","1281200"," They will just kill the options market."
"1281920","1282560"," Thank you for playing. "
"1282560","1287060"," We are going sideways on Friday and then Monday you get the actual move in the market."
"1289780","1296180"," That is if we get 25 BPS, the Fed's job today is not an easy one."
"1296680","1300340"," The Fed's job today is threading a needle is going to be a challenge. "
"1301240","1302460"," We have seen him in the past."
"1303100","1305440"," I want to highlight this about the Fed."
"1306420","1309920"," We have seen this in the past where the Fed needs to thread a needle. "
"1312240","1315760"," Jerome will stick to a script that is prepared."
"1316920","1320260"," It will normally be like 25 BPS."
"1320800","1321700"," We are going to fight inflation. "
"1321960","1322660"," Blah, blah, blah."
"1323180","1328200"," If the wrong person asks him a question, he will go off on the handlebars."
"1329120","1332380"," He will go off on the handlebars and slam this market. "
"1333980","1337580"," He will that does happen inside of the presser."
"1337580","1340180"," Be very careful inside of that presser."
"1341440","1343700"," What he says inside of that presser. "
"1343720","1344820"," He could get aggressive and angry."
"1345540","1348280"," He does not come off as an emotionally angry person."
"1348800","1350820"," You can actually see that in what he is saying. "
"1351920","1353060"," He has to thread a needle today."
"1353540","1354440"," There is no doubt about it."
"1355140","1358320"," There is no doubt about it that it is going to be easy for him. "
"1358740","1361280"," The agreement that he is made with the market."
"1361560","1365160"," The agreement that he has made with Bob on Main Street."
"1365160","1368380"," The agreement that he has made with the bond market, the banks, VCs. "
"1368960","1377240"," Everyone out there has been broken at this point and he needs to renegotiate this agreement."
"1377640","1383500"," Whether it is the same agreement, a new agreement is still unknown at this point."
"1385300","1390560"," The other thing too is that the trust in the Fed has definitely been damaged at this point. "
"1392520","1393440"," Definitely been damaged."
"1393440","1395880"," There is no way around this that is the case."
"1396940","1398380"," We also have political pressures. "
"1398680","1402760"," I see that talked about in the news that there are political pressures inside."
"1403160","1407140"," We have a bull trade setting up here."
"1408120","1411140"," Right now I would want to see some kind of confirmation here. "
"1412280","1413000"," Just off of this open."
"1414240","1419080"," You want to see just the trade up and then some kind of a."
"1421000","1424100"," Some kind of some proof back over here before you do anything."
"1424800","1429460"," But I do want you to realize that the presser itself is kind of key today. "
"1430920","1437200"," And as likely key where you might get some volatility that is unexpected and not scripted."
"1438620","1443460"," That would be the key one for you to pay attention to."
"1444180","1447640"," Is the press is going to be so important. "
"1447700","1449640"," I don't know how the other way to describe that."
"1449980","1452140"," The presser can sometimes come off as positive."
"1452140","1454000"," Hey, here's my prepared remarks. "
"1454400","1456460"," Here's my prepared answers for all these."
"1459500","1463380"," Reporters and then one reporter comes out and asks the hard question."
"1463660","1467220"," In five minutes time now, 10 to 15 a.m. Eastern time or around this time. "
"1467560","1468760"," The UK breaks the deal."
"1470800","1471980"," And that's all it takes."
"1472120","1475580"," It takes takes one question after all the bullshit comes out. "
"1476060","1478020"," You know that you just asked the fed the one question."
"1478920","1483120"," You know you kind of you kind of fucking these people over you're fucking these people over or."
"1483620","1484980"," How do you fight inflation?"
"1486180","1490560"," Then yet not raise rates and you look at the look at the balance sheet. "
"1490840","1493880"," Anything that's like not scripted and he could go to town."
"1495220","1499240"," This is just be just be aware of that as the day as the day unfolds today."
"1500820","1505640"," If you are a new trader, I'm going to tell you on these days, right?"
"1505840","1509200"," One of the best parts about these days is not to trade. "
"1509500","1510360"," I have to tell you that."
"1511760","1515200"," You can come into this market normally any day of the week."
"1516420","1518760"," The best days we all know are trend days. "
"1519160","1521300"," The even the sideways days though."
"1521960","1526840"," You can usually get in and out of the market, make 100% make 200%."
"1526840","1528660"," These are easy trades. "
"1529320","1531700"," Every day you can show up on these event days."
"1533320","1533820"," It's a gamble."
"1534800","1538440"," If you're if you're here today with me and you're like, I'm going to trade this today. "
"1538780","1542300"," I'm hoping that you're like it's 1% 5%."
"1543400","1547900"," 3% 0.05% of your account."
"1549240","1554220"," That you're trading that you're not out here going, yeah, I'm in 100% trade here and then then I"
"1554220","1556840"," just doubled it and now I'm double down my money. "
"1556940","1559200"," Now I'm triple down my money and now I'm losing money."
"1559400","1562080"," At the end of the day, I'm going to go back to work at Wendy's or something."
"1562300","1563060"," Any of that kind of stuff. "
"1564120","1567620"," If you're even that kind of a trader, today is not the day for you more than likely."
"1567960","1571460"," Or pick a trade and stick to it and it could be willing to lose all of your money."
"1572460","1574640"," These days are not normal trading days. "
"1577480","1581360"," There's all kinds of traps here for you to lose your money."
"1581580","1586560"," If you are that person and you're taking a trade right now at this moment, you're likely going to"
"1586560","1590240"," lose by the time you, even if you're winning now, you're likely going to lose part of that trade"
"1590240","1591580"," before you even get the decision."
"1593420","1595140"," Honestly, these are the days to watch. "
"1595340","1598580"," These are the days to become familiar, especially if you're not familiar."
"1599240","1601480"," You don't watch every rate decision, every Fed meeting."
"1601980","1605880"," This is one of those days where you pay for trade it, where you just sit and watch in the"
"1605880","1610960"," background and see the motions of the market and how it moves on days like today. "
"1618180","1625440"," I'm telling you, these are not only these dangerous, they fuck with your mind because you'll want"
"1625440","1626140"," to sell."
"1627780","1631600"," You'll see it bleed down and sell and then rip higher and you would have said, man, if I had"
"1631600","1636040"," just stayed in that trade, I'd be rich right now, or at least when I made my money back."
"1637180","1638940"," I got to say it one more time. "
"1639180","1645340"," If you're not done in the spot, in, out, in, out, you can see the dips to buy and the"
"1645340","1652100"," rips to sell regularly, like 70 to 90% of the time, if you don't make 7 out of 10"
"1652100","1654040"," good trades, this isn't for you."
"1654960","1656420"," You don't want none of this, Dewey."
"1657600","1661340"," If you're not willing to lose all your money in a day like today, this isn't for you. "
"1662280","1666700"," You're showing up with your $1,000 paycheck and you're like, I'm going to let it all ride on black."
"1667660","1668660"," This is probably not the day."
"1668760","1675800"," There's so many easier days to make money, easier setups to make money, setups that follow through"
"1675800","1677200"," to make money. "
"1677660","1678740"," There is another question here."
"1678900","1681800"," There's something else to talk about here and that is a volcrush."
"1682380","1686140"," If we don't get a bad rate, if we don't get anything out of the norm, if we get something"
"1686140","1689280"," normal, there'll be a volcrush trade in here too. "
"1689640","1693780"," There's a way to be looking for some kind of volatility crush trade in the future."
"1694240","1696260"," I know a lot of you out there are saying, now the VIX is down."
"1697080","1698300"," There's no volcrush here. "
"1700020","1700980"," The trade's over."
"1701380","1702940"," I'm assuming that there could be."
"1703500","1709580"," If you see the volatility spike today, but then after post-event, and this is the last part. "
"1709700","1711800"," This is the little asterisk trade."
"1713340","1716820"," The market will be repriced today once, if not twice."
"1717380","1722520"," So any options that you're looking at the rest of the week, possibly even some bleed over into next"
"1722520","1727360"," week, you're going to see reprising of options two to three times today. "
"1727380","1733200"," You'll see the initial move, you'll see the initial move, and then immediately, no matter which"
"1733200","1737560"," direction it goes, up or down, you're going to see the reprising of options."
"1738560","1741780"," If you get to the other move, the next move should see a reprising of options."
"1741780","1746980"," You'll also sometimes see reprising of options as we close the day out into tomorrow. "
"1747260","1749140"," So don't get trapped in that either."
"1749400","1750920"," Don't be like, whoo, this is awesome."
"1751760","1754060"," My $10 options are now going to $40. "
"1754500","1755180"," That's not happening."
"1755800","1760800"," They're going to reprice your ass down from $10 to $1, and then you might make three bucks."
"1761140","1762200"," Do not get caught in the trap. "
"1762360","1763920"," Everything today is directional based."
"1765420","1769540"," And it doesn't matter if you're buying options for Friday for today."
"1769540","1772800"," They're going to reprice all this shit, guaranteed today. "
"1779160","1782680"," Winky faces in the house today has had meetings all week long."
"1782880","1783840"," Good to see Winky here today."
"1786400","1787200"," All right. "
"1788380","1789720"," So that's all out of the way."
"1789920","1790580"," Blah, blah, blah."
"1791020","1791740"," Implied moves. "
"1792700","1795520"," We're now going to add in the next thing."
"1799510","1801770"," We're now in the next layer for you this morning."
"1805650","1807370"," This is the one that the bears want. "
"1815510","1816370"," We're right here."
"1816470","1816930"," Give me a second."
"1817730","1818710"," Hold on here. "
"1823010","1823530"," Okay."
"1823930","1827130"," I want you at home."
"1827350","1828610"," Get yourself piece paper to pen. "
"1828790","1829750"," Get yourself a notepad."
"1830550","1833390"," Get yourself a crayon that doesn't roll off the table."
"1834370","1836290"," Go to the back page of your coloring book. "
"1839440","1841100"," Back page of your coloring book."
"1843900","1846140"," As long as price stays above."
"1846940","1848240"," Currently in the spy. "
"1850940","1852900"," Three ninety eight fifty one."
"1853520","1855020"," Well, the trade is long."
"1855240","1855480"," Okay. "
"1855720","1856340"," Trade is long."
"1860120","1863080"," The only support for both the bulls today."
"1863220","1867480"," The only support for today specifically the hourly right here. "
"1867980","1870140"," Three ninety six twenty eight."
"1871500","1872160"," Okay."
"1874160","1877120"," There's a band of support though for the bulls. "
"1877460","1878800"," Three ninety five sixty two."
"1880560","1882060"," Three ninety six thirty."
"1883500","1884680"," Twenty eight I guess. "
"1885680","1886940"," Three ninety six forty two."
"1888240","1890700"," And three ninety six ninety eight."
"1892240","1895340"," The two main support levels here for bulls. "
"1896220","1897460"," Is this one right here."
"1899880","1901340"," This green one right here."
"1902260","1904620"," This is where bulls tee off intraday. "
"1905720","1907980"," And bears on the on the downside of as well."
"1909080","1913460"," And then the daily the daily is kind of the key for bulls to hold."
"1914360","1916880"," This daily right here sets trend. "
"1917480","1919400"," And believe it or not if you're a bear out there."
"1920420","1922460"," We just for the first time."

"2125810","2127390"," This isn't good enough for you."
"2127890","2128830"," Not good enough."
"2129050","2130210"," Just an opportunity to buy a dip. "
"2130530","2133050"," You're a bear you need to get underneath both of these."
"2133810","2138510"," And then you need to get underneath this implied move to go lower here."
"2138510","2141270"," So this is some key levels here for for bears to see. "
"2141550","2145290"," You want to see if you're a bear out there you want to see the break of the daily the"

"2267690","2269790"," See if it shows up on this chart here."
"2270650","2272130"," Don't see it showing up here."

"2321330","2323270"," Places where they've teed off in the past."
"2325050","2327370"," It's going back in February 2nd."
"2327970","2330210"," It's also up this right where our three is right now. "
"2331210","2333570"," And if bulls want to see continuation to the upside."
"2334570","2336790"," You definitely do not want to see."
"2340170","2344410"," Bulls definitely want to get above our three and then hold above here. "
"2344790","2346470"," You would still take profit up here."
"2347490","2350750"," Then you would wait for confirmation or even a trade higher."
"2350750","2355470"," A confirmation trade and that's your second bull's trade higher for bulls. "
"2356170","2358510"," So even today let's look at today real quick."
"2358830","2360570"," So even if we have this move higher today right."

"2365450","2366430"," Yeah we broke Bob."
"2366890","2369270"," You're still going to take your profit in here."
"2369610","2371130"," Either here or here. "
"2371130","2377110"," One spot five five million range of one spot five to minus three spot five million expected."
"2377730","2382790"," Gasoline inventories forecast minus two spot three six four million on the prior minus two spot"
"2382790","2383770"," zero six one million."
"2384250","2389370"," Distillative inventories forecast minus one spot five million prior minus two spot five three seven"
"2389370","2389630"," million. "
"2390150","2394610"," And the crude pushing inventories to a prior of minus one spot nine one six million."
"2395170","2398070"," Again just looking to the API numbers that did come out last night."
"2398370","2403110"," So API crude oil stock change came out at three spot two six two million. "
"2403330","2406450"," So that was a build on the forecast of minus one spot four four eight million."
"2408630","2411370"," So even if you get this trade today let's see you get it tomorrow."
"2411650","2414650"," Let's say you get the R2 today and you get the R3 tomorrow right. "
"2414750","2415530"," Let's say it's tomorrow."
"2415690","2416370"," Let's say it's Friday."
"2417870","2419270"," No matter what happens here. "
"2419750","2421330"," You're not in this trade up here."
"2421530","2422770"," You're taking your money and running."
"2423010","2423570"," You're not asking. "
"2423670","2424350"," You're not saying hey cap."
"2424870","2426810"," When we're up here you're not like hey cap now I'm bullish."
"2427030","2427730"," I'm going to jump in. "
"2428110","2430130"," This isn't where you jump in above here."
"2430950","2431050"," Okay."
"2431650","2435170"," You have to then wait for the confirmation that would be we go higher. "
"2436050","2437970"," Then we actually retest."
"2439610","2440510"," Right here."
"2441190","2445610"," And then only then do you get the confirmation to take this market long as like hey it's a new"
"2445610","2446170"," bull market. "
"2446690","2450070"," You do not get involved in the trade maybe day trade and you couldn't hear."
"2450470","2454070"," We did not get involved in this trade like I'm full port and long calls."
"2454810","2460190"," Because this is also a great place for the rollover to come in and you get trapped right. "
"2460630","2465230"," You know like everybody buying calls nobody buying puts everybody long the market and they roll"
"2465230","2467870"," your ass and the real dip by was down here to go higher."
"2468630","2470630"," So just be really careful this up above."
"2471450","2472890"," Oftentimes you'll see this fail. "
"2474070","2477270"," And this is the actual the this is the actual bull run right here."
"2478110","2479630"," Okay somewhere down in here."
"2481470","2485170"," Another thing that happens up in here is you'll get this move higher. "
"2485930","2490330"," You get the first rip higher and you'll be like yeah fuck yeah new bull market will come back down."
"2490330","2493630"," And then you get the failure and the actual buy was down here."
"2493770","2496250"," Again this is all options market kind of bullshit. "
"2501210","2502830"," Coming up on that H line now."
"2503510","2508230"," If you're gonna if you are trying to run a strangle or straddle on this market."
"2508750","2512830"," You bought your call side you're trying to get up in here and grab the put side for the rest"
"2512830","2513970"," of the day above here. "
"2514550","2516870"," And then you can have some cheap calls and some cheap puts."
"2517630","2522770"," And you can hold them right through to right through the fed decision this afternoon."
"2538640","2540440"," Alright let's see what you guys are talking about. "

"2627310","2628050"," I agree with that statement."
"2628710","2633890"," I am fascinated Super Bowl man about the pivot."
"2634250","2637510"," When does it come for a more aggressive fed. "
"2638230","2641570"," Now they did make an agreement saying that they would always telegraph."
"2643330","2647290"," What that is prior to that those days are over of hiding stuff from us."
"2647290","2648930"," I am fascinated. "
"2649830","2660070"," I am fascinated to an extent with what supposedly was said earlier last week about whether"
"2660070","2663550"," the market is priced will determine the ultimate rate hike."
"2663850","2669650"," Now squeezing past the eight line trades three ninety nine eighty seven."
"2669770","2671990"," Now looking for four hundred thirty six. "

"2683610","2683770"," million. "
"2684050","2686690"," We'll swear to draw on the forecast of minus one spot five million."
"2687210","2692030"," The street eighty nine sees and out trade three dollars and twenty one says three million."

"2721250","2722570"," He's making a fair point. "
"2722670","2724630"," That's my question is when do we get."
"2727650","2732730"," When do we end up getting that one moment where we get a change in the Fed."
"2733130","2735310"," Will that be telegraph to us or not. "
"2735930","2740090"," And then also what Dave Howe said about where the price of the market is."
"2740090","2744910"," One points my rate hike decision to Russia for the Ukraine more."
"2745770","2750510"," And the only thing that I thought to myself when that was said was are you shitting me all of"
"2750510","2755970"," these scientists out there all these smart people out there and you're you're leaving it to the"
"2755970","2757550"," price of the stock market. "
"2758510","2761050"," Will determine where you're where you're."

"2844270","2846550"," Boomers only care about the 401k."
"2846670","2847150"," I don't think so."
"2847270","2848910"," I think boomers care about rental properties. "
"2851030","2854630"," That's what I think boomers care about rental properties man."
"2854750","2856030"," The more they can amass the better."
"2857170","2859770"," We're going to create an entire class of surfs. "
"2861810","2862910"," It's kind of gross."
"2865110","2868510"," Yeah I know the 401k burger equals happy voters."
"2870230","2871570"," I saw that too. "
"2873330","2874950"," It's boat and season baby."
"2879170","2881730"," Can't be hurt in that 401k in those houses."
"2895300","2900920"," Yeah we know we know that we know that ultimately a larger time frame that bears always lose on the"
"2900920","2901560"," S&P right. "
"2902240","2903380"," We already kind of know that."
"2918940","2920820"," Did someone say Spy to zero?"
"2929560","2931300"," How about trading VIX for the week?"
"2932900","2934300"," We'll look at the VIX right now."
"2939480","2941140"," We got VIXpiration right. "
"2951590","2953330"," Oh yeah maybe VIXpiration."
"2955790","2957290"," Let's look at VIXpiration."
"2957890","2959190"," We'll look at the half hour. "
"2960430","2963670"," And we'll look at the one minute chart on VIXpiration."
"2970430","2972770"," You can see that demand came in here."
"2973050","2973990"," Demand came in here. "
"2974310","2974370"," Here."
"2975190","2976250"," And we're looking down below."
"2976910","2980950"," That roughly around $19.56 on the VIX. "
"2981210","2983110"," For looking forward demand here."
"2984110","2985830"," We're going to build something we're looking for of course."
"2986250","2992670"," No demand down here at about $19.56. VIX is becoming bearish right now. "
"2992670","2995290"," You can see it's just starting to turn down."
"2995910","2997910"," There's a little bit of bullishness on the VIX right now."
"2998070","2999650"," At least on the hourly from the daily. "
"3000070","3002670"," Overall starting to turn down."
"3003310","3008030"," We do see some appetite for buying the VIX still on the hourly."
"3009090","3012010"," The one minute and the five minute there's still kind of bearish right now. "
"3012150","3015990"," But overall we should see some kind of a demand as we head into the later part of the day."
"3016470","3019630"," You're going to be looking for some key levels here if you are a VIX bull."
"3021210","3023750"," Your two places you're looking for are. "
"3025870","3028190"," Twenty one twenty twenty one eighty six."
"3030250","3032450"," And probably twenty two."
"3034190","3035150"," Twenty seven. "
"3035610","3036490"," Twenty two twenty seven."
"3036590","3037190"," You want to see a trade."
"3037690","3039750"," You want to not only see the demand kick in down here. "

"3071010","3073690"," You can see that consolidation and move higher. "
"3073870","3074730"," You could long the VIX."

"3134630","3137970"," And you have time for the one minute to come up here and meet up with it."
"3138010","3139410"," One minute still a little bit low on it. "

"3179300","3180480"," Right in here. "

"3195330","3196270"," Truthfully though."
"3196930","3200110"," The best trade here is waiting for the hourly to come up. "
"3200970","3202850"," So GME could be developing."
"3203150","3204750"," You want to see this hourly come up here."
"3206170","3207930"," And possibly price come back down. "
"3208890","3210410"," Then look for the trade somewhere in here."

"3597930","3600950"," Say the price is above with a pullback. "
"3601450","3606470"," One sixty three and fifty fifty fifty fifty three cents in the next target above after that one"

"4160770","4165270"," Trading on a one, two, three, four trigger cluster right now they're sitting. "
"4166010","4167410"," Tesla bulls are sitting on."
"4169229","4172310"," Probably the most bullish place they could be right now."
"4177060","4181760"," If you're looking for a dip to buy in Tesla as long as it doesn't break that one eighty six"
"4181760","4183520"," could be a bullish. "
"4184180","4189200"," Well it could be a trap, but it could be a very bullish outcome for the bulls on Tesla."
"4189359","4190760"," I'm sure they're all talking about it."
"4191399","4192700"," They're all getting hot and sweaty. "
"4193740","4196440"," You can see that bullish consolidation forming up."
"4197020","4199800"," They want to see face rippers higher."
"4200460","4202000"," If you are in a trade on Tesla. "
"4202760","4205000"," Just note that one eighty six."
"4205900","4207640"," It needs to hold."
"4208500","4210680"," Now that breaks below briefly that's not. "
"4211280","4213060"," That's not breaking below."
"4213360","4216160"," Let me spray up Tesla one more time for the Tesla bulls."
"4218240","4220220"," The best Tesla bulls can see this. "
"4220620","4223340"," So, talk Tesla real quick."
"4225220","4227820"," Tesla on the daily looking bearish."
"4228520","4228820"," See that?"
"4229160","4234900"," So this is an indication saying that we're not actually bear our bullish here. "
"4234980","4235800"," We're actually bearish."
"4236860","4242460"," The hourly starting to roll over here too starting to look bearish."
"4243960","4250760"," So, though, Tesla looks bullish here on the outside of everything. "
"4250760","4252440"," Let me get rid of some of this stuff here."
"4257110","4261030"," On the facade of Tesla, Tesla looks extremely bullish."
"4263150","4267570"," I will say to you that momentum is saying otherwise. "
"4268430","4270890"," The momentum is saying that Tesla is going to."
"4272870","4275970"," Price is going to break below one eighty five."
"4275970","4279260"," One eighty six and continue its move lower. "
"4279830","4281210"," I want you to be aware of this because."
"4282930","4284950"," If you're long right now, Tesla."
"4285990","4289770"," You need to see for the for your trade to be dead. "
"4290430","4294650"," You'll want to see price not only break below this one eighty six."
"4295470","4296470"," But reject."
"4297210","4299450"," So just be just be conscious of this. "
"4300090","4302970"," The rejection trade is where it's at for you."
"4302970","4304110"," So let's say you're long Tesla."
"4305530","4309850"," And Tesla breaks below briefly and you start panicking and you want to sell. "
"4310670","4314410"," Oftentimes you can wait for the rejection trade to then get out of your trade."
"4315310","4317550"," For the for the for the move lower later on."
"4317810","4324170"," Now, if it breaks below and it comes back up, no problem holds its pants up and continues higher. "
"4324370","4326430"," You can then reenter the trade in here."
"4326430","4330370"," So if you're long Tesla, there is no problem being long on the outside at least."
"4330610","4331730"," It looks fine on the surface. "
"4331730","4334870"," Tesla looks like it's consolidating for an extreme move higher."
"4335290","4336830"," If you're already long here, I get it."
"4337810","4343010"," Just know that if you break below, you can always wait for wait for a retest. "
"4343390","4347490"," Get out of your trade and then wait for a move higher consolidation."
"4347570","4350250"," Maybe even a recheck to go higher here."
"4351170","4352730"," Just be careful in here. "
"4353050","4359070"," There's some underlying stuff saying that Tesla is weaker than it looks on the surface."
"4359070","4360310"," It's just down here."
"4360510","4362870"," It's not completely weak, but not the best either. "
"4363090","4363850"," See it right here."
"4364490","4365990"," You really do want to see Tesla."
"4369610","4371930"," Velocity here starts to move higher. "
"4372570","4373350"," Let me show you that."
"4373870","4380050"," I want to start seeing some yellow bars here just for confirmation bias that we're going to trade"
"4380050","4380570"," higher here."
"4380630","4384690"," You want to see like this starts to develop on the downside, especially on FOMC Day. "
"4384690","4388550"," You start to see this stuff develop here and it'll break down in Tesla."
"4389290","4391350"," You have normal waves in Tesla, right?"
"4391450","4393690"," When you trade in Tesla, you actually see them."
"4393730","4394790"," It's not too hard to see. "
"4396970","4401150"," Trading below, trading above, trading below, trading above over here."
"4401930","4403250"," It's not quite bullish yet."
"4403490","4407790"," You want to kind of see, you kind of want to see some development here. "
"4407890","4409070"," You kind of want to see this develop."
"4409970","4413290"," So another way to look at this with Tesla would be on price."
"4415770","4419650"," You want to see the confirmation trade take that long right there. "
"4419770","4425170"," You want to see it test and then make its move and then you're set up with the trade long"
"4425170","4426530"," and you take it there."
"4441800","4445520"," Yeah, price starting above on Tesla, as you already know, is like $242."
"4447600","4456560"," You have a speed bump above on Tesla at $223.26. And then $240 and change above. "
"4458500","4462320"," And if you were to measure that move, you know, we're going somewhere higher, right?"
"4462440","4466720"," You know, we're going to like 300 bucks and then we're going to 350."
"4468120","4472460"," And then we're going to go kill some shorts above at 400 at some point, right?"
"4473500","4474460"," That's a lot of work ahead."
"4474460","4475040"," That's a lot of work ahead. "
"4475380","4476460"," For testables out there."
"4477460","4478640"," That's that no landing."
"4483530","4485810"," Kelly's old school setups going on in here. "
"4488860","4491240"," All these old school setups going on."
"4497340","4500140"," Got the old bull flag that fails on you in here."
"4502040","4507220"," At the old, oh, yeah, baby, you caught it down here and then boom, they slam it down on you. "
"4513140","4514100"," Too funny."
"4548020","4549300"," Oh, that's some coffee here."
"4549340","4549660"," Give me that. "
"4549720","4550560"," I'm going to take a quick break here."
"4561560","4563140"," Hey, you're welcome for the Tesla breakdown."
"4566750","4571590"," Evergrande estimates off your debt holders to recover nine spots, seven, three billion. "
"4571730","4573990"," What is prime video feed?"
"4574210","4578910"," If you're a Twitch, so I so this stream that you are seeing here."
"4580890","4582570"," It streams to YouTube."
"4583090","4584210"," It streams to Twitch. "
"4585190","4588870"," It's re streamed in some other places as well."
"4589510","4593150"," Some feeds in Europe and then some blogs and discord."
"4594610","4598890"," So there are different groups of people watching in different places. "
"4600070","4602870"," And one of the places I was discussing on Twitch early."
"4603110","4605830"," So on Twitch, you're a Twitch subscriber, a follower."
"4606390","4608070"," You can go to Amazon prime. "
"4608950","4610970"," Sign up for, I believe, Amazon gaming."
"4611670","4616530"," And then you can subscribe for free to my channel."
"4618330","4626450"," On Twitch and it takes $2.50 a month from Jeff Bezos and pays me. "
"4626830","4628570"," It's free, free way for you to support the channel."
"4629350","4630430"," A very easy way to do it."
"4630710","4632030"," Now, YouTube doesn't have anything like that. "
"4635010","4636430"," So those are for people that aren't Twitch."
"4637450","4640890"," I think that a wiki can describe it better than I can."
"4660980","4661800"," Oh, no way. "
"4662000","4663860"," So I was offered partnership this week, Wiki."
"4664080","4664980"," Should I take it or no?"
"4672300","4674820"," ECB's Viscos as credit growth has stopped in Europe."
"4674820","4677260"," The most important thing is to avoid a credit crunch. "
"4682460","4685480"," ECB's Panethas as banks will pass on my more than in the past."
"4685580","4686280"," Did I take partnership?"
"4686640","4687240"," Do you think or no?"
"4693820","4696380"," Yeah, I would have to stop streaming on YouTube, wouldn't I?"
"4697120","4697880"," I forgot about that."
"4699820","4701160"," Yeah, I remember that. "
"4701160","4702080"," I forgot about that."
"4702140","4703100"," I have to bail on YouTube."
"4705380","4709000"," I heard of some, you know what, some people are doing is they were doing two streams. "
"4709000","4715260"," They say that I could get someone, people were saying it could do like a second camera setup with a"
"4715260","4720240"," second instance of streamlabs and just separate both of them and they're both now like, like a"
"4720240","4722240"," camera's on one side and a camera's on this side."
"4723120","4724140"," And then it is two streams."
"4724460","4725400"," Technically, you get away with it. "
"4725400","4733900"," And some other people were saying that the language is vague on exclusivity."
"4734620","4737120"," And then other people were like, well, you tried fucking around there."
"4737220","4738620"," You'll find out, I guess, won't you?"
"4744470","4748070"," We could also monetize YouTube and people could sub to you there. "
"4752710","4754270"," You haven't thought of that either."
"4755330","4757270"," I haven't done any kind of monetization."
"4757270","4763410"," Well, you know what's funny too is that I did, um, I did the, I went through the Amazon affiliate"
"4763410","4766090"," program for books, like the books that you see there. "
"4766470","4771130"," And I got kicked out yesterday because I didn't post the links inside of the website."
"4772270","4776410"," So I have to like post them on the website, but the funny part is the amount of time that"
"4776410","4780130"," it took to be approved as an Amazon affiliate."
"4780590","4782530"," And I have to go back through the entire process again. "
"4782530","4786410"," And then I looked at what I made on Amazon Prime for the books."
"4786710","4790690"," It was like a dollar 50 or some in total."
"4792190","4794450"," So I was like, this is even worth the time. "
"4795110","4795910"," Probably not."
"4803370","4804630"," Probably not worth it."
"4816340","4817380"," Yeah, the answer is clear. "
"4817540","4817940"," Don't take it."
"4818040","4818120"," Yeah."
"4819840","4821860"," Yeah, I agree with the partnership stuff. "
"4822240","4824980"," Well, that's what some people are saying."
"4825160","4826440"," I watched a couple of videos on YouTube."
"4827600","4830180"," And some people are like, I don't take the Twitch partnership. "
"4838230","4840850"," Yeah, Joe, I was going to send, uh, I was going to have."
"4843590","4846630"," I was going to have Mrs. James send you those links."
"4847350","4848750"," I haven't talked to everybody yet. "
"4848770","4851090"," She's going to be upset because she's the one that actually did that work."
"4851790","4854250"," I have to go tell her, Hey, you got to read, redo all this stuff."
"4854390","4858150"," And then I want you to send these links to, uh, to Joe post. "
"4863610","4867190"," Yeah, I agree with Winky here though, Twitch is ultimately better for streaming."
"4868870","4869990"," I'm going to agree with you, Winky."
"4870510","4875870"," I have to say that, uh, if you guys, if you're on YouTube, you got to give Twitch a chance. "
"4877510","4879430"," There's some real positives on Twitch."
"4879830","4884450"," They, uh, well, there's some, some things I don't care for right now."
"4884490","4888930"," They don't save your videos so that it would add an extra layer of work we'd have to. "
"4890090","4897450"," I'd have to record each live stream and then post them to our website to store, right?"
"4897570","4899910"," Because right now they only save six days worth of videos."
"4901930","4905570"," And then, uh, so we have, I think we'd have to figure something out to store our own videos."
"4906710","4912270"," Uh, on the website, I guess, and I think maybe that changes as, as time, or if you get enough"
"4912270","4913370"," subs or something. "
"4913370","4917390"," Uh, maybe they let you keep them on there longer, but the storage is an issue."
"4917510","4918890"," YouTube's like, Hey, we'll keep it everyone."
"4919850","4921270"," Um, which is kind of nice. "
"4922490","4925570"," But the Twitch functions are awesome."
"4926190","4930290"," Like Twitch, like the, the functions that they have, you can like remove a screen, remove the chat."
"4930430","4933470"," You can play it in the background while you're doing something else. "
"4933470","4937890"," You can just listen to the audio and then just watch the chat."
"4938150","4942490"," There's a lot of options on Twitch at least that YouTube just doesn't have functionality, I guess."
"4942950","4946190"," A lot of a lot better interaction, that kind of stuff. "
"4948730","4949390"," But you did."
"4952280","4953760"," Okay, so they can't watch them."
"4953900","4957140"," So my, on my end, it says it deletes my videos after six days. "
"4959120","4963520"," So I'll have to find out why it says that right now it says six days, they delete videos."
"4964960","4966100"," That's what it says at least."
"4969240","4971120"," Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just reading that wrong. "
"4979320","4981340"," Is it the time limit setting?"
"4982060","4983400"," Yeah, I don't know for sure."
"4983720","4987900"," On the back end, what I see is your video will be deleted after six days."
"4989660","4991120"," Or it won't be saved any longer. "
"4992560","4994640"," And I don't know the answer definitively."
"4995020","4998500"," I'm still extremely new to Twitch."
"4998820","5000800"," It's like going to YouTube for the first time ever. "
"5007360","5011340"," So I've got an error on YouTube."
"5011760","5015760"," Hold on a second here."
"5015760","5017220"," YouTube streaming issues. "
"5020850","5022230"," Right now, as a matter of fact."
"5026160","5027600"," Are you experiencing anything?"
"5027740","5031940"," If you're a YouTuber right now, are you experiencing any kind of stream issues?"
"5044830","5046010"," Still good on your end."
"5051540","5053560"," It's on my end at 1109. "
"5053860","5058320"," It just said YouTube is not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming as such viewers"
"5058320","5059740"," were experience buffering."
"5060140","5065200"," If you see any issues on the YouTube side of things, let me know and I'll reset the entire stream."
"5066920","5068940"," I'll reset my router if I have to. "
"5069960","5071200"," And not my router."
"5071440","5076240"," No issues on your side."
"5076420","5076520"," Okay. "
"5080180","5083960"," Just let me know because we don't want to be middle of the rate hike."
"5085060","5086340"," And not be ready for it."
"5093260","5093900"," Hey, Winky. "
"5094120","5097000"," Is it possible to you guys are saying here?"
"5111940","5115580"," One, one, two, three is asking, do you have a video for your chart set up?"
"5115760","5115860"," Yeah."
"5116040","5125060"," Every morning, I post on at captains alpha, a private handle on Twitter, the levels for the day."
"5125580","5129380"," So if you follow that Twitter handle, it's got private handle, but I'll let you in. "
"5129420","5130680"," I just try to keep the bots out of there."
"5131600","5136180"," And every morning, most mornings, 98.8% of the time."
"5136180","5139840"," Well, you'll get the levels every morning for the major indexes. "
"5139840","5143000"," You can pop those into your own trading platform."
"5143500","5148660"," And then if you show up every morning at 9 30, most mornings around 9 30 10."
"5149760","5152760"," I come on stream and I set this chart up with you. "
"5152820","5154880"," You'll see the levels usually are already there."
"5155300","5157980"," And then I tell you where the implied move is."
"5157980","5163740"," I'll tell you where support and resistances on velocity and triggers. "
"5165100","5168440"," And so you should be able to follow along at home."
"5170280","5171100"," Good question."
"5183490","5184390"," I got you, Wooten. "
"5184850","5185090"," Yeah."
"5185310","5190870"," Follow on at captains alpha and show up early in the morning and we'll get you all squared away."
"5191050","5194830"," Another thing, Wooten would be here if you're new to the channel. "
"5204160","5207880"," If you're new to the channel, Wooten, you definitely want to join the discord."
"5207880","5212260"," There are some admins and moderators in there that will get you all set up."
"5212940","5216900"," If you want to follow along trading every day, trade against me, do whatever you want to do. "
"5217280","5219440"," But it's a way for you to integrate yourself into the community."
"5221220","5223140"," Same thing goes for YouTube."
"5228440","5232140"," There is a discord invite for youtubers out there. "
"5238340","5243300"," Yeah, the YouTube error message is sponsored by Twitch, right?"
"5247560","5248080"," Okay."
"5248460","5250020"," Fernando was asking my anti Bitcoin."
"5250520","5251200"," No, not at all. "
"5251620","5254040"," I was an early Bitcoin adopter."
"5254380","5257100"," I sold way, way, way too early at a Bitcoin."
"5258440","5263300"," But if you want to see BTC, we are in talks right now with some people. "
"5263840","5267100"," So we're doing, we're going to start doing recorded videos every day."
"5268020","5269720"," It'll have full market coverage."
"5270600","5272460"," So you'll see every night, you'll see coverage of Bitcoin. "
"5275820","5276860"," Hey, thanks, Eugene."
"5277160","5277840"," I appreciate it, man."
"5279340","5280380"," No worries, brother. "
"5280540","5284780"," I appreciate you, uh, subbing through the prime sub, even though you're watching on YouTube."
"5288720","5291360"," Uh, foresight finance, saying these blocked on discord."
"5292260","5294240"," Uh, we'll try to get foresight finance. "
"5294680","5301180"," Uh, I don't know what your situation is, but I would ask you to do is to try to contact"
"5301180","5301840"," one of the mods."
"5302420","5307840"," Uh, they're trying to restructure, uh, unbaning people, giving people a second chance."
"5308720","5311860"," Uh, so definitely check back with those guys. "
"5316740","5318280"," Yeah, the prime thing is kind of weird."
"5318280","5328080"," Um, you go to, you go to, um, prime, like Amazon prime, you go to gaming and then you, I"
"5328080","5329100"," think it's like prime gaming."
"5329700","5334660"," And then you look up for Twitch, like just do a Google search Twitch prime gaming or something on"
"5334660","5334900"," Google. "
"5337610","5344370"," It's a C-A-P-T-A-I-N-A-L-R-S, captain's elf at captain's with us."
"5345870","5347450"," I'll post that for you right now."

"5357080","5362040"," bank and SBB says it's too early to tell where the new legislation will be necessary. "
"5364220","5368660"," Uh, also cap, if you can enable that setting in discord, we can become discord partners."
"5368660","5369880"," What did I miss there, Winky?"
"5370220","5371320"," I missed something from your brother."
"5376990","5379210"," So you want me to, you want me to enable partners?"
"5382920","5384440"," Which setting in discord, Winky?"
"5385260","5385980"," I missed some of the chat. "
"5390490","5391370"," It must be a thing."
"5391510","5392590"," I have like years of video in mind."
"5392790","5397750"," Winky is saying a years of video in his, uh, must be a setting. "
"5399170","5399690"," Time limit?"
"5400170","5400890"," Is that what I want me to do?"
"5400950","5401550"," The time limit setting?"
"5409460","5410040"," Two FA."

"5487780","5489320"," Stephen H is saying hell no."
"5489480","5490300"," YouTube is way better."
"5490780","5491540"," So Stephen H."
"5491900","5493360"," Uh, what are your, what are your reason?"
"5493620","5494240"," I've heard both people. "
"5494240","5497860"," I've heard both people have preferences with valid preferences."
"5498240","5499300"," Why do you think Stephen?"
"5499420","5500620"," Why do you think YouTube's way better?"
"5501420","5502100"," Let me know."
"5502880","5504140"," I'm interested to see why you think so. "
"5507040","5508880"," Yeah, the Twitter handle is private."
"5509160","5510200"," But all you do is follow it."
"5510640","5514380"," And then I go in every morning and I let everybody in. "
"5514380","5516180"," There's so my public handle."
"5516840","5520820"," There's a lot of fake captain Jim James handles on Twitter."
"5520960","5523840"," Some of our regular handling on Twitter. "
"5524740","5526740"," Um, you can just Google search me."
"5526820","5527520"," It's captain Jim James."
"5527600","5529560"," My Twitter handle itself is kind of wonky. "
"5529700","5533220"," It's at Jim James 74888138."
"5534180","5538200"," But it gets copied with scam accounts and bought accounts all over Twitter."
"5539120","5545040"," And when I have a private handle, I don't get that those scammers inside of that handle. "
"5558800","5561880"," So I have another question for you this morning as we wait for the decision."
"5562500","5566250"," I have some other stuff for you out there."
"5571230","5572790"," Well, I got a bunch of stuff to do. "
"5573170","5575750"," That's the other thing that I did totally forgot about this."
"5576630","5577950"," I took the advice."
"5581930","5582990"," And I canceled. "
"5586010","5588550"," Matter of fact, I have to request a refund."
"5591170","5595430"," I canceled the pay for scroll down here."
"5596270","5599250"," Late last night, it was perking me so much. "
"5599430","5600210"," I'm like, fuck that."
"5600390","5602810"," I'm like, I'll just get some defined RSS feeds."
"5605510","5609270"," So I'm like, I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to cancel this. "
"5609530","5612330"," Now I got to, I got to track them down and be like, I want my money back."
"5613110","5616350"," I paid 20 bucks to have every 15 minute updates on."
"5618210","5621850"," On my, uh, on my data scroll, my, my, uh, news scroller. "
"5623950","5625350"," Like, you know, I'm like, they're right."
"5628840","5630040"," What am I looking for?"
"5630460","5631000"," Think tight here."
"5635440","5636240"," There we go. "
"5656350","5659730"," Yeah, deckhand Doug, Dougie is making a very good point."
"5660290","5664690"," Uh, Twitch, the one thing about Twitch is that the live feed is not delayed like YouTube."
"5666350","5668530"," And the gamification of Twitch is fun too. "
"5668670","5669270"," I agree with that."
"5672140","5676020"," Yeah, this is the first day with a first fed day with me on Twitch, isn't it?"
"5677180","5679540"," You know, I didn't think about that the first time."
"5682820","5685040"," Yeah, and you know, it's making that same point right now. "
"5686440","5700520"," I can"
"5700520","5701620"," go in here and see."
"5703880","5705660"," Having some YouTube issues in the background."
"5705960","5707200"," YouTube's all angry right now. "
"5708300","5710720"," Not have YouTube is not happy at all."
"5718900","5720040"," Let me see what they're saying."
"5720320","5728840"," Uh, is it worth the extra cut they take?"
"5729060","5729400"," I get it. "
"5729480","5733060"," If you don't make much off of subs and members, but when you're making lots of members regularly,"
"5733060","5734360"," then YouTube is way better."
"5735000","5736940"," Yeah, I agree with that statement, Stephen."
"5738000","5739200"," The weird part about. "
"5740320","5742140"," The weird part, Stephen is that."
"5744260","5748600"," I really want all subs to like at some point, I'm going to have to delete."
"5748800","5753180"," I'm going to have to cancel all the subs and direct everybody to a website. "
"5753200","5757980"," So I'm not sharing subscriptions with Twitch or YouTube."
"5759260","5764660"," Yeah, that's a working on the background because we pay so much out to you pay pal to Twitch to"
"5764660","5764880"," YouTube."
"5764880","5766540"," You're like, the split is insane. "
"5767620","5770680"," So at some point, the subscriptions will just move over to our website."
"5772680","5773880"," So you have direct support."
"5774420","5782590"," Yeah, I agree, Stephen, 100% saying YouTube equals traffic, equals growth. "
"5785090","5785910"," That's a huge difference."
"5785910","5789370"," People get a lot of subs or members just saying, yeah, I agree with you, Stephen, 100%."
"5791390","5793450"," I was going through my numbers. "
"5795610","5801510"," It's weird, like YouTube, they really like, like YouTube is like, they love a recorded video."
"5802130","5804330"," Like, so I live stream every day."
"5804330","5808850"," If I were to just make a video every night, they would be much happier and make way better revenue. "
"5809990","5814230"," If I was doing recorded videos, like live streamers on YouTube, they're just like, fuck you, go get"
"5814230","5814590"," out of here."
"5816150","5816990"," It's kind of weird."
"5819370","5824390"," They love like people be able to come back and schedule recorded videos every night, that kind of"
"5824390","5824590"," stuff. "
"5846050","5847850"," Yeah, even how they set it up."
"5854020","5857100"," Yeah, I saw the shadow banning."
"5857500","5860060"," Who is talking about getting shadow banned trading fraternity?"
"5860940","5864180"," At one point, talk about getting shadow banned on YouTube too, right?"
"5869430","5872410"," Yeah, he's saying he remembers to check out the stream when I tweet it. "
"5878450","5880730"," Hey, Capshaw, switch to Twitch."
"5891400","5892400"," What if I schedule?"
"5892720","5896180"," Yes, we're so we're going to build into the new website."
"5896280","5899260"," It's going to have it built in like scheduled live streams. "
"5899560","5901140"," You need the SEO for all that stuff."
"5901140","5906080"," So as soon as the website is live, it'll be scheduled."
"5906960","5911660"," You need like the cross platform schedule, but still makes no difference. "
"5913460","5914600"," Still makes no difference."
"5915320","5921600"," If you look at what live streamers on YouTube capture for an audience versus what recorded videos"
"5921600","5923080"," do, they're completely different."
"5929180","5932100"," Way more revenue posting on YouTube videos, absolutely. "
"5933140","5935880"," Because they stay relevant, like people come back and watch them."
"5936020","5937760"," They'll watch for the next day, they'll watch a month before."
"5938320","5943080"," If you had in videos like classes, or if you had in videos about a topic, people will come back"
"5943080","5944860"," and check on those videos for years. "
"5944860","5951680"," And even my recorded videos have like 15,000, 30,000, 40,000 views."
"5953340","5956260"," 60,000, well, I've got once four clip series."
"5957000","5962700"," Matter of fact, they got another video and another handle that got 70,000 views in a day or"
"5962700","5963300"," something stupid. "
"5964420","5967500"," I stopped posting there and I was all recorded videos."
"5967760","5969040"," Recorded videos are key clutch."
"5978520","5980340"," There's a weird algorithms in the background. "
"5982080","5984620"," Coffee shop, John subscribed on Prime."
"5985260","5985760"," Thank you, brother."
"5986720","5989680"," Casey Kepshaw, Steven Williamson, subscribe on YouTube. "
"5992450","5993790"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"5994010","5999110"," If Winky is listening right now, Winky, I still figured out how to do a streamlabs."
"6000210","6003330"," Twitch and YouTube poll. "
"6004150","6007030"," I don't know why I haven't figured that out yet."
"6008270","6009910"," Like the streamlabs bot poll."
"6012090","6015450"," And rate that one down too because every day I forget to do it in the morning. "
"6016230","6021290"," But if you could ask a question to both Twitch streamers and YouTube streamers, ask them."
"6022190","6031410"," Do they think we get 50 BPS, 25 BPS, a pause for a cut today?"
"6033730","6039370"," I'd like to see what everyone thinks about that, the results of that."
"6039370","6042650"," I'm interested to see what the sentiment is here. "
"6045800","6050880"," Johnny Rose beef, subscribe and with Prime, baby."
"6054550","6058830"," It says, hype train, sub gift or use bits to get to the next level."
"6066300","6070640"," Yeah, Chase Winters saying we should do, we should grab some call spreads for say tomorrow or"
"6070640","6074100"," Friday, like 408, 410, if they do the Volcrush pump. "
"6075260","6076800"," Yeah, Chase, I think it's on the table."
"6076800","6083820"," I think what you're looking for today is what you're looking for today, Chase, is this will be the"
"6083820","6085040"," siding factor down here."
"6086000","6091900"," So we want to be watching for like the, if we get weakness down here, is it just a by"
"6091900","6092320"," the dip?"
"6093260","6095500"," Volcrush call spread for Friday here. "
"6096460","6100920"," Or we blast down below this implied move and hold below it."
"6100920","6107520"," If we hold below this, this implied move down below, probably not a good bet to take call spreads"
"6107520","6109160"," into Friday, but I agree with you."
"6109820","6114560"," Chase is, Chase is saying to you, hey, you know, we don't want to get caught in reprising of"
"6114560","6114900"," options. "
"6116320","6120880"," But if you do want to grab those call spread, Volcrush Friday calls."
"6122860","6124260"," It all matters."
"6125360","6128560"," What matters here is we have taught, well, first off, we have time. "
"6129020","6134000"," We know for, I'll guarantee you, I'm going to guarantee you unless it's some crazy, like, unless"
"6134000","6138860"," it's some crazy, unless you hear some crazy, like we're cutting or pausing rates, which would"
"6138860","6140000"," probably get leaked early."
"6142500","6148520"," Unless it's something like that, you're waiting for that, for that ball to come in after, you know,"
"6148760","6150180"," let's say, let's say we get 25 BPS."
"6153120","6154920"," And everything seems honky-dory, right?"
"6155240","6157080"," And you give this like little rip face ripper up here. "
"6157940","6160640"," And then as soon as we, well, let's hold on a second here."
"6162520","6164340"," And Chase is asking a fair question."
"6164340","6169140"," So, you know, you get that face ripper up the failure and then all of a sudden you see everyone,"
"6169260","6170300"," everyone's all bullish. "
"6170940","6175780"," And then we come into the, the, um, presser part of the, part of the day."
"6176840","6180120"," And you see that bleed off and then you see the horrible questions coming in."
"6180480","6184260"," And it's down here that you want to pay attention to. "
"6184400","6189220"," Like after that, after that two 30 hour, do we pay attention to, do we break, do we slip under"
"6189220","6189560"," here?"
"6191000","6193120"," Or is it some kind of a buy up into the bell?"
"6194340","6197080"," And that's kind of where you're looking at for that call spread."
"6199080","6200040"," Volcrush into Friday."
"6200300","6203500"," Timing on that, Chase, is going to be important. "
"6207050","6208470"," No worries, uh, wait."
"6217820","6223400"," Another issue is what Volway showed on Twitter yesterday about how you get big down moves after of"
"6223400","6225840"," expiration on OPEX and FMC."
"6225840","6232860"," Yeah, that's my one concern, Chase, uh, is where VIX is, right?"
"6233220","6235480"," We want to see VIX come up today. "
"6237520","6242140"," So you want to see VIX crank today at some point."
"6242580","6244020"," You do need to see VIX crank."
"6244240","6246380"," If you don't see VIX crank, there's an issue. "
"6248240","6251280"," Now, VIX will go hand in hand with today's moves."
"6253300","6254780"," They agree with that as well, Chase."
"6280610","6285490"," US Senator Warren asks the Fed to crack down on large regional banks, according to CNN. "
"6285930","6291530"," Yeah, I think ultimately this switch is over to, I think ultimately, we're going to, I think on our"
"6291530","6297650"," side, ultimately, we're going to scrap anything from, like, associated with Twitch and YouTube in"
"6297650","6304130"," terms of subscriptions and just roll it all over into the website."
"6304130","6306070"," So if you're like, hey, I want to support the stream."
"6307330","6308610"," We have an option for you. "
"6308610","6315070"," Just go to the website and you can sign up for a monthly subscription."
"6315350","6318610"," It's like five bucks or something, two bucks, whatever it is."
"6318770","6324050"," And then you get invite links to any extra content, that kind of stuff. "
"6334190","6337250"," Yeah, I think you have to hit, uh, I think you have to hit I vote, right?"
"6337370","6337910"," Is that what you have to do?"
"6339470","6343010"," You have to do it not I, sorry, a few exclamation mark and then vote."
"6345630","6350610"," And then it'll allow you to vote on the, uh, where do you think that we're going in the market?"
"6359240","6362860"," All right, so next question for you, trying to get all this stuff."
"6363620","6370600"," We tagged the H line that's done next target above 436 on the market. "
"6370600","6372780"," Uh, I've got some questions for you here."
"6372860","6374240"," I want to go over one quick thing here."
"6374860","6375940"," Just a second here. "
"6378400","6382300"," Vic's getting a little bit of a, of a bid here as well, even though we're going higher."
"6392100","6397420"," Get the Fed rate decision at 2 p.m. We've got Fed Chair Presser at 2 30 p.m. On"
"6397420","6401260"," Thursday, we've got claims at 8 30 continuing claims at 8 30."
"6401580","6406980"," So, you know, that's another thing here, uh, Chase is you've got more volatility, man. "
"6406980","6412100"," Tomorrow morning at 8 30 that trade might not be until early morning on, on Thursday."
"6412860","6416920"," Friday, we've got durable goods, uh, bullard speaking at 9 30."
"6417060","6420020"," A durable goods at 8 30 and we've got, um, bullard at 9 30. "
"6420800","6425040"," Uh, we've got U.S. Services PMI at 9 45 on Friday as well."
"6425380","6427060"," Man, this could kill the market right right on the weekend."
"6428040","6430200"," And then maybe, maybe next week it comes in. "
"6431080","6432340"," We got nothing scheduled for Monday."
"6433260","6435560"," Uh, we've got advanced retail inventories on Monday."
"6435560","6443440"," Uh, we've got the FHA, the FHA home price index. "
"6444880","6447080"," Pending home sales on Wednesday."
"6447740","6451960"," And then we've got, uh, the 30th get DDP second revision claims on Thursday as well."
"6452440","6455040"," Continuing claims, uh, then we've got Friday. "
"6455240","6458100"," We've got personal income PCE core PCE."
"6458300","6459480"," Those have made a difference."
"6459800","6461700"," That's next Friday, the 31st. "
"6461860","6462980"," And don't forget next week."
"6463460","6465380"," We have some kind of volatility coming with."
"6465380","6469820"," A set of hearings where they're going to try to explain, explain away, uh, what they're going to do"
"6469820","6471600"," to backstop or change these banks. "
"6472020","6475380"," Give them new rules and I still money from, uh, the pours."
"6480450","6481650"," Now I want to ask you."
"6482930","6483410"," I was re. "
"6483670","6485150"," I was going through my."
"6485750","6487690"," I want to ask you out there."
"6488310","6493230"," I was going through my tweet deck and I deleted all of my tweet deck. "
"6493490","6495650"," And then I don't like what I replaced with."
"6496950","6500710"," When I followed on tweet deck, we go through this and remove these two."
"6501550","6502630"," Remove this one. "
"6503390","6504390"," Remove this one."
"6505530","6506610"," Remove this one."
"6507190","6508990"," And I wanted to refresh my tweet deck. "
"6510210","6510730"," Move."
"6511910","6512790"," Okay, so on tweet deck."
"6515190","6520270"," If I was going to follow somebody on tweet deck, I'm going to ask you, but if you have tweet"
"6520270","6520890"," deck open. "
"6520890","6525310"," Uh, for people that post on Twitter."

"6546010","6548790"," Or not like them, but does it help on to have this?"
"6549110","6551690"," Because what I'll do is I'll read their stuff on stream here."
"6552450","6558950"," So let me know in the chat who your favorite Twitter follows are for live market coverage."

"6588990","6591410"," I think I follow RT gamma, but I'm not sure."
"6596520","6598720"," I see a bunch of different RT gammas here."
"6602560","6603480"," Nope, that ain't him. "

"6630560","6630680"," there. "

"6709050","6709810"," I'm not seeing him either."
"6711830","6714590"," Maybe I'm not hitting the, uh, trading."
"6717230","6717430"," Nope. "
"6717570","6718370"," Not seeing him either."
"6722030","6723810"," Short seller ST is badass though."
"6724790","6726070"," See, at Mark Dow. "
"6732980","6733880"," Don't know him."
"6734020","6734740"," I don't follow him."
"6737100","6738880"," Look at his, look at his account though. "
"6739260","6739940"," At Mark Dow."
"6740420","6741460"," Mark Dow."
"6748220","6752280"," He says, he says today, whatever the decision today will be the dumbest one in the history of"
"6752280","6752860"," central banking. "
"6754320","6755740"," And he shows cat pics."
"6756000","6756680"," I like that too."
"6757980","6759040"," And dog pics. "
"6768110","6768630"," Yeah."
"6768730","6770610"," So I've got no issues with Mancy."
"6770750","6772510"," This is, let's go back to the original question. "
"6773610","6776170"," Let's not, let's not get out of tangent here."
"6776730","6779150"," I'm trying to rebuild a tweet deck."
"6779930","6784710"," So I'll keep up like six columns for people that post. "
"6785910","6790550"," Uh, I don't know, market news or actionable, like where they're trading at that moment."
"6791290","6792950"," I don't care about after action reports."
"6793070","6796050"," I don't care about market briefs in the morning. "
"6796070","6797370"," I don't care about any of that kind of stuff."
"6798510","6801550"," Uh, this is for you, for me to read to you guys in live stream."
"6802590","6805250"," So if someone's post, I know froggy trades does that. "
"6805310","6806190"," He's like, I'm long."
"6806330","6806610"," I'm short."
"6806910","6807110"," I'm out. "
"6807290","6807570"," I'm flat."
"6808210","6808650"," Fuck this mark."
"6808790","6809590"," I'm taking the day off. "
"6809830","6813210"," That kind of shit's like shit that I'll read to you and be like, Hey, froggy trades is doing this"
"6813210","6813450"," today."

"6825880","6827280"," I'm looking at his stuff right now."
"6827340","6827960"," I like what he posts."
"6829100","6830280"," He's got like dog pics. "
"6830840","6831760"," He's got weather stuff."
"6841230","6841630"," Yeah."
"6841670","6844750"," I got nothing bad to say about a man's scene. "
"6844950","6848410"," Uh, but his tweets are, you know, they're not really actionable."
"6855640","6857520"," Let's see what you guys got in here and YouTube."
"6858480","6860600"," Uh, alpha DM for us. "
"6861120","6862540"," Did you check your alpha DM?"
"6862780","6863360"," No, I will though."
"6864200","6866000"," I'm friends with all of the ball wins."
"6866140","6866540"," He's awesome. "
"6867520","6870620"," Uh, at max Anderson at max."
"6870620","6871460"," I don't know him."

"6880860","6882220"," At max Anderson."

"6887880","6889320"," At max Anderson. "
"6893000","6895520"," Uh, I don't know if it's at max Anderson."
"6896060","6896720"," Maybe it is."
"6896880","6897180"," I don't know. "
"6901090","6902010"," Uh, nope."
"6902210","6903310"," He's from 2023."
"6904730","6905750"," Nope, not that guy. "
"6906710","6907170"," Nope."
"6907170","6907290"," Nope."
"6907370","6908430"," I can't seem to find him. "
"6908710","6913510"," You might have the, uh, I don't know who that guy is."
"6913590","6914810"," I can't find him on tweet deck at least."
"6916090","6916930"," I'm Jim Kramer. "
"6923990","6925250"," I like him too."
"6926050","6927790"," I like VV vault Disney too."

"6971660","6973960"," I'll read where you guys are saying right now in the chat."
"6974160","6974460"," It's hilarious."
"6975660","6991050"," U.S."
"6991110","6996610"," Senator Warren has asked the Fed to crack down on large regional banks sources at CNN say. "
"7003840","7006780"," Crack down on the rules they were following."
"7007600","7010840"," Oh, you got to love it."
"7011340","7012380"," You got to love it. "
"7013640","7014820"," You got to love it."
"7016480","7023680"," We got Nvidia trading like a penny stock trading $2.71.58. We got Apple with a new high at"

"7078440","7081520"," Just looking for that consolidation in GME right now."
"7081640","7083340"," We'll see if they actually get her if it loses momentum. "
"7084300","7085240"," XLF man."
"7085860","7087080"," Be careful here."
"7087560","7092020"," I'm in a warning warning to you right now that XLF is looking like it's about to crash. "
"7093020","7095100"," So be careful in the spy right now."
"7095100","7097000"," This can be very detrimental to the spy."
"7097400","7098420"," Just a warning to you. "
"7099140","7102940"," XLF right now is extremely bearish at the moment."
"7105600","7107800"," Same's going on with KRE right now."
"7108320","7115700"," So we've got regional bank panic setting in with that comment from Senator Warren. "
"7119900","7121140"," She is senator right now."
"7121160","7121860"," So yes she is."
"7122980","7124460"," It's not paying attention to her. "
"7125280","7131380"," XLP getting a bid where XLU was kind of like some rotation from XLU to XLP."
"7132120","7134120"," USO pulling its pants back up."

"7151210","7155910"," HYG interesting right watching that big bid on HYG in yesterday's close. "
"7156610","7157970"," And then not so much today."
"7158130","7159950"," We'll take a look at HYG in the back end here."
"7160630","7165010"," Amazon a virtual finance. "
"7165570","7167770"," What's going on virtual finance man."
"7168770","7177630"," V.I.R.T. Netflix not showing not showing bullishness like it should snap still bullish"
"7177630","7179430"," consolidating looking for higher highs."
"7180330","7182890"," DIA not looking too sexy right now is it?"
"7183090","7184630"," DIA is looking shortable. "
"7187920","7189920"," BBY still can't pull its pants up."
"7189920","7193480"," Of course you're seeing BBY with retesting lows from yesterday."
"7194840","7196060"," Oh, UNG. "
"7197360","7198320"," Oh man."
"7198700","7200220"," Let's get our gas lotos on."
"7200480","7201420"," Look at UNG. "
"7201680","7203900"," I bet you're all a pumped on UNG right now."
"7204460","7206020"," Let me look in the background at UNG."
"7209350","7209870"," Nope. "
"7210070","7210190"," Yeah."
"7210430","7210690"," Nope."
"7212270","7212790"," Nope. "
"7212790","7212850"," No."
"7213190","7213450"," No."
"7213950","7216050"," I got nothing for UNG. "
"7216250","7218310"," I guess the UNG crowd those probably thinking there is."
"7219090","7221070"," I don't see anything yet on UNG."
"7223210","7224790"," It's got more work to do. "
"7228470","7229690"," And look at the."
"7232050","7234110"," I'd be watching CVS."
"7235370","7237310"," Now right now it looks like dog shit. "
"7237310","7242130"," it, but I like the consolidation in CVS."
"7244620","7246580"," Yeah, I keep your eyes on CVS."
"7248520","7250400"," It's gonna need some time to develop. "
"7254810","7260910"," SMH, semiconductors, man, still bullish, baby, still bullish."
"7262570","7264550"," Snowflake, another one worth watching."
"7267300","7273240"," Snowflake, I like snowflake right now to some extent, but there are some tight stops on it, right?"
"7273540","7280840"," But you can see demand coming in back on March or May 27th to 2022, again on the 1107 to"
"7280840","7288300"," 2022, and then January 4th of 2023 on snow worth at least watching in the background. "
"7297370","7298150"," Yeah, that's right."
"7298270","7302850"," NVIDIA and apples holding everything up right now, like smoking a cigarette and drinking whiskey"
"7302850","7304270"," while doing the rings."
"7310990","7314290"," Meanwhile, you've got XLF just bloodbath in the background. "
"7315930","7319650"," I mean, look at XLF, can it get a bottom please?"
"7320970","7326050"," Let me look at XLF on, see if XLF is a kind of bottoming pattern here or not."
"7328550","7337970"," Well, yeah, let's take a look at"
"7337970","7338570"," XLF."
"7341490","7342610"," I'll say this to you. "
"7343650","7344690"," I'm gonna say this."
"7345930","7349070"," So XLF just bounced off of its hourly trigger."
"7350370","7356810"," The hourly trigger is at 3171, and we just tagged 3172. "
"7358630","7366690"," If you see XLF at any time, it's ugly."
"7366870","7368490"," That should be bottom on XLF."
"7368930","7373690"," Like right where you are right now, that should be bottom on XLF. "
"7375270","7377290"," That's, this is the dip to buy."
"7377950","7379410"," So let's look at XLF real quick."
"7383440","7385260"," That's a mute book map. "
"7387680","7391280"," This is either going to be a positive for the market or a really bad thing"
"7391280","7402940"," for the worth"
"7402940","7404520"," at least paying attention to."
"7405900","7413920"," So XLF, such a gross man."
"7419820","7421760"," Look at that bearishness in XLF. "
"7424480","7425860"," I guess 67 percent."
"7426100","7427940"," I mean, that I don't think you can get any more bearish, right?"
"7428840","7429480"," On XLF."
"7429700","7432020"," The one thing I'll give to XLF is this. "
"7433940","7437160"," If it can hold here and it's hourly, it has to hold here."
"7440640","7442540"," It's worth paying attention to."
"7442740","7443900"," Just keep an eye on it here. "
"7444080","7444520"," 3171."
"7446240","7447400"," It has to hold."
"7447640","7450320"," You want to see the one in five minute get under here. "
"7451020","7452300"," Kind of give it a lift up."
"7453560","7456720"," So we'll look at, and we'll look at this in a large time frame."
"7460720","7465220"," But just on a larger time frame, even for all the bearishness, this is what I want you to pay"
"7465220","7469720"," attention to, is you have extreme bearishness in XLF, right?"
"7472320","7474460"," I just want you to look right here. "
"7475540","7484840"," And the way that XLF has been moving, you can see right here, starts to come bearish, and then we"
"7484840","7486280"," get a nice little lift up, right?"
"7487100","7488040"," See how we come up here?"
"7489240","7496000"," And if we can see any kind of consolidation of XLF and power trading after strong profits lost"
"7496000","7505840"," here, according to the it's a bottoming"
"7505840","7506260"," process."
"7506980","7512440"," So just don't go to say to you what an XLF would be, even though it looks extremely bearish here."
"7514360","7518340"," You can see we have higher lows on velocity. "
"7519220","7520700"," Pay attention to it."
"7523600","7531040"," If you see this consolidate here, and we don't break below that, that right here, this 3172."
"7532260","7538920"," If you can see any kind of consolidation here, and you can see this daily coming down here, Farley"
"7538920","7540200"," can take price above. "
"7541040","7543200"," I'd be interested in it above 32 bucks."
"7544540","7547640"," And worth at least watching here, at least worth watching."
"7548120","7550160"," If the hourly, the daily come together. "
"7551300","7559420"," And so if this hourly comes together with it, with this daily here and price starts to move higher,"
"7560260","7562640"," it could be looking for a pretty significant squeeze."
"7564160","7567180"," It's the monitor, monitor XLF here."
"7571330","7576010"," It could be some bottoming action in XLF, even with all the bearishness on it right now. "
"7577690","7587420"," So if we're looking at XLF, so for all that bearishness in"
"7587420","7590740"," XLF, not at no interest in consolidating below."
"7591180","7595400"," So if it starts the trade down here, I got no interest in it."
"7595560","7597360"," I got no interest in catching that knife either. "
"7599020","7607060"," If you look on a five day chart on it, we've got no interest in catching knives down here."
"7607840","7609680"," I got no interest in this down here."
"7609880","7629000"," But with that being said, with"
"7629000","7631140"," that being said, this is constructive. "
"7631420","7632320"," It doesn't look constructive."
"7632700","7634520"," I bet to you, but it is kind of constructive."
"7635700","7648570"," The one thing here on XLF would be 3375,"
"7667190","7667710"," 3175. "
"7673320","7675960"," There is a trade in here if it stays above."
"7678040","7680440"," Now if it breaks below, it's bad news."
"7680720","7682660"," This is like bad news down here. "
"7685880","7688920"," And there's some really vicious daily coming down here."
"7689120","7696530"," So my point here is that 3370."
"7696830","7697630"," Yeah, right up in there. "
"7700430","7706470"," If it can kind of try to get back up in here and though daily can come underneath, there might"
"7706470","7708310"," be a retest down below here."
"7711170","7712930"," No guarantees in this trade."
"7713550","7715190"," Something to watch over time. "
"7728640","7732240"," If it can hold its pants up here, something like this."
"7742950","7746490"," Now if this starts breaking down here, right, the trade is dead."
"7748350","7751130"," I have no interest in catching knives down here. "
"7751190","7755310"," I would be interested if it can show itself, you know, it comes back down retest and then maybe"
"7755310","7757490"," take it this trade long to get up here."
"7757970","7761410"," Now some kind of rejection because of the daily coming down, right?"
"7761670","7765230"," Then daily would sweep underneath, the hourly would come up underneath, then you'd have the white"
"7765230","7768390"," and the red line right here and possibly pick this back up over here."
"7769390","7771350"," XLF, at least it's at least worth watching. "
"7772710","7776370"," Now if we have a bad day in the market with Jerome, all bets are off."
"7779210","7780810"," All bets are off because this can go the other way."
"7780910","7783470"," This can go, it's going to become a, yeah, fuck you, we're out of here. "
"7783590","7784730"," We're going way down to the depths of hell."
"7784910","7791190"," We're going to print 20 bucks because there is a target down below 20 on XLF, but just be aware"
"7791190","7791470"," of it."
"7792670","7798000"," There is a bull's trade in here somewhere on XLF. "
"7799220","7800720"," Now bulls need that too, right?"
"7800720","7804860"," Bulls aren't going to get higher without that trade developing over time."
"7811560","7813420"," Coiling, nothing going on in the spy right now."
"7813720","7814760"," No movements at all. "
"7815740","7827230"," It's now 11.56. We have two hours until chance"
"7827230","7832550"," to buy calls down below, chance to buy puts on the high up here so you don't lose too much"
"7832550","7834830"," on theta burn as we head into the refed rate decision."
"7854890","7857730"," Let me see if I can read anything coming out of Twitter right now."
"7857990","7859270"," I'll give you guys a quick update on Twitter. "
"7877610","7879290"," What was the, uh, winky?"
"7879470","7888140"," What was the, what was the, yeah, XLF's going to buy."
"7888900","7891000"," It could still go down a little more."
"7892100","7894400"," There's a larger trade chase above. "
"7896360","7901420"," What, like once we, once we consolidate and get above the hourly in the daily, there's a, there's a"
"7901420","7902460"," huge move higher there."
"7903660","7904960"," It's going to take some work."
"7909040","7911300"," Pull closes at 12.50 right on, brother. "
"7911560","7912760"," No, no, no, leave it going, man."
"7914040","7915460"," I think 12.50 is great."
"7916080","7922480"," I think my only concern was, my only concern between now and then would be, uh, does the market"
"7922480","7923800"," start to make it to move higher here?"
"7923900","7926800"," Does the hedges start coming off now or not?"
"7931580","7932460"," Had no big deal. "
"7941510","7943990"," If I'm going to look for myself here, maybe a trade."
"7946010","7954310"," We got four, oh, two, four, oh, two, four, oh, two,"
"7954670","7957990"," $1.43 right now."
"7962470","7965070"," And I still have, I got 392 puts still. "
"7971780","7975200"," And I got 365 to expire today."
"7979780","7981700"," One, one 42 for four, oh, two."
"7990040","7990620"," All right. "
"7991720","7993680"," I'm going to take a quick break here."
"7993740","7994980"," I'm going to leave this up with you."
"7995160","7996580"," I'm going to leave the live stream on. "
"7996820","7998200"," I'm going to put on the background."
"7999080","8002380"," Uh, I'm going to put on some news in the background here for you."
"8003700","8020400"," Hold on"
"8020400","8020820"," a second here. "
"8036200","8038140"," I'm going to take a quick 15 minute break."
"8038980","8040240"," I'm going to go potty."
"8078660","8079480"," Hold on here. "
"8093210","8117020"," It's submerging the forward to"
"8117020","8122000"," working toward a fine, this is with relevant stakeholders and the details of these plans."
"8126360","8162600"," No, just"
"8162600","8163160"," thinking here."
"8173350","8179710"," 84% probability of a 25 base point hike, but that's actually below the 100% level that we're using"
"8179710","8182530"," going to be meeting with on the day you have an announcement. "
"8183290","8185670"," The Fed is expected to hike 25 basis points."
"8186070","8190130"," You can expect the Fed chair to say banks are well capitalized and talk for half."
"8190170","8190830"," I'm going to leave this time. "
"8190870","8191889"," I'm going to take a five in a break."
"8192090","8192790"," I'm going to go potty."
"8193450","8196610"," I'm going to grab, uh, do I need to grab anything for this?"
"8196930","8199370"," Probably some more water. "
"8209709","8211670"," What Fed chair Powell says here."
"8211770","8213290"," The market is priced in the tent."
"8213410","8214790"," I saw that, Mr. Talking Monkey. "
"8215450","8216790"," Eddie Temple layer cake."
"8217049","8217690"," I like layer cake."
"8218150","8221650"," So there could be sharp rate movements for a market that is priced right now. "
"8221990","8222750"," There's the 440."
"8223129","8229510"," Yeah, T and a fed that currently predicts that the year end will be 513 and could turn the volume,"
"8229510","8229870"," please."
"8229910","8230230"," Okay. "
"8231090","8236209"," 37 with the question also of stocks are begging and cutting and unprepared for a fed that still"
"8236209","8238889"," sees itself batting an inflation in the year ahead."
"8239110","8239990"," He's going to be listening."
"8240389","8245290"," Let's go back in the five minutes and how much concern he expresses about the potential for the"
"8245290","8250170"," recent bank turmoil to drag down the economy growth and reduce inflation. "
"8250650","8255469"," That is how much of the feds go to reduce inflation is accomplished by the banks, right?"
"8256850","8257370"," He's stick around."
"8257469","8260230"," We know you got a big meeting at two o'clock, but I want to stick or have you stick"
"8260230","8263530"," around so we can bounce a couple of things off you really quick want to bring in the committee"
"8263530","8265990"," right now Liz you're sitting right here to my left hand side."
"8266490","8272090"," Steve broke out some numbers, 83% chance of a 25 point hike, 17% chance of no change at"
"8272090","8272209"," all. "
"8272510","8273230"," What camp do you follow?"
"8274610","8279389"," First of all, I don't think we can separate monetary policy and financial stability at this point"
"8279389","8281850"," after the events that have occurred over the last couple weeks."
"8281870","8286549"," I think they are now hand in hand and they're going to continue being hand in hand until we finish"
"8286549","8287650"," this rate hike cycle."
"8288590","8293930"," Steve is absolutely right that we usually come into these meetings with a pretty clear idea of what"
"8293930","8294430"," we're expecting. "
"8294809","8298490"," I think 83, 84% is still pretty clear of an expectation."
"8299750","8303790"," What's going to be the risk and I say this every time that we have a Fed meeting, I mean"
"8303790","8304889"," it even more today."
"8305230","8309530"," The most dangerous time to trade the market is between two and two 30 p.m. Eastern time. "
"8309870","8313790"," You get the data at two, you get the dot plot at two, you get the economic projections at two,"
"8314270","8319350"," he starts talking at two 30 and almost inevitably reverse whatever that first move was."
"8319809","8325670"," So this is a time where we literally have to sit on our hands, watch it happen, listen closely."
"8326590","8330430"," I think that probably there's an excuse to do both things. "
"8331290","8336170"," What I would say the responsible thing to do here is to pause, say that we're waiting for more"
"8336170","8338990"," data, leave it open to possible hikes later on."
"8339309","8345049"," Find out if this does have as much of a disinflationary effect as they're expecting, and then do it"
"8345049","8345250"," again."
"8345990","8347809"," I don't think that that's going to be the case though. "
"8347910","8352110"," I think he's got clearance to hike by 25 because of the rallies that we've seen over the last few"
"8352110","8352290"," days."
"8352510","8356549"," All right, Liz Young 25 point hike, wait and see approach to trading until at least after two 30"
"8356549","8357250"," Eastern time."
"8357530","8358629"," Joe Turnover, where do you stand?"
"8359030","8360250"," Well, I agree with Liz. "
"8360510","8364790"," The market has given the federal reserve the opportunity to raise by 25 basis points."
"8365010","8365350"," That's clear."
"8366190","8370309"," I still go back to the experience of the Orange County bankruptcy in December of 94. "
"8371209","8374309"," Federal Reserve raises one more time after that by the middle of 95."
"8374309","8375309"," They're cutting rates."
"8375850","8382290"," I also believe that the rally that we witnessed in the market now introduces an element of surprise"
"8382290","8385770"," which previously didn't exist in the last several days. "
"8386290","8392190"," Now the surprise is if the Federal Reserve is far more hawkish than we are expecting, then you will"
"8392190","8397150"," see a dramatic impact on the market and obviously a negative one for that."
"8397150","8401930"," But what they should do is really sit back and pause."
"8402310","8406190"," I think as I said the other day, they're going to be criticized in either direction. "
"8406750","8409970"," If he raises 25, he'll be called John Claude Triche."
"8410350","8411990"," If he does nothing, he's off and burned."
"8412190","8414630"," So he's going to be criticized in either direction. "
"8415430","8423030"," Can I ask Joe and Liz who are arguing for a pause and in my presentation just a minute ago,"
"8423030","8428550"," I talked about the potential and I don't know that's going to happen for the Fed to ratchet up the"
"8428550","8431150"," outlook for 2023 to 537."
"8431310","8435350"," Guys, even to that three bar chart in the back that I used earlier, that's a potential."
"8435810","8440250"," It wouldn't take only a couple votes to go that way and I just want to know, Joe, does the"
"8440250","8441050"," market freak?"
"8441730","8446310"," If the Fed goes the other way and said instead of a pause, it really says we're going to do"
"8446310","8446930"," more this year. "
"8447570","8449330"," Yeah, that's the surprise, Steve."
"8449570","8450690"," That's the hawkish surprise."
"8451270","8458510"," Given that the market has rallied 4.5% for the NASDAQ and the S&P basically 3% the"
"8458510","8461010"," last five days, the market is not prepared for that. "
"8461350","8466850"," I also think what it doesn't do is remove the most important condition for the market and that's"
"8466850","8467830"," the interest rate volatility."
"8468550","8470870"," How do you relax the interest rate volatility?"
"8471710","8472490"," That's really significant."
"8473150","8479130"," Last point on all of this is understand the stress in the mortgage back security market right now. "
"8479670","8482770"," That is extremely intense."
"8483310","8488430"," Silicon Valley Bank is 58 billion in MBS that if they want to raise liquidity, they're going to"
"8488430","8488610"," sell."
"8488810","8491030"," So they're going to sell alongside the Federal Reserve. "
"8491490","8494110"," How is the Federal Reserve at this meeting going to address that?"
"8494450","8500150"," The need to sell MBS to raise this liquidity at a time where the Federal Reserve is no longer the"
"8500150","8503850"," marginal buyer for these mortgage back securities because they want to sell with them."
"8504570","8505350"," Give me one second."
"8505510","8507610"," While we still have Steve Leeson, we're going to lose him in just a few minutes. "
"8507930","8512270"," Steve Leeson, I just want to run on your point for a second about possibly the Fed continuing its"
"8512270","8512970"," rate height strategy."
"8513210","8515670"," I know there's five new voting members this year."
"8515750","8517310"," They all move with the Fed for less than a year. "
"8517430","8520630"," Are those the wild cards you're talking about that might lead to this outcome that a lot of people"
"8520630","8521270"," aren't talking about?"
"8521490","8522630"," I think there is a potential wildcard."
"8522670","8525050"," We got five freshmen voting this time around."
"8525210","8531590"," We've got a bar and Cook and Jefferson on the board appointed by Biden and Logan from Dallas and"
"8531590","8532050"," Goolsbee. "
"8532210","8533990"," They've all been with the Fed less than a year."
"8534270","8539130"," They've all been at the Fed during a time when we didn't really able to answer the question, are"
"8539130","8539970"," they hawks and does?"
"8540150","8543310"," Because everybody was a hawk, inflation was high, the Fed was hiking aggressively."
"8543910","8544550"," Wasn't any question. "
"8545070","8546350"," Now there might be a question."
"8546850","8551510"," On the other side of that business that we don't know and there could be some uncertainty about"
"8551510","8557130"," either the vote today or the dot plot today or speeches in the future whether or not they're more"
"8557130","8559990"," concerned about the disemplacing or the impact of the banking system."
"8560470","8566510"," There's also Powell, who is by the way, statistically, he is Mr. Consensus. "
"8567190","8572150"," We looked it up today and there have been fewer descents on a percentage basis with Powell than"
"8572150","8574490"," there were under Greenspan, Bernanke and Yellen."
"8574690","8577570"," I don't number the number of votes, but it's only three percent."
"8577710","8582550"," It's half of what it was for Bernanke Yellen, which means he will change the statement or do what"
"8582550","8585150"," he has to do probably to keep more people on board. "
"8585330","8586830"," So there's a lot going on behind the scenes."
"8587190","8588570"," Give us a second."
"8588690","8590750"," Let's get over to Steve Weiss and give us like five more minutes. "
"8590910","8591790"," I know you've got to get out of here soon."
"8591910","8592590"," Give us five more minutes."
"8592710","8594210"," We want to get your reaction to somebody. "
"8594390","8596050"," I don't think anybody calls Mr. Consensus."
"8596350","8598450"," Steve Weiss, we want to get your take and see."
"8598590","8599810"," Steve Weissman, please stick around. "
"8599990","8600150"," Okay."
"8600350","8602530"," Thank you for probably identifying me as a leader."
"8603030","8603770"," That's easy to do. "
"8604590","8607790"," So, well, here I say the Fed is going to go 25, I believe."
"8608250","8613470"," If they don't go 25, the message that they send is that, hey, maybe these banks are in trouble."
"8613470","8615450"," This dream is sponsored right to the tick. "
"8615890","8616710"," It's a great day."
"8616850","8619070"," It's a point for Bernanke and market trouble."
"8619310","8624750"," We'll see it by signing up by 20th the economy and the people that can less, that can reach the"
"8624750","8626370"," forward rising prices. "
"8626970","8627690"," So I think they do go."
"8627850","8630610"," But the message really will be in the dot plot."
"8630990","8632970"," So what is that going to tell us?"
"8632970","8634470"," That's what you've got to look to. "
"8634770","8639390"," And I do believe that feds got dual mandate, which is employment and inflation."
"8639850","8642870"," So they're going to pursue their policy and long act."
"8643010","8645550"," Now, they're also responsible for the financial health of the banks. "
"8646150","8649010"," But I don't believe that's an issue right now."
"8649350","8654730"," You have two notorious examples, one principle, one which Silicon Valley bank of poor risk"
"8654730","8655070"," management."
"8655550","8661430"," It's not up to the Fed to make the policy decision based upon their risk measure. "
"8662830","8669150"," So I think that they go ahead, I think that the policy decision interest rate, I think it's kind of"
"8669150","8673330"," absolutely that in six months, the feds can start cutting rates."
"8673770","8676670"," It's usually a year after last increase."
"8677510","8678810"," So that's my view. "
"8678990","8680450"," Hopefully I didn't disappoint you from it."
"8680990","8682090"," Steve, why is never this one?"
"8682250","8682770"," Steve Lee's man."
"8682930","8684350"," Are we so happy down there in DC?"
"8685030","8685970"," I am still here, sir. "
"8686390","8688250"," What's your take on what Steve Weiss had to say?"
"8688710","8692090"," He's saying inflation insidious and that's what the Fed has to make."
"8692250","8692730"," It's never one priority."
"8693470","8696350"," Yeah, well, first of all, I wouldn't call the market pricing asinine. "
"8696350","8701130"," I would call it confusing and perhaps not correct in the sense that you look at that rate outlook"
"8701130","8702850"," chart and you see those cuts built in."
"8703150","8705850"," I'm not sure it's the right call here."
"8706670","8710130"," But really what it comes down to is two things that we don't see. "
"8710610","8713710"," We can't see the flow of money in the banking system."
"8714250","8719810"," Powell can see that if he sees that there's money still fleeing the regional banks or some of these"
"8719810","8724690"," other banks going into, he might be more concerned than we are right now because he's seeing that"
"8724690","8725830"," flow of funds right now."
"8726230","8731330"," The other thing is that we don't know what the ultimate impact is going to be of what people expect"
"8731330","8733150"," to be tighter credit standards. "
"8733710","8737290"," Ultimately, Steve, that is a disinflationary impulse to the economy."
"8737810","8739390"," It has always been less lending."
"8739570","8742290"," It might mean, by the way, higher interest rates for your loan. "
"8742930","8748270"," But that also means less borrowing and that could mean fewer jobs and less inflation down the road."
"8748390","8751710"," So we don't know that he's going to have to take a gamble with that, that he can deal with"
"8751710","8754430"," that later when it appears and not preemptively."
"8755070","8755970"," Steve, it's Joe. "
"8756170","8760750"," So on the surface, the debate ranges 25 basis points are a pause."
"8761130","8763150"," But the real stress is on balance sheets."
"8763710","8766490"," How does the Federal Reserve chairman address that?"
"8766750","8769790"," How does he address my concern with mortgage backed securities?"
"8770510","8775230"," Do you think that he's going to give us any guidance on what he may or may not do with"
"8775230","8776690"," the balance sheet as we move through this?"
"8777110","8780650"," So Joe, I'm not sure that this solves your problem with mortgage backed securities. "
"8780650","8787370"," But remember, the Fed is offering you a one year loan at par, not you offering banks a one year"
"8787370","8790410"," loan at par for your mortgage backed security, right?"
"8790890","8794270"," At the one year OIS, spread plus 10 basis points as the rate."
"8794410","8798610"," So it's like 470, 480, something like that, maybe a little bit lower today because of what's"
"8798610","8798790"," happened."
"8798930","8802390"," But any event, you can take that on your balance sheet. "
"8802410","8807830"," You can finance it for a period of time that removes the concern on your balance sheet, at least"
"8807830","8808290"," for now."
"8809170","8815470"," I think that he takes the information that he has about what's happening in the banking system,"
"8815870","8817810"," tries to overlay that on the system, Joe."
"8817970","8820570"," I don't think he's going to panic here. "
"8820770","8824710"," And I don't know what to do with Steve's idea about you don't want to show panic."
"8824710","8829610"," Look, if the house is on fire, you call the fire trucks, no matter what it shows about what's"
"8829610","8830530"," happening inside the house."
"8832170","8833810"," All right, Steve, Lisa, we got to leave it there. "
"8833930","8835350"," It's been a good time, not a long time."
"8835450","8836690"," We know you got to make your way over to the Fed."
"8837150","8838410"," Thank you, as always, for joining us. "
"8839350","8841750"," All right, so Steve Weiss, I want to come back over to you."
"8841890","8844050"," You're saying inflation is the number one thing they have to tackle."
"8844310","8846190"," The street is sponsored by our ticks right now. "
"8846230","8849590"," We know right now we know ticks right now is you to actually hear what it's going to play, which"
"8849590","8852750"," is for us and still find a free trial."
"8853330","8855650"," Right, go to go for about the house on fire."
"8855650","8858050"," Isn't the house smoking at least right now?"
"8858690","8864530"," I don't believe it is, but but obviously power is a lot more for informed than Steve than anybody"
"8864530","8866550"," here because he's seeing the actual flows. "
"8867010","8873990"," All I can key off of is what we've seen so many bank CEOs come out and say, we're picking"
"8873990","8874510"," up deposits."
"8874570","8875570"," We know that's true."
"8875630","8881610"," We can see that that the equity market has rallied back providing some comfort because while the"
"8881610","8885350"," Fed doesn't care about the equity market, people do when they hear it every day. "
"8885770","8886890"," Oh, the Dow finished up higher."
"8887190","8888870"," Oh, Microsoft's up another 3%."
"8888870","8891070"," So then that gives them some comfort. "
"8891630","8894790"," So my bet is that you don't see a disaster."
"8895050","8901750"," You don't see stresses in the bank system and that the Fed gets back to or stays on course with"
"8901750","8901970"," inflation."
"8902550","8907230"," Now, of course, the power is seeing something different, which he could be, although I ascribe a"
"8907230","8910250"," small chance at, then they should pause, right?"
"8910570","8913070"," Because you don't want more runs in the financial system. "
"8913390","8914310"," But where are you going to go?"
"8914490","8915210"," You can go in treasuries."
"8915570","8917450"," We saw a big move in treasuries, saw rates."
"8917830","8919770"," We're seeing rates move back up, right?"
"8919910","8921310"," So the 10 years move back up. "
"8921570","8927850"," So I still think it's focused on inflation and I going back to cutting rates in six months, you"
"8927850","8928910"," don't want that to happen."
"8929070","8933950"," Because if that happens, that means the economy has gone into more of a tailspin, right?"
"8934130","8936870"," And the Fed has to react by cutting rates."
"8937490","8938950"," So and I don't think that's going to be the case. "
"8939150","8941990"," So that tailspin metaphor, you're not the only one putting it out there."
"8942170","8947110"," JP Morgan's Marco Kalanovic using that same kind of unsettling metaphor saying a soft landing now"
"8947110","8951050"," looks unlikely with the airplane and a tailspin and engines about to turn off."
"8951310","8953030"," Liz Young, are we at that point right now?"
"8953150","8955570"," And if so, is it 25 bases point high?"
"8955690","8956410"," Is that the answer?"
"8957330","8961870"," I don't think we're in a tailspin now, but I disagree with Stephen in the sense that I do think"
"8961870","8963870"," that there's smoke coming out of the house. "
"8964330","8965910"," These analogies are going to drive us all crazy."
"8966370","8972530"," But look, it may be the case that we don't see more headlines of the same nature, right?"
"8972750","8974710"," Of the deposit fleeing nature."
"8974850","8980150"," It may not be that it's regional banks, but I do think that this was the beginning of exposing what"
"8980150","8984330"," is a universal problem for the market and for corporations right now, which is liquidity. "
"8984670","8988550"," And the fact that we sucked all the liquidity out of the system very quickly on a number of"
"8988550","8989070"," different levels."
"8989510","8992330"," And the market moved very quickly in response."
"8993030","8996990"," So this liquidity issue, I think, will continue to show itself in different ways. "
"8997370","8999270"," Look at things like high yield spreads, right?"
"8999590","9003710"," Up 100 basis points just in the last couple of weeks because of what's going on."
"9003710","9009010"," So for a long time, I've thought that there's some sort of credit event out there, whether it's"
"9009010","9013950"," companies trying to refinance debt that was taken out when rates are very low and they can't quite"
"9013950","9015030"," make those ratios anymore."
"9015250","9019770"," I don't know what the next big headline is, but I feel confident saying that I don't think we've"
"9019770","9021550"," seen the end of the headlines. "
"9021670","9025050"," I just don't know that it's going to be the same type over and over again."
"9025290","9029450"," I still think they will have to cut not for a good reason, but I think they will have to"
"9029450","9030190"," cut before the end of the year."
"9030250","9033630"," Maybe not three times, but I think we'll see at least the 25 basis point cut the quarter. "
"9033630","9036950"," So you bring it all back to the equity markets."
"9037410","9038830"," That's why it continues to be bearish."
"9039230","9044470"," Because everything you've said, everything Steve said, everything Joe said, whether it's liquidity"
"9044470","9048450"," crunch, whether it's smoke coming out of the house, all it means that earnings are going to"
"9048450","9055490"," decline, that the market P.E. is unsustainable and actually is sort of ridiculous that you've seen"
"9055490","9061810"," multiple expansion in the face of truly declining economy with best best case, believing that poll,"
"9062050","9064590"," which I don't believe that rates will be cut in the 60s. "
"9064590","9069890"," How do you explain the resiliency though in the equities market with all the negative news, all the"
"9069890","9071670"," negative events of the last 10 days?"
"9072450","9075670"," It's remarkably surprising how strong we are."
"9075950","9079770"," You know, I think there's a lot we don't understand how the smart ones, whether it's the increasing"
"9080250","9085090"," of algos, whether it's that index funds on more than 50% of every equity."
"9086230","9087210"," Just don't know. "
"9087470","9092770"," I mean, it just doesn't trade on how we all grew up in the market on fundamentals."
"9093490","9094070"," Fundamentals."
"9094090","9094970"," It's a satiable appetite. "
"9095670","9096690"," That's bullshit too."
"9096910","9100390"," Focus on the single data point in a set of bull shit."
"9101290","9104030"," I've posted this stuff for you guys on Twitter. "
"9104970","9109890"," They've bought the they've been buying the dip on four P.E. ratios since the 1970s."
"9109890","9116370"," All these guys are like 60 years old, 70 years old liars liars."
"9116950","9123170"," And these guys that came to the market in the mid 70s liars fundamentals out the fucking window in"
"9123170","9124250"," the 1970s. "
"9125050","9126090"," Fundamentals my ass."
"9127310","9131550"," All right, we're going to talk about something here."
"9131710","9133110"," I think we talked about this yesterday. "
"9133990","9135950"," Uh, fundamentals, man."
"9136270","9141370"," Oh, man, these these these guys talking about fundamentals here."
"9141510","9144550"," When I was a boy, and I had to take the bus. "
"9145310","9147250"," I was climbing hills in the winter time."
"9147410","9153410"," We had we had, uh, arctic dogs and no such thing as we had the first elevator in the state"
"9153410","9154550"," back in 1978."
"9154550","9156130"," I'm like, this is all bullshit. "
"9158550","9159510"," Absolute bullshit."
"9162370","9164170"," We're going to talk about something important here."
"9164990","9168210"," Now on on fin to it. "
"9169790","9173210"," I posted this morning, I made a post on fin to it this morning."
"9175470","9176610"," You can check it out."
"9176790","9178310"," You can look, I look me up on fin to it. "
"9178450","9190650"," Google search captain Jim James posted, uh, I made a post this morning about, uh, housing and"
"9190650","9198910"," that of all, all home purchases this past year, 25% came from investors."
"9199810","9200910"," That was just this year."
"9202010","9204850"," That's not, that's not this whole past decade of it happening. "
"9206330","9208270"," Uh, I'm guilty of this."
"9209710","9214110"," And I've over the years discussed with you here on YouTube and discussed in fin to it."
"9215790","9220410"," Uh, the waves and motions of this going on in the background of the housing market. "
"9221630","9227650"," You see black rock and large, uh, large institutions getting involved in this, right?"
"9228290","9234990"," Even in my own private, uh, uh, I'm in private forms of buyers and sellers of wholesale properties."
"9236390","9241030"," And you even see I've, I've updated you as time has passed on what happens in there."
"9241230","9245530"," And even have talked about how, uh, this year specifically, there was a lull and then it came right"
"9245530","9245770"," back. "
"9245950","9248530"," And these buyers are, are in there right now."
"9248810","9250370"," And we're seeing it right now come out of the news."
"9252870","9260210"," And with saying that, that post that I made this morning, there's this weird setup that's been"
"9260210","9261730"," happening in the background. "
"9262950","9268410"," Uh, it's important because we're creating not just a surf class."
"9268970","9272110"," I mean, the class of surfs being created right before your eyes."
"9273290","9276570"," The agreement with the fed has been broken. "
"9278390","9284490"," Of fighting inflation, uh, fighting all kinds of nastiness out there, right?"
"9284490","9292050"," That came from COVID and we had an agreement with the fed, right?"
"9292250","9293790"," In the treasury department, we're going to fight this."
"9293910","9294470"," We're going to fight that."
"9294510","9295130"," We're going to break this. "
"9295130","9298170"," We're going to break that and all that kind of stuff."
"9303360","9311380"," And the fed balance sheet, we have erased all of that work."
"9312780","9322760"," All that work has been erased, uh, to, to backstop basically banks that legally took on more"
"9322760","9327300"," risk than they should have, banks that were, these are regional banks, right?"
"9329780","9338340"," Uh, these banks also, these banks also had what exposure of up to 65% rather than the traditional"
"9338340","9340680"," banks only having 35, 40% exposure. "
"9340680","9348820"," But even then, we're better positioned than prime banks, uh, to put money in savings, to actually"
"9348820","9352300"," buy bonds when rates went higher."
"9352540","9353780"," They could have even backstop themselves."
"9354200","9354620"," They didn't. "
"9354720","9355580"," They took the money and ran."
"9358280","9360080"," Prime banks have more exposure, right?"
"9360200","9362000"," They're, they're already, they're not in some way."
"9362040","9368460"," They already have 60 to 65% of their bank backed up by people's pre rates increasing. "
"9368480","9369760"," So they have a lot of maneuverability."
"9369760","9372900"," These, these regional banks did and they didn't, right?"
"9373720","9377100"," Well, they didn't do further back stopping for themselves."
"9377300","9377920"," Did they?"
"9377960","9378460"," They said, fuck it. "
"9378560","9380620"," Well, if it burns, the burns will start over again."
"9381060","9382180"," Well, what the fed help us?"
"9383320","9388940"," And, you know, the background over the past year, you know that some people are going to get, get"
"9388940","9389540"," fucked in this."
"9389700","9391980"," You know that the poor people are going to get fucked. "
"9393980","9402440"," But it's even worse because now you've broken the agreement with everybody."
"9402920","9405100"," There's no more participants on equal, right?"
"9405820","9410280"," The banks are holding hands, the stock markets hold hands, poor people are holding hands."
"9411940","9417480"," They backstop these regional banks and they basically know that these prime banks are fucked as"
"9417480","9417720"," well. "
"9420200","9423320"," And so now they're stepping in right now to protect rich people, golden parachute."
"9424340","9427220"," Meanwhile, in the stock market, what are they doing?"
"9428420","9434440"," They're protecting the stock market and they're saying, we're going to protect 401k's for you."
"9435220","9441380"," And so if you're rich, if you're a stock market participant, if you have a 401k, you're safe. "
"9442520","9447900"," But who's getting left behind right now is, there's going to get left behind and ultimately fucked"
"9447900","9449500"," is a poor person."
"9449880","9450860"," They're going, they're doomed."
"9451880","9457540"," And doomed on a level, the fleecing of the United States of America, I don't think it's ever been"
"9457540","9459600"," as apparent as it is the past two weeks. "
"9460360","9464940"," It's being front run, the fleecing of the poor in this country."
"9465540","9470500"," Now, I know that you out there think that you're not a poor, but you likely are."
"9471740","9474360"," You likely don't make more than a few million a year. "
"9475480","9482940"," You likely have a mortgage, the second third mortgage, not likely, but a lot of you out there."
"9483020","9485960"," You likely have bills, you likely have all kinds of credit out there."
"9486400","9488620"," You likely have a wife or a husband and kids. "
"9489860","9491500"," The system is built for that."
"9491820","9496500"," And I guarantee, but a lot of you probably won't live paycheck to paycheck above your means."
"9497340","9504980"," And even you are one step away from being kicked out of this class that seems like they're going to"
"9504980","9506640"," make it with their 401k with their house. "
"9507340","9509220"," They're like above a poor person."
"9509380","9518680"," But in reality, as time passes, your risk as this unfolds, risks you to being kicked down into"
"9518680","9519520"," becoming a renter."
"9520800","9522600"," Blackrock is betting on that as well. "
"9524600","9526280"," That that's going to happen to you."
"9526380","9531420"," So you might think that you're not a part of this class of pours, but more than likely you are."
"9531600","9539000"," And if you watch the range of who's poor and who's not and the difference in who has wealth and"
"9539000","9543940"," who doesn't, it's vastly, it's the disparity is just growing and growing by the year. "
"9545180","9550240"," And when you see 25% of all purchases going to investors this year, that is insane."
"9550240","9555820"," Now you'll see some people out there saying, yeah, it's coming, coming, housing crash, fuck."
"9555960","9556680"," No, there isn't. "
"9557220","9564500"," There's a coming surf class of people that make enough money out there, but are still part of the"
"9564500","9564800"," pours."
"9565380","9567820"," They're not actually as rich as they think they are."
"9569640","9577280"," And even today, this decision by the Fed is basically saying to you, it's basically saying to you"
"9577280","9579720"," this, basically saying, hey, look, this is what we're at right now. "
"9581840","9586880"," We protected the banks and we're going to protect you, the 401k holder."
"9587580","9588980"," Seems like your housing is okay."
"9589840","9591260"," And we're going to protect the stock market. "
"9591400","9592560"," We're going to fuck the pours now."
"9593700","9595360"," And the truth is this agreement is broken."
"9596580","9600620"," The truth is that you're now going to be told not you, but a poor person, a real poor person,"
"9600860","9601560"," people think they're poor. "
"9603060","9605160"," They're basically going to be shoved down their throat."
"9606420","9607900"," We're not all in this together."
"9610830","9614750"," And you're going to you're going to be dealing with inflation longer than you expected. "
"9615350","9618430"," You thought you were going to break this down between 2023 and 2024."
"9619270","9620050"," Sorry, buddy."
"9620650","9621430"," That's out the window. "
"9621990","9623290"," It's now five to 10 years."
"9624550","9625670"," Oh, and sorry, buddy."
"9625790","9626730"," You thought we're going to cut rates?"
"9627510","9628750"," That's now five to 10 years. "
"9628790","9630910"," You're going to get rates, you're going to get inflation."
"9630910","9635490"," And if you don't think you're going to see a spike in inflation off of what they just did this"
"9635490","9636930"," past two weeks, it's insane."
"9637930","9640350"," It's insane to think that we're not going to see a spike in inflation. "
"9641950","9646730"," Now, we can hear all the talk today and the jabber and the blah, blah, blah, all this kind of"
"9646730","9646950"," stuff."
"9647450","9651710"," You can see that the Fed's fund rate is saying, hey, we're going to cut rates."
"9653610","9659150"," Now, in my view, the only thing the Fed can do is either start cutting checks for people. "
"9659670","9661210"," And that sounds crazy, right?"
"9661830","9663530"," Like checks for poor people."
"9664390","9667170"," Here's your bailout while you deal with inflation."
"9667650","9669990"," But that sounds crazy, but they're not going to do that. "
"9671490","9676770"," So you're hoping as a market participant that they're at least going to fail out the stock market"
"9676770","9678470"," with a rate cut or a pause, right?"
"9679170","9681990"," And market participants are like, yeah, if you won't get it today, we're going to get it the next"
"9681990","9682290"," time."
"9682390","9684370"," We're going to get it at least by the end of the year."
"9684930","9691590"," But the truth is, if you even want to keep that contract that we really are fighting inflation,"
"9691630","9695630"," even though we're backstop in the banks, we're going to fuck the pours, that means it's going to be"
"9695630","9696310"," rates for longer. "
"9697170","9698590"," There's no other solution to it."
"9699910","9701010"," Just in coming to you from."
"9701150","9705790"," So you're either going to accept as that banks are seeing many defaults, not seeing many defaults"
"9705790","9706290"," at present. "
"9706810","9710730"," The credit losses, it can happen with a lag, though, do you know, you're going to either accept"
"9710730","9711290"," higher inflation."
"9711290","9715950"," You're going to accept worse living conditions for longer."
"9717030","9719130"," So we're going to pump this shit to the moon, right?"
"9719870","9721230"," There's no way out of this. "
"9721470","9724710"," There's there's no way for you to argue that the way out of this."
"9725150","9728030"," And ultimately, who's going to get fucked to the poor people?"
"9729110","9735730"," The already poor people that make like 40,000, 60,000, 90,000, the crazy part here is that you're"
"9735730","9740710"," creating a system of services, a system of a surfdom."
"9741990","9743930"," So I'm going to have a guest on right now. "
"9744970","9746130"," We're going to chat about that."
"9747990","9751430"," That thing because to me, you know, I don't normally get angry about this."
"9751430","9755750"," I mean, I wasn't even angry about it into a week or two ago last Thursday. "
"9756550","9758850"," Not this past Thursday, the one before that."
"9759570","9763510"," You know, like last week on Tuesday, we were all like, yeah, it's felt like we've been trading a"
"9763510","9764870"," week and it's only Tuesday, right?"
"9766650","9769150"," Because we see all this stuff happening in the background."
"9771690","9772370"," Hold on here. "
"9772430","9773950"," I'm going to have somebody on here in just a moment."
"9775610","9776810"," I need to do some here."
"9777330","9780010"," What I'm usually going to call it, call it cam here. "
"9780770","9781890"," You're going to do this in the background."
"9782170","9784230"," I'm going to start Colab cam, okay?"
"9785750","9786610"," Copy a link."
"9787010","9787670"," Generate a new link. "
"9788270","9788590"," Copy this."
"9789710","9793870"," And I'm going to see if I can, I'm going to share share the main display, hopefully."
"9793870","9794490"," There we go. "
"9794590","9794950"," Stop sharing."
"9795250","9797590"," Hopefully that's not the porn display that I don't show you guys."
"9801030","9803070"," And we're going to look this guy up here. "
"9803190","9803450"," Here you go."
"9803510","9808050"," One of my favorite, one of my favorite interviewees, my favorite people to have on."
"9808570","9809570"," You know who you are. "
"9809690","9813070"," I'm sending you a link right now to your Twitter DM's."
"9814010","9815190"," Feed a join, baby."
"9817410","9823740"," And we're going to see if he's here and close that up and see if he's in there or not. "
"9825400","9830320"," But I want you guys to understand that out there, there's been a contractual break in the agreement"
"9830320","9832980"," behind who's back stopped, who's not."
"9834200","9837920"," And there are some participants and there are some people that are participating."
"9838200","9841180"," There's some that are not put that back on right there. "
"9843020","9846180"," Let me see if he's got, let me see if he got the message yet or not."
"9849500","9851300"," Let me close some of this stuff down here."
"9851300","9859330"," In the background, baby. "
"9860570","9862010"," In the background."
"9864270","9865710"," You see, oh, he's in here."
"9865790","9866310"," He's here with us. "
"9866450","9867090"," Let's see if he's here."
"9867170","9868750"," Let's see if he's, let's see if he's with us right now."
"9869970","9871070"," Let me go check on him. "
"9871390","9874910"," Oh, yeah, dude, I got that sweater, man."
"9875130","9876350"," I should have put that sweater on."
"9876690","9877410"," I've got that. "
"9877630","9878070"," Damn, man."
"9878110","9880450"," We're just under half an hour's time of our internet."
"9880550","9881390"," That thing is damn it. "
"9881450","9881670"," Say something."
"9881890","9882290"," I want to hear you."
"9882790","9884770"," Presentation with even some fundamental analysis. "
"9884770","9885490"," Say blah, blah."
"9885650","9886630"," Say check, Mike, check."
"9888310","9889530"," Hold on, hold on. "
"9889550","9893190"," Let me see if I can see it because I might have some issues here."
"9893310","9896130"," Okay, show on stream."
"9898210","9899370"," Oh, come on. "
"9900650","9901370"," Are you there?"
"9902290","9902530"," Say something."
"9903210","9904350"," Oh, yeah, you are here."
"9906350","9907550"," That's a handsome sweater. "
"9908790","9909370"," It is."
"9909470","9910390"," It is very nice."
"9910570","9912030"," I believe it was Brooks Brothers. "
"9912510","9913510"," Is it a wool?"
"9913970","9914670"," Is it alpaca?"
"9914990","9916590"," It is wool."
"9918850","9919370"," It's nice."
"9920430","9921430"," Do you wear that on the boat?"
"9923030","9928090"," Occasionally, but you know, it's usually pretty fricking warm here in the summer, and this is a"
"9928090","9928930"," thick-ass sweater. "
"9929750","9930990"," Is it cold we are right now?"
"9931190","9932370"," Is the house just blasting AC?"
"9934150","9937190"," No, it's like, it was, I don't know, let's see what it is here."
"9938470","9939430"," It's like 55."
"9940550","9941530"," Outside or inside?"
"9943590","9944030"," Outside. "
"9944510","9949450"," In the house, in the offices here, we've got it at a nice 70."
"9950610","9953490"," Do you pay for that extra on your rental or no?"
"9955750","9956630"," The AC?"
"9957350","9959510"," Yeah, is that the power of your rental contract?"
"9960090","9960850"," No, no, no, no."
"9960910","9963270"," Only water, I think, here in this place. "
"9966390","9970170"," Is your water heater on a payment plan of some kind?"
"9972070","9974190"," No, not yet, not yet."
"9974810","9975370"," That's coming."
"9978890","9981530"," Homeowners in-home services, LLC. "
"9982770","9985130"," That's what I was on Twitter this morning."
"9985350","9989210"," I was like, it would be great to come up with some kind of like a black box that you"
"9989210","9990750"," could attach to anything inside the house."
"9990750","9994570"," You could be like, okay, so we're going to do our rental and we're going to charge extras. "
"9995170","10000690"," Well, just like cars, we'll just limit what's in your rental and the rest of it's an amenity."
"10000910","10007050"," Your AC and your heat keeps us at a steady, I don't know, 68 degrees or something, 72 degrees."
"10007710","10009090"," I think all of that's coming. "
"10009830","10010130"," What's that?"
"10010370","10012210"," I mean, I think all of that's coming."
"10012450","10018390"," That's actually like, if you look, there are so many companies that came along in the last eight"
"10018390","10027810"," years or so to allow you to easily, if you go into Home Depot even, there's some company that makes"
"10027810","10033410"," a little module that plugs into your breaker box and it will tell you what each individual"
"10033410","10043050"," component of your home is consuming electricity so that it's tracking the usage on a per device"
"10043050","10045290"," basis rather than just the meter outside."
"10047610","10049970"," So you can buy these smart breaker boxes. "
"10050330","10053950"," I can totally see a world where basically they decide, you know what?"
"10054490","10058710"," I think we should turn everything as a service, especially in a rental."
"10059230","10060390"," You want to use the AC?"
"10060910","10062170"," That's where in terror on the AC."
"10062510","10064090"," That's what we're going to charge like for that. "
"10064150","10069550"," You could see some kind of a slumlord, not even a slumlord, like a house slumlord that charges two,"
"10069590","10073750"," three, eight month being like, look, these people got fanged up in the last recession."
"10074330","10077090"," They can't buy anything, and they have to live a certain lifestyle."
"10077650","10079310"," So they have the money, but not the credit. "
"10080010","10083150"," So I'm going to tell them, look, that dishwasher costs me $3,000."
"10083630","10085030"," You only get 30 washes a year."
"10085170","10089370"," You get one a day and then you're over talking to you and you're doing three or four a day"
"10089370","10090670"," with like four glasses in it. "
"10090670","10092090"," So buddy, that's not going to work for me."
"10092370","10096850"," Yeah, you're way over your usage for washing."
"10097370","10097930"," I'll unlock it. "
"10097930","10102210"," You want to add 60 or 90 a month and it's going to cost you."
"10102550","10103650"," That's going to cost you."
"10103830","10106030"," And it's going to be a one year contract. "
"10106570","10110990"," One year contract and I get to invest in myself and make, you know, I get to suck all that"
"10110990","10111810"," money off of that."
"10113170","10115230"," You buying the next dishwasher for me."
"10115610","10118950"," You buy me the next dishwasher and you get to use it. "
"10120250","10124190"," I really think that's where we're headed."
"10124390","10125670"," I mean, it just makes sense, right?"
"10126890","10130190"," When you have more than running homes than real people."
"10131150","10138010"," I mean, I live in Georgia, which based on that document or the link you sent this morning, you sent"
"10138010","10139550"," out, you know, we're number one. "
"10139830","10141170"," Yeah, we're number one."
"10141490","10147550"," So we lead cool in large corporations owning all of your houses."
"10148070","10151890"," And, you know, it's evidenced by that. "
"10151890","10161570"," Where my, where my house is around me, the homes generally sell for, you know, between"
"10161570","10166790"," between seven, well, between about 700 and 1,000 and a million plus."
"10167530","10170290"," But every home in my area."
"10170730","10172590"," Is this generally, is this pre-COVID?"
"10173250","10174510"," No, this is now. "
"10174990","10175890"," Yeah, okay, okay, all right."
"10176810","10183110"," So every home in my area now that is available, you can't buy them."
"10183610","10190030"," None of them are for sale because of the same problem we've discussed on Twitter that is almost 40%"
"10190030","10197510"," of all mortgages in America were originated between the current mortgages were originated between"
"10197510","10200530"," 2019 and 2022. "
"10200530","10206710"," So everybody's got like a mortgage at two and a half, 3% in my area."
"10206710","10209690"," So they're not going to sell while we're at six or seven."
"10210310","10215810"," And then all of the homes that are being sold at this point, there's really something wrong with"
"10215810","10215990"," them. "
"10216290","10219510"," Like they're for sale and they've been for sale for a long time."
"10219810","10221490"," And that's the reason why they're still available."
"10221790","10223670"," So there's no real home inventory available. "
"10224150","10230210"," So if you want to move into my area anywhere inside of my school district or within, you know, say"
"10230210","10235270"," 20 miles of me, you're a renter and you're not a renter in a home."
"10235590","10240590"," In most cases, the homes that were bought by individuals and are being rented, they're all"
"10240590","10240990"," occupied."
"10241590","10245870"," So the ones that are coming online are in neighborhoods that were built to rent. "
"10246150","10250950"," So in my area, there are a lot of homes that are built to rent."
"10251110","10254050"," New homes for rent is the sign in the front of these neighborhoods."
"10254050","10256930"," And you look at these homes. "
"10257490","10261150"," They are four and five bedroom homes, two and three car garages."
"10261330","10266570"," They are renting for $5,000 a month and you have no option to purchase them."
"10266970","10268110"," And that's what they're doing. "
"10268270","10268950"," They're building them there."
"10269130","10271430"," They're building them near my offices right across the street."
"10271910","10273770"," There is a town home community. "
"10274230","10275230"," You can't buy them."
"10275570","10280150"," They're renting for $3,500 a month and welcome to the neighborhood."
"10280150","10284430"," And this is very rural part of the getland area. "
"10284990","10288730"," And so I don't have a good perspective on the markets around the country."
"10289030","10292170"," I travel a lot, but I don't, you know, look around for homes a lot."
"10292390","10298650"," But if it's anything like this, this is an unsustainable situation for, you know, for people that"
"10298650","10301890"," no one's going to be able to ever own a home in this event. "
"10302110","10306490"," Yeah, I think you're making a good point here is that unsustainable for people, not for the people"
"10306490","10307170"," that own these houses."
"10307450","10308190"," I mean, I'm going to say something."
"10308190","10313470"," When I moved here to Detroit, I could buy a house from anywhere from, believe it or not, 1,500"
"10313470","10315570"," bucks to 20, 25, 30. "
"10315950","10321570"," And on the back end, renovating these houses and then trying to sell them, I was able to flip for"
"10321570","10328410"," like 100, 150,000, increase the cost of a home here in the Detroit city area."
"10328990","10329730"," But it's all changed."
"10330610","10334530"," Now, it's no less than 20 to 30,000 to buy. "
"10334530","10338710"," And then the renovations are now costing minimum of 130,000."
"10339070","10342230"," And you're automatically like, I'm going for 100% markup on these things."
"10342890","10350030"," So you're like, uh, 200, 250 in a place where a home used to go for, you know, two decades"
"10350030","10351050"," ago, 1,000 bucks. "
"10351330","10354570"," And you're talking about just artificial automatic price increase."
"10354670","10361650"," Michigan in that report had 25% of all new home sales, all home sales."
"10361650","10364470"," And this state this year was 25% were to investors. "
"10364930","10368490"," And the investor boom here is relentless, has been pauses, but relentless."
"10369610","10374230"," And then the last name, give it up on, they've been, they've given up on home sales here in"
"10374230","10374570"," Georgia."
"10374810","10377470"," They, they were like, screw this, we'll build. "
"10378190","10382870"," Yeah, there's like a force like, we were not taking anything less than this going on here right"
"10382870","10383050"," now."
"10383050","10387730"," So it's like, rapid, rapid, and even, even when you're not going to sell, let's say you don't find"
"10387730","10389510"," a buyer say, Hey, can you buy this, this price?"
"10390510","10392550"," You're then saying, well, fuck it, I'm just going to do rentals."
"10393230","10394830"," And I'm just going to charge this amount of money. "
"10394850","10398410"," It'll be the same as a mortgage for someone buying this and those renters are there."
"10398630","10399930"," And this leads into the next question."
"10400270","10404230"," The important one for you, Joe is, uh, the, so I was like, I'm going to get out of, I'm"
"10404230","10404710"," going to get out of Michigan. "
"10404810","10411130"," Now I'm like, eh, you know, maybe I'll keep, keep some of these homes because I don't know about my"
"10411130","10411670"," own children."
"10412190","10414690"," Are they ever going to be able to price into something?"
"10415250","10416570"," You'll have to leave them a home."
"10416850","10421670"," So they can either occupy it or they sell it to buy into that class they can't own a home"
"10422550","10424850"," five years or a decade from now. "
"10425270","10427830"," And we were, we were talking about what's your thoughts on that?"
"10428290","10430750"," That like, yeah, I mean, the next generation of kids."
"10432190","10434230"," It's, it's an inflation thing, right?"
"10434490","10440850"," So just look at, look at the, the quickening of inflation in the United States."
"10441630","10445950"," It is growing in a way that it hasn't for generations. "
"10446770","10455270"," And that's causing, um, you know, that's, that's causing the asset class of a home to inflate"
"10455270","10463790"," beyond the reach of many people, even with what would be before, say, before COVID would be"
"10463790","10465770"," considered a good paying job."
"10466210","10466330"," Yeah."
"10466330","10469570"," Like, let's say you get an engineering degree and you get paid 90,000. "
"10469810","10473890"," And the average for an engineer is 40 to 60 in the U.S. Let's say it's 90."
"10474130","10475110"," You're like, whoa, I got a great job."
"10475270","10475650"," I'm an engineer. "
"10476530","10478110"," Just got a college, got a great offer."
"10478430","10478930"," Not 200."
"10479130","10484150"," You're not like meta or meta or Amazon, you know, that like elite engineer. "
"10484330","10487230"," You're just like middle of the road, making 90 k out of college."
"10487670","10490910"," But you want to get something that's a starter home in a nice community."
"10491630","10492430"," What's that running right now?"
"10492650","10494650"," Three, three to 500,000, let's say, right?"
"10494650","10496430"," Somewhere in there, 300,000. "
"10497330","10498910"," Depending on where you are in the country."
"10499110","10503510"," Yeah, it can easily be, you know, anywhere between 350 and five."
"10504150","10504430"," Yeah. "
"10504550","10507890"," And so what, what are they to afford that with a wife?"
"10508210","10510250"," Let's have a wife or a husband, some wife."
"10510490","10511290"," She's a, she's the engineer."
"10512130","10514470"," He's, can he be a homemaker or no?"
"10515790","10516670"," No, no. "
"10516810","10518110"," I mean, you've got it there."
"10518210","10519850"," No one gets to be a homemaker anymore."
"10519970","10522790"," I mean, that went away in my generation, realistically. "
"10523350","10532230"," So, you know, the, the, because of the fact that, because of the fact that wage inflation did not"
"10532230","10535450"," keep up with, with price inflation."
"10537860","10538340"," Yep."
"10538460","10538880"," Do we lose them?"
"10541760","10543860"," Let's see if we can get Joe back on here in just a moment. "
"10546280","10550960"," You know, it was just on a, I was just on a Facebook marketplace."
"10551680","10554000"," And we bought, he's still here, still on screen."
"10554480","10555020"," Yeah, I'm here. "
"10555680","10557040"," I don't know what happened there."
"10558460","10559140"," You're good."
"10559280","10559520"," You're back. "
"10560420","10561140"," All right."
"10562140","10562660"," Yeah."
"10562820","10569440"," All I was saying was that wage inflation didn't keep up with the inflation of the cost of goods and"
"10569440","10571700"," homes for 30 years. "
"10572160","10577320"," And it finally like reared its ugly head in my generation, that we were trying to buy homes right"
"10577320","10586960"," after the pandemic, after the, the, the great recession when, you know, housing just"
"10586960","10589460"," collapsed on everyone that had started to buy a home."
"10590000","10592560"," So we, we got, I caught the bad."
"10592780","10593820"," I caught the worst on that. "
"10593980","10595480"," I bought a house in 2006."
"10595480","10596180"," It was hilarious."
"10597040","10605280"," And, but, but my generation, it started to show that if you and your wife don't work, you have to"
"10605280","10612740"," be in the top three to five percent of home, of earners to be able to actually have like a"
"10612740","10616920"," stay at home life or a stay at home husband and just have one group working. "
"10617520","10624760"," If you don't, if you're not in that top five plus percent, you're unlikely to be able to own a"
"10624760","10631360"," home, save for a down payment, you know, raise kids, fix cars, like all that stuff."
"10631540","10633400"," And then, and then save for retirement."
"10633500","10636040"," There's no way to be able to do that. "
"10636540","10641320"," So that was before this increase in inflation."
"10641960","10648380"," And, you know, while we did have wages growing for the first time in a long time during the COVID"
"10648380","10655580"," pandemic, because it, it forced businesses to have to compete for, you know, for employees,"
"10655580","10661920"," because, you know, right now we're at basically effectively zero unemployment, where we are."
"10662160","10665380"," I mean, everybody who wants a job, there's multiple jobs for that person. "
"10665380","10666900"," Out there in the market."
"10667100","10668200"," And so they have to be competitive."
"10668600","10673220"," I just can't imagine if I was, if I get out of college, I just met this guy, the other"
"10673220","10675520"," day my wife was looking for a new piece of furniture for my kids. "
"10676400","10679880"," And this lady had a really nice piece of furniture, right?"
"10680040","10682380"," So I get on Facebook, marketplace, look at it, go over this guy's house."
"10683000","10683880"," Guy is a doctor."
"10684960","10688840"," She's now stay at home, couple of kids, young, young children or whatever. "
"10689180","10692580"," And they had chip boxes out front and started home."
"10692740","10693520"," And they were like, we can't move."
"10693520","10694340"," We can't go anywhere. "
"10695000","10696500"," We've got too many college bills."
"10697060","10697600"," He's working."
"10697820","10699120"," I'm taking care of the kids all this. "
"10699600","10701760"," And they're kind of in this weird place of being stuck."
"10702960","10704920"," And like this, this moving up."
"10705160","10710220"," And how much money do they need with their debt to move up in class, I guess. "
"10711120","10714920"," And I just wonder about if somebody regular out there with a normal, like let's see if a liberal"
"10714920","10716860"," arts degree and you're not making 90 grand a year."
"10717620","10722420"," If your parents aren't going to give you something, how do you even start to enter the housing"
"10722420","10722700"," market?"
"10722700","10727000"," How many houses are left at 150,000, 250,000?"
"10727000","10731720"," Even at 250,000, you've got car loans, school loans, all this like."
"10731820","10738560"," You're buying a house at 150,000 that needs $100,000 worth of renovations to feel safe and"
"10738560","10739580"," enjoyable to live in. "
"10739780","10745440"," So that's the reason why they're the rental market because they have."
"10747500","10748340"," No, hold on here."
"10748420","10749880"," We're still having some issues here. "
"10763480","10769540"," You know, that's my thing is if now we're not talking about, we're not right now talking about kids"
"10769540","10770440"," or adults."
"10770700","10774320"," We're not talking about you as an adult or you being 30, 40, 50 years old."
"10774980","10776040"," Talking about this young generation. "
"10776480","10781220"," These, they'll say they're 10 years old or 15 years old, 18 years old."
"10782180","10786320"," What do they need to make it in life, I guess, quote unquote."
"10786480","10787760"," I guess I know a lot of you don't want to. "
"10788300","10789260"," So I got to mind being a renter."
"10789360","10791640"," I like being this or I like being that, like being mobile."
"10792180","10796840"," I know that 50% of people under 30 years old live at home with their parents. "
"10797020","10797840"," That's a known fact."
"10799220","10803320"," And then the question becomes, well, let me just check and see if he's back or not."
"10804520","10805880"," Nope, doesn't look like he is. "
"10807020","10809740"," Joe, if you're listening in right now, try to rejoin the conversation."
"10811040","10812260"," Go back to that through that link again."
"10812420","10813680"," If not, I'll send you a new link, brother. "
"10814440","10816100"," Does he even get him a new link to join?"
"10820110","10822010"," Let me generate him a new link here."
"10822270","10822650"," Copy it."
"10825500","10827860"," So Joe, if you are listening, I'm sending you a new link. "
"10830320","10831480"," Do we get a new connection?"
"10838220","10839920"," See if he'll join us here in just a moment."
"10843220","10844980"," Now, that's a key question here."
"10845240","10853780"," And this leads into today's Fed rate hike discussion from the Fed. "
"10853780","10857220"," From Chair Powell, and what is he doing?"
"10857220","10857460"," Right?"
"10857580","10859700"," How do you come back from saying we backstop banks?"
"10860020","10862700"," We're going to continue to fight inflation with 25 VPS."
"10863320","10865580"," That means we're all going to leave people behind."
"10866340","10871320"," You know, so he comes out there today and says to you, if Chair Powell comes out there today and"
"10871320","10874860"," says to you, there you go. "
"10874860","10875440"," You're back, maybe."
"10875620","10876180"," You look handsome."
"10877140","10879560"," If Chair goes back to you though and says, I am going to keep fighting inflation. "
"10879580","10880840"," We're going to backstop the banks."
"10881120","10882500"," We want you to all accept this."
"10882500","10885680"," And you see right now your 401Ks are safe. "
"10886380","10891400"," But we're going to keep fighting inflation that target date."
"10891480","10894380"," If you're out there looking and saying to yourself, well, they're going to keep fighting inflation."
"10895220","10898760"," We had targets of 2023 and 2023, 2024. "
"10899360","10902900"," My assumption here is that you're now looking money many years ahead."
"10904700","10905900"," Yeah, absolutely."
"10907060","10912420"," I mean, I hate it because I'm looking at it. "
"10912500","10918260"," You and I both have young kids and we look at it from the standpoint of, you know, we're when"
"10918260","10925100"," our parents were where we are, the dollar was worth overdubble what it is today."
"10926340","10933260"," And if we're and it's only reduced in value relative to the assets you want to buy with it, it's"
"10933260","10934660"," only it's only gotten faster."
"10935220","10943020"," And I don't see with the Fed positioning and and signaling how it plans to deal with the current"
"10943020","10946720"," monetary problems we have, it's obviously going to continue to print. "
"10947320","10951440"," And when they print money, it debases the value of what you have or what you've heard."
"10952080","10953540"," And we're going to just keep doing that."
"10953780","10959940"," So that's why when we were discussing your houses, what to do with them, realistically, the houses"
"10959940","10967240"," that you hold or the property that you hold or whatever hard asset that has pricing power as"
"10967240","10968940"," inflation continues to grow. "
"10968940","10978820"," Those types of assets, not a sale vote, but those types of assets will be basically a coin"
"10979580","10987040"," in the game that will increase in value as, you know, if a dollar is only worth 50 cents, then"
"10987040","10989060"," now your house is worth two dollars."
"10989560","10995340"," Like that's just the way it is because those assets will be safe or at least safer than than"
"10995340","10999640"," paycheck to paycheck or cash you're earning each each month."
"11000340","11005140"," So you just lose all power if all you have is a paycheck. "
"11005460","11011920"," A paycheck has historically never kept up with inflation in the United States."
"11011960","11015040"," I don't know any other way to give my kids a leg up."
"11015400","11020380"," I'm trying to think of some other way to be like, you're not going to be fucked. "
"11020380","11026660"," It's the only thing that I can think of to try to give them any kind of a future."
"11027120","11033460"," The way we're careening towards this is, like you're saying, like a year's pass, even even a"
"11033460","11039060"," thousand mark comes down, it still doesn't come down again to some level that's reachable."
"11040380","11047700"," I think that large corporations have learned the stability that housing can add to their portfolios"
"11048600","11057060"," in a destabilized monetary system, which ours is now and is getting worse and is, you know,"
"11057380","11059880"," basically guaranteed in the future to only get worse and worse. "
"11060260","11069300"," So they have learned that housing is a great stabilizer because housing, the cap rate of housing is"
"11069300","11075760"," great and it gets even better as money becomes worth less and less if you bought it in the past."
"11075760","11083380"," So buying housing now is a great way to protect yourself in the future because you know people are"
"11083380","11091540"," going to be in dollars terms poorer in the future and having to pay you more of their monthly"
"11091540","11093860"," income just to be in the house that you are."
"11093920","11098700"," And now we're extending the inflation fight, which props up the house market for even longer,"
"11098860","11099180"," doesn't it?"
"11099360","11100480"," Yeah, absolutely. "
"11101260","11106900"," I mean, I hate it because like all the people, anybody in this stream that doesn't own a house and"
"11106900","11115200"," would want to in the future, right now it already may be too late unless you change the way that"
"11115200","11124340"," you earn money, unless you change that method or do a real life, I quit a job to take another"
"11124340","11129260"," job at a high factor more than I'm earning today."
"11129260","11133840"," Like if you're just getting cost of living adjustments at your current work and you work there for"
"11133840","11141780"," 35 years, the chances of you ever getting a breakout amount raised so that you can actually accrue"
"11141780","11145600"," enough money for a down payment on a home is very low."
"11146120","11148780"," Not only that, that's just the truth, that's just the way it is. "
"11148980","11154780"," We were discussing, you and I were discussing what the mortgage insurance taxes and then having to"
"11154780","11158740"," keep up with that over time, you know, we're talking five, six thousand a month, right?"
"11159180","11162800"," And then, and then forbid anything bad happens to you."
"11162920","11167880"," If not, let's say nothing happens to you, no, no, no roadblock to you."
"11167880","11168640"," You don't get hurt. "
"11168660","11170660"," You don't get something tragic happened."
"11171080","11174520"," You don't get, I don't know, a sister that needs medical care."
"11174820","11176000"," Anything you can think of out there. "
"11176480","11179900"," Even then you're still only working to that to that."
"11179960","11182340"," I'm going to retire and I just made my mortgage off."
"11182340","11186280"," And now I'm going to use this money for my late care and later in life. "
"11186300","11187620"," My kids, I don't know what they're going to do."
"11187840","11190500"," So even if you're there, what do you gain?"
"11190820","11194660"," Like, how hard is it for someone to own something tangible?"
"11196380","11197640"," It's extremely hard."
"11197760","11198960"," Well, it wasn't hard. "
"11199820","11201820"," That's the reason we're where we are today."
"11202300","11208620"," It wasn't hard in 2020 and 21 and some of 2022."
"11212320","11213260"," I don't know any money on a radar. "
"11213460","11218520"," Even if I have mortgage, I still have like a hundred grand, 500 grand in real equity and a"
"11218520","11218760"," property."
"11219640","11226340"," I mean, I think that everyone realized, everyone that has power and control, realized how dangerous"
"11226340","11233280"," it was to give the keys to the masses with interest rates as low as they got."
"11234240","11236240"," Because a lot of people figured it out. "
"11236240","11246160"," They realized that when you can borrow at effectively zero plus 2% or one and a"
"11246160","11251480"," half percent, whatever the banks wanted to make, in addition to the origination fees they made,"
"11251840","11261220"," originating loans on commercial real estate or housing, like that level, most smart people knew"
"11261220","11263040"," that that was a limited time."
"11263040","11266100"," And that we were going to not stay at zero."
"11266280","11267160"," They came on. "
"11267160","11267920"," We're not Europe."
"11268140","11271160"," They came out of getting fucked over in 0708, right?"
"11271340","11274740"," Well, a lot of these people, they knew they got screwed in 0708."
"11275140","11276860"," And once they had, that's what I noticed. "
"11277180","11280880"," I noticed a lot of these home buyers were like, I remember what happened."
"11281160","11285080"," They had a little bit of a decade older than me and they're like, I went through all this and"
"11285080","11288240"," now, and even two decades, people that are older, same thing."
"11288240","11294120"," They know exactly, scoop it up while you can, knowing that we're going to end up wind up here. "
"11296500","11296940"," Absolutely."
"11297420","11299980"," And so what happens this next generation is my question."
"11300340","11305020"," I don't know that we have, I think it becomes a chase that you can never catch up from. "
"11305260","11306960"," You heard Elon say that too, right?"
"11307520","11310680"," That everything will become a service one day for most people."
"11310880","11315420"," You're going to pay for services and vehicles, stuff in your home."
"11316120","11318400"," And it will seem like a deal. "
"11318680","11323320"," At some point, like right now, we're in, it's kind of like the market before the FOMC."
"11324060","11326440"," It's just, it's spiky and crazy."
"11327100","11328280"," It'll level out at some point. "
"11328440","11335840"," But when it does, it's going to level out at a level higher than where you can feel comfortable"
"11337020","11338160"," being an investor."
"11339220","11344420"," And then you'll feel like you're in a good place by making a payment that is lower."
"11344420","11349940"," But the payment that is lower means that you have to work forever. "
"11351780","11357180"," When you stop working, when you stop working, you are out."
"11357600","11363060"," You cash out of the system and then you are no longer valued by society."
"11363940","11372740"," And because of that, you're going to end up where America is a service, where freedom is a service. "
"11372740","11374900"," You have all the freedom you can afford today."
"11375040","11376640"," If you don't pay, you're out."
"11376940","11377580"," We'll evict you. "
"11378220","11382960"," And now you're a, now you're a cert like you were saying before I came on."
"11383580","11387080"," I mean, there's a lot of places in this world where people don't own things."
"11387320","11389760"," It's usually not very good when that happens. "
"11390140","11392080"," Now you were talking about what happened in England, right?"
"11392280","11394280"," You're saying in London, your friends in London that."
"11395080","11403680"," Yeah, I have, I've had several people from the UK tell me that it's like, yeah, big balls is like"
"11403680","11406960"," such a bad and sad trajectory for the white collar post."
"11407380","11414280"," It's the, it's just look at where America wound up in the 80s for people that were blue collar. "
"11414780","11419460"," That's where we're headed for in the 2020s and 2030s for white."
"11419640","11421200"," You don't own anything."
"11422660","11423960"," And good luck. "
"11424200","11425660"," You might have a 401k at work."
"11426380","11433660"," But you'll never have a large enough percentage of your wealth to put into it to really get free."
"11434080","11439120"," Even if you're matching your important matching it out and getting your employer match, it's that"
"11439120","11440320"," there's a plan for you. "
"11440820","11450160"," But yeah, so the, the idea that that we in America are going to end up like the UK has"
"11450160","11451680"," been given to me by two people."
"11451820","11457560"," I know that live in the UK where very few people own homes and all the homes are effectively owned"
"11457560","11466320"," by a group of larger companies that, that lease in rent homes and flats in London and the major"
"11466320","11468100"," larger cities in the UK."
"11469140","11470980"," And that's just the way that it is. "
"11471140","11477400"," But they went through that in the 1970s and 80s when they were kind of going through and getting"
"11477400","11481320"," rid of all of the government owned industries."
"11482640","11487920"," When they did that, there were, there was a lot of volatility in the UK."
"11488500","11493240"," And that allowed for corporations to come in and swoop homes that people were losing. "
"11493720","11494360"," And they did."
"11494900","11499020"," And now, you know, my buddy that just moved, he just moved back to the US."
"11499240","11502780"," But my buddy that was living in the UK, he married this lady from London. "
"11502780","11508820"," Like her family, her family was pretty wealthy and they did not own the home they lived in."
"11509820","11510980"," They leased it."
"11511140","11513600"," They, they leased a house that had an orangery. "
"11513960","11517100"," And I don't even know what the hell that is, but they had one in there."
"11517260","11523500"," So it's like, like this, there was a solarium and an orangery and like all these crazy rooms we"
"11523500","11524360"," don't have in the US."
"11524700","11528280"," But nevertheless, they had those in the home they rented. "
"11528840","11532520"," They didn't own this house because there's no way anyone can own these homes."
"11532520","11535160"," Because these homes are, are so inflated now."
"11535340","11539200"," Like a small four bedroom home in a village well outside of London. "
"11540040","11545820"," One of the guys there at the, one of the trade shows that he said that if it was the"
"11545820","11552720"," first home to go up for sale in years, in this village that he lives in, and it was immediately"
"11552720","11555040"," bought for millions of dollars."
"11555060","11560020"," And it's just a four or five bedroom home in a nice little village."
"11560020","11564260"," But it's sold for a couple million bucks and will be rented. "
"11565300","11566880"," Because you can't own there."
"11568500","11571840"," Just want to make a quick interruption here for anyone that's watching right now."
"11571900","11573300"," This is a five minute chart. "
"11573980","11577120"," There's a quick one minute and five minute bare plane here, barrel plane."
"11577460","11580260"," But I do want you to just pay attention to right here."
"11580360","11587460"," If you see this cross take place, I like to watch this cross right here. "
"11587460","11589820"," And I also want you to watch this cross above."
"11590380","11593340"," As we cross over here, price rejects above."
"11595460","11597880"," There's a looking for this trade higher here. "
"11598340","11603260"," And then a rejection trade to right down to 390 plus six or so."
"11603620","11604760"," It's a P.T. down below."
"11604940","11606040"," It's going to work itself out. "
"11606260","11606820"," It's comments from ECP."
"11607040","11613440"," Now so be aware of a squeeze higher trade to possibly 398 42."
"11614100","11615160"," And then a price target. "
"11615460","11617440"," Now as a matter of fact, I was readjusting these."
"11617440","11620120"," This is the early in the daily trigger."
"11620460","11625360"," They have moved up now from lower lows to higher highs now. "
"11625640","11627880"," So I just want to be aware of that as this plays itself out."
"11628440","11631360"," I also want you to see the one minute chart and how it's playing itself out."
"11631660","11632580"," This is the one minute. "
"11632860","11634900"," Here's the bear's cross and the one minute now."
"11635600","11638480"," We're going to be looking for some kind of a squeeze and trade lower."
"11639460","11644240"," We've got a gap to fill down below here at 39769 and then 3977. "
"11644940","11646800"," But on a lot higher time frame here."
"11646860","11648660"," It's waiting to keep your eyes."
"11649700","11651640"," There's a small gap down below here. "
"11651640","11653760"," And then there's a point of a crossover here."
"11654440","11656240"," You could see that gap get closed."
"11658020","11659660"," You watch this gap get closed. "
"11660020","11662280"," Squeeze higher and then that trade lower into."
"11662680","11665960"," This is a expansionary fiscal measures risk-fueling inflation further."
"11666440","11668740"," That hourly and daily. "
"11669060","11671600"," This is again the place that bulls want to hold in."
"11671600","11673360"," This job is not done yet."
"11673660","11675120"," The bank must be bold and decisive. "
"11675680","11677900"," It says further red hikes are needed in the coming meetings."
"11677900","11679580"," It's inflation developed as projected."
"11680200","11681520"," Now the bank sector is resilient. "
"11681820","11683340"," Contagion risks for the euro area."
"11683560","11686000"," Thanks on the- What is going on?"
"11687000","11690960"," On the one minute spy is having a little low."
"11691600","11694780"," Yeah, I also want you to see in the 15 minute we get the bear's cross above with the price"
"11694780","11699320"," target down below at 396.81. And then on the hourly really quick. "
"11700020","11701340"," This is just above."
"11701920","11705400"," This is where that dip-eye is down here at 39746."
"11706180","11710940"," So mark that on your volatility or your path lower if you're a bear. "
"11711980","11712460"," 39746."
"11713320","11718080"," And for a dip-eye for the bulls or at least some volatility for you to get down here to"
"11718080","11722440"," this 396.80. There's a little bit of a 39746."
"11723520","11726660"," And then we're going to go right back to this five minute 39746. "
"11731600","11733700"," That gap has been mostly closed."
"11734900","11736960"," 39746 is right down here somewhere."
"11739920","11740920"," Right down in here. "
"11741920","11742960"," Close to the US treasury."
"11743200","11744560"," It didn't quite close that gap."
"11744760","11745820"," There's a tiny little cut. "
"11745940","11748360"," You might not be able to see the extreme here but there is tiny little gap."
"11748620","11749840"," It's linked to failing banks."
"11752290","11753490"," That's really weird I've got it. "
"11753550","11763460"," It looks like I've got um it's like I have somehow I have a financial"
"11763460","11765080"," juice even though I turned it off."
"11765220","11766140"," They're still playing in the background."
"11766620","11768140"," Sorry Joe to cut it off there. "
"11768360","11769940"," No you're good brother you're good."
"11770060","11771980"," I say I'm just being a doomsayer."
"11772220","11774340"," I'm starting to sound more and more like a bear every day. "
"11774760","11775720"," I don't like it."
"11776440","11783500"," I used to be I used to be a you know to the moon trader but the stuff we're doing"
"11783500","11789800"," in the economy is just so asinine and you know shortsighted."
"11790400","11791480"," It just it's all shortsighted. "
"11791860","11795860"," Everything everything's about political expediency right now."
"11795860","11798020"," And it's it's really hard to watch."
"11799680","11800720"," All right hold on here. "
"11800880","11803660"," I got to turn that up there to turn this up here."
"11803740","11804100"," I think they did."
"11804180","11805960"," I had a bunch of stuff playing in the background here. "
"11807880","11809560"," So you're becoming more and more of a bear."
"11809760","11812020"," So just like to wrap it up is you only have an hour left."
"11812940","11815780"," Do you think what do you think?"
"11816500","11819160"," I guess people are really interested not so much. "
"11819460","11820720"," I want to know your take on."
"11820720","11825820"," Do we get zero to two five or two five BPS we get five zero BPS."
"11825820","11830980"," Do we get a rake cut and I think can you expand if if you can if you can't you"
"11830980","11831840"," don't want to have spine. "
"11832540","11839060"," You know what matters is the con is the con is it what's in the press release is it what's"
"11839060","11842980"," in the presser is it the questions that are asked."
"11844500","11846920"," Give us your take on what you expect today."
"11848460","11855900"," Well I mean I think I think the Jerome Powell probably like I just picture him kind of like a"
"11855900","11862160"," like an old if anyone remembers the old SNL skits with Stuart Smiley where he like sits in the"
"11862160","11865520"," mirror and he looks at himself and tells himself he's good enough. "
"11866020","11868800"," He's smart enough and gosh darn it people like him."
"11869240","11872000"," Like I feel like that's Jay Powell right now."
"11872480","11878980"," Like he's gonna raise 25 BPS because he said he you know he didn't say it was pause time. "
"11878980","11888460"," And I think he realizes that he he needs he needs to raise to I guess to to wring out"
"11888460","11891600"," the last bit of credibility in the Fed."
"11892800","11900040"," But in the in in the end raising is just it's just doing the doing you know doing the doubles"
"11900040","11907400"," work about crushing you know you and me because he's gonna raise rates it's gonna make it harder"
"11907400","11911020"," for people that need money and need loans."
"11911940","11916640"," We're gonna keep inflation we're not going to raise enough to stop inflation that's for damn sure"
"11916640","11922240"," especially not while we're expanding the balance sheet as we raise rates and erasing half of the"
"11922240","11929220"," years worth or ever since we started cutting or started raising we're raised 50% of the balance"
"11929220","11931180"," sheet reduction in one weekend. "
"11931180","11938020"," Yeah so at this point we are going to we're headed towards what I was talking to you about."
"11938200","11942180"," I was like the minute I read about it the first time I was like holy shit that's exactly what"
"11942180","11942700"," we're going to do."
"11943160","11944860"," We're going to have a no landing landing. "
"11945720","11954080"," We are going to we are going to continue to squeeze rates which is going to hurt you know hurt"
"11954080","11962980"," everybody we're going to continue to have inflation we're going to crush main street we're going to"
"11962980","11967100"," crush Wall Street and we're going to ultimately bail out the banks."
"11967600","11968760"," That's what I think we're doing."
"11969080","11975820"," I think we're going to crush everybody and then they'll dip in and save the few institutions that"
"11975820","11976900"," they feel like they need. "
"11977200","11983000"," Yeah if you if you're if you make your living off of other people's money you already see it right"
"11983000","11987540"," if you go out to a restaurant or whatever you see higher priced food you go to get a service"
"11987540","11993200"," you go to get hard goods all those costs to them are being passed along to you as the poor"
"11993200","11993760"," person right."
"11994340","12000640"," So if you're a landlord if you're a you know whatever you're doing to make to make it you're going"
"12000640","12002660"," to pass all those costs down to the poor."
"12005370","12014550"," Yeah I mean so if in a no landing scenario we we we push we basically try and push the"
"12014550","12021830"," economy to grow through you know through a lot I mean obviously not not raising rates too much and"
"12021830","12028210"," going with 25 basis points or then maybe pausing which is going to allow inflation to go nuts"
"12028210","12034070"," because as you've seen you know any any expansion of the Fed balance sheet and the markets goes"
"12034070","12040330"," crazy which is great that's wonderful but it doesn't fix any of the underlying problems so we leave"
"12040330","12048690"," the cancer down right and we just we just punt to the end of the next election cycle and then"
"12048690","12050550"," we're going to crash this economy. "
"12051270","12060730"," So if we don't if we don't do something now the problems are harder later and I think that the"
"12060730","12066510"," Fed is basically signaling that they are going to listen to the requests of their you know their"
"12066510","12071050"," handlers in congress and they're going to say yeah no we're going to crash this fucking bench but"
"12071050","12076050"," we're going to do it later not now and that's where we're headed."
"12076370","12080010"," How do you think it works out politically and how it affects the market?"
"12081830","12084970"," I think we're going to get what they want."
"12085110","12089390"," We're going to fail out your foreign pay we're going to fail out the stock market because we need"
"12089390","12097450"," them to be we need them to be from 160 to 125 you're still kind of safe right?"
"12097950","12102870"," So you're like yeah before okay it's at least steady it's not it's not at 80 bucks or 90 bucks"
"12102870","12110770"," or 60 bucks apple in my portfolio it's at 125 like even right now Apple at 160 it comes back"
"12110770","12118450"," down to 130 125 what have you lost nothing right but what do you think politically happens if they"
"12118450","12122530"," say today he says they were going to keep fighting inflation and we're going to build the rich"
"12122530","12128450"," people do you think that has implications well politically I mean maybe even the market down the"
"12128450","12138070"," road into election season yeah I mean at this point we are we're whistling past the graveyard I"
"12138070","12145470"," think that I think the the average Joe on Main Street still doesn't fully understand what's going"
"12145470","12152970"," on or what these decisions they're making in their you know for them as their representatives are"
"12152970","12161590"," going to mean to their future and they're going to get you know they keep the the average Joe just"
"12161590","12167190"," knows do I have a job and are they laying off people near me and I'm worried about my job"
"12167190","12173710"," and so I think right now what they're doing is they're trying to protect just like Senator Warren"
"12173710","12180750"," was saying you know how are we going to protect jobs because that's all that the people in power"
"12180750","12186790"," currently need is everybody to have a job and there to be two jobs available for everyone looking"
"12186790","12196730"," for one that's it let me ask you the chat if you're in chat watching on twitch and youtube and"
"12196730","12202230"," let's say you're young and let's say this is a fascinating topic because I'll ask this question"
"12202230","12208270"," sometimes and I'll say hey do you have any do you want to retire someday when you're older if you"
"12208270","12212170"," even you're like I don't I'm not thinking about that cap I was I'll have people be like well I"

"12237030","12241490"," feel like and I mean I don't mean people that already own homes pre-covid maybe we're like oh just"

"12368640","12375260"," like we've like you and I discussed a while ago um there's an ongoing conversation isn't it's been"
"12375260","12382200"," developing oh my god it really has from back when I was a happy happy bull you know like we"
"12382200","12389860"," started this conversation way back then there's a squeeze happening right now in the spy uh bears"
"12389860","12393700"," are gonna want to watch this cross over here this is your place above where you're going to look"
"12393700","12399200"," for this squeeze higher and see if the bears can take us down into the hourly and daily trigger"
"12399200","12405960"," down below here did you change your one minute trigger to yellow what's that did you trade your one"
"12405960","12412820"," minute trigger to yellow no I added in a five ema for the five minute chart just so a six"
"12412820","12418340"," ema okay for the five minute charts so I could just keep track of it on bull gotcha on both"
"12418340","12422720"," timeframes people we're trading the one minute live and I was like this ain't working people we're"
"12422720","12431380"," gonna slow this down for people slowing it down slow down and you'll see it here we switch back to"
"12431380","12438640"," this one minute chart well this this white line is the yellow line on the five minute here and so"
"12438640","12442860"," in a one minute chart they're just teeing off the one minute and five minute on a one minute chart"
"12442860","12448880"," they're just teeing off right here and you'll see this if I switch back to the five minute just"
"12448880","12457330"," teeing off right now just tee it up and this looks like the the only bottom that's here in the"
"12457330","12463330"," market at least on book map demand hasn't shown itself in any lower numbers down here it's just"
"12463330","12468350"," showing itself right now right with that yellow boxes and we'll look for a squeeze higher to 398 33"
"12468350","12475690"," as this bearish crossover happens now this is not the norm right as we head into this FOMC this is"
"12475690","12480370"," not the norm that we see right around 11 30 we usually see a squeeze higher here we saw it"
"12480370","12490190"," early this morning at 10 15 not at 11 30 you're seeing the risk off appetite into the FOMC rate"
"12490190","12497510"," decision it's 114 we've got 46 minutes left until the news is dropped on us maybe this is that"
"12497510","12506700"," maybe this is some kind of a precursor someone knows something that we don't know you know the"
"12506700","12512680"," other the other thing i i'm worried about is that when you and i were talking about how the fed"
"12512680","12521840"," would raise rates to extend inflation early on like last year we were talking about the fact that"
"12521840","12529820"," obviously you have to get you have to get the fed funds rate above the rate of inflation for it"
"12529820","12536580"," to beat inflation and that a failure to do so would mean we would just have to go back several"
"12536580","12544120"," times to the well and start raising again and so um currently the reason that's another reason why"
"12544120","12549760"," i say we're going to do 25 and because we're not there yet and pal knows history and knows that"
"12549760","12555640"," the only way that you get inflation to really get under control is either to bring inflation down"

"17872900","17877840"," was before the stress in the making sector and i realized there's a lot of uncertainty but can you"
"17877840","17883000"," can you explain it all to what extent your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the"
"17883000","17888820"," board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit availability because of the stress"

"17917920","17923340"," as our policies do and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that"
"17923340","17928000"," did turn out not to be the case that in principle you'd need more ray hikes so some people did"
"17928000","17935520"," reflect that in their in their from in their scp forecasts i think there may also just have been"
"17935520","17940220"," remember this is twelve days ago you know we're we're trying to assess something that just is so"
"17940220","17946620"," recent and it's people you know it's very difficult it's so much uncertainty so December was a good"
"17946620","17952280"," place to start and we wound up with we wound up with very similar outcomes for December and it you"
"17952280","17956800"," know in a way the the early the data in in the first part the first five weeks of the"
"17956800","17961540"," intervening period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor market so that pointed to"
"17961540","17968960"," higher rates and then this this latter part kind of the possibility of of of credit conditions"
"17968960","17973500"," tightening really really offset that effectively to follow up have you consider it all whether your"

"18007340","18013360"," our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market and many banks have managed to handle them"
"18013360","18020840"," that's right i agree with that they were telegraphed in advance i agree with Politico i wanted to"

"18079660","18083680"," question we were all asking ourselves over that first weekend was how did this happen implied move"
"18083680","18090440"," in the high of 403 404 somewhere in here changed all the along with the options market we could"
"18090440","18094480"," trade higher but i want you to see this big white line up here i don't want you to see"
"18094480","18099860"," it on book map as well there's this big little block of sellers in here and uh i i get"
"18099860","18104100"," brief we'll see if we can trade higher than this zone right now we'll take a look at book map"
"18104100","18109220"," i do want you to be aware if they tag the high sometimes you come back down to grab the"

"18113920","18121040"," more highs above premiere just know you can see this supply and there's one more place above at 41"

"18128060","18133920"," wait a cr3 away to see this next tag above it's a feature not a bug but uh so but"
"18133920","18138140"," as we come in here we get one last place if you're with us all day long is isn't you"
"18138140","18142480"," know that there's another line down in here good inflation's been coming down now for six months"
"18142480","18147340"," you know there's one right above here civic and reach up and slam this but it's certainly reach up"
"18147340","18152300"," and slam this right here parsing services is is really a matter of time passing we continue to do"
"18152300","18160040"," 41 at much lower levels of inflation so that's 44 of the of the core pce index where you've got"
"18160040","18164500"," a story that's ongoing where we didn't have in February and we still coming in is about some major"

"18178340","18183600"," see that yet and that's that's of course 56 percent of the index so the story is pretty much the"
"18183600","18188240"," same i will say that the inflation data that we got to your point really pointed to stronger"
"18188240","18193540"," inflation if i could follow up on that i was curious why you don't see more coming from the credit"
"18193540","18198480"," crunch because it seems to me that's like something that you'd actually welcome to a degree and"
"18198480","18204580"," expect um and are you not seeing more coming from that because you don't know or because you just"
"18204580","18209540"," don't want to have another round of wishful thinking so it's really just a question of not knowing"
"18209540","18214700"," at this point there's a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit"
"18214700","18220460"," conditions economic activity hiring and inflation remember this right is important for you to know"
"18220460","18225360"," the question is how significant is our conversation earlier today and how how sustained will it be"
"18225360","18230020"," that's that's the issue and we don't really see it yet it's so so people are making estimates you"
"18230020","18235200"," know people creating a class of people that will be employed while they go through recession so"
"18235200","18240300"," with that we we'll talk about this in a minute it's it's creating a class of people that will work"
"18240300","18246240"," their asses on you know as conditions are tight we think about we'll have money to spend we'll be"
"18246240","18256040"," paying attention to the actual unexpected effects from that for a longer"
"18256040","18261800"," period of time thank you for taking our questions um i wonder if you could talk a little bit i"
"18261800","18265580"," know that you've got your internal review coming but i wonder if you could talk a little bit about"
"18265580","18270460"," what you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley bank and whether this suggests that"
"18270460","18275280"," something about regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward and i wonder you"
"18275280","18279300"," know how can the american people have confidence that there aren't other weaknesses out there in"
"18279300","18284820"," the banking system given that this one got missed as you noted so let me let me say what what"
"18284820","18292000"," happened and then i'll come to the questions around supervision so in a basic level uh silicon"
"18292000","18298520"," valley bank management failed badly they grew the bank very quickly they exposed the bank to"
"18298520","18303600"," significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk that didn't hedge that risk they probably know"
"18303600","18311020"," that supervisors saw these risks and and intervened they saw before you know that the public saw"
"18311020","18320380"," all this they took the money to run we know that this is a very large group of connected"
"18320380","18325740"," depositors concentrated group of connected depositors in a very very fast run faster than"
"18325740","18335380"," historical record would suggest so um as for us so for our part we're doing a review"
"18335380","18343260"," of supervision and regulation my only interest is that we identify what went wrong here how did"
"18343260","18348600"," this happen is the question what went wrong try to find that we will find that and then make an"
"18348600","18352300"," assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn't happen again so and"
"18352300","18356460"," then implement those one thing i want to make a note here it would be inappropriate for me at this"
"18356460","18361460"," stage to offer my views on what the answers might be you know i simply know the one thing you"
"18361460","18366120"," don't want to see in these in these vc companies you don't want to see them completely get shut out"
"18366120","18371960"," but that will be up to him but you want the banks to take on a hedge which isn't required"
"18371960","18376340"," is the point when transparent you're not trying to kill vc's or anything or even the banks"
"18376340","18381900"," available these vc's but you are saying hey man good to the bank you're saying look you were"
"18381900","18386500"," telegraphed to head and you did there will be recommendations coming in there was no requirement"
"18386500","18392300"," that they did what they did was they took the money and ran and the final point you know now"
"18392300","18397180"," what you don't want to see is the senate say something like yeah if you're going to be uh you're"
"18397180","18401800"," going to be financing vc's that you have to put this pre through the banking system this was a this"
"18401800","18407900"," was a bank that was in outwire in terms of both its percent no it wasn't of of uninsured deposits"
"18407900","18414460"," and in in terms of its uh no of duration uninsured deposits and again there are there are ways for"
"18414460","18419980"," you to insert outside of the fdic that's bullshit too and you could require these people to buy"
"18419980","18425240"," that insurance too if you can do that and so that's really the nature of the interview of sorry of"
"18425240","18429860"," the review is to discover that as a depositor if you're the bank say all right do you have your"
"18429860","18435860"," paperwork for your your outside money television you've been very consistent in saying that the fad"
"18435860","18440340"," would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time uh following"
"18440340","18446080"," today's decision the markets have now priced in uh one more increase in may and then every meeting"
"18446080","18453340"," the rest of this year they're pricing in great cuts uh are they kidding this totally wrong from the"
"18453340","18458320"," fad or is there something different about you're looking at it given that you're now thinking that"
"18458320","18465200"," moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing so we published an scp today as you will have seen"
"18465200","18471560"," it it shows that uh basically participants expect relatively slow growth a gradual rebalancing of"
"18471560","18475920"," supply and demand in the labor market with inflation moving down gradually this is going to be"
"18475920","18480860"," important for politics in this country that happens participants don't see rate cuts hopefully you"
"18480860","18485080"," took your profit there i would just say as always the path of the economy is uncertain and policy"
"18485080","18489060"," is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we write down on the scp but that's not"
"18489060","18496300"," our baseline expectation well if i could follow up and ask um as you look forward into the rest of"
"18496300","18505000"," the year here uh are you saying that um what you see and the 5.1 percent basically uh consensus"
"18505000","18512600"," is based on being it will be sufficiently restrictive or is it leavened by the idea of you don't"
"18512600","18517020"," know what's going to happen otherwise you don't know what should people think about in terms of how"
"18517020","18522460"," the fad takes about how far it is from the terminal it's going to depend remember we we're looking"
"18522460","18527600"," for purposes of our monetary policy tool we're looking at this is the kick in the can part of banks"
"18528360","18532420"," and asking is there going to be some tightening and credit conditions and then we're thinking about"
"18532420","18537640"," that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do so in a way that substitutes for rate"
"18537640","18543060"," hikes that's bullshit the the key is we have to have policies need got to be tight enough to bring"
"18543060","18547400"," inflation down to 2 percent they knew that was coming anyways come from rate hikes it can come from"
"18547400","18553520"," uh you know from tighter credit conditions this is covering us right now and we it's highly"
"18553520","18557800"," uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be"
"18557800","18565140"," so we're just going to have to watch uh in the meantime uh you know and obviously at the end"
"18565140","18570060"," of the day we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent no one should doubt that i"
"18570060","18574840"," am impressed they didn't brazed the inflation rate to three or five any kind of new verbiage there"
"18576480","18581320"," hi chair pal Rachel seedle from the washing post thank you for taking our questions i know we"
"18581320","18586140"," talked a bit about how Silicon Valley bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy but"
"18586140","18589720"," there's also growing concern that there are financial stability risks from the commercial real"
"18589720","18595060"," estate market and loans that will begin to roll over later this year and next and that smaller"
"18595060","18600020"," regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans is there a risk that could mimic the kind"
"18600020","18605540"," of what we saw with SPB the banks that just report risk comes out like year five another three or"
"18605540","18610360"," four years we're well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate i really"
"18610360","18616120"," don't think it's comparable to this the bank the banking system is is strong it is sound it is some"
"18616120","18620560"," but how you can't let commercial bank fail or commercial mortgage back it's periods fail tell them"
"18620560","18626080"," that i really don't see that as at all analogous tell them the truth would you be open to an"
"18626080","18631920"," independent investigation separate from the feds probe i welcome that it's it's a hundred percent"
"18631920","18636680"," certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside investigations and all that so"
"18636680","18644960"," we welcome when a bank fails their their investigations and of course we welcome that yeah we just"
"18644960","18650000"," don't want the we just don't want the senate Edward Lawrence and Fox Business inflation has been"
"18650000","18657300"," rather sticky so do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster we don't assume"
"18657300","18663480"," that we don't give advice to the fiscal authorities and we we assume that um we take fiscal policy"
"18663480","18669420"," as dipbox down below front door dipbox down below we're looking to see if we get one more dip by"
"18669420","18673280"," here or even down here responsibility for price stability the federal reserve has responsibility"
"18673280","18679280"," for that and nothing is going to change that so we have a lot to talk about as well after"
"18679280","18685180"," this time presser wraps up if i can follow on that but they're working the the spending that's"
"18685180","18689300"," happened is working against what you are doing right so it's prolonging oh here we go there's real"
"18689300","18695240"," questions you know you have to look at um at the impulse from spending because spending was of"
"18695240","18699900"," course tremendously high during the pandemic and then as the pandemic programs rolled off spending"
"18699900","18705480"," actually came down we want to see this conference ends for the ball to roll off so i want you"
"18705480","18710920"," to pay attention right now as this conference is going to wrap up shortly you should see some of"
"18710920","18720240"," that ball roll off the market here hi chair pal and you're one with axios um two questions about"
"18720240","18724940"," aspects of the government's response on Silicon Valley bank two weekends ago first why is this new"
"18724940","18730340"," bank funding facility done under emergency 13-3 authority as opposed to expansion of the discount"
"18730340","18734400"," window changing the terms of the discount window that's been around a long time and second can you"
"18734400","18739680"," discuss the Fed's role in uh in the FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there's your"
"18739680","18745060"," eyes right down in here on your balance sheets last week uh supporting that positive guarantee sure"
"18745060","18751600"," so 13-3 uh seem like the right chase if you're watching right now this is where this is your"
"18751600","18755880"," opportunity down here as we come down here chase discount window if you're looking for that"
"18755880","18759820"," opportunity to push some call spreads on in a certain way so we were talking about earlier you"
"18759820","18765640"," could be looking down here for that no magic to that it's only available in 4,000 on ES for"
"18765640","18771260"," that trade requirements but it seemed to be the right place so somewhere right down in here we're"
"18771260","18778740"," just we're lending to the in effect we're we're uh lending to the bridge bank so that's where the"
"18778740","18783200"," funds came from and it's it's a loan that's 100 guaranteed by the FDIC so there's no risk in it"
"18783200","18793080"," for us thank you chris regaver and associated press uh the scb scp suggests one more"
"18793080","18800140"," rate hike uh as does the change in the language in the statement um and which suggests that you're"
"18800140","18805020"," perhaps nearing the end of the cycle of rate hikes uh do you feel though that if inflation remains"
"18805020","18810440"," high you'll be able to resume additional hikes as needed or have you somewhat tied your hands here"
"18810440","18815700"," with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end no absolutely not no we we"
"18815700","18825560"," we we as i've mentioned we see the likelihood"

"19548710","19553750"," all curious how do you view financial conditions right now I'm not bearish on this in any way shape"
"19553750","19559050"," or form expensive enough choking off growth as you said you're watching before with that situation"
"19559050","19565470"," warrant a great cut what situation would warrant a rate cut and have the bank failures prompted any"
"19565470","19571490"," discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet run off thank you so we haven't"
"19571490","19576950"," really talked about changing the balance sheet implementation that's not something we've discussed"
"19576950","19581390"," yet as I mentioned we're always willing to change that if we concluded it's appropriate for we're"
"19581390","19588370"," really not seeing any signs there sorry then the question before that was just give me a um curious"
"19588370","19593290"," how you do financial conditions now and if credit weren't to tighten enough that that would prompt"
"19593290","19602610"," a rate cut so um financial conditions seem to have tightened and probably by more than the"
"19602610","19610550"," traditional indexes say because the traditional indexes are focused a lot on rates and equities and"
"19610550","19616990"," they don't necessarily capture um lending conditions so we think that though so there are other"
"19616990","19621390"," measures which which if they're focused there you go you know bank lending conditions and things"
"19621390","19626790"," like that they show some more tightening the question for us though is how significant will that be"
"19626790","19631390"," and how you know what will be the extent of it and what will be the duration of it and"
"19631390","19636590"," and then you know once you have once you know that there's a fair amount of research about how that"
"19636590","19642330"," how that was brought on certainty bands how that works its way into the economy we'll talk about"
"19642330","19646830"," that too what he's saying here about tightening financial conditions are not reflected in the"
"19646830","19651410"," indexes and there's a reason for that it's going to be sustained joe donut and i talked earlier"
"19651410","19658470"," about creating a class of people that have no credit extended to them but yet they have money to"
"19658470","19664410"," spend on goods and services i mentioned with rate cuts it's rate cuts are not in our base case uh"
"19664410","19671410"," and uh you know so not as hawkish and bearish as you think i promise you thank you very much"
"19671410","19676990"," all right so that's it ball off the market uh presser is over we need to we have a few"
"19676990","19683950"," things we have to talk about here so uh well you can talk about some points here no matter what"
"19683950","19690870"," they're telling you and want you to understand and know something okay the fed path whether you"
"19690870","19697810"," believe this or not is now extended uh they are kicking the can down the road i want you to"
"19697810","19701670"," know that too this is kicking that this is what called it was called kicking the can down the road"
"19701670","19711270"," there's some other scare some scariness here but not in the way that you think so the"
"19711270","19717070"," first one here is gdp we're gonna talk about gdp is looking bad right uh by the way i am"
"19717070","19725170"," long right now if you want to know uh now the gdp i think i said that earlier but just"
"19725170","19734690"," so you know the gdp projections are kind of bad down the road right we already know that now trade"
"19734690","19741570"," a dollar forty and three ninety seven c's gdp projections are bad down the road okay that that's"
"19741570","19746950"," not good now with that being said that's going to come into some politics you're going to see that"
"19746950","19752270"," impact our political system uh you're going to see people out there saying well we don't want gdp"
"19752270","19757050"," being low uh we don't and that they're going to fight for this right they want companies to produce"
"19757050","19762650"," goods and services for you to buy now unemployment is going to be another key part of this as long"
"19762650","19767870"," as they keep people employed they don't care if you have good credit now if you're a business i"
"19767870","19772170"," want you to realize you can go back you can go right to the fed and look at this come"
"19772170","19779250"," corporations do not care if credit is tightened they take loans in good credit cycles and bad"

"19814290","19821630"," going to get fucked up in this the real problem here is that poor people will be impacted you might"
"19821630","19826170"," not be able to buy a home you're more than likely not going to have credit extended to you even"
"19826170","19831410"," if you have good credit now that turns you into a renter and it puts money back into the pockets"
"19831410","19836730"," of black rock puts back and money back in the pockets of investors and he spoke spoke about briefly"

"19862250","19870370"," for a class of people that are employed at maximum employment yet are uncredit worthy even if you"
"19870370","19876310"," have good credit but these people will have money to spend while we do our thing and the scary part"

"20773490","20777130"," bull you know bears want to sell this right down it's like yeah you got up there now we're going"
"20777130","20781870"," to sell it back down here there's that three eighty that kmak is saying down below i think the"
"20781870","20788810"," bulls do try to buy this up here now on a bet on another time for time frame here let's"
"20788810","20796610"," look at something else here look at the uh daily here and i do want to warn you uh not"
"20796610","20806470"," warn you but i want to tell you this here i'm on the boat right now we're in springtime we've"

"20811170","20815530"," lower and i would like to see that complete up here and then we come in the summer months we"
"20815530","20819410"," trade down here in the early summer months over here that's what i think is going to happen so i'm"
"20819410","20825150"," looking for that dip buy down there for that continuation trade higher i'm looking for a low of our"
"20825150","20831950"," dip buy at least that let's take a look closer at it on spx some kind of a dip buy"
"20831950","20836590"," down in here maybe close the gap down here at three ninety five three three ninety five six for"
"20836590","20842890"," continuation for the bulls if that if that gap gets closed we start to reject off the daily if we"
"20842890","20848090"," get the rejection off this daily here you start trading price below we blast down and then we get"
"20848090","20853870"," the confirmation that we're going lower yell entertain that 380 down below there no problem but as"
"20853870","20860090"," for as for right now being springtime march heading in april uh i'm going to look for weakness down"
"20860090","20867710"," to three ninety five ish and then some continuation to close some gaps above here at 420 possibly"
"20867710","20877390"," even uh 430 into into april and then we'll get that slow summer right now the slow early summer and"
"20877390","20885170"," then the late push up in summer so i'm i'm down with you for some weakness uh just not as"
"20885170","20891090"," weak as you think i don't i don't think that's going to happen that's a great point came back to"
"20891090","20901060"," oh nine i love it uh what else we got here go back to uh right"
"20901060","20907600"," there and that's where we are right now right three ninety five right down in here some of that"
"20907600","20917560"," weakness right now what about the next wave of earnings do companies readjust lower to hit then"
"20917560","20922080"," market keeps going up that's a very very good question as well my fear here is that they run into"
"20922080","20926840"," earnings trading up into it and then we sell the news as we get into earnings generally speaking"
"20926840","20935500"," that's what i think is happening yeah i agree with you too came back we break so one thing came"
"20935500","20940260"," back is making a very good point here uh still very good point so let's look at uh let's look"
"20940260","20946740"," at the five day here let's just look at this five day right here so came back basically saying that"
"20946740","20952940"," the bears need to get underneath not just get underneath but they have to like sell down get the"
"20952940","20957860"," confirmation and then you get that 380 that you're looking for down here with some convictions this"
"20957860","20963540"," can happen in the overnight hours you can get this like you can get this if hedge funds can come"
"20963540","20967320"," in in a little liquidity environment they can get this and trade this to three eight it not against"
"20967320","20972620"," that trade at all uh but if you see the buyers just stepping in relentlessly in here like three"
"20972620","20977680"," ninety five they're gonna try to fucking get that move up into 430 for eight you know because you"
"20977680","20983920"," know it went March and April like the strong months for the stock market uh and then we get that"
"20983920","20988560"," lull in early summer everybody starts taking vacations and shit we're all fucking around day"
"20988560","20994120"," trading like uh 15 points up and down 30 points up and down every day meanwhile everybody's"
"20994120","20998040"," partying hanging out in the Hamptons and then we get that final like sell down and then we get a"
"20998040","21004260"," rip higher later in summer normally but just look at the look at look into spring and summer and"
"21004260","21010440"," that kind of shit uh going on here in the markets as well we'll monitor this as of right now"
"21010440","21017140"," for me this is a dip buy down below now there's 395 392 you can cut your losses down here"
"21017140","21022100"," too so the next few days here's the deal next few days we got until Monday here and we got"
"21022100","21029040"," some volatility also next week on Thursday but we're somewhere Wednesday Thursday Friday right when"
"21029040","21036640"," we get some vol i believe it's next Thursday because i think the senate hearings where that real"
"21036640","21041400"," vol is down here so if you're looking for a dip two buy it's probably down here right you get"
"21041400","21045760"," your dip buy what i don't know if it's today tomorrow or friday or even monday this is your dip"
"21045760","21050740"," buy down here and your stops are below it right this is where you take put you put your dip"
"21050740","21055840"," buy on right if we start to blast down you figure your stops and you wait to see if we're"
"21055840","21062680"," going to take this long down to 380 i like the 380 trade i just don't see it happening time"
"21062680","21067880"," of year i don't see it happening i think this is an opportunity for bulls just buy back in trade"
"21067880","21073180"," this up now if we trade 380 at any point we start blasting down here bull blast down 100 points"
"21073180","21082010"," something like that i'm down to buy that dip too yeah i think it's the sideways i think it's this"
"21082010","21087750"," weird sideways end up trade so let's look back at spx so this doesn't mean you don't get blood"
"21087750","21093650"," baths in here we know that we get blood baths we know that every year even with saying even if"
"21093650","21099950"," i'm saying to you like look at this even though i'm saying to you we're going sideways and up that"
"21099950","21106310"," doesn't mean watch these two lines right here that doesn't mean that we don't trade out of range"
"21106310","21111370"," one time that doesn't mean we don't trade down from range one time we can trade all this shit down"
"21111370","21118830"," here we can trade all this stuff in here but still trade this bullshit sideways it's it's it's"
"21118830","21126710"," really bad this is not what bulls want this is not what bears want my viewpoint well this is this"

"21675540","21681120"," here not so much the ass end down here you can get a little bit more in the downside here"
"21681120","21687320"," in kari but you want to like when we're really bullish on kari you should be coming to me and"
"21687320","21695380"," say hey cap i want a short kari so do the same same so you can like better positioning so"
"21695380","21701420"," just just leave a kari in a daily here and let's say we're trading up here getting kari you'd be"
"21701420","21704940"," like hey cap i want to take that short i'm like yeah there you go it's right there you see"

"21709400","21715980"," right there and so you want to see kari like squeeze higher maybe right get up here and then you'd"
"21715980","21719780"," be like hey cap i want to take that kari short again and i'm like fuck yeah man it's right"

"21807590","21813690"," is the other side of this trade so kari uh you still can't take a trade here as a bull"
"21813690","21818090"," you can't you can't take it right here because it could be a uh capitulation moment here so let's"
"21818090","21826830"," just look at kari in a better time frame uh you don't even want to enter this trade uh until"
"21826830","21833250"," it stops doing its thing you want it to you want it to come back up here and you put"
"21833250","21838970"," like a spread on even though this failed here this is a good example right here exactly so let's"
"21838970","21844290"," say you let's say you trade above right you get your confirmation trade you didn't get it did you"
"21844290","21849090"," so you wouldn't put this trade on unless you were there would you you actually execute the long"

"21854450","21861030"," you'd actually put your stops right below it you get stopped out of your trade uh another thing too"
"21861030","21866210"," here is if you're a if you're a capitulation bear if you're like a crash bear here just put on"
"21866210","21871350"," a ratio spread man uh if you're like we're going to crash the market here i don't know put a"
