"840850","844130"," My only my only cause for concern here is."
"845750","848790"," The only cause for concern here really is. "
"851230","869820"," Well that gap on H.Y.G. Squeezing"
"869820","870360"," higher now."
"870720","871120"," Sorry about that."
"879590","883110"," I'm going to take a profit here in just a minute as we hit this PT2. "
"905590","908290"," Day trading accounts up fucking thirty percent already."

"948890","949690"," On spoos."
"951050","955430"," Whether we close this back out then run this back down to close all this stuff up."
"957390","958810"," Then start to make our way higher. "
"959650","960430"," I don't like that."

"1053730","1055290"," traded that band right there that was nice. "
"1058430","1060310"," Trading $4.41.11 here."
"1064400","1068660"," I'll try to jump back in over here if I can."
"1075480","1076840"," I have something like that. "
"1078940","1080340"," Right up there."
"1095090","1098690"," Dixie coming in to check it's $129 EMA."
"1100050","1101990"," We're on a 15 minute here. "
"1103130","1104250"," That's where it's found support."
"1115980","1119920"," NASDAQ coming into its known previous resistance."
"1129050","1131450"," Going back to about the 15th so we're getting close. "
"1155900","1158060"," I want to see if I should buy this right now."
"1158160","1159720"," I'm like really greedy to buy this."
"1161160","1166160"," Switch over to $4.43s and try to just crank this one last green bar here. "
"1167800","1168780"," I haven't bought them yet."
"1169060","1169880"," Still sitting on the sidelines."
"1175800","1178140"," I might get left behind on this if it goes too quick. "
"1185360","1187280"," I have a green ticket in right now."
"1187340","1188160"," I don't want to be that greedy."
"1189200","1191440"," I always seem like I buy the wrong place when I get greedy. "
"1191600","1192780"," So I'm going to give it just a couple seconds."
"1194240","1195300"," Let it cool off here."
"1195500","1196780"," If I missed this last trade here. "

"1200120","1201220"," I'll be pissed off, but."
"1207210","1216990"," $4.42 trading $0.74. Maybe even jump on those if they can come down a little bit. "
"1244130","1245010"," Oh, yeah."
"1252770","1254810"," I'm so glad I didn't buy that."
"1265140","1268340"," Now I'm looking back at $4.42s again. "
"1281620","1283820"," Nice little bloodbath right here."
"1284040","1285400"," Nice little liquidation break."
"1285700","1286940"," Pull back just like that in here. "
"1287000","1287400"," We had one."
"1337750","1339990"," So we can check back the entire way down."
"1340150","1341050"," We can come all the way down here. "
"1341550","1343450"," I prefer that we don't come all the way down here."
"1345870","1349690"," Signals weakness in the overall run if we check this down here."
"1351250","1357230"," So I'd really like to see this check stay right on here and keep heading higher here. "
"1358290","1359850"," Check five minute really quick."
"1362130","1364470"," See how far up we are."
"1366150","1374050"," I mean, this says the trade is still alive for the upside, but real in reality. "
"1376350","1378610"," You want that continuation higher here."
"1381910","1383770"," Very good for the bulls right now."
"1384150","1386470"," We'll talk about that this morning as well. "
"1386470","1389150"," What this means for bulls."
"1390230","1392590"," So let's go over there really quick and just look."
"1393590","1395530"," I always like to talk about this because. "
"1406570","1407670"," Talk about this."
"1408170","1409010"," We're on the rock."
"1409190","1409270"," Right. "
"1409530","1410450"," So we're on this one."
"1410690","1414070"," So let's talk about."
"1414910","1417250"," I'm going to switch to a 30 minute time frame here. "
"1418290","1419930"," And we're going to talk about."
"1419930","1425560"," A few things here, so."
"1427220","1428180"," Positive developments. "
"1428960","1430180"," So first of all, we've got."
"1433600","1434720"," Harley trend."
"1435960","1437140"," Trending up here. "
"1437260","1437400"," Okay."
"1437520","1438520"," This green line right here."
"1439620","1441060"," Trending up saying that we're bullish. "
"1445600","1447980"," Do not like seeing price underneath, right?"
"1448280","1449000"," Don't like seeing it."
"1449200","1450860"," Not bullish whenever that happens."
"1451760","1453160"," Because it's stuff like that, right?"
"1453480","1454560"," Blast down, blast down. "
"1455700","1458060"," Big liquidation breaks, stuff like that."
"1458480","1459500"," Not a fan of it, right?"
"1460020","1462200"," Price above hourly trigger, very bullish."
"1463200","1465700"," Now, even saying that, very bullish. "
"1467260","1470540"," We come back down and check that hourly all the time, right?"
"1471100","1472020"," Stuff like that."
"1473040","1474280"," Stuff like that."
"1476860","1479860"," And you don't want to see that hourly break. "
"1480860","1483200"," Anything like that kind of nonsense right there."
"1483300","1484640"," We start to get really bearish."
"1485000","1486200"," And that closed yesterday. "
"1486780","1488300"," Being under that number."
"1490440","1493600"," That 43926 is not what you want to see."
"1493680","1494460"," You don't want to see that stuff. "
"1494980","1499640"," Bulls need to stay above hourly trigger and make their way higher and trade this."
"1501340","1501940"," 44407."
"1503420","1507860"," Another concern here is the weekly trigger to the downside. "
"1507860","1511300"," So let's bring this back a little bit."
"1513740","1517860"," In that first break right there, we got this one right here."
"1520640","1523000"," So it's still not done for bulls. "
"1523780","1525380"," So I drew this line back here."
"1526240","1528080"," I'm going to draw another line right now for you."
"1539140","1545680"," And what's nice about this is all this here, all this mess here can get taken out. "
"1546600","1550420"," But this up here, these sellers up here, they were up here."
"1554100","1557460"," And these are the big bad guys up here, the big bad wolves are up here, right?"
"1563250","1567170"," You got your next band of big bad wolves and they're right here."
"1569230","1570510"," They've come down a little bit. "
"1570830","1571950"," It's like you got this group here."
"1572830","1573870"," This group right here."
"1576470","1577510"," Way up there, right?"
"1577750","1579770"," You got this group and they're now down here. "
"1579770","1581610"," They're now sitting down here somewhere."
"1585950","1586970"," We're right in here."
"1590210","1592590"," They come down, they're sitting down here fucking around. "
"1593190","1594230"," So do I think we can get up here?"
"1594430","1594990"," Yeah, definitely."
"1595710","1596150"," 44407."
"1596930","1597850"," Definitely the target. "
"1600370","1601910"," I'm missing my trade here, hold on."
"1615990","1617050"," I'm back long again."
"1619230","1621950"," So you got these little guys here, but they're nothing. "
"1622470","1624150"," You got these guys up here, these are something."
"1624150","1625910"," These are some bigger ones to the upside."
"1626350","1630510"," So we're going to draw another thing here to take a peek at. "
"1633090","1637690"," You got some bullishness starting here in the half hour."
"1653560","1655600"," This is where the big question is right here."
"1712120","1713120"," I'll do that right. "
"1719680","1721600"," Nice little inverse side and shoulders."
"1722240","1723680"," Boom, straight back down here."
"1723680","1725140"," Tag that weekly trigger. "
"1727900","1729700"," Just be really careful in here."
"1730320","1732380"," I shouldn't say careful, but there's some."
"1735040","1736560"," So you can see it right here. "
"1737300","1738720"," Path heading high or above."

"2088310","2090620"," Big giant move in the Friday right there. "
"2090620","2090940"," Giant."
"2091520","2093239"," I don't know if we can get that by Friday."
"2096750","2101330"," I still wouldn't be surprised if there was a roll down here. "
"2102130","2104250"," And you get that meat and you get way up here."
"2105110","2109430"," All the vol rolls off that meat and that's up there so maybe I should redraw it."
"2117300","2118600"," Kind of a failure right. "
"2121120","2122420"," It's kind of right where we are."
"2123500","2124180"," Right there."
"2129170","2131750"," Maybe something more like this 10 30 in the morning. "
"2133650","2136830"," And then rip some fucking faces off right here in the clothes and Friday."
"2138070","2138970"," That'd be impressive."
"2139230","2141350"," It looks awful but it's something like that. "
"2143290","2144790"," Hopefully it disappears from the screen."
"2146250","2147150"," It's still there."
"2150210","2151730"," Something like that right there. "
"2154250","2155130"," It's got to be lower."
"2155130","2155790"," It's not higher."
"2171000","2172640"," Move these over as we go. "
"2173680","2175400"," Kind of like bulls only chance here."
"2175740","2178360"," It's kind of like all bulls have."
"2181120","2182520"," Still sitting a bunch of calls. "
"2183820","2186480"," Already did PT two so we'll move that one over there."
"2187940","2191380"," PT one PT three will bring slide that one over right here."
"2213170","2214070"," Let's look at. "

"2260700","2264020"," That giant space of consolidation down here. "
"2264020","2268160"," We only get fucked around in it."
"2268300","2270000"," This will wipe out the entire chain right here."
"2280890","2281850"," Dealers will be happy. "
"2283590","2286430"," Yeah, we went there boss but your zero dates are worthless now."
"2295800","2298620"," Have a you start breaking this at any point."
"2298620","2300000"," Be careful than the hair in here. "
"2300220","2301600"," They kind of like closing bars underneath."
"2304120","2307340"," You'll have to you'll definitely have to sell and reset to the upside."
"2317310","2318670"," Are we on this one here?"
"2321650","2323510"," Keep your eyes right here. "
"2325610","2327750"," Your eyes on this prize right here."
"2330710","2333370"," This one right here is the one you want to keep your eyes on."
"2334250","2337390"," Any kind of reversal here to the downside is not going to be pretty. "
"2356690","2359650"," Dixie breaking underneath it's 129 EMA right now."
"2360850","2362750"," Apple's just screaming higher right now."
"2366350","2368690"," Castle doing awesome right now in VDA. "

"2484230","2485890"," Fairly close to getting stopped out here. "
"2545230","2548290"," I'm fly right now and I'm wondering if I should sell and reposition."
"2647270","2649010"," I'm wondering if I should sell or not."

"2812040","2813420"," Got a little bit more still on."
"2822870","2825330"," Trading 441 49 right now. "
"2825850","2827550"," Can we get up there and tag it please?"
"2838210","2840070"," Oh yeah baby."
"2847430","2851630"," Yeah I got a new setup where I can begin to see what you guys are doing."
"2852010","2857030"," I'm still not comfortable or not familiar enough with it to make it where I'm checking. "
"2857670","2859950"," So I just want to make sure that I'm checking if you guys are."
"2884310","2885890"," Look at NASDAQ 2."

"2903380","2906220"," Let's go over to the we bolt bolt chart. "
"2907780","2910220"," Right here we got this thing right here."
"2911420","2912640"," Get this crap right here."
"2915240","2916780"," Get that crap right there. "
"2928550","2931390"," So just as we come up here."
"2932230","2934550"," The point that I'm trying to make to you is to see this volatility."
"2934550","2935750"," It's back here right. "
"2936590","2938630"," A whole bunch of volatility back here."
"2939290","2942670"," The idea here is that we squeeze up that last little bit."
"2942990","2943770"," Come back down. "
"2944250","2947850"," It's a 5 minute chart so you can see something like this."
"2948630","2951930"," And then at least begin to attack this big stuff up here."
"2952390","2953470"," To be conscious of that. "
"2953650","2955370"," Be conscious of all this crap or leave it behind."
"2956010","2958990"," Someone's going to tell you something like oh we left the gap back here."
"2959050","2960190"," We're going to come back and get it. "
"2960290","2961130"," That's all bullshit too."
"2961890","2963630"," Maybe maybe we come back here."
"2968270","2969310"," Maybe not today. "
"2969810","2980260"," A little bit"
"2980260","2982380"," of PT 3 out of day failure up here."
"2999790","3001930"," We'll bring this over here until we get there."
"3002210","3004030"," And we'll just keep sliding it left sliding it right. "
"3013470","3015430"," Still having tagged the upside here."
"3018520","3020320"," Dixie trying to recover right now."
"3020320","3024380"," If you do, I want to warn you if we do slam up here. "
"3025880","3028600"," I'm going to take the last off and be done here."
"3051680","3054460"," Get ready to get in and out of this if this happens here."
"3054640","3056020"," Big nice explosive move higher. "
"3057760","3067270"," Big green"
"3067270","3068230"," bars baby."

"3105090","3106650"," I'm going to find out here."
"3111730","3136010"," I'll drop"
"3136010","3136910"," this in for the bears."
"3177380","3207360"," I'm"
"3207360","3207360"," going to drop this one big green bar higher. "
"3216140","3217580"," Panging dong."
"3225370","3227870"," Pull out here missing something here."
"3227910","3228570"," What am I missing here?"
"3229610","3230470"," Oh, yeah. "
"3235940","3237640"," So much better money."
"3238060","3239320"," So much easier."
"3240500","3241960"," So much easier. "
"3243740","3245300"," With that nice push higher here."
"3246100","3249000"," PT three tagged over there."
"3250100","3251700"," Well, close enough, right?"
"3251900","3256160"," Even if we go up one more green bar or anything like that, it's close enough for me. "
"3258240","3259880"," Now saying that."
"3265050","3266530"," That's some point today."
"3267150","3269270"," Remember this little red box down here, right?"
"3270670","3273230"," Keep your eyes on that red box down there. "
"3276290","3279010"," I'm going to show it to you in a different light here."
"3280630","3281990"," We're going to go over a five minute chart."
"3284630","3286170"," Oh, did they going to do our two next?"
"3289290","3291090"," They're going to do our two right now. "
"3291170","3292070"," They're going to do this one area."
"3292210","3293630"," They're going to do four forty two ninety three."
"3293810","3295070"," We're not done going up here. "
"3295110","3296110"," They're going to blast this shit."
"3296430","3299210"," I'm going to go right up there and tag that right there."
"3304350","3306890"," So just just right now, right?"
"3307130","3312990"," Just if you're a bull or anything like that, just know that at some point today, this red box is"
"3312990","3313630"," going to get tagged. "
"3313990","3316270"," Just just wherever this red box winds up."
"3316730","3318450"," It's up here at some point."
"3318690","3320030"," We keep doing this kind of stuff. "
"3320410","3322150"," It's like smash up there."
"3322930","3324410"," Back down here consolidate."
"3325470","3327890"," Then the end of day failure right in here or something like that. "
"3329990","3331190"," They're going to do it right now."
"3331290","3333510"," They're going to rip our faces off here just a second."
"3335350","3336790"," We're not done going up here. "
"3337170","3338590"," So we're not done."
"3339390","3341390"," We're going to smash this right now."
"3347590","3348050"," Bullish. "
"3351860","3358440"," Remember something when I tell you guys about this, I always tell you guys something that that"
"3358440","3361080"," price will come back and check that hourly trigger."
"3361080","3362440"," I guarantee it."
"3362660","3365060"," So no matter where we go up here. "
"3366380","3368360"," No matter where we go, this daily trigger."
"3368580","3369580"," I don't care if we go here."
"3369840","3371100"," I don't care if we go here. "
"3371300","3372340"," I don't care if we go here."
"3372700","3377080"," It's coming back down to the daily or the hourly trigger regardless."
"3378560","3382520"," We get up here and trade this four forty four forty three or something like that. "
"3382760","3384300"," One day doesn't matter."
"3384440","3385200"," It's coming back down."
"3385360","3386400"," So just be aware of that. "
"3386400","3386700"," Okay."
"3388220","3391080"," And you want to see that hourly trigger hold."
"3391860","3393720"," That's the last part of that conversation. "
"3394180","3396680"," That hourly trigger pass to hold."
"3405150","3408210"," I guess there goes your PT threat strike right there."
"3409010","3412130"," Kiss it PT two PT one PT three. "
"3413350","3418130"," Next target to the upside four forty two fifty six then four forty three oh eight."
"3419390","3421350"," Do I think we can do this one right now?"
"3421570","3421710"," Sure."
"3421710","3423570"," Do I think we do the daily trigger today?"
"3424010","3424150"," Sure. "
"3424290","3425190"," These two switch."
"3427010","3432170"," You know, this becomes the where this one becomes the end of day."
"3433790","3434470"," I don't know. "
"3434530","3435030"," I'm doing that wrong."
"3435850","3436770"," You know what I'm saying, right?"
"3437330","3440690"," Tag this right now and come back down and that's end of day."
"3440870","3441150"," Sure. "
"3441550","3441830"," Possible."
"3447150","3449110"," It's it's long in the tooth at that point."
"3449150","3449890"," I'll say that. "
"3454300","3455320"," I'm flat right now."
"3455320","3455980"," I'm not any trade."
"3457580","3459140"," I like the idea of the pullback. "
"3459300","3460320"," I like taking the pullbacks."
"3460640","3461720"," Although I think we squeeze."
"3462080","3463100"," I think this happens here. "
"3463360","3464300"," I think we go like this."
"3465340","3467400"," And then we consolidate back up to do that."
"3467620","3467740"," So. "
"3469120","3470280"," Be patient here."
"3471340","3472180"," I miss the trade."
"3472400","3473040"," I miss the trade. "
"3490870","3494690"," You guys are getting access to the full suite of tools soon."
"3495010","3495890"," I keep saying that, but."
"3498190","3502070"," I keep looking at the tools where we're doing back to our. "
"3503110","3506910"," We're doing beta testing right now and I'm not happy."
"3507270","3508030"," So I'll be honest."
"3508590","3509490"," We'll be honest with you guys. "
"3510350","3512630"," You're not getting anything from me unless it's right."
"3512870","3514130"," So if it's not."
"3514910","3516350"," It has to be those three things, right?"
"3516490","3517090"," It has to be useful. "
"3518210","3519610"," It has to be very useful."
"3519770","3520310"," It has to be."
"3521810","3523910"," Enjoyable and easy to use. "
"3524050","3526730"," And if you're not hitting those three things, not doing it unless it's right."
"3526950","3527090"," So."
"3528330","3529230"," It's got to be right. "
"3529590","3532390"," Like, like planet perfection over here."
"3532810","3534370"," It doesn't seem like it sometimes, but."
"3535770","3540110"," The high expectations and those expectations don't get met. "
"3540330","3540770"," We get nothing."
"3541010","3541170"," So."
"3542250","3543430"," It's what it is. "
"3543710","3544270"," Part what it is."
"3549620","3552080"," Man, should I just buy that fucking thing and just go with it."
"3564200","3565800"," Like this is all greed right here. "
"3565920","3569060"," I'm like, I might just grab that for that one bar right there, but."
"3581070","3582970"," Now is that about to break through here."
"3587100","3587960"," I'm long here. "
"3588160","3588800"," We'll see what happens."
"3592160","3593100"," Put a little bit on."
"3596700","3599240"," If they can smash through here. "
"3610390","3611950"," Super risky here."
"3625090","3631590"," Nasdaq trying to break above resistance right now sitting right on resistance here."
"3635910","3639430"," Trying to smash through to the upside. "
"3687190","3688790"," Four forty four ten."
"3708440","3710200"," So close right now."
"3710280","3711520"," Look how close that is. "
"3712360","3713460"," So close."
"3721090","3722370"," So close."
"3722670","3723110"," Taste it. "
"3723590","3724950"," Just taste it up there."
"3731710","3734030"," Look at that big green bar right there."
"3734230","3736250"," One, two, three. "
"3738010","3739950"," It's looking for that last push."
"3741190","3742710"," Last break above."
"3745810","3747070"," Time is it right now. "
"3748170","3750430"," Got two minutes right now for a new high."
"3758750","3760110"," Two minutes right now."
"3761350","3765530"," You'll see this half hour bar close to be careful of it. "
"3767030","3772390"," So this half hour bar right here is going to close here in just a couple minutes."
"3784390","3787870"," I'm going to expect a roll after this half hour and see if it pulls back."
"3788710","3790650"," We'll look for another dip to buy in the half hour. "
"3807310","3808830"," Put up my red bar down here."
"3809950","3810730"," It's like just gone."
"3813730","3815790"," I don't know what that'll happen to it. "
"3815830","3816610"," Did I delete it by accident?"
"3817330","3817850"," Squeeze it, baby."
"3818270","3818850"," Get on up there."
"3823730","3824350"," Squeeze it. "
"3825410","3826010"," Squeeze it."
"3827070","3827870"," Squeeze it."
"3828530","3829110"," Squeeze it. "
"3829110","3829510"," Squeeze it up."
"3843930","3845150"," Let's take the money there."
"3851900","3855040"," Keep your eye on this red box down here for the next half hour. "
"3857820","3860000"," You should get a nice pull back here."
"3869570","3871990"," That's that half hour bar close right there."
"3875150","3876490"," Keep your eye down below. "
"3876790","3880010"," You'll see that one red bar, that one red tick right here."
"3881170","3885270"," If you're eye on this half hour bar, this is a new half hour bar right here."
"3885590","3886770"," Watch my cursor down below. "
"3905020","3910630"," I'm going to make this smaller so you can see it all."
"3918650","3919650"," Play right now."
"3932230","3935290"," 440.55. This is the one that I want to buy right here. "
"3936370","3938310"," This red box right here I want to buy."
"3939410","3941730"," If possible, buy that one right there."
"3946750","3948210"," It looks kind of messy, doesn't it?"
"3959760","3963460"," Dude, it's still hanging on this fucking, it's still hanging on this. "
"3964760","3966860"," It's still like, fuck you know we're going up."
"3971020","3972500"," Like, fuck your half hour."
"3972700","3974960"," We're going to start another half hour and just smash it. "
"3977960","3980640"," I'm going to hang tight right here and see if it comes down though."
"3981600","3985640"," I'd like to get a low and a half hour and try to rip it up higher."
"3986860","3987000"," Something. "
"3995040","4005020"," Be a nice buyer like right there by the time we get there like that"
"4005020","4005920"," red line up there."
"4013610","4014490"," Something like that."
"4014630","4015950"," I'd like to grab a grab if possible. "
"4018910","4021630"," Just give me that like, give me that one dip down here."
"4047580","4052360"," Ryok Ryok Ryok, Rix Ryok Rix Ryok."
"4052360","4054240"," R-Y-O-K-S-H. "
"4056060","4059140"," Ryoxie, I always want to try to think about pronouncing your name."
"4059140","4059260"," game."
"4059700","4066960"," Thanks for following brother on on a switchman appreciate it. "
"4071990","4073350"," I don't short strength."
"4074150","4076350"," Well you can or you can't hold it."
"4076450","4077070"," We'll talk about that. "
"4077350","4078170"," I can tell you one second here."
"4078250","4078750"," Who asked that question?"
"4080290","4082990"," I'm gonna give a simplified version of why I don't."
"4083270","4084470"," But hold on a second here. "
"4084510","4085770"," I'll give you one quick second."
"4085950","4087210"," You're on Twitch, right?"
"4088210","4089310"," I'm reading the chat right now."
"4089310","4089650"," Hold on. "
"4093370","4097290"," So why don't I short on the way down?"
"4098149","4100050"," I'm not anti shorting on the way down."
"4100490","4102250"," So I'm gonna give you this."
"4102430","4109310"," We don't use this system but it we use a similar system a more expanded system. "
"4110470","4113250"," So I'm gonna give you and this is a Dropbox file here."
"4121430","4123850"," This or did a back test on the system."
"4124370","4126970"," This is the system that hedge funds use. "
"4127609","4129029"," I don't know if you know this or not."
"4130050","4131890"," This is what hedge funds use every day."
"4132910","4134630"," They'll tell you they don't but that's what they use. "
"4135990","4137810"," So I'm giving you this file right here."
"4137930","4138990"," You can read this file."
"4139930","4144890"," Go through it like four or five times because it gives a base a basic understanding of how we trade"
"4144890","4145149"," here. "
"4146850","4150990"," I don't have like I had like five million dollars."
"4151390","4152050"," Three million."
"4152229","4152569"," I'll do this. "
"4152649","4152930"," Two million."
"4153430","4158990"," If I had two million dollars to own the spy with, I would trade that."
"4160090","4161470"," That exact system. "
"4161830","4168729"," So I don't want to trade that exact system because I feel like I feel like I know I have"
"4168729","4173830"," an edge with the system that I use but it uses parts of this system here."
"4174930","4177010"," Now let me."
"4177990","4181170"," So you're asking the question why am I not shorting right here, right?"
"4181350","4182770"," So see right here why I'm not shorting this. "
"4183130","4184010"," I'm going to show you."
"4184109","4185930"," This is a one minute chart right here, right?"
"4186609","4187569"," It's a one minute chart, right?"
"4189050","4195350"," So we're going to switch to a five minute chart and this is a five minute chart here, right?"
"4196370","4202030"," You wouldn't be shorting the market unless we were under this right here."
"4203950","4211090"," So you're actually long right now until we get a break below then you start to short. "
"4211970","4212870"," Does that make sense?"
"4213530","4217550"," It's like right here you would need us to break under."
"4218130","4222910"," So I'm trying to do right now is just just maximize profit being long right now."
"4223030","4225630"," So tight entries, tight exits. "
"4226470","4229970"," So if you start the morning at like 30 cents or something and you wind up at the end of"
"4229970","4237030"," the day at two dollars or dollar that whole up and down part, I'm trying to like take 30 to"
"4237030","4243770"," 40, get out, get back in at 32, take it to 46, then bring it back down to 36, jump"
"4243770","4246490"," back in again, take it to 48, right?"
"4246650","4254150"," So that whole like someone's long all day long, I'm like trying to take the 10 20 cents, 10 20"
"4254150","4259970"," cents, 10 20 cents, 30 cents, 40 cents all the way up until it's done."
"4259970","4267250"," So if you read that, if you read that BGL paper, because the BGL I think big green line, I"
"4267250","4271090"," think that's what he uses here is a five minute 27 EMA right here."
"4272090","4282010"," So right now that paper, you're just long here off this open and you don't actually exit unless"
"4282010","4286430"," there's a failure and this is where you would actually short right here. "
"4287090","4292490"," So you'd be short here, you'd buy the underlying right here, so like you buy the spy right here,"
"4292490","4299250"," you're a long spy until it's done going up, when it comes back down, you start, you begin the short"
"4299250","4300330"," spy right here."
"4301350","4308830"," Now the other, the other idea here is that you're buying the market, the thesis here is that the S "
"4308830","4312090","&P 500 goes up, it goes up."
"4312670","4319290"," So you own the market, right, and then you're only shorting when price gets below the five minute"
"4319290","4320590"," 27 EMA in here. "
"4321070","4322130"," Does that help you out at all?"
"4322410","4322910"," I hope it does."
"4325490","4330130"," So right now what am I looking for in here, right, is the question like, so what am I looking"
"4330130","4337110"," for to, why am I not shorting and why am I looking to just buy a dip?"
"4337250","4342410"," That's because we're above this 27 EMA right here, right?"
"4342690","4344270"," So we're above this 27 EMA."
"4344770","4348670"," I know we're going to come back and check it, right?"
"4348910","4350970"," Or it's going to push up and push price higher. "
"4352750","4357230"," There's some other fascinating things about this too that I talk about on the show sometimes but"
"4357230","4365710"," not always is every time we test the 27 EMA, it takes a little bit of the vigor out of"
"4365710","4367990"," the move higher, one, two, and three."
"4368570","4376630"," If we ever come back down and test, the more often we test this 27 EMA, the more likely and"
"4376630","4381390"," no new highs, the more likely we are to roll over stuff like that."
"4381570","4386730"," So right now we're bullets right now, there's no signs of us not being bullish here, none, zero. "
"4388630","4390850"," I should have actually bought that bar and I didn't."
"4394710","4400490"," I should have bought that right there because this is going to rip higher right now."
"4400610","4402170"," We're going to tag this R2 right now. "
"4402890","4406350"," Now saying that, right, we're talking about this right now, right?"
"4406610","4408890"," So saying that we're going to go tag this R2."
"4409490","4413910"," If you're a bull, you already have this previous high right here, right?"
"4414050","4418010"," 442.08. All you need to do is get above that, make a new high."
"4418170","4421910"," As long as you do that, you're on for that right there. "
"4422110","4422930"," So you see it right there."
"4423790","4424830"," We'll leave that up right here."
"4425470","4426810"," So pay attention to this. "
"4427070","4427810"," Hold on here."
"4428830","4430590"," Pay attention to this previous high."
"4431430","4431970"," Right here. "
"4432190","4432870"," Pay attention to that."
"4434550","4437290"," You're going to be looking for this here, new high."
"4439050","4442110"," Jump back down and then the move higher right there. "
"4443530","4444590"," Watch it right there."
"4444650","4445030"," Take place."
"4447690","4453950"," Now, if you get a failure of this new high right here, if you fail to get this new high,"
"4454170","4454270"," right?"
"4455870","4460010"," What you'll end up doing is because you get the failure of the new high, you'll be looking for the"
"4460010","4463950"," rollover over here and this move down. "
"4464850","4466830"," That's where the actual dip I was there."
"4470250","4472790"," So we're watching these candles right now."
"4474250","4475710"," Find out if we get the new high. "
"4476550","4483550"," And we know that on the half an hour, we know that this candle was the closing bars of the"
"4483550","4484910"," half an hour candle, right?"
"4486670","4489770"," So these are the closing bars of the half an hour candle right here."
"4496910","4501270"," We didn't get a new high right here, right?"
"4503010","4506970"," We're going to switch over to the trigger."
"4507630","4508270"," Nope. "
"4509390","4513190"," I don't know what just happened there."
"4515960","4517180"," Okay, it's kind of weird."
"4519460","4520460"," Wait a minute here. "
"4521640","4531440"," So you're going to switch over these candles, right?"
"4531660","4532600"," 30 minute candle green."
"4533820","4534760"," Here's the low."
"4537380","4538820"," That low right there. "
"4538960","4540100"," So low tick right there."
"4541380","4542600"," We're still bullish."
"4542860","4546360"," You see that low tick right there, low tick right there, low tick right here. "
"4547000","4548320"," So I think we're going to squeeze here."
"4561320","4563840"," So do the bulls, watch this closely here."
"4564680","4566400"," Watch this candle right here. "
"4567540","4569000"," We saw the low already."
"4569360","4573820"," That was at 4.41.52, right?"
"4573960","4576080"," I want to see this candle start to turn green."
"4576220","4577760"," You can see the bulls are winning right now. "
"4578340","4578920"," So right here."
"4580440","4581720"," There's the bottom of that candle."
"4582240","4583240"," There's price right now. "
"4583440","4587100"," Bulls are winning this fight currently, right?"
"4587460","4589000"," And they want to push this up higher."
"4589460","4591360"," They want to get the new high, right?"
"4591640","4592000"," So you're here."
"4592020","4594140"," We talking about that want to see that new high. "
"4594700","4597960"," That's to get the rest of that half hour extension to the upside, right?"
"4599540","4601620"," So close this out really quick."
"4601680","4602640"," They're bringing this back down."
"4602640","4605900"," So when you hear me saying things like, I want to see this, I want to see that. "
"4610260","4612580"," So this is the low right on this half hour."
"4612580","4614040"," Watch this yellow bar right here."
"4614740","4615420"," That's the low. "
"4617580","4620200"," Bulls currently winning on a one minute chart here, right?"
"4621020","4621740"," And what do they want to do?"
"4623000","4626140"," So 10, this is half hour chart right here, right?"
"4626480","4628940"," You've got a candle that's formed."
"4630560","4633640"," This is the make to make this green and red or so."
"4633780","4634380"," I would just do it white. "
"4636460","4638080"," This is the candle right here."
"4642810","4644710"," It's the half hour candle right now."
"4649360","4652020"," And you got this line right here, right?"
"4653000","4655480"," You know, right now this is being won by bulls. "
"4655480","4661660"," And you want that half hour candle to extend, right?"
"4662420","4664240"," So grow this way right here, right?"
"4667580","4674260"," You want this to get pushed up and pushed up and then come up here and win the half an"
"4674260","4674700"," hour, right?"
"4674980","4678800"," So it's 1114 right now, right?"
"4679140","4683880"," 1114 bulls have how many minutes left for this candle."
"4685580","4687620"," They got 16 minutes left, right?"
"4687920","4693400"," 16 minutes left to make this candle green, right?"
"4693500","4698200"," So you get this imaginary candle right now for the next half an hour, right?"
"4700470","4702490"," Bulls are winning this so far, right?"
"4702910","4704150"," Here we got the tag up here."
"4704930","4707670"," You want to see this candle close up here. "
"4716130","4720010"," You can do 21, 27, doesn't matter what you use."
"4720970","4722030"," Some days I use 30."
"4723250","4726550"," The stuff that I use is not an EMA. "
"4726850","4728250"," People like to say, oh, it's an EMA."
"4728370","4728610"," It's not."
"4729390","4733670"," So what you're looking for is just in that vicinity, right?"
"4734290","4743370"," So some days using weebles, some days I'll use 129, 116, I switch up the ping up on where price"
"4743370","4743950"," is reacting. "
"4744190","4745650"," So it's not a fluid thing."
"4746570","4748050"," Unlike a weeble chart, it's fluid."
"4751790","4753010"," Squeeze an eye right now. "
"4753430","4754910"," I am long if you didn't know."
"4758760","4760740"," Trying to get that half hour up."
"4761640","4763340"," Got another 14 minutes left. "
"4764520","4768540"," Get that fat green last candle up here."
"4774190","4775950"," But I switch it up."
"4776070","4776890"," Oh, let's switch it up. "
"4777030","4779270"," But on weeble, I'll switch it up."
"4779430","4786830"," So it's the closest approximation for like a free answer or for like a free option for for you"
"4786830","4787090"," guys."
"4796930","4799870"," Yeah, and this applies to every ticker out there. "
"4799990","4804450"," The tool that you guys are getting is for every ticker available."
"4807210","4808270"," Bitcoin crypto."
"4808870","4809730"," I don't care what you're trading. "
"4810050","4811030"," You don't care for trading commodities."
"4812670","4814810"," There's a few things I don't feel like it works well on."
"4815050","4820950"," Like Vicks, it doesn't do a good job on stuff like that. "
"4821070","4822150"," It doesn't do a great job on."
"4822330","4823410"," But I've got other stuff for Vicks."
"4823690","4837140"," So that's"
"4837140","4838140"," a proven winning strategy. "
"4838580","4839920"," Just that BGL on its own."
"4840520","4842800"," You can scientifically go back and prove it."
"4842940","4847740"," So it's not like this is this is an edge on the market period. "
"4848540","4850260"," It's ultimately an edge in the market."
"4858140","4864860"," Like whenever I talk to you guys about like nine out of 10 trades, eight out of 10 trades, what"
"4864860","4871680"," you're actually winning on those trades, even if you're only winning seven out of 10 trades, the"
"4871680","4874120"," money in those seven wins is insane."
"4875420","4876800"," So you read it on your own. "
"4877320","4880400"," If you're watching on YouTube, I'll post it on YouTube right now."
"4881620","4883460"," I think Tider posted on YouTube."
"4883980","4886900"," This isn't a market edge. "
"4887160","4895420"," So what keeps you green when other people are red at the end of the year."
"4900520","4901880"," I don't see it."
"4901960","4903900"," I don't see it posted on YouTube right now. "
"4904240","4905500"," I don't know why."
"4910790","4913030"," Now this works for buyers and sellers too."
"4913090","4916350"," It doesn't matter what your bear bull doesn't matter. "
"4916990","4918630"," Your buyer seller doesn't matter."
"4921330","4923110"," I don't see it posted on YouTube."
"4927110","4928410"," Somebody hit that. "
"4930330","4931430"," Hold on a second here."
"4933690","4935810"," I don't see YouTube working right now."
"4936710","4937850"," You see it on your end. "
"4938110","4938870"," I can't see it on mine."
"4940430","4941550"," Do you see it on your end?"
"4941770","4947210"," I'm having really, I'm having really wonky shit going on with Streamlabs, either like updating in"
"4947210","4950290"," the background or fixing shit or doing something."
"4951790","4953030"," You're not seeing it either. "
"4953330","4953750"," Hold on man."
"4953990","4954690"," Give me one quick second."
"4966620","4968880"," I gotta find out why that's not working. "
"4970760","4974640"," There's a link to it right now for YouTubers."
"4979890","4985690"," So let's switch over real quick and see what's happening with that half-hour candle, right?"
"4991120","4993240"," Let's just have a look at this half-hour candle."
"4993900","4996840"," You guys hear me talk about 15 minutes here, half hour here. "
"4997420","4998480"," See that candle right now?"
"4998660","5000220"," That line is growing higher, right?"
"5000420","5006260"," We've got bottom of that wick, top of that wick."
"5007380","5008800"," You see the fight right now."
"5010440","5011900"," So far bulls are winning that fight. "
"5012480","5013380"," See it right there."
"5014240","5016520"," I'm gonna look at a push that candle up higher right here."
"5025180","5026160"," Does it mean it happens?"
"5026680","5027580"," No, not every time. "
"5029340","5032140"," It doesn't, but you know what to look for to manage the trade."
"5032420","5035500"," So right here, right where we are right now."
"5039870","5041470"," Like these boxes right here. "
"5041670","5045770"," I think this box, I put it up here because I think by the time we get there, it's up"
"5045770","5045970"," here."
"5047930","5051930"," I'll bring it back down, but I think it's gonna be somewhere in this vicinity, but you're like any"
"5051930","5057150"," kind of like closing bars under this white line right here, kind of like closing red, red bars."
"5058830","5062450"," See how none of this was closing, right?"
"5063050","5067250"," I had one closing red bar right here, but no continuation. "
"5069270","5070710"," So what do I not want to see?"
"5071630","5079930"," I don't want to see like a closing red bar right here, I don't want to see a cross of"
"5079930","5082050"," the six EMA down below, right?"
"5083570","5085530"," You see the cross of the six EMA?"
"5087670","5090390"," I see that cross and red bars right here."
"5091910","5094330"," You'll be like, fuck that, I'm out, right?"
"5094730","5097570"," And then reset for down below to buy this down here."
"5098010","5105130"," But even saying that personally, for me, I don't like to buy this down here. "
"5105410","5106770"," So like, let's see this crap down here."
"5107290","5110090"," You can buy this, it's like a bouncer's then comes higher."
"5110570","5111550"," You can buy that. "
"5112730","5118750"," You can buy it for like a five-minute trade, five minutes, boom, you're long, but then you get out"
"5118750","5121690"," and you have to wait until we're back above again."
"5122410","5123790"," Do you like something like that?"
"5125690","5132550"," It's wheezing higher now, trading 4.4.2.07. Well, I'll explain this to you later too."
"5133010","5135030"," It's kind of like the no man zone in here. "
"5135370","5136590"," I don't like fucking around in here."
"5136690","5141670"," Sometimes I will, but on stream I don't because you guys all get stopped out, you panic and all"
"5141670","5142190"," that other stuff."
"5142390","5145530"," So grinding higher right now. "
"5152330","5154230"," Come on, man, make me some fucking money, dude."
"5155310","5156970"," Make me some fucking money."
"5157250","5157750"," Squeeze it. "
"5174870","5178530"," Get the seven minutes left for the half hour candle."
"5178530","5180110"," Remember that half an hour candle?"
"5181130","5183270"," Look at that big bad boy up there."
"5187110","5187990"," Oh, yeah. "
"5188550","5190310"," Look at that half hour candle right now."
"5192130","5200300"," What's up, buddy?"
"5200500","5200920"," How are you doing here?"
"5201040","5202380"," I love the you coming stuck on me."
"5202500","5202840"," You know that?"
"5203700","5204840"," I love you big go. "
"5204840","5207880"," So squeezing higher now."
"5209920","5212180"," Break on through to the other side."
"5219360","5220820"," Yeah, I went over it this morning. "
"5221240","5224740"," You can go back to the beginning of the show, give you an update as to where the expectation would"
"5224740","5228560"," be between today and Friday."
"5230280","5231320"," 442 24."
"5231980","5233220"," What the bulls need to do. "
"5258450","5260230"," Six minutes left for bulls here."
"5261990","5263770"," Six minutes till the end of the half hour."
"5268390","5269470"," Six more bars. "
"5293750","5301210"," Another thing I want you to pay attention to here as well is what some kind of funny that no"
"5301210","5301830"," one thinks about."
"5303170","5305210"," Whether we're going up or down doesn't matter."
"5305590","5306470"," And that is the. "
"5309030","5310770"," So watch these lines right here."
"5310830","5315990"," When these lines, when price is above, see prices above the white line right here."
"5317870","5320190"," When the line is going vertical, it's very bullish. "
"5320650","5321270"," Let's go in sideways."
"5321890","5323570"," It's neutral, right?"
"5324670","5325930"," Going vertical again, bullish."
"5326970","5327490"," Right?"
"5327930","5328210"," Neutral. "
"5330430","5330950"," Right?"
"5331090","5335810"," The longer we spend it, neutral, the more bullish it actually becomes unless we get a break below"
"5335810","5337890"," with price."
"5338770","5344930"," If you start to see the white line curling down, that's also a sign."
"5346590","5349150"," Maybe you start to take some of your money and run. "
"5350130","5351190"," So what are we looking at here?"
"5351310","5352390"," What is the white line saying?"
"5352650","5354270"," The white line saying we're bullish, right?"
"5354610","5355750"," Just climbing right now."
"5357070","5359790"," It's not giving you any indication of a roll here."
"5360070","5362310"," You're not seeing the white line start to roll over. "
"5362950","5364930"," Not seeing anything like that yet."
"5368370","5371990"," If you start to see anything like this, get weary of it."
"5374570","5376210"," Price below the white line. "
"5377610","5378210"," No bueno."
"5388410","5390230"," Three and a half minutes left for the bulls."
"5391610","5392510"," Three and a half minutes. "
"5394310","5396290"," See if they can catch that last green candle."
"5406510","5407890"," Let's look at it right here."
"5411610","5414850"," Let's do that nice push up, nice push up, nice push up. "
"5442690","5445990"," Okay, remember as we come into the half an hour, we tend to roll."
"5446410","5448510"," So just remember that as we come into this half an hour."
"5449810","5450890"," We've got three more minutes left. "
"5458080","5459880"," Keep a stopwatch out at home."
"5459880","5496710"," So as you get closer, we're getting"
"5496710","5497030"," close."
"5497570","5499030"," I got a sell order in right now. "
"5500270","5501630"," Giving catch 64."
"5502310","5518360"," A minute and"
"5518360","5520840"," a half left here, so you can catch these last two bars."
"5522920","5542350"," A minute,"
"5542450","5543310"," 10 seconds left. "
"5544650","5546890"," You should get these last two green bars right here."
"5548270","5549530"," I'm flat right now."
"5554380","5556260"," That tick right there got it for me. "
"5565150","5566150"," R2 on deck."
"5601500","5618840"," That last"
"5618840","5619880"," green candle up there."
"5620060","5621760"," You should get a nice big squeeze right here. "
"5623640","5628220"," Let's squeeze this like one big giant fuck you candle like right up there."
"5641900","5642660"," Come on, baby."
"5643880","5645820"," One big giant fuck you candle. "
"5647620","5673350"," Are they"
"5673350","5674130"," not going to give it here?"
"5675010","5676550"," It's kind of a small candle there."
"5678330","5680370"," It's kind of starting a new candle here."
"5680510","5680770"," That's good. "
"5682670","5683990"," It's a new one right here."
"5684830","5686330"," Maybe we'll just get the fuck you right away."
"5687230","5688590"," Let's go fuck yourself right there. "
"5698610","5701350"," We start this half hour off green."
"5707830","5708810"," I'll be impressed."
"5726870","5732330"," Yeah, I think we might get like the start of this half hour like just cranking here. "
"5736810","5743830"," I'm flat right now personally, but I'm not going to wait to see what happens if you get anything,"
"5743830","5745630"," any kind of action down here."
"5747230","5749130"," Half hour is starting out really strong."
"5775960","5778120"," It's a really strong half hour here. "
"5791630","5801510"," All I want is this fucking dude like send it down, send it down, send it down, send it down."
"5801510","5801990"," Back up again."
"5818250","5819730"," It's doing a nasty flush. "
"5821890","5824910"," Coming down to kind of use a call a lot, please."
"5827710","5829630"," Some sell your dead calls."
"5834830","5837670"," Like the number of puts on the market today is insane. "
"5839910","5841150"," I'm looking at them over here."
"5841270","5843190"," I'm looking at the, there's like puts everywhere."
"5843790","5845610"," It's like puts all over the place. "
"5847130","5851310"," They remember yesterday when they had all those calls, they bought half a million calls."
"5852570","5858210"," They got fucking shit tons of puts today, like out of control put buying."
"5873780","5875580"," Very happy account today. "

"7571680","7581500"," price stays above 232 233 02 trade is still alive to the upside now there's a"
"7581500","7589720"," not a problem but whether we go up here and come back down doesn't really matter but really matters"
"7589720","7599560"," is the what really matters here this is tesla chart by the way but"
"7599560","7608680"," really matters here for bulls is that you're staying above all this stuff here"
"7608680","7619250"," you need and you're not going to get above this here you're not"
"7619250","7623610"," going to get above this just yeah fuck yeah we're going up there who fuck yeah we're out of here"
"7623610","7632390"," that kind of stuff so the idea here is that you're gonna buy all this going up unless it fails"
"7632390","7640730"," and the trade is dead makes sense velos saying there's more up to go here as well"
"7640730","7647670"," so velo has some you have some that's a 30 minute chart right here so velos saying you're doing"
"7647670","7655430"," pretty good here but it's gonna be a grindy like erratic kind of a thing now saying all that do"
"7655430","7662810"," I think that you break above here I really don't care if you do even if you do it's gonna"
"7662810","7671590"," come back down and test here so 244 is your target you know that sellers love stepping in early"
"7671590","7678190"," and if you do as long as you stay above this yeah we go up there fuck yeah you will"
"7678190","7687940"," I'll get a little bit of roll going on here and spy I'm not watching spy right now so"
"7687940","7693260"," let me just focus on tesla real quick so thoughts on tesla here is as long as you stay above"

"7720480","7728960"," rep here failure on 250 I give that as a target saying that oh let's say they're gonna see if"
"7728960","7737020"," they can buy something so saying that right if any point we roll below this trade is dead right"
"7737020","7746200"," trade is dead dead trade and you're not going to get above this without the help of that hourly"
"7746200","7753960"," coming up you're not gonna do it's not gonna happen so valent moves higher what is this Thursday"
"7753960","7761880"," the 24th somewhere in there as long as long as you stay above here"

"8186040","8194420"," this like send us lower bloodbath it here wait for the hourly trigger to come back up at 9 30"
"8194420","8202260"," it would not shock me to see us like testing the hourly trigger by 9 30 tomorrow morning wouldn't"
"8202260","8212000"," be shocked at that I'd expect the hourly trigger to be at 440 by open tomorrow"
"8212000","8224370"," somewhere in there like 440 by open tomorrow and"
"8224370","8231010"," you'll end up seeing like I don't know you'd be on twitter or something reading all the doom and"

"8242260","8247000"," that's a good question so someone just asked and I know about this too I didn't address it today I"
"8247000","8255719"," should have actually was a bunch of shit I should be talking about but I'm not there's like I don't"
"8257410","8265910"," know so I pay attention to like um like probably in statistics with the stock market like every"
"8265910","8273889"," instance of where we are right now like 61% of the time we go down to that weekly like"
"8273889","8282389"," and we're gonna roll the fuck out of this fail and go way way down the other 40 I said"
"8282389","8290709"," 61% of time like every the other like you know like 39 to like 43% of the time"
"8290709","8300530"," we actually do go higher now we'll talk about uh and why an immediate data matters to that too"
"8300530","8306150"," because they'll be a part of that right they'll be used as the excuse for why the market's rolling"
"8306150","8312090"," over that's not the real reason why the market's rolling over I don't think NVDA whatever their ER"
"8312090","8321450"," is is the trigger for the market collapse uh they might try to assign it to that um but uh"
"8321450","8329670"," like I'll tell you what the like if the market goes higher that'll drag Nvidia along with it uh I"
"8329670","8337110"," don't think NVDA uh crashes the market I don't think that's the catalyst um for the market rolling"
"8337110","8346670"," over they always assign shit that's like you know we're at a low going into this if you need like"
"8346670","8362820"," material material something we don't know we'll"
"8362820","8371420"," look at NVDA right now and see what the expectation would be tomorrow uh you know I said one time"
"8371420","8377620"," months and months ago like nine months ago or something six months I don't know on this show I said"
"8377620","8385480"," people are like uh AI is a fad and they were saying it like in my stream people were saying"
"8385480","8390000"," AI is a fad and I was like eh I was like you're saying it like it's only a one"
"8390000","8399900"," month or three month fad you know it's it's likely not a fad I'm not in the camp"
"8399900","8407660"," of it's a fad or I should oh I'll give it I'm in the camp of it's not a fad"
"8407660","8414860"," until we really do some damage who's that guy that owns chap GPT Seth or something guy keeps what"
"8414860","8420480"," like a blue backpack on him all day long so that he can kill AI if he needs to chat"
"8420480","8428640"," GPT you guys know about that well that's real shit like um um I haven't done it in a few"
"8428640","8436800"," years but well like five years ago or something uh read a bunch not a bunch like two or three"
"8436800","8443800"," books on AI and then what if AI what what like what can AI do negatively so my assumption here"
"8443800","8448960"," is at some point some bad's gonna happen I don't know what it is but I know it's gonna be"
"8448960","8454240"," something it's gonna be something pretty fucked up probably not where he has to nuke AI but the"
"8454240","8460620"," issue really isn't us it is us the issue is the world the world at L like the world at"
"8460620","8470540"," large is scarier than us uh like Ukraine is a good example great tech comes out of"
"8470540","8478140"," Ukraine they have a history of fighting and they have a history of tech um and that's when they're"
"8478140","8483840"," part of the Soviet Union but there are other countries too Turkey um does some great stuff I ran"
"8483840","8491920"," does some great stuff uh kind of there are some countries out there that I want the India uh for"
"8491920","8498320"," even though the butter chicken republic no offense to you if you're uh Indian out there but now"
"8498320","8504660"," they can get stuff done too so it's it's like the nefariousness of it and maybe there's there's no"
"8504660","8509120"," control somewhere else even even if it is the US it doesn't I don't care if it's the US or"
"8509120","8514840"," someone else but I don't I guess that point here is I don't think that it's a I don't think"
"8514840","8523120"," that it's the same kind of a um or I'm in disagreement that it's a fad uh does that mean"
"8523120","8528220"," the price can't come down no it can come down it can come down the stock market doesn't give a"
"8528220","8535640"," fuck about well they care about fads but AI specifically if the price of AI comes down it's going"
"8535640","8544020"," to be a function of um accumulation distribution and not bad be like try to differentiate that"
"8544020","8553060"," stuff if you can out there like they like it's not bad it's um it's real and it's really going"
"8553060","8559720"," to have an impact in our future in a major way so there will likely be some negative consequences"
"8559720","8568720"," at some point um due to the pure sloppiness it's kind of like the invention of cars and there's no"
"8568720","8574620"," speed limits and people are getting run over you've got a horse and carriages on the road alongside"
"8574620","8581900"," cars you've got people with steam engines with no controls on them it's blow up and it's going to"
"8581900","8588260"," happen you're going to see stuff like that happen with that that tech the same thing with machinery"
"8588260","8596020"," right you got uh kids that worked inside of um factories once you had the industrial revolution so"
"8596020","8601580"," we're going to go through that again don't be a um don't be like a what do they call those"
"8601580","8606460"," people that are like they stick their hands in the heads in the sand and say this isn't going to"
"8606460","8611720"," happen it it really is going to happen whether you like it or not now that doesn't that doesn't"
"8611720","8618220"," involve the price accumulation distribution the stock market has nothing to do if it's a fat or not"
"8618220","8623780"," but if you think AI is like piton you're out of your fucking mind you really are like you're really"
"8623780","8630320"," out of your mind if you think that like uh piton is the same as AI or you know what"
"8630320","8637100"," any kind of junk junk ship that you're not going to see AI in a in an infomercial and sold"
"8637100","8643880"," in a k-mart or i don't think they have k-marts anymore except for other countries but i think"
"8643880","8653880"," australia still has k-marts like the idea here is that um like if you're young"
"8653880","8660460"," you'd be buying AI then holding it for 20 years regardless of what price is right now if you're"
"8660460","8666820"," like a young person right now you're being handed like like 18 20 years old being handed something"
"8666820","8672560"," that might not pay off today for you but you'll likely look back on it in 20 30 years they're"
"8672560","8678540"," like what the fuck was i thinking not investing on a few of these companies like microsoft and"
"8678540","8686420"," googles and you know stuff like that remember too that there's real AI and fake AI you have to have"
"8686420","8694180"," the computing to be doing this um but if you're young you know we're tesla one time was trading for"

"8917600","8929900"," regardless if it's good or bad uh"
"8929900","8939660"," yeah you know um you don't want AI to replace attorneys there's a human factor here that's"
"8939660","8949500"," gonna take a long time for um AI to beat it really it really is uh i have i"
"8949500","8955020"," have i have uh i have attorneys like you can get one attorney you got a bunch and uh i've"
"8955020","8959020"," had to go to court i've had um i've had tenants really like had people try to really try to"
"8959020","8966980"," fuck me like straight up fraud and would never ever ever ever ever trust an AI over a human"
"8966980","8975160"," there's like that human component to it uh that could throw an AI to throw an AI for a loop"
"8975160","8982360"," something unexpected yeah like uh like i believe in AI i think it i think it's always gonna i think"
"8982360","8987160"," it one day we'll get that like that but i think it ever gets that sensitive point like a human"
"8987160","8993000"," we're in trouble i'm on i'm on i'm with helon on this like if you actually get to that point"
"8993000","9000880"," where uh they replace all jobs like that like attorneys or something like um the thing about AI"
"9000880","9007440"," right now is they they learn new ways to mix old information that we already have they don't have a"
"9007440","9013440"," ton of access to the outside world they're trying to get it get get it that access right now that's"
"9013440","9021080"," what they're doing right now is trying to get access to humans as the link to knowledge that's not"
"9021080","9030140"," stored on the internet and experiences that humans have that's not on the internet so um it's being"
"9030140","9037500"," unleashed like that right now uh that's the scariest part of AI now if um if AI becomes singular at"
"9037500","9044500"," any point uh where it can now match uh an attorney with a with a judge sitting there a real"
"9044500","9053300"," human judge regardless if it's right um that's when things get scary that's i'm with the eelon that"
"9053300","9056340"," you have to be kind of a part of the system at that point you want to have your brain"
"9056340","9062880"," implant your head you want to have uh implants in your eyes all kinds of implants going on you're"
"9062880","9071420"," hopefully you'll be a become you become one symbiotic with uh AI when that happens you know i'm"
"9071420","9076660"," still not i'm still not on that same uh i'm still not on that i think that that once we"
"9076660","9100210"," get to that point it's a whole nother conversation that we're gonna be having so"
"9100210","9110150"," yeah so we'll talk about um we're gonna talk about about uh NVDA here for a minute move"
"9110150","9114950"," quick second here some consolidation going on spoons right now in"
"9114950","9124810"," one quick second we'll take a look at it it's looking"
"9124810","9132630"," bullish right now uh or i should say generally bullish there's some concerns here we'll talk about"
"9132630","9140110"," those give me one quick second we're gonna flash over some stuff we have i actually have a lot to"
"9140110","9144130"," talk about i'm looking at it right now and i'm like yeah we got some stuff to talk about i"
"9144130","9165640"," think tight here i got some work to do you"
"9177730","9206280"," market's in a pause right now you'll"
"9206280","9216160"," one quick second here okay no no i don't want to no i don't want to"
"9216160","9229900"," start trading no this is stupid pretty"
"9229900","9239960"," big uh so for august 25th the implied move right now is 50643 426"
"9239960","9246680"," 53 to the downside it's being priced in pretty big move here right watch my cursor right here"
"9246680","9253620"," pretty big move and then some range expansion not as much of a believer to this upside continuation"
"9253620","9260320"," i think we get a major failure uh at that 450 4th bit we're trying to get back to that"
"9260320","9266940"," previous i so i don't know if i believe this down the road but for right now august 25th 8 "
"9266940","9280390",".6 expected move excuse me a quick second here nope"
"9282590","9293670"," i'll bring this down okay you"
"9293670","9316500"," have 506 18 your"
"9316500","9324180"," upside target right there 426 48 and"
"9329010","9339820"," this is by the 25th way down here put"
"9339820","9376570"," a weakness right now in spy just heads up out there first"
"9376570","9398900"," two so the implied move for the 25th that's"
"9398900","9407340"," up and downside you know what happens in here right we typically unless we get a really bad unless"
"9407340","9414500"," we get a really bad or a really great earnings you shouldn't have any expectation that we don't hit"
"9414500","9426120"," both sides of this trade and of the 25th by"
"9426120","9433760"," squeezing right now so there's no there are i should say uh that it wouldn't shock me to see us"
"9433760","9447230"," hit both sides of that trade now saying that as long as price stays above 460"
"9447230","9454450"," i'm bullish to the sub side implied move right here do i think you should trade this into their ER"
"9454450","9463470"," not necessarily if you get a great ER and we squeeze up here right we want to sell it down"
"9463470","9471450"," right so the easier trade is to short that right there right if they have a bad ER and we"
"9471450","9479670"," blast down it's an easier trade to buy a dip down here right it's like the easy trade into the"
"9479670","9487390"," ER is to buy that dip or sell this rip above so just asking that question right what is the"
"9487390","9491930"," best trade here if you get a good ER the best trade is going to be to sell this down"
"9491930","9501330"," right into the 25th if we come down here and the ER is okay maybe take out a longer call"
"9501330","9511120"," strategy down the road i would expect that this gets parked into the close here at some"
"9511120","9520020"," point today then you're going to get a decision somewhere down here at this 464 then expect price"
"9520020","9526240"," to be here into this close now i feel like hey fuck you cap i'm well i'm super bullish here"
"9528020","9537980"," i realize this isn't working man if you like hey cap i'm super bullish here i'm going to"
"9537980","9544040"," give you what the expectation would be for the rest of today maybe you get this last little bit"
"9544040","9553020"," here come back down to the close hit it here then you get your decision right in here okay so"
"9553020","9558000"," you get this little bit left here we'll see if you can get this into the end of the day"
"9559440","9571610"," upside target right now 476 and then i pull back into the close if"
"9571610","9581820"," you wanted to do a butterfly in here that's a good trade as well into friday i"
"9581820","9587620"," have some concerns here i'm going to show you the concerns that i have where the bearish just comes"
"9587620","9597640"," from is right here i want you to see velocity it's coming dead to the downside right now see"
"9597640","9607640"," right here velocity coming to the downside maybe you get some kind of squeezing up"
"9607640","9614480"," here some panic sowing down in there boom then it gets bought so i'm saying here so i got some"
"9614480","9627070"," concerns with that we're"
"9627070","9637610"," going to look at another chart in here nvda"
"9637610","9647170"," on higher time frames has a little bit more up to go but it's getting close"
"9647170","9657170"," to a top don't like seeing this daily here but even so i don't think it's"
"9657170","9674600"," run is over so um i don't think it's run is over i'll say that so on"
"9674600","9684510"," a long-term basis on a long-term basis"
"9684510","9696130"," uh say it farther out right end of this year um bullish on nvda i"
"9696130","9702470"," would say to you if you're a bull hope and pray that you get a chance to buy this down"
"9702470","9713710"," here uh temporary weakness right now but"
"9713710","9720290"," i think ultimately i think ultimately you're trading six seven hundred dollars by end of year i"
"9720290","9728690"," think that's possible still i think it's possible i guess this is the big the big the big elephant"
"9728690","9733670"," in the room is the five hundred dollar mark right um how easy it is to get up there if"
"9733670","9739290"," there's maybe an announcement of a stock split it would be nice to if you get an announcement for a"
"9739290","9748830"," stock split that would drive that price to the moon maybe you get that in the c r hey thanks"
"9748830","9762790"," uh crespo for subscribing um so the idea here is the"
"9762790","9772710"," idea here is that uh uh i would"
"9772710","9779990"," i guess i guess it's hard to explain like i would think that i would think that if i put"
"9779990","9789050"," this effect face that thing right there we're about to squeeze man pick some money my thought here"
"9789050","9796970"," would be uh if you wanted to trade trade the year i'd say just own it right now just fucking"
"9796970","9805810"," own the actual underlying if it blasts down buy again that's what i would say does anybody out"
"9805810","9813850"," there even talking about a stock split for uh for Nvidia or no that wouldn't shock me to see like"
"9813850","9818390"," how do you get over the five hundred dollar uh hump i'll tell you how it's real easy now it's"
"9818390","9831100"," stock split and you'll you fucking run right over that like it's nothing it'll"
"9831100","9845180"," be nobody's business it'll just be like we're over 500 see you"
"9845180","9854940"," guys are saying you're super bullish today i uh have some calls here so let's see"
"9854940","9876430"," let's see if we squeeze this up one more time so"
"9876430","9884290"," yeah i'm bull it's like a like long-term bullish on Nvidia i'm not a part of the um i'm"
"9884290","9891410"," not a part of the uh fad gang have right when right when they started ai started taking off made"
"9891410","9897030"," that known uh they've been wrong for how many months now uh fucking six months nine months"
"9897030","9902650"," something crazy like that um so they're wrong again it's like a clock on the fucking wall the one"
"9902650","9912630"," they're right once every fucking 12 times or something um and"
"9912630","9919730"," they're one of the main players so every time you get a dipped buy you buy now will there be"
"9919730","9925790"," a moment where they sell it yes so you need to clarify that too that there will be the accumulation"
"9925790","9929730"," distribution of it when it gets up there but they think the only thing that keeps it going higher"
"9929730","9935230"," well above 500 500 has got to be some kind of a has to be some kind of a uh"
"9935230","9946410"," a stock split that's the fucking movie squeezing"
"9946410","9951870"," higher right now yeah it's like it's got to be something like that because you already announced"
"9951870","9955650"," the ai so what else do you announce i don't know what else do you announce maybe just like black"
"9955650","9961250"," buster sales you've got orders out the ass i don't think that's good enough i'll be honest with you"
"9962150","9966930"," if i think about like think come on be like yeah everybody's buying our fucking chips and we've got"
"9966930","9974170"," a backlog order of them for the next five years uh i don't know we're building factories everywhere"
"9974170","9980210"," moving everything i don't know what the only thing that i could think of that they could say would"
"9980210","9987390"," be something that's really out far out there uh but the stock split like you know it's weird it's"
"9987390","9993110"," like apple when they first announced that they were going to make all their money off um the first"
"9993110","10001450"," cr that apple had where they were like hey uh we we beat all our targets due to services and"
"10001450","10006130"," that's our new plan people were like that doesn't make the that doesn't make people there's no"
"10006130","10019620"," sizzle in that it took like what two ears for uh price of regudgingly go up like"
"10019620","10029440"," you need you need sizzle if you're trading close to 500 on in vidney you need"
"10029440","10036760"," like the growth in something tangible is there growth in services fuck yeah there is uh but if"
"10036760","10042780"," you're a company that bases yourself on products like apple like here's your phone you know it's"
"10042780","10050840"," kind of a conversation about the fucking car too i want to talk about the apple car at some point"
"10052580","10061260"," it's wild as fuck they have an apple car basically they're back during apple is back during owning"
"10061260","10067480"," an apple car without actually owning an apple car like they're they're they're they fucking out"
"10067480","10073320"," there shouldn't be swearing they're basically going to make themselves required but you see all"
"10073320","10077540"," that that Cadillac stuff and you guys know about the Cadillac stuff they're like nana we're not"
"10077540","10084880"," doing apple play all these other like apples so instead of apple i believe this whole highly a"
"10084880","10095680"," bit the whole bunch it's"
"10095680","10101880"," like cancer it's like you know what why are you gonna build a car we'll just we'll just like like"
"10101880","10110140"," an invasive invasive uh plant like zebra mussels or something we're just gonna attach ourselves to"
"10110140","10115280"," every car out there and then at some point they won't be able to operate without us inside of their"
"10115280","10121040"," vehicle i think that's the plan for the apple car instead of building one now uh spy squeezing"
"10121040","10130810"," right now and non-hire yeah i think i think that's apple's new plan"
"10130810","10138490"," i think apple's like why compete with other car companies and just be required in every car out"
"10138490","10144190"," there and work on a bunch of other systems in the background and then be like hey we've got uh"
"10144190","10150110"," we've got the actual fsd you want this in your vehicle and by the way we're going to own every"
"10150110","10158310"," other service in your car you're going to get like the apple care conditioning like apple"

"10222690","10228790"," don't think that's i don't think apple i don't think that it's just the infotainment i think that i"
"10228790","10236550"," think that catalact is realizing that uh that's just the in right it's like a virus like oh man"
"10236550","10240870"," we're not going to have caused any problems here it's like the perfect virus like it doesn't hurt"
"10240870","10246430"," you you're not you're not you're infected but you don't care like everything's fine man i'm"

"10259030","10265570"," uh they've got better you you're we already know we already know that car companies can't build"
"10265570","10271130"," shit right you guys know that right like everything offered by a car i mean well there's some"
"10271130","10277170"," positive to a car company like car companies uh will build things to last a long time like"
"10277170","10283390"," interiors look great you know they'll last you know 20 30 years but like electronics they've always"
"10283390","10291190"," sucked car companies suck at electronics now they suck at tech we know that it's never been any"
"10291190","10298190"," different it's always been like that if anything they'll do whatever they can not to have new tech"
"10298190","10302990"," in a vehicle right they don't want to they don't want that either we know they we've known that"
"10302990","10311030"," since the time memorial with car companies squeeze and i are now trading 442 53 what's on that"
"10311030","10320510"," upside big green bars up there up here up here baby so"
"10322980","10334910"," like it's"

"10341650","10346570"," for everywhere we already know that you need diesels for some shit need gas not like military"
"10346570","10351250"," vehicles you're not going to get everything electric right now you don't have the battery you don't"
"10351250","10357810"," have tech for it right now but shit if i was apple i'd be like they're never going to do"
"10357810","10361510"," it well we're just going to go in there and develop this on our on our own and we're going"
"10361510","10369110"," to step in for these people and be a partner i think that's fascinating well that apple could be"
"10369110","10377290"," that partner and kind of be like the only option for these car companies not to go bankrupt it's"

"12287580","12290120"," 13 under, 21 new time that is really 130."
"12293140","12295460"," So, we'll switch over to something real quick."
"12296480","12296980"," Let's show it up. "
"12298360","12304800"," I'm going to move over to a trigger screen."
"12308780","12315760"," So, right here on this trigger screen, these are half hour bars, right?"
"12318000","12321700"," So, you're coming into the final half hour here, right?"
"12322780","12325760"," You're going to need another half hour bar to get up there, right?"
"12325980","12327200"," So, it's going to pull back, right?"
"12327200","12327780"," You see that?"
"12328900","12330500"," So, just be aware of that."
"12331160","12333320"," This bar is ending right now. "
"12333500","12336040"," So, this bar is going to end right here."
"12336680","12339240"," And then what happens on your next bar, right?"

"12344160","12345160"," Any of that kind of stuff. "
"12355660","12360920"," You got eight minutes left, seven minutes to close this bar higher."
"12360920","12368760"," I will say to you that, you know, it would not shock me to see this not happen."
"12369520","12374700"," And then your next half hour bar is consolidation to this last pull to end of day. "
"12375400","12381260"," Just if you either happen now and happen later, raise a stop if you're still long in here."
"12381800","12383500"," Keep your toes, stops nice and tight."
"12385060","12387500"," Right around here, have a stop right there. "
"12389420","12392580"," If it rolls down, we can pick it up again."
"12392920","12396480"," It rolls down, it consolidates any of that kind of stuff."
"12405230","12406250"," Look at that baby. "
"12406610","12416550"," All I see here is, all"
"12416550","12420050"," I see here for me is, let me switch over this."
"12422710","12429290"," The only thing that I see here is right here."
"12431070","12432370"," I see the thrust up. "
"12434610","12438270"," I see the pullback for the hourly trigger."
"12439830","12442090"," If you're, let me get rid of this here so you can see it better."
"12442890","12443170"," Hold on here. "
"12446740","12448400"," So, get rid of all this shit."
"12448780","12449680"," Hold on just so you can see it."
"12452300","12457800"," Okay, so right here, okay, but I want you to see if you're a bull as we come up here. "
"12458300","12462600"," I want you to pay attention to this right here."
"12465160","12469900"," So as you come up here, you're going to either see a squeeze above, roll back down."
"12470460","12471540"," It'll still fail. "
"12472940","12478840"," It's either going to fail right here or coming up into it or it'll fail right here."
"12480800","12484840"," And it's going to come back down and test this hourly trigger right here, okay?"
"12485100","12490180"," I want you to, I want you to understand, make it, make it easier for you."
"12493180","12494560"," Let's go like the big boys. "
"12494800","12495440"," Let me go way up there."
"12496420","12500620"," You're still going to see a failure and you need, you're a bull."
"12501580","12510620"," You need this to come up and support continuation higher, okay?"
"12512360","12514760"," You need this, you need this hour right here. "
"12514840","12516140"," You need this on the daily."
"12517460","12519920"," So you're going to see a violent reversal at some point."
"12520100","12523200"," You're either going to see it in here or you're going to see it up here. "
"12524440","12526460"," And it's going to get really salty in here."
"12526460","12531260"," Now if you're a bear, you want to see that hourly trigger break."
"12532280","12538260"," So whatever this is right here, you want to see this break here with price. "
"12538300","12542360"," You want to see like price come up and fail."
"12542780","12543800"," Start to reverse."
"12544680","12545880"," Go on the wrong way with this. "
"12547200","12550460"," When start to fail, that's your short right there."
"12551520","12554600"," If you break this hourly trigger, okay?"
"12554600","12556400"," Otherwise, we're going to squeeze the fuck up there."
"12558080","12559620"," I want you to know that. "
"12561000","12562720"," So right here, there's your daily trigger."
"12563300","12573260"," It's at 444.28. I'm going to give you a target,"
"12573560","12579020"," 444.29. Get rid of that."
"12579440","12580120"," We'll put that right. "
"12590580","12592560"," So there's your target if you're a bull."
"12593320","12594800"," That's your target right there."
"12627960","12632100"," Now I assure you, I assure you that's where they are. "
"12632280","12636600"," I promise you, these sellers are right up in here, guaranteed."

"13409970","13414130"," They had a they asked me today if I wanted to do it like an AI thing."
"13415450","13416470"," Let me check and see. "
"13416750","13417350"," Hold on a second man."
"13418350","13420430"," Are you getting a lot of ads on YouTube right now?"
"13420770","13421470"," Say something in the chat."
"13422410","13422790"," Hold on here. "

"13443750","13444350"," Hold on. "
"13444430","13445310"," Let me look and see what it says."
"13447090","13449830"," So there's like a like ads right."
"13451130","13456270"," They have like a new like let YouTube insert mid roles for you recommended. "
"13461440","13462100"," Tons of ads."
"13462280","13462460"," Okay."
"13462520","13462900"," Hold on here. "
"13467230","13468310"," Thanks for saying something."
"13468650","13469330"," I just turned it."
"13469450","13470410"," I just turned it down to low. "
"13470610","13475630"," So if you get too many ads from this point forward, say something to me in the chat."
"13476230","13478050"," Now do you guys have ad blockers?"
"13478490","13479670"," Are you anyone with an ad blocker?"
"13479910","13481370"," Are you seeing the ads or no?"
"13481870","13482930"," You may say say something."
"13485370","13491310"," The last one you all skippable. "
"13491930","13493470"," Like every ad should be skippable."
"13493890","13494970"," So that means they're fucking with me."
"13495550","13495830"," Okay. "
"13496070","13496950"," Thanks for saying something."
"13497130","13497950"," I just turned them on to low."
"13498170","13500450"," So this should be super low at this point. "
"13501070","13507810"," Now if you don't have an ad blocker out there, I'm going to recommend two thing or one thing"
"13507810","13509310"," specific two things for you."
"13510130","13515030"," I don't know why I'm saying this but you should get yourself."
"13515390","13516750"," You block origin. "
"13517570","13518810"," You block origin."
"13519110","13520470"," Write that down at home."
"13520990","13522310"," You're an old foggy. "
"13522650","13523530"," Write down."
"13523810","13524930"," You block origin."
"13526310","13530230"," And then I want you to write down sponsor block. "
"13531870","13533490"," And get both of those."
"13534170","13535030"," They'll change your life."
"13538890","13540450"," I just turned them to low. "
"13540690","13544430"," So we'll see if they if you start getting hit with ads again, let me know because what I can"
"13544430","13544770"," do."
"13545450","13552810"," So how I did it before was how I did it before was that would insert ads manually, very sparingly"
"13552810","13554610"," at non key times."
"13554610","13558370"," Then they start offering this like AI bullshit. "
"13559490","13562110"," We're like they intelligently do it for you."
"13562190","13564670"," I don't have AI but they're making it sound like it's something more."
"13571590","13572710"," Yeah, you can skip. "
"13572910","13573130"," Okay."
"13573850","13576250"," So some of you probably don't have an ad skipper."
"13576450","13577950"," So I'm going to get you guys like write this down. "
"13578110","13580870"," Please download this to your browser at home."
"13581750","13584510"," You block origin and sponsor block."
"13584830","13588470"," It'll make your life all over the internet better. "
"13588730","13589170"," Promise."
"13590370","13603280"," Now the one thing I'll say about that is which one you block"
"13603280","13608940"," origin will sometimes block pop ups for you."
"13609300","13612780"," So if you like, Hey, why is this website not working?"
"13613120","13615520"," You can disregard that specific website. "
"13616340","13623300"," You just click on the little icon on the top right hand side of your of your toolbar up there"
"13623300","13625220"," in the top right hand side."
"13625440","13632080"," So if you download those two programs, right, they're there for like Chrome extensions."
"13633200","13637020"," And then you'll have to click on them to activate them on your toolbar. "
"13637980","13642400"," And then whenever you if you ever encounter an issue, because normally what they're doing is these"
"13642400","13649060"," sites will click a click and click a click like a click let's say click a button on a website."
"13649540","13657360"," It'll pop open a pop up window that's injecting code into your your cookies, right?"
"13659020","13672660"," So what I would say to you would be, hold on a second here, I'm"
"13672660","13673620"," buying some calls here."
"13677960","13684300"," So I'm saying whatever would say to you would be, if you ever have any like non functioning website"
"13684300","13689620"," using those two, but those are the two like change your life type of like ad blockers. "
"13690360","13697400"," The cool part about those things too is if you're watching a recorded YouTube video, it'll skip all"
"13697400","13704920"," of the in video ads, even if they if I'm like, Oh, yeah, buy buy this phone right here."
"13705080","13708360"," And it's like, I'm doing the advertising, it'll skip that shit too."
"13709120","13713300"," Automatically, like an in in video sponsor link. "
"13713400","13715500"," So they're kind of cool to use."
"13728780","13730140"," See if we can do it here."
"13730980","13732280"," We can get up here and touch it. "
"13734380","13735780"," Can we touch it?"
"13736020","13736940"," Big question, right?"
"13740600","13745060"," Just like just like a fly to a light."
"13746520","13748600"," Can we touch it and get over it?"
"13755340","13757860"," Let's look and see a second here."
"13758140","13762120"," Yeah, if you guys ever see to me, I'd say something I should have mentioned it that I put that"
"13762120","13762880"," I put it out in there. "
"13762920","13764760"," So hold on one second here."
"13765160","13775000"," Last time we were testing, just so you can see"
"13775000","13778060"," what happens."
"13780380","13790080"," On the daily trigger, last up, last up, last up, last rejected, last up rejected, last up. "
"13791640","13796860"," This is actually a good time to show you what I mean by this."
"13799720","13802000"," So if you're a bear out there, this is your time to shine."
"13804540","13809260"," So I want you to see what I say to bulls, they need the hourly trigger, right?"
"13809920","13813580"," Last down here, shoots right back up. "
"13814180","13816440"," They have the hourly right here, right?"
"13818100","13819840"," Last back up above the daily."
"13820100","13820480"," What happens?"
"13821220","13825780"," Like get all the way up there, comes right back down and what happens here?"
"13827300","13828900"," Hourly doesn't hold, does it?"
"13830340","13834580"," So when I say to a bear, as we're coming up here right now, what do I say to bears?"
"13834940","13843980"," I say, you don't short, you don't short strength, but you do look for the failure on that hourly"
"13843980","13844440"," trigger."
"13845500","13847840"," So we're going to take a look at it over here real quick. "
"13850880","13854540"," Now, you don't short it if it bounces, I will say that too."
"13854720","13859580"," So if you get the roll over here and it bounces off hourly, you're not shorting that right because"
"13859580","13860220"," it's going to go up."
"13861020","13863440"," Our early will have continuation to the upside. "
"13864500","13871880"," So just as we come in over here, where are we going right back up to this hourly right now,"
"13871920","13872120"," right?"
"13873080","13874440"," Where's that hourly trigger?"
"13875020","13876640"," Currently it's flattening back here, right?"
"13876860","13878960"," So it's giving me some concern here."
"13879720","13884120"," It's giving me concern that the hourly is not following either, right?"
"13884360","13885960"," Notice how it's not following right now?"
"13885960","13887260"," We have a big extension here."
"13888060","13895440"," So it makes me think that we come up here, hit it, and then come back down, and then we'll"
"13895440","13896480"," check right here. "
"13896760","13902660"," So wherever that check is right there, if that doesn't hold, that's a major short to the downside,"
"13902860","13903280"," right?"
"13903840","13909660"," If it does hold, you watch out, because it'll go back up and start doing this stupid shit here, and"
"13909660","13911180"," then it'll start carrying it even higher."
"13922160","13925360"," So just pay attention to this as we come up into this."
"13925800","13930820"," If we break high, it comes back down, and it doesn't hold on that hourly. "
"13932720","13938620"," So you're going to be looking for roughly 442 as a place to short the market."
"13938800","13944240"," Roughly right now, once we get there, like 442, for that break underneath."
"13944640","13946240"," And if you're a seller, we'll watch it together. "
"13946600","13949160"," So don't don't bear out there if you're a bear."
"13950900","13957840"," As we go up there, as we go up here, what we'll do is we'll watch for the roll and"
"13957840","13960340"," see if the hourly holds or not."
"13960880","13965600"," If the hourly does not hold, short the fuck out of it. "
"13965720","13968920"," So if you see, we'll do it just like this."
"13969200","13971120"," Boom, boom, boom, boom, right?"
"13971440","13971560"," Yahoo."
"13974550","13980950"," We do boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right?"
"13982250","13984050"," You want to take a snapshot of this maybe?"
"13987470","13988750"," Somewhere in there, right?"
"13994310","13996350"," Come right back down here, right?"
"13996710","13997790"," Come right back up here. "
"13998710","14005790"," If you see the bulls failing to hold, if you see them failing to hold, like, oh, these bulls don't"
"14005790","14006370"," have it in them."
"14006570","14010310"," Well, we got, we got J-POW coming, right?"
"14010670","14013950"," Short that shit, because that shit's going to go way down here."
"14014650","14018090"," See, like, like a couple, couple nice places to short up here. "
"14018290","14019670"," One right there, one right there."
"14020170","14023690"," Now, if you're asking me what I think's going to happen, I already mapped it out for you."
"14024910","14026690"," I already told you where I think we're going. "
"14027050","14028190"," I told you this morning, right?"
"14031250","14033490"," I told you that I think that we squeezed up here."
"14033830","14039490"," I told you that I think that we're weak into tomorrow's open at 9.30. Then I told you that"
"14039490","14040610"," I think we go back up again."
"14041490","14045290"," And then I told you that I think that we're weak into 9.30 on Friday, and then we're going"
"14045290","14052910"," to scream higher and tag that for 50, I think, on Friday, close, close the business. "
"14066400","14076150"," See, like, I'm mapping out for you again."
"14080190","14081870"," We're on the same chart from this morning."
"14082750","14084030"," So, here's Friday. "
"14088650","14089410"," 1600."
"14093480","14095060"," That squeeze up there."
"14096160","14099940"," Come back down into 9.30, right here. "
"14103790","14105650"," All the vol comes off."
"14106930","14107970"," He's back up here."
"14109850","14110610"," Just 100. "
"14112190","14115490"," Back down into this 9.30. Boom."
"14121380","14122060"," Right there."
"14123000","14123320"," That's it. "
"14127920","14130860"," If you're a bear out there, what do you want to see down here?"
"14130980","14131920"," What do you want to see as a bear?"
"14132740","14133200"," You guys know?"
"14134120","14135440"," You want to see that break right there."
"14135620","14137880"," This is your, like, what you want."
"14137980","14138580"," You want breaking. "
"14139700","14141900"," You want reversals anywhere."
"14142380","14143760"," J-POW, any of that stuff."
"14145080","14148700"," Okay, so just right in there, if you're a bear, you can take a snapshot of that. "
"14150020","14151920"," Otherwise, you're looking for rips."
"14152420","14155060"," Rips new high, and then rip to that right there."
"14177620","14181400"," Spy trying to get up there and test that daily trigger. "
"14183420","14184740"," Just kind of messing around here."
"14185620","14187200"," Let's see if the bulls can do it."
"14188520","14191820"," Bought a dip down here, right where we are, bought this dip right here. "
"14227960","14237480"," There's a gap above on Nasdaq at 15.550. The 15 "
"14237480","14238980",".702 that needs filled."
"14248740","14251800"," Should I say return to the scene of the crime, please?"
"14258210","14260470"," Return to the scene of the crime, please."
"14262950","14264390"," Slap r3. "
"14265150","14266430"," Just slap it."
"14281800","14283020"," It's a good question."
"14283160","14284720"," Let's talk about supportive flows. "
"14286200","14287040"," Great question."
"14288120","14293120"," You will get supportive flows above 440 today, 444."
"14295460","14296360"," It's not 450. "
"14297100","14297720"," It's 444."
"14299660","14301060"," If you hold that."
"14301900","14307220"," If you can hold 444 today, supportive flows will come into the market above it. "
"14308100","14313100"," But you need to you need the hourly trigger over the daily."
"14314420","14316340"," Let me show you what supportive flows look like."
"14316660","14317020"," Good question. "
"14317280","14317980"," Great question, by the way."
"14323520","14324300"," Supportive flows."
"14324740","14326540"," Let's talk about supportive flows here, right?"
"14328760","14330760"," Just so you can get rid of this here. "
"14330920","14332560"," You already seen enough of this."
"14335400","14337300"," Supportive flows in the marketplace."
"14338960","14350220"," You want three things, price above"
"14351020","14355870"," hourly trigger. "
"14363170","14372590"," You also want hourly trigger"
"14372590","14386730"," above daily trigger, and then you"
"14386730","14393270"," want a confirmation check."
"14395150","14396550"," What would that look like?"
"14402820","14404560"," What does that look like right here?"
"14405100","14408560"," Do we have price above hourly trigger?"
"14408880","14409120"," Yes."
"14410400","14412500"," Is the hourly trigger above the daily trigger?"
"14413260","14413280"," No. "
"14415580","14417220"," Have we had a confirmation check?"
"14417740","14417800"," No."
"14419100","14420420"," We've got this one."
"14421780","14423460"," We don't have that one. "
"14423900","14425100"," We don't have this one."
"14425880","14427440"," So what would that look like?"
"14428400","14429640"," It would look like this."
"14430540","14431140"," We break higher. "
"14436780","14437340"," Great."
"14437700","14438720"," Break higher, woohoo."
"14439320","14441600"," Failure at 448, something like that. "
"14443360","14452660"," The hourly trigger comes up, comes back down, tests it, starts to hit higher."
"14453820","14459440"," If you get that, it's going to draw this here."
"14493310","14495910"," That meets all these things right here, right?"
"14496590","14498610"," Prices above the hourly trigger, yep. "
"14499530","14501410"," Hourly triggers above the daily trigger, yep."
"14502410","14503190"," Confirmed it, yep."
"14504450","14508590"," Supportive flows will come in roughly right now, 447, 450-ish. "
"14509610","14511750"," 447, 450 will get supportive flows."
"14512810","14518210"," If these three conditions are met, you would then start selling futures and you would start just"
"14518210","14522650"," buying cash market and expect volatility to be crushed and killed."
"14525370","14526590"," So are we there yet?"
"14527050","14528310"," Are we bullish yet?"
"14528650","14529290"," Great question. "
"14529770","14530290"," Are we bullish yet?"
"14530690","14530690"," No."
"14534590","14535110"," Nope."
"14535110","14535850"," That's bullish. "
"14536370","14537390"," You want to see what that looks like?"
"14538370","14538970"," I'll show it to you."
"14540290","14543120"," Do you want to see it?"
"14549570","14551810"," Our daily trigger, price is above it."
"14552610","14557690"," Hourly above the daily trigger, price above the hourly and the daily. "
"14558050","14558470"," One, two, three."
"14559110","14559610"," See what happens?"
"14565460","14567460"," Supportive flows come back in the market."
"14570300","14572000"," Right, whoop, whoop there. "
"14572840","14576460"," Turn that around, turn the hourly around, come back down, check it."
"14576460","14577020"," What is that?"
"14577740","14579900"," Supportive flows for the marketplace, right?"
"14581240","14582060"," Not yet."
"14582560","14583520"," Not there yet. "
"14586500","14587960"," And today, bullish."
"14592420","14594260"," We got some big things up here too."
"14594440","14604340"," We got a big, like, don't get"
"14604340","14606420"," caught long at 447, 69. "
"14607600","14608560"," Don't get caught long there."
"14608640","14609560"," I promise you, don't get caught."
"14609760","14611340"," 448, don't get caught long there. "
"14614020","14615480"," Don't get caught long up here."
"14618000","14618980"," 456, 34."
"14619360","14619980"," You can trade this. "
"14621600","14623000"," Like, fuck yeah, trading that."
"14623120","14623360"," It's awesome."
"14624640","14625760"," You can even trade this. "
"14625940","14626880"," Fuck yeah, that's awesome."
"14627500","14628080"," Trade that."
"14628280","14628980"," Fuck yeah, it's awesome. "
"14629260","14634140"," But if you're just like, I'm long as fucking never selling, I would say no."
"14635840","14637500"," Very easy to roll this down."
"14637500","14639460"," Very easy to roll this down. "
"14639680","14640880"," Very easy to roll this down."
"14641020","14643880"," Like, bears are still, sellers are still in charge here."
"14645820","14653640"," Now, if you're doing a kind of confirmation here, and you get the bounce in here, sellers no longer"
"14653640","14654080"," in charge. "
"14656840","14658780"," You get above this number right here."
"14659900","14663440"," Watch the fuck out in the end of Q3."
"14665700","14667500"," A lot of work bulls have to do. "
"14667660","14669100"," They've got so much work, it's not even funny."
"14671780","14673960"," If there is a rejection, where are we going?"
"14674440","14675120"," We're going down here."
"14678610","14679410"," That's where we're going. "
"14680970","14682010"," Bull's not any time left."
"14682250","14683950"," Bull's are like, they ain't got nothing."
"14684350","14686950"," So you come up here, you fail, going down there. "
"14690750","14693650"," Bull's come up here, bounce around a little good, the goofiness."
"14695010","14698750"," They just briefly get up there, going right back down, right down there."
"14698890","14699810"," Believe it or not, right down there. "
"14700950","14703510"," They kind of nonsense, a kind of nonsense assure you."
"14704870","14707230"," Bull shit like this up here."
"14707230","14711610"," Tag all this shit up here and fail straight back down. "
"14711970","14712630"," It doesn't matter."
"14712970","14714470"," It doesn't matter how you extend it."
"14714690","14715890"," It's going right back down here. "
"14716310","14717730"," So what does that mean for bulls, right?"
"14718290","14719790"," Talking about this in the past couple weeks."
"14720390","14721690"," Bull's running out of time."
"14722410","14723590"," Bull's, where's your thesis?"
"14724290","14725410"," Bull's, what's the good news?"
"14726270","14729090"," Bull's, how do you get back up here and hold all this stuff in a Q3?"
"14729510","14732330"," You need good news and you need a new high. "
"14733350","14741010"," So you need to, bulls literally have to get above 4.59. On this run, I don't care how they"
"14741010","14741450"," get there."
"14747090","14748730"," What is that date right there?"
"14749370","14751090"," That's the 15th of September."
"14752950","14753950"," So there you go. "
"14754410","14756650"," There's the last case for bulls right there."
"14758610","14760290"," Last case for Q3."
"14761430","14767890"," You need to, if you're a bull, you need to run this all the way up into the 30th. "
"14768370","14771930"," 15th would be preferable, but you have to run this up."
"14772170","14776150"," Even if you come down one day and have a bloodbath come down as long as it recovers."
"14777550","14781730"," Now I'll tell you what, there's no joking around. "
"14781950","14783110"," I am not fucking around here."
"14783670","14788030"," Do you think that you're not going to make an all time high by end of Q3 and then be"
"14788030","14789510"," looking for like 480?"
"14792670","14796370"," You know, I mean up here, I mean like 472."
"14798110","14799130"," It's actually higher. "
"14800450","14801390"," It's actually higher."
"14801610","14804370"," It's like there you need to be by the 30th."
"14804830","14808990"," You know, a long way to go is a bull for this quarter here. "
"14809470","14811070"," Is that the 30th?"
"14811070","14812370"," I think that's the 30th over there."
"14813270","14820030"," Like you have to put this shit on until because you're going to get a big roll down in Q4"
"14820030","14823530"," and likely a big correction."
"14825170","14830590"," But that would at least give you the thesis would be intact, right?"
"14831850","14833310"," You nailed the JPM collar. "
"14833650","14835090"," You got the previous high."
"14835290","14836050"," You got the new high."
"14836310","14837850"," Let's go up and hit 480 for December. "
"14838510","14841810"," Right now bulls have to be like, yeah, maybe we're not getting that."
"14844630","14852450"," You know, right now bulls are like, bulls are like, they took a pretty, pretty big baseball bat to"
"14852450","14862230"," the thesis of hitting that JPM collar Q3, getting the all time high and possibly getting"
"14862230","14864270"," 480 into the into the new year."
"14864470","14865170"," It's still there. "
"14865390","14866070"," It's still viable."
"14867810","14869130"," It's not that you can't do it."
"14869190","14877930"," It's that it's, you know, it's like a big, it's pretty big gut shot to bulls to say, hey, we're"
"14877930","14884770"," going there and it impacts like February in it impacts April. "
"14885490","14892930"," It impacts the depth of the pullback that we get in springtime, the danger and risk to the"
"14892930","14893170"," downside."
"14893670","14897410"," It also impacts what Jerome wants."
"14897830","14899090"," Oh, you guys should think about that. "
"14899390","14901550"," Like, a lot of these markets are fake."
"14902610","14903850"," I want you to understand that."
"14904910","14911810"," I know you guys think that news means everything, but in truth, there are large players in large"
"14911810","14921510"," banks, the Fed, there's a state street and there's liquidity providers. "
"14921990","14923930"," You've got Ackman and ICANN."
"14924750","14930350"," You've got what, four, maybe six players that own most of the market."
"14932590","14935590"," And then you've got the unknowns of the market, right?"
"14935770","14938670"," You've got things that we don't know that happen, like bad stuff that happens. "
"14938970","14940190"," We have good stuff that happens too."
"14941230","14944370"," They know most of the good stuff, not all of it, but most of it they do."
"14946090","14951130"," They keep offices, man, in war-torn countries, like JPM, like he's one of the fuckers who have"
"14951130","14955070"," offices in Ukraine right now, in Russia right now. "
"14955930","14957570"," They're like, they're their own CIA."
"14958650","14959830"," I shit you not, that's real."
"14960090","14962450"," They know mostly everything that's going to happen before you know it. "
"14962950","14971870"," And then they try to craft and craft this market as best they can while bleeding it for everything"
"14971870","14972430"," that it has."
"14972990","14975950"," So it can go to the moon without them wanting it to."
"14976150","14980090"," It can crash to the depths of hell without them wanting it to. "
"14980610","14981490"," They break shit."
"14982630","14988410"," When they're trying to extract every last dollar out of the market, they can break things."
"14988790","14991530"," They're not the smartest guys in the room, but they're also not, right?"
"14991530","14994030"," Well, they really don't, there's not, they don't care. "
"14994830","14997630"," They're going to, they're going to squeeze it for everything it's worth up and down."
"14999050","15002550"," But they also don't want to trigger some things."
"15002950","15007550"," And so you likely have a fight between these different entities, right?"
"15007750","15009250"," You've got to fight between liquidity providers. "
"15009490","15010710"," You got to fight between who owns the market."
"15011090","15014970"," They buy October when they buy it, hedge funds bought it for them."
"15015130","15021570"," But so the question, the question becomes like how bad does it become in the fall?"
"15022030","15025430"," They don't want to crash the stock but I'm going to be honest with you. "
"15025550","15028110"," Like they don't want it to have that second roll over."
"15028710","15029630"," That's not their intent."
"15030590","15034050"," Like the whole fraud market, the 2008 shit, they don't want that. "
"15034550","15035390"," That's not what they want."
"15036570","15039970"," It happens though because they are fraudsters."
"15041430","15043550"," They'll abuse it until they break it. "
"15043670","15046630"," They don't care because they've made so much money in that time frame."
"15047270","15052750"," Saying that, does Jerome Powell want this market to go down to 3,600?"
"15053910","15054750"," 3,500."
"15055330","15056630"," Does he want to go to 3,800?"
"15057410","15057930"," Think about that. "
"15058290","15059410"," Even if you're a bear."
"15060070","15061850"," Think about does he want that?"
"15063070","15064830"," I don't know if he wants that."
"15065470","15067190"," I can't tell you the answer to that. "
"15068290","15072030"," But the thesis for, for bulls, right?"
"15072890","15075510"," The actual thesis for bulls, a little bit of role here again."
"15076690","15082770"," The thesis for bulls for saying, hey, where are we going next year or are we getting that, that"
"15082770","15083610"," roll over?"
"15083870","15088150"," Does Jerome want that fraud role where the entire market resets?"
"15088850","15089430"," I doubt it."
"15091730","15099530"," Maybe this has to do with like, then you're talking about like 401k's and pension plans. "
"15100770","15106770"," Like you're, that's not the mandate of these guys to have the stock market go to 1,600."
"15107270","15108130"," I know that you want it to."
"15108590","15109450"," I want it to. "
"15110210","15111270"," I don't know if you know that."
"15111350","15116650"," I would love to see like 2,600, 1,400, 1,600."
"15117270","15118390"," I would love to see it. "
"15118810","15120250"," It's a generational buying opportunity."
"15120490","15120930"," It's free gift."
"15121950","15122630"," You get rich. "
"15124010","15125010"," So do I want to see it?"
"15125170","15125210"," Yeah."
"15125410","15126510"," Do I think they want to see it?"
"15126670","15126850"," No."
"15127370","15129170"," If it goes there, do I think they plan it?"
"15129310","15130170"," Fuck no, they didn't plan it. "
"15130170","15131330"," They broke something."
"15132170","15137110"," There was some kind of institutional fraud that they didn't, they didn't know is coming."
"15137770","15142530"," They will, it will break people or break our economy as well, right?"
"15142890","15144010"," You know that that's what it'll do. "
"15144170","15144330"," So."
"15146770","15148530"," Do I think they want to do that?"
"15148870","15149250"," No."
"15150410","15153290"," I think that Jerome's probably going to be thinking about that. "
"15153930","15155830"," Like how hawkish should I be?"
"15156770","15160510"," And there's some other fascinating stuff into this too."
"15161250","15162850"," I was just talking with a buddy."
"15164110","15165450"," This could be the role right here. "
"15165510","15165890"," We have the roles."
"15166170","15166950"," This could be the role over."
"15168010","15168910"," This could be it. "
"15169250","15169890"," Might be getting it."
"15170750","15178470"," So the idea here is that there's damage being done."
"15178910","15181510"," I don't know how much you can see it or not. "
"15183010","15186970"," Or maybe you see it because you guys, some of you guys are complaining about past fucking two"
"15186970","15188430"," years, three years or five years."
"15191760","15193280"," It's some weakness right now."
"15195880","15199280"," But I was talking to a friend yesterday the day before. "
"15199500","15200040"," I remember it was yesterday."
"15200500","15204900"," I was talking to Joe and I was like, I was looking at all the housing numbers that were coming"
"15204900","15205440"," out and stuff."
"15205880","15210560"," And I'm like, you know, I talked about this in the stream before too. "
"15213560","15220820"," There's there's this thing where there are realtors out there right now."
"15221360","15223280"," Watch out for this target down below here."
"15236480","15237620"," 440-80. "
"15240700","15241460"," That's low."
"15242560","15244360"," These fucking bears want this so bad."
"15245210","15253340"," Oh, right down there. "
"15254720","15256700"," That's the clothes they want right down there."
"15257240","15259600"," They want that clothes real bad down there."
"15260700","15261860"," You can taste it. "
"15265140","15266740"," Couple targets for you in tomorrow."
"15267160","15268080"," 440-80."
"15270100","15271080"," It's that open tomorrow. "
"15272160","15279960"," Now, there's realtors out there and this is what they're doing."
"15281980","15287400"," These realtors out there are like, they're like, oh, it's a seven and a half percent."
"15287580","15288740"," It's eight percent right now. "
"15289620","15293340"," The fed's gonna pause and cut rates soon."
"15293860","15294240"," How soon?"
"15294800","15295080"," Here's the buyer."
"15295800","15296080"," How soon?"
"15297240","15300380"," Oh, dude, next six months, three months, year tops max. "
"15301980","15302760"," We'll start cutting rates."
"15302760","15304340"," Just get in now while you can."
"15306460","15308000"," It's not going to be a big deal. "
"15310380","15315480"," Now, if you're looking at the housing numbers right now, you'll also notice that there aren't a lot"
"15315480","15317920"," of homes available, not a lot of sellers."
"15319600","15328160"," So what that is telling you, what that is telling you is that there are buyers that are willing to"
"15328160","15332100"," pay the extra now to refie for lower later."
"15333380","15337540"," What it tells you, though, is that sellers are like, I don't believe that shit. "
"15338740","15339940"," I don't believe it."
"15341160","15347180"," So our seller is like, I want to sell, but I'm not selling until I get the word that rates"
"15347180","15348460"," are coming down."
"15350300","15353280"," Now, this is me included. "
"15353420","15354280"," It doesn't matter who it is."
"15354280","15359220"," So you've got these sellers that don't want to sell until they know."
"15359740","15361080"," Now, the buyer is like, I don't care. "
"15361880","15363160"," I'm in the house I want to be in."
"15363300","15371840"," Now, the seller, once they know that rates are coming down, you're going to see a mad rush to sell."
"15373220","15380360"," There'll be this spot a moment when that information becomes public and they believe it. "
"15380860","15382420"," It's like right out of Jerome's mouth."
"15383260","15384060"," Button rates."
"15385160","15392020"," You hear that shit and you're going to see people like wildfire jump and step all over themselves"
"15392020","15393620"," to sell their homes. "
"15396960","15401140"," There's a there's a there's a there's a negative thing that happens there."
"15401960","15404280"," The housing market is very fickle."
"15404280","15407500"," And when it does actually begin to come down, the pricing comes down. "
"15407860","15409360"," It's like a waterfall cascade."
"15410580","15414600"," You're going to get a mad rush of people wanting to move up into a bigger house."
"15418640","15420520"," They'll sell sell sell already up a ton. "
"15420760","15423700"," They don't care if they lose 20 grand, 100 grand, 50 grand."
"15423820","15424200"," They're not going to care."
"15425020","15427280"," What it's going to do is crater the housing market. "
"15428920","15431100"," And you're going to get more sellers than buyers."
"15431260","15435260"," And even when you get buyers there, it's not going to be fast enough to fill the need and gap."
"15435760","15438280"," And you're going to get people with homes trying to capitalize. "
"15438900","15441360"," So let's say we're topping right now, right?"
"15442400","15444660"," Say that rates are announced right here."
"15444760","15445040"," Rate cuts."
"15446140","15448220"," You're going to see it like panic sell. "
"15450000","15451840"," And they bought in way down here."
"15457970","15462670"," They bought in way down here is like 2016 17 something like that."
"15463770","15465470"," Moment you see those rates get cut. "
"15467090","15469310"," They're going to say I don't care if it comes down here."
"15470390","15472530"," We just put the house up for 500 grand."
"15472830","15473330"," They're offering 450. "
"15474050","15474650"," That's 450."
"15475150","15475430"," Fuck it."
"15475430","15475910"," I'll take it. "
"15476630","15477150"," It makes sense."
"15477390","15478810"," Then the next guy is out there like wait a minute."
"15478850","15479810"," My neighbor just took 450. "
"15480750","15482430"," Shit, I eat you guys as fast as possible."
"15482430","15483430"," I'm going to sell for 425."
"15484170","15487830"," And you just what you'll watch housing prices just end up collapsing. "
"15490870","15500840"," Now, my point here is that the damage is likely already done to the housing"
"15500840","15501320"," market."
"15502090","15505360"," The damage is already likely done even though you're haven't seen it yet."
"15506640","15510880"," It's likely going to come like wildfire whenever that happens. "
"15511160","15512660"," If they do decide to cut rates."
"15513680","15518900"," So Jerome's on this thing where hire for longer pause as long as possible."
"15519220","15519940"," All that kind of shit. "
"15520720","15527000"," If he ever does at any point cut rates in springtime, it'll it'll it'll kill the housing market."
"15527600","15530320"," And that will have a negative impact on the stock market."
"15531400","15538060"," The other thing that's going on in the background is interest rates, variable interest rates are"
"15538060","15539500"," really hitting people. "
"15541300","15542740"," You guys are paying what right?"
"15542860","15545340"," If you guys miss a payment every month, what are you paying right now?"
"15545960","15550060"," 26%, 28%, 29%."
"15550060","15553280"," And I'm assuming you guys have great credit out there, right?"
"15553560","15554400"," That they're paying that rate."
"15554900","15559100"," I can't even imagine what if you miss a payment right now what you're paying with that credit. "
"15559220","15566360"," I'm assuming some of you are having pager bills or you're paying the 40%, 46%, maybe your state has"
"15566360","15570840"," a law that says because of these are that's because of soldiers."
"15571500","15573820"," You can't charge more than 30%."
"15573820","15580080"," Those laws kind of like I think because of the payday loan bullshit with soldiers on coming off"
"15580080","15581880"," face taking stupid fucking loans. "
"15583280","15587680"," But you know, like a 30% loan, you know, that's insane pure insanity."
"15588040","15590760"," I know you guys are taking a hit right now because they go out right now."
"15590760","15592020"," I have money to go out. "
"15592080","15593240"," I spend a lot of time outside."
"15593520","15597960"," The one thing I'm noticing, yeah, I heard that shit about dicks, but that's not real."
"15598120","15598460"," That's bullshit. "
"15598720","15599300"," Dicks just sucks."
"15601240","15607620"," But I go out a lot, you know, I'm seeing the people that were spending money to build cool ass"
"15607620","15612880"," shit from the money they got from COVID and they ain't doing that anymore."
"15613520","15617220"," They're offering less service, less nice shit. "
"15618020","15620840"," The ingredients are getting kind of weird."
"15621720","15623640"," Some of the offerings are getting kind of weird."
"15624300","15626740"," I'm seeing less people out enjoying these things. "
"15627340","15630420"," Where I was seeing crowds, I'm not seeing as many crowds right now."
"15631200","15632520"," Not like I was."
"15633120","15636000"," This started shifting like two months ago. "
"15637800","15639000"," So there's damage done."
"15640180","15646060"," So if the damage is done at this point, and we haven't had we haven't had rates this eye on"
"15646060","15646940"," housing since what?"
"15647640","15648800"," 2000, right?"
"15649000","15650020"," It's me older people know this."
"15650560","15655660"," Some of younger people might not, but it's right around the 2000, 2001, 2002 somewhere in there. "
"15656660","15660120"," So you have all this bad news coming as my point."
"15661040","15669620"," You have like, you're looking, you're looking towards some pretty vicious stuff coming down the"
"15669620","15669840"," pipe."
"15671180","15673880"," That stuff is looming down the road, right?"
"15674020","15675060"," We're going to have to address it. "
"15675700","15677560"," We know the market is forward looking."
"15678340","15680560"," They're already priced that shit in usually."
"15681200","15682280"," I know it bears out there. "
"15682360","15689480"," I'll tell you that it's not priced in, but the fed is likely going to try to offset that"
"15689480","15689920"," negativity."
"15690420","15695200"," And that's the key point that I'm trying to make to you is that that Fed President is going to"
"15695200","15697340"," go into this Jackson hole."
"15697340","15701640"," And I assure you that they think about that stuff down the road. "
"15702680","15705220"," How hawkish should they continue to be?"
"15706020","15707540"," How hawkish should the tone be?"
"15708100","15714060"," Some of you guys out there are like, Oh, no, the Fed is going to get crazy on Friday and"
"15714060","15715020"," get super hawkish."
"15715740","15720120"," And then they got to look forward to a bunch of really nasty shit coming down the road."
"15720520","15722640"," And they're going to get super hawkish during that stuff. "
"15723060","15724200"," I disagree with that."
"15724920","15731300"," I think you see the more hawkish fed before bad things are happening and they're not priced in."
"15732020","15737100"," And then I think you see a more of a supportive fed as the actual shit comes down the pipe. "
"15737900","15743920"," So once that ship pipe is flowing, the fed is usually out there trying to suck you up."
"15744740","15752720"," So that whole argument about the fed being like more they might be hawkish ish in this event on"
"15752720","15752980"," Friday."
"15753500","15759460"," But I think truly from the last couple rate decisions, they're softening their tone. "
"15759920","15765660"," And I think that softening is only going to get more soft as time passes."
"15768300","15772940"," Like when you see like when you see us roll over in a crash, they're always soft down there."
"15773560","15780560"," Regardless, the message always becomes softer and softer and softer and more dumbish, right?"
"15780980","15786700"," So just as you're planning this stuff out into the springtime, as you're thinking about your thesis"
"15786700","15790180"," into that springtime, I wouldn't be pointing towards the fed as your ally. "
"15791140","15796940"," You want to be looking towards the doom and gloom shit that's in the news as your ally to change"
"15796940","15798640"," sentiment and all other stuff."
"15798800","15799280"," Do I think it's coming?"
"15799500","15800140"," Yeah, I do."
"15801060","15806760"," But the severity of it in the price of the stock market is the big question because that's the real"
"15806760","15807040"," money. "
"15807780","15809680"," Like how severe does it go down?"
"15809960","15811900"," How supportive will the fed be when it happens?"
"15812760","15821220"," Does the fed want to see it as not to crash the stock market, right?"
"15822280","15826480"," So somewhat you guys say I agree with, but some of you are like, nah, they're out of their fucking"
"15826480","15826800"," minds."
"15827380","15829680"," And then I think the bulls are out of their fucking minds."
"15829880","15831220"," My bulls are out of their fucking minds too. "
"15831360","15834220"," They're like, the moment that they cut rates, the market's going to go up."
"15834360","15835280"," I'm like, fuck, no, it's not."
"15835680","15837560"," You're going to try to front run that shit on you down. "
"15838380","15844020"," Whenever they actually expect rates to be cut, they'll be front running this shit down before that"
"15844020","15844400"," happens."
"15844820","15847840"," Because they know he's going to come out and be dovish."
"15848440","15849340"," That's who's going to do. "
"15850120","15852440"," Likely be at a bottom when that starts to happen."
"15858860","15860420"," I'm fly right now."
"15860580","15863660"," So you got nothing on me. "
"15865160","15869800"," Breaking through right now, getting a bear cross right now."
"15870280","15872240"," This is kind of the place right here."
"15872300","15873220"," I want to show you in a five minute. "
"15874180","15876120"," So we talked about this this morning."
"15876380","15879900"," Never price gets below with closing bars below."
"15881360","15883040"," Twenty seven EMA right here. "
"15885880","15887520"," Closing bars below this."
"15888840","15891280"," Start to get our bear hats back on again, right?"
"15892300","15894420"," So we're going to watch this on a one minute chart."
"15896280","15898560"," You want to watch this right here. "
"15905340","15912460"," You're going to hear people say as we come into the clothes, traitors, brace for craptopia coming"
"15912460","15914040"," from Wyoming tomorrow."
"15915860","15917360"," By the way, it's great skiing up there."
"15917440","15919440"," If you guys have never been up there skiing, it's fucking awesome. "
"15920940","15924660"," What really sucks is that you can't live there anymore."
"15924860","15925720"," You can't go there anymore."
"15925880","15926480"," It's hard to get to. "
"15927620","15928940"," It's very wealthy now."
"15929100","15932600"," It's kind of like tell your ride right now."
"15932600","15934500"," It's very much like it's worse than Aspen. "
"15934500","15935900"," Aspen's like pedestrian now."
"15940700","15946920"," Traitors brace for nine thirty a.m. It's"
"15946920","15957300"," so stupid."
"15957620","15967490"," Yeah, the Dick's Sporting Goods thing is"
"15967490","15968150"," bullshit. "
"15970190","15972270"," Dick's Sporting Goods, not a Sporting Goods story."
"15972410","15977690"," You know, I think I'm fucking posting about this during COVID."
"15977830","15979810"," I went into one of those Sporting Goods stores. "
"15980010","15980550"," I think it was Dix."
"15981990","15982950"," They was Dix."
"15983770","15991710"," And they had like fucking, they were like, I was relating it to the supply supply shortages. "
"15992210","15994910"," Like the store was full of shit, but it was nothing that you needed."
"15994910","15997110"," It was nothing to actually play sports with."
"15997430","15999090"," It was like everything but what you actually need. "
"15999830","16001270"," Like you go in there, you look for a ski."
"16001410","16004930"," I think I was in there looking for ski helmets or something or goggles."
"16005770","16008610"," They had like every fucking sized helmet that you couldn't wear. "
"16009230","16014390"," Like the one, like a bell curve, the ones that nobody, like most people don't wear, they had all"
"16014390","16014650"," those."
"16015110","16016910"," They had goggles that nobody would wear."
"16017570","16021470"," They had fucking gloves that were worthless or too expensive for the junk they were. "
"16022530","16029290"," Like Dix does not sell what they need to sell to get sales."
"16030770","16034650"," There's a lot of companies like that right now out there, but physical stores that are like that"
"16034650","16035070"," right now."
"16036250","16038130"," You can't actually get what you need. "
"16039310","16041270"," That's what my issue with Dix is."
"16043710","16047350"," What they have on offer physically is not what you're looking for."
"16047550","16048970"," Now the theft and all that kind of stuff. "
"16050350","16053290"," I don't know, I've got mixed feelings and that stuff."
"16054390","16056090"," There is a lot of theft in stores."
"16056350","16062610"," It's shockingly a lot of theft and not shockingly, but it was like one of the only things that my"
"16062610","16064030"," dad ever told me is don't steal anything. "
"16064490","16067070"," Like no matter what, if you're going to steal something, steal it because you need it."
"16068570","16070330"," Like steal some groceries or something."
"16070750","16073470"," No, you're not stealing Tide to go sell on Facebook. "
"16075030","16076950"," You're not buying food with that shit."
"16077290","16077970"," You're buying crack."
"16078830","16079190"," Sorry. "
"16080530","16084470"," If you went into a store, if I was in a jury and you went into a store and stole"
"16084470","16087050"," some food, then I wouldn't fucking convict you."
"16087070","16087790"," I'll be honest with you."
"16088610","16089490"," I'd let your ass go. "
"16089610","16092950"," You're like going to a fucking store and you walk out of there with like diapers or some shit."
"16094570","16097110"," I probably wouldn't, probably wouldn't convict you."
"16097270","16099470"," But like food, you're like in there trying to steal a loaf of bread or something?"
"16100450","16102710"," I wouldn't fucking, I'd hang that jury. "
"16103650","16106850"," You're like inside dicks or something trying to steal fucking sports jerseys."
"16108650","16109710"," Bye bye baby."
"16112450","16120130"," May I get why people steal, but I got, I got, I understand why people steal. "
"16120390","16122750"," So I get it."
"16124790","16127990"," We know we do the price breaks above right here."
"16127990","16129150"," We know that we're long again. "
"16129150","16137650"," Yeah, you remember the church tone from last year?"
"16137870","16138570"," I don't think he does."
"16138950","16142390"," I think I don't think that he repeat."
"16142690","16144690"," Like where the stock market is right now. "
"16144690","16145790"," I don't think he repeats it."
"16147250","16149970"," You might get a terse tone from the boys tomorrow."
"16150650","16154350"," Well, men and women tomorrow in the morning, but I don't think you get that terse tone. "
"16155130","16159110"," I don't think for where we are in the stock market that that's where we that's what he does."
"16159950","16161550"," I think he knows what's coming."
"16163070","16165690"," That's the whole 4,800 prediction is due to that. "
"16166410","16173590"," It's like the 4,800 is because they need to get price up there so that when that fucking roll"
"16173590","16176090"," comes, it's not as brutal."
"16177250","16179110"," You know, I got to be honest with you."
"16179230","16185970"," So if I was, if I was Jerome, I'd be like, let's try to massage this thing into springtime at"
"16185970","16194330"," like 480 winter, January 1, 480 between January 1 and February, 480. "
"16195130","16196790"," And then you drop the fucking hammer, right?"
"16197890","16201350"," So like at some point between spring and summer, you start to cut rates."
"16202650","16203770"," Housing market starts to crash."
"16204510","16205650"," You're up there at 4,800. "
"16206170","16206690"," You come down."
"16207350","16212630"," 4,800 to 3,500 is a nice cushion for the market to go down."
"16213590","16215250"," That's my thought process on this. "
"16217840","16220620"," Now, some of you out there are like, no, Jerome wants to crash it."
"16221640","16222840"," I don't believe that."
"16223320","16224860"," Do I think it can crash lower?"
"16225760","16228720"," I do, but I don't think it's intended for it to. "
"16229500","16230640"," You understand what I'm saying here?"
"16231040","16236400"," I don't think they, if you see 2,400, I don't think that's like the Fed trying to get it"
"16236400","16236840"," down there."
"16237160","16241460"," If you see 1,600, I don't think it's anything that anyone thought would happen."
"16242860","16244580"," You know, these people are maniacal. "
"16244640","16247860"," They think that the smartest fucking people in the room, not even the room."
"16248120","16251360"," These guys think they're the smartest fucking people in the world."
"16252980","16254800"," They think they can do it. "
"16255160","16258540"," So if something goes wrong, usually, they thought wrong."
"16258780","16259960"," That's usually how it happens."
"16261200","16264620"," Usually happens when they think that they've got it, they've figured it out. "
"16265240","16270200"," And the key point here is that they were trying to figure it out."
"16271560","16279620"," So if you take that, that trying to figure it out, that part of it gets brushed to the side"
"16280360","16281240"," by bears."
"16282520","16283900"," They brush it to the side. "
"16284060","16284960"," They don't even consider it."
"16285720","16287340"," You have to consider it."
"16288420","16294140"," And whenever we bounce down there, there's always an excuse, right?"
"16294320","16295940"," Just like we bounced last year. "
"16296940","16301940"," There's always a fucking excuse, because they never want to look at the fact that they're going to"
"16301940","16307720"," try to produlently, produlently continue on."
"16310840","16316580"," So if your thesis is that Jerome's going to get more hawkish as next year comes into play, I"
"16316580","16317320"," fucking doubt it."
"16318600","16319320"," They're going to try. "
"16319840","16321860"," They think the smartest people in the room, that's what they think."
"16323120","16324620"," Now, do you get the crash possible?"
"16324860","16329940"," But don't assign it to, don't be assigning it to like, Jerome Powell wants to do this."
"16331640","16335000"," Other nefarious people with money out there that want to do it, fuck yeah, there are. "
"16335560","16343040"," But you've probably got like 20 to 30 major single person players fighting each other up there."
"16343900","16345080"," And not many."
"16345300","16349380"," It's probably like 10 to 20 people, like legitimately behind a closed door. "
"16350000","16357500"," It's probably 20, it's probably 20 white old greasy-handed men that make these decisions."
"16358220","16361060"," They have their own egos that they want to brush up and off against."
"16361320","16363100"," They want to provide liquidity to each other as well. "
"16363620","16369740"," But their intent is usually the majority of those people does not to take the stock market to 1600"
"16369740","16371740"," or 2400 every five years."
"16372260","16374680"," It's not the idea to have what they do with their main businesses."
"16375360","16377120"," It's not what most people want. "
"16380100","16383480"," So it is a fluke if it happens, is the point I'm trying to make too."
"16388580","16393140"," Yeah, look, I'm not saying, I'm not saying too that it can't happen."
"16393419","16402020"," I'm just saying that it's not a fucking fraud, right?"
"16402180","16404779"," Or that comes to light something. "
"16405040","16407700"," Remember when Jenny Ellen was pulling that bullshit back then, dude?"
"16408000","16410000"," Like 2000, she was pulling bullshit."
"16410480","16412480"," In 2008, she was pulling bullshit."
"16412599","16418380"," In 2007, she made a fucking statement saying at least we saved housing, right?"
"16418759","16419800"," Do you remember that shit?"
"16420540","16422599"," So she was wrong then too, right?"
"16423160","16424140"," And they can be wrong. "
"16425200","16428960"," So I'm not like anti that messy or anti that happening."
"16429720","16433279"," Just don't be, don't be like, yeah, Jerome's going to be like this."
"16433480","16434540"," I'm like, no, fuck no. "
"16435820","16437160"," Jerome's not going to be like that."
"16438080","16444700"," They're going to try to massage, they're going to try to, you're going to try to fabricate"
"16444700","16445000"," everything."
"16446200","16447720"," You know, that's my view. "
"16447900","16448619"," I'm too old now."
"16449200","16451320"," I know this whole thing is a fucking fraud."
"16451919","16452980"," The whole thing is a fraud. "
"16454040","16454800"," All of it."
"16455460","16456500"," All of it's fake."
"16461970","16463689"," Bull's losing some steam right now. "
"16464369","16467689"," Going back down to retest 27, 5 minute EMA."
"16474849","16478910"," So yeah, coming into tomorrow, what I want to expect tomorrow."
"16483090","16484650"," Would I like to see tomorrow?"
"16484890","16492830"," I'd like to see if we close higher here, I'd like to see the message from the Fed be negative"
"16492830","16493650"," tomorrow. "
"16496700","16503840"," If we get that nice little pullback, I'd like to see Jerome come out and be neutral, just neutral,"
"16504860","16506680"," not not the tourist shit."
"16506700","16507939"," Someone commented about that."
"16508380","16511660"," I don't think you're getting that that Fed president that Fed president tomorrow. "
"16512340","16515140"," I think you're going to get a continuation of a mission accomplished."
"16515860","16522360"," And I think you're going to get a lot of talk from Jerome about the damage has been done."
"16522720","16523720"," I think you're going to hear that. "
"16523820","16528240"," I think you're going to hear Jerome say something about there's damage being done."
"16528439","16532240"," The damage has been done in the moment that we cut rates."
"16533080","16535160"," You're going to see some nastiness. "
"16536220","16541259"," So as soon as he does that, whenever that is, whenever he wants to do that, I don't think this"
"16541259","16542360"," is the appropriate time."
"16542520","16545860"," I think it's, I think it's sometime in spring summer of next year."
"16547640","16552540"," The only other that the black sheep in this argument, if there was a black sheep in this argument,"
"16553020","16562320"," it would be like a thesis of like austerity or something or some kind of like"
"16562320","16570040"," bullshit where they claim that they're going to treat it like it's the 50s, 60s and 70s where"
"16570040","16578680"," they're not going to step in on the bottoms and step in at the tops and they want less volatility"
"16578680","16579360"," in the market. "
"16579360","16583599"," So they're going to keep the rates up for the next foreseeable future of next five years, 10 years"
"16583599","16586160"," at Volker shit."
"16586419","16587400"," You do the Volker shit."
"16588439","16595480"," I don't believe that because I think that once we get into the presidential election cycle, if we"
"16595480","16599700"," get that from the Fed, if we get that like, hey, we're going to keep rates here. "

"16953420","16955760"," and less taxes. "
"16956360","16961020"," I'm assuming that if they hit all those four major topics, they stay away from all the craziness."

"17152920","17161680"," Yeah, you need to have a compensation package of 300 plus every year. "
"17162460","17165080"," So if you're not making that, you think you're not."
"17165320","17165920"," It's kind of funny."
"17166180","17174160"," You look at social economic classes, they do these studies where first you think you're in a higher"
"17174160","17176860"," economic, socioeconomic class than you actually are. "
"17178120","17182940"," And then the second thing that people do is they think everyone is poor below them."
"17183740","17185460"," And they don't realize that."
"17186140","17187800"," They don't realize that. "
"17188480","17190800"," The wealth gap is just insane."
"17192140","17196040"," Like where they actually stand in these economic classes."

"17219800","17222680"," no obligation anybody else in my life would be fucking rich."
"17223260","17223720"," Not rich."

"17226540","17227020"," I'm getting older."
"17227020","17228600"," Like I'm not, I'm not rich."
"17229340","17231720"," I'm not close to being on the street. "
"17232020","17237920"," But, you know, if I fall off a ladder tomorrow, I need to continue to make money."
"17238380","17239640"," I can't fall off a ladder tomorrow."
"17240860","17243140"," I'm one, one, one accident away. "
"17243440","17247340"," One, if I got cancer tomorrow, they're like, oh, you may or may not live."

"17251360","17252300"," Devastating my family. "
"17253120","17253860"," No doubt about it."
"17257060","17258640"," Yeah, no, 100%."
"17258640","17261820"," Like people think they're higher than they actually are and it's not really true. "
"17262280","17264260"," I wish I was single sometimes."

"17512380","17515760"," That right there would be your entry right there."
"17516220","17524540"," I'm going to move this over for you"
"17524540","17528280"," so you can see it as it plays out."
"17530060","17536320"," If you're a seller here and you haven't taken any shorts, this is the one to take right here on"
"17536320","17536760"," that bar. "
"17537700","17538580"," Stay short here."
"17539760","17543640"," If you get squeezed out here, you'd add to your position right here."
"17544520","17546280"," Be an adder of short here. "
"17547040","17550500"," It would come back down and that would give you your out."
"17551380","17553200"," Reposition yourself in case we go higher."
"17556940","17559520"," So you short here, you add to your position here. "
"17560300","17561540"," Comes back down and bounces."
"17561900","17564300"," You'll exit your position and not be upside down in the trade."
"17578550","17579790"," Yeah, I got two Lambo's. "
"17579910","17588150"," I've got a 16 year old Lambo and I got a 10 year old Lambo."
"17591150","17596350"," One of them's costing me $40 fucking $1000 right now."
"17600210","17602230"," $40,000 got to build this week. "
"17602750","17604590"," $40,000 for one of them."
"17606170","17607470"," See you not."
"17614800","17616030"," $40,000. "
"17617910","17622090"," Yeah, not joking."
"17624940","17627990"," It's called Cranbrook."
"17628670","17630490"," It's the Cranbrook model. "
"17632980","17634330"," Yeah, I'm sending it exactly."
"17637110","17638590"," They're in private school right now."
"17638650","17640050"," They're in like the cheap private school. "
"17641450","17643970"," But the older one needs to finish."
"17644610","17646030"," Needs like finishing school."
"17651100","17654040"," Oh, no, I applied for financing. "
"17655800","17657540"," I was like, I ain't fucking paying this."
"17658220","17658940"," I was like, I'm poor."
"17659380","17661320"," It's like, here's my cup, man. "
"17670440","17673560"," So I was just talking to my say, here's, you want to hear this?"
"17675260","17676320"," So listen to this."
"17676320","17677620"," So my wife, right?"
"17679040","17681180"," We still have a nice vehicle."
"17681480","17683520"," We've got a, we've got a Tesla. "
"17683720","17684380"," We've got a Cadillac."
"17685020","17686520"," And we got a Cadillac Escalade."
"17688000","17690960"," And my wife comes to me and she goes, the Cadillac needs its oil changed. "
"17692480","17694040"," And I go, all right, sweet, I'll do it."
"17695640","17698660"," She goes, you're too busy right now for that."
"17699280","17700520"," I'm just going to go and bring it down there. "
"17700640","17702660"," I'm like, ah, I'm like, if you bring it down there, it might forget."
"17703340","17704480"," I put the wrong shit in."
"17704480","17705920"," I'm like, I hear all these nightmare stories. "
"17706800","17709500"," I'm like, but also an oil change in that thing is not going to be cheap."
"17710220","17712480"," She's like, I got a coupon."
"17712700","17714820"," It says it's $15 or something like that. "
"17714920","17716520"," I was like 15 bucks or something like that, 20 bucks."
"17717280","17718380"," I was like, honey, that's not our truck."
"17719660","17723220"," I was like, I don't even think the oil costs $15. "
"17723620","17726500"," Let alone the filter and the time to do it."
"17727220","17729100"," I mean, it's probably two or $300."
"17729380","17730280"," She's like, no, it's not that. "
"17730480","17731420"," I'm like, yeah, it is."
"17733580","17734940"," She's like, no, it's not."
"17735040","17736100"," I'm like, I'm telling you, it is. "
"17736600","17738000"," That's why I change the oil on the truck."
"17738160","17741460"," Well, change the oil on the truck because I don't want them fucking it up either."
"17742340","17743780"," Like the big stuff I'll get them to do. "
"17744020","17746960"," I'm going to bring it down to the shop for anything big, but like all the regular maintenance"
"17746960","17747360"," stuff."
"17748060","17751380"," I'm like, that's like some, that's some like rich people to stuff."
"17752160","17753700"," Where you don't touch your vehicle ever. "
"17754300","17756360"," I'm like, you got to do some of the stuff yourself."
"17756640","17758000"," And if you can do it, you do it simple."
"17759720","17761220"," Like you start doing that with your car. "
"17761380","17762660"," What are you, what are you doing with everything else?"
"17762980","17766120"," Like, are you just saying the fucking everywhere else too?"
"17766580","17770260"," That's like 10% of our money just being wasted every year, guaranteed."
"17772140","17773100"," Oh, what's going on here?"
"17776040","17776840"," Ah, shit."
"17778620","17783080"," All right, um, I think we're going to get pinned here. "
"17783760","17786200"," I'm not going to guarantee it."
"17788340","17790660"," I think we're getting pinned into this close here."
"17792060","17797520"," So my expectation right now is that we trade this right here. "
"17801020","17802020"," Not guaranteed."
"17809540","17811680"," It's 244,000."
"17814540","17816460"," 443 calls out there right now. "
"17818980","17819900"," Zero dates."
"17823300","17824380"," 250,000."
"17824580","17830860"," Now they might not mind paying these because there's still a shit ton of money and puts that can"
"17830860","17831300"," pay them. "
"17832600","17834460"," There's so much money and puts right now."
"17834460","17837040"," It's like filthy, filthy options chain of puts."
"17837960","17840740"," They could easily pay these 443s and not worry about it. "
"17842120","17844400"," I need to see some evidence that we're going to go higher."
"17844700","17848160"," So this is what I'm going to do right on 443."
"17850040","17853720"," I'm going to give, I'm going to make this big fat yellow line here. "
"17854100","17859780"," I want to see, I want to see like the hold above this."
"17861360","17863180"," Like this right here is going to be important."
"17865580","17868140"," Do they leave these in the money into the bell?"
"17868320","17873860"," Sometimes they do and they have reason to as well today just because of the just the share amount"
"17873860","17874900"," of put buyers out there. "
"17875360","17878700"," They have the money to spend on those calls and make them close the money."
"17879080","17880380"," But I would need to see proof."
"17880820","17881880"," It looks like a pin. "
"17883820","17889840"," Get the power coming up here for the next hour or maybe they squeeze it up."
"17891960","17892800"," Tag the 443."
"17894100","17898180"," Put the 443s in the money and then it comes right back down again into this close. "
"17898980","17901440"," I'd be open to this trade here for the next hour as well."
"17903160","17905520"," You put them in the money up here at that Valhalla."
"17905940","17913460"," That's that 443.99. So I'd give that as a potential like plan B."
"17916540","17920480"," Put those calls in the money, sell it right back down to the close and below 443. "
"17928520","17930260"," Put it right back down right there."
"17930600","17933760"," If you're bullish, I think that's your best bet."
"17936620","17939020"," Something like that, maybe. "
"17950360","17952060"," Yeah, that's what I was doing with the oil."
"17952340","17953180"," I'm like, I'll change the oil."
"17953420","17954980"," I'm like, you're not sending it down to the shop. "
"17955940","17956960"," I'm like, you're not doing that."
"17958000","17960080"," It's like, it has to do with other stuff."
"17961300","17965400"," It has more to do with, it doesn't really have to do with changing the oil. "
"17966060","17968820"," It has to do with like, I don't know about you."
"17969380","17971420"," In my family, like, I'll find shit."
"17971600","17973240"," I'm like, what, I'm like, what, I'm like, wait a minute. "
"17973480","17974300"," Like, they tell you no."
"17974860","17975540"," Like, they told us no."
"17976820","17977980"," Like, so how much did you pay for that?"
"17978140","17980100"," It's like, oh, it just costs next 500 bucks for the promise. "
"17980380","17981240"," Like, no, no, no, no, no, you didn't."
"17981460","17982740"," They have to say the right things to them."
"17982940","17984480"," Like, do we negotiate with them?"
"17985040","17987900"," It's like, it's always like that little gray area in your finances. "
"17989660","17991820"," And you got to be frugal with that stuff."
"17991960","17992900"," You're not frugal with that stuff."
"17993000","17994640"," It just creeps into every part of your life. "
"18002100","18003300"," Yes, my kids, man."
"18003460","18005260"," My kids are freaking Lamborghinis, dude."
"18005440","18007180"," They're stupid expensive. "
"18007520","18011460"," If you don't have kids, do you have any idea how expensive kids are right now?"
"18012140","18013000"," It's like ridiculous."
"18013400","18014720"," It is out of fucking control."
"18014720","18019000"," I have spent, I got to be at a million dollars for a kid right now. "
"18019380","18019620"," Easy."
"18020460","18020860"," Easy."
"18021540","18023720"," The kids are stupid expensive. "
"18024480","18030200"," If you took in like the indirect costs of raising kids, it's got to be a million dollars right now."
"18030440","18030840"," Got to be."
"18032360","18036280"," Got to be like between like houses you have to own, the cars you have to drive, the fucking stupid"
"18036280","18036980"," shit they got to wear. "
"18037500","18038900"," They grow up fucking ski tickets."
"18039720","18041260"," Like all the stupid shit that they do."
"18041740","18042160"," Braces?"
"18042700","18044820"," Like, dude, it's never fucking ending. "
"18045480","18046460"," It never fucking ends."
"18049340","18050580"," It never ends."
"18051900","18052880"," Yeah, it's insane. "
"18053340","18057020"," And dude, my oldest just asked that I keep a house for her."
"18057580","18059480"," She doesn't believe she'll be able to buy a house."
"18060440","18064860"," As a true conversation we had, it's been going on for some time now, but the seriousness of it has"
"18064860","18065640"," gotten more serious. "
"18066680","18069420"," My oldest daughter is like, you have to keep a house for me."
"18069520","18070660"," I don't know if I'll do a buy a house."
"18072400","18073380"," And I'm like, huh?"
"18076040","18081160"," Like, just imagine like you have to, you have to like, you like, as when I was a kid, right?"
"18081560","18088260"," There's never a discussion amongst my parents to like, put money away to help them be able to buy a"
"18088260","18088640"," house. "
"18089380","18089860"," Never."
"18090400","18092120"," That was never like on my fucking rip."
"18092440","18096540"," On my radar was like, please don't kick me out at 18. "
"18098400","18102180"," If you can at least help me get through college or find a way to pay for it."
"18104960","18110120"," And when I get out of college, when I get out of the army in college, I might need a"
"18110120","18111400"," place to stay for a few weeks."
"18112700","18113520"," Like that was it. "
"18114020","18116300"," That was like the highest expectation."
"18118940","18123620"," We got my kid right now asking me like, I don't know what's going to be out there for me."
"18123820","18125480"," I'm like, that's legitimate. "
"18126540","18127960"," I trust what she has to say."
"18128280","18129040"," I believe my kids."
"18129340","18131600"," I remember when I was a kid and my parents didn't believe me. "
"18132360","18134660"," You know what my fears were and all that kind of stuff."
"18137080","18139000"," Oh yeah, the eating is out of control too."
"18139320","18146540"," Like, dude, my kids, my youngest is the biggest offender right now at the food. "
"18147480","18148860"," Like, she's just like a machine."
"18150280","18152300"," It's like a full growth mode right now."
"18152300","18156080"," But like, the eating is out of control. "
"18160880","18169940"," Dude, like garbage trucks, dude, like, my, my, um, my wife, of course, will be like,"
"18170340","18172200"," they already had dinner."
"18173560","18177820"," I'm like, it's like 10 o'clock at night and I'm finally eating dinner, like nine o'clock, 10 o "
"18177820","18178420","'clock, I mean dinner."
"18178620","18181660"," I'm like, I'm like, uh, day's going to make some kachui pepade. "
"18181660","18182460"," Does anybody want me?"
"18182800","18184200"," Fucking hands go up around the house."
"18184380","18184780"," I'll eat that."
"18189040","18191340"," All of it, they, and they eat frequently. "
"18192140","18193020"," It's like they'll eat free."
"18193280","18194220"," They like hobbits."
"18196600","18203660"," They go like supper, dinner, dinner Z, supper Z, late night supper Z."
"18204480","18206540"," Then the youngest is like, what do we got for dessert?"
"18206880","18209020"," I'm like, we got strawberry, shortcake, brownies, cookies. "
"18210160","18212300"," I got some special expensive chocolate from Germany."
"18212300","18213400"," I'll take that, daddy."
"18214060","18215880"," You want the special expensive chocolate from Germany?"
"18217980","18218700"," Yes, daddy. "
"18219080","18221700"," As a matter of fact, I baked cookies the other night."
"18222660","18223440"," Is that working late?"
"18223640","18225840"," And I'm like, I'm going to bake myself some cookies."
"18227520","18230820"," I think I made three or four cookies or something, baked four cookies. "
"18232480","18233900"," I put them on a plate."
"18234880","18236900"," I think I got through one, one and a half of them."
"18237360","18238720"," That was it, like one and a half. "
"18238840","18239280"," They're kind of big."
"18239400","18239900"," They're like, it's big."
"18242300","18245380"," And I ate them and then I left them on the table. "
"18245580","18248320"," I came back in the morning and I was like, I should have forgot the cookies in the table."
"18248760","18249440"," They were gone."
"18250180","18252060"," It's like seven in the morning gone. "
"18253180","18255140"," I'm like, who woke up and ate those cookies in the middle of the night?"
"18255720","18256360"," You know who it was?"
"18257380","18257860"," It was the youngest."
"18259040","18263660"," Probably woke up like four or five in the morning, walked right out into the kitchen to get some"
"18263660","18265720"," water or something, saw those cookies on the counter."
"18266760","18267580"," I was like, I'm eating those. "
"18272660","18273860"," Yeah, I got to give them premium."
"18278380","18280040"," Not any plays right now."
"18280280","18281200"," I got nothing on the table. "
"18283880","18287020"," If they can get above this fourth 43, I'd take a trade."
"18289520","18293480"," There's 250,000 calls that were just put on the market."
"18294340","18296780"," So the dealers are not going to want to pay them. "
"18297740","18300100"," We know that that number is right here."
"18301020","18302500"," This would be in the money right here."
"18305640","18307120"," Do they want to pay those calls?"
"18307480","18308780"," Fuck no, they don't want to pay those calls. "
"18310160","18313780"," There's a possibility they could send it up and then bring it back down to the close."
"18314080","18314560"," Yeah, possible."
"18316400","18317580"," What do I think happens?"
"18318320","18319020"," I think we do this. "
"18329570","18333350"," And I think we see, where is that bad boy down there?"
"18336810","18338170"," I think we see this."
"18342610","18351010"," I think we see this into the open tomorrow at 9.30. Blood and then this right here, recovery."
"18353710","18356410"," Now, if in that interviewing, they get really nasty. "
"18360560","18366680"," If that 9.30 morning bullshit, that 9.30 is nasty."
"18368020","18368840"," Not willing to buy this."
"18369140","18373880"," And furthermore, to that point, let's talk about tomorrow really quick. "
"18374580","18378180"," Go over to trigger screen."
"18379160","18388720"," So just into tomorrow, if you are a bull looking for a dip buy, you are looking for this to"
"18388720","18389780"," be defended right here."
"18390900","18394500"," So it's after three o'clock. "
"18394680","18396400"," Let's talk about tomorrow."
"18397220","18399080"," So let's review yesterday too."
"18399400","18400020"," Yeah, yesterday is closed. "
"18400820","18406340"," So yesterday into the close, we were below the hourly trigger and the half hour trigger right here."
"18407340","18407740"," Right?"
"18408380","18412720"," Talked about this in the close yesterday."
"18413300","18415000"," We actually gave a target here. "
"18415160","18416420"," Gave you an exact number."
"18419840","18424960"," Now, $4.39.26. It's like I ain't buying shit must run up here above here."
"18425540","18428260"," I said, there's not a lot of time left for bulls to save themselves. "
"18429200","18431540"," And what was the bar right before they opened this morning?"
"18431660","18432100"," Does anybody know?"
"18433320","18435800"," It's $4.39.26 right before they opened."
"18436560","18438520"," $4.39.26. We ripped higher."
"18439700","18441560"," This number right here was the key, right?"
"18442240","18444680"," We got above it this morning, start ripping faces off. "
"18446340","18455940"," So going back to the trigger screen here, if you are a bull, here are your options, okay?"
"18457900","18467720"," If price can get above the 27 EMA, you can take this trade up right"
"18467720","18468040"," here."
"18470360","18471920"," $4.44.50 ish."
"18473040","18474940"," You might get a little push higher here. "
"18476180","18477360"," That's trade for you."
"18480220","18484120"," Next thing, if you're looking for a dip to buy tomorrow, it's down here."
"18484560","18487320"," $4.40.50, okay?"
"18487600","18489900"," On tomorrow's open, that's what you're going to be wanting to buy. "
"18490200","18494920"," If at any point we break below tomorrow, you've got no trade to buy down here, okay?"
"18495660","18497260"," So if you're a bull, that's what you're looking for."
"18498460","18505160"," If we squeeze above, it is not tenable until the hourly comes up and supports."
"18506320","18509980"," So any kind of squeezing above here, I don't expect it to hold. "
"18510680","18517000"," I want to see price come back down and confirm on this hourly trigger."
"18517260","18519340"," So if you're a bull, you have to be tactful here."
"18521020","18523300"," What are my expectations into tomorrow?"
"18523300","18527680"," So we're going to go back to the Weebull chart right here. "
"18532610","18534470"," Get a little bit of squeezing going on right now."
"18536290","18540950"," You've got 260,000 calls right now."
"18541670","18545390"," So if you're looking for a trade as a bull, you might have this Valhalla trade in the close. "
"18545870","18548270"," I would not attempt to hold on to it."
"18548410","18550630"," I'll get rid of it before the ending close today."
"18551490","18556930"," Even if it's between 4.15 and 6 p.m. they could still, even if it takes the 4.15"
"18556930","18561890"," or 6 p.m. We're still not going to want to close all these calls in the money. "
"18562670","18564250"," And you guys have traded spreads to know this."
"18565390","18569630"," The finagling or the wink wink stuff happens between 4.15 and 6."
"18570510","18577790"," So even if we go up here into this close, they could run it right back down into 6 o "
"18577790","18582410","'clock and not pay those calls out after 6."
"18596240","18598000"," So I'm trying to get down this trade right now."
"18601610","18603730"," I'm on this trade to the upside again right now. "
"18604030","18604710"," I'm long again."
"18606530","18607950"," So just be aware of that."
"18608570","18616850"," Be aware of that, even if NVDA has a great earnings that you could see the market squeeze higher. "
"18617510","18618590"," You could see it squeeze higher."
"18618830","18625650"," Come back down, squeeze up here and still come back down by 6.15. So they're not closing those"
"18625650","18626330"," calls in the money."
"18626330","18628030"," So just be aware of all this stuff here. "
"18633320","18635000"," Expectation on tomorrow's open."
"18637520","18639620"," Even with any kind of squeezing in here."
"18639920","18642560"," Even with a good spec earnings. "
"18643700","18644740"," It's still going to be down."
"18646020","18647460"," Let me see if I can count the hours here."
"18650160","18653720"," Target open tomorrow, 4.42 to the downside. "
"18654780","18658760"," So if you want a downside target for tomorrow, 4.42. I'm going to leave this right here."
"18663950","18665470"," Slide that over so you can see it."
"18667790","18677490"," Downside target, 4.42. Into Friday, upside target, 4.48. I said 4.50 earlier, but"
"18677490","18681250"," 4.48 for an upside target into Friday. "
"18682090","18686930"," If you get the 4.50 or a breach above, you get like 4.50 or 4.52 or something"
"18686930","18687290"," like that."
"18687730","18689130"," That's all free money for you."
"18689130","18696090"," But like the conservative, what to expect in a Friday, 4.48 is the upside target. "
"18700120","18703960"," So this morning on the opening bell, I closed puts and went along the market."
"18704320","18706140"," Right on the opening bell, I closed this morning."
"18707080","18709640"," If you're here on the stream, you knew that first thing this morning. "
"18716760","18718600"," I was stationed in South Korea."
"18719280","18720380"," They do that shit all the time."
"18725700","18731400"," So I'm going to give you guys an update here so that you guys are crystal clear here, crystal clear"
"18731400","18734560"," so you're not spreading stuff that you don't know what you're talking about here. "
"18734960","18736920"," Or maybe you're trying to cloud tomorrow."
"18737140","18739860"," I'm going to show it to you right now the last time."
"18740440","18743500"," So one more time for you for the cheap seats here. "
"18745220","18752600"," Fed officials, interviews from Jackson Hole Summit right there."
"18753420","18756480"," 10 a.m. Don't miss it tomorrow."
"18758080","18765500"," Then you have Fed Powell speaking at 10.05 opening speech on Friday. "
"18765880","18773060"," So I want you to know that you have vault tomorrow at 10 a.m. And the Fed officials speaking,"
"18773460","18777360"," the Fed presidents right in here, and you've got your room down here."
"18779300","18783880"," You also have claims tomorrow, durable goods, durable goods, minus transportation."
"18785120","18789340"," Then you've got University of Michigan consumer sentiment tomorrow. "
"18790180","18791100"," Thanks for saying something."
"18800910","18805210"," Guy closing around the opening bell this morning, right on the opening bell and by calls."
"18805630","18809730"," He even put on Twitter this morning, or trigger, bull cluster. "
"18810170","18812650"," As soon as that came out, bye bye."
"18819830","18821010"," A future is trading."
"18821150","18822910"," We're going to do that coming up in the next week or two. "
"18823030","18827470"," We're going to do a whole futures series like three, four days, something like that."
"18831700","18832700"," Eastern Standard Time."
"18833200","18837740"," So I'm going to expect it at 9.30. There's these guys here. "
"18838080","18838920"," I said it earlier."
"18839300","18841980"," These guys are going to, like you're going to have two groups of people."
"18842240","18844460"," You're going to have like the bad guy and the good guy, right?"
"18845100","18847840"," Or you're going to get the bad guy and the bad guy, or you're going to get the good guy"
"18847840","18848420"," and the good guy. "
"18848420","18855440"," So when we come into that, they're going to set a tone tomorrow morning until into Friday."
"18855720","18857700"," So be aware of that tomorrow."
"18857820","18867450"," 10 AM, 10.05 to be exact, 10.05. No, so"
"18867450","18869750"," XLF was at a just a heads up. "
"18869790","18870690"," So good question."
"18870850","18873330"," So Chase is asking about XLF."
"18873450","18874550"," We're going to talk about XLF right now. "
"18874550","18874950"," You want to do that?"
"18875510","18876090"," We can talk about it."
"18878490","18880530"," XLF was not ignoring the downgrades."
"18880530","18882050"," XLF was on a cliff. "
"18883570","18886930"," Going back to the top of my head, I think March 8th."
"18887510","18888710"," February 8th or March 8th."
"18889350","18892290"," People back and look at XLF on March 8th or February 8th. "
"18892770","18893690"," I do my work at nighttime."
"18893990","18894910"," I just don't always talk about it."
"18896190","18899010"," So XLF, as of last night, was on a cliff. "
"18900590","18908350"," Just send the S&P 500 down to its weekly target, right?"
"18908530","18909850"," That weekly trigger."
"18910530","18912190"," That's what we did back on that date."
"18912430","18915970"," In February or March, I feel today was doing this off top of my head. "
"18916150","18917050"," But I did look at it myself."
"18918050","18923690"," I looked at it last night on XLF and I was like, hey, if we roll here, it ain't going"
"18923690","18924110"," to be pretty."
"18925490","18926790"," It ain't going to be good. "
"18927190","18931630"," And then this morning, we got the four trigger pull cluster that are right on that target number."
"18932230","18934990"," And that was saying we were going up in a big way."
"18935050","18935830"," That's what we did today. "
"18935950","18936730"," We went up in a big way."
"18937290","18940510"," So switched from defensive to offensive."
"18940770","18942870"," And of course, that's what we did all day long is go up. "
"18947130","18948330"," Yeah, futures will be fun."
"18949810","18951570"," I don't want to get into trading futures."
"18951990","18952450"," I don't know. "
"18952690","18957090"," I don't want to get into trading futures because it keeps me awake at nighttime and I fucking hate"
"18957090","18957230"," it."
"18957450","18962090"," Like, I like cash market because more normal hours, but then I'm on there fucking middle of the"
"18962090","18962990"," night trading this shit."
"18962990","18966730"," But I know some of you guys can't hedge. "
"18967270","18972690"," So I'm like, I got this whole other thing where I'm like, I got this whole entire thing where I"
"18972690","18975190"," know some of you guys are only trading cash market."
"18975570","18976870"," I'm almost positive of it."
"18977570","18983790"," So they could put like one, three, four, five thousand dollars in an account and hedge yourself at"
"18983790","18984030"," nighttime. "
"18984370","18985610"," It would serve you well."
"18987250","18991330"," It would help you to take less losses, believe it or not."
"18993390","18997730"," So if you see the market start to sell off the middle of the night, if you see the market"
"18997730","19002950"," bounce anything like that, support step in anything like that, you need to shift. "
"19003250","19004130"," You need to be able to do that."
"19004390","19014150"," I think the bull case is, I truly believe that the bull"
"19014150","19019410"," case is to buffer whatever is coming down the road."
"19020350","19021930"," That's what I think most of this is. "
"19024690","19033630"," Even back from back in May, June and October of last year, it's just buffering for the eventual"
"19033630","19035090"," major role that we're going to get."
"19035750","19039630"," So I think we get that role in spring or I think it's spring time or late winter."
"19041590","19047710"," Could be now, could be now, I'm not a fucking crystal ball. "
"19049130","19050970"," But if they had a plan, I think it's something like that."
"19055670","19060830"," Yeah, if you got like three grand, I think if you had like 1,500, you could probably do the"
"19060830","19063170"," the micros or something."
"19064630","19065370"," Trade the micros. "
"19065470","19067410"," I wrote a whole bunch of stuff up for it too."
"19067530","19071210"," So I got like a whole, I have an outline of what to talk about with you guys, things you"
"19071210","19085570"," have to know about trading futures, benefits and it's"
"19085570","19088170"," not a logical, it's only it's logical at all."
"19088910","19093730"," You can actually look, you can actually look at every time we crash where it happens from, right?"
"19094550","19098750"," It happens on the top, not on the bottom, that's on the top. "
"19103630","19106770"," Every single fucking time, every single time."
"19110490","19112510"," There's one time where we fail to make a new high."
"19113090","19115230"," I think one, I think maybe two, one or two. "
"19117750","19122810"," I think when I looked it up, it was two in the complete history of the stock market."
"19123910","19125510"," Not once every two years."
"19126330","19135110"," If you look up the number of times we kept going on, thousands, thousands and"
"19135110","19142030"," thousands and thousands of times. "
"19145070","19149190"," Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and"
"19149190","19150070"," thousands and thousands of times."
"19150670","19152130"," You can take them off every time."
"19153130","19155330"," We'll go look, we can look at them one Sunday if you want. "
"19155510","19158830"," We can do a show, do weekends show, cut them all off for you."
"19159790","19160590"," Cut them all off."
"19161390","19164230"," You got two times where you didn't get the new to the all-time high. "
"19164810","19171250"," Even if you rolled, you still got that all-time high."
"19172030","19174310"," When you failed to get the all-time high."
"19176210","19180210"," The number of times that we actually went up there and got that all-time high and then rolled down"
"19180210","19181790"," is a small number. "
"19182570","19183710"," We still got that all-time high."
"19186110","19189410"," The number of times that we actually got that all-time high haven't continued higher."
"19190530","19193170"," You don't even want to count those thousands. "
"19196490","19200930"," So the probability is not on your side, that's my point."
"19202750","19203770"," It's not on your side."
"19204270","19207610"," You're making like a .001 percent bet. "
"19209690","19210610"," They like the apples."
"19219040","19222980"," Yeah, they have to get, they have to do it between now and six."
"19224300","19226160"," Sometimes they let them, sometimes they let them close. "
"19226860","19230840"," There's a shit ton of puts in the market that could pay them though too, so there's like more"
"19230840","19231740"," reasons here."
"19232840","19234580"," You're fucking painting, man."
"19235320","19236440"," Fucking squeeze it. "
"19246520","19247140"," Squeeze it."
"19249300","19251000"," Slamming all that supply up there."
"19254590","19256290"," Smash above the daily trigger. "
"19265750","19266910"," That's my phone dead."
"19267470","19267750"," Uh-oh."
"19271470","19274570"," I haven't gone to the bathroom all day long in my whole minute piss here. "
"19277330","19280690"," Let's take a look at, uh, let me look in the background here, let me look at NVDA."
"19282010","19285050"," We did a whole segment on NVDA today."
"19285910","19286590"," Let's take a look at it. "
"19288450","19290470"," Still riding high, still riding above."
"19291470","19299170"," Still hasn't tagged, it's upper limit up here at 478.78. We're going to see if we can squeeze up"
"19299170","19300590"," there and then sell down on the close."
"19300990","19301650"," We'll see if that happens. "
"19303190","19306710"," The phone was dead, like nobody's been calling me all day long, I've been quiet over here."
"19308170","19321560"," Oh yeah, NVDA's"
"19321560","19323720"," tracking the S&P 500 here."
"19329730","19335110"," If you're a long NVDA, man, if we trade 478.78, let's take the money and run. "
"19337630","19341990"," Let's close that shit right before the bell and be like, I'm outta here, take the money and run."
"19346660","19352620"," I'll tell you what though, if I have one thing to say, we'll bring it up during, we'll look at"
"19352620","19353100"," this at 4."
"19353300","19357980"," As a matter of fact, it's 3.19. Give me 5 minutes, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, I'm gonna"
"19357980","19358740"," go to the potty here."
"19360300","19363300"," I gotta put a limit on my calls here, hold on a second. "
"19396460","19400820"," Okay, I gotta limit, I gotta limit, hold on a second, here's the word."
"19401820","19405960"," Give me 5 minutes, I forgot we gotta do this after our shit."
"19406260","19407600"," Gotta go potty, really bad. "
"19410640","19411620"," Too really bad."
"19414740","19416480"," Give me 5 minutes, I'm gonna go potty."
"19416760","19418360"," I'm gonna tell you something before we get into this close. "
"19419440","19420640"," They announced a split, dude."
"19422720","19428520"," Moon time, moon time, it's the only thing they can do, I don't think they can do anything else to"
"19428520","19429320"," get that moon time."
"19430180","19435340"," I think if they blast off on good earnings, they're gonna take the money and run at the top. "
"19436500","19437540"," That's what I think happens."
"19437920","19440120"," But if they announced like split, then it ain't stopping."
"19444260","19447360"," Right back in like, I'll be back in 5 minutes, gotta go potty. "
"19448500","19451200"," Matter of fact, today I'll grab a whiskey."
"19451620","19458180"," So if you wanna grab some tea, grab some soda, we'll have a little toast here, I'm gonna move this"
"19458180","19459060"," so it's not in your way."
"19465100","19466900"," Leave that nice and bright right there. "
"19470780","19477260"," So as we go to this close, as we go to this close, I'm gonna grab a bourbon actually, and"
"19477260","19478340"," we'll have a toast together."
"19478620","19480380"," Grab some water, grab a spliffy."
"19480860","19482200"," You guys wanna see a spliffy?"
"19483500","19488860"," I had a gift given to me and I don't smoke marijuana, I don't smoke weed at all, but you"
"19488860","19490360"," wanna see what I was given?"
"19490760","19492320"," When I come back, I'm gonna show you what I was given. "
"19493380","19496020"," I would send it to you if you were in a legal state."
"19496440","19498440"," You wanna see what a legal marijuana state will give you?"
"19498800","19499920"," I don't think it's hilarious."
"19500180","19500800"," Hold on a second here. "
"19501240","19502280"," I'll be right back, okay?"
"19502480","19503180"," It'll be 5 minutes."
"19729000","19730280"," All right, here I go, I'm back."
"19732740","19737300"," We'll set up, I think, tight here. "
"19737960","19739080"," I gotta be here."
"19740060","19740820"," Hard block."
"19742440","19743680"," Back up there. "
"19746960","19747940"," Can I show?"
"19749600","19755640"," Does anybody know if I can show marijuana on Twitch?"
"19757800","19760820"," Does anybody know if I can show marijuana on Twitch or not?"
"19761760","19763180"," Can't even show it or no?"
"19763440","19764200"," I don't know if I can."
"19765140","19766720"," It was like break the term."
"19766860","19768700"," I don't wanna break the term as a service or anything. "
"19770840","19771640"," What am I doing here?"
"19771760","19772160"," What's going on?"
"19773180","19775380"," Does anybody know out there if I can show marijuana?"
"19776520","19777340"," Am I allowed to?"
"19780600","19781440"," Yeah, I don't know."
"19781840","19787060"," Oh, they roll up to not show it just to be safe."
"19787380","19788440"," Oh, a couple things. "
"19789100","19793420"," I don't smoke marijuana, but I have grown it once."
"19793420","19795920"," So I moved to Michigan and they were like, it's legal here."
"19796040","19796760"," You can do it every once. "
"19797620","19798800"," And I'm like, I love gardening."
"19799300","19804280"," So I did grow marijuana patch three years ago, four years ago or something."
"19804520","19807480"," I grew a patch one year and it was kind of fascinating. "
"19807480","19807980"," It was fun."
"19808280","19809320"," I had a really good time."
"19809480","19814600"," Had a little like, I had a, what is it called?"
"19814880","19824100"," Like a greenhouse with it and I grew something called everything it was called. "
"19825720","19826900"," Gorilla glue number four."
"19827180","19828720"," I think number three, number four, I don't know."
"19829260","19832660"," So I grew a bunch of marijuana and I'm like, I grew a ton of it. "
"19832840","19834320"," I didn't know that I grew that much."
"19834540","19838600"," I followed all the books, watched YouTube videos, did all the cool stuff."
"19838740","19840280"," It was really therapeutic, loved it. "
"19842080","19846800"," And I grew like these nuggets that were like, the size of a baseball."
"19847640","19848500"," They were huge."
"19850000","19851300"," And I didn't know what to do with it. "
"19851460","19852740"," I'm like, what am I gonna do with those marijuana?"
"19854020","19854780"," It's a story."
"19855040","19856300"," So like, I don't know what I'm gonna do with this shit."
"19856640","19857280"," I don't know what to do. "
"19858240","19862300"," And my wife is friends with people all in our neighborhood and stuff, right?"
"19862400","19864000"," Our whole community, she's like social butterfly."
"19864660","19865860"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"19866080","19868820"," So I'm like, why don't you give it away to anybody that wants it?"
"19869440","19872760"," So she gave it away to a bunch of friends, a bunch of women, dude. "
"19873780","19874180"," Seriously."
"19876060","19876740"," And they took it all."
"19877320","19882700"," She was like giving like brown trash bags full of like pounds of marijuana away to people. "
"19883720","19884540"," I don't know, it was pounds."
"19884860","19886100"," But you know, like it looked like a lot of marijuana."
"19888060","19889820"," And so we did that, right?"
"19890360","19894000"," So I just got a gift basket and hold on here. "
"19894880","19896860"," I gotta bring NVDA up here."
"19898820","19901780"," So I got a gift basket and I need this over here."
"19901900","19902140"," Hold on. "
"19905540","19906580"," I'll meet that right there."
"19907000","19907740"," And I don't smoke marijuana."
"19908380","19909220"," So I don't know what to do. "
"19909460","19910200"," What am I doing here?"
"19910340","19911140"," What's going on with this?"
"19911420","19915220"," So I don't know what to do."
"19915800","19918800"," It wasn't much, but I thought it was kind of funny."
"19919780","19921540"," So I'm going to show you what was given to me. "
"19922220","19925940"," I thought it was kind of hilarious, because I'm assuming if you're from a state where it's not"
"19925940","19926340"," legal."
"19927260","19929020"," Oh, that squeeze, baby."
"19929660","19931040"," I'm still long calls here, by the way. "
"19931840","19934060"," But I was, I don't like this thing open."
"19935060","19935940"," Look at this thing."
"19937280","19938640"," This thing is insane. "
"19940260","19943700"," I don't know what I'm doing with this stuff, but here I'll just, I'll put it up."
"19945400","19947580"," Look at that thing."
"19948540","19949540"," What is that?"
"19950580","19952880"," Oh, it smells good. "
"19953980","19955360"," Can I get it to zoom in or no?"
"19958800","19960620"," It's like a spliffy."
"19960780","19961760"," It's like a cone."
"19963120","19964520"," It's all like folded in. "
"19965240","19967240"," I feel like a filter on it and stuff."
"19968180","19970640"," I think the size of my hand, it's pretty big."
"19970640","19971640"," Look at that thing. "
"19973060","19974580"," What am I supposed to do with that thing?"
"19975880","19977080"," They gave me a bunch of them."
"19977200","19979560"," They gave me like, they're all on tubes and stuff."
"19984340","19988800"," I had to keep it in a locked drawer too, so I don't think I leave this stuff out. "
"19988860","19990560"," I got a locked office drawer."
"19991140","19992700"," Put it back in that bag."
"19996160","20002720"," So I remember, I remember when I was a kid, like you'd see people with like a doobie or something"
"20002720","20003740"," with like a paper roll. "
"20004120","20005920"," These days it's like all complicated."
"20011560","20013300"," Oh, come on with the drama, dude."
"20013500","20014120"," Just squeeze it. "
"20016840","20017660"," Squeeze it, dude."
"20017840","20018020"," Seriously."
"20018980","20020320"," You know you want to go there. "
"20022200","20023640"," You know where you want to go."
"20023900","20024500"," Go to your home."
"20025940","20026640"," Go to Valhalla. "
"20027460","20028320"," Go to the daily trigger."
"20029620","20030320"," Go to R3."
"20031040","20031980"," Make it happen. "
"20033020","20033840"," What are you doing?"
"20034860","20036840"," Are you, we're waiting."
"20038420","20039680"," What are you waiting for?"
"20039800","20041800"," Are you waiting for NVDA?"
"20044760","20048060"," Yeah, like they're like, they make marijuana look sexy here."
"20049360","20053880"," It's not like that, like you'd see like a kid in college, like a beat up rolled paper. "
"20054880","20058680"," We all like gross looking and like small, these things are like shaped."
"20060060","20061200"," Like all perfect and stuff."
"20061760","20064260"," I have no idea what the fuck these people are doing with marijuana these days. "
"20076560","20078380"," Yeah, no, I think that's great."
"20078640","20079480"," So to me, that's crazy."
"20079560","20080340"," I'm not a pot smoker. "
"20080720","20085120"," I don't know how much marijuana is in that thing."
"20085220","20086420"," It looks small, I guess, on camera."
"20086660","20089380"," Maybe I should do a bigger picture of it. "
"20090240","20092340"," It's like the, it's like the, I got big hands."
"20092740","20095640"," Like I wear an extra large to double extra large glove."
"20096440","20097760"," My hands are giant. "
"20099880","20102980"," Like I have giant hands, like big ass hands."
"20104780","20110820"," We're like a 12 and a half shoe, six foot, one and a half or something."
"20111320","20113940"," Not tall though, long arms though, super long arms. "
"20114600","20118420"," And this thing is like the size of my pointer finger."
"20125370","20126990"," I'm assuming that it's potent shit."
"20127170","20127730"," It smelled good. "
"20129070","20130490"," I'm not going to say it doesn't smell good."
"20130610","20131090"," It smells good."
"20132110","20133970"," Maybe I'll make brownies or something with it. "
"20135150","20139870"," I'll make like the wife and I, maybe if they took the wife or something, just her and I alone,"
"20141430","20144310"," make like something and surprise her."
"20144470","20146050"," Be like, I got marijuana brownies."
"20147270","20149370"," I'm going to try them while the kids are gone this weekend. "
"20149370","20149870"," We'll get crazy."
"20151550","20152310"," We'll get naked and shit."
"20152470","20152970"," Run around naked. "
"20154150","20155090"," I'll chase y'all over the house."
"20157870","20160270"," I have no idea what it is, no idea."
"20164690","20165930"," Yeah, I'm not a marijuana smoke. "
"20165930","20168210"," I don't smoke marijuana."
"20168790","20170330"," Oh, by the way, but guess what I do do?"
"20170830","20171850"," I do drink."
"20173770","20177490"," So I got some bourbon here for all you NVDA bulls. "
"20178910","20182750"," Maybe give a toast to you tech bulls that have held strong."
"20184670","20186390"," Coming to the end of tech earnings."
"20186770","20187470"," One of the big dogs. "
"20194420","20195920"," He spoke two more."
"20197740","20199840"," I never, I couldn't do drugs when I was in the army."
"20200040","20202800"," So there was like, can't do all this stupid shit when you're in the army. "
"20203000","20203900"," So I never got into it."
"20204560","20206880"," I got friends though, family, successful people."
"20207080","20208020"," I know smoke tons of weed. "
"20208200","20209520"," So I'm not anti-smoking weed."
"20210160","20211420"," I know that it works for some people."
"20215640","20219620"," I'm not anti-smoking weed or drinking or any of that kind of stuff either. "
"20219880","20223080"," I don't take any like stance against it."
"20224440","20228560"," For all the misery you have in your life, you need to smoke smoke a doobie, have at it."
"20228660","20230240"," If that keeps you sane, keep doing it. "
"20230860","20231640"," That makes you happy."
"20231780","20232320"," Keep doing it."
"20234080","20235180"," I just watched a."
"20236460","20238500"," Oh, that's another conversation for the other time. "
"20239080","20239780"," I watched a."
"20243280","20244780"," A biographical film."
"20247120","20249480"," And it was fascinating to see."
"20251380","20255520"," It was fascinating to see that it really pulled on. "
"20259320","20265990"," It really pulled on like two arguments."
"20266750","20268050"," I'll tell you guys, hold on a second here."
"20268050","20268730"," I'm just going to find it. "
"20268850","20269350"," Hold on a second here."
"20271410","20272370"," We're going to bring up."
"20272550","20273150"," We're coming to the close. "
"20273510","20275190"," We've got what, half an hour left here."
"20277310","20281130"," As we get close to the close, we will bring up the NVDA chart for you."
"20281850","20283430"," We'll see how this plays itself. "
"20283430","20284170"," Right now."
"20286150","20287970"," Calls are bouncing all over the place."
"20288190","20289250"," They're trying to murder them in the background. "
"20291960","20294160"," I got a 444 C's."
"20295540","20298980"," This movie is even going to find it."
"20302000","20303860"," Watch this movie late night. "
"20312000","20313180"," So you'll find it here."
"20314780","20315740"," Right here."
"20317440","20318740"," I got a good one for you. "
"20320600","20330540"," If any of you guys are sailors or if you're older, it's kind of a fascinating"
"20330540","20338940"," watch because it does make you not want to drink or do drugs in any way, shape or form on"
"20338940","20339980"," the one hand."
"20341480","20346600"," And then on the other hand, oh, they're trying to shake me out here."
"20347680","20350160"," I know I probably shouldn't have calls here. "
"20350260","20350900"," It's probably weight."
"20351580","20354300"," It probably weights until like 4 o'clock."
"20356620","20358720"," They're going to grind me right into that 4 o'clock hour. "
"20359620","20361000"," They're like, we'll print them."
"20361100","20362340"," We're just not going to pay you for it."
"20363600","20367620"," So I watched this movie and I had mixed emotions and feelings about it. "
"20370020","20373580"," But this guy was old man."
"20373940","20375440"," I mean, he was old as fuck."
"20375440","20380940"," And not only was he old, he was always honest about who he was. "
"20382620","20391620"," And I think what happened was, I think what happened was people that have lost family members"
"20391620","20399920"," to not being who they, not what you want them to be for you."
"20400520","20405360"," Even if they were honest, hey, I'm this person, they get kind of angry about it."
"20406120","20412580"," So I can see the parallel to disappointment from people that have encountered this man in his life. "
"20413820","20415600"," And so it's a fascinating watch."
"20415820","20425700"," It's fascinating how it how this movie triggers emotions and thoughts and all this kind of stuff."
"20425880","20431540"," And what's really most fascinating about it was what are you doing?"
"20435080","20439580"," So I'm like kind of locked in now. "
"20439700","20442360"," I'm not selling kind of pissy about this."
"20442580","20443540"," They're just kind of killing these things."
"20443720","20445160"," So I'm just locked in until 4 15. "
"20446340","20447840"," So let me just ride or die."
"20448760","20453880"," Now this this movie was great because it makes you think about a bunch of stuff that makes you"
"20453880","20459260"," think about kind of life that you live was weird because some of the people that this guy pissed"
"20459260","20466880"," off, this guy was old old old old old old old and this guy lived a great life."
"20466880","20467820"," He lived probably more. "
"20468160","20473980"," He lived more of a Mick Jagger life than most people get to live five years of their life."
"20474520","20480960"," It seemed like it triggered some some inner demons of people that missed out on living a good life"
"20480960","20482540"," and that kind of stuff."
"20482540","20484780"," So I was really fascinated by this movie. "
"20486200","20490240"," And your life will likely take a role in what you think about this movie."
"20490920","20492900"," It makes the motions going through the entire thing."
"20493020","20495680"," I'm like, I was like, yeah, I really like this. "
"20495900","20496780"," Then I don't like that."
"20496940","20497980"," What the fuck is going on with that?"
"20498160","20501800"," Then I'm like, yeah, this guy's you know, that was like 80 fucking two years old."
"20501920","20504160"," I'm like, if I can live to be 82, I'll be happy. "
"20504760","20506380"," Like he's but he's living on borrowed time."
"20507000","20510860"," This guy was like 50 40 30s, even 60 doing that."
"20510860","20512240"," The stuff that he was doing at the end. "
"20513760","20517760"," Anyways, I want to post this link to you at nighttime tonight."
"20518340","20521460"," If you smoke weed, watch this movie after you smoke some weed."
"20521980","20525420"," If you drink, have a few cocktails, watch the movie drink tea and water. "
"20526520","20529500"," You're probably going to want to piss off people because somebody had been in your life in your"
"20529500","20530020"," life or something."
"20530240","20531120"," But hold on a minute."
"20531620","20536980"," I'm going to post the link right now and bookmark this for yourself for later. "
"20537780","20538820"," There's a link to it."
"20540860","20542900"," And watch this movie on your own time."
"20543080","20543700"," I think it's fascinating. "
"20543860","20548140"," If you're older, it's a great movie because I'm not old yet, but I'm getting old."
"20548300","20551080"," And I'm like, uh, I got to think about this stuff as I get older."
"20552620","20555340"," So it led to a lot of introspection for myself. "
"20557180","20558380"," Yeah, keep on going up."
"20558740","20559880"," Keep on, don't come down."
"20560500","20560980"," Keep going up. "
"20562280","20563400"," We're not done here."
"20568030","20570770"," We know it should be zero losses today."
"20571530","20573890"," I haven't lost a single fucking trade today. "
"20573990","20574570"," I'll be honest with you."
"20574610","20575330"," You're not a single one."
"20576650","20578730"," I've taken a bunch of fucking trades today. "
"20580450","20581650"," I just posted it."
"20582590","20586350"," I just posted it inside the stream inside the chats, both streams."
"20591970","20595830"," Yeah, I think they're going to try to murder these calls until after four. "
"20595990","20599950"," And then you got to hold them until the fucking route until you get the fucking NBDA bullshit."
"20603370","20606610"," I can just see like a little dealer on a hamster wheel right now."
"20607790","20609250"," Can't pay those out right now. "
"20609470","20610390"," Got to hold them in the 415."
"20615750","20617190"," I just posted it."
"20617350","20617910"," It's right there. "
"20617990","20618790"," I just posted it on YouTube."
"20619050","20619230"," It's right."
"20619370","20620270"," You guys don't see the chat. "
"20629050","20630270"," I love you, Shaq."
"20634050","20634410"," That's right."
"20634670","20635250"," Print this shit. "
"20636470","20637170"," Print it."
"20641820","20642780"," Oh, come on."
"20666800","20668000"," Yeah, there you go. "
"20668280","20668640"," There you go."
"20668760","20670620"," Take all those bears for a ride right now."
"20672800","20675340"," Take all those bears for a ride right now. "
"20676460","20678040"," Squeeze every last one of them out."
"20678480","20679480"," Make them panic up here."
"20715620","20717080"," You want some jams in the background?"
"20717940","20722940"," We're going to switch over here to some, I don't know what I did with the, I should have put"
"20722940","20724000"," Tesla jams on. "
"20724460","20725580"," I don't know what I did with it."
"20726780","20729520"," I don't know what in the hell I did with Tesla jams."
"20730220","20731420"," Like the waiting room music for Tesla. "
"20731700","20734360"," I'll just, how about I put on some, I don't know what I did."
"20734700","20739060"," I think I was trying to look for more for new music and that's right."
"20739280","20739960"," Keep printing that shit. "
"20740360","20743540"," Print, print, print, print, print, print, print it up."
"20744580","20745600"," Keep on grind, baby."
"20746560","20747220"," Show me that grind. "
"20748180","20748980"," Show me that grind."
"20757950","20759390"," Show me that grind up there."
"20771220","20772580"," Show me that grind you got there. "
"20772740","20773040"," Come on, bulls."
"20778570","20779310"," Show me that grind."
"20779490","20780310"," Show me that money up there. "
"20780670","20781330"," Make it, make it rain."
"20782330","20782530"," Keep going."
"20784010","20785530"," Fading 39 cents right now. "
"20787750","20788390"," Come on, baby."
"20799340","20800440"," Yeah, you see that panic?"
"20800860","20801680"," That's seller rutrow?"
"20803120","20803980"," That's where you're going to."
"20805520","20806980"," That's where you're going to set them back. "
"20810360","20811660"," For the pain comes on."
"20811780","20812760"," It's a pain trade right here."
"20817570","20818810"," I put that pain on. "
"20821250","20822430"," Put that pain on."
"20835840","20836620"," That's bizarre."
"20838000","20840240"," A month ago you'd think we'd blast right through. "
"20840380","20840880"," We're at the bottom."
"20841080","20841660"," This is where you buy."
"20842980","20847820"," You actually buy, uh, this is the stuff that you buy. "
"20877730","20880310"," I got two jams, baby."
"20882630","20883710"," Some jams."
"20904920","20905580"," Bull jams. "
"20908600","20910200"," I don't want to."
"20916980","20924420"," We're going to look up, uh, we're on a second."
"20924600","20925320"," I don't know. "
"20925520","20926360"," Another chart here."
"20926500","20927200"," Hold on a second here."
"20957980","20960460"," The clothes here on spoons. "
"20960960","20962200"," There's Valhalla for you."
"20962380","20962740"," Hold on here."
"20975010","20977610"," We're going to set weakness here in the clothes and then BDA. "
"20990930","20994830"," 46320 is where I said we would close on NVDA."
"20995410","21003250"," I said that was 46320."
"21005630","21007610"," So I said we panic selling the clothes. "
"21011190","21012170"," Right there."
"21013350","21016430"," So my expectation is into the closing bell here."
"21018370","21020170"," Do we panic sell this down?"
"21022270","21024930"," After hours and then you're going to get your actual move here. "
"21025510","21027090"," And actually move there."
"21027530","21028750"," So far not happening, right?"
"21028950","21029750"," Kind of wrong here, right?"
"21030030","21030930"," Not, not, not accurate."
"21030990","21031990"," Not hasn't happened yet. "
"21033490","21038530"," And then we're going to talk about, uh, the targets."
"21041330","21082780"," We've got, uh, a daily trigger"
"21082780","21083320"," down here."
"21106260","21107700"," Complyed downside move. "
"21108400","21110080"," 426 up, 45."
"21126640","21129500"," 36293, if you're really bearish."
"21138650","21144690"," If you're really, really, really bearish, uh, into this clothes on NVDA. "
"21145870","21147990"," Low target, a couple of weeks."
"21150270","21151870"," Take a couple of weeks to get there."
"21154710","21156510"," So you're getting like nastiness. "
"21156890","21158390"," There's your downside targets."
"21163090","21163970"," Upside targets."
"21164970","21165010"," What?"
"21172320","21172920"," 47878. "
"21187960","21191340"," Great place to take money off the table unless they announce a split."
"21192240","21193760"," Right there, 478."
"21195640","21196240"," 84. "
"21196880","21210050"," Also remember"
"21210050","21215010"," that they love to take out or not take out their targets up or down."
"21215890","21222370"," So just note that if you're along the underlying, I usually fail to hit these implied numbers."
"21226410","21232670"," You also have until the 20 fifth for this to happen. "
"21234370","21240730"," So it would never be shocking to see just kind of like a moot point."
"21241150","21241450"," Tag that."
"21241670","21242590"," Come back down here. "
"21243050","21243630"," Tag this."
"21244690","21245170"," Right."
"21246130","21246610"," 25th. "
"21246850","21248570"," You could see that down move and that up."
"21248590","21249530"," Believe it or not."
"21249770","21251670"," Afterwards, depending upon how the year goes. "
"21252510","21253970"," So it just sounded like a baseline."
"21255110","21256790"," What the expectations would be."
"21258150","21259990"," Uh, if it's an okay ER. "
"21261130","21262450"," Upside target, 47884."
"21262710","21263350"," Downside target."
"21264910","21265390"," 46321. "
"21265810","21268090"," And even possible to get down to 44284."
"21268090","21271470"," Uh, this range seems normal."
"21272770","21276310"," Any kind of negative or positive heading into the 25th. "
"21276890","21281090"," Be looking for those other bands."
"21281690","21283010"," Oh, we get spy selling right now."
"21286870","21288790"," Spy selling right back down. "
"21296210","21298470"," Do we get a, do we actually get it at 430?"
"21298890","21299510"," I got to look that up."
"21303680","21307160"," We actually get the, uh, what time is the report?"
"21307160","21308640"," Let me turn on this other thing here."
"21308700","21309100"," Hold on a second. "
"21309500","21312180"," I'm going to turn that, I'm going to turn that off."
"21313200","21313880"," Hold on a second."
"21314020","21314620"," That's stuff I got to do. "
"21317100","21317500"," Launch."
"21319400","21320360"," Turn that up."
"21322380","21330460"," Uh, there was some news earlier that said, traders further target, dumbish fed policy pivot and so,"
"21330620","21331580"," uh, so for options. "
"21332140","21335180"," More upside flow has been seeing options, hedging the Fed's decision to cut rates."
"21335740","21339980"," As early as this year and into next year, the most recent dumbish flow is seen in December of 2023."
"21340240","21344760"," HU eight, eight options which paid a premium of around 3.5 million dollars. "
"21344860","21345700"," Can't trust that shit."
"21346700","21348300"," What time does the E.R. release?"
"21348700","21359180"," What time is, is, uh, just"
"21359180","21361620"," says aftermarket doesn't say the time though."
"21364220","21365680"," Just says aftermarket closed. "
"21365960","21368860"," So I don't have anything confirming the actual time of, uh, that release."
"21376370","21377250"," Is it at 420?"
"21378330","21379450"," Well, that's not good."
"21380070","21381790"," Uh, that's not good. "
"21383890","21386330"," If it really is at 420, that is not good."
"21388370","21390310"," I should have checked that earlier and I didn't."
"21391370","21393210"," No wonder it's being parked right here. "
"21394790","21399600"," I mean, shit, we've got till 420 to go down right now."
"21404320","21406360"," I'm, uh, I'm out of my calls right now."
"21406760","21408380"," I hit my stop on the bottom side. "
"21411020","21412840"," I never took profit up here though."
"21421640","21424520"," Here comes the bleed on NVDA into the close."
"21425280","21428860"," Am I going to get my early tap, tap down here by, by close here or not?"
"21429040","21429400"," I don't know. "
"21430920","21435340"," This 44 three right here, remember that big A we were talking about?"
"21436580","21440100"," This is, we still have all these calls pinning the market here."
"21440140","21441960"," So we've got 443 C's."
"21443080","21449280"," Now, 302,000 of those calls, four close today. "
"21449380","21450780"," They're not going to mean anything though, are they?"
"21451160","21455260"," We don't get the report until after 420 that those calls don't mean shit."
"21456400","21457840"," They're not going to print at all."
"21461220","21462880"," Yeah, time to horrible for options. "
"21463680","21464540"," Probably the intent."
"21465240","21470360"," Wasn't he one of the guys, uh, was or wasn't that weren't they one of the companies that almost"
"21470360","21472880"," like, um, what's the other company that does that shit?"
"21473300","21477380"," There's another tech company that does that that they would like release earnings early"
"21477380","21480360"," intentionally to fuck over the stock market participants."
"21480800","21483740"," I think that which company is right now into it's an Intel. "
"21483900","21485180"," I don't know what Intel or somebody else."
"21486200","21487540"," Who was it does that?"
"21494690","21498170"," Let me know in the chat, um, let me know in the chat real quick."
"21498170","21504770"," Are you going to, uh, hedge this close into tomorrow for that 442 440 target?"
"21505610","21506810"," Are you going to be flat?"
"21507330","21511050"," Just say, uh, I don't know, puts for the open tomorrow. "
"21512870","21515330"," Flat, uh, waiting for a dip to buy."
"21515990","21517190"," What else could you say?"
"21518470","21520730"," Um, long, long, long."
"21521670","21522310"," Bull, bull, bull. "
"21522830","21523790"," We're going up after the bell."
"21524150","21526150"," We're going to rocket ship up and VDA tomorrow."
"21526770","21527450"," Wake up tomorrow morning. "
"21527450","21531990"," We're trading 443 trading above the daily, daily trigger."
"21532770","21535150"," If we go low enough in here, I'm interested in it."
"21535690","21538230"," If we go down here, man, whoop, pull on here. "
"21541480","21547380"," If we go down here into this bell, if we start trading this kind of crap down here, like we"
"21547380","21549860"," get it like 415 and we're down here, some kind of nonsense."
"21551020","21553920"," I'm like, oh, no, man, like 414 in the afternoon."
"21554280","21554740"," We're down here. "
"21556040","21557100"," I might be willing to take that trade."
"21563610","21564830"," What are you saying right now?"
"21566630","21567590"," No, it's not Apple."
"21567590","21569670"," I'm thinking about, um, what the fuck?"
"21569750","21572730"," It's, uh, who thought they were getting TikTok?"
"21573010","21573510"," That company. "
"21573930","21576470"," I'm going to fuck not Microsoft, but the other one."
"21576650","21578410"," That company used to drop their earnings."
"21579750","21582550"," Uh, and he's probably blank used to say it publicly. "
"21583010","21584350"," Like I fucking hate the stock market."
"21586170","21587210"," No, it's not Microsoft."
"21587550","21590190"," The other company, whatever the other guy, the other chip maker. "
"21593660","21594800"," Is it oracle?"
"21594920","21595500"," It might be oracle."
"21596200","21596960"," It might be oracle."
"21598300","21599700"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"21599720","21600480"," It's Larry Ellison."
"21601380","21602180"," That's who it is."
"21602620","21603140"," You got it. "
"21603220","21603560"," You got it."
"21605220","21607260"," So flat cash waiting for the by the dip."
"21607560","21608940"," Flat, heavy, long, small hedge. "
"21609400","21611620"," Good job with the, uh, dude, Catterland."
"21611840","21612540"," Great name, by the way."
"21613780","21615700"," Uh, great name, Catterland. "
"21616140","21616640"," Dig it, bruh."
"21616740","21617340"," That's a good name."
"21618600","21620860"," Uh, dig it. "
"21620860","21624260"," It puts in the next week with calls in the morning, if it warrants."
"21624820","21626560"," Yeah, Jimmy Barry's got a good take on this."
"21627500","21628760"," Hedge in the Friday, right?"
"21628960","21629480"," Cause you never know. "
"21631700","21635860"," Not financial advice, but the truth is, I mean, Jimmy's right, right?"
"21636740","21641180"," Better to just be, uh, holding on, sitting on your hands until these guys get done with their"
"21641180","21642120"," fucking talking, right?"
"21643360","21644760"," Cause you don't really know what they're going to say."
"21646560","21649920"," We can, we can, we can, we can, we can, we can expound bullshit all day long."
"21651460","21653340"," I was watching, uh, some YouTube videos a week. "
"21653380","21654720"," I'm like, these guys are all bullshitting too."
"21654980","21657560"," I'm like, nobody has any idea where the fuck we're going."
"21665020","21666640"," Yeah, I couldn't remember who it was. "
"21667480","21669480"," It was Oracle, not a chip maker."
"21669780","21670280"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"21670380","21671040"," They're a software company. "
"21671340","21673100"," I used to own their, uh, not own base fees."
"21673340","21676240"," They're free, uh, they're, uh, word documents that they have."
"21678780","21681040"," And envy is not fucking reported until 420. "
"21682060","21683420"," Kind of ruined the whole end of the day here."
"21686120","21689360"," That's what I was very related to was, I think it was Oracle."
"21690320","21692820"," He would come out and say, uh, fuck the stock market. "
"21693320","21695280"," Fuck speculators or something."
"21698580","21711820"," So you've"
"21711820","21713480"," got my take on what to expect here."
"21714800","21716340"," You've got that big green air. "
"21716380","21717580"," We talked about that, right?"
"21719340","21722880"," Talked about the relief rally bounce down here."
"21723520","21725220"," We drew this this morning, right?"
"21726420","21728040"," Get that, like, panic in the overnight."
"21729020","21734200"," They come out and they do their talk all 10 a.m. They get dovish. "
"21735200","21736240"," We're off and running."
"21737840","21740660"," They're going to tell you the news will come out here that."
"21741860","21742280"," Expect. "
"21744220","21749640"," Expect, expect your own Powell to be a dove on Friday."
"21753640","21757380"," And if you don't get a dovish, uh, speakers tomorrow, you're going to sit, you're going to hear."
"21758160","21766480"," Oh, if those little Fed presidents are bearish and hawkish, expect their power to be bearish on"
"21766480","21766840"," Friday. "
"21767120","21769620"," In fact, they'll be doveish if they're, if they're hawkish."
"21775220","21778460"," One big thing here though is are you going to ride this with some?"
"21778460","21785530"," Man, you guys are so bearish, dude."
"21786350","21788930"," Fucking loaded tits with putts for tomorrow. "
"21789210","21789730"," What are you doing?"
"21792550","21795350"," You like the whole market is hedged here."
"21795950","21797130"," Are you crazy?"
"21799310","21804810"," You guys are all, you get, dude, have you guys not heard, have you guys not heard?"
"21805250","21806170"," I should have bought that right there."
"21807270","21810050"," You can't all be hedged and expect to get paid. "
"21810630","21811630"," Fuck is wrong with you guys."
"21814740","21815800"," Oh, here we go."
"21816860","21818940"," You guys are all expecting doom tomorrow. "
"21819420","21821440"," I'm looking at the options chamber tomorrow."
"21821620","21822940"," It's like everybody owns puts."
"21823860","21825840"," You guys all own puts for tomorrow?"
"21826440","21828120"," You guys are out of your minds. "
"21831230","21834210"," I'm thinking about buying some fucking cheap ass zero dates."
"21835290","21835850"," Great."
"21836230","21838190"," Nobody on calls for tomorrow, like nobody. "
"21854520","21855340"," All right."
"21856620","21857920"," Very small position."
"21859100","21861220"," It's a tiny position. "
"21863220","21866060"," Long calls for tomorrow because I don't believe you guys."
"21867220","21869220"," I don't, I just buy, I just threw them out."
"21869320","21869700"," I didn't even care. "
"21869880","21870260"," It's like here."
"21870640","21872900"," Buy some calls for tomorrow because they're all fucking short."
"21873560","21874960"," This whole fucking market is short. "
"21875320","21876620"," You got, are you guys out of your minds?"
"21881230","21882890"," Well, I bought 446s."
"21884430","21886390"," Have I just bought 446s?"
"21889810","21890670"," Yes or how do you mind?"
"21890790","21892670"," Do you see the number of puts on the market for tomorrow?"
"21892990","21893850"," You guys are savages."
"21896230","21897970"," We're going to find out real quick, aren't we?"
"21898170","21899890"," I guess now that I get calls, it's not going to matter. "
"21900490","21903050"," I guess we'll stick around until 4.20 and see what happens with."
"21903310","21904510"," We'll know if my shit's going to burn."
"21905530","21907190"," We'll, we'll know here in just a few minutes. "
"21907330","21909890"," I guess I'm riding with the NVIDIA nerds."
"21912130","21915010"," We'll stick around until 4.20 to see what this report says."
"21918150","21921890"," I guess I'm riding long dong synthetically with, with the bulls. "
"21921990","21922950"," I hope it'll get torched here."
"21923010","21925150"," It's not a big position, so it's small."
"21925490","21926690"," It's very, very small. "
"21927530","21929030"," This is, we're gambling now."
"21929150","21929910"," Remember that, we're gambling."
"21930270","21933050"," We're going to remove that because we're closed now. "
"21935750","21939330"," Sellers, rutrow, panic above, Valhalla daily trigger up in here."
"21940410","21943410"," We want to know what this is right here, after we sell, immediately sell off this."
"21944950","21946830"," You're not making money right fucking now. "
"21946830","21948170"," I'm making money right now."
"21952050","21954490"," I bought that, bottom of that red bar now."
"21954630","21955430"," That's a five-minute candle. "
"21955650","21956610"," I bought that right there."
"21957310","21959130"," That tick right here I bought, I bought this one."
"21960270","21960950"," Right there. "
"21964240","21965940"," It's about this bad boy right here."
"21968440","21969580"," Yeah, there's savages."
"21971280","21977100"," Maybe we can synthetically trade this, even if it doesn't report until, until fucking, until 4.20."
"21986110","21989050"," Whoa, whoa, what they did to me here?"
"21989170","21990210"," What's that bar right there?"
"21990310","21992330"," What the fuck, what's that shit right there?"
"21992450","21993270"," What's this ghost print?"
"21994990","21997550"," What's that, you're trying to get out of your short?"
"21997850","21998530"," What is that bullshit?"
"22000370","22001110"," What is that?"
"22001390","22002870"," Did somebody break the news to you?"
"22003430","22005670"," What the fuck is that right there?"
"22007350","22008590"," Nothing to see here, boss. "
"22011380","22012720"," Nothing to see here, boss."
"22015320","22016320"," Damn, look at that."
"22017780","22019500"," Nothing to see here, boss, man. "
"22020080","22020460"," Right, nothing."
"22020920","22022160"," Who gets to do that?"
"22023280","22025600"," Like, who is that that does that?"
"22026580","22027620"," That ain't you and I."
"22028480","22029760"," We don't get to do that."
"22029960","22030180"," Do we?"
"22030360","22030720"," Look at that. "
"22036240","22036680"," Nice."
"22037480","22038520"," I'm making money right now."
"22039540","22041340"," What the hell is this down here?"
"22041520","22042180"," What's that scam?"
"22045380","22047360"," Who got out from underneath being poor?"
"22047480","22048880"," Who was like, I don't want to be short anymore. "
"22049140","22049460"," I want out."
"22050300","22052520"," We don't get to, we don't get this, do we?"
"22052660","22053640"," Do we get that down there?"
"22053780","22054120"," What's that?"
"22056380","22058080"," Dude, what is all that down there?"
"22059520","22064180"," Do they have an option where I can call up my broker and say, please dump it down for a"
"22064180","22069560"," half a second so I can close my short for profit and take it long here for a few moments?"
"22070520","22072300"," Dude, who the fuck is that shit?"
"22101020","22102240"," Come on, baby."
"22105280","22106260"," Yeah, who is that?"
"22106440","22107460"," Who's allowed to do that?"
"22109320","22110760"," We both charts are really good. "
"22111100","22113640"," They're like, they're not the best, but they're really good."
"22125270","22128130"," They're not like the best charts, but they show a lot of stuff."
"22129170","22131950"," They're like for free charts, they're pretty much the best. "
"22132750","22135970"," Like free charts, they got some of the best data."
"22136530","22142250"," Like the, I don't know what this Chinese company is doing, but they buy the gangster data, gangster"
"22142250","22142610"," data."
"22147300","22148180"," Yeah, exactly. "
"22148400","22149280"," It's all those guys, right?"
"22151400","22154100"," I've got a pre-sell on my calls just in case."
"22155200","22157220"," So I got like a, hey, what's up, buddy?"
"22159120","22162940"," I got a pre-sell on some calls just in case we green bar it up right here."
"22164560","22166200"," Oh, yeah, love you too, handsome boy. "
"22168640","22173520"," So if we do any kind of, we do any kind of like, whoop, just go up there and tag"
"22173520","22173800"," that."
"22175760","22177900"," We can kind of like tag it up here by 415."
"22180340","22183180"," We've got another nine minutes, or how many minutes have you got?"
"22183260","22184000"," Nine minutes left. "
"22184480","22187180"," Let's see if they do some arbitrage in here."
"22190480","22192480"," See if the numbers have leaked."
"22194160","22194700"," Yeah. "
"22211390","22213350"," Well, I bought this bar down here."
"22213430","22214090"," I bought this one."
"22215910","22217990"," I bought this bar right here. "
"22223360","22230280"," But I guess my point would be if I can capture any of that quickly before 415, I'll cut them."
"22230900","22234320"," If I don't capture it, I'll probably hold them in tomorrow."
"22236300","22237100"," So we'll see. "
"22238100","22239500"," It's a gamble, it's pure gamble."
"22239700","22243480"," I wouldn't be fucking, you don't ever trade this for like, yeah, so I make my money."
"22244080","22248860"," Oh, oh, where we going?"
"22250920","22252460"," Where are we going?"
"22252780","22254360"," Oh, PT1. "

"22305500","22309720"," Right up here, time to get out of cold long calls on queues or spoons."
"22313460","22314860"," This is your chance."
"22315820","22318140"," Getting that nice little bump up here. "
"22319380","22321900"," Few bars up here, looking pretty up here."
"22322280","22323840"," Not a bad little trade right there."
"22324760","22325760"," What are you going to do?"
"22325900","22326920"," You're going to take the money and run. "
"22327220","22329600"," You're going to let it ride for what next four minutes."
"22330340","22331360"," Turn it back around now."
"22336750","22338970"," 477, 97. "
"22342920","22343880"," PT1 tag."
"22347890","22348670"," Close enough."
"22348870","22349470"," That's close enough. "
"22350730","22351790"," Yeah, I was eyeballing."
"22351970","22352290"," That's shit."
"22353230","22355430"," Oh, I wasn't technically looking at it. "
"22355510","22356730"," I was like, yeah, snap a line there."
"22357250","22358350"," Snap a little line there."
"22359750","22362070"," Look at that sneaky Pete, huh?"
"22363390","22368670"," Imagine being a bank and you're like, what do I care what the earnings are?"
"22368770","22375670"," I'm just going to go up here, get my target, take my money, exit, no more risk in the market. "
"22375890","22377710"," If we go up or down, it doesn't matter to me."
"22379470","22380770"," Look at that, baby."
"22385650","22387590"," Underline stockholders like taking the money here. "
"22387750","22388350"," I'm getting out of here."
"22389110","22389750"," Check my 470."
"22390230","22390870"," I'm going to wrap it up. "
"22397830","22399410"," Market is not a scam, right?"
"22410200","22411860"," Market's not a fraud, right?"
"22412080","22413020"," You're telling me this ain't fraud?"
"22413280","22413840"," You're going right here?"
"22414760","22416920"," Tell me that ghost print down there ain't fraud."
"22417140","22417820"," Come on, man."
"22418020","22423160"," Taking a look at the market for today's session, stocks climbed while bond yields fell after"

"22472470","22477850"," Separate data showed new home sales hit the highest in over a year, as the surge in mortgage rates"
"22477850","22481130"," kept inventory on the resale market extremely limited."
"22481590","22486950"," Traders also weighed a US government report saying that job growth in the year through March will"
"22486950","22493110"," probably be revised down by 306,000, a smaller adjustment than some economists expected."
"22497010","22501290"," The advance in bombs Wednesday was also attributed to the technical factors. "
"22501570","22507090"," That's after a treasury sell-off that recently drove 10-year yields to the highest since late 2007"

"22545420","22545760"," time."
"22546080","22549020"," So we do get n videos at Q2-2023 earnings."
"22549860","22555120"," It's estimated EPS from the video seen at $2.07. Looking at the one-year-in video, I think they"
"22555120","22555780"," do sell the news. "
"22556720","22561660"," I think the question is, I think the question is how much is too much?"
"22561980","22565080"," It's usually 150 to 300%."
"22565080","22569880"," And so just keeping an eye on the video, they did close the session up 3.17% ahead of"
"22569880","22573700"," this earnings sprints at the gains extending in post-market trade ahead of this."
"22574300","22581120"," So usually, usually if the first guys that get in, market maker is usually in the earliest, right?"
"22581640","22588780"," And then you figure by the time it's done on the low end, it's about 150% so that original"
"22588780","22596140"," buy-in and can go up to about 300% somewhere in there and right around that ballpark. "
"22605620","22606600"," Now I don't think it's bullish."
"22606980","22608960"," I'm looking at it more from a macro point of view."
"22608960","22610140"," I'm not looking at it more. "
"22612240","22616860"," We're not just macro, but I look at it more like market makers by cheap."
"22617200","22621320"," They sell hide into you, go back and do it all over again."
"22622020","22625000"," All like the bullish narrative and bearish narrative. "
"22625860","22629320"," I'm not as much of a fan of that as I am with greed."
"22629800","22636560"," I'm all about the greed, like accumulate, distribute, and then maximize the upside down sides on"

"22650240","22652860"," I do wonder who just bought that for 78."
"22653600","22655080"," I do wonder who bought that."
"22655380","22656100"," That is a good question. "
"22656880","22658000"," Like who bought this right here?"
"22659740","22662080"," Who's the buyer of last resort on that bad boy?"
"22664780","22667220"," Did like somebody say, yeah, it's 478."
"22667380","22668200"," I'm going to buy that shit."
"22668360","22669880"," I got an order in before 78. "
"22674360","22678290"," Just further analyst commentary."
"22679170","22680250"," Analysts on the wires here."

"22691090","22695290"," That's relative valuation came down sharply after the blowout Q1 earnings in May."

"22724300","22726820"," Get NVDA's Q2 23 earnings."
"22727300","22730740"," Estimated EPS has seen it two dollars and seven times like that."
"22730820","22734100"," But the estimated revenue at 11 spot is zero, four billion dollars. "
"22734600","22737800"," We get the initial rush up and they pull it all back and they start again."
"22761400","22764140"," Four and a half minutes left until we find out what's going on here."
"22764480","22765560"," We'll say this to you. "
"22765760","22767060"," I'll give you something if you are a bear."
"22768320","22776680"," If you see like meat expectations, if you see slightly beat expectations, oh, there goes spoos."
"22778140","22780680"," If you see anything like that, it's not good enough. "
"22780860","22781500"," We know that, right?"
"22781780","22788560"," You better be like farting fucking rainbows and golden eggs and you better be splitting or"
"22788560","22788860"," something."
"22789140","22790040"," Like you've got to hear something."
"22799050","22801070"," You're looking for the estimated numbers?"
"22801370","22804610"," Go to earningswhispers.com and they'll they have them there. "
"22806130","22807270"," What else has it?"
"22807410","22810370"," I can find it right now."
"22813130","22814570"," Finvis will have it, I think."
"22815130","22817790"," And Yahoo does a great job of expectations. "
"22822960","22824560"," But you got to beat hard and heavy."
"22824800","22826240"," That's the one I'll give that to."
"22826480","22828980"," I will give that to sellers. "
"22830220","22833400"," Can't just come in like, oh, we just skated by."
"22834580","22836540"," This is a big Tesla thing too."

"22850320","22853240"," Like, you say something like this."
"22854200","22856820"," You can, when you're like company, you're a growth company."
"22857620","22858280"," You say this. "
"22858760","22860760"," You better come in your earnings and say, we did that."
"22862060","22863420"," Then now we got this up here."
"22864180","22866460"," So that up there, whatever that is, I don't know what it is. "
"22867500","22869160"," I don't know what it is for NVDA."
"22869380","22870580"," It's got to be a split or something."
"22872140","22877760"," I don't know if like, they show their orders maybe and say, we're backlogged for the next 10 years,"
"22878320","22879040"," 15 years. "
"22879220","22880060"," We'll never catch up."
"22881100","22883780"," We're going to build like 16 factories this year."
"22884180","22884960"," Something like that. "
"22885080","22889860"," But even that, if you said they're going to build 16 factories in the US or something, you'd be"
"22889860","22891900"," like, oh shit, it's going to cost me a ton of money to do that."
"22892380","22893240"," So I don't know if that's bullish."
"22893240","22898480"," It'd have to be something that's like a magic rabbit out of a magic hat. "
"22898780","22900580"," Especially when your growth company has to be that."
"22900760","22905520"," It has to be like, beat heavy, beat hard, crushed expectations."
"22906680","22908100"," Oh, and by the way, there's a cherry on top. "
"22914110","22915530"," Yeah, ominous."
"22916070","22916750"," Yeah, exactly."
"22916990","22917670"," Let's be something stupid. "
"22920450","22924950"," Every company that's in a growth phase, if you don't do that in your ER, it's always sell the news."
"22926270","22927410"," Every single time."
"22932290","22933410"," Every single time. "
"22935450","22937130"," It's not like the growth is done."
"22937250","22938730"," It's not like they want something cheap to buy."
"22939450","22940390"," It's not even like negative. "
"22940610","22944650"," It's just, yeah, I want to buy it down at 360 and then we'll run it up again."
"22945190","22946250"," Some shit like that, you know."
"22949320","22950500"," I mean, let's look at that for a minute. "
"22950660","22951440"," Just right here, right?"
"22952220","22958060"," If you didn't have an expectations meet here, I would almost assure you that you would see."
"22958060","22960300"," I'm expecting the videos that Q2 results."
"22961040","22963180"," You would see this three 64. "
"22963620","22969680"," You can put that any kind of like, any kind of like misses and no good news."
"22970620","22971980"," You will see three 64."
"22972380","22973560"," You will you will fucking see it. "
"22974780","22975940"," That's almost what?"
"22976280","22978140"," Not quite half, but that's what 30%."
"22978140","22979520"," They will lock that right off."
"22979800","22980740"," Like it's nobody's business. "
"22985880","22986800"," Come on, baby."
"22991150","22993690"," One minute left until it supposedly drops."
"22995270","22999750"," If anybody's got those numbers, if they have them from Twitter, my Twitter's all fucked up for me"
"22999750","23000130"," right now. "
"23000910","23005570"," I got like a credit to lead all my tweets and then my tweet deck is all jacked up."
"23006570","23009630"," Like whatever Elon is doing is doing weird stuff right now."
"23023060","23025500"," Like high expectations here for NVDA. "
"23025500","23039580"," Okay, what"
"23039580","23041040"," has to do with the limit?"
"23042280","23043500"," They should build this group."
"23044760","23048700"," Listen, I must be honest, some kind of conversation in the video earnings prints."
"23056140","23061940"," Video earning coming through now, revenue of beats 13 spot 51 billion and estimates of 11 spot 0 4"
"23061940","23062300"," billion. "
"23062620","23065860"," Adjust the DPS of beats $2.70. That's my move."
"23066260","23072480"," 10 gross margins 71 spot 2% of beats on estimates of 7 spot 1.10 at a data center."
"23072740","23074860"," It's revenue coming into the beat. "
"23075080","23079200"," 10 spot 32 billion dollars and estimates of 7 spot 0.8 billion dollars."
"23079440","23085240"," The automotive revenue coming in at a miss $253 million on estimates of $300.000 Oh, mixed bag,"
"23085240","23085860"," mixed bag."
"23086240","23088920"," A gaming revenue of beats at 2 spot 49 billion dollars. "
"23089380","23092600"," On estimates of 2 spot 3, 8 billion dollars."
"23093220","23094780"," The forward guidance there."
"23094780","23096180"," They're seeing their revenue. "
"23096180","23097800"," Off your short right now."
"23097960","23098680"," And spoons."
"23098920","23100140"," Oh, wow. "
"23100300","23101240"," Five billion dollars."
"23101400","23102560"," Don't pace it outside."
"23102740","23103920"," For those guidance from the video. "
"23104160","23105700"," Grab your booze and work outside."
"23106060","23106540"," Take a walk."
"23107020","23109640"," Grab a 5% now and host market trade. "
"23109860","23109980"," Great."
"23110220","23111660"," Good decision strengthening in the end."
"23111720","23114740"," Grab an axe following this earnings release here. "
"23116920","23118040"," Grab an axe."
"23118540","23120860"," One side chopped in your rather large beat."
"23120860","23121740"," Panic until morning. "
"23121740","23122860"," Five five one billion dollars."
"23122980","23124040"," Oh, shit."
"23124180","23125260"," Four billion dollars. "
"23125520","23128600"," EPS will be keeping by around 63 cents."
"23128800","23131080"," If you're short right now, that's some P 500."
"23131340","23132880"," A few dollars and seven cents. "
"23135300","23136860"," Smoke a cigarette or something."
"23137320","23137720"," Grab a cigar."
"23138100","23139140"," I don't know what you're going to do here. "
"23139240","23141720"," Five billion dollars in share repurchases as well."
"23151710","23152610"," Daily trigger."
"23153310","23153610"," Hit. "
"23156650","23158430"," I'm going to leave you with something here."
"23158590","23161070"," We're going to talk about something defending these post market gains."
"23161210","23162250"," Up six percent now. "
"23164510","23165310"," Look it."
"23165610","23167490"," Look at NVDA."
"23169190","23170310"," Trading five. "
"23171650","23173710"," five oh eight."
"23175050","23176150"," Twenty three."
"23177550","23179430"," I got twenty three up here. "
"23179590","23179790"," Ghost."
"23179990","23180770"," I got some ghosting."
"23181510","23182710"," That's five oh eight. "
"23182890","23183610"," Twenty three."
"23183970","23186230"," Says five oh eight on when we will."
"23188550","23191470"," We're going to roll over to something really quick. "
"23191530","23193190"," If you're a bull or a bear."
"23194510","23196890"," If you're a panic seller here."
"23197890","23203990"," If you're at home listening to me right now and you're angry, angry, mad, upset, pissed, please do"
"23203990","23205110"," not hang up. "
"23206990","23209530"," Give me just a second here to deal with you guys."
"23213250","23213850"," Okay."
"23215310","23216530"," Here is ES. "
"23218830","23221610"," ES have nothing to do with this right now."
"23230750","23235890"," Now I'm going to show you two levels for you to be looking out on ES."
"23237290","23240150"," I'll do NQ for you as well. "
"23244580","23246940"," Forty four seventy two fifty to the upside."
"23248500","23251220"," And then don't be caught dead down here anywhere."
"23254120","23254600"," Okay. "
"23257660","23258940"," It's forty four thirty two."
"23259100","23261300"," This one will move though as as the night moves on."
"23261440","23262040"," This will come up. "
"23262720","23264720"," It'll be like a forty four twenty."
"23264920","23266500"," So this basically this level right here."
"23267720","23269460"," Take your money and run kind of stuff. "
"23269480","23270280"," So right there."
"23273160","23280220"," So if you're short ES or anything like that, you're going to be hoping and praying for some kind of"
"23280220","23283760"," a move up and then down like this and then down here."
"23284480","23285640"," What's you hoping for?"
"23286700","23290560"," Don't get squeezed out if we break above because it'll likely come back anyway. "
"23290820","23294200"," So if you're short ES, this applies to cues too."
"23294260","23295920"," If you're like a panic and now I'm freaking out."
"23297940","23299640"," Do that carry right over there. "
"23299640","23301620"," You got to like be able to carry it over here."
"23304100","23306460"," This likely does not hold if we go there."
"23307000","23308940"," It needs it needs. "
"23310520","23312280"," It needs this to follow here."
"23313860","23318120"," Like even if it looks all bullish and shit, it's still going to roll and come back down."
"23318280","23319960"," See if you still have it out is my point. "
"23320760","23321080"," Okay."
"23321300","23327280"," So if it does continue to go up, look for that out at four forty twoish."
"23327280","23331580"," Someone down somewhere down in here, you'll likely be giving an out. "
"23332040","23333040"," Thank you."
"23335800","23336800"," That's shit."
"23337820","23341040"," Thank you, man. "
"23341220","23347940"," I want you to see this here in NQ, okay."
"23348880","23355960"," On NQ, I'm not one that believes that NQ can go higher."
"23357900","23360160"," Without the hourly trigger, I'm not that guy. "
"23360500","23362860"," So we'll look in the 30 minute here, see if I'm wrong."
"23364600","23368260"," You know, you're probably going to get a squeeze up here on NQ."
"23368800","23371660"," You're probably going to get a squeeze. "
"23372020","23378960"," There's that target up there, but you'll be looking for these targets to sell by open tomorrow."
"23379160","23380800"," I'm going to warn you of something here."
"23383260","23393240"," Sorry, this is for me for NQ, but normally if we squeeze up, you'll get a chance to get out. "
"23394200","23397880"," I want to warn you though, you have the hourly trigger coming up right here."
"23400940","23406100"," So if that holds, can we start going up here?"
"23407620","23408700"," It's going to get nasty."
"23408960","23409660"," You're going to get a phone call. "
"23414250","23416590"," So just be really careful in here."
"23416590","23420310"," If you're like a tech short or something like that, worse than S&P 500."
"23421250","23424770"," Very dangerous if you're short NQ. "
"23426150","23427150"," Very dangerous."
"23427730","23428790"," I'm going to say something to you."
"23428830","23436150"," If you're a short dude like we go down here, get out of your fucking short until this here starts"
"23436150","23438290"," to go down to remake your money. "
"23439270","23441150"," But don't go short until you're under this."
"23441770","23443570"," Like closing bars, closing fucking bars."
"23444390","23446210"," It shouldn't be trading this shit if you don't know what I'm talking about. "
"23448230","23451650"," But there's real danger here if you're short NQ."
"23451790","23452570"," I didn't see that earlier."
"23454950","23457190"," You know, they close the fucking market for an hour. "
"23457470","23458970"," And before you know it, you're up here."
"23459350","23462490"," 6 p.m. rolls around and see you later."
"23463450","23465270"," Be really careful in a six o'clock here. "
"23468150","23470070"," That's a fucking trap in a half right there."
"23475260","23479740"," Yeah, yeah."
"23481160","23485620"," 15, 132, 15089, thoughts and prayers. "
"23486660","23496260"," If it reverses, if you start to see any action, like mark these numbers here, like 15, 210."
"23497500","23503240"," Like if you see stupid shit like this happening, and it starts to go up like that, fucking stops"
"23503240","23503960"," right there."
"23505600","23512960"," It ain't going to stop because you're going to see this hourly come up and it's going to be six"
"23512960","23513880"," o'clock in the morning. "
"23515380","23519500"," You'll know by six a.m. It like that's best case scenario for you."
"23520120","23523160"," I don't know what time this is here."
"23525640","23527180"," Probably be awake around. "
"23527480","23528900"," I mean, I tell you when you're going to be awake."
"23531540","23535640"," It's around nine o'clock."
"23537680","23540120"," It's somewhere around nine p.m. 11 o'clock tonight. "
"23540920","23545020"," I don't even think you get until 2 a.m. I think nine, nine p.m. you're going to know."
"23546560","23547940"," You'll probably have an out of nine."
"23548020","23548560"," I hope that you do. "
"23549040","23550780"," I don't want you guys to lose money if you're a bear, so."
"23552100","23553420"," Okay, so I'm going to leave you with this."
"23554000","23555800"," Switch back over into tomorrow. "
"23556840","23558200"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow."
"23558500","23560800"," Would not be surprised to see it all come back down by am."
"23561960","23565160"," We are above the daily trigger right now. "
"23565640","23566620"," Not bullish yet."
"23567600","23571080"," Needs to recheck daily trigger in cash market."
"23571440","23572440"," All this is fake. "
"23573760","23576880"," So like in cash market, you need to see price."
"23577780","23581340"," Come back down and test daily with the early underneath it."
"23582040","23584520"," Team begin to talk about being bullish here. "
"23584660","23586840"," So don't don't get started with like."
"23587600","23590100"," I want to see you on fucking fin to it being bullish."
"23590100","23593100"," Because the squeeze comes right back. "
"23593260","23596480"," It always, every time it comes, every single time it comes back."
"23597620","23600280"," It has to prove in cash market that it's going on."
"23604380","23607420"," Okay, so I will see you guys to mark. "
"23607600","23609000"," Do you guys have any questions before I go?"
"23609940","23611240"," See you guys in the morning."
"23614240","23616300"," Review where Nvidia is going."
"23616600","23617940"," So the implied move was hit. "
"23618920","23621760"," I haven't heard their guidance yet to see what they have to say."
"23622180","23624040"," Seems like they made their target."
"23624840","23630440"," Even if you get a pullback in NVDA, you'll likely see it tag it again during cash market. "
"23631200","23633360"," They have to announce something extra special."
"23633540","23636760"," Super duper for it to go any higher from where it is right now."
"23637620","23639240"," If they announce anything crazy. "
"23644930","23649690"," If they announce anything crazy, let me do a measure here."
"23649810","23650250"," Give me a second."
"23651330","23654670"," Dude, NQ is just fucking ripping right now. "
"23654950","23656610"," It is fucking ripping."
"23658470","23662920"," It is fucking ripping, right?"
"23663100","23663900"," Oh man, dude."
"23664420","23666480"," Oh man, oh man. "
"23667780","23668480"," No limit."
"23668680","23669280"," That's where I want to be."
"23669440","23670000"," Hold on a second here. "
"23670740","23672920"," Now you want upside targets for NVDA?"
"23674900","23675800"," Hold on a here."
"23679910","23681010"," One quick second."
"23690020","23691240"," I'm going to measure this shit. "
"23691360","23691640"," Hold on."
"23700540","23701320"," What am I doing here?"
"23702040","23702300"," Ready?"
"23709830","23711310"," Five fifty four seventy eight."
"23711470","23712650"," I don't think you get that right now, though. "
"23714890","23716570"," I don't think you get that right now."
"23716730","23717910"," Five fifty four seventy eight."
"23718110","23718470"," High target. "
"23719430","23720970"," I don't think you get that right now."
"23721030","23722670"," I'm not going to tell you that's going to happen."
"23722930","23724650"," I don't think you get that for some time period. "
"23738350","23739450"," There it is right there."
"23741410","23742950"," I don't think you get that right now."
"23743030","23744510"," I think they're going to fill those calls up. "
"23744530","23745550"," They're going to send it back down."
"23746590","23756310"," This is on board for you, though, if outside of market conditions, outside of options,"
"23758290","23760690"," outside of no bad news coming out."
"23761150","23761950"," The next half an hour. "
"23763470","23766850"," You're targeting five fifty four eighty one."
"23768050","23768650"," Seventy eight."
"23768770","23768930"," Sorry. "
"23769010","23769970"," I said eighty one."
"23770050","23770490"," Seventy eight."
"23773870","23775930"," It's twenty five billion in share buyback. "
"23782470","23784850"," Nino, I would just do the opposite all the time."
"23785290","23789590"," Whenever you hit the spy or sell button, just do the opposite, man."
"23790170","23791050"," I love you, brother. "
"23793570","23796550"," I think I think they were coming back."
"23796550","23801070"," So I'm assuming that the bears are gone right now."
"23801090","23803450"," I'm assuming then there's no more bears in the broadcast here. "
"23804570","23806390"," Tell the bears that I don't hate them or anything."
"23808750","23813030"," I think we pull back off and maybe unless there's something I'm missing."
"23813870","23815070"," It's mostly a function. "
"23815350","23816210"," I'm not wanting to pay it."
"23816390","23819310"," So the buyback's not good enough for right now."
"23819430","23821370"," It's like another after the twenty fifth. "
"23821390","23823130"," I think you make that move to the upside."
"23823310","23825030"," I could be wrong, but I think it's after the twenty fifth."
"23827250","23828170"," I love you, Nino. "
"23831590","23834510"," Let me too, Stacy."
"23835110","23836530"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow."
"23837390","23838770"," I'll see you at nine thirty in the morning. "
"23839590","23843250"," We'll play the interviews live for you at ten oh five."
"23844230","23845550"," See what they have to say."
"23846230","23847410"," And we'll see where this market's going. "
"23848710","23853490"," Four forty five oh one high tick on spoons closer to four fifty than we think, right?"
"23855670","23857590"," Closer than we think."
"23858370","23860470"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow."

"23870450","23870970"," I need some viewership."
"23871330","23872790"," So maybe get a high today."
"23873230","23875970"," The viewers of like five hundred and sixty or something. "
"23875990","23877070"," It's probably like two thousand viewers."
"23877790","23878910"," I want to make that next step."
"23879050","23880570"," So if you can do that for me, I'd appreciate it. "
