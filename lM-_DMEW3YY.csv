"lM-_DMEW3YY","0","7560"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here with your daily brief for Tuesday, August"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","7560","9280"," 17th, 2021."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","9280","15960"," Today we have a big economic calendar, we've got retail sales at 8.30, then we have the"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","15960","24040"," home builders at 10 a.m. and we have J.P.O. talking to students, I believe at 1 p.m."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","24040","27480"," This is these are the opportunities that the both the bears are going to try to use to"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","27480","31640"," drop this market, so you've got a full calendar ahead of yourself."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","31640","37400"," Just big news from yesterday really was that there will be no tapering until 2022."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","37400","46640"," The implication from that involves the symposium in Wyoming next week that begins on the 26th"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","46640","49000"," or 27th, whatever that Friday is."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","49000","54800"," That announcement yesterday should remove any kind of taper talk or volatility heading"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","54800","57120"," into next weekend."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","57120","61360"," It also opens the doors for the bulls to take this market higher."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","61360","69120"," But it might also make it a sell the news event heading into the next Friday's symposium."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","69120","72040"," So we are working on some deadlines here."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","72040","76960"," We've got a full economic calendar this week, we have OPEC's on Friday."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","76960","81840"," Then we have the symposium next weekend."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","81840","86800"," We also have to deal with the seasonality of the market selling off coming into September"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","86800","88400"," and October."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","88400","93840"," Moving on to ES, get this chart a little bit closer for you for the daily."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","93840","99120"," And you can't see it on this chart, but right here this is the Friday into the weekend gap"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","99120","101440"," that needed to get filled."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","101440","107720"," And so we came up and closed up here yesterday at New All Time Highs, 44, 76, 50."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","107720","113800"," And we sold off into the overnight to close this gap over here, which we wound up doing."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","113800","116960"," You'll also see these levels that I have in here."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","116960","127160"," You've got 44, 59, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 4, 3, 5, 0.25, 4, 4, 1, 6, 0.25 and the nice round number"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","127160","130160"," of 4400 down below."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","130160","134720"," Now you know that bears went short here into the close yesterday."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","134720","139840"," This is where this is the point right here when we come back to retest this today."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","139840","142560"," This will be where the bears hold the line."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","142560","149880"," If we break through this line, you're going to see another squeeze heading on up, okay?"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","149880","151720"," Be conscious of this."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","151720","159480"," Today in pre-market, in the beginning of the day, you're going to see the bears try to"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","159480","163680"," bust through these support lines that the bulls have."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","163680","171120"," These are our bulls' best friend today, and we can use these as a bull for weak attempts"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","171200","173360"," by the bears to try to break through."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","173360","178360"," If they try to break through once, twice, three times, we can grab that second or third"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","178360","180480"," and run it up, right?"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","180480","184720"," So be conscious of these support lines to play this afternoon."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","184720","187880"," There is a fair chance today that we do some more consolidation."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","187880","194880"," We work within a sideways trading pattern today, but you are looking for weakness for"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","194880","202480"," the four of the bulls at that 8.30, 10 a.m. and 1.30 or 1 p.m. timeframe today."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","202480","208840"," I think we even have a Fed guy talking at 3.30 or so that might bring some doom and gloom."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","208840","213440"," Also keep in mind that today's turnaround Tuesday, we were green yesterday, and with"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","213440","218320"," us being green, it is expected that today will be a down day."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","218320","222960"," It is important though that we do not give up these supports as the day moves forward"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","222960","227120"," because the bear's plan would be to break through these supports and take it down at"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","227120","228880"," least to 4400."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","228880","233400"," I think they'd be satisfied at this point with getting it this low, though I do find"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","233400","237160"," it hard to believe that they get this red today."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","237160","245160"," So look for either playing off these supports or wherever we wind up at by end of day going"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","245160","247600"," long into Wednesday and Thursday."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","247600","251760"," There is another issue and that would be I was looking at the options chains yesterday"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","251760","256400"," and there are a lot of calls out there still from yesterday."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","256400","262000"," The market maker is going to want to burn those calls today if they can and not print"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","262000","265840"," and pay the large amount of Friday puts that are out there."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","265840","270120"," So what they can do is they can kind of make us burn sideways."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","270120","275640"," That would kill your Wednesday options for the 18th and then they'll allow the market"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","275640","278480"," to move in the direction that it wants to go."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","278480","282880"," So my idea for today is that we're going to trade down a little bit and trade within"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","282880","283880"," a box."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","283880","289800"," There is though always the threat of trading down below that sideways movement on bad news"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","289800","294680"," or trading above on good news today, finding some strength at some point before the end"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","294680","295760"," of the day."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","295760","305680"," So my call for today would be no lower than 44, 35, 25 and no higher than 44, 76.50."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","305680","310760"," You can write some bet your own support lines on your charts today and play off these charts."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","310760","315440"," You're looking for failures to break through on two or three attempts to ride these to"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","315440","318640"," ride ES or spy right back up."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","318640","323480"," If we do get some strength if they let's let's say they get deep down in here today, if they"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","323480","331200"," get down deep to the 4400 or 4416, that is an area of value for bulls, you will see a"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","331200","333880"," strong reaction down at these levels."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","333880","339680"," And if we do get down here, I would expect a rip to all time highs once again."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","339680","345600"," Let's move on to NQ."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","345600","348640"," And nothing about NQ surprises me this week."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","348640","352600"," You had this nice dip down below yesterday on Monday."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","352600","356040"," We wrote it right back up to resistance above."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","356040","357040"," We don't really need."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","358040","363440"," I don't really think that the banks really care about NQ as much as exiting the positions"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","363440","365640"," over the next two to three weeks."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","365640","370760"," So they'll sell it down, bring it back up and sell down out of their positions that they"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","370760","372840"," have into September."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","372840","378600"," Now we've got OPEC's here on Friday the 20th and right where this right where this wedge"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","378600","382080"," ends is on the 27th of August."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","382080","387360"," This is this is exactly when that symposium in Wyoming begins."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","387360","393760"," So my expectation would be that we trade within this wedge pattern here over the coming weeks."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","393760","397840"," If you are long as a bull in this market and expect us to go higher, it's going to"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","397840","403360"," be a challenge because we have sellers hiding above these levels up in here, that sellers"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","403360","412920"," hiding here at 15, but right now it's at 15, 132, 15, 156 and 15, 155."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","412920","417960"," Is there a chance that we have a strong reaction as we get closer and maybe one day push much"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","417960","418960"," higher?"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","418960","419960"," Yes, we do."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","419960","428160"," I'm not anticipating though, NASDAQ to remain in string heading into this August 27th date."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","428160","433760"," This NASDAQ only needs to stay up long enough for bulls that have been involved in the"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","433760","441120"," spies since June 19th without a big payout to get those prints that they're looking for."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","441120","447280"," So if you're a theta trader or if you like the action of trading within a defined space,"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","447280","450440"," this is a pretty good place for you to be."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","450440","455480"," Moving on to RTY, the rut Russell."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","455480","465920"," Take a look at this one and yesterday I posted on Twitter saying that I didn't trust yesterday's"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","465920","472280"," recovery in the rut and there's a reason for that because there's a larger wedge at play"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","472280","477680"," in here and we did sell off yesterday and now we've got some fishing expedition heading"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","477680","478920"," even lower."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","478920","483620"," If you remember from my video, I'll let you know that these are two big, pretty big medium"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","483620","487100"," size support areas here for the rut."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","487100","491940"," I don't expect it to reclaim anything up in here or break any higher."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","491940","497220"," I do expect that on this larger wedge that we're going to trade down to the support of"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","497220","502540"," 2141 trade back up, maybe possibly into OPEC."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","502540","508780"," So let's say we trade down here into OPEC's on the 20th and then some new positions are"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","508780","515740"," taken to come back up here, here and in here that eventually fall off to September 15th"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","515740","518020"," or September 15th."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","518020","526340"," Now one area of concern is how deep do we sell off in IWM and the timing?"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","526340","534220"," I really do believe that we start to get really bearish and possibly pull it down to the 2100"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","534220","536860"," level or even slightly deeper."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","536860","541380"," We could possibly even see it come down to this 2000 heading all the way over to the"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","541380","542740"," 15th of September."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","542740","550140"," Now the thing to keep in mind is that I would expect the Russell to sell off sooner than"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","550140","555820"," NDX or excuse me, NQ or ES and recover sooner."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","555820","562180"," I think that it's going to take some time for the spy for NDX to completely take their"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","562180","566780"," cards off the table, give it like two months, September and October."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","566780","571580"," IWM on the other hand will gain strength sooner than those other two indexes."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","571580","578180"," So you want to be tracking these levels down here as we move into mid-September to get long"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","578180","580260"," once again."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","580260","585060"," Now this fishing expedition, I don't think that IWM actually burns."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","585060","587540"," You're going to see a strong reaction here."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","587540","594260"," This is a place for you to get long once again and play it up here to this same area"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","594260","596540"," of resistance above."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","596540","602220"," And there is a possibility that we trade sideways in IWM from now until let's call it Friday"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","602220","612220"," and then we do a steep sell off into the close on Friday down below to this 2143."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","612220","619860"," Tesla is showing some signs of recovery this morning."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","619860","628780"," Now the areas of value in Tesla are down below here at 663.30, 637.57."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","628780","633420"," Now there are trap buyers now stuck up inside of this area up in here, right?"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","633420","635900"," We've got longs that are trapped."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","635900","641140"," What normally I would say that in this area down here you'd let this sell off into Friday"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","641140","646300"," and grab new calls to make another run into next week."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","646300","651380"," We don't really have a lot of time between now and the 27th for Tesla."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","651380","654660"," Is it possible it gets extended into the beginning of September?"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","654660","655660"," Sure."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","655660","662140"," But we want to think about these trapped buyers up in here and what we need to push all the"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","662140","663860"," way up."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","663860","668300"," And what we need is some of these big banks and institutions or a giant whale maybe from"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","668300","673820"," Japan or something to step in and not really care about these hidden sellers because from"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","673820","683500"," now until Friday, anytime we come up to this 700 level 699.02 level or even up to this 720,"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","683500","688500"," let's call it just a flat 720, these buyers are going to want to exit."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","688500","691220"," They're going to tell you that they're going to want to stay long but they will do whatever"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","691220","694300"," they can to get out of these bad positions."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","694300","700860"," So hope for a whale to push us up to 740, 750 today, if that doesn't happen in the next"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","700860","707820"," couple days, we start trading sideways, the clock will be ticking for OPEC's on Friday"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","707820","709420"," to sell this down."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","709420","714300"," Now because it is OPEC's there is a chance that the whale will step in and push us much"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","714300","720180"," higher and take us to that 740 level but it is looking more and more like we have some"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","720180","725900"," weakness down to this 665 and possibly even 637 heading into Friday."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","725900","728340"," Good luck trading today all of you."
"lM-_DMEW3YY","728340","733500"," Find me on Twitter if you have any questions about where I'm at on the market right now"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","733500","739340"," and I hope you all make money today and I really hope that big buyers step in on Tesla"
"lM-_DMEW3YY","739340","739740"," today."
