"133590","134770"," Got some weirdness going on. "
"137470","139550"," Straight hairs or something like that."
"141210","143630"," Okay, so let's get started together here."
"143770","151490"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up to the tick.com."
"151730","158950"," Looks like we got bought with the mark up on the low down here in the overnight somewhere. "
"161390","163610"," Not to be not unexpected either."
"164390","166550"," We have some stuff to talk about this morning."
"167950","170430"," I got a couple things we got to do. "
"171350","175470"," We got to make sure the Russian trolls don't come in at some point today."
"178330","179630"," A couple things."
"180430","183090"," Every day it's like they could make this stuff simple. "
"183090","187030"," But they don't like all comments."
"187030","188170"," No, not all comments."
"189250","190210"," Sort by newest. "
"192850","194490"," We have some stuff to talk about today."
"194590","195110"," Some cool stuff."
"197090","198690"," We've got a problem. "
"198870","200470"," If I can get to it today."
"200770","203210"," We do need to be diligent on risk management."
"203530","209810"," If I can get to it today, we're going to talk about risk management with banks. "
"211950","213030"," Good morning, everybody."
"213110","213930"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"214330","215590"," We have some stuff to talk about."
"215710","216890"," We're going to talk about a role. "
"217290","219050"," If there is a role, how bad is it?"
"220170","224750"," When do you expect it every month in normalizing markets with low vol?"
"225070","228350"," It's on whether unemployment must rise to cut CPI."
"229450","237830"," I saw a fish and market hype on Twitter this morning posted about us being in a low vol situation."
"237830","241090"," Just heads up on open 924. "
"242110","246570"," I'm going to expect that we go down here and clear up some of these gaps that we have down"
"246570","246810"," below."
"248510","249830"," Though it's not required."
"251310","257070"," If we're going up into a close, we usually close the upside too, so that's possible as well. "
"257690","259130"," Personally, I'd like to see us close."
"260050","262450"," This gap down below, we've got some previous lows."
"262890","266170"," We can tag those right now and I'll give you some levels here in a moment. "
"267170","269250"," There's a previous low from the overnight."
"269410","271970"," I haven't checked the yes yet to see where that line is."
"272030","275470"," I'm assuming it's slightly lower down in here. "
"276730","279050"," I'll take a look at that at some point this morning."
"280010","282490"," We also have hidden in this yellow box."
"282650","284610"," I'll get rid of this yellow box real quick for you too. "
"286430","288630"," This is just your weekly expected range."
"289250","290290"," We talked about this yesterday."
"291610","293870"," There's some previous low stuff down here. "
"293870","296610"," You can see it back here if you're a bear and you're looking for new lows."
"296770","297650"," That's down there."
"297650","301750"," If there were to be a serious global financial event and markets froze. "
"303630","308210"," Yeah, this is going to be the talk that's going to be talked about by bears nonstop garbage"
"308210","308710"," talking."
"310290","311690"," It's going to be nonstop."
"312290","315010"," The official market hype though, this morning made a very good point. "
"315190","320070"," We've talked about this in our program, which is we're in a low-ball environment."
"321650","323970"," We're in a normalized market environment."
"324190","327990"," Thank you, England's bill says I see a high U.K. neutral rate of unemployment. "
"328990","330030"," You can't deny it."
"330150","335970"," You can try to deny it, but I can assure you that since last May, believe it or not, we"
"335970","337710"," began to not normalize markets."
"338030","338730"," The steps began. "
"339150","340550"," We started in May of last year."
"340710","345590"," We continued on in June and then by October, we had a normalized market."
"345590","351710"," And it's been like that ever since this can't be denied. "
"351970","353310"," There's nothing that you can say now."
"353490","360770"," You can say there have been still some silent business cycle rotation events."
"360770","367470"," You saw it with oil so they can switch some of this up so I can get some of this"
"367470","368210"," done for you here. "
"369010","378450"," You can say here's your pivot line right here, 409.22. You could say the"
"378450","380930"," silent bear market continued."
"381210","384790"," It's really not like the silent bear market."
"384910","388230"," I guess you called it bear market continued, but it really didn't. "
"388270","389190"," It was more cycles."
"389670","397290"," If you watch business cycles, you know that it was expected for oil to go down then financials to"
"397290","398270"," go down that kind of stuff."
"399170","403350"," Though that's all it's not like we made that should people made that shit up out of the blue. "
"408190","410110"," So there's nothing you can say about that."
"410590","414090"," I do want you to notice this morning that we have some range expansion."
"417090","418050"," Ahead for us. "
"418050","420070"," 406 unlike yesterday."
"424370","425410"," 406 27."
"429140","431020"," We usually see this after minutes. "
"432020","435300"," We usually see this after a fed event stuff like that."
"435460","437720"," It's a nice supply above by the way in the open this morning."
"437900","438340"," You can see it. "
"441040","443560"," We've had some normalization of markets and."
"445400","446860"," It was interesting because efficient."
"446860","449820"," I didn't comment on efficient market hypes post this morning. "
"449820","450620"," I should have."
"451460","458120"," Because what he didn't show you was that the he's I think you talked about November of."
"458240","460000"," I believe I can be wrong in this, but I believe. "
"461080","464040"," He pointed towards November of."
"465420","465900"," 2021."
"466880","469120"," Don't hold me to that, but that's what I think that he did. "
"469920","474160"," And well, when he didn't show you was April, May of 2021."
"475200","476600"," And or 2020."
"477720","482800"," And well, excuse me, March, April of 2020, 2021. "
"484980","485740"," 2020."
"486640","489940"," And most March, April's historically."
"491160","492800"," I think he showed November. "
"493240","494560"," I could be wrong."
"494880","497000"," It could be September October or September November."
"497220","499180"," Excuse me, October, November, he showed. "
"499500","502600"," But what he didn't show was seasonally."
"504020","506880"," And seasonally, we're kind of doing what we normally do."
"509560","510120"," Excuse me. "
"512140","513419"," So just on that topic."
"517610","520110"," Couple more headlines down was a whole bunch of them down here."
"520210","521049"," There's a gap right here. "
"523970","525470"," There's the beginning of the gap down."
"525850","526350"," Wait a minute."
"526810","527670"," What's going on here?"
"538200","539120"," Hello, one second here. "
"542680","543080"," Alexa."
"544160","544280"," Shush."
"544280","547240"," Just a bit of market commentary here. "
"547360","550500"," So for options package targets, I said, pause by June policy."
"550500","553040"," Get a weird, get some weirdness going on in here."
"553180","554680"," Twenty, twenty three options. "
"555020","556740"," And a frozen screen package."
"556980","557500"," Very unusual."
"557820","562320"," In policy rates between approximately four spot eight, seven, five percent, two, four spot, nine,"
"562500","563640"," three, seven, five percent. "
"564140","568640"," I need to benefit from a may rate hike and a pause of following policy meeting in June."
"574010","575650"," So again, reset this again."
"576430","577930"," There we go. "
"577970","582190"," I'm considering a twenty five and fifty basis point rate hike options for me and says, underlying"
"582190","584170"," inflation moving in the wrong direction."
"588820","594220"," So we'll talk about, we'll talk about the low vol situation that we're in right now."
"594720","601820"," And we'll talk about when the role, if we have normalized markets in a low volatility environment,"
"603040","608020"," I guess if you're looking for this nothing towards nothing negative towards anybody out there at"
"608020","608160"," all. "
"608160","615980"," But even if we're in a low volatility environment, it's kind of like you're cute to be like, okay,"
"616020","617300"," I'm going to roll out the bear."
"619820","622760"," The bear thesis right now, because you're going to expect."
"624060","626240"," Your dollar rise is twenty one year high. "
"627260","630920"," Normalized environment for the market to roll over into the 18th and 20th."
"631180","636900"," Now, of course, I know you guys know a lot of bears out there that have been, they say this"
"636900","637600"," shit every day."
"638540","640940"," They say it every day nonstop garbage. "
"641260","642580"," They've been saying it every day."
"643400","644040"," Every day."
"645620","646480"," Every day. "
"647820","650060"," We're almost on an anniversary of a year."
"652360","654160"," Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash."
"654700","655840"," You know, we're at risk of crash. "
"656140","656460"," That's fine."
"656660","659920"," But when you're doing it every fucking day, there's a reason for it."
"660240","661020"," It's fees. "
"661760","662240"," It's subscriptions."
"664740","667620"," It's maybe you're just a negative person constantly."
"667620","669340"," You know, all aspects of your life. "
"669860","676960"," But a lot of it has to do with followers needing to gain followers constantly churn."
"677360","679220"," They call it churn in the business."
"680200","682100"," If you're trying to sell subs. "
"683380","684840"," Or gain followers."
"685620","686360"," It's called churn."
"687940","693340"," You what you do is you post counter to what everybody wants. "
"694740","698980"," Or you post controversial things or you post."
"699160","703820"," I've actually run those posts on my Twitter to find out how real that is."
"704400","706780"," Many times I've actually run different. "
"708180","710180"," On my own Twitter, I've run different."
"713100","718720"," Different programs like I'll say I'm going to run this for a week or a few days or a month"
"718720","719380"," or something."
"719380","723300"," I'm going to do something reoccurring to see what the reaction or response is. "
"723300","724260"," Who have you pissed off?"
"725220","726640"," How much you've pissed people off."
"726800","729100"," I've actually had a conversation briefly with."
"729940","734780"," I met someone on fintuit that was angry with me. "
"736340","737940"," Like publicly so."
"739200","744520"," And I got some of these people I'll go and check their profiles to see who they are."
"744660","745380"," I'll check to see. "
"746520","747180"," If they."
"748380","749820"," If they contribute to."
"750580","753260"," Well, if they feel like it's there on Twitter and you're like, I hate you. "
"753340","755560"," I hate you or whatever."
"756640","759940"," But you then you go to their profile and you find out that they're just the troll."
"760140","760740"," All they do. "
"760860","763040"," They don't really ever add anything ever."
"765260","765660"," Anything."
"766160","766800"," It's just like. "
"767020","767500"," It's all."
"767700","767960"," It's either."
"768220","769380"," It's either the retweets. "
"770280","771540"," Or no posts."
"772200","778340"," And then their comments are typically raging on people like inside of post other people make."
"779120","781320"," And so that's kind of like trollish behavior. "
"782280","785100"," So those people you just kind of like, yeah, I'm going to block that person or whatever."
"785760","787280"," They're all mute that person."
"787380","787960"," That's the big one. "
"788560","790160"," You mute that person up."
"790320","792340"," They rage in your tweets and your comments."
"793680","795320"," Typically I'll just mute them. "
"796100","798340"," And what happens is they rage it."
"798480","801760"," They just scream into the night and don't know that you've muted them."
"802280","802780"," Now. "
"804080","810260"," If they if they see your comment, your post and they repost your post somewhere raging."
"811140","812480"," Believe it or not."
"813380","818320"," Most of these people don't realize that you are they're helping you to get more followers. "
"818880","820380"," So they're giving you traction."
"820900","825100"," If you post something that emotionally sets people off."
"826160","832000"," And so you're actually helping people with without knowing it, you're helping people to get more"
"832000","832480"," followers. "
"833900","836040"," One second here are one four eleven."
"839180","841960"," So those people typically I'll leave them alone."
"841960","846860"," I'll be like, yeah, we'll just let those people do that because I'm going to get followers from"
"846860","847100"," that. "
"847100","853320"," I don't know if you know that or not, but that is what oftentimes there's some other things people"
"853320","853640"," do."
"853800","855300"," What they'll do is they'll follow you."
"856420","857800"," And wait, interact. "
"858040","861920"," They'll follow you and see if you'll follow them back when they dump you as a follow person that"
"861920","862340"," they follow."
"862720","864620"," Another thing that people do is they'll follow you."
"864700","867560"," Wait, if you don't follow them, they'll interact with you until you do. "
"868120","870480"," And then they'll dump you as a follow as well."
"870660","872320"," There's a bunch of different shit that these people do."
"872860","874080"," We're thirteen ninety five. "
"874360","876380"," I do some form of that."
"876520","877460"," I will follow people."
"878480","884240"," If they follow me, they're posting stuff that I think is like, yeah, I can use this or something. "
"884360","885460"," I'll continue to follow them."
"885560","889300"," They start posting stuff that doesn't tell me to make money."
"889920","891280"," That's why I'm on Twitter. "
"892200","893160"," To make money."
"893580","894420"," You should be on Twitter."
"894740","895520"," Well, that should be. "
"895640","900100"," But if you are in the market, likely you're on Twitter to make money."
"900660","902080"," That is the reason why."
"902820","903220"," Hopefully. "
"903760","905580"," Well, hopefully, because if not, you should be out."
"905660","908220"," You should be outside doing something or reading a book or trying to."
"909020","909860"," Get late or something. "
"909980","911240"," Whatever it is that you do in your life."
"911780","912720"," Then be on Twitter."
"914200","917400"," Now, this is that's really relates to finance Twitter. "
"917940","919400"," And specifically, I guess."
"924340","927740"," Some of you are like, I'm only there for the laws or I'm only there for that."
"927940","928340"," I get to. "
"929580","931640"," But if you see someone out there that's like."
"932300","934260"," On finance Twitter, generally speaking."
"934980","937260"," You didn't find it because you were looking for the laws. "
"937280","939460"," You find it because you're like, yeah, I need some."
"940100","941120"," Alpha or something."
"942340","944920"," I don't bounce my ideas off of a word or whatever. "
"947990","948430"," 401."
"948970","949170"," 54."
"950090","950290"," 56. "
"952010","956830"," Now, my point behind this is oftentimes, I guess, ultimately, I'm trying to come back to is that."
"957470","959830"," You constantly see people saying we're going to crash."
"960130","960530"," We're going to crash. "
"960610","961130"," We're going to crash."
"961850","962730"," We're going to roll over."
"962730","963770"," We're going to go to the depths of hell. "
"964610","967730"," And man, 99% of that is bullshit."
"968550","969690"," Not only is it bullshit."
"972190","973790"," We have some good range expansion this far. "
"973850","974550"," I'm pretty happy with this."
"974690","975250"," This is good to see."
"975590","977570"," So you can see that we're starting now. "
"977750","978630"," Just looking off you."
"978770","980830"," If you every morning, let's see, you go get your levels for me."
"982290","983330"," I post them for free. "
"983630","984730"," People charge for this."
"985070","985550"," Just levels."
"985890","987270"," People charge five, 10 bucks a month. "
"987410","987890"," They show you not."
"988490","989650"," And every morning you get your levels."
"989650","993310"," I post this every morning on that captain's alpha. "
"994390","996010"," Most mornings, 90% of the time."
"996270","998090"," Every once in a rare moment, I don't."
"998250","1001450"," But we're talking like, if you look at this whole year, I think I've done it. "
"1001690","1003070"," I think I've maybe missed once or twice."
"1004690","1006990"," So you can just see opening up this morning."
"1008050","1011250"," That our expected move from yesterday has come down, right?"
"1011870","1013890"," So this is your first thing that you want to be looking at. "
"1014010","1017770"," So when role, we're going to start with when role, then we'll get into Elon and all other shit."
"1018530","1019750"," So just this morning."
"1020750","1026910"," If you looked at yesterday's levels and you look at today's levels, the implied move is lower. "
"1027650","1032210"," What is that telling you is telling you previous lows that we have in the past, right?"
"1032790","1036750"," The expectation is that we're going to trade lower, right?"
"1037530","1040690"," We didn't get range expansion of the upside."
"1040950","1042369"," We got range expansion to the downside."
"1043650","1044910"," That's your first clue. "
"1045589","1046069"," Right?"
"1046250","1050010"," We have limited upside probability, like probability, right?"
"1050230","1051810"," How probable is that we're going higher?"
"1052330","1054290"," Not as probable as it was yesterday."
"1054310","1056050"," Or yesterday we had a tight range, right?"
"1056290","1060750"," Remember yesterday and yesterday's famous that you, at some point today, this is going to get sold"
"1060750","1061730"," after the event."
"1061930","1064810"," We don't have a lot of upside or even downside. "
"1067130","1069030"," Probability should be a muted minutes."
"1069890","1071910"," And you should see sellers step in."
"1071910","1078330"," And we had already hit the low side target and the upside target, but not in cash market earlier in"
"1078330","1079390"," the day yesterday. "
"1080330","1083110"," And you can actually see we got bought this morning, right?"
"1083270","1085690"," We got bought that you couldn't chase the whole last night."
"1086010","1087370"," There wasn't a lot of range expected."
"1089090","1090510"," This isn't rocket science. "
"1090730","1093670"," This is all previous levels of support and resistance."
"1095150","1098710"," Coupled with the implied move each day in the options market."
"1100870","1105910"," So you can figure this out to, to some extent, on your own. "
"1106570","1112290"," If you have your support and resistance levels every day, you can see how range expands and"
"1112290","1115490"," contracts day in, day out in an implied move."
"1116210","1122810"," Coupled with that should give you some reference or idea as to where we should trade that day."
"1122910","1130130"," Now watch me say that. "
"1130770","1135590"," Every like 10, 20% to be like 10 sessions, you'll get a move like that."
"1136090","1138250"," But not the other seven to eight, right?"
"1138390","1142870"," The other seven or eight, you can kind of expect us to trade within a range and you can get"
"1142870","1144110"," a fair painting."
"1144850","1148210"," Are we going to make big moves today or a little moves today?"
"1150850","1151290"," Right. "
"1151430","1153350"," How big of the move that we're going to get today."
"1153350","1155210"," She's just repeat the last headline."
"1155370","1158350"," So I'm seeing a smaller rise in unemployment. "
"1166960","1169560"," And so I get my levels every single day, right?"
"1169940","1171600"," I got my pivot points every day."
"1172400","1178020"," Then I go back through and I start to look for previous lows and previous highs to the tick."
"1178760","1179560"," So I got my levels. "
"1179800","1185240"," Then I'm like, yeah, I'm looking for some places to actually look for real support and resistance."
"1185240","1188940"," So when I come down and ask one or S two and I want to the tick."
"1190300","1191720"," Strike to be looking for. "
"1191940","1196080"," I'm going to be looking for the exact previous high and lows in each ticker."
"1196080","1199860"," It could be spy, SPX, ES, whatever it is."
"1200240","1203300"," Often times specifically relating to the S and P 500. "
"1203620","1203860"," Thank you."
"1203880","1204680"," England's pill again."
"1204820","1208120"," Did you say you pick companies likely to hold workers in a slump. "
"1208480","1210000"," I think a smaller rise in unemployment."
"1212100","1214520"," Often times in the S and P 500."
"1216260","1219570"," You'll see you'll say, well, I'm trading the spy or I'm trading SPX. "
"1220300","1221180"," Or I'm trading ES."
"1221760","1222760"," Doesn't matter what you're trading."
"1223620","1225600"," And you'll be like, why did we stop on this tick?"
"1225880","1227500"," This is a positive demonstrable. "
"1227620","1228500"," It may be emerging."
"1230480","1233140"," You'll say to yourself, why didn't we hit this exact tick?"
"1234780","1236120"," Why did we go a little bit below?"
"1236420","1237200"," Why did we go a little bit above?"
"1238020","1243880"," Often times that is due to one of the other products within S and P 500."
"1243880","1247560"," Having an extreme range that is not on the one that you're trading. "
"1247800","1248240"," So IE."
"1248960","1252420"," If I'm trading the S and P for the spy right now and we had a low."
"1252980","1254460"," In the overnight hours. "
"1255060","1257340"," That's not showing up in pre market on spy."
"1257620","1261860"," We trade there during the day and I'm like, well, I don't know where that where that coming from."
"1262320","1264240"," Often times because of another product. "
"1265640","1267580"," Inside the S and P 500 complex."
"1269080","1272360"," So though I'm writing some of these previous highs previous lows."
"1272360","1274560"," I call him H line Jason Hendrix lines, right?"
"1275540","1280640"," He's a longtime member of the community, a moderator as well. "
"1280640","1282140"," And he's always looking for these."
"1282680","1287780"," He's always looking for previous highs and I'm not showing you all of these right now, but see if I"
"1287780","1288400"," can show them to you."
"1298880","1301760"," So just right here the past two days, right?"
"1301760","1305420"," I'll bring the triggers over in the implied move over here in just a moment for you. "
"1305540","1308020"," I'll change these out for what today's implied move is."
"1311120","1312920"," I'll get rid of some of these for right now."
"1312920","1314760"," They're mostly useful for you. "
"1314840","1315320"," Oh, shit."
"1315480","1316840"," I got rid of the daily trigger."
"1317280","1318120"," All right, fuck it. "
"1318120","1318760"," We'll do that one again."
"1319040","1320180"," I think it's much lower."
"1321480","1322140"," Maybe not. "
"1322340","1323740"," Maybe it's just not showing up on this chart."
"1325740","1328820"," So just for how I trade my or pick up my day, right?"
"1328980","1330180"," Like, what am I doing today?"
"1330900","1332480"," I'm looking for previous highs."
"1332860","1336940"," I already know that the range is like we're likely stepping down. "
"1337280","1338380"," Oh, I know a few things."
"1338560","1340960"," I know that we have normalized markets with low vol."
"1341340","1344840"," I know that we're coming into the third week of the month, right?"
"1344980","1349580"," Which means if we are in that environment, we're likely going to see some down into the 18th, 19th,"
"1349720","1350640"," 20th somewhere in there. "
"1351560","1353280"," We're likely going to see that."
"1354180","1356380"," And then I'm going to look for a previous high, right?"
"1356620","1358020"," We got some previous highs from yesterday."
"1358480","1360740"," We got one right here and one back here. "
"1360860","1362940"," We still haven't returned to this scene of the crime."
"1363420","1364080"," Expect this."
"1364260","1366320"," Believe it or not to us to return to this. "
"1366460","1374020"," I think on Friday, the way the options market was, um, was, uh, uh, was implied yesterday."
"1374520","1375660"," We'll return to this on Friday."
"1375980","1377560"," That's my view is that we'll return to this. "
"1377840","1381000"," We didn't sell off and trade and sell down on the hole in the overnight."
"1381200","1382320"," All that stuff means something."
"1383220","1385280"," And I've got these previous lows back here. "
"1386480","1386920"," Right."
"1386920","1391400"," So I don't know if I did these down here, but there are some previous lows back here."
"1392020","1394280"," So next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the spy. "
"1395200","1398280"," Then I'm going to look at the implied move for just today."
"1398380","1399240"," I'm day trading, right?"
"1399400","1401440"," That's what we're doing here on the high."
"1401640","1403060"," We've got four 11 on the low. "
"1403180","1404640"," We've got four, seven, 72."
"1405840","1407940"," So four, seven, 72 down here."
"1415040","1415760"," Down below. "
"1418500","1419740"," Make sure to get this right here."
"1421280","1423100"," Four, 13, four, seven, 72."
"1427440","1428480"," It's pretty high, right?"
"1428740","1429660"," Four, seven, 72. "
"1430640","1431640"," This is kind of counter."
"1432500","1434360"," See how high that is kind of counter."
"1435260","1437840"," To, to what all this is saying, right?"
"1438080","1441560"," My support and resistance levels are saying, now we're not going down, but look at this. "
"1441780","1443000"," This is saying this is the low."
"1443740","1445780"," Don't expect anything lower than this today."
"1445780","1448280"," Do you expect to fill this gap today?"
"1448480","1449760"," It's saying that's all it's saying. "
"1450240","1451260"," Expect to fill this gap."
"1451300","1454100"," It's all the market is saying this morning as we open."
"1454600","1460140"," Four, 10, 75 is what the implied move is on the upside. "
"1460440","1461820"," Four, 10, 75."
"1463500","1465300"," So not a whole ton of movement, right?"
"1474820","1476280"," At least the implied move."
"1476560","1480240"," We can trade outside of this, but that's not that big of a range, is it?"
"1480400","1481540"," That range is pretty small. "
"1482420","1489860"," I mean, this, this, this as a, do you do any of you out there coming into today's day?"
"1490320","1492520"," Are you expecting this to be the range today?"
"1493040","1493520"," I wasn't."
"1494300","1497760"," I was expecting we'd have a down day today or even open on a low."
"1497980","1500200"," I was hoping for a low, so I could grab some calls. "
"1501120","1504360"," I will actually per calls for this into Friday and we didn't get that today."
"1505180","1509340"," And they're telling out the market right now is telling us not to expect too much today."
"1511540","1517220"," So all these things are, all these things are giving me hints as to what the day holds in store"
"1517220","1517760"," for me. "
"1518420","1520440"," Now this is surprising as well."
"1521740","1523800"," I'm going to show you this here in just a moment."
"1525300","1528460"," We are sitting right on the daily trigger right here. "
"1530890","1532250"," Like we are right on it."
"1532870","1534130"," Excuse me, the hourly trigger."
"1535510","1540830"," So we're sitting right on the hourly trigger and this deduce it or gives us some more information. "
"1541290","1543190"," I'm going to show this to you on another chart here."
"1545310","1547650"," And you can see that we're sitting right now."
"1547730","1548250"," This is the spy. "
"1548470","1553150"," We're sitting on a three trigger, a three trigger cluster."
"1553530","1554810"," These are very emotional."
"1555290","1559750"," We usually get violent moves out of these clusters to the upward downside. "
"1560970","1564750"," And you can see right now in the spy that we are coiling, right?"
"1564950","1569850"," You can see that we have coiling happening for a pretty big move to come."
"1570570","1572710"," And I'm like, what is this going to be?"
"1573470","1575910"," So we're opening the morning, right?"
"1576230","1580230"," We're going to have to pick a direction or we're going to have to let the market open up and"
"1580230","1581850"," tell us which way that direction is."
"1582170","1585250"," I'm going to take a look here at the VIX. "
"1588370","1592610"," And the VIX is telling me the move is down off the opening bell this morning."
"1594210","1597690"," So far the VIX is telling me, yeah, you can expect at least a minimum cap."
"1598730","1602950"," The VIX is going to come up and likely even up here. "
"1603210","1608890"," And we already know the implied move today is to fill that gap down below."
"1610190","1611450"," That's what it's showing us, right?"
"1611570","1616010"," At least it's kind of kind of infer what all this means."
"1616810","1621010"," We use this line down here to say the bears are going to buy this, bears are going to buy"
"1621010","1621290"," that. "
"1621810","1624450"," We know that we can also go up here, right?"
"1625650","1628110"," Price right now is above the one minute."
"1628410","1631070"," But if the price comes down, we could go up, right?"
"1631490","1633950"," This is kind of showing me a range for the day, isn't it?"
"1634230","1635710"," Kind of a tight range in here."
"1641420","1642800"," So am I going to trade this?"
"1642980","1643680"," Probably not. "
"1644000","1645960"," On the opening bell, probably not."
"1646300","1651220"," If anything, where we are right now, I would probably prefer to trade."
"1652400","1658340"," I'd probably prefer to wait and let it go up here so I can take a long, right?"
"1658340","1662300"," On spy or come down here, right?"
"1662740","1665340"," And then take a short on the spy, right?"
"1666120","1666760"," Does that make sense?"
"1666960","1668860"," This would be the opposite of the spy, right?"
"1668980","1670640"," It's kind of in the middle of the road right now. "
"1671100","1673280"," It's not really providing me with enough information."
"1673780","1675960"," But it is showing me kind of a tight range right now."
"1679950","1681170"," So I'm already looking at this. "
"1681390","1681990"," I'm looking at the VIX."
"1682230","1682770"," I'm looking at the spy."
"1683070","1684050"," I'm looking at the implied move. "
"1684830","1686190"," And it's kind of showing me."
"1687370","1688850"," Don't expect too much today."
"1688850","1693930"," And if we're right in the middle of this range here, it's probably better for me to buy a dip"
"1693930","1698150"," down here or to sell up here. "
"1698150","1702770"," To let this open up and breathe a little bit, show me a direction higher, show me a direction"
"1702770","1707090"," lower, and then I'll pick the bottom or the top to sell or buy."
"1707310","1707770"," Does that make sense?"
"1711220","1717140"," Another way to look at this would be to keep VIX open on another screener and VIX will show you"
"1717140","1719780"," the way if price stays below the one minute."
"1721000","1726400"," And another way to look would be to be tracking the one in five minutes to look for bear and"
"1726400","1726980"," bull crosses. "
"1727160","1731000"," Otherwise, what you're doing in here is you're taking a guess."
"1731320","1731900"," Does that make sense?"
"1732300","1739240"," So if you're out there like, hey, I took a call and in like, hey, I'm long right now, likely"
"1739240","1747000"," right now on this open with what we've seen so far, what you're doing is you're taking a full-on"
"1747000","1747280"," gamble."
"1747280","1751920"," You have nothing really to tell you, hey, I should take this long here. "
"1752100","1758040"," If anything, the higher probability trade would be to wait to see if we go to the downside and then"
"1758040","1764960"," buying a dip or wait for us to go to the upside and then selling on the implied move."
"1765100","1765620"," Does that make sense?"
"1766200","1772240"," So the higher probability trade is taking this one or taking this one down here."
"1772240","1778480"," Off this open, you might come into the comment section and be like, or my chat and be like, whew,"
"1778540","1779940"," I was long and made all this money. "
"1781080","1784820"," But how you came to that decision likely was flawed."
"1787940","1790000"," Probability wise, it was flawed."
"1790560","1791100"," Does that make sense?"
"1800300","1810130"," Now, with all of that said, we're going to add some more layers to this. "
"1812090","1813350"," And what do I see here?"
"1815030","1821610"," I remember yesterday that we had a hundred and six, thirty thousand, four, twelve C's."
"1822550","1824210"," All those people sold this morning."
"1825050","1825870"," That was good to see. "
"1826030","1827550"," They were long into the belly yesterday."
"1828010","1828650"," Those people are gone."
"1829250","1830510"," Whoever they are, those are robots. "
"1832370","1834350"," This morning we've got right off the opening bell."
"1835090","1839430"," Fifty seven thousand, four, ten C's."
"1839810","1844890"," They're betting on a move higher on the open this morning with that people. "
"1844890","1848310"," These are actually algorithms and dealers."
"1849050","1850410"," We also have another batch."
"1851150","1855810"," We have another fourteen thousand, four, ten C buyers on four, ten C."
"1857450","1861030"," So that's giving us some more information that somebody knows we're going up. "
"1861670","1865450"," Somebody or somebody thinks we're going up or they're trying to hold the market up with it."
"1865590","1871930"," They think we're going to go up there or they're hedging to an upside move, right?"
"1872090","1874550"," It's just a hedge to an upside move."
"1874750","1876770"," They actually don't care if we go up. "
"1877390","1879950"," It might be positioned short right now."
"1880550","1888010"," And it's cheaper for them to hedge to the upside of position with dirt cheap calls while they're"
"1888010","1888930"," short this market."
"1891030","1896450"," So right now, for me, if I was thinking about taking a call or a put right now, I would"
"1896450","1901750"," probably, this is oftentimes why I come on late in the morning, is because I don't want to be here"
"1901750","1908150"," for the first half an hour, first forty five minutes, first twenty minutes, and making a decision"
"1908150","1911610"," with you on air saying, yeah, we should take calls here, take puts here. "
"1912290","1918170"," If anything, probably the best trade today, if I had to guess right off the open right now, if I"
"1918170","1923390"," had to guess the best trade today is likely high probability going to be a fly."
"1924130","1931230"," Wide wide wide wide fly can capture all this move today because there isn't really that much of an"
"1931230","1931870"," implied move."
"1932290","1937570"," And if anything, I'd probably make it as this shows here, right?"
"1937750","1941970"," Probably make it outside of this R3 and then way way down here below this S3. "
"1943070","1947310"," There isn't much expectation today for an outsized move."
"1947570","1951570"," The options market's not telling me there's one already triggers telling me that there's one."
"1952530","1960630"," But the, but the, excuse me, the, or the, the early triggers telling me is going to be an outsized"
"1960630","1962910"," move, but the options market is not telling me that. "
"1966120","1974040"," And to, and to that point into tomorrow, we have not hit the weekly upside expected move."
"1974440","1977860"," This week's implied move, we have not hit the upside expected move."
"1979580","1981160"," So, let me see one more thing here. "
"1982920","1986740"," 40294 and way over here, I'm going to show you this."
"1990240","1991960"," There it is right there."
"1994080","1996500"," 40294, the daily trigger has actually moved up. "
"1998540","2002600"," This is not the daily trigger anymore, the daily trigger is higher."
"2003420","2005120"," The daily trigger has actually moved up from yesterday."
"2006100","2012200"," The market has become more supportive, even though you may not be able to see it. "
"2012420","2013760"," Yeah, there's the daily trigger right there."
"2018200","2023450"," 39294, it's actually come up above S3."
"2023990","2026770"," Bears would like nothing more than to get under this. "
"2026990","2028090"," Get down to this S3."
"2028490","2030910"," Bears would love nothing more to get down here."
"2031630","2032530"," Maybe you can't see this. "
"2035680","2039920"," Bears would like nothing more with this daily trigger coming up to just blast down here, get"
"2039920","2041520"," underneath this daily trigger."
"2042200","2043720"," This is where the blood starts for bears."
"2043720","2047380"," Is anything underneath that daily trigger?"
"2047659","2053179"," Basically, for bulls, bulls have been chasing this for a long period of time. "
"2053480","2057760"," All bull wants is to buy this daily trigger down here."
"2068280","2068920"," Just a second here."
"2077670","2080770"," Yeah, early looks strong and the daily looks weak right now. "
"2088010","2088530"," 414."
"2090110","2100030"," 412 is the upper range expectation where tomorrow is 412, 13, and 406 to the downside tomorrow."
"2100850","2104650"," We have a lot of work to get up here into tomorrow. "
"2104950","2106250"," A lot of work to get up here."
"2106330","2109290"," We hit this yesterday in pre-market."
"2110070","2116930"," Just seeing that sitting there like that in pre-market, that bull shit right there. "
"2119590","2121170"," Let's mean to believe that's going to happen."
"2127160","2128720"," Try to pull that bull shit."
"2131540","2133160"," We had this happen in December. "
"2133540","2138060"," I'm sure there's bears out there that are like, oh, last time we did that, it was just, it was"
"2138060","2139540"," a straight trip to hell."
"2149830","2151290"," We teed off and that was it."
"2151370","2152010"," We never came back. "
"2155770","2157170"," This time it is different."
"2158650","2159810"," It is different."
"2159810","2160310"," It's spring. "
"2162110","2166050"," If this was the weakest month of the year, it'd say, yeah, you're probably right."
"2167470","2174170"," And this is the strongest time period of the year coming into an ER season and say, I doubt that."
"2175630","2176790"," I doubt that highly. "
"2184240","2185700"," All right, hold on a second here."
"2189100","2193320"," Effective funds rate unchanged for this morning."
"2203720","2208480"," OPEC is saying any economic weakness from rate hikes could weigh on the U.S. summer fuel demand. "
"2208760","2212660"," We see the demand outlook for OECD."
"2212960","2214080"," Europe remaining is challenged."
"2220110","2224370"," The most recent U.S. inflation report provided support for bond bulls and bears both. "
"2225070","2228170"," Core prices increased somewhat while the headline figures decreased year over year."
"2228170","2232610"," Even if traders increased their bets at the federal lower interest rates at a faster clip than"
"2232610","2237970"," expected earlier in the week, swaps markets still support a quarter point raise by the Fed in May."
"2238270","2240630"," I don't think anyone expects a rate cut. "
"2241270","2250450"," I think that traders expect a pause this year and with a trade into pause discussion into the"
"2250450","2258150"," minutes yesterday and then, of course, rate increases throughout the rest of the year."
"2259050","2261170"," But pause definitely being a part of it."
"2261490","2262810"," And that did happen yesterday. "
"2263290","2267850"," That yesterday they did say that we should have a fed rate increase in May."
"2268670","2273730"," And I think it was one of the banks, I forget which one, maybe as GS said, they don't expect"
"2273730","2274910"," a rate hike in June."
"2274910","2277530"," The Treasury investors are setting up for a slow grinding rally. "
"2277930","2282550"," The bond investors are lacking in their treasury allocation so that they can add the potential for"
"2282550","2286030"," continued rallies or should they to continue to surprise for the downside."
"2292360","2293420"," Let's see anything else."
"2324080","2325560"," Claims was good to see. "
"2326780","2328300"," Good numbers this morning."
"2343670","2344930"," Core PPI was good."
"2345890","2347070"," PPI year over year was good. "
"2351120","2352080"," How y'all doing this morning?"
"2357920","2358520"," Ross walks."
"2359040","2359460"," Hold on a second."
"2359900","2361840"," If you want to, we'll kind of link you want to see, man. "
"2362140","2363020"," So I wasn't reading the chat."
"2363120","2363520"," Hold on here."
"2363900","2365620"," I'm going to catch up with you guys in the chat right now. "
"2381340","2383900"," Let me go over to the chats here and see what's going on here."
"2385000","2385920"," What am I doing here?"
"2390660","2393180"," Get some stuff to do here."
"2399230","2400830"," Some of your chat I can see right now. "
"2400910","2402110"," Some of the chat I can't see."
"2402590","2403290"," Here we go."
"2405270","2407410"," Let me go through some of the ego you guys are saying this morning. "
"2410630","2413030"," It's getting ground to dust today, huh?"
"2413410","2413670"," Look at that."
"2414050","2416570"," Ground to dust so far, coiling in the market."
"2421260","2423120"," Keep these on the screen so you can see them. "
"2427260","2428480"," Thanks for subscribing over."
"2428640","2429060"," Just subscribe."
"2429660","2432100"," Hope this helps you guys. "
"2432320","2438200"," So if I'm not here one morning, when you guys tune into me every day, and if you're trying to"
"2438200","2442420"," learn how to trade, you should write this stuff down and be like, yep, he's not here one day."
"2442480","2444760"," I'm going to do this exact stuff every morning."
"2454420","2455960"," Yeah, ready for morning siesta. "
"2464500","2465920"," All right, right on."
"2465920","2466420"," Thanks, Jaymore."
"2473120","2475640"," Yeah, go back and go back and watch this stuff. "
"2475760","2476920"," This is how I prepare for my day."
"2477100","2477360"," Every morning."
"2477360","2478580"," This is what I do every single morning. "
"2478760","2481640"," Every morning, I'm like, okay, I'm going to go through all this stuff and look for the highest"
"2481640","2484260"," probability trades for us."
"2485700","2486780"," Yeah, every morning."
"2494590","2497290"," You know, John Haggard is talking about Dixie. "
"2497510","2499510"," This is another part that I didn't talk about."
"2499630","2500510"," I'll talk about this too."
"2500830","2504450"," Another thing that I take a look at every day, usually, I haven't done it a lot lately. "
"2505870","2511470"," But if I can't get any inference from this information, I'll begin to look around sectors in the"
"2511470","2511770"," market."
"2512390","2514570"," The biggest ones that I check are HYG."
"2515310","2516550"," I check HYG. "
"2516990","2518410"," I'll check Dixie."
"2519370","2522690"," So, VIX, HYG, Dixie."
"2523570","2525790"," I'll check some of the main drivers of the market, Apple. "
"2526310","2528070"," I'll look at all the Fangman plus T."
"2529010","2533490"," Not T as much as I used to, but basically the Fangman stocks."
"2534170","2535410"," Apple's a big one in there."
"2536630","2539930"," Then I'll look at some of the sectors, sub sectors of the S&P 500. "
"2540290","2540870"," I'll check the waiting."
"2541270","2542490"," Remember yesterday we talked about industrials."
"2543710","2546530"," We talked about how tech could be rotated back into. "
"2546530","2552250"," If I'm looking for the market to really bleed off, I'm anticipating kind of a role."
"2553550","2560430"," It would be the first sector that could get rolled into so we don't have a full liquidation break"
"2560430","2561030"," or a moment."
"2561730","2562670"," Probably going to be tech. "
"2563270","2564190"," Tech is underweight right now."
"2564750","2566010"," Industrials is underweight right now."
"2569610","2571490"," I'll check XLF and see how strong that is. "
"2571630","2574810"," We know right now we've got ERs coming out for XLF."
"2574810","2578310"," That would be a driver or a catalyst for the market to go down, right?"
"2578790","2582710"," They're a large significant part of the S&P 500."
"2585520","2586560"," Thanks, Purnerville Tom. "
"2595450","2598730"," Pivot's a calculator with previous support and resistance levels."
"2598970","2599910"," You can look up your own calculator."
"2600390","2602210"," There's two or three different ways to calculate them. "
"2603490","2605130"," So you can look those up on your own."
"2608660","2610760"," Nothing rocket science, nothing out of the norm."
"2612320","2618540"," I wrote a – what are you saying?"
"2619180","2619660"," Hold on here. "
"2619720","2621100"," I'm missing some of you guys are saying here."
"2626200","2630260"," Biggest rally into ER season since 2009 sets high expectations."
"2638840","2639660"," Like buttons. "
"2640220","2641600"," Gold plus silver like a rocket."
"2643360","2644320"," 300 people likes Cmon."
"2644700","2645540"," Thanks for the like stuff. "
"2647580","2649040"," And they got puts yesterday."
"2651120","2652060"," Structure on a fly."
"2652320","2655220"," We'd have to spend an entire morning. "
"2655220","2656180"," Morning on doing flies."
"2656520","2657720"," Selling and buying of flies."
"2658660","2659560"," I guess it is. "
"2659760","2661060"," That's not like a five minute talk."
"2661740","2662600"," Reading short, bro."
"2662820","2664000"," 100% for full or short queues. "
"2665320","2667100"," I love you for site finance."
"2670000","2671460"," Morning to all of you out there too."
"2672180","2673780"," Trying to read about three a bunch of your comments. "
"2676750","2677990"," Morning to everybody out there."
"2691920","2694040"," Even work can't kill this market, sir."
"2697300","2698980"," Starting to squeeze higher right now. "
"2702420","2703800"," I'm going to move a nice little squeeze."
"2707750","2708890"," Let's take a look around the market."
"2708990","2710050"," I'm going to take a look at HYG. "
"2710930","2711450"," Dixie."
"2714050","2715390"," HYG, bullish baby."
"2716230","2716810"," Super bullish. "
"2718430","2721070"," HYG trading higher than its one hourly."
"2721070","2721970"," It's hourly."
"2722270","2722910"," It's five minutes. "
"2723290","2725050"," It's weekly right now."
"2725470","2727850"," HYG is showing you that we're going higher."
"2728070","2729690"," We might start squeezing there in just a few moments. "
"2730910","2732970"," HYG blasting off right now."
"2734290","2735690"," Blasting, ripping faces."
"2739740","2741500"," Look at Dixie, man. "
"2743300","2744900"," Look at Dixie."
"2746660","2749120"," Dixie telling you a different story right now."
"2749940","2754980"," And not only is Dixie telling you another story, the five minute is coming into its monthly trigger"
"2754980","2755580"," right now. "
"2756500","2759160"," Monthly trigger is going wily right now with Dixie."
"2765260","2766040"," XLF, man."
"2766180","2767700"," Looking like it wants to squeeze, isn't it?"
"2769480","2771400"," XLF looks like it wants to squeeze too. "
"2772460","2778480"," All this coilings get me all flustered here for a giant move coming up."
"2785920","2788600"," Price on VIX trading lower right now."
"2790700","2794260"," I'm not going to have a high expectation here for this move higher. "
"2796040","2799980"," 409.96. This is a pre-market high right here."
"2800780","2802440"," I'll give you two targets above."
"2810920","2814600"," Boy, this is where that bear rage comes into play here, isn't it?"
"2815780","2817440"," This is where everything tells you. "
"2818120","2823520"," This is like when you have a kid, my sister, she used to"
"2823520","2833640"," have a lot of she"
"2833640","2836940"," didn't get what she wanted."
"2838760","2841860"," She would have pulled what my mom called temper tantrums."
"2843580","2847480"," It's like when you're dragging a bear higher and they're having a temper tantrum. "
"2848580","2850880"," You see a child in the store, they just have a full on meltdown."
"2851600","2853820"," You see the parent pleading with the child."
"2854100","2857780"," Back in the day, the parent would just drag the child through the store as they had a meltdown. "
"2858400","2859860"," This is what you do in a bear right now."
"2862640","2864260"," Just a temper tantrum."
"2864680","2868400"," A temper tantrum right here. "
"2868720","2869840"," Guaranteed, temper tantrum."
"2881360","2882920"," When crash, sir."
"2886600","2889420"," You want to know why I think that this is limited upside. "
"2889700","2890660"," I'm going to show you right now."
"2894180","2895540"," Basically the VIX right here."
"2896740","2899160"," This is the price of VIX right now, 1839. "
"2901860","2906840"," Until it doesn't work anymore, I'm going to expect the VIX to bounce down here off 1820."
"2909650","2913670"," Should lend some limited upside to the spy."
"2924130","2925550"," Nowadays, you'll end up with CPS. "
"2925930","2926770"," Oh, yeah, you can't."
"2927050","2928950"," You can't even threaten a child anymore."
"2929250","2934810"," You can't, you can't like, I bet some places you can, but in the rest of the world. "
"2936490","2939410"," In the rest of the world, you can't even threaten a child anymore."
"2941970","2943330"," You can't like look at it."
"2943350","2947450"," Look at it. "
"2949950","2951350"," Those days are over."
"2952690","2957290"," I guess some people get away with it or some kids don't know any better, but most of these kids"
"2957290","2959950"," are on like this dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"2960390","2965190"," Most of these kids are on some form of social media and the social media is like by signing up. "
"2965430","2968510"," If your father looks at you the wrong way, call CPS."
"2969750","2973990"," If your mom, look, your mom doesn't give you an I new iPhone calls DPS."
"2978930","2980270"," You were a right, Nino. "
"3016390","3019900"," It's so true."
"3019900","3025160"," U.S. stocks extend gangs are gangs and gains."
"3027580","3035520"," You guys got"
"3035520","3038820"," Bloomberg news articles. "
"3039760","3042760"," Let me see, dreadful profit trends, tech wave."
"3044960","3046920"," Dixie, there goes my European vacation."
"3047200","3047680"," What about trend?"
"3048460","3048920"," Oh, yes. "
"3049400","3050060"," Yeah, fuck yeah."
"3057890","3059750"," There it is now early, but I called it."
"3062610","3063010"," Morning. "

"3063770","3064010"," My griff."
"3064090","3064410"," How are you brother?"
"3064850","3065890"," What are you looking for?"
"3066050","3067630"," Edges of the range are just sit out. "
"3068090","3069210"," Yeah, you can trade this."
"3069410","3074010"," I got I used to trade this on stream, but I try not to."
"3074150","3076610"," This is a bull on a five minute. "
"3076610","3078110"," Here's a bull flag right here."
"3078930","3083270"," You can see a bull flag right here in pre market to the upside moving the five minute chart."
"3085660","3089060"," So there's your bull flag right there and see it right there. "
"3089220","3090480"," Cross over in pre market."
"3092620","3093820"," Squeezing higher right now."
"3098490","3100750"," Should get another tag above right here. "
"3101170","3103110"," Should get this implied mover near to it."
"3104070","3104730"," Near to it."
"3105410","3108630"," The other thing you're looking for here is you're going to watch this white line right here. "
"3110130","3111550"," You can change this over here."
"3115440","3117360"," There's target price target right there."
"3119260","3127420"," And you're going to look for pullback and confirmation. "
"3128360","3133240"," Another another another attempt higher at 41075 right there."
"3133880","3142680"," Five minute chart right now."
"3142760","3146640"," Notice in the big six moving and spy has a move so financials must be weighing in. "
"3146800","3150100"," Even war can't kill this market by lagging."
"3150100","3150660"," Nope."
"3151220","3152560"," Not what was earlier. "
"3153060","3153380"," Morning."
"3153540","3153980"," Good morning."
"3154080","3154360"," How are you?"
"3155500","3160200"," David G says what's an outside reversal day mean and doesn't apply today. "
"3161540","3163100"," Outside reversal days work."
"3165220","3168300"," They haven't they haven't been working."
"3168840","3171040"," You so an outside reversal day. "
"3171660","3175580"," We've had how many of those when you see me on to it saying when you see me on fin"
"3175580","3177220"," to it saying don't chase that fucking hole."
"3177660","3179300"," Been saying it now for a month."
"3179320","3181020"," Do not chase that fucking hole. "
"3182680","3189080"," And those outside reversal days are chasing a hole and they normally do well."
"3189780","3194640"," They chase that whole week we go we can have continuation next couple days sometimes to come up for"
"3194640","3195140"," the next day."
"3195620","3196700"," Then we continue down. "
"3197540","3202420"," But they haven't been working due to a bunch of different factors like seasonality."
"3203840","3204820"," Business cycle."
"3208320","3211300"," There's some I'm going to show you something else in the background. "
"3212780","3215900"," Why we shouldn't we why you shouldn't follow those."
"3216140","3218760"," Why you shouldn't follow outside reversal days."
"3222520","3227060"," Because right they usually show us that when we've chased that hole it's usually showing us. "
"3227480","3230100"," Oh we're just going straight up now not even caring."
"3230100","3232980"," Just going to blast right up and then implied move here."
"3234960","3237360"," The potential trend change right. "
"3238200","3240380"," So if you're looking at something like this here."
"3240960","3244220"," You would have expected this move down."
"3245280","3250500"," Trend reversal apparent right even if we come up here and reverse down to the downside. "
"3251320","3254240"," Not showing itself as being the case right now is it."
"3255360","3255480"," Right."
"3255480","3258980"," And it hasn't been showing the case. "
"3260260","3264360"," But that's been the case in any of these past few weeks."
"3265200","3270640"," This has proved itself to be inaccurate that the trend reversal is not the case."
"3272380","3276600"," As of yet we're not even we're not even pausing we're just going straight up to the implied move. "
"3277440","3280980"," And HIG is telling us that we're going to blast north right now."
"3283720","3285700"," Just huge moves right there."
"3286420","3287840"," Nice fat squeeze higher. "
"3288560","3290560"," No looking back right there it's beautiful."
"3294320","3296820"," Absolutely beautiful and stunning right there to see."
"3296960","3298340"," Look at that gorgeousness right there. "
"3300080","3301740"," Just look at that gorgeousness."
"3302280","3304440"," Return to the scene of the crime over here."
"3305380","3308560"," Look at that scene of the crime just just returning to it. "
"3309140","3309960"," Look at it."
"3310940","3314260"," Turning to the scene of the crime get the H line above over here."
"3322020","3324780"," Now so did the outside reversal work this morning. "
"3325160","3326240"," Fuck no it didn't."
"3328240","3329240"," Fuck no it didn't."
"3329300","3331440"," I'm going to explain that to you while how you can find out. "
"3333120","3334860"," I'm going to show that to you right now."
"3334860","3336240"," I'm going to show you why."
"3338240","3340220"," Chasing these holes has not worked. "
"3343680","3345820"," I'm going to bring it up for you right now why it hasn't."
"3347960","3349140"," I just brought it up."
"3349220","3350460"," I'm going to show it to you why right now. "
"3352280","3354360"," I'm going to show you why you failed as a bear."
"3358120","3359600"," Oh yeah look at that."
"3362480","3364060"," Look at that nice. "
"3367360","3369060"," I always like to see it."
"3370540","3371760"," How short were people?"
"3372380","3373740"," I'm going to bet pretty fucking short."
"3377320","3382840"," I'm going to bet I'm going to bet I'm going to bet a lot of deleting of tweets going on"
"3382840","3383580"," out there right now. "
"3388590","3392570"," I'm going to bet the whole bunch of delete tweets, delete tweets, delete tweets, delete tweets."
"3393150","3393990"," It's coming."
"3394950","3397810"," It's coming tomorrow not today it's coming on Friday. "
"3399590","3401610"," It's coming on Monday I promise."
"3405010","3406330"," It's coming on Wednesday."
"3408650","3413130"," It's coming on Friday this is just a bear market squeeze right now. "
"3414210","3415870"," Just hang on you'll be fine."
"3416770","3418850"," Just don't answer any calls from your broker."
"3419610","3420550"," Don't answer any calls. "
"3420850","3422110"," Do you get any emails?"
"3422790","3423950"," Don't answer them."
"3426770","3429170"," You're on margin your bear everything is fine."
"3435870","3438190"," Look at that beautifulness right there. "
"3439170","3440870"," Just rip in faces now."
"3441770","3443170"," Keep your eyes over here."
"3443410","3445190"," This is where the crime occurred right here. "
"3445910","3448190"," Crime occurred right here and then above here crime."
"3448390","3450650"," There you have more crime more crime up there."
"3457210","3458670"," Oh, what's that up there?"
"3459030","3462470"," Just taking a look at the fear and greed index 63 out of 100. "
"3463110","3463630"," Whoa."
"3463870","3468470"," A lot of crime up there whole bunch of crime."
"3471830","3473690"," Oh, you feel that one right?"
"3476580","3476960"," Okay. "
"3477360","3482020"," So both like down here five minutes chart pre market."
"3483560","3488740"," Resolve to the upside H.Y.G gave you the hint that we're going to blast higher didn't even wait"
"3488740","3491980"," to do a pullback to confirm the move just lasted straight up north."
"3494250","3496710"," Rick is sharing off the implied move in the high. "
"3498350","3500470"," We're going to talk about something right now."
"3501130","3503410"," You guys already know about what to look for for a pullback."
"3510620","3516630"," We're going to briefly talk about a post that I made this morning. "
"3519680","3523560"," This is the spy will do the SPX if you want doesn't really fucking matter does it."
"3527620","3529160"," And on a daily chart."
"3529160","3534000"," So like if I'm looking on a daily chart on PMO can't see it right here. "
"3534100","3534840"," I'm going to show it to you."
"3536620","3539200"," So watch my cursor right there."
"3540400","3546580"," It says PPO and PMO cursor PPO PMO PPO PMO. "
"3546660","3548380"," You can look these up on your own on trading view."
"3549480","3550700"," On a daily chart."
"3552460","3553480"," On a daily chart. "
"3553840","3556400"," I'll be like, yeah, I'm looking at where we are right now in the spine."
"3556500","3557420"," I'm like, yeah."
"3559180","3562680"," Yeah, we're probably going to roll over in the 18th and 20th right here. "
"3563020","3565100"," Yeah, we could probably roll over here."
"3565360","3565900"," It's looking pretty."
"3566620","3567980"," Pretty, you know, on a daily chart. "
"3568320","3570280"," If I'm looking at that time frame, like, yeah, I'm going to roll over."
"3572420","3573760"," We're probably not going up."
"3573780","3576020"," And if we are going out, it's probably going to be limited. "
"3577660","3578640"," What is that limited?"
"3579220","3579860"," I don't know."
"3579960","3581580"," 412, 413, 414."
"3582780","3587240"," And my initial reaction is, oh, shit, we're going to blast down in here. "
"3588300","3589980"," We're going to make some new lows down here."
"3590020","3591840"," We're going to get out of 370, 360."
"3592580","3596700"," We're going to catch a new low down here, even though we're getting new higher lows, even though"
"3596700","3598500"," we're getting higher lows. "
"3600180","3601220"," We're going way down here."
"3601840","3603700"," See this reaction looking at this chart."
"3604920","3607200"," We're going to finally get rid of those pesky bowls. "
"3607200","3611700"," And we're going to get a new lower low on trend."
"3612940","3614060"," That's the initial reaction."
"3616430","3620670"," On a weekly though, and time of year, and business cycle, well, shit. "
"3622410","3626650"," The weekly is telling me, you might be wrong, Cap."
"3627730","3630350"," On your daily projection here, Captain."
"3631650","3633030"," We don't see that. "
"3634790","3636770"," Here's the zero line right here."
"3637570","3641110"," What this is telling me right now is, we're just getting started."
"3645080","3646480"," At least from previous examples. "
"3647660","3650900"," Hey, Cap, we're just getting started here."
"3651960","3659540"," From previous examples, we're just getting started going up, Captain."
"3660780","3664420"," I'm like, shit, that's telling me a different story. "
"3664700","3672380"," As a matter of fact, if you look at RSI type-based equations, and they come in different forms,"
"3672440","3674820"," they're named different things, but they're all very similar."
"3675580","3678100"," They all use the same black skull type models."
"3678600","3682820"," If you have ever read any white papers on those models, I'm not going to do with you right now. "
"3683560","3686040"," I think I've posted them for you, but if I haven't, I've got them all."
"3686200","3686920"," I've read them all."
"3688500","3695840"," They can stay irrational longer on a daily time frame and weekly and monthly than showing you the"
"3695840","3700180"," actual up and down flow of the market from a weekly and monthly basis. "
"3700820","3701940"," They're kind of shitty models."
"3703180","3710040"," They work, but if you put those models on a weekly or monthly, we just grind higher."
"3710920","3712040"," They don't really tell you enough. "
"3712740","3716560"," Sometimes they even actually show you this happening on a weekly and monthly, even though we"
"3716560","3717620"," continue to grind higher."
"3718460","3721980"," They're not really good models over time."
"3722320","3727620"," These models here are telling you, whatever fucking dip and weakness we have in April will likely"
"3727620","3728120"," get bought. "
"3729260","3735840"," Whatever, in matter of fact, these models right here are saying that we are likely going to fucking"
"3735840","3737400"," melt up the entire year."
"3738240","3743380"," Most of the year, there are exceptions."
"3749160","3754060"," Historically, there are a couple exceptions where we have not done that. "
"3762330","3763270"," Here would be one."
"3769710","3770290"," Excuse me."
"3787220","3788040"," Hold on a minute here. "
"3791440","3794680"," I don't know what's going on here."
"3799870","3801710"," I'm going to show you an exception."
"3816880","3818420"," Right here, this is the monthly chart. "
"3820320","3828920"," Now currently on the S&P 500, the monthly chart is even showing you this is the bottom."
"3830580","3834660"," We're just getting started going up."
"3835360","3836760"," That's what's showing you right now. "
"3837740","3838900"," We're just getting started."
"3840000","3841640"," See these purple bars right here?"
"3841740","3842860"," They're going to turn into green bars."
"3844420","3847620"," We're actually going to blast higher monthly. "
"3849020","3850240"," We're on a new bull run."
"3850940","3852760"," We're getting a soft landing."
"3853680","3854900"," That's what it's telling you. "
"3855540","3860400"," We have some examples though where they've turned down, where this is actually rolled."
"3863240","3869260"," We actually make bigger, larger lows, lasting almost a year."
"3870460","3872020"," One of those examples is 2008. "
"3875620","3876940"," I want to show you this right here."
"3880940","3887100"," See this roll down and see this curve up and then we abruptly roll."
"3887820","3890140"," See that right here too. "
"3890200","3892040"," You can actually see the dark purple line right there."
"3894660","3899080"," You could see that quick roll in this month like May."
"3900580","3905620"," That's where we got our final roll down in the market down here. "
"3907080","3908660"," There is an argument."
"3910580","3916600"," There is, believe it or not, an argument in the market in 2008, that we actually did switch and"
"3916600","3916860"," roll."
"3917700","3923180"," We had this fierce roll over, but outside of 2008 and 2001, historically going back to the"
"3923180","3927620"," beginning of time, in our stock market, that has not been the case. "
"3928660","3932240"," And so far on the monthly, we are still turned up here."
"3934300","3935620"," So how do you take this?"
"3936680","3938380"," As a whole, I'm like, well, I don't know."
"3938520","3941980"," I've got to figure out how I can take this as a roll. "
"3942180","3943720"," I'm not going to show you this right now."
"3943760","3945000"," I'm going to show you this later in the day."
"3946140","3948840"," But I did take a look at unemployment. "
"3949620","3951440"," As a matter of fact, I'm going to do it right now."
"3951440","3952080"," As a matter of fact, I'll just do it."
"3952200","3952460"," Fuck it. "
"3952540","3953300"," We'll just do it right now."
"3953820","3954260"," I'm swearing."
"3955640","3956860"," We'll just do it right now. "
"3957880","3959280"," We're going to add the unemployment rate."
"3961770","3963510"," For those previous examples."
"3965710","3968310"," And you can see the unemployment rate is not telling us. "
"3968430","3975630"," The unemployment rate is not going up .25, .35, .55%. As we come down here, right?"
"3975830","3976810"," We don't have that right now."
"3977350","3984070"," We have a falling unemployment rate and a stabilized employment rate, stabilized demand."
"3984690","3985230"," I want a job. "
"3985510","3985930"," I want to work."
"3987170","3987650"," Okay."
"3988070","3989110"," I'll pay you so much money. "
"3989170","3989310"," Okay."
"3989310","3990730"," I got the job, right?"
"3990870","3993550"," And then some other guys are like, well, some other ones are like, I need to hire some employees."
"3994070","3994830"," And there's none available. "
"3995530","3996810"," That's a good employment rate."
"3996950","3998130"," It means this isn't cranking higher."
"3999250","4004230"," But one big difference, or we know when the unemployment rate is cranking, we get blood baths,"
"4004490","4010870"," cranking blood bath, cranking blood bath, cranking blood bath, cranking blood bath, right?"
"4011410","4011650"," 2008. "
"4014110","4015370"," What was happening here?"
"4016310","4021270"," When we had that instance, employment rate was cranking."
"4021530","4022710"," Unemployment rate was cranking."
"4023070","4024370"," We're not seeing that right now. "
"4024530","4030470"," One of the best indicators of a crash is the unemployment rate or the unemployment rate cranking."
"4031570","4035490"," And just currently in this moment, we're not seeing that."
"4036710","4039030"," We're not seeing that. "
"4046890","4049150"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"4049610","4051430"," Keep on squeezing higher."
"4052310","4057670"," So if you are out there, then you're like, we're getting a crash. "
"4057790","4061490"," The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has shown that I'm not sure to explore free trade feasibility."
"4062730","4067190"," If you're out there and you're like, when we're weak in April, it's going to go down far."
"4068550","4070390"," Nothing is saying that it is. "
"4072430","4073650"," Nothing that matters."
"4074090","4079050"," Tickshrike allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forests and stock instruments."
"4079890","4081150"," Anything that does matter. "
"4081430","4085750"," If you're out there throwing the tens and twos around the fucking thirties and twos, the fucking"
"4085750","4086590"," tens and tens."
"4088270","4090050"," The tens divided by the tens."
"4090410","4090830"," I'm just joking. "
"4092630","4096810"," Whatever you can come up with, it means jack shit."
"4098830","4106279"," What does matter is unemployment rate and higher timeframes matter."
"4107180","4110180"," It's telling you no landing. "
"4111700","4116340"," It's telling you, as long as we maintain trend, we're going up."
"4119729","4124670"," It's telling you, as long as we stay above certain places, the move is higher."
"4128080","4130979"," Now, in the background, you can wait for the Fed to do whatever they're going to do to destroy"
"4130979","4131380"," jobs. "
"4132520","4137279"," And until they can or do, we're going up."
"4141580","4148740"," So all your dreams out there of a collapsing stock market, they don't mean shit until you see"
"4148740","4149720"," rampant unemployment."
"4150399","4151520"," And I don't know how old you are. "
"4151600","4153279"," I must be getting really fucking old."
"4154060","4156540"," Because I have lived through rampant unemployment."
"4157060","4159600"," I've lived through as a young kid in the 87 crash. "
"4161100","4162080"," I remember 2000."
"4163040","4164160"," Clearly, I lived in Vale."
"4165560","4171120"," I lived where Enra, I lived with, I hung out and actually skied and party with those guys. "
"4172740","4173460"," True stories."
"4173460","4174399"," 25 BCF."
"4174540","4175380"," 25 BCF. "
"4175520","4177520"," That's a rule in the forecast of 27 BCF."
"4178060","4186859"," So unless you see rampant unemployment, unless you see, unless you see like Zuckerberg disappear"
"4186859","4191000"," from Hawaii, that's literally what it was like."
"4192160","4193580"," These guys just were gone. "
"4194760","4195280"," Gone."
"4196700","4197660"," One day disappeared."
"4198520","4203640"," The only wealth that you saw standing around was the old Nantucket red type wealth. "
"4205500","4208340"," Bitcoin bros aren't good and that didn't end up the same kind of wealth."
"4211140","4216140"," So right now, I don't know about all this talk you're all talking about out there."
"4216880","4221640"," Now, some of the only waivers are saying, if we break trend, yeah, we're going down to the depths"
"4221640","4222100"," of hell. "
"4222360","4224840"," And even then, I'm like, well, what's the depths of hell?"
"4225620","4227600"," And they're like, well, we're going to 3,200."
"4228720","4232280"," And I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we were just at 3450."
"4234460","4236260"," We were just at 3450, man. "
"4236600","4237740"," It's 200 points, bro."
"4239280","4242560"," Like, you're telling me we're going back to just make sure that we're going higher?"
"4243180","4243700"," That's not a crash."
"4245300","4246260"," It's not a fucking crash. "
"4247680","4249340"," You tell me were we testing the low?"
"4250420","4252420"," 200 points, we can put that shit out in two days."
"4252620","4253420"," We can put that shit on a week."
"4256480","4259860"," He actually said put the weekly natural gas storage reports on the new stage. "
"4260040","4260960"," See they are interested."
"4260960","4264880"," Remember, there was a time when we were talking about pay."
"4265060","4265560"," We're at 345. "
"4266040","4266320"," What's next?"
"4266620","4269900"," 3,200, 2,800, 1,600, 2,400, 2,600."
"4270860","4273320"," 1,400 market collapse meltdown."
"4275120","4281400"," So my question is always about the question is always involves price. "
"4284260","4288260"," Now if the lowest 3,200 now, I should have bought 3,450."
"4291900","4299300"," If we trade down to 3,200, I should also buy 3,200, right?"
"4302000","4302760"," And the move is up."
"4304340","4308880"," So that's what gas stays low off the EIA storage data down to people 4%. "
"4310320","4319900"," Now saying that, saying all that bullshit, as long as we stay on trend, the market will, I promise"
"4319900","4322040"," you, climb higher."
"4323040","4328520"," Not promise you, but until you get your unemployment shit up, till you bears can get, to get Jerome"
"4328520","4334260"," to actually break some shit and not support it, the market is not yours."
"4338700","4340320"," I apologize, it's not. "
"4341040","4343440"," You don't own it, and you won't get much money."
"4343620","4348280"," If you're a bull out there like me that wants that low, it's not my market either."
"4349380","4357480"," It's kind of a sobering feeling and thought knowing I want to buy Tesla at $65, probably being"
"4357480","4359460"," robbed of that opportunity right now. "
"4361580","4363080"," And I sold Tesla."
"4364620","4367500"," If I can sold it, I should have just hold it."
"4368840","4374040"," I shouldn't have sold it because I likely won't see another opportunity to buy that at 100 bucks"
"4374040","4374400"," again. "
"4375640","4376380"," This year."
"4379880","4380920"," Probably won't."
"4381080","4382760"," The high probability of it not happening. "
"4387170","4388250"," I hope it happens."
"4389650","4398480"," But right now, the way the market, what the market is saying, the market is telling you no."
"4401670","4412020"," And the market is telling you, whatever weakness we have in April, likely is not"
"4412020","4413620"," going to be full liquidation mode. "
"4414120","4419020"," And if you get a full liquidation mode, it's likely in price not going to be as low as you"
"4419020","4419640"," think it is."
"4428200","4428920"," And it sucks."
"4429440","4434800"," I want you to know that I want the market to go to the like, if it goes to 1400"
"4434800","4437260"," or 2800 or 2600. "
"4437900","4439680"," 2400 to be fucking stoked."
"4441440","4443980"," I would secure my children's future."
"4445140","4447120"," I would never have to work again. "
"4448600","4451040"," I would no matter what happened to me."
"4451720","4455020"," I know my kid's future would be set for life for life."
"4455380","4456840"," There'd be nothing they could do. "
"4456940","4459960"," I could structure it so they would never ever have to worry the rest of their lives."
"4463560","4466860"," Probably my grandchildren would never have to worry again."
"4470550","4471970"," So it's not like I don't want it. "
"4472650","4473710"," Of course I want it."
"4474550","4476370"," The likelihood of it happening right now."
"4477850","4478930"," Is unlikely. "
"4486650","4489010"," No bank earnings cannot have."
"4489490","4490570"," It's a good question."
"4491190","4492270"," And I got the question. "
"4492530","4495330"," Can bank earnings have a big say in that thesis cap?"
"4495630","4496010"," But no."
"4496850","4499290"," You need structural economic."
"4500890","4501230"," Disaster. "
"4502470","4503490"," You need like."
"4504290","4504670"," It's not."
"4504870","4507630"," This isn't a question of this isn't a question of like. "
"4507630","4513110"," Hey, we get some bad earnings or we trade or let's say all of earnings or sell the news."
"4514490","4519570"," It's not enough to cause that bloodbath that we are looking for as a group."
"4520210","4520830"," It's not enough. "
"4523670","4528010"," If anything, if anything, Jerome screwed the whole."
"4528430","4530710"," Jerome broke the contract with America."
"4531610","4533650"," His last rate decision. "
"4534550","4538730"," When they decided to support regional banks, he broke the contract with you and I."
"4538730","4541090"," Kind of in my view so far."
"4541290","4541610"," Yes."
"4543250","4548310"," If they come in and support commercial real estate, if they come in and support. "
"4548850","4551210"," If they if they're trying to do this like methodical."
"4553170","4554830"," Modern monetary support theory."
"4555310","4555610"," I don't know. "
"4555650","4556950"," I don't know how I would label that yet, but."
"4557770","4558510"," It likely."
"4560890","4561650"," It likely. "
"4562490","4564770"," Blunt some of that truly."
"4565450","4567350"," They need to get above the rate of inflation."
"4568290","4570990"," For an extended period of time. "
"4571730","4572990"," Before they cut rates."
"4574030","4575110"," They need to ready."
"4575770","4576270"," Destroy. "
"4577790","4578590"," Demand."
"4579230","4579550"," Destroy."
"4580870","4586230"," Not me go out vacation this summer and see packed vacation spots everywhere. "
"4586230","4590930"," Not me go to spend summer in Park City and watch it packed."
"4591570","4595650"," Not me look at property in Park City and not be able to buy it because there's none available."
"4596030","4600730"," Not me trying to go to Florida and do this from me trying to go up to, I don't know,"
"4600890","4604610"," buy a boat right now and find that prices are still through the roof. "
"4605590","4606070"," Destruction."
"4609880","4614520"," Not me seeing companies that shouldn't still be here and not bankrupt."
"4616020","4620900"," Not me seeing that there's no one available to hire. "
"4621900","4629480"," Not me seeing that for me to hire an unskilled labor right now is costing me $30 to $40 an"
"4629480","4632560"," hour in cash per hour."
"4633460","4637520"," None of that equals market crash."
"4649780","4652180"," Yeah, it's all it's all bullshit, man. "
"4653660","4655100"," And I'm like, I'm a boy."
"4655260","4659060"," I used to be a bear, but I can't see it, man."
"4659240","4660900"," And things aren't saying that it's there. "
"4661520","4664900"," You know, anyone that's like, Hey, I want to see that 2000 that second roll down."
"4667700","4671400"," Even I know that everyone was like, yeah, Mike Barry's being embarrassed by saying you bought the"
"4671400","4671580"," dip."
"4671580","4676160"," Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike Barry is telling you is they bought the fucking dip. "
"4676960","4678020"," Like they're holding."
"4679240","4680500"," We're not ready for the."
"4680640","4683480"," Oh, eight second, the second leg down just yet. "
"4684960","4687460"," That's what I think in my view, that's what he's telling you."
"4697040","4697520"," Yeah."
"4698720","4699200"," Yeah. "
"4699200","4703060"," The fed broke in my view so far right now."
"4703100","4705520"," The fed is, I don't know if they've completely broken the contract."
"4705840","4706820"," They've extended it. "
"4707400","4711220"," So if you're like me and you're like, yeah, this might last and a 2023."
"4712220","4713100"," Maybe 2024."
"4714420","4718920"," It looks now to me at least it looks now like, yeah, maybe it's 2025. "
"4721620","4724480"," You know, it's not, it's not what we thought."
"4725220","4726120"," It's not what I thought."
"4726120","4730300"," I was like, yeah, like when the regional banks happen, I was like, fuck those banks. "
"4731080","4735080"," It was like, fuck those banks, fuck everybody."
"4736120","4738160"," And that balance sheet started turning up."
"4738360","4739800"," I was like, they're doing it. "
"4740420","4741840"," They're fucking doing it."
"4742560","4743700"," I'm sorry for swearing."
"4743860","4744360"," They're doing it though. "
"4744640","4744900"," Thank you."
"4745080","4745320"," Crushes."
"4745680","4746400"," There are vulnerabilities. "
"4751360","4752200"," It was gross."
"4753040","4762460"," It was gross."

"4771920","4772180"," All right."
"4772240","4772760"," Let's take a look here."
"4772880","4773600"," This is the one minute chart. "
"4775200","4776660"," We'll probably get some weakness here."
"4776800","4777760"," Trying to come back down."
"4777880","4779540"," It's 10 40 a.m. right now. "
"4779560","4781940"," We did not get a new high at 10 30."
"4782020","4782840"," We did not get a new high."
"4782880","4784740"," So we'll come back and we'll recheck this down below. "
"4784960","4786100"," This 409 64."
"4787240","4792020"," So we'll bring this back down here and look to see if we can hold on to where we currently"
"4792020","4792460"," are."
"4793080","4794720"," If not, we'll come back down here. "
"4795460","4797720"," We will check this more than likely."
"4797780","4801240"," It's slowing down, which will lead to the effects of recalibrate their own policies."
"4802820","4805180"," This looks like the sideways trade, guys. "
"4805560","4806320"," It could be wrong here."
"4807220","4811340"," But what it's saying right now is that we're in the sideways trade right now."
"4811560","4815540"," What the market is telling us is so far. "
"4817220","4818800"," What the market is telling us."
"4818800","4823800"," Is that we're in the sideways and up trade."
"4825900","4827540"," And we're in a seasonally. "
"4828760","4830840"," We should get a nice little bloodbath right here."
"4832900","4834560"," We should get a nice little bloodbath right here."
"4834800","4835260"," Let me look at this. "
"4837320","4837760"," Shocker."
"4840240","4841120"," Like clockwork."
"4841380","4842600"," It's past four weeks, been like this. "
"4843700","4845380"," It's been actually a really good trading range."
"4846360","4848240"," So we're down here by the dip, right?"
"4848400","4849000"," That's cell spy."
"4849000","4850900"," By the dip, cell spy. "
"4851360","4852300"," Where we are right now?"
"4852940","4855140"," By the dip, cell spy, right?"
"4855800","4856440"," That's the VIX."
"4857640","4858580"," Like clockwork."
"4859580","4861940"," So what are we going to get in here more than likely?"
"4862460","4863420"," We could squeeze higher. "
"4864360","4868920"," But somewhere up in here, even if we were to squeeze up here, should get some kind of a cell."
"4872100","4875240"," Should get some kind of a cell and weakness here coming up."
"4885540","4888120"," Another fascinating thing to look at right now, too. "
"4888960","4890280"," Something else that's fascinating."
"4891880","4893100"," This is a one month chart."
"4894380","4895300"," What do we got here?"
"4898640","4899920"," We got a low right here. "
"4900780","4902820"," We got a little dipage, but we got a higher low."
"4903240","4905780"," We got a higher low, believe it or not, that's a higher low."
"4906400","4908640"," Lower than the day before, but higher than the run. "
"4910020","4913560"," And so far, no lower low down here, right?"
"4913560","4918420"," So taken as a whole, move still looks like it's up so far."
"4919160","4921160"," Still looking like it's pushing higher here."
"4922460","4924280"," That's a one hour chart right now. "
"4925160","4927080"," It's actually looking pretty bullish in here, isn't it?"
"4928200","4930460"," Right down here at 4961 on the hourly."
"4934080","4935340"," 4961 right in here."
"4956570","4957790"," Yeah, I agree with you, Thomas. "
"4959230","4960250"," I agree with you."
"4960490","4962750"," It looks like right now, Thomas."
"4963010","4963730"," I agree with you. "
"4963730","4967250"," And what it looks like right now is correction in time, right?"
"4968210","4969890"," It's been looking like that, right?"
"4970090","4975210"," In December of 2020, it started with spec growth, made its way through everything."
"4976030","4979850"," And now what they're doing is they're just going through in the business cycle and clipping."
"4980770","4982030"," I show you the business cycle sometimes. "
"4982610","4983670"," They just clipped oil."
"4983890","4986010"," Then they came in and they clipped financials, right?"
"4987050","4992570"," And they're just going through each sector and just routing them one by one rather than doing the"
"4992570","4993610"," entire thing all at once."
"4993610","4994550"," It's very surgical. "
"4994930","4995910"," I agree with you."
"4996110","4997050"," It's very surgical."
"4998910","5003070"," Meanwhile, they're saving the S&P 500 in no wait. "
"5005130","5007350"," We talk about this sometimes in no wait."
"5007910","5009030"," They did say."
"5009910","5011510"," So like yelling, right?"
"5012430","5013830"," You girl yelling out there. "
"5014510","5020410"," Her and her boy, Jerome, they were quoted."
"5021370","5026670"," I think a few weeks before the GFC or that the GFC, but the housing crash."
"5027730","5033590"," They were having like a conversation and they were like, yeah, at least we saved homes for people. "
"5034710","5036510"," And behind the closed door."
"5037770","5039630"," They're like, as long as we save."
"5040610","5044230"," Main street America's homes and their retirements. "
"5044670","5045750"," We've done our job."
"5046010","5046710"," Fuck the stock market."
"5049530","5052690"," And they got run right over right in a way. "
"5052750","5053730"," They got run right over."
"5054810","5057750"," People did lose their retirements and people did lose their homes."
"5058410","5059950"," They were living out of their cars. "
"5062230","5068590"," And that's part of the meetings with the banks and inside of the Fed where they were like, Hey,"
"5068750","5069150"," what do we have?"
"5069570","5070170"," What's going on here?"
"5070270","5072930"," And they're like, Oh, by the way, you have to go to Congress, the Senate."
"5073870","5079010"," And pass a money bill for us to bill us all out paycheck payrolls for all these companies in the"
"5079010","5079610"," United States."
"5080770","5086130"," And they vowed supposedly that's the rumors that they vowed ever since then behind closed doors"
"5086130","5087990"," that they would never allow that to happen again. "
"5088710","5092690"," They would do whatever it took to not allow that to happen ever again."
"5093330","5098370"," That's what Thomas is talking about right now is the continuation of a correction over time."
"5109970","5110770"," What do I care?"
"5111030","5114530"," What are my thoughts on what's going on with trying to replace the dollar as the world currency?"
"5114870","5118590"," Yeah, I think that's the I think if I was a bear. "
"5119490","5121030"," If I was a bear."
"5122250","5124230"," I signed up a friend late last night about this."
"5124230","5128390"," And I said, if it was one true. "
"5130830","5131270"," Moment."
"5132790","5136430"," I think you'll get the I think you'll get the volatility that you'd the normal volatility."
"5136430","5138390"," So we have selling May, right?"
"5138770","5139510"," Sell in May. "
"5140990","5143090"," In and around there like a ballpark, right?"
"5143870","5144530"," Whack the ball."
"5144690","5145390"," It's going to be near there."
"5145610","5146390"," Sell in May. "
"5147010","5151130"," And then we usually have a nice sell off in summertime."
"5153430","5159230"," So there's not hopes, but bears know they're going to get some ball from the debt ceiling, whether"
"5159230","5160070"," it's real or not."
"5161630","5164930"," Bears know they're going to get debt ceiling. "
"5167370","5167890"," Definitely."
"5168670","5169650"," But the real one."
"5170170","5174690"," We shouldn't talk about these things, but the real thing that the only thing that I can see that"
"5174690","5176790"," bears have going for them in that collapse scenario. "
"5178110","5182310"," Or market collapse scenario is every just like every two three years."
"5182970","5186110"," Just like every by every year three, we have a bull run."
"5187090","5188010"," Right around there. "
"5188290","5191630"," Not even an average like 90% of the time every through by every third year."
"5192350","5197790"," We'll I'll do an SPX a VIX minus SPX and show it to you, but bears get sells like it's"
"5197790","5198730"," overrun every three years."
"5199450","5202950"," Regardless of what's going on every three years like bull run. "
"5203890","5207970"," But also every three to five years we usually have something really bad happen."
"5208410","5210570"," And we haven't had something bad happen, have we?"
"5211410","5214930"," We had we had COVID happen and that was 2019."
"5215730","5218450"," We're in 2023 right now. "
"5218750","5219510"," We're kind of do."
"5220550","5221830"," We're kind of do for that."
"5221830","5224990"," Maybe that moment in the market where we have a big blush. "
"5225870","5230830"," So the only thing that I think bears could have on their side would be that we know about at"
"5230830","5232230"," least would be."
"5235270","5236670"," Possibly Taiwan and China."
"5236830","5237350"," That would be it. "
"5237930","5239810"," So just on the replacement of the dollar."
"5240050","5241070"," I don't think it'll ever happen."
"5241810","5242370"," Ever. "
"5244410","5245910"," We'll go to war before that happens."
"5250740","5251500"," All right."
"5258380","5259380"," What am I supposed to do in here?"
"5260220","5261000"," Hold on a second. "
"5265850","5267130"," I'm going to read some here."
"5273870","5276410"," Have no idea what resub day is."
"5277010","5277870"," Resub day. "
"5279510","5283600"," Have no idea."
"5305420","5306840"," That's the only thing that I can think of."
"5307080","5314260"," The only thing I think of that would be that or maybe with how old our presidential candidates are. "
"5314860","5316800"," That could be something that could play into it."
"5317600","5319040"," It'd have to be something like that."
"5319280","5321820"," And that, you know, I don't know if that's the summer. "
"5322060","5323380"," I don't know if that's in two years."
"5323900","5328460"," If that's in three years, don't think that can see that in raging unemployment."
"5329680","5332680"," And that or those are your three things, right?"
"5332900","5334920"," I guess you've got like that things that we know. "
"5335540","5337400"," Like true volatility, true like."
"5338340","5342240"," True danger to our stock market would have to be some kind of event that we don't know that's going"
"5342240","5342600"," to happen."
"5342600","5344160"," Some kind of a tragic event. "
"5345660","5348380"," Or time where the Fed does its thing."
"5348960","5352480"," And eventually the Fed has rates higher than the rate of inflation."
"5353400","5354840"," Eventually we start to break stuff. "
"5356720","5363960"," Or the only other way that I would see it would be just the natural business cycle that companies"
"5363960","5364500"," go through."
"5366830","5368930"," We do see real true unemployment."
"5370090","5374390"," That's another discussion for another time that has to do with does the Fed actually. "
"5376010","5380890"," Does the Fed really have anything to do with this stuff with the rate of inflation with inflation"
"5380890","5382190"," with business cycles."
"5382190","5383650"," They claim that they do."
"5383810","5389390"," But there are previous Fed presidents and memoirs that have said, we try to time all this shit. "
"5389990","5395790"," Like they're like, we try to time our tools with what we think is the business cycle."
"5396330","5402510"," We know right now with COVID that no one wants to discuss that we've we've fucked with that natural"
"5402510","5403850"," cycle for businesses."
"5404990","5406550"," We've been messing with it. "
"5408030","5412130"," We know that we knew if you I don't know how ever participant you are on the stock market."
"5413950","5421830"," But pre COVID we were heading into a likely recessionary and down move in the stock market."
"5422410","5426290"," We were likely at the end of a short term debt cycle heading into COVID. "
"5426550","5428530"," I don't know if you know that or not, but that is true."
"5429150","5430610"," There was an expectation of that."
"5431710","5436170"," But then you've got companies that are like, yeah, I'm at the end of my my business life and you're"
"5436170","5438730"," going to give me $3 million for free sweet. "
"5440170","5441010"," Let's take it."
"5441610","5445830"," I get another chance to to resuscitate my shitty company."
"5448590","5449850"," And they took it. "
"5450470","5451770"," You know, this isn't mom and dad."
"5451910","5454010"," This isn't Bob on Main Street."
"5454430","5457450"," If you're any guys out there that think the like Bob on Main Street got money. "
"5457450","5460750"," They didn't get shit like some companies got."
"5462490","5466430"," If you guys remember, do you guys remember like do you remember in Jerome Powell was sitting in"
"5466430","5467050"," front of the Senate."
"5469170","5472350"," And some of you guys, I don't know how many of you people remember this stuff like. "
"5473530","5476130"," They made like a Main Street loan program."
"5477090","5480070"," And Jerome wasn't giving any of that money to Main Street."
"5480850","5483230"," Small, small, medium sized businesses. "
"5484250","5484610"," That's you."
"5486770","5488530"," He was like, they're never going to pay it back."
"5488850","5490610"," He said it in a Senate meeting, clean blank. "
"5490830","5491990"," He said they're never going to pay it back."
"5492590","5493450"," Just give them the money."
"5494050","5495390"," I don't care how you will label it. "
"5495650","5496690"," Just give those people the money."
"5497690","5499410"," And they're like, well, who are you giving the money to?"
"5499530","5504310"," And he's like, large companies, given the money to large companies, publicly listed companies."
"5507750","5509750"," We're going to give them great, great terms. "
"5513190","5514570"," So you artificially."
"5516590","5517150"," Recessitated."
"5518610","5519870"," All of Wall Street. "
"5532460","5533020"," MBI."
"5534020","5536880"," We can rotate and rotate and rotate an MBI."
"5537360","5541500"," As I've stated a million times said this over and over and over. "
"5542200","5544160"," I want to tell you about the MBI right now."
"5546360","5555900"," The MBI works best on oversold conditions, never on overbought conditions."
"5556780","5561300"," Furthermore, when our MBI does roll over, it doesn't show you price. "
"5562960","5568880"," Its best performance is on buying a dip, never on buying or selling a top."
"5570080","5576340"," We talk often about the elevator down and then the rotation trade on high and the probability of a"
"5576340","5578400"," put spread printing versus a call spread."
"5585830","5587430"," I love you for site finance. "
"5588090","5591070"," I love you, brother."
"5596910","5606430"," Each trading short is like, I like the cut of that guy's jib."
"5611230","5615270"," MBI is at top of range, but MBI, we can rotate above there. "
"5615390","5615950"," You know that, right?"
"5616670","5618190"," And then it doesn't show price."
"5618270","5620450"," When we do roll over, it doesn't show price."
"5621730","5622630"," We can rotate. "
"5623170","5624330"," So what day is today?"
"5624770","5625530"," We'll keep counting them."
"5627590","5628550"," April 13th."
"5628550","5629690"," April 13th, right?"
"5630890","5634030"," We can rotate and rotate and rotate and rotate. "
"5634210","5640670"," We can have a down week into the 18th in price won't be where you think it's going to be."
"5640670","5643910"," I know some of you out there, we're going to be like 370 by the 18th."
"5644170","5645310"," I'm like, I don't know, man. "
"5645370","5647870"," Maybe I don't think you're going to get that low."
"5649110","5650890"," I don't think you're getting that low."
"5652530","5654110"," Maybe it's not showing us. "
"5656490","5657550"," Let's talk about trend."
"5668590","5669610"," Look at that, huh?"
"5670210","5673130"," Spy just getting right back up there and holding trend higher, huh?"
"5674270","5676850"," Spy is like, I want to close some shit above."
"5676850","5677470"," Ooh. "
"5681490","5682950"," Could be a false break out here."
"5683070","5685270"," I'm going to show you a couple things in the background here."
"5689600","5690500"," Just a second here. "
"5690920","5692020"," Couple things I want to show you guys."
"5693620","5700920"," If you're thinking about the trade higher right now, just be careful of the fake out here."
"5701800","5703760"," I want you to show your price down here. "
"5705060","5707360"," So Vix comes back down here, right?"
"5707360","5709920"," You got to squeeze and spy, and then it traps you and bounces."
"5711940","5719060"," We also have Friday coming up tomorrow, which means we might sell the Vix into Friday and begin the"
"5719060","5720020"," roll lower."
"5720980","5726380"," So that translates right now to push higher and the roll right here. "
"5727320","5733440"," So if you're Aaron puts, what you can do is just hold, I would say just hold on to him."
"5734820","5736240"," Though trend is up right now."
"5736280","5736960"," It's the one minute chart. "
"5737140","5737860"," Let's check the five minute."
"5738160","5738900"," Yeah, five minutes."
"5738980","5740880"," It's just like super fucking bullish, isn't it?"
"5742760","5743480"," Super bullish. "
"5743660","5748720"," We have the price starting above 4, 11, 51, 4, 11, 0, 1 right here."
"5752030","5753370"," Take a look at HYG."
"5758170","5761270"," Could be a false, false ripper here coming up just a minute. "
"5766700","5767760"," I don't know, man."
"5768040","5772320"," HYG is looking like it wants to F-U-C-K if you're going to get my mean in here."
"5773200","5777020"," HYG is like ripping faces off here. "
"5784620","5786620"," Dixie's doing its own thing down here."
"5799750","5802690"," 410 C's from earlier this morning."
"5803430","5813080"," We're not trading $1.26. There's some liquidity up on high right here. "
"5820370","5821990"," Dixie's not doing anything."
"5830580","5832400"," Turn to the scene of the crime, baby."
"5834860","5836240"," Turn to the scene of the crime. "
"5850980","5853120"," Let's see if we can show that in a five minute chart here."
"5854440","5857980"," Oh, oh, there it is."
"5863170","5864410"," Turn to the scene of the crime. "
"5865470","5867390"," Need some call buyers to step in right now."
"5878210","5880170"," I'm going to read some news in the background now."
"5881130","5882270"," Daddy gas, baby. "
"5883090","5884830"," I'm reading some of that in Daddy gas news right now."
"5899400","5901500"," I was reading a story today."
"5902140","5903840"," I don't know if this has hit the news or not. "
"5905280","5906820"," I haven't seen any news on this."
"5906960","5908200"," Maybe there has been news."
"5909320","5913780"," I'm in a real estate investor group. "
"5917500","5920140"," Yeah, Amazon's ripping off that news this morning, right?"
"5920640","5929480"," JPM raised the size of mixed shelf offering, 1.25. 1.16 billion from 100 billion on Amazon."
"5931300","5934720"," I'll announce this new tools for building with janitor of AI on AWS."
"5935240","5937540"," That's the Amazon news and then JPM news. "
"5938620","5941060"," And then anyways, I was in this group this morning."
"5941880","5944040"," And there was a guy that posted that said."
"5945420","5950180"," So if you go to a home depot for supplies, well, not home. "
"5950180","5951400"," It's going to all of them."
"5953400","5959320"," If you go to home depot for supplies, you can go to Menards was a couple of things."
"5959480","5963920"," I don't know if you guys know this or not, but I don't know if you guys flip houses or"
"5963920","5964860"," renovate your own homes. "
"5964860","5966460"," Some of you may or may not know this."
"5972050","5974650"," Menards offers an 11% rebate."
"5976590","5977790"," Well, let's start somewhere else. "
"5979090","5979690"," Whoa."
"5979810","5983790"," $12 billion of reopened 10 year bonds on April the 19th."
"5985030","5987370"," Apologies as 20 year bonds on April the 19th. "
"5987430","5994370"," The system will make the first new self 48 billion dollars in six month bills on April the 17th to"
"5994370","5995010"," April 20."
"5995590","6002050"," And the US itself 34 billion dollars of one year bills on April the 18th to April the 20th."
"6003170","6003750"," Let me see. "
"6003810","6004450"," Let me start at the beginning."
"6005050","6008210"," Some building supply warehouses are really good."
"6008510","6011210"," Our building supply building supply houses are really good in pricing. "
"6012050","6013510"," Quality of goods, that kind of stuff."
"6013790","6016770"," And they're also really good for hard to find stuff that you need."
"6021530","6023550"," Home Depot doesn't have actually a lot of shit. "
"6023750","6026230"," If you're going to rebuild a home, it doesn't have everything that you need typically."
"6026850","6029370"," They have some stuff and a lot of this stuff is crap."
"6030770","6033990"," But you can usually get some decent deals there too. "
"6034330","6039010"," If you ever flip or renovate a home, a lot of people use Home Depot."
"6039410","6042830"," You'll even hear the thing that's Home Depot special build a great special kind of shit."
"6044090","6048230"," Now what some people don't know if you like if you like I go to Home Depot on the weekends"
"6048230","6049870"," to do shit for my house or whatever. "
"6050390","6056030"," We probably don't know is that if you go to Lowe's, you can submit a."
"6056030","6064050"," A list to Lowe's and say, hey, I need all this stuff, right?"
"6064210","6065270"," I need two by fours."
"6065370","6065710"," They need."
"6067110","6069350"," Shingles and any sheets of plywood. "
"6069370","6070430"," They need drywall."
"6071690","6073930"," And I think it's called a market desk or something."
"6074110","6077990"," But anyways, you go to their desk, you hand it to them and they bid on that for you. "
"6078170","6082430"," They give you a bid and say, well, we'll charge you $20,000 for all this material."
"6083850","6085310"," And it was usually a pretty good bid."
"6086230","6089150"," You can usually they usually outbid on a lot of stuff. "
"6089610","6095210"," Now we're not questioning if Lowe's has good shit or not or what Lowe's is geared towards."
"6097430","6099490"," Who their customer base is and that kind of stuff."
"6100010","6102850"," But that's you can usually get a good deal there. "
"6103470","6106550"," And another place you get a good deal every once in a while was Menards."
"6106870","6109850"," They have 11% rebates on some of their stuff."
"6110330","6115950"," So let's say you go and you buy shingles for an 11% rebate at Menards, they'll send you a"
"6115950","6118950"," check in the mail and not all of their stuff has a rebate. "
"6119470","6120370"," Some of it doesn't."
"6120490","6120990"," Some of it doesn't."
"6121090","6122070"," There's stuff that doesn't have a rebate. "
"6122270","6122730"," It's usually cheap."
"6123550","6126950"," So if you're like, I bought my shingles and I got my rebate check back, I can go and I"
"6126950","6128470"," can get nails, right?"
"6128730","6130170"," And that check goes towards the nails."
"6130630","6131890"," You save some decent money. "
"6132270","6132850"," Home Depot."
"6134790","6139790"," You used to be able to take that rebate over to Home Depot and Home Depot would give it to"
"6139790","6140330"," you immediately."
"6140630","6142690"," You wouldn't even have to respend it at Menards. "
"6143110","6146250"," You just, they'd be like, yeah, well, you got an 11% rebate at shingles."
"6146370","6147130"," We'll match that price."
"6150680","6152720"," You get some other discounts at Home Depot as well. "
"6152880","6154020"," You get like 2% or whatever."
"6154340","6156600"," I think it's like 2% as a contractor or something like that."
"6158720","6162460"," If you go to Home Depot, well, Home Depot, I guess I'm saying this because I haven't read this in"
"6162460","6163520"," the news and maybe it's there. "
"6163700","6167280"," The US itself $57 billion in three month bills in April 17th."
"6167600","6169000"," Oh, close the gap, baby."
"6169000","6170240"," Close that gap. "
"6171080","6172360"," There's the gap right there."
"6175690","6176850"," That's the first gap."
"6177190","6179010"," The second gap is way up there. "
"6183760","6185300"," Home Depot did away with that."
"6186000","6190700"," I don't know if that's made news yet or not, but they're not honoring rebates any longer."
"6193600","6197320"," No rebate honoring anymore for Home Depot. "
"6197320","6198260"," That's pretty big news."
"6199320","6202040"," I don't know how much money you spend at Home Depot."
"6202040","6203780"," You might think you spend a lot of money in Home Depot. "
"6204200","6212180"," When I was actively buying and flipping homes, I'd spend when I was doing it a lot."
"6212440","6218220"," When I first moved to Detroit, it was spend $100,000 and $50,000 a material a year."
"6218920","6222340"," It's not a ton, but you're like a homeowner out there. "
"6222480","6225620"," Let's say you spend, I don't know, one, two, three, four, five thousand."
"6227640","6228400"," That was what?"
"6228400","6230760"," 30 or 40 of you out there."
"6230980","6232340"," You spent 300 a year. "
"6232440","6233800"," They figured on average something like that."
"6235040","6236500"," It was maybe like 100 of you."
"6237080","6238540"," Just one of me, right?"
"6238700","6242000"," So you got like another thousand of me up there. "
"6242080","6243620"," It's a pretty big chunk of their business."
"6246850","6250410"," No more discounts for high, high prices, high ticket items."
"6255070","6256190"," They did match. "
"6257250","6260810"," What I've been told is that just ended because my point."
"6261590","6262910"," That just ended."
"6263570","6266070"," Huge discussion in this group that I'm in. "
"6277000","6278500"," Huge discussion right now."
"6280660","6282000"," Buds buy some puts up here."
"6282220","6282660"," Get close. "
"6284920","6288980"," I think I am hoping for that role down here."
"6291660","6293340"," Unless we're going to reprice the VIX today."
"6295340","6300020"," I figured we'd reprice it on Friday, but if we're going to do it today, I'm down for it. "
"6304650","6308550"," Let's see, 4.11, 4.11 is 68 cents."
"6315900","6318140"," Amazon is just ripping faces off right now."
"6322950","6324290"," Just by looking good. "
"6326450","6328470"," We're going to talk about Budweiser."
"6329310","6331530"," Today, we're going to talk about Elon Musk today."
"6332930","6334550"," The FRC selling off right now. "
"6339170","6339750"," It's a good JPM."
"6341690","6343610"," JPM with that dip by that we're looking for."
"6344590","6346330"," Talked about that dip by yesterday. "
"6346870","6348370"," Did MS get a good dip by this morning?"
"6348590","6348730"," Yep."
"6349010","6350570"," MS got a great dip by this morning."
"6351730","6355410"," Talked about trying to buy a dip on all these banks that are reporting. "
"6360080","6360480"," BAC."
"6362160","6364140"," Ooh, BAC not doing it today, huh?"
"6370340","6372920"," BAC had a dip by on the open this morning, but that was it."
"6374500","6375640"," Let's take a look at those today. "
"6375640","6381700"," BAC, MS. Thanks a lot."
"6381780","6383060"," Had a nice dip by on this morning."
"6383200","6384560"," Gorgeous dip by on the opening bell. "
"6387410","6388470"," I wish I had bought that."
"6388630","6397160"," We're going to talk about Budweiser and why Budweiser is important."
"6398580","6401180"," You may not know why Budweiser is important. "
"6404780","6411580"," Thomas hinted on it earlier or he did."
"6411580","6415180"," Thomas maybe directly sees this or not."
"6415460","6424720"," I was having a conversation with a friend past couple of weeks and we were talking about, you know,"
"6424860","6429620"," there was this story out there that was like, let me show this to you. "
"6431420","6433700"," Let me show this to you really quick."
"6437160","6438520"," See if there's a way to show this."
"6444310","6445110"," Here's a second here. "
"6452190","6456450"," Let me show this with maybe Apple would be a good one for NVIDIA."
"6458890","6460150"," That's right, I pronounced NVIDIA."
"6463130","6470380"," How do I show this?"
"6493830","6495690"," Let me just take a look at what I'm going to show you guys. "
"6497490","6554180"," I'll show you guys"
"6554180","6554920"," somewhere here real quick."
"6556160","6557920"," I'll lead into this conversation right now."
"6572140","6573120"," So here's NVIDIA. "
"6574740","6576660"," So this is NVIDIA's chart right here."
"6578960","6585020"," And the drum beat is, there's only four tickers carrying the S&P 500."
"6586740","6587680"," This is SNAP. "
"6588700","6596320"," Now it's not carrying the S&P 500, but it's also not, you can see the drop here, right?"
"6597160","6597820"," Drop right there."
"6599040","6601160"," Push back up, push back up right there."
"6601600","6602340"," You know what I'm saying here?"
"6604120","6608620"," Not as outsized of performance, but not too far away. "
"6609720","6616920"," Not as outsized, but these are text stocks that are somewhat following NVIDIA."
"6617500","6623480"," Even though you think they're not, even though you're told, they're like only four stocks are"
"6623480","6625120"," carrying the stock market right now."
"6625400","6629880"," I'm like, yeah, those same four stocks carry, they sell the stock market. "
"6630340","6632500"," They're like, the only ones holding up the stock market."
"6632500","6633360"," I'm like, that's not true."
"6634220","6640240"," The point that I'm trying to make to you here is that if you, this is like the, I remember"
"6640240","6646640"," the first time I figured this out, if you like overlay a lot of these stocks in the stock market,"
"6646800","6656780"," and I mean everything, like fucking small caps, fucking, sorry, tech, spy, there's divergences,"
"6656780","6664860"," but most, most of the companies, like the ones that you and I know, most of them"
"6664860","6670060"," follow each other to some extent. "
"6671940","6676300"," Now there's days when, there's days when some stocks are up and some are not."
"6677000","6682180"," There's rotation into different stocks, but when you look back over like a year, you're like, yeah,"
"6682540","6685880"," they kind of followed the same trajectory."
"6690070","6693830"," So my buddy and I were talking about it and I was like, I was like, you know, I was"
"6693830","6703590"," like, when I finally got that through my thick head, that, you know, like you think"
"6703590","6706330"," that you're getting, you're like, oh, I made a great trade today. "
"6707150","6712170"," But reality is most of the other tickers in that sector probably had a great day."
"6713830","6725070"," So how do you, if that's the case, if that's the general idea over time, that"
"6725070","6730490"," let's say you're like, let's say you're like, I'm a stock picker and you're like, I picked this"
"6730490","6731390"," stock and it did great."
"6732110","6734890"," More than likely, everybody else did pretty good there too. "
"6736790","6742890"," And if the market is down, anyone that picked that stock is likely going to get caught in that"
"6742890","6744070"," market-down situation."
"6746510","6758120"," And if you're trying to catch an edge, if you're trying to catch an edge, if you're"
"6758120","6768820"," trying to catch an edge on the market being up or down in your ticker, your ticker is not, or"
"6768820","6772160"," you want it's like an edge, like, hey, all these tickers are up, all these tickers are down."
"6773260","6774780"," Let's say the market's up one day. "
"6775320","6778660"," Should I be looking at the tickers that are down when the market is up?"
"6778840","6780280"," That doesn't mean you buy them that day."
"6780960","6783640"," But it doesn't mean that you put them on a watch list."
"6785620","6788640"," Especially if they're not trading with the market up or down. "
"6790520","6795300"," And to this point, some you don't want to buy."
"6795980","6801280"," Some, some you have to say, well, maybe we have timeframes on this too."
"6801280","6805720"," But the idea here is, a prime example is Sam Adams. "
"6818270","6820190"," Yeah, I'm watching Amazon in the background right now."
"6820390","6821490"," Amazon's getting cranking right now."
"6825110","6826750"," Hey, you guys are watching Amazon in the background?"
"6826930","6827650"," I'm watching it right now. "
"6828310","6829310"," I just got a text about it."
"6830290","6831970"," Amazon's melting faces off right now."
"6836780","6843740"," So if you're watching these tickers that are down, yeah, you see that Amazon in the background?"
"6848800","6850020"," Yeah, the HD thing. "
"6850700","6852020"," I haven't seen any news on it."
"6852700","6854460"," And there's a big discussion going on about it."
"6855700","6856460"," Huge discussion. "
"6857020","6865960"," So if you're, yeah, well, my point here is, let's say you're not necessarily like, hey, I want to"
"6865960","6866500"," catch a knife."
"6866520","6867380"," My point here is this."
"6867780","6870640"," Samuel Adams had an ER report. "
"6870960","6876160"," And they were like, they were like, well, first of all, we didn't do an update to our ER report,"
"6876160","6876460"," right?"
"6876600","6883620"," We didn't, we didn't, uh, we didn't re, um, so they came in on earnings report and they're"
"6883620","6885380"," accounting, uh, their CFO."
"6885380","6889720"," Nobody came out and said, we're going to, uh, give you new guidance before ER."
"6890140","6891320"," They just rolled in the ER. "
"6891440","6895240"," We're like, well, by the way, we knew three months ago or six months ago that we fucked up with,"
"6895620","6897740"," um, with zero calorie beverages."
"6898420","6906480"," Oh, and by the way, all the C suites sold all their stock and, uh, we really, we really fucked"
"6906480","6906760"," up."
"6907140","6912480"," So they committed some like legal and in shady business practices and some legal fraud. "
"6912480","6915600"," And it was rage inducing, right?"
"6916440","6919660"," There's no, no update to, uh, guidance before they reported."
"6920320","6924540"," Uh, and so I remember when that happened, I was like, ooh, you sell that shit down in a depth"
"6924540","6925060"," of hell."
"6926720","6932560"," So on that note, the market kept going up and Sam Adams sold off for like, what, two straight"
"6932560","6932840"," years?"
"6933400","6934340"," Really bad, right?"
"6935980","6937560"," You should be watching these companies. "
"6944040","6949600"," The key here point though is that you should be watching the, when the market goes up and down."
"6951760","6952360"," That's it."
"6953220","6953860"," Turn that shit off. "
"6955400","6957580"," You should be watching these tickers that get sold."
"6958860","6964380"," Uh, in an otherwise up moving market and you should be finding out why they're getting sold and not"
"6964380","6966800"," to touch your emotions to why they're getting sold."
"6966800","6971660"," Uh, an example would be a lot of these finance company or a lot of these banks specifically. "
"6972360","6973960"," Uh, I remember Vert, right?"
"6974260","6975940"," Verts like Luka and Schickhand."
"6976440","6983800"," Uh, don't buy Vert or Verts, Verts getting caught into the dragnet of banking system failures and"
"6983800","6985180"," regional banking system failures."
"6985780","6989640"," And so you get a basket of these stocks that are not going up at the market and you have"
"6989640","6994020"," to look at them all over one and say, I don't know, man, Charles Schwab, really?"
"6994640","6995500"," They took that kind of hit. "
"6996040","6997220"," Uh, Vert, really?"
"6997380","6998140"," They took that kind of hit."
"6998460","7000160"," They're, you know, are they financially sound?"
"7000360","7001480"," Are they not financially sound?"
"7002740","7004060"," Should I keep them on my radar?"
"7004740","7005100"," Right?"
"7005440","7009560"," So as, so you've got your normal like market going up and down, stocks going up and down, then you,"
"7009640","7014620"," as we're going up, you see some fall off and you go, well, that one over there probably should have"
"7014620","7018840"," fallen off in that, in that big dragnet, but that one may not have, should have."
"7019820","7025540"," So this brings me to the conversation about, uh, these regional banks and how you're trying to"
"7025540","7026680"," identify which ones to buy. "
"7027260","7029340"," And right now, specifically, you see other ones."
"7029580","7031520"," You see Budweiser is on that list."
"7032660","7039680"," Whether you agree or disagree with, uh, LGBT, uh, rights, right or wrong, should not come into"
"7039680","7046320"," your, uh, decision making as, uh, well, I guess, I guess it could come into your decision making. "
"7046780","7051280"," If you're like, yeah, Manti, I don't know, LGBTQ, I choose not to trade it."
"7051520","7052220"," That's one thing."
"7053060","7056440"," But it's, but if you have a trader hat on and you say, well, I'm going to short it into"
"7056440","7058860"," the ground because of LGBTQ and I don't like those people. "
"7059320","7063380"," Uh, you're more than likely going to get torched more than you're going to win."
"7064160","7068160"," Um, because you have to have your trader hat on and you have to say to yourself, okay, so right"
"7068160","7069820"," now, Bud's getting hammered right now."
"7070300","7073920"," If you look at a larger time frame, Bud isn't getting hammered at all. "
"7074800","7077200"," Uh, Bud is not down at all."
"7077200","7082140"," They haven't felt anything on a, if you look at a yearly chart, they're kind of ready to sell off."
"7082840","7089400"," Um, and as a matter of fact, we saw regional banks being sold off months before and they were"
"7089400","7092820"," looking like they were going to sell off months before we ever got there. "
"7093440","7098320"," So if you see those capitulation moments in these tickers and there's no right or real reason why"
"7098320","7102540"," they should be selling off, it may be a buying opportunity for you."
"7102860","7106080"," So if you were to have your traders hat on, you're like, well, I don't like Bud, I don't like"
"7106080","7106840"," Bud what they're doing."
"7107640","7109240"," Whatever it is you're doing. "
"7109660","7113920"," Um, whatever it is that you're, you're doing, right?"
"7114220","7115520"," I'm going to short them into the ground."
"7116360","7119140"," Now you may, you're probably going to get torched at some point."
"7121180","7124400"," I'm going to explain this to you on a, on a, on a better one. "
"7124420","7127660"," I'm going to give you a better, a better thing to talk about here."
"7133530","7135370"," We're going to look at Budweiser really quick."
"7135690","7137830"," So you see Budweiser sell off, right?"
"7138410","7143190"," It's very important for you to separate those feelings, those thought process that you have and"
"7143190","7147850"," look for opportunities where there's blame, right?"
"7148030","7151150"," Especially when people are like, yeah, it's because I don't like those people. "
"7151530","7152650"," That's why it's selling off."
"7152770","7154370"," That's why it's down five billion today."
"7155090","7157970"," Matter of fact, there was an article a week ago that said they're down $1.3 billion. "
"7158650","7163090"," And I'm like, eh, I'm like, they're not really down."
"7167670","7169790"," I'm like, that looks like profit taking to me."
"7171150","7172210"," That's what it looked like to me. "
"7173910","7178690"," And the, the argument is, well, Budweiser's down because of LGBT stuff."
"7178850","7180490"," And I'm like, that doesn't look like it to me."
"7181610","7183730"," This is where they were back in October. "
"7185070","7187050"," Look, then they got bought just fine by me."
"7187150","7188690"," I didn't see any problems with it being bought."
"7189410","7192110"," And if you look down here, this is their daily right here. "
"7192550","7195490"," Looks like they got bought, bought, bought, bought, bought, bought, bought."
"7195490","7195850"," Right?"
"7196030","7202870"," And you see right here, see the, this is called, this is called divergence right here in price to"
"7202870","7204070"," the price, starting to roll over."
"7205350","7209250"," You can see the, see they're already beginning to sell, even though price isn't showing. "
"7210610","7212430"," And you're going to expect the price to fall, which it did."
"7213490","7213590"," Right?"
"7213750","7215190"," And lo and behold, look what happened here."
"7217150","7219610"," Came on support, came on support, right?"
"7219810","7220730"," You can see it right down here. "
"7220850","7222250"," I'm going to show this in a better way."
"7226500","7227760"," You can see it right there."
"7229100","7230580"," See a little bit more weakness right here. "
"7231120","7233180"," And lo and behold, what do you see above?"
"7233640","7235000"," You see the same kind of a thing."
"7236660","7237800"," You can see it right here."
"7238040","7242900"," And you can actually see right here declining volume or declining velocity, right?"
"7243740","7244780"," And starting to sell down. "
"7245120","7250060"," And what are we coming into right now is their daily trend, Budweiser's daily trend."
"7250880","7255520"," You know, this is the company where everybody is out there saying, I'm not going to drink"
"7255880","7256080"," Budweiser."
"7256200","7257300"," I'm going to go drink some other beer. "
"7258340","7261060"," Oh, that beer company that Budweiser actually owns."
"7262260","7268920"," And so if you're seeing this sell off take place, when it should thoughtfully be going up and if"
"7268920","7273420"," there's a little bit more amplification to the cell here, some panic, right?"
"7273540","7277320"," If you're, if you're a Budweiser buyer or something, you're like, Oh, I'm panicking all that kind"
"7277320","7277660"," of stuff."
"7277840","7279980"," Some outsized emotional trading in here. "
"7280640","7282580"," You're probably looking for a dip to buy."
"7283740","7288300"," Probably at some point going to see the I hate Budweiser."
"7288760","7292320"," Matter of fact, I bet if I went to Texas right now in the right bar and the shitty part"
"7292320","7293980"," of town, they're probably drinking Budweiser again. "
"7294640","7297380"," And if they're not going to drink it right now, they're probably going to drink it down the road."
"7297500","7298540"," Do you guys remember Freedom Fries?"
"7299240","7300600"," I don't even remember Freedom Fries."
"7300820","7302100"," That shit went out the window eventually. "
"7302900","7303620"," That shit was gone."
"7303620","7307580"," Freedom Fries and then flash in the pan."
"7309080","7313920"," Everybody went back to calling them French Fries and buying French Fries and all other shit. "
"7315520","7315660"," Right?"
"7316160","7322360"," So if you have an outsized move on the downside here, you're probably looking for a chance to buy"
"7322360","7325280"," Budweiser at some point."
"7325440","7333460"," You probably want to look at it right where it bounced here at 63, 34."
"7333460","7339560"," Maybe that buy is at $60.57 for $59.36 down here. "
"7340080","7340920"," I'll be honest with you."
"7341400","7346960"," There ain't no fucking way Budweiser, in my view, is going to go any lower than where it's been"
"7346960","7348320"," bought every other time."
"7348480","7350680"," The buyers will step in down here. "
"7351100","7354620"," So keep this one on your radar for a dip buy Budweiser."
"7355340","7358100"," And the same goes for anything that you hear out there."
"7358200","7362360"," If you hear, if there's real fraud or corporate, I'm taking all the money and running. "
"7362360","7364280"," We didn't hear anything about that from Budweiser."
"7364480","7370080"," You didn't hear like CFOs saying, okay, we're going to launch the LGBTQ campaign and now we're"
"7370080","7371340"," going to sell out of our positions."
"7372700","7374220"," There's like none of that going on. "
"7374860","7383220"," It's funny too, because like Coors Lite has been a trans LGBTQ rights activist company since like"
"7383220","7383540"," the 1970s."
"7384520","7385280"," You might not know that."
"7385680","7387740"," These people are like, I'm drinking Coors now. "
"7387900","7392380"," I'm like, you probably don't realize they're one of the most progressive beer companies out there"
"7392380","7392940"," in this country."
"7396140","7398300"," But anyways, my point here is this."
"7398560","7399360"," Normal selling. "
"7401760","7405380"," Probably, probably some of this emotional."
"7405880","7407300"," Probably some of this emotional."
"7408280","7414020"," And likely focused upon by someone that knew to get short in here as it was. "
"7414880","7418080"," And they're probably looking for an outsized move to the downside."
"7418800","7423980"," So try to look for when you see some of these, some of this news that drops and realize that"
"7423980","7429000"," a lot of this, a lot of this shit doesn't have to do with politics has to do with someone"
"7429000","7430660"," that short wants to make some money."
"7431620","7434660"," Greed, like ulterior motives in the background. "
"7435380","7440460"," If you see some of these regional banking stocks get some other stocks caught up in their web,"
"7441080","7447820"," right, of normal natural selling, you're probably looking to catch an outsized sell off in a stock"
"7447820","7450500"," that's not expected, but not to be expected to happen in."
"7450900","7453580"," So Budweiser, keep that on your on your radar."
"7453680","7458880"," I have another one out there too that no one has talked about. "
"7463180","7469080"," And I thought someone would bring it up and no one's brought it up to me."
"7470300","7471600"," I have another one out there."
"7475780","7485040"," And that was, or CNN finally, or CNBC finally talked about it on CNBC actually talked about it. "
"7485580","7487540"," They brought up a rocket lab."
"7488480","7490820"," And over the weekend I've been talking about Elon Musk."
"7491020","7491880"," And I was like, you know what?"
"7492240","7497780"," I was like, I want to know these new CEOs that are young. "
"7500120","7507740"," Now, I want to preface this by saying, I have a lot of faith in the, in Elon's companies."
"7508200","7510080"," And believe it or not, I know you're assuming guys disagree in this."
"7510420","7511840"," I have a lot of faith in Starlink. "
"7512020","7514080"," I have a lot of faith in Tesla."
"7515060","7516640"," I've not lost my faith in those companies."
"7517600","7520200"," Some of you have like Elon, some of you don't. "
"7521740","7525200"," For myself, I can't, I can't support Elon any longer."
"7526580","7528340"," As a CEO, I can't."
"7528500","7531460"," And in part, it's for multiple reasons. "
"7532140","7534540"," One of the biggest ones for me though is that I'm getting older."
"7535060","7540180"," And when I see people that are supporting Elon right now, I think about when I was young."
"7541260","7543320"," Oftentimes the older people, old people can't do this. "
"7544320","7549740"," But when I look at Elon right now, I'm trying to look to see, hey, is he more like a"
"7549740","7551660"," Tim Apple or not a Tim Apple?"
"7552480","7559700"," Is he more like a Steve or is he more like a, like someone that young people are looking up"
"7559700","7559920"," to."
"7560020","7567040"," I'm trying to look towards young people and say, in 20 years, in 20 years, are young people going"
"7567040","7569140"," to be supporting and looking up Elon Musk?"
"7570020","7572860"," And, or are they going to be looking towards someone else?"
"7574720","7576400"," Are wanting their own heroes."
"7577640","7583460"," And even remembering back Apple, remembering back Apple itself, right, as a company. "
"7584160","7586560"," Are they going to be looked, looked back upon favor?"
"7586820","7590720"," But you guys remember when like Microsoft and was, was kind of like the it, right?"
"7590840","7591640"," It was one of the things."
"7593960","7596920"," You remember when Petco is one of the things, right?"
"7597520","7599920"," You remember when all these companies, they have their moments."
"7600680","7602660"," How much staying power do they have?"
"7602660","7604880"," Are they the next generation?"
"7605680","7607580"," Is that is a guy that's like our woman?"
"7607700","7611860"," Let's say this woman is like 16 or 18 years old right now. "
"7612380","7616680"," When she's my age, when she's 35, 40, 50 years old."
"7617380","7623200"," Is she going to be saying rock on for another 20 years, Elon, I'm behind you."
"7623600","7628520"," Or is she going to have her own new hero that she's looking up to?"
"7628520","7631180"," So I'm an early Tesla adopter. "
"7631280","7632980"," I'm an early Tesla stock buyer."
"7633840","7638280"," And I remember at that time that no one liked Elon Musk."
"7638840","7643280"," Just like there's, there's a volatility around his name right now. "
"7643860","7647380"," At that time, there, no one liked Elon."
"7647920","7650340"," No one, and I mean nobody."
"7651100","7654200"," And I'm assuming that that's going to happen again for somebody else. "
"7654200","7663340"," Some young tech startup founder of some kind will be out there and people will say, no, he's never"
"7663340","7663880"," going anywhere."
"7664060","7665200"," She's never going anywhere."
"7665960","7668200"," So I'm looking for those companies right now. "
"7668400","7670260"," I'm looking for that next generation."
"7670660","7672460"," I'm looking for that next Elon Musk."
"7673660","7676000"," I want to know who that company is. "
"7676000","7679500"," They want to put some risk on probably 10 or 20 of these companies."
"7680300","7684620"," Now, or at least track some of these companies for that next generation."
"7684620","7691740"," It's kind of a disservice right now as a Tesla bull or a Tesla as a Tesla. "
"7694160","7695780"," What would you call it?"
"7695860","7697060"," I guess Tesla gang."
"7698520","7703500"," It's kind of a disservice to young people that just constantly scream into the echo chambers of"
"7703500","7706180"," social media and be like, it's only Elon."
"7706400","7707560"," It's only ever going to be Elon. "
"7707960","7708660"," And that's it."
"7709000","7709540"," End of story."
"7710040","7717040"," Because I know that was there when no one listened to Tesla and Elon Musk bulls when Tesla was a"
"7717040","7717600"," nothing company. "
"7719180","7720020"," That's the truth."
"7720720","7723440"," And those same people at that time were old people."
"7724720","7724860"," Right. "
"7725560","7728660"," So like when Elon was being looked up to and he was nothing nobody."
"7729020","7729860"," I guess he wasn't something."
"7730800","7734020"," We know he was already rich and a lot of the stuff and he had some shit going on with"
"7734020","7735960"," PayPal and stuff and company X."
"7736180","7744400"," But at that time frame, in that time period, a lot of old traders, a lot of old investors just"
"7744400","7749800"," destroyed early adopters of Elon Musk's companies. "
"7754910","7758250"," And to this day, some of those people still do."
"7758250","7758530"," Right."
"7760410","7766050"," So for myself, I'm like, yeah, you know, it's probably time to at least start to entertain. "
"7768250","7771270"," At least start to entertain the next 20 years."
"7773470","7775890"," Probably probably right around that time."
"7777470","7778930"," One second here. "
"7799200","7802520"," It's probably right around that time to start finding those, finding those companies."
"7803480","7808320"," As they mature as Elon as as as Tesla begins to mature somewhat."
"7808520","7810280"," I think Tesla's going to keep going up over the years. "
"7810940","7814100"," I've got full faith in Tesla and especially the people that work there."
"7816080","7818640"," They posted some, I posted some stuff."
"7820120","7821820"," Some articles on. "
"7822540","7824680"," Fintuit this morning about company X."
"7825940","7827680"," Some stuff from last year."
"7828620","7833020"," About company X and what like the buying of chips."
"7833840","7836380"," You know, Elon's saying you should pause, right?"
"7836500","7837760"," Elon's out there saying you should pause. "
"7838020","7843900"," They eye developments and yet he's buying 20, 30 million, 40 million dollars worth of chips in the"
"7843900","7846660"," background from Nvidia and video, baby."
"7847520","7848500"," Keep saying it."
"7848680","7849860"," Make you say it public. "
"7851540","7853860"," So the meantime, he's doing that stuff in the background."
"7854180","7855800"," This company is not public, right?"
"7856300","7857260"," Twitter is not public."
"7857480","7859820"," You have no way to make money from that. "
"7859920","7863480"," They want to start selling stocks on Twitter."
"7864600","7869800"," They're going to make a they're going to make a garden, a closed off garden, just like Apple has."
"7870840","7873000"," You're going to see five thumbs and kingdoms. "
"7874620","7878400"," In social media and they're going to be where you must."
"7879460","7884500"," Make all of your transactions and you're going to have this is what this is the plan."
"7885380","7891240"," Is that you're going to have instead of you use that while you're in recent memory used to have. "
"7892480","7894980"," Political parties and religious groups."
"7895680","7897360"," That formed your opinions."
"7898520","7905500"," You then you then you had the rise of corporations and TV networks that gave you a fed you your"
"7905500","7907720"," steady diet of what you shouldn't shouldn't buy. "
"7908620","7909980"," Directed you to stores."
"7910880","7912180"," Then you had the internet come along."
"7912600","7913720"," It was kind of a wild west. "
"7916560","7920720"," And just like what Google wants to do, just like what meta wants to do."
"7921280","7929040"," Elon's saying, okay, this is what I'm going to do."
"7930320","7931740"," This garden that I've created. "
"7932400","7933800"," You're going to buy your stocks through me."
"7934480","7936400"," You're going to pay your bills through me."
"7936820","7938540"," You're going to create your content through me. "
"7938880","7941080"," You're going to get your insurance through me."
"7942080","7945900"," I'm going to make a better meta or metaverse for you."
"7948910","7952450"," And I'm going to have my own I'm going to have my own AI. "
"7954690","7959570"," And instead of you getting your information from all these different places, you're going to get it"
"7959570","7960010"," from me."
"7960990","7963670"," Now, whether you agree or disagree with that, I don't know."
"7965710","7973150"," But I posted that stuff for you specifically because that company is not a publicly traded company. "
"7975290","7976970"," Let me bring this stuff over here."
"7986280","7990240"," And I want to know if you think there are other companies out there that are like that."
"7990940","7993240"," They're at that phase that are publicly traded. "
"7994400","7995460"," I don't mean meta."
"8006740","8011360"," I don't mean any Asian companies out there."
"8011380","8017460"," I wonder if you guys know of any young tech bros out there that are trying to create the same,"
"8017460","8018660"," the same fight them. "
"8019620","8021480"," Let me know in the comments if you do."
"8041830","8043910"," Giving in Mara and Riot calls every day."
"8050680","8052760"," Was there a so red drift?"
"8052760","8055720"," Was there a was there any news of the insider selling?"
"8057820","8058800"," Give news on that. "
"8061840","8063620"," No, we should go close this gap by Friday."
"8063620","8064360"," This one right here."
"8065080","8067660"," The gaps will be closed by the close Friday should be. "
"8080740","8082320"," Yeah, Twitter is a spruce goose."
"8087300","8088560"," Yeah, the Howard Hughes thing."
"8089420","8092300"," Yeah, that's a it's a tall order. "
"8093680","8095400"," It's a tall order for him to do."
"8098520","8102620"," It's it's scary, but it's scary that they're all doing it."
"8104420","8106580"," It's scary that they're it's scary. "
"8106760","8109440"," The only scary thing I find about it is."
"8112580","8115920"," There was like a contract with especially with democracies."
"8116220","8118960"," There was a contract where if you didn't like. "
"8121020","8123620"," If you didn't likely your government was speeding you or the propaganda."
"8123880","8126340"," You're being fed that you could vote these people out."
"8127560","8132360"," Not only could you vote those people out, you could make new laws to go after corporations or"
"8132360","8133580"," churches or whoever. "
"8134740","8138380"," There was some kind of there was this contract that was made with in democracies."
"8139440","8144760"," Director in direct democracies that you still had kind of this say whether you execute or."
"8145960","8149200"," Whether you did this or not or whether the democracy was built against you. "
"8151020","8153700"," Being able to make sudden changes but over time you could."
"8158260","8162120"," But I do find it fascinating that to this or that today."
"8163140","8165560"," I just thought mostly fascinating being older now. "
"8166980","8168440"," I do find it fascinating."
"8169760","8171060"," I get that squeeze going."
"8172200","8173100"," Squeeze it up there. "
"8174540","8187610"," Do you find it fascinating that that somewhere along"
"8187610","8190270"," the way we've said to ourselves I'm going to trust."
"8191469","8198889"," A wealthy person to feed me what I want my diet not even a not even a corporation just some"
"8198889","8200330"," smart person some smart."
"8200730","8203650"," Wealthy person out there I trust that person with my. "
"8206830","8208930"," With my context in life."
"8209889","8212209"," I just find that fascinating."
"8219250","8222969"," Now that that's what that's what that's what the next logical step. "
"8226580","8230379"," It's not just Elon doing it either right look at that big green balls baby."
"8231040","8232559"," Squeeze it higher right now."
"8240680","8242100"," That's supply up there. "
"8250020","8251360"," Squeeze it higher right now."
"8252760","8253940"," Let's find it fascinating."
"8284219","8286820"," Vicks coming down or test its lows right now. "
"8286820","8296320"," This is the lowest Vicks has been Vicks bloodbath and down 18 19 lowest its been since the 31st of"
"8296320","8296600"," March."
"8300600","8304860"," Or I scratch that since the third of March."
"8306139","8308400"," Lowest price since third of March. "
"8308740","8316100"," Previously we hit lows on the 15th of February and then if we're going to go even lower we're going"
"8316100","8317219"," to start to break these lows."
"8317219","8325480"," The next price target down below is $17.06. Do we do it today or do we do it tomorrow."
"8332139","8333139"," Ooh doggy. "
"8341580","8347440"," Ooh baby look at that squeeze higher right now slamming into our one trading for 10 92."

"10103690","10105550"," So Jerome Pierce just said. "
"10106150","10110410"," Remember yesterday when you said there were tons of calls and you were bearish for today."
"10111050","10116570"," So Jerome Pierce, you need to go back into my stream yesterday and watch my stream."
"10116810","10121970"," And I told you that I was bearish on yesterday and then any rip would be sold. "
"10123010","10129110"," And then I told you that I wasn't buying calls into the close because I wanted it to open to"
"10129110","10129990"," buy, right?"
"10130270","10130670"," Do you remember that?"
"10130930","10131750"," I think you forgot that."
"10132790","10134410"," I think you remember what you want to remember."
"10134650","10137130"," You probably what you did is you came in when you wanted to come in. "
"10138170","10139110"," That's what I would expect."
"10151990","10154510"," That's what I would expect."
"10154510","10158570"," I'm trying to throw it over down to the one minute right now. "

"10179230","10180290"," Yeah, it's short term memory. "
"10182830","10184530"," It's definitely a short term memory."
"10184530","10187510"," I think we spent the entire morning yesterday saying, right?"
"10189490","10191130"," Not to expect a big move in the day."
"10191250","10193170"," I think we spent hours on that yesterday. "
"10194070","10194990"," That's what I think though."
"10195150","10196450"," I think that's what it was spent on yesterday."

"10232090","10232550"," I don't know Chase. "
"10232830","10233690"," I'd be asking the VIX."
"10234790","10236290"," You probably want to trade futures."
"10238230","10242350"," If you're going to buy VIX, I'd probably trade futures and I might wait until Friday, man. "
"10245320","10248700"," The other thing too is I always like buying the VIX rather than calls."
"10249300","10249760"," Just buy them."
"10263210","10264150"," Do you copy that, Chase?"
"10280070","10281270"," Yeah, I trade VIX futures. "
"10283150","10284750"," Stay away from you, the XY2, Chase."
"10297780","10299200"," There's my cursor right over here."
"10302960","10303980"," Oh, yeah, look at that. "
"10304100","10304540"," There it is."

"10305940","10306580"," There it is. "
"10315990","10317190"," Four 12s or 31."
"10342370","10343050"," Yeah, I'm trying."
"10343210","10345150"," I'm looking at trying to get back in right now. "
"10346250","10347950"," As long as I'm getting ready to launch."
"10349330","10349910"," I don't."
"10350070","10350670"," I want to. "
"10350970","10352150"," So here, we'll take a look at some."
"10358610","10359830"," So the big question is."
"10362850","10364170"," We talked about this yesterday. "
"10364170","10364790"," We said."
"10366410","10368270"," This pre market high wasn't hit."
"10369410","10372070"," I don't know if we can get that high today. "
"10372310","10373510"," I think this one's on Friday."
"10374770","10376970"," I don't know that this is today."
"10377230","10377670"," Could be today. "
"10377870","10379510"," If they did it, if they did this one today."
"10381970","10385530"," I'm not going to expect higher on Friday if that's the case."
"10386690","10388310"," What I'd like to see would be. "
"10390090","10391890"," Still close this one up here."
"10392410","10393810"," Maybe this one right here."
"10394830","10397530"," I guess if you're a bull, this is what you're looking for at least this one. "
"10397610","10398510"," Maybe this one."
"10399830","10402370"," And then come back for this one on Friday."
"10407130","10409070"," But I still want to see this one get tagged. "
"10409090","10411710"," I want to see this weekly up here get tagged in cash market."
"10411890","10412650"," It hasn't happened yet."
"10416770","10419770"," That would get the VIX down there to that 17 or near the 17. "
"10421170","10423630"," I think or even if it gets the 18 or back to the 18."
"10425470","10427390"," I'll give us that cash market."
"10428870","10429810"," It hasn't hit this yet. "
"10430030","10432010"," Or at least this one is 4.12 we haven't hit yet."
"10434480","10437780"," I think earlier in the weekly earlier in the week was like 4.13 in change."
"10438220","10440560"," 4.13.50 or somewhere up in here. "
"10441320","10442000"," Still haven't hit it."
"10452750","10455570"," Come back down and retest the one in the five minute right now."
"10460180","10463100"," Bears don't like giving up that that $18 man. "
"10463260","10471440"," The $18.13. Didn't want to see that 17 again."
"10472800","10473840"," We just hit."
"10474120","10475100"," We just hit. "
"10484260","10485260"," Oh, I see."
"10493890","10495410"," When I got to take care of some."
"10500450","10501670"," Or didn't know that. "
"10537890","10539290"," 4.12 sees."
"10540130","10544390"," I kind of want to buy this, but I don't want the Swift reversal."
"10544390","10547210"," I don't want like the buy this and then boom. "
"10547390","10548350"," There it goes down there."
"10557820","10559300"," Let's go to the five minute really quick."
"10560400","10563420"," No, no, no joy for bears in here, huh?"
"10565860","10568620"," Retest down below in the one minute on the five minute charts. "
"10568740","10569620"," Bullishes fuck."
"10577120","10578160"," Bullishes fuck."
"10580540","10581820"," Sell the fucking VIX. "
"10586110","10588650"," Sell that fucking VIX down in the depths of hell."
"10591610","10592510"," Grind higher."
"10592970","10594090"," Just close both gaps. "
"10594410","10595410"," Here's another one back here."
"10599460","10600660"," There's another one."
"10606500","10608040"," I'm long right now, by the way. "
"10622540","10643900"," 4.1186, 4.1147. This"
"10643900","10644880"," was the tell right here."
"10652100","10653560"," VIX dying right now."
"10655160","10656360"," VIX trained 1808. "
"10658060","10659780"," VIX getting smashed right now."
"10663280","10673070"," Coming back, VIX coming back down to another previous low here at $18.11. We got the big"
"10673070","10674190"," bad boy down there."
"10674290","10676490"," Way down there at 1706. "
"10678630","10680410"," That's the big bad boy down there."
"10689080","10690900"," VIX capitulating right now."
"10707450","10722370"," Yeah, retail"
"10722370","10724870"," sales tomorrow has more event involved in PPI today. "
"10724870","10726950"," I was told PPI today had more event involved."
"10728530","10730770"," I think someone said that in chat yesterday."
"10734150","10743640"," Someone's like, PPI has more event involved in, I think, of course, PPI. "
"10744060","10745620"," Someone's like, CPI's got event ball."
"10746940","10753500"," Someone said, PPI's got more event involved in CPI."
"10755400","10758120"," I'm being told that tomorrow's retail sales has more event ball. "
"10759680","10768280"," My assumption would be, if we closed all this bullshit above today, I bet retail sales does have"
"10768280","10768960"," more event ball."
"10770540","10775860"," My assumption would be that, oh, yeah, blind nest out."

"10778740","10780240"," Look at all you guys subscribing out there."
"10780760","10782060"," I just want to, yeah, I forgot about that."
"10783520","10785940"," So, Jesus, who's doing that?"
"10785940","10789560"," It's a holy croissant, baby, gifting tier one subs. "
"10790480","10792000"," Winky was telling me this morning."
"10792200","10794420"," He was like, every month you have to go and tell people."
"10795400","10797880"," And I was like, I don't know how to ask these people this to do this. "
"10798320","10798800"," Hold on."
"10798940","10799760"," I don't know how to do this."
"10800980","10805620"," You have to, uh, one month subscriptions. "
"10806840","10809700"," I have to ask every month for you to subscribe again through prime."
"10810340","10817180"," Every month ask you to subscribe through prime so that you take $2.50 away from our man, Jeff"
"10817180","10817620"," Bezos."
"10818020","10819460"," It's a free thing for you to do. "
"10819540","10820840"," Subscribe to the channel on Twitch."
"10822220","10828680"," You have to subscribe every single month so you can steal $2.50 away from my man."
"10828920","10829740"," Bezos out there. "
"10829840","10831200"," And it helps to support the channel."

"10834840","10836600"," It only costs Bezos."
"10837820","10841260"," And it gives the channel $2.50 a month."
"10841260","10847160"," So if you're a Twitch subscriber, you're probably coming into your monthly subscription. "
"10848200","10854600"," So if you like these streams, this is, of course, a free, free sub."
"10855160","10857040"," We have a free discord."

"18493660","18504030"," so I've got some runners on for R2 before the close right now if you're"
"18504030","18513990"," questioning is this the role here I don't know maybe maybe you know 413 39 we've"
"18513990","18521590"," got 415 on deck for expected weekly move as of last of this past Monday we've never filled that"
"18521590","18527930"," that range part of the range we've filled our lower end already we haven't filled our upper upper"
"18527930","18533530"," upper side of that expected range for the week so weekly range we still haven't we're close like"
"18533530","18537750"," fourth I think it was 4 12 4 13 at one point on Monday and then it went up to"
"18537750","18543310"," like 4 15 buying a day or something like that if I recall I cannot recall this maybe exactly so"
"18543310","18551930"," it's getting it's getting there it's getting to that point um expectations for tomorrow we should"
"18551930","18557110"," talk about right now then the day it's 229 remember like 220 in the afternoon I say in the day"
"18557110","18563310"," we get kind of kind of soft in here sometimes between 220 to 43 p.m. so I wouldn't be"
"18563310","18571310"," surprised here so we can weaken this in this time period between 220 to 40 so we get weakness then"
"18571310","18577030"," like we will get weak like 250 and then we get our quote unquote power hour right so if we"
"18577030","18581730"," get weak in here don't don't fret about it and be like oh yeah why are we really weak right"
"18581730","18586970"," now should happens every day and we when we trend all day long this happens during every day I must"
"18586970","18595570"," be aware of that on a weekly basis I deleted the orange and yellow lines this morning they were on"
"18595570","18599870"," there we first opened but then I got rid of them so you guys could see better but you can"
"18599870","18603770"," just see in our weekly a few things need to look at so going into Friday there's a bunch of"
"18603770","18612170"," stuff we have to look at so it's a monthly here and what can we decipher from here"
"18612170","18622490"," we know some stuff I talked to you earlier today about 397"
"18622490","18630790"," 396 394 I talked to you about any weakness that we have any weakness this is the daily trigger"
"18630790","18636210"," right here but even if we were to trade down below and we closed the gap and we're able to"
"18636210","18645920"," remain above on this daily trigger trend is still to the upside another"
"18649540","18656100"," thing to be thinking about right now specifically is we've got some bank earnings starting and we"
"18656100","18665500"," have a traditional area of weakness in the market and that is we got here 13th"
"18665500","18679650"," 14th there we go Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday we have"
"18679650","18688490"," some weakness you 19th 20th 21st we have a spreads that the banks want to print we have monthly"
"18688490","18695970"," OPEC's got ER season I wouldn't know if I'd call it weekly would know if I'd call it weekly week"
"18695970","18705830"," or monthly weakness just an expectation heading into monthly OPEC's that we get pinned we also know"
"18705830","18714070"," about the JPM caller we're now one month into the JPM caller right we also know that you may or"
"18714070","18721210"," may not know this you may or may not know this but the JPM caller we print that first side"
"18721210","18728090"," of the JPM caller and we have the market is now free to do whatever it wants from this point"
"18728090","18732770"," forward we know that the we know that the JPM caller frees the market to do whatever it wants the"
"18732770","18739050"," magnets don't mean shit down below they don't mean shit because the downside protection is now paid"
"18739050","18748570"," for so so JPM is now hedged JPM now hedged JPM"
"18748570","18754810"," callers higher than it was once before I got a bunch of shit for that on Twitter JPM callers lower"
"18754810","18762690"," range is higher than it was last quarter JPM is now hedged to the downside for free train is paid"
"18762690","18770650"," for we're not near those magnets down below so they're not as attractive as they should be we also"
"18770650","18779350"," know that there will be some stifling of upward moves now that that caller is printed right there"
"18779350","18785710"," there'll be like it's not quite a magnet but it's a anytime bulls will have like a resistance to"
"18785710","18794450"," going higher I should say so we should have like lower volatility as time passes so just into this"
"18794450","18803490"," this monthly OPEC cycle this is all good to see this is your R3415 above here would not be shocked"

"19238930","19251750"," or tomorrow either way I'm gonna throw money at it yeah be"
"19251750","19257530"," a red rabbit saying swoosh after hours and green by morning puts never print yeah that's my thing"
"19257530","19262790"," if you're if you're bearish into this ER season I would say to you like put spreads are probably"
"19262790","19270730"," better in the money shit and just walk away and take your money and run or a ratio spread it's"
"19270730","19275630"," really hard to be like it's really hard to be like correct even as even as bull doesn't matter"
"19275630","19283010"," fucking bull or bear directly trading directly trading the stock that you you'll have you'll"
"19283010","19287410"," there's a few of them right you're like every four or five big reports you'll have a huge bloodbath"
"19287410","19292690"," you'll have a huge face river that does print but you can easily blow up an account just trying to"
"19292690","19300450"," fuck around that stuff easy ER seasons like a really good way to make like one out of five calls"
"19300450","19305550"," right or three out of five calls right and still be upside down or at least for me I've had"
"19305550","19311010"," some good experiences but some really bad ones I've had better experiences trading through ER"
"19311010","19317010"," season when we're in a highly liquid environment I've had less success in an ill liquid environment"
"19317010","19330880"," there's less room for for for being not exactly accurate we do"
"19330880","19335480"," it I do so if you guys want man if you guys any guys that have just been following me"
"19335480","19342180"," the past six months or so tell you've been here since day one I draw in the expected move and"
"19342180","19346920"," then I draw in what I where I think it's going and we almost hit it to a tick strike"
"19346920","19352460"," every time like to a tick where I think it's going like gonna tag that it's gonna tag that like"
"19352460","19359720"," over and we have videos that shit like boom boom boom so the other idea would be if you want"
"19359720","19365000"," to trade it you can trade it by owning the under underlying and be able to sell at those at"
"19365000","19372240"," those tech strikes we do trade individual tickers during earning season but it's like you buy the"
"19372240","19377160"," underlying and you you sell the under you sell if you're selling for a low-tech strike you want to"
"19377160","19385900"," short it down there you can do something like that too but generally speaking what what gets fucked"
"19385900","19395630"," is the underlying option for next day like just naked shit"
"19395630","19405490"," I tend to trade him with with the triggers I use the triggers for"

"19458210","19465870"," I see a lot of work for four twenty I see a lot of work for thirty there is a"
"19465870","19473800"," capitulation phase though I'll show you that if you want to see it there is a bear capitulation"
"19473800","19479680"," phase but it's a ton of work like you have to there's a bear capitulation phase but it is a"
"19479680","19489560"," ton of work like it's not today there has to be like a breakout from the downtrend there"
"19489560","19499440"," has to be a a successful defense go above the previous high of that breakout you do that"
"19499440","19507560"," it gets it gets it goes straight up it goes straight that's that's when you all all shorts get"
"19508400","19514320"," triggered and we just we just go straight to fuck up it's like non-stop straight up they would look"
"19514320","19524090"," something like so"
"19524090","19533550"," SPX I'm not saying this is gonna happen but we're almost there you need like"
"19533550","19543160"," we're almost fucking there right that's kind of it isn't it that's kind of it right"
"19543160","19549820"," this is a successful defense right maybe you're right man I could be wrong here I mean here's SPX"
"19549820","19558420"," this is a successful defense isn't it hold on I guess you know what maybe I'm wrong"
"19558420","19565380"," maybe I'm wrong man this is like one more thing to add in the cap for bulls I'll show you"
"19565380","19571100"," this I didn't look at this I don't normally I'll put them up but I don't really look at them"
"19571100","19578920"," I don't like pull out a weight in this stuff I do do an extent but I never look for"
"19578920","19584820"," this stuff like I'm not ever focused on this stuff but I will tell you this I will show this"
"19584820","19592880"," in SPX at least this is real when you have a move like this and you get the high and"
"19592880","19601680"," you get the successful defense of the downward channel if you break I want you to understand this"
"19601680","19611570"," if you break this high right here you typically gets mass capitulation"
"19611570","19615690"," moves it gets very violent to the upside"
"19615690","19625390"," very very and it can move like nobody's"
"19625390","19631210"," business and this right here I'll be honest with you that right there is very bullish or at least"
"19631210","19637530"," traditionally this is very bullish this structure this is a key point right here this this dip"
"19637530","19646590"," being bought and then if you break above this right here all this stuff says we're going that way"
"19646590","19656570"," in a big big way big it's as"
"19656570","19666270"," bullish as it can be it can't be any more bullish than that well I guess it could it would"
"19666270","19673330"," be like this you'd have the initial breakout you'd back test it once more if anybody knows what"
"19673330","19682630"," this stuff looks like some of you guys know what this looks like some of you guys know about the"
"19682630","19689730"," phase you would have you'd break out above come back and do the retest on the trough and this would"
"19689730","19694590"," be the most bullish right here this would be like the now we have had moments where it's been a"
"19694590","19700890"," false breakout and this is where the bloodbath comes in and you guys any guys out there that are"
"19700890","19706730"," that study charts and and TA and stuff like that know about this stuff this would be the bull the"
"19706730","19714650"," really big bull's trade we have had moments though where this has been a false breakout but this is"
"19714650","19723290"," what it's looking like if you guys don't know anything about corrections that's what it would look"
"19723290","19740130"," like brother you guys"
"19740130","19749450"," know what that stuff looks like you guys know what you guys know what corrective patterns look like"
"19749450","19757210"," and once they're complete what happens it looks like it looks like the melt up and"
"19757210","19767550"," you kick you drag the you drag them kicking and screaming basically you drag"
"19767550","19773790"," sellers kicking it they give every last dollar back every last dollar give it all back millions"
"19773790","19782010"," millions you actually you actually we talked about this right you'll actually see a string of hedge"
"19782010","19786150"," funds that not just hedge funds like a desk that it has to like right now like have to be"
"19786150","19793990"," short of a short market all the time and put like one two three four years passes and they get"
"19793990","19797710"," blown up they don't have a choice like I'm fucking short this market and it's like too much time"
"19797710","19802870"," being short and they get run the fuck over and you got like 30 40 of these companies that they"
"19802870","19812500"," close up shop they do they close up shop hedge funds are risky business I have a lot of respect"
"19812500","19817240"," for hedge funds I know I know I fuck with hedge funds all the time but it's a very risky"
"19817240","19822200"," risky big big green bars in here it's a very risky business you I think it's like a 50%"
"19822200","19827480"," attrition rate normally in these situations when they blow up where they have to constantly be sell"
"19827480","19849010"," side you're like everything says you have to be sell side if you're"
"19849010","19855190"," if you're I'm assuming that there's chart is out there right now just looking at that briefly I'm"
"19855190","19860750"," gonna assume there's some chart is out there looking at where we are today and they're watching it"
"19860750","19871570"," closely because there is a door above there's a doorway above you can't"
"19871570","19878870"," say it's not there doesn't mean it happens just that that doorway is right there and you can't give"
"19878870","19884930"," it to the bulls yet either right so you can't say the bulls we're going to 460 right now because"
"19884930","19891650"," they still have work they have to break above it they have to then retest that high but once they"
"19891650","19898250"," retest that high if there's no role it's fucking on you will see everybody say we're in a new bull"
"19898250","19908250"," market at that point then you would see money you would see liquidity rush back in"
"19908250","19915130"," here I'll show it two more times so if you wanted to see like liquidity rush back into the market"
"19915130","19923580"," I'll show exactly what it would look like and I'm not talking about the big prime banks they won't"
"19923580","19929440"," they won't re-enter they'll enter at the end but you would see something like this if money was to"
"19929440","19935980"," re-enter the market I'd more than likely look like something like this a failure right about there"
"19935980","19943840"," and then something like this and then we're off and running something like that I have to look at"
"19943840","19954070"," this more closely but it would be something like this there's a"
"19954070","19963250"," seven eight nine seven eight nine nine ten where's ten where's summer five six seven"
"19963250","19968230"," you'd have I can I should make this better I gotta do this by the month hold on a second"
"19968230","19978290"," here I need to look for some seasonally low places here I"
"19978290","19993190"," have to do some work here first but October November that"
"19993190","19997470"," doesn't even really matter does it like all this little stuff doesn't mean shit like a pullback and"
"19997470","20004590"," and like this pullback in April doesn't mean shit um I just need it just literally just needs to"
"20004590","20011490"," get there you can easily come back down here come back up here like like in smaller time frames you"
"20011490","20015290"," can do that you can come back down have your bloodbath down here you can close this shit up doesn't"
"20015290","20021830"," matter but this kind of stuff like a smaller time frame you know this seasonal bloodbath down here"
"20021830","20026490"," and then you're starting to rock a ship higher into December maybe you have your melt up or"
"20026490","20030770"," something like that I'm kind of fucking this up for you right now but if we weren't doing all these"
"20030770","20034930"," goofy fucking lines just like one or two three lines you probably have some some kind of a move"
"20034930","20041810"," like look at that some kind of a move like that down down and you're off and running right there"
"20041810","20047750"," something like that you're clearing all this all these gaps down here you'd be looking for that"
"20047750","20053110"," support and you're proving that this is over over here you're getting higher higher four thirty"
"20053110","20059810"," four sixty or four forty maybe four sixty back here in the year and in this time period you'd see"
"20059810","20064630"," people buying these dips this would be liquidity reentering the system and then the mass liquidity"
"20064630","20070950"," would come in towards end of year people putting money to work that would be it right there that's"
"20070950","20077190"," if this had this plays itself out on a larger a larger time frame it looks kind of like where"
"20077190","20085830"," it kind of looks like this they were off and running and that's successful defense right there and"
"20085830","20095730"," that was your low right there that was your trough right there now is your"
"20095730","20110050"," capitulation phase now trading for 1361 I'm sure"
"20110050","20115390"," artists are out there looking at that right now because if there is a failure then that's the other"
"20115390","20121910"," part here's the other part I'm sure that Ellie wavers looking at this because I'm going to assume"
"20121910","20127590"," that L.A. wavers are like if I was an L.A. waver I would say if there's a failure"
"20127590","20136610"," up here trend is over that's all bullshit rip it up and we're going to weigh three wave three is"
"20136610","20140310"," over we're going to head back down to the depths hell that's that's what I would think I think that"
"20140310","20143810"," L.A. wavers probably going to say it but might take all year long but we're going down for the"
"20143810","20151510"," rest of this day now I also think in L.A. wavers going to say but if we break above"
"20151510","20161030"," right here targets above 460 reversal back down a test and test right where we are 420 415 420"
"20161030","20168430"," it'll be an area that we revisit if that holds we might close some gaps but they're all viable"
"20168430","20178180"," we're heading off to a bull market a bull run not a market bull run trading"
"20185540","20193760"," 413 61 trying to close the gap at 413 75 right now more liquidity above my head that yellow bar"

"20722440","20728140"," houses and this shit just sold off sold off and sold off this is very similar where we are right"
"20728140","20733580"," now in the market pretty similar to where Tesla is in the market and they got that final dip down"
"20733580","20739180"," there and they they told themselves never fucking do that again and they have not bought here yet"
"20739180","20747260"," they didn't buy this down here we went down a hundred bucks now this is today not back here we"

"20850880","20860000"," hundred bucks they want to buy 65 down here so they're not on your side so"
"20860000","20867560"," with that said in this light volume down here you still have a good chance of a squeeze here so"

"23400430","23407150"," for sure that people have a lot of money riding on not two things we know that people have money"
"23407150","23414310"," riding on XLF in the reports that we have in the morning we didn't discuss when banks report on"
"23414310","23424170"," weekends or like most most most companies will report their normal hours and if they switch let's"
"23424170","23431850"," say to like a Friday or not Friday like a end of end of the week or at the end"
"23431850","23439050"," of the day the reports typically are meant for people to digest and sometimes can be very negative"
"23439050","23444330"," they normally report at a different time period it's not their regular reschedule thing I do find"
"23444330","23450050"," it kind of savage but on a Friday morning that a bank is trying to report it's gonna give you"
"23450050","23458130"," an entire day of trading to decide where those banks go so if they're not normally doing it when"
"23458130","23462250"," they don't normally I thought Tuesday Wednesday Thursday was normal bank reports well a large banks"
"23462250","23470430"," at least so seeing it on a Friday is unusual I don't know what that means for tomorrow for JPM"
"23470430","23476710"," in this instance personally I don't know I know they've had a bad reports in the past recently I'm"
"23476710","23484290"," gonna hope that Jamie Diamond in my view is trying to be portrayed as a statesman that saved"
"23484290","23492530"," regional banks so I think they're gonna give him some love on that I think they are so I'm I'm"
"23492530","23498310"," bullish on tomorrow on on XLF or at least JPM specifically I'm kind of bullish not crazy bullish"
"23498310","23508230"," just bullish enough and for tomorrow my thoughts on tomorrow is that we do trade I do believe"
"23508230","23514790"," that we trade 415 before the end of the week if we don't trade 415 tomorrow into Friday if you"
"23514790","23522870"," get a bad report from XLF I'd be looking to erase this entire move here down a 411 so if"
"23522870","23528210"," you did like it let's say you're if you're trading XLF right now you could put another side to this"
"23528210","23536130"," on like some 411's a piece for tomorrow for Friday as a counter hedge to that trade if you were"
"23536130","23543130"," gonna bloodbath it down tomorrow I do agree with bears that next week we are next if you want to"
"23543130","23550130"," put a trade over next week we are we are almost always on a bullish March April week the third"
"23550130","23558770"," week of April you have a high probability heading into next week of us being weak in the market"
"23558770","23566250"," side like sideways and down slowly down into next week so so that if I was a bear that's like"
"23566250","23573290"," yeah hey we went up March and April third week of April bears show us on so like John Hagerty's"
"23573290","23590760"," in here saying I'm short it it's the logical probable probable thing to do into next week yeah yeah"
"23590760","23598660"," yeah I think we close for 15 tomorrow I think we do we might do it I'd be fascinated to"
"23598660","23604100"," see if we did it with a cell before the opening bell that would piss me off I'd be pretty"
"23604100","23608780"," fucking angry like you hit 415 in the pre-market and then they're just like see you and that's"
"23608780","23620730"," where the cell is actually at that's where the future cell is so I'm fascinated by that too when"
"23620730","23630410"," role answer that question for you I've we discussed it this morning at March"
"23630410","23636290"," I am going to the the role should take place next week it's a matter of you picking a high"
"23636290","23642430"," to do it I was expecting 413 on Friday at the latest we got it today so if you want"
"23642430","23647690"," it today this is it right we got it a day early the expected move early in the week on"
"23647690","23652430"," Monday was 415 I'm gonna assume that there's some bulls out there that think we might still go up"
"23652430","23657690"," there into Friday close I'm not short the market right now so I've got some lotos on right here"
"23657690","23664710"," I've got some I've got a small I've got a IWM calls out there but that's for summer time that's"
"23664710","23672270"," just trying to capture all the premium for the small cap reports as they roll into the market but I"
