"69580","71700"," Yeah, that's right."
"71700","72680"," Good morning, Daddy."
"74480","75580"," What up, Winky?"
"76440","77460"," Good morning, everybody. "
"77920","78560"," Pays on."
"79240","81040"," Hell yes in the house, kid."
"81840","82420"," Time. "
"83180","83800"," James Andreas."
"85120","87860"," Binky's in the house, Devin's in here, unexpected visit."
"88260","88260"," Woo. "
"88440","88920"," Good morning."
"92340","93280"," Here we go."
"94140","94640"," Good morning, everybody. "
"94900","95400"," How's everybody doing?"
"96580","97900"," Thanks for joining us again."
"97900","99660"," I appreciate y'all being here every morning, of course."
"101400","104380"," More in Garrett, more in Ryan, more in Shitzlamer. "
"106860","108160"," Good morning, Shitzlamer."
"108320","108640"," How are you?"
"111060","113780"," Morning, everybody."
"114020","122580"," Happy Thanksgiving if you're in the U.S. If you're not, hopefully you can enjoy your weekend as"
"122580","122760"," well. "
"125040","129039"," It's time for us to get together with our families and friends if we have any or not to and"
"129039","129800"," be alone."
"130380","131440"," Sometimes people are happier."
"134760","135700"," Good morning, Satcha. "
"135800","136320"," Good morning, Jess."
"138300","139560"," Yeah, good morning, Shitzlamer."
"140580","141320"," Morning, Satcha. "
"141500","143920"," Good morning, Pat, man, AA, AAA."
"145180","147380"," All the way to the mayor's."
"147460","148540"," Good morning, Patrick Thomas. "
"151980","152740"," Good to see you, Bink."
"156300","158900"," Yeah, or when does Vix go to zero?"
"159440","161620"," People have got to be freaking out this morning, right?"
"162700","164360"," What's the only thing that's bad, Pat?"
"165220","166000"," Morning, Mario."
"166000","167940"," Good morning, ATown, Metamorphic Morning. "
"168420","169100"," How's everybody doing?"
"170320","173040"," So I guess that by the dip was right yesterday on Tesla, right?"
"174860","180640"," It was a lead, I guess a lag, or an indicator of what was pinning the market."
"182580","189220"," The hold up on that, and then, of course, Tesla, this morning is doing quite well, it seems."
"190700","192140"," So we'll swing right over there right now. "
"193120","194820"," Let's turn that off and get right into it."
"195420","196240"," I've only got a few minutes left."
"198320","199880"," 9.22, you get eight minutes to the opening bell. "
"201340","202180"," Now we're going to open right up here."
"202540","204300"," Just want to briefly go over a few things with you."
"206380","208680"," What's going on, a larger time frame here real quick. "
"212350","216470"," You know, I was trying to look at this last night again and again and again."
"218970","220970"," Well, first off, last night I got stuck."
"221330","228030"," I have a tenet that left me a voicemail message yesterday saying that their furnace was off. "
"228370","231050"," And of course, that's going to cost me a couple of grand, and I'm like, I don't want to fucking"
"231050","231470"," pay that."
"232830","238490"," So I pulled off the induction motor and it was dry, so clean that up or whatever."
"239850","241090"," Let's just take a quick look, okay. "
"241490","243450"," I mean, there's a couple ways to look at this, right?"
"244010","247310"," We know we have volatility coming in, but a couple of things I don't need to know before they open"
"247310","247530"," here."
"249770","254710"," And, you know, we're in positive, whenever you see this pivot, that pivot point that I post every"
"254710","259649"," day, that's pretty much a positive and negative, well, intraday positive and negative gamma."
"260550","264630"," This morning, the pivot point lowered, and we bounced right off at this morning. "
"265330","269750"," I have to get my daughter to post that stuff early in the morning so that you guys have like"
"269750","273670"," seven in the morning, because you could have, you could have seen this morning, right?"
"273810","275970"," When we opened, that we were going up."
"278390","282470"," And we were in positive gamma, where we slip in and out of it, but we're in positive gamma, so"
"282470","286390"," we haven't, we're going to have a tendency for supportive markets."
"286750","287550"," I just want to be aware of that. "
"287690","289050"," We're in a supportive market right now."
"289050","292810"," We talked about it yesterday and we are in a supportive market."
"292810","294010"," That means you buy the dip. "
"294250","297690"," If there's a dip you buy, there's a dip you buy, not sell the rip."
"298070","302030"," Now, once we get up, the call wall is somewhere up here."
"302390","303670"," This is where R3 was yesterday. "
"304850","308430"," It is now further down today."
"309190","315170"," So we have some compression going on, and we likely have a sell the rip somewhere today around 390."
"316210","317310"," We'll get a little bit smaller. "
"317750","320430"," So we should be, we should be seeing something like this."
"321930","327830"," And then some volatility, of course, tomorrow, and then a decision, or a pause somewhere in here at"
"327830","330050"," this pivot point, and then a move higher or lower."
"330730","331690"," We're just going to kind of suck. "
"332490","336490"," So even if we get a move today higher, which makes sense, if you're going to short the market into"
"336490","342910"," tomorrow and you're a bank, if you're trying to do tax loss harvest, Tesla, or anything, any other"
"342910","346510"," kicker that you're going to tax loss harvest this year, you're going to take your finger off the"
"346510","348290"," scale and try to get the best price that you can."
"348370","349510"," That's what distribution is, right?"
"349510","353410"," You sell selling high until you get to a predetermined number."
"353610","358670"," We saw it in Tesla yesterday that the banks were selling or algorithms were selling it. "
"358870","360830"," It was perfect level to level to level."
"361970","365090"," So you'll probably see something like that today as well, right?"
"365650","369390"," They're taking their finger off of the pressure on the market."
"369650","370890"," They don't care about the VIX. "
"370950","372990"," VIX bulls got to be pissed this morning without a doubt."
"373710","375930"," But this is like textbook stuff right here."
"376030","377210"," We've got five minutes off to the open. "
"378470","383770"," So do you think that we trade up here, watching my cursor up to this 406 level today?"
"384290","384870"," Is it possible?"
"385650","387110"," Yeah, I guess it can be possible."
"387550","388290"," I'm going to get rid of that."
"389410","393170"," I'm going to get rid of that because this line is now gone as well. "
"394930","395950"," Let's get rid of all that."
"396130","401730"," But the implied move today is only up to about 397.8, 397.8 somewhere in there."
"403030","404810"," So we put a little red box in here. "
"405290","407590"," And I'm not going to expect us to trade any higher than that."
"407890","410170"," We could even trade sideways right off the bell here."
"410290","415050"," When we hit this bell, we could squeeze up and then trade sideways and down the rest of the day. "
"415730","420750"," So you'll see the markets be supportive probably the rest of today and then await the Fed meeting"
"420750","423970"," coming into tomorrow."
"424610","426790"," So let's take a look at that on a smaller time frame here."
"428110","429850"," Weebles kind of acting kind of wonky. "
"429850","432090"," We have a previous high above at 39702."
"433250","437930"," We'll switch over to book map as we come into this open as well so you can take a look"
"437930","438190"," at that."
"438910","440650"," And you'll see there's sellers right above us. "
"441170","445450"," You can see we've got some, let me see if I can bring my thing over here."
"446550","455230"," You've got some resistance here right at 397 9.50. That's about at 3967 7."
"455230","460210"," And then just above that we have some more sellers at 3984."
"461310","464170"," That looks like the previous high that we have marked off on the chart. "
"466050","467670"," And then we'll look slightly higher here."
"477720","484080"," We actually have some that call wall above at 4,000."
"484260","485460"," That's at 3900. "
"485580","486280"," That's actually forming."
"486580","487600"," We didn't have that yesterday."
"487860","490580"," So there might be some implication that we could trade higher today. "
"490580","493840"," But just taking a look you'll see there's some immediate selling off the bell."
"494300","500700"," So my thought would be that off this bell this morning we're going to reject and then trade down"
"500700","503060"," and try to find support at 3970."
"503420","506160"," Just by looking at the at book map or at the bell. "
"506500","507880"," We could squeeze right through it at the bell."
"509000","516179"," This chain or spot or book map will change immediately after some volume comes into the market."
"516500","523039"," But what we'll do is we'll look for I'm going to hope for now when we have these opens and"
"523039","529280"," we're already up here right instead of buying the dip here we'll come over here. "
"529840","533440"," When I'm hoping we get right over I guess if you're a bull what you're hoping for this is our"
"533440","538740"," one is you're going to be looking for you're going to hope we get this down here to make this"
"538740","542600"," leg up higher right today and then hopefully sell this."
"543420","545480"," That would be the bull case for today."
"546860","555340"," The theta case for today would be to buy some wide butterflies and sell them by end of day right"
"555340","559580"," and that would be where we do a quick rip reject off the previous closing high. "
"559960","563820"," And then we do this bullshit awaiting tomorrow right."
"564320","567400"," That's the theta that's theta gang kind of trade for the day today."
"568160","575240"," And then the bear trade for today is of course we open slam off our two or even here these"
"575240","579960"," these would be these two levels that are that was on book map and we just start trading it down"
"579960","586820"," in sideways and down into the known volatility that's coming to the market tomorrow for the"
"586820","587120"," minutes. "
"587720","590360"," And if I have some time today I'm going to take a quick break."
"591560","594880"," I haven't had yesterday I got caught up with some stuff I had to do last night."
"594980","601720"," I got done with streaming yesterday and I had ECB synthesis as a recession on its own won't solve"
"601720","606400"," inflation issues and says the ECB will take interest rates to restrictive levels. "
"606800","608220"," This is premature to pick the next."
"608600","612900"," Had some issues with attendance and then I had some issues with dinner last night."
"613760","618560"," A very rare occurrence that we had a bad dinner and had to get a different dinner and then you"
"618560","620600"," know as the night I've got children all that kind of stuff. "
"621360","626680"," So but I do want to get a chart for you or look at a chart at some point this"
"626680","630380"," morning that shows you we don't always sell the minutes."
"630500","637720"," Sometimes we do about 90 percent of the time we sell the minutes we buy the the meeting."
"639020","643920"," So I guess the my my thought process would be let's just look we have got how many we got"
"643920","644500"," 30 seconds. "
"646880","650300"," My thought process here as we open let's watch and see what happens in the open."
"651120","660580"," But my thought process here is that we sell the minutes and then or my my original thought process"
"660580","666720"," was that we would sell the minutes excuse me we would buy the minutes and then we would sell the"
"666720","667780"," J-POW talk."
"668100","676480"," I thought the J-POW talk was tomorrow somehow somewhere someone I don't know if I misread it but"
"676480","681240"," they were talking about let me go put up my trip my thing because I might want to take a"
"681240","681660"," trade here. "
"683180","686960"," Somehow I thought that J-POW was going to talk during these minutes because it was Thanksgiving."
"687860","695800"," But he's not he is not talking I believe until Friday so that I had misinformation or I read my"
"695800","698000"," information wrong a couple days ago."
"699180","709040"," My initial thought was that the the minutes would actually be dovish and so we've got some"
"709040","714140"," calls coming in right off the belt 397c a couple thousand calls rolling in right away. "
"714140","717780"," I don't know if we're going to buy that because you're going to hold that for just a few moments"
"717780","718760"," if we keep ripping higher."
"723400","727300"," I'm going to wait I would wait for a dip or I'm going to wait for a dip just but"
"727300","734000"," a my initial thought was that the minutes would be dovish and we would get initial rip off it and"
"734000","739040"," then J-POW come out and talk and tone it down right sell the market."
"740480","749240"," But if we're going to get the minutes tomorrow and then J-POW on Friday I wonder if we get"
"749240","757760"," that volatility into the minutes the minutes look dovish we get the rip up into Friday where we"
"757760","763760"," close Wednesday for Thanksgiving on the high and then J-POW comes back in and"
"763760","773740"," shits on the at least the first or somewhere in there and try to hold a"
"773740","781480"," hold that 385 or whatever that wherever that is more of the highest and it's weird we have a we"
"781480","791320"," have some mixed signals on oscillators some very mixed signals and people are taking sides"
"791320","799880"," on oscillators this is looking down the road so you get the call side now switch the algos have now"
"799880","807740"," switched to the put side pretty fast action going on in the options chain right now let's look at a"
"807740","817240"," larger time frame here so we've got a 23rd 24th 25th right and I think we've got J-POW coming"
"817240","828540"," out on the 25th and talking here we'll put we'll put this one up here this"
"828540","834180"," is when you try to I'm trying to anticipate the news before it happens right you try you guys all"
"834180","840660"," you guys all love the news and stuff but the reality is you're looking for where the market is when"
"840660","849560"," the news comes out and how it's how it's implied to move the market before it happens right so my"
"849560","857260"," point would be that you get some kind of a lead in and some some doom into the meeting uh"
"857260","864600"," it actually did dovish in the initial reaction is good we rip higher into um Friday and then J-POW"
"864600","870940"," just shifts on the market and it's next week is heading into the first over here somewhere in here"
"870940","880760"," um so it'd be something like this and then we have a decision coming into uh the"
"880760","888000"," first right the first would give that uh do we have a more Christmas rally tax loss harvesting into"
"888000","894880"," end of year something like this I'm not not as concerned yet but uh there is some interest"
"894880","901800"," interesting things here if something like this were to play out my point to you is that if any of"
"901800","908200"," this were to play out here and we're able to get up and over 400 into the first of the"
"908200","915820"," year that would put like 430 440 on the table which is I don't can't believe I'm saying that I"
"918090","927810"," can't because I I can't see us going there I feel like this trade higher is a low probability"
"927810","940010"," trade it's like 15 to 30 percent chance I think that the likelihood is"
"940010","952350"," down I think that is the trade I think it's I don't think that the trade is um is"
"952350","962770"," up there this is the the larger time frame this is the larger time frame uh where we should this"
"962770","967690"," is where I was talking about to come down to this right down here J-POW takes a giant shit"
"967690","975390"," we head down to the first we get somewhere up into the 15th here and we start rolling it over"
"976890","983170"," that's where you actually get that roll and that looks this looks reasonable like if you look at"
"983170","992410"," the way this move boom something like that big power push up you can claim that you got your"
"992410","1000410"," holiday rally bears are happy they waited until we hit this major resistance up here this this"
"1000410","1006810"," looks logical like if if there was something to play out this doesn't look unreasonable maybe"
"1006810","1013630"," there's a there's a dip right here catches a but catches a bear off guard and then we have that"
"1013630","1019270"," last final push and end a month trying to look at this from the perspective of when you look back"
"1019270","1023550"," on a chart and you say oh yeah I should have seen all this I should have known we were"
"1023550","1029290"," going to do something like this this makes sense and this this isn't irrational like looking at"
"1029290","1034349"," this here this kind of a move you get your one two and your three and then a power move"
"1034349","1042130"," up and then we start the big sell and you start to see the the uh I always tell like"
"1042130","1052350"," the the the bulguru's explaining that it's tax harvesting so I'm interested in this trade here uh"
"1052350","1062350"," I know that the bears want like sell down and we're we're out because this is their"
"1062350","1068790"," only hope gay pal and this actually gives this other trade here something like this I would say"
"1068790","1075750"," would be anyway something like that right this actually would take some pressure off of um the VIX"
"1075750","1083590"," if you had this dip down below up and then we actually break through the the volatility would kick"
"1083590","1093170"," in down here just breaking that would would kick the volatility you'd trap the VIX bulls and then"
"1093170","1098170"," you'd rip it higher we probably still get to like just down a 20 up here and then rule it"
"1098170","1104090"," back over matter of fact if we went up here now we'd get we'd get volatility again up here as"
"1104090","1109990"," well you get it down here and you'd get it up here so uh if you're a VIX bull you're"
"1109990","1117990"," probably going to be it's going to be uh like a Han Solo ammonium falcon type a couple weeks for"
"1117990","1125610"," you uh in here let me know in chat what you think of this uh idea here that we get"
"1125610","1134190"," some some vol into the event it seems dovish on the outside jpop comes out and says on friday fuck"
"1134190","1139810"," you know it isn't but the reality is it is dovish uh but his initial statements dumped the market"
"1139810","1148510"," uh now if they were doing rates cuts or pauses uh that would should be an initial bump but then"
"1148510","1153350"," I think that the market's going to realize that's not what I think we actually would burn the"
"1153350","1158190"," market if they pause I think that we do burn the market that's the other option too like we don't"
"1158190","1162070"," this is all unknown information if they say they're pausing or they're going to cut rates it's"
"1162070","1171090"," going to get fucking nasty um quick now I'd be looking for like a spike up actually tomorrow and"
"1171090","1177930"," that tomorrow or friday and that's my one one one concern is that uh he was so he was so"
"1177930","1187790"," hawkish interview trying to downplay the discussion on pausing rates uh into tomorrow"
"1187790","1195050"," so or or into december or the discussion about pausing rates because coming into support down here"
"1195050","1202610"," in r1 let me know in the chat what you think is going to happen I'm interested to see what"
"1202610","1207710"," your thoughts are here so we're sitting on some pretty decent support here if this holds I'm going"
"1207710","1213470"," to expect us to trade higher uh I'm going to pop a little box in and um see if this"
"1213470","1219470"," does hold or not and we'll know if we're going to trade down from here if you're bearish you want"
"1219470","1229670"," to break through that that uh this when we're breaking through this r1 you know"
"1229670","1234350"," you can do this on your own charts at home wherever you are show you here in the live stream"
"1234350","1241950"," I just popped in this little yellow box right here you could probably put this box down to right"
"1241950","1249350"," here somewhere so right where this yellow line is right here you want to see this hold and if this"

"1586070","1595850"," they'll split uh to to stop the market uh from they'll uh to pin them who would"
"1595850","1601870"," say pin the market to pin the market sometimes they'll it's all about weight it's all about that"
"1601870","1608030"," some people will tell you that options can't move markets that's a fucking lie that's like a total"
"1608030","1614330"," fucking lie options are absolutely used sometimes it's dealers doing it too it's not just dealers"
"1614330","1619630"," can do all can use all kinds of different instruments not always uh banks sometimes it is banks"
"1619630","1628090"," though that'll do it uh and sometimes it's dealers I mean I guess dealers dealers some people can"
"1628090","1634190"," make an argument that dealers are a um let's take a look at tesla I didn't do the levels yet"
"1634190","1646280"," tesla it's all good tesla looks good I'm"
"1646280","1652480"," not I'm not bearish on tesla here maybe if we break below here it would be if we break below"
"1653020","1660660"," uh if we break below this this is cashmark this cashmark attack tag is good this is bearish down"
"1660660","1668940"," the road but I'm not bearish I wanted to see a break of this yesterday we didn't get it this"
"1668940","1675800"," doesn't I mean some people say this counts as a break but it really doesn't uh you want the break"
"1675800","1683000"," during cash market hours when we have a real real like real market uh so we just had it just"
"1683000","1689520"," now but I'm bullish in the short term now that we've touched it on tesla and then we'll see a"
"1689520","1696760"," roll later on uh but this does uh pretty much ensure down the road that you will at some point"
"1696760","1706340"," see at a minimum you'll see that 134 uh the but the midway point is about $90 and then it"
"1706340","1713980"," could bring the lows of the 70s high 70s even 30s or 40s but the chances of that happening get"
"1713980","1722400"," lower as we head lower on tesla but this pretty much ensures when you see this tag down below in"
"1722400","1729920"," cash market hours these are our algorithmic computers that are that make that broke here and this"
"1729920","1738380"," is not good this is not bode well this is the same as breaking 10 000 on Nasdaq you don't"
"1738380","1747200"," want to see that break of 10 000 shows weak support now but if you did buy uh call spreads"
"1747200","1753620"," I wouldn't sell here this is I I'm looking at this is more of a uh how 3000 or how"
"1753620","1763420"," how 20 22 uh trying to make it legitimate that we got that break and I am long"
"1763420","1769000"," here my calls are now up uh they were down I bought them at 34 cents they're now 39 cents"
"1771240","1780940"," on the spy 30 following along I bought that dip now my price target above is"
"1780940","1790500"," 3900 or 3398 let's see it on a uh another time frame here it's for five people"
"1790500","1799840"," i'd like to see uh i'd like to see at least i'd like to see a failed attempt"
"1799840","1809460"," i'd like to see this today something like that failed attempt to break previous high back here so"
"1809460","1816060"," this one right here i'm looking at and this one so maybe not that high maybe i'll close them out"
"1816060","1822360"," if we can get up here we'll close them out here 397 something like that that's what i'd like to"
"1822360","1839050"," see it starts three verse i'll cut them loose and i'll"
"1839050","1863380"," show you the book map right now assuming i'm sure you book map if"
"1863380","1867000"," you are trading along with me or if you're just joining me for the first time uh if you're going"
"1867000","1871240"," to buy or follow with me there's a couple things that i want to lay out for you first thing"
"1871240","1878000"," you can do is go to your youtube channel and you'll see and the bottom right hand side a you'll"
"1878000","1884900"," see a gear icon and in that gear icon you want to click on it at the bottom there'll be"
"1884900","1893360"," at the bottom of the sub menu you'll see uh an option to speed up the playback speed it up"
"1893360","1899040"," times two and it'll make it quite it'll make it live let me know out there if you guys are"
"1899040","1906080"," getting this in 1080p today i tried to work on the um and under the hood of the streaming software"
"1906080","1911160"," and tried to try to at least get us a 1080p today so let me know in the chat if"
"1911160","1916420"," we're at 1080p if you have that option but you should be able to speed up the live stream so"
"1916420","1922240"," that the delay is only about five seconds three seconds now youtube doesn't automatically delay of"
"1922240","1927180"," 15 seconds so you kind of have so every time you hear me say i'm taking the trade uh you"
"1927180","1935160"," want to speed it up so you can follow along second thing uh if we are if we are trading"
"1935160","1942000"," zero dates which i am today until until we until we either break that that upward channel or we hit"
"1942000","1948280"," the top of the lower trend for the past year at this point in the market i'm probably going to"
"1948280","1956400"," trade zero dates so another thing if you ever hear me uh purchase uh buy a zero date or something"
"1956400","1961920"," like that i want you to be aware that i'm buying for it with a directional bias so i'm going"
"1961920","1967900"," to switch over real quick because i know some of you guys are new here uh so i'm going to"
"1967900","1974880"," show you what i will do this is a new little line right here uh so i bought some uh"
"1974880","1981520"," some calls here and you should put stops on your calls if you if you trade in zero dates i"
"1981520","1987540"," want you to just two two hundred fast rules uh set a stop loss in case you direct the wrong"
"1987540","1995140"," direction and then set a price target that you want to take your your winnings off of you should be"
"1995140","2000820"," like you should be saying hey we're going this way right and then pick where you want to get take"
"2000820","2007740"," profit and you should also as we move higher if we move higher so if we let's say we did"
"2007740","2014880"," pick the right direction uh you want to be moving your stop losses up like this is my stop loss"
"2014880","2023100"," right here here's my stop loss let's say we move up here you want to raise your stops up with"
"2023100","2027900"," your with your calls let's say to hear and move them up then move them up you don't want to"
"2027900","2035920"," ever be giving money back to what i'm about to change mine now right now myself in a moment here"
"2035920","2041680"," but you don't want to be giving money back to the house if you lose sometimes they get caught up"
"2041680","2046100"," in this channel and i'll fucking lose money because i'm not paying attention and i won't set a stop"
"2046100","2052500"," and then i lose my money you should if if you're directionally wrong like you enter the trade and"
"2052500","2057659"," you buy something for fifty cents they shouldn't be going down to like twenty and thirty cents and"
"2057659","2063360"," or twenty cents and ten cents anything like that and stay in that trade if you're buying it let's"
"2063360","2068600"," say you're buying a zero date of like forty fifty cents let's say you buy fifty cents it should"
"2068600","2074639"," start moving in the direction you're anticipating it to move if it's not um you've made a bad trade"
"2074639","2082440"," and so get out of it and reposition yourself before you lose your entire trade okay and if you"
"2082440","2088900"," discipline yourself like that you will lose less you will win more and you will force yourself into"
"2088900","2095540"," knowing when to buy when to sell and you know that discipline should help you be as successful or"
"2095540","2101900"," more at least a more successful trader when you're trading um intraday trades okay so stops make"
"2101900","2108540"," sure you have stops in place make sure you are uh closing instead of you know burnt you know even"
"2108540","2114280"," if you even if you if you don't want to buy in the wrong word the wrong place you know"
"2114280","2119720"," so just be aware of that and then um you'll be the last thing I wanted to tell you guys"
"2119720","2125340"," i think that's it i think that's all i got for you i might get some put fuel here you"
"2125340","2132540"," got forty four thousand uh puts on three ninety five p i'm hoping that get lends some some uh fuel"
"2132540","2140040"," to a move higher but that will uh that those puts will print the call side the dealers will help"
"2140040","2149980"," us here i think we'll find out still have some traffic here the other thing oh yeah we'll"
"2149980","2157460"," just on that last point here the other reason why you are to only holding these directionally is"
"2157460","2166240"," because as the day moves on if you're trading zero ones twos even weeklies these days uh they're"
"2166240","2172980"," really only good to where they're only really good for the move uh so let's say a uh a zero"
"2172980","2180140"," day cost a dollar was a couple issues here let's say that uh on the open right there's a re "
"2180140","2185780","-pricing that takes place in the first 15 to 20 minutes usually it's like horse trading right they"
"2185780","2192800"," they um you've got call holders in here trying to get rid of their stuff and then you've got"
"2192800","2197940"," dealers that want to reprice everything uh so you might have like a um let's say you have uh an"
"2197940","2207900"," option that's uh on this low is a dollar then about 15 minutes later we'll be right"
"2207900","2216630"," back here and it'll be like 75 cents this is re-pricing for today's action okay"
"2216630","2221710"," so once you get that baseline in whatever option you're interested and you want to watch this"
"2221710","2228570"," option all day long as the day progresses and you're gonna watch this option if we come back here"
"2228570","2234670"," it'll or even back here you'll watch that option just it's intrinsic value we'll start to drop"
"2234670","2241670"," let's say it'll then it'll then come down to 65 cents right um and then it'll come down to 55"
"2241670","2249950"," cents now right around 11.30 in the afternoon until 1.30 in uh and this this depends upon this"
"2249950","2255730"," of course right it'll go higher but this bottom will get lower and lower uh and it'll actually"
"2255730","2261310"," accelerate as we get really close to the end of the day like you'll start to see massive drops in"
"2261310","2267090"," the bottom price of that option you'll also if you're watching these all day long you will see"
"2267090","2273950"," premium kicks or removals of options you'll start to see like you'd be like oh yeah we're going up"
"2273950","2280030"," and out of nowhere you'll see the bottom price start to leak and that'll give you a can give you"
"2280030","2285890"," like a minute or 15 minute forward look into what the dealers are thinking are going to happen here"
"2285890","2291790"," um and then when you look at options change in the day you want to look at the probability of"
"2291790","2296710"," where we're going uh we we don't always trade where we're going but the but the dealers their job"
"2296710","2304630"," is to um is to um price according to whether they think we're going for the day so if you"
"2304630","2310590"," see sometimes like right today it's 401 is at 4 cents so the dealers are saying to me go to"
"2310590","2317670"," 401 but the dealers are saying to that chance buddy we we give you like a like a 0.05"
"2317670","2323170"," 7% chance of us going to 401 today now we sometimes will but uh they're telling you it's not"
"2323170","2328690"," likely and today they're telling you uh there's an okay chance that we could go to 398 not a huge"
"2328690","2334950"," chance um they're also setting sometimes that there's some other things that work itself out and"
"2334950","2340210"," sometimes they're trying to sell you uh a full bag as well now but I'll like so right now it's"
"2340210","2348290"," 398 I've been watching them since the open I'm interested in these options all day long uh if I'm"
"2348290","2354090"," going to watch this option all day long and see where it heads where where they get to buy dips"
"2354090","2362090"," on it as we head throughout the day and um and see see see the fluctuation in price it should"
"2362090","2367530"," be something like this you should see the option go down in value through the day and you should"
"2367530","2374210"," see something like this happen with the option of the day so if you can capture that option as the"
"2374210","2380210"," day progresses on these lows you can ride them up just like this uh it doesn't work as well for"
"2380210","2387130"," puts unless we have large directionally down moves uh puts are only built to uh print 100% one to"
"2387130","2395830"," one whereas uh calls can fluctuate massively and we'll look at print I"
"2398420","2408260"," don't know if that helps puts them to also go back to their mean too they're they're only good for"
"2408260","2416180"," the actual they tend to go right back to what they were priced up for it's 1080p fuck yeah sweet"
"2418540","2423920"," uh I didn't know if I'd have any problems streaming today if I do if at any point the stream"
"2423920","2429220"," drops like that stream gets kicked off or anything like that I'll um I'll try to change the options"

"3808720","3818700"," earlier now you don't see them yeah there's a yeah"
"3818700","3829340"," there's yeah there's the wallows come down you can see it see it like that right there so"
"3829340","3835760"," this is all new they were back here before this morning this is all forming right now they're"
"3835760","3845410"," trying to sell the market they're getting aggressive if uh"
"3848690","3854510"," if you're still long and you just want to get out of your calls i don't i don't i don't"
"3854510","3863710"," see why you wouldn't get out here just take your money and run um i would be very careful i"

"3885020","3892300"," move down uh the bears have moved down bears want their uh so maybe this becomes our training zone"
"3892300","3899240"," for today until we roll over something like this damn that wasn't the short-lived right they"
"3899240","3909160"," fucking came right down little shits if i could hate these"
"3909160","3924260"," fucking hate these fucking markets they're"
"3924260","3943860"," trying to keep us down man see that right there some big old supply right there have"
"3943860","3948000"," you looked at a chart of like i don't think i've looked at uh length in a while uh wink"
"3950160","3961780"," i mean it's been like a month or so uh it's"
"3961780","3972600"," a trap uh who's uh what's gaps are you talking about oh you're saying these gaps on length sorry"
"3972600","3978460"," step down look that was just a pull trap uh it suggests one of two things it's suggesting that uh"
"3978460","3990320"," so as here i'll let me visualize it for you so we"
"3990320","3999640"," started out with sellers here right and we started out with sellers here these are weaker sellers"
"3999640","4007580"," so we'll make them yellow and then what happened was so these sellers are actually up here what"
"4007580","4013880"," they did was they came down so they're up here right like hey come on up so you got like"
"4013880","4019400"," a stink bit up here stink bit of sellers right so i'm like a bank and i'm like okay i'm"
"4019400","4026560"," gonna put i'm gonna put like uh i'm gonna sell like i don't know million shares here and i'm gonna"
"4026560","4032520"," have 10 million shares up here so you come up here right and you're like oh yeah we're going we're"
"4032520","4042500"," going up here and so the moment that uh we come up here right here right uh they drop their"
"4042500","4047920"," sell price sorry hold on here they take the 20 million they're gonna sell here and they add them to"
"4047920","4051780"," right here so what you end up doing is you come up and you don't see that and you go"
"4051780","4056860"," we go up there we hit it you look for the next one and now the now the sell order"
"4056860","4065340"," is moved lower so this creates distribution that you didn't know is there and we roll over um and"
"4065340","4072800"," you get fucked now with that being said i'm saying that right now because if you look at book map"
"4074240","4081840"," on the right hand side you'll see that um the 4000 has uh sell orders have disappeared and then if"
"4081840","4087560"," you look closely at $39.90 uh you've got 213 sell orders there now and then they're stacking them"
"4087560","4097260"," just above 3981 has 165 392 has 131 393 has 141 has 176"
"4097260","4105100"," then 128 then you get another block right up here now what else does that mean if they disappear on"
"4105100","4112340"," book map right if those sell orders disappear right you'll see if those sell orders disappear we'll"
"4112340","4118080"," we'll we'll make this go away and then we're we're clear sailing to go higher now so make sense so"
"4118080","4124920"," that'll disappear turn back into a bull trap or a big squeeze or if we get enough volume of buyers"
"4124920","4130660"," to wear down these sellers then we'll have a free ride up top so we're looking for that on book"

"4384780","4385720"," It triggered anyways. "
"4386820","4388500"," I got that 65 cents."
"4388620","4389500"," I should have moved it to 70."
"4391600","4393200"," I should have moved it up. "

"4416820","4421040"," Okay, so we got a tag on, pretty much got a tag on R2. "
"4421840","4422700"," Close enough, right?"
"4425420","4427700"," I think we hit, we missed it by two pennies."
"4429180","4430600"," We'll see if we come back up here."

"4440440","4444400"," I'll bring it back to a hook map so you can see."
"4451330","4453670"," They just smashed the fuck out of those sellers."
"4454850","4456210"," Sellers just got hammered. "
"4458090","4461650"," There was a ton of puts that came into the market when we were riding up there."
"4462750","4466750"," So that means the dealers are buying the market to offset those puts being bought."
"4467930","4469410"," All those, all those zero nay puts. "
"4475410","4477310"," I forgot that my limit."
"4477590","4478110"," See, I did."
"4496800","4499220"," Jess is like I had to turn my volume down. "
"4505000","4508520"," Yeah, it kind of sucks not getting the book map and view on the same charts."
"4508720","4509500"," Okay, yeah, that's right."
"4509620","4510480"," You can detach it. "

"4519460","4520860"," these days we should do a live stream."
"4521080","4525380"," We should do like, we should do like a private live stream on a Sunday or something, so we can"
"4525380","4531520"," do a, we can build like a market and volume profile together."
"4533620","4536100"," Because I also check this every day too. "
"4542010","4543090"," Oh, look at that."
"4543930","4544830"," Is that bullish?"
"4546050","4547690"," Let me know if you think that's bullish."
"4548790","4549690"," Is that bullish too?"
"4553220","4555800"," Just trying to climb over that mountain right now. "
"4558840","4561500"," Trying to, trying to climb over that mountain."
"4562980","4564960"," Look at that mountain we're climbing over today."
"4568150","4571230"," The valuary of low is 3815, 3815. "
"4571870","4574190"," We're about to leg up over that mountain right now."
"4582310","4584130"," That mountain's right here."
"4584770","4586390"," We're trying to climb right over it. "
"4590550","4592930"," Way more buyers than sellers right now in the market."
"4597000","4600980"," So like this, that translates to giant wall."
"4604250","4606250"," We're trying to leg up over it right now. "
"4616760","4617260"," Let's go."
"4617420","4617900"," Let's get up there."
"4617980","4619460"," Let's get some fucking, let's get 400. "
"4621260","4622000"," Let's get 400."
"4622320","4622880"," Let's climb over that."
"4622980","4624500"," Let's climb over that P-shaped profile. "
"4629210","4631570"," Yeah, they got a wall of 3990."
"4631690","4634470"," I think it's a, it was earlier, it was earlier, it was higher."
"4634870","4635370"," They came down. "
"4636410","4637570"," The sellers came down this morning."
"4640420","4647280"," Good to see you, Willie."
"4648200","4649460"," For Thanksgiving this year, man. "
"4651900","4652800"," We didn't want to take out."
"4652880","4653980"," I didn't miss that one day at a time."
"4654640","4657060"," Let me go back and see what you guys are saying. "
"4660190","4660990"," It is funny."
"4663990","4664890"," Cap was edging."
"4666530","4668130"," I didn't hope my wife didn't hear that. "
"4673040","4674600"," My brain doesn't have to process it."
"4676700","4677960"," You've got a one day at a time."
"4678040","4680100"," You've got a good market profile for think of swim. "
"4681200","4686380"," Maybe we should have you on on a Sunday or something Sunday morning and we'll all do a market and"
"4686380","4687240"," volume profile together."
"4693360","4701280"," Yeah, so I did a brine of salt, juice, like orange juice that it apples."
"4703080","4711340"," I did a chilies and then I did parsley and peppercorns and thyme. "
"4713060","4714180"," What else they put in there?"
"4714220","4714700"," Some other shit."
"4716320","4718340"," I grind it for 24 hours."
"4719580","4725040"," I just pulled it out and I'm drying the skin now for like a day or two. "
"4725260","4726580"," I want that nice crispy skin on it."
"4727420","4728100"," I deboned it."
"4728320","4729240"," I didn't spatchcock it. "
"4729300","4735820"," I broke it all down into pieces and then I've got this lime chili dryer I'm going to put on"
"4735820","4740840"," it and then I'm going to grill it or offset smoke it."
"4748040","4749140"," Apple juice and maple syrup."
"4749260","4751220"," Yeah, I didn't do apple juice in maple syrup. "
"4751380","4761200"," Maybe I should have was thinking about like a citrusy chili flavor and then a pomegranate juice."
"4761500","4770320"," I broke it down first before the brine."
"4771500","4775380"," I broke it down and then I brined every piece. "
"4777140","4778160"," Now I'm drying the skin."
"4780140","4781740"," Yeah, market profile, volume profile."
"4782220","4785400"," What you guys could do, maybe you guys should sign up for Think of Swim if you don't have it. "
"4786080","4790120"," Even if you don't trade on the platform, you can use it for a free book map."
"4790240","4793120"," You can use it for market profile, volume profile."
"4795120","4799520"," Even if you just do research there, feel like I'm just going to check this stuff every day, put it"
"4799520","4799960"," in your routine. "
"4802260","4803300"," Adam, you take it easy brother."
"4805640","4806340"," Good to see you."
"4808340","4809220"," Getting some consolidation. "
"4810840","4812080"," Some rule over right now."
"4815400","4816880"," See if you can hold this area of support."
"4819120","4820240"," I'll show you guys a book map. "
"4820420","4821480"," It's kind of weak right now."
"4822280","4824500"," I'm going to expand book map a little bit, see what's below us."
"4827980","4829140"," There is much below us. "
"4829240","4830720"," We want to see this hold right here."
"4851910","4854410"," I'm going to show you guys what the chart looks like."
"4860070","4861530"," What's the half-back trade on this?"
"4866120","4866860"," VWAPs right here. "
"4872400","4874680"," So we'll check to see if we're just going back to VWAP."
"4874960","4882940"," 50 cents for $3.98 or $0.50 right now, $0.51. I'm on the fence on this one."
"4894330","4895650"," This looks like that middle of the day. "
"4895770","4896490"," Bullshit doesn't it?"
"4900010","4901250"," A lot of sellers coming in."
"4902870","4905190"," A lot of sellers."
"4908710","4909930"," This could be a trade right here. "
"4910090","4910750"," I'm not taking it up."
"4911470","4914170"," I keep questioning if I should."
"4914790","4916070"," I want to take the trade right here, but it's risky. "
"4918770","4920810"," I'll bring a book map so you guys can see it."
"4923210","4924050"," Not a bad trade."
"4925710","4926790"," Sellers a week right here. "
"4928650","4930170"," Sellers a week to $3.90 here."
"4933250","4937170"," We have more buyers than sellers right now, so there might be a trade here."
"4942030","4944690"," Yeah, I haven't looked at CLT and H2ID yet and JNK. "
"4945990","4947770"," Yeah, the profile's P-shape right now."
"4951260","4952300"," Yeah, YM looks good."
"4953760","4954540"," Good to see you. "
"4954620","4955020"," How you been?"
"4958500","4959120"," All right."
"4961160","4977920"," I made 50 cents on $3.98. I'm going to put a stop on it of $0.45. We'll"
"4977920","4979620"," see if we get another push here."
"4979900","4981200"," I'll show you what I'm trying to do here. "
"4981520","4988940"," I'm going to look for we didn't quite touch VU up."
"4988940","4990220"," I was probably a little early."
"4991260","4999020"," I could have waited for this right here. "
"4999860","5001000"," Probably the better trade."
"5001440","5002900"," I'm probably a little premature."
"5007880","5011860"," I have to add to it, but I probably should have waited for this and then this. "
"5014060","5015660"," Something coming across there."
"5020440","5023360"," I'm going to have to keep an eye on a bad entry."
"5026300","5026900"," We'll see. "
"5030540","5040370"," If you're not in the trade and you're looking to enter the trade right here is where I"
"5040370","5041550"," would attempt to enter it."
"5042390","5043270"," I made a mistake."
"5046610","5049430"," If you missed the trade, you missed the trade, but that's a good trade right here. "
"5053050","5059830"," I'm literally still lots of sellers above."
"5060610","5063550"," This does look like distribution overall."
"5067070","5068510"," $3.990, man. "
"5068670","5069050"," That's a magnet."
"5070790","5071870"," We got there too."
"5072050","5074290"," If you look, there's a phantom print in here. "
"5074470","5075030"," See this right here?"
"5076330","5077850"," There's a phantom print up in here."
"5079290","5081590"," We did touch there on that previous eye."
"5084430","5089970"," I'm going to be looking to stay in this trade so you guys can see what I want to stay"
"5089970","5094210"," in this trade for is one more touch right here. "
"5095610","5097190"," That's what I'm looking for."
"5099850","5102810"," Unlike myself before, have your finger on the cell button."
"5102970","5103790"," I'm going to switch to cell. "
"5108790","5112830"," I'm going to look to sell up above there again."
"5114110","5118950"," You can even just set a price at like 64 cents, something like that."
"5125170","5126910"," Getting some support coming in right here. "
"5128110","5129890"," You can see it sitting on some support now."
"5132770","5133890"," I'm going to push it up higher."
"5135430","5137070"," I'm going to get like 60-70 cents. "
"5137270","5138190"," I'm like that maybe a dollar."
"5141270","5142190"," Come on."
"5144410","5145370"," Come on, baby. "
"5147370","5148230"," Come on, baby."
"5151670","5152790"," Come on, baby."
"5152810","5152810"," Come on, baby. "
"5154130","5154670"," Come on up."
"5159540","5160680"," You might fail here."
"5162940","5164900"," I'm going to fucking think about a cell. "
"5174280","5175220"," So fucking risky."
"5176520","5179620"," Let me clear this so you guys can just see it on the chart."
"5182080","5183160"," Come on, get up there. "
"5189040","5192040"," Let me watch this go straight down back to this fucking..."
"5192040","5193060"," Yeah, there we go."
"5193060","5194060"," There we go."
"5195320","5196360"," There we go. "
"5196940","5197760"," Keep on going."
"5198600","5199960"," Keep on going to daddy."
"5200360","5201020"," Keep on doing it. "
"5201500","5202180"," Keep on doing it."
"5203220","5206080"," Get up there, baby."
"5206340","5206600"," Let's go. "
"5208680","5209340"," Come on."
"5213120","5214440"," Get on the lawn up there."
"5220780","5222440"," I'm going to at least raise my stops here. "
"5233460","5235160"," I'm at 55 cents on stops."
"5241350","5242930"," I'm about to get kicked out here."
"5244130","5245130"," Not quite, but almost. "
"5250190","5251650"," Don't fucking kick me out."
"5252370","5253110"," Yep, I'm out."
"5258110","5259050"," God damn. "
"5266060","5271680"," I ain't getting fucking kicked out if we keep going up."
"5272520","5273500"," The ship pisses me off."
"5284200","5284820"," I'm angry. "
"5292080","5293700"," No, I'm angry because it looks like we're going out."
"5301890","5302990"," I'm going to say we're going to push up."
"5316670","5319810"," No, no, I'm still making 40, 50% of these trades. "
"5320230","5320910"," I'm still doing good."
"5322530","5324390"," I'm doing a really good day right now."
"5327530","5328870"," I'm having a really good day. "
"5329810","5334590"," I've seen these trades go against me, so it's always the one that I don't put a stop on."
"5334790","5338890"," Fucking thing turns around and I always lose fucking 50 cents or a fucking dollar."
"5341130","5342290"," Look at that squeeze. "
"5342870","5343650"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"5346010","5348390"," Then they're not the 67 cents."
"5348910","5349310"," Fuck. "
"5350370","5351750"," I'm going to 100% trade."
"5354850","5359770"," It wasn't at 34 cents."
"5364500","5365060"," Fuck. "
"5366140","5368000"," God damn 100% trade right there."
"5368820","5370460"," This right here is 100% trade."
"5375330","5376930"," That's 100% trade right there. "
"5381640","5383480"," We'll give Winky eye on it."
"5385040","5385840"," This one's for Winky."
"5395730","5403070"," Look at that move. "
"5405130","5406970"," They're fucking still holding it back."
"5407510","5410050"," Like there's the 398 to like 68 cents."
"5410290","5411270"," They don't want to give up the dollar. "
"5412030","5412850"," They're such assholes."
"5417450","5418970"," Look out above here."
"5419110","5419470"," I'm going to leave. "
"5419710","5421310"," We could move up slightly higher."
"5424510","5428710"," I'll leave a book map on here so you can see where the where the sellers are going to be."
"5430470","5431150"," We're free. "
"5431330","5432110"," We're free right now."
"5432110","5432990"," We've got nobody there."
"5437730","5438510"," Oh, look at that. "
"5438570","5439010"," We got more."
"5439150","5440230"," We might keep going here."
"5441130","5443070"," See that yellow bar way up top there?"
"5443770","5445810"," Looks like we've got some room to move from here. "
"5448710","5450270"," So we're going to keep going."
"5452670","5455130"," So 398 is now reopened again."
"5455830","5456290"," Here we go. "
"5457610","5459390"," Now 81 cents on those calls."
"5460350","5463510"," They were at low at 32 cents, 34 cents somewhere in there."
"5466470","5467390"," Fuckin' a man. "
"5467550","5468070"," This is a good day."
"5468890","5469870"," It's a great fucking day."
"5472010","5476650"," And they just keep buying puts, buying puts, just racking up puts on the other side of the trade. "
"5477570","5479790"," Now trading 39769, breaking through."
"5480290","5484170"," Just starting to move into some resistance here."
"5484410","5485890"," Takes them off the top right around here. "
"5486570","5488610"," Right around here."
"5488930","5489770"," Takes them off the top."
"5490510","5491170"," Takes some money. "
"5494320","5495620"," Start taking some money off."
"5497220","5498900"," This is that previous high."
"5499600","5500520"," We're coming into right here. "
"5501220","5501660"," 39779."
"5502580","5503460"," It's 39781."
"5504120","5505280"," This is where that previous high was. "
"5506600","5508260"," I'm going to see where it is right here."
"5509320","5510120"," See this right here?"
"5511520","5512500"," Almost to the pin."
"5515560","5516460"," Takes some money. "
"5517620","5521720"," Let consolidation happen on R2 so we can make a run for R3."
"5527160","5528140"," We're going to start."
"5528660","5529660"," We're going to bring this back here. "
"5529840","5530880"," Look at that fucking move."
"5535660","5537160"," Look at that fucking move."
"5538360","5539880"," Goddamn gorgeous move, isn't it?"
"5541340","5543620"," Okay, so same game plan as before, right?"
"5544380","5547180"," We just pinged this previous opening high. "
"5547900","5553200"," We're going to look for some consolidation and for the next move up higher here."
"5553620","5556540"," Hopefully we can get this done by 11.30 in the morning."
"5556540","5557740"," We can wrap this day up, dude. "
"5557840","5560120"," We'll get the fuck on out of here early today."
"5560700","5562540"," Do not fuck around with now."
"5562660","5567900"," At the open this morning, what I told you was I'm expecting a roll over here, right?"
"5568180","5570160"," So keep that in mind, right?"
"5570960","5574120"," But we'll see if we can consolidate here because there are more. "
"5574760","5576680"," There's another level opening up above."
"5576880","5577480"," You can see it."
"5578300","5585940"," This is brand new since about 10.40. That target above is that 3.98. That's where we have this"
"5585940","5587800"," R3 level above. "
"5587980","5589320"," We should have some kind of failure up here."
"5589440","5592340"," If we do break through, that would mean that we would consolidate."
"5593720","5599200"," Move up and fail to hit it or we blast through and consolidate and then roll it over tomorrow. "
"5601060","5605660"," My thought is that we swoop out of here and down on the open."
"5606080","5608140"," So just keep that in mind."
"5608760","5609460"," That's my take. "
"5611040","5612540"," So how do I just prove myself?"
"5612860","5615300"," I want to see consolidation in here, right?"
"5615600","5617540"," And then I want to start to see that next leg up here."
"5619520","5621180"," I'll take this next trade again."
"5621860","5623320"," So it'll be nice three pumps for the day. "
"5624320","5625500"," It's definitely a bullish day."
"5626000","5627580"," See if we can get that third pump going."
"5628360","5631120"," We got right down here, right?"
"5631280","5632280"," This was the buy, right?"
"5632460","5634480"," I told you right on this morning, we started the stream. "
"5634660","5636640"," I said, I'm buying calls here."
"5636640","5637520"," I think it was right here."
"5638900","5639340"," Right?"
"5639800","5640600"," Nice leg up. "
"5641460","5642200"," Another leg up."
"5642920","5643800"," Consolidate, consolidate."
"5644400","5644860"," Another leg up. "
"5645720","5646160"," Right?"
"5646380","5649580"," Now we're looking for some consolidation and one last attempt."
"5650200","5655600"," We'll see if we can get that attempt or if we just fail and roll over for later on in"
"5655600","5655980"," the daytime."
"5657000","5657700"," It was a good day. "
"5657800","5658060"," I'm happy."
"5658340","5659540"," I should be very happy right now."
"5659580","5660640"," I've got some great trades today. "
"5663320","5664760"," Yeah, you guys making some money, right?"
"5668430","5669810"," We'll just say and look out above for sure."
"5669930","5670970"," And Q has passed on high."
"5673970","5676230"," Three net eight comes a support bull baby. "
"5676490","5677830"," We're bullish right now."
"5678570","5682330"," And you can see right now, we're already consolidating and waiting to make that move right now."
"5688490","5690190"," So we'll set up the next one. "
"5690350","5690790"," You guys ready?"
"5691070","5693870"," You guys, we're doing this at home with yourself, right?"
"5694050","5696570"," You come over here, you make yourself another consolidation line."
"5697410","5699330"," And we're on trend days like this."
"5699830","5705710"," Every time we consolidate, you look for a consolidation pattern for you to make your next century,"
"5705910","5706010"," right?"
"5706450","5708730"," The best way to trade these is always each pump. "
"5708970","5712890"," You trade that pump, you trade that pump, and then you're looking to trade this pump."
"5725000","5727760"," Fire right Ross fire, baby fire."
"5729360","5733380"," And so you see, I want you to see this, you'll see this yellow and red area over here. "
"5733880","5735260"," This is what you're looking for."
"5736860","5738820"," Just a warning right now, there are more."
"5738980","5740400"," We're right back into it again, right?"
"5740520","5741920"," We got sellers coming down again. "
"5742580","5748160"," You can see on the right hand side of book map, we've got two nine two seventy nine two oh"
"5748160","5748500"," six."
"5751100","5753260"," Two two eighty nine right here."
"5753440","5760670"," I want you to see, I want you to see, let me see, am I doing this wrong here?"
"5761430","5766990"," I want you to see right here. "
"5767930","5772970"," I want you to look on the right hand side on the order flow of the dome over there, the"
"5772970","5777010"," dome, the D to the double or the single OM."
"5778270","5781150"," And you want to see that the sellers are coming down there, okay?"
"5782410","5786030"," And how do I get back to a pointer?"
"5794070","5797450"," That's a pretty decent block of sellers, so you'll probably get some more consolidation."
"5800630","5808730"," Price target above three nine nine eight minus a dollar 30 on that three nine nine eight minus a"
"5808730","5819800"," dollar 30 is what create three"
"5819800","5828580"," eight six three eight six so three eight three nine eight six. "
"5829260","5832460"," That's right here, right eight six."
"5834380","5836140"," Price target right there."
"5849640","5850860"," Price target right here. "
"5854560","5856760"," I will show it to you on the regular stream."
"5859020","5861960"," This is the previous high over here, this dotted line."
"5862680","5867100"," We first tagged it so we want to move up and hit this area right about here. "
"5871190","5873490"," There's our consolidation line right there."
"5876670","5878050"," Just tagged it twice."
"5886750","5888110"," Be warned right here. "
"5889430","5890550"," The sellers have stepped in."
"5891870","5893250"," There's no bottom right here."
"5893430","5894290"," Quick swift reversal. "
"5898890","5902350"," The buy orders have been rug pulled just heads up."
"5903190","5905490"," See that rug pull real quick on on buy orders."
"5906050","5907970"," Come back to the live stream so you can see. "
"5909550","5910910"," I'm in no trade right now."
"5917620","5918480"," There's a book map."
"5922040","5923300"," Hey, you guys making money, right?"
"5923620","5924500"," You guys, there's no reason. "
"5924800","5926260"," Jody, can you see the chart, Jody?"
"5934720","5936340"," I'll just also be aware of VWAP."
"5936480","5938700"," We're trading above, been trading above VWAP all morning."
"5939900","5943540"," VWAP's right down here, 396, 60, 59. "
"5944520","5945360"," Somewhere down in here."
"5945560","5947660"," If they keep rug pulling us, we could head all the way down here."
"5947700","5948140"," No problem. "
"5949000","5951020"," There'll be nothing to come down here."
"5962000","5964320"," There'll be somewhere in there."
"5970910","5972790"," We'll see how much consolidation we get here. "
"5974090","5974930"," I might buy this."
"5978810","5980290"," Let me take a quick look around."
"5980710","5982190"," Yeah, they're buying tons of puts. "
"5985690","5986130"," Done."
"5988770","5990910"," I'm in, so let's see it."
"5993210","5994470"," Let's fucking see it reverse. "
"6000760","6003300"," 3990, if we break through there, we should green bar it straight up."
"6005420","6006200"," We should squeeze."
"6012180","6013480"," 3990, 3992. "
"6014140","6016180"," If we can break through right here, we're going to squeeze up."
"6019260","6021600"," I'll switch back to book map real quick so you can see it."
"6026600","6027320"," Come on, baby. "
"6028500","6029200"," One more time."
"6029340","6030240"," We had two taps up there."
"6030460","6031000"," What are we going to do?"
"6031080","6031880"," What are we fucking here for?"
"6032740","6033760"," If we're up here, let's go. "
"6034940","6040280"," If you're a bear, you want to be selling for, you know, where that price target is, you want to"
"6040280","6042280"," be selling that probably or 400 or so."
"6047940","6048720"," You can see."
"6056400","6057280"," Come on now. "
"6058540","6059580"," Come on now, baby."
"6059820","6060180"," Get up there."
"6060960","6062080"," One last trade for the day. "
"6063100","6063940"," Let's wrap it up."
"6064060","6065700"," Let's make one last trade for the fucking day."
"6065860","6066460"," Let's get up there. "
"6067660","6069080"," Let's fucking call it a day."
"6069520","6071520"," Let's go fuck our girlfriends and our boyfriends."
"6074090","6075150"," Play with the kids. "
"6076610","6077890"," Take the dog out for a run."
"6080370","6083650"," Grab some last minute booze, weed, whatever it is you grab them."
"6083730","6084230"," Thanks, Kevin. "
"6086230","6086770"," Come on."
"6088150","6089910"," One little thanksgiving gift."
"6092480","6094060"," I don't have any stops on my shit. "
"6095200","6096340"," I need to put some stops on my shit."
"6105830","6106390"," Come on."
"6110990","6111750"," Look at that. "
"6112030","6112310"," Look at that."
"6112470","6113270"," Look at that book map."
"6114390","6116810"," Just trying to grind through these sellers. "
"6131620","6133700"," William or buyers and sellers here still."
"6146660","6151120"," All these bears keep buying puts and these fucking dealers just keep fucking offset in that trade."
"6159290","6160330"," I was kicked out of my trade. "
"6164700","6166380"," I didn't make anything out of that trade."
"6173480","6174880"," Let's see if I can reenter it again."
"6185890","6189490"," Let me switch over so you can see what it looks like on the chart. "
"6207900","6208480"," Consolidation."
"6209840","6211200"," That's where it's at."
"6211760","6212280"," Oh, baby. "
"6213800","6216080"," Consolidation stability is the feds."
"6216300","6216980"," Number one focus."
"6216980","6219240"," Again, a feds master making a speech now. "
"6219560","6221380"," Master's making a speech right now."
"6221660","6224040"," Mark Zuckerberg is set to resign next year."
"6224740","6225540"," Holy shit. "
"6231000","6233280"," So you've got some weakness coming and we've got master speaking."
"6236100","6238860"," Mark Zuckerberg's going to go back to the lizard people."
"6242020","6242860"," Yeah, I'm not off. "
"6242960","6243720"," I'm not on right now."
"6251640","6252660"," That's a good question."
"6252760","6254000"," Maliel is asking me right now. "
"6254260","6255640"," Why am I not buying puts up?"
"6255760","6256700"," There's no support right here."
"6257920","6260200"," The bids are being removed and pushed in."
"6260200","6263580"," They're adding that labor demand is still outpacing the supply of workers. "
"6265380","6266120"," It's a good question."
"6266300","6267300"," I'm going to answer that for you in just a minute."
"6268060","6269240"," You have lizard people. "
"6273140","6273760"," Thanks, John."
"6273900","6274500"," I appreciate it, brother."
"6278360","6279000"," Appreciate it, brother. "
"6284340","6285320"," That's Zuckerberg, right?"
"6289520","6291080"," This is like, that's how his tongue goes."
"6291860","6292580"," Tongue, whatever."
"6293480","6294660"," The, like, the eye slits. "
"6295720","6296440"," It's like a real quick."
"6297700","6298280"," Uh-oh."
"6298720","6299620"," Forgetting the porn shit. "
"6299920","6300140"," Hold on."
"6300240","6301240"," I got to kick out the porn makers."
"6303000","6303820"," Hold on here. "
"6305200","6306500"," Getting the 669 stuff."
"6308360","6309540"," I got to kick out the porn."
"6310780","6311480"," Oh, yeah. "
"6311680","6312060"," Right on Winky."
"6312320","6312660"," Thanks, brother."
"6313560","6314640"," Winky was all over it. "
"6318090","6318890"," Yeah, where's Josh?"
"6319730","6321590"," I got to try to find Josh to do what he's up to."
"6321970","6326190"," That's Master says, in most sectors, wage gains are still behind inflation rise."
"6326750","6326950"," So, yeah. "
"6327150","6328210"," So, I'm going to get a good question."
"6329090","6329870"," Maliel is asking questions."
"6330630","6331630"," Why wouldn't I buy puts there?"
"6332490","6333210"," I'm going to give you the answer. "
"6335330","6336630"," There's a whole bunch of stuff that leads up to that."
"6336790","6340370"," But first thing, first thing's first, just coming into today, right?"
"6340570","6342670"," Inflation expectations remain anchored."
"6342670","6345270"," Just coming into today, right?"
"6345470","6348890"," We know, let's, um, it's not a five-minute chart. "
"6349770","6353910"," We know that, um, we came in this morning."
"6356670","6358670"," So, this pivot line was higher yesterday."
"6358670","6363050"," Okay, Master, same amount of inflation expectations, uh, of reasonably anchored. "
"6364470","6366990"," And when I woke up, the smaller than the pivot line was down here."
"6367730","6370450"," And so, the new data came up this morning, so the pivot was here."
"6371290","6373250"," We're above pivot, which is positive, right?"
"6374410","6377730"," We traded up higher, right?"
"6378650","6384550"," It came back down to this, um, flag, I guess. "
"6385970","6387170"," We defended it."
"6387710","6388350"," That's positive, right?"
"6388470","6388690"," It's bullish."
"6389850","6391830"," So, I get all these things saying we're going to trend day today. "
"6391930","6393110"," We defended this area here."
"6393930","6401710"," And so, if I'm looking at a trend day and a dip that was defended, I'm going to be looking"
"6401710","6403270"," for at least three pumps."
"6404330","6405910"," I want to see at least three pumps. "
"6406630","6408090"," How many pumps have we seen so far?"
"6410610","6416410"," We've seen one, seen two, and I'm looking for a third one, at least one more."
"6418230","6419790"," I'm also looking at the time of day."
"6421530","6424930"," And then I'm looking for positioning for bears to short the market. "
"6427250","6432130"," I know that we're in a supportive environment right now, being in positive, positive gamma."
"6435350","6446390"," If we were in, if we were, so us being in like just an intraday, if"
"6446390","6448510"," we're an intraday and this is the pivot, right?"
"6448890","6449590"," For the day, right?"
"6450330","6452070"," This is a by the dip environment."
"6452490","6457070"," So, that technically we're saying is, we're saying is the gamma is good. "
"6457330","6460030"," We're above, we're a good get positive gamma right now."
"6460870","6463410"," So, the markets are supportive, cash markets are supportive."
"6464110","6466130"," So, if we have a falling off, you want to buy the dip. "
"6466690","6467890"," You're falling off, you want to buy the dip."
"6468510","6477770"," Now, if we're below this pivot line, and we were in some, in a negative gamma situation, if we were"
"6477770","6481890"," in negative gamma, but maybe a better way to describe this would be in one month chart."
"6483890","6487930"," If we were to start trading into negative, negative gamma, that's down here, right?"
"6489630","6491270"," It becomes sell the, sell the rip. "
"6491910","6498450"," When you're in negative gamma, you sell every rip, sell every rip, you sell every rip."
"6499650","6507470"," When you're above here, not quite there, but whenever you dip, you buy, you dip, you buy, it makes"
"6507470","6508190"," sense for them."
"6508910","6512570"," Dip, you buy, dip, you buy, until you come into some major resistance. "
"6513350","6515250"," So, where's major resistance for today?"
"6515550","6515890"," It's right here."
"6519610","6521770"," Where's the huge call wall at?"
"6521970","6527910"," It was up here at 406, but it's actually come down to 400 today."
"6528950","6532730"," So, unless we get some call expansion, that kind of stuff, we're looking at a wall today. "
"6533490","6539850"," So, what I want to see, like the best thing I'd want to see, but I really want to see,"
"6540630","6546030"," today is a move up to here."
"6546930","6552950"," Now, if I was to see a bunch of 420 and 430 calls coming to the market today, I'd expect"
"6552950","6557930"," a dip, but then I move up higher to probably 410, 406, something like that."
"6558310","6562670"," That dip would be dealer's offsetting those trades coming up, but it would be supportive of us"
"6562670","6563070"," going up. "
"6563730","6572270"," So, right now, what's happening is, as we head up here, bears are buying puts, lots of puts, right?"
"6574250","6581130"," So, until, or as they're buying those puts, the dealers are saying, oh shit, I got to take the"
"6581130","6581850"," opposite side of that trade."
"6581990","6582850"," I'm going to weaken those puts."
"6583390","6585570"," We're going to go up to here, and then we'll make the roll. "
"6586610","6590110"," So, it's going to also force you to add to your put position later on down the road."
"6592310","6594430"," Then, you want to see continuation of put buying, right?"
"6594610","6599890"," As we roll over and you're now upside down, you want to see more bears put by more puts, more"
"6599890","6600830"," bears buy more puts."
"6601850","6604650"," If you don't see more bears buy more puts, right?"
"6605870","6608370"," We won't continue to doubt that I will actually get a bounce. "
"6608590","6612810"," So, bears, bull, step it and start buying calls will actually start to keep going back up here."
"6614250","6615450"," And you'll get fucked in your puts."
"6616530","6618690"," Not you, but banks and that kind of stuff. "
"6619530","6623850"," So, I'm bullish here, the trend is up today."
"6624410","6625830"," So, the only question becomes where to reverse."
"6627610","6630250"," And just because they're rug pulling, it's just a liquidity break. "
"6630830","6634510"," A liquidity break is just to grab some liquidity to get a better position, better positioning."
"6635290","6638690"," That's why I'm drawing these consolidation lines right here."
"6639470","6643130"," And we've had some sellers here, here, here. "
"6643630","6645450"," Sellers are weakening though as we head down."
"6646270","6650830"," So, I'm going to look for one of these positions or one of these taps down below."
"6651010","6652250"," I should have grabbed this down here and it didn't. "
"6652950","6657330"," And we're going to look for a move higher to resistance above."
"6658430","6659770"," And this is a low price target."
"6659970","6663730"," We could easily go to much higher, believe it or not. "
"6664170","6665170"," And I want to see at least three pumps."
"6666110","6668170"," I want to see at least one big rejection up here."
"6669190","6671190"," And so, we're going to see if we can wear down these sellers. "
"6672330","6673250"," We're on book map right now."
"6673330","6675030"," We may not get it, but that's what I'm looking for."
"6683610","6686790"," We'll see if we keep going up or if we break through. "
"6687970","6688930"," That's what I want to see."
"6689750","6699160"," Now, if we reject up here, if we reject right here, if we keep rejecting in here, hell yeah, that's"
"6699160","6699960"," going to roll right over."
"6701320","6702820"," So, we'll look for that right now. "
"6702820","6703820"," We want to see a breakthrough."
"6707240","6708540"," I missed the trade by talking."
"6710820","6714880"," Part of the streaming kind of sucks because I can't get into the trades I want to be in. "
"6715400","6716580"," So, we're pushing up right now."
"6716940","6720840"," We should, you guys want to go on Twitter and put a big rocket chip on there."
"6720940","6722320"," We should squeeze right through here. "
"6724540","6727000"," Post big rocket chips and spy or whatever."
"6730060","6732400"," No real reaction from meta at this point is there."
"6733780","6736040"," Not much, a little bit, but not too much. "
"6737880","6744820"," Spy is up only 0.74%. Let's see if we can get that last push above here."
"6747640","6749320"," Now, this is day trading, right?"
"6749680","6756520"," So, if we're looking at our overall view in the market, our next big trade that we're not going to"
"6756520","6759160"," pay attention to, we're looking to sell this market."
"6759820","6763840"," So, you want to think about, if you're a bear, you want to think about positioning, right?"
"6764120","6765800"," Yesterday at the close, I talked to you about that. "
"6766460","6771060"," We talked yesterday looking at a monthly chart and said, where does a bear, in this morning at the"
"6771060","6772340"," open, I think we talked about that, right?"
"6773260","6775040"," Where's best positioning for a bear?"
"6775620","6779860"," So, on a monthly basis, we can get to a year basis."
"6780220","6780700"," Let's go to the year."
"6781980","6782520"," Where's a bear?"
"6782780","6785900"," I know, I have different charts for depending on what, these are day trading charts. "
"6786080","6786940"," I apologize about this."
"6788060","6789440"," Where's a bear want to sell it though?"
"6791020","6792020"," They want to sell it."
"6792320","6793940"," The best place to sell it is somewhere here. "
"6795040","6805080"," You want to sell 406, 410, like selling it right here is literally, see"
"6805080","6805920"," that pin up here?"
"6806880","6810460"," That's like the beautiful, imagine selling that perfect, fucking amazing."
"6813020","6814640"," So, you can sell it here."
"6814820","6820100"," You can even do, you can even do put spreads here, you know, put a put spread on right here,"
"6820380","6822420"," put enough time on it, and you don't have to be that accurate. "
"6823100","6824020"," I can respect that."
"6824340","6829520"," If you're a bear and you're like, I want to buy some fucking March put spreads right here, I feel"
"6829520","6829760"," that."
"6830100","6834040"," We could even try it like 420 and it would still probably, you'd probably still make your money. "
"6834820","6835980"," You could try it at 430."
"6837420","6844200"," You could just buy an in the money put spread day for March, and I would tell you that there's"
"6844200","6848140"," a fucking 90% chance we're going to be back down there."
"6849160","6852720"," So, I feel like if I buy a three month in the money put spread, yeah, it makes sense to"
"6852720","6852840"," me. "
"6854640","6858560"," Don't listen to social media, close your laptop and just come back in March."
"6859420","6860760"," I'm sure we'll be back down here again."
"6861900","6866360"," Almost, almost like, I've been a lot of money that would be back there. "
"6866540","6868460"," But where's the best place to take that put spread?"
"6869240","6870700"," Probably somewhere in here."
"6876090","6877450"," So, we'll take that."
"6877570","6878290"," We'll take that trade. "
"6878770","6883670"," We took this trade, remember, from that morning when I woke up, twice I woke up and said, buy that"
"6883670","6886310"," fucking dip for this move up."
"6886830","6891770"," So, you'll see me come out publicly and you'll see me say, sell."
"6892690","6893990"," Sell it all, right?"
"6895230","6900770"," And then on a monthly basis, you can't really get full bear bear town until we break this trend. "
"6901910","6903430"," You can get bearish down here."
"6904430","6908390"," But even then, you have to close your bear trade and pick it back up for the next leg."
"6911110","6913990"," So, just on different time frames, I'm bearish. "
"6914810","6916350"," I'm bearish on a further time frame."
"6918950","6920750"," I think we come down here tomorrow."
"6921370","6922570"," I'm not going to be shocked. "
"6923230","6927550"," If we trade 385 tomorrow, I wouldn't even blink if we traded 385 tomorrow."
"6928590","6930050"," It wouldn't phase me in the least."
"6932490","6933430"," None at all. "
"6934790","6936130"," We're at 397."
"6937470","6939870"," So, that's 100 point drop from right where we are right now."
"6940790","6942590"," So, you see puts being bought right now. "
"6942810","6943850"," So, there are people out there."
"6944010","6946450"," There's banks out there right now buying those puts for tomorrow."
"6947750","6949790"," So, if you want to buy them right here, I can't blame you. "
"6950550","6953150"," But what it's going to do is it's going to fuel the move up higher."
"6954770","6955190"," This is my point."
"6959310","6960810"," Clean up that uh, consolidation. "
"6963050","6965510"," I can't blame you for being like, oh, I want to buy them right now."
"6965770","6968330"," When I'm a fucking bull, I buy the wrong dips all the time."
"6969070","6969690"," So, I get it. "
"6970350","6974350"," I get, I get, I get, I get as a bear being like, I want it right fucking now."
"6976150","6977670"," I don't want to miss the roll over cap."
"6978190","6978810"," I understand that. "
"6979510","6981050"," I can respect that 100%."
"6981050","6985600"," That's what I want to buy."
"6985800","6986900"," I want to buy some puts right there. "
"6988760","6989660"," That's where I want to buy puts."
"6999290","6999610"," Poots."
"6999610","7000390"," Will I miss it?"
"7000590","7000750"," Maybe. "
"7003720","7005000"," That's what I, that's what I want."
"7014230","7014990"," Dixie's ruined the party."
"7015170","7018010"," I haven't gone, I haven't, I should make a trip around the market and see what everybody else is"
"7018010","7018190"," doing. "
"7018430","7018930"," I haven't looked at."
"7021870","7022890"," So, we'll look around."
"7023310","7027750"," So, if you're just joining us for the first time, this is something that, this is a tool that you"
"7027750","7029310"," should put into your, your feather cap. "
"7029570","7033590"," Okay, if you have two blocks, then you get the book map and I get the, I get the book"
"7033590","7038590"," map and I get the levels every day and I got the, I don't know, order flow and I get"
"7038590","7042630"," the, I got market profile and you know, this other fucking nonsense or whatever."
"7044870","7048870"," So, I like to take walks around the, the stock market and see what's going on."
"7049250","7053870"," So, you know, you check the normal things, check small caps, check, check, check. "
"7056130","7057410"," Some of the heavy hitters, right?"
"7057570","7058110"," What's Tesla doing?"
"7058230","7058790"," What's Apple doing?"
"7059430","7060290"," What's Facebook doing?"
"7060430","7060990"," All that kind of stuff."
"7061710","7065870"," But for me, for trading the spy, I'm always looking for Dixie, right?"
"7065970","7067230"," So, Dixie's a big one that I'm looking for."
"7069750","7070790"," So, we'll take a look at Dixie. "
"7076330","7077470"," This was yesterday's chart."
"7082440","7084500"," You can see how this chart's working out, right?"
"7087020","7087640"," Amazing, huh?"
"7087920","7089460"," Haven't even messed with this chart since yesterday."
"7091660","7092420"," What do we say?"
"7092800","7095180"," Buy the dip down here, sell the rip up here, right?"
"7095500","7096240"," Bear towns up here. "
"7098760","7101720"," So, Dixie came into some supply."
"7107080","7109020"," Rigge shade down, sorry, not buy the dip down here."
"7109700","7114760"," Now, this is a sell down here and this is actually bullish on equities. "
"7116680","7118080"," So, I'm going to extend this right here."
"7119320","7121140"," I don't want to see this support hold."
"7122400","7125840"," I want to see this, I want to see a continuation down in Dixie. "
"7132140","7133900"," I don't know if I'm going to get that though."
"7137220","7156940"," I think we're going to, I think we're going to make this"
"7156940","7158900"," smaller so you guys can see it right here."
"7167680","7171480"," Looks like this demand, these, there's more demand coming up in here. "
"7173180","7178730"," Just, let me just look at Dixie here for a minute."
"7180270","7183410"," I would like to see it come back down into this 107 or so."
"7184090","7185610"," So, we'll see if the market rolls here or not. "
"7191500","7192780"," Maybe somewhere right there."
"7195040","7196060"," So, I'll check out Dixie."
"7196420","7198940"," I'll check out Hailed Growth. "
"7207160","7208580"," Still on trend going up."
"7208800","7211220"," This is telling you that the market is going to continue to go up."
"7211840","7216620"," So, the Wall Street Journal here is just citing an FTX lawyer saying that the exchange has"
"7216620","7218620"," unreliable books and compromised system. "
"7219140","7221800"," They're telling the court that the company was not particularly well run."
"7222120","7228060"," It was both the largest and largest crypto failure, according to the FTX lawyer here, according to"
"7228060","7228740"," the Wall Street Journal."
"7229140","7232060"," We've got a gap to fill above on HYG. "
"7232580","7234460"," I'm going to mute this so you guys can stay focused."
"7235360","7236740"," We've got a gap to fill in HYG."
"7236900","7238020"," HYG is looking positive. "
"7239080","7241700"," So, that makes me think that Dixie looks weak, to be honest with you."
"7242140","7245300"," Seeing HYG, bond market is going to tell you the truth."
"7245600","7246460"," I want you to know that too. "
"7246620","7251420"," There's sometimes there's divergences and I'm telling you, HYG is telling you that we're fucking"
"7251420","7252700"," bullish the market right now."
"7253660","7257880"," So, no matter what you have to say to me, this is bullish."
"7259560","7260380"," HYG is bullish. "
"7260720","7261840"," I don't care where spy is."
"7262220","7263760"," HYG is telling you that we're going up."
"7266040","7269120"," J&K and probably going up in a big way. "
"7271680","7275700"," So, looking at HYG or J&K, huge giant gap up here."
"7276100","7277640"," We had a liquidity grab over here."
"7278100","7279600"," Tons of shit going on over here. "
"7279820","7282440"," Bond markets telling you to go along the market right now."
"7282520","7283380"," I want you to be aware of that."
"7283520","7286300"," That's what it's telling you to go along the market. "
"7287460","7288660"," So, then I look at the VIX."
"7288960","7290920"," And, of course, everyone's freaking out about the VIX."
"7292300","7294560"," Yesterday, people were in my stream, freaking out about the VIX. "
"7295160","7295560"," Panican."
"7296460","7296820"," Oh my god."
"7297520","7298860"," Cap, we're almost at 20 bucks. "
"7299060","7301440"," We weren't at 20 bucks, were we?"
"7302380","7304400"," I said, we have more room to go down yesterday."
"7304660","7304980"," Remember that?"
"7306760","7307560"," In 1955."
"7307840","7310080"," We're starting to come into that, this level over here. "
"7311740","7316100"," So, maybe we have some consolidation, but we could easily get another leg down to 20 bucks."
"7316360","7320000"," I know that VIX bulls don't want to hear that, but it happened today."
"7320860","7324620"," So, you know, what can't happen, can't happen. "
"7325960","7328440"," You've had a structural break of support on the VIX here."
"7328540","7329740"," This is bullish on the market."
"7330460","7331080"," Just so you know. "
"7331820","7335360"," This break here, this white box break, that's bullish."
"7336320","7337000"," Okay, what'd you say?"
"7338480","7340040"," And this is not bullish here."
"7341400","7345060"," VIX is now not bullish until we get down here into this level. "
"7346920","7353500"," We might get a little bit of roll in here, but now you're looking for buyers here."
"7355360","7357840"," Now you're looking for the real buyers for VIX somewhere in here."
"7359740","7364980"," And there's bigger support down below, of course at 15, but you're looking at something in here. "
"7365440","7366340"," See here, hold on."
"7370420","7372560"," So, VIX could go as low as 2083."
"7375500","7376560"," That's not a fucking what?"
"7376800","7377640"," That's not a dollar, right?"
"7378600","7383320"," So, I don't know, I don't know if we're done with spy yet or not at this point. "
"7386420","7388520"," All signs are pointing up on the spy to me."
"7389780","7390900"," That dip was bought."
"7393420","7399720"," So, if I'm looking around the market going where are we headed, price target remains the same up"
"7399720","7400060"," above. "
"7402600","7403660"," Makes sense to me."
"7404520","7408420"," Makes sense to buy puts above as well, somewhere up in here."
"7413830","7417270"," Yeah, makes sense to me. "
"7418610","7420910"," So, that is a tool for your toolbox, right?"
"7421850","7426370"," When you're coming out every day to play on different time frames, you should be looking at"
"7426370","7428970"," different time frames, of course, depending on what trade you're taking."
"7429210","7437010"," We are looking to go short at some point for two, three months, but we probably have a little bit"
"7437010","7439690"," more push up."
"7441750","7442450"," So, we'll see. "
"7444670","7446230"," A quick map is looking weak."
"7454690","7456230"," We have your salaries coming in right now."
"7459010","7460090"," Time's not on our side. "
"7461490","7467030"," If you wanted some negatives right now, time, I don't like that it's already it's 1123."
"7467690","7472890"," Remember earlier, I told you that right around 1130, I don't like being long at that time in the"
"7472890","7473090"," morning."
"7475350","7482790"," If something's happened, if we rocket shipped up, I kind of want to be wrapped up with longs right"
"7482790","7485410"," around 1130, 1230 somewhere in there. "
"7485610","7490890"," Sometimes extended to 130 and 230, but I fucking don't like it."
"7491390","7498390"," I feel like you make your money in the morning and then you're done for the day and that's it."
"7498610","7503050"," You don't give it all back at the end of the day, you don't give it back for the close"
"7503050","7503550"," of three. "
"7504250","7506610"," If the market, let's say right now we stop the market stalled."
"7507730","7508930"," Let's say we started stalling."
"7509450","7514150"," I'd probably come back at three o'clock in the afternoon and see if we get that last push up. "
"7514870","7517950"," Build that nice full flag all day long, right?"
"7518510","7520670"," Consolidate it down and then boom, get the ripper up higher."
"7523150","7525630"," But right now, we have a few minutes left."
"7525830","7526750"," We'll see if we get that tag. "
"7527270","7529950"," If we do roll it over, we'll come back."
"7530470","7531110"," We'll take a break."
"7531350","7532030"," I'll leave the stream on. "
"7532510","7535710"," We'll come back at like 233 and look to see if we get that move up higher."
"7536570","7538090"," I'm not going to give him money back today."
"7539070","7540390"," I'm not giving him money back today. "
"7540810","7542370"," I gave him money back yesterday at the end of the day."
"7542450","7543510"," I'm not fucking doing that today."
"7544910","7545870"," No fucking way. "
"7546570","7548110"," The market ain't taking shit from me today."
"7554060","7556140"," We had a nice touchdown here in VWAP."
"7556300","7557760"," That was a nice VWAP trade right there. "
"7559480","7561100"," So we'll see what happens here."
"7565230","7566730"," Sellers are getting weak right now."
"7566730","7567290"," Just heads up. "
"7567370","7568490"," I have a nice long trade coming up."
"7569410","7570470"," Sellers are now getting weak."
"7570790","7572250"," The sell orders are disappearing. "
"7575390","7577290"," I'm going to try to buy some."
"7577910","7579530"," 3.98 or 60 cents."
"7580930","7582790"," 3.99s are 28 cents. "
"7583030","7591010"," There's still no big in those 3.99s. So I think we get up there right now."
"7592310","7594170"," I'm not going to go that big this time."
"7594170","7595430"," I'm going to go smaller. "
"7601510","7602850"," I'm long here by the way."
"7605930","7607150"," I'm long the market."
"7621820","7628660"," If you're not long the market and you're a bear, keep your focus on this area up here to sell. "
"7648370","7649750"," Let me know in the chat what you guys think."
"7651230","7652590"," See what you guys are talking about down here."
"7655150","7655610"," Hey, Joe. "
"7655710","7656190"," Good to see you."
"7659330","7660330"," Happy Thanksgiving, Joe."
"7660490","7661530"," I didn't know you were in the stream. "
"7663310","7664750"," How do you come up with a pair of points?"
"7665330","7666490"," Sorry, this is a stupid question."
"7667450","7667790"," It's not."
"7669950","7672190"," So I get a data feed every morning. "
"7672830","7673650"," I get two."
"7673790","7675670"," I do two data feeds."
"7675870","7679610"," I do a CME options data feed that I download every morning. "
"7680350","7686630"," I try to get it done after 9 a.m. and then I get an email sent to me with"
"7686630","7690330"," I like to go past it."
"7690450","7691590"," I can never say it."
"7692650","7696270"," But like fib retracement, pivot points, previous high lows. "
"7697410","7699330"," They're official from the CME."
"7700490","7709110"," So I start to plot all those previous highs, previous lows every morning."
"7709270","7710550"," That's part of my routine every day, right?"
"7710730","7717410"," So every day I come in, I plot the previous highs, previous lows, support resistance levels, any"
"7717410","7726830"," fib levels, I'll do fib retracement on previous like we know that overall we're in a downward"
"7726830","7727130"," trend. "
"7728230","7733990"," So if you were if we're in a downward trend overall for the year, if you have 100% move"
"7733990","7740390"," going down, we should come up 50% go down 100% 50% go down 50%."
"7740390","7750750"," So I'll just run retracement and see actually this run we're coming up 68% or 61 point, whatever"
"7750750","7754530"," it is, percent."
"7755130","7758110"," But I'll run all I'll run all those never coming into one of those key pivot points. "
"7759130","7764650"," I'll add those to support resistance levels things that people use, fib levels."
"7765650","7774150"," And then of course I check in with a way of gang and see what they're talking about because people"
"7774150","7775090"," do trade at those levels."
"7775290","7784430"," Those are key levels that so I'm not a I'm not a practitioner of Elliott wave theory, but I'm aware"
"7784430","7784790"," of it. "
"7784910","7786130"," I'm aware of how it works."
"7786390","7791450"," And I know that people and hedge funds and they trade to those numbers."
"7791510","7794550"," I know that other people are aware of who's what their numbers are. "
"7794910","7800230"," So you ever see reactions at those levels, you know that people trade moving averages on different"
"7800230","7800790"," timeframes."
"7801630","7806390"," So I'll cycle through five minute charts, 15 minute charts, one hour charts, four hour charts,"
"7806750","7814190"," daily charts, and then go back and I'll do traditional charting methods."
"7816470","7818330"," So that's an I hope that answered your question. "
"7818830","7819490"," Can you look at costs?"
"7820570","7821610"," I'm long and it's not really much."
"7821750","7822030"," Thanks."
"7822350","7825530"," What kind of long are you GM on cost?"
"7826090","7827130"," What is long mean?"
"7829550","7830630"," Dixie's ruining the party. "
"7831390","7832210"," Tesla's heading down."
"7832850","7833970"," Hey, Floyd's garage, are you?"
"7836250","7840910"," Would you hold a 12-9 call contract about last week, F.R. ago?"
"7843230","7848150"," If you guys want to go back and watch the original part of this video, I gave my synopsis of"
"7848150","7849070"," when I think it's going to happen."
"7850070","7854530"," It shows when you should make an entry on a call contract into December. "
"7856730","7858970"," Yeah, that VWAP was a perfect touch almost, wasn't it?"
"7859450","7861250"," You ever look at junk to IG bond spreads?"
"7862110","7862290"," No."
"7864170","7865050"," Captain question."
"7865790","7866670"," Do I look at spreads?"
"7867530","7867530"," Yeah. "
"7868310","7871010"," I listened to a couple of bears that do."
"7872290","7874350"," I let them regurgitate it to me."
"7875010","7877650"," Just hold a 12-9 call contract about last week. "
"7878350","7878890"," Hold on."
"7879950","7882110"," Screw the VIX and the motherfucker down in 18."
"7882450","7884650"," Yeah, if you're a bear, you want to see it down there, right?"
"7884950","7886730"," You have the VIX down in 18, it's easy buy. "
"7888450","7889790"," Your bearish try to paint."
"7890530","7893790"," What if situations of VIX can you take a look at Domino stock?"
"7894230","7895790"," Everyone's buying pizza during the World Cup."
"7896970","7897790"," Dom made new highs. "
"7899190","7905470"," That's why we're at Kalash."
"7906610","7909570"," I have the audio quite high right now."
"7910970","7913330"," I'm painting the yellow here. "
"7914090","7917090"," Check 1-2, check 1-2, check."
"7918310","7920210"," Am I blowing anybody out right here?"
"7920810","7921870"," I think I've got my gain up too."
"7923030","7924170"," You guys can hear everything. "
"7928330","7931570"," My levels are just starting to paint the yellow."
"7937390","7941350"," We're either going to roll this over right here, we're going to squeeze up."
"7942290","7943490"," This is kind of where you see it. "
"7944390","7947030"," You guys want to be aware of when this happens."
"7949510","7951910"," I want you to see this."
"7957360","7961380"," It's a nice little liquidity grab down here on VWAP. "
"7966060","7967820"," This might be the last one right here."
"7968240","7969540"," Bam, move higher."
"7971380","7974160"," Before we get this right here, directly right off where we are. "
"7974980","7978460"," But sometimes it can get really scary here and we'll start dumping."
"7979160","7981980"," That's option number three of what happens right here."
"7982300","7982740"," We'll see what happens. "
"7984800","7986140"," It's getting hairy right now."
"7991880","7993080"," The liquidity is getting a little thin."
"7994660","7996700"," I'm going to move my stops up right now. "
"7997700","7998660"," I'm a little scared."
"8001460","8004220"," I've got stops on 50 cents on 398."
"8008800","8009800"," I don't want to get caught. "
"8012780","8015300"," I know some of you guys think it stopped out too early."
"8015580","8016180"," Sometimes on moves."
"8017160","8019820"," I'd rather make 10%. "
"8022920","8025240"," My stops are somewhere in here."
"8028750","8029610"," Somewhere in there."
"8033050","8035010"," I'd rather make 10%. "
"8035010","8038510"," Be wrong on going up."
"8040530","8045830"," I've made 300% on three trades and then lose 100% on seven trades."
"8048070","8048890"," Nope, I'm out. "
"8050190","8051210"," So there was that roll."
"8054300","8055880"," I just got picked off right there."
"8056560","8060420"," And if we start to roll down here, I'm going to look three after again down in here. "
"8061460","8063300"," See if we can grab one more time over here."
"8066420","8067620"," Yeah, I don't want to lose money."
"8067860","8068960"," I'm not giving money back. "
"8069040","8071080"," I'm not in the business to give money back to the fucking banks."
"8071760","8080900"," I'm in the business of not fleecing, but just taking a little bit from old fat white guys, greasy"
"8080900","8081720"," greasy hands."
"8082920","8086740"," I think Eric Hagar calls them empty suits. "
"8088600","8090620"," Like Harvard educated empty suits."
"8090780","8093920"," I want to just skim a little bit of money out of their pockets."
"8094820","8096020"," So you should too. "
"8096600","8105600"," The name of this game is you can from those greasy old empty suits."
"8109060","8110980"," We got some rolling and key right now."
"8115270","8116630"," John's saying it starts to roll. "
"8116770","8118690"," It starts rolling over when you take quick puts."
"8119730","8122830"," I don't because so I do take puts."
"8124250","8126070"," Let's talk about puts real quick. "
"8126950","8128830"," I've been having a hard time finding this article."
"8129730","8130730"," There's a great article."
"8130990","8140890"," Maybe one of you guys can remember the name of the I think a university put it out or maybe"
"8140890","8142090"," the CME put it out. "
"8142470","8144450"," I don't know if it was a CME that wrote it or not."
"8148130","8152730"," There's a long I don't know what it was, but there was a paper that was released like a white"
"8152730","8155130"," paper research paper and it goes into puts."
"8156130","8157650"," You guys should watch the put chains. "
"8157970","8164430"," Like if you're going to buy a zero day to one day puts, they need to be there."
"8164610","8165850"," They only print one to one."
"8166350","8167030"," They're not built. "
"8167290","8168050"," They were never made."
"8169250","8170730"," You used to only be able to buy stock."
"8171030","8173770"," Then you were able to buy calls. "
"8176590","8177930"," They didn't even have puts."
"8178370","8179070"," Did you guys know that?"
"8179470","8183770"," Like you could only buy calls and then they built puts."
"8184330","8188050"," When they made puts for the market, they made them as a hedge. "
"8188770","8189730"," Almost like currency."
"8190290","8194610"," You get currency traders, but currencies aren't built or made to trade."
"8195450","8200250"," They're meant as a vehicle between governments and markets across the world. "
"8203150","8211910"," So puts were never intended for you to be using them anything for anything other than a hedge."
"8212389","8214290"," And so they kind of act kind of wonky."
"8215010","8224530"," I have a lot of respect for put buyers, but they're not built to be that great unless you're"
"8224530","8229950"," directionally correct for a long period of time, a pretty large move, right?"
"8230410","8232549"," Moving between two to three to four levels, right?"
"8233889","8240330"," If you watch puts that they'll, like let's say I buy some puts, I have to hold them all day"
"8240330","8242790"," long to get a hundred 200 percent print on them. "
"8243370","8245290"," And I have to wait to break through two, three levels."
"8245650","8247410"," I have to be directionally very accurate."
"8249430","8253469"," And then even then they'll lose their value at some point in that day. "
"8254250","8256770"," So the risk to reward for me is not good for me."
"8257430","8262450"," I like the risk to reward shorting the market, but puts in general I try to stay away from."
"8263030","8263690"," I like calls. "
"8264490","8267969"," I like buying stock for longs."
"8268030","8271250"," I like selling the market shorting stock for short."
"8272330","8274129"," I love futures contracts. "
"8275309","8280070"," I love buying calls, excuse me, I like buying underlying and selling puts and calls on it."
"8280590","8281549"," I love spreads."
"8282129","8284510"," If I'm bearish in the market, I love put spreads. "
"8285290","8286250"," I think they're fucking awesome."
"8288570","8289530"," I like flies."
"8289930","8292030"," I like condors depending on what the situation is. "
"8292750","8295709"," I'm not a fan anymore of credit spreads."
"8296110","8303350"," I do prefer debit spreads because I feel like I can, it's like something I can place and go back"
"8303350","8306430"," to my bunker and come back and check on them down the road."
"8307570","8314250"," And I also don't like the, I don't like credit spreads because I think they're not things, but they"
"8314250","8320150"," are dangerous if you get exercised on them or the risk of exercise. "
"8321750","8325129"," And then I trade all these instruments depending upon the product."
"8327049","8332170"," Some some some some some spreads I don't trade on certain tickers because of liquidity issues."
"8332370","8333870"," I like to trade most of this stuff on the spy. "
"8334350","8336530"," This is great liquidity and settlement to cash."
"8336870","8340230"," You guys know about this stuff like settling spreads to cash is always preferable."
"8340730","8342230"," And then you have to watch out for dividends. "
"8344670","8346950"," Tickers with dividends trade spreads on tickers with dividends."
"8347850","8351809"," So depending on what you like to use out there, I can't blame you."
"8352530","8355129"," The SPX is great to trade for the tax benefits. "
"8357049","8361330"," So I can't put I can't blame people for what what instruments they use."
"8361870","8368230"," For me, what I've been reduced to this year is mostly call spreads, put spreads at big directional"
"8370129","8375350"," intersections, that tops big tops and big bottoms and day trading."
"8376969","8383030"," I used to up and I've slowly rest the last three years to this point. "
"8383350","8384209"," I used to own stock."
"8384770","8387049"," I used to own stock and sell puts on it."
"8387290","8390070"," I used to they used to run the wheel. "
"8390770","8399010"," But just this year specifically, I feel like I've been reduced to put spreads call spreads at large"
"8399010","8400250"," intersections."
"8400310","8404730"," Those have kept me paid very well and then day trading."
"8405650","8406630"," It's funny too. "
"8407270","8411250"," You can like, you know, let's do a prime example."
"8412110","8412770"," It's crazy."
"8413170","8417270"," Like we could just look back to right here. "
"8417590","8418550"," Look at this right here."
"8420110","8421970"," This is not a normal market."
"8422210","8422730"," You see this. "
"8425310","8426050"," Just not."
"8426410","8427170"," Just not normal."
"8427630","8429990"," So let's say you sold this right. "
"8430650","8434890"," You're like, I bought a month put on the market here cap and we're down here."
"8435370","8436470"," You can't hold it anymore."
"8436550","8437370"," You have to close it out. "
"8437470","8438910"," You're like three days in, you're closing it."
"8439810","8440710"," Does that make sense?"
"8441670","8453710"," It's like you're directional and but you have to close faster than you ever would have in"
"8453710","8454670"," previous markets."
"8455130","8456130"," These moves are violent. "
"8457670","8459790"," That's some wild swing right there."
"8460650","8461450"," That's vicious."
"8462710","8468050"," So this shows you that people are like, they're shorting but then they're they're fucking taking"
"8468050","8468810"," their money and running. "
"8469550","8470890"," You know, you're seeing that."
"8471050","8473470"," You're taking their money and they're running that we're coming back down."
"8475590","8478330"," So you and you're seeing it in the options chains. "
"8478970","8480030"," I don't think it's people."
"8480030","8481090"," I think that's computers."
"8482070","8487990"," I think computers are fucking around with our markets to an extent where it's becoming harder and"
"8487990","8490570"," harder and harder for human to compete. "
"8492310","8493990"," And so I think we're reinforced into that."
"8495530","8501290"," I'm going to be enforced into competing with computers to an extent that you have to be in, out."
"8501710","8505470"," You have to be targeted on price at all costs. "
"8506590","8510990"," You know, like this is where I'm going and I'm getting the fuck out as soon as we get there."
"8513880","8514640"," That's my take."
"8515380","8522300"," There used to be the saddages where a lot of guys will brag and be like, if you know the"
"8522300","8529220"," direction you hold the entire way or you go all in on that move, I agree with that in some"
"8529220","8534580"," instances, but I think the markets change to where robots are much faster and better than you. "
"8534920","8538160"," So I don't think that holds as much weight as it used to back in the day."
"8538840","8539700"," Not back in the day."
"8539780","8540540"," This is just a couple of years. "
"8540900","8545260"," It got real bad the last four to five years, but it's been slowly getting worse and worse."
"8545780","8547060"," It's a nice trade coming up right here."
"8548160","8548740"," I'm in. "
"8551320","8552960"," I'm in that trade long again."
"8554520","8556220"," I've been for 48 cents."
"8560900","8564600"," It's hard right now to it's hard for a trader, for an investor. "
"8567260","8570720"," When I play spreads, I don't even open the brokerage."
"8571180","8572260"," I leave the brokerage closed."
"8573200","8574220"," I get alerts from it. "
"8574600","8576540"," I put limit stalls on my spreads."
"8577500","8581220"," I fucking like the way this market goes right now."
"8581780","8587260"," Like on fucking Monday, everyone's going, we're going to 500 on Tuesday. "
"8587320","8594380"," We're like, I'll see you at 3000, you know, like our fucking market right now."
"8595280","8596580"," It's so fucking crazy."
"8596600","8597860"," I've never seen this much volatility. "
"8598460","8599760"," I don't recall this much volatility."
"8600960","8603300"," Even in even in COVID, we knew we were going down."
"8604160","8605760"," Like everybody was in puts. "
"8606300","8607940"," Every fucking body was in puts."
"8608640","8614320"," I mean, it was so we were making so much money that we're just showing screenshots like I just made"
"8614320","8614640"," 20."
"8614780","8615300"," I made 60. "
"8615600","8616060"," I just made 100."
"8617300","8618500"," It was fucking insane."
"8619200","8620240"," It was just like one way. "
"8620340","8621240"," We're just going one way."
"8623800","8624840"," Everything's changed."
"8625560","8627940"," The rise of volatility has been. "
"8629240","8630080"," Unfucking real."
"8639610","8642690"," Yeah, that's what that's another thing that they've done is up."
"8643170","8644210"," What's going on here?"
"8645130","8646130"," Oh, shit. "
"8647250","8648090"," Again, caught."
"8648270","8649190"," I want not paying attention."
"8650890","8655110"," I'm going to put a stop on this at 40 cents. "
"8655470","8656630"," I want to get caught in a trap here."
"8660830","8661230"," Yeah."
"8661330","8664410"," The other thing that hedge funds and traders learn. "
"8664510","8667690"," So back in the day in Wall Street Bats before the rise of the meme stock."
"8667810","8676650"," Well, we had meme stocks before then, but before the rise of GME, a lot of pro professional people"
"8676650","8677870"," hung out in Wall Street Bats."
"8678050","8681750"," They would help all young guys try to make money, especially ones they're willing to risk at all. "
"8683050","8687810"," To have a shot at life, I guess."
"8689490","8691670"," That's how you camp with like retards and stuff."
"8692630","8697930"," Because we weren't these kids not to do it, but they would let it all ride and they would show"
"8697930","8701850"," their bet and then they would show their winnings and they would get mentored behind the scenes and"
"8701850","8702690"," DMs and stuff. "
"8706610","8716370"," But what happened was after GME got blew up, professional traders studied and hedge funds"
"8716370","8725110"," and large banks began to study what was going on in that retail community and they started to make"
"8725110","8725550"," baskets."
"8726270","8728390"," You can actually see it when the meme stocks pump now."
"8728930","8735190"," Those are all baskets of banks fucking pumping and dumping those stocks now. "
"8735350","8740410"," So it's like part of their portfolios now, which is kind of gross."
"8743590","8751850"," It's been like corporatized or like when you're a kid and you have a language that you use and then"
"8751850","8755570"," one day you see it on TV and you go, oh shit, the cat's on the bag."
"8759430","8761330"," So that kind of sucks. "
"8763430","8766450"," That's I think that's been added into the AI stuff as well."
"8772580","8773620"," You want to take a look at like?"
"8777690","8781610"," I've got a list of Jesus Christ."
"8782790","8783570"," Look at that. "
"8788130","8789710"," Well, that looks like a sell, doesn't it?"
"8801620","8802560"," Talk about a mover."
"8803660","8805080"," I didn't even wait over here."
"8805080","8806440"," Did it just rocketed it out?"
"8810100","8810580"," Jesus. "
"8810580","8813940"," $117 to $213."
"8816320","8816520"," That's insane."
"8822620","8823280"," That's crazy. "
"8843960","8848220"," We've got some divergence going on on which is good to see."
"8848400","8854040"," We've got some divergence going on on the VWAP right now."
"8857120","8858880"," And we look like we're going to trade lower. "
"8860600","8861800"," I'm probably going to lose."
"8861960","8862960"," I'm probably going to right here."
"8863020","8864120"," I'm going to tag out here shortly. "
"8865760","8871600"," Just on book maps so you can see what I want you to see, the mainstream, see this divergence with"
"8871600","8872880"," VWAP coming down."
"8877060","8878040"," Right down here."
"8882340","8884660"," So you might have a quick drop here. "
"8888350","8889170"," This is dragon."
"8889410","8889830"," This is dragon."
"8893570","8899930"," Still in the good here, but we've got some, a lot of red balls coming in here. "
"8899930","8901630"," This heads up might roll the market over."
"8901750","8903330"," I want you to see it on book map."
"8907510","8908550"," Losing some liquidity. "
"8914860","8919760"," If we do roll this, if I get, if I get stopped out here, probably going to be the last"
"8919760","8923380"," trade for the day until like three o'clock."
"8923880","8925420"," So what I'll do is I'll leave the stream up."
"8925520","8926940"," I'll put the news back on. "
"8927760","8936380"," If you guys want, I have a lot, I could put on, they say the price would be as high"
"8936380","8940160"," as 70 bucks a barrel for oil, cap on Russian oil prices."
"8943340","8948300"," Oh, met as Andy Stone is saying speculations about CEO mucks and Mark Zuckerberg's rise of"
"8948300","8948900"," resignation or false."
"8962930","8964770"," Read and master's comments from earlier. "
"8966270","8970610"," Maintaining price stability is a accomplished using all available means."
"8971530","8972950"," Holy fuck and shit."
"8973110","8975410"," These people are fucking, I gotta stop swearing. "
"8979430","8985730"," Expectations for longer term inflation remain reasonably anchored after, after repost that, that"
"8985730","8987210"," post I made this morning."
"9007660","9008800"," What's going on with Tesla?"
"9022100","9025300"," Tesla needs to get over 170 50 or something."
"9026700","9029560"," Tesla not getting over it's like it's 170 50. "
"9031380","9033420"," If Tesla doesn't get up here, right?"
"9034000","9034520"," There's no bueno."
"9037660","9039280"," Tesla needs to get up here."
"9039280","9043460"," I don't like that. "
"9043840","9045000"," I don't like Tesla."
"9049750","9050790"," Didlin down here."
"9056680","9057860"," Pay my money, man. "
"9061170","9063030"," Just pay my last squeeze up here."
"9067690","9069290"," I'm gonna take the rest of the day off and relax."
"9082290","9083970"," Paying my last payment for the day. "
"9083970","9088170"," I just want fat old man greasy money."
"9094160","9095060"," What do we got here?"
"9100210","9101530"," We're stalling out a little bit."
"9104630","9107370"," I'm gonna raise my list stops. "
"9108590","9109550"," 45 cents."
"9114610","9116310"," And I'm hoping that I make one."
"9116390","9117750"," I hope we can get one more move up higher. "
"9118550","9120290"," But we are stalling out a little bit here."
"9120390","9121730"," I don't like seeing this stall."
"9129260","9131860"," Yeah, yeah, Zaka's not resigning. "
"9139020","9143000"," Yeah, Master, I just reposted on Omar."
"9143240","9148300"," I just reposted on Twitter when I posted this morning, which is just repeating what they've been"
"9148300","9148600"," saying."
"9148600","9150220"," It's just like non-stop garbage. "
"9151240","9152760"," Hey Brad, how are you?"
"9153480","9154380"," Happy Thanksgiving, Brad."
"9154700","9156060"," Happy Thanksgiving anybody out there."
"9156540","9160720"," And yeah, the Zuckerberg resignation is false. "
"9162440","9163640"," I want to be, how are you?"
"9165080","9166300"," 400 come to Papa."
"9168020","9168860"," Hello, Wannabe."
"9169020","9169520"," Thanks for joining. "

"9178720","9182720"," can post levels on your own charts so you can follow along."
"9183440","9186560"," We had some other levels depending on what we think is most important. "
"9188660","9189900"," What else we're talking about here?"
"9190500","9191740"," But I appreciate you being here."
"9192440","9194060"," It's a time when a double bottom going on."
"9194220","9195520"," Tesla is frustrating, dip by. "
"9196160","9197440"," Yeah, do I think it's a double bottom?"
"9199060","9205920"," You know, Madison, for two days of sideways, well, in my view, the second half of yesterday and"
"9205920","9209940"," today being a, yeah, J&K is showing we're going up."
"9209940","9212960"," Uh, chess will please go boom boom."
"9214040","9214940"," It's getting slow. "
"9218160","9219060"," It's dragging him."
"9219140","9220260"," I'm getting pissy hair, Winky."
"9226410","9228310"," Yeah, we know the script agreed with that Omar. "
"9230010","9235110"," Hey cap of any idea what price, bears and traders will have max FOMO and shorting Tesla."
"9236490","9237110"," Is it at this range?"
"9237730","9238550"," Uh, yeah, follow me."
"9238550","9245510"," If you just look back on my post that I had yesterday on, um, on Twitter, on regular Twitter, on"
"9245510","9247150"," just by regular cap, Jim James handle. "
"9247490","9251190"," I talk about where the bottom is on Tesla, but it's never straight down."
"9251710","9253090"," Fucking bears out there, man."
"9253350","9255110"," Fucking, I can bulls do this shit too. "
"9255510","9258330"," Bulls will be like, we're going, you know, like moon isn't today."
"9258750","9263090"," So like, if I say moon is 400, they'll say moon today is 420, right?"
"9263330","9264810"," I'm like, that's not fucking happening, bro."
"9264810","9273330"," Uh, the staircase or the elevator down does work for bears, but it still goes up and down as it's"
"9273330","9273810"," going there. "
"9273990","9279010"," So, um, I don't like to see Tesla still fucking around here."
"9280230","9284590"," You really want to see like a green hammer candle and then a move forward."
"9285830","9290330"," You want to see a violent slam down on Tesla and then a move forward. "
"9290730","9296710"," I don't mind them hitting that target, uh, today in cash market that seemed reasonable, right?"
"9296850","9298670"," But I really don't like seeing him hitting it."
"9299230","9301630"," I don't really like fucking like this right here."
"9302090","9304290"," This, this final move down right here. "
"9304690","9306210"," This was what you want to see right here."
"9306450","9307210"," Bam, bam."
"9307850","9311870"," Doesn't matter if you come back down here, but I don't like dicking around over here either. "
"9312270","9313830"," I want to see it roll down here."
"9314450","9319130"," I want to see that hammer candle, which this is the volume candle."
"9319950","9322490"," And then I want to see wam. "
"9322790","9323570"," I want to see it move."
"9324770","9326430"," Um, no, that's not bullish."
"9327510","9334470"," This is your, this is your bearish signal, uh, but you want to see shorts cover and then reshort"
"9334470","9340330"," again on high that read that short the next short summer around, I believe it's two 13, but I could"
"9340330","9340670"," be wrong. "
"9343480","9344460"," I think it's two 13."
"9345240","9346500"," I could be wrong on that."
"9346700","9348580"," It might have changed off the look. "
"9348840","9352860"," I can look at it and post it on Twitter for you what the number is today."
"9353000","9353700"," It changes every day."
"9354360","9355560"," I think we get there or not. "
"9356180","9356600"," Here we go."
"9356720","9356900"," Come on."
"9357400","9358300"," Get up there for me. "
"9358480","9359880"," Just give me the fucking day, man."
"9360000","9362300"," So I can go take the day off and drink some whiskey."
"9362800","9363780"," But thanksgiving, baby. "
"9364600","9366020"," I want to end this trade so bad."
"9367540","9372100"," Yeah, I'm at 45 cents."
"9372520","9372740"," I'll move. "
"9372920","9373580"," You know, I'm going to move it up."
"9373800","9374980"," I'm at 50 cents now."
"9375960","9381440"," Um, first stops on three 98 C's. "
"9381840","9383900"," They're trading for 54 cents."
"9384800","9387060"," Or I say that now they're coming down."
"9387360","9388700"," I don't want to get stopped here either. "
"9390260","9392040"," This book map looks good."
"9393140","9396320"," I hope all these sweatshops just want to fuck it."
"9396420","9397800"," Not sweatshops, but boiler rooms. "
"9398300","9399580"," Don't they want to close out the day?"
"9400480","9401020"," It's goddamn thanksgiving."
"9401960","9402900"," So you should be swearing."
"9405420","9406460"," Let's be done with the day. "
"9406640","9407440"," Let's roll it over."
"9407860","9410620"," Buy some fucking trade it up."
"9411040","9415140"," Buy some put spreads for doom for the doom minutes. "
"9416060","9416560"," Cut that."
"9416740","9417660"," We'll cut the put spreads."
"9418080","9419100"," This is how sick I am. "
"9419100","9420160"," I'm such a gross person."
"9420720","9421900"," I'm going to say exactly what I'm thinking."
"9423280","9424900"," This is how horrible I am as a person. "
"9425100","9425720"," I'm a horrible person."
"9425900","9428500"," I'm like, I'm sick."
"9429140","9431080"," I'm like, let's trade this up. "
"9432660","9433200"," Right."
"9433920","9435240"," Let's buy some put spreads."
"9436180","9438440"," And then we'll, we'll hear bullshit doom. "
"9438840","9443240"," We'll have that one brief moment 2 p.m. where they print, right?"
"9443980","9450940"," You cash those out and then you buy the dip with zero dates and you slam it up into Wednesday"
"9450940","9452420"," clothes, right?"
"9453160","9455020"," Take your money and run, right?"
"9455740","9458100"," And then we have a day off and then we trail down."
"9458340","9460580"," We got, we got big bad J-POW on Friday."
"9461040","9462380"," He's going to shit all over us. "
"9462960","9469180"," Then they come back on Monday or something or the first and we buy long for the till the 15th"
"9469180","9469660"," of December."
"9469900","9470440"," It's pretty gross."
"9471640","9474180"," But oh, here we"
"9475500","9484660"," go. "
"9484660","9485020"," We're already man."
"9487000","9488800"," Still filthy."
"9489160","9489780"," There we go. "
"9490080","9492080"," We're up to 60 cents on those calls right now."
"9492440","9494240"," I moved my stops up 55 cents."
"9498290","9499070"," All right. "
"9499570","9502050"," There we go."
"9507350","9508570"," It's kind of gross, right?"
"9508990","9509410"," Kind of disgusting."
"9512310","9518150"," And then meanwhile, you've got like investors and all they want to do is like buy a position and"
"9518150","9519610"," hold it for seven months or a year. "
"9520250","9523510"," And then you got bears that are like, all they want to do is chase winter."
"9524710","9526290"," I don't know if you guys know chase winter."
"9526510","9527510"," Some of you guys know chase winter. "
"9528230","9533890"," Fucking chase was like, I loaded up on $100,000 and put spreads on January."
"9534190","9534670"," Fucking fourth."
"9535110","9538190"," And then on those wild swings and those swings down and swings up. "
"9539070","9540390"," We're all like chase."
"9541030","9545250"," Did you take profit here and like re-enter on a high?"
"9545530","9546410"," He's like, no, fuck that."
"9546530","9547010"," I'm still in. "
"9547770","9550630"," He's like, or I think it was a short, I don't know if it was a short or put spreads,"
"9551030","9554570"," but he's like, I don't give a fuck about the 300 point swings."
"9554610","9557570"," He's like, I'm just holding it until the fucking market goes down to zero."
"9558650","9562330"," I don't know if he still does that, but it was hilarious. "
"9564050","9565130"," You guys remember Chase?"
"9565610","9566290"," He's fucking awesome."
"9566530","9566890"," I love him."
"9567970","9569470"," We'd be screaming at him in chat. "
"9569690","9573790"," We'd be screaming at him on live on air and be like, close your fucking short position."
"9574650","9575510"," And he wouldn't do it."
"9578470","9585450"," And I'm like, and I'm like, how you have to have balls of steel, like straight balls of steel to"
"9585450","9591830"," just be like, you know, like if we dump three to 500 points and we swing back up 300 points"
"9591830","9593250"," and he doesn't care. "
"9593570","9594470"," It's ballsies."
"9594770","9595670"," I don't know how he does it."
"9595930","9596890"," I couldn't do it. "
"9597570","9598130"," Fuck no."
"9604630","9607250"," Oh, so markets in mayhem has a stream now?"
"9607610","9608410"," I didn't know that."
"9610550","9611370"," I didn't know. "
"9611550","9613210"," I didn't know markets in mayhem had a stream."
"9614930","9616490"," Yeah, you remember that shit, Wankie?"
"9616990","9626070"," We'd be begging him and we'd be begging him and I'm gonna get fucking stopped here in a second."
"9627830","9629090"," This is killing me. "
"9629910","9630990"," I haven't been stopped yet."
"9631030","9631830"," I got another penny to go."
"9632190","9632630"," Two pennies. "
"9636540","9639580"," But we were all like, we were like, just take the money, man."
"9639760","9641040"," Like, take the fucking money."
"9644100","9649740"," Like, take the fucking money, fucking re-enter later. "
"9655700","9656740"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"9656880","9663220"," J.N.K. He notes, I've never been a, I never followed Wankie's alpha."
"9663520","9663780"," I should. "
"9665900","9668580"," We should ask him if he'd be willing to be on the stream."
"9670900","9672720"," I never followed him on Twitter too."
"9673040","9675000"," I see his posts all the time. "
"9675460","9678820"," People are always forwarding his posts to me."
"9684600","9685980"," I use both book maps."
"9685980","9687760"," All right, I've got both book maps. "
"9689600","9696740"," I've got E.S. on Thinkorswim and then I've got the big boy with Hero Indicator and all that set"
"9696740","9698400"," up with the spot gamma."
"9700340","9701560"," Keep on squeezing, baby."
"9702260","9702640"," Keep on squeezing. "
"9703320","9704420"," I didn't get cut out of that trade."
"9704800","9707300"," So, I'm gonna raise here to 60 cents."
"9710700","9713820"," So, I'm on 60 cents for a stop on 398Cs. "
"9718350","9720650"," We're going on up."
"9721150","9723330"," We're going on up."
"9723910","9726510"," We're moving on up like we should. "
"9727750","9728450"," Here we go."
"9728690","9730590"," Coming in some resistance, probably gonna get knocked out here."
"9731390","9735070"," I'm gonna put a post-book map over here for you so you can see some of this resistance we're"
"9735070","9735430"," coming into. "
"9736490","9737710"," This will be what, the third time."
"9739170","9740770"," We are long 398Cs."
"9740770","9745090"," Let's see what happens here. "
"9745170","9746430"," See if we can break on through or not."
"9747470","9748890"," Oh, I am showing you the book map."
"9749030","9750030"," Yes, contract right now. "
"9750710","9751850"," This is the free version."
"9752030","9753370"," This is the free stream for you guys."
"9757590","9761300"," I mean, I meant the 30th. "
"9761400","9762480"," I keep saying Friday now."
"9762560","9763920"," I know it's the 30th."
"9765240","9765940"," Papa Jerome. "
"9774590","9776150"," So, it's next Wednesday, not Friday."
"9777310","9779190"," Maybe I got my dates wrong."
"9781350","9787970"," Well, if it will to adjust the swing high and the swing high and Jerome Powell being negative on"
"9787970","9791730"," the markets from the 27th to the 30th. "
"9801790","9803190"," Keep on squeezing, baby."
"9803790","9805910"," All right, I've got a 60 cents stop."
"9806210","9808430"," I'm gonna move it up here to 65 cents. "
"9815110","9816570"," Hopefully you guys are following along."
"9820680","9822080"," We're moving on up here."
"9824420","9825300"," And I'm out. "
"9826160","9826720"," I'm flat again."
"9827320","9828120"," I just got cut out."
"9830140","9832080"," That's a fucking, that's not bad though. "
"9832280","9833400"," I'll take the, I'll take the, that's an L."
"9833760","9835020"," I mean, that's a W, not an L."
"9836280","9837940"," It's like a, I didn't make much off that."
"9838020","9842000"," I think it made, so let me check my fucking portfolio activity."
"9850020","9851700"," It only made 10 cents on that trade. "
"9854600","9859190"," I thought I was in like 30 cents or something."
"9859290","9862170"," I was in it like fucking 50 or 54 cents."
"9863430","9864270"," It wasn't that good. "
"9865530","9866970"," I thought I was in the 30s."
"9869230","9869990"," Yeah, it's okay."
"9874050","9876030"," Yeah, book map on think or swim is free. "
"9879580","9887760"," You, what you do is you call, we're probably moving up through right here."
"9887840","9888700"," I'm gonna reenter this trade."
"9893070","9894250"," Yeah, so just heads up. "
"9894370","9895470"," We are pretty bullish here right now."
"9895470","9896350"," I want you to see this, okay?"
"9897070","9900390"," We are starting to establish, we're gonna move up right now."
"9900410","9901550"," I'm gonna just buy in right now. "
"9901870","9903010"," I want to get, I want to miss this."
"9905990","9907430"," So we're likely gonna move up right here."
"9907490","9909270"," We are establishing a base here. "
"9910090","9911950"," Price target above is still valid."
"9912950","9914110"," Yep, 3998."
"9914670","9921530"," That actually translates to like, I think, 398.60. Keep that on your radar. "
"9924070","9931890"," Yeah, what you do is this is, I think you go to the support or whatever, however, I forget, it's"
"9931890","9937970"," called like chat, chat support, and you just go in there and tell them you want to try it out."
"9937970","9940730"," Say, I want to try out book map."
"9942750","9944090"," And here we go, we're going higher. "
"9945050","9947050"," I have to fucking put some stops in again."
"9951560","9953320"," I'm up 10 cents already in that trade."
"9954340","9955440"," So 65 cents. "
"9960380","9961960"," I mean, come on, let's start pushing."
"9968230","9971270"," I'm gonna take, I'm gonna make it 60, I'm gonna make it 70 cents."
"9972850","9974770"," I'm not gonna put it in until we go past it. "
"9976510","9984610"," Go to, sorry, I got to pay attention to this trade, go to, there's a chat option, go in the"
"9984610","9988810"," chat option, request say, I'm interested in book map, but I don't know anything about it or"
"9988810","9989030"," something."
"9989870","9991430"," I'll let you try it for free."
"9992750","10000650"," I wouldn't personally pay for book map through thinkorswim as they only use two exchanges, I think,"
"10000870","10001830"," one or two exchanges. "
"10003290","10013230"," If you go through book map themselves, it's complicated because if you"
"10013230","10018530"," go through book map proper, they have some great tools that you can use that thinkorswim doesn't."
"10018830","10023490"," They also offer more exchanges to get data from."
"10024710","10032630"," The other thing too is like if you're their order flow,"
"10033150","10041970"," it seems like it's slightly cleaner to trade the spy, so there's like cost better or there's like"
"10041970","10046350"," benefits to each side of the trade. "
"10046510","10051030"," If you look spy on the, I think I could open it up."
"10051090","10059170"," I've given another instance of book map with book map too, but they, I think it's easier to trade"
"10059170","10062430"," spy by using the MES order flow information."
"10064150","10071230"," But whatever the other one is called, I feel what it's called, but I got stopped out on that trade"
"10071230","10072370"," amount again. "
"10076190","10081290"," I do like the full book map for individual tickers, like I like looking at the book map with the"
"10081290","10089250"," Hero Indicator, and I've got some other tools that show like stink bids, fake bids that you can do"
"10089250","10090830"," for individual tickers."
"10091150","10092110"," That thing's kick ass."
"10092770","10098110"," The Hero Indicator does a really good job too of pre-showing the market, rolling over or making a"
"10098110","10098530"," move higher. "
"10102050","10108490"," But right now, I used to focus the last stream on mostly book map."
"10108490","10111950"," This stream is going to be mostly focused on other things."
"10111950","10113650"," We're focusing on a bunch of different stuff now. "
"10115150","10123530"," Traditional charting, TA, levels, setups, and then referring back to book map that confirm or deny"
"10123530","10125370"," what's happening."
"10128010","10129470"," Yeah, I think we're going to roll it here."
"10130410","10131370"," I think that was it. "
"10134390","10136170"," So I'm not going to enter any other trades from here."
"10136330","10138510"," I think we're going to roll over the rest of the day if I had to guess."
"10142580","10144620"," If there was a time that I put, that was probably it. "
"10149660","10154840"," At least till at least till 3 p.m. And I'm flat right now if you guys want to know."
"10155400","10158160"," If you're stuck in calls right now, there might be another move up to get out of calls."
"10159000","10160100"," I'll switch back so you can see. "
"10161320","10163100"," That's probably top right here."
"10164140","10169500"," You might get another push to unfuck yourself in here for a downtrend."
"10169820","10173400"," I'm assuming here that goals have reached exhaustion. "
"10177310","10179050"," Let me know in the chat if you think so as well."
"10182050","10183030"," Yeah, as it's support."
"10187590","10188450"," Still, if I'm C."
"10188570","10190490"," George, P.2.15 p.m. Bloor to Tuber. "
"10190810","10192450"," Yeah, I'm not really concerned with the speakers."
"10192830","10194490"," I'm more concerned with selling the minutes."
"10195670","10199410"," And then my take is that initially it's going to come off as dovish. "
"10200610","10207890"," And what the minutes say is that J.P.I. was so hawkish in his interview because meeting I think"
"10207890","10208810"," was very dovish."
"10209110","10214550"," But I think that it's going to roll the market over in a bad way."
"10215770","10219490"," I think what's hawkish or what's dovish is hawkish for the stock market. "
"10224400","10225980"," Yeah, I'm not I'm not entering here."
"10226220","10227480"," I don't care if we go up from this point."
"10228560","10233940"," It might if so if you want to know my view here, let's take a look at the chart. "
"10235280","10236680"," We could make this move up here."
"10236720","10237960"," We could make one more move up here."
"10238240","10239780"," Of course, this is on the table. "
"10239960","10242940"," What I don't like is I don't like the exhaustion that's taking place."
"10244940","10245880"," We could go up here."
"10246180","10246960"," You can see that happening. "
"10247500","10248820"," I have no interest in it."
"10249900","10252440"," I don't like the idea of distribution starting here."
"10252980","10253860"," This is exhausting. "
"10258220","10259660"," I've got no I've got no interest."
"10261320","10264060"," And I'll show you in book back what I'm seeing here."
"10264540","10267120"," And you can see that in light volume is good. "
"10267240","10268620"," We can we can go places with light volume."
"10269640","10271280"," I'm just not I have no interest here."
"10271680","10277040"," I want you to see this block of sellers here at 390 3990. "
"10279020","10280220"," Pretty substantial block."
"10280800","10282540"," 291 sell orders."
"10284820","10286640"," And then another 213 above it. "
"10289680","10292080"," If you are still long calls right here, you didn't have stops."
"10292800","10299260"," We're coming into a place for you to take your money and run or hold on."
"10299640","10300440"," Don't listen to me. "
"10300580","10303940"," Do you want to go long and fucking diamond hand it to the end of the day?"
"10304080","10305680"," I understand 100%."
"10305680","10308020"," You take your own risk on the market."
"10309480","10314500"," I'm going to be looking for another rejection above here somewhere right here. "
"10315340","10322080"," This is where I think we reject right in there somewhere."
"10324420","10326160"," So we'll see if we reject here or not."
"10332300","10337560"," But don't listen to me because I know you get some of you guys are like you fuckers will dive"
"10337560","10340900"," in hand to the fucking end end of the day till they're worthless. "
"10344520","10347080"," It's like it's like puts you hold them till they're worthless, right?"
"10350500","10358140"," And I'll put up a book map for you so you can see support resistance or there's no support."
"10358380","10358800"," We're just running."
"10358960","10360440"," We're just running hot right now. "
"10366350","10367890"," Let me know if you're still long calls."
"10369330","10371030"," That was your chance right there to get out."
"10371950","10374550"," Just as a heads up you had calls and you wanted to get out. "
"10374650","10376670"," That was it somewhere somewhere here."
"10379780","10384420"," Yeah, you have to log off and then log back in when you log off and log back in on"
"10384420","10387980"," the top of your desktop."
"10388560","10389080"," Watch my cursor. "
"10390220","10396400"," You have your charts, flexible grid, product step and then you'll see book map pop back up on your"
"10398680","10405000"," pop back up on your it'll ask you do you want to try me yes I think or yes."
"10406980","10411620"," Try it open it up and the initial settings are okay."
"10411620","10416000"," I don't know if there are many videos on how to do the settings for thinkorswim. "
"10416100","10417040"," We could go through them one day."
"10417440","10422380"," I could do like a little video with you guys on a slow day or after the market closed one"
"10422380","10425960"," of these days if you wanted me to go through and show you all the options on book map I"
"10425960","10428860"," could so that you can set yours up."
"10430380","10431980"," There are some videos out there. "
"10433340","10437800"," If you are going to make changes on your instance of book map that you have open or that you"
"10437800","10442920"," have I do recommend let's say you watch a youtube video on it I would always recommend that you"
"10442920","10448780"," watch the youtube video first all the way through to make sure that that's how you want your book"
"10448780","10454420"," map set up before you go in and just start messing with settings you can get lost you know and"
"10454420","10459300"," you come back and you're like shit I don't like this setup I would always watch like a setup video"
"10459300","10464980"," first start to finish and then maybe watch two or three different setups to find the one you would"
"10464980","10473940"," like to try and the setup for book map on thinkorswim is different than"
"10473940","10481120"," through book map it has none of the power that the real book map has I want you to know"
"10481120","10491900"," that like probably has like 30 to 40 percent of the actual power of legit book map and if"
"10491900","10499500"," you trade if you the good thing about thinkorswim though the cost like I pay 400 and I think it's"
"10499500","10509060"," 460 total I used to pay like five or six hundred because I was paying for the me s contracts"
"10509060","10518940"," off I think three exchanges and then I was paying for the cash market data plus two or"
"10518940","10526320"," three tools I'm paying for a package of tools I think my total cost is it's up there man it's"
"10526320","10532720"," like almost 500 bucks I'm gonna put that it's I'm gonna put that book map up for you guys but"
"10532720","10538480"," I need to set up I'm gonna set up a patreon so that it can it can get paid for"
"10538480","10542480"," so you guys don't actually have to pay for it the cool part about that is what we'll do is"
"10542480","10550660"," we'll we'll run that book map for you guys and we'll come on early in the morning or through the"
"10550660","10559420"," slow day and we'll check out your favorite tickers so if you're like I love tesla we'll stop in and"

"10583940","10594100"," bunch of cool there's a bunch of cool shit we can check fake bids on tickers stuff like that the"
"10598160","10606820"," other cool thing is that's expensive is fucking the one of the last original squawk boxes is called"
"10606820","10613380"," trade the news and they're like 400 or 500 bucks a week from our nose a month 450 a month"

"11358590","11368530"," so um it's and the long term it doesn't pay to be bearish"
"11368530","11375950"," in the long term do i think do i think this is bad for i mean it's forming a bottom"
"11375950","11380270"," i don't like that it's down here i want to see that that that rejection and then i move higher"
"11380670","11385970"," the longer we trade sideways like this the more of a chance that we go down now we're getting close"
"11385970","11391150"," to it so you can see it uh the levels have changed for today but i do remember from the"
"11391150","11398090"," levels that i put up this morning that you don't want to see um you want to see us above"
"11398090","11405290"," do you want to get bullish above 170 53 i think it is uh so i'm not bullish here until"
"11405290","11411510"," we get above it that's that's the that's the facts and until we get above it we were above it"
"11411510","11417390"," this morning i think it was a 170 53 i could be wrong there um i don't have the numbers"
"11417390","11422730"," right in front of me right now but you so i think briefly we're above it see once once you"
"11422730","11426710"," get above it so we're above i'm going to show you if we get above here fuck yeah i'll get"
"11426710","11432370"," i'll get bullish to 213 or so i think it's i think it's 213 than bullish too but uh you"
"11432370","11439330"," have to have certain uh you we react right we don't act uh we react to certain events and even"
"11439330","11444610"," though i'm bullish on tesla above 170 now that we've broken through and cash market the thoughts"
"11444610","11454150"," and prayers thing uh i'm overall bearish on tesla i think you do no matter what uh see um 90s"
"11454150","11462090"," at least at some point but you guys aren't seeing the chart with me you guys are looking at book"
"11462090","11468310"," map and i'm looking at tesla so i'll bring you back over so you want to you want to a"
"11468310","11478170"," tesla update so we'll look back at tesla here um so tesla uh this trend right this downward"
"11478170","11484550"," trend right here see this yellow line and you see this white line right here this is the where the"
"11484550","11490510"," pivot is for tesla today i think it was 170 53 if i can't remember off top my head what"
"11490510","11495930"," i posted this morning uh so you want to see tesla trade above this to get bit bullish at least"
"11495930","11502730"," in the short term and we saw that briefly this morning and then it traded below now some bulls are"
"11502730","11508210"," going to call this uh consolidation for a rip higher uh possibly i still wouldn't take the trade"
"11508210","11513670"," until we trade above it and we're not right now so the longer that we stay below this pivot uh"
"11513670","11521230"," the more the the chances are that we're going to trade lower uh that it's not done going down can"
"11521230","11530310"," we trade lower here abs to fucking loot we can tesla trade decouple from tech uh Nasdaq and spy"
"11530310","11534930"," so many times in the past we've seen this happen with tesla we've seen it happen with facebook"
"11534930","11540030"," we've seen it happen or meta now so it's not like you can't um see us be aware of that"
"11540030","11547890"," as well as we head into um the close today uh tesla can totally fucking decouple and uh you know"
"11547890","11553390"," you get cathy woods just start selling out of her positions and it'll become public in a week or"
"11553390","11560090"," two uh so yeah if you want to know just to this tesla go up uh yesterday it was lower"
"11560090","11566230"," and today it's higher yesterday uh the pivot point uh at the end of the day was oh excuse me"
"11566230","11569970"," there wasn't no the pivot point was way up here at the end of the day but yesterday we wanted"
"11569970","11578430"," to see i think 167 50 46 get tagged it didn't it got tagged uh in uh low liquidity hours"
"11578430","11586410"," right pre market uh hours that's not good see it happening in cash market we saw it happen today we"
"11586410","11591890"," saw the volume spike which is positive for tesla so that's got all that going for it do i think"
"11591890","11596130"," we go up here sure but i wouldn't be taking it i wouldn't be taking it long until we break"
"11596130","11603970"," above 170 um or i would have taken it long this morning at 168 that's not a bad trade either"
"11603970","11610720"," but for right here right now if you if you uh below this uh below this white line i'd say"
"11610720","11618280"," sure stay in your trade uh put stuff put stops on your trade um does that make sense so oftentimes"
"11618280","11625800"," traders are you know oftentimes traders last question like uh they'll be like well i entered the"
"11625800","11631920"," trade here and i'm like no no no no you were supposed to enter the trade when we're breaking"
"11631920","11640710"," through um so if you were entered down here broke breaking below you should be not sweating"
"11640710","11646990"," anything does that make sense so you're always waiting to the wrong time to enter a trade and then"
"11646990","11654830"," questioning or self-doubting um so the trade was the trade to go long is below uh this this uh"
"11654830","11660070"," s3 right to not listen to the bears and take the and then if you're going to then enter the"
"11660070","11668550"," trade a second time it's above 170 uh with confirmation and that would be the same trade uh then"
"11668550","11674830"," that's the same trade for i think it's 170-53 so if we break below that s3 take the long"
"11674830","11679710"," and i would tell you the same time you take this long to here and then you're going to reassess"
"11679710","11689670"," if you're going to take it long from there so it's saying hey where do you think we're"
"11689670","11694950"," going from here that's insane you take take it uh you know from level to level right does that make"
"11694950","11700010"," sense um so where does it go i don't think it matters where it goes i think if i think"
"11700010","11706010"," if you if you took the long and tesla low uh you shouldn't have any problems or sweating you you"
"11706010","11711790"," do you do have to consider this this downtrend right here you can see here here here it's got more"
"11711790","11717890"," seller pressure pomo sellers are above right now trying to push it down late pomo sellers to the"
"11717890","11725290"," party um the real sellers probably want to sell it higher probably want to sell it up in here uh"
"11725290","11731070"," so if i was a bear i wouldn't want to be short anywhere in here they want to be short"
"11731070","11739510"," up here uh so it's on your side that we're going up here if you're long and tesla um"
"11739510","11746810"," on a short term basis but if we start to trade below here if you start to trade below this"
"11746810","11753250"," thoughts and prayers thing over here uh you have to cut your lungs if we start you start trailing"
"11753250","11758170"," off and at the end of the day you start seeing this nonsense you've got your stops right there so"
"11758170","11766310"," that you're not caught in it you should be directionally buying as the move is happening uh you if"
"11766310","11770390"," any of you out there are listening to me right now if you are the kind of if you're an"
"11770390","11778710"," emotional trader uh where you if you are constantly on the wrong side of a trade i would highly"
"11778710","11788510"," recommend that you turn most of social media up i would turn off CNBC i would"
"11788510","11796650"," turn off twitter i would turn off most of it if you are listening to anybody that's telling you um"
"11796650","11805610"," i don't know like we're going to the moon right now that's all they're saying uh you want to like"
"11805610","11810270"," you want to be in the move before it happens you want to be listening to people that are trying"
"11810270","11817230"," to anticipate what the next move is correctly follow those people uh you want to be because let's"
"11817230","11822090"," say so like let's say we squeeze up here today so if we squeeze up into this bell right here"
"11822090","11828950"," right my whole thought process is where do i start taking a short here this is all i'm looking for"
"11828950","11837590"," up here this is my whole focus like right up here 439.99 where do i short for 4000 that"
"11837590","11844590"," that that's so um where is that 404 is it a how long how much time do i put on"
"11844590","11849170"," it as we come up into this area um so my that's should be our focus so you're thinking like"
"11849170","11856270"," 2D chess 3D chess like uh where's my next price target next price targets here right um we can can"
"11856270","11861830"," slap each other in the back afterwards um but this is directly what we're looking for what's my"
"11861830","11865890"," next price target after there i'm looking to short the market here this is what i'm looking for pre "
"11865890","11873290","-planning what what's going to happen um not letting this happen and then buying calls now right"
"11873290","11879850"," does it make sense like oh now that we're here this is what traders fall into they're like they"
"11879850","11884630"," wait they see this happen they're not in a trade but then when they get here they go well fucking"
"11884630","11890170"," i'm buying calls now and you so you know what i'm saying the move's already over so this is called"
"11890170","11897310"," putting risk on in a trade right so you have to risk money to make money um and so the"
"11897310","11902970"," same thing applies to tesla yesterday people were saying no don't buy that dip on tesla and i was"
"11902970","11909870"," like no we're we're at a book we're at a bottom on tesla some kind of a bottom localized short "
"11909870","11915870","-term bottom so you buy this bottom and then you monitor your trade and say okay is this going to"
"11915870","11919870"," go up we're gonna we're gonna sling shot up i'm looking for certain things i'm looking for this"
"11919870","11925210"," break below here even if it's only brief i might not catch it because it should be fast it should"
"11925210","11929610"," be a hammer candle of some kind and then we should have a quick move up now we have not"
"11929610","11936410"," met the all those uh we've not met all of those uh circumstances right we didn't break below and"
"11936410","11943190"," tag through our our bottom level we did it today though right it was really fast move up so nine"
"11943190","11948210"," times out of ten traders not gonna catch that so we are already in the trade long right and now"
"11948210","11951750"," our second thing we're looking for is a move higher and"
"11951750","11961550"," we're looking if you're long tesla here what are you looking for you're"
"11961550","11965930"," looking to break above this this yellow trend if you can't break this trend as you head into close"
"11965930","11973370"," it's likely going to continue down into the next into the next levels so that makes sense but this"
"11973370","11981130"," is called putting risk on what this is not called is uh where we're at this bottom down here right"
"11981130","11987150"," and we trade up 30 points and then you throw some calls on and it rolls over and you say"
"11987150","11994290"," ah you think it's going up from here does that make sense um that's what you have that's kind of"
"11994290","11998790"," what you have to do you put the risk on you monitor you put some stops in and you look"
"11998790","12007150"," for certain signs in that ticker to present themselves for where you're headed if you do that"
"12007150","12013390"," you'll save yourself a bunch of headaches you'll save yourself a bunch of um and you can move your"
"12013390","12019110"," stop-ups if you bought anywhere down in here and you're raising you're raising these up right so I"
"12019110","12024950"," think myself I put that alert out here yesterday right so right here right now so if you bought"
"12024950","12030530"," yesterday as call spread and you have your alert your stops right here you say I have to have"
"12030530","12036570"," picked the right direction um you have to decide for yourself how much risk you want to put in a"
"12036570","12042670"," swing lower so you might say oh I'm gonna put stops up here at 168 cap or I'm willing to"
"12042670","12051090"," take a swing lower of a 5% loss on spreads right maybe it's down here and you swung down"
"12051090","12057250"," you swung up you swung down that's because Russia is not ready for peace talks but if you start if"
"12057250","12064190"," you start like wham no wham no Russia is not ready for peace talks that's what you don't want to"
"12064190","12070250"," see you don't want to see like the attempt to get up to break out didn't work another attempt to"
"12070250","12077130"," break out and this right here is bearish does that make sense sponsored by tics right tics right"

"16350430","16357670"," more sellers step it in so this article that came out it was it was in conjunction with spakema and"
"16357670","16363470"," the nasdaq and they wrote this article last week i posted on twitter i was like i was like this"
"16363470","16372090"," kind of fucked up i was like i looked at the cme data and it showed it showed pretty much"
"16372090","16381790"," the top was 410 and all those puts hadn't even expired yet and the market makers reset"
"16381790","16389590"," all puts to uh basically neutral an implied move of we went for an implied move of or or went"
"16389590","16394529"," yeah we're gonna apply all the implied move higher to 410 was reset down to 400 then the move lower"
"16394529","16400930"," was the 380 and the mark nothing had changed in the market no new calls no new puts or whatever"
"16400930","16405509"," so basically dealers just reset the entire fucking market into middle of december and just said"
"16405509","16411790"," fuck you and fuck all your calls and puts and it kind of happened before the fact so then spakema"
"16411790","16417189"," did an article with him and it looked like a spakema was a puff piece trying to explain it was"
"16417189","16424570"," it's like willing out art art art cashew and saying this is why the market's going up when in"
"16424570","16431130"," reality it's that we're not paying this shit regardless so it's just kind of funny to read the"
"16431130","16436910"," article i want to find it posted for you because it was a scam piece and it was more scammy"
"16436910","16446349"," that spakema and nazdak had done it together it was kind of like gross so what what i wondered was"
"16446349","16455130"," i wondered if spakema had reached out to nazdak for comment or had seen the manipulation behind the"
"16455130","16459349"," scenes and reached out for comment and maybe naz i shouldn't say this stuff because it's all"
"16459349","16465950"," conjecture but my thought was that uh Brent probably fucking reached out to him and said we've got"
"16465950","16470210"," this data can you explain it to us and the nazdak was like what if we do a puff piece"
"16470210","16479849"," on you like a blog post and uh we'll let this we'll just sweep this under the carpet"

"16551950","16557890"," yeah so well so the max pain sites my point behind that is this is that the the max pain"
"16557890","16562450"," number changes throughout the course of a day and every once in a while there's some manipulation"
"16562450","16567689"," that goes on to reset it as well because i point uh so there's like two aspects to the max"
"16567689","16574050"," pain numbers and if you look at a max pain site they might not be updating it to reflect uh"
"16574050","16582590"," real time what the max pain numbers is i've seen max pain numbers uh move 100 points uh in the"
"16582590","16591310"," middle of a day which is highly unusual and suspect especially on like the fucking spy it is not it"

"23418550","23425330"," rephrase that i think that the minutes are gonna be hawkish or excuse me davish that is bad for the"

"23434970","23440150"," i think i think j-pow might have to support the markets by being hawkish which is kind of bizarre"
"23440150","23446650"," to say uh i know this is all inverse of what you think uh at any rate that doesn't really"

"23460270","23465830"," take your profit here right if you're a bull and you don't do anything into tomorrow you look for a"
"23465830","23471550"," dip to buy if you're a bear i would recommend to put spread if you want to get some zero "
"23471550","23478030","-day puts i would recommend not buying them until four fifteen four fourteen p.m. today i would not"

"23495530","23501370"," if you want to see if you want to the reason i'm saying that is because uh there's horse straight"
"23501370","23505570"," and in the after or the first 15 minutes of spy there's some horse trade that goes on you can"
"23505570","23510850"," see a quick rip up into four fifteen they get over four hundred and then you buy your puts and"
"23510850","23516050"," we get down plus it's low volume so uh options become cheaper sometimes with low volume there's not"
"23516050","23524730"," as much demand for them if you want to sleep tonight i would say be flat if they leaked anything"
