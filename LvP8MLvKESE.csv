"661380","666460"," You're gonna make money on a bounce there But this is not the place for you to buy a dip"
"666460","674000"," is it so What is a place for you to buy the dip is let me make this simple here,"

"735660","744560"," Now sometimes that bit by does work Sometimes it doesn't I know for a fact that It doesn't bounce"
"744560","753040"," enough For it doesn't bounce enough for you to be right most of the time so Whenever it does sell"
"753040","762320"," off or like in the inverse or even in the even in this situation When it does hold Then you're"
"762320","766980"," buying it right here the one time it does hold or three times you look like you knew what you're"
"766980","773080"," talking about But then you disappear The other 70% of the time that it didn't work Same thing holds"
"773080","779340"," true on the upside too It's oftentimes why I don't trust traders that tell me shit in the in the"
"779340","783920"," chat no offense to you in the chat I love you love the chat, but so you have different voices"
"783920","790620"," that show up On that on that three out of ten chance that they won so if you just follow"
"790620","797760"," the rules you'll be right Well 80% of the time that much It'd be right like eight out of"
"797760","807380"," ten times Rather than being right one out of three out of ten times as an example, so As we"
"807380","812000"," sell off down here we'll get back to the triggers in just a minute and the velocity and all that"
"812000","816900"," kind of stuff So as they sell off down here, if you're a bull, what are you looking for?"
"818520","826080"," You're gonna be looking for some kind of a bounce, right a bounce down here Right or in a reversal"
"826080","828700"," to even enter along so just look at where we are right now."
"828920","830260"," Are you trying to buy this dip?"

"863780","865220"," We know about this box. "
"865540","869620"," You don't mess around in here Right broke through it already."
"870220","871920"," They're gonna reverse it right down on you."
"872000","877260"," We're gonna slam into this right likely slam into this Now, how do you buy that tip?"
"877420","878540"," I just already told you right?"
"878960","887860"," I already told you so You already know that you have to get a reversal above 4419 you already have"
"887860","896020"," the The bear plane serving itself up to clear out all this all these pivots down below Let's just"
"896020","898560"," say we let's say we roll keep rolling down here, right?"
"899420","900880"," Squeeze up a little bit here. "
"901200","909260"," We roll but no, I'll just draw it out Let's pretend to get this nice big fat green bar up"
"909260","919100"," here We'll just do a bar by bar You get the reverse down here Right, and then you come right"
"919100","926100"," down here bloodbath and you bounce There goes your red line I guess you could try to buy that if"
"926100","931160"," you wanted I bet it keeps bleeding down not guaranteed But fair chances just keeps bleeding down"
"931820","941020"," But you need to see that you or you need to see To that reverses down here you blast down"
"941760","950180"," Right, and then it actually reverse and you get the big green bars down here Right big big pull up"
"950180","955260"," higher You already know that you need to see the white line come up right when the white there"
"955260","961720"," Yeah, you already know you need to see that happen right red white Price confirms and then starts"
"961720","964520"," to hit higher and that's your entry over there."
"964600","965220"," Does that make sense?"
"965800","968660"," You don't get caught if we start to consolidate here."
"968840","972080"," Do you you're not taking trades in here if this happens?"
"972660","975240"," In case we continue down to the downside, right?"
"975920","980860"," You're like you have to wait until that reversal happens for you to confirm the move higher It's"
"980860","986220"," very critical and matter of fact even right now you get in that green that green bar right now On"
"986220","992520"," this chart you're looking for this rejection right here Now, let's say we reverse here, right?"
"992800","996900"," Let's just look at this real quiz a five minute chart Let's pretend that we reverse here. "
"997300","999120"," So we get the green bar right here, right?"
"1000220","1004760"," Here, you know, we're getting this green bar and you get another green bar right here, right?"
"1006140","1015940"," You already know that this is going to reverse Right there It's gonna send you back down over here"
"1015940","1025460"," and then you're still looking and waiting like you are waiting for price to Confirm"
"1025460","1034280"," the 27 EMA Right to start to talk about this move higher and you're looking for this hourly trigger"
"1034280","1042960"," to have come up To provide the needed support to push us actually above the daily trigger So we'll"
"1042960","1052800"," watch this right now How y'all doing Yeah, it's a reminder of basics so"
"1054380","1059700"," We did great on the open this morning smashed up into the daily trigger smashed up there again"
"1059700","1060900"," We're likely not done."
"1060980","1062040"," I'm bullshare by the way."
"1062100","1065060"," It's just a matter of Consolidating and heading higher. "
"1065320","1066580"," So I'm not bearish here."
"1066680","1075840"," You want to know I'm extremely bullish so Well, let's take a look at the let's take a look back"
"1075840","1085660"," at that chart again that I was just showing you You This is a 30 minute bar chart you want"
"1085660","1090220"," to use a 30 minute chart 30 minute a one minute or a five You can use one and five"
"1090220","1093500"," a 30 minute We'll talk about a trend as well."
"1093820","1100400"," What our early trend means what what a four hour trend means that kind of stuff And we're gonna"
"1100400","1104800"," take a look we're a little bit longer the tooth here and a little bit more push we can go"
"1104800","1108940"," here There's a little bit more we can go higher higher with but it looks more like this right now"
"1108940","1114820"," something like this and then that push higher Right you've also get that next failure point above"
"1114820","1122820"," at 444 in some change It's called like 444 25 And what we really need here is I'm gonna show"
"1122820","1124880"," it to what I'm gonna show exactly what we're looking for here. "
"1125240","1132220"," I want you to see this push higher here Right right up it over and then it didn't hold right"
"1133000","1137040"," We don't want that we don't want to repeat of that do we we don't want to like a whoop"
"1137040","1145160"," Up here, and then a roll down right a failure We don't like that kind of stuff."
"1145180","1151240"," I kind of want to see you're a bull what you're looking for here is We have a second here"
"1153840","1157580"," You know you've got this volatility up here is pretty big ball, right?"
"1158460","1162940"," You got these sellers say they there's telling you they're right here, and they're telling you"
"1162940","1167900"," they're right here still We're trying to sell that off that they're stronger than the one in five"
"1167900","1182660"," minute And you're saying yeah, we're not quite done here so You"
"1182660","1190280"," we think that we think that buyers are right here if they're successful they should take us up"
"1190280","1198880"," right here Take us back down right here right another failure above here And then back down here"
"1198880","1200240"," until the hourly comes up."
"1200280","1206740"," I'm gonna snap that right there for a reason the expectation here would be that the That the hourly"
"1206740","1216760"," holds Right pushes a sub higher to trade that right there The hourly has continuation Right"
"1216760","1226710"," and then you get the hourly above the daily And this is this is all good stuff"
"1226710","1227190"," here, right?"
"1227370","1231250"," You got the hourly above the daily you got one and five And it's kind of your only chance if"

"5264560","5269660"," I'm going to explain it to you simply Uh is for me to make a 15 to 20 minute video"
"5269660","5278460"," that's recorded every night it's not too live stream or to live stream say on twitch And then to"
"5278460","5286920"," record a video on youtube every night So not to a live stream on youtube youtube is very anti Live"

"5307000","5313180"," hours Uh, I decide i'm going to stream for two to three hours one trade a day And then I"

"5462980","5469560"," days, uh, time time by myself Uh, not doing what I should be doing, right?"
"5470320","5476780"," So this we're not done here The other thing is that i've received many emails over the past two and"
"5476780","5481320"," a half three years to be sponsored Now, I don't think you understand what that means, but i'm going"

"5590260","5598320"," So more companies have contacted me over the past three years And I've said no to every single one"
"5598320","5603540"," of them So even if I didn't want to change the formats or I wanted to just keep doing what"
"5603540","5609080"," I was doing or I didn't want to do it hit the Algorithms, I could still make some deals and"
"5609080","5616320"," collect money Significant money like you're what I'm just said and done somewhere around Uh five or"
"5616320","5618820"," ten k a week Something like that."
"5619000","5624040"," It's a ton of money Uh, and I could easily do a you know, I could easily get these companies"
"5624040","5631360"," to pay me Um and easily roll this stuff into fin to it So I would like highlight a let's"
"5631360","5637600"," say trady tick says an example chart every day on on fin to it Uh, I could I could monetize"
"5637600","5641380"," my discord right now Do you understand that like today?"
"5642260","5649700"," Like today I could go into my discord today And begin to charge for you to be in my discord"
"5650440","5651240"," Do you understand?"
"5652140","5661200"," Like today Uh, I think I have 1,800 people on that discord So if I was to charge today"
"5661200","5667000"," Uh, let's say Just for the maintenance fee for the time and effort that everybody puts in there"
"5667460","5671540"," Probably get what five bucks 10 bucks 20 bucks I've been at a minimum."
"5671600","5677260"," I could get 10 bucks and most people would stay in that discord Uh, let's figure out what that I"
"5677260","5678220"," don't even know what that is. "
"5678440","5679160"," Uh, what is that?"
"5679400","5680300"," What does that come out to?"
"5681260","5689420"," I got a calculator here Just talk about captain jim james making money On you as the viewer."
"5689900","5692300"," So let's see we've got I think we've got 1,800 in there."
"5692680","5697300"," Let's see We only kept a 1,500 Then we charge 10 bucks a month. "
"5697460","5698860"," It seems pretty reasonable, right?"
"5699440","5707260"," That's $15,000 a month 15 grand a month That's more than most of you make a year, right?"
"5708100","5708580"," What is that?"
"5709220","5715620"," Uh, I don't know what that is 130,000 or something every year every no 160 30,000 something like"
"5715620","5719780"," that Every year I could bring in from just my discord."
"5720260","5725240"," That's it Uh, why have why why have I not monetized that?"
"5725800","5734620"," So you have zero sponsors on this show You have a free discord then Uh, every morning believe it or"
"5734620","5743660"," not every morning Every single morning I post levels for you on Uh, at captain's alpha, right?"
"5744040","5749640"," This does cheesiest Tony cheesiest do that for you I'm going to assume that's a big fat fucking no"

"5948750","5958010"," do this My channel I don't even check this shows you how much this shows you how much I even"
"5958010","5968520"," know how much money comes in I don't even know how to look at this stuff Um,"
"5968680","5979620"," my channel my studio maybe Let me check and see Uh, is it under earn money I"

"5990660","5993180"," this part because it shows my ads sense account number. "
"5993440","6000980"," Maybe it's under analytics Yeah, so let's look at this one."
"6001160","6009380"," Let me see if I can show you this Um Um Let me see what I can cut pace here."
"6009400","6022150"," Hold on Oh, hold"
"6022150","6022430"," on here. "
"6022430","6032210"," So we bring this over here So I think this is my monthly"
"6032210","6037330"," estimated revenue here Let's bring this up."
"6037330","6040210"," Oh Does that make sense for you?"
"6040310","6046730"," So that's my that's my monthly estimated revenue Uh thousand bucks So that's that's that's I think"
"6046730","6050210"," that's your monthly Revenue, so that's 200."
"6050570","6060290"," I believe $250 a week Why would I stream to you for 250 dollars a week that that"
"6060290","6064550"," money Um I have to pay taxes on it, right?"
"6064770","6070970"," That's not doing anything right so that leaves 700 for the month Uh, so that's not 250 week is it?"
"6072390","6073650"," I don't know what that is. "
"6073890","6074750"," It's really bad."
"6075170","6081490"," It's like under $200 a week So, uh, I guess I guess that's what I'm doing for the past three"
"6081490","6089690"," years I've been trying to make $200 a week from you That doesn't account for my costs doesn't"
"6089690","6096230"," account for any of the things that have to buy Uh Paper trading in the background with that money,"
"6096230","6101350"," uh, and then I blow it up every week or something Uh, so I don't think that I'm here."
"6101510","6106810"," I guess the point I'm trying to make too is that Why would I stream to you for three almost"
"6106810","6108690"," three years for $200 a week?"
"6109410","6114610"," Uh, when I could monetize this Uh, I don't know why I would do that. "
"6114810","6116730"," Uh, how do I live?"
"6117030","6120210"," I guess Uh off of that."
"6120750","6125070"," Um, if I was if I was renting a house or I don't know owning a house How do I"
"6125070","6127030"," keep the lights on with their 200 a week?"
"6127030","6133010"," Because it's this is something that's supposed to keep me entertained Uh for two years, uh, I doubt"
"6133010","6141690"," that so You know, let's talk about, uh the mon monetizing in paper trading and paying all of my"
"6141690","6150030"," bills, uh, so that Tony cheesiest Who at Tony cheesiest, uh, I don't know."

"6256030","6260990"," there's a few of you here that know that I have to um Trading view accounts."
"6261230","6261810"," Do you know those costs?"
"6262130","6265970"," I don't know I don't know what they cost 500 600 for a year That's why I don't pay monthly. "

"6336110","6344290"," half hour trigger Uh, I think there's still more down to go possibly two 440 41 And that's where"
"6344290","6348830"," the hourly trigger is now if we are going to reverse here We're going to take a look and see"
"6348830","6355390"," what that should look like So we're on the half hour trigger right here and I personally think we"

"6356230","6363610"," We get that one more blast down here Okay Um I think you get one more blast down here now"

"6369190","6376050"," reversion up here Uh, this is what you're looking for right looking for that quick reversal you're"
"6376050","6384570"," looking for Uh, the five minutes to come over and for price to begin to reverse to the upside Right"
"6384570","6391890"," right up here and then you start blasting higher right there Now we'll take that trade if we can"
"6391890","6398230"," get up here somewhere in there and look for that reversal to try to Trade back above and this stuff"
"6398230","6404250"," here and this stuff here otherwise Now what it does look like to me Is consolidation until the"

"6410610","6411050"," higher higher."

"6593840","6599260"," help me to monetize Uh, the point I'm trying to make here is that the moment that I do monetize"
"6599260","6606900"," or I make too much money or I charge you guys Uh, I probably won't uh trade as much."
"6607440","6614100"," So if that happens, uh, I'll actually stop trading and tell you so I guess I guess I don't know"

"6919920","6924760"," trade here on the left hand side still not on a trade Uh, but I want to see if we"
"6924760","6930100"," can do this nice quick reversal here off this affire Uh, what I don't want to see is the push"
"6930100","6935120"," up higher and then the the roll back down for that last little bit down here To close that gap"
"6935120","6940340"," to the downside Um, so we're gonna we're gonna watch these right on the trade in 18 cents right now"
"6940820","6947200"," Now there is a quick trade for you if you're looking for one Is a one-minute chart that we're"
"6947200","6957100"," on right now you can take that trade to that moment If you're feeling bullish If If there's a"
"6957100","6967000"," squeeze squeeze higher Should get like one more right here One more"
"6967000","6976800"," right there It's our one and then back up here to a failure Uh, you"
"6976800","6980980"," don't you don't stay long in here, but you can pick it back up again if we do break above"
"6980980","6990220"," it Soon bring that back so you can see it So first trades kind of dead here"
"6990220","6999200"," if there is a squeeze higher and a successful bounce Maybe maybe take that trade right there and"
"6999200","7010000"," we'll look for that continuation to the upside Hmm"
"7011840","7017380"," Uh, the reason why you guys don't see my Trading account I'm reading what some about fake trades. "
"7017800","7026080"," So a couple a couple key points here, okay So I used to show my trading account I people I"
"7026080","7027220"," know people can fake trades."
"7027460","7033860"," So Uh, there's a couple of things of faking trades a bunch of stuff about faking trades Uh, I can"
"7033860","7040900"," paper trade this in the background Uh up and down so I could take a put position And a call"
"7040900","7046760"," position and at the end of the day Show you the one that's the winner does that make sense?"
"7047080","7053580"," That's a way it's a way that streamers Uh people on fin to it do things Uh, they don't actually"
"7053580","7060160"," tell you before this is a key point before not after The set the other thing they used to do"
"7060160","7070120"," is they used to actually Upload photos of printouts from my uh brokerages to prove my trades Now I"
"7070120","7077940"," have had one brokerage broken into at this point So I do I no longer show my trading account to"
"7077940","7085000"," actually keep it on a separate computer as well Uh, it's even separate from my streaming So if I"
"7085000","7091120"," had somebody break into youtube and take over my youtube They would not have access to the computer"
"7091120","7096140"," that I trade on So these days as a streamer, well, it's not just a streamer."
"7096140","7103700"," We're not done there Uh, with streaming I have to take extra precautions Uh with the names of my"
"7103700","7111860"," family like the full names of my family exactly where I live Uh screenshots were At so when I first"
"7111860","7117340"," started trading Uh, I didn't actually show accounts that I traded on but I did show accounts that"

"7189580","7197460"," They shut my account down for that um but it happens so Even my face being here, uh, even my"
"7197460","7207780"," voice being real at some point And the next five to ten years, uh, likely can't have it Uh"
"7208460","7214520"," There because of the the dawn of ai and deep fakes and all that kind of stuff You could as"
"7214520","7215960"," a matter of fact, this is from fucked up shit."

"7245880","7251700"," we have to use these passwords And that's because of deep fakes So you're getting to squeeze right"
"7251700","7252340"," now, do you see it?"
"7253420","7261100"," So Uh, we have those in place because, uh, as time passes All of this stuff can be made for"

"7287360","7293660"," complicated as time passes Uh, so there's even some of that in the in the background So if you're"
"7293660","7301060"," wondering why or if I have shown my trades I have Uh, I've shown them publicly In the past now."
"7301260","7306700"," I'm not going to continue to show them anytime Someone in a chat asks for me to show them I"

"7482080","7484300"," There's no need to I don't need the money. "
"7484540","7491160"," So, um If I do I will We will we're gonna for the I know the data is expensive."
"7491560","7501920"," So that's gonna cost us a bunch of my I can't pay for everything for free forever Sorry,"
"7502060","7502900"," we'll move on from this."
"7502960","7503160"," We're done. "
"7503560","7504020"," We're we're done."
"7504140","7508160"," We're moving on something else We're gonna start talking about j-pow here in a little bit We have"
"7508160","7514680"," to get through j-pow and uh what he said and what he means and uh, so my takeaway we'll"
"7514680","7522540"," start with this baseline my takeaway from j-pow is uh as we had as we headed into um as"
"7522540","7532520"," we headed into um Jackson's hole There's a needle that he has to thread"
"7533540","7540400"," and the needle that he has to thread is If he can and as long as the market believes him"
"7541090","7545700"," He has to threaten unless he's in a rate decision meeting."
"7545960","7552240"," So if he's in a rate decision meeting those meetings matter Uh, they meet they matter of two for"
"7552240","7561020"," historical uh reference so the reason why The reason why the press release matters is because those"
"7561020","7570720"," are the actual things That are checked in two three ten twenty years They don't care what was said"
"7572330","7578660"," Per se in in those rate decision meetings They always want to reference check. "
"7578680","7583660"," So for historical fact What did he say in his press release?"
"7584300","7584940"," Does that make sense?"
"7585580","7591160"," So if you're going to go back in 10 years and say hey, let's uh do a forensic analysis of"
"7591160","7599780"," uh, what Jerome Powell's Fed did after covid they're not going to go into his speeches"
"7599780","7609380"," and uh, and dissect everything said by a response to a reporter They're going to actually go into"
"7609380","7619200"," the press release as the official Presser from Jerome Powell Now he can repeat"
"7619200","7626060"," that Presser where what's submitted in his presser, but then he starts to talk right And he has"
"7626060","7636040"," some some leeway to what he wants to say and uh, it's important because uh, it's important to to to"
"7636040","7645180"," note what context is in uh, what's prepared and what's spoken about in the context of that event"
"7646280","7655820"," now Jackson's whole is not a place where uh, there was an emergency rate meeting decision or We"
"7655820","7664720"," would expect Higher or lower rates to be announced at Uh, and the conversation that he had he had a"
"7664720","7673440"," little bit more freedom in that meeting uh to threats it and It's not a rate decision meeting."
"7673440","7674080"," Do you get it?"
"7674360","7675600"," So do you understand here?"
"7676500","7681960"," There was no threats Inside of his last rate decision meeting in 10 minutes time now at the top of"
"7681960","7686920"," the hour Do you have a couple of uh fixed income auctions from the u.s To the usling of"
"7686920","7691940"," 46 billion dollars in five-year notes over the private cover of two to 60 and the prior high yield"

"7810080","7815380"," staying on that topic The there's a disagreement out there."
"7815500","7824740"," So last week When we switched over from Jerome's speech I briefly put on CNBC And there was a guy"
"7824740","7831760"," being interviewed By the host from CNBC and he said That was the most hawkish fed we've seen in"
"7831760","7838080"," some time It was super hawkish That guy that was being interviewed likely had a short position on"
"7838080","7844140"," the market Or likely trying to push a narrative for his belief that the market is going down And"
"7844140","7849860"," the moment that that guy They like exited that interview with that guy And they went to one of the"
"7849860","7857360"," hosts and the host said that wasn't a hawkish fed And he let that slip Now the reason he let"
"7857360","7861200"," that slip was because It wasn't intentional. "
"7861840","7870060"," He's not supposed to tell you those things on CNBC That that was a dovish fed and As it relates"
"7870060","7878560"," to you in the stock market What you need Jerome to do Is to Make the market believe that we're"
"7878560","7883480"," going Longer for hire Now there's a guy from jpm."
"7883720","7890400"," I forget his name I think his name is kevin something or other And he came out and said Don't"
"7890400","7896820"," expect rate hikes in september or even possibly november Even if we get them we're going to discuss"
"7896820","7897400"," that in a minute."
"7897420","7903720"," It's a different separate subject The true subject here is That Jerome Powell is walking a tight"
"7903720","7904440"," rope right now. "
"7904460","7912900"," They get that squeezing going right there 443s trading 30 3 cents right now they were 18 or 16 just"
"7912900","7922540"," a moment ago so Jerome Powell right is coming into this Into this jackson's hole and"
"7923380","7932200"," He asked you the longer he can make up the market believe Uh that we're going to hold rates or"
"7932200","7939900"," send them higher The longer the market will continue to go up Now listen to that statement."
"7939920","7941700"," You don't believe that statement."
"7942000","7948100"," I know it I go on fin to it and I see 70% of bears Thinking that kiwi means"
"7948100","7955700"," we go up because she you're not and And and but they don't talk about the original down right and"
"7955700","7962520"," then you've got 70% of bulls thinking that um If we get kiwi the market goes up And the"
"7962520","7968640"," reality is kiwi is usually coming into the market as we're hitting a bottom after a bloodbath Now"
"7968640","7978400"," and another reality here is once rates stop going up and we come into a pause Uh, there's"
"7978400","7981000"," usually a front running of a major role marketplace. "
"7981300","7987640"," These are statements based in the US is in 46 billion dollars Not what I think Prime is fast due"
"7987640","7988780"," to 60 prior."
"7989020","7990220"," Not some fucking shit."
"7990760","7995860"," I'm calling out of my ass Also the US is selling 69 billion dollars in three month bills Are the"
"7995860","8000620"," prime high yield was five spot three percent with the private cover of two to 96. "
"8000700","8007700"," We're going to wait here Keep on squeezing baby Keep on squeezing So right up in here."
"8007860","8011440"," I want you to notice that you're going to we're going to retest down here in this one minute at"
"8011440","8016920"," some point nice and bullish Right, this should pull back and test that that one minute So if you're"
"8016920","8021500"," waiting to get in on this You're just waiting for this roll back here and just to just this nice"
"8021500","8029600"," touch On this white line right here squeezing up right now trying to trade 442.54 So we're going to"
"8029600","8039300"," bring this over so you can see it all So no matter where Jerome is right right now forget about"
"8039300","8049020"," rate hikes for right now For right now Jerome has to sound What"
"8049020","8053820"," some people would call Hawkish But it's not hawkish."
"8054060","8054460"," It's bullish. "
"8054780","8062900"," It's fucking dovish So you're going to get some people publicly telling you that was hawkish When"
"8062900","8071220"," what that person should have told you was uh, that was dovish I know that sounds like an oxymoron"
"8071220","8076480"," in often in trading here They're coming up first about six percent and I stuck up around people six"
"8076480","8081540"," percent as well And the the longer that he makes you believe for the mark the greater market"
"8081540","8085000"," believe That we're not doing good done going up."
"8085340","8093500"," They can't roll the market down Okay, they can't If as long as he's telling the market That we're"
"8093500","8094620"," going higher for longer."
"8095120","8097920"," I assure you This market's not going down. "
"8098120","8104740"," I can assure you 100 percent And when they begin to try to front run that pause In qe that"
"8104740","8110020"," eventual cutting of rates You're going to get your major market role."
"8110240","8115060"," I'm sure you just like a month or two before that happens You're going to see this market roll over"
"8115060","8124720"," and typically that market role is on a high Not on a low And it typically doesn't happen Uh"
"8125700","8129180"," Failing to make a new high It's if it doesn't happen there either."
"8129260","8133300"," As a matter of fact, I did a video Let's find out when I did that video. "
"8133300","8134140"," Hold on a second here."
"8134740","8142120"," I did a video Uh on the original role on 456 Where I said you're going to see this stuff"
"8142120","8147000"," happen or do for a correction And I made it you can why go back and watch the whole video."
"8147000","8154440"," I think it's three more three hours long Um, but we typically don't roll over that 443 is trading"
"8154440","8156380"," 44 cents right now. "
"8156920","8168020"," So So Look at me ma it's squeeze an eye right now so Let's"
"8168020","8175920"," take a look at uh Let me switch that over for you What do we got going on up here,"
"8175940","8176300"," right?"
"8178180","8179080"," Squeeze an eye right now."
"8179120","8180700"," Let's see if we get a half hour candle here."
"8181160","8189960"," It's 1258 Shocker So here's your half hour candle closing itself all right now All right, nice big"
"8189960","8197059"," green half hour candle bowls taken over look for a low in the next half hour candle To go higher"
"8198059","8207230"," 10 that's one candle right there So Oh, let's see it. "
"8207270","8207610"," Let's see."
"8207750","8212250"," I'm like messing up here We'll leave we'll leave this one up down below here."
"8212610","8219670"," So It's your own pal right If he were to come off as if he were to come off and"
"8219670","8225090"," really expect For the five year note auction and three month bill auctions As for the pre-sale when"
"8225090","8228950"," issued yield for the five year note So we'll come out at the top of the hour of the auction. "
"8229190","8233770"," Oh, I'm just gonna squeeze the fuck out of it There's gonna keep going It's even funnier."
"8234309","8244889"," So So So So let's let's go back here to the let's go back here to the Jackson's"
"8244889","8245070"," hole."
"8245469","8251790"," So if Jerome had come out in Jackson's hole and said to you Uh, we're gonna pause through the fall"
"8251790","8257809"," and winter and we're likely going to start cutting rates in spring and summer Uh, that would be"
"8257809","8260570"," believe it or not hawkish. "
"8261330","8267150"," I know that sounds crazy to you I noticed some of you out there hearing that sounds crazy You would"
"8267150","8273809"," expect a role based on that information And you're going to expect that role when you hear that"
"8273809","8278490"," from him When you hear something from him in the future, not even like oh, we're going to pass on"
"8278490","8281150"," a rate increase We're still going higher for longer."
"8281450","8288309"," But the moment that you hear from him say something Dubbish Like uh, we expect great cuts soon And"
"8288309","8293250"," we got some kiwi coming down the pike even farther on the road History missponsored by tics, right?"
"8293389","8300490"," By the way, I'm not sponsored by these guys They've contacted me as well Uh, and I've never reached"
"8300490","8302150"," I've never responded to those people either."
"8302150","8308549"," This is um, financial juice Never ever I've reached out to those people and taken a sponsorship"
"8308549","8314150"," from them I should do like advertise with financial juice every day every month bill auction will"
"8314150","8318930"," probably be released first However, I will lead with the five-year note auction results Dude,"
"8319070","8320910"," there's it's like it's a whole book full of shit. "
"8321150","8331030"," So, um so On on the top going back to the top of of jackson's hole Uh, the reason why"
"8331030","8337270"," that guy slipped from cmbc is because that fucking guy knows that fucking host or that that uh,"
"8337469","8344870"," that guy on the chair Uh, whatever they call those guys So the cmbc host they know that the moment"
"8344870","8351209"," that that happens Uh, what happens to the market if that if that like if it slips If it's um,"
"8351309","8356790"," somebody knows about it Uh, like somebody's like I already already know what your room's gonna say"
"8356790","8364070"," They got a front run showing this market when that happens Now the question also becomes well, are"
"8364070","8365709"," they actually done raising rates cap?"
"8366090","8372150"," Uh, I hope that they're not I want them to get above the rate of inflation Uh for a period"
"8372150","8375070"," of time Uh, they need to be now."
"8375190","8376570"," Do I think that's going to work?"
"8377090","8382790"," Uh, I don't believe so I think the wage inflation The question about wage inflation is only going"
"8382790","8389210"," to grow worse Uh, I don't think it works and I and they have a timeline their timeline is this"
"8389210","8395110"," presidential election Two to three and if you don't think for a minute that That's going to impact"
"8395110","8400050"," Uh, and the fence stance on what we're doing you're out of your mind every president That's a"
"8400050","8405090"," little bit of a billion dollars in five-year notes awarding 32 spot for six or three percent of"
"8405090","8409550"," bids at higher And if I'm getting that if you think that eight three percent in this five-year note"
"8409550","8417490"," cell Directs taking 18 spot to five percent in direct 67 spots nine two percent Now for the three "
"8417490","8422470","-year note cell Us sold 74 billion dollars in three-month bills high rates of five spot three four"
"8422470","8428390"," percent awarding 74 spot four nine percent of the bits at high In the uh, bits cover ratio for the"
"8428390","8437230"," three-month bill are three to four So the us five-year notes drawing at four spot four percent"
"8437230","8447350"," close to the four spot three nine nine percent pre-sale when issued yield So"
"8447350","8453590"," I want to get above the rate of inflation and Stay above the rate of inflation for a period of"
"8453590","8453830"," time."
"8453970","8460230"," I want to say it would be Probably it like in my best world would be about three years two"
"8460230","8464290"," three years somewhere in there Do I think that we're going to do that?"
"8464510","8468490"," No, I think that the time is against us with this presidential election. "
"8468810","8475470"," I think that Greed kicks in like that whole like we're going to do um We're going to do like"
"8475470","8483630"," the 50s 60s and 70s Into 1978 has proven to be inaccurate They bought the dip on the forward pe"
"8483630","8490490"," ratio So you know, they're lying to you even if not what quite lying but making promises that"
"8490490","8495790"," they're going to do something And then they don't follow through on those promises and you have the"
"8495790","8500410"," uh political Aspect to this that will overrun these people."
"8500410","8507670"," I guess unless It could work If the right person or people were elected to positions of a of power"
"8507670","8512770"," that didn't want all the money and greed from the stock market I just don't believe that those"
"8512770","8518670"," people exist anymore Uh, if you think that they do if you think that the they're gonna they're"
"8518670","8526950"," gonna then become Uh, or at some point now they're that politicians are going to Look to save all"
"8526950","8527250"," of you."
"8527370","8528330"," I think you're out of your mind. "
"8528670","8537230"," Pea race the four pea ratio spells that out Quite clear to me Uh that they didn't if that was"
"8537230","8542630"," the case when we were down at the 12 and 14 On the four pea ratio."
"8542830","8546570"," We would have let it roll down and they didn't and there were people saying that they were going"
"8546570","8551730"," that We were going to and those fucking guys all bought they just lied to you They just wanted to"
"8551730","8556970"," buy the dip On the four pe and then have you chase and buy a top That's what they wanted"
"8556970","8561490"," to do And they're not going to tell you when they're selling out or into you as we go higher"
"8561490","8565170"," They're not going to tell you any of this stuff every once in a while you'll get someone be honest"
"8565170","8567290"," with you But it's it's very rare."
"8567530","8573570"," It's not uh, it's not that common And on that on that cnbc interview the other day What was"
"8573570","8582290"," fascinating about it was that that that host was briefly honest He was giving an honest summation"
"8582290","8590170"," of what the what the actual speech was and it was davish It was not hawkish and if you ever"
"8590170","8599370"," hear Jerome powell speak about what you think is davish Uh, you are going to be greatly mistaken"
"8600070","8605810"," You're going to probably go on a social media and make a video and say Jerome powell was really"
"8606730","8611530"," davish today And then you're going to see the market room burn and you're going to come back or"
"8611530","8614750"," disappear And say something like oh shit. "
"8615050","8615730"," Why are they selling?"
"8616350","8622910"," All of this davishness and there's a reason for it Historically, that's what we do Like that's what"
"8622910","8629830"," we do man And then once they finally switch down into qe we're normally at a major bottom When that"
"8629830","8639890"," happens not at the top or usually at the bottom when that happens Uh, no,"
"8639970","8645750"," it's not davish so that the actual davishness so think about this like a curve Squeezing up into"
"8645750","8651530"," the daily trigger once again if you took this trade down here This is a place to take the money"
"8651530","8657210"," and run Uh, even if we squeeze up and above to trade this R2 we should trade the R2 we"
"8657210","8662270"," should trade a four 44 23 But even if we trade that it's dangerous up here."
"8662790","8666850"," So I want to show you this real quick So right up here."
"8666870","8667690"," Here's the daily trigger. "
"8667890","8673010"," I don't know why this keeps uh, or I guess we'll move that over So if we begin to squeeze"
"8673010","8679410"," up and over the first place you're looking for target to the upside is 4 44 23 4 44 59"
"8679410","8685750"," and then of course up to R2 at 4 45 0 5 Uh, you're then going to expect some kind"
"8685750","8692290"," of a roll And then we're gonna try to head higher on Tuesday, maybe And try to take out that"
"8692290","8698230"," big warning sign up above Get rid of some of this stuff here Because your next target up here is"
"8698230","8706070"," going to be Right Let's show this over here Your next warning track is up above here at 4 47"
"8706070","8714090"," 70 You know what else is funny too is if we're trading above 4 56, right Uh, what are you"
"8714090","8721450"," what are you gonna have to say then probably nothing Probably nothing right we were crashing two"
"8721450","8722150"," weeks ago, right?"
"8722310","8723390"," I remember all this shit."
"8723610","8724170"," All right."
"8724290","8734230"," I remember we were crashing two weeks ago Yeah Yeah, so All right, you do make a"
"8734230","8740870"," good point turkey mug it There's like there's like the start So if you've got like we we did this"
"8740870","8742510"," big thing over here last week, right?"
"8742770","8753210"," You've got If this is zero and this is 10 Right as we get more Dovish"
"8753210","8761650"," should be a should be a big old The bottom here in the market too, right max dovishness Right and"
"8761650","8767330"," we're heading into that We were heading into that from the last rate decision, right?"
"8767930","8773710"," And he came out and we're like, yeah, he's slightly dovish there and then we get into this meeting"
"8773710","8779590"," with uh Jackson's hole and he dials it back over here, right?"
"8779590","8785870"," And why is he dialing it back is dialing it back over here with threats?"
"8786910","8791750"," Because the the more dovish we become over here should be the market rolling down. "
"8792110","8792710"," Does that make sense?"
"8793530","8797750"," Rolling down to a major low Right, we don't want max."
"8798230","8803430"," We don't want him coming out over here And we don't want him coming over here and saying we've got"
"8803430","8807170"," an emergency rate hike of 1% today That's like not good, right?"
"8807610","8815090"," Like like keeping that dial pinned over here Keeping that dial kind of pinned right here stops the"
"8815090","8816110"," market roll."
"8816410","8823790"," Does that make sense to like buying time Jerome Powell is buying time in the market I don't know if"
"8823790","8829650"," you like that or hate that or whatever that is Whatever your your anger is however you get angry"
"8829650","8833550"," about that kind of stuff Uh that's not happening for you. "
"8833630","8838450"," I apologize And uh, I know that you thought it was going to happen on a failure to get a"
"8838450","8844470"," new high I think I told you before to expect volatility as we go higher open AI and this usual"
"8844470","8849170"," characters to come out Uh, we're not done going up yet."
"8849410","8855590"," So Uh, if we're gonna be if we're gonna be done going up You are looking for um, let me"
"8855590","8868000"," take a look here and see exactly what you're looking for here If"
"8868000","8890340"," you're looking for that, yeah, we're gonna crash a trade, I guess hold on one second here We"
"8893580","8901720"," just take a peek Yeah, you're looking for like a break today You'd be looking for a break of 425"
"8901720","8908440"," 98 And then you'd look for a rejection trade after that that would take like usually one to three"
"8908440","8908720"," weeks."
"8908720","8916120"," Maybe even longer Uh like 425 98 would be today And you'd want like a huge rejection there. "
"8916260","8921120"," This is like every fucking other time in the history of the stock market Um, you'd want like a"
"8921120","8928020"," failure here and then below 425 close before below 425 and then uh a failure to get back above it"
"8928020","8933100"," again And then you could say yeah, that was the top Uh, you could like say hey, that was the"
"8933100","8937620"," top 456 was the last high we have bad We're now going to roll the market down."
"8937860","8944000"," So you've got people even claiming that shit on social media And that that's bizarre to me as well"
"8944560","8945920"," Uh, I guess they claim it."
"8946020","8950680"," What do they do claim it every 12 times and then we get one roll, but not the roll over"
"8951120","8952800"," And then they say to you well I wrapped it up. "
"8952920","8958020"," I took my money and ran And then when we get a new high they come back and say that"
"8958020","8962700"," wasn't the one but it's going to happen between now and fall We're coming into the week season In"
"8962700","8966640"," fall and we are coming into lay winter week season."
"8967000","8974790"," We know that we get a low in the spring So I know I'll be somewhat right And right now"
"8974790","8982410"," we're trading 443 so Um, not too far from our last high right now, right?"
"8982810","8983110"," What are we trading?"
"8983390","8992470"," 443 Not too far from our last time So so far Um, not not I guess that's making people angry"
"8992470","8999950"," or something maybe maybe that's why tony's angry Hopefully you took the money and ran off that"
"8999950","9009800"," hourly trigger We'll look to see if we can catch a squeeze higher We want a quick second"

"10292140","10299160"," at specific times Uh, which wasn't convenient to what I was trading And then oftentimes a lot of"
"10299160","10306380"," live streams that I found audio streams didn't matter what it was Were archaic or arcane, maybe Um,"
"10307100","10312880"," would be a better way to describe it Uh There's some other ways to describe how they are but where"
"10312880","10317320"," it's where you don't understand what they're talking about Or it's an introduction to a thesis or a"
"10317320","10320100"," concept Uh, and they wouldn't give you a take on it. "

"10546100","10548080"," you people and that's the truth."
"10548480","10556540"," So I would have I would have monetized this at this point As a matter of fact, uh, we haven't"
"10556540","10561940"," monetized it because it's not right So like I'm though I might well I wanted this to continue on"
"10561940","10567600"," into the future And it's not going to continue on Uh for free."
"10567640","10574940"," We know that Uh, if you can't just the cost Uh, it's you lose people that are quality along the"
"10574940","10582180"," way So it has to like take care of itself and run on its own course now On that same"
"10582180","10587200"," token, uh, if it can't take care of itself, I have to move on at some point, right?"

"10616500","10617240"," entire fucking format."
"10617800","10627740"," It's the point So I would save tons of money I got no offense with anyone"
"10627740","10633680"," living in their mom's basement I'm assuming that if I got a divorce I'd probably be around a friend"

"11015070","11024370"," That's all it gets you We're going to attempt to close that gap next Right, so if you're a bull"
"11026530","11029370"," Even in here you need to be tactful, right?"
"11030790","11034210"," We also know this is bus Friday talked about this on Friday."
"11034650","11035610"," Who's in charge here?"
"11036570","11042470"," We already know who's in charge here, even if it looks like it's going up We know that bull or"
"11042470","11043850"," bears are in charge here, right?"
"11044110","11049630"," Sellers have been in charge Since this weekend here, right?"
"11050010","11055270"," Sold it down, sold it down Sold it down, sold it down, right?"
"11056290","11063310"," Sold it down Sold it down right here And just like that the bears want to sell this, right?"
"11064010","11069530"," We know that they want to sell that They want to sell that daily trigger get a big reversal to"
"11069530","11077360"," the downside bloodbath it down and tag Tag that weekly right down here, right?"
"11078240","11084880"," We already know that bears want this reversal here We want it just like they did here, right?"
"11085460","11089740"," Get that last little blast down Get it nice low in the week. "
"11089760","11095260"," It's 4.28 And then you can have your shit back and do whatever it needs to do fail over"
"11095260","11102300"," here and we'll run it back down And not only is it not a correction in here But you that"
"11102300","11104480"," was the actual top above, right?"
"11105040","11111740"," It's going to blast back down hold it underneath start hadn't even lower hit that 420 And see a"
"11111740","11112580"," bull's were out of here."
"11112860","11117580"," So If you're bullish on AMD, what do you need to happen?"
"11119060","11124720"," Right What do you need to happen in here if you're bullish in AMD is not going to go up"
"11124720","11127100"," without the market going up, right?"
"11127740","11132980"," So if we're trading right here right now, are you buying AMD here likely not?"
"11134220","11140280"," You I would pause it that you would want to see the market above 4.43 For you to take"
"11140280","11146920"," a long in AMD I would almost suspect That you would see AMD we're going to switch over to it"
"11146920","11156680"," right now So an AMD here is this the place to buy a dip on AMD Probably not"
"11156680","11166220"," you're probably looking for price to get above And hold Above"
"11166220","11173680"," 103.09 and not only that you're looking for the squeeze higher and the confirmation with hourly"
"11173680","11178140"," trigger To even enter that trade right there You know what i'm saying?"
"11178540","11185780"," So 104 flat maybe and even if you're bullish there You should be checking the market to see if it's"
"11185780","11189060"," bullish And your trade is only good until what?"
"11189800","11197580"," About 108 somewhere in there between today and tomorrow right about 108 You're going to look for"
"11197580","11202460"," the sell back down and then that hourly to come back up Push you and grind you higher."
"11202700","11203860"," So how do you begin to get bullish?"
"11204500","11213180"," Above this 108 you're actually looking for price your second trade for AMD Is that squeeze higher"
"11213180","11220020"," right rejects down comes back up and starts to grind And get the hour the price above hourly and"
"11220020","11226220"," daily So you can then go back and get super bullish And say you know what we're going to come"
"11226220","11234160"," back and we're actually going to trade this 124 43 And this 132 22 so you've got some work ahead"
"11234160","11242440"," of you On AMD before you can get bullish right 104 is going to be key 108 is going to"
"11242440","11252260"," be key To attack 124 38 and then of course previous high of 132 Now if there's a rejection"
"11252260","11261920"," here If there's a rejection here at any point In this attempt to go higher Like a major rejection"
"11261920","11270420"," we start doing this We will trade $90 So it makes sense too And we'll actually trade even lower"
"11270420","11277420"," lows than that 74 51s on the table and then by springtime I think it's 30 I think it's 60"
"11277420","11282760"," and then 34 or something like that is like the real death and destruction If this is the market top"
"11282760","11290360"," here Uh, this is what you're looking for right Is is for these continued rejections here So if"
"11290360","11295920"," you're even if you're a bull you've got no bullish thesis until All this work is done. "
"11296160","11301660"," This is the same as when we're bullish and we become bearish You say to bears you have to do"
"11301660","11305580"," this first, right You have to take it down to the daily then you have to take it down to"
"11305580","11309580"," the weekly Then you have to close underneath the weekly then when we start looking for those new"
"11309580","11319460"," lows I can tie in for a second Yeah,"
"11319460","11320680"," roblox was the other one, right?"
"11320820","11321820"," We'll do roblox real quick."

"14313540","14322000"," was a 73 uh flat or 73 flat Uh with a possible extension of uh 73 37 didn't quite get"
"14322000","14330240"," the 773 37 Uh, but still looking for that target to the upside 73 37 And then uh, the second"
"14330240","14340120"," target after that is 74 55 and 7501 So if you are a gas or oil bull If you're still"
"14340120","14341580"," in that trade, I am as well. "
"14341820","14348700"," I'm not getting out of that trade at this point I'm waiting until uh, it trades 75 bucks So I'd"
"14348700","14354240"," like to see like 74 and change or 75 flat minimum As for if it goes up to 100 bucks,"
"14354240","14360520"," uh, we'll have to revisit that Uh, if it does go up there or not There's that previous high that"
"14360520","14370200"," I think gets Some volatility that previous high above $74.42 a barrel that's down six cents or zero"
"14370200","14378500"," spot zero seven percent So if you're still in that trade congratulations, it's a great trade um"
"14380480","14381600"," We'll we'll revisit it."
"14381760","14387540"," I think we sell that 75 and change and then we come back down and uh We trade like 71"
"14387540","14394220"," again or something like that 71 bucks or something like that Maybe there'll be another uh, maybe 72"

"14510640","14515920"," To clean I try to clean up this kind of crap in here Uh, but it was basically a line"
"14515920","14522480"," going to wednesday to here to the deli trigger Uh, then some downside, uh, then the continuation up"
"14522480","14528700"," in a friday in a 450 or something like that So we're going to talk about that Um, so currently"
"14528700","14536600"," right now what i'm looking for this is a monday Tuesday, wednesday thursday and friday, um I guess"
"14536600","14542180"," you're going to have bears tell you that it's just window dressing or something Um We know this is"
"14542180","14544120"," where the daily trigger is right here on spy."
"14544400","14550560"," We know we need to get above it We don't have a choice Uh, but to get above this for"
"14550560","14556000"," any kind of continued bullishness So right here we need to get above this daily trigger."
"14556200","14562540"," No bullishness unless above and not only that Uh, you need to get above it and consolidate on our"
"14562540","14567740"," le trigger You need our le trigger above the daily trigger to begin to break through this stuff"
"14568760","14576640"," Smash above Our three at 448 and take out that 450 Um But that is happening. "
"14577000","14583040"," So the hourly trigger keeps heading higher higher Uh, so it's showing its bullishness here."
"14583040","14591740"," So i'm going to expect this hourly trigger to get bought Uh To go higher Uh, into end of week"
"14591740","14599080"," upside target end of week is still 450 Uh, expect that by end of week Also note that the 31st"
"14599080","14605700"," is end of month Uh, I Actually expect even higher than that to be honest with you I think 450"
"14605700","14613080"," is being conservative for bulls Uh, but 450 in 10 a month seems reasonable now."
"14613340","14616220"," What's funny about that is uh, 450 is what?"
"14616740","14624580"," 60 points Six dollars lower than the previous high right Pretty bold statement to be making Uh,"
"14624840","14627000"," pretty bold statement to be making here, right?"
"14627460","14633420"," My expectations are that we trade 450 or higher Uh, into Friday and likely higher into the first of"

"14646220","14651880"," that I'm gonna bring this up for you into tomorrow's closed here. "
"14651960","14660420"," So you have this available Saying that If at any points Uh, we break down from this daily trigger"
"14660420","14669400"," and underneath this hourly trigger I'm going to uh, buy a bunch of puts And look to get really low"
"14669400","14678580"," into the 31st So any kind of like rejection candles on a half-hour basis Uh, the weekly trigger is"
"14678580","14684760"," down here Says price target down there It's uh, it's actually higher now."
"14684800","14692500"," It's actually gone higher It's up here And it's at 428 and some change down here into Friday."
"14692780","14699440"," So price target Move all that over if you're a seller Uh, if you are a seller what you're looking"
"14699440","14707840"," for into Friday Remember this you're a bear Getting ahead of yourself You're looking for the trade"
