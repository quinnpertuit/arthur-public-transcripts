"29180","30840"," All right, let's see if this is working."
"37140","38440"," Hey Ryan, can you hear me?"
"42140","43060"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"45760","48060"," Yeah, I've got a good morning. "
"48520","50120"," So I've got some issues this morning."
"50140","56080"," I have had a DMCA takedown notice on my account this morning."
"57980","60480"," Did you guys see that my account was locked on Twitter?"
"61400","63120"," Were you able to even see me this morning?"
"68260","74020"," Yeah, a DMC or something DMCA takedown notice of my accounts this morning. "
"74960","75820"," Not cool."
"77220","78340"," Whoever did that."
"80400","81140"," Beat it. "
"83120","84160"," Yeah, it's really weird."
"84280","88360"," I had a so I'm not going to do I didn't do an intro this morning."
"88880","91440"," I don't know if it was someone messing with me. "
"91900","93700"," Joe Donut said that this could happen to me."
"96760","97940"," So I either."
"98560","101820"," Well, I have a I had a DMCA takedown notice. "
"102060","103100"," I don't know what it was for."
"103580","105460"," So I skipped the intro this morning."
"105940","109100"," It's possible that it was the music I was using that it wasn't anything nefarious. "
"110680","113280"," But it locked me out of all my accounts this morning."
"114660","116520"," Yeah, DMCA or something like that."
"118520","121480"," So we're going to kind of do this more like a."
"122720","124020"," I have to keep the music out. "
"124420","125040"," I don't know."
"125260","126880"," It's weird because the music is licensed."
"128180","132540"," I don't know if it was just a robot on YouTube or because they got me on Twitter too. "
"133960","139520"," Had issues on YouTube this morning had issues on Twitter this morning."
"150520","154300"," Yeah, so I was locked out of my Twitter accounts locked out of my YouTube account this morning."
"154800","155820"," So no intro this morning. "
"155900","157520"," I got to figure out what it was for."
"158020","160560"," I haven't seen any notices inside my email yet."
"160880","162480"," Just like a lockout screens. "
"163180","164060"," That kind of stuff."
"166700","169140"," Yeah, we kind of we traded the exact way we thought right."
"169540","170960"," We slide right off this morning. "
"171540","172840"," We slid down right off the open."
"172840","174880"," We should trade sideways."
"175820","180600"," I do got do why you guys see that we are below resistance at this point. "
"190990","192450"," Yeah, Josh is still pissed."
"197230","197690"," Yeah."
"197790","198310"," Hey, Joe. "
"198910","199830"," I don't know if it's."
"200590","206610"," I don't know if I if someone reported me for the DMCA take down notice or if it was."
"208070","209570"," I don't know why I was taken down. "
"209570","211930"," So no intro this morning."
"212250","215010"," I have to take a look at it and find out exactly what is going on."
"215590","217030"," Look at how I got into trouble. "
"217250","219010"," What what I was using that got me into trouble."
"219430","225970"," I don't know if it was the the open the casino image or if it was the music."
"226370","229750"," The music is weird to because that was a that was a free use. "
"231330","236550"," Or if it was maybe the post that I made on Twitter using the movie."
"237630","240330"," Last time I posted something from apocalypse now."
"241330","242430"," I don't know if it was that. "
"242550","245930"," I don't know exactly how I got DMCA take downs this morning."
"252980","254000"," But I got to find out."
"254840","256339"," Or else they got to do this raw dog. "
"259560","261100"," Now this is important, right?"
"261480","262540"," You guys are looking at this right now."
"262580","264170"," This is not a good sign right here."
"264170","268810"," What was the last time we've seen something like this where we couldn't get above something for"
"268810","271150"," what we always seem to be sitting above some form of. "
"274690","275750"," Support, right?"
"276190","277810"," Right now we're just kind of playing around on."
"279830","280790"," The VWAP."
"282670","287030"," It's kind of odd because I've been watching the options chain this morning and that's not a pretty"
"287030","287810"," site either. "
"293040","299260"," And one of the things that keyed me in is I was looking at the 450 C's expiring today."
"301480","305480"," And even on the bounce up this morning, they were losing value."
"306800","308940"," Everyone is loaded up on puts right now. "
"310400","313500"," Everyone there's put flow out the air is right now."
"320240","321760"," You can't open your hair."
"322120","323980"," Bro, I got locked out of my accounts. "
"328080","329580"," Quinn, they got me, bro."
"330080","332640"," I don't know how they got me."
"332720","335400"," I don't know what it was exactly that locks me out of my accounts yet. "
"339750","346370"," But either someone was salty yesterday or maybe we had a few too many fans or something."
"346370","347770"," We have to make this live stream private."
"348250","353330"," I don't know exactly what we do to fix this, but what I wound up doing this morning was turning"
"353330","357530"," a bunch of shit off and had to reset my Twitter account, my YouTube account. "
"365210","366890"," Lone Wolf's like, don't leave me."
"367350","369930"," You know what else is worried about this too is I'm going to have to."
"370130","377470"," I was just talking about wife today because where I live once or twice a year, we also have"
"377470","379170"," internet downages for like a week. "
"380230","383970"," So I'm going to have to get like a hotspot or something like that just in case the internet ever"
"383970","384370"," goes down."
"385490","390450"," I need like a plan B and a plan C and I'm probably going to need to make an alt"
"390450","390730"," accounts."
"391050","396310"," What I'm going to do, I need to talk to you guys today about something is that there was a"
"396310","403230"," time last year where Quinn was locked out of his accounts and he had a backup account. "
"404190","410670"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a third account, not at Captain's Alpha, not at"
"410670","411930"," Captain James."
"412970","415070"," I was locked out of my Captain James account this morning."
"415550","418550"," I'm not sure if I was locked out of at Captain's Alpha. "
"419610","425470"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a third account with YouTube and Twitter and not"
"425470","428230"," use it, but I'm going to give you guys links to that stuff."
"428730","434990"," Or if I'm ever offline again, you guys just go to the website and I'll post wherever I'm streaming"
"434990","437530"," from or whatever in case I get this."
"437690","443090"," And in case this happens again, I'm assuming that somebody was salty, but it could have been"
"443090","444870"," anything could have been a bot out there. "
"445010","446070"," It might not have been somebody."
"449390","450490"," Yeah, I like Starlink."
"454530","456150"," Yeah, no, no big powder day. "
"456470","459950"," I was getting ahead of, I got locked out a bunch of counts this morning."
"462610","464430"," So we are moving up here to resistance."
"464850","466230"," This is concerning right here. "
"466670","469510"," Seeing something like this is pretty wild for me this morning."
"470650","472610"," We had that nice touch this morning too, didn't we?"
"472850","473910"," Bounced right down to 440."
"474850","476110"," So do you guys remember yesterday?"
"476810","480050"," When I said first stop 440, next stop 428. "
"480950","481910"," We tapped 440."
"482250","482690"," Congratulations."
"483350","484610"," Hopefully you guys took profit. "
"485490","488970"," The video last night, we talked about trading sideways."
"490570","493370"," This does look like a V shaped recovery, right?"
"493850","498010"," So I'm interested to see if we trade above this resistance."
"499250","506710"," If we don't trade above this resistance, the expectation would be just like back in March of 2020. "
"506710","508570"," We're going to resist here."
"508870","510770"," Then we're going to trade sideways for the rest of the day."
"511350","521309"," So let's pay attention to this moment and find out if we're able to actually trade above 446.68."
"521770","528250"," I would warn you at this point that if you are long to let the banks take us over this"
"528250","533850"," point, then pick it back up again, right where we are. "
"533850","538630"," Like I would be getting out and then get back in because there's a fat chance that we trade"
"538630","541930"," sideways from here, that this resistance is real."
"544990","547550"," If we are able to break above it, then we'll take it higher."
"573210","608820"," The next target above would be 447.76. Yeah,"
"608940","618860"," 447.82. We'll take a look right now"
"618860","619620"," at IWM as well. "
"619620","629560"," But there should be a short covering right at"
"629560","629780"," 440."
"630500","632540"," Question is, do we trade higher or not?"
"632620","633880"," Do we smash through this level?"
"634360","635240"," It seems like we are."
"635400","637360"," We didn't get, we didn't get stray rejected here. "
"646060","669250"," Let's bring it back slightly so we can see 446.91."
"670810","677710"," Okay, you're looking to see us break above 446.94, maybe 91."
"690870","700700"," So on your charts, just snap a line at 446.91. We'll look below"
"700700","701880"," just in case here."
"703120","704200"," All the way down to 4,400. "
"705180","705740"," It's weird too."
"705900","710900"," I almost bought calls on that bounce down below and calls are just being grinded up."
"710900","712360"," There's no interest in calls. "
"720720","723540"," And you call your next support 44010."
"734590","737350"," Snap two lines on your charts on the spy daily."
"743290","749910"," And if we break above this 446.91, pick up your calls once more. "
"750410","753470"," Otherwise, treat it like we're inside of a trading zone at this point."
"765200","766480"," Yeah, I missed 442."
"766740","767500"," I tried to buy it 440. "
"768860","771940"," Watch the grinding in the calls and then just stayed out of it myself."
"780780","790140"," Well, so the last night I made a video about the Opexes that took place during the COVID crash."
"790980","794200"," And both were around the monthly Opexes. "
"794580","799400"," We tended to trade a very range bound into that Monday, Tuesday."
"799400","805280"," And the first Opex, we ended up trading up slightly after the Opexes."
"805720","807540"," Then we ended up coming straight down. "
"808220","813940"," And then the next month's Opexes, we came up slightly, traded down, but then we swung higher."
"836400","840060"," So I think that this morning that we're going to trade sideways, it could be wrong on this."
"840740","844120"," There were some calls that came into the market this morning, but it's very light. "
"844820","846860"," We are 49% bearish."
"847960","857700"," We have a 2.45 to 1.42 bearishness to bullishness on the put-to-call"
"857700","858080"," ratio."
"861710","864410"," There are some calls coming into the market though this morning. "
"864850","867650"," There are calls coming into NVIDIA NVDA."
"868070","869770"," There's spy calls coming in."
"871510","874810"," So we can do is we'll see if we can break above this. "
"885950","889990"," 447.74. See if we can look above here and see what's above."
"907890","908410"," 474."
"917130","919370"," For all intents and purposes, we've got more buyers. "
"919730","921870"," We've got a great hero indicator."
"933890","935890"," NVDA has lots of calls on it."
"935890","938330"," January 28th, 255C. "
"939210","965590"," January 28th, 237.5C. January 21st, 242.5C. LVS"
"965590","967590"," is just blasting off here too."
"970160","971160"," They're squeezing."
"983590","985590"," Zillow traded down this morning, right?"
"985790","989810"," 50 bucks had that capitulation move and they just squeezed as well. "
"1000400","1036339"," Hood went down to $12.78. We"
"1036339","1040700"," talked earlier this week about a price target of $196 on IWM."
"1041240","1046579"," We got $197.60. I guess that's a pound of flash, right?"
"1047359","1047840"," An IWM."
"1078300","1085840"," I want to take a look at my next price targets on the rut here. "
"1094490","1100790"," Ultimately, I want to see $189 on the rut, $189."
"1161750","1162770"," Tank tight here."
"1164510","1168470"," I'll give this one more time. "
"1187660","1188120"," $146."
"1200080","1202820"," Yeah, David, we didn't break through resistance above here."
"1205320","1212200"," So we're going to look for either a trading range, right?"
"1212860","1214700"," There's a few points to realize, right?"
"1214860","1224860"," You've got resistance above at 446.63. You've got V-Wops sitting down here at 443.856, right?"
"1225940","1228180"," And then down below 4,400. "
"1231400","1232740"," So we can get this to load up."
"1234280","1236200"," 4,400 is your next support."
"1236940","1238120"," Let's look lower here from here. "
"1240980","1243980"," Seeing a wave of puts come through right now, too."
"1244680","1246460"," Seeing them coming through on Neo."
"1248520","1250540"," February 18th, 25p. "
"1252700","1256320"," If you have twins in here, I seek coin puts."
"1257520","1260320"," January 21, 195p."
"1261420","1262040"," Palantair puts. "
"1263020","1263390"," 13p."
"1264020","1265800"," That's April 14th, 13p."
"1266860","1268380"," PFE, AGO. "
"1270540","1271780"," B-I-T-O."
"1272100","1272980"," Don't know that ticker."
"1273540","1275660"," X-O-P has puts on it. "
"1279780","1281820"," Let's take a look lower and see where the reel next."
"1282080","1283520"," We've got some support down here."
"1284800","1285360"," Hold on here. "
"1286320","1286760"," 435."
"1290400","1299250"," Just saw some spy calls."
"1299250","1301910"," Also Mark 43207. "
"1303570","1304450"," It's interesting."
"1304730","1306990"," I just saw spy puts, right?"
"1307410","1309370"," January 21st, 441p."
"1309850","1311070"," $131,000. "
"1311630","1317490"," And then a set of spy calls for $50,000 at 448c."
"1321480","1322960"," 432, 430."
"1340950","1343490"," And the flow at this point really isn't telling much. "
"1343490","1362310"," Let me scroll"
"1362310","1363170"," back through real quick."
"1368080","1375020"," There was $700,000 taken out on February 18th, 189 on IWM."
"1376360","1378740"," And that is my next price target for IWM. "
"1383480","1393300"," At 1042 Netflix had calls come out for March 18th, 400c, $13.9"
"1393300","1393660"," million."

"1419240","1424060"," And also had a call come out for the queues for February 18th. "
"1424060","1426620"," So these are for February 4th, right?"
"1429560","1432460"," $4.4 million in puts for the queues."
"1433380","1439560"," But then also February 18th, 365c for the queues for $3 million."

"1752690","1757130"," NRG, good one."
"1768040","1772180"," Check out NRG January 20th. "
"1772180","1773160"," Oh, no, scratch that."
"1773720","1775840"," That was January 20th, 2023."
"1776080","1779140"," That's probably just to prop it up to scratch NRG. "
"1781460","1783680"," That's a year out call on 50c."
"1785920","1788120"," That looks like just an exchange for shares."
"1794150","1799210"," Some spy puts just came in January 28th for 440p. "
"1802530","1803250"," $392,000."
"1812960","1815160"," What does all this mean, I guess, is the question, right?"
"1815320","1816980"," Do you guys think we got the Vanirale today?"
"1817480","1818340"," Is that the implication?"
"1827040","1828200"," Let's see what you guys are saying."
"1828220","1828600"," Hold on. "
"1836870","1837370"," Oh, yeah."
"1837590","1840930"," So Quinn, if you guys take a look back on."
"1849840","1850200"," Yeah. "
"1850300","1857480"," So Quinn, if you take a look back in March of 2020, it's a pretty decent example of us trading"
"1857480","1864200"," down during two months of OPEX and what took place over the OPEX period."
"1865940","1872640"," So you can easily just look back on it with a weekly chart or whatever, and you'll see that we"
"1872640","1879460"," traded down that first OPEX into the OPEX date, and then we traded sideways."
"1880700","1887460"," We wound up having a very short Vanirale, and then we continued down in the charts. "
"1888440","1890640"," And then the following month, I'll see."
"1890740","1892160"," I can bring it up, I guess."
"1892820","1893140"," Hold on. "
"1893220","1894200"," I'll show you guys one more time."
"1894620","1895920"," Just in case you guys didn't see it."
"1898380","1899800"," Give me a quick second here. "
"1923220","1924060"," Hang tight here."
"1924060","1924760"," I'll bring it up for you."
"1928920","1930240"," Let's try to figure out. "
"1944130","1945210"," Come on now."
"1963530","1964910"," It should be just a moment."
"1964910","1965910"," Let's do it. "
"2005080","2020370"," Just a second."
"2033430","2034110"," I'm going to load this up."
"2052100","2052739"," Whoa, whoa, whoa. "
"2052900","2053620"," Come right back here."
"2056090","2056489"," Easy."
"2078770","2080510"," I'm just going to bring this up here for you. "
"2080510","2088230"," Okay, so right here, this is when we had the decline in March of 2020."
"2090830","2098070"," What was important to note here was to the first OPEX here, right?"
"2098870","2103750"," And right into this OPEX here, we traded down into the 28th."
"2104450","2109190"," The interesting part about this though is that we had this capitulation move, and we traded"
"2109190","2110490"," sideways through here. "
"2110890","2112210"," This is the 27th."
"2112590","2116170"," This lasted into March 2nd."
"2116750","2118910"," We had a Venerali, but then we traded down again. "
"2119250","2124250"," And you'll notice even this capitulation move here, we had some sideways movement, and we continued"
"2124250","2125050"," down here."
"2125170","2126250"," A nice capitulation move."
"2126830","2129350"," A little bit of a Venerali traded all the way down here as well. "
"2129850","2133330"," But you can see down here, we had on the 20th."
"2135130","2136270"," This is the 20th, right?"
"2136430","2140310"," This was the OPEX of March."
"2140850","2143010"," We had this little bit of a trading sideways, right?"
"2143490","2147110"," And the 20th into the 23rd, some grinding action. "
"2147510","2148250"," Same thing over here."
"2148330","2152190"," We had some grinding action, traded up on a Venerali rally, and then continued down."
"2152550","2157210"," So if you have a bearish perspective, we should trade sideways for a few days, maybe have a"
"2157210","2163290"," Venerali on Monday, Tuesday, and then if you think we're coming down still, we should continue to"
"2163290","2164030"," trade down here. "
"2166450","2172290"," So even if we were to get a Venerali, it probably wouldn't happen technically today."
"2174490","2178550"," Probably be range bound today into Monday, Tuesday at the least."
"2199340","2200700"," Need a dump now?"
"2206550","2208210"," Maybe some of you guys comments out there. "
"2217690","2221250"," Massive positives on product roadmap to move the price of my opinion."
"2229010","2230310"," Reversal was sexy as hell."
"2231010","2232630"," Scroll back up here and see what's going on. "
"2235590","2237950"," Joe Harper, I really want to see Peton rally."
"2245050","2246890"," Yeah, we talked about Peton yesterday."
"2247590","2250230"," That someone will pump it up and pimp it up to get out of their positions. "
"2257680","2259860"," So we bounced up here, right?"
"2260040","2265520"," $4.48, $4.47, $4.46. Do you guys think that we trade above this resistance area here?"
"2266040","2270920"," Or do you guys think we can rearrange bound today between let's call it $4.40 and $4.46?"
"2391730","2392850"," This is for Quinn."
"2397480","2400100"," Yeah, it was nice to see Bitcoin sell down yesterday, right?"
"2400260","2407160"," All these long-only hedge funds have to drain the bank account and pay for hedging at the worst"
"2407160","2408020"," possible place."
"2408020","2413160"," So let this load up over here. "
"2415720","2419320"," Yeah, Peton's back to its original price, hilarious."
"2422870","2424030"," $2,748."
"2428030","2429370"," Almost time to short Peton again. "
"2457060","2459300"," Next price target for Spy."
"2459660","2489280"," We've got $4.47.86. Above that $4.49.54. Quinn,"
"2489380","2493780"," you've got some resistance at $39.183 on Bitcoin."
"2496220","2498420"," We'll let this load up real quick as soon as it's loaded. "
"2498540","2500120"," We'll look above and below so you can see your levels."
"2531630","2533070"," This is loading slow."
"2542430","2545270"," We'll let this load up and we'll look back in the Spy until it gets done. "
"2602790","2604010"," All right, here we go."
"2614750","2620250"," All right, Quinn, so you could get a short squeeze here at $39.250 on Bitcoin."
"2621230","2631150"," You have some support firming up down below here at $38.77.5. If there's a rejection, your"
"2631150","2632370"," next stops you're looking for. "
"2645590","2655450"," You've got light resistance at $37.5.33. Slightly firmer resistance at $37.0.39.5. This is not"
"2655450","2658110"," really big support down here at $36,000."
"2658930","2660550"," Let's look lower and see where the big boys are."
"2668370","2672490"," Next stop, $35,000 on Bitcoin. "
"2673690","2678110"," If Bitcoin does squeeze higher, I don't know if it's going to be a squeeze, but if it trades"
"2678110","2678370"," higher."
"2682470","2685230"," If the market doesn't sell down, let's say this week."
"2699540","2709410"," Next stop, $39.744, $49 "
"2709410","2712050",".29, and then $43. "
"2714230","2715930"," What if there are any bag holders above?"
"2718670","2719790"," Any hard sells?"
"2728470","2734570"," $43,000 in area of interest."
"2767020","2769780"," This is good to see the spy where it's at right now."
"2769920","2772220"," This does look like a recovery rally in here. "
"2772900","2777340"," This is good movement for this time in the morning, 11 a.m. You want to see us move up"
"2777340","2777640"," another."
"2777640","2779660"," I think we moved up already."
"2780380","2781660"," 70 points, right?"
"2781980","2782280"," 70 handles. "
"2782520","2783380"," Yeah, 70 points."
"2784380","2788800"," You want to see this type of recovery at this time in the morning."
"2788800","2790080"," We talked about this yesterday, right?"
"2790740","2793700"," You're looking for a larger move than we saw yesterday. "
"2797650","2807580"," There is resistance above here at 447.36. Probably going to take another"
"2807580","2810080"," long here, so take a look here."
"2832700","2835780"," Let's see if I can grab some longs at some point."
"2850800","2852140"," So I grabbed some 450C. "
"2853140","2854020"," What's going on here?"
"2854880","2855760"," G-D-X."
"2857820","2862900"," Got some resistance above at 449.56. Some in some longs to 450."
"2863640","2865100"," We'll see if we can trade up there. "
"2882610","2884490"," Let's see if we can take a stab at 450."
"2921830","2925290"," Hey, Joe, did you end up cashing out of your puts this morning?"
"2926930","2928090"," Yeah, it's definitely over."
"2928230","2928750"," We're not going up. "
"2932510","2933610"," Just give it up, bears."
"2937610","2939310"," Strong supported zero for Bitcoin."
"2944650","2945650"," Biden's pumping everything. "
"2948270","2949890"," Yeah, I still don't see us going up."
"2950050","2952230"," My view right now is ultra bearish."
"2952490","2953370"," Not ultra bearish. "
"2953370","2962990"," I'm not, you know, we're going to 150 bearish, but I have to look at it from the perspective that"
"2962990","2969990"," I'm trying to look at it from, I guess, is where do I feel comfortable buying tech at?"
"2974150","2975890"," And I don't feel comfortable yet, right?"
"2976050","2981850"," I don't even feel comfortable buying spy until we trade down to the 420s, possibly 400."
"2992390","3001130"," So I do think that I"
"3001130","3004670"," think we continue to trade down."
"3006930","3012650"," I don't know if we trade sideways until the 26th, or if we get this van around heading into next"
"3012650","3019070"," week, then we trade down, let's say, into the Fed meeting on the 26th, because that's Wednesday,"
"3019450","3019570"," right?"
"3022690","3024710"," So today's Friday, we could end up. "
"3028900","3030800"," Let's say we have a van around on Monday."
"3032060","3034380"," We trade down into the Fed meeting in volatility."
"3039310","3041710"," No matter what, you're going to get volatility in the Fed meeting. "
"3070960","3072880"," Watching some spy puts come in."
"3075240","3079540"," January 21, 446 P for $168,000."
"3117350","3121110"," Real money is down below here at 435, 26. "
"3163050","3168430"," Do I think that the market is pricing in worst case scenario from the Fed and anything other than"
"3168430","3168570"," that?"
"3168570","3171330"," Now we're rocking a short-term meeting next week after Fed meeting."
"3174430","3180650"," Yeah, Biden's pumping U.S. manufacturing while the market is betting against X, right?"
"3193070","3196530"," Yeah, there's a lot of Netflix calls coming in this morning."
"3206730","3209050"," I'm not on the Discord chat right now. "
"3216340","3222920"," I'm actually typing in and trying to figure out what happened this morning with my DMCA takedown."
"3232760","3234100"," The Green Day is possible."
"3234760","3239690"," Yeah, so the bank surprise is a few. "
"3239850","3240950"," I mean, we know this stuff, right?"
"3241090","3246470"," We know that the banks are pricing in not three to four rate hikes, but four to seven."
"3248730","3252710"," We know that there is hedging coming in into February 18th in the market."
"3253330","3255050"," So scale out a little bit here. "
"3256070","3262030"," Like, look at your screener and scale out to a month chart and know that there are puts that were"
"3262030","3264350"," taken out this morning and the millions of dollars, right?"
"3265090","3265770"," We're taking a look at this."
"3266510","3267250"," Hold on."
"3275760","3282980"," No matter where we are right now, I want you to realize that this morning, there was $21 million"
"3282980","3285280"," taken out and puts on the market. "
"3288480","3293240"," Now, I don't know what retail traders are doing, but I can tell you that the banks think we're"
"3293240","3293780"," going lower."
"3301340","3303820"," And they placed the $21 million bet on it."
"3313880","3317080"," These bets weren't placed at the Bell at 930. "
"3317280","3319400"," These bets were placed after the Bell."
"3319400","3326480"," And they really think it's going to happen until February 18th."
"3330000","3335280"," Yeah, someone here placed a bet for $7 million for 23 P."
"3336320","3337440"," For 7 million. "
"3337760","3340720"," So no matter where we sit right here, right now at this point."
"3343040","3345680"," Someone bigger than you and I thinks we're going down."
"3345680","3355380"," And also when these, when these bets are placed, the absolute gamma strike on the put side goes"
"3355380","3356500"," down lower, right?"
"3357380","3358940"," So it's 428 puts. "
"3359240","3361140"," Now we've got 423 puts out there."
"3362760","3365840"," I don't see $21 million in calls on the spy."
"3366880","3370880"," I see $4.5 million in short dated calls on the spy. "
"3372420","3378700"," Broken up, right, like $60,000 bucks, $300,000, $100,000."
"3379500","3384460"," I don't see like 10 million on one bet that we're going up on the spy."
"3385200","3395080"," So I don't want to know how you can feel like you're bullish on the spy when all"
"3395080","3396980"," the money is in the short side to 423. "
"3405690","3409130"," Now, there'll be short covering rallies, but those aren't vanarallies."
"3409250","3412190"," They're not as steep as a vanarallie."
"3415710","3421290"," I don't think you're going to see a vanarallie at this point if at end of day, like the opening"
"3421290","3425110"," this morning and then the end of the day, you're going to see massive hedges coming in. "
"3425510","3427930"," You're either going to see them on the call side or the put side."
"3427930","3431810"," And as of this morning, all of the hedging is on the downside."
"3433170","3434070"," None of it's on the upside. "
"3438790","3443050"," So my positive is that we trade sideways from now into Monday."
"3444250","3448690"," If you see any kind of a vanarallie, it should be short-lived."
"3450330","3454030"," Unless there's something we don't know, unless some call hedging comes in. "
"3454030","3458450"," We see $20, $30 million in calls at $480, $500, sure."
"3459210","3461850"," We'll shift gears there, but we're not doing that this morning."
"3463370","3466510"," We've got millions, $20 million in spy puts. "
"3467330","3473030"," We've got 12.6 million in IWM hedge puts."
"3474150","3476690"," QQQ's not as bad, $5.8 million."
"3478570","3480050"," Looks like a gimme, right?"
"3480290","3483390"," Like, okay, we're going to let the ERs come out for big tech. "
"3487670","3489310"," But no one's buying it right now."
"3496210","3501810"," It's almost like they've got, you know, they've got Apple on a plank and they're saying, give us"
"3501810","3503830"," your ER and then we're going to sell the market down."
"3504510","3506550"," I guess that's only going to make a describe it. "
"3510460","3512640"," I'll post this stuff on Twitter right now for you."
"3645120","3649440"," All right, so I just posted IWM and spy hedging activity this morning."
"3650320","3655180"," There is nothing on the long side of significance, nothing in the millions of dollars. "
"3655700","3661640"," And what's particularly troubling is that this hedging is very short-dated, you know, two weeks"
"3661640","3662780"," out, right?"
"3673820","3680860"," We asked this question yesterday, we were talking about, you know, who takes out $6 million in puts"
"3680860","3685360"," on the spy or how many millions was it?"
"3685540","3685800"," Hold on."
"3689460","3698170"," Someone took out $10 million in puts on the spy to $4.23, expiring on February 18th."
"3699050","3700950"," Like, do you think that that's a day-to-day trader doing that?"
"3706440","3713440"," Who's placing a $10 million bet against the spy to $4.23, expiring in two weeks, 18 days?"
"3728430","3729330"," What does that mean?"
"3729550","3735490"," It means if they took a hedge, let's say you saw a bunch of call hedging coming in for like"
"3735490","3737790"," $40 million at this point this morning. "
"3739610","3744130"," And it was dated out for June, or it was dated out for March."
"3744130","3745290"," That'd be one thing."
"3745770","3752570"," We're not even out of our quarterly OPEC cycle, and you've got people placing bets for further"
"3752570","3752830"," downside. "
"3754770","3755950"," That's not normal protection."
"3757070","3760730"," It's not like that's not a hedge fund saying, oh, I got to protect myself for the next two weeks."
"3765550","3767810"," That's some big boy saying, hey, we're going down. "
"3769330","3779300"," If some big boy thought we were going up,"
"3779300","3781820"," he'd placed $10 million expiring in two weeks."
"3783960","3785200"," We've seen that happen, right?"
"3785340","3787180"," We've watched Apple trade like that in the past."
"3787640","3792800"," We've watched SoftBank come inside of our markets and make huge massive bets, but we don't have"
"3792800","3797460"," huge massive bets being placed on our market at this point. "
"3799240","3805440"," So unless we see that today or end of day, that means our call wall comes down when all this"
"3805440","3806820"," delta rolls off today."
"3810120","3812820"," And it means we're loaded to the tits on puts to the downside."
"3828750","3829470"," Oh, really?"
"3831010","3834970"," If a lot of, if a lot of funds do short dated hedging, right?"
"3835690","3838830"," You show me because I watch this shit every single day. "
"3838830","3848330"," And I never, ever see hedge walls that expire in two weeks."
"3848910","3850010"," You show me some of that."
"3851050","3857750"," And I'll believe you because I never, ever see hedge walls put hedges that last for two weeks. "
"3857950","3862110"," I see them for one to three months out, but I never, ever see them for two weeks out."
"3871330","3873290"," And I don't think you just get an okay either."
"3873290","3874770"," I don't think some guy just says to you. "
"3875050","3875970"," Oh, there you go, Jimmy."
"3876890","3880850"," Go throw $10 million down in 428 just in case."
"3882910","3883910"," Date them a week out. "
"3883990","3885910"," And if they burn to the ground, fuck it."
"3885970","3886670"," We lost 10 mill."
"3887570","3888710"," I don't ever see that happen. "
"3889670","3894210"," I see it like, I'll see an inside the money put."
"3897290","3899230"," I'll see complex strategies, right?"
"3899430","3902470"," Where they're buying puts, selling calls, that kind of stuff."
"3904590","3908090"," I'll see a trade where they put some put hedging on while going long. "
"3910930","3912410"," But I don't see this kind of flow."
"3912930","3919750"," It's very unusual to see a major put for $10 million expiring in two weeks."
"3921990","3924650"," There's, there's almost no intrinsic value in that put. "
"3927190","3930570"," That put starts burning the moment they place the bet."
"3931810","3936130"," If they were just looking for protection, why not place a 428 P for."
"3937470","3939590"," I don't know, two, three months out, four months out. "
"3940270","3944110"," If they can afford $10 million, I'm sure they can afford."
"3945370","3947530"," For more than that, just for protection."
"3948210","3952590"," But when you're placing heavy, heavy bets that are expiring in two weeks with no intrinsic value on"
"3952590","3957590"," them for $10 million, they think we're going down. "
"3959950","3961150"," And that is the warning."
"3962510","3964310"," There is no argument against it."
"3964610","3965530"," Now we might trade up. "
"3966150","3967030"," Anything could happen."
"3967830","3975740"," But I warn you right now that this reminds me of previous years we've had major declines."
"3977880","3986350"," So if you're a bull, I would say step out of the way, stand to the side, wait until the"
"3986350","3987090"," dust clears. "
"3995520","3997680"," You know, these aren't the droids you're looking for."
"3997960","3999500"," This is not the bottom you're trying to buy."
"4000260","4001060"," We all know what happens. "
"4001600","4003060"," We see a cascade of calls."
"4003660","4005880"," We see millions of dollars and calls come in."
"4012550","4013670"," And we trade up, right?"
"4013970","4015050"," So we just traded up to 448. "
"4016950","4017590"," From 440."
"4017850","4019770"," It was a nice, nice run right there."
"4020290","4022370"," Is there a reason why we traded back down to 444?"
"4025870","4027810"," I haven't seen that in any recovery rallies. "
"4028410","4030770"," This must be like a new type of recovery rally."
"4039060","4040800"," Yeah, my mind is blown right now."
"4040860","4041660"," You really can't. "
"4041980","4044280"," There is no way to come up with."
"4045040","4045600"," I'm a bull."
"4046580","4049940"," I don't think half of you, some of you know, but I want all of you to know out there,"
"4050060","4050140"," right?"
"4050140","4052400"," That I'm just spies on social media. "
"4053120","4054440"," Because I'm a super bull."
"4055900","4057200"," I always buy the dip."
"4057760","4063410"," A long time confirmed bull here. "
"4065970","4069770"," I'm not reading any of this shit that's telling me I should be getting bullish."
"4070390","4072430"," I don't feel comfortable buying 444."
"4073170","4074210"," I feel comfortable at 428. "
"4076210","4078170"," 400 about that dip all day long."
"4079530","4084570"," We got, I don't even know if I should say this or not."
"4085470","4090570"," I saw some projections last night that were down around 390. "
"4093750","4096569"," Some new targets at 390 last night I was looking at."
"4099290","4101569"," I'm almost scared to tell you guys that right now."
"4104569","4106410"," I think that sounds crazy. "
"4106410","4108170"," Yet it's there."
"4108970","4111069"," And I think it's someone was saying it was."
"4114510","4116770"," We close this week down, right?"
"4116970","4118510"," And then we close the month down. "
"4118670","4121729"," If we end up closing the month of January negative."
"4124609","4126990"," It sets us up for 390."
"4133990","4139109"," And then if we close March negative, we close the quarter negative. "
"4141729","4145689"," That would set us up for a market crash."
"4149620","4151960"," That would set us up for a year long decline."
"4153279","4154960"," Like we did in 2008. "
"4160380","4162200"," So start thinking about that stuff."
"4163200","4165000"," If we close this week negative."
"4166380","4168520"," And we close next week negative, right?"
"4168520","4172140"," And then we lose. "
"4174819","4175439"," February."
"4178120","4181359"," It begins to set us up for a market crash type scenario."
"4184080","4185380"," We're not there yet. "
"4185620","4186479"," But if we get there."
"4188899","4190220"," It could get nasty."
"4198650","4199950"," That's coming from a bull. "
"4201690","4202970"," Pretty nasty, huh?"
"4204330","4215610"," Like there's"
"4215610","4216750"," a bunch of setups here."
"4218970","4222010"," For really severe downside."
"4227230","4230350"," Watching some calls coming in HTA. "
"4231170","4233850"," March 18th, 32.5 C."
"4235130","4236870"," $1.5 million."
"4243100","4245820"," Just had Apple puts come in."
"4245820","4246860"," I mean, let's talk. "
"4247000","4247880"," Let's be bullshit, right?"
"4250380","4257020"," Apple puts February 11th, 165 P for $3.4 million."
"4260120","4266820"," And right next to those Apple puts, I'm seeing February 11th, 165 P."
"4266820","4268800"," $290,000."
"4269080","4274700"," Apple puts January 11th, 165 P, $290,000. "
"4296910","4302300"," NVIDIA puts January 21, 255 P, half million dollars."
"4308720","4311320"," NRZ May 20th."
"4311940","4313720"," This is a $9 strike ticker. "
"4314280","4317420"," Somebody placed $600,000 and puts on it."
"4317920","4318360"," NRZ."
"4320160","4324000"," I don't know what else say to you guys out there. "
"4325200","4326060"," Ready for this one?"
"4326180","4327540"," We spoke about this one last night."
"4327740","4328380"," You ready for this one?"
"4328860","4330040"," You're going to love this one."
"4331320","4333480"," You guys are going to love this because we talked about this on Sunday. "
"4333940","4336020"," We talked about it last night."
"4336780","4338560"," Spotify, S-P-O-T."
"4340840","4344820"," February 4th, $2.8 million in calls, 200 C."
"4344820","4361560"," I wonder if"
"4361560","4365320"," somebody thinks that Spotify is going to have shorts lifted out of it today. "
"4374210","4384090"," Spotify, $2.8 million in calls, expiring February 4th, 200 C, $2 "
"4384090","4384790",".8 million."
"4388440","4390340"," Here's another one that just came in."
"4390340","4400220"," February 4th, IWM, $200 P, $1.2 million puts. "
"4422690","4424950"," I hate to be the person to break bad news."
"4425510","4426550"," I don't want to be that person."
"4427630","4428590"," I don't like being a bear. "
"4429670","4431430"," I want to come on here with you guys every day."
"4431510","4432750"," I want to be like, hey, we're going up."
"4432870","4433170"," We're going up. "
"4433170","4433690"," We're going up."
"4434990","4437930"," I don't know how to relate that to you this morning."
"4440750","4442030"," There's a lot of doom and gloom. "
"4442330","4444010"," Some of you guys remember March of 2020?"
"4445030","4447350"," The put flow that came through was insaneo."
"4451830","4452710"," Absolutely insaneo."
"4452770","4453950"," This looks a lot like it to me. "
"4461600","4463080"," Spotify with the Joe Rogan stuff."
"4466500","4468380"," Apple's not going to the downside in ER."
"4471080","4475010"," Well, that's a good point. "
"4475190","4478270"," So Neil's saying Apple is not going to the downside on ER."
"4478510","4479430"," Let's talk about Apple real quick."
"4479650","4481310"," Joe and I were talking about Apple yesterday. "
"4485440","4487160"," We're trying to figure out Apple, right?"
"4487860","4494340"," So in recent history, Apple was trading at $90 or so."
"4494360","4497960"," Was it $90 or $70 between $70 and $90?"
"4500120","4511580"," They had"
"4511580","4513480"," an E or they had a stock split announcement."
"4517050","4518730"," Four-way stock split, right?"
"4521130","4522390"," Then it traded higher. "
"4522990","4523950"," Then it split four ways."
"4533500","4536800"," Price of Apple is $164, right?"
"4548670","4557230"," So the price of Apple stock currently based upon last year went from $90 to"
"4557230","4565190"," $656 a share."
"4565790","4567410"," Basically, pre-split. "
"4568170","4569210"," This is the most recent split."
"4569650","4575770"," I know that they've split a ton over the years, but just in 2020."
"4575930","4576710"," The 2020 move. "
"4577710","4580590"," Share of Apple is now basically worth $656."
"4580590","4589780"," And so you think to yourself, you say, there's no way Apple's going down."
"4590060","4591040"," It just doesn't go in down. "
"4592960","4597560"," Do I think Apple trades down to like 20, 40, 60 bucks or something, more than likely no?"
"4600300","4603480"," But do I think 90 bucks is easily on the table for Apple?"
"4604260","4604720"," Sure."
"4609980","4614980"," At 90, it's still worth, I mean, still worth $360, right?"
"4616840","4627010"," And I'm"
"4627010","4630430"," not saying that I guarantee we go there, but I'm saying you have to at least be open-minded to"
"4630430","4634130"," the fact that IWM are Apple can trade down without a doubt."
"4647730","4650370"," Watching more puts come in right now, IWM. "
"4652290","4662240"," Million dollars in IWM puts January 31,"
"4663620","4665000"," $194p on IWM."
"4666560","4683280"," Yeah, I"
"4683280","4684820"," think 90 bucks is a stretch too."
"4685000","4686480"," I would want to buy it at 90 dollars. "
"4686640","4688740"," I think everybody would want to buy it at 90 dollars."
"4689440","4695120"," But to say it like in our minds, like we have to, we have to as an investor in a"
"4695120","4695420"," trader."
"4696620","4701640"," Because I think originally Joe and I were saying, there's no way that Apple trades down below 150. "
"4702820","4704220"," I think we both agreed on that."
"4708200","4710920"," But then we started doing the math from just two years ago."
"4710920","4717720"," And just because I feel like it can't trade down to 90 bucks or Joe doesn't feel like it can"
"4717720","4723140"," trade down to 90 bucks, mathematically, it seems very plausible. "
"4724680","4729540"," Most companies give back most of their stocks put at some point, right?"
"4729720","4730000"," Not all."
"4730220","4731040"," And Apple shouldn't."
"4731920","4732440"," They're a great company. "
"4732820","4733600"," They'll still be here forever."
"4743690","4750650"," But to think that they can't trade down to 90 or 100 is not as crazy as it seems on"
"4750650","4751130"," the surface."
"4757830","4761190"," So I don't know that we trade down at 90 bucks, but I think you should have it on the"
"4761190","4761550"," table. "
"4762670","4768330"," I think that you should look at it from a rational point of view and say, yeah, I can see"
"4768330","4769670"," 90 from that point of view."
"4771310","4775010"," Because it's still trading at 360 bucks, which is a lot of money."
"4776270","4782010"," For a stock that was 90 bucks two years ago, that means it's tripled in value. "
"4783610","4791670"," And if inflation kicks, excuse me, if we beat inflation, if we raise rates, then we've overpriced"
"4791670","4792030"," Apple."
"4819470","4822970"," So volatility, we passed volatility a long time ago."
"4823410","4824290"," We're passed volatility. "
"4829030","4830470"," Volatility was at 460."
"4831370","4832610"," We're in Beartown now."
"4833650","4834910"," It's a whole other place. "
"4835590","4836970"," This isn't my home."
"4838410","4839550"," I don't like Beartown."
"4841990","4846190"," Beartown is the place where you reverse everything you do as a bull. "
"4847810","4857070"," You look for opportunities to short until you get to a level that bulls feel comfortable buying."
"4875750","4883170"," Okay, so explain to me how fair value of Apple, when Apple was at 90 bucks two years ago, explain"
"4883170","4884330"," this to me about fair value."
"4884910","4886850"," Apple was 90 bucks two years ago. "
"4891230","4893450"," We split the stock four ways."
"4898310","4901610"," Those four stocks or shares, not stocks."
"4902830","4905690"," Shares are part of a stock, so four shares. "
"4907290","4909670"," One share at 90 bucks was split four ways."
"4909930","4912190"," Not worth 150 bucks, right?"
"4913330","4913850"," 164."
"4940700","4942960"," I think it was at like 70 something. "
"4943540","4944680"," It was at like 70 bucks."
"4945020","4946480"," And then I was in that trade, actually."
"4946480","4948960"," I was in that trade right through ER. "
"4949220","4950060"," I held it in the ER."
"4950440","4952060"," I remember the announcement in the ER."
"4952200","4953600"," I think it was at like 70 bucks or something. "
"4954100","4955280"," Then it traded up to like 90."
"4956900","4959380"," Then it went to like 100 and something and then it split down."
"4959900","4963900"," And then within the first day, I think it was up to like 70 bucks or something crazy or like"
"4963900","4964340"," that week. "
"4966740","4968420"," Once the actual split took place."
"4969460","4971300"," So I'm not saying that we trade down that low."
"4971420","4972880"," I think you have to see a bank. "
"4973620","4974780"," I think price does matter."
"4974780","4977100"," Even after a split on certain companies."
"4978000","4980620"," I don't expect us to trade down lower than like 130. "
"4982120","4984260"," I think 150 is on the table for sure."
"4984960","4986420"," But if we traded down to 90 bucks."
"4987780","4991460"," I wouldn't be sitting here when it happens and say, oh, I didn't see that coming. "
"4993180","4995020"," Because you can definitely see it coming."
"4996900","4998220"," Because Apple's traded up."
"5000320","5003320"," In two years, four times the multiples that it had. "
"5004960","5005880"," In two years."
"5008840","5010480"," And the dollar isn't worth anything."
"5010840","5012920"," So of course it's going to trade up four times as multiples. "
"5013040","5015040"," Well, if the dollar starts getting valuable again."
"5016400","5017700"," Then you have to reprice Apple."
"5042380","5044600"," Yeah, I do like the buyback program in Apple. "
"5045320","5047160"," I'm not bearish at Apple."
"5047200","5048120"," I'm not bearish at anything."
"5051340","5052660"," I'm not bearish in the market. "
"5052920","5058880"," I just think that in someone asked yesterday in this discord, they said, are you bearish?"
"5059460","5061200"," Or do you think we just need better prices?"
"5061400","5062240"," And that's what I think it is."
"5062380","5063300"," I think we need better prices."
"5065380","5070200"," I think you've got free money going out the window for a lot of companies that haven't produced"
"5070200","5070620"," anything. "
"5073300","5077480"," And so that's a real issue for these companies that haven't produced anything."
"5079400","5080500"," We've been told this."
"5081840","5082240"," Right. "
"5082360","5083380"," Free money is going out the window."
"5083980","5086200"," So if you haven't made anything at this point, bye bye."
"5092650","5094470"," We've been told that they're going to fight inflation. "
"5095370","5097850"," So if the value of the dollar moves up."
"5099550","5101510"," Then you have to also reprice companies."
"5109950","5114870"," So my assumption is if you're a bull, you have to short or long puts on every rip. "
"5114870","5119950"," I think it doesn't matter if we have a van or alley."
"5120070","5122710"," I think if you let's say you lose that one trade in a van or alley."
"5124930","5127290"," But you won the other nine selling the rips. "
"5130920","5134980"," You can take that one L and still short that van or alley."
"5135780","5141280"," And take another W instead of being nine for one, you'll now be 10 for one."
"5143420","5147040"," I think it doesn't stop until there's capitulation. "
"5149340","5151160"," I think you're going to see a lot of companies fold."
"5154680","5156360"," Or merge or get bought out."
"5157360","5158520"," And that stuff takes time. "
"5158640","5159660"," I think that takes a year."
"5175370","5177030"," So we have more capitulation, right?"
"5177290","5179030"," We're going to need to have more capitulation."
"5179830","5185050"," In the meantime, you can't as a bull take our buy a bottom until it becomes more reasonable. "
"5186370","5190850"," So I guess in your mind, you have to think to yourself, what is reasonable is for 40 reasonable."
"5199620","5201720"," My assumption is that slightly lower."
"5201820","5203460"," It's probably around 400. "
"5206950","5207870"," Maybe 428."
"5210430","5211710"," But if things get ugly."
"5214550","5216630"," There are targets coming out right now. "
"5216630","5218890"," If we have some ugliness in the next month or two."
"5220230","5222810"," We start having red but start stack in red months."
"5226570","5227850"," And then read a red quarter. "
"5229590","5231570"," And then we stack a second red quarter."
"5233110","5234690"," It's going to get real real ugly."
"5258500","5259540"," 4365 today. "
"5260580","5262420"," I don't know if it gets that deep today."
"5262800","5264940"," There were there is some issues here this morning."
"5264940","5268140"," The issues are specifically the issues. "
"5268160","5269080"," This basically."
"5270360","5274300"," Last week we built up a put wall of 428."
"5277000","5279660"," And then a wall of absolute gamma strike of 428. "
"5280700","5282020"," On the downside for spy."
"5282980","5286680"," And so trading out of 440 seems like we're at the put wall."
"5288820","5290540"," But we have another problem this morning. "
"5290700","5291580"," And that is that."
"5292520","5293580"," See where this is."
"5294940","5295920"," Think tight here. "
"5301710","5303070"," Where did I see those puts."
"5306420","5307380"," This yesterday."
"5308940","5309860"," Yeah, right here. "
"5310580","5313740"," So we saw we saw strikes into yesterday down to 428."
"5313740","5314880"," Now this morning."
"5315640","5317700"," We're seeing strikes down to 423. "
"5320440","5322360"," So you're expanding downward."
"5323580","5324960"," From 428 to 423."
"5326240","5328420"," So yeah, 436 sounds logical. "
"5328720","5329940"," 435 sounds logical."
"5330320","5330900"," It's on the table."
"5334260","5336780"," That we trade down to 436 right now. "
"5336780","5337300"," Like today."
"5338300","5338440"," Monday."
"5339460","5340180"," Wouldn't surprise me. "
"5342000","5345120"," If I saw like 40 million dollars come out in 480 C today."
"5345660","5346680"," I'd tell you we're heading higher."
"5346680","5348300"," I tell you the van around is going to go higher. "
"5351140","5353640"," But we're not seeing that expansion to the to the upside."
"5357990","5360790"," And if anything today just sit the heads up today."
"5361490","5366250"," Is that we have huge call delta rolling off at the end of the day today. "
"5367090","5369190"," So our training range higher should."
"5371270","5371710"," Shrink."
"5394170","5396590"," Also watching more calls on Uber this morning. "
"5396770","5397870"," They were on our list as well."
"5416130","5417630"," Give me like five minutes when I go upstairs."
"5417750","5419130"," I'm going to grab a cup of coffee here. "
"5419390","5420070"," I'll be right back."
"5603340","5604360"," All right, I'm back."
"5608210","5610490"," So Quinn, are you are you reassuring us this morning?"
"5610930","5612970"," Bitcoin is heading a lot lower today. "
"5613390","5615430"," You won't find me buying one of these prices."
"5626630","5629790"," Can't believe the diamond hands on Elsie ID."
"5630050","5630590"," Lucid. "
"5645990","5651730"," And there goes Peton right."
"5652030","5653190"," Tacked out at 28 bucks."
"5654690","5655170"," I love it. "
"5658290","5660790"," I love Peton trading back to 28 dollars."
"5662850","5663470"," Classic."
"5693870","5696690"," I'm reading all the stories that came out about Peloton. "
"5696690","5701530"," And yet it trades back to its price for more close to its price from yesterday."
"5703630","5705230"," Is it time to short again, Joe?"
"5712180","5713860"," That's pretty wild, isn't it, Michael?"
"5719060","5720520"," Peton wants to trade it 10."
"5721140","5723340"," I think I might have to enter a Peton short here. "
"5734010","5735890"," Take a look at Peton and see if you can find anything."
"5743980","5745740"," We talked about Peton last night."
"5746400","5747880"," And how they'll trade it up. "
"5747960","5751220"," They'll run a scam operation to trade Peton back up at the open."
"5752340","5754620"," Is everybody kind of on FM F themselves?"
"5755780","5757900"," What can Peton say at their earnings report?"
"5759920","5761660"," Is it going to become like a nickel scam?"
"5815280","5818500"," I just placed an order for some puts after the ER."
"5819440","5819960"," Sweet. "
"5828130","5830130"," So I grabbed some February 11th."
"5831510","5834550"," 20 P on Peloton."
"5927930","5929130"," Look here. "
"5929990","5932010"," Yeah, February 11th, 20 P."
"5932430","5936310"," I want to see what they can say inside of their earnings report."
"5937950","5939250"," I would pump this stock up."
"5941530","5943490"," So February 11th, 20 P."
"5949070","5950650"," Pump this stock back up. "
"5950770","5951210"," $28."
"5953030","5954270"," Gotta be kidding me."
"5967060","5968520"," It's at $32 yesterday. "
"5976230","5977810"," Swings back up to $28."
"5982950","5983790"," How do you?"
"5985010","5988250"," Who can support Peton at $28?"
"5990150","5994360"," Yeah, what are you guys going to check?"
"5995360","5998540"," If you guys have any tickers right now, let me check some tickers for you out there."
"5998580","6000880"," I'll do LC right now for a run. "
"6001540","6003300"," Post one ticker per person."
"6006950","6007850"," Yeah, Peton."
"6008050","6010710"," I just bought a bunch of puts on Peton, so. "
"6013150","6014410"," I'm not buying it."
"6018950","6019990"," I'm going to look at LC."
"6022970","6024250"," I didn't see who you want. "
"6024890","6026210"," What was that ticker LC?"
"6027010","6027430"," Okay."
"6029210","6030250"," How lending club."
"6039880","6040980"," Let this load up. "
"6045440","6046560"," We scroll back up."
"6046780","6047520"," Okay, okay, easy guys."
"6047720","6047940"," Hold on. "
"6050260","6051220"," I'm going to do LC."
"6054720","6056000"," I'll do IWM."
"6062880","6066840"," Will lending club be impacted by money tightening?"
"6067160","6067540"," That's a question. "
"6092450","6095490"," Let's look down below and lending club down to like 15 bucks."
"6095710","6097110"," I want to see if it does what it did."
"6097870","6099670"," The last time we had a rate increase, right?"
"6101830","6104210"," It went down to like 15, 16 bucks. "
"6119370","6127090"," You buy the dipper at $20.29. Put a tight stop at 1990."
"6129550","6132130"," Next stop down below would be 1559."
"6132930","6133850"," And that seems reasonable. "
"6135130","6139590"," So 1559, 1568, 1573, excuse me."
"6140870","6142570"," 1578 would be your next stop."
"6143030","6144530"," So you could buy here somewhere near here. "
"6145750","6153070"," I'd say start buying at $20, $20.29. And have a tight stop at 1993."
"6159970","6162070"," 22, and I would hold it past 22."
"6164770","6166230"," Probably hold it to $26. "
"6168810","6169630"," Maybe higher."
"6181440","6186900"," Even if you're in localized support here, it wouldn't be surprising to see it come down to $20."
"6188060","6188640"," At least $20. "
"6190000","6190820"," But close to a bottom."
"6191000","6191240"," Not bad."
"6191960","6193220"," Over the life of this stock. "
"6194000","6194340"," Not bad."
"6194440","6196480"," It's survived a previous rate hike."
"6196880","6199200"," So probably have some faith in lending club. "
"6226030","6227910"," Sorry, I'm checking on some trades I have."
"6228910","6234990"," I'll let the rut load up."
"6243860","6246220"," I'm checking on some resistance on the spy right now. "
"6276080","6278060"," Peton up at 12% today."
"6282160","6283360"," I don't know what kind of hopes."
"6301810","6305250"," Brian's saying that SQQ, Q broke 10 day average volume. "
"6307230","6308030"," Hold on here."
"6308190","6309410"," We're going to look at the rut real quick."
"6327080","6328520"," Hero indicator is very negative. "
"6330420","6331400"," More sellers than buyers."
"6333400","6336340"," If you are bullish on RTY."
"6337000","6341680"," A lot of ice up here, right?"
"6341800","6343300"," These are all sellers in this light blue. "
"6345140","6347660"," But if you are bullish, if you think there's going to be a Venerali."
"6357510","6359050"," Some resistance above at 202."
"6362310","6363670"," Not much, but a little bit. "
"6365770","6369850"," 204 or sorry, 203.98 would be your first price target."
"6369850","6380660"," 203.95. Some"
"6380660","6389760"," resistance at 205.30. Again at 206.34. It's like sellers are coming down right now, 9WM."
"6394460","6397000"," Don't like seeing this disappearing above here. "
"6399500","6416400"," 209.48. 209.70. 209.93. Here's"
"6416400","6417740"," where the big boy sellers are right here."
"6417860","6418240"," You see this?"
"6418820","6419800"," On the right hand side here?"
"6422900","6423340"," 212."
"6425140","6427900"," That would be a price target if you are bullish on IWM. "
"6434280","6437800"," Look at the SQQ for Brian, because he's here."
"6439980","6448500"," I remember when I first met Brian, he said to me, I've always got my finger on SQQ, Q."
"6452200","6453760"," Just in case."
"6459810","6461670"," Reminds me of Dr. Strangelove. "
"6485330","6502840"," It's in right on resistance of 40.84. Downbell, you got a market 31.61. More"
"6502840","6507400"," sellers than buyers, slightly positive on call flow."
"6513090","6522010"," 40.56. You're looking for above 42.10. Clear skies above from there."
"6532260","6534100"," Tesla, is that one next?"
"6543560","6546080"," All right, got some more flow coming in right now. "
"6549750","6550590"," Disney."
"6551930","6556790"," July 15th, 140 puts $1 million."
"6561690","6568550"," QQQ puts January 28th, 357 P for $400,000. "
"6585250","6590850"," I like seeing that Disney, those Disney puts being out in July, I like that."
"6591350","6593390"," That looks more like healthy hedging."
"6601830","6603690"," That's what you're going to expect to be seeing, right?"
"6603810","6608830"," You want to see, you want to see like an in the money put call for like six months out,"
"6609110","6615650"," three months out, you know, Disney's got a million dollar puts for 140 July 15th. "
"6617610","6623790"," So when you see spy puts dated two weeks out, that's more concerning than a six month out, 140 P"
"6623790","6624670"," on Disney."
"6665350","6667010"," Spies getting bullish at the moment."
"6668170","6671250"," More buyers than sellers, here are indicators popping up on it. "
"6673270","6674550"," Take a look at the hero indicator."
"6679910","6684110"," It's like buyers stepped in back here at 1235 or so, 1230."
"6704030","6705610"," There's a neat little spot on Tesla. "
"6705610","6716770"," If Tesla, if if spy is looking bullish, might"
"6716770","6718150"," have a little intraday play here."
"6722550","6726410"," So it looks like you have some decent support here at 952 on Tesla."
"6729610","6731610"," Blue skies above to 1000. "
"6732310","6733770"," It's a nice trade right here if it works."
"6735890","6736970"," 40 point trade."
"6739850","6745770"," Of concern is the spot gamma note that there is a lot of call delta rolling off today on Tesla. "
"6746290","6748590"," Do these bulls convert to shares?"
"6750630","6755070"," Is a question is also a question of how this was hedged."
"6756090","6762010"," Was it by shorting Tesla or was it by purchasing shares?"
"6762590","6769250"," Because if they go delta neutral on this trade on Tesla, do they do the dealers and brokers sell"
"6769250","6771090"," their shares into clothes today?"
"6773010","6778110"," Or is it become a wash if the long term in the money call holders convert to shares?"
"6781970","6783530"," Which would stabilize Tesla?"
"6789010","6789610"," Amazon?"
"6807660","6810280"," So I'm wondering how I caught that copyright strike."
"6810280","6812080"," Shut down my social media accounts. "
"6813400","6822840"," I think I might have been the music unless it was something nefarious."
"6825120","6828520"," The music had a free or it was free to use."
"6829320","6836920"," I read the copyright on it, credited it in my description. "
"6837460","6839000"," So I'm going to have to check and see what I did wrong."
"6844960","6846620"," Maybe I'm just going to have to buy some music."
"6859310","6867810"," Watching calls come in on Cucom, February 25, 523,285 C."
"6869190","6874210"," Cucom, February 25, 185 C, half a million dollars in calls. "
"6878510","6888570"," Watching some puts split up across, say, one, two, three, four,"
"6888570","6896010"," $450,000 and puts on C-M-C-S-A, January 28, 50 P."
"6899550","6906790"," Watching more palantare puts come in January 28, 14 P for 50,000 bucks."
"6907430","6910630"," Spy puts coming in $100,000, 443 P."
"6913450","6915890"," Looks like they have bashed right off the top up here."
"6915890","6917030"," Rejected. "
"6938420","6940840"," Like a mosquito to a bug zapper, right?"
"6943460","6949460"," Amazon looking for 29.02. It's below VWAP."
"6951280","6952460"," Negative hero indicator."
"6953320","6954240"," More buyers than sellers. "
"6955580","6962360"," If you are bullish, your price target's 29.75, 29.80. You want to look even higher than that."
"6963700","6968700"," Do we get 3,000?"
"6968780","6969920"," Yeah, we got 3,000 right here."
"6972220","6972660"," If..."
"6974400","6975080"," Hold on here. "
"6979030","6983090"," If Amazon support breaks, if you're bearish, we can take a look there, too."
"7008550","7011350"," 28, 80, 28, 50."
"7020720","7021160"," 2800. "
"7021640","7022400"," It's a long way to fall."
"7023280","7024460"," Some big gaps below."
"7025140","7028120"," Tesla, I think Jason was pointing this out in this court yesterday. "
"7028120","7028940"," Somebody was."
"7033440","7034720"," 2790, 2735."
"7048070","7048710"," WFG. "
"7066040","7067040"," Who are West Fraser?"
"7068120","7068300"," Timber."
"7068640","7069740"," I'm interested in this ticker."
"7112740","7115000"," Price targets 108 to 86. "
"7115440","7117000"," Believe it or not, the screen is not frozen."
"7117060","7118700"," It just doesn't have enough data."
"7119420","7122080"," There isn't that much movement on this ticker. "
"7123220","7124080"," Price targets 108."
"7126280","7127740"," Currently sitting at 89."
"7130760","7133520"," Some sellers hiding above it, 93, 34. "
"7136280","7139060"," Looks like this is general support for it as well."
"7148050","7151470"," Does the sell wall on spy keep creeping lower?"
"7151870","7153110"," Yeah, so the..."
"7153110","7155430"," We've got OPEC's today right on spy."
"7155910","7157810"," We've got a ton of calls out at 480. "
"7158390","7159410"," We've got some out at 470."
"7162190","7169530"," I haven't seen any calls of significance to replace those calls."
"7171410","7172830"," You look at it like a range. "
"7173490","7176270"," You've got this range of implied movement."
"7178410","7182390"," And the range for us on the high side is coming down currently."
"7183310","7185490"," The range on the bottom side is coming down. "
"7186250","7189190"," And we have a bunch of range on the upside coming off today."
"7196410","7198290"," We'll see what you guys are saying here, hang tight."
"7200610","7203430"," Yeah, I don't really trust the SG put wall, by the way. "
"7204230","7206070"," I disagree with the SG put wall."
"7208690","7210950"," I don't think they have up-to-date current information."
"7211970","7218110"," I think they do the best job that they can, but they don't have the most up-to-date information. "
"7220410","7222790"," Tesla, Amazon, CV, and A."
"7228040","7235040"," I use a SPOT gamma for general idea based upon when the information was put out the best"
"7235040","7235940"," information they had."
"7239800","7245560"," But I don't think they can keep up with where everything is, especially right now."
"7245620","7246220"," I don't think they can. "
"7251350","7255730"," And I think it's hard for anybody to say, hey, we're going down or we're going to burn this down."
"7256430","7259010"," Nobody really wants to make a call because it's dangerous, right?"
"7259130","7260490"," If it goes the other way, you can get in trouble."
"7270960","7272340"," 137.90 is support. "
"7274700","7281600"," Solid at 153.92. More sellers than buyers currently."
"7290720","7297040"," Yeah, by the DIP 137.11. Looking for 153.64 on CV and A."
"7305740","7308280"," Worst case scenario for Apple, 90 bucks."
"7309540","7309820"," Easy. "
"7313690","7314370"," CRM."
"7316610","7318090"," You guys are giving me some good tickers."
"7318810","7319470"," Good job. "
"7319990","7321490"," I like seeing good tickers."
"7321710","7322470"," Salesforce, baby."
"7323110","7323950"," Joe Donut's favorite. "
"7329270","7330790"," For once, I don't want to see Tesla."
"7350330","7352250"," You want to want to tell you about Salesforce?"
"7356530","7356910"," 218."
"7373790","7375250"," Flowing around up here by its lonesome. "
"7375250","7376550"," More sellers than buyers."
"7377830","7378470"," Double."
"7379870","7381090"," The sellers. "
"7390070","7390710"," Spotify."
"7391130","7391690"," Yeah, we'll look at Spotify."
"7392450","7395030"," It's a good one to look at because of those calls that came in. "
"7403450","7407450"," Okay, get some more big trades coming in right now."
"7414260","7415960"," Spy million dollars."
"7417580","7420120"," February 2nd, 435 P."
"7421020","7422400"," $600,000. "
"7423140","7426580"," Spy February 2nd, 430 P."
"7427020","7428360"," $400,000."
"7429740","7432500"," QQQ, January 26th."
"7434580","7436360"," $4 million, 355 P."
"7439020","7439800"," CLF. "
"7441580","7443200"," January 20th."
"7444200","7444980"," 15 P."
"7445580","7449120"," 1.4 million dollars."
"7449120","7452240"," Spy January 28th, 430 P."
"7452700","7453220"," $5 million. "
"7455000","7459720"," Palantir January 28th, 13.5 P."
"7459960","7461060"," $73,000."

"7466840","7468240"," $28,000."
"7469780","7472840"," Baba May 20th, 105 P."
"7472980","7474260"," $164,000. "
"7502980","7504480"," This is concerning."
"7504480","7505840"," PayPal was on that list."
"7507820","7508620"," We're not concerned. "
"7508920","7509520"," This is pretty good."
"7509840","7510160"," So PayPal."
"7510500","7511260"," Sorry, I got that wrong. "
"7511480","7518200"," So PayPal just had some puts come out June 17th, 140 P for a half million dollars."
"7518720","7519700"," But that's reasonable."
"7520800","7522340"," That looks like a nice hedge, right?"
"7523100","7524540"," June, not in two weeks. "
"7526160","7528700"," June was on PayPal is on the list of possibly."
"7529560","7530940"," Squeeze into Monday, Tuesday."
"7555300","7560660"," I like this trade. "
"7561960","7563900"," I like this Spotify trade."
"7564060","7566660"," I like the fact that it's on some key support here."
"7567480","7568900"," It's down at 199 bucks. "
"7577850","7580850"," If you wanted to follow all those big calls that were coming out on Spotify."
"7583370","7585870"," It's not the line somewhere around 187."
"7587890","7590330"," 186 maybe snap another line of 190. "
"7591190","7597930"," Snap another line at 195.35. We can break through down here and then follow that."
"7598270","7600570"," That big call that came in."
"7603370","7604570"," Take it to 210. "
"7608200","7609380"," Be a buyer down here."
"7610320","7610720"," Somewhere in here."
"7615940","7616540"," All right. "
"7616540","7617820"," What else you guys got going on here?"
"7622860","7624100"," My P time puts."
"7624320","7626000"," I've got puts on P time."
"7626040","7626440"," Let me take a look. "
"7627760","7630920"," I've got February 11th, 20 P."
"7633260","7635900"," I think that's right after their earnings report."
"7636400","7637720"," There's nothing that they can say."
"7639220","7640380"," That's going to be positive. "
"7646740","7648520"," The spies just floating around."
"7648800","7650460"," Perfect day for condors, right?"
"7650460","7652260"," For some flies."
"7654120","7656120"," Unless we sell down, I guess, into the bell. "
"7660760","7663260"," Range bound today as predicted so far."
"7663840","7664760"," 440 to 448."
"7665900","7669940"," Trading down looks like we'll take a look and see how far we trade down. "
"7677280","7683920"," Look for 440.39. It also looks like it's setting up for 435."
"7684520","7685920"," Someone was commenting about that earlier."
"7693700","7694960"," Sellers are lining up at 444. "
"7696000","7698200"," Probably get some panic into the end of the day, too."
"7712040","7715600"," Not guaranteed, but that would be my expectation."
"7715880","7716260"," That'd be panic. "
"7726800","7728060"," What else you guys are asking?"
"7731990","7732430"," Roblox."
"7732810","7733250"," Hi, Zlu."
"7733450","7733750"," How are you?"
"7736550","7736990"," RBLX. "
"7747220","7747760"," Let's go."
"7754010","7757510"," Did just watch some TQQQ calls come in."
"7757510","7762790"," February 18th, 60C, $265,000. "
"7764790","7766290"," Looks like day trader heaven."
"7788320","7789820"," Who I like Roblox here?"
"7792240","7797140"," The only thing that I don't like about Roblox here is that there's no calls above."
"7798900","7800500"," I would watch Roblox closely. "
"7804980","7806620"," There's two things to know about Roblox here."
"7807640","7808760"," Two important things."
"7810360","7811940"," There's a main support for Roblox. "
"7812880","7817360"," You're going to keep your eyes open for call expansion on it."
"7818300","7824880"," But if you don't see call expansion on Roblox and it breaks below this $70, or if it breaks below"
"7824880","7829100"," $68.96, there's not a lot of support down below."
"7829640","7830480"," It could free fall. "
"7839500","7843300"," But if it doesn't free fall and you see some call flow coming on it, it's a nice area of"
"7843300","7843540"," support."
"7844200","7845420"," I like Roblox here to some extent."
"7845780","7848680"," I like the idea of Roblox in the future already. "
"7849060","7850040"," I'm a fan of Roblox."
"7851340","7859800"," I'm biased to the bullish side on Roblox, but at the same time, if you don't see the calls that"
"7859800","7864320"," come in for it, now this could be a set up to call further."
"7881220","7884420"," Danger would be a break below $60, but send you to $50. "
"7891790","7893110"," That's your main support area."
"7893470","7895070"," Just so you know, just heads up on that."
"7895790","7898710"," If there's a sell the world moment, so you want to be buying at $50. "
"7905810","7907990"," You could just put a standing order in for $50."
"7915660","7917600"," I'll go back up here and see what you guys are saying."
"7920510","7921470"," Hold on here, guys. "
"7926910","7928190"," I'm going to read what you guys are saying."
"7928310","7930030"," You guys are talking so fast that I can't keep up."
"7939410","7942010"," After fair knee jerk, there's still Tina, right?"
"7942010","7944350"," Where do they do with all the money?"
"7945590","7946610"," Buying fucking buns. "
"7947530","7949390"," Building rocks under the mattress devil."
"7954540","7955840"," What do you think on spy?"
"7957200","7959300"," You're sitting at the SG put wall."
"7963640","7967440"," Lots of rumors about Apple to buy pitons since early January. "
"7967900","7968480"," I remember those rumors."
"7970600","7972240"," What do I think the put wall is?"
"7972820","7973540"," It's going down."
"7974840","7979240"," That's why we broke below $4.60. It's going down. "
"7979620","7984560"," Today we have the call wall, unless we see major calls come out today."
"7985240","7989800"," The call wall is now going to come down to $4.65, I would say."
"7990160","7997160"," The absolute gamma strike on the call side will come down to $4.65. $4.70. Maybe not, because"
"7997160","8003880"," someone took out $4.70s and $4.80s. The absolute gamma strike was at $500. "
"8004380","8007040"," The call wall was at $4.80, I think."
"8009600","8016560"," I know right now that our put wall down below has expanded to $4.20, I think."
"8019820","8021540"," It's currently expanding on the downside. "
"8031080","8033600"," Yeah, I bet CDNA looked like a good ticker."
"8033900","8034200"," Touch."
"8035800","8037980"," The UNH looks like money moving in. "
"8038420","8039800"," Okay, we'll take a look at UNH next."
"8041400","8043020"," I always like to hear something like that."
"8043680","8045020"," Looks like money's moving in. "
"8062010","8063170"," We can flip bullish."
"8063350","8064550"," We just have to see the flow come in."
"8064610","8067690"," If we don't see that flow come in, we can't be bullish. "
"8068610","8069750"," We're retail, right?"
"8069930","8073290"," We're waiting for the banks to decide, are we getting bullish or not?"
"8073930","8076870"," And so we see more calls coming in to replace the call we had."
"8077730","8078710"," We can't be bullish."
"8094170","8097390"," All right, UNH, we've got double the buyers than we do sellers. "
"8098830","8108030"," Pretty decent support here at $4.51 and $4.30. Your price target on UNH is $5.01, which is"
"8108030","8108510"," really nice."
"8109390","8110070"," Good ticker."
"8110190","8110910"," Good shout out. "
"8111030","8112370"," I appreciate you calling that one out."
"8116110","8119010"," That might make a nice call spread."
"8119830","8126940"," Looks like you got some more by the dippers down here at $4.60 here. "
"8128100","8130080"," We get a little bit closer here and see where."
"8131760","8132960"," I think tight here."
"8135220","8139180"," I wish there was a hair indicator for this stock. "
"8141220","8148760"," $4.60, first price target, $4.71, then $4.74. Ultimately, you're looking for $500 on UNH."
"8149000","8150740"," Good shout out on that one, whoever did that one."
"8154790","8155310"," Marvel. "
"8176910","8178850"," Just saw some calls come in on SPX."
"8181110","8185690"," January 21st, $44.70 for $200,000."
"8230510","8233330"," Marvel's sitting on some nice major support here at $72. "
"8234490","8237570"," The only issue though is this is where the problem lies in this stuff, right?"
"8237990","8243270"," So we're talking about this when the market dumped yesterday and earlier this week, a few other"
"8243270","8244129"," days earlier this week."
"8244469","8246450"," You see stuff like this right here, right?"
"8247049","8251309"," And on the surface, it looks great, like Marvel's on major support."
"8252030","8253350"," Everything should be fine here. "
"8253850","8262129"," The problem comes in when you don't see a red line above, like $90, $100, there's nothing to shoot"
"8262129","8262490"," for."
"8263430","8268430"," So if you had a bunch of people buying Marvel calls at $90, you would see a big red line"
"8268430","8268770"," up here."
"8269610","8273889"," And you see this nice support down here, you can trade this up to $90 or close to it, let's"
"8273889","8274049"," say. "
"8275530","8281350"," But when you're not seeing any call structure above and you're just seeing major support here, all"
"8281350","8284430"," you need is a negative event and it begins to trade down."
"8284610","8285730"," It starts to free fall, actually."
"8286889","8291770"," So just trading sideways, you've got more sellers than buyers right now. "
"8292270","8296969"," So you're just grinding through your support area here at $72."
"8298370","8305690"," Sell the news would be $69.52. So be careful in here, you want to keep your eyes open for"
"8305690","8306850"," a call flow coming in on it."
"8306850","8311870"," If you don't see any call flow coming in and it starts to roll off, it should start to trade"
"8311870","8312129"," down. "
"8312270","8316629"," You'll see dealers will sell this support here down lower."
"8323770","8333690"," So firms support currently $72.21, $71.10, and $70.23. If the market gets spooked or any bad"
"8333690","8338590"," news comes out, you want to have a tight stop at $69.80 on Marvel."
"8340350","8356350"," I looked"
"8356350","8357309"," at Roblox, didn't I?"
"8358530","8359969"," I'm way behind in this chat. "
"8366389","8368530"," The base for volatility is pushing higher today."
"8369709","8370629"," I'm going to do you."
"8386780","8388760"," Unless Apple is buying us hilarious. "
"8391800","8393960"," Just scroll down here and see what you guys are at in the chat."
"8399610","8400570"," Peetons ripping."
"8402350","8403810"," Make this the spy show. "
"8422750","8423250"," June."
"8423930","8424670"," Hey, Winky."
"8424810","8425430"," What are you saying here?"
"8425550","8427030"," June 498C. "
"8427310","8427680"," 32,000."
"8428370","8429450"," Was that just bought?"
"8430230","8430370"," Winky."
"8433850","8434550"," Can you. "
"8435970","8439570"," If Winky's still here, if you can type something again about that June 498."
"8444740","8446140"," Yeah, I'll show Tesla again."
"8453900","8456120"," David wants some short exposure over the weekend. "
"8461130","8463790"," Yeah, I think we trade sideways into the close."
"8465510","8466690"," All right, here we go."
"8468410","8469450"," Has HAS. "
"8471310","8474090"," Pause, maybe I don't know what's about to pronounce HAS."
"8475090","8480590"," Four, 14, 22, 97.5. See."
"8482010","8485150"," 1.1 million dollars golden ticket. "
"8486930","8488520"," That's HAS."
"8490040","8492510"," Hotel Alpha Sierra, HAS."
"8493490","8500630"," April 14, 97.5, 1.1 million dollars and calls golden ticket with a follow up. "
"8502080","8502610"," HAS."
"8504860","8510070"," Call for April 14, 100 C for 2 million dollars."
"8512810","8514850"," So look up that one next. "
"8518560","8520140"," We'll do unity right now."
"8527380","8528670"," Same kind of a story on unity."
"8530350","8532730"," Sitting on some sport here 11149. "
"8533850","8534510"," 10602."
"8535810","8544370"," 101.27. You want to pull the plug at 98.71. Unless you're looking for a bounce."
"8546570","8548370"," It's kind of in the middle here, right?"
"8548890","8549450"," Diddler in the middle. "
"8550650","8554330"," 114.84 would be the price target if you're bullish on unity."
"8561830","8563090"," Hertz puts coming in."
"8564450","8567650"," February 18, 17.5 Hertz puts. "
"8574010","8574550"," HAS."
"8576690","8577230"," Hasbro."
"8587420","8589560"," A lot of calls coming in on hasbro right now. "
"8593260","8597840"," Two strikes, 97.5 and 100."
"8599240","8600040"," I like it."
"8606060","8608180"," Straighten up to this 97.5 right now. "
"8611000","8613840"," Another 2 million dollars to 100 up here."
"8615400","8616160"," I like it."
"8616300","8617580"," I like seeing this right here. "
"8618000","8619120"," Unlike some of those other tickers."
"8619960","8623240"," You see how you're seeing that 100 up here."
"8623240","8624900"," This is a nice price target to shoot for. "
"8625600","8626580"," I like hasbro."
"8626900","8627280"," Good job."
"8635680","8638480"," If you were looking to take entry in those, the follow those. "
"8640300","8641640"," By the dip at 95."
"8701780","8703180"," Yeah, you're not trading today, Brad."
"8707370","8708970"," It's just sideways movement, Brad. "
"8709210","8711170"," It's not really a big day in any way, shape or form."
"8711450","8713110"," I want to know what Winky was saying about those calls."
"8717090","8718390"," IWM is running to a spot. "
"8718650","8719970"," We'll look at IWM once again."
"8720370","8721030"," Just give me a second here."
"8721410","8722330"," Maybe test it once more. "
"8723710","8724350"," I'm scared."
"8734110","8734710"," Let's see if."
"8735350","8735830"," Hold on. "
"8735910","8736430"," What's Quinn saying?"
"8737970","8744680"," I feel shorting here is risky."
"8745880","8746680"," They bought all of them."
"8747260","8749160"," I got short short here, but I'm short right now. "
"8749160","8750560"," I would like to see this retraced lower."
"8751600","8754140"," Predict SPX 455 five close."
"8754680","8758420"," Thanks for the for the shout out, Danny, for the prediction on SPX. "
"8766170","8767650"," Speak for yourself, Cap."
"8767890","8769610"," I trade long and short and printed both ways."
"8769910","8770150"," What's that?"
"8774130","8774650"," Hilarious. "
"8781960","8783040"," Yeah, it's good to see."
"8788660","8792700"," So 47,000 calls for June 17th at 500."
"8792700","8793300"," 100, right?"
"8802920","8809300"," If you were bullish here, you'd want to see puts for June on SPY. "
"8811060","8812880"," Seeing calls on SPY."
"8816100","8817660"," Hold on Josh saying what?"
"8818040","8819440"," 28 CSPX 318."
"8820440","8821340"," Is this too risky?"
"8823400","8825300"," 318 SPXSS, I don't know. "
"8831320","8834040"," CRS, I'll look up CRSR next."
"8834920","8835960"," And IWM."
"8841790","8843730"," Watching some SPY calls come in. "
"8844290","8845950"," 121, 443 C."
"8848970","8851430"," 121, 443 C is again."
"8852050","8853410"," 83,000 in the first one."
"8853870","8855270"," 365,000 in the second one. "
"8856270","8859530"," Next rack is SPY 121, 444 C."
"8860290","8861530"," 117,000 dollars."
"8861950","8865550"," Total of roughly a half million on SPY going up currently."
"8867170","8868330"," All day trader stuff. "
"8880280","8881620"," Dip buyer, step it in."
"8884400","8885740"," 954, bounce."
"8889300","8889780"," 950. "
"8894130","8896130"," Vwops at 963."
"8897610","8898690"," Looks like we tested it once."
"8900070","8902710"," Probably tested again, one, two, and three all the way up. "
"8904890","8907690"," Someone here, I know trades SE."
"8910450","8916670"," Puts coming in on SE 218, 160 P for 660,000 dollars."
"8917710","8922270"," Price target remains on Tesla, 99880. "
"8931850","8946850"," CRSR. Man,"
"8946950","8949110"," I traded SE for almost the full year."
"8950170","8956370"," You could put like, you could place calls on SE, like month out, three month out calls on SE, and"
"8956370","8956830"," they just printed. "
"8958070","8962630"," Then I would sell down, you could buy some puts, would sell down, then start a whole other cycle."
"8963770","8965010"," SE was a great ticker to trade."
"8971690","8973410"," Some bulls coming in on the SPY. "
"8977760","8979680"," Actually a ramp coming in right here."
"8981000","8985120"," Seeing volume increase across the board on SPY currently."
"8986820","8990980"," Doubled the volume since this morning. "
"8996570","8998810"," It's going to be an interesting thing to watch right here."
"8999890","9001370"," Looks like some short covering."
"9006560","9010640"," It's a real point of contention here around 444 in the SPY right now. "
"9016010","9025740"," It failed up there around 12 o'clock."
"9031440","9033120"," I like this ticker a lot too."
"9033380","9035740"," Good job, I've ever called this ticker out. "
"9040460","9044860"," It's a good CRSR. It's a great ticker, good job, I've ever called this out."
"9045540","9047080"," I love seeing structure like this, right?"
"9048660","9050180"," So I see great structure, nice support. "
"9050960","9053960"," Price target above, $23, probably another one above that."
"9054960","9057440"," More buyers and sellers, good job, I've ever called this one out."
"9059940","9062080"," I like seeing this right here, this is nice. "
"9062960","9070580"," Take it to light resistance here at $23, $22.50, but you can have a nice price target $25."
"9071500","9075440"," Good job, I've ever called out CRSR. I like seeing this here. "
"9076340","9077900"," This means that bulls want it to go higher."
"9085670","9087490"," Another golden ticket just came in."
"9087490","9094930"," MIRNA, MRNA, April 14th, 155P for $1.6 million. "
"9101390","9102890"," Alright, what else you guys doing?"
"9103490","9109210"," Yeah, X has, I don't know, $20 million in puts on it right now."
"9109770","9110330"," Came out yesterday."
"9111390","9112270"," More puts this morning. "
"9123460","9124080"," Tesla."
"9125860","9132330"," The Holy Trinity went green again."
"9137840","9142440"," Hey, you guys can, uh, Hey, David, welcome back. "
"9150050","9153690"," You guys can easily take trades, just protect your trades that you're taking."
"9154270","9158950"," Instead of trading everything, uh, naked, right?"
"9159050","9160370"," Instead of just buying naked options."
"9164530","9167450"," You can make protected trades in both directions. "
"9179450","9181210"," Who is saying they were going to take along here?"
"9182210","9184230"," Someone was saying they wanted to take along into Tesla."
"9186210","9189730"," Part of me, this product says part of me just wants to take a Tesla."
"9191650","9196910"," 1080c 1100c spread for eight for, I believe he means eight or two 18. "
"9197830","9198850"," And wing it for ER."
"9199210","9199750"," Yeah, you can do that."
"9201190","9203530"," You know, in reality, what you do is. "
"9203530","9207570"," Uh, when's the big day for ERs for big tech, right?"
"9207650","9211450"," It's a few days for big tech ERs coming up."
"9213970","9214810"," Have a look at here."
"9215050","9215330"," Hold on. "
"9235970","9237350"," What am I looking at here?"
"9253980","9257940"," So you figure, you figure, if any guys out there that are bulls, you're like, I want to play."
"9260400","9261200"," Tech ERs."
"9264780","9265500"," You got S."
"9265600","9266640"," Well, I'm seeing the 26th. "
"9267960","9269740"," And then all of a sudden boom out of nowhere."
"9269740","9271180"," You've got Tesla, right?"
"9272600","9273620"," On the 26th."
"9276620","9282100"," You've got Intel in the 26th, Boeing in the 26th, Apple in the 27th. "
"9284100","9284700"," Robin Hood visa."
"9286440","9287700"," Caterpillar on that Friday."
"9288880","9290220"," You've got alphabet on the Monday. "
"9291920","9297590"," Get some spreading of big tech out."
"9297710","9299350"," It's not exella has bros."
"9299430","9300710"," Just heads up has bros. "
"9301690","9303610"," ER is on the 7th."
"9307330","9311930"," Let's say you want to trade the Tesla earnings and you think that you're bull."
"9312110","9312730"," You are bullish. "
"9316270","9319490"," You just take a call spread that expires on the 26th itself."
"9320630","9324510"," And then what you can do is you take a put spread farther data out."
"9327950","9329110"," Metas on the 2nd. "
"9331350","9333310"," Figure once all the big boys are out of the way."
"9336490","9337870"," Take it in the money put spread."
"9344190","9345170"," As well, right?"
"9345410","9346130"," So you can ride up. "
"9346430","9348190"," If you take the put spread farther dated."
"9350470","9351810"," Then the call spread."
"9351930","9353730"," Let's say the cost for the runs up into the ER. "
"9354510","9355610"," We trade up that thing, Prince."
"9356410","9357470"," Boom, you get a print."
"9358430","9362490"," And if we saw the market between now and then and you're having in the money put spread that"
"9362490","9365270"," expires much farther dated into sometime into February. "
"9366130","9367770"," Even if we trade up now."
"9368570","9370210"," Into the ER for Tesla."
"9371710","9375750"," I would assume that after all the big earnings comes out that we trade back down again. "
"9376650","9378070"," Once the big earnings are done."
"9378670","9380510"," You'll see us feel profits will be taken."
"9380910","9382470"," You'll see us trade back down. "
"9382870","9385610"," You could take like a market spread a put spread in."
"9387430","9388090"," Call it."
"9388990","9390010"," Middle of February. "
"9393070","9395190"," And take a shorter dated call spread on Tesla."
"9395750","9398550"," If that's your view, if you're like, Hey, I want to go long in Tesla."
"9402480","9404200"," You can just take it in the money call spread. "
"9404340","9405300"," Why even bother with 1080?"
"9405920","9407300"," Just do like an in the money call spread."
"9408040","9409580"," From now into the 26th."
"9412020","9412880"," Get a nice print. "
"9413280","9414520"," You can go slightly outside of the money."
"9414520","9416500"," Go to like 1040 or something, 1050."
"9418920","9420220"," Get a nice print off it. "
"9420300","9421100"," You feel like you participated."
"9423100","9427400"," And then you had you with some downside protection protection from then and from now until then."
"9428020","9429180"," And then you have to deal with day trading. "
"9431280","9433480"," So let's say your Tesla calls burn."
"9434880","9437400"," They're going to burn because your your puts are going to print."
"9439500","9440600"," You know that eventually. "
"9441600","9443580"," The market's going to want to retest, right?"
"9443580","9445040"," We know for a fact."
"9445480","9447040"," So our 442, right?"
"9447700","9450020"," You know for a fact that even let's say even we trade up here."
"9450080","9451860"," Let's say we trade up from 442 or 440. "
"9452460","9453560"," Let's we trade above 440."
"9454280","9455340"," I promise you."
"9456280","9460820"," We will be back down here, retesting this level at least once, if not twice more. "
"9461960","9463020"," Before we move up, move higher."
"9473380","9477660"," Yeah, so you don't have to wait to buy put spreads."
"9478180","9479900"," You're buying the put spreads for protection. "
"9480880","9483340"," So you buy like a we're at 442 right now."
"9483360","9484200"," You buy a 442."
"9485700","9487780"," Put spread expiring in mid February. "
"9492120","9493580"," And you'll we'll be back here."
"9493980","9496520"," We could trade up right now to 460."
"9497320","9498240"," Well, not for six. "
"9498360","9498860"," We could trade up."
"9499020","9504020"," I mean, I'm exaggerating, but if we trade higher, we'll still come back to retest at least once."
"9506300","9507840"," Unless we have a V shape recovery. "
"9508940","9511840"," But if we had a V shape recovery, it would have began today."
"9513660","9514060"," Right?"
"9514760","9516700"," If we're trading sideways right now."
"9519000","9520340"," That's no V shape recovery. "
"9526500","9527340"," Yeah, as a hedge."
"9530160","9534340"," So you figure like, let's say we get, let's say you're bullish, your stance is bullish."
"9535340","9537420"," You're like, look, there's no way we're selling off. "
"9538340","9539000"," Earnings reports."
"9540340","9541100"," Or big tech."
"9543060","9545940"," Okay, well, look at the week of big tech earnings. "
"9547360","9549480"," And you go slightly past that."
"9549660","9550660"," Like let's say two, three weeks."
"9551820","9556080"," And you know that people are going to take profit, even if we have a good ER for big tech. "
"9556820","9559680"," You know, people want to take profit off their lungs that they have."
"9562780","9563980"," So you have two chances."
"9564280","9566620"," You'll have the chance of us trading up higher from 442. "
"9567480","9570540"," And then a retest below again at 440 or whatever, 442."
"9571260","9576700"," And then you'll have another chance if we take profit on big tech, heading into the ERs."
"9577900","9582480"," Now, if your apple calls print and we don't come back to 442, it's not going to matter, right?"
"9583120","9585620"," Because you print it on your calls and app on Tesla. "
"9586520","9591240"," And if your test calls burn, you know that you're going to at least be paid for your time in"
"9591240","9591780"," trading Tesla."
"9592980","9594060"," And it'll be a double."
"9595460","9599820"," Winner if we trade up to Tesla and then we trade back down to on the spy. "
"9600940","9602060"," You'd print both sides."
"9604020","9605860"," We're down at 441 right now."
"9611290","9612450"," Myself, I'm not bullish. "
"9612810","9614670"," You guys know where my stance is right now."
"9622460","9624100"," See this nice little line down here?"
"9625960","9627140"," 435, baby."
"9629940","9630420"," 435. "
"9634100","9637160"," So you guys remember when I said 428."
"9640060","9642380"," You guys said no fucking way."
"9646180","9649680"," If we see 435 today. "
"9651840","9653020"," I'm going to be pretty shocked."
"9654040","9656260"," I'm not sure that we do, but if we see it, right?"
"9657420","9658500"," If we see it."
"9663140","9664260"," What's the next support?"
"9664360","9665040"," If we lose 444. "
"9665860","9665920"," 435."
"9668240","9669700"," God really, I'm bullish."
"9671160","9673260"," Is my discord all bears today?"
"9674640","9676360"," It's going to be really weird because. "
"9680300","9683120"," Hopefully those are bulls that have switched bearish."
"9686380","9690660"," And I'm just having attracted all the bears into my feed."
"9691800","9699500"," I like having bears here, but my hope is that I'm turning bulls into bears so that they don't lose"
"9699500","9700140"," their bank. "
"9701300","9707280"," That's my hope is that normally bullish traders are seeing this market for what it is."
"9708000","9713400"," They're able to make the transition as a trader would and know that we're in a very bearish context"
"9713400","9714100"," in the market."
"9715100","9716260"," Okay. "
"9717400","9718860"," Here's more put flow."
"9719560","9726120"," QQQ February 18th 350 P 2.4 million dollars."
"9726400","9732140"," 2.4 million dollars. "
"9732140","9732600"," Man."
"9734760","9735460"," QQQ."
"9737040","9740180"," 350 P 2.4 million dollars. "
"9740180","9745820"," You know, if I saw this, if I saw all of this in call flow, I would tell you we're"
"9745820","9746700"," going to have a V shape recovery."
"9746700","9748160"," I'm going to blast off to the moon."
"9748960","9751460"," But seeing this on the other side has me concerned. "
"9752800","9756140"," Again, once again, it's one 24 in the afternoon."
"9756800","9759220"," I have some concerns heading into the bell."
"9768610","9772390"," Watching millions, 10 million blocks, 10 million dollar blocks. "
"9774530","9778430"," Coming in against the major indexes and meanwhile, Peton."
"9780930","9782070"," Is up."
"9784430","9785890"," Is up today. "
"9786490","9799420"," 12.8%. Just watch"
"9799420","9804460"," another set of cues come in February 18th 350 P."
"9805260","9806720"," 800,000 dollars."
"9806800","9809500"," I got to tell you guys, I'm going to warn you guys one more time today."
"9810280","9812580"," We're going to have to have this talk again today. "
"9817450","9819510"," These are not your normal hedges."
"9821310","9825010"," These hedges are very short dated."
"9826310","9828590"," Two week out hedges are not normal. "
"9832970","9836630"," And there comes a point in the market."
"9839710","9844650"," Where they not only you're looking at put flow and hedge flow, two different things are you have"
"9844650","9845790"," put hedges and puts."
"9846910","9851050"," But there becomes us like a cascading waterfall effect. "
"9852770","9858430"," It's the same thing when you see big runs like when you see Tesla run up 200 300 points like"
"9858430","9859810"," huge moves in the market."
"9860130","9864570"," When you see soft banks step in and they just start hammering the market with calls."
"9865210","9870270"," Millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars in calls and"
"9870270","9871050"," we rip higher. "
"9871530","9872950"," And there's nothing that you can do about it."
"9874090","9877070"," You don't trade against it, right?"
"9877070","9882010"," And so as a bull when we're talking about that when we're talking about that stuff and we're saying"
"9882010","9882490"," hey look."
"9882910","9887250"," There's so much gamma coming in on the on the call side that we're going up. "
"9887370","9888730"," There's nothing you can you can't stop it."
"9889950","9892570"," That's happening right now on the put side."
"9895230","9898010"," They know that like everything in your bones tells you. "
"9899890","9902350"," We're at a bottom we can't trade down any farther."
"9903170","9905730"," But if you were to turn your monitor upside down."
"9907430","9909750"," We're not we're not that far at a bottom right now. "
"9913570","9919930"," Just saw some SPX calls come in January 24th 4 4 5 5."
"9922110","9923150"," $650,000."
"9938590","9943230"," So they're just stacking them right now stacking up puts for February 18th."
"9955930","9958230"," Yeah, someone saying discord seems pretty balanced. "
"9958450","9958770"," That's good."
"9959890","9961430"," Yeah, well, you want to hear both sides."
"9961810","9964290"," You definitely never especially right now on the downside. "
"9965150","9969690"," You want to be listening to bulls as well because of a bull says something that meet that matters."
"9970350","9972250"," We don't want to miss that case."
"9972270","9973350"," We do draw trade higher. "
"9973830","9975270"," Let me know in the chat real quick."
"9975810","9978450"," If you think that we're heading up into Monday."
"9978970","9983190"," If you think we're getting our Monday Vana rally or if you think we trade down on Monday. "

"10050680","10052840"," We'll do the opposite of the closes today."
"10054340","10055220"," Down the reverse."
"10055500","10059940"," I think that the clothes could be insane and the risk there feels like it is to the upside. "
"10060220","10066900"," What the fuck do I know post opx washout down today higher Monday."

"10082640","10086420"," The discord invitation is down the description of this video."
"10093200","10100860"," Yeah, I think that I think that we trade up on Monday. "
"10100860","10107390"," I think we trade higher Monday than we sell down into FOMC."
"10108970","10111910"," And then I think we trade down to that for 28 level."
"10113170","10114770"," 435 somewhere down in there. "
"10115970","10118710"," I think we trade up into Monday."

"10157810","10159330"," But still no real money. "
"10159450","10160290"," It's been 20 grand."
"10167780","10169300"," Cut a nice bounce here."
"10176030","10178390"," If you want to follow Lucid calls. "
"10180590","10183270"," Just keep your eye on the interest that that strike."
"10184890","10186710"," January 21th 38c."
"10188210","10189510"," It costs 40 cents. "
"10190710","10191410"," Money bottom."
"10194530","10196970"," And as long as the guy doesn't sell them should be pretty good."

"10224770","10226930"," I remember you said you were going to hella ski, right?"
"10232520","10236500"," Jason, what do you think we do into the close and then into the open Monday and then into"
"10236500","10236700"," Wednesday?"
"10237360","10238420"," We're all we're all putting our."

"10279820","10281540"," Yeah, it'll become a traders market."
"10281660","10283280"," It definitely won't become an investors market."
"10290120","10296420"," Bloodstun saying that someone sold $7.1 million in 3,000 puts and about 4.4 million in 3,000"

"10343800","10345800"," What's the funny meme that I meet Kev posted?"
"10346400","10347200"," Meet Kevin posted. "
"10355030","10355930"," Yeah, no opinion."
"10356330","10358190"," Just watching playing price action off opening range."
"10358370","10359390"," I can't predict shit right now. "
"10359390","10360490"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"10360630","10361810"," That's David as well, Jason."
"10365010","10366690"," I'm just watching the flow at this point. "
"10366870","10368230"," I've got some puts out on Peton."
"10371390","10372410"," Heading into their ER."
"10381310","10384130"," Yeah, I had some puts fill on Peton that way today. "
"10385190","10388770"," I put a bit way below the ask and they filled."
"10396480","10400640"," Talking monthly saying, yeah, the bears are probably talking about this somewhere else out there."
"10401360","10407480"," Talking monkey is bringing up a point that the bears are probably talking about. "
"10412770","10414770"," It's not quite the monthly support either."
"10414910","10421670"," You guys want to be paying attention to how we close this week out."
"10433620","10436000"," How we close the month out is critical as well. "
"10437100","10438260"," We'll look back here right now."
"10438460","10439340"," When did we start the month?"
"10451240","10453860"," Yeah, so if we close this week negative."
"10455240","10457480"," And then we end up closing this month on the negative. "
"10460420","10463820"," If we close negative on this month, which it looks like we're going to."
"10465380","10466520"," That sets up."
"10467760","10468580"," The quarter. "
"10469400","10470160"," To be negative."
"10471140","10471580"," Right?"
"10471920","10472280"," Because you'd have."
"10476710","10477890"," Yeah, January negative. "
"10478070","10480650"," And then if we, well, it sets up the following month, I should say."
"10481250","10482950"," It sets up February to be negative."
"10483330","10485410"," And then if you get March negative, you'd set up the quarter. "
"10485910","10489350"," If you see the quarter negative, that's bad news."
"10498600","10500800"," So I just have some questions about that."
"10502920","10504240"," For where we are in the market. "
"10504380","10507540"," I think we probably trade up on Monday at some point Monday, Tuesday."
"10508560","10509580"," I don't know how high."
"10511880","10513340"," And then I think we sell down. "
"10514660","10515460"," Once more."
"10522470","10522930"," JPM."
"10524190","10525110"," May 20th. "

"10546860","10548580"," Yeah, Josh is legend."
"10548880","10549160"," He's a man. "
"10549540","10550380"," He's awesome sauce."
"10550720","10551220"," Love that guy."
"10555700","10561640"," Ma'am is treating with his major volume and 4400 ESF puts for end of month. "
"10563020","10565720"," What do you guys think of this trade for a double FOMC?"
"10567420","10568940"," Paul spreads 30 cents."
"10569140","10570820"," Everybody knows Tesla's going to have killer."
"10570980","10573640"," But that will matter too much unless FOMC is devilish. "
"10574080","10578160"," Some wild shit today underlying stock alerts going off constantly."
"10578760","10579440"," It's by his ranging."
"10579780","10581680"," Yeah, I agree with that sideways, baby. "
"10588260","10592080"," Do I have charts of the last 12 Opex days for spy?"
"10593960","10594680"," On the monthly?"
"10595160","10595920"," Yeah, I do."
"10596460","10596740"," I had it."
"10596820","10599260"," Well, you haven't charted out for a little for a long time. "
"10599260","10601920"," And then I wiped my charts clean of those."
"10610390","10613590"," When I look at my my contention is that we're going down."
"10613850","10618890"," So right now I'm looking at how we traded in March of 2020. "
"10622320","10623880"," So I think that we trade higher."
"10625580","10627320"," And then I think we sell off once more."
"10630240","10631460"," It could happen fast. "
"10646930","10648510"," You guys are savages on spy."
"10664240","10666220"," I do think it can get wild in the close today."
"10670910","10671970"," And on Monday, Tuesday. "
"10687190","10690810"," There have been three or four in the last 18 months where it trades like shit all day long and"
"10690810","10692890"," then in the last 50 minutes it goes up 10 to 20 points."
"10693150","10695250"," Yeah, I'm thinking that same thing."
"10696030","10696390"," Winky. "
"10700250","10701970"," Yeah, I'm in a boatload of calls right now."
"10702490","10702770"," Cheap calls."
"10704150","10704650"," For the close. "
"10714640","10716380"," I'm in a bunch of dirt cheap calls."
"10717280","10718580"," I'm betting on that happening."
"10718580","10719680"," It's pure gamble, but. "
"10721520","10723680"," Do I have thoughts on Bitcoin over the weekend cap?"
"10727500","10729160"," We tank deeper today."
"10729780","10731960"," Yeah, I think there's a possibility we could trade down to 435."
"10735280","10737660"," I think there's a real chance that we could trade down here. "
"10741320","10742100"," Right here."
"10743300","10744980"," It supports firming up at 440."
"10745020","10746040"," This is good to see. "
"10746260","10746840"," You want to see this?"
"10748340","10751100"," I think the potential to trade down to 435 at some point."
"10752160","10753260"," I don't think it's 100%."
"10753680","10754900"," And I don't think it's like guaranteed. "
"10755400","10756560"," I don't think it's a 90% chance."
"10758780","10762220"," I'm holding the bull load of zero dates for the close."
"10767010","10769590"," If there's a short covering operation into the close. "
"10769590","10840630"," Look at"
"10840630","10841010"," that here."
"10848610","10852550"," Yeah, I've got a rack full of 450 C's."
"10858760","10863420"," And I'm hoping that we squeeze up into the bell on spy. "
"10865160","10867440"," Maybe it carries over into Monday."
"10868560","10869860"," And then we trade deeper."
"10871160","10872380"," That's my plan at least. "
"10872700","10874760"," I don't I don't recommend any of you follow that plan."
"10888300","10889680"," Is it 1.3 trillion?"
"10889840","10893540"," I thought it was 1.3 billion rolling off at the end of the day."
"10906200","10909860"," Yeah, we got 1.3 billion rolling off today, end of day. "
"10911880","10913420"," So I've got dirt cheap calls."
"10913680","10916680"," They cost, I don't know, 10 cents or something."
"10920870","10923430"," For a short covering into the close today. "
"10927770","10928530"," Watching spy."
"10928950","10930710"," Well, a few things I'm watching right now."
"10931370","10932490"," M R N A."
"10934130","10940050"," Myrna March 18 1 55 P for 1.3 million dollars. "
"10940630","10944610"," Spy calls 1 21 4 47 C."
"10950100","10951460"," Snap calls."
"10952360","10955400"," February 18 34 C for $300,000."
"10955780","10961300"," QQ Q calls January 21 3 59 C for $69,000. "
"10962300","10972300"," Spy calls January 26 44 44 calls for $537,000."
"10973460","10980240"," More spy calls January 21 4 47 C for $50,000."
"10982100","10988450"," It's not 1.3 trillion. "
"10989310","10992110"," It's 1.26 billion."
"11001850","11004030"," It's 1.26 billion."
"11005730","11008130"," Even if zero hedge said trillion. "
"11010310","11014530"," It's 1.26 billion, I think, unless I got that wrong."
"11016650","11020970"," You'd have to, I would check zero hedge against other sources."
"11028330","11035010"," Or no, I should say it's 1.26 billion in call delta rolling off today. "
"11039250","11043870"," And you don't know, there's some other, there's some other walkiness behind that information as"
"11043870","11044090"," well."
"11044630","11048570"," You don't know how that, that call those calls are hedged."
"11053350","11058270"," You don't know if these deep in the money calls are going to be converted to shares. "
"11063340","11067380"," There's a whole bunch of small mechanics in the background and what takes place when that happens."
"11068220","11072460"," And then we still don't know what's going to come out for structure at the end of the day."
"11073140","11078980"," We could be sitting here being very bullish or bearish and the last half an hour, last 45 minutes,"
"11079680","11080700"," last 15 minutes. "
"11081280","11084040"," You could see $60 million in calls roll in the front door."
"11085620","11091640"," And all of a sudden, if you're super hella bearish, you're going to get screwed."
"11101730","11105550"," So I think my thought is, you know, you've got a small percent chance that we're going to trade"
"11105550","11106050"," down to 435. "
"11107530","11108390"," That's down here."
"11109190","11112410"," We get swooped down and then swoop up into the close."
"11114250","11118710"," You know, option number two is that we just swoop up from this 440 or whatever, this big base that"
"11118710","11120470"," we have, short covering in the close. "
"11123350","11127690"," And then your next option would be we panic sell down into the close, right?"
"11128670","11132350"," Just slam down, slam four, 28, let's call it."
"11134170","11136450"," Just sell the news again like we have all week long."
"11140920","11150300"," And I think that that's going to depend upon what happens to those calls, what kind of hedging we"
"11150300","11151040"," see into the close. "
"11153440","11156380"," It's 147 in the afternoon, so we'll start to see what happens."
"11160020","11162220"," Between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. we'll know, right?"
"11162520","11163220"," What's going to take place?"
"11164460","11167380"," I guess option four would be that we just trade sideways right into the bell."
"11168680","11170340"," And it's a big thank you for playing. "
"11172560","11174460"," Better luck next time, we'll see you on Monday."
"11184530","11191150"," Watching more QQQ puts in in line here, January 21, 358 p for $200,000."
"11194150","11197050"," Almost looks like a pin, a pinning on the cues, right?"
"11223470","11227610"," Almost as if a bunch of players want the price at a certain price at the close today. "
"11229110","11239100"," Almost as if you're going to park it like Sally wants to"
"11239100","11239500"," park it."
"11244040","11246640"," Yeah, that's my one problem, everybody in the grandmas holding puts."
"11250670","11257250"," Yeah, you want to confirm that 1.8 trillion with another source, not just here. "
"11257390","11258730"," Let me show you guys something, hold on a second."
"11261270","11263070"," Let me see if I'm wrong."
"11264910","11268730"," Because just because what's this face says that doesn't make it so either. "
"11269330","11269850"," Hold on."
"11270830","11271950"," I'm going to check right now."
"11280110","11281670"," Give me just a second here. "
"11287150","11289990"," It might be trillion, it might just be misspeaking right now."
"11305960","11307880"," Give me just a second, let me take a look here."
"11309040","11309680"," 2018. "
"11347600","11353420"," Yeah, so this is what I'm going to tell you, okay?"
"11354520","11356480"," I'm going to be very clear here, okay?"
"11362670","11364370"," Who hasn't that released that?"
"11366010","11367450"," Zero hedge is wrong."
"11386770","11388990"," So zero hedge is wrong."
"11389970","11392010"," I'm going to be very clear on this. "
"11394090","11401150"," It's not 1.7 or 6 trillion, it's 1.26 billion in call delta."
"11403110","11404530"," That's rolling off today."
"11405250","11406530"," I don't know why they got that wrong. "
"11408130","11409690"," It's billion, not trillion."
"11412590","11415350"," So zero hedge is wrong, probably just a spelling error."
"11416350","11418610"," I don't care what rotors has, they're wrong too. "
"11419710","11420550"," I know they're wrong."
"11425270","11425930"," It's billion."
"11434000","11440000"," My assumption is that someone got the billions and trillions mixed up, and now everybody's"
"11440000","11440700"," spreading it around. "
"11441460","11441880"," It's billion."
"11445470","11446930"," Well, they're not talking about the delta."
"11456040","11461520"," That's 1.26 billion in call delta rolling off. "
"11462400","11464440"," I think that's what it was the other day."
"11470440","11473360"," It's the largest roll off of call delta in history."
"11489850","11500440"," These are people that, these are people that bought calls in major big tech companies that"
"11500440","11504660"," are now deep in the money that expire today. "
"11509150","11510710"," I'll show you guys who I just want to see it."
"11510810","11511670"," I'll bring it up for you."
"11512050","11514170"," We've been talking about this for what, two weeks, right?"
"11516850","11518730"," Before it was in the news, we were talking about it. "
"11519250","11520250"," I can show you the chart."
"11524380","11526060"," I got the chart sitting right in front of me."
"11547160","11550320"," Matter of fact, here is the spot camera note on this, right?"
"11551540","11553040"," January Opex is next week. "
"11553240","11556520"," There are large deep in the money, single stock options positions open."
"11557040","11560640"," There's something north of $100 billion in notional call delta is expiring."
"11561620","11564280"," Later on, he doesn't know where he talks about the specific number. "
"11564380","11570920"," It's 1.26 or 1.26 billion in notional call delta is expiring."
"11571080","11577620"," As the dealers are thought to be short, those calls and hedged with long stock, the sale of hedges"
"11577620","11585020"," tied to those expiring positions may pressure these stocks, some of which are in short gamma."
"11585860","11588920"," All that means is that on the further weakness, dealers will add pressure. "
"11589720","11595320"," It's a feedback loop that likely ends with the dealers reset in gamma exposure post-OPEX."
"11596220","11605240"," That's on Monday, but with that being said, there's increased potential for instability as long as"
"11605240","11609420"," participants maintain SPX prices below $4,700."
"11610980","11615260"," But there's more problems here is that we didn't have the put flow and the hedge flow that we've"
"11615260","11618960"," had come in since then and not having more call flow to replace. "
"11620000","11623220"," This call delta rolling off is a problem."
"11624600","11629780"," At this point, at least it is."
"11633420","11635820"," Welcome to the casino, where affordances are gained and lost. "
"11638620","11644060"," Not necessarily because the dealers become neutral at that point, right?"
"11646140","11647100"," Everything's fair, right?"
"11647320","11647760"," Everything is weighted."
"11648880","11650660"," It doesn't mean that it's down next week."
"11650860","11655540"," It means that the dealers are trying to get neutral into the end of day today. "
"11658140","11665640"," Off of that trade, the problem lies in what comes into the market to replace that stuff."
"11667000","11674440"," And what's been added this past week is negative flow, not positive flow."
"11675880","11677440"," Okay, you guys ready?"
"11678440","11683580"," By January 21, 440P, $63,000. "
"11683960","11693820"," By February 25, 420 puts $1.6 million, $1.6 million in February 25"
"11693820","11695640"," puts on the market."
"11696940","11707990"," So the"
"11707990","11717800"," point is that you want to be seeing a call flow to replace this call"
"11717800","11718060"," flow."
"11718260","11723560"," If you don't see the call flow to replace this call flow in any meaningful size, not a million"
"11723560","11733360"," dollars, talking like millions, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100, you know, million dollars per"
"11733360","11737080"," in the spy, $100 million in a bunch of other big tickers. "
"11737660","11739900"," If you don't see that replaced, right?"
"11740460","11747000"," And you see these calls roll off and the dealers are trying to get neutral, right?"
"11747700","11751440"," Into Monday, but you see a bunch of flow coming in on the negative side."
"11753100","11754320"," What does that tell you?"
"11763450","11764490"," I'll take a look at that."
"11764850","11766510"," I wasn't paying attention to Darkpool. "
"11774370","11775190"," Yeah, I see that."
"11775330","11776630"," I see some at one o'clock as well."
"11778030","11785570"," Winky 1253, 1247, all in the red, DIA, 1244 this afternoon. "
"11788330","11789750"," He was at 1238."
"11798500","11803860"," The only other thing that I can think about here that might be bullish would be if they're trying"
"11803860","11808980"," to get neutral into the end of the day that we might possibly come up because of the deep selling"
"11808980","11809540"," that we've had."
"11810480","11815500"," And so they're going to try to park it at the end of the day to where everything is fair,"
"11815780","11815820"," right?"
"11822580","11826580"," No, this isn't, this is none of this hedging has anything to do with Ukraine. "
"11827160","11829380"," None of this hedging has anything to do with FOMC."
"11829860","11831780"," Well, it kind of does have to do with FOMC."
"11834380","11837580"," Well, that's the other side of the argument, George, and I agree with that. "
"11837680","11838760"," That's the other side of the argument."
"11839510","11845460"," If all of these calls are exercised and they buy the shares, it would make all things equal."
"11848620","11853940"," But if they don't exercise these calls, right, they take the money and run. "
"11855220","11858540"," And then the dealers no longer have to hedge."
"11860720","11863820"," And you've got negative, puts coming into the market."
"11864320","11866680"," You've got negative hedging coming into the market too, right?"
"11866680","11871720"," Those three amplifications can have some really devastating impact on our market. "
"11873280","11874860"," But there is that other side of that argument."
"11875020","11876220"," I agree with that other side of the argument."
"11876640","11879620"," So whoever brought that up, George, I agree with you on that. "
"11879940","11880720"," And that is a question."
"11881040","11883300"," Nobody knows that answer heading into close today."
"11889560","11894140"," In your view, there's almost no chance that JPM and other large participants knew that they wanted"
"11894140","11898260"," to park the market at less than 4, 36, 3 months ago. "
"11898660","11899680"," No, we do."
"11899680","11907940"," I know that we did, because I remember on last OPEX, I can probably even bring this side."
"11908100","11913320"," I think I can look back here, but I can probably show you the flow that came in. "
"11916280","11917180"," Inside here."
"11921190","11930610"," So back on December 3rd, have a little look back on December"
"11930610","11931270"," 3rd."
"11932890","11937750"," And as a matter of fact, you can check on, I think I'm going to post this on Twitter. "
"11939530","11945410"," As a matter of fact, Eric Hagar talked about this as well back in December on the 3rd."
"11946010","11947290"," Could be a good source for this."
"11949450","11955890"," There was extreme hedge buying on December 3rd. "
"11960320","11964620"," Extreme hedge buying down in the 420s, down in the 440s."
"11967940","11969380"," And here we are again."
"11970320","11974260"," So you've got this, we're working inside of this massive megaphone, right?"
"11974640","11976900"," And eventually someone's going to get shaken loose by it. "
"11978900","11980680"," Let me see if I can look that flow up."
"11980840","11981000"," Hold on."
"11982420","11987460"," If I can find it and post it to you right now on this stream, I will. "
"11989720","11992820"," I think I'm going to look and check and see if I can actually search for this."
"11997650","12000510"," I actually call them out to you if I can find them."
"12002290","12003430"," Snapshot by date. "
"12004790","12005850"," Did I do January?"
"12009030","12018980"," Let me"
"12018980","12020040"," just a second here."
"12020810","12022320"," I'll find the flow for you."
"12041940","12042560"," Okay, you ready?"
"12044700","12046240"," I got something for you. "
"12047870","12057680"," On December 13th at 11.32 a.m. 5.5 million"
"12057680","12065280"," dollars in IWM 206 puts were purchased."
"12066980","12074490"," For January 21st, IWM"
"12074490","12080150"," 5 million inputs purchased on IWM."
"12081930","12085200"," Like straight up hellscape. "
"12086080","12087360"," We find the spy stuff."
"12088360","12088780"," I think type."
"12092080","12092920"," Millions. "
"12094240","12097180"," I've got another million dollars January 21st, 206."
"12100100","12109230"," Looking for here."
"12111210","12111810"," Of one. "
"12112390","12114410"," Of one was the other day when a lot of bearish."
"12115270","12117670"," Crazy ass bearish put flow came in."
"12119870","12122050"," This guy's been planning this shit for so long. "
"12125870","12127610"," So they were planning it back in December."
"12129610","12131530"," IWM, right?"
"12132350","12132710"," Millions."
"12133710","12138370"," I mean straight millions in put flow for today. "
"12139290","12140750"," Bought on 12-1."
"12142910","12145970"," Aspiring today, January 21, specifically today."
"12147830","12149150"," Spy, right?"
"12157700","12158720"," Let's see here. "
"12159980","12163260"," Not a ton on spy, but a shit ton on IWM."
"12175570","12177530"," These guys knew exactly what they were doing."
"12178970","12180650"," And they know that it was coming down here. "
"12196140","12197580"," They knew exactly what they were doing."
"12197580","12200260"," They knew exactly what they were doing selling this market down into today."
"12201160","12202420"," They knew it back in December. "
"12210370","12211610"," They knew it two months ago."
"12211610","12212390"," They were coming down here."
"12213910","12215190"," We reverse Zack Morris. "
"12217590","12218650"," It's probably the easier."
"12219130","12221570"," If you had to look at all of them, if you had to look at spy cues."
"12223870","12225530"," IWM was probably the easiest one to short. "
"12250380","12253640"," Keep it nice and pinned down here for, you know, prints today."
"12253640","12255000"," Everybody get paid."
"12259740","12261580"," Right dealers, dealers get paid. "
"12262440","12264840"," Market makers get paid, banks get paid."
"12273400","12280780"," It'd be hilarious to see if Peton trades to 30 bucks, recovers all everything today."
"12281280","12281780"," It would be hilarious. "
"12302630","12306150"," Meanwhile, Amazon can't regain any ground today."
"12306830","12308150"," But Peton's coming back, Bailey."
"12323710","12325330"," They made a ton of money. "
"12329380","12330300"," No, not well."
"12330840","12332540"," So we don't really predict the moves."
"12332840","12337140"," What we do is we traditionally chart out the market, right?"
"12337540","12339820"," We watch the volume and market profile. "
"12342080","12348000"," We track order flow on the dome, right, for actual on book map, right?"
"12348460","12350820"," We watch options order flow and track them over time."
"12356810","12359090"," Watch for gamma levels for volatility levels."
"12359090","12359730"," We trade it. "
"12360530","12362050"," And it works out most of the time."
"12367740","12368640"," So let's get out of you."
"12368700","12369160"," What's out of you?"
"12369240","12369980"," We're at right now. "
"12370600","12373340"," Let's see if they're going to print these puts, right?"
"12385100","12386640"," It looks like they're going to print them."
"12406450","12409650"," And then it being an Opax, you're tracking all the hedging that's coming in."
"12411470","12414310"," And in a healthy market, you're looking for hedging. "
"12414350","12418070"," That's one, two, three months out or more than a month."
"12418130","12421430"," You're probably looking for like a month is not safe."
"12421690","12424470"," You want to really see like three months out, six months out. "
"12426150","12428030"," So these guys can take the market long."
"12428410","12432450"," But when you're seeing like market hedges that are two weeks out, that's pretty scary."
"12447000","12449880"," Yeah, it was a wild day, Emerson, for sure. "
"12456010","12460570"," Yeah, I got some puts on Peton for their ER."
"12460570","12462270"," So we'll see what happens on their ER."
"12463190","12469990"," The fact that they've traded back to their original price and Amazon hasn't. "
"12470450","12471270"," It's kind of telling."
"12474450","12476790"," And last night's video, we talked about that, right?"
"12479270","12481550"," That thanks don't like unknown news."
"12482490","12485390"," They don't like to be caught with their pants down, whether it's going up or down. "
"12485390","12490890"," If we trade higher on unknown news, they always bring it back down so that they can get in so"
"12490890","12491930"," that they can ride it up."
"12492450","12494790"," Same thing happens when we have unknown news that drops a stock."
"12494990","12499550"," You'll see it typically see it trade higher again so that they can sell out of their positions and"
"12499550","12500410"," leave you with the bags. "
"12507320","12509160"," It's kind of like a timeout rule, right?"
"12509360","12510640"," It's like your older brother's there."
"12511000","12512220"," You're fighting with your older brother."
"12512920","12514840"," And he's allowed to beat you up whenever he wants. "
"12515080","12516380"," And the moment you sock him in the mouth."
"12517100","12518460"," He says, timeout."
"12519540","12522660"," And because he's bigger than you, you have to be forced into a timeout. "
"12523400","12524160"," We're in the inverse."
"12524780","12527460"," You know, you don't get no, your older brother just keeps beating you up."
"12530860","12537470"," It depends on where they bottom. "
"12543350","12546710"," But typically you'll see it in an OPEC's last 15 minutes or so."
"12547090","12548130"," You'll see some wild moves."
"12548910","12551770"," You'll see some really jagged moves on specific tickers. "
"12551770","12553710"," Sometimes I try to get it done in the morning."
"12553950","12555610"," The others try to get it done end of day."
"12559570","12562870"," Yeah, I don't know about when to short, Peton or when not to. "
"12563130","12568650"," All I know is that I mean, I don't care if my I don't care if my long puts don't"
"12568650","12568870"," print."
"12569470","12570090"," I'll buy him again."
"12570890","12572610"," I'll buy him again and I'll buy him again. "
"12574130","12577950"," Peton has no business being at 30 at 28 bucks, nor 30."
"12581030","12585570"," Even when I was even, even when Peton was coming down pre that news coming out."
"12586830","12591690"," My position was that even if Peton didn't go bankrupt, it's a $10 stock. "
"12592630","12593430"," That's what it is."
"12597840","12599180"," No, I don't think it's dumb to hold."
"12599380","12601000"," I think you guys all should take your own positions. "
"12602520","12605140"," And have your own stance on where you think we're going."
"12608180","12610520"," The safest bet is to not trade today, right?"
"12610720","12612020"," Last night's video we talked about it."
"12612080","12613230"," I told you, we'll trade sideways today. "
"12614960","12618720"," And we, oh, first I said, we'll trade down more than likely, which we did right off the bell."
"12618880","12620240"," And then we'll trade sideways into the close."
"12620980","12622940"," That's to be expected on an OPEC state. "
"12623220","12625180"," The banks have their own stuff they have to do."
"12625640","12630940"," They have to position themselves for the following month and into the next quarterly."
"12632980","12633420"," Right?"
"12633560","12635160"," They position themselves back in January. "
"12635840","12640120"," And now as we're getting closer into February, they're going to adjust their positions for March."
"12644890","12646450"," So did they do this stuff today?"
"12646670","12649950"," They've got a bunch of shit that's expiring today, so they're going to stabilize by."
"12650510","12653170"," And then there'll be brief moments of chaotic trading. "
"12666900","12668800"," So I guess you have to pick a poison, right?"
"12669520","12672400"," Do you think we trade down into the close?"
"12672400","12674420"," Do you think we trade up into the close?"
"12674660","12675800"," Do they just park it into the close?"
"12676640","12679940"," And then what's the impact on Monday?"
"12680420","12683980"," I don't know what that is right now."
"12684040","12685700"," Right now I'm just watching to see what they do."
"12688220","12689800"," Yeah, the range trading is doing good. "
"12717530","12718730"," I think everybody's waiting."
"12718850","12723930"," If I had to guess everybody's waiting to see what the banks do into the close today to determine"
"12723930","12724630"," where we're going."
"12725170","12729150"," One thing that I would make a note of is I haven't seen a ton of call flow. "
"12730090","12734590"," You're not going to see like a bank by $100 million in spy puts."
"12735630","12740890"," And then then some rando like me buy $100,000 in calls and it's going to go up to 480."
"12742890","12749710"," I'm not going to push the banks to trade us to 480 on $100,000 calls on SPX. "
"12749710","12754670"," And on that note, this is nice to see."
"12755850","12762210"," SPX calls February 18th, 4480 for $2.9 million."
"12764750","12766310"," Whatever hedge fund did that. "
"12766530","12766830"," Thank you."
"12770090","12774750"," Yeah, you want to see a better waiting on the call side of this market heading into close today."
"12775290","12778970"," You want to see more call flow come into the market into close today?"
"12780450","12783610"," Offset the heavy put side that's come into the market at this point. "
"12786170","12791710"," We just saw some SPX calls come in $2.9 million February 18th."
"12798570","12802210"," You have to look at this from the perspective if we if you were bullish here."
"12802670","12807590"," You're going to want to not see so many close stated hedge call a hedge puts. "
"12807770","12811690"," You're going to want to see an overwhelming leaning to the to the call side."
"12811690","12817550"," And in the healthy market, you'd see calls and puts coming in."
"12817670","12820230"," But right now everything is weighted towards the put side. "
"12820990","12823430"," Although we are starting to see some calls come in for SPX."
"12823830","12825750"," So that's good dukes."
"12830880","12832060"," Short dated though. "
"12834440","12835440"," February 18th."
"12835440","12836940"," Please just bear no bull."
"12840960","12842720"," Can't believe I got all these bears in here. "
"12850860","12852720"," I can't believe I have so many bears in here."
"12856340","12857420"," Yeah, I just centered some calls."
"12857420","12859200"," I'm in some 10 cent calls right now. "
"12859940","12862060"," We'll see if they up the down to seven cents."
"12862640","12865220"," So they're we're they're weaning out my four fifties."
"12868180","12871240"," I'm going to hold these into the call into the close, I believe. "
"12871760","12873560"," I think there might be some short covering in the close."
"12875300","12876580"," They were dirt cheap, so."
"12878640","12879640"," We'll see if they print. "
"12880280","12881520"," Or they might just put it into the bell."
"12883240","12888620"," There's like 350,000 contracts out on 440 P."
"12889660","12890460"," Expiring today."
"12911850","12914410"," Uber had a nice recovery from this morning's call flow. "
"12915770","12919230"," Spotify had a nice recovery this morning from that call flow."
"12922190","12925670"," I want to check out hood real quick and see if there's buyers on hood."
"12926710","12927630"," Hood's on my short list. "
"12928230","12930490"," I traded down to a nice price this morning."
"12940050","12942910"," I think that today is more of a waiting waiting game day for me."
"12943170","12945690"," Or you just sell the rips by the dips. "
"12951740","12953100"," Yeah, I'll take a look at XPI."
"12959420","12963060"," David saying that all three markets are at near 20% correction."
"12965880","12967140"," Yeah, Spy isn't. "
"12967460","12969240"," NDX is near 20% correction."
"12973460","12975540"," Nasdaq said near 20%."
"12975540","12978700"," I think Spy might have hit 10% today, David. "
"12998410","13001050"," Look at this, buyers have moved lower on hood."
"13002110","13002590"," 1211."
"13003470","13004490"," That's not good to see. "
"13005630","13007250"," We were still waiting on hood then."
"13013690","13015350"," More buyers showing up at 10 bucks."
"13015550","13016890"," We didn't have these guys earlier either. "
"13030000","13032820"," Yeah, what numbers do we need for a 20% correction?"
"13033160","13034620"," Does anybody know the exact numbers?"
"13050960","13055240"," So RTY needs $197 to hit its 20% correction."
"13056380","13059260"," Thanks, Al for chiming in with QQQ's down to 14%."
"13061480","13067260"," Yeah, we saw those $197 puts come out today on the rut. "
"13070620","13072320"," Q's are like 13% or so."
"13072520","13074520"," Yeah, Al's saying it's 14%."
"13089620","13091440"," Yeah, I'm still not ready to buy a hood then either. "
"13091900","13092920"," I'm going to wait on that one."
"13093520","13094100"," Look at XPI."
"13094800","13096440"," XPI has been destroyed, right?"
"13098400","13100300"," Just wrecking ball coming through XPI. "
"13100760","13104160"," XPI doesn't show up well on book map."
"13105720","13106500"," We'll look at it."
"13118090","13119270"," Okay, let's talk to Bob. "
"13119470","13121170"," Let's address with this with Bobcat."
"13123890","13124770"," So Bobcat."
"13128230","13136530"," You would be looking for 75,000 spy puts expiring in June. "
"13138130","13139110"," As a hedge."
"13142520","13146120"," And then you would take the market long with that protection."
"13154840","13157020"," 382 is 20%. "
"13159870","13162130"," Yeah, that's about my target 390."
"13164770","13166230"," That's where I'm at, 390."
"13178280","13180080"," Do you know what that June looks like?"
"13180300","13181680"," Looks like call hedging to me. "
"13181980","13183720"," Doesn't look like put hedging, right?"
"13183900","13184460"," Looks like hedging."
"13184880","13185940"," In case we go there."
"13189810","13191070"," We're going down, baby. "
"13194430","13195390"," Does that make sense to you?"
"13196530","13197050"," Bobcat."
"13204760","13209520"," Executive officer John Foley vowed to slash expenses at the struggling fitness company."
"13210480","13211960"," Though he's disputed reports. "
"13213920","13216500"," That it had idled its factories to save money."
"13218140","13219460"," You know, I'll tell you what, Robert."
"13221280","13223360"," I'll tell you what, that's beautiful right there. "
"13224620","13225220"," That's on."
"13226860","13228740"," What's interesting about that is."
"13230980","13232760"," There's one time they can't lie. "
"13235060","13236640"," And that's during the ER."
"13236860","13238120"," You guys all know that out there, right?"
"13239300","13240680"," I want you guys to know something."
"13240680","13247600"," Yeah, I know you're thinking Bobcat, I got your brother. "
"13248260","13249080"," I hear what you're saying."
"13251980","13255380"," But if we're going down, you're going to hedge with calls."
"13258000","13259400"," So, you know, it's funny. "
"13260140","13261520"," The PTON chief, right?"
"13262140","13264540"," Executive officer John Foley is allowed to lie."
"13266060","13267780"," He can say whatever F he wants."
"13269080","13271060"," There's only one time that he can't lie. "
"13273440","13274680"," You guys know what that is?"
"13275340","13277560"," By law, they can't lie in their earnings."
"13279660","13281720"," So, the CEO can say whatever they want."
"13282520","13284100"," They can make mistakes when they're talking publicly. "
"13284840","13286180"," They can release statements that are inaccurate."
"13287480","13291960"," But there's a one time when they can't fuck around, and that is in their guidance, right, in their"
"13291960","13292740"," ERs."
"13293320","13298920"," It's the one time every quarter or every quarter that they have to open the books and they have to"
"13298920","13299480"," tell you the truth. "
"13300180","13305680"," It's one of the most fascinating things about earning season is no matter what they've told you all"
"13305680","13308920"," year long, they have to give you the exact juice."
"13313650","13315890"," Yeah, and he's allowed to say that right now."
"13316550","13317990"," He's allowed to say it right now. "
"13318570","13321410"," Let's say he says it's bad, but it's not that bad, right?"
"13321650","13322230"," Just like you're saying?"
"13323070","13327990"," Well, when you sit in their ER, you get to actually see how bad it is."
"13329130","13329770"," That's right."
"13330990","13332670"," He cannot lie because that's fraud. "
"13334030","13335410"," That's when the fraud kicks in."
"13335870","13337970"," I bring it back to Samuel Adams once again."
"13340670","13341950"," Samuel Adams is a great one. "
"13342210","13342690"," Yeah, Peton."
"13346330","13347330"," It's a lie."
"13347470","13347750"," It's a fraud. "
"13348070","13348350"," It's bullshit."
"13352990","13353430"," Right?"
"13353790","13356150"," And he doesn't have to tell the truth until..."
"13356150","13358690"," He doesn't have to tell the truth until..."
"13362690","13366710"," Well, so you can say whatever you want publicly, right?"
"13367690","13370630"," You can't lie about shit in your ER, right?"
"13371470","13372430"," That's where it becomes fraud."
"13373770","13375570"," It's like I can be a CEO of a company. "
"13375710","13377210"," I can tell you I can say I don't know."
"13377310","13378190"," We're doing fucking great."
"13378450","13381270"," I can tell you we're making lots of money. "
"13381810","13382870"," Everything's doing wonderful."
"13385810","13391690"," But then when we get to the ER portion of our company and you're listening in to me talk about"
"13391690","13396570"," the company I only at that point do I have to come clean and say, well, you know, we didn't"
"13396570","13402930"," meet these numbers and, you know, we got a chip shortage problem and, you know, Jimmy didn't want"
"13402930","13406970"," to come into work on Tuesday and I forgot to tell you guys that."
"13407390","13411330"," Or I didn't know it was that bad until I got together with the boys with the accountants and the"
"13411330","13413570"," lawyers and all my managers. "
"13414310","13415950"," Yeah, so XPI's been beaten down."
"13416430","13418250"," This doesn't really show a lot for XPI."
"13418250","13423190"," 8, 8, 50, 90 bucks ceiling right now looks like 92, 34. "
"13431320","13437400"," Looking at some Microsoft calls January 28, 631,000 dollars."
"13438220","13439460"," 305 C."
"13441140","13441420"," That's healthy."
"13441660","13442160"," Good to see that. "
"13445450","13449090"," Looking at some spy puts January 28, 430 P."
"13451050","13452850"," 255,000 dollars."
"13462140","13463500"," Yeah, they can say whatever they want."
"13464540","13465780"," That's right, our puts are green. "
"13467520","13468300"," Or are they green?"
"13468520","13468700"," We look."
"13470620","13472780"," I haven't even looked to see if my puts are green."
"13473260","13473740"," Hey, look at that. "
"13473960","13474720"," I got green puts."
"13477440","13478260"," I've got green."
"13478600","13480560"," I've got green pizza on poops. "
"13482760","13485340"," Yeah, lying did not work out so well for Elizabeth Holmes."
"13485880","13489880"," And that's the key is that when you lie, right?"
"13489880","13492180"," Is no bueno."
"13493680","13495660"," Watching major puts come in right now. "
"13495860","13499780"," IWM puts January 28, 412,000 dollars."
"13500040","13502940"," QQQ, 200,000 dollars January 21st."
"13503440","13503820"," Poots. "
"13509760","13512700"," Yeah, that CEO should not have made that statement."
"13513660","13515760"," This is the same shit that Samuel Adams did."
"13518020","13520020"," Then you get them inside the meeting, right?"
"13520640","13527060"," Samuel Adams tried to cover up that their white cloth shit wasn't working. "
"13528620","13530220"," And they didn't tell anybody about it."
"13531380","13533340"," They downplayed how bad it was."
"13534060","13537500"," And then they went into their ER and they had to be honest about it. "
"13537840","13539220"," And they were like, we made a bad move."
"13539940","13542820"," We didn't dumped all this money into this product."
"13543520","13548320"," And we found out that when people go out to dinner or to a bar, they don't want to drink"
"13548320","13549040"," white cloths. "
"13549760","13555900"," They want to get shit face at their house on white cloths while their husbands at work or while"
"13555900","13559200"," their wife's at work, trying to make sure they're not getting fat."
"13559780","13564140"," But the moment that these people step outside the front door and they go to the nightclub, go to"
"13564140","13565220"," the bar, they go to a restaurant."
"13568300","13573120"," And once they get to that restaurant bar or whatever, they don't want to be seen drinking white"
"13573120","13573400"," cloth. "
"13574160","13576380"," So whatever the version is for Samuel Adams."
"13576760","13578900"," But they failed to tell people that before ER."
"13579520","13581640"," And they were required to tell people that in ER. "
"13581960","13585080"," So the moment they did that, a lot of investors felt misled."
"13587040","13589600"," And that'll probably happen at this ER for Peton."
"13590300","13592480"," Like I can say, we're the F he wants out there right now. "
"13592920","13594620"," I am fucking short this company."
"13595320","13597860"," They can eat a bag of balls as far as I'm concerned."
"13600980","13602460"," The white cloth assessment. "
"13603920","13605600"," And this guy's going to get caught in this."
"13606680","13608700"," This guy's going to get caught in this on a ZR."
"13609580","13611340"," Because he can't lie in a ZR. "
"13613220","13614740"," He's going to get caught in this web allies."
"13615060","13615460"," It is ER."
"13615700","13616880"," He's going to come truthful about it. "
"13618220","13620460"," He's going to tell you that things are bad in the company."
"13623140","13624660"," And the stock's going to fucking plummet."
"13625280","13630260"," So I'm holding the shit ton bag of puts for just after that ER. "
"13630760","13631820"," Because I know it's going to crater."
"13635730","13636970"," I know it's going to crater."
"13639850","13644550"," The guy is closing down his manufacturing facilities to save money. "
"13645690","13649150"," You can't close down your manufacturing facilities to save money."
"13650850","13651890"," Not like that."
"13652630","13653250"," It's Encino. "
"13656710","13657950"," AFRM is way below support."
"13658230","13659830"," Jeremy and my bring up our AFRM next."
"13660850","13663110"," And someone was mentioning it in the stream. "
"13665290","13668450"," Peton is taking a massive dump right now."
"13674680","13676720"," Because everybody knows the gig is up, right?"
"13678920","13680540"," Everybody knows the gig is up."
"13681380","13683480"," And Peton just broke below. "
"13683480","13688720"," It's daily 200 ma on the one minute chart on a daily chart."
"13688860","13690780"," One minute when a one minute chart just broke below."
"13690780","13691620"," So any kind of support. "
"13692460","13693520"," Just shit the bed."
"13697580","13698620"," Ooh, AFRM."
"13699460","13702160"," Breaking below major support, right?"
"13702360","13703400"," We said you don't want to see this. "
"13706970","13708590"," Light support at $58."
"13709150","13710470"," Light support at $56."
"13711530","13712470"," Major support. "
"13713010","13714730"," Next stop for a firm is."
"13715850","13717050"," 55-13."
"13722920","13724360"," What's going on, Damien?"
"13725520","13727000"," Look up Palantair next. "
"13732210","13734350"," You got to be kidding me on Peton."
"13736350","13738130"," Easiest short out there right now."
"13738730","13739250"," Period. "
"13745530","13747930"," Reminds me of you know what Peton reminds me of?"
"13748910","13750710"," Just like whoever was commenting about Nicola."
"13750710","13754830"," I remember when that Nicola shit started."
"13755410","13757510"," All kinds of bulls got fucked. "
"13758090","13759350"," Like straight up jacked."
"13760030","13762370"," All these retarded bulls were in Nicola."
"13763230","13767310"," I remember there was a Nicola subreddit on Reddit. "
"13768070","13772550"," And they were defending Nicola saying it wasn't fraud and it wasn't this and it wasn't that."
"13772810","13774930"," He supposedly knew the CEO and yada yada yada."
"13775450","13779810"," I remember to their red in the face that said everything was fine. "
"13781150","13783530"," So they're red in the face, right?"
"13784050","13785610"," Defending, defending, defending."
"13786930","13791930"," Then you get the real juice and you find out that it was all scam, all lies."
"13794410","13796010"," They were lying the entire time. "
"13796950","13797910"," They didn't have to tell the truth."
"13801350","13804110"," It just kept cratering and cratering and cratering."
"13805110","13809510"," Got a bull coming out there and buying Tesla January 21, 960 C."
"13811070","13813610"," Spiring today, $100,000. "
"13817430","13823970"," Someone bought some spy calls January 24th, 448 C for $89,000."
"13828800","13830400"," P L T R."
"13831940","13834640"," It's like pretty strong support down here and pound here."
"13835300","13835820"," Counter. "
"13838440","13847810"," $13.54. Then a flat 13."
"13859220","13861100"," I like the price of this stock."
"13869370","13873010"," 13.52 on P L T R."
"13876090","13878130"," Oh, we're printing those puts, baby. "
"13878530","13880350"," We are printing those P TON puts."
"13881530","13884130"," We are printing us some P TON."
"13885930","13886670"," Oh, no. "
"13887170","13888070"," Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"13888750","13890370"," We just got puts, bro."
"13890950","13893490"," We're not fucking around with spreads on P TON. "
"13894170","13897370"," We're going to short this piece of shit into the depths of hell."
"13899150","13904930"," Yeah, the truck rolling downhill in the video was the icing on the cake."
"13905430","13906570"," That shit was hilarious. "
"13910910","13913570"," Palantir, Palantar, Palantard."
"13915790","13916310"," Palantir."
"13921680","13922480"," Doing great. "
"13925950","13928170"," Yeah, Nicola was great on the way up and down, definitely."
"13930130","13932970"," So we'll look at Shopify."
"13935270","13936110"," I like them. "
"13936890","13938070"," I think they're a long time hold."
"13940730","13942090"," Bye-bye, P TON."
"13943730","13945610"," Print me some money, P TON. "
"13947130","13949990"," Print me some fat, fat, tendies."
"13952230","13952950"," No spreads."
"13955010","13955910"," Not on this one. "
"13957830","13961050"," We're going to raw dog, we're going to raw dog P TON down to 10 bucks."
"13969120","13971920"," You know, Bobcat, I can check on that for you."
"13973560","13975420"," I have, let me take a look, brother. "
"13975680","13977600"," You know what, a matter of fact, I'll look for you right now, okay?"
"13978560","13984640"," I have some software that can see how much hedging is on individual tickers."
"13986980","13988780"," Yeah, Michael, I see that, brother."
"13990280","13991920"," So what we'll do is we'll look at Shopify. "
"13993080","13995580"," Yeah, you guys know what needs a beat down."
"13995920","13998040"," We knew that Nicola needed a beating down."
"13999340","14003080"," We know that P TON has a coming at this point. "
"14004000","14007340"," After all that selling that they had, and now they come out with this bullshit."
"14008580","14011500"," Even bullish on P TON, I wasn't bullish above 10 bucks."
"14011860","14015540"," So, you know, then you get this kind of news coming out and you want to be bullish there at"
"14015540","14016000"," 30 bucks. "
"14016400","14017140"," No, thank you."
"14019300","14021000"," I went about it at 10 bucks."
"14023880","14027560"," Now with this news, definitely worth more than 10 bucks. "
"14028660","14029480"," On a good day."
"14030900","14031580"," Shutting down."
"14032220","14033600"," Your factories can't do that. "
"14034820","14038180"," Didn't anticipate that demand would go down."
"14038540","14041860"," When you say stuff like that, that's like what Sam Adams said about white claw."
"14043300","14045020"," What do you mean you didn't anticipate?"
"14046720","14049100"," You didn't anticipate the country reopening. "
"14049820","14054280"," You didn't anticipate people wanting to get out and fucking exercise outside of the house."
"14054980","14061120"," You didn't anticipate that people that were locked up for two years wanted to get outside and do"
"14061120","14062600"," something other than ride on a bicycle."
"14063800","14068120"," You didn't anticipate that some guy's going to have to go back to work and his wife's going to get"
"14068120","14072100"," a boyfriend and not need to ride the Peloton bike any longer. "
"14072100","14074940"," Oh, zing."
"14075320","14075820"," Just kidding."
"14076800","14079100"," Should have said that. "
"14084540","14089160"," Your wife is going to want to ride a Peloton at home for three years or five years."
"14089500","14090140"," What are you crazy?"
"14091360","14092080"," It's insane."
"14092280","14092340"," Oh. "
"14100860","14102320"," The frothing bear, but again."
"14111380","14116940"," Seriously, did you guys really think that you tell me there wasn't a guy in the room at Peton that"
"14116940","14119320"," didn't say to the CEO."
"14121520","14124840"," You know, people are going to want to stay locked up for the next five years. "
"14127820","14128500"," Come on."
"14130960","14132540"," Of course they had that conversation."
"14140120","14142720"," They were probably trying to design new shit, right?"
"14144400","14148100"," If I had to guess they were probably going to, they would have should have done is design something"
"14148100","14148580"," for outside. "
"14149680","14153900"," Some kind of outdoor activity teamed up, bought a, bought a bike company or something."
"14154780","14157320"," If they'd bought like a bike company, banger."
"14159360","14162520"," Watching some misfit calls come in January 28. "
"14164200","14165080"," $600,000."
"14166240","14167120"," 305 C."
"14171400","14173300"," That would have been the smart thing to do, right?"
"14173740","14175760"," The smart thing is that."
"14178200","14179060"," Hold on here. "
"14179360","14180900"," We're going to buy this dip down here in spy."
"14181780","14185860"," Like one of the one of the smart things they could have done was just open or expand their"
"14185860","14186280"," business."
"14188100","14189240"," To an outside company. "
"14189380","14190460"," Then I guess you have to look at it."
"14190680","14192320"," Let's say they're going to merge with Apple."
"14194840","14196640"," Let's say Apple wants to buy them. "
"14198260","14200240"," Do you think Apple wants to buy them at 30 bucks?"
"14201640","14203660"," Or do you think Apple would rather buy them at 10 bucks?"
"14208170","14210430"," Yeah, no lockdown in Sweden is no Peton needed."
"14215580","14216500"," That's a lot of inventory."
"14216780","14218520"," You want to have shortages in Peton bikes. "
"14218520","14223400"," You want to hear that they won't have your bike to you until next year or something."
"14226260","14227900"," Yeah, misfits a nice safe haven."
"14237530","14241350"," They should have bought like an outdoor bike company or something. "
"14242250","14243410"," Or expanded, right?"
"14244150","14250110"," Bought some kind of GPS company, rolled all that stuff into a video camera that videotapes you"
"14250110","14250970"," riding your bike."
"14250970","14254530"," When I used to mountain bike a lot, we used to, I used to wear a GoPro and I'd videotape"
"14254530","14255750"," where I was riding."
"14262590","14263930"," They could have done something like that. "
"14265130","14266270"," They didn't do any of that shit."
"14267070","14267990"," They took the money and they ran."
"14269850","14272930"," Did a bunch of cocaine, hired a bunch of hookers, whatever it is that they did. "
"14274710","14278710"," While on the face of that company, they're making it seem like they're there for you."
"14279370","14280170"," Probably what happened."
"14283650","14285290"," Nice bounce here on Shopify. "
"14290330","14292550"," A little ricochet below here at 860."
"14299290","14301550"," It's a nice, nice support down here."
"14301690","14306290"," 865, 860, 855, 850 is nice and strong right here. "
"14306330","14306870"," Good to see this."
"14307930","14309370"," More sellers than buyers currently."
"14310590","14311010"," You can look lower. "
"14312530","14313710"," Shopify is a little overvalued."
"14313910","14315230"," You can't deny it, right?"
"14316410","14317110"," It's a little suspect."
"14321800","14323920"," Not much support under here at 855. "
"14323920","14329540"," If we break through 855 here, danger will Robinson."
"14331300","14332740"," Most definitely danger."
"14339790","14346440"," This should be bottom on Shopify. "
"14350660","14353980"," I'll tell you what, the bad news came out on Shopify, man."
"14354460","14356640"," This looks like the Amazon chart."
"14357740","14359780"," A whole lot of following going on in here. "
"14360520","14363780"," A whole lot of following going on in here."
"14364620","14365920"," Very, very dangerous."
"14368920","14371560"," You're basically on established support. "
"14372580","14373560"," Right here where we are."
"14374520","14375940"," This could do some damage."
"14377080","14378220"," This is like Amazon. "
"14380040","14381480"," Some suspect of it."
"14391620","14393740"," 868, I'm looking at it right now, Shopify."
"14395620","14398700"," Yeah, you know, I'm going to tell you right now, okay?"
"14399860","14402160"," Y'all should pull up a chart of Shopify. "
"14406380","14412420"," As I'll tell you what, Shopify is looking a whole hell of a lot."
"14413780","14414200"," Like Amazon."
"14419850","14422930"," You want to talk about a fucking elevator down that it's had?"
"14424630","14426870"," How about 360 on Shopify?"
"14430130","14435970"," As I'll tell you what, there is nothing holding up Shopify right now. "
"14437630","14438110"," Nothing."
"14438950","14440150"," Who brought that one up?"
"14440390","14442390"," Thanks for saying to look at Shopify."
"14444050","14445070"," There is nothing. "
"14447630","14448930"," And I mean nothing."
"14450510","14452130"," Holding up Shopify right now."
"14454870","14455890"," See this right here?"
"14456690","14458690"," I want you to see this right here, okay?"
"14461210","14463430"," This is all that's holding up Shopify. "
"14468400","14473100"," We have more sellers currently on Shopify than buyers."
"14474740","14482940"," And there is literally nothing holding up Shopify from falling another 300 points."
"14486850","14487610"," Hilarious. "
"14489970","14492930"," I tell you what, it's very scary."
"14499970","14502810"," Yeah, I don't think we got a 360 but I'll tell you right now."
"14503290","14505270"," There ain't shit holding it up right now. "
"14508050","14509250"," There is nothing."
"14510030","14512030"," No support holding it up."
"14517280","14519500"," It's literally like blue sky is the 360. "
"14523140","14526620"," It's pretty wild, right?"
"14527140","14527400"," Amazon."
"14528600","14529520"," Same thing."
"14532340","14533420"," Oh, yeah, Joe. "
"14534660","14537080"," Joe, Joe, Shop looks like a rug pull, bro."
"14540060","14542280"," Amazon looks like a rug pull at this point, right?"
"14543480","14547320"," You guys look at the Amazon underneath at the hood of Amazon?"
"14548380","14549680"," It's super sketchy."
"14551160","14552120"," Super sketchy. "
"14552700","14554300"," Am I seeing any flow on the spa?"
"14554600","14554680"," Yeah."
"14554680","14559440"," January 21st, 440p, $60,000."
"14563340","14563880"," Yep. "
"14573160","14574360"," That's super scary."
"14576460","14578600"," Shopify is down 50% from highs."
"14579760","14581340"," IV is almost 100%. "
"14581340","14583280"," That's a scary ticker to look at right there."
"14583360","14584700"," That is no bueno, I promise you."
"14585240","14586780"," It's not a ticker you ought to be looking at. "
"14588560","14591760"," When you see black below like that, everything is black."
"14592360","14594180"," When you see blue, there's some support."
"14594880","14599280"," When you see black below like this kind of stuff right here, but darker?"
"14600300","14601180"," That's no bueno. "
"14605460","14606340"," No bueno."
"14613770","14616330"," Amazon's down 50% since November 22."
"14616830","14619910"," Dude, if you look at that, you guys want to bring up Amazon and show you something scary?"
"14620770","14621570"," I'll show you something scary. "
"14626170","14627170"," I'll show you something different."
"14630900","14636720"," You could blow across Shopify and it would dump another 300 points overnight."
"14639200","14654150"," I'm going to"
"14659940","14661880"," show you some scary shit. "
"14662160","14663260"," I'll show you some scary shit."
"14669900","14671500"," We were looking at this last night."
"14671580","14673340"," I think Jason brought this up last night. "
"14683460","14684320"," We just second here."
"14684900","14686800"," This is an interesting trade that just came out."
"14687780","14688300"," Excuse me. "
"14688540","14692300"," So I am bullish here on this ticker."
"14693160","14694000"," AA."
"14696680","14698880"," February 18, 60c. "
"14700360","14702000"," $340,000."
"14702760","14706060"," Now I'm mostly interested in this trade."
"14706700","14710000"," They had a good ER, but it's an aluminum trade. "
"14713720","14717240"," They had some deals with the Russians."
"14718500","14719980"," But I would take a look at AA."
"14720260","14721260"," They had a great earnings. "
"14721880","14725520"," We've got the, Russia is one of the biggest producers of aluminum out there."
"14725760","14726600"," Suppliers of aluminum."
"14728160","14729520"," But I like that AA trade. "
"14731840","14734140"," January or February 18, 60c."
"14735460","14736420"," $340,000."
"14737660","14738480"," I like it. "
"14740860","14742120"," Guys, you guys ready for this?"
"14744800","14746320"," I'm going to see some under the hood stuff."
"14748060","14749080"," See this down here?"
"14750140","14751660"," See how that white goes away?"
"14751880","14753060"," That blue light blue goes away."
"14757500","14758340"," See down here?"
"14759200","14759880"," How does it get down here?"
"14763740","14765500"," Nice big fat red bar at 2,800. "
"14776760","14778940"," Clear skies down at 2,735."
"14780700","14782160"," This is nothing."
"14782760","14785440"," Just so you know. "
"14792430","14794150"," You can look on the right-hand side here."
"14794270","14795310"," See where the real buyers are?"
"14796130","14797370"," Not quite there yet."
"14798050","14799950"," See we're not quite there yet with big buyers?"
"14800830","14802070"," It's all black in here. "
"14807230","14808490"," I'm going to show you where the real buyers are."
"14809570","14810030"," We're right here."
"14812530","14815430"," See how on the right-hand side here you see this change?"
"14818670","14821770"," This is where the real money is on Amazon. "
"14823570","14824010"," 2600."
"14825870","14833060"," I didn't trade in this market any day."
"14833280","14833620"," Me too. "
"14837090","14837730"," Hey, Mero."
"14838050","14838430"," How's it going?"
"14839390","14842010"," Yeah, so under the hood, shopify real low."
"14842190","14843090"," Amazon under the hood. "
"14844090","14845510"," You can see it on the right-hand side here."
"14845590","14846670"," This is where the banks are."
"14847970","14849350"," So 2600 on Amazon. "
"14850350","14855670"," I'm not saying we trade there, but that would hurt the market."
"14857490","14862150"," Some spy calls just came in January 26th."
"14862650","14866730"," 452C for $263,000. "
"14867210","14874930"," More spy calls January 26th, 452C for $137,000."
"14880550","14881570"," Mero, how you doing, brother?"
"14882490","14883150"," Hope all is well."
"14887500","14888360"," You making money?"
"14889760","14891680"," Mero, you've been doing well out there in the market?"
"14910900","14912600"," Shopify is just knocking at the door. "
"14920650","14926650"," I guess if you're Uber bullish, you would buy Shopify here, right?"
"14926650","14934510"," Oh, yeah, I'm still in my PTON puts."
"14934970","14937670"," I'm going to diamond-hand those things right into ER."
"14941790","14943270"," Okay, actual question. "
"14943570","14943870"," Hotch."
"14944530","14945250"," Capx question."
"14945550","14948350"," I'm holding 440P on spy zero dates. "
"14949150","14950470"," What could happen at 3PM?"
"14952210","14955490"," What should I expect if I think we go down right at 3PM?"
"14958290","14959230"," Let's see here."
"14960330","14962110"," Do I have short-dated PTON puts?"
"14962790","14963430"," I've got them."
"14963730","14965150"," You still live, Mero?"
"14965590","14966110"," Right on, brother. "
"14968870","14970150"," My PTON puts."
"14971110","14976770"," I just picked up new puts for what day?"
"14976930","14977150"," Let me look."
"14980550","14991300"," February 11th, 20P, because I'm"
"14991300","14994720"," betting that they're going to go to their ER and they're going to tell you that they really fucked"
"14994720","14995320"," up bad. "
"15004850","15006430"," What do I think is going to happen at 3PM?"
"15007850","15010110"," I'm going to give it a few minutes."
"15010290","15010930"," I'll give you my predictions."
"15013170","15014690"," What do I predict is going to happen?"
"15014690","15024050"," I think that we have a fair chance of trading"
"15024050","15038470"," down to 435 until around"
"15038470","15047150"," 3.45PM. You see short-covering come in and we rip higher into the bell. "
"15052520","15060670"," I think on Monday, Tuesday, we might have a Vanirale, but it's not going to happen."
"15060670","15062090"," It's not going to be the kind that you're expecting."
"15063030","15068110"," I don't think that it's a Vanirale that brings us all-time highs. "
"15074820","15083940"," Or we keep trading sideways and down into the Fed meeting and if the Fed says"
"15083940","15092020"," you're only getting three to five interest rate hikes, we'll call it a day."
"15092520","15097220"," If the Fed says we're getting five to seven interest rate hikes, good night ladies."
"15100120","15101300"," I don't need that. "
"15102100","15102500"," What's that?"
"15103520","15104240"," Hold on one second, guys."
"15128500","15130060"," There's a couple different options on the table."
"15130940","15134000"," I'm in some calls right now into the close, so I've got some cheap-ass calls. "
"15134280","15139460"," I guess if you're better asking how to trade it, right where we are right now at this moment,"
"15139660","15140480"," heading into 3PM."
"15141080","15141960"," How do you trade this?"
"15141960","15142880"," It's easy."
"15143800","15144800"," It's super easy. "
"15146240","15147100"," Let's take a look."
"15154540","15156220"," We can easily trade this into the close."
"15158200","15166260"," If you don't want to hold anything over the weekend, I would say buy yourself some"
"15166260","15176090"," 440Ps and buy yourself some"
"15176090","15178370"," 445Cs and you just straddle it. "
"15179190","15180270"," You could do it today."
"15180430","15181170"," You could do it into Monday."
"15183950","15190350"," If we start selling down, you're only going to lose $0.10. You'll make two bucks. "
"15191830","15193690"," You could turn them into 435Ps."
"15194450","15196010"," Those are only $0.13 right now."
"15196010","15205870"," You have 435Ps for $0.12 and 445Cs"
"15208400","15213380"," for $0.25. That makes it almost a $0.40 trade. "
"15215920","15222160"," If you're feeling like they're not going to park it into close, one side of that should print."
"15223460","15226060"," I think it's a $0.38 trade in both sides."
"15226780","15228780"," It's $0.08 on both sides, hitting in close. "
"15232840","15235180"," You're going to expect some action in the last hour."
"15237740","15238980"," Trade that easily, right?"
"15239720","15242260"," You're really going to trade down to 435 or 445."
"15243100","15252250"," Unless they park it, there are a lot of trades out there that they want to park"
"15252250","15253490"," into the close. "
"15253990","15255270"," That's the one fear, right?"
"15255850","15261870"," They want to keep certain trades right into the bell and pin the market if they can."
"15265600","15272740"," The only thing that I'm in right now is I'm in some cheap-ass spy calls and I'm in some"
"15272740","15275520"," piton puts, expiring after their earnings report."
"15276080","15277140"," That's all I'm in right now. "
"15284110","15285770"," Look at the keys right now for you."
"15289950","15290470"," Yep."
"15294200","15295760"," Yeah, I like the one-time hike. "
"15300310","15303190"," Yeah, Winkyface, if they do some shit like that, right?"
"15303850","15310010"," I think John and John and John and I were talking yesterday about John and I yesterday were talking"
"15310010","15315970"," about if that happens that the banks will just wind up pricing it in."
"15317750","15319650"," The banks will say, you know what?"
"15322630","15324850"," We've got a lot of spy puts coming in right now."
"15324990","15325590"," Heads up out there. "
"15326230","15333290"," Apple puts coming in February 4th, 162.5 P, 270,000 dollars."

"15335930","15336130"," Okay, guys. "
"15336890","15345090"," We've got a QQQ's January 21, 353 puts spy, 441 puts, expiring today."

"15381860","15387420"," PNC August 19, 195 P for 2.2 million dollars. "
"15388080","15391500"," That actually makes me bullish on PNC just as it heads up."
"15414410","15415870"," Yeah, Winky, I agree with you."
"15415870","15422430"," Joe and I were talking about that exact thing that if the Fed fucks around with this shit, the Fed"
"15422430","15428070"," fucking dances and tells you one thing, but they're doing something else that the banks might not"
"15428070","15431130"," want to be put in that same situation again. "
"15431730","15433470"," So the banks will just force their hand."
"15433470","15437790"," If the Fed says we're not priced in seven rate hikes, then they'll just do it themselves to the"
"15437790","15438050"," market."
"15440670","15444010"," So they don't get caught with their pants down and blow up their banks again this time around. "
"15448370","15449430"," We're heading down, boys."
"15455370","15458330"," Price target, 435.14 right now."

"15503880","15506160"," 434, 434, 27."
"15506560","15508880"," Buyers have actually moved down from previous."
"15510000","15510840"," Maybe not. "
"15511240","15511480"," 435."
"15512440","15513280"," I can be wrong on that one."
"15513660","15514860"," Could have been an adjustment on the screen. "
"15515740","15520700"," Still sitting at 435.08. More spy puts coming into the front door."
"15521260","15522820"," January 21, 440 P."

"15541370","15542870"," For January 21. "
"15554280","15555660"," Beers are loading the boat."
"15555820","15558020"," I'm watching it live in the options chain right now."
"15558100","15561700"," It's not popping up on the flow algo. "
"15562240","15569080"," But under the surface right now, there is a stealth buying of spy puts currently 440 P."
"15569380","15570840"," They're loading the fucking boat."
"15571440","15576360"," Further on flow algo at this point, what's coming up is more January 21, 440 P."

"15620560","15621520"," All broken up."
"15621660","15623240"," Could be retail traders not sure yet."
"15633450","15634810"," This is not a good sign. "
"15635010","15635790"," This could be good or bad."
"15636050","15638270"," I want you guys to pay attention to what just happened here."
"15638850","15641690"," You see support is now disappeared down below at 435. "
"15642470","15647090"," I want to see if the buyers are stepping in right now."
"15647150","15647930"," It looks like they have."
"15652770","15658690"," We triggered right at three o'clock where we've gone from we're up now to 975,000. "
"15659030","15666330"," Excuse me, 9.75 million buyers to only 910 sellers."
"15667510","15670190"," Looks like the buyers might have swooped above from 335."
"15671590","15676170"," We're going to take a look down below real quick into the surface and see what happened to those"
"15676170","15677030"," buyers down below. "
"15682440","15684620"," You can see now we're targeting 430."
"15687260","15687980"," Fucking a."
"15716410","15718530"," Just a word of warning to you out there."
"15720630","15722410"," There is a rug pull at 435. "
"15722410","15731210"," I can't tell you if the buyers have swooped up to meet here at that 439 level."
"15732130","15734530"," If they have not, we're going to watch this closely here."
"15735350","15741690"," If you see this big red bar up here, stay larger than this little red bar down below here, right?"
"15741830","15743490"," So I just see this got real deep, deep dark red. "
"15744050","15746610"," This end ends up turning into like yellow or white."
"15749070","15753550"," You could see a hundred point drop or something crazy into this close."
"15757270","15758790"," Down to 430 flat. "
"15761770","15763610"," Very dangerous right now out there guys."
"15774310","15776390"," There are puts and there are hedges."
"15777350","15781230"," There's put flow and there's put hedge flow two different things. "
"15782010","15783590"," They do different things."

"15793550","15795990"," We're going down boys and we're not fighting. "
"15829060","15834920"," And the buyers that there was that there were buyers down here at 435 and they just straight pulled"
"15834920","15835640"," that rug out."
"15836580","15838840"," They have now moved lower down to 430."
"15842620","15846320"," Be warned out there if you're be warned out there if you're a bull right now. "
"15846320","15850080"," They've actually moved even lower than 430 or no they're still there."
"15850340","15851760"," Having some screen adjustments here."
"15852060","15858820"," Buyers removed themselves and went lower to 430, 430, 2024. "
"15872880","15873820"," Worn all your friends."
"15880810","15883430"," Could see a major bloodbath here boys and girls."
"15884270","15885190"," Major bloodbath. "
"15893810","15895290"," Not 50 handles."
"15896110","15896750"," Hundred."
"15898650","15899690"," Hundred handles. "
"15906490","15908490"," Things to get real ugly here."

"15953050","15956490"," 440 peas now up to $1.90 for a moment there."
"15968820","15970380"," Take this as a warning out there."
"15971240","15972780"," They did rug pull at 435. "
"15974960","15982760"," They came back in again here at 1506."
"15984920","15986740"," But this is still a light bid."
"15987560","15989860"," There was a big giant red bar down here at 435. "
"15990460","15994920"," They removed their bid into the market and they lowered their bid to 430."
"16001980","16004620"," Looks like they split the bid halfway at this point."
"16005760","16007520"," Between 430 and 435. "
"16010660","16013560"," If you're a bull, watch the fuck out."
"16018940","16020340"," Thank you so much."
"16021760","16022720"," That looks delicious. "
"16024860","16025820"," Made with love."

"16188060","16189740"," Bulls just start disappearing."
"16191620","16193900"," Fade into the shadows like the bears used to do. "
"16194560","16196640"," But what about this and what about that, right?"
"16196860","16197100"," For years."
"16198960","16202180"," Bulls, I mean, bears would just, you know, fade away and disappear."

"17533580","17536280"," It really is stacked up against the bulls here. "
"17537140","17542420"," You don't want to see this kind of flow into the clothes of the markets on this Friday."
"17543100","17548180"," You don't want to see all this call delta rolling off the markets on a Friday."
"17552600","17554820"," All right, so you have more stuff coming through here. "
"17554820","17560740"," Spy calls, January 21, 438 C for $100,000."
"17561280","17562040"," Plug."
"17562420","17563940"," Remember we talked about plug this weekend?"
"17564880","17566320"," Plug January 28. "
"17566980","17568320"," It has a high algo score."
"17569180","17572780"," January 28, 23 C for $42,000."
"17573960","17575740"," IWM is finally caught a bid. "
"17576900","17583780"," January 28, 350, excuse me, 204 C for $200,000."
"17584640","17590220"," QQQ's January 24, 355 C for $171,000."
"17590660","17597980"," VIX puts VXX, not VIX, 128, 20 P for $67,000. "
"17599160","17603200"," We're starting to see some spy calls at this point, a little rack of spy calls."
"17604380","17607880"," January 28, 439 C for half million."
"17607880","17613140"," January 28, 439 C for $2.5 million. "
"17613980","17619200"," January 28, 439 C for $1,000,000."
"17621460","17627360"," Also spy calls January 21, 440 C for $250,000."
"17629100","17634220"," More QQ's puts coming in January 24, 348 P."
"17635120","17636160"," Marvel calls. "
"17636860","17638760"," Somebody was asking about Marvel earlier today."
"17639320","17645960"," MRVL, January 28, 80 C, $39,000 has a high algo score."
"17646300","17647220"," I would agree with that one. "
"17647560","17651700"," We were saying earlier, we were looking at Marvel and we said, you need to look for a call"
"17651700","17654560"," structure on Marvel to take it long."
"17655720","17658320"," Otherwise, market conditions can send it much lower."
"17658320","17667640"," So if you remember who is talking about Marvel earlier, let them know that $39,000 and 80 C's came"
"17667640","17668860"," in for January 28. "
"17669560","17679500"," We have some VIX puts coming in again, VXX, January 28, 216 P, SNAP puts coming in still, still"
"17679500","17680620"," rolling in SNAP puts."
"17682120","17686800"," June 17, 35 P for $580,000."
"17687120","17689860"," Again, that makes me bullish on SNAP at this point. "
"17690380","17693080"," That looks like I had to protect going long on SNAP."
"17702180","17703120"," Yeah, thanks all."
"17703300","17704160"," Thank you all you guys. "

"17753720","17757560"," Call Delta expiring could be worse for IWM of all three indexes. "
"17757840","17758640"," Good point, day run."
"17761440","17762660"," No worries, Josh."
"17764720","17766880"," Matt, like button. "
"17767100","17767580"," Hells, yeah."
"17767580","17770480"," How does all the calls rolling out the market effect prices on Monday?"
"17771260","17771960"," You're welcome."
"17772320","17773460"," Thank you very much, Taehasi. "
"17774100","17775580"," Is it Taehasi?"
"17776400","17776900"," Thank you, brother."
"17779140","17782200"," Yeah, I've got a list coming downstairs here in just a minute."
"17782360","17787680"," I've got someone working on the list of people that tipped through directly instead of PayPal, so I"
"17787680","17789540"," can meet all of your names off here this afternoon. "
"17790560","17791480"," Thank you, Casey."
"17793360","17796980"," So what is the plan here heading into the closed, boys and girls, right, is the question?"
"17796980","17798860"," Ooh."
"17799460","17800420"," Viacom. "
"17801100","17804620"," April 14th, 35C."
"17805160","17807580"," A million dollar bet."
"17808480","17808800"," Whoo!"
"17809640","17810480"," Hello, bulls. "
"17811620","17812420"," Viacom."
"17813120","17815600"," April 14th, 35C."
"17816820","17817540"," IWM. "
"17818920","17821010"," It's light calls coming in January 26th."
"17822900","17823180"," 200C."
"17826520","17828320"," 183,000 dollars. "
"17831000","17835700"," Spy puts coming in January 24th, 430P."
"17836360","17837900"," 564,000 dollars."
"17838460","17842100"," I think the safe way that you play this is you play it with a, with a straddle. "
"17842580","17844080"," I think that's the only thing you can do."
"17844780","17851760"," Or if you want to play this bullish, you put yourself a putback spread on cost nothing."
"17853860","17854840"," 400, right?"
"17855080","17857640"," I want you to know that we are setting up right now. "
"17858420","17859800"," We are in our bear town."
"17860020","17861220"," We are not in bull country."
"17861480","17862880"," We're in bear town, bear country. "
"17863480","17864960"," We are selling reps right now."
"17865600","17867700"," We are setting up to have a losing week."
"17869620","17871820"," Then we're going to be setting up a losing month. "
"17873780","17876200"," You set up two losing months in a quarter."
"17876460","17877260"," That's a bad quarter."
"17878900","17882160"," If you set up a bad quarter, that's a market crash. "
"17882320","17883600"," We're going to head into a year of down."
"17884540","17887320"," Be conscious on a larger grander scale where we are."
"17889680","17891160"," And let's say you want to get bullish. "
"17891520","17894300"," You can get bullish, but you need to have protection if you do it."
"17895660","17897660"," For the things that you don't think are going to happen."
"17898080","17899340"," We looked at Shopify earlier. "
"17899820","17902120"," It's like it's just ready to drop."
"17902720","17906020"," If Shopify drops another 200, 300 points were fucked, right?"
"17906020","17908040"," Amazon, same problem."
"17908740","17912180"," No support where it currently sits down to 3,600. "
"17912940","17914720"," There's some real scary stuff out there."
"17915280","17921400"," You have Apple that has split four times in the last two years, or a four-way split within two"
"17921400","17921740"," years."
"17922880","17925080"," Trading at 600 and some dollars, right?"
"17925500","17925940"," $670. "
"17928300","17932480"," Two years later, even though there's a split, I believe that price does matter."
"17933260","17937240"," People will try to buy it at 90 bucks, but to think that it hasn't been pumped up is insane."
"17938940","17941020"," We know that the government's trying to reduce inflation. "
"17941700","17944180"," If they do that, you have to reprice stocks."
"17945160","17947340"," Bulls don't feel comfortable buying here."
"17950080","17956160"," If spy calls coming in January 21, 439C, small money though, 78 grand, not a big mover. "
"17956680","17961520"," IWM, May 20th, 200C, $588,000."
"17961520","17962620"," That's a fair bet."
"17963000","17964220"," I don't mind that bet. "
"17964900","17967820"," We could trade back to 200 in that time period."
"17967820","17968580"," It's possible."
"17969280","17969900"," It's on the table. "
"17970820","17972760"," It's possible a small swing higher."
"17974180","17975980"," Tessa bull stepped in just now."
"17976520","17980140"," Spent his last $39,000 on 965C. "
"17981300","17983380"," I bet that's that guy's last 39 grand."
"17983600","17984200"," He's like, fuck it."
"17984760","17986040"," Goin' balls deep on Tessa. "
"17986380","17986660"," Let it ride."
"17988380","17991200"," Spent $39,000 on January 21."
"17992920","17994240"," 965C, diamond hands baby. "
"18001240","18003960"," A little bit of snapback here on spy heading into the close."
"18006880","18008060"," A little bit of squeeze."
"18009480","18011140"," Talked about this squeeze earlier today. "
"18012020","18015060"," So we'll trade down to 435 and swing up and squeeze it up into the close."
"18024960","18026740"," Got some hood puts coming in earlier."
"18027040","18031060"," We took a look at hood and we said shit, all the buyers swooped down below the 10 bucks. "
"18031060","18034700"," They kind of scattered from that $12, $13 price tag."
"18035280","18036900"," And someone just bought some hood puts."
"18037860","18041760"," February 18, 10 P for $23,000. "
"18042880","18046440"," That makes sense if you look at the book map on it."
"18053760","18056940"," Peton's like Will Ferrell from that movie."
"18057360","18059500"," Old school is like on the rings. "
"18059900","18063300"," He's got cigarette in his mouth smoking a cigarette trying to hold himself up here in the bell"
"18063300","18063600"," again."
"18065760","18070380"," Like a drunken sailor walking down by the war, afraid to fall off the edge of the fucking dock."
"18071560","18077340"," Got some spy calls coming in January 21, 440C, $90,000. "
"18077660","18078840"," I'm going to try to park this, aren't they?"
"18079940","18085760"," Now we see hood calls coming in, 12813C for $59,000."
"18086520","18088360"," I'm going to go with hood trading down to 10 bucks."
"18089020","18090100"," I'm going to go against that trade. "
"18091840","18100420"," Spy January 28, 444C for 230 or $273,000."
"18100660","18101420"," Nvidia calls."
"18101620","18103180"," This looks like retail stuff. "
"18103740","18105060"," All of this looks like retail bulls."
"18106040","18110940"," Nvidia January 28, 250C, $136,000."
"18111640","18116200"," Hood January 28, 13C, $60,000. "
"18117200","18120160"," A lot more hood calls than puts coming in right now."
"18120500","18122420"," We'll take one more look again at head maybe."
"18122760","18123940"," Did it trade down to 10 bucks?"
"18124120","18124760"," I missed that part. "
"18125200","18126320"," Maybe I missed something on hood."
"18128920","18133720"," Because to me, what I was looking, wasn't looking good for hood."
"18135380","18138200"," We had buyers prior to it, like 13 bucks. "
"18138860","18140060"," And they moved down to 12 something."
"18140940","18142880"," And then earlier today they moved down to $10."
"18143700","18147500"," So we're going to see if they've stepped up at this point or if they're still down there. "
"18150200","18151580"," Yeah, see they're still down there."
"18152100","18153400"," This is a fool's errand right here."
"18154420","18155860"," These guys weren't here before. "
"18156200","18158820"," They've moved from 12 bucks down to 10."
"18159560","18165760"," So if you want to follow that hood play, if it sells down to 10 bucks, grab those calls."
"18169280","18171100"," Yeah, they're still down there, 10 bucks now. "
"18171600","18180460"," All right, here we go."
"18183020","18192640"," GSK, Gamma, Sierra, Kilo, GSK, January 21st, 42C"
"18192640","18194640"," for $400,000."
"18195200","18195660"," That's pretty good. "
"18196880","18197820"," I like that trade."
"18203420","18212080"," H-I-M-X February 18th, 15C, $80,000 has a high algo score."
"18214660","18220260"," Pen gaming, January 28th, 42C, $69,000. "
"18226480","18231360"," Still have 15 minutes left to see what people are going to do here."
"18231360","18235320"," I also have the 15 minutes after the bell to watch the indexes today as well."
"18235760","18238740"," Let me know in the chat where you guys think we're going next week. "
"18239260","18249060"," Do you think that we're going to trade up on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday?"
"18249560","18254860"," Do you think we're going to trade down Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday?"
"18255440","18260620"," It really would like to see more calls right now in the market than what I'm seeing right now."
"18262860","18271040"," The other question you have to ask yourself is, does a longtime call holder exercise for shares or"
"18271040","18272740"," do they take the money and run?"
"18274820","18276880"," Overwhelming puts coming in right now."
"18280200","18282880"," Dealers no longer having to hedge those calls. "
"18283920","18286680"," It spells trouble in my view."
"18301430","18303010"," Let's see what you guys are thinking we're going to do."
"18319540","18321280"," Jason did the straddle off the opening range. "
"18321300","18322900"," Yeah, the straddle is the play for sure."
"18324600","18325660"," Do you think we get the bounce?"
"18326400","18327940"," I don't disagree with the bounce."
"18330840","18336100"," I mean, even when we mark itself, even when we liquidate, we typically get a bounce. "
"18339600","18343700"," Sing some more IWM puts January 24th, 195."
"18348780","18350600"," Yeah, margin calls go out at 330."
"18352200","18356800"," And the other thing too, the other thing that you can think about is diamond hands, baby. "
"18360080","18365780"," What you can do is you can take, you could take, let's say, some calls are so cheap heading into"
"18365780","18366220"," this bell."
"18368380","18369420"," How do you trade that?"
"18369580","18374740"," You could trade it like, you could buy a bunch of dirt cheap calls for Monday or Wednesday."
"18376040","18376480"," Right?"
"18376800","18377080"," Dirt cheap. "
"18379240","18382300"," And then you just buy some put spreads expiring in a few weeks."
"18383860","18389280"," So if we have that snapback trade that comes up, you'll make money on the call side."
"18391300","18394580"," You'll still collect the money on the backside for those put spreads. "
"18397640","18403860"," If we don't get the snapback up on Monday, or if we don't get the snapback trade on Monday, at"
"18403860","18407960"," least you'll pay for those cheap ass calls with your put spreads that I'll be printing."
"18413040","18415220"," That might be my trade into this bell right here."
"18415420","18416660"," I'm going to set something up here. "
"18426240","18428600"," So four, four, I'm going to set up a trade right now."
"18432580","18434860"," My trade is going to be."
"18438460","18440080"," So February 18th, right?"
"18444710","18447030"," That's for all the money's at February 18th. "
"18452020","18454660"," All the puttages on February 18th."

"19574220","19575360"," Right around here."
"19576300","19581960"," That would set up your second month in this quarter that we are down red."
"19583340","19586400"," The implications of that are that we have a bad quarter. "
"19587320","19588480"," We would shift."
"19589180","19594340"," If we end up having a bad quarter we would shift from trying to set a bottom let's say for"
"19594340","19594760"," the market."
"19595500","19598100"," Say you're like hey we'll hopefully we get down to like 400 or something. "
"19598860","19607240"," And you would start to target below and you'd move away from a correction into some pretty nasty"
"19607240","19607660"," territory."
"19608680","19610100"," You'd be targeting 390."
"19612520","19620180"," You'd go from having three bad months to having six to 12 months that are bad. "
"19626660","19627480"," Real bad."
"19631610","19632950"," Bad quarter would set up 390."

"19642190","19643770"," We looked at it the other day buddy of mine and I."
"19645690","19647330"," Joe Joe Donut and I were looking at it."
"19647370","19652350"," We didn't want to show it probably because I don't want to scare anybody out there because it"
"19652350","19653470"," hasn't been confirmed yet."
"19653630","19655470"," You need certain things to happen to confirm it. "
"19656750","19663030"," But if we were to trade down to 419 and then pin it into the end of the month of"
"19663030","19668670"," February that is not a good look into March and the end of the quarter."
"19672010","19683850"," It's 409 p.m. Yeah"
"19683850","19688430"," I'm happy right now but I don't like yeah I want to see it go down but even though I"

"19740750","19742270"," robot that picked up on something. "
"19742750","19745230"," So I kind of have to do some stuff to make sure that doesn't happen again."
"19746370","19753710"," But if it ever does happen in the future you can always fall back to the website or the discord"
"19753710","19757870"," both are in the description down below if I have to sign up for a new."

"19768330","19769850"," This is a great market to make money in. "
"19770450","19771990"," It was outstanding to make money in."
"19773190","19775950"," It was a beautiful thing you could buy it to call whenever it had printed."
"19776730","19777790"," Hey everybody made money. "
