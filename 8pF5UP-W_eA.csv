"277420","280400"," And we'll talk, do some talk in this one."
"280500","284860"," I think we might have a few guests on one or two or possibly three guests on this morning."
"285540","287200"," Spoke to some people yesterday. "
"288160","289240"," I'm not sure on that yet."
"289300","290820"," So bear with me."
"290820","295040"," Let me do one more mic check here because I got some weirdness going out way. "
"295340","296020"," That's better."
"296240","296860"," No, that's better."
"297240","298160"," I like it better like that. "
"298600","298800"," Okay."
"300800","306560"," Now we are parked right now at the gamma bar at four six."
"306600","306800"," I'm remaining. "
"307380","309220"," I'll lead with the EIA crude oil inventory."
"309980","313680"," Five zero trying to break above it to forty seven hundred."
"314280","319520"," Unless we unless we trade underneath the hourly trigger, the trend is up. "
"319520","321040"," Whether you know that or not, I don't know."
"321680","324160"," Came up here last night and blasted."
"324300","326600"," Remember this PT three that we had here yesterday?"
"327460","329360"," So we did that this morning, right?"
"329580","330240"," Blasted up here. "
"330320","333620"," Got our PT two yesterday and then the overnight and this morning."
"333960","338740"," Went up and tagged our PT three ish kind of, kind of sort of."
"339260","340360"," What does that mean?"
"340860","341240"," Right?"
"341640","347340"," That means that if we can stay and get above here, we're going to start to attack some pretty big"
"347340","348520"," targets to the upside. "
"348980","351000"," Well, we'll take a look at those today."
"351000","352780"," Like where can some of those targets be?"
"353620","355620"," How fast the market can move here?"
"355780","359760"," If it's up or down, are we looking for liquidity to the upside?"
"360620","363160"," There's a lot of there's a lot of kind of where it does."
"363300","366880"," We get closer to four seven five zero four eight zero. "
"366900","367580"," The closer we get."
"369200","370600"," What is the end result?"
"370860","371840"," There's no call walls."
"371840","373380"," That's four seven zero zero zero. "
"373380","375500"," Four spot two five nine million."
"375500","379540"," That's lower than the expected draw of one spot eight million gasoline inventories."
"379540","381780"," A build of zero spot four zero nine million. "
"382000","384020"," Build zero spot four zero nine million."
"384400","387240"," It is lower than the expected build of one spot nine million."
"387620","392160"," Just a little bit trees a build of one spot four nine four million one spot four nine four million,"
"392160","397160"," which is larger than the expected draw of zero spots and one nine three million. "
"397160","401780"," A crude cushing inventory is a build of one spot two to eight million build of one spot two to"
"401780","402320"," eight million."
"402820","407580"," Some strength in WTI crude or following EI inventories a larger than expected storage draw."
"412600","416000"," Thanks for the birthday wishes to my daughter. "
"416220","420140"," My oldest sir birthday this morning and I'm a little sad."
"420520","421140"," I'll be honest with you."
"422240","425380"," I don't want to lose there and I'm going to lose there and. "
"426200","430080"," Are my wife and I we spent our lives."
"430880","432460"," We spent our lives."
"433600","435040"," Involved in our kids lives. "
"436260","441740"," And that's not the case for everybody or everybody's experience growing up but it's kind of sad,"
"441740","441980"," man."
"442180","443720"," I'll be honest, you know."
"445280","451480"," Whoever whoever she meets in her life adult life but friends and experiences and all that stuff. "
"451480","455840"," They're going to have an awesome experience whether because it's been nothing but a joy from our"
"455840","456100"," end."
"456240","457880"," Nothing but a joy with my oldest daughter."
"457880","466060"," I'm telling you, it's like this is the child that is like wants to explore everything. "
"466680","467740"," Learn new things."
"468320","471020"," No matter what you do and she wants to do with you."
"471780","473140"," If I said to her, let's go. "
"473280","473720"," Let's go like."
"473840","476360"," Let's go hike the Appalachian Trail should do it by said to her."
"476420","477500"," Let's go surfing right now. "
"477520","478080"," She'd do it."
"480380","482260"," She's like the coolest kid in the entire world."
"486560","487980"," All right, hold up. "
"488140","489140"," We'll see what we got going on here."
"489480","490080"," That's all done."
"493410","496090"," I'll switch over to spy really quick down here. "
"497110","498890"," Okay, you got some some levels."
"499130","502450"," This is what we looked at yesterday at this bottom chart just below me."
"503310","505410"," Talked about this yesterday, right?"
"505690","509450"," We're targeting this area here and we've already tagged it. "
"509450","512330"," And then we're looking above it to the next level."
"512789","514789"," Today, I put this on a 15 minute chart here."
"518440","521520"," If we can grind above every single switch over here. "
"522320","529040"," A 15 minute chart that I showed you yesterday for some expectations and look what we did."
"529500","529800"," I'm up here."
"530540","531280"," Slammed up here. "
"531800","536460"," Coming back up to this previous pivot in pre-market looking for that 465 75."
"537620","539060"," If we can park it above here."
"539060","546920"," We can possibly open the door into Friday to 47 47 for 70. "
"548020","549600"," So we'll look for that as well."
"550920","552100"," Long as we're above."
"552500","560240"," We know that unless we break below the hourly trigger, which is right down at 463 34. "
"561100","562540"," That the trend is up."
"562540","567140"," So, well, as long as we keep training, as long as that price actually keeps doing this, we'll trade"
"567140","570340"," it all the way up into whatever those highs are."
"574000","576100"," Let me, I got to put some levels in for you this morning. "
"576280","579560"," Make sure that you guys got your targets to the upside for the day."
"580480","581820"," Can we just one quick second here?"
"620770","621570"," There's our one."
"621570","622810"," It's been a CNBC interview. "
"623110","626890"," US Treasury Secretary Yellen says turbulence in the job market has really settled down."
"627190","628710"," No significant uptick in layoffs."
"644040","645860"," Think tech as opposed to that for you. "
"648080","649260"," The newest treasure."
"649480","651780"," Protect your trade from macro headline risk."
"652120","653880"," Stop going down. "
"654220","656960"," So here's the yellow speaker right now."
"656960","659480"," It changes in the way people live and work."
"660660","662240"," During the pandemic. "
"662500","669740"," And I think it gave rise to a pre pressures on real estate prices, both rentals and house prices"
"669740","670380"," went up."
"671400","673880"," So, you know, young people who are."
"675380","680300"," Spired to own a home who are renting their senior monthly rent. "
"680300","683920"," Go up all the new rental prices of stabilized."
"684720","687240"," If you're in the middle of a rental contract."
"687720","688960"," Big boy up here. "
"689160","694300"," You're likely to see the rent and just up to current market levels."
"694780","695900"," And that's a big expense."
"696300","697080"," And people. "
"697620","697760"," Yeah."
"698220","698420"," Yeah."
"698620","700560"," Young people are hoarding five five. "
"700700","703400"," And some important prices."
"703400","706660"," But gas prices are now way down."
"707220","716080"," A number of states where it's a gallon is running at under three dollars a gallon, which is great"
"716080","717320"," news for consumers. "
"718140","720400"," We saw it prices are really skyrocket."
"721220","723280"," Mainly because of the avian flu."
"723740","728680"," They've come down back toward pre pandemic levels. "
"729660","731260"," But, you know, still."
"731260","731940"," Elevated."
"732180","732480"," Yes. "
"732620","736060"," So, when do you think the federal achieve its two percent inflation target?"
"736060","737020"," When does that happen?"
"737500","742060"," Well, my expectation is that inflation will continue to come down."
"742520","748520"," And I would, frankly, expect I don't want to do a precise forecast here for you."
"748840","752500"," But I think when we come to the end of 2024. "
"752800","758560"," Two is certainly, you know, likely to be the first, the first numeral."
"758560","763100"," And, you know, I think we're getting a lot, a lot closer."
"763520","767980"," How likely is it that the soft landing continues into 2024?"
"768800","772240"," Because we got it in 2023, but there are risks on the horizon. "
"774940","778160"," So, I think there's a reasonable chance we get it."
"778360","779880"," I think that we're on that path."
"780200","785100"," My baseline is that we'll achieve a soft landing. "
"785940","786840"," Are there risks?"
"787340","788320"," Of course, there are risks."
"788840","789320"," Great."
"789400","789920"," Douglas of her. "
"790140","796920"," We could experience another global shock that could be unsettling to that path that could drill"
"796920","801820"," inflation upwards or have adverse effects on the economy."
"802760","807880"," Monetary policy is an art and not exactly a science."
"807880","815040"," And it requires skill and a good dose of luck to get that exactly right. "
"815040","819520"," I think there's a baseline with solid probability."
"820260","821720"," We're in the path for soft landing."
"822140","822440"," So no recession. "
"822830","823340"," That's good."
"823700","825500"," What's the recession risk at this point?"
"826320","828640"," Well, I believe in any year."
"829020","836160"," Even if you knew nothing about the economy, there's a recession risk that's over 10%. "
"836160","838900"," So there is always some recession risk."
"839540","841680"," I don't think it's particularly high."
"841680","845980"," Consumer spending we've seen remains solid. "
"847180","854580"," Consumers built up a buffer stock of saving and wealth during the pandemic."
"855180","858460"," They've been spending that down gradually."
"859480","860820"," That stock is eroding. "
"861860","869600"," But as long as it's coming back to more normal levels and as that happens, I expect to see the"
"869600","878460"," pace of consumer spending slow somewhat, but probably to a more normal level that's consistent with"
"878460","881740"," trend-like growth, which is what I expect."
"882200","889400"," I mean, another quarter like the third quarter, I don't expect growth at that pace, but we've got"
"889400","894220"," more people coming into the labor force, adult labor force participation."
"895080","897720"," It's at the highest level in several decades. "
"898980","901540"," The economy can handle that."
"902000","908480"," It keeps growth solid incomes moving up that support consumer spending."
"909080","911900"," I think the baseline here is very good. "
"912540","915320"," And of course, there are always risks, but they're not outsized."
"915580","921140"," Would the Fed cutting interest rates help preserve that soft landing next year?"
"921140","924520"," I'm not going to give the Fed advice on what they need to do."
"925920","932540"," I'm very happy with the outcomes we've seen in the economy over the last year or so, and I'm going"
"932540","936120"," to trust them to make good calls. "
"936940","938200"," Okay, I'll ask you another way."
"938560","943140"," The market is expecting a number of Fed cuts next year, and it's been very excited about that."
"943440","945800"," It has loosened financial conditions quite a bit. "
"946400","950400"," Does that improve the outlook and does it risk inflation flaring back up?"
"951220","960240"," Well, both things are possible, and I think the Fed has to think about what path of financial"
"960240","968260"," conditions they regard as consistent with keeping the economy on a soft landing path."
"968660","970300"," Right here, boys and girls."
"970380","972980"," I want to see inflation continue to move down. "
"973160","974640"," That's the one right there."
"974840","979380"," It's in a way natural that interest rates should come down somewhat."
"979380","981200"," Four sixty seven thirteen. "
"981720","984240"," That is the high from spy."
"984380","987120"," Which can tend to tighten financial conditions."
"987120","990580"," January of twenty twenty two pretty close. "
"992380","995320"," Pretty close inflation doesn't come down."
"995800","998060"," The line is the target right here."
"998300","999180"," Just a heads up. "
"999340","1007120"," And the other is that the economy becomes too weak, and I'm going to leave that call to them."
"1007120","1009000"," On a Fed day, no left."
"1009680","1014360"," The other thing that the market's been paying a lot of attention to lately in your wheelhouses is"
"1014360","1018380"," treasury auctions, which is something we haven't been paying as much attention to in recent years,"
"1018380","1021240"," but now are watching because we've had some wobbly ones. "
"1022240","1024119"," Have you been focused on this?"
"1024680","1031500"," Well, I work regularly with our team that manages treasury debt and treasury auctions."
"1031500","1040040"," I meet regularly with the treasury borrowing advisory committee, which is a group of mainly private"
"1040040","1046900"," sector advisors who help us understand what's happening in the treasury market."
"1047380","1049140"," We always seek their advice. "
"1049900","1057420"," You know, the cornerstone of treasury policy when it comes to debt is regular and predictable"
"1057420","1058140"," issuance."
"1059140","1061720"," We issue across the curve."
"1062200","1066400"," We give forward guidance in order not to surprise markets. "
"1067280","1072100"," The objective is over time to achieve the lowest."
"1073260","1074740"," Play out with me."
"1074840","1076620"," For the federal government. "
"1077240","1082840"," And that also involves keeping treasury markets liquid and well functioning."
"1083680","1085360"," And the adjustment."
"1085820","1087560"," We did make an adjustment too. "
"1087980","1096140"," We've had to step up issuance to finance ongoing definite deficits and to refinance maturing"
"1096140","1097040"," securities."
"1097600","1104160"," And in view of some stresses we had seen in the long end of the curve."
"1104520","1109000"," He's a mean one from Mr. Stepping up issuance. "
"1109040","1116980"," We're stepping it up at essentially all maturity levels, but we chose to do a little bit less at"
"1116980","1124720"," the long end, given our understanding of the demand in markets and pressures that exist."
"1125500","1130420"," Are investors right to be nervous about demand with all of this issuance set for next year?"
"1131300","1140260"," You know, I think that it's not, it's our job to keep fiscal policy on a sustainable path."
"1140880","1149260"," And as long as we do that, I don't think there's any reason for investors to feel nervous about"
"1149260","1149740"," issuance. "
"1150700","1151500"," And I think."
"1151620","1152120"," Are we doing that?"
"1152320","1153660"," Are we on a sustainable path here?"
"1153660","1159800"," Of a six percent deficit during a high growth and co-employment kind of picture?"
"1160200","1167060"," Well, the president has signed legislation that brings deficits over 10 years down by a trillion"
"1167060","1167820"," dollars."
"1168160","1177280"," We have a huge tax gap that means taxes that are owed, that we're not collecting owing to"
"1177280","1182960"," shortfalls of personnel at the internal revenue service. "
"1183560","1186440"," We've achieved funding to boost that."
"1187080","1191960"," We see greater tax, greater tax revenues ahead."
"1192780","1199700"," And the president has made further proposals over the next 10 years to cut two and a half trillion"
"1199700","1204600"," dollars over 10 years from the deficit path. "
"1204600","1207340"," So we do have a fiscal challenge."
"1208240","1213460"," Our interest costs have not yet significantly risen."
"1214760","1224640"," We expect, we've always expected that average interest rates, borrowing costs, would rise somewhat"
"1224640","1230100"," over time as we moved out of a period of exceptionally low rates. "
"1230100","1238000"," Now, if the interest rate environment remains very much higher than was expected, we'll have a"
"1238000","1246980"," slightly tougher job to control deficits, but the president stands ready to work with Congress to"
"1246980","1249660"," take the actions that are needed to do it."
"1250220","1256280"," And the president's made proposals in his last budget, and we have another one that we're working"
"1256280","1262140"," on now, both to boost tax revenues back toward more normal levels."
"1262400","1269340"," I think part of the problem with our deficits, it's not that discretionary spending is very high as"
"1269340","1270180"," a share of GDP. "
"1270780","1272860"," It's actually fallen substantially."
"1274120","1284120"," But rather the tax revenues after the Jobs Cuts and Tax Act of 2017 fell to"
"1284120","1286300"," very low levels."
"1286680","1287560"," She's victory-walking. "

"1325820","1327880"," So I don't know what else to do here."
"1327980","1331120"," At this point, I've got both sides covered. "
"1331120","1332940"," If we swing high, I'll close up calls."
"1333860","1337640"," I'll close out the upside of my edge."
"1337640","1341360"," And then if we swing low, I'll close those out. "
"1341420","1344000"," Basically, straddling everything here."
"1344120","1346680"," Wherever we go up or down, it doesn't really matter to me at this point."

"1361060","1362800"," And we're going to go to 470."
"1363140","1366440"," We could squeeze to 470, 475, 480, really fast."
"1366440","1368600"," And then make an immediate reversal to the downside. "
"1369140","1373160"," But we have some changes this morning that I want to discuss with you here in just a moment."

"2201350","2205910"," Let's just say fucking we trade 4750 or 4700, 4800. "
"2206070","2210750"," Do we still get dragged back down to the whole of death into the end of year?"
"2211430","2216350"," Or does Jerome Powell do something today that sends us lower to trade that into end of year?"
"2217070","2218030"," It's on my mind."
"2218190","2219330"," I'm not going to lie to you."
"2219510","2225070"," It's not not scared of it or anything, but I know that it's going to drag us. "
"2225490","2226970"," It's like a tractor beam, man."
"2227910","2230270"," So maybe we'll talk about that at some point today as well."
"2230270","2237090"," We'll take a look at the collar and its impact and traders trading to it and all that kind of"
"2237090","2237290"," stuff. "
"2240400","2240880"," Yeah."
"2241880","2243160"," Not the only one though."
"2243440","2244340"," That's funny. "
"2244540","2249600"," Trader podcast is in stream and in the chat on Twitter."
"2249680","2250420"," It doesn't matter."
"2251580","2252760"," I've got people everywhere. "
"2253220","2257040"," Like, well, it looks like we blew by your 4515 target."
"2257040","2257920"," I'm like, wait a minute."
"2257980","2261400"," I told you it doesn't matter if price is below or above. "
"2262440","2263620"," It'll magnetize regardless."
"2264380","2265540"," And they're like, you didn't say that."
"2265600","2267220"," I'm like, oh, man, you just read what you want to read. "
"2267340","2268000"," I'm like, that's okay."
"2269200","2278680"," But not you, trader podcast, but I'm fascinated by it heading into end of year to see how close we"
"2278680","2279340"," get to it."
"2279500","2283280"," And if we get, as a matter of fact, if we don't come back to it, it'd be a very"
"2283280","2284320"," rare occurrence, right?"
"2285160","2288480"," And if we don't come back to end of year, it'll be very rare, rare occurrence. "
"2288480","2291960"," It's usually really fast heading into that target."
"2291960","2294520"," It's like, we're just zipping there."
"2295260","2300500"," And if we don't, it would be a, even if we don't, it's very rare occurrence, right?"
"2300900","2310400"," It's like one out of, we see here, maybe one out of 10 times, but it probably higher. "
"2310520","2316320"," It's probably one out of 20-ish times that we don't actually get sucked into it."
"2317240","2319360"," So it'll be really fascinating regardless."
"2319980","2325720"," It's probably the biggest thing of the quarter for me to see if we run into it or not. "
"2326240","2328880"," And there's a lot of people in the fence on that one this year, this quarter."
"2329560","2333220"," There's a lot of people in the fence saying, nah, that thing's not going to matter."
"2333540","2336040"," So then you're not the only one saying that either, trader podcast. "
"2336660","2343540"," And I get the, I understand the reasoning too, the mechanical reasons why we shouldn't."
"2344760","2352080"," I was thinking about, you know, I was thinking about after our conversation was, which one, hold on"
"2352080","2353680"," a second, let's take a look at which one I was thinking about."
"2355980","2363090"," So I was looking at, uh, a C."
"2368440","2373360"," I was thinking about, uh, shoot, have I already done this?"
"2373540","2374840"," You guys already see this from me?"
"2376680","2379220"," Which one was I thinking about this one right here?"
"2381060","2383300"," This is like the special one right here. "
"2386450","2387790"," Let me see if I can show it to you."
"2390430","2393750"," Uh, this, this one right here is always the one that fascinates me."
"2394210","2399930"," This is back from, uh, March into June of 2022. "
"2399950","2402510"," And it's like we're just raining down here."
"2403550","2405670"," And, uh, just a full reversal."
"2406610","2408610"," Right up into end of quarter. "
"2409030","2410410"," It's like stuff like this."
"2411950","2414210"," That has me concerned."
"2414790","2416670"," This is the, I believe this was the 17th. "
"2418010","2422070"," Uh, I believe the date on that was the, let's check the date on that one."
"2422370","2424550"," This was the 17th right here."
"2424870","2430830"," And I recall, I recall this, um, this was the 16th. "
"2431450","2435650"," So the 17th is when the reversal came in."
"2436430","2437410"," Reversal to the upside."
"2437910","2442950"," So not if that matters seasonally, we should, we should have a Santa rally or a holiday rally,"
"2443150","2443950"," whatever you want to call it. "
"2444370","2445730"," Uh, best of us for the rest of us."
"2445830","2448450"," But this one right here, this, this bad little boy right here."
"2449310","2451350"," Uh, you know, it's like we're going to crash. "
"2451410","2453170"," We're going to crash and."
"2454290","2457650"," Two days later, the narrative leaves and we're up here again."
"2458310","2464030"," And it's just like, we close slightly lower than it, but you see the magnet into it. "
"2464530","2465770"," Still counts, right?"
"2466290","2469670"," So, uh, this, well, let's find out what date that was."
"2474950","2477250"," So this was, I guess we, right here."
"2477370","2479430"," So this was the 28th right here. "
"2480290","2483530"," Um, you got the high bar and the low bar over here."
"2483530","2485050"," So I'm fascinated by it."
"2485450","2489050"," Like 29th of, I think it's 29th is the last day for the trade here here. "
"2489350","2493130"," That's the one that's, um, that's the one that's got me going here."
"2493230","2493470"," So."
"2493470","2497570"," And looking at this one right here. "
"2499330","2502210"," My question is, do we get the, you know, the blast up?"
"2502770","2505210"," And then right into the 29th."
"2505270","2506650"," It's like way I'm right down in here."
"2507170","2507870"," Uh, a little J pow. "
"2507870","2508910"," I guess if he really got."
"2509690","2512830"," Pockish possibly could send us down and we'll trade back up that way."
"2514090","2518850"," But either way, I'm fascinated by heading into, uh, end of, into the end of the year. "
"2519090","2521290"," Find out that if we do magnet back down into this."
"2521870","2523270"," Uh, 45, one, five."
"2541320","2541760"," Yeah. "
"2541920","2547900"," The one, the one good thing would be the one good thing would be, um, I would like the run"
"2547900","2548360"," better."
"2549460","2554040"," If we have like the, if we had the suppress day, a little bit of down heading into the weekend."
"2554040","2563820"," And then we make that run up into, uh, the collar and we trade 47, 50, 48, whatever, 5 "
"2563820","2565740",",000 in January, March. "
"2566500","2567040"," I like that."
"2567280","2570840"," I like it because I think it, I think it cools shit down a little bit."
"2572080","2573560"," Uh, but I am fascinated. "
"2574040","2581260"," I have one, I have one experience where we were getting a rate cut and we we squeeze straight"
"2581260","2588960"," vertical and we, it was just a liquidity grab to front run, um, a back check on the market and"
"2588960","2589840"," it was pretty wild."
"2589840","2591680"," It was like straight vertical green bars."
"2592040","2593360"," I'll try to find it today. "
"2593780","2596040"," This morning, I'll try to find it for you and shit."
"2596180","2601260"," We have one previous experience of just straight vertical and then we grab the liquidity and it was"
"2601260","2603340"," just south, south, south, south."
"2603620","2609500"," It was like two or three months of selling, uh, slow selling, slow staircase down and, uh,"
"2609900","2611440"," eventually that led to rate cuts. "
"2612020","2615840"," Uh, it was like a two or three month out, it was like a two to three month out, uh,"
"2616060","2621060"," front running of eventual rate cuts that came, of course, like, I was like three or four months"
"2621060","2625140"," later, we started getting cuts and then, uh, they kept cutting and cutting and cutting the process"
"2625140","2625820"," took about a year."
"2630510","2634010"," Uh, you want a nice touch of the daily trigger?"
"2634350","2635350"," I can understand that too."
"2635350","2640810"," Um, you know, even, even saying that though, if you, if we tag the daily trigger, you want it to"
"2640810","2642550"," still get above the hourly trigger. "
"2642550","2644310"," You want that consolidation to take place."
"2645550","2647110"," Hourly trigger has been pretty good."
"2647170","2648230"," And so it's going to fail. "
"2648810","2653330"," Let's take a look at the, you want to look at the 30 minute chart possibly and just, uh, let's"
"2653330","2655570"," take a peek at spy and find out."
"2657010","2660090"," What it's looking like on its, um, velocity."
"2661710","2663210"," Neutral on 15 minutes. "
"2665610","2668270"," Declining on the 30 declining highs on the hourly."
"2669870","2674170"," Declining highs on the daily kind of neutral right now, uh, to not bullish."
"2674990","2676390"," Although we can fix that. "
"2676510","2681750"," The one key point here would be, uh, when we are up here in this max, uh, bullishness and the"
"2681750","2684430"," daily, we can have sustained upside price movement."
"2685490","2691710"," And, uh, we know for sure this morning, um, we know for sure this morning, that, uh, people are"
"2691710","2694010"," rolling puts and calls there."
"2694130","2700670"," So you've got people out there rolling to higher highs and, uh, rolling out puts now, uh, to"
"2700670","2702790"," farther out dates and higher strikes. "
"2703430","2708550"," Uh, it's showing up inside of the data coming out of SPX this more, or leave this morning."
"2708550","2708870"," So."
"2712900","2717360"," I, uh, I'm going to see if I can pull up this example in the past this morning. "
"2717440","2718600"," I'll try to work on it in the background."
"2718820","2719640"," I'm going to show you guys."
"2720440","2724760"," Um, I'm going to show you guys, uh, a."
"2726720","2730520"," That it like, can we squeeze just absurdly and go up?"
"2730700","2731100"," It's possible. "
"2731340","2731980"," We've done it before."
"2732660","2735940"," Um, so I wouldn't discount it."
"2736680","2738580"," Uh, I'll say that. "
"2738660","2739460"," I wouldn't discount it."
"2739560","2739700"," And."
"2740560","2746860"," There is a thesis to be made for, uh, five, five stuff, five thousand and believe it or not, six"
"2746860","2747360"," thousand. "
"2747920","2752540"," Uh, I don't know if that happens, but if it were to happen, man, it would be brutal."
"2753120","2755800"," It would be fucking brutal if we went, went and did all that."
"2758670","2760630"," And just close the door and 3500. "
"2760810","2761290"," It would be insane."
"2772700","2775720"," Go through the chat this morning and read what some of you guys are saying here."
"2775740","2776580"," I'm just bringing in the chat. "
"2776720","2778080"," This is why I've read a little bit of not much."
"2778400","2778940"," More in Andre."
"2779740","2780520"," Good morning, Jared. "
"2784840","2786920"," Joe Brown, traffic trades, what's going on?"
"2787060","2791260"," If you're just joining us right now, a heads up that the chats are open."
"2792000","2796420"," If you're on YouTube, uh, you can just click the button, subscribe."
"2796880","2797180"," It's free. "
"2797620","2799320"," And then you're, you have the ability to chat."
"2799760","2802520"," If you're on Twitch, you can chat this morning as well."
"2802520","2805080"," If you're just joining us normally, we close the chat. "
"2805540","2812760"," Uh, due to Russian sex bots and, uh, we sometimes will get hit runs when the chat markets at, uh,"
"2813260","2816180"," peak exuberance or peak panic."
"2816560","2820700"," So normally we close the chat so we don't get overrun with, um, counter alpha."
"2822280","2829440"," Please be respectful in the chat all day long today because, uh, we will mute you if you don't try"
"2829440","2834560"," to provide, um, uh, try to provide true alpha, not counter alpha. "
"2835180","2836660"," Try not to go off any diatribes."
"2836960","2838980"," If you're angry, that kind of stuff, you'll get muted."
"2839200","2840240"," I don't want to mute anybody today. "
"2840240","2844000"," I want you guys to have an enjoyable day with us, uh, on the stream."
"2844780","2848360"," Uh, we'll talk about, uh, the expected moves on the day today."
"2848540","2849760"," Anyways, back to that chat thing. "
"2849980","2850880"," Just try to be cool today."
"2851060","2856920"," If you got, if you're a moderator here, make sure that you're watching for, um, us at any point,"
"2856940","2860660"," get being overrun by people that are in the, uh, on YouTube and Twitch."
"2861260","2866220"," I want to see the, um, I don't want to stop in at the, at the, um, very emotional moments"
"2866220","2867440"," of the day. "
"2867840","2869340"," Uh, what else we got for you today?"
"2869340","2872960"," And then we're going to review the, uh, expected moves on the day."
"2873260","2875360"," We're going to go over what happens on fed days."
"2875960","2882060"," Uh, typically we'll, um, we'll not trade those expected moves and then the reprice, then we'll, uh,"
"2882280","2886340"," then blast through them and miss the next one and then reprice. "
"2886900","2889160"," And you'll get a bigger move a day or two later."
"2889340","2890980"," The real move in the market a day or two later."
"2891520","2894680"," Uh, yeah. "
"2894780","2895760"," I hope you sign up for any subscriptions."
"2896500","2900200"," We saw the idea here is, uh, we're launching a website, I believe on Friday."
"2901080","2902280"," Uh, there are different tiers. "
"2903120","2908600"," Uh, so we've run a, we've run, um, we've run, uh, everything we've done has been free to this"
"2908600","2908960"," point."
"2909640","2914640"," Uh, and we are going to maintain, uh, forever."
"2915540","2919860"," As long as it's last, as long as we're doing last, they'll always be that free version. "
"2920300","2924040"," So you'll always get a live stream, uh, for free."
"2924560","2929700"," You'll always get, uh, you'll always get, uh, those daily levels that I give to you that you'll"
"2929700","2930880"," always get those for free."
"2931220","2934520"," And matter of fact, we're going to automate them now with charts and all that kind of stuff. "
"2935140","2937000"," Uh, for free."
"2937340","2941980"," And then the only thing that, uh, you'll be charged for is the discord access."
"2942160","2943360"," Uh, I believe it's 10. "
"2943580","2945740"," So if you want to chat and go to discord, it's 10 bucks."
"2946160","2947980"," So let's start levels zero or whatever."
"2948360","2951720"," You're always, levels zero, you're always going to get access to the, uh, you're always going to"
"2951720","2954600"," get access to the stream and the levels every day. "
"2954940","2959080"," The other thing you're going to get, uh, access to free ish is the discord."
"2959560","2965220"," Now we have a problem with discord because we're a financial, um, uh, retail community."
"2965480","2968640"," We attract, uh, scammers, bots, you name it. "
"2968880","2970180"," Uh, we, we attract in the discord."
"2970340","2974520"," So, uh, we have to close that discord to that threat."
"2975020","2980060"," That's five bucks plus the, uh, five for chatting, uh, cross YouTube and Twitch. "
"2980360","2981980"," So you got, uh, zero dollars."
"2982500","2985060"," You've got, uh, an ability to, you get zero dollars."
"2985240","2990520"," Then if you want, you can just pay the $5 to chat on, um, uh, YouTube. "
"2990860","2994100"," If you like, I don't want to pay five bucks to chat, but chat on YouTube."
"2994540","2999200"," You can chat for free on Twitch as long as you subscribe through, uh, Amazon prime gaming."
"2999460","3002840"," So it's just one more step to keep the scammers and the bots away from our chats. "
"3003580","3005740"," See, it's $5 level at 10 bucks."
"3006200","3007500"," You get, uh, $10."
"3007720","3014780"," You get, uh, access to, uh, discord and you get, uh, the ability to chat across both platforms. "
"3015400","3017040"," Uh, then we have another level above that."
"3017040","3024540"," And that's, uh, we're hoping to be like, get my fingers crossed right now that we can, um, launch a"
"3024540","3027340"," level where we have, uh, the tools for you on the website."
"3028000","3030000"," Uh, that's very approachable in price. "
"3030000","3034640"," And then we've got, uh, um, a version of the tool that you can just carry with you."
"3034640","3037140"," If you don't want to get, if you just like, I don't want to be on the website."
"3037240","3038620"," I want to be the disc where I just want the tool. "
"3038820","3040140"," You can have access to that."
"3040500","3044440"," So we're trying to, uh, build that up for you right now and launch that stuff on Friday."
"3047180","3049780"," Uh, we've got educational videos. "
"3049980","3053940"," They recorded multiple, multiple hours of educational videos."
"3054420","3057980"," Uh, Pinky's working on them, editing them right now, packaging them all up."
"3057980","3059960"," Now those will all be available to you too. "
"3060300","3061000"," It's going to be really cool."
"3061380","3062520"," Uh, we're doing a ton of work."
"3062600","3065020"," I'm working on a bunch of other stuff that's not quite ready yet. "
"3065300","3072300"," Uh, scanners and, uh, paper trading simulators and options, profit calculators, gamma Gex models"
"3072300","3076860"," coming out, all kinds of cool shit will be added, uh, as time progresses."
"3077800","3079160"," Uh, as that stuff is all fully developed."
"3079760","3081820"," Uh, so we're just trying to make the idea here. "
"3081900","3086180"," The idea here is that, uh, we're, we've completed what we wanted to do."
"3086180","3088800"," What we set out to do, we, we, we won."
"3089400","3092640"," And, uh, we've got this kickass core group of retail traders. "
"3092700","3099380"," And now we want it to be sustainable and, uh, to make it sustainable, it has to be some, some,"
"3099620","3105480"," or end, and the demand for some form of data and development and all this other stuff from people."
"3105780","3111120"," Uh, that want to support the community and keep the community, um, going for many or more years to"
"3111120","3111320"," come."
"3111540","3114940"," So, uh, I want to say thanks to all those people out there that have supported us to get us"
"3114940","3115080"," here. "
"3115080","3120540"," And I also want to thank, specifically thank the people that want to, um, make sure that the admins"
"3120540","3122820"," stay and the moderators stay and the teachers stay."

"3129180","3133720"," inside those streams, the people inside the discord, uh, the developers that work in the background"
"3133720","3134700"," for us and all other stuff."
"3134840","3137380"," So it should be kind of cool to see where this goes. "
"3137800","3142940"," If it doesn't work, if it's like, uh, there's no demand, nobody wants this, then we'll just shut it"
"3142940","3147780"," down and go back to what we were doing, uh, many years ago where it's like, you know, 10 or"
"3147780","3148940"," 100 of us or something like that."
"3149080","3152480"," We'll just, we'll just fuck around every day and hang out, uh, privately."
"3153140","3154840"," So that's where we're at right now with that. "

"3504040","3504960"," Sammy, good to see you."
"3505840","3506980"," You guys want me to look at Apple?"
"3507220","3507440"," All right."
"3507520","3507700"," All right. "
"3507720","3509320"," You guys, we're screaming Apple all more."
"3509400","3509620"," Let's do."
"3509720","3510260"," Let's do Apple. "
"3511640","3513480"," Just bloody, bloody screaming on Apple."
"3513600","3514000"," Let's take a look."
"3518500","3519940"," Apple, Apple, Apple. "
"3521300","3521680"," Okay."
"3521820","3522680"," Let's check out Apple."
"3523080","3524940"," That's like 10 people asking about Apple. "
"3525720","3527080"," Seems pretty legit, right?"
"3528720","3529820"," Seems pretty legit."
"3531720","3532740"," One minute trigger."
"3534600","3537180"," We got a big old cross going on over here, right?"
"3539780","3540260"," Nice. "
"3540480","3541840"," What do we call this right here?"
"3541940","3543040"," You guys know what this is, right?"
"3543380","3545920"," One, two, three, four trigger cluster with a back test."
"3549020","3550760"," That's the big boy right there, right?"
"3551240","3551740"," Squeeze up."
"3552980","3554300"," Back test is successful. "
"3555220","3557820"," Back test on the hourly is successful."
"3558260","3559980"," You got the cross happening right up here."
"3559980","3560940"," And what do we do?"
"3561300","3562380"," Just start launching, right?"
"3562880","3563580"," Start launching. "
"3563980","3565160"," What do we do when that happens?"
"3565240","3569080"," We're always looking for successful back tests of that squeeze."
"3569640","3572580"," We have one right here on the half hour trigger."
"3572880","3575340"," Another deep one right here on the half hour trigger. "
"3576040","3578200"," So we're going to look for that right now, right?"
"3578380","3579480"," We've got this half hour trigger."
"3579660","3580180"," There's your springboard."
"3581820","3589760"," So as long as we back test, 194, 97, 194, 51, we should continue to head higher. "
"3590700","3593240"," Let's look on the 30 minute chart and see where we are here."
"3594620","3597860"," We've got some nice, we've got a nice, another pump going on in the daily."
"3598160","3601440"," We've got a little bit, a little long in the tooth and the hourly in the 30 minute chart. "
"3602120","3603940"," So expecting a little bit more pullback here."
"3605800","3610900"," Though I will say if price is above, let's go back to this one minute chart really quick."
"3613500","3616560"," Give you a little, some little places of interest here. "
"3617340","3619500"," You're looking to buy a dip down here."
"3619620","3620120"," It's right here."
"3620300","3623940"," You've got one right there and you've got another one right down here. "
"3624220","3629060"," So you can start building a long position, right?"
"3629300","3631440"," If we come back down, right?"
"3631820","3634200"," Start building a long position, comes down on you."
"3634460","3635860"," Second one, here's your stops."
"3636780","3641080"," Remember, if we go through your stops, there's usually a capitulation trade. "
"3641720","3643440"," That's where your stops actually are as above."
"3644300","3645040"," You know about that."
"3645720","3647180"," What else do we have here?"
"3647640","3648440"," I think that's it. "
"3648880","3650780"," I think that's it."
"3650880","3651540"," Where's the target?"
"3651900","3653140"," We know where the target is, right?"
"3653660","3654060"," It's 200."
"3655180","3658220"," We know that target is 200. "
"3659600","3660680"," Way up here."
"3665320","3666820"," Right up there is the target."
"3668620","3670300"," Just keep on plugging away. "
"3670640","3676300"," If you do see a break at any point, if we have a pullback down here and you see a"
"3676300","3682060"," failure of that hourly trigger, that's fine, but you're then looking for any kind of rejection."
"3682200","3687240"," If that begins to happen with the hourly trigger, you're going to get quite bearish on this."
"3687560","3688860"," You're downside target. "
"3689360","3693940"," If we do break trend on Apple is quite slow."
"3694180","3697060"," It's 188.63 down here."
"3697180","3703040"," 188.63. So just be careful because if they have a bloodbath that's down, get underneath. "
"3703880","3705300"," We will likely trade that."
"3705300","3710280"," We'll have some tags down here, some previous lows and stuff, but that would be the target to the"
"3710280","3711740"," downside on Apple."
"3712740","3715280"," So right now, just looking for a pullback to buy a dip. "
"3715980","3718560"," Anyone that bought this dip back down here, congratulations."
"3719300","3720240"," You're just parked and waiting."
"3721240","3723300"," There's a bear cross happening right now. "
"3723340","3724480"," You guys know what a bear plane is?"
"3725120","3727700"," We get this little cross right down here."
"3728640","3730560"," See that nice little cross taking place."
"3733360","3734380"," Right here. "
"3739150","3745830"," You know, you're looking for that blood pull up and then just straight down into that half hour and"
"3745830","3746730"," hourly trigger."
"3746910","3748370"," That's Apple for you this morning."
"3754850","3756270"," Come back over to spy. "
"3759460","3761860"," Just knocking on the roof of 465."
"3764700","3765780"," There's our two."
"3766240","3767640"," I'm going to bring that over there for you. "
"3772540","3773340"," Is David A."
"3773420","3773440"," M."
"3773580","3773580"," S."
"3773960","3774880"," See sleeping this morning."
"3775020","3776620"," I should call David to see if he's here this morning."
"3781120","3782660"," I looked at Apple for you, Sammy. "
"3782820","3783260"," That was done."
"3783820","3784420"," What else?"
"3784880","3785520"," Oh, right on."
"3785660","3785920"," Right on. "
"3787700","3789320"," Tell me I said a little too, short press trader."
"3789760","3790380"," What's going on, John?"
"3790600","3790900"," How are you?"
"3791120","3791660"," Tim, good morning."
"3792900","3793440"," Shum Daddy. "
"3793640","3794060"," What's going on?"
"3794860","3795060"," What up?"
"3799040","3800720"," John, how are you saying hello as well?"
"3801040","3802020"," Back to short press trader."
"3803500","3804280"," Jack Baker."

"3809280","3810080"," Show Tesla."
"3811660","3812480"," What's going on?"
"3812540","3812720"," Okay. "
"3812960","3813780"," What else we got going on here?"
"3814440","3815280"," Oh, zero."
"3815780","3816520"," What's going on, brother?"
"3818740","3819860"," Dave G is front row."
"3820000","3820960"," Alpine for fish brother. "
"3821280","3821560"," I do."
"3821820","3823620"," So fish is playing in Vegas, right?"
"3824440","3824820"," Is that real?"
"3825020","3826240"," That fish is playing in Vegas."
"3835310","3836030"," Thanks, Casper. "

"3842060","3843320"," Peeps know if I get a chance."
"3843520","3844940"," I just said Apple for you, Sam. "
"3847760","3849740"," These tickers are all running together, aren't they?"
"3855620","3856660"," Year end recap."
"3856880","3858260"," I just looked up my recap for the year."
"3859080","3860400"," It's been a great fucking year, man. "
"3860500","3861360"," I want to thank all you guys."
"3861660","3864500"," We did the number of unique visitors and watchers this year."
"3865160","3870120"," I think on YouTube, we had 350 or 60,000 unique viewers. "
"3871460","3872840"," I haven't looked at Twitch yet."
"3873180","3875240"," The stats for this year for it's been amazing."
"3878040","3879460"," Insane stats this year. "
"3879560","3882040"," So thanks and congratulations to all of you out there."
"3884160","3886060"," I'm going to look at BTC too."
"3887220","3897040"," We were talking last night, talking to Quinn last night about having a dedicated crypto. "
"3900820","3904340"," Like a just what we do is or what we and what we do."
"3904460","3907340"," You know, we're talking about last night with crypto as we're saying."
"3907920","3916440"," I was saying, you know, I really like to focus on crypto, but it attracts so much noise. "
"3918840","3922900"," How do we how do we not attract the noise but attract the real crypto track?"
"3923840","3928040"," There's like, there's like an underground, very crypto bros."
"3928100","3928600"," Probably know this."
"3929260","3933840"," There's an underground crypto community that's no one covers. "
"3935840","3937160"," Very small communities."
"3937940","3939080"," So we're talking about that."
"3939240","3945260"," How do we like tap into those communities and cover those trades for those people. "
"3947520","3951120"," So we're discussing that late night last night and hoping we can do that."
"3951620","3953660"," Now you want to take a look at BTC really quick and snow."
"3954420","3955860"," We'll look at both of those really quick. "
"3956040","3957440"," Let's take a look at BTC and snow."
"3961680","3963300"," This is the triggers."
"3964100","3964780"," We'll check out BTC. "
"3965860","3968220"," We had a little conversation about BTC earlier this week."
"3968220","3972760"," We talked about bounce on Bitcoin."
"3974560","3975840"," On the daily trigger. "
"3976040","3981800"," We talked about this earlier in the week, if you recall, to not expect this to break."
"3982540","3982700"," Okay."
"3983580","3984600"," It's 30 minutes. "
"3984680","3985420"," You can see it better."
"3987340","3988420"," Let's talk about this."
"3988700","3990460"," I think we've made a post about this. "
"3991360","3993000"," People were like, oh, crypto's crashing."
"3993100","3993700"," It's burning."
"3994160","3994860"," BTC's burning. "
"3995060","3995540"," It's gonna be terrible."
"3996140","3999060"," We're like, yeah, I'd be looking for a dip by down here."
"3999400","3999860"," We got one. "
"4000020","4000420"," We got two."
"4000540","4000900"," We got three."
"4001000","4001420"," We got four. "
"4001940","4004800"," We're now above the hourly trigger currently."
"4005220","4007120"," Now I want to be clear with you."
"4007200","4007340"," Okay. "
"4009500","4016240"," You are going to be looking for number one, a three hour look back on Bitcoin or any ticker."
"4017020","4018280"," Three hour look back."
"4020940","4022180"," This is very bullish. "
"4023960","4029420"," You get your squeeze, then you're getting your cross right now of the half hour and hourly trigger."
"4030460","4034660"," But what you want really, if you're a bull, is for a touch back."
"4035400","4035560"," Okay. "
"4036700","4039640"," On any squeeze, a touch back that's successful."
"4040560","4043220"," And that actually leads to much higher prices."
"4043860","4048560"," So these initial squeezes I never like. "
"4049220","4053820"," And the higher they go, the less sustainable they are."
"4054020","4055840"," So it's a pretty big squeeze right here."
"4056300","4058280"," We're coming into the first resistance point. "
"4058680","4061380"," You've got another resistance point and you've got some higher."
"4062700","4069460"," But if it can come back down and check and have a successful check, we should have an explosive"
"4069460","4071100"," move to the upside on Bitcoin."
"4071580","4075420"," So let's look at this on another basis here. "
"4075420","4079540"," And just see what we're looking at here."
"4082280","4089680"," As we tag this one here, we're going to expect a move down, move up, move down, and then that"
"4089680","4090600"," tag right there."
"4093560","4095399"," And possibly right there. "
"4095560","4097779"," That's all I'm going to give you right now in this turn."
"4099720","4103840"," And I would expect after this to be grinding to the upside."
"4103840","4106500"," I don't think this is top, by the way. "
"4106979","4108279"," That's 44,000."
"4108340","4111260"," I think we're going to a much, much higher high."
"4111460","4113660"," But then thereafter, you've got these sellers above anyways. "
"4114399","4116600"," These guys are trying to tell you no."
"4118740","4121660"," So I would not have another trade until we got above it."
"4124420","4131300"," Or I should say I'd really like to see from that point some consolidation here. "
"4131300","4136760"," And then we'll start talking about higher highs above this one here."
"4137220","4139120"," I'm not really interested in this part of the trade."
"4139460","4141600"," These sellers are going to try to come in and slap you down. "
"4142160","4143939"," But I am interested in this up here."
"4144080","4146080"," This trade I like here is no problem."
"4146620","4157300"," And as long as we're above, as long as price remains right now, above 41, 311, 58, the"
"4157300","4161040"," upward trend is in play right now. "
"4161040","4163680"," That upward bullish move."
"4164340","4166439"," Come back here and at least see all this stuff."
"4166880","4168520"," Now you get the double top above here. "
"4170000","4172420"," So I'm interested in that over here."
"4173000","4175620"," But this up here, I'd really like to see this happen."
"4175880","4178960"," So it's not a double top when you get above and continue that run higher. "
"4182250","4184050"," What was the other you guys wanted to snow?"
"4188819","4191580"," Snowflake coming into its monthly trigger."
"4192520","4195120"," We know that when price is below its monthly trigger, it's negative."
"4195640","4197620"," We are swinging up though into its monthly trigger. "
"4197720","4198500"," This is a 30 minute chart."
"4199140","4201900"," And we have a five trigger cluster here."
"4201900","4203120"," That's that's growing. "
"4204060","4205100"," I do like it."
"4205280","4205720"," The ticker here."
"4205780","4207660"," I like the accumulation that's going on down below. "
"4208140","4210620"," I would really like to see these."
"4210960","4212340"," In fact, you got another ticker right here."
"4212400","4216500"," The next week or two here, snow should get violence to the upside. "
"4216780","4218240"," And let's take a look on the daily."
"4218680","4222080"," All gorgeous structure price target on snow, dude."
"4222080","4226380"," You guys are looking to mess around in this ticker, aren't you?"
"4228040","4228780"," Target 220. "
"4229420","4231040"," Next target to the upside."
"4231480","4232640"," You got them all over the place, right?"
"4232820","4233680"," You got another one right here."
"4234820","4236740"," You got another one right over here. "
"4238040","4239620"," The little guy right in there."
"4240400","4242700"," And then you got another gapper right here that needs filled."
"4243600","4245320"," Right in there. "
"4245680","4246380"," That's like 325."
"4247380","4248680"," So you are moving."
"4248920","4250560"," You are getting extremely bullish here. "
"4251540","4253480"," Whatever, whatever push up you have."
"4253780","4254880"," Remember that daily trigger?"
"4255660","4257300"," Come up here, grind, grind, grind."
"4257560","4262380"," You're going to be looking for the daily trigger and the weekly trigger as we consolidate in here"
"4262380","4267020"," to start to push you to these extreme highs. "
"4267560","4268400"," I really like snow here."
"4269140","4270620"," If you're a snowball, whatever, call that one out."
"4270740","4271760"," I really like that ticker. "
"4271940","4273380"," So this is good."
"4273860","4276940"," Now remember, we have to get above this monthly trigger here."
"4277140","4278760"," Anything below is still bearish. "
"4278760","4284040"," But once the all this momentum comes from the downside of the upside, we should rip to the upside."
"4284440","4285540"," So I like snow here."
"4285780","4287020"," I'd be monitoring this. "
"4287360","4290980"," Hey, Chance, that you have to buy a dip on this ticker."
"4291020","4292320"," You want some exact targets?"
"4293600","4298320"," 174.95. 174.85. I'd love to buy that."
"4299140","4300260"," Right there. "
"4301220","4303520"," So there is my buy zone."
"4304440","4309940"," 174.180. And you'll get this like grinding action, grinding action."
"4310700","4314300"," As with every day, we move up and up and up and up. "
"4314700","4317400"," And eventually we will explode to the upside here."
"4319200","4321040"," If at any point we break above."
"4321800","4322740"," Say this too. "
"4324700","4326840"," If at any point you break above 193."
"4328100","4328340"," Right."
"4328440","4333380"," If you actually have a lot of break above and hold it and start heading higher and break these"
"4333380","4335760"," prior highs, I'd be long there as well. "
"4336040","4338100"," So keep your eyes on 193 as well."
"4338700","4342060"," For a beginning of a squeeze to the upside."
"4343060","4352920"," Let's go back to the"
"4352920","4354000"," main screen. "
"4360600","4365540"," January 22, 2022 high, 467, 13."
"4366180","4376080"," I want a short"
"4376080","4377160"," SPX into the ground."
"4377500","4377760"," Fuck. "
"4377940","4378420"," Yeah, I do."
"4378420","4381640"," If I'm thinking about somebody just said you want to show us space."
"4381860","4383940"," Yeah, like I'll be honest with you. "
"4384900","4389140"," Well, you've got my I've got my main street hat, right?"
"4389420","4392100"," And then I've got my trainer hat."
"4392500","4397120"," And then I've got my emotional hat, my brain hat or not my brain but my heart hat."
"4397500","4400580"," And yeah, that's a good question. "
"4400940","4404580"," Why do I have the feeling of wanting to short SPX into the ground?"
"4405720","4407260"," Let's talk about that right now."
"4407260","4409140"," So we have the sixth highest."
"4411260","4413240"," Here, let me give you a quick second here. "
"4414520","4416220"," I'm going to show you guys some stuff here."
"4417020","4418900"," This isn't what I think is going to happen."
"4418920","4420000"," I trade what's in front of me. "
"4420080","4427060"," But I know or I think that I'm not the only person out there that wants to short this shit"
"4427060","4427580"," into the ground."
"4428280","4431460"," No, that doesn't mean 3500 or anything."
"4431460","4438300"," But one, two, three, four, five days of some just cooling off and blood. "
"4438660","4441780"," I think that I think that's a sentiment that's pretty."
"4443000","4448200"," If you're a trainer, if you're like a supply and demand side trainer, not a bull or a bear, you're"
"4448200","4452420"," probably at a point of wanting to see that happen."
"4452700","4458840"," Then there's this whole other group of people that buy and sell spreads, fly holders, sellers,"
"4459360","4460460"," straddle sellers. "
"4462200","4463780"," They're all in pain right now."
"4464040","4466140"," So there's Megan Hopin."
"4466300","4468720"," You got ball people out there getting crushed. "
"4469300","4470260"," Give me one quick second."
"4470260","4471260"," I want to show you guys some cool."
"4471740","4473500"," Give me one quick second here. "
"4480620","4483220"," This was a, I got a cool one for you."
"4483400","4487240"," So I was chatting with or I was, I made a comment."
"4489120","4490320"," I had made a comment. "
"4490840","4494920"," Two days ago or something or yes, today is yesterday's day before."
"4495100","4495840"," And I was like, you know what?"
"4496180","4500460"," I looked back to 2012 and the higher we go here."
"4501400","4505220"," How it ends is usually in a fast correction. "
"4505800","4506220"," Big one."
"4506480","4507900"," Big, big correction."
"4509480","4511240"," And it's really fast. "
"4511820","4512480"," Then yesterday."
"4512480","4512900"," Then yesterday."
"4518120","4519760"," What did I see?"
"4519920","4525280"," I saw something yesterday that was, let me see if I can find this what I saw yesterday. "
"4529240","4531580"," Let me see."
"4533140","4534600"," What did I find yesterday here?"
"4537450","4539070"," The sixth highest."
"4541610","4543210"," One quick second here. "
"4547610","4553290"," Implied SPX dealer gamma finished at 1,300."
"4554150","4556690"," The sixth highest amount on record."
"4557990","4560550"," Sixth highest amount on record. "
"4561610","4565710"," And they kind of aligned with looking back in time."
"4567050","4572330"," Of the readings on the daily velocity on spy."
"4573730","4577810"," It's very rare to see our velocity as high as it actually is. "
"4578070","4579530"," So we're going to look at that right now."
"4580310","4586330"," And some historical, some prior historical examples of what happens."
"4587230","4589510"," So we have this huge high reading right now, right?"
"4589750","4594390"," And then also the daily velocity is giving us readings that is very rare. "
"4594690","4596030"," It's just not that common."
"4596250","4598610"," So we're going to take, let me see if I can take a look at this right now."
"4598710","4599930"," I'm going to set this up in the background. "
"4600870","4602030"," Give me one quick second here."
"4603110","4605050"," And see if I can set this up for you."
"4607170","4609030"," So is it what I think is going to happen?"
"4609430","4610010"," I don't know. "
"4610350","4611370"," I don't really care."
"4611950","4613490"," So if we go down there, we go down there."
"4613610","4616850"," But we're going to take a look at what we're talking about here. "
"4618410","4623910"," And just see if we can take a look back here."
"4624830","4625350"," One quick second."
"4629810","4632230"," I'll mark some of these off for you. "
"4655240","4656480"," How many are you going to mark off?"
"4656640","4658520"," How many is enough for you guys?"
"4658740","4659000"," I wonder."
"4671840","4673920"," Let's see if we can chat about this really quick."
"4676180","4676600"," Okay. "
"4678280","4680820"," So I want to show you a few things here."
"4681600","4683820"," And I apologize that all this is here."
"4683820","4685300"," It's kind of hard to see. "
"4685600","4690200"," But what I really want to show you here is these readings."
"4691420","4693760"," So let's take a look at this one right here."
"4694140","4698900"," And what we're looking for here is daily velocity. "
"4700480","4705260"," And I want to show you that's how high this daily fellow is right now."
"4706380","4708960"," And we don't have too many examples of it prior."
"4708960","4710700"," Prior history. "
"4711060","4711760"," Here's one right here."
"4711860","4712440"," This was the top."
"4713720","4715220"," That was the big boy right there. "
"4715580","4717720"," We had declining weekly velocity."
"4719120","4721640"," We had a peak and quarterly velocity."
"4722240","4725640"," And then we had a big, even bigger tell after once we got in here. "
"4726540","4727640"," We were peeking out."
"4727840","4731600"," This is where we're topping on quarterly, monthly and weekly velocity."
"4732320","4733520"," And we have declining weekly velocity. "
"4733520","4741340"," These things right here are a, are a indicator of declining under the surface of velocity, even"
"4741340","4744300"," though price is not showing a role in the marketplace."
"4744940","4745100"," Okay."
"4746500","4747480"," This is bad. "
"4747700","4747860"," Okay."
"4748740","4751440"," Notice the weekly velocity right now is actually declining."
"4752980","4754060"," But quarterly is at zero. "
"4754320","4755860"," There's some accumulation down below."
"4756120","4761240"," So whatever that role is going to be probably doesn't look like a crash here at this point."
"4761240","4762260"," It doesn't look like one. "
"4763960","4768940"," Looking in prior history here, we had increasing weekly velocity."
"4769360","4772680"," But so we had a little bit more squeeze higher, but then we had a major crash, right?"
"4774040","4777760"," Here's one from January of 2018, major pullback."
"4779660","4781700"," I'm going to show you a couple more back here. "
"4783020","4784920"," We had grind, grind, grind over here."
"4785240","4786260"," Here's one right here, right?"
"4786760","4790040"," And we ground, let's take a look at that one a little bit closer."
"4794520","4795800"," We had some quick blood. "
"4796500","4797620"," You can see it right here."
"4797740","4802760"," Just quick blood back down, grind, grind, grind, but then a, then a blast down later on."
"4803940","4805220"," We have another one right here. "
"4806480","4809520"," We had this, this is the one that everyone's on right now, right?"
"4809760","4813580"," This is the one that people are talking about where we just blast up, slap that 470."
"4814580","4818720"," And then a big pullback right here tag the monthly and just keep on moving to the upside."
"4820240","4822200"," This is not really the same here, right?"
"4822520","4825200"," I can't really call it because we're actually declining on the weekly. "
"4826040","4833040"," So we have probably less of that is a possibility than the declining weekly over here."
"4833340","4839000"," Here's another, this one's kind of inclining, but this one right here is a little bit closer."
"4839660","4846040"," Push up, blast back down, and then we, to the weekly trigger, and then we grind and eventually roll"
"4846040","4847520"," down, roll down one more time. "
"4847520","4848940"," So that's pretty much closer."
"4849340","4854780"," Anyways, what's really most important about this chart right here is we're peeking on this daily"
"4854780","4857080"," velocity to expect some kind of a pullback."
"4857760","4864360"," When that pullback is, I can't tell you I'm not, I don't have a crystal ball or anything like that"
"4864360","4868720"," to tell you guys where the roll comes or when it comes. "
"4869560","4873940"," But, you know, the sentiment out there is more of what I'm thinking."
"4873940","4878540"," I'm looking for retail sentiment when I make those statements, right?"
"4878760","4882140"," I'm like, hey, I would love to come in and short this shit down in the depths of hell."
"4882720","4885000"," And then check the comments, who's responding?"
"4885700","4886940"," Is it bears responding?"
"4887600","4888100"," Are they in pain?"
"4888780","4889920"," Is it bulls responding?"
"4890460","4892200"," And they're just like, yeah, get us a pullback. "
"4893080","4897500"," Or is it bulls that haven't ridden this up and just keep waiting for a pullback?"
"4897700","4899020"," They're not in the market right now."
"4899020","4905560"," So that's the reason I make those posts on Bintuit to find out sentiment from retail traders."
"4906740","4911520"," Especially when we are, especially when we have declining velocity right now. "
"4911540","4912800"," As a matter of fact, let's go back to that chart."
"4913680","4920140"," So just so you can see this right here on this daily fellow, even though price is careening higher,"
"4920540","4921840"," what can we tell here?"
"4921980","4927080"," And that is this velocity is starting to wane to the downside."
"4927820","4933120"," So there's a divergence right now in daily velocity and price on the stock market. "
"4934300","4935840"," So I'm fascinated by it."
"4936200","4940300"," The mechanics care could be really fast, really fast moving markets."
"4941320","4945180"," The coming days next two weeks and even into mid late January. "
"4950100","4951880"," Yeah, you're watching it too, Enco."
"4955060","4960260"," I'm very fascinated by what takes place and how fast this could move."
"4960920","4966100"," I'm scared that people could be on the right side of a trade and it reverses on them. "
"4967300","4973720"," And they get blown up for being on just one side of that trade, not being hedge, not being, just"
"4973720","4977140"," not closing at the right time rather than reacting."
"4977500","4985820"," I think this is a good time to be on the reaction side of this trade and not necessarily on"
"4985820","4988060"," the follow of this trade."
"4988360","4991380"," Like, hey, I'm going to follow this all the way up and not be hedged and I'll be able to"
"4991380","4991960"," close in time. "
"4993080","4995420"," You can wake up tomorrow and the shit's on fire, right?"
"4996260","5000720"," So you either have to be hedged chasing this up or you sit on your hands, you wait for the"
"5000720","5003200"," roll and you get in on the roll side of this trade."
"5006570","5007790"," Yeah, brother, I see it, bro."
"5008250","5008870"," I see it, man. "
"5009110","5009470"," I've been watching."
"5009690","5014430"," I don't want to say much about it because I'm like, I don't want to be a doom bear and"
"5014430","5015230"," all that kind of stuff."
"5015890","5017770"," Too many people pay, like too many people. "
"5017850","5021370"," It's not like I don't like have a hundred thousand fucking followers or a million followers, but,"
"5021610","5027210"," you know, people watch and anything you say is taken as the, you're like right in a fucking Bible"
"5027210","5027890"," for people."
"5028230","5032330"," Another thing too about people is you'll, you'll give them both sides of the coin."
"5032330","5034130"," You'll be like, Hey, this can happen and that can happen. "
"5034370","5041670"," And they fucking latch on to whatever narrative feeds the feeds their thesis or their positioning."
"5042750","5044490"," But that is happening in the background."
"5044490","5047070"," So, like in the background, Anthco. "
"5048670","5054470"," So, uh, Anthco, man, underneath the surface, there's some stuff going on back there."
"5055010","5056230"," Uh, there really is."
"5056450","5058430"," So, and I don't know what it happens, man. "
"5058690","5063290"," On the 15th, we lose a bunch of gamma on the 15th."
"5063990","5065310"," It's not necessarily a moment."
"5065450","5068210"," It could be a moment of weakness or an opening the door to hire. "
"5068330","5069450"," But he knows at this point, right?"
"5069450","5078670"," The indexes are tied to an underlying ticker symbol expiry on the late January."
"5079150","5081110"," I thought it was the 15th, but I guess the 19th."
"5081310","5083910"," I think we've got, uh, expiration on the 17th January. "
"5084110","5088910"," Those that could prop the market up all the way into that January 15th, 19th."
"5089010","5092650"," You guys know what traditionally the market does as well."
"5093090","5097010"," Uh, let me show you guys what the tradition, uh, you guys may show some traditional charts here. "
"5097710","5099350"," I think tight one second here."
"5102580","5107080"," I was going through SPX, uh, asset managers plus leverage money."
"5107780","5109180"," Long, short ratio this morning. "
"5109200","5112820"," Now we're going to look at, um, we're going to take a look at what's here."
"5118710","5121010"," Um, what am I looking for here?"
"5123650","5126270"," Not treasury yields seasonality."
"5126490","5127810"," We're only going to SPX seasonality. "
"5130210","5138170"," See if I can get this up and we are squeezing higher when we should be rolling down, right?"
"5138370","5139570"," We've got a divergence right here."
"5139670","5143310"," We should be squeezing down and they just said, fuck you were buying that dip."
"5143310","5144350"," We're going higher, right?"
"5144790","5146770"," Starting the holiday run early in here. "
"5147430","5152510"," Uh, though we tend to over time, uh, kind of track where we're going, right?"
"5153470","5157090"," Uh, but we can get outsized moves in the market past two, three years."
"5157090","5158790"," We've had volatility up and down."
"5159290","5164530"," Uh, so even though we have this, uh, divergence, we can and we'll, and we'll, we'll likely pull"
"5164530","5167770"," back down or back down more in line with the seasonality. "
"5168150","5172610"," But what I really like to draw your attention to is, uh, next year is expected."
"5173130","5177950"," Uh, moves in the, this goes into, uh, the 25th."
"5178870","5181230"," Uh, 21st trading day of 2024. "
"5181230","5184870"," Uh, for last year, right?"
"5185070","5188310"," Last year's price action, but look at the normal price action."
"5188310","5189350"," We grind up typically."
"5189890","5192470"," Into the 33rd. "
"5192810","5195190"," Uh, trading day of the year."
"5195450","5196070"," Now."
"5196890","5201290"," Uh, uh, season now, uh, seasonally wise, we usually get, uh. "
"5201970","5210130"," Outperformance by A.W. Are IWM, whereas, uh, we have underperformance by SPX and NDX as well into,"
"5210130","5215550"," uh, March, but you should find another dip to buy and be able to trade this up into."
"5216630","5223650"," Uh, trade this up or trade out of you up into an extension into, um, late March, uh, especially if"
"5223650","5226410"," we continue to pause on rate hikes."
"5226990","5229550"," So there's your seasonality chart for you. "
"5234410","5235890"," See you guys get going on here."
"5239170","5240030"," Hey, what's going on?"
"5240050","5241190"," Well, I'm good morning, brother."
"5241270","5241890"," Good to see you. "
"5246290","5250370"," Uh, oh, yeah."
"5250710","5251690"," UNG, the Widowmaker."
"5252110","5252850"," I don't trade those. "
"5253070","5254910"," I don't trade that Widowmaker stuff, man."
"5255210","5261130"," Every time I trade a UNG, any kind of net of gas stuff, I'm like, I'm like, this is money"
"5261130","5261690"," I'm never getting."
"5261890","5265310"," It's trading UNG is like, loaning money to your brother. "
"5265830","5269450"," Do you want to lose your brother or do you just expect he's never paying you back?"
"5270410","5272070"," Um, like you can't really hold."
"5276370","5277510"," You didn't exit."
"5278330","5280530"," You're still in it right on right on. "
"5282170","5282950"," There you go."
"5283130","5284190"," Santos, how are you?"
"5285590","5286450"," Uh, yeah."
"5287210","5290310"," Santos, I'm going to basically a straddle right now. "
"5290310","5291690"," I don't care where we go at this point."
"5292030","5297350"," Let's move into the discussion about what we should expect into this rate decision."
"5298290","5302090"," Some what the markets expecting for moves. "
"5304150","5310510"," There's some people out there saying that there are people out there saying there's a silent drum"
"5310510","5316690"," beat of saying, um, Valk crush IV crush."
"5318210","5320250"," Uh, you're not going to see a lot of fireworks today."
"5320270","5323210"," There's, there's this, um, opinion of that. "
"5323690","5327250"," We've had a lot of those, uh, rate decision days."
"5327950","5330590"," In previous history that all of our previous pause."
"5331330","5334150"," Rate decisions with, we just, they like crush it, right?"
"5334690","5338270"," When they vacuum up at the end of the day and then we get to move the next day or"
"5338270","5340990"," two after the actual event. "
"5340990","5343750"," So, uh, maybe we'll get more of that today."
"5344770","5347550"," Uh, so let me, let me look at something really quick here."
"5349110","5351330"," Where you get everybody all fired up, right?"
"5351650","5354830"," And, uh, we don't actually get an outsized move. "
"5355410","5356470"," So let's take a look."
"5356670","5359250"," I want to see what the expected moves are on."
"5361010","5363810"," Well, S on spy at least. "
"5364830","5368990"," So right here, just keep an eye on, uh, my cursor right here."
"5368990","5374010"," It's implied move right now expected move is 0.5% upper down for the 13."
"5374430","5375130"," That's today. "
"5375610","5385270"," Uh, we got 467.14 and then 462.49. Moving into the 14th, we've got an upside target of"
"5385270","5392310"," 468.11. 461.56. Uh, the same thing on Friday, 469.42 and 469."
"5393070","5398470"," I want to make a note to you that these expected ranges are, they're like toilet paper."
"5398970","5402590"," There's good as the paper that they're written on and can be burned at any time. "
"5403270","5408770"," Uh, these things move with, uh, price, these expected moves, uh, what's being priced in."
"5409070","5415330"," So we can always blast down here and then you, you reform this, uh, uh, this expected, uh, this,"
"5415390","5416990"," this dealer pricing for down the road."
"5417110","5419250"," So just be aware of that that it's only good for current price. "
"5419970","5420910"," Uh, we'll look at this for today."
"5420950","5429720"," We've got a 467 and 462.51. And we'll mark those off right now."
"5436080","5452780"," 467.14. And"
"5452780","5453640"," look at that. "
"5455180","5457520"," Let's see if we can do this, uh, with you guys watching here."
"5457980","5459320"," Okay, so this is a Webull chart."
"5459980","5464940"," Uh, dealer implied move to the upside is 467.14. We're not dealer implied. "
"5465080","5465380"," Excuse me."
"5465480","5468220"," Options implied move at this point, right where we are."
"5468780","5497800"," Upside move, uh, 467.14. Downside expected move on the day is 462.48. So"
"5497800","5498820"," right around there. "
"5498980","5505000"," So if you're a dealer right now, uh, you're expecting, uh, no more than this move upside."
"5505780","5506260"," Okay."
"5506940","5512480"," Uh, on the day on the downside, the expected move right now to the downside is right down there on"
"5512480","5512840"," the day. "
"5514660","5522380"," So what we'll do here is, uh, or what I would say to you here is, uh, that we, when"
"5522380","5529080"," this, when this, uh, 2 p.m. right, you have the rate decision right there."
"5529600","5532660"," And then we've got the, uh, presser at 230."
"5533940","5534620"," Right there. "
"5538080","5538540"," Right."
"5538780","5539140"," So."
"5541020","5545000"," I would say to you that as we come into this two o'clock hour in here. "
"5546840","5550000"," Um, if we hit this two o'clock hour, let's say we drag down here."
"5550680","5552660"," Into that downside expected move."
"5552660","5555360"," Uh, I would expect us to fail it. "
"5555680","5556940"," And then the same thing to the upside."
"5557180","5559580"," If it's upside expected move, maybe we can come up here."
"5559920","5560840"," Then I would expect a failure. "
"5562520","5563420"," Repricing of options."
"5566120","5570300"," And even if we're going to go to the upside on some good news, I would expect that up down."
"5570860","5571280"," Reprised. "
"5571400","5573240"," Then we make the move to the upside."
"5574360","5580220"," To try to break above this, uh, 467.14. But in all honesty, a lot of these events we've had."
"5580220","5587200"," Uh, we've seen oftentimes, uh, the blood at the upside and then a grind right into the clothes"
"5587200","5588100"," dealers come out. "
"5588580","5589540"," Thank you for playing."
"5590020","5594760"," You don't get the move down that you're looking for and you don't get the move up that you're"
"5594760","5595380"," looking for."
"5595580","5599760"," You get some failures in here and you're all, we're all like, yeah, let's do this. "
"5599900","5600340"," Let's do this."
"5601300","5604920"," And sure enough, they fail it just below the expected move."
"5605040","5608040"," They fail it just below the upside expected move. "
"5608040","5610240"," And you're caught holding the bag."
"5610640","5615040"," And then after all of this re-pricing that takes place, the real move comes tomorrow."
"5615900","5623940"," If the market moves too fast for you, uh, on these, uh, rate decision days, I do really like, uh,"
"5624400","5625280"," especially late. "
"5625560","5631760"," I really have enjoyed, uh, really enjoyed waiting for these violent moves to the downside."
"5632720","5635920"," Uh, to buy some calls, even if it's only for a moment."
"5635920","5641700"," Uh, as we head back up here and then I'll cut them loose and then I'll like, uh, get some"
"5641700","5644560"," puts in here and then try to take that to the downside. "
"5644920","5648300"," So this is more of a reactionary move, reactionary move."
"5649280","5654700"," Also, if you're getting all kinds of bullish as we come up oftentimes, once we get into the, uh,"
"5655020","5660400"," once we get into the, uh, Jerome Powell presser, we'll see some pullback on the presser news."
"5661460","5664100"," And possibly the, uh, questioning that takes place. "
"5664140","5667900"," You could see some of that weakness, uh, in that actual presser."
"5668140","5672680"," Uh, then we make, might continue higher or blood down into the close and just close right down"
"5672680","5672880"," here."
"5673300","5676860"," Uh, so just be careful of these two, uh, time frames. "
"5677360","5683240"," Uh, this, this two o'clock hour, this two 30 hour, uh, will oftentimes see resets as, as we come"
"5683240","5684880"," into that two o'clock and then two 30 hour."
"5692200","5695080"," I'll leave this down here before you see, you can actually see it."
"5696320","5702840"," We will have, uh, the presser and the rate decision playing live on the show today as well. "
"5713160","5717700"," But he got here, Kendall said that the important thing that matters today is what he says about QT."
"5717900","5718580"," I agree with that."
"5719220","5722780"," I think that's, uh, you guys want me to take on this, I will give it to you. "
"5723400","5729640"," Uh, Jerome Powell, you know, in my view, uh, in my view is in a corner right now."
"5729640","5733120"," Um, he has not raised rates in five months."
"5733640","5738240"," Uh, historically, if we do not get a raise at this meeting. "
"5738960","5743980"," We will not see another raise again, regardless of what he says to you today."
"5744860","5746800"," He probably knows this."
"5747100","5752640"," I'm going to, I'm going to, like Jenny Ellen this morning was saying, and what we do is in art. "
"5755990","5762210"," You'll, you can, you people that work for the fed and for the treasury department have written"
"5762210","5771830"," accounts of their experiences in the smart people that surround these officials and how much"
"5771830","5774550"," data is given to these officials."
"5775350","5784130"," And yet they still these officials still think they'll read that data and say, I'm better than that"
"5784130","5784470"," data."
"5784930","5793350"," I have a feeling this is what we should do that in that serendipitous human, um, that fucking human"
"5793350","5796610"," this man that people have right that ego that people have. "
"5796610","5798730"," Uh, and so."
"5800070","5804070"," I'm, I don't know what Dato Jerome was presented with today."
"5804510","5808150"," Yellen sounded quite dovish today this morning to me at least. "
"5808750","5815010"," Um, but Jerome's going to come into this great decision today and he likely knows that, uh, behind"
"5815010","5815970"," the scenes."
"5817690","5823570"," That if he does not raise rates that this market has already began to move."
"5824650","5831230"," Forward pricing in, uh, this pause being permanent leading to eventual rate cuts. "
"5831590","5836630"," Uh, and it's just waiting on him to say higher for law or at least, you know, higher for longer."
"5837410","5842690"," Uh, and those wheels will should continue to turn and try to time."
"5843170","5848670"," Uh, about one to three months before we get actual rate cuts to send this market to the depths of"
"5848670","5848850"," hell. "
"5850410","5853530"," My, my non trader hat, my main street hat."
"5854010","5859510"," I hope that he comes out with a surprise 25 rate, uh, BPS rate hike today."
"5859950","5861030"," Uh, I really do. "
"5861250","5861810"," I'll be honest with you."
"5862430","5863850"," I want him to break shit."
"5864290","5867630"," If you're a young person, you want him to break shit. "
"5867630","5873830"," You heard Yellen this morning saying we've had stabilization in rental prices for young people."
"5873830","5874890"," You heard that this morning, right?"
"5875290","5876030"," You know what that means?"
"5876750","5881710"," They're in line with year over year inflation continuing higher."
"5883230","5888570"," So that $2,000 for rent in a, uh, you know, the rest of America. "
"5888890","5891890"," It's going to still only go up just more slowly."
"5893230","5899230"," Those places in America that are desirable to live, like the Santa Monica's, the LA's, the San"
"5899230","5902370"," Frans, whatever it is, wherever is the bail Miami."
"5903230","5908030"," That $5,000 to $15,000 that's staying and will only now slowly go up. "
"5908610","5911430"," That's not really good enough for young people."
"5911430","5912870"," So that's my main street hat."
"5913430","5913590"," Okay. "
"5914290","5915650"," Uh, that's what I hope that he does."
"5915990","5919930"," The other reason that I hope that he does this is because he resets."
"5919930","5928010"," Uh, if he does 25 VPS today, he resets, uh, those big mechanical whales moving in the background"
"5928010","5930510"," and buys him another five or six months. "
"5930910","5932750"," Uh, for hire for longer."
"5933070","5938010"," Now, my trader hat says we have priced in, uh, no rate hike."
"5938590","5942510"," And, uh, a hawkish fed hawkish talk. "
"5943150","5947070"," Uh, that is the most probable and likely outcome today that you're going to get."
"5947070","5949690"," Jerome Powell with no rate hike."
"5950290","5952670"," Uh, you're likely going to get a hawkish fed. "
"5953630","5957870"," Uh, and he's likely going to try to talk this market down, uh, today."
"5958710","5963790"," The trick for that is does he does the market believe that I'm going to be honest with you as"
"5963790","5964010"," a trader."
"5964450","5965590"," I don't fucking think they will. "
"5965910","5971950"," I think they're going to price in, uh, no more rate hikes and you are going to see, uh, the"
"5971950","5972330"," markets."
"5972330","5979110"," Um, also force that hand coming into next year, you know that, uh, you know that I've stuck with my"
"5979110","5982390"," thesis of will be cutting rates by October of 2024."
"5983090","5986330"," That the unemployment rate will be racing up to that six and eight percent. "
"5986410","5992030"," No matter what they do, uh, trying to fudge those numbers, you'll likely see inflation come down"
"5992030","5996490"," into that, uh, two percent target and we will ricochet off of it."
"5996490","6001870"," You even heard Yellen this morning say that, uh, that we should bounce down there at that two"
"6001870","6002250"," percent."
"6002590","6004130"," She said that in her interview this morning. "
"6004130","6006470"," So, uh, it's a."
"6006650","6011570"," Now, if that happens today, you're likely going, or if that happens today, you're likely going to"
"6011570","6018630"," see, um, those, those, those wheels continue to move forward, uh, and bet against Jerome Powell"
"6018630","6020850"," holding rates past 2024."
"6021490","6024470"," Uh, not cutting into late 2024."
"6025050","6027950"," Now, what is not priced in today is what?"
"6028150","6028990"," 25 BPS. "
"6029290","6030510"," What else isn't priced in today?"
"6031170","6032790"," Uh, not a hawkish fed."
"6033210","6035530"," I was asking a short seller ST this yesterday."
"6035990","6037630"," Uh, and I was being serious. "
"6038170","6040310"," Uh, have we priced, I have that question."
"6040930","6045830"," Have we priced in, uh, have we actually priced in, uh, no rate hike."
"6046630","6051150"," And a hawkish, uh, interview today or, uh, presser today. "
"6051790","6057250"," If you were to come out today and, um, do a victory lap, that's not really priced in, is it?"
"6057990","6061710"," Uh, so if we priced this in, we should be flat on the market on the day, right?"
"6061990","6065650"," So if we get 25 BPS, or excuse me, if we get a, if we get no rate hike and"
"6065650","6066330"," we get a hawkish fed."
"6067130","6072030"," Ultimately, we should wake up tomorrow with all of this priced in, right?"
"6072290","6073550"," No big moves up or down."
"6074030","6076710"," Stay where, or stay on the trend that we're on. "
"6077750","6083690"," If you get fed, uh, Jay Powell today that comes out and has the green tie on and is going"
"6083690","6087090"," to take a victory lap, which Yellen is hinting at this morning."
"6087090","6093330"," That, uh, she's taking not a victory lap, but she sounded pretty, pretty fucking, like, pretty"
"6093330","6093770"," dovish."
"6094050","6099050"," I don't know if I agree with her, but she is, you know, she's pushing that narrative this morning"
"6099050","6099590"," on CNBC. "
"6100670","6109650"," Um, so that might be a, a, uh, a leak of Jerome Powell coming out in a similar fashion, uh,"
"6109770","6110010"," today."
"6114330","6115910"," Uh, I don't think it works anymore."
"6116270","6119650"," I think that, I think that the market knows, I think that the market knows. "
"6119650","6124870"," I don't think, I think the market's not going to listen a lot to him from this point forward, but"
"6124870","6125870"," that's his job, right?"
"6126570","6131110"," Uh, that's his, or his job is to try to trade this market sideways until the election."
"6131770","6137330"," Uh, basically not, and not go too far down and close the door on anything lower than 3,500."
"6138190","6141450"," Uh, and that's what Biden wants as well. "
"6141710","6145110"," So, and that way that works or not, I don't know, but that's what I think."
"6145670","6155520"," Um, so, yeah, so I'm fascinated to see what that, what this, uh,"
"6155640","6156860"," meeting is now."
"6157200","6158700"," Can he, that's the next question. "
"6159280","6161640"," Here's one that I haven't heard many people talk about."
"6162320","6165340"," And that is, uh, that is what that is."
"6166420","6168360"," We put this up for you guys, so you can see it. "
"6169500","6172080"," The one thing that I've ever heard too many people talk about is."
"6173400","6180460"," When the next rate decision is after this one, it would be fascinating if he said no rate hike."
"6181960","6186920"," Uh, but I'm going to keep raising data dependence, blah, blah, blah, data dependence on the other"
"6186920","6187180"," shit. "
"6187560","6190040"," That thing he does, but then he throws in something like."
"6191460","6196460"," Hey, by the way, uh, we, we've got, we've penciled in a rate decision in January."
"6197080","6199700"," Uh, that could be not priced in. "
"6200120","6202820"," Uh, and that could be the sword that he needs to rattle."
"6203000","6208580"," That saber that he needs to rattle is to promise a rate decision in like January or something."
"6209120","6212740"," Uh, and that could potentially arrest the market as well. "
"6213380","6218540"," Uh, some, that's my little, if I had like one little thing saying that I'm looking for is, uh, do"
"6218540","6222240"," they announce today or even tomorrow, just say, Hey, we're going to have another rate decision"
"6222240","6224140"," coming up here, uh, really soon."
"6226780","6231520"," Yeah, that would be, uh, that could, that could be a nice saber rattle."
"6234740","6238660"," Like I'm watching, not only am I watching, but I'll be back here with you soon. "
"6246890","6249910"," Uh, any comments on timing of cuts will be very key."
"6250030","6253670"," Believe JP has said that in events that it may not happen anytime soon."
"6253730","6254830"," I hope they do 25 BPS. "
"6255650","6258490"," Yeah, his on the, on the."
"6258490","6265130"," All the, I mean, at this point, he can, he can threaten, I guess, just keep threatening as long as"
"6265130","6265730"," the market believes."
"6265930","6267250"," Am I really do think though, man?"
"6267710","6270670"," Uh, I think he's done. "
"6270890","6271490"," I really do."
"6271590","6272170"," I think he's done."
"6272490","6275590"," And I think the, he just has to make the market believe him as long as possible. "
"6279280","6280320"," Getting's going to eat in Detties."
"6284860","6288840"," What if he keeps rates higher for longer and market priced in cuts in 2024?"
"6289460","6294220"," Uh, he can do that, but the market can run against him as my point."
"6295000","6301560"," Um, the market can, can kind of force him, uh, not only into rates, like good. "
"6301760","6303520"," Prime example is that COVID, right?"
"6304020","6309700"," And even then, uh, we continue down for another two and a half weeks or something like that until"
"6309700","6311280"," he bounced off the quarterly, uh, trigger."
"6312000","6314800"," Uh, so yeah, he can be forced into cutting rates."
"6315000","6317040"," The market can force him into cutting rates. "
"6317520","6320380"," Uh, yesterday we talked about the bond vigilantes as well."
"6320800","6331720"," I'm not going to bring that up today because it's so far out, but what"
"6331720","6332320"," else we got there?"
"6335630","6337250"," Yeah, I got a bunch of those cheap puts."
"6337450","6339810"," I got like fucking puts that are worthless right now. "
"6340030","6342690"," Like penny puts just in case we roll down hard and heavy today."
"6344290","6352500"," Uh, I missed your thesis here, Daniel."
"6352600","6353220"," Let me read it. "
"6353360","6353660"," Hold on, brother."
"6353940","6354160"," It's hard."
"6354280","6355880"," I want you guys to understand some of my end. "
"6356320","6357720"," I've got two chats going."
"6358000","6362600"," Uh, so it's hard for me to keep up with chat and then I've got another main chat that combines"
"6362600","6364220"," both chats and it lags."
"6364540","6365820"," So I apologize to you out there. "
"6366920","6369720"," Um, let me see what you're saying here, Daniel."
"6370540","6371720"," Let me scroll back up, brother."
"6374180","6376740"," Daniel has the saying cap. "
"6377020","6379300"," Why do you keep saying you want him to crash the market?"
"6379720","6382080"," The population will move around to cheap areas."
"6382300","6382980"," It's normal migration."
"6383300","6386040"," People realize things are too expensive or the politics are. "
"6386580","6388200"," Uh, why do I want it to market crash?"
"6388480","6389300"," It's a good question, Daniel."
"6389880","6394060"," Um, I am, uh, I'm older."
"6394700","6398560"," So I know where those generational buying opportunities are. "
"6398780","6399960"," I saw one in October."
"6399960","6405400"," Um, but anytime we get major pullbacks, uh, I am a bull."
"6405740","6408540"," I like to buy major capitulations. "
"6409000","6412600"," Uh, I like to buy major, uh, resets in the market."
"6412840","6415120"," There's an argument to made that we're at that place right now."
"6415920","6421360"," Um, and we I showed you guys a Ford PE ratio of rest and P 500 rebouncing right on the"
"6421360","6423820"," trend line right now to buy the S&P 500. "
"6424320","6430000"," I can see us going to 6000 quickly, but any blood that we get, I like to buy."
"6430260","6432680"," So, uh, let me explain my bullish position."
"6433420","6434500"," I want to be clear about this. "
"6435160","6436300"," Um, I'm a bull."
"6436440","6436660"," Okay."
"6437360","6446140"," But I'm not the bull that's on, uh, Twitter, uh, go and woo, as we're, uh, at a top, uh,"
"6446300","6449460"," local top, uh, quarterly top or any of that kind of stuff. "
"6449460","6455840"," I mean, usually the guy that's out there trying to buy a bottom while the market is literally on"
"6455840","6456320"," fire."
"6457360","6461220"," Um, and most of my friends are the same way."
"6461360","6464560"," We're looking to buy the, uh, most of my friends. "
"6464920","6468900"," We're looking for the doom and gloom always, never the euphoria."
"6469200","6472300"," So, um, I welcome that stuff."
"6472820","6477600"," Uh, you normally, that's the shit that keeps me in, uh, keeps me even not having to have a job"
"6477600","6479080"," is, is, uh, doom and gloom. "
"6479080","6482700"," So, whenever there's more doom and gloom, um, I love it."
"6482980","6485480"," I love, I can't stand tops because that means I'm exiting."
"6485960","6491740"," That means that I'm not, uh, long in any way or exiting long, like underlying positions owning the"
"6491740","6492680"," stock market, that kind of stuff. "
"6493100","6494200"," And looking for the next dip."
"6494360","6499860"," So, uh, I'm looking for that generational buying opportunity, uh, which we haven't had since, uh,"
"6500160","6500340"," what?"
"6500340","6505680"," Uh, I mean, they had a great dip buying opportunity in COVID, but 2008, 2001."
"6506100","6507980"," So if that ever comes, I'm on it. "
"6508160","6508600"," I'm on it."
"6508600","6508980"," I would love it."
"6510120","6511320"," Uh, what else we got here?"
"6512380","6515160"," Uh, that, and that includes like the housing, so I own houses. "
"6516140","6519440"," We let that includes the economy, uh, includes the price of everything."
"6520140","6522280"," Uh, resets are good men for short term debt cycles."
"6522480","6523160"," They're normal, natural. "
"6523540","6526640"," We haven't seen that, uh, reset of our short term debt cycle in our economy yet."
"6526800","6528560"," So that's what I'm real or more what I'm looking for."
"6529300","6531120"," Uh, what else we got here?"
"6531600","6535300"," We all pass what we all pass what we make onto our children when we die anyway or pay for"
"6535300","6536100"," all of our children's stuff. "
"6536220","6539400"," The only people that lose the market crashes are the citizens with money in it."
"6539700","6543900"," Uh, okay, so Daniel's making a commentary like he's saying, uh, we all pass."
"6544040","6547620"," We make on to our children when we die anyway or pay for all of our children's stuff. "
"6547820","6551380"," The only way people that lose when the market crashes are citizens with money in it."
"6552320","6554100"," So short term debt cycles."
"6554440","6554680"," Okay. "
"6554680","6558160"," Uh, this is a fundamental aspect to our economy."
"6558840","6565040"," Uh, what we do in the, in our economy, okay, is we try to, well, let's say, so in our"
"6565040","6574880"," economy, what we do, Daniel is, uh, we increase and decrease liquidity, keep money, uh, into our,"
"6575340","6576200"," uh, economy."
"6576440","6576540"," Okay. "
"6576540","6578900"," Uh, this is a function of our government."
"6579360","6588220"," Um, our government basically, uh, uh, eases money into our economy and then tightens money into our"
"6588220","6588520"," economy."
"6588660","6590220"," And why do we do that as the question?"
"6591340","6600060"," Uh, we do that because we want to seek growth and we want to, uh, wash out, uh, people that"
"6600060","6601660"," don't, they're supposed to do with that money. "
"6602340","6603580"," So let me give you an example."
"6604240","6605900"," So I'm a father, right?"
"6606200","6607080"," And I have children."
"6608080","6615540"," Uh, I give $100 to my oldest daughter and I give $100 to my youngest daughter. "
"6616320","6620820"," My oldest daughter, uh, takes that $100."
"6622500","6627520"," Takes that $100 and for five years, I give it to her five years and I say, you pay this"
"6627520","6628260"," back to me."
"6629200","6629220"," Right?"
"6630120","6636100"," So my oldest daughter takes the $100 and she turns it into $500. "
"6637000","6637480"," Right?"
"6639060","6641480"," And five years later, I say, I want $100 back."
"6641680","6643100"," So she gives me the hundred back, right?"
"6643640","6645880"," And now she's got $400 on her."
"6646000","6646500"," She's excited. "
"6646940","6647880"," She built life herself."
"6648220","6649240"," She's got a no debt."
"6649480","6651100"," She's cash rich. "
"6651700","6652280"," She'll be fine."
"6653040","6655220"," My other daughter, I give her the $100."
"6655780","6656360"," What does she do?"
"6657560","6658520"," Oh, she leverages it. "
"6659280","6661760"," Uh, she might leverage it into some good stuff."
"6661960","6663500"," She might leverage it into some bad stuff."
"6663980","6667360"," Uh, five years later, I come back to her and I say, I need my $100 back. "
"6668220","6674740"," And she looks at what she lever that leveraged that $100 into and those investments are not paying"
"6674740","6675520"," out for her."
"6676260","6680720"," Uh, they're like zombie companies or they're failing companies."
"6681360","6683360"," Uh, so I want my $100 back. "
"6683580","6684280"," She doesn't have it."
"6684460","6685340"," What do I force her to do?"
"6685700","6690920"," I force her to sell these bad investments that she's made to pay me back my $100."
"6690920","6694120"," Uh, she goes bankrupt in the process. "
"6694160","6696400"," I get my $100 back, right?"
"6696820","6698240"," Removing liquidity from the system."
"6698940","6702900"," And I'm also removing that bad investment, bad investor."
"6703340","6707000"," Sometimes they're just over overly burdened with debt, even good debt. "
"6707200","6708520"," They're just hanging on though."
"6709180","6709300"," Right?"
"6709600","6711640"," So I remove her from that system."
"6712220","6713160"," So what happens there?"
"6713160","6717280"," I wash out the daughter that is making bad investment choices, right?"
"6717460","6718220"," Cleaning up the system. "
"6718700","6720920"," I've got another daughter over here that's done a good job."
"6720940","6721700"," She's going to make it."
"6722340","6723800"," And so I've now tightened, right?"
"6724760","6727500"," And that's the part of the process that we're in right now. "
"6727520","6732880"," We're trying to tighten and remove the bad, uh, the bad debt that's out there, the people that"
"6732880","6733680"," didn't do what they're supposed"
"6733680","6743120"," to do."
"6743120","6749300"," That's sick or she, um, uh, she lost a leg or it's terrible to talk like this, but I'm trying"
"6749300","6750240"," to use the vehicle here."
"6750760","6753000"," Um, it doesn't matter really what she did. "
"6753240","6756480"," I need to, I need to wash her out of our system so that I keep the cream of the"
"6756480","6756700"," crop."
"6756940","6758320"," And then the next debt cycle."
"6758980","6761520"," I go to put more money into the system, right?"
"6761960","6764540"," And I'm going to offer that $100 once again. "
"6764780","6766780"," Now I look at my daughter that did great."
"6767080","6768020"," I give her another hundred."
"6768620","6770200"," Now the other daughter didn't do well. "
"6770300","6770980"," What do I do for her?"
"6771400","6771660"," Nothing."
"6772000","6772860"," She gets nothing."
"6773060","6773980"," She's too old now. "
"6774660","6776560"," So where do I put that second $100?"
"6777500","6779820"," I actually give it to someone younger than her."
"6779920","6782040"," Maybe her daughter, my granddaughter."
"6782680","6784000"," I go, here's a hundred for you. "
"6785020","6785420"," Right?"
"6786080","6787740"," And so the granddaughter is young, right?"
"6788020","6790120"," The older daughter that didn't do what she was supposed to do."
"6790120","6791220"," She's washed out of the system."
"6791740","6793900"," Now I'm giving $100 to this next generation. "
"6793920","6795740"," That's kind of the key point here, Daniel is."
"6796920","6802280"," We have a new generation of young people coming into our economy and you need to give them a chance"
"6802280","6809620"," to get a leg up in this next short or long term debt cycle we have ahead of us."
"6810120","6812820"," So that's the function of what we're trying or what they're trying to do. "
"6816320","6817640"," Does that work or no?"
"6818760","6820080"," As a soliloquy?"
"6820240","6821580"," I don't know if that works for you."
"6821820","6823240"," A simplified explanation."
"6824160","6825600"," And now I know there's pain in that. "
"6826400","6827900"," I know you don't want to hear that."
"6828200","6830840"," I know that it's not nice to say that."
"6831020","6832940"," I know you're not going to hear Jerome say that. "
"6833040","6834580"," You're not going to hear Yellen say that."
"6835360","6836880"," They're never going to say that publicly."
"6837520","6838540"," But that is what they do. "
"6839240","6839920"," That's what they do."
"6839920","6842460"," That's how our system, our capitalist system works."
"6842820","6843640"," You might not like it. "
"6843860","6844620"," You might like it."
"6844740","6847780"," You might think there should be more security in there."
"6849360","6850840"," But that's a different thing. "
"6850980","6852160"," That's my main street hat."
"6852780","6854420"," You know, yeah, I'm a Democrat, man."
"6854860","6855680"," I'll tell you, I'm a Democrat. "
"6856120","6862980"," But I got to separate those hats like my main street hat versus our economy functions, our system"
"6862980","6864460"," runs, how the stock market runs."
"6864460","6867460"," And so in every other market, bond market doesn't matter."
"6867880","6868580"," Housing market. "
"6869340","6875540"," And right now, it's hard to say that, Daniel, it's hard to say that a kid can afford to buy"
"6875540","6880000"," a home and that their pay is going to be in anticipating the next five or ten years."
"6880920","6881680"," What do they have to make?"
"6881960","6888980"," 200,000, 300,000, 400,000 just to make it after college or trade school, whatever they do."
"6890180","6892920"," And I'd like to see them be able to afford that stuff if possible. "
"6898100","6900140"," Carillo says, no, you let her leverage it again."
"6900460","6903340"," Yeah, she declares bankruptcy, tried to hide it all."
"6903440","6904900"," She gets into that money again, right?"
"6906100","6910420"," It's some of the reasons people, I'm going to say this to my youngest daughter in this example,"
"6910420","6910760"," right?"
"6912260","6917400"," Just because they get washed out is not always because not always because they've done something"
"6917400","6917760"," wrong. "
"6918480","6923780"," Some people with, so Daniel's saying, you know, people get hurt in this process that don't deserve"
"6923780","6923960"," it."
"6924060","6924720"," I agree with that."
"6925440","6934000"," I was talking to Joe Donut last night, and he was talking about the crash of 0708, and he was"
"6934000","6935420"," like, you know, my whole entire neighborhood. "
"6936180","6938960"," My whole entire neighborhood was empty."
"6939820","6941160"," I'm on mode lawns."
"6941520","6942200"," I was the only one left. "
"6943020","6948760"," He's like, when I sold my house, he's like, you know, that pain me to go through that process."
"6949340","6951340"," And he took some hits on that process."
"6952440","6958240"," So even though Joe Donut did the right thing, he still felt pain in that process. "
"6958240","6967980"," He was still sucked into that, that vortex of that short time debt cycle that we went through in"
"6967980","6968840"," 0708."
"6968840","6972200"," So, yeah, even if you're doing the right thing, you can feel that pain."
"6972600","6973740"," I don't disagree with that. "
"6978630","6980510"," Yeah, you know, I'm a bull."
"6980850","6983570"," So if, so my point stands, I'm a bull."
"6983790","6987050"," Whenever those three sets happen, I'm ready, right?"
"6987230","6992410"," So Joe and I were talking about this last night, and our thing was, would you want to reset?"
"6992410","6997770"," And both of our points was, fuck yeah, like I've paid my debt down. "
"6997910","6998850"," I've bought my houses."
"6999050","7001110"," I paid my mortgages down to zero."
"7002250","7003570"," I've done the right thing. "
"7003950","7007570"," So if the housing market were to crash, I'm there."
"7008310","7009470"," I'm ready to buy."
"7009870","7010950"," I've done the right shit. "
"7011170","7011810"," I suffered."
"7012490","7014370"," I suffered pain my debt down."
"7014490","7016050"," I suffered to be where I'm at. "
"7016630","7023410"," I went without when other people were driving around a fucking $140,000 brand spanking new F 250."
"7024030","7027170"," I had a few year old truck that I drove around."
"7027170","7028590"," I didn't live like that. "
"7029230","7033930"," I don't look to my friends like I have the wealth that I have."
"7034470","7039290"," My friends, I look poor on the surface, and I'm fine with that."
"7040150","7042690"," I'm fine with that because I want that generational wealth. "
"7042830","7046270"," I don't want to get caught in that fucking debt trap that most people get caught in."
"7046390","7048390"," I was caught in that debt trap for a lot of years."
"7048830","7051530"," For a lot of years, it was paycheck to paycheck. "
"7051970","7055010"," Even when I did well, when I made a lot of money, it was always paycheck to paycheck."
"7055410","7057330"," It was always looked good for the people."
"7057490","7058710"," It was always that kind of shit. "
"7059410","7061490"," And for me personally, I welcome that stuff."
"7061490","7063690"," So if it comes, I'm here waiting."
"7064370","7066430"," You reset the housing market, I'm ready to go. "
"7071740","7074000"," Yeah, I reset benefit savers, hands down."
"7074240","7083840"," If you pay your debt down, if you save money, if you're, you know, you live frugally enough, those"
"7083840","7086660"," resets benefit those people, hands down."
"7092110","7095010"," You agree, but you just don't want the value of your properties to decrease. "
"7095010","7098690"," I used to be afraid of that."
"7098990","7102070"," I used to want to flip homes and end flip homes today."
"7102070","7102910"," I don't do that. "
"7102990","7104330"," I own free homes and I'm happy."
"7104650","7105690"," I'm happy where I'm at."
"7105990","7107610"," I'm not a big slum lord. "
"7109170","7111590"," I just perfect where I am right now."
"7113370","7115970"," I'm not concerned with value going down in my homes anymore."
"7116970","7119930"," Whatever those swings in the market is, I really don't care. "
"7120070","7121090"," I'm going to pass all this on to my kids."
"7121090","7124450"," If I can, I don't ruin my life with medical bills when I get older."
"7124690","7125390"," That's my biggest fear. "
"7125590","7126630"," I've been one biggest fear."
"7127630","7129510"," Today, it's probably medical bills."
"7129990","7131290"," It's the one that scares me the most. "
"7132770","7138070"," And I won't try to chase this next generation either."
"7139030","7139650"," As well."
"7139850","7142210"," So I'll stay, I'll stay, I'll stay clear of that stuff if I can. "
"7143050","7148590"," Trying to like keep up with the Joneses and Beverly Hills when I'm 15, 16, 17, 80 and all that"
"7148590","7148870"," stuff."
"7154160","7158180"," Do I, do I think the economy is after next year, we have liquidity coming into the system right"
"7158180","7158480"," now."
"7159800","7165480"," We have a vehicle in the inverted yield or 10 year yields to remove liquidity for the system. "
"7165780","7166740"," That should ain't working right."
"7167280","7170340"," The only other vehicle right now would be a rate cut or a rate increases."
"7170340","7173580"," And we haven't raised rates in five months. "
"7174120","7178040"," So there's money creeping in the system."
"7178200","7180740"," I'm telling you, they did the same thing with the regional banks too."
"7184900","7187520"," They got one, two family and a single family right on. "
"7190180","7191940"," They're doing fiscal STEMI right now."
"7192060","7193540"," They inject money in the system right now."
"7193840","7196680"," I've been doing it all along and call whatever you want to call it. "
"7196680","7200480"," But they've been saving this, saving our system for quite a bit of time."
"7203060","7208160"," The thing that fascinates me is that the thing that fascinates me is."
"7210820","7212720"," The thing that we talk about this, right?"
"7213300","7215000"," Jimmy Barry and I talk about this, right?"
"7215140","7215400"," It's like. "
"7216120","7220020"," Buying time so that you can accept a higher inflation."
"7221520","7224280"," Buying time for wages to be increased."
"7225920","7233820"," So that you can accept that inflation and never and no return to previous prices and a lot of"
"7233820","7234920"," aspects of our lives. "
"7235340","7240500"," The older that you get, you see it price of hamburgers never come back down over the decades and"
"7240500","7243820"," you see it with eggs and hamburgers and whatever it is."
"7244360","7245760"," The rents doesn't matter."
"7246160","7247840"," So that's what it might be. "
"7247880","7248460"," That's what they're doing."
"7248620","7250040"," They're going to declare job done."
"7251020","7255000"," We've got year over year, two percent inflation and your wages are coming up. "
"7255260","7258900"," They're going to do a victory lap and you're going to see higher prices in 10, 20 years."
"7259100","7260000"," You're going to be paying fucking rent."
"7260220","7264100"," That's way higher in 15, 20 years in my view. "
"7264820","7269140"," Unless they pull a Volcker, a retrue Volcker moment, which I don't think that they have the"
"7269140","7270080"," political will to do."
"7270500","7271380"," I don't think they have it."
"7277290","7278830"," Well, wages are going up. "
"7279130","7281010"," If you don't know that, I want to tell you something."
"7281010","7283930"," Some of the data is just starting to come out, but I do want you guys to be aware of"
"7283930","7284250"," something."
"7285210","7286590"," Wages are coming up. "
"7286950","7290630"," If you're young, if you're older, matter of fact, it doesn't matter what age you are."
"7290710","7292550"," I want you to know that wages are coming up."
"7293290","7298930"," You saw renegotiating of wages for airlines of trains. "
"7299210","7301490"," You saw it for shipping."
"7301830","7303270"," You saw it for FedEx UPS."
"7305470","7306950"," You're seeing it all over the place. "
"7307150","7308710"," All kinds of unions, auto workers."
"7309130","7310270"," They're all renegotiating."
"7310270","7318230"," For an eventual increase in wages in the next five, five years to lead into 10 years. "
"7318670","7326630"," You see it in producers and pricing in every aspect of your life, right?"
"7326870","7334710"," So there's a pain moment in this, but down the road, wages will align in the next 10, 15 years"
"7334710","7338410"," to those demands in pricing."
"7342670","7344570"," Well, it's not that they make up 170 soon."
"7344570","7345550"," I think that they start. "
"7345990","7348470"," I think they're on like a four year plan to make that money."
"7350190","7352410"," Now, there are going to be people that get wrecked in this, right?"
"7353310","7354030"," You're going to see."
"7354210","7359310"," I was using this example the other day where I was like, let's say you have wages increasing over"
"7359310","7360270"," the next five, 10 years. "
"7361490","7363810"," You also have a company like McDonald's."
"7364290","7367350"," And what they'll try to do is you matter of fact, here's another aspect too."
"7367350","7370910"," We have 26 states have increased their minimum wage. "
"7371150","7376850"," We have another 24 states with legislation on the books for minimum wage increases."
"7377310","7378910"," And then you've got companies like McDonald's."
"7378970","7382570"," They're going to try to raise your rate or raise your prices now and hold them, right?"
"7382890","7386490"," Max profit on this new debt cycle we're supposedly in. "
"7387130","7391670"," And then they're going to try to squash wages as much as possible because they know that their wage"
"7391670","7393810"," increases are coming in five or 10 years."
"7393810","7399270"," They can't compete with those other companies like UPS for entry level work, but they'll try to"
"7399270","7403410"," push our hammer down wages as long as possible until they actually increase."
"7404430","7409090"," So, yeah, there's going to be some pain there in that time period for a lot of people. "
"7417380","7419320"," Well, engineers is a good point."
"7419620","7420720"," So each bomb is bringing up engineers."
"7421100","7424440"," An engineer prop pre 2019 20. "
"7424860","7426820"," I was averaging about what?"
"7427180","7428900"," 90 to $100,000 a year."
"7429260","7432860"," If you have a two family income, let's do some quick, easy math, right?"
"7433200","7433800"," Let's do like a."
"7434340","7435860"," Let's do like crayon eater math."
"7436520","7438300"," We don't have too much to get this math done, right?"
"7439260","7441860"," If you were if you were a couple. "
"7441860","7446740"," Two guys, you're married to two men, you're married both engineers or two women."
"7446980","7447940"," You're two women that are married."
"7447940","7452380"," You're both engineers, both making about $90 to $120,000 a year, right?"
"7452600","7453440"," It's called a hundred K."
"7454280","7458060"," So as a two person household, you're making $200,000 a year. "
"7458340","7461040"," Pretty comfortable pre 2020, right?"
"7461660","7462900"," Let's talk about today."
"7464200","7469660"," So today, let's say you don't, let's say you both get transferred to California and you don't own a"
"7469660","7474660"," house and you go to, you've got a couple kids too, and you want to rent a house."
"7475520","7481360"," House rentals start right now in desirable areas, $5,000 to $15,000. "
"7481980","7483620"," So you're making $200,000 a year."
"7484880","7486360"," You have to pay what?"
"7487700","7488400"," What is that?"
"7488540","7491500"," $60,000 a year in rent after taxes?"
"7492600","7492840"," That's what?"
"7493040","7496340"," $70,000, $80,000 a year you have to make."
"7496700","7497380"," So imagine that. "
"7497800","7501740"," You're now at a right around 30 to 50% of your dual income."
"7502320","7504240"," So your wages need to go up, don't they?"
"7504240","7506980"," You probably need to make how much?"
"7507340","7515420"," And looking at an entry level UPS worker being promised $150,000, that would mean that if you're an"
"7515420","7521820"," engineer, if you're, if you're such if you're young, you should be looking for no longer $120,000,"
"7522420","7522480"," right?"
"7522480","7524540"," You're now looking to make about what?"
"7525240","7527880"," $200,000, believe it or not, right?"
"7528160","7536900"," But about 270 or, excuse me, 175, 150 to $200,000 so that you can bring that that 25%"
"7536900","7542640"," back to or your, or your housing back down to 25% of your income, right?"
"7542640","7549400"," So 90 to 120,000, you need to make $150,000 to $200,000 right now to maintain that lifestyle."
"7550800","7552680"," What else does that imply though?"
"7553640","7559800"," It implies that if you're making now, if you're an engineer and you're making $150,000 a year in"
"7559800","7561420"," the next five to 10 years, right?"
"7562040","7563720"," Are you actually living better?"
"7564580","7565440"," Probably not. "
"7565820","7569840"," You're living the same as you were making $90,000 to $120,000, right?"
"7570960","7575620"," Your, your, your lifestyle hasn't gotten any better hasn't."
"7576420","7582300"," So if that's the case, right, that your lifestyle is not getting any better and you're making more"
"7582300","7584540"," money, what does that make the stock market?"
"7586120","7588620"," Makes it really cheap right now, doesn't it?"
"7590080","7590780"," Extremely cheap."
"7591520","7597360"," If money becomes cheaper over time and you're, you're, you can already see that businesses are"
"7597360","7602320"," forecasting that even though the Fed is telling you or the Treasury Department is telling you"
"7602320","7603220"," something different. "
"7603480","7607140"," They're in there, you're air telling you that we don't, we're not going there."
"7607280","7608000"," We're not going there."
"7608100","7611400"," We're not going there and you see companies already planning for that to happen. "
"7611400","7620660"," I would go with companies and not the Fed and say in five, 10 years, engineers probably be"
"7620660","7626700"," averaging on the low end 150 on the low end and they're going to expect that demand it."
"7627320","7631040"," So if that's the case, what does that make the stock market right now?"
"7631580","7633040"," Dirt fucking cheap, right?"
"7633920","7636860"," Undervalued, to be honest, right?"
"7636860","7643300"," We're at prices not seen since 2022, five, 10 years, we're cheap, right?"
"7643520","7647280"," We should see that 6,000 with no problems, shouldn't we?"
"7656950","7658770"," Yeah, yeah, exactly thirsty."
"7663020","7668800"," Jimmy Berry saying anyone that bought property in 2020 to 2023, you're about to get hammered. "
"7669640","7677220"," Jimmy, John, John, Joe Donut last night was talking about, about rates going insane for some of"
"7677220","7677880"," those people, right?"
"7679360","7680980"," In the coming months."
"7682680","7688340"," Well, maybe we might have, we might have Joe Donut on this morning to talk about it, but they got,"
"7688400","7691040"," they got still some people and some variable rate arm shit too."
"7691160","7699570"," So what would happen if you cut rates today?"
"7700770","7701350"," That's a good question. "
"7702030","7705830"," If we cut rates today, I would expect a squeeze to the moon for liquidity to sell this shit into"
"7705830","7707590"," the into the depths of hell."
"7708630","7714330"," And I would expect a fucking up following bloodbath means we broke something, bro."
"7727570","7731430"," Yeah, if I was an engineer right now, I would be seeking out new employment. "
"7731670","7735510"," If you're, or if you're any, whatever job you're in, you should be renegotiating."
"7735930","7740530"," You've had an opportunity the past couple of years to do that, and I would be doing that right now."
"7741870","7743950"," I'd be doing that right now if possible. "
"7748050","7751490"," Coming down into checking the half hour trigger."
"7752770","7753730"," On spoos."
"7755970","7757730"," Now you want to know my positioning today. "
"7757870","7760670"," I've got a, I've got a put back spread of the markets."
"7762230","7763790"," That expires in June."
"7764210","7767450"," I still have not cut the upside loose loose of that trade. "
"7768210","7770930"," I'm still still on that trade in full at this point."
"7771750","7777570"," I'm sitting on some zero, eight puts and zero, eight calls, whatever the move is in the market"
"7777570","7778550"," today up or down."
"7778550","7779290"," I really don't care. "
"7779390","7782790"," I should get a print more so than what I paid for the entire trade."
"7783490","7784170"," What else?"
"7785550","7787230"," I'm looking for a move though today."
"7787610","7790230"," One way or another to that downside or that upside. "
"7790430","7790810"," I don't care."
"7799330","7799930"," Hold on."
"7800010","7801870"," You guys are blazing through comments right now. "
"7804450","7806070"," I'm missing a bunch of comments."
"7812850","7817550"," Another issue I see is that engineers and developer landscape is pretty saturated with workers"
"7817550","7819210"," right now with so many companies laying them off."
"7819430","7821810"," Whereas entry level and hourly jobs are dying for workers. "
"7823730","7830470"," The one thing I would say about this that you should see is you should see older workers that are"
"7830470","7832210"," overpaid get cut from the system."
"7833050","7837830"," They'll get laid off and then you'll be looking for those jobs to be filled with lower wages from"
"7837830","7838910"," young engineers."
"7843770","7844770"," What else we got here?"
"7847170","7848710"," We're putting rip it, tag it, and bag it. "
"7849690","7851850"," Look at Brock seeing that my company."
"7852310","7854350"," Darth Molly's saying 100% seeing that my company."
"7855090","7856170"," That's what I would be doing. "
"7856950","7861790"," We figure if you have a tighter job market, an actual tighter job market, I'd be trying to."
"7862470","7865470"," Like if I got some this horrible to say, because I'm this age, right?"
"7865470","7871030"," If you're an engineer and you're 50 years old and you're maxed out with pay."
"7871850","7874950"," I really don't want you at this point in this side part of the cycle, right?"
"7875050","7879670"," I want to hire someone cheaper, someone younger and cheaper. "
"7880730","7885930"," So you're probably going to get offered severance of buyout, whatever that is right around now."
"7886350","7887910"," So I'd be looking for those jobs if possible."
"7888670","7894250"," If you're young and then if you're older, before this actually happens, if you can secure yourself"
"7894250","7896930"," a position with a higher rate of pay, I'd be on that too. "
"7897330","7899190"," Make a jump higher in what you're doing."
"7907120","7913980"," Cap, if you have small children and cards and learn skills, what jobs skills do you foresee to be"
"7913980","7914660"," the way of the future?"
"7915820","7922320"," So my children, I teach them a lot of stuff that kids missed today."
"7923640","7924980"," A hands-on stuff. "
"7925770","7929920"," My daughters helped me fix my cars, believe it or not, my daughters."
"7930500","7934660"," You guys already know I ski, hike, bike, ride bicycles, all that stuff, surf."
"7937660","7939580"," Like the touch and grass type stuff. "
"7940180","7945060"," As far as schooling, my oldest daughter is an honor student."
"7945640","7951760"," She's very smart, stupid smart, and we just had a discussion recently."
"7951760","7955220"," About six months ago, we're discussing college education. "
"7956200","7959560"," And what I asked her was, she wants to be a doctor."
"7960080","7965480"," And I was like, you know, it'd be great for you to get a medical degree in four years that"
"7965480","7970500"," you can get paid with immediately and then make a decision if you want to go to medical school"
"7970500","7971120"," after that."
"7972500","7974100"," Something tangible that pays. "
"7975240","7982600"," I talked to her about becoming an anesthesiologist or something like that, right out of a four-year"
"7982600","7982860"," school."
"7983940","7987780"," I'm like, I'd like to see her become a nurse or something, like a four-year bachelor's as a nurse,"
"7988080","7989260"," something like that, then become a nurse practitioner."
"7990420","7994180"," But she wants to be a doctor, so it'll probably not do what I want her to do. "
"7995220","7998140"," But skills and stuff like that, stay off the fucking phones."
"7999880","8001200"," Stay off the fuck with the kids."
"8001440","8002080"," Stay off the fucking phones. "
"8002440","8002980"," Phones are bad."
"8003740","8004520"," Phones are terrible."
"8004940","8005840"," iPads are terrible. "
"8006000","8006760"," Computers are terrible."
"8007460","8009740"," When they're young, you want to get them out there experiencing real stuff."
"8011280","8013400"," They look so awkward when they don't. "
"8013540","8014120"," You can see kids."
"8014560","8018500"," I don't know if I should say that, but I see kids that sometimes you're like, oh, that kid doesn't"
"8018500","8019280"," spend a lot of time outside."
"8020040","8021780"," It's okay if they're awkward, but that's what it is. "
"8022460","8023480"," So I want them to have that experience."
"8023740","8026960"," They don't get sucked into that adult life of not getting outside."
"8036320","8037700"," Private School of Public School. "
"8037960","8041600"," So I moved to Detroit from a very nice place out west."
"8042920","8045340"," So we don't have a lot of choice for schools here."
"8045420","8047020"," So our kids are in private school. "
"8047740","8049660"," Both our kids were in private online."
"8050560","8054680"," In present teacher prior to COVID, slightly prior to COVID."
"8055020","8059020"," We're already signed up for it because we like to sail, but that's how we got in. "
"8059560","8061900"," But we still do private school for our kids."
"8061900","8063740"," It's a requirement here."
"8063900","8064620"," I don't have a choice. "
"8065480","8066480"," Public schools here."
"8067280","8068580"," Not where they need to be."
"8068780","8069380"," They're getting better. "
"8069600","8071260"," They're just still not where they need to be."
"8075400","8078240"," You're never a fan of private schools until I get going to school."
"8078560","8078680"," Yeah. "
"8080580","8081840"," Even with private school."
"8082020","8082760"," I'll be honest with you guys."
"8083260","8089680"," I don't think even with private school, we spend a lot of time with our kids teaching them outside"
"8089680","8090580"," of regular school. "
"8091320","8093100"," I'm not even happy with private school."
"8093100","8099600"," There's an aspect of this thing today with kids where everyone graduates."
"8100400","8107700"," And as a parent, you've got to spend that hour, two, three hours. "
"8108000","8109400"," I want to say something about that if I can."
"8110920","8116620"," If you have young kids, okay, these teachers are not going to tell you if your kid's falling"
"8116620","8117060"," behind."
"8117740","8122480"," And my biggest fear for my girls is that. "
"8123160","8125260"," Like they get into fifth grade, right?"
"8125820","8128580"," And they just slide by."
"8128980","8130480"," They're not causing problems for teachers."
"8131200","8133740"," They're not, they're not on the radar of anybody. "
"8134780","8141580"," They start to fall behind slowly as their work becomes more complicated and progresses and they"
"8141580","8142520"," begin to fall behind."
"8142520","8146620"," And not until they're in seventh, eighth, ninth or leading into ninth grade."
"8146620","8150720"," You find out that they're not prepared for high school. "
"8151420","8153560"," I don't care what a kid's going to do in life."
"8153740","8157120"," I don't care the child's going to be swinging a hammer."
"8157300","8159400"," I don't care if a kid's going to be a doctor. "
"8160000","8161120"," I don't care what you're going to be."
"8161760","8167800"," But there's that base education for kids where you want them to have that."
"8167800","8170760"," You want them to learn this, a learning environment, right?"
"8170840","8174540"," It's the time in their life for them to learn to learn how to learn to. "
"8174960","8176720"," So that's my biggest fear with our kids."
"8177240","8184720"," And the only way that I found around that problem is that I care most about what they actually"
"8184720","8185440"," understand."
"8186280","8186360"," Right?"
"8186800","8188800"," So hey, do you understand these concepts?"
"8189520","8195860"," If you don't understand these concepts, let's learn them together in spending that quality time. "
"8195860","8198760"," It's great relationship building with you and your kids."
"8199280","8201040"," And it is the difference."
"8201680","8205059"," And that doesn't matter if kid's smart, doesn't matter if kid has learning disability. "
"8206040","8211740"," You spend that time in learning those concepts and that kid to understand that child to understand"
"8211740","8214660"," those concepts is huge."
"8215280","8219080"," And a huge difference maker for them in life."
"8219940","8224799"," It really is critical thinking is a game changer for a child, right?"
"8226139","8227860"," Teaching a child how to write an essay. "
"8228379","8232980"," Like your school might review it with them and give them a passing grade."
"8233320","8236820"," But how do you really have to teach that to your own child?"
"8237879","8239299"," It's important, right?"
"8240160","8246700"," So they can understand a form and opinion, argue against themselves and then present their points"
"8246700","8250260"," for why something should be something."
"8251299","8252680"," Be able to defend their thesis. "
"8252680","8260299"," Make a thesis, defend it, address counter arguments against their thesis."
"8261440","8262680"," All that stuff is important."
"8262860","8263660"," I don't care if you're swinging a hammer. "
"8263900","8265660"," You still need that stuff in life."
"8266879","8268639"," So anyways, sorry for the rant."
"8278910","8282969"," I think parents are a key part. "
"8283170","8287070"," Grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends of the family, whoever that is."
"8287070","8291549"," To have a place for that kid in their lives."
"8291549","8292190"," It's important. "
"8293530","8294389"," It's tiring."
"8295150","8296030"," You guys see me."
"8296290","8297330"," I'm tired all the time. "
"8298010","8299530"," I get pulled."
"8299850","8300590"," My wife gets pulled."
"8300750","8303910"," My wife and I, some of our close friends is Joe down it. "
"8304150","8304629"," It's not."
"8305209","8306809"," You're just like always running."
"8307389","8312730"," It's always run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run from work, run from family"
"8312730","8314350"," commitments, house commitments. "
"8316590","8317330"," I don't know."
"8317469","8318950"," Last night I was working on a furnace."
"8319370","8322250"," Every year I got to do maintenance on a furnace to pay. "
"8322350","8325590"," I was doing it myself late night last night."
"8327370","8329410"," It's always a fire somewhere."
"8330690","8333650"," Money doesn't matter in that stuff if you really care about your family. "
"8334570","8335170"," It's all the same."
"8335370","8339370"," You all choose on the same way, pants on the same way, shirts on the same way."
"8339370","8340670"," Same way you're all taking shits the same way. "
"8341209","8343170"," Well, some of you, you get to make too much money."
"8343350","8344350"," You don't do certain things."
"8344510","8346030"," Some of you don't make enough money. "
"8346030","8346690"," You have to do more."
"8360420","8362940"," You're saying they book baby kids in private school more?"
"8363400","8364080"," I don't know."
"8364219","8366719"," My kids teachers are not nice. "
"8367760","8370299"," They hold a pretty high standard for my kids."
"8370780","8371860"," They have to work hard."
"8373200","8374080"," It's brutal. "
"8374420","8375260"," Maybe it is when they're younger."
"8375879","8377900"," My youngest daughter is now in fifth grade."
"8378200","8380459"," My oldest daughter is now a junior in high school. "
"8381000","8383940"," I got a fifth grader and I got a junior in high school."
"8387280","8389780"," I felt like they were like that with my fifth graders."
"8390240","8392620"," Or my fifth grader, but before fifth grade they were like that. "
"8393160","8397880"," The fifth grade, I feel like they start to have higher expectations out of them."
"8398980","8400360"," Maybe you're talking about discovery."
"8401140","8403920"," They have better discovery in private schools, possibly kids. "
"8404740","8405700"," That might be the case."
"8407980","8410680"," I noticed that fifth grade it's like we're on."
"8411000","8411900"," We're live here. "
"8412480","8414580"," Your expectations are higher if you're a child."
"8417180","8418360"," Yeah, he's in grade six."
"8419260","8420180"," You're tough on your kids. "
"8421520","8422460"," I try to be."
"8423460","8425080"," My wife is tough on my daughters."
"8426020","8426560"," I'm not. "
"8427500","8429040"," I don't know if that's a function of."
"8429640","8433260"," I don't know what function that is."
"8434140","8434980"," Daddy's little girl. "
"8434980","8435500"," I don't know."
"8436620","8439180"," When I was growing up, my dad was hard on me."
"8439260","8440920"," My mom was easier on me. "
"8441900","8445500"," And those roles are reversed with my daughters."
"8449160","8450720"," I'm a little bit softer on them."
"8451300","8451800"," I'll be honest. "
"8456560","8457440"," Yeah, same for you."
"8457620","8458560"," Yeah, my wife is brutal."
"8459760","8462200"," My wife does not fuck around with our daughters. "
"8470640","8474940"," My wife is high expectations with kids."
"8477280","8478760"," Yeah, you play it exactly."
"8479420","8482320"," Different roles, different people, different needs. "
"8483980","8486240"," The one thing I do notice to my daughters is that."
"8488560","8490500"," They don't want to disappoint me."
"8491660","8493460"," I'm not hard on them, so it's weird. "
"8493940","8496060"," If they do something wrong and disappoint me."
"8498120","8499780"," Just the look on my face."
"8500480","8501840"," It's like I smacked them or something. "
"8503000","8504120"," I don't even have to touch them."
"8505060","8506220"," My wife's never touched them either."
"8506480","8507820"," We don't do that shit to our kids, but. "
"8509920","8512100"," For some reason, disappointment is."
"8513080","8518380"," Even if I'm not disappointed, just the thought that I'm disappointed is enough for my daughters."
"8536410","8537370"," Yeah, parental approval. "
"8537890","8540730"," We just, my wife and I decided a discussion about this the other day."
"8542630","8546330"," What we'll do, what we're willing to do as they become adults and all that kind of stuff."
"8547090","8548450"," I'll always be there for my kids. "
"8550570","8551810"," We play family."
"8552770","8554190"," Like, we're not just mom and dad."
"8554470","8556610"," We involve our kids and everything that we do. "
"8556950","8558130"," We made that decision."
"8558330","8558630"," We had them."
"8558730","8559890"," We wanted our kids in our life. "
"8559890","8563670"," We wanted to show them how life has been for us."
"8564250","8566810"," So we include our children in most things that we do."
"8567550","8569010"," Incorporate our kids into our lives. "
"8571730","8573350"," Okay, so they're parking it right now."
"8573390","8574130"," Not too much going on."
"8574290","8575550"," Twelve, forty-six. "
"8576490","8581390"," Awaiting a decision at two p.m. We're going to make a trip around the market here and take a"
"8581390","8582150"," look at some of the sectors."
"8583710","8586830"," We've got HYG squeezing up on the day."
"8587790","8590030"," Still looking bullish on a 15 minute basis. "
"8592530","8596590"," Though we do have a role in the one minute basis, we do just the heads up here in this"
"8596590","8596770"," role."
"8596770","8599970"," We've got a bearish, a bear plane on the one minute trigger."
"8600190","8607550"," We have a giant gap down below to close at 75.85. The VIX on the 15 minute is looking"
"8607550","8614610"," quite bullish on the one minute squeezing higher now, trading $12.40, telegraphing the volatility"
"8614610","8616330"," into the market today. "
"8616330","8626310"," On the rate decision, we've got Apple blasting down, trading $195.58. Seems like"
"8626310","8626690"," it's waiting."
"8627390","8634170"," Dixie on the daily chart looks like it's awaiting the decision as well."
"8636490","8642250"," NASDAQ trading $16.3.74, I believe, getting old. "
"8642470","8643230"," My eyesight sucks."
"8644290","8653750"," They've got a gap to close down below to $16.340. Looks like there's also a buffer on NASDAQ"
"8653750","8658590"," as people want to see that $16,000 level hold."
"8660090","8664490"," So downside expectation on NASDAQ today looks like $16,000. "
"8664890","8668330"," A possible 300 point move to the downside as a buffer."
"8669210","8673530"," TNX looks like it's sitting there parked awaiting a decision as well."
"8673790","8675490"," So not too much to read here. "
"8675530","8680190"," It looks like the market is just getting positioned for Jerome Powell today."
"8681730","8683570"," So I don't see too much here in the background."
"8686470","8687310"," Some news. "
"8688070","8693170"," Wall Street, solid mining movements up in the market, run up into the Federal Reserve decision with"
"8693170","8697490"," the disappointing inflation data reinforcing speculation that policymakers will be slow to declare"
"8697490","8697750"," victory."
"8698510","8701710"," Wall markets remain confident that officials remain on hold on Wednesday."
"8702070","8706530"," The latest data calls into question, the aggressive pricing of a Davish pivot. "
"8706930","8710990"," Traitors have slightly reduced their bets on rate cuts in 2024."
"8711990","8718750"," With the first still expected in May, the data also fueled speculation that Fed Chairman Jerome"
"8718750","8723350"," Powell will try to deflate the Fed's easing buoyancy."
"8724230","8730490"," Following the last rate decision, Powell reminded investors that inflation will come in lumps and"
"8730490","8737330"," be bumpy in the fact that Tuesday's consumer price index was roughly in line with expectations and"
"8737330","8744050"," ticked up slightly highlighted the choppy nature of returning prices to the 2% target, particularly"
"8744050","8750490"," in the service sector which the Fed has targeted as the final mile in its inflation fight. "
"8751590","8752490"," Key point here."
"8753470","8755490"," We'll read that to you one more time."
"8756090","8762390"," Following the last Fed decision, Powell reminded investors that inflation will quote, come in lumps"
"8762390","8763830"," and be bumpy end quote. "
"8764850","8771430"," The fact that Tuesday's consumer price index was roughly in line with expectations and ticked up"
"8771430","8780570"," slightly highlighted the choppy nature of returning prices to the 2% target, particularly in the"
"8780570","8787050"," service sector, which the Fed has targeted as the final mile in its inflation fight."
"8787770","8793190"," So that should be something you should be aware and keyed into in the coming months ahead."
"8794130","8800710"," After spiking in the aftermath of the CPI report, two year yields have stabilized above 4.7%. Long "
"8800710","8805550","-term treasuries rose slightly after a $21 billion sale of 30-year bonds drew strong demand. "
"8808290","8812290"," The VIX, the Wall Street Speargage, fell to a four-year load."
"8814790","8817250"," Yeah, I want to see a trader podcasting."
"8818050","8819130"," You know what I'm really excited about?"
"8819390","8822010"," New video of J-POW is base for deep fakes. "
"8822470","8823150"," Els, yes."
"8824310","8825370"," What else we have here?"
"8825890","8827130"," I'll read some more stuff to you."
"8828150","8829390"," That's Asian stocks. "
"8830310","8831170"," UK GDP."
"8832190","8834130"," Let me see if I can find anything else for you here."
"8839050","8841410"," Yellen, this morning, some highlights from Yellen. "
"8842010","8846790"," She had said this morning I see a consistent pattern of inflation coming down over time."
"8847330","8852870"," I expect inflation to continue to come down in inflation rates beginning with the numeral two by"
"8852870","8854990"," end of 2024."
"8858170","8859250"," Did you read that?"
"8859470","8865070"," I expect inflation to continue to come down in inflation rates beginning with the numeral two by"
"8865070","8865850"," the end of 2024. "
"8866870","8873730"," She also says we are likely to reach inflation in two percent range at end of 2024."
"8873830","8875310"," That makes sense to me."
"8875730","8879330"," If we get inflation now that two percent, we get unemployment up to about six or eight percent. "
"8879330","8883910"," We should be front running the rate cuts into the end of 2024."
"8884070","8888630"," That would mean maybe a two or three month head start in June or so."
"8888990","8891310"," June or July to start looking for that front running. "
"8892030","8897110"," There are risks on the horizon, but I don't see the risk of recession as particularly high."
"8897710","8903010"," She also says the Biden administration is likely to revive proposals for higher corporate tax rates"
"8903010","8903570"," next year."
"8904330","8905530"," That's an interesting point. "
"8905590","8906550"," That's an interesting point."
"8906550","8914930"," That's another sign of the tail end of a short term debt cycle where the government attempts to"
"8914930","8918010"," remove more money out of the system by taxing corporations."
"8918770","8921050"," You usually see three or four of these signs. "
"8921290","8923990"," The first one would be civil unrest in your country."
"8924610","8929470"," The next one would be taxing corporations and the other one would be war or the possibility of war"
"8929470","8932870"," of war proxy through other countries."
"8933310","8935550"," We know that we have proxy wars raging around the world. "
"8935550","8941350"," We know that we've had civil unrest in the United States, so these higher corporate taxes are not"
"8941350","8942110"," unexpected."
"8943890","8945130"," What else do we have here?"
"8946010","8949330"," The Middle East war has the potential to affect the global economy."
"8949690","8956150"," If it expands, she says that's painting back to that war talk that I just spoke to you about. "
"8956930","8958610"," Then that's all I've got for Yellen."
"8958890","8963130"," Apple is set to be hit by an EU antitrust order in its fight with Spotify."
"8964230","8970910"," The SEC votes 4 to 1 to adopt new central clearing rules for $26 trillion U.S. Treasury market. "
"8971770","8977230"," And NATO increases its military budget $2.2 billion, so I've got for you right now from that news"
"8977230","8977550"," source."
"8979270","8987310"," Again, today we have the FOMC rate decision at 2 p.m. We have Fed Chair Powell presser at 2"
"8987310","8992290"," 30 p.m. Do not forget that tomorrow morning at 8 30 we have claims."
"8992290","8994490"," We have the import price index. "
"8995130","9000170"," We've got U.S. retail sales and minus autos as well at 8 30 in the morning."
"9000330","9005090"," We have inventories at 10 business inventories at 10 p.m. Then Friday we've got the Empire State"
"9005090","9009170"," Manufacturing Survey, Industrial Production and capacity utilization."
"9010010","9014790"," Next week we have home builder confidence index on Monday at 10. "
"9015330","9018850"," We have housing starts and building permits at 8 30 on Tuesday."
"9018850","9023150"," So that's that whole discussion you see people discussing the housing market."
"9023210","9025650"," So we have some big news on Monday and Tuesday on that. "
"9026350","9029690"," And then we've got existing home sales on Wednesday as well."
"9030030","9034150"," Then we move into later in the week next week on the 21st, 22nd."
"9034610","9040290"," We've got claims GDP, Philly Fed, leading income indicators, durable goods on Friday. "
"9041610","9044350"," PCI, PCE that kind of stuff into a Friday of next week."
"9044530","9048350"," So get some a little bit of volatility heading into the 22nd."
"9050890","9052050"," Give me just a moment here. "
"9052130","9054290"," I'm going to take a quick break as we head into the one o'clock hour."
"9054750","9059130"," I need to set up a feed so we can get the live press around the stream here."
"9059790","9063130"," So I'll be back with you guys at 1 p.m. The stream will stay up and on. "
"9063730","9067930"," Feel free to discuss and chat and give me just about 5 or 10 minutes."
"9067930","9068890"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"9098490","9098970"," All right. "
"9099070","9099490"," What's the setup?"
"9099650","9101190"," Adobe reports and OT."
"9103650","9105110"," Set up on Adobe with me."
"9105410","9107590"," Yeah, I just Steve, you know, Steve makes me laugh sometimes. "
"9107730","9108170"," I just apologize."
"9109030","9109950"," Um, generative AI."
"9110250","9111370"," That's going to have to be the story. "
"9111770","9112130"," Firefly."
"9112650","9114550"," What is it going to be monetized?"
"9114550","9117610"," Twenty twenty four conservative guidance."
"9118210","9123430"," Might be what holds back the stock from advancing to the November of twenty twenty one high at six"
"9123430","9124010"," ninety nine. "
"9124190","9124470"," Brynn."
"9125110","9126310"," You say you wish you owned it."
"9127530","9132690"," Yeah, you know, if you actually go back decades, most stocks don't even outperform the 90 day TV. "
"9133050","9134590"," Much less the S&P."
"9135190","9136150"," Adobe Costco."
"9136170","9137030"," There's a few names. "
"9137030","9140670"," I mean, Adobe has recurring revenue to Joe's point."
"9140890","9143810"," They're in the thick of AI, which they will monetize."
"9143810","9147370"," And so it's they have this flywheel, but I think they'll continue to be a winner. "
"9147830","9151010"," I own the queues, so yes, and it's in the top ten, so I own it."
"9151190","9153610"," But I would love to have owned this name years ago."
"9153990","9154270"," All right. "
"9154550","9155850"," Finals right after this break."
"9322280","9326520"," We've got a big closing bell, of course, right after the Fed Chair finishes with the news"
"9326520","9326960"," conference."
"9327260","9330240"," Jeffrey Gunlock of Double Line is going to join us in a CMBC exclusive. "
"9330240","9331760"," It's our last visit of the year."
"9332480","9337660"," Very much looking forward to what he has to say about what might happen today and what could happen"
"9337660","9338720"," next, most importantly."
"9338940","9340300"," So we'll see you three o'clock this afternoon. "
"9340500","9341760"," Josh Brown lives young with me too."
"9341880","9342800"," Brynn, what's your final trade?"
"9343760","9347340"," O.I.L.K. attracts the front-month oil futures contracts."
"9347820","9349780"," It's a trade-only if it doesn't work out in the next month. "
"9350180","9350340"," Sell it."
"9350740","9351580"," It's K-1 free."
"9352180","9355460"," I think oil is a technical support, so we get a nice bounce over the next few weeks. "
"9355780","9356720"," Thank you, Steve Weiss."
"9357180","9360260"," I'm Ryan Momentum, and you manage should recover everything you lost."
"9360580","9360880"," Sarat. "
"9361220","9364680"," Amex, I think you're going to see much more spending for millennials going to help it."
"9364800","9365040"," Alright."
"9365280","9365720"," Joey T."
"9366080","9369780"," In honor of my good friend Stephen Weiss, Eli Lilly continues to push higher. "
"9370160","9374160"," Okay, so we got the S&P, we got the Dow, the Nasdaq are higher yields."
"9374540","9377040"," They fell today, all leading up to what happens in just a little bit."
"9377160","9378140"," The exchange is right now. "
"9383320","9385520"," Thank you, Scott, and welcome to The Exchange."
"9386320","9386900"," I'm Kelly Evans."
"9387160","9388220"," Here's what's ahead this hour. "
"9388600","9391540"," An hour from now we get the latest Fed decision on interest rates."
"9391740","9393020"," Stocks are in a holding pattern."
"9393200","9396180"," As you can see ahead of that announcement, that was literally at 15 points. "
"9396660","9401220"," Bond yields are slightly down though, especially after that cooler than expected producer price"
"9401220","9402060"," data this morning."
"9402560","9406920"," The market is pricing in a full point of cuts next year as inflation has receded rapidly."
"9407660","9410260"," Will Chair Powell push back on that today or not?"
"9410560","9415100"," Let's start there with full team coverage on the economy, the consumer, and the trades connected to"
"9415100","9416040"," the Fed's actions today. "
"9416240","9417500"," There's our whole roster of guests."
"9417960","9422120"," Let's start with CNBC senior economic supporter Steve Leisman in Washington."
"9422640","9423920"," Steve, what's the scuttle button?"
"9424560","9427980"," Well, I think the Fed meeting today pitched the market's desire. "
"9428600","9431160"," It's only back in just a few minutes, not a full hour."
"9431320","9432180"," Just a few minutes."
"9432180","9433720"," I got some stuff I got to set up in the background. "
"9437220","9442180"," So it'll probably leave in the statement, the language where it's been signaling its bias to hike"
"9442180","9446840"," saying it's still determining the extent of additional policy forming that may be appropriate."
"9446840","9452000"," It'll keep that even while it's going to have been on hold for four months through today's meeting"
"9452000","9456080"," and six months until that meeting happens in January."
"9456740","9459380"," It signals its neutral, its bias to hike in that. "
"9459540","9464900"," But it also signals its bias to hike in the rates that the dot pod that it has."
"9465220","9467740"," 12 had forecast an additional rate hike this year."
"9468380","9469460"," Some of that may go away. "
"9469780","9472920"," 13 forecast cuts from that level in 2024."
"9473880","9475200"," Average cuts of half a point."
"9475200","9477440"," Some of that may go away as well. "
"9477640","9482540"," The trouble for the Fed is inflation is falling everywhere, but in that core CPI we got yesterday."
"9483040","9483760"," It's falling globally."
"9484280","9488460"," It's in today's PPI and it's already prompting forecasts to predict progress. "
"9488980","9491940"," In next week's PCE defense preferred inflation indicator."
"9492180","9496000"," All that's to say the market expectation for cuts is also data dependent."
"9496080","9498720"," They're looking for it's a 46% probability of a cut. "
"9498920","9503520"," March 81% come May and darn certainty in June with 95% probability."
"9504060","9505820"," But markets will invent that eventually."
"9506360","9508560"," The Fed and Chair Powell see what it sees about inflation. "
"9509260","9512040"," There's time yet for the markets and the Fed to come together on all this."
"9512840","9517420"," And even a grudging acknowledgement may be today that if everything goes right for several months,"
"9517980","9518980"," then yeah, the Fed will cut."
"9519140","9519520"," We'll see Kelly. "
"9519860","9522920"," I'm looking Steve for the date on when we're going to get PCE."
"9523080","9524120"," Could this be right?"
"9524400","9525140"," December 22."
"9525960","9526840"," December 22. "
"9527120","9531120"," Part of that data dump that we get before the holidays every year."
"9532140","9536080"," So the economic report could not take their Friday off before Christmas."
"9536380","9536760"," Never. "
"9537020","9539680"," And I think the significance of that a couple of things."
"9539860","9544300"," Number one PPI this morning has everyone revising down what they think that all-important reading"
"9544300","9545160"," will be for the Fed."
"9545360","9551020"," And as Nick Timrose kind of points out today, core PCE, which we call the Fed's target, is 1.9 "
"9551020","9552880","% over the past six months already. "
"9553060","9554260"," So you could argue there below target."
"9555140","9555660"," It could be."
"9555840","9558160"," I mean, next week could come in right at that 2% target. "
"9558160","9558580"," We'll see."
"9559100","9561360"," Even for the year over year, forget the three month annualize."
"9561440","9562260"," It could be lower than that. "
"9562580","9566080"," The other thing I've been looking at, Kelly, I know you want to get to the panel, is look at"
"9566080","9567500"," a CPI X shelter."
"9568140","9570260"," It's down below 2% for several months now."
"9570520","9570820"," Wow. "
"9571440","9571800"," Interesting."
"9572200","9572300"," All right."
"9572460","9573480"," As you said, let's do it. "
"9573560","9574240"," Stay with us, Steve."
"9574620","9578900"," The market is hoping for both the soft landing and rate cuts next year on this following inflation."
"9579320","9581000"," But how likely is that to actually happen?"
"9581620","9588420"," Sarah Eisen asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the former President of the United States. "
"9588540","9597260"," My baseline is that we'll achieve a soft landing or the risks, of course, there are risks."
"9598500","9605840"," We could experience another global shock that could be unsettling to that path that could drill"
"9605840","9610320"," inflation upwards or have adverse effects on the economy."
"9611160","9615220"," Well, one of my next guests is still seeing some bigger risks than that and is calling for a"
"9615220","9617980"," recession in 2024, maybe a little bit more. "
"9617980","9621220"," Let's bring in Subaja Rajapa, head of U.S. rate strategy at society general."
"9621680","9625340"," We also have Stephen Whiting, chief investment strategist at city global wealth management"
"9625340","9626000"," investments."
"9626000","9627160"," Welcome to both of you. "
"9627600","9630280"," Subaja, you guys have the recession call?"
"9638340","9639040"," We do."
"9639300","9642700"," We have a recession pencil for the middle of 2024."
"9644080","9648240"," And I think that you're going to, we think that it's going to be a mild recession. "
"9648240","9655200"," And the Fed is probably going to have to act aggressively starting as early as the main meeting."
"9655400","9661620"," We have about 150 basis points of cuts penciled in for 2024 and more in 2025."
"9662660","9671680"," So we do think that this ultimately might end up being a very normal usual type of rate cut cycle. "
"9672220","9677460"," And, you know, in this sort of context, I think that the Fed probably sounds a little bit more"
"9677460","9678440"," hawkish."
"9678640","9682800"," There's no rush for the Fed to suggest that they're going to cut rates."
"9683180","9687540"," So we're pushing back on the market pricing of cuts for the March meeting. "
"9688060","9690000"," But a main rate cut seems very possible."
"9690340","9692960"," Steve Whiting, I missed the CPI data yesterday."
"9693180","9695740"," I heard people saying it was a little bit on the hot end. "
"9696120","9697700"," Again, talk me through that."
"9697780","9699780"," Is that report carrying more weight?"
"9700000","9704060"," Do you think it could be a really dovish PCE report that could be to come?"
"9704060","9708300"," And let me just point out, this is going to break our new graphics back there."
"9708500","9714560"," But the five-year break-even inflation rate, 2.08% right now, Steve Whiting. "
"9714920","9720540"," That means the market almost has a missing their target to the downside right now before we even"
"9720540","9722480"," price in any real economic slowdown."
"9723160","9728640"," You know, other than the recession call, we're all talking about really highly tactical, tiny,"
"9728660","9733200"," little insignificant shifts in the history of the story that we're going to be talking about."
"9733500","9738980"," I mean, central banks generally cared about inflation targets whether they hit them over the course"
"9738980","9739480"," of a decade. "
"9740040","9743020"," You know, let's look back at the period after the global financial crisis."
"9743060","9745020"," Well, we were below target for that decade."
"9745020","9749080"," Now they're talking about whether or not we should adjust monetary policy a little bit up or down"
"9749080","9750980"," based on a CPI report. "
"9750980","9753840"," I don't think that that's really what's going on."
"9754280","9755740"," So we've been managed."
"9755820","9761120"," We've managed now to take inflation from 9% at the headline level down to 3% at a headline"
"9761120","9761620"," level. "
"9761620","9762940"," And there have been no jobs lost."
"9763680","9767120"," And the labor market has shown signs of easing on the margins."
"9767740","9770040"," I've lost 3.3 million job openings. "
"9771160","9777460"," But by and large, again, this has shown that supply shocks upheaval and supply and demand"
"9777460","9780960"," mismatches really generated the inflation the last couple of years."
"9781480","9786060"," Now, we can talk about the economy, but does the federal reserve need to punish the account index?"
"9786240","9792120"," Again, the employment rate to get the inflation rate down to something that will look like target"
"9792120","9793000"," in the next few years."
"9793420","9794680"," And we don't think that's the case. "
"9795000","9800500"," We think that the case is very clear here that a slowing in the labor market will be enough for"
"9800500","9803680"," them to move off of restrictive monetary policy a bit towards neutral."
"9804440","9809820"," I bear in mind in 10 of the last easing cycles, the federal reserve cut rates while employment"
"9809820","9810860"," growth was still positive."
"9811460","9816120"," And the six month average was 146,000 jobs in that whole period. "
"9816420","9817660"," We're including the Volcker Fed."
"9818140","9820280"," So, Steve, why did you just fall up on that real quickly?"
"9820580","9822360"," What do you think Powell is going to try to say today?"
"9823260","9829020"," Well, I think he's going to say the Fed is still uncertain whether they've tightened sufficiently"
"9829020","9833240"," to guarantee that they will meet their inflation target."
"9833680","9837900"," And it's, of course, as Steve Lisa just said, you know, again, reinforcing their recent message. "
"9838560","9843220"," And all of that is fine because they can never be absolutely certain that they're going to hit"
"9843220","9844040"," their inflation target."
"9844040","9848820"," But will he also in questioning, again, entertain what does it take?"
"9849060","9853260"," Why would we be easing monetary policy without a collapse in the economy?"
"9853700","9855260"," What will it take to protect the economy?"
"9855700","9861800"," I think, though, Steve, Lisa, that the market's off to the races, you know, that's kind of what I"
"9861800","9864660"," was saying there with that five-year break in, which is extraordinary."
"9865240","9866600"," You know, they're pricing in a point of cuts. "
"9866840","9869700"," And they're not even really pricing in an economic slowdown."
"9869700","9873420"," This really seems to be a disinflationary loosening."
"9874920","9878960"," Yeah, I mean, didn't Taylor Swift saying doves going to doves or something like that?"
"9879380","9881740"," I think those were the exact words that she used. "
"9882640","9885420"," The market's going to price in what the market's going to price in."
"9885500","9889600"," And I think, as I try to indicate in my report, Kelly, I think they have a basis for it,"
"9889680","9894660"," that when you look into the data, that there is reason for them to believe the Federal Reserve will"
"9894660","9895120"," cut rates."
"9895380","9897860"," And in a sense, it's kind of funny to say this. "
"9897860","9902440"," It's almost academic if Powell acknowledges it today or not."
"9902620","9907020"," If we have posted out the U.S. interest rate prep document on the feed for all those interested."
"9907780","9912840"," The pause, the rate hike, and then the pause, pause, and then what will amount to another pause"
"9912840","9913260"," today. "
"9913900","9918140"," And the next time you're going to have an input is the end of January, it's going to be at"
"9918140","9923780"," that level where you would think for six months or so, if you're at a level, you should be at"
"9923780","9925060"," least close to being confident."
"9925060","9927180"," You're at the sufficiently restrictive level."
"9927440","9929220"," So let's call it what it is. "
"9929300","9930740"," Let's call it neutral."
"9931300","9932820"," That's where the Fed is right now."
"9933320","9937720"," I don't think there's any reason for it to be hiking anytime soon, not if the data breaks the way"
"9937720","9941540"," the data looks like it's going to break, especially because of the basis effects we have coming up. "
"9941900","9946640"," Now the question becomes, I would note that Subhadra used the verb penciled in the recession."
"9946660","9950360"," She did not use the word penned in the recession or etched in the recession."
"9950920","9954400"," The question becomes, why does the Fed cut rates next year?"
"9954400","9958160"," And that will be critical to the magnitude of the cuts that come. "
"9958560","9963200"," If the Fed is cutting rates because of the penciled in recession, that's another amount."
"9963360","9965660"," And I think she already said 150 basis points."
"9965660","9971180"," But if it does so, because it needs to get less restrictive relative to the economy and not do what"
"9971180","9975400"," Stephen Whiting talked about, which is to punish the economy, then I think we'll have a more modest"
"9975400","9976400"," set of break cuts next year. "
"9976560","9979820"," Yes, Subhadra, the rate cuts when we have a risk, that's the easy call."
"9980000","9983660"," The downturn, you know, that's an easy script for the Fed to kind of use."
"9983960","9987660"," The much more tricky one is the rate cuts without the downturn. "
"9988500","9992640"," And look, we all here have been talking endlessly about how inflation rate falls."
"9992840","9994060"," They can bring down the Fed funds rate."
"9994300","9996760"," Is that really that hard to explain to the broad public?"
"9997020","9998520"," Why shouldn't they go ahead and do that?"
"10000720","10001500"," They could. "
"10002020","10003940"," They did it back in the 90s."
"10004420","10008060"," And Greenspan was able to orchestrate a soft landing."
"10008560","10009660"," But it's very unusual. "
"10009660","10012560"," And you just don't know how things are going to play out."
"10013420","10019940"," If you look at, as you were mentioning, inflation break evens have come down, core PC starting to"
"10019940","10021700"," trend down quite meaningfully."
"10022660","10028120"," Let's say by the middle of next year, we're at two and a half percent core PC and the Fed"
"10028120","10030440"," funds rate is at five and a half percent. "
"10030840","10036860"," At that point, it gets, you know, very obviously in restrictive territory and there could be a case"
"10036860","10040020"," made for the Fed to adjust policy."
"10040440","10042740"," Even if employment doesn't crack meaningfully."
"10042840","10047400"," And then we do expect employment to slow down in the first quarter by meaninglessly. "
"10047740","10052160"," Let's put it slightly differently, which is to say this is a Fed that has almost the perfect"
"10052160","10053440"," situation right now."
"10053760","10057680"," If they don't act, they're going to ruin it because they're going to move us into restrictive"
"10057680","10057960"," policy."
"10058040","10062320"," Like a three point restrictive policy is historically extremely restrictive. "
"10062640","10065360"," If they don't, if they do nothing, we're going to, we're heading in that direction."
"10065880","10066360"," Yeah."
"10067140","10074080"," And they want to mostly see inflation durability head towards that two percent inflation target. "
"10074080","10078080"," I mean, core PC is still between three and three and a half percent."
"10078260","10083720"," Yes, it's trending lower, but they really want to see that get towards maybe two and a half or"
"10083720","10088460"," anywhere between two and a half and three percent before they cut rates because the last thing they"
"10088460","10094260"," want to do is to cut rates prematurely and then find out that inflation is starting to rise again."
"10094260","10100820"," I mean, shelter inflation is still relatively sticky, although, you know, the rest of the basket is"
"10100820","10101720"," coming down nicely. "
"10102260","10107320"," So I think that they really want to see inflation durability towards heading towards at least two"
"10107320","10108640"," and a half percent before they cut rates."
"10108800","10110540"," It could just be, and I'll give you the last word."
"10110740","10112140"," See if it leaves me before we let you go. "
"10112240","10113240"," It could just be a while."
"10113340","10114280"," Maybe it won't be a while."
"10114500","10119080"," Maybe, you know, maybe the data will move in that direction, but it could be a while before we get"
"10119080","10123380"," the kind of prints that would really give them the confidence that they're looking for around, you"
"10123380","10124920"," know, two and a half percent of that range. "
"10125520","10126960"," I'll give Steve Whiting the last word."
"10127060","10130320"," I just want to say this is very quickly, Kelly, that I don't think the market and the Fed are"
"10130320","10130860"," that far off."
"10130960","10135040"," I think there's time for them to come together, and I don't think they're on different pages when"
"10135040","10136240"," it comes to the reaction function. "
"10136580","10141720"," I think if inflation slows meaningfully for the next several months, the Fed could be talking about"
"10141720","10143720"," springtime or early summer rate cuts."
"10144100","10146140"," If inflation is smooth, all right, maybe springtime."
"10146440","10149060"," And Steve Whiting then would give us kind of the wrap on that. "
"10149060","10151320"," So, look, I hope Steve Leisman is right."
"10151460","10156380"," Again, that the Federal Reserve is on board for some easing of monetary policy, not forcing"
"10156380","10161560"," monetary policy to tighten, right, and to interact and cause a deeper downturn in employment."
"10162260","10166480"," But the one thing that we all keep talking about is recession is this fixed thing that always"
"10166480","10168020"," behaves exactly the same way. "
"10168360","10170880"," The economy is behaving unusually right now."
"10171320","10173800"," We're seeing a strong labor market and a lot of industries contract."
"10174320","10176480"," Well, there's a difference coming ahead. "
"10176480","10181760"," And even if it doesn't fit this perfect recession scenario that everybody can trade in and out of"
"10181760","10186820"," the market out of it, the Federal Reserve should still react and do what their dual mandate"
"10186820","10190080"," suggests, and that's protect the labor market and slow inflation."
"10190780","10191300"," All right."
"10191600","10192500"," We will leave it there, everybody. "
"10192920","10193280"," Thank you."
"10193720","10194740"," That would be an exciting hour."
"10194960","10197560"," So, Baja Rajapa, Steve Whiting, Steve Leisman will see you shortly. "
"10198340","10201740"," Coming up, more to trade have dropped nearly a full point in less than two months."
"10202060","10207140"," Enough that some homeowners are able to refinance the unlucky ones who bought at the highs, but"
"10207140","10209360"," doesn't tip the scales for the broader housing market."
"10209800","10214720"," Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandy, will join me with his view as home builder stocks continue to"
"10214720","10215820"," hit new all-time highs. "
"10216300","10218340"," And as we had to break, here's a look at the markets."
"10218680","10219700"," We'll call it a holding pattern."
"10220040","10224560"," Dow is literally about unchanged S&P up less than a point in that deck down 10. "
"10225000","10231720"," Ten-year yields right around 4.16. About 46 minutes to go until we hear from the Fed."
"10231940","10233340"," The exchange is back after this."
"10236540","10239780"," This is the exchange on CNBC. "
"10263610","10267550"," Shortly expecting the results of the Fed Reverse Reporporation."
"10278560","10286100"," Pound Dollar falls at 0.5% to 1.25%. The lowest since November 23rd."
"10328440","10335320"," 95 counterparties take 823.329 billion dollars at the Fed Reverse Reporporation. "
"10397580","10398940"," Welcome back, everybody."
"10398940","10404460"," The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage almost dipping below 7% as you can see there, but we're"
"10404460","10405980"," still slightly above that right now."
"10406320","10411920"," Barrowers taking advantage of that recent drop with REFI applications actually jumping 19% last"
"10411920","10412180"," week. "
"10412640","10414200"," Demand for new mortgages was up slightly."
"10414600","10416300"," Still down 18% from a year ago, though."
"10416660","10421160"," In my next guest, who doesn't see a meaningful turnaround in housing until rates are below 6% and"
"10421160","10425440"," he doesn't see that happening until late 2025 or 2024. "
"10425820","10428120"," Let's ask Mark Zandy, his chief economist at Moody's."
"10428880","10430580"," Now I'm getting confused, Mark."
"10430740","10431700"," When do you think that's going to happen?"
"10432640","10434740"," Did I say there was a typo 2025?"
"10434880","10436100"," No, I think 2024. "
"10437100","10442020"," This time next year, I expect fixed mortgage rates to be around 6%."
"10442020","10442420"," Okay."
"10443060","10443800"," That's really not much. "
"10444360","10451460"," I guess around 6% number is different than it being 6.99. Indeed."
"10451840","10458380"," I mean, if you kind of have a pulse on the market, every time mortgage rights rise north of seven,"
"10458580","10460240"," the market just goes ice cold."
"10460680","10462580"," It's completely unaffordable. "
"10462760","10466260"," People stop transacting, home sales just fall."
"10467000","10467580"," Get around six."
"10467920","10470160"," It feels like life comes back into the market and Kelly. "
"10470900","10474820"," Longer run, you know, abstracting from the vagaries of the ups and downs and everything else in the"
"10474820","10475340"," business cycle."
"10475560","10477900"," I think people should get used to fixed mortgage rates somewhere."
"10478600","10479920"," Five and a half, six percent. "
"10480060","10482340"," So that's kind of where I think we should expect them."
"10482440","10482700"," Long run."
"10482880","10483420"," The new normal. "
"10484660","10488840"," Well, I guess going back to the future, maybe that's kind of sort of where we were."
"10489160","10493660"," We, you know, what was abnormal was the long period after the financial crisis when interest rates"
"10493660","10494480"," were just depressed."
"10494920","10497840"," Now we're getting back to something that's more consistent with a healthy economy. "
"10497840","10503760"," And I think, you know, tenured treasury yield around four and that would put the 30 or fixed at"
"10503760","10504860"," five and a half to six."
"10505160","10505620"," Something like that."
"10505620","10508780"," Well, let me ask you something in this quickly turning into my chart obsession of the day. "
"10508880","10510980"," We're going to put up the five year inflation break evens again."
"10511440","10512840"," 208 is the reading there."
"10512940","10516740"," And I'm looking back at the history throughout the 2010s when mortgage rates were incredibly low. "
"10517380","10519740"," 208 is kind of where we were for that period as well."
"10520120","10524160"," So based on what the market's telling us, why shouldn't we expect rates to go back towards what"
"10524160","10526880"," prevailed last decade instead of staying at much higher levels?"
"10527740","10530140"," Well, you know, it gets to really yields term premiums."
"10530760","10533320"," You know, I do think we're in a very different world. "
"10533320","10536040"," You know, lots of ways of thinking about it."
"10536080","10540780"," But just think about in the context of inflation in the period after the financial crisis, the Fed"
"10540780","10543520"," was working really hard to get inflation up."
"10543840","10545120"," Inflation was suboptimal. "
"10545380","10550440"," You know, it was, they kept their foot on the accelerator and, you know, they kept interest rates"
"10550440","10551140"," generally low."
"10551480","10555120"," Now on the other side of the pandemic feels like we're in a different world with regard to"
"10555120","10555360"," inflation."
"10555860","10557740"," You know, we're deep globalizing. "
"10557940","10559500"," We've got transition costs around green energy."
"10560200","10564460"," So it feels like inflation is going to be more of a headwind than the tailwind that's going to have"
"10564460","10566800"," its foot more on the break than the accelerator."
"10567300","10571760"," And therefore, you know, we get more normalized, you know, pre financial crisis kind of interest"
"10571760","10572000"," rates. "
"10572240","10577400"," Is the biggest risk and not to put you, you know, equity analyst hat on here, but it's incredible"
"10577400","10582060"," to see how the new, the home builders have been going to new highs constantly here, even as the"
"10582060","10583820"," housing market in general is completely frozen."
"10583820","10585320"," It's like the flip side of the story."
"10585720","10589980"," If we get a normalization in housing, is that the biggest headwind for the home builders, anything"
"10589980","10594580"," that releases inventory back on the market gets things back back to normal?"
"10594640","10598060"," Does that ironically hurt the hottest segment of that market right now?"
"10598340","10599300"," Not for a while. "
"10599460","10601620"," I mean, I think they've got a nice demographic tailwind."
"10601700","10602860"," I mean, they've got a couple things going."
"10603080","10607460"," One is there's a very severe shortage of homes, you know, particularly at lower price points,"
"10607460","10608680"," affordable housing. "
"10609500","10613340"," You know, by my calculation, we're short by about 1.7 million housing units."
"10613500","10614620"," That's a lot of units."
"10614820","10617740"," That's more than one year's worth of production in a typical year. "
"10618260","10619640"," And they've got to make that up."
"10619640","10622560"," And then I do think there's, you know, underlying demographic demand."
"10622660","10623400"," Here's the other thing, Kelly. "
"10624080","10625260"," Immigration is strong."
"10625560","10630540"," I think we're getting the data coming in suggests that there's a lot more immigrants coming into"
"10630540","10632800"," the country than it has been the case historically."
"10633240","10636560"," And of course, you know, more people, more households, more housing. "
"10637200","10641760"," So I think, you know, for the next few, three, four, five, six years, I think the home builders"
"10641760","10644800"," have some really significant tailwinds that could help to support them."
"10645160","10645400"," Yeah."
"10645400","10649400"," Although I don't know what we think of that kind of immigration is driving household formation so"
"10649400","10652800"," much as maybe literally being part of the renting population or something like that. "
"10653200","10654340"," Well, it's using eyes."
"10654760","10655140"," Yes."
"10655380","10655780"," Yes. "
"10656100","10656420"," That's true."
"10656660","10661720"," But it means adding to that the demand for the housing stock and therefore, you know, lists all"
"10661720","10662460"," boats, I think."
"10662680","10663860"," But you're right. "
"10664160","10666900"," No, and obviously anyone, it displaces as a renter."
"10666960","10668700"," Maybe they move into the housing pool and so on."
"10668860","10668920"," Exactly. "
"10669220","10672100"," So going back to the Fed today, what do you expect to hear from Chair Powell?"
"10672840","10673780"," Not much."
"10673980","10677380"," You know, I think the Fed has the economy right where they want it."
"10677660","10681900"," You know, it feels like the job market's cooling in a very graceful early way. "
"10682440","10687020"," You know, wage growth is moderating and pretty close to being consistent with their long run"
"10687020","10687880"," inflation target."
"10688080","10688940"," Inflation's coming in."
"10689260","10690420"," It's still too high. "
"10691080","10694060"," But, you know, all the trend lines look really good there."
"10694280","10700080"," And, you know, the forecast seems pretty clear that we're going to get back to target sometime this"
"10700080","10700780"," time next year."
"10700780","10705220"," Financial conditions, you know, we can, we can debate that a little bit, but, you know, stock"
"10705220","10710920"," prices, bond yields, the value of the dollar, credit spreads, under running standards, all three"
"10710920","10712140"," away, you know, in a pretty good spot. "
"10712440","10715180"," So they must feel, Chair Powell is pretty good about this."
"10715320","10718500"," So I think his goal here is not to rock any boats."
"10719100","10719360"," What is the best?"
"10719360","10720180"," We're on track. "
"10720320","10720960"," What is the best?"
"10721200","10721780"," The best."
"10722600","10723160"," Wait, all the best."
"10723360","10729020"," Just the million dollar question for you is do you think that they should avoid further tightening,"
"10729480","10733640"," you know, do they have to cut reach, you know, pretty soon there in the way of inflation going for"
"10733640","10734000"," our nation?"
"10734300","10735160"," I don't think so. "
"10735700","10736460"," Certainly not right."
"10736700","10740700"," I don't see, you know, I don't see any reason why you do that in the context we're going to"
"10740700","10741100"," have this today."
"10741760","10744440"," But, you know, the question is, I hope we can start the lower rate. "
"10744780","10746280"," And I think they've got some time."
"10746400","10751080"," I think they're going to wait until they see the disease work fantastic."
"10751300","10753440"," Imagine quilting coming to target is right. "
"10753700","10757000"," And that's probably won't be until next spring, summer."
"10757320","10758540"," They must have come back on."
"10758740","10761860"," I'd also gather economic research from ancient countries. "
"10762100","10762220"," Right?"
"10762540","10763280"," How will the ice go?"
"10763460","10764780"," System will not be equal."
"10764980","10767080"," They're rather broad not to move right there."
"10767280","10770500"," In the direction they will, you know, affect the use of the monetary policy. "
"10770760","10775560"," Getting closer and wrapped up in what's going to be pretty, I think, uncomfortable election"
"10775560","10776080"," process."
"10776260","10778440"," So I think they would err on the side of doing nothing."
"10778440","10783060"," One of the facts most recognized by the Russians is conducting this monitoring here on top of"
"10783060","10783540"," everything else. "
"10783540","10785700"," We'll check back in soon."
"10785840","10786420"," We appreciate it."
"10786700","10787420"," And the availability for many. "
"10787880","10791820"," And that drop in market rates we mentioned is boosting the whole builders, the whole construction"
"10791820","10793380"," into the ITI monetary policy."
"10793720","10794940"," Another all-time ride today."
"10795220","10797820"," And it's going to be 5% since January 1st. "
"10798180","10800640"," Holding your high levels among the four opponents in all time."
"10800760","10803900"," And those teams are still trading at just about nine and ten times four."
"10804640","10808720"," They're making it easier for them all around nine and a half times. "
"10809040","10812520"," We'll be listening to the monetary policy centers that are made by the federal government."
"10812520","10816560"," Coming up the talk, Internet trades for $20.24. Change can work in four to five."
"10816920","10818020"," Amazon is number one. "
"10818220","10819900"," Some of their other calls are more interesting."
"10820760","10823520"," Like this one already has 150% this year."
"10823680","10824660"," We will reveal it. "
"10824660","10828780"," In addition to the United States and the United States and the federal government."
"10828780","10848300"," The"
"10848300","10857000"," federal"
"10857000","10858660"," government."
"10859400","10861000"," I didn't know that was playing in the background. "
"10863460","10865360"," Okay, so I'm back with you here right now."
"10865940","10868420"," I do have a question if anyone is listening right now."
"10868860","10872860"," I couldn't find a link to the presser at two thirty. "
"10874160","10880540"," Or even the rate decision at two p.m. Now I will have the I will have at two p "
"10880540","10883220",".m. The news release in my hands."
"10883220","10890980"," You'll hear from the new squawk someone highlighting the key points of the press release for the"
"10890980","10898620"," rate decision at two p.m. Then I will continue to look for the presser link for the live coverage"
"10898620","10904140"," of when Jerome speaks at two thirty p.m. But from this where I'm at right now on the Fed"
"10904140","10909860"," Reserve YouTube channel can't find it can't find it on the Fed Reserve website either."
"10913180","10914760"," So what else I got for you?"
"10915120","10915800"," Let me see here. "
"10916160","10920920"," I'm going to read off a a prepper or a primer for the rate decision here."
"10921520","10924900"," And I'm just going to read this to you as we lead into the two p.m. hour once we"
"10924900","10925540"," get that decision."
"10926580","10928300"," See if I can take this off. "
"10930900","10932060"," Here is the break."
"10943410","10944650"," Yeah, I'm on the reserves website."
"10944950","10948350"," I don't see it anywhere on the website and I'm on the YouTube channel not seeing a link. "
"10949130","10950950"," Anybody sees a link to the."
"10951830","10953590"," Anyone sees a link to the actual."
"10958800","10960380"," As a link to the actual. "
"10961400","10962600"," Turn that back."
"10964220","10965180"," Slide that over."
"10969340","10971040"," Anyone has a link to. "
"10973580","10973940"," The."
"10979400","10980580"," To the presser, let me know."
"10980960","10982800"," I don't see one out there anywhere available. "
"10985800","10986680"," We want quick second."
"10986860","10987360"," I got to take this call."
"11131160","11132900"," All right, back with you here again. "
"11133040","11134020"," I apologize for that."
"11134340","11137740"," We're making some progress here on the website and I had to take a call."
"11137800","11138540"," I didn't have a choice there. "
"11141280","11143540"," Yeah, I've got the live link now."
"11143600","11143920"," I apologize."
"11144280","11144820"," I meant to say something. "
"11144960","11147920"," Harushi provided a link while I was on that call."
"11148160","11148880"," So I do have a link."
"11149020","11153260"," It's open and I will turn it on as soon as we get to the two o'clock hour. "
"11153300","11154700"," So it's a few things here."
"11154960","11155320"," Number one."
"11156860","11163360"," At 2 p.m. You are going to get the live stream from the fed to 30, whatever that is. "
"11163640","11165020"," You'll also hear a."
"11165020","11167800"," A new squacker talking in the background."
"11168480","11172220"," And what they're going to do is furiously review the PDF."
"11172940","11176260"," That's dropped with the rate decision and they will highlight. "
"11177240","11179480"," Either hawkish or dovish."
"11180220","11182520"," Points from that news release."
"11183180","11186420"," So you have the initial reaction at 2 p.m. And then at 2 30 p.m. Just be aware"
"11186420","11187800"," that whatever moves we make. "
"11188520","11191900"," You could see potentially a pullback from that move."
"11193120","11194540"," Awaiting Jerome Powell."
"11195400","11196680"," Inside of these news conferences. "
"11197960","11199620"," There's a lot to be seen, right?"
"11199800","11200820"," You want to see what he looks like?"
"11201020","11201620"," How he's dressed?"
"11201920","11203440"," You want to see his demeanor?"
"11204500","11207060"," You want to see if he looks like he's in control."
"11207380","11208620"," Sometimes he looks like he's in control."
"11208740","11210080"," Sometimes he doesn't look like he's in control. "
"11210900","11214960"," And then another key point here is his reaction to questions from the press."
"11217440","11219320"," Are they throwing softballs at him?"
"11219460","11220000"," Are they not?"
"11221140","11223200"," Is he getting angry?"
"11223780","11226800"," Sometimes in pressers he will get angry with lines of questioning."
"11227780","11229100"," Other times he gets triggered. "
"11229780","11233020"," I've seen him in pressers where he starts out awesome sauce."
"11234340","11243980"," And then one of the right bench reporters will start to ask more pointy questions"
"11243980","11246300"," towards the end of his pressers."
"11246300","11253060"," Sometimes if they do it the right way, if they do it the right way they can trigger him into"
"11253060","11254220"," happy hawkish mode. "
"11254420","11261040"," Other times he'll go against those lines of questioning."
"11261460","11268400"," So it's important for you if you can, oftentimes to pay attention to the presser right to the"
"11268400","11268960"," bitter end."
"11268960","11272680"," Last rate decision I think they went all the way to 4pm. "
"11272920","11273580"," That's very unusual."
"11274040","11277400"," Right to 4pm market was just murdered into the close."
"11278260","11281820"," So pay attention to the length of time that that presser takes place. "
"11283000","11287480"," And to be honest, if I had to guess today, like best guess trader had on."
"11288880","11291140"," Zero rate increase, data dependence."
"11291980","11295340"," And then I don't know if it's hawkish, but a promise of more rate cuts to come. "
"11295340","11297180"," Or excuse me, rate increases to come."
"11297340","11299060"," The threat of more rate increases to come."
"11299340","11301200"," I think this is likely a non-event. "
"11301900","11306340"," I think you're going to see a large part of the market be hedged here and we get the crush"
"11306340","11306800"," on that."
"11307340","11311420"," I also think that to the upside, that same thing."
"11311660","11314760"," People that are looking for that all time high is probably not. "
"11315000","11320240"," It would be fascinating to see if we could get that new high above, which is right here."
"11321360","11323640"," Even if we tag it, even if we tag it briefly."
"11324500","11327920"," This is the January 22 high of 46713. "
"11328140","11329340"," I'd really like to just see it."
"11329640","11330380"," We are here."
"11331060","11331360"," Okay. "
"11331860","11336920"," So even if it's brief, we go up and touch it and just break above it."
"11336960","11340240"," Even if it's just the tip, it would be nice to see."
"11340420","11342240"," So if you're a bull, that's what you're looking for. "
"11343600","11345420"," Is that that's the anticipation."
"11346000","11346600"," We are here."
"11347460","11347840"," Okay. "
"11347840","11352760"," So there's no reason not to at least touch it up there."
"11354440","11355520"," Now saying that."
"11356440","11359780"," If we do that, I think there's a pullback. "
"11360080","11362860"," I don't today at least some kind of ball crush."
"11363800","11366120"," If I was a bull, we'll trade it."
"11366280","11370300"," If we break above it and keep moving higher after this rate decision, we'll trade it. "
"11370480","11377820"," But just be aware if you're a bull that oftentimes these things are used to trigger your FOMO."
"11377820","11379260"," And then they trap you."
"11379420","11381080"," So just be aware of that later today. "
"11381980","11384620"," Now there are some things that likely aren't priced in."
"11385100","11387780"," Of course, 25 BPS is not priced in."
"11389000","11395320"," Also, that thing I talked about earlier, if he doesn't raise, but he threatens and says to you,"
"11395420","11397140"," we're going to have another meeting in January. "
"11397760","11400720"," That's not priced in as well."
"11401000","11405560"," And then there's some other things that aren't priced in would be if you get the no rate hike and"
"11405560","11411000"," then you get a victory lap or a bullish or a Dovish Jerome Powell."
"11411400","11413280"," That's not priced in to today. "
"11413960","11418760"," So some key points that you're going to be looking for today is, is he dovish, not priced in,"
"11418920","11419140"," right?"
"11421460","11422680"," Not priced in the market."
"11423100","11428600"," Another thing would not priced in would be if he threatens not only threatens, but says we've got"
"11428600","11429900"," another decision coming up in January."
"11429900","11430760"," I'll see you in a month. "
"11431260","11432120"," Is that something like that?"
"11432920","11434040"," That's scary, right?"
"11434040","11434980"," That's not priced in."
"11435020","11437120"," Another thing's not priced in is 25 BPS."
"11437600","11439040"," He does surprise hike today. "
"11439940","11443520"," It's going to be initially probably bearish off of that."
"11443820","11444980"," So just be aware of those things."
"11445560","11451220"," Now, if we get a non-event, I would expect them to crush the up and down side at some"
"11451220","11451740"," point today. "
"11452620","11454320"," And we should stay on our trend."
"11456660","11458060"," All things being equal."
"11458340","11459100"," Stay on trend. "
"11461980","11464720"," Let me know in the chat what you think."
"11464880","11472300"," How about this in the chat if you'd like to give your thoughts in a brief, like zero percent talk,"
"11472880","11478300"," zero percent Dov, 25 BPS, not your feelings or what you want."
"11478660","11485800"," Or you can even say trader hats, main street hat, trader hats, zero, zero, 25 or rate cuts or"
"11485800","11486440"," whatever it is. "
"11487200","11490700"," Now, rate cuts, as a matter of fact, we actually got a cut today, which I don't think that's what"
"11490700","11490820"," we do."
"11490900","11493840"," It's a very small possibility, small."
"11494180","11500240"," But if it was, my take would be that we would scream, scream to the upside for liquidity, and then"
"11500240","11506480"," they would sell the fuck out of this market in a bad way, a really bad way. "
"11510910","11516990"," But feel free in the chat today to comment, however you want to comment."
"11517710","11519830"," Whatever you want to say, now do your thing."
"11523260","11526300"," Yes, the kid time is saying non-event. "
"11526600","11528820"," The last three have been kind of non-events, haven't they?"
"11529740","11532820"," Then we have made moves down and up and prior events."
"11534200","11535320"," But they've been non-events."
"11535760","11540860"," These last like three rate decisions, I think, were generally non-events. "
"11541140","11545200"," They weren't like the kind of events where fucking whole market blasts down to the depths of hell."
"11545760","11548160"," They do afterwards, but not the event."
"11554830","11560090"," So, where do we go cap 466 at 2 p.m.? Good question. "
"11560310","11564070"," So, if you want what I think happens here, I'll give it to you right now."
"11566050","11568250"," What I think, let me see if it snaps some lines today."
"11568410","11568970"," That's a good question. "
"11571630","11573370"," You want my take and what I think happens?"
"11574970","11576910"," Do not trade this, okay?"
"11579410","11586250"," So, there's 2 p.m. Be like, hey, Captain told me to do this or Captain thought this and he"
"11586250","11586670"," was wrong."
"11586970","11588430"," I don't want to hear any of that crap from you guys."
"11589610","11590490"," You guys are..."
"11590870","11592650"," It's not you guys, but some of you are brutal. "
"11593470","11594890"," Some of you are like..."
"11595370","11596910"," Some of you guys are fucking..."
"11597490","11601130"," Three guys are like, I want you to tell us what's going to happen and then if it doesn't happen,"
"11601250","11603070"," you're like, I'm pissed off at him and I'll like him."
"11603830","11613660"," So, what I think happens is you're going to get an initial move down right here."
"11614720","11617840"," Likely it's just touch the tip, possibly even down here. "
"11619560","11621140"," And then I think you're going to get the move higher."
"11621620","11625180"," So, I'm just going to make this a little bit thicker in a different color too."
"11625600","11625920"," Yeah, there we go. "
"11627020","11629640"," And maybe change the color to white."
"11629640","11636980"," I think you get your initial rip higher."
"11638680","11641640"," And I think that you might..."
"11642180","11643640"," You might possibly..."
"11646300","11647400"," Let me draw this better. "
"11647640","11648060"," Hold on a second."
"11648880","11649240"," Hi, Katie."
"11649880","11650080"," How are you?"
"11650220","11651180"," We got new cats, by the way. "
"11652020","11652800"," I think you get that weakness."
"11653520","11655440"," You get that initial push up to R1."
"11656540","11658900"," You just slam it back down and then boom right there. "
"11661060","11663700"," And then I think you come back down for the meeting."
"11664260","11665540"," You're going to be all bolded up."
"11666040","11668220"," We're going to come right back down to this meeting. "
"11671320","11675060"," Hold on here."
"11690890","11692810"," Right down there and that's how we close."
"11693210","11694250"," Something just like that. "
"11694910","11696410"," That's what I think we're going to do."
"11697570","11698010"," Thanks."
"11698290","11699790"," You get your squeeze up if it's a non-event. "
"11701450","11702990"," I'm down here right two o'clock."
"11704130","11704610"," Boom."
"11705650","11707250"," You get fucked on your calls. "
"11707910","11708350"," They reprice."
"11708790","11709990"," Boom, you got to get back in."
"11710450","11710990"," Calls print. "
"11711810","11714070"," You fail the high back over here."
"11714390","11715550"," Or you possibly touch it."
"11715730","11716430"," Whoop, right above. "
"11717310","11718750"," Come back down for this presser."
"11719570","11721030"," And then they pin it."
"11722170","11724970"," And then eventually we come back down and bleed off into the close. "
"11726150","11728690"," That four sixty five zero and the force."
"11729630","11731210"," Or excuse me four fives."
"11731490","11732130"," Excuse me. "
"11732910","11739430"," Four six five zero and the four six zero zero is."
"11740370","11741910"," Possibly in play for today."
"11743330","11745250"," So let me move all this over over here. "
"11745490","11745850"," Hi kitty."
"11746010","11746850"," I love you too, kitty."
"11748470","11750070"," Move that over there for you. "
"11750290","11751250"," I like you too, kitty."
"11751250","11754430"," You want to get frisking to have nap time."
"11754650","11754970"," I understand. "
"11758070","11759570"," Leave that over there."
"11759810","11765370"," January 22 and too high right there are two right here are three right here."
"11766630","11769510"," So something like that is the expectation. "
"11771870","11772990"," Something like that."
"11773810","11775190"," Does that work for you guys?"
"11775610","11777890"," Are you guys you guys anti this?"
"11780690","11783830"," I think this is your risk into the event down here."
"11784750","11788430"," I'm going to run this bad boy up running up there and then we're going to come back down. "
"11790290","11792350"," That's my that's my thought process here."
"11792950","11794410"," I'm going to delete all this now."
"11794410","11795950"," Okay, so it's not your way. "
"11799110","11800670"," Delete that right there."
"11801710","11805830"," We've got 20 minutes until the rate decision."
"11818060","11826600"," Well, you know, I think there's a better move for bulls and bears on the 15th or maybe not bears. "
"11826860","11830320"," I think for bulls, their best trade is likely in the 15th."
"11830380","11832060"," Now, I'm going to say something on this."
"11832200","11832300"," Okay. "
"11834400","11844220"," What I've noticed the past three weeks, four weeks is the timing is"
"11844220","11844620"," right."
"11844620","11846720"," But there's some front running going on."
"11848360","11850780"," There's a lot of front running happening and. "
"11854020","11856780"," Retarded like a like an engine right like retarded engine."
"11856800","11857960"," There's there's like a."
"11858920","11863120"," We're like they're doing it a day before a day after the expected moves."
"11863180","11865220"," And so you're seeing like front running. "
"11865220","11866640"," I'm assuming this is retailers."
"11867180","11868500"," I know some of a bunch of it is."
"11868500","11871400"," A dealer game and stuff like that. "
"11871540","11876560"," But I'm noticing that like the timing is slightly off this year and I think it might just be."
"11877100","11879920"," We're going to get ahead of you before you get in kind of stuff."
"11880000","11883580"," So it's possible it could happen for the 15th to. "
"11885240","11886880"," By like a day, which is fine."
"11887140","11887900"," I can do the day."
"11888000","11888940"," The day like this. "
"11889080","11889800"," Does it happen today?"
"11889900","11890440"," Does it happen tomorrow?"
"11890520","11891040"," That kind of stuff."
"11896730","11898330"," You'll cry laughing if they raised today."
"11898590","11898810"," I did. "
"11898950","11899490"," I hope that my."
"11899490","11901170"," You got to switch this shit."
"11901370","11902150"," My main street hat. "
"11902910","11904530"," I'd really like to see a raise today."
"11904690","11905110"," I'll be honest."
"11905650","11908170"," Like there's a side of me a main street side of me. "
"11908910","11910910"," I was a young person or an old person."
"11910930","11912410"," If I was young or old."
"11913570","11915750"," If I was 18 to. "
"11916530","11916970"," 35."
"11918370","11920870"," I'd be like raise the fuck out of this shit."
"11921030","11923390"," If I was old, I'd be saying the same thing. "
"11923470","11925130"," If I was retired, like truly retired."
"11926030","11928030"," Like like I got the Social Security."
"11928030","11931070"," I got the 401k go and pension going and. "
"11931510","11933410"," I would want that hike as well."
"11934110","11934850"," I really would."
"11936270","11938390"," We're going to see old people get priced out. "
"11939590","11941490"," They will and they're going to get."
"11942130","11944210"," The rug pulled from underneath them."
"11944390","11948830"," And then if this if they don't raise continue to raise rates, if not now in the future. "
"11949290","11952130"," And you're going to see a door closed to young people."
"11952770","11953430"," That's true."
"11956230","11957470"," That is true. "
"11958170","11959970"," That's my take on that."
"11966190","11967730"," I see you, Demente."
"11974330","11983000"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"11984440","11986840"," We're poised for all the good stuff."
"11987160","11989300"," Market seems like it's poised for all the good stuff."
"11990300","11991380"," I can tell you this. "
"11992440","11994080"," We can tell you this for a fact."
"11994320","11995240"," This came off terminal."
"11996240","11998240"," And I think I read that too earlier. "
"11998460","12001160"," That maybe I did or didn't read it to you again."
"12001420","12003820"," So I do want you to know that."
"12004360","12005540"," Let me see right there. "
"12005900","12006820"," Read this to you here."
"12024270","12026370"," So yesterday's performance, right?"
"12027250","12030770"," It's impressive, but major buyers are absent."
"12031070","12031770"," I want you to know that. "
"12031770","12037070"," The major buyers, like CTA's, they weren't buyers yesterday."
"12037790","12039190"," They're likely not buyers today."
"12039290","12040190"," They're just sitting in the sidelines. "
"12040810","12041450"," Doesn't mean they're sellers."
"12041830","12042130"," Net sellers."
"12042390","12043030"," They're just not buyers. "
"12044450","12045390"," Dealers are not buyers."
"12046750","12047110"," Corporates."
"12047890","12049470"," They're fading buyers right now. "
"12049930","12051830"," So the markets just kind of like what?"
"12052410","12055190"," There's a lot of people out there that are waiting for this decision."
"12055630","12057490"," I just got to phone with Joe Donut."
"12057910","12059350"," And he's like, we're waiting. "
"12059650","12060950"," We're waiting to see what he has to say."
"12060950","12066550"," So I'm going to assume here that we get the US interest rate decision."
"12067050","12070550"," Forecast, no change on the prior five spot, five percent. "
"12070830","12075510"," The FOMC summary of economic projections and the FOMC rate statement."
"12075890","12077990"," Looking at some analysts views ahead of this."
"12078550","12083230"," Wells Fargo say it appears that the federal reserves tightening cycle has come to an end. "
"12083470","12088590"," Since the summer, the FOMC has been keeping its options open regarding the possibility of an"
"12088590","12089790"," additional rate type."
"12089790","12096410"," However, recent economic data and comments suggest less need and desire to exercise that option."
"12097230","12102450"," We see the committee leaving the Fed funds target range at its current level of five spot two five"
"12102450","12104010"," to five spot five percent. "
"12104510","12108030"," At the conclusion of its upcoming meeting on December 13th."
"12108350","12114390"," If realized, the third consecutive hold would suggest that rather than the FOMC merely hiking at a"
"12114390","12115010"," slower pace."
"12115010","12119890"," The Fed funds rate probably has reached its terminal level of this cycle. "
"12120570","12124330"," With the committee seeming to settle into a prolonged hold."
"12124930","12130090"," The conversation around the future policy path will shift towards when and under what circumstances"
"12130090","12133010"," the FOMC eventually cuts rates."
"12134110","12141310"," We have maintained since the FOMC last rates raised the Fed funds rate at its July 26th meeting. "
"12141310","12147270"," The increase was likely the last of its hiking cycle of you not always shared by market"
"12147270","12147830"," participants."
"12148690","12155210"," As recently as October market pricing suggested that another 25 basis points hike was slightly more"
"12155210","12156170"," likely than not."
"12156650","12163210"," A bit bolstered in part by committee members own projections in September as shown in the nib. "
"12169020","12170580"," We just got cut off here."
"12170580","12176920"," The declining odds of one additional hike this year comes as both sides of the Fed's mandate are"
"12176920","12179940"," moving toward their long run desired levels."
"12180340","12186460"," Notably inflation has made encouraging progress towards returning to the FOMC's 2% target. "
"12187100","12192660"," In October, core PC inflation, the Fed's preferred benchmark for price growth, fell to three spot"
"12192660","12196420"," five percent year over year, nearly two and a half year low."
"12196420","12202640"," The latest monthly readings suggest the recent pace has downshifted even further with core prices"
"12202640","12208540"," in October up at a three month annualized rate of only two spot four percent relative to July."
"12221260","12223220"," Look at that rug down there. "
"12223420","12227720"," A little tiny little tiny rug down there."
"12228140","12230040"," Not much sitting right here is there."
"12230900","12233520"," Not a whole lot of support right there. "
"12235320","12240100"," Not a lot of support right there."
"12240640","12241880"," Sorry, I apologize for the coffin."
"12242020","12242760"," I'm losing my voice. "
"12244860","12248300"," My voice is getting destroyed here on streaming every day."
"12261850","12263210"," What's my position to this?"
"12263450","12268750"," I have a, I've got a putback spread on the market that expires in June."
"12268750","12272190"," I still have not harvested the long side of that trade. "
"12273230","12279830"," Looking for that tag of all time highs to cut that side of the trade out."
"12280290","12286450"," The other side of the trade I'll leave on into hopefully I can get a downside move in February or"

"12288810","12290570"," Then close the other side of that trade. "
"12290910","12293750"," If not today, if something bad happens, I've got."
"12296570","12297510"," Let me see here."
"12297630","12300150"," I've got, let me read off what I've got to your position right now. "
"12303230","12307210"," I've got a expiring today for 69 C's."
"12308670","12311750"," Expiring today for 67 C's."
"12313210","12323030"," Expiring today a fuck ton of 450 P's like bloodbath P's like fuck"
"12323030","12323590"," ton of them. "
"12323670","12326430"," Very cheap cost me nothing like a penny or something like that."
"12328510","12330710"," I've got what else do I have?"
"12331090","12335130"," I got a bunch of puts for tomorrow for the 15th two days from now."
"12335130","12339290"," I've got 450 P's a bunch of those two. "
"12339470","12341750"," So I got shit all over the place."
"12342010","12345370"," Whole bunch of crap just sitting in my brokerage."
"12345550","12350030"," If we start making these swings, I'm going to try and close them out one by one. "
"12352170","12353610"," That's so we're at the market right now."
"12360730","12365470"," You figure if you own the market in any way, shape or form, you got a bunch of penny fucking"

"12365630","12368450"," Some you come straight decision forecast. "
"12368830","12370730"," No change on the prior five spot."

"14511400","14514460"," I want to check the SPX gamma picture."
"14514680","14520130"," Let's take a peek at gamma and see what it's saying."
"14527190","14531410"," We still got room up here to run. "
"14531410","14532990"," You see that gamma bar up there."
"14537930","14545610"," SPX 4700 on SPX is the major resistance to the upside here."
"14546450","14553410"," So 4700 on SPX so keep that in mind okay that we can continue to the upside. "
"14555190","14559590"," 4700 on SPX mark that on your charts at home."
"14564570","14566570"," Paul might come in a green suit today."
"14570770","14571950"," You guys are terrible. "
"14572510","14573490"," Just like full green."
"14573910","14575050"," Oh, forget the suit."
"14575190","14577850"," Just like what's the green full suit with the zipper on it. "
"14578210","14580750"," It's just like the gimp suit, but it's just full green."
"14584130","14593930"," See you guys are saying JPM is so bad."

"14597310","14599170"," Does the collar act like a magnet still?"
"14599270","14599950"," It still does."

"14604150","14608470"," You should be asking these questions after the event today. "
"14608790","14609230"," Like tomorrow."
"14609310","14611550"," Ask those questions, but yes, still a magnet."
"14612230","14613070"," Still a magnet. "

"14650370","14650530"," Hold on."
"14650530","14651110"," I got to read this."
"14652410","14655410"," He might walk on to the stage with a top hat and take it off. "
"14655430","14656190"," Take it off for your village."
"14656190","14657790"," I'm sitting under his white here."
"14659990","14661330"," And Vicks barely moving. "
"14662890","14663850"," What else we got here?"

"14676370","14678170"," What else do you guys see me read through some of this?"
"14679070","14680170"," Fuck your puts hat."
"14680290","14683450"," As a matter of fact, let me play something."
"14683730","14683850"," All right. "
"14683930","14684470"," We have time to play."
"14684590","14685230"," We got two minutes left."
"14685390","14685910"," I was going to play. "
"14686490","14687270"," I got to skip."
"14687410","14688130"," No snooze this."
"14689810","14690410"," No ads. "
"14690670","14691210"," I don't want any ads."
"14691250","14693390"," They turn ads off on the live stream here."
"14693510","14694150"," Hold on a minute here. "
"14695250","14699530"," I'm going to pause ads as we're coming into this great decision."
"14700890","14703910"," Presser with Jerome Powell two minutes until he comes on live."
"14703910","14712370"," I want to play Trader Podcasts Jerome Powell meme right now. "
"14712810","14713570"," We don't have time."
"14714010","14714410"," I'll do it."
"14714710","14718050"," I'll do it after the presser or towards the end of the presser. "
"14718130","14724190"," I'll put it on the screen for you so you can check out Trader Podcasts meme from Jerome Powell."
"14724710","14726070"," I should have played it."
"14726290","14729730"," I should have played it like 10 minutes ago. "
"14735720","14739780"," Remember, 4,700 on SPX, 4,700 on SPX."
"14745000","14746860"," We hit Valhalla, baby."
"14747880","14749160"," That's all I wanted to see. "
"14750320","14752420"," But this is all I cared about."
"14753360","14755140"," We checked out the prior high."
"14755860","14757580"," You haven't been waiting for this for how long now?"
"14758160","14759340"," How long have you been waiting for this?"
"14759960","14761440"," Was it January 7th, maybe?"
"14762880","14763580"," It's a long time. "
"14763980","14766420"," If you're a bull out there, long fucking time."
"14767040","14769580"," I've got a whole bunch of other stuff to talk to you guys about."
"14771460","14773320"," This is closing the door. "
"14774660","14776360"," This is closing the door."
"14777200","14787200"," If you had a low in October, that 3500 low in October of 2023, you're seeing happening right"
"14787200","14788540"," now in real time."
"14789800","14794180"," If you remember back when we were making videos then, what did we say?"
"14794820","14795880"," Set it on Twitter. "
"14796460","14797140"," Set it on video."
"14797680","14798220"," Set it everywhere."
"14798600","14799480"," Set it in private videos. "
"14799760","14800300"," Set it in Discord."
"14801120","14801580"," What did we say?"
"14802700","14807820"," We said, you should buy this even if we return here."
"14808680","14813040"," And you have a prior probability of never returning here. "
"14813680","14814660"," So you buy it."
"14815480","14815880"," Okay?"
"14816280","14817080"," You don't want to miss it."
"14818500","14822420"," And if you bought it, congratulations to you for doing that. "
"14823320","14825960"," Now, a second narrative came out."
"14826400","14831080"," And the second narrative was, we're definitely going back to 3500."
"14831420","14832820"," I'll get my chance later. "
"14833580","14834780"," These are the sellers, right?"
"14835380","14836540"," I'll get my chance later."
"14838260","14842140"," The door is being closed to now that statement."
"14842960","14846320"," So they're closing the door to 3500. "
"14846980","14850520"," You're now starting to see 3600."
"14851480","14858960"," If we explode to 4800, you're going to close the door all the way up to 38 and 3900."
"14859380","14862340"," That's going to put us looking down towards 38 to 4000. "
"14865160","14867120"," That sucks for a lot of people out there."
"14867280","14869620"," There are people that made those statements, right?"
"14869840","14873820"," That wasn't the bottom of return in a negative light."
"14874320","14875300"," Not in a positive light. "
"14875420","14876540"," You should have bought 3500."
"14878600","14883300"," Right now, like, start thinking about any kind of pullback we have or crash."
"14884040","14884640"," What is that now?"
"14884880","14886280"," If we get to 1400, that's what?"
"14886640","14890260"," 25, 30% downside move possible. "
"14891120","14891660"," Slim."
"14893140","14894160"," Slim probability."
"14894760","14899400"," So doors closing on that statement, doors closing on three visiting 3500. "
"14901000","14903860"," Bottom looking like worst case scenario, 3600."
"14904380","14910520"," And if we go higher, you're going to start seeing levels like 38, 39, eventually 4000."
"14911440","14917040"," So if we ever go back down to 4000, 3800, you're going to look back at that 3500 and say,"
"14917180","14918520"," I should have bought that fucking bottom. "
"14920100","14926180"," And if we ever have that again, right, slam back down to 38 or 4000, you now know that when"
"14926180","14929380"," you go back there, that you should be buying those bottoms every time."
"14931930","14932750"," Sorry about that."
"14933050","14933510"," Not on. "
"14933610","14934650"," Let me put this back on again."
"14935990","14937270"," You have to still nothing on."
"14937410","14937970"," Still no drone. "
"14939510","14940490"," Still no drone."
"14940930","14941690"," I don't see it here."
"14941790","14944610"," From the outside scene in the third quarter. "
"14945770","14950450"," Even so, GDP is on track to expand around two and a half percent for the year as a whole,"
"14951090","14955210"," bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions."
"14956210","14961270"," After picking somewhat over the up somewhat over the side, activity in the housing sector has"
"14961270","14967110"," flattened and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage"
"14967110","14967770"," rates."
"14968750","14972310"," Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. "
"14973510","14978450"," In our summary of economic projections, committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP"
"14978450","14987730"," growth this year, but expect growth to cool with the median projection falling to 1.4%. The labor"
"14987730","14992290"," market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance."
"14993250","15000250"," Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong case that"
"15000250","15003230"," is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year."
"15004530","15011770"," The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase"
"15011770","15012930"," in the supply of workers. "
"15013370","15019450"," The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged"
"15019450","15021250"," 25 to 54 years."
"15022170","15024890"," And immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels."
"15026170","15030130"," Nominal wage growth appears to be easing and job vacancies have declined. "
"15031710","15037770"," Although the jobs to workers' gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available"
"15037770","15038250"," workers."
"15039850","15045970"," FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue easing upward pressures on"
"15045970","15046210"," inflation."
"15047830","15054770"," The median unemployment rate projection in the SCP rises somewhat from 3.8% at the end of this year"
"15054770","15057370"," to 4.1% at the end of next year. "
"15058650","15063170"," Inflation has eased over the past year, but remains above our longer run goal of 2%."
"15063870","15071270"," Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6% over"
"15071270","15077110"," the 12 months ending in November, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core"
"15077110","15084770"," PCE prices rose 3.1%. The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we"
"15084770","15089270"," will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably"
"15089270","15090010"," toward our vote."
"15090050","15093330"," That red bar down below is the 47th hundred gamble bar. "
"15093750","15097350"," So that red bar that you can see down there because you're reflecting in a broad range of surveys"
"15097350","15102390"," of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets."
"15104270","15109590"," As is evident from the SCP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2%"
"15109590","15110370"," will take some time."
"15110370","15117590"," The median projection in the SCP is 2.8% this year, falls to 2.4% next year, and"
"15117590","15119850"," reaches 2% in 2026. "
"15121250","15126430"," The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and"

"15129130","15134710"," My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes"
"15134710","15140550"," purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher cost of essentials like food,"
"15140970","15142030"," housing and transportation."
"15143810","15149610"," We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we"
"15149610","15152370"," are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. "
"15154970","15162270"," As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25% points, and"
"15162270","15165370"," we have decreased our securities holdings by more than a trillion dollars."
"15166690","15171970"," Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and"

"15178670","15184630"," 5.25 to 5.5%. And to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. "
"15185210","15190470"," Like all the electricity up here, we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for"
"15190470","15191410"," this tightening cycle."
"15191410","15199170"," The economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward"
"15199170","15201510"," our 2% inflation objective is not assured."
"15202810","15205630"," We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. "
"15206230","15210990"," We're committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring"
"15210990","15216930"," inflation sustainably down to 2% over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we're confident"

"15254530","15261470"," of 2025, and 2.9% at the end of 2026, still above the median longer term rate."

"15370530","15378450"," So, specifically on any, we do say that in determining the extent of any additional policy firming"
"15378450","15381650"," that may be appropriate, so any additional policy firming in that sense."
"15382450","15388210"," So we added the word any as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the"
"15388210","15389950"," peak rate for this cycle. "
"15391270","15394770"," Participants didn't write down additional hikes that we believe are likely."
"15394770","15397230"," So, that's what we wrote down."
"15397230","15403410"," 469, 1, 0.90. I didn't want to take the possibility for the hikes off the table. "
"15403610","15405290"," So that's really what we're looking for."
"15405770","15406490"," Scratch that."
"15409570","15410970"," Oh, my God, sorry. "
"15411510","15414550"," Steve Lee's been seeing a happy holidays, Mr. Chairman."
"15415570","15422090"," The Fed Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next"
"15422090","15424650"," several months could be cutting interest rates."
"15424650","15429930"," I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with a Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed"
"15429930","15432810"," would become more restrictive if it didn't cut rates of inflation fell. "
"15432950","15433310"," Thank you, sir."
"15434690","15439530"," So, of course, I don't comment on any other officials, even those who work at the Fed."
"15440950","15443570"," So, but I'll try to answer your question more broadly. "
"15444790","15447490"," So, the way we're looking at it is really this."
"15448390","15454550"," When we started out, right, we said the first question is how fast to move, and we move very fast."
"15454750","15460350"," The second question is, you know, really how high to raise the policy rate. "
"15460750","15463030"," And that's really the question that we're still on here."
"15463450","15464990"," We're both focused on that."
"15465190","15472250"," As I mentioned, people generally think that we're at or near that, and think it's not likely that"
"15472250","15474490"," we will hike, although they don't take that possibility. "
"15474490","15481210"," When you get to that question and that's your answer, there are like 27 cents a little bit ago."
"15481690","15486970"," Naturally, it begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin"
"15486970","15489630"," dialing back the amount of policy restraint that's in place."
"15490010","15491310"," So, that's really the next question. "
"15491570","15495150"," And that's what people are thinking about and talking about."
"15495290","15496310"," And I would just say this."
"15497510","15502590"," We are seeing a strong growth that appears to be moderating. "
"15502630","15506430"," We're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures."
"15506430","15508170"," And we're seeing inflation making real progress."
"15508170","15510230"," These are the things we've been wanting to see. "
"15510810","15511690"," We can't know."
"15512130","15513170"," We still have a ways to go."
"15513370","15514350"," No one is declaring victory. "
"15514610","15515110"," That would be premature."
"15516010","15517990"," And we can't be guaranteed this progress."
"15518270","15522850"," So, we're moving carefully and making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not. "
"15525530","15527690"," And that's really the question that we're on."
"15528050","15534210"," But of course, the other question, the question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing"
"15534210","15537970"," back the amount of policy restraint in place that begins to come."
"15539150","15541090"," And is clearly a discussion topic. "
"15541110","15542170"," I'm going to slide that bar up there."
"15542170","15545790"," And also a discussion for us at our meeting today."
"15545790","15549050"," More 69, 5, 6, 9, just four more points left to go. "
"15549050","15550370"," Thank you."
"15550470","15550950"," Sure."
"15551450","15554490"," So, it comes up in this way today. "
"15555050","15557210"," Everybody wrote down an SCP forecast."
"15557830","15561490"," So, many people mentioned what their rate forecast was."
"15563110","15567590"," And there was no back and forth, no attempt to reach agreement. "
"15567590","15568870"," Like, this is what I wrote down."
"15568990","15569530"," This is what I think."
"15569710","15570230"," That kind of thing. "
"15571250","15573070"," And close to that gamma bar."
"15573190","15574750"," Real close to that gamma bar."
"15574830","15575630"," Not everybody did that. "
"15575770","15576530"," But many people did."
"15576690","15581290"," And then, and I would say there's a general expectation that this will be a topic for us."
"15581870","15582170"," Looking ahead. "
"15582790","15584430"," That's really what happened in today's meeting."
"15584690","15586790"," I can't do the head count for you in real time."
"15586870","15588110"," But that's generally what happened today. "
"15593220","15593980"," Hi, Chair Powell."
"15594160","15595400"," Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post."
"15595620","15596540"," Thanks for taking your questions. "
"15597220","15603660"," At this point, can you confidently say the economy has a greater recession and isn't heading for"
"15603660","15604160"," one now?"
"15604840","15606900"," And if the answer is no, I'm curious about what you'd say."
"15607020","15609180"," Four points left to go to slap 4,700."
"15610260","15615740"," I think you can say that there's little basis for thinking that the economy is in a recession now. "
"15617520","15618480"," I would say that."
"15619180","15625540"," I think there's always a probability that there will be a recession in the next year."
"15625540","15628340"," It's a meaningful probability, no matter what the economy is doing. "
"15628560","15629680"," So it's always a real possibility."
"15630340","15634300"," The question is, is it, so it's a possibility here."
"15634640","15641080"," I have always felt since the beginning that there was a possibility because of the unusual"
"15641080","15642660"," situation. "
"15642860","15644200"," Just heads up there too."
"15644360","15646680"," That's where Wednesday are holding just fine."
"15646940","15649460"," That way it's for today's clicks. "
"15650160","15654340"," Without the cost of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation."
"15655500","15657720"," So far, that's what we're seeing."
"15657900","15660580"," That's what many forecasters on the committee are seeing. "
"15660880","15662360"," This results not guarantee."
"15663040","15665600"," It's far too early to declare victory."
"15666760","15668260"," And there are certainly risks. "
"15668340","15673320"," It's certainly possible that the economy will behave in an unexpected way."
"15673480","15677100"," It is done that repeatedly in the post-pandemic period."
"15677680","15682380"," Nonetheless, where we are is we see the things that I mentioned. "
"15685500","15689220"," You talked about navigating by the stars under cloudy skies."
"15689420","15693480"," Can you talk about some of the ways in which the economy surprised you most this year where you"
"15693480","15695700"," thought it would behave in one way and had to pivot to respond?"
"15696240","15696440"," Thanks."
"15696720","15704660"," So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very broadly forecasting a recession"
"15704660","15708560"," for this year, for 2023. "
"15708560","15713620"," And not only did that not happen, that includes fed forecasters and really essentially all"
"15713620","15714140"," forecasters."
"15714300","15717640"," There's a very high proportion of forecasters who are very weak growth or a recession."
"15717900","15719660"," Ooh, he is smoking people right now. "
"15719880","15721040"," And we actually have very strong here."
"15721600","15724280"," And that was a combination of strong demand."
"15724580","15727120"," But also real gains on the supply side. "
"15727240","15734200"," So this was the year when labor force participation picked up or immigration picked up where the"
"15735020","15740680"," distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic, you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks"
"15740680","15742400"," really began to unwind."
"15742520","15745980"," So we had significant supply side gains with strong demand."
"15746220","15750040"," And we got what looks like a two and a half percent plus or a little more than that growth"
"15750040","15754740"," year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that just because"
"15754740","15756540"," of the healing on the supply side. "
"15756540","15759820"," So that was a surprise to just about everybody."
"15759820","15765820"," I think the inflation forecast is roughly roughly what people wrote down a year ago but in a very"
"15765820","15766420"," different setting."
"15766680","15772140"," And I would say the labor market because of the stronger growth has also been significantly better. "
"15772220","15776300"," If you look back at the SCP from a year ago, there was a significant increase in unemployment."
"15777000","15777880"," It didn't really happen."
"15778060","15785800"," We're still 3.7%. So we've seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market, but one"
"15785800","15790880"," that's coming back into balance with the support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. "
"15791880","15793880"," It's a, you know, that's what we see in that."
"15794140","15797460"," I think that combination was not anticipated broadly."
"15802530","15804450"," Thanks, Howard Schneider with Reuters. "
"15804770","15805910"," And thanks for taking the questions."
"15806530","15811270"," I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what motivates the lower rates next"
"15811270","15817670"," year, whether it's a coincidence, for example, that the spread between PCE inflation, core"
"15817670","15821350"," inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year."
"15821490","15822690"," Are you simply calibrating against the fall in crisis?"
"15822690","15824330"," So let's move reversal in the crisis. "
"15824330","15826630"," The price of the rate is high."
"15827250","15830410"," At 26.90. As opposed to supporting the economy?"
"15832650","15834650"," Nothing quite that mechanical is happening."
"15835130","15838530"," The SCP really is a bottoms up built from the bottom up, right?"
"15838670","15841790"," So I think people are looking at what's happening in the economy. "
"15842110","15848190"," And I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SCP, the expectations for"
"15848190","15853490"," inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, really significantly in"
"15853490","15853930"," three months."
"15854450","15856090"," That's a big piece of this."
"15856610","15862390"," At the same time, growth is, turn out to be very strong in the third quarter, is slowing, we"
"15862390","15863470"," believe, as appropriate. "
"15863810","15867550"," And we've got, we've had several labor market reports which suggest."
"15867830","15870750"," Are any of you guys going to a short 4700?"
"15870750","15871890"," Let me know in the chat."
"15871890","15872810"," A broad range of indicators. "
"15872810","15876610"," You're seeing that so many of the indicators coming back to normal."
"15876810","15878130"," Not too Friday or anything like that."
"15878130","15880530"," So I think that people look at that and they write down there. "
"15880990","15886170"," They basically, each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that"
"15886170","15886490"," forecast."
"15886850","15888750"," We tabulate them and publish it."
"15889910","15894550"," And so it's not, it isn't, you ask about real rates, I take it. "
"15894750","15898890"," You know, that's, that is something that we're very conscious of and aware of."
"15898890","15903590"," And it's certainly a big part of, it's a part of how we think about that."
"15903710","15905690"," It's a really broad range of conditions that matter. "
"15906150","15911490"," And as you well know, it's so hard to know exactly, you know, what the, what the real rate is"
"15911490","15913930"," or exactly how tight policy is at any given time."
"15914010","15920590"," So you couldn't follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all"
"15920590","15920910"," the time."
"15920910","15922390"," But it's certainly something that we're focused on. "
"15922390","15927070"," And indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is"
"15927070","15929390"," declining as we, as we move forward."
"15929810","15933630"," It sounds like the discussion over that I could follow up has already kind of begun."
"15934450","15940690"," I'm wondering, just related to Steve's question, how the tactics of this play out, given the"
"15940690","15945510"," slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 2024, the closer you get to a"
"15945510","15946430"," presidential election. "
"15947030","15948810"," Do you want to front load this, in other words?"
"15950010","15953750"," Yeah, no, we, we're, we don't think about political events."
"15953950","15954790"," We don't think about politics."
"15954790","15957010"," We think about what's the right thing to do for the economy. "
"15957170","15958910"," And then we start thinking about those things."
"15959850","15961430"," You know, we just can't do that."
"15961530","15962730"," We have to think, what's the right thing?"
"15962990","15968490"," We'll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time we, when we think is"
"15968490","15969010"," the right time. "
"15969210","15970390"," That's what we'll always do."
"15970810","15972530"," So I mentioned we're moving carefully."
"15972890","15977350"," One of the things we're moving carefully about is that decision over that assessment really over"
"15977350","15979290"," where we've done enough, really. "
"15979990","15982750"," And you see that people are not writing down rate hikes."
"15983070","15988910"," That's, that's us thinking that we have done enough, but not, not feeling that really strongly"
"15988910","15992650"," confidently and not wanting to take the possibility of a rate hike off the table."
"15992650","15997590"," Nonetheless, it's not the base case anymore, obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago. "
"15998110","16000910"," So that's, that's how we're, that's how we're approaching things."
"16001210","16006470"," And, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SCP and it talks about it."
"16007150","16012930"," People have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start to dial"
"16012930","16015450"," back on, on the type policy we have in place. "
"16015650","16017850"," And that's a discussion we'll be having going forward."
"16018050","16021710"," But that's another assessment that we're going to make very carefully."
"16023610","16025210"," So as time goes forward. "
"16032570","16034130"," Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal."
"16034130","16039650"," Chair Powell, you've argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually"
"16039650","16043730"," lifted off because the market anticipated moves and tightened on your behalf."
"16044450","16049310"," The market is now easing policy on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September. "
"16049870","16053170"," That's a full point below the current level with cuts beginning around March."
"16053930","16056730"," Is this something that you are broadly comfortable with?"
"16057950","16059810"," They're looking to push us over, man."
"16059810","16065870"," So this, this last year has been remarkable for CSA thing back and forth. "
"16066070","16070230"," We've had over the course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of"
"16070230","16070370"," thing."
"16070510","16076910"," So, and what I would just say is that we, we focus on what we have to do and how"
"16076910","16078910"," we need to use our tools to achieve our goals."
"16079770","16081530"," And that's what we really focus on. "
"16081910","16084770"," And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy."
"16084770","16090290"," And they're going to, those are going to show up in market conditions or they won't."
"16090610","16094030"," But in any case, we have to do what we think is right. "
"16094650","16101070"," And in the long run, it's important that financial conditions become aligned or are aligned with"
"16101070","16102070"," what we're trying to accomplish."
"16102330","16107490"," And in the long run, they will be, of course, because we will do what it takes to get to"
"16107490","16107790"," our goals."
"16108750","16111510"," And ultimately, that will mean that financial conditions will come along. "
"16111510","16117010"," But in the meantime, there can be back and forth and, you know, I'm just focused on what's the"
"16117010","16117970"," right thing for us to do."
"16118090","16119470"," And my colleagues are focused on that, too."
"16119930","16123450"," The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly. "
"16124330","16128150"," Do you believe we're at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?"
"16128850","16130430"," Listen, I, I welcome the progress."
"16130590","16132550"," Next target above 4700."
"16132550","16134310"," It's really good to see the progress that we're making. "
"16134610","16135690"," This 4750."
"16135910","16138370"," I think if you look at the 12 month measure, look at the six month measures."
"16138370","16139890"," You see very low, low numbers. "
"16139890","16143370"," If you look at 12 months measures, you're still well above 2%."
"16143370","16147870"," You're actually above 3% on core through November at PCE."
"16148970","16152410"," That isn't to say, I'm not, you know, calling into question the progress. "
"16152630","16152810"," It's great."
"16152930","16153810"," We just need to see more."
"16153970","16158710"," We need to see, you know, continued further progress toward getting back to 2%. "
"16158710","16159890"," That's what we need to see."
"16160090","16164930"," So, you know, it's our job to restore price stability."
"16164930","16169270"," And that, it's one of our two jobs along with maximum employment and their equal. "
"16169830","16173690"," So, we're very focused on, on, you know, doing that."
"16173950","16175770"," As I mentioned, we're moving carefully at this point."
"16176610","16181290"," We're pleased with the progress, but, but we see the need for further progress. "
"16182110","16187770"," And I think, I think it's fair to say, there is a lot of uncertainty about going forward."
"16187770","16192170"," We've seen the economy move in surprising directions, so we're just going to need to see more for"
"16192170","16193070"," the progress."
"16199610","16201970"," Gina Smilick, New York Times, thanks for taking our questions. "
"16203150","16207330"," In the SCP from today, growth is notably below potential in 2024."
"16207910","16212350"," If growth were to surprise us again, in the way that it has for years now, by being stronger than"
"16212350","16216570"," expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates or put another way?"
"16216850","16217810"," It's below trend growth."
"16217810","16221470"," It's a series of upgrades for what continue progress on inflation alone. "
"16221610","16223210"," It's better for you if you want to take a look at that chart."
"16223210","16225170"," Look at the totality of the data."
"16225170","16230130"," Growth is one thing, so is inflation, so is labor market data. "
"16230470","16235550"," So, we look at the total, as we make decisions about policy changes going forward, we look at all"
"16235550","16238670"," those things, and particularly as they affect the outlook."
"16238850","16242510"," So, it's ultimately all about the outlook and the balance of risks as well."
"16242750","16244370"," So, that's what we'd be looking for. "
"16245190","16250250"," If we have stronger growth, you know, that'll be good for people, that'll be good for the labor"
"16250250","16250530"," market."
"16250530","16254550"," It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2%."
"16254550","16262830"," We will get it down to 2%, but if we see stronger growth, we will set policy according to what"
"16262830","16263650"," we actually see. "
"16264130","16266990"," And so, that's how I would answer."
"16268750","16271830"," I guess the question I'm asking, if you don't mind a quick follow-up, I guess the question I'm"
"16271830","16275350"," asking is, is above trend growth itself a problem?"
"16276170","16278870"," It's only a problem, it's not itself a problem."
"16279190","16283530"," It's only a problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. "
"16284950","16291770"," And if you have growth that's robust, what that will mean is probably will keep the labor market"
"16291770","16292490"," very strong."
"16293030","16295450"," It probably will place some upward pressure on inflation."
"16296350","16299690"," That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2% inflation. "
"16300370","16302690"," That could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer."
"16302690","16305810"," It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again."
"16306970","16309830"," It just is, it's the way the way our policy works. "
"16310950","16312750"," Hold on a second, everyone tell us a second."
"16312990","16315950"," Hi, Chair Powell."
"16316210","16317250"," Neil Irwin with Axios. "
"16317950","16320330"," How do you interpret the state of the labor market right now?"
"16320670","16324750"," And in particular, you've referred even today to evidence that it's coming into better balance."
"16325310","16328690"," What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that balance?"
"16329270","16335430"," So on the better balance side, just a lot of things, you see job growth."
"16335430","16338410"," I'm closing some calls here, and I'm actually about to buy. "
"16338410","16342130"," Moving back down to more sustainable levels given population growth and labor market."
"16342150","16343350"," This is extra money."
"16344350","16348470"," The things that are not going to go on with that list. "
"16348990","16349950"," You know, claims are low."
"16350770","16352330"," If you look at surveys of businesses."
"16353530","16358370"," They're sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage. "
"16358530","16361550"," They're behind us and they're seeing the shortage of labor."
"16361710","16362770"," If you want to see where that is."
"16362770","16368610"," If you look at shortages of workers, where they thought job availability. "
"16369090","16372950"," Job availability was the highest that had ever been or close to it."
"16373250","16376550"," That's down to more normal levels by so many measures."
"16376870","16379670"," Participation employment, so many measures, the unemployment. "
"16380350","16380870"," Job openings."
"16382790","16384230"," I have no longer long."
"16384490","16385570"," I am out right now. "
"16385950","16387710"," I'm still running a bear ball."
"16387869","16389110"," What would be consistent?"
"16389270","16389770"," You got to do it."
"16390070","16391009"," You are that. "
"16391130","16391869"," You are that."
"16391869","16392830"," Gradually cooling off."
"16392990","16394790"," But if wages are running around four percent. "
"16395189","16395950"," You are that."
"16396230","16397450"," But above, I would say."
"16398210","16398730"," You. "
"16399110","16400810"," I guess they're just a couple of other."
"16401029","16401550"," Please."
"16401930","16403930"," The unemployment rate is very, very low. "
"16404750","16405570"," And these are."
"16406150","16406669"," Right there."
"16406669","16410770"," I would just say, overall, the development of the labor market has been very positive. "
"16411150","16416570"," It's been a good time for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases."
"16418590","16419230"," It's great."
"16419630","16420290"," You're way, right?"
"16420490","16421009"," We trade up. "
"16421290","16421950"," Come back down."
"16421950","16422270"," Come back down."
"16423290","16424090"," We hit that one minute trigger. "
"16424310","16425529"," You want to start trade back."
"16425689","16429410"," Yeah, I see the mood among economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is"
"16429410","16438250"," somewhat corroborated by your forecast by the sense that we are going to have a public."
"16438430","16440550"," There's a lot of discord about economic conditions. "
"16440770","16442490"," What do you think explains this?"
"16443330","16445210"," Does it matter for policymakers?"
"16446450","16448470"," Look at that right there."
"16448770","16452230"," It may be a common excuse."
"16452529","16454590"," Support right here. "
"16454790","16456250"," It's coming down."
"16456529","16457430"," That's very good news."
"16458150","16465410"," The price levels are coming down, but overall, you know, you need to get the price levels. "
"16465410","16467869"," So people are still living with people."
"16467869","16469349"," Who pulls the full port 480?"
"16470610","16474470"," That's not something that people don't like."
"16475070","16481630"," And you know, what's what will happen with that is wages are now real wages are now positive. "
"16482009","16485529"," So that wages are now moving up more than inflation as inflation comes down."
"16486430","16487130"," And so that might help."
"16487130","16490669"," Well, try to make your 70 the floor right now. "
"16491090","16494610"," But we do see those public opinion surveys."
"16495009","16504310"," The thing that we can do is to do our job, use our tools to foster price stability, which is"
"16504310","16510310"," a great benefit over a period of time, which is the thing that really enables us to squeeze this"
"16510310","16515150"," off or achieve come back down in just an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial"
"16515150","16519090"," for families and companies around the country."
"16522270","16525130"," Slam it up to 475, come back down. "
"16525470","16526250"," We are with Politico."
"16528490","16534550"," On the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we"
"16534550","16539490"," do start to see on the rise, sort of the levels of inflation that we're seeing now, how would you"
"16539490","16540450"," all think about that?"
"16547210","16553509"," The economy starts to look like it's starting to fall into recession, if the jobless rates starts"
"16553509","16557509"," to rise, that's not something we're hoping to see."
"16557770","16563869"," Obviously, we're hoping to see something very different, which is continuation of what we have seen"
"16563869","16569869"," in the fucking phenomenon, the labor market coming into better balance without a significant"
"16569869","16573849"," increase in unemployment, inflation coming down without a significant increase. "
"16573990","16577930"," If you want to trade this from here to the upside, if you're believing that we can go higher today,"
"16577930","16584910"," take the money and get cheaper, get like a cheaper call package, something like that, 100, 200, 300"
"16584910","16589550"," rack of calls, if you want, throw some fucking lotto's out there, just don't base your whole entire"
"16589550","16593509"," portfolio on us going to 4750 today, okay?"
"16594090","16599710"," The labor day, the time on or something next week, if you want to month out three months out, you"
"16599710","16605290"," can you can describe it personally, what I got to put tomorrow, I got some more bucks that's up"
"16605290","16605450"," there."
"16605669","16612310"," I get some dead zero dates for today, but they cost me zero and they're just a hedge."
"16612790","16614650"," Michael, you're from Bloomberg television radio. "
"16615550","16618490"," Mr Chairman, you were by your own admission behind the curve."
"16619550","16625710"," All time, inflation, and you said earlier again, the full effects of our tightening cycle have not"
"16625710","16626750"," yet been felt."
"16627529","16633310"," How will you decide, baby, when to cut rates and how will you ensure you're not behind the curve?"
"16633550","16634430"," Let's take a look. "
"16637869","16642169"," So we're we're aware of the risk that we would."
"16643529","16644070"," 4818."
"16644410","16645689"," Hang on to 4818. "
"16645689","16651189"," We know that that's a risk and we're 4818 on SPX making that mistake."
"16651910","16655590"," We do regard it to, you know, we've come back into a better balance."
"16655730","16656790"," Let's look at it right now. "
"16656890","16658990"," The risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it."
"16659230","16665529"," Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the price stability mandate, and we're getting back to"
"16665529","16669730"," the point where which is what you do when you're very far from from one of them, one of the"
"16669730","16670130"," two mandates."
"16670590","16670849"," 4818. "
"16670849","16672650"," We're both mandates."
"16672990","16680890"," They're going to make that we'll be very much keeping that in mind as we make policy going forward."
"16681509","16685630"," And the things we'll be looking at, I've already described, you know, we're we're obviously looking"
"16685630","16687869"," at what's happening with demand. "
"16688650","16694310"," And what we see, we see the same thing other people see, which is a strong economy which really put"
"16694310","16696810"," up quite a performance in 2023."
"16697050","16699349"," We see good evidence and good reason."
"16699349","16701869"," There's all time highs that we want to see it. "
"16702029","16702509"," 4818."
"16702509","16703910"," Of course we're coming lower next year."
"16704509","16706110"," And you see what the forecasts are. "
"16706189","16707730"," I think the median growth, median."
"16707890","16707990"," Right."
"16708070","16709430"," Maybe I'll grab some some buzz there. "
"16710410","16711110"," Hold on a second."
"16711330","16711810"," We'll have to see."
"16712430","16713529"," It's very hard to predict. "
"16714250","16718529"," We'll also be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining"
"16718529","16724270"," strong, but ideally with without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens"
"16724270","16724669"," sometimes."
"16727550","16733650"," When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be essentially run the same way you do it now with"
"16733650","16738669"," raising rates where you basically do trial and error cut and see what happens?"
"16739430","16742790"," Or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?"
"16745150","16746650"," We haven't typically tried."
"16746970","16747590"," Yeah, small. "
"16747930","16753189"," This is not 471 specific target levels, which was if you some of you will remember the thresholds"
"16753189","16755590"," that we used in, I guess 2013."
"16756450","16762029"," I don't the answer is these are things that we haven't, you know, really worked out yet."
"16762869","16765430"," We're sort of just at the beginning of of that discussion. "
"16767990","16769310"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"16769529","16770610"," Edward Lawrence of Fox Business."
"16770869","16777470"," So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is showing about 75 basis points, does that signal or"
"16777470","16781630"," that there's a belief of weakness next year in the economy?"
"16783770","16787690"," It wouldn't if that were first of all that let me just say that isn't a plan. "
"16787930","16789930"," That's just accumulating what people wrote down."
"16790030","16793050"," So that's not something you know this, but allow me to say it again."
"16793530","16798590"," We don't debate or discuss what the right, you know, whose scp is right. "
"16798670","16800890"," We just say what they are and we tabulate them and polish them."
"16800990","16806270"," So it's, you know, it's important for people to know that, but it wouldn't need to be a sign of"
"16806270","16806490"," it."
"16806490","16810850"," It could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing and it doesn't need the tight policy. "
"16811210","16814030"," It depends on the economy can evolve in many different ways, right?"
"16814710","16818730"," So but but it could be more what I just described."
"16819030","16820370"," And you focused on core inflation."
"16820710","16823970"," We've heard from in other meetings how sticky is core inflation right now?"
"16825970","16828310"," Well, that's what we're finding out. "
"16828610","16830350"," We've never seen the real progress."
"16831210","16832230"," Holy shit, dude."
"16832230","16837150"," It has been sticky and famously the service after it's like 26 to 39 cents here, but we've actually"
"16837150","16842730"," seen reasonable progress in non housing services, which was the area where you where you would"
"16842730","16844450"," expect to see less progress. "
"16844690","16846110"," We are seeing some progress there though."
"16846350","16851670"," In fact, all three of the categories of core are now contributing goods, housing services, non"
"16851670","16852370"," housing services."
"16852550","16856970"," They're all contributing in different, at different levels, you know, meeting by meeting or rather"
"16856970","16857810"," report by report. "
"16858290","16859450"," So, yeah."
"16861310","16866130"," Katarina, sir, I have a Bloomberg news."
"16866570","16867770"," Thanks for taking our questions. "
"16868690","16876270"," I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this morning"
"16876270","16876730"," and yesterday."
"16877670","16882110"," I'm assuming those were not incorporated into the forecast we see today."
"16882830","16888990"," But I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking, you know, on the"
"16888990","16889910"," inflation outlook. "
"16890390","16890730"," Right."
"16890910","16896130"," So we got we got CPI the morning of the first day and we got PPI the next day, which"
"16896130","16900730"," informs the, you know, the trans translation into PCE."
"16901070","16908730"," So it's very very late in the game, you know, but nonetheless, participants are allowed to"
"16908730","16916690"," encourage to update their SCP forecasts until probably mid morning today after that. "
"16917030","16923910"," So staff has to have that and create the documents that you saw until about mid morning, a little"
"16923910","16925410"," maybe later late morning."
"16926110","16927270"," It's okay to update."
"16927270","16930550"," And I believe some people did update their forecasts based on what we saw today. "
"16931630","16938130"," I mean, how are you when you think about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year"
"16938130","16944690"," or whenever they come, how do you, you know, how do you think about the economy we're in now kind"
"16944690","16945570"," of post pandemic?"
"16945730","16949970"," Do you think that there's been significant structural shifts and is that going to change how you"
"16949970","16952290"," look at a rate cut path?"
"16955370","16960550"," The question of whether there have been fundamental structural shifts is a really hard to know the"
"16960550","16962370"," answer in a very interesting one right now."
"16962510","16968870"," The one that would affect one that comes to mind though is just the question of where the neutral"
"16968870","16969890"," rate of interest is."
"16970750","16975150"," And so for example, if it's risen, and I'm not saying that it has, but if it were to have"
"16975150","16980070"," risen, that would mean that that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey the"
"16980070","16981310"," same level of restriction. "
"16981970","16985590"," The thing is we're not really going to know that, you know, people will be writing papers about"
"16985590","16987790"," that 10 years from now and still fighting about it."
"16988170","16990070"," So it's just that it's going to be uncertain."
"16990350","16995130"," So we're going to be making policy and this is difficult, uncertain, really unprecedented"
"16995130","16995930"," environment. "
"16996570","16998830"," Let's talk about the same person of the year running out."
"16999010","17005130"," Jay Powell, I agree, man, whether it holds true or not, and you're going to see that talk."
"17005330","17006270"," Our answer is to talk to monkey. "
"17006730","17007170"," Absolutely."
"17007650","17008990"," Whether it's true or not."
"17009170","17013330"," One of the reasons why we slowed down this year, we started slowing down at this meeting last year,"
"17013930","17017410"," reducing the pace of which we were adding restriction. "
"17018570","17023050"," And over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those legs time to work."
"17023850","17028270"," In terms of demand has demand shifted more away from services into goods."
"17028830","17035130"," You can make a case for that that the shift back into services has not been complete and it doesn't"
"17035130","17035870"," look like it's on. "
"17036050","17036870"," Yeah, I see that too."
"17036970","17041230"," On ES, that swing high on a bliss, but saying yes, still is a little room left to break."
"17041230","17042970"," It's prior swing high to put it. "
"17048020","17050700"," Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance."
"17051200","17056140"," You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to two percent"
"17056140","17056500"," inflation."
"17057100","17061320"," As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at three and a half on core. "
"17061800","17065640"," On a six month annual basis, core PCE is running at two and a half percent."
"17066040","17069860"," Though when you look at super core and shelter, they are of course stickier."
"17070460","17076120"," So when looking at the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to two"
"17076120","17078700"," percent before you consider cutting rates?"
"17081180","17085600"," I mean, the reason you wouldn't wait to get to two percent to cut rates is that policy would be,"
"17085600","17088220"," it would be too late. "
"17088340","17093220"," If we get up here, right, I don't know that we do, but if we get up here, for the"
"17093220","17096280"," huge squeeze, I'll play a slap that ask for you."
"17096560","17100180"," But only if we go up there, I got some, I got some, I got some, I got some lotos"
"17100180","17101520"," for this trade right here there."
"17101880","17103480"," I got a lotos for that happening. "
"17103480","17104640"," I don't know if it's going to happen."
"17104980","17109580"," It takes, it takes a lot of policy to get into the economy."
"17109580","17111180"," It's just a lot of trade. "
"17111300","17112020"," It's very small."
"17112480","17117080"," So I can't give you a precise answer, but if we get the huge squeeze up there, I don't know,"
"17117300","17124940"," and you know, I don't know if we get that, but we'll just let them die on the fucking vine"
"17124940","17125700"," if that happens."
"17126080","17132060"," I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to identify any one precise point. "
"17132880","17137360"," First pullback, check the one minute trigger and I'll bear amount of time."
"17137360","17139740"," Last time we checked it down here, tag the one minute trigger."
"17139940","17141780"," Came straight up, tagged it again. "
"17142100","17143660"," It made another run higher."
"17144860","17147900"," So we'll watch this back check and see what happens here."
"17154380","17156760"," See if this holds on or not. "
"17157440","17163840"," If we do break the one minute trigger, you do know that we're going to see down below here."
"17164680","17166500"," So be careful of this roll over here."
"17166500","17167640"," I'm curious. "
"17168200","17172820"," You don't want to see any kind of this happen here, and then price come back up, and then we"
"17172820","17173920"," start to reject to the downside."
"17174340","17175820"," So just keep your eyes on this whole structure."
"17186380","17190340"," Bears probably getting all fired up here looking for a failure of the one minute trigger. "
"17190960","17193540"," The first factor is just the unwinding of bears."
"17193920","17195860"," Bears are looking for stuff just like this."
"17196680","17201260"," The second thing would be power policy, which we're looking for that right there. "
"17201400","17203320"," They're looking for this right here."
"17204340","17207320"," We thought those two things were going to be necessary."
"17207320","17209180"," So I'd say the last part of your question. "
"17209280","17211380"," We're looking to get underneath right here."
"17211820","17216380"," Looking to come back up right here."
"17216560","17219640"," It may or may not be about different the US economy being different. "
"17219860","17222020"," I think they're looking to blast you straight down here."
"17222020","17225900"," So they're looking to do this to demand overload."
"17226960","17228340"," I don't know if they get it though. "
"17228500","17229240"," They got to get underneath."
"17229580","17234520"," Think about it was a combination of you get you can't have these green bars right here."
"17234520","17235040"," That's bullish. "
"17236120","17238020"," Need to have the bloodletting down."
"17238020","17239400"," You need a bloodletting down here."
"17239460","17241380"," You know, you need a liquidity break. "
"17241620","17243100"," So this is just very unusual."
"17243560","17245620"," So that green bar is not bearish yet."
"17245620","17251320"," You need bread bars underneath a lot of, you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve"
"17251320","17258660"," because you you ran into the limits of capacity at very low level because there weren't workers and"
"17258660","17258880"," because. "
"17258900","17259420"," Come on bears."
"17259420","17260760"," Put your back into it."
"17260880","17262960"," So we we have to do that. "
"17263080","17264220"," Put your bears into it."
"17264900","17265380"," Bears."
"17265520","17267660"," You got gamma on your side back into it. "
"17267860","17272060"," And you know, something like that has happened so far."
"17272240","17274360"," The question is, you know, bears."
"17275040","17276580"," Once once that part of it. "
"17276580","17277260"," Come on bears."
"17277260","17286260"," We definitely think that the that the sort of supply chain and shortages side has some some ways to"
"17286260","17289240"," run because the labor force participation have much more to run."
"17289320","17293840"," It might immigration could help but it may be that at some point you at some point you will run"
"17293840","17297900"," out of the supply side help and then it gets down to demand and it gets bears need that sweet"
"17297900","17299400"," sexy one red bar man. "
"17299400","17300900"," Just push it down one bar."
"17301000","17301500"," Come on bears."
"17301500","17310240"," You got the last so that you'd expect dips to be bought on the hourly trigger. "
"17310500","17312180"," Keeps coming in positive gamut."
"17312380","17312900"," So hourly trip."
"17313020","17318040"," You're looking for a rebuy hourly trigger on some on dip thighs if you're a bull. "
"17318300","17320860"," We we kind of assume that that it will get."
"17320860","17323500"," You should expect all dips to be bought on hourly trigger."
"17325500","17327620"," Half our hourly trigger either or one of the two. "
"17327820","17328200"," Hi chair pal."
"17328380","17329460"," Thanks for taking our questions."
"17329800","17330760"," Megan Cozzello with Baron. "
"17331180","17335800"," I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed's focus now on proceeding carefully and"
"17335800","17340700"," considering rate cuts and can you talk us through what the latest thinking is and has there been"
"17340700","17343900"," any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening at all."
"17346880","17352860"," We're we're not talking about altering the pace of QT right now just to get that out of the way."
"17353280","17358320"," So balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected. "
"17359320","17362180"," What we've been seeing is way down here."
"17362180","17362980"," It'll come up though."
"17363140","17363600"," You can do it. "
"17363760","17364940"," So hourly triggers right here."
"17366360","17372140"," So even if we squeeze up here let's say right and then we bounce around and then as time passes"
"17372140","17377840"," couple hours one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten if that gets bought rip"
"17377840","17384860"," higher or as a result or holding steady at a certain point you know there won't be any more to"
"17384860","17391720"," come out of but there'll be a level that where the reverse reap of facility levels out and at that"
"17391720","17393280"," point reserves will start to come down."
"17393640","17403200"," We you know we still have you know that we intend to reduce our securities holders until we judge"
"17403200","17408700"," that the quantity of apple traded 198 we talked about 200 on apple this morning right the target"
"17408700","17417100"," was 200 they tried to sell 198 first round of sellers came in doesn't mean we won't slam 200 but"
"17417100","17422420"," they did arrive early some shorts did step in on apple at 198 just to heads up you know with"
"17422420","17427160"," with reserves T and X getting just destroyed today. "
"17427160","17432500"," Those reserves there isn't a lot of evidence of that we're watching it carefully and you know so so"
"17432500","17435480"," far we're so far it's working pretty much as expected we can."
"17437340","17441080"," NDX getting a little smacked out on 16 5 70 something."
"17441080","17445280"," Is that time to rethink or are you still going to follow that thinking?"
"17447860","17453940"," HYG dude in straight fucking beast mode today straight beast mode to the upside. "
"17453940","17457440"," He's asking another question I guess you're just hanging dong today."
"17458020","17466560"," Dixie bleeding out on the daily chart at such time in QT which is a tightening action at such time"
"17466560","17472840"," as policy still tight and the answer is it depends on the reason you know if you're if you're"
"17472840","17477660"," you're cutting rates because you're going back to normal apple with a little blood be careful here"
"17477660","17481620"," watch out for a blood watch out for a liquidation break you can imagine to the downside here know"
"17481620","17484960"," what the reason is to know whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time."
"17486380","17497580"," Thanks very much apple coming into its 130 EMA on a one-minute chart looking for a bounce we're"
"17497580","17502440"," all right it's we got there all right let me turn this off really quick he's leaving right now uh"

"17528820","17536680"," well we went into the oppressor conference with Jerome Powell it ended at 3 16 not 4 p.m. so"
"17536680","17541960"," quite early for a press conference he seemed to be taking some kind of a victory lap in that"
"17541960","17551300"," presser he wasn't dressed hawkish and he did switch to the from the hawkish fed to the dumbish fed"
"17551300","17556340"," so we got a dumbish fed in my at least my perspective you can see the squeeze higher from here"
"17556340","17562340"," note that the we are broke we broke through the 4700 gamma bar doesn't mean we're going to hold it"
"17562340","17568060"," you'd need to stay above it for us to begin to build a level there otherwise there's a magnet down"

"19899860","19904540"," for now uh and to me again i keep saying this it's one of those things it reminds me of"
"19904540","19910680"," like 2017 you've finished a year on a massive flourish it was a melt up market early 2018 is where"

"19934720","19939340"," let you all know again Dow Jones industrial average had a new all-time high and could very well"
"19939340","19949080"," close there for the first time ever either anything above 36,799 in change is going to get us to"
"19949080","19954760"," that mark but what do you make of that idea that money is now gotten to go ahead so to"
"19954760","19960900"," speak to come out of cash and into stocks and they go into bonds too but a good enough portion"
"19960900","19964240"," of it is going to come into stocks and that's going to make a difference well think about the"
"19964240","19968300"," reason it went into money markets in the first place it went in because you could get 5% more"
"19968300","19973660"," than 5% in dividends or in a yield with little to no risk so you'd have to convince people"
"19973660","19978080"," to come out of a 5% yield and if that may happen as the two year comes down because"
"19978080","19981680"," it won't be as attractive anymore you have to convince them to come out of a 5% yield with"
"19981680","19987340"," little to no risk into parts of the market I think the expectation on some is parts of the market"
"19987340","19992240"," that are already overvalued I don't think that's going to happen I mean I think you see sort of a"
"19992240","19998060"," slow flood from money markets as rates come down but I think he's right it doesn't all go into tech"
"19998060","20002740"," it doesn't all try to jump on a bandwagon it probably goes into the more attractively area"
"20002740","20006980"," attractively valued areas of the market but we talked about this the last time I was here too"
"20006980","20012420"," that's the tipping point if money comes out of money markets and people have enough risk appetite"
"20012420","20020260"," to deploy it into cyclicals not just utilities not just staples cyclical sectors and credit and"
"20020260","20025680"," high yield then that tips us into maybe we breach the all-time high you've got a rally that looks"
"20025680","20032160"," a lot more durable Josh the Russell better than 3% strain a third percent right now approaching"
"20032160","20040420"," 2000 on the on the Russell 2000 I just think you have a smorgasbord of laggards that are now like"
"20040420","20047100"," almost putting in overtime to try and catch up which is exactly what the thesis on the desk has"
"20047100","20052740"," been really since before Thanksgiving the way that this year would come to an end it's all playing"
"20052740","20058180"," out look internationally look at how European stocks look like they want to finish this year"
"20058180","20064520"," specifically European financials which have no business ever going up rallying like there's no"
"20064520","20072140"," tomorrow then look here stateside you got arc up 3% today you got biotech up 3% today the"
"20072140","20078920"," businesses underlying those those stocks are not rate sensitive the stocks are rate sensitive and"
"20078920","20084620"," they are moving metals and mining up 3% of the day today I mentioned all the dividend payers these"
"20084620","20090060"," have been lagging sectors all year and in some cases sectors where there's been a lot of pain"
"20090060","20096300"," utilities have been absolutely awful but they pay a yield yields are coming down in risk-free"
"20096300","20103160"," therefore you are going to see rotation into those high dividend payers or the dividend growth"

"20113960","20119960"," yeah I honestly a lot of folks for good reason thought it'd be sticky in the 410 to 390 area"
"20119960","20125040"," we'll see if that does hold it is interesting as Liz said you would expect maybe some re-steeping"

"20267680","20273900"," the data made it untenable for him to stay quite so hawkish as he was for example just a couple"
"20273900","20278520"," weeks ago in an interview that he did I also think he was losing his committee I think the"
"20278520","20285220"," committee has was moving on and acknowledging this notion that if it didn't start to forecast rates"

"20290700","20296380"," dissent on the committee that that was going to I think ultimately hurt policy I do want to I don't"
"20296380","20301000"," know what to say throw a little cold water on this if I could for a second Morgan if you"
"20301000","20309120"," do the math the Fed is not projecting that it's going to get any easier next year okay what the"
"20309120","20315320"," Fed is going to do is it sees itself bringing down interest rates exactly in line with the decline"
"20315320","20323320"," in inflation if you do the simple math of the expected funds rate this year minus the core PCE next"
"20323320","20328920"," year this year you come up with a 2.2% real rate guess what the real rate that you"
"20328920","20335260"," would project from the new SCP is it's 2.2% next year now you could be happy because there's"
"20335260","20341140"," scope for the Fed to come down more and become less restrictive but at the moment the only declines"
"20341140","20348140"," built in there are the Fed moving down in concert with the inflation numbers yes they've taken off"
"20348140","20353900"," the table the notion that there could be additional hikes I mean they're at least notionally off"
"20353900","20358320"," the table he didn't completely back off that but in general what's happening here is the Fed is"
"20358320","20363800"," coming down along with inflation it does not see itself necessarily on average getting any easier"
"20363800","20370240"," next year okay love the context and the nuance there David want to get your thoughts on this what"
"20370240","20375800"," what the dot plot signals to you especially as we did see not just a rally in stocks but a"
"20375800","20380880"," rally in treasuries as well with yields dropping pretty dramatically lowest for the tenure treasury"
"20380880","20387660"," yields since August yeah and a rally in credit as well credit did great I think that look from when"
"20387660","20391840"," I first saw the dot plot and I saw that the PC Court only come down two tenths but the"
"20391840","20397520"," Fed funds rate came down 50 basis points for the end of 2024 I was a little surprised but then"
"20397520","20402140"," listening to Jay I think I I understood where his head was and maybe where others on the committee"
"20402140","20406680"," are they're really watching inflation expectations and inflation expectations dropped dramatically"
"20406680","20411800"," in the last few months we had a break even 10 year at two and a half percent that's now"
"20411800","20417620"," 2.15 percent fallen 35 basis points so I think they're looking closely in inflation expectations"
"20417620","20424760"," and that really added and probably got us that extra 25 basis points of projected rate cut in 2024"
"20424760","20430280"," which was the fuel for the market I think that's where the market really wanted to go that's where"
"20430280","20437040"," the market wanted to see the Fed basically going fully into three rate cuts for next year and and"
"20437040","20442780"," that just set us off and set us off in bonds credit and end stocks for Goldie Ox Valley it's"
"20442780","20449140"," a lot of action there okay okay Steve Leastman let's see if I can warm up the cold water that"
"20449140","20455000"," you just threw on this because it seems like in a way the chair Powell was saying it's working"
"20455000","20459300"," right like so many people were saying oh the Fed doesn't know what it's doing it's way behind the"
"20459300","20465220"," ball on this it's it didn't hike soon now it's hiking too fast blah blah blah blah and now it"
"20465220","20472220"," seems like the Fed that was so hesitant to say we're getting in inflation under control it looks"
"20472220","20480740"," like we might actually achieve a soft landing etc etc it sounds like maybe not dovish but at least"
"20480740","20488080"," open to multiple types of birds yes yeah well let me just be clear John the amount of cold water"
"20488080","20492740"," I'm throwing matters only to the extent that the fire is burning hot and I don't really I don't"
"20492740","20496460"," think it's gonna have that much of an effect and I'll add to what you said I agree completely with"
"20496460","20501180"," what you said that the other thing that's sort of taken off the table here is this idea that we're"
"20501180","20507660"," about to screw up massively and keep things too tight and create a recession before it's too late I"
"20507660","20514180"," think that that is something that a potential risk is eased a little bit today he did talk a lot"
"20514180","20518940"," about being aware of the risk of doing too much he's talked about that before but I think he"
"20518940","20525060"," underscored that I also think that today was you know a day when when the Fed pivoted but didn't do"
"20525060","20529700"," so with any there were no balloons there were no party hats there were no kazoos or anything like"
"20529700","20533980"," that it just said you know what we're taking that other one off the table we are in neutral now"
"20533980","20539620"," with a forecast to cut and those cuts are still speculative in the sense that the inflation data"
"20539620","20543840"," has to behave and come down I think he got to a point where all of it added up if"
"20543840","20547640"," you make a list and say here's all the reasons I should cut and here's all the reasons I should"
"20547640","20552960"," hike that the hike the hike reasons got to be fewer and fewer along the line and became a weaker"
"20552960","20558400"," and weaker argument okay now I do want to mention adobe earnings are out the initial move is down"
"20558400","20564340"," about 7% or more at the moment we are going through those numbers and we'll bring them to you"
"20564340","20571000"," as soon as we can David Zervos is there a risk here after this move higher this high on the"
"20571000","20580680"," Dow S&P above 4700 that there aren't enough people bearish on the other side of this trade anymore"
"20580680","20588680"," and think could be getting out of out of balance heading into 2024 you know I do think people came"
"20588680","20592740"," into this year underweight John they were underweight credit risk they were underweight equity risk"
"20592740","20596580"," they've been chasing it all year look I think Jay said this actually in the press conference when"
"20596580","20601060"," he asked why did everybody get it wrong and he talked a lot about the supply side he talked a"
"20601060","20605820"," lot about vertical supply curves and the fact that the inflation shock was a supply driven shock"
"20605820","20611680"," and the unwind of it was a was a positive supply shock and with it's been our view all along"
"20611680","20617460"," and I really think that story that in the fact that it could continue is something the market"
"20617460","20621840"," doesn't have priced at all people came in wrong footed to this year there's a lot of people still"
"20621840","20625960"," talking about recessions and they don't have a lot of credit risk they don't have a lot of equity"
"20625960","20632120"," market risk you're absolutely right I think John I think there's a real reason why you could have"
"20632120","20638100"," some legs in the risk asset trade on all sides on the on the credit side and on the equity"
"20638100","20641760"," side going into the end of the year and even in the beginning and next year and I really think"
"20641760","20647800"," Jay's story is a pretty good story for risk assets all around it's a it's a soft landing it's a"
"20647800","20654020"," calibrated cut as Steve was saying really to calibrate real rates so they're not getting more"
"20654020","20659200"," restrictive and it's a it's a story that's not the one that a lot of others who were forecasting"
"20659200","20665840"," rate cuts called for it's not a recession rate cut story it's actually kind of a positive just get"
"20665840","20671300"," things back to neutral or keep things in check kind of rate cut story and that should be pretty"
"20671300","20675180"," good for the equity market and I think great for the credit markets too because yields will be"
"20675180","20680560"," coming down in that firearms so so is that where you would be investing right now in the credit"
"20680560","20685380"," market and inequities how would you know more specifically you know more than we've been advocating"
"20685380","20689160"," the junk farm trade all year that's been you know I've been on your show talked about that a lot"
"20689160","20693160"," been a lot of others you know that's been a great tight up double digits this year with a much"
"20693160","20699020"," better sharp ratio than equities I look I am tempted after this meeting and after watching Jay to"
"20699020","20702860"," be a lot more amenable to the equity side of the equation going into next year I haven't taken the"
"20702860","20707040"," full plunge I like where I was in junk credit and I think we've had a great run with it"
"20707040","20712960"," but you know a lot of things are adding up that Jay's view and the the committee's view really of"
"20712960","20720060"," a relatively benign growth story 1.4 1.5% GDP growth inflation heading back down to you know the"
"20720060","20726120"," low twos and a fed that's slowly rate lowering rates you know that's kind of a pretty positive"
"20726120","20732120"," story all around for for all the risk assets base and and as John was pointing out I think in"
"20732120","20736400"," his question there's a lot of people that don't have it and we just came into this here with people"
"20736400","20742360"," overweight duration risk and overweight a kind of negativity that I've had to overcome in a lot of"
"20742360","20749080"," client meetings and I don't think they've gotten that back so I'm much more open to being even a"
"20749080","20753740"," little riskier than we were throughout this year in junk bonds and maybe going even a little more"
"20753740","20759440"," into the the nether reaches of the capital structure of US economy which involves equities yeah"
"20759440","20763760"," Steve I mean we had CPI yesterday maybe you could call it a little bit warmer than expected but"
"20763760","20771420"," largely in line PPI today came in flat month or month over month core PPI was also in change you"
"20771420","20776180"," take all of that you take some of these other inflation expectations that we've gotten in recent"
"20776180","20781440"," reports has it set us up for PC and how much is that going to matter for the Fed as"
"20781440","20787020"," we do head into a 2024 where that so-called last mile of inflation is going to be at least"
"20787020","20793640"," if history has has anything to show us the trickiest yeah all good questions Morgan I mentioned it"
"20793640","20798280"," a 30 when the number came out I mentioned it again at noon and then I was flatter that Powell"
"20798280","20805680"," mentioned it again at his press conference the PPI number does flatter the potential for the PCE"
"20805680","20810380"," number next week and you do see some of those estimates coming down or those with lower estimates"
"20810380","20815880"," we're affirming it you know I was listening to David and nobody does better I think it connecting"
"20815880","20822000"," markets with Fed policy than he than he does and I'm just and by the way I do want to"
"20822000","20828420"," point out Jeff Gunlock in the last hour he had the Fed cutting more because he believes there's a"
"20828420","20832520"," recession coming that I think that was important to point out that's the other side of the story"
"20832520","20837740"," from what David's talking about but I wonder if there's a third possibility here which is that the"
"20837740","20844560"," Fed just cuts more because on a real basis it doesn't have to be that restrictive that there's no"
"20844560","20851760"," particular reason to maintain that 2.2 percent real rate or a 4.6 percent rate if inflation comes"
"20851760","20858780"," down and does does better the next year the way it's done better this year so I there were five"
"20858780","20864560"," members who were calling for a hundred basis points or cuts of cuts or more I call them the"
"20864560","20869620"," dissenting dots out there I think they're a little bit more dovish out there and we'll see if their"
"20869620","20873680"," call ends up being justified or backed up or supported by the data. "
"20874360","20879760"," Big day for the markets the Dow up 500 plus Steve Leesman and David Zervos thank you both I"
"20879760","20884180"," mentioned Adobe earnings are out that stock is down more than 7 percent right now and over time if"
"20884180","20885320"," the Stevens has the numbers."
"20885760","20890480"," That's right John the stock is down on a weak guidance but starting here with Adobe's Q4 results"
"20890480","20896540"," the company did beat on the top and bottom line earning four 27 per share adjusted that was 13"
"20896540","20902300"," cents ahead of estimates revenue coming in at 5.05 billion that was slightly ahead of expectations"
"20902300","20908860"," but once again it is that light guidance so for full year 2024 the company sees revenue between 21 "
"20908860","20916280",".3 and 21.5 billion while Wall Street was looking for 21.73 billion the conference call does kick"
"20916280","20920340"," off at 5 p.m. and right now shares are down about 7 percent back to you."
"20920340","20925380"," All right Pippa Stevens thank you Morgan we said yesterday on overtime watch out for a conservative"
"20925380","20931020"," guide on Adobe but there's more to it I think than just conservatism here because if you look"
"20931020","20938140"," through the numbers the digital media business for Q4 actually came in slightly above the guidance"
"20938140","20943440"," and possibly above where some were expecting a 3.72 billion it was the digital experience line of"
"20943440","20951560"," business that came in even a white really of guidance at 1.12 billion from to my eye and digital"
"20951560","20957360"," experience is that part of the business that's taking data within a business and the business"
"20957360","20963980"," itself uses that to get smarter about its operations and about dealing with customers that's really"
"20963980","20972400"," a very enterprisey piece of what Adobe does with data also in the Q1 guide you've got the overall"
"20972400","20978940"," revenue yes is a little bit life but the digital media expectation was for 3.84 billion the guide"
"20978940","20988120"," is to is to let's see I think right about that number being a little higher and the digital"
"20988120","20995980"," experience business again expectation was for 1.3 billion they're guiding to just under 1.3 on"
"20995980","21001780"," digital experience so it seems to be that enterprise data digital experience piece of the business"
"21001780","21006820"," where demand is lighter which is some of what we saw from Oracle yesterday we're wondering which"
"21006820","21013420"," side was going to win out at least on the operational numbers and on the guide it seems like that"
"21013420","21017360"," weakening demand in enterprise is affecting Adobe's number when we start talking about some of the"
"21017360","21021620"," gen AI tools that they've been rolling out this year things like Firefly where does that fit into"
"21021620","21026000"," the segment breakdown that's in the part that's strong you're going to see that in digital media"
"21026000","21031120"," right that's the efficiency piece of the story that we were talking about where some companies have"
"21031120","21038480"," been winning but we'll have to see what the color is on the call as well it seems like at"
"21038480","21043880"," least the losses in the shares after hours are moderating a bit it's now down a little bit less"
"21043880","21049480"," than 7 percent let's bring in senior markets commentator Mike Santoli now the broader look at the"
"21049480","21055740"," inflation picture Mike yeah John the market more emphatically treating inflation as last year's"
"21055740","21060520"," problem yesterday's problem David Zervos talked about inflation expectations here's where market"
"21060520","21065620"," implied 10-year inflation expectations look like pretty much almost normalized back down toward the"
"21065620","21072060"," 2 percent level which we had seen largely pre-COVID so it seems like there's really nothing to be"
"21072060","21075880"," concerned about here don't write this in ink in terms of what inflation is going to be over the"
"21075880","21080270"," next 10 years it's not necessarily the most solid forecast but it shows you that right now"
"21080270","21084390"," investors are not queued up for more inflation they're not going to behave as if it's coming that's"
"21084390","21089090"," good news for the Fed it endorses their new pivot if that's what we're going to call today's action"
"21089090","21094950"," now what do stocks do after the Fed pauses at this point looks like the Fed's pause from July is"
"21094950","21099990"," the end of that tightening cycle and that would be this mark right here vertical line so this is"
"21099990","21104370"," the current path of the market that was before today's rally so call it right up just a little bit"
"21104370","21109590"," higher from there and you see that if we don't get a recession over the next let's say six to"
"21109590","21115410"," 12 months this has been the average path of the S&P subsequent to that and of course the lower"
"21115410","21120270"," line was if there were a recession resulting after the end of the tightening second course the Fed"
"21120270","21125490"," will have cut before that happens too usually and you see why it matters so much as to whether we"
"21125490","21130650"," get the so-called soft landing or hard landing now there's a variation around each of these lines"
"21130650","21137630"," for example 2007 the market did really quite well in the year almost a year after the Fed paused"
"21137630","21141710"," but then of course it fell apart in the financial crisis so this is the crux of the debate from"
"21141710","21147270"," here on out of course markets are feeling very comfortable economy is pretty sturdy and the Fed now"
"21147270","21155850"," has backed away where do you think traders are seeing the greater danger now is it in a recession"
