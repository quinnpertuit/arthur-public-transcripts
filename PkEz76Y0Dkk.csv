"PkEz76Y0Dkk","0","15960"," All right, let's see if we're back on again or not just kind of fucked up like I don't"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","15960","25040"," know what the fuck is going on here, but I want to restore pages."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","25040","29760"," I do want to restore pages not those pages."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","29760","44080"," We're listening to trade the news that's 24 hours a day, but still can't hear."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","44080","49680"," Smashing in fashion."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","49680","56280"," Yeah, I'm still having, I'm having, I'm still having issues."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","56280","64480"," I'm still having technical fucking difficulties still."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","64480","70000"," My last chance is going to be, my last chance is going to be a new power supply."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","70000","81120"," Winky was saying earlier that he had to take his glass case off."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","81120","83480"," So maybe that's what I'll do."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","83480","92360"," Maybe I'll take the glass case off and see if it's just getting too hot in there."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","92360","95120"," Maybe that's why it's turning off, but if it isn't, it's probably the power supply,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","95120","96120"," which is going to fuck me."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","96120","101960"," Not fuck me, but I'm going to drop it off and have him put a power supply in for me."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","101960","102960"," So let's see what's going on here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","102960","103960"," I'll take a quick look."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","103960","111680"," We got a bounce here, right, bounce here below, bounce, bot right away."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","111680","115280"," We know we have some resistance above here at R2 at 445."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","115280","120080"," You can see his resistance here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","120080","124080"," Yeah, plus this like whole CVP and COP."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","124080","129040"," This is all fucked up."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","129040","134880"," Current order book."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","134880","159200"," Not timing sales, but some weirdness going on here, not on the Y."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","159200","182000"," This price I got above is 444.63 current order book, extended show aggregate."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","182000","183960"," There we go."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","183960","187120"," There we go."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","187120","188120"," That's better."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","188120","191360"," Spires are in control right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","191360","199240"," We are looking for a price target above a 444.70."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","199240","205280"," And then all the way to 446."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","205280","209200"," We'll show that back over here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","209200","211880"," So right up here, right up in here, this is your first wall here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","211880","213480"," Bottom wall is 446 above it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","213480","217400"," This next blue line."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","217400","224160"," Going right back here, level of support."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","224160","226160"," We're looking for this zone here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","226160","232520"," So I can show it to you on a larger timeframe."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","232520","234480"," You can see some resistance right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","234480","239900"," If you do get a break, so there's some resistance here and there's resistance here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","239900","247620"," If we do begin to sell down, you'll be looking to buy this right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","247620","258540"," Now if we break through, if we break through this here, right, one, two, next move higher"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","258540","262540"," to 450."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","262540","268100"," So I'll bring this, we'll make this smaller here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","268100","270300"," You can already see we're testing."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","270300","272660"," Yeah, buyer's just stepping in right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","272660","275460"," Here indicator is green or yellow."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","275460","280340"," A little bit of curling over some more put buyers stepping in right at 935 some put buyers."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","280340","281900"," I noticed it too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","281900","293860"," I do want you to be aware that I noticed some put buyers are loading up on April 13th,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","293860","297100"," 437Ps."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","297100","303140"," They're going for 59 cents right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","303140","309180"," I don't know that I'm ready to buy puts right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","309180","314500"," It doesn't look to me like the bears are in control currently."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","314500","320140"," Now expect some profit taking from call buyers as we approach higher here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","320140","325820"," You'll see, you'll see right in here some resistance."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","325820","329940"," Let's see it's showing up right here as I bring this down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","329940","337100"," You see this resistance down in here, but it's still not overpowering, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","337100","348260"," The bears really want to be selling above 4, 4, 6, 5, somewhere up in here, 4, 4, 6, 5,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","348260","360580"," somewhere up into this vicinity and even then, there's 450, it's a real seller's"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","360580","363580"," are, 452."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","363580","377780"," Yeah, somewhere in there, a line in the sand, 456, so if you want to go real high, 456."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","378780","386620"," So we'll take a look at that again real quick."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","386620","389220"," So you get that mark right here, 450 or so, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","389220","391620"," So this would be R3 here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","391620","400260"," You can draw that."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","400260","403860"," R3."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","403860","409460"," And then 456 is the upper bounds."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","409460","414340"," So if you had like a sell the news kind of a thing, you're like, I'm out of here, right"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","414340","419420"," here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","419420","428340"," That's the take the money and run number right here, 456, put that one there, so you guys"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","428340","431820"," can see it, R1, R2, R3, R4."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","431820","439300"," If it's a good day, you're getting a 456, a little bit higher, there you go."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","439300","444620"," So if you're a bull, if you're a bear want a position, 1, 2, 3, 4, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","444620","455100"," A, B, C, or A, maybe A, B, and then off, fuck the squeeze and then down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","455100","464820"," Oh, yeah, baby, pump it, pamper, baby."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","464820","479420"," Uh, Winky, do you think, uh, maker, I'll get you a discord invite, Winky, do you think"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","479420","483300"," that the case, you think it's the case glass that's keep, that's shutting it down or you"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","483300","501580"," think it's the power supply?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","501580","504380"," Do I think that Baba trade is dead?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","504380","508300"," Uh, no, I think Baba's got a good chance of squeezing."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","508300","511100"," I think about Baba's market conditions."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","511100","514460"," I think it's generally just market conditions."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","514460","517380"," I think here we'll look at Baba real quick."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","517380","524220"," Let's see, we'll take a look at Baba."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","524220","550380"," Let me just say it, oh, I'll give you one minute here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","550380","559660"," It's a good question."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","559660","573940"," I saw those K web calls coming in too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","573940","586340"," I'll take a look at both of them, bring this up for Winky's, man."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","586340","596860"," So let's look at, uh, let's look at Baba, then you can see that, uh, firm demarcation"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","596860","603820"," right February 21 firm demarcation takes part, right, but then, but it doesn't take"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","603820","605340"," part in the second part."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","605340","606780"," I want to show you this right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","606780","618740"," I want you to see this right here, so right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","618740","625020"," So whenever the market is, uh, oversold, it participates in the first part of that trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","625020","629940"," but it doesn't participate in the second half of that, um, that roll over."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","629940","631420"," This is the rotation in the market."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","631420","636660"," I want you to see this if you're a trader out there, an investor, and we have an oversold"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","636660","643340"," condition in the market over here, okay, uh, October 5th, 2021."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","643340","649620"," And so Baba participates, right, and then the rotation trade, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","649620","652460"," So I'm going to talk about the rotation trade real quick."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","652460","656260"," And so you see this, we've done pretty quite well here, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","656260","657260"," Participated there."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","657260","659540"," We're starting to roll over now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","659540","661380"," Is that trade over?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","661380","665620"," The good thing that I want to tell you is that the market is rolling over and Baba looks"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","665620","668620"," like it has finished its corrective phase."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","668620","670380"," It looks like it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","670380","675500"," It's in line right now, uh, with the market, where the market's moving."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","675500","679700"," Um, so do I think the Baba trade is over?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","679700","681420"," Uh, no, not necessarily."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","681420","686140"," But what I do think is that it wrote that what I do think is that, uh, you wrote right"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","686140","693300"," now we were rotating in to Baba whenever the market breadth is low and that's rotated into"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","693300","701700"," and out of, um, so that would mean that, uh, you need to take profit every time, especially"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","701700","703860"," with it continuing to trade down, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","703860","705500"," We're still trading down here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","705500","711380"," Uh, so if I were to look at Baba here, I would think that the trade is over for, um,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","711380","718380"," let me get a second here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","718380","732980"," Yeah, I think, I, I, I, I'm looking at it right now and it's still, do I think you can go"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","732980","733980"," up today?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","733980","735460"," I think it's a rotational trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","735460","741060"," I think we're in the part of the rotation of the stock market, uh, where it's not"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","741060","742060"," participating."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","742060","748740"," I think it's participating in the, in the, every time we, we, you know, like the market"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","748740","754900"," goes up, we'd participate in the first part of that trade, because I participated in this"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","754900","755900"," part."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","755900","760460"," Um, it didn't really participate, did it, just started rolling over, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","760460","764740"," So it's still in that, that phase, uh, so the Baba trade is on every time the market"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","764740","772260"," capitulates till, uh, until it starts to, until it starts to, uh, I don't know, will"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","772260","778020"," it ever really, I don't know, maybe it'll, it'll snap back forever."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","778020","782460"," I see that how bullish it looks right now, uh, but so doesn't spy like bullish right"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","782460","791300"," now as well, but I think spy is still gonna roll at some point."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","791300","798020"," We are fucking cranking, aren't we?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","798020","799020"," Fuck yeah."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","799020","800020"," Do you guys butt?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","800020","801020"," Do you guys bet?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","801020","802020"," Do you guys buy that, buy that clothes yesterday?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","802020","808780"," Do you guys sell those puts yesterday at the clothes and buy some fucking calls?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","808780","814220"," No worries, wink."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","814220","820860"," So what it's doing is what it's happening is Baba is participating every time we hit"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","820860","827540"," a bottom, but it doesn't maintain does it?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","827540","829580"," It just starts to roll over."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","829580","832180"," So I guess you would say, bye Baba."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","832180","838740"," And then, and then during the rotation trade, you know, after the initial oversold trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","838740","848020"," once again, the rotation trade, you're going to switch to a news driven trade for Baba."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","848020","854100"," So if you are long here, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","854100","855980"," Take the money and run."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","855980","856980"," Talked about this."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","856980","857980"," Right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","857980","858980"," 446."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","858980","861500"," Take the money and run."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","861500","865580"," We'll come back here again."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","865580","871420"," Take the money and run."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","871420","879420"," We're going to look right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","879420","883900"," It's a little bit of seller stepping in right up here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","883900","884900"," 446."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","884900","886700"," 5.0 we talked about."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","886700","904460"," A little blue line that we showed, like a three hour trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","904460","916020"," If you wanted to do a Baba trade today, I would say wait for, let's say wait for confirmation"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","916020","919340"," down here in S1."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","919340","924140"," Wait for a bounce."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","924140","930220"," I mean, it could bounce here, but I'd be looking for like a bounce down here or a bounce down"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","930220","931220"," here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","931220","943140"," And maybe take that three hour trade here or here, but I see your point, Baba's not really"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","943140","946740"," participating at the moment, is it?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","946740","950660"," Yeah, it is."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","950660","953660"," It is by shit bounce right after 99.40."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","953660","957660"," It's now trading at 101.8."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","957660","965420"," It's a pretty fucking sweet bounce on Baba."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","965420","967580"," Three hour trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","967580","971060"," Why not?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","971060","973860"," I like the trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","973860","974860"," I mean, look at that."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","974860","980980"," One, two, how many days is it down?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","980980","987940"," Three, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","987940","990340"," It's fucking do, isn't it?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","990340","993980"," Nice consolidation in here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","993980","995700"," Little volume pump."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","995700","1001020"," Yeah, you can take the trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1002020","1007460"," And the fucking bull's are buying calls like mad man today."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1007460","1013940"," Bull's are balls deep in Nvidia too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1013940","1016420"," Don't close it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1016420","1017420"," Don't fucking close it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1017420","1020300"," Oh, you already got 60%."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1020300","1024660"," That's not a bad day, 60%."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1025660","1029940"," That's like a Bob real quick for you to close it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1029940","1033140"," And then we'll look at the queues."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1033140","1054620"," Yeah, so is any crushed here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1054620","1061620"," What is this?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1061620","1077900"," Why I don't have to do this every time I don't know why I don't want the fuck is going on"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1077900","1078900"," with it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1078900","1097460"," I can book map sometimes."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1097460","1101380"," Buyers are certainly in charge right now with this more sellers just at this moment"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1101380","1102380"," right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1103020","1104580"," But it does look like buyers are in charge."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1104580","1109420"," You can see it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1109420","1112940"," There are some put buyers stepping in currently."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1112940","1118420"," If it squeezes higher, you still got a shit ton of sellers."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1118420","1121740"," Look at that mountain of sellers."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1121740","1125700"," Take the money and run it fucking 10192."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1125700","1128500"," Take the money right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1128500","1133660"," If it beats this right here, if it gets above 101, 10206 or so, you can take that trade"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1133660","1134660"," again."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1134660","1149140"," I mean, you get a fucking mountain of sellers until 104, then 105, hold on."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1149140","1156420"," You could get a good squeeze off this trade right here too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1157060","1161380"," 104 and 105 is price target on it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1161380","1162380"," 104, 105."

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1833500","1842420"," AMD is where the first day trading stock ever day traded, or not day traded, oh fuck no I don't"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1842420","1854260"," like octa as a short, I like it as a long, AMD was like the first stock, the thing was the first stock ever"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1854260","1865820"," did a monthly zone, take one to three month calls, and they had like a printing machine,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1920580","1930580"," for this though for a trade, consolidation maybe, something like this, I don't know if I doubt that,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1931380","1944260"," maybe some capitulation and like this, possible, keep that on your radar, I think it just keeps"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1944260","1955700"," going up, but the book is saying something different, the book map saying real buyers are down here"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1955700","1963060"," waiting, keep an eye on the spy for a nice day trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1970420","1978820"," everybody works at octa, we're gonna look at JPM, let me take a look at JPM, yeah you guys have a,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1979060","1986660"," I saw some negative news on bank earnings, it's kind of funny,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1994580","1999220"," nice, nice bounce on JPM 131, 61 to 135, 58,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","1999860","2011860"," the bank trade, just get it, I haven't looked yet at the, I know that, I know we've got bank"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2012500","2019940"," ERs coming up, look up at the earnings calendar here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2033860","2039460"," so JPM is Wednesday before the open, do I have that right, just confirm that with me,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2042580","2052740"," so we got JPM, Delta, BlackRock, Bed Bath and Beyond, BBB, First Republic,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2054260","2057620"," in the morning then we've got WAFD,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2060580","2064100"," get Wells Fargo on Thursday and go to GS, Morgan Stanley,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2064100","2069700"," so let's look at a JPM and then we'll look at XLF,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2075140","2081540"," I like the idea, I don't like the idea of, like why bother, why bother with"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2082420","2087300"," JPM, like why, why line up all the banks and figure out which one fucked up or not,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2088260","2090100"," I think JPM's done, does done well,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2095140","2096100"," let me miss this trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2108100","2110020"," there's your buy the dip 128,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2110020","2116420"," here indicator is slightly positive, more buyers and sellers than JPM,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2123860","2129460"," but you can see the buyers are down below here, so if you're in it 127,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2130100","2137300"," it's take profit right here, right where you are,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2140580","2143060"," these sellers have disappeared, this is a good sign over here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2144820","2151940"," some have moved down, but the hidden seller is the ices above it, 146 or so,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2153300","2158340"," I never like holding bank stocks into their ERs because of course, unless you're holding"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2158340","2163140"," the actual physical underlying share because they tend to like rip,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2163140","2165860"," sometimes they rip into the next day, but I don't ever like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2167380","2170260"," I don't ever fucking like hold them so that your calls get fucked,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2170260","2174580"," two call spreads, two of them farther out in time if you want to do calls,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2176260","2177940"," otherwise take the fucking money and run,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2184100","2186100"," you probably get a sell off at some point today,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2186100","2188340"," two o'clock in the afternoon, three forty-five in the afternoon,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2191380","2196260"," it's a tough trade, I don't ever like like whenever earnings season comes,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2196260","2202500"," I'd rather fucking trade like XLF and get three out of the four right and not get fucked on one,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2202500","2223300"," I mean, look at those sellers, they're just lining up,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2232500","2243220"," I'd have to look at the book on this one too,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2253540","2256260"," I'm assuming you get the 40 if all of them do well,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2256420","2268420"," it sucks too because interest rates actually hurt the fees on banks,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2271860","2274900"," believe it or not, banks like lower rates when it comes to mortgages,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2277380","2283860"," they make less than fees, we're up to almost 5% right now in mortgages, it's a tough call"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2283860","2289940"," in this ER, I'd say take the money and fucking run,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2297460","2299780"," still down here waiting for my price target,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2299780","2314580"," yeah, I think the trade and financials is over, I mean, it's not that you can't fucking beat it,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2813460","2821380"," traded higher, right, I'd be bullish here, I'm not saying it's going to trade lower,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2905300","2908580"," nice sweet dip buy down here, I don't think you could get down to 50 bucks,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2911460","2918260"," maybe on bad guidance, possibly, but I doubt it, I think this is fair value,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2919780","2924420"," like 70, so you could take this trade, but in reality, you're just looking for that dip,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2924500","2929620"," looking for that one, if you can buy, it was me buying every dip at 70 bucks all day long,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2931940","2932660"," so it's risky,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2981940","2985860"," and you can see right here 74 that this is just standing fucking limit orders"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2992900","2996820"," yeah, 71 bucks, 70 dude, all day long,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","2999140","3001780"," so it's dangerous, I'm not saying you can't take this short, I'm just saying,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3015940","3019380"," 75, 76, we're talking about that one, that's a serious level two,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3031780","3035220"," at that point, that's a tough one dude, you see the accumulation going on down here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3035220","3036820"," is big, and it makes sense,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3039060","3042980"," I would say that it's ending its corrective phase at some point, even if the news is shitty out there,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3047460","3049620"," you can take it, it might still go down,"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3865740","3875260"," to unfuck them from that trade, might be because really large tail risk event, like, you know,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3875260","3880220"," like, we had like 360 today or tomorrow or something, the risk of that tail risk happening"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3880220","3886460"," has gone down, and I didn't see anybody talking about it anywhere, and then I first came out"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3886460","3891300"," somewhere else, I didn't see any comments in the comments section, nobody commenting"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3891300","3895940"," on it, and I just thought it was neat because you don't really hear too often a comment like"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3895940","3901180"," hey there, you know, like one bank helping another one out behind the scenes, hush, hush,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3901180","3922860"," unusual exchange, exchanging their holdings direct to the ETN, back end open range, yes,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3922860","3931900"," yes, yeah, he's a great dude, I like him a lot, but I want to pry him on it, I want to like poke"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3931900","3945100"," at him and be like, hey man, why is there this selling right here, well, we had longs here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3945100","3953420"," sellers stepped in here, we talked about retesting this morning before open range on stream, we said"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3953420","3964500"," expect a retest, we got it, so we took profit here, and then we've been waiting for it to come back"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3964500","3972460"," down, as a matter of fact this blue line, we started this line at 1016, it's now 1045, and we said it"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3972460","3979020"," should come back down here, right, we've got another two levels that we've got written in here, we"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3979020","3985420"," wrote, we talked about this one here, we talked about this one here, we talked one down here like"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3985420","3992660"," 441 or something, but I think it's moved down to 440, this is your ABC kind of a trade, right, you're"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","3992660","4001500"," looking to buy this here, buy this here, or buy this down here, to go long, and then this is your"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4001580","4008540"," cut your losses, kind of an area down here too, so you'd buy this for a long, if it breaks through"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4008540","4019260"," here, you get rid of your longs here, so we've just been waiting for the trade, so now we're looking"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4019260","4024540"," here, here indicator, call buyers are stepping in, we can already see that, call buyers are starting"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4024540","4032460"," to step in, we can see the curve down below here, the call buyers are making their first entries,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4037500","4040460"," we can see there's still lots of sellers above,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4042540","4047900"," here's trying to get good positioning, we talked about that, I think before the start too, which"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4047900","4053260"," would be, that's a nice little number, see that little band down below here at 441,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4060700","4062460"," I'll try to see if there's still down here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4066460","4071340"," yep, so this is kind of the, this is where your sell, cut your losses if you're a bull,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4072060","4074140"," down here and this is where your dip buying area is,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4074140","4081020"," not seeing any rug pulling yet, still more sellers above,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4086620","4092140"," so I was waiting to take a trade, I think we talked earlier this morning too, I think we talked about"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4094540","4100460"," if you're a bear, right, I think we even talked about this right, I think we said if you're a bear,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4101180","4104860"," you want to, I think we talked about even Twitter yesterday, right, we said"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4106460","4110940"," you want to be able to take your first short here and your second short there, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4111900","4117820"," better positioning for a short position in these two locations, so you already had one here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4119820","4124300"," it was the same chart that I've been using with you for the past two weeks, you can see we almost"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4124300","4132300"," tagged it right to the tee, right here, and we talked before the morning too, where you,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4132300","4137660"," I would expect to see a bounce down here and that trade to 450 above here, somewhere in here for"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4137660","4144140"," the second short, so this is your first short and your second short here, I don't know if we get"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4144140","4149180"," down here to ask one because there's a lot of traffic down in here, so I did say that this this"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4149260","4157740"," morning, but I am concerned because if we do break this level here, looks like it's a clear skies"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4157740","4167980"," below, so we'll keep an eye on it, and I'll show you that clear skies below right now, so"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4168860","4182620"," 441, you see if it breaks, this is a little band down here at 439, right there, 439,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4185100","4192460"," but that's some nice running down here, right, 439 to 433 is some fucking meat, so let's talk"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4192460","4197340"," about this right here, okay, let's talk about this, we're going to talk about this and how to take"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4197420","4201740"," this short properly, some of you just joined me the first time, so we'll uh,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4203420","4209580"," let's see, you guys are old followers, long time followers, some of you are newish, okay, so"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4210140","4213820"," if you're a bear and you're like, I want to take the super, super bearish here, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4214780","4219100"," we know about this first rejection here, we knew about this before we even opened the day,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4219740","4224380"," matter of fact, we talked about revisiting this, right, we already know about our charting,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4224460","4229500"," our candlestick charting, we know what the book map is telling us, so if you're bearish here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4230700","4232220"," and you took this down here, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4235020","4239260"," let's see, you want to hold this and say, fuck you Cap, we're selling it, so you're going to"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4239980","4248220"," take your money and run here, right, even if it breaks through, okay, so what's going to happen"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4248220","4256300"," is it's going to snap back up and retest this 440, where the juice is, is this next move down"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4256300","4269980"," to that 433, so you want to be taking, uh, you want to take this leg, right, then you want to let"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4269980","4275580"," off, and you're going to wait for this to come back up, right, and then wait for it to reject"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4275580","4280860"," below 439, and pick it back up here, that's where you're going to pick it up that second short,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4282220","4286940"," and the reason being is because if it does bounce here, you'll get fucked, right, you'll get all"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4286940","4291900"," your money you'll lose, so this is the first one right here, I personally would take it here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4291900","4295980"," I would take my money and run here, I wouldn't take it all the way down to this here, you just,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4295980","4301100"," you just need this part here, and then you need this part right here, that's the safe trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4301100","4304620"," now it doesn't mean it won't work for you one time to get all this, and then to get all this,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4304620","4309180"," but this is the danger area in here, it's like no man's landing here, you won't fuck around in here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4312380","4318620"," that's if you bearish, because if you catch this bounce here, you're, you're fucked, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4318620","4322460"," if you stay in the trade, this is, this plenty of money right here, it's good money,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4324300","4327260"," just like this was good money, that was a good trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4329980","4331900"," so I'll see if this holds, if it doesn't hold,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4332780","4338780"," now my overall, my overall position is still bearish,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4340780","4345660"," I don't know if it happens today, I think it happens tomorrow, it never happens that cleanly,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4345660","4351260"," maybe it will, it's been happening pretty fucking clean for like, I don't fucking know,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4352380","4357660"," since the 29th, we're getting there right, this one I missed a little bit,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4358620","4362620"," but this one up here is pretty fucking close, to where I want to see it go,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4365580","4372220"," my price target's somewhere down in here, this is a JPM caller is somewhere down in here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4372220","4375900"," and once we get down here, if you want to see if we'll trade below this,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4376780","4380860"," we'll look at the, we'll look at the breadth indicator, if the breadth is still in there,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4380860","4386060"," we can go lower, if the breadth is bottom the fuck out, if you're the capitulation move down,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4386700","4390700"," the price doesn't matter, it's the breadth, and if the breadth hasn't bottomed out,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4390700","4396780"," we can start trading lower, we can go down to, you know, 420, and 410, and 400,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4397660","4402700"," well it depends, I'll look at the ES chart to see, but somewhere down there,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4404620","4408540"," there's that like first test somewhere, it's not, this is not accurate, because I got to do this on,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4408540","4412460"," I got to do this on, on ES, so you can see the full scale,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4413420","4419260"," it's your first test down there, like 420, but then there's a bigger one that goes down to like 400,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4419260","4423420"," it gets lower every day, it was like four, four or nine, either day, it gets a 405 now,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4425740","4426700"," it's on a different chart,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4429340","4433580"," you can see the bounce happening right now, small little bounce right here, we'll see if this"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4433580","4440860"," holds up, or if it rejects, we'll head down now to 440, if it rejects,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4442860","4460060"," just below v-wop, this is the end of the bulls down here, where my cursor is right here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4460860","4468300"," as the goat would say, follow my cursor, right down here, 441-75, the virus is stepping in,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4468380","4472940"," if they pull a rug, you got hair indicator still turning green, so we'll see if the bulls can hold"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4472940","4477420"," on to it, and if they can't, it'll be done, it'll sell down to the next level."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4485580","4493820"," Oh no, yeah, I sold my longs at, I sold my longs right here, right up in here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4493820","4503340"," and now what am I looking for here, I didn't take this short here, but I'm looking for,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4504300","4512540"," because of the CPI report, I'm looking for a dip buy here, or possibly down in here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4512540","4521020"," if I can get that dip buy, I'd like to see the retest of, this is the cash gap fill,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4521020","4527740"," this is the cash gap fill in the previous day at 440, so I'm looking at it right now, and I'm like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4527740","4534860"," ooh, we can get that 440 bounce, this is profit taken, I'm not seeing any major selling right now,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4541260","4545420"," I think there's a bigger short at like 450, I could be wrong on that too, but I think there is,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4545420","4551500"," oh no shit, Brian is back on YouTube, fuck yeah,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4564380","4574220"," yeah, the valuation, it's like, it's basically like, it's basically like, how bank trades"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4576380","4589420"," Shopify, right, it just, or Amazon, but it's for like, it's for poor people to trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4595420","4596780"," I'll look at PFE for you,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4596780","4598780"," okay,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4605100","4611660"," good dip bar stepping in on apple spy right now, Nvidia another dip buying session,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4614780","4618620"," so a dip bar is definitely showing up, I'm not seeing waves of puts coming in right now,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4618620","4624620"," let's take a look at the put call ratio as well,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4626860","4635100"," bullet sediment 83%, bearish seven, yeah, but it's bullish 83%, put to call it's .42,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4636300","4643500"," so 130,000 calls to 55,000 puts, not overly bearish here at this moment,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4644460","4650300"," or at least, you know, it's not, it's not, we're not down to fucking 60% and, you know, 200,000"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4650300","4657820"," puts being bought, get some puts being bought on IWM, Tesla lot, 6.5 million in Tesla calls,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4658860","4666460"," Nvidia though, number two with 14, 16 orders of calls, then apple with 13 orders,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4666700","4672220"," some other standouts right now, if there were some, would be CS,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4674540","4678220"," $200,000 in calls for September 16th, 8c,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4681820","4686780"," now those started coming in at 10.30, just heads up on that, we'll look at CS real quick,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4689020","4695580"," a rasher of calls coming in on a CS, credit Swiss, they had some other shit, they had some"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4695580","4701740"," funky shit come out too, didn't they, or douchebag, douchebag bank, so look at CS,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4704380","4714220"," ATER had calls just come out, April 14th, 5c, ATER, we're looking to see what's going on with them,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4714220","4717500"," so it's like insider trading, I know something we don't know,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4718060","4724620"," so we'll have ATER next, 6 trades on that one,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4729740","4735740"," same usual dip buyers on Tesla, Nvidia of course, Nvidia is returning into fucking"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4737180","4743260"," Tesla in some ways, right, there's a close companion to it, or even AMD, like trader favorites,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4744220","4746300"," like Nvidia just don't give a fuck,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4752380","4756380"," so look at ATER and CS, see what's going on here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4760220","4762140"," huge buyers on CS,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4767660","4769020"," it's like they're looking for a squeeze,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4774060","4778220"," why is that,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4783740","4793820"," 810 real sellers up, 87920, 920, price target, maybe,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4793820","4804300"," I quote it credit Swiss,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4804940","4810220"," following me leasing their monthly sales orders, total net orders, decline to 76 in March from"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4810220","4815580"," 170, yeah I mean they look like they're ready in February, they booked 53 orders against 15"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4816060","4816780"," it's not a bad trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4819820","4821660"," I like the accumulation here on CS,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4823340","4827420"," there's a correlation down here, buyers down there,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4828380","4832460"," had a bounce down below here at 647, it's not at 763,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4832460","4836620"," 1, 2, you can chart this out for yourself,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4839100","4842220"," but some trades on CS I think for September,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4845580","4850300"," oh that's juicy right there,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4851740","4855420"," talking about a fucking squeeze play, look at that, see that volume down there, that ripper,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4856300","4859580"," look at ATER, ATER,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4865260","4872540"," squeeze baby, look at that squeeze, oh yeah, look at Jesus Christ, 40,000 buyers,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4873180","4879340"," fucking sellers, the fucking sellers here, this must be a squeeze play in progress,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4882460","4887180"," that's a squeeze play, where is it squeeze to,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4892380","4900380"," the fuck is going on here, 10 bucks, Jesus, 10 dollars,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4903420","4908700"," if it can get higher than 6, 582, 665,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4912540","4916940"," lots of buyers on ATER, unusual, call flow, very unusual,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4927420","4932060"," just localized, look at it, I like this, I can't say I don't,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4932620","4942700"," someone wants it, right, someone wants it, careful up here at 5 bucks of course,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4947420","4948060"," but I like it,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4954780","4956140"," it's getting lots of call action,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4962540","4972780"," bring the spy back over here, talking about this one earlier, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4973500","4976300"," one, two, three, boom,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4979580","4985420"," we'll have a squeeze play going on here on the spy, could trade that for a five-minute trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","4993180","5005980"," apparently Octa CEO is selling stock to reverse employees for their stock losses,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5005980","5010620"," what my buddy who works there said, I can confirm, sorry I apologize for that,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5012140","5018540"," I think I said I would do PFE and I didn't, I got sidetracked man, I'm not a tangent,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5019180","5023180"," let it, we'll let PFE load up,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5023180","5027820"," I don't know if that's what I'm saying,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5047980","5052700"," just off the top on PFE, I like the trade, I just think you got one, two, three,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5053260","5059420"," four, I guess I guess you could call that five if you wanted to, but if you were going to raise"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5059420","5068220"," this up and take that trade, you wanted to have bought it here, I'll be waiting for 53-51,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5068220","5075180"," my one concern here is that you have a higher low, right here, you can see that right, higher low,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5075340","5081660"," if I had to guess this is a distribution,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5090220","5093740"," yep, what does that mean though,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5093740","5114540"," I'm not bullish on, not bullish on PFE,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5114540","5125820"," I'd be willing to buy it down here in this area here, but I'd like to see that consolidation,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5127180","5135660"," maybe that one trade down then higher, what I don't want to see is something like this,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5136540","5142940"," that comes down and starts to trade down like this, does that make sense,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5145180","5146940"," so I don't want to see a rejection in here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5149820","5155740"," you could buy any of these dips, but you have to cut your losses down here, if you see a break"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5155740","5164860"," of 50-48, that's no bueno, I don't like this being lower, I don't like that being lower, I kind of"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5165580","5171740"," you want to see that extension, that's really what you want to see,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5174940","5181100"," right now it's showing, it's either showing a zone of consolidation or it's rolling over for a"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5181100","5188380"," corrective move, so we will look at PFE on"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5188380","5200220"," some nice bounce here, it looks well right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5205100","5210700"," okay, slightly more sellers than buyers, intraday, you're probably starting to have 60 bucks and then"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5210700","5214220"," sell it, let the banks do the work for you to get it higher,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5214620","5223980"," it looks, it looks, it looks, this looks corrective, so you can say it's 10-thick money and run,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5223980","5229820"," but I could be wrong on that, I would say sell the rips, sell the rips on 60,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5233740","5238700"," it is even slightly higher right, so what is that showing you, it's showing you that"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5239260","5245740"," until you wear out the sellers, so what it's showing you is this, the book map is showing you that,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5246380","5255660"," that there are a bunch of trap buyers up here, okay, trap buyers, what they're showing you is that"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5255660","5261660"," we came back down and we came back up and these buyers said, these buyers that were stuck up here"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5262540","5269980"," said, I just want to get out of my fucking trade, I'm sick of being stuck in here, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5269980","5275740"," the first chance I get, I'm going to sell, so sellers are coming in and the sellers are now"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5275740","5283020"," coming down, right, now they're up here at 60, but they're doing this, they're hiding up here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5283020","5286860"," telling you I ain't put selling, but the moment they become up here, you can see that they're"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5286940","5294140"," selling, so until you wear out these trap buyers, which leads to sideways, right,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5294140","5301500"," wear them out, let me move up again, but that's a pretty big fucking wall, they're at like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5301500","5310140"," or they're at like here and here, if the longer time passes, the more it leads to downward capitulation"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5310140","5330860"," moves. This chart, in this timeframe, I'm going to say celery fucking rip on PFE, I'm bearish."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5331580","5341660"," Good to see you, Vishal. So not yet, I haven't done anything yet, I've been trying to do tickers"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5341660","5348540"," for people that are requesting tickers, so I haven't done anything yet. I bought, let's come back here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5348540","5363340"," what did I buy? I bought, I bought calls here, right here, and then I sold calls up here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5370140","5375260"," Now, I said, I'm looking to buy some calls somewhere down in here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5375980","5382380"," either here, I think I said somewhere down in here, but I'd really like to be honest with you,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5382380","5388140"," right where we are right now, I'd like to buy them right down in here. So I haven't done nothing,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5388140","5399500"," I'm just sitting here fucking around, fucking around waiting for, I'm waiting for a,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5405660","5411580"," let's see, let's take a look at the book map and see if it's ready."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5418140","5426700"," A little bit of rug pulling going on, right down here, 441, 442 buyers, bearish stepping in,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5426700","5432460"," hearing the caters turning up. Not there yet, I'm close."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5435260","5441020"," A little bit of 413, 440p."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5458380","5463100"," Good job, Crazy Eddie. Good to see you, Michelle, one more time."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5463980","5469180"," Okay, A-Rod wants me to check FCX, and then DAO,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5473660","5479260"," FCX, we'll load that up, and then DAO,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5482140","5489020"," and then what's the other one you guys wanted me to do, zone, still liking that oil trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5489900","5491580"," I can't blame you for liking the oil trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5494060","5496540"," I can't blame you, I get the oil trade,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5500380","5505180"," and it looks like fucking distribution to me, it doesn't look like it really does."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5505580","5515900"," Let's see, zone, DAL, and then FCX."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5519900","5524860"," All right, yeah, FCX looks bullish."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5525660","5533900"," DAL somewhat, looks somewhat bullish."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5538060","5545100"," Yeah, yeah, I like that trade, I like that DAL trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5545740","5556860"," The oil trade, I think, you know, it's not that it's not on, it's that it's,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5556860","5559820"," and I like their earnings too, potential."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5562220","5568220"," Yeah, XOM looks like it's gonna go up, it's gonna squeeze, it's a sending triangle,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5569420","5573180"," or it's not a saying triangle, it's called a, I forget it's called, but it's very bullish,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5573180","5574220"," it's a context."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5577580","5580140"," Don't like DAL here too, and I like FCX here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5581420","5583180"," Guys, they're all throwing great tickers today."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5589500","5593180"," But man, if this market just turns, flips a bitch."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5593180","5598860"," Of all three of them, I like XOM better, if it's, if I had to choose between FCX, DAL,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5598860","5601100"," and XOM, XOM would be my pick."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5604060","5611420"," The only reason is if market conditions flip, FCX and DAL are gonna burn."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5614540","5623660"," We'll look at them on, more buyers and sellers, more put buyers."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5633180","5639980"," I can't see much in FCX."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5647260","5650060"," First target, 54, 55."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5654700","5655980"," And then a squeeze, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5657020","5657660"," That's not bad."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5660060","5662780"," It's actually good, that's a good target, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5663180","5669260"," It's actually a pretty good target."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5681500","5682700"," Let's target right there."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5687900","5691020"," I like how it's come up, I like, I like, I can't say I don't like FCX."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5691980","5694860"," I always feel like though, I always feel like it comes up, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5694860","5701260"," And then it's that one capitulation move that, and it finds that, finds those buyers down lower."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5702380","5703340"," It's not done yet."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5705500","5706780"," I think it's got one more leg."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5708060","5710700"," And then you get up there and do that, a nice big push."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5710700","5714220"," But that could work, this might be the one."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5714220","5723420"," But price target is 55 on FCX."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5733500","5736220"," DAL, I love this rotation trade still on."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5739580","5740940"," Kind of the same thing here, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5740940","5743980"," I don't think Mayor of Muriapul saying as late as I knew him."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5743980","5745500"," Slightly more sellers than buyers."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5745500","5747740"," You can, I'm a little bit less bullish on her."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5747740","5750300"," You know, people have been killed since the start of our DAL right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5750300","5751500"," I like the opening trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5751500","5753180"," I like gas prices going down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5753180","5755980"," I like the story, the reopened trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5759900","5761660"," $50 price target on DAL."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5766540","5768140"," Which makes sense, I'm not going to go any higher."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5768780","5772940"," I would expect the trade to 50 bucks, and then it's going to have to fight to get up there again."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5774700","5777020"," And then you're going to get some trouble to 55."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5777020","5778300"," Clear skies to 60."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5783180","5786220"," Still a huge fucking move for DAL."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5786220","5791660"," Maybe you're right, I said that I was at least bullish on DAL, but I mean seriously."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5792460","5795100"," We said 50 fucking dollars, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5795100","5797020"," And that's fucking high as fuck."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5800380","5801340"," We said 50."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5806940","5808380"," Price target 50 bucks."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5809740","5810220"," That's good."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5811740","5813420"," Shit tons of consolidation too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5815420","5816300"," I like that trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5817260","5819500"," All right, so more bullish on DAL again."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5821740","5824140"," Damn, you guys are giving me some bitchin' trades."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5826140","5827260"," Bitchin' trades."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5827260","5829180"," You guys used to give me such shit trades."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5830380","5831020"," Hold on here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5831660","5832380"," I hurt my back."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5834060","5835180"," I've been working hard."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5838700","5839500"," XLM."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5841100","5842060"," Sellers at 90."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5846300","5850700"," See, this still looks like distribution of me, man."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5850700","5853020"," This is totally fucking, this is totally distribution."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5854940","5856620"," Y'all need to crack some fucking books."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5865260","5867100"," Looks like fucking boldface lies."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5868460","5869660"," Tell you what it looks like, okay?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5870940","5873580"," Looks like fucking CNBC is telling you to buy oil."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5874540","5877580"," And all those fucks are hiding up here just waiting to fucking,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5877580","5879980"," just fucking, selling to your ass."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5881580","5882380"," That's what it looks like."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5883820","5886380"," This looks the most bullish on just a candlestick chart."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5887260","5888700"," But I'll fucking tell you what."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5890780","5891740"," I think they're lying."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5893100","5897340"," I think they're fucking, I think they're selling into you right now is what I think."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5898540","5900940"," Let's say that this morning, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5903020","5909820"," We'll talk about, we'll talk about, I'll get some, let's see if I can bring that up right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5910700","5911340"," Okay."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5922620","5923020"," Okay."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5923020","5944860"," Do like a, on your own time, do like a Google search and just look up oil price shocks and"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5944860","5953220"," real GDP growth testing for non linearity, just do some, do some reading on it. You"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5953220","5961260"," can probably find like a, I'm sure there's a white paper out here you can find. It's"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5961260","5967760"," a perfect one right here. So 2004, but it doesn't matter. But read some of this stuff"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5967760","5972740"," like dig down deep into this stuff so that you can understand the relationship between"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5972740","5978540"," this stuff that I was talking about this morning when I was going on a fucking rant"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5978540","5987900"," on Twitter. And the relationship. And then keep your eyes out for, because normally I"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5987900","5999980"," would say GDP should be going up. But we're in an abnormal time. This is not normal for"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","5999980","6009660"," what happened was kind of artificial, right? So I don't know if oil is going to, and that's"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6009660","6013260"," the thing if you, this is the trade, this, and this is the beginning of the idea behind"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6013260","6020220"," the trade on this, okay? If you look, if you start to compare like, USO or what is the"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6020220","6028220"," other one, BNO, or whatever, if we're going to, if we're going to hold on, let me bring"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6028220","6036100"," something up. So I think the, what they're trying to sell to you right now is, then I"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6036740","6050700"," didn't articulate this well earlier this morning. Try to keep things simple here. Let me show"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6050700","6056180"," you this by here. And you can research this on your own. I've already done the research,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6056180","6064100"," but I'm going to give you a simplified version. If we're going to go into a recession, under"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6064100","6074500"," normal circumstances, you would see, it's weird, you're like, so comparatively, let me,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6074500","6085260"," let me get rid of this, this isn't a good comparison yet. So comparatively, right here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6085260","6095820"," comparatively speaking, basically oil like shit the bed, right? During COVID, and it never"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6095820","6105820"," came back. And it's come back now, right? In force that's come back. Well, with the oil"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6105820","6113820"," people are going to tell you is that, with the old people are going to tell you is that,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6115020","6124220"," here, let me see if I can, let me see. So, you know, oil fucking shit the bed. And it never really"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6124220","6128460"," came back. And then of course, it needs to come back in line, which it's, which it's done now,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6128460","6133580"," basically, actually, you remember that, make it even, I'll give it even better. Please surpass"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6135740","6139900"," for, for some time, six, three months, six months, whatever, fucking straight shot to the moon,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6141980","6150620"," while while the S&P 500 continued to sell off for the rest of the year, the only issue I have with"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6150620","6160300"," this. Posit is that real GDP is, is being forecast is coming down. It's not going to continue up,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6160300","6168300"," even though the S&P 500 is going down. So this trade right here, I don't know, like, I got the,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6168300","6172780"," I got this, because it is different. Where we are right now is different. You can't deny that it"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6172780","6178940"," isn't, we haven't had fucking COVID in the 70s, we didn't have fucking COVID, any other fucking time."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6178940","6184300"," So I have a hard time with that trade right now. I have a hard time with,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6186060","6191100"," I have a hard time with them telling you to buy. I feel like when, I feel like if that was the"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6191100","6194540"," fucking trade, they wouldn't tell you, because I remember the oil and gas trade, there was only a"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6194540","6200220"," few people talking about it on Twitter. When it wasn't a trade, a few, few, like oil and gas"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6200220","6205580"," traders are like trade this trade fucking oil and gas, but it wasn't fucking CNBC telling you."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6206060","6212860"," And so I feel like, and then, and then GDP, I would take that trade again,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6214860","6221820"," if we beat GDP expectations, real GDP expectations, which have been, which have been downgraded."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6221820","6227980"," Got a nice little bind coming in here, down below here in the spy. But I just think right now, I'm like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6229980","6234540"," I'm like, if they, I guarantee if they revise GDP expectations, you'll see fucking, I'll go to"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6234620","6239180"," the fucking moon, like straight fucking moon north and you'll see fucking spy roll over,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6239180","6242060"," but we're not seeing that right now. It's not matching up."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6245820","6248300"," Some scratching, scratching my head on that trade still."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6251420","6260060"," I ain't buying it. Nice little consolidation down here, boom, trade higher."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6260780","6265660"," There is something to be said here for the energy market."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6265660","6270380"," See that for the last few minutes, that Russian oil and gas condensate production."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6270380","6272860"," There's something to be said for where we are right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6272860","6277340"," Week to 10.3.2, but a triple top, right."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6277980","6279660"," Bellsbury on average in March."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6280700","6283500"," Or two, we all still bought a new double top."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6284460","6285820"," Consolidation."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6290940","6292860"," We'll look for where the sellers are above here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6292860","6295900"," I'm going to assuming this is where the pain is for bears. So,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6301820","6303580"," I'm going to say we're going to 450 here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6307020","6308780"," Let's see the bears are going to fucking feel some pain."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6313500","6325660"," That's what I think."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6331900","6333660"," CNBC always tells you by the top."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6333660","6344380"," B.A. Colorado's."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6348860","6350300"," I don't disagree."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6357340","6360220"," I've got both of them. I've got both market wizards books."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6360220","6363820"," I've got them sitting on the shelf behind me."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6364620","6367260"," Read them both. They're both good. The new market wizards."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6367260","6368620"," The original one is badass."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6371260","6373260"," The original one is fucking super badass."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6383100","6387900"," Just to note that right here, 444.45 is going to be the first place of resistance."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6387980","6393500"," If we break through 444.45, price target above is 450."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6394700","6398380"," 449.52. I think we get through that. I think we get to 450."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6398940","6403100"," Didn't I fucking talk to you motherfuckers on Twitter yesterday and tell you to look back at December?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6407660","6409900"," We'll be here fucking cursing and swearing at you."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6409900","6413580"," Let's bring up fucking December. I'm going to tell you why. December 10th, they think I posted."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6415020","6417020"," I'm going to bring it back. I'm going to bring up to December."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6418780","6420540"," I'm going to prime an example."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6421980","6424540"," I'm not saying it's going to be guaranteed this is going to happen, but"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6426540","6427500"," so far it's happened."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6430380","6432140"," I guess eventually I'll be wrong, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6439660","6441820"," All right, so let's look at December 10th."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6441820","6447500"," Here's December 10th. Here, right here is good."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6451180","6455180"," It's not exact, but it's a good thing to look at."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6456860","6459180"," We got scared at a CPI numbers coming out in December."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6462700","6466940"," This doesn't do a good job. This is spy. It's not showing you what actually happened in the overnight."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6467900","6473100"," But you can see right here, we sold down on anticipation. This is telling down"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6473100","6479660"," anticipation of bad CPI numbers. I think it was much deeper too. You can actually see it down here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6479660","6480940"," It was much deeper in the overnight."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6481900","6486460"," Let me kind of came back up in the morning. It makes sense. A little bit of weakness down here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6487020","6490620"," And we got bad numbers, but we already knew it was bad numbers. We had been consolidating"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6490620","6494860"," for a few days. Boom, we sold up. Boom, we sold down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6496460","6500780"," And what's interesting about this is that the numbers are bad. They were just what we have right"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6500780","6510060"," now. Pretty much in line. But what happened was, look at that fucking trade up here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6511260","6517740"," And that's that like one and that two, right? One, two for better positioning because people got"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6517740","6522460"," paid down here. Remember that, right? The reason to bring that up is because,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6524860","6534700"," damn it, is because we still traded down here. But I know if you were holding short"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6534700","6541340"," hay, it'd be fucking getting fucked, right? I knew if you were short here, you got fucked 100%."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6542060","6545740"," I knew if you're like, oh, I'm really super bearish down here. And then, oh, I'm super bearish down"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6545820","6550620"," here. And both times you got wrecked. And then it was that third time where it went, bam,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6551820","6557180"," right? That bad CPI took a day. And it wasn't really bad. It was bad."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6557180","6563420"," See if you have it was also heading into end of month. You can see it right here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6566060","6572620"," Boom, right? Shorts release. Take their money and run. Boom, right? Shorts release. Take their"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6572620","6581580"," money and run. And so when you're looking at today, in the past five days or whatever, past month,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6583900","6590700"," it does make sense. I know we're supposed to stay in this, but we broke low here. So it wouldn't"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6590700","6596860"," surprise me to see a squeeze higher that just like we did that night, that squeeze higher, and then"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6596940","6606300"," boom, you get that, you get that downward move. So if you're on some calls right now, what does"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6606300","6620460"," that mean for you? It means as we come into this 445 means that you take your profit right there,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6621340","6628860"," you wait for it to consolidate and hold, right? And then bam, you took that versus higher."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6628860","6632540"," Because it's ready for the day of the foot to down four tenths, one percent, the countdown,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6632540","6636300"," three tenths. All this shit here in the German DAX down half a percent. Because you already know"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6636300","6643420"," the next move up is 450. The moment that you fucking squeeze these bears out here is what this"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6643420","6658540"," where the money is. Remember 445, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6667260","6671980"," See those sellers right there? The moment you get above this,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6671980","6678140"," this like 446.50, this volatility zone, shit is on."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6687900","6693820"," Bring that shit up, Jamie. What am I supposed to say? What did I miss?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6702940","6715100"," The call's rolling right now in the spy, AMD, Apple, SPX calls, April 13th, 4500c,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6715100","6723180"," $376,000. If any of you aren't discord, I've got the options flow up in there. I think you guys"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6723180","6727020"," can hear me in there too. You can mute me as well."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6727900","6737580"," I'm going to take a quick break. I'm staying out taking a lunch. I've missed now two trades."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6738860","6742620"," Because I'm talking to everybody. I missed everybody."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6749180","6756620"," There you go up here. Right up here as those sellers are 445. They swoop down sometimes"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6756620","6761500"," to remember that. You might not get exactly a 44.50. You'll see they'll see them swoop in,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6761500","6767740"," but right now the bulls are in charge. You see the hair and the care heading up nice and high"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6767740","6776460"," right here. Real buyers stepping in. I'll also remember that if you let the banks do the work"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6776460","6781260"," for you, if there are some call holders here, they're just waiting to get out so they're hiding"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6781260","6785580"," up here, just trying to take their money and run. People that bought down here just want to get"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6785580","6791980"," their money. So just be conscious of that. And as you come to this zone here, wait to buy it,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6791980","6799500"," to go higher. You take the leg and take the next leg. Price target for right now 450. I'm still"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6799500","6812380"," sticking with that right now. I'm going to stick with 450. If not today tomorrow, unless some changes."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6813340","6816940"," Not overly bullish, but lots of buyers in the market. Lots of call buyers in the market. Not"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6816940","6824700"," seeing tons of puts coming in. I'm looking for dates on this stuff."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6828780","6839340"," All expires tomorrow. Seems reasonable. So we go up. Seems reasonable."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6843340","6855100"," Yeah, almost time for a sandwich and a whiskey. Yeah, I got a my daughter just asked me if I wanted"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6859340","6866940"," something to drink. I don't want any lunch or anything. I have water over here, but I want to"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6867020","6881340"," get a cup of coffee or something. You know, I started taking I needed like motivation energy."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6881340","6887660"," I started taking something called DHEA. Have you guys ever taken that supplement?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6889420","6894060"," This shit's like Adderall. It doesn't get you all fucked up like Adderall,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6894060","6902300"," but DHEA. Check that shit out. It's like a testosterone precursor or something. Take that in the"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6902300","6916140"," morning. You ain't going back to sleep. Have you taken that DH? It's Delta Echo DH."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6916140","6928460"," I know Delta Hotel Echo Alpha DH EA. Oh, you've taken it Jade Pastor? That's just pretty good."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6930620","6936140"," Oh, yeah, it's like a precursor to testosterone. It doesn't get you all amped up like caffeine pills."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6936700","6943980"," There's no hangover from it. I started taking that like a I think a week ago. Two weeks ago,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6944780","6952140"," but it keeps me fucking motivated all day long. Yeah, Neutropics. That's a Neutropic."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6958220","6959020"," No kidding, huh?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6962860","6967740"," Yeah, it's over the counter. It's by prescription in other countries. Like you can't get it unless"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6967820","6972700"," you get it. It's like it's definitely it's like a loophole a loophole drug in the US."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6974700","6979740"," But it's it's awesome. And it's almost like you get you notice right away."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6981740","6992140"," Yeah, DHEA. Love it. Motivated. Yeah, it's not like a caffeine pill. Yeah, I take the 100s."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6993020","6998300"," I'm taking but you know, it's weird. I've been like some people are saying I should only be taking 25s."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","6999180","7007180"," But the capsules I have, I can't break them up easily. So I'm only taking them like the first few days."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7007180","7011420"," I took them like every day and I'm like, that's too much. So now it's like every few days. I'll pop"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7011420","7017020"," one two, three days. We have depending on how I'm feeling. I'll pop one. And they're not like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7017020","7025260"," you know, like the old school like stackers and I've taken Adderall when I was in college."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7026940","7031580"," So it's not known that hangover from it. There's no like, I can sleep just fine. I take it in the"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7031580","7039820"," morning. But there's no like jagged edge from it. There's no hangover from it. I've heard you can't,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7039820","7043500"," you don't want to drink coffee with it, but I've never had a problem personally."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7047900","7059980"," You've taken them every day. Yeah, mental clarity. Can I dig it? Yep. Yes, it should."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7063340","7068380"," Yeah, if you guys, I wouldn't take it if you're like 16 years old, but if you're like 30, 40 years old"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7069260","7075660"," or older, 30 or older, I would say, you can pretty much take it with safety. Don't fucking take that"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7075660","7080700"," shit if you're like 16, you don't need it. But like 30 years or older, shit is banging. Like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7082140","7088780"," of all the vitamins I take, of anything that I've taken, that's like, I have clarity of mind. I"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7088780","7092940"," don't have any, you know, you have like some stuff that's like slightly mind altering or"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7093740","7099500"," you get worn out from it, anything like that. I've never taken a supplement that's made me like,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7099580","7105980"," give me the energy, like whoever said that, like clarity of mind. I didn't know it was good for your"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7105980","7115820"," bones though. Can't take it. Can't do that again though. Can't sleep. People wouldn't take it in the"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7115820","7124460"," morning. Yeah, Adderall's fucked up. So gold, do you think gold's going to ultimate time new highs?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7124460","7129020"," I'm going to go take a break. So I'll look at gold real quick. I saw someone pumping silver earlier."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7130380","7136300"," Sam was going all time new highs too. So look at gold real quick. Nice little,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7136300","7139980"," hopefully you took the, hopefully you took that profit on 445 there. We talked about it up here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7139980","7144940"," right? A little bit lower, we said, right? So you take that little rip. It's a beautiful little"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7144940","7150780"," rip right here. This is really nice. Write that nice little rip and don't diddle in the middle,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7150780","7155900"," right? As the goat says, right? So don't diddle here. Let the banks do this work for you. That's"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7155900","7160860"," what I say. And then if you're going to take this higher, you're going to take it above here,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7160860","7179260"," above this 445. And we'll get gold real quick. Yeah, it's weird. Gold doesn't show too much."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7179260","7192700"," Never does. Gold's a tough one to see. I can tell you that there's more sellers than buyers"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7192700","7199580"," right now. I can tell you that there are lots of call buyers on gold right now. There are more"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7199580","7216940"," sellers than buyers. There are some sellers at 185. 187 would be a price target. 190 for sure."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7217740","7220540"," That's a tough one to get over. That 190 is going to be a tough one to get over."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7221340","7228140"," Just mentally. Price target, 190 on gold."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7232860","7236620"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a quick break. I'm going to leave you guys here for"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7236620","7241260"," just a minute. What I'll do is I'll leave if you guys can, can you guys hear trade the news"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7242060","7245420"," as they're talking or no?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7254060","7261180"," Yeah, I don't take Adderall. I've taken it in the past. Matter of fact,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7262060","7268220"," when I'm in a previous life, I had a, I was a, I'm not going to tell you what I did, but"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7270780","7277020"," if you had like the top five in the country, I was in the top five as a consultant and Adderall"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7277020","7282380"," is a part of that game. That shit is nasty. I guess if you have ADHD, it's great, but"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7283500","7289260"," for the rest of us, we just use it so you can work 100, 200 hours a week and grind and be better"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7289260","7292620"," than everybody else, right? That, like Adderall's fucked up."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7300300","7303260"," Get in, just want more tea, watch balls, shrink every day to peanuts."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7306780","7312780"," Yeah, I think, uh, I think the, I think the DHEA is a hormone precursor for women."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7312780","7318220"," I think for men, it's both, it's both, both hormone and testosterone."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7319420","7323180"," Yeah."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7331420","7335820"," I used to do yoga. I don't do yoga anymore. Now I'm just lifting shingles to the roof and"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7337340","7342940"," I'm breaking my balls right now. I don't just have the time to do yoga right now. I wish I did,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7344860","7345820"," but I do love yoga."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7350220","7352620"," And I want, I want to see that squeeze happen here."

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7380140","7382940"," It's going to do a fucking swan dive here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7386540","7391020"," If it doesn't, if it squeezes higher, we'll be stoked. Be careful right here, if you're a long spy."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7398700","7400220"," Vix is starting to base a little bit."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7409260","7411260"," So"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7433740","7435020"," Be careful. Be careful."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7439260","7455500"," Everything says it's going to, it's going to squeeze. We're either going to fucking squeeze"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7455500","7461580"," the fuck out of this right here. To see you guys know, okay. I don't know if you can see this right"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7461580","7467100"," now, but we're either going to fucking dream by this. We're not going to say it, but we're"

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7546700","7550620"," shell like that, and a little bit test. But for men, it helps with tests. That's a test"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7550620","7556540","osterone precursor that you just stop having when you're like 30 years old."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7559180","7562140"," It's like 10 bucks, not medical advice."

"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7592940","7598060"," Trust me. Don't do that shit if you're young though, because it is bad for you if you're young."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7601500","7604460"," You can look that you can look it up and they'll explain it to you. Like if you,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7604460","7612060"," because your GHEA, or starts to get lower as you get older, like natural, but you'd be like a 16"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7612060","7621420"," year old again. Yeah, that Adderall stuttering speech. That shit's nasty too. When I first did it,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7621420","7627420"," I was taking the 100 milligram capsules one a day in the morning, but it was too much."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7628540","7633020"," You could tell, I could tell. So I leaned off it now. I'm just doing once every three days or so."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7633820","7638620"," Two days, three days, but I love it. It's fucking awesome."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7648060","7650460"," Yeah, I'll come back and do natural gas. I'm gonna take a quick break."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7651180","7654620"," Guys are savages. I gotta take a quick break. We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna rip"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7654620","7660620"," higher right now. We're gonna roll over. If I had to guess, I don't know."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7660780","7666620"," My one problem here is that we haven't fucking closed the gap from yesterday."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7667900","7670780"," So it's like great in on me. We haven't closed the gap from yesterday."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7675260","7677100"," I always like seeing that gap get filled."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7683900","7688780"," So I'll be right back. Okay. And then I'll take a look at natural gas. I like the natural gas trade."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7688780","7691900"," Without even looking at it, I can tell you, do you like natural gas over oil right now?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7695420","7702220"," I don't think that, I think I talked to Joe Harper. I said that we should have a cessation by the"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7702220","7708460"," middle of April, which we do to an extent, but I don't think it's over. They kind of give it like"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7708460","7713980"," a half. The future should not be tied to whether they are talking about here or feel."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7714620","7717740"," We want to see that roll over down here, the nuclear cord."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7720620","7726300"," I hate when this shit happens. If it goes down here, close that gap over there."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7729340","7733340"," See if we can find buyers down here. Support it. If not, we start heading lower."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7735420","7739020"," I'm not saying that's going to happen because we are, we are bull flagging it over here"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7739820","7743900"," for the next leger. I'm in no positions right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7746540","7749660"," I'll be right back. I need a quick break. Take a, take a piss and then, uh,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7750460","7754220"," while I'm taking a break, you should order DHEA and report it back in a day or two."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7754220","7759660"," It'd be hilarious. Got like 160 people to all on DHEA. It's like 10 bucks, dude."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7759660","7764620"," If they, they deliver it in a day, it takes a day for you to get it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7769580","7776460"," Oh, Brater, it's speaking in 30 minutes. Yeah, I, I turned off the, um, the fed"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7776460","7781180"," speaker say, plus we've got, uh, yeah, the other fucking thing is we've got Joe Biden. Hey, if you're,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7784060","7788300"," we got Joe Biden today, economic calendar at 2 30, I think."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7792140","7796380"," And, uh, that shit could, that shit could well and well."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7797180","7803580"," You could see TLT just fucking blast off. Like straight blast off."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7806140","7811420"," There's a bid in TLT today too, probably based upon the bid and TLT today. I'm going to guarantee"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7811420","7816300"," is based, is it based upon, uh, that speech by, by Biden today."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7818060","7820540"," I'm interested to see if there's a real turn in TLT."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7821500","7824620"," If you see a turn in TLT, I'm going to expect the market to go up."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7827100","7830940"," Uh, the, the way that relationship works, I don't see the rollover until later"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7831740","7833420"," from TLT continuing to go up."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7837180","7839420"," You see, you would get brainer at 12 10."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7841180","7846460"," Shit, 20 minutes. Okay, I'll be back in, um, I'll be back for brainer."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7849180","7851100"," Can't figure out why I can't hear you guys."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7851100","7856780"," Or like why I can't hear the desktop audio."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7859580","7864220"," Click to switch off desktop audio properties."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7865580","7866700"," What am I missing here?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7867900","7869500"," Default, wait a minute."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7871500","7875020"," Speakers, wait a minute, I figured it out."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7878060","7880140"," I'm going to do something real quick. I'm going to do a test."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7881100","7885820"," I'm going to go back a little bit, but I'm going to do something real quick."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7888860","7890220"," I'll be a second here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7893340","7896540"," We charge support desk 24 hours a day at support."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7900540","7901820"," Nope, I'm still not hearing it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7901820","7912220"," it. I'm still not here in the, I'm gonna have to turn what I got this, when I get off this"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7912220","7919620"," stream, I'm gonna have to test out and see what I fucked up. No, I fucked that up."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7931820","7951540"," monitor and output and I'm addicted to the game."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7951540","7969460"," I love you. I got some wild shit going on."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7982340","7989620"," I'm hopped up by DHEA. Too funny."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","7989620","8009900"," Yeah, I know what the fuck is going on with this. Okay, so I'll be back here in a"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8009900","8015420"," little bit. I'll be back here at, I'll be back, it's 1154, I'll be back, but we've"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8015420","8022500"," got Brainard coming up here at 1210 I believe. So I'll be back for that speech."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8046220","8061260"," Nice coiling on the spy right now, basing on the VIX. You can see it right"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8061260","8069500"," here. So I'm going to leave this up at 440 in case we trade lower."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8069500","8075540"," 442.75 and then 440 would be the cash gap close."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8459500","8479340"," EIA seeing his crude output, rising under 20,000"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8479340","8490100"," miles per day to 12.01 million miles per day this year, it's down from last month's"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8490100","8496900"," forecast of an 850,000 value per day increase for 2022. Go to EIA."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8719340","8747580"," Turkey reportedly Turkish Central Bank, governors told exporter banks they're"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8747580","8753420"," considering raising the level of Forex revenue they must sell to the Central Bank to 40%"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","8753420","8754620"," and 25%."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9137580","9156580"," Thank you to all of those who are joining us live on Twitter and YouTube governor Brainard, let's get into it this morning the labor department said the consumer crisis rose 1.2% in March to a year over year rate of 8.5% a new 4 decade high."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9156580","9162580"," Seeing weakness in the spy as she's about to speak."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9162580","9170580"," Update from New York City police commissioner saying the shooting incident, the subway in Brooklyn is not being investigated as an act of terrorism."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9170580","9180580"," I think there are two developments in the CPI inflation data of March that were notable."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9180580","9188580"," The commodities price drop associated with Russia's new nation of Ukraine is driving that very high."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9189580","9192580"," It supports on that incident say at least eight people were shot."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9213580","9217580"," Hey you guys shouldn't be picking this up on my mic but you are."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9219580","9224580"," So I got mixer as you just see this morning first afternoon now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9225580","9230580"," There are 3.5% over month about 3.5% in the world."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9231580","9238580"," In the organization this is not a point of question that is said most closely most likely the prices rise in the demand."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9239580","9244580"," And I'm the most focused on the purposes of the spectrum of the public's policy."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9244580","9262580"," The U.K. is driving top line inflation as well, especially energy."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9262580","9275580"," In terms of these overalls, of course, API, we need prices in court with and in responsible problems to help us increase in correlation of the past year."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9275580","9289580"," Even though we mostly come only by full wonder of the overalls, so very often we state the moderation in our voice, and we'll be looking to see whether we continue to see a lot of variations in the mindset at all."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9290580","9302580"," We didn't need some upper fingering or sound waves, and in particular energy price, as we did earlier, but there was some more remaining threats from tomorrow to tomorrow."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9302580","9316580"," I think we can take a lot of this signal and then one month to date, and then we'll be watching some more variations, like the top, moderate, warm, and we'll be finding members probably more than anything outside to fight things."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9316580","9332580"," It seems kind of dovish."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9333580","9356580"," It's really weird. I'm still seeing put buying for the 13th, and for Friday right now, put holders at 440p, 90,000 contract holders."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9356580","9361580"," Brainerd saying getting inflation down is the most important task for the Fed."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9361580","9364580"," They seem to want that cash gap close."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9364580","9367580"," They seem moderation in court goods inflation."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9367580","9372580"," It seems like the spy is liking Brainerd's comment so far."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9372580","9375580"," It's the moderation in inflation in the months ahead. This is Brainerd."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9375580","9378580"," The place is too high right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9402580","9417580"," I agree with that careful on short weeks."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9417580","9425580"," The other thing too is the expectation this morning was a 1.2 or 1.5% move."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9425580","9431580"," Winky's making a very fair point here, which is a huge fucking move, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9431580","9443580"," Spy is up 0.82% currently on the day, but most of that really wasn't cash market either, so we should get a pretty severe move here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9443580","9449580"," We are sitting on a bull flag right now on the spy."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9449580","9458580"," You want me to look at, what were you guys looking?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9458580","9460580"," Take a look here, no sound."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9460580","9467580"," Yeah, that was a way of taking a break."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9467580","9473580"," The big talk that you need to know about too is that 230 we have got."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9473580","9475580"," Are you guys looking for here?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9475580","9481580"," If I rebound in labor force participation."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9481580","9484580"," We've got Biden speaking at 230."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9484580","9490580"," I'll confirm that, but there was some reports yesterday that Biden was going to come out and talk about price."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9490580","9502580"," So we're seeing a nice bounce down below here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9502580","9518580"," Biden and I appear this 445 is that same place."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9518580","9519580"," Oh, I haven't looked up yet."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9519580","9522580"," See if Biden is actually speaking at 230 or not."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9522580","9527580"," He had said yesterday that he had said this, he said back in December 9th too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9527580","9533580"," That was the first time that Biden came out and said, we'll expect a hot CPI print."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9533580","9536580"," It was up a point or something like that."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9536580","9540580"," I'm not a point but point one."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9540580","9545580"," We ended up going up for two days before we saw the market just rolled over."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9545580","9549580"," Just rotation trade, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9549580","9555580"," That was my thought process here is that you get that rotation trade for another couple of days"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9555580","9560580"," and lead into let's call up the 18th or 20th."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9560580","9564580"," We sell the market out by then or sell the market down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9564580","9568580"," Then we make one more attempt at a run higher in the May."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9568580","9570580"," I don't think we get that run into man."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9570580","9571580"," I think it's a false breakout."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9571580","9578580"," We trade sideways."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9578580","9582580"," We have Biden, I think at 230 and he was."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9582580","9588580"," I think he was basically talking about price controls or what they can do for price controls"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9588580","9593580"," and I don't know what they can do."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9593580","9599580"," I don't know what options they have."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9599580","9601580"," When it comes to."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9601580","9604580"," Every can be sustained even as they bring inflation down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9604580","9607580"," Just pure greed."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9607580","9608580"," That's all it is, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9608580","9609580"," To some extent."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9609580","9617580"," There's some shortages but the only real action that they could take would be if there was"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9617580","9624580"," some kind of a emergency rate hike that we don't know about at 230."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9624580","9635580"," If he were to announce something like that."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9635580","9641580"," Maybe taxation would work as well."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9641580","9644580"," That might be why people are buying all these puts too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9644580","9648580"," Just heads up that they're buying them."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9648580","9657580"," They've been loading up on them all day long."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9657580","9659580"," Not that I can blame them either."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9659580","9664580"," If you're looking at a pull back a little bit."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9664580","9667580"," It seems reasonable here."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9667580","9671580"," You're talking about."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9671580","9674580"," It's kind of where it's at, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9674580","9676580"," This is natural."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9676580","9678580"," I wish we'd gotten up here if we didn't."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9678580","9683580"," This is a natural place for us to start selling it down again."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9683580","9686580"," Looking for better positioning."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9686580","9700580"," I see the point."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9701580","9706580"," I get it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9706580","9729580"," This looks bearish on one hour, Charlie's bearish."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9730580","9735580"," But it also looks like it's basing too."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9735580","9739580"," There's lots of put buying right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9739580","9768580"," The thing with what they can do is they can, you know,"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9768580","9773580"," buy never came out today and said we're doing 50 points today."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9773580","9775580"," Market would sell right the fuck off."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9775580","9778580"," We're already at 5%."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9778580","9781580"," We're kind of already there in some respects."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9781580","9788580"," Really not enough."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9788580","9797580"," In reality, then what you're going to find inflation is taking enough money away from people."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9797580","9800580"," They don't have the money to spend on goods, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9800580","9803580"," They can't afford to buy."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9803580","9806580"," Not being consistent with bringing inflation down."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9806580","9807580"," I don't know."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9807580","9814580"," Everything's expensive right now."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9814580","9830580"," In reality, you want the unemployment rate higher."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9830580","9843580"," Everything's really expensive right now as it is."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9843580","9866580"," I'd say either higher taxes."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9866580","9868580"," Yeah, he could announce it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9868580","9878580"," The Fed Share basically works at the..."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9878580","9886580"," Not behest, but..."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9886580","9888580"," I'm assuming we're going to get some."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9888580","9889580"," It's 12.25."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9889580","9893580"," We've got two hours left."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9893580","9897580"," I assume that could put some volatility to the market."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9897580","9906580"," That you'd have an emergency rate hike announced or some form of..."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9906580","9910580"," You know, he's going to propose taxes of some kind."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9910580","9912580"," He can call whatever he wants to call it."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9912580","9914580"," There is a much that they can do."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9914580","9922580"," I'm not saying this works overall, but..."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9922580","9930580"," You really have to break."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9930580","9933580"," There's only a few ways you can break people, right?"
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9933580","9936580"," We already know that we've got high inflation."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9936580","9938580"," That's breaking people, but everybody's working."
"PkEz76Y0Dkk","9938580","9941580"," Everybody's got savings."
