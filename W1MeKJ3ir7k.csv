"173410","175150"," It was good, it was long."
"175510","177030"," I'm a little banged up this morning."
"178910","184330"," So first I, on Thursday, I lost my voice. "
"185290","193430"," Like Thursday night, I was talking with someone from a participant of the show here after the"
"193430","197510"," close, Thursday close."
"198130","202410"," And when I got off the phone with him, I lost my voice, like gone."
"203090","204150"," I couldn't speak anymore. "
"205450","211090"," So I attempted to not speak for a few more days."
"211970","218530"," Right now at this moment this morning, it's kind of feeling alright, but it's on the cusp of losing"
"218530","219050"," it still."
"219610","226450"," So I think I might have done some damage or maybe not, I don't think it's permanent, but how I"
"226450","236290"," came to that conclusion was I had forgotten I had forgotten I had forgotten, be careful here, we're"
"236290","238730"," probably going to go down if you're wondering. "
"240590","248210"," I had forgotten that the last two weeks was kind of one long run on long week."
"248930","256670"," Pass like, so not this week, but last week and the week prior, it was to me just one long"
"256670","261890"," blur and lots of excitement in the market."
"262130","265230"," So of course, it never really truly ended, right?"
"265390","266850"," It just carried over into the weekend. "
"267950","271950"," The name of what side of that trade you were on, you know, is a good time and for some"
"271950","272950"," people it was a really bad time."
"273070","274850"," I started posting on Wall Street Bets."
"275450","282990"," Someone lost six or seven hundred thousand dollars during that run up and so I'm assuming for some"
"282990","288230"," people it was a really rough ride and for some of you it was a great ride, right?"
"288610","290810"," It was an exciting time on the show as well. "
"291230","299370"," So my voice is not within this one, but then another thing happened I got banged up yesterday I"
"299370","309270"," took a beating on my knees and behind my knees I was water skiing and I got fucked up"
"309270","315530"," pretty bad bad enough that I was considering going to the hospital or to my doctor."
"317630","323770"," Kind of thing where I should be lying down right now I think with my legs straight out."
"326690","332290"," And we've got like we just finished our plans for here's your rug pull right here we have a pre "
"332290","337330","-market test right here coming up and we're breaking through right now. "
"338050","347650"," We have a small window of weakness from today until the 23rd and I read some I'm not gonna say"
"347650","352070"," who but I read one note this morning and they're fascinating to read because they're getting better"
"352070","355790"," at covering up their calls."
"356410","360590"," So what they said what their point was and I think we talked about this last week I was like"
"360590","364930"," yeah the 20th to 23rd pretty much have a decent window for some down."
"366030","371350"," Now this morning I read their note and they said into end of month and I was like oh so"
"371350","377490"," you're giving yourself an entire end of the month to get some down right?"
"378350","380250"," So they're getting better at writing their notes. "
"380590","385630"," I want you to know your window of weakness is likely today into the 23rd."
"385730","390490"," I told you that I think a week or two ago so I don't know they probably have to say"
"390490","395510"," that because they've been wrong so frequently that they're just like fuck it we'll just start"
"395510","403050"," writing notes so that it covers every base the clock can be right for the next two weeks we can"
"403050","406950"," go to the moon tomorrow but if we're down in a week or two we'll say we told you that"
"406950","407390"," we were down."
"408050","413970"," So there's probably some kind of window weakness here there's not as many puts in the market"
"413970","422250"," believe it or not mature puts and new puts I mean more new puts will come in but options complex"
"422250","426530"," is pretty clear I'll take a look at it again this morning maybe I'm wrong maybe it's changed since"
"426530","436270"," then everybody and their mother is loaded to the tits and puts but just the heads up so good"
"436270","441330"," morning to all of you out there we'll look at that this morning we'll look at the options market"
"441330","447530"," and see what it's showing us can we go down here it'd be nice to see us go down at"
"447530","452150"," least some some of the other things that I read over the weekend try to get away from the market"
"452150","456190"," a little bit believe it or not but some of the stuff that I have read maybe you can keep"
"456190","461550"," me up to date or something like that as to what they're saying out there I read something else that"
"461550","470050"," said I read another note from the weekend that said this is probably the top and not only is it"
"470050","475670"," probably the top you should get long dated puts but keep buying the market and I'm like oh shit if"
"475670","481890"," you do that you start loading up the fuck you start loading up the gills and buy the market you"
"481890","488230"," know what that does right it sends us to the fucking moon sends us to all-time highs I think"
"488230","492790"," the note also said don't buy calls because the call wall is not but 450 or something like that"
"492790","499710"," that's likely the top you know I'm like you get some call expansion up there and you're loading up"
"499710","504910"," puts we'll go to the fucking moon right and that was kind of the point that I was making to"
"504910","513570"," the last couple weeks was if you're buying the market and you're able to buy put protection and"
"513570","522010"," everyone is well hedged we're gonna go up so you kind of need that to have that market structure"
"522010","527090"," that good market structure that kind of stuff so we'll see all that plays out we'll talk about like"
"527090","535030"," a correction or two we could have and you know is this the top or is 450 the top or"
"535030","542990"," 460 or all-time highs I don't think it really matters at this point but we're gonna talk about it"
"542990","550490"," we'll take some time let's talk about that today as well you know and the truth here is this you"
"550490","556770"," know I was trying to come up with this a way to put this but you know price action is"
"556770","566050"," always king and some of the notes that I read over from this weekend I was like I don't know"
"566050","573210"," why you can't just tell people that I don't know why because it goes again when it goes against you"
"573210","580630"," you can lose big you know if you're like well this guy said this that guy doesn't know that guy"
"580630","585890"," with those people or whatever you'll play them and play themselves out with big words and over"
"585890","592470"," complication of what really does matter and oftentimes it's just price action that does matter"
"593270","597750"," until we structurally look like we're gonna start crashing this market or that was the top or"
"597750","607690"," something like that con that early is kind of kind of rubs me the wrong way so anyways we"
"607690","614890"," know another cool part I don't know we'll talk with that later but OS3 we went to I went just"
"614890","622390"," any of you out there that paid for tickets I guess somebody gave a big tip one day I forget"
"622390","628510"," who it was exactly and I said you know what I said I'll take the girls out to a concert"
"628510","636170"," so I took them to Charlie Puth on I believe that was I think that might have been on Father's"

"683410","688750"," it's the it's the act of buying t-shirt concert I guess kids love it and they stood in line"

"1095830","1105730"," up here so you already know what can you"
"1105730","1110850"," derive from this you get the levels from me every morning right you guys want to drive some some"
"1110850","1120770"," ideas here and you know base case number one right if you're a seller if you sold"
"1120770","1127250"," the bell congratulations but if you are a seller you know that we're below the pivot right see"
"1127250","1133870"," where that is see your below trend below the early trigger prices below the one the five the hourly"
"1133870","1143930"," right one two three trigger cluster to the downside it's all telling you the way is down it's"
"1143930","1148990"," just a matter of positioning from that point as a positioning from here and we're closing this gap"
"1148990","1153890"," I don't know but I know that all we're below all this stuff so we should have a few good"
"1153890","1161010"," down days maybe two more down days let's say we're looking for in the spy so every day tend to"
"1161010","1169650"," come up another one two three let's call it let's call it 430 so somewhere down here oh there it"
"1169650","1181560"," is right there 430 this is cap jim's price target right here cjj price"
"1181560","1191690"," target hopefully we can get there cap jim jim's price target right"
"1191690","1199050"," there that's what I want to hit right there blows out a little gap down there and see it right"
"1199050","1205070"," there could take us two days to get there that's what I'm hoping for the hourly trigger our daily"
"1205070","1214330"," trigger is slightly higher for today it's at 425 almost right down here do I think we can get there"
"1214330","1221270"," today no I'll try to be more conservative than I think by the time we get here this will have"
"1221270","1226730"," moved up is my point I think this line is like boom boom by the time we actually get there"
"1226730","1235430"," so we got a hourly trigger we have s2 we're heading towards it right now if you guys are in"
"1235430","1242950"," puts congrats I haven't opened up my trading my brokerage yet to get anything so we've got s2 down"

"2062239","2084889"," I wonder if they initiated a short position GPM with a short position you'll"
"2084889","2094510"," think they'll say buy buy lemonade once we're back to $14 when it assumes so GPM is a short to"
"2094510","2101470"," $14 on lemonade here so let's talk about when we're down here so we're down here we're breaking"
"2101470","2108130"," right now the daily trigger on LMD and we still have not broken the weekly trigger and we have not"
"2108130","2115910"," broken trend down here either one two right there and this is where JPM wants to buy lemonade they"
"2115910","2120250"," don't want to buy it here they don't want to buy it here they want to break down here and"
"2120250","2127370"," then take that long again I'm assuming so we will look at lemonade as we're going to set two"
"2127370","2132930"," targets here and we'll set alerts for them and we're going to set lemonade up as a as an example"
"2132930","2142580"," of buying a dip we're going to go through an exercise here ready"
"2145040","2154060"," so on lemonade right second I'll work this out in a calculator so JPM is shorting this to $14 I"
"2154060","2158600"," was a note that was put out by them this morning we are looking for a dip to buy on"
"2158600","2167200"," this ticker and we've got 17 17 with daily trigger at 17 is 86"
"2167200","2182060"," so one here calculator 1755"
"2192430","2210690"," next one at 1632 JPM"
"2210690","2220670"," is short at 14 3..."
"2222350","2229650"," so if you buy if you add to a position first what you do is you set your alerts right"
"2229650","2234730"," here then you set another alert right here and another alert right down here and that gives you a"
"2234730","2240990"," total buy-in of $16 so every to buy this dip here right buy this dip here buy this dip"
"2240990","2259480"," here it gives you a DCA of $15.95 DCA"
"2259480","2264280"," right here so we're going to draw this out and we're going to review this and I'm going to set"
"2264280","2273140"," an alert down here and review this right here so we're going to go down right and hopefully we can"
"2273140","2283780"," get down there and we'll come right back up here BAM BAM continue our move higher so"
"2283780","2290460"," we're going to remember this ticker right here we're going to pretend that this morning we bought"
"2290460","2296140"," the dip here and we're going to buy the dip again we're going to buy the dip again and we're"
"2296140","2309670"," going to put our stops underneath of stops underneath here and we're"

"2314390","2322030"," a quick capitulation move we'll grab one more at 1250 or something like that 13 bucks so we're"
"2322030","2328690"," going to track this over the coming week so I think we're down for like three days three out of"
"2328690","2332570"," four days this week so we're going to track this one down here over three days we're going to see"
"2332570","2341910"," if lemonade recovers and how to buy a dip this is a good example for us to spend time when"
"2341910","2349150"," you should be buying dips or not buying dips where do you have a stop underneath so that when"
"2349150","2355590"," you're buying a dip when you're buying a dip you're the guy that's down here right?"
"2355810","2363690"," you're like the guy buying this buying this and buying this you're not buying this top you're not"

"2381550","2386070"," lemonade is going to fucking full zeros negative it's going negative it's going to go negative 10"
"2386070","2394530"," you're going to owe them money and what we'll do is we'll run that same thing here we're going to"
"2394530","2403730"," run that same kind of thing over here and then when we're up here you'll be the happy person next"
"2403730","2410630"," thing remember we exited rocket lab the other day and I'm like I'm out people are like woo we're"
"2410630","2415010"," going to the moon and I'm like yeah I already bought that kind of shit down there and I'm happy"
"2415010","2419190"," and on to the next time for that trade as well and on to the next time for that trade"

"2440330","2448770"," is underneath here right get above start coming down here that's all fine still on track what I"
"2448770","2458620"," don't want to see what I don't want to see in lemonade is some kind of a new"
"2458620","2465280"," low and then a continuation to the downside anything like this is no go if this was a liquidity"
"2465280","2473520"," grab up here maybe again to break below I'm going to be concerned so on lemonade we'll show that"
"2473520","2483820"," previous low down there make that four put that as a regular white line right there we'll"
"2483820","2490300"," put this as a tradable area for lemonade I'm actually going to lower my stops down here I might"
"2490300","2495280"," actually add some at ten bucks if we ever get that low I don't personally think that we do but"
"2495280","2501080"," if we do we get down here there's any way that it's something like this we'll keep buying those"
"2501080","2506680"," dips all along the way for lemonade but I'm not bearish on lemonade I'm just looking for a dip buy"
"2506680","2515960"," anywhere to get a good price so there you go lemonade we'll look back on this one matter of fact"

"2554680","2569000"," this message right there we go done"
"2569000","2575760"," and that's right on this line you'll see it we'll keep track of it the truth being told if I"
"2575760","2580540"," had the chance I'd fucking love to buy it at ten bucks but I don't think that we do I"
"2580540","2612600"," think we're trending up overall so unless we get something different there's lemonade there"

"3258060","3267040"," you had an abdominal effect shit you have like Korea, Vietnam you have like"
"3267040","3274840"," proxy it's weird too I read a not to this guy these are like futurists that write books and stuff"

"3307520","3315200"," 21st century if you haven't read that book I recommend that you do because it'll give you at least"
"3315200","3324840"," a grasp as to why we make certain people the bad guys who are the people to really be watching"
"3324840","3331280"," out there as an American or if you're an American who you really want to be watching out there and"
"3331280","3337380"," then what it really does though is it's fascinating look at why do we fight why do we fight in"
"3337380","3346540"," Iraq and Afghanistan those kind of places the backbone of that reasoning clue you in when I say"
"3346540","3354880"," things to you like a couple weeks ago I had said to you see a proxy war with Russia you"

"3368140","3374360"," I don't think anyone else is a hyper power I think we are the only hyper power in the world"
"3374360","3382300"," and should reclass and put that into our zeitgeist lexicon at some point that the US is a hyper"
"3382300","3388740"," power you can't compare them to China or Russia you could if you want to say hey China and Russia"
"3388740","3396320"," is a superpower maybe because of nukes you guess you could maybe throw indian on that one but"

"3412300","3418320"," with it it gives a great firm outline as to some of the stuff that I talked about in the"
"3418320","3426500"," show and so it's kind of fascinating in economic cycles how we begin to have worse relationships"
"3426500","3435700"," with specific countries out there you know you don't want the US or not some of you want some of"
"3435700","3441020"," you want the some of you want us burning tires in New York City I know that some of you"

"3457840","3466860"," of these nations to have some sort of threat of war or even proxy wars not using their own people"
"3466860","3475920"," or people that are that are maybe minorities you see a lot of the fighters from Russia or not"
"3475920","3483840"," they're not muscovites right most of them are not muscovites you know using the drags of society or"

"3489980","3497080"," that fighting it's gross it's not nice but you see that like you see that development and you see"
"3497080","3502820"," technology information age you see smart people like what you know what if we go if we start"
"3502820","3509980"," threatening the US and the US starts threatening us we can have our war machine kick up right and"

"3755340","3764700"," buy it here personally but ALGM gonna add that one to the list ALGM"
"3768520","3777860"," Allegro micro systems nice squeeze here trading above its hourly trigger if it can come back down"
"3777860","3794460"," and tag its hourly or daily we'll look to buy this one $40 "
"3794460","3804740",".40 I don't want to read that stuff down"
"3804740","3814700"," here 39 62 another one down here it's weekly 35 hopefully this"
"3814700","3824560"," one will cool off ALGM if it does stay above it's it does stay above"
"3824560","3830340"," 41 46 I think it reraces all of it but keep an eye on it if you want to day"
"3830340","3837500"," trade it today 41 45 right you guys know 41 45 will be the place to see if it continues"

"3877250","3883230"," BRZ got bought right down here before you even got there it is coiling it's a little long in the"
"3883230","3889630"," tooth in my view it's a little long in the tooth I don't like seeing this daily so high as"
"3889630","3894650"," it is but it is coiling right now keep an eye on it as a day trade to the upside"
"3894650","3903590"," today it is sitting on a one five and hourly it keeps being bought right now BRZ is the ticker"
"3905190","3913730"," the idea here would be it would need to stay above for day trader it needs to stay above 41"
"3913730","3922230"," 68 so if it can stay above 41 68 still targeted the upside I think this one is a little"
"3923090","3936020"," long in the tooth here but now there was one tag down below the next one is down here for"
"3936020","3942200"," a day trade keep an eye on it if it does if it becomes shortable if it breaks below this"
"3942200","3955000"," a couple times I would be loving to grab it down here at like 35 bucks BRZ then"
"3955000","3964840"," we have what else we got here I've got an alert"
"3964840","3979140"," saying that shoals is almost ready to buy again then CRDO still"

"4001620","4004900"," it will look like Rocket Lab yet either I want to see it come back down to like five bucks"
"4008320","4014680"," SON I'm looking at my alerts here in the background when to buy or not some nice fucking shorts in"
"4014680","4028920"," here SOUN might be a good short SOUN it's"
"4028920","4036020"," short down to like three dollars trade in 351 right now try to send it down to close to three"
"4036020","4050010"," bucks SOUN for a short I"
"4050010","4062620"," want to see if it holds that three bucks it bounces a little bit"
"4062620","4071180"," of take the money and run here we'll see if bears can reject a test of the five minute above"
"4071180","4084710"," on spy at 436 67 see if sellers can stay selling here there's"

"4164399","4169920"," if it'll come back down and test that three bucks and take off north again I'm ultimately bullish"
"4169920","4178640"," on SOUN I just think it needs to cool off I shouldn't say that I'm bearish completely on it but"
"4178640","4188200"," it looks like a volatile looks like it's got some volatility it's got a lot of volume on it too"
"4188200","4200600"," so be careful out there with that one would"
"4200600","4206080"," I go over a possible spy entry sure so what do you look what do you so I have a"
"4206080","4213580"," question inside the chat Ian trades says hey cap would you mind going over a possible spy entry so"

"4248060","4254640"," relief bounce here we always talk about if this chart was upside down right now we're bullish right"
"4254640","4260360"," we would tell you that this yellow vertical line right here when price is vertical below here it's"
"4260360","4267420"," very bearish or bullish in this case and then once we have the price target achieved pivoting that"
"4267420","4272720"," you're going to look for a retest of the five minute right you always come back up here test this"
"4272720","4280580"," five minute see if we can get some continuation to the downside for the spoos so we're going to be"
"4280580","4287740"," checking for an entry on a put above right here okay so right up in here somewhere we're looking"
"4287740","4293140"," for some kind of a retest fed flip this chart upside down for you right now this is what you'd"
"4293140","4297700"," be looking for right so pretend we're bullish right now and then we're flipping this over and we're"
"4297700","4303900"," going up so we're going up and we have the first initial move you checked it or now turn your"
"4303900","4311780"," TV's upside down right go blast up and we do a quick pullback it's about 11 a.m. and you're"

"4319100","4323800"," down here right at least want to check this we just want to make sure that we're not going to"
"4323800","4329240"," do a double bottom and go higher right so we want to at least check this and see if we"
"4329240","4337160"," can get down there so your next entry for puts Ian is right up here it's probably right below this"
"4337160","4344200"," 436 64 pay attention to this yellow line right here too this is that pre-market the yellow line is"
"4344200","4349380"," that pre-market pivot so they might try to jump in here I'm going to expect sellers to start buying"
"4349380","4359340"," some puts here here and here for continued downside moves so would"
"4359340","4366560"," I buy a put right here right where we are right on this little thing right here no so what"

"4390240","4400210"," looking at it's right here and Kevin Jim James wants more down I want to I want"
"4400210","4406710"," to bloodbath in the marketplace which I do the lower we get the faster we go better it is for"
"4406710","4416310"," me to buy a dip so I always like cheaper so what I'm looking for here personally so I'm like"
"4416310","4426280"," this some hoping for push down below target right"
"4426280","4435940"," down there something like this that's what I want to see now that might not happen right"
"4437740","4444500"," that might not happen I don't want to get caught in this and why don't I want to get caught"
"4444500","4450700"," in this like this right here because they can go the other way right we can actually squeeze up"
"4450700","4458680"," here and then attack this five minute up here right and then you're caught and you're like shit"
"4458680","4464200"," about puts and it didn't have stops on I got squeezed up here the train was actually up here to"
"4464200","4469720"," the downside and we're getting all fucked up so I'm looking for this right now so like this is"
"4469720","4476180"," what's in my mind right this isn't what's gonna happen this is what I think right so I'm looking at"
"4476180","4481380"," this right now so if I'm gonna set some puts up do I buy the puts like right now fuck"
"4481380","4491340"," no fuck no I want to look for like get underneath again right I want"
"4491340","4496360"," to see price go underneath I want to see first see the rejection I want to see the price go"
"4496360","4501980"," underneath begin to reject more and I want to have the trade set up already to take the trade so"
"4501980","4509900"," we're gonna watch this play out for some more puts to the downside now let's say we get squeezed"
"4509900","4518320"," right like slam it squeeze up here right I'm gonna set the same thing the same set up in here"
"4518320","4524440"," draw to another box there another box there hopefully this ping pong get underneath it right air"
"4524440","4533120"," and bam to the downside you know what I'm saying so is so there was a down trade right see"
"4533120","4540460"," the box above you can actually see it see that box actually the box right there that was the paying"
"4540460","4548960"," move that was the extension and then right in here this is no man's land right that's no man's land"
"4548960","4554500"," some people try to call that stuff but for me it's like set puts up and just get the print"
"4554500","4562700"," and then get out so right in here that's what I'm looking for make sense keep my eyes on this"
"4562700","4568040"," it's 11 11 right now I'm gonna watch the time it's 11 11 a.m. right we got where is"
"4568040","4576020"," 11 right there failure to get a new low for the sellers they have five that was on the hourly"
"4576020","4579540"," and I feel you get a new low so sellers need to get a new low here in the next"
"4579540","4586100"," four minutes I'm expecting a big fat red fucking bar right there to get underneath sellers want to"
"4586100","4591680"," get rid underneath this six EMA and they want they need to get a new low believe it or not"
"4591680","4596460"," so I'm hoping for a what you would call a liquidation break or something to me a bloodbath in there"
"4596460","4602640"," so watch this bar in the next four minutes and see what happens here I'm betting you already buying"
"4602640","4612800"," put you like slam by the put button yeah"

"4675280","4681120"," look at something else that's important to see so is the bloodbath in the top of the key here is"
"4681120","4685620"," the bloodbath from up here positioning will matter in this trade the killer is not gonna want to"
"4685620","4692260"," pay the trade to the downstairs we got this one right here all right you got one two and we're"

"7233650","7237710"," parse I'm finding it hard to parse how many"
"7237710","7247370"," people are in Reddit threads and then how much of it is astroturfing?"
"7249710","7257630"," and the motivations behind all these different people what I do find mostly fascinating about it is"
"7257630","7267590"," or the most fascinating thing about it is I've been through I was on some message boards"
"7267590","7277550"," when I was young but like the large migrations but I've seen I've seen like where"
"7277550","7287170"," I was like conscience of it happening the first big one was probably FARC, Myspace migrations to"
"7287170","7296470"," and from and you have like Facebook Reddit has gone through it a few times not migrations but"
"7296470","7304470"," really weird changes over the years and then but this is smelling when my point here is the Yahoo"
"7304470","7313650"," message boards AOL that was way back when but I wasn't as conscious of it then Reddit is smelling"
"7313650","7325590"," like it it's smelling like a mass migration even if it isn't showing itself right now it's"
"7325590","7336780"," smelling like it like"
"7336780","7342240"," there will be one watch out for a break here I'm gonna try to take your stops out right now"
"7342240","7350320"," I'm trying to sell this right now they're pretty pissy no matter"
"7350320","7359640"," how it resolves itself right now I thought originally I was like these fucking people that are"
"7359640","7365960"," bitching on Reddit I was like as soon as they're pro stop protesting I'll just go back to what it"
"7365960","7373840"," was but then when the Astro Turfin and the I"
"7373840","7382900"," see it I can see anything here but I can't I wanna sell this I can assure you that you"
"7382900","7401850"," can see it I wanna sell this shit right down here so"
"7401850","7411700"," I'm gonna put a stop limit on my calls but I'm not gonna tell you what it is you do"
"7411700","7418760"," your own thing I'm gonna put one on there because and I'm not gonna tell you because I don't want"

"7425380","7435590"," be like yeah there are stops right here so I"
"7435590","7442170"," think the reddit thing is for like a few moments I was like maybe it's just a small group of"
"7442170","7449810"," you know people bitching about the changes to Reddit and I get the whole story I get that they're"
"7449810","7458270"," not their API that they're Reddit's kind of broken right their reader sucks new Reddit is a fucking"
"7458270","7466910"," dumpster fire and it's a fucking dumpster fire it matter of fact I only read and only I've ever"
"7466910","7473750"," read Reddit on the old Reddit I don't even deal with it anymore it's that when they try to push"
"7473750","7477250"," that new Reddit shit on me I was like get the fuck out here and it only got worse and"
"7477250","7481170"," the other readers that are out there that are really good I don't bother I just do it old Reddit"
"7481170","7489110"," I don't do old Reddit and matter of fact I'm not even that not on Reddit as much as I"
"7489110","7495950"," was on Reddit from day one so the years have passed I don't like Reddit anymore anyways not a fan"
"7495950","7504410"," of it generally speaking not a fan of it anymore so"
"7504410","7511070"," but I do wonder I've been checking in lately spending more time on it lately and it looks like it"
"7511070","7520870"," smells like a mass migration is coming and you do know that the decentralized options"
"7523350","7530710"," are not good they're I was talking to a friend and I was like I was like you know it"
"7530710","7536330"," would be great if anyone was in if anyone was in the position to be a replacement in my view"
"7537390","7547150"," if there was one there's one platform that was in a position to do it it would"
"7547150","7557130"," be a discord if discord could have like a main page just like Reddit does just have"
"7557130","7563970"," like a main page for like all the discord communities to have a place to go and you can be"
"7563970","7571070"," seen like right when you logged into discord maybe you have like a main thing that discord"
"7571070","7576750"," communities would be a part of more activity the more posts there are I guess something built"
"7576750","7584610"," around that discord would be fucking awesome to do that like I know that they've got the sellers"
"7584610","7591290"," just stepping in right now they're trying to get trying to fucking bull trap so there's like they"
"7591290","7597750"," were able to like somehow like take the best of what rep makes were what made Reddit great I think"
"7597750","7605290"," they're they're in the best positioning they have some of the best part of like those migrations"
"7605290","7615170"," usually stem from distrust by user bases that are unrecoverable or"
"7615170","7623760"," an easier it is two so two sided distrust by user base and then the second issue is ease of"
"7623760","7630600"," use and what I don't like about all the alternatives right now is that they're even more"
"7633300","7640400"," compartmentalized there's like a lot of these things are like bigger echo chambers for you and echo"
"7640400","7647300"," chambers kind of suck right you don't you don't quite want twitter where it's the algorithms are"
"7647300","7653480"," built for you to fight with everybody or see things that make you angry but you want that like"
"7653480","7661720"," natural you want that natural like exploration right so you're not particularly looking for"
"7661720","7668660"," something you stumble upon it and you're like oh this is awesome found this cool and then of course"
"7668660","7675620"," you want natural conversations by people that might know more than Wikipedia I've always found that"
"7675620","7685580"," fascinating too because if you've if you've ever if you've ever been"
"7685580","7691260"," in business if you've ever been in the military is another good example it was a good way for you"
"7691260","7696400"," to see this so if you're in the military if you were ever in a C suite if you were"
"7696400","7704500"," ever on the front side of a company and you know the inner workings of that company if you have"
"7704500","7711240"," ever been in acting if you've ever been not acting just the entertainment industry if you've ever"
"7711240","7719920"," been if you ever read newspapers have you ever had any connection to news media in any way shape or"

"7729840","7740700"," creating video content and it kind of stuff isn't always exactly what truly happened you"
"7740700","7744880"," know that right some of you don't send me a conspiracy there it's not really conspiracy it's just"
"7744880","7753160"," that people haven't they want to sell a story but when you're when you have those like two key"
"7753160","7759820"," things natural exploration where you're like oh I just happened upon this you're actually not a"
"7759820","7764680"," rocket scientist the algorithms are able to get that stuff in front of you and then the second part"
"7764680","7770820"," would be that the conversation behind it is sometimes more real and not necessarily a conspiracy"
"7770820","7776700"," theory or just what's being regurgitated by Wikipedia or you know fucking CNN or Fox news or"
"7776700","7783860"," whatever so you're not seeing that is like you're not seeing that anymore on Reddit like you get"

"7800520","7806060"," Facebook kind of became like that I don't know if I'm on the same some people are saying that the"
"7806060","7812740"," alternative is whatever X is going to be and then some people are saying that the alternative is"
"7813540","7821580"," the Instagram I guess Instagram is going to launch a competitor to Reddit I don't know that either"
"7821580","7829180"," of those have what Discord has which is that like they have that they have that last piece of the"
"7829180","7836720"," puzzle and that's the um trust and people hate Discord still like you'll see videos of you being"
"7836720","7843200"," like Discord's not the same Discord sucks now all this other shit but the masses don't hate Discord"
"7844660","7856010"," so I'm fascinated if there's ever going to be something like that come out Discord or not now I"

"9655930","9661350"," can actually get continuation here to the upside on NASDAQ and go higher believe it or not that's"
"9661350","9668990"," possible because of the market that we're actually in not the platitudes that you read on the"
"9668990","9676230"," internet now saying that we just took this trade here right we entered at the perfect time right"
"9676230","9684430"," and we're up in here and we made some money saying that you have no trade up here I want"
"9684430","9689510"," you to know that you don't have a fucking trade now we can speculate that we're going to smash and"
"9689510","9697430"," squeeze above this right we can speculate on that it's a risky trade though it can reverse on you"
"9697430","9703790"," just as easily here we want high probability trades that are going to pay so if this is a little"
"9703790","9709330"," reverse here we're going to tell you that's a bear chart bulltrops hey sucker you got caught okay"
"9709330","9715970"," yeah fuck you too what you can do though is you can look for the signs of continuation to the"

"9736230","9744590"," cool trades here here's a trade down and up right breakthrough we know the hourly is becoming"
"9744590","9752070"," bullish this is one trade right here I still think that's kind of risky personally what I would"
"9752070","9760310"," really like to do so we got this trade right here I'd really like to see maybe you buy calls"
"9760310","9769970"," on the break to go higher and fail up here or even the really nice trade is this one"
"9769970","9795920"," and that would be letting all this play out and"
"9795920","9803100"," letting the rest of the market play this if you're a bull okay letting all this play out here and"
"9803100","9808560"," catching price action above the hourly the one on the five for this bigger move here there's like a"
"9808560","9815380"," second move in here that's not quite there right now but this is the most probable one that pays so"
"9815380","9820820"," like you can make money in here you can put risk on in here like the putting risk on trade"
"9820820","9827800"," though is is higher so you have this putting risk on trade you make money on that trade and you"

"9833980","9838740"," blows up as a countdown for the fifth trade so just be aware of it as we come up here"
"9839880","9846620"," so we're coming up to squeeze it right now you know that the sellers have stepped in and previous"
"9846620","9854580"," examples here here see them right here so it looks extremely bullish right now the hourly velocity"
"9854580","9858320"," though is on your side first squeeze above right now so hourly velocity is on your side squeeze"
"9858320","9863800"," above but we do know that sellers are waiting up here you know they're sitting here waiting we know"
"9863800","9868620"," they don't care if you go up here we know that they're hoping and expecting the squeeze higher here"
"9868620","9875980"," so they can jump on another short of queues and NASDAQ okay we'll take a look at the spy real"
"9875980","9885740"," quick SPY same kind of a deal right spy can come back down here and check it's one minute"
"9885740","9890980"," just like the bears did earlier right you don't get caught and rolled over there right you don't"

"10918110","10921630"," And we've got PMI on Friday, some more good ball."
"10926820","10933520"," It's like two days of, two days of general fucking volatility with Jerome."
"10934720","10936900"," And it mostly stems from not him. "
"10937120","10940960"," It's usually those, it's usually like the senators that create that stupid fucking wall."
"10945290","10948890"," You think Jay Paz says, did it dependent all the women's wound?"

"11012200","11016820"," Zame interested to sell the senate hearing tomorrow."
"11023370","11024630"," Let's take a look and see where we are. "
"11024990","11028290"," So for this week, right, we know there's demand down here."
"11028370","11028750"," We can tell."
"11030390","11032970"," Sellers did not get their dreams of doom and destruction. "
"11034330","11037230"," We know that the demand was down here last week, right?"
"11037530","11038550"," We got one, two."
"11039390","11041490"," I believe this was Friday, right?"
"11042170","11043350"," And then this is today is Tuesday."
"11044530","11049130"," So you saw the demand step back and we know currently right now at this moment that there are"
"11049130","11049930"," buyers down here. "
"11051010","11052110"," We know they're down here."
"11053030","11054410"," I'm buying the fuck out of this."
"11057010","11058470"," I guess we can keep it. "
"11058610","11059610"," We'll say that they're right there."
"11059710","11060110"," How about that?"
"11060390","11061490"," Let's say the buyers are right there."
"11062690","11064830"," So we've got buyers, buyers, buyers. "
"11065970","11067410"," They have not left as of yet."
"11069190","11073530"," We also know that sellers want to stay underneath this trend, right?"
"11074710","11075530"," Extend this into tomorrow."
"11080060","11081560"," That's the biggest thing that they're happy. "
"11082060","11086020"," Like the biggest thing, if you're a seller, it's not, we're not, like if you're a seller, don't"
"11086020","11086620"," fare just yet."
"11088100","11092780"," You still own underneath trend, right?"
"11093060","11093740"," So you still have this."
"11093900","11094620"," You've still got underneath trend. "
"11094820","11095840"," You poke your head down here."
"11097440","11101640"," Big thing for sellers here is definitely going to be to close under here."
"11103500","11105280"," Try to get this removed. "
"11106580","11107280"," This demand."
"11107740","11110520"," The only thing that I can see you getting that demand removed would be dirt from pile."
"11111220","11112400"," The senate hearing. "
"11113720","11116540"," There are three big things for sellers here."
"11117760","11123940"," It's going to be closing underneath 438 to 439ish."
"11124860","11128680"," This whole area here sellers want to close under it today. "
"11129160","11131320"," A big important thing for sellers to be closing under here."
"11132120","11133240"," You get that to sell the news."
"11134160","11138220"," Sellers are also likely going to say something like, yeah, as the day moves forward. "
"11139240","11142800"," You get news stories saying some shit like, traders are waiting."
"11143900","11144760"," Traders are waiting."
"11147720","11150140"," Traders, it's so stupid how they write this shit. "
"11151560","11154100"," You know, traders await your own pile."
"11157300","11159720"," The trader's bracing for Jerome Powell."
"11160000","11160960"," What a fuck that story is. "
"11162760","11167460"," Sell side though probably wants to be selling the clothes on this hourly."
"11168280","11170200"," Or even up in here believe it or not."
"11171640","11174480"," For, you know, you get squeezed out for that Jerome trade. "
"11174820","11175980"," Two days of down."
"11178760","11180520"," But sellers are still in a good position."
"11180720","11181800"," They're not in a bad position here. "
"11181960","11182140"," They're good."
"11182980","11184560"," I'd say sellers are still in charge."
"11186080","11193600"," Still their market and they're probably looking for a place to put a shirt on for Thursday. "
"11194740","11196840"," How much are puts for Friday?"
"11202840","11203360"," Third."
"11205380","11208180"," Let's see if we get some volatility what it would look like."
"11208340","11213280"," Where would be where would we be looking for a target?"
"11214640","11219300"," I'm gonna go with Kevin Jim James Price target down here on Friday. "
"11219300","11222620"," I got Tuesday, Thursday."
"11223340","11225420"," Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"11227160","11227920"," Down there. "
"11230690","11232070"," Kind of right down in there."
"11232850","11236330"," Let's see if we can actually target this."
"11236670","11237390"," We can draw this out. "
"11238250","11239890"," Hopefully it won't show up on anything."
"11243470","11245050"," Explosive move to the upside."
"11247090","11248310"," Jerome Powell right there. "
"11250930","11252730"," Let's see it off on the opening bell."
"11255850","11258110"," Fucking demand goes down here, right?"
"11260230","11263530"," Jerome Powell fucking right there in a Friday."
"11263770","11264330"," Something like that. "
"11265990","11267850"," Oh, come on here."
"11269070","11269770"," Press enter to finish."
"11270190","11270590"," Throw that away. "
"11274700","11285030"," Dude, yes, that's"
"11285030","11285450"," what they want."
"11291970","11293370"," Maybe that's it down there."
"11300960","11302460"," Maybe that's what Salah's looking for. "
"11302520","11303140"," Something like that."
"11305860","11309860"," One day, two days, three days for, as they expect, then four fucking down days."
"11310140","11310620"," Pretty big day. "
"11315010","11316670"," I'm assuming that's what a seller wants."
"11317350","11318510"," Maybe they want to do it all tomorrow."
"11320770","11322530"," Are they not counting that as a day?"
"11322710","11323070"," They're gonna count. "
"11323230","11324450"," This is one day, one day."
"11325350","11326990"," Two days, three days."
"11327210","11328670"," That's your three down days right there. "
"11333050","11334550"," Squeeze that shit up on Friday."
"11336310","11340150"," Feel that nice little fucking, something like that."
"11340550","11341750"," I'm assuming that's what they're looking for. "
"11346630","11348430"," I don't know what gets you this on Thursday."
"11348850","11350490"," I guess it has to be something inside that meeting."
"11352990","11353950"," Something like that. "
"11367600","11369980"," I'm gonna try to buy some puts here for Friday."
"11375280","11376300"," I'll let you know."
"11377600","11379980"," I'm gonna grab some puts here at some point today. "
"11380720","11382040"," I don't think we're quite ripe yet."
"11382480","11385760"," If we start to roll, sure, maybe they think it's happening sooner."
"11386760","11388740"," We're gonna get the JPM caller out of the way. "
"11388860","11392840"," We're gonna get the gap out of the way, bounce, and then I guess maybe sellers think that."
"11392840","11393700"," I can see that."
"11395740","11396520"," I get that. "
"11396880","11397560"," I see one minute."

"11434830","11437910"," I'm gonna assume that's what sellers are doing right now."
"11443810","11447190"," I guess you could do third short up at the trend. "
"11471170","11473150"," Yeah, they're gonna try to sell this fucking thing down."

"11491690","11492630"," That was a seller. "
"11492830","11493490"," That's what I'd be selling."
"11493930","11495810"," We sell them this one and sell them that one."
"11496830","11499350"," We revenge trading the whole entire thing to the downside. "

"11581590","11583370"," Price target two, price target one."
"11592880","11594220"," Yeah, I think they get run over."
"11597280","11599840"," I think it's like if I was a sell side. "
"11601260","11603300"," If I was sell side I would attempt to sell."
"11604960","11607440"," If I was sell side I would attempt to sell this."
"11609060","11612640"," Then I would have stops above here of course right here. "
"11613120","11614120"," I get run over."
"11615200","11617900"," Squeeze up higher and they'll take another attempt at it right here."
"11619220","11620560"," They're gonna try to sell. "
"11622560","11624900"," We know we have all coming."
"11627360","11629840"," Dealers likely on the sides of buyers though."
"11631080","11632060"," On the options. "
"11634960","11636280"," I think it's to the upside."
"11638180","11639500"," I don't think that they win this."
"11640240","11643680"," I think they're going to step in and be like go fuck yourself. "
"11651410","11655890"," But I can see the want to do that."
"11656070","11659550"," I'm trying to picture myself on sell side."
"11659730","11660770"," Like what do I want to do?"
"11661630","11665990"," If you just open up the chart a little bit they're probably out there going to slam the sell"
"11665990","11666330"," button. "
"11666330","11667630"," Slam the sell button."
"11667930","11668890"," Slam the sell button."

"11685180","11687840"," What I explained volume bars on what chart?"
"11688100","11690380"," So this is a weebel chart."
"11691200","11698000"," I have it on a five minute and I do have extended hours showing the extended hours so maybe that"
"11698000","11698880"," would make a difference."
"11699060","11699420"," I'm not sure. "
"11710690","11712030"," They're trying right now."
"11712190","11712930"," They're gonna attempt this."
"11713350","11714870"," Like they're gonna revenge the fuck out of this. "
"11719020","11720460"," On what chart Ian trades?"

"13577930","13584430"," that line of tech tip stuff came out a whole bunch of other youtubers started fighting with each"
"13584430","13590650"," other because you found out that the skirt was lifted off of a bunch of youtubers they pay for"
"13590650","13596270"," views you can you can pay for them and a lot of people do pay for them like a lot"
"13596270","13603050"," of people what are your favorite youtubers and what's fascinating is they pay for views in the"

"13609290","13615890"," want to hear some fascinating shit they know some really neat shit so what would happen this is how"
"13615890","13618150"," you do it if you guys ever want to know how to do this in your own you want to"
"13618150","13624350"," have your own youtube channel say how to do it so what you do is in the beginning you start"
"13624350","13632450"," by buying views thousands of them like 20 30 40 50 thousand 70 thousand until you grow a natural"
"13632450","13639630"," audience and how you do that is someone will see you with somebody will see you with 60,000 views"
"13639630","13646850"," and say that person must be an authority on this now the beginning you're getting the ad dollars"
"13646850","13653070"," from youtube so you're like ooh I'm making money right and once they finally catch up to you and"
"13653070","13658070"," demonetize you because they will eventually catch you and then they demonetize you you actually"
"13658070","13663150"," don't care because you're making your money your real money at that point off of other things"
"13663150","13670290"," selling a service Amazon fucking links you fucking name it donations doesn't matter so it's like it"
"13670290","13674470"," helps you to get where you need to be and you're able to make money somewhere else by the time"
"13674470","13678810"," youtube catches up it doesn't matter to you at that point if you get demonetized or if your old"
"13678810","13684590"," videos get demonetized because you've already established trust with your audience grown in"
"13684590","13691130"," audience and it's really wild because people watch shit that has a lot of views if you see someone"
"13691130","13697830"," with like 30,000 60,000 this isn't all youtubers but there's a giant percentage of them that you"

"16335860","16342520"," to you there is an aspect to this market right now follow my cursor right here where if we begin"
"16342520","16349640"," to hold the hourly trigger like we go above it and check it and the one in five follow we"
"16349640","16357600"," will follow a rationality up so I think we sell this up here personally but if we don't and we"
"16357600","16363480"," like like so here's the early trigger right here if we actually go up here and like trade this up"
"16363960","16372680"," and then confirm the move is higher like that we have to chase it and it can stay irrational for"
"16372680","16382340"," weeks it's insane so that's the other side of this coin here right is how irrational"
"16382340","16389360"," can we stay we just trade the fucking hourly for the next month you know do you not get your"
"16389360","16401200"," weakness into the end of the month and"

"16413000","16421500"," talking about that and I was saying you know if you are going to have some downside expectations"
"16422000","16427840"," something you can't have them I think they are reasonable to have you're like hey we're going to"
"16427840","16431080"," pull back here we're going to go to the data we're going to weekly that kind of stuff I think"
"16431080","16438240"," you can have those expectations I don't think that's irrational I think though that even myself"
"16438240","16446680"," tell me if you believe this or not so do you believe I feel like right where we are this"
"16446680","16454400"," is another thing that's in my mind that dude I chewed on this at late night we're like the damage"
"16454400","16464360"," done to the psyche from December 2020 to right now maybe even the 2020 crash I guess maybe it's"
"16464360","16471580"," all of it 2020 to hear and people talk about 2000 and 2008 but for me personally like relative to"
"16471580","16481540"," where we are right now it's almost like 2022 or 2022 yeah 2022 like trained me"

"17133860","17136200"," They weren't talking about it, but I was trading it. "
"17136680","17140240"," We were buying 800,000 puts a day and it was going straight to the depths of hell."

"17150320","17151800"," So they just didn't talk about it."
"17152200","17155240"," It's like the argument out there that it's all these call buyers bullshit."
"17156080","17157220"," They were running that shit. "
"17157700","17158720"," These aren't retailers."
"17159080","17160820"," These are HFTs doing this shit."
"17161480","17163120"," And they were doing it last year too. "
"17163880","17166160"," Dealers are doing it more than likely doing it quietly."
"17166860","17167980"," Like tell you they're not what they are."
"17169140","17171480"," There's a whole bunch of people out there that are doing it. "
"17171960","17173600"," And the retailers aren't the major offenders."
"17175140","17177060"," Like they like people like to sell you."
"17177800","17181520"," And they also don't like to talk about people don't like to say that we were doing this last year,"
"17181640","17184440"," the put buying at scale. "
"17185040","17187540"," Like big, big, big zero day puts."
"17189480","17192480"," Not as much as the calls this year, but not much lower."
"17194660","17200080"," There are some big days, big moving days, 800,000, 800,000 zero day puts rolling. "
"17201700","17203800"," And we were watching them in real time as they were happening."
"17203900","17204380"," It was insane."
"17213870","17215670"," Come on, baby, sell it down. "
"17218490","17220030"," Vicks grinding lower still."
"17223430","17224990"," IWM looking kind of bearish."
"17225890","17227570"," Tesla's sitting on its 27 EMA. "
"17229770","17232050"," No sell side position for me as of yet."
"17232350","17233290"," Too risky for my blood."
"17234430","17236790"," I would love to catch this close up here. "
"17237870","17239170"," I can catch this one right here."
"17240170","17243110"," I already showed you a put spread for tomorrow."
"17243730","17248310"," I'm assuming that these sellers here are hoping that there's some natural selling. "
"17248930","17251870"," They're going to try for natural selling."
"17252010","17254630"," I don't want to be long for Jerome Powell."
"17255750","17260370"," I'm going to hedge the market here and wait until natural selling occurs on my side. "
"17262250","17264150"," For me, I'm looking for this up here."
"17264870","17266790"," I'd like to get some puts up here for Thursday."
"17273810","17275530"," Vicks still grinding lower. "
"17275630","17276810"," Vicks trading $14."
"17279370","17281910"," There is now a hedge on the market."
"17282530","17283350"," They don't care. "
"17288240","17291480"," They don't care about the price of the market."
"17293300","17295800"," They don't care about the price of the underlying."
"17296160","17297400"," They're going to hedge the fuck out of it. "
"17310750","17312310"," No, my Vicks state is good."
"17317570","17318970"," My Vicks state is fine."
"17321590","17342150"," Vicks now trading $13.99. I"
"17342150","17344030"," got an exact price right here. "
"17344570","17346310"," I'm going to show it to you in two ways I can."
"17347290","17351990"," Vicks currently at this moment is trading now."
"17354910","17359930"," Now it's trading $14 flat on a one minute. "
"17360130","17361390"," Oh, that's one day chart, my bad."
"17361970","17362970"," Yeah, one minute chart."
"17363210","17368150"," One minute chart was trading $13.99. Now it's trading $14. "
"17374950","17376030"," Trust me, I got it right."
"17385050","17386350"," Go to a weeb old chart."
"17390640","17391620"," Go to the one minute. "
"17397880","17405840"," Yeah, I got $14.03 right now on a trading view, which doesn't have a ton of data on it."
"17409600","17413900"," You guys understand the concept of more than one exchange reporting the price."
"17415140","17419060"," So I don't know what you're looking at, where you're getting your data. "
"17424020","17435970"," Vicks now squeezing trading $14.03. Did"
"17435970","17438770"," I say I bet the space that aliens are long Bitcoin?"
"17449430","17450390"," Oh, baby."
"17452010","17453130"," Let's see if we can."
"17454310","17456190"," Oh, I'm going to go do something right now. "
"17575950","17578930"," You guys want to see me ship post on Fintuit right now?"
"17579310","17589490"," I did"
"17607190","17607830"," that one twice."
"17687540","17688580"," What's the Vicks doing?"
"17689420","17690820"," The Vicks okay down there?"
"17729730","17730790"," Trade the trigger."
"17731330","17732350"," Not a bad handle. "
"17733610","17735090"," Not too shabby of a handle."
"17873790","17875210"," I don't know what's happening here."
"17875250","17877150"," These fucking sellers, man, these guys are crazy. "
"17877850","17879050"," I'm watching this right now."
"17879110","17881610"," I'm like, there's like a there's like a fund right now."
"17881630","17883770"," He's like, just slam the sell button. "
"17884850","17885790"," They're going to give it up."
"17885910","17887710"," There's no way they're going to stay long into this close."
"17896790","17898190"," They just don't give a fuck. "
"17898310","17899050"," This is a market hedge."
"17899190","17900030"," You guys know that, right?"
"17900210","17901470"," This is a market hedge right here."
"17903870","17905110"," Big fat fucking hedge. "
"17905230","17906150"," They don't care about you."
"17909750","17915250"," There's like a there's like a sweaty boiler room somewhere and there's like a bunch of like, well,"
"17915630","17916590"," cubicles that they're changed."
"17916810","17917670"," They don't look like that anymore. "
"17918570","17919810"," Now they're like cubicles."
"17919990","17921990"," You get like a four foot by four foot cubicle."
"17922170","17923870"," There's a fucking Wrangler walking around. "
"17924930","17926810"," It's like, Bob, what are you doing over there?"
"17926950","17927850"," Mike, what's going on?"
"17929450","17930770"," I got the hedge on, sir."
"17944450","17945770"," He's saying steak for clothes."
"17945990","17946410"," What does that mean?"
"17946610","17946950"," What does steak?"
"17947170","17949370"," I don't know a lot of like, I know wifey, but I don't know. "
"17949750","17951490"," I'm not indoctrinated in wifey."
"17952670","17954130"," So I don't know what that means."
"17954770","17956750"," I honestly, I never followed him. "
"17956830","17959370"," I just started following him like a month ago or something like that."
"17959370","17967040"," Oh, so steak is red day veggies for green."
"17967760","17968280"," Got it. "
"17968660","17971740"," Yeah, it makes, I mean, it makes sense in terms of, I know what they're doing."
"17973220","17973980"," They're trying."
"17973980","17979320"," Oh, there's a, there are hedge funds that are fucking heads to the tits right here and they just"
"17979320","17980140"," don't give a fuck. "
"17980220","17981560"," They're going to hedge it until you sell."
"17982680","17986560"," They're going to hedge on the belief that people are going to wrap it up for tomorrow."
"17986900","17987820"," I mean, I see it coming. "
"17989340","17991940"," But, you know, just going to squeeze them one more time up here."
"17992240","17994540"," Then we'll give them the right clothes they want."
"17999700","18001280"," I like that red read down reference. "
"18001540","18002640"," That's a good analogy."
"18003000","18003320"," I like it."
"18004840","18006700"," Like it's now, now I learned something. "
"18007260","18010760"," Steak for, or steak is down and veggies for, uh, for green right now."
"18010800","18011080"," That's good."
"18012020","18012360"," I dig it. "
"18015000","18015900"," I dig it."
"18016040","18016280"," It's cool."
"18020870","18028250"," Yeah, I don't, um, I, uh, I try to, a lot of the people that I pay attention to out"
"18028250","18030730"," there are serious day traders. "
"18031250","18031950"," I'll be honest with you."
"18032710","18035010"," Those are the, I pay attention to serious day traders."
"18037750","18039150"," They've saved my fucking life. "
"18040230","18047690"," I used to do like, um, I used to do a lot of like, uh, like a conviction type stuff"
"18047690","18050250"," like, uh, I got a conviction here."
"18050330","18050870"," It's going to happen."
"18051690","18055690"," And then when I once I learned how to, what, like, like a start out, right?"
"18055810","18059150"," Like, or I started out as like a, um, a bull, stupid fucking bull. "
"18060110","18061870"," Uh, then I became a bear."
"18062970","18064230"," Because I learned too much."
"18064850","18066090"," And then I was like, this is all gross. "
"18066990","18071010"," Uh, then I became a conviction trade, I was a conviction trader for bulls."
"18071670","18073350"," Then a conviction trader for bears."
"18074590","18076650"," And then I learned about day traders. "
"18078710","18080330"," And that was it for me."
"18081010","18082770"," I was like, fuck all that noise."
"18084170","18086310"," And day traders are like, I'll take this shit anywhere. "
"18086530","18086750"," It's going."
"18086910","18087210"," I don't care."
"18087530","18088430"," They're like whore masters. "
"18092250","18093690"," They're straight whore masters."
"18094030","18096290"," They're just like, they will whore themselves out."
"18096470","18098750"," They will fucking, they will flip on a dime. "
"18098750","18103170"," And I noticed that we do a blend of all of that together."
"18106050","18109270"," Like all the, all the stages of, of trading and investing."
"18110590","18113150"," Then you like, you realize people's motivations. "
"18113950","18115870"," They have all kinds of different motivations."
"18117570","18121250"," And, uh, the day trade is the ones that saved my life."
"18121470","18122310"," I had to, I had to say that. "
"18126200","18131760"," Like, well, there's two, two, the two main educations I got was the first one that I got was from,"
"18132060","18133760"," uh, professionals."
"18134280","18135260"," I got professional education."
"18136360","18141460"," And, um, my second education was fucking day traders that just don't give a fuck. "
"18142560","18145460"," They'll fucking sell their fucking father, mother, brother, sister."
"18145640","18146000"," They don't care."
"18148600","18150760"," They'll fucking buy their mother, brother, father, seller. "
"18151060","18151580"," So it's not fun."
"18152700","18154920"," Getting over that was a big, probably the biggest thing."
"18156100","18159160"," Like to not be a conviction trader was like a huge milestone. "
"18172220","18176380"," See now, like if day traders like we're selling this shit, I'm like, where right now let's do it."
"18176620","18180080"," I'm like, I'm like, full fucking turn the fucking wheel."
"18180260","18180960"," We're going the other way. "
"18182340","18183180"," Fuck my conviction."
"18184640","18186120"," They used to do all kinds of research."
"18186120","18190620"," I used to do like fundamental technical fucking market profile. "
"18190720","18194120"," I mean, still do some of that stuff, but still do."
"18194300","18197640"," I have some parts of traditional like, here's the fucking trend line."
"18197880","18202880"," I'll do that, but it's like, it's like the end result at the end of the day is. "
"18203140","18207840"," Oh shit, we're selling or oh shit, we're buying and I'll fucking throw all that out the window."
"18208200","18209500"," Price action king."
"18218480","18221880"," Now, if you're trying to learn price action and technical analysis, I'll tell you this. "
"18223820","18226200"," There's a few people in there I'm going to recommend."
"18226500","18227800"," Number one, get with Winky."
"18228680","18230460"," He has a Winky's unicorn channel. "
"18230660","18231120"," Get in there."
"18231740","18232380"," Raise your hand."
"18232860","18234520"," The second one that I would say is find John L."
"18236380","18237640"," John L is his name. "
"18237800","18238720"," I think he's an admin now."
"18239320","18239980"," Find him."
"18241240","18244840"," And then I would find David AMS. I think he's traveling home right now."
"18245580","18248120"," So he's not there currently, but find those three people."
"18250060","18251460"," And they will help you. "
"18253480","18254140"," They will."
"18254260","18256220"," If I had those three in my side, it'd be."
"18259120","18261000"," That's the complete package right there, I think. "
"18261700","18264720"," There's probably more in there, like a ton more, but like those three guys."
"18264920","18267300"," If I was to learn from three people, probably those guys right now."
"18269800","18273580"," I'm sure there's a better traders in there or as good traders in there as them. "
"18273880","18277760"," But Winky has a way of bottom where he can teach people."
"18278720","18282400"," And then I see John L has a depth of knowledge."
"18283840","18285940"," David AMS is cold and collected. "
"18290330","18291530"," So find those three guys."
"18291830","18292930"," David AMS. Go find him. "
"18293090","18294590"," He's in the futures channel."
"18295050","18295930"," You don't have to trade futures."
"18296730","18299410"," Just get in there and he's going to show you where the supply and demand is. "
"18300010","18302770"," John L is going to teach you the mechanics of the market."
"18303070","18306810"," The fundamentals would most likely be Winky."
"18307930","18310590"," Technical analysis, traditional technical analysis. "
"18311130","18318810"," I mean, Winky's got some insight that can't be beat."
"18319870","18323010"," He has a really good eye for when to sell the market."
"18323710","18325770"," Is a really good eye for when to buy the market. "
"18327010","18332710"," He's one of the winky to me is I want you to know that winky to me is one of"
"18332710","18333530"," the guys that."
"18334530","18339310"," Like we're when we're burning him and I are talking very cool and calm about it."
"18339710","18341690"," When we're topping, we're exiting together. "
"18343790","18348450"," Quite frequently, not always, but you know, generally we're starting to be like, Hey, what do you"
"18348450","18348850"," think of this?"
"18349130","18349670"," What do you think of that?"
"18351250","18352590"," You want to meet those people."
"18354490","18357530"," You want to meet the people that when we're selling, they're selling when we're buying and they're"
"18357530","18357790"," buying."
"18358990","18360370"," You don't know what's going to happen. "
"18360370","18361190"," Find those people."
"18361290","18361630"," It's important."
"18362970","18367530"," They'll be the voice of reason on tops and bottoms sideways days, all that kind of stuff. "
"18376610","18378290"," John L, I think he's an admin."
"18379610","18381230"," I shouldn't say think he is."
"18381910","18383890"," And then David AMS, he's a moderator. "
"18385530","18386310"," And Winky, he's an admin."
"18387630","18388370"," Find those guys."
"18389010","18389750"," Guys knows what's up. "
"18389950","18390310"," You know what they're doing."
"18390830","18392170"," There are others in there that do as well."
"18392750","18395430"," You can ask people and they're saying, Hey, I'm interested in fundamental. "
"18396030","18399990"," You just ask just going to after the after we close today, right?"
"18400650","18403270"," Go in the general chat and ask ask the members."
"18403610","18405670"," I'm giving you recommendations, but I'll be honest with you."
"18406190","18407390"," I'll be a hundred percent honest with you. "
"18408550","18411950"," You guys make up that discord, even if you're brand new."
"18413070","18414590"," So you can just go into the discord."
"18414830","18415670"," Don't take my recommendation. "
"18416150","18417190"," I shouldn't be saying this stuff."
"18417790","18418550"," Like, Hey, it's Winky."
"18418810","18419230"," It's this guy. "
"18419310","18420530"," It's that guy because I'll be honest with you."
"18421130","18423150"," There's some people in there that trade all fucking day long."
"18423150","18425450"," They more than likely know better than I do. "
"18426030","18429550"," And not only that, you guys have to make that those decisions, right?"
"18430070","18431510"," You guys can fade me all you want."
"18432250","18435550"," You guys, I don't expect you guys to just be following."
"18435790","18436510"," I'm not that guy. "
"18436710","18437210"," I'm not that leader."
"18437730","18440990"," I'm not a leader that's like it's my way or the highway."
"18442070","18443130"," I'm not that person. "
"18443650","18444030"," So."
"18445970","18450870"," If you just go in the discord and just ask inside the general chatter, go to the trading room floor"
"18450870","18455630"," and say, I'm looking for fundamental and technical analysis and you point me in the right"
"18455630","18456110"," direction."
"18456530","18459430"," And those guys don't have to say the guys that I said in any way shape or form. "
"18459550","18461250"," That means nothing to me."
"18462190","18464130"," That's just been my experience with those guys."
"18465810","18467990"," And I'm not the end all sale on that discord. "
"18468690","18471150"," So I probably shouldn't have even mentioned those guys names."
"18479300","18483120"," There's some gangster fucking traders in there and I didn't mention their names and I should have."
"18483120","18483540"," So. "
"18485000","18489780"," You know, that's a disservice to a lot of great traders and teachers in there."
"18490960","18492220"," It's up for you guys, the community."
"18492300","18494060"," You guys have to be like, hey, these guys are great. "
"18494460","18497920"," You know, are these guys are okay or hey, you can trade with us and we're following these guys."
"18498420","18499260"," Something like that."
"18513240","18514620"," Yeah, they're a saint. "
"18515220","18515780"," They will."

"18537840","18540000"," Bloodbath and VIX market hedges on spy."
"18540460","18541140"," Sellers don't care. "
"18541320","18542860"," They're going to get their revenge one way or another."
"18543900","18544880"," They're looking for it."
"18545000","18545380"," They don't care. "
"18546340","18548400"," So if you're going to take a put spread, maybe you take it."
"18549720","18551260"," Because one way or another, they're going to get it."
"18553500","18554700"," Or they're asking for it. "
"18554820","18555820"," I'm not in one right now."
"18555840","18557100"," I'm still waiting until the end of the day."
"18557100","18559960"," I feel like I'm playing poker right now. "
"18561280","18562780"," I don't fucking believe them here."
"18563200","18563920"," I think they're lying."
"18566260","18570540"," I feel like I'm in a poker game and I'm waiting for that last card drop and I'm looking for"
"18570540","18570840"," that ace. "
"18574360","18575760"," I think that ace is at the close."
"18575960","18576620"," I could be wrong here."
"18586130","18587330"," What's going on in the discord?"
"18588150","18591350"," Is there, are we getting the bot runs in there right now?"
"18593230","18594070"," Flop the nuts. "
"18598790","18600570"," I know there's a hedge here."
"18601070","18604710"," If you're a seller, I know what you're doing."
"18605470","18606710"," You got a market hedge on. "
"18607690","18611630"," You want that sweet, sweet vol from J-POW and friends."

"18620670","18621650"," Patience in the market. "
"18627610","18631030"," Yeah, I got to do a, I have to start making."
"18631430","18632970"," So I've got a white paper that I've been writing."
"18633250","18634770"," I've got a big white paper that I'm writing. "
"18635030","18639350"," So I'm hoping that when the beta tool is supposed to be ready right now."
"18639350","18642590"," So like right fucking now, like two days ago."
"18642930","18644970"," So supposedly it's 90% done. "
"18646190","18647950"," My plan and hope here."
"18649070","18655730"," The coming days is to release the beta tool to you and start recording videos with you."
"18657130","18659930"," They're training from zero to ten, right?"
"18660110","18662910"," Like we're going to start here and look at this and look at these examples. "
"18663550","18665550"," We're going to work through all these things together."
"18666730","18672770"," And what we're going to do is we'll have that small video series and it'll go inside the discord"
"18672770","18674790"," for you guys."
"18674910","18676430"," So you get a crash course. "
"18676830","18677810"," What is he talking about?"
"18678470","18680210"," What is a recheck?"
"18680350","18681150"," What is a kiss?"
"18681470","18683690"," What is a bull plane on this timeframe?"
"18684090","18686930"," Why is he checking day, hour, fifteen, five, and one?"
"18687110","18687810"," Why is he doing this?"
"18688530","18690070"," How does this set itself up?"
"18690270","18691750"," Where's the high probability trade and all these things?"
"18691750","18692890"," So all those things."
"18693110","18697030"," So if you're new, you should at least be able to watch like a couple hours of videos."
"18697570","18701870"," Come back tomorrow if you're new to the channel and new to us and you can say alright, at least"
"18701870","18703030"," get what they're talking about. "
"18706490","18709410"," So we are seeing this resolution to the downside here."
"18710010","18712490"," We are watching this grind take place in here, right?"
"18712730","18713250"," See this right here?"
"18713370","18713930"," No man's land."
"18714630","18716810"," Up, down, up, down, up, down. "
"18717290","18723050"," I was telling you earlier, you want to see a red bar underneath the white line and some rejection."
"18723570","18724770"," So we're going to look at that right now."
"18725170","18726270"," They're trying right now. "
"18726350","18730070"," They're getting a little bit of a bear, a little bit of a bear cross right here."
"18730130","18730470"," You see it?"
"18731350","18733290"," If you can't see, I'll show it to you right now."
"18733970","18735530"," A little bit of a bear cross starting to form. "
"18736550","18739930"," So rather than waiting around and all this, what am I looking for here?"
"18740050","18744490"," If I'm going to take a put right here, they have the first green bar underneath right here."
"18746170","18748910"," And you've got the formings right here of this yellow."
"18750190","18751710"," Right here, it's resolving to the downside. "
"18752050","18753490"," I haven't gotten caught in any calls yet."
"18754290","18755310"," So do you see that right there?"
"18755930","18759650"," So what they're going to try to do is you're going to get a red bar, right?"
"18759990","18761570"," Those are where the sellers are going to step in here."
"18761570","18762670"," They're going to take this red bar. "
"18763970","18768970"," And you want to see like a green rejection right here."
"18770210","18771830"," And then set up the trade."
"18772090","18773250"," Don't execute it yet. "
"18773810","18774870"," Right here."
"18775690","18778070"," That next bar, like one, two, and three."
"18778810","18780970"," And then you'll get some continuation of the downside here. "
"18785460","18787180"," I'm going to keep my eye on this bar."
"18787800","18789580"," I've got this nice and open right here."
"18789640","18791060"," I'm watching it pay attention to it. "
"18791580","18792860"," It's watching unfold right now."
"18793760","18794860"," You see the cross right here?"
"18795780","18796680"," There's your cross forming."
"18797480","18798260"," You see it?"
"18798600","18799020"," It's right there. "
"18802800","18803600"," Right there."
"18803780","18804820"," You can't see it."
"18804860","18805320"," It's right there. "
"18813740","18816380"," I'm going to look for some Friday puts."
"18816840","18818160"," I don't know if I should take them now."
"18820720","18821520"," Thursday puts. "
"18823360","18824180"," Wait a second."
"18832730","18834190"," Here, I'll show it to you in a better way."
"18839410","18840290"," They're right there. "
"18846840","18847560"," Show it to you in one minute."
"18848140","18848960"," See, you can see it."
"18848960","18849980"," It's right here. "
"18850380","18851260"," One minute chart."
"18854780","18856340"," And you see this cross right here?"
"18856620","18857380"," I'll show it to you right here."
"18859360","18860660"," There's the red and white crossing. "
"18861360","18864960"," You get the red down and you're going to look for a rejection right here."
"18865700","18866580"," See that green candle?"
"18867740","18871640"," If there's a rejection right here and you get one more red bar right down here?"
"18872660","18873900"," Now we should be good to go to the downside."
"18876680","18877720"," There's a one minute chart. "
"18877920","18878800"," I'll show it to you right now."
"18879320","18880680"," You're still not in puts here."
"18881040","18886240"," It's like red bar, red bar underneath, cross, and you're looking for that one green candle up here"
"18886240","18887440"," for that rejection. "
"18888460","18889740"," So right here, we'll show it to you."
"18890480","18891320"," There's a five minute chart."
"18892640","18893560"," There's your red candle. "
"18894000","18894820"," Here's your green candle."
"18895160","18897120"," You're looking to see what the reaction is here."
"18897680","18902120"," If buyers have no will to go higher here, here's your red bar right here. "
"18909630","18912030"," Looking at June 22nd."

"20515650","20516550"," I'll say this."
"20517430","20518530"," So on zoom. "
"20520050","20522570"," Let me see if I can do a thirty minute here and take a closer look."

"20525810","20528630"," You are getting an explosive move to the upside. "
"20529950","20531270"," It's a little long in the tooth."
"20534430","20538230"," But what I would say to you on zoom is keep buying the dips."
"20539010","20541130"," The next dip for you to buy is sixty eight forty. "
"20542130","20543450"," It's going to get violent."
"20544730","20547150"," It's going to go up but be violent."

"20551530","20552890"," What kind of options."
"20553170","20553490"," What stock."
"20553910","20555250"," What are you bearish. "
"20555410","20556810"," I'm bullish on zoom so."
"20564750","20566650"," First thing I want you to tell me is ZM."
"20567690","20568650"," Are you long short. "
"20570010","20572350"," What are you long and short in when did you enter."
"20573090","20573830"," What's your expectations."
"20574770","20575910"," Whatever you can tell me the better. "
"20576930","20578110"," Then we'll talk about zoom."
"20585440","20586560"," You're waiting for entry."
"20586960","20588300"," You don't have to. "
"20590320","20591500"," Well, I shouldn't say that."
"20591680","20592560"," Not financial advice."
"20594140","20595540"," Well, it could get sold down. "
"20595680","20596020"," We'll look at it."
"20596140","20597560"," If you're not in entry right now, hold on."
"20597620","20598240"," We'll look at it right now. "
"20603230","20604870"," I shouldn't say that you don't have to."
"20605750","20606770"," You get paranoid."
"20609650","20610950"," It's a little long in the tooth. "
"20613730","20614490"," At the moment."
"20615330","20617510"," But the expectation is zoom thirty minute chart."
"20621230","20623270"," Personally, I'd like to buy still by. "
"20625670","20626550"," Like today."
"20628170","20632150"," I'd rather be buying like something like that or something like this down here."
"20636030","20637730"," But I'm extremely bullish here. "
"20638730","20640870"," I like that it is already."
"20641690","20643450"," There's one more thing to put here."
"20645770","20648350"," Sixty one fifty nine sixty seven and seventy. "
"20649270","20651250"," They can begin to squeeze here."
"20651510","20654830"," There's a second trade here as I point the first trade for you."
"20654830","20655830"," If you're not already in it. "
"20655950","20658690"," Your first trade is sixty nine forty."
"20660090","20661110"," Sixty nine twenty."
"20662330","20663210"," But I will say this. "
"20665370","20668090"," Due to market conditions, you could possibly be buying."
"20673130","20674830"," Something over here like this."
"20677570","20679970"," I'd really like to buy like sixty three dollars. "
"20680250","20682350"," No, I know that doesn't seem like it's going to happen."
"20683170","20685290"," Like you're going to see these prices be able to buy."
"20687470","20689210"," I will show you this here. "
"20689610","20693330"," You have your first attempt to break through weekly smashed right down."
"20693810","20698590"," So if we're right here right now again and you say to me that can't happen, I can assure you"
"20698590","20699110"," that it can."
"20700430","20704110"," It can actually happen and you buy that dip once more for the break above. "
"20704110","20706550"," There's a chance here that zoom is going to take some time."
"20707110","20709590"," Like a consolidation trade to the upside over time."
"20709690","20710510"," So just be aware of that. "
"20711270","20713630"," But there is another trade for you to the upside."
"20713630","20717390"," Some closing balance still sitting at twenty four million to the south side."
"20717570","20719490"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick. "
"20719830","20723790"," Your best trade on this to go up is to wait for."
"20725110","20726250"," They'll just draw it out."
"20728570","20730790"," It's like not get caught in the FOMO. "
"20731850","20736350"," Let it come down here and consolidate for the move higher."
"20738050","20739690"," And this would be your buy."
"20740670","20742610"," This is the safer buy if it holds. "
"20743390","20745070"," So it'd be somewhere like right here."
"20748110","20751790"," So you'd like wait for the wait for the confirmation that we're bullish."
"20752830","20754210"," Wait for the recheck. "
"20755530","20757210"," We'll probably check once or twice."
"20757890","20759430"," And then you get your move to the upside."
"20761070","20763170"," So this is like the safer trade here. "
"20763910","20766070"," If you haven't bought any of this or heading up."
"20766590","20770950"," And the other aspect to this is if due to market conditions at any point."
"20772070","20774930"," There's more of like a there's more of like a."
"20775890","20778750"," Hey, I'm a day trading trade day trading this shit. "
"20778890","20780570"," I get that some of you are like cats up here."
"20781270","20782350"," I get what you're saying."
"20785070","20788150"," But if any moments like you want to be a buyer down here. "
"20788150","20789910"," You'll put risk on when there's risk to be taken."
"20790070","20792550"," You want to take the risk off when the when the pay is there."
"20792690","20792810"," Okay. "
"20793310","20795910"," If we were to go up here and squeeze up higher like this one did."

"20797690","20798830"," So just in here. "

"20804630","20805550"," I'm going to give you a number here."
"20808590","20811690"," Do this market looks like it wants the fucking fuck to the upside."
"20811910","20812650"," I'm not lying here. "
"20814210","20816810"," I'm bullish anything above 71 50 on zoom."
"20817450","20819150"," This market is so fucking bullish."
"20819410","20821190"," I don't know why people are saying this market looks perish. "
"20821970","20824070"," This market wants to fucking destroy."

"20840290","20840790"," I'm funny."
"20843430","20847630"," This market wants to fucking eat every fucking seller alive."
"20848250","20849210"," Do you think we already ate him?"
"20855250","20858370"," They want to fucking destroy sellers. "
"20860530","20862310"," Fucking eat him alive."

"20882430","20885890"," And I'm like, like zoom wants to fucking just destroy."
"20891310","20892850"," Sellers need to open a prayer."
"20894670","20897710"," They need a big old fucking rug pull for no parent reason. "
"21013020","21017060"," Early marketing closing balance still sitting at 24 million to the south side."
"21024530","21027090"," Well, hedge market goes up, baby."
"21029730","21032250"," Look at that fucking bull flag right there. "
"21034150","21035570"," I'm going to get stopped in this."
"21035690","21036390"," I already can see it."
"21040370","21041190"," No break. "
"21059780","21062300"," Much of zero dates costing right now for calls."
"21062480","21063980"," I'm staying in these puts right now."
"21065020","21066060"," 62 cents. "
"21068000","21072900"," I don't want to buy zero dates here either."

"21122840","21125860"," I'm still in them, but I'm fucking scared as fuck right here."
"21126460","21129500"," They want to rip fucking faces off into this bell."
"21131600","21133460"," Like this shit just wants to go. "
"21133680","21137380"," You can see it right there's a market hedge out of this world right now."

"21163860","21166680"," Right up to your second short right there."
"21179930","21182410"," These sellers don't have shit."
"21186730","21189230"," Well, hedged fucking market goes up. "
"21225450","21228330"," Yeah, it's a giant fucking I'm going to have to get out of this trade."

"21229030","21229690"," They're going to burn them. "
"21234020","21238360"," It's going to be a big fuck your head straight."
"21238400","21239240"," I can already see it."
"21241520","21244120"," Need it like sellers basically need a fucking miracle. "
"21247260","21248060"," All right."
"21260100","21261700"," I got a limit selling here."

"21273280","21275300"," They're going to buy the fuck out of all of it."
"21275880","21277300"," Every last bit of it."
"21277920","21278860"," I'm out right there. "

"21321480","21323040"," They ain't got nothing."
"21323580","21325100"," 11 million to the bar size."
"21325320","21327140"," That's the market on closing balance for today's session. "
"21327420","21328400"," 11 million to buy."
"21332450","21333890"," Sorry, my knees are all fucked up."
"21334450","21337030"," My knees are crazy fucked up right now. "
"21338490","21342150"," These fucking sellers and that the market is so hedged, dude."
"21343730","21345450"," You're going to get fucking hammered."
"21347310","21353710"," You buying fucking puts like fucking 930 in the morning and shit 10 o'clock. "
"21354310","21355290"," Right on the fucking button."
"21357590","21361390"," We're going to run this up and fucking the first 15 minutes of the close too."
"21370290","21372470"," I took a bunch of pills just then when I was off camera. "
"21373030","21377670"," I took a bunch of inflammatory anti-inflammatory pills for my knees."
"21379350","21382030"," I got like, I got all jammed up, water skiing."
"21399860","21401660"," Look at NDX, dude. "
"21401760","21404760"," NDX is going to go back and fucking retest the highs."
"21405560","21406780"," Like, no joking."
"21407380","21408200"," Like NASDAQ. "
"21409740","21410260"," NASDAQ."
"21410540","21414960"," I'm trading above with a bull cross above looking to go back and retest."
"21415600","21417060"," Some fucking highs again. "
"21417420","21420220"," Closing a gap, returning to the seat of the crime at 15, too."
"21420920","21421100"," Woo!"
"21421580","21422360"," NASDAQ, baby!"
"21424400","21426480"," Fuck your market head straight up."
"21437710","21443470"," Like, I'm watching this in the background and I'm like, I'm looking at this shit and I'm like, how"
"21443470","21447190"," do you fucking sell when NASDAQ's breaking right now the way that it is?"
"21448010","21454690"," Even if it pulls back and retests that fucking bull plane on the five, it's going to fuck up every"
"21454690","21455630"," single seller here. "
"21458210","21461430"," IWM, bull plane right on the close right here."
"21462210","21465810"," Tesla, trading 274.50 fucking six."
"21468090","21469790"," Fucking crazy right now. "
"21471970","21476790"," Look at that squeeze right there and a bull plane right here on spy."
"21477670","21480690"," You're going to get run of the fuck over here in this close."
"21485430","21487670"," Stream bullishness in the market right now. "
"21490430","21493070"," Like, look at NASDAQ is just like, I'm out of here."
"21494870","21496450"," You had yourself for tomorrow."
"21496710","21500630"," You got like, there's need like, unknown event of some kind. "
"21501610","21503910"," They need like a surprise 50 BPS."
"21505970","21508230"," I don't know what else they can do right here."
"21510470","21512330"," I kind of feel bad for sellers. "
"21512910","21515510"," Kind of feel bad right here."
"21515670","21516870"," Like they're not going to win this."
"21517190","21517990"," There's no winning this. "
"21518150","21519190"," There's no hedge you can do."
"21519750","21521310"," It's going to explode to the upside."
"21522330","21524310"," They're going to get fucking run over again. "
"21525430","21526510"," That's what it is."
"21536130","21537570"," Yeah, I don't see it, man."
"21537870","21539230"," I'm like, I don't see it at all. "
"21540570","21548610"," I'm looking around and I'm like, like NASDAQ could roll over and slam into 15068 and that's just to"
"21548610","21549790"," confirm a move higher."
"21550950","21555710"," Like there's nothing really here that's showing that I'm looking at that's showing."
"21556770","21558030"," The bearishness, everyone. "
"21558230","21559710"," I mean, maybe it's something that's not seen."
"21562150","21569390"," Tesla cranking in the clothes trading 27473 green bars reaching up, VIX rolling over below with"
"21569390","21570870"," 1395 right now."
"21571750","21574470"," Trying to find something here, Dixie rolling over. "
"21576130","21578350"," Like trying to find something that's bearish here."
"21579950","21581030"," Like, let's look at it."
"21581430","21583250"," Like this stuff is all nonsense right here. "
"21583450","21584570"," I'm going to show you guys something here."
"21585510","21586550"," That shit's all pure nonsense."
"21587090","21591110"," Like no matter what the fuck they're trying to do, this must be a liquidity grab because I'll tell"
"21591110","21591490"," you what. "
"21591970","21593790"," I'm going to show you what NASDAQ here."
"21593910","21594570"," They're trying."
"21594890","21595430"," They're best here. "
"21596230","21598830"," I want to show you a five minute chart on NASDAQ here."
"21598990","21600190"," They don't fucking care."
"21600470","21601610"," And I want to show you something here. "
"21602130","21603990"," I'm going to show you how you get fucking blown out."
"21604130","21604710"," It's right here."
"21605930","21607710"," This fucking thing happens here. "
"21611310","21613130"," This price holds here, right?"
"21613410","21614230"," And this thing goes."
"21615050","21618190"," It's going to be fucking boom time for NASDAQ."
"21620130","21622390"," So they're doing everything they can to sell this. "
"21622630","21623950"," Like the revenge selling this."
"21624810","21626530"," Trying to crash this market here."
"21626670","21627730"," And I don't know why they're doing it. "
"21627970","21629070"," I don't know what their plan is."
"21631550","21632510"," But I don't know, man."
"21632650","21633650"," They need some fucking news. "
"21638030","21639230"," They're trying right here."
"21639790","21641830"," They're even trying on this clothes right here to sell it."
"21642550","21643650"," Flipping it right over right here. "
"21643810","21644770"," Just begging and pleading."
"21645170","21646270"," And it's not going to work for me."
"21646550","21647530"," I don't fucking believe them. "
"21653060","21654200"," You got nothing for sellers."
"21654940","21655780"," You ain't got shit."
"21656820","21659160"," I think Jay Powell is going to fuck your whole week up here. "
"21659480","21660040"," You're a seller."
"21660220","21661200"," I'm not buying this."
"21670100","21672400"," I got nothing for sellers here. "
"21673080","21674500"," I don't believe any of this for a minute."
"21676320","21677800"," They're going to try, try, try."
"21678080","21678520"," But I don't care. "
"21681760","21684480"," They're going to have to try to mechanically bring it down or something."
"21684480","21690500"," The only thing they can think of here that sellers could do is try to do it in futures."
"21690760","21693940"," That's the only place where they can step the market down. "
"21694440","21696320"," They're not stepping down cash market."
"21696880","21697920"," No fucking way."
"21699100","21702940"," So the only thing that I can think of here would be they sell futures. "
"21704520","21705160"," That's it."
"21705520","21706220"," Selling futures."
"21706840","21709500"," Outside of that, they don't have shit in cash market. "
"21716170","21716730"," Oh."
"21720420","21721660"," They don't have shit."
"21722140","21724700"," They're only hope is dealers selling futures. "
"21725100","21725360"," That's it."
"21726140","21727180"," It's the only hope they got."
"21729140","21733620"," The fucking dealers buying everything in cash market. "
"21734080","21736300"," They're like, I'll take your puts and I'll buy cash."
"21740560","21741840"," No joy for bears."
"21742240","21743000"," No joy for sellers. "
"21743880","21744700"," Tesla on the clothes."
"21745960","21754440"," Trading $274.75. Vicks crashing into this belt no matter what price is telling you on spy."
"21755240","21757120"," HYG, they tried to sell that one down. "
"21758260","21764260"," Sometimes you'll see this stuff and they'll try to sell indexes that are less traded than others."
"21765680","21768480"," And like Dazdak, dude, just fucking beast mode."
"21769080","21770340"," Just beast mode. "
"21771480","21773220"," So I'll see all of you guys here tomorrow."
"21773480","21774200"," We got three minutes left."
"21774380","21775620"," I'll see all of you guys here tomorrow. "
"21776620","21779860"," At 9.30 in the morning, I apologize for being late this morning."
"21780560","21785800"," I had some technical issues, but I had some stuff that I had to do to get the stream up"
"21785800","21786160"," and running."
"21786840","21791580"," And then I had some issues with TD Ameritrade this morning and said to send them an email and talk"
"21791580","21792120"," to those guys. "
"21793560","21798220"," So tomorrow morning, I should be good to go right at 9.30. And I will see you guys here"
"21798220","21799600"," for J-Pows testimony."
"21799960","21801960"," Let me know in the chat what you think is going to happen tomorrow."
"21801960","21803660"," I don't see it, man. "
"21803820","21810860"," The only thing that I'm seeing here for any kind of bearishness or sell side is, I don't know, a"
"21810860","21814240"," hedge fund trying to use dealers on their side here into the clothes."
"21815460","21817040"," Like amplifying a dealer move."
"21817780","21819440"," It's all suspect scam shit. "
"21820140","21821100"," That's the truth."
"21821580","21822120"," It's all suspect."
"21823240","21826420"," You'll see this stuff when you know that sellers aren't in control of the market. "
"21826680","21829360"," So that's their only hope here."
"21829360","21832500"," The only thing they got hope going into tomorrow is selling futures."
"21833600","21835460"," No real money selling that I can see. "
"21835620","21838580"," Not from you, not from people partaking this market."
"21844800","21846240"," It's just scam selling."
"21846620","21847060"," That's it. "
"21847460","21848500"," That's all I can see."
"21849260","21850920"," I don't see any fear from bulls."
"21851400","21854580"," I don't see any like we're selling the market, any of that kind of stuff. "
"21855740","21857600"," So hopefully you get a down day tomorrow."
"21858940","21864120"," Hopefully get a down day and we can create some bullshit to get a price to where they want it"
"21864120","21865460"," so they can buy a dip."
"21866160","21868560"," We know that we're looking for the daily trigger down below. "
"21870160","21872180"," Sellers though, not doing much today."
"21872940","21875260"," Revenge traded the entire day here, right?"
"21876200","21877640"," Could not get it down."
"21877820","21881260"," They tried one, two, three, four, five, six. "
"21882880","21884420"," Still have their hedge on."
"21884420","21887660"," And you can see the whiplash into this close."
"21888260","21889700"," They are pissed off. "
"21890320","21891560"," They are fucking pissed."
"21891780","21892380"," I assure you."
"21892920","21898780"," And if they can't get this done inside of cash market, they're going to try to use the dealers to"
"21898780","21902400"," do it for you outside of cash market here. "
"21903060","21904180"," So just that's all."
"21904420","21906080"," The only thing it says is we're in positive gamma."
"21906960","21911800"," Dealers will typically sell futures and hopefully we can get this color. "
"21911800","21914740"," Hopefully we can get down here to this daily trigger."
"21915540","21917500"," This 4.26 or so."
"21918500","21920380"," At least by the end of the month, right?"
"21920960","21923280"," Can we get like a slow bleed off down there?"
"21923420","21923720"," Something. "
"21925500","21926700"," Otherwise we're chasing."
