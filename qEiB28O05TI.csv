"qEiB28O05TI","0","18200"," this is the fireside chat moment this morning, and we're gonna talk about it briefly, okay?"
"qEiB28O05TI","18200","30280"," If you're a bear, a natural I like to sell, I'm gonna beg you to be full, tactful in"
"qEiB28O05TI","30280","38760"," your selling. I want you to be like, I don't know, a sniper. You can walk this market"
"qEiB28O05TI","38760","50240"," down to 4,900. Do not get crazy unless we break that 4,900. If you want to get like"
"qEiB28O05TI","50240","63360"," balls to the walls, bear it up 4,900. And you will get, you will get what you're looking"
"qEiB28O05TI","63360","72480"," for in velocity to the downside, okay? So 4,900 is when you get, I don't know, you"
"qEiB28O05TI","72480","78000"," start lubing up, you shave your chest, you shave all the hair off your feet, start sending"
"qEiB28O05TI","78000","89240"," me sexier feet pics. That's when you get really crazy, okay? Now here's the converse"
"qEiB28O05TI","89240","100760"," warning for bulls. If you are a bull, I implore you. I'm imploring you here. So the one thing"
"qEiB28O05TI","100760","112120"," about our chat though is retailers are normally bulls. They're forever optimistic. And so when"
"qEiB28O05TI","112120","119720"," things are going in a bull's favor, everything is fine. They may get a little bit of panic"
"qEiB28O05TI","119720","131000"," here and there, but they will buy a dip and it'll come back. And they're happy again. And they come"
"qEiB28O05TI","131000","137200"," back and say, look, I just bought the dip. Everything is great. I'm making money. Everything is wonderful."
"qEiB28O05TI","137880","143760"," You understand what I'm saying here? Now, the problem that comes in for bulls is you become"
"qEiB28O05TI","143760","152240"," trained for that to always happen. You take on more risk than you should. You don't pay"
"qEiB28O05TI","153760","165160"," cheap insurance. You don't manage your risk managing risk. And you become more aggressive"
"qEiB28O05TI","165160","170920"," and you become more, you know, I'm a great trader. Right? So then you're like, you know what I'm"
"qEiB28O05TI","170920","176920"," going to do? I was, I was trading 500 bucks. Then I was trading 1000. Then I was trading 10,000."
"qEiB28O05TI","177480","183080"," Then I was trading 100,000. I was doing $35,000 blocks, $50,000 blocks like it's nothing. And I'm"
"qEiB28O05TI","183080","190840"," printing money. And everything is great. You begin to take trades that are very high risk."
"qEiB28O05TI","191720","198040"," You begin to lose those trades. You lose one, then you go, you know what? I'll just make it up on"
"qEiB28O05TI","198040","203480"," the back end. I'll take a bigger trade the next time. I got like nine straight wins here. There's no"
"qEiB28O05TI","203480","211880"," way I'm going to get two or three or four in a row. You start to lose trades, right? And all along,"
"qEiB28O05TI","211880","219800"," rather than just managing your risk, you start to make poor and poor decisions as a trader."
"qEiB28O05TI","221080","229000"," So I want you to consider that as we move into the rest of this week, I want you to consider that"
"qEiB28O05TI","229960","237480"," as we move into the end of March into the quarterly OPEX and the volatility that is actually coming"
"qEiB28O05TI","237480","245080"," down the road. So you can stay bold up. You can still buy the dip as a bull. But the reason I'm"
"qEiB28O05TI","245080","250360"," saying this is because in that chat with Fork yesterday, bulls are happy right now."
"qEiB28O05TI","251720","258920"," And if they begin to blow up large leads in the market, they start to become saltier and saltier."
"qEiB28O05TI","259800","265480"," And they want you to they want to rely upon you to they want to rely upon me too to be like,"
"qEiB28O05TI","265480","269400"," well, that that guy is great at calling tops. He's great at calling corrections. He makes private"
"qEiB28O05TI","269400","276680"," videos for me post them on discord. That's what I do actually make videos that are private"
"qEiB28O05TI","276680","284200"," and post them in the discord, right, for our community at least. And that is how a lot of bulls"
"qEiB28O05TI","284200","289720"," manage their risk. I'm going to look towards a furu. I'm going to look towards the bottom and"
"qEiB28O05TI","289720","298440"," top collar to be my bell leather for this is the top or this is not the top. That is poor"
"qEiB28O05TI","298520","305160"," management of risk. And especially right now, especially as we haven't had the run has been"
"qEiB28O05TI","305160","312920"," outstanding. If you are a bull, you pay to play is my point. It's okay for you to buy cheap"
"qEiB28O05TI","312920","318600"," protection. If you're taking this is simplified, but if you buy a call for a dollar,"
"qEiB28O05TI","320120","326600"," I'm assuming that you're not expecting that call to go to a dollar 10. I'm assuming that you're"
"qEiB28O05TI","326680","333160"," expecting that call to go to two dollars or three or five, whatever it is, but more than likely"
"qEiB28O05TI","333160","337560"," in your brain, you're saying to yourself, that bad call for a dollar, I'm expecting to go to two."
"qEiB28O05TI","338360","344920"," I want 100% print on that call. So right now, at this point, I'm begging you out there,"
"qEiB28O05TI","344920","348680"," mark this. Can you someone out there on Twitter, Twitch, a moderator,"
"qEiB28O05TI","349320","357160"," or a fork, if you're out there, you could please put a marker on this video right now,"
"qEiB28O05TI","357960","362360"," because I don't want to come back and say, I told you so and you said, I don't remember that."
"qEiB28O05TI","367080","372200"," I want you to, I want to be able to cut this part of the video out and say, do you remember"
"qEiB28O05TI","372200","380680"," when we had this conversation on March 5th of March, the 5th of March, to be thinking about"
"qEiB28O05TI","382760","388440"," this conversation that we're having as a bull or as a retail bull, that you should be putting"
"qEiB28O05TI","389560","397320"," on tops from now into March, cheap hedging, just dirt cheap. Part of your plan, whatever it is"
"qEiB28O05TI","397320","406040"," you're doing. Over conference, the slow and insidious killer, absolutely. And it's likely"
"qEiB28O05TI","406040","413240"," going to catch some, it's likely going to catch some people off guard sooner than later, not like"
"qEiB28O05TI","413240","420680"," it's early in January or December or October. Right around now, there should be some high volatility"
"qEiB28O05TI","420680","427240"," coming into the market, it's not necessarily down, but volatility. And if you are not a great"
"qEiB28O05TI","427240","432200"," trader and you try to trade volatility, how many of you out there think you can trade volatility"
"qEiB28O05TI","432200","439320"," well? How many of you think that you're great at trading volatility? Strain volatility is not easy."
"qEiB28O05TI","440760","445960"," It's very difficult. You're looking for a dip, you're selling the rip, you're looking for a dip,"
"qEiB28O05TI","445960","451160"," you're selling the rip. You are like tactful, you're not so much just buying a dip and I'm going to"
"qEiB28O05TI","451160","456920"," watch just buy a monthly column and come back and it's going to be printing 5000%. That time"
"qEiB28O05TI","456920","462120"," period is likely over for you for a period of time. You're likely going to get, instead of doing,"
"qEiB28O05TI","463240","470760"," instead of doing this right here, right, you're likely going to see more of this right here."
"qEiB28O05TI","473080","478760"," See what I'm saying? Stuff like that. And you have to be able to trade this right here"
"qEiB28O05TI","479080","485160"," and not so much that right there. Does that make sense to you?"
"qEiB28O05TI","486520","492840"," I tried to simplify this for you as a trader. I'm hoping that that gives you a better idea"
"qEiB28O05TI","492840","498520"," because you'll come back and say, yeah, we got a new high up here, right? But then the next day"
"qEiB28O05TI","498520","503560"," we're down here, right? So your calls are going to get wrecked in here. If you're thinking you're"
"qEiB28O05TI","503640","510280"," going to get this trade up there. Then look at that. We got a nice little pushback right here"
"qEiB28O05TI","510280","514120"," on that five minute trigger, trying to send you right back down. Look at that volatility right"
"qEiB28O05TI","514120","521480"," there. Almost already proving my point. They're trying to sell you right off the early trigger"
"qEiB28O05TI","521480","525720"," up here. It's pretty bearish right there, by the way. So glad I'm not in calls right now."
"qEiB28O05TI","525720","533560"," It's so glad I'm not in calls, right? Well, I'm in calls, but not those calls. Hold on one second here."
