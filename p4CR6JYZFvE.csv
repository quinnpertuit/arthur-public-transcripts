"200","3019"," Before the film begins good"
"52110","66010"," morning"
"74010","80110"," out there how y'all doing turning out here as fast as I can for you guys before the opening"
"80110","89500"," bell here they get right into it here this morning uh"
"89500","98160"," this is your early"
"98160","103940"," we'll talk about that it was a bush"
"103940","113780"," good morning if you're just joining us I wanted to uh so"
"113780","125620"," yesterday's close the lights in here are really weird right now I can't see I can't see myself we"
"125620","135300"," turn that up weirdness with the lights this morning hold on here well so good morning out there"
"135300","144920"," just a second here on this opening bell is a couple things to be known okay we can"
"144920","156160"," make uh there's two things that can happen here on this open you've got you've"
"156160","161480"," got an idea that we can go to the moon here right i'm sure people out there are like we"
"161480","171420"," can go to 430 like today when you buy zero dates one dates"
"171420","181100"," three dates and to some extent five dates in this market on the spot but they are still"
"181100","189900"," basically directional trades like point a two point b do not forget that uh no you can't hold this"
"189900","196960"," shit a weekly if the if the market goes the other way i'm sorry that that doesn't work it used"
"196960","204080"," to it used to work doesn't work anymore too much volatility and swings uh so at one time it worked"
"204080","212740"," i'll say that at one time it worked but it doesn't any longer so if you this is like a"
"212740","217420"," rule for me okay if you if you're really picking a trade or wherever it's going or whatever you"
"217420","226620"," better be going in the fucking direction that you think it's going right away and you and you have"
"226620","233440"," a it's going this way i'm going to take profit and i'm out there's two reasons for this uh two"
"233440","240220"," big reasons first one is that directionally you should be right when you get into your trade you"
"240220","244140"," shouldn't be like taking a trade and being in the fucking red sorry for swearing right away in this"
"244140","250360"," morning the second reason is because if you realize profit and you still think that we're going in"
"250360","260220"," that direction specifically you can renegotiate price right"
"260220","268100"," so if i buy some for 10 cents turns into 30 i can sell that for 20 cents profit take"
"268100","273800"," 10 cents and roll that into a new trade in that conviction that i have when we hold something"
"273800","282280"," overnight too specifically it's a directional trade the third thing is this is that when when you"
"282280","287120"," have zero dates if you're or one dates even three dates if you're going in that direction and the"
"287120","295900"," direction changes data uh will kill you especially on on on the spy complex and"
"295900","302100"," constantly through the day those prices are being renegotiated based upon vol in the market as well"
"302100","308920"," right in participants so you like it's like it's like we made a deal right so we made a deal"
"308920","316380"," from the close into the open specifically when once you come into that open can we go green bar up"
"316380","321760"," north fuck yeah but if you're directionally right at that point and you've got money coming in you"
"321760","327800"," realize those gains and if you're like hey cap we're at 424 21 if we open at this we're gonna"
"327800","331740"," be able to hit this price right now you're like we're gonna go high we're going to 426 going to"
"331740","339260"," 430 cap that's fine take the profit off that call side rebuy your 426s or your for or your 430s"
"339260","341660"," at a much cheaper price whatever it is that you think you're going to be able to get out there's"
"341660","341660"," going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's"
"341660","341660"," going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's"
"341660","341660"," going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's"
"341660","341660"," going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's going to get out there's"
"341660","346840"," going to get out there we go unto if we red barred down for five minutes we enter those 426's"
"346840","354960"," again just remember like it's directional and you have to be faster than anybody else now let's say"
"354960","360740"," I was talking of buddy thissk same my buddies like well I think we just hold both sides all day"
"360740","367200"," long and see which one prints and I'm like yeah like that trade to make like the idea of that"
"367200","377200"," its like here' Do we could we could run some of those say to see what is the best"
"377200","379600"," idea for me personally?"
"381020","391020"," That's not how I trade now something else about how I trade is what here something else about how I"
"391020","400620"," trade is for twenty fifty one if I'm losing"
"400620","409620"," on the opening bell let's say let's say about just puts yesterday right and they're down"
"409620","419410"," right then let's say about puts yesterday for ten"
"419410","429250"," cents and they're down like three cents on the opening bell I'm not trying to say that three cents"
"429250","437010"," I'll just leave those on like a free trade if they hit they hit now yesterday I had purchased some"
"437010","447120"," puts yesterday and I bought some puts"
"447120","456180"," yesterday and I had a stop on them I think I lost a penny on them total got a gap"
"456180","463820"," down below the close by the way this morning now that's one thing right so let's say I buy some"
"463820","470980"," puts on a trade or calls doesn't really matter let's say I buy some puts on a trade and they"
"470980","476300"," directionally get burned and I'm and I got a finger on my finger is my limit stop right my stop"
"476300","486220"," right then oh I was taking it for 24 or 24 23 we get"
"486220","494560"," some we get some we get some it's a moves coming up here it's a range expansion"
"494560","503260"," some big old range expansion expected today"
"503260","513220"," so five minutes left so my point here"
"513220","519280"," is that let's say I let's say it's stopped out of the penny that's what's fine but if I don't"
"519280","524300"," get stopped at a penny down to like three cents from a ten cent put or something like that I'm"
"524300","532640"," not going to sell and just get chopped up right four four twenty six sixty four extended gains with"
"532640","539380"," brands and U.S. crude futures rising by two dollars a barrel so far on the session and croissant"
"539380","545540"," was saying that so somebody mentioned to me that croissant got cut up yesterday and when you're"
"545540","550600"," getting cut up that bad this is for myself as well if I'm let's say I take a side in"
"550600","556080"," a trade number wrong right boom I called it wrong and I didn't have a stop I was gonna hand"
"556080","561320"," and it was gonna hand trigger a stop and I don't know I gotta take a shit or something to"
"561320","566680"," go to the bathroom I don't know I was drinking whiskey whatever it is if I'm already down that hard"
"566680","572340"," in that position you might as well just leave them on and to that point yesterday croissant would"
"572340","577940"," have been able to have closed those at the end of the day so try not to try to try"
"577940","582640"," to be try to be if you're not picking directionally where we're going right away there's something"
"582640","589780"," wrong in the mechanics of the trade and how you're trading and if it does go against you which does"
"589780","600420"," it for people it goes against them right I"
"601990","611980"," got some so we have talked today at some"

"5275720","5282700"," basically like quietly in the background no one wanted to discuss it because JPM was basically"

"5378940","5386600"," to gravitate lower from that point right so we'll go up to that 430 tag it slightly above it"
"5386600","5392960"," usually and then we'll start to drift lower and down towards the middle strike you'll always get to"

"6367210","6376270"," time could be five days can we go higher from there yes as breadth improves on other sectors within"
"6376270","6385490"," the s&p 500 we could begin to experience experience large violent moves to the upside be looking"
"6385490","6395440"," for a price in the vix down to 10 oh dude 430s we're at six cents i just"
"6395440","6410570"," sold them for 10 or for 10 cents you're now trading 11 cents right now fuck yeah this"

"6440690","6446670"," there should be a violence reversal as we start as we begin to close out the gaps left up higher"
"6447970","6454590"," like 440 there should be a big reversal now there'll be a lot of panic as we head towards 460"
"6454590","6467270"," if we stay on track it'll become volatile as we get up there there's"
"6467270","6473370"," we'll go we'll look at this right now i'll show you this take a look at something here for you"
"6473370","6485100"," guys damn it i should have stayed in those four fucking 30s here i'll show you guys some you"

"6490080","6496140"," retest down below at 42690 hopefully i can jump back on the train if we roll back down and trade"
"6496140","6507920"," for a tester have a liquidation break at 42 5.51 price target above 43067 we"
"6507920","6517880"," have a little bit of supply right here"
"6525480","6529120"," so we're gonna i'm gonna show you if you're if you're joining in right now we're gonna talk about"
"6529120","6547760"," something okay about that move higher today"
"6547760","6611510"," and show you this somewhere else hold on here some"
"6611510","6629930"," some important con some important constructs for you guys to understand here do"
"6629930","6656490"," this on spx2 doesn't matter if you prefer spx you can do an spx it's"
"6656490","6663090"," two key points i want to uh couple key points i want to talk to you about okay i want"
"6663090","6670570"," you to see see this yellow line right here i want you to see this yellow line that i have"
"6670570","6680810"," right here okay so as we were coming into the top of 2021 on spx i"
"6680810","6689720"," want you to see this here see this this blue box right here it's like monthly velocity okay monthly"
"6689720","6697040"," velocity was peeking and topping out up here it was at uh 50 or so okay same thing on weekly"
"6697040","6703920"," these are these are the really the ones that are important here as the as the weekly and monthly"
"6703920","6713580"," velocity uh begin begin to top out and roll over okay"
"6716980","6728140"," and it was telling you before we got there that a roll was coming okay i"
"6728140","6732040"," want you to look at that right now in this stream it's important that you can see this we're we're"
"6732040","6739960"," maxing out velocity to the upside on the weekly and monthly price is still peeking so we have price"
"6739960","6748940"," divergence to the upside versus declining velocity on higher time frames it's telling you the"
"6748940","6755980"," market's going to roll over is what's telling you over here on this side we're kind of in the dumps"
"6755980","6765500"," down here right we're trying to regain velocity in the monthly and you can also see that weekly can"
"6765500","6775260"," stay up for some time period right and we haven't cycled up yet in monthly velocity here"
"6776340","6781160"," so what it's telling you is that we have some time where we can continue to go up until we"
"6781160","6790680"," peek again for the next rollover in spx time and again in the past"
"6793220","6806600"," we can actually predict these rollovers we can actually also predict targets to the downside we"
"6806600","6814620"," can even predict big ones 2008 2009 bottom down here and"
"6814620","6823970"," we can also pause it a few things the more expansion that we have the more expansion that we have"
"6823970","6833870"," behind these things the more volatility can come into the market the tighter that"
"6833870","6843750"," they get tighter wider tighter the less volatility we get in the market like a rubber band right"
"6843750","6851710"," when it stretches we have violent moves to the downside right one of the greatest tricks"
"6851710","6860610"," that the Fed did was add time"
"6860610","6869970"," for velocity to catch up so that even if we do go down the destruction"
"6869970","6877470"," is less see how all this velocity came up from the downside right so the longer we trade sideways"
"6877470","6887070"," the less damage is done to the S&P 500 while they're knocking out single legs"
"6887070","6892910"," underneath the S&P 500 like hey we're gonna go in like a surgeon we're gonna take out all these"
"6892910","6897750"," shitty companies in regional banks then we're gonna go over and we're gonna take out all these"
"6897750","6906230"," shitty commercial real estate companies and we're gonna make the market trade sideways ultimately"
"6906230","6914590"," the damage or the risk of damage to the downside becomes less so if we had if we're cranking like"
"6914590","6923890"," this we have a lot of risk to a major downside move right but as time passes that risk goes"
"6923890","6933330"," higher and higher in price the threat the soft landing becomes more"
"6933330","6942910"," valid as time passes with the S&P 500 here there was more risk to a major move down"
"6942910","6952790"," here the move down becomes less violent if we don't roll this market over"
"6952790","6960150"," for a year or two we probably likely will never see anything lower than 3400 or 3200 it's time"
"6960150","6968190"," passes time it's the one trick they're pulling right now it's time passes maybe it's touch and go"
"6968190","6978050"," believe it or not time is the key here we're not blasting up north in three"
"6978050","6987910"," months or six months we had a controlled demolition to the downside Bari said you bought"
"6987910","6997640"," the dip more violence the more stretch that we have as time passes and this is another key part i"
"6997640","7008440"," want to show you this see that yellow that orange the"
"7008440","7014640"," yellow and orange cross right there this is indicative of of of of all to market we were told here"
"7014640","7019720"," we get try to take a breather we get underneath it just more grabbing of liquidity to go down right"
"7019720","7028340"," when price is above trading above the yellow line so you got price yellow orange blue"
"7028340","7038340"," we're in a bush risk on environment when price and the"
"7038340","7046400"," yellow line break below the orange line we're in a risk off sell environment you see it see it down"
"7046400","7056280"," here right volatile dangerous price yellow orange blue risk on"
"7056280","7066100"," what is happening right now price yellow orange blue we're in the"
"7066100","7075380"," middle of a breakout to the upside we're getting yellow orange blue again till we break this and"
"7075380","7082160"," this yellow and orange come underneath we are in a risk on environment to the upside we are looking"
"7082160","7090620"," to buy dips below currently at 415816 and"
"7090620","7101250"," 407193 it really began in earnest back in march 28th that's"

"7108690","7115990"," back here tried it back in december had the dip by in october but truly the separation and when you"
"7115990","7125710"," started seeing on twitter saying murder the vix that's where i started posting it stable market"
"7125710","7135710"," until that changes we're in a stable market how long does"
"7135710","7144590"," this last i can show you every time how long does it last because the question was hey man how"
"7144590","7151650"," long we've been long for you can see it happen right here happened right there how long long time"

"7582240","7594020"," maybe sell the seller may with a nice gucci bag nice bag to hold yeah i'm"
"7594020","7601060"," still down on the uh i'm still down on the uh uh i'm on the sideways trade into into early"
"7601060","7605920"," june here and i really like to see us have a june low i thought well what i want to"
"7605920","7611900"," see is that what the jpm collar does you guys know what the jpm collar does i'll give you a"
"7611900","7620000"," brief like dummy explanation if you want it it's a bear seagull okay there's a bunch of reasons for"
"7620000","7626460"," this trade uh the simple fight answer for you that think what you need to know is that when that"
"7626460","7631800"," trade is placed they have an idea of where they think the market's going to go where they think"
"7631800","7641140"," they want it to go banks love low volatility markets that trade sideways they sell products to"
"7641140","7647400"," their clients i don't want to go to a client and say yeah we're all over the place with our"
"7647400","7654640"," returns for you right they like ten eleven months of steady returns maybe one month of volatility"
"7654640","7661320"," and they say don't worry about it we hedged it consistent returns every month month over month they"
"7661320","7668660"," love that shit they know where to sell they know where to buy now when they put a hedge in"
"7668660","7677000"," the market it's not it's not like the best money making hedge they're better hedges but why they"
"7677000","7681780"," put this on and how they put it on and what it means is they don't care where the market"
"7681780","7688800"," necessarily goes right this is the basic idea of this if the market goes up right screams out of"
"7688800","7695020"," control they have purchased now their protection to the downside it's like a base like not"
"7695020","7701980"," complicating this if the market goes down right they get paid again and have exposure to the upside"
"7701980","7710380"," to make more money they really can't lose with this trade and there's other reasons for this trade"
"7710380","7718000"," as well it it tends to dampen markets uh tendency to move higher from the strikes that they placed"
"7718000","7726860"," so on the upside right at that 43 number the bear seagull then tends to act as resistance to the"
"7726860","7734820"," market screaming higher so if we hit 430 whatever it is 430 28 whatever the fuck they think i don't"
"7734820","7738940"," remember it's that right now you'll have a tendency to want to push the market lower at that point"
"7738940","7744820"," and there are other people to place that trade as well not just jpm other banks people follow it"
"7744820","7751140"," other banks do it now can we run over it fuck yeah we can and that's more upside for them"
"7751140","7758260"," as well but it does tend to blunt the move higher once we tag it so so so the i"
"7758260","7765440"," or so what the what the caller does or its impact changes where price is and it will act as"
"7765440","7772920"," like a pushing down effect on the market while it's still on it's like david a mess is saying right"
"7772920","7777560"," here i like to sell and may go away right you leave with a gucci bag you go into june"
"7777560","7786180"," we trade sideways and down right we will tend to trade below that hedge tend to we don't have to"
"7786180","7794400"," but we will tend to why do they put that hedge on people like it's to protect themselves it's not"
"7794400","7802760"," just that reason uh the market is made up of like nine percent dealer money you then you've got"
"7802760","7809440"," about 65 percent of the money coming from institutions you got about 25 percent of the rest of the"
"7809440","7818060"," market uh 25 to 30 it bounces around of retail retail is generally bullish"
"7818060","7827320"," generally but they're erratic they can't be trusted when you hear like retail is dumb"
"7827320","7834560"," they can that's where that comes from retail is dumb meaning uh they're like uh they're like i"
"7834560","7838920"," heard a sheep that can be scared they can run left they can run right they can be influenced"
"7840480","7849250"," they're not one cohesive unit now when you have real money buying real money selling right the"
"7849250","7854490"," banks can move the market where they want to right they know where they're going up down sideways"
"7854490","7860950"," when you don't see a lot of volume in the market though there are other forces that can move the"
"7860950","7868490"," market dealers dealers are like we know what we're doing right we had nine percent they're like oh"
"7868490","7875830"," retail's got 30 25 yeah but they're not concentrated in direction are they right so they facilitate"
"7875830","7882850"," in low volume markets where it goes right they facilitate what retailers are doing small funds are"
"7882850","7892000"," doing facilitate you and i gambling out there right well the banks even though they move the market"
"7892000","7898760"," with size they can also impact the market when they aren't making large moves so when a bank isn't"
"7898760","7905500"," making a large move guess how they put their hand on the market while retail's duking it out while"
"7905500","7915220"," the dealers are trying to facilitate this going on they do it with hedging they have a hand even"
"7915220","7923260"," in the low volume market with their hedging and that tones down price discovery if you were to"
"7923260","7929880"," leave price discovery up to retailers you'd see like a million people trade in tesla and it would"
"7929880","7934400"," go to the fucking moon it would go to like fifty million dollars and it'd be left with two traders"
"7934400","7938620"," trying to duke it out until somebody panicked you'd see tesla like go to the moon comes straight"
"7938620","7942080"," back down go to the moon comes straight back down you see this in other countries third fourth"
"7942080","7947160"," world countries where you have true price discovery people are like i want to see i want to see"
"7947160","7952580"," real price discovery i'm like you have no fucking idea how terrible that would be and so banks want"
"7952580","7961860"," to tone that shit down that's what they like they want regular returns if jpm do you think jpm"
"7961860","7973500"," wants to have like a Nigerian stock market you're wrong they don't trying"
"7973500","7980100"," to break higher right now and melt up and go up the wall of worry into the first week of"
"7980100","7991630"," june the"
"7991630","7999570"," next gap is right here do you see it what does that say right there next gap previous gap from"
"7999570","8009490"," the way back when previous gap from way back when right there that's the next gap david do you"
"8009490","8024150"," see that that's right from the before times hahaha dj garth auger said from the before times so"
"8024150","8030570"," as we come into this as we come into this collar can we run it over yes will we trade"
"8030570","8037410"," it if it does fuck yeah we will uh the idea here though is once we tag that collar and"
"8037410","8043130"," get up on that collar we should drift lower that seagull they should monetize and we should begin"
"8043130","8048390"," to drift lower and start to tag those lows we know that into the 24th we know that at the"
"8048390","8057130"," end of quarter we have sizable sizable bearish positions that have been destroyed right and as they"
"8057130","8063730"," get destroyed we can go back down there and tag those clean up that side of the of it's clean"
"8063730","8073550"," up that side of the options chain and then continue on higher the right davian right here man watch"
"8073550","8085980"," my cursor brother right there so"
"8085980","8103620"," bullish so gonna have to buy a bottle of fancy brown liquor today right"
"8103620","8113250"," up here uh why did that one"
"8113250","8118030"," notification go off an hour ago saying to get out of the lungs what was that picking up on so"
"8118030","8127350"," i trade when i trade i trade high probability trades so when i hit extreme"
"8127350","8136490"," bullishness or extreme bearishness i take the money and run can we extend from there yes but when i"
"8136490","8141770"," start to get i get two alerts i'm always looking for we're extremely bearish and we're extremely"
"8141770","8150370"," bullish what that tells me is begin to look to close out longs or begin to look to close out"
"8150370","8159770"," shorts and begin to look to position myself for the other side of the trade now"
"8159770","8167030"," this market right here what it looks like is 2021 so what does that mean if we roll we will"
"8167030","8175490"," likely roll hard and heavy but there's likely a dip to buy as well we know right now that those"
"8175490","8180250"," dips are on the hourly and the daily trigger we could go down to the weekly we'll trade them level"
"8180250","8188150"," to level so as we go up here for this collar let's say we tagged 430 could take three four"
"8188150","8196969"," five days we trade sideways and then down for the end of quarter low and then begin to make our"
"8196969","8203590"," way back higher again and start to take out 440 450 460 could take us the entire summer into the"
"8203590","8210290"," fall i know that bulls out here are like yeah we should hit 460 next week it's never use it's"
"8210290","8216309"," never usually like that fast it might be if it does if we roll this 430 and come right back"
"8216309","8222430"," up we're gonna start traded again i'll take it from 430 to 440 no problem but it's never it's"
"8222430","8235920"," usually for bulls it's never usually straight bars up usually takes time yeah we've"
"8235920","8240920"," been bullish since may believe it or not let's start not bullish we were in a volatile environment"
"8240920","8248000"," but you could see the bottoming process taking place last summer and fall you could see it it"
"8248000","8256340"," wasn't bottom but you could see like the a bottom not the bottom a bottom being hammered out but"
"8256340","8262680"," yesterday in stream i talked to you about wack off scenarios we will try to go over those again"
"8262680","8267280"," with you in more detail i'm going to try to do an overlay for you so you can see where"
"8267280","8273120"," we are likely at in all four of those scenarios there's a high probability and there's likely"
"8273120","8281620"," traders trading to either of those four which includes two scenarios of closing out previous gaps"
"8281620","8287940"," and then rolling down again and the other two scenarios are we make all-time highs and then roll"
"8287940","8297809"," over and those are the bearish scenarios those are the most bearish scenarios"
"8297809","8307299"," that are out there uh no they're not so"
"8307299","8313420"," on this chart right here they're not emas i have to adjust them on this so just that if you're"

"8785810","8795470"," so the script uses uh the script uses um neural pathways to be honest with you uh it's based"
"8795470","8804510"," upon it's based upon trying to communicate neural pathways from algorithms written in the 1970s uh"
"8804510","8812550"," for people that are blind or uh deaf so yes uh they use greeks uh but they use they use"
"8812550","8819610"," a lot of high math concepts of fractals and stuff like that predicted predictive algorithms there's"
"8819610","8824130"," a lot of work done in the 70s and then in the 1990s any old traders know about a lot"
"8824130","8839860"," of this stuff basically"
"8839860","8848880"," the idea is like in the 1970s um very smart people were trying to develop uh what would you call"
"8848880","8858520"," it like um tools for people with disabilities and so they're applying these same concepts to um"
"8858520","8867560"," these indicators yeah they send two they send mice down a maze we've got pigeons and uh they come"
"8867560","8876700"," to the window cell and it says buy or sell i can i can assure you"
"8876700","8886600"," oh you are hiring in tech nice uh we've got one so you can probably ask a few people in"
"8886600","8894340"," this stream uh very smart people and i've i've told them this is highly predictive it works and"
"8894340","8898780"," they're like i don't believe you so i'm like okay i'm like how about these are very smart people"
"8898780","8902140"," i'm like how about this how about like how about i text you every time we have a trend day"
"8904020","8908240"," i was like how about i do that every time i text you it'll it'll be a hundred percent of"
"8908240","8914460"," the time and they go i don't believe you i said okay so i haven't been wrong yet not once"
"8914460","8924360"," not a single time so uh yeah i'll leave it there you"

"8940420","8945040"," you probably need some you probably need it probably did a very small group i'm assuming it's going"
"8945040","8952000"," to turn into that or it could turn a hedge fund or something could be something like that too we'll"
"8954270","8964220"," see we'll see we'll see how we we'll see what happens we'll see what happens well we're going to"

"8969860","8974240"," here is that we're all going to look at it together as a group it'll be like you know hundred"
"8974240","8979340"," of us a couple hundred of us three hundred of us whatever uh we'll start working on uh does it"
"8979340","8985040"," work because it's not work we'll we'll monitor it's behavior as a group futures forward and you"
"8985040","8990460"," know it turns into something good uh if we need to make adjustments we will and we'll try not to"
"8990460","8994960"," let it out into the public too much you guys don't want to be telling people about this shit just"
"8994960","9006000"," hang out man come to stream every day we'll hang out in the discord we'll fuck around with it where"

"9045120","9051540"," so we're going to talk about some we're talking about something called time right now okay i want"
"9051540","9061380"," to talk about time with you right now so the stock market some of you already"
"9061380","9069680"," know this but some of you don't the stock market works on an hourly system on the half an hour"
"9069680","9076520"," wait i remember that okay so you guys talk about things like like nine o'clock ten o'clock eleven"
"9076520","9083320"," o'clock twelve o'clock one o'clock scrub that shit from your brain in your head just get rid"
"9083320","9089140"," of that in your mind get rid of get rid of like the hour i'm going to start thinking about"
"9089140","9099080"," the stock market in terms of the hourly being on the actual half an hour okay so now today's kind"
"9099080","9108750"," of a unique day right today's kind of a unique day out there but in general"
"9108750","9112940"," i want you to think about everything in terms of the hour and the half an hour so nine 30"
"9112940","9118960"," to 10 30 10 30 to 11 30 11 30 to 12 30 all the way to the 5 to"
"9118960","9123940"," the 430 hour every day you can think about this the same way at night time too with futures and"
"9123940","9131840"," globex but i want to think about the stock market in an hourly time frame i"
"9131840","9141840"," want you to think about about buyers and sellers supply and demand on the hour"
"9141840","9149920"," start to think about that and where supply and demand is and the strength of supply and demand on"
"9149920","9156080"," the hour and also on the half an hour and the 15 minute right so if we start an hour"
"9156080","9165320"," at nine 30 it's going to tell us something right is buy side and that hour have more strength than"
"9165320","9172080"," sell side and they have to prove certain things in that hour period we can break that down on half"
"9172080","9180360"," hours and 15 minutes so our buyers winning the hour our buyers winning the half an hour our buyers"
"9180360","9186480"," winning the 15 minute our sellers winning the hour sellers winning the 15 minute sellers winning"
"9186480","9194440"," the half an hour and then the strength of those buyers or sellers in that time period we can"
"9194440","9202680"," extrapolate a few things we know just by looking at this white and red line right here that if this"
"9202680","9212660"," white line if price is going up and the white line is going up buyers have strength right we"
"9212660","9218260"," know if the white line goes sideways that buyers do not have that same strength that they had when"
"9218260","9225140"," it was going up right if we were going down right now if price was heading down and the white"
"9225140","9230560"," line was going down vertical and these are very simple concepts we know that sellers have strength"
"9231160","9237920"," we know if the white line begins to go sideways that sell side does not have as much strength as"
"9237920","9245960"," they once had right now can we continue lower yes we can we can actually put those on time frames"
"9245960","9255300"," in your own brain right when you're thinking about this and we're also going to know that we're"
"9255300","9265020"," going to check and ensure that we still have demand from buy or sell side in these time"
"9265020","9271660"," frames to this nice big push up right to that big yellow line right there pushing up pushing up"
"9273300","9282810"," right got a new high right here right you see that new high what time was it you know what"
"9282810","9290350"," time that new high was that 1130 look at that new high right there look at my cursor look down"
"9290350","9299470"," below where it's where the the scroller is when did we get that new high at 1130 so who is"
"9299470","9306150"," in control from 930 to 1130 do you know i can tell you it's by side by side was in"
"9306150","9315570"," control for two hours so i'm going to say to myself all right self we got a new high we're"
"9315570","9322250"," going straight vertical we start to trade sideways here we're going to recheck from 1130 until 12 o "
"9322250","9328090","'clock and see who's in charge of the market here is it buyers or sellers we got into the 1115"
"9328090","9336630"," or see 1145 right and we failed to make a new high so 1145 didn't we the moment we failed"
"9336630","9342990"," to make a new high 15 minutes later into the next hour we're going to now check lower we're going"
"9342990","9354340"," to look at 426 27 right down here and we're going"
"9354340","9364760"," to see if there's still demand here how long does sell side have to find out if"
"9364760","9374120"," there's demand there do you know they have another seven minutes so sell side right now must get a"
"9374120","9383860"," new low by 12 p.m they're looking for this new low right now and that would mean that sell"
"9383860","9392960"," side is still alive and they're now going to be looking lower into the 1230 hour for the next hour"
"9392960","9400660"," to get down here the 424 now we don't know if they're going to get this new low or not"
"9400660","9407200"," so are you long here or short here no well you can be short here give me a short here"
"9407200","9421690"," down to 426 27 with a stop above if we break above this previous high you'll know you can sell"
"9421690","9430830"," this 427 11 and have stops above at 427 83 and your target below is"
"9430830","9440630"," 42627 for a scalp it's just intraday kind of stuff right"
"9440630","9446590"," if i was going to take another long here what do i be looking for that can i take a"
"9446590","9455190"," long here right now i can't i need to see price get above the six cma here on a five "
"9455190","9463850","-minute chart let me show you what uh what this looks like on a one-minute chart on a one "
"9463850","9468710","-minute chart we're not actually using the yellow anymore we're using the white is now that yellow"
"9468710","9476410"," okay so what do i need to see here for me to take along here do you know i first"
"9476410","9483410"," need to see price get above the white line right here i needed to make a new high right here"
"9485390","9492650"," this white line will come up it'll make the new high and it'll confirm the move is higher this is"
"9492650","9499110"," where i enter the trade long to the upside i don't enter it here i don't enter this squeeze well"
"9499110","9505510"," you can scalp this squeeze right here but i personally don't i'm looking for i'm i'm looking to"
"9505510","9509390"," regain me we mute this uh yellow i only put the yellow line in here because i tried to trade"
"9509390","9516990"," the yep they tried to trade the five minute with you guys and not the one minute so just this"
"9516990","9528230"," white line right here on a one-minute chart see that 427 right there i'm looking for this"
"9528230","9535050"," white line to come up and i'm looking for price to confirm the move higher so it's going to get"
"9535050","9544650"," a new high boom we just got it right it should consolidate down and then it should also confirm"
"9544650","9554440"," the move higher this part of this whole trade right here the highest probability part of that"
"9554440","9560780"," trade is this one right here it's not buying down here it's not buying this shit well you can trade"
"9560780","9567540"," this but i already know sell sides hiding here and i know they're going to try to step back in"
"9567540","9576820"," right here and i know that as buyers come up we start to break free of them here one two"
"9576820","9587020"," three they're done and they get squeezed and we go up does that make sense it's"
"9587020","9596820"," 1156 right now coming into the half an hour bears are losing here they were not able"
"9596820","9601640"," and i want you to see this too this is the chop zone this is where people get cut up"
"9601640","9608700"," long shorts doesn't matter chop zone i don't trade this i used to trade it here in the but people"
"9608700","9613640"," would get all fucked up with me suddenly i can't do this we had to be entering for like five"
"9613640","9618160"," pennies and getting out of ten pennies you'd be entering at eight pennies and selling at four"
"9618160","9624680"," pennies such it's a very fast moving uh this is a very fast moving scalping shit in here so i"
"9624680","9629540"," don't do this with you guys anymore but i want you to look at some i want you to look"
"9629540","9638740"," at this setup the way that i'm looking at it so this setup for me i wouldn't trade this i'm"
"9638740","9645040"," looking for a high probability trade so where's the intraday pump i'll show it to you right now i"
"9645040","9649440"," already showed it to you and you're in brain at home you should be able to do this if you're"
"9649440","9668860"," looking for this let's do it like this i'll do it like this you're"
"9668860","9677620"," looking for a new high right a consolidation oh shit"
"9677620","9687220"," new high right here consolidation sideways and this would be"
"9688840","9694820"," your confirmation trade of the upside sometimes we'll just blast right up and you miss the trade"
"9694820","9701120"," oops i missed the trade but for like the prime setup this is what i'm looking for i'm going to"
"9701120","9707120"," set up a long to take here right so we're at 427 74 you know how you get like with"
"9707120","9711840"," liquidation breaks you'll be like oh they're just liquidation they just trip trip my trigger or"
"9711840","9718440"," they just not triggered my cell sometimes you'll see us like trade up here you'll be like woo hoo"
"9718440","9724680"," and then you'll hear somebody tell you oh they liquidated me they trip my triggers and then we"
"9724680","9734760"," continue to go higher right all goes no that your stops are in here now"
"9734760","9740700"," let's say this fails right let's say this fails right let's go up here and this fails i'm not in"
"9740700","9746080"," the trade am i not losing my ass i'm not losing my money i'm not getting stopped out i'm waiting"
"9746080","9753560"," for the confirmation again to the upside i'm waiting for the high probability setup here the trade"
"9753560","9763110"," higher you see us boom boom"
"9763110","9772070"," bouncing around garbage and i'm watching the clock as this happens so it's now 1159 what did"
"9772070","9782850"," i tell you earlier on"
"9782850","9786910"," the half an hour you want to see them so right now at 12 o'clock we just hit 12"
"9786910","9791770"," o'clock right they have about another minute now to get a new low if they don't we're going to"
"9791770","9800110"," squeeze up here they will have another half an hour as we make our way this is uh 1230 where's"
"9800110","9809670"," 1215 1230 right there we'll leave we'll move this over a little bit for you right to the"
"9809670","9818770"," 1230 hour right about there actually we'll actually be detailed in this it's concept"
"9818770","9831020"," right there now"
"9841990","9851500"," all this that i'm looking for for that move higher all this that i'm looking for"
"9851500","9857100"," is predicated upon a bunch of other stuff that i'm looking at in the background so personally"
"9857100","9865580"," personally under any normal day of the year not like a not like a fed meeting or an ER report"
"9866880","9875400"," not today with beginning of the month not being this high normally i would give this a very low"
"9875400","9882500"," probability of happening in in my experience for where we are right now we're going to roll here"
"9883100","9888420"," we're going to roll hard because i have an alert in the background saying take your fucking money"
"9888420","9900280"," and run and i still have puts here normally"
"9900280","9916030"," i think this fails and"
"9916030","9921670"," i think this fails because i want high probability setups and i've got alerts for them they work"
"9921670","9929070"," almost 100 percent of the time so it doesn't matter if it's going up or down it doesn't matter if"
"9929070","9935910"," you fucking these things work like they worked in 2022 they work in 2020 21 work every time so now"
"9935910","9946870"," personally is there is there a move higher here maybe my things are saying no so"
"9946870","9953270"," if price action proves to me otherwise that it is to the upside i need to see this i need"
"9953270","9959410"," to see that i need to see the confirmation then we go higher here and i'll take that long if"
"9959410","9965990"," price action proves that my alert is saying get the fuck out you're done no more longs no more long"
"9965990","9975270"," calls 1203 this is bullish"
"9975270","9980410"," in the next half an hour by the way even though we're rolling right here this is still most bears"
"9980410","9990010"," failed at 12 p.m to get a new low turn up bulls bears bears failed say bears but"
"9990010","9997210"," sellers failed to get a new low now can sellers still win here absolutely they still have the hour"
"9997210","10001650"," on their side it's there this is this is all like this is all for sellers they get their chance"
"10002310","10011210"," for one hour we'll find out if they're gonna win or not what would the rollover look like right"
"10011210","10020870"," here great question so if this fails here what am i looking for very easy"
"10080550","10090510"," this is where you enter to the downside right there this is"
"10090510","10098030"," the bad boy right here this is the money trade right there and that's the money trade right there"
"10100010","10109930"," this in here is destroy option time destroy bears destroy bulls like none of this"
"10109930","10113930"," is in my view when i want to what i want to be trading you have some people be like"
"10113930","10118650"," oh yeah i called it or i called it down here i bought this one and i won i bought"
"10118650","10122570"," this one and i won to the downside i bought this one and i won to the upside but i'll"

"13014730","13017090"," You can see, you should be able to see that's a one minute."
"13018250","13020810"," And then I switch back and forth between a one and a five."
"13021510","13022350"," That's a one minute. "

"13755800","13758280"," We were watching time during consolidation earlier."
"13758940","13762420"," You want to continue to count time."
"13765460","13768280"," 1256, 1257, new high, right?"
"13769560","13770520"," We're heading into 106. "
"13771220","13773080"," We want to get a new high."
"13773080","13775200"," Again, at 115."
"13778140","13780260"," You want to get another new high at 130. "
"13781420","13789820"," If we begin to make a, if we begin to make a, a progressive group of no new highs, it'll"
"13789820","13793420"," give you, it'll infer to you that this run is over, right?"
"13794320","13796400"," So we keep tracking time here."
"13797100","13802700"," If we stop making new highs every 15 minutes, every half an hour, every hour, you're going to"
"13802700","13806680"," expect the market to begin to roll over and go back and retest 427."
"13808280","13808740"," 25. "
"13842880","13845120"," Look at that big bar up there, baby."
"13845380","13845760"," You see it?"
"13850610","13852430"," On top of the world, mom."
"13854970","13859630"," And one last thing I want to let you know here as we trade this up is one last thing"
"13859630","13860510"," I want to let you know. "
"13862130","13867430"," That as we come into the end of the day, we're going to wrap this weekend up, right?"
"13869530","13877110"," There's a giant, giant in the money call structure on zero dates."
"13878610","13888360"," So as the day wears on heading into a Friday, there's two scenarios to look out"
"13888360","13889280"," for up here, right?"
"13890480","13891080"," Oh, yeah."
"13891080","13893580"," Give me that new high, baby. "
"13894220","13898480"," We want a new high on the market."
"13899140","13902060"," Can we get the new high on the market?"
"13902280","13904660"," Yes, we did get the new high on the market."
"13907220","13910560"," So just up in here with these old dirty dogs are up here, right?"
"13910820","13912960"," This previous gap from way back went over here. "
"13914560","13926290"," As we climb the wall of worry, there's"
"13926290","13928730"," two scenarios that want you to be aware of."
"13933590","13939810"," You either get the blast up here, and then we kill all these calls."
"13944500","13946940"," We start to chill out and mellow out. "
"13947180","13952340"," They murder all these calls, and then we climb the wall of worry into the Friday."
"13954740","13957380"," We're getting here likely one way or another."
"13957560","13963200"," Well, right now, price action is telling us we're getting here before the close on a Friday. "
"13964360","13973380"," Saying that we are, nothing has said yet that we aren't, but even so the little sneaky pea dealers"
"13973380","13976800"," are like, oh, we're not closing this shit in the money."
"13977780","13981280"," We're not paying you at this bell."
"13982040","13991720"," So, whether we go here now or we go here later, unless we start breaking down and want you to"
"13991720","13994560"," think about that as we come into the rest of the day. "
"13995160","13996760"," It is one ten in the afternoon."
"13997160","14000840"," You will see traders begin to wrap it up at some point."
"14001860","14004780"," Kick back, take their shoes off. "
"14006180","14010140"," Just be aware of that as we're coming up here, right?"
"14011320","14014820"," How do you assign that risk here, right?"
"14014980","14015600"," We know, right?"
"14016120","14017400"," We have stops right here."
"14018700","14021720"," We also know the big bad boy is right here."
"14022500","14032140"," So, if we start breaking down and this check fails, you'll get the dealers here not"
"14032140","14033440"," wanting to pay this money. "
"14034220","14036020"," We saw it happen two days ago."
"14036160","14037920"," We saw it happen yesterday into the bell."
"14038620","14046640"," Just be aware that if the algorithm is like, well, we're going there, the dealer's also, if we're"
"14046640","14053340"," going to go there, we'll attempt to make us go there and at the same time destroy value in options. "
"14099310","14106510"," Another thing that happens up here is they'll promise you a price like, hey, we're going to 420 and"
"14106510","14107370"," they dump it at 418."
"14108250","14113450"," Another thing that they do is they'll say we're going to 430 and they'll dump it just prior."
"14114570","14119910"," Let's see if we can glean anything from ES futures market. "
"14120170","14121350"," Where we are right now, right?"
"14121490","14125050"," We're going to check ES right now and see if ES can tell us anything."
"14182390","14184910"," I mean, look at that reach for the sky up there, right?"
"14190600","14193300"," If you're a swing trader, what are you looking for here, right?"
"14195540","14197000"," We're going to sell that, right?"
"14197320","14198440"," We're going to buy that, right?"
"14199420","14200920"," We're going to sell that, right?"
"14202900","14204940"," We're going to buy that down there, right?"
"14205940","14208360"," And you like to buy it when it's doing this."
"14209060","14211520"," You like to sell it when it's doing that, right?"
"14212900","14214580"," This is still rising. "
"14214580","14216400"," It hasn't rolled yet, right?"
"14216700","14223760"," You like to sell, get ready to sell, but not sell until we're going down, right?"
"14224600","14229860"," Zigzag channels are pointing to that 432 up there."
"14230880","14232100"," Do we know it's today?"
"14232380","14232500"," No."
"14233400","14234540"," Can it be today in the close?"
"14234880","14235100"," Yes. "
"14235100","14237160"," Can we sell Friday in the next week?"
"14237420","14237720"," Absolutely."
"14238440","14248120"," We have some targets heading into June, 4-14, 4-22, 4-07, and 4 "
"14248120","14251980","-08, right?"
"14253520","14256140"," Do we just have a failure and start rolling it over?"
"14256380","14256580"," Possible."
"14257580","14258660"," We're looking for that right now. "
"14258760","14259880"," Do we start to get that roll?"
"14261340","14265640"," Are we getting to a place where you take profit and look for another entry?"
"14266340","14267180"," Fuck yes, we are."
"14268100","14269840"," Are we at the top over here?"
"14270120","14270860"," Yes, we are."
"14272180","14273500"," We're like right there. "
"14274520","14276380"," So a few ticks on a one minute chart."
"14276380","14277420"," Do you really need those?"
"14277680","14278280"," Probably not."
"14280880","14284140"," We'll be bounced down and continue higher. "
"14284500","14286560"," Maybe grab that 432 next week."
"14287100","14287240"," Possible."
"14287680","14288600"," Definitely possible. "
"14291980","14295240"," Roll this out right here and you get your final move into next week."
"14295360","14295960"," That's possible."
"14295960","14298540"," We can still go up on the daily up here. "
"14299920","14301760"," This is the spy, by the way."
"14303160","14304880"," So let's look at ES really quick."
"14309060","14310520"," See what that's telling us. "
"14311960","14314580"," Yes, man, right at the top of the key."
"14315800","14317440"," See that channel right there?"
"14317740","14319280"," ES telling us this is top."
"14320300","14320960"," This is it. "
"14323200","14327160"," ES trading 4-2-8-9-2-5 right now."
"14327360","14329640"," Starting to peek out on ES right now."
"14330120","14331820"," Like reaching for the top, right?"
"14334020","14334740"," Excuse me. "
"14335000","14335560"," SPX."
"14338640","14341000"," We know really what we're looking for, right?"
"14341180","14344380"," That 4-32-6 4-32-20 up here."
"14345060","14348700"," Look at that one big huge green bar right there. "
"14357870","14359630"," Climbing that wall of worry."
"14360530","14362630"," This is June 7th."
"14363130","14367990"," It could take us all the way to June 7th to get here on SPX. "
"14369550","14372770"," We could just grind from here into June 7th."
"14373790","14375610"," We could roll over from here."
"14379050","14380150"," Boom, there you go. "
"14380230","14381070"," You got to tag next week."
"14390030","14393810"," So just right here, you got your promise of Valhalla."
"14395030","14396290"," Does it happen today?"
"14397070","14398310"," Does it happen next week?"
"14402390","14405230"," Market saying it could happen today or next week. "
"14405910","14407410"," So we're at the top now."
"14407650","14418610"," So we're not top permanently, but start thinking about your next week where we build support"
"14418610","14420330"," to take out 4-40."
"14423950","14426890"," If we're going to take out 4-40, we need to start looking at that. "
"14428050","14431030"," If June is going to be sideways and up, we have to look at that."
"14431250","14431930"," If June is going to be sideways and up, we have to look at that."
"14431930","14433550"," If June is going to be a down month, we have to look at that. "
"14435250","14439080"," I mean, do you think that's sustainable?"
"14439660","14441320"," Oh, look at that fucking thing right there."
"14441940","14444280"," Do you think it's one, two, and three for Monday?"
"14445480","14446440"," Three bar green trade?"
"14446840","14448040"," One, two, and three?"
"14448740","14449680"," Or do they wrap it up today?"
"14450360","14452500"," Do you get that Monday push up?"
"14471920","14472800"," SPX baby."
"14475420","14477260"," I guess that didn't work for the Bears. "
"14477520","14478440"," Remember we put this one on?"
"14479080","14479940"," Remember this one?"
"14480620","14487360"," This is the one where I said they started here, then they went to here, and then they went to"
"14487360","14487640"," here."
"14487760","14488240"," Remember that?"
"14488600","14492940"," Remember someone on Fintuit had this one up and I was like, they're just moving it as we go up."
"14493820","14496080"," Next thing you know, it'll be something like that, right?"
"14497200","14498760"," This is what I was showing you people. "
"14498860","14503180"," This guy had 200,000 followers, 300,000 followers trying to run that ship into it."
"14503760","14504200"," Garbage."
"14508290","14512030"," SPX, reaching for the stars, baby. "
"14513510","14515850"," There's the gap on SPX right there."
"14545660","14547580"," Coming into it right now, right?"
"14547940","14549320"," There's an old gap left behind."
"14550840","14552020"," Let's see it right there. "
"14554000","14554920"," It's right there."
"14564430","14565450"," Let's see it right there."
"14568430","14572450"," Coming up into the gap right now, SPX, squeezing higher. "
"14575330","14577370"," What does spy need to do?"
"14580470","14583610"," Needs to touch this gap, maybe, maybe close it out."
"14583610","14585310"," We've got a gap down below here."
"14586630","14589430"," We know we've got this area down here to hold onto. "
"14607090","14608530"," Double top, right?"
"14608970","14613610"," We need to get above that so that we can go and fight for this stuff up here, right?"
"14614510","14617030"," How do you close this if you don't have a new high?"
"14618870","14625250"," SPX needs to close above 432.5.14, or it'll be a failure."
"14626610","14633730"," 432.14. If you want to close this shit up here, must close above."
"14637510","14638930"," SPX, baby. "
"14651590","14656010"," Spy, not quite participating like SPX is, is it?"
"14656710","14660110"," You've got these raging sell side people."
"14660430","14661290"," You've got these."
"14661770","14663950"," They're like, who's hedging?"
"14664690","14665310"," Who's hedging?"
"14665370","14666570"," Who's using spy as a hedge?"
"14666830","14668170"," Fucking funds and dealers. "
"14671930","14673130"," SPX participating."
"14677770","14679370"," Spy grinding higher."
"14679670","14681290"," When does the squeeze come on spy?"
"14681770","14683110"," When do we get the squeeze, baby?"
"14683610","14685650"," When does that squeeze come on spy?"
"14687290","14690130"," Spooze now 24, 28, 27. "
"14692680","14694090"," To the upside."
"14705890","14708880"," Spy printing all the calls."
"14726370","14727750"," Spoozing. "
"14729950","14735230"," I-W-M trading."
"14738710","14742690"," I'm going to have to, by the way, I'm going to exit my longs likely today in I-W-M."
"14742790","14743910"," Just let you know. "
"14746230","14748910"," I'm going to exit probably a ton of positions by the close today."
"14749110","14753810"," No, don't do that to me."
"14753930","14755930"," Don't say Monday 4th through 33 calls. "
"14756550","14759290"," Don't say that to me."
"14759290","14759750"," Yeah."
"14766230","14772670"," Melt up climbing the wall of worry on the spy right now. "
"14773350","14776450"," Going vertical into the bell."
"14777730","14781070"," We've got the previous gap from way back when?"
"14798190","14800890"," Talk about calling it to a tick, huh?"
"14801650","14804310"," Got people to base their whole careers on that shit."
"14804310","14814190"," We are now officially closing the gap above on 4285.91"
"14816030","14827410"," 430520 is the top of that gap on SPX 430 430520"
"14827410","14837370"," is the gap left on SPX 4325.14 is would be the new high to"
"14837370","14842730"," go and attempt to close 440s and 460s. "
"14846330","14847210"," Damn."
"14865790","14871070"," It's the market breath indicator by someone ran."
"14873930","14879860"," The algorithms in control right now. "
"14880280","14882180"," Congratulations to the bulls."
"14882180","14887100"," I told you we were going to 430, didn't I?"
"14891320","14892700"," I told you."
"14894220","14895340"," I told you. "
"14895340","14896700"," I told you."
"14899760","14901220"," We're close to it."
"14901520","14905440"," I didn't say exactly if I said 430, but here on stream I told you. "
"14905960","14908220"," Close enough poor hand grades and horseshoes, baby."
"14908220","14912880"," I think I said 4818 or something."
"14913240","14914200"," 4818. "
"14914620","14917420"," I think Winky had 46 something."
"14919780","14920960"," We're here."
"14921640","14922460"," Congratulations. "
"14924360","14926020"," Daddy got you there."
"14926140","14926460"," You're home."

"15103710","15106470"," There are other ways to donate, but they take money from me."
"15106550","15107030"," Tons of it. "
"15107170","15112170"," It's all like the hand in the pocket from these fucking companies."
"15118620","15122320"," You say you want performance based subs?"
"15123040","15124080"," Here's one for you."
"15131100","15135820"," Y'all pay people out there for subs and they don't tell you before what their trades are. "
"15137080","15138340"," Came the wrong sub."

"15153720","15154240"," What up Gil?"
"15156460","15157340"," Helm Hammerhand."
"15157580","15159860"," Thank you very much for supporting the stream. "
"15159900","15160720"," Hold on a second here."
"15183250","15188210"," We're going to spend some time reviewing people that have supported the stream this week."
"15189450","15192130"," I want to first say thank you to all of you for showing up. "
"15193230","15196710"," We're going to also go over what to expect next week."
"15197930","15201770"," So you know how you guys are always looking for videos from people as like what's going to happen"
"15201770","15202190"," next week?"
"15202190","15204510"," I do them every day here at three o'clock."
"15205170","15210130"," I go through exactly what to expect for tomorrow and into next week here. "
"15211990","15217170"," You don't have to wait until Sunday for some guy watching futures to give him his crystal ball."
"15218530","15220310"," I'll do it for you every day here."
"15220850","15222310"," At the bell I do it for you. "
"15225470","15229270"," I love all of you out there."
"15229570","15231630"," So a few things out there I want to talk to you guys about."
"15231630","15233990"," First off remember what I said earlier right?"
"15234170","15235150"," Price must hold. "
"15236070","15243550"," The yellow on the white line if it doesn't and begins to roll you cut your lungs and look to"
"15243550","15244330"," re-enter below."
"15245010","15246710"," It can come down here and bounce around."
"15246790","15247830"," It can do this goofiness. "
"15248930","15250450"," It has to come down and reject."
"15252370","15254370"," You might want to add to your long position."
"15255030","15256550"," You already know what's going on. "
"15256650","15262430"," You see this supply in the volatility where we are."
"15265630","15269950"," SPX is entering right now."
"15270490","15271150"," It's gap. "
"15271590","15273010"," It's sitting right now."
"15273210","15274110"," I'm going to show you this real quick."
"15279140","15280540"," This is SPX. "
"15283620","15286560"," So these three white lines right here."
"15286700","15288480"," This area right here."
"15289140","15291240"," This here is the gap. "
"15293700","15297000"," That's the gap for SPX from way way back way."
"15297120","15300840"," It's not going to be easy to grind through this."
"15301440","15302740"," Normally we hit a gap. "
"15303580","15304920"," We don't close it immediately."
"15305880","15308180"," Sometimes we ricochet down off of it."
"15309040","15314120"," When you hit a gap like this it's a grind to close it. "
"15316500","15317400"," It can take some work."
"15317580","15320460"," It might need the five minutes to come up to close all this gap here."
"15321140","15327680"," You also have not an all-time high but a new high so it's not a double top or a"
"15327680","15330100"," triple top or a quadruple top. "
"15330660","15340560"," The algos need to get up here whether today, tomorrow, or next week so that this trade is not"
"15340560","15341000"," dead."
"15342140","15342900"," To be aware of that."
"15343040","15345440"," We're coming into a place here of high volatility. "
"15346740","15351980"," Coming into a place where Southside wants to get in and sell this shit down."
"15352600","15355300"," If you're a collapse bear this is where you work."
"15356760","15358380"," This is where you do your work. "
"15359240","15360020"," If you're a seller."
"15361100","15365780"," If you're a fucking seller right and you've been calling point your fucking finger out there as a"
"15365780","15370720"," collapse or even a pullback or even a where the top for right now."
"15371140","15372280"," This is when you come to town. "
"15372460","15376560"," This is when you're like flexing your hands and you're like oh I'm ready to step on in."
"15377000","15378700"," I'm going to get myself a ratio spread up here."
"15379080","15380160"," I'm going to add some more to that ratio. "
"15380480","15381640"," I'm going to get really hard and heavy."
"15382100","15386560"," Ratio spread, put back spread or put spread and then I'm going short up here."
"15387340","15392620"," If we roll here you're going to get more aggressive with put spreads and then some shorts right"
"15392620","15392900"," here. "
"15393200","15393600"," Does that make sense?"
"15394500","15396220"," This is where you work."
"15396460","15397620"," This is where I'm checking out as a bull."
"15398280","15399360"," I'm checking out up in here. "
"15400140","15402280"," You're checking in on Southside."
"15403280","15404280"," Make sense to you?"
"15406460","15407880"," Be aware of that right there."
"15407960","15410680"," Get a nice little gap to close down below for a run higher too. "
"15415450","15418890"," Last Tuesday, this Tuesday morning at 7.30 in the morning."
"15420230","15423510"," I was chatting with wifey and he was like dude we just hit it."
"15423610","15424230"," I'm like dude I'm out. "
"15426170","15427170"," I'm like I'm fucking out."
"15427250","15428190"," I even put a tweet on Twitter."
"15428430","15428950"," I was like I'm done. "
"15428950","15429750"," Sell it."
"15430110","15430970"," Done out of here."
"15431550","15432990"," Wait for the next dip to buy. "
"15440610","15442090"," So we're coming into the end of the day."
"15442210","15445250"," I'm going to give you what to expect for next week, a general idea."
"15446050","15449350"," Normally I like to do it at 3 o'clock but it's 1.34 in the afternoon. "
"15449990","15452930"," Some of you are probably trying to take off and out of here so we'll take a look at it."
"15464170","15465350"," What do we know here?"
"15469810","15472630"," What does the crystal ball tell us here?"
"15472630","15483730"," It definitely tells us that"
"15483730","15485190"," we are way overbought."
"15485510","15486830"," Way way overbought. "
"15487210","15490230"," Somewhere up in here these sellers are up here."
"15490550","15491750"," I assure you of this."
"15492510","15495110"," These sellers are up here. "
"15498130","15507570"," For next week Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"15507570","15509450"," What else do we have going on?"
"15509810","15511430"," You tell me we've got what else we've got coming up."
"15511670","15512670"," F-O-M-C right?"
"15534540","15536040"," What do we have here right?"
"15536420","15536640"," No. "
"15537340","15537740"," No."
"15538700","15540040"," Break above the stretch."
"15541160","15544360"," What are bulls looking for next week right here?"
"15545760","15554580"," Bulls want out of this for 12 to 420 right?"
"15554580","15557260"," They broke above again to 430. "
"15558020","15559700"," What are bulls trying to hold?"
"15559920","15560220"," Do we know?"
"15560820","15561620"," 4 fucking 20."
"15563920","15566100"," That's all they care about right here."
"15567220","15568980"," They want to own 420. "
"15571060","15574140"," This is bull smart money by the dip down here."
"15576680","15580940"," This is bulls exiting calls right?"
"15581740","15582460"," Watch me right here."
"15590400","15592400"," What do we got up there?"
"15592680","15593020"," What's this?"
"15597610","15598450"," What's that baby?"
"15598850","15599890"," 441-443. "
"15602730","15604750"," What are you focused on next week?"
"15605650","15606170"," Tell you."
"15607970","15609790"," Focused on buying the dip down here."
"15610430","15612070"," Focused on selling the rip up here. "
"15612210","15613770"," You focused on buying the dip up here."
"15613870","15615430"," Focused on selling the rip up here."
"15616170","15617890"," This is your whole focus next week. "
"15623670","15627670"," Bulls in the end of today are trying to get up here and at least get up there right?"
"15627910","15629010"," Oh yeah we're getting up there."
"15630290","15631750"," That's not the big move is it?"
"15631930","15633350"," Big move is down here wasn't it?"
"15639350","15644010"," Bulls want to hold 420 so they can get up here and do 443."
"15646830","15647230"," 450. "
"15647230","15647630"," 34."
"15648050","15649190"," I haven't done the 60s yet."
"15654010","15654930"," You get it?"
"15656310","15658770"," Where do bulls want to buy a fat dip?"
"15663610","15664970"," Where do I want to buy a dip?"
"15665030","15667190"," If you want to know where I want to buy a dip I'll tell you where I want to buy"
"15667190","15667430"," a dip. "

"15678440","15690770"," Next week it'll be 416. "
"15693110","15693630"," 417."
"15695510","15699090"," This is where Old Van Johnson wants to buy next week right here."
"15699950","15701270"," I want that dip. "
"15701890","15702670"," Mark my words."
"15703650","15705530"," It's a fair chance we come down here."
"15707150","15708650"," Even for a brief moment. "
"15709610","15713870"," I want to buy this like 416-417 area right here."
"15713970","15714530"," That's what I want to buy."
"15723020","15724400"," Can you withstand that?"
"15724540","15731020"," You want to buy this down here and we can make a run and hold all this shit up here. "
"15731900","15733680"," Is there a dip by down below here?"
"15733840","15734940"," Fuck yeah there is right here."
"15735140","15735540"," 421."
"15741810","15747210"," So for next week coming into Friday if we squeeze up here in a close hell yeah we can. "
"15748270","15751830"," We sell off into the bell to get clean all these calls and then wiggle our way up there."
"15751910","15752110"," Sure."
"15752710","15753630"," Can it happen next week?"
"15753670","15753930"," Sure. "
"15754390","15756790"," Where am I buying a dip with money?"
"15757510","15758610"," For right now it's down here."
"15759950","15760950"," 421-420."
"15761910","15762630"," That's where I'm buying. "
"15763630","15767850"," Old dirty dog swellers up here telling you fuck no you're not getting up here."
"15768550","15772210"," You can go close that gap on SPX asshole but you're not doing it in the spy."
"15772890","15775290"," We're going to slam you down on spy specifically. "
"15794540","15796820"," Right in there you see it BAM."
"15801240","15802140"," BAM BAM."
"15803220","15804220"," See it right there?"
"15805940","15815900"," If we don't do this and we get above I'll take that trade we ain't up there right"
"15815900","15816500"," now are we?"
"15817540","15824720"," If we get under here and we have a failure to close above we know we're heading down right?"
"15826120","15827600"," So this here is a trade. "
"15828840","15830160"," This is a trade."
"15831360","15833020"," This is no man's land right?"
"15834700","15835580"," For next week."
"15840350","15842730"," So that's what you have to look forward to next week. "
"15843530","15848210"," If you're one of those guys or one of those gals out there that's like cap can we get down"
"15848210","15849510"," and have a market crash in June?"
"15851070","15852090"," Fuck you no."
"15852610","15857910"," You have to trade every zone all the way down until you get a major role."
"15858910","15869730"," Until you see until"
"15869730","15873870"," you see this right here in a daily chart the answer is fuck you no. "
"15877930","15879270"," I'll show you that right here."
"15879470","15885810"," That's me saying to you that's where capy's buying the dip with stops underneath it."
"15888390","15891630"," If we blast through capy cuts fucking loose right?"
"15891950","15900010"," Oh shit bloodbath gasp for air and then boom that's the short. "
"15901410","15902310"," Does that make sense?"
"15903610","15904370"," See it now?"
"15907050","15908010"," Fairly easy right?"
"15909490","15911050"," So can you call that market crash?"
"15911350","15912170"," Fuck no you can't."
"15912730","15918830"," You're waiting for me to buy a dip and have it fail down here at 4.15, 4.16. You"
"15918830","15919090"," get it?"
"15919530","15920270"," So you trade each level."
"15920650","15922010"," 1, 2, 3."
"15923570","15924170"," Let off the gas. "
"15924170","15926110"," Come for the big move down."
"15926930","15928710"," Call your big down move for June."
"15929470","15930950"," We ain't there yet though are we?"
"15931850","15935030"," Can't be out there calling shit if it isn't real. "
"15940150","15951560"," Bear cross on the 1 minute chart target down below 4.27.59. I'm"
"15951560","15953620"," going to go back and show you that one more time."
"15969790","15971790"," You can take a snip of that if you want."
"15973550","15978550"," Just do a quick snip on your camera or your phone or whatever your computer at home. "
"15980290","15981190"," Where are bulls?"
"15981670","15982990"," Where's smart money trying to buy?"
"15983150","15983870"," Where am I trying to buy?"
"15984750","15985830"," I'm trying to buy it down here."
"15986970","15989210"," I'm really trying to buy it down here for next week."
"15990090","15993770"," And I will buy this if we get above it if it consolidates. "
"15996130","15997890"," What are bull bears trying to choose?"
"15998350","15998850"," Sell right here."
"15999130","15999810"," Sell right here."
"16000090","16000670"," Sell right here. "
"16001250","16002250"," Calm this down."
"16007540","16011920"," Have the bulls say yes we're going higher than 430."
"16013540","16015900"," Have the bulls they have to show up. "
"16016620","16018800"," They don't show up we ain't going up."
"16019400","16028220"," Bulls need to believe that we're going to not 432 to 441, 443."
"16029140","16030720"," They have to know that we're going there. "
"16031600","16033660"," Bears have to know that we're going there."
"16033960","16037540"," Sellers, buyers, need to know that we're going there."
"16038180","16041960"," And need to show that they're willing to buy more to get there. "
"16043240","16045040"," So there's your plan for next week."
"16045940","16046960"," Fairly easy right?"
"16053450","16054610"," You guys all understand?"
"16055570","16057470"," And I want to show you one more thing here."
"16061710","16068310"," Regardless of what anyone is telling you out there, anybody I don't give a fuck who they are. "
"16068990","16069910"," I'll be honest with you."
"16070010","16071070"," I give a flying fuck."
"16072470","16074510"," But what anybody out there is telling you. "
"16075710","16079470"," Literally when you guys tell me shit I'm like I give a flying fuck what they're telling you."
"16080530","16081730"," Honest, I'll be honest with you."
"16082330","16084250"," I'll tell you why because real money's in the line. "
"16085050","16088850"," And right up here even if we go up, this is where I sell right here."
"16091030","16092990"," And I'm trying to buy down here."
"16093190","16094250"," See this green coming down?"
"16094550","16095550"," See this green coming down?"
"16095550","16097950"," This is what I'm entering down here. "
"16098690","16104670"," So until we're back down there again, I'll sit in my fucking hand."
"16104830","16105670"," I'll day trade with you."
"16105990","16111530"," But I'm going to sit on my hands until that perfect condition comes back around again. "
"16113690","16118830"," This is what I mean by I could literally turn this stream off and just come back in like a"
"16118830","16122850"," month or two weeks or a week or whatever that happened in that perfect condition."
"16124010","16127390"," I'll text you on the phone and I will say Trend Day."
"16131000","16133900"," So no matter where we are, no matter where we close up here, I don't care. "
"16134100","16135340"," I'm looking for the perfect condition."
"16142100","16143900"," I want to be a fucking gangster."
"16146180","16147420"," I want to be a badass. "
"16153590","16155890"," I want to pay the bills for my kids and my wife."
"16157490","16159410"," I want to keep the lights on for you."
"16159430","16166130"," I want to keep the internet on so you guys have me with fiber optic and all that shit. "
"16167990","16171410"," I got the goddamn dogs that cost me fucking $300 a month."
"16171670","16172330"," Take them to the vet."
"16173350","16174770"," I got mortgages and taxes. "
"16176550","16177930"," I got people out there."
"16178030","16181310"," I got people out of person a convenience store asked me for a tip the other day."
"16181310","16182790"," I got to tip that person. "
"16190190","16194270"," We're living in what a time when people aren't getting paid in a tie with high inflation."
"16195330","16197790"," You better be waiting for that dip down below if you're a bully."
"16197830","16198270"," Get me?"
"16199130","16200410"," Wait for the right time. "
"16205290","16206630"," So can we go up here?"
"16206830","16207970"," Fuck yeah, this trade's not dead."
"16210330","16212330"," This is all this stuff in here."
"16213010","16218010"," All this stuff in here right now is like dealers, right?"
"16218690","16220750"," You get algorithms that you do what they need to do. "
"16221130","16223710"," You get dealers that are like, we're not fucking paying you, dude."
"16224110","16224670"," We're not getting paid."
"16224830","16225250"," We'll go there. "
"16225590","16226330"," We're not paying you."
"16226570","16228450"," You got sell side coming in right now."
"16229050","16230910"," And they're just like revenge, revenge, revenge. "
"16231610","16233510"," I'm making it up like a story like a fable."
"16233650","16234510"," They're not doing revenge trading."
"16235010","16236990"," But they know that this is where they sell. "
"16237270","16237710"," They know this."
"16237710","16239730"," They know that they take a position here."
"16241450","16245630"," I can promise you that retail does not do that on bottoms. "
"16246890","16249510"," Like professionals are like, we're going to sell this right here."
"16250150","16252730"," You know what retail does on the bottom, retail bulls?"
"16253330","16254310"," They don't fucking buy."
"16255650","16258630"," They watch me buy and they watch it go up. "
"16259230","16261230"," And then we're up here at 4.30. You know what they say to me?"
"16262130","16263570"," I'm fucking buying, Capy."
"16265330","16272430"," I'm buying 4.33s. I'm buying fucking 4.35. I'm buying 4.40s. They wait until the whole fucking move"
"16272430","16272830"," is done."
"16272970","16273550"," Then they take it. "
"16274130","16279230"," When we're down on the dumpster and the dumpster fucking fire in the behind Wendy's and I'm going,"
"16279590","16281670"," it's time to close your fucking shorts."
"16283290","16285130"," It's time to close your fucking puts."
"16286410","16291910"," What are you, are you closing before Friday or whatever day it is Wednesday at 4 p.m. and I"
"16291910","16294030"," got people in this stream that are like, fuck gnomed. "
"16294650","16295590"," I'm chasing that hole."
"16295830","16296650"," I'm going to become the hole."
"16297750","16301510"," And I got bulls on the other side saying, fuck no ain't buying that. "
"16301630","16302550"," Look at those bears over there."
"16303290","16304270"," They say we're going to crash."
"16304950","16308650"," So I got like, bears trying to fucking go deeper than they should be. "
"16309130","16311050"," And I got bulls not trying to buy a dip."
"16311330","16311750"," Retailers."
"16313050","16317890"," So meanwhile up here right now at this top the professionals are like, I'm fucking selling this"
"16317890","16318150"," shit. "
"16318890","16321650"," I'm telling you should be closing your lungs here."
"16321810","16324150"," We now and this 4.32 or whatever."
"16324470","16328610"," You can day trade this shit for five minutes or rest of the day, but we're getting there. "
"16329690","16331110"," Are we going up to 4.40?"
"16331450","16332170"," Fuck yeah, probably."
"16333030","16334090"," Right now it says that we are."
"16336670","16338450"," But I want you to know that in the stream, okay. "
"16339510","16340590"," You got to know that in the stream."
"16340690","16343170"," You had to have an awareness of where the market is."
"16343810","16347190"," I don't want you to have an awareness of where the sellers are, the buyers are. "
"16350590","16352010"," Yeah, trade the bills, baby."
"16352390","16353030"," Trade the bills."
"16353370","16354090"," That's what I just called it. "
"16354270","16355410"," Trade the bills."
"16359330","16362390"," So if you're getting, so I want you to know something right where we are right now."
"16363410","16368610"," If you right now are feeling extremely bullish. "
"16370250","16371970"," You're in the wrong, even if we go there."
"16371970","16372910"," You're in the fucking wrong."
"16372910","16375010"," You should not be feeling extremely bullish here. "
"16375650","16378410"," You should just start getting bearish, even if it's only momentarily."
"16379710","16382430"," If you're a bear and you're feeling bullish, you definitely."
"16383050","16385009"," This is the time that you start getting bearish. "
"16385890","16390930"," Even if we go up, I want you to know you're watching this stream and you're a retailer."
"16393250","16394770"," This is when you get bearish."
"16398250","16400970"," If you're a bull, this is when you start getting bearish. "
"16403130","16406310"," If you're a bull, you should begin to start thinking about wrapping it up."
"16415169","16418450"," Not forever, but you know, like a few days we get up there."
"16418550","16423210"," We hit three, slap that four 32 and SPX bounce around, just start wrapping it up. "
"16425610","16426509"," You can wrap it up."
"16426710","16428050"," Now you can take the majority of the mood."
"16428050","16429790"," You want to be a baller out there. "
"16432529","16437349"," You want to be a great trader, then you're not facing this dilemma here."
"16438610","16439570"," Because you bought the dip."
"16443930","16448590"," If you're a sell side guy, you know when to sell. "
"16449650","16451009"," You're not stressing this."
"16454800","16458480"," The only people stressing where we are right now are people that."
"16459700","16460759"," Didn't buy the dip. "
"16461660","16464720"," And people that shorted it the whole way up at the wrong time."
"16466259","16468680"," Or held short too long, whatever that is."
"16469060","16472200"," Those are the people that are going to be in a coffin in your air. "
"16474240","16477700"," So whenever you're listening to people right now that are bullish."
"16478599","16479919"," This next few days."
"16481240","16486080"," They're likely the FOMO chasers or they got torch the whole way up. "
"16487460","16488880"," Generally, that's who those people are."
"16492310","16495450"," And when we're at a bottom and you see people trying to buy a dip."
"16496369","16499630"," You should be looking at those people when we're most bearish. "
"16501250","16504330"," You should be looking around for the one or two or three people."
"16504910","16508130"," They're like I'm not the people that are like I bought the dip, bought the dip, bought the dip the"
"16508130","16508470"," whole way down."
"16508810","16512509"," Like that one person that's down there at the bottom when everything's on fucking fire. "
"16513169","16515730"," And you're like that guy over there knows the fuck he's doing."
"16516430","16518630"," Especially if you're a person closing your shorts."
"16520009","16522610"," And you're like I want to close my shorts and making a ton of money. "
"16522970","16526050"," Is there anybody out there that only is down here buying the fucking dip."
"16526470","16527630"," That person you follow."
"16529930","16534450"," Stop following these fucking people out there with a million fucking subs and shit selling a"
"16534450","16535570"," service and all that kind of shit. "
"16536630","16541029"," They're doing that shit for you to like hit your emotions."
"16541509","16542890"," Like there's always ulterior motive."
"16550050","16552810"," Now people hate me when I go in these rants and we're at tops and bottoms. "
"16552890","16553570"," I'm going to do it."
"16559320","16560300"," Definitely going to do it."
"16560800","16562720"," So can we close this here today?"
"16563340","16564460"," Yes, we can. "
"16565520","16567660"," Are they going to torture calls on the way up?"
"16567900","16568599"," Yes, they will."
"16571800","16575360"," Do you want to capture it not by a five cent call for the close?"
"16575680","16576419"," No, you can do that."
"16577439","16579520"," You can definitely throw a five cent call on there. "
"16580400","16583480"," You probably made money all the way up and you don't care if they burn."
"16584900","16589300"," You can put cheap puts in cheap calls here just to straddle into the clothes here."
"16589580","16591599"," You just a strangle into the clothes here. "
"16593060","16596640"," You get something like a 30 delta going up and a 30 delta going down."
"16596860","16599880"," 30 delta put, 30 delta call, 50 delta."
"16600160","16601960"," You can go 50 if you want to both sides. "
"16603680","16604400"," Let them ride, baby."
"16605360","16606880"," You don't have to be a rocket scientist."
"16610380","16613439"," You don't have to be out there sticking your finger out there saying this is the top. "
"16613840","16614919"," This is the bottom."
"16616860","16618060"," This is where we're going to crash."
"16618500","16620720"," I mean do I think we're going to 450?"
"16621240","16621500"," I do. "
"16621880","16622520"," Right now I do."
"16623560","16626200"," Right now the market says yes we are going to 450."
"16626720","16628140"," Well the market says we're going to 440. "
"16629140","16630360"," That's what the market says."
"16630660","16631540"," Now if we roll over."
"16632460","16633939"," I'll be on fucking bear time with you. "
"16634480","16636080"," I'll chase it right down with you promise."
"16641860","16642919"," So for next week."
"16644619","16645860"," Looking to buy a dip. "
"16648259","16649119"," Down at 420."
"16649919","16655160"," Possibly as deep as 416 or 17 next week."
"16661900","16666599"," A genuine question if a person is making money with trading why do they need a bunch followers on"
"16666599","16666939"," Twitter. "
"16667779","16668720"," So I didn't have followers."
"16668980","16671820"," If you want to know about me personally I didn't have followers on Twitter."
"16672580","16673640"," I was from Wall Street Bats. "
"16673820","16676140"," I was trained by real professionals."
"16677020","16679240"," That were hiding out in Wall Street Bats."
"16679380","16680320"," They taught me how to be a trader. "
"16681080","16682580"," That's the that's the simple story."
"16682599","16684020"," I was a trainer before that by sucked."
"16685279","16687240"," Wall Street Bats became a different place. "
"16687660","16691919"," It became really fucked up as a retail traders got involved in the fucking market."
"16692580","16693840"," And so it just became a different thing."
"16694060","16694419"," People fled. "
"16694759","16695779"," They moved over to Twitter."
"16696720","16700960"," Some of the last people to get to Twitter were guys like me guys like horse lover fat."
"16702020","16706040"," There's a bunch of us on Twitter that came over the last crew of people that came over from. "
"16707779","16709520"," From Wall Street Bats to Twitter."
"16709939","16710779"," So we moved over there."
"16711759","16712900"," I didn't have any followers. "
"16713220","16717400"," A bunch of people in this stream right here have known me since I had zero followers."
"16718400","16723200"," And I became frustrated with watching people losing their asses in the market."
"16724220","16724980"," Like frustrated. "
"16725460","16729840"," Like pained me to see my friends getting their fucking asses handed to them."
"16736580","16737580"," So what did I do?"
"16737820","16739040"," I just spent time with my friends."
"16739040","16741700"," Like there's people in this stream that I spent time with. "
"16742080","16743279"," Hours on the phone."
"16744660","16747419"," And then one day I got pissed off and was like I'm going to make some videos."
"16748020","16749640"," And then I'm like fuck this I'm going to start streaming. "
"16751360","16753500"," And then of course the community grew."
"16753919","16755860"," And now it needs to be supported."
"16757099","16758720"," Now the high follower counts people. "
"16759480","16760660"," There's ways for me to get."
"16760820","16763000"," So I can get a hundred thousand followers in a minute."
"16764140","16766119"," If I played nice on Twitter. "
"16766680","16767660"," I'd have a hundred thousand followers."
"16768380","16771259"," If I did doom content on Twitter I could have."
"16771460","16772580"," If I did anything. "
"16773400","16777080"," Like I hate these people and I hate those people like real real nasty stuff."
"16777300","16778840"," I have a friend here."
"16779140","16784700"," I have a friend of ours of this of this program that intentionally makes Twitter accounts. "
"16785880","16789460"," And he intentionally engages people to grow followers."
"16790220","16795360"," And he'll grow like 50, 60, 70 hundred thousand followers in like three months."
"16796000","16798640"," And he does it mostly to test the system. "
"16799200","16801020"," Like what gets you followers on Twitter."
"16801840","16806480"," He's a scientist and so he wants to make sure he wants to know how you gain followers on Twitter."
"16806660","16807340"," That's his base case. "
"16808180","16811620"," And so he tries different tactics on Twitter how to get followers."
"16812660","16818600"," And people gain followers intentionally so they can sell services or push a thesis."
"16819780","16823220"," Some of them are bots and you don't even know it you think they're real people or their own"
"16823220","16823620"," accounts. "
"16824120","16826040"," Like I sell you my account."
"16827280","16832920"," I buy like 10 accounts that are bearish or 10 accounts that are bullish or I'm selling NFTs."
"16833120","16834520"," You don't know what some of these people are doing. "
"16835500","16837720"," You know and then we push narratives right."
"16837980","16839460"," I don't do that but that's what happens."
"16840340","16841980"," And to be honest I don't have a lot of followers. "
"16842100","16843800"," If you think I have a lot of followers I don't."
"16844440","16845960"," 17,000 followers is nothing."
"16847520","16849140"," And there's a reason for that. "
"16849360","16851040"," I piss people off in the right way."
"16852520","16854240"," Intentionally don't want a lot of followers."
"16859750","16865670"," I hit the buttons of the people that if I was to just placate them and not I made certain"
"16865670","16866610"," people feel good. "
"16867470","16868910"," I'd have a hundred thousand followers."
"16869070","16869830"," I'm not trying to do that."
"16891020","16891920"," Thanks Mark and merchant. "
"16894240","16896060"," I like you being here brother."
"16896240","16897100"," I think you're great by the way."
"16898960","16902860"," And so this is turned into just so the further to further this. "
"16903440","16908480"," This show has turned into more of a companion piece."
"16909300","16911600"," Rather than try to complicate things."
"16912660","16915180"," Like I could come on here with a script every day right. "
"16915440","16918080"," And I could say shit to you that you'd be like what the fuck is he saying."
"16920060","16924900"," You guys really want me here coming in here and telling you something that's not easily digestible."
"16925680","16929440"," You guys want me coming into these fucking streams and telling you shit that might not be"
"16929440","16929700"," applicable. "
"16931040","16933100"," I'm going to talk about archaic subjects I can."
"16933580","16934800"," I don't know that this is that show."
"16935380","16937020"," When I was when I was trading right. "
"16937520","16939420"," I was always looking for one specific thing."
"16940420","16941780"," That I could never find."
"16942500","16946240"," Like I saw a lot of different like I was like one thing that I wanted was for me. "
"16946380","16951760"," So I bought all the services paid all the alpha people paid for the discord thousand dollars here"
"16951760","16953480"," thousand bucks there tried everything."
"16953960","16955460"," Flow services you name it."
"16955660","16956800"," You fucking name it I tried it. "
"16956800","16960860"," I had the best book map you could get anything tried at all."
"16975130","16978530"," Sorry I got to manage my trades here."
"16981510","16983150"," So I used to do all that stuff right. "
"16984590","16991270"," And the one thing that I was always missing was I would like so I'd have access to alphas right"
"16991270","16992730"," like people that trade it every day."
"16995590","16997690"," But I never had like a training partner."
"16999670","17001430"," And that was another side of it. "
"17001490","17006630"," It was like I pay for an alphan each up one day a week show up only at the most"
"17006630","17007350"," perfect times."
"17008010","17009710"," So I'd be like well I don't need that guy."
"17010610","17014290"," Like I don't need that guy to show up and I know that he knows what the best times to"
"17014290","17016690"," sell are and I know that he knows the best time the buys are. "
"17017010","17018370"," But it's the other times."
"17019930","17021330"," Where I'm like out there alone."
"17021790","17027290"," So like I'm a trader and when you ever notice when you pay for an alphan if you get you"
"17027290","17029950"," guys notices or not when you guys pay for like alphas and shit. "

"18026110","18029430"," This new high up here if we trade this up here right. "
"18030190","18031450"," We're able to trade this."
"18032230","18033810"," You should see VIX."
"18035010","18040570"," Begin to trade down closer to between ten dollars and twenty dollars. "
"18042030","18045450"," That would imply that we're going to trade for forty."
"18046070","18047750"," That's a more normalized market."
"18048150","18049090"," So just be aware of that. "
"18049330","18054190"," Why not get down to ten and make it down to like twelve dollars twelve fifty somewhere in there."
"18055410","18060230"," It's going to imply man that that vol is leaving and we're going to trade for forty."
"18060630","18065450"," So it'll be interesting here to see what happens into this close. "
"18066270","18069190"," It's going to be an import like today tomorrow is going to be pretty important."
"18069970","18075530"," It's going to give you an implication of even if we roll over an implication of volatility leaving"
"18075530","18076290"," the market."
"18077130","18082370"," I want you to also note that if volatility does leave the market. "
"18083910","18087930"," And we are if we are going to trade those for the four forty and the four fifty."
"18088950","18092210"," You will see a market that trades slow more slowly."
"18092990","18095710"," You'll still see volatility and downside moves. "
"18096230","18098470"," But you'll see the move higher take longer."
"18099530","18101010"," Normally it won't be violent."
"18101010","18104510"," On the upside it'll be something a little bit more sideways and up. "
"18105390","18106830"," That will take some time."
"18107950","18111630"," As volatility leaves the market if we reprice the VIX things like that."
"18112510","18116370"," You shouldn't see it should be violent but not as violent as I think you expect. "
"18117270","18119410"," Just pay attention to that into this close."
"18120450","18124110"," Pay attention to it on Monday and Tuesday and even into next week."
"18124370","18128530"," If it takes us in the next week to get up there if we fail to get up there. "
"18128950","18130730"," That's a big bad that's bad right."
"18131950","18135870"," We want to at least get up there and get up there that four thirty that four thirty two."
"18136310","18137590"," I want you to know that. "
"18138090","18143410"," If you're failing bearish failure to get there that four thirty four thirty two by."
"18144430","18147570"," End of June is not going to be good."
"18147570","18148970"," It's not healthy to see that. "
"18150990","18153610"," It's going to point the way down."
"18155030","18160750"," So we want to see continuation for the bulls if they're going to trade four forty."
"18161450","18162670"," If they're going to trade for fifty. "
"18163510","18167750"," If at any point the bulls lose the will to do that."
"18168460","18172210"," That could be anything right could be the fed with a hawkish tone."
"18173010","18174710"," Could be an outside. "
"18176250","18181890"," Now the markets volatility event could be commercial real estate and that kind of stuff."
"18182270","18183450"," So if the way is up."
"18184110","18186170"," Be paying attention to the VIX. "
"18186750","18190730"," Be paying attention due to do we get the new high."
"18191410","18195970"," Do we close the gap of like these are things bulls are looking for."
"18195970","18197350"," They want to see. "
"18198110","18200990"," They want to see if that stuff gets gets closed out."
"18201650","18202570"," For continuation."
"18203430","18203650"," Higher. "
"18217840","18222640"," Yeah I want you to like just just be a like just be market aware of this stuff."
"18222880","18225380"," You don't really have to pay attention to too many people."
"18225480","18228560"," I mean you got I like that you guys have your favorite traders. "
"18229040","18231480"," Your favorite investors your favorite macro guys."
"18231680","18232860"," But I want you and your own."
"18233900","18235780"," To note those things. "
"18236800","18238020"," Because they're like a future."
"18238200","18238800"," They're like a few."
"18238880","18239820"," They're telling you the future. "
"18240140","18241640"," Now that future can change."
"18243000","18247520"," You know like when you get forecasts from people that give you like a year out volatility forecast."
"18247920","18248620"," It's bullshit. "
"18249120","18251300"," As always he'll tell you Scott will tell you'll say."
"18251820","18253860"," You know what those forecasts are they're garbage."
"18254600","18256160"," He's like the next month out. "
"18256440","18257340"," Yeah we can track that."
"18257720","18258820"," Next two months out."
"18259000","18259880"," Yeah we can track that. "
"18262000","18264640"," Look look him up volatility was he'll tell you the same thing."
"18264660","18265280"," It's all bullshit."
"18265540","18269140"," So you on your own need to paying attention to. "
"18269940","18273200"," Do the bull or do buyers have the will to go higher."
"18274040","18276920"," Do the by are the buyers losing the will to go higher."
"18279420","18282020"," Been to it's a really bad place to see that. "
"18283320","18284800"," You can see it in VIX."
"18284980","18286980"," You can see it in vol you can see it in price."
"18288100","18290940"," You want to pay attention to those things like do we get a new high. "
"18291060","18292280"," Do we not get a new new high."
"18293160","18295500"," Do we get a new low right on what time frame is it."
"18296380","18298580"," The bill of the bulls kind of floundering here. "
"18302300","18303960"," You just want to be aware of that stuff."
"18327910","18329070"," You have a bullish bias."
"18329290","18330210"," I have a bullish bias too. "
"18330470","18330870"," I'm bull."
"18331110","18332290"," I think that enough thing."
"18332770","18334570"," My view is that we get up here. "
"18335550","18336870"," Either today or tomorrow."
"18336870","18339810"," Not tomorrow, but like Monday or next week something like that."
"18339950","18340350"," We'll get up here. "
"18340890","18342190"," We can do the creepy crawl in the close."
"18342430","18343110"," We could do it right now."
"18343130","18344330"," We could do it tomorrow or Monday. "
"18346070","18347090"," We're already here, right?"
"18347270","18348230"," Might as well just close them out."
"18348990","18349650"," Close them out."
"18349710","18350210"," Roll it over. "
"18350850","18351510"," Find some support."
"18356020","18357740"," Find out where the buyers are, right?"
"18363300","18365720"," Do we need a new low by the bottom of the hour?"
"18366300","18366700"," Yeah, 230."
"18368340","18370800"," So they got a new low where the five in right now. "
"18373620","18374620"," I wasn't paying attention."
"18375800","18377360"," Yeah, they need a new low right here."
"18377480","18377640"," 230. "
"18379400","18381220"," You guys ever notice we got a big move at 240?"
"18381660","18383220"," You guys never noticed that like 240 in the afternoon."
"18383220","18384220"," We got a big giant move."
"18387300","18389040"," 240 in the afternoon right around there. "
"18390940","18391900"," Yeah, they need a new low."
"18392560","18394520"," And they need to break below this right here by 240."
"18396580","18399340"," Buyers are saying they're still in charge of the five minute right now. "
"18408090","18409030"," Yeah, I don't care."
"18409330","18410010"," Like China aggression."
"18410910","18413230"," The more China aggression, the better off we are. "
"18414710","18417290"," I've told you guys this in the past, I'm going to tell you again."
"18417430","18418330"," Okay, it's disgusting."
"18418790","18423590"," But if you know anything about short and long term debt cycles. "
"18424370","18429830"," There was a time in the world where we didn't have a lot of technology and smart people."
"18430930","18435210"," So we fought actual wars and we've become very good."
"18436090","18440190"," At fighting wars through proxy with poor nations. "
"18441650","18445390"," So if we're in a debt side part of the debt side where we're in a recession."
"18447130","18447650"," Right."
"18447870","18449890"," There are things to look for right. "
"18450590","18451470"," Civil unrest."
"18452110","18453870"," We've seen that right in our own country."
"18454690","18456910"," You see people fighting with each other. "
"18457070","18457430"," You see."
"18458990","18460190"," You know, like you like."
"18461530","18463690"," What's portrayed right now amongst people, right?"
"18463690","18466730"," You've got Jack booted Nazi and you've got. "
"18470290","18476770"," You've got people portrayed as as being transgender that are with guns and stuff."
"18476810","18477390"," It's not real."
"18477510","18478090"," It's not true. "
"18480070","18481650"," We hang out with those people."
"18481830","18483390"," I'm sure you have people that are."
"18486150","18487730"," Gay that you know, right?"
"18488010","18492130"," I'm sure that you know a person of color or a woman or whatever. "
"18493150","18496850"," I'm sure that you know a conservative person in your family."
"18497550","18501130"," I got to know some of them are assholes or some of them are loud on either side, right?"
"18501250","18503290"," But then most normal people aren't those people."
"18503650","18510650"," But I want you to be keyed in on civil strife, civil disorder shows that we're in that recessionary"
"18510650","18510890"," period. "
"18511550","18515670"," You see taxes being increased on people."
"18516430","18520190"," You see taxes being proposed and increased on corporations."
"18520190","18526210"," And one of the other signs of recessionary times are wars. "
"18527330","18531170"," Now today we don't fight those wars like we once did."
"18531870","18538270"," And the more that we fight a war towards the end of a short or long term death cycle helps"
"18538270","18544030"," to blunt the recessionary pressures from that part of the cycle."
"18544030","18553550"," So right now when you see the US fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine is likely due to"
"18553550","18559850"," these two major superpowers wanting to blunt recessionary pressures in their own countries. "
"18559850","18567750"," When you see the US and China not getting along is very similar as well helps with the war complex,"
"18567850","18577090"," helps with the GDP of all of these major nations to blunt"
"18577090","18579850"," recessions because they all printed money."
"18580770","18589230"," Tastately behind a closed door, all of these nations are likely implicit in wanting to wage some"
"18589230","18597950"," kind of war footing or war some kind of proxy war so that they can blunt recessions without"
"18597950","18599470"," actually fighting a war."
"18600630","18604710"," It would never shock me if we were once we exit this recession, right?"
"18605850","18613370"," Once we exit this, I assure you you will see relations between these nations improved. "
"18614450","18619550"," It's kind of weird, but you'll see that you'll see like resolutions come into play once these"
"18619550","18622110"," recessions, we exit these recessions."
"18629570","18638360"," So when you hear things like in your mind you think, yeah war ramping with China."
"18638360","18641460"," I think the opposite thought in your head. "
"18642120","18645560"," The kid you not it's actually I mean actual war is not good."
"18646100","18648580"," Our stock market will crash if we go to war with China."
"18649280","18653540"," Our stock market can go down with just like Ukraine Ukraine and Russia, right?"
"18654000","18655960"," But it's like a shot in the arm, right?"
"18656140","18659340"," You're like taking a shot to hurt a pain that you have. "
"18662080","18666640"," It's kind of crazy to say that it's not it's gross because human lives are lost."
"18667960","18673840"," It's not a good thing, but you expect these things to happen when you're in these environments."
"18674840","18677260"," You have your eyes out for them happening in the background. "
"18680340","18687800"," If China U.S. aggressions are heated, that means that we're we're putting more people to work."
"18688440","18695240"," You know that like that that's like counter to the argument that GDP is going to go down."
"18704950","18711490"," A lot of the things that we think are like bullish or bearish are the opposite. "
"18714070","18714630"," Oftentimes."
"18738180","18828420"," You had"
"18828420","18829400"," no markets are cut or two."
"18830500","18833000"," Would alien contact be bullish or bearish?"
"18839880","18841840"," It depends how much they hate doves. "
"18842600","18846920"," Why don't you guys let me know in the chat."
"18848040","18852460"," What your thoughts are on the Fed."
"18853800","18857420"," Do you think that we pause for summer?"
"18858660","18860940"," Do you think we get 25 BPS?"
"18861440","18862900"," Do you think we get 50 BPS?"
"18863380","18866400"," Start the conversation with pause 25. "
"18867130","18872620"," You could do cuts if you wanted to cuts pause 25 50 and then your discussion."
"18873460","18877080"," Like pause because of this 25 because of this."
"18878480","18880340"," Everybody's on 25 right now, huh?"

"18903390","18905430"," So someone just answered a good answer right there. "
"18905930","18907390"," Someone just gave a very good answer."
"18908410","18911870"," Spy holding its five minute trigger trying to go higher."
"18913210","18916570"," Trading for 28 15 yesterday. "
"18917450","18918610"," We went up here."
"18919670","18921530"," And then sold off, right?"
"18922150","18925110"," Remember we said we're going sideways into the bell going down to the red."
"18927050","18933350"," We had yesterday we had a poll if we're going to trade sideways, go down or go up. "
"18934130","18937670"," We all picked up, but then we said we closed there."
"18938470","18941230"," Once we got there, we went down and did the red close."
"18942410","18946650"," They just came swoop it in the dealers and they said thank you for playing. "
"18949390","18951010"," Someone just said a good point."
"18954510","18956370"," 25 because he said he would."
"18956470","18959170"," I like that shocks to the market if we pause, right?"
"18959770","18963130"," Someone said 25 VPS because employment is strong. "
"18963410","18964430"," I like that one too."
"18965530","18968470"," There is a question I have for you out there."
"18969510","18972730"," They will babysit at commercial real estate and banking exposure. "
"18973370","18974030"," It's a good one."
"18974450","18977610"," I'm looking for something to see if any of you guys are thinking about this."
"18979390","18986450"," Tell me right now what does Yellen have to do now that the debt ceiling has been solved. "
"18986510","18989490"," Somebody in the chat, please tell me you know what Yellen has to do."
"18992790","18993970"," Somebody in the chat."
"18994970","18995570"," That's right. "
"18996290","18996950"," What is she doing?"
"18997190","18997910"," What is Yellen doing?"
"18999810","19000310"," No."
"19000750","19002750"," Yes and no and refilling the TGA."
"19003570","19004150"," You soap. "
"19007610","19008310"," That's right there."
"19008450","19012210"," Somebody got it cosmonaut knows it replenish funds via bond sales."
"19014490","19020170"," So I want you guys to think about instead of us doing crazy swings with QE and QT. "
"19020750","19025970"," Think about like a supportive fed to make the markets function."
"19026730","19031430"," And then I want you to think about maybe so if you're thinking pause."
"19032370","19035170"," It could be because of what Yellen has to do. "
"19036190","19038610"," That could be the reason if they do pause."
"19039490","19042410"," That would be the reason that nobody talks about."
"19042710","19045290"," When we're all like out there guessing like was it because of the war?"
"19045470","19048250"," Is it because of commercial real estate?"
"19048490","19048910"," What is the reason?"
"19049410","19055130"," It's possible that they could pause due to what Yellen has to do. "
"19055170","19056930"," It could be too disruptive to the market."
"19057590","19062970"," When you hear bears out there saying once the debt ceiling bill is solved or solved."
"19062970","19065010"," The market's going to crash right?"
"19065790","19072090"," The pause could help thwart or blunt that. "
"19072810","19073490"," That's right."
"19073610","19075470"," She has to sell bonds daily."
"19075690","19075870"," Absolutely. "
"19076950","19082550"," And the argument is that if she dumps all these bonds into the market, it's going to be bad."
"19082970","19085610"," It removes money from the cash market."
"19088760","19090460"," She is the jerk off J-Pow. "
"19095270","19095950"," That's right."
"19096170","19102810"," So that coupled with a raise could spell some pretty rough times for the stock market."
"19103370","19108230"," So pay attention to that as we head into that rate increase meeting. "
"19108810","19113330"," The other question that it would bring up would be is she actually going to sell."
"19114190","19117070"," As many T bills as she says, right?"
"19117070","19120550"," And then you've got so they do the 25 BPS."
"19121190","19123830"," They're going to have to be have a softer touch on the market. "
"19132230","19134550"," Who are the Fort like buyers of last resort?"
"19134890","19135370"," It's them."
"19137090","19141770"," So what they if you read the if you read all the details, they claim."
"19142570","19143810"," They claim that they're dumped. "
"19144070","19145330"," They're like we have no buyers."
"19145490","19146470"," We don't sell them, right?"
"19146630","19147270"," But that's bullshit."
"19147430","19147910"," They sell them. "
"19148030","19149050"," They warehouse that shit."
"19149910","19152550"," If you read closely in the details, they warehouse it."
"19152550","19153750"," They take it off the books. "
"19155250","19155810"," Absolutely."
"19161600","19162800"," I kid you not."
"19163660","19164580"," What's his name?"
"19165180","19168860"," Jedi Marcus dropped some of the Fed details on this program. "
"19169980","19173220"," And basically they as much as the market can absorb."
"19173480","19174480"," Whatever can't be absorbed."
"19175280","19176420"," They're telling you publicly. "
"19177520","19178960"," And they admit to this."
"19179200","19180460"," The Fed it's not like a conspiracy."
"19183740","19187380"," Like the Treasury is full bore QE still. "
"19188500","19190680"," Like it's the quietly behind the scenes."
"19190860","19191800"," It's still QE."
"19194800","19197560"," No, I think the pause could cause panic. "
"19198500","19202660"," He would have to come out and say something like, Hey, we have to do this work with the Treasury"
"19202660","19202960"," Department."
"19203960","19204760"," This should."
"19205880","19206440"," Pausing. "
"19207520","19210360"," Would not do too much damage to the market."
"19211520","19213580"," That could be something that he says."
"19213760","19218120"," I'm trying to give you the idea behind if they pause what would be the reason. "
"19220120","19221740"," It could possibly be that."
"19221980","19224180"," Now, I think they're doing 25 VPS."
"19225040","19230280"," But if I wouldn't, so I'm going to give like my most, my biggest percentage to 25 VPS. "
"19230280","19236720"," And then maybe a talking about saying this is our terminal rate."
"19237300","19238880"," Or we're going to pause at this."
"19239100","19241920"," So my, if I had a high percentage thought. "
"19243340","19244780"," Or a conviction."
"19245320","19248300"," It's 25 VPS with a pause."
"19249740","19251680"," So here's your last 25. "
"19252600","19253560"," We are pausing."
"19254740","19256520"," And we'll look at it in the fall."
"19258100","19259100"," That's what I think you're getting. "
"19260280","19262660"," Give that like a 60% chance."
"19263500","19264780"," Maybe yes, 60."
"19265540","19266660"," And then I'm going to give you. "
"19268980","19272740"," 20 to 30% chance of not even that much."
"19272880","19274340"," I'll give you a 20% chance of."
"19276300","19277200"," A pause. "
"19278520","19280860"," If you get the pause, something's wrong."
"19283380","19289360"," And I'm going to give you like a 10% or 10%, 5% chance of 50 basis points."
"19289360","19292300"," And a 5% chance of a cut. "
"19299280","19301020"," Oh, you want the bullpump musical now?"
