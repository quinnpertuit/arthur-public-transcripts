"89990","94350"," We got to change that to the stock market show."
"94630","95270"," I got work to do."
"112320","113120"," Good morning. "
"114620","115980"," I'm going to get right into it."
"116740","118500"," We're not going to take too long here."
"125720","126960"," What's everybody doing this morning?"
"130400","135300"," I figured I come on early this morning here. "
"138390","139090"," Give me a second."
"147710","150330"," In terms of this time now, 9.15 a.m. Eastern time."
"150610","152710"," Do you get the US Industrial Production Month over month?"
"153430","160310"," Forecast is 0% from the prior minus 0.1%. Range is 0.3 to minus 0.5%. That data"
"160310","160990"," is for November. "
"161930","167590"," The US capacity utilization forecast is 79 spot 8% from the prior 79 spot 9%."
"167590","173570"," The US Industrial Production Year over year forecast of minus 0.2% from the prior 3.2% to"
"173570","174330"," 8%."
"174330","180750"," The US Manufacturing Output Month over month saw a prior rate of 0.1%. How's everybody doing this"
"180750","180950"," morning?"
"181470","184530"," Just to make you aware, ECB's regard is currently answering questions now. "
"185350","186390"," Good morning, Hiroshi."
"186430","186730"," Good morning."
"186950","187690"," Pay is on. "
"187830","195800"," I got to do a real quick post here for 0.0% from the prior."
"196980","201000"," I've got some stuff I got to do here in the background."
"201720","203140"," We're going to start early this morning. "
"203480","205780"," We're going to take a look at Tesla specifically."
"207100","216860"," We have a lot to do in terms of OPEC's and"
"224410","225790"," it's a lot to do."
"225790","227450"," Spy and rebalancing. "
"228590","235630"," It's falling to 141 spot 13 basis points lowest level since around December of 2020."
"235630","245530"," And we're"
"248320","253760"," probably coming into some form of a trend change today."
"254100","261260"," So as we come into this trend change, we're going to start to look at any pace that have to"
"261260","262320"," be read together. "
"264500","265940"," See if I got this right here."
"271440","273460"," We're going to look at Tesla this one."
"273560","274960"," Oh, what did I do wrong there?"
"277740","281840"," It's obvious that it's obvious that we should expect 50 basis point hikes for a period of time. "
"281840","285860"," That's easy because the guard saying it's obvious that we should expect 50 basis point hikes for a"
"285860","286540"," period of time."
"289060","291200"," I'm going to mute this here."
"292760","294840"," Okay, ECB is coming out right now. "
"295360","297460"," We're going to take a look at Tesla this morning."
"302440","304660"," And before we get started, a couple of things are going to do this morning."
"304880","305400"," So it's nine away. "
"305480","306100"," We've got 20 minutes."
"307040","308400"," We're going to take a quick look at Tesla."
"308740","311100"," Let's first of all, let's say good morning to all you guys here. "
"311680","313640"," Morning Jay Cortini, good morning, AKA Tegan."
"314680","315480"," Who else is here?"
"317920","320560"," Sue Spyplex, Liam, Gary, Sam."
"320800","321460"," Good to see you. "
"321460","322680"," Our Lee B."
"322800","322860"," D."
"323180","323180"," Troy."
"323180","323960"," Good to see you."
"325560","326400"," Ryan Dean. "
"326720","327160"," Exu."
"327360","327720"," Rohit."
"327960","328660"," Euro Boomer. "
"329080","329840"," Eric Granstrom."
"330720","331680"," Richard James."
"332100","332560"," Gary Patrick. "
"332880","333880"," Good to see all of you guys this morning."
"334760","335280"," Yes."
"335300","339060"," We've got some some weakness today, which is nice to see. "
"339740","344100"," I started clearing charts in here because we're going to be looking for a trend change."
"345180","348100"," So just looking at a fit on a five hour 50."
"348280","349360"," Let's look at a 15 minute chart. "
"350380","354260"," And I just want you to see all the moving averages are beginning to roll over down below here."
"355580","357240"," We're going to go over to Tesla there just a moment."
"357340","361740"," But if you are out there, hopefully you read the posts that I made for you this morning. "
"362340","365800"," This is kind of like the bull's last chance for a holiday rally down here."
"365880","367860"," And there's there's some options positioning."
"368440","372840"," I wasn't able to I'm going to try to take a break at some point this morning and show you"
"372840","375420"," the options data from the CBOE. "
"375740","377140"," I did download it last night."
"377280","377900"," It was kind of wonky."
"378040","381160"," And then this morning I want to wait until the market opens to download it. "
"381160","382920"," So you can see the repositioning in the market."
"383400","388440"," That's taking place for a trend reversal."
"388800","389700"," And I want you to see this. "
"389960","398080"," So if you are a bull here or a bear, you are looking for this breakdown below here."
"398080","399820"," I think it's 390-17."
"402720","406640"," And this is the only support kind of holding up the market here, right?"
"406920","411340"," When you're looking for an hourly, usually you're looking for an hourly trend reversal. "
"412320","413940"," And this is kind of where we're at right now."
"414040","418920"," You can kind of see moving averages starting to roll over trying to push down the market below here"
"418920","423140"," and start a new hourly trend for much lower lows."
"423480","426140"," So what we'll do is we're going to plan for that. "
"427140","435080"," The bears want to, at least that's where the options market's really not showing us getting below"
"435080","440440"," into this 32 to 382, 385, but you'd really want to see this in a Friday."
"441540","447780"," Some kind of a close down here for bears to see that trend reversal for much lower lows."
"448280","452020"," If we break down here, we should get some nice fat trend change. "
"452760","458640"," I would say to the bears only one last thing where the option market is positioned, there is a fair"
"458640","462580"," chance that the bulls will try to buy down here somewhere."
"463240","465320"," So just be conscious of that."
"465400","470160"," If you're going to take any profit off the table down here and restart a new short down below this"
"470160","473960"," zone here, this 390 would be the next short in the market. "
"474600","478680"," So 390, you're looking for a break for a trend reversal as a bear."
"478680","482120"," As a bull, this is your last chance for an alpha alley."
"482280","483280"," I'll be honest with you, 390. "
"483880","486500"," You don't get any other chances."
"486980","491160"," As a matter of fact, you broke the pivot this morning."
"491520","493880"," I'll post all this stuff up here for you as we move on. "
"494520","496480"," But this is kind of a key zone down here."
"497080","498700"," Last chance for your alpha alley."
"499320","502400"," The moment you start breaking 390 down here, there's no hope for you. "
"502500","505100"," You're going to see the bears try to get underneath."
"506880","510240"," 393, start rejecting and start moving us down."
"510980","517960"," This is the time when you can become more confident as a bear below these levels for some much,"
"517960","520380"," much, much larger lows, big trend change. "
"521020","522700"," The meat of that trade is down here."
"523260","526320"," We talk about where the meat of the trade is on bottoms and on tops."
"527040","529140"," And the bears are totally looking for this 100%. "
"530120","531800"," We've been up here for how long now?"
"532080","532860"," I mean, you guys know, right?"
"532860","536140"," This has been going on since mid or early October, right?"
"536580","542560"," And we've just spent the entire month, almost three quarters of the month of November here."
"543400","550380"," And, of course, we're coming into the OPEX of right at the end of the year."
"551200","551620"," Quad-witching. "
"551940","553140"," We've got the 31st."
"553480","557440"," All this time for the bears to just get back down under here and start hitting some lows."
"558000","559780"," Look at the JPM call at some point today. "
"559780","563520"," How deep can we get on that JPM call?"
"563680","564780"," There's a couple other callers."
"564960","565980"," I think January and February."
"566500","570240"," We can talk about those as well as we get through the program. "
"570420","571060"," So we're making it."
"571280","573220"," We're looking to make this turn here."
"573500","575900"," Bears have been waiting for this for two months. "
"576200","581460"," It's a long time, not two months, but close enough month and a half for bears to be like, please,"
"582020","582620"," trend reverse."
"582700","583560"," And we haven't done it, right?"
"584120","589680"," This is where the market stays irrational longer than you anticipated."
"589680","592420"," You're buying like crash puts over here. "
"592980","595220"," And, you know, we've been sitting here for a month and a half."
"595860","597220"," We're looking for some kind of reversal."
"599440","601640"," So we're going to switch over to Tesla real quick. "
"601820","603680"," Okay, we're just going to look at a few things on Tesla."
"604420","606320"," And I want to help the Tesla gang out."
"606660","607440"," Tesla bears out too. "
"607820","609180"," Bull's bears doesn't really matter."
"609320","611220"," We're just going to take a quick, fast look."
"612300","616640"," And then what we'll do is we'll start charting for a trend reversal. "
"617400","618620"," How deep does it go?"
"618820","619580"," How bad does it get?"
"620280","626760"," It's going to be crucial for you as we look at where Tesla is, where Tesla is going, where the"
"626760","630140"," market's going in the positioning."
"630600","632420"," Just right away, first off, okay?"
"633060","637760"," We have broken below the weekly moving average on Tesla."
"638600","647140"," These are key places where a stock or an index wants to keep or have a reaction bounce off of"
"647140","648900"," this moving average. "
"648900","650860"," These are on much larger timeframes."
"652280","659980"," We've only seen Tesla break below a weekly moving average on very, very, very rare occasions."
"661420","662800"," Very rare occasions. "
"663520","664760"," It's not a frequent occurrence."
"665320","670680"," And it starts to bring up questions about how deep does that go, right?"
"671540","673900"," How often have we seen those moments in Tesla?"
"673900","676520"," They're very few and very far between."
"677140","685720"," And you can see back here in 2019, there was one of these moments where Tesla blew right through it"
"685720","687660"," and it was really ugly, right?"
"687820","693320"," This is going on from April into May or June, excuse me, June 19th. "
"693820","698020"," So some major declines when they've broken down below."
"698300","702040"," There's some other examples here where they've touched around and rocket shipped off."
"702040","708500"," Same here back in 2016, February of 2016, and then again in November, 2016. "
"708980","712960"," It's kind of the scenario if we trade the market sideways, you'll be looking for in Tesla."
"713820","717080"," But this one over here is a crash moment in Tesla."
"717740","721400"," Very brutal in its history back in 2019, if I remember that. "
"721880","728360"," I want to say that this was sometime, I want to say that this right around here was when Elon,"
"728360","732920"," I think, did the lemon tweet or something and it was over like a long weekend."
"733880","738380"," I think I remember I was in Wall Street Beths one morning at like 4 a.m. and Elon came"
"738380","743900"," into the sub, I believe, and tweeted something and then we had a major reversal."
"745260","748300"," So this is kind of a key moment here in the life of Tesla. "
"749040","755380"," We're back to that moment again right now where there could be some real damage done to Tesla."
"755380","758540"," How deep can that damage go in Tesla?"
"759460","760640"," It's kind of the question, right?"
"761640","767380"," We're down here breaking through right now some known support, right?"
"769900","771580"," Start to plug in some of this here."
"772520","774720"," Some known consolidation, this wasn't distribution. "
"775660","783720"," We have another level below with less distribution and this is what people are wondering about is"
"783720","784580"," how bad does it get."
"785500","789540"," I was talking to someone last night about how many times have they split?"
"790380","793220"," How much damage is actually being done?"
"794500","796120"," You get gaps below here."
"796800","800280"," This can get really, really nasty, really fast here for Tesla. "
"800660","804100"," I think that's the question that people are asking, a nice huge thrust up here."
"804520","809540"," Another thrust down here, consolidations, a very small consolidation phase down here."
"809540","816820"," If you start to break through this level right here at $61, I think yesterday I always was saying,"
"817440","824920"," do people really know where the banks are in on a stock or major holders on Tesla or in?"
"825820","826880"," It is much lower. "
"827680","832960"," If you start to break through those levels and you want to see what real support is, $24 is not"
"832960","834320"," out of the realm of possibility."
"835100","839780"," I think it's $46 is another one, $29."
"840480","842180"," Does that mean we get this low?"
"842600","849180"," No, but if you go into a crash type scenario, you start looking at these numbers down below and"
"849180","851100"," wondering how bad can it actually get. "
"851480","852960"," That's the one that I was going to have, $46."
"854740","857680"," My targets in here were somewhere around $96."
"858500","863600"," I was expecting some kind of a reaction bounce here around $136. "
"865000","867180"," I'll show you where I was looking for a reaction here."
"868980","873980"," Let me see if I can make a see if I can think it's over here."
"876380","882400"," Let me see where I always forget where it is, but just a second. "
"882500","883540"," I don't know why I'm not finding this."
"883660","884600"," I'm just waking up now."
"888300","895700"," Somewhere in here at this $136 zone is you're kind of looking for some kind of a buy down in"
"895700","895900"," here. "
"896820","903800"," Let me make this, or at least a reaction type move or buy down here."
"903960","905600"," $136 is kind of it right here."
"906100","908640"," You can kind of see this gap down below here. "
"909220","910280"," It's $140, $136."
"911040","916300"," Sometimes when you see a stock, this is like a classic."
"916600","921300"," If you're looking at this chart right, this is a classic look off over here. "
"922800","929760"," You're kind of looking for this impulsive move down, this one big red candle down here, and then a"
"929760","930480"," reaction trade."
"930840","932960"," Do I think the trade is over for Tesla going lower?"
"933220","933680"," I don't."
"934820","936900"," My buy zone is down around this $96. "
"937920","942680"," But after this past week and the stuff that's been going on, I mean, does beg the question of can"
"942680","944820"," you get down to the 45 and the 67?"
"945740","947780"," It's on Tesla at some point."
"948620","953320"," So we're going to do some other stuff here and just quickly take them to dump all this stuff."
"954980","957580"," We're just going to look at Tesla with some indicators, okay?"
"961180","962740"," And we'll start on chat. "
"962740","964920"," Now, let's just forget about it here."
"965100","969400"," You guys all have, you know, you guys all draw like trend lines and stuff like that."
"970640","973000"," Just just on a daily, we are starting to. "
"973320","975000"," We're not quite there if you look down here."
"975940","981680"," When you start to see reversals on Tesla, even if they're not permanent, you start to see down here"
"981680","983360"," these lower bound ranges on Tesla."
"984260","990140"," And even if you start to look back in historically on Tesla, anything down here, 2."
"990140","996880"," 2.15 is kind of the extreme for Tesla, even when things get really ugly. "
"998380","1005200"," You can see down here 2.15. We're not quite at 2.15 right now."
"1005260","1005900"," I want you to see that."
"1006080","1006100"," Okay. "
"1006220","1010420"," This is more room for Tesla to stretch even lower."
"1011240","1011380"," Okay."
"1012220","1013660"," This is just a cyclical chart. "
"1014420","1019540"," You're going to look at a weekly chart for cycles for Tesla that already made its bounce."
"1020760","1023859"," Way up here this first, this first like these two blood baths."
"1024060","1025780"," This one right as move was huge. "
"1025859","1027500"," And this move was huge here."
"1027960","1033020"," And you can see that on a weekly timeframe, it's recovering somewhat."
"1033020","1033460"," Okay. "
"1034240","1039900"," So just looking at those two weekly and daily timeframes, I'm going to expect at some point on the"
"1039900","1040880"," retest down below."
"1041440","1045579"," And I'm looking for a bounce here like 136, 150, 150."
"1045579","1052680"," If you can get that one big red candle down, it would start to make me think that there's at"
"1052680","1054380"," least a bounce coming up at this point. "
"1055960","1058280"," We'll look at the, let me see here."
"1058780","1070120"," I'm going to take this one down the cycle, cycle indicator, and then we're going to look at price"
"1070120","1071720"," percent and a momentum."
"1072580","1076080"," I want you to see here how rare this is for Tesla to be getting down here. "
"1076080","1080920"," The depth of, and bring some of this up here."
"1082420","1085080"," How bad a sell off in Tesla can get, right?"
"1085520","1087620"," And we already have a previous low down here."
"1087740","1091400"," You can see this minus 1366 in the bottom right inside of your screen. "
"1091860","1092920"," We're not there yet, right?"
"1093200","1097780"," There's still a point of selling here that we haven't seen down below."
"1098520","1100860"," And this is just looking for a bottom."
"1101000","1102080"," Where is bottom on Tesla?"
"1102560","1102900"," Is it 136?"
"1104600","1105260"," Historically, it's not. "
"1105260","1107360"," Historically, you can see lower lows."
"1108280","1110440"," To sort of say, man, we can probably see a bounce at 136."
"1111320","1115420"," Can we see lower like $96 or even $46 or $48?"
"1116120","1119700"," We know historically that it can go lower. "
"1120160","1121420"," So just be aware of that."
"1121840","1124080"," There is some bottoming going on in the PMO."
"1124360","1125480"," This is the momentum indicator. "
"1125780","1129860"," It's still not showing though that we can go lower on momentum as well."
"1129860","1135880"," So you're talking about that momentum being the market sentiment."
"1136300","1137480"," The all hope is lost. "
"1137800","1139360"," You see people on the internet right now."
"1139800","1142740"," Very scared for where Tesla is going."
"1143820","1146460"," We'll look on a weekly chart for these as well. "
"1148100","1153220"," And this is one of the better ones showing some of the PPO."
"1153480","1154900"," We are at an extreme level here."
"1155380","1161060"," We are also at an extreme level on the PMO on a weekly level. "
"1161260","1161880"," So we're getting close."
"1162700","1168860"," If you're a Tesla bull, right, you should be positioned for a few things."
"1169160","1174500"," You should be positioned or you're trying to be looking for a place to buy some. "
"1174680","1176420"," Any you guys have trade options on Tesla?"
"1176660","1176760"," No."
"1177500","1183580"," An option can go in Tesla from 25 cents or a dollar to $30, $20, $30 in a day."
"1184420","1190440"," Now, for buying a bottom on Tesla, we can assume at this point that we're not at bottom. "
"1191100","1196840"," That you can probably though find places to dollar cost average on Tesla."
"1197280","1203400"," So if you were a Tesla bull, some of you guys don't know me on YouTube, or not YouTube, but"
"1203400","1207080"," Twitter or know me back from Wall Street betdays and stuff like that."
"1207880","1214520"," Know that whenever we're up here on these peaks, that I've always been known to say sell the"
"1214520","1214740"," market. "
"1214740","1215700"," Sometimes it's right here."
"1216400","1221740"," It's like, you know, usually somewhere in this, you know, in these tops, I'm usually somewhere here"
"1221740","1228200"," saying, you know, take profit or stop buying or, you know, that kind of stuff shows you buying"
"1228200","1234520"," Tesla on Lowe's on rips up stuff like this, right, dollar cost averaging from Lowe's."
"1235180","1237760"," And then the same thing would be as we head down below here. "
"1238480","1242960"," This is where you want to, I know that it's easy for, or it's, I know it's easy."
"1243060","1246240"," The bull is a Tesla bull when run highs up here."
"1246980","1254100"," But if you're a long time Tesla holder, long time Tesla bull, you feel so much better when you're"
"1254100","1258960"," buying on the Lowe's down here and you can decide what you're doing with your position, whether"
"1258960","1263280"," you're selling calls or puts on it, whether you're taking profit, whether you're, you know, paying"
"1263280","1265040"," for your kids to go to college or something. "
"1266200","1271100"," Whether you're just trying to support the company, you know, it still always feels better to be"
"1271100","1273400"," buying Lowe's on Tesla."
"1274080","1278020"," Okay, so I know that the negativity is out there crazy right now."
"1278660","1285860"," But if you want that opportunity to get a good price on Tesla, no matter how low it goes, right,"
"1286080","1288940"," no matter if the market crashes or whatever, you want to feel good about it. "
"1289040","1290340"," It's not about buying up here."
"1290340","1297460"," I can assure you that buyers up here, right, never feel good, but they never do."
"1297860","1301280"," And you want to feel good about the positioning you take in the stock market. "
"1301720","1310000"," So you're going to hear the stock market drum beats get, you know, louder and louder and louder on"
"1310000","1310600"," market crash."
"1310620","1312140"," You're going to hear the drum beats."
"1312320","1317500"," It's probably going to last until it happens in 2023 or 2024, whenever it happens. "
"1319060","1324380"," So you want to, you want, I'm not saying that you, that you buy here permanently, saying that you"
"1324380","1326080"," need to, I guess, other than options."
"1326680","1331760"," If you're looking for a bottom to buy in Tesla, you should start thinking about, hey, I've got, if"
"1331760","1336380"," you have a thousand dollars, you know, you can scale up to a million dollars."
"1336680","1341280"," This is the time to start looking at places that you'll say, I'm going to buy five percent, ten"
"1341280","1347360"," percent, fifteen percent, thirty percent, and then I'm going to have some ammunition for this turn"
"1347360","1349940"," here so that I don't miss whenever that turn happens. "
"1350820","1353700"," To make sense, this is, this is where you, you really want to start to."
"1354100","1358460"," This is where, this is where a Warren Buffett starts to come in and say, you know, I'm going to"
"1358460","1360140"," start buying this stock that I love."
"1360540","1364080"," I like Clorox bleach, I love oil, whatever it is that you like. "
"1365060","1368840"," So if you're a Tesla bro, this is, when you're seeing the negativity in the market, this is the"
"1368840","1370760"," time for you to start planning on."
"1370760","1372400"," This is where I'm going to execute."
"1373240","1377740"," These are my levels that I'm going to buy at, and I'm going to be a holder for as long"
"1377740","1378700"," as it takes for it to come back. "
"1379140","1382080"," Okay, now any of those people out there that are saying it's never coming back, it's going"
"1382080","1384760"," bankrupt, that's a risk on any stock out there."
"1385040","1386700"," It's a risk on any company out there."
"1387240","1390460"," It's not really for me or for anyone else out there to tell you what you like. "
"1390920","1392240"," But I know that some of you like Tesla."
"1392600","1397780"," I know that there's, you know, there's a group of Tesla bulls that have been around for a long time"
"1397780","1404100"," and have been through the ups and downs of pure hate for Elon Musk, pure hate for the company."
"1405720","1409780"," In some that are like, I'm dumping it now or I've never come back to this. "
"1410280","1414800"," But as we get down here and start to plunge below these levels, a break of this line maybe and"
"1414800","1421120"," come back down here, start, if you're a bull and you're going to hang out through it, start getting"
"1421120","1424280"," ready for a place to dollar cost average."
"1424660","1429220"," Whenever we're up here at dollar cost, I always hear the dollar cost averaging talk when we're up"
"1429220","1429400"," here."
"1430160","1434600"," I always hear bullshit about dollar cost averaging bullshit whenever we're up here, whenever we're"
"1434600","1434960"," up here. "
"1435300","1438160"," And I never hear it when we're down here."
"1438680","1439940"," I never hear it there."
"1440060","1440720"," I never hear it there. "
"1440880","1441500"," I never hear it there."
"1441720","1442360"," I never hear it there."
"1442880","1443740"," I never hear it down there. "
"1443920","1445120"," It's always, it's always on tops."
"1445980","1448960"," It's always something like I'll buy it for the rest of my life and people out there."
"1449140","1450780"," And I don't think that they're telling the truth. "
"1451340","1452040"," I'll be honest with you."
"1452720","1460560"," From my experience, they're actually looking for these lower lows to enter into Tesla."
"1461060","1466060"," So as a bull, if you're a young bull, young Tesla bull or whatever you are, and you've bought these"
"1466060","1471680"," tops up here, have patience and start to think about where you want to buy Tesla. "
"1472820","1476720"," So I remember these key levels that I'm showing you here this morning."
"1477380","1485200"," Now what we'll do is we'll chart out Tesla for the day for you so that we'll leave this here"
"1485200","1485600"," for a minute."
"1486340","1491400"," We're going to take a look at Tesla and this is where the second part of this conversation is. "
"1491800","1501520"," I want you to also realize that you've got a yearly OPEC coming up here."
"1501800","1507000"," I want you to see this is going back to November 11th of 2021."
"1507000","1511520"," And you've got these companies, these banks, I should say, institutions. "
"1512040","1516800"," You've got Kathy Woods, you've got Elon Musk, you've got, believe it or not, Elon Musk, right?"
"1518160","1521140"," You've got long-term test holders, banks, institutions."
"1522260","1526200"," I know that there are some banks over here that are trying to pressure Elon right now, but you have"
"1526200","1532880"," to understand that there's an action of selling out of profit and long-term positions that took a"
"1532880","1535220"," year to do one full year."
"1535960","1537120"," It could take longer. "
"1537360","1539220"," It could take into 2024 as well."
"1539560","1545640"," But the point that I'm trying to make to you here is we're getting into this year-end OPECs on"
"1545640","1545900"," Tesla."
"1547880","1556400"," There are funds out there that will be looking to rebalance on this Friday. "
"1558740","1562500"," They'll be looking to rebalance on the 31st."
"1562500","1563840"," I think it was three dates I gave."
"1564300","1565220"," I don't remember exactly. "
"1565480","1566460"," Oh, and the 24th."
"1566820","1569800"," So remember these dates as we as Tesla trades down."
"1570220","1575440"," It'll be this Friday, Christmas Eve, and the 31st. "
"1576180","1580680"," And so what I'm looking for heading into is having to clean up this entire chart here."
"1581260","1583420"," I can delete this, everything on this chart here."
"1586660","1590020"," So what I'm looking for, and I say I'm looking for a trade on Tesla, right?"
"1590020","1599880"," I'm looking for shorts and retail and bears to hear the cacophony of the news saying that the worst"
"1599880","1602180"," is yet to come and all this other nonsense that they say. "
"1602580","1604080"," And I'm looking to take a trade on Tesla."
"1605300","1613200"," I'm looking for some way to find a hole that some shorts are chasing down here and actually find"
"1613200","1614120"," that bottom by."
"1614740","1618280"," And there's only three places that I'm looking this year for the rest of this year. "
"1618280","1622520"," I'm looking for again, this Friday for this rebalancing."
"1622800","1625040"," And I'm also looking for the 24th and 31st."
"1625620","1629680"," And sometimes what you'll find is the during rebalancing. "
"1629800","1633580"," The last hour or so of the day, three o'clock in the afternoon."
"1633860","1635220"," And I've seen this happen on Tesla before."
"1636260","1639700"," You'll see the last hour of the afternoon, a ramp in Tesla. "
"1640540","1641500"," You can see Tesla go up."
"1642260","1648260"," I don't know."
"1648260","1653340"," If you're a longtime Tesla trader to Tesla owner, you've seen these moments happen. "
"1653940","1656320"," You see this volume capitulation down here."
"1656360","1658620"," I start to see stuff like this I'm looking for."
"1658980","1663700"," I'm just going to probably open up my charts on Tesla on those dates. "
"1664380","1668800"," Like this Friday, tomorrow I'm going to have Tesla in the background just be staring at it because"
"1668800","1671240"," there can be a moment where in a rebalancing on us."
"1671720","1673200"," And not all takers do this."
"1673200","1679720"," I was asked someone on Twitter yesterday, I said, somebody have access to the stocks have come down"
"1679720","1680500"," the most this year. "
"1680820","1683900"," And it was like a rap sheet of the worst companies, right?"
"1684200","1685380"," Like all these horrible companies."
"1685960","1688080"," And some of them are good companies, but some of them are horrible."
"1688860","1692120"," They were pumped up during the speculative growth phase of the last bull run. "
"1693100","1695920"," And you could see that those companies are never coming back."
"1696080","1701180"," But then you find a company like Tesla here and there is going to be some long hedge funds that"
"1701180","1704460"," are going to want to step in in this rebalancing and buy."
"1704760","1710640"," If you can sneak in in that arbitrage moment and ride on the coattails of these funds that are"
"1710640","1715740"," going to buy down here in the next coming week or so, two weeks, even if the market's rolling over,"
"1716280","1722920"," there should be a moment where they come in and you can sometimes jump in and you'll ride a wave"
"1722920","1724140"," up and make some fat cash. "
"1724380","1726640"," You make that fat cash put on your pocket, right?"
"1726640","1731000"," And you wait for the market to show itself that it's going to turn over."
"1731800","1737680"," We talked yesterday about the unemployment rate having to go up to find bottom in the quote unquote"
"1737680","1738040"," market."
"1738640","1745140"," So you can use these opportunities in the coming year here with Tesla for when they rebalance Tesla"
"1745140","1747180"," to possibly generate some cash flow. "
"1747520","1749640"," If you're ready to actually buy a bottom in Tesla."
"1751300","1752600"," You're not going to hear this."
"1752760","1753740"," You're not going to hear this on Twitter. "
"1753900","1754800"," You're not going to hear this on the news."
"1754800","1757920"," You're going to hear a cacophony of sell, sell, sell on Tesla."
"1758260","1767520"," It's an important part of getting Tesla bulls, long-term big holders to begin to sell out of the"
"1767520","1772180"," last part, the last part of their positioning so that banks can get the best price. "
"1772520","1773240"," That is how this works."
"1774020","1775020"," That's how workoff works."
"1775800","1779000"," Especially coming back at some point. "
"1780340","1784360"," I want you to realize that there are going to these moments and these coming weeks, two weeks,"
"1784360","1786540"," they're very critical moments for Tesla."
"1788540","1790480"," We'll put some levels down for you this morning."
"1791260","1792880"," I apologize not reading anything. "
"1793100","1793920"," Look at it right off the bell."
"1797040","1799460"," Right off the bell, it's already happened."
"1799760","1801080"," There is some of this down here already. "
"1801880","1804220"," Just right off the bell, 152, it's already at 156."
"1806280","1806680"," Chocker."
"1807500","1809900"," I'm not shocked that this is already happening off the bell this morning. "
"1810020","1810800"," I'll be honest with you."
"1811640","1813660"," There should be these moments this week."
"1814340","1819560"," I'm telling you, as you see the rebalancing in this week, I'm not shocked at all at this moment"
"1819560","1821220"," that Tesla is ripping off the bell. "
"1824760","1825820"," Surprise, surprise."
"1828340","1835600"," I was looking at stochastic, Fibonacci levels, moving averages, high lows, RSI and HLC and Tesla."
"1835820","1839900"," I'm like lower ranges like 147.89. We're super close. "
"1840840","1848980"," We are super close on every bottom on an inter-day Tesla model to buy a dip down here."
"1849720","1851940"," Chocker that it's ripping right here."
"1852220","1853920"," These are reactions you're going to expect on Tesla. "
"1854740","1855300"," We're down here."
"1855640","1857760"," It reactions after a yearly OPEX."
"1858580","1863980"," We're going to draw in some pivot points and support and resistance lines for you this morning. "
"1864860","1869380"," We've got 157.91. I'm going to put this one up here for you."
"1870400","1872020"," I post these levels every morning for you."
"1874640","1875620"," We're right here. "
"1876660","1878100"," There's a pin strike actually on it."
"1878200","1878500"," You see that?"
"1878720","1878920"," Right off."
"1879700","1883080"," An absolute exact pin strike on..."
"1883080","1885760"," I love how this happens on Tesla. "
"1888260","1888620"," Classic."
"1888800","1889480"," Right off the bell."
"1890100","1890600"," This is your..."
"1890600","1896510"," So anyway, just so you know, this is your pivot for Tesla. "
"1899440","1902740"," Right here, it's 157.91. I said 156."
"1903700","1908300"," It's 157.91. So I was off."
"1908820","1909700"," Instead I was raped by the 11. "
"1910480","1912760"," 157.91. Let's see here."
"1916600","1918580"," That's close enough within two pennies."
"1920360","1921560"," That's your pivot point in Tesla. "
"1922120","1923240"," This is on an intraday chart."
"1923820","1927780"," If you want to get bullish on Tesla forever, you're looking for a pivot here."
"1928480","1933680"," You're looking for your bullish above and your bearish below this level. "
"1934020","1935480"," So it makes sense for at least on an intraday."
"1937960","1942860"," So when you come on the stream or you're at home or something or in your office, this is going"
"1942860","1946380"," to kind of give you your teeing off point."
"1946580","1946660"," Right?"
"1947340","1948460"," Do we trade below it?"
"1948560","1949280"," Do we trade above it?"
"1949680","1951540"," You bullish or bearish on the day on Tesla. "
"1952680","1954320"," I'm going to give you your first support here."
"1958210","1964310"," 154.20. We'll go over some other stuff here."
"1964450","1965170"," We'll go over some..."
"1970430","1973330"," We'll go over some febber tracements and stuff like that. "
"1976450","1981970"," When you start to break below 154.20. I don't even know what to say."
"1982390","1988170"," You can do this on your favorite ticker whenever you like."
"1989870","1991810"," So here's your first support down below here. "
"1993130","2014550"," And then you've got 151.60. 147."
"2030670","2032950"," Two good morning to all of you out there if you're just joining us."
"2033810","2036610"," Just spent a little bit of time on Tesla for Tesla Gang this morning. "
"2050719","2054040"," I'm going to see right here where we're just coming straight down, looking to break through this,"
"2054500","2056400"," picking a new low."
"2056400","2057860"," Tesla fighting for pivot."
"2065780","2091179"," First resistance, 160.51. And"
"2091179","2133370"," we've got 164.22. I'm"
"2133370","2134830"," going to show you something really cool here in a minute too. "
"2135450","2136950"," I'm going to bring up another chart for you on Tesla."
"2139610","2144370"," You always want to be looking on these stocks for previous lows, previous highs."
"2145870","2146990"," Swing high, swing lows. "
"2147250","2148990"," You want to be looking for these things."
"2149210","2150370"," You've got a previous low here."
"2165380","2167240"," I'm breaking above pivot right now in Tesla. "
"2168280","2171340"," Previous high from the day before, previous low from the day before, right?"
"2174320","2176740"," Got another lower high in here."
"2177040","2178440"," You can always put these in if you want."
"2178940","2180760"," You label them however you like. "
"2188660","2193800"," Now trading higher to 159.61. It's a nice little little area here where the seller's going to want"
"2193800","2194360"," to step in."
"2209410","2213630"," I'm going to show you one other thing on, let me just second here."
"2213670","2214470"," I'm going to show you one other thing. "
"2216170","2217850"," Let's see if I have this zigzag on here."
"2221760","2225200"," If you're looking for trend reversals on Tesla, I think I have it on here."
"2225200","2226500"," I'm going to show you one more thing here. "
"2227160","2232600"," You get yourself a trading beat chart and try to find this for you."
"2234100","2235620"," I think I have zigzag on here."
"2236160","2237720"," This is a zigzag channel pattern. "
"2239060","2240320"," Does it automatically for you?"
"2240400","2240780"," It's easy."
"2242720","2244180"," You're trying to already down."
"2244560","2245860"," This is on a daily chart. "
"2246840","2247740"," It starts to change."
"2248180","2251840"," You're going to hourly zigzag pattern here on Tesla."
"2252840","2256060"," What is trend on Tesla right now?"
"2256800","2257560"," We know it's down. "
"2258060","2263220"," You can look closer on these and look for places."
"2263780","2265820"," It's already trading up to the center bar."
"2266060","2267980"," It's downward trend on an hourly. "
"2269980","2275800"," It would still be a down trend to 167.16. This is a nice place for you to look."
"2276560","2279200"," You can see that these are T off places for Tesla."
"2279800","2283940"," If you're a Tesla bear, Tesla Q, you can see they teed off up here, right?"
"2284620","2285840"," See they teed off up here. "
"2287320","2292440"," You can use this for which way you bearish or bullish on Tesla currently."
"2293340","2295080"," We'll look at it on a 15 minute chart as well."
"2296300","2299800"," You can see the trend is still down on a 15 minute on Tesla. "
"2300180","2301240"," We trade it right back up."
"2301420","2304160"," This is where bears try to come back in and sell it down."
"2304320","2308920"," If we break above on this 15 minute chart, you start to get bullish in the 15 minute chart, right?"
"2310100","2312240"," We'll look back on a five minute chart. "
"2312360","2317700"," If you trade in the five minute chart, you can see we had a nice clean bounce down here."
"2317860","2323980"," If we open this morning and you use the zigzag channel and you are down here, you'd say on the"
"2323980","2326260"," five minute I'm looking to trade this higher here, right?"
"2327060","2327660"," Does that make sense?"
"2327960","2329160"," You can probably get this on your own."
"2331420","2334060"," It's called a zigzag channels by Lux. "
"2335840","2339040"," You can usually use this to trade Tesla up and down."
"2339780","2343740"," You can actually see in here on the 15 minute we came to an extreme low bounce up."
"2344000","2345140"," Just did that just right now. "
"2345560","2350900"," So if you're just day trading Tesla, it's easy for you to grab some calls up here, some puts down"
"2350900","2351460"," here, right?"
"2351980","2353740"," Depending on the time frame you're trying to work in."
"2354260","2354760"," Does that make sense?"
"2357940","2360180"," So that's a zigzag pattern chart for Tesla."
"2360180","2363340"," Maybe Tesla bulls out there that are looking to be like, hey, when do I buy calls?"
"2363560","2364080"," When do I buy puts?"
"2364200","2365160"," When do I close my calls?"
"2366980","2371100"," When do I re-enter calls for the next leg up, next leg down?"
"2371740","2375880"," So if you're a Tesla bull, you're going to be looking for resistance here in the 15 minute, right?"
"2376720","2378580"," And you're not going to be in calls here, are you?"
"2378820","2382260"," You're going to wait for some kind of consolidation, right?"
"2382540","2388280"," To break up to that next channel that I just showed you in that zigzag for a move higher, right?"
"2388760","2391680"," More consolidation and not start to see a roll. "
"2392200","2394560"," So if you break that roll, you know it's over, right?"
"2394820","2395720"," It's very simple stuff."
"2396500","2401180"," You don't need to be, well, I guess you should learn about Elliott Wave and always moving averages"
"2401180","2407020"," and all that other stuff, but these are very simple ways to know when to buy Tesla calls, when to"
"2407020","2410620"," look for bottoms on Tesla, how long you hold those calls for."
"2412620","2414720"," Is that helping you guys out here at all right now?"
"2416240","2416840"," Make sense?"
"2417400","2421640"," If you're looking for the absolute bottom on Tesla, there's two ways for me to tell you how to look"
"2421640","2421940"," for that. "
"2422760","2427400"," That would be that zigzag pattern would show you in a larger timeframe, a year time, or like a"
"2427400","2428160"," daily timeframe."
"2429000","2432620"," The other thing that I would truly tell you would be you're looking for the unemployment rate to"
"2432620","2437180"," come up a ton for the true bottom on the market in general."
"2438600","2441120"," Okay, so this is pretty simple, right?"
"2441120","2444940"," It's a pretty simple way for you to find a way to make money, trade in Tesla. "
"2445460","2451800"," And then when you're looking for a bottom on Tesla, we'll talk about that on, but we'll talk about"
"2451800","2456180"," that in a class, but there's some market conditions you're looking for as well."
"2458220","2461440"," We'll do a class on how to catch a knife."
"2461940","2464880"," It's a whole other thing, how to catch a knife. "
"2466280","2469040"," And then keep in mind about OPEC's rebalancing in the next few days."
"2469040","2472860"," Any stocks that I want you to be aware of this too, any stocks that have been up all year"
"2472860","2477600"," long, anything that's been has gone up for a full year, you're going to look for those stocks"
"2477600","2482980"," actually sell off into end of year, and you're going to look for any stocks that have been selling"
"2482980","2490020"," off all year long to have some kind of a bump in them from rebalancing."
"2491420","2493900"," Let me go through your comments real quick and see what you guys are saying. "
"2496500","2497580"," Does that work for you guys?"
"2502640","2506080"," Seeking 160 to exit a few Tesla for minor profit, reprice of the remainder."
"2507040","2509640"," Straight moonshot, no chance for some crazy spy rally."
"2509840","2510920"," No 430 off the table. "
"2511360","2511640"," You see."
"2513540","2516400"," Tesla's flying to straight all time, I'm sort of air."
"2516740","2517900"," I know you guys are going to be in here. "
"2518360","2520760"," I know some of you Tesla bulls are going to be in here doing that shit."
"2521380","2522160"," I wouldn't be doing that."
"2523980","2529840"," Yeah, I'm not accumulating here, just as a heads up. "
"2530020","2535000"," Anybody's wondering, this is an opportunity for you in this rebalancing to generate some cash flow"
"2535980","2539060"," so that you can find an actual bottom to buy down the road."
"2542720","2547180"," If any of you guys are just tuning in, I want you to go back to the start of this"
"2547180","2553400"," video please and just watch the entire, if you're a Tesla bull and just joined us, go to the"
"2553400","2556800"," beginning of this video, watch the entire thing, okay?"
"2558980","2562720"," You could take just this part of the video, go right to the beginning."
"2563940","2567500"," The only other thing that I would tell you on this is if you're looking for the actual bottom of"
"2567500","2574780"," Tesla as I said before, you're looking for that trend change on a daily or weekly time frame. "
"2575220","2578980"," We're not seeing that, we're not seeing consolidation at the bottom yet."
"2578980","2582340"," The sideways move, it would take Tesla some time to consolidate."
"2583320","2587800"," And then you've got where the general market is and the general market is about to roll over. "
"2588620","2594820"," You're looking for breath in the spine, you're looking for oversold conditions in the spine, you're"
"2594820","2600380"," looking for oversold conditions in NASDAQ, and then you're looking for some economic conditions, i "
"2600380","2607140",".e. job, unemployment rate coming up substantially for you to actually find the bottom in Tesla."
"2608880","2613120"," We went over that in the video yesterday in some previous videos, probably doing some classes that"
"2613120","2618500"," are specific to these notions so that you can go back and just watch them on their own"
"2618500","2618880"," independently."
"2619780","2624560"," For Tesla gang this morning, pause if you just got here, go back and just watch the video from"
"2624560","2629000"," here, and then speed up to live stream for the day or something like that, we'll be back on spy. "
"2629540","2633800"," What we're going to do today, I think today we're going to focus on is we're going to look at"
"2633800","2635480"," everything."
"2635480","2643800"," We're going to look at the VIX and Spy, we're going to look at HYG, TLT, Gold Oil, Apple, Amazon,"
"2644080","2653540"," XLF, we're going to look at the NASDAQ, the Dow Jones, the S&P 500, for trend reversal coming into"
"2653540","2654520"," the new year."
"2655100","2659660"," So you guys have your levels, know where the sellers are, the buyers are, and how low we're going"
"2659660","2659920"," to go. "
"2661520","2663440"," Oh yeah, baby, look at that Tesla."
"2664460","2666000"," How's that, huh, Tesla bulls?"
"2666820","2668320"," You guys okay right now?"
"2672170","2676310"," Just smashing, impassion here, trying to break above and through."
"2677150","2682770"," I always love coming out of the morning and going through something like this and watching it"
"2682770","2685350"," actually unfold right in front of my eyes. "
"2697250","2701700"," Yeah, you should go back."
"2702000","2703700"," You should go, if you're just joining us, right?"
"2704060","2709180"," You need the entire context of the conversation, go back, watch it all, and then you'll be like,"
"2709280","2709920"," oh, I get what he's saying."
"2710920","2714380"," Because you have to take the entire conversation in, listen to the entire conversation. "
"2716380","2717940"," How's that John Haggard, he was that okay?"
"2721890","2725050"," Okay, so that's my talk today for the bulls, the Tesla bulls."
"2725550","2728230"," Good morning to all of you out there that are joining us right now."
"2728810","2734990"," If you are just joining us and you're a Tesla bull, even a Tesla bear, all of this works for"
"2734990","2735990"," both sides of that trade. "
"2736510","2739830"," Everything I just said works for both sides of that trade."
"2740250","2747310"," So, oh yeah, look at that, look at that pump, look at that pump."
"2752560","2755300"," Just smashing, impassion right now, R1 on Tesla. "
"2756100","2758140"," Do we even care about spy right now?"
"2758220","2759520"," Do we just, we just focus on Tesla?"
"2759920","2761160"," Does it really become the Tesla channel?"
"2764060","2765480"," How are you doing John Haggardee?"
"2768940","2773040"," The John Haggardee is like, oh baby, he's here."
"2773940","2774820"," He's doing it."
"2775940","2778080"," Okay, so above the pivot, above R1. "
"2778480","2780680"," So let's say you are, let's say you are a Tesla bull right now."
"2781420","2783480"," So you're like, Cap, we're going all the way up today."
"2785320","2786960"," Joe Donut does this all the time, right?"
"2787240","2793900"," Joe Donut will look for the previous move lower and he'll start doing. "
"2795380","2798320"," Oh my God, look at this move lower is insane, isn't it?"
"2799240","2803700"," How do you do a, how do you do a retracement on this?"
"2803860","2804140"," Is it here?"
"2804420","2807340"," Is it, is it 182 or is it here?"
"2810740","2818440"," So 38% retracement is roughly 162, 34."
"2822340","2824340"," So keep that number in mind, 162, 34."
"2825340","2826200"," 50% is 165. "
"2828300","2831560"," Now when you have retracement, so typically be you'll tag 38 first."
"2832040","2838080"," If it's from here, you'll tag 38 first, which is right here."
"2839020","2843140"," You'll come down tomorrow or something and then you'll come back up and attempt for the 50. "
"2843820","2846900"," I never doubt Tesla to go all the way back up."
"2846920","2849220"," Believe it or not, hit like 68 or even 70."
"2850640","2852180"," So maybe a price target of 168. "
"2852440","2854840"," I'll be honest with you though, there's some calls that came in in Tesla."
"2856180","2862060"," Giant calls came on Tesla yesterday and they were for 190C on Tesla."
"2863180","2864320"," They're short data too. "
"2865180","2866980"," Next expiry I think, 190C."
"2867220","2868380"," Do I think you're getting to 190?"
"2868980","2869480"," Fuck no."
"2870720","2872080"," But do I think we trade there?"
"2872360","2877520"," Yes, because you've got, you've got some bunch of puts down here, right?"
"2877720","2881960"," Big block of puts down here and they don't want to monetize those. "
"2882180","2883020"," I said this yesterday, right?"
"2883120","2884120"," I've been telling you guys this, right?"
"2885420","2889120"," And now a bunch of calls came in above here at 190."
"2891520","2893660"," So what do the market makers want to do?"
"2893660","2897480"," They want to, they don't want to pay this by going through, right?"
"2898540","2903720"," So they're going to get close to it and then they're going to want to magnet head and higher and"
"2903720","2906360"," then somewhere in the middle right around here, okay?"
"2906920","2913880"," So they won't print these 190s unless more call buyers come in higher than 190 or buy the 190s,"
"2913880","2914880"," right?"
"2915060","2918140"," For you to get to 190, but they will at least come up here somewhere."
"2918360","2922160"," There's R3 area, 166.82. Make sense?"
"2923560","2926400"," And you're going to look for this in specific days coming into the end of the air. "
"2927560","2928180"," Rips higher."
"2931700","2932060"," Tessa."
"2936500","2937140"," That's awesome. "
"2937440","2937720"," So stoked."
"2939100","2939840"," It's good to see."
"2940480","2942400"," Okay, so let's take a look at Spyro quick. "
"2944660","2945880"," That's all my tests for today."
"2946020","2947040"," You guys, you got my attention."
"2947400","2951380"," If you test the bulls are in here, I want you to go back and watch the fucking video at"
"2951380","2951980"," the beginning, please. "
"2952320","2954020"," Please just watch the video at the beginning."
"2954500","2959140"," Then I'll do a class like a legit, like you just come back and look when you're finding, looking"
"2959140","2959980"," for a bottom on Tesla."
"2960460","2961680"," What is bottom on Tesla?"
"2961680","2962920"," How to find bottom on Tesla?"
"2964280","2969900"," Right now it's just, if you're a Tesla bull, you're looking to enter the market. "
"2971160","2977380"," This, the rest of this month, on key dates, during rebalancing, it's been sold off all year long."
"2977640","2978640"," Because it means bottom for Tesla."
"2978860","2982340"," It just means in this rebalancing, you can capitalize on"
"2982340","2991140"," rebalancing on these long only hedge funds. "
"2991140","2992940"," They're like programmed to buy this shit."
"2993140","2994020"," They come back in."
"2994140","2995120"," They've been selling it all year long. "
"2995120","2996620"," They're like, we're going to buy a bottom down here."
"2997800","2999780"," So if you can capitalize on that, have at it."
"3000180","3000820"," It's a perspective. "
"3001200","3005640"," We'll go back briefly to Spyro quick because we're going to have a little chat about Spy right"
"3005640","3005900"," here."
"3009480","3010120"," I'll go back."
"3010260","3012580"," I cleaned up the chart on Spy so that we can start over again. "
"3013220","3016300"," The reason being is we're looking for a reversal."
"3017080","3018860"," This is not really a chart right here, okay?"
"3019260","3021000"," What is the key you into this, okay?"
"3022260","3023580"," It's not really a chart on the Spy."
"3023800","3027680"," If you're looking for the Spy to come back down here and retest these lows at one at three five"
"3027680","3033680"," forty eight, if you're looking for that weekly moving average to get retested down here for doom"
"3033680","3034000"," and gloom. "
"3034000","3041360"," If you like Chase, why you all to know that I love Chase, but Chase is like, hey, I want"
"3041360","3042300"," to roll this market over."
"3043340","3044220"," Bears are pissed."
"3046040","3047520"," You know, you look down here, right?"
"3047940","3049700"," You guys remember what the talk was down here. "
"3049760","3050480"," We're getting a market crash."
"3050500","3051160"," We didn't get it."
"3051760","3053520"," It's going way back to the 13th of October. "
"3053560","3054800"," I made a big post on this."
"3055380","3057580"," I said, buy right here, buy, buy, buy."
"3058880","3060820"," People are like, fuck no cap. "
"3061320","3062800"," And I was like, yes, you buy here."
"3063720","3068260"," And people were pissed and either pissed because we were in ultra oversold conditions."
"3069600","3072460"," And they were like, fuck you, Cap, we're going down even deeper. "
"3072760","3075820"," It's going to be doom and gloom and sure enough got right back up."
"3077300","3082120"," And you know, we proceeded for, you know, a month and a half."
"3082360","3086840"," And how many times did we say, that's it crash time, that's it crash time. "
"3087360","3088640"," That's it crash time."
"3089160","3090360"," That's it crash time."
"3090560","3096600"," And this one specifically is a big bear old school charting pattern where you get the straight"
"3096600","3098020"," bloodbath out of the depths of hell. "
"3099380","3101080"," And that's what they're looking for right here."
"3103100","3105140"," And you've heard it and heard it and heard it and heard it."
"3105240","3110600"," So just the key on this, okay, is when we get these moves down, you want to be looking as"
"3110600","3114020"," a trader and investor, you know, when you see these moves, right?"
"3114020","3118320"," These hourly changes, they're giant, right?"
"3119100","3121880"," The giant moves down in the market. "
"3122640","3128400"," And the bears are looking for that hourly change to get that monster move down."
"3128580","3129260"," Do you see that there?"
"3129640","3133820"," They want to see these moving averages come back over."
"3134560","3143180"," I'm going to say to you that if you're a day trader, if you're a weekly trader or you know,"
"3143220","3144680"," how much time do you spend here, a month and a half?"
"3145920","3150900"," So these bears are looking for this break here to confirm this reversal. "
"3151180","3153820"," This is this will get rid of your elf rally."
"3153820","3155400"," And there's some problems in here."
"3156320","3158460"," We've got some option positioning now. "
"3158560","3164140"," We've got a lot of pop puts came in yesterday in the market, but you really want to see the"
"3164140","3168920"," bears need to see this if the bears don't see is that there's some problems between now and Friday"
"3168920","3175460"," this Friday where the market is kind of kind of like pinned in here where it can't break through."
"3176540","3183200"," So I really want the bears really want to see a break and a break below here, at least by"
"3183200","3189420"," Friday close that they want to get that close on Friday to open the trap door to start trading down"
"3189420","3193920"," and have a have a bloody Christmas or a bloody holiday or whatever they have you."
"3193960","3195100"," If they can't do this, right?"
"3195980","3203500"," You're going to see some some some trades higher into today and possibly tomorrow. "
"3203500","3203980"," Okay."
"3204460","3205360"," So just be aware."
"3205540","3209040"," This is the last of the elf rally chance is right here. "
"3210330","3216480"," The short for bears is right here or was or is right here."
"3217040","3222920"," You close your trade here and you re-pick it back up once you break 390 I want to be"
"3222920","3223420"," clear on that."
"3223420","3223640"," Okay. "
"3223860","3227360"," So if you're trading level level down, it tells the bear bulls all the time."
"3227960","3236140"," You want to get this break below 390 you want to get this break below, right?"
"3236620","3240280"," You want to get these moving averages over, right?"
"3241340","3246020"," And then what you do is you can finally say we've broken trend."
"3247040","3250100"," We've had some rejection here, right?"
"3250640","3252520"," And you can confidently be a bear at this point. "
"3252520","3255220"," You can confidently walk around and say, hey, fuck you bull."
"3256020","3258040"," We are we've changed trends, man."
"3258320","3260640"," We changed the hourly trend to get out of here. "
"3261360","3265600"," And you really do start to look for these much lower loads."
"3266380","3272680"," You start and open the door up to this 375 down below here is a gorgeous trade free money as"
"3272680","3272920"," a bear."
"3273540","3278420"," You get the next level down here free money as a bear free money as a bear down below here. "
"3278420","3283740"," This is your key level for a bear, 348, 27 to open the door to lower lows."
"3284100","3288520"," I don't think I can do a let me see if I can do a weekly moving average here on"
"3288520","3288840"," this chart."
"3289000","3293920"," I'm not sure if I can and you can see that 200 here. "
"3294540","3299500"," This is the weekly moving averages blue line and you can see how where it lines up in here with"
"3299500","3300780"," this white box down here, right?"
"3301340","3306920"," This is where you open the trap door to some serious stuff going on the market if you can break."
"3306920","3308340"," So this is the trade right here."
"3308500","3310080"," This is the trade right here, right?"
"3310880","3314060"," So each one of these you take the money off the table. "
"3314360","3317300"," You make sure that we're still going down, right?"
"3318040","3322420"," And if this is where the meat of the trade is in here, right, then you take the profit here"
"3322420","3329380"," and you look for that next part of smashing down below this low this breaking a new lower low."
"3329760","3333900"," And then we start start doing some real some real serious fucking damage in here."
"3335320","3336960"," 3200 opens the door to 3200. "
"3338020","3342020"," You're going to look for another rejection up high and then come back down and start getting down"
"3342020","3345180"," at these low low low low numbers, okay?"
"3346580","3353220"," So I want you to see all this here and the blood that should be coming."
"3353380","3354820"," We should be getting some blood coming up here."
"3355020","3356440"," I want to see that 390 get broken. "
"3357300","3359440"," I don't I don't think it happens until Friday."
"3359440","3360220"," I'll be honest with you."
"3360700","3368000"," I think that in my mind, I don't think that it happens until Monday. "
"3370080","3376980"," You've seen you've seen a breakdown right now, 39135 bears want to see this new low, even if they"
"3376980","3382280"," just tag it and come back up, it's this is how you when they talk about opening the door to"
"3382280","3385920"," lower lows, they want to see this new low, right?"
"3386740","3391820"," And you're opening the door now to to the bloodbath that's coming down the road."
"3393760","3403710"," And we'll start plugging in some we'll start plugging in some levels right now for for the"
"3403710","3403930"," spy."
"3409790","3419130"," Isn't that is that crazy how you can just you can just move it over from Tesla to make sure"
"3419130","3420690"," I got the previous low here, right?"
"3420690","3423470"," I'm going to tag some previous lows here and get rid of this. "
"3423850","3425970"," You guys get the you guys get the gist here, right?"
"3426730","3433230"," You're watching support diminish on Tesla, or excuse me on spy, but just broke a previous low here."
"3434250","3439670"," And we're looking to break some more previous lows, you got another one right there and on a"
"3439670","3445390"," monthly, so as you begin to make this rollover, we're going to start to look for these previous"
"3445390","3445810"," lows."
"3446410","3447930"," I'm going to throw another one in right here. "
"3447930","3455770"," This is the last one, 39 D03, right down there, this is what the bears are looking for to this"
"3455770","3457710"," is that green box that I had, right?"
"3458370","3464110"," Bears want to get this this new low down here so that they can start to trade this gap down"
"3464110","3464310"," here."
"3464310","3469530"," You see this gap down below, and we'll put some more in down below to places of interest."
"3474680","3482110"," This one down here, so you guys are following along as time passes. "
"3482110","3487950"," You can do this on your own charts, and we'll start to draw in a hole on here."
"3489490","3498620"," Pivot point was 440 this morning, oh excuse me, 440 right there,"
"3505820","3514480"," and shocker there's a there's a gap now, shocker."
"3524530","3533830"," That's a beautiful pivot, bears are in control, get the first support is 39531,"
"3537960","3543180"," and we'll start to break below. "
"3543420","3548100"," I'm going to show you guys some market profile stuff, starting to squeeze right below in iceberg"
"3548100","3557760"," right now, 38531, 391, 21, right there,"
"3558280","3565980"," that is R2, and then we've got another one right here, and 38612,"
"3566420","3576700"," right there, I'll"
"3585150","3590450"," put the news on in the background so you guys can hear me for hair, the news, whatever doom they"
"3590450","3590610"," got."
"3596470","3609290"," Now bring up a book map if you want to see it, and bring up"
"3609290","3610430"," book map real quick for you."
"3616220","3622660"," I should see a bounce here, and our three will draw that one in. "
"3638640","3641680"," This is the low down here that bears want."
"3653280","3659800"," So bears want this new low down here, we'll go to a one minute chart so you can see it."
"3667010","3676750"," So bears want to grab this new low down here, it's at 39003, I want to see that one"
"3676750","3683170"," last tag down below here, bears need this, they have to have this new low, not want, they have to"
"3683170","3686570"," have this new low right here, this one right here, they have to have it. "
"3688190","3694030"," This is the algo stuff, right, the algos want to, you guys are ever watching how computers trade"
"3694030","3698590"," the stock market, they're always wanting to tag these levels down here, if they don't tag it,"
"3698590","3700130"," they're going to come back for it, does that make sense?"
"3700970","3706630"," Trade down to these levels looking for supply or demand, they'll be like, hey, is there demand here"
"3706630","3706990"," or not?"
"3707470","3709430"," If there is, we'll head back higher, does that make sense?"
"3710170","3712830"," If there's no demand, we'll keep heading down until we find some demand."
"3715370","3725660"," And then we'll look above and start plugging in some levels for the above"
"3725660","3735460"," move, if there's demand down there, which I don't think there is but, okay, let me see, 40450,"
"3735920","3745880"," I don't think I've ever come back here, but whatever, 450, we might come back for that tech"
"3745880","3755360"," gap at some point, there's a nice little juicy gap right here, 40959,"
"3755980","3766760"," and then one more, 41359,"
"3769060","3769600"," right there."
"3781360","3783960"," How are y'all doing, y'all ready for a holiday?"
"3785880","3791000"," I hope everybody's doing well, I don't know what y'all celebrate, but if you don't celebrate, you"
"3791000","3800200"," can at least maybe get some time away from the market as the market rolls up, as it gets quiet,"
"3800320","3805640"," hopefully it should get quiet, if the market does start to crash, you guys should see it finish by"
"3805640","3810860"," the 24th, or at least that's what everyone would expect, would finish by the 24th. "
"3811040","3820920"," Still only hit 3930, now not quite a breakdown here, bears, bears need to get, bears need"
"3820920","3827920"," to get a slightly lower here, bears need to break, I might buy some fucking calls, hold on a"
"3827920","3844820"," second, you goddamn"
"3844820","3859840"," bears can't buy the, can't, can't break the new low, I'm gonna buy some calls, hold on, bears,"
"3860380","3861580"," do you see this?"
"3862840","3869040"," You guys have been trying for an entire month to break this and you can't break a new low, what"
"3869040","3869620"," are you doing?"
"3872800","3874060"," What are you doing?"
"3874240","3883250"," Dude, look at how cheap calls are right now, oh wait baby, alright, so if I'm gonna buy some calls"
"3883250","3885450"," here, what am I looking for, do you guys know what I'm looking for?"
"3886510","3893450"," This is insane, I can't believe this is happening on the spy right now, so I'm gonna be looking for"
"3893450","3902270"," two couple things, and we're looking for some volume on this bar, and it's pretty good million, a"
"3902270","3912010"," million, let me look down here a little bit further, bears, come on"
"3912010","3921830"," dude, it's still not green yet, still waiting, bears are"
"3921830","3925970"," trying to pound this down right now, I wanna see this bar turn green on the 15 minute chart, but"
"3925970","3935950"," look at this last bar here, this 5 minute bar, that's 1.2 million dollars,"
"3936090","3943950"," it's something, bulls are trying, I'm still not convinced, I wanna see like 3 million on the 5"
"3943950","3950510"," minute, and maybe like 5 to 15 million on the 15 minute, but bears, dude, you gotta pound it down"
"3950510","3957770"," here, you gotta get 39303, seriously, still no new low on the spy,"
"3958290","3972730"," guys are killing me out there, 393,"
"3973170","3983170"," I might wanna buy"
"3983170","3988870"," some calls here, if we can get above this R2 and buy some, I know they're gonna try to come"
"3988870","3994750"," off this right here and tee back off this VWAP here, here's your VWAP right here, is where bears"
"3994750","4001450"," gonna wanna, bears gonna reverse this all the way down and plunge below, maybe I'll wait for us to"
"4001450","4007530"," get above VWAP, I don't know if I trust the bears right now, just keep your eyes on this VWAP,"
"4007910","4016470"," these bears, bears like you ain't getting any higher,"
"4017330","4034060"," this is fucking savage bears, bears are"
"4034060","4046920"," trying to, we need the plunge protection team to come in, these are"
"4046920","4050700"," bears get serious, they're like, bears get serious in days like today, they're like fuck you, we're"
"4050700","4059540"," going down, like you had your time, you had a month, you had your FOMC, you had your chance,"
"4060140","4069970"," so it all, there's a trade in here, you gotta be careful as a bull"
"4069970","4077490"," is like a, you know there's a trade here, if you can get above R2, but if you can't get"
"4077490","4087550"," above R2 they're gonna try to smash it down here, so alright, give me a second here, check"
"4087550","4094970"," one two check, I can hear it on that side, yeah it's probably, I wouldn't be, I'm not a call"
"4094970","4101149"," bar here, if you wanna be bullish on the day you need to get above VWAP right here, they're gonna"
"4101149","4106290"," try to sell this fucking mark, they're trying right now, I don't know if they can, there's some, I"
"4106290","4113470"," mean if they have real money selling they could but, yeah, you guys need to get this man, bears"
"4113470","4119870"," need this, this is the key for low, this is the key for trying to change, it's like the first"
"4119870","4126970"," key, you get the first key, you break through the previous low where we are and then you get the"
"4126970","4136819"," change change in the early, so let's talk about VIX too, so you should still get,"
"4137319","4145220"," let's talk about VIX, so you guys know a little bit about VIX okay, you should not see, so the"
"4145220","4151040"," VIX right, well let's talk about the VIX real quick, you guys wanna talk about the VIX, so you can"
"4151040","4161010"," see why the VIX isn't high right now and when to see the VIX start going up, you"
"4161010","4167330"," should see VIX start to go up if this lower low is broken and held, it'll go up a little"
"4167330","4175649"," bit, you're not gonna see the VIX start to climb though until you break below like 385 I think,"
"4175970","4182910"," you'll start to see the VIX getting higher and then you're not gonna see the VIX get crazy until"
"4182910","4191670"," you start to break the previous low I think at 348 or 350, so you're not gonna get that VIX,"
"4192069","4202010"," so that thing that 45, that's according to Nikhai, you'd expect that 45 if we hold under the weekly"
"4202010","4208050"," moving average, I think that's 348 or 352, and we start to head lower, then we start to see the"
"4208050","4212770"," VIX from like 30 to 40 above, TIX right allows you to actually hear order flame futures, forex and"
"4212770","4218450"," stock instruments, get a free trial at TIX right dot com, you shouldn't, you shouldn't see the VIX"
"4218450","4228280"," get that high until then, you need, there's a, you can look at, if you check the"
"4228280","4233980"," VIX chart against the whole year, this market's been bought, there's, so there's, if you look on"
"4233980","4243660"," the, on the market breadth indicator, right, unless we get it below 30% bullishness, let me show"
"4243660","4253080"," you guys the stuff, well it's like on the market breadth indicator price sector, you won't see us"
"4253080","4259860"," get, like when they say people are under heads, they usually stay under heads to like 50 to 30%"
"4259860","4266580"," of a sector being bought, and then below then is when you start to see the panic kick in, and"
"4266580","4271180"," you'll see the VIX really start to rise, not typically you won't see the VIX start to get crazy"
"4271180","4278220"," until then, and that was the point behind the first part of the year of 2022, the VIX was going"
"4278220","4286420"," crazy, the first two plunges that we had, first two big ones, VIX cranked, but you're not going to"
"4286420","4290720"," see that in this, there's an accumulation phase that's going on in the market, or has been going on"
"4290720","4295840"," since June, July, there at the bottom was bought, and then the bottom was bought again in October,"
"4296920","4304260"," so until we get underneath that June, October love those at that June October levels, you won't see"
"4304260","4311440"," typically the VIX go back up to like 45, you want to start to see those bottoms get broken, and"
"4311440","4318500"," then you'll start to see the ramp and VIX, but not until that point, take that with a, that's"
"4318500","4328420"," not financial you shouldn't see the"
"4328420","4337560"," VIX up there until we break below those two levels and start heading lower with conviction, and"
"4337560","4342760"," that was, and that's the reason the VIX got there too is because he broke through levels or, or, or"
"4342760","4348680"," trend up in 2021, so you start breaking that trend, that's when you start to see VIX go wild,"
"4348680","4358580"," usually, usually not always, yeah, I've got a"
"4358580","4362060"," hedge on for S now, I have a big one though, I sold out a bunch of it, I have"
"4362060","4369420"," my, my position is really small, but I have a, I still have some on for March 17th I think,"
"4369520","4376640"," or 19th somewhere in there, I'm not looking at it, I'm just gonna talk some prayers baby, talk some"
"4376640","4383180"," prayers, and the reason being is because the Dow did very well, right, if you're gonna, if you're"
"4383180","4389320"," gonna short anything, what's been, what's been doing great, so, and that's that end of the year,"
"4389480","4393820"," rebalance, right, where's that money gonna go, I asked that on Twitter a couple times, I was like,"
"4394060","4400760"," we know that the money was hiding in REITs, we knew that the money then went to the Dow, this"
"4400760","4406860"," is the money that pension funds are in, we know that there's money right now in, in the XLU, right,"
"4407100","4413680"," we know XLU was just pumping the past couple weeks, right, so you know that these portfolio"
"4413680","4419960"," managers will shift their money around the market into anything that's been oversold, that's what I"
"4419960","4429640"," was asking yesterday on Twitter, I was saying, if you can find sectors or individual tickers"
"4429640","4437580"," that have been sold down for the entire year, like who had the worst years, and which tickers had"
"4437580","4441140"," the worst years, but they're not shit stocks, we're not looking at shit stocks here, we're looking"
"4441140","4446120"," for, what have they been selling all year long, where can they hide their money, they still have to"
"4446120","4451260"," buy this market, so you have to kind of like seek out where they buying, and then the next week"
"4451260","4457860"," or two, you want to see like volume buying ramps into these sectors and volume buying ramps into"
"4457860","4464620"," these stocks, now they don't necessarily care if they go down for a month or two, they care about a"
"4464620","4473560"," year later, they're looking at it from a year perspective, I think that it's TLT, I think that"
"4473560","4481880"," we've been talking about TLT, right, we'll look at it right now, I think that it's TLT and shocker,"
"4482400","4494220"," look at TLT, holding up this fine, you're seeing, I'm"
"4494220","4500980"," going to do and just fine today, why is TLT doing fine today, let's say at HYG, right, HYG selling"
"4500980","4507060"," off, what is this telling you, that is telling you that risky bets are not the play right now,"

"6007510","6013870"," annoying thing in the world, it's annoying on the upside too, you don't think bulls were, dude, you"
"6013870","6016870"," don't think bulls were annoyed by this one, you know where this one goes too, you guys know where"
"6016870","6023700"," this is from, you guys want to see it, you want to see where it is, I'm going to show"
"6023700","6035120"," it to you, it's right here, look, you want to see it annoying, I'll show you it annoying, see if"

"6061160","6075080"," here, way back here, see where my cursor is right there, it's gross,"
"6076000","6084560"," go all the way back over here and look at that, just missed it barely, just barely,"
"6085080","6092080"," it's gross, and so they'll do this, they'll like come down here right, boom, all the way up here,"
"6092440","6099320"," right, slam all the way down here and not grab that last little tick right, and they come swinging"
"6099320","6105960"," back to the high again, and what do we have up here, we've got a unclosed gap fill up here"
"6105960","6108660"," at the pivot, isn't that crazy?"
"6111440","6116080"," And so we didn't quite get that one, so we're going all the way down here to get this one,"
"6116180","6119980"," we didn't quite get that one, now we're going to go back up and close the gap, we're going to"
"6119980","6128060"," maybe try back down here again, you see how these are computers work, this isn't humans doing this"
"6128060","6133420"," shit, this is computers in the background doing this shit, it's kind of gross, there's real money"
"6133420","6140500"," selling and real money buying that affect this as well, and there's like market or market sentiment"
"6140500","6150360"," can affect this, and options market can affect this stuff, but that's part of what you're looking"
"6150360","6159760"," for is that break, 3903, and 3905 is another one, it's like 3905,"
"6160060","6170540"," 3903, it's kind of gross, isn't it, kind of nasty, infuriates"
"6170540","6179920"," traders, bulls and bears, it's like totally infuriating, and you can actually do this before it"
"6179920","6183540"," happens, you can look back and cut time and go, okay, so there's that one, there's this one,"
"6183580","6199230"," there's this one, and you'll see the market trades to them, there's like a magnet, trading"
"6199230","6205770"," up into VWAP here, you want to see the bears hold VWAP here, and try to get that tick below"
"6205770","6211970"," and see VWAP right here, bears going to want to maintain VWAP here, two places of bears to try to"
"6211970","6217670"," take this trade right here, and this 200 will be another place to be looking at to try to roll"
"6217670","6224390"," this down, and finally get the bears want this new low down below here, we are in negative gamma,"
"6224970","6235650"," we do have some funky stuff going on with the options market for OPEX on Friday, they leave"
"6235650","6239770"," gaps behind, but will sometimes come back for them eventually, they say that eventually we come"
"6239770","6256780"," back for them, gaps get closed frequently, but they don't have to be closed, three,"
"6256880","6262660"," nine, five, eight's looking for right above here, bears looking to take this right here, we'll see"
"6262660","6271710"," if bears can get back in charge again, someone's asking about the the difference, so what you have"
"6271710","6276770"," to do is there's there are different contracts on the futures contract and the cash market"
"6276770","6286190"," contract, and the futures contract will will fluctuate and the difference in price between cash and"
"6286190","6292350"," futures, GLOBEX, so you just do it, you just take both numbers, subtract them, find the difference,"
"6292350","6302070"," and then you can figure it out, and I like MES on levels because those standing by sellers tend"
"6302070","6309090"," to be clearer than they are on the data that you get for cash market spy, we used to watch"
"6309090","6316150"," cash market spy, and they just had like levels at the zeros and fives, so I really didn't tell you"
"6316150","6321330"," where the actual buyers and sellers were, it's a little bit more clear on MES where the buyers and"
"6321330","6330680"," sellers are, I love Mero, so you guys know Mero's a professional you guys all know he's a"
"6330680","6341000"," professional, he's a real, he works in a hedge fund, okay,"
"6341000","6345920"," then notice really how often major levels have that run, yeah, they will be safely restarting"

"6384000","6393980"," at spy, and I'm looking for different things, so ES, typically we'll show you the stretch, or"
"6393980","6403200"," the true range of the Spyder products, especially spy, or S&P 500 itself, like SPX spy, yes, ES"
"6403200","6409140"," will show you the stretch where spy won't show you that, and you'll be like oh I've drawn a channel"
"6409140","6414600"," on spy, and why are we not staying in that channel, usually because ES has that bigger channel, or"
"6414600","6422520"," smaller, or high lows, and then SPX what I really like about SPX, when I look at SPX charts, is"
"6422520","6427220"," the same reason I use NDX charts, so we'll look at NDX first, so if you're trading the queues,"
"6428340","6438240"," we're trading the US 100 or whatever, or NQ, or the NQ mini, I always"
"6438240","6447860"," like looking for trend on NDX, I'm going to look at NDX,"
"6448540","6454040"," I used to try to trade the queues right, and I would be like man I suck at trading the"
"6454040","6462480"," queues, and how do I clear this chart, delete all, yep, okay, so we're going to look, so I'm going"
"6462480","6470780"," to set these up for the next month or one to three months, like so now January to January into,"
"6471700","6476660"," we're going to look at all these charts, we're going to look at a bunch of different indexes, some"
"6476660","6485180"," major tickers, and so this is the NDX chart, this chart trades really slow, and SPX trades really"
"6485180","6492020"," slow as well, it gives you a better, NDX and SPX give you like a better feel for where real"
"6492020","6500160"," levels are, and how we trade from level to level over time, okay, or at least in my experience, so"
"6500160","6507900"," we're going to look right now, we're going to just take a quick look at NDX, this is the month"
"6507900","6513980"," of November right here, right, and I'm going to be looking for where where demand, we think demand"
"6513980","6521620"," is, and where we think sellers are, we're going to make it pretty simple right, that you're going"
"6521620","6530320"," to expect smart money down here, or you think you're pausing and you're taking a decent guess"
"6530320","6539040"," saying, I'm going to expect buyers down here between or some kind of support down here,"
"6539420","6549160"," between 1043, right, and 10100, I'm going to assume that people bought this"
"6549160","6558560"," market or bought NDX down here, and you've seen sellers come in about right, you know that you've"
"6558560","6565820"," got sellers here, you've got sellers here, you've got sellers here, you've got sellers here, and"
"6565820","6569620"," all these buyers are trying to take the money and run, they bought it again, right, bought it"
"6569620","6575680"," again, again, and we're trying to kind of get back down to this level, this is what the bears want"
"6575680","6584620"," to get to, right, and break below this 10400, right, we know this is where the sellers are teed"
"6584620","6593590"," off, we know this is where major sellers are above,"
"6594050","6603940"," right, the sellers are, we know that there's buyers"
"6603940","6610520"," came up here, right, gap this whole thing straight up, buyers are boom, buyers are boom, buyers are"
"6610520","6617240"," boom, right, you want to see if you're a bear, you want to see these buyers right here break below"
"6617240","6625780"," these buyers, you're seeing that right now, you're actually seeing NDX weak, and you're seeing,"
"6625880","6632440"," you're seeing support for NDX fail right now, right, and see this, it's a beautiful new low on NDX,"
"6633200","6642940"," we'll look at a one-hour chart, a broken trend on NDX, you see how came up, came"
"6642940","6648100"," down, right, we just ripped, right, came right down this area of support down here, the buyers came"
"6648100","6654140"," right back in, bought it back up, we had the break below trend, right, buyers bought it right back"
"6654140","6659920"," up, sent it up higher, some sellers, right, tried it one more time, two times, three times, came"
"6659920","6665480"," into the event, failure, right, so we're about to break through, this is actually really negative"
"6665480","6671640"," on tech, so if you're, you're seeing this break below this trend change, right, on the one hour"
"6671640","6676220"," you're going to start to see the one hour start to curl over here, and want to go back down"
"6676220","6680960"," to where support is, and we knew that there was some support here, right, right, on right on the"
"6680960","6686960"," 200, on the 1 hour, and we're not finding that support right now, right, so we're going, we're"
"6686960","6691380"," going to be looking for where is, where was last time we found support, it's much lower, so we have"
"6691380","6698820"," a break on NDX, right, the buyers want to hold this break on NDX now and turn this support into"
"6698820","6704840"," resistance for a leg down here, so this is very productive for bears, you want to be seeing this,"
"6704940","6712800"," you're seeing money leave risk assets right now in NDX, and we're going to snap in some support and"
"6712800","6721340"," resistance here for NDX, just to see where it's at, okay, some minor levels for bears to be"
"6721340","6735000"," targeting, that one right there, right"
"6735000","6749950"," there is a push, right there is a push, right"
"6749950","6759990"," there is a push, and right there, right where that green line is, you see how, put"
"6759990","6769930"," that green line there, to be watching this, this is bearish, bearish, it's"
"6769930","6775130"," turning over now, look for this tag down below, and what do we really want to see is, we want"
"6775130","6784110"," to see, we're going to look at our year here, and go back farther in time, what do you start"
"6784110","6791110"," to see here, start to see this, see this all this area of consolidation back here, you can see that"
"6791110","6794670"," we had demand here, well you guys to see that where I just wrote that band, right, you had"
"6794670","6802550"," consolidation, powerful move up, right, it's a more consolidation here, powerful move up, a tee off"
"6802550","6808690"," for a bull run up here, right, see how strong that is right there, I'm going to see that stuff"
"6808690","6816310"," here, okay, and there's not a lot down here, is there, there's not a lot of push, there's one more"
"6816310","6822990"," band down below here, so we'll snap a couple lines in there, and we're going to know here that"
"6822990","6835610"," roughly right there, that's 9500, right,"
"6836750","6844670"," and if we start to break down through here, right, you're going to see actual blood baths down to"
"6844670","6854630"," like 6500, like real nasty shit will happen, so come back to where we are today, and shocker,"
"6855690","6862030"," there's a blue, there's a green box right on it, so this is key for bulls to hold, right, we"
"6862030","6868410"," know that if bulls don't hold this demand zone down here, this is where we'll start to see"
"6868410","6874410"," volatility, right, we already know that there's known, known, support in the market here, if we"
"6874410","6881390"," start to break that known support down here, watch out, we're actually going to raise this up a"
"6881390","6900980"," little bit, or down, put that one right there, and we're going to put some minor, or we"
"6900980","6927400"," broke that one, break that one right there, okay,"
"6927520","6937700"," so we did MDX, trades slower, easier to see levels, agree"
"6937700","6943640"," with that statement, 100%, and I use that on, I use that in SPX all the time, I love SPX,"
"6943780","6949940"," SPX, I just don't trade it, I just chart it, that's it, I just try to spy for the money,"

"6960520","6969960"," Chase, you're so close brother, so close, so close Chase, if you taste it Chase,"
"6970420","6980390"," that's right there man, it's so close, so close brother, bears are out there getting lubed up right"
"6980390","6996050"," now, they're like we want a new low, if you want it so bad, I"
"6996050","7000990"," fucking, we're totally edging right, if you're a bear you got to be edging, if you want this so bad"
"7000990","7005950"," right here, it's not even funny, we can go back and look and see, I think this is the previous"
"7005950","7015990"," low, this would be the new lowest low right down here, it's totally edging isn't it, you"
"7024600","7030520"," can break, so the other thing you'd be looking for here is like waterfall puts coming in to the"
"7030520","7040240"," market, then you could break through here, but this is where shore would take his money right,"
"7040500","7045920"," where would a shore, where'd a shore cost $1,000,000 reopen 20 year bonds on December 21st to"
"7045920","7052100"," settle on January 3rd, here, hold on a second, so where do the, let's ask yourselves, where do the"
"7052100","7057460"," short start here, so, yeah they do have it on, I always forget that they have it on this one,"
"7061790","7071290"," so this is, so 23, 38% retracement is right where that gap is, is see that,"
"7071530","7080950"," so you get the short that started way up here, and you can expect some kind of retracement at least"
"7080950","7085710"," right at some point, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, you might not get the retracement, sometimes"
"7085710","7092450"," they'll stay short, $4 billion in three month bills, and the 7.9% is, settle on December 27, and"
"7092450","7102570"," the US to settle $45 billion in six month bills on December 19th to settle on December 22nd, come"
"7103950","7112430"," on, we get rid of this bullshit, so this will be the, so our one's about 23% retracement, our"
"7112430","7122740"," two is the 38% retracement from down here, do"
"7122740","7133550"," you want to see if it's exact, we'll look at what an exact retracement would be, hopefully not"

"7210520","7224200"," Weirdos, what"
"7224200","7226820"," happened with, what happened with Darius Dale?"
"7230860","7235940"," No, you just, this is a, this is a pretty decent run right here for, for the short, so you"
"7235940","7242000"," take the short off, wait for a retracement and then retake the short again, the Elliott Weirdos are"

"7272710","7283060"," right, talk about the edging, like this is a ridiculous edging if you're a bear right, yeah, this"
"7283060","7288100"," seems like a reasonable, like, I think we can hit this down here, like there's a fair chance that"
"7288100","7295900"," you'll hit this either today or tomorrow, but to get a retracement up to the R1 is your, is your"
"7295900","7298620"," 28, right, is that right?"
"7298840","7305360"," And then the, I think the 38 is a point of control, it's roughly in there, so you're going to"
"7305360","7311140"," be looking for a retracement at some point either, you know, like if we tag this, you're going to"
"7311140","7319840"," be looking for retracement here, dollar drops, one spot, 7% to one spot, two to one spot says, so"
"7319840","7324200"," I don't like Elliott's stuff because you get like extensions, if you like you're expecting this,"
"7324200","7329620"," but then we blast through this and then you like, I don't disagree with Elliott's stuff, but it's"
"7329620","7339480"," not an exact science because I shouldn't say Elliott waves good stuff, it's, people get wrapped up"
"7339480","7343600"," in it and you end up getting torched or you weren't in long enough for whatever, there are other"
"7343600","7351920"," market conditions that can go against like these exact numbers, I shouldn't say weirdos, I like"

"7545880","7555860"," market takes, I like listening to him on his interview by the people, I like him a lot you're going"
"7555860","7562980"," to break it right now, so you have a new we're coming in, you're going to see people on and"
"7562980","7571680"," we're about to get a new low right now, just tagged 39006, I think 305 was the daytime low, we'll"
"7571680","7581570"," look at it right now and see where it is, oh, see we can find it and you'll see"
"7581570","7586910"," market technicians are always looking for this stuff, they always want to see where that WTO says"
"7586910","7593670"," China initiates WTO dispute complaint targeting US semiconductor chip measures, where is it, I"

"7604880","7614460"," to find it here, it's way back here, you see it, it's right here, it's back on November"
"7614460","7624200"," 17th and you can see it right here, right before the opening"
"7624200","7634020"," bell 3903 there's a couple more here, this is 390 or 3914 in the"
"7634020","7638980"," actual cash market, some people ask you count the one right before the open, I tend to not like"
"7638980","7646760"," counting it, I like to count it when the options market is in here, but 39003 is that previous low,"
"7647620","7651520"," you could, you know, this is close enough for hand grenades and horse shoes that you call that"
"7651520","7661520"," broken at this point, but you can see it right here, right, watch them come down into it and this"
"7661520","7669380"," is that whole move being erased, this is that whole run or consolidation move"
"7669380","7677680"," and you can see it better, so if you're just looking at it, it's way back here, right, this entire"
"7677680","7683740"," move is being a right, this is called the racing a move, we just erased a move and so bears"
"7683740","7690560"," are wanting this because there's not much back here, you see this, it's a giant squeeze up, some of"
"7690560","7697180"," it happened not in cash market and why do you want to break this is because this opens a giant"
"7697180","7703780"," door down below, so this will end up turning into red right here, right, this yellow will turn into"
"7703780","7709420"," red, there's one hold it and trade this down into this new low down below, this is a monster move"
"7709420","7715440"," down, right, they want to grind down through this level, these levels, you want to look to find out"
"7715440","7720940"," where these levels are once you break through and where did they get bought, they got bought right"
"7720940","7730900"," here, right, got bought right here, got bought right here, right, as I'll see all that, and they"
"7730900","7735260"," want to break through this so they can open the door for this next trade down, this is what they're"
"7735260","7740900"," looking for, looking to lay off the short and then take the short back down for this giant move"

"7782240","7789870"," You got it Chase, you guys can't hear me?"
"7790210","7798110"," Try refreshing, yeah, try to refresh and look at we're going to have it happen right now, it's"
"7798110","7799630"," going to happen right now you guys watching it. "
"7800590","7806470"," Okay so there's the thick strike, you have a new low on the S&P 500, the entire move has"
"7806470","7812850"," been erased at this point, bears are now firmly in control of the market going down,"
"7813830","7823010"," congratulations bears, you did it, just broke right below right there, good job, so we'll change"
"7823010","7835400"," this to bears got the new low, you see how we're just creeping down to touch it too, you see"
"7835400","7841440"," how it's just like, you see how it's just little tiny touches just trying to break it right there,"
"7855320","7860100"," so this is what I'm going to tell you now, this is the scary part of your bull, this is"
"7860100","7867620"," the place where we can have a bloodbath, you ready for the bloodbath?"
"7871540","7887510"," This is where blood baths are born, right down here to 386-12, star bloodbath in it, I"
"7887510","7890550"," think we had, what did I say, what did I say the,"
"7890690","7899730"," what did I"
"7899730","7916270"," say the red blood, let it bleed, give me the blood, right, close"
"7916270","7924150"," the gap lower, it's not going to happen, I don't think but just give me bright red blood down here"
"7924150","7934120"," and fill it all in, you're probably not going to get it, I'll say, I think"
"7934120","7944300"," I wrote it earlier where it should be, I'll retrace it one more time, you"
"7944300","7957440"," guys are savages, get these fucking bears all fired up, okay hold on, should"
"7957440","7966420"," be right there, it's right where we are right now, anything over this, should go, wait a minute,"
"7966560","7976260"," hold on a second, let me make sure I got this right, right there,"
"7976900","7988790"," I have that right, you"

"8066210","8074270"," a bull and you think we're getting a Christmas rally, it's probably over for you, so your Christmas"
"8074270","8080690"," rally is more than likely dead, you're going to, even if we extend here, you're going to expect"
"8080690","8086490"," some kind of retracement higher, you're going to be looking for a retracement at some point to our"
"8086490","8093130"," one, if it happens today, our one or the pivot for 38 or 28, 26 or whatever the fuck it"
"8093130","8101990"," is, um, bears are trying to get this dump down to 385, um,"
"8102330","8115810"," hold on, give me a second here, drink some coffee, we"
"8120580","8136960"," got some calls here, I'm just waiting to see if they hold or not, savage"

"8150580","8158680"," Santa rally is pretty much over, you're pretty, your pretty, your Santa rally is over, for it seems"
"8158680","8167280"," like it is, yeah I'm looking for a reached retrace here to at least our one, if not, looking for"
"8167280","8178740"," a retrace, our one, if not, um, pivot, we'll see if we get it, yeah"
"8178740","8185820"," so the, you guys want to talk about the collar today at some point, we can tell about the the"
"8185820","8192400"," collar is weird right now, I'm hearing okay, so I thought it was, I thought the collar was that"
"8194160","8200580"," somebody has to clear this up for me, so the collar, I've seen a lot of people say in the"
"8200580","8210940"," collars only at, um, let me go through and get some exact numbers here, so the,"
"8212820","8222840"," the uh, let me see, where's the, uh, the, the,"
"8222840","8232780"," the, the JPM collar right, this is some significant places, the JPM collar is 38, 35, I"
"8232780","8238200"," don't think that's 11, I think the collar is on until, the US sells 45 billion dollars in four week"
"8238200","8246719"," bills, forecast, bid to cover 3 to 19, a higher yield of 3 spot 65%."
"8246719","8254100"," So the collar is on, I think until December 30th, correct me if I'm wrong, I need to know if"
"8254100","8259379"," I'm wrong on that, because I've seen a lot of, um, just repeat that, prior bid to cover 3 to"
"8259379","8262620"," 19 and prior high yield of 3 spot 65%."
"8262620","8266700"," I gotta keep my eyes, hold on, I'll get you guys, I'm watching this trade because I want to get"
"8266700","8270840"," fucked in this trade, I bought this fucker down here and I don't want to lose it. "
"8272459","8274260"," Oh yeah, baby, I'm making money."
"8276639","8284660"," Okay, so, uh, I gotta put some stops on, hold on."
"8294400","8300760"," Okay, so, um, the JPM collar from my understanding is 30. "
"8300760","8302139"," Thank you."
"8302160","8304299"," Good news in UK inflation figures."
"8305379","8313059"," I had an original lower range of that of like 3,385 or something and then everyone was pushing 38,"
"8313620","8314879"," 35. "
"8317250","8319250"," So I, is there some clarity there?"
"8319790","8329850"," Is like the upper range 38, 35 in the lower range, 33 or 33, 90?"
"8331190","8334790"," I swore originally I thought it was much, much lower."
"8335870","8345870"," And so I know there's different dates, different collars, but, uh, I don't know the"
"8345870","8346150"," answer."
"8346450","8354370"," So, I did post that I thought it was 38, 35 to 37 or 3750 is where the, um, the"
"8354370","8355049"," gap is. "
"8356110","8357990"," So you guys want to know why I wrote 38."
"8358330","8366370"," So 38, 35 is, I think the start of the JPM collar and then there's a gap, um, that needs"
"8366370","8370110"," filled below it to 38, 75, so 3750."
"8373230","8375049"," So you might as well just throw that shit in there. "
"8376670","8377730"," Throw the gap in there."
"8379510","8381209"," Yeah, give me that pump, baby."
"8382629","8383590"," Give me that pump. "
"8385049","8385889"," Make me some money."
"8386129","8387610"," Oh, oh."
"8389110","8389830"," Hold on. "
"8389930","8391110"," I got to raise my stops here."
"8406840","8407380"," Okay."
"8407920","8408880"," You like that?"
"8409160","8410020"," You like that dip by?"
"8411100","8413180"," Give me some fucking dips, bro. "
"8416870","8417410"," Okay."
"8417490","8418450"," So you got 38, 35."
"8426320","8427040"," Got it. "
"8433990","8434950"," So it is 38, 35."
"8435210","8435310"," Okay."
"8438120","8440780"," So I shouldn't be expecting a bloodbath into the 31st. "
"8442300","8446640"," I should expect like some kind of a, maybe that's where you get your, maybe that's where you get"
"8446640","8447340"," your Santa rally."
"8447580","8454880"," Maybe you get the Santa rally now and then they bloodbath into the 31st for the, for the collar and"
"8454880","8457400"," they'll be like, you're welcome or something stupid like that."
"8458120","8458920"," There's your Santa rally. "
"8460900","8463040"," That wouldn't surprise me."
"8464040","8467280"," Ooh, you're riding 400p."
"8467720","8468120"," I don't know. "
"8473100","8476420"," I don't know, I don't know about when you bought them, what the position is when you took it."
"8478600","8479340"," I'm in calls here."
"8479660","8484200"," I'm looking for, I'm looking from here for a retracement of some kind. "
"8485060","8488900"," If we start to roll over again, I've got stops, so I'll take money and run."
"8507900","8509480"," We could, we could go lower today."
"8509820","8511900"," I just don't know how much lower it is. "
"8512400","8515240"," Like most of the trade, I think is done, but I could be wrong."
"8517440","8521860"," There's R3 down below here, uh, 38, 6.12. Two."
"8526960","8528640"," And I'm up on my trade, so I'm good. "
"8530100","8532120"," Just can't have a break right around here."
"8532320","8532660"," 11, so it's an AM Eastern time."
"8532800","8538480"," The US has 45 billion dollars in four week bills, private cover of three to 19 and a prior high"
"8538480","8546540"," yield of three spot, 65%. "
"8553290","8556750"," Yeah, there's a, the move was made already."
"8556950","8559270"," You guys know the move was already taken by banks."
"8559270","8561810"," So I don't know how much deeper it'll go. "
"8562690","8563750"," I could go down here."
"8563930","8569790"," I'm not, I'm not against it going down here, but for the levels and stuff, all the math, it seems"
"8569790","8570570"," like it's over."
"8570730","8572230"," There might be this end trade down here. "
"8572430","8577090"," I'm not going to anti, anti this trade going lower, but the move has pretty much been made at this"
"8577090","8577370"," point."
"8578190","8579710"," You want to see retracement and rejection."
"8581170","8582570"," That's what, that's what you're looking for. "
"8584530","8585950"," Retracement and rejection at this point."
"8587370","8592010"," Not always enough of a probability, high probability that I'll take it."
"8601170","8609250"," And then when we hit those retracements, you'll ask me why am I taking the calls off?"
"8609270","8614110"," And I'll tell you the same reason why I'm taking them off because we're going to expect to"
"8614110","8614850"," rejection on those retracements. "
"8617650","8618190"," We'll see."
"8619310","8622050"," Unless they bloodbath, if they bloodbath that I got to stop on."
"8622230","8625790"," So I'll just be out of the trade. "
"8627490","8628950"," I'm about to get kicked out right now."
"8629510","8630530"," I'm in for 80 cents."
"8630850","8632870"," So we'll see, we'll see if I'm getting kicked out here. "
"8638850","8640150"," It's close, I'm really close."
"8640790","8641610"," Like a penny away."
"8651640","8653360"," I'm about to get pushed out right now. "
"8660970","8662010"," Come on, baby."
"8664770","8666190"," Come on, baby."
"8666430","8666630"," Do it. "
"8667890","8669410"," Don't fucking fail me now."
"8677460","8678620"," Don't fail me now."
"8685240","8686580"," Find me a bottom here. "
"8687220","8687920"," Do your rotation."
"8693120","8695300"," Start trading out your shorts and your puts."
"8698400","8700200"," You know you're going to do it, you dirty dog. "
"8706420","8708940"," If you are long here, make sure you have stops."
"8710200","8712020"," I'll be fucking riding through this if it breaks."
"8712320","8714120"," If we break here, you need to be able to get out. "
"8717200","8723000"," Do not get trapped here long because it can start bloodbath and there's not a whole hell of a lot"
"8723000","8723820"," holding the market up here."
"8730860","8736020"," So this is kind of like right there."
"8736940","8740180"," If you start bloodbath and it through here, you're not going to be able to get out quick enough. "
"8740420","8748360"," So if they trigger your stops down here, you can always enter above, but don't do never ever be"
"8748360","8750020"," taking trades down here and not have a stop."
"8756770","8757210"," Ever."
"8758310","8760130"," Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. "
"8764130","8765970"," You can always re-enter again."
"8770250","8771450"," Don't want me to remain in here."
"8771450","8773870"," I'll meet with the fit to cover ratio. "
"8776390","8777090"," And I'm out."
"8777950","8778710"," I just got triggered out."
"8780790","8782670"," Okay, some flats still in the day. "
"8782890","8783750"," I haven't taken a trade today."
"8783830","8784990"," I was blabbing my mouth all morning."
"8785330","8786850"," I just got triggered just then. "
"8787330","8788930"," I just got kicked out of my fucking trade."
"8790910","8794670"," So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to wait to see if this, if you can get"
"8794670","8797770"," at least a little bit of work here, if I can take this trade."
"8802270","8804390"," Son of a bitch and it's back up to 85 cents. "
"8804510","8806110"," I fucking hate stops being triggered."
"8808270","8815110"," All right, so I'm looking for a bottom to form here and move higher."
"8815350","8818390"," I'm not looking for any more blood here today. "
"8818470","8820550"," We might get it, but I don't think it's going to happen."
"8820930","8824350"," I think this is this is a reasonable bottom."
"8826330","8828910"," And there's a few places for bears to be looking for. "
"8833360","8842220"," You're going to be looking for hands down, protecting this, or that even if this gap gets closed,"
"8842620","8844360"," this is like your last kind of a thing for a bear."
"8845500","8848720"," R1 is another normal place to see rejection."
"8849220","8850580"," And then you've got Vwap here. "
"8850960","8856400"," So if you're a bear, if you're looking, if you're looking for positioning, safe positioning, it's"
"8856400","8865440"," probably at 392.31, 395.29, and 440ish,"
"8865780","8866900"," 499."
"8867620","8869120"," Do I think we can bloodbath it here?"
"8869200","8871540"," I do, but do I think that it's a dangerous trade?"
"8871900","8872080"," I do."
"8872900","8874180"," I tell bulls this, right?"
"8874480","8879160"," You guys know when I talk to bulls, I'm like, like right at top, and I'm like, yeah, I take"
"8879160","8879820"," the money and run. "
"8880800","8884940"," So this doesn't mean we can't trade down here or trade down to 386."
"8886500","8893360"," So we'll see if it does trade down here into the close, or if some kind of a base forms"
"8893360","8893820"," right here."
"8895800","8898500"," Don't feel like you can't take your own trades down to R3. "
"8899260","8900020"," You can do it."
"8900200","8902320"," You can start, you can take a put here or whatever you're going to do."
"8902800","8903500"," Take a short here. "
"8904000","8905820"," Just don't listen to me."
"8906620","8908260"," I don't normally take trades."
"8908480","8909680"," I don't normally take whole trades. "
"8910020","8911980"," I'm like, middle of the trade, and that's it."
"8922060","8923460"," I want to see blood."
"8925000","8927180"," It would be convincing. "
"8927740","8931640"," The one good thing about a breakdown here, I mean, if you want to be real bearish down here, the"
"8931640","8937840"," one good thing about a breakdown here, if you start to see this breakdown here today and real"
"8937840","8942200"," blood, we'll never ever come back to close any of that stuff above."
"8942940","8943780"," We'll be gone."
"8944080","8945360"," It would be just be blood, blood, blood. "
"8946760","8948260"," And then they'll get nasty down here."
"8953430","8956410"," So I can't blame a bear for wanting to come down here today."
"8956590","8957030"," They can be an argument. "
"8957670","8958630"," It's not about 316, 360."
"8959410","8962250"," If you break through this though, you'll see blood."
"8962470","8963290"," I'll warn you of that. "
"8964010","8971870"," High yield, three spots, 7.8, as a bear, 3.78. I'll wait for a break right here."
"8971930","8974210"," US sells $46 billion in foreign bills."
"8974210","8975210"," And you will get this high rate. "
"8975350","8975590"," No problem."
"8975890","8979510"," 7.8 and awards, 78.9. So bearish up high."
"8980450","8982530"," Just look for the confirmation down below. "
"8982810","8983950"," Don't get trapped in here as a bear."
"8985190","8987890"," You can take the majority of this trade will work for you."
"8988210","8988870"," You'll get this. "
"8989070","8990590"," If you break this, you'll get this, I promise."
"8990590","8994760"," And you can see it on."
"8994960","8995900"," You can see it, right?"
"8996260","9001620"," So follow my cursor over here. "
"9002440","9004120"," You don't want to get trapped in this part."
"9005020","9007060"," You want to take the bear trade below it."
"9007180","9007720"," Does that make sense?"
"9008840","9011440"," So you want to grind through all this nonsense here. "
"9011440","9014260"," You don't want to see the market turn up on you."
"9015300","9020000"," You want to grind through this and then take the rest of that bear trade if that makes sense to"
"9020000","9020180"," you."
"9020860","9022420"," And this is reversed for bulls. "
"9022420","9031400"," If this book map chart was upside down, I would have said to you, take the money right here and"
"9031400","9034120"," wait until we break through here so that we can go up, right?"
"9035080","9035960"," Does that make sense?"
"9040050","9042630"," That same same trading up and down doesn't matter."

"9051310","9051790"," There will be blood."
"9051910","9052290"," I trust me."
"9052310","9053590"," If you break through this, there will be blood. "
"9055050","9059210"," It'll be, it'll be one to forget that."
"9059290","9065210"," I'll just be like, yeah, I know you guys love when I do blood, bright red blood into the bell."
"9066550","9069090"," Big old pool of it down here for the bears. "
"9071670","9075310"," Just just taking that bright red bear or bull blood."
"9079430","9082050"," But the reality is this is probably not happening."
"9082050","9084510"," And not today, at least. "
"9084670","9085270"," I don't think it's happening."
"9085650","9089070"," I think you need to get that rejection up here somewhere and then you start making your way down."
"9092650","9099410"," But you never know. "
"9102730","9104310"," Nobody has a real crystal ball."
"9104750","9106270"," I guess some people will say they do, but."
"9108870","9109890"," I'm not looking, dude. "
"9110070","9110890"," Don't show me estau."
"9111210","9112070"," I don't want to look, bro."
"9112810","9114710"," All I want to do is come back. "
"9115050","9116210"," So this is the same as the spread."
"9117810","9119270"," So the call spread, right?"
"9119530","9120210"," You don't look at it."
"9120370","9121730"," You just stop looking at it. "
"9122590","9125670"," You just let it trigger and sell at whatever price you got on there."
"9125810","9127990"," It should be like about 500%."
"9128570","9130170"," You just take the money and run. "
"9133610","9134850"," Don't be looking at that spread."
"9135090","9135810"," Don't be looking at that trade."
"9136110","9137250"," Just keep it in the basement. "
"9138390","9139310"," You lock the door."
"9140550","9142930"," I don't care if you go to the basement and chain yourself to the wall."
"9143830","9147730"," I don't care if you, um, how you do it. "
"9147830","9148810"," But when you take those trades."
"9149730","9150590"," You don't look at them."
"9150870","9151070"," You just. "
"9151790","9152610"," You knew to ask."
"9152750","9153410"," Ask Derek Cote."
"9153410","9154150"," No, he'll tell you. "
"9154910","9155730"," He taught me."
"9155830","9158010"," He just placed that trade and you go to the basement."
"9158110","9159010"," You lock the door. "
"9159150","9160130"," You chain yourself to the wall."
"9160490","9162150"," You turn off all forms of communication."
"9164050","9165790"," Because you know it's going to print eventually. "
"9167870","9169770"," It's going to print fat and heavy."
"9176160","9180740"," Inverse, you guys know there's a, you guys know there's an ETF that someone has on me, right?"
"9181220","9182120"," You guys didn't know that?"
"9184600","9185980"," Uh, who runs it?"
"9186180","9190640"," Um, Quinn invests runs an ETF on trades that I put out there."
"9191140","9192620"," I've been doing it for like two years. "
"9195240","9197080"," He actually has a robot."
"9198100","9204640"," He has an algorithm that tracks my posts when I use specific keys."
"9205920","9207780"," And he was, I don't do some. "
"9208020","9208720"," I'm live streaming now."
"9208820","9210000"," So don't post enough on Twitter."
"9212200","9214660"," Uh, but I used to post it like right where we are today. "
"9214840","9220060"," I would post long spy here or do this or this ticker."
"9220080","9221600"," I used to do a lot of stock trading."
"9222220","9224480"," So he would follow all these trades I put out. "
"9225780","9227040"," I haven't done it this year."
"9227540","9229660"," So, but you guys are getting it."
"9229780","9232280"," In the next newsletter, you guys are going to get stock pick stuff. "
"9233340","9235880"," And you get charts and why you should long them away."
"9236100","9237460"," You should short them and all that kind of stuff."
"9244450","9249610"," Yeah, these these trades pay like these trades pay this is what gives me bad trades to make. "
"9250570","9252590"," So I can make a bad trade on a day trade."
"9253070","9255770"," Well, I can lose my money on day trade and then they still live in this market."
"9271570","9274010"," So anyways, I'm going to take a quick break here. "
"9274550","9281550"," Um, I want you to know that if you are looking to extend this move down, you are going to"
"9281550","9283430"," be looking for, I'll put this on for you."
"9284350","9288190"," So if you're a bear right now, okay, I'm going to show you."
"9289010","9293690"," You want to see like a break of right here. "
"9297420","9299080"," You want to see a break right there."
"9302340","9304540"," If you see that break, you can pick the trade back up."
"9306360","9310140"," You want to see the you want to see like a convincing breakdown below here, and you'll start to"
"9310140","9311060"," move down into the close. "
"9311500","9316060"," If you don't see this breakdown here, right, you're going to look for a retracement higher to R1."
"9316580","9318740"," Well, you've got you've got the R2."
"9319760","9321720"," You've got the VWAP to be looking at. "
"9325540","9326780"," The VWAP is right here."
"9327060","9332140"," There's love taking trades just like bulls like taking trades off VWAP, right?"
"9332760","9335020"," If you see that, that would be a convincing trade for R3."
"9336520","9342680"," If not, you're going to be looking for much higher at R1 and the gap above that pivot up here. "
"9345200","9346800"," Do you think it makes sense for you if you're a bear?"
"9347040","9348060"," I can't believe I help bear."
"9348320","9352960"," I can't believe I always say, I always shit talk bears, and then we'll soon as we turn to a"
"9352960","9356260"," bear market, I'm like, okay, let's work with the bears now."
"9357300","9358820"," Now I got to work with the bears. "
"9359180","9362160"," Now I got to convince the bulls not to be taking longs."
"9363500","9366660"," And I got to switch on the bear suit for the bears."
"9373300","9374480"," Cap is low key bear. "
"9380540","9381160"," Thanks, John."
"9381320","9383900"," I appreciate that saying that I must pay attention to the overshoot move."
"9384100","9387620"," And I'm queuing nearing the bottom of the extreme low-redge, 20-day, one-hour LLC. "
"9388180","9390180"," Safety trade might dictate book need 50."
"9390660","9391240"," Thanks, John."
"9397780","9398200"," Sit. "
"9398400","9398940"," Keep your money."
"9400180","9401440"," Keep your money."
"9402600","9403440"," Very important. "
"9403960","9404660"," Wealth preservation."
"9407400","9409880"," You want this part of the trade right here, not that part."
"9410180","9415720"," That this part right here is where you get, that's where you find your top collars and your bottom"
"9415720","9416220"," collars. "
"9416840","9417460"," Get away from those people."
"9427820","9429340"," So you guys want some points of rejection?"
"9429620","9430380"," I'll put them on here too."
"9431400","9432580"," Uh, hold on here. "
"9432800","9433720"," I got to take a fucking break."
"9434000","9436900"," Drink coffee and water all morning blabbing."
"9437280","9439000"," I'm over here just blabbing. "
"9439260","9441180"," Here's another bright red one for you right there."
"9443280","9445580"," Uh, you know what our one is, right?"
"9445800","9446780"," So our one's bright red."
"9447240","9451900"," I mean, these are places right here that if you're a bear, you want to see some rejection. "
"9452460","9454560"," You might not see them, right?"
"9455040","9458040"," But these are some places of interest for you as a bear."
"9462600","9467300"," All right, you want to see like, you want to see VWAP come in here, you want to see, uh,"
"9468540","9471240"," you know, for the trade lower, you want to see this, right?"
"9472500","9477000"," If it doesn't happen and we trade up, you're looking to see this to take the trade down."
"9477140","9477460"," Makes sense. "
"9478280","9480240"," If they break above, same kind of a thing, right?"
"9480520","9481500"," It's the exact same kind of thing."
"9483200","9486760"," Um, you see, start seeing, squeezing up here, right?"
"9486760","9489760"," You want to see this rejection here and start taking this back down again?"
"9490180","9491820"," All that kind of stuff you're looking for."
"9498100","9499720"," Just don't get caught in this shit right here. "
"9499840","9501200"," Because this shit right here can get messy."
"9505200","9505560"," Dangerous."
"9521310","9522690"," Does that, I think that helps, right?"
"9525930","9527330"," There's in full control right now. "
"9537870","9541210"," I'll show it on a larger, uh, frame for what they're trying to do."
"9546260","9548860"," You can see it trying to grind through this whole area right here, right?"
"9551720","9553500"," Come down, smack it, test it once."
"9554560","9557000"," Come down, bash it, one, two, and three, right?"
"9557720","9558980"," You want to get this break right here. "
"9559100","9560340"," You can see it, the three strikes."
"9561520","9563820"," And trying to work their way through right now and break through."
"9564180","9568160"," So if they break through here, you want to then pick up those calls after the breakthrough. "
"9574700","9576500"," You want to see that break right there."
"9576580","9579460"," If you start seeing that break, you can jump in, but not until that break happens."
"9580580","9581440"," Get your finger on the trigger. "
"9584180","9585920"," So you can take that short lower."
"9596060","9601500"," I wish I could turn the screener upside down so that you can see it on, um, like a bullwood."
"9602140","9604260"," So a bull could see what I'm trying to talk about here. "
"9608540","9610520"," Trying to break support right here."
"9616580","9620460"," We guys watching this on both book map and, uh, book chart."
"9625340","9627620"," Should I get, uh, we should have wanted to take a break. "
"9627800","9629600"," I'm like, I can't, they might break through here."
"9632940","9633680"," They're trying."
"9638440","9640120"," They are fucking trying, man. "
"9640980","9642480"," They're trying their best right now."
"9645760","9648140"," Theirs are like, smash it through right now."
"9651660","9663720"," Yeah, I'm"
"9663720","9667440"," not, I wouldn't, I don't have no interest in this unless it starts to break through. "
"9667800","9671380"," Like, if there were interest in a short here, none."
"9672260","9674080"," I know what this shit is, a fucking trap."
"9674920","9675860"," It looks like a trap. "
"9676180","9680680"," If you flip this upside down and we were at like a top as a bull, I'd be like, get"
"9680680","9681720"," out of there right now."
"9681760","9682680"," They're going to roll it on you."
"9685720","9686600"," Don't be doing this. "
"9688520","9691720"," I should, I should flip the screen upside down so you can see what my point is."
"9701310","9702810"," Oh, I'll give you a level right here."
"9702990","9703810"," 386-12. "
"9705430","9707590"," I, you'll, you'll nail this to the tee."
"9708010","9709850"," If you break this, you'll nail this to a tee."
"9711110","9711890"," You'll tag it. "
"9712110","9712990"," You'll tag it into the bell."
"9713530","9714670"," I just don't see it today."
"9716410","9718210"," Then 3503 is your next one right down here. "
"9720870","9721810"," But that has to break."
"9722010","9722870"," That level is strong."
"9725670","9728970"," This is, that's the last, this is the last bull by. "
"9730570","9740880"," I mean, bulls are, bulls"
"9740880","9741880"," got nothing over here."
"9741900","9744860"," They got all kinds of places for the bears to step back in."
"9746120","9756020"," And they've got the point of control in the, in the, and they've got the, there's the big giant"
"9756020","9756960"," gap up here too. "
"9761650","9765430"," And that's the, I think that's the 38% retracement is the pivot."
"9767090","9768150"," You guys want to see it?"
"9769730","9771310"," Again, one more time before I take a break."
"9781820","9783340"," So anything below here is an extension. "
"9784040","9787000"," I think we'll, well, at least with the levels there, it's an extension."
"9790640","9796380"," Kind of matches up to see, kind of match it up over there."
"9797120","9799640"," You got 23%. "
"9799640","9801660"," 38% is right in here."
"9803360","9806680"," And then 61% up here."
"9808880","9810620"," It's 78%, 100% right here. "
"9812380","9813520"," So it's pretty close."
"9814320","9816740"," Anything over, anything below here is a gift."
"9817740","9827470"," So, you know, trades that are made, if you break through down here, it's all, all,"
"9827610","9829570"," all extra gravy for a bear. "
"9833250","9836370"," And if you want to trade the extension, you need to see the break."
"9837230","9839970"," You want to see, you want to see the break for the extension down here."
"9858610","9865710"," That's why I like, so like, not today, but it's like if we break down here today, I would like"
"9865710","9866970"," to buy that close probably. "
"9870580","9877160"," If we do this bullshit in here, like I wouldn't buy this close, like this close, I wouldn't buy to"
"9877160","9880600"," be really afraid of us coming back down on tomorrow to nail that."
"9881420","9883260"," I think this is my Friday target, right?"
"9883260","9887960"," I think I wrote this this morning 35 or 3850 on Friday close is what I'm looking for."
"9889820","9891440"," I'm not looking for it today. "
"9891860","9894140"," We could get it today, but I'm not looking for it today."
"9897060","9902940"," I'm starting to break below support right now."
"9904340","9905760"," This is not good for the bulls. "
"9908120","9909480"," Just grinding down here."
"9932440","9934800"," Yeah, of course it's going to get nastier chase."
"9934980","9935960"," We're changing trend, bro. "
"9937480","9942060"," We're more than likely from yesterday when I went back yesterday and watched J-POW."
"9942800","9950160"," And from what I'm perceiving is that we're definitely getting a retest of the weekly moving"
"9950160","9950440"," average."
"9951080","9958160"," I would put like a 90% chance of that happening in January, March. "
"9958660","9960500"," I think that's close, right?"
"9960500","9961620"," That's two weeks from now."
"9963140","9964740"," So you're talking about..."
"9967820","9968860"," Here, we'll look at it."
"9973200","9976540"," So, I mean, you're talking about what I'm expecting. "
"9981280","9982320"," Where's a..."
"9983920","9985440"," I'm expecting this by..."
"9987060","9994100"," I'm expecting like a test of 356 or whatever this is into January."
"9995260","9996120"," That's soon, man."
"9996260","9997000"," That's like two, three weeks. "
"9997260","9999340"," That's really, really fast."
"10000940","10001780"," And I'm expecting..."
"10001780","10003500"," I'm expecting as the slip under."
"10003540","10004300"," I'll be honest with you. "
"10006000","10008180"," I posted this about J-POW yesterday."
"10008360","10009040"," I'm expecting..."
"10012600","10013800"," We're going to test this."
"10014960","10017240"," And we're likely going to go under it. "
"10019720","10022880"," And at that point, there's nothing they can do."
"10024880","10030720"," And this could end up taking like two years of real damage."
"10031140","10032040"," Like, so you're going to see..."
"10032040","10033860"," You're more than likely going to see after what he did. "
"10033960","10034020"," Yes."
"10034600","10035740"," So I don't know what you guys..."
"10036260","10038360"," How much do you guys know about this stuff or not?"
"10038540","10041240"," I know there's everybody that sounds smart out there."
"10041980","10046240"," Seems like they know what they're talking about, but I don't think people understand the impact of"
"10047380","10048540"," what he did yesterday. "
"10050540","10052160"," And they are going to..."
"10053020","10055920"," They're going to create market destruction and economic destruction."
"10057280","10058240"," You'll probably see..."
"10059320","10062180"," If we break this now, we have to break this down here."
"10063240","10071620"," But if we do break this down here, more than likely going to see some real, real nasty shit. "
"10072520","10073500"," And so what he's doing is..."
"10074820","10080980"," Sony is looking to break ground on the factory as soon as 2024, bringing it online in fiscal 2025."
"10080980","10082460"," So it's going to break the oil here?"
"10082560","10083460"," Yes, according to Nick Eye."
"10083780","10085500"," We're starting to get the staircase down. "
"10086520","10087400"," It's good progress to the bears."
"10088740","10097200"," I don't see anything stopping us now going down at 386.12. But what he did yesterday"
"10097200","10098900"," was..."
"10101440","10103040"," What he did yesterday was..."
"10103040","10105180"," It was wild."
"10106140","10108420"," He's basically telling..."
"10108420","10111820"," Janet Yellen alluded to it on Sunday in 60 minutes. "
"10112900","10118480"," The host was asking her not pointed questions, but enough to say..."
"10120640","10122160"," It was a really weird conversation."
"10122500","10125880"," It was like, because they'd be in a room with two wealthy people and you just thought..."
"10125880","10128900"," That's not almost in regards to the factory as the planetary sector."
"10129440","10131140"," And they don't want you to understand what they're talking about. "
"10137440","10139100"," He's pretty much stating that."
"10139280","10139840"," They're going to..."
"10144260","10146740"," The course that they're on is not enough."
"10150060","10152440"," And what they're doing right now is not enough. "
"10153420","10161280"," And if they stand that course, it pins the market just long enough for us to slip under the weekly"
"10161280","10161940"," moving average."
"10163940","10166100"," And historically, once we've slipped under the moving average..."

"10181380","10182500"," demand destruction. "
"10182880","10185540"," You get real economic destruction."
"10187080","10188960"," Housing destruction, you'll get unemployment."
"10190040","10191660"," And all that stuff stems from the unemployment side. "
"10195100","10198760"," So they're not being honest with you, which is probably the wrong thing."
"10199000","10209000"," If you're out there right now, if he actually is sticking with the plan, you'll see by"
"10209000","10211860"," the end of 2023, some real bad shit out there."
"10214960","10220240"," You'll have like a friend or a cousin that says, my job's bulletproof, and that'll be the guy that"
"10220240","10220800"," gets fired. "
"10222440","10223300"," They need me."
"10226540","10228000"," Those are the ones that get fired."
"10240700","10241940"," We're going to chart it out. "
"10242300","10243540"," We'll look at that this week."
"10244120","10245500"," There's some real low targets."
"10246660","10252460"," Your first stop is going to probably be 32, 3100, but that won't be it. "
"10253560","10254680"," It'll go lower."
"10255440","10261320"," It'll likely, it'll like, there's a high percentage now of like 26%, or 2600."
"10262560","10268380"," There's another target that was, there was a target below in like 16 or 1400 that had like a 15 "
"10268380","10269140","% chance. "
"10270120","10272720"," And now it's like 30 or 40% chance."
"10272900","10273540"," I gotta run the numbers."
"10273760","10274300"," I haven't run the numbers. "
"10274800","10275780"," It's been two days."
"10276020","10282580"," So it's gonna take me like a week to run all this stuff and see how bad it can get."
"10289830","10291430"," Yeah, he didn't do enough too. "
"10291690","10292590"," That was another weird part."
"10293410","10299330"," I expected him to, my expectation was that he tried to run the market up a little bit and then"
"10299330","10301230"," crash it back down to like 3200."
"10302690","10307490"," But he's setting up now for a full market meltdown, which is kind of wild. "
"10307750","10308770"," I wasn't expecting that yesterday."
"10309650","10311930"," That whole soft landing thing is pretty much out the window."
"10313610","10315670"," I don't believe it at all anymore. "
"10316150","10319990"," I gave it until what he said yesterday, and I was like, oh no."
"10320670","10325330"," Either they don't know what they're talking about or they're in like the cult of economics and not"
"10325330","10327950"," in the actual economics of what needs to happen for."
"10329970","10333030"," Because they can crash the market wherever they want, right?"
"10333170","10334110"," They can crash it on a high. "
"10334450","10341910"," They can crash it on a low and that's why people are saying, people are saying people today are"
"10341910","10347410"," saying that that was the last Fed rate increase you'll ever see."
"10348030","10348430"," That's it."
"10348590","10349250"," That's the last one. "
"10350470","10355850"," Because it's being boxed into that corner of you're going to crash the market to very, very nasty"
"10355850","10356410"," shit."
"10361130","10367990"," But from what I took away from it yesterday was if he stays, if he's not lying, that's the only"
"10367990","10369670"," counter argument that he's got that he's not lying."
"10370330","10374730"," So I guess if I'm wrong, then he does stay the course. "
"10375530","10385530"," You'll see us flip under the weekly moving average and historically that does not go well and"
"10385530","10387550"," we'll know that we'll confirm it when it happens."
"10388390","10392230"," So if we trade down to the weekly moving average, we slip underneath it from that point forward,"
"10392750","10393870"," that's a whole nother trade."
"10394210","10401790"," That's like a whole nother like so that so like the top of the S&P 500 in January 7th,"
"10402690","10406810"," if we slip under the weekly moving average, you're going to get another whole nother trade. "
"10406810","10412130"," That's just like January 7th that'll last like one to three years."
"10412750","10414590"," It'll be crazy sauce."
"10420150","10421950"," Did Larry Williams come on with a video?"
"10432670","10438930"," So yeah, there's some there's some like crazy like implications to what he's saying. "
"10440170","10443630"," The bizarre part is I mean, not the bizarre part."
"10443730","10447590"," I thought he would I thought he would do is trigger the market to go up."
"10448710","10455390"," Maybe we hit like 430 or attempt to and then slam it down from 430 down to like 3200 or"
"10455390","10455590"," something. "
"10459880","10463380"," But it does it looks like he doesn't want to save the market and he doesn't want to save the"
"10463380","10465840"," economy once both to burn, which is fine."
"10467320","10469520"," It's probably some banks that are in this too."
"10470260","10474800"," They want to see the see a quenching on the market too, which I can't blame either. "
"10476460","10480360"," It's always nice to buy stocks at a really low price like start over again."
"10482020","10485980"," I think that even bulls to some extent want to see that destruction."
"10486700","10491220"," I just don't think they don't I don't think that they see where how low it will will go with"
"10491220","10500260"," depending upon what he just said was pretty much a confirmation that"
"10500260","10505880"," well unless unless he's lying right we're right back that this is last rate increase. "
"10507120","10508680"," But I'm doubting it right now."
"10510460","10514860"," I think I think he's chosen the the death markets trade, which is good."
"10515880","10518120"," I will trade that market all the way down to the depths of hell. "
"10519180","10520700"," And then we'll we'll buy it all together."
"10520700","10521900"," You know we'll do that."
"10535700","10539960"," Did he just put that out that Larry Williams just put a I like Larry Williams the guy that I"
"10539960","10540420"," like a lot. "
"10545070","10548970"," He's the reason I like him a lot is because he winky turned me on to him."
"10549070","10555230"," But what I really like about him is that I like people you know like you're a young guy and"
"10555230","10556090"," you like old guys."
"10557410","10560810"," Generally speaking in most of my life they haven't liked older guys. "
"10561910","10563370"," Like I fucked those old guys."
"10563730","10569610"," The only time placed in my life where I really appreciate older guys advice is in the stock market."
"10570530","10572330"," It's all time and market for those guys. "
"10573650","10578130"," They've seen everything right so they've seen all the lies they've seen all the doom and gloom"
"10578130","10582290"," they've seen all the bullishness out there on tops."
"10582990","10590050"," So the longer the older the guy is you can usually get the truth the closest truth of what's really"
"10590050","10590690"," going to happen."
"10592550","10596510"," You like you want to meet like portfolio managers have lost everything and gained everything you"
"10596510","10599710"," want to meet like market makers that have lost everything gained everything you want to meet. "
"10600310","10606450"," Pit traders that have lost and gained everything or have seen the market go to crazy places so you"
"10606450","10608790"," can you can see what what they're saying is going to happen."
"10609910","10611110"," Their experience is important."
"10619600","10625340"," Our cash in I feel like they I feel like they will hit them out only to give excuses as"
"10625340","10626900"," to why the market is going where it's going. "
"10627440","10628620"," I don't trust our cash in at all."
"10630120","10630660"," At all."
"10631060","10631880"," You got no love for that guy. "
"10632940","10633760"," People love him."
"10633900","10635260"," I despise him."
"10635400","10639600"," The US 30 year fixed rate more which is a 6.3. 1% of it is a paid show"
"10639600","10643540"," versus the 6.3. That's the GMC and GME gang say. "
"10645540","10647040"," Well he has I agree with that."
"10647040","10650720"," It's going to be pretty many of those little guys like doing your fixed rate more give average five"
"10650720","10652980"," spot five four percent as of December 15th."
"10652980","10658440"," Like who's the other one that I can't stand is Carl Eichen taking your bag of dicks too. "
"10663410","10664310"," That's a fair point."
"10664370","10665370"," You're making a fair point Ryan."
"10668770","10670830"," I know that AMC and GME are different. "
"10671070","10672170"," I agree with that statement too."
"10672790","10674890"," A little bit of squeeziness going on up here."
"10676210","10677510"," Let's try to trap some bears. "
"10678710","10679910"," Trap them and gap them."
"10682890","10684590"," The art of cash in there like that."
"10685810","10687110"," I'm going to take a quick break here. "

"10720340","10721440"," Tesla's showing you the way."
"10722160","10726720"," Tesla's bounced right off the 200 on the one minute and it looks like it's going to try to squeeze"
"10726720","10730340"," itself higher here maybe for a trade trade above and beyond the pivot."

"12509900","12510180"," here."
"12510320","12511660"," But I don't think I want to see it today. "
"12511800","12515880"," I want to see it in the close on the options markets kind of where you need more puts to"
"12515880","12517800"," come into the options market to get down here."
"12517860","12523980"," So I was like, if we don't see those puts into the market for tomorrow or by tomorrow, we might"
"12523980","12526940"," not see this this tag until Friday at the bell."
"12527880","12531440"," So I don't know you're not going to be able to time it for when we get down there, but"
"12532460","12533660"," that's the target for sure. "
"12534260","12544130"," I guess the real question is, you know, when do the shorts come off when they"
"12544130","12545490"," come back in for this trade down?"
"12546250","12556080"," The other thing you're going to be looking at here is society general raises forecast"
"12556080","12556500"," for this."
"12556540","12560400"," Have you just been here somewhere from 3% previously?"
"12568500","12569440"," It's just a matter of it."
"12569640","12570540"," Does it get to the VWOP?"

"12625050","12629090"," And this area right here is pretty much that upper range on."
"12630530","12632250"," That's this area right up in here."
"12636420","12636980"," Roughly. "
"12648480","12649920"," Let's see you guys are saying here."
"12653440","12654820"," Hey, Papasha, you out there?"

"12684640","12685900"," Looking for moving end of day."
"12686060","12688500"," If you can get below big money loading long call options."
"12689240","12690980"," Massive bear trap in central rally coming. "
"12691180","12691820"," I haven't seen that."
"12692600","12697460"," If you've seen that, I don't know, post me and tag me in Twitter or something."
"12703440","12704940"," You went full bully yesterday. "
"12705380","12707980"," Yeah, I didn't I thought I could I took one trade yesterday."
"12709320","12717620"," For I think I was in it for 15 or 20 minutes and we moved up, but there was so"
"12717620","12721580"," much there was so much premium."
"12721780","12726100"," Normally in those events you'll come into and one side will be a lot. "
"12726200","12726840"," It'll be lopsided."
"12727240","12734900"," You'll see like I don't know like a 30 delta put for like fucking three dollars and 30 delta call"
"12734900","12739880"," for like 30 cents or you'll see like a three dollar call and like a 30 cent put."
"12740700","12745860"," So you can kind of take the other side of that trade fairly well, or at least by both sides"
"12745860","12748660"," and not worry too much about making up either side. "
"12749900","12751480"," So we walked in the door yesterday."
"12755340","12760980"," And we walked in the door yesterday and I'm like, well, there's no fucking point in buying either"
"12760980","12761680"," side of this shit."
"12762000","12769720"," And then the weird part was I was on screen yesterday and this trade right here was baller. "
"12770460","12772180"," Like this trade from here to here."
"12774620","12781780"," Like that trade right there and ended up I think these calls were a dollar 30 and they wound up"
"12781780","12783940"," at like three dollars and 85 cents or something."
"12784020","12786120"," There's like a 300 cent trade right here. "
"12787040","12788500"," Still a rich trade to get in."
"12788840","12790360"," Not that bad though it is dollar 30."
"12791140","12794160"," I think these calls at one point were like three bucks up here or something too. "
"12797200","12802160"," So it did it did like timing mattered and then waiting for after the event mattered."
"12802160","12808940"," But even generally speaking like the price of calls and puts over here was insane or like over"
"12808940","12813400"," there yesterday the price of calls and puts yesterday was it wasn't worth playing."
"12813680","12818260"," I mean I think I bought a 10 pack of calls the first time that morning and it cost me"
"12818260","12818940"," like three grand. "
"12818940","12823540"," And I think I think they went up like 60 bucks or something."
"12823560","12824300"," It was stupid."
"12825520","12832120"," I don't like trading I don't like trading zero dates when they're very expensive. "
"12832120","12838820"," I like trading zero zero date trades to be cheap not expensive."
"12839640","12841400"," I don't care what it puts their calls."
"12842140","12846860"," If they're like close to in the money and they're dirt cheap it's a pretty easy way to just be"
"12846860","12853920"," like probably going to reverse here or like everybody's in a trade and it's overpriced. "
"12857420","12863840"," So like in here two things should happen you should either see puts get ground to dust to get"
"12863840","12867380"," another roll another round of put buyers to come down here."
"12868140","12872900"," But you're never going to see like in the money shit just keep going unless you get new buyers."
"12875380","12879360"," You know so this is either going to be a nice grind operation here where they just grind them down"
"12879360","12885900"," then they send us down here and you don't get paid for being positioned here for a move lower or"
"12885900","12888420"," you'll see it squeezed up if they can't get the grind down. "
"12893800","12902640"," So it's all about you know like taking the money from you right it's not about you taking the money"
"12902640","12908220"," because you picked it right other direction right it's like a lot of it has to do with when you"
"12908220","12909560"," took them either side."
"12910880","12911540"," What are you saying?"
"12911640","12913240"," This OPEX is going to be a massive next week."
"12916680","12919760"," All I'm seeing what you guys are saying in the chat here big money loading up. "
"12920020","12924160"," All my puts are drilling up nicely man I fucked up when full bull yesterday with that one."
"12926060","12928660"," Hold on my chat is kind of wonky right now."
"12929380","12930240"," It like jumps. "
"12932440","12935840"," I think one more move down tomorrow yesterday next week at the Christmas."
"12936160","12939480"," It's off post Christmas from OPEX it's going to be a massive next week."
"12939780","12941060"," Yeah it's a pretty big one it's not huge. "
"12941980","12944380"," It's not the largest we've had but it's large."
"12946580","12947420"," Premium of guard."
"12948340","12952180"," I've eaten today and tomorrow quite high but still low for next week around 20ish. "
"12952680","12954500"," Yeah Chase that's what I was looking for man."
"12954680","12956600"," I wanted to check the implied vol."
"12956600","12961580"," I've got the old so I've got the I still have the I think I still have the old snapshot"
"12961580","12968540"," of the old ball on OPEX and I want to compare it to the tail end and see if it's"
"12968540","12969300"," increased or not. "
"12971260","12979140"," And I didn't get a chance to download the CBO data this morning so I'm going to go ask my"
"12979140","12981220"," wife and say honestly I'll ask her right now."
"12981800","12982220"," Sweet."
"12993030","12993550"," Sweet. "
"12994950","12999930"," I agree with 385 spot cap to leg in the calls for a retrace up."
"13000210","13001970"," Spy goes x-div tomorrow."
"13002790","13005550"," Once I've guaranteed down move there is everyone. "
"13005990","13007230"," Yeah I agree Matt Mao."
"13008010","13010050"," I think we get the 385 bike by close tomorrow."
"13013490","13016370"," Taking cheap spy call for this bounce here. "
"13016590","13017550"," Sellers and hero positives."
"13017930","13018690"," I mean anything to make up."
"13019250","13024950"," Now here indicators are a weird thing like I think Chase can attest to this or maybe Chase knows"
"13024950","13025630"," more than I do. "
"13025810","13034730"," When I had the hero indicator for a year or two and it sometimes lagged on both ends."
"13035550","13038850"," So like if they were selling you know sometimes it didn't but sometimes it did."
"13039550","13046230"," So you'd see like you'd see the market start selling calls and buying puts right are selling puts"
"13046230","13046930"," and buying calls. "
"13047610","13049090"," This usually looks like that."
"13050350","13056430"," So right now they're horse trading right now as well I like to say it but selling puts for profit"
"13056430","13060330"," and buying calls for long but it could take time for it to show in the market."
"13060950","13067230"," Now in that process if they don't spy calls right and they rebuy puts down here you'll see the"
"13067230","13068150"," market continue down. "
"13068950","13072890"," I never like to see this kind of a move down and not see the finish into the close."
"13073530","13079170"," Either I always like to see that last capitulation move and you when you're not seeing that here"
"13079170","13085690"," you're not seeing like you want to see like that last capitulation move."
"13085690","13091290"," So I'm hesitant to take along with conviction other than a retrace of some kind. "
"13095550","13102990"," Personally I don't so but if it starts moving up this could easily you can see it on book map"
"13102990","13104830"," that we could easily move this up a little bit."
"13105910","13110690"," But if they try to close this out strong in our three into the close today maybe a better position."
"13114610","13116950"," Burned all your options real shorts hold on. "
"13119290","13124850"," Just real shorts I think come in at 394 that dumped the top after and yesterday was the time that"
"13124850","13125690"," we were going down today."
"13125950","13132730"," Quick 100% missed calls thank you guys to my and thank you guys minus 81 or Dow."
"13133250","13135130"," There's a circuit breaker but I don't think so. "
"13136770","13142030"," You know what I'm looking for on NQ is I really really want to see the break of 10,000."
"13142990","13148950"," It's like that like that whole area there is earlier in the video this morning I showed NQ and"
"13148950","13154890"," where you're looking for real structural damage in tech you want to see it."
"13155450","13164180"," It's right around that 10,000 area and I got up and down a couple hundred points but if you"
"13164180","13171620"," want to see that big huge next trade on NQ it's below 10,000 it's like 6500 it's a giant"
"13171620","13171960"," move. "
"13174460","13176060"," Those are running for the life right now."
"13176800","13178840"," I think it's just a slow squeeze up."
"13180240","13189960"," There's an argument about I saw someone say something about you get the swing high"
"13189960","13193780"," on to the swing high and swing low down here. "
"13193780","13200320"," You got the new low down below so we could trade higher but I'm telling you what when we broke"
"13200320","13205040"," you saw this this morning when as soon as you break this down here you got the new low bears"
"13205040","13210060"," got new low you're going to see a trend change here you'll start to see moving averages roll over"
"13210060","13215400"," here no matter how you're seeing them right now so you'll see these moving averages roll over right"
"13215400","13219860"," now right starts this is a 15 minute chart you'll see eventually in the one minute one hour chart"
"13221100","13226920"," and you know it's funny I was on Twitter a moment ago right and I'm watching bears watching bears"
"13226920","13232780"," and I'm like this shit took like a month and a half like a month in a fucking half so"
"13232780","13239280"," you give them their day and stuff but you really do you know if you're a bear you need this"
"13239280","13244520"," is what the bear bears want and bears need and when they get this today you're attacking a month of"
"13244520","13250220"," a fucking half to wait for this shit there's a long fucking time you know bears are fucking calling"
"13250220","13259280"," for death for you know October 13th and so this is this is the part of that a rational trade"
"13259280","13264580"," when you see this how this move happened today this is a one hour chart you're going to start to"
"13264580","13268500"," see these you're going to start to see these moving averages curl over man you're going to start to"
"13268500","13276000"," see a trend reversal here heading down so I don't know what the elf rally at this point this this"
"13276000","13283580"," is pretty convincing technically it's very convincing but there's not going to be an elf rally so I"
"13283580","13291500"," wouldn't I wouldn't you get a retrace here but I don't know I'm on the side of the bears right"
"13291500","13297920"," now 100 percent and the weird part about this is you couldn't be on the side of bears until today"
"13297920","13303340"," like every time every time it came down right they didn't do this and this is the first time"
"13303340","13308840"," they've done it so you got to give it to the bears and I realized that the heroine indicator might"
"13308840","13315180"," be telling you it's going up but for what though like some kind of small retrace or something like"
"13315180","13325060"," that I don't know let's see big money loading long all my puts are just drilling up nicely and I"
"13325060","13330920"," fucked up I want to get back to through you guys and just buy call abouts here sellers lost my"
"13330920","13335840"," shirt yesterday oh no movement burned all my options yep that shit that shit was just ripe for"
"13335840","13342900"," stealing people's money wasn't it uh bull's running for the life right now captain as you like to"
"13342900","13348280"," say we're grinding up cap or you're gonna see bottom cap are you going to tell the bottom soon"
"13348280","13353200"," right uh yeah if you're just tuning in right now you just go back to the beginning of the video"
"13354620","13359260"," um seeing from task news is Russian deputy I laid it all out for you since we're interested in"
"13359260","13364220"," increasing oil output as part of projects uh in Venezuela dynamic hedging on the indexes here would"
"13364220","13371800"," work well for equities um it does it's the implication of here indicator is that this stream is"
"13371800","13376940"," sponsored by ticks right it's trying to find you to actually hear the selling of flame futures if"
"13376940","13383020"," we're going up trying to tie in the selling of frogs that ticks right calls and then we're going"
"13383020","13389800"," down monetizing puts and seeing calls structure coming to the market uh not like selling puts then"
"13389800","13398400"," rebying puts it's like just reversals in market positioning who was getting straight pummeled by a"
"13398400","13405240"," state to look into it for us recommending one second here just missing a missing a bunch of shit"

"13429540","13434700"," seat fint it for a quick ring buying shares of spx repellent yeah put a rally again oh no shit"
"13434700","13440680"," huh next week we can be very bloody that's very true so chase knows what he's talking about you"
"13440680","13446560"," guys we have a lot of fucking options tied into this fucking expiry and if you guys want to see"
"13446560","13456540"," like fucking big red bars down you they gotta like get rid of this expiry you still 50k right on"
"13456540","13461700"," there aren't a lot of shorts there's no squeeze there's no rally but three not about three hundred"
"13461700","13468460"," was support what did the guys say about Venezuela uh so third so 390 is a place so right in"
"13468460","13472780"," here we are uh you want to see the break of the previous law i'm not going to go over"
"13472780","13477060"," this because i spent like an hour on it you want to see the break of a new low this"
"13477060","13483000"," is the first new low that we've had going all the way back to i think november 11th or 17th"
"13483000","13487540"," i'm not going back in the video for this shit but they got the pair's got the new low here"
"13487540","13494600"," but the one problem here is the the way the the options market is right now right the only way"
"13494600","13503000"," we go lower here right we get stretched down to 385 or something like an extension that's it right"
"13503000","13509060"," squeeze down that's it the only way you get down here is if you have real money selling or a"
"13509060","13513640"," new put structure coming to the market like heavy and hard so what you need to do is you need"
"13513640","13523500"," to have because you've got eight percent nine percent of the spx um uh or the the money flow"
"13523500","13529020"," in spx right eight percent of his options flow so you need like new people to come in so if"
"13529020","13535480"," i own a put and there's a dollar and i expected to go to ten dollars this is called bag"
"13535480","13540540"," holding right it's bag selling so it goes up to eight dollars i want to hand it off to somebody"
"13540540","13546040"," and tell them there's another two dollars in there so that second person to come get that bag for"
"13546040","13551020"," me if nobody's willing to buy that bag the dealers aren't going to buy it the dealers would be"
"13551020","13555080"," broke they'd go bankrupt right so they're going to make the price lower and lower until they can"
"13555080","13560200"," find somebody to buy it from you does it make sense now if there's more more more buyers coming in"
"13560200","13569760"," the options market can move the spx or spy complex down i hope that makes sense and so if that"
"13569760","13576260"," doesn't happen you have ranges right when they talk about car walls and foot walls they're telling"

"20959830","20968790"," signal for for the vix to start to rise so i don't know like"
"20968790","20981050"," i don't think everybody understands the vix but that's okay i don't have to win the vix fight like"
"20981050","20993260"," i'd want to see i'd want to see like"
"20993260","20998580"," you want to see the vix blast off it really needs to break under this level here you really need"
"20998580","21004420"," to break this uh and you can see the reason for this is because this is when we coming up"
"21004420","21014160"," here right and we we broke trend here you saw vix get really violent right and you saw vix get"
"21014160","21022920"," violent here now the vix stopped getting violent from this time period to anywhere in here no real"
"21022920","21030580"," high vix in here um there was some high vix down here uh and so you would want to see"

"21071520","21075540"," again i don't think you see it and i think if you do see it you're gonna be able to"
"21075540","21080620"," catch the ride down so why not why not just wait to buy the vix why not have some confirmation"
"21080620","21086480"," to buy the vix i don't know i don't know the logic behind buying the vix for a hundred right"
"21086480","21097010"," now i don't i don't see why you would do that right now uh"
