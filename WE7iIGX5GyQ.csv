"190","8030"," I'm going to almost there, almost there, that's some more coffee."
"11360","13060"," We got more down to go, by the way."
"13620","14860"," They didn't actually close that gap. "
"15040","16320"," There's a tiny bit of gap left there."
"22410","24170"," How the turn tables turn."
"49320","51040"," Check one, two. "
"53160","54320"," Yeah, let's do it."
"60140","61280"," Yeah, we're going to get underneath."
"61500","64319"," That gap is still not closed, by the way, it's still there. "
"64920","66160"," I know it can see it right there."
"67620","69940"," Hey, good morning, everybody."
"70080","70840"," How are you all doing out there?"
"72720","75480"," It's a big day, so we're going to leave everybody chat today. "
"82660","83820"," And what do we got here?"
"87430","87950"," Excuse me."
"88430","89890"," Hey, how are you all doing out there?"
"91210","94290"," We are likely not done going down if you're wondering."
"95170","98230"," Well, just as the heads up, there's a little bit of SPX. "
"99370","101070"," Well, I'll check it, but..."
"101070","103930"," I think tight here."
"105070","105950"," Let's see."
"106670","108510"," I've got a few things to get right into it. "
"109750","110190"," Alright."
"111350","112370"," I've got three."
"113390","114470"," Let's go out my..."
"114470","115090"," hold on a second here. "
"118910","122150"," I wonder if someone was messing with my camera or something."
"122650","124370"," I don't know what's going on with the camera over here."
"127169","129389"," Maybe the cat or something was messing with me. "
"129690","130690"," I don't know exactly."
"130810","132250"," Let me get closer to the in frame."
"133650","134530"," Okay, so..."
"136310","138950"," Let's have a look-see at a few things here for you. "
"140690","143290"," So we've got a gap down here, right, on spoos."
"145070","148470"," We'll talk about how we got a whole bunch of stuff to go over this one, but just for situational"
"148470","149830"," awareness for where we are."
"150810","153330"," Now, this should have closed this gap right here. "
"153870","155870"," And it has not yet."
"156050","157490"," I thought it did, but it didn't."
"159850","161390"," It's not done yet. "
"161590","165910"," If you look on the bottom screen down here, this is SPX down here."
"167070","169330"," And the gap is still there."
"169630","173970"," So just the heads up that the algos are tricky today. "
"174250","176270"," They are doing their thing."
"176530","178870"," Here, hold on."
"178950","179810"," Give me one quick second here. "
"181270","182670"," I've got to do a couple quick things."
"182670","188370"," I've got to make sure that the Russian hooker bots stay out of here and stuff."
"188630","194110"," The fake women trying to take all your money and stuff. "
"194450","195170"," Hold on here."
"197670","198190"," Customization."
"198610","202570"," Just the heads up that if you subscribe, it's free. "
"202870","204030"," Just click the button on YouTube."
"205370","208530"," You will be able to comment today because it's kind of a big day."
"209690","211930"," So we're going in to close that gap right now. "
"212030","216910"," I'm going to switch over to the Webull chart really quick."
"217110","220490"," And I want you to see, I want to draw your attention right here, okay?"
"222810","225410"," And if you're in puts, right?"
"226350","228930"," You want to close them once this gap is closed."
"229570","231630"," They're likely going to squeeze it one more time. "
"231870","236410"," So just the heads up that once this gap gets close, once you push through right here."
"237570","238630"," Target though is lower."
"238830","240810"," It's where PT2 is above. "
"241930","243230"," Tank tighter for a second."
"243650","244390"," I want you to see that gap."
"244730","247210"," They closed a little bit more if it's still not closed yet. "
"247930","250230"," A little tiny bit more to close of a gap there."
"252070","253370"," You can see it down below."
"253730","255390"," So they're trying to close this gap right now. "
"256370","257610"," You should see a squeeze."
"257990","259170"," I'd be not afraid."
"259630","265250"," But the other thing too is S1, if you look in the middle screen right here, S1 is 4."
"265250","273890"," 53.10. So that wouldn't shock me either to see one more down move up here. "
"274170","278390"," Just pull on one more down move right here."
"278670","278810"," Whoop."
"279050","282170"," And then straight down slam into that S1. "
"284620","286860"," So I took the money on this last red bar."
"286960","288300"," So I'm flat right now personally."
"288480","289720"," If you want to know if it's like long puts. "
"291580","295860"," I took the money on this on this bar down right here."
"296120","296460"," Let me go over to."
"300290","302610"," Let me go over and do something really quick. "
"303630","307710"," I'm going to make sure that Twitch people can chat."
"310290","311810"," Okay, so Twitch people can chat."
"311970","314590"," Everybody can chat on YouTube and Twitch this morning. "
"317960","318600"," Excuse me."
"320720","323260"," Taking out that gap right now on SPX."
"323460","324080"," It's still there. "
"324340","324960"," It hasn't gone."
"325120","326860"," There's a tiny bit of gap left down here."
"326920","327800"," Let's look at it right now. "
"327900","328800"," Just keep our eyes on it."
"331520","333440"," Let's see if they can grind this last part out."
"333440","335240"," Now this is S1. "
"335340","336680"," Did I write S1 in there this morning?"
"336820","336940"," No."
"339500","341020"," This is S1 right here."
"345140","346060"," So you can see it. "
"346260","348120"," I don't think we're done here at S1."
"348220","350620"," I think we got out and slam into this PT2."
"352400","354980"," So I think you're going to catch that PT2 and then. "
"355200","357900"," And then we should be done for the day."
"358000","361680"," There's actually a fair chance that we're going to go down there and spike."
"362520","364300"," We're actually going to see it on book map right here. "
"364380","366880"," So let me bring book map up so you can see it."
"366880","369320"," Don't necessarily trust book map here."
"369380","373940"," Book map can have hidden levels down below. "
"374260","375480"," It's just bright red right here."
"375620","377460"," They'll just staircase you down and stuff like that."
"377540","378660"," Just be careful of that as well. "
"383610","387270"," Those 43's are paying fucking 38 cents."
"389270","390550"," I should have stayed at them."
"391370","394530"," I think that right here. "
"394550","395450"," Give me one quick second here."
"397010","397490"," Yes."
"397490","398210"," There's S1. "
"398450","399370"," This here is the gap."
"401400","402840"," This is the gap right there."
"403920","405800"," And SPX has closed the gap. "
"406000","406640"," Be careful here."
"407080","410920"," It's either going to blast straight down or it's going to start squeezing hard and heavy."
"411220","412520"," So be really careful here. "
"414420","417000"," Here's you want to see a diagram right here that I've been trading."
"417040","417680"," It's right here."
"418980","420720"," So you can see that over there. "
"421680","424660"," The target is down below here at PT2."
"426260","429120"," Even if it's only showing a red bar, an art red bar."
"429500","431820"," Even if book map showing that, that's my target. "
"432300","433760"," That's where the gamma bar is."
"433880","440200"," So that yellow bar down below is four, five, three, four, five, two, five."
"440200","440820"," Excuse me. "
"441580","444980"," As a matter of fact, this one needs to go a little bit lower."
"445180","446840"," It needs to go right here."
"448000","450640"," There's still a lot of room to run to the downside here. "
"450640","453260"," A whole bunch of room to go."
"453560","455600"," This gamma bar right here, this is the 455."
"457460","458580"," So we're heading down here. "
"458900","460920"," We should get back down here at some point."
"461520","465180"," Just be careful of, let me say draw that in for you and just say gamma."
"465860","469600"," So you don't think that that is the save. "
"473540","475260"," I thought I had that written in here."
"475460","476000"," Oh yeah, right there."
"478200","480120"," So just so you can see it on SPX. "
"480120","485640"," So if you look in the bottom of your screen down there, you should see this is SPX."
"485960","487540"," And then on the right here, this is Spy."
"488380","491540"," On the right over here, I'm just monitoring Tesla this morning. "
"492360","493160"," Maybe one more second."
"493320","502850"," I got to post up some, I got to post up a live stream on Twitter."
"503850","504970"," There's always something to do. "
"512809","513289"," Spy."
"514070","515770"," And I think that's all we're doing today."
"518809","523980"," And okay. "
"550000","551880"," And Tesla Cyber Truck launch."
"567160","567920"," You want a quick second here?"
"572040","572560"," YouTube."
"579990","582350"," But I should have streamed this on Twitter. "
"582610","583410"," I haven't done that yet."
"584350","587990"," I got to put Twitter on the streaming."
"590510","597270"," So that I realized some people are going to want to watch this stuff on Twitter to support Zitter,"
"597530","598330"," X, whatever. "
"602760","604880"," Okay, there we go."
"608240","609000"," Excuse me."
"611780","612620"," All right. "
"614460","615580"," There is no Twitter."
"615580","622980"," Yeah, I know some of you fanboys like, to me, I think Twitter is a travesty that you've given up"
"622980","627220"," that name that he's given up that name or is killing that name for now."
"627340","631540"," That name is worth a lot, a lot of hard years, work, money, that kind of stuff. "
"632360","636440"," I'm not particularly, particularly a fan."
"636580","640160"," You're talking about an like Lexicon surrounding it."
"644000","647200"," I'm not a fan of changing the name to X."
"647900","649600"," Now, you can do it every once. "
"649600","650160"," He owns it."
"650220","651040"," It's not a public company."
"651600","653500"," But personally, I like that. "
"653580","657980"," I think my thought on Twitter was my thought on Twitter."
"658520","660940"," Like, I understand that he wants to do the everything company."
"661220","662900"," I like the everything company. "
"663120","664260"," I've brought that up years ago."
"665220","666740"," The X everything company."
"667020","668920"," But as an umbrella, I like it more. "
"669640","672120"," And then Twitter would be a sub or a part of that."
"672660","674580"," But I get that the names don't really work."
"674580","677880"," I understand the concept of it, but I understand why he's doing it. "
"682440","684340"," Yeah, it'll always be Twitter to me."
"685600","689240"," I'll never, I don't think I'll ever change what I call it."
"689500","691260"," I can understand people wanting to support it. "
"691360","692800"," Don't call it X and stuff like that."
"692800","693260"," I get it."
"693500","693840"," I understand. "
"694760","696440"," But, you know, this is like ingrained."
"696940","698100"," It'll always be Twitter."
"698340","699640"," And you know, companies do that, right?"
"701180","704940"," When I was young, there were companies where my father would call some. "
"704940","706200"," As a matter of fact, I got a good example."
"706520","712000"," The Boston Herald used to be the record way back in the day."
"712180","715720"," So when I was a kid, my dad would say to me, can you go down and grab me a"
"715720","716000"," record?"
"716280","718760"," So I'd got to run down to the store and grab a record for my dad. "
"718900","721520"," And that was actually the Herald newspaper."
"722920","724280"," When I was a kid, that's what it was named."
"724580","727480"," But my dad was like, it'll always be the record to me. "
"727680","731520"," And as a matter of fact, we used that to find out if you were from Boston or not."
"731520","737980"," If someone ever called that newspaper, the Herald, we'd be like, that person's not from Boston."
"738740","744280"," Because only you'd only know that if you were from Boston once the Herald name was used. "
"744780","747260"," So personally, for me, that's what it is."
"747400","749060"," But I understand why you're doing it or people do it."
"751260","751960"," All right. "
"752300","754680"," So welcome back, everybody."
"754680","760240"," If you're just joining us, have the chat open on both Twitch and YouTube this morning."
"760940","763740"," So you're able to just chat freely all day long. "
"763740","766620"," Please be civil throughout the show."
"767020","770980"," If you are a Tesla gang or Tesla bull."
"771760","778800"," And if you are a Tesla Q or Tesla seller, please try to be friendly. "
"779220","784020"," Even if you poke fun at each other today, I'm going to ask you that right out the gate."
"784040","788420"," If you are not civil, you'll be like perma band forever."
"788420","793960"," So please just know you can poke fun at each other nicely and keep it light. "
"794760","799640"," I know that's a very volatile Elon Musk is a very volatile topic right now."
"801120","804940"," If you want to know what my stance is on Elon, I am a Tesla bull."
"805860","809440"," But I am not an Elon simp. "
"809620","811560"," I guess that's what they like to call them these days at all."
"812740","813740"," And I'll talk to you about that."
"813880","817100"," If you guys ever want to care about that or why and all the things and the reasoning. "
"818480","819180"," For that."
"821680","822520"," I still."
"823040","824460"," Well, we'll talk about that. "
"824460","825960"," Let's talk about Elon for a minute, I guess."
"826540","827840"," Because we're still heading down here."
"827920","829160"," We should still blast down here. "
"829500","830460"," So we squeeze back up."
"830480","832080"," That's this little bump right here."
"832280","835000"," And we should start heading down and at least tag this S1 next. "
"838320","842580"," Now, just so you know from my side, I've been a Tesla bull for a very long time."
"842900","847920"," I don't really drink the Kool-Aid on Tesla Q or Tesla bulls."
"847920","849960"," I look back towards. "
"850320","855460"," I've made this comment for years now that Elon to me is like a Howard Hughes."
"858420","861500"," And I like him because I was in the military."
"862180","865740"," Howard Hughes helped our country and our military out by being an outsider. "
"867460","868580"," For progress."
"869120","872820"," What happens in our society in the U.S. specifically."
"873690","877940"," Is we have a lot of companies that do not innovate. "
"878740","883500"," And the military industrial complexes like that too."
"883580","889940"," I was in the army and I do not like using outdated or dog shit equipment."
"890860","893900"," And their needs to always be an outsider. "
"894900","901300"," That's allowed to push mainstream companies to innovate."
"901300","907080"," As a matter of fact, I saw a post this morning from what's his face, the guy from Detroit, actually"
"907080","908200"," him and his dad are from Detroit."
"908900","914360"," And he said I have to give it to Elon for pushing all these other companies as a Tesla Q"
"914360","914660"," guy. "
"915300","922060"," Pushing Elon to or Elon's pushing regular auto companies forcing them to look towards EV as a"
"922060","922400"," solution."
"922800","927340"," And I got to tell you like I appreciate that, right?"
"928160","937260"," If you're an Elon bull and a Tesla bull or even Tesla Q, it doesn't really matter."
"938380","941400"," You're not going to get changed in a lot of industries unless you're bringing an outsider. "
"941940","946220"," And oftentimes those outsiders come with baggage and problems and public problems."
"947320","951680"," And personal problem or issues or mental health things and stuff like that."
"952240","959040"," So from my view, at least from my viewpoint, I can put up with that as long as these companies"
"959040","961860"," continue to push forward, push forward humanity. "
"962540","964760"," I believe in the boring company."
"965260","972360"," I don't think that the boring company has anything to do with giving you a tunnel in Las Vegas."
"972760","978900"," I think it has more to do with the survival of humanity, believe it or not, as AI gets developed. "
"978900","983580"," I have an existential crisis with humanity being able to keep up to fight AI."
"984720","990080"," And other countries that are doing that, that can destroy the world, right?"
"990460","995080"," So I'm with Elon and a bunch of other people on this where it's a race."
"995460","998080"," We either become one with them with with AI. "
"998360","1005220"," We either become symbiotic with AI or eventually something really bad is likely to happen where one"
"1005220","1009920"," other country gets unleashes AI before we do or we lose the race to it."
"1011200","1016860"," Or even something terrible happens where it comes out of the box and it's able to kill a lot of"
"1016860","1017320"," people, right?"
"1017780","1018600"," For a lot of reasons."
"1018900","1019920"," Well, that's a whole other conversation. "
"1020320","1026599"," But from my perspective, if you've got three, three, you got NASA and you've got a bunch of other"
"1026599","1030740"," rocket companies, I want someone outside the box, someone's making like the internet right,"
"1031099","1031359"," Starlink."
"1032260","1037300"," You have to push that envelope for how long satellite internet for sailing and everything else is a"
"1037300","1037660"," disaster."
"1038240","1041380"," If it takes him to push that stuff and nobody else did it, right?"
"1041640","1042579"," That's the key point here. "
"1042960","1050340"," Even if you're out there calling Elon a fraud, I'll tell you what, no other company ever was doing"
"1050340","1051580"," that for you out there."
"1051800","1054340"," Okay, as a plug, as a small person out there."
"1055080","1059380"," And him doing that means a lot to me, you and everybody else out there. "
"1059820","1064840"," Now, whether he fails or goes bankrupt or he goes too crazy and he's out of the public eye at"
"1064840","1067320"," some point, I did in a hotel room, pissing in a bottle."
"1067620","1068660"," I really don't fucking care."
"1068780","1069420"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1069780","1071060"," I just can't really get that push forward."
"1071300","1076760"," And if you're young, you're likely going to see another Elon Musk or Howard Hughes in another 20"
"1076760","1079560"," years or 30 years down the road, right?"
"1079780","1084660"," So the exploration of space, getting to Mars, all that stuff, trying to push forward humanity."
"1086000","1087380"," That's why I like Elon. "
"1087380","1092940"," So now the other shit that comes along with Elon, all the baggage that comes along with him, I"
"1092940","1094200"," fucking can't stand it."
"1094320","1097740"," It has no fucking place and it's disgusting."
"1098160","1105300"," It's hard to, it's getting harder as time passes to square all that away, right?"
"1105680","1108240"," So it's a really hard thing being a Tesla bull. "
"1108840","1113120"," And the worst part about being a Tesla bull or even a Tesla bear, but if you're a Tesla bull"
"1113120","1119340"," or bear, but not Tesla Q and not Tesla gang, is you get pulled back and forth from both sides,"
"1119340","1119660"," right?"
"1120680","1122920"," They want you to pick a side, right?"
"1123800","1125900"," Like, nothing is facts or news anymore."
"1126340","1127620"," Everything is your opinion, right?"
"1128100","1132560"," You get fed and I get fed a lot of opinion out there and you're forced then on just opinion"
"1132560","1133720"," alone to make a decision."
"1134300","1139840"," Or if you don't like one thing about this thing or about this person, you have to be all in"
"1139840","1142520"," against him or all in for him 100%. "
"1142520","1144020"," And I just don't live in that world."
"1144020","1145080"," I'm not a part of that generation."
"1145320","1148340"," I'm a part of a generation where there's a gray to all of this stuff. "
"1148660","1150140"," So that's just me, okay?"
"1150240","1151700"," Just to lay that out there for you right now."
"1151840","1157180"," So if you're Tesla Q, Tesla gang, if you're Tesla bull, Tesla bear, please try to play nice with"
"1157180","1157460"," each other."
"1157840","1159040"," Please try to help each other out. "
"1159200","1159960"," You guys are retailers."
"1160740","1161340"," I am a retailer."
"1162100","1162620"," That's all you are. "
"1162820","1163800"," You're a pleb."
"1164120","1165800"," If there's a pantheon, we're nobodies."
"1166040","1167360"," We're like little tiny people out there. "
"1167480","1168040"," We don't mean shit."
"1169040","1170620"," So try to help each other out."
"1170620","1176420"," The only person that's ever looking out for you is likely your fellow retail trader on both sides"
"1176420","1176800"," of this. "
"1177240","1178520"," Try and help each other make money."
"1178920","1180580"," You guys are all losers, right?"
"1180780","1181320"," I'm a loser."
"1181840","1186100"," We are in a stock market and a machine where their job is to take our money. "
"1186460","1187140"," It's their playground."
"1187700","1189360"," They don't care if you're Tesla bull."
"1189700","1191100"," They don't care if you're Tesla bear. "
"1191240","1192160"," They don't care if you're Tesla Q."
"1192540","1194860"," They don't care if you're Tesla above gang."
"1195860","1201220"," This, what we're doing here has only to do with taking all of your money away from you."
"1201600","1206700"," So it's even in these time or even in specifically today, this type, this cyber truck launch"
"1206700","1207380"," launch. "
"1207960","1209500"," You got nobody watching out for you."
"1209580","1213080"," The closest thing you're ever going to find to someone watching out for you is other retailers."
"1213800","1216320"," Those are your only real other friends out there. "
"1216400","1219420"," So please don't burn each other's bridges down to you have no fucking friends."
"1220980","1221420"," Sorry."
"1222000","1223400"," You get to take that money home. "
"1223400","1225240"," If you got more, you guys help each other out."
"1225460","1226220"," Sellers and buyers."
"1227220","1231400"," The more that both of you can take your money home and you can really stick it to a fat"
"1231400","1232800"," old fuck from Wall Street. "
"1233060","1235320"," Some fat old white guy, big greasy hands."
"1235580","1236840"," He sticks his money's pocket."
"1236920","1238100"," He takes your money, right?"
"1238480","1240160"," And he shits it away in two minutes. "
"1240780","1242460"," I lived in Vale for years, right?"
"1242920","1247020"," They would pound your money and wine in like bottles of Christol, right?"
"1247020","1249500"," Louie Trey, hookers, whatever it is."
"1249740","1253500"," They don't give a fuck about your thoughts up or down on this stuff."
"1253860","1257240"," They only care that you put your cash in the box and they get to take it from you. "
"1257660","1258560"," So that's about what?"
"1258900","1260820"," 25% of the marketplace is your money."
"1261020","1263520"," So they, you know, and they want to manage your money, right?"
"1263860","1265900"," And give you a small return and collect the arm."
"1266100","1269480"," So, you know, just try to do your best to help each other out. "
"1269660","1273580"," Try to keep sight of who's really against you."
"1273620","1274680"," And that's the big boys out there."
"1275420","1276980"," Yeah, plebs unite, man, definitely. "
"1277460","1282740"," Don't become one of the plebs in the stands, tearing on other plebs, killing each other, or you"
"1282740","1285300"," guys killing each other in the stands and all that kind of stuff."
"1285540","1286680"," It's horrible to do that."
"1287180","1291180"," There's so much good life out there that you guys can help each other live a great life. "
"1291480","1292160"," So, all right."
"1292280","1293820"," So that's my rant on Tesla today."
"1293820","1294220"," It's done. "
"1297740","1298320"," That's done."
"1298920","1300200"," So it has a Tesla bull."
"1300920","1309520"," If you're a seller or buyer, not being Tesla gang or Tesla Q, I'm pretty objective about when to"
"1309520","1313940"," buy and sell Tesla or when it's the right time to buy Tesla or not buy Tesla because I'm a"
"1313940","1314080"," bull. "
"1314240","1316640"," I'm only going to tell you it's not the right time to buy it, right?"
"1317100","1319800"," I'm never going to tell you sell Tesla here, of course, but try not to."
"1320900","1324880"," But, you know, you're never going to hear me say like buy Tesla any price no matter what."
"1325020","1329200"," You're never going to see me telling a seller, keep selling, keep selling, keep selling that kind"
"1329200","1329460"," of stuff. "
"1332820","1333820"," Yeah, yeah, definitely."
"1334920","1336060"," Well, I'm not long here."
"1336120","1336840"," Oh, I know long here. "
"1337120","1337960"," I wasn't watching."
"1337960","1338760"," I wasn't paying attention."
"1339140","1341940"," The reason why I'll explain why I'm not long here right now though. "
"1342020","1342700"," That's a good question."
"1342820","1343580"," So let's talk about it."
"1343680","1343820"," Okay. "
"1344440","1345640"," Let's chat about being long."
"1345920","1346040"," Okay."
"1347180","1353960"," I've done a video before we get to the SPX in the JQ, the caller for JPM. "
"1354500","1362080"," We're going to talk about probability and statistics for going long and short."
"1362200","1362580"," Okay."
"1362580","1364900"," We're going to talk about that right now real quick. "
"1365540","1366580"," We're going to leave."
"1367040","1371340"," We're going to just exit right now because I have a lot of those questions that are building the"
"1371340","1372240"," past couple of weeks."
"1372240","1373960"," So let's just talk about that really quick. "
"1375680","1376140"," Okay."
"1376560","1379000"," Now, timeframe does not matter."
"1379780","1385260"," Could be a one minute chart, a five minute chart, a day chart, even a weekly chart does not matter. "
"1385900","1391600"," This is if you don't care if you're a long-term trader, short-term trader, special person, whatever"
"1391600","1394780"," you are out there, there's something you need to know."
"1394960","1395080"," Okay."
"1396040","1397180"," There's some rules here. "
"1398140","1399140"," There's some rules."
"1400440","1402720"," I want to first address that."
"1403080","1404740"," The one in five minute chart. "
"1405060","1409240"," Well, when day trading, the one in five minute chart, why should I shouldn't say it?"
"1409240","1409280"," Yeah."
"1409380","1415680"," The one in five minute chart day trading on a one minute chart, the one minute trigger in the five"
"1415680","1419760"," minute trigger, right, is trend on your day."
"1419760","1419920"," Okay. "
"1420080","1422260"," So we're on a one minute chart right now on spy."
"1423120","1427700"," As long as price stays below, we're bearish on the one in five."
"1428280","1432440"," As long as we have a bear cross, that would be a cross like this right here. "
"1433020","1436020"," The white line crossing the red line, we're bearish."
"1436140","1437260"," We are sellers, okay?"
"1437780","1438560"," Every time."
"1439120","1442300"," Sellers, we get that cross and price remains below. "
"1442980","1448580"," The next clue to you is that the white and red line."
"1448660","1451380"," If those are vertical, which they are right now, right?"
"1451540","1452600"," The white and red line are vertical."
"1453240","1454200"," That's bearish. "
"1454880","1461720"," If the white line starts to flatten out and go sideways and the red line begins to go sideways, you"
"1461720","1462240"," are neutral."
"1463100","1463140"," Okay."
"1463360","1470580"," If the white and red line cross over here and price gets above, you are now bullish for that for"
"1470580","1471960"," that white and red line. "
"1472200","1472320"," Okay."
"1473380","1475460"," Now, let's look at where we are today."
"1475780","1477220"," We are below the hourly trigger. "
"1477740","1479720"," The hourly trigger is turning down."
"1479880","1480780"," That's bearish."
"1481440","1484560"," Price is below the one minute in the five minute trigger. "
"1484900","1485860"," That's bearish."
"1486540","1488780"," I'm not seeing a flattening of the hourly trigger."
"1488960","1491820"," I'm not seeing the early trigger head higher, right?"
"1491980","1496080"," And I'm not seeing a flattening of the white, the one minute trigger, nor the five minute trigger. "
"1496260","1497620"," That's all bearish."
"1497720","1497900"," Okay."
"1497900","1502100"," So that's already telling me that we are bearish here. "
"1503660","1504580"," We're not bullish."
"1505220","1506060"," We're bearish."
"1506260","1510480"," So anyone's saying, why are you not long or no, no offense to you out of this box here. "
"1510580","1511660"," He's just asking, why are you not long?"
"1512040","1518640"," For those reasons right there are that's a litany of reasons not to be long or long calls I guess"
"1518640","1521020"," in it right now."
"1521020","1521360"," Okay."
"1522840","1527240"," Now, the thing that I'm going to show you right here is when we can show it to you on"
"1527240","1533200"," a, I'm going to show you this on, on a Webull, let me say I bring Webull up over here,"
"1533280","1533480"," hold on. "
"1537190","1538650"," Can I, hold on a second here."
"1547560","1548180"," All right."
"1548460","1551000"," So I'm going to show you something here on Webull, okay?"
"1552980","1554700"," So let's pick a ticker here. "
"1555840","1557640"," Maybe the cues to the cues."
"1558780","1559400"," This is a good one."
"1562520","1566760"," So this is a one minute chart on the cues, okay?"
"1567580","1569500"," You see the white and red line going down. "
"1569660","1569960"," That's vertical."
"1570260","1571520"," See it's starting to flatten."
"1571800","1572920"," Not quite turned yet, right?"
"1574040","1577800"," Whenever you see a cross of this white line through the red line, that's bearish. "
"1578120","1582460"," If you see a cross of the white line and the red line, that is bullish."
"1582840","1585540"," And you can see that cross happening right now, right on spy."
"1586980","1588620"," You can see that cross happening. "
"1588820","1589860"," See the red line right here."
"1590040","1590780"," Hold me show this to you."
"1590780","1594150"," See that red line?"
"1594510","1598050"," And if you see this cross of the white line right here, right?"
"1599950","1601390"," This is what I'm going to show you. "
"1601390","1603510"," This is the important thing that I'm going to show you here, okay?"
"1604350","1606070"," Now this hasn't happened yet, right?"
"1606690","1607850"," So it's not there, right?"
"1607950","1609410"," So it's not bullish yet, is it?"
"1610370","1613510"," So you have the squeeze coming up right now in a one minute trigger."
"1614150","1616270"," Your previous high right here, right?"
"1616670","1617910"," This is the toolbook toolbox."
"1618590","1618970"," Hold on. "
"1620190","1622930"," This is your, this is your previous high, right?"
"1623190","1627630"," As the cross is made, price is crossing, white has not crossed red yet."
"1628550","1633190"," What bulls need to see is a new high from the previous high."
"1633410","1641180"," So right there, bulls need to get above this to instigate a change of direction. "
"1641940","1649700"," So right now, if you were buying calls here, right, you have about a 30% chance that direction is"
"1649700","1654980"," changing, the probability of directional change here of about 30%."
"1654980","1665270"," As price comes up, if it breaks higher here, right,"
"1665330","1671650"," a directional change goes from about a 30% probability to about a 45% probability."
"1672390","1674910"," You should then see a reversal. "
"1675510","1680950"," This is on every time frame, one minute, five minute, 15 minute, hour, day, weekly, doesn't matter."
"1681770","1689920"," So if you see price come up and actually make a new high, right, you would say, oh, I got"
"1689920","1691760"," about a 45% chance, right?"
"1692000","1693420"," Are you, are you long here though?"
"1693620","1694580"," No, you're not."
"1694780","1695440"," You believe it or not?"
"1695580","1696100"," Are you not long?"
"1696260","1697300"," You're just watching for it. "
"1697680","1698760"," You've got your eye on it."
"1698880","1701520"," You, you're not going to survive this market with a 30% chance."
"1702320","1704940"," So this should come back down right here, right?"
"1706240","1715840"," And then what you'll end up seeing is you'll see the actual cross of the white line here with a"
"1715840","1725100"," one minute trigger will cross the five minute trigger and you're at about a 45% chance of a win"
"1725100","1725860"," right here, right?"
"1726420","1732640"," Now you're going to be watching this red bar that comes down and you're going to just be watching. "
"1733240","1737720"," And if this gets bought again, right, you should swing back up here."
"1737720","1743160"," You can, you can set up some calls in here if you like, if it gets bought and you're going"
"1743160","1748800"," to expect to then go out and take out the next I right here."
"1750160","1752780"," You want to see that that's still not bullish. "
"1753580","1756560"," That turns into about if it pops up here, right?"
"1757700","1767580"," That then turns into about a 75% probability of a, of a directional, a change of direction in the"
"1767580","1767900"," market."
"1767900","1774940"," You'll then see this blast right back down, believe it or not, but if you caught that, if you, if"
"1774940","1780300"," you have that new high and this new high right here, right, your second tag of that five minute,"
"1780660","1786800"," this is the one that becomes your 95% chance of mooning."
"1787880","1790440"," And this actually goes way, way, way, way higher. "
"1791740","1794640"," If you see this structure right here, okay?"
"1795320","1802280"," If you see that structure right there, when you come back down to that second tag right here, this"
"1802280","1812280"," becomes a, a confirmed 95% of the time directional change in whatever ticker"
"1812280","1812940"," you're trading."
"1813140","1820360"," And this price is going to go moon literally for a day or two days or three days."
"1820360","1825640"," If you're on a five minute chart, it'll be for, I should say this is one day on a one"
"1825640","1832700"," minute chart, five minute chart, three days to five days, 15 minute chart about five days or price,"
"1833020","1834100"," it's days or price. "
"1835220","1840840"," And if you see it on an hourly or a four hour or a daily, it can be days, weeks"
"1840840","1843440"," and months a directional shift."
"1843600","1848500"," I'm going to show you this directional shift on multi-time frames in just a moment."
"1849260","1857240"," Now, the reason I'm telling you your percentages here is because oftentimes, when you, not me, when"
"1857240","1862060"," you were out there, then you're like, well, it failed captain, right?"
"1862480","1864040"," It's in here that you're failing. "
"1864400","1868380"," This is where you're losing your money all in here because this will roll down on you."
"1868800","1871300"," This one will fail and roll down on you."
"1871460","1876980"," And then you get your ass blasted and you're upside down and you're directionally wrong, right?"
"1876980","1879400"," You're like, hey, it was going my direction that it turned on me. "
"1880000","1886340"," You need to get those two or three, you need to get those two or three confirmations before you can"
"1886340","1894900"," see a true directional change for a length of time that you can trade and be right about 95%"
"1894900","1901560"," of the time, 95, that high, that good, where you can take that trade with confidence, slam the buy"
"1901560","1904440"," or sell button and know that you're going to get paid."
"1905190","1912000"," Now, inside of this, you can still trade this like you could trade from here to here."
"1913000","1919380"," You come back down and you successfully do this and you can trade here to here, but you can't"
"1919380","1921360"," commit to it for any length of time. "
"1921880","1928500"," When you come back down here and back up here, this one though, you can commit to with safety for"
"1928500","1929880"," a long period of time."
"1929880","1934520"," And I'm going to show you that right now, that explanation of that right now, okay?"
"1935660","1940160"," So matter of fact, right here you had, you had this previous high, right?"
"1940440","1947160"," You got it right there, then you came back down and retested and then blasted up, right?"
"1948040","1952000"," And you're going to take out all these previous highs, one, two and three."
"1952600","1957760"," Now, now let me explain this better for you or give you a better visual representation, okay?"
"1958420","1961540"," I'm going to show you a one minute, this is a one minute chart, okay?"
"1963060","1969480"," Do you see how, do you see how, once that cross happens, we have a length of time that we're"
"1969480","1970540"," going down, right?"
"1971300","1978660"," Whenever that cross takes place again and is confirmed, you should get a long period of time up"
"1978660","1987300"," move in the market and we can show that examples of that day in, day out, day out, cross right"
"1987300","1991580"," here, downside move, cross to the upside right here, upside move. "
"1992080","1997380"," If you look at it in a five minute, where's the five minute chart now, I'll show you the same"
"1997380","2003720"," thing, here's price below, five minute bear cross, we're below it, right?"
"2004660","2009180"," There's no confirmation yet on a five minute that we're going any higher, is there?"
"2009630","2019500"," You need to actually see this turn here, this turn here to have any kind of sustained"
"2019500","2026260"," rally for longer than just the day, this would be possibly into tomorrow, you'd want to see this"
"2026260","2033160"," right here, consolidates, come back up here, up there, consolidates and then that's actually,"
"2033500","2041500"," that's your actual, that's your actual 95% trade for a huge move, that's for a length of time."
"2042120","2047860"," If you do this on a 15 minute basis, you'll see the same thing, right?"
"2049690","2054600"," So if people ask you what time frame you're bullish on, or are you bullish short term, long term,"
"2054760","2061040"," medium term, right now are you bullish on a 15 minute time frame, no, are you bullish on a five"
"2061040","2066840"," minute time frame, not yet, are you bullish right now in a one minute time frame, almost, we're"
"2066840","2071500"," going to check, we're going to go, we're going to come back and check right now, that cross and"
"2071500","2077260"," move higher, let's look at different other time frames on a 30 minute time frame, are you bullish"
"2077260","2084560"," right now, no, you've got a bear cross right here, right, so you're not bullish on 30 minutes, and"
"2084560","2092760"," hourly, are you bullish, no, you just had an hourly cross here, that means you should expect an"
"2092760","2101220"," extended period of time on an hourly chart for days, or big price moves to the downside, if we come"
"2101220","2108600"," up here and confirm, right, the downside move on an hourly basis, we reject right there and start"
"2108600","2115480"," heading down, and that would last like three to five days, or pretty big downside move, and you can"
"2115480","2121660"," also look at this on a four hour basis here, right, we haven't had a cross on four hours yet,"
"2121980","2130120"," heavily, no confirmation that we have major blood coming on a four hour basis, for a very long"
"2130120","2138060"," period of time, we haven't seen this action yet here, where you have the cross, where you have the"
"2138060","2145780"," cross, you come back up limit, you"
"2145780","2154000"," squeeze back up on a four hour basis, and then you get rejected to the downside, bam, big four hour"
"2154000","2158040"," candles, and that's bad news, I'm going to show you right here on a four hour basis, what I'm"
"2158040","2164180"," talking about, okay, so here's the cues, so when you're out there in your social media world,"
"2164180","2171700"," right, when you're in your social media world, and you hear people say to you things like, I think"
"2171700","2176860"," we're going to sell today, right, over here they're telling you they think they're we're going to"
"2176860","2182760"," sell today, on a four hour basis, you see that bull cross right there, what is that telling you,"
"2182860","2187980"," there's going to be an upside move for extended period of time, and price is not below that white"
"2187980","2192820"," line is it, so if they're telling you that I usually laugh at those people, I'm like that fucking"
"2192820","2196740"," guy has no idea what he's talking about, he's out of his fucking mind, right, on a four hour basis"
"2196740","2202260"," we're going up, same thing over here, on a four hour basis you get the cross, and you're going to"
"2202260","2211320"," look for an extended move either time or price to the downside to known supply or demand, okay, so"
"2211320","2216500"," just think about that, like you should be doing this every day, when you're at home you should be"
"2216500","2222920"," on every ticker, every ticker, it doesn't matter what it is, if it's Tesla, we can look at Tesla,"
"2223420","2230280"," and the same thing holds true, you see the bull cross here, it did not confirm, but it did come"
"2230280","2234840"," back up and you got the bull cross again, it went straight up to the moon, same thing on a"
"2234840","2241400"," one hour basis, right, same thing on a 15 minute basis, same thing on smaller timeframes, it really"
"2241400","2248440"," doesn't matter, now you can still trade this, this is a one minute basis right now in Tesla, right,"
"2249320","2256360"," you got your cross, you're coming back in right now to test it right on Tesla, now what do you"
"2256360","2260120"," do if you're a bull right here, now if you flip this chart upside down you can do the same"
"2260120","2265020"," thing as a bear, so right now what do you do where we are on Tesla right now on a"
"2265020","2271660"," one minute basis, this looks great by the way for Tesla, so you would take along for calls here,"
"2272400","2278000"," right, you're not like hey I'm bullish for fucking five days, you're just bullish on a one minute"
"2278000","2285400"," frame right here, you're going to get along here, put stops down below, right, and you're going to"
"2285400","2292080"," look for this squeeze to trade up to a previous high that you haven't beaten yet, so as a matter"
"2292080","2298140"," of fact right now on Tesla you haven't beaten this one yet, so on this cross, this check right"
"2298140","2303840"," here, your expectation is that you're going to trade, excuse me, just that right there, you're"
"2303840","2310000"," going to come back down and check the check the one minute trigger and you'll likely trade this"
"2310000","2318400"," next one up here, okay, right up there with stops at each cross road, a stop right here, right, and"
"2318400","2323380"," a stop right here in case it fails on you, so that's how you that's how you have a trading"
"2323380","2330820"," plan right on multi-time frames, if you had a one hour, if you had a one hour chart on"
"2330820","2337480"," on cues, actually Tesla's very manipulative but hold on this is a better one to look at but let's"
"2337480","2343140"," look at a test, let's look at cues on a one minute basis, okay, funny I want to show you"
"2343140","2350900"," this one right here, so you come back in right, I'm long baby, whoo, come back down test this right"
"2350900","2356100"," here, boom, right, what are you doing, you're putting on a long position because you're still"
"2356100","2361400"," above, right, there's no cross yet, you're putting your stops underneath, right, in case you get"
"2361400","2367000"," blasted, you're managing your trade on an hourly basis, if that doesn't fail, you're still good to"
"2367000","2371620"," go, right, yeah, who we're going, we're going, we're going, right, makes sense, what's the other"
"2371620","2375740"," thing we can take away from which I showed you earlier is an hourly basis, near vertical, right,"
"2376140","2383040"," near vertical, right, neutral, right, neutral, neutral, neutral, neutral, no roll yet on Tesla, no"
"2383040","2387880"," doom gloom yet, there could be but we're flattening, notice that cyclical nature on the hourly"
"2387880","2394540"," trend, right, just notice that cyclical nature on it, so and I'm going to explain some of this"
"2394540","2400760"," later for you too, I'm the next part of this tool, okay, and that's not getting caught in"
"2400760","2407420"," consolidation, then I'm going to show this for you right here, okay, I'm going to show it for you"
"2407420","2414660"," on a four hour basis right now for cues, this is a four hour basis, you'll see this on a"
"2414660","2420360"," one minute chart happen too, so on a one minute basis, this is the zone of death, if any of"
"2420360","2425460"," you guys know who the goat is, he's a live streamer that's on YouTube, he's one of my heroes,"
"2425840","2430720"," right, you know, he is, he talks about this, everybody calls it, I think he calls it the don't"
"2430720","2436780"," diddle in the middle, on this is a 27 or a 30 EMA, this is a 129 EMA right here,"
"2437620","2443640"," if you see something like this on any timeframe, then you see this being bought back up, and we"
"2443640","2449900"," come back up into this zone of death right here, if you're trading a four hour timeframe, you don't"
"2449900","2456060"," trade this as a, as, excuse me, you're not going to get involved in this, because what they'll do"
"2456060","2460720"," in here over this four hour time period is they will wreck bulls and bears, you could trade this"
"2460720","2472060"," zone on a lower timeframe at this point, like up down, among them short, among them short, among"
"2472060","2475280"," them short, among them short, but you shouldn't be while price is in here, you got no business"
"2475280","2475880"," doing that."
"2476920","2480560"," So if you're up in here, hold on, if you're up in here and you're, and this is happening in"
"2480560","2484760"," here in this four hour basis, you got no business telling people which way this price is actually"
"2484760","2486300"," going to break in a four hour basis. "
"2486800","2493360"," Now, if we break below and begin to reject in a four hour basis, you set up a short right"
"2493360","2499100"," there, you got one rejection, two rejections on a four hour basis, you can then take this with"
"2499100","2500220"," confidence to the downside."
"2501060","2508040"," If this breaks to the upside, right, whoop, it'll back check itself, it'll actually back check"
"2508040","2512660"," itself way up there too, come back down and that's your confirmation that you're heading higher"
"2512660","2513180"," right there."
"2513540","2516660"," And you can begin to get longs with some confidence here, does that make sense?"
"2517220","2520340"," And this works on every timeframe, 15 minutes, you'll find them. "
"2521120","2522980"," Here's, obviously, I'm going to find one right here."
"2523440","2524420"," Oh, let me find something flat."
"2527480","2528360"," Oh, hold on a second here. "
"2533150","2534930"," I don't see any in here right now."
"2534970","2538570"," I don't see any consolidation moves in this 15 minute right now."
"2538570","2539350"," So I don't see anything in here. "
"2539370","2540070"," It's too shady."
"2540650","2544490"," This part right here, I don't like daytime price actions in here."
"2544550","2546610"," This could have broke straight down to the depths of hell. "
"2546790","2549210"," You want to get above that consolidation zone."
"2549370","2553050"," Then you can take that with confidence to the upside for an extended period of time."
"2553090","2556930"," So you can like set the trade up long or short here and long or short right here. "
"2557170","2562550"," And you can actually see this that goes one, two, and then it's off and running to the upside."
"2565330","2565990"," Think tighter."
"2566930","2567830"," Get rid of that. "
"2569430","2576190"," Now saying all that with this tool that we have here, right, this tool that we use here, with this"
"2576190","2579670"," tool that we use here, there are some hints that you can get from the tool."
"2580110","2581330"," And that's velocity."
"2581490","2583550"," And that's this stuff right here that I show you. "
"2584330","2591210"," Pickers trade on different velocities, different accumulations and distributions on different time"
"2591210","2591530"," frames."
"2592330","2597750"," And you can usually use these these velocity indicators for the length of time that you're bullish"
"2597750","2600990"," or bearish and you're overall bullish or bearishness."
"2601470","2607050"," If I go to a 30 minute time frame, it shows right here a daily time frame, right. "
"2607270","2612650"," You can actually see spy on a daily time frame is that 46 right now."
"2612650","2618410"," As soon as that thing hits 50 on a daily, you're you're really long in the tooth."
"2618410","2624050"," So my bullish right now in spy, I am probably until the end of today or tomorrow. "
"2624410","2630010"," I am bullish on spy until it taps out on 50 plus 50 over here on a daily basis."
"2630550","2638490"," Now we're saying that if I wanted to buy a spy call, if I if I'm seeing this ramp up"
"2638490","2646450"," here, right, seeing that ramp up there in a daily basis, when am I trying to buy spy on that"
"2646450","2651390"," daily daily bullishness would be on hourly negative velocity."
"2651510","2656950"," So if I can see hourly negative loss, so we're bullish here, right, but that hourly negative is"
"2656950","2657670"," down here too. "
"2657890","2660530"," I got both of these matched up to half hours matched up."
"2660530","2667350"," It's like I try 30 minute chart by the way."
"2668770","2671070"," Anyways, I got a big video series on this. "
"2671370","2675070"," And when you guys get this video series, I think it's coming out this week at some point."
"2675690","2679270"," You'll get a video series that will describe this in in fine detail."
"2680190","2683250"," And you'll get a white paper as well that explains all this in more detail. "
"2684750","2692450"," So if you're asking me why am I not long here earlier, I need to personally see more proof that"
"2692450","2693310"," we're going up."
"2694130","2695830"," So here's spy right now, right?"
"2696430","2700890"," You have a potential cross coming as a one minute chart, your potential cross coming here, right?"
"2701390","2702130"," Hold on a second."
"2706120","2708120"," You have potential cross coming in here. "
"2708200","2711160"," You can see the red and the white."
"2712440","2712780"," Come on here."
"2717420","2719800"," You see this red and white right here, right?"
"2722220","2724700"," And our next supply zone is right here, right?"
"2724900","2726060"," That's our next supply zone. "
"2727320","2730040"," I want to see this cross here."
"2731680","2735900"," And I want to see the price action."
"2736400","2737200"," Squeeze up. "
"2737980","2739780"," Take out that previous high."
"2740280","2741900"," Maybe even this one right here."
"2742020","2743180"," That's actually the next one right there. "
"2743840","2745640"," And then take that trade right there."
"2745800","2747680"," And I'll take that one to take that money."
"2748160","2750340"," Chaching money for Captain Jim James. "
"2750880","2752800"," And it's a high probability trade."
"2753160","2753880"," High probability."
"2754620","2757740"," Very important that you're trading high probability trades. "
"2758760","2764740"," People that have been following me here for years will tell you that I will get greedy."
"2766620","2773100"," And I will take a trade long or short without those confirmation trades before those confirmation"
"2773100","2774100"," bars before."
"2774700","2777600"," And I will get rolled to the downside and I'll lose all my money. "
"2777940","2779340"," I don't like losing my money."
"2779700","2782260"," I like having a high rate of high win rate."
"2782580","2786920"," And if it goes against me, first I want to set the trade up so it's a high win rate. "
"2787340","2792360"," And then the second thing that I want to do is be able to manage if it goes against me."
"2792580","2795120"," The small percentage of time that it goes against me."
"2795400","2797940"," I know that I can get out of that trade. "
"2798680","2802600"," And I know that I know that I'm not going to lose my ass, right?"
"2803060","2803660"," I'm managing."
"2804220","2805120"," I'm planning out."
"2805520","2808380"," And I have, I have, this is how I make my money, right?"
"2808560","2809680"," This is like, this is what I do. "
"2810040","2810960"," This I make my living."
"2811140","2812060"," This is who I am."
"2812400","2814200"," And this, this doesn't matter what you're trading. "
"2814320","2819480"," Doesn't matter if you're trading a shit stock, a meme stock, the best stock that's out there."
"2820780","2823260"," You should be using these tools in your trading."
"2823260","2828680"," If you don't have these tools, just this basic stuff that I went over with you, not even the tool"
"2828680","2830280"," that I have, my tool, right?"
"2830280","2834360"," If you don't have those tools, you need to get those tools in your life. "
"2834800","2840380"," They're going to save you so much heart heartache and pain and so much losses."
"2840540","2846960"," Dude, I have lost probably like three big trades I've lost, probably 375."
"2848220","2855400"," Can't even count the millions I've lost from not trading using those rules. "
"2855860","2856620"," I can't tell you."
"2856740","2861200"," And whenever I use those rules, I am a fucking gangster trader."
"2861880","2866520"," I will put my trading up against anyone out there trading like that. "
"2867340","2871620"," Anybody and there might be a few people that beat me, but I know that I'm a part of that"
"2871620","2877280"," very small percentage of traders and investors that understands these mechanics so that you can"
"2877280","2879660"," actually manage your trades up and down."
"2880020","2882640"," Now, maybe you're getting caught on a one minute chart."
"2882640","2892260"," If you use this same technique on a higher time frame, a four hour or a daily time frame, you're"
"2892260","2894620"," going to make a ton of money in this market. "
"2894860","2900920"," If you only come out to play as a bear or a bull on a daily basis using what I"
"2900920","2905360"," just showed you, you are going to make tons of money."
"2906100","2912620"," And another fact about this that's really neat is you'll often see when these crosses are"
"2912620","2917600"," happening, happening up or down in a one minute chart, do you ever notice you'll hear people say,"
"2918040","2920200"," oh, we just had a liquidation break, right?"
"2920420","2921400"," Oh, just liquidation break."
"2921920","2929500"," They're stop hunting you right when those big moves are coming on those key places where I just"
"2929500","2930040"," showed you. "
"2930680","2939920"," You'll see us like, you'll see us, here's this cross happens, right?"
"2940100","2945980"," If we're going to go come back and test this and go up, you'll oftentimes right at that moment"
"2945980","2951180"," there on that cross, you'll see the liquidation break and then the tweezers straight back up."
"2951940","2952120"," Okay."
"2952960","2957920"," And as a matter of fact, even if it's going to roll down on you, you're 70% of the"
"2957920","2963720"," time you're given the opportunity for that squeeze back up again and a second one before it"
"2963720","2964920"," actually rolls to the downside. "
"2965720","2973780"," This market literally, depending upon the time frame you're on, even on a one hour basis, 70% of"
"2973780","2982060"," the time, if you are wrong in this thesis, you are still given a chance to unfuck yourself."
"2982740","2987280"," So if you're stopped, I'm going to draw"
"2991790","3002000"," this out"
"3006800","3009320"," you come back down, let's say, boom, right here, right?"
"3009460","3010500"," You're like, all right, fuck that cap."
"3010900","3011780"," They're buying it. "
"3012680","3017280"," I'm going to take a long here and you're like, okay, you got to wait for a few bars and"
"3017280","3018020"," you're like, okay, boss."
"3018600","3024160"," So you start to see this going green and it reverses on you and they trapped you're at a bull"
"3024160","3027340"," trap and it actually red bars straight down, right?"
"3028480","3032200"," You're likely like like 70% of the time you're going to be given a chance."
"3033480","3037640"," You're going to see one more green bar up and you'll see exhaustion from buyers. "
"3038580","3040360"," This is exhaustive from buyers."
"3040360","3048280"," They failed to get back up and you actually have the chance to sell your calls or close your longs,"
"3048860","3051640"," owning spy or whatever it is, the underlying or whatever."
"3051980","3057260"," You actually, you're actually given a chance to close before the big reversal to the downside,"
"3058660","3062380"," okay, where you're like, bam, bam, bam, now is it every time?"
"3062400","3068680"," No, but it's like 70, 80, 90% of the time high enough rates that you will always be up"
"3068680","3069960"," on your trading account. "
"3071000","3072480"," It makes sense to you guys."
"3072640","3074200"," Maybe this makes sense or maybe it doesn't."
"3076520","3078200"," Now my tool, right?"
"3078380","3085560"," My tool that I have here, this one right here, right, is a cheat cheat for you. "
"3086680","3088500"," This cheat sheet shows you velocity."
"3089380","3090840"," Velocity right now is what?"
"3091120","3094940"," Neutral and slightly bullish, right?"
"3095620","3098100"," Positioning right now is short."
"3099120","3108500"," That red box will not turn green until you have about a 70 to 95% chance of us going"
"3108500","3108820"," up. "
"3109020","3114480"," Now it doesn't track once we're done going down or done, done going up, but it does track the"
"3114480","3119180"," instant, the moment that we revert, we start getting bearish or we start getting bullish."
"3119900","3122300"," So right now, what is this thing telling me?"
"3122960","3124860"," Do not get long, captain."
"3125220","3128060"," And I don't even, I don't even follow my own shit sometimes. "
"3128200","3134800"," You'll see me in this, you'll see me in this stream, take along when we're still saying short and"
"3134800","3135820"," I'll get run over."
"3136840","3142220"," So I know I pushed this, but you know, I'm a human like you are, right?"
"3142300","3143000"," I'm a human like you are."
"3143000","3145600"," You guys get to see me seven hours a day. "
"3146060","3148740"," You guys get to see me make mistakes."
"3148940","3150760"," You guys get to see me speak wrong."
"3150920","3152760"," You guys get to see me get greedy. "
"3152760","3154400"," You guys get to see me get emotional."
"3155060","3156320"," You guys get to see me get angry."
"3156420","3159260"," You guys get to see me very happy some days, right?"
"3159500","3163760"," So and that's part of this for what I'm doing with you guys is I want you to see the"
"3163760","3169860"," full range of emotions and thought processes, greed, happiness, anger. "
"3170300","3171600"," I want you to see all of that stuff."
"3172020","3172320"," Why?"
"3173100","3175280"," Because people don't show you that stuff."
"3175980","3180960"," If you watch other people out there with programs out there on YouTube, Twitch, wherever, right?"
"3181160","3182340"," You see people on Twitter. "
"3182720","3184440"," You see people on Reddit."
"3184720","3189000"," You see people on Wall Street Bats or Stock Quits old school Yahoo message boards wherever."
"3189520","3191420"," They only show you their best face. "
"3192020","3196740"," They only show you their best side and they craft what you're seeing, right?"
"3197120","3203240"," They make sure that you only get a crafted experience and only you own that that portrays the"
"3203240","3204600"," perfectness of that person."
"3205980","3214840"," That is missing in a lot of of our retail trading community to show the wins, the losses, the"
"3214840","3219860"," anger, the happiness, the ecstaticness, the different emotions and thought processes."
"3221080","3227220"," And you know, all of it together, you'll see people out there tell you I'm a sociopath, right?"
"3227960","3229520"," I only trade the price action. "
"3229820","3233080"," I fucking assure you in the background, that's not always the case."
"3233540","3236100"," They are humans and they're going to make mistakes."
"3236420","3244480"," And it's a bad thing for you to to only have a crafted experience in your growth as a young"
"3244480","3245520"," trader or investor. "
"3245940","3251120"," You need to see all the good and the bad that's not shown to you so that you don't feel"
"3251120","3253800"," like you're the only person out there fucking up, right?"
"3254240","3258260"," You're the only person out there like, why are all these guys out there on Fintuit and they sell"
"3258260","3259860"," the market the right time every time?"
"3260340","3263220"," Why are they always dang but banging, right?"
"3263800","3265120"," And why do I suck so bad?"
"3265720","3266780"," Because they're not showing you."
"3267220","3272820"," They're not showing you what a real life is for a real trader, a real investor, any of that kind"
"3272820","3273120"," of stuff."
"3273280","3274420"," They don't want you to see that. "
"3274480","3277760"," They want you to see a crafted experience at all times."
"3278280","3279220"," So I'm not that guy."
"3279320","3280460"," I'm never going to be that guy too. "
"3280520","3283560"," You're never going to know me as a person and have me be fake."
"3283780","3289020"," I got a wife, kids, longtime wife, like my life, how I live it, you see it, how it is."
"3289860","3296420"," And I, when I was a young guy, young trader, I only got that very rarely did I get that"
"3296420","3296980"," from people. "
"3297740","3302200"," My mentors that I looked up towards like Bob Kendall is one of those guys, right?"
"3302340","3305240"," You got some of you guys, Bob Kendall is one of my teachers and mentors."
"3305420","3306960"," I've got other ones out there as well."
"3308160","3313320"," Those guys to get that experience from people when they make a mistake or do something wrong or get"
"3313320","3318160"," it wrong or don't manage the trade properly, you're never going to become a great trader unless you"
"3318160","3319280"," go through that process. "
"3319280","3323860"," And if you have somebody next to you going through that process with you, it only makes you a"
"3323860","3324660"," better fucking trader."
"3324840","3325900"," You can't pay for that shit."
"3326360","3326920"," You can't. "
"3327040","3328240"," No one wants to sell it to you."
"3328260","3329640"," They want to sell you a crafted experience."
"3330060","3334360"," So if you're able to latch on to somebody out there that can teach you that stuff, whether it's in"
"3334360","3338360"," our discord or it's someone that you like on Twitter or it's someone that you like on Wall Street"
"3338360","3341640"," bets or whatever is out there, latch on to those people. "
"3342020","3346560"," You guys ever notice when you're watching a social media personality, they're either like, they're"
"3346560","3348700"," either like frat bros, right?"
"3348920","3352060"," Just growing it up on a show or what are they doing?"
"3352060","3356940"," They're talking to you in a way that is obscure, right?"
"3357100","3358480"," Where you don't really understand what they're talking about."
"3358480","3362540"," You're like, I don't care what this guy's saying over here or they're intentionally not telling you"
"3362540","3363840"," their thesis, right?"
"3363960","3366980"," We're going up or going down or this or that or even their positioning."
"3367760","3369860"," They'll come back to you later and tell you that stuff. "
"3369860","3373820"," They'll explain things to you in a theoretical way, right?"
"3374020","3377140"," They might even be reading off a prompter to you and you don't even know it."
"3377300","3382260"," When you get recorded videos, you know when I record videos, I can record like an hour long video"
"3382260","3386220"," and I get to go back in and edit exactly what that video says."
"3386720","3388280"," Now there are times where that's good. "
"3388600","3392700"," If I'm trying to get across a point to you without mistakes, it's good to edit those videos."
"3393240","3398580"," But you'll never see those that craft that crafted video show you any mistakes."
"3399080","3399600"," Does that make sense?"
"3400060","3400920"," You'll never see that mistake. "
"3401120","3406420"," So a lot of your heroes out there, you like that guy knows what he's talking about or that lady"
"3406420","3407420"," knows what she's talking about."
"3407500","3413020"," That's mostly crafted for you to consume so that you think they're smarter than they actually are"
"3413020","3417280"," or that they don't ever lose or that they don't ever make a mistake or they don't ever miss"
"3417280","3418400"," something out there."
"3418500","3424840"," So that's the point that I'm trying to make to you is that what we do here is basically day"
"3424840","3431420"," in, day out, grind bootcamp or you to become a successful winner. "
"3432060","3432480"," You win."
"3432720","3433860"," You don't burn your money anymore."
"3433940","3438320"," You start to actually make money, put your job, whatever goals that you have and actually start to"
"3438320","3439960"," walk with cash in your hands. "
"3440140","3444220"," I don't care if you're a seller or a buyer and I really appreciate when you come to me as"
"3444220","3447960"," a bull or a bear so that I can pull you out of that bull bear and make you a"
"3447960","3452500"," buyer and seller so you know where supply and demand is and all that other stuff that goes along"
"3452500","3452880"," with it."
"3453000","3456060"," So you guys got to get all that right now anyways."
"3459700","3465180"," If you don't understand what I'm talking about, you need to get in our Discord, you're going to get"
"3465180","3471740"," a video series released this week that step-by-step teaches you this stuff and you're getting this"
"3471740","3473720"," tool released to you this week as well. "
"3473980","3476900"," So you should be able to come along with us and do your thing."
"3477180","3482840"," I assure you, you run through this program with me, you'll be, you'll leave as a better, a better"
"3482840","3484200"," trader investor over time."
"3484440","3485500"," I assure you, you will. "
"3485640","3489240"," I get emails, DMs all week."
"3489440","3490480"," All week, I get DMs all week."
"3490640","3491780"," Thank you, thank you, thank you. "
"3492100","3496220"," Because even if they hate me as a person, they take those tools, they go on their own and they"
"3496220","3498080"," do their own thing to become a better trader and investor."
"3499100","3499680"," All right."
"3500960","3501720"," All right. "
"3501880","3502000"," All right."
"3502180","3503480"," So let's get back to, let's get back to this."
"3503640","3505340"," Hey, thanks, recovering alcohol at bear. "
"3506480","3507020"," All right."
"3509440","3510820"," Making a difference, baby."
"3510980","3514820"," Making a community and a difference so we can fuck up Wall Street. "
"3515900","3516560"," That's the truth."
"3516820","3517840"," I'll be honest with you."
"3518440","3525940"," Now, this is the whole entire intent of this is to mess with ours, is to take, they're not to"
"3525940","3526480"," take their money. "
"3526720","3527480"," Yeah, I guess take their money."
"3528120","3534180"," In my view, it's me and you, me, how many, are you, gives me, people watch this show, like between,"
"3534400","3539780"," between YouTube and Twitch, it's like 5,000 viewers."
"3540480","3545700"," And I have friends here that play this show in, believe it or not, inside hedge funds offices. "
"3546860","3551780"," We have people that restream the show in Europe with thousands of people that I don't see, don't"
"3551780","3552260"," even know."
"3552980","3559180"," So we're here every day with thousands and thousands of spy traders every single day, teaching a"
"3559180","3564140"," new young generation of spy traders, index traders for this next generation."
"3564620","3565600"," So this stuff isn't lost. "
"3566020","3570680"," When you guys see me hanging out with a Jedi Marcus, you know, that guy was a pit trader and"
"3570680","3572220"," there's no more pit trading, right?"
"3572500","3573940"," These guys are gonna be gone one day."
"3574540","3575300"," You know, I'm friends with them."
"3575440","3576000"," I like the guy. "
"3576120","3577180"," You want to, why else like the guy?"
"3577620","3583120"," Because he's out there giving retailers all of his knowledge and any, any constant, right?"
"3583500","3585260"," Big time Blackwater guy, right?"
"3585260","3588220"," He's out here on Twitter helping you as a retailer."
"3588760","3595120"," You're gonna be like a sponge and soak all that stuff up so we don't lose all of this information"
"3595120","3600040"," that needs to be passed along to these next generations of retail traders."
"3601160","3602820"," So please, if you're young, right?"
"3603640","3604760"," Suck all this stuff up. "
"3605140","3606820"," Suck up the stuff that Amy tells you."
"3606860","3610540"," If you don't understand, Annie, you come find me and I'll, I'll, I'll dumb it down for you."
"3610840","3612300"," Go find a guy like Jenny Marcus. "
"3612560","3613880"," The whole bunch, you guys can list these guys."
"3614120","3616260"," There's a whole bunch of other pit traders that are on."
"3616620","3617940"," You got gem out there. "
"3618060","3619580"," You got all kinds of guys out there."
"3619900","3621740"," The women men, you get Helen, right?"
"3621980","3623120"," Helen, Helen's out there."
"3623220","3627000"," Helen Meisler's out there all the time giving you guys all kinds of nuggets of information. "
"3627620","3628400"," You should make a sponge."
"3629120","3630720"," One day those people aren't gonna be here anymore."
"3631200","3635180"," One day those people are gonna be gone and that shit's gonna be lost to the sands of time. "
"3635880","3641040"," So it's your job and my job to drag that out of them and try to then pass it along"
"3641040","3642640"," to other people as time passes."
"3644440","3646220"," I say Meiser."
"3646600","3651320"," When I say, I say the wrong name, possibly. "
"3653620","3655440"," Okay, so you guys get the gist here, right?"
"3656340","3659340"," So I'm watching all this right now, watching all this right now."
"3659360","3660840"," I still have a red box over here."
"3661420","3662800"," I still haven't taken a trade. "
"3663020","3664540"," You could have taken that trade right there."
"3664940","3666000"," You could have taken this trade."
"3666560","3667520"," You know, a five minute trade. "
"3667760","3669680"," That's worth a five minute trade, right?"
"3670620","3672060"," So what do I want to see here?"
"3672160","3672680"," I haven't seen it."
"3672800","3673800"," Have I haven't seen a cross?"
"3674160","3675060"," Haven't seen nothing here."
"3675220","3678460"," So now now we need to get by this one right here. "
"3678560","3679720"," Now we need to get by."
"3679980","3681860"," If you're a bull, this works for bears too."
"3682580","3687440"," Now a bull needs to get by this one right here, right?"
"3688280","3690280"," You got that you failed this one back here. "
"3690340","3691480"," That tells you it's bearish."
"3691740","3693480"," You didn't get higher than this previous eyes."
"3693500","3695460"," That's bearish to come back down. "
"3695840","3700540"," So now bulls will get what not gonna get I think you're gonna go down but you're if you're a"
"3700540","3707060"," bull, you need to see a new high right here and then come back down over here and consolidate and"
"3707060","3710060"," then you'll see the move higher hopefully over here."
"3710640","3715320"," This if we go up there, you will actually take that trade there and be bullish."
"3717680","3719900"," You will then be bullish on this stock. "
"3720640","3723100"," Now this stuff I'm telling you right now, okay?"
"3723300","3724580"," I want to tell you guys something."
"3725420","3730200"," When you guys are out there asking somebody out in public or on social media, Hey, are you bullish"
"3730200","3730660"," on this?"
"3731180","3737840"," I guarantee you that 95 out of 100 people do not know what they're talking about."
"3737860","3739000"," There's about five. "
"3739720","3741460"," Five people, maybe 10."
"3741860","3744960"," Or maybe there's I'm being a little negative."
"3745420","3748240"," I'd say 30 out of 100 know"
"3748240","3758160"," if it's probably 20 of them"
"3758160","3760540"," are even though they know they don't know how to trade it. "
"3761220","3766940"," So you might your job here is to learn to to know what's bullish, what's bearish, when is it good,"
"3767160","3772580"," when is the term coming, when is it gonna directionally go and how long it's gonna go or the price"
"3772580","3778500"," that's the target for it to go and when to pull yourself, manage that trade and exit that trade."
"3779220","3780680"," Start that trade exit that trade."
"3782560","3783040"," That's right. "
"3783360","3787900"," Helene, I said how on it's Helene, Helene Meisler, I'm mispronouncing her name right now, but she's"
"3787900","3788340"," fucking awesome."
"3788340","3789480"," I think she's beautiful to do by the way."
"3789840","3795260"," I have a secret crush on I have a secret crush on her and my lady, my lady friend back"
"3795260","3797740"," here if you can't see her from seeing my CNBC host. "
"3798580","3802160"," But anyways, all the ranting is over on that stuff."
"3802540","3806300"," Now we're gonna talk about the we're gonna talk about the JPM caller really quick."
"3807540","3813600"," And because I said some things on Twitter yesterday that I did that I said on stream but didn't"
"3813600","3818260"," clarify 100% on Twitter, we're gonna we're gonna just clarify it for everybody out there. "
"3818320","3822920"," There's a lot of people out there in Twitter that have no idea how a caller works."
"3823720","3827280"," And we're gonna let me say they could well I should have saved that oopsie."
"3828860","3829640"," We're gonna go over here. "
"3829760","3833440"," We're gonna talk caller here."
"3834960","3839840"," And let me brief on this and dumb this down as as as as as much as possible here."
"3842870","3847970"," Now this the JPM caller right is a bearish seagull. "
"3848150","3852150"," It's not the best way to hedge your portfolio, but it is how a lot of banks do it."
"3852390","3853430"," They've always done it."
"3853510","3854390"," It's always worked for them. "
"3854390","3855290"," It's what they use."
"3855950","3858310"," But then you have retailers that follow it."
"3858310","3860090"," You have small funds that follow it. "
"3860290","3864350"," You have the effect of all of these people following it, watching it."
"3864690","3870150"," That makes it count even if this is so JPM has three callers that they run over a course of"
"3870150","3870450"," a quarter."
"3870770","3873770"," Now it doesn't matter how small it is. "
"3873790","3880450"," It matters that the market actually follows it and will trade it with trade it with JPM."
"3880930","3883150"," So there is an actually a large effect on it."
"3883370","3885850"," Now you might be asking why do they place this trade?"
"3886630","3892550"," They place the trade on a basic level to pay for positioning in the market and to protect"
"3892550","3893390"," themselves, right?"
"3893530","3898850"," They can protect the upside move or a or downside move with a bear seagull. "
"3899150","3903150"," Regardless of direction, they will pay for both sides of that trade."
"3903710","3904310"," The second"
"3904310","3915830"," reason"
"3915830","3923670"," that you will see people out there say to you that you should be that you should be we're gonna"
"3923670","3924810"," get a bloodbath here, by the way."
"3925510","3929210"," You'll see people out there tell you that we should have real price discovery. "
"3930070","3936250"," If we had real price discovery in our market, we would be like Liberia or like Liberia."
"3936350","3939490"," You would see our market go fucking wild."
"3940230","3945930"," And I mean like like wild swings up and down if these hedges were not put on the marketplace. "
"3947010","3953650"," If I was to simplify that concept to you, they would be like 10 of us having one stock of"
"3953650","3953910"," Tesla."
"3955030","3958590"," And of the 10 of us, we all have a different amount of money."
"3959070","3960810"," Some of us are poor and some of us are rich. "
"3961850","3967990"," It would have the trading of that stock would eventually devolve to only one person being able to"
"3967990","3970430"," own that stock because they had all the money."
"3971370","3977170"," So what what these banks do is what and what these banks don't want to do is they don't want"
"3977170","3980290"," to see like Spygo."
"3980550","3990250"," They don't want to see Spygo like this over the course of a year like moon straight up and then"
"3990250","3993230"," bam straight down over the course of a year, right?"
"3994450","4001950"," And then go out there and try to sell a product to people whether it be a 401k, right?"
"4002110","4009330"," A 401k or a pension or you're just putting your money with them to manage. "
"4010030","4015270"," Can you imagine your your financial advisor coming to you and being like, I'm going to put you in"
"4015270","4019170"," this program and you're going to have one big payout here and one big payout there."
"4019630","4027150"," No, these banks want to see the market go just like this, right?"
"4027670","4028350"," Let me clear all this."
"4029270","4035690"," These these banks want to see the market go just like this slow and steady to the right and you"
"4035690","4041450"," might get one bad dip and you might get one big rip but they want to be able to sell"
"4041450","4047310"," a product that says, look, look guy, I've got steady returns for you month over month and year over"
"4047310","4048910"," year, right?"
"4049130","4055850"," And they can sell these products to Bob and Mary on Main Street by trying to limit the upside"
"4055850","4058470"," volatility and limit the downside volatility. "
"4058950","4060110"," Now, does that always work?"
"4060410","4063090"," No, it doesn't always work, but it works a lot."
"4063770","4068590"," Now, if you're looking at this, if you're looking at this caller for right now for this month,"
"4068890","4068990"," right?"
"4070090","4077990"," Some of the effects of this caller is by limiting that downside momentum is you'll have magnets."
"4078530","4081470"," If we start to trade below, right, we'll pull down. "
"4081870","4089910"," Once we tag, we'll actually repel off that strike and actually push higher into this strike above."
"4090530","4096410"," If the market goes crazy and starts to squeeze us up, guess what this acts like?"
"4096710","4103410"," A magnet again, any going up will return back down to this strike over time."
"4104090","4108689"," Okay, if we were to break down over here, as a matter of fact, we're coming in the end of"
"4108689","4109430"," our quarter, right?"
"4110830","4115430"," We're coming into the end of this down for the month of December. "
"4116609","4123069"," It would act as a magnet and want to drag us back up into the end of quarter to this"
"4123069","4124149"," 4515."
"4124910","4134210"," Had we started to sell the market this quarter, and we blasted down below the 34020, guess what"
"4134210","4134649"," would happen?"
"4135250","4137649"," Or likelihood would happen into the end of the quarter."
"4137830","4141510"," We would slam back up into this strike over here. "
"4142050","4145430"," So that means that the strikes are dynamic."
"4146890","4150149"," Okay, they can be like a they can attract and they can repel."
"4150290","4160250"," And also, also, it leaves prices free to do what it wants, but has some pulling and or that's a"
"4160250","4161010"," bad example. "
"4162029","4168410"," Has some pulling effect and some some repelling effect if we don't get above it, believe it or not,"
"4168490","4171710"," but if we get above it, there's a high chance we can squeeze it and then come back down."
"4175270","4177930"," Not guaranteed to be perfect, but let's look at it."
"4178729","4180649"," Let's take a look at some prior examples. "
"4181770","4183390"," We broke down here, right?"
"4183670","4186149"," Bloodbath and into the end of quarter, right?"
"4186270","4189390"," You probably had sellers down here saying it's going to get really bad."
"4190830","4193430"," And there's a guy like Andy constant out there."
"4193490","4195450"," And he's like, Oh, fuck no, we're too close to the quarter. "
"4195930","4197410"," And it comes right back up."
"4197550","4197890"," Makes sense."
"4198810","4199090"," Right?"
"4199510","4202970"," We blast up here fail to get a new high and start blasting down here. "
"4203190","4203870"," But where do we stop?"
"4204530","4206830"," Right on one of the strikes in the caller, right?"
"4207610","4208650"," Same thing over here."
"4208650","4213570"," So let's look back to let's look on this on this quarter's caller right now."
"4214110","4219710"," We know on, we know that we have Jerome Powell on the 11th and 12th, right?"
"4224380","4227760"," So there's, there's the, there's the decision. "
"4230190","4232390"," We know that's the major volatility, right?"
"4237180","4242680"," And let's say we come into, let's just say we come into Jerome Powell on the 12th, right?"
"4243480","4246460"," And Jerome Powell tells us a 50 BPS fuck you."
"4246860","4248940"," And we blast down here, right?"
"4249800","4253540"," And let's say we start blasting down and we get to like close to the end of the end of"
"4253540","4254260"," the month and in the quarter."
"4254740","4256080"," What do you think is going to happen?"
"4256820","4257560"," High probability. "
"4257920","4259660"," We, we, we come right back up here."
"4259920","4264180"," If we blast down here into end of quarter, where do we likely go on all the way down here"
"4264180","4264800"," and end of quarter?"
"4264880","4266560"," Makes sense as we get closer."
"4267400","4272600"," So let's say, let's say Jerome Powell tells you when the 11th and 12th, no rate hikes and we're"
"4272600","4273580"," likely done raising. "
"4274060","4275120"," What do you think's going to happen?"
"4275300","4276380"," We blast up, right?"
"4276580","4276620"," Whoo."
"4277360","4278160"," Go to the moon."
"4278640","4279460"," What do you think happens?"
"4279760","4285780"," You're going to have a bull telling you we're going up and up and up cap, probably not in December. "
"4286120","4290660"," You're probably going to see us blast straight back down into this 45 15."
"4291360","4296840"," So when Andy Constance out there telling you 45 15 45 15, it's like a vortex, right?"
"4297180","4302440"," It is going, if we stay up here, if we stay up here into end of quarter, what's it going"
"4302440","4302760"," to do?"
"4303060","4303900"," Suck us back down."
"4304280","4308260"," If we blast down, what's going to happen as we get closer to the end of quarter?"
"4308700","4309760"," Suck us back up. "
"4309960","4311400"," If we're down here, what is it going to likely do?"
"4311800","4313240"," Drag us down into that quarter."
"4313480","4320440"," So as we come into the end of quarter of this year in 2024, we can probably posit the last"
"4320440","4326360"," week or two where we're headed in a very high probability of where we're headed."
"4326360","4330580"," So if you're out there and you're like, I never win a trade gap, as we get closer to the"
"4330580","4337060"," end of quarter, last week or two, depending upon where price is, we can probably figure out if"
"4337060","4339260"," we're heading up or down into that quarter. "
"4340700","4341680"," Makes sense to you."
"4342620","4343260"," Look at that."
"4343360","4344880"," Look at that blood rate known on spy. "
"4345660","4347080"," It's about to blood bath right now."
"4349640","4351340"," It's about to blood bath right now."
"4360490","4362370"," So should I have taken a call earlier?"
"4364110","4365770"," Did I have taken a call earlier?"
"4369240","4370940"," Did you get the new high right here?"
"4371920","4373040"," This is your previous high. "
"4373440","4374500"," Did you get the new high right here?"
"4376720","4377140"," No."
"4377140","4378380"," What does that show you?"
"4379220","4380940"," No will from buyers."
"4381520","4384180"," When you have no will from buyers, where are we going?"
"4385000","4387000"," We're going to go down right here and retest that low. "
"4387940","4392340"," We're going to come down here, bam, bam, bam, bam, likely go right there and then blast down here"
"4392340","4393060"," to the depths of hell."
"4396020","4396500"," Watch it happen."
"4396660","4397800"," I'll show it to you happen right now. "
"4400040","4401340"," So this gap is gone, right?"
"4403800","4404780"," We're going to make this smaller."
"4406680","4410800"," And if you were at home, if I was like, when I traded home and you guys aren't with me,"
"4410800","4413040"," I'm not with you, this is what I do when I'm trading."
"4414680","4417080"," Bears want to get below this white line right here. "
"4417280","4421400"," So this move right now, they want, bears want to do this right here."
"4424230","4425130"," Sellers are sellers."
"4425590","4426090"," It's not bears. "
"4426830","4427650"," They want to do that."
"4430330","4432530"," You're going to see bulls panic."
"4433970","4434910"," And they're right here. "
"4435010","4438750"," They're going to panic and then you're going to see a fucking bloodbath to the depths of hell down"
"4438750","4439050"," here."
"4439910","4443210"," Big moves to the downside."
"4446750","4448570"," What else can I see here?"
"4449470","4449490"," Right?"
"4449990","4452550"," Let's say the bears fail to get a new low. "
"4453210","4455750"," Let's say they come down here and they don't get the new low, right?"
"4455910","4457170"," They fail to get it, right?"
"4457870","4459010"," And we start to come higher."
"4460130","4461210"," Let's say you're short right now."
"4461750","4463030"," We start to bounce here. "
"4463130","4464550"," We don't actually start coming back up."
"4464770","4466230"," What would that do to you?"
"4467130","4468490"," You're scared now, right?"
"4468750","4469530"," You're short up here."
"4470370","4471750"," Your stops are right here. "
"4472610","4474170"," And we start to come back up."
"4474290","4476550"," What's the likelihood of what's going to happen, right?"
"4476690","4484960"," We're going to blast back up here, come back down here, and they're just going to start destroying"
"4484960","4486580"," your position, right?"
"4486820","4487920"," That, that, that, that, that, that."
"4488320","4489700"," And do you have a trade in here?"
"4489920","4490260"," Fuck no. "
"4490360","4492600"," This means you get out of your trade short or long."
"4492600","4497780"," And you sit on your hands until it begins to break to the upside or begins to break down and"
"4497780","4502700"," you set, you set up yourself a call or a put or a short or a long on the market."
"4505110","4505430"," Let's watch. "
"4505630","4510750"," Let's watch the price action together right now so you guys can see this price action and see how"
"4510750","4511130"," it's moving."
"4513820","4517440"," Let's watch this price action together because this is going to do one of two things."
"4517560","4522220"," It's either going to start consolidating or it's going to start breaking down and it's going to get"
"4522220","4523040"," really nasty. "
"4526020","4530380"," Now, if it was me day trading this, that'd be puts, puts, puts, puts, puts, puts, puts, right?"
"4530840","4533340"," Take the money and run, get underneath here."
"4534060","4536120"," And then I'd, I'd set up more puts right there."
"4537140","4540200"," And I'd take that shit right down there and slam that bad boy down. "
"4540300","4540980"," Well, it wouldn't be right there."
"4541040","4548620"," It'd be, hold on, it'd be like bam, consolidate and then bam straight down there."
"4551550","4553130"," That's, I guess the conservative way. "
"4561740","4562800"," Why is that shit?"
"4566670","4567230"," All right."
"4573170","4576270"," I'll tell you what, man, you learned this shit right and you, you're a tessel bull."
"4576990","4579290"," You'll be one happy fucking tessel bull. "
"4579550","4581550"," Like one happy, happy, tessel bull."
"4586100","4587720"," I'm going to share the tool with you this week."
"4587840","4590280"," We're getting it on, it's going to be on the website this week. "
"4590520","4592780"," So I'll have it available to you this week."
"4594140","4598460"," I think we're running a bunch of tests this week to make sure we get like, like when we launched"
"4598460","4600960"," stuff to you guys, we did like a bunch of stuff in the background that's happened."
"4601160","4602100"," So we're testing it all. "
"4602160","4603880"," We tested last night and we're going to test it."
"4604140","4606080"," I believe today and tomorrow it's going to be ready to rock."
"4614650","4616930"," I'm going to slide this over right now so you can see it. "
"4624560","4626500"," Matter of fact, it's going to be on trading view."
"4626680","4631760"," So if you don't have a trading view account, you can, they have the deal of the year going on"
"4631760","4633360"," 70% off for the year."
"4633540","4634300"," It's dirt cheap. "
"4634700","4637340"," If you want the tool, you better be signing up for trading view."
"4637580","4641680"," There is a free version that will work on, but not for day trading because they have delayed data."
"4641900","4644240"," It'll work on swing trading just fine, even with the delay. "
"4652200","4653960"," New low on spoons just then."
"4655520","4656220"," New low."
"4657200","4658060"," That's bearish. "
"4658680","4660260"," If you don't know that already, it's bearish."
"4667450","4674170"," So for me, you don't need, you only need the basic paid level of trading view."
"4674570","4676950"," Mio, hold on a second. "
"4677130","4678430"," That's a good question."
"4679790","4680570"," Hold on a second here."
"4684840","4685440"," Hang tight. "
"4686820","4689880"," I built this thing so you didn't need the professional level."
"4690300","4691460"," So hang tight here."
"4696480","4697420"," Get started. "
"4701460","4705980"," The essential is plenty and they do provide some data."
"4706600","4711780"," They say that they offer you to buy data, but you only need the $5 data plan."
"4712160","4719360"," If you trade some small products like futures, I think stuff like that, you'll need to pay $5. "
"4719640","4723300"," If you're trading cash market though, that data on the essential plan is fine."
"4723780","4728960"," And if you're not day trading, you can get away with the free version of it, but you'll have a"
"4728960","4730760"," 15 minute delay or something like that."
"4730880","4736340"," But if you're planning a fucking, if you're planning a swing trade on a one hour time frame or a"
"4736340","4741020"," four hour or a daily time frame, you don't need to be looking at a fucking one minute bar. "
"4741280","4745180"," You need to be looking at 15 minute bars or hour bars or stuff like that."
"4747700","4754180"," You think that, hold on a second, I can usually get you guys a, let me say I can get"
"4754180","4754860"," you the sale price."
"4754860","4755840"," Let me say I can get you a sale. "
"4756100","4764020"," I've got a, by the way, if the sale is over, I have a 65 or 75% coupon and"
"4764020","4767220"," I'll find it and I'll post it on our website for you at some point."
"4768840","4772860"," I think I've got, I think it's not quite the 70, but I got the 65%."
"4772860","4778080"," I bet if you emailed them today, I bet if you were to send them an email today, right, and"
"4778080","4779420"," say, Hey, I missed your sale. "
"4779420","4780020"," Can I get it?"
"4780140","4781320"," I bet you they'll say yes to you."
"4781600","4783160"," I bet there's someone on the other end."
"4783160","4784500"," If you're nice to them, they'll give it to you. "
"4787340","4788980"," We had a nice bounce right there."
"4789260","4791240"," Let's see if that's actually bottom or not."
"4791940","4792640"," I think tighter. "
"4792800","4793020"," Let's see."
"4793160","4794260"," Nice V shape recovery."
"4795020","4796520"," Looks pretty good right there like that. "
"4798840","4800500"," Four, five, three, seven."
"4801180","4802180"," Nice bounce right there."
"4802180","4803080"," That might be bottom right there. "
"4804340","4805640"," We'll keep an eye out though."
"4805880","4807160"," So you set a nice V shape recovery."
"4807360","4810960"," If I was looking at just book map, right, this looks like bottom. "
"4812040","4813820"," I still wouldn't take that yet."
"4813840","4816520"," I would still want to see the back test."
"4816700","4822520"," I want to see a new high and this right here to take that trade right there and then this"
"4822520","4823160"," one to the upside. "
"4824240","4828600"," So for me personally, you might take this trade and say that's bottom cap that looks like the V"
"4828600","4830580"," shape recovery double bottom down here."
"4830760","4836020"," For me, I don't, that's not enough for me to believe that we're done going down here."
"4836260","4838640"," We can be, but I don't, I don't believe that we are. "
"4838800","4843880"," So, all right, not believe I have to follow my own trading plan and make sure that this is we"
"4843880","4844960"," are actually going up here."
"4850470","4856390"," Joey Donut just posted saying it's still going on."
"4856470","4861190"," He just posted a link to you for you in Twitch. "
"4861730","4862090"," Hold on here."
"4862770","4864350"," Let me see if I can catch that with you."
"4865890","4870210"," I'm going to post, Joey, you might have to post that link inside of the, I didn't know Joey was"
"4870210","4870430"," here. "
"4870830","4871350"," I love you, Joe."
"4872130","4878000"," Oh, no, it says it's gone."
"4878520","4880020"," Joe, I just clicked on it, man. "
"4880120","4880660"," It says it's gone."
"4881900","4882700"," Does it work for you, man?"
"4882820","4883640"," It's not working for me."
"4884800","4888140"," Let me see if it's working on an incognito level window. "
"4889140","4890860"," Oh, it says, see you next year."
"4891080","4892160"," I'll find one for you."
"4892320","4895220"," I have, I have a link that's like year round. "
"4895400","4897760"," It's like 65% off or something."
"4898920","4904040"," But I'll tell you, just send them an email, say, new, and I want to sign up."
"4905220","4906740"," You can use Captain Jim James too. "
"4909740","4913040"," I have an affiliate program there, but I don't care if you use my name or not."
"4913520","4915760"," I really don't, I really don't care if you use it or not."
"4918340","4921420"," Let me see if I can get a Captain Jim James affiliate link. "
"4921560","4921740"," Hold on."
"4926940","4928100"," I think I can get one."
"4937080","4939660"," They offered me to be a partner and I said, no. "
"4941760","4944440"," Here's a, I don't know if this will help you save any money."
"4944960","4949490"," You know what I would do is I would uh, this switch."
"4949750","4950770"," There's my affiliate link. "
"4953950","4960310"," You could just say, hey, Captain Jim James sent me here and say, well, say, can you please give me"
"4960310","4962890"," the 65% or 70% off Black Friday deal?"
"4964110","4966190"," Send an email, say, Captain Jim James sent me here."
"4966310","4967190"," Here's the affiliate link."
"4967870","4969250"," Is it possible to get that discount?"
"4969570","4970150"," See what they tell you. "
"4970470","4971510"," See if they say yes or not."
"4971710","4972990"," So people work with you sometimes."
"4973470","4974870"," If you, if you say a lot, I miss start. "
"4975190","4976290"," I didn't get paid or something."
"4976450","4977830"," I work a job at McDonald's."
"4977890","4978130"," I'm broke. "
"4978970","4979630"," I'm a new trader."
"4979810","4980430"," I'm a young guy."
"4982230","4983070"," Something like that. "
"4983850","4989390"," So this yellow bar right here, this is actually positive for bulls."
"4989650","4990390"," I like seeing this."
"4990570","4995710"," If you see this here, it has, it is actually getting bullish because we're heading down. "
"4995970","4997930"," See that red line flattening out a little bit."
"4998370","5000230"," See that white line flattening out a little bit."
"5000330","5002070"," Notice the white and red line how they're flattening. "
"5003010","5005450"," This is telling you were neutral right now."
"5006590","5007330"," See that right there?"
"5007890","5012310"," It's telling you they were neutral that those triggers are starting to flatten out."
"5013970","5016270"," So from bearish now to neutral. "
"5018290","5019710"," Let's see if we can get bullish here."
"5020030","5033380"," See if"
"5033380","5033580"," we can get bullish."
"5033720","5034340"," We have some calls there. "
"5034420","5034840"," We'll see what happens."
"5035140","5035660"," Now this is risk."
"5035840","5036620"," I shouldn't be doing this. "
"5039540","5040960"," They're sitting there 17 cents."
"5041200","5041420"," They're cheap."
"5041420","5046000"," So we'll see if we get the turn. "
"5046260","5047560"," No, no confirmation yet."
"5047620","5048660"," See how this looks like a turn?"
"5049320","5050860"," And they rolled it right back down."
"5051040","5051780"," Watch this right here. "
"5051800","5053560"," You don't want to see them roll this back down again."
"5072010","5074090"," I have a micro and alimony is due."
"5075990","5076390"," Yeah. "
"5078450","5079370"," What do you mail them?"
"5080290","5082490"," I would email them and say something to them."
"5084050","5084770"," All right."
"5087250","5088930"," What else we got for you guys today?"
"5090230","5090870"," All right. "

"5112470","5116850"," So if you want to check it out, our discord, my view, I've been a lot of discord."
"5117110","5118670"," This is my favorite discord out there."

"5121850","5123170"," So hold on one second here."

"5147640","5147940"," Good job. "
"5149000","5149680"," All right."
"5149900","5150140"," All right."
"5150280","5150460"," All right. "
"5151360","5151760"," Okay."
"5152040","5152400"," Tight here."
"5153860","5155300"," 140 in the afternoon. "
"5155980","5161780"," 3 p.m. We've got Tesla having their Cybertruck launched with Elon Musk."
"5165910","5167870"," I'm going to turn on a new squacker for you."
"5168710","5170330"," We'll have the new squacker in the background. "
"5174340","5178560"," For news today, well, we know that today is the last day of the month."
"5178580","5179320"," Excuse me."
"5179740","5188060"," We also know that we should begin to get bearish tomorrow or possibly Monday for the first couple"
"5188060","5188940"," weeks of December. "
"5189420","5190880"," I went over that with you guys yesterday."
"5194400","5195800"," We've got no more news today."
"5196020","5196240"," Tomorrow. "
"5196420","5198240"," We've got a fed supervisor bar."
"5198580","5203080"," Then we've got a PMI ISM manufacturing instruction spending in Guzleby."
"5203260","5220220"," I have the big one is going to be Jerome Powell at 11 and at 2 p.m. Tweezer. "
"5220320","5221380"," This is a tweezer right here."
"5223620","5227100"," Big, big fat green bar, big, fat red bar right there."
"5228100","5228820"," Tweezer reversal. "
"5229740","5232800"," You can Google search to go out and explain it better to you."
"5236120","5236640"," Reversals."
"5237040","5237960"," Downside and upside. "
"5242300","5243580"," Poke the juice box."
"5243840","5244340"," I love you brother."
"5245600","5247560"," I love you poke juice box. "
"5248980","5253760"," I love you Joey."
"5254160","5255480"," I love you too poke juice box."
"5287270","5288370"," Let's make some money. "
"5291960","5293160"," What up Dave Solani?"
"5293940","5294120"," Slanky."
"5294880","5295020"," Goliath."
"5295060","5295640"," How are you doing?"
"5295780","5296120"," Wookie rules. "
"5296420","5296660"," What's up?"
"5297560","5298000"," Tesla."
"5298340","5299860"," I've got Tesla on the chart right here."
"5299940","5300780"," This is Tesla. "
"5302320","5304680"," So here's Tesla right there."
"5306680","5308800"," Do you guys want to see Tesla closer?"
"5309060","5310900"," Do you see that zigzag line I got right there?"
"5312360","5313360"," See it right there?"
"5317320","5323760"," This right here on Tesla is the hourly trigger and this is the daily trigger down here."
"5325440","5328020"," So right now you're in no man's land on Tesla. "
"5328400","5330080"," No man's land on Tesla."
"5331180","5332600"," You're in no man's land."
"5333880","5335320"," You got nothing for Tesla. "
"5336700","5338380"," This is your daily trigger believe it or not."
"5338620","5339620"," I'll just put that right there."
"5342100","5343780"," This is your daily trigger on Tesla. "
"5344720","5346120"," Do you see a cross on Tesla?"
"5346240","5347480"," I just went over those all with you."
"5347940","5349220"," Do you guys see a cross on Tesla?"
"5349580","5350320"," Fuck no you don't."
"5351180","5352120"," No you don't. "
"5352940","5354800"," So there's no dip buy yet on Tesla."
"5355140","5356580"," I am watching Tesla today."
"5356880","5359880"," If Tesla begins to turn bullish again, I'll let you know. "
"5361320","5362640"," But not bullish yet."
"5363800","5364980"," So they're going to roll me here."
"5366540","5377380"," They're going to try to I'm"
"5377380","5379240"," going to try to bloodbath me down right there. "
"5382180","5386200"," I'm going to have to buy more calls in DCA going against my own advice."
"5389220","5415230"," Come on,"
"5415290","5415530"," quick second."
"5415710","5417090"," I got some stuff I got to do in the background here. "
"5417530","5419070"," I got a bunch of other monitors set up."
"5419090","5419490"," They're going to watch."
"5421920","5423500"," They're going to try to rain this down right now. "
"5423640","5424740"," Watch out to the downside here."
"5429610","5430970"," I think there's a big bloodbath coming."
"5449400","5450540"," Let me see what you guys are saying here. "
"5452760","5453900"," What do you guys got there?"
"5454760","5456200"," What's PT for Tesla?"
"5456620","5463960"," In my view, you're likely going to see Tesla get parked between 232 and 244."
"5464500","5468300"," Let's take a look at Tesla really quick on the trigger screen here."
"5468600","5469200"," Hold on a second here. "
"5488010","5488650"," Excuse me."
"5489450","5490590"," I'm losing my voice."
"5490770","5492230"," I've been losing my voice. "
"5492450","5499830"," I've been sick and then this looks nasty."
"5499830","5500610"," Hold on a second here."
"5501110","5502870"," I don't like the look of any of that. "
"5506110","5506810"," Looks sloppy."
"5507630","5509090"," I should have drew this nicer."
"5511550","5512470"," Here's a 30 minute. "
"5512710","5516410"," This was the original resistance right here."
"5522600","5524720"," So what do we know about Tesla right now?"
"5527340","5529660"," We know that this was the place to buy the dip."
"5529980","5530380"," We did. "
"5530860","5533200"," It's just starting to become bullish right now."
"5534200","5541160"," We also know that we have not seen the full weakness on Tesla yet on the hourly at least, right?"
"5541740","5543020"," So Tesla is still weak."
"5544320","5547020"," We also know that we got some demand up here, right?"
"5547380","5547380"," Demand. "
"5547960","5552040"," These are real buyers, not you the retailer, but real buyers, right?"
"5552320","5558340"," So we're going to expect something like this and we kind of know or making an assumption that"
"5558340","5560980"," there's more buyers here, here, and here."
"5561540","5565020"," So for today, what am I looking for to buy Tesla?"
"5567990","5569590"," I'm going to get stopped out here."
"5570490","5572550"," So what am I looking for for Tesla?"
"5573650","5577610"," I know that there's known buyers down here. "
"5577810","5587070"," So right now for price action's sake, I want to attempt to buy the dip down here, 232, 225"
"5587070","5588190"," right in there."
"5588290","5593030"," That's where I'm going to be a buy the dip, okay, on Tesla."
"5594090","5598870"," Now let's say Tesla doesn't blast down there, right?"
"5599910","5602130"," Let's say Tesla doesn't blast down there. "
"5602610","5604430"," I'm going to go to a one minute chart here."
"5605610","5608550"," Let's say Tesla doesn't blast down there."
"5609130","5612330"," Then I have to be more precise, right?"
"5612970","5614890"," Or tactful in trading Tesla. "
"5615850","5617950"," So I would need to see Tesla reverse."
"5620090","5622330"," I'm going to get, I'm going to get eaten up here."
"5622950","5629450"," Alright, I would need to see Tesla reverse course, slam back down, and then I could probably take"
"5629450","5636230"," that trade right there to the hourly trigger, but I'm still not bullish on Tesla until it gets"
"5636230","5640790"," above the hourly trigger and begins to trend higher again. "
"5641190","5643610"," Right now, Tesla is bearish."
"5644130","5645930"," It is bearish right now."
"5646210","5648290"," Whether you like that or not, that is what it is. "
"5648470","5649390"," It is bearish."
"5650150","5653810"," And it's looking to come down and test this daily trigger right here."
"5654230","5660930"," So as of right now, Tesla is on track to trade 232, 232 67. "
"5665990","5666910"," Pretty cool, right?"
"5671000","5672340"," I know you don't want to hear that."
"5673060","5682080"," If you're wondering for me what I think about Tesla, hold on one second here, if you're wondering"
"5682080","5691780"," from my perspective about Tesla, what I think about Tesla is I think you're going to get"
"5691780","5692160"," trapped."
"5693160","5699280"," I think they're going to trap you in Tesla between that 232 and the 244. "
"5700460","5705480"," I think the dealers are going to allow you to trade this up and down in that box."
"5706200","5709940"," I think you see the real move after the next expiry."
"5736150","5741830"," So December 8th, and to be honest with you, if you really are a Tesla bull because of market"
"5742910","5746050"," expectations next week, I'm going to expect the market to be weak. "
"5746230","5750230"," I'm expecting the market to be weak next week and possibly even into like 12th."
"5751450","5754130"," So I'll be looking for like December 30th."
"5754570","5761850"," If you're going to do options December 30th and into some weakness into these next two weeks to"
"5761850","5766390"," take that trade, that's what I think is going to happen with Tesla. "
"5766690","5773570"," I think Tesla is going to, I think whatever Tesla does today will be quickly sold off and the"
"5775710","5782170"," profits will be taken and dealers are going to sweep up after you and then they're going to come"
"5782170","5784530"," back and deal with it later if it's bullish or bearish."
"5796680","5802800"," So if you're asking me what I think about Tesla event today, I'm going to tell you a few things."
"5804400","5808500"," You've got sellers and buyers on this event, right?"
"5809780","5815960"," The dealers are likely going to want to swing down for the expected move on this strike. "
"5816620","5818080"," I'm going to show you the expected move here too."
"5818200","5818400"," Hold on."
"5818700","5819840"," You guys want to expect to move today?"
"5819980","5820720"," I'll give you that too. "
"5825690","5826330"," Hang tight one second."
"5826470","5827210"," I'll give it to you right now."
"5830780","5831480"," Give me one quick second. "
"5831640","5833000"," I'll give you the expected move today on Tesla."
"5838470","5839490"," For this event."
"5840310","5842930"," For the next strikes, I'll give you all the expected moves. "
"5843430","5846650"," So, hang tight one second here."
"5854100","5861040"," So for this upcoming strike, there's an expectation that we trade, guess what?"
"5861760","5862140"," Take a guess."
"5863360","5865260"," 232 and 244. "
"5866720","5868720"," Dealers, where are we at right now?"
"5869840","5870220"," We're at 238."
"5871420","5876960"," So dealers are likely going to wind up doing what?"
"5877560","5885460"," Trading, if nothing big is announced, you're going to see us trade this range on this green bar up"
"5885460","5888240"," here and this yellow bar down there."
"5888680","5894260"," This is your expected range on Tesla today on this expiry. "
"5894860","5902820"," I told you I expected the first two the next thing."
"5902980","5903460"," You ready for this?"
"5904340","5910600"," On the 15th, there's an expectation that Tesla will trade 222 or 253."
"5911800","5916800"," So, if you're going to buy a call spread on Tesla, make sure that your call spread can take into"
"5916800","5922520"," account a swing load to 222 on Tesla. "
"5923540","5933400"," Also today, if Tesla does not have any major news positive or or negative, you're going to see"
"5933400","5933880"," dealers."
"5934440","5942580"," You're not going to, you're not going to see buyers or sellers step in and mass or I should, let"
"5942580","5943260"," me rephrase that."
"5943380","5949180"," You're not going to see, let's say they come up saying to their their event today, right?"
"5949400","5951460"," And you don't see anything come out that's unknown. "
"5953020","5957880"," You're not going to see buyers show up out of excitement tomorrow for options."
"5958460","5961120"," If that happens, you're going to see major IV crush."
"5961760","5967400"," You'll see sellers step in to capitalize on that and you'll see Tesla bloodbath, right?"
"5968500","5976520"," So, if you're, if you're a Tesla bull in into this event, you're hoping that some news, some"
"5976520","5978160"," unknown news comes out. "
"5978160","5986400"," Just a correction from the wires, Iraq voluntarily cut oil output by 220,000 barrels today, not 211 "
"5986400","5988100",",000 in the first quarter."
"5990660","5992560"," Does that make sense to you?"
"5992740","5997200"," So, you're, if you're a bull, like, hey, I'm going to buy a bunch of zero dates or whatever, one"
"5997200","6003600"," dates or whatever for the first, you better be knowing that it's a full lot of trade."
"6003820","6007180"," You're betting on some unknown news being released today. "
"6007600","6014720"," That will trigger massive buying, not only after or during the events, but follow through buying"
"6014720","6015100"," tomorrow."
"6016240","6022420"," You need, if you're a bull here coming into this close today on Tesla, you need to see, even if"
"6022420","6027460"," it's positive, it has to be something that's unknown to the market, right?"
"6027760","6035100"," If you don't see that where it compels people to buy options tomorrow, like, but yeah, crazy shit's"
"6035100","6035420"," happening."
"6035780","6040160"," Elon said something that nobody knows, and it's going to bring us, you know, billions of dollars"
"6040160","6043600"," and up billions, but you know, millions of dollars, this, that, and the other thing, you won't see"
"6043600","6051040"," that move likely take place permanently that pays you options for the next, at least one, if not"
"6051040","6053060"," two or three strikes due to market conditions. "
"6055040","6057040"," So be aware of that, if you're a bull."
"6058460","6063240"," Now, if you're going to buy the underlying for that, or if you bought, if you buy the underlying, I"
"6063240","6068700"," would still recommend taking the money and running on any squeezes after the bell today on the"
"6068700","6074620"," underlying, about before 9 p.m. or before 6 a.m. unless they tell you something."
"6075620","6081580"," Another cool trade for this event would be a fly selling, selling calls and puts both sides. "
"6082100","6086380"," Sell OTM calls and puts them both sides, and you walk away with that premium."
"6086820","6087740"," The best way to trade that event."
"6092450","6097610"," It's not just the bears though, it's the dealers, the dealers, like, if I'm a dealer, right, I want"
"6097610","6101670"," you to get all bold up and I'll bear it up, and then I want to take all of your"
"6101670","6105110"," money, the bear money and the bull money, I want to take all of it from you. "
"6105990","6110270"," And I don't want to be, and if I get forced into chasing, I will, but if I'm not forced"
"6110270","6115430"," into chasing, I'm going to sweep up after the event and say, fuck you, we'll come back in the next"
"6115430","6118730"," expiry and we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll deal with it up or down then."
"6131860","6132300"," Yep."
"6132300","6138440"," I'm watching Tesla right now, Tesla just just commented, here's Tesla, you want to see Tesla do"
"6138440","6139240"," what right now?"
"6140380","6144600"," You want, so this is a Tesla chart down here, you want to see Tesla do what right now Tesla"
"6144600","6150340"," just, you know, Tesla just want, you want to see Tesla do what right now to get bold up. "
"6151200","6156560"," You want to see a squeeze up, got a new high, you want to get higher than 240, 160, come"
"6156560","6161820"," back down, right, get that cross going on the one in five, one in five minutes, start taking this"
"6161820","6165280"," up, right, start getting bold up right about there."
"6166160","6170320"," I think they might pin you here, looking at the options market, I think they're going to try to pin"
"6170320","6173860"," you here, or at least on top, I'm not sure, but I think they're going to try to."
"6174440","6178000"," If the price action tells us something different, we'll take the long. "
"6179560","6184980"," You got a break above the one minute right now on Tesla, needs to break above the five minute,"
"6185300","6201750"," currently trading 238.93. Give"
"6201750","6203050"," me one quick second here."
"6203750","6208770"," I have to set up the, the Cybertruck event in the background so we can watch that."
"6209170","6212110"," I'm going to have the event on the screen full screen. "
"6212330","6216710"," You're going to have me on a small, I'll be in a small picture and picture kind of a thing."
"6217290","6218310"," So I'll be taking up the screen."
"6218490","6219730"," You guys can watch Tesla. "
"6219930","6225630"," You're going to get reaction from me on the event and hopefully I have a guest coming."
"6225630","6232550"," He may not be able to be here on video, but I think I have a Tesla bull that is"
"6233870","6241150"," objective and I know that he's an objective Tesla bull and he tells it how it is and he gets"
"6241150","6243570"," down into the nitty-gritty and the granularness of Tesla."
"6243890","6247950"," So I don't know if he's coming on the show right now, but let me text him right now and"
"6247950","6248670"," see if he's available. "
"6249310","6259020"," So I'm going to have two, myself and a Tesla and a Tesla"
"6259020","6265660"," bull, but I don't pay attention as close as a lot of other people do because I lost a lot"
"6265660","6266360"," of money doing that."
"6266940","6291430"," So now I keep it pretty fucking, I'm a sociopath when it I'm"
"6291430","6293790"," going to check with him right now and see if he'll be with us on the show."
"6294090","6295770"," I'm going to set this event up in the background. "
"6298010","6299090"," Still long calls here."
"6299870","6304290"," The dealer is telling you we're not going to 455 right now."
"6304830","6307310"," Dude, there's a chance here we park this for the rest of the day. "
"6308010","6309110"," It's 2 p.m. right now."
"6309170","6310290"," I want you to be aware of something."
"6310790","6317810"," There's a very high probability that we're going to do this all day long on 455 into the actual"
"6317810","6318070"," close. "
"6318470","6319450"," Not guaranteed, but it's possible."
"6320510","6323150"," I'm looking right now at 455 C's."
"6323290","6323990"," They're 11 cents. "
"6325510","6333210"," Dealers are not pricing in a move to 460 or 456 or 457 or 460 right now."
"6333370","6335850"," So now there is a bunch of SPX."
"6336910","6343630"," There's a shit ton of SPX calls out there for 460 expiring today, a ton of them. "
"6344050","6348070"," So we'll see if they squeeze it up and we can capture that money if we can't, we can't."
"6348070","6351830"," So I'm in a bunch of a bunch of these calls right now."
"6352250","6353350"," We'll see what it does. "
"6354930","6360710"," We'll see if we can get the ramp into the close and they've invariably killed a bunch of those"
"6360710","6362730"," fours, 46 hundreds at this point."
"6362910","6366750"," So I'm just don't get on a four."
"6366910","6368670"," Don't get on 460 whatever you do. "
"6393630","6395130"," I have not sold my calls."
"6395550","6400970"," If you're just joining this program, if I buy calls, puts, I make my fucking damn just watch out"
"6400970","6403890"," for this rejection up here and see that white bar kicking up right there."
"6404610","6405770"," That's this one right here. "
"6406490","6407790"," It's now moved down."
"6407950","6408690"," It's like right there."
"6412300","6425150"," That yellow, I should"
"6425150","6427630"," you can't see it, but it's on it's there on book mouth. "
"6427810","6429790"," There's a there's there's resistance right there."
"6435670","6436890"," I want to get above."
"6439710","6444090"," I want to see that green stick its face out right above that white box if possible. "
"6463240","6466820"," I'm just fucking guys still trying to fucking stop us from going up."
"6481910","6483270"," Goddamn going to tell you something, man."
"6483690","6485950"," You're going to I want you guys all to know this, okay?"
"6487190","6489910"," The highest probability trade. "
"6490010","6497070"," Listen closely, the highest probability trade, the most probable trade from tomorrow into the rate"
"6497070","6506830"," decision is a consolidation trade that will likely turn into distribution into the Jerome"
"6506830","6507230"," event."
"6507230","6514970"," The probable trade is going to be sideways and not no bloodbath until we get right on the 12th,"
"6514970","6515870"," 11th and 12th."
"6516070","6522670"," So if you're a bear, right, you're going to expect dips to be bought and rips to be sold, dips"
"6522670","6531150"," to be bought, rips to be sold and like a slow, a slow, orderly staircase down into the 11th or"
"6531150","6532850"," until I'm probably like the eighth or 10th or something. "
"6533530","6535390"," And then I've been a bloodbath down on the 11th 12th."
"6535410","6537750"," That's the most probable trade that we have ahead of us."
"6538390","6542110"," Don't be listening to like the fucking Fed speakers out there. "
"6542450","6547290"," Don't be listening to fucking don't be listening to the fucking CNBC and Bloomberg and all this"
"6547290","6547730"," other shit."
"6548910","6552190"," We you and I go over all this stuff every week, right?"
"6552330","6555990"," We go over the macro stuff, we go over the price action, we go over all this stuff."
"6557070","6564830"," So you have a high probability, high likelihood of the market being free tomorrow to start to head"
"6564830","6565870"," lower and consolidate. "
"6566670","6573550"," Now that bloodbath into the 11th 12th, I would not be expecting like fucking 4,400 or something"
"6573550","6574030"," like that."
"6574330","6577750"," I'm not expecting that bloodbath into the 11th 12th."
"6577750","6582770"," Now on the on the 11th 12th when we get the decision, you can see that 440 on that rate"
"6582770","6583170"," decision. "
"6584110","6586210"," But you're not going to see it like tomorrow."
"6586670","6591490"," You're high probably that you don't see it tomorrow that you don't see it on Friday that you don't"
"6591490","6592210"," see it on Monday."
"6593130","6599910"," Limit your limit your downside expectations until we get into the 8th and 10th and 12th. "
"6600230","6603090"," And you're and you're likely going to need Jerome to send it lower."
"6605010","6614880"," Yeah, if you get puts,"
"6615160","6617980"," right, just like Rod Dog puts, I'm going to tell you a couple of things here, okay?"
"6619360","6622080"," Your best trade is likely going to be not puts, right?"
"6622180","6628040"," It's going to be a put ratio spread, put back spreads are also always known also known as you get"
"6628040","6629100"," yourself a put back spread."
"6629500","6632980"," You date them for the 30th 31st. "
"6633380","6636580"," You shut them off at you shut them off on the 12th."
"6636580","6640340"," If you get the bloodbath down on the 12th or something like that, we bloodbath it down."
"6640360","6641200"," You take the money and run. "
"6641460","6645960"," If you get a decision against you where we market rips to the upside, you're going to be covered."
"6646060","6649240"," It's a perfect fucking trade for the rate decision."
"6649900","6654380"," Perfect fucking trade of put back spread, put ratio spread. "
"6655200","6658860"," That's when you're, anyways, if you don't know what those are, then you shouldn't even be fucking"
"6658860","6660620"," trading that that event."
"6660620","6669060"," But what else would work for you would be put up to put spread, just the put spread like a"
"6669060","6675880"," not a credit spread, but like, yeah, I guess you could use a credit spread too."
"6675980","6678180"," You get the velocity at the end of that trade. "
"6681830","6683430"," Still long calls here, by the way."
"6683430","6685330"," I want to see that new high."
"6686030","6688450"," You'll likely see this sell off. "
"6688450","6692290"," If we get the new high as soon as we go up, whoop, we're going to come right back down"
"6692290","6692530"," again."
"6693030","6694330"," And then we'll start doing that shit."
"6699240","6701240"," Your next target after the top of this. "
"6701300","6702720"," So your PT one's up here."
"6703560","6713470"," You got one PT one right"
"6713470","6713730"," here."
"6714550","6719270"," And then your next PT is going to be right here. "
"6721620","6733650"," Two four fifty"
"6733650","6734910"," five seventy two."
"6747200","6748220"," Take tighter guess."
"6754230","6754970"," Excuse me. "
"6764280","6765260"," PT three."
"6772640","6774000"," PT four right there."
"6781480","6784700"," If we go all the way to PT four, it would look like this. "
"6801560","6803080"," Oh, whoa, whoa."
"6804900","6806100"," What are you doing right there?"
"6809520","6810600"," Something like that."
"6833980","6837600"," Also note that we've reversal that's checking right now on Tesla. "
"6838100","6842100"," Tesla beginning to turn around and it's one minute looking pretty bullish."
"6843440","6849360"," Your first target to the upside on Tesla is going to be two thirty nine ninety two, then two forty."
"6865560","6866600"," Look at that, hold on a second. "
"6901440","6903520"," There's the setup down below if you want to see it."
"6904020","6905500"," This is your Tesla setup right here."
"6932110","6934630"," You guys are making money right now in those calls, right?"
"6935630","6936630"," Say yes, Captain. "
"6936730","6937230"," I'm making money."
"6938070","6939110"," Say yes, Captain."
"6939270","6939710"," I'm making money. "
"6941810","6942930"," Say it to me in the chat."
"6943490","6944470"," Say I'm making money, Captain."
"6951200","6952540"," Do I think what?"
"6953640","6956660"," Do I think dealer's M's like when retailers sell options?"
"6957660","6965120"," I think it's just a normal function of, I think it's a normal function of protecting yourself. "
"6965460","6970380"," You own the underlying, it's a normal function of the market to protect yourself."
"6973510","6974070"," Right on, right?"
"6974190","6974990"," Good job, Tesla Jess."
"6982430","6984570"," You guys are just, you guys aren't following me on trades. "
"6984750","6985110"," Good job."
"6988540","6990060"," You guys are managing your own risk."
"6990160","6990520"," I like that. "
"6990720","6990920"," Good job."
"6991080","6991840"," Who said he didn't do that?"
"6992100","6992600"," Daniel, good job."
"6993120","6993760"," Good job, Daniel. "
"6993880","6995180"," Man, manage your own trade."
"7000440","7001080"," Good job, Daniel."
"7002300","7004320"," Daniel's the only one here not following Captain's trades. "
"7004540","7005160"," I like that, Daniel."
"7007300","7009040"," Daniel, I'm going to tell you something here, okay?"
"7010000","7011180"," See that cross right there?"
"7011300","7013060"," This is a bull cross right here, bull playing."
"7014720","7017980"," If you get a successful retest of this one, we're going to moon, bro. "
"7018600","7019500"," We're going to moon straight up there."
"7020060","7021800"," This is where you're going to take a trade right here, brother."
"7022840","7023940"," You're going to see a flip. "
"7026740","7027820"," You're going to see a flip."
"7028040","7031560"," This, this red is going to turn green in just a minute here, or it should."
"7032260","7037600"," It might not because of this green up here, this hourly, I think it might not turn green because we"
"7037600","7039640"," are below the hourly trigger right now. "
"7044470","7047110"," I don't think this will turn green until we get above the hourly trigger."
"7047270","7048370"," I forget how you did the math on this."
"7051290","7056190"," I want you guys to be like, I want you guys to take your time here, but this should be"
"7056190","7057130"," a quick five minute trade. "
"7057270","7059630"," This is a quick bullish five minute trade to the upside."
"7060830","7070820"," Price target, upside price target, $454.92. $454.92. See if we can"
"7070820","7071220"," get it here."
"7080310","7081470"," Right there's your first target. "
"7091190","7092070"," Right on, Steven."
"7097450","7099770"," I'm going to warn you guys of something here, okay?"
"7099890","7100770"," I'm going to tell you guys something."
"7102110","7106830"," Right now, dude, the next two weeks is not guaranteed, but there's a high probability. "
"7107750","7114010"," Historically, a high probability of a couple down weeks starting tomorrow, though we are at the end"
"7114010","7115350"," of the week, so it could be Monday."
"7116090","7122030"," Could be bullish into Friday, but just be aware that I don't say I didn't tell you."
"7123090","7128150"," Don't say I didn't tell you that starting tomorrow or traditionally starting tomorrow. "
"7130490","7134750"," We're in minimum consolidation mode starting tomorrow."
"7135270","7139310"," I think until like the I think it's the 12th to 15th somewhere in there."
"7142950","7148390"," I'm going to be taking my money right there if we get up there. "

"7233060","7236880"," I don't tell people that either."
"7237180","7239340"," If I meet somebody, I normally don't tell them anything. "
"7240660","7241760"," What do you do for a job?"
"7241980","7246760"," My job is to try to make money with other people in the stock market."
"7254960","7256100"," I love you too, Steven."

"7328000","7329740"," Reach and fold the stars."
"7332040","7333900"," I wonder where you are."
"7364360","7367820"," All right. "
"7367940","7369100"," So you beat this PT here."
"7369600","7370660"," Going to get rid of that."
"7370660","7371240"," You could leave. "
"7371420","7377480"," If you wanted to leave this on, what you could do over here is you beat this one right."

"7380300","7384880"," And you're going to look for this white line right here to come up here. "
"7385020","7385280"," Aren't you?"
"7385580","7388920"," Come back down here and then bam right there."

"7396520","7400060"," I'm an eternal optimist. "
"7400360","7405740"," I don't mind selling the market but now you might get a little bit of liquidation breakdown here."
"7405880","7406360"," Watch out for this."
"7406460","7409420"," You got this coming down right here and then that move right there. "
"7410320","7411880"," I'm going to turn a lot optimist."

"7428160","7430580"," It's like let's sell that shit into the fucking dumpster. "
"7433100","7436180"," Like if I hate a company like I understand you guys hate some companies."
"7436980","7439760"," Some of you hate Tesla, right?"
"7439760","7444780"," So but uh if I hate a company I understand wanting to sell the fuck out of it to the"
"7444780","7445260"," depths of hell."
"7445400","7449540"," You guys are we sell Pete on down like a temp to sell Pete on down in the depths of"
"7449540","7449720"," hell. "
"7460810","7461630"," You're a machinist."
"7461830","7462870"," You tell people that you work it out."
"7462950","7463730"," Be used to avoid conversation. "
"7464550","7466210"," Yeah, I don't tell too many people."
"7467410","7470430"," Only if I really really know you and I don't want you to judge me."
"7471250","7472290"," I won't tell people. "
"7473230","7473790"," All right."
"7473870","7476450"," So you're looking for any kind of retest."
"7477130","7478030"," That's successful. "
"7479890","7482210"," Oh the this the next thing I want to show you."
"7482330","7485050"," Let's say we let's say pull back here all the way down here, right?"
"7486230","7487550"," Let's just say we pull back."
"7487850","7494350"," If this is a check of your of your upward trend on a one minute time frame, right?"
"7495050","7498950"," If that holds you're gonna see this happen right here. "
"7501940","7502640"," Here we'll just anticipate."
"7504540","7506460"," We'll just anticipate the trade, okay?"
"7508400","7509320"," Let's see if it works."
"7510580","7511600"," I'll leave my drawing up there. "
"7512520","7514940"," You might come down here and and tag this right here."
"7518270","7519650"," Just keep on pumping dude."
"7520410","7521530"," Just keep on fucking pumping. "
"7523310","7524810"," Keep on fucking pumping bro."
"7526710","7531210"," According to let the U.S. investment grade funds see three hundred and twenty four."
"7531330","7531870"," That's out of the way. "
"7532030","7532370"," So it's clean."
"7532770","7533650"," Clean that shit up."
"7543360","7547360"," Do you want to say up to date with the latest and the on the bleeding edge of news for"

"7560840","7562320"," Do you guys want me to just talk Tesla at this point?"
"7567330","7568310"," I can if you want."
"7568430","7570250"," I don't really want me doing that or not. "
"7570870","7572130"," I can't stand that stuff."
"7572270","7572950"," I'll be honest with you."
"7574370","7575290"," Hold on one second here. "
"7588310","7592730"," I always feel like I do that stuff on my own like I'll do my own like do diligence and"

"7595390","7599010"," I like I like I like the pre the pre I don't really like I like it with SpaceX."
"7599090","7602550"," I guess that's because I don't pay too much attention to SpaceX. "
"7602550","7604590"," I like them talking to me as the events happening."
"7605170","7610430"," But normally I'm like I don't really like the commentators until the event is going and then I"
"7610430","7613490"," really like somebody that knows what they're talking about during that event during the event."
"7613970","7618230"," So we're going to have somebody on here today that knows everything about Tesla and they're going"
"7618230","7623570"," to talk you through the event so we can get some some some trust out of not me but somebody"

"7703160","7704620"," 2 23 in the afternoon. "
"7705400","7710860"," I want you to also know that if you are trading spoos, cues or something else, we are going to"
"7710860","7714900"," switch to a Tesla chart at 3 p.m. as well."
"7715160","7718800"," So I'm going to have a Tesla chart and the video going for you in a little picture of me"
"7719310","7720240"," at the same time."

"7737040","7737840"," the presentation."
"7738940","7741840"," And we'll focus on Tesla roughly around. "
"7741840","7750460"," I said 3 p.m. but roughly around the 2.45 or so we'll switch into just talking Tesla at"
"7750460","7750820"," that point."
"7755690","7757190"," Make sure I got all that right."
"7761280","7763520"," Tesla squeezing up right now to the upside. "
"7772090","7773170"," Thanks for posting that."
"7774050","7775990"," Thanks for posting that Mr. Talking Monkey."
"7779340","7782100"," Tesla coming into its first resistance point right now. "
"7782740","7787760"," We still have that big yellow bar at the upside on book map to clear clear out."
"7787880","7791940"," We'll see if we can get up there and hit that supply zone up there that yellow that yellow box"
"7791940","7793000"," that you see right there."
"7795290","7796590"," This one right here. "
"7796590","7803100"," We'll see if we hit that right there at that upside target or if they try to trap us and"
"7803100","7804120"," send us down to the downside."
"7806240","7809100"," To be careful today too, you like like we got an event today."
"7809160","7810140"," We got end of the month. "
"7810140","7813220"," If you see something wonky happen, it's just like ERs."
"7813340","7815040"," You have all these tools they use."
"7815660","7817600"," You can sometimes see wacky shit happen. "
"7817840","7823700"," So don't ever like your training plan that you have on days like today might fail."
"7824560","7827200"," They fail on ERs, stuff like that."
"7828460","7830840"," It's hard to trade those events right. "
"7831060","7832800"," Those are unknown news to the market."
"7833020","7836600"," So today is one of those days being end of month."
"7837320","7843680"," You there's there's a there are banks out there that want this parked price part of they want the"
"7843680","7849920"," market park to the specific price in individual tickers parked at specific prices regardless of"
"7849920","7855460"," what you want to happen or you're like hey fundamentally or technically we should be here or gamma"
"7855460","7859420"," says we should be there or like all that stuff can be overridden on you. "
"7865920","7871120"," So be as long as nobody's buying or selling the market with real money, right?"
"7871300","7877660"," The moment the moment the big movers in the market either deal like a combination of sentiment and"
"7877660","7884480"," dealers and banks can run right over anything that you're like hey this works all the time and this"
"7884480","7885580"," one time it's not working."
"7885580","7886300"," Why is that?"
"7886820","7896560"," It's usually due to like an end of the month thing or an event with"
"7898140","7899940"," just a heads up on that as well."
"7903220","7905520"," Hey old Bacchos pachachos. "
"7905580","7905960"," How you doing man?"
"7911000","7913140"," If you have destroyed today that sucks man."
"7914080","7918860"," We're taking a trade together right now and so far we're green right?"
"7919100","7920340"," Everybody green out there right now?"
"7923440","7924660"," Is everybody green right now?"
"7924820","7927080"," Let me know in the chat trading with Captain Jim James."
"7927380","7928320"," Are you green right now?"
"7932330","7932830"," That's right. "
"7938280","7943420"," If you want to put stops on your trade, let's say you bought it 12 cents or you bought it"
"7943420","7944660"," 17 cents."
"7946220","7949680"," Let's say you bought one of the back tests, put some stops on your trade."
"7949900","7951760"," There's no shame in taking profit. "
"7953160","7957960"," So let's say you bought those calls for 10 cents or 12 cents at one point, raise up your stops,"
"7958280","7963160"," bring them to 15 or 14 cents, take some money off the table if you get crushed here."
"7971240","7973440"," You can't be big red trading with me today, you know."
"7973740","7974740"," It's impossible bro. "
"7974880","7975800"," It means you didn't trade with me."
"7976260","7977460"," It means you traded your own trade."
"7984780","7985700"," No, you're not trading. "
"7986520","7987360"," I got you, Nino."
"7989780","7999880"," Yeah, there's"
"7999880","8000800"," hidden sellers up here."
"8001000","8002080"," They're like hiding up there. "
"8002180","8002940"," You can see them up there."
"8004060","8006440"," You can see these bars like coming in and disappearing."
"8006800","8008540"," This is all hella sketchy, man. "
"8010140","8014560"," You can you can see like it's because then the fucking month is shitty day to trade."
"8014660","8015320"," I'll be honest with you."
"8015880","8020340"," What I really wanted to say to you guys this morning was don't fucking trade today. "
"8020400","8021440"," That's what I wanted to say to you."
"8022740","8023840"," Like just don't bother."
"8026020","8031700"," Although I'm fascinated to see if we trade 46 for 60 at like four o'clock in the afternoon, like"
"8031700","8033760"," right at four p.m., like boom, 460. "
"8035300","8036220"," That's it would be hilarious."
"8041340","8042380"," Just heads up too."
"8042520","8044400"," We are coming into SPX. "
"8044880","8045760"," I didn't notice that."
"8046380","8048880"," So we're coming in a resistance right now in SPX."
"8048980","8053340"," If you look in the bottom of your screen, this is the 4550. "
"8053900","8054580"," So just be careful."
"8054580","8055780"," They're going to try to sell you down here."
"8058690","8062110"," Well, we are coming into the 4550 resistance. "
"8064820","8074620"," And if you want us to trade that 4600 on the end of that to trade that, just be careful."
"8084120","8085260"," I didn't see that."
"8085300","8086980"," If I had seen that, I would have said something to you guys. "
"8087800","8091280"," I would have said, take the money on the top tick over here on the left hand side here."
"8091660","8092520"," I didn't see that."
"8093380","8094080"," That's my bad. "
"8094160","8094800"," I wasn't paying attention."
"8094920","8096860"," I was blabbing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"8099080","8100280"," We might bleed us right now. "
"8109350","8114870"," I got a limit or a stop limit down below and a limit's on the upside too."
"8114950","8115470"," So just heads up."
"8125320","8127080"," I got to post that on fin to it. "
"8157990","8160230"," Yeah, they're going to try to sell this."
"8161950","8180500"," They got a, uh, they got a, uh, 9x"
"8180500","8185140"," gasoline, December futures, settle at $2.9. Trying to buy something, trying to buy that dip right"
"8185140","8185400"," there."
"8187260","8188120"," I missed the trade. "
"8188260","8189440"," I tried to add some calls right there."
"8189520","8193600"," I just tried to add some calls on this bar and they left me behind."
"8194219","8197940"," I was trying to add some more calls in here for, it's called the liquidation break right here. "
"8198400","8199900"," It's trying to stop you out right here."
"8201240","8205580"," And I was trying to grab a, I was trying to add to my position right here and it fucking"
"8205580","8206639"," didn't bill."
"8208040","8214040"," 9x WTI crude January futures, settle at $75.96 a barrel. "
"8214299","8222760"," That's down $1.90 or 2.44%. Come on, man."
"8231389","8235389"," Protect your trade from macro headline risk with financial use pro."
"8235889","8239190"," Now only $99 a year for our real time service. "
"8239350","8239610"," That sucks."
"8239809","8241830"," I could have, I wish I'd, I wish I'd, fuck."
"8242690","8243330"," It makes me angry. "
"8248190","8248549"," 232."
"8249930","8251049"," Give me one second here."
"8251170","8252110"," I'm going to start switching over. "
"8252290","8253090"," I'm still in a trade here."
"8253129","8253950"," I'm going to switch over here."
"8261620","8263299"," Come on, spoos, break above. "
"8267400","8268420"," What is going on here?"

"8292620","8294740"," Just fucking squeeze it. "
"8304700","8309240"," Tesla squeezing right now, breaking above its first resistance."
"8318299","8320540"," It's coming into its second resistance right here."
"8324360","8328360"," Tesla, if Tesla can get above 240, it's going to boom to like 242. "
"8329820","8332200"," It's just going to fucking rip some faces off."
"8332400","8333959"," So Tesla squeezing right now."
"8334440","8338420"," If it can get above 240, it's going to squeeze up to 240. "
"8338700","8339100"," 180."
"8341809","8342670"," Come on, baby."

"8388320","8389960"," Give me a green bar. "
"8390440","8391860"," Big fat fucking green bar."
"8392140","8392820"," Slam into it."
"8398690","8399430"," Come on. "
"8417170","8419570"," Just one giant fucking green bar."
"8420790","8421970"," Make us some money, dude."
"8422090","8423410"," Make us fucking 100% trade. "

"8427490","8427930"," Squeeze."
"8437670","8438250"," Careful here. "
"8438470","8442970"," Watch SPX coming into that node right now, that gamma node."
"8444190","8446290"," I don't blame you if you want to take the money and run here."
"8447330","8454930"," It's going to be not, it's on SPX. "
"8455690","8459170"," Remember, 4550 is a pretty decent resistance."
"8460050","8462670"," It's not top, but it's pretty big resistance up there."
"8464130","8472610"," If you take money off the trade at 4550 or just above it, you'll re-enter the trade from 4550"
"8472610","8474110"," to 4600. "
"8475650","8481350"," If we can hold 4550 on SPX, come on."
"8482570","8485050"," Trade 24 cents right now on calls."
"8487290","8488970"," Leer as low as 10 cents. "
"8489230","8491630"," I think this bar down here, they were 10 cents."
"8493090","8496370"," That's, yeah, I think there were 10 or 16 down here and then 10 down there."
"8501940","8502660"," Watch out. "
"8502760","8504060"," You're getting a little bit of rejection on Tesla."
"8505160","8506960"," You're getting some rejection on SPX right here."
"8508020","8511760"," From this point forward, you're on your own to manage your own trade out there, your own risk. "
"8512260","8519420"," Raise up your, what I'd say to you is raise your stops just below and chase this price up."
"8521830","8527950"," Now your upside stops, your downside stops because this is either going to squeeze or fully pull"
"8527950","8528210"," back."
"8579880","8585100"," Squawk Square is saying first person to spot me inside the Austin factory gets a special surprise. "
"8587850","8588970"," What else we got out here?"
"8590830","8596830"," Hold my whole Mars catalog saying if you're selling Tesla, I read that post from earlier."
"8597450","8600250"," If you're selling Tesla on Cybertruck Day, you can go fuck yourself."

"8611340","8620700"," I made a prediction yesterday of, I made a prediction yesterday of a prediction that you're going"
"8620700","8628360"," to see Elon Musk announce, at least the equipment and software for level four, level five self "
"8628360","8628780","-driving."
"8630040","8634100"," He might be able to push it off and say, yeah, the bureaucracy and the red tape and all that"
"8634100","8634660"," kind of stuff. "
"8634840","8639920"," We can't do it right now or it's still in development, but I think from what I understand you're"
"8639920","8641660"," going to hear that today."
"8642760","8646780"," That's what I was told nine or 12 months ago."
"8647360","8652400"," So far all those predictions have worked themselves out. "
"8652780","8653840"," Be really careful there guys."
"8654100","8654980"," Be really careful here."
"8655720","8656740"," Raise up your stops. "
"8656900","8658900"," If you get stopped out, just take the money and run."
"8665190","8667490"," Alright, I'm going to start switching over here."
"8669050","8671090"," You guys ready to switch over to Tesla events?"
"8672690","8675930"," Give me a, let me know in the chat if you're ready to switch over to Tesla events. "
"8680600","8682040"," You guys are going to switch over right now?"
"8685200","8686540"," All right, just keep hanging out here."
"8687680","8689180"," We'll come back to Tesla like what?"
"8689440","8690480"," The 245 or something?"
"8694290","8695810"," Uncle JBJ saying, yeah, switch it over."
"8696030","8697610"," We don't have these too often do. "
"8697710","8699010"," It's pretty rare that we have a Tesla event."
"8702000","8703420"," Yeah, I'll leave it on spy for the moment."
"8703560","8708560"," Then we'll flip right over it like 250 or something, 255 for the Tesla event. "
"8708940","8710140"," I want to hear, I want to see this shit."
"8710180","8710920"," I think it's cool as fuck."
"8712240","8720120"," Whether you like or dislike the look of Tesla, the design of Tesla, it's still a, it's still a"
"8720120","8722840"," fucking, it's still a cool ass truck, even if you don't like the design. "

"8730920","8732160"," looking truck at some point."
"8732540","8739840"," Someone was mentioning they're going to possibly announce robo-taxis today or even a compact car."
"8740200","8741300"," You know what would be awesome too?"
"8742320","8748400"," A true SUV, like everyone's on the the robo-taxi in the compact or subcompact. "
"8749160","8750980"," Here's your PT2 right here."
"8752220","8754780"," I'm going to take the money up here in PT2."
"8754880","8756450"," Don't forget what I said to you. "
"8759540","8761420"," Trade in 27, 28 right now."

"8786530","8790590"," There's things about it that I don't like, I don't like, but it's mostly just my own personal"
"8790590","8790970"," tastes."
"8791490","8795140"," I'd really like to see either like one of those old school Toyota trucks, like a really small one"
"8795140","8799020"," to full size bed, like a pick me up the old school Toyota B1. "
"8799180","8799880"," Is that Mazda?"
"8800180","8802740"," Did those B1000s, or maybe the T900 or something they had?"
"8803600","8811440"," Take your money and run here, selling 29 cents."
"8821970","8822410"," Sweet."
"8824110","8825290"," Good job, Momo Land. "

"8859890","8862830"," I don't like SUVs, but it sells like hotcakes."
"8865520","8866840"," People would love an SUV. "
"8869570","8871230"," Yeah, first gen Tacoma would be nice too."
"8871490","8876070"," First, like the first gen Toyota trucks that they were selling in the early 90s, no 80s or not"
"8876070","8878210"," eight, no seven late 70s, early 80s."
"8878230","8878670"," I love those. "

"9027570","9029150"," I left that on the table."
"9029430","9039420"," Do we get full 40 cents climbing the wall of worry?"
"9040100","9040620"," Who said that?"
"9040820","9042040"," Who said climbing the wall of worry?"

"9067420","9071500"," They'll try to stop trigger your stops and then make the next leg up."

"9086800","9093780"," And then to the upside up there your next gamma bar on spoons. "

"9834550","9839270"," We already had the bull plane on the one minute basis on Tesla traded that and now we're looking"
"9839270","9843530"," for a five minute check to see if we can trade the five minute chart on Tesla to the upside"
"9843530","9845210"," into the close."

"10784820","10785820"," But check these guys out."
"10786040","10790340"," If you like what they say, they're very intelligent, very knowledgeable about Tesla."
"10790880","10791260"," Hold on here. "
"10792380","10793400"," I'm going to post that."
"10793420","10797300"," I'm going to post their handles on Fintuit right now on YouTube and on Twitch."
"10798260","10800100"," These guys are great, man. "
"10800400","10800920"," Unbelievable."
"10801000","10802780"," I trade with both of you."
"10802860","10809200"," Well, I trade with Brian Griffo indirectly right now, but Joe Donut and I trade together all the"
"10809200","10809540"," time. "
"10812760","10815200"," So I did post both their names."
"10815200","10815660"," There he goes."
"10815800","10816160"," Two guys. "
"10816420","10818740"," I just gave links to both of their handles."
"10819140","10820200"," Show these guys some love."
"10820320","10820620"," It's free. "
"10820780","10821240"," Just go out there."
"10821420","10823600"," Follow them on Fintuit."
"10829440","10830060"," All right. "
"10830160","10830600"," You guys ready?"
"10833580","10834240"," All right."
"10834340","10834780"," Hey, tight here."
"10839000","10839700"," All right. "
"10840420","10841500"," Say some boys."
"10849600","10852900"," So we got Tesla Wolf and Joey Donut on their line today."
"10854860","10859600"," We're pumped today for the day after four years, but in the reservation four years ago. "
"10860340","10861260"," I mean, right?"
"10861860","10865100"," Dude, did you, were you first day reservation, Brian?"
"10865660","10866800"," No, I was working."
"10866980","10871420"," I put it in a couple days after, which actually is a significant bump down the line."
"10871680","10874860"," It was before the end of the week, but I think I could be back a year. "
"10875300","10879440"," But hey, that's probably maybe to work them out before I get by the line was first."
"10880020","10884080"," I was those day one, but I wasn't like really early on day one."
"10884340","10888660"," So my reservation is like 80,000 or something like that. "
"10889520","10890320"," So we'll see."
"10890600","10891100"," They really get this."
"10891220","10894880"," They really get this demand and they're doing 250 a year. "
"10895100","10898760"," You're talking about six, seven year late for people from New Year's today."
"10899220","10900220"," You could think that's probably it."
"10900480","10901700"," So for me, yeah, that's crazy. "
"10902160","10907560"," Well, that might be what then once again, I'm sure we'll have, you know, there were millions that"
"10907560","10908740"," reserved a Model 3."
"10909440","10919400"," But everybody that reserved one, they got them within a, you know, before they made"
"10919400","10923100"," their 1.5 million Model 3."
"10923500","10926660"," So it would be interesting to see how many they keep, right?"
"10926900","10929700"," Like it's not how many reservations they secure."
"10930200","10931480"," Tell me your reservations, they deliver."
"10931980","10938220"," And so it'll be, I would say that we probably have at least a year and a half, probably for"
"10938220","10941000"," all the trim levels, reservations to be filled. "
"10941920","10943600"," Yeah, they're going to fill them."
"10943800","10951540"," They've already said pretty much, they're going to fill them in the order of dual motor first, base"
"10951540","10952120"," dual motor."
"10952420","10954660"," And then they're going to try and make the tri motor. "
"10956140","10962120"," And then after that, we were having that kind of discussion before we got, we got introduced for"
"10962120","10964160"," while we were in the kind of the waiting room."
"10964760","10972720"," Yeah, single motor diver truck is going to be elusive, I believe, until everybody that pre-ordered"
"10972720","10975740"," one has their truck."
"10976520","10982600"," So it seems like people think like a 10 grand going to first place it because we know the"
"10982600","10986080"," purchasing power is even for crazy years, right?"
"10986900","10990240"," Yeah, I don't know where they're going to see for a starting price. "
"10990600","10993880"," Maybe the minimum may be $49.99. I'm not sure."
"10994420","10996300"," It's on a single motor."
"10996920","10998080"," You have to have that. "
"11000000","11003900"," But yeah, we have to get it might take a year and a half, two years before we see those."
"11004700","11010900"," So it could easily be, you know, depending on how inflation goes between now and when that would"
"11010900","11011240"," happen."
"11012180","11013360"," It could be even more. "
"11013840","11021160"," So, you know, you look at the cost of an entry level, any entry level truck right now, and they're"
"11021160","11022540"," really, they're really going up."
"11023760","11028660"," So it would be really interesting to see where it shakes out."
"11029160","11034420"," But needless to say, at this launch event, I feel like no one's going to be getting delivery of"
"11034420","11038120"," their cars for anything under $70K. "
"11039320","11040320"," Yeah, that sounds right."
"11040480","11042840"," They always start higher end and just move down market."
"11043220","11044440"," So that would make sense. "
"11045000","11050380"," Yeah, I went and saw it this weekend, dropped down to the city and it's like a work of art."
"11050620","11056740"," And I almost, yeah, not to like it as much as I did, because maybe I've got enough, not going"
"11056740","11057480"," crazy with it."
"11057620","11061100"," But I think, yeah, it's like a work of art and something. "
"11061640","11063880"," Well, you know, I've been watching you, Brian."
"11064240","11067400"," You and I've been friends now, even longer than I've known to have."
"11067760","11075680"," And I know that you've been waiting as the most bullish Tesla person I know. "
"11076080","11080320"," Yes, we have four years to get a Tesla."
"11082720","11087460"," I saw the tail often, but like back in the day, I wanted that silver model three so bad."
"11087460","11089380"," And one, they just continued that color. "
"11089640","11090900"," I threw it into the stock instead."
"11091480","11096480"," And I mean, right now, I have a five year old model three and, you know, not like seven figures."
"11096820","11101860"," So it's like, I put that into the right instead and it's the way that the city's in there, whatever"
"11101860","11102420"," you want to say. "
"11102640","11108160"," But yeah, I mean, waiting on the car and buying the name, buying more of the name in those those"
"11108160","11112240"," middle years, the last decade was probably would move in the long run."
"11112500","11116920"," I mean, yeah, I didn't even have bought the Model S because I didn't want to wait on a Model"
"11116920","11117280"," 3."
"11118300","11121780"," I had a reservation for a Model 3 until I'm the reverse of you."
"11122160","11124720"," And because of that, I'm still like, you know, still working. "
"11125360","11126700"," Well, we're both doing happy."
"11127600","11129420"," So at the end of the day, that's all that matter."
"11129640","11131680"," Are you still driving the same Model S or would you?"
"11131900","11132340"," I am. "
"11132580","11133940"," I still have the same Model S."
"11134340","11137720"," My wife has since bought, we bought her a Model 3."
"11138200","11146180"," It was completely obliterated in a T-bone accident where she got caled and but it kept my family"
"11146180","11146580"," safe."
"11147280","11148900"," Because both of my kids were in the back."
"11149560","11152660"," And then in 2020, that happened in 2022. "
"11153540","11159020"," And then we took delivery of a Model Y that same year to replace it."
"11159440","11160420"," And we saw about that."
"11161640","11163960"," And the it was it was pretty great. "
"11163960","11166180"," We actually got really lucky because it was in 2019."
"11166980","11169620"," And and we got rex."
"11170140","11171120"," It got totaled. "
"11171840","11178400"," And the insurance company paid me about $3,800 more than I paid for it in 2019 and 2022."
"11178600","11181780"," Because even at that time when you just couldn't get a car."
"11182380","11186860"," So she got paid to drive that car for a few years. "
"11188260","11188740"," Nice."
"11189520","11190440"," That worked out well."
"11191180","11192420"," We really did. "
"11192760","11194580"," We really did."
"11194740","11197760"," But then we paid way more for the Model Y than they're selling for now."
"11197760","11201740"," So I guess it all it all comes back around. "
"11203060","11203620"," Yeah."
"11203760","11204900"," What do you think yesterday about that?"
"11205100","11211220"," The old book interview, Elon dropping some real some real hard words there with Sorkin."
"11211360","11218040"," You know, it was I was it was two two completely different sides of myself at war. "
"11218520","11227780"," On the one hand, I really really enjoyed hearing him say that and watching a room full of people"
"11227780","11235460"," that were basically, you know, spent the whole day like rubbing each other and making them feel"
"11235460","11236720"," like masters of the universe."
"11237360","11243200"," Suddenly get basically called to go and you know, and pleasure themselves."
"11244200","11251060"," And then him calling out Eiger directly was just I mean, it was it was beautiful. "
"11251500","11260880"," But at the same time, I was a little worried because when when you get, you know, everybody's been"
"11260880","11264640"," referring to getting to fuck you and I'm sorry about the language."
"11264640","11267160"," But like that's the kind of money that you have, right?"
"11267740","11270940"," You know, say once I get to this level, I'm gonna fuck you."
"11271160","11277520"," Well, he is at the like highest level you can obtain for that. "
"11278180","11286200"," And I think some very wealthy and various powerful people are probably looking at this in a very"
"11286200","11294060"," negative light that we can't let someone obtain this level of power and financial freedom and not"
"11294060","11294400"," happen."
"11295040","11298000"," Either be one of us and play by our rules."
"11299820","11307560"," And that has only happened a few times in history where someone was a great innovator, but refused"
"11307560","11309700"," to, you know, to bow. "
"11310320","11315920"," And it hasn't worked out in any of those situations I can think of."
"11316260","11322260"," A lot of comparison from Cap has been saying it's like a Howard Hughes kind of guy."
"11322260","11324740"," And I would agree with that comparison. "
"11325420","11335100"," But even more, like, like incredibly, you know, way more money, way more power, way more"
"11335100","11339480"," influence, Elon is way on another level than Howard Hughes was."
"11340360","11341360"," What do you thought?"
"11341780","11343340"," What were your thoughts, Brian?"
"11343660","11346660"," Well, I was talking to Andy Nelson this morning about it."
"11346820","11349000"," He's actually a big fan of having a dream. "
"11349000","11349960"," And I know, you know, Andy."
"11350160","11350720"," Yeah, I love it."
"11350780","11351180"," I love Andy. "
"11351180","11351600"," Oh, yeah."
"11352680","11355420"," Yeah, but we were talking about it as investors."
"11355760","11360760"," It's like there's, you know, where it's to be a fan of like a CEO that has some impact and,"
"11360800","11365820"," you know, is able to have some class and navigate things kind of smoothly. "
"11366360","11369320"," And with Elon, it's just, it's not at least that."
"11369720","11375280"," But I know they're happy he loves it because it's like, I mean, he's saying, I'm not trying all my"
"11375280","11377880"," best to do the thing that looks like it's the right thing."
"11377980","11380480"," I'm actually just trying to do the goddamn right thing. "
"11381120","11382520"," And that's like, that's so refreshing."
"11382960","11388720"," Because I think that's a real thing nowadays where people put in more effort into how the thing"
"11388720","11390860"," looks than actually doing the thing the right way."
"11391300","11397120"," So yeah, it's a great point of two minds, you know, really split on it, you know, make sure hard,"
"11397260","11399000"," happy, but you're, you're had crazy. "
"11399400","11403060"," It's a, it's the Elon half that you get for investing in this company."
"11403120","11403680"," That's right."
"11404040","11404820"," That's right. "
"11408200","11409740"," It's the Elon task."
"11413260","11414160"," So true."
"11415060","11421880"," I mean, is it something about, you know, being as usual, is it the diver?"
"11422240","11423340"," What do you got this week?"
"11423560","11424320"," I used to pick your thing. "
"11424740","11427000"," Just like, you gotta take the as with the bad."
"11427180","11427760"," That's the ball."
"11428280","11432020"," Like, that's the ball. "
"11433320","11443280"," Yeah, I think with Elon, it's so funny because he's, it's sort of like the old saying"
"11443280","11446880"," of, you know, when someone tells you who they are, trust, you know, believe them, right?"
"11447720","11452720"," Elon has been exactly who he is right now, all along."
"11453640","11459100"," He just, every once in a while, he like says the quiet part of what he is saying quietly."
"11460080","11463200"," He says the not, you know, the part you're not supposed to say out loud. "
"11463220","11464540"," He'll say it out loud, right?"
"11464780","11467160"," Like, like him saying, I don't like it."
"11469140","11477340"," I think he, there is a part of, there's a part of what he said yesterday that at least"
"11477340","11481740"," it resonated with people without power, right?"
"11482240","11487960"," That there's someone out there that can stand up at least to the perceived man or whatever, you"
"11487960","11488060"," know."
"11489560","11493640"," How many people go up there around his comments was very positive. "
"11494220","11499500"," Like, on Twitter, if you, I went in and just kind of look around and there are a ton of"
"11499500","11504200"," people going, I don't even like Elon, but I really like the fact that he told Bob Iger to go"
"11504200","11504900"," and sell."
"11507560","11509300"," New fan, yeah, for sure."
"11509700","11510260"," He did. "
"11510620","11514400"," Yeah, I mean, we're not in the Tesla world that we're like paying for us now."
"11514500","11515320"," I'm going to get the premium."
"11515500","11515780"," Welcome. "
"11516140","11517100"," Here we go, guys."
"11517360","11523060"," Yeah, because she's welcome to this mama, then there you go."
"11524160","11528040"," So we got the event happening, like right on time, it's 20 minutes late, right?"
"11528420","11531700"," So we, I don't know if you guys are screaming in Korea. "
"11532000","11533560"," Yeah, we're screaming it on the screen right now."
"11534820","11539420"," So once, once in a while, I unfortunately can't watch it once in a long while."
"11540140","11546420"," And I also can't hear it because that is not, uh, rare that you guys are listening to. "
"11546620","11548760"," Once in every once every five, he's speaking right now."
"11548840","11549640"," He's speaking right now."
"11551080","11556360"," Something really special, a really unusual product, comes along. "
"11557640","11559980"," And we'll remember those."
"11560060","11562240"," Yeah, I don't know if you want to use our audio."
"11562500","11563480"," Yeah, yeah. "
"11563640","11567280"," Let me, uh, let me just say, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll let you know when I want, or not"
"11567280","11569920"," when I want you, but when you're ready, just let me know."
"11571120","11572080"," So special moments."
"11574480","11578410"," So, but these things are rare. "
"11579230","11585150"," It's very rare that our product comes along that is, uh, seemingly impossible."
"11586390","11588170"," Uh, that, that people said was impossible."
"11588450","11590730"," That experts said was impossible. "
"11591970","11593310"," And this is one of those times."
"11593890","11595190"," Yeah, the lighting is kind of weird, right?"
"11595530","11598570"," We have a, we have a car here that experts said was impossible."
"11599010","11601350"," That experts said would never be made. "
"11602410","11610890"," That, uh, it really is the most, I think it's, I think it's our best product."
"11611130","11613210"," I think it's the most unique thing on the road."
"11614050","11617890"," And finally, the future will look like the future. "
"11623190","11624850"," It's really dark, right?"
"11626830","11633250"," So what we're aiming for here is something that has, that's more truck than truck."
"11635770","11636330"," Okay."
"11638390","11639170"," Thanks bro. "
"11640850","11642610"," That's literally my brother there."
"11644990","11646950"," The video is kind of weird right now."
"11647110","11653430"," And, um, and so what we have here is, is something that is a better truck than a truck while"
"11653430","11655830"," also being a better sports car than a sports car. "
"11656370","11657390"," In the same package."
"11658910","11665290"," So, first of all, let's, uh, you know, let's talk about how, you know, trucks are tough."
"11665630","11668130"," That's one of the defining characteristics of a truck. "
"11668910","11670430"," So how tough is this truck?"
"11671170","11672770"," Let's find out."
"11673390","11679690"," Um, I mean, all I've been seeing is, uh, so we actually had to come up with a special artist"
"11679690","11682870"," wrong, uh, Tesla designed steel alloy."
"11683410","11686850"," So this alloy did, this, this, this metal did not exist before. "
"11687610","11689490"," Uh, we needed something that you could actually manufacture."
"11690810","11695070"," But, uh, that would be, uh, have basically no corrosion."
"11695950","11698010"," Um, that didn't need paint. "
"11698730","11701030"," Uh, but you can still make it a volume."
"11702170","11706670"," And part of the reason that it has this angular shape is you can't actually stamp these body"
"11706670","11707050"," panels."
"11707470","11709890"," The body panels would break the stamping machine. "
"11712410","11719250"," So, uh, oh, and I should say also the, because of the steel exoskeleton, it actually has more"
"11719250","11721310"," torsional rigidity than a sports car."
"11721590","11724630"," It has more torsional stiffness than a McLaren P1."
"11726860","11729340"," So it's, that's very, that's a big deal. "
"11730140","11734560"," Um, now you may remember, uh, an incident four years"
"11734560","11741180"," ago."
"11742750","11744570"," France, I think we should try it again."
"11755010","11759430"," Oh, here we go. "
"11759590","11759930"," Here we go."
"11760050","11760690"," They're going to throw the baseball."
"11762490","11763710"," Do you guys watch the baseball?"
"11766270","11769310"," They cut, they caught it on the edge. "
"11770010","11772110"," He, he missed the actual window or the door panel."
"11776290","11776650"," Yeah."
"11777010","11777370"," Great. "
"11777930","11780850"," I mean, I think you could probably have a picture of a lot of it."
"11781130","11785950"," Um, so anyway, it's the, the, the glass is tough, basically."
"11786370","11786850"," That's what we're saying. "
"11787810","11793490"," Um, so, uh, you don't have to worry about like rocks hitting the glass and cracking the glass."
"11793790","11796550"," This glass, this glass is basically rock proof."
"11797330","11799010"," Um, it's also makes the car very quiet. "
"11799330","11806090"," So, it's the thing that you'll appreciate when you drive the car is that is how smooth and quiet it"
"11806090","11806310"," is."
"11806690","11810890"," It does, it does, it feels, it doesn't feel like, like a normal truck."
"11811110","11815790"," It's, it's smooth as silk and, and, and silent, uh, when you drive it. "
"11816470","11818650"," Um, and, um, yeah."
"11819010","11820810"," So tough in terms of toughness."
"11821550","11827470"," And then things like rollover, because the center of gravity is so low, it doesn't roll over. "
"11829230","11832550"," Yeah, that is nice about how wide it is, how low it is with another car."
"11832790","11833110"," You will win."
"11833110","11837690"," And the weight from the batteries is showing the rollover right now. "
"11839290","11840690"," Are you, you're both watching it, right?"
"11845710","11849870"," Let me see if, let me see if I can get it on for you."
"11849890","11850170"," Hold on."
"11850390","11851510"," I might hear pizza or something. "
"11864570","11870230"," Yeah, it's, um, I'm going to try to think of anything that may be, it's maybe close to an old,"
"11870230","11875570"," old school, uh, brand wagon air, or maybe the, it's maybe, I don't know if it's near the commander"
"11875570","11877050"," or the commander is pretty wide."
"11877150","11884310"," Any movies you sometimes see the hero, heroin, uh, hiding behind the car door, uh, while being shot"
"11884310","11884690"," with bullets."
"11884870","11885870"," That doesn't actually work. "
"11886010","11891430"," That was my one issue with the off-road, and the thin road, you're going to get pinstrokes on it,"
"11891470","11892590"," which is going to still get that ass."
"11892590","11895430"," It's al Capone, like Utah pinstrokes or something like that."
"11895430","11897350"," Put it on the gun and empty the entire magazine. "
"11897350","11897910"," It's kind of cool."
"11898030","11898970"," It's like into the car door."
"11898970","11901070"," You're not really a back, you're not really an off-road rider. "
"11901470","11903990"," So in the west, if you don't have some, uh, you know, it's a cool stuff."
"11904190","11910350"," When you drive around, you know, hit a little bit of a rock around the turn on a one-way,"
"11910510","11913170"," uh, back-road road, it's got a little scratch in the side."
"11913390","11915770"," Because the, the other trucks, the bullets go through both sides. "
"11916610","11918730"," So, uh, you shoot a bullet, go through both sides of the car."
"11919370","11921430"," Um, and uh, are you going to wrap yours?"
"11921890","11922750"," I'll just rip it off."
"11923130","11927090"," Sometimes you get these, like, late civilization, vibes. "
"11927210","11932750"," A little bit of when the apocalypse, uh, could come along at any moment."
"11933370","11937550"," And, um, at here, Tesla, we have the finest in apocalypse, uh, technology."
"11939750","11948290"," Uh, I was on the Joe Rogan show and, uh, Joe bet me a dollar that his armor-piercing steelhead"
"11948290","11949510"," arrow would go through the car. "
"11949990","11952150"," It, uh, hit, now he owes me a dollar."
"11953830","11956070"," Well, that's Joe Rogan firing the arrow right now."
"11960960","11962240"," Now, what about utility?"
"11963120","11970680"," So, strength is great, but is this, is this, like, you know, perhaps just a show truck, uh, just a,"
"11971060","11974660"," you know, a showpiece, or it can't do actual work. "
"11975320","11977400"," How does it work as a real everyday truck?"
"11977980","11979940"," Well, here we have the future towing the future."
"11986420","11994980"," So, uh, basically, if you can fit, uh, any cargo in the, in the trunk, or in the bed, you"
"11994980","11996040"," can basically move it around."
"11996700","12002780"," So, it's got, uh, over a ton of, uh, payload capability, which you can really put more than that in"
"12002780","12002880"," it. "
"12003420","12008320"," Uh, you can tow over 11,000 pounds, um, and it's got a super tough composite bed."
"12008500","12008980"," No liner needed."
"12009360","12015700"," The bed is six foot long, four foot wide, and you can fit, uh, no liner needed, four by eight"
"12015700","12020240"," piece of plywood in with the, with the, uh, with the back down. "
"12022680","12028980"," So, um, for those who are early into the truck world, there's, there's something, uh, in the truck"
"12028980","12030520"," world called a, a truck pull."
"12030960","12036980"," This is really the, the key test of how much power does your truck actually have."
"12037840","12045660"," So, you have to pull this, uh, 40,000 pound sled, and, uh, when we went to the track, we"
"12045660","12050060"," said, well, well, what's the best, uh, that, that you've seen?"
"12050140","12053580"," I said, well, it'd be the fourth, uh, F-350 diesel. "
"12054180","12056200"," It was like, well, let's, let's put our truck up against that."
"12056400","12060120"," The, the guy who runs the, the truck pull said that there's no way."
"12060840","12061520"," There's no way. "
"12061780","12062520"," It's like, well, let's try it."
"12063040","12063740"," Let's see what happens."
"12070640","12071240"," They're doing it. "
"12071340","12073820"," They like the dual motor, uh, pull right now, the dual motor."
"12073820","12076400"," I remember that test."
"12076620","12077040"," That was a blast. "
"12079100","12080880"," Look at the Rivian truck out there now."
"12081640","12082960"," Yeah, the Ford Rivian test."
"12083300","12084660"," They're, they're showing all the tests. "
"12087720","12089040"," Yeah, I never saw the Rivian."
"12089040","12089980"," I only saw the Ford."
"12091680","12093160"," That's new, new to me as well. "
"12106380","12107480"," Dude, look at that thing."
"12108200","12109180"," Dude, look at that thing."
"12109320","12109520"," Look at that thing. "
"12109780","12110720"," Look at that piece mode."
"12119630","12121130"," Piece mode right now, bro."
"12122250","12130090"," Oh, you get, he's gaining more confidence as he sits up there right now. "
"12131450","12134430"," We actually had to slightly turn the car at the end, so it didn't hit the wall."
"12134430","12137090"," Now he's showing the F-150 going two hundred and seven feet."
"12137270","12142810"," The Rivian went to, the Rivian went, uh, the F of Marley went two hundred and seven feet. "
"12143030","12143910"," Rivian went two hundred and two seven."
"12144310","12148350"," F-150 went two sixty three and now the truck went three hundred and eighteen feet."
"12148410","12154910"," Then I'll pull an F-350 diesel, uh, has a massive, massive, massive bed. "
"12155950","12158290"," He is an incredibly useful truck."
"12158430","12159250"," No, no, I don't need to hear it."
"12159330","12166630"," It's not just some it's actually, it's actually very useful. "
"12170390","12171550"," Now what about performance?"
"12176070","12177070"," It's getting me excited."
"12177870","12181530"," It has an adaptive S suspension, so no matter what the load is."
"12182070","12183090"," Yeah, I'm on the list, man. "
"12183710","12184930"," I'm thinking about buying."
"12185230","12189990"," I want to buy, like, I was on the fence, but seeing all this right now is a glow in"
"12189990","12190270"," the mind."
"12190670","12191650"," How much load is carrying?"
"12191650","12194070"," I want to take fucking Utah to White Rim Trail. "
"12194130","12198950"," I don't know if you'll fit on it, but that that's a true seven on White Rim Trail, but I,"
"12199030","12201870"," well, I love taking the deferential."
"12201870","12206290"," If you, if you guys out there, you guys live out west on the stream and you guys, uh, interested"
"12206290","12210670"," in buying this truck, uh, just for the back road driving or the off road driving, that kind of"
"12210670","12213890"," stuff, or you could, you could, uh, drive over basically anything."
"12214250","12217610"," We actually, uh, took this out of truck on a Baja rally drive. "
"12218750","12223190"," So this is insane off road capability."
"12223710","12223710"," Yeah."
"12225350","12228310"," It has locking deferential's rear torque vectoring. "
"12229230","12231670"," And the crazy thing is, look, you're just wearing comfort."
"12231970","12241110"," It has steer by wire, which is, it's one of the things where, let's move on to what that means,"
"12241270","12243910"," but it's what I had it."
"12244090","12247050"," So I'm from our west, which gives you a very cool thing. "
"12247110","12251610"," I had a, uh, Toyota, Tundra, it was the steering, your best truck of our own."
"12251750","12253750"," In the parking lot, it will turn the wheels a lot."
"12254110","12259190"," But if you, if you turn it on, yeah, it didn't have all the bells and whistles, the interior was,"
"12259190","12264470"," um, you know, the old, they don't ever update their interiors, but just, uh, form, function,"
"12264730","12268770"," pandling, gas, gas mileage, best gas mileage in five, period. "
"12268930","12270430"," Actually, and it has a turning so cool."
"12270650","12273450"," But that's the thing, you would be bad ass, Brian, like this would be."
"12273770","12278550"," So this thing can pack correctly, turn it, you know, travel to something, you know, dime these. "
"12278750","12282530"," It has incredible low speed maneuverability."
"12282710","12285630"," What about a rack for it or an extension for the bed to haul your lumber?"
"12285890","12286550"," With a whole bunch of it."
"12286550","12292610"," And then, uh, it's just not a, I mean, advanced details on those, uh, it's the first time that the"
"12292610","12297170"," car is moving to a 48-volt, uh, low voltage off-texture for 12 volts, which has been around for"
"12297170","12297590"," 100 years. "
"12299110","12302690"," Um, we have even that car."
"12302890","12304270"," Aren't you up by the Santa Cristo Mountains?"
"12304610","12307110"," I thought you were in the south, or the northern, or the northern west of the Cristo Mountains."
"12307510","12313930"," Um, and it's, uh, it's really, the, um, the internals are as advanced as the externals. "
"12314150","12316710"," It's, uh, it's, uh, they hold new step-changing the technology."
"12316710","12318970"," That piece where I grew up on Lake Erie."
"12319350","12320050"," Oh, right on. "
"12321410","12323210"," So, let's take it to the racetrack."
"12324070","12327850"," And see how, how does the Cybertruck perform against the Porsche 911?"
"12328510","12330370"," So, you're up by Lake Erie right now."
"12330630","12332550"," And I should say this is, this is an actual Porsche. "
"12333550","12335050"," We literally just got it from the dealer."
"12336010","12337530"," 2023, Porsche 911."
"12338590","12345670"," I got a- I'm gonna do the, um, Grippo has a Tesla range going up there in the home"
"12345670","12346410"," state of New York. "
"12346990","12350710"," Dude, I'm, uh, doing, Grippo, you're gonna come with me this summer."
"12350850","12356270"," I'm gonna do the, if you go to the trailer's column, it's a bike, a bike trail from Cleveland to,"
"12357450","12361070"," um, what does the bike trail call look like?"
"12364070","12365330"," But wait, there's more."
"12365450","12365990"," This is a different one. "
"12366190","12374170"," The one that I was, um, Dude, they're at a 60 right now."
"12377930","12379750"," 2.6 seconds."
"12384110","12391950"," So the- It's so stupid. "
"12392790","12399550"," It can, it can tow a Porsche 911 across a quarter mile, faster than the Porsche 911 can grow by"
"12399550","12399950"," itself."
"12404110","12405990"," There's no way that's just the dual."
"12407530","12409070"," This is a tougher than bullets. "
"12410310","12411430"," Uh, tow pretty much anything."
"12411470","12412130"," Faster than a 911."
"12412470","12415050"," Uh, faster than a 911 while towing a 911. "
"12415510","12420210"," They did that same, they did that same race when they were talking about the, uh, the model lines."
"12420570","12420850"," Again now."
"12420950","12421670"," It was towing a 911. "
"12422050","12422250"," Thank you."
"12424050","12428990"," Dude, just the fact that it's a truck, like, it's just like smoke."
"12431070","12431510"," So. "
"12435470","12435870"," Okay."
"12436570","12440930"," I can appreciate you're going to take the place and pull up lake areas that would happen to you."
"12441150","12445730"," Oh, oh, so I got, it's a, I think it's a 330 mile trip. "
"12446150","12449730"," Five miles to go like bike packing for, I think, five or six days."
"12450390","12451050"," It's near you."
"12451150","12453850"," It's near New York, uh, Cleveland's closest to you, isn't it?"
"12455390","12455790"," Yeah. "
"12456010","12460870"," Yeah, it's from Cincinnati."
"12463650","12465010"," We're going to bring Joe in that trip."
"12466250","12466970"," Yo, Jonah. "
"12467150","12467790"," It's easy, dude."
"12468050","12469010"," Like Ohio is flat."
"12469370","12471570"," It's just like, it's like buddy hike in her buddy. "
"12471950","12472870"," It's like a buddy trip."
"12473150","12474650"," It's not something where it's completely out of everything."
"12474770","12478470"," Hey, like, can I get like a little helmet and a little side car?"
"12478950","12479430"," You just pedal?"
"12479650","12480410"," Hell yeah, dude. "
"12481430","12483950"," Well, I have, and now I have an electric bike."
"12484210","12486530"," So if you want, I can put a post-rap on it and pull you behind me."
"12486530","12487110"," It's a good vehicle. "
"12487770","12494290"," I can tell you guys, I don't know if you want to run all of this golf."
"12494630","12498490"," All you said back there is you just following the crack and having a good time."
"12501210","12501970"," Oh, here we go. "
"12502070","12502430"," What's going on?"
"12502910","12504010"," The stock goes down."
"12504230","12504890"," I'm sure remember that."
"12505730","12507310"," These are the actual owners. "
"12507610","12508470"," We're heading over production."
"12508990","12510550"," I have a truck to the actual owners."
"12510790","12511750"," Thank you, buying a saboteur. "
"12514590","12516670"," How many do you figure that I can deliver?"
"12529150","12536750"," I mean, maybe not all of those 30 things, particularly some of them, I'm not sure."
"12537170","12540990"," My brother is at the event right now, so I want to see if I see him here."
"12542190","12543170"," I want to see if he's here. "
"12543550","12544350"," I want to see if I can see him."
"12546630","12548790"," Yeah, you can barely make out."
"12549450","12550950"," If I see him, I'll point them out. "
"12554730","12557770"," There's some pros that make out if you see them point them out."
"12557850","12560510"," I'm going to point them out if I could see them, I'll point them out to you."
"12561750","12563290"," Do you can barely see you on?"
"12563570","12563910"," Yeah. "
"12566890","12568430"," My monitor screen is huge."
"12568670","12572010"," I got a huge monitor screen here playing it, so I'm going to pick them out."
"12572610","12574650"," I'll throw a screen capture in a circle's face. "
"12577030","12578110"," We should take that trip."
"12578350","12580570"," I think Joe seems apprehensive."
"12580690","12581470"," He's like 300 miles. "
"12581690","12582890"," He's like, we're doing 300 miles a day."
"12583070","12583570"," We're a bloody ride."
"12584490","12588890"," We go town to town and do some drinking, but you are in, right on, right on. "
"12589910","12595630"," I gave you my, I gave you my, like, well, as you can see, we've got quite a few living"
"12595630","12595870"," here."
"12596170","12597910"," This isn't the rag-rai race, though."
"12598010","12599230"," The rag-rai race, the brutal one. "
"12599310","12601530"," That one's like 100 mile a day, so it's seven straight days."
"12601530","12602230"," That's horrible."
"12602490","12602950"," Oh, wow. "
"12603230","12603290"," Okay."
"12603950","12605050"," Welcome to his condition."
"12605190","12605850"," That's my car. "
"12606090","12607130"," You're going to enjoy your car?"
"12607250","12607450"," Yeah."
"12607730","12608230"," I remember."
"12608850","12610190"," That was my condition. "
"12611290","12614170"," Do you want to bring a bottle for you to suck off of?"
"12614370","12615110"," I don't."
"12615690","12619550"," If I'm going on vacation, I don't want to come back in better shape than I like."
"12621570","12625990"," Oh, hey, just heads up out there. "
"12626430","12629530"," Tesla price looks like it's a little bit squeezy here."
"12629530","12635630"," Not quite a, um, we'll plan at this point to try to resist this, but we'll, we'll see if we"
"12635630","12641230"," get, if we get that, that turnaround of this upside target to the, to the upside here."
"12641330","12643670"," It's not quite there yet, but we'll keep an eye on it. "
"12644810","12654810"," The, um, so did, did, uh, they announced final pricing in the, uh, I haven't heard anything yet."
"12655890","12656290"," Yeah."
"12656750","12657450"," Enjoy your truck?"
"12657790","12658190"," Yeah. "
"12658850","12659250"," Yeah."
"12659570","12667250"," Well, that's like when I signed up for it was a small print was like, uh, the pricing can change."
"12668630","12669830"," And time has changed. "
"12669850","12674030"," I mean, we, we have inflation now, we have, like, cost of goods and stuff like that."
"12674110","12681010"," I'm not, I'm sure it's going to be, well, I'm not sure, but what do you think the, when I"
"12681010","12682450"," originally reserved on him."
"12682830","12686830"," It was like 49. "
"12687570","12687650"," Yeah."
"12689750","12692010"," 59, 79, 79 was the last part."
"12692410","12692790"," Yeah. "
"12693670","12699310"," And so for something like that, and there's no way we're anywhere near those not present anymore."
"12699530","12700510"," If we are, I'm shocked."
"12701130","12702170"," Yeah, I'd be shocked too. "
"12702370","12702730"," Definitely."
"12704910","12707610"," Does anybody in the chat, does anybody in the chat note?"
"12707610","12711650"," Has anybody seen any new pricing or the cyber truck anybody know in the chat?"
"12712670","12721590"," Well, this is a delivery event, you"
"12721590","12737590"," know"
"12737610","12747690"," I mean, it's going to be amazing to see all these cars driving around What"
"12747690","12754110"," I heard people were being saved delivery amounts and they were either agreeing or non-agreeing to"
"12754110","12760670"," take delivery at The people that are taking delivery do what their price points, but I don't know"
"12760670","12765250"," what their people say are I had to pay more money to stay in my desk for more money at"
"12765250","12768910"," one point I mean one of the passing lot one of them does not look like the other, it's the"

"12829750","12834030"," off whatever apprehensive he had from yesterday into the event at this point Is that it?"
"12845050","12849310"," We had it on, we had the entire day on the off and on from the day but I missed"
"12849310","12857430"," a lot of the full interview I just got that three minute segment at one point yesterday I just love"
"12857430","12862470"," it that he started his interview where he's blessed Thank you everyone, thanks for coming to the"

"13220420","13228260"," Yeah I was talking about 48 volt electronics means that the wiring can be way thinner."
"13228560","13235700"," So you know 12 volt you got to double the wire to carry the same the same amperage. "
"13236000","13240040"," You go down to the 48 volt and you can make really thin wire."
"13240040","13247940"," So you can send you can send most of the controls around the car through like you said ethernet."
"13248420","13257060"," You probably know that too but I actually know the difference from watching a video that was done"
"13257060","13262980"," by Munro where they were talking about the volt savings of going to 48 volts. "

"13931630","13934410"," Okay, okay, okay, okay. "
"13934570","13934770"," All right."
"13934830","13934950"," All right."
"13935010","13936990"," So here's the expectations for tomorrow. "
"13937610","13938930"," Two key points."
"13940630","13946690"," Normally we sell the first, okay, but the first falls on a Friday this year."
"13947730","13952850"," There is a high probability that we trade 4,600 tomorrow. "
"13953930","13955050"," Isn't that crazy?"
"13955050","13956250"," But get ready."
"13956610","13958570"," We are already at right now."
"13958790","13963830"," Already at the close trading 456, right?"
"13964070","13966390"," What do we add on SPX into the close?"
"13970330","13971010"," Oh, man. "
"13971130","13972770"," We got to check SPX is closing price."
"13974870","13975590"," Hold on."
"13975710","13975930"," Hold on. "
"13980220","13986200"," So closing price on SPX 4567."
"13986200","13993340"," Now that would mean that we need momentum to get up into that 6,000 or the secret magic hand"
"13993340","13996520"," to print those calls on SPX tomorrow."
"13996740","13999960"," So there is a possibility that we could trade that tomorrow. "
"14000360","14001600"," Let's take a look really quick."
"14001780","14006800"," Let's switch over to the trigger screen before we hang up right here and just take a look at spy"
"14006800","14008060"," after the bell."
"14008060","14011100"," And let's take a look. "
"14011260","14013040"," Look at that beast over there."
"14013320","14014300"," Boom, right?"
"14015140","14015440"," Boom."
"14016780","14018860"," Now the one thing that I will say is this. "
"14019860","14023160"," We are bullish even if we pull back, right?"
"14023440","14024580"," Whoo, whoop, whoop, whoop, down here."
"14025140","14028140"," We are bullish to trade that 4,600."
"14028740","14036380"," So if you think we're going to 4,600 as long as we hold 455, 26, we might get a"
"14036380","14037580"," shot at it tomorrow. "
"14038860","14039900"," So that's crazy."
"14040280","14041540"," I mean, that's absolutely crazy."
"14041880","14044500"," Absolutely, absolutely crazy. "
"14045840","14048160"," Do I ever steer you guys wrong out there?"
"14048280","14049840"," I don't fucking steer you guys wrong."
"14050240","14051780"," Definitely don't steer you guys wrong."
"14052880","14054640"," Neo ripped into the close. "
"14057570","14059610"," Yeah, you guys, they're holding off."
"14059790","14063650"," They like hold their cards into the closing bell, right?"
"14063650","14066850"," And then they like surprise, motherfucker."
"14069310","14071550"," Do I think we pull back overnight?"
"14072750","14074330"," You guys want to look at ES really quick?"
"14074510","14074790"," We can. "
"14075530","14077310"," Do I think we pull back overnight?"
"14077490","14078930"," My one concern here is this."
"14079730","14080710"," All right, you guys ready?"
"14082570","14092570"," Every time we get to 4550 dealers or incentives, every time we get to 4550 and SPX dealers are"
"14092570","14096030"," incentivized to sell spoos."
"14096430","14100130"," So in the overnight, I'm going to expect weakness in spoos. "
"14100350","14106190"," But once the Europeans wake up and then you got the 4am crowd, if they continue to run this up"
"14106190","14111970"," tomorrow, we could wake up tomorrow, like at 4600 and then slowly bleed down into tomorrow."
"14112370","14115010"," That is a possibility, but this is wild."
"14115010","14118710"," The one thing I will say to you though, again, is the first you should expect. "
"14119430","14121950"," You should expect some kind of a slow rundown."
"14122370","14128030"," If we opened tomorrow at 46D, I would expect to sell the news on the bell tomorrow, right on the"
"14128030","14128450"," bell tomorrow."
"14131190","14132910"," I'd be trading futures on that shit. "
"14133910","14136370"," Let me show you guys a futures chart really quick."
"14137250","14140890"," So if you guys want to trade this in the overnight, I'm going to, you guys can take a screenshot"
"14140890","14142150"," of this or come back."
"14144710","14146190"," Wrong ES, hold on here. "
"14146670","14147430"," That's ever source."
"14149470","14152450"," I'm going to leave you guys with this chart in the overnight."
"14153550","14156030"," And your target is 4600. "
"14156550","14157710"," So I'm going to leave this."
"14157830","14159950"," You have a bull cross right here with a success."
"14160350","14161890"," You have a, what do you call it here?"
"14162050","14167990"," You have a three trigger, you have a one, two, three and a half bull cross here. "
"14168730","14172190"," So target 4600, target 4600 and ES."
"14172190","14180870"," If there's a pullback, if you don't want to jump on it right here, look for 456465."
"14181490","14184870"," That's where I'd be a buyer right here with stops underneath. "
"14185370","14185570"," Okay."
"14185730","14190690"," I'd put the stops underneath 455883."
"14191150","14195450"," But if we can hold this into tomorrow, it's definitely possible. "
"14196810","14201270"," When we're fucking close up here, these dealers are going to try to sell right into that."
"14201590","14202910"," That's 4580."
"14203090","14205370"," We're 20 points away from 4600. "
"14205810","14209430"," 20 points away from 4600 on ES right now."
"14209630","14211110"," So we're goddamn close."
"14211430","14212890"," We're real close right now. "
"14214610","14215610"," It's close."
"14216470","14218430"," We're so top picking right here."
"14219450","14221170"," I'd want to be a seller. "
"14221510","14222450"," I'm going to be honest with you guys."
"14222450","14224670"," I'd want to be a fucking seller up here in ES."
"14225350","14226630"," I'm going to be honest with you guys. "
"14226850","14232170"," It might run over you for like 10, 20, 30 points, but I would be a seller on ES up"
"14232170","14232390"," here."
"14232790","14234730"," If not, if not now, then later."
"14237410","14237810"," Goddamn. "
"14238390","14238830"," All right."
"14239170","14240290"," Please do me a solid."
"14240470","14244670"," Please try to click the like button on a Twitch. "
"14244750","14248990"," Please try to click the like button on YouTube and do me a solid."
"14249130","14250010"," I got to ask you guys a favor."
"14250290","14250450"," Okay. "
"14251150","14251950"," Do me a solid."
"14252410","14256850"," Whoever's still here, please get on Twitter and just be like, either follow me on Twitter so I can"
"14256850","14261730"," follow you back or at least say something like, hey, you know, you got to watch the stock market"
"14261730","14264670"," show with Captain Jim James and put my handle on there or something like that."
"14265170","14268190"," I'm not asking for any money, any tips, any donations or anything like that. "
"14268330","14270750"," Just try to get the word out there as people see this show every day."
"14271170","14272870"," I appreciate all of you being here with me."
"14273230","14274550"," I want you guys to remember something right. "
"14274710","14276930"," This show is predicated upon you making money."
"14277290","14278030"," Nothing else."
"14278270","14279010"," That's what it's here for. "
"14279010","14283950"," Well, community and for you to become a better trader and investor to make some money."
"14284150","14286830"," So be careful on Tesla."
"14287110","14291770"," If they roll this market at any point, say tomorrow, whatever Tesla could go with the market. "
"14292010","14297930"," So with all this exuberance, we'll come in after like a hangover and stuff like that."
"14298070","14299110"," I'm long Tesla right now."
"14299230","14303750"," So I have to either protect that shit on the open tomorrow or I wind up having to sell it"
"14303750","14305790"," before 9pm tonight. "
"14305790","14307970"," So I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow."
"14307970","14309850"," I appreciate you guys showing up today."
"14310090","14311730"," I'll see you guys tomorrow, baby. "
"14312150","14312510"," Whoo!"
"14312990","14313970"," I'm fucking dude."
"14314130","14317250"," So I can't believe that I'm in this event and I didn't fucking..."
"14317250","14318730"," I'm so frustrated."
"14319490","14320190"," I'm not frustrated. "
"14320590","14322010"," Like in the back of my mind, I'm like..."
"14322010","14323290"," I'm like, if that..."
"14323290","14326750"," I was like, I'm like, if that Tesla event wasn't on, I know I would have rode calls up under"
"14326750","14327110"," that bell."
"14327350","14330030"," So I missed out on some real money there, but whatever."
"14330310","14330550"," It's fine. "
