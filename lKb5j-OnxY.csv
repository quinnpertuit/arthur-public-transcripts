"877230","882710"," So I mean we we have like bull crosses or bear planes bull planes Some other stuff, but it's a"
"882710","883790"," very simplified version."

"920760","926180"," Okay, you guys want to be reading that white paper there, okay And i'm going to kind of explain it"
"926180","932920"," you more complicated version of it So yesterday in stream I had said to people that are watching"
"932920","939060"," are you going to wait for the confirmation for the role And they were like Nah play the bear music"
"939060","943240"," and i'm like you sure because we don't want to play it too early People didn't care and i'm like"
"943240","950870"," no matter fact there's some great uh, there's some hilarious comments on twitch about it We like to"
"950870","959980"," play it early and I was like this is fucking hilarious now The white and the red line right There"
"959980","967520"," are two kinds of crosses on every time frame daily for our one hour 15 minute five minute one"
"967520","977360"," minute charts And you'll see these crosses Kind of like that Kind"
"977360","983560"," of like this, okay, this would be a bull plane So why do we be looking for these?"
"983820","985840"," Okay, that's a bull plane right there. "
"985960","998020"," See the white line crossing up and over the red line Okay, and then price Coming up Coming"
"998020","1008000"," back for confirmation And on that recheck, okay, and we'll show you this right here On"
"1008000","1017920"," that recheck, not this trade here That's a no But on this check right here, there's a very"
"1017920","1026859"," high percentage time Probability of you can enter that trade and it's going to pay you a lot of"
"1026859","1036060"," fucking money And that's a bull plane For a bear plane It's the opposite right I'm going to show it"
"1036060","1046720"," to you right here on the on the side screen You'd see it right here You"
"1046720","1052520"," would see this cross right here Do you see this cross what look my cursor is right here?"
"1052600","1058000"," Okay, I want you to see this Now yesterday in the middle of the day We were creating one of"
"1058000","1058980"," these crosses yesterday."
"1059180","1069100"," We're just starting it Now This is kind of no-man's land in here."
"1069720","1080000"," Okay, so this is like a no-go zone for bears This is a no-go zone for bulls No "
"1080000","1086280","-go no-go This is a this is a huge place in here where bulls and bears buyers and sellers"
"1087120","1097620"," Get rekt I mean rekt They enter too early Or they're not trading each"
"1097620","1104280"," leg Like trade that leg trade that leg trade that trade that leg So my point here to you is"
"1104280","1113300"," that Uh There's different there's different stages in a either a bull plane or a bear plane And you"
"1113300","1118880"," you can only take each each leg If you're a day trader trading a one-minute chart you can take"
"1118880","1124000"," that trade for like five minutes Two minutes one minute you're in you're out you're in you're out"
"1126940","1137680"," But for most traders, this is the zone of doom in here And"
"1137680","1144180"," depending upon the time frame that you're looking at You don't really need to be calling We're"
"1144180","1149880"," going to crash or not in here from most of you Because these trends on higher time frames last for"
"1149880","1159200"," a longer period of time One day two days a week a month believe it or not Multi-day multi "
"1159200","1164380","-week time frames, so you don't need to be the guy going Ah, this is the top right here. "
"1164500","1170660"," We fucking nailed it whoo-hoo because they guarantee the other nine times you got it wrong They'll"
"1170660","1177080"," always be that voice that they got it right But for you as a trader trying to make money Nobody"
"1177080","1183800"," gives a fuck about your internet cred You might think that they do but they don't For you, it's you"
"1183800","1190960"," making money that matters the most So just the just the day trading chart of a five-minute chart"
"1192920","1196800"," Maybe you're up here going to be in a bogo or a bear go and I just sold the top"
"1196800","1203580"," whoo-hoo To me, I think that's too risky of a trade where we are right now I am not"
"1203580","1204920"," a fan of that trade right here."
"1205000","1210280"," Maybe you are maybe you can trade a one-minute chart for this stuff But for me at least I"
"1210280","1212620"," still think it's a risky trade."
"1213020","1223570"," As a matter of fact, we were in this similar situation yesterday So"
"1223570","1233430"," you've got your red line right here You've got your white line right here When I"
"1233430","1241050"," say you have to wait for confirmation Actually started right here Start with the red You get your"
"1241050","1246650"," bleed down You're like, oh, yeah, we're super boat bearish. "
"1246910","1253990"," Oh, yeah, right And then what happens is you you will see a green bar come back up usually like"
"1253990","1260550"," 90% of the time It's right back up here And this is when I use that I just want"
"1260550","1265290"," to use that like head dunking thing where I'm like you let them breathe right bull's or bears"
"1265290","1270470"," bullish or bears cross You pull them up, let them breathe a little bit and drown them again, right?"
"1272210","1276850"," So you get that bleed off you're then looking for this trade here, right?"
"1278450","1281450"," Remember when I say to you guys sometimes, oh, look, liquidation break, right?"
"1282370","1284550"," Take a liquidation break to the upside, right?"
"1285630","1295490"," You're looking for that Still not in the trade You You're then looking for these red bars"
"1295490","1301930"," back down below the five minute right here to the five minute on one 29 Once you get that break"
"1303110","1309430"," You're looking for that last rejection there When you get that last rejection, that's when you're"
"1309430","1315730"," going to get your cross in here And this is where the money trade is down here This is the"
"1315730","1316670"," bloodbath trade."
"1317070","1318530"," This is the capitulation trade."
"1318670","1323090"," It might bounce back up come back down That yellow line will come down here and it'll follow it all"
"1323090","1330570"," the way down to the depths of hell Take a three stage trade one two and three in here Is"
"1330570","1336950"," where everyone loses their money The two early calling a down move or even an up move if this was"
"1336950","1344910"," in reverse so yeah, you can take That part of the trade you can take that part of the trade"
"1345410","1351390"," But then your real trade is like you're waiting for that blood the green up here and that's the"
"1351390","1359270"," capitulation part of the trade So if you want to be a high profitability trader It's a multi-stage"
"1359270","1366690"," trade And the worst part about this trade here is this If you're on a higher time frame like let's"
"1366690","1376430"," say 15 minutes You've got even more time to take it on on an hour same thing If you're looking"
"1376430","1383850"," for like the safest trades this is an hour this is an hour trend right You can this is an"
"1383850","1390570"," hour trend if you're like well even just right now cap I prefer higher time frames You're still"
"1390570","1400550"," looking for the same trade Even if it takes one or two or three days For something"
"1400550","1408730"," like this right And Then boom you get your trade right there that's when you get like a trend"
"1408730","1416990"," change Sometimes it'll take a day sometimes I'll take a two but on an hourly chart Wherever this"
"1416990","1426950"," takes place You can then enter that long you know multi-day bear position If you see this curl over"
"1426950","1434010"," on an hourly chart in one day You know that's going to be two three days of down right With"
"1434010","1439330"," confidence you can say hey i'm fucking bearish here man on an hour we're below we're below the bear"
"1439330","1444890"," plane on a hourly chart Uh, we probably are good to go for like a day or two to the"
"1444890","1451330"," downside three days to the downside for our chart fucking week Daily chart how about weeks and"
"1451330","1461210"," months possibly So depending upon your time frame You're looking for that How bearish"
"1461210","1471160"," are we how long we bearish That kind of stuff Right now i'm pretty bearish right"
