"2890","3750"," Alright, let's see here."
"3850","4670"," Can you guys hear me?"
"4850","5570"," Sounds like you can."
"8450","9670"," A multi-stream here. "
"15620","16840"," Let me just second here."
"17580","19440"," Yeah, you guys, am I back up and running for you guys?"
"19840","20460"," Give me just a second here."
"20580","21800"," I got a bunch of stuff I got to do in the background. "
"23560","25560"," I just want to make sure I got the stream up and running."
"26980","29600"," There's no, no, like, as least lag as possible."
"31320","31700"," Pain streams. "
"40100","41500"," A couple of things I got to do here in the background."
"75760","76180"," I'm here."
"76440","79440"," I just, you know, I'm doing a few things in the background so you guys don't have me talking. "
"79440","81720"," It's only because I got some details."
"82480","86380"," He keeps kind of like a clunky."
"87000","89040"," Even with streamlabs, it's still kind of clunky. "
"91620","94260"," There's still things I have to do every morning."
"104760","105280"," Save."
"107000","108720"," I'm going to post this really quick. "
"109240","109680"," Post that."
"110460","110560"," Close."
"129810","130690"," Part two. "
"139860","142100"," Send that so we can get back."
"142200","143540"," Everybody else back up in here right now."
"146620","152360"," The daily trigger is down here at 409.73. I got this right here. "
"153080","153820"," Somewhere in here."
"156080","156720"," Here's your pivot."
"157000","158900"," Here's your hourly trigger above here. "
"159100","159700"," Three trigger cluster."
"160660","162340"," You can see right off the bell this morning."
"163200","164340"," Sorry, I couldn't be here. "
"164440","165540"," Well, let me start off with it."
"165740","167340"," I apologize not being able to be here this morning."
"167780","170100"," You can see right here on a five-minute chart. "
"170760","173160"," Big old bear cross right here, bear plane."
"173360","177480"," Hopefully somebody said something about this inside of the stream."
"178720","180580"," We're breaking through the pivot right now. "
"180600","181460"," Close up."
"183980","184740"," Previous lows."
"185060","186780"," We have two previous lows back here. "
"186840","189360"," We've got one to tag here at 41027."
"189360","196500"," And then the low from the previous day down here at 409.96. And the daily trigger is kind of"
"196500","197480"," hanging out down here."
"201720","202720"," Just a second here. "
"203560","223550"," I want to"
"223550","224790"," trade too, so hold on."
"236540","238180"," I want to trade with you guys."
"241940","246240"," I sold some calls on the open this morning, but I was at a meeting, a conference call this morning. "
"246380","248060"," I couldn't sell that open with you."
"250220","255040"," It's like the third time this week that I haven't been able to sell the open because I'm like, you"
"255040","258200"," start the stream and it's like, I can't monitor the first half an hour."
"258380","259300"," I can't really monitor. "
"260180","261680"," Well, I'm blabbing and all that kind of stuff."
"262380","264560"," So Friday came up open this morning."
"264700","265860"," It was a gorgeous open this morning. "
"266440","267620"," Hopefully you took profit on the open."
"267780","269620"," You know that my take on this."
"269760","271460"," I think I said it in the stream earlier this morning. "
"272140","273720"," Each trade is a new trade, right?"
"275080","276680"," Each trade is a new is a new trade."
"276860","282320"," I try to close my calls on the bell, take the money and run and renegotiate the next trade."
"282800","285020"," You can see we had this consolidation here. "
"285040","289960"," You can see that we had a bear our bear plane form in a five minute, which is quite bearish"
"289960","290200"," normally."
"290580","295680"," And then we also broke underneath the hourly trigger the moment that we get like so when we get"
"295680","298760"," underneath a one minute of five minute an hourly."
"298760","305200"," It becomes even more bearish and more pronounced more explosive to the downside or the upside. "
"305660","312220"," So if you turn this chart upside down and you would have this would become a bull plane, right?"
"312760","316120"," And if you break through on the hourly, pretend this is upside down, right?"
"316340","319320"," Then you check it right up here and it's confirmed."
"320020","324400"," You know you're going to make your way down and right now we are heading down to S one right"
"324400","324740"," now."
"326420","330260"," We just traded four ten seventy six on the five minute. "
"332940","336940"," Almost near this four ten fifty eight and S one is probably going to continue to go down here."
"337060","338080"," I haven't looked yet though."
"338520","339180"," So I'm just getting a moment. "
"339300","342240"," There's probably what that red bar is down there on book map."
"342780","343420"," How y'all doing?"
"343540","344360"," Happy Friday everybody."
"344480","345200"," Hope you're all doing well. "
"346040","347920"," I gotta take I gotta go to the potty too."
"347960","350000"," I didn't take a potty break after this conference call."
"350340","353440"," I just I literally just like I get to get the stream up and running for everybody. "
"355980","360240"," Do you mean just a minute here and let me work on some stuff in the background here."
"370920","372260"," Hope you're all doing well today."
"373240","374300"," Happy Friday dudes. "
"374680","376860"," It's a long ass week like for me specifically."
"377960","383520"," I found this week to be extremely extremely long."
"383740","384920"," I was just like oh. "
"387060","393040"," It was brutal for me."
"393200","394040"," I couldn't do it."
"394040","401620"," Like the slowness of the market the past week was just like you know you're like in the worst part"
"401620","402500"," is you know where it's going. "
"402500","405040"," You're like it's going up slowly."
"405680","408220"," It's going down slowly."
"415750","421650"," So this whole week has just been like it's like watching a Zamboni go back and forth on the ice. "
"421650","426850"," You're just like we're going up we're going up and then like two hours later you're like we tagged"
"426850","429190"," it or overnight we tagged it."
"429190","432070"," And then the next day we're like it's going down it's going down."
"433610","435610"," It's like eleven thirty. "
"437090","439870"," It's going down it's twelve thirty."
"440630","444930"," It's going down it's one thirty you're like shit."
"447630","451570"," Like three hours later it's like a SpongeBob episode. "
"458330","459910"," I don't know remove that one."
"460490","470430"," A lot of I've got something like I'm constantly like putting people on my tweet deck and"
"470430","474250"," then removing them for my tweet deck."
"476050","479250"," Like I like them on like so like it's weird like my Twitter. "
"479970","485830"," Twitter is like a cool thing like like you got like people that you like to see once a week"
"485830","487810"," once a month once a day."
"488450","492990"," And then you've got like so I've got this tweet deck set up for day trading right so you're like."
"500860","510280"," You want like day trader so they can let you guys know about here I'm going to add this guy"
"510280","510660"," in here. "
"511980","517200"," You're like whether it doesn't matter if it's news it's like so I try to put like some news feeds"
"517200","518919"," up on tweet deck."
"519640","524020"," No they don't want me on tweet deck what I want me on tweet deck for."
"526100","530620"," Press return. "
"536320","537080"," There we go."
"545270","550590"," So when it's a slow day I can read off people that are tweeting a market important information."
"555630","557930"," And like Walter Bloomberg went offline yesterday. "
"559330","561930"," So I was like to read his stuff to you guys on stream."
"564930","570190"," So okay so if you're if you're a bear right you're still in charge right now if you're selling"
"570190","574710"," right here you've been selling since the open you're still in charge right now we're teeing off on"
"574710","575470"," the six EMA."
"576810","582030"," And even if we squeeze higher here at any point you're still in control up to the four twelve"
"582030","582550"," eleven. "
"584390","589390"," To go lower believe it or not we go look around some stuff here in the background."
"590110","594450"," So VIX is consolidating right now we'll take a look at the VIX real quick."
"602750","606710"," Here's the VIX right now on the daily right on the VIX. "
"606710","614390"," Just starting to get bullish on the hourly on the VIX hasn't been able if you look here it like"
"614390","616910"," just hasn't been able to get over the hourly right."
"617830","624090"," So it's just been struggling it's been rejected off the daily as well the one the five minutes is"
"624090","625890"," becoming bearish on VIX."
"626310","633910"," But even so there's this there's this nasty consolidation down here and you know can the can the"
"633910","636250"," VIX go higher on a Friday right is the question. "
"636710","641530"," Remember yesterday in the close I'm like the one thing I don't like here is the VIX being so low."
"642270","649870"," We got the VIX down to 1643 1638 retesting the previous lows we see what happens when that happens"
"649870","655090"," we blast up into the hourly trigger will that happen again today I don't know what we're going to"
"655090","656170"," find out if it's going to go up."
"656170","665790"," But as long as price stays above on the VIX above 1679 we'll get that move higher to 1790 that's"
"665790","671270"," at least the hope there is another little checkpoint right here at 1728. "
"671830","678070"," So there's two places for you to keep your eyes on 1728 you can see his previous high here previous"
"678070","681010"," high right here and this line right here is important to that."
"683070","692590"," So trade in 1701 look for 1728 as a sign post and then look for that's"
"692590","701570"," 1793 on the VIX right now VIX looks bullish which it's saying which signals more down for the"
"701570","701930"," market."
"702690","708270"," We know though that sometimes it doesn't quite make it to the daily at least for right now the"
"708270","710990"," expectation is that the VIX is going to at least come up to 1790. "
"717890","730300"," What does that translate to hold on a second here what did I just do hold on"
"730300","740940"," I just fucked everything up hold on a second here well how does"
"740940","744600"," that translate to the spy or S&P 500."
"748200","751880"," Right in here there's a couple of things you should be looking at here's that early trigger above"
"751880","758160"," it's at 412-44 and while it consolidates that can mean that the spy can go up here or even"
"758160","763560"," up here and then come back down and tag that 409-60 on the downside okay."
"764500","771740"," So there's the spy for you in the one minute chart and the VIX is trying to consolidate for that"
"771740","772600"," move higher. "
"774440","781460"," So here's your hourly trigger above you get a quick squeeze on the spy and then hope for that roll"
"781460","788820"," back down to finally tag S1 or even possibly that daily trigger at 490-409-73."
"791120","797020"," The hourly though I'll give something to the bulls if you wanted a place to buy a dip it's getting"
"797020","799020"," kind of long in the tooth on spy at least."
"799760","809660"," Now the hourly is down to minus 14 minus 15 I still would like"
"809660","818420"," to see the hourly velocity lower like minus 25 minus 25 minus 50 be awesome. "
"818820","825200"," For a capitulation move to the downside would be great it's got more high probability by the dip so"
"825200","830520"," I'm not I'm going to dip by here personally when I do come in when I am trying to do"
"830520","831440"," up by a dip down here."
"832720","838120"," When I am trying to buy a dip down there or say hey this is bottom something like that I'm"
"838120","843780"," looking for two things I'm looking for the hourly velocity to be like minus 25 minus 50."
"845560","853660"," I'm looking for price to do some consolidation bullshit down here I'm looking for the white line to"
"853660","854500"," flatten out. "
"856120","866040"," I'm looking for the red line to get underneath and I'm looking for price to get it back above at"
"866040","872620"," least right like price to get above this is a five minute chart price to get above and start making"
"872620","874700"," its way up like getting caught in this bullshit."
"875420","879900"," You can win money like in a one minute chart we can win money doing this stuff but on a"
"879900","884520"," five minute chart it's just a matter of it's a matter of waiting game right bears are in charge"
"884520","887880"," right now that they are in charge is not no no two ways about it."
"888580","892580"," So it's not really like hey let's buy a dip or let's let's make some money here. "
"893140","898320"," You can catch a bounce and do a five minute trade like this here's a 15 minute trade right here"
"898320","903060"," one two and three right so one will show us on a one minute chart."
"905350","909630"," You know it's like yesterday we were buying dips like quick dipping rips and here's one right here"
"909630","916530"," bam quick by the dip and then it rolls right there's another one that rolls on a one minute chart"
"916530","920050"," so if you're going to like buy a dip all day long this isn't the place is it."
"920350","927570"," You kind of need that you need that bottoming process or capitulation move or a level of some kind"
"927570","932550"," that you can buy a bounce off of and truly to go even hot to go higher you need to"
"932550","933070"," have that. "
"933070","939170"," That consolidation in the in the in the price to be over that one minute white line we're not"
"939170","942570"," seeing that right now right now right that white line is way up here at four twelve oh one."
"943250","950630"," So without seeing that line down there there is no dip buy for a for a for a bull."
"953090","958850"," No dip lot no dip for a bull to buy here so this is like sell sell sell keep selling"
"958850","962370"," and I will wait to see if you want to really buy it up here. "
"962370","967350"," You're looking for the you're looking for a vix to bounce off the daily trigger and you're looking"
"967350","968950"," for spite of bounce off the daily trigger."
"977650","980830"," It's a beautiful sell job right here I wish I'd be able to trade this shit."
"981450","987130"," It's like gorgeous look at that bam big old cross right at four thirteen oh one you got the cross. "
"987830","993290"," And it's been what what's the price there for thirteen oh one and right now price is four ten"
"993290","996450"," eighty one so it's a kick ass sell job down there."
"1000030","1001750"," And we'll look at Tesla today as well."
"1002370","1004270"," We're gonna I'll try out Tesla for you. "
"1010980","1012840"," And I've read any of the news I've read nothing."
"1034130","1039910"," Are you guys all on."
"1045500","1048160"," I'm not reading your chat I'm starting to start to read your chat right now. "
"1051600","1053060"," Thanks have a good on Twitch too."
"1058120","1060680"," What are my thoughts on zero date VIX."
"1061000","1063940"," I don't trade it anymore I used to trade it I'm trying to bother anymore. "
"1064580","1069180"," These trades zero date VIX and I'd go in there and it would go the direction I wanted it to"
"1069180","1071260"," go in and they just they just vacuum up on the premium."
"1072040","1073440"," I express it through other trades."
"1074400","1082140"," I've been much more successful expressing VIX long time long term VIX trades I like I like buying"
"1082140","1083540"," VIX like the underlying. "
"1083540","1092060"," And then I like to trade VIX on high or like high IO."
"1094200","1098280"," Now farther out in time but as far as zero date VIX I don't mess with it."
"1098880","1099380"," I used to. "
"1100940","1104880"," That's like a widow maker just like netty gas like that that'll end your life."
"1105420","1107680"," You just get like throw money at the money gods in my view."
"1109720","1110980"," A good question though. "
"1115320","1117120"," Hey Winky welcome back brother."

"1368740","1371900"," So I'm assuming that some of you think that we're going to blast through this right."
"1372680","1375220"," I'm assuming that some of you guys like bloodbath into Monday."
"1375920","1378240"," We've done that three times four times this week. "
"1379660","1382880"," One two three three times."
"1384900","1386860"," We've had three dip just this week."
"1386860","1397620"," Well we've had more than that we had we had what how many we had like raced"
"1397620","1400960"," up here came back down boom by the dip. "
"1401040","1410820"," One two three do we make it four or is this finally the one is this"
"1410820","1416760"," finally we unclench is this the unclench I doubt it I'm going to be honest with you."
"1418320","1423920"," I think you're crazy if you think we unclench before I think you're crazy I'll be honest with you I"
"1423920","1425440"," think you're absolutely I can be wrong."
"1426280","1434180"," I'm wrong a lot so do I think we unclench right in before before Opex fuck no"
"1434180","1438860"," they want to print their shit man. "
"1441920","1444420"," All these banks are going to want to print their shit."
"1445400","1450400"," So as I guess is the question becomes is the print at 400 or 410."
"1452020","1453700"," That would be the bigger question right. "
"1454460","1455480"," Well we know that."
"1457960","1463600"," Let's go back here let's go back to four one."
"1468240","1471240"," So what we do we came back in this Opex we blast it up. "
"1474860","1478300"," Spent the entire month of April."
"1479980","1481740"," To right here."
"1482220","1484320"," My cursor is right there. "
"1485220","1487540"," Shaqing printed mopex."
"1489220","1492400"," Well end of month they printed mopex."
"1493780","1495580"," I believe back here. "
"1496680","1497360"," Shaqing."
"1497880","1499060"," A little bit of weakness."
"1500320","1500860"," And then boom. "
"1503240","1507360"," So do I expect going into next week that we're going to bloodbath into it."
"1507480","1508580"," No it's probably higher."
"1510120","1514140"," It's probably higher next week likely higher next week. "
"1516460","1520400"," Let me maybe you're right maybe they have lower expectations for this month."
"1521420","1524060"," You get an Opex and just blood down an Opex."
"1525360","1529060"," But I'm not going to I'm not going to rely upon that I'm looking for here. "
"1529080","1531360"," I know you guys like let's close all this shit down here cap."
"1533980","1535260"," I'm more like yeah."
"1537120","1539460"," By dip by dip something like that. "
"1541340","1543460"," There or there into mopex."
"1543840","1545820"," Maybe we go to 400 maybe that's the plan right."
"1547260","1549840"," Go into into mopex. "
"1550020","1551780"," We print like 400 or something."
"1551980","1553000"," That was the plan all along."
"1554020","1555120"," But I kind of doubt it. "
"1555300","1560720"," We're going to be looking for a dip by down here on the daily trigger."
"1560720","1565080"," We'll find out if that if we'll find out if these zones down or if these are demand."
"1565940","1568140"," If this demand down here is real or fake. "
"1570140","1571720"," This is where the bears wrap it up."
"1571840","1572340"," Take profit."
"1572340","1572880"," We bounce. "
"1573960","1578460"," Fridays sometimes we'll go down here on a Friday and we'll just kind of like pitter over to the"
"1578460","1579020"," clothes too."
"1579200","1583380"," So the date that like the trade on today might actually be dead too."
"1583440","1584300"," That's the last point. "
"1584920","1586260"," Even if we get down here."
"1587140","1588280"," The trade could be dead."
"1588520","1590320"," And there's one other thing here too for a Friday. "
"1591040","1592360"," If we go down here."
"1593480","1594920"," We get the VIX up."
"1595300","1600860"," It might be nice for the market to close even lower just to get that VIX high enough. "
"1602340","1606580"," So if there's a relief valve right some kind of a relief valve on VIX."
"1607180","1617020"," That target down below would be 408.90. 406.31. I don't think you get the 406.31"
"1617020","1622340"," but like that like that that bloodbath trade you get down to that daily and then womb."
"1623380","1629480"," Right there or you get in here and then it just pitters down into that Friday close at S2. "
"1629880","1634380"," So 408.90 would be the expectation for more."
"1634560","1638960"," If there is more downside it's down there at 408.90 would be the expectation on the rest of the"
"1638960","1639180"," day."
"1639660","1641680"," And you're already seeing the dip buyers step in right now. "
"1659040","1660260"," Let's see if they do something here."
"1673200","1675840"," It looks like is financial juice down for today?"

"1961090","1963170"," There might be like a five minute trade here."
"1967590","1969070"," There's a one minute chart right now."
"1970210","1971610"," That's what I'm looking at right here. "
"1980820","1982520"," I'll need it to proof itself first."
"1982740","1985300"," Can't take it unless we get above right here."
"1986000","1989580"," You need to see price trade higher. "
"1991080","1991560"," Bounce."
"1994460","1998040"," And then come up here and fail on this pivot right here somewhere."
"1999760","2001040"," See that presents itself. "
"2001200","2002400"," Dozens will keep going down."
"2003800","2005060"," There's that daily trigger."
"2006760","2016060"," Right there. "
"2026040","2027360"," Nice chart right there."
"2040490","2041810"," I'm not buying it here."
"2041990","2044070"," VIX is still above its cluster here. "
"2044590","2046450"," Careful of a reversal straight to the downside."
"2048449","2049969"," Careful of this bloodbath here."
"2050090","2051670"," It's like capitulation move to the downside. "
"2052909","2053389"," It's nice though."
"2053489","2055190"," It's only 12 o'clock here."
"2057090","2069139"," Four twelve"
"2069139","2069800"," C's. "
"2073500","2078340"," There's no trade on the options chain right now."
"2080400","2082360"," I don't see a trade on the options chain."
"2085639","2088100"," So from here to here. "
"2089340","2091460"," Somewhere in here like a four eleven C."
"2092400","2093500"," Seventy nine cents."
"2093800","2095500"," I'm like I don't want to pay."
"2095600","2096660"," I want to pay like fifty cents. "
"2097640","2098420"," We'll go there."
"2098420","2099480"," I just don't want to pay to play."
"2105660","2107380"," There's likely like a failure in here. "
"2107600","2111640"," So if you get up in here they drop it right back down on you."
"2113700","2116180"," Squeeze nine out trading four eleven thirteen."
"2127000","2129040"," John's like fuck that I'm buying that dip with you. "
"2133560","2135560"," Oh and yes I'd buy it right there."
"2135940","2137620"," I'd buy this fuck out of this on a yes."
"2141520","2143140"," It's even if it goes down here. "
"2143260","2144720"," It's coming back up one way or another."
"2144720","2145940"," We're likely high probability."
"2167830","2169370"," Zero dates whole another thing. "
"2169510","2171110"," I'm like oh they'll fuck me on this."
"2180060","2180580"," Yeah."
"2183130","2186870"," Did anybody see the did you guys see the did you guys see. "
"2188850","2199380"," Did you guys actually see the bear the bear plane that bear plane and"
"2199380","2201440"," it sucks because they can't show you velocity either."
"2201580","2203360"," When I was like I'm like man I got to show these guys velocity."
"2203960","2209280"," I was thinking what I'd do is then if I ever have to do that again I'm going to leave"
"2209280","2212460"," the velocity chart up so you guys can see if it'll hold or fail. "
"2212720","2213900"," Maybe I'll just do four charts."
"2214120","2218740"," I'll do a VIX velocity and trigger chart a spy velocity and VIX chart."
"2219620","2226300"," I'll do the Weebull chart and then I'll do a square. "
"2226300","2227160"," Like four square."
"2227620","2233020"," It'll be like book map with two velocities on VIX and spy and then the Weebull chart."
"2248920","2253520"," So I'm flat right now. "
"2273700","2275220"," So what are your plans for the weekend."
"2275560","2277020"," I was told that it's Mother's Day."
"2281530","2291330"," Of course I still do the thing where it's like when I was a kid we always made nice things"
"2291330","2300650"," for my mom and my dad would go out and get expensive shit and be like here. "
"2301250","2303430"," Give this to your mom and say you got it for her."
"2306370","2312630"," Because of course moms are I mean they're built I just read the story this scientific paper said"
"2312630","2321890"," that babies release a chemical that"
"2321890","2330330"," changed the behavior of a mom to protective and decrease the"
"2330330","2338710"," protective nature of men and it's off their scalp or something."
"2338710","2342590"," So like if I hold a baby on my like this is kind of fascinating because now when my kids"
"2342590","2347810"," were young I was like so I'd like take them and I'd put them in my shirt. "
"2348770","2353690"," They'd be like butt naked with a little tiny diaper on her on on on them and I let them"
"2353690","2354670"," sleep on my chest."
"2357510","2360830"," And then it get all sweaty and nasty and gross and sticky."
"2361890","2365150"," But it was a kind of a wave as a parent to bond to your kids right. "
"2365150","2371550"," Because your wife carries that baby or woman carries that baby and you have to bond with your child"
"2371550","2373130"," as a dad right."
"2375070","2378970"," And so I'd like have the baby sleeping on my chest to pull the shirt up over the baby and"
"2378970","2380450"," the baby's head be sticking out over here."
"2381090","2385170"," That goes sit inside the rocker like they have these gliders everybody gets like a glider. "
"2386370","2389190"," And so I'd rock in the glider and pass out with the kid."
"2389190","2393530"," I said kid it's my child my baby right."
"2394030","2396510"," And my baby get all sweaty and sticky. "
"2397410","2402730"," But I didn't know that they released the chemical to make you more like they'll make a male be more"
"2402730","2409770"," pretend or less aggressive or something more like docile and a mom more protective of a child."
"2410390","2414830"," So like when I was growing up I remember that my mom this isn't for everybody."
"2414830","2418930"," I know some people have parents like mom didn't do that for me. "
"2419330","2423070"," And dad didn't do that for me or my dad did like everybody has a different experience."
"2423250","2428790"," But my how I grew up my mom was very loving, consoling."
"2431210","2436810"," She protected me she protected me from my father right like my dad had my dad was like that dad"
"2436810","2442970"," that was like high expectations like prodigal son shit like you'll never be good enough you'll"
"2442970","2446190"," never be a man you'll never live up to be better than me. "
"2447210","2451170"," And I don't even if you are you'll never be as good as me right that kind of stuff."
"2451970","2453990"," My expectations are high don't fail me."
"2454050","2459010"," And if you do price now trading above the one end the one minute and this yellow line right here"
"2459010","2463830"," might have a nice five minute trade in here. "
"2465330","2467170"," Talked about this trade a few minutes ago."
"2468190","2469850"," So you know I think that's how I grew up right."
"2470670","2477970"," If I hurt myself my dad was like pick yourself up you know that was drowned once and he was"
"2477970","2482550"," like you're fine in the middle of winter fell through some ice true story. "
"2483990","2490310"," You know my dad was a hard guy on me but that's beside the point."
"2490430","2497330"," This is Mother's Day and my dad on Mother's Day like like different parents I don't care if you're"
"2497330","2502930"," if you have two men raised in the child or two women or men and women or one parent doesn't"
"2502930","2503210"," matter."
"2503770","2509170"," Parents serve different roles either way right parents serve different roles to children. "
"2509710","2517870"," The extended family serves different roles and uncle and aunt a friend the extended family serves"
"2517870","2520190"," roles to a child and they provide different things."
"2520730","2527250"," As a child grows up the child looks towards like maybe your uncle spoils you where your dad doesn't"
"2527250","2532210"," right or your grandmother let's keep special food in the house just for you."
"2533070","2537870"," Or your mom's friend does something that your mom doesn't do for you. "
"2537870","2544570"," So everybody has different roles and a child's upbringing and my my mom or my dad of course my dad"
"2544570","2551830"," would be like well your mom's really nice to she coddles you she loves you."
"2554250","2558850"," So you'd come around and like buy expensive shim be like tell your mom that's from you."
"2562320","2568820"," And my daughters I don't treat my daughters like my like my dad treated me. "
"2569140","2574680"," I think if I think it's good that I don't have sons I probably would fall into that and not"
"2574680","2580740"," into that specific but because I was raised like that it's probably going to be some kind of a"
"2580740","2584180"," chance of that leaking through as a dad right."
"2585180","2589900"," I don't do that my my own daughters I don't know if that's because it's female and male I'm not"
"2589900","2592520"," sure I'm not sure if it's what the reason is."
"2594200","2600160"," But I'm not the person with my daughters that my wife is. "
"2601880","2607660"," And you know my wife is very like loving on my my daughters like I do it on my daughters"
"2607660","2613140"," and stuff but my wife is like dude just so much for my kids that I don't do it on"
"2613140","2615620"," the time to do the time to do it."
"2615960","2623200"," And she is like this mom dude to my kids that's unreal like."

"3378820","3382240"," Hope Dixie hope Dixie goes to the moon the more moon we get in Dixie."
"3382960","3387780"," And the fact that price isn't following on spy is just another opportunity to buy the dip. "
"3389200","3396840"," It'd be really bad right now if a spy price was blasting down with Dixie ripen faces off."
"3397860","3402640"," It's actually a very stable when you see like Dixie ripen faces off and the spies not following"
"3402640","3404100"," price wise that's good."
"3406660","3407860"," That's believe it or not that's bullish. "
"3409880","3415820"," I can Dixie used to go up like a sea here and spy blast down like 30 points."
"3427220","3429040"," Yeah you're saying the bull party is over this week."
"3432020","3432980"," Yeah I don't think so. "
"3435380","3437540"," I don't think so I highly doubt it right now."
"3441600","3445520"," I'm having some faith here in the in the delta hedging."
"3446400","3450700"," I'm assuming that people are going to get super bearish next week on the debt sailing. "
"3451340","3455340"," And we're going to get some counter flows against that trade."
"3459630","3462930"," I think we hit that trade I just don't think it's when everybody thinks it is."
"3463490","3467110"," I think it's too easy. "
"3468550","3469810"," That could be wrong though."
"3472610","3481090"," Nice trading 410.45. Daily trigger down at 409.73. Vicks blasting off right now."
"3481270","3485470"," Vicks trading $17.14 right now. "
"3486050","3490090"," We're looking for a target above a Vicks at $17.94 if possible."

"3512860","3514340"," Yeah still haven't hit. "
"3514620","3518520"," This is the previous low from yesterday the low right before the close."
"3519380","3526820"," And this is the low from 10.30 yesterday morning."
"3527460","3529040"," There's a low from 10.30 yesterday morning. "
"3543040","3557020"," The exact target on the daily is 409.62. 409 "
"3557020","3558620",".62 it's actually lower."
"3559620","3560270"," All right."
"3561440","3563220"," 49.62 right there. "
"3571160","3572640"," So this is S1."
"3573000","3577440"," This is the previous low from like four in the after years something like that."
"3577480","3579160"," This is the 10.30 low. "
"3581620","3586160"," From yesterday prices not seen since yesterday."
"3628740","3633080"," So the call side of this trade is almost dead."
"3633920","3638100"," All the calls that are expiring today were in the last two bands. "
"3638980","3643520"," We've got 220,000 calls that are now 22 cents."
"3643700","3644480"," Those are for 12."
"3646300","3648260"," We need to get those down to like. "
"3649120","3652260"," If it's 16, 20 cents somewhere in there."
"3652780","3655700"," There's one more band of calls at 50 cents."
"3656380","3664260"," The and then above that there's a very small band at $1 and $1.69. Maybe we'll get but get"
"3664260","3665360"," down here a little bit more. "
"3665480","3670220"," We're almost there where all the call value is drained out of the zero date complex."
"3670960","3673240"," Should expect a bounce down here at some point."
"3679620","3680960"," We're getting we're getting close. "
"3681300","3682080"," We're not quite there."
"3682200","3682720"," We're almost there."
"3684040","3699450"," I'd like"
"3699450","3701030"," to see if you want more context. "
"3701030","3702110"," I'd like to see."
"3703650","3705930"," 410 C's right now they're trading for a dollar."
"3706210","3711850"," I'd like to see those at like 50 cents or 35 cents somewhere in there. "
"3711990","3713490"," So 410 C's trading a dollar."
"3713810","3716830"," I'd like to see them lose half their value if possible."
"3717350","3720330"," I don't know if I'll get it, but I want to see them down there. "
"3720410","3722530"," I'd like to see them at like 50 cents something like that."
"3728570","3730990"," Coming into the daily support right now."
"3737400","3739260"," And I want to buy this so bad right now. "
"3740760","3743260"," Like this is a place to start a position right here."
"3747180","3748260"," I'm thinking about it."
"3749780","3751100"," I'm thinking about it right here. "
"3757810","3758750"," All right, fuck it."
"3758790","3759390"," I took a little bit."
"3760870","3763250"," I'm in a 411 C's. "
"3764430","3766870"," I might get rolled down here, so just be careful."
"3770780","3772640"," I'm in some 411 C's here."
"3772720","3773860"," I don't want to see a reversal. "
"3774180","3774720"," Right here."
"3776460","3780940"," I don't want to see usually like what happens is enter early and then we blast down like one last"
"3780940","3781200"," blast."
"3790080","3791720"," So I'll keep my eyes on this trade. "
"3792920","3794960"," This is a half stop straight."
"3806600","3808060"," One minute chart right here."
"3842570","3844490"," And I'm going to have to get out of this fucking trade. "
"3844630","3845510"," It's still not done yet."
"3845830","3847550"," Like the fix is still not done, dude."
"3851130","3852610"," I'm going flat again here. "
"3853730","3854850"," It's still not done."
"3857290","3858690"," Like here, I'm going to show you some."
"3860230","3863190"," If I just exited a trade here, I want to show you guys some. "
"3864050","3866230"," It's like if we squeeze here, I want to show you this."
"3868730","3870010"," Like we can squeeze here."
"3870950","3872150"," But what I want to show you is this. "
"3872730","3878890"," What I don't like about this trade is this right here."
"3878890","3880310"," Like see this shit right here."
"3882070","3884970"," Like watching this cross on the VIX right here. "
"3885110","3886370"," See this white line right here."
"3887770","3890410"," I don't like this white line coming above the hourly."
"3894070","3899010"," So I get out like we'll have like a quick rip and then if price. "
"3900450","3901590"," You can see that."
"3903230","3909090"," If price like bounces on the VIX and just goes up there for that last little bit."
"3910330","3911110"," It's up to that. "
"3911310","3912970"," Like that's seven twenty seven."
"3912970","3915190"," We were showing this early as seventeen twenty eight."
"3916430","3920610"," It'll trap me in for like one more big leg down and truly I'd like to see. "
"3920830","3925070"," I'd like to actually see the VIX up here at at least seventeen ninety three."
"3925570","3930950"," I think would be going to be really good is the VIX at twenty bucks."
"3931570","3934530"," Like if VIX can get twenty twenty seven, it'd be even even happier. "
"3937070","3938930"," There's like this trap in here."
"3940470","3942130"," Oh for bulls so."
"3943470","3947190"," I'm just going to stay flat here and see this and I miss this the cell in there. "
"3947550","3948810"," Let's see other part of this like."
"3950610","3952970"," Like I missed the cell way up on the open."
"3953330","3955950"," So it's not like I'm like it's not like I'm sitting. "
"3957290","3958650"," I mean like show it to this way."
"3959430","3962970"," It's not like I'm sitting puts way up here or even right here."
"3964530","3970050"," As if we do start squeeze and you know it can be just like straight fucking straight up so. "
"3973030","3973590"," Patience."
"3974730","3977250"," I'm going to exude a little patience here."
"3977330","3979530"," I'm hoping for a roll down. "
"3980570","3981670"," Capitulation trade."
"3982770","3983950"," That's what I'm hoping for."
"3984750","3986170"," Then buy that shit right there. "
"3991560","3993640"," What I don't want to do is get caught in there."
"3994900","4003520"," So this be patient cap."
"4016180","4017540"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"4018320","4020780"," Cappy didn't get caught in that trap, did he?"
"4024860","4027380"," You didn't you didn't trap cap in that trade."
"4028100","4028920"," So good."
"4034000","4035980"," I thought you were going to catch me. "
"4036100","4037600"," Oh, you're going to get me by the balls."
"4038280","4039060"," You didn't get me."
"4042960","4047820"," Too fast too fast for the sellers. "
"4054750","4056230"," Gotta be quick, baby."
"4068310","4071460"," Gotta be quick."
"4073500","4077000"," Gonna whack myself in the head and be like brains start working faster. "
"4077760","4078860"," Gotta be quicker than a computer."
"4085020","4086780"," I'm going to look right now, Winky."
"4087060","4088300"," I'm going to check it out right now, brother. "
"4091200","4092260"," Happy Friday, everybody."
"4093120","4097160"," So my question to you is if you have a mom or whether she's here with us or not."
"4098720","4103300"," If you don't have a mom, if you had someone that stood in for mom. "
"4108310","4109850"," Let's see what he's got going on here."
"4132640","4134020"," I like that, Winky."
"4136279","4137420"," You know what we have to do, Winky?"
"4139080","4140399"," You know what we really have to do, Winky?"
"4140840","4142140"," So I have a shit. "
"4142319","4143979"," I have to drop off that CPU still."
"4144880","4147460"," I'm going to go and drop that CPU off today later today."
"4148640","4150800"," And I'll have that set up back on Monday. "
"4151640","4152479"," Do Winky next week."
"4152899","4154920"," I'm going to put a live stream up one of these days next week."
"4155640","4158359"," And you and I are going to check this thing together on a different live stream. "
"4158640","4160020"," We'll like a Google Meet or something."
"4162540","4164560"," Just you and I will just trade the day together alone."
"4166279","4168279"," And we'll just watch the triggers, the alerts. "
"4169080","4170300"," That shit is badass, Winky."
"4172040","4173660"," That shit is badass, bro."
"4177880","4183140"," So, Winky, how I knew that, so earlier, Wink, when I was like, yeah, we have a quick 15 minute"
"4183140","4183500"," trade. "
"4184359","4185180"," But it will fail."
"4185500","4186220"," We knew it would fail."
"4188740","4191240"," We have to look at why we knew that would fail too. "
"4192960","4194080"," I know why it failed."
"4194080","4199520"," But we have to like write the rules for knowing it's like a five minute trade."
"4205340","4206120"," You know what I mean?"
"4215520","4216960"," Yeah, happy Friday, y'all, you guys. "
"4218200","4220200"," And mid-harris been happy Friday to you."
"4222980","4223960"," It's looking great, Wink."
"4233720","4237640"," Well, it's cooler too, Winky, on what you're showing me in the background here, Winky. "
"4238880","4240240"," What's really cool, it's so Winky."
"4242020","4244980"," So there's like, so this is a five minute chart, right?"
"4247440","4249080"," So this is a five minute chart, Winky."
"4249680","4254180"," Like, you can't even get, so even if we bounce here, like trying to time a bottom or something,"
"4255300","4257900"," even if we, let's say we get a big bounce right here, Winky. "
"4261520","4263300"," Let's make scream down here, right?"
"4263560","4265360"," Dipper head through the daily trigger."
"4265940","4273140"," On the white paper, there's a bunch of rules, like the time of day, what matters, like what hour is"
"4273140","4275580"," it, what part of the day?"
"4275740","4276760"," Is it the first thing in the morning?"
"4276760","4277520"," Is it end of the day?"
"4278840","4280560"," Explains what will happen here?"
"4282800","4291460"," But even so, if we blast through this, like we have to write another rule for if we stay under"
"4291460","4292180"," the daily trigger."
"4293080","4295440"," And then once the one in five cross it. "
"4296160","4299240"," And if the hour crosses it as well, what that means."
"4299240","4304920"," And then we also want to be tracking once price does."
"4305780","4309800"," So if we tag the daily trigger here, we even go through it for a minute. "
"4310990","4314920"," Like so you'd write the rule like a price fault, like price breaks daily trigger."
"4315380","4322860"," If price goes above daily trigger one in five minute, it's bullish to the hourly."
"4324500","4331020"," And then if price were to cross back below the one in five, it would become bearish again. "
"4331240","4332200"," But that trade would be good."
"4332640","4336580"," And there's like another rule in there about the kiss side of it."
"4336820","4341620"," If it comes even more bullish, if price goes above, retest it and goes higher. "
"4342000","4344300"," It's like a 90% probability it's going up."
"4345420","4346720"," So it looks something like this."
"4352100","4359010"," This is a five minute chart, right?"
"4359190","4360770"," So we made the alert in a five minute chart. "
"4367730","4370150"," This would begin, this would begin to flatten out."
"4377210","4380910"," It's like the rule would be price crosses, crosses daily trigger."
"4383670","4384250"," Boom, right?"
"4384530","4385510"," Like extreme bearishness. "
"4387270","4395510"," And then if price gets above, and then is able to cross and hold, like checks this one minute."
"4395990","4397330"," That makes it bullish to the upside."
"4399150","4403090"," And then of course you take the one on alert for the oil. "
"4403290","4405890"," If you need the alert for the five, you already know to take the money."
"4407090","4410750"," But this is actually where it becomes most really bullish right here."
"4412490","4422010"," This is actually where you put a trade on with high conviction. "
"4423730","4424970"," And this works on both sides."
"4425190","4427670"," If you flip this up for bearishness, same thing."
"4429470","4431910"," This works on the downside as well. "
"4432150","4433290"," When bearish bullish doesn't matter."
"4434930","4438990"," So like this part of the trade right here, you don't take these trades."
"4439150","4443450"," Well, you can take them for like five minutes, but you don't take them for like five minutes max. "
"4443450","4449270"," But if you're looking for like a reversal in price, this is where it's at right here."
"4449550","4450510"," Like that's where it's at."
"4451630","4455190"," So you need all these, all these math problems to say boom alert. "
"4455810","4457250"," We're bullish or boom alert."
"4457490","4457990"," We're bearish."
"4459670","4462730"," And the example of it here is right here. "
"4468340","4474080"," Price broke below, actually price broke below the five minute at what time?"
"4474080","4475800"," It's 7.15 am."
"4478260","4480380"," That's your first like we're getting bearish."
"4481900","4484600"," And then price confirmed underneath. "
"4487540","4491140"," And then at the moment you get this cross here as your last, we're going to start selling."
"4493420","4495060"," And there you go all the way down."
"4495980","4498440"," So this is, so this is like the 98%. "
"4499560","4502340"," This is where you make your money like 90% of the time is right here."
"4506860","4507760"," Like none of this."
"4507920","4508700"," You don't make your money here. "
"4508880","4512020"," Like this is high risk here for a bear or bull."
"4512240","4514840"," If this was flipped over, this is all actually high risk."
"4515260","4516060"," But it's not high risk. "
"4516460","4518760"," When price once price gets underneath becomes bearish."
"4519800","4525600"," But this is like the, this is when these, when this proves itself, this is, yeah, we're going down"
"4525600","4526320"," hard and heavy."
"4527120","4528940"," And you can actually see the retest here. "
"4531940","4534440"," And this confirms the leg even lower."
"4535880","4540120"," That's the retest on the, on the five minute 20, 70 am."
"4559060","4562380"," One other fascinating thing about this winky just so you can see something else. "
"4563940","4565780"," Is there are other rules."
"4566120","4569220"," We'll talk about these privately, but this first one right here."
"4571320","4573680"," That's the highest probability trade. "
"4574480","4576280"," This leg of the trade winky."
"4577760","4585440"," You should have cut 75% of your position and only left 25% on for this leg down."
"4587280","4592960"," And this part of the leg right here is like an extension of the trade. "
"4593260","4596080"," It's not a guaranteed thing and you can get blown out here."
"4596660","4598380"," This can reverse believe it or not."
"4598560","4600740"," Like we're getting into reversal territory down here. "
"4604250","4607470"," This is one of the key drivers of it is that retest of the five."
"4608250","4612370"," So when we're going up, you guys hear me like, Oh, if we go back and test that five minute."
"4613350","4615030"," And we're good to go higher. "
"4616170","4621790"," No, but it's, but it doesn't continue on usually for like another six hours."
"4623870","4626110"," It'll come back up and test that again."
"4629610","4631210"," What you'll see is another squeeze. "
"4633530","4638170"," And it'll come up and test it one more time and then confirm if we are going to go lower."
"4638910","4641250"," For prices, if not, it'll break over."
"4641790","4646330"," And once price confirms on that five, the trade is done. "
"4646730","4647830"," The down trade is done."
"4651410","4654030"," So right now we have confirmation on the five, right?"
"4654230","4656130"," On the five, twenty, seventy, a man, a five minute chart."
"4656950","4658430"," So the trade is down currently. "
"4661090","4664250"," And then we're looking for, we're looking for two things."
"4664390","4669110"," We're looking for velocity max bearish as a minus twenty five or minus fifty on the hourly."
"4669830","4673910"," And then we're looking for like minus twenty five or somewhere in there. "
"4674370","4680790"," And then we're looking for previous lows and pivots and some resistance on VIX, that kind of stuff."
"4682690","4683990"," Talking about this in the stream."
"4687290","4688410"," So we can write code. "
"4691150","4700800"," So we can, we can put what captain"
"4700800","4705200"," sees into a code so you guys will just have captain yelling at you."
"4707580","4708820"," With a robot voice."
"4714640","4715580"," Yeah, I love a winky. "
"4715720","4716480"," It looks awesome, man."
"4718180","4719500"," I'm looking at it right now still."
"4719800","4720920"," I got up on a screen in the background. "
"4733240","4737260"," Yeah, we said it didn't trade that like because only one third of the wind conditions were green."
"4737720","4738640"," 100% brother."
"4739700","4744180"," The other condition you want winky is you want to see if you can get a retest. "
"4745540","4753100"," So if like if price goes above the one and then the five, your next two conditions would be the"
"4753100","4756680"," crossover of the one or excuse me, the crossover."
"4757200","4759380"," So price crosses the white line and the red line."
"4759380","4762740"," And then you'd want for that to progress. "
"4763000","4767540"," You'd want to see the white line cross the red line and you'd want to see a check of that"
"4767540","4768200"," white line."
"4769220","4775120"," And that would be like the most bullish trend reversal, like that would be like the fucking bull"
"4775120","4775560"," boar."
"4777620","4778920"," And you'd have to add one more alert. "
"4779160","4784440"," You'd have to have like the price check on the white line and then it stays above as well."
"4784860","4786180"," That'd be your last alert."
"4791680","4792240"," Ooh. "
"4793860","4794780"," Is that bottom?"
"4801930","4804390"," Four tens are at 98 cents."
"4814410","4815790"," You move these down now."
"4817490","4841840"," You should"
"4841840","4843340"," get a nice snapback trade here. "
"4843760","4844100"," You should."
"4845180","4845940"," Watch out."
"4846040","4847420"," If you're a long put to be careful here. "
"4857310","4858810"," Be careful if you're long puts."
"4866950","4868290"," You could leave some on."
"4868550","4870930"," You could leave some on, but I wouldn't leave them all on here. "
"4871090","4872730"," We could get a snapback rally here."
"4875670","4878330"," Not guaranteed, but just be careful here."
"4897560","4900180"," Price trading below VIX one minute. "
"4901700","4905640"," Looking for a low on VIX of 17.01. It's right now."
"4905720","4939160"," It's at 17.19. 12 "
"4939160","4940160",".35 in the afternoon."
"4947700","4948240"," That's weird. "
"4948400","4949560"," I'm not a sign up."
"4949560","4950940"," I'm signed out of financial juice."
"4955760","4957120"," Now I'm not logged in. "
"4959600","4960740"," Let's see if I can."
"4969780","4974810"," I don't know why I'm not able to sign in here."
"4981120","4984820"," I'm not getting any voice here. "
"4998240","4999740"," Oh, so voice service is down."
"5000020","5000060"," Okay."
"5000060","5000140"," Yeah. "
"5007160","5011240"," I notice I'm like I'm logging in and I'm not able to log in here."
"5014080","5015600"," Add to a position down here."
"5015740","5016340"," Hold on. "
"5022120","5022840"," Some of that."
"5028910","5036930"," How do you VIX is going back for more, dude?"
"5037310","5039270"," See that winky VIX is going back up again."
"5039430","5041010"," I'm going to get knocked out of the straight. "
"5042590","5043630"," You can already tell."
"5047250","5048390"," I'm going to get kicked out here."
"5048470","5050330"," I'm going to get stopped out of this. "
"5053850","5055490"," Dude, VIX is blasting off."
"5055730","5065410"," Dude, VIX is trading 17.42. You guys watching VIX in the background?"
"5066210","5070070"," Reversed off the one minute, trading $17.44 right now."
"5073780","5076220"," I'm sitting on some 411 C's here. "
"5079860","5081800"," VIX is ripping face right now."
"5087250","5089510"," I'm in for like $0.40 or something like that."
"5090450","5091710"," $0.42 somewhere in there. "
"5096700","5097940"," Dude, look at that."
"5102520","5104700"," VIX is like facing it right now."
"5105680","5117190"," $4.10 or it's $0.75. I wanted those at $0.50. I'm going"
"5117190","5118050"," to buy one more here. "
"5118210","5118410"," Hold on."
"5120410","5121410"," No, no, no, no."
"5123790","5159280"," I want to buy those 4.10s. Dude,"
"5159400","5160160"," we're not even below that. "
"5160260","5162440"," We're just like just below S1 right now too."
"5163060","5163520"," It's kind of insane."
"5163880","5165340"," We're not even like, we're not even that deep. "
"5172160","5172800"," Oh, yeah."
"5173060","5174040"," Start making me some money, bro."
"5176820","5178300"," Start making me some money. "
"5180140","5181480"," There's my portfolio here."
"5190180","5191360"," Turn green, baby."
"5204140","5206340"," The calls are bouncing all over the place right now. "
"5222590","5224750"," They want to tag that last one down here."
"5224850","5225610"," See this one right here?"
"5226850","5228550"," They want to touch that so bad."
"5241950","5244210"," They're just like begging to touch this down here. "
"5245850","5253540"," The anal probing on the bulls right now."
"5256850","5258770"," And dude, VIX is like ready to explode."
"5259770","5260970"," I wonder if we have a bloodbath here. "
"5271780","5277260"," It looks like a bloodbath is setting up like a straight red bar, like a big ass red bar right"
"5277260","5277500"," here."
"5280540","5282280"," Like a big old red bar."
"5286260","5287120"," I'm scared. "
"5287580","5288760"," I hate buying dips like this."
"5297660","5300620"," This is yesterday's previous low."
"5301640","5302410"," Just a note. "
"5303780","5309380"," We are now lower than yesterday's low on Thursday low."
"5309380","5310760"," Let me see if I can show you guys this."
"5314000","5315660"," So here's yesterday's low. "
"5317440","5319700"," This is Wednesday's low right here."
"5323940","5328960"," 408.86. Daily trigger right here."
"5338700","5340240"," I'm getting probed right now. "
"5341000","5341960"," I'm getting the anal probe."
"5343680","5348420"," I'm like, man, I probably need to get out of these and probably buy this down here."
"5349300","5350760"," Yeah, they're going to anal probe me right now. "
"5352240","5354300"," Calls are 32 cents right now."
"5354360","5355920"," They were 36 just a moment ago."
"5356120","5357480"," I'm like, ah, do I just hold them?"
"5358080","5363300"," There are four leavens like that's a pretty big rip for me to get paid to get back up here. "
"5364100","5366020"," I don't know if I'm going to make that trade there."
"5366140","5369000"," Like here, it looks kind of like, yeah, we could get some of that."
"5370380","5373560"," So I'm probably going to get stopped out here in just a minute and have to take the trade down"
"5373560","5374040"," even lower. "
"5380290","5381270"," Or I'm going to add."
"5381370","5382710"," You know what I'm going to do is to add four tens."
"5390430","5392610"," So four tens now it's 69 cents. "
"5392830","5394970"," I'm going to keep the four leavens just in case."
"5397880","5400360"," I'm going to add another brick of four tenses."
"5407320","5408040"," Yeah, velocity. "
"5408820","5415240"," So like VIX right now is trading 17.48 and VIX should trade another 50 cents."
"5415920","5417860"," So we should get a bloodbath down here, Winky."
"5424900","5427620"," VIX is trading 17.49 right now. "
"5434830","5435950"," Four tens holding."
"5436130","5437930"," I don't own them right now, but they're 69 cents."
"5438170","5439490"," If I can get them at 50, I'll take them. "
"5445570","5449150"," Previous low at 408.86 down here."
"5462340","5463180"," Bag holding."
"5463640","5464960"," 411 C's. "
"5465360","5469140"," I'm down 25% on 411 C's right now."
"5479410","5482130"," 26%, maybe 27% somewhere in there."
"5490860","5498400"," And don't forget VIX is only trading right now, 17.54. So VIX trading 17.54, it'd be somewhere down"
"5498400","5498740"," in here. "
"5499380","5507450"," 408.86. So you'll see a blast through of this daily trigger."
"5513410","5515390"," Four tens sees at 58 cents."
"5515390","5517830"," I said I wanted them between 35 and 50. "
"5555600","5558020"," I'm trying to buy this right now and I'm not getting a fill."
"5560400","5561620"," They're not filling me here."
"5570940","5571620"," Hold on here. "
"5571760","5573180"," I might have actually gotten a fill on that."
"5603370","5604730"," Yeah, I'm loading up down here."
"5605930","5617510"," I still"
"5617510","5619170"," have more down to go here, likely. "
"5619450","5620550"," We're not done going down."
"5621070","5622670"," So just so you can see it in the background here."
"5626110","5627410"," Here's VIX right now. "
"5629610","5631670"," VIX ripping higher right now."
"5633710","5648620"," hourly trigger on VIX is 17.96. I'm"
"5648620","5650640"," starting a stable of calls right now."
"5650780","5652640"," I'm trying to buy a bunch of shit down here. "
"5653460","5656020"," I'm trying to buy for this trade higher right now right there."
"5657940","5659600"," So I'm loading the boat right now."
"5684770","5687570"," I'm going to make this last purchase right down in here. "
"5687910","5689110"," Just down in there."
"5690550","5691870"," Somewhere right down there."
"5691990","5693170"," Get that new low down there. "
"5729760","5731860"," So I'm going to have a finger on the buy button here."
"5733220","5759540"," A little"
"5759540","5760260"," bit more down, baby."
"5760400","5760960"," Get down there. "
"5771920","5782880"," VIX trading 17.61. I want the VIX to go to 17.96. Yeah,"
"5782980","5784020"," maybe I'll buy a little bit more here."
"5785440","5820280"," I want"
"5820280","5824700"," to see the previous low of 408.86 get broken down here."
"5824800","5826060"," It's a whole nother dollar almost. "
"5826460","5827180"," 20 or what is that?"
"5827780","5831660"," 14 plus 50 cents, 67 cents left to go down here."
"5839180","5856620"," VIX now trading 17.66. Look at that"
"5856620","5857680"," big bar down there."
"5874420","5876520"," Spy touching its daily trigger. "
"5877780","5878840"," I'll show you the spot."
"5879020","5880040"," I'll show you a spy right here."
"5883840","5887920"," It's a spy sitting right on its daily trigger right here. "
"5901160","5908640"," Last time we tagged the daily trigger was May 10th at 130-37."
"5910980","5912900"," Now will this daily trigger hold?"
"5913160","5915880"," I don't know if it breaks below and trades underneath it."
"5916630","5919080"," This could signal a big move lower. "
"5919940","5922200"," Just looking at a one minute chart here."
"5923500","5925880"," Going back to May 5th."
"5927120","5928460"," Then we crossed above it. "
"5928680","5934160"," We tested it here on May 10th at 130 in the afternoon."
"5935800","5940760"," We're going to see if this creates a bounce right here or if we break below it."
"5940920","5942360"," This is where I'm buying down here. "
"5945160","5946620"," Just so you can see it."
"5946740","5948460"," I don't think it holds."
"5949320","5951200"," I think we roll it and go lower. "
"5952100","5956580"," The reason I think that is because of the VIX."
"5957260","5958860"," The VIX down here."
"5962200","5963680"," It's getting up there, man. "
"5963980","5968440"," When you're getting this VIX right here, you can see price can continue higher."
"5969360","5971360"," You can get a bounce here and then roll it over."
"5973860","5975620"," We'll keep an eye on the VIX here. "
"5975820","5981200"," If we do get the bounce here, if we don't, if we finally break the daily trigger or not, it's"
"5981200","5981700"," to be known."
"5982340","5984000"," I'm going to look back real quick on."
"5985680","5988900"," Let's look and see what took place on the last time we were down here. "
"5989040","5992360"," Last time we were down here, we tagged this daily trigger."
"5992560","5994580"," I'm going to go over to that chart and we'll look at it."
"6004180","6005860"," I'm long a bunch of shit right now. "
"6023810","6024770"," May 10th."
"6028530","6035510"," I still think we're going down here, but so right down here."
"6042020","6045220"," That's what I'm hoping for is that face ripper into the bell. "
"6045720","6047640"," I don't think we get the face ripper into the bell."
"6048560","6050400"," That's the dip that I'm buying right now."
"6057170","6060610"," The fly in the ointment on buying this dip right here. "
"6060950","6065390"," The big fly in the ointment is normally we're going pivot to pivot."
"6065730","6067150"," This pivot hasn't been hit yet."
"6068210","6070810"," This pivot has not been hit. "
"6072150","6074290"," I'd like to see that pivot get tagged."
"6077370","6083130"," The VIX could still trade easily to that $18 mark."
"6089130","6091610"," I'll leave this price here. "
"6091870","6094450"," 408.86 I think we're going to go down there and tag it."
"6094790","6095950"," You might even break through it."
"6096170","6101010"," I'm doing this stuff here, but in reality it's probably like a dip through and then we come up"
"6101010","6101230"," higher. "
"6101910","6105330"," Well, not risky."
"6106250","6108690"," I'd rather be buying calls here than anywhere up here."
"6110070","6112270"," I'm more confident to where we are right now. "
"6121090","6123830"," I got a little more ammo for down here."
"6124070","6128470"," If we get down into here, I'll DC this stuff down here and try to get us back up here."
"6129530","6131350"," My foot's asleep. "
"6134550","6142990"," The one good thing for bears is if we were to close under this daily trigger, bears can get a"
"6142990","6144890"," close in here at the end of the day."
"6144890","6146990"," This is bearish into Monday open."
"6149790","6155170"," Breaking through it's no big deal and then bouncing back up, no big deal, but a close underneath. "
"6157010","6159010"," This one specifically right here."
"6159930","6160450"," No bueno."
"6161850","6163150"," No bueno for a bull. "
"6164270","6165610"," This is trend right here."
"6165930","6166650"," Daily trend is important."
"6167530","6171930"," We also know that daily trend is very bearish on spy right now. "
"6172870","6174430"," It's like long in the tooth."
"6185580","6186720"," And a bunch of shit."
"6186840","6190300"," I own four eleven C's, I own four ten C's. "
"6211290","6213210"," There's not a lot of juice left to the downside."
"6242040","6247120"," I'm taking an exact number, 409.55 daily trigger right now."
"6260380","6262160"," Don't like seeing price under that. "
"6264280","6267160"," Sellers coming in right on that daily trigger trying to push it down."
"6283580","6286080"," I think part of this show is me buying the dip, isn't it?"
"6288280","6290300"," Like we get down here into like the dirty dogs."
"6295340","6296820"," Everyone's like market crash. "
"6300700","6303060"," And I'm like, yeah, I'm buying the dip down here."
"6306880","6309160"," Get loud with market crash so I can buy a dip."
"6312460","6314320"," Winky and I this morning we're talking about. "
"6316940","6317800"," Winky was like."
"6320180","6324320"," He's like, I just, he's like, just this morning I started seeing a bunch of old guys."
"6327820","6329480"," Talking about how we're going to 430. "
"6333540","6335120"," He's like, what do you think of that?"
"6337720","6339560"," And I'm like, yeah, you know what I think."
"6339740","6344720"," And he's like, yeah, he's like, he's like, he's like when the old guys start saying it, you know"
"6344720","6345680"," that we're not going there."
"6346500","6348720"," Like you want everybody saying we're going to the depths of hell. "
"6351100","6353780"," It's like the more people that scream that we're going to the depths of hell."
"6354980","6357080"," The more I'm like these, we're not going fucking anywhere."
"6362310","6365050"," But then like when the old guys are out there going, we're going to 480. "
"6365050","6366970"," I'm like shit, time to sell."
"6382750","6384930"," Now he's got these fucking algorithms."
"6385610","6394190"," It's like an algorithm somewhere and it's like Must tag previous low. "
"6398420","6399420"," Can't go back up."
"6399700","6401080"," Must tag previous low."
"6409280","6410000"," Compelled. "
"6411440","6411980"," Mathematical."
"6412820","6413420"," Must do it."
"6427770","6428930"," Yeah, I agree, man. "
"6429150","6429790"," We're right there, man."
"6429990","6431270"," We're about to turn around, brother."
"6433430","6436090"," Next 80 cents dollar somewhere in there. "
"6438430","6440090"," We're getting long in the tooth, baby."
"6442030","6443510"," Need that VIX to get up there."
"6445530","6447970"," It's at 1773 right now, bro. "
"6450070","6452210"," I just needed to go another 20 cents or so."
"6454050","6457810"," Need VIX to max out of like, it's at 1775 right now."
"6495220","6499020"," If we can get this tag right here, I'm going to do one last buy right here. "
"6508080","6508800"," Right there."
"6513940","6514840"," If it turns, it turns."
"6517220","6520160"," If it blasts down and hits it, we'll add. "
"6531470","6533930"," VIX trading 1778 right now."
"6540130","6543190"," Needs another 20 cents on it."
"6556890","6566810"," Oh, more than that, $17.99. It's trading 1779 right now, so another 20 cents. "
"6658320","6661280"," We got a question via text that said we're going to crash."
"6662480","6663640"," I said, fuck no."
"6664100","6665180"," We're going to rip faces off. "
"6693010","6695730"," Price above the daily trigger right now."
"6701020","6709800"," Algorithms not able to get the previous low at 408.86. Can they come back for it?"
"6724800","6725860"," Making money, dude."
"6730000","6732400"," We got a bunch of 4.10s at like 50 cents. "
"6734880","6737220"," 4.11s coming back with some life in them again."
"6738000","6743820"," Those are now only down 20% or so, but the 4.10s are making me money."
"6759780","6769620"," Need to get above 409.73. So, Winky, if you're watching"
"6769620","6772520"," in the background, what you want to do right here is..."
"6782460","6783280"," I'll show you this. "
"6791820","6793940"," Winky, go back and look at the..."
"6795900","6804340"," Go back and look on the VIX on May 3rd at 240 in the afternoon."
"6809060","6812500"," You can kind of see how VIX breaks into the daily."
"6812760","6815740"," Comes back down and then the hourly continues higher. "
"6817000","6819840"," And that's where you see the break in the..."
"6819840","6820960"," In Spy."
"6830950","6835110"," May 3rd at 250 in the afternoon on VIX."
"6836070","6838330"," You can actually look back too on..."
"6846400","6847020"," That's right. "
"6847220","6849220"," Make me some fucking money right now."
"6849480","6850220"," I'm green, baby."
"6852260","6853940"," I am green as fuck right now. "
"6859440","6860400"," Woo-hoo!"
"6866450","6867070"," Blue doggy!"
"6875230","6876270"," Get back up there."
"6876370","6876970"," Keep on pumping."
"6878350","6879710"," You're not done pumping. "
"6891500","6892080"," Always..."
"6893740","6895580"," Always stressful doing that shit."
"6903870","6905690"," Now this shit better not stop."
"6908190","6910830"," Because I'll get stopped out if it doesn't stop. "
"6912770","6914830"," Roll that shit over on the VIX."
"6915250","6917290"," Give me $17 on the VIX, please."
"6919650","6921990"," I'll take $17, $28, $2. "
"6925810","6927530"," Get your ass down there, VIX."
"6936020","6940540"," So, Winky, like right where we are right now, like keep your eye on..."
"6941300","6943820"," So, Winky, keep your eye on the hourly trigger."
"6948260","6952420"," So, Winky, if VIX comes back down and..."
"6952420","6955440"," So, see how the hourly is going down right now. "
"6957500","6959160"," It's like VIX right now, currently."
"6959480","6960880"," See how the hourly is going down."
"6961940","6967800"," If the hourly was screaming higher right now, it would be like, start not crashing, but, you know,"
"6967880","6972440"," like we'd get the major, like, we're down 200 points on spy today. "
"6973980","6978680"," Do you see how the behavior of the hourly is trending down and not up?"
"6982780","6987180"," If it begins to start moving higher right now, I'm going to be scared shitless in this trade."
"6992490","6995810"," So, keep your eyes Winky on that green line on VIX."
"6997390","7000690"," Like, I want that green line to go away. "
"7000830","7003410"," I don't want it to chase up."
"7004690","7007970"," If it chases up, then I'm scared that we're going to have a bloodbath."
"7031820","7033100"," Still long calls here. "
"7036470","7038470"," I'm looking to see what happens with the VIX."
"7039030","7043410"," Does the VIX retest $17, $28?"
"7045710","7062740"," Does it retest, like, now it's $17.10. And"
"7062740","7064540"," I'm, like, greenish and flat."
"7065060","7065800"," Like, I'm, like, up. "
"7066240","7067740"," I'm, like, up, like, 100 bucks."
"7069060","7070340"," Up 50 bucks."
"7071560","7071880"," Then flat. "
"7072400","7073200"," Then up 100 bucks."
"7076560","7077320"," It's getting salty."
"7077800","7079780"," Or at least for, at least for, like, the middle of the day. "
"7079880","7081480"," It's 1.11 in the afternoon."
"7083120","7085320"," That's been a nice, gorgeous cell day."
"7085660","7087860"," Nice, gorgeous, uh, cell all day long. "
"7088240","7088800"," Open the day."
"7089120","7090260"," Green dude is a great day, dude."
"7090940","7092920"," And, uh, nice cell today. "
"7094180","7099600"," Even if we get down here later in the day, I'm not anti-going back down here and just tagging"
"7099600","7100860"," this shit at some point today."
"7102260","7103560"," Yeah, I'm green right now, man."
"7103680","7104080"," I'm cranking. "
"7105900","7154730"," Fucking 4 "
"7154730","7157150",".10s were, like, 50 cents just a little while ago."
"7158970","7160690"," 4.10s saving my ass right now."
"7174560","7175400"," There we go. "
"7175560","7176040"," There we go."
"7201360","7202420"," Making money, baby."
"7225180","7238210"," Now, VIX trading $17.46. I'm"
"7238210","7240090"," going to bring up the VIX really quick for you here. "
"7247320","7249020"," I'm going to talk about the VIX real quick here."
"7250260","7259480"," I was trying to talk to Winky about this earlier."
"7260380","7261460"," I'll show you guys something here. "
"7265020","7267360"," So, it's kind of a crucial point rate."
"7267480","7270500"," If you're a bear, you want to pay attention to this."
"7277710","7280790"," Like, see how the hourly velocity is aggressively. "
"7283310","7286430"," The green is aggressively going north, right?"
"7287430","7288530"," It's not sideways."
"7289770","7291750"," The green changes."
"7295350","7297690"," The green is like that, right?"
"7297990","7298350"," You see it?"
"7298930","7300430"," The green is like that, right?"
"7300670","7302330"," The green's not going this way, right?"
"7303850","7306450"," And the green is not going like this, right?"
"7307410","7307950"," It's in the VIX. "
"7309750","7312110"," This is hourly velocity, right?"
"7312450","7314530"," Velocity is telling you the direction that we're going."
"7318920","7319760"," Sideways, right?"
"7321740","7323620"," It's going down a little bit, but it's sideways."
"7324100","7325020"," You get the gist, right?"
"7325200","7326240"," It's going down at sideways. "
"7326620","7327760"," We know we're long in the..."
"7327760","7330320"," We know that we're long right now in the tooth on day."
"7331100","7334160"," On deli velocity, we know that, like, we're at the top of deli velocity, right?"
"7336700","7338400"," I should show this to you in a 30-minute chart."
"7338620","7340460"," Maybe you guys are..."
"7340460","7342900"," It's better to show it on deli velocity. "
"7346000","7347960"," Actually, we're ready to rip some faces off."
"7349220","7350260"," On VIX, excuse me."
"7352400","7355680"," So, this is what I'm showing on daily velocity, right?"
"7355820","7361000"," Specifically, I always like using the 30-minute chart, swing-trader chart. "
"7362600","7364460"," And I'm going to explain it real simple for you."
"7364800","7365820"," Make it really simple here."
"7369740","7372240"," So, in VIX, right, I want to buy VIX down here, right?"
"7373940","7375420"," I want to buy VIX right here, right?"
"7376000","7376420"," Makes sense?"
"7378020","7379120"," So, should the market roll over?"
"7379340","7380380"," Yeah, I mean, like, it should. "
"7380380","7384300"," Like, when we're down there, when VIX is this low, it's telling you buy VIX."
"7385640","7390520"," You can see this instance down here where you buy the VIX, and it printed, right?"
"7391500","7393760"," Now, this VIX did not print, did it?"
"7394120","7395660"," I didn't get a print on this one."
"7396360","7400240"," But this one's saying to get to buy the VIX, and if you do, right?"
"7401560","7403620"," And the big VIX print is on the upside. "
"7404180","7409180"," So, if you bought the VIX down here, bought the VIX down here, whatever VIX is negative, you buy"
"7409180","7409400"," it."
"7411060","7412900"," You actually did get the print on that one."
"7415260","7419360"," So, and VIX eventually will turn green, right?"
"7419540","7420660"," You can see it right here in prints. "
"7421540","7423760"," And you can see the VIX start on a daily at least."
"7424260","7430480"," You're going to expect the VIX to begin to go higher, and we'll get new lows on spy, SPX or"
"7430480","7430680"," whatever."
"7432680","7435860"," And you want to be buying the VIX on the hourly when it's down here, right?"
"7436580","7440760"," And you hope that the VIX will go up and get your nice fat print. "
"7444200","7447780"," And I showed you velocity, not velocity, but the triggers, right?"
"7448740","7451500"," The screen line is the triggers, sideways, right?"
"7452660","7456860"," So, on a one-minute chart, what I'm looking for here in a one-minute chart is..."
"7460300","7461660"," This shit right here."
"7465490","7468970"," Like, see how velocity on VIX is to the downside?"
"7470790","7475810"," And then see how it's flattening, and now starting to come up, I'm like, ooh, I don't know."
"7477450","7487890"," And like, if hourly sugar comes up here, and the five-minute sugar comes up like this, then"
"7487890","7491470"," VIX has a better chance of breaking through the hour. "
"7496830","7501830"," So, if the price of VIX is like, yeah, we're going to go back here and check this shit."
"7502850","7509270"," And if VIX is not falling off, this velocity can rip VIX right through the daily."
"7515840","7524180"," And the next target for VIX is $20.31. And how that would play out, if it did play out,"
"7524220","7525720"," how it would play out would be something like this. "
"7525920","7528360"," I'll show you what the expectation would be."
"7534150","7536490"," Like, I want to be watching velocity while this is happening."
"7545620","7546580"," Something like that. "
"7547500","7548040"," Goddamn it."
"7548700","7550040"," So, sorry, stripes weren't."
"7553600","7557920"," And if I'm like, yeah, were you going up there, like questioning myself, are we going up there?"
"7560620","7567040"," If daily velocity was on the upside, like plus 50 or plus 25, I would give it less of a"
"7567040","7567280"," chance. "
"7569200","7571600"," But VIX is coming up from the bottom right now."
"7572620","7576720"," So, there's a better chance of VIX getting up there, right?"
"7577620","7578480"," Over time."
"7583470","7584370"," Does that make sense?"
"7584970","7591590"," So, like, over time, once velocity can pick up to the upside for VIX, at some point we're going to"
"7591590","7592390"," go up there. "
"7593970","7598750"," And at some point, Spy is going to break the daily trigger."
"7598750","7601410"," And start to go down."
"7601770","7602370"," Makes sense. "
"7602870","7605070"," At some point, we don't just break and touch this."
"7606090","7610330"," At some point, we actually break this and start making a leg lower."
"7612530","7614930"," So, how do you break this down here?"
"7616050","7618630"," So, let's say we do roll right here. "
"7622560","7623120"," Right?"
"7623380","7625620"," And we get down to this one last buy down here."
"7627720","7629540"," Let's say price went down there."
"7631600","7634900"," And you're like, we buy in the dip cap or not. "
"7636540","7644560"," I would be looking on the VIX for price to be above the daily trigger and the hourly supporting it."
"7644780","7650320"," Like the hourly breaking through the daily trigger, breaking through the daily trigger and velocity"
"7650320","7651720"," ramping, right?"
"7652480","7654780"," For that max bearishness to break through down below."
"7663390","7665650"," Otherwise, you buy the fucking dip. "
"7681430","7682550"," Oh, shit."
"7691680","7696730"," I don't know if you guys all get that or not."
"7696990","7699230"," We're actually writing the math for it right now. "
"7700790","7702610"," It's like, Winky is in the background, dude."
"7702870","7706410"," Like, writing all this math out like, okay, if this happens, then that happens, if this happens,"
"7706430","7707170"," then this happens."
"7708330","7709390"," Don't buy this dip. "
"7711310","7714830"," Or you have a high failure rate of, like, can you buy that dip or not?"
"7716890","7718410"," Will that dip buy and break?"
"7721330","7724630"," Will that dip buy and rip some faces off to the upside?"
"7748160","7749720"," Now even saying this, right?"
"7751060","7751900"," We already know."
"7751980","7756280"," I just showed you guys, like, I want to know what the price interaction is on the hourly trigger"
"7756280","7756800"," and VIX."
"7756900","7757760"," Like, I want to know that, right?"
"7758640","7759780"," Does it break the VIX or not?"
"7760920","7762740"," So this trade's only good for what?"
"7762980","7763300"," Let me know. "
"7763400","7763980"," You guys in the chat."
"7763980","7766660"," The trade is good to here, right?"
"7768860","7771000"," So you exit calls right here."
"7774300","7776960"," 410 C's trade, 81 cents. "
"7784980","7791000"," And if you're like a bull and you're like, okay, now I'm watching the VIX, how it interacts with"
"7791000","7791820"," the hourly trigger."
"7792820","7797420"," If the VIX breaks through the hourly trigger, there's your second trade right there."
"7801060","7802260"," Now these are all risky. "
"7802540","7804300"," You're like, well, I'm doing risky shit right here."
"7805060","7806480"," Well, it's not really risky."
"7806720","7809360"," It looks risky on paper, but it's not. "
"7809540","7810760"," If you know the math, it's not risky."
"7818120","7818520"," Whoo!"
"7821120","7823200"," This thing should be following this right here."
"7825720","7826520"," Whoo-hoo!"
"7826520","7833530"," So you take profit here and then you have a second trade right here. "
"7837560","7838740"," Big old green bars."
"7839620","7848720"," Now this second trade, you need to first C price get above and recheck the second"
"7848720","7849640"," trade."
"7851460","7859080"," If you get the recheck, that would be the hourly velocity failing. "
"7863630","7866150"," Then your next trade is to the upside."
"7867610","7868710"," Right there."
"7871600","7873880"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"7875500","7876640"," Oh, yeah."
"7878480","7885700"," Dollar three on 410 C's, 411 C's, trading 53 cents right now."
"7886540","7887720"," This is your captain speaking. "
"7903200","7906080"," Trade is dead, believe it or not."
"7908400","7911880"," Next trade from here to here is not alive yet."
"7913160","7915020"," You need to see consolidation. "
"7918480","7921760"," Hire, tag it, and then go higher to the next one up here."
"7922460","7923460"," Trade is now dead."
"7936180","7939140"," That's two dip trades for the bulls. "
"7939140","7940520"," One right there."
"7941880","7944920"," And a big one right, it actually started over here."
"7945700","7947220"," And just keep buying the dips relentlessly. "
"7960000","7962380"," I am very green on the day, I'm very happy here."
"7963240","7965480"," Close some calls on the bell, made some money."
"7966500","7967840"," Bought a dip, made some money. "
"7970940","7973280"," Pretty happy here, I'll be honest with you."
"7978920","7980460"," Yeah, you should have a bear."
"7981940","7984020"," Should I break a bear out or no?"
"7984460","7985800"," I've been a long ass week, dude. "
"7986040","7987280"," Dude, I've had a winning day every day this week."
"7987620","7988680"," This was like win, win, win."
"7988920","7991620"," I've been upside down, but this whole week's been good. "
"7993960","7996440"," Dude, that tool is so fucking awesome, Winky."
"8000950","8002550"," It's like the money printer, man."
"8003790","8005210"," It's like a money printer, dude. "
"8006350","8007730"," It's like a straight money printer."
"8019300","8021180"," It's a straight fucking money printer, dude."
"8052910","8054530"," It's like a gangster trait, dude. "
"8054710","8057550"," Dude, this shit winky, this shit is so badass."
"8066250","8067050"," Bears, baby."
"8067590","8068530"," Yeah, I'll get a bear. "
"8068690","8069830"," It's been a long ass week, man."
"8070030","8070290"," It's been a long ass week, man."
"8070290","8070570"," It's been a long ass week, man. "
"8070770","8071370"," Let's have a bear together."
"8071650","8074790"," I'm gonna go take a break and..."
"8075850","8077910"," I'm gonna break, I'll leave the stream on and shit."
"8078010","8078530"," I'm gonna go have a bear. "
"8078810","8079370"," Let's have a bear together."
"8079910","8081350"," It's one 28 in the afternoon, man."
"8081450","8082130"," It's been a long ass week. "
"8087340","8088740"," Fucking love this tool, Winky."
"8089960","8091940"," I'm so fucking free money maker, man."
"8102220","8106240"," You know what's funny too about this tool is, you know what's insane about this tool?"
"8108140","8115220"," It's like sometimes you get a tool and it's like built by like Furus or like stock bros or like"
"8115220","8121740"," someone like me is doing it or just like a coder is doing it, like the guys that are working"
"8121740","8126480"," on this shit, they're like the smartest fucking people out in the country. "
"8127240","8135800"," But you can't hire these people, you just can't, you can't hire these, you can, but"
"8135800","8142060"," it would be hard like you'd have like you'd have like like beg plea, like not beg plea, but you"
"8142060","8144920"," wouldn't even know like some random calls calls you up you're working at."
"8146240","8151660"," One of these big tech firms, you're like I need to make some money in the stock market and you"
"8151660","8159200"," guys have out there, you guys have two of these two badasses just working on the stuff, like"
"8159200","8165320"," straight gangsters, like no, not even like a fake, like not a fake resume to like, like, yeah, I"
"8165320","8174240"," work for this company, like these guys are like the guys at these companies, gangsters, we're"
"8179200","8184760"," probably going to get shut down by the hedge funds or some as you see in FINRA is coming for"
"8184760","8184980"," us."
"8186940","8190960"," You know, Winky, I'm going to give that like a 15% chance of happening. "
"8195520","8198879"," There's probably real risk they're going to come shut us down at some point when that shit goes"
"8198879","8199200"," live."
"8207360","8211299"," Maybe we just shut the whole thing down, Winky, we just go sailing and make some money together."
"8216040","8225040"," We'll get like, we'll get like UI and Mr. P and Mr. D with us, grab all the boys from"
"8225040","8225400"," the discord. "
"8225700","8230240"," We'll grab everybody from the chat sessions and YouTube and Twitch, we'll bring them along."
"8231360","8234059"," We'll have like a cruise ship or something with all of us in it."
"8236780","8241180"," We'll be like a couple thousand of us just hanging out. "
"8251270","8254709"," Yeah, don't exactly, don't talk about the tool to anybody, don't tell anybody."
"8256309","8257610"," Don't tell your friends, dude."
"8257790","8260309"," If you're in the stream right now, like just don't tell your fucking friends. "
"8261150","8266330"," You don't want everybody knowing about it or that it's not just the tool, we have a bunch of tools."
"8266330","8270510"," Like Mr. P is working on some insane tools."
"8273570","8275410"," It's going to like piss off the internet. "
"8282870","8287690"," It's going to piss off a lot of the narrative you guys are sold out there because we have the"
"8287690","8292790"," actual data and the data is a lot different than what you're fed."
"8294450","8304370"," I mean like people trying to take your money, the data disagrees, and I can't tell you guys"
"8304370","8305049"," about this stuff."
"8305190","8311370"," Yeah, when it comes out like you'll be able to see it for yourself and be like shit. "
"8315110","8321370"," I'm not going to say hoo, but like there was, we were in a meeting this morning and we were"
"8321370","8330910"," talking about how like there's very, a lot of these services use very smooth emotional,"
"8334049","8339670"," it's very fascinating to you like why do they sell this, like why do they sell this like this?"
"8340770","8347629"," So the question becomes why are they selling this when the data disagrees with it?"
"8348990","8358990"," But what they're selling is your emotions, like an emotional response, it's"
"8358990","8359570"," kind of fucked up."
"8370940","8376559"," I was talking to, I was like, I bet some of these streamers what they do, like these YouTubers,"
"8376559","8384040"," they probably go out there and they're like, they're like what stock is everyone, what stock is"
"8384040","8384280"," everybody?"
"8386200","8391700"," I think you could probably make a whole entire career off of finding out what stock you're trapped"
"8391700","8392060"," in."
"8394020","8406240"," And then like just like pander to their emotions, just fucked up, so you"
"8406240","8408620"," like show up every morning and be like is it going to go up, is it going to go up,"
"8408620","8412180"," is it going to go up and I just tell you good stories like sweet talk to you to you,"
"8412340","8422150"," then they'd be like buy my training course or something, buy my"
"8422150","8433900"," real estate course, something insane, it's really"
"8433900","8434860"," it's it's disgusting. "
"8436460","8443160"," Okay, so someone asked in chat, how do you know if this trade becomes valid?"
"8447840","8449320"," It's quite simple."
"8451380","8458180"," You need to like a base case on spy, you need to see green bars."
"8459960","8462680"," So you I want you to know that there are sellers right here. "
"8464560","8472860"," The strong sellers are up here and the weak sellers are right here, but these weak sellers don't"
"8472860","8477560"," want to give up right, they want to hold this, they don't want to get they don't like they want"
"8477560","8478000"," more down."
"8479760","8485760"," And we already know that we haven't tagged this this this low down here, so you know algorithms"
"8486250","8488700"," like to trade pivots, right?"
"8488920","8497100"," Algorithms want to close gaps, algorithms want to trade levels, like calculated levels."
"8497680","8501360"," They also want to trade previous highs and lows. "
"8503600","8507500"," They love it like a like you can't have an algorithm buying and selling the market."
"8508540","8512420"," Like this isn't you and I like emotional trader traders and stuff like that."
"8513420","8517700"," These are computers that they will like, we're going to go all the way up and tag this pivot. "
"8518160","8519940"," It's a no number that I can calculate."
"8521000","8523240"," Then to the downside, same thing, right?"
"8525400","8532320"," And they're going to check and make sure that there are still buyers there or overwhelming sellers"
"8532320","8535860"," or underwhelming sellers, right, price discovery."
"8538260","8541420"," So these computers, they do all this shit all day long in the background, right?"
"8541840","8549400"," And so it's like a bunch of stuff you're already thinking in your brain, you're like, like, all"
"8549400","8552520"," right, we're going to go up here and see if the sellers are still here. "
"8554060","8559160"," If there's still here, we'll go down and check again, right?"
"8559800","8560920"," That's how you get a double bottom."
"8563180","8565360"," And you find out there's more buyers, right?"
"8566200","8568300"," If not, we'll go down here."
"8568300","8570260"," We already know that this is a pivot. "
"8571160","8575400"," We've already broken through the previous pivot of the daily trigger right here."
"8576360","8579460"," So this is gone, more kind of gone."
"8580720","8587260"," If we know the next logical place is the S2, right, support. "
"8588380","8590860"," And we also have this little guy down here hanging out."
"8592060","8593500"," And they want this shit, man."
"8593640","8597660"," They want it really bad, like a computer does. "
"8597860","8600820"," And algorithms like, oh, I want that so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad, so bad."
"8600820","8610540"," And then I talked to you about velocity earlier on the"
"8610540","8611240"," VIX, right?"
"8612160","8617960"," Talked about velocity on the spy, daily velocity, hourly velocity, how strong it is that we're"
"8617960","8623240"," going up, how strong it is that we're going down, timeframe of going up and going down, all that"
"8623240","8623620"," kind of stuff."
"8627270","8628750"," We know about this one down here. "
"8629210","8630730"," I'm flat right now, by the way, if you're wondering."
"8634710","8642910"," So we know the VIX is trying to break above the hourly velocity or hourly trigger on the VIX is"
"8642910","8645910"," trying to get above the daily trigger on the VIX."
"8646390","8647870"," We know eventually it's going to happen. "
"8647990","8648490"," We don't know when."
"8648950","8650370"," We don't know if it's now or down the road."
"8651430","8656430"," But we can extrapolate velocity. "
"8659290","8662350"," And velocity will tell us, yeah, we can break through here or not."
"8667420","8670420"," On the hourly, it's not showing that we can."
"8671020","8674660"," So the hourly VIX right now is not saying that we can break through this. "
"8675160","8677600"," It's saying we can go down here, but not break through it."
"8679320","8681640"," Because hourly VIX is really high right now."
"8681860","8687980"," Hourly VIX is at plus 14. "
"8689380","8692680"," I'd like to see the hourly VIX at like minus 25."
"8693440","8699580"," If we were right here, VIX is at like minus 25 because minus 50 here and minus 25 right here,"
"8699640","8701180"," but we're going to break this thing."
"8701260","8702240"," We're going to go to the depth of hell. "
"8703240","8705500"," It's like right now, not seeing it."
"8711540","8715400"," I see this, but I don't see."
"8715740","8716200"," I see this. "
"8716680","8718080"," I see a double tap and then up."
"8720540","8722880"," I see trade sideways into the bell."
"8725860","8730840"," But I don't see is blast down here and then sell down there. "
"8731040","8732480"," I'm not seeing that right now."
"8735060","8736380"," That one I'm not seeing."
"8740380","8742200"," So look for dips to buy. "
"8745810","8747590"," Maybe hold some puts in here."
"8749870","8754250"," I don't like buying puts down here because I'm not inputs from the open."
"8754830","8764620"," So like up here, I can monetize all this shit down here and then leave"
"8764620","8765600"," some runners on. "
"8766660","8770940"," Like 25% of my trade, I can leave on for this nonsense down here."
"8771320","8776040"," If this burns, I don't care, right?"
"8776240","8785500"," If I monetize puts here, let's say I bought puts up here for 25 cents and I monetize them for"
"8785500","8787200"," $3 down here."
"8789920","8792080"," I wouldn't leave that trade on, right?"
"8792080","8799620"," I take the $3 that I made and then buy some 25 cents puts again for this move down below,"
"8799680","8800000"," right?"
"8800180","8800620"," Does that make sense?"
"8802240","8805140"," Oftentimes in stream, I think like two things happen. "
"8805600","8807460"," Not just stream, like I think traders in general."
"8809560","8810680"," Especially new traders."
"8811860","8813340"," Two things happen with new traders. "
"8814400","8816440"," You'd think this doesn't happen, but it happens all the time."
"8819040","8820580"," It doesn't matter if it's a call or put."
"8820680","8821700"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear. "
"8822320","8826280"," Like you'll buy like puts here for 25 cents, let's say, right?"
"8829100","8830760"," And they go to let's say $3."
"8832180","8833200"," $2 a dollar."
"8833360","8834120"," It doesn't fucking matter. "
"8834280","8837180"," If you go to $1, $2, $3, it doesn't fucking matter."
"8841070","8845530"," What they'll do, right, is they'll just leave this on and be like, it's never coming back on me."
"8845530","8847390"," I bought it at 25. "
"8847830","8848890"," It'll stay at three."
"8849850","8850390"," Does that make sense?"
"8851370","8854090"," If it goes to $2.75, what do I care?"
"8854350","8855770"," I got plenty of space there."
"8858570","8865670"," The reality is, like the open this morning, you realize profit. "
"8866390","8868710"," You take the money to Qing made three bucks."
"8869490","8871330"," And this has to do with Greeks too."
"8871650","8873610"," And option interest. "
"8874310","8881510"," If there's like a thousand people that want those options, the premium goes up on that put."
"8882730","8890730"," If now, even if we go down more, if only a hundred people want those puts, premium goes down on"
"8890730","8891530"," those puts, right?"
"8891730","8893870"," So you can still lose money on premium."
"8895950","8898430"," So you monetize the move. "
"8902250","8910440"," I made $2.75. And here's where the second problem people do."
"8910560","8911160"," This is bulls and bears."
"8911320","8912240"," It doesn't matter, especially new traders. "
"8913260","8918000"," So now we have less people interested in us going down, even if we do."
"8919640","8921700"," So you have a re-pricing of options."
"8925500","8926360"," They get cheaper. "
"8927620","8928640"," Because not as many people want them."
"8928940","8930360"," Even if we go there, not that many people."
"8930360","8931600"," People wanted this right here. "
"8935640","8939240"," Now you've taken your $2.75. Other people stay in it."
"8941440","8947800"," When this guy that took $2.75, he can just buy some more $0.25 calls down here."
"8948860","8958690"," Or puts, excuse me, keep $2.50. He knows that he's keeping $2.50. And his"
"8958690","8961430"," only risk is $0.25. They can go to zero. "
"8961750","8962470"," What the fuck does he care?"
"8963170","8969350"," So your first issue is, as a trader is monetizing, positioning."
"8971650","8977710"," Like the direction you're going in, renegotiating at the second or third trade."
"8978490","8979210"," I took the money and ran. "
"8979890","8982370"," I'll renegotiate the next leg down."
"8985550","8995470"," And then the second big issue that traders have is, hey, I made $2.75. I just"
"8995470","8996350"," made $10 grand."
"8999070","9002930"," I made a trade up here for $5K. "
"9006700","9007920"," And I'm out."
"9008800","9009860"," I made $10K."
"9012700","9016440"," So then you ask that trader, you go, okay, so what was your next trade?"
"9018000","9019640"," What about 10,000 calls?"
"9020880","9024960"," Like, what do you mean you bought 10,000 calls?"
"9028640","9030960"," Like, when did you buy 5,000 calls?"
"9031300","9035480"," Why did you buy a thousand in calls and build up to 5K?"
"9036560","9038020"," And they're like, no, no, no, no, man. "
"9038140","9039600"," I went $10,000 in calls."
"9039900","9044160"," Then we roll over and I've blown my account up."
"9044160","9046620"," So sizing up when you shouldn't. "
"9049080","9050040"," Not DCAing."
"9052240","9054540"," Thinking you're a baller trader."
"9057520","9061160"," And then not renegotiating is the big one, though. "
"9062740","9063580"," Realized profits."
"9064020","9066560"," And I know you guys will find people out there and vent to it."
"9066640","9072160"," They'll be like, if your conviction is that we're going down to 360, you go all in and you hold"
"9072160","9073080"," until it happens. "
"9075240","9076200"," That's bullshit."
"9078040","9080680"," If your trade goes against you, you get the fuck on out."
"9081520","9086320"," If your thesis isn't right when you make a trade, I don't care if it's one month, five days, one"
"9086320","9086640"," year. "
"9087480","9088780"," Get the fuck on out."
"9089160","9090500"," There's something wrong with what you're doing."
"9097840","9099300"," Yeah, your thesis is wrong. "
"9104600","9107120"," You know, was that buying calls today up here?"
"9108020","9108800"," Fuck no."
"9110640","9112180"," Nice big leg down."
"9112360","9113380"," Yeah, buy some calls in there. "
"9113760","9115040"," Nice big leg down."
"9115660","9117780"," Not as big as the last one."
"9117880","9119020"," You can even see it right here. "
"9119940","9120220"," Right?"
"9120420","9122340"," The amount is less right here, right?"
"9125840","9128080"," What are my expectations down here?"
"9128440","9130100"," Probably less than this move right here."
"9130320","9130880"," Like this move."
"9133320","9138540"," I'm probably not expecting too much more, right?"
"9138540","9139260"," Maybe there. "
"9139360","9140200"," Maybe if I'm lucky."
"9142720","9144220"," Then why the fuck would I?"
"9144260","9145400"," Why the fuck would I just?"
"9145580","9151680"," Why would I diamond hand to pin strike when I'm already up like three, four dollars?"
"9152300","9156180"," When I can just buy some 25 cent calls, put the risk, put the risk on."
"9157280","9157920"," Excuse me. "
"9159340","9161420"," Put the risk on for this downsize move."
"9163680","9165360"," So there's a rejection here, right?"
"9165360","9166880"," So the move is down."
"9173220","9181280"," If the move was up here, you'd want to see green bars, the white line trade sideways, a move up,"
"9181740","9184420"," back down to test, and then we get the move higher here. "
"9191020","9201120"," And you're watching the vix in the background and the HYG and the Dixie and XLF and XLK and all"
"9201120","9201860"," that fun stuff."
"9206300","9210940"," And you remember in the algos down here, they want that shiny piece of silver down, that shiny"
"9210940","9211880"," piece of gold, I guess."
"9213040","9215440"," Down there, they're like, I gotta have it, I gotta have it. "
"9215440","9216640"," It's a known number, I know it."
"9248060","9250400"," But I apologize, I use the app for it too much."
"9252180","9252640"," My bad. "
"9255550","9256350"," I need to start."
"9256530","9259450"," I need to start a subscription so they don't swear anymore."
"9267460","9268740"," I need to get paid. "
"9270640","9273920"," I need to get paid so that I don't swear."
"9276240","9277220"," That's what I should do."
"9289010","9295920"," I need to start charging so I don't swear. "
"9297820","9299800"," I need to get a Lambo man and a G4."
"9299800","9305920"," I need to wear like a suit."
"9308720","9316170"," I need to start acting like I'm somebody I'm not. "
"9316910","9318390"," I need to start selling an image."
"9319150","9320570"," I got imaged up hold around here."
"9322570","9323950"," If not, I'm gonna fake it. "
"9324290","9325570"," Create a fake ass image."
"9328190","9329270"," I bet you I'd have more followers."
"9338340","9341180"," I'm not here to make money. "
"9351450","9357790"," I should part my hair to the right."
"9363730","9365930"," Get some diamond in those glasses."
"9370120","9371760"," I got an imaged up hold here. "
"9371920","9373280"," I got some subs to sell."
"9379280","9381080"," Yeah, I gotta get my avocado toast."
"9387470","9389370"," Like two and a half years of doing this. "
"9392290","9393250"," Three years, I think."
"9394350","9395570"," I think we're coming on three years."
"9395730","9396090"," I'm not sure. "
"9396490","9397390"," I don't know, it's somewhere in there."
"9397910","9399570"," I'm gonna find out how long it's been."
"9399750","9400930"," It feels like it wasn't that long. "
"9400930","9401570"," I don't know."
"9411420","9411940"," Cartier's."
"9417150","9418750"," Yeah, I don't like swearing on stream. "
"9420390","9421470"," I'm not a fan of it."
"9421590","9422490"," Guess what I have here?"
"9424750","9426250"," I have a sign."
"9427710","9432050"," It says, it's Becky quick and she says, Jim, why are you cursing?"
"9433910","9435170"," It's like Becky quick. "
"9435530","9437430"," She's like stop cursing, man."
"9448740","9449800"," Becky quick, man."
"9449960","9451420"," She's like, don't swear, Jim. "
"9451980","9453980"," She's like, you have to present yourself to public."
"9457140","9462060"," You know, I think if I was a losing trader, maybe I would have to."
"9465080","9469720"," If I was broke, I probably would have to not swear. "
"9481040","9481460"," Right?"
"9481720","9483320"," I think that's what I would have to do."
"9487610","9489670"," If someone was like paying me, right?"
"9492150","9494610"," Someone's paying me, they're like, you can't swear."
"9494850","9496270"," I'd be like, you pay my bills, definitely. "
"9497790","9498210"," Done."
"9510080","9515920"," Have you guys ever, have you guys ever been in a boiler room?"
"9516740","9517260"," Have you guys ever been in a boiler room?"
"9517260","9518600"," Have you guys ever been in a trading desk?"
"9521280","9522660"," Have you guys ever been in a pit?"
"9536860","9537520"," Anybody out there?"
"9537700","9538500"," I know some of you have."
"9548000","9555450"," Now, these are not what I, like, you know, like, some of you have. "
"9555610","9558950"," I know some, I know some people in here that are on incognito that have been."
"9559890","9561210"," So get some friends that are pit traders."
"9561530","9562830"," You got some friends that are professional traders. "
"9564470","9565630"," What do you guys think it's like in there?"
"9568030","9572460"," Do you guys think it's like a, be honest with me?"
"9572540","9574920"," Do you guys think that you go in a boiler room in your life?"
"9575160","9578760"," People are like, swear jars over there."
"9595460","9597840"," Could you please tell me some shares good, sir?"
"9599240","9605350"," Do you guys ever see the, you guys want to see something fun?"
"9605550","9606370"," I mean, this isn't fun."
"9607130","9608410"," I don't condone this. "
"9612270","9613550"," You want to see something funny, though?"
"9618700","9620260"," Have you ever seen this right here?"
"9622940","9632880"," This is these 14 trainer hand signals are an HR rep's worst nightmare."
"9633140","9635720"," We need to hire that person as our human resources person."
"9636980","9639060"," Whoever was saying that earlier, we need to hire you. "
"9639180","9641080"," I need a human resources person around here."
"9649980","9652340"," Then I was like checking the hours that I stream."
"9652540","9653980"," Someone was like, you swear a lot. "
"9654300","9656220"," Like, is YouTube going to demonetize you?"
"9656940","9659960"," I was like, how much does that make on YouTube on that video?"
"9660180","9661400"," And they were like, $4."
"9661940","9663000"," I'm like, let's keep swearing."
"9665280","9667320"," And then they were like, I was like, well, keeps it right. "
"9667600","9670740"," But I don't actually get demonetized because it's like so many swears per hour."
"9671180","9673180"," Like, first five minutes, first hour."
"9673960","9677460"," When you do like six, seven, eight hours, I'm going to curse like a sailor. "
"9678640","9682360"," This is the, this is a business insider offensive trainer hand signals."
"9683320","9685700"," CVOT, hand yanks and imaginary news."
"9686280","9687860"," Play on the, yeah, that's bad. "
"9687860","9688620"," Can't talk about that one."
"9689900","9691900"," Touching the nose with index finger or thumb."
"9692760","9693780"," Can't touch that one. "
"9693840","9694820"," I'm not going to talk about that one."
"9695900","9696920"," That's a bad one too."
"9697440","9697920"," Oh, man. "
"9698740","9699380"," Good body."
"9701140","9702240"," What is that one for?"
"9702920","9703740"," Oh, that's bad too."
"9703740","9705980"," Like, this is some bad shit right here. "
"9706860","9708080"," None of this stuff is good."
"9710060","9712460"," A chemical bank injecting heroin."
"9713000","9713760"," We can talk about that one. "
"9716060","9716940"," A brokerage."
"9717780","9718420"," That's bad too."
"9718960","9720180"," I mean, let's look at this stuff here. "
"9724300","9725180"," This one right here."
"9725540","9727540"," Hand mimics holding a glass and drinking from it."
"9727720","9729120"," Farmers are known for drinking a lot. "
"9731380","9736000"," Now, Goldman Sachs, index finger extended pointing towards air and wiggling at risk."
"9736000","9737680"," I mean, these are some really gnarly things, man."
"9738400","9743200"," This is like some stuff that, uh, this is some stuff that you guys can look up on your own,"
"9743300","9745940"," but these are actually old school trader hand signals. "
"9746880","9748220"," And they're very offensive."
"9748660","9749040"," They're not nice."
"9749260","9751300"," This is on business insider.com."
"9751600","9751960"," Offensive. "
"9752760","9753160"," These 14."
"9754880","9757920"," Trader hand signals are an HRF's worst nightmare."
"9758180","9760340"," So, like, say in the F word or the S word or the A word. "
"9760820","9765660"," Uh, saying the S word, like in the F word."
"9766260","9767000"," That kind of stuff."
"9768560","9770840"," Uh, versus what used to be acceptable. "
"9772400","9772980"," I don't know, man."
"9773180","9773980"," Like, where do you draw the line?"
"9774460","9776560"," Like, I'm not into that stuff."
"9777920","9780440"," I don't talk about that stuff, and I don't say those words ever. "
"9780720","9781700"," I don't show those things."
"9782280","9785440"," Um, like, that stuff's offensive."
"9787860","9789400"," Well, that stuff's really offensive. "
"9789700","9791860"," So, if I say, like, an F word or an S word or an A word."
"9794820","9797770"," Uh, you know."
"9800010","9801170"," What are you looking for?"
"9806400","9808180"," I think those streamers are out there. "
"9808820","9809640"," I know they are."
"9811340","9812560"," Those YouTubers are out there."
"9814940","9816960"," So, I think there's an audience for them. "
"9822780","9825380"," And I don't, like, I don't think that's a bad thing to have that audience."
"9826160","9827600"," Like, I have that audience."
"9827840","9828480"," I want that audience. "
"9828720","9828940"," That's good."
"9830820","9839200"," Uh, the cool part is that, uh, my audience isn't 30 of my friends in my neighborhood."
"9840280","9841740"," My audience is the world. "
"9841980","9843080"," I've got people to watch me in Europe."
"9843640","9845320"," I have people to watch me in South America."
"9845720","9847340"," I have people to watch me in the Middle East. "
"9848160","9849320"," I have people to watch me in Asia."
"9850020","9851380"," I have people to watch me in the United States."
"9852860","9854100"," It's billions of people. "
"9855480","9858720"," So, if my stream is not for you, go elsewhere."
"9861140","9862820"," There are plenty of streamers out there."
"9863860","9866400"," Now, that might be, like, what the content you want. "
"9867760","9869940"," But my audience is not 30 people from my neighborhood."
"9871680","9872940"," My audience is the world."
"9873540","9874940"," So, this might not be for you. "
"9875620","9879080"," It might be for the other billions of people out there."
"9879600","9880680"," A small portion of them."
"9887460","9888680"," Happy Friday, everybody. "
"9896280","9897260"," Ireland, baby."
"9899360","9900040"," That's right."
"9900240","9900920"," I should have said Ireland. "
"9901960","9902400"," In Scotland."
"9907700","9908060"," It's hard to go."
"9918140","9919440"," I went by peeps, man. "
"9920780","9924220"," I've been hanging out in this stream for three years with a lot of these people."
"9926640","9927360"," Every day."
"9929860","9930820"," Three years almost. "
"9931220","9931840"," So, it's not quite three."
"9931960","9932880"," I think it's two and a half, but."
"9933620","9934760"," And before that, we hung out. "
"9935600","9936980"," You think I'm going to give up my people?"
"9939640","9940300"," Fuck no."
"9951980","9954220"," That's why I keep everything off site too."
"9954340","9954840"," That's why we got a website. "
"9980040","9981240"," 409-31."
"9983160","9986440"," Let's get down there and slap that 408-86, please."
"9991090","9993370"," Come on down and slap it for me. "
"9999630","10002990"," Come on down and slap it for me."
"10009280","10011480"," Come on down and slap it."
"10012900","10013980"," Slap it for me. "
"10030190","10032150"," Yeah, Wiki's like for nine."
"10032410","10033810"," I swear to God, you all do."
"10034970","10038170"," I'll start charging $1,000 a month and I kid you not. "
"10040030","10041790"," You'll never hear me swear again."
"10041950","10045510"," I'll hire somebody with a button that just beeps it."
"10045510","10048030"," Beep, beep, beep, beep. "
"10051230","10054970"," I'll start selling real estate courses and NFTs."
"10060710","10061430"," It'll be awesome."
"10061570","10062370"," You'll have plenty of fun. "
"10063170","10064670"," I'll never answer anyone in the chat."
"10084040","10085860"," I'm for sale, man."
"10088660","10092870"," Like, what is that?"
"10093210","10094170"," What was that movie?"
"10094470","10095410"," I forget the other movie was. "
"10103990","10105710"," I'm reading both your chats right now."
"10106050","10106770"," YouTube and Twitch."
"10110070","10112550"," Almost a full tag down there at S2. "
"10112850","10114310"," I might have this wrong."
"10114910","10115330"," Let me check."
"10115610","10117550"," Well, not wrong, but I snapped the line and didn't. "
"10118310","10119830"," Sometimes I throw the lines up there."
"10120290","10122250"," They don't pay attention to the exact number."
"10122530","10123090"," It's pretty close. "
"10123390","10126790"," Let me look and see for the exact S2 support number."
"10150720","10152060"," Pivot point 411."
"10152580","10154380"," Pivot point, starting bad. "
"10156100","10157500"," Pivot point is way up there."
"10158000","10162060"," S2 is 409.05. It's even lower."
"10164420","10165060"," That's 04. "
"10169160","10170620"," Let's take a look at it."
"10172980","10180640"," We got the 409.09, but not quite to the Pivot at 409.05. There it is right there."
"10180960","10182620"," That's the exact S2 right there. "
"10193420","10197200"," I can't wait until someone gets mad that I'm drinking a bear on stream."
"10198680","10199700"," You're working, bro."
"10205660","10207200"," Sign up for my feet picks. "
"10207660","10208520"," Only fans, please."
"10209840","10210260"," Sir."
"10226010","10227850"," Dude, should I do a bear bong right now?"
"10227950","10230910"," Maybe I can make a homemade bear bong and just start chugging bears on stream. "
"10235170","10239580"," Get me that last tick down here, dude."
"10239760","10240600"," Come on, algorithm."
"10248020","10248960"," Come on, computer. "
"10249700","10250740"," Give me that last tick, bro."
"10254600","10257760"," Yeah, it's this one right here, 408.86. See my cursor over there?"
"10258520","10259980"," This is where the algorithm wants to go."
"10260080","10262980"," It's 408.86. Or just threw it a little bit. "
"10263920","10265520"," Like normally just peek its head."
"10266620","10268140"," I don't know if we're going to get it, but I want to get it."
"10274380","10275700"," Should we do bear rips here?"
"10275840","10276880"," I'll do a bear rip with you. "
"10278040","10280100"," I wonder what the sponsors will think of that."
"10283860","10285180"," I'll probably get fired."
"10288520","10294220"," You guys think the sponsors will fire me if I start doing my start shotgun and bears on stream?"
"10309110","10312770"," Should I check with the sponsors and see if I'll get I'll get banned?"
"10314350","10321340"," I don't have any sponsors. "
"10322760","10330140"," I don't have any sponsors to be fired from."
"10347710","10349010"," No, no, we're going to look at it."
"10349090","10349770"," It's only two o'clock. "
"10349930","10351050"," We'll look at next week around three."
"10354210","10357350"," Cancel Jim James for drinking for shotgun and bears on a Friday."
"10361910","10363690"," I can't shotgun a bear in here. "
"10363930","10367330"," I've got like right now I've got like $15,000 in equipment."
"10367670","10368330"," I can't do that."
"10368910","10373830"," I'm about to roll in another like three grand of equipment, so there's no way I'm doing that. "
"10383150","10384590"," Sponsored by raid shadow legends."
"10398840","10401720"," Yeah, if we can get down here, I'd like to get one last buy."
"10401960","10402860"," I want to put in down here. "
"10405560","10407260"," I'm just hoping that we can get down here."
"10407360","10408420"," I want to see just that."
"10408420","10410540"," But I don't want like would you know what really suck?"
"10411980","10418800"," Is like if we don't get down there, if it's like this nonsense, like I'm always I'm afraid of this. "
"10419880","10423300"," And then you get it like right at four p.m. That would that would be terrible."
"10424260","10427360"," Like you like wait all day long and it doesn't even come."
"10443980","10446340"," I got some 410 C set up again. "
"10455500","10457940"," This box is supposed to follow this one right here."
"10464200","10465200"," That's enough hijinks."
"10465960","10467400"," Let's get serious around here. "
"10472400","10475760"," For the first time in some time, we're going to look at some really cool here."
"10476560","10477680"," So I got some good for you guys."
"10478520","10479380"," This is kind of good. "
"10487320","10488500"," We're going to look at this right now."
"10492600","10496460"," So for velocity, I always like the 30-minute velocity."
"10496520","10497120"," It's my favorite. "
"10500840","10504880"," I always like to see so winky if you pay attention to this wink."
"10509030","10512750"," I always like a firm like we're buying it."
"10513350","10516090"," I haven't seen that here, right?"
"10518510","10523110"," What's the difference between we like the half hours around here and the hour?"
"10523430","10526850"," We like the half hours because the hour in the stock market is on the 30. "
"10527770","10530530"," So I can't get an hour on the 30, right?"
"10530750","10534630"," Every hour on a program is from 9 to 10 to 11 to 12."
"10535210","10537690"," So the half hour, I add both together."
"10539270","10540970"," So right here is a key, right?"
"10542490","10543970"," Big difference here, right?"
"10544130","10544530"," You see that?"
"10546490","10548370"," You get the bar down on the half hour. "
"10548490","10550370"," You get the bar up on the half hour, right?"
"10550370","10553390"," Here, you got the bounce."
"10555070","10560070"," You got a red candle below, and now we're trying to hold to the downside."
"10561290","10562170"," Makes sense. "
"10563130","10566290"," So not as much conviction as we had back here, right?"
"10567450","10569730"," Not as much conviction here as over here."
"10571930","10573610"," This is the spy in a 30-minute."
"10577690","10579430"," We also know right here. "
"10579430","10587450"," We know that the daily can remain irrational longer than the hourly."
"10588030","10595690"," But even saying that, we see the previous examples of the topping on the daily, right?"
"10595970","10597370"," So we're getting a little long in the tooth."
"10597530","10598230"," We keep saying that. "
"10598770","10601370"," Spy's getting a little long in the tooth, right?"
"10602850","10605130"," Even so with it getting long in the tooth."
"10606470","10610170"," We know that we get some really nice, trainable hourlies."
"10611890","10615970"," Like, buy that dip, buy that dip, buy that dip down there. "
"10616170","10619510"," They print fat, dude, like boom, print, boom, print."
"10625680","10627400"," Gorgeous one over here, too, right?"
"10629160","10630180"," Boom, print."
"10633020","10633580"," Ripper. "
"10635140","10635700"," Ripper."
"10637240","10640530"," This is us going up."
"10640810","10642090"," This is the daily going up. "
"10643530","10645130"," Daily's still going up right now."
"10645950","10647550"," But it's getting long in velocity."
"10649030","10650610"," It's a little long in the tooth, right?"
"10653110","10656870"," We're extremely bearish on the five-minute right now in the 30-minute try. "
"10657090","10657650"," I want you to see this."
"10658750","10660050"," Extremely bearish right here."
"10662010","10666790"," But we're really getting started on the hourly bearishness down here. "
"10666790","10669630"," And this is now becoming bearish."
"10669670","10671110"," We're getting the zero line right now."
"10672090","10678750"," So we're almost at that place where we start to seek pitulation. "
"10681710","10686510"," You start seeing the bars going down on the daily."
"10686930","10689910"," You close a daily candle on the red."
"10693050","10695550"," Start closing down here like this. "
"10695550","10697950"," And this is like that capitulation phase."
"10700570","10701930"," So we're starting to see it."
"10701990","10702690"," It's looking good. "
"10702850","10703710"," If you're a bear, it's looking good."
"10703950","10705330"," Good progress for a bear."
"10707490","10710550"," Shitty progress in price for a bear. "
"10711690","10713590"," But good progress in like the down move."
"10717050","10719390"," Shitty progress in price, definitely."
"10722270","10725670"," Now, so any down move that we have, I'm going to expect that dip to be bought. "
"10726910","10727270"," I am."
"10727390","10728350"," I'm going to expect a full hardcore."
"10729270","10731210"," So we have some targets down below. "
"10735410","10736370"," 40246, 39797."
"10738210","10742390"," So most bearishness, I expect that I expect 40256."
"10743730","10744810"," That's as bearish as I get. "
"10747010","10749870"," A collapse to me is 39797."
"10752850","10753570"," That's a collapse."
"10758410","10760770"," Man, you see it's breaking underneath here right now. "
"10760970","10764530"," Now we do have some examples of us breaking down and then the dip being bought."
"10764810","10766790"," That's what I'm going to expect is something like that, the worst."
"10768810","10770210"," You can actually see it right here. "
"10772270","10776430"," See on this example of the red bar underneath, you have the green bar to confirm it, then the leg"
"10776430","10776790"," lower."
"10778530","10779690"," That could be in the Monday."
"10783500","10786700"," So this is going to be a key level here for bears. "
"10787420","10793280"," If you're a bear at home right now, the only thing you need to remember, if you want to go"
"10793280","10800760"," down even more, you just need spy to stay under today."
"10800760","10802860"," Stay under 40953."
"10804960","10805560"," 40953. "
"10805860","10806620"," Clutch for you."
"10813540","10814140"," VIX."
"10816060","10825890"," The previous example of VIX selling"
"10825890","10828950"," off on the weekly. "
"10830290","10832330"," Have not tested the monthly yet."
"10832590","10834350"," Remember we talked about pivots on the show all the time?"
"10837590","10840670"," Can we get through $20.28?"
"10841490","10841570"," Sure."
"10842350","10844310"," Do I think you get through the blue line?"
"10844830","10845330"," Hell no. "
"10847010","10850950"," I think we come back down and go out and do all this bullshit, even if we are going up."
"10853250","10854650"," So VIX target above."
"10855130","10861470"," If VIX can get above 18 and some change, which it has not been able to do. "
"10864610","10872590"," Your target above is about $20.50. Your target above that is $23."
"10873390","10878390"," So the max that I'm expecting, if you're like max bearish, still $23."
"10881850","10889830"," So what does that tell you if you're a bear means reduced volatility still?"
"10889830","10891730"," It means vol compression. "
"10892590","10900390"," If there's no expectation of VIX going above $23 right now at least, you're not going to expect big"
"10900390","10901410"," moves to the downside."
"10904250","10910890"," Now, if you're a claps bear, you need to get under $397.89 until next week."
"10913290","10918850"," It's a magic number for you, $397.89. You get underneath it and hold it. "
"10921050","10923210"," That's when you get VIX above $23."
"10930910","10933710"," You can always rewind this program, rewind."
"10935010","10937190"," It's $2.15 in the afternoon. "
"10937650","10943670"," So mark something at home and you can come back into the live stream and write down these numbers"
"10943670","10944590"," on VIX and spy."
"10944770","10945010"," They're important."
"10946370","10947530"," They're going to mean something. "
"10951850","10954270"," You see this daily trigger up here?"
"10954410","10955490"," This is very good for the bears."
"10955730","10958870"," They want to stay underneath this daily trigger."
"10968880","10971400"," Now, of course, I'm trying to counter trade this. "
"10978150","10979670"," I'm trying to buy a dip down here."
"10979790","10981010"," One more dip for Friday."
"10982330","10984450"," And I'm going to chart out next week for you. "
"10986010","11000520"," It's $2.16. I'm"
"11000520","11001500"," allowing some calls here."
"11003540","11006920"," I'm allowing 410 C's for, I think, 32 or 33 cents."
"11007280","11009800"," I can see what I got, grab the mat. "
"11023970","11043210"," $4.907. $2 "
"11043210","11046970",".17. Bears have another 13 minutes to get a new low."
"11047510","11049890"," So $2.30, they want to hit this low down here if they can."
"11071600","11073320"," I'm probably going to get stopped out of this trade. "
"11075120","11076260"," There's a fair chance of it."
"11094700","11095300"," Yeah, right."
"11095680","11096260"," Yeah, Winky. "
"11097180","11098300"," It's kind of crazy, right?"
"11099600","11101000"," No, I didn't see it in chat, brother."
"11102140","11107240"," So I wasn't watching chat because I switched back and forth from trying..."
"11107240","11110060"," My eyes are on these triggers in the background."
"11112000","11117870"," You know what?"
"11117950","11124070"," It's crazy, Winky, as it works even better on individual tickers, especially like high beta"
"11124070","11125730"," tickers, it works like crazy. "
"11143400","11145200"," Calls are flat right now, just sitting here."
"11156580","11158780"," There's like max puts in the market right now, too."
"11159800","11162900"," There's like 343,000 puts right now. "
"11168830","11170270"," I know they want to reverse this."
"11170470","11172190"," I know they want to get this last leg right here."
"11200150","11201590"," I got the chat back up, bro. "
"11203310","11205610"," Yeah, I'm probably going to get stopped out, I think, in just a minute."
"11207630","11209490"," I'm like one penny away from getting stopped out."
"11240620","11241560"," They're trying right now. "
"11241640","11242760"," I think I'm going to try to push this down."
"11250650","11251130"," frustrating."
"11251690","11261860"," I think VIX"
"11261860","11262420"," is just..."
"11262420","11264020"," VIX is ready to explode right now, bro. "
"11266300","11268200"," I'm probably going to get stopped out here just a second."
"11274460","11276460"," Now I'm two pennies away from being stopped out."
"11294200","11295040"," Green now. "
"11303850","11305090"," So fucking risky here."
"11318190","11319990"," Green baby green baby green."
"11321530","11329610"," I have a sell order in above. "
"11330910","11333610"," Yep, so I just got out of 37 cents."
"11336450","11339050"," Risky trade, but it's green, so I'm good."
"11339730","11340390"," I took a few points. "
"11341970","11343470"," I want better positioning."
"11345050","11346910"," I want down here."
"11349750","11352510"," I'm getting itchy like I just want to buy it right now. "
"11353170","11354570"," I don't want to get left behind."
"11355650","11358790"," I'm like, yeah, I probably should wait for this down here."
"11360950","11362570"," I'm looking at VIX right now, man. "
"11363350","11365190"," There's a new low on VIX, by the way."
"11365310","11369770"," We had a high on VIX at 2pm."
"11371070","11375670"," VIX trying to sit on its one minute trigger, and it had a failure to make a new high. "
"11375670","11387550"," Last 15 minutes from 2.13 until 2.22. We"
"11387550","11392530"," had a failure to make a new high in the last 15 minutes segment on VIX."
"11394810","11400750"," So I'm going to just stay flat right now at this moment, make sure that a prison one more red"
"11400750","11401730"," bar to death down here."
"11403370","11413320"," I probably shouldn't be looking for 4.10s. You should be looking at"
"11413320","11415060"," the 409s, but they're expensive. "
"11415360","11416580"," They're like 90 cents, 80 cents."
"11418540","11422340"," I want that 33 cent man ripped to like 60 or 70 or 80 cents."
"11423500","11424820"," I get 100% on that trade. "
"11444550","11446310"," VIX starting to roll off its one minute."
"11448790","11457150"," Next level down for VIX is 17.48. Is that a 17.66 right now?"
"11471640","11473200"," Yeah, it should break through Winky."
"11474840","11481020"," It should break through Winky at like a, it should break through 408.80. It should break like, it"
"11481020","11486660"," should break like 408, like 408.70 or something. "
"11487060","11490560"," Normally, when it goes through it, it's like with a little bit more conviction, but that's, it"
"11490560","11490940"," doesn't matter."
"11491500","11492440"," It's close enough."
"11493380","11497600"," It's like four pennies, three pennies, 20 pennies, fucking close enough. "
"11511400","11513920"," So Winky, watch a price underneath the one minute."
"11514040","11516520"," It'll go back and it'll test the five minute."
"11519040","11521140"," It'll go like VIX will test the five minute. "
"11523060","11523540"," And."
"11526740","11527140"," 225."
"11528160","11533600"," If you're a bull, you know that when it gets to be 225, 220 in the afternoon, the trade is"
"11533600","11534360"," usually over. "
"11535920","11537420"," Two o'clock in the afternoon, right?"
"11537580","11540580"," The bears take over and they run it down and for the next hour into the power."
"11546500","11550480"," Bears want to keep control of the daily trigger."
"11551320","11555940"," They do not want to see, sell side does not want to see in cash market. "
"11556420","11557420"," Price get above it."
"11559160","11566030"," I should have stayed in that fucking trade."
"11566190","11566990"," It would have made a lot of money. "
"11567910","11569690"," Oh, no, it's that 37 cents again."
"11569910","11573510"," I took it at 37, so it's not 38 cents."
"11573930","11574550"," So I did good. "
"11575330","11576230"," Made five cents."
"11576730","11578050"," I'm happy with it, ish."
"11583960","11584600"," It's a win. "
"11584860","11585320"," I'll take a win."
"11585760","11586300"," I'll take a W."
"11595380","11599300"," Yeah, VIX rolling over now trading 1761 target below for VIX."
"11600020","11605260"," It's like 1749, 1740 somewhere in there. "
"11611050","11613530"," Daily trigger and spies changed a little bit."
"11613670","11613990"," It's at."
"11624460","11626760"," 409.55. It's the same. "
"11627620","11629680"," So 409.55, remember that is."
"11633860","11635680"," Oh, yeah, that's bullish, baby."
"11639500","11647200"," First line of sellers right here at 409.90. Squeezing up above the daily trigger. "
"11658700","11659260"," Squeezing."
"11661340","11662940"," Shit, I should have stayed in that trade."
"11663360","11665180"," Portends now trading 45 cents. "
"11666580","11668840"," They were 32 cents just a moment ago."
"11671320","11673100"," Now trading 45 cents."
"11677630","11679510"," Now I always cut my shit too early. "
"11680750","11683450"," Trade in 47 cents on 410 C's."
"11684330","11688750"," If you are still along those calls, if you're like, fuck you, Cap, I stay, I dive in hand."
"11689010","11690050"," This is the place right here. "
"11691270","11692630"," Take the money and run here."
"11693790","11702510"," Reenter the trade for a target above of 411.57. Only if we break above the white line."
"11704650","11708770"," And it holds like break above and hold like conviction up, back down. "
"11710130","11711910"," Set the trade up somewhere in there."
"11712010","11713090"," I'll be setting this trade up."
"11713250","11714530"," If I can get in here, I will. "
"11720000","11720860"," Another squeeze."
"11721320","11721720"," Another dip."
"11721940","11723480"," Third dip to buy this afternoon. "
"11724600","11725260"," Buy a dip there."
"11725480","11726280"," Buy a dip there."
"11726520","11727340"," Buy a dip there. "
"11730100","11731420"," Calls built to print."
"11733380","11736540"," 410 C's now printing 50 cents."
"11737360","11739020"," They were 32 cents earlier. "
"11740160","11741880"," Just 10 minutes ago."
"11747140","11748300"," Three bars."
"11751640","11753260"," Almost 100% printer. "
"11754660","11756460"," They'll be 100% printer in just a minute."
"11758060","11761040"," 51 cents right now in 410 C's."
"11764900","11765940"," Three bars. "
"11768960","11770240"," Did I swear again?"
"11777990","11778730"," Thanks Kyle."
"11778870","11779550"," Oh, cowboy up."
"11781190","11782110"," Who did that?"

"11936010","11938030"," So I'm going to Lord Pentate is asking for Tesla."
"11938050","11939290"," We're going to do Tesla right now. "
"11940470","11941450"," And then I'll get a bear."
"11946560","11949120"," Spy fighting for its life right now."
"11949960","11951440"," Targets above on spy. "
"11951820","11951880"," Ready?"
"11953100","11954140"," Ooh doggy."
"11954380","11955700"," Four eleven eighty one."
"11956680","11959320"," Four eleven eighty one for the spy. "
"11960960","11965000"," Spy needs to get above this yellow bar for that to happen."
"11965200","11966280"," So watch my cursor here."
"11967540","11970800"," Spy if it can get above right here. "
"11970800","11973320"," Your target."
"11975640","11977100"," That's where the money trade is."
"11979260","11980960"," To the upside if it goes there. "
"11981080","11981740"," I don't think that it is."
"11981820","11982520"," I'll be honest with you."
"11983940","11985780"," Right up here four eleven eighty one. "
"11988060","11991800"," I don't think it's going there but if it shows in price we'll trade it."
"11993840","11995180"," Four eleven eighty one."
"11996240","11996980"," Upside target. "
"12009920","12010600"," Tesla."
"12012540","12013540"," Tesla beer."
"12015000","12016140"," By the dip on Tesla. "
"12016540","12019720"," Well market conditions say no Lord Pentate."
"12021840","12026840"," We're retesting the previous low on Tesla on Wednesday the tenth."
"12028700","12029800"," The eleventh. "
"12032480","12035940"," And we return to the scene of the crime on Tesla which is good to see."
"12037000","12038520"," So give you some positives on Tesla."
"12039360","12041120"," We return to the scene of the crime right. "
"12041660","12042780"," We had a big squeeze up."
"12043480","12044800"," We erased the entire move."
"12045440","12047580"," Same thing happens for bears right. "
"12047900","12050400"," If we if bears commit a crime we start selling down."
"12051000","12052240"," Leave a bunch of gaps behind."
"12052440","12057800"," You know we're coming back to close that and then start back in our original direction. "
"12059420","12062700"," Is there a squeeze play for Tesla you bet your ass there is."
"12065000","12067340"," If Tesla can get above and hold."
"12068100","12070000"," One sixty eight thirty eight. "
"12072420","12074180"," I don't think it's going to though man."
"12075220","12078100"," But if it can get above one sixty eight thirty eight."
"12078660","12081280"," Target above one seventy one sixteen. "
"12082920","12084700"," Expect like one seventy maybe."
"12086500","12088520"," If you get above one seventy one sixteen."
"12089340","12093580"," You're going to wait to rent to the next part of the trade above one seventy one ninety four. "
"12094280","12097920"," And then you'll close the gap above the one seventy six thirty three."
"12101100","12102900"," Now what's my take on Tesla."
"12110120","12113020"," Nothing has changed to the upside for Tesla. "
"12119960","12120520"," Nothing."
"12122360","12124540"," Velocity is on your side on the daily."
"12127080","12128720"," You're going to have some weakness here. "
"12129680","12131460"," The rest of the market is going to do its thing."
"12133020","12136320"," I would expect the worst case for Tesla down to one fifty two."
"12137500","12141060"," But if they do that like if you do hit that one fifty two is Dell bottom just check that"
"12141060","12141920"," we're going higher that's fine. "
"12148360","12151440"," The move is still to the upside for Tesla."
"12154660","12156040"," Am I bearish on Tesla?"
"12156400","12158300"," Fuck no I'm super bullish on Tesla."
"12162100","12166960"," Can Tesla trade like a beta stock while spy is going down?"
"12167600","12167680"," Yes. "
"12169240","12173740"," But you know if it hits one fifty two like right now you can't take the trade on Tesla."
"12174680","12175760"," You have to get above."
"12177900","12182720"," Price on Tesla has to get above one sixty nine. "
"12184820","12186840"," One sixty thirty nine."
"12187140","12189560"," And then you can take it to one seventy one eleven."
"12191620","12195760"," And then you go back into the trade of one seventy one one seventy two basically and then you can"
"12195760","12197960"," write it all the way up to one eighty six. "
"12198580","12201720"," But my take on Tesla is it's not bearish it's not bearish like spies."
"12204760","12211180"," Like the market like the like the market like spy needs to come down and cool off so that this"
"12211180","12212300"," can go up there a little bit."
"12215580","12218040"," I'm still bullish on some bullish on Tesla. "
"12218500","12220460"," Even outside of tech I'm bullish on Tesla."
"12221720","12224160"," Just a matter of just a matter of letting the market."
"12224540","12229760"," We are a blood pendant it's a matter of the market conditions not Tesla conditions. "
"12238420","12245440"," Well mark conditions not test conditions and then that squeeze higher for Tesla still points to the"
"12245440","12245780"," upside."
"12247880","12249980"," The direction of Tesla is up."
"12250920","12251980"," Believe it or not. "
"12252920","12254580"," Even if you like in panic today."
"12261600","12264500"," There's a matter of fact if a lord pantry remind me."
"12266720","12269160"," If Tesla at any point does trade down there. "
"12270700","12275360"," I will enter I was kicking myself for not buying it at a hundred fifty two."
"12275980","12280540"," I will buy that I'll buy the stock at one fifty two if we ever get down there like one"
"12280540","12282500"," fifty nine one fifty two I'll buy that shit."
"12284260","12286680"," And I'll hold it I made a mistake by selling man. "
"12288240","12289980"," Give me a big mistake I should have held."
"12291800","12296980"," Like I bought it I think one thirty two specifically change and I sold it at two seventeen."
"12297800","12299440"," I should have just held an ad to my position. "
"12300560","12301840"," So if you ever get down there again."
"12303380","12303940"," I'm with you bro."
"12305120","12306620"," I'm just going to start buying it accumulating. "
"12308900","12312460"," So I don't think we get down there but if we did I'm game on brother."
"12313200","12315700"," I'm bullish on Tesla over the market right now too."
"12320440","12322100"," It's just mark conditions man that's it. "
"12322460","12324260"," You got opeks coming out out next week."
"12329030","12332690"," Like underlying set alert to buy one fifty two somewhere down there."
"12332790","12333590"," I don't think we get that low. "
"12333830","12338250"," I think we get like maybe one fifty five the worst one sixty one one sixty two."
"12338350","12339410"," I don't think we even get down there."
"12339490","12343370"," I think that maybe Tesla trade sideways while the market does its thing. "
"12345370","12346370"," Maybe wrong there."
"12346910","12348970"," But the move is still up on Tesla's the key."
"12351870","12354990"," If we start selling Tesla like we're going down to sixty five bucks. "
"12355730","12356310"," I'll let you know."
"12357610","12358910"," I'm very bullish on Tesla."
"12362740","12366040"," Like intraday stuff aside doesn't doesn't mean shit about Tesla. "
"12367740","12371600"," I got a almost a hundred percent print on Tesla man it was fucking phenomenal."
"12373860","12375260"," Stoked on a stock."
"12378500","12381080"," So if I could have bought one fifty two I'd be holding right now. "
"12381080","12381600"," I wouldn't be selling."
"12384140","12386180"," I might have sold this open today."
"12386420","12386880"," I can't lie. "
"12387020","12387920"," I probably would have sold the open."
"12391960","12392780"," They can't lie."
"12392920","12393800"," I probably would have sold the open. "
"12397720","12398700"," I guess I'm lying."
"12398740","12399100"," I'm greedy."
"12402000","12404240"," I'd be like I have another chance to buy lower. "
"12406780","12408360"," But I'm not in like sell mode."
"12408720","12412460"," So like if you know Lord Pentey if you know Joe donut."
"12414520","12416520"," When I go in sell mode I'll tell you. "
"12417640","12422400"," Like I told you when I was in sell mode before like when I sell tops on Tesla I'm like"
"12422400","12424040"," full honest I'm like I'm out."
"12425380","12428880"," But if I was long right now from one fifty two I fucking be long still."
"12432670","12434990"," I'm like kicking myself I didn't buy one fifty two. "
"12435710","12439090"," We talked about that all week right I think I don't know if we talked about here I talked to"
"12439090","12440050"," Joe about it earlier in the week."
"12441250","12442890"," I'm going to kick myself or not."
"12443230","12446830"," I think Joe on the phone like three days ago I was like I'm fucking pissed I didn't buy that"
"12446830","12447410"," one fifty two. "
"12454300","12455460"," That was my mistake."
"12455460","12459200"," I was angry at I was angry at there."
"12460320","12465660"," Well you heard my diet tribe right I was angry at their earnings and the event that they had a"
"12465660","12468100"," couple events that they've had or I think it was one event. "
"12468900","12471460"," And then I was angry at that I was angry at their earnings."
"12472320","12475080"," Now you know you know my grievances are with Elon."
"12478080","12481660"," So I'm very bullish on Elon not being the CEO of Twitter. "
"12482220","12488020"," I'm very bullish on Tesla SpaceX and he's got someone running SpaceX supposedly too."
"12488140","12491420"," Well I know it's not confirmed confirmed deal."
"12499950","12504550"," But it's good it's it's overall best for all of it. "
"12505290","12511510"," Like public persona he's a even if he even if you like well he bought he bought a Tesla from"
"12511510","12513910"," a company he's still a startup guy that's what he is."
"12513910","12517970"," I like him in that role."
"12518250","12519150"," I like him focused. "
"12519630","12521130"," I really like him focused on."
"12522150","12524990"," It's like my my agreement with with Elon."
"12527290","12529410"," Wouldn't have been to like. "
"12530050","12533290"," I think I started trading Elon a decade ago something like that."
"12534890","12538010"," Or like like buying what he was proposing."
"12540870","12543650"," And what he proposed to me at least right took from it. "
"12545590","12546750"," Was we're going to push."
"12548630","12551550"," Now I know that all vehicles aren't going to ever."
"12551710","12554010"," I mean you guys will be like the tackle come out the tackle come out. "
"12554330","12556190"," I was in the military I've lived all over the world."
"12556990","12561290"," There's a place for fossil fuels even jet engines right."
"12562010","12564630"," We know that there's you know we're going to do with batteries. "
"12565250","12570250"," Well I guess we could with like big tech and hundreds and hundreds of years from now with a space"
"12570250","12570930"," elevator and shit."
"12571830","12573430"," Like you know we know realistically."
"12574510","12580550"," But the idea of getting a lot of the country in the world pushing forward and electric in EVs where"
"12580550","12583950"," they are logical to use which is most applications. "
"12585190","12586250"," I bought into that."
"12586470","12587130"," I'm like I'm in."
"12588150","12591970"," When he talked about the fears of AI years ago. "
"12592490","12593590"," I bought into that."
"12593750","12594790"," I bought into Starlink."
"12594970","12596250"," I bought into Starlink. "
"12596790","12598950"," I bought into Tesla."
"12599730","12600510"," I bought into SpaceX."
"12601730","12603370"," And I bought into a Neuralink. "
"12603630","12604230"," I'm on that."
"12605270","12607190"," What I didn't sign up for was social media."
"12608850","12610270"," And he proposed that. "
"12611110","12614090"," We're even creating that fife them to survive down the road."
"12614310","12615670"," I see it like yeah I get it."
"12616450","12619350"," I get that that's a part of the puzzle when AI actually takes over. "
"12619350","12621210"," I get that that's a part of it."
"12622330","12623690"," But I didn't sign up for that part."
"12634330","12635250"," So I'm happy. "
"12635550","12638510"," I'm happy that possibly he'd leave that to."
"12639230","12640330"," Twitter's already been developed."
"12641150","12643450"," Twitter needs like a CEO that knows how to CEO. "
"12645930","12648930"," I've heard all the arguments between yesterday and today about."
"12649950","12652410"," They're gonna bankrupt Twitter and blame the CEO."
"12652710","12653390"," I've heard all that shit. "
"12653630","12654930"," I don't care if they do or don't."
"12657350","12658990"," If he wanted to like CEO."
"12659270","12661350"," If he wanted to launch or buy a startup. "
"12661870","12662430"," Social media."
"12663170","12664950"," I wouldn't be so cranky about it."
"12665130","12666090"," Like just don't mess with Twitter. "
"12666350","12668270"," Twitter needs mess with."
"12668510","12670470"," But it's already an established company."
"12670670","12673470"," Get someone in there that can put the things out there that they've always wanted. "
"12682550","12683430"," You guys know."
"12683550","12684790"," I think you guys understand what I'm saying."
"12685510","12687570"," Like a lot I'm focusing on getting to Mars, man. "
"12688490","12690990"," I want to see like the boring company."
"12690990","12694190"," People are like, no one wants tunnels underneath the city."
"12694330","12696190"," I'm like, I'm not thinking about tunnels under a city. "
"12696330","12697450"," I'm thinking about tunnels under Mars."
"12699110","12699550"," Seriously."
"12701830","12704990"," I care less about tunnels in the country. "
"12707490","12710870"," And even if it is an Elon that does it, you need that third player."
"12713910","12717370"," You guys hear me all the time say that I compare him to Howard Hughes."
"12718810","12722950"," You know, if you're building aircraft for a war, you'd have like four G."
"12723170","12725030"," I mean, I'm using an example. "
"12725570","12729630"," Like Boeing, McDonald Douglas, you'd have like all these companies."
"12730490","12732550"," That are normies, right?"
"12733650","12735770"," So they go in a room with like, or let's say I'm hiking."
"12736630","12737350"," I'm backpacking. "
"12737690","12738210"," I'm through hiking."
"12740990","12742830"," And I don't know what to do next."
"12743450","12745570"," And like four of us are there. "
"12745570","12748950"," And three of us know the normal things to do."
"12749790","12752490"," And we're not novel."
"12755330","12757070"," You know, this doesn't be an engineer. "
"12757290","12758050"," It just has to be novel."
"12758510","12759850"," Like, hey, I can't put something."
"12760870","12762150"," You need that person there. "
"12762270","12766090"," It doesn't mean that that's the correct way to do something, but you do need that outside the box"
"12766090","12766390"," thinker."
"12767850","12770090"," Or someone that can push an idea or a thought."
"12771530","12773190"," Because if you don't, you know what you wind up like?"
"12773910","12777790"," As a country, we wind up as like another emperor wears no clothes. "
"12778150","12778610"," That's not Elon."
"12778890","12779310"," That's us."
"12780730","12782670"," We don't want to be wearing no clothes. "
"12783650","12785730"," That's how you find like crackpot countries."
"12786430","12789210"," Like when you're like an example would be Russia."
"12790190","12791670"," You know, Russia went into this war. "
"12792030","12795370"," And I mean, I know there's some argument that they're using their old equipment, but you really"
"12795370","12798430"," find out that they're not the tiger that they were purported to be."
"12800550","12801990"," And that's because of fraud."
"12802270","12803250"," And that's because of lies. "
"12803690","12806990"," And that's because of no real development."
"12807090","12811050"," And we have fraud and lies and no real development in our country, but not to the extent that it"
"12811050","12811470"," could be."
"12813070","12818510"," We must push the envelope for always. "
"12818930","12822890"," And whenever Elon's done being that guy, we're going to have someone else that we need to put in"
"12822890","12823250"," his place."
"12824650","12829810"," So there'll always be or should always be, there might not always be, but there should always be"
"12829810","12831690"," someone like that."
"12835020","12838660"," We need a Howard Hughes every, every 20, 30, 50 years. "
"12848880","12849800"," That's my view though."
"12849900","12851960"," I know you guys don't agree with this, but I do."
"12852440","12853540"," That's what I bought into. "
"12856220","12858620"," So I find the Twitter thing to be positive."
"12869440","12870580"," We must go."
"12875550","12876850"," 248 right now. "
"12879350","12880770"," Failure to get a new low."
"12882610","12885450"," At 245, there was a failure to get a new low."
"12885630","12886430"," That's not good for bears. "
"12888190","12894610"," Bears don't want to see that weakness in the will to sell for the bears at 245."
"12899580","12901120"," I'm going to go get a bear right now."
"12902180","12903200"," I'll be right back. "
"13104160","13105080"," Oh, yeah."
"13105900","13107840"," Failure to get a new low on."
"13108360","13111880"," Failure to get a new low on spy at 245. "
"13113820","13115440"," Swift reversal to the upside."
"13125590","13126410"," Let's see here."
"13126490","13127330"," I got brought two bears. "
"13128110","13129150"," Got my own bears today."

"13358610","13359230"," Vicks, dude."
"13359750","13360750"," In free fall, right?"
"13361070","13361530"," Oh, dude."
"13361670","13362190"," I got to buy this. "
"13368280","13368800"," Give me."
"13368880","13369100"," Give me."
"13369180","13369680"," Give me. "
"13369680","13370140"," Let me buy this."
"13370280","13370660"," Hold on here."
"13373240","13374320"," Hold on here. "
"13385930","13386330"," Easy."
"13401000","13401920"," It's not this candle."
"13402160","13403300"," It's the next one that's important. "
"13404440","13419020"," I need"
"13419020","13421920"," that rejection on the Vicks up there and the five minute and Vicks winky."
"13422320","13422920"," Take a look at it."
"13431560","13433360"," Do we bloodbath the clothes?"
"13438470","13440610"," Are the bears foiled again?"
"13448680","13449760"," I'll take that bit. "
"13461570","13474310"," I mean, market wants"
"13474310","13474910"," to know."
"13479220","13480420"," Make it money again."
"13504400","13506120"," We're going to find out in two minutes. "
"13512150","13515530"," Do we get buy.exe or sell.exe?"
"13516590","13519490"," These shorts wrap it up heading into Friday."
"13520330","13521710"," Or do they pin it into Monday?"
"13524310","13533170"," What's really crazy, too, is we're at $4.96. We're at $4.98. Aren't we at the same price as"
"13533170","13534030"," yesterday or something?"
"13535810","13536950"," We're a little bit under it."
"13537630","13538170"," We have a new low. "
"13538370","13538650"," That's good."
"13540030","13544670"," At three o'clock, I'll give you guys a look at what to expect next week."
"13547130","13549050"," Coming into mopecs next week. "
"13549750","13550970"," We got a lot of bears out there."
"13551030","13553750"," They're like, we're going to crash into mopecs."
"13555670","13556670"," I'm like, what's crash?"
"13557310","13557790"," Hey, buddy. "
"13560330","13561290"," What are you doing here?"
"13561450","13568130"," My dog's with me right now."
"13580900","13583040"," It's at three o'clock right now, right?"
"13583680","13585820"," We got a new high the last five minutes."
"13585820","13588740"," I really like to see a convincing push higher right now. "
"13592600","13593980"," Right in this minute right now."
"13594020","13596080"," This is zero minute that we have under a minute right now."
"13596080","13597540"," I want to see a convincing push higher. "
"13606850","13608750"," This is the candle that's important to me."
"13609910","13610930"," This one right here."
"13644270","13645310"," Okay, three oh one. "
"13650340","13651840"," Last hour for next week."
"13652120","13656860"," Here is your next week expectations."
"13664380","13667940"," You guys are all deciding the fate of the world on a one minute and five minute chart. "
"13680030","13684310"," Next week we have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, right?"
"13684570","13685570"," That's the big day, Thursday."
"13686190","13687370"," This is where they like to pin shit."
"13688730","13692290"," You know, you could trade the whole entire wall on the quarter. "
"13694710","13697230"," We have like like big quarterly expectations."
"13699030","13704930"," Then every month in that quarter, these are institutions I'm talking about."
"13705590","13710190"," Then these institutions have their own expectations. "
"13712230","13715710"," As each month in that quarter changes, they'll re hedge."
"13717090","13721010"," To the upside or the downside depending upon conditions, right?"
"13721210","13722730"," Like market conditions, things they don't know."
"13724190","13729690"," Like let's say, hey, I'm betting that we go to our 4300 and then two months pass and they're like,"
"13729790","13733790"," ooh, we got some volatility possibly towards the end of that quarter. "
"13733990","13735790"," Maybe we're going to lower expectations, right?"
"13736130","13737170"," So bears are looking for that."
"13740090","13742770"," We also know that that bearish trade."
"13744310","13750170"," You have the initial, you will have an initial impact on those puts being bought into their"
"13750170","13751230"," Thursday here, right?"
"13751410","13752230"," Maybe here. "
"13752950","13754730"," You'll have initial reaction, right?"
"13755450","13760650"," But you might not get the waterfall, so the dealers will delta hedge that trade."
"13761290","13763130"," So be aware of that into next week."
"13769190","13773690"," The one thing that we do know is that we've been in what's called balance, right?"
"13774730","13779470"," We know that we've been consolidating here. "
"13780990","13784890"," We know that bears say things like, well, we want to close the gaps down here."
"13787490","13792350"," You know, because they want to win, right?"
"13792570","13793010"," I get that."
"13794210","13796810"," But we're not bearish if we close these gaps, are we?"
"13797770","13801390"," We're not bearish if we touch, if we go as low as 392. "
"13802970","13804130"," We're not bearish."
"13804310","13805810"," That's just continuation of trend."
"13809640","13811480"," We're in a four hour chart, right?"
"13811580","13813680"," It's been kind of like, kind of like clockwork, right?"
"13816000","13816820"," Buy the dip. "
"13817600","13818100"," Sell the rip."
"13818620","13819040"," Buy the dip."
"13819440","13820180"," Sell the rip. "
"13820940","13821640"," Buy the dip."
"13822780","13826060"," Do you buy $100,000 in calls here?"
"13826240","13826660"," Fuck no."
"13826660","13829820"," You know, do you buy them down here?"
"13830000","13831860"," Probably with some stops on them. "
"13832000","13833180"," Pretty good trade, right?"
"13833380","13834380"," It's been working quite well."
"13836140","13838300"," And this is what the bears are hoping for, right?"
"13839140","13840860"," Bears like to come into OPEC's cap."
"13840860","13841540"," We're going to sell. "
"13844220","13849640"," The plan here though is that these bears, these sellers are like, oh, they think we're going to"
"13849640","13850400"," bounce down here."
"13850460","13853000"," We're going to go balls deep in the death blow."
"13854060","13855800"," We're going to get that volatility trade. "
"13857780","13859680"," And the debt ceiling is not going to get solved."
"13860780","13866540"," So as we come into this OPEC's and you're considering that trade, I have a few warnings for you."
"13870330","13873870"," There'll be a counter trade until you get the waterfall trade. "
"13874010","13874590"," It's not going to print."
"13875750","13879130"," If they solve the debt ceiling at any point, your trade is fucked."
"13879870","13883990"," Well, we'll make go down initially on it. "
"13883990","13885710"," That's like a squeeze higher on the good news."
"13885710","13890210"," We might go down to print some of this shit, but then we'll squeeze way higher, right?"
"13891910","13894810"," Now, if you're relying upon this trade here, I do."
"13895170","13896990"," I don't think it's a sure thing is my point. "
"13897290","13899630"," So again, I'll say it again."
"13901510","13903150"," Ratio spreads to your friend."
"13906680","13911460"," Some put spreads are nice here, but I wouldn't have an expectation of going lower than here. "
"13912460","13915360"," So they put spreads for this trade lower."
"13917040","13920660"," Ratio spreads, though, will print like crazy if we go down here."
"13921700","13924100"," If there are any points, good news and we go up. "
"13926480","13930140"," Your ratio spreads will print like 10%, 5%."
"13930140","13931800"," You would have lost not a dollar."
"13932840","13933920"," It's a free trade. "
"13935000","13937760"," You can think of ratio spread for a free trade down here."
"13939120","13940880"," For that bloodbath you're expecting."
"13942360","13943740"," I post them on Twitter. "
"13944480","13947080"," I post the video on how to trade that."
"13947860","13948960"," It's very easy."
"13949120","13951140"," The Options Industry Council puts that trade out. "
"13952200","13961580"," If you take that trade and you're looking for the X date on the Wall Street, it's sometime in mid "
"13961580","13961880","-June."
"13962060","13963880"," I forget the exact date, but it's mid-June."
"13968030","13975490"," If you're like, I'm going to buy puts, they should be like July or August in case you get delta"
"13975490","13976370"," hedged in that trade. "
"13978570","13979790"," They should be more in the money."
"13982590","13984070"," So just that stuff there."
"13984370","13987690"," Now, we also have this balance that we had back here. "
"13987750","13988430"," I want you to see this."
"13990450","13992130"," We had this balance here, right?"
"13992390","13994390"," This zone that we traded, right?"
"13994710","13996530"," Trade it up, trade it down, get down here."
"13996670","13997910"," See how you have to get under?"
"13999550","14000710"," That's a second trade. "
"14001390","14005110"," Relief rally, rejection, boom, down."
"14005910","14008790"," Think of this same stuff here, right?"
"14009010","14010710"," You want to be like a tactful trader."
"14011150","14017230"," So if we get underneath these lows, you know that's the next leg of the trade, right?"
"14017230","14021590"," One leg of the trade, two legs of the trade, three legs of the trade. "
"14024610","14028130"," So just even here, let's look at this stuff here."
"14044850","14047690"," This is your first leg to the downside over here."
"14048690","14052110"," Dude, my fucking calls are printing fat as fuck right now. "
"14053010","14054450"," I'm making money, dude."
"14054710","14055910"," I'm making some bank right now."
"14056010","14058110"," I'm not looking at a chart right now. "
"14058110","14061850"," I'm just looking at my brokerage and I'm printing, baby."
"14062370","14064750"," Let's go back to the one minute second."
"14065070","14066510"," Oh, yeah. "
"14069590","14070550"," Oh, yeah."
"14077030","14078070"," Oh, yeah."
"14080670","14083450"," Now the VIX is coming into the hourly right now. "
"14083530","14085030"," I'm probably going to take the money and run here."
"14086490","14088390"," Thank you very much for my free money."
"14089590","14090390"," I'll take it. "
"14096310","14101030"," If the target is 480, right, the VIX is coming into support right now in the hourly trigger."
"14101190","14101910"," Just a warning here."
"14104550","14105210"," Right here. "
"14105290","14106210"," I just wanted you to see this."
"14106930","14113710"," VIX, trading down to its hourly trigger at 17.08. I expect a bounce on the VIX at some point."
"14119230","14120610"," I'm getting bull lirts here. "
"14120730","14121690"," Why am I getting a bull alert?"
"14121930","14122990"," Because of this right here."
"14123790","14124510"," Bull cross."
"14126050","14135760"," So the second part of this trade is hopefully"
"14135760","14136760"," a successful. "
"14137260","14141660"," Hopefully, sometimes we don't get it, but if we get a successful test and then we move up here,"
"14141720","14143380"," that's where big money is right there."
"14148000","14150500"," So keep your eyes on that one right there, okay?"
"14151120","14152420"," Thank you for the free money again."
"14152620","14153260"," I appreciate it. "
"14156880","14158580"," I love free money."
"14164020","14170730"," Chase is making a very good point."
"14171670","14173770"," Chase said you want to short that squeeze. "
"14175230","14177010"," There's two shorts on that squeeze."
"14178210","14182030"," You want to short the squeeze if we squeeze up on debt ceiling, definitely."
"14182710","14191770"," And if there's a delta hedge trade against the initial rolling in, puts rolling in and shorts go to"
"14191770","14195090"," the market, if there's a delta hedge and we go back up, that's the one that you take. "
"14195610","14197670"," Or you doubled out on that one."
"14200930","14202510"," That's a very good point, Chase."
"14202770","14203110"," Good job. "
"14204030","14205630"," Chase is a fucking man, dude."
"14206210","14208450"," Chase has turned into a professional fucking trader."
"14209810","14210790"," I've got to say that. "
"14213570","14215450"," Chase knows all the ins and outs too now."
"14219980","14221220"," Some fly right now."
"14222100","14226600"," But if you guys are not on this trade, look for a retest of this white line right here at"
"14226600","14227120"," home, okay?"
"14227620","14230860"," We're going to go back to the four hour here so we can get this thing done. "
"14231780","14233080"," So we know, right?"
"14233080","14237760"," We already know that we're coming into a, what is it called?"
"14238240","14239120"," A mopex, right?"
"14239520","14244360"," They like to bring price to where they want it from mopex."
"14245040","14251940"," If that's 400, it's usually a nice round number, 410, 415, 420."
"14254740","14256480"," I like to park that shit. "
"14256800","14258040"," Like we just park it right in there."
"14258540","14261600"," Is it markets free to do what it wants to do?"
"14263880","14269300"," Same thing happens on the end of month too, like the 30th or 28th or 31st, whatever it is."
"14269640","14270860"," There's like two trades in there. "
"14271040","14276160"," There's like the Thursday trade, Thursday, Friday trade, and then there's a trade for the 30th or"
"14276160","14276900"," 31st or whatever."
"14281960","14283420"," Hopefully you're flat right now."
"14287440","14289060"," So, okay, so spy, right?"
"14289280","14290480"," So this is a big one right here. "
"14290720","14292400"," The downside trade, right?"
"14294160","14296940"," This is the second part of the downside trade that I want you to know about."
"14297460","14299260"," So the big one is up here, right?"
"14299440","14300460"," And at home we should be doing this."
"14305450","14306250"," Right here. "
"14308110","14309350"," This is balance, right?"
"14311130","14312770"," This shit works like clockwork."
"14313850","14314710"," You buy the dip."
"14315530","14316430"," You sell the rip. "
"14316630","14317170"," You buy the dip."
"14317350","14317950"," You sell the rip."
"14318150","14318710"," You buy the dip. "
"14318950","14319850"," You sell the rip."
"14320730","14321570"," You buy the dip."
"14321710","14322210"," You sell the rip. "
"14323550","14325590"," So let's say I buy a dip down here, right?"
"14326450","14327810"," I put a stop down there."
"14328930","14330210"," No big deal if I lose."
"14330550","14334470"," If I lose one trade down here and a four or five, I'm a fucking rock star. "
"14335690","14337210"," I'm a fucking rock star."
"14338490","14340290"," If I meet, met you, right?"
"14340530","14344570"," And you told me eight of ten trades from me are baller."
"14344930","14347530"," And the other two that I lose, I get stopped out on. "
"14348230","14349130"," You're going to be rich."
"14350150","14350870"," You're going to be rich."
"14352890","14354090"," You're going to make a lot of money. "
"14357280","14358080"," Does that make sense?"
"14359620","14366600"," So the two times you were wrong here are one time or two times out of ten trades."
"14368960","14370440"," You're going to make a fuck ton of money."
"14371220","14372900"," You don't care about bears and bulls. "
"14374360","14375560"," That's just a heel, right?"
"14375680","14376900"," We use that term for heels."
"14377840","14379380"," That was like, oh, we make it a heel, right?"
"14379720","14383440"," We use bulls and bears as like a vehicle to like, oh, I'm super bearish here."
"14383540","14384240"," I'm super bullish here. "
"14384320","14385200"," I'm super bullish here."
"14385200","14385800"," Super bullish here."
"14386140","14386860"," Super bullish here. "
"14387000","14387820"," Super bullish here, right?"
"14394030","14397870"," So best dip buys down here for bulls, but we have some other things going on here."
"14399390","14401630"," We got this daily trigger right here, right?"
"14401830","14403230"," We already know about this daily trigger."
"14404210","14410130"," For this leg down here that you're looking for, this trade down here, you must close underneath. "
"14412210","14417650"," So even on smaller time frames, we have buy sell, buy sell, buy sell, buy sell, buy sell."
"14418010","14419190"," We get into higher time frames."
"14419350","14422230"," We got buy sell, buy sell, buy sell, buy sell, buy sell, buy sell, right?"
"14426790","14431370"," So you need to get underneath right now, today and this Friday, you need to get underneath. "
"14434350","14439250"," You have no, you have no bearish right here on a small, on a smart time frame."
"14439650","14441010"," This is by the fucking dip."
"14447480","14448740"," We already know it is. "
"14457580","14464010"," You sell this and you buy this, right?"
"14464010","14469870"," Who bought it, made money, sold it, sold it, didn't get my aspirin, bought it, right?"
"14470490","14474750"," Take the money and run, sell it, buy it, sell it."
"14475310","14475930"," You know what I'm saying?"
"14477830","14479450"," Pretty easy, not hard."
"14482330","14484090"," Let's say you wanted to sell this here. "
"14488060","14489180"," What are you waiting for?"
"14489360","14491060"," You're waiting to get underneath the daily trigger, right?"
"14491480","14492780"," Confirm the move under."
"14494360","14496980"," Execute the trade after the confirmation."
"14500420","14501680"," After the rejection. "
"14503580","14506580"," After the one last dip buy for copy down here."
"14508160","14509880"," None of that happened, did it?"
"14510500","14512040"," None of that happened, did it?"
"14513520","14518360"," It's a return to balance and the point of control."
"14520520","14524380"," Here it is right here at 4.1185, pivot point. "
"14531110","14533130"," So into next week, what are you doing?"
"14539840","14542100"," You're buying the fucking dip down here."
"14543360","14545460"," You're putting a stop underneath it."
"14551180","14555260"," If you're a bear down here, when do you put a short on?"
"14556140","14557340"," Under fucking need. "
"14565480","14566700"," I'm swearing now."
"14573950","14576190"," If you sell this today, right?"
"14576610","14579130"," And whoop, this dip got bought, what would you do?"
"14579890","14581290"," It stops up here."
"14582130","14585450"," You know we're likely going to go up here and try to tag this bullshit up here, right?"
"14586270","14587830"," And you re-short from right here. "
"14588130","14589610"," Now you can take the opposite side of the trade."
"14590130","14595610"," If you're short, the way paper explains that shit from Jenny Marcus, right?"
"14595610","14599590"," If you trade above the five or below the five, you can buy it and short, buy it and short,"
"14599750","14600790"," take both sides of the trade."
"14603250","14604690"," It's pretty simple here, right?"
"14605530","14606230"," What are we doing?"
"14606950","14608750"," We're buying the fucking dip down here. "
"14613180","14614860"," That's what we're doing into next week."
"14629770","14631330"," Now you savvy your traders."
"14634310","14636590"," So you buy this dip into the clothes right here, right?"
"14636910","14637430"," Boom, we go up. "
"14638050","14639810"," And they go, oh, cap, they're going to sell it into Monday."
"14639810","14640890"," That's okay."
"14641790","14643070"," Closer calls it the clothes. "
"14644610","14648450"," If you want to hold them into Monday, get on futures and short futures."
"14654120","14655540"," That's your chart for next week."
"14657600","14660260"," We have all kinds of gaps up here to close. "
"14662840","14666160"," We've got one more gap down here and a tiny one we missed down here."
"14667160","14670220"," So what's my expectation for into OPEX?"
"14674080","14676600"," 410 highest probability."
"14679800","14681900"," Next highest probability, 415. "
"14684580","14687660"," Next highest probability, 420, 400."
"14690280","14691100"," Here you go."
"14692160","14694200"," And what do I think the highest probability is?"
"14694460","14695220"," 4 fucking 10. "
"14697860","14700760"," And if we trade up here, we'll likely sell down into it."
"14700960","14703620"," If it's trade up here, we'll likely trade down into it."
"14706640","14707080"," Likely. "
"14708660","14710220"," You guys printing money out there?"
"14712700","14714540"," Did you guys get that one minute?"
"14714960","14715260"," Where's that?"
"14715260","14717120"," Oh, look at it right there."
"14718040","14721420"," Bull cross on the one minute chart."
"14723120","14724320"," Confirmation trade to the upside. "
"14724740","14728920"," One test, two test, cross upside."
"14730100","14731460"," Let's check the five minute."
"14734920","14740230"," Ooh, quick trade. "
"14742590","14744610"," First point of resistance, tagged it."
"14745490","14747090"," Second point of resistance, 410."
"14747590","14747870"," 58. "
"14748570","14754410"," Next point of resistance, 11.32. Big boy up there, 411.80. I don't know."
"14754570","14756070"," You're trying hard up here."
"14756290","14756790"," It's end of the day. "
"14756950","14758690"," We've got 20 minutes left."
"14759530","14761190"," I don't know, man, if you get up there on Friday."
"14762290","14762610"," You might. "
"14768510","14769910"," There's my thoughts on next week."
"14770790","14772170"," Now, after next week."
"14773190","14778050"," The vault pocket lips that's going to happen for the vault pocket lips. "
"14778150","14778810"," I'm going to tell you this."
"14779010","14780430"," These fucking institutions, right?"
"14780970","14785250"," They're going to park their shit and they're going to take their fucking money."
"14785550","14786210"," Mark my words. "
"14786290","14787250"," I'm going to swear at you right now."
"14787990","14789150"," They're going to take their money."
"14789370","14792710"," They don't care about your volatility apocalypse. "
"14793750","14795350"," If they can plan it, they will."
"14796350","14800190"," Now, if it's something unknown, yeah, they'll sell the hell out of this market."
"14802750","14805610"," But if they, but if they can plan it, they will get what I'm saying. "
"14805610","14806930"," Like they will plan all this out."
"14807010","14809130"," They'll take their money and they'll reposition for it."
"14809850","14814070"," And the dealers will take the opposite side of that train unless there's a waterfall of fear. "
"14815010","14818350"," So from now into OPEC's."
"14819350","14822010"," Unless an event happens that they don't know about."
"14824170","14826150"," Or that they find out before you. "
"14826150","14829450"," They're going to park this into mopex, okay?"
"14833210","14834410"," It's your job."
"14834730","14837030"," If you're a bear to hope for a couple things."
"14837670","14842830"," The best trade for a bear is to hope that there's no volatility that you don't see. "
"14843470","14845810"," Whether the banks don't or the banks find out about."
"14846350","14849410"," You kind of want like everything to be cool into mopex."
"14852170","14854970"," And be able to take that trade around then. "
"14855170","14856130"," Like see what they're trading."
"14856350","14856790"," Like what do you got?"
"14856990","14857150"," Like what?"
"14857470","14859750"," Because you know JPM puts a hedge on every single month."
"14859810","14860390"," The little ones. "
"14860770","14861150"," Not every quarter."
"14861290","14864250"," The quarterly is a big ones, but the smaller ones are by the month."
"14865010","14866290"," It actually watch the flows. "
"14866530","14867910"," People talking about the flows are coming in."
"14869890","14871530"," I'm saying kind of like get positioned."
"14874350","14876750"," If I was a bear, dude, that's what I'd be hoping for. "
"14876750","14880530"," I don't want to have to put a short on right now."
"14880770","14882930"," And we'd have trading up into opex."
"14883270","14885930"," And I'm burning a bunch of shit and missing trades along the way. "
"14887210","14888370"," That's what I'm hoping for."
"14888910","14892090"," Now if something happens that we don't know about the banks find out first."
"14892310","14892950"," Yeah, we start selling. "
"14893350","14895010"," It's still a low probability trade."
"14896110","14897090"," I'm here to make money, man."
"14897270","14899230"," I'm here to keep the lights on. "
"14900490","14901070"," Buy nice cars."
"14901750","14903150"," Take care of my kids and my wife."
"14903150","14906210"," And I'm here to make a living off of this. "
"14907090","14912450"," A lot different than someone trying to make like someone going to work and like taking that check"
"14912450","14914530"," and saying I'm going to let it all ride on black."
"14914770","14915210"," That's fine."
"14916730","14918010"," But that's not you and I."
"14918350","14920230"," That's not what you want to be as a trader. "
"14924920","14926600"," That's not what your goal is."
"14927100","14934720"," So for me, I think we pin into mopets unless something happens."
"14935240","14938340"," If you want to put that trade on now, the best way for you to put that trade on now"
"14938340","14940940"," is likely a ratio spread. "
"14942180","14946220"," It can handle like the bumps and the moves and it didn't go the way that I planned and that"
"14946220","14946640"," kind of stuff."
"14949040","14952100"," Now do I think we go to 430 is another big question."
"14952480","14953560"," That's a big question. "
"14954280","14960400"," Oh, there is a very good chance that we do."
"14962700","14967800"," There is a very good chance, man, that this volatility that we're all planning on does does not"
"14967800","14973240"," happen until mid to late June, possibly even July, maybe even September."
"14977180","14981720"," So do I think we go to 430 and I don't like the JPM caller like that's I know people"
"14981720","14982920"," like dismiss it. "
"14983260","14985360"," I don't like that it's at 4300."
"14986800","14989520"," You know, if the JPM top caller was at 4200."
"14990780","14991800"," We already tagged it. "
"14991860","14993840"," I'd be like, sweet, let's if we went over it a little bit."
"14993860","14995560"," I'd be like, let's sell the fuck out of this market."
"14996500","14998300"," That ship keeps me up at night time. "
"15004260","15004840"," Yeah, dude."
"15005100","15007540"," Yeah, Chase, like that shit keeps me up at night time."
"15007620","15012520"," I'm bull man, but if I was a bear, like I'd be like, why the fuck are they up there"
"15012520","15012960"," at that point?"
"15013100","15015780"," Like I get that they're trying to stop us from going above 4300. "
"15016200","15019700"," But you know, it's like a, it's like a, it's not a, it's not a magnet."
"15019980","15020800"," It becomes a magnet."
"15020800","15021760"," The close we get to it. "
"15022620","15025020"," Well, then we repel off it too at the same time."
"15025580","15028740"," Same thing on the downside, but like it's kind of, it's a magnet's there."
"15029060","15030500"," It's not a real magnet to get close. "
"15030500","15033300"," Then it nails it, but then you don't go any lower from it."
"15033740","15035140"," It's like this very complicated thing."
"15035280","15041680"," It's very complicated, but it's not here for this broadcast, but you know, just being up here. "
"15042240","15044760"," You know, like we're up here testing these four twenties and shit."
"15045120","15046560"," It's not easy to get to 430."
"15046760","15048560"," We all know it's not going to be easy to get to 430. "
"15051440","15053220"," There's some other things that bug me too."
"15057080","15059200"," It's like SPX man on a day chart."
"15059760","15060200"," Man. "
"15061260","15062440"," This bothers me."
"15065500","15067100"," The larger time frame here."
"15067580","15071580"," If you're a bear, I got to tell you, man, I believe in the sideways nut market, but you got"
"15071580","15072900"," to see it like I see it, right?"
"15073200","15073600"," Lower low. "
"15075480","15076200"," Tagged it."
"15076800","15077500"," Tagged it."
"15077940","15080060"," And we're, we, we kind of tagged it here. "
"15080580","15081900"," But you know how this goes, right?"
"15082400","15082420"," Slam."
"15082740","15085060"," They slam it up right here as an example of it."
"15088020","15090720"," In that 430 is just like medicine. "
"15091180","15091800"," It's right up here."
"15092380","15099980"," I don't know that we get there, but dude, if we did, like this is July right here, right?"
"15101460","15104660"," If we, if we ground up here, oh, that would, that would suck."
"15106520","15108180"," And there's one other thing. "
"15109160","15113220"," I posted a pattern that other people have been talking about."
"15116300","15118040"," It's not showing on SPX."
"15118220","15119120"," There's a lower low here. "
"15120840","15122280"," But on spy it is."
"15122380","15123520"," And I think on ES it is too."
"15125560","15132640"," It's close to being that pattern that you have to at least respect it to some extent. "
"15133320","15137480"," There's like a compressed volatility pattern."
"15137680","15138160"," It's very rare."
"15138280","15139080"," You don't see him that often. "
"15139080","15147880"," And the, this kind of stuff here compresses and compresses and compresses that it just rips face or"
"15147880","15148540"," melts up."
"15148560","15149880"," It's like a straight melt up."
"15151320","15154140"," That's the, that's the risk to bears at least. "
"15155520","15156600"," Those are the two risks."
"15156820","15159500"," The 4,300 and this pattern that's emerging."
"15161200","15162160"," And where VIX is. "
"15165800","15168700"," It's been there and this pattern has been emerging for some time."
"15169280","15172140"," Whenever I talk to you guys about like May and June of 2021."
"15173060","15174160"," It's that same pattern. "
"15175160","15176600"," It's that compressed volatility."
"15176900","15179660"," Whenever we talk, whenever we're talking to you guys, well, I can't want to see the VIX get back"
"15179660","15180920"," and they're like, it's not the November."
"15181180","15183020"," And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, look back on 2021. "
"15184520","15186000"," That is this playing out."
"15189300","15191140"," So now do I think we go down here?"
"15191360","15191920"," Fuck yeah, we do."
"15191920","15194080"," Whether it's now or it's at 430. "
"15195720","15197560"," Do I, do I think we go back down here?"
"15197660","15198020"," Hell yeah."
"15199420","15201300"," Is it in probably August, September?"
"15202460","15203820"," Probably more like this."
"15205080","15206660"," Best time, best time of this year. "
"15208100","15208880"," So here's September."
"15208880","15209080"," Remember."
"15215120","15217560"," And we do normally have one low in June two. "
"15217840","15218980"," So it's not like we can't go down."
"15219340","15220440"," But the gist is."
"15223380","15226360"," You know, some like that in June, I believe June and then. "
"15227660","15229120"," Or maybe that's not probably the best."
"15229300","15229840"," Some like this."
"15233040","15235660"," In a September, something like that. "
"15236620","15240400"," Forgive me for my, forgive me for my shitty lines."
"15241560","15243220"," I should just draw it like this."
"15244060","15245340"," It's something like that. "
"15245900","15247440"," Now there's going to be dips in there."
"15249520","15251200"," You know, it's something like that."
"15251960","15255180"," I know some of you are like, we're going to get this now because of the. "
"15256120","15258580"," And just do this bullshit or we're going to do this."
"15258580","15260040"," Both the bears like we're going down here."
"15260160","15261060"," We can do that. "
"15262480","15264120"," But you got to break some shit, right?"
"15264480","15265280"," You got to break that."
"15265620","15269560"," Like if you think we're going down there, you better get that confirmation that we're going down"
"15269560","15269780"," there."
"15271880","15274480"," Take a leg by leg or put a ratio spread on. "
"15274740","15276360"," A ratio spread on or take a leg by leg."
"15276880","15277920"," You only have two fucking choices."
"15278880","15282260"," If you think you can just go short and be like, I'm going to hope and pray for the best. "
"15282480","15283260"," You're going to have a bad day."
"15283640","15284240"," You're not Mike Barry."
"15284840","15285700"," You're going to get a phone call. "
"15285700","15286600"," I'm going to be like, fuck you."
"15286640","15287400"," We're taking all your money."

"15975760","15976760"," But I do go out in other ones."
"15977040","15977980"," I'll give you a pro tip. "
"15978720","15980820"," You show up, you tip the host."
"15981940","15984520"," And then you tip the server before you start eating."
"15985260","15986600"," Then say there's more coming to the server. "
"15988880","15994000"," And the last point would be you take the suggestions from the server."
"15994200","15995040"," Now that doesn't always work."
"15995200","15996260"," I've gotten fucked doing that. "
"15996600","15999540"," But the savvy servers, they're on it."
"16000560","16002320"," And this host will usually give you a good server."
"16003900","16005980"," If you tip the host, believe it or not. "
"16005980","16006340"," It sounds crazy."
"16006620","16007680"," Like why would I tip all these people?"
"16008160","16009960"," If you're a diner, you know what I'm talking about."
"16010360","16012420"," I'm not talking about like going to like Denny's. "
"16012560","16013520"," I'm talking about you go somewhere nice."
"16014160","16015120"," Take care of people."
"16017200","16018600"," You let them take care of you. "
"16018740","16021860"," You look like inject yourself and be like, well, I'm the boss now that I tipped."
"16022560","16023300"," Take care of me."
"16033470","16034470"," Your mom went to Vegas. "
"16034810","16035150"," Heck yeah."

"16040020","16043060"," Yeah, like Applebee's."
"16044460","16046220"," No, there's nothing wrong with Denny's."
"16046380","16047720"," I like Denny's and Wendy's. "
"16052820","16054660"," Don't be a professional diner though there."
"16055080","16056420"," They'll throw you at the front door."
"16059120","16061060"," Or don't be like what I was a kid. "
"16061220","16066220"," What you used to do is we'd like I'll take a tall glass of your finest water from the top."
"16067380","16071280"," And 30 sugar packets and a cut up lime, please, and a spoon."
