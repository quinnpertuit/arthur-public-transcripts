"53320","56740"," Just a second here."

"120470","122090"," Oh, it was up late last night. "

"148000","149180"," Oh, a second here."
"167250","168250"," So we're up this morning. "
"168590","176640"," We did get a bounce off of like 630 this morning."
"176920","177840"," I ended up taking last."
"178040","179080"," I was up late last night with. "
"181440","185400"," I was up late last night with a Joe Harper with a Joe Donut."
"187380","189560"," I'm like, shit, I need a short fucking market."
"190240","193420"," Well, that's short, but long puts on micros. "
"193660","198460"," All features turned positive in volatile trade after falling by over $1 a barrel earlier in the"
"198460","198720"," session."
"202040","209660"," And then close this morning."
"212430","214390"," Let me get this posted real quick for you. "
"215450","218410"," Of course, I'm dragging ass now."
"219950","222730"," We're going to go over FMC for tomorrow."
"222730","223670"," I'll bring up. "
"225470","230110"," At 10 a.m. Eastern time, we get USC be consumer confidence for January."
"230910","234430"," Four cars, one hundred nine on the prior one hundred eight spot three."
"234590","235130"," They're saying. "
"235410","238910"," So right now, we're going to take a look at what's happening in the market."
"240670","244890"," Talked about, I think it was four or two fifty four or two fifty two."
"244890","246410"," I'll make sure right now we'll take a look. "
"246410","251530"," So just so you guys can, I just want to go over what the rant that I was on yesterday."
"252270","254850"," I'm going to try to simplify this for you today."
"255510","258810"," Late last night, I was, well, that late. "
"259029","261850"," It was early last night, maybe 11, 12 o'clock."
"263270","265330"," And I had been going through."
"266410","270750"," I've been going through the spy options chain the past couple days. "
"272170","276170"," Last night, I went through it some more and then I wound up speaking with."
"276670","279570"," I went through SPX their options chain."
"280310","283190"," I went over the JPM caller yesterday. "
"284250","288050"," So I'm sitting there doing all this work after I had meetings yesterday, too."
"288250","290970"," Some of you guys here in stream are in meetings with me yesterday."
"292110","293830"," Now, we'll take a quick look right now. "
"293930","294590"," We're going to look at."
"296370","297410"," Hang tight here."
"298150","301650"," I put some new colors on this morning. "
"303050","308230"," So we're going to take a look at something you need to know this morning."
"308970","316490"," So we're going to look really closely here and you're just going to see the rejection here above in"
"316490","317010"," pre-market."
"317690","321230"," This is on spy and then we just got another rejection right there. "
"321670","324470"," It's roughly right around 40 right now."
"324510","326150"," It's at 4024 this morning."
"326270","327870"," It was at 40255. "
"328950","330390"," It's coming down a little bit here."
"330470","332950"," We want to see if we can have some continuation here."
"333010","333750"," It changes the colors. "
"334710","338650"," So we want to be above the white and above the red here."
"339390","341850"," We want to break above this yellow line right here."
"341950","344770"," We can get any kind of squeeze higher. "
"344770","352410"," And this is the trade that you're looking for for a fucking huge squeeze higher."
"353150","355670"," Just huge, ridiculous squeeze higher."
"357370","366610"," This would be something similar to what happened back here on the 25th of January. "
"367270","373910"," This is when we just straight melted straight up and we have daily, weekly and monthly velocity."
"374670","376150"," Screaming higher in the background."
"376850","379530"," So the closer we get to it, we're going to get a reaction. "
"379830","388330"," And the key here too is we want the one minute in the five minute to carry over above the"
"388330","391550"," hourly here to get that continuation."
"392090","395570"," Now we'll know here shortly if we're going to get the continuation or trade lower."
"395570","399110"," So far rejecting off here, but you know where you are. "
"399170","401110"," It's 40246 right now."
"401670","403290"," Pretty much that's what you're looking for."
"404110","406870"," You're looking for 40246 is. "
"410010","411290"," You know, right up here."
"411610","412410"," This is 40234."
"413330","415430"," This is kind of like the place right here. "
"415510","418650"," If we can get a move higher than just right here."
"418690","420630"," I don't care what book map says."
"420970","422590"," I get care less the book map says. "
"423670","428270"," If we squeeze higher than this yellow box right here, we're going to go on a run."
"429770","434290"," It'll be like by the hour, you like have a run for an hour, have a run for an hour."
"434290","436290"," We'll keep trying to make new highs on the half hour. "
"437450","439790"," And we'll see if we have continuation higher."
"439930","442970"," Now if we do get above this little yellow box right here."
"444090","447670"," I made a post this morning saying we could have new monthly highs on. "
"448390","450130"," On on on spy."
"450570","453070"," I think that's easy to be honest with you."
"453330","454530"," We might not get there. "
"454530","457130"," We'll know every half hour or every half hour of the hour."
"457130","461670"," We'll know if we're going to get all time, or all monthly time, new highs."
"462390","465870"," But it would not shock me to see us blast above here this morning. "
"466330","469710"," Or I should say if we get above here this morning."
"470530","471210"," It's on."
"471770","474210"," It's definitely on to end of day. "
"474310","475290"," Now this is in a month."
"475290","478330"," We don't normally see moves like this in a month."
"478810","481830"," I was thinking that we would pin to. "
"483450","488290"," 404 somewhere in here to get that 4060 and SPX."
"490490","493670"," So I don't know if we get this above, but I'm going to be watching it right now."
"494310","498470"," You know yesterday we took yesterday at the bell we took. "
"499770","501930"," I'm in the five minute right now on the wrong."
"503350","507230"," Yesterday at the bell we took calls right here for the open this morning."
"507430","508890"," You know what my take is on calls. "
"509670","513169"," If I'm down on them, I sell or I'm down on them."
"514230","516390"," I'll hold them if I if I'm up on them."
"516429","517429"," I sell them right on the bell. "
"517650","518549"," That's a rule that I have."
"519010","520289"," It's a directional move."
"520490","525110"," I want to make sure that I'm not missing out on the IV on a directional trade. "
"526270","527830"," So we'll pay attention to this here."
"527850","529250"," We're going to watch this closely."
"530170","533350"," Or you want to watch this closely for some continuation here. "
"533810","536750"," Still trading above the one minute figure here."
"537530","538710"," Bull still in charge."
"539470","543110"," If we begin to lose the blue line right here and come down below the green. "
"543610","545550"," Now we'll take a short into the end of the day."
"546270","549450"," But right now I want to see I want to pick this up here."
"549970","552030"," If we can get above this with price. "
"553670","556050"," This is a big move that's coming ahead here."
"556630","558630"," And explosive to be honest with you."
"558890","560530"," So we're going to see how this plays out briefly. "
"561470","569050"," We're going to tie this into FOMC because there's a there's a lot of stuff going on."
"569170","569290"," So."
"571070","573130"," First thing I want to talk about this morning is. "
"578690","582510"," First thing I want to talk with you when I get to bring up my thing here."
"583290","584330"," Good morning, by the way."
"584930","586250"," Hope you're all doing well out there. "
"598140","599760"," Show you what's going to happen this morning."
"600400","600840"," Now."
"603440","604540"," God damn it. "
"608380","609260"," Yesterday I tried."
"609520","614580"," I called my bank yesterday to wire a bunch of money over to be able to buy a fucking huge"
"614580","615480"," dip in the market."
"616880","619760"," And I thought it would have went through overnight, but it didn't. "
"623500","626880"," But we're going to talk about some important stuff."
"627560","629080"," This morning, first is."
"630040","631080"," I'm fascinated. "
"631620","632640"," Not quite like."
"633060","635440"," Don't really care how people think about."
"636080","638480"," The logic behind this, but I am fascinated. "
"639720","640420"," Cause I went down."
"640600","641980"," I went down a rabbit hole yesterday."
"643000","646140"," Finally, I've been doing it for a couple days and then I went down the deep rock. "
"646280","647100"," I'm like, you know what?"
"647100","648480"," I'm going to check every fucking option."
"651260","655100"," Chain out there from now into June on SPX and spy."
"657380","659060"," And I was, I was struck. "
"659580","660600"," I was shot."
"661340","663020"," I can't tell as of yet."
"665560","668880"," Well, the volume of puts on the market. "
"669660","670940"," Is outrageous."
"672080","676080"," Now I know that some of that is selling puts."
"677600","680140"," From large institutions and. "
"681920","684320"," Dealers take that trade for banks."
"684700","687280"," Okay, so if I'm a bank and I sell."
"687940","688820"," I don't know. "
"691780","693540"," A hundred million dollars."
"693620","694940"," If I saw a hundred million dollars and puts."
"695820","698260"," There's no one out there is going to pick up that trade in retail. "
"698680","701300"," So the dealers will actually pick that trade up for."
"702020","702980"," A bank."
"702980","707880"," So some of that stuff inside of the options complex on on SPX. "
"708000","709360"," I know that they buy and sell."
"710540","713220"," E S for the underlying shares of spy and stuff."
"715620","718800"," But I'm looking through that stuff past couple days and went down a rabbit hole on it. "
"720320","721320"," And like meanwhile."
"722720","724520"," Trying to get a handle on."
"726600","728340"," People's viewpoint on FOMC. "
"728840","730320"," And the impact of it."
"731120","732160"," It's kind of wild."
"732440","733540"," We might have to take a short here. "
"733860","737700"," So kind of wild because I want to hear so many different."
"738680","742220"," Opinions that it's fascinating because I've never heard this many opinions."
"743220","743520"," I've heard. "
"745120","746160"," I've heard people say."
"746860","750280"," If we get rate cuts will crash right."
"751280","752880"," I've heard if we get rate cuts. "
"754160","755000"," It's a new bull market."
"755020","755720"," We're just going up."
"756020","756640"," I've heard that too. "
"756640","759220"," And this is consistently across."
"760960","761920"," The market."
"763700","765820"," I've heard bears say both of these things. "
"765960","767300"," I've heard bulls say both of these things."
"767480","768480"," I've heard bulls bears say."
"769200","770760"," If we maintain course. "
"772180","773300"," Market will go down."
"773640","774000"," I've heard."
"774400","776600"," I've heard bears famous bears say. "
"777500","779740"," If we continue to cut rates the market doesn't go up."
"780100","780560"," Excuse me."
"780620","781760"," If we maintain raising rates. "
"782880","783860"," The market doesn't go up."
"784080","785320"," That's a fucking lie."
"785320","787260"," It's like a fucking lie. "
"787640","788420"," This is what it is."
"790780","791300"," So."
"793580","794620"," Let me see here. "
"795320","797280"," If I can show something really quick."
"799940","801380"," So I don't know."
"802140","805280"," I guess I feel or feel or think in my brain. "
"805540","806940"," My brain hurts from all of this."
"807620","814720"," My brain starts to hurt because I'm just left scratching my head."
"814720","816480"," This is an example. "
"816600","819540"," I guess you probably want me to back this up some way somehow."
"820680","822300"," This is just this one statement."
"824640","826620"," I'll show you just this one statement. "
"827860","828300"," So."
"830340","832380"," It just makes my brain hurt sometimes."
"833680","835820"," I'm left just scratching my head here. "
"836380","837880"," It's not just this one statement."
"838200","841640"," So this has to do with like does the fed pause does the fed."
"843600","845060"," Continue on with rate hikes. "
"846520","848160"," This is the fed funds rate right here."
"848440","849320"," We know what this is."
"850880","852920"," You can see right here the lead up. "
"853620","855800"," This is the lead up of raising rates right here."
"856300","857720"," The market actually went up for most of it."
"859060","868380"," Then we front ran the actual pausing or pausing or near end of raising rates. "
"868960","874300"," And then they've front ran right here that the actual anticipation of ending rate increases."
"875400","877860"," And then actually as rates came down we went up again."
"878640","880740"," And as we came to the bottom of rates we crashed again. "
"880880","881340"," You see what I'm saying."
"882400","884560"," So we can look at this one right here as well."
"885420","888220"," We actually raised rates here in the market went up. "
"888520","889060"," You see what I'm saying."
"890420","894860"," And as we pause rates we actually we actually just melted straight to the moon."
"894860","898180"," And then we pause rates of course we came back down. "
"898860","901520"," And so I just I guess I'm always left."
"903400","905260"," This is not the 1990s."
"905260","906000"," They got spy up. "
"906060","906920"," We can look at SPX."
"907420","908680"," But there's no fucking point."
"908860","909620"," I'll be honest with you. "
"909900","910300"," Right."
"911000","914320"," So this is just trying to prove the point that when someone says."
"915060","916260"," You know when rates are going up. "
"917060","918680"," The market doesn't go up."
"918800","920660"," I'm like that's just bullshit."
"921380","922640"," It's not just rates. "
"922940","925780"," It has to do with other complex."
"926080","928540"," Oh not complicated but has to do with inflation unemployment."
"929940","931040"," All kinds of other stuff. "
"931160","931620"," It's actually fact."
"931960","934500"," It's actually kind of fascinating to see where we are right now."
"935360","937900"," And we're where the spy is right now. "
"938560","940540"," And I had another conversation this morning."
"940700","943180"," I was I was awake quite early this morning."
"943760","945280"," Another conversation with Winky this morning. "
"945280","948140"," And I was like man I was like when I look back in history and I look at."
"949340","950620"," Economic conditions."
"951700","953040"," And the Fed. "
"955720","961400"," And in their interaction with stock market the stock market right we'll see."
"961520","963260"," Economic conditions the Fed."
"963980","964860"," And the stock market. "
"965520","968200"," This is probably the biggest fuck show."
"969500","971380"," That the Fed has created."
"972300","973600"," In its entire history. "
"974220","974880"," I'm trying."
"975360","977220"," I'm looking back on history with like."
"977580","978500"," Fed funds rate. "
"979160","980260"," Yield curve inverse."
"980720","983320"," The unemployment rate."
"983640","986660"," The inflation rate rate of inflation all this stuff. "
"986720","987080"," And I'm like."
"987480","989860"," And then I'm like comparing it to the cash market and I'm like."
"990320","992240"," This is part of the biggest fuck show we've had. "
"992500","993580"," And the scary part is."
"994140","995100"," If you start to overlay."
"996540","998900"," The hidden bear market that took place. "
"1001100","1002700"," That started actually right here."
"1002700","1006080"," It was actually a hidden bear market that took place."
"1006940","1008680"," Now way way way way way way back here. "
"1009340","1010300"," In 2020."
"1011080","1014880"," And when you look at this right here the S&P 500 doesn't quite show it."
"1015740","1018000"," But there are other indexes that do show. "
"1019820","1021400"," The bear or the."
"1022220","1024900"," The start of the decline of our market."
"1025300","1030480"," And so it's just wild when you compare all this stuff and then you see where the Fed is coming"
"1030480","1031619"," out with the minutes tomorrow. "
"1032500","1034680"," And where is Jay Powell and all of this right."
"1035359","1039540"," And they were expecting if you remember when we were up here they were you know we were talking"
"1039540","1039859"," about."
"1040560","1043220"," Inflation coming down unemployment rising. "
"1044319","1045560"," We were talking about."
"1046660","1048360"," No wage price viral."
"1049120","1049860"," We've had some of that. "
"1050360","1053680"," We were talking about the housing market crashing that hasn't happened."
"1054140","1059060"," We're talking about the car market crashing that stabilized a lot of the and so what we're doing is"
"1059060","1059240"," where."
"1059240","1065520"," Or my view is what we're doing is we're artificially artificially trying to manipulate. "
"1066840","1072240"," Our economy and the stock market when they're doing absolutely different fucking things than what"
"1072240","1074300"," they're what they're implied intent was to do."
"1075380","1078320"," On this market so just kind of wild to look at it all."
"1078700","1081740"," And then of course in the back end of it all it's very well to read. "
"1083980","1088060"," What bulls and bears say I mean bear bulls are same way right there they get the same you get"
"1088060","1089700"," two different viewpoints on."
"1090480","1096140"," The market going up so it's very muddy and I don't know if that's intentional is my point."
"1098640","1103800"," That it's muddied where it doesn't matter what the reason is we want to sell because. "
"1104300","1109380"," Of where we are with the month in my view the velocity that's underneath us I think that the Fed"
"1109380","1110700"," knows I think banks know that."
"1111340","1117260"," And you have to muddy the waters to make a reason to sell the market especially if your position"
"1117260","1118220"," short here."
"1118620","1122060"," And that's the key there was an article that came out yesterday the day before not the article"
"1122060","1126040"," about December hedge funds losing all this money but there was another article. "
"1126980","1131920"," Talking about the billions of dollars that was lost from three eighty to four ten."
"1132640","1136520"," There is a shit ton of money lost shorting the market at three eighty."
"1137360","1142880"," Of course we went up you know another fucking another two hundred and ten points or something which"
"1142880","1143840"," must have hurt right. "
"1145560","1149660"," Had to have hurt now the banks are usually right but sometimes they're wrong."
"1150280","1155320"," And when they are wrong it's bad right you can you can look back on history and find out when"
"1155320","1155940"," they've been wrong."
"1156560","1160360"," You can look up back many many many many many times in history and find out when they say. "
"1160800","1164880"," I don't I mean you can look at the bottom of every every fucking crash or ever had and."
"1165260","1169080"," Thanks come out and tell you we're not done yet right now I'm not saying we're not done yet going"
"1169080","1169640"," down now."
"1170480","1175420"," But I just want you to know that you know sometimes banks get banged up pretty bad. "
"1176100","1180420"," When they're when they're positioned a certain way so when I'm looking at this upcoming week."
"1181660","1185100"," And what's going on velocity if I was short this market."
"1186300","1191700"," And I can't we can't I think we got to the last night was the billions there's billions short this"
"1191700","1194240"," mark basically position shorter position long. "
"1194420","1197740"," And puts in this market for a rollover here in."
"1198440","1203140"," The next couple weeks the winking this one we're talking about the next CPI report."
"1203720","1207060"," We're talking about in FOMC. "
"1208100","1213680"," And how you know if you do get one more a third CPI with inflation coming down."
"1214520","1221900"," Do you only have two weeks to drop the market deep enough that you can on F yourself from a"
"1221900","1222420"," short position."
"1223520","1227980"," And you know how much how much get the lean on the market to stop it as well as part"
"1227980","1232400"," of the JPM caller to is to take volatility out of the market. "
"1233420","1236820"," So that we have a ceiling that we can go to in a bottom that we can go to right"
"1236820","1243500"," there's some there's some aspect to banks trying to lower believe it or not volatility."
"1243500","1250680"," In this market and upside and downside moves to something more rational now as all that's going on."
"1252820","1260560"," The fed in the banks have been attempting for over a year if not longer to sell this market. "
"1260560","1262400"," You know the longer that you sit here."
"1263540","1269600"," What happens is momentum comes up it's way way way way way way way way far away and down below"
"1269600","1269980"," us."
"1271300","1278520"," And over time that momentum continues higher right it starts to catch up and catch up and catch up"
"1278520","1279280"," and catch up. "
"1279580","1284300"," And you can kind of only sit in the pot without taking a shit for so long before it catches"
"1284300","1284940"," up to you."
"1285600","1287700"," And that's basically where we are right now."
"1288420","1296340"," It's basically we're at this point where it's been some time months years and in some cases on a"
"1296340","1296640"," monthly. "
"1297760","1298540"," Many years."
"1299840","1304120"," So we're kind of at that place where it's you know take a shit or get off the pot."
"1304700","1307300"," And so I'm fascinated right now to see where we are. "
"1308400","1312920"," Have a friend here that I talked to last night briefly I wasn't able to talk to him at length"
"1312920","1315100"," he had to hang out with his wife last night."
"1316100","1317420"," But he sees it as well."
"1318000","1319500"," And he's someone that I trust on this. "
"1320300","1322160"," So we're going to be paying attention closely."
"1323020","1324180"," I want to show you this this morning."
"1324820","1329660"," I showed to you a few moments ago but I want you to pay close attention to this. "
"1332800","1337360"," This is just on a one minute chart here I want you to pay close attention to this as we"
"1337360","1339040"," head into tomorrow's FOMC."
"1340600","1342700"," This is a daily momentum here."
"1343060","1346660"," This is a weekly momentum here and this is monthly momentum here. "
"1347440","1349600"," This has been coming up for almost 13 years."
"1349600","1356440"," I think this one is almost three years and this one I could be wrong on the exacts and these."
"1356680","1358600"," And then of course this one is yearly right here. "
"1360860","1365980"," And as all these all this momentum is coming up we're heading into the FOMC meeting tomorrow."
"1367540","1372060"," You really do need to we really need to not only trade under this."
"1372060","1378640"," If you're embarrassed we need to fit under this and we need to hold under this for that big plan"
"1378640","1385800"," to print all those billions short the market into CPI at least at least if it's down into CPI. "
"1386540","1392880"," If CPI comes out not hot right if that's three CPI reports right that are not hot."
"1392880","1398360"," So you like maybe you do your best to unfuck yourself or maybe they're expecting or going to"
"1398360","1403840"," manipulate a bad CPI report so they can actually print 360 or 3006."
"1404320","1408680"," This all started last night with a conversation with with Joe. "
"1410960","1416980"," Joe donut because of trying to punch holes in a theory here trying to punch holes and what happens"
"1416980","1419540"," when we interact with this kind of stuff."
"1424750","1426470"," It's very rare that we do."
"1428390","1433150"," Sometimes we have the blast down here right have another blast down here it only lasts a month. "
"1434230","1438650"," This one here was Tuesday March 10th."
"1439690","1446110"," We were back to the same price on Tuesday April 21st you're talking 30 days."
"1446770","1452930"," And I remember people you know that we have liquidation event here and if you had can you imagine"
"1452930","1457070"," having liquidated and 30 days later you would have been back to where you were. "
"1457650","1459530"," You just it just took a lot took it out."
"1461110","1470830"," Same thing back down here Wednesday December 19th and then Wednesday January 9th night you're"
"1470830","1471970"," talking three weeks right there."
"1471970","1477990"," Can you just imagine taking the L right there you'd be crushed if you took the L right there. "
"1479310","1480550"," Same thing back here."
"1482670","1487710"," 2016 actually came back retested again on the 16th or the 1st of February."
"1488570","1491810"," You know imagine you like we could reverse again you're like oh shit I'm out. "
"1493110","1495910"," You're like sorry."
"1498810","1499910"," Imagine you're like."
"1501270","1505630"," Imagine you're down here and you go fuck that I'm diamond hand and it comes back up and rejects me"
"1505630","1511530"," like fuck that we're going down here and you cut you cut yourself loose again here and you're"
"1511530","1514670"," fucked again right and they take it back same thing over here. "
"1515190","1518270"," You can kind of see how this happens again and again and again and again."
"1519950","1526950"," Same thing back here in 2011 not so much here not so much here in."
"1527890","1531230"," 2008 or 2000 but there's a significant difference here. "
"1532230","1536890"," And I want to show you the significant difference is that this blue line here is underneath this"
"1536890","1537610"," orange line."
"1538330","1542610"," We're actually in this part so if you look closely right here."
"1543110","1545450"," We're actually right here and not right here. "
"1546150","1548310"," Where this blue line is coming down and over us."
"1549050","1555110"," The act actually the the orange line has come underneath this at this point on our market."
"1555490","1557310"," So it looks more like this. "
"1557490","1561450"," This is both 2008 and 2010 sitting 2008 and 2000."
"1563450","1569170"," But at the same time you can see the orange line is below here where the orange line is actually"
"1569170","1572610"," coming underneath not above and so."
"1573470","1579890"," And so with this orange line underneath and not in the blue line not underneath this it lends"
"1579890","1581150"," itself to a bush. "
"1582950","1585230"," To a bush outcome believe it or not."
"1587670","1591650"," That we explode and melt up from here."
"1592410","1594690"," Now the market's not positioned for this. "
"1594690","1601630"," Now I keep seeing articles from all kinds of institutions and banks saying that it's it's."
"1602990","1607690"," Mobile buyers and new investors that are long here and that they shouldn't be."
"1608930","1614350"," I don't see anyone long here I see just banks short this market here. "
"1616630","1621890"," If I feel it or I feel that I'm thinking that this is like oh fuck we can't we can't"
"1621890","1623450"," have that melt up squeeze higher."
"1624030","1629670"," So we're going to tell investors not to be buying this when in fact they're going to get caught in"
"1629670","1629810"," this."
"1631010","1632690"," So I'm interested I'm fascinated. "
"1634150","1636130"," For two things to take place."
"1638690","1642150"," I'm fascinated for two things to take place coming into."
"1642970","1649370"," I'm fascinated for two things to take place basically FOMC and then I'm fascinating for CPI because"
"1649370","1656150"," underneath the surface of the stock market is telling a different story rather than what we're"
"1656150","1656710"," being told. "
"1658730","1663430"," And then under the surface story is that we're going to explode higher."
"1664290","1665630"," There's nothing stopping it."
"1666450","1669750"," Now if I was I guess if I was a short hedge fund or something or a short institution and"
"1669750","1673530"," have to or I didn't want this to happen or if I was the fed and didn't want this to"
"1673530","1673850"," happen. "
"1674590","1680610"," You'd have to get as bearish as possible and hope and pray that the positioning and the waterfall"
"1680610","1684230"," puts come in and the shorts come into the market knowing buys this market."
"1684750","1687450"," I guess that would be the hope and that sentiment doesn't change."
"1687490","1693810"," You really have to change sentiment as well to believe that we're going down here so that we don't"
"1693810","1694610"," squeeze higher. "
"1695750","1697270"," That's the only thing that I can come up with."
"1697330","1701050"," I'm trying to punch holes in this in this theory here."
"1701650","1707650"," Now how do you how do you how do you how do you how do you trade that would be"
"1707650","1708690"," the big question right. "
"1709450","1714910"," And the only thing that can say to you is that you're going to be expecting vol on FOMC you're"
"1714910","1719610"," going to be expecting vol into FMC not afterwards you're not going to expect it you expect all to"
"1719610","1719950"," come up."
"1720890","1726070"," But you're going to be looking for CPI FOMC to lead the way."
"1726530","1732190"," If we do trade below this momentum that's coming up into the market and it holds. "
"1733350","1736270"," I'm inclined here to join institutions."
"1737550","1744290"," I was looking yesterday I think this is some insane numbers like I was looking at spy I think spy"
"1744290","1746750"," 320 or 302 one of the other."
"1748730","1753210"," 34,000 puts for 80 cents tons of a premium on them. "
"1755450","1760170"," Tons and then I'm looking at a June spy I think or SPX."
"1761730","1765650"," Like I think it was a kid you not it was like 250 P's."
"1766050","1770070"," So I'll look at them this morning with you and try to show you where all this. "
"1770890","1774970"," All these people are positioned but there is some major money put in that we're not even talking"
"1774970","1776070"," about SPX yet."
"1776970","1780230"," A hundred million dollar trades against the market on SPX."
"1780610","1785930"," I know some of this is dealers taking hedging trades on the market. "
"1789390","1795630"," But I think I'm trying here I'm trying I'm trying to find and I like under normal circumstances if"
"1795630","1800190"," you're out there using Elliott wave or you're out there using fucking triangles or whatever the"
"1800190","1801090"," fucking is you're using."
"1802390","1807070"," Gamma levels options positioning I'm full I'm on board."
"1807970","1816470"," I'm on board a hundred percent but right now just this confluence of this stuff is making me pause"
"1816470","1817130"," the market. "
"1817630","1821790"," I think we stick my head up to be like what's going on here we're going to get some going"
"1821790","1822910"," to happen we don't see coming."
"1827200","1830100"," You know I was looking I was looking below last night on."
"1830420","1833000"," So I'm running I'm running all these spreads last night. "
"1833760","1835980"," If we actually do go down to 320."
"1837600","1843680"," By March 31st it's like a six dollar trade for like six hundred five or six hundred dollars or"
"1843680","1844320"," something insane."
"1845140","1849620"," Like 10 10 grand pays like some of ungodly amount of money. "
"1850980","1853280"," Of course you have to stay in that trade until you hit."
"1853280","1857920"," You can't you probably won't be able to execute get unfucking yourself out of that trade but the"
"1857920","1860840"," payoff is just stupid just ridiculous."
"1863600","1869200"," So just wondering like how do we get to what so that that was the last part I had a"
"1869200","1872480"," conversation with Jill last night and I was like what's the last part of this conversation. "
"1873000","1880300"," I'm like the last part of this conversation is how do you justify a move down."
"1882300","1888040"," If I was if I had five billion dollars riding against this market what money would I have to spend"
"1888040","1892920"," to get us to drop eight hundred two thousand points by March 31st."
"1892920","1895300"," I'm like I have to create some shit for sure. "
"1896300","1901580"," So I don't know if it's just muddying what the general public is thinking."
"1903040","1909060"," The market can go down if we pause rates or if we stay on rates or if we increase we"
"1909060","1911760"," do have 50 point rate hike."
"1912520","1916920"," I mean you muddy it enough that people eat whatever that you fucking tell them. "
"1916920","1917500"," Right."
"1918000","1922680"," They'll consume or they'll just start shaking their heads up and down like sheep and say yeah"
"1922680","1926060"," that's that sounds right because we've been talking about it or at least half the people have been"
"1926060","1928440"," talking about it for this amount of time."
"1929460","1931020"," Starting to squeeze now. "
"1932340","1933300"," On the spy."
"1935940","1936880"," Right on up."
"1937640","1943840"," You want to be careful of the SPX pin for the JPM caller for today. "
"1946960","1952460"," We have in the past traded above the SPX pin on SPX dollars."
"1953000","1962280"," They don't make any more money on that trade but we have gone above in the past."
"1962560","1964960"," So just be aware that that's not guaranteed to be top. "
"1967120","1967600"," Right."
"1967820","1971740"," 40 to 40 we have another 12 cents to go here."
"1973200","1977880"," Well actually just I think it's 42 46 or something we'll take a look right I'll take a look right"
"1977880","1978420"," now and see. "
"1981630","1982790"," We're on it right now."
"1984830","1988950"," It's a 42 or 40 239."
"1990330","1994730"," So this this should either be top right here or we're going to get a huge squeeze right here. "
"1995550","1997110"," In a second here I'm going to take a trade."
"1998930","2000510"," We're going to get an explosive move up."
"2000690","2001110"," We break through. "
"2023860","2024260"," So."
"2025780","2027380"," We hold this for you right here."
"2029020","2031460"," That's 10 20 you get about 10 more minutes for a nice. "
"2032800","2034280"," Last higher right here."
"2036080","2038880"," That big giant green ball right there a bunch of buyers."
"2040400","2041480"," Panic out the disco. "
"2045160","2047400"," I'll show it to you right now on."
"2048179","2051760"," I'm going to show it to you right now here to see you can see it."
"2054199","2054900"," Excuse me. "
"2056520","2058120"," We're going to see what happens here."
"2060739","2063100"," I'm going to get a nice nice squeeze higher here."
"2063260","2065719"," So we'll see we'll see if we can have some continuation here. "
"2077909","2081250"," Hopefully we can get a I'm going to get this blue line up here."
"2082090","2082949"," Let me see if I can."
"2084770","2087570"," Hopefully right here we'll get this nice little blue line right here. "
"2088070","2094310"," That one right there."
"2096150","2099570"," I'm going to look for this one minute to come up and I'm waiting for this five minutes to come"
"2099570","2099690"," up."
"2102850","2106690"," I'm looking at four oh two's again and four oh three's. "
"2113130","2114850"," We'll see if we can get a nice squeeze here."
"2120390","2121570"," All right, I'm in."
"2124170","2125370"," We'll see what happens here. "
"2126310","2127350"," We're going to squeeze a reversal."
"2128470","2129390"," You know where to put your stops."
"2129690","2130610"," You know where to put your ads. "
"2134460","2138500"," We're going to take a look back on previous previous highs."
"2139060","2140480"," Yeah, we probably target that."
"2140860","2142400"," We target our one or even higher. "
"2143360","2145440"," Maybe four oh five twelve above there."
"2147080","2151760"," First I got ones like four oh three seventy two and then we're going to have another target of four"
"2151760","2153580"," oh five and some change above."
"2157780","2158760"," If this holds. "
"2163820","2165140"," Might need to come back down."
"2165280","2167540"," Get some support in the green arrow or the green line right here."
"2172700","2176700"," Whoopsie whoopsie daisy. "
"2182160","2185840"," Yeah, we'll take a look at Tesla's got an explosive move coming as well."
"2186480","2187720"," Someone just asked about Tesla."
"2189100","2190580"," We'll take a look at Tesla too. "
"2190680","2192940"," Tesla's got kind of a wild thing going on with it as well."
"2194480","2200000"," Tesla would be served very well to Tesla's above it's one minute."
"2200220","2202160"," It's above it's five minutes above it's hourly. "
"2203240","2209660"," It should it should stay on track now to go back and start retesting some of the previous eyes and"
"2209660","2210760"," try to make its way to 196."
"2212260","2215060"," I'll show you Tesla real quick if you want to see it."
"2220600","2222700"," Tesla's at a fascinating place as well. "
"2224260","2227480"," You can see that I'll show you right here."
"2229940","2235400"," You can see when Tesla came back down tested it's hourly trigger the one and five minute reacted"
"2235400","2239920"," with the daily started to raid rampage right."
"2240700","2246080"," Came back down tested it's hourly slipped underneath and then regained it's hourly. "
"2247000","2251800"," So the neat part that I find the fascinating part that I find about Tesla right now is that the"
"2251800","2256620"," daily keeps raging higher on Tesla."
"2256980","2260700"," So I had a top here at 196."
"2260980","2262420"," It's coming down every day. "
"2263040","2270320"," It's now at 193.78. But it isn't me fascinating to see if this daily sometimes you'll see some kind"
"2270320","2274760"," of a move like this down and then up and then down and then an explosion higher."
"2275440","2282300"," This is a lot of this is going to depend upon what happens FOMC and CPI if we get this"
"2282300","2287080"," volatility squeeze higher or if we get the volatility squeeze and go lower."
"2287260","2294720"," I would not be caught dead near until after FOMC and CPAs this orange. "
"2295440","2302200"," See if I can do a better job of doing this with you or visualizing this as this starts to"
"2302200","2303540"," come down here over time."
"2305660","2308800"," And this blue line comes down here over time."
"2310540","2315060"," And this white line comes above here I don't know if I got a white here maybe. "
"2315500","2317100"," All right we'll just pretend this is white."
"2317860","2321400"," As this comes up you're going to see a massive break above or below."
"2322220","2326440"," This would be a really good I'll be honest with you really good if you can find them cheap. "
"2329200","2334020"," Find a find a cheap OTM call and OTM put."
"2335660","2337820"," Like a strangle on on Tesla."
"2338620","2340920"," This is going to be kind of a fascinating trade to watch. "
"2342240","2347340"," I look tried to look at a set up yesterday and even as we were selling off into that belly"
"2347340","2349620"," yesterday I could not find cheap fucking calls."
"2350200","2356240"," It's a really hard Tesla is the kind of a trade where maybe you just wait until it breaks above"
"2356240","2357940"," or wait until it breaks below."
"2358580","2361640"," Because like strangles on Tesla kind of fucking suck. "
"2363080","2364900"," Bulls don't care they buy calls."
"2365380","2367020"," I don't know why it's the most traded."
"2367300","2370880"," Not that I don't know why it's the most traded stock in our market. "
"2371540","2375600"," So there's always premium built in for there's always like a sucker out there."
"2375600","2381200"," If I was a dealer it'd be my favorite favorite ticker because I'll always find a buyer for calls"
"2381200","2383300"," and I can always take their money away from them."
"2383500","2388780"," No matter what like if it goes up I got the premium if it goes down I got the premium. "
"2389740","2395600"," There's always like a Tesla call buyer they don't care they should care but they don't so if you're"
"2395600","2396920"," going to buy a Tesla call."
"2398340","2404480"," Maybe it's after it makes a break higher or put until it breaks lower and that just happens to"
"2404480","2405180"," bears all the time."
"2405300","2406340"," You ask a bear that shorts Tesla. "
"2407040","2410020"," You can get fucked up shortened Tesla just the same right."
"2411040","2416340"," So you might want to just be waiting to see if it breaks up higher or if it breaks lower."
"2425820","2428020"," Yeah do you guys I'll do XRT next. "
"2428860","2430020"," I'll look it up right now."
"2430600","2434320"," Do you want to look at the tickers we looked at yesterday."
"2435880","2438940"," I don't remember exactly we looked at yesterday we can take a look at. "
"2441660","2442740"," Recently we did."
"2444820","2445980"," What did we do yesterday."
"2447140","2449000"," We didn't do any of these here yesterday anyway. "
"2449940","2450860"," We look at CVS."
"2454600","2456540"," I didn't do CVS here did I."
"2458200","2459740"," That's still going up isn't it Winky."
"2461000","2463640"," I have CVS I did in a different chart. "
"2464160","2466220"," Oh yeah."
"2466500","2467100"," Peacore baby."
"2468720","2469160"," Peacore. "
"2469720","2472720"," I was wondering I don't think peacore is done I think it goes to 63."
"2475060","2478620"," That's where this chart is not showing that the tickers that we did yesterday."
"2479920","2487140"," I'm having some problems with with Webull because I'm signed into it on one chart not signed into"
"2487140","2487980"," it on another chart. "
"2490320","2493120"," Let me take a look and see we charted yesterday hold on."
"2495480","2497040"," Oh I did here's XRT."
"2497520","2498400"," You want to see XRT. "
"2505400","2506800"," It's trading above it's one minute."
"2508260","2510580"," Training above it's monthly it's very bullish right now."
"2511580","2515980"," If you want to know it's extremely bullish right now we can start it out if you want. "
"2520570","2522870"," And see here XRT."
"2526000","2527780"," Yeah it's extremely bullish right now."
"2531060","2532020"," It's a beautiful chart. "
"2532900","2534160"," I mean do I have to say anything else about it."
"2535960","2536980"," Probably not right."
"2538320","2539400"," Extremely bullish right now. "
"2549220","2551120"," It's above it's weekly above it's daily."
"2553880","2559980"," Above it's monthly accumulated like a monster in here."
"2562720","2564580"," It's been accumulated quite well. "
"2566680","2569060"," That was the biggest block of sellers right here."
"2569420","2588310"," Probably going to get didn't get"
"2588310","2589850"," some resistance here for sure."
"2630890","2631750"," Let me see here. "
"2631990","2634450"," Sorry I'm trying to get some stuff in the background going on."
"2642260","2643740"," More buyers right here."
"2646900","2649120"," That'd be where you want to rebuy right here. "

"2690360","2691600"," And just second here. "
"2696600","2699120"," Oh yeah baby I'm making money."
"2700340","2702700"," Make me some money."

"2728560","2729660"," We'll do snap again."
"2734680","2736560"," Slap that ass. "
"2738900","2740080"," Slap that ass."
"2744980","2747260"," Slap it for me."
"2754660","2756800"," Yeah I took profit and added some more. "
"2759220","2761080"," I took profit on half."
"2761700","2764080"," I traded after the bell."
"2764740","2767780"," Carried some into this morning to profit and it's more. "
"2768780","2772760"," Now I'm on 403s but I just took profit on them."
"2772760","2774760"," So I'm going to look to re-enter here in just a moment."
"2776480","2778340"," Oh baby you guys want to see it. "
"2778420","2779880"," We want us to go back and check it out."
"2780720","2781920"," What do you want to jump in on this?"
"2783100","2784780"," You wanted confirmation first."
"2785060","2785600"," Is that what you wanted?"
"2787240","2788160"," Is that what you wanted?"
"2790530","2791390"," Okay you ready?"
"2792030","2793110"," Here we go. "
"2794970","2796170"," Alright we got the spy here."
"2797230","2799730"," The spy has no broken above its hourly trigger."
"2799950","2801730"," That makes it three trigger cluster. "
"2801730","2808350"," And if you fasten your seat belts here you're going to be looking for the one minute and five"
"2808350","2812570"," minute velocity to come up and rapid sass around the one hour velocity."
"2812970","2820090"," So as we can tell if we look at the spy real quick on the one minute chart you have"
"2820090","2820990"," this going on at home."
"2823890","2825690"," Yes, yes, yes, yes. "
"2825950","2828570"," This is when we start to squeeze higher."
"2831870","2835710"," And you can see we're now above the one hour velocity trigger you're going to see the one minute"
"2835710","2838450"," and we're going to blast off for about an hour here."
"2839010","2840430"," So strap in boys and girls. "
"2841990","2843250"," We're going to go burr."
"2843390","2846750"," Now you do know that above we've got some places to take a look at."
"2846750","2850730"," We've got our one above at 403.72. That would be PT one. "
"2851890","2856490"," And then we've got PT two above here get that number one."
"2856850","2861170"," And then we're going to go and look back to yesterday."
"2862850","2865430"," There's PT number one we got I mean we got a couple places here to be. "
"2865910","2872850"," We got like get some bears and be like oh you know we all kinds of highs over yesterday we"
"2872850","2873890"," got volatility cap."
"2874490","2876710"," And we're like okay we got that one right there."
"2877290","2880030"," We'll show these up for the oh we get the Hendrix line too. "
"2880750","2881830"," We're going to do the Hendrix line."
"2881910","2883470"," This is the one this is the bad boy up here."
"2884330","2886490"," We'll do the Hendrix line higher. "
"2887550","2888490"," That's been right there."
"2889710","2892850"," This is every swing and dick that was this is the Hendrix line right here."
"2894590","2895610"," We'll make that one dotted. "
"2898350","2901850"," And these are all bears that are short into FOMC right."
"2903090","2903990"," Something like that."
"2907270","2908670"," We've got that boy right here. "
"2908910","2909830"," This is the Hendrix line."
"2912170","2914370"," And we'll do the big old green right there."
"2915110","2916930"," And we'll do the text right here. "
"2917830","2919550"," We'll do the H line."

"2929240","2930580"," There we go right there."
"2932000","2932880"," There's our one."
"2933720","2937740"," A bunch of little shit over here but remember. "
"2940850","2941710"," The rules."
"2944960","2945620"," Squeeze higher."
"2947280","2949280"," Come back down one minute line. "
"2949740","2954360"," Got a new high right now you want to come back down retest this one minute line."
"2954840","2957760"," We want to get a new high right could be right here actually."
"2958920","2960880"," We want to get a new high on this one right here. "
"2960880","2963940"," So I'm going to be looking to hopefully you guys don't just leave me behind here."
"2964600","2966120"," I can grab another one of these trades."
"2966920","2967200"," Okay. "
"2967740","2969120"," I thought we were a bloodbath today."
"2970560","2975840"," Something about twin sisters or twins or something like that."
"2976000","2976820"," I hear that somewhere. "
"2977060","2978040"," Let me listen to my airpiece here."
"2979260","2981540"," I thought we were going down on day three."
"2982520","2983420"," I thought that was happening. "
"2984180","2984780"," Wait a minute."
"2985200","2989040"," I was told the third day of going down was cancelled."
"2990160","2991300"," On the end of the month. "
"2991460","2993840"," I apologize for any of you bears out there."
"2995140","2997060"," Because I do remember yesterday."
"3002640","3004420"," I do remember yesterday. "
"3010640","3011220"," Tesla."
"3011220","3011640"," Wow."
"3018040","3018860"," Okay. "
"3020120","3028760"," Oh boy."
"3029120","3030200"," Our stock market."
"3030520","3030780"," It's amazing. "
"3030780","3031500"," Isn't it?"
"3033250","3034310"," It was amazing."
"3034710","3034890"," Isn't it?"
"3039380","3041710"," Plan B or Plan Z."
"3041710","3044870"," Go back on Fintuit and say I closed yesterday."
"3045390","3046390"," Delete all texts. "
"3047250","3048750"," But I'm super short."
"3054670","3055650"," Yeah, I know."
"3056130","3058030"," I bet everybody closed their shorts yesterday, right?"
"3058590","3059010"," I bet they did. "
"3063610","3064930"," I bet they did."
"3068670","3069770"," Oh shit."
"3076010","3076450"," Okay. "
"3077010","3078650"," If they didn't, they're gonna today."
"3089970","3090850"," Oh boy."
"3091070","3093230"," And we're starting to squeeze once again this morning. "
"3094450","3095790"," Welcome to the S&P 500."
"3096750","3098990"," How long has it been since we've had times like this?"
"3099290","3099730"," Do you guys remember?"
"3099990","3102970"," Do you guys ever remember a time in the S&P 500 the past year?"
"3102970","3109150"," 13 months where we haven't had any follow through and going up."
"3110410","3112070"," Just look familiar to you. "
"3117190","3117930"," I know."
"3118370","3119290"," Well, that's my point."
"3120490","3123810"," My point is that this whole year where it was right, right?"
"3124630","3126510"," We had continuation, right?"
"3127570","3128170"," That's my point. "
"3131270","3134370"," We would get the twin sisters and it never failed."
"3134590","3134770"," Did it?"
"3135470","3137230"," Well, but recently it has been failing."
"3137570","3139490"," And so that's my, that's where my, my ears are up. "
"3140190","3142590"," My, my little prairie dog ears are going."
"3142910","3144510"," Why are we not getting follow through?"
"3146070","3147750"," Why are we not getting follow through?"
"3148830","3149850"," So that's the key."
"3151270","3154550"," Key is why we're not getting follow through because we've gotten follow through all year. "
"3155010","3157470"," Like literally or not all this year, but all 2022."
"3158630","3160670"," Work like magic, right?"
"3161170","3162270"," So I guess that's my question."
"3163230","3167130"," Is my question is why is it not working now?"
"3168770","3170150"," So I just need an answer for that. "
"3170730","3171830"," Yeah, turn around Tuesday."
"3172030","3172770"," No, that's not the reason."
"3173510","3174590"," It's not the reason. "
"3176250","3177330"," You got to think bigger."
"3178470","3179650"," It works all year."
"3180570","3181310"," Twelve straight months. "
"3182190","3184450"," I want to know why it's not working right now."
"3185130","3187730"," I need a factual based answer to that."
"3187850","3188670"," And I'm not getting it. "
"3188870","3191550"," I'm getting a lot of, I'm getting a lot of like, oh, I have no idea."
"3192430","3194270"," Or it's this reason or it's that reason."
"3194270","3197610"," And I'm like, yeah, well, that should have worked the rest of the year too. "
"3197610","3198250"," And it didn't."
"3200900","3202600"," We'd fucking roll and we'd roll hard."
"3202660","3203280"," It was over. "
"3204560","3207020"," You know, you look back on here."
"3207100","3207680"," I'll show you this."
"3207700","3210280"," So I posted something on Finto ASM now. "
"3210440","3211680"," And this isn't like proving anything."
"3212380","3213260"," It's just saying."
"3213920","3217560"," It's a question that I want to answer that no one seems to be able to answer for me. "
"3218460","3220360"," You can't seem to get an answer on this."
"3221720","3223260"," And because it's unusual."
"3225660","3230760"," People tell you that they didn't, people tell you that they didn't get caught in this. "
"3230960","3232200"," But I'm going to show you where people got caught."
"3232780","3236260"," As a matter of fact, I didn't take a long in this when it first happened."
"3236260","3237740"," So I'm going to show you something really cool here. "
"3240140","3241680"," So I'm going to show you something cool."
"3241900","3242860"," So I have some rules, right?"
"3242860","3247100"," I trade with rules and I take a, I take an oversold trade."
"3248420","3250700"," I remember I think it took seven of them this year. "
"3250960","3251720"," This is our 2022."
"3251740","3252860"," It took seven of them."
"3255360","3257860"," And I'm going to tell you exactly where I missed the trade this year. "
"3258060","3259180"," I'll show you a place I missed the trade."
"3260100","3260340"," So."
"3262700","3263860"," You know, we came up here. "
"3263960","3265040"," We sold it all down, right?"
"3265320","3267500"," I was like, whoo, you can find me on Twitter."
"3267700","3268940"," I'm like, buy this bottom right here."
"3270740","3272280"," And people told me I was crazy. "
"3272620","3273400"," And I was like, nope."
"3273780","3275640"," I was like, we're super oversold right here."
"3275820","3277700"," Like, I don't care if we come back down. "
"3277700","3278480"," I don't care what happens."
"3279260","3280360"," Like, we're super oversold."
"3280600","3284500"," Bought this, printed it, came back down, but we went right back up again, right?"
"3284700","3285220"," Super oversold. "
"3285480","3286380"," No way we're not going up."
"3287020","3287720"," Absolutely not."
"3288300","3289720"," No one left to sell to. "
"3290340","3292300"," Now, I missed this trade right here."
"3294080","3295380"," We came down here."
"3298200","3299500"," Because we're in a bear market. "
"3299500","3302260"," I was like, that's not quite oversold."
"3303840","3305620"," Pretend you don't see this over here right now."
"3308570","3310810"," Let me see if I can just black it out for a minute. "
"3312790","3313530"," Oh, fuck it."
"3313730","3314430"," This isn't here."
"3315130","3317450"," When we were in here, we first came in here. "
"3317690","3318350"," I got really scared."
"3318990","3322350"," I think Boba Yaga and I are both scared."
"3322610","3324670"," Both of us, I think, were like, oh, shit. "
"3324870","3327290"," We have a real chance of having a market crash here."
"3328070","3329610"," I was petrified."
"3329610","3332090"," There was some weekly moving averages coming up here. "
"3332230","3332760"," It's some nonsense."
"3333530","3334650"," And it looked hella sketchy."
"3335690","3338090"," And so I didn't put my long trade on. "
"3338310","3346030"," And the other key point here is, price did not follow the breath coming down."
"3348370","3352690"," Instead, while we were in here, like a few days later, I was talking to people in Fintuit."
"3352830","3359290"," And I'm like, man, I'm like, breath is starting to come up as price trades sideways. "
"3360930","3363970"," And so I remember this moment right here in Fintuit."
"3364170","3366750"," People were like, oh, dude, we're going to fucking bloodbath tomorrow."
"3366750","3368570"," And I'm like, I don't fucking think so. "
"3368910","3372090"," They're buying this shit under the surface and they're not telling anybody."
"3372550","3373150"," This isn't retail."
"3373730","3376210"," This is fucking banks buying this shit underneath the surface. "
"3377210","3384270"," And of course, I hadn't put a spread on here because price hadn't followed a market breath going"
"3384270","3384590"," down."
"3385450","3388290"," And that's what I noticed yesterday."
"3388290","3391090"," And said, man, I was like, breath's coming down pretty good. "
"3392050","3394830"," I was like, my price hasn't followed with that breath yet."
"3395230","3398390"," So, so far, this isn't like guaranteed or nothing."
"3398550","3403150"," But so far, I'm not seeing price follow breath down. "
"3403650","3412790"," This is, look, this here is looking more like this so far than this over here."
"3413310","3413970"," Does that make sense?"
"3415270","3416910"," Hopefully that makes sense to you."
"3417590","3422830"," So that means that we're getting rotation, selling something and buying something else. "
"3423090","3426570"," I'm not selling something and not buying something else and saying cash in the background."
"3427330","3429550"," Now, that doesn't prove anything here where we are."
"3430470","3433310"," But it does, it does, you know, perks up your ears. "
"3433550","3439350"," One more data point that you're asking yourself, man, this doesn't look like what people are saying"
"3439350","3439750"," it is."
"3439910","3441950"," Doesn't look like what a bank is saying it is."
"3446880","3448720"," So that's my question. "
"3448720","3450320"," These are my questions that I'm having."
"3450420","3451960"," Do I care if we go up or down here?"
"3452060","3454540"," No, but I don't care if we go up another 300 points."
"3455020","3457420"," I don't care if we trade sideways from here. "
"3457620","3459320"," I don't care if we go, if we bloodbath it here."
"3459920","3462700"," I get one last leg like Mike Wilson says."
"3464000","3468320"," What I do care about is once we do make that break, if it's the break above or the break"
"3468320","3471780"," below, then I know why it's happening. "
"3472120","3476540"," I know that if we break below that momentum, then I know we've structurally broken the stock"
"3476540","3476860"," market."
"3476860","3482420"," If we are able to blast off from that momentum, I know why it's happening."
"3482700","3488640"," So I'm not sitting on social media or at home with my buddies in an office somewhere and saying, I"
"3488640","3490080"," have no fucking idea where we're going up. "
"3490980","3497520"," In my effects, last night, I went and looked at some blog posts just before we made the move from"
"3497520","3498300"," 380 it up."
"3498440","3500300"," And I was going through some blog posts."
"3500480","3505180"," I get emails of blogs from people and people didn't think we were going up to 410. "
"3505180","3506260"," And I mean nobody."
"3506540","3509000"," And they didn't understand why we went up to 410 either."
"3509180","3516100"," So they're not watching the mechanics underneath the market as to why we went up. "
"3517320","3519500"," And then it gets explained later why we went up."
"3520620","3523620"," But I guess at the time I'm trying to figure out before it happens."
"3523960","3528880"," So when I talk to you guys, I'm not talking to you after the fact, trying to talk to you"
"3528880","3531480"," before the fact and say, this is what I think's going to happen. "
"3531920","3534000"," And these are the reasons why I think it's going to happen."
"3534740","3536720"," And why we're blasting off right now."
"3537660","3540520"," To four or two to a new high four or two ninety nine. "
"3542740","3543500"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3560690","3562910"," Let that ask one more time up there."
"3564090","3565570"," Just slap it around."
"3572380","3573360"," Yes, I did. "
"3581300","3583460"," All right, this is that melt up."
"3585860","3587240"," This is that lightning, right?"
"3587380","3590560"," We touched that electric fence and we're eight."
"3590700","3591720"," We're too close to it. "
"3594460","3595260"," Go on here."
"3595920","3596160"," Like."
"3600560","3601440"," Hot, baby. "
"3601660","3601780"," Hot."
"3602780","3604940"," I was up with two Harvard last night to what?"
"3605200","3605820"," Twelve thirty at night."
"3607540","3610300"," Twelve thirty at fucking night going down the rabbit hole. "
"3610560","3612040"," And then I'm like, I'll be back in the morning."
"3612380","3613020"," Then I shorted."
"3613100","3613500"," I shorted. "
"3613640","3614700"," Well, I had."
"3616560","3617620"," I did it."
"3617840","3618100"," So Joe. "
"3618280","3620600"," I went on and I bought some fucking."
"3621600","3623600"," Some M.E.S. minis."
"3624140","3628740"," In the middle of the fucking night until like fucking four AM. "
"3632800","3633520"," Close that."
"3633520","3633800"," Oh."
"3634940","3635920"," Four of three. "
"3637760","3638780"," Four of three."
"3640140","3640500"," What?"
"3642880","3643240"," No."
"3650880","3652420"," Oh, no, it was the micros, too. "
"3652540","3653300"," It wasn't even the mini."
"3653420","3654300"," It was the micros, bro."
"3655740","3658380"," It was the micros after we talked about the micros. "
"3658460","3659600"," I'm like, I want to do the micros."
"3668620","3668980"," Whoa."
"3672190","3672650"," Whoa. "
"3674050","3676150"," Four of three is now trading a dollar seven."
"3679190","3681990"," Dude, I fucking traded them for the first time last night."
"3682110","3683090"," They're fucking baller. "
"3688450","3691050"," They were they were they were straight up baller."
"3691650","3692990"," I got to be honest with you."
"3704320","3706240"," The micros are kick ass. "
"3712140","3713300"," Oh, baby."
"3714300","3715640"," Get on up there."
"3715820","3717100"," I thought we were burning this morning. "
"3718360","3720040"," I thought we were burning this morning."
"3721260","3722280"," That's what I was told."
"3725370","3726930"," I was told to be cake at this party. "
"3739400","3740840"," Yeah, I haven't slept."
"3741120","3741460"," I haven't."
"3741560","3744040"," I've probably slept like three hours last night total. "
"3745000","3747320"," I got a got a little bit of sleep in this morning."
"3749200","3751940"," And I'm like, I fucking hate PJ traders."
"3752200","3753900"," This is why I don't trade fucking futures. "
"3754600","3755400"," I don't hedge futures."
"3755400","3756620"," I'm like, this is bullshit."
"3758860","3762320"," I just if I was a if I was like a full time. "
"3762540","3764800"," I was a full time fucking futures trainer."
"3764800","3765480"," That would be it."
"3767040","3768840"," I don't even think my family would know me. "
"3768940","3772520"," I would just be like, I just you just see me roaming around the house every now and a while."
"3772700","3773420"," Every once in a while."
"3774320","3777800"," Like the most disgusting gambling habit you can have. "
"3778260","3780160"," No offense to any of you guys that trade futures."
"3786540","3788040"," Okay, we're going to do another one."
"3788780","3789680"," We got a new high. "
"3792100","3794160"," Snap another wine, baby."
"3803380","3805380"," No follow through the bears again."
"3806240","3806860"," I wonder why. "
"3808040","3808500"," Trend intact."
"3809160","3809380"," Got it."
"3810300","3812580"," Check trending up still. "
"3817320","3818020"," Got it."
"3819440","3820480"," Trend intact."
"3820800","3821780"," Do you guys remember yesterday?"
"3822060","3824020"," And I was like, Oh, please Lord Jesus. "
"3824220","3824800"," Just hit."
"3825200","3827200"," I was like, just hit three nights."
"3827400","3827640"," What was that?"
"3827900","3828640"," Hit 393. "
"3828660","3829920"," Please just touch it."
"3830420","3831200"," I double dog."
"3831440","3831640"," Darya. "
"3832100","3833060"," Just tap it."
"3833240","3834540"," I double double dog."
"3834860","3835000"," Darya. "
"3835360","3836940"," Now trading 403 17."
"3840820","3841180"," Yes."
"3841380","3844580"," He was like, just come down here and hit that green box for me. "
"3844700","3844880"," Please."
"3845640","3846520"," I'm begging you."
"3847340","3848380"," I'm begging you. "
"3848500","3848820"," I want to know."
"3849000","3850300"," What dare you to sell this market."
"3850460","3851320"," I dare you. "
"3851820","3854060"," Now trading 403 27."
"3856980","3858920"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"3860840","3861960"," Give it to me. "
"3868180","3870340"," It's just it's just a scratch."
"3870400","3871000"," I promise."
"3871000","3873080"," It's just a scratch. "
"3878160","3879280"," Tis but a scratch."
"3884260","3885460"," So terrible."
"3886580","3906590"," Oh, that"
"3906590","3907450"," must have hurt, huh?"
"3908430","3908950"," 434. "
"3911110","3912230"," Man, that hurt."
"3913930","3915230"," You got bears that pair."
"3915230","3916230"," This is where the bears are. "
"3916370","3916850"," They're right up here."
"3918250","3918890"," They're right here."
"3918970","3919590"," This is the H line. "
"3922080","3923180"," This is where they are right here."
"3924760","3926460"," We got like, we're angry."
"3928800","3929180"," Errr. "
"3931040","3931420"," Errr."
"3933540","3934320"," Look up there."
"3938560","3939100"," All right. "
"3939200","3940000"," Let's see what happens here."
"3940640","3941740"," We have a quick reversal bar."
"3941920","3942240"," Tweezer. "
"3942880","3944680"," This is sometimes called a tweezer reversal."
"3945320","3946560"," We'll see the third candle still red."
"3946820","3948520"," Probably going to look lower for some support down here. "
"3949000","3950880"," Let's see if we can grab one more in the five minute."
"3952780","3954900"," A little bit of momentum to kick up on us."
"3959360","3960080"," Oh, man. "
"3960360","3960880"," Killing me."
"3968260","3972260"," Oh, man."
"3984770","3985570"," Too funny. "
"3986610","3988550"," Thought we broke trend there for a minute."
"3989010","3990050"," No, I didn't."
"3991050","3993370"," I didn't think we broke trend because we hadn't. "
"3993750","3996850"," Looks like that flat line did just fine, didn't it?"
"3999420","4002260"," Looks like that flat line looks intact to me."
"4003320","4004400"," There's that flat line."
"4005560","4009160"," Looks like that flat line thing he hasn't fucking proved wrong has it so far. "
"4010220","4011340"," Just keeps doing its thing."
"4012660","4014840"," Here comes the rage above right here."
"4022180","4023260"," It's coming for you. "
"4023960","4026620"," It's just underneath the surface like this little shark down here."
"4028840","4030480"," Kind of weird looking shark, isn't it?"
"4031840","4032620"," Get teeth."
"4033380","4033960"," Get some weird eyes. "
"4037720","4038680"," All right."
"4040560","4044940"," Let's get some support on the five minutes down below the screen line right here."
"4044940","4051300"," I think this line should be higher, but we're right about there. "
"4052420","4053600"," We're interacting with the one minute."
"4053880","4058180"," I do want to see there was a pretty firm rejection here on this new high."
"4058340","4062060"," So I'm going to look down below, see if we can grab some support down here for one more trade"
"4062060","4062300"," higher. "
"4063420","4064920"," See if we can take out this R1."
"4067280","4072520"," I think we still have time to at least get up here to the age line this afternoon."
"4072520","4076380"," I'd really like to see this 405.13 at minimum. "
"4077180","4081160"," We'll take a look at SPX real quick and see where we are in SPX."
"4087650","4088350"," We're close."
"4088970","4090750"," SPX at 4038. "
"4090990","4091750"," We have some more space."
"4092070","4092750"," We can move up higher."
"4095710","4099490"," That would put us for a six would put us. "
"4102550","4103670"," I think right at the gap."
"4103670","4106529"," I think that puts us right at the gap."
"4108990","4111729"," It puts us right at 127 at 4pm. "
"4112710","4113550"," We'll take a look at that."
"4125060","4126020"," Right here."
"4127080","4127840"," I'm going to have that right. "
"4129880","4131200"," 127 at 4pm."
"4132540","4134920"," See if we can actually close that gap above."
"4135160","4135520"," It's right. "
"4137020","4141939"," This is where the gap is and this is also where the collar is."
"4145310","4148590"," So we'll see if we can come out and take this out by end of day."
"4149529","4150670"," That was my pause it was. "
"4151370","4152250"," We might be able to get."
"4155710","4157569"," Might be able to being end of month."
"4158450","4160770"," You trade this up, squeeze up higher here. "
"4160770","4165229"," I don't know if we get the new high on the month of January."
"4165550","4168970"," Maybe it's a it's a far shot to get that."
"4169870","4174149"," But this is the gap above and this is also where the this is where the JPM collar is. "
"4174290","4174710"," Just so you know."
"4175950","4177109"," My SPX at least."
"4178170","4178890"," JPM collar. "
"4179029","4179689"," They don't always hit it."
"4179790","4180029"," Perfect."
"4180390","4181149"," Sometimes they go above. "
"4181350","4182649"," Sometimes they fail to get it."
"4182950","4184609"," They get pretty fucking close though recently."
"4185850","4186649"," For end of month. "
"4187370","4189850"," We'll see how that plays itself out for the rest of today."
"4191590","4194430"," We'll put this down here for you so you can see where it is."
"4197090","4199050"," There is the collar right there. "
"4202390","4203250"," Right here."
"4205810","4208050"," We'll keep an eye on this as the day progresses."
"4209490","4212250"," And some of you know the rules on this stuff. "
"4212390","4213730"," I can see you in chat talking."
"4214330","4217870"," We're coming in at 10.56. We're going to see if we get some continuation higher here."
"4219370","4220190"," It's good job. "
"4220410","4222170"," Some of you out there that are paying attention to the rules."
"4222870","4224790"," Appreciate that you pay attention to learn on your own."
"4255620","4257560"," Can explain the JPM collar. "
"4258060","4258320"," Okay."
"4261240","4264600"," JPM has a hedge equity fund called eight."
"4267140","4270900"," It's got like $20 billion in assets. "
"4272640","4274980"," It holds stocks in the SP 500."
"4276160","4277880"," And SPX options."
"4279200","4281220"," That's why I'm watching SPX this morning. "
"4285340","4286140"," Hold on a second here."
"4286240","4286300"," My."
"4287500","4293490"," Oh, fuck it. "
"4300170","4300770"," The."
"4301110","4302850"," The implication is that the."
"4303390","4304670"," That the collar will. "
"4305930","4310010"," If we're in a volatile market tends to lessen the volatility."
"4310350","4310610"," So."
"4312850","4315750"," The lessons of volatility within the market. "
"4315770","4317930"," So there's like all kinds of banks little hedge market."
"4317930","4319190"," They try to."
"4319250","4323450"," They try to lessen believe it or to lessen the volatility and give. "
"4324370","4325390"," Consistent returns."
"4325670","4328230"," So it's manipulation in the market basically to say."
"4329330","4332210"," I've got a fund with a pension fund right. "
"4333510","4336290"," And I want the pension fund to make consistent returns."
"4337370","4338750"," Year over year over year."
"4339450","4341190"," I don't want to give my pension fund. "
"4343070","4346930"," Huge returns one year and low returns the next year right."
"4346930","4348490"," It's just try to make it."
"4351170","4351690"," Consistent. "
"4353250","4355490"," Right so that I can go to let's say."
"4356710","4357670"," I don't know."
"4358210","4362750"," I'd say teachers unions like well we need consistent returns every year of 7%. "
"4362750","4364710"," You're like well this fund over here."
"4365350","4366590"," The last 20 years."
"4367210","4371450"," As provided a 7% return consistently we had one bad year. "
"4372290","4373870"," Outside of that's been very very good."
"4374550","4375330"," Makes sense."
"4380130","4385230"," How the caller is the caller is you sell OTM calls. "
"4386930","4389810"," Can you buy a put vertical spread."
"4391850","4398450"," The premium that's made off of the calls is used to pay for the cost of the put spreads."
"4403870","4404610"," Does that make sense. "
"4404950","4406190"," So right now they're getting paid."
"4407830","4410730"," For us to the closer we get to four zero six zero."
"4412810","4415550"," And now they have a free put protection. "
"4417190","4419550"," Regardless if we go up or down."
"4420130","4421870"," They actually don't care at this point."
"4422530","4424050"," If we go up or down. "
"4427670","4431390"," They don't care where we go because they have free puts."
"4431770","4435150"," It's a it's a free hedge against the market going down."
"4435290","4437430"," So let's say the market continues higher at this point. "
"4438190","4438970"," They don't care."
"4439850","4440890"," Does that make sense."
"4441450","4442750"," Now the market goes down. "
"4443370","4444410"," From this point."
"4445550","4446930"," They collect the."
"4448030","4450550"," The gains from the market going down. "
"4450550","4455970"," And their fund doesn't feel that impact."
"4459390","4460430"," Does that make sense."
"4461850","4464610"," Does everybody following this the idea of this. "
"4465610","4467590"," So does it mean that we go down here."
"4467890","4468130"," No."
"4468970","4471050"," But it means that they have a free hedge. "
"4471770","4474370"," You guys can actually figure this out easily."
"4474830","4479290"," Let's say you are an easy way for you to to synthetically trade this in a much."
"4479510","4480790"," Much more simple way. "
"4481630","4482070"," Let's say."
"4483670","4485870"," Let's say you buy a call."
"4486370","4486670"," Sorry. "
"4489730","4494990"," We're trying to figure out a spread like what you can do on a spread is if your spread hits"
"4494990","4497010"," 100% and let's see about one month spread."
"4498190","4499350"," And it goes up."
"4500730","4502910"," One month spread and it goes to the moon. "
"4503710","4504470"," In three days."
"4506150","4508930"," You can monetize one side of that spread right."
"4510250","4514670"," Take the money and put it in the pocket and you don't close out. "
"4515690","4516850"," The short side."
"4519150","4520470"," You just hold it."
"4522390","4524510"," Into expiry and why do you do that. "
"4524950","4525470"," Well because."
"4526290","4532150"," You've been paid the max amount on the long side of a long or a long call spread right."
"4532990","4534550"," This is the basic idea of it is. "
"4535030","4536870"," You now you now pocketed."
"4537810","4542190"," The long side of that trade right and you're like whoo made all the money that I can make on"
"4542190","4542570"," that trade."
"4543150","4544670"," There's no way for me to make any more money. "
"4545010","4550170"," Now if I just pocket these free puts or these free sold calls over here in my pocket."
"4551030","4552270"," And if we go down here."
"4552670","4552970"," Fuck it. "
"4553090","4553850"," I'm going to get paid double."
"4554170","4554970"," I'm going to get paid again."
"4555490","4555930"," To make sense. "
"4556770","4558030"," I'm trying to simplify this for you."
"4559430","4560750"," Now if we continue higher."
"4561170","4561570"," What do I care. "
"4562010","4563910"," I wasn't going to make any more in that in that spread."
"4564570","4568170"," It's just protection against something really ugly happening in the market."
"4568590","4570430"," There's no reason for me to close those out. "
"4571810","4572650"," Does that make sense."
"4577190","4577410"," Oh."
"4581110","4585750"," You guys understand this concept now is that a basic understanding of what the collar is. "
"4585930","4588070"," Now there are better ways to hedge the market."
"4588650","4591430"," But you know JPM is like an old school bank."
"4591710","4592510"," They're like fuck this. "
"4592650","4595450"," This has worked for us for I don't know how many years and this is what we run."
"4596010","4598170"," Now the other problem with this is that."
"4599130","4600690"," Everyone follows that trade. "
"4601590","4607270"," And not only does everybody follow that trade but because they're holding those puts down below or"
"4607270","4609590"," those sold calls down it's basically puts."
"4611550","4613430"," They're holding a put spread down below."
"4614330","4615290"," It's like a magnet. "
"4616430","4618290"," Now we don't always go down to that magnet."
"4618510","4620150"," Sometimes the magnet's down at 3060."
"4620590","4621730"," Sometimes it's 3600. "
"4622870","4627590"," Now if you get a bunch of smaller funds and family offices and you get retailers."
"4628190","4629050"," They're like oh baby."
"4630370","4632430"," JPM wants us going to 3600. "
"4632710","4635630"," They're going to load the fuck up on them that on that trade to follow it."
"4636890","4641050"," And so you get this like it's not waterfall effect but you get like a."
"4641950","4643690"," Like an amplification of."
"4643690","4645430"," Of that trade. "
"4647150","4651730"," Like you'll get people that are like oh man JPM tolerance today or it doesn't end today but."
"4653050","4654570"," We hit the we hit the number."
"4654990","4656170"," Let's start selling it. "
"4658270","4660530"," And there's some argument that."
"4661310","4664490"," The market is also pinned in this range."
"4665990","4668610"," Not always but sometimes it's pinned. "
"4668910","4670610"," There's an argument that's made that it is."
"4671390","4673850"," That it can impact our trading range."
"4674250","4677590"," For that for that time period that that's not always true. "
"4678210","4680190"," I can make September."
"4680730","4682810"," September of 2021."
"4684890","4686470"," We we fucking blasted. "
"4687790","4690850"," I remember exactly what the caller was in September."
"4691530","4695090"," Sorry it'd be like September 30th the 31st of 2021."
"4695370","4696530"," We fucking went straight up. "
"4697470","4699350"," We went straight up into December right."
"4699570","4700050"," We ended up."
"4700430","4702210"," I think we dipped and then we went straight up. "
"4702910","4705270"," We melted straight up into December 31st."
"4714980","4715580"," That's right."
"4715780","4717900"," They do it for their cash protection ETFs. "
"4718500","4718940"," Absolutely."
"4722170","4723350"," Yeah it doesn't always work."
"4723510","4724250"," It doesn't always work. "
"4725830","4728530"," It's not it's not easy to trade to."
"4729470","4731570"," Usually people be like oh this is our range."
"4732890","4735430"," This is what we're trading but we don't always trade that range. "
"4735430","4736710"," Sometimes we trade out of that range."
"4737150","4737890"," Prime example."
"4738330","4741570"," September 31st 2021 2022. "
"4742550","4744210"," We straight melted up the entire way."
"4744870","4745710"," We never looked back."
"4751620","4756300"," So that's I was asking that question yesterday and then I was talking to Joe about this yesterday. "
"4756580","4757360"," I said to Joe."
"4758820","4762960"," Oh last night I had said to Joe I said look I said I don't know do I."
"4764080","4765240"," I was like do I just."
"4765880","4770240"," I'm assuming that what I do here is I'm going to look for a bottom to buy. "
"4771680","4775000"," This is the last Mike Wilson saying this is the last leg."
"4775540","4776600"," Of the bear market."
"4776960","4778980"," I'm like okay sit on my hands. "
"4778980","4779940"," I don't do anything."
"4780600","4782060"," I look for a bottom to buy right."
"4782780","4783840"," Called my bank yesterday. "
"4784540","4786680"," Said start sending some fucking money over right."
"4786780","4787280"," That's what I did yesterday."
"4787280","4787960"," I want some money. "
"4788900","4792160"," Because I'm like you can't just start moving money."
"4792160","4796000"," I don't know if you know this or not but maybe your bank allows you to but you start moving"
"4796000","4798620"," like big money and your bank is like fuck no."
"4799100","4802160"," Is this you have to come down to the office and that kind of stupid shit. "
"4804680","4807500"," They want a reason."
"4808140","4808960"," What do you need this money for?"
"4809140","4809480"," Where's it going?"
"4810080","4810240"," Literally."
"4814780","4817760"," That's my positive is I don't care if we go up here. "
"4817760","4819600"," I don't care if we go to the side here."
"4819600","4820940"," I don't care if we go down here."
"4821760","4826280"," We're probably getting the last leg of the bear market for one to three years. "
"4826360","4828620"," That's my positive until I'm proven wrong."
"4829060","4830000"," I'm sticking with that."
"4832060","4839100"," I don't care about price care about we're kind of at the tail end of all the bullshit we have"
"4839100","4839440"," to be. "
"4839880","4843740"," There's no way you're going to be sitting here and tell them we had a silent silent market crash"
"4843740","4845580"," started in December 2020."
"4846640","4849020"," We're going to crash the market in 2021."
"4850120","4852960"," Even though it wasn't seen on the large indexes. "
"4854160","4859160"," You're not going to tell me that we're going to crash the majors in 2022."
"4860320","4863040"," You can actually see in."
"4865320","4868500"," In the Dow Jones that they said fuck this we're going up. "
"4869160","4870380"," We've had enough of this shit."
"4870980","4873280"," You can see that all 0.222 right?"
"4873600","4874380"," Almost at all time highs."
"4874800","4876760"," The idea was like fuck this we're done. "
"4877380","4878520"," We've been through the cleaners."
"4882220","4885080"," So that's the point is how many years can you do this."
"4886060","4887660"," The gig is up at some point. "
"4888800","4893020"," And they're going to front run the selling and they're going to front run the buying."
"4893740","4896020"," We know that we know they're going to they're going to front run the shit."
"4896660","4899140"," The bad shit and they're going to front run the good shit. "
"4899860","4902080"," You want to front run that before you ever get in."
"4902940","4904740"," Always if they can they will."
"4905920","4907820"," So at this point I think. "
"4908360","4912200"," I think the bearish stance that I had I had a bearish stance where I was like I'm fucking."
"4912560","4913820"," I'm a bear man."
"4914040","4916680"," I don't care how long it takes one, two, three years, whatever it takes. "
"4917220","4920880"," Like I started getting bearish in 2020 like in 2020 I was bearish."
"4921780","4924080"," I was like I was like I was I was bearish then."
"4926000","4928820"," Well I wasn't bearish and everything but I was bearish a bunch of shit. "
"4929360","4932220"," Like individual takers and shit I was like fuck that I'm out."
"4932900","4937300"," So I have to start changing my viewpoint being like I'm a bull."
"4937620","4941320"," So I'm like yeah I've started thinking about some specific things. "
"4941720","4945760"," I've started thinking about the end of the bear market."
"4946900","4951100"," I don't think that it's the end of the bear market for a long period of time."
"4951200","4952300"," I think it's one, three years. "
"4953060","4957660"," I don't think we've seen a bottom like a like a bear market bottom yet."
"4957660","4960100"," I think we see that down the road."
"4960760","4962060"," But we have major problems. "
"4962280","4963580"," The fed has fucked this shit up."
"4963760","4966420"," Like they have ruined not ruined but this might be the worst."
"4968140","4970260"," This might be the worst bed we've ever had. "
"4970860","4972900"," I never thought I could think that."
"4973220","4974180"," I thought this was a good bed."
"4975240","4976780"," But this fed has fucked it up so bad. "
"4977140","4978080"," It's a it's a disaster."
"4978420","4980260"," It's an utter incomplete disaster."
"4981760","4984540"," It's done no good service to anyone. "
"4986280","4986720"," Nobody."
"4988000","4989600"," The timing is all wrong."
"4990000","4991320"," The economy is all wrong. "
"4991600","4992380"," What they're trying to do."
"4993020","4994320"," It's a it's a complete disaster."
"4994740","4997960"," I've tried to look back in history when it was something like this and. "
"4998280","5000100"," It's like a it's like man bear pig."
"5000300","5003700"," It's like you got like a little bit of the 50s a little bit of the 70s."
"5004020","5008680"," You got a little bit of still you've got money sloshing around everywhere. "
"5008740","5009180"," Right?"
"5009440","5009580"," Still."
"5010380","5013960"," You've got claims of QT when it was all bullshit to begin with."
"5013960","5017500"," You know Jenny Marcus this past Jenny Marcus. "
"5018520","5019500"," When was this?"
"5020020","5027760"," This was in spring I think made a post where he showed or he posted a link to the fed"
"5027760","5035140"," so you could go in and look at the mechanics of QT when it was going to start."
"5035140","5038160"," And I remember the commercial back security guys."
"5038340","5040420"," They're not on been to it but they're on Twitter. "
"5040980","5045340"," But the commercial back security guys were laughing their asses off."
"5045620","5048520"," They were like there's no fucking way they're doing QT with us."
"5050360","5053740"," Or commercial commercial back mortgages or some shit like that. "
"5053780","5054300"," What the fuck it's called?"
"5054900","5055340"," CMB."
"5055500","5056680"," CMBs or something like that."
"5056960","5059500"," These guys are like there's no fucking way they're doing QT. "
"5059500","5064520"," We'd have a collapse of the financial monetary system in the North America."
"5064540","5066320"," The free world would have a collapse."
"5066620","5069500"," And sure enough they didn't do QT on that shit. "
"5070800","5077720"," And then Jenny Marcus this is like late early summer late late spring posted a link to the fed in"
"5077720","5079780"," their QT operations in the treasury."
"5080580","5082020"," And if you read if you read it."
"5082720","5087120"," If you just read it and read it and read it and read it and read it until you understood"
"5087120","5088020"," what they were saying. "
"5088860","5094740"," They're basically they're basically saying this like okay."
"5095420","5098360"," We're going to remove this money from the market right."
"5098720","5100500"," I'm trying to make this simple for you. "
"5102620","5105580"," And we're going to look for people to show up."
"5106260","5108400"," And buy this by this dog shit."
"5109320","5114000"," At an auction and if they say no or if nobody shows up don't worry about it. "
"5114000","5119760"," We're going to put into a warehouse but we're going to account for it as if it's been taken out."
"5121640","5125540"," So on a piece of paper it says that this shit's all gone but it's not."
"5125820","5126240"," It's just warehouse. "
"5126760","5128260"," It's kind of like the debt ceiling."
"5129440","5132220"," We just put it to the side and say yeah yeah."
"5133240","5134260"," Don't worry about the debt. "
"5135500","5136240"," We dealt with it."
"5136760","5137960"," But you do really haven't."
"5138660","5139100"," Right. "
"5139320","5140240"," So it's still kind of there."
"5140820","5143080"," Even though in the books it says it's gone."
"5143820","5146380"," So Treasury Department's been lying the entire time. "
"5146920","5150100"," They have to because they'll crash the crash our system."
"5151040","5154500"," So then you've got QT though for the little guy out there."
"5155320","5160340"," And this is when they're not going to hurt businesses which is what we think we're told the feds"
"5160340","5161760"," like yeah we're going to do this and we'll do that. "
"5162120","5162800"," Businesses don't care."
"5163400","5165000"," Businesses go through their own business cycles."
"5166660","5168240"," Regardless of what the fed does. "
"5168740","5173120"," But then you've got trying to hurt the little man but not really hurting them enough which is a"
"5173120","5173480"," problem."
"5174140","5178380"," And then we start to look like the 50s and 60s right where everybody's got a job."
"5179720","5184740"," But yet the business cycles haven't come to that point where they're going to start to close right"
"5184740","5186520"," where they're going to hit bankruptcy yet. "
"5186820","5192120"," So you have all these like normal economic cycles normal fed cycles normal market cycles."
"5192860","5197040"," And meanwhile you've got the fed just trying to manipulate it all at the same time."
"5197640","5202740"," And it's not really working is it kind of like a kind of like a car with the wrong gas"
"5202740","5204160"," in it wrong oil it. "
"5205480","5208300"," It missed it missed a regularly scheduled."
"5210920","5215260"," Maintenance it has some maintenance that's not due for another two or three years right."
"5215740","5219300"," You're like yeah I got to change that time belt in your boss like I want you to change it"
"5219300","5222000"," right now and you're like I fucking changing that for another three years. "
"5223020","5223920"," Does that make sense."
"5225140","5229600"," So meanwhile you're forced into changing your timing belts and they find out your water pump is"
"5229600","5234400"," gone you can't fix the water pump but you got your water pumps all fucked up and your belt is"
"5234400","5234920"," changed though."
"5235440","5240040"," So you know you're running down the road and your vehicle and it's fucking clunking from the bad"
"5240040","5241920"," gas get fucked up boiling it. "
"5242340","5245000"," Your water pump's not working but belt is fucking brand new."
"5245500","5246700"," You just like what am I doing here."
"5248040","5251080"," And meanwhile you get the stock market that's like what are we doing. "
"5251820","5252860"," We just sit here."
"5253660","5257040"," I got to watch on I mean what you know you just torched."
"5257780","5260220"," You just torch these companies for two years. "
"5260740","5263720"," You're telling me we're going to torch them for a third year and you don't even know."
"5264700","5267000"," If it's going to take another year to three years."
"5267660","5268980"," Why don't you do your work over there. "
"5269540","5272820"," We'll make a market and make some money and we'll come back to you in three years."
"5273000","5273580"," Does that make sense."
"5274300","5275620"," That's the kind of how I'm looking at it. "
"5276380","5279840"," Is I think that and we've seen that decoupling from the Fed."
"5280740","5281360"," In the past."
"5283540","5287720"," I was that all last week man I see people up there spending money to doing this doing that. "
"5288580","5289480"," People are cranking."
"5289980","5292420"," No one's acting to me like they're losing their asses."
"5293080","5297240"," I know shit's expensive I know we're in a we're in a recession but they price that shit they pre"
"5297240","5298280"," price that stuff in. "
"5298940","5301880"," So we're not seeing the fall through yet on the other end of this."
"5301880","5305900"," So they're going to make a market to some extent aren't they or what are they going to do."
"5305980","5306420"," Crash it. "
"5307260","5307660"," Okay."
"5308200","5309460"," All right so fuck it."
"5309660","5310240"," Crash it. "
"5310340","5311920"," Crash it eight hundred thousand points tomorrow."
"5312540","5313020"," Do it."
"5313220","5314400"," Do it on this bed meeting. "
"5314720","5315520"," Do it on CPI."
"5316200","5316380"," Do it."
"5316660","5319040"," Do some magical bullshit out of your ass to do it. "
"5319100","5319860"," Whatever you do."
"5320960","5322700"," We've been sitting here waiting since May."
"5323020","5325960"," We've been sitting here eight months waiting for you to make it to take a shit and get out of"
"5325960","5326260"," the pot. "
"5326740","5330700"," Meanwhile you lost momentum coming up in the behind the behind the market and there's nothing they"
"5330700","5331380"," can do about it."
"5331460","5332440"," They don't have a fucking choice."
"5332720","5333700"," They just don't. "
"5334860","5338040"," Now they're left where we're going to trade this market up to the right."
"5338820","5342800"," We're going to crash it and you know you had your time to do it."
"5343000","5343960"," You didn't time it right. "
"5344460","5345420"," You fucked it all up."
"5346320","5347340"," Time to pay the piper."
"5349140","5349900"," That's my take. "
"5352780","5353940"," That's your car right now."
"5353940","5354020"," That's your car right now."
"5361840","5363320"," Yeah they fucked it all up. "
"5363400","5363940"," It's a disaster."
"5364200","5364920"," To me it's a disaster."
"5365520","5369060"," I'm trying to look back in his history and I'm like they fucked this. "
"5369280","5371080"," They were hoping for some shit to happen."
"5371540","5373160"," And I wanted it to happen too."
"5373340","5374760"," You got me on stream going. "
"5375180","5376840"," Please get unemployment rate through the roof."
"5377400","5377940"," Like I'm begging."
"5378840","5380940"," I'm begging for really bad shit to happen. "
"5380940","5383580"," I don't think there's a bull out there that doesn't want to have a bottom."
"5385400","5387960"," So I would love to buy fucking apple at five bucks."
"5388300","5390400"," You tell me a Tesla's at five dollars. "
"5390480","5391480"," I'll buy the fuck out of it."
"5391520","5391920"," I'm down."
"5393420","5396000"," So unless you can create some shit or whatever. "
"5396820","5399580"," My thought process here is we're going to find a bottom."
"5400860","5402580"," So I'm going to be looking to buy that bottom."
"5405020","5407180"," And I think it's going to take a few years. "
"5407480","5409940"," I think it's a few more years."
"5409940","5412900"," So if you want that magical five, 10, 15 year bull run."
"5413780","5415380"," Yeah, maybe it is in a few years. "
"5417940","5419540"," If they can get us a bottom to buy."
"5420640","5423520"," I don't know in the next month or two, next three months."
"5425060","5425860"," Show me the bottom. "
"5428240","5431840"," You know, and if you're not on that, if you're not on that same, same trade with me, then."
"5432480","5433460"," You know, good luck to you."
"5433620","5434640"," I hope that you get a."
"5435280","5436960"," We're at four hundred and five, right?"
"5436960","5438040"," Where are we at right now?"
"5438280","5438660"," Four or three. "
"5439800","5441380"," What kind of crash do you need?"
"5441920","5443780"," We already crashed down to three forty five."
"5444900","5445200"," Right."
"5445340","5446580"," We crashed down to three forty five. "
"5446800","5447200"," What do you want?"
"5447380","5447940"," It was three thousand."
"5448820","5450800"," You want a twenty five percent drop premiere."
"5451760","5452520"," That's what you want, right?"
"5452800","5453500"," Twenty five percent. "
"5454800","5456660"," By March thirty first, right?"
"5458300","5460780"," And I remember I'm not going to forget this."
"5461100","5464740"," You also told me that you wanted twenty percent from three forty five, right?"
"5464740","5466060"," I remember that too."
"5467140","5470520"," So, so you don't actually want twenty percent from here, right?"
"5470740","5471480"," Or twenty five percent. "
"5471700","5473280"," You want like fifty from here, right?"
"5473420","5474820"," Or thirty five from here, right?"
"5475320","5475900"," Something like that."
"5476020","5476280"," At minimum."
"5477760","5479480"," I'm going to start making some shit up. "
"5479600","5482440"," You better come up with a fucking story out of front right that."
"5482760","5484420"," I was asking some, I asked Phil last night."
"5484660","5485180"," I was asking Joseph. "
"5485480","5485860"," What could it be?"
"5486080","5486900"," It could be Iran."
"5487220","5491980"," It has to be something plausible to get like that fifty percent drop tomorrow."
"5492580","5494700"," It has to be something you can sell to everybody. "
"5495440","5499720"," Because you really do need like when you, when you have that capitulation move, you really do need"
"5499720","5502040"," like, you need like a bank to fail."
"5502240","5503300"," You need a company to fail."
"5504500","5507920"," You need some kind of unknown news to happen to justify. "
"5508380","5511760"," Yeah, we just, you know, I'm not going to name the events that have happened in the past because"
"5511760","5512820"," some of them are very tragic."
"5513520","5514940"," But you really do need that."
"5515680","5516900"," You really do need that. "
"5518020","5520120"," Some, some like hard reason."
"5520740","5524060"," So if you're not going to get that hard reason right now, okay, give me twenty."
"5524640","5525460"," Take me down to three grand. "
"5526460","5529580"," You can probably pass that bullshit off to get out from your shorts."
"5530560","5532140"," You can probably run a scam."
"5534000","5538740"," Assign that to some kind of reason why you're going to get your bottom. "
"5539040","5539720"," But I don't see it."
"5539880","5541620"," I need something better than."
"5543060","5546240"," I need something better than some of the reasoning I'm being given. "
"5547240","5552880"," To go down right now to twenty four hundred sixteen hundred fourteen hundred."
"5554480","5558760"," You know, to have that oh eight oh seven that two thousand."
"5559000","5560060"," I'm not anti that. "
"5560160","5562220"," I just don't see it without a reason for it."
"5565840","5568800"," Yeah, and Donnie or whatever that's not good enough for me."
"5569720","5571260"," Not right now it isn't. "
"5571500","5573980"," You guys don't you guys have never been to India."
"5574600","5575600"," You guys don't know."
"5576140","5577760"," I'm telling you don't know the corruption. "
"5577800","5579300"," No offense to Indians here."
"5581220","5584220"," No offense at all meant, but you guys know what the bureaucracy is."
"5585140","5586740"," I know what the bureaucracy is. "
"5587100","5588580"," I know what the butter chicken republic is."
"5588820","5589540"," I know exactly what's up."
"5591320","5592980"," I don't think Americans do. "
"5593280","5593820"," Often don't."
"5593980","5597100"," I don't think they can grasp the concept of an emerging markets."
"5597740","5600220"," You can look at that's kind of like going after China and saying. "
"5600780","5603780"," Yeah, we're going to fuck your whole political or your whole financial system up."
"5603780","5606840"," That's not going to happen."
"5614500","5615220"," That's not going to happen. "
"5615960","5616960"," Yeah, I need."
"5617100","5618060"," Yeah, you need the black swan."
"5618260","5618500"," I agree. "
"5618680","5619560"," You need the black swan."
"5619680","5620220"," You got to have it."
"5620280","5621220"," If you don't have a black swan event. "
"5622160","5623080"," We're not there yet."
"5623840","5624120"," So."
"5625080","5627700"," I can get down with three thousand and get down with thirty six hundred. "
"5629200","5630660"," I can get down with that."
"5631260","5632600"," This isn't your fault either."
"5632600","5634360"," If you're a bear, this is the feds fault. "
"5635480","5637560"," The fed is the fed is fucked this up."
"5639560","5640420"," That's they've done."
"5659850","5661470"," They should have done what bears said. "
"5662050","5663270"," They should have done real QT."
"5663990","5664590"," The Treasury Department."
"5665590","5666810"," They should have crashed at all. "
"5671400","5673180"," They should have done their work and they didn't."
"5681920","5682360"," Yeah."
"5689520","5692980"," Yeah, we had four PE ratios at three forty five of like fourteen. "
"5694540","5696140"," You know, like that's that's good enough."
"5696520","5697700"," Close enough for where we are."
"5697820","5698320"," Seems reasonable. "
"5705640","5707580"," You think they're going to hold us here?"
"5707760","5708660"," Maybe they get up all day long."
"5708660","5710080"," So I want to talk to you guys about something."
"5710540","5712400"," We're watching a little bit of lack of velocity here. "
"5712860","5714740"," We tagged four oh three forty six."
"5715980","5717680"," We're going to watch into the half an hour here."
"5717720","5718700"," We're coming into eleven twenty one. "
"5718780","5719460"," It's almost eleven thirty."
"5720440","5723020"," We're going to need to make a new high here in half an hour."
"5723520","5724920"," We're going to see if the bulls can get it. "
"5725040","5726420"," If they do get it, they'll get some continuation."
"5726420","5727980"," If they don't, we'll trade sideways."
"5728780","5731260"," And more than likely try to tag this into the bell today. "
"5732260","5733860"," We'll see what happens in the next ten minutes."
"5737660","5739360"," Well, I guess and so that's my point, right?"
"5739940","5741300"," So now I'm looking for a fucking bottom."
"5741580","5742800"," I'm on the phone with Joe last night. "
"5742920","5743920"," I'm like, what do I do here?"
"5744220","5745820"," I'm going to start to change my stance to bullish."
"5747300","5747340"," Right?"
"5747540","5750180"," If I was trying to change my stance to bearish."
"5751340","5753120"," And now I'm going to change my stance to bullish. "
"5754600","5758040"," Then I should be, I should be doing two things."
"5758380","5759820"," I should be looking for a buy of a bottom."
"5760060","5760580"," That's number one. "
"5761040","5764040"," And number two, I should begin to hedge the market."
"5767060","5768140"," So I'm looking."
"5768360","5769540"," That's how I went down the rabbit hole. "
"5769580","5770360"," I'm looking at SPX."
"5770640","5771220"," I'm looking at spy."
"5771520","5772140"," I'm like, okay. "
"5772460","5775160"," So I should now be expecting."
"5776320","5777520"," Two things, right?"
"5777760","5780280"," When you hedge, when you're not bearish and you're bullish and you hedge."
"5781080","5786280"," You're, you're, you're not saying we're going down to 390 or 380, right?"
"5787700","5793300"," You're going to protect against a market crash or an out way outside of the range. "
"5794280","5795100"," Tail risk."
"5795620","5796880"," Does that make sense to you?"
"5798640","5801580"," So I wouldn't buy a 403 put here."
"5802380","5803060"," Like right?"
"5803200","5803640"," We are right now. "
"5803720","5804860"," Wouldn't buy a 403 put."
"5804860","5806780"," For March 17."
"5807840","5810040"," I'd probably buy, it was right kind of like a top. "
"5810160","5811400"," We know where the top right now, right?"
"5811920","5812880"," We're not close to a top."
"5814520","5819720"," So I'd probably buy something outside the money and consider it a cost of doing business."
"5821220","5822840"," And so I was talking to Joe. "
"5823020","5828180"," I'm like, well, like, I could probably get a hedge for like 10 grand way outside the money."
"5829140","5830400"," And I'll buy it every quarter."
"5830960","5833160"," I'll just start buying a hedge down below on a high. "
"5834360","5839200"," If it, if it goes to zero, you know, it's, it's costing me doing business."
"5840480","5845520"," If it prints, let's say I buy a dip, as a matter of fact, I bought a dip, right?"
"5845620","5846820"," I bought the Lowe's on Tesla."
"5848040","5851140"," That would protect my, my investment on Tesla, right?"
"5851260","5856580"," If I want to hold Tesla here and dollar cost average in Tesla, if we go lower, I could probably"
"5856580","5862100"," look for a hedge that's slightly outside the money and cheap. "
"5863240","5868460"," And just let it burn if it needs to burn or holds its value over three months or six months."
"5869680","5874820"," And if we're going to, if, if the world goes into hell on a hand basket, I get paid, man."
"5875000","5880300"," I get paid big 10, 10 times what I would, uh, would have lost on that underlying position. "
"5880580","5884420"," But I think that's the ultimate, uh, where my thinking is going here."
"5886500","5888360"," And then this has nothing to do with day trade."
"5888560","5892040"," And this is just another aspect for myself. "
"5893380","5898560"," Uh, wanting to buy a bottom here or not get caught upside down."
"5898900","5908860"," I wonder if I was getting a fever there for a"
"5908860","5909100"," minute."
"5911540","5912680"," I want to have COVID. "
"5914200","5915660"," I've been going out a lot lately."
"5917380","5919620"," And I don't like, uh, being around people still."
"5919760","5921600"," I still haven't knowingly caught COVID. "
"5922700","5924640"," And I'm like, man, I don't want to catch that shit."
"5931020","5932540"," Yeah, I had an 11 30 right now."
"5932540","5933620"," We're going to see what happens. "
"5934540","5936000"," A five more minutes left."
"5941110","5942890"," But we tag the first one right here."
"5943810","5945270"," We're going to see if the bulls can do it. "
"5946350","5947430"," I wouldn't be, it wouldn't be."
"5947670","5951470"," So the, the hedge or the hedge, uh, the color doesn't actually have to hit."
"5952070","5957430"," Uh, because it's a spread, uh, there, there is a possibility we could, uh, do this bullshit and"
"5957430","5958570"," just do this at the end. "
"5958850","5960010"," Some kind of nonsense like that."
"5961670","5964450"," We'll see how this, how it plays itself out for the rest of the day."
"5965370","5966490"," You can begin to get new highs. "
"5967870","5968450"," Or not."
"5972930","5974250"," Uh, I do have an, I'll go running."

"5998300","6001000"," We're going to check right now and see 12 11 26. "
"6005170","6006990"," See if we can squeeze this up here."
"6008230","6009570"," Looking at, um."
"6011490","6017270"," 404 C's, 221,000, uh, calls on 100 on 403 C."
"6017930","6020630"," I don't really like them where that high and call on the call side. "
"6021430","6026090"," Once we get over like 200,000 calls on zero dates, sometimes it doesn't go up."
"6028310","6029850"," Well, I got my finger on 404."
"6030450","6031230"," We'll see if we can get up there. "
"6032490","6034770"," Uh, they pay 34 cents on 58 cents."
"6038170","6039250"," We'll see if we can get up there."
"6043350","6045070"," More sellers than buyers right now. "
"6046610","6050810"," Uh, if you want to know what I'm trying to buy here, there's a couple things."
"6051570","6053090"," I'm looking for this green line right here."
"6053910","6055270"," I'd like to see us touch. "
"6057390","6058710"," I'm wasting some time here."
"6058790","6061990"," I would really like to see like a quick liquidity break and then I move up here."
"6064290","6067290"," If you're following along and there's a little bit of a delay in the broadcast. "
"6069550","6071590"," You can, uh, go to the."
"6073510","6074530"," Let me unmiss this."

"6109390","6111030"," I'm going to retest the highs here."
"6113850","6117310"," Starting to squeeze now trading 61 cents on 404 C."
"6120250","6123530"," That just a couple more minutes left to see if we can squeeze up here and get a new high. "
"6124410","6129650"," If we can't get the new high here, I'm going to cut them loose and, uh, you can't have a"
"6129650","6131850"," failure of a new high in the previous trade here."
"6132410","6137750"," We need the new high for continuation need to have that new high right here."
"6140670","6145470"," If we don't get the new high, we're going to look for a low for a new low down below. "
"6151210","6156450"," If you look in the background here and see if, uh, I got to watch this fucking trade."
"6156910","6158310"," We're going to start talking with you guys."
"6159510","6165060"," I'm, uh, we're going to start talking with you guys. "
"6165980","6168400"," I'm, uh, I get caught in the trade."
"6170580","6173460"," Oh, yeah, maybe now trading 65 cents."
"6175880","6177140"," Oh, yeah. "
"6177920","6178960"," Oh, yeah."
"6179600","6186720"," Uh, we're getting some thrust here on the five minute coming up on the hourly."
"6192910","6196270"," Well, the five minute is coming screaming up on the hourly right now. "
"6201950","6205730"," If we get an liquidity break here, my stops are below the green line."
"6207170","6211910"," Uh, because we've got an unseen, uh, we've got an unseen."
"6212710","6214170"," Uh, five minute coming up right here. "
"6214250","6215370"," This is an hourly right here."
"6216350","6217170"," Or, no, I'm sorry."
"6217230","6217530"," I'm a bad. "
"6218270","6221570"," Let's see this, uh, yellow line right here."
"6221910","6228190"," Yellow line just came up and came up and came up and should squeeze this right now."
"6233950","6235790"," Get a nice fat squeeze coming here. "
"6245190","6246710"," You want it to hit."
"6246710","6250870"," Um, and I'm staying long here."
"6251010","6252290"," I'll show this line here. "
"6253850","6256450"," This line is now intersecting with the screen one."
"6258270","6259350"," Oh, hold on here."
"6259710","6260710"," We'll just get rid of that one now. "
"6261570","6264510"," So this line right here is now all screaming higher."
"6265430","6266590"," I wish you had a nice fat squeeze."
"6267430","6270310"," If there's liquidity break allowed to position, I don't think we're breaking this. "
"6270510","6271390"," I think we're just moving up higher."
"6294610","6296250"," Although I would like this breakdown here."
"6298290","6299270"," Be honest with you. "
"6305950","6307310"," They're not paying right now."
"6309690","6312610"," Just sitting in these calls trying not to pay them."
"6328430","6328910"," Yeah. "
"6343220","6347640"," You wanted to hit but I don't do it."
"6348720","6350240"," You wanted to hit."

"6522020","6523780"," My fact I was upside down when I closed them."
"6524440","6525860"," Got smoked on those."

"6785720","6786020"," now. "
"6788260","6791160"," I'm trying to sit it down the one minute right now here."
"6791300","6792580"," Be careful of liquidity break here."
"6793100","6795280"," Make sure some stops on your on your lungs. "
"6795360","6796320"," I'm going to show you this real quick."
"6797760","6799460"," They're going to try to push this down."
"6800640","6802560"," They may or may not be successful here. "
"6803240","6807840"," We do have this beautiful fat red line coming up this beautiful fat yellow line coming up."
"6808520","6815260"," I'm going to try to buy this if it happens for two sixty and I don't know that it's going"
"6815260","6819020"," to happen but if they do catch a quick liquidity break I'm going to try to jump in on that"
"6819020","6820860"," and add to my position."
"6824000","6825580"," I'm just hoping that they come down here. "
"6825760","6827600"," This is exactly where this is right here."
"6827940","6828800"," It's coming up right now."
"6829640","6834520"," I don't know if we hit it or not but if we do I'm going to add. "
"6834700","6836120"," This is not a sell down here."
"6836300","6837980"," This is this is an ad right here."
"6840440","6842660"," I want I want I want the big boys above. "
"6846660","6847940"," We ain't done going up."
"6853020","6854000"," Come on baby."
"6854360","6854840"," Print them up. "
"6855220","6859940"," So yesterday matter of fact this is a good this is a good this is a good lesson for you"
"6859940","6860400"," right now."
"6861020","6869460"," So yesterday I was in this trade very similar and we fucking rolled it and then we rolled it and"
"6869460","6871940"," it had printed at this point like 80 percent."
"6872940","6875340"," We had no follow through in velocity yesterday. "
"6875620","6875660"," None."
"6876500","6877480"," That was pissed."
"6878520","6879940"," And then we rolled it down and over. "
"6880080","6886820"," I took puts and it printed like 30 percent and then the first snap back it went below what I"
"6886820","6887520"," bought them for."
"6887720","6892120"," So these dealers are just like taking money, taking money, taking money, taking money."
"6896170","6898930"," I was very upset to say at least. "
"6900070","6904050"," As a matter of fact 400p in the bell went went to zero."
"6904470","6906390"," I don't know if you noticed that yesterday."
"6906590","6908010"," 400p's went to zero yesterday. "
"6908950","6909970"," That pissed me off too."
"6911270","6912170"," I was like damn it."
"6926580","6928600"," Nice little squeeze higher this morning. "
"6942760","6944160"," See if we can do this here."
"6947420","6950520"," Have a new high here on 1138."
"6951640","6954260"," We'll look for another new high by 1230 here. "
"6954900","6956100"," Should be the last one of the day."
"6963230","6967490"," Now trading 63 cents on 404c."
"6970190","6971410"," Just print it baby. "
"6972870","6973890"," Give me a dollar."
"6974410","6976810"," Only one is a dollar just give it a dollar."
"6976970","6977230"," I'll be happy. "
"6977650","6978090"," Give me a dollar."
"6978910","6980470"," Give me one full dollar."
"6981870","6983130"," One full dollar. "
"6984590","6986730"," Make it a nice fat dollar bill."
"6995900","6997560"," Now we're getting crispy here."
"6998520","7001320"," Put side of the equation here is is getting burned. "
"7001560","7002340"," They still have to burn."
"7002680","7005440"," They've got 23 cents left on 401p's."
"7005740","7007180"," 45 cents left on. "
"7007880","7010600"," 46 cents left on 402p's."
"7010720","7012940"," There's not a ton of money."
"7013220","7017200"," It's like 403p's or 82 cents but they're still not quite. "
"7017980","7019580"," There's not a bunch of concentration."
"7020300","7024840"," Most of the concentration I'm puts are on 400 and 401."
"7025500","7028400"," Getting a little soft right here to pay calls. "
"7031810","7033290"," I might have to cut these loose."
"7033730","7034350"," Take money and run."
"7037510","7038210"," Get close. "
"7038830","7042070"," I'll probably try to jump back in down below in the five minute down here."
"7043110","7046210"," I was thinking I might hold him and add down here but there's not a lot of money left."
"7047690","7052010"," I might have to cut these loose and reposition down here for this move. "
"7052730","7052750"," I"
"7052750","7065430"," don't"
"7070870","7092000"," want to take that."
"7113370","7122380"," 15 minutes left into"
"7122380","7123920"," the hour."
"7125580","7127640"," I'm going to try to throw this over now. "
"7128100","7131920"," What they need to do is get underneath this yellow line here."
"7134100","7141020"," They're going to try to throw this over right down here and try to send this down."
"7142640","7143620"," That's going to be the plan. "
"7145600","7151470"," I'm going to leave this up right now for you."
"7152190","7168790"," Be careful if you're a second here."
"7176550","7178270"," Give me your first target right here. "
"7186190","7188190"," You're able to get underneath this yellow bar."
"7189030","7192970"," That would be your target and then down to retest new lows down here."
"7193950","7198890"," A box down there. "
"7198890","7201270"," This"
"7221020","7248620"," will"
"7256810","7256810"," be a lower target down here."
"7257360","7258750"," I'm still sitting in calls here."
"7276060","7282450"," If you're a bearish here, a likely path would be down right here. "
"7282450","7283450"," Rejection."
"7284210","7285710"," Then you move down here."
"7302870","7303900"," Getting close. "
"7333300","7336300"," Come on baby hold."
"7338000","7352130"," Come on"
"7352130","7352370"," baby."
"7405900","7407100"," Last chance here for the bulls. "
"7408300","7409340"," Here we get in the one minute."
"7409500","7428980"," We're going to go down for"
"7428980","7436180"," a 3-0-7 close enough."
"7443380","7460340"," Oh they're trying"
"7460340","7461280"," right here aren't they?"
"7466110","7467510"," They want a bloodbath this. "
"7485850","7488490"," I'm going to get stopped out here in just a minute here."
"7500270","7501650"," Boy are they fucking trying."
"7503970","7505450"," Come on. "
"7521130","7522580"," Squeeze them the fuck out."
"7525450","7527490"," Come on baby."
"7532000","7534260"," There's some heavy sellers in here. "
"7542390","7543210"," Here a bull."
"7545330","7548330"," It's kind of like your last chance to get out if they throw this over."
"7550110","7551250"," I'm still long here. "
"7559790","7562710"," You get a rejection here and it's going to be fucking good night."
"7565550","7566610"," Time is right now."
"7566830","7570410"," 11.52 you get an 8 minutes left for the bears to throw it over. "
"7579980","7581840"," Now trading 51 cents."
"7587240","7588080"," Come on."
"7588340","7589280"," Squeeze motherfucker. "
"7590780","7591340"," Seriously."
"7592840","7594540"," Give me some of that pin love."
"7603570","7605430"," Show me that pin love above. "
"7608670","7611130"," Show me some of that pin love above."
"7615490","7620050"," Show me that pin love baby."
"7627300","7628260"," Come on. "
"7631900","7633820"," Show me that pin love above."
"7634680","7636580"," Not trading 55 cents."
"7640090","7641070"," Oh man. "
"7642610","7644110"," Fucking this is like yesterday."
"7646190","7648150"," Making me work for my money this week."
"7649730","7651570"," Making me stay awake at nighttime. "
"7654990","7656890"," Making me trade micros."
"7659930","7660790"," Come on."
"7663130","7664050"," Come on. "
"7665270","7667690"," Take all that micro put money away."
"7668570","7670850"," I saw that micro put money this morning."
"7671670","7672390"," I saw it. "
"7672490","7673070"," It was on 403."
"7673570","7673950"," Let's go."
"7675910","7676610"," Squeeze it. "
"7688790","7690990"," Now trading 56 cents."
"7691010","7691670"," Excuse me."
"7705150","7706070"," Come on. "
"7707210","7709150"," Now trading 55 cents."
"7714550","7715230"," Come on."
"7715550","7716410"," Rocket fuel up. "
"7717190","7718550"," Give me the rocket fuel."
"7720910","7722170"," Hold the one minute."
"7723350","7725770"," Oh do you know how much work that took right there?"
"7726830","7728550"," That took a lot of work right there. "
"7731750","7733650"," That took a lot of work."
"7735390","7738430"," It took a lot of fight right there just to get there."
"7739110","7740670"," That was no joke right there. "
"7744850","7746990"," That took a whole lot of work."
"7751460","7753740"," This is where we lose it right here."
"7754380","7756220"," If you're a bull, you probably want to get out here. "
"7758580","7760620"," Just get out before it goes down."
"7763700","7764900"," Get out before the roll."
"7767580","7768000"," Abandoned chip. "
"7770700","7771760"," I'm still long here."
"7771900","7772600"," You shouldn't be though."
"7772940","7775120"," This is usually the reversal candle. "
"7775360","7776640"," If there's a reversal candle, this is it."
"7777440","7778360"," Usually this one right here."
"7779440","7780820"," You don't want to see a red one here. "
"7781360","7782140"," You want to see a green one."
"7785470","7787590"," The bulls are winning this candle right here."
"7787790","7788810"," This is this is positive. "
"7789530","7793170"," If you saw like a big red candle right here, this would be no hold on."
"7793370","7795070"," You'd seen a big red candle right here."
"7795990","7798350"," If this had been a big red candle, it would have been ugly. "
"7802800","7805780"," You're looking for no reversal on this blue line right now."
"7806440","7809020"," So basically what you're looking for is you know, they're sold it down."
"7809980","7810840"," Come back up. "
"7811260","7812460"," Bulls think they've got it."
"7812900","7815160"," They put a big red candle right here and that's it."
"7815160","7820160"," Just start selling just like that. "
"7823010","7829490"," But you can see the wick on this red candle means bulls actually fought back on this red candle and"
"7829490","7830850"," they should start pushing it up now."
"7837660","7838700"," Come on."
"7838960","7839780"," Come on. "
"7840300","7842360"," Now trading 56 cents because I don't want to pay."
"7845220","7849320"," Oh man, they're going to try to do it again."
"7853890","7854770"," C4062 they got. "
"7856530","7860270"," 4062 they got 366 a big block of sellers up here."
"7870970","7872070"," I'm just hanging out here."
"7872150","7872530"," I'm not selling. "
"7873290","7874470"," Why are we spent here?"
"7879130","7880490"," Highly likely we're going up here."
"7881850","7883670"," So I ain't fucking selling for anybody."
"7883930","7884490"," Here you go. "
"7885730","7886950"," I ain't fucking selling."
"7888550","7890090"," Now trading 59 cents."
"7890830","7891850"," Now back to where we were. "
"7892150","7892710"," 59 cents."
"7893210","7897190"," Actually, I think we're at 68 or 69 cents back here."
"7902430","7905310"," I'm trying to shave 10%, 20% off the trade. "
"7921700","7922420"," Come on."
"7923280","7925020"," I'll put the financial squawk on here."
"7929830","7933430"," I'll read some news off to you as well while we're waiting here. "
"7937090","7938430"," Not much news today."
"7939630","7941430"," They have the meeting going on here today."
"7941650","7944730"," And that's the other thing you have to think about is that tomorrow we get a rate decision. "
"7945970","7950430"," So you have to wonder if anyone takes the money and runs at some point today and tomorrow's."
"7950550","7951530"," We're going to talk about this right now."
"7951650","7954290"," It's 11.58. We only have four minutes left in the day. "
"7955170","7957090"," I'm going to end up taking a break here at some point."
"7958110","7962890"," We're just going to talk about tomorrow and the implied move for tomorrow."
"7963750","7965190"," What to expect for tomorrow. "
"7969530","7971150"," And we're going to talk about some stuff."
"7971290","7972150"," We're going to look at some stuff here."
"7975630","7981550"," No, I saw I got an email yesterday and the day before I was going through my email. "
"7981730","7983430"," I'm a lot of time right now."
"7983650","7987390"," So I've got DMs and text messages, phone calls."
"7988390","7991210"," I have two different emails that I have to check every day. "
"7991790","7996410"," And so if I were to just do that stuff, I probably wouldn't do anything else."
"7997330","8000530"," So I didn't get around to check emails until yesterday."
"8001130","8002590"," I saw an email from spot gamma. "
"8003550","8011510"," They made some really good points here that they made a point about some rate hikes that we've had"
"8011510","8016790"," and how we've traded up into those meetings and that we typically sell off into those meetings."
"8020600","8023680"," Oh yeah, my daughter has a pool party count for a birthday."
"8025460","8026780"," I got something I got to do. "
"8028560","8029040"," Okay."
"8033660","8037280"," So we're going to look we're going to look briefly here."
"8037960","8040480"," So I've got some call they're trying to kill these calls. "
"8040720","8044440"," They're not trying to kill them like they're not trying to kill them like we're not going to go up"
"8044440","8044580"," here."
"8044960","8046500"," They don't want to pay them if we go up there."
"8046600","8047140"," Does that make sense?"
"8048160","8059990"," So I'm going to put a stop on these just so that just in case it's low,"
"8060370","8061390"," but it's like 40 cents. "
"8061850","8064570"," So if they don't print these, I'm going to at least get out here."
"8065290","8067390"," My my expectation is that we go up here."
"8067670","8070010"," Okay, that's my expectation is that we go up here. "
"8071210","8073190"," I don't know if it's now, I don't know if it's in a day."
"8073850","8074850"," I don't know what it is."
"8075810","8079850"," They're probably going to squeeze this up, try to get good positioning for tomorrow. "
"8081670","8086130"," So that's what I'm hoping for is that we can squeeze up at some point."
"8086410","8088730"," I think a bear out there would want to take a put here."
"8089310","8092770"," If a bear had a choice, they're going to want to start from a pie. "
"8094390","8096250"," You guys know that it's all about positioning."
"8101370","8102310"," Yes, I will."
"8102810","8103390"," I got you Joe. "
"8105610","8106970"," We're going to look at a couple things."
"8107270","8110070"," Okay, when is a hold on a second here?"
"8114590","8115190"," Hold on."
"8121860","8124280"," Fucking trying to fucking sell me out of this shit still. "
"8124460","8125180"," Right now they are."
"8125540","8129680"," These fuckers Okay, so we're going to talk about tomorrow."
"8130200","8136400"," We're going to get it out of the way for tomorrow so that we can do you guys have a"
"8136400","8137760"," firm idea what to expect tomorrow. "
"8138180","8140640"," So let's just look at a one month chart."
"8142340","8143460"," Excuse, I may be getting sick."
"8144660","8149600"," So according to the Wall Street, the US has violated the nuclear arms treaty by blocking"
"8149600","8154480"," inspections potential attention over Russia's invasion of Ukraine at risks and danger in"
"8154480","8159260"," cooperation of nuclear arms control and negotiating a successor to the new start treaty. "
"8159820","8164000"," Again, this is coming from the Wall Street Journal here as reading into this here."
"8164320","8170060"," Russia has violated the new start treaty cutting long-range nuclear arms by refusing to allow on"
"8170060","8171200"," site inspections."
"8172280","8174620"," Man, Russia, what a fucking shit. "
"8174760","8185140"," So you think that Russia would have some kind of rational person they"
"8185140","8185740"," just don't."
"8185980","8188420"," Okay, so you see that golden cross right there?"
"8193240","8201900"," Remember when we talked about this, we said if we fail here and trade under what to expect."
"8206340","8210840"," Remember what we said about if we trade up here, we want to hold this. "
"8211420","8214620"," If we come down, we want to hold this right and regain it."
"8216340","8218280"," We said we don't want to break this over here."
"8219920","8221440"," There's a couple of things I want you to understand. "
"8221580","8224940"," We've put the full piece from the Wall Street Journal out on the feed for those interested."
"8228139","8231180"," This has been our trading zone since 11-10, right?"
"8232559","8234340"," This has been our true range up here."
"8235200","8237500"," We've got this range here that we're trading in. "
"8238620","8241540"," I want to get rid of this stupid shit now."
"8241680","8243940"," This stupid golden cross here means nothing."
"8244610","8245820"," It actually doesn't mean shit. "
"8247379","8248700"," Let me see if I can get rid of it."
"8252459","8253540"," It doesn't really mean anything."
"8254020","8254780"," This means something. "
"8256120","8257320"," See that trend there?"
"8259260","8262240"," It's kind of like kind of like bears, right?"
"8262459","8263100"," Make a bear happy."
"8263920","8265660"," Makes sense, right?"
"8267139","8267820"," Maintain trend."
"8275850","8277230"," I'll get rid of this for now though. "
"8277290","8279629"," You don't need this, but we know what trend is, right?"
"8280930","8283790"," Following trend going back for some period of time, at least."
"8285389","8287969"," Bear is going to tell you they want trend to go back to what?"
"8288190","8288790"," Oh, this over here?"
"8288889","8289290"," I mean that."
"8290490","8293469"," I mean the normal trend we've been on for a long, long time, that trend. "
"8297090","8298790"," I don't know why I can't get rid of this."
"8299770","8300629"," I'm looking for a weekly."
"8302830","8304809"," Or they don't want the screaming high. "
"8305389","8306490"," They don't want to see that right there."
"8306490","8308209"," This is what they're talking about this."
"8311850","8313350"," That's probably what they're talking about. "
"8319309","8319750"," Okay."
"8326120","8329620"," Just see like kind of a different chart here, right?"
"8332850","8337690"," If you start looking back, starting with the spy here, it starts to look a little bit different,"
"8337690","8338030"," right?"
"8339049","8339990"," Traded a little up here."
"8340170","8340629"," We sold it. "
"8341330","8343410"," Came back down, found some demand down here, right?"
"8345150","8348950"," So we know we've got some demand down below here, right?"
"8349070","8350290"," We know this is known demand."
"8350530","8352129"," We know we have demand here, right?"
"8355370","8363730"," Or not, no, we're going to anticipate that we have some demand down here, right?"
"8365490","8368049"," You can do this on your own at home or whatever it is."
"8369150","8371190"," You can say, you can pause it. "
"8371410","8376129"," Nothing's guaranteed in this market, but you know that buyers stepped in down here."
"8378780","8380600"," You know, this is where they originally stepped in."
"8380740","8383400"," You also know that more buyers stepped in right here, right?"
"8384559","8385280"," They rotated. "
"8385940","8386520"," This was banks."
"8386799","8387379"," This wasn't retail."
"8387600","8388700"," This was banks, right?"
"8391620","8396640"," So I'm going to put this in here too, because this is, we know that they bought this right here. "
"8397320","8397740"," Makes sense."
"8399740","8400980"," Bears have some work to do, right?"
"8401520","8403420"," They want to destroy demand down here."
"8408720","8410720"," They want bears have work to do down here. "
"8411700","8418500"," Now, we also know that previous experience, now we've had sellers above here."
"8418540","8419280"," I'll try to show you this."
"8419740","8420220"," Sellers here. "
"8421240","8421980"," Sellers here."
"8422940","8424440"," Sellers here, and they failed."
"8425200","8425920"," That's big, right?"
"8427880","8428460"," You see that?"
"8428780","8430700"," New lows, new lows. "
"8431800","8435740"," They came back in and said, fuck you, we're going to crash right here, right?"
"8436340","8437420"," This is like the death now."
"8437920","8444320"," This is my point to you, is that the bears said, not the bears, but sellers said, wam, new low."
"8445920","8450240"," And the bears said, fuck it, we're coming in even lower, bam, and we're going to break through"
"8450240","8451540"," this, and they failed. "
"8452160","8452780"," You know what I'm saying?"
"8454500","8457320"," Demand came up and said, nope, we're going up."
"8458160","8461540"," And sellers came in and said, or sellers came in and said, we're going down."
"8461960","8462700"," And buyers said, no. "
"8463200","8469440"," So we're in this point here where we have a battle between sellers and buyers."
"8470860","8472140"," And this is important."
"8472440","8473600"," This is zone right here. "
"8473740","8482920"," I want you to realize that this zone right here is major, because you basically are saying that we"
"8482920","8485080"," have demand, and we have sellers here."
"8485080","8486140"," This is key."
"8486880","8492760"," And this is my point was that this is a key support for bulls. "
"8493040","8495460"," If they lose this support, this actually doesn't mean anything."
"8496360","8500040"," This means that these sellers above of one, and we're going to find a new low down below."
"8500580","8506240"," This is where you get the three, you get the confidence from a Mike Wilson saying, we're going down"
"8506240","8507420"," 20%. "
"8507420","8515920"," So he's saying, if these buyers are removed from the equation, we're going down down to new lows."
"8516420","8516440"," Okay."
"8517440","8519060"," So bulls need to hold this. "
"8519240","8520520"," They need to hold like, what is that?"
"8521540","8524860"," 376 for 46."
"8526220","8527440"," That's what they need to hold."
"8527480","8528100"," And I'm a choice. "
"8530780","8532460"," Now we can break trend here."
"8535560","8536820"," We can break trend here."
"8537760","8540560"," Our bull can break friend here, but they can't give up. "
"8544890","8547270"," We can break trend here, but they can't give this up."
"8547410","8549870"," If they do, we're ass blasting down."
"8550250","8553150"," So if you're like a bull, and you're like, whoa, when do we take a short captain?"
"8554510","8558130"," There's some places to take shorts here to make some money. "
"8558530","8560490"," If we break trend, there's a short here."
"8560870","8561670"," There's a big one, right?"
"8562110","8562850"," Huge short down here."
"8564690","8565090"," Right. "
"8565190","8568570"," But you take the money and run, and then you re-enter the trade for the big bloodbath, right?"
"8568850","8570810"," There's a big trade right here is a big trade right here."
"8573390","8575910"," And I don't think 36, 3500 holds."
"8576230","8577130"," I mean, you'll get a bounce here. "
"8577290","8581050"," It won't be like clean, but you would get like you'd get the trade here."
"8581970","8583330"," Take the money and run, right?"
"8583590","8584770"," Probably get a rejection here."
"8585310","8588050"," You'll come down and retest 3600, right?"
"8588290","8588970"," Come back up here. "
"8589270","8591790"," It's not going to be clean, but it's pretty much guaranteed."
"8592730","8596490"," And I would bet on this, believe it or not, us getting down here and hitting that 3,200."
"8597250","8600890"," If we break this key level, it's like the bull's key level. "
"8601390","8602270"," Cannot give this up."
"8602270","8602810"," Big bad."
"8603550","8604950"," Bad, bad, bad, bad for bulls. "
"8607470","8616790"," Now these sellers came in coming in for a year, came in here, and demand said, nah, nah, nah, nah,"
"8616990","8619990"," nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah."
"8621550","8622290"," Sorry, buddy."
"8623050","8625450"," Been doing this ship to us for 13 months. "
"8625790","8628790"," He did it to us 12 months before on other indexes."
"8628790","8630750"," We're now going up."
"8631750","8641250"," This is what the bears need to understand is that if we don't break that 396, and"
"8641250","8647750"," this is what I was talking about yesterday, and I'm going to show you this one more time today, is"
"8647750","8649810"," that there's some momentum coming up here. "
"8650350","8657230"," Just like this, weeklies, dailies, monthlies right here."
"8658970","8662230"," And so this is another key support for bulls."
"8663310","8665430"," Bull's need to believe it or not hold. "
"8668810","8670350"," I think it's 393."
"8670550","8673090"," I'll check it right now where it is."
"8673730","8674730"," Give me a second here. "
"8674810","8676130"," I'll exactly where it is."
"8676250","8677150"," Like to the pin."
"8677810","8678610"," I'll tell you where it is. "
"8680390","8680790"," 395."
"8681210","8682410"," We're going to do an SPX."
"8683670","8687430"," We'll do it on SPX so you can you can chart this at home for yourself. "
"8687430","8697730"," So you know, you know exactly 396 3 right here."
"8699210","8703190"," And 395 2, right?"
"8707710","8711110"," This is the key for bulls for being bullish."
"8712490","8713190"," Okay. "
"8714990","8717630"," This is the key for bulls heading into tomorrow."
"8718690","8725810"," Now I don't care if we swing down here and hold this again into into drone pile."
"8729350","8734330"," Bull's don't want to see, you know, a blast down tomorrow and then a hold under here. "
"8734690","8735550"," That's bad for bulls."
"8736270","8737890"," That's the spot gamma trade."
"8739370","8741010"," That's when we blast down tomorrow. "
"8741790","8746510"," We don't hold this true range right here."
"8747250","8748430"," We start heading lower."
"8748610","8749830"," This is bad news for bulls. "
"8751170","8755250"," Now if you're watching FOMC tomorrow, I'll be here with you."
"8755730","8757070"," We blast down here."
"8757230","8759390"," We hope we come back in and hold this right here. "
"8759670","8760450"," That's fucking bullish."
"8760970","8763130"," Give a fuck what the spot gamma tells you."
"8763830","8769670"," And believe it or not, all this hysteria out there that you see, there's hysteria. "
"8770290","8772910"," I see hysteria in social media."
"8773130","8777290"," I'm warning you if you're a bear, you break above this on FOMC."
"8777950","8780030"," No, we react to trades, right?"
"8780210","8781550"," We don't care for going up or going down. "
"8781710","8782570"," We react to trades."
"8783130","8785670"," There's only one thing bulls should be watching for tomorrow."
"8787070","8788770"," You break this right here, right?"
"8789910","8795290"," And just going back to our original conversation that I had on on SPX here, right?"
"8795830","8798370"," You're telling a bear at that point. "
"8799230","8800410"," Oh, fuck no, bro."
"8801570","8804550"," You won that shit in 2021 in December."
"8805490","8806190"," Way back there. "
"8808030","8811650"," And you won it on the index, as you won it on the index, as you won it on the"
"8811650","8815410"," index, as you won it on the indexes, and this time you didn't."
"8816430","8818630"," So I'm going to, I'm going to pose a warning to you."
"8819290","8820210"," Now we could do it. "
"8820310","8822730"," I'm going to give you step three to our option three."
"8823110","8827150"," And that would be where we swing higher, believe it or not, tomorrow when the ball comes off."
"8828090","8833150"," We trade back down in here and believe it or not, we just trade this range into CPI. "
"8834470","8835570"," Well, it's not that far."
"8835750","8840430"," It's like you swing up here and this is where we swing in here waiting for CPI."
"8840770","8846650"," If CPI comes in a third inflation coming down, this is where we're fucking going and we're going to"
"8846650","8847770"," decouple from the Fed. "
"8847930","8848410"," It's right there."
"8849530","8849970"," Okay."
"8850710","8856390"," So for all the bearishness out there, which I think it's, I think it's legitimate here to be"
"8856390","8856810"," bearish. "
"8857410","8859430"," Now our bearish in the short term, right?"
"8859590","8861710"," Maybe bearish in the next two to three months."
"8861970","8862550"," I'm fine with that."
"8863030","8865530"," I'm looking for a bottom to buy, but I will tell you this. "
"8866050","8868130"," I will warn your ass if you're a bear."
"8868550","8876790"," If we swing high here and hold above this area, this zone here, just going back and showing you how"
"8876790","8883530"," demand and selling right from above and demand down below is this is like a, this is like a"
"8883530","8888410"," corkscrew just wound up, just wound up waiting to release its energy."
"8889970","8895770"," And between FOMC and the CPI, we're going to get a leg, giant leg. "
"8896290","8897150"," We're going to get a leg here."
"8897710","8898870"," We're going to get a leg down here."
"8898990","8899870"," I don't know which one it is. "
"8900350","8901970"," I don't care which one it is."
"8903170","8903890"," And you shouldn't either."
"8904450","8908450"," And I'll tell you what, I wouldn't be, if you were bear or bull, I would not be like, I'm"
"8908450","8908890"," long here. "
"8909210","8911810"," Like, let's say you're like, I'm a bull and I'm long here, I don't care."
"8911910","8912350"," We go up."
"8912690","8913950"," I'm going to say it was lucky. "
"8914530","8917350"," If you're a bull or a bear and you're like, I'm short here."
"8917450","8917930"," Fuck you, cap."
"8918150","8918490"," I don't care. "
"8918590","8919050"," We're going down."
"8919270","8920430"," I'm going to call you lucky too."
"8921470","8924330"," You're trying to anticipate what this move is going to be. "
"8924390","8927110"," And I'm going to tell you that I would not do that."
"8927330","8932430"," There is there's a there's a compression of of momentum right now."
"8932490","8933370"," There's very dangerous. "
"8933930","8935370"," And you don't want to get caught in the wrong side."
"8935490","8938730"," I guess if you are positioned that way and it goes the wrong way, I guess I would say to"
"8938730","8942370"," you, if you're a bear and you're like, I want to call the exact fucking top."
"8943150","8943970"," Well, then you do. "
"8944370","8951530"," But I want to warn you, if we start going down here, any of this, or no, I'm sorry, if"
"8951530","8956230"," we come down here and bounce back up, right?"
"8956230","8960230"," Don't fucking lie to me on Fintuit, but like I closed, don't tell me afterwards, you know, I could"
"8960230","8966970"," close the cap, have a stop here, have a stop here, take profit, wait for confirmation that runner"
"8966970","8968410"," needs to take the next trade."
"8968990","8972290"," I want you to before we get there, be like, okay, I'm bearish here, Captain."
"8973470","8977210"," I want you to take the trade, take the money, right?"
"8978090","8980890"," Wait for the rejection, take the money down here, right?"
"8981790","8985650"," Then take the money here, and then wait for confirmation below to take the rest of it. "
"8986430","8990850"," This is where you get fucked up as a retail trader, you're just like, you're just like short or"
"8990850","8991370"," just long."
"8991970","8995810"," Every time we break through a level, you take the money, you jump back in for the next level down"
"8995810","9000670"," when it confirms on a rejection, because I know what truly happens."
"9000670","9005670"," I know why 97% of people can't trade, and that's because they fucking stay in their trades. "
"9006190","9009990"," Instead of trading to a number or a target, they stay, right?"
"9010350","9015430"," This is where the comments come out where the people say, I hold my puts until expiry or until"
"9015430","9016350"," they're, until they're worthless."
"9016670","9018010"," That's the, that's how the way that comes from."
"9019030","9024490"," Now, how would I, or how am I going to be positioned into, whoa, what's going on?"
"9026710","9027970"," What's going on right now?"
"9032430","9033550"," Are we going to start squeezing?"
"9035110","9036430"," I smell it, you smell it?"
"9037410","9041830"," Anyways, my point to you is this, is that into tomorrow, right?"
"9042610","9044070"," I want to remember these numbers right here. "
"9044150","9047330"," I want you to see, this is the lower end of candle on 125, okay?"
"9048630","9052650"," I want, this is the lower end of the candle on 125, this is the higher end of the candle"
"9052650","9060250"," on 127, the 25th and the 27th, the low and the high, is what I'm going to expect for return"
"9060250","9061330"," to mean, right?"
"9061450","9062610"," We're going to return to that number."
"9062870","9064390"," We're going to attract back that number."
"9064430","9065450"," We're going to wait for CPI. "
"9066430","9071670"," The funniest fucking thing that could happen tomorrow would be we swing high and low, come back to"
"9071670","9075730"," the center and the, and the, and the dealers say, thank you for fucking playing."
"9076510","9081850"," We nailed you with premium and now we're going to wait for CPI and then, which wouldn't even shock"
"9081850","9084910"," me to see spot chemical and say, yeah, it looks like they're waiting for CPI."
"9085550","9088110"," That, that wouldn't shock me for a minute, right?"
"9088390","9091770"," So you get the trade in for, for FMC, then they wait for CPI, you get two weeks. "
"9092570","9092950"," That's right."
"9093210","9093990"," I think it's going to happen."
"9094150","9094830"," I can be wrong on that. "
"9095270","9096590"," And I have a friend here."
"9096710","9097710"," He's in stream right now."
"9097770","9098690"," He seems to disagree. "
"9099310","9104630"," He's like, this fucking CPI print is going to be so fucking low that they have to sell this market"
"9104630","9110850"," tomorrow and get it down into the 14th as far as they can because we know we're going to rocket"
"9110850","9111410"," ship up."
"9111770","9113170"," That makes sense to me too."
"9113750","9115430"," Like I can respect that trade too. "
"9116210","9117690"," I can respect that trade."
"9117950","9120310"," My point to you though is if you're going to, if you're going to, if you're going to front run"
"9120310","9125310"," it and make a guess, make sure you know where the, where the sellers are here."
"9126370","9128750"," Know where the demand is down below, right?"
"9129030","9129670"," Supply is here. "
"9130070","9130610"," Demand is there."
"9130710","9131350"," The demand is there."
"9131770","9133670"," Know that bulls are going to show up down here. "
"9133850","9134670"," That doesn't mean they win."
"9135370","9138630"," That just means that you take the money and run at each level, right?"
"9138790","9139970"," Let's say you're going to trade this down."
"9140170","9140970"," Take the money and run. "
"9141270","9144190"," You wait for confirmation that we're going to go continue like lower."
"9144710","9145670"," You take the money and run."
"9145870","9148210"," You wait for us to bleed back through and then you take the next leg. "
"9150770","9154290"," Do you get what I'm making money by the way?"
"9155130","9156550"," Am I making money out there?"
"9156670","9156910"," Whoa."
"9157850","9159670"," Looks like I'm making money right now."
"9160570","9161690"," Holy shit. "
"9162290","9163390"," I'm making money."
"9164670","9166310"," Am I burning right now?"
"9166470","9167330"," I think I am burning."
"9167910","9168570"," I smell green. "
"9169870","9171810"," I smell a lot of green out there."
"9173530","9178710"," Smells like my calls are fucking printing right now."
"9179990","9181370"," That's what it smells like. "
"9182610","9188770"," Smells like I'm getting a new high right now and I'm trading 66 cents on 404 C's right now."
"9188790","9192210"," Now 67 cents on 406 C."
"9192350","9193610"," Now 68 cents."
"9194390","9195870"," Am I getting a new high right now?"
"9195870","9197390"," They're just getting a new high. "
"9211010","9211410"," Yeah."
"9221620","9225040"," So if you want to take the short into the close today, I'm down with that."
"9225140","9225800"," I'm fine with that. "
"9226440","9230620"," More than likely what they're going to do tomorrow in Tefam C is going to be a bunch of fucking"
"9230620","9231140"," sweaty."
"9232520","9235060"," 50 cents US bank spending by high."
"9235360","9241600"," And they're going to trade this shit up and down and they're going to use all these classic setups"
"9241600","9244900"," with some fucking triangles and some expanding wedges. "
"9245380","9247320"," And they're going to do some stupid shit tomorrow."
"9248020","9250660"," And then they're going to get your your answer tomorrow."
"9251500","9253560"," Probably going to get a little bit of weakness into the bell. "
"9253740","9256900"," I'm not getting not guaranteed or they sell it down on the open tomorrow."
"9257820","9259580"," Weakness into the actual decision."
"9261300","9263880"," And then you're going to get the 230 PM Jay Pokemon. "
"9264540","9265620"," And that's the next part of this."
"9266040","9267380"," So this is all you really need right here."
"9267540","9268040"," This is all you need. "
"9268260","9269100"," That's all you need to know."
"9269640","9270060"," That's it."
"9270440","9279140"," I will warn you that if now and the inflation report, if any of that shit is bullish, there ain't"
"9279140","9280700"," nothing stopping us heading higher. "
"9281080","9281880"," There ain't shit."
"9283020","9291600"," Because it'd be the first time that demand and supply has met and demand has taken over."
"9292120","9300200"," So now if I'm bearish in tomorrow or let's say you're a trader and you're bearish in tomorrow, you"
"9300200","9304320"," need to understand that if we say it above it ratings are cool on the beat through with it. "
"9304320","9306620"," You gotta switch your mindset immediately."
"9307720","9312020"," If you're a bull in tomorrow and we start we start slamming down."
"9312500","9316280"," Don't be sitting there stroking yourself and calls thinking it's coming back. "
"9316540","9317040"," You get what I'm saying."
"9317200","9322160"," So you have to go to move from bullish to bearish depending upon what the price action is telling"
"9322160","9322740"," you tomorrow."
"9323160","9323920"," I'm going to be aware of that. "
"9324240","9328600"," If it was me and you were me and I was you, we used to be able to trade."
"9329460","9331260"," I had this conversation with a close friend."
"9331360","9334440"," We used to be able to trade going on over here. "
"9334520","9336280"," Oh, is that a big green ball in the back?"
"9336480","9337900"," Wait a minute."
"9338140","9338540"," Wait a minute."
"9338680","9339560"," What's that right there?"
"9340700","9341800"," What's that right there?"
"9342940","9349400"," So if you're going to ask me what I'm going to do tomorrow, normally on FOMC meetings and minutes. "
"9350080","9354760"," Now the shit that spot gamma was quoting, I don't care if that comes true or not."
"9354960","9356180"," I'm going to assure you of something."
"9357040","9366940"," All those previous instances that spot gamma was quoting, you would be able to go into an FOMC"
"9366940","9368040"," minute or meeting. "
"9369000","9375900"," And you would find one side of the options chain fucking loaded in one side of the options chain"
"9375900","9376940"," not loaded."
"9377600","9382180"," Literally, I'd walk in and be like, it didn't matter if it was a minutes or a meeting or a"
"9382180","9382700"," rate decision."
"9383140","9384200"," I'd walk in and be like, shit. "
"9385560","9389060"," And the money puts for zero dates are like eight dollars."
"9390380","9391240"," I kid you not."
"9391420","9392280"," It was a no exaggeration. "
"9393160","9397820"," And then I'd walk in the call side and I'd be like, motherfucking calls are 15 cents."
"9399980","9401260"," So I'd take the call side."
"9401380","9403060"," I'm known for this known on Twitter for this. "
"9403320","9407620"," So I'd go in there and be like, like the last five minutes or 45 or 15 minutes of like,"
"9407660","9409520"," I'm loading the fucking boat on calls right now."
"9410000","9411500"," And people be like, what the fuck are you doing?"
"9411620","9412040"," That's so crazy."
"9412040","9416040"," I'm like, hell no, they can't pay these people that are in eight dollar puts right now. "
"9416080","9416940"," They just can't pay them."
"9417020","9417420"," They're not gonna."
"9417960","9418820"," Sure enough, we'd rip. "
"9419660","9424640"," Then the next event I'd go into and the call side would be loaded like $10 calls."
"9425260","9426820"," And it'll make five cent puts."
"9427060","9428180"," They'd be like, how is this happening?"
"9428880","9430560"," So we did this shit for two years. "
"9431020","9432040"," We did it on fin to it."
"9432800","9433440"," Two years."
"9434580","9434960"," We did it. "
"9434960","9436400"," We did it here on YouTube too."
"9436700","9437940"," And I'm just like, but this is fucking awesome."
"9438120","9441280"," Every time I come in with stupid fucking events, it's lopsided. "
"9441580","9446200"," Now the last two or three FMCs, shit's like meetings, minutes, whatever."
"9447280","9449300"," They've been everyone knows now."
"9449660","9451320"," So now you got too many people. "
"9452280","9453760"," And the dealers know better."
"9453900","9458300"," So they're like, Oh, we're gonna charge the bulls five bucks and we're gonna charge the bears five"
"9458300","9458540"," bucks."
"9459100","9463220"," So personally, for me, I probably won't trade the initial trade. "
"9463420","9465760"," I used to take the initial trade before the announcement."
"9466660","9473560"," At this point, I don't want to pay anybody five dollars to be in a trade right at the presser."
"9473820","9476420"," So I'm going to be looking for the reaction trade tomorrow. "
"9476980","9479500"," I'm looking for what do we decide to do?"
"9480160","9483940"," Do we decide to break above here and come back down and start moving higher?"
"9485100","9489620"," Do we squeeze higher and start to roll over and come back down?"
"9489780","9490360"," I can short this."
"9493800","9497060"," Do we break back down then regain it so I can take along here?"
"9498960","9503200"," Do we start bloodbath and it rejecting here so I can get a short in tomorrow?"
"9503680","9504120"," Does it make sense?"
"9504620","9511800"," So I want you to know that over the past year, maybe year and a half, they know what we're"
"9511800","9512140"," doing."
"9513020","9517640"," The boiler rooms know, the banks know, fintuit knows, everybody fucking knows. "
"9518640","9520040"," That used to be a beautiful thing."
"9521060","9521700"," No one knew."
"9522420","9524100"," We were trading it when no one was trading it. "
"9525020","9528600"," Well, if you want, I'll go back and find them and I'll repost them on fintuit."
"9530160","9532600"," But right now, it's just too many fucking people."
"9532940","9534340"," It's not worth your time. "
"9534740","9537300"," I'm going to tell you something right now if you're a bull or a bear."
"9537480","9541100"," I don't care where we go tomorrow, but you mark my words."
"9541520","9543660"," Remember my words I'm going to give to you right now. "
"9545340","9551500"," And that's that some of you tomorrow are going to walk in, let's say with 10 grand, and you're"
"9551500","9552660"," going to leave with zero."
"9553420","9557540"," And I don't care if, I don't care if you're a bull or a bear."
"9557880","9559480"," I don't care if you pick the right direction. "
"9559960","9562880"," I assure you, you're going to leave with zero."
"9565040","9569560"," So we can sit here all day long and make money most days, right?"
"9569700","9570700"," We sit here together, we trade."
"9571620","9574260"," We make easy money, easy money. "
"9574520","9577280"," I have one bad day, then I have five good days, right?"
"9577660","9578240"," With you guys."
"9579080","9580800"," So how do you trade FMC?"
"9581800","9582480"," Fucking decision?"
"9582840","9583360"," You don't."
"9583980","9584860"," We'll sit here tomorrow. "
"9585140","9590480"," We'll fuck off if there's a trade that comes up, a reaction trade that comes up."
"9590580","9590980"," We'll take it."
"9593260","9595380"," If there is no reaction trade, we just wait. "
"9595760","9597940"," We wait till the vol burns off, right?"
"9598060","9598900"," The vol comes off."
"9599260","9600800"," If the move is down, we'll know it."
"9601660","9602900"," We'll know the move is down. "
"9603360","9604780"," If the move is up, we'll know it."
"9604780","9605600"," We'll know."
"9605980","9607480"," And we wouldn't have lost a dollar. "
"9608140","9608720"," We didn't participate."
"9610120","9610740"," Does that make sense?"
"9611820","9613760"," Now, some of you are going to be like, now, fuck you, Cap."
"9614260","9615360"," I want to take that trade. "
"9615640","9616500"," Now, I'll be here with you tomorrow."
"9617040","9621160"," If you're one of them crazy bastards who wants to take a five dollar trade for 30 cents, you'll see"
"9621160","9621440"," tomorrow."
"9621820","9626640"," It used to be, it used to be, you could take like a 15 cent, literally 50 cent trade, 15"
"9626640","9628540"," cent trade turns like five dollars. "
"9629720","9634600"," Now you're like, you're going to pay three dollars or pay five dollars for 30 cents."
"9635440","9636400"," That's what you'll have tomorrow."
"9636620","9638280"," Like I just gave you three dollars. "
"9638680","9643440"," Can you imagine taking a bet with me and I'm like, okay, I'll take your three dollars and the most"
"9643440","9644780"," you're going to make is 30 cents."
"9645020","9648020"," And if you fucking pick the wrong direction, the three dollars is mine."
"9648360","9652580"," I'll bet with you guys on the phone in day one, you guys ever want to DM me and bet"
"9652580","9654560"," me three for 30, I'm down. "
"9655780","9656380"," I'll beat you up."
"9656640","9657980"," I'll take every dollar you have."
"9658420","9659920"," And that's the point of tomorrow. "
"9663150","9665510"," The point of tomorrow is take all of your money."
"9666050","9669790"," Point of tomorrow is for you to put the risk on the line and not the dealers."
"9670830","9672230"," And that's what it is. "
"9672550","9674890"," So heading into tomorrow."
"9678070","9679090"," That's my plan."
"9679230","9682750"," My plan for tomorrow is to let the market decide which way we're going. "
"9683390","9685950"," I could care less and truly."
"9687350","9692430"," There's some market forces coming up from underneath and they really need to hold under that for"
"9692430","9693230"," that market crash."
"9693690","9697410"," If they don't hold underneath that force that's coming underneath the market right now and you're a"
"9697410","9699690"," bear, you're going to get your fucking ass blasted. "
"9700270","9701070"," I'm warning you."
"9701290","9702410"," I'm going to give you one time warning."
"9703630","9707510"," Okay, if you do not break that force that's coming up for underneath the market, I'm going to show"
"9707510","9708590"," it to you one last time here. "
"9709610","9710570"," I'm going to warn your ass."
"9713930","9714690"," One time."
"9716670","9717890"," You see this right here?"
"9718510","9719650"," That's not a moving average. "
"9720810","9722030"," That's not a moving average."
"9722510","9723870"," If you don't break this, right?"
"9724850","9726410"," You can't break this right here."
"9726510","9728590"," This is coming back from a decade ago. "
"9729430","9734670"," If you can't break underneath this and hold this, you are going to get run over."
"9737410","9738890"," Run over."
"9739830","9741050"," Like straight run over. "
"9742250","9743770"," So have a plan to exit."
"9744790","9746790"," If you get run over, starting to get run over."
"9748170","9751110"," You can see here how you take profit at each level, right?"
"9751890","9755550"," You can see here, you're like, yeah, captain super blud, super bearish, right?"
"9755750","9758070"," We take the money when you hit that shit, right?"
"9758450","9762490"," You want to see, stay underneath this, the hourly, then you take the next trade. "
"9763330","9765350"," So I just, that's all I'm going to say it once to you."
"9765590","9771390"," I know you guys are being fed on public, on social media and shit, a story."
"9772130","9773430"," I know you're being fed a story. "
"9773710","9777130"," Until it proves itself to me, we have not broken trend."
"9779550","9781090"," You can tell me any story you want."
"9782250","9784890"," Tell me any story you want, but so far we haven't broken trend. "
"9785170","9787050"," Even yesterday, I haven't broken trend."
"9787730","9792470"," So or Sunday into yesterday, price hasn't followed market breath."
"9793030","9793750"," Not nothing. "
"9793870","9794730"," I'm not seeing anything."
"9795110","9796790"," Now I'm not saying we don't crash tomorrow."
"9797390","9805470"," I'm saying to you that nothing has proven your thesis at this point, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,"
"9805470","9806850"," zero, zero, zero, zero. "
"9808150","9809130"," I want proof."
"9810510","9811170"," And I'm down with it."
"9811450","9812130"," I'm with you. "
"9812130","9813410"," I'll put the boop bear suit on."
"9813890","9815810"," We start trading blasting through here."
"9816010","9817270"," We start putting on the bear suit. "
"9817470","9818110"," I'm down with you."
"9818190","9819090"," That shit still hasn't happened."
"9823020","9823920"," I'm down with it. "
"9824520","9828020"," I would love to buy Tesla at 60 or 40 or 20 or whatever the fuck it is you want"
"9828020","9829240"," to do, but still hasn't happened."
"9829440","9830100"," So I'm sorry."
"9831800","9835520"," Just being coming to you from the US State Department is the United States remains ready to work"
"9835520","9839060"," constructively with Russia in order to implement the new start treaty. "
"9839540","9843680"," The state department says that Russia has a clear path for returning to full compliance of the new"
"9843680","9848360"," start nuclear arms treaty by allowing inspection activity on its territory."
"9849100","9853460"," Also says that Russia is not complying with obligations under the new start nuclear arms treaty to"
"9853460","9855840"," facilitate inspection activities on its territory."
"9856340","9859900"," We committed to see the Wall Street Journal reporting this earlier, but just in confirmation from"
"9859900","9861400"," the State Department itself now. "
"9862120","9866220"," Now they do also say that the new start treaty remains in the national security interests of the"
"9866220","9866780"," United States."
"9868620","9869620"," That's my only point."
"9872880","9873880"," You're a fin to it. "
"9873880","9876560"," And they're like, yeah, but it went the way that I thought it was going."
"9877300","9878220"," That's called anecdotal."
"9879700","9880700"," That's all that is, anecdotal. "
"9881260","9883980"," You should be trading to make money all the time."
"9884540","9886760"," You should be trading, trying to protect your money all the time."
"9886900","9894160"," If you meet somebody in public or in fin to it or on Reddit or whatever, and they lab to"
"9894160","9895540"," you and say, look, it went down. "
"9895680","9897260"," I'm like, that doesn't mean anything to me."
"9897780","9900380"," The only thing that matters to me is money, always."
"9900960","9902780"," And it should to you in wealth preservation. "
"9903400","9905920"," There are people out there, they get a paycheck, they burn it every week."
"9906900","9909940"," And then one week it hits and they come up to you and go, look, it went that way."
"9910020","9912420"," And I'm like, I don't listen to you. "
"9913200","9915980"," Nothing to share with you or take from you."
"9916780","9918940"," You should be following people that make money every day."
"9919120","9923640"," You should be following people that make money make this as a living and how they survive in this"
"9923640","9924080"," environment. "
"9924360","9931340"," And it's certainly not, even if they're telling you, they're either selling you a service or"
"9931340","9935880"," selling a fee to you or they definitely are not positioned that way."
"9936380","9937800"," They delete tweets all the time."
"9938260","9940360"," They delete posts on Reddit and stock tweets. "
"9941360","9947140"," They come back on their fucking blogs and shit and they explain shit away."
"9947480","9952680"," So I want you to realize that someone that's got skin in this game, more than likely, is going to"
"9952680","9954040"," trade the reaction trade on this."
"9954580","9958780"," More than likely doesn't have a hundred thousand dollars on this shit going down, even though"
"9958780","9961020"," they're telling you and whatever you're watching. "
"9961800","9962620"," And that's what they have."
"9963880","9968640"," If they if they did, right, that's my other favorite one, I was finding some people I was looking"
"9968640","9972500"," back earlier a week or two ago, and I'm like, man, all these motherfuckers that were short at 380."
"9973540","9981900"," You think that their brokerage allowed them to stay margin is when you trade with margin. "
"9984060","9989480"," You tell me the brokerage that let's let's ask up to 410 and you stay short or the hit you"
"9989480","9991760"," would have taken huge money."
"9992520","9994120"," There's no one to fucking hear it from people."
"9994120","9999400"," I'm like, when you guys be careful who you watch, when you follow out there, you got to understand,"
"10000040","10004780"," I'm saying, be careful because they're as soon as you're being sold a story and eventually it comes"
"10004780","10006040"," true, right?"
"10006220","10006800"," But not always. "
"10007960","10011800"," And when it hasn't come true since October, fucking 12th, I start to question people."
"10013660","10015820"," It's fucking January 29th."
"10017060","10017900"," Three months later. "
"10021950","10022870"," Three months later."
"10023030","10024250"," Yeah, you might be right this one time."
"10024510","10024710"," Sweet. "
"10024990","10025370"," You got it right."
"10025930","10027470"," We crashed tomorrow on FOMC News."
"10028390","10030710"," You've been fucking short since my buddy of mine. "
"10030830","10035210"," I was like, I've been short since fucking he was like, I've been short since the 07 crash."
"10035290","10039790"," And I'm like, Oh, my great granddaddy gave me some shorts from from the great tulip."
"10041190","10042610"," Great tulip short. "
"10043370","10045770"," Like, this is nonsense."
"10049130","10051530"," You know, so this market goes up."
"10052430","10053350"," I want you to know that. "
"10053590","10055590"," It's not it's not easy being a bear."
"10055730","10056350"," It's not easy short."
"10056790","10064130"," So if I was you, I'd just be sitting on the sidelines, man, take a reaction trade tomorrow. "
"10064870","10065930"," Don't lose all your money."
"10074160","10075280"," We closed on Friday."
"10075680","10076820"," Do you guys remember on Friday?"
"10077500","10079200"," Do you guys remember this past Friday?"
"10080200","10083700"," Do you guys remember this past fucking Friday when we fucking traded?"
"10084360","10088240"," And I said to the first group, I said, if you're a new trader investor, take your money and run. "
"10088840","10091680"," And then I said, if you're a seasoned trader, I'm live streaming over here."
"10091700","10092940"," We're going to trade the next one up."
"10093260","10097820"," And then we had this cool ass guy for his name, career idol or something was like, wrap it up,"
"10097940","10100180"," boys, we're out of here literally at the top. "
"10101020","10102640"," And we closed out what's on the tape."
"10103220","10104220"," You can go back and watch it."
"10106100","10108480"," So, you know, to be that trader is not easy. "
"10109040","10109800"," That shit's hard."
"10110280","10113120"," It takes years of experience trading."
"10114500","10116460"," So I don't know, be careful out there. "
"10116840","10117800"," I just want you to be careful."
"10119860","10120920"," Speak careful tomorrow."
"10122140","10124140"," I don't think anyone can call the direction tomorrow. "
"10124140","10127160"," I don't think they can."
"10127400","10130620"," And I think even if we go down tomorrow, you need to know about CPI."
"10131020","10132860"," You need to know about the ranges. "
"10133380","10134960"," You need to know about where to take a profit."
"10147480","10148940"," Yeah, yeah, you guys can ask."
"10149660","10151740"," This whole crew is here with us. "
"10152960","10154080"," You can see my friend."
"10154260","10155740"," I posted on fence to it on Friday."
"10156600","10158340"," You can just check my fucking posts. "
"10164200","10166720"," You just take my post history and fence to it, too."
"10167380","10172060"," We put it on the tape and we put it on fucking public before it happens every single time."
"10177330","10178370"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"10178610","10179290"," It's career low."
"10180070","10180990"," What's up, brother?"
"10182950","10184030"," It's career low."
"10184470","10185610"," That's my G right there. "
"10186010","10186370"," That's current."
"10186610","10187430"," That's the guy right there."
"10187490","10188070"," It's career low. "
"10188950","10189610"," Fucking G."
"10192710","10193590"," It's career low."
"10193770","10197330"," We got to make him a, you know what, we're going to hold on a second."
"10197530","10198050"," We're going to do it. "
"10198210","10199250"," We're going to do something here."
"10200990","10202170"," Hold on a second here."

"18412370","18419610"," Where supply is where demand is and why it's important Uh on a macro view point of the market and"
"18419610","18427830"," why it's all coming together right now into this um Into this like a compression right into um Even"
"18427830","18428870"," though we're trading higher today."
"18428990","18433050"," We're coming just like corkscrew of compression And we're probably going to make a leg higher or"

"18439470","18444430"," cpi Uh big tech earnings Are you going to expect a leg at that point?"
"18444790","18450290"," Even if we pull back a little bit Even if we pull down to like 380 375 or some it"
"18450290","18456110"," could still be going up here a squeeze higher We can always be oversold in our bots and put can"
"18456110","18462030"," put take a leg right Um, you can take a leg higher a leg lower and you'll still get pullbacks,"
"18462030","18468130"," uh or rips Um depending on which direction we're taking but there is a leg coming Uh, you should"
"18468130","18479830"," need to be aware of it Um so that you know how to be positioned for that next leg Okay,"
"18479910","18488410"," so I'm going to look briefly at gnrc as we're rolling over a little bit here gnrc uh genaract Uh"
"18488410","18496010"," very bullish right now Uh, there is uh a sell side to this trade I want you to be aware"

"18525110","18531550"," have take a break or something Trade up here come back down The key here is that you want to"
