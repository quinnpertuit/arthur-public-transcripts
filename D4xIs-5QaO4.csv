"9200","49370"," would like to say, what"
"49370","58070"," really matters for the economy is not the novel rate so much, you know, the 5,000,000 rates on"
"58070","58390"," rest."
"58810","62270"," It's the real rate, you know, that rate minus the inflation rate."
"62470","63810"," That's what matters for the real economy. "
"64150","64970"," We just want to say there."
"65190","69670"," If we're correct and inflation recedes going further and the Fed keeps going further."
"69670","74190"," If the normal rates on hold, then the real rate is passively going to go up. "
"74830","77590"," And so, yes, the Fed may be done right now."

"84990","86930"," Nice squeeze overnight last night. "
"86990","88790"," You're making a pass of tightening in terms of the real rate."
"89270","92470"," And then you're looking at, you know, effects in through next year."
"92470","95810"," And in fact, we are seeing the real 10-year yield. "

"275110","276650"," Okay, so let's get started here."
"277250","278850"," We got some stuff to look at."
"279670","289450"," Now, supposedly, this morning, we've got something listed here that says"
"292830","298170"," beneficials to speak at the Jackson Hole Summit. "
"299070","303170"," I'm looking right now for some kind of a live cast on this."

"337290","341090"," with the thumbnail for the video this morning was kind of two-fold."
"341530","342670"," Well, first of all, let's stop."
"342870","347570"," Well, before we even, I don't know if we get into the Jackson Hole thing right now, but we're going"
"347570","355130"," to have a longer extended conversation today about the conversation we had yesterday in regards to"
"355130","363950"," the expectations from Jerome Powell of the expectations of what to expect from him until next year. "
"366350","370010"," Just onto the topic of the open this morning."
"373990","379150"," I posted on Twitter patients, and so we're going to talk about that real quick here."
"380010","385430"," Now, you'll see down here, you'll see this hourly trigger down here is likely going to correspond"
"390610","391910"," right down below here. "
"392010","393810"," So, we're going to keep our eyes on this this morning."
"395430","397250"," Let's see if this hourly trigger will hold."
"398570","400430"," Not the daily trigger, hourly trigger. "
"402610","405610"," So, right down inside of here right here."
"410010","411410"," We're going to switch over."
"411590","412610"," Let me see if I can switch over. "
"412810","413890"," Let's show you guys this here."
"414170","419030"," China Foreign Ministry official says new members should be emerging economies and possess regional"
"419030","420790"," and strategic global influence."
"428750","433150"," Okay, so I want you guys to look at a couple things here. "
"435210","436690"," We're not a couple, but a few things."
"437110","440370"," Just so you have like a situational awareness of the market and where we are."
"440990","444310"," So, the first thing we're going to do is look at ES, okay. "
"444870","451250"," So, on that open this morning, I'd like to watch ES and SPX, not just spy."
"453590","458490"," So, that first band that you just saw on book map is showing this band right here."
"460490","463090"," On ES, and I want you to see this here. "
"464190","472710"," I want you to see this right here that we're sitting on this right now because hourly trigger and"
"472710","478590"," ES specifically is bearish right."
"479430","485490"," Came above the daily trigger on ES bounced around coming back down to test the hourly right now"
"486970","497150"," currently and this is a cell signal for the market now on SPX not"
"497150","498170"," so much, right."
"500570","503730"," This doesn't look silly, silly at all right, it looks pretty good. "
"503990","507350"," So, ES giving us a warning of negativity."
"508230","512370"," If you were to just look at ES right now, ES and all things are bad here."
"513350","515990"," Now, price is rejecting off SPX. "
"517350","519110"," Let's see the price is right here."
"519970","525350"," So, there's that first pull up and then this pull back right here and this is showing an even lower"
"525350","527150"," target, right."
"527970","535910"," And then where that hourly trigger is showing, it's a 4415, 4410 in cash market to the downside. "
"539330","547040"," Spy, we have our initial push up and over."
"549000","550800"," All right, price goes up and over."
"551020","553520"," We talked about two things here. "
"553520","559860"," We talked about this yesterday and we said price when it breaks above the daily trigger will not"
"559860","567060"," hold until it doesn't even have the opportunity to hold until the hourly trigger can't get above"
"567060","567300"," there."
"567460","575120"," So, the idea here would be you'd expect price to come down and at least test that hourly trigger at"
"575120","575520"," minimum."
"578300","580220"," And that's that minimum, right. "
"580520","590750"," And even if we continue up higher here with the hourly trigger, and that's the HT right there, you"
"590750","593250"," would still expect some kind of a grinding action here."
"594270","604130"," Even if it squeezes up here, comes back down, you're still going to want to see that would"
"604130","606090"," be more than likely your actual confirmation."
"606650","608670"," Not this. "
"609170","610230"," That's not confirmation."
"611790","613030"," Not confirmation."
"613950","616070"," This would be confirmation here. "
"617910","626870"," And if you are a you're an Elliott waiver, I always make fun of Elliott waivers, but I"
"626870","636910"," know what they're doing out there and I know that somewhere up in here and in here, Elliott"
"636910","639750"," waivers are expecting a failure."
"644150","645990"," They don't know if they're going to get it right here."
"648210","650870"," They don't know if they're going to get it right in here. "
"653570","654770"," But they're expecting one."
"655370","659370"," If you're an Elliott waiver out there, you have your racers and all that kind of stuff."
"662000","664360"," Pay attention to this right now because it's pretty important. "
"664940","670660"," Okay, they're expecting a failure and you know where they're expecting us to go way lower."
"677770","678730"," So we got a speaker."
"678950","683910"," Let's see if we can get a read on the see if we can get this in a quick second"
"683910","684130"," here. "
"685490","696740"," If we get some actual, give me a couple seconds there, we'll see if we can get an actual like"
"696740","698140"," 10 minutes until that happens."
"699440","702880"," So just up inside here, I want you to see something here."
"705740","716720"," There's an expectation here that there's a failure awaiting us somewhere in"
"716720","716900"," here. "
"717100","720640"," It could be on that 448 right where we are or even higher."
"721400","729700"," Either way, whether it's here or here, there's an expectation that oh, this is where we're headed"
"729700","730320"," down here."
"733120","740240"," So that patience thing that I was talking about this morning, that post that I made on Twitter, the"
"740240","743960"," number one, your seller is going to think this is it right here, right?"
"744120","745220"," They're going to be like, nope, this is it. "
"745640","746560"," You're not getting the failure."
"746700","747080"," I parrotch."
"747120","747620"," It's going to be up here. "
"748240","753180"," We're going to blast down into the weekly trigger down here at this 427."
"757440","763820"," So if you're a bull here, do you care much about this here?"
"764180","764800"," Probably not."
"767260","778740"," Well, you probably don't and you're further probably looking at, can"
"778740","780400"," I get this?"
"780700","781300"," There we go. "
"787070","789370"," This is all kind of garbage in here, right?"
"789370","792490"," It's kind of all garbage in here a bull."
"792910","795550"," I don't know if this is even worth messing around with."
"795770","802530"," I don't know that any of this is worth kind of, I guess, if you're above the five minute 27"
"802530","803870"," EMA, you can trade this. "
"804470","812470"," The real key here was going to be getting above this area here, these sellers then squeezing these"
"812470","813270"," people out above."
"813930","823440"," So let's take a look at it right now on the main screen here."
"827210","832230"," Let's go to a five minute chart and there's a big old bear. "
"834310","839730"," It's a big old bear playing here."
"839830","840230"," You see this?"
"840690","842170"," You see that right there?"
"843650","846330"," It's kind of like a trap for bulls, right?"
"849770","850610"," Five minute chart."
"852070","857810"," Now right now price is below the 27 EMA on a five minute. "
"857910","858850"," What do we say about that?"
"859030","860030"," What's our rule about this?"
"861350","865170"," The rule is that we're not buying this, are we?"
"865490","866710"," We don't buy that right there."
"869010","874130"," So currently we have a bear plane and we're below the daily trigger, right?"
"874370","878330"," We're below the 27 EMA, not conducive to a bull."
"879850","888110"," But what is conducive to a bull and that is so city groups say OPEC may need to cut again"
"888110","889530"," as fragile members recover. "
"891250","893970"," We're talking about oil today too and TLT."
"899410","909340"," You see price come back up here, confirm that 27 EMA, begin to"
"909340","910620"," attempt to make its way higher."
"911720","916260"," Start thinking about some kind of a trade here. "
"916900","922020"," But until you see price above that 27 EMA, you really don't have a trade as a bull."
"922960","923600"," You know what I'm saying?"
"923860","925760"," And I don't even like this kind of like sloppy to me."
"927560","929760"," Most reversals don't end like this. "
"930000","939820"," So even as we come up into this zone right here, I'm going to draw a little box here"
"939820","941060"," and make it red."
"944640","948160"," It's kind of like the last stand for these sellers right in here."
"949600","959420"," So one minute chart right up in here, I'm going to watch what the reaction is"
"959420","964440"," in here if there is a reversal of the downside from Fed's hawker who speaks straight back down. "
"964540","968260"," You see from the Kansas City feds Jackson Hole economic symposium."
"968260","981200"," And I'm not really even interested in this as a bull unless it comes back up and begins to every"
"981200","982440"," reversal right there, right?"
"984000","985620"," Some like that right there."
"992240","993200"," Makes sense. "
"993760","995540"," Wait for all this to play itself out."
"995700","1000420"," Don't be putting risk on the table down here and I'm like yeah about the dip cap."
"1000420","1000920"," I'm all good. "
"1001120","1002820"," Like this is all danger zone for bulls."
"1004800","1006120"," Definitely a trap for bulls."
"1006480","1007400"," It doesn't mean you don't go up. "
"1007520","1009440"," Just means this is a five minute chart right here."
"1010720","1012540"," Means have some patience in here."
"1016820","1019520"," You don't want to get trapped in this and then roll to the downside. "
"1019660","1021620"," We never tagged the actual hourly trigger."
"1022320","1024800"," We need some time for the hourly trigger to come up here."
"1025020","1027240"," So just give it some pay have some patience. "
"1027240","1031240"," I guess it would be the the talk for today."
"1031540","1039020"," Now saying that going back to Turkey's rate hike is a more forceful step to moving real rates to"
"1039020","1042079"," positive territory making the lira more attractive."
"1049080","1055400"," Saying that going back saying all this at this point right going back to the triggers. "
"1056520","1061360"," The greater point here is this big white line right here."
"1061920","1064020"," This rejection trade to the downside."
"1066220","1068400"," Okay I want to show you two things here. "
"1069160","1073080"," Look at that line because that's not important."
"1073640","1078780"," What I want you to come back and look at is three things."
"1079620","1083880"," The first one is right here. "
"1090240","1095220"," These are some no playing around no joke and Mike Burry type of people."
"1096360","1099060"," These sellers right here are not kidding."
"1100220","1105780"," These are the people that are out there that will tell you where the top screw you if you're a"
"1105780","1108800"," buyer your run is done. "
"1110000","1113620"," You get no attempt at all-time highs."
"1114700","1117800"," Not even a failure of an attempt at all-time highs."
"1118200","1120320"," You don't get all-time highs. "
"1121020","1122840"," You don't get your 480."
"1123680","1127400"," Your thesis down the road in the next year is dead."
"1128900","1131100"," That's these people right here is where they are right now. "
"1132840","1135500"," And you have you have real doom and gloomers."
"1137140","1137920"," What's the second here."
"1140040","1142240"," You got real doomers up in here. "
"1145160","1149540"," These guys these guys up here say guys but I will call them women."
"1151560","1155340"," We're always using the masculine here so we'll use the feminine."
"1155980","1159300"," These women up here they don't want us going anywhere near this here right. "
"1159860","1163280"," So you've got two danger zones here for bulls."
"1163840","1164420"," Pretty simple."
"1165060","1167200"," You're a new trader, a young trader. "
"1167920","1171660"," Want you to know if these two zones right here are the danger zones for you."
"1171840","1177670"," Now let's look at these two."
"1182880","1184620"," Bring this back right here. "
"1185580","1186840"," What makes that significant?"
"1190320","1191440"," That's right here."
"1191620","1192580"," Let's go back over here."
"1195080","1197920"," This is the last place that we sold off right here right. "
"1202570","1204730"," Gonna nice squeeze and smooth right now."
"1204770","1211190"," Getting above that red box right."
"1211530","1215150"," And also getting above that bear plane. "
"1216070","1217750"," So right back over here."
"1218730","1220050"," Pay attention to that."
"1221050","1221630"," Right. "
"1221850","1224070"," This is the one where they said oh you get the failure right."
"1224890","1228190"," We didn't we didn't get towards the actual failure up here."
"1231410","1232690"," That would be the failure. "
"1233430","1242860"," That's 466.04. That's the real failure at all time highs."
"1243460","1245480"," And then we have above all time highs."
"1246380","1250200"," That is right here. "
"1253720","1255580"," 468 65."
"1257720","1259440"," Now this band up here."
"1261100","1262480"," That's the big boy right. "
"1264120","1265160"," This one up here."
"1265280","1266100"," I guess we'll put that there."
"1266420","1269520"," We'll put one more right below it right there. "
"1272800","1276120"," This would be above would be the actual new high."
"1276120","1285960"," And we made a video four weeks ago now where we said as we come up"
"1285960","1291740"," here you're going to expect violence."
"1292700","1299460"," You know get nasty pushbacks nasty pushbacks nasty pushbacks right. "
"1300020","1301340"," Trying to exaggerate this."
"1301940","1303960"," Expect kind of the same thing up here."
"1305220","1306260"," Nasty pushbacks. "
"1306680","1309000"," And even to get up there it's not going to be pretty."
"1309580","1310560"," It's not going to be fun."
"1312420","1315200"," And as of right now we've hit all of these. "
"1315500","1317560"," We haven't hit this one."
"1322100","1323400"," Haven't hit this one."
"1326180","1328520"," Let's head back over to the 30 minute here. "
"1334170","1336110"," Right here the last two we haven't hit."
"1336110","1342370"," And you know this isn't going to be fun in here right."
"1343050","1344430"," Kind of see where they are. "
"1345490","1347370"," You know you got sellers over here."
"1348590","1349710"," Serious people right."
"1350590","1352130"," More serious people right here. "
"1352970","1355770"," Then you got these these magic souls up in here."
"1355870","1356550"," You know they're there."
"1357210","1358730"," You know they're there right there. "
"1358870","1360070"," You know they're here and they're here."
"1362230","1363410"," And it's not going to be fun."
"1363710","1364950"," They're not going to make it easy on you. "
"1364950","1367550"," There's no possible way that they're going to make it easy for you to."
"1368210","1371230"," This is not meant here to be easy."
"1371770","1373710"," And you can see that last cell up here. "
"1374150","1376170"," You actually see another cell back down here."
"1376410","1378050"," But we're like no no no no we're out of there."
"1378750","1379670"," Right come back down. "
"1381510","1383570"," So we're going to see how this plays out."
"1384010","1385530"," So be careful in here."
"1387390","1388950"," Trade this zone to zone. "
"1390070","1392150"," All that kind of stuff we trade zone to zone."
"1392770","1394250"," Some kind of a deal in here."
"1394630","1395770"," And then above here. "
"1402590","1405350"," Let's take a look at the spy real quick and see what's going on."
"1405530","1406630"," Spy coming above."
"1409610","1411510"," Watch this little green right here. "
"1412810","1417270"," Get the price right now coming above right."
"1417890","1420090"," Or blast down excuse me comes back up."
"1421030","1423510"," Back down right now to test that half an hour. "
"1424250","1427330"," There's a half hour trigger in here to sneak in inside here."
"1427470","1428070"," See it right there."
"1428790","1429970"," Half hour trigger right there. "
"1431970","1436450"," Let's see if this thing can hold and the half hour can bring it up and squeeze it higher."
"1437410","1438650"," And what's that target up there?"
"1438810","1450620"," 448.04. I'm"
"1450620","1452100"," going to switch over to something really quick."
"1452700","1453800"," Leave this up for you. "
"1454220","1461070"," Let me see if I can get this one quick second here."
"1478080","1482980"," So the WTO issues the panel report regarding Chinese duties on Australian barley."
"1485100","1487320"," Let me see if this all goes what we're looking for. "
"1488060","1494800"," The two-year yield right now three basis points higher right around 5% 4.99 to be precise."
"1495680","1496620"," Next in focus of course."
"1496720","1497880"," I'm going to keep this on the background here. "
"1498840","1499880"," I'm John Tucker."
"1502500","1506180"," I guess barber school would not be in your future."
"1506240","1507720"," It was an accident. "
"1508080","1513220"," As I say I was a little bit keep your eyes down below here at the time."
"1515200","1518200"," And yeah just no explanation."
"1518340","1520900"," You got to check anytime you're trimming your bead. "
"1520960","1522500"," You got to check on the length of the sharp."
"1523040","1524540"," Reversal in progress right now."
"1524740","1528780"," I'll tell you one who's still sporting a pretty sporty beard and that's Bailey Lipschalki joins us"
"1528780","1531140"," here in a Bloomberg interactive broker's studio. "
"1531140","1532520"," Bailey will look at a healthy beard."
"1532820","1533460"," That is a solid."
"1533460","1536120"," I will say I don't trim my beard for that exact reason. "
"1536280","1538760"," It happened to me a few years ago and I'm just burned."
"1539300","1540980"," So now you have a beard guy that you go to."
"1541140","1542680"," Got a beard guy in Hoboken. "
"1542940","1546880"," It cost me an extra $34 a month but it makes me tight."
"1547660","1550360"," Long 447 C's here."
"1550560","1552240"," Well the biggest issue is when you're growing it back. "
"1552440","1553300"," It looks kind of ugly."
"1553460","1555180"," It's not really a good length at least for me."
"1555300","1558800"," So let's just let's just agree right here you're just going to go without a beard going forward. "
"1558800","1559160"," Me?"
"1559380","1559600"," No."
"1559700","1560160"," Oh Matt."
"1560340","1560580"," Yeah. "
"1560780","1562000"," I don't think so."
"1562420","1563300"," Right in here."
"1563640","1565740"," As you mentioned all eyes were on Nvidia. "
"1565900","1567380"," Right now I'm 3.7 percent."
"1567720","1568840"," Not a massive gain."
"1569040","1574560"," One is up closer to six and a half percent this morning but still $37 billion in market value being"
"1574560","1574860"," added. "
"1575340","1577620"," Semi-conductor index though is flat on the day."
"1578040","1582020"," When you're looking at some of those outperformers and underperformers though on the S&P 500."
"1582760","1585880"," Horse performing stock this morning Dollar Tree down 10 percent. "
"1586520","1593160"," Week there are 3Q profit views, soft margins disappointing on the upside though Autodesk to their"
"1593160","1597980"," ADSK rallying right now 3.5 percent after positive results in a forecast."
"1598400","1603840"," So while all eyes were on Nvidia guys we did have results from Dollar Tree Autodesk."
"1604440","1606380"," We have an update from Boeing. "
"1608860","1614170"," $35 million valuing hugging face."
"1620570","1625160"," One quick second I look"
"1627690","1641920"," at a retail sales this"
"1641920","1644660"," morning came in kind of mixed but still positive."
"1645200","1645760"," Here we go. "
"1645760","1649880"," We saw industrial production manufacturing on the manufacturing side up fairly strongly."
"1650600","1653200"," What does that tell you about where the economy is?"
"1653200","1655300"," This is the live interviewing about it."
"1655480","1658680"," It's enough to slow things down and bring inflation lower. "
"1658780","1663520"," Well my take is that demand is cooling but it's not yet cold and I think that's what you saw."
"1664280","1665480"," Trapped there was a fan extension."
"1665580","1671080"," On all of the demand metrics in January but February, March, April I think they're coming in much"
"1671080","1677500"," more flatish net of inflation for example in retail sales than they are and I think that's just a"
"1677500","1685100"," sign that the combination of all these things rate hikes, eroding consumer savings, meaning fiscal"
"1685100","1689220"," stimulus are all affecting demand in the way that you would think. "
"1689520","1693440"," Well we've come down from 9 percent inflation to around 5 percent."
"1693940","1696270"," The low hanging fruit has been updated."
"1696390","1697690"," That's my fucking position here. "
"1697690","1701130"," Do you think you need more restraint in order to get down?"
"1701290","1705270"," I'm like you get to get out of this right now towards your two percent target."
"1705750","1711390"," Well there's a plausible story there that combines the things I was just talking about and add you"
"1711390","1716150"," know credit tightening to say they're going to bring demand down and in time bring inflation down."
"1716270","1717470"," I think that's a plausible story. "
"1717930","1720230"," I'll just say for me I'm still looking to be convinced."
"1720550","1721830"," I still think about this bar right here."
"1723790","1727270"," The more you're looking for a the aircraft is coming down right now. "
"1727290","1734550"," We're sort of operating at a I'm still looking to be convinced that demand will come down and then"
"1734550","1736150"," of course that that will bring inflation down."
"1736150","1738410"," We should keep the strong restrictive for a while."
"1739490","1742550"," I'm going to mute this guy in the background here. "
"1744470","1746770"," This is Barkin speaking right now by the way."
"1746850","1752450"," June meeting leaning towards a rate increase or do you want to pause see what happens and start"
"1752450","1754990"," again even though some people said you don't want that stop start."
"1755450","1760330"," Well I like the optionality that was implied in them and the memorandum that we did the statement"
"1760330","1762070"," we did after the last meeting. "
"1762310","1767530"," Obviously in this period even this month we're going to have a full month's worth of data coming."
"1767830","1771390"," You've got questions about the debt ceiling and what impact that might have."
"1771630","1773890"," You've got questions about still long here. "
"1773990","1776650"," I'm not going to try to get out unless you get a green bar up here."
"1783190","1783630"," You've"
"1783630","1797770"," got"
"1797770","1798890"," some big banks in your district."
"1799990","1803550"," When the Fed raises rates banks always tighten credit standards. "
"1803550","1805250"," Loan demand goes down."
"1805530","1809510"," So the question is are you seeing anything or are they telling you they're seeing anything because"
"1809510","1815390"," of the bank issues we had in March that is worse than what normally would be expected."
"1816270","1819090"," So about some calls right here wasn't paying attention. "
"1819370","1821070"," Was trying to get barking on YouTube."
"1821670","1823510"," Didn't even see this role here."
"1826150","1827110"," Down big. "
"1827670","1833490"," I just grabbed some more calls to try to you get out of the trade up here."
"1833490","1837530"," So you're in a situation where it deposits a re-pricing."
"1838150","1842290"," That does mean they're going to look at the marginal credit a little bit tighter and that could be"
"1842290","1843670"," the marginal consumer credit. "
"1843670","1849630"," Certainly commercial real estate folks are telling me that credit's hard to get in that sector."
"1850230","1855050"," Small businesses and then the only other thing you hear you hear this particularly with the smaller"
"1855050","1862570"," banks is they do worry about margin in the context of deposits being a place of so much attention"
"1862570","1864350"," and obviously re-pricing."
"1864670","1866370"," What about commercial real estate. "
"1867330","1872130"," There's a feeling that that could be the weak point for lenders this cycle."
"1873090","1875490"," Are they for 48-04?"
"1876570","1878050"," Do they get the warning up here?"
"1879170","1883950"," Well commercial real estate is a big sector and so if you're in industrial or you're in retail or"
"1883950","1888250"," you're in multifamily I think folks there feel the normal every day."
"1888690","1890030"," That's just big right here. "
"1890870","1897010"," But if you go to commercial office particularly downtown commercial office particularly B&C"
"1897010","1901990"," downtown commercial office particularly in cities like Washington where people are not back to work"
"1901990","1908730"," that's where you hear the most concern and I think folks are concerned until occupancy rates get"
"1908730","1912850"," back to where they were beforehand I think they do worry about valuations."
"1913250","1916970"," Right here big old trap right here I got trapped right at this right here."
"1917330","1923170"," Sierra issues could do to the economy or is it just kind of something at this point that is in"
"1923170","1923450"," the mix. "
"1924090","1928350"," Oh I'm watching that closely and I think that is a vulnerability now it's not an unknown"
"1928350","1929270"," vulnerability."
"1930030","1934210"," We've seen commercial real estate challenges before we know how that plays out we know what to"
"1934210","1939430"," track what to monitor and we know that that happens over time not in a big fell swoop but it's"
"1939430","1941170"," certainly a vulnerability that I'm focusing on."
"1941630","1945810"," Unemployment is not behaving as the fed forecast it would. "
"1946010","1952350"," How are you thinking about that now when you go into June and you do a new projection are you"
"1952350","1956830"," still going to see unemployment employment at four and a half percent or do you think it comes"
"1956830","1957190"," down."
"1957910","1963710"," Well the job market 3.4 percent unemployment it maybe we're no longer red hot but we're certainly"
"1963710","1970410"," hot and some of the secondary indicators may be softening quits claims but you know the"
"1970410","1976790"," unemployment rate is still a critical variable here and it's still it's still quite hot so that's"
"1976790","1980770"," how I see it and and therefore it has not softened as much as I would have imagined three months"
"1980770","1987750"," ago so I'd imagine my forecast will come down a little bit buying another 10 pack here segment"
"1987750","1993250"," because if you look at the layoff notices over the last six months they buy in large got caught"
"1993250","1994530"," right in this right here."
"1995090","1999230"," Wasn't even paying attention just sitting here or even frontline service about that one right"
"1999230","1999510"," there. "
"1999610","2002310"," Boom that bar right there caught me."
"2009480","2011620"," What's going on here this thing doesn't want to."
"2020020","2021000"," They're still tight. "
"2021460","2026340"," They've been much more support and overhead technology kind of layoffs and the unemployment rate in"
"2026340","2032040"," that group is quite low the propensity to file for unemployment is quite low so one thing I'm"
"2032040","2037220"," playing around with is the idea that maybe unemployment won't spike as much as normal because the"
"2037220","2042700"," folks who are being displaced are folks with less propensity to unemployment and a faster ability"
"2042700","2043260"," to repot."
"2043580","2048639"," Well what are CEOs telling you in your district about their labor plans are they hoarding people"
"2048639","2053199"," because they're hard to find or do they think maybe we aren't going to go into recessions so"
"2053199","2054760"," there's not a need to let people go."
"2055639","2061159"," Most of the folks I talk to do anticipate some sort of a downturn coming over the next few quarters"
"2061159","2067780"," they've got the recession playbook out and they're working it but when it comes to downsizing I"
"2067780","2071320"," think they're quite cautious and for this it's exactly the reason you talked about they fought"
"2071320","2077080"," tooth and nail for 18 months to try to find workers and hold workers and retain workers they're"
"2077080","2078800"," just reluctant to let them go. "
"2078800","2084760"," That's particularly true I think in frontline service workers made a lot of construction places"
"2084760","2089300"," where they're just concerned there's an overall shortage and they just don't want to have to go"
"2089300","2090900"," back to where they were 18 months ago."
"2091219","2095320"," Are they still paying more to attract workers or is that trend starting to slow?"
"2111650","2120350"," I'm in straight salvage mode here like straight up salvage mode bad here this is all bearish here"
"2120350","2128030"," all this bearish here I'm buying it just bought another fucking 25 down here by nine cents down"
"2128030","2136330"," here I caught it like 27 up here 66% of the trade gone right in here just in that"
"2136330","2145170"," trade right there I'm a fucking bag holder hate being a bag holder in zero dates not paying"
"2145170","2151130"," attention trying what what's going on with this thing here for that one second here guys still"
"2151130","2156970"," elevated still high but absolutely the year of a year rate of increase is coming down and it turns"
"2156970","2163190"," some of this software to hot 18 months ago there was desperation you really couldn't get the second"
"2163190","2168570"," here now folks are getting the job maybe that's working better just a question of vacancies or and"
"2168570","2174510"," all that nutrition rates are down and so I think the pressure on compensation is down what about on"
"2174510","2180830"," the price side are people finding a limit to their ability to raise prices or do we still see that"
"2180830","2188230"," trend continue yeah 360 is plenty if there is a recession two or three quarters down they're not"
"2188230","2193310"," going to have the pricing power that they had last year but they're not going to give it up without"
"2193310","2196630"," being forced to give it up and if you look at a lot of the earnings reports over the first"
"2196630","2202370"," quarter particularly in consumer goods you saw a lot of companies with prices up tend to sellers"
"2202370","2208990"," it's like perfect right here perfect I wasn't even watching mall like angry at myself now for not"
"2208990","2215090"," paying attention so you can see when you're not paying attention what happens here you didn't get"
"2215090","2220270"," caught up so I'm sitting here watching this right now uh five minutes where price increases have"
"2220270","2223970"," stopped or stalled but there are a lot of places where they're continuing and that's what's behind"
"2223970","2230030"," the elevated inflation we're seeing today huge reversal sign right here the economy is this soft"
"2230030","2235290"," way to see this right here in a five-minute chart right there you said most people huge reversal"
"2235290","2239770"," coming up i'm going to like they have to i'm going to likely get stopped out here in just a"
"2239770","2245210"," moment if there's any kind of a breakthrough this here matter of"
"2245210","2254830"," fact hold on here it may take more now when you say you're looking to be convinced um"
"2254830","2261710"," do you think it's a good idea to stop for a while and then start again because that sends mixed"

"5167970","5177530"," trigger so just right here previous examples of dips being bought saying"
"5177530","5186830"," that i'm not trusting this is the place to buy a dip you can see this red candle here is"
"5186830","5193990"," being the attempt is to buy this right now saying that though i don't like the uh hourly velocity"
"5193990","5200230"," here so let's take a look at our level of bellow i want you to see this here so this"
"5200230","5206530"," bellow has not turned around so we're still making new lows on bellow and i want you to see this"
"5206530","5215350"," here i'm not sold on this being the last candle down here and just this right here look at these"
"5215350","5225390"," two right here like this one's just getting started i'm not seeing uh higher higher lows on half"
"5225390","5231990"," our bellow and just watching hourly bellow still got more it can go down here so i'm not seeing"
"5231990","5236890"," like a higher green bar or yellow bar green bar here so i'm not seeing a bar like up here"
"5236890","5243910"," showing this is bottom so until i start to see this kind of stuff here and higher bars in here"
"5243910","5250750"," not sold or convinced in any way shape or form uh that we're done going down but classically"
"5250750","5256990"," traditionally you'd be buying this and you'd be ripping up higher here watching all this stuff roll"
"5256990","5266830"," over above here this isn't good so not not a buyer down here of going"
"5266830","5276740"," long on not not a fan of this this zone right here i'm like yeah"
"5276740","5282340"," i don't buy this at all i think there's more down to go so we'll keep our eyes here there's"
"5282340","5286120"," that yellow bar here's the white one now right up here we'll see if there's a place to sell right"
"5286120","5292880"," above see if there's a squeeze up here and then more continuation of the downside here i'm assuming"
"5292880","5300520"," jump on this one finally missed a one big trade took two two great trades to the downside now"

"9074700","9084140"," there i know it's not up here anymore but just keep your eyes right here in this next it's like"
"9084140","9094040"," 20 minutes but keep your eyes just in here the half-hour candle look"
"9094040","9102220"," to find out if there's rejection here in the half-hour so that 1230ish 1230 go on there"
"9102220","9117410"," right around 1230 right up in here like right here let's"
"9117410","9125290"," see what happens on that uh on that break up in here here's the trigger screen here's the big green"

"9149590","9167760"," little v-shape recovery here uh"
"9176310","9182850"," it doesn't mean anything uh what was the we're talking about the rejection 445 and talking about it"
"9182850","9191190"," doesn't mean anything uh no meaning right now the only thing i'm looking for is 450 i'm looking for"
"9191190","9199830"," a rejection at 450 i'm assuming that the rejection at 445 is has more to do with uh the implied"
"9199830","9208150"," move on NVDA that's my that's that that's the idea there uh the only other thing that the thing"
"9208150","9216790"," that concerns anymore is uh DXY the dollar um it's i'm just concerned with that but i think we"
"9216790","9225510"," trade 450 still no it's it has more to like NVDA so it doesn't have anything to do with i"
"9225510","9235230"," should have stayed in those 441s uh no no real conviction uh which i"
"9235230","9241430"," my view is that we trade that 445 450 and then uh we roll it down and hit that weekly"
"9241430","9250670"," trigger that 420 427 then find out what's going on the big the big key here is uh the big"
"9250670","9257190"," key here is do we get above 450 like that's the one like that's the we get above 450 here"
"9257190","9265790"," let's talk about um let's look at a chart here like nothing's changed even from yesterday i drew"
"9265790","9270570"," that big line saying you'd have a low and today and stuff get the high up there we actually got"
"9270570","9276050"," extra high from NVDA and now we're down here again we said i think we said 11 a.m to"
"9276050","9280590"," have a low in the market or 10 a.m but it's now what time yeah it's 12 o'clock"
"9280590","9290670"," it's two hours later and it's still pretty good and"
"9290670","9295430"," we're going to talk about Jerome Powell for tomorrow what to expect from him we talked about it"
"9295430","9303390"," yesterday and uh we should get up here and trade this right here we should trade this 440 38 i"
"9303390","9314970"," think i said 440 38 i think that's what i said put that up there real quick 440"
"9314970","9324170"," 38 wherever that is you'll then see us come down here and consolidate"
"9324170","9335040"," or should should be something like this gonna"
"9335040","9344810"," bounce back down this kind of garbage uh"
"9344810","9351330"," what's my take on spoons still going high it's not done and i think that or not think that but"
"9351330","9357190"," i want you to realize that the what's two things to realize about Jerome number one the vol comes"
"9357190","9366290"," off the market once he's done speaking tomorrow number two is uh what do you expect from Jerome to"
"9366290","9373030"," say so i'm gonna fucking stay in those calls man trading 47 cents"
"9373030","9382890"," right now so um four or sorry so"
"9382890","9388690"," Jerome Powell right we've got the vault with number one if you're long the market you are hedged"
"9388690","9396510"," into Jerome Powell's speech it's the most logical thing that you do right the next point would be"
"9396510","9403690"," the next point would be trading 440 28 so you're gonna"
"9403690","9413110"," take some like nine out of ten times trading 440"
"9413110","9422970"," 32 433 so Jerome Powell right you've got the volatility of"
"9422970","9428770"," that event you're going to get a volatility crush off that event the next question regardless"
"9428770","9433430"," you're going to get a volatility crush it's like all that hedging comes off you might still be"
"9433430","9439590"," bearish but all those other puts get pulled off unless something negative is said hawkish is said"
"9439590","9447350"," from Jerome Powell now this morning early morning i've been listening to um the new york radio"
"9447350","9454010"," station trying to get all these interviewers and what their take is on tomorrow and it's kind of"
"9454010","9462190"," funny to listen to some of these people there's like a um trading 440 33 right now 430 36 right"
"9462190","9473350"," now 37 38 42 40 right there we'll see"
"9473350","9487540"," if we break above and trade all the way up here and"
"9487540","9497540"," get rid of this one now hit the target and why are we looking at that right i don't"
"9497540","9502220"," know if you guys are paying attention but we're looking at that because of this half-hour bar right"
"9502220","9510360"," here right i want to show you this it's all bear wants right it's to break trend right so this"
"9510360","9520300"," is trend bye bye bye woohoo come down here and what do we"
"9520300","9526460"," say earlier yeah i don't buy this probably gonna fail right what did it do it failed right broke"
"9526460","9534280"," right through now we did buy this whole move here so what do you do as a bull here is"
"9534280","9540760"," you don't do shit right you don't you don't own anything here why do you don't you own anything"
"9540760","9546800"," here and you don't own anything here actually we tagged it almost perfectly right look at green bar"
"9546800","9553780"," up there right why don't we buy this right here or why don't we stay long on calls right here"
"9553780","9562800"," because you want to wait to see if we can get above and get a reversal right here okay so"
"9562800","9569360"," this is the no-go zone for you right so if you're going to have a no-go zone and"
"9569360","9579140"," where would be a go zone it's going to be above uh 440 69 somewhere in there"
"9579140","9585060"," that says here this is 440 69 but i'm not a believer in that so i'm going to go against"
"9585060","9592180"," that right now because these aren't but these aren't exactly uh EMA's on this so just watching here"
"9592180","9600520"," hold on here just watching here if you're a bull we'll pay attention if you're a bull so if you're"
"9600520","9606020"," a bull what you're looking for here is if you what if you're like hey cap is this over we're"
"9606020","9616770"," done going down you are going to be looking for this to hold see this"
"9616770","9626810"," right here you want that to hold you want to see green bars hold on here you want"
"9626810","9634130"," to see green bars take us up here come back down and then squeeze this up come back down come"
"9634130","9642410"," back down and then have a continuation are you can't get bullish here i'm going to warn you you"
"9642410","9648250"," can't get bullish none of this is bullish here all this is is squeezing bullshit as we've said"
"9648250","9656670"," before i said it yesterday i don't know 10 times or something maybe 30 times something like that we"
"9656670","9662150"," know that the hourly trigger we know the hourly trigger is below the daily trigger we know that"
"9662150","9670550"," price has to test above the hourly trigger right daily trigger hourly trigger price needs to"
"9670550","9678750"," be above both test both and continue higher to get bullish right we knew this morning that"
"9678750","9685960"," well the hourly trigger was down here but actually find out where it is right now 45"
"9687400","9697290"," so it's now come down even lower it's now down by the by"
"9697290","9702710"," the trigger down here hold on let me get rid of that because in the fucking way hourly trigger is"
"9702710","9712710"," now down here there's the pivot right and you're like hey cap i'm bullish here right so this"
"9712710","9719390"," hourly trigger is now negative okay or was negative negative earlier but it is negative right so"
"9719390","9727270"," because it's negative you got you got crazy sellers here right you got sellers above here you got"
"9727270","9735670"," seller known sellers here on trend you've got sellers here at 440 89 and sellers above here at 442"
"9735670","9743030"," 38 or something you got the intraday pivot wherever we're below the intraday pivot that's negative"
"9743030","9750690"," right so you got a bunch of negativity down here bulls have a ton of work here to do now"
"9750690","9757290"," let's talk about let's talk about Jerome here for a second get back into the Jerome conversation"
"9757290","9764150"," now we know we'll have a ball cross heading into tomorrow unless he says something super hawkish"

"9784290","9792410"," say what people want to hear they do they have a um do they have a but an agenda and"
"9792410","9797310"," it was fascinating because some of these people you could tell had an agenda you knew they were"

"9802370","9806990"," guy is out of his fucking mind right now what he's saying but you know that it's more he's probably"
"9806990","9811450"," this one guy this war was probably talking uh this one guy was probably talking because he was"
"9811450","9818670"," upside down in nvda his firm likely was and you can't like we talk about implied moves right like"
"9818670","9824910"," you get the upside implied move the downside implied move unless you have something unknown from"
"9824910","9829530"," your earnings if you're a good or if you have a if you have like meat expectation earnings on a"
"9829530","9839470"," on a company like Nvidia Tesla it's not good enough you can't trade up into their earnings have a"
"9839470","9845530"," good earnings but nothing unknown and no buybacks aren't good enough that doesn't that's it doesn't"
"9845530","9853430"," work you like stock split or some some unknown news so you see the huge move up in nvda and"
"9853430","9859170"," the overnight held into the open today you're going to expect it to come back down or in a minimum"
"9859170","9866730"," in a minimum erase all that move so you saw that erase erasing of that move today in nvda so"
"9866730","9874390"," bears here just right here let's see if i can get this for you here bears here are looking to"
"9874390","9882630"," stay underneath and they're not doing it right now are they look at them they're losing they're"
"9882630","9889990"," losing the downside here watch my cursor down below so they want to get that closing bar let me"
"9889990","9894550"," show that third out of 30 minute i guess they're not losing they still have it in the 30 minute"
"9894550","9903880"," bar i'm lying i'm gonna get rid of this so you can see it more clearly now just watch this"
"9903880","9911610"," yellow line right here this is the important line right here they don't want to give this up here"
"9911610","9918790"," because we'll be back on trend right next 30 minute bar they don't want to see that up here do"
"9918790","9928030"," they don't want to see a 30 minute bar in here they want that big reversal candle like blood red"
"9928030","9936710"," huge reversal candle to the downside like straight bloodbath is what they're looking for so saying"
"9936710","9943230"," that something's down the bottom down here so saying that they want to see you know big reversal"
"9943230","9948430"," here right big giant reversal candle bloodbath in here is what they're looking for they're trying"
"9948430","9958370"," to sell that right there right now now the event ball comes off tomorrow right all that event ball"
"9958370","9967770"," comes off tomorrow and though the conversation that we had yesterday was about how does Jerome act"
"9969550","9978670"," at uh at um Jackson's hole it's a possessive s by the way on the thumbnail"
"9978670","9985290"," so the question becomes how like how does he act at Jackson hole and i was quite shocked this"
"9985290","9991470"," morning because i could tell who was lying and who was telling the truth even the most hawkish"
"9991470","9999610"," people that were telling the truth had a pretty fair estimate as to what to expect tomorrow from"
"9999610","10004530"," Jerome then there were like the clowns that come out and the clowns that come out are saying just"
"10004530","10013110"," all kinds of nonsense now let's talk about his previous rate decisions and they're a good bell"
"10013110","10020210"," weather they're a good bell weather uh they're a good bell weather in terms of move that over for"
"10020210","10027430"," you so you can see it they're a good bell weather in terms of uh what to expect from him"
"10027430","10033790"," and if you watch those if you are like me or most of the people that watch the show we"
"10033790","10040210"," pay attention to what Jerome says and you know that i'm pretty clear and pretty good on reading"
"10040210","10049150"," what he's saying and the nuance in what he's saying one of the things that i'm good at is like"
"10049150","10054030"," interpreting what somebody's saying i might not tell you if i know you personally that i know what"
"10054030","10061010"," you're saying i might not acknowledge that but that's different now with this kind of stuff i'm"
"10061010","10068390"," pretty good at it like better than good so that's like one small thing in my like forget ego and"
"10068390","10073230"," stuff like this is something i'm actually good at uh most of my profession what most of the way i"
"10073230","10082590"," did my my job and my life was focused around that kind of stuff uh so Jerome has slowly"
"10082590","10092470"," crafted and changed uh his stance to you know like this harsh uh hawkishness"
"10092470","10101930"," harshness that started in late 2021 middle 2021 and got really like ramped up"
"10101930","10112910"," hawkish uh into 2022 and slowly as we got into 2023 he's"
"10112910","10122810"," uh become more neutral than even cracks and signs of uh of douvishness now"
"10124230","10130870"," as we get closer into next year i'm going to expect that same thing to happen so if you've got"
"10130870","10143160"," you got to hold on here if you have a meter here here's"
"10143160","10148020"," those sellers in here you see that these guys coming in here right now these little sneaky peeps"
"10148020","10155780"," 1228 in the morning right half an hour they want this half hour bar real bad right these sellers"
"10155780","10161960"," want this half hour bar uh real bad like real real bad if you're a seller right now watching this"
"10161960","10171040"," i assure you that they are they want this this huge huge half hour candle to the downside like"
"10171040","10180700"," bloodbath right here so just talking about Jerome if you are if you're like a clear "
"10180700","10190260","-minded person objective person right why do you like think about this"
"10190260","10199360"," idea this concept that like like we got like a super hawk over here right he's a big h"
"10199360","10209300"," and we got dove over here you know his biggest hawkish days were a long time ago"
"10209300","10217540"," i'm sorry to say that to you he became less and less hawkish and even more recently"
"10217540","10227140"," he's kind of like this is like a zero line right here like this is"
"10227140","10234280"," zero he took a victory lap this last time so like this like he's at a one right now it's"
"10234280","10243440"," like a 10 over here he's at a one right now not quite not quite dovish but not quite uh"
"10243440","10250440"," not quite like middle of the road either it took a pretty big victory lap uh this last rate"
"10250440","10259920"," decision and his language has changed and further to that point further to that point uh he took"
"10259920","10268360"," almost like a victory lap he actually pissed off he actually pissed off the the reporters"
"10268360","10276200"," because they're looking for juice like the reporters in that audience that day we're looking for"
"10276200","10282980"," juice they wanted like a juicy statement they've tried to pry him and pry him to have to bring out"
"10282980","10289560"," like bear pow right they wanted to bring out the ask the trigger questions and trigger him to turn"
"10289560","10296920"," into a super hawk which they were able to do maybe like four or five sessions before even if he"
"10296920","10304880"," was getting more more posish you could trigger him into being a bear pow and that did not happen uh"
"10304880","10312580"," the last two or three rate decisions and more specifically the most recent rate decision he"
"10312580","10319880"," wouldn't even entertain uh answering those questions and so i'm going to expect more of the same of"
"10319880","10329620"," that tomorrow from bear pow or from drum powell or mr powell or president powell he could probably"
"10329620","10334680"," run for president couldn't he like jamie diamond claims he could be president i bet you drum could"
"10334680","10339220"," you know some of you would have disagreed with that but i i guarantee you probably could and"
"10339220","10345200"," probably have a pretty good run and bring on yeah old yellen but he'd lose the ticket because of"
"10345200","10355440"," her being there old yeller should be out there screaming it's"
"10355440","10364040"," like that they'll be quiet about that so but you're not going to expect to roam to come out like"
"10364040","10368300"," some people are like one guy listening to this more it's like oh it's super hawk tomorrow and i'm"
"10368300","10374520"," like i don't think so uh he usually usually at these things if he's already hawkish you get hawker"
"10374520","10379180"," bear or you get hawker powell uh when he was when he was on that meter that i showed you"
"10379180","10388960"," when he was being hawkish he was hawkish at um at jackson's"
"10388960","10396220"," pole so i'm going to expect him to be more in line with what his rate decision was so i"
"10396220","10406970"," don't think you get maybe maybe you get some comment on we have more work to do uh"
"10406970","10414990"," that was the conversation yesterday was he has to make the market believe and make people believe"
"10415810","10423770"," that he's going to pause and hire for longer even though we know that he's not and the reason why"
"10423770","10428390"," does he have to do that or i guess if you're a bull listening right now feel like a market"
"10428390","10435370"," bull listening right now do you know why uh do you know why he has to say that and the"
"10435370","10441230"," reason he has to say that is uh for for the market to continue higher now bulls don't want to"
"10441230","10446410"," hear that they don't want to hear that uh it's it's pausing and maybe higher for longer like we"
"10446410","10453690"," we're pausing we're not going to cut and there's a looming threat of of um rate hikes in the future"
"10453690","10461570"," even though they're not there the more he talks like pause and rate cuts the more bearish it is"
"10461570","10466770"," believe it or not i know you don't believe that you know that like 50 percent of you don't believe"
"10466770","10470170"," that there's i got bears out there that believe a rate cuts are going to make the market squeeze"
"10470170","10478190"," are maybe briefly but it should roll over uh been a big way now your room here has a we're"
"10478190","10483950"," he's in a really weird place he's done a ton of damage to the economy forget the numbers from this"
"10483950","10488550"," morning he's got the dual mandate and that kind of stuff but he's got good numbers this morning"
"10488550","10493190"," right that's gonna like that's gonna like say hey look i'm doing my job and i got great jobs out"
"10493190","10499550"," there everything is honky-dory even though we know that it's not we know that it's not honky-dory"
"10499550","10504590"," out there we know there's actual damage being done out there we had a long conversation yesterday"
"10504590","10512270"," about realtors and buyers and sellers we had long conversations about employment uh wage we already"
"10512270","10519790"," know that wage uh matter of fact another another story broke this morning about um about wage"
"10519790","10526690"," inflation and you know we we talked about that last week or the week before on this program and the"
"10526690","10531870"," week before that and the week before that when it came to FedEx and UPS and the UAW i think"
"10531870","10536470"," for four weeks we've been talking about the unions and what they're asking for so you guys already"
"10536470","10542870"," know all this shit we've been talking about this before it even happens right um so the key point"
"10542870","10548650"," here though is this that Jerome is coming into the end of his hiking cycle and the moment that it's"
"10548650","10557270"," believed believed that he's gonna cut rates we should get a market role and where does he want that"
"10557270","10562430"," role uh you have to think from his perspective where does he want that role because he want that"
"10562430","10572210"," role at uh 439 or 426 or 23 i think i think there's sellers out there that believe that"
"10572210","10577290"," they're out of their fucking minds i'm gonna tell you right now they're out of their fucking minds"
"10577290","10583710"," if they think that's real they're truly out of their minds uh they're smoking crack if you're a"
"10583710","10593090"," seller here thinking that that's really what he wants to do you're out of your mind so he wants he"
"10593090","10599650"," knows it's gonna sell so it's gonna sell from where he wants it to sell not from what you think"
"10599650","10609570"," he's gonna do at uh at fucking Jackson's hole it's gonna happen down the road and it's"
"10609570","10616310"," gonna happen at a price that he feels comfortable with if he's trying to sell or he knows he's"
"10616310","10622810"," gonna sell the market he's gonna want to sell it at 47 or 4800 and it's gonna be on his"
"10622810","10629550"," terms or get front run it's not gonna get front run at 456 i apologize i already made this video"
"10629550","10636010"," man like four weeks ago i told you before mike barry came out to expect mike barry to come out"
"10636010","10641590"," i said you're gonna expect the mike barry's to come out you're gonna expect all these big time long "
"10641590","10648170","-term bears to come out and tell you that this is the top and you're gonna hear him say it"
"10648170","10654570"," three or four times you're gonna hear him say it as we get up to uh the previous high you're"
"10654570","10660890"," gonna hear him come out and say it again when we trade 472 and 480 all he has to do"
"10660890","10669070"," and guys like him that guy right there right can come out and say it uh as we approach all "
"10669070","10675730","-time highs three or four times and even when we roll up there you'll remember him as being the top"
"10675730","10682850"," caller which is still bullshit because we all know it i know it you know it everybody else knew it"
"10682850","10687830"," before it even happened and in that fucking video that next day he came out there like nine in the"
"10687830","10696330"," morning and sure enough said something so it was like kind of hilarious to uh to have him out there"
"10696330","10702750"," coming out because it's so it's so stupid it's like it's like it's like you consider this guy the"
"10702750","10707910"," smartest guy in the world and yet uh we know what's coming before it even happens right so he's not"
"10707910","10713990"," that much of a rocket scientist like you think right so you'll just look back in six months and say"
"10713990","10718750"," oh look he called it four times as we approached all-time highs and look we got the roll at"
"10718750","10723990"," 480 took a few times but that guy's a rocket scientist we already know this stuff before it even"
"10723990","10731450"," happens now do i think that uh mike barry's gonna beat uh Jerome paul with this happening fuck no"
"10732410","10739630"," fuck no mike barry doesn't have shit on Jerome paul i'm sorry no offense to you out there but he"
"10739630","10746310"," doesn't so you're gonna get these people these powerful people uh that when they know it's going to"
"10746310","10754150"," happen they're gonna try to be doing it at like 40-100 why why right is the big question why"
"10754150","10760610"," cap why is it 48 or 4700 why is it there cap and i'm gonna tell you why the reason"
"10760610","10766330"," being is oh man look at this they're gonna try to rip the fuck out of this v-shape recovery"
"10766330","10775550"," so why is that it's because they don't want to sell this market at 43 to 42 30 they want"
"10775550","10781890"," to sell it at 48 to give them the buffer that they need so when the market rolls like seriously"
"10781890","10789110"," truly rolls but they have buffer they don't want to go they can go from 48 down to 3500 they"
"10789110","10799070"," can go to 36 38 42 4000 and they have some safety they've got a buffer everyone's happy you"
"10799070","10804830"," can say oh look at that we had our we had our recession crash oh it's oh crying over here"
"10804830","10812070"," it was terrible you know and you're and all you're doing is coming back down to retest that low at"
"10812070","10820390"," 3500 at worst case scenario some of you out there think that Jerome wants to fucking sell the"
"10820390","10828570"," market at 4200 start the process of rate cuts in the roll right now and that that that Jerome wants"
"10828570","10837690"," to trade 2600 or 1600 or some stupid low like 28 or 32 he doesn't want to do that"
"10837690","10845690"," why does he not want to do that because he doesn't want the risk associated with trading that and"
"10845690","10855690"," not having that downside buffer creating an actual crash creating an actual crash where it get"
"10855690","10863010"," where the selling gets out of control it trades down to 26 1600 something stupid like that if he's"
"10863010","10870310"," doing it at 4800 he's like I got 1300 points I can I can spit it out to get what"
"10870310","10879590"," I'm saying now I'm not saying that Jerome is right in this I'm not saying to you that Jerome is"
"10879590","10886050"," going to be correct in this what I am going to tell you is that these fucking people think they"

"11076610","11083730"," you need people to believe that you need people to believe that rate cuts are coming uh situation"
"11083730","11091630"," solved you're not gonna get that with Jerome being hawkish the more dumbish he becomes heading into"
"11091630","11098470"," this new year is when you actually create the trap for bag holders you know what i'm saying you"
"11098470","11104230"," gotta make these people believe this stuff so kid you're not like you have to create these people"
"11104230","11109530"," so i want you to know that i want you to know that into the spring time and then what"
"11109530","11116210"," you know you start to get the the dovish to roam right the dovish to roam and this is the"
"11116210","11125150"," one that tricks the basically the stupid people the stupid people on main street they get tricked"
"11125150","11131590"," then they roll this thing down it happens every single time now get covid out of the way in this"
"11131590","11138690"," but normal mark it up and downs like normal corrections normal normal crashes that's how it happens"
"11138690","11145350"," it's never on a low we're still on a low we're still not on a high you know what i'm"
"11145350","11151630"," saying you want it you want exuberance from these people there was no exuberance heading up into uh"
"11151630","11159690"," 456 you need exuberance you need oh yeah this is over everything is great until you get that you're"
"11159690","11164270"," not getting your you're not getting it and so my point to you would be if you are bear looking"
"11164270","11172770"," for that uh it's likely going to be much higher and i would limit your downside expectations if"
"11172770","11179230"," you're that person that's like yeah it's gonna be okay cap i'm with you on the 4800 or the 4700"
"11179230","11186870"," i'm still bearish here if you're looking for that moment of the fraudulent market like 2008 you"
"11186870","11193170"," might get it but you can't trade that you can't have that conviction there's nothing saying that we"
"11193170","11200070"," haven't even broken trend yet for that to happen you haven't broken upside trend yet we're still on"
"11200070","11207570"," the upside channel going up there's nothing technically saying that you're right nothing right"
"11207570","11212530"," nothing tech nothing technically in this market saying you're right there's some stuff saying you"
"11212530","11220130"," could be right dixie man dixie is like ugliest sin but even so if dixie squeezes brings us down to"
"11220130","11225890"," 426 and then dixie gets sold down to the depths of hell it's a lot of room right dixie gets"
"11225890","11234390"," up to 106 107 we're only trading 427 here we go there's the there's the new run to the upside"
"11234390","11242390"," so i would be very weary you're trying to fight a guy out there that doesn't want you to get"
"11242390","11250350"," that 2600 or 1600 that doom and gloom that you consume that you're reading that you're you're"
"11250350","11259570"," fucking shoving down your throat all day long he's fighting it can you think he's going to be on"
"11259570","11263810"," your side he's not going to be on your side they're going to try to fight it the entire way"
"11263810","11270710"," now does it can it happen sure uh i would be trading it from from level to level if it"
"11270710","11276790"," happens if you get that fraud trade uh but i don't think you get it i don't think you get"
"11276790","11281770"," it um i don't think you get it like willingly i don't think i don't think you get it willingly"
"11282850","11285790"," so i think you get it i don't think you get it from here i think you get it from"
"11285790","11292070"," higher up and that is uh that is like a story as old as time it happens in uh on"
"11292070","11298770"," a one-minute chart a five-minute chart uh happens all the time on a fucking hourly chart you don't"
"11298770","11304910"," quite get what you want it's like a line you should write down on your trading journal you're not"
"11304910","11312710"," quite getting what you think you're getting you know and sometimes you do sometimes you actually do"
"11312710","11319450"," 2008 we got it right uh but that is like that's not something that you trade it's not something you"
"11319450","11330750"," plan on mike berry planned on that right he missed hundreds of millions of dollars hundreds for"
"11330750","11341190"," years seven years like seven long years of seven long years of him just losing and"
"11341190","11347670"," then had to take more money just to break even dca dca that's what he was doing he was fucking"
"11347670","11357210"," dca and so eventually he was right so you can't trade it you and i your retail you can't trade"
"11357210","11365970"," that you have to believe that geroam is not going to give that satisfaction to you tomorrow you"
"11365970","11373310"," have to believe that geroam is not going to be talking this market down from four twenty seven or"
"11373310","11383240"," even four what was the low this week uh you think at four thirty three you think down"
"11383240","11389180"," here he's going to talk this market down you're out of your fucking mind you're out of your you're"
"11389180","11397840"," out of your mind so right where we are today right here where we are right here right right"
"11397840","11407500"," do you think he's going to talk this market down tomorrow look no he's not going to"
"11407500","11415100"," disturb the market and when that ball comes off of that interview tomorrow when that ball comes off"
"11415100","11422000"," that interview tomorrow with him not disturbing the market you don't have a lot of reasons to go"
"11422000","11430300"," down so so i'm against i'm against this whole concept because i was listening to some of these"
"11430300","11434140"," interviews this morning i'm like people are out of their fucking minds some of what they're saying"
"11434140","11444070"," and they're out of their minds out of their minds we're coming into a"
"11444070","11452590"," seasonally weak part of the year fall we're coming into a seasonally really weak part of the year"
"11452590","11462110"," late winter we're coming down to the seasonally bottom of our market in late spring of"
"11462110","11472110"," 2024 these are known he knows this do you think he wants to amplify that you're out"
"11472110","11482030"," of your fucking minds again you really are he knows this is coming he doesn't have to do"
"11482030","11490810"," anything for that to happen if anything if anything he has to do nothing"
"11490810","11496790"," and then in the in the worst part of that period he can come out and say we cut rates"
"11496790","11506330"," market will roll down and he can kill two birds with one stone this would also"
"11506330","11514410"," this the other part of this conversation is your thesis being that he wants to crash this market"
"11514410","11519490"," here right now right let's say you say that yeah we want to crash the market drum wants to crash"
"11519490","11527570"," this market right here right right where we are that's a Jerome's plan is he should just cut rates"
"11527570","11532790"," right now shouldn't he just cut him should come out today and be like tomorrow and be like we're"
"11532790","11541010"," cutting rates emergency rate cut today that would make sense it would be logical you notice here"
"11541010","11546910"," i'm saying uh or maybe you're expecting rate cuts in December and they ask a seller ask your"
"11546910","11552270"," favorite seller are you expecting rate cuts in september they're expecting rate cuts in december"
"11552270","11556890"," because then that would make sense to me i'd be with you be like yeah i get you okay so"
"11556890","11561090"," we're going down here because they're cutting rates they're they're going to tell you no they're"
"11561090","11567330"," never going to tell you that sellers never going to tell you um no i'm expecting that i'm expecting"
"11567330","11574550"," rates to go up to uh 20 percent and we're going to crash right so so some of this argument"
"11574550","11581430"," really makes any sense you know like this you can't be arguing all these different points and then"
"11581430","11592580"," be taking all the worst answers it's just not how it happens ever ever that way so this"
"11592580","11596320"," one guy this morning was talking i was like this guy's i was fucking mind he's like crazy they're"
"11596320","11600520"," like i don't think he's crazy i think he has a motivation that's about it like sky's trying to make"
"11600520","11605380"," money somewhere uh he's an ulterior motive board he's saying this morning it's your job as a"
"11605380","11611820"," retailer to understand and decipher what is real and what is not then the implications of this"
"11611820","11617340"," stuff i'm going to leave you with this last part of the implications of this stuff if you think"
"11617340","11626320"," that Jerome Powell wants to crash this fucking market at 4.33 today and then continue on with"
"11626320","11635800"," seasonal non seasonal down coming then risk going below 3500 and then start trading like"
"11635800","11644800"," 2800s and 26s 16s and all that kind of stuff you're talking about you're talking about what talking"
"11644800","11654320"," about the bull case being over 2024 2025 likely 2026 somewhere in there some recovery in there"
"11654320","11659740"," uh i don't think you i don't think that's his job to do that i don't think that's part of"
"11659740","11667160"," his mandate to do that so i think for him to walk away and say i did my job if"
"11667160","11672020"," we bounced on 35 he'd be like hey i did great look at that i stopped it in 2022 and"
"11672020","11679420"," we got a confirmation down here and we're going to continue on down the road so i i disagree with"
"11679420","11684860"," that whole entire concept as a matter of fact he'd look even better and if we traded that 48 slam"
"11684860","11694800"," down traded 4,300 at the worst caught a bounce on 38 right he announces rate cuts way up there"
"11694800","11700400"," we roll down everyone you'll hear everyone out there saying why is the market crashing while he"
"11700400","11705600"," just announced rate cuts you're going to see people out there right before that roll you're going"
"11705600","11713420"," to see people out there buying homes then their homes are going to lose value right and be like"
"11713420","11717520"," we're not buying but selling they're like i'm selling my house and they're going to they're going"
"11717520","11722820"," to panic lower the lower the prices other houses he's going to get the housing prices down that way"
"11725080","11730000"," and then you're going to then you're going to get the actual bottom in the marketplace and you know"
"11730000","11737100"," the rate cuts will be done and boom we start restart another bull run get what i'm saying housing"
"11737100","11744080"," prices are down these people sold their homes and they bought into something else that's overpriced"
"11744080","11755380"," and they're now the bag holders no so outside of something like outside of something like no"
"11755380","11779930"," outside of something like oh should i take some puts here hold on a second here i"
"11779930","11787170"," got some 438s here we'll see if we can get some one more down move over here get some 438s"
"11787170","11796590"," looking for that target right there 438 17 long 438 p so i don't think you'd get that i don't"
"11796590","11803630"," think you'd get the the geroam like super hoc tomorrow i don't think you get this geroam super hoc"
"11803630","11810970"," i don't think that you'd get the what you're looking for here now saying all of that saying that"
"11810970","11817910"," whole entire diatribe right what are your expectations where do you think things are going we still"
"11817910","11826550"," have that looming weekly trigger down below and that 450 area showed it to you guys earlier today i"
"11826550","11833490"," showed you guys this morning those two those two places above right the first one i believe is 450"
"11833490","11841330"," 448 450 and the next one is we look at it right now so you can find it again so"
"11841330","11851230"," it's a 448 04 to 459 and the next band is 46 34 to 458 68 so"
"11851230","11858070"," if you see that even if you see that roll down into weekly at 427 i'm just going to still"
"11858070","11867250"," expect that bounce higher and trade then trade that 456 and believe it or not trade"
"11867250","11876470"," 464 63 56 to 4 66 04 into end of quarter"
"11876470","11881150"," believe it or not in the end of quarter time's running out for bulls they're losing their time man"
"11881150","11890750"," they really are so the one other one other thing i would say to this would be i'm really fascinated"
"11890750","11897810"," at that 448 to see what happens does that get a rejection or do we break above it is there"
"11897810","11905090"," any kind of catalyst oh that would that would be that remember when i showed you the last quarter"
"11905090","11913130"," when the bulls actually stepped in reversed it to the upside that would be another catalyst price"
"11913130","11922210"," action to see a major reversal to the upside to close out the quarter green trade 19 right now in"
"11922210","11931790"," 438 p's so we'll we'll pay attention to this closely we're going to watch this closely and see how"
"11931790","11947950"," this works itself out pink tire for a minute I'm"
"11947950","11954570"," going to see if we can get a confirmation down bar here right here i just want to see if"
"11954570","11964080"," we can get this reversal to the downside let's get this here i want to see like a nice rejection"
"11964080","11975610"," here go way lower right there so hold on here i'm going to be careful with this trade target"
"11975610","11987460"," right here so"
"11987460","11991940"," i don't i don't see it like i don't see the i don't see the germ i see the germ"
"11991940","12000920"," i'm getting more and more uh dovish so let's say we have a zero line and we have a negative"
"12000920","12008620"," 10 is super hoc right and we're let's say we're at plus one right now my expectation here is you're"
"12008620","12018160"," going to see over the next months you're going to see like a plus one the last meeting right"
"12018160","12022780"," you're going to the next meeting you're going to see plus two and you're going to see plus three"
"12022780","12029300"," and plus four and plus five and as we get closer to that plus 10 right and we get to"
"12029300","12037680"," that plus 10 guess where the market should be down right so the question is only the only question"
"12037680","12046160"," that's left is where does that start does it start at that 465 does it start at 480 or 72"
"12046160","12052220"," 480 in the timing of it because i don't see the rate i think the rate cuts at at best"
"12052220","12062020"," at best or like late late spring early summer now this runs into one other thing one other huge"
"12062020","12068040"," thing and that would be like option three you're not going to get the option one or two where he's"
"12068040","12077160"," cutting rates or he's raising rates option three is where he tries to shift over into this like"
"12077160","12085760"," this this bullshit from like we're actually going to hold rates here at that's eight seven and a"
"12085760","12090500"," half eight percent and we're going to we're going to raise over time we're just going to slow down"
"12090500","12099920"," those raising of rates the one big uh fly in that ointment is politics and if you think you're"
"12099920","12107780"," going to treat the United States like the 1950s 60s and 70s i have something really sad to tell you"
"12108820","12117340"," uh the greed in this country is out of fucking control it is it is absolutely absolutely"
"12117340","12126700"," criminal how much greed there is in this country and it has become a monster"
"12126700","12136360"," started back in 1978 it got disgusting in the 1990s especially with the tax code the"
"12136360","12143480"," tax code was changed in the late 60s started in the 60s and then the 70s and then the just"
"12143480","12150960"," the full-on grossness continued in the 90s continuing the 80s too with with uh Reagan and it's only"
"12150960","12157900"," gotten worse and when you ask me what do i think about that right like hey cap what do you"
"12157900","12162620"," think do you think they're going to reform that no i'm going to give you a few reasons why i"
"12162620","12170360"," say no to that one if you remember back you remember back when they had um i think i don't"
"12170360","12178000"," know if it was a drunken miller or it was some old guy who was he was on CNBC and"
"12178000","12184240"," he said on CNBC uh forget his name and he was i forget his name right now but he was"
"12184240","12189940"," on CNBC and he had a big story he was on like CNN he was on CNBC and he was"
"12189940","12199440"," like never in history uh we were we're so grossly or it was Ford PE's are disgusting"
"12199440","12208160"," and uh you know it's out of control PE's are out of control and all these people trying to run"
"12208160","12217700"," up PE ratios and i showed you a chart going back to the 70s and right at that moment is"
"12217700","12224820"," when they bought the bottom on S&P 500 and Q's that was in october right on the PE line"
"12224820","12230200"," there's like this line that goes straight up into the right and he bought it too and they haven't"
"12230200","12237940"," stopped buying that line going up since 1978 that was the bottom of the line right there um and"

"13848320","13857740"," would be like the nice alternative alternative to like the old"
"13857740","13864700"," because of what he did to uh trump or something like that he would be your like um he would"
"13864700","13871980"," be your your your your alternative candidate but i don't when i looked at him last night i was like"

"13901880","13908380"," didn't care i was more interested in um it's impact on the stock market it's impact on but my truly"
"13908380","13916240"," my reason i watched that debate last night was if they broke out some kind of a populist a"
"13916240","13923360"," republican populist and i didn't see that uh the closest thing to that that person running the"
"13923360","13929980"," reason i'm saying that is because that does impact the stock market they bring out somebody like if"
"13929980","13934640"," they bring out somebody like a rock like dwayne the rock johnson and he doesn't say anything that's"
"13934640","13942440"," dividing of people i don't care if it's somebody like that and they they run them like they did"
"13942440","13949540"," with reagan he has a chance of winning and uh that would impact the stock market now the closest i"

"13958420","13963640"," thing man he didn't have it for me so i think they got to go i think they got to"
"13963640","13974500"," bring out the rock or something like that yeah"
"13974500","13979480"," yeah so dug dug would actually do well with pence too right he would he's a good pence alternative"
"13979480","13988040"," um if you want that old typical republican he would fit that bill much better than uh the other guy"
"13988040","13995000"," there dug bergman he would have the better um he's like he he seems like a guy that's like you're"
"13995000","13998380"," not gonna you know i mean i guess you might have touched him messing with little boys or something"
"13998380","14002240"," but outside of that he looks like uh he looks like fell off the term truck it looks like you"
"14002240","14010780"," like you you can sell he's not he's eating like a steak at the okay corral or something he eats"

"14453930","14461430"," like hit it more of an originalist that's a good way to describe it i did notice that last night"
"14461430","14467490"," so his platform he was all over the place i was like this guy is just taking shots this guy's"
"14467490","14472270"," coming out swinging he's like he's like there was i think it was somebody said about trump and i"
"14472270","14476350"," was like i was like if the guy it was like if the other guy had said something positive about"
"14476350","14481050"," trump he were probably taking a swipe i don't know if it was christie or someone else maybe it was"
"14481050","14485430"," uh pants i don't remember but i was like this guy looks like he would have taken a swipe if"
"14485430","14491110"," they were pro trump or or uh anti-Trump it wouldn't have mattered it was just more of like i'm"
"14491110","14502130"," gonna take a big-ass swing at you pitch in the face that's what it seemed like so"
"14502130","14508550"," that's what i got on that debate i can't wait to see the uh uh democratic debate and i'm mostly"
"14508550","14518250"," uh i'm fascinated by this for two reasons uh or another reason i'm fascinated by this is because"
"14518250","14527290"," of Biden now uh dude Biden's not looking good either uh Biden you know his age is getting up there"
"14527290","14531530"," they got a pump and full of uh Adderall and stuff you know that's what they do they did it"
"14531530","14536490"," with trump too in my view they did it with trump and with with Biden you guys getting old you"
"14536490","14542310"," can't deny that he's not getting old and then the fascinating thing to me is uh does he i know"
"14542310","14550590"," that these guys are these people never give up power like diane feinstein is another fine example"
"14550590","14556710"," and it's not just her they got the other guy there from who is the guy from a strum firm"
"14556710","14565410"," to strum strum Thurmond that guy was in that guy basically died in the senate right and guy was"
"14565410","14571170"," like there since the 1950s or something like these people won't give up power like none of them i"
"14571170","14576030"," don't care how they're party they're from and their inner circle won't either like the people that"
"14576030","14581810"," they employ people that have jobs they'll run these candidates until they die as well because they"
"14581810","14586650"," don't want to lose that sphere of influence they have so do i think that Biden has the will to"
"14586650","14593950"," run yes he doesn't care if he dies in office uh who's he gonna run though as is uh vp"
"14593950","14601330"," kamala harris uh that's a question mark more so than it ever even was in the last election do you"
"14601330","14607070"," want her as your uh vp possibly uh during his term as it's going to be a question for the"
"14607070","14615390"," dems and is he a one-term president was he like was Biden brought in just because uh no we"
"14615390","14621210"," just didn't want trump anymore right that's a big question is it just a matter of you know you just"
"14621210","14625310"," we're gonna get trump out of there we're gonna put somebody in he's not gonna do too much damage i"
"14625310","14629770"," know if you're republican you think uh Biden did damage Biden's done a lot of the shit that trump"
"14629770","14635990"," said he was gonna do which is crazy uh a lot of the status quo has been maintained with Biden"
"14635990","14642970"," in office in my view so uh i don't i'm fascinated by this as we head into this next election"
"14642970","14650790"," uh to see who the democrats are anointing to be the president if it's Biden who's his running mate"
"14650790","14657390"," i know you're gonna say it's harris and can they get away with that in this next election will that"
"14657390","14663850"," will that fly with the voter uh and how do you how do you uh sell that to the voter"
"14663850","14673370"," because i think these voters coming in if i was a voter coming into this election uh and i was"
"14673370","14683610"," uh stuck in my house uh and couldn't sell it to move if my taxes were high uh"
"14683610","14692630"," if there was uncertainty with rates continuing higher with my taxation though all those questions i"
"14692630","14699490"," would need to have answered heading into this election and uh the cost of goods the cost of"
"14699490","14705930"," inflation the real cost of this stuff and who's going to answer those questions for me i didn't get"
"14705930","14710890"," a lot of those answers last night and the answers that were given last night on those questions"
"14712370","14721330"," they were evasive or they weren't making sense uh some fascinated by that stuff i'm fascinated by"
"14721330","14726710"," because i know how these people vote how i vote it's most people vote like this historically that's"
"14726710","14732370"," how people vote they don't mind all the hot button issues but it's always about the dollar in your"
"14732370","14739430"," pocket telling you it's always about that dollar how far your dollar goes can you afford your"
"14739430","14744730"," mortgage your rent are you getting paid enough money are you paying too much in taxes that stuff"
"14744730","14752090"," matters to an actual voter i didn't see that stuff answered last night in that debate so i'm so i"
"14752090","14761360"," want to see what happens yeah she's gonna have to develop that's one thing for i'm a democrat"
"14761360","14768780"," that's one very big negative i think she's a um i don't mind replacing with a with a woman either"
"14768780","14774000"," or a woman of color or anything like that don't have any problems that uh he has a problem or"
"14774000","14779400"," she so she came in like last place in the primary right uh i think she was in last place"
"14779400","14786640"," second to last place i think um she's not well liked uh by democrats and i think democrats are at"
"14786640","14791220"," that one moment where they're like yeah you know it will take her but we're not we're not we don't"
"14791220","14800940"," want to be president so that's a big question mark for me uh can she be president yeah Newsom"
"14800940","14809800"," uh you got Newsom you got i don't know who else Dems could possibly run but i'd like to like"
"14809800","14815520"," i think Newsom Biden ticket might work you know like a Biden president Newsom vice president could"
"14815520","14821380"," be a winner for the Dems if they wanted that it's hard for me to see uh Biden and um"
"14821380","14827620"," and Kamala Harris uh winning this next or not that they won't win they can win if the republicans"
"14827620","14838520"," run someone crazy enough that they can win um if the republicans could run someone that's"

"19661420","19672840"," buyers well there we've got known demand right here right that's known demand uh"
"19672840","19680200"," the bulls are saying the buyers are saying that they're up here but they've moved higher so far"

"19712060","19717040"," squeezing to the upside if you get like the if you get like the dovish fed that's my expectation to"
"19717040","19722580"," get the dovish fed that you're going to get a squeeze higher now if you're a bull you might not"
"19722580","19728040"," get that squeeze tomorrow that's my one key to you would be if dealers if we come in tomorrow and"
"19728040","19734440"," you get the bullish fed you might get a failure up here at 441 or even 444 so pay attention"
"19734440","19739200"," to that tomorrow if you're like if you're like me saying hey you're going to get the um the dovish"
"19739200","19745940"," uh Jerome Powell be concerned about dealers stopping that trade and not actually doing that print"
"19745940","19752800"," to 450 until monday or wednesday of next week so be aware of that if you're like well i'm bullish"
"19752800","19760020"," on Jerome right you end up getting that that squeeze up here re-pricing of options so a spread"
"19760020","19766920"," might actually be your best bet for like next wednesday to the upside like 450c spread to the"
"19766920","19772340"," upside on wednesday this shows monday but it's for wednesday and that is just to clear out or not"
"19772340","19777740"," not to deal with the vol that comes off that event the re-pricing of options if you're a bear"

"19795720","19803460"," a magnet magnet actually 420 so there's a jpm collar trade for this quarter all the way down here"
"19803460","19813420"," at this 420 so we'll write that in right now too got the jpm collar that's right here this"

"20020530","20024430"," in 12 or 10 o'clock i wanted to be in 12 o'clock we hit that low and so"
"20024430","20030710"," even right here i'm going to expect this move higher and i'm going to expect futures to get sold by"
"20030710","20040570"," 6 a.m. somewhere up in here probably at 440 give a target of 440 in futures to sell this"
"20040570","20046730"," down into Jerome's meeting and then once that's done we're going to square and squeeze higher i'm"
"20046730","20052910"," going to go with Jerome being very positive into this open tomorrow or into this speech that he's"
"20052910","20057870"," giving tomorrow i think that i think you'll still get the vol from it going into it but i don't"
"20057870","20063450"," think you get the um i don't think you get the bloodbath i think you get this i think you"
"20063450","20069630"," get down into here right maybe you get some blood into that into that Jerome speaking let's see"
"20069630","20076210"," what time that is again tomorrow uh 10 oh 5 a.m so right around bloodbath down at 10 o "
"20076210","20083530","'clock sorry a little bit before right there bloodbath into 10 o'clock and then i don't think you"
"20083530","20087970"," get the Jerome that you think you're getting i think as soon as he starts talking he starts to"
"20087970","20094750"," dissuade or tell people to get fucked you might get this tomorrow this 440 441 and then the bit the"
"20094750","20102610"," greater move will come in into next week to the upside now if we do if you wanted to buy"
"20102610","20109370"," puts into tomorrow my personal belief is that you would do it like four o'clock the 415 something"
"20109370","20115710"," like that try to capture that if that happens if we squeeze up into this close right here and"
"20115710","20120770"," you're buying puts into tomorrow and we sell down just like i do every day right if we're selling"
"20120770","20127470"," down or up into um the open you close that position i guess you could try to hold it for"
"20127470","20131510"," half an hour down here but for me if you get that trade you just take the money and run"
"20131510","20139610"," so we'll see what happens here in this close my expectation for tomorrow is a low our expectation"
"20139610","20145010"," for today is that we trade up into this close uh you'll get a sell on 440 in the overnight"
"20145010","20150810"," and then the low to the downside is going to trade to let me take a look at it really"
"20150810","20161480"," quick price target for tomorrow 435"
"20161480","20170570"," 35 right here price target for tomorrow let's see how close we get to it"
"20170570","20179610"," let me kind of a fun exercise PT for front downside PT for tomorrow"
"20179610","20189490"," price target 435 35 that was like doing this shit so right here"
"20189490","20194830"," for tomorrow this is friday price target for tomorrow we draw these in every day don't we or we've"
"20194830","20203590"," been doing it we'll squeeze up here 440 in the overnight then right down here by open tomorrow"
"20203590","20209810"," and i don't think you get your uh i'll even draw and we'll just leave"
"20209810","20229320"," this up for 11 o'clock and"
"20229320","20235320"," i think by in a day you wind up right up here well this guy's been kind of kook-kook "
"20235320","20244300","-y it might be 443 bring that back right tomorrow be like down here we're gonna dump that dude again"
"20250360","20259200"," I think you're somewhere that's like 440 initial squeeze consolidate and then this bigger move up"
"20259200","20269140"," into the close right there something like that tomorrow we'll just put that back here"
"20269140","20275800"," if you're a futures trader i'd be trying to sell the fuck out of 440 in the overnight i don't"
"20275800","20278900"," know if you're a futures trader but that's what i'd be looking for i'm going to look for dealers to"
"20278900","20286620"," help out the bulls here into the close not on this i'm i'm not on this uh this bloodbath into"
"20286620","20290420"," the close today unless some of you are you think that's what's going to happen i don't think so"
"20290420","20295240"," maybe it's possible if you do get the bloodbath into the close say if you're a bear you like"
"20295240","20302060"," thinking yeah bloodbath panic sell this down traders await uh fed Jerome Powell then this target"
"20302060","20313230"," would be lower this target would actually be 433 16 so"
"20313230","20323910"," if we sell the close today if we sell the close today what if we sell close today uh"
"20323910","20333890"," 433 16 would be the expectation for tomorrow so if you see this selling"
"20333890","20337790"," if you see like you know sometimes we'll see this bounce on the into the valley see some kind of"
"20337790","20343590"," craziness like this and whatever they do up in here is going to get violently sold down by open"
"20343590","20348970"," down here or like 10 a.m i said open but i think 10 a.m down there maybe it"
"20348970","20355870"," opens like right here and then we then we blast down so right down there i don't think we do"
"20355870","20362670"," it into this close at all now here's my larger my larger outlook so into next week what i think"
"20362670","20368110"," is going to happen it's a 15 minute trade right so this is uh 50 minute trade this is friday"
"20368110","20381290"," this is monday tuesday wednesday friday oh hold on there's your"
"20381290","20394280"," warning up here down"
"20394280","20399400"," into next week and then by wednesday monday tuesday wednesday and we're right up here at that 450"
"20399400","20406440"," and this is where i'm scared uh this is where i'm really scared it's like this 450 what i'm scared"
"20406440","20416320"," about this is this 459 460 up here this whole zone up here is going to be a"
"20416320","20424180"," big big for the next month coming into the 31st end of month you're going to call window you're"
"20424180","20427560"," going to say it's window dressing so you're going to try to tell me you're going to try to tell"
"20427560","20437160"," me in the chat just window dressing cap i'm going to tell you that it's not window dressing but i"
"20437160","20443020"," my fear here coming into the 31st that i don't want to see let's start keep this on your palate"
"20443020","20449000"," here what i don't want to see is that failure after the 31st end of the first and we then"
"20449000","20455940"," go back down and trade that 426 this would be the signal with that the bull run is over so"
"20455940","20461780"," as time passes you've heard me talk about bulls having only so much time to get things done this is"
"20461780","20468560"," kind of the last kind of like the last hurrah for bulls they have you know this is the 31st"
"20468560","20474680"," right here if you have a failure at that 50 or 48 coming into the 31st and they start to"
"20474680","20480740"," sell this down into the month of september then you know that you've only got a month left to the"
"20480740","20490200"," quarter and uh they'll likely pin uh that 420 420 they'll likely pin this 420"
"20490200","20498040"," into september so if that fails into the first you will see a pin into the month of september at"
"20498040","20506540"," 420 probably about the 15th and we'll we'll bounce around it we could even go lower than the 420"
"20506540","20514780"," trade 400 and literally trade a zone above and below like 430 to 400 and just and just literally"
"20514780","20523540"," pin that 420 into end of september so bulls kind of at the at the ass end of their run"
"20523540","20529100"," this is kind of the place right here there's not many we said this uh i think we said this"
"20529100","20539040"," back here right we said right we said right here we said bulls have to get it on they have"
"20539040","20544420"," no choice they have to go higher sitting at that same level once again and they really don't have"
"20544420","20554180"," any time left to to trade that 472 465 472 and it takes 480 off the table for december"
"20554180","20561680"," so i don't think that if you're going to pin 400 or 420 for the quarter that you can i"
"20561680","20566120"," don't think that you can actually say to yourself like on the straight face and say yeah we're at"
"20566120","20572900"," 420 let's say on september 20 or a city september 29th we're at 420 i don't think it was a"
"20572900","20580020"," straight face you can say yeah we're gonna put on 600 points in q4 is it possible yeah it's"
"20580020","20585420"," possible December we do some wack shit sometimes we'll put on crazy numbers the last month of the"
"20585420","20591360"," quarter but dude that's a big ask for bulls i would be suspect of you if you were a bull"
"20591360","20598160"," into i'd be suspect of you if you were a bull into this um if you were a bull into"
"20598160","20606240"," this q4 at 420 can it could be a weapon for and q4 yeah you're gonna get 480 fuck no"
"20606240","20614220"," even if you got 460 or 470 for december first your whole bull thesis is gone at that point in"
"20614220","20622680"," my view because they're gonna start q1 of 2024 and likely gonna we're gonna go pretty low in that"
"20622680","20631120"," q1 of q1 of 2024 the expectation in q1 of 2024 is a pretty deep low so you're gonna get"
"20631120","20637660"," your bear true bear suits on when we get into that uh january one you know likely be bullish you'll"
"20637660","20642800"," see like bulls saying uh everything's all set we just got a new higher something same like that but"
"20642800","20648040"," i will not be bullish at that point uh in the in the year at that point january first we"
"20648040","20653500"," pretty fucking bearish even if we're up there i mean pretty bearish at that point so just right now"
"20653500","20657340"," to tomorrow they're already trying to sell down pennant down here still long these calls got a"
"20657340","20662160"," bunch of them i don't believe them i don't think they're gonna close these in the money so we'll"
"20662160","20669300"," see if they do where they don't get the target above here that's all kind of wonky too target is"
"20669300","20674800"," that early trigger we'll see if they can pin it or if they sell this close into tomorrow so i'll"
"20674800","20679020"," be here with you tomorrow at 9 30 in the morning i'll try to get here early so that we"
"20679020","20684500"," don't miss the speech and we're ready for it here's that downside target still haven't hit it"
"20684500","20690100"," here's s2 down below and i might you know what i would do too is do i'm telling you i"
"20690100","20694700"," would fucking buy calls down here too into tomorrow i'd load i'd load the fuck out of some calls"
"20694700","20704320"," there too so yeah but put the stapler down"
"20704320","20710680"," yeah the grander scheme of things if you're looking at like a 15-minute chart i'm trying to buy"
"20710680","20716560"," calls down here not puts i have no interest in buying puts down here none all i want to do"
"20716560","20721940"," is buy calls to to the upside so i'm gonna stick with that it's worked quite well for me so"
"20721940","20727360"," we're gonna we're gonna stick with any of these super lows and stuff like that buying the dip and"
"20727360","20734400"," trying to get a 300% print or something we'll see what's going on in this close they had the"
"20734400","20740720"," low back here target down below weak into this close right now not looking good for bulls not"
"20740720","20748060"," looking good for my calls it's a 15-24 right now i got another 36 minutes so i think that"
"20748060","20752900"," explains what the expectation let me go back over to the mainstream i think that explains the"
"20752900","20759280"," thought process for uh bulls and bears bulls i gotta tell you man if you're a bull dude like if"
"20759280","20764260"," you're a bull dude if you like try tell if we bounce off four twenty six or four twenty seven"
"20764260","20769180"," or four twenty you try telling me that we're gonna go to all-time highs i'm gonna laugh in your"
"20769180","20775380"," face it's like that ain't happening not enough time so you like you better be like praying to the"
"20775380","20783280"," Jerome god tomorrow that he is makes this market rip faces off i think that you get that i think"
"20783280","20788300"," that you're i don't think Jerome wants this right now i think it's too my thesis here is that"
"20788300","20795260"," Jerome knows uh our Jerome won't be able to control uh what happens to the market that's my thesis"
"20795260","20803480"," is that uh he knows that uh cuts are coming in 2024 i think here where we are i was"
"20803480","20810100"," talking to my my buddy joe here and i'm like i'm like i'm like if we go from 433 to"
"20810100","20816760"," 350s only 800 points we can easily do that in seven months we can i think we do more than"
"20816760","20826100"," that in seven months so 600 points down between uh september and uh february was the september"
"20826100","20832480"," october december december january february march april would be eight months i'd expect the low in"
"20832480","20840020"," april the actual low and i like 3,500 i'm like yeah maybe it's 32 maybe it's 28 so we're"
"20840020","20846220"," gonna know quite quickly that that thought process there too right as we come into tomorrow with"
"20846220","20852020"," Jerome i want you to think about that thought process because what happens is what happens is if"
"20852020","20860240"," Jerome doesn't save the bulls right you're going to have a fundamental shift in the sentiment of"
"20860240","20865920"," the stock market tomorrow you'll have a fundamental shift and all those high targets that you have"
"20865920","20874120"," will shift to don't buy the market and wait until spring time of 2024 and that if you see that"
"20874120","20880820"," sentiment shift across the board from Jerome tomorrow to that negative even if we squeeze right"
"20880820","20888500"," even if we squeeze even if we go up if you see that sentiment shift that major sentiment shift in"
"20888500","20895260"," the marketplace you will never see that 4800 off the table for a long time like two three years"
"20895260","20899620"," likely something like that possibly about two three years something like that a year and a half"
"20899620","20904660"," something like that maybe year year year and a half to three years so we kind of fascinating to see"
"20904660","20909860"," what he says tomorrow i'm really fascinated to see what he says if he's if he is planning on that"

"20930000","20934520"," you'll find like cities will go bankrupt and stuff like that so i'd be fascinated to see that into"
"20934520","20941280"," the election season if that were to happen uh in the promises that would be made uh with that with"
"20941280","20949820"," that taking place into the election season so right now that downside target for 2438 17s looking"
