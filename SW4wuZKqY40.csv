"59180","59860"," Brian, John S."
"60280","60820"," All ass."
"61940","63060"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"63959","64360"," I'm Dylan."
"65380","65900"," Steven. "

"73240","75660"," Morning, John asked the coolest, baby."

"82860","83580"," Good to see you, Frank. "
"84720","84940"," Fisted."
"86020","86960"," Bobcat Dude, what's up?"
"87840","88520"," Dragon Wolf, CB."
"88920","89620"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"90360","91100"," Gavin, good morning. "
"94040","94920"," Hell yeah."
"96260","97600"," We got a lot to talk about this morning."
"99260","100820"," We got a few things to talk about. "
"101240","102460"," We're going to get this started here."
"102840","103560"," We're going to turn this down."
"104300","106380"," We're going to slide over. "
"108840","110300"," I don't know if I'm doing this right."
"110500","110620"," Wrong."
"110940","111160"," I don't know. "
"113140","114120"," I turn that too loud."
"114280","114960"," We'll turn this off."
"116100","117040"," Good morning, everybody. "
"117700","118260"," Mr. J."
"118480","118640"," Rambo."
"119220","120160"," Jill, good morning."
"127300","128100"," Good morning. "
"128180","128180"," Good morning."
"129520","130620"," How are y'all doing this morning?"
"130880","131400"," Everybody doing well?"
"132300","134020"," I hope everybody's doing well this morning."
"134960","137360"," Okay, so we're going to talk about some stuff right away. "
"137500","140420"," We're going to get some stuff out of the way here and get moving."
"141980","142980"," It was crazy, right?"
"143140","144480"," Because we're up right now, what, three bucks?"
"145100","149040"," And if you're actually about that dip, we were talking about that last few minutes of the clothes"
"149040","149560"," yesterday."
"150160","155080"," Well, we actually put two bucks on the board before we even closed yesterday. "
"155440","157200"," So I think we're up three dollars or something like that."
"157340","161520"," So we're already up 50 points or something crazy on this move so far."
"162240","167540"," So this move down below here was actually almost as deep as the low of the day. "
"168580","170280"," So the move is actually way down here."
"170280","172460"," It was down here for four to eight point zero six."
"173360","176780"," And we're now above here at four three two ninety three baby. "
"176780","179920"," That's 50 points doing nothing overnight."
"181440","181840"," Right?"
"183400","184960"," So we're going to talk about some this morning."
"184960","186220"," Okay, we got we got some issues. "
"187180","190180"," I want to be aware of this for the open and before you take this any further."
"190420","190600"," Okay?"
"191400","196140"," There are sellers hiding above at four three five zero."
"197300","199260"," Now you're going to hear people say we're going to four forty. "
"199560","201840"," We're going to hear people say we're going to four fifty somewhere."
"202060","203640"," We're going to trade higher and above and over."
"204340","209220"," We do have volatility tomorrow and we do have volatility on Friday no matter what you want to hear. "
"209320","209460"," Okay?"
"210220","213860"," And specifically on Friday, we've got some stuff with going on."
"213860","215220"," But I do want you to be aware."
"215440","215560"," Okay?"
"216020","220280"," That if you held this here in any kind of shape or form. "
"221680","223440"," You're going to take profit at some time this morning."
"223760","227500"," The next thing I want you to know is we can trade higher than forty three fifty."
"227960","231520"," But I'm telling you this seller's there and they're going to be some short stick. "
"231620","233400"," Make it squeeze the yada yada right?"
"233860","238040"," But I would do want you to understand that what you do is you take profit and we trade what's"
"238040","239800"," in front of us to the right always right?"
"240440","244480"," So if we're going to trade higher today, we can trade this to forty three fifty."
"245020","245460"," Right?"
"245900","249740"," We can trade this from forty three fifty higher to forty four hundred."
"249760","250200"," Right?"
"251240","253480"," But what we don't do is it don't fuck around with a couple of things. "
"253580","254380"," They don't fuck around in the middle."
"254760","255120"," Right?"
"255920","260320"," And the other thing we don't do is let the banks do the work at resistance and support levels."
"260320","260640"," Right?"
"261120","263100"," We look for those answers. "
"263460","263680"," Okay?"
"263680","267460"," So I want you to understand it this morning and we're going to talk about it because spot gamma,"
"267460","268640"," you know, they got a lot."
"268720","273180"," They got last night wrong and they got this morning wrong and that we talked about that yesterday"
"273180","273860"," too, right?"
"274020","278900"," Things that are happening so fast in the market they can't track and that we can track, right?"
"279420","281360"," So we did have dealers by futures last night."
"281820","286180"," We did have gamma roll off a negative gamma roll off three hundred thousand contracts roll off. "
"286180","289000"," We had puts hit twice."
"289740","293520"," So what do you think market makers are going to pay those guys three times right now?"
"293720","294180"," Fuck no."
"294480","294620"," Okay?"
"295000","296460"," So a way to be understanding of that. "
"296560","299820"," And then I want you to look at the report from last night that was kind of hidden I think"
"299820","300740"," in the spot gamma site."
"301060","302320"," Then we're going to look at this morning's report."
"302460","303900"," This is the PM report from yesterday. "
"304120","304440"," Okay?"
"305340","306240"," Now we're going to look at this."
"313880","314200"," Okay?"
"315540","318420"," The market closed at the key forty three hundred level."
"319580","320000"," Okay?"
"320260","321620"," So we're going to look at this real quick. "
"321780","322820"," This is the PM from yesterday."
"324440","325740"," So this is the key."
"325880","326020"," Okay?"
"326140","330000"," Today marked an interesting intersection of the key spot gamma support line of four two seven zero"
"330000","332780"," and a positive delta options trades. "
"332980","337620"," We believe Biden's mild comments were into the key four two seven support line and then met with"
"337620","338640"," positive delta activity."
"338640","342680"," The sharp sharp process of data, the game position."
"342960","344740"," This is a 60 handle rally. "
"345020","350160"," Unsurprisingly, that rally they'll reverse into the close as the short cover fuel drained out."
"350380","350460"," Okay?"
"350580","351380"," So be careful of that."
"352460","357140"," Tomorrow's action should be much like today's characterized by large directional swings. "
"357420","360080"," We're holding four four zero zero major overhead resistance."
"360640","362480"," See today's test of four two seven zero."
"362800","363800"," This is the key away to see. "
"363800","364020"," Okay?"
"366430","373070"," As unlocking a step lower to the test of four two seven zero unlocks the step lower to four one"
"373070","374050"," six five."
"374050","374430"," Okay?"
"374990","377210"," Be conscious and careful of this number right here."
"377270","377430"," Okay?"
"378110","380550"," Opens the step lower to four one six five. "
"381090","383430"," So we have lower prices ahead over time."
"385130","385870"," Hold on here."
"389270","391490"," And I think that's all it needs to be said on this one. "
"391850","394310"," And that's the only thing you need to understand on that one."
"394310","399810"," Now, this morning, futures shifted shifted higher to 43 32."
"400090","406510"," We've seen 4300 level fill in the with positions is now a lot to largest whole gamma strike on the"
"406510","408090"," board from 4400. "
"409370","413670"," With that, we see 4200 as the put wall down from 4300."
"413870","414010"," Okay?"
"414650","416150"," The put wall is now gone lower."
"417190","421870"," This speaks to the general to the general trend of the options market accepting repositioning"
"421870","422690"," around lower prices. "
"423270","425550"," Overhead resistance is at 4350."
"426230","426230"," Okay?"
"426430","428630"," So be conscious of this number as we open today."
"432060","435240"," And then a 4400 be conscious of this number. "
"435400","435560"," Okay?"
"436860","439240"," And then it says support lies down here."
"440520","443440"," 4300 and then 42 65."
"444620","449200"," But that still means we can trade lower, even though support is down at 4600 means we can trade"
"449200","449520"," lower. "
"450500","455860"," Those prices at 41 65 because it's case to be conscious that we're trading lower."
"456260","460660"," Our trading zone is still going lower, even though we're trading higher today."
"462980","465900"," Yesterday, there were a few rallies in the context of the market would end at which ended lower. "
"465900","470840"," We believe that these rallies are fueled by covering of shorts during put options, a trading which"
"470840","473100"," led largely tied to geopolitical events."
"474080","478440"," With the markets flowing around in response to various headlines, the SFP term structure shown"
"478440","480800"," below remains in a backwards dated state."
"482080","483920"," Showing that short term protection remains in demand. "
"484560","491700"," Short dated implied volatility near 20% equates the market pricing is in a 1.7% daily move, which"
"491700","497780"," is higher than our gamma driven forecast of 1.3%. There's some key points there."
"497840","502000"," To this point, we feel the selling has been controlled demolition and has respected major options"
"502000","502400"," levels."
"503340","507220"," There is a lot of volatility, but it seems to be within the confines of what is being priced in. "
"507360","509580"," We've not seen that washout and type of sale is selling."
"510220","511520"," It often comes with cop capitulation."
"512500","514400"," The risk of this event is certainly elevated with the trigger. "
"515159","519260"," We're going to have to be something to catch this put heavy market by surprise and bring a"
"519260","521600"," significant greater than 2% down move."
"522400","525160"," With this in mind over the long term, hold on a second."
"528600","536480"," So at this point right here is discussing that huge move down that we're going to see supposedly"
"536480","537460"," after this rip. "
"537680","543180"," We'll see this rip and everyone is expecting this massive, massive liquidation thereafter."
"545220","547300"," So I want you to be conscious of this right there."
"547380","548780"," You might not see it like that. "
"548900","553300"," You might not see like this massive just sell the market after this rip phase."
"553920","557040"," With that in mind over the longer term, we tend to give the edge the market taking steps lower."
"558040","563500"," With 4,200, the major level on break of 4,270. "
"564020","564920"," Be careful of this right here."
"567130","571890"," So 4,270, I think it's a little bit lower, but 4,270 opens the door to 4,200."
"571890","577770"," 4,050 remains where we see significant longer term support. "
"577990","585690"," So if you're looking for a place to long this market, probably between 390 and 4050."
"586490","587850"," We'll start taking longs."
"587950","596170"," As we trade closer to this, I'll start to get you guys some stocks to start looking at so that"
"596170","599590"," we can put a portfolio together to long this market. "
"599590","603810"," So just be aware of this as we trade closer to this 4,450."
"604130","605030"," I think it's a little bit lower."
"605710","606530"," We'll take that. "
"606550","610430"," We'll take that trade and we'll hold that from anywhere from probably 1 to 3 months."
"613050","618670"," However, on a more immediate basis, we think the markets that stage a strong short cover rallying"
"618670","620970"," rally up to the 4,400 level."
"621530","625370"," This idea is mainly through the lens of the traders being possibly a bit overhead. "
"625770","627250"," We talked about this yesterday, right?"
"628130","632670"," The puts being rich and a market shift higher can create a capitulation trade for short-term put"
"632670","632970"," holders."
"633510","635910"," We call it when nothing happens enough for short-term puts to decay."
"636510","638190"," It provokes a stock tailwind. "
"639370","640370"," We've got no news today."
"642370","644150"," Nobody's harping on Russia right now."
"644450","646230"," Everything's quiet on the Russian front, right?"
"647110","648050"," Intentional in the markets. "
"649750","652030"," We, of course, look for this move to ultimately fade."
"652650","658550"," As has been the trend since recent rifts higher, a break of 4,300 would render this idea invalid."
"659510","662770"," So today, we can touch 4,300. "
"662870","666890"," We can fuck around 4,300, but if we break it, right?"
"667030","667650"," We break through below."
"667870","668830"," We start trading lower."
"669810","671570"," You know that the trade is over, okay?"
"672750","675690"," If you take your profit off the bell and then we trade down a 4,300. "
"676010","677470"," We can take that rip higher to 4,400."
"677550","678210"," We can do that as well."
"678630","681150"," But just be conscious of this number today. "
"681150","681610"," All right?"
"681730","684970"," You get your numbers now for today that you need your key levels or you need to understand."
"685410","686330"," I'm going to scroll through this."
"686390","687410"," You can pause this broadcast. "
"688150","688890"," Come back through."
"689450","690250"," Pause this by broadcast."
"690550","693090"," Look at key supports for all the major indexes. "
"693930","696810"," Key index support and resistance levels."
"697310","698390"," You see this over here, right?"
"698670","704050"," 43.25. The vol trigger 45.20. Okay."
"704270","705790"," Just be conscious of these numbers over here. "
"709760","710980"," I'm going to look through all these."
"712920","716480"," So you guys can get your information."
"717180","721100"," So for myself, what I'm going to say to you is on the bell, take profit. "
"721360","723380"," Or we could take profit on the bottom."
"723760","725160"," Let it red bar down."
"725780","729000"," If it red bars down off the bell, then we hold 43,300. "
"729980","730960"," Then we write it up."
"731800","731940"," Okay."
"732120","734180"," We're going to look at it again on this chart right here. "
"735800","737340"," So you got 43.20, right?"
"737820","739760"," You have 43 down here."
"740160","742420"," Just on your own chart at home, whatever you're doing."
"743440","746020"," Just make yourself a nice little line right here. "
"746120","746980"," You can do whatever you want."
"747900","750100"," You can put something like this here."
"750900","751300"," Make it small. "
"753180","754700"," You can write yourself a message."
"760640","762080"," Write something like must hold."
"763440","766160"," Doesn't matter if we bounce down there. "
"768960","771220"," Doesn't matter if we bounce down here and then bounce back up."
"771460","775580"," We don't want it to come down, have resistance form, and then start trading lower."
"776620","777660"," Bad, bad juju. "
"778560","781800"," The preference is that we bounce, or we don't go any lower."
"781940","784520"," We don't trade back any lower than this 4300 down here, right?"
"784720","786840"," Because this is pretty much where we were at the close yesterday."
"787800","789060"," And we're looking for higher prices. "
"789440","791940"," We talked yesterday about where you want to be taking shorts in the market."
"792600","795700"," And when I was talking to you guys about where you want to be taking shorts in the market, I"
"795700","797240"," guess I paid pretty well taking shorts."
"797740","799440"," But in reality, you wanted to take it back here. "
"800400","801180"," Not over here."
"801740","802480"," Not over here."
"802600","803420"," You wanted to take it up here. "
"803840","807260"," You wanted to take it up here somewhere, right here, or at least here somewhere in here."
"807600","811060"," You wanted to take another one right here and close them out yesterday."
"811760","814440"," And that still holds true somewhere up in here. "
"814540","818560"," So hopefully if you're a bear, you're going to stick around, wait until we trade higher."
"819080","824940"," There might be a rejection of 43.50. But in reality, bears want to get all their juice, right?"
"825940","830360"," They're going to want to take a short in safety somewhere in here."
"831060","833680"," You're going to see some people telling you that we're trading higher. "
"833980","836920"," We're going to trade delta highs, whatever they're telling you, 4,500."
"837320","838060"," We can do that."
"838700","840420"," But we're going to trade each level on the way up. "
"841280","844680"," We're going to add protection in as we get close to this 4,400."
"845080","845120"," Okay."
"845520","846580"," Some kind of in the money stuff. "
"847020","852360"," We'll get more aggressive as we start to trade down to that 4,000 level of time moves board."
"853980","856060"," And that's all I got to say to the city this morning."
"856060","857480"," I just want you guys to be aware where we're at. "
"857800","860180"," I want you guys to take money off the table whenever you can."
"860520","861780"," One last thing about taking money off the table."
"861780","864800"," Let's say you guys made, I don't know, $1,000 on the open today. "
"865480","866660"," Take the $1,000 off the table."
"867240","869700"," Make your next trade, you know, $100 off that $1,000."
"869880","870760"," Keep some money for yourself. "
"871420","872820"," Enjoy some of your money out there."

"10005450","10011290"," lots of calls coming in an RSX right now My assumption is you can see where we are, right?"
"10011470","10017590"," This is why we've got calls coming in an RSX you guys see why You get calls coming in an"
"10017590","10021170"," RSX It's been pimped up and propped up. "

"10054930","10055870"," this is not a buy program."
"10055950","10063150"," So just so you guys know right the the difference Uh, so this is short covering that's happening"
"10063150","10073030"," right now on the spy And uh, it's not being pressured into a squeeze hire Now you might see it"
"10073030","10077970"," but currently at this moment on the spy if you look at the way that it's going up Uh, this"
"10077970","10078810"," isn't a melt up."
"10079130","10080470"," This isn't a squeeze hire. "
"10080870","10086390"," These are shorts that are covering Uh, you would see different kinds of behavior in the spy right"
"10086390","10092630"," now If we were short covering and being squeezed And if you had short covering with squeezes with"
"10092630","10097350"," with more real money flow coming into the market So right now we've got more calls coming on the"
"10097350","10107010"," spy february 23rd 428 PRC scratch that 428 c 476 000 and more calls in the spy february 25th 431"
"10107010","10116970"," c for 157 thousand dollars You You are looking forward to our different behaviors in the spy"
"10116970","10123330"," 80 stock Looking for different behaviors and how it acts Uh, there's differences in how they look"
"10123330","10127450"," if it's a male if it's short covering is one thing Then you've got like a melt up."
"10127470","10133950"," You've got like a short covering with um You got short covering with calls coming into the market"
"10133950","10141550"," and real money buying coming in the market uh Uh And you'll start to see the squeezing higher You"
"10141550","10142650"," it won't come back."
"10143030","10148350"," You won't see and then there's then it was a melt up cut type of calls coming to the market"
"10148350","10151690"," Then there's the squeezing hire Uh, and they all look different. "
"10152030","10157110"," So right now all i'm seeing is short covering i'm not seeing a bid come into the market as shorts"
"10157110","10172990"," are covering currently You'd see much faster movement If it was a buy program You"
"10172990","10184560"," Look at that in video Support"
"10184560","10188500"," it to 100 to 10 to 20 looks a lot like the tesla chart, right?"
"10189360","10199190"," Not too much difference from the tesla chart You guys"
"10199190","10208170"," heard the news about uh, was it neon Ukraine offer or is the only or the most neon mining for"
"10208170","10223140"," chip production comes out of uh, ukraine We'll"

"10233110","10238790"," down lower you'd want to see that break below 230 Looks like uh major support though at 200."
"10238910","10243410"," That's a nice number Not a lot but not a big move down for nvidia."
"10243690","10251730"," It's just set some by alerts on your charting program for 220 90 Again at 211 20 And let the"
"10251730","10259110"," market wherever to sell down deeply start looking at 201 36 to buy a dip on No, that it gets"
"10259110","10268870"," that low You want to see a price target above if you're super duper bush"
"10268870","10279950"," on nvidia Sky is the limit right Real"
"10279950","10292730"," sellers above uh 290 Some"
"10292730","10304020"," sellers at 240 Where we are right now Nice buy program going on right now on nvidia I"
"10304020","10324650"," never see like puts on nvidia rarely some but not a lot always calls lots calls on nvidia Uh, so"
"10324650","10332570"," why the question is um, thanks, Jason So how Justin kenny's asking how can you tell if there's a"
"10332570","10333070"," buy program?"
"10333910","10338270"," That's a very good question So we're going to talk about that right now. "
"10338470","10343130"," We're going to be looking for right Uh, so how do we tell if there's a buy program on the"
"10343130","10343710"," spy, right?"
"10347540","10361080"," Thanks right here So"
"10361080","10365900"," there's a few things i'm looking for right so Uh, so currently where we are right now, right?"
"10366660","10371960"," We hit this bottom down below at 426 61 and then we tapped it a second time and we reversed"
"10371960","10372800"," course right?"
"10373740","10379220"," So right when that happens, uh The first thing that i'm thinking about is if someone was short"
"10379220","10381120"," where are they going to take profit?"
"10381800","10383400"," Uh, so that's my first step, right?"
"10383980","10386940"," Uh, so we're looking down below we're in this other channel down below."
"10387040","10387900"," It's actually lower."
"10388080","10397860"," It's like 425 84 Uh, and that's going back it's going back somewhere"
"10399940","10404720"," I posted this chart on Uh twitter earlier today, right?"
"10404860","10406220"," But we're looking at some support down here. "
"10406320","10414280"," Let's say at 426 65 The lower end is somewhere in between there and 424 There should be a uh,"
"10414320","10421060"," a test there, right or some form of support there and so Uh, the first thing you're looking for is"
"10421060","10421540"," a bounce, right?"
"10421680","10426760"," We've got a bounce You're going to see anyone that was short the market heading into the open here"
"10426760","10429540"," or from the open They're going to take some profit here, right?"
"10429700","10434760"," So they're going to close their shorts out of the market So the first thing you'll see is a slow"
"10434760","10441440"," reversal The next thing that you're going to be looking for are Or I look for is inside of the"
"10441440","10446560"," dome over here on the right hand side And i'm going to look for not just you won't see just"
"10446560","10450120"," let's say 30 A thousand orders 40,000 orders."
"10450360","10455860"," You'd see like a hundred thousand orders You'd see like 120,000 orders, right?"
"10456280","10462380"," If you're only seeing like orders of like 50 60,000 And the sellers kind of disappear above you end"
"10462380","10466940"," up seeing like only 20,000 sellers 10,000 sellers But if you see if you start to see like"
"10466940","10474960"," 100,000 sellers 120,000 sellers 180,000 sellers 200,000 sellers I'm going to be looking for not"
"10474960","10478320"," only short covering but a squeeze the star right there, right?"
"10478740","10485740"," And then I want to continue to see the equity buyers stay aggressive down below I want to see a"
"10485740","10493080"," sharp move higher Right like one green giant bar going straight up for let's say 2030 handles And"
"10493080","10497720"," then I want to see a continuation of that and then I also want to see a waterfall of calls"
"10497720","10500760"," of call buying Large call buying."
"10501320","10508760"," I want to see it At the ask not the bid I want to see them in blocks from large"
"10508760","10513480"," institutional buyers and from banks and hedge funds And I want them to see I want to see them"
"10513480","10515800"," outside of the money Not in the money. "
"10515880","10517420"," I'm like down here at 426."
"10517900","10523600"," I don't want to see call buyers buying You know like single date or three date or five-day calls"
"10523600","10528240"," that are right in the money 426 C's I don't want to see that I want to see like weekly"
"10528240","10535360"," monthly three month out calls that are way outside the money like Especially back in 2020's 2021"
"10535360","10540920"," when you'd see these rallies you'd see the waterfall of calls coming in you'd see shorts covering"
"10540920","10547160"," And you'd see an expansion to the upside you'd see it out let you see calls come in safe Any"
"10547160","10553860"," other time last two years you would see calls coming in for 440 450s and 460s immediately You'd see"
"10553860","10560200"," them dated a week a month and three months out And you'd see a cascade waterfall of that combined"
"10560200","10566780"," with with large equity buying right So when you're seeing shorts covering large scale equity buying"
"10566780","10572540"," that doesn't relent And you see a waterfall of calls that are outside the money expanding the the"
"10572540","10578140"," rate the trading range Then you coupled all three of those coupled along with the short covering"
"10578140","10584800"," aspect as one you'll see you'll actually see the The market just start green barring it up trade"
"10584800","10591240"," sideways and down slightly green bar it up trade sideways and down slightly And furthermore, I can"
"10591240","10596060"," also tell you when you see a difference between short covering and a melt up or a squeeze iron You"
"10596060","10600600"," you you ever get left behind and you're like I wanted to buy calls Who just give me a second"
"10600600","10604260"," to buy calls just give me a second to buy calls I swear i'm going to buy in and you"
"10604260","10609040"," see us go up 70 points hundred points in one day Now that's how you know that you're in a"
"10609040","10614980"," melt up That's how you know that you're in a large short covering squeeze higher with big money"
"10614980","10623720"," coming into the market So you it's so this started back at 1130 right It's 1208 if this was a"
"10623720","10633360"," normal if this was a normal buy operation Buy let's say one o'clock at the latest latest latest you"
"10633360","10639840"," would see us up 70 to 100 handles And then we trade sideways for an hour or two Right you"
"10639840","10643920"," usually trade sideways for an hour or two we get another rip into the close So you want to see"
"10643920","10647700"," that immediate turnaround It's almost considered a V shape recovery."
"10647900","10653000"," Sometimes it's a crown recovery You want to see that big move big powerful move in the market. "
"10653140","10658700"," So when you're not seeing that It doesn't mean no trade higher just means that this isn't real"
"10658700","10659720"," money coming into the market."
