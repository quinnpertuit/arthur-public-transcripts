"242810","248310"," Elon in high positions for many many years since the beginning believe it or not."
"248370","253290"," So I got to disclose that right away but I am more more soberish."
"253290","259649"," I think I have a different opinion about Tesla the inside opinion from people that not Tesla very"
"259649","263430"," or you know like we have the fan boy and then you got people that have worked for for Elon"
"263430","264270"," for a long, long time. "
"264490","264670"," Okay."
"265490","269350"," So off this open we are squeezing higher to close the gap above."
"270010","277650"," We're going to close 394 52 394 13 and then we have some other places to tag above as well"
"277650","279330"," and spy some places of interest. "
"280190","286570"," Include 39484 okay now I did I did put two little H lines above here."
"287230","291090"," And we're going to look for at least 39484."
"292090","298030"," So we'll put a PT above there at some point we should tag that 39484 right here. "
"299650","301730"," Just so you have access to it."
"301730","309910"," And I'm leaving up yesterday's leaving up yesterday's chart because I left you with this red bar"
"309910","315090"," down below in this yellow bar right here right I said you'd said what do you expect for tomorrow."
"315670","319450"," And I gave you an expectation for today right. "
"320070","327570"," And that's kind of where we traded here and spy although there the in the overnight hours just be"
"327570","328670"," aware that down here."
"329510","333690"," Is a pivot point that's not that's not seen right now."
"334110","340750"," And that's that three I believe it's at 39149 39150 I think if you do account for ES okay so"
"340750","341870"," just be aware of this one here. "
"342470","346430"," And then we'll do this morning is we're going to do our levels together."
"347110","348710"," We're going to then go over Tesla."
"349890","358010"," We're going to go over the S&P 500 ES spy and specifically about a post that I made. "
"358010","361870"," Early this morning I was woken up in the middle of the night last night."
"362510","365750"," With an alert so I've got I've got these alerts that are set."
"367210","370990"," To wake me up if anything ever happens middle of the night something terrible or bad. "
"371950","372510"," Happens."
"372770","374810"," Remember I was talking a binky yesterday."
"375630","379290"," After the bell and he's a long time market participant. "
"379970","382770"," And myself I've had some experience with."
"383710","389510"," I've had some experience with market changing events that you can't account for."
"390310","394790"," And that's what I have those alerts set for right so if something happens in the overnight that you"
"394790","395250"," see happen. "
"395730","400930"," And you need to wake up no matter what to account for those right you guys follow me I follow"
"400930","402530"," you guys with big community so I'm like."
"403510","406950"," You know why are you waking three o'clock in the morning well because they got woken up."
"409050","414210"," Because we traded below the weekly and monthly trigger in the middle of the night not something you"
"414210","415290"," want to see happen. "
"416070","419850"," So this is the PT right here we're going to do our levels together this morning."
"420950","423790"," And we're going to we have some major things to talk about today okay."
"424970","427170"," Some some pretty big things that we have to discuss. "
"427870","430450"," We have to discuss Tesla we have to discuss tech."
"431350","436170"," We have to discuss the rotation out of S down or out of the Dow right you saw me on"
"436170","437990"," on that captain's office say."
"438390","439730"," Take a hedge on the Dow. "
"440510","443230"," And so take a hedge on the Dow why do you take a hedge on the Dow."
"443710","449890"," Because it's the most pumped up index right now the Dow held up this morning but you saw the Dow."
"450330","454870"," Was getting hit probably the most right if you look at the if you look at January February. "
"456650","462550"," The only thing that's taken a hit is the Dow because that we rotated first into the Dow right."
"463110","470110"," And they rotated over into XLC and XLY and XLK you saw that post on on that captain's off or"
"470110","470550"," I said."
"470890","474190"," Remember in January I said I said just be open to this. "
"475150","481250"," That these these sub sectors of the S&P 500 have been have been beaten down for two years."
"481250","486310"," Some of them are down 48% 36% they will make a market any out of anything if they"
"486310","486570"," can."
"487190","492310"," So you're going to look for rotation into that and we got rotation into that December in January. "
"493270","497930"," And now we're in February February and you're seeing more rotation in the market."
"498550","504110"," This morning I'm watching oil I'm like hey are they rotating into oil I know oil was at zero last"
"504110","504430"," week."
"504430","510630"," Is that where they're rotating into just trying to keep an eye on where the rotation is in the"
"510630","511049"," market. "
"511409","516549"," Now with all that blah blah blah the way you guys really don't care about that."
"516690","522909"," What you guys are caring about is why are we signaling some major lows in the market."
"523650","529750"," You want to know why that's being signaled and how and how do you prepare for that happening. "
"530270","535150"," Now these are two events that have taken place since February 16th."
"536410","541490"," We had a trigger on the 16th we had a trigger on the 26th I think for the for end"
"541490","541850"," of month."
"542010","547210"," You guys were here with me in this live stream on Friday not Friday I keep saying Friday and"
"547210","547370"," Monday. "
"547910","553330"," But on the 28th all day long I even typed up every number and said I'm looking for these numbers"
"553330","553830"," right here."
"554410","556330"," I need to know if they get underneath them."
"556330","560390"," And I think some of you are like he's crazy this guy is what the fuck he's talking about. "
"561050","566910"," It's gamut it's call walls and put walls and it's this and it's that and I'm like no no no"
"566910","567010"," no."
"567730","572690"," I'm like these these fucking these professionals are looking for specific numbers."
"574010","580250"," If they can tag them they're gonna and what do we do we stuck around until the last minute of"
"580250","582230"," end of month and they got them didn't they. "
"582230","587290"," And then they got a map that the ones that they didn't hit they hit in after hours they went"
"587290","592210"," after them and eat the numbers they wound up tagging later and later in the night time."
"592850","597210"," And they were important they're important for these computers and algorithms and these professional"
"597210","600210"," traders out there to get those numbers."
"600850","606870"," And so what happened was we didn't we didn't secure for a waiting for 10. "
"607210","614570"," We didn't stay above the weekly and monthly triggers and we damaged that support the market."
"615250","621050"," And then last night we traded below that support the market which is dangerous and it's setting up"
"621050","627670"," something above from here that is that is looming in the background at this point."
"627670","637250"," And we talked about it and said that there is a trade developing to pull back in the market off"
"637250","638530"," of the daily trigger. "
"640170","645130"," And so we're gonna do I'm gonna set up these levels for you and then we're gonna do is we're"
"645130","647850"," going we're going to look at that daily trigger and where is it."
"648830","650990"," Where is it in relation to right here."
"652930","655510"," Where is it currently where is it coming down. "
"656070","662030"," What would the interplay and results of that that daily trigger be an expected path."
"662690","667050"," And then it's what price is likely going to go back to the daily trigger."
"667590","675110"," Before down to check on the weekly and monthly and then we'll know then at that point does the"
"675110","676810"," market start begin to sell down. "
"677370","681330"," So we're going to pay attention to this as it unfolds today tomorrow."
"681330","687770"," It shouldn't fold today and tomorrow into Monday and we'll have a clear picture but you don't want"
"687770","689250"," to be you don't be caught I guess."
"690510","692890"," Veritably holding your foot in your hand right. "
"694470","700510"," Or your elbow in your hand or your your baby fist in your hand or something and say hey I"
"700510","703830"," didn't see this coming ahead and we want to be prepared for this."
"704540","711310"," This includes Tesla tech stocks and includes the S&P 500 so you need to be aware of it as"
"711310","714490"," it's developing and I'll show you a previous example of this happening."
"714950","721530"," There is one positive thing for bulls have going for them though on the under the surface. "
"722350","727550"," The weekly and monthly velocity is looking very dangerous for bulls."
"728390","734090"," And when we look at the other underlying weekly and monthly velocity it is looking a lot like I got"
"734090","736850"," to be honest with you it's looking a lot like December of 2021."
"738170","743270"," So we have to be careful of that okay they're selling in or they're selling into buyers right now"
"743270","750150"," in this market and we're losing the floor of the market without it being seen price is not showing"
"750150","750590"," it yet. "
"751230","756450"," And so we have to be we have paid special attention to it and then in the next coming days"
"756450","759750"," okay and so this isn't like a crash prediction or anything like that."
"759850","763330"," As a matter of fact I was talking with a friend that this morning at 5 a.m. or 4"
"763330","769630"," a.m. And then it's not you know you got to remember price from yesterday in the yesterday's program"
"769630","773970"," I kept saying to you price is important because the goalposts continually get moved."
"775070","780750"," Now 3300 might seem bad to you but I'm like hey I just bought 345 not too long ago. "
"781250","786170"," 330 is not too bad it's 50 it's 150 points lower that's like a two days of fading for us."
"786770","792050"," I'm like we do that shit in two days back and forth up and down so that's not too bad"
"792050","797410"," of a of a of a down move and if that is the Mike Wilson last leg not so bad"
"797410","798670"," right if we do get that low."
"799290","805630"," It's not so bad overall but you've been prepared for it if it does happen it produces itself and"
"805630","807870"," we'll do this morning we'll take a look at all that kind of stuff. "
"808890","812690"," So first of all the point for today is 39494."
"815030","818230"," 39494 right down here and then shocker."
"819970","822710"," It's right where this PT is right here okay. "
"822710","829730"," I want you to see that the importance of that this morning that 39494 right in there."
"830490","833990"," Trying to close the gap above here we got a small H line down below."
"834430","839830"," We tagged this first H line right here so we'll get rid of that one first H line achieved. "
"840610","843370"," We've got S1 this morning is 39318."
"845410","847070"," Let me see here 393."
"848970","857490"," Where's that 39318 right down right there that's S1. "
"858630","865770"," And Tesla you saw this morning retracing to be expected of course and that was an opposed that"
"865770","867690"," posted on public Twitter last night."
"867690","872470"," Was that you can't make a decision at this point about what Tesla is going to do."
"873110","876470"," So we've got a second support is 39163. "
"877530","879630"," And I'll load that one is down here."
"882550","888450"," Right down here and this is where that this is where that secret PS pivot point is."
"889090","892710"," And then below that we've got 389 way down here. "
"894590","897710"," 3987 right here that's three for the market."
"898030","904730"," And then for the up to the upside of the market here we've got 39649."
"908810","911050"," Check that one right there there's your R1. "
"912310","919770"," And then we've got 39649 right and then I've got a 39825 right up here."
"921370","922970"," That one up there that's our two."
"924470","926510"," And I'm not shocked at this one either. "
"926730","929910"," I think that this next one here is not going to be shocking."
"930170","936110"," It's not 39980 with the importance of this one is going to become apparent to you in just a moment."
"939310","940270"," Excuse me. "
"941230","945490"," Yeah, this one's going to become important to you in just a moment here."
"946750","949330"," So we've got all of your levels for today."
"950010","955730"," We're going to quickly look at the spy here. "
"955870","957950"," I'm going to put it on a large time frame for you."
"958470","962350"," I'm going to put this on just a second here two hour."
"963910","965830"," One day maybe this will be better. "
"966550","970570"," And we're going to talk about this right here."
"971830","972930"," Just a second here."
"973010","976910"," I'm going to show you guys this in the background so you can see it. "
"980220","981680"," Maybe it's better on an hourly."
"982620","987540"," Let me see if I can get this in a better shot on a four hour maybe."
"989020","989900"," Probably better. "
"991440","992860"," Four hours where it's at."
"998530","999010"," Okay."
"1000010","1001150"," Just a second here. "
"1006850","1009290"," See if I can pick this up from one."
"1019320","1020160"," Change this here."
"1020500","1024480"," Right there. "
"1026200","1027339"," We're going to look at an hourly chart."
"1029140","1031280"," Okay, so we're going to get the spy real quick."
"1031300","1033800"," There's a couple of things we need to look at here. "
"1036180","1038240"," This is the spy, all right."
"1039880","1042579"," And I want to be clear with you on something here."
"1043540","1046339"," The next few days are going to be quite important. "
"1048220","1051960"," I want you to keep your eyes on this yellow line right here."
"1052100","1053940"," This is the daily trigger here."
"1056020","1057980"," And we don't want to get underneath. "
"1058360","1059940"," Well, we are underneath this daily trigger."
"1063780","1065160"," Trend is on the hourly."
"1065720","1066660"," But the daily is important. "
"1066900","1067860"," This is like watching."
"1075460","1077360"," This is major trend in the market."
"1077560","1079160"," This yellow line is major trend. "
"1079320","1083400"," If you follow this yellow line, you'll see major trend over multiple timeframes."
"1083400","1087160"," If you're like the cam looking for a weekly trade or a monthly trade or a three month trade,"
"1087540","1091080"," anything like that, you'll see that this yellow line is very critical to that."
"1091500","1096920"," You can see that we get very, very violent reactions on the up and down side. "
"1097720","1102780"," You can see that when we trade below this yellow line, that can be very negative, right?"
"1102780","1106100"," Come back up and we get another reaction down here, right?"
"1106280","1108020"," And the down side is pretty, pretty dangerous."
"1108640","1114420"," Same thing when we're fighting on the way back up, you'll see that you can also see trend reversal"
"1114420","1116400"," within this yellow line."
"1116400","1119240"," You'll see a bottom forming and the break above. "
"1119600","1120760"," You see the break above here."
"1121180","1123220"," Major move to a new high, right?"
"1123340","1124280"," I think this was last summer."
"1125180","1126320"," We blew faces off. "
"1126860","1129900"," I think that, yeah, this was the June, July run that we had last summer."
"1130740","1134060"," And then, of course, you see that yellow line on the down side here."
"1135020","1140520"," Now, this doesn't mean we're definitely going down here, but I do want you to be aware of this"
"1140520","1141400"," forming, okay?"
"1141940","1144620"," And there was some concern here into February. "
"1145340","1148140"," You can see the yellow line run it right now, okay?"
"1148900","1158640"," And I said to you earlier in February that the bulls of this market wanted to trade into February"
"1158640","1159540"," right here."
"1160760","1163860"," That the bulls wanted to trade above this daily, okay?"
"1164260","1167440"," It's very, very important for bulls to get up here."
"1167600","1169420"," It was, see that 408 right there?"
"1170480","1176460"," You know, they want to claim this 404, but then get above the 408 so they can have some push"
"1176460","1177140"," off, right?"
"1177760","1180120"," This is very bullish for bulls, but it is. "
"1180720","1183660"," It means it's telling you that the market is going higher."
"1184520","1186280"," It's telling you that the way is up."
"1187860","1191820"," And it's going to, it's going to, it's showing you the way, no matter what anyone is saying"
"1191820","1196600"," publicly, it's telling you the way it's telling you, if you're a bear out there, it's telling you,"
"1196640","1199720"," look, man, we're probably going to 43460 up there, okay?"
"1200580","1206220"," The path of, when you talk about supply and demand, the path of least resistance, and then how much"
"1206220","1209460"," are we going to make for money there is important as well, right?"
"1209460","1214660"," Maybe we don't know that we're going higher to 430 and 460, that we're going to go up 300, 400"
"1214660","1217640"," points, and so you want to see this develop. "
"1218040","1221020"," And we didn't see that develop into the 28."
"1221400","1230660"," Instead, what we saw was south side on this market, get us underneath, we'll start to smash into,"
"1230900","1233820"," we actually successfully defended the weekly and monthly."
"1234720","1236880"," Right here, we had a successful defense of it. "
"1236880","1240020"," You wanted to see us, the market go up right here and end the month."
"1240240","1241100"," That's what you wanted to see."
"1241500","1242560"," We didn't see that. "
"1242720","1246940"," We saw was a breakdown of the weekly and monthly trigger."
"1247560","1252460"," And in actually, in all actuality, and last night's overnight, we got underneath it here."
"1253540","1255400"," So this is not good news either. "
"1256200","1262180"," And what it's doing is, it's, it's, what it's doing is, we've, we've, to damage the support in the"
"1262180","1262480"," market."
"1263280","1267680"," And it's given an opportunity and time for the daily trigger to make a reversal here."
"1268620","1271120"," And this is where the danger comes into the market. "
"1271500","1271680"," Okay."
"1271900","1275520"," This is where I'm now watching this, this come down here."
"1276460","1281540"," And what I don't want to see is this violent move down, this velocity move to the downside. "
"1282020","1288600"," Now in an intraday chart right now, today, tomorrow, we've got an ISM on Friday stuff like that."
"1288900","1290180"," We've got the weekend coming up."
"1290180","1295540"," I'm going to expect at least this test of this between now and then. "
"1295700","1300380"," That's how it ran 401, 401 80, I believe is the exact number for today."
"1301060","1304220"," So just looking at this number for today, it's 401 28."
"1305200","1305280"," Okay. "
"1305460","1309560"," So 401 28, it's going to continue to come screaming down on top of us."
"1310260","1315960"," So the idea here would be that we're either going to break above this daily trigger or we're going"
"1315960","1317180"," to reject off of it."
"1317720","1319360"," We already know the weekly and the monthly. "
"1319960","1321380"," Are weak right now."
"1321680","1327820"," So the point here is being is so that you're prepared and watching us start to crash through the"
"1327820","1328600"," support level."
"1329080","1331300"," Is going to be looking for that test. "
"1332180","1332540"," Right."
"1333000","1337300"," And if we get sent back down here and break through this weekly and monthly, we're going down."
"1337860","1338780"," Does that make sense?"
"1340040","1341900"," And what you don't want us or you can't. "
"1342000","1342780"," This is fine here."
"1342800","1343700"," We do something like this."
"1344500","1349340"," Right sideways market and then start to head higher. "
"1349360","1350220"," I'm all for this."
"1350240","1353980"," If we get good news, but you need to be aware."
"1354340","1358600"," I need you to be aware out there that this this rolling over here. "
"1358620","1360400"," We we have examples of this."
"1360920","1363440"," We have examples of this in previous experience."
"1363440","1368380"," And later on in the program, I'll show you the weekly and monthly being eroded right now. "
"1368960","1371300"," And prior examples of that happening here."
"1371340","1375660"," But you can see when we get that role started in here."
"1376780","1379940"," We can be fast, like super fast. "
"1380200","1382200"," You can see the way to see it right here."
"1382360","1382440"," Right."
"1382940","1385320"," Up here you slam off and that's it. "
"1385320","1385880"," It's on."
"1386420","1390280"," Now if we come up here and we reject off this daily and start coming down here."
"1390700","1392100"," It's not going to be fucking pretty. "
"1392360","1395020"," It's going to be fast, violent, and it won't take long."
"1395780","1397220"," So you have to be aware of that."
"1397500","1400340"," When I talk to bulls about Tesla and all of tech. "
"1401040","1402980"," I tell them this is the no Ditto zone in here."
"1403140","1403200"," Right."
"1403300","1404560"," You're not messing around in here. "
"1404560","1409820"," You need to get above price needs to get above this daily trigger and start to make it's way higher"
"1409820","1411760"," for you to take a long and safety."
"1412240","1415940"," If you are long here already, you have to have a hedge on the market."
"1416360","1421540"," We've talked about taking June, March, not only April, but March and April. "
"1421820","1425440"," Estile shorts or long calls triple average or dirt cheap."
"1426500","1428780"," Find to find something that can protect yourself."
"1429560","1432360"," If you're long in here, but this is not the place to be taking along either. "
"1433240","1435800"," Because this market could go violently down."
"1435940","1439540"," And if you're just out there holding your your foot in your hand, you're going to get you're going"
"1439540","1440100"," to get fucked up."
"1440240","1441120"," That's how it happens. "
"1442140","1444380"," This is how you get fucked up in the market right here."
"1444960","1446740"," The same thing goes for bears too."
"1447320","1450020"," You shouldn't be short in this open in any way shape or form. "
"1450300","1452520"," If you're a bear, what you're looking for is the setup."
"1453100","1453540"," Right."
"1453780","1458760"," What is the setup if you're a bear and the setup is a teeing off of this yellow line right"
"1458760","1459020"," here. "
"1459660","1463100"," So currently for today, it's at 40123."
"1463600","1465940"," You're looking for a tee off on this, right."
"1466520","1468160"," You're looking for that kind of a tee off. "
"1468400","1473320"," You're looking for this velocity to come down upon and break through and take price with it"
"1473320","1475160"," underneath right down here."
"1475240","1479360"," Does that make sense for some targets on the low down here."
"1479840","1480980"," The first one. "
"1481800","1483200"," There's there's two of them actually."
"1483440","1483920"," There's one here."
"1484040","1485120"," I believe at three eighty seven. "
"1485120","1491780"," The next big one that's very important below that though is going to be a weekly moving average."
"1492040","1492960"," You can search for it."
"1493420","1496520"," You can search for it on your own and just type in weekly moving average. "
"1497900","1498880"," It's right there."
"1499700","1503980"," And you can just put this on yourself and you'll see that it's hovering down below."
"1504900","1506620"," And we tagged that weekly moving average. "
"1506780","1512640"," The very important moving average historically on stock charts going back years and years and years"
"1512640","1512980"," and years."
"1512980","1515760"," And you'll be looking for that first tag down below."
"1515960","1516640"," This is a three. "
"1516800","1519100"," I think there's three to a post on that captain's alpha."
"1519540","1524020"," And you get the least this one down below here to be checking out as like a PT two."
"1525160","1532360"," And then I did a bunch of FIB levels down below from there leading all the way down to 3 "
"1532360","1532680",",300. "
"1533600","1537040"," And that's where the next real out below the monthly support."
"1537220","1538440"," The next one is the three month support."
"1538520","1539820"," So that's that's where that one is. "
"1539980","1541880"," You can check that out on that captain's alpha."
"1541880","1547020"," If you don't follow me there, you just request to follow me there and I'll approve you and you can"
"1547020","1552960"," get in there and look at the details of how this trade sets itself up."
"1554200","1556040"," Okay, so you need to be aware of this. "
"1556180","1558780"," You can see this rolling down in the end of month down here."
"1558880","1561100"," This is not this is not good for bulls."
"1562460","1564500"," We talked about this and that happens up. "
"1564680","1565340"," We get above here."
"1565660","1566580"," It's not good for bears."
"1567340","1570220"," And right now as it's showing itself, it's not good for bulls. "
"1570900","1572740"," Now the next one we're going to look at is Tesla."
"1574820","1579300"," You guys, it's weird because people are like, you know, should I take a, should I take a long now"
"1579300","1579820"," on Tesla?"
"1580440","1582060"," I'm like, no, you should have taken 100."
"1582360","1583040"," That's what you take. "
"1583560","1585640"," I posted this on Tesla last night."
"1586480","1590180"," And I talked to people about this about this cluster that's forming over here."
"1590220","1593600"," We got the weekly, the hourly five minute, the one minute and the daily. "
"1594820","1595220"," Okay."
"1596060","1599240"," And people said to me yesterday in streams, where should I buy Tesla?"
"1599240","1606360"," And I said, I said yesterday, I said 187, I think I said, that's where I would buy Tesla."
"1607460","1612940"," And sure enough, we opened and defended 187 this morning on Tesla, right?"
"1613340","1614800"," It didn't break right away. "
"1615500","1619000"," And this was a place to buy the market right off the bell this morning."
"1619080","1627240"," You can see that there was a buy point here and you've got momentum turning down though on Tesla."
"1627840","1635880"," Right here at, excuse me, 196.04. And what we need to see happen here is consolidation. "
"1638460","1639700"," Oh, hold on a second here."
"1650800","1652920"," I'm losing some power here in the background."
"1653240","1654680"," I don't know what's going on. "
"1656300","1658120"," I'm losing power in the background."
"1659260","1661440"," I don't know quite why I'm losing power here."
"1661600","1662160"," Hold on a second. "
"1663980","1668200"," So the key here is that Tesla has some work to do."
"1669040","1671920"," Tesla has to, Tesla has to consolidate."
"1672780","1679680"," And you saw, you saw, this is most of tech is the same, most of the tech has the same"
"1679680","1680560"," issue right now. "
"1681280","1686240"," As we come into, I'm going to show you this blue line and how it matters for Tesla and why"
"1686240","1687260"," it matters for Tesla."
"1688780","1695980"," What the importance of it for Tesla and why does it matter for Tesla."
"1698040","1701700"," And I'm going to show you on a larger time frame why it matters for Tesla. "
"1701860","1703880"," Let me go to a year chart Tesla here."
"1706440","1710240"," And I want you to see this, I want you to see this yellow line, the same thing, right?"
"1710440","1711920"," We trended down on this yellow line."
"1712040","1716660"," We sold down off of it, came back up, portrayed it above the yellow line, came back down. "
"1716660","1719640"," And we actually bounced off this light blue line right here."
"1720220","1726420"," Everyone thought, yeah, correction is over on Tesla, blasted it back higher and then rolled it down"
"1726420","1727620"," with that daily, right?"
"1727860","1730580"," Just smashed it down onto the weekly moving average."
"1731200","1732740"," And right now it's here again. "
"1732960","1734660"," See this big blue line right here."
"1735280","1744840"," Once we got, once price got below this monthly trigger here, this monthly velocity, it became bad,"
"1745100","1745240"," right?"
"1745240","1747780"," We traded down to 100, right?"
"1748020","1750840"," So these sellers know this."
"1751240","1754640"," We talked about this in stream the past couple of weeks. "
"1755100","1759900"," We were coming up into 220 in stream, I said to you."
"1762100","1764880"," I said to you, I don't care if you know this or not."
"1765820","1771100"," I said, but I can assure you that there are professionals out there that are going to be keyed up"
"1771100","1771700"," to sell. "
"1773780","1776000"," Keyed up to sell on this blue line up here."
"1776120","1778420"," They're probably going to come in below 220."
"1778780","1781300"," They're going to get, you know, they're going to be like, hey, I'm selling right now. "
"1781320","1782120"," I'm not waiting for 220."
"1782220","1787320"," I'm going to start selling 216 and we started selling 217 at that point."
"1788240","1789540"," You saw it right here, right?"
"1791180","1799680"," These are these are a lot of sellers. "
"1799680","1804960"," The other thing is above to finish this, finish this corrective nature in this action."
"1805660","1810560"," If you don't, if you don't, if you can't, if the correction is not over in Tesla, we're going to"
"1810560","1812780"," find out because we've got one."
"1813520","1819540"," The yellow line, the green line, the white line and the orange line to act as. "
"1820460","1825600"," strength to break through to attempt to break through this blue line right here and now with with"
"1825600","1832960"," all these triggers these five triggers if they don't have the strength to break through negative"
"1832960","1837460"," velocity and the monthly on Tesla we're gonna continue our way down we're gonna we're gonna"
"1837460","1846900"," continue down and find that $62 so on this public post on Twitter on Jim Jim James my point here"
"1846900","1851940"," was I'm gonna show us the point here was that this is gonna have to consolidate right you see this"
"1851940","1858720"," consolidation taking place in here no you're not breaking above sorry and you're gonna have to"
"1858720","1865360"," consolidate strength there to at least attempt to make a trade higher in the trade I've said this"
"1865360","1873760"," multiple times the trade long in Tesla is not until you break above currently it stands at 220"
"1873760","1882340"," not you can't even take a new long in Tesla unless we break above 220 and consolidate it's actually"
"1882340","1888500"," consolidates and then take make another leg higher in the market so if you're going from a bull run"
"1888500","1895520"," to a bull market you need to break above 220 consolidate and then start to make another leg higher"
"1895520","1902320"," make sense otherwise there's no trade in Tesla as a bull you're actually looking to just buy 95"
"1902320","1907860"," bucks where the where the last gap is down the first gap that never got closed down here and"
"1907860","1914300"," believe it or not down lower now there is a target at $62 down here let's show it to this"
"1914300","1920040"," chart right now but there's a there's a there's a velocity trigger down below here at 62 bucks"
"1920040","1927100"," where we're not surprisingly is another gap so 62 bucks is that next target you've got two places"
"1927100","1932780"," to check down below here now I'll tell you what tell you what price gets below this yellow line"
"1932780","1939860"," right we're back to the yellow line again if price gets below this yellow line right here it's not"
"1939860","1947000"," a good looking yell that's like a puke it's like a puke yellow isn't it kind of nasty if price"
"1947000","1952300"," gets below the yellow line and you start you start to see that roll down and you start to see"
"1952300","1957960"," the weekly or the monthly velocity come down on top right here right it ain't gonna be pretty start"
"1957960","1964040"," seeing price trade down here and start seeing this price come down here and that's not gonna be fun"
"1964040","1969140"," I promise you you'll probably get a bounce right here and then you'll slam right off there and"
"1969140","1973700"," there goes your 65 bucks down there you don't want to get caught in this not should not heads they"
"1973700","1978880"," promise you if you're a bull you're you could try to buy this and try to buy this down here"
"1978880","1984220"," or you're trying to buy this up here but you're not fucking around in here you can day trade this"
"1984220","1989000"," shit if you want for this attempt you want if you want to day trade this move higher that's fine"
"1989000","1995540"," but you can't be out there publicly being like I'm a good I'm a bull here we're bullish is we're"
"1995540","2001060"," bullish crazy right here it's too dangerous for you to be like full port and this kind of stuff in"
"2001060","2006020"," here it absolutely is you want a full port this I understand you want a full port this down here"
"2006020","2011160"," understand all that when you're trying to pull port this kind of stuff it's just nonsense doesn't"
"2011160","2016360"," mean it doesn't mean anything and for bears if you're a Tesla bear out there what are you looking"
"2016360","2023220"," for you're looking for a break of price you're looking priced to get underneath this yellow line"
"2023220","2028940"," right here and for this blue line to come down this is that bearish crossover that bears are"
"2028940","2037400"," looking for to to leg into a move lower believe it or not so bears need to see bears need"
"2037400","2045480"," to see a break below 189 36 need to see a break below one ready a break below and hold"
"2045480","2055380"," 189 36 and they need weekly velocity to come over and join daily velocity and start"
"2055380","2060139"," start making a move in the downside there is one more thing to be just keeping an eye on down"
"2060139","2067219"," here and that's that weekly trigger that's that 171 22 so there's two legs in here for bears they"
"2067219","2074739"," need well three legs they need to get down below here consolidate break below 172 so you get your"
"2074739","2080560"," first leg right here your second leg is down to recheck a double bottom on 100 probably close the"
"2080560","2086840"," gap at 95 to be exact if we break through that like it's butter your third leg down is going"
"2086840","2093340"," to be the $62 and that would be the market coming with Tesla would actually see the market probably"
"2093340","2098400"," trade down to 3300 or something like that it would but more than likely look like that now"
"2098400","2103400"," sometimes Tesla can disconnect from the rest of the market but I would expect that if Tesla's gonna"
"2103400","2108140"," try to see 62 bucks in more than likely gonna see the market try to try to make a new"
"2108140","2113540"," low at some point alongside it okay so that there's Tesla for you so there's no there's no like"
"2113540","2119680"," there's no like yeah Tesla's going to do this or not do that I expect my expectation as Tesla's"
"2119680","2126300"," going to attempt to at least test this this blue line it's gonna get up there it's gonna get up"

"3451460","3456140"," And what you see is me in my trading journey publicly."
"3456840","3458660"," You see a three different sides to me. "
"3458780","3461260"," You see a shit posting."
"3462420","3465360"," Jim on Twitter with Jim James."
"3466180","3469880"," Then you see a serious side of me on at captain's alpha. "
"3470760","3475340"," And then you see my trading journey here on a live stream."
"3476440","3481800"," And you're never going to get the fake the fake Jim James."
"3483320","3484600"," Trading with you every day. "
"3484700","3492380"," It's it's one of the key pieces of a trader or investors journey that they seem to miss out on"
"3492380","3495360"," unless they're paying somebody 600 bucks a month."
"3496140","3502260"," For a private mentorship or a private live stream one day a week for four hours where they show up."
"3502660","3506280"," You know, they're like, I'll be there for four hours on a set day every week. "
"3506280","3511360"," And that was my big problem is is that I'm like, well, wait a minute here."
"3511480","3512580"," Well, I had two big problems."
"3513220","3514220"," I'm like, wait a minute here. "
"3514520","3519100"," I'm like, you're only going to be here on this set day every week when there's pivots all the time"
"3519100","3519580"," in the market."
"3520540","3524920"," Important pivots in the market where I want you there to teach me or at least be my partner that"
"3524920","3525660"," I can trade with."
"3526440","3530540"," You know, when you're trading alone, when I was trading alone without like you guys here with me,"
"3530540","3534220"," you guys actually help me be a better trader, a better investor. "
"3535660","3537540"," Because I'm with other people, right?"
"3537820","3539360"," I'm with you guys all day long."
"3540620","3542380"," And you're helping me to be a better trader."
"3542500","3546260"," I've got people to bounce my my ideas off of my opinions. "
"3547600","3548720"," That kind of stuff."
"3549240","3552880"," But at the same time when you have someone there with you on you when you're investing in trading,"
"3553140","3555740"," it's nice to have someone there with you."
"3555880","3561940"," And so I guess my point behind this is that there when I was trying to look for someone to"
"3561940","3562420"," trade with. "
"3563280","3565100"," Oftentimes it was like, pay me a bunch of money."
"3565700","3567480"," I'm only going to be there at these specific times."
"3568560","3571740"," And, you know, fuck you if you want to do you want to trade on a Monday on a shitty"
"3571740","3572020"," day. "
"3572320","3577480"," And I remember there was a time when, you know, I got a job and I can only trade on"
"3577480","3578040"," Tuesdays."
"3578720","3581140"," Well, right in Tuesdays like a shitty market day to be trading."
"3581620","3583900"," But I would be like, yeah, I'm trading it no matter what. "
"3584240","3585500"," And the alpha guy is not there."
"3586940","3588160"," So I'm like, damn it."
"3588280","3589960"," I'm not going to be available on a Friday. "
"3591220","3596920"," I'm not going to be there for Friday to when he's available."
"3597340","3602880"," So having like someone there to be with all day long Monday through Friday seems like it's an"
"3602880","3605260"," important thing for people's journey."
"3605340","3607320"," It was an important thing for me along in my journey. "
"3607760","3613040"," And what you're going to get in this is you're not going to get me trading well every day."
"3613240","3613980"," You're not going to get me."
"3614220","3616020"," You're going to see me fail in the market. "
"3616860","3621440"," Don't expect me to craft a persona where I'm perfect for you."
"3621740","3622900"," I'm not a human."
"3623680","3625520"," You're only ever going to get that from you. "
"3625580","3628700"," You're never going to see me as me."
"3628860","3629420"," It's weird."
"3629600","3633800"," I was talking to this guy where I was like, you know what they do is like they take both"
"3633800","3638220"," sides of the trade paper trade and then they take a screenshot of it. "
"3638700","3641000"," And they only post the winning side, right?"
"3641260","3644520"," So you see a flash of win, win, win, win, win."
"3644520","3646900"," And you're like, oh, that guy's always winning."
"3647400","3648360"," That's how they do it. "
"3648400","3650460"," That's how they run scams for you."
"3650680","3655620"," So if you're following me or hanging out with my community or this community that's built"
"3655620","3659940"," themselves, believe it or not, actually this community built themselves in a community, believe it"
"3659940","3660240"," or not."
"3661240","3665940"," When they disagree with me oftentimes you'll see in the discord people are like, I'm fucking fading"
"3665940","3668600"," the captain today or I'm fading the captain this whole month. "
"3668600","3670340"," I'm fine with that."
"3670480","3675060"," It's been one of our rules since the beginning is I don't care if you're a bull bear theta gang."
"3675240","3677980"," I don't care if you're in the market 20 years or one day. "
"3678740","3680500"," We're all here to we're all here to make money."
"3680700","3681520"," We're not here to fight each other."
"3681520","3688660"," We're here to fight the banks and we're not we're retailers trying to fight banks and hedge funds"
"3688660","3690300"," and all that kind of stuff. "
"3690540","3690620"," Right?"
"3690920","3691000"," So."
"3691860","3695660"," And you're never going to catch you never going to catch me being that guy you'll never ever catch"
"3695660","3702300"," me being that guy with like perfectly perfectly clean straight white teeth and I'll never show you"
"3702300","3702940"," a Lambo."
"3703380","3704840"," I've got a wife and two kids. "
"3705080","3709520"," I've got, you know, I've got a I've got a shitty sailboat that I try to keep floating."
"3710640","3714420"," So I've got all the normal things that you have in life and you'll never I've never been that"
"3714420","3715060"," person either."
"3715060","3724820"," You'll never see me out there like with flashing stuff and or or betraying myself as I thought"
"3724820","3725360"," about it. "
"3725480","3729560"," There was a time where I thought about a Lamborghini, but then I realized what the maintenance of"
"3729560","3733060"," that shit costs and how it's a depreciation dating asset and all that kind of stuff."
"3733060","3734760"," And but I'm not that guy."
"3735320","3738880"," I've been I've been I've been I've had the ability to possibly be that guy and I don't want to"
"3738880","3739500"," ever be that guy. "
"3739940","3746180"," And if you ever see me become that guy run because I don't ever want to be that person in"
"3746180","3746400"," life."
"3746760","3747580"," I don't want to lose my wife."
"3747800","3748580"," I don't lose my kids. "
"3749520","3752660"," I don't want to lose my friends that cared deeply for me."
"3753040","3755920"," And so, yeah, I'll never be that person."
"3756740","3758500"," And if I ever am call me out on it. "
"3758700","3760720"," You ever see me be that become that person in life."
"3761500","3762500"," Say something to me."
"3767760","3769220"," So, and thanks for joining us. "
"3769320","3774360"," This was mainly this is to a necklace, Nicholas Lovo."
"3775200","3777120"," So, thanks for thanks for joining the community man."
"3778720","3780820"," Please join up to your thing. "
"3782800","3783680"," And welcome."
"3788120","3794020"," Yeah, this group is awesome man is a you'll never if you ever find anybody stock pumping any scam"
"3794020","3795540"," pumpers you find them for me."
"3795540","3796280"," I'll go after him. "
"3796380","3802820"," You see any you see anything like nefarious come find me like I don't mean nefarious not like I"
"3802820","3803720"," don't like this guy."
"3804380","3808220"," There's people I don't like people I like people I tacitly get along with."
"3808760","3812280"," But if you don't like if you see anything sketchy ever, let me know. "
"3813180","3813800"," Let me know."
"3813980","3815320"," I'm not down with that shit at all ever."
"3815820","3816160"," Ever. "
"3817040","3817940"," Then that stuff."
"3824420","3825000"," Right on man."
"3825920","3827040"," Okay, so else we got here. "
"3828280","3829300"," Let me take a look at the."
"3831140","3832040"," So, we key is here."
"3832160","3832720"," Good morning, we key. "
"3832800","3833080"," How are you?"
"3833220","3833460"," Will M."
"3833620","3834200"," Good morning, my brother."
"3834360","3834740"," How are you?"
"3838910","3839490"," Cowboy up."
"3839630","3839890"," Good morning. "
"3840150","3840530"," Matthew Phillip."
"3840810","3841030"," Good morning."
"3841250","3841410"," Andre. "
"3841570","3841950"," Good morning."
"3842150","3842510"," How are you?"
"3843090","3843810"," Robert Ortiz."
"3844370","3844390"," Nick. "
"3844510","3845050"," Good morning."
"3845270","3845430"," Fernando."
"3845770","3846570"," All the regulars are here. "
"3846770","3847490"," Our ask good morning."
"3848290","3848610"," Starlight."
"3855100","3856820"," Yeah, you know, Mickey's making a fair point. "
"3857080","3860940"," It's weird that the market that is all based on sentiment they were panicking over literally no bad"
"3860940","3861160"," news."
"3861560","3863440"," I don't think it's a I agree with Winky to a point."
"3864020","3866300"," I understand where winky's coming from 100%. "
"3866300","3868740"," I think it's that daily trigger coming down overhead."
"3869920","3876580"," That close that we had on on the 28th from my own personal opinion from a whole second here."
"3879040","3880840"," My own from my own personal opinion. "
"3881540","3885760"," The way that the market is structured the way that hedging is structured in our market."
"3886580","3889100"," The bank if I don't know if you know this, but."
"3889600","3894400"," If you're a bank right now, you've had a kick ass year going for nine months. "
"3896120","3898240"," The market has been kick ass for you."
"3899760","3904880"," Banks want nothing less or more than for this market trade sideways enough."
"3906260","3909940"," Or sideways and down to right where we are right now in this market. "
"3910020","3911940"," The banks don't want to see us at 5000."
"3913340","3914720"," You don't want to see us at 5000."
"3915080","3916980"," The banks want to see us. "
"3917100","3918480"," Slow into the right now."
"3919060","3921960"," I think that's even the Larry Williams kind of a thing too, right?"
"3922800","3925100"," It's more like it's not so much like panic."
"3925380","3930320"," It's more like I think winky's trying to try to make that distinction here is that it's not quite"
"3930320","3930880"," bearish. "
"3930880","3933280"," It's not even bearish to trade to 3300."
"3933300","3937900"," It's more banks are out there trying to stabilize the market."
"3938480","3942900"," Believe it or not, banks don't want to see the market crash to like 1000 every two years. "
"3943640","3946500"," They want to trade sideways and up or sideways and down."
"3947100","3952940"," And only have volatility events every so often so they can get dirty prices, right?"
"3953140","3957860"," They can own it lower than you do and they can run the market back up slow and stay to"
"3957860","3958120"," the right."
"3958120","3964420"," I think I think I think winky's on the same page as I am. "
"3970710","3974450"," Matthew Phillips is saying seems really manipulated like doers are just trying to burning both"
"3974450","3974970"," calls and puts."
"3975230","3978970"," I think right now in the market there's two things going on or a bunch of stuff going on."
"3979050","3981730"," I think you've got good hedging in the market cheap hedging in the market. "
"3982050","3990190"," I think that people put past the power of retail sometimes if you've got you figure right now in"
"3990190","3997290"," this market, the only retail left are smart retail that haven't gotten completely fucking run over"
"3997290","3998050"," and torched."
"3998270","3999070"," I saw a comment."
"3999150","4001490"," I'm not going to name who this person is because they have a high follow-up. "
"4001910","4009770"," Yesterday on Fintuit I got on briefly and I saw a comment from somebody that said these bulls are"
"4009770","4014990"," going to get destroyed if we go to 3300 and I said to myself that's not true."
"4014990","4022830"," I said the only people left truly in this market that are long or bulls are probably some at this"
"4022830","4024530"," point some season traders."
"4025530","4030650"," At this point in this market where we are after the past two or three years figure after COVID"
"4030650","4035810"," crash and the run ups and the silent bear market that we had in 2021. "
"4035810","4041950"," I would suspect that market participants that I don't know if you've been here maybe three years or"
"4041950","4042210"," so."
"4042650","4045310"," You probably had three, four years, five years maybe."
"4045650","4051930"," I think at this point you've earned a stripe or two for saying I could probably make it through"
"4051930","4052810"," 3300. "
"4053610","4059470"," And I think that that implies that where we are right now that retail is probably pretty well "
"4059470","4059750","-heads."
"4061250","4066410"," Usually in markets you see banks be the size that comes in later in a bull market not early."
"4066590","4067530"," Usually it's hedge funds. "
"4068410","4078190"," Janae Marcus very famously suggested this book I hadn't read it and I read it and I'm like oh I'm"
"4078190","4078870"," like I get it."
"4079030","4079630"," I get it now."
"4080870","4083190"," And so you see hedge funds coming to the market early. "
"4083710","4085830"," They want to buy it and they want to sell it and they want to buy it."
"4088670","4091170"," So you've got that kind of an influence to the market right now."
"4091390","4096270"," So the other thing too right now is you've got sell side hedge funds right you have not Mark O "
"4096270","4100670","'Miro told us a week or two ago he said we're on sell side right now. "
"4101430","4102250"," He's a professional."
"4103430","4105649"," He's giving you an honest take."
"4105850","4107090"," He's like look we bought the bottom. "
"4107750","4114590"," You know we bought October we bought December and now we're selling February here right."
"4115029","4118069"," And so you get the heads up on that that they're on the sell side."
"4119149","4126210"," And then you've got some other problems you've got the wrong people out there bringing attention to"
"4126210","4127330"," the zero date market. "
"4127330","4134210"," You've got bank presidents mark you got Marco and you've got all you know you got Jamie Diamond"
"4134210","4136790"," saying we can crash this mark with zero dates."
"4136870","4137810"," That's bullshit."
"4138290","4140910"," They were using zero dates and early 2022. "
"4141910","4145370"," But you've got to focus on it microscope you've got people saying out there."
"4146410","4151010"," The death of the market is going to be zero dates and I'm like you're probably out there trading"
"4151010","4151609"," them right now."
"4152370","4154109"," You're probably out there saying you're not. "
"4154109","4155609"," If you're not there's a bunch of people."
"4156010","4160850"," So now you've got all these people that shouldn't be trading date zero dates in trading zero dates."
"4161410","4162750"," So the zero day market is sloppy. "
"4163290","4165430"," You're watching futures traders."
"4166390","4172590"," You're watching dealers and you're watching professional hedge funds that are not trading zero"
"4172590","4172830"," dates."
"4173029","4177090"," They're they're actually doing very well right now in the futures market. "
"4177350","4181210"," I was talking to a buddy yesterday and I was like I was like man I was like I could"
"4181210","4183170"," be making so much money right now in the futures market."
"4183170","4185130"," Because it's very clean right now."
"4185569","4189229"," Whereas the zero day market is dog shit futures market is beautiful right now. "
"4190029","4193550"," And then he said to me why well why aren't you trading it then I said well."
"4194270","4197730"," I was like I know one thing for sure that you can get run over here."
"4198250","4202890"," I was like I'm going to I'm going to gander that in October and December. "
"4203750","4204590"," In February."
"4205630","4209550"," A lot of retail futures traders got blown the fuck out."
"4210490","4215750"," Because that we went up right we squeezed higher major squeezes higher and it's not like you're"
"4215750","4221850"," going to be walking around carrying two three four five hundred thousand dollars in margin upside"
"4221850","4223330"," down for the next three months. "
"4224050","4227290"," It's going to be painful painful to carry that."
"4228410","4232210"," So I don't want to get run over in futures right now like I've like so yesterday."
"4232970","4234450"," It was a prime example. "
"4234450","4236990"," Now we didn't squeeze to four or five yesterday."
"4237790","4240050"," But I was like hey you know these last four."
"4240850","4242410"," These last four end of months. "
"4243190","4243870"," We have squeezed."
"4244630","4249510"," And if I was in futures short yesterday when that happened yesterday I'd be hurting."
"4249970","4250470"," I'd be in some. "
"4250930","4253850"," I would be I would be fucked up."
"4255010","4256170"," I'm not going to lie."
"4257770","4261570"," So it didn't happen but if we have a what last four think end of months. "
"4261570","4263590"," It's happened 50% of the time."
"4263950","4265190"," That's a real problem."
"4265510","4270970"," That's a real dangerous and risky trade for a for a retail futures trader. "
"4271290","4272030"," I'll be honest with you."
"4272030","4276630"," They might say that it's not and that they're all pros they're all entering and exiting properly."
"4277450","4278590"," But I'll be honest with you. "
"4278970","4280150"," If you're a futures trader."
"4280950","4285470"," If you were short yesterday you might have made money but I'll tell you what man it was dangerous."
"4287910","4290410"," Danger danger danger danger danger danger. "
"4292230","4293770"," And I wouldn't do it."
"4293970","4295370"," Like I don't mind trading zero dates again."
"4295550","4297530"," I'll buy a fucking 10 pack another 10 pack. "
"4298050","4301170"," Another fucking 10 pack right and try to try to score."
"4301670","4305230"," If I get burned of 10% 10% then nail 300% or."
"4306250","4309750"," I can probably lose four or five of those trades then just hit one good one. "
"4310730","4311210"," Right."
"4311430","4315010"," But if I'm in few trading futures right now the next couple days like yesterday."
"4315750","4317350"," I want nothing to fucking do with that shit. "
"4318450","4323150"," My assumption is that there's been some people that have gotten very hurt."
"4323990","4325190"," Due to that as well."
"4325490","4325550"," So. "
"4329010","4331690"," And that's directed towards Matt Phillips."
"4332230","4334410"," So I think there's all there's some of that going on right now bro."
"4341470","4343190"," Yeah, I used to be a futures trader. "
"4343450","4344190"," I still have futures account."
"4344510","4346050"," I just right now I wouldn't trade him personally."
"4347010","4348310"," Right now where we are. "
"4349250","4351530"," You can go back and go back to February and November."
"4352930","4355770"," Go back to February and November and a month."
"4356190","4356970"," The first of the month. "
"4357170","4358770"," This last one last November last February."
"4359510","4361110"," Go back and look and see what happened."
"4363550","4364490"," Tell me what happened. "
"4364670","4368270"," Those those the first the month of I believe was December 1st and I believe was."
"4370250","4372470"," March 1st or no February 1st."
"4372570","4376250"," I believe in November 30th or something like that. "
"4376570","4377150"," What happened."
"4378430","4379130"," Because I know what happened."
"4379570","4382430"," We squeezed like three or four percent in like 45 minutes. "
"4383650","4385630"," There was there was no stops left behind."
"4386910","4389050"," And I know people got torched in that trade."
"4389250","4390550"," I know for a fact that they did. "
"4391650","4393490"," Couldn't even get out of the trade if you wanted to."
"4399700","4401040"," Yeah, they've been very clean though."
"4401120","4401260"," I agree. "
"4401440","4402180"," Jill, the towels same."
"4402780","4403760"," The technicals are very clean."
"4404380","4405900"," I've noticed that Jill the past few days. "
"4406720","4410840"," I've been awake every night and I'm like, man, my futures have been fucking trade beautiful."
"4411500","4414400"," Like gorgeous, gorgeous levels on futures."
"4415500","4416520"," Absolutely stunning. "
"4417760","4421200"," Zirini markets been dog shit and futures have been fucking gorgeous."
"4422020","4423260"," Like absolutely beautiful."
"4424000","4425600"," Great trading environment right now. "
"4425840","4427480"," I'm just scared to death again run over."
"4428340","4431140"," That's my only little take that I have on that in cash market."
"4431280","4431760"," Not in futures. "
"4431980","4433500"," I'm more concerned in cash market."
"4434640","4435420"," Right now."
"4436080","4436780"," Like trade trade. "
"4451200","4452820"," Yeah, I mean, what's we got to say right now."
"4456320","4460500"," Mr. Talking about you saying if you live through this, you're going to be a much better shape to"
"4460500","4462060"," trade the market after normalizes."
"4462460","4463240"," If it ever does. "
"4463540","4463880"," Very true."
"4464260","4465020"," You guys are going to bet."
"4465260","4468700"," If you're a new trader, if you've been trading only for like five years, three years. "
"4469460","4471920"," I mean, I'm not counting the fucking COVID years."
"4472660","4473420"," What is this?"
"4473780","4474180"," 2023."
"4474860","4477920"," If you were trading the actual crash. "
"4477920","4479640"," Or let's say 2019."
"4481080","4481900"," Until now."
"4482800","4483240"," Congrats. "
"4483420","4484160"," And you've made it this far."
"4484300","4484600"," Congratulations."
"4486680","4488460"," Wait until you see the next bull run. "
"4488660","4490500"," It's going to blow your face off because you're going to."
"4491600","4492920"," It's going to be funny because."
"4493920","4496060"," When all these bulls rush into the market. "
"4497620","4500680"," Especially if you're a bull, you're going to be like fuck all these motherfucker."
"4500780","4501580"," I shouldn't be swearing that."
"4502060","4504000"," I shouldn't say that. "
"4504340","4505180"," But you're going to be like."
"4506000","4508040"," Who the fuck are these people?"
"4509620","4511480"," Who's a great class for that?"
"4512320","4517560"," Is any of the trainers that you meet from the 2000 crash or the 2007 eight crash."
"4518380","4519360"," You talk to those guys. "
"4520960","4522520"," You talk to those guys, right?"
"4524380","4525600"," I got started."
"4526060","4526860"," Oh, seven."
"4526980","4527840"," Oh, eight right in there. "
"4528280","4529460"," Well, it wasn't in the."
"4529660","4530180"," It wasn't in the market."
"4530280","4531480"," It was with a Bitcoin and stuff. "
"4532200","4533660"," I was a burner and stuff."
"4533660","4535360"," And that's why we had to occupy Wall Street stuff."
"4535820","4541220"," But people that were trading before that like, oh, I traded through 87 or I traded through 2000 or"
"4541220","4541820"," 2000 went. "
"4542140","4544300"," Oh, I traded through 2007 2008."
"4544940","4545940"," Like you meet those guys."
"4546240","4547940"," They'll tell you that like there's a flinch. "
"4548540","4550120"," They're like always flinching."
"4550920","4554020"," The bull run that took place in 2020."
"4554820","4556880"," They were like, they're like, fuck this. "
"4559020","4560580"," Just waiting till you see."
"4561460","4564140"," Just waiting till you see this new class that comes in."
"4564840","4566740"," You're going to be like, sit down and shut up. "
"4566940","4568120"," I don't want to hear what you have to say."
"4569880","4573800"," If you traded watching futures go up and down five, six percent a night."
"4574860","4576060"," Every day during COVID. "
"4578280","4582060"," You have somebody saying I've never seen a circuit breaker."
"4582800","4585100"," When they were changing the rules on circuit breakers every day."
"4585320","4587360"," Remember, they were like, we're coming out new rules and circuit breakers. "
"4587860","4589180"," We're going to adjust them today."
"4589180","4595420"," Okay, so if you're along this market, you already know what happens here, right?"
"4595880","4596880"," What are you looking for?"
"4597360","4598320"," You should already know this."
"4599620","4602680"," You want a new high on every interaction in the one minute. "
"4603740","4604840"," You're looking for."
"4606280","4608300"," You're looking for a new high, right?"
"4608600","4609020"," Got a new high."
"4609460","4610100"," Got a new high. "
"4610560","4611420"," Got a new high."
"4612280","4612820"," Got a new high."
"4612820","4613140"," Got a new high. "
"4614140","4614840"," Came back down."
"4616140","4617160"," Did we get a new high?"
"4617900","4618380"," No."
"4620040","4620980"," No new high. "
"4621180","4621740"," What does that mean?"
"4623360","4626380"," That we come back down and check the five minute next, right?"
"4629240","4632100"," We're going to see if we'll still have time on the clock."
"4632280","4634140"," It's 11.22. They've got eight minutes."
"4637550","4638310"," Eight minutes. "
"4638650","4639730"," And where will we go from here?"
"4640030","4641270"," Do you guys know where we go from here?"
"4642510","4644270"," How did you guys let me know what you think?"
"4646860","4650700"," We'll call that PT tag at this point kind of tags close enough."
"4653570","4655630"," We're going to go back down test the five minute."
"4665120","4666940"," We're going to look for the next PT above. "
"4667180","4672940"," That's going to be 395.37. We're going to draw a box above here."
"4674940","4676400"," See that little gap up here?"
"4676580","4677400"," You guys can't see it."
"4677460","4679900"," Maybe on the screen, but you see this little gray area?"
"4680720","4682340"," There's a gap above right here. "
"4682500","4684880"," This is PT two, but I want to show you something else."
"4685920","4687460"," This is PT two above."
"4688540","4697840"," And so what bulls are looking for, or what I'd be looking for here, would be a trade right here. "
"4698580","4704580"," We'll know at 11.30. So you'll be looking for this trade here."
"4704940","4713030"," Check to take out PT two."
"4713310","4715810"," Now with that said, what's forming here?"
"4715970","4717270"," Do you guys know what's forming here?"
"4718270","4720450"," You guys, can you guys see what's forming here?"
"4721510","4723150"," And I'm going to show it to you right here. "
"4723190","4725710"," If you can't see it on your own, I'm going to show you what's forming here."
"4726930","4727350"," Okay."
"4728470","4730550"," And you've got this white line right here. "
"4730930","4732070"," See that white line forming?"
"4733930","4736150"," And you see this red forming right here."
"4736430","4740170"," So if you were like, I'm going to be a bull and try to take the next trade."
"4741530","4743370"," What do you want to see here?"
"4745330","4747390"," You don't want to see this form, do you?"
"4747910","4753150"," You want to see price consolidate above and begin to make that trade there?"
"4753330","4755770"," Because if price breaks below, what do we call this?"
"4756310","4757750"," There's a bearish crossover, right?"
"4758470","4760710"," We don't want to see that bearish crossover, do we?"
"4761850","4762250"," Right?"
"4762590","4763150"," You don't want to see that. "
"4763190","4765630"," You don't want to see this white line curling over here, do you?"
"4766930","4772710"," So if this white line starts to curl over this red line, bears are already watching this."
"4772950","4777650"," They're like captains over here drawing this move higher, and yet the white lines rolling over."
"4778750","4781130"," And I don't believe we're going there. "
"4781550","4785650"," So if you've got bears already checking this out, and you're like, we're going to throw it down in"
"4785650","4786130"," these bulls."
"4789150","4791830"," Where would be the next place to look for lower?"
"4793090","4794310"," We know where that is."
"4794390","4796670"," We know that it's probably down with this white line. "
"4796670","4797790"," You see this 39149?"
"4799390","4802770"," That is where the ES low is."
"4802910","4806190"," There's another H line down below right here."
"4807530","4810150"," There's your PT1 down below if this happens. "
"4813370","4814330"," Right over here."
"4816770","4821670"," Clean up all those pivots unknown to the market down here, okay?"
"4823850","4824790"," You see that?"
"4825050","4825850"," How it's forming right here?"
"4826620","4831690"," If you're bullish here and you don't want to see that bearish crossover, what are you looking for?"
"4831830","4838270"," You're looking for this red line to come up."
"4839050","4846430"," You're looking for this white line to come up right here, and you're looking for price to be above"
"4846430","4847010"," both. "
"4849030","4849570"," Right?"
"4850090","4850630"," Consolidate."
"4850790","4851690"," Don't take the trade."
"4852370","4852970"," Get above. "
"4853730","4856790"," And that's where you take trade long or I would take trade long, not you."
"4857130","4858170"," Not financial advice."
"4859390","4861090"," Do you see how that's forming right there?"
"4865910","4867610"," Now, what do we do here?"
"4867790","4872650"," We white and watch to see where the white and red line go. "
"4873170","4873470"," Make sense?"
"4875110","4876330"," And this will show you the way."
"4879470","4880750"," I'll delete this for you here."
"4882390","4885010"," I'll do the next path over here so you can see it. "
"4887790","4888550"," Right here."
"4890750","4891910"," That one right there."
"4896150","4898710"," Matter of fact, we won't even draw these in. "
"4898830","4900650"," We'll see how this interacts with itself."
"4902730","4903810"," So you can see both."
"4906870","4908650"," Now, don't trade this. "
"4909050","4918810"," I want you to just, my suggestion to you is, to watch how this plays out and think to yourself,"
"4919130","4921990"," where is the best place that could have made entry in either direction?"
"4923490","4926410"," Draw this on your own chart at home in your own office."
"4927950","4929750"," Draw something like this out."
"4930370","4939250"," And then I want you to pretend, just say, where would have the best entry have been on a bullish"
"4939250","4940270"," or bearish trade here?"
"4940270","4944750"," Where would I have entered and what I've gotten fucked up in this trade?"
"4946690","4948290"," And where would I have put my stops?"
"4949710","4951310"," Where would I have made entry best?"
"4952210","4955130"," Where wouldn't I have gotten stopped out on the upper downside?"
"4956170","4961010"," How many of these trades could I take until I get a winner that prints two or three hundred"
"4961010","4961290"," percent?"
"4962090","4963510"," Like, so let's say I trade this. "
"4963790","4967730"," Let's say I take this trade 10 times and I put stops."
"4968770","4972230"," And I'm like, let's say, let's say I pay 50 cents."
"4973410","4976050"," And we get out of 45 cents and I get stopped out. "
"4976130","4978830"," Damn it, I lost 10 cents or five, 10 percent, excuse me."
"4979230","4980350"," Five cents, 10 percent, right?"
"4981230","4982590"," That happens to me a second time."
"4982990","4984050"," Poof, I lose 10 percent. "
"4984890","4987290"," Third time, poof, I lose 10 percent."
"4987450","4988050"," That's 30 percent."
"4989390","4990970"," Poof, fourth time was 40 percent. "
"4992170","4994110"," I'm getting all banged up paper cuts, right?"
"4995850","5001550"," And then the fifth time I take it, and it works with those stops, right?"
"5001830","5003870"," And it goes burr, baby burr."
"5004130","5007030"," And I make 100, 200 percent in that trade."
"5008250","5013810"," What about that, that those paper cuts that I took, right?"
"5013950","5015210"," Do they matter at that point?"
"5016090","5016510"," Make sense?"
"5017430","5020590"," And then when you start to refine it, you start to say, wait a minute. "
"5020670","5021890"," I don't want to take all those paper cuts."
"5021890","5023210"," And I don't want to get stopped out."
"5023650","5027430"," What would have been the best entry on each trade?"
"5028050","5031390"," Was there, was there a time for me to be more patient?"
"5032190","5038430"," Wait for stops to be liquidation breaks on the upper downside to play out?"
"5038770","5040350"," And then I've just taken the meat of the trade. "
"5041010","5044570"," So maybe I just put my finger on the buy button and chase it on the way down or chase"
"5044570","5045230"," it on the way up."
"5046590","5047170"," Make sense?"
"5051300","5051940"," There you go."
"5052000","5052860"," There's a setup for you. "
"5052860","5054740"," All drawn out for you."
"5065090","5067810"," The H line down here is the overnight low."
"5070030","5075550"," And the PT2 here is the, uh, matter of fact, it's changed now. "
"5075710","5077670"," We've got the hourly trigger coming down."
"5077790","5079770"," It's now 39534."
"5081330","5083870"," This is the, uh, this is the hourly trigger. "
"5084050","5086590"," And this is actually the week, the monthly trigger up here."
"5086690","5087610"," So you just can't see it here."
"5088390","5091590"," You'll have that tool and you'll be able to do this at home real soon. "
"5092910","5094190"," You'll be able to see these things."
"5094470","5095790"," You can't see them here with me on livestream."
"5095890","5098250"," So I'm putting them in here for you right now. "
"5103930","5105510"," And down below, there's nothing."
"5106250","5110730"," I'm going based on pivot points, how you find your levels every day."
"5111090","5114050"," I'm looking at pivot points for natural places. "
"5114330","5114970"," There's another one here."
"5115190","5116250"," There's another H line right here."
"5116370","5117030"," There's the daily low. "
"5118530","5119370"," You can't see them here."
"5119530","5119670"," Hold on."
"5119670","5123690"," Oh, there's a pre-market low. "
"5123930","5124370"," That's right here."
"5125750","5128870"," Pre-market low right here to pay attention to 39191."
"5130490","5136170"," You've got the, uh, you've got the cash market low right here. "
"5136530","5138410"," If you're at home, you could draw all these things."
"5139670","5142290"," You know, you've got ES low right here overnight low."
"5142510","5144570"," You've got the pre-market low right here. "
"5144650","5145970"," You've got the cash market open low."
"5146950","5148510"," If you're at home, you could tag all three of these."
"5148510","5149290"," One, two, three. "
"5157470","5160490"," By the time you're done, you'll have like a thousand lines on your chart and you'll be like, these"
"5160490","5161470"," are all my pivots."
"5162110","5164210"," These are the previous pivots from yesterday."
"5167050","5168810"," You know, because we can look at those two. "
"5170750","5172710"," And that's what the big white lines are."
"5174130","5175430"," You get another one right here."
"5175550","5176130"," You see this one?"
"5176810","5178570"," This is right where we are, right?"
"5178910","5179590"," This is right where we bounce. "
"5179890","5180690"," This is the low from yesterday."
"5182610","5182950"," Right?"
"5183130","5183850"," We just tagged it."
"5183850","5184850"," See it right there?"
"5187050","5189150"," Now I'm not going to draw lines with you here. "
"5189690","5193630"," I'm not going to draw a hundred lines for you right here on a live stream."
"5194610","5195410"," But you can."
"5195970","5196730"," Some people do. "
"5197490","5200010"," I know that they're, I know people make fun of people that do it."
"5200770","5204850"," But I know there's people out there, traders out there, highly technical traders."
"5205910","5209250"," They'll mark every single, every single important line and why they matter. "
"5212070","5213250"," I know that they're there."
"5213870","5215210"," You need to do that on your own."
"5215290","5216490"," I'm not going to do that here in a live stream. "
"5240450","5242290"," So let's just think about this right now."
"5242470","5247710"," If you, if you, if you, if you're on a screener at home, on a screener at home, if you"
"5247710","5248790"," watch an options chain."
"5250290","5251770"," What's happening in the background here?"
"5251930","5253050"," Do you guys know, right?"
"5253450","5255210"," You guys should always have an options chain open. "
"5256290","5261450"," You guys should always be watching like the put and call side of what you're interested in, even if"
"5261450","5262110"," you're not buying them."
"5262710","5263790"," So that you're familiar with."
"5264090","5265910"," I mean, I'm trying to do right now if I can. "
"5266770","5269410"," I'm going to try to bring up a, or you know what I'll try to do by the end of"
"5269410","5269770"," day today?"
"5270810","5272050"," Is on thinkorswim."
"5272150","5273330"," If you have a thinkorswim account."
"5274990","5277510"," You can actually watch the value of an option. "
"5278390","5279670"," I'm going to put that on the stream."
"5279670","5280530"," You know what I'm going to try to do?"
"5281470","5283090"," I'll try to do this every day for you guys."
"5285910","5287650"," TOS, TOS option chart. "
"5289590","5290730"," Google that on your own."
"5291270","5292870"," This might be easier for some of you out there."
"5293590","5298510"," If you, if you have thinkorswim or if you don't sign up for thinkorswim, get in account with them. "
"5299150","5304130"," You can actually get a chart that shows the life of an option, the pricing of it."
"5304630","5311110"," And it's fascinating to watch because now you'll see like the life of an option and you'll see it"
"5311110","5311810"," go just like this."
"5313930","5317490"," And it gives you like a tool in your toolbox to find out when you should have bought it. "
"5317990","5318470"," Make sense?"
"5319690","5321070"," And you'll be like, oh, it's interesting."
"5321430","5322350"," They got bought right there."
"5322470","5322770"," Interesting. "
"5322970","5323770"," They got bought right there."
"5323830","5324030"," Interesting."
"5324370","5325130"," They got bought right there. "
"5325410","5328950"," So most options follow a chart graph just like this."
"5329930","5331870"," And there's like, I guess it's not like that."
"5332190","5332450"," Hold on. "
"5332710","5333730"," I'm kind of fucking that up."
"5333870","5339500"," It's more like, it's more like, it's more like this."
"5343290","5347090"," And it'll actually give you some if you can't figure it out in options chain. "
"5347090","5350490"," It's like a, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a dumb trader's way to figure"
"5350490","5351470"," out an options chain."
"5352030","5354450"," And you can kind of just see the life of the option."
"5354770","5359510"," What's worth when it's on a low on its overall trip to death. "
"5361950","5363770"," You can Google search on your own."
"5363930","5365130"," I bet you can pull on."
"5366710","5369490"," I bet you can Google search on your own. "
"5370950","5371490"," Look up."
"5371650","5372490"," What did I say to look?"
"5372550","5372930"," What did I say?"
"5373010","5373210"," Look up."
"5374270","5376170"," Look up like a thinkorswim. "
"5378470","5379110"," Option chart."
"5380090","5383170"," And I bet there's a video out there somewhere that I'll tell you how to bring it up."
"5383330","5387510"," And I'll try to start, I'll try to start showing them in, in stream to you. "
"5388150","5393430"," So that we'll do is that we'll look at like the, we'll look at like the 394 P's."
"5394810","5396490"," Or everybody's on 393 P's."
"5396490","5401410"," We'll check out 393 P's and we'll check out 393 C's. "
"5402310","5406810"," And we'll look at the pricing life of those options together."
"5407770","5408870"," I'll add that to the show."
"5409590","5409930"," I promise. "
"5412050","5419330"," Normally I just look at the options chain and I'm like, I don't know, 393 C's or they started out"
"5419330","5421830"," today at, I don't know, fucking 10 cents."
"5421830","5425090"," And now they're 50 cents and now they're 20 cents and now they're sick."
"5425270","5429270"," 80 cents and now they're 40 cents and now they're 90 cents. "
"5429610","5431110"," Now they're back down to 30 cents."
"5431410","5432730"," Now they're back down to 20 cents."
"5433130","5434490"," Now they're back down to 10 cents. "
"5434730","5435430"," Now they're at zero."
"5436250","5438490"," You can do it via a chart if you wanted."
"5439450","5440570"," It's fairly easy to do. "
"5443110","5444450"," I used to do that a lot."
"5445030","5447430"," And then I just started diving into the options chain itself."
"5447430","5454310"," But an entry-level way to do that would be to have an options chain open and a chart open"
"5454310","5455890"," of that option you're interested in. "
"5457310","5460410"," As a matter of fact, you could just be like, hey, I can see the zero dates being bought."
"5461590","5466330"," And now I can just jump on that options chart and it would probably be a pretty cool tool for"
"5466330","5466850"," you to use."
"5473150","5477630"," Career low is describing how to do it right now inside a chat for you. "
"5479410","5482030"," Thanks career low for bringing that up for people."
"5482030","5483290"," I appreciate that, bro."
"5492280","5494240"," Yeah, you guys decide on your own. "
"5494860","5498360"," You guys feel free to discuss what you think is going to happen here."
"5502490","5506450"," Feel free to discuss what you're like."
"5506710","5507230"," Think about that. "
"5507450","5509190"," Pretend you're an analyst."
"5510890","5517590"," Pretend you're an analyst and start pointing out characteristics of what's happening right now."
"5518050","5519530"," You're like, oh, yeah, you know what?"
"5519590","5522030"," I'm noticing that white line coming down over their red line. "
"5522170","5522950"," I'm seeing it."
"5523970","5524790"," I'm seeing it."
"5524870","5529210"," I'm all I'm seeing prices below currently the red line. "
"5529630","5530550"," I'm seeing it."
"5531090","5533490"," Then you're like, yeah, I'm watching the options chain right now."
"5534930","5536470"," I've been watching it since open. "
"5537630","5542610"," I've been watching them and building a position in puts and they destroyed those puts for the first"
"5542610","5543910"," two hours of the day."
"5544410","5546850"," Then you're like, oh, guess what time it is 11 30."
"5547150","5548490"," They're like, huh. "
"5549590","5552930"," They go, yeah, then I saw the bulls lost the one minute, right?"
"5553150","5554530"," They failed to get a new high."
"5555710","5559890"," Start looking at this stuff and being telling yourself, what are all what is all this telling you?"
"5563500","5566640"," Then you're starting to think to yourself, well, what do we got for targets down below?"
"5568420","5570280"," We know what the pivots are for the day."
"5570520","5573200"," We know what the the H lines are for the day. "
"5573200","5579600"," I mean, you got to put risk in this market, but you can at least start doing that stuff, right?"
"5579880","5582580"," They won't be the last thing to influence the trade here would be."
"5582820","5584040"," I'm going to take a look at the VIX."
"5584460","5585860"," I'm going to take a look at XLF. "
"5586700","5587900"," I'm going to take a look at XLK."
"5588100","5589420"," I'm going to look at Apple right now."
"5589620","5590940"," I'm going to take a look at Tesla right now. "
"5592220","5594060"," Then we're going to take a look at HYG."
"5594180","5595360"," Is it at some resistance here?"
"5595580","5596780"," Is it at some support here?"
"5598660","5600360"," You know, you start looking at all those things."
"5600580","5602760"," Then you start to put a puzzle together, right?"
"5602760","5605900"," You're only missing a few pieces, right?"
"5607730","5608830"," So write all that stuff down. "
"5609110","5609890"," Mark this video."
"5610110","5612370"," It's 11.38 in the morning."
"5613410","5615030"," Write down the piece of paper, 11.30 in the morning. "
"5615150","5616810"," Just give you all the basic tools right there."
"5617470","5618110"," That's all you need."
"5618550","5619170"," Right there. "
"5619310","5620530"," You're just checking sectors."
"5621530","5623610"," You're checking some major tickers that hold up the market."
"5624270","5625870"," You're checking out the bond market. "
"5626630","5627950"," You're checking out the options chain."
"5628390","5630710"," You're checking out the moving averages."
"5631350","5632170"," You're checking out the price. "
"5632950","5635510"," And what's the last piece of that information?"
"5635510","5638250"," You've got the news available to you, right?"
"5638850","5641870"," You've got Twitter open or you've got a news squawk going."
"5642510","5645090"," You're like, hey, is the Euro market closing?"
"5645430","5649110"," Hey, we get an oil report right now, right?"
"5650010","5654950"," Is there a hedge on the market currently due to some news about to break?"
"5656030","5656550"," Right?"
"5656790","5660810"," Is a hedge fund short right now because we've got a news event breaking."
"5660810","5663850"," They want to be protective of themselves here. "
"5664450","5668110"," Once that news breaks and they're taking the hedge off the market, so we squeeze higher."
"5669290","5671330"," I think they're putting all these tools together."
"5673670","5675470"," It's 11.39 in the morning. "
"5675970","5676310"," Write down."
"5676430","5677470"," They come back in the video tomorrow."
"5678010","5680770"," Matter of fact, how you can find this part of the video is right here. "
"5681730","5687770"," Right where price is, it's 11.40 in the morning."
"5687770","5692210"," And you can actually see it down there in the doobly good boogie thing."
"5703460","5705820"," I keep forgetting to put the news back up for you guys. "
"5706580","5707620"," The news ticker."
"5707860","5708680"," I turned it off."
"5708820","5710080"," I got to put it back on for you. "
"5711900","5714020"," We got the scrolling news ticker every day."
"5718890","5721210"," We'll make sure we show that PT1 down below."
"5721490","5722030"," Yeah, there you go. "
"5722030","5723050"," We don't want to cover that up."
"5729340","5732020"," Let me check the economic calendar for today in the second."
"5732760","5738100"," We've got Waller speaking at 4 p.m. 6 p.m. We got the Fed President, Kashkari. "
"5754420","5756340"," We've got what else do we have here?"
"5756940","5757880"," Time is right now."
"5758100","5762140"," 11.40. What else do we have coming up next?"
"5762620","5765460"," We've got 11.30. We had the 4-boat before we fill auction."
"5766320","5767360"," Yeah, we've got nothing until. "
"5767600","5771400"," We've got nothing until later this afternoon."
"5772220","5772800"," I can see."
"5775000","5776760"," Remember the PT target above?"
"5780370","5781950"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"5785920","5787500"," What is that up there, 395?"
"5798960","5801240"," Not looking so bearish now, is it?"
"5801580","5802360"," No news scheduled."
"5804480","5806840"," Now 11.41, 15 minutes."
"5812000","5813340"," Look at all this consult. "
"5813680","5814780"," Imagine getting wrecked in here."
"5815360","5817900"," Can you imagine being in here and just getting torn up?"
"5818580","5820260"," You're like, I'm on the put some on the calls."
"5820260","5821720"," I'm on the put some on the calls. "
"5821780","5823400"," Meanwhile, the dealers are in the background."
"5823740","5824600"," They're like a vacuum cleaner."
"5825260","5827440"," Just vacuum it up all that premium. "
"5829140","5829660"," Theta."
"5834660","5836940"," Meanwhile, you're getting chopped up in here."
"5843400","5845440"," You're watching the options chain. "
"5846580","5848200"," You're like, which way are we going here?"
"5850780","5854460"," Personally, I think we're going up, but don't take my word for it."
"5856040","5857120"," That's my take right here."
"5857120","5857560"," We're going up. "
"5857820","5859800"," But I do not take my word for it here."
"5859920","5860680"," I say that shit."
"5860900","5862360"," Like a hedge fund is like sell. "
"5863280","5865440"," We're watching the broadcast sell right now."
"5867800","5875100"," I'm starting to give less opinions on where the market's going because they're wrong people"
"5875100","5875780"," listening in."
"5880040","5881380"," It looks like we're going up. "
"5881580","5882820"," So I'm watching this right here."
"5882840","5883200"," I want to see."
"5888410","5890090"," Oh, here comes that bear plane. "
"5897650","5899170"," I'm flat right now if you're wondering."
"5899510","5900910"," So I'm not in any trade."
"5903310","5904250"," Don't want to see this. "
"5904470","5907350"," Do you don't want to see this white line cross over the red line?"
"5907350","5910130"," Do you start seeing price get below?"
"5910370","5912190"," Start seeing this white line cross over."
"5913290","5913810"," Right?"
"5914430","5917770"," I'm still flat right now, but I'm watching this like a hawk right now."
"5918610","5920310"," But I want to see that right there. "
"5920310","5920950"," I don't want to see price."
"5920950","5921770"," They underneath it."
"5924390","5926490"," I don't want to see that rejection right there. "
"5930640","5932340"," I'm watching calls right now."
"5932560","5934780"," 395 is now down to 45 cents."
"5935460","5936620"," And guess what?"
"5938420","5939600"," I'm going to switch over to those. "
"5939740","5941380"," Those are 86 cents right now."
"5944880","5945920"," Now I don't have to take a trade."
"5946260","5949540"," If we start selling off here, I missed the bear side of this trade. "
"5949680","5950000"," That's okay."
"5950080","5950960"," I'm watching the call side."
"5951660","5952720"," I'll take every trade. "
"5952940","5957040"," If I take the bull side of these trades and they finally work themselves out, I already have an"
"5957040","5958900"," idea of where the options chain is."
"5959500","5963680"," If you're a bear and it doesn't work out for you to jump in, you're watching the put side of"
"5963680","5964040"," these trades."
"5964380","5967760"," When they form and they start to produce, you know where to take the trade down. "
"5977190","5978810"," If you're a bear here, right?"
"5978910","5980870"," If I was bearish here, I'd have my finger on a put."
"5981570","5984890"," I'm not going to actually buy it right here, but I'm going to white and see because this is the"
"5984890","5986310"," meat of the trade down here, right?"
"5987150","5988270"," Meat of the trades here."
"5988330","5989070"," It's not in here. "
"5990050","5991290"," This is where you get cut off."
"5991450","5992270"," This is where you get trapped."
"5992450","5993830"," This is where you get squeezed out. "
"5995270","5996770"," Just watch as this develops."
"6012740","6013300"," Right on."
"6013420","6014580"," You're seeing the full picture. "
"6015080","6018560"," I'm not even a Perma Bear LOL and I'm a bull trainer, but I'm seeing the full picture."
"6020620","6023040"," Troy Karp's saying bear, old plane, baby."
"6023740","6025320"," Bear, old plane cap. "
"6025900","6026600"," I think chili peppers."
"6028300","6029600"," Bear, old plane."
"6030760","6031760"," I love you, Troy. "
"6037680","6039100"," What's going on over here?"
"6039600","6040840"," We read the chat over here."

"6054720","6054920"," squeeze."
"6055480","6057940"," I'll take a look at it right now. "
"6067730","6068610"," Tough call."
"6068930","6069630"," I agree with that."
"6070230","6071430"," It's not quite ready yet though. "
"6072110","6073370"," It's priming up though."
"6074150","6075370"," Genius is priming up."
"6075510","6076230"," It's got work to do. "
"6077590","6083750"," You need price above the one and five and then your target above is three, fourteen currently on"
"6083750","6083930"," genus."
"6084710","6086170"," Not genus, but GNS."
"6088590","6092420"," Let me have a second. "
"6092540","6093360"," I've got some work to do here."
"6098240","6100220"," I've got some work in the background I've got to do here."
"6113900","6115380"," So let's say this turns bullish. "
"6115640","6116360"," What are you waiting for?"
"6116500","6117900"," You're not jumping in now, are you?"
"6118860","6118940"," Right?"
"6119220","6120900"," You're going to wait for it to develop."
"6121280","6123120"," This is the key part of this trade here."
"6124900","6126220"," Let's say you're bullish here, right?"
"6126320","6127980"," You're still waiting for this to develop. "
"6128780","6133520"," You want to see the white line come up and price check that line."
"6134000","6135160"," Take it higher, right?"
"6135960","6138020"," So you're still flat right now."
"6138580","6140640"," If you're a bull, you should still be flat. "
"6142820","6144720"," You're still waiting for this to develop."
"6157470","6158330"," Give me a second."
"6158490","6159510"," I've got some work to do in the background. "
"6167090","6168450"," There's all those up there."
"6340750","6342250"," Starting to squeeze higher now."
"6364440","6366160"," Trading higher up to one minute currently. "
"6368020","6370320"," No news expected, no economic news."
"6380940","6384560"," If this can resolve itself to the upside, we're going to be looking for a price target higher."
"6386540","6388300"," How places are we looking for above?"
"6388540","6391720"," We've got 39490. "
"6393160","6394460"," This is right here still."
"6394940","6397700"," We already tagged it or got close to tagging it right in here."
"6398620","6399500"," Then PT2 above. "
"6400460","6403240"," See if we can check this white line and see if we stay above here."
"6409120","6410700"," This is the check of the one minute."
"6410820","6411960"," Make sure we are bullish here. "
"6415380","6417220"," One minute starting to curl above here."
"6422980","6425900"," You want to see a successful defense of the one minute."
"6426080","6430960"," If you don't see the success of the defense of the one minute, trade is still not valid. "
"6432520","6434900"," You want to see a successful defense of the five minute."
"6436500","6438240"," You don't want to see price break below."
"6438440","6440460"," If it does, see a liquidation break. "
"6441400","6442420"," Try to stop you out."
"6445440","6447220"," Still flat here looking to take a trade."
"6449820","6452120"," You can see these yellow lines right here. "
"6452240","6455580"," How you want to see the defense of the one and five minute."
"6462560","6466100"," If no defense of the one and five minute, the trade is not valid."
"6468680","6470700"," You want to see the same thing on the bear side. "
"6470700","6472520"," You can actually see the dots right here."
"6473640","6475660"," You want to see the defense be successful."
"6482540","6493360"," If price"
"6493360","6495140"," goes higher, you'll see a successful defense. "
"6495480","6499360"," If you don't see price go higher, you're looking to take the bear side of the trade."
"6517010","6518130"," Still no trade yet."
"6554770","6556390"," 1154, six minutes left. "
"6557650","6560370"," The bull is not able to put it together for the next last half an hour."
"6568440","6570520"," I've got the one minute getting bullish."
"6571060","6572200"," The five minutes getting weak. "
"6573700","6579560"," The hourly still bear, not bearish, but it's not really quite bullish at this point."
"6580960","6584700"," The daily is still kind of weak at this point."
"6585860","6587460"," Hasn't shown us anything that I can see. "
"6590600","6592220"," This is in terms of velocity."
"6607820","6609080"," Looking kind of bearish here."
"6610560","6611960"," The seller is right above here. "
"6612080","6612520"," You can see him."
"6613160","6614240"," There's a nice trade for bears."
"6614720","6615040"," See the bear?"
"6615240","6616160"," The bear comes right here. "
"6616840","6618360"," So you're right here selling it down."
"6619680","6624240"," Nice, successful defense by the bears, by sellers trying to get this thing down here."
"6625060","6626600"," I'm going to look at puts right now. "
"6629560","6632680"," Looking at those 393s, they're 77 cents."
"6654470","6655610"," We'll see if this rejects."
"6657630","6658630"," My finger on the trigger. "
"6658850","6660130"," I haven't bottomed yet, but I'm looking at them."
"6660270","6661490"," They're 393Ps."
"6663310","6664270"," I said to see, but I'm at P."
"6664730","6665970"," They're now 73 cents. "
"6680230","6700760"," I want"
"6700760","6704480"," to see that white line cross underneath that blue, that red line right there."
"6709340","6711620"," I want to see price stay below it as it crosses."
"6748080","6749100"," Still no trade. "
"6763060","6765240"," Three minutes left to the half hour."
"6766460","6767520"," Almost 12 o'clock."
"6767520","6769720"," Remember that half hours are the top of the hour. "
"6769920","6775900"," So like 10, 11, 12, one, two, three, those are the half hours."
"6777320","6780340"," And that the full hour is always in the 30 minute."
"6780540","6786460"," So nine 30 to 10 30, 10 30 to 11 30, 12 30, all the way up to 430 in"
"6786460","6786820"," the afternoon. "
"6789340","6790980"," From the half hour mark right now."
"6792340","6797500"," One minute strong right now."
"6797500","6802360"," Looks like the hourly is bottoming out down here. "
"6802900","6805200"," I should say that the hourly is kind of bullish."
"6810460","6812920"," It's on the pass end of negative velocity."
"6815680","6820100"," I'm going to switch over now and look at the 395s. "
"6824130","6828230"," I just cleared the 393Ps."
"6829050","6830770"," And now I'm looking at 395C."
"6831310","6833530"," I'm going to buy set up here to check this out. "
"6833830","6835290"," I want to see a successful."
"6835850","6839110"," I want to see a successful defense of that one minute trigger."
"6844070","6845630"," Just for the bears or the bulls. "
"6846250","6846810"," Doesn't matter."
"6850350","6852850"," There is a note to be made here."
"6852990","6855030"," The longer we spend here that it becomes bullish. "
"6855030","6857150"," Sometimes I'm looking at velocity in the background."
"6858170","6860290"," It's getting bullish on the one minute here."
"6860990","6861930"," The five minutes okay. "
"6863030","6864390"," I guess the five minutes kind of bullish."
"6864970","6867490"," We have negative velocity on the hourly."
"6868690","6870390"," Turning from negative to positive. "
"6871410","6873050"," So bulls have a little bit of favor here."
"6877370","6878790"," Consolidating sideways right now."
"6880670","6884370"," You can't see this right now but I'll show it to you. "
"6884450","6884750"," How about that?"
"6884870","6885350"," I'll show it to you."
"6887780","6889840"," Let me show it to you in the back end here."
"6890980","6892120"," So you guys can actually see it. "
"6897900","6902240"," So this is velocity for the upside okay."
"6903820","6907480"," So you're going to see how velocity is coming up on the one minute right now."
"6908220","6910040"," This is the five minute right here. "
"6910600","6913540"," It's pretty much a US 30 year big break mortgage."
"6913880","6914880"," And I want you to see this."
"6914920","6917300"," Six five percent on March the second week. "
"6917480","6918140"," This is the hourly."
"6918140","6919800"," This is 65% of prior week."
"6920020","6923080"," And they say these 15 year big break mortgage average. "
"6923080","6924700"," Five, five, eight, nine percent."
"6925340","6925820"," Goddamn it."
"6925880","6926460"," Stop talking. "
"6927380","6932880"," At least right now that we're turning up on the one, the five in the hour."
"6933160","6933240"," Okay."
"6933400","6934660"," So these three right here are kind of key. "
"6936680","6939840"," And then you've got above here some targets."
"6940160","6940560"," Okay."
"6940820","6941940"," You got this little thing right here. "
"6941960","6942880"," You got these three places."
"6943220","6945860"," One, two, and three."
"6947780","6949700"," And so that's what I'm watching right now. "
"6949820","6953480"," Actually you can just see the turn up on the one minute just at this moment."
"6953480","6957560"," And these three targets would be 39489."
"6960600","6962440"," 39527 and 39560. "
"6964620","6967100"," You can see right here this one minute chart."
"6967240","6968580"," We're starting to win the one minute here."
"6969460","6970780"," And you see the targets above. "
"6972920","6977220"," This isn't really a target, but you know, you saw the rejection above here."
"6978180","6979720"," So you're going to keep your eyes on that."
"6983900","6987320"," Starting to trade above right now starting to see the one minute trade higher. "
"6993580","6996520"," So you're looking at two different things, right?"
"6996720","6997360"," You're looking at."
"6998860","7000560"," You're looking at momentum."
"7000860","7002000"," Is it negative?"
"7003280","7007920"," Is the negative momentum in the market slowing and becoming positive?"
"7009360","7013440"," You're looking at support levels and resistance levels on triggers. "
"7024940","7025420"," Right?"
"7025600","7028360"," So you've got two pieces of information that you're looking at right there."
"7031760","7036660"," Trying to give you hints as to the direction where a bias is doesn't mean we're going there, but"
"7036660","7041140"," it's a bias like just one more tool in the bag saying which way are we going?"
"7042300","7047880"," If we had had velocity on a top on the one minute, it'd be quite bearish."
"7048280","7051840"," If we had velocity on a top on the five minute, it'd be quite bearish. "
"7051840","7056040"," If we had velocity on the top on an hourly, that'd be quite bearish, right?"
"7056260","7060660"," On a clock that we're looking at from like nine thirty to ten thirty."
"7061220","7066520"," We could say are we in starting negative velocity or we're starting positive velocity."
"7067480","7068820"," That is the question, right?"
"7071180","7073140"," And we're sitting on a supporter of resistance. "
"7073360","7074260"," We don't know where it is."
"7074540","7076580"," And so you're trying to put those pieces of the puzzle together."
"7086510","7096050"," US 30-year fixed rate mortgages, 6.65%. March 2nd week versus 6.5% prior week, Freddie Mac. "
"7110690","7112370"," One minute it's starting to turn up here."
"7112450","7115130"," We'll look for a check on the one minute and see if we can get a check on this."
"7117570","7119270"," Starting to get a little more bullish here. "
"7138030","7140390"," See what you guys are saying in the chat here."
"7146320","7146820"," Yeah."
"7147020","7149640"," Um, 1910-68 figure in this out. "
"7149880","7150760"," He knows what's going on."
"7151600","7152740"," He knows what's happening."
"7159120","7160120"," James Rowland. "
"7160660","7161600"," What's up, my brother?"
"7162080","7162580"," How are you?"
"7163860","7165860"," James knows what's happening right now."
"7167640","7169520"," James knows exactly what's happening."
"7170140","7172560"," We got the one, the five and the hour turning up James. "
"7174400","7177560"," We're spending a lot of time on the one in five minute triggers."
"7177560","7183460"," What does that mean James when velocity is turning to the bullish side on the one, the minute, the"
"7183460","7184540"," five minute and the hourly."
"7184820","7187220"," James, tell him in the chat what's happening. "
"7201770","7203770"," Tell him what's happening, James, in the chat."
"7204610","7205250"," Good to see you, man."
"7205450","7205750"," How you been?"
"7219600","7220020"," McQuayous. "
"7220780","7221820"," How do I pronounce that?"
"7222140","7223120"," McQuayous or McQuas?"
"7224220","7225460"," How do I pronounce that?"
"7226240","7227260"," Is it Aquas?"
"7227480","7227860"," McQuas?"
"7228400","7228520"," Maybe?"
"7229060","7229340"," Like, blue?"
"7229880","7230400"," McBlue, maybe?"
"7231500","7232100"," McBlue for now on."
"7232720","7233400"," Or not blue."
"7233680","7234980"," Um, maybe it's, is it Agua?"
"7236180","7236820"," That's a cue. "
"7244850","7245810"," That's what James is saying."
"7245970","7248330"," This is not enough velocity right now for this to be predictive."
"7250830","7254010"," Do you think that the resistance is right here, James, or no above?"
"7256290","7259150"," And do you think that if we spend more time here as a bearish bullish?"
"7266200","7267680"," Mick Aquas, got it. "
"7268940","7270320"," Or Agua, or, yes."
"7271660","7273080"," Mick Aquas, got it."
"7278940","7280180"," Mick, McQuas. "
"7281620","7283120"," Now I'm used to McQuas."
"7284420","7286160"," I like that, McQuas."
"7300520","7303800"," Uh, grip is saying that HYG has reclaimed the five minute. "
"7303940","7305520"," He's putting out there some information here."
"7305700","7307280"," HYG has reclaimed the five minute."
"7308820","7310480"," Anybody watching the VIX out there?"
"7312560","7314800"," You got people watching the HYG right now?"
"7319510","7323190"," Should I get my weights out and start getting my blood pumping here or what?"
"7325270","7326770"," Try to get my blood pumping here. "
"7326850","7327130"," Hold on."
"7335650","7336230"," Hold on."
"7336270","7337090"," What should I do today for?"
"7337550","7338750"," What should I do today?"
"7338970","7339370"," Hold on here. "
"7344260","7345600"," Yeah, I saw that chase."
"7345600","7353480"," I saw the, um, I saw that, I saw that, um, the move into utilities."
"7354620","7356780"," I saw the move into energy too. "
"7375930","7380350"," Yeah, if I don't get my blood pumping, I'll have to take those dick pills to get the blood flowing."
"7381070","7382550"," You don't really have a choice, do you?"
"7401460","7405500"," I'll tell you, like, die of a stroke one day because you're not, you're not getting your blood"
"7405500","7405880"," flowing."
"7414090","7415430"," Look at that heart racing. "
"7423420","7424080"," Rhino pills."
"7424660","7431240"," Well, that's what I was reading about them, and I guess they were used for people to, uh, they need"
"7431240","7440200"," their, like, uh, blood ways, blood passage ways to be, um, to be opened up, right?"
"7440380","7441500"," So people don't have a stroke or whatever."
"7480200","7482560"," Oh, yeah, Jarsay and DHEA gang. "
"7483260","7484640"," I, uh, that was the pill."
"7484820","7486320"," That was the stuff that I was talking about."
"7486880","7490100"," I still have a bunch of that DHEA. "
"7490280","7491080"," That shit's wild."
"7492200","7493360"," I took that stuff."
"7493920","7498060"," That shit's like taking, uh, that's like taking, uh, what do you call it?"
"7498320","7500920"," That's like taking, uh, meth or something. "
"7502280","7506760"," So like, so like it got DHEA and I'm like, okay, I'm going to take this stuff."
"7507780","7513280"," So that, so these got people on Reddit are like, take DHEA and some other thing."
"7513280","7516360"," And they're like both, like one's a precursor for testosterone. "
"7517760","7522320"," And the other ones are precursor for, um, it's like progesterone or something."
"7523000","7526420"," And so they're like, take both of these, take one of these at nighttime, take one during the day."
"7526560","7527800"," So I'm like, I'm taking them. "
"7527880","7528540"," I'm taking them."
"7529740","7531480"," And like, I'd be fine."
"7531900","7532860"," Like no problems. "
"7532860","7539740"," And then like three days later, I'd pop one of the DHEA's and it would be like a million miles"
"7539740","7540280"," an hour."
"7540280","7543760"," And I'm like, I think I'm, I think I'm taking too much right now."
"7545520","7546800"," So I've still got those. "
"7547020","7547360"," I've got those."
"7547480","7548500"," I think I'm going to draw here."
"7548640","7548800"," Hold on. "
"7548880","7549360"," Let me look and see."
"7560620","7561820"," I'll have to pull those out."
"7562000","7564280"," I'll find, I'll find them and see what happens. "
"7566200","7568220"," And I'll show you the DHEA."
"7568520","7569180"," That stuff is wild."
"7569480","7570200"," I stopped taking them. "
"7574960","7577480"," Have any of you guys out there ever taken DHEA?"
"7577840","7579540"," Well, I didn't want to take whilst thinking this."
"7579540","7585740"," I'm like, so you lose like 3% or 0.3, 0.03% of testosterone every year."
"7585860","7586500"," So I'm like, okay. "
"7587160","7591500"," I'm like, I don't want to take testosterone or tea or any of that stuff or go out."
"7591660","7593440"," Because once you start taking that shit, you're on it forever."
"7594200","7595220"," You don't really have a choice. "
"7596460","7601600"," So the people on the people, all the crazy people on Reddit are like, oh, no man."
"7601620","7605960"," You just take the precursors and it helps you to naturally not lose so much."
"7606000","7607040"," So I'm like, okay. "
"7607920","7610640"," I'm like, what I'll do is I'll order some of that stuff."
"7611040","7613680"," And I think I took it for like one or three months."
"7615220","7621360"," If you take too much of that stuff, it's like taking like caffeine pills or something. "
"7629400","7631580"," Yeah, I haven't taken any in a while."
"7632680","7639780"," But then I just started working out more and that's been taken by vitamins and then fish pills and"
"7639780","7640320"," all that kind of stuff."
"7647220","7649100"," Any more than 15 milligrams of high dose. "
"7651240","7654680"," Yeah, I don't think I don't think I'm anti TRT at all."
"7654820","7657060"," I'm not anti and I just know that once you're on it, you're taking it."
"7658660","7660000"," That was my only concern with it. "
"7660360","7663720"," I'm not anti at all taking TRT or H or any of that stuff."
"7665540","7668000"," Especially as you get older, man, like I get it."
"7671120","7674960"," Or if you have a low T or anything like that, I understand taking it. "
"7678430","7682230"," Yeah, I think it's if you've done done with the doctors oversight."
"7684470","7687070"," I don't I don't have any issues with it."
"7688250","7693610"," I would never ever think that taking without a doctor's oversight is probably a bad idea. "
"7696500","7698880"," And then, of course, there's risks with it too, right?"
"7699100","7703960"," There's always risks with hormone or testosterone replacement therapies."
"7706240","7707880"," There's cancer risks and stuff like that."
"7715420","7716900"," It does raise your T for you. "
"7717100","7717440"," What is it called?"
"7717680","7718040"," Tonkat?"
"7725110","7728590"," Yeah, it a DHEA worked fine for me."
"7728770","7729710"," It worked good."
"7731210","7732290"," I like it. "
"7732530","7733570"," It worked good for my."
"7734390","7736810"," It made me want to or maybe like."
"7737650","7738790"," It worked good for me. "
"7739110","7743390"," My only issue that I had with it was every so often, I would take too much of it."
"7743990","7744990"," So I stopped taking it."
"7745650","7746410"," I still have it. "
"7748490","7751530"," It definitely gets you it gets you sexually aroused."
"7751530","7752330"," I'll say that."
"7753150","7757130"," So if you're not sexually aroused and you pop one of those, you're going to be. "
"7759550","7761070"," You're going to be sexually aroused."
"7761210","7761910"," I assure you that."
"7763450","7766570"," It's definitely a precursor of you want to have fun times. "
"7771840","7773060"," You did take a once."
"7777240","7778840"," Did I put a hole in the drywall?"
"7779000","7779800"," You bet your ass I did."
"7783240","7784760"," One might say it worked too well. "
"7798200","7800900"," That really well and they said it hasn't gone down at all."
"7801080","7801780"," So that might be a myth."
"7805570","7806230"," Yeah, I know. "
"7806330","7807450"," I know my T is low."
"7807830","7812230"," Well, I know my T is not low, but I always had high testosterone."
"7817320","7818780"," And it's not what it once was. "
"7819000","7819180"," So."
"7820280","7824860"," What I feel when I feel it most is my drive, not my drive, but."
"7825720","7829040"," When I was younger, I could when I was younger, I could. "
"7830260","7832240"," Go like days with no sleep."
"7832460","7834800"," Just work, work, work, work, work, work."
"7834800","7836360"," And I feel it now when I get older. "
"7838640","7842380"," Like I get when I do hard work for days, if I'm doing any kind of like work in my"
"7842380","7844020"," house from working on this stuff."
"7844760","7845520"," It's taxing."
"7845960","7846560"," I need like rest. "
"7850110","7851830"," I'm not 16 anymore, man."
"7852930","7859730"," You always want to like you want the you want the you want the stamina of a 16 year old."
"7864780","7868540"," Yellow tea kills a recovery to agree with that. "
"7872320","7874400"," Your wife is 16 years younger than you."
"7881450","7884510"," So the one minute here starting to lose some power."
"7885210","7889510"," The five that it wasn't able to push price higher hourly is still bullish. "
"7890490","7893190"," We're going through a cycle right now weakness of the market."
"7900900","7903180"," So bulls have their chance they're losing it now."
"7903280","7905900"," The bears are going to take over for the next. "
"7907540","7908880"," 15 minutes or so."
"7914900","7916200"," Yeah, you started at 35."
"7917920","7920960"," We'll see if the bears can put something together for down below. "
"7944060","7945780"," Yeah, nothing going on the market right now."
"7945780","7946960"," Something I can see."
"7951540","7953260"," Holy shit, 800 views. "
"7954220","7955080"," Very nice."
"7957820","7958420"," Yeah."
"7964750","7968150"," Are you chasing you taking testosterone right now or no?"
"7969410","7971390"," You did start taking the test off. "
"7971530","7972330"," Yeah, the gel man."
"7973750","7975330"," You feel better with the gel."
"7977090","7986940"," You probably have some about 15"
"7986940","7987960"," minutes of weakness here. "
"7989420","7991820"," Bulls couldn't put nothing together last 15 minutes."
"7993000","7995180"," You see if the bullet bears can put something together."
"7996600","7998320"," It all 15 minutes to do it. "
"8004200","8008640"," I've got a text here that said yes, but the overall market conditions are improving."
"8009400","8010320"," I agree with that too."
"8022280","8022760"," Thanks. "
"8022860","8023680"," I got something to do here."
"8051020","8052340"," I got something to do in the background."
"8052760","8053080"," Hold on here. "
"8058460","8062120"," There it's 1219 bears have 11 minutes."
"8063640","8095850"," How do"

"8103310","8104570"," Match team."
"8110770","8113610"," Team members pending requests. "
"8117110","8119150"," To team member."
"8146820","8149420"," I fucking swear to God."
"8150180","8160850"," Twitter is"
"8160850","8162750"," a dumpster fire right now. "
"8163890","8165950"," What do you guys think of Twitter right now?"
"8166150","8167170"," It is hot."
"8168150","8170330"," A hot mess right now."
"8172910","8178630"," Do any of you think that Twitter might implode in itself?"
"8180290","8183090"," What's going on?"
"8186550","8187470"," Okay, there we go. "
"8203940","8205139"," Hold on here."
"8206180","8214070"," I can't believe I'm doing this."
"8223540","8224100"," Okay. "
"8225180","8226920"," Look, I can't believe I'm doing this."
"8229120","8230040"," Hold on there."

"8287520","8425370"," All right."
"8445930","8447330"," All right, sorry about that."
"8447410","8448270"," I had some stuff had to do. "
"8450930","8455150"," I've got the developer is in here and he's like, I need this."
"8455310","8455890"," I need that."
"8456090","8456590"," I need this. "
"8456730","8457150"," I need that."
"8457330","8459810"," I'm like, can't say no to the developer."
"8460510","8462250"," I'll do whatever the developer wants. "
"8462930","8465070"," I apologize for that break that I quickly took."
"8467370","8468890"," Twitter has some issues now."
"8469110","8470430"," Yeah, I think Twitter is. "
"8473550","8474410"," Twitter is."
"8474510","8475090"," Let me take a look here."
"8475470","8475730"," Okay. "
"8475790","8479970"," So we got the bulls now taking over from the one in five minute."
"8480130","8482730"," The hourly is still improving on the bull side."
"8483150","8485830"," The daily is improving on the bull side. "
"8485830","8486770"," So we've got the hour."
"8486870","8489830"," Now, right now we get the one, the five minute on the on a bullish bias."
"8490610","8495010"," We've got the hourly though coming into the bull's defense right here. "
"8495030","8497050"," So some still bullish in my."
"8497710","8501850"," Still bullish in my projections here, although I'm not long."
"8502530","8505670"," Anything, but I am keep my eyes on 395 C's. "
"8508490","8508970"," Yeah."

"8523350","8524310"," Got a nice little wedge here."
"8524530","8526510"," If you were like a, I'm sure that if you guys are. "
"8527170","8531490"," A trader, like a, like a traditional trader, you're probably watching something like that."
"8532250","8534730"," You're like, Oh, we're getting that bullish wedge forming."
"8538030","8541170"," Got that got that bull flag forming out there. "

"8597690","8598970"," When your shit fails."
"8600130","8601630"," It's one of my favorite things. "
"8604070","8608110"," When your classic setups fail, but I've never seen it anywhere."
"8609230","8610010"," It's hilarious."

"8658460","8659240"," They are questioning."
"8662020","8666860"," They're questioning if Twitter's in, you know, breakdown mode."
"8667680","8670180"," Or if it's going to, you know, implode, not implode, but. "
"8671820","8674200"," It has serious issues with."
"8675360","8678760"," Well, you guys all know, right?"
"8678980","8687000"," Like if there's like a browser change or any kind of interaction change on the internet."
"8688400","8692780"," You have to continually work on websites and maintain them. "
"8692780","8695040"," And if you're not doing that, it starts to peek through, right?"
"8695180","8695720"," Where you have critical."

"8853160","8854180"," Yeah, I think so."
"8854260","8858200"," I think like when we're told what's going on and then you actually speak to somebody that does this"
"8858200","8858500"," stuff."
"8858520","8859900"," They're like, Oh, no, man, shit. "
"8859980","8860520"," It's really bad."
"8861780","8865000"," So like, you know, like when you don't know what's going on in the background."
"8872590","8879390"," Like the extent of what I know, like I have a, I have a, now a rudimentary idea of a"
"8879390","8880030"," word press. "
"8880610","8883170"," I used to be good at word press like a decade ago."
"8883870","8889710"," So, you know, I could, I could, I could barely find my way around and have to watch YouTube videos,"

"8941170","8942650"," I could have been rolled out so much better."
"8943430","8946910"," What do you guys think about Twitter blues?"
"8947190","8947990"," I don't know. "
"8948650","8951730"," I wonder who's in the rooms discussing this stuff."
"8953010","8954670"," I think I've been rolled out a lot better."
"8956890","8958850"," Like you just do something different. "
"8958850","8961870"," You just use Twitter blue to identify who people are."
"8961950","8962970"," Everybody gets Twitter blue."
"8963490","8967530"," If you're like, feel like I'm going to, I'm going to, um, I want to be, uh, verified. "
"8975600","8979840"," You want to wave?"

"9049050","9054630"," We've got 12345 and that date with destiny above."
"9056050","9057090"," That's 40141."
"9057450","9059210"," This is the key one right here, right?"
"9059810","9062510"," This is the one we're talking about on that captain's alpha was. "
"9063050","9065630"," Uh, we do not want to trade under this."
"9066550","9067070"," Right?"
"9067290","9069210"," We are, we don't want to reject off of this."
"9069790","9072470"," We're trying to build momentum to get above that daily. "
"9072930","9080390"," And if we reject that daily, they're going to try to smash us through monthly and weekly support in"
"9080390","9080890"," this market."
"9081070","9081410"," We don't."
"9081550","9083210"," This is the bear trade right here. "
"9084050","9084310"," Right?"
"9084430","9085650"," We don't want to see this bear trade."
"9085730","9087630"," We know what happens on this bear trade."
"9088010","9096050"," They can get very, very violent, at least in this past market in 2022, 2023 get violent up in here. "
"9096390","9098490"," So we don't want to see rejection above."
"9099110","9105770"," This is the post that I had made because of the of the break below and hold below weekly."
"9106290","9108890"," So right here is your weekly and monthly velocity right here. "
"9108970","9109170"," Okay."
"9111190","9112210"," The break below."
"9112450","9113970"," This is the bad boy right here. "
"9114870","9119770"," And we know what happens if we can't get up here, if they start to try to rain down on"
"9119770","9122470"," us on the weekly, the monthly and the daily."
"9122810","9123610"," It's, it's no bueno."
"9123790","9123870"," Right?"
"9123990","9124450"," It's no good. "
"9125530","9127570"," So we're watching this as it unfolds."
"9128530","9131230"," We're going to have to deal with this in the next day or two."
"9132010","9137850"," Probably today, tomorrow, Monday, we'll see, we'll see the result of this and what it means for the"
"9137850","9138190"," market. "
"9157180","9158980"," So super bullman, what are you?"
"9159460","9161760"," So let's understand what you're asking."
"9162540","9166060"," How are we not already under that support?"
"9166600","9167740"," Bears need to keep it under."
"9168200","9169480"," So you're all right. "
"9169700","9174440"," So Superman, what you need to know here is that the draw to the yellow line, right?"
"9175140","9178400"," Let me say I'm bringing it back up for you guys on a large timeframe."
"9179280","9181820"," So Superman's asking some questions, important questions."
"9182340","9183840"," We're going to answer them for them. "
"9187770","9193710"," And so this is what I was woken up to this morning, right?"
"9194530","9195450"," Here we go."
"9197710","9199770"," I'll just take a look at the chart right here."
"9202250","9204970"," This is your daily trigger, the yellow line right here. "
"9205090","9208430"," Okay, this is what determines trend of market."
"9208430","9210190"," A trend of market."
"9210870","9214670"," When price is above this yellow line, we're bullish. "
"9215750","9219910"," So let's just have, let's just have a, like a baseline."
"9221330","9224370"," When price is above the yellow line, we're bullish."
"9224890","9224910"," Okay. "
"9226450","9228010"," See big moves in the market."
"9228990","9230310"," Directional moves, right?"
"9230530","9230990"," You see how."
"9232250","9235930"," Bullish, bullish, bullish, bullish, bullish, bullish. "
"9236230","9242210"," This is going back to January 23rd, right?"
"9242410","9244490"," All the way into February 23rd."
"9244490","9248970"," As a matter of fact, here is where I posted on that captain's off with you, right?"
"9249110","9251030"," I said, get yourself a hedge up here."
"9251710","9253730"," We started trading below the daily. "
"9254410","9260230"," So what our bear is looking for, what our bull is looking for here is a date with destiny."
"9260910","9266070"," Now us trading below the daily, the weekly and the monthly is very bearish, right?"
"9266270","9268210"," We're still under it right now, right?"
"9268950","9269890"," Still under it right now."
"9271110","9277370"," And historically, if we begin to sell this market off, what you'll see is the daily come down and"
"9277370","9281330"," be that trigger for that move lower. "
"9282490","9288950"," So you'll see price interact with this trigger and sell down."
"9289450","9294290"," And you see how like, see like bulls need to get above the weekly, the hourly, the hourly, the"
"9294290","9295650"," weekly, the monthly, all that kind of stuff."
"9295650","9301290"," And you're seeing this, this negative momentum on higher timeframes coming down on price right now. "
"9301750","9302950"," So what do bulls need?"
"9303190","9309110"," Bulls need to get up here, get above the weekly, get above the daily, get above the hourly, try to"
"9309110","9316850"," catch five triggers to try to break above the daily trigger and start trading price higher for a"
"9316850","9317970"," next leg higher in the market."
"9318150","9324250"," If they can't do that, if they can't do that, you're going to see the market start to sell off,"
"9324410","9324570"," right?"
"9325930","9328090"," Start retesting the stuff over here."
"9328610","9336110"," And historically, the past year or so year and a half outside of these two or three moves right"
"9336110","9336410"," here. "
"9337650","9338730"," One in two."
"9339690","9344570"," And where we have a velocity slowing, negative velocity slowing down, which we can look for."
"9344870","9348070"," If we break down in here, we can look for for this role here. "
"9348510","9353070"," And if we start to lose negative velocity here, we'll know we can buy this dip, take it higher."
"9353970","9357310"," But you need to be aware of this role coming into the market."
"9358930","9359890"," Do you know what I'm saying?"
"9360630","9364930"," I don't know if you have that that speaks clearly enough or not. "
"9365650","9368910"," I don't see us selling off of the hourly just yet."
"9369330","9372050"," I'm really looking for this, this yellow line right here."
"9372150","9372810"," This is a big one. "
"9372910","9376530"," This is the one that's like directional change for an entire month."
"9376530","9386010"," And you can see the same thing taking place in"
"9386010","9388090"," Tesla right now as well."
"9388990","9390850"," Same thing is going on in Tesla right now. "
"9395010","9398530"," But what you don't want to be, you know, the one thing that you don't want to be is you"
"9398530","9404810"," don't want to be the guy that comes afterwards and says, hey, I told you so right after the fact,"
"9405030","9405130"," right?"
"9405370","9408010"," Or like, I, whoo, I made all this money, I was short the market."
"9408870","9412830"," And you're like, go back and you find out that he never said anything to you about that about to"
"9412830","9413470"," happen, right?"
"9413470","9420010"," So you want to know this information before something happens so that you can do your own due"
"9420010","9425430"," diligence and make your decisions as to how you're going to invest or trade it or or hedge against"
"9425430","9426410"," it, that kind of stuff."
"9427050","9427550"," Make sense?"
"9428350","9435790"," So as a viewer or a listener to this program, you should not expect me to be the person that"
"9435790","9443430"," comes to you afterwards and says, hey, I made all this money on the market rolling over or hand"
"9443430","9450490"," made all this money on, I don't know, we squeeze 150 points in an hour and look at me, I'm"
"9450490","9450710"," rich. "
"9451510","9453470"," That's normally what you get from people."
"9454010","9459810"," So you need to be told before something is possibly happening so that you have the information, but"
"9459810","9461850"," this is called actionable information, right?"
"9462990","9464470"," Actionable due diligence."
"9465450","9470150"," So you've got me in the background watching the stuff and saying, oh, we just triggered down below"
"9470150","9470930"," the weekly in the monthly. "
"9470930","9478940"," I got to go tell everybody that it depicts the legacy verified."
"9479400","9480000"," That's the blue."
"9480080","9482540"," I thought I think that was a very faux pas. "
"9482720","9486640"," I felt like they should do the blue check marks for anyone that wanted to get verified."
"9487440","9494160"," And then they should just do something separate like Twitter VIP or, I don't know, Twitter creator"
"9494160","9495140"," or."
"9496520","9498840"," Twitter, I want a better experience. "
"9499520","9502460"," I'm a lot anti supporting Twitter at all."
"9503020","9504220"," However, they structure it."
"9504380","9505540"," There's easy ways though. "
"9506540","9510700"," Like the weird part about this is there's some, there's some parts of it that I don't like."
"9510860","9515540"," Like they intentionally, I think, are making it clunky so that you want to have Twitter blue."
"9515700","9517120"," I don't like that aspect to it. "
"9517380","9522640"," Like, hey, we're going to make this clunky so that you want to pay every month."
"9523040","9525080"," You should be able to get by without having to pay."
"9526180","9530380"," I might, in my view, like, be able to get by on Twitter with not having to pay anything. "
"9531080","9536280"," Now, if you, if you want like a better experience, that's fine."
"9536440","9540640"," I think you offer that and you just call it something like, I don't know, Twitter enhanced."
"9542120","9542240"," Right. "
"9542900","9548640"," But right now, like the association with Twitter blue is, or at least that I see is that."
"9549340","9553900"," What I've experienced is if you pay for Twitter blue, people are like, you're a sellout."
"9554360","9559660"," For paying for Twitter blue or are you paying for Twitter blue so you get more traction. "
"9560440","9562920"," So like you're, you're viewed in a very negative light."
"9563540","9565200"," And that's not good for the brand."
"9565500","9572380"," Is it like if you're like, if you're Elon, you want, you want acceptance of, of, of someone that's"
"9572380","9574220"," paying for more service or something. "
"9574700","9577440"," But there's like, there's a real clunkiness to all of this right now."
"9577440","9580860"," How it's, how it's offered to people."
"9581400","9583100"," And of course, like I don't pay for blue. "
"9583100","9583580"," And I would."
"9584440","9588920"," Matter of fact, I was having such a hard time with Twitter that I was, this is a funny story."
"9589360","9593160"," Like a week or two ago, I'm like, man, Twitter's all fucked up right now. "
"9593700","9596300"," I'm like, I'm like, I'm just pissed off at this point."
"9596420","9597440"," I'm just going to pay for blue."
"9598900","9601760"," So I go into sign up for blue and I couldn't. "
"9603640","9606340"," So Twitter was like not allowing me to sign up."
"9606480","9608960"," This is like a week ago, I think one week ago, maybe five days ago."
"9609680","9610820"," For seven days ago. "
"9610900","9612780"," And I'm like, I just like finally had it."
"9612780","9614100"," And I'm like, I'm just going to pay for blue."
"9614520","9618620"," I'm assuming at this point that this is intentionally clunky. "
"9619040","9621460"," And then I go to sign up and pay and I couldn't."
"9621860","9626760"," And I'm like, how much fucking money do they lose today and people not be able to sign up for"
"9626760","9627000"," blue?"
"9627600","9628860"," I mean, this is insane."
"9629580","9633880"," Like, this is pure insanity for a company of this size. "
"9633880","9639060"," You're talking about, you know, you're talking about one of the premier social media kingdoms out"
"9639060","9641360"," there and you couldn't sign up for blue."
"9642180","9643560"," I was like, what is this?"
"9644620","9645620"," This is insane."
"9646320","9646960"," I'd be fired. "
"9647160","9647460"," I'd be firing."
"9647680","9653200"," You if you're in my company, like a big company like that, and you couldn't buy like an F one"
"9653200","9655480"," 50 today because we just didn't have them."
"9655740","9657240"," Not not because they're shortages. "
"9657300","9659720"," We just don't have fucking we can't sell for today."
"9660300","9661960"," You'd be fucking out the front door."
"9662680","9663020"," Be gone. "
"9674420","9686310"," Yeah, I"
"9686310","9687750"," think there's the I think."
"9687950","9691270"," Well, you got to get paid when you're not going to you're not going to do this shit for free."
"9691590","9695630"," It's like Grubster just says says the man that doesn't want people to pay him on YouTube. "
"9696790","9698890"," You know, you got to pay for the service."
"9698890","9700350"," Like this shit costs money."
"9700910","9703390"," I get that, but there's better ways like. "
"9703390","9709330"," So Twitter is you know, you see like Reddit has found a way to be profitable."
"9710090","9712710"," So how can Twitter not find that way to be profitable?"
"9713230","9715450"," So that's like a suspicious thing, right?"
"9716490","9721190"," You should be able to you should be able to get a you should be able to monetize YouTube or"
"9721190","9726870"," not YouTube, but Twitter in some fashion where it's kind of seamless where you don't notice it."
"9726870","9731350"," And then you should be able to monetize fit into it. "
"9731570","9739530"," Twitter in general, where if someone wants something more, they can get it and then you want people"
"9739530","9740610"," that want verified accounts."
"9740850","9743710"," I get that, but that that should just be included something right."
"9743870","9747750"," You just I don't know they scan your ID or something and you're now verified. "
"9748710","9750670"," You know, just something simple like that."
"9751050","9752790"," They kind of fucked up that whole process."
"9754350","9754930"," You know what?"
"9754950","9758870"," The other thing too is what is red doesn't read it do like coins and shit. "
"9759930","9763590"," You used to go on like Wall Street bets and people's people are gifting each other."
"9764990","9767290"," Silver and gold and all this other nonsense."
"9769790","9770190"," Seamless. "
"9771450","9771850"," Seamless."
"9772630","9773990"," People are just I used to do it."
"9774090","9777390"," I used to I used to I used to I can't admit that I didn't do it. "
"9778050","9779470"," But I used to be on Wall Street bets."
"9779930","9780830"," I'd make a big win."
"9781710","9782790"," Huge win, right?"
"9782930","9783530"," This is true. "
"9783850","9785310"," I can't believe we used to do this."
"9785870","9786770"," So stupid."
"9787370","9791430"," But I would go into like Wall Street bets like one, two o'clock in the morning and I'd buy"
"9791430","9794090"," like $500 worth of those tokens and shit. "
"9794530","9800790"," And I'd start fucking gifting people like coins and stuff and act like I was like king of the king"
"9800790","9802370"," of the world in genius."
"9803450","9804330"," Totally ingenious."
"9806770","9807210"," Totally. "
"9807510","9811690"," If you didn't have fin to it, people would be going to like their best friends and just start"
"9811690","9813890"," gifting them, you know, coins and shit."
"9814370","9815910"," Like you can wear this for a day."
"9818390","9820130"," Can you imagine that in fin to it?"
"9820270","9824670"," Like if you made a good call and people just came to you and were like tagged you with like"
"9824670","9827590"," a $5 crown or something. "
"9828310","9830310"," And your crown got more jewels in it."
"9830310","9833950"," The more the better the trade that you made or something like that."
"9834050","9835290"," And you called it before it happened. "
"9835770","9839830"," So you had like the biggest, baddest like platinum crown on your head or something."
"9841630","9842070"," Seamless."
"9843870","9844310"," Seamless. "
"9845070","9847230"," And he would be raking in the money from that shit."
"9848290","9850590"," If you had like, I don't know."
"9851190","9854310"," And you could you could probably have emojis. "
"9854310","9860410"," Not emojis, but like some kind of some something for your profile or or your name or something."
"9861470","9867570"," For whatever interest you let's say you were like a I don't know like a fucking skier and you're in"
"9867570","9868610"," like ski to it."
"9869350","9872550"," And you end up getting like a mountain next to your name or something. "
"9872750","9874950"," You could monetize all kinds of stupid shit like that."
"9880170","9884030"," No, you don't, but Reddit does is my point."
"9884970","9888590"," So so Reddit seamlessly funds itself. "
"9889830","9898170"," While you're this is the same shit as this is like the same shit as as what is it called"
"9898170","9899110"," with video games."
"9899670","9903610"," Where you like you here's your gun, but do you want the platinum gun."
"9904470","9906970"," And people are like, don't buy the platinum gun. "
"9906990","9908570"," But other people are like, fuck you, I'm rich."
"9909010","9910110"," I'm going to buy the platinum gun."
"9910910","9915470"," So I mean, so Twitter could do that easily. "
"9917710","9923370"," And seamlessly without but like the noise with right now with Twitter is just the it's a disaster."
"9930130","9932210"," Yeah, like play to what not it's not play to win."
"9932390","9937210"," It's what that's what's that shit called when they do this in video games all the time. "
"9937450","9938690"," Like some of them are very nefarious."
"9939870","9941130"," Some of some of this shit's nefarious."
"9941730","9945090"," You'll see like the platinum gun, but it's the same. "
"9945330","9946470"," It doesn't have any nerfs to it."
"9946510","9946950"," It's the same."
"9947430","9951750"," But then other other shit they sell, you get an edge on other players. "
"9952070","9952850"," That's not cool."
"9953130","9954670"," But can you imagine being a fin to it?"
"9954670","9960530"," And you're like, you got like some big old fucking diamond across the crown over your over your"
"9960530","9960730"," name."
"9960730","9961830"," Just cock to the side. "
"9962330","9963950"," And it's good for like a week."
"9964750","9967870"," And so you're just walking around fin to it and you're like, Hey, how's it going?"
"9968090","9969410"," And you're like, get this big old crowd on."
"9974630","9976150"," That's it would be fucking hilarious. "
"9977010","9982490"," You'd weed out all the bad fucking you'd weed out all the bad alpha and fin to it like in"
"9982490","9983910"," like two months to be over."
"9986270","9992830"," You'd have like, you'd have like Jedi Marcus walking around with like a big fur coat and fucking"
"9992830","9994150"," crown cocked sideways."
"9995970","9998550"," A bunch of diamond and crusted shit up there. "
"9999290","10003850"," You'd have like a leopard on a chain or something like a diamond's crusted gold chain."
"10009030","10010030"," Wouldn't that be insane?"
"10010750","10012150"," Can you imagine that on fin to it?"
"10014090","10015270"," And it's like good for a week."
"10015570","10016690"," Your elf is good for a week. "
"10017190","10018350"," You get it for a week."
"10019470","10023870"," And then if you like, you see somebody the week later and they're like the week before they're like"
"10023870","10026290"," decked out and just drip, right?"
"10026550","10027450"," Just straight drip."
"10028130","10031990"," And then the following week, they're just kicking around with no none of that drip anymore. "
"10031990","10033810"," And they're like, fuck, I fucked up."
"10034710","10036250"," You wouldn't even have to ask them."
"10036250","10037290"," You'd be like, what happened, man?"
"10037630","10040650"," Are you okay to get banged up last week?"
"10041530","10042510"," We would be hilarious. "
"10053300","10054680"," And this is why we have inflation."
"10056620","10061380"," And meanwhile, meanwhile, you know, Elon would be just cranking money."
"10063120","10065340"," And you know, and you know what the, you know what?"
"10065340","10066480"," You could make this all fucked up. "
"10066540","10069920"," You could have like, you could have like whatever that drip is."
"10071340","10073720"," You could even attach who bought it for him."
"10075420","10081320"," So you'd see like incentivize the person with that giant fucking bottom forming under there. "
"10082120","10088720"," You'd literally, you'd incentivize the person to buy the drip and gift the drip."
"10089000","10096060"," So you'd see like Jedi Marcus with like, I don't know, like a fucking, like, I don't know, like a"
"10096060","10098600"," huge diamond on top of his head."
"10098600","10101320"," And it would say like gifted by always. "
"10101860","10104100"," And always is like, it was a good week."
"10106720","10107880"," That's my boy over there."
"10107940","10109400"," He helped me out making some money this week. "
"10112280","10115980"," Meanwhile, Elon's just raking in the cash, just raking it in."
"10118900","10121940"," Like a hundred bucks or something for like the ultimate jewel."
"10128300","10129080"," I'm serious. "
"10129540","10129860"," They do that."
"10129980","10130600"," Should I Wall Street?"
"10130740","10131160"," Well, they used to."
"10131220","10134420"," I don't know if they still do it, but they used to do it in Wall Street butts. "
"10134760","10142180"," And the neat part about Wall Street butts was they wouldn't show who gave you that shit publicly,"
"10142180","10145940"," but the person that got it."
"10145940","10151260"," It was really fascinating how it worked because the person that got it would know who gifted it to"
"10151260","10151460"," him."
"10152220","10160640"," So if you posted some Alpha and Wall Street butts, if you were like apples going from $50 to $60"
"10160640","10161380"," by Friday. "
"10162300","10166460"," And someone was in Wall Street butts and they saw that post and they took that trade."
"10167220","10173180"," They would come back into Wall Street butts and be like, they'd be like, I gotta go find a dipshit"
"10173180","10175240"," 57 Wendy's dumpster."
"10175720","10179660"," And so they'd go into Wall Street butts and be like, hey, I just want to say thank you find"
"10179660","10181140"," that person and you gift them. "
"10181540","10185780"," And you'd be like, here man, this isn't much but here's like a hundred dollar platinum or"
"10185780","10186040"," something."
"10186260","10190760"," Here's a bunch of shit while you're here in the chat room or something in that forum."
"10192280","10196620"," And so you would be like, I remember you posting that dog and I made all this money off that"
"10196620","10196860"," shit. "
"10197060","10198860"," That shit's all seamless."
"10199960","10202580"," Easy way to make money on Twitter for Elon."
"10203000","10205180"," And you got people with money to burn when they're happiest. "
"10206620","10207460"," Like happiest."
"10207820","10212900"," Like, dude, I just made a ton of money on that trade that a wifey put out or whoever, you"
"10212900","10214240"," know, you name them out there."
"10216040","10219060"," You name anybody out there on Fintuit that's shot calling. "
"10221920","10229020"," Dip buyers and top sellers that are out there just drud to say and this is this trade that trade."
"10235530","10238270"," Yeah, micro transactions, Winky, you got it, bro."
"10239890","10242070"," Loot boxes, all that stuff. "
"10242290","10244050"," That shit would just make Twitter burn money."
"10244750","10245910"," They'd burn money all day long."
"10246370","10247330"," So it's kind of bizarre. "
"10247330","10250790"," How it's set up right now or the track they're taking."
"10250950","10257130"," They could easily look at other gaming or look at social media done across the internet or figure"
"10257130","10258130"," something like that."
"10260390","10261470"," It's like a drip. "
"10261770","10262810"," You just call it drip."
"10264350","10265310"," Twitter drip."
"10267130","10268370"," We're already figuring this. "
"10268490","10272830"," We're figuring this out in a quick brainstorming session, a chat room on a Twitch video."
"10274410","10275790"," It's taking us like an hour."
"10276830","10277570"," What is this?"
"10277730","10278950"," How many people are here right now?"
"10279070","10281830"," I've probably got a thousand people or something between the two. "
"10282950","10286150"," The thousand of us sitting here right now figured out how to monetize Twitter."
"10286870","10287310"," Free."
"10292740","10297040"," Oh, yeah, dude. "
"10297340","10298900"," I forget even some tick."
"10299140","10302300"," Let's say ticks ego would explode, but the people that are given tick would love it too."
"10302300","10304600"," I'd be like, yeah, man, I followed that guy. "
"10304820","10307760"," So you'd like it would be it would be a win-win for everybody."
"10309860","10312280"," And the worst part is that who's getting the money?"
"10312580","10312740"," Elon."
"10313900","10315200"," Elon's getting all that money. "
"10315780","10316940"," Tick isn't getting it."
"10317660","10318760"," You're giving it away."
"10320440","10321320"," Feed somebody's ego. "
"10321640","10325180"," And meanwhile, fucking Elon's just pocketing cash all day long."
"10337440","10338640"," They're problem solved."
"10341040","10350810"," Yeah, I don't,"
"10350930","10352590"," um, grinding higher right now. "
"10353410","10355710"," 395 C is trading 57 cents."
"10357410","10359350"," Let's take a look around the market here."
"10359470","10361090"," I'll take a look in the background and see what's going on. "
"10361230","10362590"," Not much going on right now, right?"
"10362830","10363430"," Just grinding higher."
"10366590","10367750"," One minute's okay."
"10368970","10369490"," Not great. "
"10369910","10370690"," Five minutes, not great."
"10371250","10371750"," Hourly though."
"10374450","10377710"," The hourly is looking like we're going to squeeze at some point. "
"10378370","10378910"," We're not."
"10379090","10380130"," We're almost there."
"10380330","10381870"," So just a heads up to you. "
"10381930","10385590"," If you're out there in your shortest market, there's likely a squeeze."
"10387370","10388410"," Building in the background."
"10388930","10390170"," Just be conscious of it. "
"10390590","10392710"," We are building up for a squeeze higher."
"10392750","10394250"," We're going to get rid of this one for now."
"10395370","10401910"," There is some, there is some momentum in the background here that is building for a push higher. "
"10403370","10405370"," Get on to it and tell everybody."
"10406450","10410990"," Say, uh, Captain James says that there's momentum building for a squeeze higher here."
"10412830","10416150"," Say, I don't want to take, I'm too scared to take the risk here. "
"10416570","10418370"," Say he's not telling me to go long."
"10419250","10422230"," Nobody's telling you or he's telling me that there's momentum building in the background."
"10422490","10425910"," If you are out there and you're watching the hourly, uh, velocity. "
"10427630","10431850"," On the market, the hourly velocity is about to roll into some kind of a big move."
"10433690","10436370"," We're looking for a big move here at some point."
"10436690","10438590"," Unless some news comes in, we don't know about. "
"10442140","10443480"," We're looking for a move higher."
"10449460","10449820"," Hey, Chan."
"10450080","10450720"," How are you doing out there?"
"10450840","10451280"," How's everybody doing?"
"10451480","10453000"," Can you guys do me a solid out there?"
"10454000","10460560"," Do you guys mind, uh, liking these videos and maybe sharing these videos wherever you are in social"
"10460560","10461000"," media?"
"10462180","10464660"," Um, subscribing if you can. "
"10465020","10465900"," I'd appreciate that."
"10466500","10466960"," It's all free."
"10467800","10472340"," If you don't mind, uh, just pushing me out there and being like, Hey, here's today's live stream. "
"10472560","10476040"," If you want to follow it or something like that, I really appreciate that."
"10477500","10479020"," That helps the channel to grow."
"10490240","10492020"," Uh, we're on the spy right now. "
"10492680","10495760"," S P 500 momentum is building to the upside and the hourly."
"10496660","10498520"," Should see a squeeze here coming up."
"10498520","10499800"," To be soon. "
"10499940","10506520"," Uh, not guaranteed, of course, can't guarantee anything, but it is momentum is building in the"
"10506520","10507780"," background here for a move higher."
"10516150","10517690"," We got three targets above."
"10517950","10520810"," We've got the first two PT one here, PT two. "
"10521310","10522610"," And we've got one more."
"10522710","10523630"," We had a date with destiny."
"10523630","10526290"," Looks like possibly above at. "
"10527130","10529250"," The automatic short at 401."
"10533920","10537660"," Here and here is likely or a fair chance of it."
"10538360","10540440"," Uh, above here is the next one. "
"10540520","10542900"," This is the date with destiny that everybody's talking about."
"10543220","10547860"," We know that price needs to stay above the one minute and the five minute to get here."
"10548240","10550380"," Uh, trade is dead if we're below this. "
"10550560","10552280"," If we go below 39395."
"10564630","10565690"," Burn up, baby."
"10565850","10566390"," Make some money. "
"10571100","10572080"," Not financial advice."
"10572080","10574100"," I want you to know that there's no financial advice."
"10574200","10576340"," I've got a scrolling ticker down here that says. "
"10577060","10579980"," This broadcast is for entertainment purposes only."
"10580440","10582520"," Like playing video games, paper, trade it."
"10582680","10583720"," You trade it on paper. "
"10584600","10587360"," Trade it with fake money on a brokerage or something."
"10588560","10590720"," You can't time your trades with me, of course."
"10591340","10596680"," These are these trades that I take are, you know, they go up and down 10, 20% before you"

"10614660","10617560"," People are saying that they're really enjoying the experience on Twitch."
"10618180","10622200"," You don't have to speed up the playback on Twitch like you do on YouTube. "
"10623640","10628360"," It's actually a better user experience and there's a bunch of cool shit on Twitch as well."
"10629000","10633920"," I'm not affiliated with Twitch or any way, shape or form, but that is what viewers, long time"
"10633920","10637580"," viewers are saying they're having a lot of good experience on Twitch right now."
"10637940","10642220"," You can also pop out the Twitch video and the Twitch chat box. "
"10643160","10648940"," I think and work on other things on your on your desktop and not have to be stuck in the"
"10648940","10652000"," YouTube like we have to have everything open on YouTube."
"10652640","10657100"," I think some people are reporting they're having great experiences with the live stream over there."
"10660570","10662110"," Time to get those weights out. "
"10662610","10663290"," Hold on here."

"10697000","10706780"," Let me get the other side"
"10706780","10707040"," going."
"10714880","10716040"," Can't be one arm."

"10717720","10728880"," We got one, two, three, four, go to muscle failure, five, six, seven,"
"10729880","10734060"," eight, nine, ten."
"10734340","10735400"," Give me some failure, baby."
"10743220","10744420"," Gotta move up in weights. "
"10750220","10752480"," I gotta move up weight and add weight on there."
"10753980","10756760"," I need to get some failure faster than that."
"10797240","10818370"," I can actually"
"10818370","10819070"," feel that one. "
"10819750","10821510"," I felt that one."
"10821750","10823190"," I felt that one for sure."
"10823410","10824010"," That one felt good. "
"10825530","10831650"," I had to almost lift them like 15 or 16 times, maybe 17 times to get that feel."
"10853770","10855050"," Yeah, baby, dirty pumping."
"10857150","10858850"," Gotta stretch out that back too. "
"10875270","10879190"," Yeah, I'm watching the velocity in the background here so you can see it."
"10881550","10882270"," I'm tired."
"10888750","10889550"," I'm okay. "
"10892150","10894310"," Can I meet this here for a second?"
"10898340","10898920"," I can move this somewhere."
"10902600","10904300"," Move this down here for a second."
"10906680","10907120"," Okay. "
"10910700","10913060"," So we are trading above the one minute."
"10913260","10915400"," See the white line right there, the red line."
"10915540","10917660"," We're trading above the one minute, the five minute right now. "
"10918720","10922120"," One minute is starting to become bullish, right?"
"10922620","10923000"," Five minutes."
"10923260","10926520"," A little bit bearish right here, but you'll see the rotation in the one in five minute."
"10926540","10927340"," How quickly it happens?"
"10928100","10929760"," This is the big one right here. "
"10929900","10931600"," This is your hourly."
"10933040","10935660"," And you can see how, so I want to show you this."
"10935780","10939980"," This is where we top out on bullishness, right?"
"10940840","10943560"," If we top out on bullish, just start becoming bearish on the hourly. "
"10947140","10954880"," We level out on negativity and then we start to come back up here and become bullish on the hourly,"
"10955160","10955320"," right?"
"10956540","10962980"," And I'll show you what happens in previous instances of this."
"10964420","10967620"," And we start building bullish momentum in the background here."
"10967700","10972260"," And I want to show you what happens here. "
"10972420","10972520"," Okay."
"10972700","10973560"," Do you see this right here?"
"10974220","10976060"," I want you to follow my cursor right here."
"10976860","10980800"," And you see how you've got negative momentum. "
"10981980","10984740"," And then that negative momentum starts to bottom out, right?"
"10984740","10986320"," We start to get bullish here."
"10986480","10986940"," You see that?"
"10987500","10988820"," Follow my cursor here, okay?"
"10990080","10991920"," And you're expecting this right here."
"10991980","10992860"," Do you see that right there?"
"10994340","10997000"," You're expecting this right here to happen, right?"
"10997940","11001040"," So you're looking, so keep your eyes right there, okay?"
"11001940","11007060"," And so what you're looking for here is, see you're right in here. "
"11009360","11010740"," Right about there, okay?"
"11010860","11012460"," I want you to see what that, what happens there."
"11012540","11013760"," You see that big squeeze higher?"
"11014840","11017520"," And you can actually see it right here as well, right?"
"11018120","11024380"," Start to negative momentum, roll over, and then pause momentum for a squeeze higher."
"11024520","11025600"," So we're right here right now. "
"11026260","11029840"," So what I'm looking for into the hour, which is it's 108."
"11030980","11034040"," So what I'm looking for here is this kind of same kind of a thing, right?"
"11034180","11035360"," I'm looking for a squeeze here."
"11035500","11036000"," Does that make sense?"
"11037340","11038540"," Looking for a squeeze right here. "
"11038980","11039720"," Do we get the squeeze?"
"11039720","11045040"," We see the momentum, the negative momentum starting to turn positive on the hourly."
"11046200","11048540"," So this is what I'm looking for right here, okay?"
"11049960","11050980"," Let's see it right here."
"11053360","11054200"," Previous examples. "
"11055540","11056700"," And so what am I waiting for?"
"11056860","11062540"," I'm waiting for the hourly consolidation for the price to stay above the one minute on the spot."
"11063980","11066240"," So you guys can actually see what I'm looking for here."
"11067620","11068860"," Hold on, let me move this up. "
"11074790","11076670"," I have this right right over here."
"11085080","11087080"," Looking for all this consolidation here."
"11088020","11091080"," I'm going to be looking for a trade higher end to the hour. "
"11091360","11093180"," So right now it's 109 PM."
"11094740","11097460"," So I'm looking for the next 21 minutes for consolidation."
"11097460","11102420"," And I'm going to hope that the next hour produces that, the beginnings of that move higher. "
"11108760","11112380"," We all know that the call wall means nothing on intraday trading."
"11112720","11116560"," We all know that zero dates do does not show up on the call wall."
"11117220","11120480"," The gamma bros have no sale over intraday moves right now. "
"11121320","11123820"," We know that that's in the implied ball complex."
"11124500","11126980"," Find it out if we're buying zero dates or not."
"11126980","11128940"," We're buying puts or calls. "
"11131440","11136600"," Right now currently we've got 327,000 puts."
"11137340","11139020"," Right now there were 38 cents."
"11139800","11143660"," So you might get a small roll with those print puts begin to print a little bit. "
"11144140","11147080"," Then we're going to be looking for a squeeze higher at some point."
"11150080","11151940"," I'm going to sit right here and watch this."
"11155800","11157600"," And I'm waiting for the hour. "
"11157960","11158880"," So I'm flat right now."
"11159320","11162740"," And I'm just looking for the hour to hit with for us to hit 130 ish."
"11163300","11165560"," And I'm going to see if we can get this squeeze higher going. "
"11194940","11196420"," Just have some patience."
"11200060","11200700"," I'll be honest."
"11200960","11201880"," I'll be honest with you though. "
"11202440","11206580"," If we could get a roll like this, if we could get something like this, like a quick rip down."
"11207940","11209720"," And then we get that slingshot higher."
"11209720","11210580"," That would be awesome. "
"11210880","11213580"," Like I would totally buy that cheap ass calls down here."
"11213780","11214500"," I buy that."
"11214680","11215640"," I buy the F out of that. "
"11222950","11224890"," I'm going to fire up the Nvidia chart."
"11225130","11225430"," Hell yeah."
"11225630","11226970"," We can fire up the Nvidia chart. "
"11227110","11228390"," You guys want to see the Nvidia chart?"
"11228830","11229290"," I got you."
"11231110","11235410"," While we're waiting on the rest of the market, we'll try to look up some dude Nvidia."
"11236050","11236470"," Nvidia. "
"11240350","11242990"," Dude Nvidia pumping right now."
"11244250","11246430"," Nvidia is looking impulsive, isn't it?"
"11247390","11249250"," Nvidia is all hot and sweaty here."
"11249830","11250230"," Look at Nvidia. "
"11252050","11253110"," Okay, let's take a look at Nvidia."
"11257020","11258040"," Okay, so Nvidia."
"11259160","11260340"," Let's move this down man. "
"11260540","11263740"," I got to find a way to move this thing around here."
"11265220","11266380"," You got to hold on a second here."
"11269330","11270170"," Maybe right there. "
"11270310","11271010"," You guys can't see that."
"11271110","11271630"," Okay, that's better."
"11272410","11274470"," So Nvidia man, just banging. "
"11274470","11277330"," So here's a keen part for you for Nvidia."
"11278430","11280050"," This is what bulls are looking."
"11280390","11282030"," So see the Nvidia chart?"
"11282670","11285350"," This is what bulls are looking for for the stock market right here. "
"11285650","11287390"," Trade below the daily."
"11287970","11288930"," Get above the daily."
"11289170","11289910"," It becomes bullish. "
"11291030","11292590"," This is January 23rd."
"11293010","11293870"," What did Nvidia do?"
"11294810","11295590"," Like a beast mode."
"11296070","11296130"," Boom. "
"11297290","11297370"," Right."
"11297750","11297810"," Boom."
"11300230","11300290"," Right. "
"11300910","11302270"," All off its hourly."
"11302770","11304290"," Took off on the daily."
"11304650","11305990"," It was like a rocket ship, right?"
"11306450","11310390"," And then just started, just started slamming off its, off its hourly trigger. "
"11310930","11311330"," Look at this."
"11311510","11312070"," One up, right?"
"11312310","11313130"," Hits the hourly boom."
"11313770","11314470"," Hourly boom. "
"11314810","11315250"," Hourly boom."
"11315510","11316010"," Hourly boom."
"11316230","11316770"," Hourly boom. "
"11317130","11317510"," Hourly boom."
"11317710","11318410"," Well, drop through."
"11319050","11319770"," Not good, right?"
"11320950","11321890"," Failed to make a new high. "
"11322690","11324450"," Came right back down and tested it's out."
"11324670","11325910"," It's, it's daily, right?"
"11326670","11327130"," What did it do?"
"11327910","11327950"," Boom."
"11328170","11328610"," Explode. "
"11328610","11336950"," So we're starting to see a little bit of, little bit of weakness here on Nvidia, right?"
"11337230","11341090"," Not really the prime setup for Nvidia at this point."
"11341750","11343430"," What does a bull want to see in Nvidia?"
"11345230","11348310"," Well, you see this right now, price is below the hourly."
"11348570","11349850"," We don't like seeing that, right?"
"11350910","11353870"," You want price above the hourly and the one in five minutes. "
"11354410","11357390"," So the hourly right now on Nvidia is 228, 72."
"11357950","11361410"," You want to see price get above the hourly, okay?"
"11361690","11363550"," 228, 66."
"11364530","11368350"," You want to get above that number or I would want to get above that number and I'd want to"
"11368350","11369510"," put a stop right below it. "
"11371230","11375430"," Otherwise, if I wasn't long in video right now, what am I looking for?"
"11376390","11378170"," I want to, I want to check down here."
"11378750","11381630"," And that currently sits at 213, 21."
"11382330","11383770"," 213, 21. "
"11384790","11387890"," If it gets a rejection off the hourly and comes back down."
"11388370","11393330"," I then want the one in five minutes on your charts at home to get underneath."
"11394730","11397390"," And start and price to start to head higher again. "
"11397410","11398030"," Does that make sense?"
"11399090","11402290"," So if you're at home, you're going to read a box right now at 213, 21."
"11402930","11404770"," You already have your white and red lines."
"11404910","11406530"," You already know where to look for it. "
"11406970","11409890"," And you can do another box above here at 228, 85."
"11410290","11410810"," Don't trade it."
"11410810","11413970"," You should expect the results from any federal reverse repoporation. "
"11414110","11414490"," Make sense?"
"11416410","11416730"," NVIDIA."
"11421420","11422560"," Good call out, by the way."
"11423860","11424740"," I like it. "
"11430320","11431140"," Done, Devin."
"11432480","11433420"," Like the videos, Devin."
"11434440","11437780"," Share these videos for bringing up the chart for you. "
"11456680","11457940"," Done, fired up NVIDIA."
"11458540","11460220"," Any other check or call outs out there?"
"11468040","11470760"," And 99 cast parties take two spot, 192."
"11471800","11473900"," Trillion dollars at the federal reverse repoporation. "
"11475060","11477920"," You see if we got anything that I can see here for you."
"11478600","11481600"," I'm going to look for, I might enter this long call here."
"11481840","11483840"," So I'm going to look for a dip buy down here. "
"11485100","11487340"," I'm going to look to buy this if I can."
"11487340","11489640"," Any kind of like a rainbow."
"11490140","11491180"," Get free daily points. "
"11492180","11495260"," I'm looking for the spot down here."
"11498950","11502350"," Let me take a quick look at a traditional chart here and see if."
"11505990","11508430"," I mean, they're going to say that this is a bear flag, but. "
"11511380","11513260"," Is there something like that forming up?"
"11522610","11525430"," I'm going to keep my eye right here and see if there's a way to."
"11526050","11528250"," I'm interested to buy a dip down here."
"11541100","11543340"," I'm interested in something that's right now. "
"11543340","11544900"," It's 117 so."
"11547380","11548920"," Like next 13 minutes."
"11548920","11553500"," If there's something down here, I can grab some kind of weakness that happens for a few minutes. "
"11553960","11557100"," I'm interested in it."
"11560230","11560870"," Hold on."
"11561030","11562730"," I'm seeing what you guys are saying out there. "
"11562870","11563090"," Hold on."
"11563170","11564610"," I'm trying to get some charts up for you guys."
"11565010","11567430"," If I do your chart, do me a solid and get on. "
"11567950","11571070"," Get on social media and be like, here's a link to the broadcast."
"11573250","11574490"," Uh, doom."
"11577050","11577450"," NYCB. "
"11578390","11579410"," Okay, hold on here."
"11581050","11581450"," NYCB."
"11588470","11589890"," Oh man, NYCB. "
"11592570","11594030"," It's got some more down."
"11594330","11596110"," It looks like it's got some more down ahead of it."
"11596270","11597050"," Here, I'll start doing it. "
"11597130","11599270"," I'm going to do it like a ticker storm for you guys."
"11599490","11599630"," Okay."
"11600750","11602690"," We'll do a quick ticker storm here. "
"11605970","11607530"," We'll run through them really fast."
"11609370","11611950"," Okay, uh, NYCB."
"11612570","11614290"," You guys see GS get whacked. "
"11616010","11617230"," Uh, so down here."
"11617330","11618250"," This is the daily, right?"
"11618530","11620230"," It's not quite done going down."
"11620430","11621310"," That's what I'm going to tell you. "
"11621610","11622630"," The hourly is improving."
"11623670","11627770"," Your five minute is, uh, kind of improving your one minute."
"11627770","11629270"," It's not really doing anything at this moment. "
"11630530","11632070"," I would be looking though."
"11635650","11640470"," I'd probably check back on this low down here on this eight dollars and eight cents."
"11641870","11642910"," Is where I'd be looking. "
"11643570","11645790"," Let me see if I get some of where's my boxes out here."
"11647730","11649910"," This thing is pissing me off man."
"11652730","11654570"," This thing is pissing me off to no end. "
"11655990","11658110"," Probably be checking down here at least."
"11659610","11661490"," And then looking for some consolidation."
"11662270","11662490"," Okay. "
"11663250","11666630"," Uh, but only I'm saying, only say that because the daily is still kind of weak."
"11667870","11670650"," So I'd be like, we'll do this right now."
"11670690","11671350"," We'll just try them out. "
"11671630","11672350"," Let's make it simple."
"11674230","11675850"," I'll be looking for something like this."
"11677630","11681790"," Hopefully you get some consolidation and a tag higher here. "
"11686500","11687240"," Somewhere in there."
"11687340","11688700"," We'll see how that works itself out."
"11689100","11690660"," It's still kind of in a free fall. "
"11690660","11692780"," Another issue here is that it's not overtaken."
"11692900","11693180"," It's hourly."
"11693420","11695300"," You got some negative daily velocity here. "
"11695660","11697700"," I'd be really concerned with this one to be honest with you."
"11699140","11700420"," I'd be really concerned."
"11701440","11702500"," No, this is negative. "
"11704120","11706800"," Your daily is not looking good right now."
"11709260","11712860"," Matter of fact, um, not quite ready."
"11718840","11720440"," I'm not buying it right now. "
"11721500","11725680"," Matter of fact, I would not be bullish on this personally."
"11727060","11730140"," And you can't even tell that that might not even get up there."
"11730300","11733920"," So, um, not ready yet. "
"11733920","11736260"," In my view, just my personal opinion."
"11736860","11739560"," Don't take this as, as, as truth."
"11739660","11743680"," But if this, this, uh, daily down here looks like it's not done. "
"11743980","11744800"," See this right here?"
"11745840","11748480"," See that down there, that last move down below."
"11749460","11750720"," Watch my cursor down there."
"11750940","11752260"," I think you're still going down here. "
"11753820","11754620"," That's NYCB."
"11756520","11757480"," What else we got here?"
"11757760","11758160"," SMH."
"11758320","11759260"," We'll do SMH next. "
"11765880","11766680"," Oh, baby."
"11766820","11767900"," We already did this one, didn't we?"
"11768680","11769840"," We already done this one."
"11772120","11772400"," Right?"
"11772480","11773980"," Right down here is the box, right?"
"11774640","11775220"," Consolidating here. "
"11776060","11778600"," Uh, I don't like this role here at all."
"11779640","11781800"," I don't like SMH either."
"11783240","11785600"," Uh, consolidating on its daily trend. "
"11787060","11789440"," Uh, I don't like this flattening out of trend here."
"11791660","11798040"," Uh, it's possible, it's possible if price gets above 240."
"11799180","11803440"," Uh, if price gets above 240, you can put a buy in here possibly, but you'd have to have tight"
"11803440","11807060"," stops underneath it because it looks like it wants to come back down here. "
"11808820","11813980"," And you'd have to be really scared of taking a trade here because if this yellow line rolls over,"
"11814180","11815820"," it could be very dangerous."
"11816680","11817580"," See that right there?"
"11817680","11818380"," You don't want to get underneath."
"11819860","11821520"," Uh, see that bloodbath right there?"
"11822180","11826020"," You would see something like, you know, something like this under here. "
"11826700","11831600"," So maybe what we'll do is we'll probably put a better place to look somewhere down in here."
"11833620","11834980"," Yeah, somewhere down in here."
"11838500","11841300"," I'd be looking, personally, I'd be looking for like 210. "
"11842840","11843660"," Right there, 210."
"11849820","11850700"," Next one."
"11851760","11861700"," Now this can be invalidated if price gets above 240 and holds in the one and five coming underneath"
"11861700","11861900"," it. "
"11861980","11866700"," You could have another trade above 255 on the VANX semiconductors."
"11867960","11869040"," Uh, snow."
"11875540","11877200"," Wow, snow, man. "
"11878080","11881460"," It's got crushed down there, not done selling off on snow."
"11882720","11886400"," Uh, could be, look for some consolidation here, possibly."
"11887020","11888400"," This is getting more bullish, more bullish. "
"11889180","11891560"," I'd be checking for consolidation on snow here."
"11896030","11897790"," You need time for consolidation here."
"11897910","11898430"," You can see it. "
"11903040","11905180"," You need time for some consolidation."
"11905840","11908420"," Uh, this is interesting."
"11908860","11910500"," Snow, snowflakes interesting here. "
"11911500","11915280"," Uh, the one danger here is the same thing that's showing itself on tech and spy."
"11915960","11920700"," And that's that you have the daily and the, uh, believe that's weekly."
"11921360","11922620"," Yeah, it's weekly coming underneath. "
"11923360","11924820"," But this is all good here too."
"11925020","11928480"," I mean, guess if you're, if you're a tech bull snowflake consolidating down here."
"11929700","11930520"," It's in the same. "
"11931740","11935740"," When you guys see me look at spy, when you guys see me look at like, uh, Tesla."
"11936580","11938200"," So this all looks the same, man."
"11938340","11939320"," None of this shit looks any different. "
"11939380","11940520"," So you guys are calling out tickers."
"11941360","11942680"," It's pretty much the same thing."
"11942980","11946300"," Uh, this is either consolidation or we're going to roll the fuck out of this market down. "
"11947100","11948080"," To be honest with you."
"11948640","11951760"," This looks healthier than spy or to, than Tesla to some extent."
"11953320","11956940"," This gives some credence to maybe tech, tech being fine or so much tech being fine. "
"11956940","11963600"," And Tesla decoupling from the stock market, but, uh, danger in here for sure."
"11964060","11964460"," Trap."
"11964640","11967460"," I see traps for bulls and bears on snow. "
"11972710","11973850"," Have it laboratories."
"11975110","11981560"," The second here."
"11983280","11987580"," Now that laboratories, uh, bullish on the daily are becoming bullish. "
"11988320","11989180"," Bullish on the hourly."
"11989980","11992520"," I like, I like the stock right now."
"11993780","11994980"," I like ABT. "
"11995740","11998500"," I like it a lot right now."
"11998960","11999880"," I like that it's over."
"12000080","12000520"," It's hourly. "
"12000980","12001720"," I like that it's over."
"12001940","12002260"," It's minute."
"12002500","12003180"," It's five minutes. "
"12003740","12004360"," I like that."
"12004440","12006820"," I like that the daily is starting to turn higher."
"12006820","12008340"," I like that the hourly is turning. "
"12008340","12009040"," I was a good one."
"12009440","12010440"," I recall this one out."
"12010600","12010960"," Good job. "
"12012060","12012900"," It's a good one."
"12013260","12014620"," It's a nice ticker right there."
"12016460","12017540"," Very good ticker. "
"12018680","12021680"," You have some negative velocity in the high here."
"12021680","12023800"," So here's where your problem is."
"12024700","12025860"," Is that you've got. "
"12026780","12027520"," Some negative."
"12027660","12029100"," This is showing the market again."
"12029140","12030620"," You can actually see this in the market. "
"12031340","12033420"," Uh, this is a no go zone in here."
"12035060","12036060"," No go zone."
"12036980","12039880"," There's a trap in here for bulls for sure. "
"12042720","12045840"," Uh, you don't want to see like a move like this, right?"
"12046040","12047820"," Like you're like hell, this is super bullish here."
"12048320","12051100"," You buy this and then you get bloodbath down."
"12052180","12058480"," So that trade is, um, you know, it's not a permanent trade in any way, shape, or form. "
"12058740","12060300"," You know, you can see that it's."
"12061000","12062080"," It's setting up."
"12062240","12064620"," This is setting up the market rolling over right here, right?"
"12064760","12065120"," You see that?"
"12066460","12069680"," Uh, so short term bullish long term danger. "
"12070300","12076220"," You don't want to pick up Abbott laboratories either after this until it gets above."
"12077160","12080500"," Uh, all of this nonsense right here."
"12080500","12082120"," Very dangerous volatility here. "
"12084200","12087340"," Uh, very, very dangerous in here for Abbott laboratories."
"12089500","12094180"," If you're looking at T off in short, man, that's a prime candidate."
"12095700","12098000"," It really is with stops above. "
"12104940","12106420"," Uh, ABT."
"12107360","12108080"," UEC."
"12108580","12109180"," We'll look at UEC. "
"12116040","12116760"," Nope."
"12117700","12119600"," You guys there."
"12120480","12123180"," It's always awesome to see what you guys are feeling on stuff. "
"12124440","12125660"," Because it's cool, right?"
"12125920","12126800"," Because you're like, hey, I'm full."
"12127660","12129720"," I'm feeling pretty, uh, our bear."
"12129920","12130640"," Bullish right now. "
"12130900","12131760"," Same kind of a story."
"12132780","12135780"," Uh, we're below the hourly on UEC."
"12136860","12137880"," Trading fee dollars. "
"12138920","12142620"," Um, I'd be interested in something below."
"12143940","12146080"," On UEC, possibly right here."
"12147240","12148720"," You don't want to see this break. "
"12153550","12155570"," Uh, boom, boom, boom, boom."
"12155570","12157690"," And your weekly is keeping you."
"12157770","12159150"," There is a squeeze play in here. "
"12161270","12162750"," There is a squeeze play."
"12162850","12163650"," It's going to take time."
"12164510","12165530"," It's possible. "
"12165750","12168310"," So this right here, you have to have stops underneath."
"12175590","12176890"," Hard stops too."
"12178170","12184990"," Uh, what a bull wants to see is consolidation in time. "
"12186270","12187730"," And then you get your squeeze."
"12188510","12190910"," You want to see all this stuff come down and get underneath."
"12191550","12193130"," Get the help that you need. "
"12193990","12196890"," Uh, and you probably have a trade somewhere around."
"12199450","12200210"," For tennis."
"12201450","12202950"," That's what I'm looking for right there. "
"12204770","12206670"," Oh, that is UEC."
"12209370","12209810"," Coin."
"12210370","12211770"," I always felt bad for coin. "
"12212870","12214890"," Uh, coin always pissed me off."
"12215110","12217510"," I was like, I was like, what do you care about coin base?"
"12217510","12220210"," Like, they make money regardless of where all this goes."
"12222750","12225470"," And they just kind of shit on coin, which they shouldn't have. "
"12226230","12227330"," Oh, this is nice."
"12227610","12228370"," I like this dude."
"12229470","12231810"," What the fuck is going on here?"
"12232330","12233730"," Wow, this could be explosive. "
"12234810","12235890"," Okay, so coin."
"12237310","12239170"," Uh, wow."
"12239810","12240550"," Coin man. "
"12242570","12244550"," Coin could be a great strangle."
"12245310","12249830"," Uh, coin makes for a great strangle here."
"12256260","12258040"," This is a really good ticker right now. "
"12259520","12260820"," This is an excellent ticker."
"12260900","12261560"," I'll be honest with you."
"12262280","12264380"," Very vol, you have volatility coming your way. "
"12264440","12265380"," I don't know if you know that or not."
"12266060","12268980"," You've got some pretty fierce coiling going on in here."
"12272100","12273540"," Um, fierce coiling. "
"12276510","12277510"," This could be a printer."
"12278830","12279750"," Like a burr printer."
"12284330","12286050"," Good one on coin, man. "
"12286870","12294450"," Um, it's looking bearish currently my, my, my point or my, my, here's my take on coin."
"12295150","12300070"," Uh, if you want what I think is going to happen, I would take the trade down."
"12303490","12306770"," On coin, uh, to 20 bucks, believe it or not. "
"12308930","12312370"," And I'm saying that because the daily is going down here."
"12312370","12314790"," Your hourly is going down here."
"12315710","12316910"," Enter day stuff. "
"12319550","12320190"," Yeah."
"12320970","12322070"," Where are you at right here?"
"12323650","12326470"," Maybe even lower, uh, 15 to 20 bucks."
"12327430","12328710"," Price target on coin. "
"12333810","12335830"," Uh, it can go higher though."
"12336350","12337770"," Um, bullish on coin above."
"12339210","12342290"," Uh, 64 79 with hard stops underneath. "
"12343850","12350530"," My, my, my, um, my thought here is that it's lower though."
"12354240","12356460"," Much lower actually violently lower."
"12359770","12360890"," Uh, CRM. "
"12371440","12372280"," Gorgeous squeeze."
"12373060","12375780"," One, two, three, four, five triggers right here."
"12375980","12377520"," See the explosiveness in that move?"
"12378380","12378900"," Outstanding. "
"12380240","12381700"," Uh, what's next for CRM?"
"12381820","12383640"," Look at that beautiful trade up there to 192."
"12384280","12384800"," Gorgeous."
"12385080","12385640"," This is beautiful. "
"12385920","12387660"," This is coin basically, right?"
"12388580","12390420"," And I want you to see this right here."
"12390580","12392000"," This nice move right here."
"12392080","12394660"," This nice explosiveness in the hourly right here. "
"12394940","12398380"," Great huge move, but you're above support, right?"
"12398540","12399720"," This is a key point here."
"12400120","12400980"," Is that you're above."
"12401120","12404660"," And that was the point on coin is that price needs to be above. "
"12405560","12408260"," Uh, these five triggers and it was and it squeezed higher."
"12408680","12412440"," What are you waiting for now on coin is a chance for the hourly."
"12412440","12414140"," To move higher. "
"12415040","12416560"," So it's going to take time."
"12417280","12420260"," And you watch your daily and weekly to move higher."
"12420400","12421700"," That's going to actually take time. "
"12421980","12423860"," So the trade here in my view is over."
"12424660","12427720"," Um, but if price ever holds above."
"12430000","12431660"," If price holds above. "
"12434440","12435000"," 192."
"12435840","12438760"," And you give time for momentum to catch up and get above."
"12438760","12445660"," Uh, if it holds above here and you get time for momentum, maybe look at this ticker back in maybe"
"12445660","12447100"," a week into March or something. "
"12447820","12454060"," Uh, maybe even late March, you might get another, um, another good, good squeeze plate trade out of"
"12454060","12454180"," this."
"12454560","12455500"," It's actually pretty good."
"12456660","12457820"," Something like this. "
"12459760","12463740"," Uh, and then something like this."
"12466000","12467600"," And then you get your move higher."
"12468760","12470860"," This is good, but it's going to take some time consolidation. "
"12472720","12473520"," I like it."
"12473880","12474800"," I like the stock."
"12475620","12476980"," It's very bullish, man. "
"12477780","12478560"," Very good."
"12478580","12479620"," I like this stock a lot."
"12480100","12481660"," Good, good, good pick right there. "
"12483280","12484940"," Um, still looks the same."
"12485220","12487120"," Still looks the same as the rest of the market though."
"12487700","12488740"," Be warned here, right?"
"12489120","12492580"," You get the market rolls over market conditions roll over. "
"12493720","12497120"," Uh, so if we get that market move down lower here and that rejects."
"12500270","12501950"," Uh, price target down below."
"12506140","12507220"," Uh, 107. "
"12507720","12508520"," Can you take that hit?"
"12508660","12509020"," I don't know."
"12509240","12510300"," Maybe you can't really can't."
"12510640","12512100"," Uh, so this is another take. "
"12512220","12512520"," This is a great."
"12512680","12513800"," That's a great move right there."
"12514880","12516260"," Uh, but you need to get up. "
"12516520","12517260"," You need to be up one."
"12517660","12517680"," One."
"12519160","12522120"," EC president on the land, the White House on March 10. "
"12522220","12523180"," There's no trade here."
"12523460","12525480"," The next trade is above 195."
"12526560","12527760"," Uh, with stops below. "
"12530020","12530660"," Makes sense."
"12530880","12533200"," You want time in here to get this up in here."
"12533260","12533940"," The trade is complete. "
"12534980","12537760"," Uh, you'd be waiting for this to form up above on CRM."
"12540500","12541220"," That's CRM."
"12541300","12541920"," Yeah, CRM. "
"12544540","12544940"," INTC."
"12547680","12548400"," These are all the."
"12548520","12550200"," You guys are calling out the same tickers. "
"12551520","12552440"," You guys are all."
"12552880","12554020"," Oh, look at the INTC."
"12554300","12555200"," We already did this one, right?"
"12555200","12557320"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright. "
"12557840","12562220"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear order flame futures, forex and stock instruments."
"12562840","12565400"," Here's your trial at Ticksright.com."
"12565780","12567540"," This is your by the dip consolidation."
"12568740","12570300"," You don't want to see this path. "
"12570440","12572500"," You're already seeing the path to work itself out, right?"
"12573240","12574900"," You already see the path working itself out."
"12575060","12580300"," You've got bearishness coming down by the dip above 31 hasn't happened yet, right?"
"12581220","12582100"," Hasn't happened yet, right?"
"12582560","12585760"," You got by the dip here, but look what's happening here."
"12585860","12587640"," You've got negativity coming down to the market. "
"12587840","12592220"," These are all when you guys look at this stuff, it's all setting up for the same shit, right?"
"12593540","12594680"," It's all setting up."
"12594820","12596080"," Now there is some development here."
"12596100","12600620"," You could probably at this point get rid of this by the dip because we never got above there. "
"12601460","12603300"," And you'd be looking for something like this."
"12604120","12605640"," You want to see price get above."
"12608690","12611890"," You want to see price get above this orange one right here and start to take out. "
"12611890","12616210"," First Bostik says we need to have some kind of a slowdown in the labor market, but not"
"12616210","12617830"," catastrophic."
"12619270","12623790"," So slow and steady changes in policy should reduce the risk of a hard outcome."
"12624290","12628770"," This is a business that say they are expecting to ratchet down the pace of wage increases, but"
"12628770","12629750"," still plan to add workers. "
"12629750","12635170"," Bostik says it's appropriate to be cautious so the Fed does not, does enough to control inflation,"
"12635650","12637970"," but does not do more than what we need to do."
"12638290","12642490"," Bostik says business is specific, demand is strong and concerns are more macro-related."
"12643910","12644650"," Specific to their firm. "
"12645430","12648730"," Bostik says a considerable risk is now roughly balanced."
"12649550","12654110"," And the debate is underway about how much influence the policy is having in the current economy."
"12655030","12660830"," Bostik says the meat in the quarter points camp for pace of wage hikes and policy should continue"
"12660830","12662130"," to fight through the spring. "
"12662990","12666370"," Bostik says they have seen some at twice."
"12675260","12681020"," Bostik says they have seen some of the situation of inflation but need to remain a risk for a"
"12681020","12682340"," resolution of fighting inflation."
"12682340","12686020"," And Bostik says the Fed may have to remain a given high inflation. "
"12693510","12695570"," Watch in the hourly velocity."
"12696250","12697770"," Hey, guess what's happening here, guys."
"12698310","12699650"," Check out this hourly velocity. "
"12701110","12702730"," Who's making money here?"
"12704230","12706790"," Did you hear me say the hourly velocity?"
"12707150","12708110"," What time is it right now?"
"12708370","12710350"," It's 1.36 in the afternoon."
"12710790","12712750"," I'm looking for a move in the market on the upside."
"12714650","12716250"," Where are we trading now?"

"12728590","12730230"," What's happening out there?"
"12732590","12734490"," What time was I looking for?"
"12735090","12736310"," $1.30 in the afternoon."
"12736310","12737590"," How are you doing out there?"
"12738070","12738750"," Can you feel it?"
"12739670","12740950"," Do you feel it now?"
"12742310","12743790"," You feel it now?"
"12751120","12752440"," How does that feel?"
"12755900","12756920"," Who's short?"
"12772070","12773430"," Oh, man. "
"12774150","12774810"," Take your money."
"12776050","12777370"," Get out of here."
"12778230","12779370"," Go play a girlfriend something. "
"12779830","12780910"," Go play a boyfriend something."
"12783420","12785540"," Does anybody want to mark the time?"
"12786560","12789120"," When I showed you the hourly trigger on spy."
"12790960","12794260"," And I said to you, I'm going to show you what's going to happen here. "
"12796920","12798800"," I'm going to show you exactly what's going to happen."
"12801540","12804040"," So if you're looking at that hourly trigger back there, right?"
"12804200","12805940"," I'll show you the past two previous times."
"12806180","12807900"," I'm going to put my little pen over there, my crayons. "
"12810620","12812540"," And I'm going to show you exactly what to expect."
"12812800","12813300"," How'd that feel?"
"12813800","12814860"," That feels good, right?"
"12822020","12822960"," How'd that feel?"
"12829100","12830740"," Hourly trigger check."
"12831360","12833120"," Hourly velocity check. "
"12834580","12834910"," Bongo."
"12850210","12853630"," Don't forget it was a 139 in the afternoon."
"12853750","12857810"," So 139 in the afternoon. "
"12858130","12859670"," Now we're in a cluster of triggers."
"12860870","12861930"," Now we're still in the afternoon."
"12861930","12865090"," We're sitting on the weekly, the hourly. "
"12865770","12867570"," This is where the rejection was right up in here."
"12868190","12869390"," Weekly hourly."
"12871090","12873250"," And now we've got above us. "
"12873770","12877790"," 396.98 is the next one up here."
"12878730","12880670"," 396.98 above."
"12884390","12885070"," Right. "
"12885290","12886050"," There's another one."
"12888130","12889490"," Oh boy."
"12892370","12892930"," Smashing. "
"12896250","12897590"," Like a gunshot would."
"12900130","12903570"," So we did see some upside movement in the S&P 500."
"12903630","12905110"," Yeah, we stopped that movement bro. "
"12905290","12906670"," The Fed's Bostik's comments there."
"12907230","12907850"," We saw it."
"12908110","12909650"," It's not Fed Bostik's comments. "
"12911410","12913990"," Sorry, not Fed Bostik's comments."
"12915450","12919170"," So this text released from Bostik wasn't scheduled as he did just speak to reporters."
"12919170","12922730"," They're just going to go over the key headlines from Fed Bostik there. "
"12923010","12927590"," So he says it is appropriate to be cautious so that the Fed does enough to control inflation, but"
"12927590","12929210"," does not do more than we need to do."
"12929570","12934150"," And he says I'm firmly in the quarter point camp when it comes to rate height pace."
"12934430","12939350"," The policy should begin to bite in the spring, as the Fed may have to do more given high inflation,"
"12939930","12944910"," strong jobs market, and won't decide on the proper policy path. "
"12948170","12949590"," Way up there."
"12951510","12952870"," Way up there."
"12954710","12955890"," We'll look at you guys. "
"12955890","12957610"," Get your pens and papers out at home."
"12957610","12958130"," Look at that."
"12958750","12961170"," Look at that move, baby. "
"12964150","12965550"," Look at that move."
"12966510","12967970"," My heart is working."
"12968330","12970810"," That's Bostik is not a voting member this year. "
"12972370","12975510"," You guys remember why Bostik's not a voting member anymore?"
"12977350","12980010"," It's because he got caught fucking trading in the market."
"12983830","12985210"," Does anybody remember that?"
"12988500","12990900"," Okay, so we got the spy, baby."
"12991960","12992520"," Right?"
"12992680","12993960"," We got our moves in the spy. "
"12994500","13000000"," You know we're green in the week now, right?"
"13003140","13005140"," Okay, so look what happened here, right?"
"13005960","13008080"," Slammed right up into the hourly."
"13008440","13009540"," See the hourly right here?"
"13010400","13011420"," See the top of the key."
"13011700","13013120"," Remember we talked about the top of this earlier?"
"13013420","13016440"," Three ninety five sixty two, almost a perfect pin strike. "
"13017160","13024120"," Now we need time for the five and one minute to catch up and create a four trigger cluster."
"13025000","13029840"," We're going to try to attempt to grab three ninety six ninety three, right?"
"13029840","13035480"," And then the big bad boy above the daily trigger at four oh one thirty eight."
"13036700","13038320"," Now I warned you here. "
"13038460","13040380"," Okay, I want you to see see something here."
"13040560","13043380"," We just we just expelled all that explosiveness."
"13044640","13045160"," Right?"
"13045500","13046320"," So look down here. "
"13046500","13046760"," Okay."
"13047500","13051260"," On this hourly we use we use up all of our power here."
"13051260","13051660"," Okay. "
"13052300","13055080"," But we have a little bit more left to go higher here."
"13055140","13055680"," Do you see this?"
"13056220","13059220"," We still haven't become bullish on the hourly yet."
"13059720","13063280"," So we've got to just give it some time and see if we can make another leg higher at some"
"13063280","13063600"," point. "
"13064160","13065840"," What do we want to see happen?"
"13069520","13071280"," Three ninety five twenty nine."
"13071680","13072660"," So right here."
"13075540","13077480"," Three ninety five twenty nine. "
"13082400","13082880"," Okay."
"13084060","13085760"," We hit all of our targets were done."
"13087480","13090440"," We want I'm going to show you exactly what we want to see happen here. "
"13092300","13096400"," We want to see happen as you want to see the white line catch up."
"13097000","13097760"," And price."
"13098640","13099660"," To catch up. "
"13099800","13101900"," So watch watch my watch my cursor here."
"13102540","13104900"," As the famous Mr. Yen would say."
"13105840","13107180"," You want to see price. "
"13108020","13109700"," Catch up and stay above."
"13110920","13114620"," You want to see price consolidate here for next leg higher."
"13115240","13117620"," And the next leg hot next leg higher. "
"13117940","13119320"," I'm going to give you the target for that."
"13120420","13123560"," You want you want to hold this level right here."
"13123840","13125040"," This is the hourly trigger. "
"13126100","13130960"," And you want to you want to you want to stay above this hourly trigger and have the one in"
"13130960","13132160"," five minute catch up."
"13132280","13132560"," Okay."
"13133180","13136900"," Now what would be the next price target after this is going to be. "
"13138920","13140960"," Three ninety six ninety two."
"13150740","13153180"," Dude waiting to you guys get this stuff man."
"13153200","13154360"," You're going to be so stoked. "
"13155300","13158480"," You're going to be like you're going to come right in the stream and be like Hey cap."
"13158700","13158880"," Hey cap."
"13159060","13159640"," It's happening, bro. "
"13160280","13162140"," You might get an explosive move up here."
"13170500","13171680"," Just give it some time."
"13172080","13173800"," And now it just needs a little bit of time. "
"13174380","13175340"," What are you doing here?"
"13175560","13177520"," You're like, okay, we got our we tagged it."
"13181480","13183100"," And so what are we looking for here?"
"13184760","13185940"," We already said it right."
"13186200","13188120"," We need to eat some consolidation here. "
"13190500","13190980"," Consolidation."
"13191520","13194080"," We want price to work its way back up."
"13194960","13195440"," Right. "
"13195660","13197520"," Then we want that cluster of three here."
"13198220","13201260"," And then we'll get that next explosive move up right there."
"13201360","13201500"," Right. "
"13201740","13203340"," If we don't if we don't consolidate here."
"13204240","13205540"," The trade is over."
"13205740","13205900"," Right. "
"13206120","13208740"," We know though that the hourly is still pretty bullish right now."
"13208780","13210480"," It's extremely bullish to be honest with you."
"13211680","13216700"," So what we're looking for here is the retest and a new high right. "
"13217420","13218740"," Retest and new high."
"13219040","13220480"," Remember that right in the one minute."
"13220840","13222280"," We're looking for the retest. "
"13223780","13224780"," On the one minute."
"13226940","13227820"," With price."
"13229800","13232260"," And we're looking for a new high in the next move. "
"13232500","13233020"," Believe it or not."
"13233180","13233960"," That's it right there."
"13234000","13236840"," So you're looking for momentum to catch up. "
"13237200","13239220"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"13239580","13240180"," Get free."
"13248280","13250820"," And then there's just slam up higher. "
"13251340","13251700"," Okay."
"13251840","13253940"," Anything below this invalidates the trade."
"13253940","13254420"," Okay. "
"13254880","13257620"," And validated below."
"13257920","13259480"," So I'm looking for this one right here."
"13259700","13260800"," This is where I'm looking for. "
"13261700","13264460"," Right there is what I'm looking for right there to take that trade."
"13264740","13266440"," Get this meat and this juice right here."
"13266480","13266740"," Okay. "
"13269960","13271580"," So we'll watch this one next."
"13271860","13273160"," You guys know what to look for."
"13276510","13278470"," Look at that move, baby. "
"13279130","13279850"," How that feel."
"13281570","13282630"," How does it feel?"
"13283250","13284250"," Let me know in the chat."
"13284690","13285390"," How does it feel?"
"13285970","13288250"," Does that feel invigorating for you?"
"13306890","13307410"," Yeah. "
"13307630","13309290"," Bostik was an insider trader, man."
"13309550","13310610"," Someone had to fall."
"13310810","13315170"," So he was already thinking about making money out in the free market. "
"13316730","13318850"," And but they were all doing it."
"13318850","13320370"," Like they were all fucking doing it."
"13320450","13321790"," They were all inside trading. "
"13322150","13323230"," Jerome Powell was."
"13324050","13325970"," And they needed someone to take the fall."
"13326330","13327970"," But there was already talk of him getting out anyways. "
"13328790","13331310"," Or I think he was in the nomination maybe for Fed President."
"13331550","13333830"," They were like, there's no fucking way he's going to be Fed President."
"13334490","13335850"," He would have crashed the market. "
"13336210","13339790"," And you know the President and the yelling and all these people aren't going to allow that to"
"13339790","13340070"," happen."
"13340770","13344270"," So once he was probably out of the running, they said, you're going to fall on this night for us."
"13345510","13348130"," I think I think that's what was some of the talk that was going on. "
"13354580","13356380"," So it's great not to be holding puts."
"13368600","13370640"," My panties got wet in that move."
"13374480","13375340"," Very nice. "
"13377360","13378240"," Very nice."
"13382560","13383860"," So what are we looking for?"
"13383960","13386760"," We're going to test now in the one minute test in the one minute."
"13387260","13389620"," We want to get above the hourly next, right?"
"13389760","13390400"," This is the hourly trigger. "
"13390580","13391440"," We got the one hour test."
"13392340","13396300"," I don't trust this move personally right now, but I want to see us get above the hourly."
"13396780","13399040"," I want to see the best trade here. "
"13399180","13400540"," The truthfully, the best trade here."
"13400980","13402500"," If there was like a best trade."
"13404660","13406300"," But you want like the best set up. "
"13407160","13409040"," On this trade is this one right here."
"13409220","13411000"," You wait right now for this to come up."
"13412540","13417340"," You wait for the five minutes to come up, the one minute to come up. "
"13418700","13423040"," And then you even if price goes higher here, you want to wait for it to come back down and"
"13423040","13423920"," touch these three."
"13424460","13425560"," Like that one right."
"13425780","13427760"," Like this is the key trade right there. "
"13428140","13429140"," Take a snapshot of that."
"13429620","13431460"," That's like the power move right there."
"13431520","13433160"," If we can get it, that's a power move. "
"13433900","13438340"," You're going to have the one, the five, the hourly and momentum just on it."
"13438340","13441260"," This will go, this will go out of the moon if you see something like this happen."
"13442720","13444200"," So just just be patient. "
"13444800","13445720"," Watch this unfold."
"13446660","13447460"," Give it some time."
"13447500","13448520"," Relax and let it breathe. "
"13449740","13454560"," Like a, like a glass of what does, what does South Park say in San Francisco."
"13455340","13457780"," Grab a cup and pour yourself a glass full of smug."
"13472560","13478100"," If Chaz is watching the video right now, if you can go back in and snip out that part of"
"13478100","13483260"," the video where I said, we're looking for an explosive move higher in the hourly velocity. "
"13484340","13486580"," Hourly momentum, not the trigger, but the momentum."
"13491730","13493570"," Wasn't a trigger, it was a momentum in the background."
"13496350","13497950"," Oh, Chet, and I just saw your comment, man. "
"13498170","13498950"," Sorry brother, I missed it."
"13527600","13528480"," Explosive moves."
"13530700","13533300"," Explosive moves on the, on the spy right here. "
"13533860","13535640"," I never got any more cheap calls there."
"13535700","13536160"," I'm like, come on."
"13536240","13538080"," I'll just give you those cheap calls down there. "
"13538120","13539520"," I'll totally fucking load up on those."
"13540000","13541360"," I know we're going up here."
"13544620","13554460"," Next target above 396.92. Just waiting for the one minute to catch up"
"13554460","13554720"," here. "
"13555400","13556820"," Five minutes to catch up here."
"13562760","13564160"," Your panties got wet."
"13574660","13592610"," Thanks for"
"13592610","13593670"," posting that in chat, Chaton. "
"13594530","13595010"," Cheating."
"13595690","13599710"," So in time of this time now, we're expecting to take comments from Feds Waller who discusses the"
"13599710","13600870"," economic outlook."
"13603750","13609110"," So this is during a virtual event hosted by the mid-sized bank coalition of American Text is"
"13609110","13611390"," expected as well as a Q&A from Moderator. "
"13611630","13613110"," We do have the link to the Zoom video."
"13613110","13614670"," We will get it out shortly."
"13615070","13619490"," But do be aware though, the Fed website does say he's supposed to be speaking of 4 p.m. Eastern"
"13619490","13619810"," time. "
"13620170","13620890"," Yeah, we can see."
"13620910","13621870"," We can tell them."
"13622230","13623210"," Time to just keep heads up. "
"13624190","13630410"," We murdered some puts all the 300,000 puts at 393 or now worth 17 cents."
"13630870","13631710"," They got hammered."
"13653080","13657620"," We've got now have price trading above the one, the five, the hourly. "
"13659500","13662060"," Three trigger cluster with price above here."
"13664780","13674750"," Just look at that big old green D.I.L.D.O. We want to"
"13674750","13677730"," get now that we've interacted with the one minute, we want to get a new high."
"13678790","13683950"," If we don't get the new high after 395 90, we're going to go back down and test the five"
"13683950","13684230"," minute. "
"13687390","13689230"," Just ripped face there."
"13690530","13692090"," Just ripped face."
"13701760","13704580"," I didn't put the question out of a vert. "
"13704940","13706500"," Let me go ask the question right now."
"13708860","13712520"," Now trade where we need a new high right now office one minute."
"13712600","13716180"," If we don't get it, we're going to come back down and check this five minute. "
"13716440","13718380"," We can put the post the question out there."
"13719420","13720840"," And ask people and send to it."

"13923160","13930140"," What will happen is it'll roll over here and the five minute will actually catch up. "
"13930220","13931700"," The one minute will come over here."
"13933040","13937740"," You'll see consolidation and then you'll actually get your explosive move higher here."

"16522220","16532180"," date puts Down into tomorrow in a bloodbath Uh, so let me figure that out Let's say you put"
"16532180","16539119"," a call spread on here not you but me maybe put a call spread on for tomorrow here And then"
"16539119","16544840"," as we come into the close if we do squeeze up before close To the idea here would be put"
"16544840","16551919"," a call spread on for tomorrow Whether this happens now or overnight you'd be okay Now if we do go"
"16551919","16557099"," up here overnight, you could then put the put side on just like zero date puts here Uh, you'd get"
"16557099","16561740"," the burr print on your call spreads and then you'd have some protection to the downside tomorrow I"
"16561740","16563919"," don't know if that makes sense or not."
"16564119","16569580"," Maybe it's like calls right here for tomorrow And then uh puts if something happens, so maybe it's"
"16569580","16572380"," a str- I don't know if it's a strangle over to What will you do here?"
"16572439","16575560"," I know there's there is a trade here Have to think about this for me."
"16575660","16576140"," Give me five minutes. "

"16591349","16592130"," How do you capture that?"
"16593810","16599110"," And then you don't want to be in like one day puts here and have a squeeze higher right and"
"16599110","16605210"," then then you kind of get fucked Um, maybe the idea would be just over here you put the call"
"16605210","16613810"," spread on and then add puts Uh add one day puts below below 395 61 It's like a call spread"
"16613810","16614349"," right here."
"16614830","16619750"," And then if prideless, let's see put a call spread out here We start to trade down Then you'd you'd"

"16623830","16625189"," I can't figure it out right now."
"16625250","16632689"," Maybe somebody's got a better idea than I do I'd have to do the math on it too and see"
"16632689","16637990"," what the call spreads pay versus the puts for tomorrow Like what would you lost like if the puts"
"16637990","16641669"," don't print and they go to zero There's a call spread covered."
"16641790","16645810"," I guess would be the important question You have like they got the math. "
