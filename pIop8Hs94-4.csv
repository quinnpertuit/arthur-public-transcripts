"336320","338120"," If you're the kind of trader that's like."
"339240","340060"," I don't know."
"340920","345300"," It's it's if you're the kind of trade that's like I buy calls and I buy puts or a."
"345580","348620"," I only sell calls or I only sell puts or. "
"350820","353480"," I haven't seen this in a while."
"354100","354820"," We got to be honest."
"356660","360040"," We were talking about it earlier in the week and it's culminating into a Friday. "
"362520","366060"," And so I was just in the phone with Joe Donut and I was like, well, I'm buying a bunch"
"366060","366320"," of."
"366600","369800"," I'm buying a bunch of 420 P's for Monday right now."
"370140","371440"," We're going to talk about that. "
"373460","374200"," That trade."
"374400","376060"," I'm going to trade right now and."
"376900","378180"," We're going to chat about it. "
"378320","378520"," So."
"379700","382820"," Earlier this morning, last half an hour an hour or so."
"384120","387800"," Now we came in to retest this hourly trigger. "
"389260","392140"," And I said to Joe this morning, I said."
"394300","395420"," They were cool over here."
"396000","397380"," I said, I'm going to buy some puts. "
"399520","402260"," I said, if we break above and start to head higher."
"403400","404240"," I'll cut them loose."
"406260","409120"," And I'll add them on the at the end of the day. "
"409580","411720"," So I was like, I'll add them this morning on the open."
"413460","418660"," And if we retest the hourly trigger and we go higher, I'll cut them loose."
"421140","423980"," And but I still add them by end of day. "
"424120","426720"," If we squeeze higher and start trading higher into the close today."
"427980","429020"," Now we didn't."
"429120","430740"," We kept rolling to the downside. "
"431020","432140"," Rejected started going to the downside."
"433400","436120"," I'm only up 22 cents right now."
"436120","439560"," So even all of this blood right here. "
"441120","442760"," I'm not making a ton of money."
"443000","443920"," This whole move right here."
"444040","444340"," I've made. "
"446720","447660"," Five cents."
"448600","449960"," That's what I've made right now."
"450120","452360"," This whole this whole move down right now. "
"452420","453240"," I've made five cents."
"455880","457260"," So puts are expensive."
"457740","459220"," Someone said it in the stream yesterday. "
"460020","460800"," What's expensive?"
"461300","462720"," Everybody's fucking hedged out of their ass."
"464740","466500"," They're hedged for the 20th."
"467080","468540"," They're not hedged for today. "
"468700","471060"," They're hedged for the 20th of October."
"472220","477960"," I put a gamma expiring on the notional expiring post up on Twitter this morning."
"479440","481840"," And today we got a bunch of calls expiring. "
"482760","486040"," So we could see a rip at the end of the day or on Monday."
"487960","493500"," But we do have that the market is very hedged into the 20th of October."
"494600","496480"," And we're in this weird place. "
"498160","499740"," We're in this weird place where."
"501060","507560"," We're at the where the bottom of the market were oversold right over the crazy oversold."
"507920","510180"," Well, I will look at that too if we're oversold or not. "
"511260","513960"," But we were I should say we were oversold."
"514700","517340"," And we're heading into the earnings season."
"517340","524080"," And whenever you like, not every time, whenever you sell in the earnings season, like you're"
"524080","526020"," selling heavy and hard into earnings season. "
"528560","534700"," And knowing that analysts are they don't suck, but they're they're wrong."
"536400","539860"," Often that they're wrong and not negatively."
"540220","542840"," They're wrong about 60 to 70% of the time. "
"543660","551020"," Where they they give you what they think is was going to be the earnings reports and about 60 to"
"551020","552180"," 70% of those reports."
"552840","554760"," Come in higher than the expectation."
"557100","562180"," So you've got that going on right as we sell into an earning season Q4 earning season. "
"564860","568200"," And but we have a thorn in this right."
"568900","576260"," We have a thorn right now in this earning season and that is Gaza and Israel."
"576600","586320"," So you've got that thorn right and we talked about today being the day right the 11th until"
"586320","588800"," about the 15th or 18th. "
"589640","591580"," To expect that war to start."
"591840","597760"," And sure enough yesterday in the overnight or last night in the overnight during the day in in"
"597760","599260"," Israel, they started pant flooding."
"600780","605960"," They started dropping pamphlets in Gaza strip. "
"606880","614000"," You know, just like they did in World War II during Dresden during believe it or not, they dropped"
"614000","615080"," pamphlets during Dresden."
"615080","620620"," They dropped pamphlets when they dropped the bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"621000","622840"," I don't know if they did Nagasaki but Hiroshima they did. "
"624800","629420"," And so you've got that specter in the background, right?"
"629840","639620"," And you know that today you should know if you don't know that there was a call for Hamas put"
"639620","641080"," out a call across the world."
"643140","644840"," For Muslims to."
"648380","652300"," To defend Hamas right I guess that's how they put it but basically to. "
"652660","654820"," To create terror today."
"655760","656880"," Across the world."
"657520","661960"," Let's not let's not mix it up but that's what they that's what they did right now does that mean"
"661960","663660"," you're going to experience that today. "
"664060","664600"," No."
"666260","668000"," And Joe made a good point to this morning."
"668120","670900"," It was like he was like, you know, it's not like that you're going to you're going to definitely"
"670900","672380"," see a terrorist attack today. "
"673860","676300"," But when you put something like that out."
"678020","680040"," When you put something like that out."
"680960","687040"," It does call out it does make a call to some crazy people and I don't mean Muslims are crazy. "
"687780","689640"," I mean, just crazy people."
"689980","697640"," Like if you put a if you had a Christians or Democrats or Republicans or our lovers like lovers."
"697640","698920"," I don't care what it is. "
"699200","701180"," If you like a blue balloons."
"702640","707920"," And you then you have a voice across the world and you tell all the blue balloon lovers out there"
"707920","709280"," to do something crazy."
"709980","714320"," There's probably one bat shit crazy blue balloon lover out there. "
"716420","722900"," So I don't think you're going to see like widespread terrorism around the United States, but every"
"722900","725320"," group of people have whack jobs in it."
"725440","733740"," So there is real risk to that today and over the weekend that you could have one dipshit."
"736160","739860"," For lack of a better word, one dipshit out there that. "
"740280","742480"," You know, should probably be in some."
"743140","747600"," In a psychiatric institution of some kind or on some."
"748840","749820"," Prozac and. "
"750140","753880"," This is their moment to shine as a matter of fact earlier this week."
"754780","760940"," You saw a man in New York City jump into the world trade center."
"760940","767220"," A memorial right he jumped down 20 feet and then jumped down another 30 feet. "
"767640","773480"," Now that guy didn't cause any problems, but you know that guy was probably mentally unstable and."
"774640","777360"," Is there a possibility of that happening over the weekend?"
"777840","778860"," Yes, and."
"779960","784680"," Is there a possibility that the news organizations will run with that. "
"784680","789420"," The news organizations I want you to know some news organizations love."
"791340","797620"," To run with that kind of shit and when news organizations run with that kind of shit, guess who"
"797620","798600"," else runs with it."
"799880","800360"," Algorithms. "
"801080","802720"," They'll pick up on that shit."
"803020","809900"," Those algorithms are just begging and looking for some kind of bad news to impact our stock market."
"809900","813620"," So yesterday day before we talked about hedging today. "
"814980","816740"," You guys are asking me, what are you going to hedge?"
"816940","817420"," What are you going to hedge?"
"817460","819960"," I was I was unhedged yesterday the day before."
"820620","825240"," I had a hedge into Wednesday and I told you that today I'd be putting a hedge on."
"827040","832080"," So this morning I put a hedge on on the open and it's still good. "
"832240","833360"," It's it's up right now."
"833480","834020"," It's not up a ton."
"834180","835900"," It's up 25 cents right now. "
"837520","842420"," But that hedges on and let me express this to you clearly okay."
"842780","844240"," We're heading into Friday."
"845440","849800"," Heading into a Friday where you've been given for warning. "
"852240","854540"," That's shouldn't right right now in the world."
"855500","860960"," So I know it can seem like it's recent data suggests the US will achieve a soft landing."
"860960","865140"," That city CEO Fraser commencing in the conference call with analysts. "
"866020","871200"," I know that it can seem like it's in your mind you might be saying to yourself."
"871260","879720"," Well, it's so it's it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so we know so much about it"
"879720","881960"," that we shouldn't have to hedge it right here."
"883760","885140"," It's known to the market. "
"885960","892960"," Remember the market didn't really react to the start of the war because we're sold or sold."
"895320","897640"," And so as you head into a Friday."
"899860","901460"," As you head into a Friday. "
"902900","906820"," It's not really a question of if is something going to happen."
"907460","908540"," It comes down to."
"910080","912720"," It would be fucking prudent for you. "
"913680","919960"," To be hedged over the weekend and not surprisingly Joe this morning said to me."
"920320","921920"," I'm not doing anything today."
"922560","924380"," I was like, are you going to have just like no. "
"925520","928120"," He's like, I was like, you're going to go long and he goes, no."
"929400","932640"," And then he said to me, I'm just going to sit on my hands."
"933820","935040"," Now, Joe's a bull. "
"936280","938140"," But even Joe knows."
"939980","944040"," That it doesn't matter if we go up or if we go down."
"944100","945900"," If there's a terrorist attack. "
"946160","949340"," If there isn't a terrorist attack or forget terrorists."
"949940","951260"," Just a crazy person."
"952240","954400"," That goes out and does some crazy shit. "
"954920","957360"," So his view is, I'll just sit on the sidelines."
"957820","958280"," What do I care?"
"958440","960020"," I don't I just don't need this in my life."
"960660","964240"," And you're likely going to see portions of that today. "
"964940","966540"," You're likely going to see."
"967700","968960"," You're likely going to see."
"970280","971400"," No participation. "
"972780","974060"," In the market today."
"975640","978280"," You're going to see people take Friday off today."
"978880","979540"," They're going to take it off. "
"980720","985220"," Now, meanwhile, while you have that happening, right people just exiting the market."
"985400","986660"," I don't want anything to do with this."
"987860","991260"," You're also going to get a group of people that are going to hedge the weekend. "
"992980","997440"," And then you have to deal with all of the earnings coming out."
"998220","1002480"," So yesterday into the close as I was reviewing those earnings."
"1003620","1006460"," One of the caveats I said to you yesterday was. "
"1008840","1013040"," It's almost like you're going to be you're going to be trading earnings individually."
"1014320","1015880"," Taking the money and running."
"1016700","1021060"," If it's a good report, you're going to see a nice, nice, great trade, right?"
"1021120","1021680"," It's going to be beautiful. "
"1022480","1025160"," We've traded down in earnings, which is positive, right?"
"1026900","1032859"," Because we've traded down into earnings, individual tickers should do outstanding."
"1034339","1036359"," You're like, you've been given the golden goose."
"1037599","1041540"," So you've got, let's say you've got a company, let's just as an example. "
"1041540","1045040"," You've got Tesla trades up into earnings."
"1045960","1049760"," You know there's a high probability that we're going to sell earnings on that ticker, right?"
"1050160","1056880"," If you sold down into earnings on Tesla, they have a really good chance of squeezing or making up a"
"1056880","1058300"," ton of stuff if they have a good earnings."
"1058440","1059540"," This could apply to any company. "
"1059720","1062000"," I'm using Tesla as an example, but it doesn't really matter."
"1063540","1069380"," So you've got like this, you've got this two sided, two faced market right now."
"1070800","1074080"," Well, heading into the weekend and into next week. "
"1075740","1082040"," Now, if nothing happens over the weekend and the market bounces back."
"1082040","1089980"," If everything resolves itself on Monday, all the better, we can start to squeeze higher."
"1089980","1097280"," I don't think that's going to happen, but you're being given, you're being basically being given"
"1097280","1098120"," something, right?"
"1100280","1106320"," You're being told, hey, there's something going on in the Middle East. "
"1106640","1108960"," Now, a lot of you are going to assign this to the 10 year yield."
"1109160","1111800"," I know you guys are like 10 year yields attached to this."
"1112140","1113900"," So I know you guys are trading 10 year yield. "
"1113920","1115720"," You'll be like, oh, it matches up."
"1116320","1121140"," And when the 10 year yield is going up, markets going down."
"1122280","1128160"," If you're to pull an inverted yield curve up, if you're to pull up a 10 out of two and"
"1128160","1136420"," you show it on a chart against SPX over 10, 20 years or something, there is no correlation. "
"1137020","1140540"," Now, you can assign it when there is a correlation causation, right?"
"1141060","1142640"," Hey, it's matching up right now."
"1143480","1148060"," So my own, I know some of you guys out there, it's definitely the yield and not the war in"
"1148060","1150340"," the Middle East, but I assure you that it is."
"1150960","1153140"," I assure you that there is real risk out there. "
"1154040","1162260"," There's a real weaving part of what's going on right now in the Middle East where we could look"
"1162260","1169380"," back on this moment in 20 years and we could look back on this moment in 20 years and it"
"1169380","1176420"," can be really bad, like genocidal or we can look back in 20 years and everything fell in place to"
"1176420","1178900"," the way that they want this to work itself out, right?"
"1180380","1181820"," So we don't have genocide."
"1182140","1186340"," You're able to get out all these people that need to get out from the Gaza Strip."
"1186700","1189680"," You're only fighting militants and you're kind of disbanding Hamas. "
"1191720","1197940"," Try to take these refugees, educate them, give them money and all that other kind of stuff to re "
"1197940","1201080","-educate the young new generation of Palestinians."
"1202360","1204080"," Some of you think that you can't do that."
"1204160","1205300"," I read this last time and read it. "
"1205880","1212900"," People are saying it's impossible to do this and I assure you that it is possible."
"1213280","1214520"," I live in Detroit, Michigan."
"1215300","1218060"," We have a large Muslim population in Detroit. "
"1218800","1223840"," We've got a Chaldeans as well as a Christians, but we've got a lot of Palestinians as well."
"1224860","1226440"," They are doing very well."
"1226580","1230800"," They have a community here in Detroit that is thriving. "
"1232880","1241820"," As a matter of fact, I go to soccer matches, football matches, in a heavily heavy immigrant"
"1241820","1243600"," Muslim community."
"1244220","1250120"," I spend a lot of time in Hamtramic as a place called Hamtramic in Michigan."
"1250120","1254600"," It has a large immigrant population. "
"1255240","1256000"," It's flourishing."
"1256880","1261200"," Now, I don't agree with everything that goes on in Hamtramic, but especially recently, but it"
"1261200","1261720"," doesn't matter."
"1263120","1264480"," It's a flourishing community. "
"1265300","1266760"," So, can they do that?"
"1266920","1267340"," I don't know."
"1267660","1269860"," That doesn't really matter to the stock market either."
"1271280","1275180"," But there is some risk over this weekend as the point that I'm trying to make. "
"1275900","1283120"," If it goes wrong and you drag in the United States and to any kind of extension or expansion of"
"1283120","1285120"," this conflict, it will matter."
"1285380","1286900"," It will matter to our stock market."
"1287300","1290920"," If there's any kind of problems with oil, gas, any of that kind of stuff. "
"1291840","1294460"," Some crazies do some crazy shit in the US."
"1295260","1297080"," That does impact our stock market."
"1297460","1299040"," So, be aware of that. "
"1299360","1299920"," Be aware of it."
"1300040","1308420"," If you weren't trading in 2001, if you weren't trading, previous wars and stuff like that, you'll"
"1308420","1309040"," see an impact."
"1309360","1313060"," So, this action today doesn't surprise me at all. "
"1313460","1314880"," This action doesn't surprise me."
"1315020","1319440"," Now, saying that, we've got a shit ton of calls expiring today."
"1320380","1323620"," A massive amount of calls expiring. "
"1324600","1330000"," And sometimes you'll see as those calls expire, it doesn't matter if there's zero dates."
"1330000","1333880"," It doesn't matter if there were calls that were taken out a month ago."
"1335120","1341700"," That as the day progresses, you could see some squeezing action off of those expiring calls. "
"1342840","1346400"," So, it's possible that you could still see a squeeze today."
"1346860","1347400"," So, it's complicated."
"1348520","1350000"," The market structure is complicated. "
"1350460","1351880"," What's going to happen today is complicated."
"1352860","1353840"," And then you've got no participation."
"1354600","1362740"," So, the only thing that I could recommend to you here would be it's not inadvisable to just sit on"
"1362740","1363460"," your hands today. "
"1364160","1372800"," It may be even sit on your hands into Monday as all of these different cogs and wheels and external"
"1372800","1375160"," factors play out."
"1375920","1381480"," You know, there's a part of this broadcast that we do here."
"1381480","1389340"," This show specifically, I don't stream, like I don't come on stream and make a trade and then get"
"1389340","1390260"," out for the day, right?"
"1391560","1393220"," I'm not known for that, am I?"
"1393500","1395880"," I'm here whether it's a good day, a bad day, or whatever. "
"1396160","1398360"," And I spend a lot of time streaming with you guys."
"1398940","1403460"," You'd be shocked at how many hours of streaming I do versus other people."
"1404120","1406760"," Now, you'll see other streamers will come on for like an hour. "
"1407840","1409120"," Now, come on later in the day."
"1409220","1410280"," It's important for an hour."
"1410560","1412280"," You'll see other streamers that come on for two hours. "
"1413460","1414940"," You'll see recorded videos."
"1416200","1418400"," Oh, there are 15 minutes long out there, right?"
"1418520","1419460"," They're not even live streams."
"1420780","1424860"," So, when I'm not here, you guys freak out. "
"1425580","1426560"," You guys like, where's Cap?"
"1427380","1428280"," Why is he not here today?"
"1428500","1429860"," Why is he not here this morning?"
"1430040","1430600"," Why is he not here?"
"1430900","1432340"," Why is he leaving late in the afternoon?"
"1432340","1439780"," It's because I have conditioned you to expect me to be here five days a week, year round."
"1441320","1448000"," That's not bad, but the point that I'm trying to make is within those streams, people pop into the"
"1448000","1450540"," stream and say, hey, Cap, what are we doing?"
"1450860","1451540"," Are we taking a trade?"
"1451940","1453520"," I'm here for a trade cap, right?"
"1454160","1460140"," And I get asked that question all day long from 9.30 until 4pm every day."
"1460140","1465460"," And so, when you're here with me, we're always thinking about a trade, right?"
"1465820","1466180"," Let's trade. "
"1466560","1468600"," I don't care if it's up, down, sideways, it doesn't matter."
"1469380","1472740"," So, we don't get to discuss a lot, not trading."
"1474360","1475380"," Just not trading. "
"1476940","1483100"," And if I didn't have this show on so frequently, it would be easier for me to express that to"
"1483100","1486280"," you to say, hey, sit on your hands until Monday."
"1486480","1487520"," We'll come back to it on Monday."
"1488660","1489560"," Does that make sense?"
"1490000","1492240"," It says that there's a group of people that come into the stream. "
"1492340","1494080"," Not you guys right now, but just in general."
"1494540","1495620"," Hey, I got off work."
"1495920","1497620"," I know Cap's probably streaming. "
"1498360","1502300"," So, they go down to YouTube or Twitch and I'm either here or I'm not."
"1502520","1503940"," If I'm not here, you're pissed, right?"
"1504740","1505600"," I want Cap there."
"1505720","1506920"," He's there from 9.30 to 4."
"1507200","1508100"," Now, he's not here today. "
"1508180","1508740"," I'm pissed off."
"1509860","1510580"," That's my regular."
"1510840","1512840"," I just stop in, make some trades, then I'm out. "
"1514760","1515980"," Now, that's me."
"1516140","1516720"," I've created that."
"1518020","1523100"," It's hard sometimes to come into a stream and say to people, maybe you just sit on your hands. "
"1524040","1525740"," Maybe you don't do anything today."
"1526500","1528100"," Maybe you don't do anything until Monday."
"1530060","1535860"," And oftentimes, we get wrapped up in the heat of I need to put a trade on. "
"1536060","1537040"," I need to be in the market."
"1537360","1538120"," I need to be this."
"1538460","1539080"," I need to be that. "
"1539980","1541240"," And it's not always like that."
"1541420","1544180"," There are times where you don't have to be in the fucking market."
"1544180","1548000"," There are times where you don't have to be actively trading. "
"1548440","1549360"," And it's OK."
"1550640","1559340"," And oftentimes, when I get complaints or grief from people out there, they'll say, if it's an"
"1559340","1560980"," update, they'll say, he's not here."
"1561580","1565500"," Or if it's an update and I'm not here, they'll say they don't say anything. "
"1566180","1566880"," They'll hear nothing."
"1567600","1571500"," If it's a down day, they'll say, well, he's not here because it's a down day."
"1572000","1574320"," And it's like, but it's not real. "
"1574520","1575040"," It's not true."
"1575160","1578160"," And it's not representative of what I am here."
"1578300","1578720"," Not here. "
"1579460","1583060"," It's more representative of the culture that we've created here."
"1583180","1584460"," Always be trading, right?"
"1584780","1585560"," Always be in the market."
"1585860","1586800"," Always be long or short. "
"1587420","1588340"," Always be theta."
"1588400","1589900"," Whatever it is, doesn't matter."
"1591060","1593620"," And there are times when you don't have to trade. "
"1594580","1596060"," And it's OK to miss a trade."
"1596860","1601520"," And some of the grief that I get says, well, Cap, how can you not stream today?"
"1601680","1604580"," Because we've got this going on."
"1605320","1607140"," We've got war. "
"1607380","1608560"," Today is war, right?"
"1608780","1612700"," Last week, it was end of quarter, end of month, end of quarter."
"1613380","1614740"," The week before that, it's what?"
"1615040","1618840"," We've got FOMC minutes, Cap."
"1619020","1619860"," You've got to be on for that. "
"1620900","1622680"," You've got FOMC meeting, Cap."
"1622860","1623560"," You've got to be on for that."
"1624760","1625480"," Hey, Cap. "
"1625860","1627160"," The VIX is trading 30."
"1627360","1628020"," You've got to be on for that."
"1628140","1628500"," Hey, Cap. "
"1628620","1629440"," The VIX is trading 12."
"1629500","1630340"," You've got to be on for that."
"1630780","1632380"," So there's always a story. "
"1632600","1634160"," I love that story, too."
"1634300","1635060"," Don't get me wrong."
"1635980","1639600"," But just realize that there's always a story. "
"1639920","1641000"," The stock market's famous."
"1641540","1642520"," And I love it for this."
"1643400","1644220"," For a story. "
"1644980","1647160"," It's always famous as a soap opera."
"1648140","1649340"," It's one of the greatest things in the world."
"1649520","1651420"," You've got all these, like, you've got Bill Ackman. "
"1651420","1653640"," You've got Mike Barrie."
"1653920","1655160"," You've got the president."
"1655340","1657500"," No matter who that is, weighing in. "
"1657640","1659160"," You've got the Fed Chair, right?"
"1660040","1664420"," You've got the kings and queens of industry and tech."
"1664980","1668340"," And they step in and stir the shitpot, right?"
"1669480","1671660"," So there's always a burning fire."
"1672560","1676040"," There's always even when things are positive. "
"1678020","1679460"," There's always a story."
"1679460","1681780"," There's always a reason to be in the market."
"1682020","1686700"," And sometimes it's okay for you to not participate. "
"1687780","1688380"," To say, you know what?"
"1688420","1689260"," I'm just going to set my hands."
"1689920","1690700"," Or I'm going to hedge."
"1691160","1698940"," I'm going to trade individual tickers for earning season, not focus on the indexes, and just focus"
"1698940","1700700"," on individual tickers. "
"1701640","1702580"," Does that make sense?"
"1703460","1704900"," I don't know if that makes sense or not."
"1705100","1709160"," That rant this morning, but I get that feeling today on Friday."
"1709160","1716480"," I get that feeling on Friday where today specifically, last night watching Israel saying we're"
"1716480","1721960"," going to start papering the town and we're going to push all these people and then bomb all this"
"1721960","1725940"," shit and then we're going to try to put them in refugee camps and relocate them. "
"1725960","1730120"," And then you've got Hamas pulling their shit, get the babies stuff and all."
"1730200","1733360"," You've got fake fucking news out there on both sides."
"1733380","1735500"," You've got all kinds of nonsense. "
"1735500","1745340"," Yeah, there's a part"
"1745340","1748600"," of this where it's okay not to trade."
"1748860","1755780"," So if you out there, this whole rant is geared towards, this whole rant is really geared towards"
"1755780","1762640"," the trader or investor out there that doesn't feel confident right now."
"1763380","1769560"," So if you're a trader out there and an investor, I don't care if you're a seller, a buyer. "
"1769820","1770220"," I don't care."
"1770520","1777820"," If these are one of those times right now where you're not feeling confidence up or down or it"
"1777820","1781940"," could go against you in a big way, up or down."
"1782440","1784640"," Let's say I got puts on right now. "
"1784700","1789100"," Let's say you're short over the weekend and everything clears up by Monday."
"1789360","1792900"," We start ripping to new highs, right?"
"1794140","1795680"," It's okay not to trade."
"1795680","1798420"," It's okay for you to just say, you know what?"
"1798620","1804260"," I'm going to close my fucking laptop and I'm going to take a long walk this weekend, spend time"
"1804260","1805480"," with my family and friends. "
"1805900","1807520"," I'll come back to it on Monday."
"1808640","1814780"," So if what I'm saying might not or what I'm saying right now might not speak to you, but if"
"1814780","1822380"," there are people watching this stream right now that this is speaking to, it's okay for you not to"
"1822380","1822640"," trade."
"1823720","1831440"," It's okay for you to step away this weekend and just maybe take a sabbatical for a few days. "
"1832140","1835220"," Give yourself three days, four days, come back on Monday."
"1842540","1844100"," You guys understand what I'm saying to you?"
"1845060","1845700"," Let me see."
"1845840","1848380"," I want to find out if you guys even are getting the gist of this. "
"1849620","1853040"," Now there are some people out there that this is great stuff, right?"
"1853300","1858260"," Like to me, I kind of like it, but I know that a lot of you don't because there's a"
"1858260","1859460"," lot of volatility here."
"1859520","1861380"," There's a lot of mines out there."
"1862120","1867220"," There's a lot of dodging weaving that needs to be done in the coming days, more than likely. "
"1867500","1868520"," There's a potential for that."
"1869760","1873100"," Let me know in the chat if you guys are getting the gist of what I'm saying to you."
"1873220","1880100"," Trying to weave this into some kind of a, I'm thinking that there's people out there that they feel"
"1880100","1885780"," the need to be long or short here and they, but they're apprehensive about it. "
"1895760","1896660"," They're right on, right on."
"1896820","1896920"," Okay."
"1897080","1898760"," So you guys at least get the gist of what I'm saying. "
"1899500","1900500"," So don't feel bad."
"1900700","1901920"," Don't feel like you have to get pulled in."
"1902040","1904860"," If you feel like you do get pulled in, if you're a bull bear, I don't care. "
"1904960","1909020"," If you feel like you're getting pulled in, you're getting like clipped on both ends, any of that"
"1909020","1909560"," kind of stuff."
"1909800","1910980"," Just fucking close the laptop."
"1911160","1911800"," Come back on Monday. "
"1913340","1914480"," Don't get on Finn to it."
"1914740","1915460"," Don't get on Reddit."
"1916340","1917120"," Get off Reddit. "
"1917380","1918080"," Get off into it."
"1918280","1919080"," Turn the news off."
"1920660","1921720"," Turn on a movie. "
"1921720","1924660"," Like the sound of music or some shit."
"1925300","1927620"," And just relax over the weekend."
"1928100","1929160"," Take a fucking break. "
"1930140","1933160"," Some of the, some of the people on Reddit last night, it was wild."
"1934640","1939880"," The emotions are running like, like the emotions are all over the place."
"1940400","1943780"," And, you know, I heard people talking about the fog of war. "
"1944060","1945460"," There's not only a fog of war."
"1945640","1949720"," There's a fog of civilians right now too."
"1949720","1960060"," I went back yesterday and I was reading news stories about the Gaza"
"1960060","1965120"," Strip and Israel from a year and two years ago. "
"1965860","1967680"," Not recent stuff."
"1968100","1976000"," Some of it was from the last articles I was reading was from August of this year."
"1977300","1983200"," So what I did was I went back and I started reading some of the biggest news stories about the"
"1983200","1988120"," Middle East, specifically Israel and the Gaza Strip over the past two years. "
"1989700","1994260"," To just get a different perspective pre what's happened."
"1995620","2000620"," And, you know, you can read those articles and then read all the stuff right now."
"2001200","2002560"," And there is a disparity. "
"2003840","2009980"," A massive disparity behind what was being reported then and right now."
"2010220","2014040"," So it's okay for you to just to just turn it all off."
"2014880","2016180"," Just turn it all off. "
"2018460","2019180"," All right."
"2019340","2020080"," You guys are getting this."
"2020320","2020520"," Okay. "
"2021120","2021400"," All right."
"2021560","2023120"," So I'll stop at the rants at this point."
"2023900","2024720"," So let's take a look. "

"2245140","2248560"," Like me baby like a fool for training class."
"2249620","2251960"," I would highly recommend. "
"2252900","2254980"," That you first consider."
"2255620","2261360"," Going to the website I believe it's options industry council.org."
"2261860","2265360"," You can just Google search options industry council."
"2265960","2269820"," And you'll find them now they have an extensive. "
"2271120","2276660"," Library of videos and training programs that I would consider to be one of the best."
"2278760","2279420"," Period."
"2280320","2281420"," The best. "
"2284830","2288840"," Training that you can take for free out there and I don't know how many."
"2289260","2293840"," Unless you're training at a hedge fund or you're training at some kind of a."
"2294780","2299540"," I don't know I think hedge fund be the best the only thing better than that kind of a training"
"2299540","2301540"," is likely a hedge fund."
"2303200","2306740"," Now there might be four rules out there that have their own training classes. "
"2307580","2312800"," For their training systems and you might want to do that on your own or whatever I understand that."
"2314540","2319480"," If you're doing that like a cap don't shit on people's training classes that's fine if people have"
"2319480","2321220"," like a system that they use."
"2321940","2327180"," That specific you're going to catch a bounce here by the way on this weekly trigger. "
"2328200","2333860"," You got a bounce coming heading down to the weekly trigger right now at 431 29 expect a bounce here"
"2333860","2334440"," of some kind."
"2335160","2337020"," Or at least some kind of a pause."
"2339890","2343870"," 35 cents right now 17 to 35 cents baby. "
"2344650","2346590"," I'm wondering if I should take these off and."
"2348570","2351750"," Put them back on again on a potential bounce or not."
"2355650","2357670"," I'm going to leave them on for right now so. "
"2360230","2366930"," Go to the options industry council website watch that video come back and we'll discuss it."
"2367810","2370110"," We'll discuss put back spreads."
"2376660","2381900"," So then come back watch the show but now that options industry council. "
"2383460","2387200"," It's heavy stuff like it's not it's not simplified."
"2387940","2390200"," I think that video I gave you is simplified."
"2390920","2395940"," Some of their I remember your phrase this some of their videos are very simple and straightforward"
"2395940","2396640"," direct. "
"2397120","2399260"," But their lectures are."
"2400160","2400840"," Dense."
"2401760","2405140"," So those lectures when I took the classes that they offered. "
"2406600","2412520"," I would just turn them on the audio and listen to them repetitively."
"2413220","2416400"," And I'd play them while I was driving I'd play them at home."
"2416720","2417960"," I turned them on the background. "
"2418620","2423180"," If I was fucking around I got a I got a I got a big house so like."
"2423420","2428640"," I'll turn them on I got like Alexa and all that shit and I got like Google fucking home and"
"2428640","2429840"," they got speakers everywhere."
"2430520","2434740"," But I'll turn that shit out of my house and just listen to it while I'm doing other shit. "
"2435420","2441280"," So it might be a little too dense for you to be like I'm gonna it can become boring I"
"2441280","2441520"," guess."
"2442040","2445660"," But what you do is you turn that shit on you just listen to him over and over and over"
"2445660","2448800"," and over and over and over and over and over again."
"2449340","2452500"," And over time you start to get the gist of what's going on. "
"2456640","2460500"," I'm not worried about anything I'm in puts right now I got no worries right now."
"2462260","2467480"," I got I got no worries and when we're everywhere around the daily trigger around the weekly trigger"
"2467480","2472540"," it's more this still looks like consolidation to me it doesn't look like I'm not panicking here so."
"2473240","2479780"," I've got no panic going on and I like a daily trigger to weekly trigger across at this point if"
"2479780","2487440"," it happens I'm hedged you should be to if you're along this market you should I've told just non"

"2506640","2507000"," a bull."
"2508060","2514540"," And you're buying this market you own this underlying market you are required right now to have"
"2514540","2520500"," some insurance on this market you have to have insurance to protect your positions."
"2521320","2526140"," So if you can't or don't know how to do that you have likely you likely have no business being"
"2526140","2526720"," in this market. "
"2526720","2532660"," As a matter of fact it's just saying or not what that question that you had right there is probably"
"2532660","2538680"," people out there that don't know how to hedge themselves while being long."
"2539280","2544780"," Don't want to spend the money to hedge themselves the cost of doing business the insurance if you"

"3136740","3139680"," I think it was orange and red or something or green and orange."
"3140500","3145980"," And then like for the holiday season I'll do whites for green and then red for the red candles. "
"3146620","3151960"," So you always pick like white and red orange and some other color orange and brown or something for"
"3151960","3153020"," fall people do that shit."
"3153840","3154540"," That's up to you."

"3316620","3318040"," But it's a quick reference. "
"3319080","3320520"," So what do I keep on mind?"
"3320740","3322040"," I keep a trend line."
"3323180","3324200"," Vertical line."
"3325460","3325520"," Path. "
"3327580","3328300"," Fib retracement."
"3328940","3329880"," Horizontal line."
"3330940","3331280"," Rectangle. "
"3332640","3333060"," Price range."
"3336000","3336340"," Trend based."
"3336340","3337060"," Fib extension. "
"3338180","3339060"," Date range."
"3339860","3340740"," Bar patterns."
"3341500","3342000"," And image. "
"3342520","3343780"," You don't need all these."
"3344060","3345420"," You might like other tools."
"3345820","3346320"," How do you get?"
"3346540","3347460"," How do you create this?"
"3348160","3351780"," If you want to know how do you create this little quick access toolbar. "
"3353240","3356320"," On the left hand side of your screen where you see your tools."
"3357360","3359960"," If you click on one of them over here."
"3360200","3361860"," If you look down here on this side over here. "
"3362860","3368500"," You'll see little as you scroll over the tools on the right hand side of these tools."
"3369160","3371080"," You'll see a little star."
"3371880","3373080"," And you can click favorite. "
"3374520","3377700"," So you're not always searching for tools on the left."
"3377980","3379640"," Just the ones that you like to use a lot."
"3380600","3382320"," You can create your own little toolbar. "
"3382600","3384820"," Your toolbar might not look like my toolbar."
"3385460","3387380"," Your toolbar might be smaller than my toolbar."
"3387740","3389760"," My toolbar might be larger than your toolbar. "
"3389760","3391940"," Your toolbar might be larger than mine."
"3392880","3394540"," And I have a smaller small PP."
"3394860","3396020"," You've got the bigger PP than me. "
"3396220","3398240"," This just happens to be what I use over here."
"3400780","3403220"," Now if you're like cap you're going too fast."
"3403700","3404480"," Rewind the video. "
"3404980","3407040"," Or come back to it on Saturday or Sunday."
"3407640","3408920"," And you can look at that stuff."
"3410520","3413180"," Now the market in general here. "
"3413400","3414680"," Let's look at spy here."
"3416340","3418060"," We have this bottoming pattern."
"3418220","3419760"," We have consolidation down here. "
"3419760","3422820"," You got the dragon kind of a pattern here."
"3422940","3425440"," The expectation is that we're going to bounce and go up right."
"3425860","3427580"," Close all this crap here. "
"3428820","3430460"," S&P 500 right."
"3431280","3433420"," Now price is down here right now right."
"3434720","3437960"," It's testing trying to try to break underneath the weekly. "
"3438660","3441840"," And start to blast down and trade this monthly trigger."
"3444060","3444600"," Right."
"3444740","3446540"," Trying to trade that monthly trigger down there. "
"3446840","3448560"," So we know a couple of things already."
"3448560","3450520"," Pretty simple stuff here right."
"3451120","3453440"," We know that if we lose the weekly trigger. "
"3454340","3457100"," That we're likely going to the downside right."
"3458480","3461700"," We're likely going to trade down here."
"3461980","3464060"," So if we break through this weekly trigger. "
"3464700","3468540"," We're likely going to we're likely going to trade down and retest this prior low."
"3469400","3471600"," And more than likely go even lower."
"3472680","3474380"," And that target to the downside. "
"3475260","3478080"," On spy is 41035."
"3478640","3478960"," Okay."
"3479100","3480080"," So 41035. "
"3482640","3484520"," The next thing that you want to know."
"3485420","3489680"," Is that if if we're bullish or bearish."
"3490500","3492260"," On the marketplace. "
"3493480","3501800"," I'm always looking for price hourly trigger daily trigger weekly trigger monthly trigger."
"3502620","3505580"," But within all of these triggers."
"3506620","3509960"," There's some important things to know about each one of these triggers. "
"3510840","3512880"," The first one is this blue line."
"3512900","3515940"," This light blue line as long as price is above it."
"3516420","3518160"," The market is generally bullish. "
"3519100","3520800"," So as long as we do not break."
"3521840","3526520"," This is any ticker to as long as price remains above the light blue."
"3527660","3528160"," Monthly trigger. "
"3529060","3530960"," The trend is still up."
"3535460","3539480"," If the orange trigger is your weekly trigger."
"3539860","3541860"," This one is the emotional trigger. "
"3542960","3544640"," This is the volatility trigger."
"3545600","3547760"," High emotions run high."
"3548620","3551260"," When price is near the orange trigger. "
"3552360","3556580"," So mark my words on this one when price gets close to this orange trigger."
"3557300","3558460"," Shit gets wild."
"3559320","3561400"," You will see volatile price. "
"3561400","3565180"," I'm going to show you an example of that right now."
"3566060","3568380"," You see this volatility right here right."
"3568880","3571760"," Price around this orange line right here right. "
"3572300","3574180"," You see the volatility in price."
"3574720","3582740"," That's because prices are in and around the orange line."
"3583600","3586740"," So whenever the price is whenever price is not here. "
"3587540","3588740"," Not up here."
"3589220","3592500"," Whenever price is around here it gets really wild."
"3593180","3594260"," Eraticness right. "
"3594760","3598100"," Emotions run high around the orange line."
"3599800","3604480"," The next thing that you want to consider is the yellow line."
"3604620","3606320"," This is the daily trigger right. "
"3607440","3608520"," Daily trigger."
"3610560","3612140"," This is major trend."
"3613060","3616160"," This is like a major trend for the stock market but. "
"3616740","3620040"," One of the best parts about the yellow line the daily trigger."
"3621550","3626300"," Is you can use it as a springboard up and down."
"3626620","3630000"," If price is above the daily trigger. "
"3630920","3634720"," You can usually unless you unless price breaks below."
"3635340","3641680"," Use it as a major springboard for big time moves over weeks and possibly even months."
"3642420","3644300"," Come down your bouncing off it right. "
"3644760","3648420"," You're using this as a springboard to go long."
"3649720","3653440"," What else can we tell from this this yellow line right here."
"3654440","3657640"," Is that if price breaks below the yellow line. "
"3658100","3662500"," You're going to use it as a springboard not just breaks but breaks and rejects."
"3663200","3665300"," So you see we didn't break below this right."
"3665640","3668260"," If you break below it it means we break and then reject. "
"3669480","3674660"," If we begin to reject off that yellow line you can use it as a springboard in the reverse."
"3676500","3680060"," So if you're above it you can use it as a springboard to the upside."
"3680120","3683560"," If you're below it you can use it as a springboard to the downside. "
"3685240","3689080"," A prime example of that would be price is rejected right here."
"3690020","3691840"," And we use it as a springboard to the downside."
"3692800","3693640"," Price comes back. "
"3694080","3695540"," Use it as a springboard to the downside."
"3696180","3698760"," Price comes back up here and what happens."
"3699420","3703020"," Does it reject nope it slips right back up again right. "
"3703420","3708740"," Come back down starts to confirm the move up and it's a springboard boom to the upside right."
"3709620","3713360"," We come back down here we put a call spread call on the super call spread on."
"3713960","3719280"," We have stops below if we break through our stops right we start to reject. "
"3719980","3723940"," Come underneath and now it's a springboard to the downside okay."
"3725540","3730560"," So that yellow line is a good tool as a springboard."
"3734560","3738960"," The green line is an intermediary springboard. "
"3739920","3741940"," Watch this green line right here right."
"3742460","3745360"," Whenever we're above this green line we're bullish right."
"3745560","3746600"," Intraday bullishness. "
"3747380","3749220"," We're above the green line right."
"3750280","3752980"," Intraday bullishness right."
"3754220","3756740"," If we are below the green line. "
"3757880","3765310"," We're using it intraday as a springboard to the downside right downside right."
"3766060","3769960"," So right now let's look at the market where is the market right now."
"3771860","3775880"," Price got underneath the hourly trigger. "
"3776860","3780560"," And price got underneath the daily trigger."
"3780560","3785180"," So what are we using this as a springboard to the downside right."
"3786640","3787800"," Springboard to the downside. "
"3789240","3793620"," So what are we look if you're a bull let's so we're in with the inverse right now right."
"3793840","3795420"," This works for bulls and bears."
"3796280","3801400"," If this was inverse right now they would it would apply this it would just apply in the inverse. "
"3802060","3804500"," So let's say right now you're looking for."
"3805560","3807240"," There's a one minute chart right."
"3809930","3813770"," You've got price below the green and the yellow that means we're going down right. "
"3815190","3817060"," Now if you want to reverse."
"3818310","3821750"," And get bullish again what are you looking for."
"3822070","3826350"," The first thing that you're looking for is price and a smaller time frame. "
"3827250","3830950"," Your first hint at a reversal up or down doesn't matter."
"3831390","3837510"," Is going to be price above or below across of the red and white the one in five minutes."
"3837510","3843610"," A smaller time frame so if you see the red turn around and the white turn around. "
"3845270","3850170"," And price begins oh yeah baby we're going right down right now squeezing baby I'm still long puts"
"3850170","3850670"," by the way."
"3851030","3853550"," If you see price come back up and go up here."
"3854030","3856150"," It's your first indication of a reversal. "
"3856870","3861310"," Same thing in the inverse you see price break below the white in the red line."
"3861850","3864370"," It's your first alert that."
"3864370","3866250"," Hold on I'm going to take some money here. "
"3866390","3871170"," Do they still not fucking pay me 36 fucking cents for that right there fuck you dealers."
"3872590","3876830"," So this would be a reversal a reversal indicator right."
"3877350","3880890"," And then just like that green line on a higher time frame that hourly. "
"3881370","3883450"," If price begins to break above that."
"3883910","3888870"," That's telling you that we're likely going to go up for us for one to three days five days"
"3888870","3889710"," something like that."
"3889710","3891790"," The same thing applies to the downside. "
"3891790","3894830"," So today what are we right now."
"3895750","3901310"," Today we're today we're bearish right you broke below the green in the yellow and we got a hint of"
"3901310","3902910"," that earlier didn't we look at it."
"3902930","3905990"," We got a hint of that before it even happened. "
"3907070","3913570"," That white and yellow line cross right there is telling you to be bearish."
"3913950","3919770"," This positioning chart switched to bearish right here at this moment at 10 30."
"3920550","3924750"," We squeeze up for liquidity and boom right down to the depths of hell right. "
"3925370","3927390"," Same thing in the inverse for bulls."
"3934900","3936540"," They take the money here now."
"3937320","3939520"," We're only at 37 fucking cents. "
"3939700","3941060"," I want more goddamn money."
"3941600","3942600"," It's not enough."
"3943320","3944580"," Fuck your puts man. "
"3945280","3945780"," Sorry."
"3946460","3947580"," I need like."
"3948360","3950280"," Maybe I should have just done fucking puts friends. "
"3950660","3952460"," That's why I go back to zero dates."
"3952460","3958160"," Because I'm like like man fucking weekly suck."
"3958780","3960440"," They don't pay shit. "
"3965580","3968180"," They don't pay shit."
"3970140","3973000"," So we're bearish right now right."
"3973180","3973700"," Does that make sense. "
"3974660","3977740"," And notice how I drop time frames here."
"3977740","3980900"," So you've got you've got leading indicators."
"3981100","3986200"," You've got leading edge of the one in five minute to tell you there's going to be reversal. "
"3987020","3989020"," You've got the hourly trigger."
"3989760","3994320"," That tells you if we're above or below it that that that they were going up or down."
"3995700","3999060"," They also act as support and resistance as well right. "
"3999300","4001100"," The weeklies the dailies the Arles."
"4003080","4007360"," Or at least as sign posts or or pause posts."
"4007780","4008740"," So even right now. "
"4009460","4011640"," Can we break through this weekly trigger?"
"4011940","4012300"," Yes."
"4013300","4014500"," But what is it?"
"4015200","4016680"," It's a signpost right."
"4016920","4018580"," We're trading down into it right now. "
"4019520","4022740"," And you're going to you're going to see some natural resistance here."
"4022860","4023160"," Not always."
"4023480","4024640"," Sometimes you blast right through. "
"4025140","4028880"," But generally speaking 70 90% of the time."
"4028880","4035200"," This is going to be one of these things is going to be a signpost for you."
"4035520","4039260"," The weeklies the monthlies the dailies the one minutes the five minutes. "
"4041620","4043460"," You see him probing it right now."
"4043700","4045600"," Watch him probe this weekly trigger right now."
"4048340","4050720"," Jesus Christ are all of you guys short right now. "
"4051340","4055940"," I feel like I swear I feel like I swear I swear I feel like."
"4055940","4063080"," I feel like whenever I'm not streaming or I'm like I'm inputs the whole fucking market just sells."
"4065830","4068010"," Coming down to S one right now. "
"4068370","4069790"," Let's look at the weebold chart really quick."
"4070950","4073010"," Coming down into S one."

"4081770","4084970"," Remember that by the dip thing I told you about it's over here. "
"4085690","4088350"," Today and today's pivot is at S two."
"4088970","4090830"," This is the this is what I said to you."
"4090930","4093890"," I either want to be buying a dip above or I want to buy a dip down here. "
"4093910","4094850"," This is the first place."
"4095010","4097470"," The normal business is usual with the most."
"4100479","4104740"," And then you've got the by the fucking dip down here. "
"4105460","4107979"," I'm going to bet that this is S three."
"4108140","4111160"," I'm going to bet that this is STX by down here."
"4112460","4114740"," Or RTX by keeps saying STX. "
"4114899","4116200"," But it's RT I think it's RTX by."
"4117880","4120760"," I'm going to bet that's an RTX by right down there."
"4122279","4125060"," And that's four twenty two four twenty. "
"4126700","4128460"," Fifty nine and stuff like that."
"4128779","4130120"," Did I say that was for ten early?"
"4130300","4130979"," It's four thirty one."
"4132500","4133859"," That weekly trigger. "
"4134040","4135300"," I think it might have said four ten but."
"4138520","4142399"," So watch this action right now in this weekly trigger watch this action."
"4143680","4144680"," Thirty eight. "
"4144840","4146560"," I'm going to take the money on this one."
"4150220","4153880"," Thank you very fucking much for the free fucking thousand dollars."
"4156979","4158060"," Just made a grand. "
"4161399","4162340"," Okay, so."
"4163680","4165479"," No, I'm flat right now."
"4166859","4171420"," So we're going to look at this one minute chart right now and what do I want to see for"
"4171420","4172760"," further downside blood. "
"4173319","4175260"," You guys want to know what I want to see here."
"4175920","4177520"," You're going to show you what I want to see."
"4179560","4181439"," I want to see blood right here. "
"4183080","4187819"," And there's more book map says there's more down to go right you see the see that little bit of"
"4187819","4188620"," supply down there."
"4189520","4194200"," I want to see like break that red line on I want to break that red line on book map."
"4194720","4196140"," And then I want to reject it. "
"4196480","4199640"," I want to see like boom boom boom boom boom and start seeing blood."
"4199640","4205820"," And I'm going to set up another put program right here right so I'm going to lean into some more"
"4205820","4206340"," puts here."
"4206420","4209720"," I'm not going to buy him right now, but I'm going to set him up. "
"4211000","4217260"," So if we begin to reject in only if we begin to go down will I pick those puts up"
"4217260","4219820"," and let's talk about that for a minute."
"4220580","4226160"," What would really help me to have conviction of more downside to come."
"4227480","4229460"," Would be a little bit of help right. "
"4230220","4233860"," Like this white line crossing would help me to go down more."
"4234880","4237920"," This red line would help me to go down more."
"4239560","4243700"," But not not as good as that as that green line right. "
"4244580","4247640"," You guys are right you guys hear me talk about this stuff for bulls right."
"4248440","4254000"," I'm like yeah the white line that red lights a one minute trigger five minute trigger can't really"
"4254000","4255320"," break the weekly trigger."
"4256760","4258780"," The WT probably not. "
"4259160","4262260"," We're not having to mark crash on a one minute trigger and a five minute trigger."
"4262940","4263980"," How do you get a one minute."
"4264340","4266340"," How do you get a crash below the weekly trigger. "
"4267820","4269740"," You need the fucking daily trigger."
"4269900","4271540"," You need the hourly trigger."
"4271760","4275720"," You need all these you need all these bad boys up here these bad girls right here. "
"4276040","4279960"," These bad bitches right up here to help with the cross down below."
"4280880","4284480"," You need that daily trigger to smash through that weekly trigger."
"4284480","4289300"," You need that hourly trigger to give you momentum to the downside. "
"4290460","4292880"," This weekly trigger is not to be fucked with."
"4293140","4298080"," I warn you don't fuck with this stuff like these are like a weekly trigger a monthly trigger."
"4298260","4304840"," These are some strong ass momentum in the market that builds up over long periods of time. "
"4305400","4308460"," They are major signposts in our marketplace."
"4309200","4313980"," If you see us break those things it's bad it's bad."
"4314480","4320220"," It's usually like real money selling by major institutions and they're pulling the fucking plug. "
"4320600","4328680"," Or it's major momentum coming down on top of raining down on top forcing the market lower."
"4329060","4337920"," So right now initially I'm going to expect this to hold unless I start seeing half hour bar"
"4337920","4341840"," red half hour bar failure."
"4342820","4348880"," Like a failure right no will from bulls bulls with no will weak ass bulls. "
"4349500","4353060"," Like if this green bar goes up here that's not a weak bull is it."
"4354200","4357240"," But if the bulls fail to buy this right."
"4358360","4366220"," And then we get another half hour bar down here right break below this one right blast through"
"4366220","4366740"," here. "
"4366740","4374040"," You get one last death row from a bull he comes back up here and they give him one last"
"4374040","4374820"," out right here."
"4374940","4377660"," And then all of a sudden it's it's we're raining or raining men right."
"4378360","4383440"," It's raining men hallelujah and you're slamming the cell button right there. "
"4386020","4391460"," So watch this bounce right now right now this could reject the downside if you're a bear you're"
"4391460","4393140"," probably looking for a rejection right here."
"4393140","4398160"," Me personally I'm going to be looking for some kind of consolidation here."
"4399400","4403880"," You're going to need some time to get that hourly trigger down here to roll us down a little bit. "
"4406360","4410840"," There is a bounce for you right there on the weekly trigger we'll see if this holds."
"4411920","4415680"," I'm also paying attention to no bounce if there's no bounce here."
"4416380","4422220"," If we don't get a squeeze higher we just start trading this weekly trigger that's a warning to me. "
"4423140","4425780"," It's telling me to hold up their bull."
"4426600","4431540"," We're going to bring down the hourly trigger and the daily trigger and fuck your face up just hold"
"4431540","4432060"," on bull."
"4432980","4437620"," So I want to see if we're squeezing I want to see if we're just parked on the weekly trigger"
"4437620","4440120"," all those kind of things matter. "
"4446810","4449010"," I'm so fucking glad I took that money."
"4451490","4454110"," I'm so fucking glad I took that money."
"4457030","4459550"," That was a nice fucking trade Joe donut. "
"4460070","4464330"," If you're out there right now hopefully you took that trade with me and made a bunch of cash too."
"4465250","4469270"," So if you're out there Joe I don't know if you're listening right now but if you are hopefully you"
"4469270","4471710"," took that goddamn trade with me and made some cash just then."
"4473730","4475290"," That was a good fucking trade. "
"4479580","4483480"," Okay so we went through most of this simple stuff is all pretty simple stuff right."
"4484620","4486360"," Let's talk about the next thing here."
"4486480","4488040"," Let's look at velocity. "
"4489860","4491660"," Let's go back to the trigger screen."
"4492640","4494140"," We're going to go to a 30 minute chart."
"4497840","4500220"," Let's take a look at the velocity. "
"4501720","4507820"," I like to use velocity in a one minute time frame a 30 minute time frame and a daily time"
"4507820","4508160"," frame."
"4508560","4514000"," You might like using velocity and the triggers on a different time frame five minutes 15 minutes."
"4514000","4520480"," I want you to know if you have this if you do have this tool that you do have a."
"4521900","4524660"," You do have I want to show you guys something here something cool. "
"4526780","4529140"," So I want you to know on."
"4529480","4530540"," Let me show this to you here."
"4533720","4535160"," There's an auto in this one. "
"4535240","4536080"," Oh yeah right here."
"4537160","4539780"," So this button right here will give you auto triggers."
"4540880","4547160"," Or non auto triggers and the big one for this is the big one for this is going to be"
"4547160","4548100"," your velocity suite. "
"4550000","4552280"," So I want you to see this one right here."
"4552360","4555020"," This is the key one on your velocity suite right here."
"4555460","4556520"," If you have the suite. "
"4557860","4563080"," You can preset day trader swing trader macro trader if you're on day trader."
"4563560","4567980"," It's on the one minute chart if you're on the swing trader you're in the 30 minute chart."
"4567980","4570280"," Macro trader daily chart. "
"4571160","4576820"," The show trader is auto set to auto but you can always change these."
"4577040","4583480"," If you want to use like the swing the 30 minute velocities on all your charts that's fine."
"4584160","4588700"," I don't think so we want to switch this to 30 minute velocity right. "
"4589800","4594260"," Even though I'm trading on a one minute chart so I'm going to change this to swing."
"4595040","4599820"," And because I like the 30 minute velocity it's the most consistent for me."
"4600440","4605580"," So I'm going to switch to a one minute chart with 30 minute velocity okay. "
"4606380","4607160"," For spy."
"4608480","4612700"," And I'm looking at velocity now and what am I looking for here."
"4614240","4618260"," Let's look at this is 30 minute velocity here and what am I looking for here. "
"4618520","4619220"," I'm looking for."
"4621420","4623000"," A bottoming right."
"4623000","4624680"," So this is a one minute chart right here. "
"4625480","4628960"," I want you to see these lows down here in this green bar."
"4629580","4631460"," I want you to pay attention to this right here."
"4632780","4638220"," And how we have higher lows on half hour of velocity or becoming bullish in here okay. "
"4638800","4642380"," So we're starting to become bullish up in here and what's price starting to go up up here."
"4643060","4648280"," So let's look at 30 minute velocity right now in a one minute chart on spoons."
"4648280","4655960"," And we're not quite there are we half hour looks good but the hourly does not look good does it. "
"4656360","4658720"," Looks like we've got some work to do."
"4660780","4661680"," Hold on here."
"4664310","4664890"," Clear. "
"4666630","4667990"," Change this to white."
"4668890","4674090"," Looks like velocity is still not bottoming yet as it has a little bit more rounding to do."
"4676450","4679370"," Right and I'm going to take a look at a different velocity as well. "
"4679390","4682050"," I'm going to now change the daily of the velocity suite."
"4683110","4688090"," Even though I'm on a one minute chart I'm going to switch it from swing to day trader or excuse"
"4688090","4689290"," me macro trader."
"4690230","4691110"," Click OK. "
"4692470","4694250"," Watch now it's not going to do it for me."
"4696310","4698130"," Now it's not going to bring it up for me."
"4699130","4699950"," Hold on here. "
"4705500","4707840"," And sure enough it's sure enough now it's not working."
"4708600","4709760"," Let me reload my page here."
"4712980","4714360"," I don't know why that's not working. "
"4714540","4714780"," Okay."
"4715020","4715960"," I don't know why it's not working."
"4715960","4717000"," I'm going to have to work on that then. "
"4717060","4717940"," I guess I got to do an update."
"4718980","4720500"," It's back on auto again."
"4720900","4724400"," I'm going to check even though I'm looking for that rounding on the 30 minutes. "
"4726280","4728440"," Even though I'm looking for this rounding on the 30 minute."
"4728620","4730580"," There's my daily velocity."
"4730980","4731980"," Let's look at daily velocity. "
"4734180","4735500"," So daily velocity."
"4737060","4739940"," When the 30 minute chart is showing me this right here, right?"
"4740120","4741240"," This is kind of bullish here."
"4742060","4743940"," We had our major low down here. "
"4744220","4746780"," This is telling me that we're likely going to go up here."
"4747480","4748420"," So are we going to crash?"
"4748980","4749880"," Probably not."
"4751180","4755080"," The daily velocity is telling me now you're probably not going to crash here. "
"4756120","4758300"," So I checked my daily velocity."
"4758400","4759500"," I checked my hourly velocity."
"4759880","4760340"," That's PNC. "
"4760800","4762000"," Fucking am in the wrong goddamn chart."
"4762520","4763400"," Damn PNC."
"4767700","4769960"," My daily velocity is coming up. "
"4770140","4771100"," Do you see this daily vlog?"
"4771260","4771800"," I already know this."
"4772000","4774420"," I'm telling you guys like I'm really good friend up for the first time."
"4775120","4775640"," But watch this. "
"4775860","4776780"," Watch this daily fellow."
"4777040","4779700"," We're having higher lows on velocity and daily."
"4780280","4784380"," So that's kind of telling me to expect us to bottom down here. "
"4784940","4785820"," To not crash."
"4786320","4788180"," We probably have more more down to go."
"4789320","4792340"," But not crash down to go. "
"4794000","4795880"," So everything looks good here."
"4796800","4798360"," Everything actually looks kind of good."
"4798520","4800940"," If I'm on a one minute, go back to a one minute chart. "
"4805720","4807660"," I'm likely going to expect."
"4811890","4812410"," Possibly."
"4813190","4815090"," Let me go one quick second here. "
"4816510","4818190"," I'm going to walk in this here."
"4827590","4831570"," I'm going to possibly expect some more down here."
"4831570","4835430"," But not a break of this of this previous low. "
"4835710","4840130"," I'm going to expect this previous low to hold based upon daily velocity."
"4840730","4845830"," Am I expecting like bloodbath down here and then bloodbath down there?"
"4846230","4846510"," No."
"4846850","4849490"," As of right now, I'm not expecting that. "
"4850270","4850990"," So whoa."
"4851610","4854730"," So worse case scenario for a bull here."
"4855370","4860390"," Probably a retest of the prior lows down here. "
"4860390","4861230"," So that's 420."
"4862130","4866890"," And that's right where you know that I have my lower dip buy, right?"
"4866990","4868870"," So we got this 420 down here, right?"
"4869130","4870150"," Worst case scenario."
"4871430","4872810"," That's my expectation. "
"4873810","4878410"," So if we go over to the weebull chart, where's my buy the fucking dip?"
"4878650","4879390"," It's right down here."
"4880490","4885150"," It's right where my expectation where what daily velocity is telling me."
"4885490","4887530"," That should be the worst that I expect. "
"4888430","4891610"," And we likely can even buy this one down here."
"4892350","4893950"," This buy the dip."
"4895150","4901630"," So BTD over here likely a good chance in this BTFD likely a good chance of being able to buy"
"4901630","4901790"," it. "
"4901850","4903070"," And what's happening right now?"
"4903270","4907510"," Let's look at spy really quick."
"4907710","4908270"," We're getting a bounce."
"4909130","4909590"," Soccer. "
"4910750","4912470"," We're getting a fucking bounce."
"4914590","4916350"," Shocker, shocker, shocker."
"4916350","4917730"," What else do we have happened yesterday?"
"4920210","4926720"," On the trigger screen on spy, what happened yesterday?"
"4929950","4935130"," We got a near perfect bounce right off. "
"4935630","4936030"," Bam, bam."
"4936370","4936910"," Bam, bam."
"4937030","4937790"," Squeeze it up, right?"
"4938550","4939470"," Near perfect bounce. "
"4939830","4940810"," What are you seeing right now?"
"4941110","4941550"," Another bounce."
"4941850","4942530"," Will this bounce hold?"
"4942810","4943170"," I don't know."
"4943750","4944570"," But we are bouncing. "
"4944970","4945890"," What is this telling you?"
"4946230","4947450"," This is an important level, right?"
"4947450","4950430"," It's an important level for the market here."
"4953120","4954840"," So watch that bounce right now."
"4956000","4957680"," And what does this look like so far?"
"4957940","4958520"," Consolidation. "
"4959020","4960780"," It's not distribution yet."
"4961020","4961920"," How do you get distribution?"
"4963340","4965100"," You break this right here."
"4965220","4966800"," You get distribution, don't you?"
"4967500","4976680"," So if you're a bear, you need to break 421-29 for this consolidation to turn into distribution. "
"4978060","4982220"," So key level here for the market on spy specifically."
"4983260","4985360"," This is a key level right here."
"4986220","4988040"," And we're now above the one minute trigger. "
"4988820","4990880"," Let's see if we can squeeze this up right now."
"4991100","5000860"," Backtest this and squeeze this up and trade 432.89. So what am I taking away from the velocity"
"5000860","5002460"," right now is consolidation."
"5003660","5004780"," That's what I'm taking away from it. "
"5006300","5008500"," Not extreme bearishness of any kind."
"5008940","5011920"," I'd need to see us break below this weekly trigger."
"5012560","5018940"," And I don't even need to see us break below the monthly trigger down here at 41035. "
"5026310","5027850"," Take a quick break here for a minute."
"5027910","5029910"," I want to read through the chat and see what you guys are saying."
"5048380","5058120"," Can I explain my, can I explain my posts earlier today of what you guys are saying here?"
"5060140","5062620"," Can you explain whatever your Twitter posts say?"
"5062800","5066780"," What effect does positive game expiring have on the marketplace?"
"5068120","5077280"," I'm always looking for, I'm always looking for large expiries of gamma on"
"5077280","5078700"," specific dates. "
"5078700","5082700"," And they usually come in on end of month and end of quarter."
"5083520","5088720"," But fascinatingly enough, we've got a bunch of calls expiring today, don't we?"
"5089480","5095560"," And so we want to know like the dealers want those calls to expire worthless."
"5096480","5103520"," So if you've got puts, right, they want those to expire worthless or not what you paid for them. "
"5103520","5104260"," Does that make sense?"
"5105660","5114800"," And as they begin to expire, sometimes we can see those calls actually print or puts doesn't matter"
"5114800","5116880"," as we come into that expiry."
"5116880","5119620"," Sometimes you'll see it at the end of the day too."
"5119780","5121180"," You won't see it until like 345. "
"5122560","5125220"," So sometimes like four in the afternoon, twelve in the afternoon."
"5125520","5131060"," So I found it fascinating that we have a bunch of calls coming off the market today."
"5131700","5137660"," We're left with a bunch of puts into the end of month, right?"
"5138200","5145820"," So the end of month, I think the date was the 17th for all those puts that we have that"
"5145820","5146760"," will be left on the market. "
"5146760","5149680"," So that makes me think that we don't crash and print that shit."
"5150700","5154440"," And then we could we could possibly squeeze into the end of the day today."
"5155020","5160080"," There's a potential for it as you head in a four p.m. Or that they just burn all those"
"5160080","5163100"," calls into four p.m. and then we rip into Monday. "
"5164080","5166540"," So that's my thesis on that."
"5167260","5168680"," On that expiring gamma."
"5183040","5185000"," You read through some of your comments here. "
"5199360","5200260"," High big balls."
"5206040","5207120"," Oh, here we go."
"5207360","5207960"," What else we got here?"
"5208080","5209240"," Let me see what you guys are saying on YouTube. "
"5211500","5212660"," Thanks for subscribing, Dave."
"5212760","5213360"," I appreciate it."
"5213360","5221330"," I made a I put for a nine hundred bucks. "
"5221430","5222530"," I made nineteen hundred."
"5222870","5223770"," Do I know what I made?"
"5224130","5224550"," That's what I made."
"5240290","5246250"," Make a note here that NASDAQ is trading fifteen thousand. "
"5247630","5252810"," So NASDAQ matching up almost perfectly with the weekly trigger here."
"5255010","5257350"," Fifteen thousand on NDX right now."
"5262110","5263470"," Hey Perry, how are you?"
"5263650","5264250"," Happy Friday. "
"5265470","5266110"," Good to see you brother."
"5267130","5268150"," How have you been, man?"
"5273360","5276220"," Let's take a walk around the market and check some tickers."
"5276460","5276840"," Hold on here. "
"5276960","5280480"," Let's go around the market and just just blast through and look at some stuff here."
"5282340","5285920"," Let's look at let's look at copper futures."
"5286860","5292040"," Let's go to the trigger screen here. "
"5292160","5294420"," Let's go to a 30 minute chart on copper."
"5297220","5298500"," Huh, interesting."
"5300600","5302320"," So we're on copper right now. "
"5302580","5304620"," 30 minute chart on copper."
"5306680","5308720"," We're in Beartown, aren't we?"
"5309420","5311020"," On copper here, right?"
"5311160","5312500"," It's a 30 minute chart on copper."
"5313700","5320200"," We are bottoming on copper and at least in velocity, but we haven't rounded the corner yet, have"
"5320200","5320420"," we?"
"5322000","5325400"," We don't want to see a rejection on copper, do we?"
"5326140","5329840"," But this is known support, so this is positive for bulls. "
"5330620","5334640"," So I want you to know that this is known buyers down here on copper."
"5335140","5338100"," So copper, copper, we don't want to lose this, do we?"
"5338520","5340720"," We don't want to reject here, do we?"
"5341380","5348850"," And we want to monitor, we want to monitor copper, right?"
"5349030","5352670"," So if you have access to the tool, what can you do here?"
"5353590","5356270"," You guys want to know what you can do, you want to know something cool you can do?"
"5357070","5358730"," So here's the daily trigger, right?"
"5359590","5365430"," You can right click on this daily trigger and you can set an alert."
"5367230","5372290"," So you can actually set an alert on your daily trigger, right?"
"5373170","5377290"," If it crosses the monthly trigger, it's pretty fucking bad. "
"5378530","5384150"," So if at home, if you have access to the tool, you might want to set an alert at home"
"5384150","5393530"," on the trigger, that if it crosses the monthly trigger, right here, the blue one, to get the fuck"
"5393530","5394470"," out of the way, right?"
"5395490","5405980"," So if you end up seeing Dr. Copper recover, reject"
"5405980","5413140"," something like that to the downside, and you actually get that cross of the yellow and blue line,"
"5413140","5416220"," you're going to expect a fucking bloodbath in copper."
"5417940","5420840"," So you might want to set two alerts."
"5421440","5425180"," You can set an alert on Dr. 3 alerts. "
"5425340","5429820"," You can set an alert on Dr. Copper, daily trigger crossing monthly trigger."
"5430520","5437500"," You can set a second alert on Dr. Copper of price higher than hourly trigger."
"5437500","5445920"," And you could set a third alert of hourly trigger crossing above the daily trigger. "
"5446440","5452000"," And that would give you, that would give you, if you see the hourly trigger crossing above the"
"5452000","5455720"," daily trigger, that's an all clear sign for you, right?"
"5455920","5462480"," If you're a bull, it's also a sign that if you're short to get the fuck out of being short"
"5462480","5463160"," attack, right?"
"5464120","5469700"," So right now, Dr. Copper, not so bad, sitting on its previous prior support."
"5470600","5473080"," All these fucking bears want to sell this shit, don't they?"
"5474500","5481860"," Known buyers here, known buyers here, known buyers here, known buyers here, but we don't want to"
"5481860","5483100"," see that break, do we?"
"5483260","5487020"," We don't want to see that daily trigger on copper break below."
"5487360","5492360"," So if you're at home and you have access to the tool, make yourself a little alert. "
"5493020","5496480"," For copper crossing the daily trigger crossing the monthly trigger."
"5496760","5501740"," If that does happen, you're going to see tech go just like this."
"5502260","5504800"," The depths of hell. "
"5508560","5509900"," I don't think that happens."
"5510140","5514200"," You're going to need an event over the weekend, by the way, for that to happen, if you want to"
"5514200","5514360"," know."
"5519160","5521020"," Let's look back on spoos. "
"5524090","5525470"," So we started with copper."
"5526890","5529070"," We're going to move over and look at a bunch of other crap."
"5529290","5529950"," We're going to look at. "
"5531510","5532770"," We're going to look at H, Y, G."
"5534270","5536630"," We're going to look at T and X."
"5536970","5539430"," We're going to look at T and A, baby."
"5540390","5540970"," T and X."
"5541930","5542950"," Really a T and A."
"5543990","5546750"," I guess if I was a woman, what I say, I wouldn't say T and A, would I?"
"5547950","5549070"," I would say T and D."
"5549270","5551350"," No, I guess, I guess men have tits too, don't they?"
"5553810","5555710"," I would be the world's worst woman."
"5555850","5557530"," I'd be a filthy pig if I was a woman. "
"5558450","5563650"," I'd be treating men like, I'd be treating men like they deserve it."
"5564490","5566590"," They've been, they've been chauvinists for so long."
"5566890","5567510"," They deserve it. "
"5570390","5573110"," Coming into some resistance right here on the five minute trigger."
"5574590","5575450"," On spoos."
"5578880","5581560"," Keep your eyes right now on that five minute trigger. "
"5588400","5593760"," You want to see if we can break through this five minute trigger right now and squeeze up and trade"
"5593760","5597380"," the half an hour trigger and the hourly and daily right here."
"5599760","5602740"," You're looking for, if you're a bull, you're looking for this right here."
"5614090","5615830"," That's your, that's your trade right there. "
"5617470","5622550"," If you, if we break above this red line, you could reenter for a second trade."
"5624830","5626330"," The person that we take the money and run in."
"5626870","5634570"," But if you break in here, you could take that if, if it breaks higher, but personally take the"
"5634570","5639470"," money and run right there and look for the bounce rate. "
"5639970","5641330"," I'm being kind of sloppy here."
"5644100","5646560"," Shouldn't be that sloppy with my, with my stuff."
"5659920","5661280"," Did you close your puts?"
"5661600","5662320"," Let me ask you that question. "
"5662320","5663980"," Did you, did you close your puts?"
"5678890","5679370"," Yeah."
"5679530","5681490"," Dr. Copper sitting right on its support."
"5683150","5685650"," NASDAQ sitting right on 15,000. "
"5686290","5687470"," What is Vic's trade?"
"5687690","5689450"," I haven't looked yet, but what's Vic's trade right now?"
"5690590","5692210"," I'm going to assume it's at 20."
"5701040","5703660"," So the Vic's high was 1978."
"5705460","5707060"," On a 15 minute chart. "
"5707060","5717380"," I got 1976"
"5717380","5719780"," on 1976, baby."
"5721560","5723500"," Is it the bicentennial, wasn't it?"
"5724500","5729940"," And I got another target above of $20.79. Let me"
"5729940","5736470"," get rid of this."
"5736590","5737810"," You guys already know what it looks like. "
"5738410","5739250"," That shit gets sloppy."
"5742110","5743930"," Looks sloppy in a chart, so."
"5746930","5747990"," Nor Cal Joe. "
"5748330","5750850"," Thank you for mentioning that in the chat."
"5751050","5751910"," I appreciate your brother."
"5752430","5756890"," Nor Cal Joe just said a giant SPX put position was just closed. "
"5758410","5760650"," You kind of want to be underneath, right?"
"5761230","5765910"," You don't want to be opening any spy puts here unless we break below this level."
"5767230","5771670"," NASDAQ needs to break 15,000 and start rejecting 15,000."
"5772150","5775330"," Start opening new SPX puts, in my view. "
"5782010","5785390"," To the point, join us on YouTube."
"5785950","5787130"," Thank you for joining us, brother."
"5787370","5787950"," I appreciate it. "
"5787970","5788430"," How are you doing, man?"
"5789270","5790250"," How are you doing to the point?"
"5792890","5794510"," Appreciate you becoming a member, my brother."
"5796130","5799850"," David AMS. Good to see you, my brother. "
"5800650","5803510"," Do you guys don't know who David AMS is?"
"5803910","5808530"," He's one of a very tight, cadre in our discord."
"5809290","5812410"," He is one of the best traders that I know out there."
"5812930","5813790"," Him, John L."
"5814070","5818070"," Those guys are some of the best traders that I know in the market right now. "
"5819250","5824550"," So if you guys don't know who he is, he's stopping in right now in YouTube to say hello."
"5825890","5829990"," Find those guys in our discord and watch what they do."
"5831530","5834510"," So David, happy Friday, happy weekend. "
"5835210","5836830"," I wish you well over the weekend."
"5838290","5840630"," I wish you safety over the weekend as well, my brother."
"5846080","5846640"," TGT. "
"5848040","5850460"," To the points asking, my thoughts on TGT."
"5852340","5853960"," Roger, let's take a look at it, brother."
"5854500","5856140"," We'll take a look at TGT right now. "
"5871300","5873540"," TGT increases the spike market slip."
"5873880","5875000"," Here's what you need to know."
"5877280","5879100"," What's their earnings date on TGT?"
"5879300","5880260"," It's not showing over here. "
"5886420","5889980"," Does anybody at the top of the head know the target earnings date?"
"5890460","5891880"," I can look it up on Yahoo, but."
"5894400","5896220"," Dude, I got some cool shit for you too."
"5896440","5897520"," You guys want some cool shit?"
"5897520","5901360"," I got a bunch of cool shit right now for you. "
"5903480","5905100"," When's Twitch target earnings date?"
"5905740","5907080"," Probably not for a while, right?"
"5907240","5907520"," What is it?"
"5909020","5913200"," Is it November 15th, right?"
"5913400","5914600"," So another month from now, right?"
"5915420","5916700"," November 15th, is that correct?"
"5917640","5918420"," You guys want some cool?"
"5919760","5920360"," Hold on."
"5920480","5922000"," Let me see if I can bring this up."
"5926330","5932310"," Someone asked in the chat at the end of the day yesterday, why is there no data on the website?"
"5933490","5937730"," So it's a, the website has placeholders right now. "
"5938470","5940150"," That's why you don't see any live data."
"5940610","5945270"," The live data, once the website goes live, that live data costs me."
"5946010","5951770"," It's anywhere from eight to $15,000 a month, so you'll see placeholders. "
"5952490","5958030"," Someone asked in the stream yesterday, I have placeholders for when we run the data live."
"5958290","5958970"," It's very expensive."
"5959930","5961650"," So it's going to cost me a ton of money. "
"5961910","5966570"," So until we get the website up and running, you won't see any live data stuff."
"5967510","5968850"," We're going to look at something cool."
"5969250","5970190"," What's something super cool?"
"5973980","5976240"," I don't know what a can and can't show here. "
"5976580","5977040"," Hold on here."
"5978340","5990650"," So they can, they can do this on a, you guys"
"5990650","5991550"," want to see something cool?"
"5998810","6003350"," We got a, we got a, we have an earnings calendar for the website now."
"6004630","6009270"," So this is tradethetrigger.com backslash economic data calendar. "
"6010770","6014830"," So our website now has an economic calendar that you can click on and fuck around with."
"6015310","6020590"," So we've now, we have, we have actually have a whole page dedicated to earnings calendar stuff."
"6021430","6022250"," So that's kind of cool. "
"6022530","6022810"," Kind of neat."
"6023810","6025430"," So we've got earnings calendar stuff here."
"6025950","6028050"," Oh no, this is, oh no, this isn't the earnings calendar. "
"6028230","6028810"," We don't have that yet."
"6030470","6031670"," That's not the earnings calendar."
"6032070","6033090"," Scratch what I just said to you. "
"6033570","6035030"," That's the economic news calendar."
"6036170","6036790"," Scratch all that."
"6036870","6037410"," It's not up yet. "
"6037670","6038750"," I thought it was up, but it's not."
"6040190","6043270"," So we've got, but we do have an economic, we have an earnings calendar coming."
"6043270","6044890"," It's the only reason why I'm bringing that up. "
"6045710","6046830"," Because someone was asking about TGT."
"6048110","6048990"," So TGT."
"6049990","6052430"," Let's take a look at TGT in a 30 minute chart. "
"6052710","6052910"," Damn it."
"6053090","6054310"," I thought I had an earnings calendar, but I have it."
"6054410","6055450"," That's an economic news calendar. "
"6055810","6057070"," Scratch didn't even said that to you."
"6059910","6060350"," TGT."
"6062110","6064870"," What do you need to know about TGT?"
"6065850","6067250"," Two important things. "
"6068710","6070690"," I'm going to show you two things on TGT."
"6073950","6076130"," Whenever we're rounding, that's positive, right?"
"6077510","6078390"," Positive, positive."
"6080150","6084230"," But there is a risk of rejection to the downside. "
"6084830","6085970"," So you'd see something like this."
"6086990","6088350"," And then back down again, right?"
"6088570","6089950"," Like we did back over here, right?"
"6090130","6090410"," Do that again?"
"6090750","6091250"," Come back down."
"6092010","6092530"," Failure to launch. "
"6092830","6093930"," What does this mean right here?"
"6096090","6096530"," Right?"
"6096810","6097370"," What does this mean?"
"6097490","6098510"," This failure right here."
"6098590","6099050"," What is that?"
"6099230","6100130"," Do you want to know what that is?"
"6100690","6102050"," It's where the trigger is."
"6102930","6104050"," The daily trigger. "
"6104350","6105570"," So let's look at this one right here."
"6106370","6107090"," Bring this down."
"6111640","6112120"," Right?"
"6112340","6114260"," So you get that nice roll up here. "
"6114780","6115540"," Failure to launch."
"6116380","6118280"," Back down to the dull bottom, right?"
"6119120","6119660"," On velocity."
"6120360","6121820"," So what is that telling us?"
"6123040","6127480"," It tells us that bears are selling off on that daily trigger, right?"
"6128780","6130600"," Using it as a springboard. "
"6130680","6132040"," We talked about that this morning, right?"
"6132660","6135400"," We talked about when we're when we're bearish."
"6136060","6138840"," They use the daily trigger as a sell point, right?"
"6139180","6140460"," Sell point, right?"
"6140720","6141960"," Sell point, sell point."
"6142460","6147460"," And what are we coming back into right now is a very similar moment, right?"
"6148040","6151500"," Coming right into this same moment, right?"
"6151620","6152200"," We're right about here. "
"6152960","6156740"," So you're going to pound it, pound it, pound it, pound it, and it rejected, right?"
"6158970","6163370"," So let's talk about a trade on TGT."
"6165250","6171990"," We know right now that the daily trigger is being used as a rejection point, right?"
"6173110","6178670"," So you have a trade as long as you're above the hourly."
"6179550","6185510"," You have a trade just right there. "
"6185670","6185910"," That's it."
"6185910","6193130"," Your target right now is 113.62. You exit your longs."
"6197090","6198930"," You have a lot of work as a bull, don't you?"
"6200130","6205230"," You exit your longs at 113.62 or just below it. "
"6206010","6209210"," Personally, right now I would not be in this trade personally."
"6210090","6212050"," I would not be long here if it was me."
"6212910","6218250"," What I would be looking for is the squeeze above. "
"6218250","6223130"," The pullback consolidation."
"6225910","6231990"," And for this, for this green to cross."
"6233650","6235190"," That's your hourly trigger. "
"6238440","6240360"," And for this yellow to cross."
"6247450","6253130"," Personally, I would love to enter TGT with a break above."
"6254130","6256230"," I can actually see right here. "
"6256970","6259130"," Let me mute my fucking camera."
"6259270","6260650"," You don't need to see my mug."
"6277930","6280090"," I want to see that squeeze. "
"6281170","6283230"," I don't want to see the squeeze only get to here."
"6283350","6285950"," I want to see the squeeze push up to right here."
"6288150","6290810"," I want to see consolidation. "
"6292930","6295030"," And then we can trade this one right here."
"6309060","6310460"," There's one right there too."
"6311680","6316840"," You got a ton of volatility in here. "
"6322800","6324220"," That's why right there."
"6325220","6327100"," That's why you have volatility here."
"6327300","6328640"," This weekly trigger is coming down. "
"6328940","6330900"," The next two, three weeks, this weekly trigger."
"6334100","6338060"," It's next like one week, two weeks, three weeks right there."
"6339080","6341620"," One, two, three, about three weeks right there. "
"6341880","6344400"," That weekly trigger is going to come down to 125."
"6346120","6350380"," So this 125, 130, I would say, stay the fuck away."
"6351560","6352120"," So. "
"6355720","6364870"," Make that red."
"6372360","6375160"," I'm going to get rid of this green line because it's sloppy, but you know what I mean?"
"6375220","6379460"," You're looking for a daily and hourly cross with consolidation."
"6396750","6398670"," About three weeks away, somewhere in there. "
"6398830","6399790"," This looks like dog shit."
"6400410","6401730"," This does looks like dog shit."
"6402350","6403510"," But you get the gist, right?"
"6403670","6408910"," Squeeze up, trade 112, 1758, consolidate, break higher. "
"6410170","6416650"," Trade 192, consolidate a little bit, break higher, 122, 94, break up and your price target is 124,"
"6418230","6421090"," 72, possible extension up to 130."
"6422970","6425450"," I would not be caught dead long in here."
"6426890","6429070"," As this comes down right here, right?"
"6431550","6438450"," If price does break above, I would wait for the daily to catch back up in the hourly and catch"
"6438450","6444190"," that consolidation to then trade it higher to your next stuff, which would be. "
"6446230","6447510"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"6448150","6450730"," This right here is going to be a big one for you."
"6451110","6453910"," It's going to be like consolidation over here. "
"6455350","6458230"," They're going to try to sell you the fuck down over here."
"6458310","6464750"," They're going to fashion smash you because your next level is way up here."
"6464750","6470550"," You're monthly right there, right there, 167. "
"6471630","6473130"," They're not going to let you get there that easily."
"6474250","6481170"," If at any time you see price break below the hourly daily trigger or reject the weekly or monthly,"
"6481710","6484830"," we will reverse to the downside on TGT."
"6486170","6487630"," Does that help you out right now?"
"6488390","6489170"," Bull share though. "
"6489850","6495390"," The one thing I will also say to you on TGT, one other thing I would say to you on"
"6495390","6503610"," TGT is if you reject 113.62, you're going to the depths of fucking hell, man."
"6509050","6511210"," You want to know where that next lower target is?"
"6517620","6518660"," Oh, baby."
"6521900","6531670"," $78.41. If you reject this daily, if you reject this weekly, any rejection on weekly"
"6531670","6539730"," here at 125.130, you'll be retesting the low at 107.01 and you will see 78. "
"6541550","6546430"," 78.41. TGT."
"6555510","6559930"," That makes this shit so awesome is when you come into these support and resistances, you just"
"6559930","6566430"," fucking exit your longs, exit your shorts, break below it, get back in short, get back in long, and"
"6566430","6567110"," you're off and running."
"6567370","6568570"," You don't break the hourly trigger. "
"6568570","6572710"," You're consolidating, waiting for the hourly trigger, up or down."
"6572930","6575510"," The daily trigger consolidating, breaking above, breaking down."
"6576610","6578270"," Great fucking signposts. "
"6590170","6597130"," Remember that I showed you, get the squeeze up here, break down, squeeze up, break down."
"6597390","6600210"," Now looking, you're looking for this to hold on spy."
"6601210","6603610"," You're about to get a bull cross right now. "
"6603610","6609950"," If you can hold 4.2267, if 4.22, hold on a second there."
"6611290","6612870"," Back down here, fam."
"6641920","6643460"," Your stops aren't actually here. "
"6643560","6644600"," Your stops would be up here somewhere."
"6647400","6648060"," Stop's meaning."
"6648660","6649700"," Let me see if I explain this better. "
"6653540","6663270"," If you bloodbath right here, if this rolls, if this, if this, if you bloodbath"
"6663270","6665930"," this cross, you trigger your stops."
"6666070","6667090"," You don't actually stop there."
"6667110","6667870"," You stop up here. "
"6669150","6672830"," Not up there, but you like, if we roll it down here, right?"
"6673890","6678270"," And you trigger your stops, you're going to wait for one more pull back before you actually get"
"6678270","6678450"," out."
"6678650","6680290"," You actually get out up here."
"6681570","6683190"," I shouldn't write stops there. "
"6683330","6689560"," I should say stop alert."
"6689560","6694980"," I don't know if it's alert, but."
"6697080","6699540"," So you're trying to buy a dip on this cross right now?"
"6701220","6704400"," You're trying to buy this dip to go up, right?"
"6705000","6712880"," But if you have a liquidation break down here, and this triggers your stops, you don't actually"
"6712880","6713860"," stop out there. "
"6715220","6717840"," So if you go down here, right, you get your stop alert."
"6719660","6722600"," You would actually wait for pulls."
"6726240","6728600"," You'd have that last little bit right there. "
"6728800","6730820"," You'd actually exit your long right here."
"6734300","6737460"," And then you'd finally get the roll of the down side right there."
"6737720","6739960"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, just like that. "
"6741180","6743320"," So stops are stopped triggered."
"6744540","6746580"," Actually exit higher, right?"
"6746760","6749120"," So your stop alert triggered is right here."
"6751990","6753250"," Like trigger to stop. "
"6762800","6764120"," I'll show you what that looks like."
"6764700","6766620"," I'll just snap a line for it."
"6767300","6768740"," So you're buying the dip right here. "
"6770540","6773980"," If it fails, instead you're buying the dip and it fails down here."
"6777070","6778790"," That's where you get out of your long right there."
"6789530","6791210"," So you're trying to buy a dip right?"
"6791570","6793510"," Like buying some calls and buying some calls. "
"6793910","6795770"," I'm long, yes, I'm long, yes."
"6796670","6799650"," Goes against you, gives you a moment to actually get out."
"6799650","6802050"," And then you get out in the market blast down. "
"6805990","6807290"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"6807450","6808350"," You guys understand all this stuff?"
"6809430","6811450"," You guys don't understand this stuff?"
"6811690","6816090"," Then I got to do some fucking videos for you."
"6831830","6832930"," Yeah, did you close your put?"
"6832950","6834510"," You've closed your put, John Klopp?"
"6835590","6836190"," Good job."
"6836930","6837930"," I closed mine too, man. "
"6838770","6839770"," It smells good."
"6848920","6851200"," See you guys are saying in YouTube right now."
"6854440","6855720"," You need what?"
"6860790","6864110"," Hold on, Cap, I need 434 squeeze and I'm done for the day. "
"6864830","6865990"," Yeah, you do, don't you?"
"6867450","6869570"," You need that 434 in the money, don't you?"
"6869830","6871210"," And then you're getting the fuck out for the day?"
"6874750","6885690"," You're like,"
"6885890","6889010"," just give me that sweet sweet half hour hour trigger."
"6889730","6891870"," Daily trigger and I'm out of the fucking market."
"6891870","6893630"," I'm going to go home and have a great weekend. "
"6899390","6901890"," Right now I use tasty trade."
"6902170","6906270"," I've been trying to get off tasty trade and I'm still using it for some things."
"6906930","6909570"," I'm using tasty right now still for futures. "
"6911290","6913830"," I've stopped buying sell futures on tasty still."
"6914490","6918150"," And I still am trading some fucking zero dates on tasty."
"6918150","6925370"," I left some money out of tasty and then I left some money in tasty and I'm making money on"
"6925370","6927230"," that money so it's staying in there right now. "
"6927990","6929850"," So I'm still fucking trading tasty."
"6930550","6932990"," Still, I don't want to anymore."
"6933150","6937890"," I've got money elsewhere and it's like a relic and I'm still using it right now. "
"6940830","6942350"," I got money everywhere, dude."
"6942830","6946790"," I got fucking, I got money and I'll open up."
"6946790","6951370"," It's like one day I opened up Robinhood and I was like, I got money in Robinhood. "
"6951510","6953670"," I haven't traded in Robinhood and fucking forever."
"6954550","6956430"," Like I've got like three or four."
"6956710","6958130"," I got, I got two Robinhood accounts. "
"6958430","6959590"," This is another fucked up thing."
"6960750","6964170"," I've got accounts opened in my name, my wife's name."
"6964670","6967670"," I got two Social Security numbers going. "
"6969110","6973590"," I got like, I got a tasty, dude, tasty."
"6973590","6975730"," I've got like eight accounts on tasty."
"6977430","6979170"," I got accounts on tasty. "
"6979830","6980290"," Thinkorswim."
"6980830","6983070"," I've got accounts on what else?"
"6983630","6984090"," Robinhood."
"6985130","6989570"," I think I still have accounts on Webull but I took the money out of there I think a long"
"6989570","6991490"," time ago. "
"6992170","6996230"," I got accounts littered all over the fucking place and I'll like open one up and be like, oh,"
"6996430","6997070"," there's money in there."
"6997310","6997430"," Awesome."
"6998610","6999610"," Let's fucking trade it. "
"7003230","7004490"," I'll get pissed off."
"7005530","7008750"," I'll get pissed off and be like, fuck this, fuck this broker."
"7009270","7011650"," And I'll switch brokers and I'm like, oh, I got money in there. "
"7011690","7011790"," Sweet."
"7011910","7012930"," Let's just start trading that shit."
"7014110","7014710"," That's true. "
"7018130","7020090"," Yeah, I got my, it's like my wife."
"7020770","7022450"," My wife trades and shit."
"7022670","7024130"," So she invests in stuff. "
"7024890","7027150"," Kids trade, my kids trade and invest."
"7027150","7030370"," And so we use both Social Security numbers."
"7031110","7037350"," So I've got like, when I go to log into brokerages, it offers me like both, right?"
"7037590","7041150"," Like my wife's brokerages, my brokerages, that kind of stuff. "
"7052810","7054870"," I love Ibika KR."
"7055190","7057370"," Do you like it better than light speed, David?"
"7058050","7060250"," Do you like it better than light speed, brother?"
"7060930","7062530"," I like Ibika, by the way."
"7063610","7072910"," As a matter of fact, I was looking at them this week to, I was looking to see if I"
"7072910","7078950"," could design charts and indicators and embed their charts on a website. "
"7080050","7081990"," Last two weeks, I was looking at Ibika."
"7085430","7091230"," Yeah, I like the 5.3%. And I've got money in wheat, no matter of fact, if you have money,"
"7091310","7091610"," we will."
"7092730","7094150"," My wife's got, well, not me. "
"7094290","7098570"," My wife's got money in Webull right now because we got that introductory rate on Webull."
"7099210","7100950"," We've got a savings account there."
"7101070","7102570"," We have a savings account with Robinhood too. "
"7103290","7104050"," We got money in Robinhood."
"7104470","7108510"," Like any of these brokerages that pay 5%, I've got money in those accounts right now."
"7111690","7114210"," And I like prime brokers for buying stock. "
"7115990","7117910"," Like I like going direct to a bank."
"7121090","7122930"," Now, David's posting a link right now."
"7126150","7128190"," Can I copy that link address and put it in Twitch?"
"7130890","7132810"," Dave, I'm going to post this in Twitch, brother. "
"7140300","7141020"," Whoa, whoa."
"7142360","7143440"," I don't know."
"7143780","7144480"," Sorry about that post. "
"7145020","7147020"," Sorry about that dog shit post I just made."
"7147200","7150660"," I tried to copy the link on YouTube and it had like a big like."
"7152020","7153340"," Hey, this comes from YouTube. "
"7153500","7156480"," So I apologize for that on Twitch right now."
"7156900","7157740"," It's my bad."
"7161060","7162040"," That's not us. "
"7162220","7162840"," That's not spam."
"7163660","7165100"," It's just underlying."
"7166100","7167320"," I didn't put a shortener on it. "
"7167340","7168900"," I didn't know YouTube had all that background."
"7172140","7172620"," Yeah."
"7172920","7173500"," Band Hammer Captain. "
"7173900","7174680"," Band Hammer Captain."
"7176040","7177600"," Band Hammer Captain."
"7177780","7178760"," Band Hammer Captain Jim James. "
"7180420","7181760"," So right now we're testing."
"7181760","7187640"," Right now we're testing the cross right now on the one in five minute trigger."
"7188660","7190480"," You can see the cross happening. "
"7190740","7192100"," You saw what I said to you earlier."
"7192320","7194120"," I want you to know if you're buying this dip."
"7194640","7196480"," It's a good learning moment right now. "
"7196580","7198340"," If you're buying this dip right here."
"7201700","7207960"," And if you're, this is a good dip by, by the way, if it, if it bloodbath oftentimes right here,"
"7208080","7213060"," you'll get, you'll say, you'll hear people, you'll hear people call this a liquidation break."
"7213960","7218780"," You'll hear other people call this stop hunting. "
"7220460","7222500"," If you see this breakdown below."
"7224700","7227720"," And you see a failure on this cross."
"7230020","7234400"," If this, if this fails right here, it's going to reverse heavily to the downside. "
"7238600","7240260"," It's going to, it's going to blast down."
"7240260","7246640"," Now, if you see a failure here in this green, the green candles actually squeeze up."
"7248900","7250380"," It's on like Donkey Kong. "
"7253060","7255200"," You're going to get the cross right there again."
"7256040","7259500"," Cross will come out and then we'll start, we'll start blasting to the upside."
"7261980","7262500"," Whoa. "
"7267690","7271950"," So, so if you see this liquidation, watch the liquidation break right now, watch this shit."
"7273030","7274750"," See this liquidation break right now."
"7275990","7279070"," What was, so watch this right now, this whole setup right here. "
"7280230","7282350"," Okay, like snapshot in your mind."
"7282550","7284630"," Take a mind picture, okay."
"7285750","7287550"," See the liquidation break happening. "
"7288310","7290010"," People say, oh, stop hunting."
"7290790","7294050"," The liquidation break and you see it right here."
"7294350","7298610"," What you're most concerned with here is the second bar. "
"7300590","7301730"," You're concerned with."
"7302630","7304730"," You're concerned with this bar right here."
"7305470","7306210"," You're not concerned. "
"7306470","7307710"," This, this, this doesn't mean too much."
"7308250","7310090"," This is the, this is what matters here."
"7310410","7312570"," Any total rigs, a prior of 619. "
"7314530","7317310"," So let's see what the, let's see what the next green bar is."
"7322050","7323830"," We'll see if we get the reversal to the downside."
"7325230","7327290"," Let's put, if you bought this dip right here, right?"
"7329250","7332090"," And it's, it's now you're getting liquidation break, right?"
"7333230","7335190"," Do you like panic sell your calls here?"
"7336090","7336770"," Masking you. "
"7336950","7338070"," Are you panic selling right now?"
"7338210","7339890"," You're getting, you're getting crushed right now, right?"
"7340010","7340770"," You panic selling this?"
"7342270","7343830"," I personally wouldn't."
"7344610","7346750"," I would wait for it to come back and then reject."
"7347570","7352910"," Now sometimes you'll lose, but most of the time, there'll be a pullback up here. "
"7357670","7359830"," Watch that nice break right there."
"7360630","7362210"," Squeezing you out right now."
"7368620","7369280"," Squeezing you. "
"7369360","7371820"," You probably bought like a 10 cent call right here."
"7372760","7374200"," It's worth like two pennies."
"7375100","7376760"," You slam the sell button. "
"7378060","7381560"," And then you watch your, your 10 cent calls that went to two cents."
"7382620","7385820"," Go back to eight cents or 10 cents where you had, would have had an exit."
"7403710","7404990"," Bro, they did it again. "
"7405170","7406950"," They liquidated the liquidation break this."
"7409750","7413990"," They trapped us, bro."
"7424350","7426510"," When do I stop waiting for what?"
"7429030","7431070"," I don't understand the context of that question. "
"7436680","7437820"," Explain yourself better."
"7437960","7439040"," I just don't understand what you're asking."
"7440540","7442620"," Maybe I missed something that you posted above. "
"7444460","7454380"," That I'm"
"7454380","7456060"," waiting for it to come back up."
"7456440","7463930"," Oh, when I'm talking about waiting for it to come back up, I'm going to, you're going to see it"
"7463930","7464610"," happen right now."
"7465230","7465810"," You're going to see it. "
"7465870","7467150"," I'm going to explain it to you right now."
"7467170","7467770"," You're going to see it happen."
"7468830","7470450"," So you bought calls right here. "
"7472550","7477350"," For like as an example, if you bought this cross, this bull cross, right?"
"7479890","7481630"," Say this costs you 10 cents."
"7483770","7485530"," Let's say you're doing this in futures."
"7486090","7486610"," Then this is futures. "
"7486890","7487230"," It doesn't matter."
"7487330","7488190"," My physics ticker."
"7488510","7489990"," I don't give a fuck of this ticker or not. "
"7491970","7494310"," Or SPX spy doesn't fucking matter."
"7494790","7498990"," It's the same setup in every goddamn ticker on the internet, on the stock market."
"7499650","7502910"," So you buy calls here, right?"
"7503250","7504930"," They trap you and send you to the downside. "
"7506130","7510150"," Your long ES, you panic."
"7511370","7512330"," You sell."
"7513530","7515190"," And they just took your money, right?"
"7517670","7523130"," So you just got taken for 400 bucks, 300 bucks, 700 bucks on ES. "
"7523890","7525630"," Many or some shit like that, right?"
"7525830","7526510"," The micros."
"7527970","7530290"," And they just, they just squeezed you out right there."
"7530950","7535610"," But they actually gave you a chance up here to exit, right?"
"7536270","7538870"," So you got like, you got like bloodbath down here. "
"7539690","7546210"," And then they gave you the opportunity to get back out where you took the long right here."
"7546210","7546830"," Does that make sense?"
"7548510","7550930"," But you could have had an actual opportunity to get out."
"7551150","7551610"," Does that make sense?"
"7552130","7553950"," So your losses are not as bad. "
"7554570","7556070"," So let me explain this better."
"7556410","7565030"," So price comes up, right?"
"7565610","7567890"," You don't have any of this information yet."
"7568130","7568410"," Hold on. "
"7573830","7576070"," You don't have any of this information yet, right?"
"7576690","7578250"," You don't know any of this yet, right?"
"7579950","7580590"," Hold on a second."
"7580870","7582150"," Let me black all this out here."
"7586340","7588140"," You don't have any of that information, right?"
"7592160","7593900"," So we bounce up here, right?"
"7594080","7594880"," We get the bull cross. "
"7595820","7597420"," We're going to check the bull cross."
"7598780","7603560"," Personally, I like to see price already start going up and then pull the trigger on it on now at"
"7603560","7604380"," the top of the hour."
"7604420","7605320"," Do you get the US?"
"7605540","7606980"," But let's say, let's say you did. "
"7607080","7612860"," Let's say you bought the, you bought the bounce right here in 1997 total rigs, a price of 619."
"7616760","7619720"," And we rocket ship and you're like, whoa, we did it."
"7619900","7621020"," Make a money. "
"7623520","7625460"," Now let's say it goes against you."
"7625860","7626700"," You buy the dip."
"7626960","7628580"," You didn't wait for the actual start to rip. "
"7629040","7629720"," You just bought it."
"7632860","7634580"," And it fails on you."
"7634820","7637380"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"7637740","7639320"," And you're like, shit."
"7640860","7642060"," We're going to the depths of hell."
"7642220","7648020"," But you're almost always, not always, but about 80% of the time you're actually allowed. "
"7649380","7655160"," You're actually given an opportunity to exit."
"7657020","7659180"," So now you unfuck yourself."
"7659720","7666520"," And you say, oh, dude, they took me, they took me down here, then they're back up here and pissed"
"7666520","7666920"," off. "
"7668200","7671140"," Now, if you come back up here, do you stay in the trade?"
"7671820","7671940"," No."
"7673520","7675120"," You actually exit."
"7675760","7678080"," Lick your ass, your wounds and all that shit. "
"7680220","7682060"," And then you learn your lesson in weight."
"7684660","7686380"," And get a better position."
"7686720","7688060"," Let's say it goes up anyways. "
"7689060","7689760"," It doesn't matter."
"7689920","7691780"," You're going to have another chance to get back in."
"7693960","7695600"," Pulls back again right here. "
"7696320","7697740"," And then you try it again."
"7697740","7702590"," And you buy that dip right there."
"7702670","7703290"," Does that make sense?"
"7704010","7706470"," So you're managing your entire trade history. "
"7707230","7708670"," How many of you out there?"
"7708790","7709730"," Let me ask you a question."
"7709910","7710930"," How many of you out there?"
"7712490","7713670"," Let me ask you a question."
"7713810","7714670"," How many of you out there?"
"7716730","7718370"," How many of you out there right now?"
"7718710","7722810"," You don't always win these, but most of the time. "
"7723510","7726690"," How many times do you guys get into a position long or short?"
"7730550","7736270"," You're like down significantly on a squeeze or a liquidation break."
"7737010","7740070"," And then it reverses back down to your original position."
"7740950","7744590"," And you would have lost minimal money or been flat. "
"7745650","7747150"," You guys see what I'm saying?"
"7747150","7752490"," So you take a short, we squeeze and then it all it all retraces."
"7752770","7752950"," Right?"
"7753810","7755870"," So you're getting squeezed out and you're like, oh shit."
"7755870","7758490"," I'm upside down five grand in five minutes. "
"7759210","7762630"," So you cut your short lose, rolls back down."
"7762950","7766910"," You look at what you would have lost and you said, fuck, I just lost 5k."
"7767190","7769690"," I probably would have lost 300 bucks. "
"7770310","7771750"," Same thing on the other side of that."

"7785230","7786550"," Yeah, popcorn trade. "
"7787270","7788630"," But it's stressful, right?"
"7794080","7796280"," So Shaq saying it happens so many times."
"7796420","7797560"," I know it happens to you guys."
"7798820","7800520"," So put this in your toolbox. "
"7803020","7804420"," Put this in your toolbox."
"7805500","7813160"," That if you take a trade and it goes against you, you have a high probability of being able to"
"7813160","7814540"," exit at a better price."
"7814960","7817340"," Even if you're going to take a hit at a better price. "
"7818640","7824100"," How would you know right now here if you're not going to get that better price?"
"7824940","7828400"," So let's say you buy calls right here."
"7830500","7832140"," They roll it down on you."
"7833860","7837000"," And there is no, it just blood baths. "
"7838600","7842180"," How do you know that you're never going to make any money back?"
"7842380","7843120"," It's only going to get worse."
"7846220","7848340"," You know that it's never coming back."
"7848440","7851660"," If you were to break right here, it should expand right here. "
"7852140","7856820"," So what I'll do is that it'll come down here and you'll start rejecting right about there and right"
"7856820","7857140"," there."
"7857880","7863740"," So if you never get the opportunity, as a matter of fact, yesterday was a great example of that,"
"7863920","7864020"," right?"
"7865880","7867480"," If you feel like, well, fuck it."
"7867520","7870540"," I'm waiting for this bounce here and you don't get the bounce. "
"7870540","7873240"," It breaks right below this previous low."
"7873240","7876740"," Or even this previous low."
"7877480","7880940"," You know likely that they ain't waiting for you. "
"7881960","7884080"," So you do take the L."
"7884220","7884800"," You're like, fuck it."
"7884860","7885510"," I just got torched."
"7886200","7891180"," But that torch is likely one out of two out of ten trades. "
"7892300","7892760"," Does that make sense?"
"7893040","7901140"," Like real, like instead of taking eight or ten devastating losses, you're only taking one two"
"7901140","7902060"," devastating losses."
"7903100","7906540"," You're managing the losses in the wrong positioning."
"7907880","7908580"," Does that make sense?"
"7908840","7910860"," We're talking about just losses here. "
"7910980","7911980"," Not wins, just losses."
"7926600","7926960"," Yeah."
"7927740","7927940"," Agreed. "
"7928340","7928720"," 100%."
"7937020","7937400"," Yeah."
"7937540","7938640"," Jimmy, making a good point too. "
"7938740","7939680"," I agree with you too, Jimmy."
"7939880","7941600"," Jimmy, you've seen me on the stream all the time."
"7942200","7943920"," People are like, I mean, I lose those trades sometimes. "
"7944340","7946920"," People are like, why the fuck is he buying all those red candles?"
"7947760","7948800"," They're like, you're crazy."
"7949040","7949700"," I'm like, fuck no."
"7949700","7950660"," I love buying red. "
"7950900","7951920"," Like more red the better."
"7954500","7956020"," Buy red never green."
"7956940","7965000"," So Jimmy Barry on YouTube just said, that's why I teach people to buy put options on green candles"
"7965000","7970220"," into supply and red candles into demand for calls. "
"7971320","7972360"," Not an easy thing to do."
"7972480","7972940"," Is it Jimmy?"
"7973640","7975320"," Not an easy thing to do."
"7976700","7980600"," It's very, it goes against everything your brain is telling you to do. "
"7985130","7987490"," And the other thing is that don't diddle in the middle."
"7988050","7989990"," We haven't talked about that today to people."
"7991130","7992990"," Don't ever get caught in the middle. "
"7993290","7993630"," Ever."
"7994730","7997730"," The simplest way to describe don't diddle in the middle."
"8001770","8006030"," The easiest way to describe not diddle in the middle is like, um. "
"8008210","8012730"," This right, I'll show you two examples, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"8012930","8013270"," Right?"
"8013510","8021310"," Usually between, um, a one in five minute trigger or an hour and daily trigger or a daily and a"
"8021310","8024610"," weekly triggered timeframe that use timeframe doesn't really matter, but."
"8026450","8031030"," Well, if you come into, if you're going up and you come into known resistance. "
"8041500","8043560"," Never fuck around in here, right?"
"8049210","8050930"," This nonsense in here."
"8063060","8064800"," This is like the killer."
"8065500","8067260"," Do you know if this is going up or down?"
"8067600","8067880"," Fuck. "
"8068100","8068880"," No, you don't."
"8069480","8069960"," Fuck."
"8070180","8072180"," No, there's no guarantee that you're going up here. "
"8072280","8073880"," You could just as easily reverse."
"8075540","8076020"," Downside."
"8077780","8080700"," What you're doing is you're like a, you're like a shark. "
"8084500","8087600"," You're like a, this is going to be a stupid looking shark, but."
"8089060","8090920"," I feel like a shark up there."
"8091120","8091180"," Right?"
"8091300","8091560"," It's a fish. "
"8091740","8095460"," I guess not a shark and you're a, you're a shark over here."
"8095840","8097480"," It's a fucked up looking shark too."
"8098820","8103000"," But you're looking for the break below to your like set up puts here. "
"8104300","8109140"," And when you're up here, when price is coming up here, you're setting up calls in case you break"
"8109140","8110860"," above that, that middle, right?"
"8110860","8112680"," You never mess with that."
"8113280","8115080"," You never mess around in here."
"8115260","8120160"," You're always like waiting down here or waiting up here for the break up or the breakdown. "
"8127740","8130200"," On a higher time frame, what is this called?"
"8132700","8134780"," That's a, that's did on the middle, right?"
"8134880","8136860"," At a higher time frame, this is did in the middle."
"8138740","8142000"," On a lower time frame, what's did alone in the middle?"
"8145140","8145800"," Right here."
"8149440","8150720"," That's did alone in the middle. "
"8152420","8152840"," Right?"
"8153080","8154620"," One in five minute, diddling in the middle."
"8160800","8163100"," Never want to get trapped in this, this shit here."
"8163300","8164400"," A finger trap, right?"
"8164760","8165880"," Finger trap, diddling in the middle. "
"8181400","8182840"," Yeah, we got a short right here."
"8185400","8188040"," So here you're giving an opportunity to get out right there."
"8189220","8191280"," There's your rejection on the five minute candle. "
"8191639","8193020"," We're likely going to bloodbath this."
"8193139","8193860"," You want to see a bloodbath?"
"8195100","8197600"," We have a likely bloodbath coming the next few minutes."
"8197920","8198620"," Watch this right here. "
"8198740","8200320"," See that reversal candle right here?"
"8200680","8201120"," Tweezers."
"8202760","8204700"," Likely going to see a bloodbath right now."
"8205700","8206860"," Let me turn some music on for the bears. "
"8210820","8212240"," Let's get some bear music on."
"8214660","8215660"," It's Friday, baby."
"8218520","8219620"," Show me that blood. "
"8229420","8235379"," Come on, give me that blood."
"8239790","8241230"," Hold on one second here."
"8242549","8246389"," If you're selling this, where your stops?"
"8250559","8253080"," Do you know where your stops are if you're selling this right now?"
"8253760","8254620"," They're up here. "
"8255400","8257500"," They're right above this five minute trigger."
"8258600","8259540"," Around oil ministers."
"8259780","8261299"," This trade turns on you. "
"8261320","8263879"," The price of oil will reach $100 per barrel."
"8264180","8265600"," You get a squeeze right there."
"8266320","8267480"," Where do you get out of your short?"
"8268879","8270920"," No, you don't get out of your short right there. "
"8271540","8273420"," You will get out of your short down here."
"8273700","8274180"," Does that make sense?"
"8276040","8278740"," That's the inverse of the bull trade that I just showed you."
"8305190","8305990"," Look at that. "
"8307309","8308070"," One baby."
"8308370","8309410"," Look at book map over here."
"8309570","8309889"," Watch that. "
"8310030","8311870"," We've got new lows down below for book map."
"8315070","8318850"," Let's see if that supply is the same place as before."
"8319250","8319930"," Let's look at the book map. "
"8320110","8320590"," The folks are."
"8323389","8330980"," I want you to be aware of this."
"8331520","8332680"," Take a look right here. "
"8332760","8334440"," This is the previous low on book map."
"8334440","8340700"," We have new supply showing up even lower than the debt than the weekly trigger This is the weekly"
"8340700","8392260"," trigger looks like we're gonna get a break of it right now Oh, yeah"

"11388160","11391680"," What what a bear wants is they don't want to see this do they?"
"11392580","11402480"," bears want to see the bloodbath and then the rejection right and Currently they're not seeing that"
"11402480","11408360"," are they you're seeing price get above the weekly trigger That's parking itself It's gonna probably"
"11408360","11413620"," consolidate for a couple seconds and start to squeeze up and Higher so you get this first one right"
"11413620","11418520"," here, and then you get this next one right here So right now it's parked right here, which is good"
"11418520","11426200"," to see Still no still no reversal, but you see the cross right here This is that second attempt at"
"11426200","11429580"," a cross that we had down here See that cross right there."
"11429740","11436240"," You got another one forming right now for an upside move See a couple targets the upside we'll draw"
"11436240","11444620"," some lines in right there for you I was aimed at preempting market volatility that could emerge"
"11444620","11448580"," from maintain We'll do another small little pivot point right here and today pivot points right"
"11448580","11453960"," there and there We'll see if they can hold this I'm gonna just zoom in a little bit for you"
"11455320","11460280"," Remember we discussed this earlier to right have another cross coming up right here What do you"
"11460280","11463940"," want to see right you're like okay I'm gonna buy the dip liquidation break come back up and then"
"11463940","11470180"," run to the upside So if you're looking for liquidation dip dip by there's s1 right there So keep"

"11491200","11497060"," It's supposed to be D and then you can put another one down here by the fucking dip By the"
"11497060","11504900"," fucking dip right here So if you're first dip by right here By that and then DC a that one"
"11504900","11511380"," right there there and there Personally for me, I'm gonna look for the liquidation break and then"
"11511380","11515660"," the bounce right there So we'll check that out see if they can jump on that training get up there"
"11516600","11518820"," So I'll keep an eye on that and see if they can buy it."
"11518920","11525560"," Let's take a look at a Let's quickly take a look on Spy on a zoom out a little bit"
"11527220","11530500"," You Have the you have the potential to go upright. "
"11530600","11540440"," So this morning pre-market This morning pre-market right we got above so we didn't get the"
"11540440","11548560"," bear cross We waited for The bounce did not show itself, right?"
"11549360","11558380"," Bought some puts took this all the way down Back up right now."
"11558520","11561600"," So let's look at something important here I want to show you guys something here."
"11562080","11564500"," So I'm talking about trying to buy a dip down here, right?"
"11564680","11566700"," What is what's what's showing itself here?"
"11567460","11574240"," I'm very concerned right now with this cross taking place Do you see that cross taking place right"
"11574240","11578620"," now this big white line this what white line crossing this red line right here?"
"11579080","11585520"," As this cross is it can trigger some very violent reversals to the downside and price over here So"
"11585520","11591560"," just be careful So there can be it there might be a trap here is my point or might be"
"11591560","11598100"," a trap where we are let me switch back to the Trigger screen screen There might be a trap right"
"11598100","11604060"," here as this cross takes place on the hourly So just be be cautious buying a dip here that can"
"11604060","11607920"," roll this to the downside One more quick bloodbath to the downside. "
"11608580","11614480"," So if you are looking to buy the dip here it can be risky Let me go back to that"
"11614480","11619320"," one minute chart I'm weebel and Maybe this looks all good."
"11619520","11623600"," This all looks great This look this all looks good to buy the dip to get the V shape of"
"11623600","11629500"," cover You got the holding of the weekly trigger, but for me, but I'd really like to see like I"
"11629500","11636780"," would really like to still see Something like that and then still get that that white line cross"
"11636780","11641120"," right there get that white line going up there So so far I'm not gonna buy this I'm gonna wait"
"11641120","11641620"," a little bit longer."
"11642280","11647140"," I don't need that and I don't need this I can buy that I can buy this right here. "
"11647600","11652620"," I don't need to buy this one right here So I'm gonna hang tight And why am I hanging tight"
"11652620","11655560"," and not buying this dip or even this one down here?"
"11656040","11662520"," Mostly it has to do with that big cross on that hourly trigger watching that confirmation cross"
"11663280","11665240"," This does not look good to me."
"11665420","11666780"," This looks very unhealthy."
"11667140","11668660"," Do you know what happens when you get that cross?"
"11668900","11670120"," I'm gonna show it to you right now. "
"11671040","11676180"," I Want to show you an example of that cross and what takes place when it actually crosses, right?"
"11676900","11683820"," You have the initial breakdown You get the cross and it just rejects to the downside, okay?"
"11684620","11689300"," I'm gonna show you another cross like that in previous history and why I'm scared of it."
"11689460","11690800"," Here's a big cross right here, right?"
"11691900","11698880"," There's the actual cross right there So you come down you get the pump and then it just grind"
"11698880","11706920"," sideways and more down right more down so Think about those examples when you get a one hour cross"
"11706920","11716220"," and We are likely due for we are likely due for some kind of rejection Some kind of consolidation"
"11716220","11722460"," and continued rejection to the downside So if you wanted to buy a dip here you can it's possible"
"11722460","11729160"," you can buy the dip here And make some money here and here, but we have a confirmation So far"
"11729160","11736840"," right now the confirmation of a of a one hour cross to the downside on spy This is very bearish"
"11736840","11737060"," air."
"11737280","11742540"," So even if you're like, yeah, I'm bullish gonna squeeze up And all that kind of stuff. "
"11742920","11750860"," There's likely now a minimum of a zone of consolidation between 432 and 444 and Likely more"
"11750860","11752080"," downside to come."
"11752540","11760780"," So this is more of a repositioning for bears For sellers than it is for buyers to buy a dip."
"11761020","11767080"," We have likely not seen the last down yet So just be aware of that So let's look at this"
"11767080","11775960"," the screen right here the idea here would be You're at high risk of You're at high risk of"
"11775960","11785580"," continued selling You're at high risk of Consolidation with more down to come So again"
"11785580","11792280"," unless we get above the hourly trigger Or we hit those targets to the downside still not really a"
"11792280","11798480"," buyer Intraday you could be you could be an intraday buyer here, but for me not a buyer as of"
"11798480","11798660"," yet. "
"11798660","11805980"," No no no rush no need to We'll see what we'll see what the interaction is down here and see"
"11805980","11812820"," if we can start to I don't mind trading this right here If it starts to present itself, but don't"
"11812820","11816360"," be buying like a dip and think and you're out of the woods as a bull And we're gonna just"
"11816360","11822960"," run up and off That's highly it's the probability is against you unless we're above this this stuff"
"11822960","11827500"," up here You need to get above it hold it and then get above it So there's like sex there's"
"11827500","11828260"," a trade here."
"11828760","11830060"," There's a trade here."
"11830100","11839140"," Oh my delete all this If you're a bull If you're a bull one trade"
"11839140","11849380"," two trades and then you have the squeeze in the consolidation new trade so one two"
"11850160","11859160"," three Pullback confirm for over here Definitely don't want to like put all your money here and just"
"11859160","11861400"," ride this fucker all the way up Don't do that. "
"11861480","11864260"," Don't ever do that if you want to put all your money in that trade."
"11864460","11865340"," It's not here."
"11865680","11867960"," It's not here It's not here. "

"14495690","14505490"," here Because of where velocity is even if price traded sideways And expect a high a bigger"
"14505490","14511730"," move in 7.3 percent and I think Netflix is kind of famous for this too So my hope here"
"14511730","14519530"," is that we trade down Into a 325 into next Wednesday That we come in the weekend we get a"
"14519530","14527070"," bloodbath come down here and then we just rip faces up there We can trade like 328 to like 384"
"14527070","14532850"," or something like that up there So that's my hope is that Netflix is bearish down into their ER"
"14532850","14542750"," report, but saying that Saying that if if at any point You See Netflix"
"14542750","14565430"," above 360 likely gonna see this kind of action here It's"
"14565430","14570650"," a 360 any kind of squeeze and this could possibly hold up here It's possible it just pins at this"
"14570650","14579990"," 376 or whatever But I'm betting that I'm betting that they think it's gonna be good So I bet I'm"
"14579990","14584390"," gonna bet that the deal is gonna hedge that down short that shit down of the dumpster fire Cuz I"
"14584390","14589050"," don't I don't think they want price up here at like into their ER and then they're squeezing off of"
"14589050","14594070"," that so I Hope that that happens. "
"14594270","14599570"," I hope that this reverses to the downside because I would love to buy that fucking thing I'm"
"14599570","14606030"," interested in buying zero dates on Netflix into their ER if we can get down to that 325 very"
"14606030","14613470"," interested And I'll pay it to I'll watch this one the next few days if this starts to round to"
"14613470","14618850"," the upside and this this rounding right here Should provide that squeeze but I want to see that"
"14618850","14623910"," trap in here I want to see that fucking trap on Netflix because I think you do get that outside"
"14623910","14628890"," that outside rip to the upside and Let's go back to that daily chart."
"14634050","14643580"," Oh Yeah, dude look at that That's that bloodbath down there and you get like a good ER"

"14671140","14675640"," I think you guys think that Netflix looks bad I don't agree with that. "
"14675760","14680760"," I bet they come out and they announce some kind of price increase They said something about it this"
"14680760","14685760"," week They were gonna raise prices and that they're like 30% of subscribers said they were gonna"
"14685760","14688260"," quit our cancel I don't believe those subscribers."
