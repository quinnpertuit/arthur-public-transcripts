"LVhVNiVeHNA","12360","14280"," This is tomorrow on Tuesday."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","14280","19240"," We don't have anything on our economic calendar, but we do have Joe Biden giving his speech."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","19240","23720"," There should be some volatility with his speech, and I wouldn't always consider his speeches"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","23720","25240"," to be positive."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","25240","29920"," He tends to want to come, come markets, but I wouldn't ever be surprised to see him"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","30080","36240"," dump some bad news on the markets on the Tuesday before Christmas."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","36240","39800"," And because we've got some volatility hanging into the rest of the week on Wednesday and"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","39800","40800"," Thursday."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","40800","43440"," So just keep that on your plate that it is volatile."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","43440","45000"," You never really know what they're going to say."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","45000","46880"," It could be something to calm the markets."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","46880","50320"," It could be something that's negative to the markets."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","50320","53320"," We know what we think that it's going to be a couple of COVID."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","53320","58360"," He'll probably bring up something about GDP as well with that news being dropped on Wednesday."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","58360","62800"," And it would not be surprised that he brings something up about that as well as the Fed"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","62800","69760"," is on vacation right now after working so hard this year, quote unquote."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","69760","72760"," But we need to talk about what's going on in the market right now because it is very"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","72760","75720"," important for you if you're invested in this market."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","75720","81680"," If you did not hedge above here or hedge into Friday, this is interesting too because I made"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","81680","85120"," some good money hedging this position, this position here."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","85120","86800"," I didn't get my hedge until end of the day."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","86800","90160"," I bought a bunch of colfties and my account burned."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","90160","94760"," Like I had some pretty severe burning in my accounts going into Monday morning."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","94760","101440"," My hedge didn't really cover as much as I anticipated it to through the volume drop off."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","101440","104960"," The really what anyone that's telling you, I don't know what I guess the real the real"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","104960","109800"," place I should have made money was in the Sunday to Monday overnight in futures trading"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","109800","117040"," that or hedging there, but having just having me just trade cash market and relying upon"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","117040","121960"," puts to print into today that wasn't that it wasn't as good as it should have been anyone"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","121960","125200"," telling you that it was it was okay, but it wasn't great."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","125200","127600"," It wasn't what it should have been I guess in my view."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","127600","132920"," So anyways, the thing the key thing about this overnight though to Monday is that we've been"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","132920","138320"," green into Sunday would be unusual and in my point in my view point it would have embarrassed"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","138320","141200"," this sell off down here should have been expected."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","141200","147720"," But what didn't take place at 4am was a harsh reaction and it did not carry over into cash"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","147720","148720"," market."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","148720","153280"," We should have been if it was a normal traditional year Monday of OPEC's we should have been"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","153280","158560"," somewhere up here at 460 on a good year possibly even for 70 today."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","158560","161560"," That's how much how big the reaction should have been."
"LVhVNiVeHNA","161560","166280"," This is a word of caution to you if you are a bull the market this morning when we opened"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","166280","176520"," and we sold down there was a prime opportunity there to sell down and test for 5448 and that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","176520","182760"," would have set us up for either direction would have set us up for a really nice long"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","182760","188280"," short on the market bear country type stuff something where you could kind of grip on"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","188280","195600"," to and say we are in bear town and had we bounced off those numbers down below here you"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","195600","199120"," would have seen a very strong reaction to all-time highs it would have been to like"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","199120","206560"," 478 0 4800 it would have been a stupid rally but we didn't really get that down below here"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","206560","213200"," but what did happen was we formed a base and you could see it in book map the sellers"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","213200","219040"," were being absorbed we had a couple price targets to sell the market above at that 45"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","220000","229680"," 458 and 460 we were starting to build a base now that does lend some positivity to the bulls"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","230320","239040"," that they need to test for 4600 tomorrow or in the overnight for a push up to 474700"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","239600","242880"," and there were some clear skies yesterday heading into the end of the day"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","243520","248320"," you just started to see more of a base form and some of the call hedge wall"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","248880","256160"," raised up higher from 460 to 4700 now that could be a carrot that could be a fake out"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","257280","262400"," but that was forming today into the close you have to be aware of that if you're a bear and a bull"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","263040","267600"," but the one thing I want all of you bears and bulls to understand is the play if you were a bear"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","267600","274400"," today was to let off your shorts and puts down here and wait for this next attempt at 4600"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","274960","283520"," 460 it's pretty close to the same area on the spy and the es i would say it's 4600 on es"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","284080","291920"," and it begins at 47 or about 458 on the spy into tomorrow so this is cause for concern even in"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","292000","299040"," the overnight you we could tap let's say we hit 4460 on the overnight we could sell down heavy at"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","299040","305600"," 1 a.m. tonight that's that's on the table now if we don't sell off into tomorrow i'm going to"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","305600","312240"," still tell you every every trade you take on it is so volatile right now that you need to be putting"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","312240","318080"," on some protection whatever you're buying if you're buying a thousand dollars you need to open up"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","318160","325040"," program like there's like options called options profit calculator open that up and find something"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","325040","329760"," that's outside of the money that seems reasonable that will trade to a prime example would be if"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","329760","336240"," you if you're taking long series you'll be taking maybe one tenth of your trade it's been to let's"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","336240","343440"," say a 448 p just enough to cover 10 if it's a hundred bucks of a thousand if it's a thousand"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","343440","349280"," to five thousand you should be buying protection around here either direction that you're trading"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","349280","353680"," okay so if you're trading down below here this morning you should have bought some outside the"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","353680","359120"," money calls if you notice today into the close so this this afternoon i'm on up buying some more"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","359120","366320"," call fd's down here and they were in the red slightly the entire day the moment we went into"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","366320","372080"," close yesterday some premium kicked in i it wound up going down like i think i was down five or"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","372160","376720"," ten percent all day long even though we were going up and then once we got into the after hours"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","376720","382160"," they cranked that was up like 30 percent or something like that so you have to put you have to buy"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","382160","386160"," and i think these calls down here that about when they were weekly for like 30 cents they"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","386160","391760"," were 465 from friday and i think they cost me no the amount of cost me 30 cents or 60 cents i"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","391760","396240"," haven't looked yet but they were cranking them they were cranking towards this close over here"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","396240","400480"," so if you bears do that you know you buy something really cheap they should start to print at the"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","400480","405200"," trades going the wrong way for you be cautious of this now what does this mean as we head into"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","405200","411440"," the rest of the week okay and that it means that we are looking for that now we're looking for"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","411440","418080"," a test of this 460 area if we don't if we reject off of this we're going to trade down hard down"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","418080","425360"," here and if we trade down hard down here we are going to start drilling through this support if"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","425360","430160"," we start drilling if we reject office and start drilling down this root support down here or if"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","430160","436400"," we don't start bouncing around for a move higher or lower later then my expectation would be"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","436400","442480"," anything below here you're full bear you're full bear this market for the next one to three months"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","442480","448000"," at minimum and i'm you got i'll show you guys some other charts here in just a moment to explain"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","448000","452720"," why it's going to take that long if we start drilling down below here but this is definitely"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","452720","458480"," bear country just be aware of this okay if we get down here we start pounding through this 4500"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","458480","464560"," this 4850 area somewhere down in here we we are in bear country now i don't want to hear anybody"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","464560","469120"," talking about being a bull after that okay we're selling rips we're going to don the bear suit and"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","469120","476000"," that's that's all it is now here's one last point if we break through this 4600 or if we bounce around"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","476000","481520"," down here long enough and we don't drill through this this level you're going to see a rip that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","481520","486400"," that you haven't seen in a long time you are going to see what i mean what is this down here you're"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","486480","492000"," going to see something like uh what is that like uh i don't i don't know what how many points that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","492000","498320"," is but you'll see 150 point rip or something stupid all the way up to this 4800 it'll be"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","498320","504000"," abrupt too it'll be a turn it'll move it'll move just like this one did over here it'll move just"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","504000","509040"," like this one did over here and we have one we have a similar one back here if you look at this one"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","509040","514480"," down here this is pretty much what i'm talking about you see that move you're going to see that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","514560","521040"," move if we don't if we don't pound through this 4850 this uh 4500 you'll see that move in a day"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","521040","527040"," or two three days they'll probably take like you know the end of a trade and then we'll move over"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","527040","533040"," a day and a half two days to you know a move to make all-time highs once more it'll be something"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","533040","538800"," similar to this just be conscious of this as we trade forward now i told you that christmas rally"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","538800","545360"," doesn't start until after uh the 25th and last week i talked to you about how i really wanted"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","545360","551040"," to see the VIX at 30 or or 27 point something right so we're going to look at it right now"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","552240","557840"," you really want to see the VIX up there you know we we kind of closed the gap today at 27"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","558400","564160"," and i was talking to you about this on twitter today about this 27 16 i think i even tweeted"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","564480","570480"," about this right when we were at the top over here and i like this i like this closure i like"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","570480","576240"," this gap closed over here it's kind of closed but not really so what does that mean for us does that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","576240","584080"," mean we trade up uh through 460 maybe we get to 470 right and then we sell down from 470 heading"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","584080","590400"," into the after christmas let's say we we drill we start drilling down from 470 and then we we"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","590400","596240"," slingshot back up to 30 to get that actual christmas rally start to think about the VIX and where"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","596240","603440"," it's at and how it plays out with the narrative of a santa rally because right now this doesn't"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","603440","608880"," fit a santa rally it fits a good rally this week but it doesn't fit a santa rally without"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","608880","616480"," us selling down to get some point into tomorrow or into thursday thursday friday okay now there"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","616560","621600"," there's one other bull thesis that would say yeah we can we can sell this down here and then we"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","621600","628240"," can start selling down into the 12s and the 13s and the 14s i don't believe that that's like a"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","628240","635520"," fomo bear to me that's a more like fomo that fomo bull uh thesis i'm not really invested in that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","636320","641120"," so i just need you guys to understand that so maybe we trade up tomorrow which seem"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","641120","648880"," logically we trade up to 460 possibly 465 let's say we begin to sell down that raises the VIX"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","648880","655760"," on bad news for the rest of the week gets us into this 30 into this into this 30 zone on the VIX"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","655760","661760"," and you'll hear people crying about the markets gonna go bear town and then on friday at the close"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","661760","668480"," you buy some calls and sure enough on the 26th or 27th whatever that monday is you'll see us sell"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","668480","674400"," down from the 30s we'll have you know a brand new day brand new year we'll trade up into all-time"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","674400","681680"," highs rolling into the first second week of january so just keep all this in mind as we move forward"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","681680","686480"," start to put the pieces of the puzzle together as a trader put the pieces of the puzzle together"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","686480","691200"," as a bear or a bull as we move forward you want to be looking all these indicators looking at the"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","691200","697360"," news the economic news what the markets trying to tell you and this is the same thing on es you"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","697360","702560"," saw the we have that bounce at 4am wasn't good enough we wound up bouncing up during"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","702560","708320"," during cash market today again we're looking at this 4550 as critical support I mean this is it"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","708320","713440"," right here bear town bump down below bear town 100 percent you're going to start looking for"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","713440","719520"," some targets down below that are going to be are going to get gnarly what no doubt about it we'll"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","719520","728320"," look out here make this an auto and you're going to start to want to see you know 431 to 426"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","729200","734800"," you got a free fall down to 414 and ultimately if we break below this critical support"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","735520","741600"," i'm probably going to take some shorts heading into march for 395 that's how bearish i get i don't"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","741600","746320"," know how bearish you get but i'll get i'll get quite bearish in this move down here this is how"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","746880","753920"," this is how when we started selling down in march you had a couple days in this area to put some"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","753920","761520"," real serious shorts on some real serious puts puts on before we started trading down and when you"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","761520","766560"," do when we start trading aggressively down here if you're a bull you need to be aware if you've"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","766560","773760"," never traded a bearish bear town bear country it gets violent so and you only get so many chances"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","773840","778800"," down here to actually take this bear trade on i want you to be aware of this if you are long"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","778800","784320"," this market uh you'll say you'll guys will tell you to just to just hold through a move like this"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","785200","791760"," i don't know what i can say to i think if we break below this uh and hold a break below this 4500"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","791760","800000"," 4480 would be a critical number as a as a stockholder i would sell out of my position you would be"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","800000","804160"," i mean i can't say that you should i'm not going to give you that financial advice but if we get"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","804160","810960"," down here right it's going to get ugly i guarantee it 100 i bet the bears know that too i bet the"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","810960","816880"," smart bears out there nowhere we actually need to be to get bearish down here in some real deep"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","816880","822640"," price targets this is kind of the area down here where you will start to see the market fail now"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","822640","829280"," the one issue with us failing down here is they'll there should be some nice up and downs it shouldn't"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","829280","837440"," be violent like covid it's going to take a lot to trade down out of iwm i was looking at iwm"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","838000","843600"," iwm in their volume and market profile trying to look back like six months that a year today"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","843600","849600"," i was doing some research on it it's going to take some time to to unwind the trade from iwm"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","850240","856560"," it it would fit the narrative of at least a month i guess if i don't i don't i don't know"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","856640","861760"," on a very aggressive sell-down out of iwm if you're going to if you're going to kill that"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","861760","868080"," covid trade like that it could take a month and then if you weren't as aggressive could take three"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","868080","874560"," months if the market did it slowly it could take you know up to a year we could have a sideways"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","874560","880400"," down market for one to two years i don't know where they're taking us with that i don't you"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","880400","884320"," don't know i don't know there's nobody on twitter that knows there's nobody on wall street bets"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","884320","888960"," that knows there's nobody on youtube that knows how long it takes to trade down from here"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","889920","894560"," or if we even trade down from here but i just need you to know that when we start breaking this"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","894560","899440"," area over here we're not only going to retest that we're not going to just retest this area over"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","899440","904640"," here we're going to start trading down so we really need to be aware of that okay as we move"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","904640","910400"," forward now i want to also show you nq nq we had the same sort of thing happen today"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","911360","915760"," we traded just above the put wall you know this isn't healthy when you see stuff like this"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","916400","922160"," you really want to see we have the volatility trigger above it for 15 9 30 i think this volatility"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","922160","927760"," trigger is lowered i haven't looked into it yet but i'm thinking that it's down around 15 8 47 i did"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","928320","934240"," record and post some some big numbers for you guys this morning i have to go back into that video"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","934240","939600"," and see where the volatility trigger has moved but this isn't a good sign this is not healthy when"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","939600","945040"," you start to see bounces like the start to see these lower lows down here this is not a good"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","945040","950160"," sign for the market it's not a good sign even if you're playing these rips it's just not a good"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","950160","957040"," sign it's not a good look it's a look to retest much lower lows over here from previous time frames"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","957040","967360"," okay somewhere down here at 14 900 and then even or excuse me 15 000 and then down to 14 591"
"LVhVNiVeHNA","968240","973840"," so be conscious of this this is looking like the weakest index the the point that i would give"
