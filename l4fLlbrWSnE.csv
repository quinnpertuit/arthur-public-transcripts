"10","7010"," Welcome to check on to check on to Mike check."
"8610","9890"," See everything on."
"10730","11490"," It's on. "
"15630","16430"," Where?"
"21970","23130"," Where the hell am I?"
"45230","46150"," Let's go."
"46150","56560"," Oh, check"
"59350","63569"," one, two, get a turn that shit down."
"70590","75250"," All right, let's see if we can get everybody's coming in here. "
"79560","80940"," What's up, multi-stream."
"83420","85080"," Good morning, we're all of course a good morning."
"85320","86340"," Arthur Solom. "
"87320","88160"," What's going on?"
"88500","89140"," Stacey, good morning."
"90040","90900"," It was a great day out there."
"91800","92960"," Let's go right into it. "
"93280","93920"," Good morning."
"94960","96100"," Happy back to work week."
"96500","100100"," I was supposed to be on yesterday and I was in some meetings. "
"100520","104760"," Or I was in video conferencing that I couldn't get out of those meetings."
"104760","106460"," I thought I would have a stream up yesterday."
"106740","109040"," So I'm assuming that people are going to be like, oh, I didn't. "
"109080","111320"," Come on Monday because he's upset for Friday."
"111320","114860"," So we'll talk about that as well this morning at some point."
"115440","120780"," And the pin from Friday as well, we're going to talk about into the end of month. "
"121360","122620"," Let's see, just a few seconds here."
"122720","124100"," I got a few things I got to do in the background."
"125060","126200"," Good morning to you. "
"126280","127560"," I hope you all had a great weekend."
"128500","130860"," And I was pretty pissed off on Friday, right?"
"131060","132800"," You guys saw me leave the stream on Friday."
"132800","135540"," I was like, I'm going to kick my desk over. "
"135960","138260"," It was pretty, pretty angry at myself."
"139200","141500"," So we'll talk about that as well at some point."
"141780","144100"," And give me just a second here. "
"144160","145460"," I got a few things I got to do in the background."
"147220","148760"," Hold on one second here."
"153800","154280"," Members. "
"156700","157180"," Save."
"159740","160840"," Good morning, Michael."
"164540","165140"," I got a few things I got to do here. "
"181070","182370"," Yes, yes."
"187190","188130"," Cues we'll look at."
"188330","189610"," We'll look at Tesla probably. "
"190690","191530"," And maybe some Apple."
"201000","202720"," So we're going to talk also about."
"204200","207220"," There's a, there should be a pin on the marketplace on Friday. "
"207240","208340"," I talked about this."
"208920","212780"," We're going to go back and hit it again this morning."
"212780","213560"," Give me one quick second. "
"213560","216980"," I just got a couple things I got to do here to get this show up and running."
"218820","220990"," There we go."
"223350","223950"," All right. "
"224690","225110"," Good morning."
"225230","225790"," How's everybody doing?"
"226930","228930"," So you got a bunch to talk about this morning."
"228930","232890"," I'm sure you guys are all eagerly wondering what happened on Friday. "
"234550","238190"," Or what my reaction was on Friday to take a pretty big loss."
"239530","243150"," The week was a red week for me not by a ton."
"244130","250070"," But overall, I was actually up on the week and I placed a sizable bet on Friday. "
"251150","255050"," And then I dug my heels in on that bet and it came back later in the day, but it"
"255050","255829"," didn't really matter."
"256470","258329"," They came back later in the day."
"258329","261410"," Now, they actually actually closed that trade, reopened a second trade. "
"262430","266510"," They printed a little bit, but it doesn't matter."
"267610","273850"," I took a pretty big fucking loss and what's fascinating to me about it was."
"274690","279270"," Had two other things going on in the background of, well, first of all, this should hold. "
"279670","280970"," You guys want to know here."
"282530","286530"," This should we should hold here and we'll talk about that in a moment."
"287570","290370"," But here you can look at the 30 minute chart right here. "
"292090","295550"," Saying that that this should hold if we do break for 30."
"296010","298910"," I mean, break and break it like we start breaking down here."
"299170","300950"," It should be pretty bad. "
"301050","304130"," We are on the put wall right now in the intent here."
"305010","306810"," Let's do an overview of where we are in the market."
"306990","307230"," Let's start. "
"307410","308330"," Let's go back for a minute."
"308330","317130"," So on Friday, as I was talking to you guys about gamma on Friday, there's a pin on Friday."
"317290","319910"," There was a pin on the market and there's a pin. "
"320050","323950"," There was a pin yesterday and there's a pin today as well down here."
"324370","332370"," I had been reading to you on Friday that the market hedge was not monetized."
"332510","334910"," Well, it was monetized and then it was rolled. "
"337790","340710"," Rolled like like we're going to buy more puts with our winnings."
"341070","342870"," So I've made a bunch of money."
"342970","344650"," Now I'm just going to throw some extra puts on. "
"345750","349790"," For an attempt for a 420 into end of quarter."
"350650","354290"," So like we know bull the bull case is out the window at this point."
"355110","358570"," And the second issue is going to be. "
"359750","363650"," As we came down to Friday is a market pinning action."
"364190","366670"," And you're seeing that play out right now."
"369770","372450"," Now dealers, they're going to keep us here. "
"372950","378070"," They're going to keep us here more than likely into end of month."
"380190","384430"," We'll talk about Jerome possibly or probably trying to talk the market up from here."
"384650","388150"," But saying making that statement, this is where we're going to stay. "
"389270","390250"," Believe it or not."
"391770","393590"," This is the put wall right here."
"393830","399230"," If we do begin to break down, we could get an amplified move down to that 420. "
"400290","401830"," Into end of month and end of quarter."
"403470","407210"," And there's this part of the quarter where it's self realization."
"408070","412670"," We talked about that earlier in the end of the month or the beginning of the end of the month. "
"413210","415910"," That there could be self realization that we need to go higher."
"416610","419010"," To nail that upside target into the month."
"419270","424490"," And that same thing applies that same concept applies to end of quarter. "
"425190","428670"," Or the lower strike on the caller."
"429030","430950"," So that's something that where we have to go there."
"430990","434630"," But if we all believe that we're going there and if you see the heads in the market, not get"
"434630","434990"," lifted. "
"435850","439970"," And then just we're going to throw some more cash down for 420 and end of quarter and end of"
"439970","440870"," month of end of quarter."
"440870","443390"," There is a possibility we go down there."
"443610","447250"," So just keep your just keep your cut or keep that idea open. "
"447250","448970"," That is we should pin in here."
"450090","451870"," Into end of quarter and a month here."
"451870","452210"," Right. "
"452330","453090"," It's last few days."
"453310","457570"," There could be some kind of an action going higher as puts burn off."
"457570","461330"," But for for what it looks like, it looks like parking the bus to me. "
"461790","465870"," So it was looking like that on Friday as well."
"465870","472610"," And that's really what what enraged me on Friday was that pinning action."
"472990","475550"," And you could actually see it taking place the rest of the day Friday. "
"475930","479970"," You could see it yesterday and even into this morning when you're waking up this morning."
"479970","484630"," And if any of you held overnight from yesterday into today, no joy, right?"
"485590","488910"," We're just being pinned like like painting action to the marketplace."
"490970","491790"," Let's see here. "
"493270","495450"," Yeah, you know, I'm going to say something to you."
"495510","498950"," If you want to go back briefly to Friday, I lost a ton of money."
"499030","501310"," That was very angry at losing that money. "
"502470","504950"," It took us a pretty substantial hit to myself."
"505210","506630"," I didn't want to take that hit at all."
"506970","510410"," But I got to say something, something that I haven't done before. "
"511010","512510"," And I did over this weekend."
"513690","515990"," So on Friday, I was so upset with myself."
"516270","520730"," I was like, I felt so defeated that I had done that. "
"520730","523810"," But I actually gone against what I had said to do, right?"
"523970","527050"," I was like, I was like the tool saying sell."
"527310","530730"," And here I am being like, fuck you, I'm holding."
"531570","535730"," But I got to say something funny about this because what I ended up doing the rest of that day"
"535730","539930"," was, I'm like, I'm going to get off the screen and get away from the screener this weekend. "
"540590","541810"," But I already had plans to do that."
"542270","549170"," But what I really did was after the day was over on Friday, my friends came and grabbed me."
"549170","553010"," And I went out with some friends Friday night and it was a blast. "
"553450","556070"," And I've never done this before."
"556290","560770"," Whenever I've had a loss, I mean, or even just a big loss where I took it emotionally or into"
"560770","563350"," my head or whatever, I went out and spent money this weekend."
"564170","568690"," And it was, it was, I needed that for some reason. "
"570030","571190"," One, that's some reason."
"571650","575130"," I had some other things going on Friday in the background that you couldn't see."
"575130","585050"," I had a meeting going on with a developer and the work wasn't done, which was"
"585050","586490"," supposed to be done earlier in the week. "
"587810","592250"," And then I lost an auction, a bid on a house."
"593370","596690"," And those three things all together, that was it for me."
"596850","600310"," It was like, boom, why am I doing this anymore?"
"601010","603310"," And I'm trading in a week that I don't want to be trading in. "
"603310","604950"," I didn't want to be trading on Friday."
"605490","610130"," That's hindsight vision, but at the same time, I didn't want to be trading on Friday."
"610530","612270"," And I had already been talking to friends about it. "
"612850","616670"," And as a matter of fact, even yesterday, I had a meeting yesterday that had to do a video meeting."
"617310","619830"," But even this morning watching this action, it's kind of garbage."
"620770","622150"," We'll get more to that later. "
"622710","627730"," But the fascinating thing was on Friday, I ended up going out and having a good time."
"627730","634470"," And then I had more friends invite me out to an overnight for Oktoberfest on Saturday."
"635570","638670"," And then Sunday, I had big Dungeons and Dragons game with a bunch of people there. "
"638870","641150"," So by Sunday, I felt great."
"641730","647690"," So I want to say something about that where I used to internalize a lot of this stuff."
"648850","653470"," When I would make a bad trade or do something, I would break my own rules, that kind of stuff. "
"654070","655430"," And I didn't."
"655590","663770"," I was in a point where I was like, nothing's fucking going the way that I'm expecting things to go."
"663950","665510"," I've got meetings not going their way. "
"666010","667650"," Got an auction not going my way."
"668830","671970"," And then I've got trading not going my way, right?"
"673470","677990"," The action of trying to pin that close on Friday infuriated me."
"678350","680050"," It was like straight and infuriating. "
"680050","683090"," So anyways, I did have a great weekend."
"683250","683830"," Came back yesterday."
"683950","689070"," I was going to put the stream PSA morning and that developer had a meeting with him yesterday that"
"689070","690050"," I couldn't get away from. "
"690130","693290"," There was no possible way at this point because it's like a week late."
"693590","695370"," It's like five days late at this point."
"696530","697910"," So you're watching right now. "
"698130","700110"," Let's go back to where we are right here."
"700250","701670"," So just on this half an hour."
"702750","704390"," We're still in a downtrend. "
"705190","710370"," If you see this weekly trigger break at any point, let's go over to a full screen right now."
"714210","718730"," So you can just see us sitting parked here on this weekly trigger, right?"
"719810","721230"," We know that."
"723210","726370"," We know that if we begin to break below this trigger. "
"727070","728910"," That all bets are off."
"728910","729970"," So here's that 420."
"730590","733810"," Here's where that target is for the JPM caller. "
"735810","740890"," And we're going to watch this here for two major things."
"741150","744510"," And that's going to be two major things here."
"744510","749370"," I want to pay close attention to the first one is going to be this daily trigger above here. "
"749810","755270"," As long as this daily trigger stays above, bowls right now are relatively safe."
"755270","758750"," It acts like a magnet for price to squeeze higher."
"760130","763750"," Although as time does pass, you're watching it come down. "
"764610","766710"," And this is not good, right?"
"766990","769010"," This is actually not good right here watching this."
"769910","774330"," So the bulls still have a chance here for us for price to go higher to try to trade the"
"774330","780430"," 441 39 or even the 440 to try to tag that 440 right here."
"780430","785310"," But even saying that this is not healthy for the bulls the more time that we spend down here"
"785310","786090"," knocking on the door. "
"786510","792010"," If the if we if price does not trade higher and continues to come down at some point, I'm going"
"792010","792690"," to get kind of."
"793630","799450"," Kind of kind of worrisome here that we're going to trade that 420 into end of month."
"801270","806390"," And another one of the macro thing in this number going to go into a bunch of other macro stuff. "
"807770","814070"," You've got you've got to market that instead of taking the hedge off down here, they re hedged like"
"814070","815350"," they bought more hedging right."
"816270","822550"," And we know for a fact heading into end of quarter that you're not going to see money get dumped"
"822550","825970"," into this marketplace where with where we are right now."
"825970","831870"," No one is going to attempt to buy this market until after the quarter is over. "
"832390","836110"," And you're not going to see volume committed the market until after the quarter is over."
"836290","840030"," So that's what the first week two weeks of the quarter."
"840390","845950"," So the expectation here would be are we risk on here more than likely not. "
"846170","850930"," And more than likely not risk on until after the new quarter begins at some point you're going to"
"850930","855550"," be waiting to find out the hedge that comes on to the next quarter of the market to find out"
"855550","860990"," if there isn't even if there even is an opportunity to long this market."
"861450","865090"," So the expectation in 10 of quarter is going to be just a pin in here."
"865730","866130"," Okay. "
"866870","871710"," Unless we begin to break down or we come into some sort of resistance here from the sell off of."
"873490","876970"," You know to the downside at four twenty is just going to be a pin."
"877550","879270"," So just a pinning action. "
"879490","881710"," We haven't seen any closing bars below the weekly trigger."
"882870","884910"," No closing bars in here at all."
"885170","887030"," And right now still no closing bars. "
"887250","889070"," They're still working on trying to hold themselves up."
"889070","891010"," If I was a betting man."
"891390","895410"," If you're asking me if I was a betting man what's going to happen into this into this end of"
"895410","898510"," quarter and the first week or two of the quarter. "
"899010","899830"," It's to the downside."
"900290","904170"," It's more than likely that four twenty fair chance of it happening."
"904170","905070"," Does it happen yet?"
"905450","907790"," No as the hourly broken down below the weekly trigger. "
"907970","912030"," No as the daily broken down daily trigger broken down below the weekly trigger."
"912390","912830"," No."
"913070","916090"," So until we start to get to that point where you start to see this. "
"916090","917210"," Hold on a second there."
"920400","923400"," Where you start to see this daily trigger coming down like so."
"923980","929020"," You see the hourly begin to break below the weekly with price. "
"929600","933560"," This coming down here in price rejecting lower to begin to see this."
"934660","937620"," No no commitment to the downside of that four twenty."
"938820","939280"," None. "
"940020","940080"," None."
"940320","942820"," We could just as easily squeeze up this four forty two."
"943500","944460"," No problem. "
"944460","947900"," We can squeeze up this four thirty one and hold right there for the day."
"948320","949900"," And there it is in a half hour break."
"950360","956220"," Now if you do begin to see this hourly trigger break below if you're going to see closing bars down"
"956220","956440"," here. "
"956740","958500"," We will take this to the four twenties."
"958760","962960"," Matter of fact we are weak right now on the first fifteen minutes or trading four twenty eight."
"964260","966940"," Sixty six and they're trying to get those closing bars. "
"967880","969780"," We are positioned short right now."
"969780","973360"," So if we get to begin to get these these closing bars to the downside."
"973800","977480"," We will take this into end of quarter to four twenty. "
"979460","980420"," Hello ladies."
"983620","984580"," Good morning."
"984580","985380"," How was everybody doing?"
"986120","987580"," Good to see you guys out there. "
"989600","991360"," If I was an ETF you'd buy me."
"993120","994900"," Or ETF you'd buy me."
"996620","999520"," So just for this morning we've got the hourly trigger above here. "
"999600","1001640"," We've got a gap left unfilled to the upside."
"1002260","1005120"," You get the hourly trigger at four thirty one twenty six."
"1006160","1006980"," Right up here. "
"1007120","1008980"," This is exactly where they sold off this morning."
"1009560","1010600"," Just so you can see it."
"1010660","1013780"," They're using this hourly trigger as a cell point right up in here. "
"1014260","1016960"," And to the downside I'm going to show you guys one last thing."
"1018120","1019820"," And we've got a couple more things."
"1019960","1023060"," We've got a previous low back here at four twenty eight twenty nine. "
"1023060","1027680"," And then below that below that an S two you've got a target of four twenty seven forty nine."
"1027839","1031440"," And then four twenty six and four twenty five eighty one to this downside."
"1031819","1032579"," Down in here. "
"1032740","1035300"," And then I'm going to show you guys a gamma map."
"1035880","1039500"," For that weakness in the market heading into the quarter here in just a moment."

"1979210","1985870"," The market didn't like that thesis that the market doesn't like government shutdowns. "
"1986270","1988270"," It's kind of like scratching my head on that one."
"1994580","1996600"," So I don't know if there's an initial rip."
"1996760","1997500"," I haven't looked up. "
"1997620","2000680"," I guess the point being that I didn't look up once the shutdown ended."
"2001160","2005480"," I didn't go back and actually look to see if the market reacted to positive light."
"2006360","2008100"," So I'll have to go back and look at that. "
"2008300","2010920"," But I just saw normal like selling normal buying."

"2046800","2049000"," We keep staying underneath this weekly trigger here."
"2050120","2050679"," And there."
"2050780","2053100"," Let's take a look at this really quick and a better chart here. "
"2061210","2063870"," Maybe I can maybe I can visualize this for you here."
"2071739","2072880"," Or is that daily trigger."
"2077929","2079570"," For 41 39. "
"2105310","2110690"," The one benefit that bulls have here is going to be that daily trigger."
"2113470","2114950"," It is not right."
"2115130","2118970"," It's racing down, but it's not racing down where bears want to see it. "
"2119410","2123810"," And they want to see this daily trigger come flying down here and kind of push price lower."
"2124810","2126210"," But it's not happened yet."
"2126470","2130150"," So bulls do have that on their side for this where this weekly trigger is down here. "
"2130950","2132310"," But even saying that."
"2132870","2134470"," Even saying that."
"2135070","2138890"," This hourly crossing down right now is not bullish. "
"2138990","2141070"," This hourly coming down here to this weekly trigger."
"2142010","2144050"," Is is extremely bearish."
"2144270","2148290"," So we begin to break that 430 which we are right now, right?"
"2148970","2149930"," We're trading 428 11. "
"2149930","2154130"," And if this weekly trigger is able to come down here."
"2154650","2155750"," Keep pushing price."
"2156470","2158730"," It's not going to be good for the bulls. "
"2159110","2164850"," It's going to translate into a break of that put wall and a blast down to 420."
"2165570","2169710"," It's currently it's sitting at 431.08. It's still parked up here."
"2170970","2172170"," Still parked up here. "
"2172210","2172910"," So we have some weakness."
"2173830","2175730"," Hourly is not quite following yet."
"2176870","2178910"," But you know, it's close enough. "
"2179090","2182590"," They sold off on this hourly trigger in pre market here."
"2182670","2184110"," You can see it right back over here."
"2184650","2187570"," And now they're selling off the weekly trigger right here showing bear. "
"2187770","2190910"," Not just bearishness, but just weakness into the market."
"2192350","2194710"," And we should trade that 420."
"2194750","2200090"," I mean, I'm telling like the 420 is easy for us to attain. "
"2200170","2202210"," Easy for us to attain below 430."
"2203290","2205190"," We are currently below it right now."
"2205190","2206190"," We're below the weekly trigger. "
"2206330","2208770"," Anytime we're below this, we're going to get weak."
"2209910","2214050"," And the expectation here is that we'll trade 427 49."
"2215290","2222270"," And there's even a likelihood of 420, 426 34 end to end of today. "
"2222790","2224330"," So we'll see if we can get down there today."
"2224990","2228250"," And we'll catch the rest of that volatility into Wednesday, Thursday and Friday."
"2229350","2232290"," And try to take this market down to 420 and to end into the 29. "
"2236060","2237640"," Leave that up right there."
"2238480","2240540"," And we've got the previous low now."
"2240820","2245620"," And then below this, I'm going to post up the next target to the downside. "
"2274210","2275750"," Right there for you."
"2277990","2281790"," Bringing below the previous low now, trying to tag 427 49."
"2283510","2285670"," Trying to break down and tag it. "
"2286130","2287970"," We'll see if we'll get this here in just a moment."
"2288150","2289890"," We'll leave this S1 right here for you."
"2300400","2302740"," I said that's S1, but that's actually S2. "
"2317260","2318100"," 426 34."
"2333680","2334100"," 426."
"2340940","2343000"," You have stocks extending full here. "
"2343140","2345780"," So this is the S&P now down to one spot, one percent."
"2346140","2348480"," And that's back down one spot, three percent now."
"2348580","2351540"," Spoons looking to trade 427 49 right now. "
"2367400","2371460"," I mean, she goes that right there."
"2371720","2372880"," There's S2 to be tagged."
"2382160","2383580"," Should see a bump here. "
"2383900","2387280"," And then we should chase 426 34 next after that."
"2399830","2401490"," You're going to look for the next cell."
"2413480","2415100"," You can see that right there. "
"2422580","2427340"," Spy tagging S2 at 427 44 on a low."
"2432040","2433960"," Look for 428 25."
"2435680","2438820"," And then a breach and sell the 426 34. "

"2529990","2532470"," The same target as before 73 73."
"2533310","2536890"," No break currently of H Y G on its weekly trigger."
"2541340","2543340"," Still no break of weekly trigger here. "
"2543600","2545480"," They are trying though, man."
"2545640","2546380"," They are trying."
"2546740","2549700"," If that 73 73 does break. "
"2550360","2559360"," You're looking for 73 40 on spoons 73 40 on spoons H Y G below 73 anything below its monthly"
"2559360","2563280"," trigger is extreme bearish extreme."
"2564180","2566700"," A market turns to a bearish stance."
"2567350","2570620"," If we end up breaking that monthly trigger that 73 40 down here. "
"2571420","2574500"," Currently still parked on its weekly trigger."
"2575460","2576720"," Dude, no weight right here."
"2576820","2578100"," Don't even give me a chance to get in. "
"2578780","2579580"," Yeah, damn."
"2582220","2584460"," Should have just stayed on fucking puts."
"2593590","2595970"," It's not even fucking waiting to go down there. "
"2621290","2621950"," Done Brad."
"2622910","2628620"," Yeah, H Y G is still holding their Brad."
"2628860","2633560"," You need to see another dollar another break of a breach of that of where H Y G is currently. "
"2634180","2636700"," And H Y G still has gap to close."
"2639780","2641780"," To 73 71."
"2652760","2658220"," Dude, look at Apple Apple getting destroyed right now. "
"2659420","2661760"," Absolutely destroyed an apple right now."

"2679000","2680980"," I'm getting like teased right now."
"2705360","2706620"," I've got some lined up. "
"2706680","2707260"," I haven't bought them yet."
"2713180","2714780"," I'm watching this H Y G."
"2714900","2717100"," I want to see if it bounces here off this bottom."
"2741780","2743720"," Let me check this 30 minute again. "
"2751810","2753270"," Nope, not ready."
"2774300","2775680"," Still not fucking ready."
"2800140","2804920"," A little bit of bounce on H Y G still has not closed the full gap to the downside at"
"2804920","2806020"," 73 71. "
"2859100","2860620"," Let me just one second here."
"2860640","2861740"," I got to watch something in the background."
"2890970","2894610"," XL K trading checking its previous high here. "
"2896930","2898990"," That one 62 78."
"2899390","2902690"," I was give your attention to XL K."

"2908230","2909970"," Let's look at XL K really quick."
"2922520","2925550"," XL K on a four hour chart here."
"2926310","2927910"," Not much else to show here, right?"
"2928110","2929310"," Pretty big thing to see here. "
"2929390","2931330"," It's pretty fairly simple."
"2932710","2936350"," You can see last known demand here on XL K."
"2937200","2939230"," It's going back to June 7th here."
"2939890","2943070"," Buyers, buyers, trying to break below these buyers. "
"2944230","2951190"," It is a swift, swift move to the downside over here."
"2958850","2960840"," XL K at 160 256."
"2961880","2965800"," Next move down 153 47, right?"
"2966140","2967460"," Pretty fierce move down here. "
"2967460","2969760"," It's kind of like all that support."
"2970080","2971760"," And then all the way down to this bottom right here."
"2971860","2975740"," It's just tapping at the door to extreme bearishness. "
"2979430","2981610"," Even as we are right now."
"2988030","2990150"," Even all this blood right here."
"2992110","2995770"," It'd be very wary of the self from up on high here. "
"3004360","3006080"," You want some blood, baby?"
"3007300","3008500"," Some blood."
"3011100","3013780"," XL F holding on for its dear life as well."
"3019380","3021560"," Same news over at XLC. "
"3022260","3024120"," It still has demand down at 64."
"3025460","3025480"," 45."
"3025820","3035510"," It's currently trading 64.99. XL F sitting on its"
"3035510","3036650"," precipice as well. "
"3037310","3041290"," XL F XL K XL C."
"3042330","3045470"," Probably holding up the best right now."
"3046310","3048250"," It's looking sketchy down there, isn't it?"
"3049190","3061980"," XL F looking to give it up and trade 32.49. It's currently trading 33.51. This"
"3061980","3063840"," looks like a bottoming."
"3065660","3070820"," It looks like a place to buy three month calls. "
"3072320","3073280"," It's close."
"3075580","3076940"," And one quick second here."
"3076960","3077940"," I got to look at a couple other things. "
"3083380","3084340"," It looks juicy."
"3084940","3088120"," I'll say that it looks it looks juicier for bulls and it does for bears."
"3088740","3092700"," And all that'll that'll turn up the fucking turned off bears out there. "
"3094940","3096040"," Hold on one second here."
"3098500","3100000"," What am I going over here for?"
"3106500","3107240"," Three minutes."
"3116870","3121610"," Yeah, a break of 33 and XL F would be bad news. "
"3132490","3134110"," PMO has more down to go."
"3136890","3138690"," PPO's not saying too much here."
"3151320","3161050"," Let me show this to you guys that I'm looking at here. "
"3171370","3172710"," So this is just cycles."
"3175650","3177410"," PPO's still not turning around."
"3179150","3180910"," PMO's still bearish. "
"3183230","3185750"," Just crossing quite violently actually on PMO."
"3186730","3188430"," PPO's still in a downward trend."
"3190590","3192670"," Not looking good for spoos here. "
"3220830","3221870"," Still bearish."

"3274520","3284400"," We should trade 428.98. Still bearish here even"
"3284400","3285020"," with the turnaround. "
"3340280","3341820"," We want a quick seder guys."
"3372220","3378100"," It's the scene that the UK had to sell 2.25 billion pounds of a 1.5% 20.53"

"3661620","3663200"," H.Y.G. trying to hold itself up."
"3675130","3676350"," Give me a quick second here."

"4236010","4241630"," So just as we come into this, we're going to should see a rejection here as we come up."
"4242110","4245430"," I'm going to go flat as we come into this red line up here."
"4246270","4256210"," So just keep your eyes here and then a rejection and then possibly"
"4256210","4258290"," this larger move higher here. "
"4272420","4291160"," Selling 90 on 4.29c. Hold"
"4291160","4291800"," on a second."
"4297590","4298390"," Hang tight guys."

"4470480","4472720"," All right, just checking back with you again right here."
"4473100","4475920"," So let's take a quick look where we are in the market here."
"4477860","4479880"," So just take a look here. "
"4480120","4483920"," How are we going to get a reversal here or not is a question."
"4484340","4485340"," I don't think that we do."
"4486500","4491520"," I don't see this being the bottom right now, but if it does hold. "
"4491940","4494020"," So if this white line right here holds."
"4495500","4497180"," If this holds right here."
"4499800","4509140"," You will be looking for a squeeze to 4.2960. This reversal here, this reversal here and then we'll"
"4509140","4510540"," try to buy this dip over here. "
"4511060","4512460"," But I don't think that this holds."
"4512820","4514600"," I honestly don't think that this holds."
"4514820","4517780"," I think that it's pretty gnarly down here. "
"4517940","4518580"," They're pounding."
"4519780","4525380"," If we're to look right now at trying to pound to get even deeper, right?"
"4526300","4530240"," Like forget this S3, like a straight bloodbath."
"4530240","4535080"," And if you look at XLK XLC, it's not going to be easy to do. "
"4535780","4544320"," But if you look at XLC XLK on a four hour basis, major trend reversal, this doesn't look in good,"
"4544440","4544720"," is it?"
"4545400","4547660"," This is XLK right now."
"4548660","4551900"," And it's looking to erase all of this to the downside, right?"
"4552160","4554400"," Big bloodbath in risk on."
"4554900","4561520"," If you look at XLC, same kind of a deal, right?"
"4561520","4563200"," This is XLC in a four hour basis. "
"4563760","4568900"," We had the low down here at 64.90. This is all known support."
"4570100","4574300"," And what happens when we break below this is it gets nasty, right?"
"4575100","4576520"," Things getting nasty down here."
"4577180","4578260"," It's no fun, right?"
"4578820","4579320"," No fun zone. "
"4579460","4581840"," You got some support down here in XLC in communications."
"4582820","4584900"," But then you got a lot of blood back over here."
"4586020","4588780"," XLF, kind of exhibiting the same stuff, right?"
"4590020","4591320"," Came back down here. "
"4592240","4595040"," If you're a bull, I guess you'd think this is a double bottom."
"4595700","4598180"," We do have a new low down here in XLF."
"4599520","4605440"," XLF wanting to give up down to $32.52. All right, you see that right there?"
"4605960","4611040"," Give up all this stuff up down here and possibly even give up all this stuff down in here. "
"4611240","4613480"," There's some known buyers down below."
"4616610","4619270"," All right, there's some known buyers down here as well."
"4619270","4622990"," But you can see it, right?"
"4623530","4625190"," It's pretty big weakness here. "
"4625390","4627210"," When does that weakness actually transpire?"
"4628690","4632590"," On a one hour basis, it's not looking good."
"4633830","4641250"," The cell came this morning before the open on XLF began selling this down."
"4642010","4644330"," So an hourly basis looking pretty bearish here. "
"4644990","4647030"," On a four hour basis looking pretty bearish here."
"4647730","4653310"," Bulls really don't have a thesis here unless they break above."
"4654150","4656850"," Less price breaks above this hourly trend. "
"4657610","4661070"," So Carly, that's $33.67 on XLF."
"4662270","4665250"," Until then, spoos is going to look weak."
"4666150","4668810"," So nothing for the bulls here right now. "
"4670710","4674710"," Nothing at all here for the bulls unless they start to break above that hourly trend to the"
"4674710","4674890"," downside."
"4674890","4678850"," And to be honest, it's looking pretty fucking weak here."
"4678990","4685410"," Right now trading below the one minute 27 EMA again to the downside. "
"4686150","4690090"," Going to expect a bloodbath off of this right here."
"4690350","4694970"," So going to expect a rejection here and then some kind of blood to the downside."
"4695690","4697390"," Tag out that S3 down there. "
"4698630","4700590"," If it does reverse to the upside."
"4700590","4703090"," If it does reverse to the upside."
"4703910","4708030"," Be looking for taking another set of calls up here. "
"4711630","4715350"," If price can get above and catch across up here."
"4716190","4719390"," So if you're looking for if you're a bull and you're looking for the next buy."
"4720330","4721690"," You need to see price get up here. "
"4722170","4725650"," Get up here and then we can take this trade right here."
"4725650","4726510"," But other than that."
"4727250","4728890"," This is not showing itself. "
"4728890","4733770"," Other than that, the bulls don't have a trade right now."
"4734390","4737710"," So we'd need to see this kind of price action take more calls."
"4738710","4741350"," If anything here, you know, it's looking like that. "
"4741670","4745010"," We haven't seen that bloodbath and this isn't a bloodbath here."
"4745850","4748050"," So we'd like to see that bloodbath at some point."
"4748090","4748870"," We'll see if it happens. "
"4750590","4751690"," Other than that."
"4752770","4754550"," No, no dip buying again here."
"4754690","4755450"," So we'll just wait and see. "
"4756710","4758950"," Yeah, I think there's a I think there's a bloodbath coming."
"4759450","4760430"," It's looking pretty now."
"4760450","4761750"," They're going to bang on it and bang on it. "
"4762170","4768230"," The other thing that's really bad here is the hourly is chasing on the upside."
"4768410","4768790"," So."
"4770890","4773090"," You look on a 30 minute chart here, right?"
"4775470","4776390"," This hourly. "
"4776690","4778650"," Well, it's not actually it's kind of chilling now."
"4779390","4780570"," Not so nasty."
"4780790","4787010"," It's still up up at 431.08. But you know, you get this you get this hourly cross right here. "
"4787350","4790430"," That early crosses that weekly trigger."
"4790930","4793330"," Things are bound to get violent to the downside."
"4793870","4794010"," So. "
"4795850","4797670"," I'm pretty bearish right now."
"4813080","4814040"," Hold the line."
"4815960","4817800"," I'm thinking about some calls. "
"4818140","4820480"," I'm like, Oh, we're kind of."
"4821600","4823260"," You know, if we could get that 420."
"4824180","4825200"," It's kind of nice. "
"4825340","4829460"," We're trading right now for 26.98 in the low."
"4830460","4832920"," It's looking juicy for some call spreads."
"4833460","4836920"," It's definitely looking juicy in that theta burn for the next couple of weeks. "
"4837940","4840000"," I'm definitely interested down here."
"4841420","4842320"," Definitely interested."
"4843220","4844780"," I got to make back a bunch of money. "
"4845000","4845080"," So."
"4846100","4847920"," If you can get me a 420, it'd be stoked."
"4849800","4852660"," It'd be super stuck to be able to get me a 420. "
"4858670","4860890"," Still parked right here in this 2070 ma."

"8462270","8463870"," You got five minutes left, bros."

"8468050","8470330"," I'm laughing because I'm texting."
"8472150","8476390"," I'm texting a team, a team member on Twitter."

"8491230","8492170"," Do you guys don't?"
"8493130","8497030"," So we're talking about posts that are a count building posts. "
"8498530","8501770"," And S&P on credit conditions in North America."
"8501850","8508250"," North America in the fourth quarter says CRE loan losses could rise amid higher financing costs and"
"8508250","8510570"," declining demand for US regional banks."
"8512230","8515330"," I was talking to a buddy in the background and I'm like. "
"8516770","8520230"," We're like, okay, let's start growing this account where these accounts and."
"8522170","8526810"," There's like, there's easy ways to grow an account and there's very difficult ways to grow an"
"8526810","8527390"," account."
"8527650","8529310"," One of the easiest ways to grow an account. "
"8530790","8533930"," Is to say something that everyone disagrees with."
"8535410","8539810"," Let's watch this writer kind of on the see this right here."
"8539930","8541770"," This is kind of a big rug pull moment, right?"
"8542510","8544030"," Watch this on book map right here. "
"8544170","8547590"," Just kind of like park there and they're looking for that blood, right?"
"8547870","8548090"," Look at that."
"8548230","8550290"," Look at these buyers down here."
"8551330","8553890"," So it's kind of kind of getting freaked out by it, right?"
"8554090","8556890"," So you got this demand down below here. "
"8557190","8560070"," We're going to pull this rug and have a quick bloodbath to the downside."
"8560930","8562830"," Find out if these are real buyers or not."
"8562990","8564670"," This is kind of the support going back. "
"8565810","8568590"," It's pretty significantly in early June."
"8570310","8572710"," In the market, that's where these original buyers are."
"8572850","8574810"," But this isn't even a big band either, is it?"
"8575110","8576350"," Not too much of a band here. "
"8576850","8579030"," It's kind of like do or die here for spoos."
"8581330","8583270"," Three minutes left for bears to get a new low."
"8583510","8585050"," They didn't achieve it as of yet. "
"8585690","8587610"," So right up here you guys can see."
"8588430","8590310"," No new low in that half hour there."
"8591010","8592670"," No new low here so far. "
"8592910","8595310"," So we'll look to see if there's an upside half hour candle."
"8595970","8599350"," Let's see if the bulls will take over and start setting us much higher here."
"8599810","8602910"," If you're a seller, get out of the way in the next couple minutes. "
"8603150","8606630"," You got like five minutes left if you're a seller for that new low."
"8610430","8612030"," So we're talking about building these accounts."
"8612050","8614250"," We're like, okay, it's almost time to start building these things. "
"8615210","8617370"," And there's only a few ways to do it."
"8617670","8625350"," You can only like, you know, you post things that get a reaction, emotional reaction from people."
"8626410","8628070"," That can be good and bad. "
"8628570","8632250"," There's like the opposite side of the trade stuff."
"8632510","8634790"," Likely to slip below trend for a drawn out period."
"8635070","8636370"," Just a repeat of an earlier headline. "
"8637210","8639090"," And then of course there's all the Nazi shit."
"8640330","8643230"," Which will get you a hundred thousand followers in five minutes."
"8643870","8646730"," Of course I'm like, I'm like, we can't do this and we can't do that. "
"8646830","8648310"," We can't do this and we can't do that."
"8648930","8651130"," And the guy is like, I'm not that person."
"8651270","8652410"," I'm like, I'm not either. "
"8652570","8652850"," You're not."
"8653010","8653690"," We both aren't."
"8653950","8656830"," But we know exactly what gains followers. "
"8658230","8659590"," And it's kind of disgusting."
"8659750","8663750"," You kind of like selling yourself down the river to gain those followers."
"8670410","8672390"," Let's see what anybody doesn't want to hear, right?"
"8679770","8680770"," I'm going to say there. "
"8689170","8693750"," It says some peer on credit conditions for North America in the fourth quarter says that we expect"
"8693750","8697490"," the slowdown in China to have only a few direct effects on the US economy."
"8698130","8701170"," I saw the Moody's comments in the news too."
"8701630","8705230"," You got Moody's in the background trying to suck off a sell market. "
"8705230","8709070"," And I'm like, man, does anybody ever do an audit of fucking Moody's?"
"8709470","8712490"," Let's see if they're short this fucking market and S&P 500."
"8714830","8715950"," Come on, dude."
"8716410","8717630"," Fucking just do it. "
"8719430","8720790"," Squeeze these bucks out."
"8721070","8724410"," Squeeze every one of these last motherfuckers out right now."
"8725110","8727110"," Why the fuck are we sitting here?"
"8727410","8728770"," Squeeze these motherfuckers out. "
"8729510","8730110"," It's 12 o'clock."
"8730570","8731670"," They didn't get a new fucking low."
"8732530","8734790"," Get these fucking sellers out of here. "
"8736250","8736610"," Damn."
"8738070","8739370"," So much stupidity."
"8765610","8768070"," Sorry, I'm all shitty about this right now. "
"8774280","8775120"," Yeah, you don't."
"8775260","8776820"," I'm not going to be that guy either."
"8777440","8778480"," You can be. "
"8779500","8780780"," And that's how you do it."
"8781140","8784060"," So the question becomes how do you do it without doing that stuff?"
"8784760","8785900"," It's not pretty, right?"
"8786600","8788840"," When you want like when you're like, okay, I want to grow an account."
"8789340","8790460"," How do you get them to grow?"
"8791020","8794080"," There are some really shitty easy ways to do it. "
"8794380","8795880"," And I'm not willing to do that, of course."
"8799000","8804200"," Well, there's some really, really shitty, shitty, like the algorithms for Twitter."
"8805400","8806920"," So a close friend of ours. "
"8807220","8808380"," We got a close friend here."
"8809620","8811160"," Some of you know who he is."
"8812240","8815580"," Some of you don't, but a lot of you do know who he is who I'm talking about. "
"8820500","8827020"," And he's a very smart guy, like he's one of the smartest guys I know."
"8827600","8835920"," And he has been wielding the Twitter algorithms for a few years now."
"8835940","8837840"," And it's atrocious to see. "
"8839120","8844180"," The fastest way to grow your accounts is usually by being in a quite offensive."
"8845200","8845560"," I don't know."
"8845560","8848940"," The algorithms love the more offensive you are to people. "
"8851440","8853500"," There's like emotional stuff and that kind of stuff."
"8853700","8858940"," But on Twitter specifically, the more of a douche you are, well not douche."
"8859120","8860040"," I shouldn't say douche. "
"8860300","8862780"," That word is awful not to use that word."
"8863740","8868380"," The more that you anger people, let me rephrase that."
"8868540","8872000"," The more that you anger somebody, the more traction that you get. "
"8872960","8877400"," The more you inferior people, the more that you capture their failings."
"8878360","8879540"," It's kind of crazy, right?"
"8879800","8886520"," The entire algorithm process of Twitter is not the entire, but a lot of it is based upon your"
"8886520","8887000"," emotions."
"8888300","8892620"," In that wild, we all think that Twitter is normal and great and all that. "
"8892940","8899000"," But in reality, most of its algorithms are based around making sure that you're angry."
"8899720","8901380"," That you stay emotional on Twitter."
"8902260","8903720"," It's kind of wild to see. "
"8911920","8913420"," Got watching this right now."
"8916400","8920560"," 12.03 right here, a couple more minutes left, wait for that five minute bar to finish filling out."
"8922260","8927620"," You get HYST still parked down in 73.71, it's a little bit higher right now, but it's just sitting"
"8927620","8930020"," on that cusp on that edge. "
"8931240","8935960"," Looks like the market's looking for some kind of news to sell no mark, no news out there right now,"
"8935980","8936880"," but if we catch any."
"8937780","8942460"," I don't know what they're looking for here, but they're looking for some kind of news to sell this"
"8942460","8943080"," market down."
"8955540","8958280"," So I just said to my buddy, I was like, no Nazi shit. "
"8961360","8965380"," Of course he's not a Nazi, but we're talking about it."
"8969200","8970240"," Yeah, it's pretty brutal."
"8970560","8977700"," It's pretty brutal what you need to do to gain or what you can do to gain followers. "
"8978740","8986420"," And I'm talking like half a million million followers pretty wild to see what can or what the fast"
"8986420","8987560"," ways to get that are."
"8989120","8990880"," It's not and it's not being nice."
"8991240","8992380"," It's being nasty. "
"8998780","9000240"," Let's go to Bitcoin really quick."
"9001140","9002460"," Let's see if BTC is saying."
"9027640","9028700"," Hold on one second here. "
"9044950","9051290"," I mean, just look at, look at fucking Bitcoin, dude."
"9051530","9054910"," Bitcoin is like bearish as fuck."
"9056110","9059210"," Down below it's weekly, down below it's weekly, being told no, right?"
"9059630","9061130"," Let's look at Bitcoin really quick. "
"9064490","9067410"," So Bitcoin, man, not looking good, right?"
"9067710","9073130"," Any attempt to go higher than it's weekly, being told no, sell it down, no, sell it down."
"9074170","9075870"," And same thing here, right?"
"9076170","9077230"," Like down, down, down."
"9077490","9078790"," Where do they want it to go on Bitcoin?"
"9080190","9082410"," It's pretty fucking low, right?"
"9090810","9093450"," I'm trying to say that the way is down on Bitcoin here. "
"9094750","9097470"," Bitcoin bears below it's monthly trigger here."
"9098250","9100570"," And they're saying that it's lower, right?"
"9100750","9102690"," They're saying this isn't low enough back here."
"9103890","9106450"," That 20,000, 444 down here. "
"9106570","9107390"," This is back in September."
"9107890","9109730"," I'm saying they want to go back and revisit that."
"9110050","9111230"," I don't fucking know why. "
"9111350","9113350"," In all honesty, I don't know why I want to."
"9114650","9115870"," We've already down there."
"9118070","9120190"," So just watching this right now. "
"9120690","9125290"," There's buyers down in here looking to see if there's buyers down here."
"9125290","9130270"," So we'll keep an eye on Bitcoin here in the background, see if these buyers are still here or not."
"9131150","9133030"," They say they have, they want it, right?"
"9133470","9135970"," They bought it right back down here at 25,000. "
"9136750","9138750"," Parked right now at 26,000."
"9138890","9140210"," No reason not to buy it."
"9149540","9151160"," They want to see that. "
"9151320","9151620"," See that?"
"9151760","9152980"," That bar right here."
"9153040","9153700"," I want to show you this."
"9154420","9155380"," Keep your eye on this. "
"9155600","9158680"," Be very, like this is spy in a daily, right?"
"9159880","9161900"," Never like seeing this right here."
"9162020","9162300"," See this?"

"13683310","13685010"," weekly on spoos, right?"
"13685210","13691090"," This is HYG, but if you get the closing red bar, any spoos, and then you get the closing red"

"13698690","13700070"," you some damage coming."
"13700690","13708470"," It's showing you that if you get these closing bars, these closing half bar bars, that the easy way"

"13710810","13716170"," The easy way becomes way down, way down here for HYG and not to the upside."

"14363420","14369820"," All they got to do is pin this down and you're going to see that blood rain down into the"
"14369820","14370980"," 29th of September."
"14371820","14375160"," No demand to buy here, right?"
"14375780","14377760"," Zero demand to buy here into tomorrow."
"14377760","14382500"," You see this bottom here at 42820, but it means nothing, right?"
"14383260","14384620"," There's no demand here. "
"14384720","14385500"," Think about that, right?"
"14385760","14392360"," Think about the fact that you've got no buyers with force right now buying this and taking this"
"14392360","14393020"," higher, right?"
"14393560","14400240"," Seeing that and that weakness that's going on currently on SPOs lends the idea to just let this"
"14400240","14403880"," sell off into the 29th, right?"
"14403880","14410660"," It's like a fucking magnet down there, this JPM collar down here, just a giant fucking magnet."
"14411760","14417940"," And you get that closing bar in HYG, you get that closing bar on SPOs into the end of today."
"14418880","14421560"," And this does not bode well for bulls. "
"14422100","14427160"," I'm thinking that we could go up here, close all that up and then come back down, but as time"
"14427160","14432180"," passes, the day passes along, it's not looking good for bulls here."
"14432180","14435460"," Not looking good in any way, shape or form."
"14436040","14442720"," So just into the 29th expectation, JPM collar 4210 to the downside. "
"14443800","14449900"," And bears winning right now and today, no demand by buyers here."
"14450360","14452640"," Watch this, this bottom right here."
"14453260","14456260"," This SPX is where the demand is, known demand. "
"14457220","14459320"," And these, they're not buying it up here, are they?"
"14459320","14461020"," They said, fuck you, ain't buying that."
"14461500","14466300"," And so we're going to come back down and check this and likely roll to the downside."
"14467500","14469420"," I don't think bulls have it here, right?"
"14470320","14475520"," If they're not buying it up here, the bulls aren't buying it right here to take it higher. "
"14476400","14478040"," Then they ain't buying this shit either."
"14478040","14480160"," We're going back down to test it right now."
"14480640","14484140"," You can probably see it on SPY at the moment. "
"14484360","14486380"," I'm going to get stopped out here in just a moment."
"14487620","14491740"," No demand by bulls on SPX."
"14492300","14494840"," No demand by bulls on spoos. "
"14495220","14496800"," You can see it right here."
"14498240","14500220"," They're going to give this thing up, man."
"14500620","14501180"," Fuck in. "
"14501340","14501780"," Hey, baby."
"14502140","14505600"," Unreal right now."
"14506340","14508380"," Let's watch it on spoos really quick. "
"14509220","14510380"," Let's watch it on SPY."
"14511440","14512520"," I'm about to get stopped out here."
"14514640","14515780"," Look at that. "
"14516240","14522260"," No dice by bulls coming back down here to test that prior low."
"14523020","14524480"," You can see it right here."
"14526020","14527860"," And they are not going to get it. "
"14527920","14529280"," It's going to go all the way down here."
"14529420","14535400"," It's going to go all the way down here to S3 to 426.34. I got stopped out."
"14535480","14536180"," I'm way out now. "
"14536660","14537860"," I am no longer calls."
"14538040","14542420"," I got stopped out 10 minutes higher or 10 pennies."
"14543560","14544880"," I'm flat right now. "
"14545820","14548240"," So I got stopped out way up here somewhere."
"14548440","14552080"," 500 is extending drop down once about 4% now."
"14552500","14555140"," S3 getting tagged right now on spoos. "
"14558970","14563730"," 426.34.37. No calls for me."
"14564070","14567230"," I was out up here at 30 fucking five cents or something, 30 cents."
"14567890","14571230"," Took me right the fuck out like nobody's business up here in that candle. "
"14573250","14575130"," Straight fucking bloodbath."
"14576050","14578190"," Like a magnet to the downside."
"14578850","14579250"," No wait. "
"14579810","14581330"," Fuck end of the day."
"14581930","14583810"," It just said fuck you."
"14584330","14585490"," There's S3. "
"14586510","14589070"," Big tag on S3 to the pin strike."
"14589570","14590570"," And I'll be honest, man."
"14591090","14592510"," Looking at that SPX chart. "
"14593850","14598610"," No, no will of buyers right here to follow through."
"14598610","14601550"," And I was actually up on these calls significantly."
"14602070","14605670"," I was up 30, 40, maybe even 50% at one point. "
"14606150","14606870"," Didn't matter."
"14607190","14608750"," Sold it straight down to the depths of hell."
"14609250","14610330"," Tagging S3. "
"14610890","14614430"," And to be honest, not looking good for bulls here."
"14614950","14616130"," No bueno."
"14617090","14618830"," The time period. "
"14619930","14621950"," Time not on the side of bulls."
"14624010","14625770"," 420 on tap for bulls here."
"14626170","14627550"," 420 on tap. "

"14751590","14753870"," Good bye bulls, baby. "
"14756510","14759410"," Bulls can suck balls on that one."
"14761910","14763730"," Even on that S3."
"14768220","14769380"," No buyers. "
"14772060","14774160"," Let's check SPX really quick."
"14775900","14777900"," Yeah, no fucking buyers at all."
"14779940","14795490"," I got"

"14816270","14818030"," Take all that right there. "
"14839210","14841090"," So we can get a little bit more blood here."

"15133560","15134780"," Price target to the downside. "
"15135540","15136100"," 421."
"15137560","15144840"," 3.2. 421.10. But also this 426033 should see a bump in it."

"15262160","15263480"," Too much of a break. "
"15263480","15266520"," I should see a bounce on 425, but it doesn't matter."
"15268660","15270280"," Bulls gave it up right here."
"15270580","15272840"," This was the one right here. "
"15272960","15275220"," Right there."
"15275360","15278040"," That was the one Bulls gave that up the moment they gave that up."

"15317090","15319410"," See where they're saying the bottom is here. "
"15320250","15321710"," Don't believe this bottom here."
"15321910","15323750"," Don't do not believe that one there."
"15323910","15326670"," You bounce there, but you're going to go way farther down. "
"15328110","15330550"," There is no demand here."
"15333770","15335030"," I'm actually up on puts."
"15351180","15354460"," H.Y.G. still fighting to recover, not that it matters. "

"15367340","15372420"," So not believing that recovery in H.Y.G. in any way shape or form."
"15376370","15378790"," Just another excuse to sell this market here."
"15383690","15385390"," Bad news for Bulls today. "
"15385970","15387010"," So just a heads up to you."
"15387090","15393350"," If you are a bull, you've got a loss of 7371 on H.Y "
"15393350","15400670",".G. to sell this market."
"15401270","15403470"," So they've got the end of the day red bar. "
"15403590","15407130"," So right now they've got the end of the day red bars on spy."
"15407730","15414250"," And they also have the clothes on H.Y.G. Unless bulls pull some kind of miracle out of their"
"15414250","15414710"," ass today."
"15415170","15419250"," I mean they can, but unless they pull some kind of a miracle out of their ass. "
"15419850","15428250"," You've got H.Y.G. will have a closing below 7371 watching it squeeze right now."
"15428250","15431030"," But you will see a closing below 7371."
"15431630","15435530"," And an expectation of a major downside move into the 29. "
"15436510","15440750"," As a matter of fact right here on this lower chart right here."
"15441210","15443310"," All those sellers that were up there."
"15443570","15448290"," They are now right here. "
"15449770","15452190"," So all those sellers are now right here."
"15453950","15457610"," And you've also got sellers that have moved down below."
"15464130","15465690"," Down below the weekly trigger. "
"15465930","15466670"," This is where they are."
"15469090","15473130"," So if you can see that there all these sellers down here in weekly trigger."
"15473610","15477650"," And all these sellers are just looking to sell this shit to the depths of hell. "
"15477910","15484750"," And to further that point you've got you now have a plane of resistance below an S2."
"15486830","15490730"," So you now have S2 acting as major resistance to the downside."
"15495160","15496900"," All extremely bearish here. "
"15497120","15498380"," All extremely bearish."
"15517160","15519100"," Yeah I got some protective puts here."
"15519840","15520400"," 100%. "
"15520400","15521620"," Garen fucking teed."

"15541780","15542500"," I don't have a choice. "
"15543620","15545140"," Those stay on until Friday."
"15545480","15546320"," As far as I'm concerned."
"15547320","15547960"," They got it. "

"15558240","15560820"," And so they're just waiting for that down move into Friday."
"15575650","15577410"," Now you don't get the bare music till you hit 420. "
"15578270","15579730"," I'll give you the bare music if we hit 420."
"15581310","15584490"," And there's actually we can actually go lower than 420."

"20938930","20943770"," And you've got a market and an economy that says there ain't no fucking way that's happening."
"20944430","20946470"," There ain't no fucking way."
"20947210","20956410"," Not only that if you were to stay on that course regardless of where the market is. "
"20956930","20964410"," You are going to see destruction of our economy and destruction of the stock market."

"20979710","20984090"," I assure you that you will not have a soft landing."
"20984570","20987110"," You will not have a mild recession."
"20988070","20992630"," If this is if the fed continues to hike in a 20 in a December of twenty four. "
"20993890","21000690"," You will you will see the fed actually get pushed to task and they will be back pedaling."
"21000690","21004390"," And cutting rates as we go into that time period."

"21017890","21021330"," If he thinks he's going to do that and everything's going to be hockey dory and then we're going to"
"21021330","21026150"," get a soft landing or any of that other fucking nonsense that he's talking about."
"21027390","21032570"," Absolutely not that that that fed meeting was a fucking disaster. "
"21033630","21036530"," A straight pure fucking disaster."
"21037010","21042330"," He oversold something that he did not need to over sell."
"21042730","21047590"," He should have come in and said he or he needed to I think the intent was. "
"21048110","21050310"," I have to over sell it right."
"21050550","21053630"," I think he came into that fed meeting and he was like over sell this."
"21053630","21056950"," I got to like if I don't they're not going to believe me right. "
"21057210","21061210"," If I tell him hire for longer so I'm going to come out there and he went full."
"21063050","21066070"," Regards he's got no business showing us charts."
"21066490","21068450"," It's got no business doing that shit. "
"21068910","21073190"," So the moment that he's doing that he's trying to tell people trying to tell the market."
"21073470","21077390"," I'm going higher for longer and fuck you and I'm going to give you a date on it."
"21077630","21081550"," And I'm going to base this on a three year out or a four year out he's looking at like"
"21081550","21083030"," twenty thirty charts. "
"21083630","21087210"," For the year twenty thirty and we own that we all know that that shit."

"21088910","21089790"," It's it's worthless. "
"21090030","21091630"," You can wipe your ass with that."
"21092190","21093710"," Any of those charts from anybody."
"21093710","21095530"," I don't care if you're a bull bear or whatever. "
"21096130","21101550"," And he has no need to be selling that to the market or participants."
"21102110","21103770"," In any way shape or form."
"21103790","21107810"," So it's kind of like someone had said it and streamed that day. "
"21108210","21109230"," It's kind of like when."
"21110990","21117330"," Someone said my father used to say that if you say it's going here and you don't defend yourself."
"21118310","21119450"," You're probably right. "
"21119590","21125070"," If you're out there with a bunch of shit like ten different reasons why the market should be fine."
"21125550","21126970"," Something is fucking wrong."
"21127790","21129410"," You don't need to sell this. "
"21129570","21132690"," You need to sell that to market participants as the Fed Chair."
"21133390","21135430"," In the moment that he did that it triggered a war."
"21135750","21137310"," It triggered a we don't believe you. "
"21138250","21142310"," You know so if they're against him and don't believe him that one way or another."
"21142650","21144370"," They'll just fucking force him."
"21144430","21145510"," I'll be honest like point blank. "
"21145690","21147030"," They'll fucking force him to cut."
"21147530","21149430"," That's how this goes."
"21150030","21152150"," So he oversold himself. "
"21152610","21154050"," Now whatever he does and comes out."
"21154450","21157230"," The bullshit with Kosh Kari today trying to say."
"21157730","21160290"," Kosh Kari today is trying to spin. "
"21160810","21162170"," He's testing the waters."
"21162610","21163830"," Let me read exactly what was said."
"21163830","21166670"," This is complete and utter fucking nonsense. "
"21168070","21171350"," Utter fucking nonsense coming out of cash."
"21171610","21174950"," Kosh Kari right can suck my fucking balls."
"21175550","21181690"," Came out today and he said I put a 40% probability on a scenario where the Fed will have"
"21181690","21187570"," to raise rates significantly higher to beat inflation and I put a 60% probability on a soft"
"21187570","21188030"," landing. "
"21188030","21190570"," So they're trying to test this dog shit."
"21191030","21193990"," Into the rest of this week right test the waters."
"21194590","21197290"," Like okay how about how about we meet in the middle. "
"21197630","21200650"," And there is no fucking meeting in the middle on this."
"21201110","21203210"," I've lived through this too many fucking times."
"21203630","21207850"," To hear this bullshit from the Fed like oh yeah like we're going to meet in the fucking middle. "
"21208510","21209950"," Get sucked my balls."
"21210370","21212790"," You keep doing that shit till you do that."
"21213530","21218790"," I don't even believe that you can stay in that path into December of 2024. "
"21219470","21221990"," You're going to see you're going to guarantee it."
"21222390","21225650"," You're going to between now and 2024 right you're going to see fucking."
"21225910","21228710"," You're going to see people running down the street with their hair on fire. "
"21228910","21233930"," Whether that's like a part of what they want to do not disagreement with that."
"21233930","21235470"," I want to see that happen."
"21236290","21238790"," But they're both face lying to you is my point. "
"21238790","21243050"," They're both face telling you digging their heels in right now."
"21243370","21247150"," Telling you that they're going to be fucking doing this shit in 2024 in December."
"21247210","21251650"," And you're saying that you're going to see Senate top cap bill and avoid a shutdown. "
"21252770","21257550"," They do that shit into December 2024 and you're going to see people running on the street."
"21258350","21260290"," You know it's like it's like yelling."
"21260750","21262070"," We saved the housing market. "
"21262310","21263010"," You know the housing crash."
"21263830","21267050"," I think Yellen was the president of the San Francisco Fed."
"21267050","21267890"," I could be wrong on that. "
"21268010","21268690"," But I think she was."
"21269210","21271730"," And she said some stupid ass shit like."
"21272410","21273230"," Oh, thank God. "
"21273510","21275770"," Even though the markets burn into the ground right now."

"21279290","21280410"," Two weeks later."
"21281070","21284310"," The fucking market went to the depths of fucking hell."
"21285170","21287670"," People everybody in the United States lost their homes. "

"21414310","21417030"," Jerome Powell is going to be telling you."
"21417210","21417970"," There ain't no way there. "
"21418310","21419450"," There ain't no not happening."
"21420410","21422090"," I'm talking to friends right now."
"21422290","21424070"," They're I got friends out there right now. "
"21424170","21424490"," They're like."
"21424990","21427010"," We doing shit."
"21427010","21429910"," These are people that own large companies. "
"21430270","21431430"," They're like we ain't doing nothing."
"21432030","21434170"," So I don't think you see this."
"21434510","21437330"," I don't think you like I'm trying to like think to myself. "
"21437650","21439590"," You're telling me that Jerome is going to be."
"21440130","21443490"," Raising rates into 2025."
"21444130","21447070"," Point blank said December 2024 right. "
"21447510","21450090"," It's going to wake up on January of 2025."
"21450750","21456610"," And this fucking guy is going to go into that spring of 2025 with rates being that high."
"21456610","21458210"," I doubt it man. "
"21458490","21459910"," If you if you think so."
"21460270","21463830"," And you should be buying this dip right here because the market should continue higher."
"21464270","21468130"," If they think that he's fighting inflation into 2025 is Superman. "
"21468750","21469590"," Dude I'll eat."
"21469730","21471790"," I'll eat a fucking sock on air."
"21472030","21476330"," If the old fucking chop a sock up in the little pieces and I will shove that shit down my"
"21476330","21477270"," throat in front of you. "
"21477450","21483110"," If you think that you think that guy's going to be raising rates and or like peak rates in January"
"21483110","21483930"," of 2025."
"21483930","21489330"," We're going to roll into a rate decision in March of 2025."
"21489690","21493710"," He's going to tell you then that he's pausing because that's what it implies right. "
"21494170","21498250"," You're implying that rate hikes into December of 2025."
"21498610","21503830"," Four and then this guy is going to start making decisions if he's going to go higher or lower."
"21504330","21505790"," No fucking way. "
"21510130","21510790"," I'll eat it."
"21510890","21511170"," I'll eat it."
"21511250","21511650"," I'll eat a god damn sock. "
"21511850","21513630"," I promise you I'll eat a sock on air."
"21514030","21521050"," If that guy thinks he's going to be pausing in spring of 2025 and then maybe making a decision to"
"21521050","21522790"," cut rates in the year 2025."
"21523390","21524730"," He's out of his fucking mind. "
"21528890","21533650"," He's out of his fucking mind and they're calling him on it right now."
"21533650","21534710"," They're like what is he doing?"
"21534710","21535830"," He didn't have to do that."
"21537070","21540690"," But he's that's what he's saying and I say no way. "
"21540830","21541850"," I say there's no way."
"21542110","21547430"," There's no way that is going to start pausing in 2025 and then I don't know raise more rates in"
"21547430","21551110"," a 2026 or even start cutting in a 2026."
"21551850","21552730"," She ain't happening. "
"21553350","21554490"," This is out of his mind."
"21558610","21559490"," No socks."
"21560110","21560850"," Hell no. "
"21561350","21562550"," You think you're out of your minds."
"21563610","21570990"," Yeah, no, I was there."
"21571130","21571650"," I'm old man. "
"21571830","21572490"," I know I look young."
"21572710","21573650"," I'm not that fucking young."
"21573870","21574990"," I remember how that shit went. "
"21575530","21581010"," Yeah, you might have been somewhere where that wasn't going on, but where there was where there was"
"21581010","21581330"," money."
"21582270","21583550"," That housing crash."
"21584570","21587510"," Even if you held on so let's say you did the right thing. "
"21588010","21590790"," You're like, I did the right thing during the housing crash."
"21590790","21591110"," Right?"
"21591230","21592030"," The big one, right?"
"21592210","21592770"," The monster one?"
"21593970","21595470"," That's not how it played out."
"21595910","21603070"," People were left way way upside down and then their neighborhoods were destroyed. "
"21603810","21604430"," That's what it was."
"21604630","21605190"," I remember it."
"21605550","21606570"," I remember what it happened. "
"21606810","21608130"," It was it was fucking wild."
"21609290","21611670"," And there ain't no way this is happening like this."
"21611830","21615310"," If this this guy thinks is that you're talking about a guy here, right?"
"21615650","21616830"," That's just serious fucking question. "
"21617850","21620010"," Yeah, it's just a serious fucking question out there."
"21620430","21621610"," Let me tell you something."
"21621910","21622590"," Okay, you should know. "
"21623910","21628030"," When some guy like a Fed president shows you a chart from 2030."
"21629830","21635150"," That guy is telling you that there is nothing bad that's going to happen between now and then."
"21635750","21637490"," We're in 20 fucking 23. "
"21637930","21639270"," We're in 2023."
"21639270","21644170"," And this guy was showing charts to 2032, yes, or last week."
"21644710","21648610"," And you're telling me that that guy right there knows what's going to happen between now and 2030?"
"21649150","21650570"," No fucking way. "
"21650770","21651430"," He's out of his mind."
"21653570","21655590"," He is straight out of his mind, man."
"21655890","21656490"," Straight out of his mind. "
"21656770","21657090"," Telling him."
"21657550","21659030"," Guy is out of his fucking skull."
"21660730","21661970"," Oh, you can fight the Fed. "
"21662330","21662970"," Fed has been wrong."
"21663310","21666470"," And it's usually at the end of a tightening cycle when they're wrong."
"21666470","21668210"," They are usually wrong. "
"21668550","21671590"," When you say that don't fight the Fed works until you get to the end of it."
"21671830","21677170"," Once you get to the end of it, you're like, eh, no, man, too much, too much."
"21677250","21677850"," Don't do that. "
"21679330","21681370"," You're like too much, dude."
"21685330","21689810"," I'm telling you, like the Fed, like the don't fight the Fed is true."
"21690510","21692290"," Like the don't fight the Fed is true. "
"21692770","21693990"," But there comes a moment."
"21694530","21695050"," Right?"
"21695210","21696530"," I'm down with going with the Fed."
"21696730","21699190"," But there comes a moment where you go, eh, I don't know, man. "
"21699590","21703270"," Like, let me explain it better to you."
"21705530","21712070"," The Fed could raise rates into December 2025 if they didn't say that shit."
"21713170","21714990"," That was a high probability. "
"21716670","21721330"," It's it's it's it's not that he can't raise rates in December 2025."
"21722830","21725510"," It's how he goes about saying that they're going to do it."
"21726950","21728730"," It's projecting that far out. "
"21728910","21729590"," Hey, we're going to do this."
"21729590","21730230"," And we're going to do that."
"21730290","21730770"," We're going to do this. "
"21730770","21731630"," And that's what's going to happen."
"21731890","21733830"," And it's like, ah, you didn't have to do that."
"21734170","21739330"," Could have just set higher for longer monitor inflation, monitor unemployment. "
"21740190","21746550"," If you look at a chart for unemployment, we should be fucking at like five to six percent"
"21746550","21748750"," unemployment at that point."
"21750290","21755570"," Historically, if we're at that five or six percent unemployment, the market should be on fucking"
"21755570","21756090"," fire."
"21756510","21760230"," It should be going to the depths of hell at that point. "
"21761110","21766530"," So if the market's going to the depths of hell and unemployment is raging, you're not expecting the"
"21766530","21767770"," Fed to be raising shit."
"21768270","21770290"," They ain't raising shit as we do that."
"21770810","21772430"," That should not happen. "
"21772430","21778850"," Has not ever happened ever, ever, ever, not one time has that ever happened."
"21788440","21789280"," They did it."
"21789500","21791520"," You can go back and listen to that fed meeting. "
"21791900","21793520"," You can go back and listen to that fed me."
"21793620","21796920"," They were going to raise and hold into December 2024."
"21798660","21799620"," December 2024. "
"21801280","21803060"," Go back and watch that fed me."
"21803820","21804840"," I watched it."
"21805100","21806040"," I read the transcripts. "
"21806420","21807100"," I read everything."
"21814850","21816070"," You got to go back."
"21816330","21818050"," I already went back and did my research. "
"21818390","21819990"," I watched it live here."
"21820370","21821650"," I went back and read the transcripts."
"21822390","21823270"," Go do it on your own. "
"21823770","21825050"," He's out of his fucking mind."
"21825450","21826330"," I'm going to tell you something."
"21826510","21829370"," What was the last time you saw anyone?"
"21830510","21835070"," You think a Fed chair is going to pull out charts for you for no reason?"
"21835070","21841550"," Do you think that they go to a meeting before they get there and say, do we do charts or"
"21841550","21843550"," not for no motivation?"
"21844250","21847430"," It's over selling that we're going to be higher for longer. "
"21847950","21851290"," I don't think that they are, but they're trying to sell it."
"21851990","21855530"," We have to sell this into December 2024."
"21856690","21858690"," That's how long we're going to be higher for. "
"21858990","21861890"," It was too much selling of that thought process."
"21864190","21865130"," Too much selling."
"21865330","21865810"," Too much selling. "
"21866110","21867950"," Too much sizzle on the state."
"21869670","21871390"," Too much sizzle on the state."
"21873150","21876430"," If that isn't true, you can even see what Kashkari did today. "
"21877290","21878830"," It's like trying to like, oh shit."
"21878950","21879530"," We oversold it."
"21879630","21881610"," We're going to try to pull it back a little bit, rein it back a little bit. "
"21886360","21886760"," Yeah."
"21887020","21887860"," The iPad, dude."
"21888200","21889040"," The fucking iPad. "
"21891360","21892680"," It was the iPad."
"21893880","21897860"," You're talking about the fucking leader of the Fed Reserve."
"21899020","21903080"," He doesn't have to say shit where he doesn't have to show shit. "
"21903200","21905880"," He just speaks and you listen to him."
"21905920","21906220"," Do you understand?"
"21906640","21909760"," When he speaks, you listen to him, right?"
"21909920","21913180"," But then when they started it, when they started all that stuff, I was like, these guys have no"
"21913180","21914040"," idea what's going to happen."
"21914280","21915120"," You're looking again. "
"21915240","21916320"," That's something that's on Facebook."
"21916320","21916540"," That's on Facebook."
"21916540","21916560"," That's on Facebook. "
"21917080","21917460"," That's on Facebook."
"21917620","21918160"," That's on Facebook."
"21920580","21921680"," That's on Facebook. "
"21922400","21923800"," Pulling out like the path."
"21926520","21928740"," I thought it was hilarious."
"21929860","21931160"," Bleeding down into the close here. "
"21931600","21939220"," Trading 425.02. Bleeding down into the close here."
"21939400","21941140"," HYG trying to hold on right now."
"21941680","21944080"," HYG setting up some kind of reversal to the upside. "
"21946160","21948740"," Just looking for another opportunity to get in and sell."
"21948740","21953160"," I want to sell that S2 up here."
"21953240","21955720"," That's the right where this S2 is if you watch my cursor. "
"21956600","21958780"," Any of this stuff right here trying to sell that."
"21959040","21959260"," Whoop."
"21960020","21960860"," Into the downside. "
"21964240","21965820"," Yeah, I don't see that."
"21965940","21967200"," I see the market selling."
"21968540","21971920"," I see the or not selling, but I see the market. "
"21972680","21973420"," Not the market."
"21973580","21974300"," I see the economy."
"21975640","21978800"," Should be in pretty shitty shape by. "
"21980180","21982000"," Spring summer of 2024."
"21983300","21984000"," Somewhere in there."
"21984100","21987620"," They're doing good work and you should see destruction. "
"21988300","21989520"," You should see job destruction."
"21989580","21991960"," You should see that stuff as we head into 2024."
"21992800","21994700"," At some point in spring, summer time. "
"21994960","21996560"," By the time we get into 2025."
"21997480","21998380"," It should be pretty."
"21998860","21999660"," We should be on fire. "
"21999840","22001200"," The economy should be on fire."
"22002880","22005260"," So if you look at it from that perspective."
"22006620","22010920"," You're talking about the Fed raising into that and then holding into that. "
"22011260","22012360"," Normally we get that."
"22012620","22017420"," Normally you get that front running of pause and cut before we get to the market rolling."
"22018020","22020120"," Rolling down and over. "
"22020920","22023200"," So if you can't get them to do that, right?"
"22023520","22025180"," Like if you can't get the fed to."
"22025920","22027740"," In some way, I agree to that."
"22028460","22031080"," The market will force it on to the fed, right?"
"22031080","22032800"," The market will sell on its own. "
"22033460","22036580"," And force the fed into cutting rates, right?"
"22036840","22037960"," Do you understand what I'm saying with that?"
"22038080","22039160"," Do you guys what look at it?"
"22040480","22044000"," The charts that he was showing you are the same ones that I show you here."
"22045400","22045840"," Right?"
"22046120","22050240"," So you're like, I show you those charts on the rate of inflation, the unemployment rate."
"22051200","22053460"," On the fed, the fed funds rate. "
"22053860","22056120"," And if you're seeing that fed funds rate being threatened."
"22057140","22059520"," Much, much higher than the expectation."
"22059520","22066120"," And it doesn't really match up with the rate of inflation, with the rate of unemployment, with the"
"22066120","22069680"," jobs numbers, with GDP, any of that kind of stuff. "
"22069880","22072740"," It makes it makes you wonder you're like, uh, are they do it?"
"22072980","22073880"," Do they really believe this?"
"22074180","22080820"," Or are they just trying to sell that notion that they're going to raise and hold higher for longer?"
"22081780","22087940"," And I think that the markets not think, but the market right now is saying to them, we don't think"
"22087940","22092400"," you're going to actually be raising rates or even holding rates after you're done with a rate"
"22092400","22092940"," cycle."
"22093200","22093840"," Let's see."
"22093920","22095120"," Put on another 50 BPS. "
"22095500","22100700"," You're going to hold them that deep into 2024, December, January of 2025."
"22101480","22106200"," There'll be no need to hold or raise that that long into the future."
"22116700","22117600"," Yeah, they're bad. "
"22117720","22118680"," They're betting against it."
"22118780","22120260"," I know that they're betting against it."
"22120340","22123480"," I realize I realize that they're betting against it right now. "
"22124540","22126900"," I realize that they're betting against this right now."
"22126960","22133140"," I don't see them raising rates 50 BPS and I don't see them holding them into December 2024."
"22133140","22136160"," It was the commentary from the Fed Chair. "
"22136640","22138060"," Please do yourself a favor."
"22138600","22141000"," Go back and watch that Fed commentary."
"22143320","22147120"," Do yourself a solid and see them trying to sell that narrative. "
"22148340","22154960"," Squeezing higher right now on Spy, trying to maintain 424 81."
"22159620","22165000"," Yeah, you guys need to go back and you guys need to separate a whole bunch of shit here."
"22165620","22165920"," Right?"
"22166320","22173060"," You're arguing like you're arguing a bunch of different points that do not mean anything to each"
"22173060","22173240"," other. "
"22173240","22174440"," They're all separate points."
"22175420","22183360"," I'm talking to you about the Fed fucking Jerome Powell trying to sell the narrative that he is"
"22183360","22186560"," going to raise 25 to 50 BPS."
"22186960","22192560"," He's going to hold that into 2024, December of 2024. "
"22193300","22195820"," And that is just not true in my view."
"22196140","22197080"," That does not happen."
"22197080","22199840"," I don't see them doing that into that time. "
"22200020","22204180"," And furthermore, you can even see the market betting against that right now."
"22204720","22206240"," That that is going to be the case."
"22206840","22213760"," They will be backpedaling when we come into December of 2024, which is January of 2025. "
"22216730","22218450"," You guys understand what I'm saying to you?"
"22219190","22224250"," I don't think you got like, so there's a disagreement here between what the Fed is saying they're"
"22224250","22224890"," going to do."
"22224890","22228350"," And what the market is saying is going to happen."
"22228770","22233510"," So if that is if the market's saying to you that something else is going to happen, right?"
"22234390","22239270"," And they're trying to buy themselves time from that role that pause and rolling of rates. "
"22239610","22243930"," So all they had to say was, yeah, we're going to keep raising and data dependent, right?"
"22244710","22249990"," They can keep pushing that narrative into the end of the year into springtime and into summer."
"22250770","22255550"," But when they're saying to you, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's we're we're doing this for like"
"22255550","22257090"," another year and a half, bro, bro."
"22257150","22262710"," So if we're doing it for like 15 more months, they're asking you to believe that it's not just"
"22262710","22268170"," fall, winter, and spring, or even summer, they're saying, fuck it, throw another six months on"
"22268170","22268410"," there. "
"22268670","22269930"," And you're like, you didn't have to do that, dude."
"22269990","22273990"," You'd have to sell it for an extra six fucking months through summer of 2024."
"22274090","22275710"," You just have to say higher for longer. "
"22276110","22277070"," It's that fucking simple."
"22278030","22278830"," Does that make sense?"
"22278830","22280390"," Oh, maybe it does or doesn't."
"22280450","22280770"," I don't know. "
"22285890","22291070"," So maybe you understand what I'm saying there or not, but so I think the markets calling bullshit"
"22291070","22294030"," on them and saying, fuck you, man, you're out of your fucking mind."
"22296370","22297710"," There's no fucking way."
"22297710","22307490"," Okay, so it's three forty six in the afternoon. "
"22307650","22308690"," We got 14 minutes left."
"22309550","22311650"," If you want to, we'll go back real quick."
"22311790","22313310"," The last 15 minutes here and just take a look. "
"22315690","22319610"," You've got on the upside target."
"22321990","22329450"," On the upside, bulls want to attempt to close this gap up here, get above the hourly, the daily,"
"22330090","22332050"," and the half hour right here."
"22332970","22334730"," What the bulls trying to do, squeeze it up. "
"22336270","22339250"," Sellers trying to step in on the overnight or morning."
"22340870","22344210"," I'm going to sell this dog shit down to the depths of hell."
"22344490","22348910"," I can assure you right now, if you just looked at that SPX chart, there ain't shit holding up the"
"22348910","22349310"," market here. "
"22349310","22353550"," So any kind of squeeze, you're going to treat as fake, right?"
"22353730","22354410"," Just fake squeezing."
"22356410","22359650"," You're talking about one person holding up the entire market right here."
"22360590","22365550"," Just looking for a place right now to sell this, sell this market down into a more reasonable"
"22365550","22366310"," price. "
"22366990","22375470"," Targets to the downside of Friday include four twenty eighty seven right down here and then four"
"22375470","22379850"," sixteen eighty four into Friday."
"22379850","22389230"," If you are a bull and you are looking for a reversal, you need to see price above four twenty"
"22389230","22390970"," nine eighty seven."
"22391970","22399050"," This number will move down as time passes, but not quicker, not quick enough for you. "
"22399070","22403450"," It's going to be another week or two until that weekly trigger moves back down a little bit more."
"22403630","22409650"," So otherwise, you're just looking for a place to sell bulls not in control of this market right"
"22409650","22409970"," now."
"22410590","22417030"," Fake bottom on spy right here and the real bottom is down at somewhere around four sixteenish. "
"22417310","22419310"," This is the real bottom down below here."
"22419590","22422650"," Real demand, we know demand down here."
"22423390","22428510"," So we're known demand is all these guys up here that were buying, they were like nope. "
"22429130","22433130"," Not unless we got back up here and we want to put some risk on makes sense to me."
"22433130","22437270"," Unless we get above this four thirty nine four thirty."
"22437690","22442450"," We are sellers still into the end of quarter here. "
"22442950","22445390"," Still sellers in the end of quarter."
"22464280","22469220"," Yeah, I think you need I think you need like if you need the market to rally or you want"
"22469220","22469540"," the market."
"22469540","22476580"," Like if I want the market to rally and I want the market to continue higher for longer, you just"
"22476580","22484840"," the market just needs to see all the market needs to see is that the Fed is doing its job. "
"22485460","22486860"," Does that make sense to you?"
"22487180","22494160"," So as long as the as long as the market believes that the Fed is doing its job, right?"
"22494920","22497820"," The market can go higher."
"22498580","22503340"," It just needs to believe that the Fed is doing its job."
"22503900","22510320"," When the market doesn't not like when the Fed is not just doing its job but is actually becoming"
"22510320","22510900"," activist. "
"22511900","22516620"," There's like when you see that that Jerome meeting right was not good."
"22517720","22523280"," They did not need to to say any of that other shit show any of the dot plots didn't need"
"22523280","22527760"," to show PCE didn't need to show unemployment rates."
"22527760","22530580"," Any of that kind of nonsense did not need to show it. "
"22530900","22540140"," So they're over selling their the Fed is over selling their position on what they're going to do to"
"22540140","22540640"," the market."
"22540640","22542740"," They just need all they need to say was higher for longer."
"22543100","22544920"," They had just said that that had been fine. "
"22546300","22548200"," And now you don't have the Fed doing that."
"22548420","22550120"," So you need the Fed."
"22550660","22556680"," Jerome Powell needs to come out and be like he needs to come out and be like, you know, you've"
"22556680","22560400"," over reacted to what I was saying or maybe you misinterpreted what I was saying. "
"22560400","22566820"," So I'll be paying attention very closely to see if he can step up and try to talk the market"
"22566820","22567240"," down."
"22568660","22571880"," Or at least make some kind of like concession or something."
"22572520","22575820"," And he sent cash carry out there today already trying to do damage control. "
"22576460","22579380"," We'll see if he can continue on with that damage control if he can he can."
"22579760","22581300"," But I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it."
"22581440","22583580"," I'm not buying it in any way shape or form. "
"22593030","22594030"," Not buying it."
"22599210","22601030"," Yeah, I don't believe the Fed."
"22601190","22602990"," I think the Fed are whores, man. "
"22603170","22607410"," I don't like I do believe the Fed, but then I don't believe the Fed."
"22619680","22622020"," Yeah, and they're asking for calls for tomorrow."
"22622120","22627060"," They're asking for four twenty eight eighty fucking cents, dude. "
"22629320","22632600"," 80 cents for four twenty eights for tomorrow."
"22633220","22634340"," That's fucking insane."
"22634740","22635500"," Oh, insane. "
"22635940","22642100"," Oh, let's start with a small position."
"22642180","22642700"," Hold on."
"22648710","22650890"," Long four twenty eight C for tomorrow. "
"22651530","22656230"," There's only only ten contracts for tomorrow expiry September 27th."
"22656850","22658490"," We'll see if we can get it here tomorrow."
"22658510","22661990"," But even this squeeze right here. "
"22661990","22662690"," Like this squeeze."
"22662850","22664470"," Remember the squeeze is into this close?"
"22665170","22666570"," This shit's gonna get sold."
"22671070","22675710"," So I got some contracts for tomorrow, but still looking debt to sell down into the weekend. "
"22676370","22677930"," Yeah, I don't believe the Fed, man."
"22678150","22679010"," I ain't believe in it."
"22679190","22681050"," Like I can't believe the Fed is going to. "
"22682250","22684470"," I think it comes quicker than we see."
"22686270","22689490"," I think it's kind of a weird thing."
"22689630","22692510"," Whenever these things happen, it's like one day everything is fine. "
"22692990","22696470"," The next thing you see, it's like a bunch of for sale signs out in front."
"22697190","22700330"," You start to see all your friends get and fucking laid off and all this shit."
"22700450","22702350"," It's like a blink of an eye how fast it happens. "
"22704390","22707230"," You know, have you ever heard like the Fed overtightening?"
"22709310","22711070"," We're like right there right now."
"22711250","22712530"," Like are they going to over tighten or not?"
"22712710","22713530"," That's the question, right?"
"22713570","22714590"," Are they going to over tighten or not?"
"22715810","22721070"," And so the expectation here is unless the Fed talks it down, at least, unless Jerome Powell talks"
"22721070","22726790"," that talk down, they gave me the impression that they were down to over tighten."
"22727050","22728570"," So that's what they want to do. "
"22729130","22732330"," If we're going back to the old school Fed where they over tighten, they over loosen."
"22733070","22734550"," I'm going to make the fucking market go wild."
"22735090","22735750"," So be it. "
"22741630","22743130"," I'm in some calls right now."
"22743290","22744970"," So it depends where price is."
"22748990","22756250"," I'm looking for a rejection off of 427.49. So we're right here. "
"22756370","22757950"," I'm looking for this trade right here."
"22759570","22761190"," For that trade right there."
"22761830","22763390"," And then some kind of sell down. "
"22763390","22765550"," If I can hold these to 415, I will."
"22771560","22773560"," Yeah, they give me one penny right now."
"22773720","22775080"," I'm up one penny on this squeeze. "
"22778080","22779500"," One penny right now."
"22779820","22782880"," They got make me pay an 80 cents for fucking overnight zero dates."
"22785780","22787800"," These are 31 deltas too. "
"22788500","22789780"," They're out of their fucking minds."
"22791620","22794840"," Give me now I'm up two pennies, one penny, two pennies right now."
"22795980","22797440"," I'm going to hold these like 415. "
"22804670","22806350"," No, no, no, I can't sell this here."
"22806950","22807350"," You guys understand."
"22807910","22808990"," You guys don't fucking understand. "
"22809790","22811090"," I can't sell this close."
"22812470","22815890"," I got to sell like S2 with B and S2 for me to sell it."
"22816050","22817090"," We're not going to do that cashmark. "
"22817110","22819390"," I'm going to run this shit up and then sell it."
"22819390","22821470"," Well, either the overnight or in cash market tomorrow."
"22841910","22848630"," Trading 78 cents right now and 80 cent calls even on that last little rip right there down two"
"22848630","22850010"," pennies now flat right now. "
"22851010","22852370"," Put this in a one minute here."
"22870630","22875950"," Trade 81 cents in 428 C's for 80 cents."
"22891470","22894530"," Trade 83 gave me three pennies right now on this. "
"22894770","22896070"," That was it three pennies."
"22906450","22915100"," Yeah, I got zero faith right now zero zero faith."
"22915120","22916960"," You need your room to come out and give you. "
"22917900","22922020"," If you're a bull, you need your if you're a bull, you need your own the command wheel that shit"
"22922020","22922320"," back."
"22923860","22927440"," It's the tone that fucking needs to tone that conversation down."
"22929000","22933600"," You need you must have your own you have to have your own tone back that shit. "
"22933860","22936040"," He's toned that tone down that conversation."
"22936900","22940660"," That wild ass shit that he's talking to that and that in that rate decision."
"22941080","22943920"," Cannot have him out there fucking wild ass in that shit. "
"22944560","22945440"," There ain't no way."
"22946500","22947860"," There ain't no way."
"22947960","22949160"," Just dial it back a little bit. "
"22954250","22961430"," Never enough like if you had like feel like a minor Fed President out there breaking out charts and"
"22961430","22962710"," dot plots and all that shit."
"22963010","22969730"," Be fine with that, but the Fed President has no business out there trying to show that shit trying"
"22969730","22970530"," to convince me."
"22971130","22978370"," That wasn't for me that was like these guys are doing out there is insane like no business doing"
"22978370","22979730"," that no business. "
"22982130","22984990"," Like if you want to send some other crony out there to do that."
"22985270","22988050"," You want to sell it send yelling out there to do something like that."
"22988830","22989490"," That's fine. "
"22989730","22990390"," You want to do that?"
"22990610","22990890"," That's fine."
"22991110","22993930"," The Fed Chair has no business out there doing that stuff."
"22994910","22998950"," I mean some some stinks and someone smells it, right?"
"22999210","22999450"," Someone's like. "
"23000750","23001710"," What is that?"
"23006170","23007510"," Trade in 83 right now."
"23016080","23017240"," You guys can hear me right?"
"23018040","23020540"," Somebody is saying you can't hear me?"

"23077190","23081790"," I want you to all know that I typically close calls or puts unless they're burning."
"23082770","23085450"," I close them on the opener renegotiate that trade. "
