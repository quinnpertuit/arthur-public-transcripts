"112560","118380"," Now, there's probably going to be some wonkiness going on this morning."
"118660","120940"," I tried to set everything up in the middle of the night last night."
"123240","128360"," And as a matter of fact, none of these numbers here are right, so bear with me at this point. "

"177180","180600"," But I am, my soul is slightly crushed at this point."
"182320","186700"," So let's start, but before we get too far into it, I'm going to small my camera looks over here."

"210720","215460"," Okay, so just for the moment at least, right, I'll make this small here in just a minute, but I"
"215460","216600"," don't want to fuck around with it too much. "
"219180","220580"," All right, this is good enough for now."

"270780","271780"," Same thing right here, okay. "

"597370","610550"," to, oh"
"610550","629100"," you got to be kidding me here, I have to be kidding me here, just"
"642670","659000"," a second here, alright boom we're good, rock and roll baby, that"
"659000","663880"," didn't take, that didn't take as long as I expected it to, alright so we're going to switch back"
"663880","676010"," over for you real quick here, and I apologize for the way that way everything looks here, let's"
"676010","686410"," see if that does a better job here, so"
"688940","696560"," what we're going to be get out my taskbar above, okay so I want you guys to have a real"
"696560","705980"," quick pick at this, okay, this is the spy right now, okay, and I want to show you"
"705980","715700"," what you oftentimes cannot see in the background when you're"
"715700","721760"," trading, okay, when you're like hey I want to buy a dip, something like that, I want to show you"
"721760","728560"," what's actually going on in the background, so if you look here you can see that when this is kind"
"728560","738360"," of wonky man, what is going on, please give me a, this is so bizarre,"
"739400","749060"," when those leavens like I'm not having anything to do with this, I'm gonna get a good color here"
"749060","758940"," for you, perfect, horrible, horrible, size baby, size, we need size here, we need"
"758940","768680"," some size, yeah that's not bad, okay, so what we're going to do is,"
"768880","775840"," what I want to show you is this, is that right in here you can see velocity is coming down"
"775840","780360"," in the market, momentum is coming down in the market here, we can't really see this in price right"
"780360","786980"," now, but I do want to show you that you see we're supported here in this hourly right trigger here"
"786980","795040"," and we lost the one minute and the five minute here this red line and traded underneath, okay, and"
"795040","799880"," so what bears are trying to do right now is trying to sell this market underneath your hourly you"
"799880","807040"," won your five minute and they've got this huge cluster here which is very bearish, okay, and if"
"807040","816520"," they can maintain staying underneath the one in five minute, if they can maintain"
"816520","825200"," this here right, it's kind of a place where you want to be actually taking a put here, right here"
"825200","831960"," and looking for lower lows and you still might say to yourself why would you do that here cap, one"
"831960","837460"," is because we've lost the one in five minute right, we're underneath the hourly and the key point"
"837460","842660"," here is we've lost momentum, so where this might seem like this is a by the dip kind of a"
"842660","848460"," situation right where we are right now, in reality you're looking for a put to be selling above"
"848460","853560"," right here and this is, let's take a look at what price this is right here, it's right at 412,"
"854540","860300"," 26, right, bears are going to try to defend this right now, so what we're going to we're going to"
"860300","864180"," watch for and the other thing too is when we're right here when you're seeing this velocity come"
"864180","868820"," down, this velocity doesn't start building itself back up here, if it starts to actually go like"
"868820","876180"," this, you can actually front run puts in the market if you continue to see velocity breakdown on"
"876180","882940"," the hourly, even if price isn't showing, even if price is coming up currently, if you see velocity"
"882940","892850"," coming down, you'll see price follow after, so we'll pay attention this as the time goes on"
"892850","897650"," here and what we're going to do is we're going to look at this it's the 412.09, so we're"
"897650","903530"," going to roll right back over to the mainstream and I'm going to draw in some boxes for you here"
"903530","909090"," and I want you to see that there are bears right here they're going to want to defend this and"
"909090","916470"," as long as they defend this right now, we'll pop in some EMA's here for you so you can follow"
"916470","926470"," along, see what an EMA here and oh yeah we got all the funky EMA's going on style, we'll do"
"926470","931830"," a 2070 EMA, we'll get rid of this one right over here, we'll make this one, what do we like"
"931830","940990"," green or yellow, you guys like money green, we'll make that you have money green, we'll make this"
"940990","953480"," kind of a little bit thicker, we'll"
"953480","963200"," do this color here, this yellow, good, and so we get this yellow one, always be above this yellow"
"963200","969720"," color here and then we'll do one this 120 and probably make this like I think we'll base the 113"
"969720","977540"," or something like that, makes one red and size, we'll make this one kind of fat right there, looks"
"977540","987540"," kind of cool, done and I don't like that color, I think that color is gross, get rid of that"
"987540","997980"," one right there, we don't need that one, change this color to uh right there, perfect,"
"1000290","1007950"," Christmas colors, bears want to be selling this, this whole area right here, they need to defend"
"1007950","1014910"," this right here right, we need to have price come above to even confirm even to just to confirm"
"1014910","1023690"," right, we need price to come above this and we're also going to need to see your EMA's right here"
"1023690","1031550"," come underneath okay and uh it's gonna be kind of wonky, coming up just like this okay, so this is"
"1031550","1035609"," price right here in the green, until you get this confirmation above like you can't even take a"
"1035609","1043290"," trade right now uh as a bull or call this a bottom here until we actually defend this this zone"
"1043290","1049970"," above, it's roughly uh 412, 15 or something like that, so my point two would be that you would take"
"1049970","1057770"," a put here and defend this position uh with a stop above here, I know that sounds crazy uh but"
"1057770","1063930"," until we see some until we see uh an hourly ramp here and some kind of a, some kind of"
"1063930","1071950"," a um a proof, you're not going to see us begin to regain a trip higher here, so we'll watch"
"1071950","1077550"," this, we'll watch this bottom currently and we'll see if we can trade above uh and in the"
"1077550","1087040"," background I get some stuff to do, yeah there's no risk, yeah so so if you're to buy this bottom"
"1087040","1091980"," right now this is a very highly risky trade, right now the bears are sitting here, teeing off,"
"1092060","1099800"," selling, you could technically, if you wanted to do some scalping, you could have bought this low"
"1099800","1105340"," down here and traded this up, but this is a classic bear setup, right, sell it down, come right"
"1105340","1109480"," back up for the first rejection and they're going to be looking for it right here to tee back off"
"1109480","1114900"," to go lower, so bears are in control right now, bears got this, they sold it right here, they sold"
"1114900","1121720"," it above over there and they're just waiting right here for you to sell it right back down, now if"
"1121720","1125900"," you're bullish here and you're like oh you know cap you're wrong, we're buying the dip, I agree"
"1125900","1132560"," with that, we're buying the dip, but if you wanted to take a trade that's guaranteed, you need to"
"1132560","1140460"," wait for price to come above here and recheck itself and then trade higher to take this, keep in"
"1140460","1145960"," mind again new cash carry, take this long trade in the market, got a Boston Q&A, so we got"
"1145960","1150200"," the video on the feed there, Feds Collins currently at the stand wasn't scheduled to be speaking at"
"1150200","1154720"," this event, Feds cash carry are yet to come to the stand to ask questions, again there's some"
"1154720","1158800"," activity on the video, it is up on the feed, and this is actually a really good, this is actually"
"1158800","1163560"," a really good setup for you if you're a dip buyer to be looking for, for like you looking for"
"1163560","1172520"," a dip to buy, you are looking for you know that sell that retest here, right, it was rejected and"
"1172520","1177320"," then you want to see the breakup above price, you want to see the moving averages come up with you,"
"1177520","1185040"," the retest and then you're off, okay that's where you buy the dip right here, $35 billion in 10"
"1185040","1188900"," year notes, you saw a prior bid to cover a future three by the day and you bought a high"
"1188900","1194500"," yield of three spot five at 75%, just taking a look at some notes ahead of this auction here as"
"1194500","1199760"," JP Morgan strategist, see the auction needing additional outright right concession versus Tuesday's"
"1199760","1200340"," closing level."
"1200780","1203040"," Given valuations remaining relatively rich."
"1203500","1204840"," Looking to the latest CEO. "
"1204880","1206580"," This is exactly where they are right here."
"1206720","1214540"," Shows that speculators were net short, 542,000 10 year note contracts and net short 126,000 ultra"
"1214540","1215240"," 10 year contracts."
"1215820","1217640"," Tuesday possible source of covering demand. "
"1218260","1222960"," So looking to primary dealers positions in these seven to 11 year sector, they weren't at long two"
"1222960","1228960"," spot nine billion dollars in the weekend of January 25th versus the two spot seven billion dollar"
"1228960","1230700"," average net short over the past year."
"1230820","1235300"," So a slight increase on net shorts compared to the average there from primary dealers."
"1237540","1239020"," Let me just second here. "
"1244920","1247600"," I'll set up your levels for you today."
"1250180","1263650"," 4.13.08. Here's"
"1263650","1264310"," your pivot point."
"1264530","1267710"," This is your negative debt daily gamma underneath this pivot point. "
"1271890","1273750"," That's one for us for nine 68."
"1274650","1275310"," Sorry about it."
"1275470","1277130"," Didn't seven to seven to five and up all night. "
"1277590","1279650"," I lost, not lost yet."
"1280390","1283190"," I've got someone working on a computer for me."
"1284830","1287990"," And it's now going to turn into a backup for a four. "
"1288870","1290350"," Yeah, way, way, way down here."
"1297350","1298770"," Here's your S two down below."
"1299470","1301530"," Make this all come up for you so you don't get lost here. "
"1303070","1305950"," The S three is 400 way down here, right?"
"1305950","1308050"," That's three is way, way, way, way down here."
"1308890","1309290"," 476."

"1317860","1318660"," Bears want to come down it."
"1318900","1321360"," You guys, you guys see what's sitting behind me?"
"1324360","1325860"," You guys see that back there?"
"1327380","1330880"," So here's your pivot point right here for your R one, R two, R three."
"1332320","1336920"," You're going to be looking for, for for 1860. "
"1338000","1338120"," Whoo."
"1343870","1347190"," Here's your R one, 422, baby."
"1347770","1353910"," Look at how high this is, 422 flat holes are like, man, I want to go higher so bad. "
"1356070","1358650"," This is our two, our two right here."
"1359510","1362450"," And then you guys want to see the Valhalla moment, right?"
"1362630","1363990"," The failure to make a new high."
"1366390","1368110"," Huge range expansion, right?"
"1368430","1373690"," 427.50. I bet you the bears are out there just drooling right now to start selling this stuff down. "
"1376890","1377290"," Okay."
"1384520","1386560"," See, we can get that all spun up for you."
"1389140","1391760"," Oh, yeah, I get that nice little gap above here. "
"1394570","1396770"," Let me know in the comments if you think we break above here."
"1398190","1401130"," Well, because the momentum is turning up a little bit."
"1401290","1403550"," So the live video for this is on the feed. "
"1403570","1406790"," So again, Feds Cash Car is speaking at the Boston Economic Club now."
"1411110","1411870"," Right there."
"1414850","1419070"," Yeah, there's no so if you were to want you to know out there, if you're a bull, right?"
"1419770","1422750"," If you're to trade this set up 10 times, you probably lose. "
"1423850","1431410"," Yeah, you probably lose this four to six times."
"1432270","1437130"," Well, you could trade it to this red bar right here, but if you were like, I'm full port and"
"1437130","1443570"," calls right here, the place the full, full, full more calls here is above this red bar."
"1449630","1451830"," All right, now let's see what you guys are talking about. "
"1452010","1455810"," My whole setup is like everything in this setup is brand new."
"1456390","1464150"," And then I had had a artifact from previous images and stuff, like stuff for the production side of"
"1464150","1465610"," stuff was all wonky."
"1465850","1470630"," And then when I turned the machine off and then this morning, I turned the machine back on and it"
"1470630","1473130"," was none of it stuck. "
"1476180","1480940"," So if you're, if you're bullish here or not, I'm interested to find out if you're, if you think"
"1480940","1486090"," this is the dip to buy, let's take a look at that."
"1486130","1488550"," I'm going to take a look at the market breath indicator real quick in the background."
"1489190","1492350"," And I want to see if we burned off the rotating right now. "
"1492470","1496450"," The five minutes time to the top of the hour now, again, the US is selling $35 billion in 10"
"1496450","1496950"," year notes."

"1499730","1504250"," It was two to 53 with a prior high yield of three spot at five, seven to five percent. "
"1504650","1508470"," We're definitely good at selling right now is currently speaking at the Boston club."

"1525080","1526980"," Yeah, I'll give you some downside targets right now. "
"1527280","1528740"," That's a good question downside targets."
"1571220","1572300"," First one's right there."
"1593110","1595750"," Right there, four or two, 40. "
"1597210","1602630"," Let me just lose to four or three flat about there."
"1614100","1615240"," Right about there."
"1632290","1644180"," Because every $1 in Tesla price target, let me"
"1644180","1645080"," look on the one hour. "
"1646040","1646400"," One minute."
"1646700","1648700"," One minute's good doing quite well here."
"1650240","1651940"," Five minutes doing well here. "
"1653820","1656720"," Fifteen minutes doing well."
"1657880","1660300"," One hour is trying to recover right now."
"1662540","1664800"," And this is what I'm going to show you here is I want to show you. "
"1665160","1668540"," Let me go through this with you real quick."
"1669120","1669600"," Daily."
"1672160","1673040"," One hour. "
"1681610","1682350"," Fifteen minute."
"1692050","1693530"," One minute right there."
"1695550","1697750"," So we'll scroll back over so you guys can see this. "
"1704920","1706040"," You know, let me bring it by."
"1706260","1707400"," I have to actually bring it by."
"1710960","1714440"," This cash car says the services side of the economy is still hot. "
"1715280","1720200"," So far have had much effects on the labor market."
"1727120","1727980"," Second here."
"1730060","1732800"," And cash car as that we will need to do more. "
"1733140","1735040"," But how much is not clear."
"1735520","1738160"," Yeah, I'm looking for some four or 10 four or 10 P's."
"1740000","1742620"," I'm going to try to jump in up here and try to buy some puts. "
"1746400","1747420"," Right in here."
"1747420","1749680"," The results of the US 10, you know, talk in here."
"1749860","1751860"," The treasury when issued is due at the top of the hour. "
"1771140","1775060"," Treasury when issued 10 year yield at three spot, six, four, three percent ahead of this auction."
"1775360","1779720"," So again, I said 10 year treasury when issued yield, three spot, six, four, three percent ahead of"
"1779720","1781240"," this $35 billion auction."
"1784660","1786100"," So I've got set up in the background. "
"1786420","1790480"," I've got a four 10 P's and I've also got set up."
"1793880","1795180"," Four thirteen C's."
"1795960","1798660"," Oh, here. "
"1806380","1807720"," Didn't walk you back here."
"1819520","1823680"," I'm watching both these trades for 10 P and for 13 C."
"1824820","1829220"," If we start to roll over here, we're getting kind of roll over in here and we start to trade"
"1829220","1831240"," below this one minute."
"1831240","1835880"," This cash car is his wage growth is too hot now to support two percent inflation puts over here. "
"1836040","1839500"," If we begin to trade above price, the one minute crosses higher."
"1840100","1841600"," I'll buy the calls right here."
"1842040","1844160"," I'll buy some puts right here depending on which way we go. "
"1845800","1850200"," That's kind of adding that we need to get wages to around three percent in terms of growth."
"1863900","1864880"," No, but that's not frozen."
"1865380","1865800"," Hold on a second. "
"1870650","1877030"," So the 10 year notes a bit to cover ratio coming in now at two to sixty six, two to"
"1877030","1881770"," sixty six, the high rates at three spot, six, one, three percent, three spot, six, one, three"
"1881770","1882110"," percent."
"1882370","1885070"," The U.S. sells thirty five billion dollars in 10 year notes there."
"1885310","1888010"," 24% off at high. "
"1888930","1892890"," We're seeing a primary deal is taking five spot, three, six percent of U.S. 10 year note sales,"
"1893310","1897650"," direct to 15 spot, one nine percent in direct at seventy nine spot, four, five percent."
"1897650","1900830"," U.S. 10 year notes drawing there at three spot, six, one, three percent."
"1901070","1905010"," That is against the three spot, six, four, three percent pre-sale when issued yield. "
"1907430","1908970"," Get some walkingness with this."
"1909530","1911230"," Spook maps not want to do it, is it?"
"1917880","1920900"," Getting some, getting some issues with my new rig air."
"1920980","1921600"," It's not doing it. "
"1933500","1934540"," I can tell you one second here."
"1985340","1989320"," Let's catch guys as we don't want to cause a recession, but we know we have a job to do"
"1989320","1989740"," on inflation."
"2045920","2053020"," The U "
"2053020","2059679",".S. is not doing it. "
"2064239","2068540"," Let's catch guys as financial markets have more confidence than we have, but inflation will fall"
"2068540","2068980"," quickly."
"2072860","2074480"," You just don't have to work for right now."
"2075300","2080340"," I don't think Treasury is extending their gains after a strong demand in the 10 year note auction. "
"2082020","2087739"," To watch this price come higher, a retest of this price, and then you'll see a rocket ship higher."
"2094489","2096030"," Was that working for the moment, I guess?"
"2096410","2097030"," I think that's working."
"2107940","2109020"," It'll do it for now, right?"
"2142460","2146200"," If you're a bull, you want to see, like we said before, this white line come above. "
"2146960","2152220"," You want to see price follow and retest."
"2153240","2154920"," That's where the long is right there."
"2167060","2168480"," One minute is strong right here. "
"2238230","2242170"," Let's catch guys as most of my colleagues expect rates to go above five percent."
"2242170","2244530"," But it is certainly possible that it will go higher though."
"2244750","2249790"," Most of my colleagues expect rates to go above five percent, but it is certainly possible that it"
"2249790","2250350"," will go higher. "
"2250810","2251330"," That is bullish."
"2256710","2259850"," I'm in 414 Cs."
"2260510","2264790"," Let's catch coming as we will then hold rates for a long time and then decide if rates will go"
"2264790","2265770"," higher or down. "
"2276990","2280150"," You want to wait for the white line to come back up."
"2280230","2283010"," You should get another retest down below at some point."
"2283510","2314250"," I'm going"
"2314250","2316170"," to retest of the one minute right now. "
"2324010","2325890"," I don't know what you guys can see on the screen right now."
"2393890","2394910"," I just can see it looks better."
"2414590","2417750"," You want to see the white line hold if the white line does not hold. "
"2418990","2471110"," It'll be a rejection adding to"
"2471110","2471550"," my position."
"2499650","2501930"," I've been for like 36.37 cents."
"2502670","2517020"," Now trading 41 cents, trading"
"2517020","2517980"," 42 cents. "
"2535890","2537810"," I wanted to add some more just then and I didn't."
"2538290","2539990"," No, no, we're not doing that."
"2540490","2546970"," I'm trying to grab anything I like in the mid 30s. "
"2548870","2550910"," Then we'll hit the buy button on 40 cents."
"2585440","2588680"," Still trading 40 cents, 41 cents, 40 cents bouncing around."
"2590260","2594340"," If I can pick it in the other like 30, 35 cents to add, now we're down to 39 cents. "
"2595000","2597160"," We're going to grab like 35 cents, 32 cents."
"2597380","2601860"," We get a liquidation break here for a minute or not."
"2602200","2603180"," We'll see if we can grab some more here. "
"2616540","2618320"," These bears want to sell this down so bad."
"2630980","2632600"," One minute's getting a little bit weaker."
"2639920","2641460"," The daily looks like shit. "
"2642580","2643700"," 50 minutes looks good."
"2645040","2647900"," I'll at least try to make a make a run back up here."
"2652950","2653810"," I added some more. "
"2658780","2660720"," Put some more calls on right here."
"2671040","2674320"," Julie expects me to have stops below."
"2683660","2689560"," If we do reject and trade lower, you want if it starts to blast down, look for a place to"
"2689560","2690900"," get out in here at some point. "
"2699870","2700850"," Right there."
"2704430","2707910"," If there's any kind of liquidation break, if we ever trade down below here."
"2709650","2713910"," You can't wait until here to get out of your trade. "
"2719320","2720440"," Two targets above."
"2721460","2724140"," We've got this previous high on the day here."
"2724260","2725040"," I don't know if you can see it. "
"2727950","2729930"," You can see where they're selling over here."
"2730350","2732270"," You can see where these gaps are down below."
"2732750","2733910"," I tried to sell this. "
"2734590","2736250"," I'll probably bring this down a little bit more."
"2736650","2737410"," Like right there."
"2746810","2750330"," I'm just waiting on the one minute to catch up and see if it rejects or gets carried forward. "
"2750690","2755050"," 103 count of parties like 2.0.0.6 trillion dollars at the Fed Reverse Repo operation."
"2767740","2770520"," The daily looks like shit is the daily."
"2771320","2772520"," The daily looks bad. "
"2788490","2790030"," We're going to retest the one minute right here."
"2790470","2791390"," Try to send it lower."
"2791390","2805810"," 4.11.75. They're"
"2805810","2808090"," going to try to break through these stops right here. "
"2822740","2823520"," Hold on here."
"2823740","2824160"," Give me a second."
"2826060","2827440"," Give me a second here. "
"2827720","2828500"," I've got something going on."
"2832380","2833240"," Sons of Liberty."
"2834200","2835820"," I don't know what that's about. "
"2835960","2836680"," Probably something horrible."
"2859590","2862110"," These pairs, man, they're trying to get right underneath here."
"2862350","2864430"," They're trying to stay underneath this red bar right here. "
"2864550","2865850"," They want to start reversing this."
"2866930","2870450"," They're like, there's like we're going down here and then we're going down there."
"2870950","2872650"," And I'm like, I don't know, baby. "
"2877640","2879920"," 1.5, 15 minute, hourly's good."
"2880660","2881540"," Daily candle though, man."
"2881880","2885240"," This looks like solar rip, even if we go higher here. "
"2886500","2888000"," At least on a daily basis."
"2889000","2890980"," Market breath indicator is rolling over slightly."
"2891860","2894320"," We haven't looked at any of the sub sectors yet to see if there's any rotation. "
"2895440","2897680"," We'll pay attention to that as the day moves on."
"2897680","2899640"," We'll take a walk around the market and take a look."
"2912680","2914360"," We'll watch for a liquidation break here. "
"2950820","2952760"," We'll take a look at a UNG if you want chase."
"2957040","2959020"," A moment I got out of this trade."
"2959980","2961520"," So we start trading higher here. "
"2962500","2965040"," A moment I've dealt with this trade, we'll take a look at UNG."
"2969340","2976960"," And if we can get up here, at least, maybe we'll get out of the trade and then we can"
"2976960","2978060"," at least take that part of the trade."
"2979400","2982860"," Or if we blast below, I get stopped out here or anything like that. "
"2984140","2986320"," I'll close up the trade and show you UNG."
"2989760","2992280"," Now trading $0.39. I've been bouncing around here."
"2993120","2997800"," I'm in total for, I don't know what I'm in for right now total, but I know it's low. "
"2998000","3002440"," It's buying at like $0.32, $0.35, stuff like that."
"3005830","3007910"," It's been some of the time at the bottom of the hour."
"3008110","3012130"," Do you get the bank of Canada releasing their summary of deliberations?"
"3012930","3014970"," Is it essentially the bank of Canada meeting minutes?"
"3015390","3016250"," This is a new release. "
"3016450","3017830"," Bank of Canada have not done this before."
"3018150","3020670"," That under IMF recommendation, they are now doing this."
"3021410","3030630"," We'll take a look at, we'll take a look at, we'll take a look at, let's"
"3030630","3034070"," say, UNG. "
"3036780","3039360"," Or you take your profit, stuff like that on UNG."
"3039740","3040620"," Why is UNG?"
"3040800","3046880"," I didn't know UNG wasn't going up at this point, but we'll take a look at where you could take"
"3046880","3055940"," profit losing some call premium right now."
"3058290","3059910"," It's just grinding down call premium. "
"3074920","3076560"," Bears know they don't want to give this up."
"3076740","3078660"," They know if they give this up or off and run into."
"3078840","3082900"," The moment they give this up here, we're back in buy mode above. "
"3084140","3086080"," They're going to do their best to sell this down."
"3091650","3094910"," It's kind of a crucial place for bears to stay in control."
"3095930","3099650"," The moment they give this up, this isn't quite bear capitulation, but it's pretty close. "
"3107790","3116150"," Now back up trading $0.37. $0.38. Another note here would be that puts are being ground down in"
"3116150","3116630"," this process."
"3117410","3120370"," There's a bunch of, there's $289,000."
"3121730","3124770"," $4.10. It's only worth $0.25 right now. "
"3125550","3128770"," But I'm going to assume at some point when they're cheap enough, we'll roll back over and try to"
"3128770","3129270"," print those."
"3130430","3141210"," That's $4.10. Maybe we only get to $4.13.08. Now trading $0.39. $0.40. I"
"3141210","3142610"," can get to like $0.45 and be happy."
"3143630","3148490"," I'd take even $0.60. If we took $0.60 or $0.50, anything in there, $0.45, $0.48."
"3150050","3150710"," Something like that, I'd be happy. "
"3178970","3181370"," Bull's starting to win this fight right now."
"3184520","3185920"," Trying to win this fight right now."
"3186240","3187220"," I should say not starting to. "
"3188200","3188620"," Attempting to."
"3192780","3195420"," Should get a nice fat squeeze coming up here in just a few moments."
"3197020","3206510"," Now trading $0.40, $0.41. Come on, bulls. "
"3206510","3212120"," Bull's buying right now."
"3212160","3212900"," They're doing good job."
"3214560","3216640"," More buyers than sellers on the one minute. "
"3224340","3226240"," Five minutes starting to ramp in the background."
"3229700","3231780"," 15 minutes not doing too shabby here."
"3235060","3236820"," Hourly man is sucking again. "
"3241820","3250480"," I just took off half my position at $0.41 at $0.41. We're looking at the hourly here."
"3250640","3252340"," It's not doing so hot."
"3254640","3259280"," We're coming into the half hour right now, $1.24. We got six more minutes left for bulls. "
"3259960","3261220"," I still got half my position on."
"3262600","3271040"," I'm looking for at least $4.13.08. And then a price target above at $4.14.50 or so."
"3273460","3275180"," But I don't like us coming into this hourly. "
"3275420","3277980"," We're losing some steam here."
"3278320","3281820"," Again, this is the first time the Bank of Canada is releasing this."
"3281820","3285980"," It's essentially Bank of Canada meeting minutes being released upon IMF recommendation. "
"3291050","3292770"," Not a bad trade though, believe it or not."
"3293030","3295070"," It was almost 10 cent trade."
"3295210","3296490"," It was a 25% win. "
"3299350","3301010"," Stop still below down below."
"3301330","3302530"," We need to get a new high right here."
"3303410","3305370"," I don't like not getting a new high. "
"3305370","3307350"," You can see traded higher."
"3308550","3311290"," Came up got a new high right on this trade at least."
"3312110","3313790"," And we didn't get a high here. "
"3313890","3318250"," We have to get the high by $1.30. It's kind of crucial here."
"3320090","3321410"," It's $1.25 in the afternoon."
"3321710","3322650"," You got like five more minutes left. "
"3322830","3323650"," You got to catch a new high."
"3324610","3327410"," And we're getting another kind of a retest on the one minute."
"3327630","3329050"," You can see the first one right here. "
"3329130","3329670"," This is a high."
"3330170","3331950"," This one right here is taking a little bit longer."
"3332950","3336290"," So probably hold this trade once here. "
"3336770","3339350"," We've got 10 more contracts on right now."
"3339750","3344030"," We can't get a new high here in the next few like five minutes or so and grab this."
"3345210","3347550"," We start rolling it down and over like this. "
"3347850","3348830"," I'm going to pull it all off."
"3360490","3361610"," Trading 40 cents."
"3363170","3365010"," Give me like 48 cents, man. "
"3365270","3366690"," 50 cents, 60 cents."
"3366730","3367710"," I'll take any of that shit."
"3368530","3369030"," I'll take it. "
"3369270","3370430"," I'll take whatever you can give me."
"3371210","3372010"," Hey, Tony, how are you doing?"
"3372810","3373430"," Thanks, man."
"3378130","3379610"," Yeah, you're looking for. "
"3381070","3381470"," You're going to."
"3382290","3384550"," It's the hourly that we're really watching here."
"3385330","3387270"," The bulls are not putting it together here. "
"3387270","3391430"," So this is kind of like the bear."
"3391710","3393790"," Yeah, nice little liquidity breakdown below."
"3394190","3395710"," If you're upside down in calls right now. "
"3396830","3399710"," You're just going to wait for one more green bar up."
"3400850","3403750"," And you'll try to try to grab your stops."
"3412360","3413600"," 127 in the afternoon. "

"4067030","4072230"," three forty five or something I don't know how you do that I don't know how you buy puts at"
"4072230","4077090"," three forty five or yeah three forty five and you're like I'm still holding them they're gonna"
"4077090","4082190"," they're gonna print eventually I'm like okay all right cool whatever I guess you are I don't know"
"4082190","4089550"," if I believe them but it looks like it's like no no no no short left behind it looks like"
"4089550","4096170"," I'm like overall on the chart looks like no even if we're down right but down for the next the"
"4096170","4102450"," price isn't following I'll show you guys some stuff so like these down days price isn't really"
"4102450","4111990"," following the breath and so even though we're bearish right now you're not seeing price follow"
"4111990","4121810"," breath going down oh yeah teeing right off in the one and five so price is not being"
"4121810","4129370"," reflected in any kind of selling that we have in the underlying you really want to see that selling"
"4129370","4136130"," and we're not seeing it so pullbacks are good right if you're a bull you don't want to be those"
"4136130","4140390"," are few things I got to go over that I haven't gone over first of all if you're a bull"
"4140390","4149810"," there are and should be pullbacks for more buyers to step in to send you up higher and do"
"4149810","4154870"," it right you do want you do want to buy the dip kind of an opportunity right you want to"
"4154870","4161350"," go buy the dip you want to see the momentum slow on the bears so you can buy a dip"
"4161350","4167270"," in safety but they're the key part here is normally do you guys think about this as whether you're"
"4167270","4173450"," a bearable it doesn't matter only to like just like deep thoughts with Captain Jim for five seconds"
"4173450","4183430"," when we would roll the market over in 2022 price had massive velocity down"
"4183430","4189550"," you would see one two three days boom we're down like one two three hundred points it was nasty"
"4189550","4196410"," right and you're just not seeing that over time right now right you'll see a couple doubt two three"
"4196410","4202150"," down days and price doesn't follow as a matter of fact we saw that in we saw that in December"
"4202150","4209890"," December was the key was it was the confirmation October was a nice fat bottom but you really saw"
"4209890","4217070"," it in December when we traded sideways the market breath had plummeted and price hadn't followed"
"4217070","4223510"," and that was the key point knowing that we were going up at that time and I'll show you I'll"
"4223510","4230930"," show you this I'm saying I'm bringing this up and show you guys what I'm talking about here I'm"
"4230930","4262780"," gonna bring this up in the background real quick give me just a second here it's kind"
"4262780","4277040"," of a neat kind of neat"
"4277040","4286440"," thing to be looking at give me a second here where is"
"4286440","4295740"," man I got some wonky shit going on here"
"4295740","4305250"," just let me show you guys something real quick okay so they got all kinds of nonsense going on"
"4305250","4315170"," so I want you to see something here now you can't see it on this for whatever reason you"
"4315170","4324730"," can't see the breath had taken a nose dive here but I want you to see is a better way"
"4324730","4333930"," to look at it so when you see when you see breath decline right here"
"4333930","4343750"," you can see that price the price decline was insane this is insane move right here right so"
"4343750","4352570"," price was proceeding right or faster than breath right price declined faster than breath declined"
"4352570","4361710"," here right you kind of saw the same move down here right but we got a nice fat low down"
"4361710","4366670"," here right great volume down below and then this is the next area I want you to look at though"
"4366670","4376090"," right here and we had this decline in here right you didn't see price follow you see that you saw"
"4376090","4384330"," price here didn't follow breath only to see that okay and just looking at this the very simple is"
"4384330","4390750"," that crayon drawings right you see huge price moves down huge price moves down and then in December"
"4390750","4398050"," you didn't quite see that right you didn't see price following breath down and you're not yet at"
"4398050","4405090"," this point seeing it here even so even so at this point you see how breath has come down right"
"4405090","4411250"," and price didn't follow and you're now seeing this happen again right price didn't follow and you"
"4411250","4416730"," saw it again price didn't follow and you're kind of looking for that same thing over here you want"
"4416730","4422070"," to see breath come down right and price only maybe come down a little bit you know what I'm saying"
"4422070","4429290"," if you see that it's showing you that there are large players not institution size more than likely"
"4429290","4437250"," but hedge fund size there's still wrong this market higher now if you start to see the price of S "
"4437250","4445650","&P 500 per se or leading right faster than breath is coming down that's a scary thing right if you"
"4445650","4451530"," only see us like right here and price is blasting down this is this is what is indicative of 2022"
"4451530","4459130"," then you can kind of foreshadow that we're not done right we're gonna go way down here right you'd"
"4459130","4463390"," see something like that happen so you're if you're a bear you're looking for that if you're a bear"
"4463390","4469370"," and you're like hey I'm bearish this market right here this is the top right here you do want to"
"4469370","4477390"," see breath have not come down a bunch but price just like leading wam wam wam wam we're breaking"
"4477390","4482730"," levels those are things you're looking for and we're not seeing that quite yet will we see it I"
"4482730","4488050"," don't know you don't know we don't know as traders or investors but if we do begin to see price"
"4488050","4494770"," leading the way down you'll know right you'll know that it's more than likely not gonna just be"
"4494770","4499670"," this little price down here and we're gonna start blasting through levels so you're looking for"
"4499670","4506830"," that currently at this moment we're not seeing that right we're not seeing that on any kind of"
"4506830","4512990"," selling that we have we're not seeing breath you can see it back here right this isn't a ton of"
"4512990","4517030"," selling if you don't if you see breath all the way at the bottom and you see us trading down"
"4517030","4522010"," here you know the dip gets bought here and the price has only come down a little bit you can"
"4522010","4529950"," kind of figure out that you'll write back in this area of balance right you see what I'm saying"
"4529950","4535530"," here and as a bull you want to be buying this stuff right if price isn't blasting down with breath"
"4535530","4540250"," they have no what it no one else left to sell to make sense and if you're a bull and"
"4540250","4545290"," you want to buy something sexy right you know bills are like I want to buy this I want to"
"4545290","4549410"," buy this I want to buy this and buy this and buy this and buy this right here right it's"
"4549410","4553930"," a bull they're saying right they're like I'm buying all this I'm buying everything I don't fear of"
"4553930","4558690"," getting missing out right so you get that little yellow box down here and bulls are like man I want"
"4558690","4569060"," to buy this so bad right air right but there's a problem and that's this right here you see"
"4569060","4574400"," how we got a new high right here we've interacted and we blast it off right if we come down"
"4574400","4579460"," into this red line right here we already did we blast it off if we don't get this reaction and"
"4579460","4589320"," blast off here then what are we looking for probably looking for lower right we're looking"
"4589320","4597600"," for lower at that point and you can see back here the support back here right so like well come"
"4597600","4603080"," Jim then what are we looking for it's right down here right at this s2 s3 right you can see"
"4603080","4607700"," where the white and the red reacted we could even actually trade down from here right trade down"
"4607700","4615000"," here and then roll over until this red line comes up back up fight our way back up and then"
"4615000","4620740"," we're off and running once again now if you're a bear you're like if you're a bear you truly want"
"4620740","4627220"," to see price right now you want to start seeing price start moving without breath coming down like"
"4627220","4634410"," start moving you start smashing through levels here you're gonna then start seeing that you know"
"4634410","4644250"," Valhalla 3600 the 3065 that JPM once we're just not seeing that even"
"4644250","4650170"," with this inside day right now we're not seeing they realize you have the spin and top up here the"
"4650170","4655390"," doji up here or this is the great kind of a gravestone the gravestone right here right here's the"
"4655390","4660650"," gravestone right here that should have been super bearish then yesterday we actually got good news"
"4660650","4667450"," for the market again inside day today but this doesn't look to me like bloodbath bill down here yet"
"4667450","4673290"," but not yet you have to prove yourself to actually get down there you know that by the dippers are"
"4673290","4679590"," still in and you know that J POW is out there and he is I mean J POW yesterday was"
"4679590","4689250"," bearish hawkish but not the kind that were going to 3000 this week if you start if he keeps"
"4689250","4696370"," continuing to to raise rates there are still bulls you can tell by price right now there are still"
"4696370","4704150"," bulls looking to buy a dip right where is that dip we just showed you and there's two places that"
"4704150","4709450"," the bulls want to be buying that's down here and right down here bulls want to be defending this"
"4709450","4714850"," right they want to buy a dip here they want to buy a dip there without a doubt because this"
"4714850","4721210"," is trend heading heading higher right they love juicy dip buying so we'll look at that one more"
"4721210","4726490"," time in the hourly and see where they are what they want to buy they bought this yesterday right"
"4726490","4733210"," and they're gonna attempt to buy this again today or tomorrow likely you'll see some futures"
"4733210","4738890"," sellers trying to commit and sell this down below here by tomorrow I would like to see at least"
"4738890","4745870"," this S2 personally I would love to buy this big fat dip down here and like trade nice and free"
"4745870","4752550"," above then you got trap call buyers right you already know that yesterday I guarantee it guarantee"
"4752550","4759150"," yesterday you had guarantee you had like call buyers like right here guaranteed 100% that's how it"
"4759150","4764810"," always happens they don't buy dips right top buyers constantly wait for trend and they jump on it"
"4764810","4772740"," and they're trapped so you get you get you give them throwing down here right and we're losing the"
"4772740","4778720"," daily right now losing the daily means they're gonna try to sell all of these rips as time"
"4778720","4788850"," progresses as the as like the day is ending who's we"
"4788850","4798790"," who's we not us right who we buy the actual"
"4798790","4811890"," dips bring that back up for you no"
"4814100","4822940"," we will dip 20% I don't see that yet I we don't normally historically we don't see that right"
"4822940","4832880"," now and they the price action in the market right now is not indicative of or at least yet"
"4832880","4838200"," it's not indicative of that if we start doing that we'd like price starts blasting down I'll be all"
"4838200","4847300"," game on board on that on that trade but currently it's not currently it's not showing us"
"4848680","4855480"," that you know that ass blaster move down you can see that we don't have any velocity in this move"
"4855480","4864460"," down you can see that you might get one more capitulation move down below probably down to this 408"
"4864460","4869300"," or even this 402 down here it's not really this really isn't too much of a movement I think I"
"4869300","4876200"," would I would I would guess here that bulls want to see this so they can buy a tradable dip"
"4876200","4881620"," this is like a dip that you don't have to worry about you know you don't like paper hand it"
"4881620","4890000"," where you're like yeah I got my 10% I got my 20% and I feel safe buying a"
"4890000","4907130"," dip so that the safe dip buys down here for bulls and that is the truth now we'll"
"4907130","4914450"," talk about yeah so I don't normally buy I don't normally buy puts only because they're not built so"
"4914450","4923560"," puts are kind of a weird thing calls are built to be bought in held they're also built so that"
"4923560","4930360"," they print better believe it or not then puts right if I buy a put for 50 cents let's say"
"4930360","4937600"," right they're generally speaking good for the move only so bears have a tough go a bit right if"
"4937600","4944900"," you're short short is not bad I like shorts but I don't like puts I don't mind puts on SPX"
"4944900","4951380"," but on the spy itself they're typically built or not typically they were built originally as a"
"4951380","4958880"," market hedge and we'll talk about that at some point too so where we are in the market puts are"
"4958880","4968500"," cheap right so we're in the in the earlier bear market of 2022 puts were expensive and they held"
"4968500","4974440"," some of their value you could sell the market hold puts and they would print eventually right very"
"4974440","4981680"," good very good to own puts then actually very good to sell puts and sell calls right now it's"
"4981680","4987700"," better to be buying calls and buying puts so even if you let's say so I own Tesla stock right"
"4987700","4996500"," even if you don't own Tesla stock it's really cheap right now to buy a hedge so there's no reason"
"4996500","5003640"," for you not to buy a hedge that's they're cheap and if they print it prints so last Friday when"
"5003640","5008380"," we were at close right we were on the clothes on Friday let's see if this is an actual dip"
"5008380","5015460"," here let me let me see if this is a good dip by here so let me get an example"
"5015460","5026650"," okay so last Friday when we're closing out I was like well I was like I'm holding hold on"
"5026650","5036540"," here I'm gonna do something here so last Friday I was holding Tesla stock and I'm gonna"
"5036540","5043690"," unmute a bunch of this stuff here so last Friday I was holding Tesla stock and this is indicative"
"5043690","5049950"," of a bull run not a bull market make sure you guys out there know the difference between a bull"
"5049950","5056950"," market and a bull run oh there are two different things a lot of like misspeaking on the internet I"
"5056950","5062550"," see which is kind of kind of makes me laugh it kind of makes me giggle so not laugh but"
"5062550","5069450"," just giggle now we're gonna put on the bear lights on here man now but here's the point when I"
"5069450","5076990"," went into the clothes on last Friday I own Tesla stock I was able to buy I think a 41"
"5076990","5085730"," cent put I couldn't lose there is no way for me it's funny because I ended up they end up"
"5085730","5093270"," doing really well in that trade because Tesla went up and spy puts printed they printed like when"
"5093270","5098630"," on the opening bells like 71 72 cents or something I closed those out and Tesla was like up three"
"5098630","5107190"," bucks but not like the best outcome now the reality though is if Tesla had gone down and lost one"
"5107190","5114550"," two three dollars on the underlying my cheap puts would have printed any loss that I had in Tesla"
"5114550","5123190"," right if Tesla had gone up a dollar or three dollars on Monday open the puts would have burned but"
"5123190","5130030"," I would have been a net gain of a couple bucks does that make sense so right now it is"
"5130030","5137230"," good for you to own puts like a market hedge not like hey I'm bearish and the market's gonna go"
"5137230","5142830"," to the depths of hell it's really good even if stock it's good for you to own a market hedge"
"5142830","5148910"," that's like bloodbath like all these cost me 10 cents these cost me 20 cents and I don't mean like"
"5148910","5153830"," I would zero date you should be going through the option chain and like finding a month out three"
"5153830","5160890"," month out six month out this is the so if we pretend we're back in January of 2022 and puts"
"5160890","5165750"," are cheap right you just start throwing some on and you're like well cap I don't want to do that"
"5165750","5172530"," we're going up man we're super bullish here my point to you is they're so cheap you guys make so"
"5172530","5177810"," many bad trades out there I hear people out there telling me I'm buying five dollar calls two"
"5177810","5183390"," dollar calls I don't know fucking ten dollar fucking calls and then I'm like the other hedge and"
"5183390","5188050"," they're like no and I'm like they're like 10 cents a month out and they're like they're never gonna"
"5188050","5193590"," print so I'm like that's not that point these are built well right now is a time to buy a"
"5193590","5199290"," hedge on the market because it's so cheap if it's one three six months out and they're this cheap"
"5199290","5205650"," it acts as insurance so you want to add on like a daily like so myself at times I'll add"
"5205650","5211370"," on an overnight zero date put because I own the underlying and I don't want to like wake up on"
"5211370","5219290"," a Monday morning and have some kind of nonsense some crisis or credit crisis whatever kind of"
"5219290","5227210"," nonsense you want to say when the reality is a probably just front running some kind of a fed put"
"5227210","5232170"," some kind of a rate cut and you just don't know about it as a retail trader but my point"
"5232170","5236230"," is puts are cheap so you should have something a little bundle of them you should add them every"
"5236230","5242410"," week have like month out three month out six month out make them make them dirt cheap like ten"
"5242410","5249350"," cents five cents they could you not you can do triple-average ETFs there's a bunch of those out"
"5249350","5255510"," there I like trading the estau gets dirt cheap and you can get them at dirt cheap right like 20"
"5255510","5261350"," cents but like when we're elevated they're like two three buckstone but they hold value over time"
"5261350","5269370"," to right like six month out estau hedge is awesome and cheap spy not so much spy especially if you"
"5269370","5274370"," find if you find interest that's what I like about estau is you can actually dig through their"
"5274370","5281270"," options chain and you'll just find like one strike six months out that has it's just loaded and"
"5281270","5284850"," I'll be like oh there's a bunch of interest on that one the dirt cheap gonna buy those right there"
"5284850","5291450"," and hold on to them for a few months yeah so this is my point behind how puts a structure"
"5291450","5299610"," on a spy claim or swing back around here is you need to time your puts right now so that"
"5299610","5303170"," they print right directionally like if you like if we're gonna bleed off let's say a bleed off"
"5303170","5308450"," right here right you literally need to buy them and then cut them loose right at your price target"
"5308450","5312790"," it's not like like I can hold calls here all but not all day long but I can hold them"
"5312790","5318790"," here for 15 20 30 minutes half an hour an hour whatever and if they go up a little bit"
"5318790","5326570"," I'm probably gonna print 50% 100% the low likely hold as well so for myself I'm just looking"
"5326570","5332630"," for a debt mostly if you're asking me what I do I'll jump in on some puts for a trip"
"5332630","5337730"," lower possibly but generally speaking I'm either using them as protection right now as a hedge"
"5337730","5343390"," right now and I'm just looking for a dip to buy if price starts to accelerate in the down a"
"5343390","5351390"," downward move I'll then start considering trading puts or putting a shorts on that kind of stuff so"
"5351390","5355990"," for me right now it's it's not there's nothing that's saying right now that the market is gonna"
"5355990","5365500"," crash and so that means buy some cheap hedging yeah I'm looking at it right now we're still not"
"5365500","5372420"," above we do the one good thing bulls have is that the one good thing that bulls do have right"
"5372420","5382080"," now is that the the what the daily is coming up it's screaming higher we"
"5382080","5387940"," continue to trade sideways like this in the next couple days we will likely get a nice rip face for"
"5387940","5395940"," coming out of this it's gonna take a couple days two three days let them rotate and shit like that"
"5395940","5401460"," and we should get a nice fat rip nice fat market rip in the next couple days so they say"
"5401460","5422570"," Wednesday hopefully you can have it by Friday or Monday nice Monday gap up see they"
"5422570","5429790"," can look at this five minute here in the background starting to lose the five minute we're just"
"5429790","5439630"," trying to take this down right now currently let me see if I can show you guys some cool stuff"
"5439630","5444930"," in the background here we'll see if you turn some very music back on in just a moment let's see"
"5444930","5454770"," if we can start selling this and let me see if I can okay so here's the trigger okay this"
"5454770","5460670"," is velocity down below you can start to see us selling teeing right off you can see velocity"
"5460670","5467830"," declining you can see this is the zero line where my cursor is tried to have some velocity or start"
"5467830","5473270"," a break below it you can see when velocity breaks below the zero line see the zero line over here"
"5473270","5481010"," we'll start to bloodbath it down below we'll look at velocity on multiple timeframes so the five"
"5481010","5487110"," minutes being lost right now we'll look at the one minute you can see we're losing velocity in the"
"5487110","5493130"," one minute over here you can see we're losing velocity in the five minute on the 15 minutes about"
"5493130","5498530"," to break down here just a moment she gets some nice blood here in the market and then we'll look"
"5498530","5506310"," at the hourly and you can see we're losing the hourly right here and then we'll look at the deli"
"5506310","5513510"," and this is the one that I don't like the deli is what I'm not liking right here and you"
"5513510","5520290"," see these four bars right here where we've lost price you see these bars right here we're losing"
"5520290","5528870"," price watch my cursor over here right and you can see the start of that right here okay"
"5528870","5536590"," now until we get above that zero line I'm gonna expect each day to grow shittier and shittier and"
"5536590","5543330"," the bears to get some acceleration at some point to the downside but price isn't isn't really what"
"5543330","5551130"," we're really seeing the huge price loss here so so for myself I'm just still looking for a dip buy"
"5551130","5587790"," just looking for a dip buy you guys"
"5587790","5591650"," want to buy some you guys want to buy some you guys want to buy some three-day puts with"

"5775810","5787510"," you think we are going down for at least a few days let's let's"
"5787510","5793470"," find out if the audience is smart or not that's smart but cuz our audience is usually pretty smart"
"5793470","5804270"," one two three days for a"
"5804270","5814150"," dip by we're"
"5814150","5825670"," going up from here I don't think so but I'll give it to you hold on try to"
"5825670","5832090"," answer honestly to help your fellow retail trader out one of three days for a dip by we're going up"
"5832090","5841970"," here and then we'll just give it to the blood blood blood crowd okay so I ask you guys"
"5841970","5848050"," this question I think we're going up I think we're going down one to three days for a dip by"
"5848050","5855710"," we're going up from here or do you think I try to answer honestly not your not your emotional state"
"5855710","5862070"," I know that bears been getting kind of fucked up out there you guys kind of have my take on"
"5862070","5871790"," this where I think I my like so far without anything else being validated it's a one to three days"
"5871790","5877950"," down today probably down tomorrow probably down and then we'll find some kind of a viable dip"
"5877950","5886450"," unless we see acceleration in price more than likely just looking for a dip by I"
"5886450","5892010"," don't think we go up from here or nothing's showing me yet they were going up from here at least"
"5892010","5898570"," now there's one other option here I should have put on there and that would be where we trade"
"5898570","5903390"," sideways at the bull if the bears don't get some acceleration to the downside if the bears can't"
"5903390","5909830"," find real selling in here it is possible this is actually the second most post or most most"
"5909830","5919690"," probable the second most probable outcome here is there you'll learn"
"5919690","5929430"," here let me let me mute this real quick so the second most most probable outcome"
"5929430","5935210"," here is going to be so we've got what says Wednesday Thursday and Friday right"
"5935210","5945070"," to just on a 15 minute here same as probable outcome is going to be"
"5945070","5952970"," just trading sideways until we find that support so you've got this little bit of support right"
"5952970","5960800"," here we'll leave this for the next few days and this is where real door we'll find a real demand"
"5960800","5970690"," is hold on here hold on here and you can see where it is right right down here"
"5970690","5979190"," it's kind of pushed it up push it up went did a leg higher trying to find some acceptance so"
"5979190","5988350"," this would be the next the next support for the bulls down here and then we know if we break"
"5988350","5998260"," below this true price range here we're heading much lower to range somewhere in"

"6490080","6496320"," to the covid crash there's already talk of a market rolling over you can actually see momentum"
"6496320","6503980"," going down one last trip higher and then bloodbath now that was covid right that did this whether"
"6503980","6509440"," you believe in covid or not doesn't matter they did shut down our government they shut down so this"
"6509440","6519260"," is like an ad not for an anomaly right why we blasted straight through here in effect this sped up"
"6519260","6523200"," what should have happened right this should have taken place over time and said it was just a"
"6523200","6527880"," straight blast down but this is kind of neat right so what we'll do is we're gonna look at the"
"6527880","6534440"," rest of velocity over here just currently right now and if you look right here right you see this"
"6534440","6543020"," declining velocity here and I'll snap a little line for you to take a look at it so you can"
"6543020","6549140"," actually see where we started decline of velocity and we continue to decline of velocity continue"
"6549140","6557140"," to decline this is kind of predicting the market rolling over before it happens right seeing the"
"6557140","6563120"," market rollover in real time and not only that even though price comes higher here we come back"
"6563120","6570040"," down right and we're actually squeezing you see the squeeze here the bear market rally remember"
"6570040","6576280"," bear market rally see that bear market rally right there right and what is happening while we're"
"6576280","6582480"," having a bear market rally velocity is still going down you see what I'm saying rip higher bear"
"6582480","6588800"," market rally right price still leading down momentum going down and you can actually see a momentum"
"6588800","6596060"," shift right you can start to see dips buying bottom here right this is then summertime we're like"
"6596060","6600800"," oh the bear market rally might be over still below the zero line though right so still a bear"
"6600800","6609000"," market rally right down here still kind of a bear market rally down here unconfirmed little peak"
"6609000","6616300"," above up here right poked our heads up above down here we're still losing momentum right but here's"
"6616300","6623140"," the key difference you can see it right here right you can see it right there that's that first"
"6623140","6631500"," check and you're seeing it start to happen again right so if we start to see price trade sideways"
"6631500","6638840"," and yet momentum come underneath right that's a signal for us that we're gonna start blasting down"
"6638840","6644540"," but we're not seeing that yet are we so that's why that's my only question you'd have to have some"
"6644540","6651860"," kind of an event where you know we're like straight down here with a bar that would have to be"
"6651860","6659520"," like a COVID event it's not an event like event like cut rates would do that but outside of"
"6659520","6669420"," something like that normally you'll see declining momentum on the on the spot we're just not"
"6669420","6675980"," seeing that yet so unless you get some kind of a wild-ass event something unexpected that we don't"
"6675980","6685720"," see like we're closing down society I don't know a war of some kind something like that like we"
"6685720","6692640"," know we had Jay Powell the other day say we might need more rate cuts he kind of like rug"
"6692640","6697900"," pulled an unknown event right he told"
"6697900","6707680"," us before he'd guess I point to you it be if it's an if it's a known"
"6707680","6716340"," event you'd likely begin to see momentum trail off as price is going to head down to three thousand"
"6716340","6725220"," you wouldn't see momentum rising right now we are seeing momentum rise right now so you I guess if"
"6725220","6734560"," you're a collapsed kind of a bear at this point your argument has to be a fundamental"
"6734560","6743360"," shift in Fed policy which we had at the Fed rate decision right he said"
"6743360","6750840"," Jerome Powell said we might need to do more rate hikes and then his little Fed presidents have said"
"6750840","6757340"," the same thing for the past couple weeks and then yesterday while he was or two days ago when he"
"6757340","6762920"," was giggling yesterday was yesterday Jesus Christ I haven't slept in like 40 I don't know it's 48"
"6762920","6770080"," hours I'm trying to get this computer shit worked out but he's intentionally this is the grossest"
"6770080","6778780"," part right he's intentionally in his own way instituted some kind of a Fed put right like a like a"
"6778780","6785660"," backdoor Fed put on the market by saying we're not done with rate hikes and so now you're like oh"
"6785660","6792980"," shit he's not gonna pivot or if this isn't our last Fed rate hike the timing is wrong right we"
"6792980","6797280"," have to sell that news we have to sell a pause we have to sell a pivot we have to"
"6797280","6804120"," sell the end of rate hikes if he announces that we're stopping rate hikes that means he's done his"
"6804120","6808960"," job and broken something right so right now he's basically saying no we're pushing the recession"
"6808960","6813580"," off right now we're not gonna declare recession today we're gonna wait we haven't broken anything"
"6813580","6821120"," yet the living record is strong so the moment they do he does something like that we don't have"
"6821120","6828820"," like a known event it's been pushed off right to sell the market so you what you're looking for if"
"6828820","6835500"," you're a collapse bear my my assumption is here momentum is still strong in the market like prices"
"6835500","6840200"," and still going up like the fools they always have a dumb money smart money in reality the smart"
"6840200","6845760"," money is buying this market the dumb retail money is not this is very smart it's not the bank money"
"6845760","6850140"," they're the big elephant but the hedge funds are buying this market the hedge funds are buying this"
"6850140","6856120"," market they're driving it up and probably that statement yesterday was geared towards those people"
"6856120","6860540"," and they wanted to hear it over and over it was probably a backroom meeting where someone from some"
"6860540","6865260"," had huge hedge funds said I want you to say it I want you to say it publicly at that"
"6865260","6873700"," mean like 10 times which is kind of gross yeah the only other thing I think of it be like"
"6873700","6879520"," you I've heard people say like the credit credit event right yeah I think if that's a valid"
"6879520","6884040"," statement you have to have something that's unknown at this point for us to start plunging to the"
"6884040","6891380"," depths of hell I think you do think you're a collapse bear thank you for Michael Barry I think"
"6891380","6899760"," Michael Barry is truly on Michael Barry's where Michael Barry said sell my assumption is that Barry"
"6899760","6904460"," thought that there would be some kind of an announcement I thought there would be an announcement"
"6904460","6912500"," I've been waiting for a fed pivot or a fed kind of a fed pivot or pause and rates myself"
"6912500","6917920"," as well right because that would signal sell the market and I think even in that meeting yesterday"
"6917920","6922960"," Barry's out there more than likely going that's all about the verbiage that he uses the words that"
"6922960","6928640"," he uses the moment that Jay Powell is out there telling you craziness like when would Jay Powell is"
"6928640","6934240"," out there telling you craziness like yeah we have to do more rate cuts or rate increases that's the"
"6934240","6942660"," shit that a bear doesn't want to hear the bears just historically historical precedence says you"
"6942660","6948160"," don't want to hear that even if people are like the vocal or vote when Volcker was in power the"
"6948160","6955160"," market went down it didn't it actually went up it ground higher until they cut rates it just kept"
"6955160","6961100"," grinding sideways and up sideways and up and the yield curve works but doesn't fully work you want"
"6961100","6967260"," to see like rate cuts the yield inversion bounce and start trading higher unemployment be high all"
"6967260","6973640"," these perfect things and perfect balance Jay Powell even said yesterday you know we're unemployment"
"6973640","6980000"," is strong what are we gonna do here right so not none of these mechanics are lining up right now"
"6980000","6986560"," for that collapse kind of a thing I guess I guess you can hope for the collapse like if you're"
"6986560","6991300"," like that 20% it's like yeah we're gonna collapse the good thing for you is if you're a collapse"
"6991300","6999680"," bear is that puts her dirt cheap it's the perfect time right now to buy some of those collapse 10"
"6999680","7005800"," cent puts that are six months or a year out because they're dirt cheap they're dirt cheap and you"
"7005800","7018940"," can probably add them again in three months you can add them again in three months yeah each"
"7018940","7022720"," rain is short to say it'll be a geopolitical event yeah it's got to be some kind of like unknown"
"7022720","7027620"," news something that's not priced in I see people in social media they'll be like the recession's"
"7027620","7033820"," not priced in I'm like it is priced in you can you there's only is either an unknown event that"
"7033820","7040720"," the banks don't know about or the banks already have a plan for when we saw the market when we"
"7040720","7046400"," buy the market on known events we even if you don't know them they know them it was very key"
"7046400","7051560"," man yesterday and yesterday in that in that in that meeting yesterday or that once you know the"
"7051560","7060260"," economic uh a luncheon that they had or whatever they were harping harping on the labor market and"
"7060260","7064760"," they were harping on we might need to like it's crazy over the thinking about thinking about shit"
"7064760","7070620"," he was basically saying we're thinking about thinking about more rate cuts that blew my mind seeing"
"7070620","7077040"," that she says like man like they're doing it they've pretty much they've pretty much have slapped a"
"7077040","7084760"," Fed put in the market for right now we're not gonna see 3000 like next week and I truly believe"
"7084760","7093280"," at that at that rate decision had they said you know we've got one more left that's the last word"
"7093280","7098780"," doing the moment they said that that shit was on you probably would have seen it squeeze up and"
"7098780","7108490"," then a blast to hell like USC 3000 look at a split we would have seen it look at a"
"7108490","7115440"," split we would have plunged the depths of hell and you should keep your eyes on that too if you're"
"7115440","7122600"," a collapsed bear you're waiting for remember we set like the change in in the change in tone the"
"7122600","7130220"," change in direction any kind of change in verbiage now you're gonna be looking for that change from"
"7130220","7136620"," yeah we're thinking about more rate cuts to this is the last one we're pivoting I promise you we're"
"7136620","7146630"," gonna well we're not promise probably like an 80% 70% chance that we blast down yeah"
"7148830","7155810"," I mean I did I showed you guys I showed you guys I posted on at Captain's Alpha or somewhere"
"7155810","7164130"," I posted on at Captain's Alpha or Finn or or Captain Jim James we had four P's down to 16"
"7164130","7173350"," or something right that's pretty low for for some kind of a bull run 16 and I posted another chart"
"7173350","7180610"," on Finn to it about a channos and I'm like these guys you've got all these old guys you got"
"7180610","7188530"," always like fucking 80 year old white men white fat billionaires that you're trying to trust you're"
"7188530","7196070"," like you and I are plebs we're nothing we're like the smallest peep we're like we're like shit on"
"7196070","7206010"," their heel with a shit on the on the heel of a billionaire that's out there telling you like that"
"7206010","7213710"," this one moment in their life right there like I've come to I've come to Jesus or whatever I've"
"7213710","7223110"," come to the spaghetti monster and now I want to see peep ratios down to 14 and 10 and"
"7223110","7229230"," 9 and I'm like well let's go back and look historically and see if they've ever done that sure then"
"7229230","7236890"," shit even before these guys started trading and investing when they were kids their predecessors"
"7236890","7245630"," stopped buying at 9 on bottoms and they were buying at 10 then 11 then 12 then 13 then 14"
"7245630","7254430"," then 15 then 16 so so you're talking two generations ago they didn't do that shit and so now all"
"7254430","7261590"," of a sudden this one time this is it well if you look on a 4pe ratio chart I already"
"7261590","7268590"," posted on Finn to it they bought this one they bought this one these old rich billionaires they"
"7268590","7276610"," bought it they put some risk on they bought it and they're telling you not to so that they're not"
"7276610","7280970"," gonna cut away some fat old rich billionaires not gonna come out make gasoline March features that"
"7280970","7290710"," let two dollars and 46 a gallon there's a story there's a story right in the beginning of a"
"7290710","7298670"," hedge fund market with the crude March features said let's $78 47 a barrel that is up $1.33 or"
"7298670","7304650"," one spot to 7 2% there's a story right in the beginning of hedge fund market wizards where it"
"7304650","7314170"," talks about the price of commodities right and how you've got wild-ass pricing all over the place"
"7314170","7320490"," and then like the king or something I don't recall exactly how it went but basically the king goes"
"7320490","7327150"," out and says no no no no we're not doing that everybody pays the same price now makes diesel much"
"7327150","7334870"," features settling at $2.89 it's like everybody pays the same price or whatever but eventually the"
"7334870","7341310"," king takes those price controls off and we get more wild-ass pricing and like the gesture or"
"7341310","7347510"," somebody goes around and he knows that you've got like a bushel of wheat for five cents and he"
"7347510","7353350"," knows that it's gonna skyrocket in this place not make natural gas dollar because that means you"
"7353350","7360070"," don't know what you're not and so the king comes back and regulates pricing so of course the jester"
"7360070","7366390"," sends his buddies out there and they make bank and that's kind of what's happening right now it's"
"7366390","7370130"," kind of what happening right now before the government comes back and slaps it all back down"
"7370130","7378350"," there's someone on the inside that court jester knows that before the Fed comes back and slaps the"
"7378350","7392140"," price down they have an opportunity to make bank on a bottom and that's what they're doing yeah"
"7392140","7397440"," I've never read hedge fund market wizards but if any of you guys have read it read the first"
"7397440","7404700"," fucking the first like 20 pages right there is exactly what's place in in October and December"
"7404700","7413180"," exactly it's the exact same it might be part of that passage comes from from"
"7413180","7420800"," what do you call it the stock operator book the I've got it on the shelf over many many moons"
"7420800","7429600"," ago still true holds true today which is mind-blowing"
"7433280","7439560"," CPA CPI I don't know if that's a big event I think if you're a collapsed bear you're waiting for"
"7439560","7447220"," either unknown event or you're waiting for a policy shift from the Fed if you if you're not waiting"
"7447220","7453020"," for the policy shift in the Fed for like a big event you're looking for them to front run it"
"7453020","7462440"," so if we get our next rate hike and you maybe you want to front run some hedging there something"
"7462440","7466260"," like that and see if he changes his language I guess you could front run it by a month to"
"7466260","7475680"," three months I think that's possible but currently it it seems like they're pushing out the it"
"7475680","7483600"," seems to me like they're pushing it out to at least late 2023 if I had to guess there is"
"7483600","7487360"," a matter of fact I was looking at I was with a close friend of the program was looking with"
"7487360","7495740"," ball whiz one night at hey clean how do we short the market on shit nobody's in for like 2025"
"7495740","7504580"," 2024 2025 somewhere in there where everyone's not loaded to the tits on I shouldn't have said that"
"7504580","7513740"," oops everyone's not loaded up on on bearishness into like everybody's everybody's got like you you"
"7513740","7522080"," guys haven't seen it but there's like tons of puts for March and June like SPX inspired just loaded"
"7522080","7528800"," with put out with doom put options so I'm like now we gotta get something out there in like 2024"
"7528800","7549170"," 2025 and then just get click the premium on that shit once everybody loads up on that stuff think"
"7549170","7591060"," tight right here yeah puts"
"7591060","7596660"," are cheap I can't chase I can't say no to you like if you are loading up on puts right"
"7596660","7602260"," now they're dirt cheap even if they burn it doesn't matter just the part cost of doing business I"
"7602260","7607980"," get I understand buying puts here I understand buying them like for the next three months buying"
"7607980","7619150"," them again they're dirt cheap absolutely dirt cheap right now you guys"
"7619150","7625530"," want to talk about the JPM caller we can you ready let's talk about JPM caller absolutely we'll"
"7625530","7635070"," talk about the JPM caller oh let's look at almost we'll just we'll do the test and then we'll do"
"7635070","7642590"," a JPM caller so you guys have a better understanding the mechanics of it the simplified we'll give"
"7642590","7650850"," it we'll do that the the dumb trader we'll do the dumb trader I like being the dumb trader at"
"7650850","7665030"," least I should say that we'll do the dumb trader let's see one day we'll"
"7665030","7671250"," do the dumb trader understanding of so let's look at let's look at s let's take a look here at"
"7671250","7682830"," Tesla so we'll do the one-hour chart here and"
"7682830","7692550"," what Tesla gang needs so Tesla broke above it's trigger right"
"7692550","7702710"," here it's next target above is"
"7702710","7710430"," uh two twenty one forty nine it likely won't trade directly to that price you'll likely see Tesla"
"7710430","7720130"," come up here and attempt to get to this 220 with that being said you'll see this green bar"
"7720130","7728410"," we'll check this every day for you as long as Tesla retests here and it's green bar it's still good"
"7728410","7736570"," to go to this 220 220 ish 224 if Tesla can break above I don't think that it will I"
"7736570","7744430"," think it'll reject the first time the real scary part is above right here this could be a massive"
"7744430","7750710"," massive bull trap above and I'll explain this to you later but for right now the basics that you"
"7750710","7759590"," need to know is if Tesla can get above and hold this 220 it would confirm that a corrective action"
"7759590","7767090"," on Tesla is over and done with for right now so you would see the correction over this the orange"
"7767090","7774590"," line that you see would confirm the correction being over on Tesla you should expect a price target"
"7774590","7780310"," still above as soon as we get above 196 you should see a price target above of that two it's"
"7780310","7787830"," uh right now it's currently 221-24 and you'd be wanting to buy dips down here at recurrently a $1 "
"7787830","7797730",".97.85 a $0.09 a barrel which"
"7797730","7804430"," is 117 if you do see a failure here let's say we lose velocity here come back down and break"
"7804430","7810070"," underneath this would be really bad for for bulls this would just be confirming that the bear"
"7810690","7819010"," correction is not over here this is very bad so bulls need to stay or need to need to stay"
"7819010","7827630"," above 196 and try to attack this 200 it's 220 right now it could come down to like 216-219"
"7827630","7836450"," somewhere in there but the real key for bulls here is they want to see they want to see if"
"7836450","7843570"," this comes down like this bulls really really really really really want to trade above hold this"
"7843570","7852510"," and begin new price discovery on high this would confirm the end of the corrective action a trade"
"7852510","7861810"," above let's say 216-220 or a hold above 216-220 would would end the corrective trade on Tesla"
"7861810","7870950"," let me see if I can show you this on a better time frame here and you would see"
"7870950","7880880"," a resumption for Tesla if you can see that that happens here we"
"7880880","7886120"," move up we're going to start to go up and start to attack these highs at 310 and stuff like"
"7886120","7893300"," that this is a pretty big move ahead right here the one concern here is that you will see at"
"7893300","7900800"," some point sellers attempt to come in here and sell this down they don't want to see price go from"
"7900800","7910460"," 220 to these highs above here at 330 so just keep that in mind this is actually the largest part"
"7910460","7918040"," of this trade right here a big monster move to go higher you should have to disclose to you that"
"7918040","7927220"," i am long test the stock and i will be buying puts again once again right as we get up"
"7927220","7935480"," into this 218-219 i don't want to see any kind of a huge rejection here and start smashing levels"
"7935480","7941120"," and getting down to like 95 or 65 of that kind of stuff you start to see something like this"
"7941120","7948440"," make sure that you have some kind of hedging you don't want to see anything like that right there"
"7948440","7955760"," that would be really really bad right there and this will we'll start breaking you start seeing"
"7955760","7961530"," major selling coming in right here we'll blast through these levels so pay attention up here at"
"7961530","7968610"," this 220 if you were going to start to cut yourself cut yourself another option would be would be"
"7968610","7974990"," take profit on your longs on tesla here and then wait you like cut your longs here that's how you"
"7974990","7981370"," get out of like 196 you probably see that happening as well people selling out and then they're"
"7981370","7987930"," going to be looking for price to go above right here and then they would pick the long tesla trade"
"7987930","7995230"," up again somewhere in here right so if you sell your tesla stock as we head up to this 220"
"7995230","8001850"," you wait to you will definitely get an initial telling you're initially going to get people taking"
"8001850","8007090"," profit on long-stack tesla stock and allowing more people to push up so you could take money here"
"8007090","8016110"," at like 196 and then not 196 excuse me and I keep saying 196 I mean 216 you could take"
"8016110","8024530"," profit like 216 wait for price to hold above 220 then you'd re-enter long on tesla stock above up"
"8024530","8031710"," here right so you could do there's a bunch of ways you can do this I don't particularly sell calls"
"8031710","8039090"," on tesla but if you wanted to you could sell some calls as we head up into this 216 area"
"8039090","8047050"," to fund yourself or you could be selling puts once we get above the 220 and hold it but our"
"8047050","8053630"," target above is 220 much more to worry about right now we don't normally hit this exact so I would"
"8053630","8062570"," expect some selling to commit around 216 on tesla uh next thing we're going to look at is um any"
"8062570","8072530"," one second here next thing we're going to look at is uh SPX we're going to talk about"
"8072530","8084630"," the JPM caller and I'll show you guys the JPM caller here and hold on here I"

"8105390","8115360"," people that follow it but are banks that follow it um it's impact on the market"
"8115360","8120200"," we'll just be brief here I've gone over this like ad nauseum at this point in the channel and uh"
"8120200","8124600"," so we're just going to keep it brief I'm not going to explain all the mechanics of it I'll give"
"8124600","8135540"," you an easy idea of the mechanics of it and"
"8135540","8140720"," it's rolling the market so just briefly if you're let's say you open up the let's say I open up"
"8140720","8150220"," cabbage and james pension fund I want my pension fund to give I want my pension fund to give"
"8150220","8160120"," um consistently turns every year so I want my I"
"8160120","8169500"," want my pension fund to hands down give um consistent funds I want some stability I don't want"
"8169500","8173940"," volatility in the market I want to present to pension fund plan to you I'm like oh get captain"
"8173940","8180760"," james captain james pension fund this month we made 10 percent next month we made 20 and we made 15"
"8180760","8185240"," 17 then we had a banner month or a year we could be by the year by the month doesn't"
"8185240","8193080"," matter uh one year out of 10 years I had one bad year was pretty consistent so these big"
"8193080","8198980"," institutions these big banks they want to limit volatility in the market so they can give"
"8198980","8205580"," consistent returns if you had true price discovery let's say on tesla tesla would be wild right it"
"8205580","8210500"," would swing it would scream higher and then there wouldn't be enough fires that could afford it so"
"8210500","8216719"," it's scream back down right you'd see all kinds of nonsense we'd throw a throw a piston here and"
"8216719","8223000"," right and blow up our stock market it would explode we'd have a big big implosion right big kind of"
"8223000","8227500"," a nuclear explosion in the stock market and our stock market wouldn't function so there's a reason"
"8227500","8233080"," for hedging banks financial institutions their playground and they try to limit volatility within"
"8233080","8239020"," the market now they don't always get to control volatility this brings us back to unknown events"
"8239020","8245700"," especially if they don't see it coming right or they're being too greedy we've got i think it's the"
"8245700","8255680"," 3060 somewhere down here i think it's 3060 3060 right here right there let's say it's"
"8255680","8265620"," right there okay for for shits and giggles we got 3660 i believe this is the other one somewhere"
"8265620","8273080"," in there and then we got another one 4060 i think it is i could be wrong on that but"
"8273080","8282680"," i think that's where it is right now where it is right there okay so they need to"
"8282680","8290120"," fund or not need to they wound up funding their their puts right their put spreads uh so we paid"
"8290120","8298639"," put spreads above right paid them and now all they want to happen here all they need for it to"
"8298639","8304040"," happen so that they've got now they've got three puts right we know that they've got three puts so"
"8304040","8313860"," we've got march 31st right here they bought their free puts now jpm doesn't care"
"8313860","8322500"," if we go higher they don't care if we trade higher their market hedge though limits us blasting off"
"8322500","8328580"," to all-time highs or acts like a acts like because we got a magnet down below here right eight "
"8328580","8336160","-time bulls lose eight-time bulls lose uh strength in the market there's a little magnet down here"
"8336760","8343260"," that's gonna want to uh i would say like it's that's when you hear like the term melt up it"
"8343260","8347820"," feels the market hedging that's on the market so what you'll see is well grind grind grind grind"
"8347820","8352840"," grind bulls lose momentum we'll start pulling back down pulling back down pulling back down we'll"
"8352840","8358139"," start going yeah yeah we're bullish here grind back down grind back down grind back down and the"
"8358139","8363559"," reality is they don't care if we trade down to the depths of hell they don't even care if we"
"8363559","8371200"," trade down to 3600 at this point the only thing that they care about is that we close down below"
"8371200","8377900"," this four zero six four by the 31st that's all they care about they've made their money they have"
"8377900","8385000"," their free puts they've had a pretty decent return for q1 and they've limited the craziness in the"
"8385000","8390040"," market right so they've killed all these birds with this one stone so in reality if we trade up"
"8390040","8395060"," higher we got the 430 even if we get the 460 as long as that magnets down there and now"
"8395060","8400560"," that those puts are so cheap we should at some point try to monetize those if they're like one"
"8400560","8406180"," penny three pennies ten pennies twenty cents because there's that high concentration towards the"
"8406180","8416120"," end we'll get that we'll end up getting that that jpm print at some point here they'll be"
"8416120","8424260"," happy now if we get real money selling real institutional money selling down here it's bonus time"
"8425580","8431040"," for jpm if we start really blasting through down here it's like triple bonus time everybody's going"
"8431040","8436060"," to the pamptons then we're all heading out to a pizza and we're going to go to Davos to have"
"8436060","8442240"," fun and all that kind of stuff but as far as jpm is concerned they've already won the first first"
"8442240","8448280"," half of their trade all they really need is that magnet down there's one magnet here and there's"
"8448280","8455480"," another magnet down below over here and all they need is for bulls to yeah we got 430 yeah we"
"8455480","8462680"," got 460 and then we trade below for the 31st there is a high probability of us no matter where"
"8462680","8471980"," we trade that at a minimum we will trade below this four zero six zero on march 31st i'm not"
"8471980","8477020"," guaranteed but a pretty high probability now at this point we haven't had any real money selling"
"8477020","8484260"," jpau has told us something different so the likelihood of 360 is becoming less apparent and"
"8484260","8491480"," certainly 3065 unless they can create some shit unless both or some unknown news comes out there's"
"8491480","8496020"," a high probability of us now no matter how high we go that we trade back down into here it"
"8496020","8502320"," looks kind of right doesn't it something like that right maybe we blast down here for a minute and"
"8502320","8508520"," tag this here that's possibility but the high probability trade is right there this is the second"
"8508520","8515340"," high probability trade at this point um but you just you guys already see it week and of february"
"8515340","8521060"," come down here maybe trade back up you can actually see it you can actually see the jpm car in"
"8521060","8529780"," real time right here right um just snap a quick line right here and right there"
"8529780","8537280"," when this is the path of the jpm car at this point right come back down trade back up bears"
"8537280","8544720"," are like hell no we're going down to that 360 and then we'll pin back up here actually we don't"
"8545220","8551040"," pin right there we can trade up here and then send it right back down into it um bears are"
"8551040","8556820"," like now we're going down to the depths of hell into march 17th i don't see that as probably i"
"8556820","8565440"," see these two as being the probable conclusions to the jpm caller at this point now they have a"
"8565440","8572100"," free trade do they care if it prints or not they don't uh a great example a great example of"
"8572100","8581160"," their um them not getting the print or the closing price down below like 3000 or 3600 uh september"
"8581160","8589900"," 2021 you can look that one up september 2021 we blasted down the 36th row not 3600 at all price"
"8589900","8595840"," was then but i can't stop everywhere but we blasted down you can actually see i'll show it to you"
"8595840","8605840"," right here bring it back up for you if you look right here uh this"
"8605840","8615540"," is um 31st right here and i can go back and on your own time and just look up um"
"8618240","8629560"," for a react right no no no no right there right and just look at this we"
"8629560","8634660"," end up blasting all the way up right couple dips down just kept on grinding higher grinding higher"
"8634660","8644240"," grinding higher they have their free puts right here right markets going up the underlying"
"8644240","8652640"," they're making money on they don't even care right they don't even care um so if you're a huge bear"
"8652640","8658200"," on on the caller uh they paid for their puts if the market goes up from here they don't care"
"8659300","8667300"," we have a likely pin down below at 4060 they would like to see that uh if they don't see"
"8667300","8672980"," that the underlying that they own is going to print they basically their hedge has worked at this"
"8672980","8680800"," point so there's no requirement for us to go down there's no requirement for us to um to trade to"
"8680800","8690220"," 3060 now now we just need to see some real money selling in the market for that to happen i'm"

"8981900","8990020"," price over 314 you'd see five bucks we saw that we blasted through came back down retested um and"
"8990020","8996420"," then you're looking to hold five bucks right so that you can go up and try to tag this uh"
"8996420","9002960"," this 12 dollar mark above and what you can see is that that did not happen right now there was"
"9002960","9009440"," an opportunity to unfuck yourself uh if you were unfuck yourself on the underline if you had time"
"9009440","9016360"," then we're going to look at that real quick and show you how you had some you had the chance"

"9046220","9052680"," five dollars right we start trading down right here so even if you had missed the first blast below"
"9052680","9058180"," five the moment we triggered that you could see that we rejected above and started to sell back"
"9058180","9063720"," down the moment we're right here boom trades over right come back down find some support we start"
"9063720","9074210"," getting sold on the one in the five minute rejection on the one in five minute more rejection right"
"9074210","9084150"," one minute five minute more rejection more rejection and you can see looking back in time"
"9084150","9089870"," you see down here velocity right is growing to the downside now you want to see where your big dips"
"9089870","9095090"," are in this market if you're looking for big dips to buy in this market we're not there yet are"
"9095090","9100530"," we right get another one right here you got another one right here we're not quite there yet down"

"9107570","9117550"," see the through this one right here so i'm really looking"
"9117550","9125510"," for a retest probably of 209 to pitch late for me personally um if you wanted to see this is"
"9125510","9131190"," so this is a price target down below uh let me put a little price target down here are you"
"9131190","9136170"," not going to want to see this that's what i'm looking for like two dollars nine cents something"
"9136170","9142290"," like that now you're like eh cap uh you know what you're talking about okay so we'll look back"
"9142290","9150670"," right here and you see this rip right here on February 3rd right see how price came above the one"
"9150670","9156090"," five minute i believe that was the daily trigger uh right in here retested it started launching"
"9156090","9160990"," right uh you see where this red line is right here and this white line right here and now you"
"9160990","9165430"," have this big blue line your oh this big light blue line you're under see how we're not above that"
"9165430","9173230"," blue line we're below it right you see where below it see how we're below this blue line price is"

"9195350","9200810"," red line to get higher and then you're also looking for this green line believe it or not to get"
"9200810","9205170"," underneath right all these confluence is coming down right here and then you're actually looking"
"9205170","9212570"," for price price to trade above all these and boom that's where you get your next your next trade"
"9212570","9217330"," and this is where you take the trade you know i'm sitting the trade down here you don't fuck around"
"9217330","9223610"," down here until you get price lower you wait for the setup to take the trade so is that setup"
"9223610","9229110"," here yet no we know it's not here we know the setup's not here we know we're not above the"
"9229110","9234270"," blue line the green line the red line the white line right we know we're not uh can you take"
"9234270","9240630"," a small squeeze trade above from here to here sure uh but are we trading above the one five minute"
"9240630","9249410"," trigger right now let's look are we fuck no right you this looks like to me like a classic sell"
"9249410","9259310"," the rip blast down try to escape the one in five minute sellers come right in no right come right"
"9259310","9266050"," as a classic bull trap come right down here sellers come right back in no find weakness and we"
"9266050","9272670"," start blasting down now you're like okay should i take a trade here cap no you you can't this bull"
"9272670","9280790"," you can't as a bull you need to see confirmation right you want to see the red line going there"
"9280790","9290640"," you need to see the white line coming up and you need to see price begin to hold so price"
"9290640","9300580"," need to come up hold on a second price needs to come up right see how"
"9300580","9310500"," it hasn't rejected make a new high confirm the trade higher and that's where you jump in right"
"9310500","9320180"," there right and even then when you do that that's what what is that 265 270 280 or something you're"
"9320180","9327800"," then only good to like 310 you've got more sellers above here um so do i think and you see"
"9327800","9333840"," momentum is on the downside right so you're not seeing watch these bars down here you're not seeing"
"9334680","9342500"," these bars currently even if price is lower so let's say price let's pretend that price is down"
"9342500","9352180"," here right let's say price is bleeding off down here but you start to see momentum turning up right"
"9352180","9359780"," you see another white bar right here right see another white bar right here right and you start to"
"9359780","9366840"," see like these lows not really not kind of like slowing down right and these bars are here i'd be"
"9366840","9370720"," like hell yeah it's a bottom the buy we could probably buy this bottom right here we're not seeing"
"9370720","9377520"," that yet you can see the slope downward still still in a downward slope on BBY so do i think"
"9377520","9382800"," you should buy BBY here no people will say to me uh what about if i just buy BBY and"
"9382800","9388340"," hold it until it does squeeze what if it only squeezes from a dollar 60 to three dollars there's"
"9388340","9393960"," your hundred percent trade right there on your upside down so uh what if a Tesla starts to scream"
"9393960","9400080"," higher tomorrow and you're locked into BBY let's Tesla do it today let's say you bought the dip in"
"9400080","9407320"," and BBY now you got 30 grand locked in the BBY hasn't come back yet what's Tesla doing Tesla's"
