"hyTBo-cFYKU","0","17600"," Check one two, mic check."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","17600","21600"," See is everything on?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","21600","25600"," Look at some."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","47600","51600"," See that?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","51600","55600"," Let's go."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","77600","93600"," Good morning."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","93600","95600"," Good morning."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","95600","97600"," Arthur Solom."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","97600","99600"," What's going on?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","99600","101600"," Stacey, good morning."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","101600","105600"," Keep your eyes on a 3.30 this afternoon."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","106600","109600"," It's a 3.07 right now hour of power."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","109600","121600"," So I'm going to talk to you guys about what to expect the next 3-4 days here into Friday."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","121600","125600"," Ball is in Sellers Corner here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","125600","129600"," So this is the 29th right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","135600","145600"," If you are a seller, as long as you stay below 4.29.87,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","145600","147600"," I've got two targets for you to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","147600","151600"," First one's going to be 4.20.87."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","151600","155600"," This is your first target right here into tomorrow,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","155600","160600"," and Thursday, and likely into Friday the 4.16.84."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","160600","162600"," This is spy specific."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","162600","168600"," This is not."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","168600","184600"," This is not SPX, but just here into tomorrow."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","184600","190600"," So just so I just want to pay attention to this right here unless."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","191600","193600"," Change this to wait."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","193600","198600"," Any kind of squeezing to the upside, expect it to be sold to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","198600","204600"," Thursday, price target 4.20.87, Friday price target 4.16.84."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","204600","206600"," Into end of month, end of quarter."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","206600","208600"," Could be quicker than that."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","208600","212600"," I'm going to show you really quick."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","212600","217600"," A little bit of a squeeze here in Spy right now."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","217600","218600"," Watch this from above."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","218600","220600"," Bull's failed, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","220600","222600"," Bull's failed right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","222600","225600"," Didn't even get the chance to sell this to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","225600","227600"," It was just boom, saw you down."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","227600","228600"," Nobody's nobody's big."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","228600","229600"," No big deal."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","229600","231600"," Doesn't mean anything, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","231600","235600"," And so any I want you to see this hourly trigger here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","235600","239600"," This is just about to cross the weekly trigger."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","239600","242600"," You're going to see this cross down overnight."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","242600","246600"," And then into tomorrow, and you're likely going to see that rejection."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","246600","252600"," At some point here tomorrow and into Wednesday and Thursday."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","252600","256600"," If you are a bull, you've got no trade unless you're above the weekly trigger."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","256600","260600"," Just another springboard here for sellers to come in and sell the market."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","260600","263600"," You'll have intraday trades that you can take."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","263600","265600"," Like you can take a trade like this."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","265600","269600"," From here to here, you can take this trade right here and this trade right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","269600","275600"," But even so, you are looking at a major, major downside move."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","275600","277600"," Coming your way."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","277600","280600"," You also have a four hour."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","280600","285600"," You have a four hour rollover bear."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","285600","288600"," Or excuse me, bear cross on the four hour and SPX."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","288600","294600"," That should last either price or time to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","294600","300600"," Major downside moves to come in SPX for a sustained period."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","300600","303600"," So if you're a bull and you're looking for some relief."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","303600","308600"," You got it in here, but at the same time it's positionally to get short."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","308600","312600"," Right there, get short right there and get short right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","312600","319600"," And by morning, by morning tomorrow that hourly trigger should roll down."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","319600","325600"," And you should be waking up with that hourly trigger somewhere down in here to even sell down even farther."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","325600","333600"," So expect more pain to come unless we trade currently trade above $429.87."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","333600","336600"," No trade above this $429.87, no holding."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","336600","340600"," And even if you do, let's say you got to squeeze up here, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","340600","343600"," Say the market squeezes, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","343600","349600"," If you don't hold that hourly, it's just another springboard to the downside over here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","349600","354600"," So you need not only do you need to break above the weekly trigger, but you need to hold it"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","354600","359600"," and begin to make your way higher for this correction to be over currently right now."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","359600","363600"," Bulls giving it up, giving it up at 1.30 this afternoon."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","363600","366600"," This was the deal breaker right here for bulls."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","366600","369600"," As soon as they broke that up, as soon as they broke this right here,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","369600","373600"," you've now got the, you've got the young Jim bros that are sitting right here"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","373600","376600"," and they want nothing more than to sell this down."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","376600","382600"," And you've got the big boys right here waiting for you to sell the market down into Friday."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","382600","390600"," Price target into Friday, 4.16 in change for the sellers, 4.16 in change."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","390600","393600"," Unless we break above that 4.30, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","393600","395600"," That's what you've got coming up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","395600","399600"," Flat right now looking to reposition into Friday to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","399600","404600"," Just looking for this squeeze to end and grab some more puts for Friday."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","404600","407600"," Not a good look for buyers."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","407600","411600"," Let's look at SPX really quick and show you exactly what I'm talking about."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","412600","416600"," So just right here, if you want to look at this on a one hour,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","416600","420600"," just so you can see it pounding down right now."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","420600","425600"," You know, you're trying to talk about, you're talking about this right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","425600","429600"," Talking about this right here holding the entire market up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","429600","433600"," I'm going to tell you, fuck you know that shit ain't holding anything up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","433600","437600"," So this right here, you're telling me that this is the entire market."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","437600","439600"," I'm going to say to you, no."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","440600","442600"," It's down here somewhere."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","442600","443600"," You see it?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","443600","445600"," So it's way, way down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","445600","447600"," Just a matter of time."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","447600","451600"," Up here, squeeze this down and blast straight to the depths of hell."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","451600","458600"," This will be your full capitulation move down here into Friday or the first week of the month."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","458600","463600"," I would not expect this to be your place to buy the market."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","463600","465600"," Go along all that kind of shit."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","465600","467600"," It's definitely down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","467600","469600"," I'm going to lead to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","469600","470600"," 416468."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","470600","475600"," No, I'll give you that over here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","475600","482600"," If you're a bull, I'll give you like, I'll give you this is some demand."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","482600","485600"," I'll give you that that is some demand right there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","485600","489600"," But that you're still talking 416468."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","489600","491600"," This is what instigated that move."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","491600","495600"," This instigated that move at 416 4167."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","496600","500600"," They're going to likely give this entire move back to you or close to it."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","500600","503600"," Maybe not at the exact pin strike or something."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","503600","510600"," You can see that you're just waiting on these last little bit in this gap to fill to the downside here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","510600","512600"," We'll actually raise this up a little bit."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","512600","516600"," We'll give you one more point of interest down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","516600","519600"," That's that gap right there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","519600","521600"," We'll write that into gap."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","522600","525600"," That last little point of interest."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","525600","527600"," There's a gap down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","527600","529600"," GAB or GAP."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","529600","532600"," Right down there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","532600","535600"," But the truth is all this shit's going to be given up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","535600","538600"," You're going to give up all this shit down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","538600","542600"," And you're going to be looking for some buyers to come into the market there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","542600","544600"," Until that happens."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","544600","546600"," Extremely fucking bearish."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","546600","548600"," Extremely bearish."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","549600","551600"," On this SPX right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","551600","553600"," You can see where they gave it up, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","553600","555600"," You don't know where they gave it up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","555600","557600"," Let me show it to you."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","557600","558600"," So right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","558600","559600"," Right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","559600","562600"," There's there's known known buyers, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","562600","565600"," Known buyers right there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","565600","570600"," And known buyer or not are assumed assuming that there's known buyers here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","570600","574600"," So they came in and bought it and what they do get the fuck out of here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","574600","575600"," We're out here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","575600","577600"," So they're selling into you, right?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","577600","582600"," They're going to sell into you right there and take you all the way down to where we began"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","582600","583600"," back here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","583600","585600"," So no faith there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","585600","586600"," No faith in the market."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","586600","588600"," No faith in spoos."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","588600","593600"," And if you think that you are going to have faith in spoos, then you need to be up here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","593600","595600"," See what I'm saying?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","595600","598600"," So right up here, you need to see price action up here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","598600","602600"," Knowing that we're actually holding all this up here until that happens."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","603600","608600"," Major downside move coming in spoos into and a month end of quarter."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","608600","612600"," Price target downside or two, one, one, nine, eight."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","612600","613600"," Believe it or not."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","613600","618600"," I'm going to give you what I expect here as being four, one, six, two, nine, six."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","618600","621600"," And on some deep extension."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","621600","623600"," Or 10."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","623600","629600"," Oh, three, ninety eight or consolidation down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","629600","633600"," Talking about horse trading down in this zone of trading down here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","633600","636600"," Not a good look for spoos."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","636600","640600"," Not a good look for spy in no way, shape or form."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","640600","647600"," We'll go back to spy right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","647600","648600"," Zero."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","648600","650600"," Three chit holding up this market here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","650600","651600"," Ain't nothing."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","651600","653600"," You gave it up right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","653600","655600"," You gave it up right back over here on spy."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","656600","664600"," Yeah, I don't care what the font sounds on H Y G there."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","664600","666600"," There's nothing holding this market."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","666600","670600"," There's like, there's like one guy holding this market."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","670600","672600"," This market's going to bloodbath."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","672600","674600"," Karen fucking teed."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","674600","677600"," There ain't yet holding this up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","677600","679600"," Not a goddamn thing."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","679600","682600"," It's not a goddamn thing holding this up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","683600","686600"," Yeah, there's going to be a capitulate."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","686600","688600"," We're coming into a capitulation move."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","688600","690600"," You're going to get the giant capitulation."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","690600","692600"," It's going to be fucking nasty."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","692600","695600"," And it's going to be fucking brutal to the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","695600","696600"," Karen fucking teed."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","696600","698600"," You're getting a fucking flush, man."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","698600","700600"," It ain't going to be pretty."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","700600","701600"," Don't be caught in that."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","701600","703600"," Don't be caught in that flush."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","703600","704600"," When it comes, it could be overnight."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","704600","705600"," It could be tomorrow."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","705600","706600"," It could be during the daytime."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","706600","707600"," They're going to shit this."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","707600","709600"," They're going to shit this market to the depths of hell."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","709600","710600"," Guarantee it."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","710600","711600"," Karen fucking teed."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","711600","713600"," There ain't nothing holding up here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","713600","714600"," Nothing."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","714600","717600"," Vicks now trade $19.11."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","717600","720600"," Apple bloodbathing the clothes right now."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","720600","724600"," There is nothing holding this market up."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","724600","725600"," Not a goddamn thing."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","725600","726600"," Guaranteeed."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","726600","727600"," 423.95 on tap."

"hyTBo-cFYKU","1722040","1726600"," remember how that shit went. Yeah, you might have been somewhere where that wasn't going on, but"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1727560","1734840"," where there was where there was money. That housing crash, even if you held on. So let's say you"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1734840","1739800"," did the right thing. You're like, I did the right thing during the housing crash, right? The big"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1739800","1748840"," one, right? The monster one. That's not how it played out. People were left way, way upside down."

"hyTBo-cFYKU","1754360","1759960"," when it happened. It was it was fucking wild. And there ain't no way this is happening like this."

"hyTBo-cFYKU","1769880","1777080"," Okay, you should know. When some guy like a Fed president shows you a chart from 2030."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1778360","1783400"," That guy is telling you that there is nothing bad that's going to happen between now and then."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1784200","1792920"," We're in 20 fucking 23. We're in 2023. And this guy was showing charts to 2032. Yes, or last week."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1792920","1797400"," And you're telling me that that guy right there knows what's going to happen between now and 2030."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1797400","1804840"," No fucking way. He's out of his mind. He is straight out of his mind, man, straight out of his mind"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1804840","1811720"," telling you guys out of his fucking skull. No, you can fight the Fed. Fed has been wrong. And it's"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1811720","1816840"," usually at the end of a tightening cycle when they're wrong. They are usually wrong when you"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1816840","1821720"," said that don't fight the Fed works until you get to the end of it. Once you get to the end of it,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1821720","1826040"," you're like, Oh, man, too much too much. Don't do that."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1828040","1829640"," Like too much, dude."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1833720","1838120"," And telling you like you like the Fed like the don't fight the Fed is true."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1838840","1844360"," Like the don't fight the Fed is true, but there comes a moment, right? I'm down with going with"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1844360","1850120"," the Fed, but there comes a moment where you go. And I don't know, man, like, let me let me let me"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1850120","1859640"," let me explain it better to you. The Fed could raise rates into December 2025 if they didn't say"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1859720","1868440"," that shit. That was a high probability. It's it's it's it's not that he can't raise rates"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1868440","1873720"," in December 2025. It's how he goes about saying that they're going to do it."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1875240","1878600"," It's projecting that far out. Hey, we're going to do this and we're going to do that and we're"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1878600","1882440"," going to do this and that's what's going to happen. And it's like, ah, you didn't have to do that."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1882440","1887960"," Could have just set higher for longer monitor inflation monitor unemployment."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1888600","1896280"," If you look at a chart for unemployment, we should be fucking at like five to six percent unemployment"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1896280","1902760"," at that point. Historically, if we're at that five or six percent unemployment, the market should"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1902760","1910040"," be on fucking fire. It should be going to the depths of hell at that point. So if the market's"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1910040","1915720"," going to the depths of hell and unemployment is raging, you're not expecting the Fed to be raising"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1915720","1922200"," shit. They ain't raising shit as we do that. That should not happen has not ever happened"

"hyTBo-cFYKU","1936680","1941080"," Ah, they did it. You can go back and listen to that Fed meeting. You can go back and listen to"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1941160","1945400"," that Fed meeting. They were going to raise and hold into December 2024."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1946680","1954920"," December 2024. Go back and watch that Fed meeting. I watched it. I read the transcripts. I read"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1954920","1967480"," everything. You got to go back. Don't I already went back and did my research. I already watched"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1967560","1973000"," it live here. I went back and read the transcripts. Go do it on your own. He's out of his fucking"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1973000","1977080"," mind. I'm going to tell you something. What was the last time you saw? What was the last time you"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1977080","1984200"," saw anyone? You think a Fed chair is going to pull out charts for you for no reason? You think they"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1984200","1987560"," go you think you think that they go to a meeting before they get there and say,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1988200","1995160"," do we do we do charts or not for no motivation? It's over selling that we're going to be higher"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","1995160","2002200"," for longer? I don't think that they are, but they're trying to sell it. We have to sell this"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2002200","2009400"," into December 2024. That's how long we're going to be higher for. It was too much selling of that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2009400","2019720"," thought process. Too much selling. Too much sizzle on the state. Too much sizzle on the state."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2020680","2026600"," If that isn't true, you can even just see what Cash Curry did today. It's like trying to like"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2026600","2029800"," oh shit, we oversold it. We're going to try to pull it back a little bit, rein it back a little bit."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2034760","2044520"," Yeah, the iPad, dude. The fucking iPad. It was the iPad. You're talking about the fucking leader of"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2045080","2052200"," the Fed Reserve. He doesn't have to say shit where he doesn't have to show shit. He just speaks"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2052840","2056760"," and you listen to him. Do you understand? Like when he speaks, you listen to him,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2057720","2061400"," right? But then when they started, when they started all that stuff, I was like, these guys have no"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2061400","2064920"," idea what's going to happen. So looking again, that's something that's going to happen."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2067400","2072120"," There's some straight fin to it, right? They're pulling out the maps, pulling out like the path."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2075320","2081640"," I thought it was hilarious. Bleeding down into the close here, trading 425.02."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2086120","2091160"," Bleeding down into the close here. HYG trying to hold on right now. HYG setting up some kind"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2091160","2097000"," of reversal to the upside. Just looking for another opportunity to get in and sell."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2097880","2104120"," I want to sell that S2 up here. It's the right where this S2 is. If you watch my cursor,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2104840","2109400"," any of this stuff right here, trying to sell that into the downside."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2112680","2120200"," Yeah, I don't see that. I see the market selling. I see the or not selling, but I see the market,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2121080","2130760"," not the market. I see the economy should be in pretty shitty shape by spring, summer of 2024,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2131640","2137400"," somewhere in there. They're doing good work. And you should see destruction. You should see job"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2137400","2143080"," destruction. You should see that stuff as we head into 2024 at some point in spring, summer time."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2143080","2149480"," By the time we get into 2025, it should be pretty. We should be on fire. The economy should be on fire."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2151080","2157960"," If you look at it from that perspective, you're talking about the Fed raising into that and then"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2157960","2164760"," holding into that. Normally, we get that front running of pause and cut before we get to the"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2164760","2173320"," market rolling down and over. If you can't get them to do that, if you can't get the Fed to,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2174200","2180440"," in some way, agree to that. The market will force it on to the Fed, right? The market will sell on"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2180440","2186120"," its own and force the Fed into cutting rates, right? Do you understand what I'm saying with that?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2186120","2191720"," Do you guys look at what he was, the charts that he was showing, you're the same ones that I show"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2191720","2198040"," you here, right? So you're like, I show you those charts on the rate of inflation, the unemployment"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2198120","2204520"," rate on the Fed, the Fed funds rate. And if you're seeing that Fed funds rate being threatened,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2205560","2212040"," much, much higher than the expectation, and it doesn't really match up with the rate of inflation"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2212040","2217960"," with the rate of unemployment with the jobs numbers with GDP, any of that kind of stuff,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2217960","2222200"," it makes you, it makes you wonder, you're like, are they do it? Do they really believe this?"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2222200","2228680"," Or are they just trying to sell that notion that they're going to raise and hold higher for"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2228680","2234600"," longer? And I think that the markets, not think, but the market right now is saying to them,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2235560","2240120"," we don't think you're going to actually be raising rates or even holding rates after you're done"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2240120","2245560"," with a rate cycle. Let's see, put on another 50 BPS, you're going to hold them that deep into"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2246520","2254360"," 2024, December, January of 2025, there'll be no need to hold or raise that that long into the future."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2265080","2270360"," Yeah, they're bent against it. I know that they're betting against it. I realized, I realized that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2270360","2275080"," they're betting against it right now. I realized that they're betting against this right now."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2275160","2281800"," I don't see them raising rates 50 BPS and I don't see them holding them into December 2024."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2281800","2288840"," It was the commentary from the Fed Chair. Please do yourself a favor, go back and watch that Fed"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2288840","2297400"," commentary. Do yourself a solid and see them trying to sell that narrative. Squeezing higher"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2297400","2309960"," right now on spy, trying to maintain 424 81. Yeah, you guys need to go back and"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2309960","2315320"," re you guys need to you guys need to separate a whole bunch of shit here, right? You're arguing"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2315320","2321720"," like you're arguing a bunch of different points that do not mean anything to each other. They're"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2321720","2329560"," all separate points. I'm talking to you about the fed fucking Jerome Powell, trying to sell"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2329560","2339240"," the narrative that he's going to raise 25 to 50 BPS. He's going to hold that into 2024,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2339240","2346760"," December of 2024. And that is just not true in my view. That does not happen. I don't see them"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2346760","2351880"," doing that into that time. And furthermore, you can even see the market betting against that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2351880","2358840"," right now that that is going to be the case. They will be backpedaling when we come into December"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2358840","2368120"," of 2024, which is January point 25. You guys understand what I'm saying to you? I don't think"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2368120","2373080"," you got like, so there's a disagreement here between what the Fed is saying they're going to do."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2373640","2379800"," And what the market is saying is going to happen. So if that is if the market saying to you that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2379800","2385720"," something else is going to happen, right? And they're trying to buy themselves time from that role"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2385720","2390680"," that pause and rolling of rates. So all they had to say was, yeah, we're going to keep raising"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2390680","2396520"," and data dependent, right? They can keep pushing that narrative into the end of the year into"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2396520","2401480"," springtime and into summer. But when they're saying to you, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2401480","2405880"," we're we're we're doing this for like another year and a half, bro, bro. So we're doing it for"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2405880","2412920"," like 15 more months. They're asking you to believe that it's not just fall, winter and spring,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2412920","2417240"," or even summer, they're saying, fuck it, throw another six, six months on there. And you're like,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2417240","2420840"," you didn't have to do that, dude. You don't have to sell it for an extra six fucking months through"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2420840","2426760"," summer of 2024. You just have to say higher for longer. It's that fucking simple. Does that make"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2426760","2428920"," sense? Oh, maybe it does or doesn't. I don't know."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2434200","2439320"," So maybe you understand what I'm saying there or not. But so I think the markets calling bullshit"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2439320","2442280"," on them and saying, fuck you, man, you don't talk to you, you're out of your fucking mind."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2444600","2445960"," There's no fucking way."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2445960","2459640"," Okay. Okay, so it's a 346 and after we got 14 minutes left. If you want to, we'll go back real"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2459640","2468040"," quick. Last 15 minutes here and just take a look. You've got on the upside target."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2468040","2477960"," On the upside, bulls want to attempt to close this gap up here, get above the hourly, the daily,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2477960","2485320"," and the half hour right here. What the bull's trying to do, squeeze it up. Sellers trying to"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2485320","2492520"," step in on the overnight or morning and begin to sell this dog shit down to the depths of hell."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2492520","2496920"," I can assure you right now, if you just looked at that SPX chart, there ain't shit holding up"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2496920","2502840"," the market here. So any kind of squeeze, you're going to treat as fake, right? Just fake squeezing."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2504840","2507880"," You're talking about one person holding up the entire market right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2509080","2514280"," Just looking for a place right now to sell this, sell this market down into a more reasonable price"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2515160","2526120"," targets to the downside of Friday include 4 20 87 right down here and then 4 16 84"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2526680","2532120"," into Friday. If you are a bull and you are looking for a reversal,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2534040","2542920"," you need to see price above 4 29 87. This will, this number will move down as time passes."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2544440","2548760"," But not quicker, not quick, not quick enough for you. It's going to be another week or two"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2548760","2552920"," until that weekly trigger moves back down a little bit more. So otherwise you're just looking for a"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2552920","2561240"," place to sell. Bull's not in control of this market right now. Big bottom on spy right here"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2561240","2567560"," and the real bottom is down at somewhere around 4 16 ish. This is the real bottom down below here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2567560","2574920"," Real demand, we known demand down here. So we're known demand is all these guys up here that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2574920","2580360"," were buying, they were like, nope, not unless we get back up here and we want to put some risk on"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2580360","2590040"," makes sense to me. Unless we get above this 4 39 4 30. We are sellers still into the end of"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2590040","2593720"," quarter here. Still sellers in the end of quarter."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2597560","2617560"," Yeah, I think you need, I think you need like, if you need the market to rally or you want the"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2617560","2624280"," market, like if I want the market to rally and I want the market to continue higher for longer,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2624280","2632760"," you just the market just needs to see all the market needs to see is that the Fed is doing its"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2632760","2640680"," job. Does that make sense to you? So as long as the as long as the market believes that the Fed is"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2640680","2651240"," doing its job, right? The market can go higher. It just needs to believe that the Fed is doing its"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2651240","2658120"," job. When the market doesn't lot like when the Fed is not just doing its job, but is actually"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2658120","2664840"," becoming activist, there's like when you see that that Jerome meeting right was not good."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2666280","2672040"," They did not need to to say any of that other shit show any of the dot plots didn't need to show"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2672040","2679160"," PCE didn't need to show unemployment rates. Any of that kind of nonsense did not need to show it."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2679240","2687080"," So they're over selling their the Fed is over selling their position on what they're going to do"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2688120","2692360"," to the market. They just need all they need to say was higher for longer. They had just said that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2692360","2699400"," that had been fine. And now you don't have the Fed doing that. So you need the Fed. Jerome Powell"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2699400","2705720"," needs to come out and be like, he needs to come out and be like, you know, you've overreacted to"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2705880","2710440"," what I was saying. Or maybe you misinterpreted what I was saying. So I'll be paying attention"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2710440","2718120"," very closely to see if he can step up and try to talk the market down. Or at least make some"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2718120","2723480"," kind of like concession or something. And he sent cash carry out there today already trying to do"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2723480","2728040"," damage control. We'll see if he can continue on with that damage control if you can he can,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2728120","2731800"," but I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it. I'm not buying it in any way shape or form."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2741480","2753320"," Not buying it. Yeah, I don't believe the Fed. I think the Fed are whores, man. I don't like I"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2753320","2757640"," do believe the Fed, but then I don't believe the Fed."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2768120","2771320"," Yeah, and they're asking for calls for tomorrow. They're asking for"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2772280","2780920"," four twenty eight eighty fucking cents, dude. 80 cents for four twenty eights for tomorrow."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2781480","2790840"," That's fucking insane. Oh, insane. Oh, let's start with a small position alone."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2791560","2803720"," Long four twenty eight C for tomorrow. There's only only 10 contracts for tomorrow expiry"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2803720","2809160"," September 27. We'll see if we can get it here tomorrow, but even this squeeze right here,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2809160","2813800"," I ain't fucking buying it like this squeeze. Remember the squeeze is into this close. This"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2813800","2822440"," shit's gonna get sold. So I got I got some contracts for tomorrow, but still looking"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2822440","2827400"," debt to sell down into the weekend. Yeah, I don't believe the Fed, man. I ain't believe in it. Like,"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2827400","2837240"," I can't believe the Fed is going to I think it comes quicker than we see. I think it's kind of a"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2837240","2841960"," weird thing. Whenever these things happen, it's like one day everything is fine. The next thing"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2841960","2846680"," you see, it's like a bunch of for sale signs out in front. You start to see all your friends"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2846680","2850600"," getting fucking laid off and all this shit. It's like a blink of an eye how fast it happens."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2852760","2858520"," You know, have you ever heard like the Fed overtightening? We're we're we're like right"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2858520","2861720"," there right now. Like, are they gonna overtighten or not? That's the question, right? Are they"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2861720","2867560"," gonna overtighten or not? And so the expectation here is unless the Fed talks it down, at least"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2868120","2874120"," Jerome Powell talks that talk down. They gave me the they gave me the impression that they were"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2874120","2879080"," down to overtighten. So that's what they want to do. If we're going back to the old school Fed"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2879080","2883880"," where they overtighten, they over loosen, we're gonna make the fucking market go wild. So be it."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2890040","2893080"," I'm in some calls right now. So it depends on where price is."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2897560","2906120"," I'm looking for a rejection off of 427.49. So right here, I'm looking for this trade right here."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2908120","2913800"," For that trade right there. And then some kind of sell down. If I can hold these to 415, I will."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2920040","2923480"," Yeah, they gave me one penny right now. I'm up one penny on this squeeze."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2923480","2931080"," One penny right now. They got make me pay an 80 cents for fucking overnight zero dates."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2934280","2941320"," These are 31 deltas too. They're out of their fucking mines. Give me no, I'm up two pennies."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2941320","2946040"," One penny, two pennies right now. We'll hold these like 415."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2946040","2957400"," No, no, no, I can't sell this here. You guys understand, like, you guys don't fucking understand."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2958040","2964360"," I can't sell this clothes. I got to sell like S2 with B and S2 for me to sell it. We're not going"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2964360","2968600"," to do that cash market. I'm going to run this shit up and then sell it at either the overnight"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2968760","2969800"," and cash market tomorrow."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","2990280","2995640"," Trading 78 cents right now and 80 cent calls even on that last little rip right there."

"hyTBo-cFYKU","3035000","3051640"," Trading 83 gave me three pennies right now in this. That was it. Three pennies."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3051640","3065160"," Yeah, I got zero faith right now zero zero faith. You need Jerome to come out and give you"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3066360","3070040"," if you're a bull, you need your if you're a bull, you need your own the command wheel that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3070040","3075640"," shit back. Hey, it's the tone that fucking needs to tone that conversation down."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3076520","3083080"," You need you must have Jerome. You have to have Jerome toned back that shit. He's toned that"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3083080","3088440"," tone down that conversation. That wild ass shit that he's talking on that and that in that rate"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3088440","3093560"," decision. Cannot have him out there fucking wild ass and that's shit. There ain't no way."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3095240","3097320"," There ain't no way. Just dial it back a little bit."
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3097320","3109080"," Never enough like if you had like feel like a minor Fed president out there breaking out"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3109080","3114920"," charts and dot plots and all that shit, be fine with that. But the Fed president has no business"
"hyTBo-cFYKU","3116200","3121320"," out there trying to show that shit trying to convince me. That wasn't for me. That was like"
