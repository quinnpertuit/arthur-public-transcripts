"650","2410"," Mic check, one, two, three, four."
"2650","2930"," Mic check."
"5990","6870"," Bull's ain't done yet. "
"6990","8130"," They got five days, brother."
"10870","12190"," What have you got going on here?"
"21030","22470"," Check one, two."
"22850","23110"," Mic check. "
"23590","24630"," Check, check, check."
"25130","29030"," I think I'm one of the most disgusting copies you can get because you're not busy."
"30110","34860"," I'm going to shut down a little bit. "
"35800","43720"," One, two."
"45560","46720"," Check one, two, baby."
"47480","49840"," Read through that as best you can please. "
"63120","64160"," Good morning."
"64340","64720"," Good morning."
"64820","65700"," How y'all doing out there?"
"67700","70780"," I was trying to start late this morning. "
"72240","73240"," What's going on?"
"74180","75120"," Hey, I'm doing out there."
"76340","80040"," I don't know, like, today I'm feeling pretty good today."
"82740","85460"," Let's see to get right into it, right in the main screen here. "
"88540","90280"," So, we got my camera working."
"90840","93280"," It was weird, like Streamlabs did a bunch of downloading."
"95980","97000"," You got golf today?"
"97180","98400"," Somebody say that golf day today?"
"98600","99760"," If you have golf day today, congratulations. "
"101780","102780"," Just heads up here."
"102900","103980"," We got a few things to look at."
"104340","106020"," So, we're going to start this. "
"106280","110240"," We're going to go over to me a second here."
"114800","116760"," I got a few things I got to do here."
"117240","118100"," Let me check something here. "
"119820","120680"," Okay, all right."
"121840","124880"," Let me just check one more thing here."
"127300","132940"," Okay, I think we're good. "
"133600","137180"," All right, so good morning to you all."
"138020","140420"," We're going to, we should be coming up here."
"141400","149520"," I posted this chart down below for you here, and we'll take a look at it and see what all"
"149520","150100"," this means. "
"150200","153840"," We should go up here and squeeze up into this green box up here."
"154480","155300"," Screen and gray box."
"155720","160420"," What we're looking for here is, if there's a reversal to the downside. "
"160420","162520"," Now, we can squeeze above that hourly trigger."
"164960","169460"," There's not a lot of resistance to the upside, so we might go up."
"169620","171000"," There's some stuff we have to go over today. "
"171200","178160"," So, here is book map."
"179340","182220"," We're pretty light here in market."
"184580","186100"," Not quite what rug pull. "
"186580","187800"," There's some levels in here."
"189060","192740"," They're just not that strong, and this is kind of, this is support."
"193220","193920"," This is it, right?"
"194060","195120"," This is kind of it right here. "
"196440","198020"," There's not much market to the upside."
"199100","200580"," There's not much, well, it shouldn't say that."
"200720","202440"," There is market to the upside up here. "
"202920","210640"," There's some more market down here, but outside of hidden levels and stuff like that, not a good"
"210640","211480"," sign in here, right?"
"211620","213160"," This is kind of it right here for support."
"215540","216400"," Hold on a second here."
"219440","224640"," On the trigger screen, let's go to the weebles chart. "
"225260","227300"," Let's look at this chart from yesterday."
"229600","231080"," And we'll take a look at this."
"231440","239740"," So, we talked yesterday about yesterday we looked at the weekly outlook, right?"
"243800","246300"," And yesterday we took some puts up here. "
"246780","249980"," For today, you know, grabbing some puts up here."
"250040","251240"," I was going to grab some calls up here."
"251260","252080"," We didn't grab any puts. "
"254460","256399"," Now, the bull run is not over."
"257079","261240"," There's a couple things I want to tell you this morning, which is, number one, the bull run is not"
"261240","261780"," over."
"262500","265100"," If you think that it's over, it's likely not. "
"266380","267200"," Let me see here."
"267500","268320"," Put my camera back on."
"269280","271300"," The bull run, they've got like five days minimum. "
"271820","272540"," Now, that could extend."
"273320","275820"," I'm always suspect to of."
"276100","279840"," There is a soft landing, of course, so that cannot be forecasted. "
"281420","284060"," I'm always suspect of what the pros tell you, right?"
"284220","286300"," They're not here to help you with you like that or not."
"286440","286620"," They're not."
"286660","287620"," They're really not here to help you. "
"287700","289900"," So, price action is king."
"290140","290580"," We know that."
"291120","293460"," I want you guys to understand something out there. "
"293800","294300"," Hold on a second."
"294360","295300"," Let me post this up."
"295460","296000"," Hold on a second here. "
"298480","300740"," Because I want to make sure people are here too."
"301980","304240"," They don't come back in and ask a bunch of questions."
"306180","308100"," Repetitive stuff that we're going over now. "
"308360","310320"," So, let me just post this up real quick."
"310320","320240"," And yes, maybe today we can go over soft hard landings, that kind of"
"320240","320740"," stuff too."
"321600","322800"," We'll go over Tesla too. "
"324140","326420"," Then we might go over, you know, make our GME today too."
"326600","328420"," Because I know that people are pretty pissed off."
"328420","330640"," I saw a bunch of people on Reddit. "
"331160","333780"," And they're fucking on fire on Reddit right now."
"335100","336040"," Let me see."
"336620","337640"," Live stream. "
"341220","342940"," People are pretty upset."
"343320","347300"," So, YT."
"348840","350980"," And then what else we got here?"
"352400","352640"," Switch. "
"360960","362200"," Give me one quick second."
"362400","364460"," I got to do this one quick thing here."
"367740","369760"," So, we were looking at this chart yesterday, right?"
"373100","375860"," And we can go back and look at SPX as well. "
"378850","381230"," And we'll show you those gamma levels."
"382050","385430"," Now, they're saying, all these people out there are saying, well, it's weird."
"386290","396010"," Last week, a famous fin Twitter, who claims to be a financial"
"396010","401890"," advisor, made a post on, as a matter of fact, they own a big website. "
"402070","403290"," One of the biggest websites out there."
"403510","404430"," I'm not going to say who it is."
"405330","408030"," It's probably not who you think it is, but they're famous. "
"408610","411830"," And they posted that CTAs were net short."
"412750","414790"," And they were not net short."
"414790","417450"," And there was nothing that came out of a Bloomberg terminal that said that either. "
"418570","423810"," Now, they had slowed down their buying, but they were not net short of the market."
"424010","424650"," That's a key point."
"425310","426890"," They had just stopped buying. "
"427450","430110"," I didn't say anything to the guy public on Fintuit."
"431670","436090"," Now, other people, other famous people on Fintuit posted that didn't post that."
"436150","436890"," They post something contradictory. "
"437850","438790"," But I didn't want to say that."
"438790","444450"," But it's fascinating because this morning, early morning, there was a fin Twitter that said, I"
"444450","446930"," caught some CTAs lying on Fintuit."
"447070","449430"," And I was like, yeah, I caught that a couple days ago. "
"450090","451950"," So it's not necessarily that they're short right now."
"452330","455830"," And now CTAs are saying, if you're a bully, you've got five days."
"457030","458510"," And that's not necessarily true either. "
"458690","459770"," Price action is always king."
"460590","463710"," So no matter what you see me posted on Fintuit, stuff like that."
"464350","464950"," Today's Tuesday. "
"465610","469410"," Today is a day of you scare a bull."
"469890","472210"," And then the market actually goes up or you scare a bear."
"472750","473870"," And then the market goes down. "
"474150","476690"," So Tuesdays, sometimes even to Wednesday and Thursday."
"476890","479050"," It will be a repricing of commercial real estate."
"479350","481730"," But it will be well anticipated and not a shock. "
"482290","483770"," I'm going to mute this for a minute here."
"485190","488190"," Wednesday, Wednesday Thursday can also be obscured."
"488570","490630"," Obscured for these guys to get paid. "
"490830","492210"," Now, these people are long the market."
"492210","493370"," They haven't sold the market."
"494290","495550"," They've bought into the market. "
"495730","497650"," So they're looking for a specific price."
"497970","498650"," Now, dealers here."
"499450","506050"," Now, if we have slowing of buying equities like a forced buying or you've got banks out there that"
"506050","514190"," have done all their buying, you're not going to get dealers to chase real money buying any longer,"
"514450","514530"," right?"
"514770","515950"," Chasing that price higher. "
"517350","518250"," That is a problem."
"518570","520429"," Now, it doesn't mean we won't go to 4,600."
"520429","527290"," It just means that dealers will murder the options chain to go to 4,600. "
"527330","532230"," If we go there, if we go to 4,600, they're going to try to murder the entire option chain."
"532310","535770"," I went through the option chain yesterday and it was fucking calls."
"536170","536870"," That's all it was. "
"537070","538330"," It was just calls in the market."
"538490","539070"," It was disgusting."
"540350","545530"," And if you go to my screener right here, it shows how call heavy we are. "
"545770","548730"," Behind my camera, it's the same situation."
"548730","551650"," I'm going to move that up so you can see it."
"551830","552710"," It's the same situation. "
"552930","554250"," We are lopsided calls."
"554850","557730"," That doesn't mean we can't go up here and tag all this stuff."
"558210","563130"," It just means that they're going to murder that shit and then be like, hey, we hit the number right"
"563130","563630"," that you wanted. "
"563630","565590"," We got there, but your options are burned."
"566450","573330"," So you could go to 4, 460 in that option for Friday or whenever they hit it could be fucking,"
"573510","576430"," you know, worth 10 cents or 20 cents, right, for some spreads."
"577270","583030"," Meanwhile, you're probably a new trader out there thinking that because you're going to 4, 460 that"
"583030","584670"," your 460Cs are going to print. "
"585570","594530"," And I assure you that unless dealers are chasing real money buying, they're not going to do that,"
"594670","594770"," right?"
"595410","600990"," Now, bulls basically have five sessions left for their bullish pieces."
"600990","610230"," So you got to give that to, you have to give that to, you have to give that to bulls"
"610230","613670"," until that time frame, at least that time frame runs out."
"614210","617170"," Now, we have expected moves every week, right?"
"617490","618650"," One sigma move in a week. "
"619190","622850"," You shouldn't be too down on yourself for us being down today."
"623430","623850"," We got Monday."
"624150","624590"," We got Tuesday. "
"625750","628630"," And I don't know that I'm going to get this deep into the market."
"628630","630810"," I don't know that we're going to get this deep down here."
"631510","636690"," The idea here is that on the week, you have to expect to move to the downside and then you"
"636690","637830"," buy a dip wherever you can. "
"638350","642130"," So if you're a bull out there, it wouldn't be all like taking a can down the road and upset"
"642130","642590"," it yourself."
"643250","650090"," I'd be like, just like yesterday, hey, we started a new week, look for a low to buy and put"
"650090","651050"," stops underneath it."
"651210","652450"," Where are those lows?"
"652810","656450"," Those lows are, if we can get there, they're down. "
"656450","659630"," And remember, we're on Tuesday, right?"
"659870","660550"," Manipulation, right?"
"660930","661950"," Manipulation day, right?"
"662110","663670"," They don't want you to know where we're going."
"664430","666910"," Now, I would love to buy this down here."
"666970","668590"," I would love to buy this down here. "
"668670","670870"," If I can buy this and I can buy this, I'm a happy guy."
"674690","676370"," I'm not going to get all beared up yet."
"678150","681710"," Oh, doom and gloom closed a bunch of gaps down below and that kind of stuff. "
"681910","683390"," And this is where the negative gamma is."
"683390","688050"," So as long as we stay up here, you're bullish and you're, you're buying dips."
"688630","695290"," And to further that point, if at any point we break above this hourly trigger up here, you're long"
"695290","695930"," in this shit. "
"696830","698170"," Oh, ah, ah."
"698510","700190"," Who was saying it cats with me again today?"
"702630","703430"," Hey, buddy."
"705550","712710"," So it's not like you can't go long if we break above this hourly trigger up here and we can"
"712710","715950"," start heading higher and break past this previous high from yesterday. "
"716870","718190"," We're bullish and running again."
"718490","724350"," If we head back down here and hit those bottoms, that 452 or whatever, you buy in that bottom,"
"724530","725150"," we're heading higher."
"725410","731450"," So nothing has fundamentally and price action wise changed to be like super bear here. "
"732210","736930"," And no matter what I post to you, no matter what you see that they're saying, that doesn't mean"
"736930","738310"," that I feel like that either."
"738550","740570"," It's like level to level always."
"741310","742810"," This is how you get in trouble. "
"743090","747150"," If you don't, you'll get in trouble if you get married to any thesis out there."
"748570","749870"," So be aware of that."
"750050","752970"," So even right now where we are, we're not bearish yet. "
"753150","754410"," We're not in negative gamma."
"755010","759750"," And we are trying to buy dips to target that for 60."
"760410","765730"," Don't lose sight of that with all with me saying, hey, look for weakness today. "
"765830","768950"," Look for weakness tomorrow and possibly the rest of the week."
"768950","770830"," Now we do a ton of economic news coming out."
"770910","772850"," We've got Jerome Powell twice this week. "
"773170","775170"," We got Fed Speakers up the ass."
"776510","778750"," I checked on Japan this morning on the end."
"779690","782270"," And yeah, it's not so bad what they did. "
"782270","786550"," They have actually pay the pay in the, the Bank of Japan guy a little bit more money."
"788750","791170"," But nothing terrible this morning out of Japan."
"792390","794650"," So price action here for you. "
"794750","799430"," If you're a bull, my point to you is that if you're a bull, you should have like a piece"
"799430","801950"," of paper or notepad and all the things that I tell you."
"802130","803270"," This is where you're buying dips."
"803850","806230"," This is where you're getting long over the hourly trigger. "
"806810","811210"," If we squeeze up and over the hourly trigger, we know that it has to come back down and still"
"811210","812270"," confirm the move higher."
"812830","815590"," So we know all of our rules for what we need to do to make money here."
"816130","816250"," Okay. "
"817030","823010"," And if you're a bear, if you're a, if you're south side, you have to just like a bull, right?"
"823010","826750"," You have to take it level by level until you're in the clear."
"827490","831510"," So if this is the inverse right now for like when I talk to sellers, right?"
"831590","833430"," Or I talk to bulls and I'm like, Hey, you have a lot of work to do."
"833430","836630"," You've got to do these levels before you're in the clear to start pushing higher. "
"836870","838710"," Same thing goes for a seller or a bear."
"839090","844430"," They have levels that have to break through one, two, three for just small points."
"845730","848690"," And that sell side regime. "
"850010","851690"," So we're not there yet."
"851690","853930"," So I wouldn't be panicking if I was a bull."
"854030","855210"," I wouldn't be like freaking out. "
"855550","860110"," I would say to you that they're probably right on those five, on those five sessions."
"861890","868530"," And there's a, there's a discussion coming out that December is going to be a nasty month."
"869350","872630"," That after these five sessions, the market is free to go down. "
"872950","882830"," You guys know that I've, I've shown examples of very famous fin twitters that say, Hey, the"
"882830","885250"," gamma has been freed in the market for it to go down, right?"
"885370","886150"," The window of weakness."
"886770","887910"," You know who says that shit?"
"888270","889850"," And when they're wrong, it's bad."
"890090","891170"," Like they're wrong big. "
"891450","899510"," So first and foremost, always, always stick with the reason we do this show is for you to have"
"899510","899870"," tools."
"900470","906270"," You have rules that you write down for yourself and you follow those tools no matter what."
"906370","908350"," So keep that in your mind. "
"908350","911830"," No matter what you read, no matter what you're consuming from me or anyone else out there."
"912670","914690"," Remember that price action is king."
"915090","916390"," Always remember that. "
"917190","919990"," If you begin to see this get sold up here, right?"
"920170","923050"," We start selling this, start resisting here on hourly trigger."
"923590","929170"," You already know that below this previous low that you can probably take another short or put that"
"929170","930730"," to get down there and stuff like that."
"931010","935850"," If we break above and start heading higher and taking out these previous highs, you know, you can"
"935850","937810"," take a long call this way. "
"937810","940090"," So remember, I want you to remember your tools."
"940230","946610"," I want you to remember all of the lessons that we teach here, how we break up and break down"
"946610","950830"," and consolidate for that move higher or lower on multiple timeframes."
"951250","953110"," Never give that stuff up. "
"953290","958450"," No matter what you're reading, consuming, seeing out there on TV."
"958730","960170"," It'll serve you well."
"960690","965730"," It'll serve you well over time when you're most fearful. "
"966510","968890"," That doesn't matter if you're a seller or a buyer."
"969190","971290"," Stick with those tools that you get here."
"971730","973570"," Use those tools to your advantage. "
"975970","980070"," They, statistically and probability wise, they're going to serve you better than anything you're"
"980070","985450"," reading or consuming in the news or in social media."
"986270","993790"," As a matter of fact, I was in the phone this morning with a close friend of mine and we"
"993790","997070"," were discussing Tesla this morning in detail and in depth."
"997890","1007580"," We were discussing Tesla and our discussion on Tesla was now this year or this event"
"1007580","1009300"," is during market hours. "
"1009960","1011020"," We'll get into all this later."
"1011220","1013760"," I'm just going to, I'm going to encapsulate this in a short conversation."
"1014200","1024240"," We'll go over it in more detail later today, but basically, you know, unlike previous events, which"
"1024240","1026640"," are outside of market hours, this one is. "
"1027160","1036440"," But if you were to look at all Tesla events as a whole, right, the rule is that you"
"1036440","1045700"," either go farther out in time or you wait past that expiry after the event to get long or get"
"1045700","1046960"," short, whatever it is."
"1047180","1047940"," Mostly it's get long."
"1048520","1050360"," But the rule is that you basically wait. "
"1050360","1052580"," Now, this might not apply to this event."
"1053060","1054880"," I might be wrong in this event."
"1055500","1059420"," But this guy, the way I was talking to this morning, very close trusted friend of mine of Tesla. "
"1059720","1063940"," Him and I were discussing it and I said, you know what though, or he said to me and I"
"1063940","1065720"," said to him, both of us knew, know this."
"1066580","1072260"," If you apply that rule to Tesla, even if you were wrong this week and it goes to the moon,"
"1073200","1078800"," you still would have been better off not trading it and waiting until that expiry ends."
"1078800","1085800"," If you were to give you to track the last 10 Tesla events and overall, you're going to be a"
"1085800","1089580"," better and happier Tesla bull by sticking to those rules. "
"1090120","1094920"," Now, there'll always be one, there's always one person out there that'll say, haha, you're wrong."
"1095320","1096800"," Tesla went up, right?"
"1097600","1102960"," But if you were to look as an investor in a trader over your last 10 Tesla events, you are"
"1102960","1110860"," way past a lot of Tesla bulls out there by waiting for that event to pass for that ER to"
"1110860","1112240"," pass any of that kind of stuff."
"1112480","1116260"," So, when you're making your toolbox out there, right?"
"1116660","1123000"," The reason I started this show in the beginning was because people, I see that people don't have"
"1123000","1123280"," rules. "
"1123580","1123960"," They don't have tools."
"1124240","1124720"," They don't have toolbox."
"1125140","1126260"," They're just like winging shit. "
"1126560","1130780"," Like all this guy says this and this guy says that and I'm a judge and jury at home as"
"1130780","1134200"," to which one I believe right now and you have no system."
"1135240","1137440"," And you guys need to have, what do you don't need to?"
"1137440","1145700"," But what I've found over the years is systems tend to, you have the ability to tinker with them"
"1145700","1148580"," until you become a profitable trader."
"1148940","1150520"," So be aware of that. "
"1150520","1155040"," So we're coming into the hourly half hour and hourly trigger right now on spy."
"1157290","1158790"," Let's see if I can show that to you."
"1160750","1166050"," And we'll get in a Tesla later if they're going to have a great event on Thursday. "
"1166050","1172410"," If we're going to go to the moon, some ways to trade it to, there are 24 hour options that"
"1172410","1173810"," are not Tesla that you can trade."
"1174350","1182910"," You can also trade Tesla in that event with stock and not options because there probably is some"
"1182910","1186130"," kind of news coming out of Tesla that could make the market react."
"1186750","1189610"," And I'll tell you what that news is later today. "
"1190310","1192130"," Oh yeah, look at that squeeze, baby."
"1193510","1194890"," Look at that squeeze."
"1195490","1199770"," Remember on this trade right here, we want to get above our previous high. "
"1200930","1202010"," Well, I'm right here."
"1202210","1204710"," Nice squeezing squeeze squeeze."
"1205490","1208270"," And we're looking for yesterday's high. "
"1209310","1210530"," One second here."
"1211810","1213890"," And that is right here."
"1215470","1216930"," We want to get above. "
"1217730","1220330"," We want to get above that yellow box right there."
"1220550","1221770"," We're going to make that white right now."
"1223110","1226530"," When I get above this yellow box to show bullishness, then reverse. "
"1227150","1228990"," If we can, we can get up there and come back down."
"1229610","1231190"," We're off and running to the upside."
"1232330","1234570"," Look at that fucking nice squeeze right there. "
"1237850","1242410"," So my point to, I'm staying on the Tesla for a minute here."
"1242690","1245730"," There is some news likely going to be that is likely going to be dropped."
"1245990","1250850"," It's not true that's going to come off as true and could get a positive reaction out of Tesla, but"
"1250850","1252230"," should you trade it or not?"
"1252510","1258730"," If you stick with your rules on Tesla, you're likely better off not trading it, even if it was to"
"1258730","1264050"," squeeze, but that fear of missing out the FOMO and then the one person back on saying, ah, you got"
"1264050","1264950"," fucked there, right?"
"1265190","1266910"," Well, you didn't get to participate or whatever. "
"1267770","1272470"," And you, if you're a new investor, a new new trader, you're likely going to be like, I'll never"
"1272470","1273290"," miss that again."
"1273290","1275410"," Then you go to the next event and you're going to get smoked."
"1275810","1277470"," You go to the next event, you're going to get smoked. "
"1277470","1278610"," You're going to go to the next event."
"1278610","1284430"," You're going to get smoked all based upon that one time where the market or Tesla actually went up"
"1284430","1285250"," on that one event."
"1285490","1289390"," So we'll talk about that more in detail later this morning. "
"1290550","1291950"," Nice squeeze right there."
"1292070","1292550"," Look at that squeeze."
"1294290","1294850"," 4."
"1298640","1299200"," 4."
"1299860","1300420"," 55. "
"1301540","1301820"," 8."
"1310280","1313080"," That's the one that bulls want to break above right there."
"1313600","1318220"," I'm going to break above that yellow box right there, right there if they can."
"1319840","1322700"," We'll make that white today. "
"1323880","1327780"," So it matches up with the chart down below right there."
"1328540","1333940"," Now if you want to get just above, just above this white box, just above it."
"1333940","1334820"," You want to go below it. "
"1335580","1337160"," If you fail this, not good."
"1337320","1339740"," You want to go just right there."
"1340620","1342040"," Even if it pulls back. "
"1347120","1349840"," Did I close some fucking puts here a little while ago?"
"1351180","1354340"," I close some puts and I'm so fucking stoked."
"1354340","1355680"," One second here."
"1377460","1378880"," Getting tight one second here. "
"1401600","1403300"," Think tight one second, I'm going to take care of a trade."
"1409310","1410790"," What the fuck man?"
"1421660","1422860"," Think tight one second here guys."
"1463230","1464470"," You guys want to watch this with me?"
"1464530","1465550"," You want to see what I'm watching right now?"
"1467270","1468570"," I'm watching this right here. "
"1468690","1469790"," I'm trying to get some calls."
"1469990","1471190"," I'm going to get rid of these real quick."
"1493010","1495550"," They went to 86 fucking cents just then. "
"1497890","1501040"," Think tight one second here."
"1504430","1506410"," We should see a pullback right here."
"1509400","1514140"," We want to see if this holds right here to go higher for this next trip. "
"1514300","1516080"," I'm going to try to get some more calls right over here."
"1554110","1555090"," Turn on this."
"1560250","1564370"," Boeman says it's quite possible the Fed policy rate will need to be at a higher level than before"
"1564370","1566930"," the pandemic to foster low stable inflation. "
"1567610","1570770"," Boeman also saying a favor hiking rates of inflation progress stalls."
"1571950","1575010"," That's due to the uninversion of the yield curve."
"1575170","1576770"," It's their primary vehicle right now. "
"1577770","1581270"," Without them having that primary vehicle rates will be it."
"1585440","1587680"," Still missed that top tick over here."
"1589000","1591000"," You might have one more push coming up. "
"1591480","1599800"," You might see one more push up here, but still missing that"
"1599800","1603060"," previous high."
"1691710","1693070"," Come on back down."
"1705160","1709200"," This is fucking like watching fucking paint peel past couple days. "
"1733660","1735200"," I'm my brain."
"1735380","1737460"," I'm like, yeah, let's do one more up here."
"1739000","1740640"," Well, again, it's not really enough. "
"1764040","1766080"," All right, give me a couple seconds here."
"1768750","1770250"," What's going on?"
"1771930","1774210"," Feels like still on holiday."
"1776970","1778510"," Yeah, it does feel like we're in holiday. "
"1778870","1779410"," Eugene Park."
"1779630","1779930"," How are you?"
"1780490","1782270"," Captain, you take a look at SSTK."
"1783170","1784150"," I'll write it down for you. "
"1789300","1791020"," Where the fuck did that come from?"
"1791020","1792140"," Same stuff."
"1792480","1794680"," Cause not short shorts to cover up."
"1796220","1797740"," More important stretch of walls. "
"1797920","1798240"," How are you?"
"1800600","1801460"," What's going on?"
"1801540","1802520"," Market is not full of calls."
"1802700","1803800"," Please see why not gamma."
"1804080","1804740"," Oh, that was 11. "
"1805060","1807400"," I said calls and I apologize."
"1808180","1812100"," In a prerecorded video address at the 2023."
"1812320","1813660"," You're a financial resident. "
"1814260","1817540"," You're a corporate reporting."
"1817960","1820020"," Pull out a second here."
"1822100","1822580"," Turn this down. "
"1823940","1828320"," Again, blasting in my ear with this financial juice shit."
"1830680","1832180"," Check, check, check, check, check."
"1832580","1835140"," Maybe it's just fucking financial juice that's that loud. "
"1839260","1840280"," Ross Gerber."
"1841120","1841880"," Fucking wrecked."
"1842160","1842820"," I short hello. "
"1843860","1845240"," It also seems the front month."
"1845540","1846140"," 12 or 5 expires."
"1846280","1847860"," I'm having the put OI near the money. "
"1849440","1852540"," I've got put OI charts here."
"1853540","1854640"," What is your total call?"
"1854840","1855380"," Put RSPX."
"1855560","1856980"," I show the ratios more or less even. "
"1857720","1858120"," How's it going?"
"1858380","1858900"," It means dealers buy."
"1859580","1860540"," Cannon moves picks up."
"1860780","1861320"," No, no, no. "
"1861400","1861780"," It's not true."
"1862600","1863780"," Not in this situation."
"1865260","1865960"," I'll explain it to you. "
"1866060","1867760"," I'll get back to that point right there later."
"1868540","1871080"," Told jury duty is entirely a rate-efficient make money fellows."
"1871300","1872140"," I get five bucks a day. "
"1872380","1873580"," Five fucking dollars a day."
"1875780","1877260"," When is the trigger going to come out?"
"1877260","1878980"," Had a meeting this morning about the trigger coming out?"
"1879980","1881220"," Bazz or what's going on, brother?"
"1882540","1883760"," Golf day, best wishes."
"1884320","1884860"," Hell yeah, baby. "
"1885060","1885340"," Hell yeah."
"1885440","1885720"," You too."
"1887140","1888100"," One second here. "
"1889900","1890840"," Dot up for you."
"1897100","1898940"," Come on the fuck back down here, dude."
"1899160","1900320"," Just come down here. "
"1903160","1904600"," What is going on, everybody?"
"1905980","1908580"," What do I think of Bitcoin in crypto?"
"1908580","1910280"," What is gamma right now?"
"1912660","1913140"," Hold on."
"1913200","1913980"," I guess it's got a bunch of..."
"1913980","1915680"," Okay, take a look at SSTK."
"1915840","1917320"," I'll write that one down and write that down. "
"1920240","1921840"," Is this the shorts coming into the..."
"1922680","1924820"," SSTK is the shorts coming into the market right now?"
"1927780","1930840"," Yeah, no, gamma is at 45.50. Hold on one second here."
"1930920","1932160"," I'm going to go look at this right now with you guys."
"1932340","1932740"," Hold on a second here. "
"1937620","1938560"," We'll squeeze over."
"1938700","1939540"," I'll show you guys right now."
"1942050","1942230"," Hang tight. "
"1942350","1943990"," I'm going to get some levels and I export them."
"1943990","1944690"," Hang tight."
"1944810","1945330"," One quick second. "
"1957120","1957700"," Hang tight."
"1957840","1959220"," I'm going to bring this over here, boys."
"1959440","1960280"," I can do this over here. "
"1964260","1967020"," Dude, why is that red and white?"
"1967680","1969820"," Dude, what is going on with my..."
"1970340","1971060"," That's unnamed."
"1972240","1973260"," That shouldn't be red and white."
"1974200","1974540"," Where's gamma?"
"1975200","1976040"," Head swaps price. "
"1976540","1977180"," Five basis points."
"1977620","1978100"," Additional easing."
"1978340","1978760"," Load layout. "
"1979360","1979440"," Gamma."
"1979440","1980500"," 20-24."
"1986150","1986680"," Load. "
"1989010","1990280"," Wait one second, boys."
"1999140","2000470"," What the fuck is that?"
"2005370","2006340"," Export levels?"
"2012250","2013140"," Why is that?"
"2013140","2015520"," Why am I not getting these levels in here today?"
"2019460","2019900"," Cool."
"2019980","2021620"," I'm saying, guys, I get some going on the background. "
"2045560","2047639"," Some reason it's not copying and pasting."
"2055510","2056469"," I wonder what it is."
"2057929","2058469"," Okay, whatever. "
"2058850","2060610"," I'm going to have more fucking problems again today."
"2063230","2065190"," I'm going to close this so it doesn't save."
"2084580","2086600"," Maybe we'll go over here really quick. "
"2087940","2090900"," I was trying to upload the levels from this morning, but I don't have them up."
"2092040","2094260"," I can't copy and paste them for some fucking reason."
"2097700","2098300"," Hang tight. "
"2098440","2098920"," One second here."
"2102170","2104050"," That's 11 a.m. Eastern time."
"2104230","2110490"," We expect comments from ECB's of the guard who's in a pre-recorded video address at 2023 European. "
"2110850","2113150"," They got like every single conference."
"2113790","2118310"," They have every single, like every fucking federal official coming out to talk this week."
"2123260","2127800"," Registration for this event is pinned to President Lagarde's entry on the calendar. "
"2128800","2130180"," Yeah, yeah, come on back down."
"2131940","2133080"," Come on back down."
"2145270","2146890"," Blue jets off their horse. "
"2164750","2165910"," I'm going to click second here."
"2169770","2170950"," I want to buy that right there."
"2171670","2173070"," That one minute trigger, but I'm not going to. "
"2179790","2180470"," All right."
"2183170","2183950"," Right here."
"2189100","2191120"," So here are your gamma. "
"2191520","2191940"," Yeah."
"2192740","2194420"," This one really doesn't show it."
"2194480","2195080"," Well, either. "
"2197980","2199500"," This one's not really showing."
"2199880","2202200"," Yeah, that's not really showing because we're higher."
"2202480","2204060"," Now we've got 4600 above here. "
"2204940","2205920"," Hold on one second here."
"2208250","2209210"," This one will work."
"2211290","2212430"," Yeah, leave that. "
"2215090","2215930"," Right there."
"2217110","2218710"," Okay, so here is the."
"2219270","2220130"," Here's your game. "
"2220310","2222370"," Here's your SPX net gamma for this morning."
"2222630","2224530"," You've got this strike right here at 450."
"2225730","2229450"," And then you've got this strike up here at 4600 right up here. "
"2229530","2230990"," This is the big magnet right here."
"2232450","2232970"," 4575."
"2233770","2239370"," So if I go to so you got 454550, which is right here. "
"2239930","2244990"," That's that magnet we keep pushing to treasury notes up to zero spot four basis points."
"2245590","2246090"," 4520."
"2246890","2248190"," This is the one that's down below. "
"2248450","2248930"," This is the bot."
"2249110","2252450"," The dip that we're trying to buy 4520 on SPX."
"2252970","2259110"," Then you have this giant tag above here at 4600 to this upside right here. "

"6652680","6655980"," There's no reason to insist the rates remain really high."
"6656180","6658760"," So you got mixed signals here from Fed officials. "
"6659380","6663220"," But the truth is here that you're going to, oh, I want to see them grab this here."
"6673970","6676530"," Let's see if I can get a rejection off this one minute candle."
"6678390","6684570"," They're not the odd thing here, but if you don't have an inverted yield curve, how do they do their"
"6684570","6687110"," up their repo operations?"
"6687410","6690510"," Only they can do it is with raising rates. "
"6691150","6692410"," So there is probably some fear."
"6692770","6693730"," Not quite fear."
"6693870","6697130"," I don't think that they do like like an emergency rate increase. "
"6697410","6698310"," I don't think that they do."
"6698630","6700550"," They have a rate decision coming up in December."
"6700790","6702310"," I believe it's the 11th and 12th. "
"6702790","6709110"," So if you know, like that's a perfect time for them to raise rates, if we can blast this up"
"6709110","6715190"," into that rate decision and then you get your December down like that doom and gloom December that"
"6715190","6716290"," everybody's talking about happening."
"6763240","6770220"," All right, I got some four 54 P four P's right now, and we're gonna be looking for I'm looking"
"6770220","6772700"," for a roll down tight here."
"6776060","6781140"," Not necessarily a bad thing, but more like a down move right here. "
"6782080","6786280"," And then just some consolidating down here in this in this five minute range right here."
"6788850","6790010"," It's just a heads up."
"6790190","6792390"," We break above this one minute trigger at any point. "
"6793110","6798610"," Let's say we down and start to make our way higher."
"6798950","6801510"," I'll dump the puts and go long again calls to the upside."
"6802910","6804870"," That looks like it's all of it right now. "
"6805110","6807090"," I'd like to see I really like to see us."
"6807330","6812370"," I'd really like to see us break above here and just just get above this bullshit up here."
"6812370","6813790"," But I don't know if that's going to happen. "
"6813790","6816110"," So we'll see what happens."
"6817250","6820390"," If you can get above here, I'll cut the puts loose and I'll go with the calls to the upside."
"6830540","6832380"," All right, let's see what you guys are saying in the chat here. "
"6832480","6834160"," Sorry, that was really crazy right there."
"6837780","6844080"," It's just like a rocket drags rivian down with all the time, but not captain is mfg.dam weren't"
"6844080","6845840"," captain weren't crews smiling what's going on."
"6846660","6854710"," I need some of very venge puts an admission all business. "
"6856210","6858070"," And he goes and puts right now."
"6858650","6859570"," That's a question to you."
"6860610","6863990"," So the tools should be available to you really soon. "
"6864150","6868090"," We had a meeting this morning of a meeting coming up after today that I have one."
"6868190","6869010"," I have a big meeting today."
"6869010","6876640"," I have to get involved in SPX zero day call dollars at 4570. "
"6876640","6878040"," Yeah, I was hoping we'd get to that."
"6878300","6880420"," Career low is hoping get to that 4570."
"6880560","6881180"," We didn't get there. "
"6881600","6884500"," Maybe we'll get there later in the day or something like that, but you're right."
"6884740","6886160"," We're not going up there right now."
"6886200","6888700"," They fucking sold the they came down like raining up here. "
"6890220","6893200"," I don't know if we can get below this five minute trigger down here."
"6893440","6901350"," So I'd really like to see us at least get down here and consolidate and regroup as a as bulls."
"6902230","6903270"," 1215 right now. "
"6904690","6907030"," Sellers want to get down there get that new low down here."
"6908070","6909830"," Be really careful here if you're a bull."
"6915060","6917460"," You can see it down below this role here. "
"6917620","6919620"," See this white line and red line right here."
"6920840","6922420"," See how it's flattening right here."
"6922520","6923800"," It's not quite bullish yet. "
"6924000","6926760"," So that's more neutral."
"6926760","6927940"," But be really careful there."
"6940440","6940980"," Hey, King. "
"6941120","6941580"," How are you?"
"6944150","6945970"," I'm missing what you guys are saying."
"6946010","6947810"," I'm trying to go through the chat right now."
"6958630","6959610"," This is a good goddamn day. "
"6959650","6962070"," This is a good enough day where I don't even want to stream anymore."
"6964720","6965660"," I don't want to stream."
"6966820","6968940"," Come on. "
"6980850","6981590"," Do the thing do this."
"6981830","6983730"," This market is so fucking slow."
"6983990","6991280"," It's it's like moments or like five, 10, 20 minutes of just digging around. "
"6991780","6992820"," Like how long we've been sitting here for?"
"6993620","6994940"," This is 1146."
"6995580","6997340"," It's now 1216."
"6997880","6999520"," So half an hour of just this bullshit. "
"7005960","7006980"," Now let's talk about Tesla really quick."
"7007540","7008400"," Give me a quick second here."
"7008480","7009340"," I'll set up Tesla for you. "
"7010920","7020640"," I'll look at Tesla and I'll look at Tesla and GME."
"7025520","7026980"," The trigger screen here."
"7036630","7040530"," This Tesla 30 minute Tesla is just ramping right now. "
"7040670","7042850"," So the bullishness on Tesla."
"7043530","7045830"," I want you to draw your attention down here."
"7045950","7048150"," You know that we buy these bottoms on daily velocity. "
"7048810","7055470"," It's just starting to ramp on bullishness for the bulls on Tesla."
"7055970","7057790"," That orange bar that we had up here."
"7058210","7059630"," Now we had this charted out. "
"7059750","7065590"," I don't I don't know if we I don't know if we maybe we got rid of some of this"
"7065590","7066890"," yesterday or something like that."
"7066970","7068250"," I don't know why we deleted that."
"7069690","7070990"," Now I want to show you this. "
"7071070","7072190"," You got your tag right."
"7072490","7073410"," This is the orange bar."
"7073570","7074190"," You got your tag. "
"7075170","7077190"," We want to take a peek here and see."
"7078770","7079590"," Oh yeah, baby."
"7079650","7080150"," Roll it down. "
"7080150","7080830"," Roll it down."
"7081890","7082890"," So Tesla right."
"7083970","7086490"," We want to be looking for signs. "
"7087490","7090650"," We want to be looking what we're going to be looking for here is what I'm going to show you."
"7092190","7093630"," So on Tesla right."
"7098140","7099680"," I don't like this right here. "
"7100060","7104580"," I really have like to have seen this price squeeze up where I've been very bullish."
"7105420","7106720"," Didn't quite get that right."
"7108060","7109480"," Didn't catch it right here either. "
"7109480","7110840"," I mean kind of did."
"7111160","7113320"," I guess we could snap a line there and check it more closely."
"7113560","7114920"," We could get more scientific about it. "
"7115100","7118200"," But dude, bloody this motherfucker down."
"7118440","7119820"," Send this fucker down, dude."
"7120220","7121980"," Send fucking spy. "
"7122480","7123420"," Roll that shit over."
"7124440","7125760"," Now that Tesla is different."
"7125980","7128120"," Forget Tesla's not a part of spy in that case. "
"7128240","7128400"," Okay."
"7128960","7134160"," Now let me say it's just snap a line here and see if they got that new high back here."
"7134160","7136840"," Yeah, they didn't. "
"7138080","7140300"," You know, this shit's all kind of garbage here."
"7140560","7144240"," Like, like, I don't like seeing this shit."
"7144420","7145700"," I don't like seeing that shit. "
"7146520","7151240"," You really, if you're a bull, you really need to fucking beat that previous high."
"7151400","7152380"," Like, this is your nemesis."
"7152960","7155640"," This orange bar over here is your fucking nemesis. "
"7155960","7156600"," Like, you need to be."
"7158240","7160480"," You need to touch that fucker right there."
"7160600","7161140"," Not below it. "
"7161240","7161940"," You need to hit it."
"7164050","7166710"," Now does that mean that Tesla continues to go up from here?"
"7166890","7167070"," No."
"7168430","7172450"," It just means that you have, you live another day. "
"7172690","7173670"," So right there, right?"
"7174310","7179650"," So that price targets 247.49. Some of you probably like to see that 250 up here."
"7179950","7183570"," I can see you wanting that 250 just for some just for some oomph."
"7183590","7184170"," Yeah, we did it. "
"7185050","7186890"," But that's your target for Tesla."
"7186890","7188410"," So your Tesla targets this 250."
"7189110","7190990"," Now, once you hit that target, right?"
"7192410","7194770"," You've got some more to look at back here. "
"7195110","7198290"," And that's this one right here, this, this dotted line."
"7198810","7200590"," And you're going to, we're going to make that one a yellow."
"7200870","7206430"," So you really want to see like at least at least that right there. "
"7207770","7215780"," And then, and you know, a lot of time left as a Tesla bull right there."
"7216800","7218480"," You got another one right here."
"7224520","7226740"," But this is going to become a sell the news event, isn't it?"
"7227460","7228440"," You can already see it. "
"7231740","7233500"," And then up here is a big one."
"7233700","7236140"," I mean, you got fucking dude, you got so much volatility in Tesla."
"7236140","7237540"," It's like not even funny. "
"7237800","7238960"," You got another one right here."
"7239780","7240740"," I can get over that one."
"7241640","7243900"," And you got this big bad boy right here. "
"7247200","7248260"," That one's red."
"7249640","7251540"," This is the one they're going to try to fuck you on."
"7251540","7253420"," And they're going to try to fuck you on this one up here. "
"7255120","7255980"," This is 280."
"7266600","7267460"," This is a second here."
"7268720","7270580"," Oh, yeah, baby, print me some fucking puts. "
"7274120","7275240"," Here's your hourly trigger."
"7275460","7276420"," This is all good to see."
"7280520","7286240"," So I'd really like to see Tesla get up here and tag just that orange. "
"7287820","7291960"," Believe or not, come back down about halfway right here."
"7295500","7296680"," And then attack this one up here."
"7303020","7305380"," Some some wild ass price action here for Tesla. "
"7308580","7311140"," And I don't know if you need the news to get up there."
"7311280","7312900"," But anyways, you see my point, right?"
"7313080","7315100"," You're looking to trade that 247 and change."
"7316720","7324440"," If you're a bull in your Tesla bull, you need to stay above 236 63. "
"7324700","7326800"," And you have a bull cross coming up."
"7327460","7330080"," You've got this daily trigger crossing the weekly trigger."
"7330300","7336360"," This is going to be when when this cross comes, it's going to catapult you up here. "
"7337260","7339160"," Squeeze you up and then take you back down."
"7339320","7342020"," And likely you'll have an explosive move to the upside."
"7342440","7345040"," So still bullish on Tesla price target. "
"7345260","7346940"," You heard what I said to the other day."
"7346960","7348060"," It's way up here."
"7348840","7354380"," 293 89 on Teslas, the ultimate price target. "
"7354920","7356520"," We'll talk Tesla right now."
"7356520","7365940"," I said to you yesterday that I said to you yesterday that I gave you some of that news, right?"
"7369360","7370620"," Let's go back over here."
"7371440","7375380"," I gave you some of that news on Tesla yesterday. "
"7375660","7376920"," And I told you a couple things."
"7377780","7383280"," I didn't repeat some things that I told you in the beginning of last year."
"7384380","7388680"," And that or this past year, I think in January or March or something, I told you what's going to"
"7388680","7391660"," happen this December with the release of Cybertruck. "
"7392020","7396840"," Now, there's a couple of points that I haven't didn't harp on yesterday that we need to go over."
"7397100","7402220"," And then the first part of that is going to be, you get your December launch of Tesla Cybertruck."
"7403120","7413100"," You're you're likely going to see Elon discuss FSD level five, four and"
"7413100","7418720"," five, four Cybertruck in that event on Thursday, the high probability of it. "
"7419280","7427100"," And you're also likely going to hear down the road that they're going to have problems with"
"7427100","7427400"," deliveries."
"7427520","7429300"," But that's not going to be the focus tomorrow."
"7430040","7439740"," And that's like what's on my during market hours,"
"7439740","7442180"," basically, right, three PM Eastern Standard Time. "
"7442820","7444640"," And then you have the option to trade options."
"7445100","7451100"," There's some synthetic options that you could do that trade 24 hours a day, mostly almost 25 hours"
"7451100","7451280"," a day."
"7451360","7455940"," And then you got buying the underlying if they come out and say that. "
"7456120","7460840"," So if he comes out there and says something to you like, this is FSD four and five or something"
"7460840","7469200"," like that, you might get a pretty positive market reaction due to that conversation in that product"
"7469200","7469620"," launch."
"7469880","7477540"," I think it's the one thing in that product launch that could send the price of Tesla higher where"
"7477540","7478480"," it is in market hours."
"7479160","7482840"," But I'm going to give you a caveat on that would be that it's untrue. "
"7483420","7487980"," It's likely going to be untrue for another three to five years."
"7488760","7492540"," So whatever that squeeze is, I don't think it's sustainable."
"7493460","7500240"," And then the other part is I think they're going to tell you down the road, they're going to harp"
"7500240","7500540"," on. "
"7501440","7503540"," They're going to have problems with deliveries."
"7504280","7509740"," I think that the idea out there is that everyone's getting their cyber truck or it's public."
"7509940","7511720"," Everybody can just start buying them. "
"7511780","7513080"," And I don't think that's going to be the case either."
"7513080","7518540"," I think you're going to experience delays in delivery for a long period of time."
"7519760","7521700"," One to three years, believe it or not. "
"7522020","7525420"," I don't know if that's true, but that's what I think is going to happen."
"7525660","7532040"," So on this event, if you're looking for that squeeze higher, I would be looking for that"
"7532040","7535140"," conversation in that launch, that cyber truck launch."
"7535540","7536280"," Be looking for that. "
"7536440","7538960"," Hey, this is FSD five, four and five."
"7539740","7543900"," And if that hits, if that ends up hitting the wire, it's going to be a big deal."
"7544460","7545400"," Is it real though?"
"7546040","7547400"," No, I'm sorry. "
"7547600","7547980"," It is not."
"7548340","7550020"," It's a promise of it being real."
"7550480","7555460"," I don't know. "
"7555640","7557180"," I'm just looking for one more red bar down."
"7557520","7558640"," I made a bunch of money and puts yesterday."
"7559560","7561220"," I made a shit ton of money and puts yesterday. "
"7561920","7563960"," I only made pennies this morning on puts."
"7564340","7571820"," I had had puts yesterday that I printed it towards the bell and then I entered some more at like"
"7571820","7573360"," four 10 or something like that."
"7573380","7574640"," I bought some more puts for this morning. "
"7574900","7578860"," They were up only like three or four pennies, cut those loose, took some calls for this right up."
"7580040","7582220"," I'm only up a penny right now on puts."
"7582640","7585140"," So these, these puts aren't printing just yet. "
"7586200","7588880"," And I don't think that they do, I don't think that they print huge."
"7589100","7591640"," I think we just come up here and we tap right here."
"7592460","7593340"," And I think this holds. "
"7594340","7597580"," And I think this becomes a consolidation range."
"7597580","7598120"," Hold on here."
"7598880","7600520"," I don't think I'm not bearish here. "
"7600640","7607160"," I'm I'm more like I'm more like down, right?"
"7607500","7611240"," And then this nonsense over here, just grinding."
"7611660","7613080"," Do not fuck around in this."
"7613580","7616800"," This is this is going to be the death zone for bulls and bears in here. "
"7616800","7619720"," So do not get trapped in this once we go down here."
"7619860","7621660"," Okay, don't don't don't get trapped in there."
"7624880","7626360"," And here's your R1. "
"7626360","7628680"," This is likely where your bounce is going to be right in here."
"7630860","7633120"," This is like the finger trap in here."
"7633640","7634760"," So don't get caught in this. "
"7635000","7637580"," Don't get caught in like the blast down."
"7637580","7639180"," And then this nonsense in here."
"7639680","7641580"," That kind of bullshit that we swing high. "
"7645370","7646910"," Take the money and run off R1."
"7648770","7649590"," I'm only up."
"7649850","7651710"," I'm up one with two pennies right now. "
"7651710","7651710"," Now."
"7672130","7673230"," Apple testing."
"7673550","7675950"," It's a one twenty nine EMA right now. "
"7676390","7677630"," You should see a bounce."
"7677850","7682370"," If you are more bearish here, expect a bounce off this five minutes."
"7682610","7687510"," And then if you want that further bloodbath, it's likely going to be look like something like that"
"7687510","7687930"," right there. "
"7692550","7694810"," Trade nine right now and four fifty four."
"7721080","7721840"," Work my gork."
"7721960","7722520"," What's going on, brother?"
"7722720","7723800"," Question if you could help. "
"7724080","7725480"," Let me get out of this trade here for a minute."
"7725480","7726200"," No answer your question."
"7726420","7733080"," But if you could help before this put sale, if you can check my message about pattern day trade PT. "
"7733560","7735480"," Am I screwed there new to this sub task?"
"7735860","7738780"," Okay, so I don't know a lot about PDTs anymore."
"7739720","7741600"," I used to have I used to know a ton about it."
"7741740","7747840"," I've been told that you can't do this, but my understanding is that you can go to like tasty trade"
"7747840","7751380"," and open up like 10 or 12 cash accounts on one social security number. "
"7752200","7755780"," So if you're trading with like under twenty, well, number one, if you're trading, I think it's"
"7755780","7756860"," twenty five thousand cash, right?"
"7756980","7761400"," If you're under twenty five thousand dollars cash, you likely need like fifty thousand dollars in"
"7761400","7765260"," cash to be in a in accounts, believe it or even like what even though you hit like twenty five"
"7765260","7767420"," thousand, you'll slip in and out of PDT."
"7767420","7770260"," So you need like fifty thousand dollars not to hit that PDT."
"7771400","7776700"," What I would recommend to you not this is not financial advice. "
"7777400","7777980"," How about this?"
"7778200","7778860"," This is not advice."
"7779900","7782060"," If you don't have there's a couple of things here for you."
"7782060","7790660"," Number one, those rules are built for you in their their position, the position of the SEC and"
"7790660","7797640"," FINRA and the CMO and all that stuff is that you should be pre-thinking your trades out and only"
"7797640","7800800"," taking a trade that you're 100% sure is going to print. "
"7801500","7805340"," So if you're sloppy running around just burning money left and right and all that kind of stuff,"
"7805700","7807640"," you shouldn't be fucking trading."
"7810800","7813860"," That's you should be paper trading until."
"7814160","7817100"," Oh yeah, baby blood in the marketplace right now blood. "
"7822860","7829040"," Oh blood, baby."
"7829800","7832320"," I'm still fucking on cop puts right now."
"7839390","7842030"," I just sold all these fucking puts. "
"7845610","7846810"," I'm out."
"7847070","7848810"," I'm out of out of out of out of your puts."
"7849670","7851650"," You might have one more bar down here. "
"7853190","7857640"," Yeah dude that was fucking gangster."
"7858380","7861460"," All right so I'm flat right now."
"7861500","7861840"," I'm out. "
"7861840","7863160"," I'm fucking flat."
"7866640","7867960"," Yeah get your money and get out."
"7868120","7871560"," So Bork, I'm going to tell you this okay. "
"7875580","7876740"," Bork, I'm going to tell you this."
"7877360","7879600"," Those rules though, fuck with your brain."
"7880180","7881440"," They're like those rules. "
"7882220","7886740"," What that would happen to you is this is that you don't want to get your PDT's like your three"
"7886740","7888400"," or four PDT's whatever it is."
"7888520","7892060"," So you're like oh I'm in amount, I'm in amount, I'm in amount, I'm in amount and then you burn"
"7892060","7894240"," through them and you've always got the specter in the back of your head."
"7894360","7900060"," So it's like an inverse what they want to happen to you like or what they want you to think"
"7900060","7905740"," about doing in the right way which is paper fucking trade until you're consistently a good trader. "
"7905920","7910420"," That means you make seven out of ten good trades, winning trades, seven out of ten."
"7911020","7915380"," You can get by with five or six but you want to be seven out of ten on paper trading"
"7915380","7915620"," okay."
"7915900","7924900"," Seven out of ten winners and do it do it do a a book hold that you have yourself a"
"7924900","7928660"," book and you write down your book I won I won I won I won I won I lost I"
"7928660","7932780"," won and you need to be about seven seven out of ten paper trading okay. "
"7933260","7940040"," If you're not a seven out of ten trader on paper trading you have no business trading no business"
"7940040","7945720"," investing you have no fucking business so that's rule number fucking one okay."
"7946160","7949740"," Rule number one you need to be a winner paper trading seven out of ten times."
"7950360","7955680"," Every time like you do ten trades you're seven out of ten you do another ten you're seven out of"
"7955680","7957220"," ten you do 30 trades right. "
"7958020","7960580"," You're what you're 21 out of 30 right."
"7961240","7965580"," I don't care if you lose seven in a row and then you make 21 in a row right."
"7965820","7969880"," I'm sorry I said I get the math wrong I think but you get the point right you have to"
"7969880","7974960"," be consistently seven out of ten trader if you're not a seven out of ten trader paper trading you"
"7974960","7983420"," have no fucking business trading is any money in this marketplace paper trading is not the same as"
"7983420","7988000"," real money trading so you're going to make even more mistakes does that make sense to keep you like"
"7988000","7994400"," a five five out of ten six out of ten trader especially being a new trader now that that that"
"7994400","8000940"," uh aura or that aura but that that's specter behind you from PDT rules is something that you really"
"8000940","8008380"," don't want uh while you're trading either so what I would say to you would be not financial advice"
"8008380","8014740"," not advice at all uh now people have told me you can't do this anymore but from my experience in"
"8014740","8020080"," the past you could go to tasty trade open up two three four five cash accounts and you can run"
"8020080","8025980"," those into PDT violations and just go to another account and start trading again and you can take"
"8025980","8030900"," your money now what that does is this it makes sure it ensures that you get out of a bad"
"8030900","8036960"," trade rather than staying in it because of PDT rules you cut your losses and run right you don't"
"8036960","8041240"," worry about PDT and then what you can do is take the money that's left over in your accounts and"
"8041240","8047160"," you can um not a CH but uh you can a CH if you want to pay the fees you"
"8047160","8052800"," can ask your bank and tasty or your broker whatever broker you're using ask them for the fee with"
"8052800","8058360"," fee waivers and move your money from account to account to account to account like I understand the"
"8058360","8066560"," point behind why uh they have those rules but it does uh it does um mentally and emotionally really"
"8066560","8072460"," tie your hands uh in your trading style what I notice in new traders is they think about the PDT"
"8072460","8078100"," rule so they stay in their trade longer than they should if your thesis is wrong you cut your"
"8078100","8083360"," losses and move on to the next fucking trade you have to uh if you've got PDT rules you're like"
"8083360","8087700"," well I'm going to stay into it until it burns the fucking zero right you're going to be fucked as"
"8087700","8095340"," a matter of fact uh I cut out 457s right I cut 457s they went to like what one two"
"8095340","8099980"," three pennies at one point on that downside move right if I'd stayed in that trade I would have"
"8099980","8109160"," gotten torched for five six thousand dollars and I cut that fucker loose in a bad trades or if"
"8109160","8112900"," you're like hey this is my thesis we're going up we're down and in the moment we get to this"
"8112900","8120600"," number in the opposite direction I cut myself out of that trade right you listen to the way I'm"
"8120600","8126860"," telling you right now um so if you're trading the market with real cash right now bork and you're"
"8126860","8133680"," not winning seven out of ten trades five six seven out of ten trades with cash you have no business"

"8301549","8308170"," if you are a bull and you think we're going higher you're looking for uh you're looking for price"
"8308170","8314030"," to break above right new high come back down believe it or"
"8314030","8324950"," not and"
"8324950","8334940"," then you can take you know I never paper traded but I"
"8334940","8339480"," think it's a good thing to do I only only think if I have paper trade I might have paper"
"8339480","8344879"," traded I'm not sure but I think paper trading is a good thing for people to do are you what"
"8344879","8352160"," I also like about paper trading whenever I learned a new system like whenever I started like when I"
"8352160","8359700"," started trading butterflies I like like read everything about butterflies and then I didn't"
"8359700","8366379"," understand it completely I didn't understand how to manage a butterfly either so what happened to"
"8366379","8373920"," me was opened a butterfly right and opened a butterfly to buy and I had to work through the"
"8373920","8380700"," mechanics of it the same thing applies with all spreads you start to learn like you can like learn"
"8380700","8387000"," everything you want about greeks but uh really really through trading with real money do you learn"
"8387000","8392260"," uh or I learned how what the like put the third piece of the puzzle together right you read a"
"8392260","8397640"," book watch the video and then when you actually trade it with low money you actually it it finally"
"8397640","8404080"," makes sense you know like I get it now um so when I was younger I don't know that I"
"8404080","8412220"," traded with paper trading but um if I was a young trader I think just for the mechanics of how"
"8412220","8420880"," a trade works um over time and price will teach you a lot about um as as a matter of"
"8420880","8427820"," fact too one last caveat to this would be even if it's a losing trade sometime especially if it's a"
"8427820","8435540"," complex trade it's still sometimes good to stay in that trade in the last possible moment before"
"8435540","8442300"," expiry now that doesn't mean you leave them to expiry because you can get assigned uh but let's say"
"8442300","8449520"," you have a spread that uh uh uh let's give a spread let's give a butterfly that um expires today"
"8449520","8454080"," you would close that spread it like at the at the least at the most like 4.15 in the"
"8454080","8459600"," afternoon for 3.59 or something like that thing on the brokerage that you use if they allow you to"
"8459600","8466400"," trade to that time period um but even even if it's a loser because sometimes those trades will"
"8466400","8472840"," print for you right at expiry even if you're upside down so just learning uh how you make and lose"
"8472840","8479800"," money in those trades and the the mechanics that work in and in against your favor uh in a given"
"8479800","8487310"," time period to expire you're important for a new trader to learn I'm flat right now I'm not doing"
"8487310","8493130"," anything uh if you're looking for if you're looking to short this from here what you're going to be"
"8493130","8499790"," looking for is a rejection I'm going to draw it out for you what you're looking for hold on you"
"8501160","8508220"," are looking for a rejection right here it might squeeze up to here you're looking for this move"
"8508220","8515340"," below the hourly trigger right and then you're going to be looking for um something like this right"
"8515340","8524040"," here let's see looking for this rejection now this rejection could start here and you might"
"8524040","8532880"," actually get this move down here and come back up so right now no I think this is consolidation so"
"8532880","8540820"," I this looks like ping pong in a trap if I was going to take a short here personally I"
"8540820","8548150"," would be looking for um hold on here I don't like any trade right here I don't like any trade"
"8548150","8554730"," if I was looking for a trade here I'd be looking for uh a break underneath and then for this"
"8554730","8563190"," swooping motion and then maybe jump on it right there or more downside I don't like any trade here"
"8563190","8567950"," at all to be honest with you you you might get this last little bit I guess you could take"
"8567950","8575470"," that one right there but even if you tap this there's no trade it's not enough for me puts aren't"
"8575470","8579510"," puts you need a move you need to get a like you need to get a move like this one"
"8579510","8584990"," you need to get a substantial downside move and I don't know that you're getting that substantial"
"8584990","8590850"," downside move on this part of the trade so no that's because we're a positive gamma right now"
"8590850","8597630"," there's no fucking money and puts even this even this money I just made it was still kind of"
"8597630","8607680"," garbage it wasn't like a knock out knock out of the park 80 000"

"10819960","10827200"," to you okay if uh if price breaks breaks below we flip it over for bears okay pretend this chart"
"10827200","10832160"," is upside down right now let me matter of fact let me just switch this chart upside down hold on"
"10832160","10837380"," let me say it switches upside down uh now this doesn't guarantee it but because you need to recheck"
"10837380","10843940"," it so bears need to recheck this hourly trigger so you'll likely come back up and we'll pound and"
"10843940","10849440"," then head lower okay now if this was bullish i'd say the same thing to you so let me see"
"10849440","10859760"," if i can let me see if i can hold up okay so"

"10890540","10896500"," yeah there we go so pretend the market's upside down right now if you're a bull okay this was"
"10896500","10902820"," upside down what you'd be looking for here is you see how that one in five-minute coming up right"
"10902820","10909680"," that's going to be a bear cross with a with a three-trigger bear cross now if this was bullish"
"10909680","10917280"," you'd be expecting a pretty big move this way here okay because of the hourly trigger the one of"
"10917280","10924360"," the five-minute right here okay now because this is bearish it's inverse right so these bears these"
"10924360","10931720"," sellers want to confirm the move is going to be lower and head like this okay does that make sense"
"10931720","10939340"," consolidation then i move down so just like this one and two and then just like that okay now on"
"10939340","10944720"," the inverse let me see if i can switch this transform this transform this back flip this back again"
"10944720","10953920"," flip vertical now if you're a bull now i flip the screen back over for you just now if you're"
"10953920","10960020"," a bull right you can't take a trade here you can take like a five-minute trade on the one "
"10960020","10965400","-minute or something like that but you can take this trade but the truth is you really can't take a"
"10965400","10974670"," trade unless i'm going to show you what you need to see happen so you need to see that over"
"10974670","10984640"," there you need to see this white turn around you need to see price blast"
"10986080","10995820"," up here you can consolidate and begin to make its way higher and you take the trade right here"
"10997920","11002800"," now if you are like hey i'm going to try to try to dip buy down here and think that"
"11002800","11007840"," might be bottom i would also if you're like hey i want to try to time a bottom i always"
"11007840","11016500"," like to see a flattening first of the white and red line so if you start to see price stay"
"11016500","11021100"," down here and you start to see this white line flatten and price hasn't come up when this red line"
"11021100","11025940"," starts flatten yeah you could possibly put some risk on that could be an early indicator that price"
"11025940","11031300"," is going to go up if you get trapped in here you kind of fuck so i'll explain this more"
"11031300","11036280"," in detail on videos that i've recorded for you but it's very dangerous for a bull here right now"

"11043340","11050480"," more downside just a moment so we'll likely see price come up and more downside to come and trade"

"16087300","16094900"," was saying if we spend too much time on hourly trigger that's bearish uh not necessarily so uh the"
"16094900","16103460"," more time we spend on the hourly trigger it's actually more bullish uh the less time we spend on"
"16103460","16111260"," this uh hourly trigger we start to reject and come down right and start to head down quickly it's"
"16111260","16115740"," it's pretty bearish the more time we actually spend on this hourly trigger the more the more"

"16157560","16164460"," uh to open up the market we need put expansion as well uh because the put wall is very the"
"16164460","16173020"," put wall right now is down here at uh 4 4 52 we can see the coiling taking place right"
"16173020","16181280"," here right major coiling here we also have end of month coming up right we know much time left say"
"16181280","16190020"," is the 28th 29th and then the 30th something else that's fascinating too is sometimes end of month"

"16197580","16204500"," outsized move it's possible the expiration will do that as well get you some outside moves we know"
"16204500","16209840"," that today's Tuesday this is where they fake you out as part of that conversation this morning is"
"16209840","16214320"," this manipulation day we're talking with david ams yesterday and i was like yeah i'm bearish into"
"16214320","16222020"," tomorrow possibly even wednesday morning uh but that bearishness is fake out for an upside move"
"16222940","16229240"," right uh if you guys don't know what manipulation is right here it's when the uh banks or like a"
"16229240","16234800"," bank will make their trade here and they'll fake you out so that you don't know where we're going"
"16234800","16241780"," and then we actually make the move later into the week now we're parked right here at 455 we"
"16241780","16248700"," probably can take a guess here with all those four 4,600 calls for end of the month that we're"
"16248700","16257300"," likely going to close on friday up here at this uh 4,600 that's the that's the imped uh that's"
"16257300","16263360"," what we think right that all that these banks are uh long on these call spreads whatever you have"
"16263360","16266940"," it out there whoever it is that's long in these calls whoever it is that owns those things that"
"16266940","16273120"," they want these fuckers to print about uh into the end of the month over here so they're so we're"
"16273120","16278680"," still like you can see that they're selling this early before we got there they sold it they sold"
"16278680","16283260"," it and if we come back up into friday and to friday we're going to try to sell that again"
"16283260","16290940"," right sell into that bullishness at 460 and then after at the end of the month it's 12-1 right"
"16290940","16296260"," some kind of an expectation of a roll into december that's what's being pushed the narrative that's"
"16296260","16303860"," being pushed and you also got that note this or that note from gs saying that bulls have about five"
"16303860","16310840"," sessions one two three four and five and we should start we we have we have a window of weakness"
"16310840","16317300"," in the first week of maybe the second week of december uh some of these guys are claiming like"
"16317300","16325360"," market doom 1987 crash after this uh session right i don't know how true that is if you get some"
"16325360","16331280"," weakness into the beginning of the month and then you start seeing call uh call input expansion we"
"16331280","16339580"," could definitely still have more christmas run for uh december i wouldn't take that as a gospel so"

"16384330","16392740"," now so you know it's coiling consolidation we haven't had any distribution yet it's not as bearish"
"16392740","16399279"," as you think uh it can get bearish as we head into next week we start that roll down but"
"16399279","16405279"," for right now we're still on track for that 4600 into that that pin strike i don't know if this"
"16405279","16411460"," happens like this i don't know i don't know if it happens and then we roll down into this something"
"16411460","16418880"," like that but right now we haven't sold uh to the downside if we're if i said this yesterday as"

"16961830","16967650"," out there that's selling into us they're likely going to continue to do that as much as much as"

"16973830","16979150"," the mission accomplished shit uh the back of my brain i don't i talked about it briefly a couple"

"16984290","16992170"," i'm like man i'm like that i revealed that under very yield curve i know that they have a they"
"16992170","16998410"," have a rate decision in december the 11th and 12th right i think we're getting a fuck i swear to"
"16998410","17003290"," i think we're getting a rate hike so now i do i i really believe at this point we're going"
"17003290","17007130"," to get a rate hike in middle of december i don't know if that's a damper on the market or"
"17007130","17012050"," not but that's what i'm thinking i'm thinking we're going to get a rate hike now historically i"
"17012050","17016470"," haven't gotten the book yet i didn't reach out yesterday but i'm going to grab this book and the"
"17016470","17023750"," book is a stock market almanac and in that book they were talking about if they don't raise rates"
"17023750","17032250"," this decision then we're done historically we're done if they go five rate decisions without a rate"
"17032250","17037870"," increase historically that means we're never raising rates again you can see that being priced into"
"17037870","17044830"," the market you know that expectation and that could be the trigger for the market to go to 480 so"
"17044830","17051530"," if you're a bull on 480 for end of year i want you to think about this that that power"
"17051530","17057850"," rate decision in december right i think it's the 11th and 12th that would propel us to that 4800"
"17057850","17064830"," for end of month or even right when it happens if that happens i want to tell you guys something"
"17064830","17069510"," right now okay i want you to think about this and i'll show you some historical examples of this"
"17069510","17079290"," oftentimes if that is perceived as the last rate increase you could see a liquidity grab move"
"17079290","17085390"," to the upside only to sell this market hard and heavy to the downside now i'm not going to do"
"17085390","17089190"," it today for you well maybe i'll do it over the weekend or on a friday or a slow day"
"17089190","17094970"," or something but i need to show you guys um i need to show you guys some some data on"
"17094970","17103790"," soft landings hard landings and what happens about 70 to 80 percent of the time whenever we know or"
"17103790","17111470"," there's an anticipation that rate hikes are done they'll front run a big downside move and they can"
"17111470","17118650"," grab liquidity to do it so that's down the road that's into the beginning of next year but that"
"17118650","17126190"," would be a precursor and some kind of a uh a fire starter or a spark for us to trade"
"17126190","17132750"," that 4800 at the end of the year so that catalyst is likely going to be the fed rate decision"
"17132750","17138490"," on the 11th 12th that could trigger that moment now i don't know if anyone will talk about that"
"17138490","17142730"," publicly too much uh in social media on the news i'm going to get you that shit i'm going to"
"17142730","17148450"," show it to you guys the actual data but that would be what i'm thinking of would be if if"
"17148450","17154030"," he doesn't raise rates at that next rate decision uh historically that's the last one that we have"
"17154030","17160170"," this would be a break from the norm if we don't raise rates and continue to raise in future rate"
"17160170","17168280"," decisions it'd be the first time historically that that's happened no if you do no so if you did"
"17168280","17174800"," not in the rate decision if you do not get do not get a rate hike historically that means we"
"17174800","17181460"," will not get another rate hike that we're done raising rates we're done now there's some stuff to"
"17181460","17189260"," talk about that if the yield curve uninverts they don't have a vehicle right um uh they don't they"
"17189260","17192500"," don't like what are they going to do the only thing they can do if the yield curve uninverts right"
"17192500","17196960"," uh they're trying to remove liquidity from the system the only way they can do it is through rate"
"17196960","17206790"," hikes so um it's going to be a tough one uh"
"17206790","17211790"," you know my thoughts on this i think they're out of their fucking minds if they think they're gonna"
"17211790","17217490"," be well it's just their other fucking minds i think that they should raise rates hold rates and"
"17217490","17227390"," raise rates i think that they should i just don't think that they will and i"
"17227390","17233990"," see the damage being done uh the the research i'm doing right now i'm seeing that damage i'm seeing"
"17233990","17240630"," that i'm seeing it it's there uh the damage is being done we have probably and likely broken"
"17240630","17246530"," something although it's going to take some time for it to show itself it's likely going to take a"
"17246530","17253470"," year to three years to show the breaks of what's taking place uh but my point going back to that"
"17253470","17259470"," original question that you had there if we do not get a rate hike if we do not right we"
"17259470","17265570"," make or could or may see a liquidity grab to the upside so we swoop up right hit that 4800"
"17265570","17271830"," and then they trigger that that that mark that huge market sell uh for the for next year in a"
"17271830","17277470"," front running for a big downside move i'm also going to show you where we don't have that downside"
"17277470","17285110"," move where we actually squeeze up into that 4800 back check uh back check the um previous high from"
"17285110","17291290"," January 2022 and then we continue to the upside like not that's the soft landing those don't happen"
"17291290","17298530"," too frequently but we are due for one historically in uh in rate cycles we go three or four rate"
"17298530","17305070"," cycles with hard landings let me get one soft landing i think we have three soft landing examples i"
"17305070","17309070"," think there's one in the 1960s one in the 90s i don't remember the other one was off the top"
"17309070","17323230"," of my head but we are due for one so this rate decision is going to be very important now"
"17323230","17330670"," if they do raise rates right if they do raise rates in the short term it can be very bearish"
"17330670","17339150"," uh for the market but in the medium term it will actually be bullish to sideways and up those"
"17339150","17344410"," actions that i was talking about like a big squeeze up the 4800 sell it fucking huge sell down for"
"17344410","17351090"," soft landing eat software hard uh like all those functions get pushed down the road now they'll"
"17351090","17358210"," wait to front run that action until he does pause permanently and begin to anticipate rate cuts"
"17358210","17363830"," down the road and i'll show you the i'll show you this data in i'll show you the data i'll"
"17363830","17369570"," show it to you on a chart with uh rate cuts historically all that kind of stuff soft landing hard"
"17369570","17374970"," landings uh all that stuff for you all i'll show you all that stuff so you can see the data"
"17374970","17379390"," to prove to prove this point i've showed you some of this in the past but i got i got"
"17379390","17386030"," better shit to show you uh down the road so this is going to be important into december second week"
"17386030","17391890"," of of december uh this rate this upcoming rate decision in the back of my mind i'm thinking that he"
"17391890","17399030"," might do a surprise hike um if he got the 4600 but there's no need for him too uh there's"
"17399030","17404350"," no there really isn't any need at this point if he is going to um i guess he could but"
"17404350","17408730"," like some kind of like surprise but like we're so close to a rate decision what the fuck is the"
"17408730","17414490"," point right it's fucking the 28th of devember he's got two weeks it's not like it's a month down"
"17414490","17418350"," the road or three months down the road or something like that or he had a plan for it or"
"17418350","17424630"," there's something major catalyst out there other than price of the stock market for that to take"
"17424630","17429950"," place um but we're going to pay attention to it as it takes place and i'm gonna set you up"
"17429950","17439670"," the details before you even get there yeah i you know i gotta be honest with you guys in the"
"17439670","17449060"," i was kind of on the soft or i would say this let me say this i'm behind the soft"
"17449060","17458360"," landing if it was higher for longer um but i think they've broken shit i do i do i was"
"17458360","17464780"," reading stories about people i'm reading stories about people refinancing to pay off debt um i hate"
"17464780","17470680"," percent cheaper than 30 percent someone mentioned the other day but that shit never ends well man"
"17470680","17476280"," like that stuff does not end well there's we see the unemployment rate rising right now it doesn't"
"17476280","17480760"," mean anything right now but it is going to mean something uh about a year from now we should be"
"17480760","17485920"," at about six percent unemployment those guys are always late to the fucking party the fed the"
"17485920","17491880"," treasury department uh they'll be chasing that shit if we if we start ramping like that so i'm on"
"17491880","17497260"," the fence right now on soft landing or hard landing i really am and whether they're pricing in a"
"17497260","17502260"," softer hard landing has nothing to do with whether we have one or not that's something else i want"
"17502260","17507740"," i haven't brought up that i wanted to talk about which was um the soft and hard landing like hey"
"17507740","17511320"," they're pricing in a soft landing right now doesn't mean we're not gonna that we're gonna have a"
"17511320","17516480"," soft landing these are gamblers that are fucking gambling pricing this shit in and they price in"
"17516480","17520940"," the other side they got like if they fart right and think we're gonna get a hard landing there's no"
"17520940","17526880"," problem with uh them betting the entire other direction of us not having a soft landing so be weary"
"17526880","17535820"," be weary of uh the betting that goes on with a hard and soft landing i still think it's unknown"
"17535820","17542080"," right now if we're getting a harder soft landing um and if they can if they hold rates higher for"
"17542080","17548600"," longer over time and from my perspective it looks like um they should i don't think that they will"
"17548600","17555660"," but they should um i think you're fucked i think from to think like all the unions getting higher"
"17555660","17564360"," rate uh wages from the un from the uh uh minimum wage being raised from the price of goods not"
"17564360","17571120"," coming down this looks embedded in this this this looks embedded and it looks permanent uh you"
"17571120","17574920"," don't you'll ever see another 10 cent hamburger ever again the rest of your life unless we're in"
"17574920","17582600"," fucking depression or something right um he just not they're lying to you in my view they're"
"17582600","17587280"," fucking lying too they're lying to you they're lying to me uh and we're just starting a whole"
"17587720","17593920"," another cycle uh we're starting a whole another cycle just like when i was a kid right um when i"
"17593920","17600000"," was like when i was young right uh my first job i made i think twenty dollars and hours with"
"17600000","17606200"," great pay at that point but most people weren't making that money they were making 10-12 bucks um"
"17606200","17612200"," but you know a lot of those a lot of those people in that job that i did still are"
"17612200","17619640"," still making 20 dollars to about uh right before covid so um i think they're fun i think and i"
"17619640","17624640"," think if you come back here in a decade and we were to go to like a McDonald's in order"
"17624640","17633300"," a burger it's going to be the prices now are higher um so it's it's it's it's the same argument"
"17633300","17640060"," we've had here for three years right by time so that you can uh be fed are you fed enough"
"17640060","17645220"," of the higher prices that you're eventually going to accept them over time can they do something"
"17645220","17651980"," can something happen or they do something to drop prices sure but it's very unlikely it hasn't been"
"17651980","17657420"," like that since 1978 so uh i'm going to go with i'm going to go if they're going to fail"
"17657420","17662060"," and declare victory and all that kind of stuff uh you're going to be living with those prices uh"
"17662060","17667020"," for a long time and you're going to see wages get raised over the next uh five ten years uh"
"17667020","17672540"," to match up with the cost of that stuff and you'll see young people uh be be force fed that"
"17672540","17676840"," everything's going to be fine we're going to raise your way wages over the next 10 20 years to deal"
"17676840","17684720"," with that um that's sticky inflation it looks like a whole new cycle to me so um that whole new"
"17684720","17695930"," fresh cycle out there yeah yeah i know it's bad yeah i"
"17695930","17701110"," break up i'm saying right now minimum wage was 235 when i started working in 1976 i'm telling you"
