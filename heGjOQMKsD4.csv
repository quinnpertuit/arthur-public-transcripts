"heGjOQMKsD4","0","3600"," on a focus and sound level before the film begins."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3600","5500"," Okay, I have a lot of hair."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5500","6800"," I can't hear anything."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6800","10800"," Check one, two, check."
"heGjOQMKsD4","10800","18800"," Check one, two, check one, two."
"heGjOQMKsD4","18800","26800"," And the break is because..."
"heGjOQMKsD4","48800","55800"," that you're doing out there"
"heGjOQMKsD4","55800","58800"," and what's going on out there how y'all doing"
"heGjOQMKsD4","58800","62800"," is everybody doing out there good to see everybody"
"heGjOQMKsD4","62800","69800"," they can actually see some comments"
"heGjOQMKsD4","70300","76800"," oh yeah save that okay I think I got that all under control"
"heGjOQMKsD4","76800","87800"," oh yeah baby what's going on we had a breakthrough thank you we had a breakthrough on the website"
"heGjOQMKsD4","87800","94800"," we think last night and then this morning a little bit more confirmation so"
"heGjOQMKsD4","94800","104800"," themes like things are on track for where they want to go okay so let me just send that out"
"heGjOQMKsD4","104800","112800"," so we got a lot to talk about today we have a ton of talk about I do want to preface this conversation with"
"heGjOQMKsD4","112800","127800"," please follow trade the trigger the handle on not YouTube on Twitter so let me see if I can post it in the chat or something"
"heGjOQMKsD4","127800","141800"," you should be following that here that trade the trigger the reason you should be following that handle is because with me not currently streaming"
"heGjOQMKsD4","141800","147800"," I've been spending a portion of my time"
"heGjOQMKsD4","147800","155800"," here a portion of my time researching every day and giving updates as to where we are in the marketplace"
"heGjOQMKsD4","155800","166800"," hey how you doing twitch good to see everybody here from twitch so the reason I'm saying that too is because"
"heGjOQMKsD4","166800","176800"," the reason I'm saying that too is because making these posts on our website and I'm posting links on Twitter directly to those posts"
"heGjOQMKsD4","176800","186800"," so that you can read them and have a firm idea of where we are in the marketplace so if you're looking for like hey why isn't cap streaming"
"heGjOQMKsD4","186800","196800"," as a base case number one working with developers right now trying to get a website launched and we're hitting bottlenecks as we try to launch"
"heGjOQMKsD4","196800","209800"," each one of these bottlenecks is requiring me to be there and help to get through those bottlenecks because a lot of work that needs to be done for it to be right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","209800","216800"," and so we should have that squeeze higher now we're going to talk about this squeeze we're going to talk about what makes this squeeze important"
"heGjOQMKsD4","217800","225800"," I think I labeled this video market crash or thread the needle and this is right now a function of threading the needle"
"heGjOQMKsD4","225800","233800"," so we're going to talk about threading that needle and escaping a market crash today we're going to talk about that specifically today"
"heGjOQMKsD4","233800","241800"," because the time is running out we've got three to five sessions of escaping it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","241800","253800"," and eight now seven right it's one more day last though six to nine sessions for queues and SPX to escape"
"heGjOQMKsD4","253800","265800"," so like so like even with even that time frame like that six to nine sessions three of those five of those three to five of those will need to be spent"
"heGjOQMKsD4","265800","277800"," with the market squeezing balls off like like ripping for three straight days to get to that point of escaping a market crash"
"heGjOQMKsD4","277800","286800"," now we're going to talk today about whenever this happens if this is it today if it's today tomorrow next day when it begins to happen"
"heGjOQMKsD4","286800","297800"," we're going to talk about the pitfalls of that squeeze and if that squeeze rejects because that if that squeeze rejects"
"heGjOQMKsD4","297800","309800"," on the daily trigger and the daily trigger begins to cross the weekly trigger we are in some deep shit like deep you can forget the correction you can throw that out the window you can throw"
"heGjOQMKsD4","309800","316800"," anything out the window and we will experience some kind of a flash crash"
"heGjOQMKsD4","316800","321800"," now there's no we're not at that point where you can confirm that's going to happen"
"heGjOQMKsD4","321800","330800"," but it's there so we're going to analyze it today we're going to take a look at what to look for if it does happen"
"heGjOQMKsD4","330800","342800"," and with some some downside targets and they're vicious those downside targets are not pretty so we'll we'll look at those downside targets today we'll look at what to look for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","342800","348800"," if we do get that crash now there are some mechanics in the background that say that ain't going to happen"
"heGjOQMKsD4","348800","359800"," if you look at like the 10 year yield is I think believe is that 4.88 today so if it hits that five that magic number five percent or has a double top up there"
"heGjOQMKsD4","359800","374800"," you get like 4.88 then you get like five then it rolls you could see a turn in the marketplace and the other thing here is that the 10 year is not what you should be watching for the market to go up or down"
"heGjOQMKsD4","374800","384800"," it is not relevant to whether the market goes up or down the 10 the 20 and the 30 you cannot there is no correlation to the market going up or down"
"heGjOQMKsD4","384800","392800"," believe it or not sometimes it correlates and sometimes it doesn't one of the best correlations you can look at are the two and three year"
"heGjOQMKsD4","392800","398800"," those are risk on appetites in the market they tend to follow the market more closely"
"heGjOQMKsD4","398800","404800"," now the yield curve and the inverted yield curve that's not actually a good indicator either"
"heGjOQMKsD4","405800","416800"," and I read a read a note was or an email was passed to me yesterday and for all the wine and the bitching that I see I'm fintuit right now that's another whole other topic"
"heGjOQMKsD4","416800","427800"," I can't believe some of the shit that I read the garbage that I read from people on fintuit about how bad life is especially people that are fucking millionaires"
"heGjOQMKsD4","427800","438800"," I'm not going to name names here but I got there's passed an email yesterday I read through it and it was a millionaire whining and I got no fucking sympathy for a millionaire whining"
"heGjOQMKsD4","438800","449800"," and he was like a self aware wolf I don't know if you know what a self aware wolf is but it's when they wine and bitch or not wine and bitch when somebody"
"heGjOQMKsD4","449800","463800"," proves their argument that they're trying to make against whatever they're arguing so the example here is this guy owns this guy owns a self storage unit"
"heGjOQMKsD4","463800","475800"," this guy owns a he owns more than one unit owns a bunch of self storage units and his posit was well my occupants well first of all he was bitching about how bad the economy is"
"heGjOQMKsD4","475800","481800"," and the damage is being done and everything is horrible and the market is going to crash because of where we are"
"heGjOQMKsD4","481800","495800"," and then he was trying to make or justify that rationale right we've got 5% on the 10 year and everything is terrible"
"heGjOQMKsD4","495800","504800"," and we're going to get a market crash and I'm going to use these reasons for why and one of the this is the self aware wolf part"
"heGjOQMKsD4","504800","520800"," he said my occupancy rates and my storage units are down to 66% from a high of 86 or any of you that don't know out there you want about 70% an average of about 70% and you're making money"
"heGjOQMKsD4","520800","524800"," anything above that you're making killer money"
"heGjOQMKsD4","524800","546800"," now if things were that bad he would have an 80 or 90% occupancy rate in his storage unit what he's talking about is not a sign of damage being done to or crippling damage being done to people"
"heGjOQMKsD4","546800","554800"," I need you out there watching to understand that if someone's bitching and whining on fin to it anywhere I don't care"
"heGjOQMKsD4","554800","572800"," Reddit they're whining on AM radio they're whining in newspaper articles whatever garbage you're being fed out there whining doesn't matter if you're working right one job two jobs if your wife or your husband"
"heGjOQMKsD4","572800","582800"," is working if you're living in your parents home in the basement in the basement suite you're still kind of getting by"
"heGjOQMKsD4","582800","596800"," it's only when you don't get by any longer where you do declare bankruptcy where your house is foreclosed on where they start to take these things from you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","597800","614800"," that there's actual pain where you lose your job you're not rehireable because they hire somebody younger you lose your wife and your dogs your cat your kids and you go sleep in your fucking truck that's what you do"
"heGjOQMKsD4","614800","632800"," you sleep on your truck and you try to find work and your shit either gets sold or gets put into guess what a storage unit and storage units should be booming right now if the damage has been done"
"heGjOQMKsD4","632800","642800"," further around that point rents should be booming right now if people are actually losing their homes that's not happening rents are coming down"
"heGjOQMKsD4","642800","652800"," this guy that I just read from this guy that I trust that I believe this guy this is like an email exchange not quite a twitter post this is actually a group of rich people talk to each other"
"heGjOQMKsD4","653800","667800"," so this this guy's like self-aware wolver in my viewpoint here he's whining because he's not fucking making money and he's trying to correlate that with the state of the economy"
"heGjOQMKsD4","667800","678800"," in fact this guy if the economy was shit in the bed would be making a ton of money specifically through those storage units so I don't think the damage is done"
"heGjOQMKsD4","679800","694800"," another point here would be Bill Ackman, Jamie Dimon, by the way Jamie Dimon and Mook Wilson, Mike Wilson, Mick Wilson will call him Mick and Dimon"
"heGjOQMKsD4","694800","702800"," all have three different takes on where we are right now if you listen to the three of them right now speak they all have different takes"
"heGjOQMKsD4","702800","708800"," you've got Jamie saying something like we gotta go to seven basis points, the damage isn't done"
"heGjOQMKsD4","708800","717800"," you've got Bill Ackman saying we ain't getting any more rate hikes we're done you'll be lucky if we get another 2-5"
"heGjOQMKsD4","717800","725800"," you got Mike Wilson out there saying you're fucked we're gonna get stuck in a"
"heGjOQMKsD4","726800","741800"," the exact words he said was a purgatory and we're gonna trade sideways and in this range bound like this 420 to 450 while we wait and see the effects of the rate increases in the fed"
"heGjOQMKsD4","742800","755800"," taken together those three guys and their statements in the last two weeks come back to my take on Jerome Powell's fucking rate decision"
"heGjOQMKsD4","755800","766800"," and it's bearing itself out there right now with these talking heads they're not in agreement with Jerome are they?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","767800","774800"," and they've got their own thoughts on what we're gonna do you've got some you got a couple of these guys we got one guy on the extreme"
"heGjOQMKsD4","774800","782800"," you got another guy saying I don't fucking believe him probably for the like ulterior motives he wants to see"
"heGjOQMKsD4","782800","792800"," growth to continue to the upside but you still have this this rate decision this last rate decision still is a thorn in my side"
"heGjOQMKsD4","792800","805800"," and you can see right now on these on these people that matter to the marketplace that they are arguing about what the fed is projecting"
"heGjOQMKsD4","805800","819800"," and funnily enough I read a USA Today article this morning and they tried to tone down in the article Jerome saying that he was going to hold and and raise for longer"
"heGjOQMKsD4","819800","829800"," into December of 2024 and they tried to downplay that today in this article from yesterday when they were trying to downplay that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","829800","840800"," that message that Jerome was telegraphing I urge all of you if you don't agree with my take on on the Jerome rate decision to go back and watch that video"
"heGjOQMKsD4","840800","852800"," and dissect it and watch it once twice or maybe even three times to get exactly what he was saying and my take on that rate increase was that the banks and people with money and rich people"
"heGjOQMKsD4","852800","861800"," and all these other fucking things regional banks are gonna throw a fucking hissy fit over what he did with those charts because it's bullshit"
"heGjOQMKsD4","861800","872800"," what he did that day was fucking bullshit and he had charts that were like 10 years up you know it's not his job to do that all he had to say was higher for longer"
"heGjOQMKsD4","872800","883800"," no rate increase higher for longer instead comes out and he starts to show you a bunch of goofy ass shit that has nothing to do with what actually is going to happen"
"heGjOQMKsD4","883800","891800"," and now you're seeing these talking heads come out and they're bewildered by that in my viewpoint they're bewildered by what he's saying"
"heGjOQMKsD4","891800","911800"," now if you are a bull you have something on your side that is that 10 year yield it's at 4.88 there should be some kind of an expectation of a roll or break of trend of that yield so we'll take a look at that right now"
"heGjOQMKsD4","911800","922800"," so I posted this chart on I believe Friday or Sunday or something like that posted this chart on the website"
"heGjOQMKsD4","922800","938800"," and this is where Bill Ackman and Mr. Fink expect us to go 5% so they say 5% what did we hit?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","938800","952800"," we hit 4.88 not quite 5 so if we do some kind of double top up here here's your squeeze by the way you do some kind of double top and then we send it lower you're looking for that if you're a bull"
"heGjOQMKsD4","952800","959800"," you can already see the yield popping down this should give you the ability to squeeze higher right right there"
"heGjOQMKsD4","959800","978800"," still see another low though in the market right squeeze higher roll down one more time and then there's your 5% yield that that rolls right you're going to get people that want to sell this right they're selling into it right now at 4.88 they're likely going to sell this as well"
"heGjOQMKsD4","978800","995800"," and the other thing I noticed this morning is I'm reading fucking I'm reading news stories saying I shit you not I'm reading news stories saying everybody's everybody's running to chase yield on the 10 year right now"
"heGjOQMKsD4","995800","1003800"," and I'm like as soon as that shit's out in the public that means they're going to sell into you so that's some hope for the bull as well"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1003800","1014800"," that you're going to get this pressure and break of trend so if you are a bull what are you looking for you're looking for that 10 year trend to break"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1014800","1024800"," so there's two things you're looking for here you're going to be looking for that 5% and you're going to be looking like you'll make some decent money on a squeeze here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1024800","1036800"," and here but the truth is you're looking for a break up here this is kind of this is what you're looking for is just a trend break of that 10 year yield"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1036800","1049800"," now there is something else that's very negative for you as a bull something that is actually dangerous for you as a bull and that is that HYG"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1049800","1052800"," now I want to show you something important here in HYG"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1052800","1067800"," HYG price broke above the monthly trigger and held it right here boom this is positive when HYG is above its monthly trigger"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1067800","1076800"," market is stable even if we have pullbacks going on up everything is honky-dory everything is great"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1076800","1086800"," we lost the monthly trigger on the second two days ago"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1086800","1096800"," I want to I want to mark this for you so that you know where the market became dangerous I want you to see where the market became dangerous"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1096800","1106800"," so on the second of October at 11 a.m. we rejected and broke below the monthly trigger here this is where the danger comes in"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1106800","1117800"," as long as we are below the monthly trigger the daily the weekly and the monthly is crossing here it can lend itself to a major crash believe it or not"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1117800","1126800"," in the stock market so let's say you see HYG come up and it gets a rejection in here and starts to bloodbath"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1126800","1142800"," these this trigger cluster right here can act as very violent for a downside move and risk on the equity market so I would if it was me"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1142800","1159800"," I would be paying close attention to cues and cues and S&P 500 if price on HYG comes back up to that 73.04 there's any rejection up here to the down side"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1159800","1181800"," if there's any rejection at 73.34 73.65 this is a big thing for bears and sellers as long as price on HYG remains remains below 73.65 73.04 we are in a stock market crash warning"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1181800","1200800"," that's where we are if there's rejection here and we continue to go lower you're going to get a crash so we need to monitor this HYG in the coming days"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1200800","1212800"," I'm still bullish if you want to know that we're going up and I got about 300 call spreads for December here now we're going to talk we're going to talk really quick about that trigger screen"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1212800","1224800"," we're going to talk really quick about that thread in the needle and rejection and what it means I'm going to show you some historical examples of what I'm discussing with you today"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1225800","1235800"," we're going to go to a one day chart on SPX I guess that's it doesn't matter if we go to spy or SPX for this we're going to go to a one day chart though"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1235800","1249800"," maybe it's I don't know if this is going to be easier for you to pay attention to but one of the key things here I want you to see is this"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1250800","1259800"," you can see already that this yellow line is making an attempt to cross below the weekly trigger"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1259800","1274800"," okay see this right this yellow line right here if it does cross the weekly trigger and we reject price we come up here to the weekly right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1275800","1295800"," and we get that cross and a rejection this result here is going to be bad and I ain't talking about going to like 406 or 4005 or anything like that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1296800","1308800"," the result of this the end result of this cross specifically here this yellow and orange cross leads to an unstable market and true volatility and likely a crash"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1308800","1319800"," so I want to show you some examples of this in the past of that cross happening and what happens and I also want to show you examples of this line getting very close"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1320800","1339800"," and the market threading the needle to escape the cross so the yellow comes down and price blasts up quickly consolidates and then starts to head higher gets underneath and we escape to the upside"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1339800","1354800"," and we're out of there so we don't have a lot of time left I think we've got five to eight sessions nine sessions four sessions for S&P and Q's to do it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1354800","1365800"," so I'm going to show you some examples really quick of us escaping and what happens when we do not you can see one of those right here actually just this year you can see one right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1365800","1376800"," down here where we didn't cross that that orange line we escaped above it and up up and away and we're out of there right I'm going to show you some historical examples here as well"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1376800","1392800"," here's one back here in 2021 and also 2022 right we slammed down into the weekly price didn't break the weekly but the yellow we recovered that yellow line before the yellow line cross right look what happened here though right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1392800","1408800"," so if you look right here you can see that we got the cross right you can see that price bounced we came back up and we failed the daily and the weekly"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1408800","1420800"," I'm going to warn you here that that was the moment that you were given a warning shot across the bow this cross here was your signal to get the fuck out of the market"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1420800","1434800"," you were even given more liquidity to the upside to exit the market but the key point here is you had the failure in the cross I want you to see that failure and the cross this was it right here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1434800","1442800"," that was your what that was that was your get the fuck out of the market right that was your get the fuck out of the market so if we're looking at this"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1442800","1453800"," where we are right now these two examples look at attention I'm gonna mute my my camera over here hold on so you can see everything"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1453800","1463800"," so if you look at this cross here right I want to use this as an example right there and then this as an example right there these are two easy examples"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1463800","1477800"," two easy examples to pay attention to and specifically where are we right now we are either going to be at that slip right out and we're out of here or we're gonna be like this example right here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1477800","1492800"," where we rip some faces off and we reject immediately to the downside right and that brings up a 403 64 and you might you may not though but you might get one more opportunity"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1492800","1507800"," opportunity to get out but the truth is that they might the market because the market starts to give itself up here now you might think hey cap you're looking at only two examples show us some more you got one right there and you got one right there cap on to show us some more"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1507800","1521800"," so I will and you can see him right here right no cross of the yellow and orange no cross of yellow and orange even this deep one right here yellow didn't even follow did it here yellow didn't follow for orange yellow didn't follow for orange"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1521800","1535800"," but what happened back here when you got the cross of yellow and orange what happened fucking bloodbath boom right see up to the downside"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1535800","1543800"," no cross of yellow and orange no cross of yellow and orange no cross of yellow and orange what do you have right here you got a cross of yellow and orange"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1544800","1560800"," when that happens what happens fucking crash bam to the downside bloodbath right there nasty vicious see you later that's 215 this was 280 that's a third of the market right there gone"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1560800","1571800"," you see what I'm saying here so we can look at further examples of this in the past as well there's the first cross right here here's the second cross right there bloodbath to the downside"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1571800","1592800"," this is 2016 no cross right here and any kind of blood here though we still had major blood in a screamer to the upside right that actually is that recovery squeeze right that recovery squeeze no cross right here big recovery"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1593800","1609800"," right cross right here what took place this is 2011 right this is actually a similar this is actually very similar to where we are in the market right now this 2011 is a very similar time period"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1609800","1624800"," in what's happening in our stock in our markets but look at that bloodbath straight down to the depths of hell right we're trading 10871 and we traded 86 90 so roughly 20 30% of the stock market"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1624800","1631800"," so if we go come back to where we are right now this actually works well for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1631800","1640800"," actually works well going back to 1896 so what does that mean for us right now is"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1640800","1655800"," this is spy right now right what can we pause it here we can pause it that you'll likely see a squeeze you're likely going to see a squeeze but it does matter what happens here doesn't it if there's a rejection"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1655800","1669800"," and we slam down into this 403 let's measure that and find out how much that is because we know that we go down 20 30 40 50%"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1669800","1679800"," let's take a the top here and go straight down to here that's only 11.2% that ain't shit"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1679800","1701800"," that ain't even 20% what's that right there that's 26% that's 20% and that's 332 71 where is the JPM caller for Q4 the bottom side I believe is 3500ish right somewhere in there"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1702800","1718800"," so the JPM caller is telling you for Q4 this is possible right so they've got a hedge uh oh they got some weirdness going on right now"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1719800","1732800"," so there is a possibility in Q4 that we can actually reject here cause market panic get underneath that 403 and start bloodbathing it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1732800","1745800"," right so you have your warning you have your warning right now for me right you haven't from other people but you have them from me saying to you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1745800","1752800"," that if at any point if there's a rejection above if you get a rejection above here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1752800","1778800"," hold on air right there if you get a rejection of either of these two numbers"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1778800","1803800"," to buckle the fuck up would be the best way I could say it so if either this right here or this right here anything like that and you likely not only see that 403 64"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1803800","1821800"," but you likely introduce a possibility of continued downside to that 350 mark into end of Q4 or Q1 of 2024 you actually create panic in the marketplace and it's all over so this is what we want to be paying attention to here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1821800","1838800"," in the coming days you don't want what you what you do want to see though is if you're or if you're a buyer at least because you don't want to see that do you don't want to see this cross of the yellow line below the orange right you don't want to see"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1838800","1848800"," a continuation down here right cross up above that orange line we reject into the downside what you need to be seeing is squeezing"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1848800","1867800"," small consolidation and start squeezing higher to the upside and reclaim so if you're a bull what are you looking for here 435 87 is what you're looking for 435 87"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1867800","1883800"," actually what you are what you are looking for 435 87 this is your like your last chance bull chance for for not only trend but let's be honest"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1883800","1897800"," I mean forget about giving up trend you're talking about you know not just breaking trend either but opening the door to a to a market crash to the downside"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1897800","1909800"," so in the background I will be watching that cross so every morning every night I look at that yellow line actually look at it every day and I go"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1909800","1921800"," is that thing still coming down and it is it's coming down it wasn't but it started to it started to turn to the downside and once it began it's downward descent I'm like oh shit this is bad"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1921800","1932800"," not confirmed yet but it's it's bad and so right now it's still coming down right now it's still dropping at a high vertical downward slope towards that weekly trigger"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1932800","1945800"," so if that cross happens and price reverses to the downside I'll post something on at captains alpha or trade the trigger or all three handles on Twitter and I'll say something in the discord and you'll have a video"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1945800","1959800"," if this happens in the overnight I'll come on live in the middle of the night if it's like 2 3 in the morning and that cross takes place 4 o'clock in the morning I don't care if that cross happens you will know about it from me"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1959800","1974800"," because that is a really bad it's like it it's a it's a it's a fundamental change to the market so I know you guys think we're it's bad right now but it's not if you want to see bad if you want to see a crash again"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1974800","1986800"," like it did in 2020 and like it did in 2022 we're setting up for it right now it's not confirmed yet but it's there it's looming in the background"
"heGjOQMKsD4","1986800","1999800"," but it's something that I think it's a really bad thing and I think it's a really bad thing."
"heGjOQMKsD4","1999800","2008800"," Well, it's someone's asking about jobs numbers and let's go back to that Jamie Diamond thing and that's a bill or a bill Ackman and"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2008800","2017560"," this up, I brought this up directly after, let's look at two other things, let's look"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2017560","2022840"," at the JPM caller. Well, on a second here, we got a bunch to look at takes haven't been"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2022840","2032840"," on right. So first thing we got to look at is this is the history of the JPM caller."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2032840","2038480"," And what I want to eat to you or for you to pay attention to is specifically this one"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2038480","2047040"," right here. This is Q2 of 2022. When this caller came out, we sold down below the middle"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2047040","2056040"," strike almost immediately. And then we actually blasted down and into below the lower strike"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2056040","2061000"," on that caller. Right? And it was almost was fast, right? Bam, bam, bam, get down here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2061000","2066400"," bam, bam, bam. We got a lot of work to do to the downside, right? And let's look at"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2066400","2074020"," the current caller here. So we're kind of at this place where, you know, if you don't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2074020","2080580"," save your own ass here, right? If you don't save your own ass down here, if we start to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2080580","2085880"," reject and sell in the beginning of this quarter, like we try this shit up here, right? We get"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2085880","2092380"," up to that weekly or that daily. And at any point we begin to reject, right? We start"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2092380","2104580"," ripping faces to the downside. We get below 4,000. Four zero five, four zero three on"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2104580","2112340"," the monthly trigger. It looks pretty fucking nasty, right? It starts opening the door to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2112340","2118220"," 3420 in the end of the quarter. That's how fast that happens. And you know what happens"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2118260","2124220"," if we blast down there, right? If you lose that confidence in the marketplace, if we"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2124220","2131340"," begin to reject, blast down below and do this kind of nonsense down here, right? And we"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2131340","2135540"," get into the end of that quarter and we're below 350. What do you think JPM is going to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2135540","2142140"," do? They're going to fucking lower this shit. They're going to do something like this, right?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2142140","2163580"," And then 2,800 becomes a question mark. Why 2,800? I'll show you that right now. You"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2163580","2169140"," got your four oh three right here, right? Four oh three 64. If in Q four, we get the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2169140","2175660"," major rejection, the bloodbath down below, we get underneath the Q four collar. What"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2175660","2182300"," are you looking for in Q one? Or excuse me, the end of Q two right down here. It's right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2182300","2189220"," 10. There's the purple three 32 71 on spoons. Let's make this SPX so we can look at that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2189220","2190020"," collar again."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2199140","2203980"," And what does it say here? Let's take a look at what this says, right? Let's say a close"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2203980","2210060"," look together as a team. What does that little purple thing say down there? It says three"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2210060","2217860"," four seven zero point eight seven three four seven eight point eight seven. Shocker, right?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2217860","2224160"," If you were making a collar, a bear seagull against the markets for Q four, where would"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2224160","2231680"," your lowest strike be right down there? So you got 34 70, right? That matches up magically"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2231680","2239860"," to the bear case, the rejection case below in that tag down there. And what about that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2239860","2249160"," 2800 number that I gave you? If you look down here, what do we have down here? We got 2814."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2249200","2258320"," So if I was JPM and we broke down to that 350, where would my Q one bottom target be 2814 likely"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2258320","2265520"," this will be about 21 or 28. Maybe this is 2900 by the time we get to them making that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2265520","2278840"," Q one projection to the downside. But that is on tap. What's below that? Right here 2059 2059"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2278840","2286920"," is next target to the downside. This is an extreme low right now 2095. That would likely"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2286920","2295040"," be about by the time we got here would likely be 2200 about 2200 by the time we got there."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2295040","2301960"," So the market is set up for this to happen, right? The market is currently set up for that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2301960","2311120"," to. And one second here to happen. The next thing we're going to look at here is cycles."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2313200","2316200"," We're going to take a look at cycles, then we're going to take a look at the unemployment"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2316200","2320480"," rates and all the other shit that you want to be asking questions about. So we're still"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2320480","2327080"," on trend here, right? Still on trend. I want you to pay attention to a couple of things"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2327080","2334280"," here. Whenever you ask me publicly, you say to me, Hey, cap, when do you place your bull"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2334280","2340400"," trades? When do you do your market breath indicator trades? And why aren't they frequent"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2340400","2349760"," and how many opportunities do you get? I tell you, you get somewhere between nine and 13"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2349760","2357280"," chances every year. Well, we don't have that, do we? We got one, two, three, and now we've"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2357280","2363880"," got four. So if you're a bull out there, and you're always looking for that perfect trade,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2363880","2370000"," and you're looking for that market breath trade, right? There's one right? There's one"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2370000","2376560"," right? There's one right? There's kind of a baby one, but right now we've got a big one."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2376560","2381720"," Right now, there's a big one. These are the moments where these are the moments where"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2381720","2389160"," they send out Dan Niles. These are the moments where they send out Dan Niles and Dan Niles"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2389160","2396760"," will say something to you like. We're extremely bearish. We think the market's going to crash,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2396760","2404440"," but we're going to buy the oversold bounce. So if you're a bull out there, this is actually"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2404440","2412160"," the time for you to put risk on. This is the moment that you put risk on. Now, you may"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2412160","2417640"," be like, what if it goes against me, Cap? You start to roll down. Right? That's why you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2417640","2422840"," have stops, right? You don't buy calls here, do you? You don't buy calls here, do you?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2422840","2429280"," You don't get that much. You get it down here when it's mostly bearish when people are bitching"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2429280","2435680"," and whining and crying and rich people, millionaires are all crying and you know, all the bulls"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2435680","2440000"," are on fucking, you've been to it and they're fucking whining about how they can't afford"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2440000","2447080"," shit and all this other shit. You got diarrhea being released, just pure fucking fear diarrhea."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2447080","2453440"," It's always when you're here, here, here and now right here. So this is the actual place"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2453440","2460000"," for you to put some risk on in the marketplace. Now, I'll give you something. If it does reject"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2460000","2466520"," and we start going down, you have some stops, but this is the place. It's not up here. You're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2466520","2473260"," not buying calls up here. You're not buying calls up here. Right? This is all when you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2473260","2477240"," time it, you like, Oh, I'm going to buy them up here, rolls back down on you. Now you're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2477240","2481800"," fucked up and you know, you're hoping and begging that we go up there, right? You didn't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2481800","2486080"," put enough time on your call spreads. So this is the time. This is the place that you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2486080","2490560"," put the risk on the marketplace. No matter what they're saying to you publicly, no matter"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2490560","2497520"," what you read on Fintuit, no matter what some asshole emails you and says that he's losing"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2497520","2502280"," millions of dollars on his storage units. No matter what CNBC tells you, Bloomberg tells"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2502280","2507120"," you, no matter what USA today tells you about how everybody's fucking fleeing. Say fucking"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2507120","2515200"," make money on 5% fucking yields. Or I can make 5% in a savings account. You literally"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2515200","2522080"," are waiting for these moments in the marketplace to risk money. And I've discussed this in"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2522080","2536160"," the past whenever we're whenever we have breath near capitulation phase. This is the moments"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2536160","2542480"," where I've expressed this to you in the past multiple times. I've said to people, you're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2542480","2546800"," not going to want to take these trades with me. You're not going to want to put this risk"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2546800","2553080"," on. You're not going to want to do this. I assure you when we are there, you're going"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2553080","2558440"," to not take the trade with me. The reason you're not going to take the trade with me is because"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2558440","2565400"," of the cacophony of bearishness in the marketplace. So we are at that moment right now."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2566400","2572320"," I know that if you're watching my show right now, that you feel this out there, you can't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2572320","2578160"," deny it. I know that you are. I know that you're feeling it. Just doom and gloom. I"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2578160","2583000"," know that if you're a bear or a seller, you are as excited and as as frothy as you can"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2583000","2590840"," be with a crash. Now for myself, I'm putting risk on right now. I'm looking at yesterday"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2590840","2595000"," and I'm like, yeah, this is we might go down a little bit more. We might go up and then"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2595000","2601960"," roll down and tag like for 13. But I have to pick my poison, right? Is it for 20? Is"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2601960","2609560"," it for 13? Do we not ever come back to tag the for 13? Do I put enough time on them one"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2609560","2618840"," month, two months or three months to get that payday? But this is most certainly not where"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2618840","2624440"," I don't put risk on. I mean, I'll day trade it. But this is not the place where I'm like,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2624440","2629560"," I'm buying the market here. I have posts on I don't know, I was bleating a bunch of"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2629560","2634720"," my Twitter shit, strangely, all my Twitter shit from day one. But I remember this morning"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2634720","2639720"," I had a video and I had a post. It was like six or seven in the morning. I had a post"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2639720","2645240"," on Fintuit. And I was like, everybody was screaming market crash that morning. I think"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2645240","2651560"," it was October 11 or 12. And I was like, buy the fuck out of this right now, buy it all."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2651640","2658600"," I was the laughing stock of Fintuit. And right now, I bet that on this date on March, March"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2658600","2666520"," 13th, you heard the same shit. And then back here, today, you're hearing the same fucking"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2666520","2671440"," diarrhea. No, can they be right? Now we're going to reject and roll down like, Hey, we're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2671440","2678560"," going to reject this. Sorry, bloodbath. Maybe they're right. But I'll have stops here. I'll"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2678560","2683560"," look for this rejection. I'll manage the trade. If we get the big role of the daily"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2683560","2688840"," trigger over the weekly trigger, I'll be watching for that to manage the risk that I'm putting"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2688840","2696880"," on the marketplace. But this is the fucking place. And if we do recover here, I'm going"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2696880","2701960"," to tell you the next part that happens. So if we recover here, if there is a recovery,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2701960","2707200"," and we begin to go up, I'm going to tell you exactly what fucking happens. Three quarters"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2707200","2713120"," of you are buying calls right there. And three quarters of you are the most bullish"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2713120","2719480"," that you could be. And a bunch of you bears are selling your shorts up there, rather than"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2719480","2728120"," getting short. Does it make sense to you? So this is the place to get bullish. This"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2728120","2734040"," is the place to get bearish. Get bearish, get bearish, get bearish, get bullish, get"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2734680","2740520"," bullish. Now, if we have a fundamental shift in the marketplace, we reject and we go down,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2740520","2745560"," fuck it. We're all bull or all bears at that point, right? We got a trend change until"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2745560","2750800"," this trend changes to the to the upside. We will trade that shit to the depths of hell."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2750800","2756280"," Does that make sense to you? So if we get a major trend change, we will take that trade"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2756720","2766880"," we will become bears bears. But until then, we ain't there yet. This is the place for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2766880","2775120"," you to get pretty fucking bullish, pretty fucking bullish. And you tactfully know that you can't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2775120","2781680"," trade below. You can probably trade for 13, but somewhere like on spy before 13. But"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2781680","2786840"," you can basically, you know, you can you can deal with 420 and you can deal with 413"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2786840","2789960"," as long as we bounce and keep going higher and the daily trigger doesn't reject us."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2789960","2794200"," And we're going to start going up. And in three months, you're going to look back and"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2794200","2799840"," you're going to say, I'm fucking rich. That's what you're going to say. And if we reject"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2799840","2805840"," and break down, you're going to lick your wounds, you're not going to take a heavy loss."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2805840","2810920"," And you're going to switch to bearish. And you're going to look for entry. The next"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2810920","2813840"," one that comes, right? You're going to be hell. Yeah, I'm selling this right here,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2813840","2822600"," Kathy, right? And you're selling that down and selling that down and selling that down."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2822600","2828040"," Now we're going to look at the we're going to look at two parts of the cycles. PMO is"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2828040","2835920"," not showing a reversal yet. So that's not bullish. That shows that we have to be cautious."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2835920","2842480"," There is a little bit of a turnaround though here in PMO or PPO, excuse me, PPO is turning"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2842480","2848280"," that dark purple. And it's it's telling you that there's a high chance of a major squeeze"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2848280","2853160"," to the upside hasn't happened yet. But it is showing you you're not getting light purple"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2853160","2857520"," bars down here. You're getting these dark ones and you're getting declining bars. See"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2857520","2864160"," the declining bars right here telling you expect to squeeze. Another thing for a bull"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2864160","2878760"," is that we're at 5.3% bullishness. We're at my or we're at 5.8% on the total bullishness"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2878760","2886560"," right here and right here. When we get this sold when we get become this oversold, we"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2886560","2894120"," always get a bounce even if we're in a crash. So even if we're in a crash, we still get"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2894120","2901880"," oversold bounces. We still get oversold squeezes. And this here is telling you to expect one."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2901880","2906280"," And if you don't think so, if you're like, Oh, no, cap, that doesn't happen. I don't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2906280","2912640"," know what you're talking about. Cappy. I'm going to firmly disagree with you. Firmly"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2912640","2918520"," and I'm going to show you where it's happened in the past. There's a big bad boy right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2918520","2927400"," here. Big giant bad boy right here and you can see oversold bounces right this 2020 giant"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2927400","2935240"," oversold bounce here. We'll see if we can look at this it up on a more pretty a fun time chart."
"heGjOQMKsD4","2935240","2941240"," Where are we out here?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2949520","2955760"," I got a slide back a whole shit ton to show these things. Well, it doesn't want to it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2955760","2967400"," doesn't want to come with me to the downside. Right here. Even in this crash here, we had"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2967400","2972440"," major squeezes like rip faces off squeezing, right? Here's another one right here. Big"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2972440","2977120"," giant squeeze right there and then the bottom right down there, right? Three giant squeezes"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2977120","2985160"," in spoons as we capitulated at one of the fastest paces in history, right? We still"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2985160","2995200"," had oversold bounces here. So you will have time is my point. If we do break to the downside,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2995200","2999920"," if you have if you think, Hey, Cap, we're still going to crash. I'm not buying this. You're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","2999920","3005000"," still going to have an opportunity on a trend change to the downside. If you have some kind"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3005000","3010600"," of a trend change here, you break down, you're still going to get the chance to be a seller"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3010600","3014120"," here. Does that make sense? You're still going to get that squeeze up, still going to be able"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3014120","3024400"," to sell this down, get down below that that 3500 to the downside. And this market breath"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3024400","3031400"," indicator is telling you expect a squeeze, expect a squeeze. PPOs are telling you expect"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3031400","3036880"," a squeeze. PMOs are telling you, yeah, even if we get that squeeze, there's no guarantee"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3036880","3043520"," of a reversal to the upside. So for right now, I'm going to go with we're squeezing in the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3043520","3052360"," next coming sessions. The next one today to the next three to five sessions or so, you're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3052360","3060520"," going to see a squeeze. We're now going to switch over to what was being asked. Oh, wait a minute."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3060760","3065520"," Oh, that's not the right one. Oh, that one's second here. We're going to talk about when"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3065520","3076920"," does when does everything matter? I think that's a weekly chart here. When does everything begin"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3076920","3094880"," to matter? This is SPX might be a little bit sloppy here. Let's take a look at SPX. So"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3094880","3107120"," here's SPX. What is a bear looking for? What is the one of the banks looking for, right? You"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3107120","3116520"," got the Fed chair saying, we ain't going to be at 6% unemployment. This is December of 2024."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3116520","3132600"," And that's showing 5.53% unemployment in December 2024. If you think we're at five or six five or"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3132600","3137720"," six percent unemployment in 2024 in December, he's talking about holding rates up at five percent,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3137720","3142200"," five and a half, maybe one or two rate increases. You got Jamie Diamond out there saying we're going"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3142200","3150200"," to seven basis points. You're telling me if we have unemployment at 6% in December of 2024,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3150920","3157240"," that Jerome's going to be at seven basis points in the markets going to be up. I'm going to tell"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3157240","3165160"," you, fuck, no, it isn't. So I think Jamie, Jamie Diamond, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie is lying to you. I think"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3165160","3170120"," Jamie Dimon is trying to say to you, we ain't going to get there. I think he's going to say to you,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3170120","3174200"," I'm trying to make some money here in the downside move. All I care about is that right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3174200","3178840"," now. I'm going to threaten you with seven, seven basis points. You got Mike Wilson probably in"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3178840","3185960"," a trade right now saying we're going to be stuck in that hell, right? Give me 4,000. He's probably"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3185960","3192440"," in a short right now for 4,000. Then you got Bill Ackman out there and Bill Ackman's looking at"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3192440","3196600"," this stuff more than likely looking at this stuff saying there ain't no fucking way we're going"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3196600","3200680"," up there. There ain't no fucking way we're going to have 6% unemployment. There ain't no way"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3200680","3204600"," that we're going to have rates just rip and face off. There ain't no way that we're going to have"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3206760","3211160"," inflation coming down and we're going to start to roll. Now, if we get that roll,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3211160","3216840"," right, that that rates roll and you get the inflation still coming down and you get unemployment"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3216840","3223640"," coming up and you get rates coming up. This is the trifecta for the market roll or the quadruple"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3223640","3231000"," effecta, quad effecta for the market roll. So now what it really means is a matter of timing."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3231960","3238840"," Does it happen now? Do we start bloodbath and rejecting up here, right, and start making that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3238840","3244440"," roll down until he's forced to cut rates or is it a little bit farther out in time? That's what"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3244440","3248360"," Mike Wilson is saying, right? Let me farther out in time before we actually make that roll to the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3248360","3253560"," downside or is it Bill Ackman saying we're never going to get there. Let's go back to that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3253720","3256760"," crash in the springtime in the summer of 2024."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3258520","3264360"," So no one's really believing none of these guys are actually believing that we make it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3267160","3274040"," into December 2024, except for maybe diamonds saying seven or seven basis points on rates,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3274040","3278120"," but we already know they're probably lying, right? We already know that you're unemployment at 7%,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3278920","3284120"," 6%, you're telling me they're going to be adding rates at 6% or 7% unemployment,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3284120","3289800"," you're out of your fucking skull. If you have seven basis points and inflation is bottoming"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3289800","3295560"," out at 2%, you're out of your fucking skull if you think we're going any higher. So from my"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3295560","3302360"," perspective, I think that the Fed is being called out. I think that I think the Fed is being told"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3302360","3311560"," by these big talking heads. We don't believe that you're going there or diamond saying"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3312200","3317480"," seven basis points is maybe he's just saying, well, fuck it. Let's do it. If you're going to go to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3317480","3323000"," fucking holding rates up in December 2020, fuck it. Let's make it seven right now. Let's make it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3323000","3331320"," seven by spring or summer. Let's really put the fucking hurt on this market. So maybe he's got"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3331320","3337720"," some joy in that. I can get behind that. I can get behind Jamie saying seven basis points. Do I"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3337720","3345000"," think you get seven basis points in December of 2020, 2024? Fuck no. Do I think if we went to seven"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3345000","3351720"," basis points in the spring that the market's going to react well to that? Fuck no. Going to roll"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3351720","3357720"," this shit to the depths of hell. Absolutely. Do I think that the consumers hurt yet? Fuck no."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3358680","3362760"," But do I think that they'll raise and hold until they do really get the pain where they start"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3362760","3367400"," losing their homes where they start to lose their wives or kids or dogs? Yes. Do I think it's right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3367400","3372840"," now? No. What did Jerome have to say? Hire for longer? That's all he had to say. That's all he had to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3372840","3378360"," say. And we in the funny part is if he had just said that he could have went to seven basis points"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3379000","3383880"," and opens the door to that right now. He's like, we're going to we're going to raise a 0.25 or 25"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3384360","3389720"," again possible and hold in December of 2024. And I'm like, nothing in the data is suggesting that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3389720","3394600"," you're going to be doing that in December of 2024. The data is suggesting that you're going to get"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3394600","3399400"," control of inflation and you're going to get, um, you're going to get unemployment and jobs"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3399400","3405240"," going away between now December 2024. And these talking heads are saying the same shit basically."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3405240","3410360"," We don't believe you. And furthermore, uh, I'm going to, I'm Jimmy Diamond. I'm going to call"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3410360","3413400"," you out on it and say, fuck it. Let's go to seven then. Let's make it happen."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3418040","3420200"," Let's get this a minute to load up. There we go."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3423000","3425400"," So you guys have this up on the screen for you right here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3431080","3433560"," Do you guys want to see that that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3433560","3435560"," you guys like that Webull chart? You guys want to see it?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3441240","3447400"," I posted this chart for you on posted this chart for you on, um,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3451000","3455400"," I want to say it there. I posted this chart for you on the website. Uh, you can see the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3455400","3461240"," rejection here, rejection here to the downside, right? Slamming down. Sellers want to get underneath"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3461240","3465560"," this hourly trigger to the downside and trade and close. There's a couple gaps down below here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3465560","3469320"," that need clothes on SBX, a couple of hidden gaps. We can take a look at that if you want to,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3469320","3472520"," if you want to see those gaps. Let me show them to you here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3472520","3489480"," Just so you can see price right here. There's a little gap right."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3491000","3493240"," There's the first one right there. We closed that one."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3493720","3506280"," That gap has been closed and there's a secret one down here. There's a, not a secret, but there is one"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3507320","3509160"," right down here. There's one."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3515000","3520280"," That's a 413 and 41465 and there's a secret secret one down here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3521240","3526840"," This one, this little tiny one, that little gap down there is at 4085 on SBX."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3528680","3532600"," So if you're wondering why or how we get there,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3537800","3540920"," if you're wondering how do we get down there, there's the five minute chart again"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3542280","3544040"," for why we would go down there."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3544360","3550840"," It's right down there. There's 409. There's S3 for you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3552120","3553880"," S2 right up here, S1."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3557000","3560520"," And that would be that rejection, standing underneath the hourly trigger and start heading"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3560520","3568520"," to the downside, right? On the upside, if you are a bear, you are looking for the rejection"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3568520","3572840"," right here. As long as price is above the hourly trigger, you're going to be looking for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3572920","3577560"," the rejection on the weekly trigger and also on that daily trigger,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3579640","3585320"," big rejection on any kind of squeeze to the upside. Currently, price is sitting above"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3586680","3590520"," or was sitting above the hourly trigger. Let me just check it real quick and make sure that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3590520","3600440"," we're still above it. Yeah, it's parked right on it right now. So this is accurate right here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3601400","3605800"," So price is parked on the hourly trigger and the pivot, hold on here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3611480","3614040"," You can see it right here. If I go to the one minute chart,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3619480","3625880"," just so you can see it here, try to smash it down into that hourly trigger. You can see it right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3625960","3633880"," there. There's the H. Your 30 minute trigger is at 42246 down here. 44236 to the downside."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3635000","3638600"," Still no cross of the one and five minute here. So still bullish."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3640760","3647960"," We'll see if this can hold here. See you on there. Now, if you're having trouble,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3647960","3656520"," if you're having trouble accessing the tool, we're going to go over that and stream how to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3656520","3663480"," access it. So you shouldn't, but well, I'll tell you this. If you're familiar,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3665480","3673800"," there you go. If you're familiar with trading view, you go to the indicators button in the top"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3673800","3679800"," middle, say indicators on it, you click on it and a new tab will pop up that says invite only"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3679800","3686440"," scripts. You're going to get access to three scripts to velocity and triggers. You'll get"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3686440","3690840"," two trigger scripts, one with channels and one without. So if you don't like channels,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3690840","3695720"," that's the one that you use. If you use, if you can even hide and unhide with and without"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3695720","3699240"," channels, so you could put all three indicators up. I also want you to know that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3699240","3703160"," you're pairing some of these gains here. Still up zero spot, 4% on the session alongside"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3703160","3706040"," that some strength in the dollar. It's still down zero spot, 3% though."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3709160","3712840"," And so again, then use catalyst for this particular move. They're just keeping your eyes on the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3712840","3719560"," wires here. If so, if you're familiar, it's easy. You just go to the indicator button,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3719560","3724520"," you click on it, you go down, you'll see the invite only scripts. You hit all three and then you can,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3725480","3733320"," use a, it's like an, it's like an eye button that's on the, the tools and you can just click them to,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3734360","3740440"," to leave the triggers up, but hide the channels. So you're going to get access to all three to start."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3742920","3750360"," If you're, if you have, there's a couple caveats here. So if you have a free account,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3750360","3755720"," I want you to know that your data will be delayed. If you have a paid account and do not pay for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3755720","3763880"," data, you still get real time data, except for a couple tickers, but it's not complete data. It's"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3763880","3769960"," only pulling from, I think the C, the CBO or something like that. So, but you can then buy data if you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3769960","3773720"," like, but there's no requirement that you buy data is my point. If you use a free account,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3774520","3779560"," you have a limitation on how many indicators you can use. So I think it's two, two or three."
"heGjOQMKsD4","3779560","3784520"," So this will fit the bill for you to have a free account and use the tools, although you'll"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3784520","3788680"," have delayed data. If you're looking for a discount, like a cap, I don't want to pay"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3789320","3793560"," seven bucks a month or eight bucks a month to trading view, you can always stay with the delayed"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3793560","3799480"," data. You just can't day trade with it. If you, if you want to get real time data, I would not"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3799480","3806680"," personally buy real time data as a package. I would just pay for, pay for the trading views,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3806680","3810920"," whatever training view package you like. And then on top of that, I would say to you that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3810920","3816920"," you can usually get that, that signing up for a year. You can usually get a discount of about"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3816920","3824360"," 50 to 60%. So if you don't have that code, I'll try to post that in the stream today at some point,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3824360","3830360"," a code for you to get a discount of 40 to 60%. I've got, I've got an affiliate code,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3830360","3834920"," but it doesn't matter. I don't use it on this dev account. So don't try to make any money off"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3834920","3840360"," you. I'm not going to try to like give you a discount code that gives me any money. So I want"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3840360","3844840"," you to first realize that whatever code I give to you is I'm not making any money off. It's zero"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3844840","3851880"," fucking dollars. So I'll get that to you here in just a few moments. So and I'm still in putting"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3851880","3857000"," names. If you're new to trading view, you don't have any experience in your moderator on YouTube"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3857000","3863960"," and Twitch, hang tight. I'll get you access. Sign up for a free trading view account. Don't pay"

"heGjOQMKsD4","3991080","3994200"," Now let's just drop the hammer on that. At this point, I think we figured out they're two weeks"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3994200","3998280"," old, but then on the mom, the mom actually, I brought them a blanket and left them outside for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","3998280","4004120"," a full day. In case the mom came back, she never came back. So she never came back 24"

"heGjOQMKsD4","4634040","4635400"," We actually got a few things to go over, but"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4637560","4639320"," time is this 1.56 in the afternoon."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4641720","4645400"," I'm going to give you a brief overview. Okay, and we'll chat about it."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4645400","4646920"," So we're going to go to the trigger screen right here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4648280","4652680"," And indicators. We're going to go to invite only scripts."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4654360","4658680"," So I want you to see the scripts right here. This should pop up for you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4659560","4664040"," Oh, all right. I guess that didn't do it. Did it. So up here in the top left hand side,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4664040","4666600"," you can't see it on my screen here, but let me see if I can bring this down."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4668040","4671480"," So on my screener, I want you to see this button right here where it says indicators."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4671480","4676520"," You're going to click on that. Okay. So indicators. If you click on indicators,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4676520","4681800"," it should say invite only scripts. You should see from cool algos. You should see"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4683080","4687480"," one, two or three right now. I'm only I'm only using the triggers with channels"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4687560","4692520"," and I'm using velocity. Okay. You click on these, click on that, click on that,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4692520","4696760"," and click on the yellow. It's not yellow, like see how it's not yellow, the star,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4696760","4700520"," now it is. That'll make it put it in. It'll also put that in your favorites."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4701400","4702920"," So that you always have access to it."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4705560","4708040"," So you click them once, click, click, click each one once,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4708040","4712360"," and then I'll don't forget to highlight to add it to your favorite indicators."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4713320","4715240"," And it should pop up on your screen."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4716280","4718600"," Now we're going to talk about the indicator on your screen here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4720040","4724760"," When you cycle, when you cycle on different timeframes,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4725480","4729880"," you're going to get an auto calibration for those timeframes."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4730840","4736280"," So if you're a day trader and you're trading the one minute chart on trading view,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4737240","4743160"," you're going to get a certain set of triggers and velocity."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4744440","4750440"," If you switch to a 30 minute chart, 30 minutes, you're then going to get a separate package"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4750440","4757160"," of triggers and velocity. If you then switch to a daily chart, you're going to get a completely"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4757160","4762040"," different set of triggers and velocity. So I'm going to be aware of that one minute,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4762200","4769000"," 30 minutes, and daily. So if I cycle through here on the top left hand side, if I cycle through,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4770360","4774520"," me mute my thing over here, my camera and my web frame."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4775880","4780680"," So if I come up to, not indicators, look up to the time frame, and I pick 30 minutes,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4781960","4786040"," you will notice that I get different velocity and different lines."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4786840","4793640"," If I switch to a one day chart, I'm going to get different velocity and different lines as well."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4795160","4801400"," And personally, I like to use the one, the daily trigger, I like to, or the daily trigger package,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4801400","4808440"," I like to use for macro analysis. So where are we on a much higher time frame"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4809240","4812520"," than trying to buy calls or puts for one to three months?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4813320","4821160"," So I'm basically looking for, so right now specifically on this daily, I'm looking for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4821160","4827160"," that cross there, because the target is this downside here, right? Target is 40364."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4828440","4833560"," And then I'm looking for these time frames, or these time frames down below this 322 down here,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4834120","4841000"," and this 281 down here, the velocity package that's here, what matters about it is I want"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4841160","4845480"," you to like fuck around with this on your own, and I want you to see"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4847720","4854040"," how we have moments of accumulation on daily, weekly, and monthly velocity. And once we get to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4854040","4859480"," plus 50, we start to sell off of it. Same thing happened on weekly here, we sold off of it,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4860360","4865720"," right? You can actually see the continuation to the downside here. But the ones that matter"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4865720","4872360"," the most is usually the light blue, the orange, and the yellow. As a matter of fact, if you look"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4872360","4879880"," back here in 2022, you can see we were maxed out on quarterly velocity at yearly velocity,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4879880","4885640"," weekly velocity. So right in here, we were maxed out, and it was foretelling that the market was"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4885640","4891880"," about to top and roll over before it happened here. Okay, we don't actually see that right now,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4891880","4899560"," do it. Don't actually see the topping here. Well, we just see the topping here in weekly."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4900120","4906600"," We're starting to see the monthly and quarterly heading into negative territory right now,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4906600","4912280"," right? So that's kind of bearish, not bullish. And your weekly combined with that is not looking"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4912280","4921800"," good either, right? This is kind of foretelling. See how we break below over here. Came back"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4921880","4928120"," up over here. And we're now coming back down, right? We break negative here. It's likely"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4928120","4939960"," foretelling a move to the downside over here. Now in the 30 minute chart. I'm using daily velocity,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4939960","4948200"," hourly velocity, that's the green 30 minute and 15 minute velocity. I'm not using anything,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4948840","4954600"," the one minute, the five minute, not using that velocity down here at all. Am I? I'm just using"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4954600","4960360"," this higher timeframe velocity. What is this velocity saying to us right now? On a 30 minute"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4960360","4966840"," chart, it's saying that this should hold. Right? We're at the bottom, we're at the bottom here,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4966840","4972520"," we're at the bottom here. We got some higher lows going on. We got this deep bottom over here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","4972520","4977800"," We're kind of bottoming out on daily velocity. So even though we are weak right now, right?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4978600","4983320"," It's telling you like we're not that weak, even though we're weak, we're looking for a bloodbath"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4983320","4989320"," more than likely not, right? Likely not looking at a bloodbath, looking like any kind of weakness"
"heGjOQMKsD4","4989320","4999400"," will hold and will actually go up here. So right now, if you're watching spoons on a 30 minute basis,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5000280","5005640"," intraday basis, it's looking like, well, the daily trigger is saying we could go down a little"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5005720","5010600"," bit more, but we're getting really long in the tooth on being bearish is what it's saying."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5013080","5018200"," So if I go to this weebull chart, and how bearish does this look, this pretty fucking bearish,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5018200","5023400"," right? This doesn't look good. We're underneath the hourly trigger. We never like seeing that."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5023400","5029480"," We have a cross coming up right now on the one in five minute here. We've got a three trigger"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5029480","5035560"," bear cluster, right? Three trigger bear cluster. And the daily trigger is saying, hey, we can have"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5035560","5041880"," some more down to go, but is it going to be a crash? Probably not. So any kind of weakness"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5041880","5049160"," heading into this close on a 30 minute basis, I'm going to expect for there to be a bottom to buy."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5050040","5055960"," Makes sense. It's not like crash, crash, crash. It's just saying this weakness should be temporary"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5055960","5062760"," and not crazy. So right now, if we had this setup, we had this setup."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5067480","5073320"," And velocity was on the upside. If we were way up here and way up here and way up here and way"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5073320","5081960"," up here, I would say to you that expect a bloodbath here to the downside, I would say expect a"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5081960","5087240"," bloodbath. And if you want an example of that, I'll give you one right now. So you can see it as"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5087240","5094680"," we came into as we came into the topping pattern in the market, you can actually see the daily"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5094680","5101320"," velocity starting to go lower, even though price is not showing it, but it's anticipating a topping"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5101320","5106440"," pattern that's going to roll the market down, right? But we're just starting to bottom down here,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5106440","5113800"," right? You see that? That just starting to bottom down here. So what kind of weakness would I expect"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5113800","5121000"," in price for all of this bearishness over here? And my answer is going to be not that much,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5122120","5127720"," not like I would have expected if we were topping in the marketplace. And the daily trigger has had"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5127720","5134360"," some time to get down there, right? You can actually see on a daily basis that the daily trigger has"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5134360","5140120"," been been lagging down here, right? But even though it's down here, it's the time to start thinking"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5140120","5144680"," about buying a dip. You know what I'm saying? The time to start thinking about buying a dip,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5144680","5153400"," what's your poison? What's your price? Is it 420? Is it 413? Is it 416? Whatever that is,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5154280","5160600"," this is saying to buy a dip currently on a one minute basis, if I switch over to this one,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5160680","5165640"," what am I looking at for on this one minute chart? So I've only got the hourly. I don't have daily"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5165640","5170840"," any longer. I've got half hour five and one minute. Also want to point out that the 15 minute and half"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5170840","5178040"," hour are not to be trusted. But I do use them as a I do assign the half hour trigger"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5179880","5184920"," importance based on the hourly and not the one minute trigger. So there's a one minute time frame"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5184920","5191560"," right here. And what do I want to see to get bullish again? I see the cross above right now,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5191560","5197320"," do you see that cross? This is bearish. So you can't get bullish right now, right? I need to see"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5197320","5205960"," price get back above, right? And the cross to take place. And this to turn to long, this key over"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5205960","5211080"," here will tell you if you're bullish or bearish. So what I'm going to ask you to do if you're"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5211080","5218600"," going to beta test this is I want you to what I want you to do is I want you to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5221080","5227000"," just look at it for two or three days. Don't trade it. Don't use it. Especially if you're a"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5227000","5231800"," futures trader if you're a futures trader, if you trade futures, this tool is fucking phenomenal."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5232680","5237000"," But what I want you to do is just keep it on the background, watch the market with it."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5237000","5242680"," Don't trade real money with it. And I want you to tell me what you are taking away."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5243800","5247240"," Like, what does it mean to you? Like, is this telling you that we're going to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5248200","5252280"," that support level will hold that a resistance level will be broken through?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5253080","5261560"," Will the support level break? Or will the or will we reject on resistance? So like, those are"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5261640","5268280"," some big things, right? Is it bouncing on those levels on those triggers? Are we rejecting on those"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5268280","5273720"," triggers? Does the velocity give you an any kind of insight, whether it's going to hold or not?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5275160","5280040"," Does the does the box on the right hand side tell you anything when we're max bearish on"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5280040","5286040"," multi timeframe velocity? Are we are we holding or not? Right. So I want you to report back to me"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5286040","5294200"," what your takeaways are not knowing anything or having any access to a white paper or training,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5294760","5299800"," video training. So I want you to just hang out with this, use this tool for like two, three days."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5301000","5304600"," And matter of fact, you don't even have to do it in real time. You can just look at your favorite"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5304600","5309720"," tickers. If your favorite ticker is USO, if your favorite ticker is GME, if your favorite tickers"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5309720","5317560"," Tesla, look at your different timeframes on your ticker and tell me via email, I'm going to give"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5317560","5324200"," you an email address. And I want you to tell me what your takeaways are in just those three days."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5324840","5333320"," Now, what we're going to do is, uh, what they say today's Wednesday, right? On Friday's broadcast,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5333320","5338760"," Friday's live stream. I'm going to do a training live stream with you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5339800","5346920"," So I'm going to go through how to use the tool on Friday. All it probably take us all day long,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5346920","5350440"," though we'll watch the market at the same time. But I'm going to go, I'm going to do a training"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5350440","5357000"," session live with you on Friday. I think he's going to record it. And we'll package it up into"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5357000","5362920"," little like videos, like 10 minute segments. If you can't be there on Friday, it'll be posted to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5362920","5367880"," the YouTube channel and you'll be, you'll have access to that training video and it'll tell you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5368440","5372040"," this means this and that means that and this means this and that means that."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5374200","5378520"," So, so you should have no issues after Friday. So you can have it show up on Friday to that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5378520","5384920"," training class so we can go through the tool or you can watch it later in the future. But for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5384920","5390520"," just right now, just want you to just work on like, just use the tool, fuck around on the internet,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5390520","5397800"," use it on VIX, use it on HYG, use it on ES or NQ or oil and gas, use it wherever you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5397880","5405400"," like and see what you can, what your takeaway is from this tool. If you're a day trader,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5406280","5411240"," how about you just trade your day away and keep the tool open on a second screener and just see"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5411240","5416600"," what the tool is telling you versus what you're doing. And it is there, can I better it for you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5416600","5423560"," to make it better? Or was it telling you something and it didn't work? Because I think it does,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5423560","5426920"," but I want to hear your take on it because if it doesn't, I want to make sure that it's"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5426920","5429000"," absolutely fucking perfect for you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5435480","5439160"," Yeah, we're going to talk about something right now for you. So just right away,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5440200","5443640"," so if you've got the triggers up right now, Jill just said, why are my numbers so different"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5443640","5446440"," than yours? We're going to talk about that really quick. So,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5450120","5456280"," on the top right hand side of your screen, the first thing you want to do is click on the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5456280","5462840"," cogwheel. You can't see it here, but see this cogwheel right here? You see that cogwheel"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5462840","5469880"," where my cursor is? It says chart settings. If you click on that, it's going to bring up a chart"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5469880","5475720"," settings menu. Okay, and I want you to, first thing you do is I want you to click on session,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5477240","5484520"," symbol, and then session. And I want you to change from regular trading hours to extended"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5486280","5493000"," trading hours, extended trading hours, and tell me if that helps at all."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5503080","5505400"," Jill, let me know in the chat if that helps you or not."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5510120","5513800"," But on Friday, we're going to go through, and I'm going to show you my settings. On Friday,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5513880","5518760"," I'm going to go from top to bottom. So, if you have a new trading view account or even an old one,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5518760","5523800"," on Friday morning, I'm going to go through all the settings that I have, how I set mine up,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5524520","5528040"," so that you can be the same as me, or if you're like, fuck you, Cap, I don't want to be the same as you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5529000","5530760"," You can, you can not be the same as me."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5536520","5537400"," You're welcome, Jill."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5537400","5543240"," So, yeah, yeah, so we're going to go through, we're going to go through how I set mine up"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5543240","5546600"," with you on Friday. And if you don't have trading view, and you just got the access,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5546600","5551720"," or if you just like, just got your new trading view accounts, we're going to go through it from"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5551720","5557240"," step one all the way through the white paper. So, we're going to go through the entire training"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5557240","5566760"," course on Friday for how to use it, how to interpret it. And you should be baller from that point"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5566760","5571880"," forward, if you're a moderator or an administrator, you should have like the cats, you should you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5571880","5581640"," should like be fucking ready to rock with that tool. So, so the past couple days, we're forcing our"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5581640","5589880"," kids to feed, burp, and pee and poop to make the cats do that stuff. And we'll wake up with them"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5589880","5594520"," and do it with them, but we're having the kids responsible for this. And the one thing I saw"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5594520","5597400"," my wife last night about was, I was like, do you remember when you were a kid, I'm like, when I was"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5597400","5603960"," a kid, they gave us, I think it was in fifth or sixth grade, they gave us an egg. And they were like,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5603960","5608120"," they're like, you have to have the egg for a week, and you can't break it. And of course,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5608120","5612760"," as a kid, I was like, I'm not gonna break that egg. And then I just focused on it for a week."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5612760","5617240"," And of course, I broke the egg. And like, people were like making names for the egg, and they were"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5617240","5621720"," dressing the egg up, and it was paying the ass to take care of it. And it was a real pain in the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5622040","5626040"," ass. So now I'm like, fuck this, these kids think these cats are theirs. I'm gonna make these cats"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5626040","5629880"," make these kids feed these feed these kitty cat babies every three hours. It's like every three"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5629880","5635480"," hours 24 hours a day, you got to feed the kitties. So Joe Donut is saying we are beta testing to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5635480","5640520"," reiterate. We are beta testing our product with an elect select few like under 10 users to validate"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5640520","5644360"," our product for lunch. It's not a free product. And the beta testers will be providing us with"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5644360","5650680"," regular feedback during the test. So I'm going to give you guys, now I'm going to, on that same line"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5650680","5655000"," of thinking that Joe is doing right now, I'm gonna actually show you guys something."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5655800","5664040"," And I think it was posted, I think it was posted in the discord, but I'm gonna read it to you. Okay."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5665960","5669800"," I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna read something. I'm gonna read something for you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5671080","5673960"," Let me see what I sent here and read something to you specifically."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5673960","5681720"," Who did I send this to? I think, I think John L posted this or was going to post this in the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5681720","5686760"," discord, but I'm gonna read it to all of you just to make sure that you that we're clear here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5688920","5691960"," Here's, I thought I sent this to hold on a second here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5696520","5701800"," Oh, we're getting the just heads up out there. If you have, if you're cheating on your wife"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5702360","5708760"," or your husband, hide your phone, hide your burner phone because it's probably going off"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5708760","5713800"," right now. So if you're cheating on your wife, right, and you left the burner phone at home,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5714360","5719640"," it's probably going off right now. The US is performing an emergency broadcast system test"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5719640","5722120"," currently. So you're probably busted."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5722120","5736600"," Is your beeper, your beeper, your drug beeper is going wild. I'm going to text you 7 0 0 5 3"

"heGjOQMKsD4","5773960","5776680"," I'm a believer that this is the place for you to buy."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5777560","5786120"," Like 420 416 either of those works. You buy those numbers, but not financial advice,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5786120","5792520"," but that is the place to buy without without saying financial advice saying that you must"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5792520","5798200"," manage that trade because there is some fucking doom coming down from above. And whenever price"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5798200","5803560"," squeezes up to that daily trigger, you're going to be, you know, there could be some rejection"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5803640","5806680"," there, but you're going to be, you want to see price break above that daily trigger."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5808840","5814440"," And if you're not going to buy here, we're going to talk about this too. We have to talk about this."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5816360","5824840"," So if you're not going to buy here and you're like, cap, I really like buying the market breath"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5824840","5832040"," indicator, but I don't want to place the wrong trade. I will show you something that you do need."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5833000","5840920"," You can take a screenshot of this. Okay. If you want to buy the market breath over,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5840920","5849720"," oversold indicator and you want proof first, I respect that. So what you're looking for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5850600","5857560"," is you're looking for price to first squeeze here fail right there."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5858200","5862200"," Come back down to the daily trigger."
"heGjOQMKsD4","5866200","5873560"," And then begin to trade higher. Okay. So if you're looking for that moment to buy the market"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5873560","5880600"," and you're like cap too risky right now, I can understand that. So you're looking for price to come"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5880920","5887080"," so you're looking for price to come up, come back down to the daily trigger and be swooped up to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5887080","5893080"," the upside, right? So the daily trigger goes up there and price starts trucking along, right?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5893800","5898040"," We start, we already took this one out, we take that one out, we take this one out,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5898040","5900680"," and then we're heading for that one up there into end of quarter. So,"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5902680","5908840"," so the simple answer here would be the simplest answer would be you're waiting for price to get"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5908840","5917640"," above four thirty five eighty seven and retest it. Like you want to see that failure right there"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5917640","5923240"," and you want to see it hold. You want to see the hourly trigger come up from underneath and the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5923240","5928680"," hourly trigger help price go higher. So that would be my only last caveat that I should have mentioned"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5928680","5933480"," would be I should have mentioned would be you'd see the hourly trigger"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5934440","5939320"," here, it would be down here somewhere, right? You'd see the hourly trigger come up here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5940040","5949960"," and help the daily trigger out and this would be price right here. So if you're like cap I want"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5949960","5955640"," to wait until this happens to take along. I understand waiting for that. I understand why"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5955640","5961640"," you wait for that because I know what happens if that doesn't happen. What happens when that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5961720","5967080"," doesn't happen? We fucking we're going to sell to the depths of hell. We're going to sell off that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5967080","5972680"," daily trigger, right? We will wind up rejecting this daily trigger the daily trigger across the"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5972680","5976680"," weekly and we will start heading to the depths of hell. So you can either take the trade right"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5976680","5983480"," now and just manage it or you wait until it blasts above comes back down and holds above the daily"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5983480","5993960"," and the weekly. Oh dude, look at that. Nice. Look at that. Nice. Beautiful. Look at that. Nice"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5993960","5999400"," beautiful fucking bear fly or a bull flag right there. Look at that. Nice little bull flag just"
"heGjOQMKsD4","5999400","6007480"," trying to get above trying to squeeze up there into tomorrow trying to trade that for 26 or"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6008440","6013400"," 425 91. It's just begging to go up there. Look at it. Just begging to go up there right now."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6017400","6025800"," Yeah. Yeah. I bought call spreads yesterday. We were at like 420 in some change. I got a"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6025800","6031240"," purple line where I bought it. So down ran this purple line down here for 1999."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6032120","6039560"," For for 1999. I think I started talking about it yesterday. I started talking about buying it."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6040760","6046040"," And by the time I bought it was like took me like a half a fucking hour to set the trade up and then"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6047400","6051720"," then I posted it on fen to it. So it took me some time like where I wanted. I wanted to buy"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6051720","6055880"," I think for 18 tennis. I think we hit for 18 at one point and I was like I want to buy a fucking"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6055960","6062200"," call spread here. I'm like for 18 and for 14 16. It's not going to matter in three months. Like"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6062200","6068680"," let's be truthful here. Let's be honest. Let's be honest. If I buy for 18 or for 16 or for 14"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6069480","6075560"," and my and my conviction is we're going up. It ain't going to matter. Those that couple dollars"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6075560","6080840"," isn't going to make a difference on a spread. It's not going to make a difference. It's like hand"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6080840","6086840"," grenades and horseshoes. If I was buying calls it would matter. They will reprice some like"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6086840","6096520"," individual calls. They will reprice for that eventual squeeze. So yesterday I took I was like"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6096520","6100600"," fuck it. I want to capture all that data like burning all that data like I waited another day"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6100600","6106120"," or three days. If anyone bought calls two three days ago you're fucking styling right now because"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6106520","6111960"," you're scorching data as well. Like as long as you keep killing that data keep knocking days off"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6111960","6117560"," calendar and we're heading higher and we're not going any lower. Those calls are being good shape."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6121320","6124600"," Yeah. It looks like a stop on doesn't it? I'm still bullish here to the upside."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6128600","6131400"," So I'm going to read to you guys. I'm going to try to read to you."

"heGjOQMKsD4","6435400","6438440"," mini head and shoulders here doesn't it mini inverted head and shoulders doesn't look at a"

"heGjOQMKsD4","6449400","6451080"," Do the sneaky peat up into the clothes."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6459640","6466200"," Yeah John L is a fucking beast man he is a beast genius. Genius trader he's up there with David"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6466200","6471000"," AMS. Probably my two favorite traders on our discord right now if I had like two top traders"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6471080","6476360"," there probably David AMS and John L but if I had to pick they like forced me into picking."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6488600","6489880"," You guys want to see something cool?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6501560","6507800"," Price action is all about rates. It matters right now rates do matter right now but they"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6507800","6512680"," don't always matter. I think there's always a caveat they matter and they don't sometimes they"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6512680","6517080"," do sometimes they don't but they do matter right now. I will give you that for sure rates are"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6517080","6518120"," are concerned right now."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6526680","6527560"," One quick second here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6531000","6538120"," Let's see if I can get any insight here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6540760","6557800"," So zero dates gamma distribution of 4,240 and 4,260 and so 4,200 is big in terms of zero dates."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6561880","6566120"," Yeah we also have more puts being rolled lower than 4,200."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6568520","6573640"," So yeah I want you to know I'm going to talk to you guys about some right now so 4,200 on SPX"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6575560","6581000"," is kind of the place where you don't want to lose that as a bull right so as a bull I want"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6581000","6588360"," you to know a few things. Number one you do not want to lose 4,200. Number two I think I don't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6588360","6592760"," know if I showed you this earlier but I talked to you about the new puts let me see if I can show"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6592760","6598040"," you this. Let me see if I can actually show it to you on the form of a chart hold on here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6601560","6603480"," I was I was talking about it earlier."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6605800","6610760"," So there's been there's been a role of puts down to 410"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6613160","6616280"," and let me see if I can pull it up here for you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6619000","6626520"," Actually 4,000 they've rolled down to 4,000 at this point. Let me see if I can"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6635880","6642680"," see I can show this to you."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6648600","6654360"," So I want you to see this chart here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6656280","6658520"," This chart right here is current."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6661880","6668520"," This is current as of today so pay attention to the rolling of puts. Do you see them down here?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6669480","6674120"," So they rolled puts down now to 4,000, 4,000, 10."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6675240","6682360"," Massive, massive puts down here and there's some calls down there too but they did roll into this"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6682360","6689800"," 4,000, 10, 4,000 and 4,000, 10. So just be conscious. So this 4,200 right here."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6690840","6694520"," You don't want to see us break. I don't think I can put a tool up. I don't think I can draw this"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6694520","6701800"," but I draw on this or no. Maybe not. If you just follow my cursor I want you to pay attention to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6701800","6707400"," my cursor is right here. You don't want to give up this 420. If you give this 420 it opens the door"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6707400","6714680"," to 410 and more and more scarily 4,000 down here. Do you see that on my cursor right there?"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6715560","6720680"," So it is important imperative. So we're trading 422 right now. It is important and imperative"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6720680","6726520"," that we don't break that 420 on SPX specifically 4,200 not on spy."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6739160","6744040"," Well, I want to pull to know that like so they didn't close up their puts that we don't we don't"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6744040","6750680"," know what's fascinating about this too is have they not rolled their puts listen closely here okay."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6752600","6760840"," Had the market not rolled their puts into lower strikes i.e. 4,000 we'd likely be trading that this"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6760840","6771640"," week. So if the market was unhedged into 4,000, 410 there's a very good chance we'd be trading"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6771640","6779320"," that this week next week. Now the fact that the market has hedged to 4,000 and 410"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6780600","6788280"," it does to some extent unless we start breaking 420 or 4,200 it's going to act as a buffer for"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6788280","6794040"," must going down there to 4,000. I know that doesn't make any sense to you but I'm trying to simplify"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6794040","6801720"," it as best I can. So after or after after the past couple bad days we've had we saw our extra"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6801720","6807960"," let me rephrase this. After Q3 ended we did not have a hedge on the market but they've been adding"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6807960","6815400"," a hedge the past few days. So someone out there is buying a shit ton of 410 or 411 zeros and 4,000"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6815400","6821960"," puts on SPX they didn't a couple days ago but they are right now. So these fucking guys are coming"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6821960","6827560"," out and loading the fucking boat on puts and that typically results in the market going higher"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6827560","6838280"," once it's well hedged. So it's it's kind of a kind of a bullish thing there can be construed as bullish"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6841000","6847560"," that we had more risk to the downside on September 1st second third there was there was no hedge"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6847560","6851640"," all that hedging that came off was not replaced but it has since been replaced."
"heGjOQMKsD4","6857960","6864920"," Oh yeah yeah and they're all new too they're not old they're not from like they're not from"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6864920","6870680"," the beginning of this the quarter they're from today so they'll have a tendency to repel"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6870680","6882200"," who's ready for that fucking squeeze by the way you guys ready for the rip I want to warn you"
"heGjOQMKsD4","6882200","6885800"," to make sure I'm gonna warn you really quick before I take this break I'm gonna I'm gonna need"

"heGjOQMKsD4","7345160","7352200"," any way shape or form what i do trust right now for a bull is i trust any not any but any time"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7352760","7359640"," we come back and test and stay above the hourly trigger so i'm gonna trust that trigger right"

"heGjOQMKsD4","7365560","7370840"," whenever we get there with a stop underneath it i know i can buy this green bar this green bar"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7370840","7377880"," right here i can currently buy i can buy it and where's my target as long as i'm buying that green"

"heGjOQMKsD4","7408360","7413880"," this daily trigger to float down to four thirty five somewhere in here we talked about this"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7413880","7419240"," last week i said to you by the time we come up to test the daily trigger it should be at four"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7419240","7425720"," thirty five it's not there right now but it's almost there and do i think bulls can get there"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7425720","7433720"," is the next question right i do i think because of where we are that we can get there i think that"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7433720","7440440"," we can trade this weekly trigger sell off of it and look for some help from the green bar"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7441080","7446840"," to squeeze and trade this four thirty six sixty three which should be four thirty five"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7446840","7451800"," whether that's this week or next week i don't know right but i do think we're going to squeeze it"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7451800","7455640"," now if we do squeeze this i'm going to give you some fair warning here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7456520","7464680"," if we hard reject not just reject the daily trigger but we hard reject and start to come"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7464680","7472920"," underneath the weekly trigger and the hourly trigger reverses on us so we squeeze up here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7472920","7480040"," and then this this this hourly trigger is up here it's up here but then price breaks below the daily"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7480840","7486920"," week or hourly and weekly i'm going to get some real fucking bear on here so this right here"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7487720","7493000"," i'm going to get really bearish if you are a bull you want to see price break above"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7493560","7498120"," you want to see the hourly trigger catch up you want to break above you want to see the hourly"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7498120","7503640"," trigger break up and you want to see price hold above four thirty five you must get that if you"

"heGjOQMKsD4","7992840","7997880"," with guns so basically everybody has a gun with each other's head and they're like who's going to"
"heGjOQMKsD4","7997880","8005960"," exit the market first is it me or you and i'm making this point because if we do reject that"
