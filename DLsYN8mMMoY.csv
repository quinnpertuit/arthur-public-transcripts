"493640","494380"," Is that better?"
"494500","495460"," I bet you guys can hear me now."
"496320","498440"," I just been talking for the past 10 minutes here."
"499820","503360"," And I've been talking to myself. "
"518880","520500"," Okay, so we'll start with."
"526440","527640"," So it looks like the late."
"528420","529940"," So it looks like the latency. "
"533420","534380"," You can hear me now."
"534640","534800"," Okay."
"535300","539100"," Yeah, so it looks like the latency problem is being solved. "
"539780","541040"," So let me start at the beginning."
"541720","546200"," I read down, we downloaded Java to my computer."
"547180","552680"," And then I went to book map and they upgraded me to a better version of our newer version of"
"552680","553200"," book map. "
"553780","559940"," And the old version of book map was only allowing me to use two to four gigabytes of RAM and"
"559940","562180"," I have 16 gigs available to use."
"563200","569940"," So the new version automatically provides them with four gigs to run book map."
"570440","574820"," So there shouldn't be any issues with book map at this point crashing. "
"578020","585600"," And then I called my internet service provider and they upgraded me to the fiber type connection."
"586380","589320"," So supposedly I've got the best internet I can get."
"590180","592360"," So this should work at this point. "
"592720","602300"," And it looks like on, it looks like on from what my monitor is saying that my YouTube is within"
"602300","603740"," a minute right now."
"604280","607820"," You guys are, the delay right now is less than a minute."
"608140","610000"," So this should be a better set set up. "
"613590","615790"," Yeah, so let's talk about, let's talk about this stuff."
"616330","619270"," So let's start with, there's a few things you guys got to understand."
"619270","627010"," Right now, what's going on just at a baseline is you've still have consolidation in the markets. "
"627010","629350"," You look at something like spy over here."
"630230","636450"," And you still have, well, we're down on buyers right now, but it's even Steven on buyers, basically"
"636450","637670"," the markets are moving sideways."
"638450","646130"," We're not catching a bit on popular tickers to expand volatility. "
"646130","650470"," So you've got a compression of volatility right now in the market, which means it's going to go"
"650470","654370"," sideways means that buyers are replacing sellers."
"656170","662010"," And until the market has a direction, I'm assuming that the markets waiting for the banks to place"
"662010","662590"," their hedging."
"663450","669770"," Then we'll find, we'll find that the rest of the buyers and sellers will decide if they're going to"
"669770","674310"," go long or short this market, which will expand volatility in the market so we can make some moves. "
"676190","682290"," Now, on a more granular level, you can play individual tickers."
"683390","690470"," If, if you see expansion, you want to be seeing calls or puts that are dated farther than this"
"690470","690750"," Friday."
"691430","694370"," So you'll see some of that in flow, I'll go, I've posted some of that today. "
"695750","697010"," MU is one of those tickers."
"699890","704930"," But otherwise, if everyone's playing the same 480 calls expiring Friday, you're not going to see"
"704930","706790"," any movements in the market."
"708050","710070"," So basically, it's just sideways right now. "
"710270","711810"," That same thing is happening in Tesla."
"714420","721420"," Everyone's playing, everyone's buying the dip down at 1040, 1050, 1070, 1080, 1090, and then you've"
"721420","724720"," got a wall above it at 1100 and 1120."
"724720","731160"," And none of the calls that I've seen on Tesla is outside the money either. "
"731320","733580"," There's no, there's no put flow that's outside the money."
"733940","738780"," All the put flows in the money, all the call flows in the money, all of it is expiring this"
"738780","740420"," Friday, which is not good enough."
"740420","744660"," It just lends more credence to the compression of volatility in the market. "
"745520","749340"," Now, as an example, slightly different is MU."
"749340","752980"," You can see that the hero indicator is much higher here."
"753420","755460"," You've got a rating of 9653. "
"756000","757280"," It's been like that all day long."
"757840","759600"," That's a very good for MU."
"760840","764580"," Their wall is at 100 and they're just grinding through 97. "
"765180","766460"," That's what's been happening all day long."
"766960","771900"," My assumption for what we have in front of us for data is that whether it happens today or"
"771900","775480"," tomorrow, that there should be a push to 100 at some point today."
"775480","782040"," Now, if you guys are tracking call flow out there, there are, we've talked about what you're"
"782040","782620"," looking for. "
"782720","787140"," You're looking for calls or puts."
"787840","793940"," So if you started to see puts that were outside the money dated into January, February, March, if"
"793940","800940"," you started to see call flow that was dated at 500, 520, 530, that would start to lend expansion to"
"800940","801460"," the market."
"801460","809780"," So what you're just seeing is you're seeing this grind take place Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"810200","819120"," The only fear that I have at this point would be that this continues in the popular retail tickers"
"819120","820460"," in two Thursday, Friday."
"820760","823540"," If that's the case, you'll see us slowly drift down."
"824240","831000"," Though there is a, there is an idea in the market that JPM is not selling calls above that they're"
"831000","831560"," actually buying. "
"832140","836560"," So if they're buying, if they put 10, 15 billion into this market, it should go up."
"836980","839840"," Now, with the hedges falling off, there will be some weakness from that."
"840000","841360"," It could be temporary over the weekend. "
"841920","843280"," We talked about Friday into Monday."
"844460","846780"," But, you know, of course, no one's doing anything."
"846780","848740"," It's this feedback. "
"848820","850140"," It's like the feedback loop again."
"850280","853820"," It's all retail are playing the same stocks as the hedge funds."
"853980","860920"," The hedge funds are playing the same stocks as the banks, and then we're playing ETF space and"
"860920","861720"," ETFs. "
"862880","868420"," And so everybody knows where we are in the market and no one's willing to take some risk in either"
"868420","868860"," direction."
"868860","871220"," And what is that?"
"871300","872040"," Where does that leave us?"
"872440","875640"," It leaves us in a part of the market where we're just going to go sideways."
"876660","877080"," It sucks. "
"877420","879060"," Unless you're playing the individual tickers."
"879600","884500"," I did, I did just post on Twitter, the expanded call flow on MU."
"884820","887020"," It has, it's the number one call flow in the market today. "
"887480","889060"," As far as flow, I'll go as concerned."
"890720","896440"," The second best call flow is Apple then Tesla, but even, but when you're looking at these, this"
"896440","898700"," call flow, there's no expansion in it."
"899400","903060"," Like, there's no, there's no risk being put on. "
"903060","904840"," Neo has some call flow."
"904940","913140"," They've got eight orders at $1.4 million, and videos got some debt buying XLF's got some buying."
"914440","916120"," There's one nice one I like here. "
"916300","923140"," It's S.R.P.T. S.R.P.T. They have a February 18th 100 call."
"923760","925280"," You want it for $800,000."
"926040","931020"," So like you see stuff like that, and that helps the expansion on an individual ticker. "
"931020","936480"," But we really are looking for more flow than we're seeing today."
"938810","943750"," So who does that, who does that benefit benefit or who's that benefit of benefits anyone trading"
"943750","944930"," condors."
"947330","951030"," Butterflies, it benefits anyone that's in spreads that are in the money. "
"951450","955990"," So if you have, if we, we talked about spreads on Sunday and Monday, so if you'd opened up, let's"
"955990","960050"," say it in the money call spread, you should be fine heading into this one."
"960150","962230"," This Wednesday or Friday expiry and that stuff."
"963750","965410"," I've got some straddles out there. "
"966010","970190"," I'm going to straddle left out there on the spine for depending on which direction it goes in."
"970850","974750"," And I'll add to whichever side ends up printing as we head forward."
"978940","979300"," Yeah. "
"979820","983160"," You guys have any tickers as a group that you want me to put up, I will."
"984120","985360"," Easy to lose money."
"985940","986880"," Data getting is winning. "
"987480","988920"," Sometimes Andy looks like it's traveling."
"989300","991720"," Yeah, you know, I can bring up AMD if you want."
"992060","993000"," I'll show you guys that AMD. "
"994960","999860"," Plus I want to run this through the, I want to run this through the, want to run this through"
"999860","1002560"," the motions here and see if we get any more crashing."
"1006870","1015200"," I really like to see if we're, if this, if this setup is going to work."
"1015200","1019400"," It's pretty good right there, right?"
"1019640","1019720"," 148. "
"1021340","1023500"," We'll let this kick in here with this load up."
"1034900","1038460"," Yeah, let me just a few minutes let this, let this all kick in and start doing its thing."
"1042900","1046240"," You got support down here at 145.09 on AMD. "
"1047620","1053160"," You have a slightly, slightly better, slightly more ball buyers and collars."
"1054420","1061980"," One fair, one bad thing you're looking at here is that this hero indicator is not positive for AMD."
"1063000","1068780"," You know, a small wall above it, 152, 154 is a big wall kind of bigger level. "
"1070000","1071420"," This might help you here too."
"1071920","1076320"," You have, you have lots of resistance above it, 160 and 165."
"1077620","1079900"," I think we talked about 160 being the wall the other day. "
"1079900","1083380"," I think on Monday or Tuesday, we said 160 was the wall on AMD."
"1090940","1092120"," Isn't this much better, right?"
"1092780","1101020"," Yeah, I had to, I had to, I had to update Java."
"1101720","1104880"," That was based on man for markets recommended that so I did that. "
"1105440","1109260"," Then I had to go through book Mac support and that took like an hour and a half to do"
"1109260","1109980"," a bunch of upgrades."
"1111000","1115420"," And then I had to upgrade my internet from, my internet speed was great."
"1115420","1122060"," It was like 300 megabytes per second or something, but I upgraded it to a gigabyte. "
"1122520","1125640"," So one like the giga speed or something fiber."
"1127580","1133140"," So I just upgraded to fiber or something, whatever they think fiber is or whatever bullshit they're"
"1133140","1133400"," selling."
"1134540","1136100"," So I've separated that. "
"1139270","1141230"," We'll do a snap next."
"1143450","1144250"," Everything's better."
"1144250","1145990"," Yeah, you know, we'll work out the kinks. "
"1146090","1148030"," This is all new for us, right as a group."
"1148330","1152910"," So I promise you guys, we'll get this thing hammered out, get it pimping."
"1154230","1159190"," It's just going to take some time to work out the kinks and all that kind of stuff. "
"1159770","1166230"," But I appreciate you being patient with me and we'll make sure we get this, this rolling properly."
"1168910","1171150"," Yeah, the latency is not bad."
"1171330","1173430"," The latency is one minute. "
"1173430","1175170"," So that's pretty reasonable."
"1175570","1178330"," It was, it was dragging out to like five to 10 minutes earlier."
"1179090","1181910"," So we're, we're in, we're into the stream now for a little bit. "
"1182310","1183310"," So this is getting better."
"1186110","1188650"," I'm going to pull back at MU, going to likely hold my calls."
"1189130","1190430"," Yeah, I would stand calls at MU. "
"1190810","1196030"," It's look, it's all around, all the signs are pointing towards MU moving towards that 100."
"1196590","1202230"," The only issue that I had with MU was that some of the calls on MU were in the money."
"1202230","1208710"," They were like the 95 calls, but there is some expansion in people buying the 100 calls. "
"1209850","1215250"," And some 115 calls into January and February, and you really want to see that."
"1215310","1218370"," You want to see like calls into January calls into February."
"1218730","1222450"," When you start to see that it's healthy for a stock or even an ETF. "
"1224670","1231010"," So I'm big on, I'm very, very bullish right now on MU as a ticker and."
"1231790","1233350"," Let me get some water."
"1235370","1237030"," Could you get daddy some water, please?"
"1241440","1241960"," Thank you. "
"1242000","1242240"," Love you."
"1242980","1243500"," Okay."
"1244200","1244920"," All right. "
"1245640","1246320"," I love you."
"1248970","1252550"," So yeah, so MU has great expansion."
"1253170","1256790"," I think I'll post another one here on MU for just a second here. "
"1256870","1262150"," I want to show you guys why you're looking for like the structure that you're looking for."
"1262450","1265130"," There's a bunch of cues calls coming in."
"1266410","1270550"," Like, like everything I'm seeing coming in and all that, like, like everything coming in spy. "
"1271610","1274730"," And the cues is all dated for 1229."
"1276070","1276510"," 1231."
"1277530","1278230"," All in the money. "
"1279130","1283150"," And when you have MU having nice expansion and dates."
"1284290","1284950"," Expansion in."
"1288430","1289090"," I don't know. "
"1289170","1289590"," I don't know."
"1289670","1291650"," Yeah, I'm going to do another one for you guys right now."
"1292090","1294170"," Check this one that I post right now on Twitter. "
"1294170","1296590"," And then you, then you can see what I'm saying."
"1296790","1303930"," You can then understand my point behind you have to see this stuff for volatility or an increase"
"1303930","1305450"," in."
"1309930","1311430"," Trading range, right?"
"1311910","1314210"," This, this applies to if you, if it was puts. "
"1314950","1316150"," You want to think you love you."
"1316670","1317130"," Thanks for the water."
"1319790","1320530"," It's delicious. "
"1322670","1325150"," So I'm going to post this right now on Twitter."
"1325150","1331370"," And you would, you can see that there's breadth on the ticker itself."
"1332150","1337770"," You're going to see that there's calls for February calls for January calls for right now. "
"1337770","1340210"," And that means that people believe it's going up."
"1340470","1341470"," And what, what does that mean?"
"1341910","1348850"," It means that the dealers have to hedge for that, for that inevitability that I mean is going up."
"1349130","1351470"," It means that they're going to buy physical. "
"1352510","1357350"," Shares of MU to hedge against the price moving up to 100."
"1357610","1359550"," The price moving up to 115."
"1360270","1365730"," If everybody's buying spy at 480, they don't have to head the dealers don't have to hedge that. "
"1366330","1369430"," So we're not, we're just not seeing that in a lot of tickers right now."
"1369810","1373870"," So you have to, we have to drill down and find out which tickers are getting that expansion."
"1374410","1378330"," So if you have your own flow software out there, you want to be looking for. "
"1379310","1379910"," Multiple."
"1381770","1382370"," Multiple."
"1384290","1385650"," High algo score. "
"1387370","1391930"," Options trades and more, you know, more, more equity buying."
"1393070","1398730"," But options trades that are dated farther out, dated at higher numbers and that goes for the same"
"1398730","1399530"," on puts to."
"1400030","1404030"," You're looking for that as well on the indexes and on individual tickers. "
"1404030","1406330"," So MU to me."
"1407990","1409390"," MU to me will go to 100."
"1409830","1412130"," I don't know how long it'll take to go to 100, but I'm seeing it. "
"1412170","1413390"," I think it's going to 100."
"1414010","1417610"," And, or at least if I'm going to put some risk on, this is the one that I'd be putting"
"1417610","1418310"," some risk on."
"1419250","1425190"," The hero indicator has been blasting all day long on the positive side. "
"1426550","1428510"," So that's one I'm picking AMD."
"1429590","1432710"," It's not AMD really wasn't showing anything positive on it today."
"1432710","1438930"," You do have more buyers, but the hero indicator, if the hero indicator stays down over time, that"
"1438930","1443090"," could be inferring that there'll be a larger dip coming down the road for it. "
"1445260","1448320"," We bring up AMD on my screener."
"1449660","1450220"," Yeah."
"1451320","1452900"," And then we'll do snap next. "
"1480510","1481510"," Just a few minutes."
"1481510","1482250"," Okay, sweetheart."
"1483850","1486530"," I'm going to leave one of these screeners up. "
"1486530","1507260"," Oh, I do"
"1507260","1508400"," like snap right now."
"1511070","1512930"," I like this consolidation on snap."
"1519060","1523600"," I like the idea of snap to the hedging coming up snap. "
"1525060","1533040"," I've got a list of tickers that I'm working on a list for Sunday for what I'm going to track"
"1533040","1536780"," into 2022 to buy."
"1538240","1541280"," I haven't bought any stock in some time."
"1541280","1546260"," Okay, so snap your your your wall right now is at 5150. "
"1550570","1556330"," You can see that you've got a minor wall at 51 starts at 5088."
"1556970","1562190"," Your next minor resistance is at 5941 and major resistance at 65."
"1563030","1565590"," I like snap right now to be honest with you. "
"1567670","1568730"," It's got great hero."
"1570270","1571590"," It's got more sellers."
"1572850","1574430"," It doesn't surprise me. "
"1574430","1577630"," It looks like you do have like a traditional chart."
"1577830","1584490"," You could draw a trend line that you've got to wear out some sellers on that resist."
"1584730","1586830"," You got this nice resistance right there. "
"1589280","1593620"," It makes me think that it's short short time players in snap."
"1594880","1601160"," And I haven't seen much in terms of three, six, five month calls on snap."
"1601360","1603040"," I really want to see a cascade of that stuff. "
"1603040","1608640"," I'll put that back here for you."
"1608800","1613100"," You guys can always pause and then refresh your page and come back to the current."
"1615100","1615920"," Current feed. "
"1616720","1618380"," I'm going to subscribe from this one."
"1619120","1624180"," I'm going to leave the MU feed up I think for today for you guys so that."
"1626450","1627870"," I'm going to leave for right now. "
"1627930","1632510"," I'm going to leave the MU feed up because it is it is from all indicators."
"1632510","1633950"," The one that should be going up."
"1639320","1640860"," So I'm going to leave this one up. "
"1641760","1649160"," So that these all signs are pointing towards MU going up."
"1649400","1651140"," It's the ticket that we've been talking about all morning."
"1651680","1653480"," There's no movement on the spy or Tesla. "
"1664770","1666250"," Let's see what you guys are talking about."
"1666730","1668770"," What's my timeframe on for snap."
"1669490","1670790"," Okay, so let's talk about. "
"1670930","1672110"," Let's talk about what we."
"1672330","1673890"," So let's talk about this for a minute."
"1674390","1684140"," So right now I'm spending time on Finviz trying to identify"
"1684140","1686700"," stocks to look at for. "
"1687740","1692180"," Like a basket of stocks to track into 2022."
"1693360","1695380"," And then I'm trying to figure out."
"1696300","1699480"," What I think 22 22 holds for us. "
"1700120","1701240"," So I have to put together."
"1703650","1706290"," I have to I'm waiting for the hedges to come out myself."
"1706690","1711410"," I want to see what the hedges are in the 31st or 31st, but on the 30th and 31st. "
"1712070","1716330"," I want to see what the big banks are thinking we're going to do in the new year."
"1716330","1722330"," I want to listen to a couple other guys out there with what they think."
"1723450","1727290"," The medium and long term projections are. "
"1727510","1729970"," This isn't the volatility projections either that."
"1730630","1733410"," I've always was talking about because you can't predict that stuff."
"1733550","1734630"," It's all unknown stuff. "
"1735110","1737350"," There's so many unknown events that you don't know about, right?"
"1737910","1741490"," But you have to take in risk risk events that we know coming in."
"1741790","1744290"," Joe donut and I a few minutes ago were talking about."
"1744290","1747070"," You know, you've got the midterm elections we got to think about. "
"1747290","1747970"," We got to think about."
"1750290","1750770"," Tapering."
"1750950","1751650"," We have to think about. "
"1754120","1755080"," Rate increases."
"1755660","1756520"," We have to think about."
"1759240","1761860"," All the the cacophony of. "
"1763580","1766760"," The CNBC's and the social media's hedge funds."
"1767020","1768660"," What they're telling you is going to happen, right?"
"1770930","1773110"," And from all that crap we have to we have to deduce."
"1773750","1776310"," Where the play will actually be this year. "
"1776310","1776870"," So."
"1778090","1783310"," I'm looking at these stocks wondering when and at what price you want to buy them."
"1783870","1786290"," Where bottom is for some of these stocks. "
"1786810","1789270"," If we can get a basket of one to 300 stocks."
"1790170","1794190"," My plan would be this if if between now and."
"1794730","1796550"," The first of the year. "
"1797110","1802130"," If I could get together somewhere between a hundred and 300 stocks, right?"
"1803030","1804350"," We chart them out."
"1805430","1808990"," And we set an alert program on them on trading view."
"1810070","1813250"," What we could do is I think I can do this. "
"1813510","1817510"," I think that I'm trading view what I could do is I can chart these stocks out."
"1818050","1818670"," To set alerts."
"1820570","1826310"," And whenever one of these stocks hit an area, we want to buy them in that would be alerted. "
"1826310","1830550"," And it's funny because hood is in that buy zone right now."
"1830770","1831670"," It hit its first alert."
"1832730","1834090"," And it's now inside. "
"1834570","1837050"," I made a post somewhere on one of my two handles."
"1837550","1839590"," I made an alert saying I'd buy it."
"1840330","1844310"," I think I made a video a short video or I made a post about. "
"1844910","1846950"," Hey, would you own it at 20, 15 or $10."
"1848250","1848690"," And."
"1849410","1851930"," You know, it's interesting because I wouldn't put hood. "
"1852210","1854190"," If you asked me yesterday, would you put hood on your list?"
"1854190","1856150"," I probably would say no to you."
"1856750","1861940"," But if it gets to the right price for next year, right?"
"1862180","1866060"," If you're starting to think about the right price for tickers."
"1866800","1868480"," If next, let's say next year. "
"1869500","1871300"," Let's say next year we have."
"1872920","1874820"," Our normal down month in March."
"1875620","1878260"," We have a small ER run, let's say, beginning a year. "
"1879360","1882660"," And then let's say we trade sideways."
"1884260","1886500"," Or let's say we trade in a range, right?"
"1887040","1890080"," Let's say we're sideways, but we're ranging up and down throughout the summer."
"1890620","1895140"," Then we have a big old shit moment at the either in the middle of summer. "
"1895280","1896380"," Let's say July or something."
"1896380","1897480"," We just fall off a cliff."
"1899540","1901520"," And then we trade down into winter. "
"1903040","1904780"," And we kind of reset the market."
"1905400","1908360"," And that's that's the kind of the prevailing thought of what's going to happen this year."
"1909100","1916000"," My only, my only argument against that is we usually have these cycles of up years. "
"1916680","1919220"," Like four up years and then four down years."
"1922140","1925880"," And right now we don't, right now we have only finished three up years."
"1926100","1928380"," We still have one more up here and in front of us. "
"1928920","1933500"," So there is this, there is this outlier that we go way high this year."
"1934200","1936080"," And I have to do more math on it."
"1936080","1939320"," But there is this very small chance. "
"1941200","1943880"," There is this very small chance that we have."
"1945940","1948200"," This fits more of the bear thesis."
"1949200","1951780"," And if you're a bear, if you're a real bear out there. "
"1952480","1957760"," The bear thesis would be that we, we rocket to we go straight vertical this year."
"1959080","1965000"," And then that would bring in the onset of a really nasty next year, like 2022 would be monstrous."
"1965680","1970300"," And then 2023 would just be, you'd see companies imploding and stuff. "
"1970460","1971760"," You'd see like, you know, it'd be bad."
"1972440","1973120"," Real bad."
"1973340","1977220"," The inflation would finally kick in, like legitimately kick in. "
"1977420","1978760"," It's not that we, it's already kicked in."
"1978840","1979660"," We know inflation's here."
"1980300","1984360"," Like I believe in all everything the bears say out there, but the mechanics of it, how it works"
"1984360","1987180"," within our market isn't playing out right now. "
"1987520","1990520"," We, we're projecting what we think is going to happen in 2022."
"1991180","1993860"," Like a responsible person in reality."
"1993860","1995580"," We're like drunken fools. "
"1996040","1997140"," You know, we're like, we're like drunks."
"1997680","2000780"," I, I don't subscribe to the banks, not breaking shit."
"2000900","2006900"," I think that you break things and you run things for, for max profit until you break it. "
"2008520","2010960"," So I feel like banks do that."
"2011140","2013580"," They have a, they have a strong history of doing that shit."
"2015860","2020460"," So I'm still not convinced on my, on my position for 2022. "
"2020460","2024900"," I really do want to see what the banks hedge with as we head into the end of the year"
"2024900","2025060"," here."
"2025420","2029260"," It's a big moment for the, for the markets of see how they're hedging into."
"2030780","2038940"," Into 2022 because, you know, if you end up seeing, if you end up seeing. "
"2040320","2043220"," The hedging being only like let's say 450."
"2046060","2047159"," You know, that's not a."
"2048219","2052739"," You know, that they're going to tell you, Hey, I'm only expecting, I think the media, the mean"
"2052739","2055520"," expectation for this year was what 505."
"2056199","2059460"," That was the mean, maybe the average might have even been that. "
"2060719","2063520"," Out of these banks, these banks always get it wrong."
"2063540","2064380"," They never get it right."
"2067679","2069560"," And they could just be a mad dash. "
"2069639","2072560"," I mean, we've had that stealth correction going on across the market."
"2076270","2079030"," You know, on the underside of our markets been stealth correcting."
"2079030","2082370"," And we could get lopsided. "
"2082530","2084850"," We could be trading this whole next year."
"2087460","2090940"," From a value bear standpoint, and yet."
"2092000","2093139"," They're going to run it up. "
"2093860","2096280"," You know, I think there's that small chance."
"2097520","2098960"," So I still have to look at it."
"2099100","2100560"," I still, I'm still not convinced. "
"2101420","2103940"," But my thought process in this plan would be."
"2104740","2111550"," That we're going to be looking for undervalued stocks, right?"
"2111550","2115430"," We want to start with undervalued stocks and we want to make sure that the banks are pushing them."
"2116110","2120030"," And I was, I commented on Twitter earlier today to take a look at home, at Home Depot. "
"2120550","2122350"," You know, Home Depot is always going up."
"2122490","2128350"," It's always been going up since the last crash that we had in 0708."
"2129890","2133910"," But it's gone up extremely high in the past three months in September. "
"2134570","2135750"," So it's like low hanging fruit."
"2136210","2139410"," So it's like, do they dump those bags on you as a value investor?"
"2139930","2144790"," Because it's they're easy targets, or do they get or does it get driven up higher?"
"2145430","2150680"," Or is the play really not in Home Depot?"
"2151120","2152660"," Because yeah, you guys saw target, right?"
"2152880","2154160"," Target was was whacked."
"2154600","2156480"," It was now it got taken down. "
"2157000","2158840"," That's below it's 200 day moving average."
"2158840","2161000"," There's there's a bunch of different other tickers out there."
"2161160","2163500"," You look at Ring doorbell, it got knocked down. "
"2164180","2165060"," There's another one."
"2165160","2167340"," There was another tech company that I was looking at earlier."
"2169300","2172220"," That was not that's on a great trend that the banks push. "
"2172220","2175840"," So I think we just have to find a basket of maybe one to 300 stocks."
"2177620","2183520"," Find out when they're hitting key levels and see if they get picked up by the banks."
"2183540","2187820"," If they do, we'll add those in and march them as we move through 2022. "
"2194840","2196260"," What's going on?"
"2200390","2203850"," Thanks again to fail because people can't pay their date."
"2203850","2207970"," That's when when rates rise."
"2209050","2209430"," Okay. "
"2209870","2210950"," Yeah, let's talk about that."
"2211710","2214290"," Let's talk about what what is the name?"
"2214510","2215250"," Crino PP."
"2216790","2224250"," Crino PP just said banks are going to fail because people can't pay their debts when rates rise. "
"2225110","2226110"," Okay, that's a great point."
"2226290","2227270"," Let's talk about that real quick."
"2227270","2232210"," Let's talk about what Crino's saying. "
"2232990","2241350"," Crino, let me ask you a question real quick about the banks are going to fail when people can't pay"
"2241350","2243590"," their debts when rates rise."
"2244250","2246110"," Crino, how long have you been talking about that?"
"2247710","2250590"," Can you post on on YouTube right now?"
"2251150","2252630"," How long you've been telling people that?"
"2261060","2264020"," Can you tell me how long you've been telling me that banks are going to fail?"
"2264020","2272020"," Crino, you still there, buddy?"
"2289890","2290690"," Too funny."
"2291810","2292510"," He's gone. "
"2293210","2293870"," That's hilarious."
"2294390","2295150"," Yeah, that's the point."
"2295870","2300110"," So, you know, when you hear stuff like that, this guy, this guy, Crino. "
"2300770","2302770"," Let's talk about this guy, Crino real quick."
"2305500","2309000"," Let's talk about Crino because he's important to listen to."
"2316390","2318950"," And what it is is that you. "
"2327280","2328180"," So you've got this."
"2328360","2329040"," So you get this guy."
"2329200","2330260"," You get this guy. "
"2330380","2332780"," You know, you hear this message out there."
"2332840","2334000"," You hear this from bulls too."
"2334480","2336920"," You know, you hear this message from bulls and from bears. "
"2337500","2341980"," And these are the people that you can't listen to because these are the people that will lose you"
"2341980","2342200"," money."
"2342480","2343460"," You're going to lose money."
"2343480","2344040"," Listen to bulls. "
"2344240","2345020"," Talk like that guy."
"2345460","2346020"," You're going to listen."
"2346240","2347840"," You're going to lose money from listening to bears. "
"2347840","2348900"," is to talk like that guy."
"2349600","2352380"," It's just this like blanket coverage that you're all gonna die."
"2353280","2357120"," And it doesn't really work right as a trader or as an investor it doesn't work. "
"2357480","2358600"," It doesn't work as a trader."
"2359260","2360260"," It doesn't work taking shorts."
"2361020","2365860"," If you were to take a short every time someone like that told you short the banks you'd be broke"
"2365860","2366560"," right now right?"
"2367160","2367960"," You guys all know that?"
"2375540","2377120"," You guys do realize that right?"
"2378780","2380460"," That's just what do you guys want me to look at next?"

"2399900","2406840"," they don't invest they don't short they don't buy puts they don't live off that money they're just"
"2406840","2412520"," out there spouting shit out in the internet world or whatever you know it's kind of goofy when you"
"2412520","2420920"," hear shit like that that's something that I'd expect from like a main streeter something my"
"2420920","2425240"," grandfather would tell me something that it's something that I talk about you know I'll have a"
"2425240","2429420"," conversation like that at a barbecue with someone that doesn't you know it's just some regular guy"
"2429420","2435400"," in the street I'll have that conversation but when it comes to making money you know it's funny"
"2435400","2442260"," about that too is if you look at Japan there were American short American hedge funds like us based"
"2442260","2448280"," hedge funds that tried to short the Japanese market for a decade and a half and went bankrupt doing"

"2845210","2852990"," 10 to 15 billion dollars the market's going to go up definitely then we get that they get that"
"2852990","2859030"," hedge roll off on the 31st and then you're going to see a nice fat dip and then we'll come"
"2859030","2868700"," back from that we'll buy that dip yeah okay so"
"2869520","2878620"," I'm going to make a video for this so about this stuff so the triangles these are options so we"
"2878620","2883900"," have got live equity flow that's in here right this is the dome every time you guys see people on"
"2883900","2893660"," twitter talking about the Dom or the dome DoM that's the order book that's over here and"

"2900340","2909560"," buyers are above and below the red bands these are equities people want to sell equities here"
"2909560","2917820"," people want to sell equities here and then the bubbles are the how large the blocks of buying is"
"2917820","2925000"," right so is it just small blocks of buying or large blocks of buying this is a good indicator the"
"2925000","2932420"," larger the green or the larger the the red bubbles it shows who's buying right bigger banks are"
"2932420","2940090"," buying bigger hedge funds and you'll see when we get volatile that you'll see like more way more"
"2940090","2948510"," bubbles you'll see like big waves of bubbles you're also looking for below where the supply side is"
"2948510","2955510"," and the supply side right now the buy side right now is right at the money and this bubble showing"
"2955510","2961590"," you that the buyers are right at the money they're buying at 96 16 there's no buyers waiting below"
"2961590","2969290"," on specifically on MU you can see that all the buy side is up above there's some buyers down here"
"2969290","2977330"," at 80 bucks but in reality all the buyers are pushing right now on MU and that's why I like"
"2977330","2985050"," this if I if you saw a blue line down here it would it it shows that the smart money"
"2985050","2989570"," is waiting for a dip but when you don't see the buyers down here and they're up above right here"
"2989570","2995890"," that means that the buyers are being very aggressive now the triangles unlike equities are showing"
"2995890","3003790"," the option flow so you want and that's and these these green arrows and these red arrows are tied"
"3003790","3011790"," into this indicator called the hero indicator h i r o you can look videos up on youtube that"
"3011790","3018930"," explain in more depth what it infers but if you are watching this pink this this fuchsia or purple"
"3018930","3027750"," indicator pinkish indicator if it's running high all day long it is implying that prices will be"
"3027750","3033970"," higher later if it's running low all day long it is implying that prices will be lower later from"
"3033970","3045870"," the option flow if it runs in conjunction kind of flat it tends not to mean as much and also"
"3045870","3050730"," I think I can put the hero indicator on the actual map here but I haven't figured out how to"
"3050730","3056210"," do that one yet I have to figure I think I can put the hero actually on the map and"
"3056210","3059410"," I don't know why it's not on there right now I got to figure that out I'm going to figure"
"3059410","3064410"," out how to get the hero indicator on the on the physical map itself for you guys know how to"
"3064410","3074150"," do that let me know Neil saying yeah but presumably if jpms buying"
"3074150","3081100"," calls now they want to dip to buy it on so do you think that the dip will come then"
"3081100","3088920"," before friday you think you'll get the dip on thursday or how do they get their dip right they get"
"3088920","3093440"," their dip they'll plate what they'll end up doing is on let's say on thursday they would they would"
"3093440","3102530"," buy their put spreads right if they slam the market with put spreads on thursday with the they"
"3102530","3109530"," would they then grab would they then I'm an agreement with you on buying calls I think that they"
"3109530","3116890"," buy I think that they sell I mean my theory is different than what the regular the theory is right"
"3116890","3122490"," now that they're buying and my thought was that they'd be selling calls they'd be selling 520s 550s"
"3122490","3129710"," maybe buying put spreads at hopefully 450 if they buy 430 or 425 this fucking market's going to"
"3129710","3143220"," shift the bed oh thanks"
"3143220","3157240"," for the thanks Matthew I appreciate it yeah"
"3157240","3164860"," Rob runs Rob runs the long tail strategy Rob's probably probably very interested to see what the"
"3164860","3170160"," what the hedge is going to be I think most of the markets really the market's just waiting right"
"3170160","3175420"," now the big money is waiting to see what the fuck or what should be swear what what the F"
"3175420","3188280"," the banks are going to do I think the market's basically I'm paused right now take"
"3188280","3198200"," cap or hey hot-hut you have BI BIIB was a"
"3198200","3203080"," great ticker we called that one a couple weeks ago daddy didn't we can we call that like a week"
"3203080","3210120"," ago let's look at spy real quick where I really want to see what I really want to see if"
"3210120","3216460"," a buy program comes in and it's already kicking in right now we were at two we were at 185"
"3216460","3223260"," just a moment to go and you're seeing you're seeing increased volume right now heading into the end"
"3223260","3232590"," of the day in the spy it does make you wonder if they want to print those 480s"
"3232590","3242450"," yeah see Rob's Rob's waiting for it too I'm waiting for"
"3242450","3246950"," it too that's the thing is you really want to know what the banks are doing what they're hedging"
"3247450","3252870"," end of month and then I'm also waiting on you know I'm like waiting on hood to see if it"
"3252870","3258290"," dumps down to 10 or 15 on the 31st like there's a bunch of tickers that I'm looking at that"
"3258290","3263710"," I'm really want to see if they really really like capitulate those if they really just start"
"3263710","3269770"," dumping a bunch of stock into end of day Friday so you can get some real good steals or deals"
"3269770","3281590"," I don't"
"3281590","3285690"," know if you have an answer but I'm trying to figure out what in the money puts weeks or months"
"3285690","3291710"," out what accomplished okay so here here's here's the concept I'll give you the basic concept of it"
"3291710","3297270"," okay so let's say right now we drive the market up we're in the end of year right I drive"
"3297270","3307210"," the market up right now to 480 and I'm a bank right so what I'll do right"
"3307210","3311930"," now is I know of course I don't know even as a bank I don't know what the future holds"
"3311930","3318130"," I don't know what unknown events are I don't know what the other big banks are doing right I'm kind"
"3318130","3324530"," of friendly with other big banks but I'm not really I'm not really a friend of GSA from JPM I've"
"3324530","3330310"," got all that my own scientists are working on researchers and people working on what they expect us"
"3330310","3339290"," to do and JPM specifically runs long only too long only hedge funds they long the market that's"
"3339290","3344110"," what they do so what am I going to do for hedge in the market so the thought process is"
"3344110","3350010"," it depends on where we are and right now we're up on the market we're at 480 right we're not"
"3350010","3355730"," down the market's not down heading into this OPEX we're up we're at 480 so if we're at 480 right"
"3355730","3359890"," now what's my plan right now so I'm going to do a market projection see what I think the market's"
"3359890","3364710"," going to do what's how many rates come in blah blah all that other stuff and I'm going to project"
"3364710","3370070"," I'm going to say okay is I'm going to do I think the market's going to suck this year so"
"3370070","3380030"," I want to I want to buy put spreads they're like let's say 435 425"
"3380030","3387350"," right and I don't I think we're going to go sideways too so and I don't think I don't think"
"3387350","3391530"," that the spies going to go over 520 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to slam the"
"3391530","3396970"," market with selling and outside the money call right so let's say let's"
"3396970","3406630"," say and then I'm going to slam the market with"
"3406630","3416270"," some put spreads down to 425 and 435 right so I do that and I've got my projections and let's"
"3416270","3426240"," just say we start to sell down over this next three months to the 425 so I start"
"3426240","3431560"," to make my money right I'm making all my money I'm selling out of my positions right I'm a long"
"3431560","3435300"," only hedge fund I own a bunch of stock and a bunch of companies I'm selling out of my positions"
"3435300","3443140"," we're heading lower down to 425 435 my my put wet my my put spreads start to print for me"
"3443140","3448620"," right got them down at 425 because we're already up at 480 so now I'm printing out all my shit"
"3448620","3456080"," I'm a happy bank right I've just printed all my put all my put spreads now meanwhile I've got all"
"3456080","3464620"," those outside the money calls above me at 520 550 and I know that I can go up there to"
"3464620","3471700"," at least 520 before end of quarter I don't have to worry about those calls that I sold right I"
"3471700","3476720"," can buy this market and I can make money on the front end in front end those calls that I"
"3476720","3481560"," sold as long as we don't go past right as long as I don't go past where I sold those"
"3481560","3488360"," calls I'm not going to lose the underlying stock does that make sense or I can take it up to"
"3488360","3495800"," 500 510 and then dump it down on the tails to 425 and 435 depending if I bought or sold"
"3495800","3505600"," calls or puts so what they try to do is they swing it both ways"
"3505600","3511740"," and so when you when you hear when you hear people say they play the tails you want to know"
"3511740","3515920"," if they're buying or selling when we're when we're at the at OPEX because it'll give us an insight"
"3515920","3523980"," into the probability or what they're betting we're going to swing higher or lower in the first half"
"3523980","3529880"," of this quarter or swing lower at the back half of this quarter and how low are we going to"
"3529880","3536590"," go what's the implied move that we're going to make towards the end of year or not at the end"
"3536590","3558450"," of quarter excuse me yeah tech's"
"3558450","3564430"," starting to curl up yeah you see this buy program here 270 we're at 270 the buyers are overcoming"
"3564430","3570190"," the sellers in the spy right now TQQ curling up makes sense to me they're probably going to ram"
"3570190","3575990"," this in the clothes or it looks like they're going to try to ram it into clothes hero indicators"
"3575990","3583940"," off the charts right now for spy when I wonder what MU is going to do if MU is going"
"3583940","3593570"," to do that squeeze in the clothes as well but you can see spy ramping up right now you can"
"3593570","3598070"," see if you look down here in the right hand side bottom right hand side this hero indicator it's"
"3598070","3611040"," going off the charts right now it's blasting off it's like RPMs and you"
"3611040","3617460"," can see we're at almost double the volume heading in the clothes it's it's a bullish in context if"
"3617460","3627450"," you want to know I bet we hit 480 then fill"
"3627450","3636340"," it up 453 gap on spy and fab 500 by June I don't know it's right it's going up right"
"3636340","3643360"," now it's going up at the moment it's starting to flatten a little bit you guys can see right here"
"3643360","3648520"," it's starting to flatten slightly at this at this exact moment but there is a buy program on for"
"3648520","3658120"," sure yeah cautiously long with one foot out the door that's one of my favorite lines right there I"
"3658120","3664180"," love that cautiously long with one foot out the door we're at the top so I'll buy some hedging but"
"3664180","3674180"," I will take along that's exactly where we are right now so the hero indicator is"
"3674180","3680440"," down here you can see it on the bottom right hand side of your screen okay and it's cranking right"
"3680440","3686780"," now on the spy you guys want to pay attention to these numbers down here you see your buyers and"
"3686780","3692560"," sellers you're getting a slight dip in the spy right now you had one large cell order right here"
"3692560","3702450"," you had a 47734 y'all show you the Tesla book map no worries I'll"
"3702450","3708440"," put it up right now yeah it looks like a ram it looks like a ram it looks like we're"
"3708440","3715400"," ramming up if I had to guess sometimes they like to park it though on opx days I can't stand"
"3715400","3720560"," like one of the thing about opx days is sometimes they'll just park it they'll move it right to"
"3720560","3729240"," where they want it and then they just go sideways right into clothes that's always annoying and it"
"3729240","3735160"," looks like they might do that here which would piss me off if you were dead flat heading into the"
"3735160","3739960"," like from the open of this morning right into the close of today that'd be a real that'd be real"
"3739960","3748760"," bastards doing that and we'll do we'll do Tesla next let's look at MU real quick MU is still"
"3748760","3755200"," looking beautiful I got nothing bad to say about MU right now my target price is 100 at MU we're"
"3756580","3764940"," not playing zero dates at MU so it's not like it matters our MU is is MU is fitting what"
"3764940","3770920"," we want every stock and index to be if you're a bull it's fitting it's fitting the bill right now"

"3790440","3797720"," is up on MU right now although it's hitting all the targets you want you know at some point you"
"3797720","3802420"," have take some risk in this market you might lose some you might win some but everything looks"

"8738780","8746620"," not going anywhere so does that mean it's going to pin arc for a whole year two years i'd assume"
"8746620","8756490"," that it's just fighting between banks maybe uh bill knows more about this if he's or rob or bill"
"8756490","8774300"," if they're here why would you buy puts above the current price four three years out by"
