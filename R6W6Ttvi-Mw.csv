"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","0","29000"," Yee-hoo doggy, we're up and running again, I gotta change all these, uh, left this here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","29000","34000"," Alright, let's see what we're doing here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","34000","38000"," We got a lot to do, we got a lot to cover to."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","38000","42000"," What's going on, bear town chair, I see you out there, what up?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","42000","45000"," Oke the juice box."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","45000","48000"," You guys hear me out there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","48000","54000"," I don't know if you guys can actually hear me across over the, over the, uh, intros."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","60000","63000"," Brown air, brown air."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","67000","69000"," Oh, you can't hear me."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","69000","72000"," I didn't think you guys could hear me over the, uh, intros."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","76000","78000"," Hold on a second, here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","85000","87000"," Here we go, baby."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","89000","91000"," What's going on out there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","91000","94000"," I got some weirdness going on today, I don't know what that is."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","94000","97000"," I think that's some light over there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","97000","100000"," Uh, implications on multiple timeframes."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","100000","103000"," And, uh, sometimes I can become confusing for some people."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","103000","107000"," Uh, so we, we don't discuss that this morning as well."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","107000","110000"," And, uh, what those implications are, stuff like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","110000","115000"," Uh, it was, it was cool because CPA, CPI did been hot today, which I wanted it to."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","115000","117000"," But you don't want it to be too hot, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","117000","118000"," No, it's crazy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","118000","121000"," If you're a bull, you want a hot CPI right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","121000","122000"," Remember last quarter?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","122000","125000"," We had really cool unemployment numbers, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","125000","128000"," And they, then they came back and revised them, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","128000","136000"," There's a, there's a part of, there's a part of, uh, the market where you, right now, you, you kind of want this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","136000","138000"," Let me make it, let me simplify it for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","138000","142000"," You kind of want like this, if this was inflation here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","142000","144000"," We're coming down to inflation, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","144000","146000"," You don't want the velocity inflation."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","146000","151000"," You don't want like inflation, like slam down into 2% and then slam back up like that, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","151000","154000"," So the Fed's like right here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","154000","159000"," And the longer that they fucking make this thing go like this, the better off they are."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","159000","161000"," And the better off you are as a bull."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","161000","163000"," Does that make sense?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","163000","167000"," Um, so you want like hot week, or a hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, cold."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","167000","168000"," Best, best I can do it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","168000","170000"," Even if it's a slow sweep down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","170000","171000"," You know what I'm saying?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","171000","172000"," You don't want this velocity."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","172000","174000"," You want this velocity to the upside either."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","175000","178000"," People will see me post stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","178000","181000"," And they don't have the full context of my posts."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","181000","183000"," They're not watching the live stream."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","183000","184000"," They're not in a discord."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","184000","185000"," They're not getting a newsletter."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","185000","186000"," They're not getting it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","186000","188000"," Like you need the whole entire goddamn thing."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","188000","189000"," And then you get it all."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","189000","190000"," You're like, I get all that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","190000","192000"," I know what he's saying."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","192000","195000"," So sometimes my posts on Ben Twitt can seem like they're one thing"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","195000","199000"," or I'm talking out of the side of my mouth or I'm shit posting when I'm not at all."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","199000","201000"," In any way, shape or form."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","202000","208000"," Then it's fascinating too because this morning I'm going to ask the question about CPI specifically."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","208000","213000"," And what's fascinating about it is there's a large group of investors and traders."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","213000","214000"," Bull's bears."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","214000","215000"," I don't care a lot."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","215000","221000"," There's a large percentage out there that specifically it's how about a CPI, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","221000","226000"," If CPI starts to, or if inflation starts to spike down really fast and aggressively,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","226000","231000"," spikes up really fast and aggressively, let's say you see in the stock market in the"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","231000","234000"," intraday, like some, we're moving up higher and higher and higher."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","234000","236000"," Then you start seeing the market squeeze, iron, iron, iron."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","236000","239000"," Everyone's like, fuck yeah, woo, bullish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","239000","241000"," The truth is not bullish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","241000","243000"," It's very bearish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","243000","246000"," And so I wouldn't even be trying to trade that I'd be sitting there looking to grab"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","246000","248000"," something to fucking sell the fuck out of this market."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","248000","250000"," You know, and the same in the inverse here too."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","250000","253000"," So this hot CPR report is bearish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","253000","257000"," In the short term, but very bullish in the long term."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","257000","261000"," In a matter of fact, the week, I think this past week I was talking to you guys, people"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","261000","265000"," were asking me in the stream, what about those seven cuts expected this year?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","265000","267000"," And what did I tell you guys?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","267000","270000"," I said, that's pure fucking gambling."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","270000","271000"," It's not real."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","271000","272000"," It's fake."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","272000","278000"," You know, you have mortgage companies that'll drop rates right on these expected cuts when"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","278000","280000"," they're writing mortgages and stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","280000","281000"," That's real."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","281000","284000"," Somebody out there is getting a lower rate in their mortgage."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","284000","288000"," But the betting on the real cuts is fucking pure gambling."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","288000","290000"," It's pure speculation."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","290000","294000"," And then you hear, I heard, well, I heard the bond market's always right, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","294000","297000"," The bond market is smarter than the cash market."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","297000","300000"," But the fucking bond market right now is begging."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","300000","304000"," They're own, they're begging right now for those rate cuts."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","304000","306000"," They need those rate cuts."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","306000","310000"," You're going to hear the bond guys tell you and bet on rate cuts."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","310000","313000"," This year, they fucking need it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","313000","318000"," Of course, they're going to price in and bet that we're going to get rate cuts that they"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","318000","319000"," fucking need it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","319000","321000"," They're going to get paid."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","321000","324000"," Cause that's three right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","324000","326000"," A couple of things of note here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","326000","328000"," If you are a seller."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","328000","331000"," So I took the money and ran."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","331000","333000"," I had a note right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","333000","334000"," Nope."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","334000","335000"," Right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","335000","336000"," That one right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","337000","340000"," I sold some, I had some puts I owned right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","340000","341000"," Got out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","341000","344000"," I should have taken some more right there, but didn't."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","344000","346000"," I was trying to get the fucking stream up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","346000","348000"," A couple of notes here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","348000","349000"," Just so you know."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","349000","350000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","350000","354000"," See that white line right there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","354000","355000"," How vertical it is?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","355000","357000"," That's pretty fucking bearish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","357000","359000"," And that white line side is flattening out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","359000","361000"," We start to turn a corner to go to the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","361000","363000"," So right now still still super bearish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","363000","364000"," Five minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","364000","365000"," Same thing."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","366000","367000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","367000","369000"," So come in here and check the one minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","369000","370000"," Check the one minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","370000","371000"," Come back."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","371000","372000"," Check the one minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","372000","373000"," You guys."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","373000","375000"," Same thing on the flip side on the upside for bulls."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","375000","377000"," We should keep selling that one minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","377000","381000"," Now if we do a double or back check to the five minute, it holds."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","381000","383000"," We will continue down as well."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","383000","387000"," So if you're a bear, you could like, you know, take a, take an order right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","387000","389000"," DCA right there stops above."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","389000","394000"," You already know that if price breaks above, you get the hourly trigger on your side and"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","394000","396000"," the half hour trigger and your side up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","396000","401000"," And even if we squeeze up here, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be taking the short off unless"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","401000","403000"," you're like the pullback down here, that kind of stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","403000","406000"," So on the entry day, still kind of bearish right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","406000","409000"," Red S2 right now target to the downside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","409000","417000"," For me at least is going to be at least somewhere around this S3 possibly even 469, 67, something"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","417000","418000"," like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","418000","422000"," Let's also look at really quick."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","422000","426000"," We're going to Tesla about 30 minute chart."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","426000","427000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","427000","430000"," Let's take a look at spoons really quick."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","430000","431000"," Right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","431000","433000"," I think this is a B wave."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","433000","434000"," I could be wrong on that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","434000","438000"," But don't, don't, don't quote me as an Elliott wave expert and stuff like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","438000","440000"," But this was a B wave."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","440000","443000"," I think one, two, and three."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","443000","444000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","444000","446000"," One, two, and three."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","446000","448000"," And that's your real move to the upside right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","448000","449000"," No, saying that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","449000","454000"," And that's, and that's saying that because you've got this nice roll is probably a bunch of"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","454000","455000"," Elliott waivers out there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","455000","456000"," Like fuck."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","456000","457000"," Yeah."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","457000","459000"," Maybe we'll come right back down and go down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","459000","461000"," There's some stuff to talk about here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","461000","462000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","462000","464000"," Now, there's a warning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","464000","466000"," I got a warning for you here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","466000","467000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","467000","472000"," There is a, where is it at?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","472000","473000"," 4730."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","473000","475000"," Say or something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","475000","476000"," 4740."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","476000","478000"," So we're right on the game of flip right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","478000","484000"," If you were in the game of flip right now, but this thing has been, this box has been."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","484000","487000"," Call this box right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","487000","489000"," Pretend this is CTA's."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","489000","490000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","490000","491000"," They were down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","491000","492000"," Then they were down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","492000","493000"," Then they were down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","493000","494000"," Now they're right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","494000","499000"," They're actually currently right here where they will become net sellers of the market."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","499000","500000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","500000","503000"," So we don't want to see that happen."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","503000","505000"," We don't want to see price."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","506000","508000"," Start this journey."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","508000","509000"," Down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","509000","510000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","510000","512000"," This can lead to a pretty significant downside move."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","512000","515000"," So we're going to be interested in this holding here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","515000","518000"," I don't mind this right here to make that move higher."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","518000","522000"," Like I like that still for the bulls, but if we start to confirm this role here,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","522000","525000"," I would expect some major downside moves."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","525000","530000"," Not, um, not for 6743."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","530000","532000"," The mechanics here, we're like this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","533000","538000"," The CTA's were down here earlier in time, like back here in time they were."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","538000","543000"," So if we had come up here and rolled down, I was pretty confident we're going to roll up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","543000","546000"," Start a nice fucking huge move to the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","546000","550000"," Now as time has passed, these CTA's have gotten higher and higher and higher and higher."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","550000","555000"," Uh, so there's a chance of greater risk here not of this not holding."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","555000","561000"," If it doesn't, if we roll down here and reject right here, like a major rejection right here,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","561000","563000"," I don't see this as being bottom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","563000","570000"," I would see be looking for a target of a corrective target down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","570000","574000"," Okay, which is, uh, actually down there right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","574000","579000"," Uh, roughly 450 right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","579000","585000"," Uh, if this, if this begins to, if this begins, hold on a second here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","586000","589000"," If this begins to break right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","589000","594000"," And if you see this, so if you see like the break and you see the rejection,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","594000","596000"," I'm not going to expect that bounce there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","596000","602000"," I'm going to expect us to go all the way down and, and, uh, have a V shape recovery down here at some point at a 450."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","602000","605000"," So if you are a bear, you are looking for a break."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","605000","607000"," I'm going to show you that break right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","607000","608000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","608000","610000"," And we're going to put this back on a one minute chart here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","610000","611000"," So just be aware of that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","611000","612000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","613000","616000"," Now we can break this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","616000","617000"," We can break this here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","617000","620000"," We can break this here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","620000","623000"," But if we V shape recovery come back up, we're good to go."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","623000","625000"," Everything is awesome sauce."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","625000","626000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","626000","628000"," You need the, if you're a bear, you need."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","628000","631000"," If you're a bear, you don't want to see that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","631000","634000"," If you're a bear, you want to see the break."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","634000","635000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","635000","637000"," And then you want to see the rejection, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","637000","641000"," You want to see that action right there either right here or up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","642000","643000"," That move to the downside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","643000","645000"," So we'll, we'll monitor it and see what happens."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","645000","647000"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","647000","654000"," Now that correction is not, um, the doom and gloom that, uh, now I'm perfect from the"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","654000","655000"," Twitter this morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","655000","662000"," That, that glue, doom and gloom is not, uh, that corrective behavior is not the inflation"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","662000","665000"," bounce the, the, uh, cut and rates that they're looking for."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","665000","670000"," These, there are sellers and bears out there, uh, that want to see inflation"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","670000","672000"," slam down on 2% slam up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","672000","676000"," They want to see a ramp of velocity ramp on unemployment."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","676000","678000"," And they want to see rate cut start."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","678000","682000"," And then, and then they want to get, that's to get that 30% down move they're looking"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","682000","683000"," for."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","683000","686000"," So outside of corrective behavior, stuff like that, situation is normal."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","686000","689000"," Uh, now be aware of this chart right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","689000","692000"," I'm going to bring this back up in a smaller window later, but I want you to pay attention"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","692000","693000"," to this chart right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","693000","694000"," Here's the gamma flip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","694000","695000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","695000","697000"," It's not good enough."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","697000","700000"," Slamming below it and then coming back up, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","700000","702000"," And holding this shit and then heading higher, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","702000","704000"," There's your V shape recovery."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","704000","709000"," If you're a bear, you want to see, uh, blood underneath the gamma flip and then rejection"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","709000","711000"," of the gamma flip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","711000","714000"," Come down and beat this prior low right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","714000","718000"," If you see this action right here, they're fucking selling."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","718000","719000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","719000","721000"," And I mean, in a big way, institutional selling."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","721000","724000"," That's, this is what institutional selling will look like."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","724000","727000"," This is not institutional selling at this point."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","727000","731000"," Um, but this would be an indicator of institutional selling down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","731000","733000"," This is SPX, by the way."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","733000","736000"," You can snap that or just take a picture or whatever if you want on this stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","736000","738000"," Uh, we're sitting in the gamma flip right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","738000","742000"," This is where a bull would buy the dip, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","742000","745000"," So if this is where a bull would buy the dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","745000","749000"," I'm looking for what this right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","749000","751000"," To make an entry."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","751000","752000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","752000","755000"," So watch this right here to this price action right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","755000","757000"," So I'm going to be looking for."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","757000","762000"," As a bull to buy a dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","762000","764000"," I know about the pit above at 4800."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","764000","766000"," I hope I might not get it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","766000","768000"," I might get a reversible before that happens."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","768000","770000"," If that happens, it'd be like this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","770000","773000"," You'd see that come down that come down that flip up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","773000","774000"," Yeah."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","774000","776000"," I'll be a buyer right there if it turns right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","776000","780000"," But otherwise I'm looking for some kind of like blood bath here and a V shape that some"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","780000","785000"," point in that early trigger to come down and I'll enter the market long again and target"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","785000","786000"," 4800."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","786000","787000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","787000","790000"," Um, so right now to be cool, relax, chill out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","790000","791000"," If you're a bull, just chill out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","791000","792000"," Relax."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","792000","793000"," Hang out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","793000","796000"," Uh, if you're a seller or a bear and you think there's more down to come, I'm with you on"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","796000","797000"," that right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","797000","799000"," So there's more downside to come."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","799000","800000"," Now saying all that, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","800000","802000"," Going through all that stuff right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","802000","804000"," Um, that cool."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","804000","809000"," Those questions this morning are the questions this morning, at least from my perspective,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","810000","813000"," I'm hoping for a hot CPI this morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","813000","814000"," I'm hoping for it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","814000","818000"," I want a hot CPI and then I want like a cool CPI."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","818000","820000"," I want, I want it to go like this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","820000","821000"," Sideways."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","821000","823000"," I want it to like chill the fuck out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","823000","825000"," I don't want any velocity to the downside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","825000","829000"," Um, and I actually don't mind, uh, velocity of the upside inflation as long as I don't"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","829000","830000"," get 2%."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","830000","832000"," Um, and I really liked hearing this more."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","832000","834000"," I loved watching this morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","834000","838000"," Uh, CNBC is like, CNBC bond guy, all kinds of people out there going fuck or, or we're"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","838000","840000"," not getting a fucking rate cut."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","840000","844000"," And you got some people out there going, uh, you got some people out there going, yeah,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","844000","845000"," for the wrong and right reasons."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","845000","849000"," And some people going, uh, uh, no for the wrong and right reasons."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","849000","855000"," So within the crowd that says, yeah, you're like looking for, I'm looking for who's saying"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","855000","857000"," yeah right now, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","857000","859000"," Who's saying now right now?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","859000","861000"," Then I'm gonna tell you something."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","861000","864000"," If you, if you're a bear, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","865000","868000"," And you want to find out who the smart bears are?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","868000","870000"," Those are the guys that were pissed off."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","870000","873000"," That's, that, that inflation didn't come in cool this morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","873000","875000"," If it, I used to be a bear."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","875000","877000"," If I was a bear, I wanted cool inflation today."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","877000","879000"," A hundred fucking percent."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","879000","884000"," Cause I know great cuts are coming and I know I can take a giant fucking short position"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","884000","885000"," in this market."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","885000","887000"," Giant for huge move down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","887000","890000"," So, uh, think about that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","890000","894000"," The reactions that you saw from, uh, different people this morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","894000","898000"," You want to pay attention to, uh, those reactions."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","898000","901000"," The bulls that were like, yeah, hot CPI, I like it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","901000","902000"," Follow those bulls."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","902000","903000"," Guarantee it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","903000","904000"," Follows bulls."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","904000","905000"," Guys are making money."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","905000","906000"," Hand over fucking fist."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","906000","911000"," Uh, if you're following bears out there, uh, the bears that really want bears that know"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","911000","916000"," they want, uh, cool inflation and they want a lot of it really fast and they want multiple"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","916000","917000"," months of it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","918000","919000"," They start seeing that cool inflation."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","919000","920000"," They already know it's coming."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","920000","921000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","921000","922000"," All right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","922000","923000"," So pass all that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","923000","924000"," Right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","924000","925000"," There's your target."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","925000","926000"," I'm going to give you a target right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","926000","927000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","927000","928000"," I'll even draw it out for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","928000","930000"," What I want to see happen here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","930000","931000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","931000","933000"," I want to see something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","933000","937000"," Then I want to see some big old squeeze right there for that 30 minute half hour cross."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","937000","939000"," I want to see some kind of bloodbath right down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","939000","940000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","940000","942000"," And there's your V shape recovery."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","942000","943000"," Something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","943000","944000"," The upside right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","944000","945000"," Something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","946000","947000"," There you go."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","947000","948000"," Maybe that helps."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","948000","949000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","949000","950000"," Boom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","950000","951000"," Right down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","951000","952000"," Get the cross coming up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","952000","953000"," If you are a bull."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","953000","954000"," If you are a bear."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","954000","955000"," Uh, or a bull doesn't matter."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","955000","956000"," It doesn't matter."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","956000","957000"," It doesn't matter."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","957000","958000"," It's upside or down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","958000","963000"," But whenever you said it starts to see these crosses like this, this will, this, uh, half"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","963000","967000"," hour crossing this hourly will, will tend to add some fucking velocity to the downside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","967000","968000"," So we'll see how this happens."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","969000","970000"," Play the wash house."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","970000","971000"," Put me this helps you guys out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","971000","972000"," I guess I don't know."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","972000","973000"," Maybe it does."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","973000","974000"," But maybe it doesn't."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","974000","979000"," That was my, uh, I think it was 470 98 or something."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","979000","981000"," 72 78 something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","981000","982000"," Whatever."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","982000","983000"," It's close enough."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","983000","985000"," Uh, also note that this is the gamma flip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","985000","993000"," So you want to not only break it, but you want to break it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","993000","994000"," This is the gamma flip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","994000","1000000"," So you want to not only break the gamma flip, but you want to stand underneath it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1000000","1001000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1001000","1005000"," If you're a bear, you want to get under the gamma flip and then reject it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1005000","1007000"," Give a flip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1007000","1013000"," I'll make that yellow or we'll make it red for the bears."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1013000","1016000"," Right about there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1016000","1018000"," So if you're a bear, you're looking for what?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1018000","1020000"," Look at that blood."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1020000","1021000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1022000","1023000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1023000","1024000"," Then you're looking for the rejection right down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1024000","1026000"," That's what you're looking for right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1026000","1029000"," Something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1029000","1034000"," But right now when we're at the gamma flip, this is still a dip by the dip scenario."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1034000","1039000"," Uh, we want to you as a seller, you want to flip this to a celerif scenario."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1039000","1047000"," So right now we're still right now we're still technically at a by the dip on the gamma flip scenario."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1047000","1048000"," Make sense?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1049000","1057000"," If we flip this, we'll turn to sellers and we'll start selling this market, uh, in, in, uh, with some power."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1057000","1058000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1058000","1059000"," So we're done with all that stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1059000","1060000"," Morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1060000","1061000"," Everybody."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1061000","1062000"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1062000","1064000"," We're going to talk Tesla right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1064000","1065000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1065000","1066000"," This is a good time talking about Tesla, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1066000","1067000"," Cause we're on the bottom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1067000","1069000"," We're going to talk Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1069000","1072000"," Now I'm going to make some statements to you that might piss you off."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1072000","1074000"," Uh, you can actually search."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1074000","1077000"," So I'm not going to, I was going to prep for this, but I'm not going to cause I've already done this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1077000","1080000"," I've already shown this before, then all the hard work and all that stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1080000","1081000"," You can find it on your own."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1081000","1083000"," Uh, now Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1083000","1090000"," You know how you hear things like, now you hear things, um, you know, you hear things."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1090000","1092000"," I mean, where's my camera up here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1092000","1093000"," Yeah, show my pretty face, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1093000","1099000"," You know, you hear, you hear stuff from, um, you'll hear things like, uh, Tesla's no longer the most"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1099000","1101000"," shorted stock in the world."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1101000","1104000"," One of the things about Tesla that really sucks."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1104000","1106000"," Sorry, I got a light back there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1106000","1113000"," Uh, blue light that kicked off a, uh, count or a desk back there for my cat."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1113000","1119000"," Tesla, what sucks about Tesla is, uh, a lot of hedge funds will go into."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1119000","1124000"," Small ETFs with a low volume, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1124000","1126000"," And they will short."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1126000","1128000"," These smaller ETFs."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1128000","1133000"," Uh, it's easier to short these smaller ETFs that have Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1133000","1135000"," As a major component."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1135000","1137000"," A major holding of that ETF."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1137000","1141000"," It's an easier way for them to get, uh, amplified impact."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1141000","1145000"," And, uh, make the price of Tesla go down in a meaningful way."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1145000","1147000"," So I want to be, you'll be aware of that, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1147000","1149000"," Uh, it's an important thing."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1149000","1151000"," Uh, there are a lot of hedge funds."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1151000","1153000"," There's a, there's a great, uh, I don't have it in front of me."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1153000","1157000"," That's what I mean by this is that I used to post a video from my, um."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1157000","1161000"," From, I think it was a C span, uh, discussion at a university, one of the big universities."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1161000","1167000"," Yell or Princeton or something where, uh, they were discussing this going on quietly behind the scenes."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1167000","1171000"," So even though you might see this is not the most shorted stock or maybe sometimes it is or isn't,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1171000","1173000"," I want you to know that there's active shorting of Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1173000","1177000"," And last year, of course, you know that, uh, shorts lost a ton of money last year shorting Tesla,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1177000","1179000"," but they are actively shorting it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1179000","1185000"," Not directly on Tesla or through or like inside of the big indexes."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1185000","1189000"," They're doing it where they can actually manipulate the price of Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1189000","1192000"," Where it doesn't track the rest of the market at times."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1192000","1196000"," The other issue with Tesla is it's a major holding in small caps."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1196000","1198000"," Now small caps."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1198000","1203000"," You saw it getting front run on the anticipation of rate cuts coming, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1203000","1207000"," You've got the bond market saying we're getting seven rate cuts in the."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1207000","1208000"," 2024."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1208000","1214000"," And you see the ramp going on for outsized and outsized move in IWM."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1214000","1215000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1215000","1219000"," On anticipated rate cuts in 2024."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1219000","1223000"," As long as those anticipated rate cuts are still valid."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1223000","1227000"," You would still see IWM crank."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1227000","1230000"," Until those rate cuts begin."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1230000","1234000"," So if they have anticipating seven rate cuts sometime in spring,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1234000","1237000"," you're going to expect an outperformance by IWM."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1237000","1240000"," And guess what I do holds a lot of Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1241000","1246000"," So you've got this like double amplification of downside moves and Tesla going on."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1246000","1249000"," Tesla's not participating with the rest of the market."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1249000","1251000"," Now it's not your news that you're listening to."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1251000","1252000"," It's not the shit that you're consuming."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1252000","1254000"," It's not the diarrhea that you're eating."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1254000","1255000"," It's not anything you're hearing."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1255000","1258000"," Now you might see some news come out with this though."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1258000","1259000"," Bad news."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1259000","1263000"," And bad news is timed by companies like Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1263000","1267000"," Every company out there kind of knows when that when that downside moves coming."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1267000","1271000"," And they will choose to divulge bad news in those periods as well."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1271000","1272000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1272000","1275000"," This is not rocket science stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1275000","1279000"," So if you have a down move in any company and you've got some dirty laundry,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1279000","1282000"," you're going to empty that dirty laundry when you're in a down fucking move."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1282000","1284000"," Does that make sense to you?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1284000","1285000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1285000","1287000"," I'm a company and I'm publicly traded."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1287000","1289000"," I'm going to wait for the right time to disclose certain news."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1289000","1290000"," Makes sense."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1290000","1294000"," I'm going to wait for it when my stock is screaming higher."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1294000","1296000"," What am I going to do?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1296000","1299000"," As it's going to the moon, I'm going to come out with some kick ass news."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1299000","1303000"," Get that last little bit out of that stock, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1303000","1305000"," Just be aware of that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1305000","1307000"," So then I was going to post that this morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1307000","1313000"," Like expect some some real nasty news or there might be some nasty news coming out from Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1313000","1317000"," If this happens, we're going to talk about what could possibly happen with Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1317000","1322000"," And if it does happen with Tesla, you're likely going to see Elon air some dirty laundry."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1323000","1324000"," I would."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1324000","1325000"," I fucking would."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1325000","1326000"," But I was the line."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1326000","1328000"," I'd be like, fuck yeah, if we're going to go down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1328000","1330000"," What do we got for bad news?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1330000","1334000"," Does that make sense to you?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1334000","1337000"," You show me the price and I'll tell you what the news is."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1337000","1339000"," Does that make sense?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1339000","1340000"," That's right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1340000","1341000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1341000","1343000"," So we're going to talk Tesla air."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1343000","1346000"," And I was making some statements here earlier about."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1346000","1349000"," Matter of fact, I charted this for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1349000","1351000"," On live stream."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1351000","1353000"," On live stream."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1353000","1354000"," I charted that for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1354000","1356000"," Where are we?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1356000","1360000"," Even reviewed it again on Tuesday, I think."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1360000","1361000"," And where are we?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1361000","1364000"," Where I said we'd be, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1364000","1365000"," Told you we'd be right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1365000","1368000"," We're there right now, aren't we?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1368000","1369000"," So there you go."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1369000","1371000"," That's what charted it for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1371000","1373000"," Revisited it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1373000","1375000"," And where are we today?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1375000","1376000"," Right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1376000","1377000"," It's right there, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1377000","1379000"," I didn't fucking make this today."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1379000","1381000"," Go back and watch live streams."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1381000","1384000"," Go back and watch every fucking one of those live streams."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1384000","1385000"," Go back to you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1385000","1386000"," Some of you guys are here every day."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1386000","1387000"," Know about these live streams."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1387000","1388000"," You're here every day, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1388000","1389000"," You can vouch for this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1389000","1391000"," It's on fucking tape."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1391000","1395000"," So Tesla's down today, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1395000","1397000"," Now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1397000","1399000"," There's some stuff I got to go over with you here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1399000","1400000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1400000","1401000"," This is an important Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1401000","1402000"," We're going to do Tesla talk."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1402000","1403000"," We're going to vote."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1403000","1404000"," My time."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1404000","1405000"," Tesla today."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1406000","1407000"," People have been asking me about it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1407000","1408000"," Ask me about it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1408000","1409000"," Ask me about it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1409000","1413000"," We got people coming in the stream saying people that I trust coming in the stream."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1413000","1416000"," Last time we talked Tesla this earlier this past week and it was Monday."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1416000","1418000"," They said, Hey, cap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1418000","1423000"," My friends are fucking getting really concerned about Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1423000","1424000"," You got any good news?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1424000","1425000"," I'm like, fuck."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1425000","1426000"," No, I don't."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1426000","1427000"," I got no good news for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1427000","1430000"," Now, there is a lead at the end of the tunnel on this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1430000","1431000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1431000","1433000"," There's a couple of things here you got to watch here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1433000","1434000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1435000","1438000"," If there is a cross, you guys get pencils out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1438000","1439000"," Snap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1439000","1440000"," How about this?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1440000","1442000"," We'll start here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1442000","1446000"," When they're in snap picture that matter if I'm just getting rid of my camera over here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1446000","1447000"," I'm going to move."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1447000","1449000"," I ain't getting rid of my camera."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1449000","1451000"," Hold on here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1451000","1454000"," They're out of your fucking minds."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1454000","1458000"," Leave my pretty at my ugly ass up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1458000","1460000"," Put me down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1460000","1461000"," How about that?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1461000","1462000"," Oh, my webcam frame."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1462000","1463000"," Well, that's even sexy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1463000","1464000"," It's all fucked up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1464000","1465000"," They'll look at it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1465000","1467000"," You guys can't repose this anywhere."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1467000","1470000"," You'll be like, this guy is swearing, telling people he's pretty."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1470000","1471000"," Look at it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1471000","1473000"," So here we go."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1473000","1475000"," A little snap of this for yourselves."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1475000","1478000"," Take a little screenshot of whatever."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1478000","1482000"," And we're going to look at some prior history stuff here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1482000","1486000"," And we're going to talk about the price of Tesla and so on."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1486000","1487000"," What to expect here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1487000","1489000"," You're getting a cross right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1489000","1491000"," The daily trigger over the weekly trigger."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1491000","1494000"," You've got price testing the monthly trigger."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1494000","1499000"," The monthly trigger, as long as Tesla stays above it, it's bullish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1499000","1505000"," Price above the monthly trigger means Tesla, any stock, is in a bullish context."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1505000","1511000"," If the price of any stock goes below and rejects and begins to head lower of the monthly trigger,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1511000","1513000"," it is extremely bearish for that ticker."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1513000","1518000"," That includes Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1518000","1526000"," Another problem here is that you have the daily trigger of this yellow line crossing right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1526000","1532000"," When this cross is made down here, you're likely going to see a squeeze to the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1532000","1535000"," Not guaranteed, but a high probability of it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1535000","1537000"," I've actually a squeeze up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1537000","1540000"," Regardless of what this low is right here, you'll see a squeeze."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1540000","1544000"," And it'll be confirming that downside move."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1544000","1549000"," There's another problem here, too, where if it consolidates for a little bit,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1549000","1552000"," and that daily trigger comes down to this monthly,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1552000","1556000"," and it happens there, it can be very, very detrimental."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1556000","1559000"," You then come up with like a six or eight trigger cluster that's bearish."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1559000","1564000"," And if it confirms this downside move, it's going to be a fucking bloodbath."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1564000","1568000"," And that bloodbath will likely coincide with some kind of news breaking about Tesla"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1568000","1572000"," or some kind of market news that's unknown right now to us."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1572000","1574000"," They probably already know it, we just don't know it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1574000","1578000"," So if this play is out right here, my point here is that this play is out, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1578000","1579000"," It's going to be fucking ugly."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1579000","1581000"," I'm going to warn you of this right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1581000","1585000"," So if you own the underlying in Tesla, you have to start to consider it at some points,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1585000","1589000"," putting some kind of a cheap put hedge on or something,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1589000","1592000"," or just diamond-handed know that it's going to go down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1592000","1595000"," I would not sell if you're already upside down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1595000","1596000"," I would not be our seller here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1596000","1598000"," I would be in some protection mode."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1598000","1603000"," And the reason I'm saying that is because after this, if this move happens to the downside,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1603000","1606000"," the move after it is going to be explosive to the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1606000","1608000"," And you'll be fine again, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1608000","1609000"," No more, you want to worry again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1609000","1615000"," You set the picture of your muffs on and not listen to the general public hockey and stuff like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1615000","1619000"," So there is a setup here, a very bearish setup here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1619000","1625000"," Now, if at any point the deli velocity gets to minus 50, let's say we're down here,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1625000","1629000"," there's also high probability that we come up here, break above the deli trigger,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1629000","1632000"," confirm it, and just be out of here and we're off and running again, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1632000","1635000"," So if that happens, like this, I'll update you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1635000","1642000"," But for right now, where we are, there is an extremely bearish setup happening."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1642000","1646000"," So I've charted all that out for you as of right now, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1646000","1650000"," We're going to take a look at what to expect down here, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1650000","1652000"," And we're going to chart that out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1652000","1657000"," But for right now, for where we are, thesis-wise, there's going to be a squeeze here at some point,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1657000","1662000"," and a confirmation for some pretty major lows down here, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1662000","1666000"," This one right here, you're going to check, and you're also likely going to check this one right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1666000","1668000"," And we'll put these down here for you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1671000","1672000"," Right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1673000","1675000"," We're going to make that one yellow."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1675000","1677000"," And we're going to talk velocity here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1677000","1679000"," I got more to talk to you guys about here, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1679000","1681000"," A whole bunch of important stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1683000","1685000"," Something like that right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1685000","1687000"," And if that happens, you know what the rest of it is, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1687000","1690000"," The rest of it's going to be creating straight down to the depths of the pellet."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1690000","1691000"," It's going to come up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1691000","1693000"," And then it's going to come right back down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1693000","1696000"," And attack that one, come up here, start to consolidate likely a little bit."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1696000","1699000"," And then you're going to get some real vicious downside moves."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1699000","1701000"," They're going to get nasty."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1702000","1704000"," More than likely."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1704000","1706000"," I'm going to explain to you why here in a minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1707000","1712000"," You can't have demand down here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1712000","1713000"," And fail right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1713000","1719000"," If you do fail right there, that means that they're going to want to check down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1719000","1723000"," And this is going to close one of your first big gaps way back in 2020."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1723000","1726000"," That's a price target of $77.93 right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1726000","1730000"," This is a six month Elliott wave for lack of a better word term."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1730000","1733000"," And you'll likely see that gap get closed down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1733000","1738000"," Now, if you do see that happen, you're likely going to see huge demand come in again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1738000","1742000"," And you'll likely see another move to the upside, a major move to the upside actually."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1742000","1744000"," Take out something like that up there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1744000","1745000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1745000","1747000"," So, oh, sorry about that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1751000","1754000"," So if you are already upside down or fucked or whatever, you just hang tight."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1754000","1755000"," Head yourself."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1755000","1761000"," If that on that coming back up here, DCA down here, DCA down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1761000","1763000"," So you're a happy bull."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1763000","1765000"," Conversation from earlier."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1765000","1767000"," I'm a happy bull."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1767000","1769000"," You're always like, yes, fuck an awesome appearance."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1769000","1770000"," I love being this guy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1770000","1771000"," Woohoo, everything's awesome."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1771000","1772000"," A plus plus."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1772000","1773000"," I got an A."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1773000","1774000"," I'm a good student, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1774000","1777000"," So this is setting up right now for Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1777000","1783000"," If rate cuts aren't coming, those shorts that I talked about with you in the smaller indexes,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1783000","1784000"," not not IWM."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1784000","1786000"," I mean smaller, like tiny ones."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1787000","1791000"," IWM not outperforming on the anticipation of rate cuts."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1791000","1792000"," That kind of stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1792000","1797000"," You could see this, this amplification here for a downside move for Tesla down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1797000","1798000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1798000","1799000"," Price target."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1799000","1800000"," It's not $77."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1800000","1803000"," It's about, I think it's 80 or, you know, it's $89."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1803000","1806000"," I believe by the time we get there, it's like $89 or something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1806000","1808000"," But we slammed through the 89 bucks close that gap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1808000","1810000"," Even on the gap, I think it's 66."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1810000","1813000"," Don't quote me in the exact numbers here because I haven't looked at it in detail."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1814000","1815000"," I should have prepared, but I didn't."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1815000","1818000"," But I remember it and recall it from back when there's a gap, I believe in 89."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1818000","1820000"," And I think there's a gap at 66."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1820000","1822000"," Correct me in the chat if I'm wrong on that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1822000","1824000"," 64, 66, something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1824000","1828000"," I would expect that night that $89 gap to get closed would go up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1828000","1832000"," And then I would expect another trip down to that $60 at some point."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1832000","1835000"," Whatever that is, I don't know in time, time wise, but I would expect, I expect that we're"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1835000","1840000"," going to close that gap and go back and close that $64 gap year down the road or whatever."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1840000","1842000"," Two years down the road or something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1842000","1844000"," It's 26, 20, 28."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1844000","1846000"," Now this can resolve itself to the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1846000","1848000"," I showed you that already, but I want to talk to you guys specifically."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1848000","1850000"," Matter of fact, you can actually see this right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1850000","1851000"," Something similar to this right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1851000","1852000"," See that move down?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1852000","1853000"," Bloodbath, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1853000","1854000"," Whoom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1854000","1855000"," Another bloodbath right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1855000","1856000"," Whoom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1856000","1857000"," Remember, nobody bought that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1857000","1858000"," Did they?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1858000","1859000"," They didn't buy it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1859000","1860000"," Did they?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1860000","1861000"," I know they didn't."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1861000","1862000"," I was there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1862000","1863000"," I remember it happened."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1863000","1864000"," I was so pissed off that morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1864000","1865000"," I wanted to close the gap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1865000","1866000"," They left it behind."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1866000","1871000"," They actually left the fucking gap from back in, I believe, February or March of 2020."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1871000","1873000"," They left that fucking gap open down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1873000","1874000"," There's a gap over there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1874000","1875000"," They left it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1875000","1876000"," They literally missed it by a dollar."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1876000","1878000"," And I was pissed off that morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1878000","1880000"," I was like, I ain't fucking buying the open here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1880000","1883000"," I'm like, I want to see that gap get closed and I'm going to buy it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1883000","1884000"," It didn't close."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1884000","1885000"," It started running."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1885000","1886000"," I got all stinky."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1886000","1887000"," And then you know what I did?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1887000","1888000"," My ego was like, well, fuck them."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1888000","1890000"," I'll wait a day or two."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1890000","1892000"," Then like a day or two later, I bought that bottom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1892000","1900000"," But it was more from my own conceit, my own id, my own, you know, I want that fucking tick."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1901000","1903000"," It's not good enough that we're down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1903000","1908000"," I want the fucking, I want the penny tick to buy for my own fucking ego trip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1908000","1911000"," So I lost that in a few dollars."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1911000","1915000"," Not many, but you know, anyways."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1915000","1919000"," So there's, there is a major downside move here setting up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1919000","1920000"," Okay, as the point."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1920000","1924000"," Now, here's an example of a great run after, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1924000","1927000"," You down here at 90 bucks or whatever."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1927000","1929000"," I think it was 110 or something."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1929000","1933000"," I can't remember what the low was, but look, I don't know what it was."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1933000","1935000"," Yeah, $102."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1935000","1937000"," Great run right here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1937000","1938000"," 100 bucks."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1938000","1940000"," Got a high of $298."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1940000","1943000"," Fall that trend all the way down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1943000","1944000"," Boom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1944000","1945000"," Matter of fact, that was a set."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1945000","1946000"," You guys remember this, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1946000","1947000"," That was a seller right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1947000","1949000"," That's where I was inside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1949000","1952000"," I bought right there and sold right here fucking gorgeous run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1952000","1953000"," Made bang."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1954000","1957000"," So we have an example back here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1957000","1959000"," We have something else cool to show you here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1959000","1960000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1960000","1967000"," If we get, if we get this bull run for 2024."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1967000","1970000"," We get one last bull run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1970000","1972000"," We don't get rates cut."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1972000","1975000"," We get this like a, we get this, this moment here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1975000","1980000"," You get the soft landing a window and then the next recession,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1980000","1982000"," which is historically guaranteed."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1983000","1985000"," There's some cool, all sets cool here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1985000","1987000"," And I want to bring you back to, uh,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1987000","1990000"," I want to draw your attention to two things here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1990000","1992000"," At least historically."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1995000","1997000"," You see this, uh, you see this, this daily, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1997000","1999000"," In fact, that daily is turning around on the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","1999000","2000000"," It's good to see."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2000000","2002000"," You can see a nice little squeeze up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2002000","2007000"," Now, if this does play out, do you see the, the, the daily trigger here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2007000","2009000"," The weekly in the, in the monthly, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2009000","2011000"," There's an example of it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2012000","2017000"," And, uh, it's right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2025000","2026000"," It's right in here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2026000","2027000"," This little mess right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2027000","2029000"," This is 2018."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2031000","2033000"," And I actually remember when this happened."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2033000","2034000"," This was a Labor Day, I believe."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2034000","2036000"," No, it was Labor Day weekend."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2036000","2038000"," I think this is Labor Day weekend."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2038000","2041000"," I think this is when Elon did the lemon squeeze thing."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2041000","2043000"," I think he actually went into Wall Street bets that morning."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2043000","2044000"," Truly."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2044000","2047000"," I think he was in Wall Street bets that early morning at like 4 a.m. or some shit like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2047000","2050000"," Um, Tony Stark, baby."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2050000","2052000"," And, uh, we blasted down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2052000","2054000"," We didn't have a six month, uh, Elliott wave down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2054000","2056000"," We blasted down to the actual bottom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2056000","2060000"," And the result was an epic fucking run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2061000","2062000"," Epic."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2062000","2063000"," Epic."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2063000","2064000"," Run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2064000","2065000"," Epic."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2066000","2069000"," Stuff that makes most of the people that you love on finch with."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2069000","2072000"," You guys, the people out there, the million followers, they bought that shit."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2072000","2076000"," Matter of fact, they were so, they all bought, I don't know those, those guys bought leaps"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2076000","2078000"," and they were upside down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2079000","2080000"," They came back to wall."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2080000","2083000"," They disappeared from Wall Street bets, came back into Wall Street bets."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2083000","2085000"," And they were like, I thought my shit was dead."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2085000","2088000"," They never sold their leaps and their leaps were like burning to the fucking depths of hell"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2088000","2090000"," and their leaps were like one, two year out leaps."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2090000","2092000"," Those fucking things printed balls."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2093000","2095000"," Overnight millionaires."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2096000","2103000"," So my thesis here is if we do get that sell, if this does complete and goes down here,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2103000","2108000"," and you can get some kind of move like that down there, the after effect could be this"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2108000","2111000"," fucking epic Tesla bull run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2112000","2116000"," So from my perspective as a bull, bring it on, baby."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2117000","2119000"," I hope, I hope we can get down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2119000","2120000"," You want to close that down there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2120000","2121000"," Bring it to me."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2121000","2124000"," I want that by so bad."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2124000","2126000"," Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2129000","2131000"," You know what I'm saying?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2131000","2136000"," So if this does happen here, you get that fail, you get that squeeze up, that confirmation"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2136000","2139000"," of the roll down, be prepared for it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2140000","2143000"," If you're a bull watching this program at Tesla bull right now, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2144000","2146000"," Get yourself some dry powder."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2147000","2151000"," Because you're getting another opportunity to buy a major low."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2153000","2157000"," Now, if we don't get presented with that major low and that opportunity,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2159000","2162000"," we're going to talk about where you're going to buy the dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2165000","2166000"," Let me get rid of this here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2166000","2168000"," I'm going to move this down somewhere else."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2168000","2169000"," Yeah, it's missing that, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2170000","2173000"," If we don't get that opportunity, but I want to show you this, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2173000","2174000"," Why I think that's coming."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2175000","2179000"," And I'm going to show you right now why I think that's going to slip to a 30 minute."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2179000","2181000"," No, we're going to flip to a daily chart instead."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2181000","2185000"," Can I show the, can I show the."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2188000","2190000"," Can I show the."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2193000","2194000"," Not auto mode."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2194000","2196000"," I want to show the, the velo."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2197000","2203000"," I can't do it right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2203000","2204000"," I don't know why."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2204000","2205000"," Close it down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2207000","2208000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2208000","2210000"," So I'll show you, shut down the daily velocity."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2211000","2214000"," What I want to show you here is this, this orange bar right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2214000","2216000"," This is weekly velocity."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2217000","2223000"," Do you see how right now we're starting a down move on a weekly velocity down here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2223000","2225000"," See that when we do this over here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2226000","2228000"," We got these major downside moves in Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2229000","2231000"," So that's why I'm hoping we do this down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2231000","2232000"," Get that weekly down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2232000","2233000"," Nice and sexy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2233000","2236000"," Get that monthly velocity to the downside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2236000","2237000"," Doom and gloom, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2237000","2239000"," Quarterly velocity down here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2239000","2242000"," And this actually brings up a major bull run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2242000","2247000"," When you see stuff like this on a weekly timeframe, monthly timeframe, quarterly timeframe."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2248000","2252000"," To you, it might seem bearish, but to me as a Tesla investor, long time Tesla investor,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2252000","2254000"," I'm looking for that major swing higher."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2254000","2256000"," Now, saying all that, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2258000","2261000"," If this does recover and begin to head higher, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2261000","2262000"," Yeah, who we fuck you, cap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2262000","2263000"," You're wrong."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2263000","2265000"," You're not getting your, your doom and gloom captain."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2265000","2267000"," We're just going to start going higher pair."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2267000","2268000"," Woohoo, upside down cap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2268000","2269000"," Fuck you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2269000","2270000"," I'm not a buyer."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2270000","2271000"," A hundred bucks."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2271000","2272000"," I'm a buyer."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2272000","2273000"," A pair captain."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2273000","2274000"," That's why I'm bullish here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2274000","2275000"," That's why it's going to recover captain."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2275000","2276000"," That kind of shit, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2276000","2279000"," If that does happen, if that does happen, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2280000","2282000"," What are we looking for?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2284000","2285000"," What are we looking for?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2285000","2286000"," You guys know, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2287000","2289000"," Just get rid of that line of like goofiness right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2292000","2293000"," What are we looking for?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2295000","2296000"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2296000","2299000"," I had someone say all that's all hindsight trading back here, cap."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2300000","2301000"," Like you don't know what you're talking about."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2301000","2302000"," Like fuck you're talking about."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2305000","2306000"," It's right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2307000","2308000"," It's right over here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2308000","2309000"," That's where you buy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2310000","2311000"," Where are we at right now?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2311000","2312000"," On Deli Vello."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2313000","2314000"," We're not there, are we?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2314000","2315000"," Let me show it to you again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2315000","2316000"," Let me get rid of this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2318000","2319000"," Are we there right now?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2319000","2320000"," Let me make a bigger so you can see it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2321000","2322000"," Are we there right now?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2323000","2324000"," No."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2324000","2326000"," We want Deli velocity down here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2327000","2328000"," Somewhere down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2328000","2329000"," Somewhere in here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2329000","2330000"," Somewhere in here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2330000","2331000"," Are we there right now?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2331000","2332000"," No."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2334000","2335000"," We're at minus 11."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2335000","2337000"," We need to be minus 25 or minus 50."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2338000","2339000"," Why do we need to be there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2339000","2340000"," To buy a dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2340000","2341000"," A meaningful dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2341000","2342000"," Let's look and find out."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2343000","2344000"," You want to see one?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2345000","2347000"," There's a fucking meaningful dip right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2348000","2350000"," Do you see old Captain coming out and saying,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2350000","2351000"," now we're about to turn to the upside."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2352000","2354000"," Get all the big bulls out there saying he's fucking wrong."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2355000","2356000"," No, I was right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2357000","2358000"," This one right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2359000","2360000"," Right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2360000","2362000"," Nice big dip down there by the fucking dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2362000","2363000"," What happened here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2363000","2364000"," Let's take a look and see."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2366000","2368000"," Nice meaningful fucking dip buys, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2370000","2372000"," Even if you weren't the seller after this,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2372000","2374000"," wouldn't you love to be a DCA or down there?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2375000","2376000"," Think about that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2377000","2378000"," You go out and fence when you're like,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2378000","2379000"," I bought that fucking dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2379000","2380000"," I bought that fucking dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2381000","2383000"," I'll buy this fucking dip down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2384000","2385000"," I'm always a buyer, bro."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2385000","2386000"," Yeah, you are."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2386000","2389000"," But you're always a buyer the most opportune fucking times, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2391000","2392000"," You are the badass."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2393000","2395000"," I want to create an army."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2396000","2397000"," An army, literal army."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2398000","2400000"," Of testables that bought the best fucking time."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2402000","2405000"," I give a fine fuck about testables on Fint with them in bulls for 20 years,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2406000","2407000"," 10 years, five years."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2408000","2411000"," I want an army of testables that are like,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2411000","2413000"," I bought every fucking capitulation, the bager ones."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2415000","2416000"," I bought every fucking one of them."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2417000","2419000"," I just watched my money just grow and grow and grow."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2420000","2422000"," I want you to come back in 20 years and say,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2423000","2425000"," Hey Cap, I followed you for 20 fucking years."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2426000","2427000"," You made me rich."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2428000","2429000"," I'm serious here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2431000","2432000"," It's got another one back here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2434000","2435000"," Look at that bad boy right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2439000","2440000"," Don't know when to buy the dip on Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2441000","2442000"," That's April 2023."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2444000","2445000"," Don't know when to buy the dip on Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2446000","2447000"," That's June 2023."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2450000","2451000"," Another dip to buy down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2452000","2455000"," Just buying dips, buying dips every time we're down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2456000","2461000"," This might be the best fucking tool you can ever have of when to buy Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2463000","2465000"," Now I don't give a fuck about like see right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2466000","2467000"," I don't care about that one."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2468000","2469000"," I bought this one."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2470000","2472000"," I don't care about the interest stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2473000","2474000"," I care about the major lows."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2476000","2477000"," You're testable."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2478000","2479000"," That's what you care about."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2480000","2482000"," So are we there now or not?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2482000","2483000"," Are we?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2483000","2484000"," Let me show you something else neat here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2485000","2486000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2487000","2492000"," See how you have see how you have this top here and Tesla on the daily velocity, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2493000","2496000"," Let's look at prior examples of this topping of daily velocity"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2496000","2500000"," and see how many examples there are of velocity going negative"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2500000","2502000"," briefly and then coming back up for the run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2503000","2504000"," There's none."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2505000","2506000"," Zero."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2507000","2508000"," Zero."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2510000","2512000"," Maybe you got a friend out there that's like caps wrong."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2515000","2516000"," This could pull up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2516000","2517000"," We go positive in that daily bellow, bro."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2519000","2520000"," Let's find out last time that happened."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2521000","2522000"," Right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2522000","2523000"," It's major high up here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2523000","2524000"," Major high right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2525000","2526000"," That one right there, that tick."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2527000","2528000"," Right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2528000","2529000"," Let's do the last major one right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2533000","2534000"," Did we recover?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2534000","2535000"," Fuck no, we went lower."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2536000","2539000"," What about this one up here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2540000","2541000"," This one right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2542000","2543000"," This looks like it could have done it, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2543000","2544000"," It didn't, did it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2544000","2545000"," It went lower."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2547000","2549000"," It's minus 25 velocity, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2549000","2553000"," So minus 25 velocity, minus 50 velocity are key, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2555000","2558000"," But we didn't come down here a little bit and then go big again, did we?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2558000","2560000"," We went lower and then we went lower again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2562000","2563000"," You know what I'm saying here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2564000","2565000"," There's another one right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2566000","2567000"," There's another one."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2567000","2569000"," Let's watch this one right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2571000","2572000"," This would be you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2572000","2573000"," I'm going to show you what you are."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2575000","2576000"," Right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2576000","2577000"," Right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2578000","2579000"," Pretend that's right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2580000","2581000"," We go lower."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2581000","2583000"," We go up a tiny bit and you're like, hey, Captain's wrong again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2584000","2585000"," You're like, yeah, fuck that guy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2585000","2586000"," I look at it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2586000","2587000"," Woo, everything's fucking awesome."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2587000","2588000"," Boom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2588000","2589000"," Depth of hell."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2589000","2590000"," You're fucked."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2591000","2592000"," So what is the rule?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2593000","2596000"," You're waiting for minus 25 minus 50 to DCA."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2597000","2598000"," Does that make sense?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2598000","2600000"," So we hit minus 25 on daily velocity."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2600000","2601000"," You make your first buy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2602000","2604000"," We go down to minus 50, you make your second buy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2605000","2608000"," And the probability is that you're going to minus 50 anyways."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2608000","2613000"," Only once out of every eight or ten times, are you going to get that to minus 25."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2613000","2615000"," Dip buy back and off and running again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2616000","2624000"," So if you're a Tesla bull, here's my word of advice to you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2625000","2626000"," Chill."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2627000","2628000"," Let price lead the way."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2630000","2636000"," Wait until velocity is daily velocity is down to minus 25 minus 50."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2637000","2640000"," And we will revisit Tesla as a buy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2641000","2642000"," I'm not looking."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2642000","2646000"," I am not fucking looking for this bullshit right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2646000","2648000"," Well, the moment price gets above it, bro, I'll buy it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2649000","2650000"," I'm not looking for it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2650000","2653000"," I'm looking for daily velocity to get to minus 25 minus 50."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2654000","2656000"," Without fucking fail, I win."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2657000","2659000"," Every single fucking time."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2661000","2662000"," You want to be a winner?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2663000","2664000"," Do you want to be a winner with Captain Jim James?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2665000","2666000"," That's a real question."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2666000","2667000"," No question."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2671000","2672000"," Stop listening to the news."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2673000","2674000"," Stop watching this shit on Fintuit."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2675000","2678000"," Stop reading the newspaper, dumping fucking garbage about Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2679000","2681000"," Stop reading the newspapers about the good shit about Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2682000","2684000"," Wait for that velocity to get down to minus 25 minus 50."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2685000","2688000"," We'll look for a turn series of higher lows."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2689000","2690000"," We're going to make an entry."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2690000","2693000"," We're going to take Tesla on another nice, fat run."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2693000","2695000"," And you're going to sit back there and know you bought the bottom."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2696000","2697000"," And you can exit where the fuck you want."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2697000","2698000"," Or you just hold it forever."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2699000","2701000"," And the next time it happens, we'll come back again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2702000","2703000"," We'll buy that bottom again."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2704000","2707000"," And in 20 years, you'll come back and you'll say, you made me rich."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2712000","2714000"," So right now, there's no dip buy in Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2714000","2715000"," Now, you could did your day trade this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2717000","2719000"," You want to buy yourself a squeeze or something for the cross above"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2719000","2720000"," and the daily and the weekly."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2720000","2721000"," You can do that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2721000","2722000"," You can dick around doing that stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2722000","2723000"," But this is for a Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2723000","2724000"," This is for a Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2724000","2727000"," This show right now, this segment is for a Tesla fucking investor."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2729000","2730000"," That's what it's for."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2730000","2731000"," For a real true Tesla bull."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2732000","2733000"," Real true Tesla gang."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2735000","2736000"," Buy the lows."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2737000","2738000"," Pulled for 20 years."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2740000","2741000"," That's what this is about."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2747000","2748000"," Good question."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2748000","2749000"," Is that thesis good in every other ticker?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2749000","2750000"," No."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2751000","2753000"," Tickers run differently on velocity."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2753000","2756000"," They have different velocities that they run on that you can find patterns on."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2756000","2757000"," Good question."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2757000","2758000"," No."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2758000","2761000"," And to be truthful, the index is one of the hardest ones to trade it on."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2762000","2764000"," It's very complex using it on indexes."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2765000","2769000"," They work on multi levels, multi velocity levels going all the way down"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2769000","2770000"," to fucking quarterly and shit."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2771000","2775000"," Individual tickers clear much more much clearer using this stuff on individual"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2775000","2777000"," tickers, specifically to Tesla."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2777000","2781000"," This fucker works bad ass on Tesla on daily velocity."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2781000","2783000"," It's like never fucking fail."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2784000","2787000"," Now there might be runs in between, but I'm talking about being a Tesla"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2787000","2788000"," investor."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2789000","2794000"," Or I want to buy some fucking 25 cent Tesla calls and literally watch"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2794000","2796000"," them go to 40 fucking dollars."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2797000","2799000"," Literally watch them go to fucking 40 bucks."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2799000","2803000"," So if you're that guy, that gal, that they, that them."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2804000","2808000"," Him, her, whatever you want to call yourself, stick around in this show"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2808000","2810000"," or find some friends."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2811000","2814000"," And be like, whatever that guy says, we're at minus 25 and 50 fucking"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2814000","2815000"," find me."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2819000","2820000"," That's right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2820000","2821000"," That's right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2821000","2822000"," Connect mobile."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2825000","2826000"," That's right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2826000","2827000"," And there are people here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2827000","2829000"," You can, you can find Joe Donut has this tool."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2830000","2831000"," Ask Joe Donut."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2831000","2832000"," Find him on Twitter."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2832000","2833000"," That's the ball."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2834000","2835000"," CTA's."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2835000","2836000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2836000","2837000"," They were down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2837000","2838000"," Then they were down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2838000","2839000"," Then they were down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2839000","2840000"," Now they're right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2840000","2843000"," They're actually currently right here where they will become net"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2843000","2844000"," sellers of the market."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2844000","2845000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2846000","2847000"," I bought that fucking dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2847000","2848000"," I bought that fucking dip."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2849000","2851000"," I'll buy this fucking dip down here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2852000","2853000"," I'm always a buyer, bro."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2854000","2855000"," Yeah, you are."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2855000","2857000"," But you're always a buyer at the most opportune fucking times, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2859000","2860000"," You are the bad ass."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2860000","2862000"," I want to create an army."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2863000","2864000"," An army, literal army."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2866000","2868000"," Of testables that bought the best fucking time."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2870000","2871000"," I give a fine fuck about testables."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2872000","2875000"," I've been to it for 20 years, 10 years, five years."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2876000","2877000"," I want an army."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2878000","2879000"," Of testables."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2879000","2881000"," They're like, I bought every fucking capitulation, the"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2881000","2882000"," major ones."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2883000","2884000"," I bought every fucking one of them."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2885000","2888000"," I just watched my money just grow and grow and grow."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2888000","2891000"," I want to see one right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2893000","2895000"," But the best trade here, you want to know what it is?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2895000","2896000"," It's right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2897000","2900000"," If this one comes down and holds, that's the money trade."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2901000","2902000"," That's the big money trade."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2903000","2905000"," That would be a confirmation that we're going to go back and"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2905000","2907000"," retest all this stuff up here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2909000","2911000"," And we'll trade that 480 once again and that all time hot."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2913000","2914000"," It's hang tight right now."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2915000","2917000"," If you're a seller here or want to be a seller instead of a buyer,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2918000","2919000"," what are you looking for?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2919000","2920000"," Do you know?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2926000","2928000"," You're looking for a little bit of rejection right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2929000","2930000"," Beat that previous low."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2931000","2932000"," Are you taking that trade?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2932000","2933000"," Fuck no."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2937000","2939000"," You're waiting to see if the bulls fail to buy there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2939000","2941000"," If they do, fail to buy."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2942000","2944000"," Slam the buy button on some puts."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2944000","2945000"," Right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2945000","2946000"," It goes straight down to the depths of hell."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2949000","2950000"," Blissowitz."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2950000","2951000"," What's up, brother?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2951000","2952000"," Shaq."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2952000","2953000"," Isn't the house today good to see you?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2953000","2954000"," Blissowitz with the donation."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2954000","2955000"," I didn't see that earlier."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2955000","2956000"," Thank you, Blissowitz."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2958000","2959000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2959000","2960000"," It's a great example right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2960000","2961000"," Fucking great example."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2962000","2963000"," So."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2964000","2965000"," Market's going to roll."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2965000","2967000"," I was told by expectation going to roll."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2967000","2968000"," Didn't, didn't right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2968000","2969000"," Held the hourly trigger, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2970000","2971000"," It told me it's going to roll."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2971000","2972000"," Held the hourly trigger, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2972000","2973000"," Did you have gotten short here and here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2973000","2974000"," No."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2974000","2975000"," Maybe intraday stuff, but no, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2976000","2977000"," So how do you know?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2981000","2982000"," You break the hourly trigger."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2984000","2985000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2985000","2986000"," And you break your prior low."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2986000","2987000"," Right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2987000","2988000"," One minute remaining."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2988000","2989000"," And that's your fucking trade."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2990000","2991000"," Right."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2991000","2992000"," And you're going to forget these lines."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2992000","2993000"," This is for lines for today."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2993000","2994000"," This isn't backwards lines."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2994000","2995000"," These are for today."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2995000","2996000"," These lines."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2996000","2997000"," This stuff wouldn't have been here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2997000","2998000"," But."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","2999000","3000000"," Pulled up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3000000","3002000"," Selling again on that hourly trigger, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3002000","3003000"," Down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3003000","3004000"," You can even miss this move."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3005000","3006000"," And just take this one right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3006000","3008000"," You're in the same fucking place, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3008000","3010000"," We wait for the first drop and even get in over here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3010000","3011000"," And then that's where you take trade."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3012000","3013000"," We don't have that yet, Dewey."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3014000","3015000"," So right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3019000","3020000"," We don't have that Dewey."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3020000","3022000"," We're above right now, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3022000","3024000"," So what would you be looking for here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3025000","3027000"," So let's say let's say price stopped right here today."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3029000","3032000"," You'd be waiting for the bloodbath down, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3033000","3034000"," And then the rejection down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3034000","3036000"," So as soon as you see that rejection."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3038000","3039000"," Has this rejected yet?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3040000","3041000"," No, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3041000","3042000"," This is not rejected."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3042000","3043000"," It has."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3043000","3046000"," So if it does roll, let's say this rejects here,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3046000","3047000"," though, it rolls down."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3047000","3048000"," It does this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3048000","3049000"," Five billion."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3049000","3050000"," Fuck."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3050000","3051000"," Yeah."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3051000","3052000"," Go short right there, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3053000","3055000"," And then you're on and you're ready to rock."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3055000","3057000"," So that hourly trigger is key."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3059000","3061000"," How are we bullish right here?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3061000","3062000"," The answer is no."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3063000","3066000"," We are not bullish until we back check the hourly trigger"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3066000","3067000"," and it's successful."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3068000","3069000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3069000","3070000"," We beat this shit over here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3070000","3072000"," That's your confirmation of bullishness."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3082000","3085000"," Let's look at this right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3112000","3114000"," Okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3142000","3144000"," Thank you."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3173000","3174000"," Another trade right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3174000","3175000"," I'm a buyer here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3175000","3176000"," I might get left behind here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3202000","3203000"," This is what I want."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3203000","3205000"," I want that trade right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3206000","3207000"," I want to be a buyer here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3207000","3209000"," Now watch, if I get left behind here, right?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3209000","3210000"," That's okay."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3210000","3211000"," We got left behind."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3211000","3212000"," You got our one."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3212000","3214000"," You could go right up to this R1 right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3214000","3215000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3215000","3216000"," Up here and start, start doing this."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3216000","3217000"," Come back down and go up."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3217000","3219000"," I can try to jump back in right there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3219000","3221000"," I want to go right up to this R1 right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3221000","3222000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3222000","3223000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3223000","3224000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3224000","3225000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3225000","3226000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3226000","3227000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3227000","3228000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3228000","3229000"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3229000","3230760"," Whoop up jump right here."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3230760","3232080"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3245160","3247500"," Whoop."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3247500","3249000"," I love you, Mr."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3249000","3250000"," Talking Monkey."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3250000","3251000"," I love to."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3251000","3253000"," You've been here this long, man."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3253000","3254000"," I do, brother."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3254000","3255000"," I want you to know that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3255000","3257360"," I know something, you know what I know, Mr. Talking Monkey?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3257360","3258740"," You're going to take this shit and teach other people, brother."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3258740","3265740"," I know that. You're going to have an impact on other people, my man. Seriously."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3265740","3275740"," You're going to make a difference."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3275740","3286740"," Where we roam, what's going on, brother? Good to see you, my man."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3286740","3291740"," Hey, how are you doing, man? Sunday never ends."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3291740","3297740"," He said I bought a Boeing 225 for tomorrow because I like it when people open doors for me in life."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3297740","3302740"," That's fucking hilarious, bro."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3302740","3307740"," In truth, I'd really like to see us below the hourly trigger to take that trade."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3307740","3314740"," So either we hit 4800, buy it there, and then add to it below the hourly trigger."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3314740","3319740"," That was probably my plan, but I'm going to say to you something, okay?"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3319740","3328740"," From a historical perspective, starting tomorrow, we should have a gradual pullback into the end of January."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3328740","3338740"," You're going to be looking at the end of January around the 26th and the 29th to buy a dip for the real true SPX all time high."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3338740","3343740"," Now, if that's the case, right, and we make that all time high,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3343740","3353740"," you are going to then be positioning yourself for a pretty major correction into the March 21st, maybe the date, March 21st."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3353740","3356740"," Now, that doesn't guarantee it's going to happen."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3356740","3359740"," All the time, we trade outside of those ranges and stuff."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3359740","3362740"," There's no guarantees. I don't come between being like,"
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3362740","3364740"," I'll come to this, this is Jesus, and he's wrong."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3364740","3367740"," I'll chase price wherever it goes. You guys already know that about me."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3367740","3371740"," I'll pour myself out to the bull side, and I will sit on my hands to the bare side."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3371740","3377740"," You guys already know if I have a thesis that we're going up and my thesis is broken, I don't stay in that thesis."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3377740","3383740"," I don't like sitting those calls. I'm going to zero. I chase price, so be aware of that as well."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3386740","3394740"," Yeah, I like the idea there, Jay, like just like scoop up Friday, Saturday, Monday, you know, just like burn all that data and that spread."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3395740","3399740"," Catch a little bit to that downside. Make a nice, nice payday."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3399740","3401740"," If I take that trade, I'll let you know."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3401740","3405740"," I will tell you before it happens. It's never after. You'll never hear us."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3405740","3413740"," Of 100 trades, I might miss one or two entry or exits, but mostly due to not being a pay and close this or something like that."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3413740","3417740"," But if I take that trade, I'll let you know. I'll say something to you that I'm in that trade."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3418740","3423740"," Oh, hello."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3423740","3428740"," Hello, I'm expecting the downside move."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3428740","3434740"," I'm going to place the trade in the money just so you know."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3434740","3442740"," I'm going to be looking for 450 would be the extreme low for me and likely 460."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3443740","3449740"," So that's off of 480. So somewhere in there. I think that's the extreme."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3449740","3453740"," One, two, three down there."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3459740","3462740"," I appreciate you guys being here with me too. Spend your day with me. I really do appreciate it."
"R6W6Ttvi-Mw","3462740","3465740"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow. Look forward to it."
