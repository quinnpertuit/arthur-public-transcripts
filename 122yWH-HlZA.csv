"72990","75210"," Good morning, good morning, good morning."
"76170","78690"," I'm late this morning."
"79610","87010"," I've been working all weekend here, burning the candle at literally every week. "
"89950","91470"," Give me just a second here."
"96470","98050"," We're going to have a little chat this morning."
"105690","106250"," All right. "
"110390","111130"," Hope you all did."
"111270","112670"," Well, hope you all had a great weekend."
"125320","129820"," Okay, so I've got the rock on the background. "
"131020","133160"," I'm going to bring up."
"134980","137220"," Oh, what's that right there?"
"139200","139880"," What's that?"
"140840","143660"," Oh, what's that right there?"
"146860","152140"," Yeah, I'll get rid of that one right there."
"153120","154860"," Yeah, this is important, right?"
"155540","159200"," We closed above the green line. "
"160140","161500"," We know what happened."
"162220","163480"," We've only got a few minutes until."
"164860","167220"," We only have nine minutes until we open. "
"167560","172720"," So there's a few things we got to talk about here this morning that are important."
"174500","176920"," And I'll do the levels with the hair in just a moment."
"180980","182040"," And look at that. "
"182280","186800"," Our three are to and why did we gap up all that kind of stuff we're going to go under."
"186940","187400"," Go over."
"191420","192120"," Look at that. "
"192220","194040"," S one S two eight out here."
"195460","196980"," We left that gap behind."
"196980","198120"," I'm sure we'll come back. "
"198260","201680"," Well, not sure, but I think we'll come back to fill that some point."
"203460","204760"," Then we'll get back to that gap."
"205040","206860"," And what are you guys thinking about the open?"
"207320","211180"," What do I think about the open this morning and some of the important stuff here?"
"214000","216440"," I want to see us come back here. "
"217220","224460"," I want to see us come back here to these lower levels, fellow let lower levels, but there's there's"
"224460","225660"," how bullish are we?"
"227300","229540"," And how bullish we can become."
"231720","233340"," Not a retest, but."
"235320","238580"," I'll show it to hear what I'm talking about real quick for you open. "
"238580","239680"," I'm going to explain some here."
"240120","241060"," Very simple."
"241440","241580"," Okay. "
"242320","243160"," This morning."
"243160","249000"," And the power."
"251020","252360"," What's happening right now?"
"253320","254400"," We're going to get rid of this. "
"254580","256540"," This is just this is insane, right?"
"257160","258959"," See this big blue line right here coming up."
"259420","262720"," This be what just ripping green line under here."
"262880","264500"," We're going to go and look at the four hour. "
"265460","265940"," Right."
"266320","267980"," We're underneath here in the four hour."
"268820","270420"," And now we're on the daily, right?"
"271260","272260"," This is what I want you to see. "
"272260","274980"," So let's look at the daily here."
"276960","278760"," And where we actually are, right?"
"279020","282580"," You can see this green line here three, nine, forty nine."
"284600","288060"," Personally, I would like to have seen, you know, we come up here. "
"288600","289460"," It bounced off."
"290900","295460"," The cats right here at like three eighty six, three eighty eight or so."
"296320","300980"," And you get that giant fall through right here, like moves, like giant move. "
"300980","303420"," What we're doing is we're opening above here."
"304380","305540"," I never really like that."
"305680","309140"," You know, that seems like the thruster power heading in today. "
"311780","317700"," We'll check it on the open, but personally, this is the stronger move here."
"317940","319640"," I want you to see that as we open this morning."
"321540","323920"," Also opening above three, nine, forty nine. "
"324040","328280"," I'm kind of like, you know, I don't ever like peak."
"328280","329060"," You know what happens?"
"329200","330300"," We peek our head above shit."
"331280","332560"," They come straight back down. "
"332880","334180"," So like the will coming across."
"334520","337840"," We know you have the meme where the clouds and the plane is coming around."
"338780","341540"," And you see like the will dip his head up and then we go back down again. "
"342220","343620"," I don't like ever seeing that."
"344620","346260"," And that's what we talked about on Friday."
"346820","349360"," So this is the key number here with three, nine, forty nine, right?"
"352100","356520"," And we're going to, we're going to highlight that this morning before we do anything else. "
"357560","359380"," Three, nine, forty nine."
"360880","362740"," And you see how low that is, right?"
"363020","364680"," Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on."
"365520","366820"," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. "
"367140","369660"," So it's in Dolly G."
"370840","371820"," There it is right there."
"371900","375780"," According to the acting may I try on his Capitol has passed the code of the infection."
"376120","376720"," Excuse me. "
"379120","383840"," So at a minimum, right?"
"384140","385940"," I don't like the idea of."
"385940","390280"," of us trading as high as we are right now."
"390780","393000"," I just don't like it. "
"393080","395620"," I'd like to see if this is gonna get wonky here real quick."
"397180","398380"," Well, I don't like it."
"398720","402300"," I prefer to be like, boom, we slam back down at 388. "
"402840","405280"," We get that power move on the open."
"405760","407640"," So you guys know what I do overnight."
"407920","409380"," You guys know what I do over the weekend. "
"410180","412780"," Some of you guys know that you'll be like, yeah, you know what?"
"413000","417240"," I don't tap, doesn't put enough, enough risk on."
"418440","423260"," Now at a minimum, the 389 is, so we had the 386 number I would have liked."
"424260","431980"," Now for the bulls, let's go, instead of retesting 3D6, it's three, we're gonna retest 3D9. "
"432680","434020"," Or you'd at least wanna see that, right?"
"434240","439820"," That test of 3D9, 4D6, and then more rocket tips."
"439820","444040"," The velocity, the velocity, it's just the move behind us."
"444500","445460"," All these moving averages. "
"446760","453140"," And the next thing we have to look at here is there was an automatic short at 394, and we"
"453140","461120"," know JPM is coming in for supposedly coming into cell 4060."
"462060","465480"," We know we've got a sideways move coming up for ER season."
"466080","469200"," I want you guys to be hyper aware of that stuff. "
"470520","472040"," In all of your bullishness."
"472600","475280"," But you wanna be bullish at the same time."
"475920","485610"," I want you to see what's going on here. "
"494670","495830"," Got two minutes left."
"496110","498150"," I mean, please just love a peek."
"499450","506650"," Let me, just put these levels in for you before we get open here. "
"506950","509710"," Cause I don't want you guys to get fucked over on this opening bell."
"510270","513350"," There goes that yellow line down here."
"513549","516570"," This is the, that's where the bull's wanna at least retest here. "
"517530","521429"," Can you remember we've got the other lower area."
"521549","525270"," We've got 3D6 and we've got 3D9, 4D6 or so."
"526550","533970"," We'll see if we can catch a, if we can snap some levels in here. "
"537850","539110"," Back to the stuff up."
"544280","547680"," 3D6 somewhere, 3D6, some will come back and work on that one."
"555100","556720"," House of pain, y'all, right?"
"556880","557580"," We set it on Friday. "
"557880","558800"," House of pain."
"566160","567380"," We'll throw that one."
"567580","570520"," I don't know what's going on with this software right now. "
"571660","573620"," All wonk is all fuck."
"582460","585200"," We'll deal with it."
"587000","589040"," Bears and shock this morning, right?"
"589600","591380"," Works until it doesn't work, right?"
"593940","596600"," No, we didn't sell off before open. "
"596760","598220"," We got a minute left until the bell."
"599140","608900"," So the pivot point is 385.58. And that's roughly where this number is right here, right?"
"612540","614960"," So here's your pivot point down below."
"615440","622840"," Like you guys already know about, I would have liked to have seen at least the test of 3D6 for"
"622840","624380"," a velocity move up higher. "
"625780","634700"," We know about now the gap that we're creating, that 3D918 is going to be an important number,"
"635000","635020"," right?"
"635580","640200"," So we have 391, 75."
"646110","654650"," If you're in the gap up crowd off the bell, this is your next target of the gap up."
"654650","658170"," This is your, what your pivot is, you see here. "
"674340","676360"," Give me your first jump point right here."
"676500","677120"," I'm going to write that in."
"683870","689070"," So moving average, can write MA moving average right here. "
"689190","692690"," This is your daily moving average right here off the bell."
"692790","695130"," So we're open right now, the 3D9.48 or so."
"695830","702420"," This is your, this is your bam, we're just off and running. "
"704940","705440"," Right?"
"705780","708980"," And then you've got down below here, 3D6, 3D5, 58."
"709360","714980"," This is your pivot point, but this is also another major, major pull signal."
"715300","717740"," These two are going to be your keys for the open this morning. "
"718400","726900"," 3D9.48, 3D5.58. If you see either of these two, we get a reaction on either of these two,"
"727900","728800"," it's on, baby."
"729900","733800"," It's on, we're cranking the 394 for the automatic short above."
"739470","743410"," And the automatic short on Friday was 394. "
"743550","748150"," It's now 395.42. Way up here."
"753240","755640"," It's actually, we have a, you know, we have a expansion, right?"
"755860","758280"," And Friday, that level just gets higher and higher."
"763320","766120"," I don't think we get tired too, but if we do, we do. "
"766580","767080"," I'm open to it."
"767940","772700"," We got Valhalla 40159."
"773380","774240"," Way up here. "
"781980","783860"," Valhalla, baby."
"796160","800240"," These moving averages are, are screaming."
"801560","802880"," Screaming. "
"805140","811020"," It's one thing when you get like the one minute, the five minutes, the 15 minutes, the one hour,"
"811620","818200"," the daily, when you start to see the daily come underneath, underneath here, it's the force is to"
"818200","818940"," be reckoned with."
"823140","824220"," Whoa, whoa."
"826660","830260"," Let me, what do you want to call velocity?"
"835960","836900"," Right there. "
"836900","840700"," And you actually have a strong velocity below it too."
"840800","841800"," So we'll write one down here."
"843240","845440"," We'll write a moving average velocity too. "
"845680","855560"," When you've got some powerful stuff going on in the"
"855560","856800"," market right now down here."
"857980","860800"," And there's another way for me to show this to you as well."
"862800","867100"," If you're a bear, you, if you're a bear and you want to get super duper bearish, it needs to"
"867100","868620"," be underneath these two numbers right here. "
"868620","874640"," And unlike most weeks where I committed, I'm like, Hey, this is your pivot point, specifically"
"874640","875040"," today."
"877260","883840"," You do not want to f around as a bear unless we start breaking these two figures right here."
"883920","884060"," Okay. "
"885820","891320"," You want to, you want to be like, you know, you know, you like, sell the rip around here and"
"891320","896780"," we're like, Hey, you know, this is, this is the dip that I buy here, I'm going to warn you"
"896780","897580"," if you're a bear that."
"899620","903640"," There's any kind of retest here and here in that, that dip get bought."
"905280","906720"," Be really careful in here. "
"906820","914060"," If you're a bear, you need to get, you need to be like getting underneath 35558 to take any kind"
"914060","914800"," of a short with."
"918510","920610"," Like you don't want to be seeing this nonsense here."
"920610","923190"," You don't want to be seeing this nonsense here if you're a bear. "
"923190","926010"," You want to see like."
"928210","930790"," A failure, profit taking, right?"
"931090","934530"," Couple bounces we head down and I would still not be bears here."
"935390","938470"," You want to see something like that, get underneath that pivot. "
"939650","943170"," Just to start even, even start showing before you take the short."
"943950","945470"," And it is nonsense in here."
"945570","947290"," I want you to be warned as a bear that. "
"948330","952090"," Outside of profit taking, there's a, there's a ramp going on in the background."
"953250","953810"," Okay."
"956480","958420"," Be wary down below. "
"965030","966510"," 3191 back here."
"966930","967990"," If you do get underneath."
"969490","972850"," If you're a bear out there watching right now and we do get underneath. "
"974650","975870"," That pivot, right?"
"976450","978230"," It'll be swift down below."
"980010","985150"," It'll be a swift move lower and you're probably looking at 372ish something like that."
"987070","988930"," You got three, 381 above. "
"989330","992550"," Then we have 372 70, 375."
"996970","998190"," 74 right here."
"1001480","1003420"," So there's so much juice down below. "
"1004660","1007460"," That if you're a bear, there's no reason for you to put risk on it."
"1007620","1011060"," So you don't need to call the entire, the entire move."
"1011920","1014980"," You don't need to put your finger to the sky and be like, we're going here. "
"1014980","1016240"," No matter what you say."
"1017780","1020380"," What you need to do is know that."
"1022580","1024220"," There's a fat, chunky move. "
"1033079","1034619"," You know, if you're looking at this hair, right?"
"1035000","1039020"," If you're a bear, you need to know that you need to get underneath here."
"1039619","1041180"," And there's a giant move down here."
"1042260","1043819"," You need this part of the move. "
"1045660","1047180"," You don't need this post it here."
"1048080","1049600"," You need this section is right here."
"1049880","1050580"," And this will be swift. "
"1051800","1053480"," We'll go over this more than why that is."
"1055860","1058900"," There's a return to balance that could take place underneath here."
"1059260","1062120"," And there's a, there's a test of balance above. "
"1064820","1068020"," From some previous areas that we've been, been to in the past."
"1068920","1070380"," Why I'm saying that to you."
"1070700","1078280"," And you can already see there's a retest going on. "
"1079320","1081120"," Right at three to nine forty eight."
"1085520","1089400"," For the importance right here of a retest of this, this, this is on right here."
"1089820","1091800"," And to be truthful and honest with you. "
"1092820","1093920"," The stronger move."
"1095000","1098600"," Higher is more than likely down here at a three to six oh four."
"1100420","1105480"," The strong to me, we'll get a strong move out this, but the big strong move is here a bull. "
"1106240","1107560"," Big strong move is like."
"1108980","1109760"," Like that."
"1111120","1112260"," It would be monstrous. "
"1113380","1113880"," That's that four."
"1114020","1115800"," This is the four or six move right here."
"1116640","1118940"," This is the like a three ninety five. "
"1120140","1121160"," And sell it."
"1121960","1122800"," Do you know what I mean?"
"1127250","1131630"," We put the book back back on for you so you can see us playing back down to retest."
"1132290","1134750"," The gap is right here. "
"1136250","1139050"," That's the red area that you see below the iron bars."
"1148770","1149990"," We're going to talk about."
"1153610","1156350"," If we're bullish today. "
"1156970","1160930"," And we take off right on this semi velocity line right here."
"1162170","1165410"," Max today's three ninety five forty five."
"1165590","1169010"," We come down and test this three to six area right here. "
"1170270","1173070"," We start looking at some higher highs and like four hundred or so."
"1174810","1176770"," We'll see what happens after about here to see."
"1177990","1180350"," What they want to do with this this morning. "
"1183100","1185520"," We're going to look at another plate."
"1185720","1187020"," We're going to look somewhere else for real quick."
"1188040","1188800"," And see. "
"1189740","1191080"," Remember last week when we were."
"1192480","1194260"," I'm going to show you guys something here."
"1197140","1201100"," I think last weekend or something I was like guys got to be careful heading into. "
"1202660","1204440"," The weekend here is a Friday."
"1204440","1207460"," The thing was like the thirty first heading into the second and."
"1210560","1212020"," I said to you guys. "
"1213620","1218560"," You have to be careful here because there's a there's a chance that the market."
"1219020","1220660"," It's like throw a piston or something right."
"1221720","1222840"," Behind the scenes. "
"1224320","1225920"," It changed colors."
"1226820","1227680"," Like red and white."
"1227860","1228520"," I don't like that green. "
"1251720","1252500"," You guys."
"1263840","1264800"," Last week you remember."
"1265200","1266740"," So it's like that Friday Saturday. "
"1266940","1270560"," It's like you've got all these other things saying that we could throw a piston in the market."
"1271400","1272360"," At the same time."
"1274060","1275140"," It was being asked. "
"1275560","1276160"," Hey, should we."
"1279620","1287100"," People over here were like, hey, Cap."
"1288000","1289120"," Be buying this. "
"1291200","1292740"," This market down here."
"1294260","1297660"," And I said, you know, from my case, I don't like buying it here."
"1297980","1299300"," Not extremely low enough. "
"1300000","1303760"," And utilities didn't sell off energy didn't sell off."
"1304280","1305820"," And not surprisingly though."
"1306200","1306720"," They rotated. "
"1308540","1310360"," Into more risky."
"1311520","1312860"," They were rotated in the communications."
"1313200","1315480"," They rotated in the FinTech or finance. "
"1316080","1319840"," They rotated in some rotation into into tech."
"1321500","1323220"," There's a couple of things you need to know in here."
"1323720","1325860"," First one, you got, you know, you got this ramp here. "
"1326100","1327880"," Wherever you come above this green line right there."
"1328560","1329640"," We trade over this."
"1329860","1331900"," It turns into a giant move typically. "
"1332300","1332580"," Not always."
"1333860","1335860"," This is coming into that green support."
"1337540","1338340"," This is the. "
"1339300","1340300"," Twenty-seven EMA."
"1341420","1344300"," Once we're up here, you can see this three to six right here."
"1344860","1346240"," This is the number I'm talking about. "
"1346320","1347620"," But I also want to be aware of."
"1348560","1348960"," A couple of things."
"1349740","1351860"," Instead of us rising on selling. "
"1352980","1355960"," On the order flow on the dome on the dome right down."
"1357100","1358560"," We knew that we had fires."
"1358580","1362120"," We knew that we knew that the banks and the institutions are buying all this. "
"1363720","1366460"," And, you know, this is probably not done right."
"1366700","1368900"," And when we get up here, we trade up here."
"1370520","1371940"," There is another thing that we know. "
"1371940","1373700"," And that is that JPM."
"1376560","1378000"," Supposedly is going to sell this."
"1381500","1385360"," Probably, I think it's four or two on four or four or three on five. "
"1385840","1387320"," Four or six zero, I think."
"1388280","1388840"," On SPX."
"1389300","1390140"," We know that they're here. "
"1390600","1392180"," And they let it go and let us go higher."
"1392960","1393060"," Possibly."
"1394360","1399080"," The reality is if we have ER season and we start fucking around up here for a little while. "
"1399340","1401800"," All they care about is that we eventually roll over to right."
"1401940","1404340"," So this is like playground for ER season."
"1404340","1405280"," We talked about that. "
"1406680","1408060"," We could probably bring up."
"1408340","1409620"," You guys want to see us."
"1409940","1418680"," And then, of course, you'll hear talk on the internet saying, oh, we're going to start, you know,"
"1418980","1420160"," turning the market around here. "
"1420360","1422180"," And just glad I see you later."
"1422320","1423120"," 2020 took two."
"1423240","1424380"," I know that talks out there too. "
"1426500","1428460"," But so far nothing's really changed, right?"
"1428620","1429760"," We have this area up here."
"1430360","1431780"," See how you have this balance here."
"1432620","1434560"," You have this, you have this balance area. "
"1434720","1435760"," It's the balance area below."
"1436640","1438160"," And we're peeking our head up."
"1438660","1442060"," Check here to break above this balance area. "
"1442280","1443960"," The next next place is above, right?"
"1444500","1448720"," That's where you get that four, six, four, ten area, trading up in here again."
"1453880","1456340"," So we could SPX real quick."
"1461170","1462090"," Likely past. "
"1470570","1472090"," See that yellow bar."
"1472230","1473410"," We talked about this last week, right?"
"1473590","1473810"," See that?"
"1474090","1474950"," Start trading in here."
"1476510","1478910"," Come into the end of earnings season. "
"1479530","1481790"," And if they're disappointed or anything like that."
"1482390","1483430"," GPM's your buddy."
"1483430","1484410"," He's already there going. "
"1484610","1484930"," We're ready."
"1486210","1487070"," Sell us down."
"1488550","1498550"," Then we went magnet and over here at 36.30 heading into the 31st of March, right?"
"1498810","1500330"," We're already following that path, right?"
"1503570","1506090"," Yellow line, probable path of GPM caller. "
"1506330","1509390"," This was the bear case thing in the last week."
"1509730","1511870"," So far, that's out the window at this point, right?"
"1513870","1516490"," I had to give you guys the most bear bear possible outcome."
"1517990","1520430"," We're following the probable path of GPM caller at this point. "
"1522990","1523610"," We'll see."
"1523790","1528830"," We'll see if we get above here and start trading higher after earning season."
"1529150","1532470"," You better hope you see he has done what they're supposed to be doing. "
"1532470","1535470"," We want to see some kind of a racer of this."
"1536830","1537710"," Problem path."
"1538610","1541010"," It's possibly bumped here to come up, come back up. "
"1541510","1543910"," You don't get the full strength of GPM."
"1544330","1548330"," We know about where you put your hedge on some point."
"1548770","1552870"," And either here or here that I can withstand this move higher. "
"1554210","1555370"," For another trip, Laura."
"1560360","1561520"," Well, there we go."
"1562000","1562100"," Boom. "
"1563020","1563660"," Right off."
"1563920","1565300"," Look at that."
"1565300","1566060"," Boom. "
"1566300","1566980"," Like it was nothing."
"1570690","1571410"," There's that little."
"1571610","1573470"," There's almost a pinch break right there, right?"
"1573790","1573870"," Boom. "
"1574230","1574370"," Higher."
"1575870","1577110"," You got any one, 74."
"1582040","1584960"," What do I say to you if you're a bear at the start of this broadcast this morning?"
"1586080","1587820"," I said, do not fuck around today. "
"1590380","1591920"," Do not fuck around."
"1609160","1611300"," You guys want these over here so you can see them?"
"1612080","1612420"," Start today."
"1642040","1643860"," You guys want to look back real quick on. "
"1645920","1646400"," Yeah."
"1646760","1648600"," You ain't nothing to look back on."
"1649840","1650740"," I mean, shit. "
"1650900","1651560"," Look back on."
"1655380","1656260"," New highs."
"1656940","1657880"," Higher highs. "
"1658220","1659140"," Higher lows, baby."
"1660740","1662340"," You guys want to look back in time?"
"1671390","1673250"," You want to see that area back here?"
"1675030","1676090"," You see it right here?"
"1679290","1680350"," You are R1."
"1680590","1680910"," R2. "
"1681350","1683930"," R3 is that R2."
"1684110","1686050"," Remember Friday I said this is not an act short."
"1687670","1687690"," Right?"
"1689330","1691050"," Kind of your automatic short right here. "
"1691970","1695050"," But because there's so much velocity, more likely up above here."
"1696350","1697990"," And then let's look back in time."
"1702930","1705050"," We have the mess back here for you. "
"1706990","1714860"," And you wanted to be looking at this right here, right?"
"1715740","1717200"," We spent a lot of time here."
"1719220","1720200"," This is R1."
"1720340","1722760"," We're coming back to check this area this time, right?"
"1722920","1723700"," We've traded this. "
"1724240","1724940"," We've got the cent lower."
"1725560","1726020"," We've got total."
"1726280","1726660"," Hell no. "
"1727400","1728340"," We're going higher, buddy."
"1728500","1729640"," Our demand is higher now."
"1729880","1730960"," Well, it was back here, actually. "
"1732040","1734560"," And the path forward is up, not down."
"1735300","1736460"," It's a pretty big move here, right?"
"1736620","1737620"," This is important to see."
"1738620","1741480"," We're coming back into this resistance here. "
"1741600","1743480"," There shouldn't be as much resistance here, right?"
"1743960","1746380"," If we've already come down and we got told no, we're going higher."
"1747180","1747660"," We sold off."
"1747820","1748960"," Remember we sold off for 14. "
"1749300","1750480"," It's not an automatic short, right?"
"1751260","1751680"," Already hit it."
"1752260","1754960"," So we're coming back up here for a second check, right?"
"1755720","1756700"," So we want to see."
"1759020","1767600"," We want to see some new acceptance up here. "
"1767600","1769720"," We found 1,000,000 pounds of bonds in motion."
"1770200","1773000"," I received 1,000,000,000 pounds of bids."
"1773420","1776060"," I want to accept it up here and start making this move higher. "
"1776940","1779060"," And find out if this is real or if this is fake."
"1780320","1782160"," DPM is waiting over here for you."
"1785640","1787180"," We're already cranking, right?"
"1788260","1789360"," We want to know what's up up here. "
"1793080","1795020"," And bears know if we get accepted up here."
"1797520","1800380"," That we're looking for the real, we're looking for another test over here."
"1800380","1804620"," We're like, I don't know if this was just an algorithm up here that's old. "
"1806400","1808960"," Was it just enough juice up here to take this down?"
"1810740","1811180"," Right."
"1811700","1812820"," Bam, automatic short."
"1813820","1814300"," Sell it down. "
"1815840","1815900"," Right."
"1816220","1819940"," Find out if there's real believers down here and we know that the banks bought this."
"1820760","1825080"," So we're going to come back up and make some power for moves higher. "
"1825080","1827500"," I would still."
"1829120","1830220"," Still in here."
"1831420","1832480"," Be careful. "
"1835260","1836220"," Be careful."
"1843330","1845490"," I'd still say to you that."
"1850090","1854990"," Don't be putting two and two together and you'll hear stories that were going to, you know, 420,"
"1855650","1857230"," 430, any of that nonsense. "
"1857230","1860070"," Don't just don't get too bullish yet."
"1863240","1864220"," Don't get too crazy."
"1868400","1870480"," You know, they're sitting here wanting to sell this, right?"
"1872560","1873660"," Just don't get too crazy. "
"1873900","1874200"," Don't be good."
"1874460","1874940"," I know that you guys."
"1875580","1876300"," Bears, bulls. "
"1876580","1877760"," You guys drink pool-aid like it's."
"1879340","1880900"," You guys pick it like it's going out of style."
"1882000","1882740"," Not you guys. "
"1882980","1887060"," You know, you can't see to be like 500 by next week cap."
"1887840","1889300"," I'm like, I don't know."
"1890800","1894900"," If anything, bulls need to, because of the velocities, bulls need to try to get up here and just"
"1894900","1895860"," hold on to their life. "
"1896700","1897640"," I would have liked to have seen."
"1901170","1902970"," I truly would like to see."
"1905650","1906670"," Some kind of a."
"1909410","1910330"," Something like that. "
"1910670","1911290"," I want to see that."
"1911370","1911750"," I want to see."
"1911910","1915350"," I want to see those buyers step right in and push this higher. "
"1917970","1919550"," Right now, you know, good."
"1919550","1920370"," It's not great."
"1940740","1942520"," Hit it over here so you can see it. "
"1942840","1944920"," I'll put this velocity back here."
"1946640","1947140"," And."
"1958800","1959580"," There we go. "
"1963700","1964420"," All right."
"1964420","1964880"," Yeah."
"1972980","1974060"," Let's go through your. "
"1975580","1977260"," Go through your stuff this morning."
"1978440","1980020"," You guys are talking about."
"1982440","1983960"," Am I still in Tesla calls?"
"1984120","1986160"," We think of course I'm still in Tesla calls. "
"1987060","1988500"," I got time on that shit."
"1989240","1989860"," Time, baby."
"1990600","1991140"," Time. "
"1991620","1993660"," I'm still in Tesla shares and calls."
"1996600","1997760"," Good morning, Harushik."
"1997920","1998620"," Morning, Johnny mode. "
"1998980","1999600"," Good morning, Ross."
"1999900","2000560"," He trading shorts."
"2001500","2002080"," My brother. "
"2003280","2005300"," Oh, yeah, a winky."
"2006440","2008040"," Now we up in this B."
"2008640","2011580"," Good morning, R.S. Dean James phase on."
"2012420","2013020"," Morning, Wink. "
"2014160","2015140"," Lisa Cullen."
"2015560","2016040"," Babka Dude."
"2016360","2016720"," Good morning. "
"2018380","2021400"," Perushi said I deleted Friday's stream was planning on watching over the weekend."
"2021400","2022620"," I apologize for."
"2022760","2024180"," You know what I can do is send you a link to it. "
"2024520","2026120"," I couldn't leave it up due to."
"2028000","2028880"," Copyright stuff."
"2029620","2032340"," So, Harushi apologized for not leaving that up for you. "
"2032740","2033200"," H bomb."
"2033540","2034060"," Chase winter."
"2035600","2037860"," I guess no back test 30 set 3870. "
"2038980","2040720"," They have 39 48."
"2041020","2042000"," They have a velocity retest."
"2042640","2045460"," It's actually 38 six and the numbers change every day. "
"2048300","2049580"," Ten of times to be on."
"2049800","2052000"," The polls like to blow their load early in front run."
"2052520","2052920"," Think of this. "
"2053060","2053440"," Kind of run."
"2053739","2055260"," Blah, blah, blah."
"2055260","2055679"," Out of the channel. "
"2055840","2056120"," Made resistance."
"2056820","2057739"," Blah, blah, blah, blah."
"2058440","2059100"," David West. "
"2059260","2059540"," Good morning."
"2060380","2060920"," A little back testing."
"2061239","2062540"," What's the vernacular?"
"2062840","2062980"," Dracula. "
"2064440","2064880"," Yeah."
"2065340","2067360"," I apologize for my voice this morning."
"2067520","2069659"," I've been in meetings all weekend. "
"2070320","2074159"," I've been meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting."
"2074159","2076380"," Do some drinking on Saturday night really late."
"2076900","2078500"," Meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting on Sunday. "
"2080280","2081219"," Lee Honda morning."
"2081420","2082100"," James Andreas."
"2082280","2082580"," Good morning. "
"2083420","2085400"," You see that BBBY stuff this morning?"
"2085980","2087679"," Who was awake at 4 a.m. for that alert?"
"2088639","2091000"," Who's alarm went off at 4 a.m. This morning it said D."
"2093639","2094440"," BBBY baby."
"2095239","2095800"," CSM jazz."
"2096300","2096700"," GM gang. "
"2098540","2099160"," Yeah, that's right."
"2099320","2099880"," I woke up this morning."
"2100040","2101100"," I had some white two alerts. "
"2101100","2105320"," I had two key alerts this morning before they're opening this morning."
"2105780","2107180"," 4 a.m. Number one."
"2108220","2109120"," John Deere. "
"2110180","2110880"," A moment."
"2111740","2113660"," They said right for repair."
"2114660","2116540"," I think that shit came out like one in the morning. "
"2116660","2117900"," I'm like I gotta post that bullshit."
"2119360","2123700"," Cause you know they were going to sell John Deere if you can repair your own shit."
"2124500","2128300"," And then 405 or 403 this morning, 401 this morning. "
"2129260","2132560"," Had an alert set for BBBY and it was off and running."
"2132800","2134960"," There's a lot of people that are trapped in BBBY."
"2135380","2137500"," A lot of pain for bulls there. "
"2139060","2143280"," And if they go up to two, three, four, five, six dollars, you gotta get out."
"2143740","2144680"," If you're if you're a bull."
"2146360","2149800"," I woke up post that on Fintuit this morning for the. "
"2151460","2153060"," Bulls are trapped in BBBY."
"2153440","2156780"," Cause I feel for those guys and girls and whatever."
"2161450","2165070"," Tis the raging boner pattern after our former squeakers are drinking a lot. "
"2166670","2168690"," Is this Tesla finally going to squeeze?"
"2169050","2169830"," I think it's been squeezing."
"2179830","2181250"," Front running bent in charm."
"2182150","2183270"," Nah, this isn't bent in charm. "
"2183550","2185570"," This is not a van at charm rally."
"2186510","2188230"," This is a real money bond."
"2190010","2190850"," What's this is?"
"2192530","2193950"," This was not a squeeze higher. "
"2194050","2196950"," I want to warn you guys Friday was not a squeeze higher."
"2197830","2198230"," Warning."
"2198910","2201410"," That is a fair warning. "
"2203030","2203430"," No."
"2204130","2205350"," I don't care what I mean."
"2205450","2206050"," I like to back down. "
"2206170","2207110"," I don't care what they say."
"2207210","2209390"," This is not a van at rally."
"2211830","2212230"," Incorrect. "
"2216690","2217830"," Uh, cap."
"2217970","2220150"," I was average the March puts into three, four minute plane."
"2220310","2220630"," You had another. "
"2220890","2221290"," Yeah."
"2221290","2227290"," You know, just, um, if whenever you guys are building hedges or put spreads for March, you, they're"
"2227290","2228090"," like a bunker trade."
"2228850","2234050"," We already know that we already know the bottoms and markets are typically capitulation moves"
"2234050","2235550"," straight down elevator down. "
"2236130","2239890"," We know that if you put a hedge in the market, you buy your heads."
"2240370","2242390"," You make sure that it's built to withstand a move higher."
"2244110","2245970"," And that you don't look at that shit. "
"2246470","2247450"," You just put it away."
"2248210","2250370"," You can we talk about this all the time."
"2250490","2251410"," You build yourself ahead. "
"2251990","2257090"," You trade the market up as it tops and trade sideways, right?"
"2257570","2260910"," Uh, you'll then go flat and you don't, you're not looking at your heads."
"2261930","2265110"," And then you come back and revisit your heads once the rollover comes into play."
"2267730","2268990"," Uh, puts here. "
"2273730","2274550"," Uh, gap."
"2274770","2276250"," I don't care about the gap."
"2276250","2279950"," You guys, you guys need to understand that something at play underneath the market right now. "
"2280490","2285830"," I'm feeling gaps, but you've got this, you've got this, you've got, you've got buyers, real money."
"2287010","2287670"," Buyers below."
"2288130","2289230"," This is not short covering. "
"2289790","2294130"," And then you've got this velocity of moving averages that are screaming up underneath."
"2294790","2296070"," Uh, the price of spot."
"2296350","2298410"," And you don't want to, you don't want to fuck with that. "
"2298490","2298870"," What is happening?"
"2299270","2300990"," The same way we're going to privilege move down."
"2301910","2309330"," When you're seeing like the big, the big, uh, like quarterly or monthly, uh, blood baths."
"2309910","2311930"," You don't, you don't step in the train in front of the train. "
"2313250","2314630"," Just let it do its thing."
"2317130","2318270"," As a bull, right?"
"2318510","2321870"," So as a bear, I'm mourning you of that right now is you don't get in the way of the"
"2321870","2322470"," train right now."

"2412190","2413470"," For those that work to do. "
"2420580","2425680"," If bulls cannot, uh, cannot break above here and find some support."
"2425880","2429440"," Well, if they can find some support here that we were in, we're back into this old trading range"
"2429440","2429640"," above."
"2433940","2435800"," Two trading range would be what?"

"2446440","2447040"," Something like that. "
"2451450","2453610"," Yeah, we want to see what I see a break above here."
"2453910","2454830"," We don't want to see a rejection."
"2455130","2458250"," We want to see a break above back into this old trading range that we had. "
"2461130","2464270"," And why, why we're not selling a media at this moment."
"2464470","2464870"," There's a reason."
"2466390","2468410"," That's because he had real money buying last week. "
"2469110","2469730"," We'll see."
"2478630","2480930"," And we'll do, uh, we'll do Tesla right now."

"2582940","2585280"," And this is, this is Paris, right on Dixie."
"2586400","2589780"," And we got some, we got some huge space down below here."
"2590460","2590580"," Huge. "
"2590580","2590800"," Huge."
"2592280","2592600"," Huge."
"2595260","2596740"," This is bullish for equity. "
"2600400","2601620"," It's down here, right?"
"2601940","2602920"," 103, 816."
"2603080","2604060"," We're breaking that 103."
"2606880","2614260"," Good for the Tesla. "
"2615080","2618380"," The Tesla."
"2629020","2630540"," 130 for today."
"2637120","2637600"," 128. "
"2642640","2643120"," 120."
"2643520","2643700"," Oh, yeah."
"2643780","2646460"," We're actually cranking towards another, another eight points. "
"2647060","2663620"," 1.2233. As"
"2663620","2664160"," a day is paying."
"2680400","2681120"," Sellers here."
"2690020","2691120"," Sold at once here. "
"2691840","2695260"," They're going to try to step back into self, Tesla down again right here, right?"
"2695400","2696140"," They're going to come back in."
"2696900","2698140"," Came back in here."
"2698220","2698520"," Worked. "
"2698520","2699400"," Worked last time, right?"
"2700080","2701540"," Us stokes extend gains."
"2702100","2705120"," S&P 500 up 1% next spot right here."
"2719360","2720920"," What two pools want to see?"
"2721200","2722460"," You guys want to know a pools want to see?"
"2725720","2732080"," This volatility that's in here, pools want to see a break above for the next leg, right?"
"2734420","2744060"," Solidation and then start moving higher to this 4.142. It's actually lowered right here. "
"2744240","2744520"," 138."
"2746660","2750200"," And you've got this, you know, see this big green line coming down right here?"
"2750360","2750940"," This is a four hour."
"2751160","2751740"," We can look at the daily. "
"2752120","2752940"," If you'll hide, actually gets."
"2756300","2758560"," Yeah, 138, raining down right here."
"2760500","2762900"," It's on a daily chart and then 234 above. "
"2767020","2768240"," It's on a daily, right?"
"2768860","2769520"," Want to get above?"
"2772500","2774220"," See that big blue line coming down?"
"2775460","2776680"," And then you start tweezing."
"2778660","2783700"," Do I think we get up here?"
"2783980","2784460"," I don't think so."
"2784580","2790920"," I think we get up here and then we literally start to roll the market over into the little mark. "
"2791220","2791680"," But that's me."
"2791960","2792620"," That's what I think happens."
"2794520","2795360"," Something like that. "
"2795360","2799200"," And then you see your bottom like March, late March, early April."
"2799560","2802260"," And there you get to, you get to summer by for the rest of the summer."
"2802840","2804200"," Well, a normal year here. "
"2804460","2808080"," And if we have one capitulation moment, we've got a couple opportunities for that."
"2808300","2810800"," Does the ER season for our bottom?"
"2811540","2812440"," March, April."
"2812920","2817260"," And then we've got another opportunity from the delta market in September or October, November. "
"2817680","2822160"," And then we have another one that I'm going to play in early January, 2024."
"2830670","2833010"," You guys want to take a snap, a snapshot of that?"
"2835110","2837070"," This is your first kind of stuff over here."
"2837590","2839310"," Important for bulls to get above here. "
"2840650","2841990"," You get a snapshot of that if you want."
"2842890","2844350"," And then if you want to go to the daily."
"2846730","2847710"," You always come back. "
"2850150","2850990"," Pause the video."
"2851890","2853090"," Take some snapshots here."
"2858220","2860100"," These buyers coming in last week. "
"2860940","2862460"," Pertulation retail sellers."
"2864600","2867080"," Institution by institutional buying right here."
"2873360","2875440"," Probably will see at least that one 38. "
"2876260","2878240"," And that there's the big boy right there."
"2878580","2880700"," Two 34 24 million."
"2881320","2882960"," That's when you got to sit there two 34. "
"2883780","2885380"," Two 34 24."
"2886100","2890260"," So that would torch some bears, wouldn't it?"
"2893920","2895460"," No spot right there."
"2902650","2904510"," Okay, back to spy. "
"2910650","2913190"," Okay, so we're back to our old trading range."
"2915270","2918430"," A job of bulls at this point on the on spy."
"2919650","2921870"," Or SPX, or yes, we're really afraid. "
"2925110","2927570"," What is the job of bulls right here, right?"
"2927770","2928890"," Take a rest, take a breather."
"2930210","2931330"," Pull out for a minute."
"2931450","2931810"," You did it. "
"2932510","2932950"," Congratulations."
"2934110","2935410"," Do not give it up."
"2938050","2940330"," Do not give this up if you're a bull. "
"2942170","2943370"," You want to see this hold."
"2946170","2949970"," Because the bears are naturally going to want to come in here and say, oh fuck no."
"2952070","2954450"," This is this is bad news for bears. "
"2954850","2957450"," Like bears do not want to see our one hold."
"2959050","2960470"," This is a reset, right?"
"2960690","2961330"," You end up going."
"2963310","2965090"," Talk about this back here, right?"
"2971530","2975610"," There's because what a bull's telling you is we're not done up here. "
"2980350","2981690"," We're not done up here."
"2981970","2982970"," And if you get acceptance."
"2985510","2987050"," You get acceptance up here. "
"2987150","2987730"," What does that mean?"
"2991320","2993020"," We're like, we're not done in here."
"2997610","2998150"," Right?"
"3008300","3011940"," Bears want no business with you or a bull."
"3012480","3014940"," Bears like I want nothing to do with you up here. "
"3015560","3016700"," We've already been up here."
"3016980","3018320"," We're not coming back up here again."
"3020620","3021160"," Right?"
"3021620","3022300"," Sellers like that. "
"3063200","3067020"," We're not done in here."
"3072840","3077500"," Yeah, I mean, this is the bottom of the upper trading the channel we traded in, right?"
"3078000","3080880"," This is we're back to where we traded."
"3081460","3083940"," A month ago. "
"3084580","3088960"," The scary part is the fact that we didn't go down to three seventy two."
"3089100","3091720"," The fact that institutions are buying and not short covering."
"3093120","3094740"," Is you have to give it. "
"3094840","3098980"," You have to give the argument to the bulls here and say, okay, we know this wasn't short covering."
"3099980","3102880"," We know that the market was bought by banks."
"3104000","3105620"," We know that the new year. "
"3106880","3108320"," And if that's the case."
"3109720","3114460"," Then the bulls have a have a have a they get another shot, right?"
"3115540","3119380"," They have to get or not have to, but if they can hold this, but they can hold this."
"3119380","3122340"," This are one right here and turn this into support. "
"3122340","3124680"," If they can spend time up here and turn this into support."
"3127460","3132700"," Then there is an argument to be made that, you know, the next true trading range is for 14."
"3133540","3134480"," At least, right?"
"3134900","3135500"," We know that's for this. "
"3135620","3136400"," Well, not for 14."
"3136480","3137420"," We know the sellers are there."
"3138060","3142440"," You're going to get market buyers that are going to want to sell before you get to for 14. "
"3142600","3148480"," So like 406 somewhere in there, you're going to expect if we hold this, you're going to expect."
"3149300","3152780"," Bulls to say we're trading three ninety one to three four."
"3152920","3155220"," Oh, six right now four or two on spy. "
"3155540","3158180"," I think, but forty sixty on yes."
"3168240","3169460"," So if you're if you're bear."
"3170720","3174560"," You know what work needs to be done for where we are right now for you to get bears. "
"3177580","3178580"," There's a lot for it."
"3178680","3182040"," Just so like an inverse right now you have bulls lose."
"3184480","3186300"," When bulls end up losing support. "
"3186740","3189320"," It's like bulls like hit by the step."
"3189500","3191880"," Like fuck no, we're going down at least a hundred points or a few points."
"3192220","3193500"," You get your chance again. "
"3195640","3198640"," Right here you need to see some you need to see some real damage here."
"3198740","3199960"," If you're a bear to get bears."
"3201500","3203680"," You got some work to do. "
"3213770","3215750"," Bulls have bulls have control right now."
"3215850","3219150"," They can take this from like they did."
"3220150","3221030"," Pick this one. "
"3222010","3224330"," Bulls have no problem if you come back down here."
"3225510","3228070"," And it wouldn't shock me to see at some point this week."
"3230430","3233290"," You know low on the weak somewhere down here at three eighty six. "
"3233410","3235390"," If we remain bullish you want to see."
"3235730","3237570"," Oh, you'll probably see three eighty six at some point."
"3240150","3242350"," Well, some bulls are in full control right now. "
"3252900","3258440"," Do they do that again?"
"3273270","3274390"," Yeah, no, it's not."
"3274910","3275730"," So look at Chase."
"3276330","3277490"," I would agree with you normally. "
"3278010","3280970"," A bit too far but too fast."
"3281210","3282410"," I would agree with you normally, but."

"3502110","3504150"," Whenever the market actually truly crashes. "
"3505910","3507930"," That means the bank's fucked up, right?"
"3508110","3509130"," Or the fed fucked up."
"3510090","3511890"," This is a controlled crash in 2022."
"3512990","3515330"," And they're going to try to control it again this year too. "
"3515330","3516710"," Does it work or not?"
"3516850","3517230"," I don't know."
"3517370","3518990"," I don't think anyone knows, including the banks."

"3543000","3547380"," And then right into the new year we saw that we saw the buying start. "
"3549160","3551320"," Shows the market is contrived."
"3551320","3552100"," It shows it all."
"3552260","3554500"," Shows that they know exactly where they can take it to the limit. "
"3555160","3556620"," And then and then lean off the limit."
"3560610","3561010"," Yeah."
"3561590","3563190"," I've been doing the same thing with Uber, man. "
"3563530","3563750"," I like."

"3583830","3583910"," So."
"3589210","3592170"," There's no real QT in the treasury and treasury department. "
"3593450","3594650"," That's all bullshit."
"3595270","3596130"," They're warehousing shit."
"3596770","3599010"," So they're performing QE QT on. "
"3600350","3601090"," Rapes right now."
"3601970","3604350"," And we're trying to punish the workforce."
"3605990","3608550"," I'm not going to go into it right now, but I've been over this. "
"3608550","3609610"," That does him."

"3802030","3803070"," So it showed method."
"3804790","3806670"," That's stuck in my mind now. "

"4452030","4459070"," It was an easy investment for an immigrant to come to the U.S. buy a medallion, have a job."
"4460070","4460770"," No background."
"4460790","4462570"," Well, this background text, but not really. "
"4463390","4468190"," And you could, well, basically you pass a medallion down, but then there's some complacency, right?"
"4468330","4469690"," Well, first the cost was prohibitive."
"4470390","4470750"," Don't attack."
"4470950","4472590"," See, and then the get there's some mind. "
"4472610","4473410"," Thank you, England's Pills."
"4473650","4475750"," Continue to act to hit the inflation target."
"4476170","4481370"," No single smoking gun that could identify as the key indicator or driver of inflation's persistence"
"4481370","4483330"," and thus monetary policy decisions. "
"4484970","4489650"," Maybe not quite mafia, but still adding the NPC is focusing on signs of persistence inflation."
"4491810","4493830"," Well, anyways, it doesn't really matter."
"4493870","4500950"," What really matters is if you're not old, you're young, they can assure you that there was a time"
"4500950","4504150"," when a taxi wouldn't come pick you up in certain places. "
"4504350","4508830"," They wouldn't, or if you like call for taxi, some places you can't even hail a taxi back in the"
"4508830","4508990"," day."
"4509890","4514430"," But they would take an hour to come pick you up two hours."
"4515110","4516190"," They were dirty. "
"4517310","4519370"," Well, sometimes the cabbies smelled really bad."
"4519770","4520710"," Not for bad reasons."
"4521190","4525550"," I have England's Pills as the rising policy rates to the current levels can be seen as significant"
"4525550","4528310"," progress in normalization of monetary policy. "
"4529130","4538370"," So if you travel into other parts of the world, they're not Uber and not Airbnb."
"4538850","4544670"," But a lot of systems are in place that are similar to Uber, Airbnb."
"4545610","4548350"," It's common to find a hotel in a second third world country. "
"4548350","4551150"," Even with sometimes things in the first country."
"4551150","4554070"," I think England's Pills as the NPC will respond forcefully if necessary."
"4555170","4557570"," They aren't like a traditional hotel. "
"4557790","4563270"," It says to the extent that the level of imported gas prices remain significantly higher than in the"
"4563270","4563510"," past."
"4564030","4566170"," Then the threat of second rounds may well remain."
"4568650","4574590"," Also noting Russia's oil output stable at 10.9 million Bowers a day in December and early January. "
"4576670","4578090"," Food delivery services."
"4578870","4581190"," All that kind of stuff is common in other countries."
"4581730","4586110"," So they're repackaging it for the U.S. And you really don't ever want to go back to a taxi"
"4586110","4588110"," type as a consumer. "
"4589350","4592450"," Now as a worker, you're getting fucked."
"4594390","4597070"," Being a driver for that like a Uber, you're getting fucked."
"4600170","4609100"," As a consumer, Uber is like the best thing since sliced bread being invented. "
"4609820","4610820"," Just taxis, man."
"4611020","4611460"," They sucked."
"4611880","4612060"," I don't care. "
"4612180","4613220"," Anybody says I hear that."
"4613660","4615700"," And that's the same thing with Airbnb."
"4616400","4617860"," I've seen I've had bad experiences. "
"4618020","4621520"," I think maybe those supply disruptions appear to have eased in the recent month."
"4624240","4627800"," I've had some really bad experience with Airbnb, but then I had some great ones too."
"4627800","4632540"," And then what used to be a golden golden age for Airbnb, but they're still better than most folks"
"4632540","4632680"," else. "
"4632680","4635880"," Just keep in mind the Bank of England's website still is not published."
"4636120","4638500"," The text that he's from this headline is coming through here on the wires."
"4639400","4641620"," Maybe I'll give Airbnb a more mixed bag. "
"4642060","4646640"," But some of the shit that I hear about the U.S. Natural gas futures are extending gains up by"
"4646640","4647760"," around 10% now."
"4650780","4654760"," Bank of England's post says longer term dynamics should shape UK policy."
"4655900","4657980"," Maybe I call Airbnb more of a mixed bag. "
"4658580","4659860"," And then food delivery has been brutal."
"4660020","4664460"," Bank of England's post says there have been some, albeit still tentative signs of normalization in"
"4664460","4666360"," the patterns of U.S. consumer demand."
"4668660","4674380"," And also since in adverse terms of trade shock can create self-sustaining inflationary dynamics. "
"4674980","4680180"," It can be understood as raising at least temporarily the level of unemployment that is required for"
"4680180","4681500"," inflation to be at target."
"4683500","4685760"," We're moving now 392 64."
"4688020","4689940"," The food delivery kind of sucks. "
"4690240","4694780"," There used to be a time when you could, like when I was young, that was actually something that was"
"4694780","4694980"," good."
"4695200","4698020"," You'd have like a local pizza place and all the teenagers worked there."
"4698840","4703340"," But then we had people getting sued, people driving fast, dominoes pizza was saying 30 minutes or"
"4703340","4703580"," less. "
"4705300","4709180"," You actually would actually know your pizza delivery driver back in the day."
"4711340","4716100"," Now it's like if you watch the McDonald's has like 50,000 bags."
"4716180","4719820"," We are starting to see the labor market indicators turn. "
"4723000","4727100"," For those interested, we have just published Bank of England's post full speech on the news feed"
"4727100","4727780"," for those interested."
"4728560","4730180"," Maybe I call it a mixed bag."
"4733940","4735440"," Probably of all of them. "
"4735620","4736960"," I'm looking at like food delivery."
"4737680","4741620"," Thank you England's post a slowing labor market could lower inflation risk."
"4743720","4747120"," Like Uber, Airbnb and food delivery. "
"4747120","4751320"," Thank you England's post as the extent to which an easing in the labor market induced by monetary"
"4751320","4752240"," tightening will."
"4752740","4755840"," I probably would say that the Uber is the best of the three."
"4756820","4758620"," Food delivery is probably the worst. "
"4759340","4761540"," Then Airbnb comes in."
"4764000","4771980"," It's probably Uber or Lyft and then the middle one is probably Airbnb and the worst is probably"
"4771980","4772500"," food delivery."
"4775420","4777740"," But you know Airbnb is not far behind. "
"4779200","4781480"," They're still better than most hotels and motels."
"4782980","4787800"," Especially at certain certain places like if you ever drive in places where there's not a lot of"
"4787800","4789880"," hotels and there's only really shitty."
"4790680","4796340"," I've seen some really bad motels and go hiking and biking sometimes and I'll go to places where no"
"4796340","4798900"," one is like middle and nowhere. "
"4800180","4804340"," And Airbnb is way better than some of those places."
"4810670","4816870"," I put this guy back on man's guys been talking and talking like me shut the fuck up captain."
"4824190","4826170"," Yeah, I turned his ass down for a minute. "
"4835260","4837020"," Am I buying Estau soon?"
"4837360","4837520"," Yeah."
"4839460","4840760"," I'd like to see."
"4842260","4844040"," I'd like to see a."
"4847060","4851980"," I'd like to see an Estau trade. "
"4853160","4859390"," I mean truly anywhere from 385 up to 406."
"4859970","4860450"," 402."
"4861770","4865790"," The good thing about Estau is if you buy them three or four months out and there's a lot of"
"4865790","4868290"," interest in an option. "
"4869710","4871190"," They tend to hold their value."
"4871550","4875730"," Bank of England's post is the Bank of England must ensure that any self-sustaining momentum and"
"4875730","4880870"," inflation at rates above the 2% target is squeezed out of the system by constraining demand."
"4885300","4888400"," I think a put spread up here would be fine at this point too. "
"4888640","4898260"," If you're anywhere from here into 406 or so and you were to get a put spread not you guys"
"4898260","4898740"," but me."
"4900300","4902660"," If I was going to get a put spread I'd probably get it."
"4904700","4905860"," You know for like a."
"4909180","4913540"," Like one for $3 then we try to make 30% on it which is a hundred percent of the"
"4913540","4914420"," actual buy so. "
"4916000","4918980"," You have a cost of a fuck and it pays $3."
"4920640","4925620"," Put some time on it."
"4926280","4932620"," And then I'd be trying to trade the market up into 406. "
"4933840","4936980"," Try to get this that's basically what the JPM trade is right."
"4940100","4945260"," He pays the market up or down and then he's paying for the other side of the free trade."
"4945300","4948120"," A million new jobs in urban areas throughout 2022. "
"4954340","4956560"," Can I turn the volume down in the background."
"4958220","4961580"," Is that low enough on the new spot?"
"4964060","4965480"," It's just grinding higher."
"4970510","4971890"," We'll snap another one here. "
"4989430","4990230"," Is that better?"
"4991630","4992610"," Yeah that fucking noise."
"4992850","4995590"," Sometimes they talk too much and sometimes they can't shut the fuck up."
"5000480","5002220"," I know we need that information but. "
"5014320","5017360"," Both try to turn resistance into support right now."
"5050010","5053450"," Yeah I can tell you you want to know why Regents probably down."
"5057550","5059330"," That's please higher back in September. "
"5060130","5061690"," It would be a good answer."
"5070140","5071180"," He did just."
"5073980","5075740"," We'll look up Regent for you. "
"5076020","5078300"," It did just repest friend."
"5092640","5094280"," Not a place to be looking at it."
"5097300","5099400"," On the daily just pin struck right here. "
"5100880","5101400"," 668."
"5103920","5105440"," Giant fucking gap down below."
"5108140","5109960"," But it did just pin strike here. "
"5129390","5130970"," I mean what's all that right there?"
"5135950","5136810"," Another one above."
"5138430","5143850"," To the pound it's a three week high against the dollar."
"5144130","5145350"," I'll stop around spot nine percent. "
"5158200","5159860"," Another gap down below here."
"5160880","5162800"," The whole shit's on a gap for man."
"5164680","5176120"," He actually"
"5176120","5176760"," has the. "
"5232800","5233860"," Fairs right now."
"5236200","5236760"," Winky."
"5238220","5242660"," Be careful of a rejection above at seven twenty three. "
"5243820","5244980"," Failure to close gap."
"5246740","5248960"," Careful of failure to close gap at seven ten."
"5323090","5325030"," This is a resistance point now bro. "
"5327270","5327890"," It's S."
"5328290","5330450"," It's S one but it's really not an asset."
"5330850","5332290"," It's a resistance now."
"5333330","5334590"," Turn this into resistance. "
"5336310","5337370"," Your first pass."
"5351450","5352970"," Careful even try to sell this on you."
"5354290","5356830"," I don't think I was going to be able to but. "
"5359690","5360430"," They're trying."
"5372280","5374540"," They're trying to turn this from support and resistance."
"5375120","5375540"," I guess we could. "
"5388020","5388980"," With R one."
"5390240","5391520"," Ten thing to turn into."
"5402170","5404250"," You want to watch like seven oh nine oh three. "
"5405950","5425630"," Yeah right"
"5425630","5425870"," there."
"5426070","5432700"," You do not want to see this bro."
"5433280","5434440"," Do you see anything like this?"
"5443140","5444380"," That's bad dude. "
"5444380","5445680"," I hope move higher."
"5446340","5448600"," If the real buyers are still here or not."
"5450560","5452760"," It's a important thing to be watching. "
"5461460","5462840"," Oh yeah baby."
"5464300","5466960"," Just teeing off on the spy right now."
"5467700","5469560"," Just teeing off on the spy. "
"5470660","5474500"," Just teeing off on the spy."
"5476700","5478200"," Just teeing off."
"5479660","5481240"," Some melt up right there. "
"5482300","5483320"," You guys want the next snap."
"5484380","5485700"," You guys ready for the next one."
"5487000","5488160"," You guys want to do it again. "
"5490440","5490880"," One."
"5492040","5492280"," Two."
"5493080","5493760"," Maybe one more. "
"5494320","5495500"," We all know how this goes right."
"5496580","5498900"," Probably get a failure somewhere up in here in R two."
"5502040","5506160"," So someone is going out to get the New York Fed inflation expectations data. "
"5508300","5509580"," You guys ready for the next one."
"5511060","5512420"," Guys I'm going to snap the next line."
"5537810","5538630"," Bears alike. "
"5539190","5541290"," Yeah I don't like that captain James."
"5544110","5547220"," He told me not to short though."
"5548560","5551740"," I listened to him. "
"5561950","5564290"," Let's check the five minute on Spy real quick."
"5564950","5565910"," Yeah that's moving."
"5572450","5574470"," Just teeing right off right there right. "

"5597340","5597860"," Okay."
"5598800","5599160"," NASDAQ."
"5601460","5602360"," Oh baby. "
"5603000","5603540"," Whoo."
"5607740","5609240"," Look at that right there."
"5613340","5615700"," You might get a pause here in the market. "
"5621330","5622910"," Careful up here if you're a bull."
"5624010","5625290"," On Spy be careful."
"5626870","5635950"," You know for something like this and then move higher. "
"5640200","5642000"," This is becoming support now."
"5642320","5644020"," So we're going to look at that right now."
"5644020","5649480"," So we're going to turn this into support now. "
"5656900","5658240"," Price targets now above."
"5668770","5671070"," You're looking to close this gap up here too."
"5686200","5688060"," No this is where they bought it. "
"5691040","5695480"," This is you know support but you know still not big support right."
"5696720","5698080"," Real buyers are down here."
"5701760","5706020"," And see this moving average is the one hour trend right. "
"5707900","5708840"," Look at daily."
"5710180","5710620"," Big."
"5714770","5715150"," Right there. "
"5719530","5720750"," I'm going to keep my stick clean."
"5722430","5722950"," So."
"5726330","5728310"," It's a pretty big support here right here. "
"5728370","5728830"," It's pretty good."
"5729990","5731130"," So move that up."
"5740500","5740980"," Yeah. "
"5750910","5752170"," I think I'm buying this."
"5753650","5754830"," They don't want us to get there."
"5754950","5755890"," Bears don't want that. "
"5756170","5757230"," This return here."
"5758870","5759890"," This trading zone."

"7195630","7205400"," know, it's not far away, you're gonna"
"7205400","7211880"," probably see some bulls take some money off the table here at some point, look at H.Y.D., we'll"

"7228640","7244070"," a little long in the tooth here, you want"

"7267100","7274060"," 10 minutes away now to get the 36 month bill option, $57 billion of free month bills, we're"
"7274060","7278420"," probably to cover up $2 to 50 in a prior high yield of 4 spot 41, the same thing's happened"
"7278420","7283860"," here, as well, the US $7 to $8 billion of six month bills, probably to cover up $2 to 78"
"7283860","7288000"," in a prior high yield of 4 spot 6, 3, 5 for any resistance in the support."
"7308850","7310150"," Back up in here. "
"7313030","7399520"," All right,"

"7437930","7447890"," I'm a little long in the tooth, yeah, to work,"
"7448510","7457230"," I want you to be aware that in a little tiny bit long in the tooth, so,"
"7457610","7461070"," it's all remains valid here."
"7463450","7469030"," Just know that there's going to be a failure at some point."
"7477140","7484240"," There'll be some profit taken up in here, a little long in the tooth. "
"7492700","7499080"," Anything above here is going to be, anything above here is going to be a gift."
"7520300","7524960"," Yeah, that's how I feel about, I don't even, I mean, I draw the boxes for you guys, but I'm"
"7524960","7530840"," like, usually they can just look at a chart and be like, yeah, probably going there, and then"
"7530840","7532740"," there, and then there, and then there."
"7536000","7545650"," Usually just looking at a chart and be like, yeah, I don't think it's,"
"7545770","7556800"," I don't think it's resistance, I think it's, I think it's, I'm not"
"7556800","7559440"," going to, I'm not going to call this supply here quite yet. "
"7566380","7571840"," More like five minutes away now to the giddy three and six month bill auctions, the US selling"
"7571840","7574400"," fifty seven billion dollars of three month bills."
"7574960","7580080"," They're a private cover of two to fifty and a prior high yield of four, four, one percent and the"
"7580080","7582760"," US selling forty eight billion dollars of six month bills."
"7583320","7588120"," They're a private cover of two to seventy eight and a prior high level 30 to five percent. "
"7590100","7593640"," There's a, uh, more like this profit taking up in here."
"7595700","7601860"," So you can, if you had this chart upside down and you were looking at a bottom in the market,"
"7601860","7608360"," you'd be like, yeah, you know, we're, we're, this is upside down, you'd be like, yeah, if we, if we"
"7608360","7615100"," round in the there or, you know, something like that wouldn't be surprised or stocking or prize,"
"7615100","7618120"," even a failure down here."
"7619340","7621840"," Just a little bit long of a tooth as we get up in here. "
"7631020","7634620"," If you want to look at it, I'm just like a five day."
"7638360","7641400"," Do what I'm talking about here, a little bit long of a tooth."
"7651360","7664920"," You know, something like this up here, right, even if we're resting here, or even if we, you"
"7664920","7668840"," know, a failure of trying to come up here and then we, you know, trade this down, pick that next"
"7668840","7669980"," leg up or something like that. "
"7671120","7685400"," Just somewhere in here, you're going to probably see the"
"7685400","7688560"," velocity slow and look for more buyers for continuation."
"7690140","7695400"," So you'll probably see spot gamut at some point saying that there's going to be, you'll see like"
"7695400","7697020"," the monitoring, the selling of calls."
"7699140","7704440"," You might not see the buying of puts, but just the selling of calls in here in this vicinity where"
"7704440","7704720"," we are. "
"7746230","7747850"," It's 11, 28 in the morning."
"7754980","7757920"," Trying to figure out the time-wise and what time we have to get up there."
"7782760","7785760"," Yeah, I, you know, you know, my take taste on. "
"7787780","7791480"," I've done, I've done a lot better with gamma when I've stopped."
"7798890","7799990"," I think I graduated."
"7806730","7809210"," I think I've graduated from a school. "
"7809610","7810190"," I think I've graduated from a school."
"7810350","7813030"," I'll leave with the three-month school picture, huh?"
"7824340","7834000"," Well, well, well, I'm hoping that you're sitting by a warm wood stove right now, your wife's"
"7834000","7834220"," boyfriend."
"7834220","7844120"," You come inside from being out in the woods all day long and you're brewing a cup of"
"7844120","7844400"," dough. "
"7849570","7850870"," No, there aren't."
"7851710","7855150"," So the two places you're looking above is 3980."
"7856910","7862300"," And you see the 4,000 up there. "
"7863820","7867880"," We've got about a $3.62 difference."
"7870780","7875600"," And between ES and SPY, so you can just do your own math there."
"7877680","7885080"," We've been talking about the squeeze ability up in here. "
"7886500","7891200"," So we should see some squeezing higher or a swept reversal here."
"7895380","7896640"," Oh, yeah."
"7898240","7901740"," The wife's boyfriend says he's got the bun warm around the sit-on in the sedan. "
"7902080","7902560"," Hell yeah."
"7903760","7905160"," It had you nice warm-on morning."
"7905720","7908460"," I love when I'm out in the woods, man, if you can get warm. "
"7908940","7910960"," It feels good."
"7911500","7916600"," Matter of fact, I was, uh, some of the stupid shit I did when I was younger."
"7917720","7922080"," I had a mo- I was talking about a trip that I took that was very dangerous. "
"7924360","7929160"," And over the years, I didn't know how dangerous it actually was."
"7931820","7935380"," And, uh, I was reminiscing about it the other day."
"7935440","7941600"," And I was like, it was more dangerous than it, uh, than I considered it to be. "
"7943480","7946080"," And it was danger, uh, freezing to death."
"7952900","7954040"," Oh, yeah, you got heated."
"7954400","7954760"," Yeah, man. "
"7954760","7958220"," Heated socks and heated gloves and those heated jackets are banging too."
"7961940","7962640"," They're expensive."
"7963160","7964820"," You can supposedly get them cheaper. "
"7965220","7975260"," You can buy like the the battery packs and the wires from like, uh, wish or something or, I"
"7975260","7976840"," don't know, um, China."
"7977060","7979060"," It's covered two to sixty one, two to sixty one."
"7979160","7979680"," Oh, right, Baba. "
"7979780","7983940"," It's full Spotify and, uh, wire up your own jacket."
"7986920","7988960"," So the U.S. sells 63 billion."
"7989100","7989920"," Oh, here comes the bears. "
"7990680","7993080"," And it was 75 spot for four percent."
"7993080","7993980"," Here comes the bears."
"7994380","7996320"," The U.S. six month bill bid to cover. "
"7996520","7997240"," Two to forty eight."
"7997460","7998240"," Two to forty eight."
"7998260","7998860"," And it comes the bears. "
"7999220","8004120"," Four to seventy one percent in the U.S. selling fifty three billion dollars of six month bill."
"8004320","8005460"," Here comes the bears."
"8005780","8007080"," Nine five percent of bids at high. "
"8011880","8013040"," Here comes the bears."
"8032400","8033000"," Yeah, I did."
"8033160","8034080"," That was a different time. "
"8034920","8036020"," But I have done that."
"8037020","8038420"," Did I tell you that story?"
"8039160","8041400"," When I packed me up, meet up amount with no gun."
"8042700","8043960"," That was a different story. "
"8044200","8045620"," That one was pure stupidity."
"8046920","8050620"," That's stupidity, but we took an elf and we didn't have it done with us."
"8051520","8052300"," I've done that. "
"8052700","8053680"," I don't know if I've told you that story."
"8053980","8054500"," I've been there."
"8054720","8056140"," If you just did that, I've done that. "
"8058000","8059720"," Blood pouring off the bat, you're back."
"8060400","8062440"," Just like blood draining down to the meat bags."
"8063380","8064800"," Walking through the woods after nightfall. "
"8066020","8070180"," I feel like a mile and a half to two to three miles to get back to someone with a"
"8070180","8070420"," car."
"8071820","8072560"," Then they're."
"8076320","8077460"," Oh, yeah, tell the other one. "

"8098010","8098250"," name."
"8098930","8104630"," His name is Mike and I hiked with this guy all over the place all over the world. "
"8104970","8108830"," I've been all over the world this guy and for many years he's a hippie."
"8109830","8115870"," Like a dirty hippie, but he was raised by a lot of outdoorsy people."
"8115870","8120890"," And so he wasn't the dirty hippie like you'd expect. "
"8121190","8122890"," This guy knew how to do his thing."
"8123250","8127890"," So I'd go on oh oh oh oh oh."
"8129190","8135370"," Dirty bears coming in right now oh oh oh oh. "
"8137650","8138630"," Dirty bears."
"8139450","8141090"," So you see that right there?"
"8141750","8145390"," This could be a liquidity grab too, but be real careful there."
"8148350","8158050"," So these so this guy is like he's a dirty hippie, but he's reliable and"
"8158050","8164190"," he doesn't panic and he knows how to hike and backpack through hike all this stuff. "
"8165890","8168430"," And so it's always a trusted companion."
"8169370","8174830"," If you do like hiking on a national park trail or something it's not really a big deal, but if"
"8174830","8183650"," you go anywhere where you're breaking trail and you're not feeling like an"
"8183650","8191090"," far away from civilization because if you need to trust people you're with and have experience on"
"8191090","8192750"," smaller hikes and stuff like that."
"8192930","8195389"," So I always did with this guy that this guy wasn't a gear whore or anything. "
"8195570","8200590"," This guy had worn equipment equipment that works."
"8204309","8214110"," And I went on a hike with three guys and the third man that was in the group was both"
"8214110","8214930"," of our friends."
"8217870","8224570"," He was outdoorsy and we were friends with this guy for a few years at least and he had all"
"8224570","8224930"," the equipment. "
"8225230","8226450"," This guy has this guy's a gear whore."
"8226629","8226990"," He had everything."
"8228430","8229629"," You can always tell the difference. "
"8229870","8233290"," I don't know if you guys know this or not, but so when you go to like a mountain town"
"8233889","8238670"," or you go to like a I don't know like a moab or something, you're going to see two kinds"
"8238670","8239110"," of people."
"8239650","8244270"," You're going to see you let's say you see a guy wearing a North-faced puppy jacket."
"8244270","8245389"," You in that national prime example. "
"8245570","8250450"," He advised us Sullivan says I don't see defense funds getting taken away by Republicans."
"8251750","8256510"," You guys may or may not know this, but it doesn't have to be just a puppy jacket would be"
"8256510","8256730"," anything."
"8257389","8264290"," If you see someone in the mountains wearing a jacket that's fitted, it's like an exterior like a"
"8264290","8264570"," shell. "
"8265070","8268309"," You see anyone with a puppy that's fitted fits them perfectly."
"8270190","8277570"," They're typically not a true outdoor, not true, but a true outdoorsy person."
"8278709","8281610"," I don't know how to word this nicely. "
"8284410","8289230"," Anyone that spends time in the back country, I don't care if you're a hunter, I don't care if"
"8289230","8294150"," you're a through hiker, back hype, pack or whatever you are, you tend to dress in layers."
"8295450","8302450"," So if you see someone wearing clothing regardless of what it is, it's frumpy for underlayers that"
"8302450","8306830"," are tighter or not tight, but you know like now you see people wear like a North-faced puppy and"
"8306830","8308389"," it's perfect fit perfectly."
"8308950","8310049"," That person's not, not always. "
"8310490","8314549"," Sometimes people have like they're they're I'm wearing this only this puppy North-faced when I'm in"
"8314549","8321530"," town, my in-town mountain casual, but a lot of people that spend time in the back country, they"
"8321530","8322209"," know how to layer."
"8323190","8331270"," So if you've got this layering system, your shit's probably not going to look pretty imperfect and"
"8331270","8337629"," it's not going to fit appropriately if you're just wearing that jacket or that sweater or that"
"8337629","8344790"," hoodie or that whatever piece of gear it is, it's not going to fit like it should because they have"
"8344790","8348070"," this layering system that you use when you go in the back country."
"8348790","8350450"," So this guy had all the perfect stuff. "
"8350650","8356830"," I mean this guy was paying for you know very expensive equipment and we had to always you know do"
"8356830","8359070"," a a shake down or something."
"8359469","8363469"," He'd be like I'll come take my shit out and all that stuff and he talked to talk and looked"
"8363469","8372270"," like he walked the walk."
"8372950","8378910"," Right before hunting season and I had some free time. "
"8379010","8382870"," I had like three weeks off for something and I'm like hey man I'm going I'm talking to all these"
"8382870","8388510"," different people saying this is where I'm going and this one guy in our friend group was like I got"
"8388510","8388890"," the time."
"8389010","8391350"," I want to go with you guys and I'm like okay great come with us."
"8391350","8395130"," I wasn't thinking we've got some blood coming to the market right now. "
"8395430","8397490"," A little bit of weakness right here in the market."
"8399190","8407110"," This is a couple that there's a couple lessons here so a little bit of blood right here a little"
"8407110","8407450"," weakness."
"8407890","8412770"," We're going to look on the five minute chart real quick and take a quick look here okay see that"
"8412770","8419910"," blue to the little green box right here so lean to see that green box right here okay it's like"

"8434060","8439700"," We're going to do a retest in the five minute see if the buyers are still down here or not. "
"8443680","8453640"," Do you know trying to think of where oh where's Jack guys remember Jackass"
"8453640","8457640"," passes and he guys out there know Wyoming you know Jack I'm going to look it up on this side"

"8479910","8486350"," Let's see where Jackass passes on a map and then I'll tell you I'll tell you exactly the entire"
"8486350","8495130"," route was it was 130 miles or something and the wind river range"
"8495130","8507430"," he has another wind river range the winds he also calmed the winds wind river range and"
"8507430","8517430"," it's fucking beautiful there absolutely stunning and beautiful and very dangerous and"
"8517430","8526670"," I'll tell you the the route that we were taking it's like 130 miles 140 um 130 140 miles or"
"8526670","8535250"," something like that one of the place one of the places that we got stuck on was uh I think"
"8535250","8544850"," Jackass passed wind river range trails uh yeah I think it was the Cirque I think it was the Cirque"
"8544850","8554770"," of the Towers loop or something like that anyways at this many years ago I think I"
"8554770","8559230"," think so it was a through hike we got dropped off in a town then we're gonna through hike through"
"8559230","8563310"," and get picked up on the side of road road or something like that a couple weeks later a week"
"8563310","8569110"," two later or something like that so we're up there and uh that real issue is it's time of year"
"8569110","8578610"," so we're there we're there I want to say and so it's just before it was just before hunting season"
"8578610","8585130"," started I think we're just before the rifle hunt so you saw hunters were up in there and um they"
"8585130","8589310"," were setting up camps and they were you can I don't think you can put thought licks out and stuff"
"8589310","8594450"," up there I think though but they'll go up there and they'll start uh watch trail watching and stuff"
"8594450","8600210"," find out where the game is uh out on the trail you got grizzlies up in there I don't know"

"9765680","9766740"," Yeah, bad company."
"9767040","9769440"," Yeah, it's it's tough to to find a good hike and partner."
"9769440","9771640"," Well, if you find one, they're gold. "
"9772040","9778400"," Like, if you find a good to this day, my buddy Mike and I still get together, still friends to"
"9778400","9781760"," this day, over those bonds that we made in the mountains."
"9783960","9785640"," And I do it alone now too."
"9785900","9790820"," Matter of fact, I did, I did the weight room trail alone all by myself. "
"9791220","9796680"," It was crazy because there was a when I finished it, I got down the backside of white rim trail."
"9796700","9797620"," This is big, big."
"9798200","9800720"," And I'd seen another group far behind me. "
"9800860","9803240"," And they were screaming and yelling at me."
"9803820","9807360"," Because I was at the bottom jumping up and down with my hands in the air freaking out."
"9807560","9808120"," I was all alone. "
"9808300","9809100"," There's nobody there."
"9809740","9815040"," And these people saw me and they saw them far away."
"9815160","9817880"," And I'm like, fuck yeah, you guys know what I did all by myself. "
"9818620","9821140"," I think that was 125 miles or something."
"9824230","9826550"," Rocky Mountain National Park is dangerous too."
"9826810","9827550"," I used to live up there. "
"9828310","9829870"," Rocky Mountain National Park shit."
"9830110","9834390"," I lived, I lived like 15 minutes away from the not 15, maybe 30 minutes."
"9835190","9837030"," Grand County is the middle of freaking nowhere. "
"9838450","9839830"," But that that's a dangerous place."
"9847460","9848560"," That's a dangerous place."
"9848980","9851960"," You don't you think it is in dangerous, but then you get up there all by yourself in the Rocky"
"9851960","9854420"," Mountain National Park and you're like, shit, I'm in the middle of nowhere. "
"9856820","9860440"," Oh, yeah, bears want it so bad right now."
"9861180","9864280"," Bears gonna tell you, we just got to like put it to grab above here."
"9864320","9865420"," Don't freak out yet. "
"9865800","9866920"," Going down, baby."
"9868460","9871920"," Blood, bright, red blood."
"9875620","9876580"," Right there. "
"9880970","9881450"," Blood."
"9886350","9888890"," We're going to check out where the five minute is."
"9899050","9900990"," We're going to move this blue one up here. "
"9903150","9903830"," It's seriously."
"9906570","9908230"," What is with this fucking thing?"
"9914940","9915860"," Put this box."
"9919400","9923280"," Alright, I'm going to get rid of this box right now because you can't pay in the ass. "
"9923720","9926360"," Okay, we're going to go to the five minute here."
"9927420","9928120"," Take a look."
"9930080","9933180"," Bulls do not want to give this blue line up right here. "
"9933620","9934620"," Leave it on the five minute."
"9936340","9938040"," So we've broken the one minute yet."
"9938880","9939780"," Yeah, broken it. "
"9939940","9941640"," Okay, so we've broken the one minute right now."
"9942960","9946340"," So we're going to start to we're losing, we're losing some steam here."
"9946380","9949300"," You see this trade underneath the one minute right now. "
"9950860","9953860"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop this down right here."
"9954000","9954100"," Okay."
"9955080","9956560"," And we're going to look at the five minute. "
"9957720","9959520"," And we're going to look to see."
"9959720","9964040"," So just so you know that this blue line, this white line right here is actually blue."
"9966160","9968420"," And we're going to make this a little bit thicker here. "
"9970520","9971840"," Losing a little bit of steam here."
"9978240","9981060"," And we don't want to give up this five minute here."
"9981060","9990830"," If you're a bear, you definitely don't want to see or hear a bull. "
"9992010","9995050"," You want to see like some kind of a move here and higher."
"9996330","9996730"," Okay."
"9998070","10003470"," You want to see a trade off here, which we've been doing all day long. "
"10003650","10005130"," But I don't think the bull run is over here."
"10005570","10010850"," There's wanting to be conscience of I'll just draw a line here so we can see it will put back"
"10010850","10012270"," in the one minute so you can see it."
"10018290","10020030"," You don't want to give this up right here. "
"10020030","10020290"," Okay."
"10022650","10026130"," If you give this up, we're definitely going down here to our one."
"10026450","10027890"," We're going to go back to the one minute. "
"10040980","10042260"," You don't want to see."
"10047550","10050550"," You know, I want to see the rejection here and trade down."
"10052870","10057890"," Although if you're a bull, this could be where you get that you know, moving to move higher. "
"10058790","10068130"," Start giving the stuff up though and you know, it becomes like we're losing some steam here."
"10068310","10071370"," So we get down to five minutes, break below that."
"10071650","10073530"," We're going to probably move back down to 15 minutes. "
"10076650","10077590"," Right there."
"10083410","10089400"," Yeah, kind of divide bad ass."
"10089860","10091580"," Kind of divide trails bad ass. "
"10091940","10098620"," I have this thing where I do if my if my either of my daughters want to do the CDT"
"10098620","10102480"," or C T I do the PCH maybe."
"10103220","10107320"," I'm not have no interest in the AT section type that stuff."
"10108780","10112860"," Probably that if there was a trail that I'd be interested in didn't probably be the CDT. "
"10114180","10115660"," That's a pretty bad ass trail."
"10115860","10118400"," I mean, talking about going through Arizona to Mexico."
"10120220","10122420"," And then all the way up into Canada. "
"10122620","10122940"," Beautiful."
"10123440","10123640"," Beautiful."
"10124660","10124660"," Beautiful. "
"10124860","10125480"," Oh, there we go."
"10126260","10127140"," A little bit of blood."
"10134310","10135570"," Now the real way. "
"10135710","10138350"," So the real key is not this level here."
"10138870","10140570"," This is the five minute right here."
"10140650","10141690"," This is a big level lose. "
"10142310","10143630"," This will take you to the 15."
"10146950","10148590"," One minute's already been given up."
"10148770","10150490"," So we're giving up to one minute right now. "
"10150630","10153850"," We're going to go down and test more than likely test the five minute."
"10154130","10155070"," That's that blue line."
"10160030","10162130"," No, I've never been to band. "
"10162430","10163470"," It's on my list."
"10164890","10167970"," When I was younger, I used to peak bag and shit."
"10168890","10170810"," I put together two big trips a year. "
"10171130","10172170"," I've never done band five."
"10172210","10172970"," I've always wanted to."
"10176170","10181130"," If I ever get a chance, if I ever get like a chance to do that stuff, I have like"
"10181130","10182590"," a small list that's left to do. "
"10183510","10184670"," You know, that's one of them."
"10185370","10186390"," Banff is on that list."
"10190210","10191550"," Yeah, I'd do bad for the minute. "
"10192970","10194990"," I have a small list of places I'd like to do."
"10197170","10198930"," Or at least at least show up to."
"10207720","10209140"," Yeah, it can be stressful, right?"
"10213480","10218640"," Yeah, proves my father went to South America and did a bunch of stuff down there. "
"10231430","10232290"," It's my daughter."
"10232570","10236890"," I would like to have this like we talk about sometimes."
"10237330","10242930"," But every year or two, I'll bring it up and she has no interest in it. "
"10243010","10244250"," But we hike."
"10245310","10246490"," We go on hiking trips."
"10248790","10251910"," Some pretty big ones for their age and stuff. "
"10251930","10254150"," We'll do one or two trips a year."
"10255170","10256550"," And the middle of nowhere."
"10257010","10260310"," But we don't hike all the time like we did. "
"10260450","10261010"," We lived out West."
"10261490","10266210"," So, you know, I'll say, I'll usually stay in the middle of like a three or four day back country"
"10266210","10266370"," hike."
"10266530","10271110"," I'll be like, do you want to go do you want to take a summer off and we'll just go"
"10271110","10275250"," hike the 80 or something or then we'll not say keep it the CDT or the PCA. "
"10276350","10280410"," And she'll be like, no, no, Daddy."
"10285130","10288630"," We did where the two put we just did what do we do?"
"10289610","10291550"," I can't remember this two places we just did."
"10292390","10294050"," They're up in Northern Michigan. "
"10294230","10294930"," We did pork pine."
"10299770","10300950"," Not the pork pine mountains."
"10301170","10302470"," We haven't done the pork pine mountains yet. "
"10303450","10304490"," That's what I want to do."
"10304850","10308930"," That's when I actually, I think I had that planned for end of summer and then some came up."
"10310130","10312450"," What have we done so far here in Michigan?"
"10314510","10317590"," We did this little lake thing that was a blast. "
"10317990","10323220"," We did, what did we do up here?"
"10326510","10334250"," We did Grand Island, which is off of Pictured Lakes National Park."
"10334250","10334810"," It was a loop."
"10336090","10337310"," It wasn't many miles. "
"10337530","10342290"," It was like seven miles, but it turned into 15 miles."
"10343890","10345450"," So, we went into this place."
"10345650","10348930"," We got a boat trip out to this island called Grand Island. "
"10349890","10351310"," No services or anything."
"10352150","10356130"," And supposed to be, I think, I don't know if it was seven or 12 round trip."
"10356330","10357490"," Maybe it was 20 or 30 miles. "
"10358290","10359070"," I can't remember."
"10359750","10363390"," I think, so I don't, let me see what the Loop Trail, Grand Island."
"10363930","10365050"," Well, this is a funny-ass story. "
"10368150","10372490"," Grand Island, I think it's a Loop Trail."
"10375770","10376870"," Grand Island Loop."
"10379830","10385030"," Yeah, so, I do, talking about understand understandings. "
"10385390","10386890"," So, this is gonna, you'll love this."
"10387750","10390710"," So, we went up this place called Grand Island, right?"
"10391570","10396070"," The trail is 20 miles, it's 20 miles in a Loop."
"10397210","10400670"," So, we get on the trail, right?"
"10401030","10403790"," And I think a three or 48 trip or something. "
"10405890","10409530"," And we hike in, I want to say halfway, or maybe a third of the way."
"10409610","10410930"," Let's say it was six or seven miles."
"10413850","10420410"," And the bridge is not, there's a sign that says the bridge is knocked out. "
"10422050","10424570"," And you should turn around or something."
"10425410","10429090"," And so, we're like, I'm like, oh, we'll go, we'll just cut through these woods over here."
"10430310","10434730"," And this island is like sand with like a forest. "
"10435210","10438590"," And so, you're, every, every step is like two steps."
"10439930","10445990"," And so, we end up like hiking around to get to meet back up where the bridge was out."
"10446810","10449730"," And so, we added another like six or seven miles onto the trip. "
"10449930","10453310"," So, now we're like 27 miles for this trip."
"10454450","10458270"," We get around the bridge that's out and it wasn't actually fucking out."
"10459030","10461570"," It was out to like motorized traffic. "
"10462810","10466530"," So, you could have crossed this bridge, this big high bridge."
"10468350","10472810"," And easily, so, we added like six or seven miles to this trip."
"10473590","10482290"," And which that's pissed off, tiled and pissed off, right away. "
"10482550","10483590"," They're all angry at me."
"10484030","10485070"," Of course, I'm pushing them."
"10485190","10485750"," I'm like, we got to go. "
"10485910","10488250"," We have, we have a back country camping spots."
"10488330","10489390"," You have to reserve them."
"10490130","10492190"," It's just like reservation system and stuff. "
"10492390","10493630"," And we have to get there and blah, blah."
"10493770","10496110"," You don't want to be camping on the side of this trail or whatever."
"10496750","10498290"," So, we're up there doing this, right?"
"10498590","10502050"," And we get to our first campsite. "
"10504250","10507010"," And it's on Lake Superior and it's cold."
"10507370","10513590"," I don't remember what, I don't remember when this was, but I think it might have been like May or"
"10513590","10515410"," something, but it was still cold up there."
"10515610","10520250"," Like Lake Superior is like 40, 40 degrees in May. "
"10521270","10529190"," Crystal clear, blue water, like glass, like glass, not like flat, but like, like crystal clear,"
"10529330","10531590"," beautiful, gorgeous water."
"10531870","10533390"," And so, we get to this first site."
"10533890","10537890"," There aren't many sites out there to camp, like designated camping back country sites. "
"10538770","10543890"," We get to the first site and there's like, I admit, I think I made these girls walk like, I"
"10543890","10546970"," think they, but at the end of the day, they'd walk like 15 or 16 miles."
"10546970","10548130"," It was a long ass day."
"10548310","10549110"," First day on the trail. "
"10550610","10557790"," This is after like a, a shakedown on land and then a boat trip across and then a shakedown before"
"10557790","10558450"," we take off."
"10559030","10564010"," And it's end of the day, it's like cold, winds blowing, I'm right on the lake and the winds blowing"
"10564010","10565570"," off the lake onto the island."
"10566370","10570010"," And there's a little stand of trees hiding this, uh, hold on a second here. "
"10574940","10579440"," There's a little stand of trees that's protecting this campsite."
"10579720","10587180"," And there's like, a bunch of kids, I say kids like 20, 25 year olds on the camp site."
"10588580","10591860"," And, uh, of course me, they bring everything right. "
"10593020","10596680"," And so I, uh, I'm trying to be, I'm angry at this family."
"10596880","10598460"," Like, where are these fucking people on my campsite?"
"10598900","10604560"," You can't come out here without a back country permit and you can't spend the night unless you have"
"10604560","10606000"," a back country camping permit."
"10606960","10607600"," Some pissed off. "
"10608740","10608940"," I'm angry."
"10611600","10615200"," And I don't want to go in there and talk to these people because I'm probably going to freak out."
"10617020","10618720"," I am, I'm like, I'm about to freak out. "
"10619940","10621840"," Okay, so we've lost the one minute, right?"
"10624760","10627340"," And the bears are now trying to get underneath the five minute."
"10632010","10634270"," This is, this is productive for bears."
"10635870","10640880"," This is the first target for bears here. "
"10641940","10643640"," Bears want to get underneath here."
"10643640","10647180"," Uh, we know what happens when we come to the five minute, right?"
"10647340","10647940"," You see it right here?"
"10648460","10649400"," And we launch."
"10650600","10652700"," Come back down, boom, we launch. "
"10653360","10658220"," And so this is our third test right now of the five minute."
"10658380","10659740"," You can see we pin struck it."
"10662060","10670320"," So we're going to see right now if the bears can get underneath the five minute price target below"
"10670320","10671060"," 39191. "
"10672100","10676620"," See another place for a bull to consider the move higher here."
"10677580","10679200"," And we get to our two above."
"10684760","10688060"," So we'll put that little green, little blue line down here again. "
"10690680","10692120"," Yeah, see it right there, right?"
"10692540","10700240"," You know the thing you're looking for is you don't want to see, you don't want to see the five"
"10700240","10702080"," minute start to curl over."
"10703180","10708360"," You want to see the five minute moving up like this."
"10710500","10712100"," So we're going to watch this real quick. "
"10721900","10723960"," You know, I'm looking for a couple of things."
"10725300","10726320"," Went to the bay there."
"10738100","10744680"," So I'm on this island and I'm sitting out on, where my pack was sitting on the beach on Lake"
"10744680","10745000"," Superior. "
"10745520","10746320"," It's getting cold now."
"10746320","10752140"," It's like maybe 40, 35, 40, something like that."
"10752660","10753720"," Get the wife, two kids. "
"10756480","10761000"," You know, we're pretty far out there for having kids with the end stuff."
"10762160","10764320"," And we're cold, mostly when I have a fire and stuff."
"10764460","10767000"," It's like these kids already partying and stuff doing the thing. "
"10770100","10772160"," And trying to break below right here."
"10776920","10778500"," We'll look at the 15 minute real quick."
"10782210","10785410"," Start breaking the five minute price target below 39120. "
"10789430","10791150"," Here's your 15 minute right here."
"10793030","10810040"," There's one"
"10810040","10810280"," minute."
"10821860","10831480"," So you got a so my wife goes out there and she's like, hi, we reserved this camp site"
"10831480","10840320"," for the night and they all stopped talking and just trying to be nice to them. "
"10841380","10842760"," And they're like, oh, no, we got here first."
"10845200","10850480"," And then so she breaks out the, breaks out the, because of course I bring everything I'm like,"
"10850480","10856380"," here's the, here's the Ziploc copy of our reservation for the site."
"10856600","10861280"," U.S. Treasury 30 year yield hits three week low of three spots, six, five, three percent. "
"10861640","10865700"," Lost down two spots, six basis points at three spots, six, six, five percent."
"10866700","10867280"," And you don't know."
"10867520","10874420"," And at 12 30 p.m. Eastern time, Fed Spostik speaks as well as Fed Staley, who gets interviewed by"
"10874420","10875140"," the Wall Street Journal. "
"10877120","10879560"," You don't know if somebody's going to die on what kind of event they've been drinking, and that"
"10879560","10882120"," kind of stuff, 391 or 19."
"10882980","10888100"," So Atlanta Fed President Bostik takes part in a moderated discussion, hosted by the Rotary Club of"
"10888100","10888300"," Atlanta."
"10889380","10893420"," Text isn't expected, but a Q&A with both the audience and media is. "
"10897590","10904050"," And she shows them the, she shows them the permit that we have camp."
"10905850","10909130"," And it's like, you know, like the entire conversation changes."
"10909570","10915630"," It's kind of like when you're setting someone up, you let them say what they want to say, and let"
"10915630","10917910"," them do their thing, and you let them make their arguments. "
"10918810","10923530"," And then you whip up the permit, and you're like, you're like, here, I got something for you."
"10923650","10924650"," Why don't you read this for me?"
"10926050","10927070"," And so they read the permit."
"10929690","10933870"," And there's like, the group is like six or seven of them, cool people, nice people. "
"10936330","10938990"," But they're, they're now having a discussion."
"10939730","10942910"," So my wife comes back down to the beach, and I just get up and walk back up to these"
"10942910","10946070"," guys, and I'm like, here, I'm like, I'll shorten the discussion for you."
"10947190","10948710"," I'm like, there's two ways we do this. "
"10948930","10950670"," You pack your shit and get out of here."
"10951630","10953970"," We're all what you guys stay in the site with me for the night."
"10954810","10956270"," Are you going to move your shit over?"
"10956530","10959690"," I'm going to take that plot area over there from my wife and my kids and I."
"10961350","10964950"," And it was cool because it wasn't being a dick or nothing about it. "
"10965090","10971930"," But what ended up happened was they stayed with us for the night in this campsite, and we had a"
"10971930","10981230"," big old fire, and we drank fireball and shots of bourbon together, and we cooked as a group, and we"
"10981230","10984290"," ended up hiking together the entire time for the rest of this time of the mountain."
"10984290","10990150"," And of course, you've got like an old man like me and a nine-year-old."
"10990270","10997830"," I think at the time it was eight, and a 14-year-old girl, and my wife, and they have"
"10997830","10998910"," to keep up with us now. "
"10999170","11007430"," So we ended up camping with these people the next night and hiking all the way out of this island"
"11007430","11011510"," together and making great friends in the middle of nowhere."
"11011510","11016730"," But it was interesting because when we first met these people, they were pretty much trying to give"
"11016730","11020090"," me the bums rush, and they wouldn't."
"11020210","11024230"," If we hadn't had our permit, we probably would have gotten the bums rush on that trip. "
"11025450","11026870"," There's a lesson to you."
"11026870","11030610"," If you make reservations in the back country, keep everything."
"11031130","11032750"," Print everything out, keep it on. "
"11032890","11039670"," You're at all times because you'll find people out there that'll be like trying to take your shit,"
"11039870","11042350"," especially if it's in like a hard to stay place."
"11046530","11049650"," And they got real friendly once they saw that we had all the permits."
"11053070","11054350"," For my wife who has pissed. "
"11067140","11076360"," Yeah, I could have been a real dick too, and I mean, I was dick-ish for a moment."
"11076940","11079360"," I gave the ultimatum, the quick ultimatum."
"11079620","11080580"," There's no discussion here. "
"11081040","11085000"," You can stay with us if you like or pack your shit and get out."
"11085000","11089500"," And of course, the more level-headed in the group is like, yeah, you know what, you're being nice"
"11089500","11090320"," for us, aren't doing them."
"11090440","11093540"," Like, fuck yay, if you want to hang out, we can hang out. "
"11096980","11098960"," This is the, you're negotiating."
"11099660","11099940"," I'm not."
"11100880","11105240"," I know that, but then when you're talking to my wife without her, you're seeing the permit that you"
"11105240","11107060"," thought she was negotiating with you. "
"11107840","11109180"," That's not what's going on here."
"11111160","11112600"," You're negotiating with her."
"11119800","11121620"," Oh, Wheeler Park is awesome. "
"11122760","11124300"," Wheeler Park is beautiful."
"11125440","11127220"," The top of Wheeler Park is gangster."
"11129180","11132080"," It's a grand view. "
"11133720","11139860"," What do you say, Chase?"
"11140560","11141940"," The market is supportive."
"11151190","11152330"," What's the support of market?"
"11160960","11164200"," US two-year and 10-year yields fall to three-week low."
"11164680","11166940"," 10-year last-down four-spot one basis points. "
"11167120","11167920"," That will look up here."
"11167920","11167940"," That will look up here."
"11168420","11172920"," Two-year last-down four-spot eight basis points at four-spot two one-one-percent. "
"11174600","11180160"," And at 12.30 p.m. eastern time, fed spastic speeds in a moderated discussion hosted by the Rotary"
"11180160","11180800"," Club of Atlanta."
"11181300","11187060"," Text isn't expected, but a Q&A with both the audience and media is, and FedStaley is interviewed by"
"11187060","11187780"," the Wall Street Journal."
"11188400","11190140"," So I'm looking for some calls here. "
"11190880","11198860"," If we can get above 32.8, the live video of FedStaley's speech is now on the feed for all"
"11198860","11199300"," those interested."
"11200280","11201320"," I want to see us."
"11201520","11203360"," If we can get above here, I'll take some calls here. "
"11208240","11212360"," If not, I'll look below for a place to buy."
"11214020","11218780"," Bear in mind, the Rotary Club is an invite-only event, so there won't be any live coverage."
"11221580","11223620"," We're going to be in friends with these people the whole entire hike. "
"11223900","11226900"," We're going to be feeling like 27 miles total round trip."
"11228660","11231360"," We, uh, you want to hear some funnier story about this trip?"
"11232760","11236720"," So, uh, so we're, we're done with the trip, right?"
"11236820","11239880"," I think we'd spent two nights there or something, three days, two nights."
"11240620","11243240"," We're hiking out to the, um, pick up a ferry. "
"11244420","11247780"," And the ferry is like a boat, like a pontoon boat."
"11249360","11253880"," And, uh, open-air pontoon boat with chairs, seats on it or something."
"11254480","11257760"," And we're like a mile away from the ferry dock. "
"11260140","11262420"," Um, and I hear the ferry."
"11264140","11267920"," And I can't see the ferry, but I can hear it coming into the dock."
"11267920","11271740"," This ferry came in at like five o'clock or something, six o'clock. "
"11272800","11274980"," And it was like there and gone."
"11275260","11276600"," No one's on the silent right now."
"11276740","11278260"," There's like, there's there on the silent. "
"11278460","11281760"," There might be, I don't know, six groups of people."
"11282680","11286120"," So this isn't like high summer when it's packed or anything like that."
"11286260","11289840"," It's, this ferry is like one trip in the morning, one trip at the end of the day. "
"11291260","11294040"," So the ferry, I think this is Memorial Day weekend."
"11294380","11294860"," I think it is."
"11295280","11295980"," It's Memorial Day weekend. "
"11296860","11298580"," Normally I go hiding on Memorial Day."
"11298840","11301720"," On the high holidays, I'll go run away from all the crowds and stuff."
"11302120","11305760"," So we're, so the, so the ferry comes and I can hear it. "
"11306000","11308240"," And it's like, ting hits the dock and boom gone."
"11308920","11309460"," Nobody's there."
"11309800","11312180"," So it's not like he's waiting around for anybody's. "
"11312300","11313500"," He's like in and out."
"11314640","11320140"," And I'd, and I'd, I'd actually, I'd left my wife and kids behind to catch the ferry guy."
"11320320","11321620"," So I could be like, hey, hold on for it. "
"11321740","11325600"," Wait for me to get, you know, women and children back here that need to catch up."
"11326660","11330260"," And I think at that point, I was packing my pack and my kids back too."
"11330960","11336520"," So I, I get to the, I get to the ferry and the ferry is like gone like crossing the"
"11336520","11338060"," lake and he ain't coming back. "
"11338600","11339340"," No cell service."
"11340040","11341200"," No way to get these people back."
"11342200","11350360"," And he's, he's, oh, oh, all right. "
"11351400","11353200"," I'm long, three 93 C's."
"11354560","11356840"," Now we'll see how this works itself out here."
"11359960","11362880"," Long, three 93 C in the money calls. "
"11376180","11382020"," Re reclaiming or at the Fati, we're at the confluence of the one and five minute squeezing higher"
"11382020","11382600"," right now."
"11383820","11392860"," I'm going to keep some, some limit stop below."
"11404720","11405840"," Just a second here. "
"11407100","11410500"," Shortly expecting comments from Ted Spostik and Ted Staley."
"11419440","11420140"," All right."
"11427940","11433960"," So I, so I missed the ferry and my wife and children are mad at me now. "
"11434120","11438080"," They're like, they're like, you took us out here and it wound up being cold."
"11439280","11445360"," Half the sheer campsite with some other people told us it was a 20 mile hike, turned into a 27"
"11445360","11446100"," mile hike."
"11446800","11449240"," And now this asshole made us miss the ferry. "
"11452180","11453900"," And they've, and I've been running them."
"11453960","11458640"," It's like, we're there three days total, two nights, we bike like almost 30 miles."
"11459200","11465080"," So there hasn't been like, you got a day of walking and then you make a camp, get ready to"
"11465080","11465280"," eat. "
"11466200","11470980"," And you only have, you know, two, three hours to do something for you to go to sleep."
"11471380","11473080"," So just trip it on its own."
"11473900","11477300"," It's a lot of time spent working hard. "
"11477300","11479320"," Now my wife and children are pissed off."
"11480920","11485880"," And we're about to make a camp right near where the dock is very, the ferry so we can grab"
"11485880","11486440"," it in the morning."
"11486960","11489880"," And they're hungry and they're cold, that kind of stuff. "
"11490440","11497560"," And I see some family is on a boat, unlike a pontoon boat."
"11498580","11503160"," And they're driving around the lake and it's like the end of the day."
"11503800","11505880"," And they're drinking beers and hanging out. "
"11507780","11515600"," And go up to them and I'm like, there's like a, like a, outhouse or something by this, this ferry"
"11515600","11515940"," dock."
"11516300","11518640"," And so they go to use the outhouse to women doing stuff."
"11519500","11525480"," There's this guy on the boat and the guy that's like, you got this guy sees me and the wife"
"11525480","11526320"," and kids and stuff. "
"11529220","11530760"," And he's like, you know, howdy."
"11530860","11531880"," And I'm like, howdy, how's it going?"
"11532340","11534860"," And I was like, hey, look man, I was like, I just missed the ferry."
"11535060","11536600"," I got my wife and two kids with me. "
"11536600","11537440"," And I'm on you."
"11537500","11541580"," It was nice to these people in this campsite, right?"
"11542060","11545620"," And I'm like, look man, I'm like, I just missed this ferry and wife and kids are cold."
"11545820","11546760"," I don't want to be here anymore. "
"11546960","11550780"," I'm like, if I gave you a hundred bucks or did you take me, take me back across the lake"
"11550780","11553460"," right here, park him a lot to like a mile away."
"11553980","11556500"," And he's like, he's like, of course."
"11557100","11561700"," And I'm like, I think if I didn't have my wife and kids of me, there's no way I could"
"11561700","11563020"," ever ask that or something like that. "
"11564200","11569420"," But dude, he loaded my wife and my kids and I up into his boat and took me took me"
"11569420","11570260"," across the water."
"11571260","11572620"," And he's like, I don't want the money."
"11572740","11573120"," I don't want the money. "
"11573240","11574140"," He even gave us beers."
"11575740","11577740"," And then we got these kids back."
"11577860","11578180"," Absolutely. "
"11578340","11580780"," White and kids or U.S. economy to continue slowing."
"11581420","11582620"," Like, you know, saved."
"11583760","11589280"," I don't just spend any more cold nights with this, this guy out in the middle of nowhere. "
"11591560","11594720"," And so we went back got burgers and all that fun stuff."
"11594720","11597520"," Got a hotel of hot tubs and all that fun stuff."
"11597660","11598940"," White and kids were happy again. "
"11600640","11602860"," So he got off the island after all."
"11606500","11612030"," And then we did Iowa Royal National Park."
"11612390","11613070"," He'd never been there. "
"11614390","11615690"," He looked that one up on."
"11616070","11616790"," That's a good matter."
"11616970","11618050"," He lived somewhere else in the country. "
"11618730","11623790"," I think it's the least visited or second least visited National Park in the United States."
"11623790","11625770"," And that one's badass."
"11626190","11629110"," If you guys are sailors, you can rent the. "
"11629470","11631750"," Fed Staley says the Fed is completely data dependent."
"11632170","11633270"," My views could change."
"11633970","11634650"," Oh, yeah. "
"11634850","11636350"," My views could change daily."
"11637730","11643190"," If you guys are in the first quarter, expects labor market to continue to slow and inflation to"
"11643190","11643690"," come down."
"11645310","11649410"," Best way to visit Iowa Royal is by sailboat. "
"11650870","11653710"," And you sail around the island rather than hiking it."
"11654670","11658090"," He goes swimming fish and hike and day hikes cap on the beach."
"11659670","11660470"," And you rent the. "
"11661810","11665890"," Fed Staley says my views are very consistent with the summary of economic projections."
"11666470","11668370"," You rent the sailboat in Wisconsin."
"11669550","11672370"," Otherwise you can get there by seaplane and just hike it. "
"11673570","11676510"," The Iowa Royal National Park picked that place out."
"11677310","11678030"," That place is badass."
"11680550","11681310"," Lots of mosquitoes. "
"11686120","11686860"," And I think they have."
"11688800","11690920"," They have like a restaurant part of the year."
"11691220","11693060"," So you can get like a burger and shit on the island. "
"11693420","11696440"," But then there's parts of the year where there's nobody there."
"11698520","11700200"," Like very, very low staff."
"11700760","11703300"," If you want like real quiet and privacy ego in the solar seasons. "
"11707080","11708480"," That's in the middle of nowhere too."
"11721690","11723010"," Isn't that Flix going to Valhalla?"
"11725910","11729070"," We were talking about or Winky keeps talking about."
"11729290","11731530"," Lidu look at Tesla Tesla's just sideways. "
"11733370","11738350"," Fed Staley says overall inflation is coming down, but mostly in energy and goods."

"14027900","14036200"," it's not my fault maximum 89 pounds in a set so they'll be like so like a firm person that"

"14076700","14086640"," to pin that price and the rate of the federal rate increase path the quickness that we're"
"14086640","14094140"," doing right now is not trying to bring inflation down it's actually trying to impact wages meaning"
"14094140","14099700"," like hey you're gonna be living with some of these inflationary prices and we're not seeing wages"
"14099700","14108420"," go up with it if anything you want to see wages go down settle down you're looking for companies to"
"14108420","14116340"," decrease hiring lay people off increase work responsibilities all that kind of stuff just to try to"
"14116340","14124640"," get our unemployment rates to raise higher quality of work life to get lower they can't tell you"
"14124640","14130080"," that so they're gonna tell you they want inflation to come down to make sense they can't they'll"

"14152840","14158020"," better not it's not it's not coming up high enough fast enough agree with that so that's why"
"14158020","14165680"," question are we gonna just pay sideways for 2023 and then once unemployment does get up there"
"14165680","14172540"," hopefully it does maybe by the end of the year you'll see like a contrived or a manufactured"
"14172540","14180720"," bullshit crash we could crash like a thousand points but he is at the price of that low it's"
"14180720","14187580"," probably not going to be 2,400, 2,600 or 1,400 this is where the Fed and the banks"
"14187580","14197180"," are trying are basically still fucking using MMT they're they're manufacturing a market let's say"
"14197180","14201500"," you had a thousand point crash from 4,000 we only go to three we were already at 3,450"
"14201500","14210160"," so if you bought the 3,450 bottom and a 3,000 bottom you're pretty doing pretty good right you"
"14210160","14215560"," DCA that and you're you know so when you see banks in the beginning of 2023 buying the bottom or"
"14215560","14221800"," buying in 2023 what's their real risk right now i'm sure in the background they're saying well we"
"14221800","14227680"," bought dune we bought it over we're adding a little bit here in the first of the year we already"
"14227680","14236060"," know they did right we know that we stopped going down in may May and so they probably bought dune"
"14236060","14242520"," or dune in july or that was they bought october and they bought the first of the year so let's"
"14242520","14249440"," just look at that for let's say we have a thousand point bloodbath from 4,000 down to 3,000"
"14249440","14259240"," they buy that they're doing pretty good the only"
"14259240","14265740"," way they really get the banks made a mistake otherwise they're at the bottom meanwhile you've sold"
"14265740","14273240"," everything you've as a retailer they're showing you they're saying look you sold all of tesla you"

"14290760","14300540"," at the 70 likelihood of what happens in this market the banks are probably at bottom already like"
"14300540","14310260"," the likelihood of what happens in this market the likelihood they've bought the bottom and you"
"14310260","14319310"," haven't not only that they own the market where you don't"
"14319310","14326750"," and if they do have that moment where we have a true market crash that a true market crash that"
"14326750","14334790"," is much lower 2500 1400 some crazy 1600 they own everything so they're going to sell into you"
"14334790","14341770"," anyways so they really do not they have the upper hand all along the way they have the upper hand"
"14341770","14352020"," right now they have the upper hand where we are in prime banks institutions have the upper hand so"
"14352020","14363370"," I don't think it matters what happens from here on out I think"
"14363370","14368330"," we could trade the 3000 they would still be in relatively good shape and they can sell they can"
"14368330","14374790"," sell you put calls this is something that they can work they can work with this market where it's"

"16761849","16769210"," is good work on the on the bears but still supportive in in its in context that makes sense you"

"16798790","16808820"," crazy moves so this is the one right here that i'm interested in buying down here and"
"16808820","16814920"," even with that you could buy 389 and you could buy 386 this is actually so this morning when we"
"16814920","16821140"," opened i was like man we can get down here at any point this week 386 this really is a"
"16821140","16830870"," bull it's a really good place to buy 386 a really nice place to buy this is stronger"
"16830870","16835990"," but this would give a stronger move higher too this will get to the 406 if you buy this 386"

"18567200","18575500"," trying right now it's a good place to not a bad place to grab some calls um it's risky if"
"18575500","18582280"," you're gonna grab calls here you have to have tight stops the safer trade is waiting for it to"
"18582280","18590860"," break higher so so the safer trade here if you're gonna take it you have stops tight here right"
"18590860","18594820"," here but the safer trade here is um you wait for a quick you have your finger on the buy"
"18594820","18605620"," button on calls and you you execute the trade right here let's move on that's"
"18605620","18610100"," the safer trade because right now tell you what they're trying to do the bears are like oh we're"
"18610100","18617180"," going to trap these bulls in here and we're going to drop it on them make sense they get a"

"19701810","19708850"," right now we're gonna go the rest of the week so um you've got a vol event on Thursday it's"
"19708850","19717170"," probably the biggest vol event this week right today's Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday um"
"19717170","19728550"," Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday so you get a vol event coming up you got CPI what"
"19728550","19735530"," the bears are trying to do here what the bears are trying to do tell you guys the bears trying"
"19735530","19745670"," to do so what they want to do it's still pretty not cranking up here right um"
"19745670","19751650"," you see this down here see this this is 386 that blue line that's the daily chart but bulls want"
"19751650","19758590"," to hold so you guys write this down get a piece of paper bulls are trying to hold 386 basically"
"19758590","19765650"," okay but they want to hold it's also a good springboard so 386 is a good place to buy a"
"19765650","19775630"," dip but on an hourly you see 388 in here right so you you definitely can see like if you"
"19775630","19780790"," can buy this if you can buy this 386 to 388 this is like a nice place to buy a"
"19780790","19788070"," dip and what the bears are trying to do is tell you the bears need to try to do tomorrow"
"19788070","19797650"," is get underneath this 386 you know to have a a bear wheat into CPI on Thursday"
"19799530","19807250"," the reality is that on an hourly we're still an uptrend narrowly here right so we're still an"
"19807250","19815190"," uptrend here so if this is where CPI is the hope would be as a bull that there's a place"
"19815190","19824430"," for you to buy a dip into Wednesday you know we have turnaround Tuesday right they talk about so"
"19824430","19830990"," i'm going to expect weakness into Tuesday and and if you're a bull you're going to attempt on"
"19830990","19838110"," Tuesday to buy a dip make sense that's what you're looking for on Tuesday is to buy a dip turn"
"19838110","19843950"," around Tuesday go down and then we get some volatility see that right there that's what you're"
"19843950","19853870"," hoping for as a bull volatility and maybe move higher afterwards or lower or whatever okay"
"19853870","19859010"," now the bears really want to do is they want to break that trend they want to get underneath 386"
"19859010","19867150"," you can't get bearish until you break 386 okay we need to see that and understand that heading in"
"19867150","19877010"," tomorrow that's when you get bearish otherwise this is just a function today tomorrow"
"19877010","19883210"," of finding the right dip to buy as a bull okay and bulls are in charge right now whether you"
"19883210","19891890"," believe that or not bulls are in charge 388 on an hourly and 386 on a daily is where bulls"
"19891890","19898570"," want to be buying if you want to cut your losses you're cutting them up you're cutting your risk"
"19898570","19908470"," under 386 doesn't make sense to you know how the bears win this is if you get"
"19908470","19916530"," underneath this 386 386 let's say right here is what the bulls want into Wednesday right bears want"
"19916530","19923570"," to get underneath this 386 so if we have a bloodbath on Tuesday and we have some kind of like"
"19923570","19930510"," oh please save me right we come right back into volatility on Thursday and then you see a 372 into"
"19930510","19935630"," Friday okay so that the rest of your week planned out for you okay so this is a very important"
"19935630","19940970"," area for bulls right so bulls will have their little the little bump and then volatility into"
"19940970","19946550"," Thursday and then down here this is where the bears actually take over again we start seeing lower"
"19946550","19956610"," loads so it's very important this zone right here is very important for bulls"
"19956610","19962590"," and bears this is the no-diddle zone not really no-diddle zone but this is where you buy a"
"19962590","19970630"," dip to go along and this is where you have your stops under here if you're a bull right and"
"19970630","19978730"," this is where a bear picked it up for a move lower into Friday so you can see how this"
"19978730","19987230"," this is setting up right now in the last hour of training right so where does a bull want to"
"19987230","19994570"," buy he wants to buy down here somewhere down in here whether it's now closed overnight the open"
"19994570","20000090"," tomorrow this is where a bull wants to buy who doesn't want to buy in here well you can intradate"
"20000090","20008750"," day trade this but where you want to be buying is somewhere down here makes sense to any guys you"

"20054270","20061270"," is you need confirmation is how bears get burned is how bulls get burned but a bear needs to do"
"20061270","20068610"," is understand that until you get the the rejection and that Thursday ball rejection do you get the"
"20068610","20077050"," actual the paying move because there's an opportunity in here for bulls to buy this weakness get"

"22541610","22541990"," Touch it. "
"22552910","22553890"," Touch 386."
"22554430","22557090"," Touch 385.14 for me."
"22562110","22564410"," Just get down there into the fucking bell. "
"22565010","22567750"," Because what they'll do is they'll trade it sideways in the overnight too."
"22590620","22592540"," We got 25 minutes left."
"22592760","22594020"," We can possibly get down here. "
"22594600","22596220"," We can possibly get down here."
"22597680","22599180"," We can possibly get down here."
"22599180","22601100"," It'd be nice to get down there. "
"22601120","22602080"," This would be the sweet spot."
"22606380","22607620"," Oh, hold on a second here."
"22609140","22609620"," 360. "
"22610840","22611920"," I'm sitting here."
"22612040","22612240"," Hold on."
"22613620","22614420"," Come on now. "
"22617440","22618160"," Come on."
"22618700","22619180"," What are you doing?"
"22622840","22625400"," This fucking website is such a pain in the ass."
"22629680","22634320"," We've got some problems here. "
"22635520","22638120"," This thing can be such a pain in the ass."
"22646770","22649070"," Get a little bit of new numbers coming in."
"22680890","22684990"," Sorry, I'm trying to get some updated information in the background and I can't see it. "
"22711660","22712680"," It's real close."
"22713820","22714780"," It's coming up."
"22724030","22725350"," Looks like right in here. "
"22728850","22729450"," 3561."
"22735730","22736730"," Right in here."
"22738230","22739050"," Come up a little bit. "
"22739790","22741050"," Oh, we're fucking so close."
"22745440","22747100"," Come on down, baby."
"22748280","22749560"," Come on down. "
"22752780","22753340"," Please."
"22753960","22754440"," Come on down."
"22765040","22765960"," It's coming up. "
"22772380","22773860"," Come on down."
"22774260","22775020"," Come on down."
"22776200","22777460"," Just a little bit more. "
"22777640","22778800"," Don't do that double bottom."
"22779380","22780420"," Come on down here."
"22780420","22781180"," Please for me. "
"22788990","22789510"," No."
"22791370","22793710"," I've traded a pauter in the past."
"22794530","22803650"," The question becomes what's not fair value, but there was a bunch of questions about the company,"
"22803850","22806590"," but do I like them as a company?"
"22806870","22808510"," Of course, I don't like them as a company. "
"22810190","22819370"," I know they do some nefarious shit, but I know that they're vital to our country"
"22819370","22826310"," and I know that what they're doing in the background is vital to our country because other people"
"22826310","22827710"," are doing it against us."
"22828990","22833930"," I want to know what's cheap for pauter and I think our pauter."
"22833930","22839030"," I think it's cheap at like 350, but it's very close to where it should be. "
"22840210","22841850"," I don't think it'll ever go bankrupt."
"22841850","22845510"," I think it's either going to get bought or I think it's going to get, I think it's either going"
"22845510","22850510"," to get bought by another company or it's going to find a bottom."
"22851750","22856210"," So I believe in an MA for them or I believe in it's near bottom. "
"22856950","22857810"," And it's so cheap."
"22858470","22863790"," I get people out there bitching about pauter and I'm like, yeah, you can buy that for $3 or $6."
"22864090","22865770"," You're out on fucking bent to it. "
"22867890","22869150"," It's about the price of it."
"22869230","22870450"," I'm like, yeah, I don't know."
"22871090","22872730"," I don't see bankruptcy for them. "
"22872830","22874770"," If they were to go near bankruptcy, they're going to get bought."
"22875570","22880290"," It'll never make it into, well, it might make it into bankruptcy for new share issuance."
"22882450","22887990"," In the previous shareholders get fucked, but what's, I mean, what $3 or $6 and it's something that"
"22887990","22890130"," you hold for like three, five, ten years. "
"22892570","22896150"," So I guess I'm just trying to value it from a, what makes it cheap."
"22900210","22901310"," Sometimes you can get fucked."
"22901730","22907170"," They'll go into, they'll pop a bankruptcy and then you'll see someone swoop in and they'll fuck you"
"22907170","22907750"," on those shares. "
"22909030","22917110"," But, you know, like 300, like 100 shares of Tesla at 100 versus 100 shares of Palantarot, you know,"
"22917310","22918910"," four bucks or five bucks or something."
"22920090","22926050"," And the other crazy part too is, you know, you can buy, you can sell puts, buy calls on it,"
"22926370","22928590"," or sell calls on it, all kinds of cool shit."
"22929030","22929290"," They're deep. "
"22931150","22931690"," I don't know."
"22932090","22933710"," There's ways for you to make money off it anyways."
"22935150","22939750"," And then I'm looking for, you know, we're almost there. "
"22941690","22943370"," Do this fucking website blows."
"22945050","22946490"," Fucking website is a disaster."
"22949490","22950850"," So I'm setting one right now. "
"22953490","22955910"," And they're still buying this dip right now too, man."
"22957530","22959650"," These fucking, these bots are buying this."
"22968060","22972560"," They're bought, this is all being bought by banks right now. "
"22972560","22973660"," There's buyers here, not sellers."
"22974760","22975940"," This is all getting scooped up."
"22995050","22998490"," Yeah, if I could buy for like three bucks, 350, but I don't mind trading it. "
"22998670","23002030"," If you're at a bottom and you want to see a rip on Palantarot, you know, we got a rip"
"23002030","23002370"," on it."
"23003250","23006650"," You know, I got some alerts set on it to buy it."
"23007590","23013610"," So I'm just looking for like, so I'm in this mode of like starting to reassess the stock market and"
"23013610","23017550"," look around and be like, yeah, can I hold some of this?"
"23017810","23018550"," Can I hold some of that?"
"23018930","23023510"," And it's a matter of buying for the next year or two. "
"23024470","23026450"," Looking for places to buy stuff."
"23026970","23030810"," You know, the thing is I did a post on that captain's alpha over the weekend, I think."
"23032110","23035950"," Or last week at some point, I don't remember when, but I made a post where I was like, you"
"23035950","23036930"," know, if you're looking at. "
"23037950","23043350"," There are some sectors within the stock market that are really sold off heavily in the past few"
"23043350","23044990"," years, like really sold off."
"23045670","23053110"," So you want to start looking inside of those sectors and saying, what is what stocks make up this"
"23053110","23053450"," sector?"
"23055290","23057410"," What's being accumulated right now?"
"23059450","23064950"," You know, just start researching and looking to see what's being accumulated and saying, you know,"
"23065450","23066550"," if they can start adding some stuff."
"23066550","23071310"," I'd like to start buying here a little bit more heavily this year. "
"23071690","23079610"," So, you know, if you're buying like a hundred of this and a hundred of that and you can fuck"
"23079610","23081290"," around on tickers, right?"
"23081510","23086070"," You can go in and sell shit and make money anyways."
"23089230","23091290"," So, you know, it's like, you know what it's like saying?"
"23091290","23094490"," It's like, let's say we were in, we were in November of 2020."
"23096270","23100270"," You know, you hear the same fucking people back then, you know, people back then were like, you"
"23100270","23101770"," shouldn't buy talent here here. "
"23102130","23103390"," I'm like, okay, yeah, I get that."
"23103810","23106910"," Or you shouldn't buy Tesla here or whatever stock it is, you what?"
"23107330","23109030"," I don't care what it is, Apple, name it."
"23110730","23116690"," That those people that were saying buy Tesla or Apple there, I was like, they're fucking crazy. "
"23117790","23118230"," Right?"
"23118450","23122210"," The people that were saying buy Tesla there or whatever, I thought they were fucking crazy."
"23123210","23128690"," So, like down here, I don't think it's crazy to be buying stock down here."
"23129490","23134010"," Even if we have like a crash, even if we're going to 3,000, I don't think it's bad because"
"23134010","23134910"," they're usually fast. "
"23135570","23140610"," We usually bounce back at some point soon, like month, three months, it's fast."
"23141510","23145810"," So, this is kind of like the place to start looking, start looking at companies that you think can"
"23145810","23149390"," make it or make it through any horrible shit we have."
"23152690","23158410"," And, you know, anything that's been a high fire for slightly, I'm bearish on oil right now. "
"23159390","23165050"," I'm overall bearish on oil, like for the next few years, I'm fucking bearish on oil."
"23165050","23172090"," I'm not looking to like, yeah, I'm going to accumulate oil so I can hold it five fucking years now,"
"23172210","23173030"," three years now."
"23173210","23177650"," So, it's like changing my viewpoint on accumulation. "
"23180450","23188790"," And I'm really looking at the point of the post that I made was, I remember when we were at"
"23188790","23193190"," the bottom in 2020 and I didn't fucking buy small caps."
"23193770","23196650"," And I was fucking pissed at myself."
"23197630","23202230"," In my mind, I was like, you know what, I can see tech going up. "
"23202510","23204450"," I can see stay at home stocks going up."
"23204910","23206870"," I can see the S&P trading sideways."
"23207930","23212670"," I can see all these companies, stay at home companies doing well. "
"23213350","23221350"," I could see drug companies doing well, traded those, but the one that I didn't see was small caps."
"23223250","23226190"," And had I bought fucking small caps, it would have been fine."
"23226570","23233470"," And what I realized or what got hammered into my head finally was that this is their fucking stock"
"23233470","23233910"," market. "
"23234270","23235810"," This is a bank stock market."
"23236070","23237550"," It's not our fucking stock market."
"23238110","23239090"," And they'll trade anything. "
"23240110","23246410"," They'll trade, if we had a nuclear war tomorrow, they'd be trading like tires for fuel, right?"
"23246410","23249230"," We couldn't mine oil anymore."
"23249230","23251610"," They'd be like, who's got a tire pit?"
"23251770","23253850"," We can start selling tires out of and put it out of market."
"23254470","23255070"," Does that make sense?"
"23255890","23260390"," So they're going to find a way to sell, buy and sell, especially oversold shit. "
"23260750","23264630"," And they don't care about, they don't care about what we think."
"23264930","23266090"," They don't care what you think."
"23266910","23273890"," And so when you saw how oversold small caps were and how everyone thought everyone then was like,"
"23273890","23275050"," there's no way small caps coming. "
"23275350","23276410"," There's all these zombie companies."
"23276890","23279730"," We have empty offices with one guy behind a phone."
"23280270","23285770"," We've got a one guy behind a phone and nobody's in the office. "
"23287770","23288390"," There's shortage."
"23288690","23289550"," He's got no product."
"23289790","23290190"," He's got nothing. "
"23290770","23291890"," There's no way that company's going up."
"23292010","23297010"," And sure enough, they traded that shit for, you know, they cranked it."
"23297690","23302590"," So what I'm looking at right now, I'm looking at, well, you know, part of a."
"23303390","23310110"," Or what's been, what's been sold down like, what's lost 60, 70, 80% of its value in an index"
"23310110","23310790"," that's lost. "
"23312230","23313790"," 48% of its value."
"23314950","23319490"," You know, this, this sub, this sector over here lost a total of 48% of its value."
"23319810","23323770"," And who got trashed in there and has a chance of making it. "
"23326920","23331720"," So, you know, like there's, there's, if you wanted something to do this spring."
"23332980","23333420"," Late winter."
"23333980","23337800"," It's to, it's to start looking at. "
"23339660","23345600"," These companies and saying, hmm, you know, I mean, what was palancer trading for at one point?"
"23345960","23347100"," It was like, was it 30?"
"23347900","23348400"," All right, remember."
"23356360","23357780"," 45 fucking dollars."
"23359300","23360340"," So Jesus. "
"23362460","23368000"," I think I remember when it, I think I remember when we went to 45 and it just, I remember"
"23368000","23368920"," when it would happen afterwards."
"23368920","23372800"," But I'm like, so for like $3 and 50 cents."
"23376280","23377620"," I'm like, yeah, there's a chance. "
"23380320","23381840"," Three 48 12 minutes up."
"23382120","23383240"," Still selling off into the clothes."
"23383520","23387000"," We're really, really close right now on the trigger to buy. "
"23388240","23389360"," Super close right now."
"23390120","23391280"," This could be a, this could be me."
"23391400","23395180"," I'm not beginning to get trashed in the last five minutes here, but we're pretty fucking close. "
"23397840","23400960"," The one problem down here is we might trade sideways in the overnight."
"23403780","23411060"," So you, uh, you don't want to be, uh, you don't want to be getting that data burn in here"
"23411060","23411340"," either."
"23411500","23412300"," So maybe a call spread. "
"23421290","23424030"," You know, like, let's say, let's say you have a chance to buy a pound."
"23424210","23425170"," The counter is a good example."
"23425170","23426530"," So let's say you have a canceled by a 350. "
"23426950","23431610"," We have a market crash and it goes to 150 and then slams back up to 350."
"23431610","23433370"," Then what am I in the loss for?"
"23433530","23433870"," Nothing."
"23434790","23435150"," Right?"
"23436750","23440270"," Like people are saying by pounds here where it's 45 bucks or 30 bucks or whatever. "
"23441310","23442930"," You know, and we're like, yeah, maybe not."
"23443590","23446730"," Maybe I'll buy it and hold it for a week or two or three weeks or a month."
"23447310","23448450"," But like, we're starting to get down here. "
"23448570","23453190"," It's like, are they going to stay at 350 for the next 10 years?"
"23454350","23456790"," Or are they going to become like a defensive stock in the next 10 years?"
"23461210","23462310"," Oh, it's right there."
"23462890","23465770"," A little while the coyote going on down here."
"23468610","23469010"," Patience. "
"23476840","23478500"," Hold on, John, we're almost there."
"23488270","23489190"," That might be it."
"23489350","23490870"," You see the little gray area that's still there?"
"23491610","23492830"," That might have been it right there, John. "
"23494390","23495210"," See it right there?"
"23496050","23496890"," A little more there."
"23497310","23498210"," We're coming back up again."
"23499270","23500370"," No, wait a minute, John. "
"23519520","23520520"," We're close, brother."
"23527560","23534320"," I know that's what I'm saying."
"23535880","23538260"," I'm like, can I just get this last fucking. "
"23539380","23540000"," It right here."
"23542500","23544960"," It's his last fucking five minute down."
"23546340","23547360"," Nine minutes. "
"23547700","23549400"," Just go down here for nine minutes."
"23564330","23577290"," I hate these fucking"
"23577290","23578030"," robots sometimes."
"23585530","23587090"," Look, well, there's a couple of things. "
"23587790","23589910"," I'm looking at 392s."
"23591970","23597530"," But if we go down to 3D, if we get on a 3D, I think on a 3D 6 or"
"23597530","23604170"," 5, man, you're going to get some juicy prices on like 390s and 388s."
"23604730","23605470"," I'm being patient. "
"23606230","23607670"," If I missed the trade, I missed the trade."
"23609270","23610250"," I want this right here."
"23610590","23611110"," This is what I want. "
"23611590","23613650"," Let's bring me down here so I can see what the price of calls are."
"23617630","23624830"," If you want to pick this trade up, you really need to see us the blue line here."
"23624910","23626530"," You want to see us trade above the blue line. "
"23627370","23628830"," Take it to take along there."
"23629690","23631210"," Otherwise, this is still in play."
"23635900","23637820"," I'm going to leave that up for you so you can see it. "
"23637860","23641300"," I'll leave it up so you can see what I'm saying to you."
"23650500","23651880"," It's so close right here."
"23651880","23657640"," If you wanted to get like a call for Friday, you could possibly do that. "
"23658000","23659440"," You have to have a stop loss from the 386."
"23660600","23663640"," If they sell 386, you pull the plug on it."
"23663760","23665220"," Matter of fact, you know how great trade is right here?"
"23665960","23667500"," Buy some fucking in the money calls. "
"23668440","23669220"," They're like a month out."
"23670080","23672100"," If we trade below 386, cut them loose."
"23672400","23674020"," You'll probably lose like 10% on them. "
"23675280","23676940"," That's a great fucking trade down here."
"23677620","23678560"," Just buy them a month out."
"23683720","23684620"," It's coming, right?"
"23684900","23685240"," You know it. "
"23685340","23686080"," You know it, John."
"23699560","23705040"," Well, you got to remember you've got the only real volatility this week is Thursday."
"23708560","23715200"," If you go back into the program, I gave a weekly update on our weekly update on what we took"
"23715200","23715920"," back this week. "
"23716860","23719920"," Bears are looking to get underneath 386 today or tomorrow."
"23720900","23726420"," If they can't get underneath 386 today or tomorrow in the open, this is a dip buy for bulls."
"23726940","23732240"," 388, 386 is a dip buy for continuation, at least into Wednesday at some point. "
"23740020","23742900"," Yeah, I want to see that last little fucking blood into the clothes here."
"23743780","23745160"," I don't know if we're getting it."
"23745280","23748100"," They're probably going to close it up here at some point. "
"23748820","23750040"," 354, you got six minutes left."
"23752420","23756260"," I haven't checked to see if we've moved up now at this point, but I think we have."
"23758320","23759940"," Give me the fucking blood, please. "
"23762770","23764090"," I hate when I have to do this."
"23769660","23771660"," 386, 67."
"23773560","23774300"," Right here. "
"23775900","23777240"," You want to see it right there."
"23777520","23777720"," Right there."
"23777840","23778780"," Watch that bar right there. "
"23782700","23784160"," Watch that green bar right there."
"23784920","23785400"," Trust me."
"23789500","23791180"," Just please go down there. "
"23792220","23794460"," I'm saying, trust me, watch us not go down there."
"23795160","23795860"," It's so close."
"23796060","23798940"," We were talking, were we talking here fucking a dollar?"
"23802260","23804960"," Just go down there for the last minute of the bell. "
"23805600","23807880"," I might have to watch this into 415 too."
"23808400","23810060"," So let's say we close right here."
"23811040","23811840"," It was 355. "
"23812340","23813080"," We've got five minutes left."
"23813320","23814200"," Let's say we close right here."
"23814340","23816100"," We could go down here until like 415. "
"23816980","23820340"," And you could actually buy this right here at like 412 or something."
"23821740","23824100"," So just stay tuned."
"23826140","23830800"," We actually have 20 minutes left to do this, so. "
"23835060","23837040"," I fucking hate trading at 415."
"23844530","23845310"," Come on."
"23849170","23850570"," Just cut it loose. "
"23852090","23853030"," Capitulate bulls."
"23853590","23854090"," Capitulate."
"23862350","23869750"," Yeah, if you put some time on them, if you put some time on some calls, and then you just"
"23869750","23871450"," have a stop loss at 386. "
"23873290","23874850"," It's a fair trade here."
"23875530","23876750"," It's not a bad trade."
"23880380","23882800"," There's no, or I shouldn't, no, not financial advice. "
"23883480","23884660"," Not financial advice."
"23884860","23885640"," Don't do what I'd say."
"23887940","23889280"," Not financial advice. "
"23892940","23896820"," But if you wanted like, if you don't want to deal with the last fucking 20 minutes to get the"
"23896820","23900440"," best absolute best price on something, I can understand."
"23904780","23906240"," You're not a cheap ass like me."
"23915810","23916410"," I do. "
"23916970","23921770"," I do a lot of, I do a lot of trade and sometimes at like the bell or at like"
"23921770","23922790"," 412 in the afternoon."
"23923250","23932630"," I'll be, I'll turn the, I'll turn this stream off."
"23932630","23936810"," And then I'll come on Twitter and be like, yeah, I just bought a bunch of calls or pull it"
"23936810","23937270"," or whatever. "
"23945120","23946860"," We're fucking close right here."

"24049750","24050370"," Yeah, yeah. "
"24050670","24053750"," We're trying where we got some work going on the bat."
"24053870","24054670"," You guys are going to be shocked."
"24055010","24059230"," So I can't talk about it right now, but. "
"24059230","24060070"," Okay."
"24060310","24061250"," So we're after the bell now."
"24061670","24063170"," I want you guys to have a wonderful afternoon. "
"24063270","24068690"," I want you guys to keep yourselves aware of down here to the 14th, 14th hour."
"24068790","24073610"," Look at that 386.60. See if they keep selling in the 15 minutes after the hour here."
"24073990","24076250"," You might be able to scoop something up down here. "
"24076330","24078190"," You see the robots are working in the background here."
"24079710","24083710"," If they can get deep enough into four, like 412, just be patient."
"24084350","24091750"," If they can get down to this 386.63, 386.64 or something, the last 15 minutes, they'll sneak some"
"24091750","24092350"," shit in there. "
"24096660","24098240"," You guys all have a wonderful afternoon."
"24099500","24100560"," I'll see you guys tomorrow."
"24101020","24103220"," Remember what I, if you guys, I'll leave this video up. "
"24103440","24109180"," So if you guys need to refer back to the weekly outlook or my outlook for tomorrow."
"24109180","24116000"," One thing I want to talk about that I said earlier was you'd expect them to sell futures above the"
"24116000","24116280"," pivot."
"24116940","24121200"," So now that we're close to this pivot, it should be a sideways trade into the open tomorrow. "
"24121840","24122980"," You shouldn't see too much."
"24123420","24127180"," You'll hear people on Twitter be like, oh, they're waiting for the result of J-POW."
"24127420","24128760"," That's not really what's going on. "
"24129260","24133960"," There's just dealers that are delta neutral at this point when we're down here."
"24134160","24134240"," Okay."
"24135820","24137200"," That's not what's really happening. "
"24138820","24143840"," So as we get closer to this, this pivot down here, they don't have to, they don't really have to"
"24143840","24144940"," take it to a different side of the trade."
"24146880","24148700"," So I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow."
"24149100","24152400"," I'm going to keep an eye on maybe grabbing some calls at 412. "
"24153600","24154320"," Sign up on the website."
"24154560","24158780"," It's captainjames.com and you guys get rolled into what's coming."
"24159100","24159600"," It's big. "
"24159860","24161420"," It's bigger than we thought it was."
"24165490","24166750"," You guys all take it easy."
"24166750","24169610"," Mr. Ren won't realize profits of a mean to contact you. "
"24169610","24171750"," There's a bunch of you out there that might be listening right now."
"24172050","24175890"," I've seen your DMs. I have not had a chance or a minute. "
"24176450","24176930"," Literally."
"24177110","24180930"," Some of the guys in the background know what I'm doing and I'm burning the candle."
"24181190","24188290"," Like I'm working 16, 18 hour days right now legitimately, like 16, 18 hour days in the background. "
