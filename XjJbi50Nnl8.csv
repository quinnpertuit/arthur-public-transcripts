"6730","7850"," Mike check, check one."
"10150","11210"," Check one."
"71750","74310"," We're not going to wait here for that. "
"74450","75490"," We're going to go straight into it."
"75890","79090"," So just notice here if you are on..."
"81090","90090"," If you are on calls from yesterday, let me exit it right in here on zero dates,"
"90090","93510"," but you've got this one right here."
"93510","97670"," It's pretty close here to this R2, 450, 87. "
"98910","105250"," If you are on zero dates in your directionally, if you're holding calls directionally from"
"105250","110810"," yesterday and today if you're buying that close yesterday, type of characters there, you actually"
"110810","120490"," remember the mechanics of what are now zero dates and what they could become the CEO to then be"
"120490","125750"," able to say that the two losing candidates, the rejected fine, will not feel heard and will not"
"125750","127210"," want to jump ship right away."
"127770","137850"," What they actually mean, right?"
"139010","146150"," We are close to this R2 and then over here we have the target that we had from yesterday for"
"146150","146530"," today."
"148230","150850"," Today and tomorrow, minimum of 452. "
"151790","155130"," We also have 455, I believe, for Friday."
"156330","159950"," We should get ball crush on CPI data."
"160110","160410"," Yes, sir. "
"160470","165330"," We talked about the downside moves in the marketplace."
"169930","176130"," And according to the statement Biden says the inflation data shows the US economy remains strong."
"178010","179130"," I think tight here. "
"179210","181170"," I've got a financial juice today."
"181210","186110"," It feels like being really high."
"186410","194290"," So just off of this open a few things for you to understand is you're going to get a ball"
"194290","204150"," crush on CPI data and you likely get a little bit of a bump from the expectations for tomorrow. "
"205330","213330"," Tomorrow we have on Friday, PPI, core PPI, PPI over here, or PPI over here, then of course consumer"
"213330","218570"," sentiments preliminary, which I think is actually going to be good."
"220750","223110"," Consumer sentiment should take up slightly."
"225130","229550"," And any of the reads on gas being high or shouldn't come out just yet. "
"231270","237350"," So there should be at least some ball crush off of Friday's anticipated news."
"240010","246430"," Now saying that we still have not had a legitimate retest of hourly trigger."
"246790","248750"," We had the retest down below here. "
"248910","250390"," This is good for the squeeze above."
"250910","256410"," So we tagged 480, I think in the discord this morning, I told them expect a tag of 480 and"
"256410","266270"," then expected us to go up on the bell as well."
"266270","268930"," And we're trading this R2 at 450, 87. "
"270970","273690"," There is a small gap to the downside."
"274610","280110"," And I mean, tiny, like super tiny down here on the pivot."
"280830","282230"," Can we come back there?"
"283110","283690"," Possible. "
"284910","286390"," 446, 64."
"287330","289310"," It's possible we can get down here."
"291870","295630"," Velocity is toppingish right now. "
"298090","300170"," But that ball crush can overrun that."
"300310","300810"," We know that right."
"300950","303090"," We can have some sustained a sustained move to the upside. "
"306670","309230"," Now with that said, let's take a look really quick."
"309450","311030"," We talked about this yesterday in stream."
"311930","315490"," To set up into the close yesterday, there's two fold. "
"316650","320350"," Someone wanted to pin the market the last half an hour."
"320670","325310"," I was in the options chain yesterday on zero dates."
"326490","331310"," And someone was slamming 800,000 calls for pennies. "
"334210","336470"," I believe 448."
"337570","339950"," And so much money."
"341030","343190"," It's a good morning, by the way. "
"343830","344810"," Good morning to you."
"344830","345910"," If you made money on that open."
"346910","353350"," If you traded any of this here or even here, there's a lot of money here. "
"353530","354550"," Some good money this morning."
"355390","357110"," Thanks for joining us, by the way."
"360250","361290"," There's two things that happened. "
"361490","370470"," In the close yesterday, someone a dealer or an entity of some kind was buying like 2 cent calls."
"371010","373710"," Like 7 cents and then down like 2 cents and 1."
"373910","375950"," So they just slamming them."
"377410","380290"," And so that was that was putting the market into the close. "
"380490","381750"," We ended up rolling down into the bell."
"383110","386130"," But there's one other argument that was made into that belly yesterday."
"386670","388490"," And that was we're coming up now to 457. "
"391090","399090"," And someone in the chat yesterday said to me, no you worry about the report tomorrow."
"400070","402430"," And so I had to draw for them."
"402610","408750"," I had to draw for them who actually had to worry, right?"
"410030","410990"," It's not. "
"410990","412570"," It's not the bulls."
"413090","415170"," The setup there is for bears."
"416410","420810"," They needed a very hot CPI report. "
"421190","429710"," Can't trade down into the close of like that severely over the past few weeks."
"429930","436070"," Can't trade Apple down to 174 and then think that you're going to get."
"438210","440470"," They mild CPI report. "
"441010","448030"," And expect Apple to drop another, you know, 50 points or 25 points or 10 points or 5 points."
"448670","450010"," It's not going to happen."
"450610","454550"," You just had to pull back on Apple to 177. "
"455690","456350"," It's close enough."
"457030","459830"," Maybe a pullback to 174, another $3 or something."
"460650","466170"," It's so close down there that you're seeing a rotation in the market. "
"466390","467690"," You're not seeing distribution."
"469590","474210"," How you know that is because the S&P 500 is holding up."
"474790","479990"," You're seeing some of the main drivers of the market having decent pullbacks. "
"480450","482410"," Apple specifically had a correction."
"482930","484270"," The S&P did not."
"485210","493650"," And you're seeing that money enter other sectors in the stock market holding up the S&P 500. "
"494270","500410"," That includes, believe it or not, oil and gas are part of the S&P 500."
"501710","505470"," Meanwhile, you see Apple come down to 177 bucks."
"506050","514350"," We discussed multitude of times that 174 is a great buy, dip buy for bulls. "
"515490","520850"," Bulls out there want to buy, not Tesla, Apple at 174 at 177."
"522789","523950"," It's a no brainer."
"524590","526250"," It's a no fucking brainer. "
"526310","527870"," You buy it at 174 bucks, 177."
"529450","533630"," It doesn't even matter if it goes down to 174 because it's not done going up."
"533630","536150"," This summer is not over. "
"538410","539870"," And we are going up."
"541290","545650"," So there is some corrective action going on the stock market, but not the S&P 500."
"546050","551890"," As a matter of fact, resilience of the S&P 500 is real. "
"552230","554050"," It's a real thing."
"554970","557150"," It's always real, always has been."
"558050","565930"," Now S&P might not outperform like a tech stock might outperform, but on times like this, the S&P"
"565930","568490"," 500 is holding up quite nicely, isn't it?"
"569130","575210"," You should pay attention and take note of that as well, that the S&P 500 does that. "
"578090","591440"," It does hold up, have more resilience than individual"
"591440","594240"," tickers, the volatility associated with individual tickers."
"594240","595140"," We have a new high."
"595700","596940"," Look at that right here. "
"597440","598740"," New high just now."
"599860","604660"," We also stated that we always put in our targets, right?"
"604820","605660"," There's one right there."
"606320","607460"," Here's this one from yesterday. "
"608340","611300"," And this is our next target above, 45221."
"612800","613800"," Now I'm still in spreads."
"614120","616540"," I didn't get out of anything that was directionally challenged. "
"617900","620300"," I'm a fan of taking the money and running, realizing profit."
"620300","625770"," I was loading the boat down here yesterday."
"626150","631050"," I did take some of the money off yesterday, some of my exposure, but I did leave some on and"
"631050","634130"," I made outstanding money on this trade today. "
"634350","636090"," So I took it right there."
"636390","638370"," I'm plenty of cash for me."
"639710","641150"," The FOMO is kicking in. "
"641270","642330"," The event ball is cool enough."
"642550","643590"," We're burning up right now."
"643950","644930"," Trying to blast even higher. "
"645770","647050"," We're going to trade next."
"647050","650850"," I think that gave this target inside of Discord this morning."
"651510","653330"," Price target of 45221. "
"654170","657950"," And I also gave this target yesterday before the bell."
"659730","664750"," Now trading 45122 to that R3 above."
"665810","667950"," We know where this purple lines mean, right?"
"668190","669210"," This is where the sellers are. "
"670180","675730"," We are trading above all the way back right now to August 7th."
"676830","682790"," And we have this Valhalla moment up here, this failure above."
"683270","687790"," This is also R3 target of 45259. "
"688230","691190"," And then this 45290 up here above."
"691450","699190"," Look at that beautiful squeeze."
"699190","702750"," One, two, three, four, five. "
"704050","704730"," Erased."
"705950","708090"," Gone, gone, gone, baby."
"709010","710270"," Gone, gone, gone. "
"710870","712650"," Giant gap up here."
"713050","714230"," This is a gap."
"716130","720990"," You've got the R3 target above up here, PT45221. "
"721310","727310"," I want you to know that there's going to be vol up in here."
"729790","732930"," Sellers right here, they're going to want to sell down on you again right here."
"734130","735590"," You've got one more day. "
"736930","740730"," We're lined up here and start to knock all this stuff back out again."
"741810","742910"," Do I think we get up there?"
"748050","749010"," Oh boy."
"750570","753190"," Now let's just talk about something here. "
"753630","754890"," This hourly trigger."
"756050","757510"," We talk about this."
"757510","759450"," I talk about it in stream every day. "
"761070","764250"," And we have not had a successful retest of it."
"764690","768010"," We are looking for that still even with this squeeze."
"769450","776450"," No matter where we go to the upside, you want to see it come back and get a successful retest"
"776450","778610"," for the big power move to the upside. "
"780270","782890"," Just right now we were talking not we."
"783270","784470"," Definitely not we."
"784870","792410"," We were talking about a market crash in the chat just a few like yesterday, day before day before. "
"793010","793750"," Ready?"
"794370","797070"," We're writing conversation in the chat every day."
"797290","805630"," Market crash, market crash, market crash, market crash, market"
"805630","807810"," crash."
"810470","813050"," You know what Captain was saying up here?"
"814230","816270"," Don't worry if you wake up one day. "
"816310","817570"," We start correcting."
"818350","819990"," It's not over though."
"820470","821590"," We're not done here. "
"822410","823170"," Don't panic."
"823510","824770"," But guess what turned in here?"
"824890","826010"," Guess it overrode the chat."
"826630","827650"," Market crash talk. "
"829670","830190"," Okay."
"831030","834050"," Trading 451.48 right now."
"835690","845770"," Low's not seen since August 1st on Thursday, August"
"845770","846810"," 10th. "
"854710","858210"," Everybody here this morning?"
"858210","860430"," That looks a little light right now."
"860430","862490"," Looks like half the taps missing this morning."
"863910","865230"," I show up every day. "
"865850","867850"," Show up when it's green, show up when it's red."
"868710","870230"," Where is everybody this morning?"
"870310","872110"," You guys going to wake everybody up this morning?"
"872430","873250"," Find out if they're okay?"
"879190","883790"," Yes, yes, yes, yes."
"883790","886510"," You guys on call spreads right now too?"
"886730","888910"," Call spreads looking pretty fucking good right now. "
"894850","896910"," You guys want to buy calls here?"
"899330","901090"," Didn't like them down here, did you?"
"902510","903830"," Didn't like them down here."
"904010","905390"," Didn't like buying them right here."
"905470","907530"," Didn't like DACA and right there. "
"907770","909230"," Want to buy them right here though, right?"
"911790","913270"," Get out and do your part."
"915150","916830"," No, I don't think it's better."
"921610","923150"," Turn tables turn. "
"925690","932230"," Turn tables turn."
"938640","941020"," Look, Matt, what are you doing, Betty?"
"941220","946720"," I got to have a talk with you guys though now."
"949200","951260"," I have to leave you today. "
"952780","959820"," I have to leave you today because the website is launching and we're going to leave the stream on."
"959820","962860"," I thought you know that this take was really interesting on surveillance."
"963240","968020"," I'm going to leave the stream and I'll stop back in it at sign posts and stuff. "
"969180","971140"," I'm getting yelled at right now."
"971460","973320"," I've got people in the background yelling at me."
"973400","976780"," I've got the smart people yelling at me. "
"977260","978120"," They were yelling at me yesterday."
"978400","979220"," They were like, no, dude."
"979540","981220"," They're like, we're at that point where we need you. "
"981500","981820"," I'm like, okay."
"982540","988240"," Just so you can see there's some supply up here."
"988240","991100"," Right there, got a little bit more push above here. "
"992720","995660"," You got some secret levels somewhere maybe up there."
"995840","997320"," You can see it all up there, right?"
"997520","1000380"," Oh, what's that up there?"
"1009800","1010600"," I'm glad"
"1010600","1020480"," I got"
"1020480","1022960"," talked out of that trade because glad I took it early."
"1023160","1024300"," Yeah, at least I got paid. "
"1024480","1028700"," Should have bought it for my kids back down at any five though and just done it."
"1029560","1030359"," I'm glad I got talked out of that trade."
"1034319","1036900"," Just held there the leaps that I was originally considering. "
"1038760","1039920"," So much doom."
"1042980","1051700"," 451's trade to $1.24. Those are trading like, I think I had those for like, I had like 41s,"
"1051780","1057940"," 42s, 45s, 41s were like fucking garbage yesterday."
"1058660","1059880"," That bell closed. "
"1060100","1065440"," I'm like on that bottom tick going by, by, by, by, by, by Friday shit."
"1067520","1070740"," It's like buying at one point yesterday in that close."
"1071020","1071840"," I was, I kid you not. "
"1072720","1075620"," I kid you not at one point yesterday in that close, right?"
"1076500","1078780"," That bottom tick down below, right?"
"1078960","1080620"," I was the one minute tick down there."
"1080740","1085420"," I was like slamming buys and it was just like, no, I want some more."
"1085420","1086280"," Now I want some more. "
"1086320","1090400"," Then I was like, if it rolls over one more time into the actual close, I'm like, just do it"
"1090400","1092240"," so I can just add even more right here."
"1092480","1096160"," What's the whole deal with tapestry and what's pretty good?"
"1096320","1097060"," Just going to join us later."
"1097280","1098440"," Oh boy. "
"1098580","1102460"," And she says, basically, consolidation is a thing."
"1104280","1105140"," I will say tapestry."
"1105140","1105860"," What else we got here?"
"1106040","1106480"," Main screen. "
"1109080","1109720"," Heat map."
"1111660","1112840"," Risk on day."
"1113020","1114240"," Today all green everywhere. "
"1115660","1116640"," Ocean of green."
"1117360","1122140"," This is the daily performance for our performance."
"1122880","1125080"," The one hour performance right here. "
"1126880","1128520"," Lily down this morning."
"1129980","1131040"," So pretty good."
"1133280","1134880"," We're going to talk about somebody. "
"1135060","1139440"," We're talking about CPI and PPI when it's going to matter."
"1142340","1143640"," What's really going to matter."
"1143960","1145440"," Now I want you guys to understand something. "
"1145580","1147900"," So these conversations we have about wages."
"1150800","1155220"," Now we've been talking about this and trying to layer it over the past week or two."
"1156340","1163020"," And we're going to actually roll that into inflation that comes back to where it's ugly down the"
"1163020","1163860"," road. "
"1165640","1167360"," And what that's going to mean."
"1168220","1169360"," The bounce in inflation."
"1170420","1171780"," Well that sort of stuff. "
"1171960","1173660"," How that plays out in the longer term."
"1175780","1176380"," Spy."
"1177300","1180540"," Doesn't that seem like out of reach for most people?"
"1180920","1182000"," The high of 4170. "
"1184540","1186880"," If I'm going into the office."
"1186880","1188500"," Pretty close up here right."
"1188620","1189180"," That are three. "
"1191880","1196700"," I mean I get that there are people who just don't lose your senses."
"1197340","1198600"," Just like usual."
"1201460","1206540"," As long as price stays above the 6 CMA or defends this for 5076. "
"1208700","1209780"," Same usual targets."
"1210140","1213140"," No reason to sell longs here if you're long the market right now."
"1213140","1216240"," I'm not selling a pretty substantial position here. "
"1217460","1217940"," Spreads."
"1219320","1221480"," So there's no reason to sell long."
"1221680","1224080"," Unless you like to actually challenge in zero days or something. "
"1224520","1226000"," You want to take the money and run."
"1226260","1228400"," You're in one day yesterday and I was there today."
"1228500","1229360"," I understand that. "
"1229560","1230380"," I took a bunch of money."
"1230380","1231560"," I've made great money."
"1235180","1237860"," You've got same same things as usual right. "
"1238100","1239380"," Keep trading up until it fails."
"1239380","1242160"," We'll come back down and test the 2070MA."
"1242220","1245000"," You've got another test down below on the 449-34. "
"1246500","1248000"," If you want that one."
"1248760","1251140"," Nice beautiful day today coming up to trade R3."
"1252960","1256220"," I remember what I say about squeezes. "
"1256480","1258140"," Big clusters like this."
"1258360","1259480"," We've slammed it all the way up."
"1259700","1260640"," They come right back down. "
"1261880","1264320"," We will return at some point to the scene."
"1264540","1265860"," Not to say the crime but the hourly trigger."
"1265860","1268040"," We'll test this at some point. "
"1269340","1273060"," I think the five minute basis right now."
"1273100","1274600"," We have a nice big extension here."
"1275920","1276980"," 15 minutes. "
"1279320","1280280"," Giant bull."
"1280780","1284400"," I've got a big bull cross and a 15 minute plus."
"1284580","1285880"," We've got a giant cluster down here. "
"1286060","1290080"," Daily HT-15 as well."
"1290620","1291960"," The hourly."
"1293540","1295320"," I want you to see this here. "
"1295500","1298720"," I want you specifically to pay attention to this."
"1299980","1301780"," You're looking for a trend."
"1302320","1302740"," Change. "
"1303080","1303680"," Change of trend."
"1304360","1305160"," You're at home right now."
"1305280","1309880"," If you're at home right now. "
"1310000","1311700"," We're going to switch over to a full screen chart."
"1312380","1314280"," I want you to see this."
"1316640","1318480"," We'll just do it in SPX right here. "
"1319280","1321000"," We'll come right back and show it on spot."
"1321240","1322720"," I want to keep it clean for you."
"1323100","1328160"," I just want you to see the SPX on a one hour chart. "
"1329100","1331100"," I just want you to see this here."
"1331300","1332900"," What's shaping up?"
"1333400","1335160"," This is SPX on an hourly."
"1336220","1337080"," 27 EMA. "
"1338600","1340540"," Blattening of the 129 EMA."
"1340780","1342580"," Price above the 129 EMA."
"1343280","1344260"," Follow my cursor here. "
"1344260","1348560"," You're watching the turning up of the 27 EMA right here."
"1349520","1350760"," Watch that right there."
"1351880","1354900"," You're going to see this red one come across right here. "
"1356980","1363420"," You're going to be looking for either a pullback and consolidation here for that trade higher to"
"1363420","1364180"," close that gap."
"1364420","1366560"," They want to do them at the same rate that they have."
"1366760","1367460"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1367920","1371900"," Or you end up seeing just this push where we close this gap. "
"1372680","1377200"," Come back down and retest this right here."
"1378260","1381920"," But we do have the signs."
"1383840","1386120"," I want you to remember this if you're a bear. "
"1386560","1388460"," I don't care about the bulls."
"1388780","1389420"," They're always late."
"1389640","1390700"," They're always bind tops. "
"1394040","1400400"," There is an unconfirmed week to three week trend change."
"1401060","1402220"," Staping up right now."
"1402320","1404600"," I want you to see that, OK?"
"1406700","1408640"," One to three week trend change. "
"1408800","1411740"," I want you to see it there, OK?"
"1413860","1418580"," Right now it's only a 15 minute, which is one to three days, right?"
"1419380","1420220"," Maybe five."
"1421060","1422060"," See it right there."
"1423220","1424500"," Here's the 15 minute. "
"1424660","1427460"," This is a weekly, right?"
"1427460","1430620"," Needs to confirm the 15 minute to the downside right here."
"1430820","1433860"," That target is 450, 045."
"1434260","1434740"," Do you see that?"
"1436140","1442780"," Bulls want to see that confirmation for continuation for about three days, not one. "
"1443120","1445940"," It's like five minutes like one to three days."
"1446240","1448420"," 15 minute is like three to five."
"1449560","1454600"," One hour chart is one week to three weeks. "
"1456020","1462240"," So just so you're aware of this, if you're a bear seller out there, that there is a reversal in"
"1462240","1464940"," progress right now."
"1466100","1470500"," So if you are short, you had a chance of 448 to get out."
"1470940","1472460"," Put that on discord this morning. "
"1473560","1480660"," Your next chance to get out is likely going to be on SPX."
"1483460","1484340"," 45, 0495."
"1485280","1488680"," You're looking for a second chance to exit short. "
"1489960","1491560"," You may have one more chance."
"1493520","1495680"," We're going to show this on SPY right now."
"1495960","1500960"," I know the chart, SPY chart is kind of messy, but at least on a 15 minute. "
"1503200","1505660"," You may get one more chance back here."
"1505780","1508280"," You can see here in the 15 minute, you might get one more chance."
"1510220","1515580"," You might get one more chance on SPY, but I doubt it. "
"1515580","1516680"," We're on SPY at least."
"1519740","1523320"," If it does roll back down here, you're going to hope for."
"1528220","1536700"," Maybe 449.05. Maybe to get out, you're going to see a reversal right here to the upside. "
"1536700","1537600"," You see it?"
"1538140","1539620"," I'm going to see that right there."
"1540280","1541760"," Let me show it better."
"1542060","1544660"," Let me just make this clear for you so you can at least see it. "
"1544860","1546880"," With the writers and the actors, you're so involved."
"1547040","1548100"," I'm a fierce south side."
"1548240","1549680"," The advertising side of the business. "
"1550100","1551620"," Here's the red line right here."
"1551820","1554200"," What's your take on the straight line?"
"1554200","1555180"," There's the white line right?"
"1555300","1556500"," It's a one hour chart, OK?"
"1556740","1557320"," Really entrenched."
"1558420","1558460"," Yeah. "
"1559260","1565280"," Well, I think you'll be lucky if you get anything that was already in motion."
"1565280","1565720"," Dammit."
"1565780","1566360"," Hold on here. "
"1568200","1570180"," You haven't exited short yet."
"1571940","1576460"," You're going to be given a few more months before literally."
"1576600","1577460"," Dammit, seriously. "
"1580120","1582120"," One hour trend reversal."
"1584440","1587720"," You'll be lucky if you get a pullback down here."
"1588320","1590180"," All the way down to here. "
"1590840","1593240"," It's about 449.05 or so."
"1595180","1597900"," Expectation would be that we only bounce right here."
"1598220","1604900"," That's 450.21. We begin to get green bars for confirmed trend change. "
"1605580","1607460"," Sirely trigger will come up as well."
"1608240","1610000"," That hourly trigger will wind up right here."
"1612300","1615040"," And you would see a bounce down here. "
"1615840","1616760"," Or a bounce even up here."
"1617600","1623500"," And then just some continuation, consolidation and continuation to an actual trend reversal."
"1624720","1628200"," And this would actually take us back to a return. "
"1630860","1631460"," Return."
"1633420","1635600"," This year is running all time highs again."
"1635820","1637260"," Probably a failure right before, but. "
"1638400","1638700"," Yeah."
"1639180","1641040"," And so I mean that again."
"1641340","1646660"," So the correction around the market on individual tickers looks like it's complete right now. "
"1647480","1651720"," Steps are being taken right now for a major trend reversal in the market here."
"1653460","1654660"," Still unconfirmed."
"1655460","1658160"," On the 15 one hour, but it's there. "
"1658460","1659760"," So if you're a bear."
"1661320","1662360"," You've been warned."
"1663580","1664180"," Okay. "
"1665440","1668820"," You get some targets down here somewhere in this vicinity."
"1670220","1673360"," We're going to find out if the buyers are still here, right?"
"1673360","1676340"," The economic environment is kind of uncertain here."
"1677340","1678820"," It's a one minute chart right here. "
"1679040","1680980"," So basically you want to be looking for something down here."
"1681140","1686380"," If you're a performance at some point today, tomorrow, I don't care today."
"1686460","1686980"," It's Friday. "
"1687320","1688240"," I don't care where it is."
"1688340","1692240"," But somewhere down in here, you're going to be looking just checking to make sure that all this is"
"1692240","1693000"," real down here."
"1693540","1696320"," If you're a bull and you missed out on any of this. "
"1697420","1699520"," Hopefully you get an opportunity to trade all this."
"1699740","1701240"," You can pause this program right now."
"1701240","1702580"," Go back and look at this stuff. "
"1703800","1709840"," Draw your own little support lines and see if you can chase it or catch a ride on the way"
"1709840","1710060"," up."
"1710240","1714100"," As of right now, the move is still the upside."
"1715680","1717380"," So there's no like what we haven't pulled. "
"1717520","1717700"," We're not."
"1717740","1718720"," This isn't a pullback yet."
"1718900","1720060"," Just so you know, like right here. "
"1720260","1723820"," We're just checking the five minute, the one minute."
"1723940","1724480"," Excuse me."
"1725760","1727440"," So we're not done going up. "
"1730320","1734280"," They're still buying a dip next target above 45221."
"1738460","1742940"," But there is a trend reversal building in the background on higher time frames."
"1743100","1743200"," Okay. "
"1743300","1744180"," I want you to realize that."
"1746820","1748860"," Oh, boy, baby."
"1749700","1750240"," Yes. "
"1751340","1751880"," I mean, I."
"1752440","1754220"," Return to the scene of the crime."
"1757100","1758460"," Turn to the scene of crime."
"1760980","1769660"," I guess wealthy, you know, suburban moms or also kind of like it's been seen as. "
"1769820","1769980"," Okay."
"1770060","1771700"," I got to monetize this video."
"1771700","1772800"," I haven't monetized anything. "
"1776340","1780540"," To me, it's a huge, a huge competitor to Range Rover."
"1780840","1781360"," Yeah, it's interesting."
"1781760","1783160"," I'm going to find out what Mark D drives. "
"1783980","1785720"," I think the chat's open right now."
"1785860","1787740"," Two is a bunch of stuff I got to do in the background here."
"1788980","1791000"," Well, they could lease the YouTube chat is open. "
"1792180","1794420"," And it's on top chat, not live chat."
"1794640","1796280"," And I'm just not sure."
"1796840","1797700"," Kind of where the band is. "
"1797700","1799820"," I guess that's one of the first question I asked."
"1800160","1803200"," You know, after people bought the Hummer, the earlier doctors see here."
"1803840","1804800"," We're not more coming up. "
"1805400","1807420"," This sort by newest."
"1812780","1813260"," Customization."
"1813340","1814720"," So good morning to all of you out there. "
"1814980","1816260"," So there's a warning to you."
"1816780","1818360"," You had the warning video."
"1818900","1821800"," You had the warning video on Sunday two weeks ago. "
"1822320","1825200"," You're getting a new warning video today."
"1825560","1826600"," Well, this isn't a warning video."
"1826600","1831480"," You're getting an update warning that there's a potential reversal in progress. "
"1832000","1834960"," So just needs to be confirmed."
"1839020","1841140"," We bought that reversal yesterday."
"1842760","1844540"," I was always also told yesterday. "
"1844880","1846860"," Never place a trade before CPI."
"1847480","1847960"," Well, I did."
"1848460","1851460"," There you go. "
"1851460","1852340"," I did."
"1853440","1856020"," I will say this."
"1856240","1859800"," If we were if we had traded up into CPI, I'd be like, Oh, fuck that. "
"1859940","1861480"," I ain't doing shit until CPI."
"1863020","1865800"," You had you needed so much too."
"1866000","1869120"," You needed like you needed like the worst CPI prints. "
"1869300","1877220"," You need like hottest fuck need like $800 degree coal fired oven CPI prints to the upside."
"1877220","1882900"," And it underscores the company's drive to make it screaming business profitable by September of"
"1882900","1883440"," 2024."
"1883520","1884500"," Thanks, Charlie. "
"1884740","1887440"," Business stock is now up more than one and a quarter percent."
"1887440","1890460"," And meta is looking now to rehire many people."
"1890460","1892060"," It laid off several months ago. "
"1892700","1895840"," Oh, still not printing TMF for me, though."
"1896920","1899340"," Those layoffs are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg."
"1899700","1900740"," Oh, TMF. "
"1900800","1904040"," I just tried to hold them into a hold them into Friday."
"1904160","1906420"," They probably don't want to print them, do they?"
"1906460","1908160"," The company's stories were following this hour."
"1908440","1909220"," I'm Steve Rappaport. "
"1909360","1913220"," Up $5 up 1.16 percent."
"1914680","1927740"," A little bit"
"1927740","1929800"," of a break right now on R2."
"1943680","1946160"," No, if they're cheap, they cost me nothing. "
"1947460","1949280"," The spread on them was stupid."
"1953180","1956680"," Like the spread was so stupid on them that I was like, yeah, they're like that."
"1956940","1958000"," It's like trading degas. "
"1958420","1959740"," They either hit or they don't."
"1960480","1962520"," You're going to print 500 percent or they're going to zero."
"1962740","1966660"," It's not like an investment or anything like that. "
"1967300","1968320"," It's more of a gamble."
"1968580","1973940"," I had them print, I traded them three or four days ago and they printed for me."
"1974260","1977060"," Well, they're still free trade for me. "
"1977480","1980560"," So I just expect them to like expect them to go to the moon."
"1981480","1984000"," Like there's no expectation that they."
"1987320","1988380"," Well, I don't know. "
"1988460","1991060"," Maybe if you don't know anything about trading gas."
"1993520","1996720"," You're like you're you're trading it knowing that it's going to zero."
"1997060","2002340"," There's never an expectation that it's a winning philosophy or winning. "
"2002980","2003620"," All right."
"2003760","2004620"," We call my money on gas."
"2005000","2010480"," Like anyway, it says that probably like one out of 100 gas traders can say that. "
"2010640","2011560"," Stay make that statement."
"2013920","2016060"," That's they call it the window maker for a reason."
"2016240","2021040"," So what oftentimes it happens is, you trade it and you think it's. "
"2021040","2022900"," Like something that's sustainable that you do."
"2024260","2028480"," So the idea here would be if it's going to print 500 percent, I should probably and I've already"
"2028480","2028940"," won one."
"2029140","2033140"," So probably make that trade two or three times and it'll still print for me. "
"2037520","2041460"," I think when they caught the window maker because I think people like win it once."
"2041720","2043760"," Like somebody tells me I'd buy this shit."
"2044360","2048300"," And so they went at once and then what they do is they think that's like a strategy to win"
"2048300","2048719"," the market. "
"2048960","2049320"," It's not."
"2049320","2050679"," It's like pure gambling."
"2051000","2051860"," It's not pure gambling. "
"2051860","2053040"," It's actually better odds."
"2054400","2060920"," Most of the stock market is better odds than anything in Vegas and anything in a lottery."
"2061400","2065199"," So when they say it's gambling, I'm like, that's not it's not really gambling. "
"2065199","2070960"," I'm like gambling is pretty fucking pretty much even when you're counting."
"2071260","2076620"," I guess if you're not cards, but when you even somebody's counting cards, it's not really a game at"
"2076620","2077940"," that point or even fun or anything."
"2081060","2083040"," It's still kind of cheating concards. "
"2083340","2089100"," It's still kind of cheating and usually someone has to like get with you and tell you what's going"
"2089100","2089320"," on."
"2090320","2091420"," Like pure gambling."
"2092139","2094699"," I would say it's not exactly pure gambling. "
"2095080","2101240"," Like this people out there that's also say shit like some of them are saying like can't predict the"
"2101240","2101720"," stock market."
"2101860","2103100"," I'm like, that's a fucking lie too."
"2103440","2106120"," There's a lot of like there's a lot of things said about the stock market. "
"2107160","2111860"," They have some basis in truth, but aren't absolute truths either."
"2116180","2122760"," So we're going to revisit this conversation, this market crash conversation because we ain't done"
"2122760","2123440"," here in my view."
"2125200","2129280"," And whether this is that was the top and this is the crash and all this other nonsense. "
"2130020","2131640"," I don't think you've seen the end of it yet."
"2131760","2133580"," I don't think you've seen the end of it until September."
"2135100","2144640"," And even then that pullback will most likely be a some kind of a I don't think like the I"
"2144640","2147900"," think it's going to be more like speck growth will get hit that kind of stuff. "
"2147940","2150520"," You'll start to exit speck growth."
"2150800","2153760"," The indexes will probably fine into end of year."
"2154080","2159880"," Let me major pullback, but they'll be fine issue until end of year. "
"2159880","2166340"," And that's where I'm going to shift to is I'm going to shift into more of a conservative bullish"
"2166340","2173820"," approach into end of year and then look for a major pullback and beginning of the year."
"2175740","2180900"," This probably a good probably a place for bears."
"2181440","2187860"," If you're a bear seller out there, if this holds, there is probably a place for you. "
"2189100","2195220"," You place another correction trade on how you structure it."
"2195260","2202240"," If it's a put spread or to put back spread, maybe put like November December on it November"
"2202240","2202700"," December."
"2204500","2213040"," And then but target major correction in middle of September would be the point to that. "
"2213040","2215080"," Middle of September, middle of October."
"2217440","2220380"," And you'll probably have that ability to do that."
"2220680","2222940"," Once we go back and I think we're going back. "
"2223600","2227060"," My thesis is that we're going back for way higher highs."
"2227860","2233080"," But in a minimum, you could probably start that trade and the return of the scene of the crime."
"2233400","2234320"," Like I want to end that early. "
"2234880","2235560"," I don't believe you cap."
"2236420","2236960"," I'm going to fade you."
"2237000","2238100"," And I think that was the top. "
"2238100","2246440"," You'll likely still get a chance to revisit the previous yearly all time high."
"2246700","2250180"," To put that thesis to test."
"2251400","2256620"," If you do that, even if we continue higher, the way to trade that too, or my view would be. "
"2258580","2259760"," My view on that trade."
"2260020","2262560"," So if you're a seller here, if you're a seller and you're listening right now."
"2263860","2265580"," So I do this for bulls too. "
"2265680","2266860"," I did this for bulls two weeks ago."
"2267060","2269220"," So I'm going to do it for sellers now."
"2270060","2271560"," If you're a sell side. "
"2274460","2278080"," And you do think that was top still, that's still your thesis."
"2284380","2288560"," That's still your thesis, which I don't believe you."
"2289180","2294480"," But if you think that it is, as we come up here to close this gap above. "
"2296320","2299160"," This gap right here, this giant fucking gap you left behind."
"2299320","2302880"," Yeah, I know you want to close that gap."
"2303040","2304360"," I know I know. "
"2307860","2310280"," Let's just say we go back down here, right?"
"2310680","2313620"," To retest and boom, we have that one last low."
"2314340","2315140"," Okay, you won."
"2316140","2317660"," Still, I would say to you. "
"2317660","2319020"," They would define themselves as a luxury."
"2319020","2320220"," We're going back up here."
"2320400","2320460"," Okay. "
"2321760","2328480"," So that big trade that you're looking for, that big corrective trade that you're looking for, like"
"2328480","2330040"," a putback spread right here."
"2331300","2333440"," Regardless if we go here right now."
"2334080","2337800"," Regardless if we bounce right here and head higher, it doesn't matter. "
"2337860","2338580"," It doesn't matter if it's here."
"2340180","2343480"," It doesn't matter if it's straight up, bounced here or bounced here."
"2343740","2346280"," That trade will be there for you. "
"2346280","2350240"," I believe in my view, you're going to get that chance."
"2350600","2353340"," And that's even if we get continuation of the upside."
"2355480","2358260"," If we knock out those previous highs or not. "
"2358380","2361640"," If we, if we, if we fail the previous high for September, October."
"2362540","2365940"," I don't think we get the new high until January one."
"2367020","2370860"," But if we do get that previous high from 2022. "
"2371880","2373280"," Into September, October."
"2375600","2380420"," I would still take the, I would still take the, the middle of Manhattan."
"2381320","2382400"," Put back spread. "
"2382760","2384700"," That's a, that's not a putback spread."
"2384820","2386640"," If you don't know what that is, look it up on your own, go to YouTube."
"2387300","2389720"," Option industry, industry council will explain it to you. "
"2390240","2392520"," What that will do is it'll give you the time to."
"2394340","2398620"," For the market, if it does go up a little bit and then roll into September."
"2399720","2406280"," To clean this one out and more than likely that will go even lower will go way down here. "
"2407180","2409560"," So there's a nice putback spread trade here."
"2409640","2413760"," This is my point that there is one there for you."
"2413880","2420220"," So if you're looking for that trade, I would set an alert up here at a 45 80. "
"2421440","2426800"," I don't know if we hit it this week, next week or if it's in three weeks."
"2426800","2432060"," I don't know if we come back down to test the early trigger and we actually close that gap down"
"2432060","2432260"," below."
"2433100","2434400"," I don't care either. "
"2434620","2435360"," And you shouldn't either."
"2435520","2436820"," You should just have an alert at home."
"2438160","2439200"," That's like 448. "
"2439900","2443440"," No, excuse me, 458 zero on SBX."
"2443880","2446000"," Set alert that sends it to your phone or an email."
"2448440","2456740"," If that, if we tag that, you start trying to build a trade that maybe ends in December and you're"
"2456740","2458980"," going to close it in September, October. "
"2459360","2460980"," Maybe even farther out, January."
"2462500","2463520"," Something like that."
"2465300","2469040"," So just for you, if you're a seller, be aware of it. "
"2469040","2469180"," Okay."
"2471720","2472540"," I'm begging you."
"2472960","2473860"," I'm not trying to hurt you. "
"2473980","2474380"," Trying to help you."
"2474520","2474580"," So."
"2478800","2481840"," Put that on your calendar. "
"2482240","2484600"," Just be like, I'm going to pencil and what cap just said."
"2486040","2487660"," I'm going to explain it to you another way too."
"2488200","2492820"," You don't understand what I mean by the previous high and the new high. "
"2493040","2493660"," That's expected."
"2493900","2494980"," I'm going to show that to you right now."
"2496940","2499460"," So just back here in SPY specifically. "
"2501760","2503400"," I'll show it on SBX maybe."
"2503960","2504520"," I don't know if I can."
"2504880","2506300"," So hold on here. "
"2506300","2509380"," I finally have been coming back down high end watch prices."
"2509720","2511160"," And when I saw that story this morning."
"2511160","2512200"," So I want you to see. "
"2512480","2517200"," I want you to see that."
"2519500","2521140"," We've already hit up here."
"2523020","2525740"," So we've already tagged this boom. "
"2526040","2527180"," We've already tagged that right there."
"2527180","2527420"," Okay."
"2528160","2530980"," And expect by that September roll. "
"2531220","2534640"," October roll that we fail right in here."
"2534820","2534980"," Okay."
"2535880","2540140"," We're going to fail this one in September, October. "
"2540140","2542540"," Roll it down for a major correction."
"2543100","2546740"," Then we'll come back for December, January 1st."
"2547540","2548920"," You'll get the whale breach above. "
"2549520","2556800"," And then you'll get the major roll for February, January, February somewhere up in here."
"2557240","2559240"," That thesis is very much alive."
"2559500","2560800"," You may not believe it, but it is. "
"2561440","2564140"," We could trade 425 today."
"2564960","2567020"," And that thesis is still alive right there."
"2567020","2573520"," But just pay attention to it because there's a lot of money to be made on this failure right here. "
"2573560","2575500"," A ton of money to be made up here."
"2575640","2576620"," A ton of money for that."
"2576760","2578240"," That role should be more amplified. "
"2579160","2580860"," Expansion of volatility, right?"
"2581100","2581480"," It's volatility."
"2582000","2583240"," Just come in to the market."
"2584020","2590600"," The next one, there'll be an even larger cone shaped, megaphone shaped, whatever you want to call"
"2590600","2590780"," it. "
"2592180","2593240"," Expansion of volatility here."
"2593240","2596420"," And then an even larger expansion of volatility here."
"2597300","2599860"," And this would be your trough retest. "
"2600300","2604960"," Or as the bears would say, failure and, you know, depths of hell, right?"
"2605400","2606980"," You guys understand this concept?"
"2607500","2608380"," Hopefully you do."
"2609660","2614440"," If you don't get inside of the discord, some people in there can explain it to you."
"2614440","2616420"," This concept. "
"2617140","2617960"," So, there we go."
"2618120","2619380"," So just right now for bears."
"2619980","2621720"," You had your first pullback. "
"2621880","2624200"," You had your first correction in my view."
"2624640","2626960"," Now, this all needs to be confirmed."
"2629140","2632580"," So we are looking for some kind of confirmation down here. "
"2632720","2633920"," Wherever this hourly trigger is."
"2634140","2635980"," Whether it's today, tomorrow, next week."
"2637060","2639200"," This needs to be confirmed at some point. "
"2640340","2642380"," I had a confirmation on the opening bell down here."
"2643200","2645580"," Fifteen minute and the hourly is showing that reversal."
"2645580","2648060"," So you'll get another chance to get out if you need to. "
"2648900","2652740"," But we are starting to show a trend reversal."
"2653360","2656280"," One to three day and possibly one to three weeks."
"2657140","2658420"," So be aware of it. "
"2664890","2666390"," You guys understand that concept?"
"2666770","2668050"," So we get this."
"2668350","2672230"," We get like a little bit of like a fall like this, right?"
"2672690","2673930"," On this first pullback."
"2674830","2677810"," You get a larger pullback in the fall. "
"2678490","2681910"," And then in the late winter you get a major pullback, right?"
"2682170","2683490"," Just this expansion of volatility."
"2683490","2687030"," A good and bad."
"2687530","2691910"," And then it culminates in some kind of a major move. "
"2694250","2695590"," Now, things change."
"2696690","2696770"," Yes."
"2697670","2699770"," You know, there's things in the market we don't know. "
"2699990","2701150"," There are unknown."
"2702090","2702790"," It's a prediction."
"2703250","2705190"," It's not a, hey, we're going to do this. "
"2706040","2708750"," It's that everything right now says we are going to do that."
"2709410","2710850"," Unless something changes."
"2711450","2715510"," So we start breaking 425 and we're not coming back up. "
"2715530","2718330"," And there's some like unknown news."
"2719270","2726510"," I'm going to expect to that rollover in January, February, February will be associated with"
"2726510","2731930"," structural defects in China."
"2732110","2733970"," We've discussed that here before too. "
"2735250","2741130"," Drunken Miller made a great comment earlier in the year saying China's going to be fine until the"
"2741130","2742170"," beginning of the year."
"2743650","2745450"," That wasn't just Drunken Miller either."
"2745670","2749070"," There were some other people I showed you, other people that were talking about this in the spring. "
"2749670","2751710"," Anybody that's in here every day knows this stuff."
"2752370","2755310"," If you're a new follower, you may not know this stuff."
"2755490","2756870"," But people that are here every day know this stuff. "
"2758070","2764430"," We should see like, we're going to deal with China's structural problems with their economy."
"2766070","2771290"," And that would be the blame assigned or associated with that coming into Lunar New Year, right?"
"2774050","2779390"," So I would expect that kind of a thing and then some kind of a resolution."
"2780370","2781810"," We saved the day. "
"2782010","2782830"," We improved relations."
"2786170","2788430"," We're back, trade back on again with China."
"2788890","2790050"," Some kind of nonsense like that. "
"2793690","2799970"," There's another thought process here too of cutting rates."
"2800490","2803990"," I want to talk about this too with you briefly now that right now at this moment."
"2806150","2808010"," Likely the Fed cuts rates. "
"2811490","2816430"," Likely the Fed cuts rates in, let's call it summertime."
"2817210","2820650"," Late spring, early summer of 2024."
"2822070","2825510"," You're also going to get inflation bottoming. "
"2827370","2833190"," And you're also going to get likely some employment stuff happening."
"2833930","2836270"," And some kind of a front running."
"2836270","2839930"," Now, if the employment stuff doesn't happen, there's a key point here. "
"2841990","2848630"," If there's still jobs, jobs available and jobs stability and unemployment rate is still good, but"
"2848630","2849790"," we are going to cut rates."
"2850990","2854750"," That will determine how deep that rollover is."
"2855290","2857810"," So, I don't know if you understand these concepts, but. "
"2860510","2862230"," So, and they'll front run it."
"2862230","2868830"," So, if there's an expectation right now that they're going to cut by summer of 2024, if there is"
"2868830","2869450"," that expectation."
"2871010","2873350"," If you've seen inflation come down. "
"2875090","2879210"," And if you are, if you, but you don't see like jobs and employment get destroyed."
"2880470","2886990"," That will, that will matter to how deep that, that, that front running of pricing in rate cuts."
"2888190","2890570"," How deep that move will be in February. "
"2892510","2894290"," And we'll go over that as we get there."
"2894450","2897950"," So, as we get closer to that February or December 31st."
"2899130","2905230"," We'll get better price targets for that role. "
"2907430","2911770"," And these price targets held up in 2022 as well."
"2912530","2917010"," So, I want you to know that when we get into that time frame, we'll have exact numbers for you."
"2917010","2922310"," Like, this is your first target, this is your second target, and this is the worst target. "
"2925180","2929960"," For how bad that, that, that won't be a correction, that it's going to be a test."
"2930340","2932300"," I want you to know that that's not going to be corrective."
"2933120","2938320"," So, that February, January move should be violence, should be destructive. "
"2939640","2941720"," And it's going to, we're going to check that trough."
"2944000","2944440"," 100%."
"2944440","2945960"," And we might bounce off it. "
"2946760","2953460"," We might break down and test like 3650 or 3450."
"2954260","2958680"," Depending upon what's going on macro picture, depending upon what's going on with China."
"2959680","2960960"," That will matter. "
"2962020","2967700"," Maybe that cleans up the inverted yield curve to get down there to 3450 3600."
"2968840","2973080"," You get that final bounce really going to bounce off the top of the top of the top of the"
"2973080","2973340"," trough."
"2973340","2976320"," We're going to go down and retest that low. "
"2977760","2985860"," But regardless, either way, right, either way, as an investor, as a trader, you should have bought"
"2985860","2987160"," that fucking low, right?"
"2988300","2989260"," That's the point."
"2990420","2996080"," And when we get back down there again the next time, you should buy that low as well."
"2996080","3004200"," And in five or 10 years, you're going to still be here with me or check back in with me. "
"3004420","3007660"," We'll look back on those last five or 10 years."
"3008440","3014100"," And we'll see that those are places that you should have went long, right?"
"3016340","3019360"," You'll see that this move market will continue higher."
"3020320","3024220"," You will see that you had tradable bottoms all along the way. "
"3025800","3030680"," And we also know that if we have a fraud moment, the truth is if we ever do have a"
"3030680","3033500"," fraud moment, they're fairly easy to see."
"3034060","3041180"," Like you break below those lows and you start to reject and start trading lower, we know where they"
"3041180","3041420"," are."
"3042020","3043540"," We actually know where they are. "
"3044380","3047500"," I went over this once and I don't know if I went over it."
"3048280","3053160"," In that previous Sunday stream, but I went over it once with a small group with like Joe Donut and"
"3053160","3053520"," some people."
"3054260","3061880"," And I even showed them like, yeah, when we broke below the actual lows of every fraud in the U "
"3061880","3071140",".S. There was only two times in history think to going to instances going back to 1894 where we"
"3071140","3075280"," broke below the actual bottom of the market. "
"3075280","3077300"," This includes 2008."
"3078240","3082220"," We actually did tag the bottom of the market in that final role."
"3083160","3089000"," But in no other instance, except for two times in history, have we traded lower than that low, and"
"3089000","3092820"," that was the Great Depression and World War II. "
"3093100","3102350"," So unless we have some event like that, like World War III or another Great Depression, and I mean"
"3102350","3108770"," a real Great Depression where you're all like, you're all like walking up highways across the"
"3108770","3110930"," country, looking burning tires."
"3112350","3114170"," You got like a hobo stick and stuff."
"3114410","3118010"," Unless you have something like that, we kind of know where the bottoms are. "
"3118390","3118890"," Not even kind of."
"3118950","3120050"," We know them to pretty much tick."
"3121710","3123490"," So stay tuned over the years. "
"3123750","3124570"," Stay tuned over the next year."
"3125050","3126210"," Stay tuned into springtime."
"3126950","3128350"," Stay tuned into. "
"3130670","3135590"," Into the next five or 10 years because it's a great process to watch as it unfolds."
"3135590","3140950"," I was thinking about Joe this morning because we go over this stuff every three months, six months"
"3140950","3141430"," a year."
"3142390","3143450"," And it's all held up. "
"3143670","3144930"," None of it's not held up."
"3145130","3147930"," There's like, we know where the even the depths are like."
"3148510","3150170"," You expect the difficulty about here. "
"3150410","3153070"," This is like you have 15% chance of this happening."
"3153290","3155750"," You have a 5% chance of this happening."
"3156810","3160130"," Now those chances are going lower, even lower now. "
"3160290","3160330"," Right?"
"3160510","3160970"," That kind of stuff."
"3161290","3163850"," So stick with me here for the next till springtime."
"3164170","3165530"," Stick with me the next five years. "
"3166790","3169090"," I've been with these guys for a few years now."
"3170130","3172070"," It's all all these predictions are working."
"3172070","3174170"," So they haven't filled once. "
"3174350","3176110"," As a matter of fact, these predictions will give you now."
"3176590","3177930"," They're fucking valid, man."
"3178030","3179750"," They're valid into springtime. "
"3180910","3182930"," And you're going to see that bottom get bought."
"3182930","3185370"," We're going to trade 5,000 off that bottom."
"3186310","3189410"," Then we're going to start trading 10 and 15,000. "
"3189730","3191390"," Now that sounds insane to you."
"3191810","3194710"," But that'll be the next five years, the next 10 years."
"3195050","3197470"," So going down. "
"3197650","3203510"," Now, trading debt now down to test the one minute."
"3204170","3206070"," One 29 EMA right here."
"3207370","3210870"," Remember that we always talk about testing down below here. "
"3210870","3212750"," So we're going to look on the five and 15 minute."
"3214660","3216080"," Got that test right here."
"3216360","3218260"," This test down is a five minute chart. "
"3218680","3224200"," You know that upward trend is bullish when we're above the five minute, 20, 70 EMA."
"3224340","3228740"," This is bullish if we stay above this on a 15 minute basis right here."
"3230700","3232820"," You are looking for the test right here. "

"3245810","3247830"," Yeah, I think that's about it somewhere down in here."
"3248410","3253880"," One that I'm looking at is 4843."
"3255120","3256820"," So I'm looking for a debt buy right here. "
"3259020","3259780"," Or 4843."
"3260300","3261760"," This is what I want to buy is that right there."
"3264080","3264840"," Or 4843. "

"3291090","3291850"," One minute."
"3295980","3298100"," So I would like to buy this right here. "

"3354750","3355630"," Five minute chart."
"3355890","3356430"," This is trend. "
"3357330","3359890"," I'm going to leave it in the one minute here so you can see it."
"3360370","3363670"," So you don't get to."
"3364150","3365510"," This is trend right here. "
"3366910","3368150"," You don't want to see this break."
"3371070","3372290"," So you can see it there."
"3373610","3375130"," This is where people get panicky, right?"
"3375130","3375890"," And one minute charts. "
"3379010","3381950"," This is where people get stopped out when you should begin to stop that above."
"3386820","3388760"," This is where Cap wants to buy right there."
"3398910","3399390"," Ooh. "
"3400190","3400670"," Ooh."

"3422320","3423280"," We're going to return it."
"3423380","3427040"," They're going to attempt to return to the lower scene of the crime. "
"3435120","3436220"," Jesus, I said I was going to go."
"3436500","3438280"," I'm supposed to be at a meeting right now."
"3438880","3441320"," So I'm like, Oh, I want to buy some fucking one dates again. "
"3443240","3446020"," I bet you, I bet you these guys are pissed at me right now."
"3446120","3447400"," I hope they're not in the on stream."
"3448380","3451340"," So I'm looking at, I'm looking at Friday calls again. "

"3753700","3754240"," I don't know."
"3754340","3755420"," The red line comes down."
"3755620","3756700"," The white line comes down. "

"4041300","4043340"," You don't want to see Vello go below zero."
"4043620","4045220"," Or else we start selling rips majorly."
"4045400","4046660"," That's a correction territory. "
"4047660","4051600"," We're not in negative Vello on daily right now."
"4051600","4056820"," You're going to expect now for all these dips to be supportive if Vello becomes positive, right?"
"4057320","4059340"," You get like zero to five, zero to ten."
"4059920","4064220"," You're going to switch to a positive environment for the spy for dips to be bought and selling the"
"4064220","4064800"," rip to be done. "
"4065460","4066920"," So let me explain this in a better way."
"4068720","4071460"," So on daily Vello on spy specifically."
"4072780","4073820"," ES SPX. "
"4074460","4076360"," If this was 100, right?"
"4076820","4077500"," Positive 100."
"4082510","4084170"," This was 50."
"4085110","4086330"," This was zero. "
"4092080","4093200"," This is 25."
"4093860","4094380"," This is 50."
"4094620","4096279"," And this is 100 negative, okay?"
"4096500","4097859"," So you have negative, negative 100. "
"4105250","4107529"," This is, let's call this zero right here."
"4107630","4108689"," Let's just say this is zero."
"4109529","4110590"," It's a zero line. "
"4112290","4115410"," So as we're coming up, we're support market is supportive."
"4115850","4116510"," Market is supportive."
"4116870","4117350"," Market is supportive. "
"4119270","4119529"," Pull back."
"4119750","4120109"," Pull back."
"4120229","4120649"," Pull back. "
"4120750","4121149"," Pull back."
"4121270","4122170"," Pull back."
"4122170","4122410"," Pull back, right?"
"4124210","4125450"," It starts to come up again. "
"4125529","4126390"," It's supportive, right?"
"4127250","4128410"," You can expect dips to be bought."
"4129810","4132490"," If it breaks below, we're in corrective territory."
"4132930","4137310"," Solid rip, solid rip, solid rip, solid rip, solid rip, solid rip, solid rip, solid rip, solid rip. "
"4137310","4140130"," By the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the"
"4140130","4140590"," dip, by the dip, right?"
"4141550","4142750"," Violent desert heads higher."
"4143910","4146090"," Then market becomes supportive, right?"
"4147069","4147510"," Same kind of a thing."
"4147729","4149310"," So right now we're like right here. "
"4151390","4157609"," And we're showing signs of another bull run right now, showing signs of it."
"4157790","4165990"," So I want you to be aware of that unless we start breaking below and holding and velocity on daily"
"4165990","4167350"," trigger starts to go down."
"4168830","4173490"," And right now, velocity is showing up and the trigger is showing up too. "
"4173689","4175830"," So be careful if you're a bear, please."
"4178010","4180890"," For that, for that next corrective move down in the marketplace."
"4183430","4185649"," I'll see all you guys later this afternoon. "
"4185810","4189069"," I'm going to put some news on in the background and the financial juice for you."
"4189350","4191029"," I'm going to leave all of this up for you here."
"4191350","4192910"," I'll be in the office all day long. "
"4193069","4196970"," I have some technical things and so I have to do."
"4197050","4199510"," I can't not do it outside of office business hours."
"4200410","4201230"," I apologize for that. "
"4201310","4205810"," I want to be here with you guys and I can't."
"4205810","4207090"," I did buy this down here."
"4207530","4208110"," Just so you know. "
"4209070","4210890"," So I did get my buy in with you."
"4211790","4213810"," If you've missed the chance to enter long."
"4214530","4217030"," This is just second chance to enter long. "
"4218210","4223650"," You saw me enter long yesterday in the depths of hell with some major money in the market."
"4223890","4224890"," I don't know what else to say to you."
"4224970","4228010"," I'm sure somebody going to come back in a week or two and be like, can I get in now"
"4228010","4229910"," to cap or something crazy like that. "
"4231050","4235790"," So there you are."
"4236910","4242730"," I'll reconsider for a corrective move to the downside like something more major."
"4244350","4247090"," It's like Apple traded one seventy seven. "
"4247250","4251930"," If it trades one seventy four, I'm going to stay in these positions, especially the one that's for"
"4251930","4252330"," September."
"4252930","4257970"," But if we start breaking like one seventy four on Apple, like rejecting there and want to go lower"
"4257970","4260570"," and a major market move down."
"4261670","4268610"," I'll reconsider and possibly close one side of that trade and get extremely bearish. "
"4268810","4269950"," But right now nothing's showing that."
"4270090","4271890"," So nothing was showing at the top either."
"4272110","4274810"," So we'll see what's up. "
"4275950","4277210"," I wish you guys all luck today."
"4277610","4278010"," Feel bad."
"4278150","4282730"," I'm like, I feel like you guys are my family like I want to leave my family right now. "
"4285170","4286670"," So we'll leave this up right here."
"4286670","4289950"," Now, just so you know, there's a very small gap down below right here."
"4291490","4292910"," This is where the pivot point is. "
"4293050","4295270"," The tiny, tiniest of gaps down here."
"4297520","4301180"," Let me say I make bring this up so you can have a good look at it."
"4302060","4305620"," Daily trigger, hourly trigger, R2 pivot point. "
"4308580","4309980"," Very small gap to the downside."
"4312580","4314160"," PT up here, R3 up here."
"4314640","4316400"," STX cell, if you want to know where it is. "
"4318040","4320060"," STX cell is 45414."
"4322490","4325670"," I don't expect that though until the weekly maybe."
"4327450","4328770"," Tomorrow or something like that. "
"4337160","4337860"," Love all you guys."
"4338640","4340680"," Please like and subscribe share these videos."
"4341140","4341960"," Tell your friends out there. "
"4342840","4344220"," And you guys are getting websites in."
"4344420","4345460"," It's looking really fucking good."
"4345600","4346580"," Just as a website update. "
"4347300","4349360"," It's very complicated to do what we're doing."
"4350140","4351860"," It's not an easy thing to do."
"4352760","4358540"," It's not like I'm popping up gamma levels and writing a fucking post for you every night morning. "
"4359680","4363140"," You know, on a fucking Excel spreadsheet or something like that."
"4363400","4365300"," And then working up to like building tools."
"4365980","4367960"," We're trying to launch with something substantial. "
"4368960","4372820"," So just be patient with us."
"4373900","4377240"," So that we're, I don't, I'm trying to do this for retailers."
"4378420","4379880"," I'm not here to make money. "
"4380460","4385980"," I want to like I said, I have like, I have like my motivations and my drives are to give"
"4385980","4390780"," a website for retailers to have an edge."
"4391520","4396600"," It's not an easy thing to do to give a website that gives you an edge in the market."
"4397260","4407240"," Oftentimes you'll pay for a service and it gives you every, it tells you like, like the upside,"
"4407320","4408900"," the middle and then the downside. "
"4408900","4411240"," And there's no conviction in that."
"4415040","4418720"," So oftentimes those people try to sound like they're smart and look flashy."
"4419860","4424460"," They have to make up for that by giving you all those outs so they don't look bad. "
"4424720","4427360"," No one wants to be called out for like making a wrong call."
"4428060","4429480"," It's all about image, right?"
"4430340","4431560"," You have to maintain an image."
"4431740","4432580"," You have to maintain an image. "
"4433280","4437440"," Like I have to like rent a mansion and pretend that I'm living in a mansion."
"4438180","4441620"," I have to rent a G4 and pretend I own a G4."
"4443000","4451900"," I can't make a call or a conviction as to where we're going because I don't want to ever be"
"4451900","4453000"," wrong, that kind of stuff. "
"4454000","4457460"," So there's like that model and I don't like that model."
"4457740","4460640"," I'm always looking for an edge and it's hard to get an edge."
"4460640","4465840"," So the two ways that I see it getting an edge is, or three, there's more ways, but like time"
"4465840","4467440"," and market, trading with somebody else. "
"4469700","4473500"," Some kind of tools that tell you, hey, expect a bounce here."
"4473860","4475300"," Hey, expect to sell here."
"4475840","4476800"," Hey, expect this to happen. "
"4477180","4478120"," Is it always going to happen like that?"
"4478400","4479420"," No, but enough."
"4479720","4483440"," If it happens enough 70, 80, 90% of the time, it is an edge."
"4483800","4486640"," And that's the intent. "
"4486640","4492480"," And the other part of the intent is to make it sustainable for a retailer."
"4493160","4495000"," So that a retailer has a fucking edge."
"4495000","4497480"," Now that work has to continue in the future too. "
"4498360","4502220"," If that edge is lost, right, there's always has to be development and that kind of stuff."
"4502960","4503900"," It has to be sustainable."
"4504320","4505960"," So if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. "
"4506180","4512160"," If it doesn't become sustainable, we're going to shut it all down because I can't do just this"
"4512160","4512480"," forever."
"4513900","4518800"," As, as for what it is, it's costing me a lot of money and time of family, all that kind"
"4518800","4519440"," of stuff too."
"4519820","4524960"," And so I want to do, want to be able to like leave this for retailers. "
"4526080","4532540"," Cause I feel like I always paid for this stuff and I never, I never got what I was looking"
"4532540","4532900"," for."
"4533160","4535640"," I always feel like there's something lacking and I'm hoping we can do that."
"4535800","4541360"," So I'll work on it over the next two, three years here and see if it works. "
"4541860","4550420"," See if it's something that is an edge and we're going to ask you guys too along the way to"
"4550420","4551320"," help us with this edge."
"4552280","4555080"," We're going to, this is something where we're going to work with the community too."
"4555180","4559840"," So if people in the community inside of Discord, people that talk to you guys on the phone text"
"4559840","4561060"," message, all that kind of stuff. "
"4562680","4569080"," A lot of you know, there's a group of probably 20 of us right now and this isn't like one"
"4569080","4569360"," guy."
"4569360","4570720"," This isn't like just Kevin Jim James."
"4570780","4576880"," It's just like a solid group of serious people working on this in the background professionals"
"4576880","4579040"," working on this in the background. "
"4580060","4584280"," This isn't like some fucking day-to-day trader working on this."
"4584500","4591620"," These are like, I've got a machine learning artificial intelligence staff engineer from one of the"
"4591620","4593840"," biggest tech companies in the fucking world."
"4594640","4595680"," Like no joking. "
"4596080","4602640"," So like, you know, I got traders that are professionals that are giving me guidance in the"
"4602640","4602880"," background."
"4603260","4607320"," There are like some serious motherfuckers, as far as you're saying that, in the background trying"
"4607320","4608180"," to help us along here."
"4608300","4612320"," So hopefully you can make this work for you as a trader. "
"4613640","4615200"," Here goes your test on the hourly trigger."
"4615900","4619640"," So that's where an update, for an update where we are and we're doing a bunch of stuff in the"
"4619640","4620080"," background trigger."
"4620500","4623940"," I will be back with you at some point later this afternoon. "
"4624260","4626300"," I'll check back in with you today and I'll check back in with you."
"4626480","4627040"," I'll be here again."
"4627120","4630440"," This is the same kind of fashion tomorrow as well. "
"4631840","4634120"," So you can see if this works for you."
"4634600","4635740"," You'll all get to test it."
"4635920","4638440"," There'll be a free option for everybody to test it out. "
"4639380","4642560"," There'll always be a free way to work your way around it."
"4642560","4648020"," There'll always be cheaper entries too."
"4648140","4650060"," If you don't want to pay for all these different structures. "
"4650460","4657340"," Yeah, I just want part of the discord or I just want this or I just want that or I'm"
"4657340","4658640"," working my way around here."
"4659000","4664080"," There's a minimum entry to try to support what we're doing in one way"
"4664080","4672280"," or another."
"4673340","4675420"," But this stuff does cost money to put out. "
"4675740","4677100"," This is expensive stuff."
"4677360","4678660"," It's costing a lot of money."
"4678700","4688360"," It costs money with attorneys and engineers and professionals in the stock"
"4688360","4692560"," market, like actual stock market professionals, the data, the development. "
"4693060","4693980"," This stuff is not cheap."
"4694840","4696600"," So we'll see if this works."
"4696600","4700960"," If it does, if it doesn't, dudes, I'm telling you right now, you guys all know me. "
"4701020","4703640"," You guys have known me since I'm a fucking nobody."
"4704040","4707440"," So if it doesn't work, we'll just stop it."
"4707480","4708820"," We'll just go back to a small trading group. "
"4709720","4712500"," You know, twenty hundred people get together once a week or something like that."
"4713000","4714040"," We'll hang out in a private discord."
"4715140","4717700"," We'll fuck around, you know, that kind of stuff. "
"4718060","4719920"," So either way, it's all positive."
"4720160","4721000"," So I want you to all know that."
"4722880","4724700"," And I'll see you guys on the flip side. "
"4724780","4725600"," I'll see you guys later today."
"4725600","4731910"," Yeah, I'll see you guys in a bit."
"4732670","4735210"," And you guys are all going to, there's going to be beta testers. "
"4735910","4737110"," There's going to be a free trial."
"4737610","4738850"," It's going to be like, it's really cool."
"4739110","4740230"," Like, does this work for me?"
"4741770","4742610"," That kind of stuff. "
"4742870","4743770"," Does this give me help?"
"4743970","4744550"," Does it give me an edge?"
"4744610","4745290"," All that kind of cool stuff."
"4745490","4745830"," It's really cool."
"4747110","4748430"," We actually have some guys too. "
"4748690","4749490"," We got some other stuff too."
"4749590","4755570"," We got like, we have guys working on like a training program, which is kind of cool."
"4756730","4759470"," For people where you have like four trainers. "
"4760530","4761890"," I think it's three to four trainers."
"4763750","4766330"," So you'd spend like one on one time with people."
"4766830","4770550"," An educational series, find out what you guys are looking for, that kind of stuff. "
"4770750","4772050"," And then actual one on one."
"4772770","4773470"," We have other examples."
"4773770","4778250"," We have people that right now that are in like a modified program right now. "
"4778330","4781750"," They have proven wins, proven consistent winning."
"4781750","4784090"," So that stuff's all super fucking cool too."
"4784310","4785910"," We have actual people inside. "
"4787150","4792750"," Right now beta tested being trained how to trade with verifiable."
"4795070","4799890"," Green accounts like green every month, green month, green month, green month, green month, green"
"4799890","4800150"," month."
"4800410","4802670"," So this stuff's pretty fucking cool. "
"4803050","4803910"," What's going on?"
"4804130","4804250"," So."
"4806590","4808310"," Yeah, look forward."
"4808690","4811670"," I look forward to launching this with you guys here. "
"4811670","4812110"," Really shortly."
"4813970","4815070"," I'll talk to you guys soon."
"4821830","4823090"," Yeah, I'll talk to you guys very soon. "
"4831180","4832880"," Let me put the stuff on for you."
"4833060","4835720"," I'm thinking about this right now because it's kind of blowing my mind."
"4836520","4837940"," Kind of blowing my fucking mind. "
"4838180","4838740"," Having like a moment."
"4841340","4844160"," Like if I could spend, it's like there's an example, right?"
"4844240","4847760"," I used to spend like six or seven hundred dollars in one place."
"4848940","4849840"," Wasn't one on one. "
"4850500","4852660"," Wasn't like dedicated trainers training me."
"4852940","4853340"," Wasn't."
"4854380","4857400"," Every day with like a group of people and I'm like, can't leave a pail. "
"4857400","4858200"," I'm money for all this."
"4861280","4864260"," I'm like really like thinking about this deeply."
"4864620","4869800"," We also have, dude, we got like somebody that's going to come on board and do nightly recap videos"
"4869800","4870300"," for you. "
"4870800","4875120"," We got some cool ass shit coming like cool as fuck."
"4875460","4878000"," Like bad ass shit."
"4879180","4879980"," Bad ass shit. "
"4880880","4882540"," We got gamma coming for you, dude."
"4882540","4884260"," Like you guys want gamma, like there's going to be gamma."
"4884540","4885960"," It's like it's all kinds of stupid shit. "
"4886180","4888760"," So it's really cool."
"4889140","4889440"," All right."
"4889580","4890200"," I'll talk to you guys soon. "
"4897660","4900500"," Staley says I am supportive of the rate hike we took in July."
"4901100","4903040"," So daily is out there talking right now."
"4903860","4905180"," So he's blabbing away. "
"4907980","4908600"," Blabbing away."
"4910850","4912110"," Blabity, blabity, blab."
"4919350","4919950"," That's daily. "
"4920150","4921870"," I'm going to leave this on for you down here."
"4921970","4924730"," We would want to see a path of inflation completely downward."
"4924730","4932860"," Well, first of all, we can talk about 2% core inflation. "
"4933960","4938480"," Staley says the key is good price inflation which is coming down and shows the price inflation"
"4938480","4940680"," which we protect is coming down."
"4940960","4946400"," And in order to know where it came from, you have to read what former Fed Vice Chairman Roger"
"4946400","4948720"," Ferguson wrote not too long ago."
"4949000","4956080"," He points out that 2% was a random number that originated in New Zealand in the 1980s. "
"4956080","4957680"," It didn't come from an academic study."
"4958080","4961600"," It was just an offhand comment during a television interview."
"4961900","4965280"," And everybody else said, yeah, that sounds like a decent number. "
"4965280","4966880"," Let's adopt that."
"4967100","4969940"," The fact that, well, not just the Fed, right?"
"4970160","4972720"," I mean, that's all rented by central banks around the world."
"4972720","4976980"," And quite frankly, without sounding too flippant, it doesn't matter where it came from. "
"4977260","4982600"," The fact is Jerome Powell has stated time and time again that he's going to keep pushing until the"
"4982600","4984080"," Fed gets to 2%."
"4984080","4987300"," Or at least as near as damn it to 2%."
"4987300","4993440"," That's the risk factor that, hey, we're going to aim for this random number, even though the entire"
"4993440","4998180"," inflation regime and the entire economic regime has changed. "
"4998660","5006260"," The 2010s were an era of monetary stimulus of a very anemic post financial crisis recovery."
"5007120","5013760"," And we were looking up towards 2% when job creation was kind of soft and consumer spending was weak"
"5013760","5014800"," and GDP was soft."
"5015340","5021760"," Now, fast forward to the 2020s, we've had a regime change and it's gone from monetary to 6 trillion"
"5021760","5025120"," plus in fiscal stimulus just in the United States. "
"5025260","5028100"," I'm not talking about other countries, fiscal stimulus."
"5028760","5034800"," And so you go from an anemic economy to a robust post lockdown recovery."
"5035580","5037340"," And 2% is really a silly number. "
"5037340","5044060"," I want to convince the Fed that, hey, maybe you should be looking at a 3, looking down at a"
"5044060","5045280"," 3% target."
"5045900","5050180"," Lawrence Ball is a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research 2013."
"5050280","5052380"," He suggested 4%. "
"5052380","5054800"," So this isn't completely out there."
"5055300","5060660"," People have discussed that the inflation target is just kind of a silly random number."
"5061000","5063260"," Why is the Fed share so obsessed with it?"
"5063260","5067040"," It's clear in their communications that they certainly are. "
"5067260","5071000"," Hey, Barry, we pretty much finished up on this earnings cycle here."
"5072380","5074580"," Are we in the midst of an earnings recession?"
"5075780","5080180"," Yeah, that's one of those things that we keep hearing people talk about."
"5080640","5083560"," Oh, my goodness, look at this horrific earnings recession. "
"5084500","5090040"," And the problem with any given quarter is the tendency to forget the bigger context."
"5090380","5092200"," Forget what came before."
"5092200","5097660"," I'm not a big fan of going X, like I think you have to look at the whole picture, but"
"5097660","5102400"," you can't completely ignore, hey, how did the earnings look without financials?"
"5102800","5104200"," How did the earnings look without energy?"
"5104980","5114480"," And essentially more than 100 plus percent of the 8% downturn in this quarter's earnings is pure"
"5114480","5114960"," energy. "
"5115320","5117260"," It's just the downfall in energy."
"5117260","5123760"," Now, remember last year, when everything was sticking up the joint in 2022, energy was the only"
"5123760","5124580"," bright spot."
"5124920","5132740"," When industrials and consumer discretionary and even technology was looking at an energy shortfall,"
"5133360","5136180"," I'm sorry, a profit shortfall, energy did great. "
"5136540","5142060"," Whether it was the war in Ukraine or other factors, I'll let the economists debate, but clearly"
"5142060","5149380"," coming off of that really hot year now, year of year, when we look at energy profits, they're down"
"5149380","5150940"," more than 51%."
"5151600","5155200"," So back that out, which is really abirational."
"5155220","5161360"," You have this giant surge last year and this giant collapse this year plus 1.4% is pretty decent. "
"5161560","5167980"," And when we look at quarter over quarter, earnings are up X energy plus 8.3%. That's pretty"
"5167980","5168600"," substantial."
"5169500","5176320"," Just look at the S&P 500 year over year with energy and we're up 0.6%. So not the"
"5176320","5184060"," worst sort of thing in terms of revenues, that's 0.6%. So I don't understand why there's all this"
"5184060","5187840"," hand-wringing about a earnings recession."
"5188340","5189820"," It looks pretty good from where I sit. "
"5190140","5198780"," Well, in order for the Fed to keep inflation down with monetary policy, I would have to think you"
"5198780","5202360"," need an earnings recession or you need to keep earnings growth in check."
"5202360","5209740"," Otherwise, how does raising interest rates only reduce inflation without affecting the rest of the"
"5209740","5210420"," economic picture?"
"5211380","5217240"," So let's go to your fundamental principle there in order for the Fed to keep rates now with"
"5217240","5218140"," monetary policy."
"5218620","5224340"," Let me remind everybody, we spent more than a decade with rates about zero and we had no inflation. "
"5224340","5231760"," If zero rates didn't cause inflation, maybe higher rates isn't how you cure inflation, especially"
"5231760","5238560"," this particular flavor of inflation, which has been caused not just by fiscal policy, but hey, we"
"5238560","5244340"," had a crazy supply chain snarl that finally has been mostly resolved."
"5244860","5246660"," We have a shortage of single-family homes."
"5246700","5249840"," We still have problems getting enough semiconductors for cars. "
"5249840","5253780"," And there is undeniably a shortage of labor."
"5254540","5258740"," I don't see how the Fed raising rates further from here is going to build more houses."
"5258980","5264580"," We'll get more people into jobs, get more potential employees to be hired. "
"5265460","5267880"," Those are the drivers of the inflation we're seeing."
"5268180","5269920"," But Harry isn't going to affect that."
"5270100","5276560"," Isn't dumping bucket loads of dollars out of helicopters partly responsible?"
"5276560","5279460"," I mean, how much fiscal spending was there?"
"5279540","5283980"," Obviously, there wasn't inflation for the decade of zero rates because we weren't spending five"
"5283980","5287500"," trillion dollars out to the American people in cash. "
"5288260","5294120"," Right, so you had two trillion in CARES Act one, almost another trillion in CARES Act two, a fourth"
"5294120","5296780"," near trillion in CARES Act three."
"5297260","5299780"," So that's what's already coursed its way through the system."
"5300360","5304060"," That pig is mostly, not fully, but mostly through the Python. "
"5304060","5308780"," Looking forward the inflation reduction act, the semiconductors act, the infrastructure bill."
"5309420","5313680"," That's also stimulating, but that's spread out over 10 years."
"5313900","5315340"," So it's going to be much more modest. "
"5315840","5322040"," And again, another reason to think of 2% as the room inflation target, given all of this fiscal"
"5322040","5325680"," stimulus that's in the pipeline, maybe 3% makes more sense."
"5326880","5327940"," What are you driving, Barry?"
"5328940","5329720"," Today, this weekend."
"5330300","5332560"," Well, it looks like it's going to rain here. "
"5332760","5335160"," So the Cabrio is going to stay in the garage."
"5336020","5336840"," I don't know."
"5336960","5341980"," It really depends on where we decide we're going to have an office meeting. "
"5342440","5348620"," And depending who shows up and what they've seen, I may, and the possibility of rain, I just may"
"5348620","5351660"," take the all-wheel drive outy and show up."
"5351940","5356660"," Even though that's really a race car, but you can drive it like a normal car."
"5356840","5358920"," Well, that's the RA that you're talking about. "
"5358920","5362060"," Yeah, the V8, 6-speed, gated shifter."
"5363260","5369960"," It's a fun car, and PS, one of the things we always tell investors is you have to keep your"
"5369960","5374220"," wits about you when the market is selling off and people are panicking."
"5374880","5381760"," I picked up that car for a song in March 2020, or maybe it was April 2020, because everybody was"
"5381760","5382540"," freaking out. "
"5383300","5388940"," The thing that investors seem to overlook constantly is, you know, you got to sell them when"
"5388940","5389760"," everyone hates them."
"5390540","5390980"," Yup."
"5391180","5395460"," Sell them when everyone loves them and buy them when everyone hates them, and not stop once I'm"
"5395460","5395700"," older. "
"5396040","5396160"," Right."
"5396160","5397920"," But cars and other collectibles."
"5398400","5399480"," Yeah, there's a very..."
"5399480","5401860"," We're going to have to leave it there and enjoy your driving. "

"5423760","5424100"," projected."
"5424540","5429440"," Some of that was due to the writer's strike, but Disney has also been on an aggressive cost-cutting"
"5429440","5429800"," push."
"5430300","5431420"," That's included job cuts. "

"5811830","5813150"," Matt thinks inflation is still too high."
"5813390","5814390"," I'm a friend of the trend. "
"5814390","5815790"," I like the trends coming down."
"5815790","5817350"," That's what I'm focusing on."
"5817550","5819530"," How did you view the CPI print today?"
"5819910","5821970"," And how does that impact kind of how you're thinking about these markets?"
"5822470","5823570"," So great to be with you. "
"5823710","5826010"," We were very positive on this print."
"5826610","5832610"," The Fed waged a war against the 40-year high inflation by raising interest rates to a 22-year high."
"5832930","5834710"," And it's clear that the Fed has won this war. "
"5835530","5842570"," Inflation has come down from around 9% down to around 3.2%. I think this is constructive for the"
"5842570","5843870"," equity markets in the long term."
"5844430","5848270"," Are you not concerned that there's a chance it comes back?"
"5850450","5856630"," Well, what we think is that from this point onwards, the inflation will most likely start to cool"
"5856630","5857550"," off on its own."
"5857790","5862730"," Because even if you look at the unemployment rate, we think that it is understated right now"
"5862730","5865130"," because a lot of the layoffs have been in the tech space. "
"5865870","5869550"," And a lot of those workers are high earners, so they're not necessarily claiming unemployment"
"5869550","5870230"," benefits."
"5870230","5876070"," And also, the Fed is going to be very careful about not damaging the unemployment rate too much in"
"5876070","5877750"," this politically charged environment."
"5878410","5881550"," So we think it's going to start to cool off on its own from this point onwards. "
"5882030","5888090"," I just saw total consumer credit rose $17.8 billion last month."
"5888970","5893590"," There was a small monthly increase before, so credit had kind of stagnated."
"5893590","5900270"," But now it's come roaring back, especially student loans and auto loans. "
"5900670","5906650"," And if people are able to weather 7% or 8% auto loans and are still willing to go"
"5906650","5913670"," pay these incredibly high prices for vehicles, I feel like they could push inflation higher."
"5914050","5915010"," They could bounce it back up."
"5915610","5922890"," Fair point, but I also feel that at some point, this excess savings that people have from the"
"5922890","5924990"," pandemic, they're going to run out of it. "
"5925430","5929330"," And when they run out of it, they'll start cutting back on some of the services, right?"
"5929450","5934670"," So they'll start going to blooming dales and they'll start going to Costco, right?"
"5934810","5936430"," So they'll become more budget conscious."
"5936710","5940690"," And I think that will also start to bring inflation down and the data is supporting that."
"5940950","5941290"," All right. "
"5941470","5947550"," So given that backdrop, I deal with benign inflation outlooks still decent economic growth, all the"
"5947550","5948870"," slower than what we've seen."
"5950010","5951010"," What do you do here?"
"5951010","5953610"," Are you equity's fixed income?"
"5954190","5954970"," Where do you start?"
"5955650","5961310"," Well, fixed income is also very attractive over here, but if we take a longer term point of view, I"
"5961310","5964110"," think equity is where you get the most bang for your buck."
"5964870","5968510"," We are of the school of thought that we think in the short term, you're going to get a correction"
"5968510","5972010"," in the market because seasonally, this is a weak period of the year. "
"5972490","5976890"," So on the equity side, we would be looking at opportunities on a pullback."
"5976890","5983650"," The two parts of the market that we like over here is the high quality momentum areas, and then the"
"5983650","5986930"," less loved stocks that haven't participated in the rally so far."
"5987310","5991430"," So we would be looking at opportunistically on those areas on a pullback. "
"5991550","5991710"," All right."
"5991870","5995810"," So does that mean, is that the medicine of the world, the Google's of the world, the Amazon's?"
"5995970","5998990"," You look, you buy them on a pullback or kind of what's that first group for you?"
"5999170","5999350"," Yes."
"5999390","6002450"," So that would be certainly that's one group of stocks. "
"6002710","6005030"," The stocks on our watch list, for example, Apple and Meta."
"6005030","6005570"," Okay."
"6005930","6007610"," You know, Apple just came out with the earnings. "
"6007890","6010990"," The street did not like it because the iPhone sales went down."
"6011410","6016350"," But we actually saw strength over there because we saw the service business row, which is, you"
"6016350","6020130"," know, the profit margins almost doubled out of the product business."
"6020370","6023710"," So those are the type of areas that we would be very interested in on a pullback. "
"6024150","6025130"," What do you think about?"
"6025470","6029910"," I mean, rates at this level, you kind of want to lock those in."
"6029910","6034610"," Don't you think that a lot of people are going to want to lock in 4% 10 years?"
"6035770","6036210"," Yes."
"6036390","6041470"," Actually, we have a lot of clients that have cash that are looking to lock in good rates. "
"6041790","6046450"," So certainly I think that's in the short term, that is going to be a headwind in the market."
"6046950","6052370"," But I think that in the long term, you get better risk adjusted returns on the equities."
"6053170","6053410"," All right. "
"6053730","6055550"," So, I mean, Matt's been overweight."
"6055870","6058410"," You know, those magnificent seven, me, not so much."
"6058410","6062170"," So if I'm looking for this market to kind of broaden out a little bit, because I think I need"
"6062170","6064350"," to see that for just the health of the market. "
"6064750","6068970"," If I don't own the magnificent seven, if I don't want to go chase those things, where do I go?"
"6069390","6071650"," Or should I take profits and get in?"
"6071770","6072270"," You let it ride."
"6072470","6073170"," Just let it ride."
"6074330","6076290"," Well, I agree with you completely. "
"6076630","6080650"," Like if you look at the S&P 500 up until the end of last month, it was up about"
"6080650","6083450"," 19.6%. You look at the equal weight index."
"6083530","6089130"," It was up about 9.6%. So I would be looking at some of the less love stocks, like for"
"6089130","6092410"," example, another stock on our watch list is Home Depot, right?"
"6092590","6096630"," So Home Depot did really well during the pandemic because we were trapped in our homes and we just"
"6096630","6098210"," wanted to improve our living experience."
"6098670","6104150"," Since then, the demand has subsided, but we still see a great long term potential because in the"
"6104150","6108390"," US, we have a housing shortage and people do have to upgrade their homes, which benefits a company"
"6108390","6109130"," like Home Depot. "
"6109470","6111010"," And you own Home Depot."
"6111230","6112250"," You also own Apple."
"6112250","6117810"," I feel like the market has soured a bit. "
"6117970","6123150"," Well, clearly they've come down below the $3 trillion value and we see iPhone sales stagnating."
"6123590","6125510"," Why do you own Apple longer term?"
"6126130","6131990"," So we think that the service business, there's a lot of strength over there, so we like that."
"6132310","6136810"," And then also we think that the iPhone 15 release could be a significant upgrade. "
"6137430","6139390"," The quality of our phones are improving."
"6139790","6143150"," So we are holding on to our phones longer before we upgrading it."
"6143490","6147070"," So I think this upcoming release of iPhone 15 could be a good catalyst. "
"6147750","6149170"," And the company pays a good dividend."
"6149470","6150530"," I just don't know what's going to change."
"6150950","6155030"," The phones that Paul and I have are already capable of everything we need to do. "
"6155230","6155990"," I got an iPhone 11."
"6156550","6157390"," Yeah, that's what I got."
"6157810","6158770"," I might upgrade though. "
"6159070","6160410"," I'm going to take a test on this Apple."
"6160930","6163370"," Every time I see Tim Cook, I say you got to raise your dividend."
"6163810","6166130"," You've got to dividend less than 1% man up. "
"6166310","6171310"," Go to 3%, 3.5%. Are you surprised that they don't do that with all the cash they have on"
"6171310","6171790"," the balance sheet?"
"6171970","6173490"," All the free cash flow they have."
"6173630","6175070"," Anything that they should raise their dividend?"
"6175830","6179570"," Well, I mean, they're entering into a different phase of the business."
"6179790","6182550"," And I think they are doing great with the share buybacks. "
"6182790","6188210"," And I think, you know, I think they have a lot more going on for them in other areas, which"
"6188210","6190250"," they want to keep their cash to take advantage of."
"6190250","6191250"," How about energy?"
"6192350","6197550"," You know, there's a sector that for a decade, nobody cared about because it was peak oil and we're"
"6197550","6198110"," all going green."
"6198270","6200150"," And then it's had a nice couple three years here. "
"6200850","6205070"," And now we've got WTI crude oil, you know, back up at almost $84 a barrel."
"6205270","6207230"," Do you guys traffic in the energy space at all?"
"6207810","6213370"," We actually, you know, we actually think oil is headed higher because, yeah, because, you know, the"
"6213370","6218310"," demand for oil as the global economies grow, the demand for oil is going to continue to increase."
"6218310","6220390"," And OPEC is going to continue to limit production. "
"6221390","6224890"," And the transition of it from fossil fuels is going to take a lot of time."
"6225390","6230010"," So we actually think that the oil inflation is here to stay, and that will keep going higher."
"6230550","6235450"," And that benefits some of the larger oil players because their break-even on oil is very low. "
"6235730","6238550"," And then oil at $100 a barrel, they are making a killing."
"6239030","6241370"," A deal does China play into your investment thesis?"
"6242650","6246090"," Certainly China is a major player and, you know, it does have an impact."
"6246090","6252370"," But we find opportunities more domestically in the United States, you know, and especially- I just"
"6252370","6257030"," mean in that they, you know, their economy supports rising prices of oil if it does well. "
"6257370","6257650"," Yes."
"6258030","6259830"," So China is definitely a key player there."
"6260110","6261930"," Global economies, India is a key player. "
"6262650","6266710"," And the U.S. also, you know, the U.S. economy is improving, so that's also increasing the demand"
"6266710","6267170"," for oil."
"6267430","6271890"," So definitely we'd really like some of the larger oil companies that benefit from that."
"6272310","6272830"," Thirty seconds. "
"6273270","6274590"," What do you stand away from here?"
"6275450","6281590"," So, you know, I think that there's a lot of quality investments right now that you can take"
"6281590","6282350"," advantage of."
"6282630","6289210"," So I would stay away from the high-risk, volatile, meme type of investments and just focus more on"
"6289210","6290890"," quality and look at it in pullbacks."
"6291470","6295150"," And like you said, fixed income is giving you also an opportunity over lifetime. "
"6295570","6298670"," You know, one-year T-bill, you're looking at close to 5%."
"6298670","6300570"," You've never seen that in a long time."
"6300570","6300990"," Yeah. "
"6301170","6301750"," It's just amazing."
"6302050","6304670"," I know people that just roll those things over all the time."
"6305090","6305790"," Dale Zaman. "
"6305930","6307090"," He's a partner at Wall Street Alliance."
"6307410","6309410"," We appreciate coming in here live to our Bloomberg."
"6309690","6311030"," They're a broker's studio. "
"6311030","6311890"," Good stuff there."
"6312430","6314930"," Looking at these markets, kind of giving up some of the gains."
"6315190","6315670"," Still positive. "
"6315890","6318850"," We've got the S&P of about seven-tenths of 1% same for the Dow."
"6319430","6320970"," And that's that same there."
"6321270","6326250"," So what kind of a broad move here off of what was a fairly, I guess, in-line inflation data"
"6326250","6328550"," and for those that feel like in-line is okay. "
"6328550","6332710"," That's enough for this Fed to maybe step back a little bit from the rate rise."
"6333210","6333730"," There you go."
"6333870","6335130"," There's all the information you need. "
"6335390","6339750"," Right now, let's head down to Washington, D.C. We'll get to World and National News with Indian"

"6371650","6373350"," adopting due to COVID-19."
"6373630","6376410"," I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing. "
"6376850","6379130"," I think if you vote, you should go."
"6379850","6383410"," And even the concept of early voting is not the greatest."

"6876100","6883600"," Yeah, wait, somebody would be at 12 acre swimming pool?"
"6883600","6884760"," I don't know how big that is."
"6885020","6886240"," It's Texas, so it's big. "
"6886500","6889500"," An acre is quite a bit larger than your average swimming pool."

"6926980","6931220"," It's like everybody I talk to is like, how can you not go to that?"
"6931560","6934740"," I just haven't really ever had time or been allowed by my boss."
"6936000","6937820"," But Hannah is like, it's her job."
"6938500","6939880"," She joins us now. "
"6939880","6944800"," Also, I think preparing to drive a couple of sweet-assed Martins."
"6945360","6948060"," Hannah, talk to us first about the Concourse Delegates."
"6948660","6949940"," I saw your story about it. "
"6950100","6952620"," They're building a big barn for some old Ferraris."
"6952940","6953780"," What's that all about?"
"6955140","6957580"," It's honestly so exciting and cool."
"6957780","6958320"," I'm really excited. "
"6958560","6960380"," I've gone for many years."
"6960580","6965400"," This is the most excited I've been for a while about a bunch of old, rusted out, completely"
"6965400","6968060"," derelict Ferraris that are for sale."
"6968060","6975260"," RM Sotheby's, the auction house, built a barn display to recreate the way that these 20 Ferraris"
"6975260","6978580"," were found in Florida after a hurricane. "
"6978880","6984940"," You might remember in 2004, we saw some pictures of a bunch of Ferraris completely demolished after"
"6984940","6985460"," a hurricane."
"6986080","6988200"," Now we have the Ferraris for sale."
"6988440","6989400"," They've reappeared. "
"6990360","6993800"," They're actually owned by a very eccentric man."
"6993800","7000800"," You might remember Walter Medlin, who's got quite a colorful history back to the 1970s or so."
"7002200","7007400"," These Ferraris are going to go big, even though they're all twisted and completely rusted out. "
"7008040","7009620"," Talk to us about the Concourse Delegates."
"7010000","7012420"," What is it and who goes there?"
"7013160","7015880"," Tell us about why it's so special in the world of high-end automobiles."
"7017280","7020680"," Concourse Delegates is a really snooty way to say a car show. "
"7020680","7028320"," What it is is a bunch of really nice, very well-washed and detailed cars parked on a putting green"
"7028320","7030660"," and a fairway of golf course."
"7031300","7033700"," And on Ocean Avenue and Carmel by the sea."
"7034500","7035140"," Exactly. "
"7035720","7040180"," It's actually on the Pebble Beach Golf Course."
"7040840","7045300"," There is a set amount of cars that are judged, of course."
"7045300","7048500"," You know, this q-tip white glove type judging. "
"7049020","7053000"," But then also throughout the week there are auctions or other car shows."
"7053560","7055640"," You know, thousands and thousands of people come."
"7055840","7057620"," There's kind of something for everybody. "
"7058080","7063080"," There will be car shows just for muscle cars or just for poor shows or just for, I don't know,"
"7063220","7064780"," old trucks from the 70s."
"7064920","7065720"," It's really fun."
"7065960","7073040"," But yes, to your point, the big climax of the week is Sunday's Concourse Delegates, the car show on"
"7073040","7074000"," the Pebble Beach Golf Course. "
"7074000","7074800"," Yeah, it's extraordinary."
"7075300","7076940"," I mean, this is big business, Hannah, right?"
"7077060","7081320"," I mean, I see stories on some of those cars that get bought and sold during the week, and"
"7081320","7084020"," particularly on Sunday, some huge numbers."
"7084040","7085420"," There's real investment here. "
"7086060","7089420"," Yeah, this is kind of like art collecting in a way."
"7089480","7092000"," We're talking about blue chip collectibles here."
"7092200","7099660"," So the most expensive and rare vehicles in the world are bought, showed, shown and displayed. "
"7100820","7106360"," Certainly the auction houses will see easily over $100 million in sales just over the weekend, all"
"7106360","7108780"," told through a three or four days of auctions."
"7109100","7112800"," But you know you have things that, you know, there might be two or three of them in the world,"
"7112940","7114220"," some of the racing Ferraris."
"7114480","7119780"," Of course, we remember the 300 SL goal wings and the Mercedes with the doors that raise up, like a,"
"7119800","7120940"," like a goal wing. "
"7121660","7123540"," So really iconic cars."
"7123920","7129020"," This is the most prestigious car that really, certainly in North America, maybe in the world, you"
"7129020","7133360"," could say there might be a few in Italy that compare, but this really is, if you want to see"
"7133360","7138960"," blue chip cars and the best of the best and the rarest, this is where you go."
"7139180","7145360"," We're showing some of the derelict Ferraris here for those people watching on YouTube or streaming"
"7145360","7146780"," us on Bloomberg.com."
"7147240","7149860"," Some of them look like they're in pretty fantastic shape. "
"7150140","7153940"," Others look like they're about to fall apart from all the rust."
"7153940","7157240"," But they're still expected."
"7157520","7161980"," Even the one that, Hannah, you know the one that's completely crumpled and doesn't have a roof or"
"7161980","7167760"," maybe even wheels, even that is going to go for hundreds of thousands of dollars. "
"7168580","7172560"," Yeah, you know, barn finds are very interesting things."
"7173040","7178820"," From what I hear, the guys that I talked to, really, if you're concerned about money, it's better"
"7178820","7181160"," to just buy the car already done."
"7181160","7188120"," These are not especially, at this point, you know, you're not, you're going to spend a lot of money"
"7188120","7188820"," to bring it back. "
"7189020","7192720"," Maybe even more than you'd spend on a similar car that's already done."
"7193100","7195580"," So it's really, at this point, it's about the story."
"7196040","7196900"," It's about the journey. "
"7197320","7207240"," The people who buy these twisted crumpled cars are people who love the painful relationship of what"
"7207240","7209140"," it takes to bring a car back to life."
"7209140","7212280"," Let me ask you about a new car and that is the DB-12."
"7212280","7216600"," You've already driven the car somewhere else besides America. "
"7217460","7221020"," But you're also going to get some seat time and a couple of Aston Martin's coming up."
"7221400","7224100"," What's the story with this company, where it is and what it's producing?"
"7225420","7231080"," You know, Aston Martin is really fascinating this year for a number of reasons."
"7231440","7235160"," We know that they've really struggled since their IPO in 2018. "
"7235940","7238900"," They've got a very dynamic owner and Lawrence Stroll."
"7239140","7244580"," And of course, Aston Martin is doing fantastic in Formula One right now, which helps a lot, at"
"7244580","7247720"," least from public perception and probably fundraising too."
"7247900","7250940"," Of course, Lawrence Stroll's son is a race car driver as well. "
"7251400","7254100"," So there's a lot of talk about Aston Martin."
"7254520","7259480"," And then when they bring in the DB-12, which is a successor to the DB-11, excellent vehicle,"
"7259480","7262780"," they've got the DBX SUV, the 707."
"7263240","7264520"," I think I'll be in during Monterey. "
"7264840","7266120"," Fantastic SUV."
"7266340","7270520"," I actually think you could cross shop it against the Lamborghini Urus, perhaps."
"7271320","7275180"," And you could throw in the Ferrari Prasangla as well if you wanted. "
"7275580","7280640"," So they're making really competitive products, but also they have really, it's been tough."
"7280840","7282700"," You know, they faced liquidity issues."
"7283420","7288480"," There's been a lot of financial turnover. "
"7288480","7290280"," And turnover and executive turnover."
"7291160","7293880"," Now we also know that they're tied in with Lucid."
"7294320","7296620"," So there's just a lot going on at Aston Martin. "
"7296620","7297820"," It's a really exciting time."
"7298460","7302460"," And I am looking forward to having some time with their executives to get the latest."
"7303560","7304140"," All right. "
"7304280","7304840"," Hannah, great stuff."
"7305600","7306480"," Enjoy Carmel."
"7306600","7307280"," Enjoy Peppa Beach. "
"7307280","7310620"," Maybe get a little veal at Ilfernile on the corner of Ocean Avenue."
"7311480","7312840"," There in Carmel by the C."
"7312960","7314920"," Hannah Ellis, staff writer for Bloomberg Business Week."
"7315380","7316300"," We've got to get you there, dude. "
"7317080","7317520"," Someday."
"7318660","7320300"," And you go from multiple days."
"7320660","7326200"," And as Hannah was saying, all around the Bay, the Monterey Bay area, including Monterey, out in"
"7326200","7329900"," your Salinas, all over the Monterey Bay area, each day will be different shows. "
"7330660","7332140"," And it's not just there."
"7332300","7332720"," So it's just amazing."
"7332980","7334520"," It culminates on Sunday. "
"7334820","7337520"," I mean, the next best thing for me is just having Hannah cover it."
"7337660","7340180"," Because then I read all of her coverage and get deep in it."
"7340420","7345620"," So I feel like if she's out there writing about it, maybe creating some video content as well. "
"7346160","7347720"," That's good enough for me for now."
"7347940","7349500"," And then one day when I retire, maybe."
"7349760","7350560"," No, please. "
"7350740","7351300"," You can go out there."
"7351700","7352540"," I'll make it happen."
"7352540","7352860"," Don't worry. "
"7352980","7353680"," I know a couple of people."
"7353880","7354580"," We'll have more coming up."
"7354800","7355280"," This is Bloomberg. "
"7357800","7359860"," Let's get some company news right now, Steve Rappaport."
"7359980","7365300"," All shares of Novo Nordisk are down more than 1% after the drug maker disclosed that supplies of"
"7365300","7366940"," its blockbuster obesity medicine."
"7367120","7372420"," Well, Govey will remain restricted in the U.S. CEO Lars Fergard Jorenson tells Bloomberg he's not"
"7372420","7373660"," concerned about supply issues. "
"7373660","7376720"," This is a really unique opportunity for Novo Nordisk."
"7376860","7384400"," We have seen tremendous willingness to use our obesity medicine, not least in the U.S. but also in"
"7384400","7385280"," Europe where we have launched."
"7386020","7391520"," We have this week announced a set of really attractive carvascular data, not yet in the label. "
"7391780","7392680"," So we cannot promote them."
"7393240","7395520"," So this is just going to push the remains even bigger."
"7396040","7401400"," The data Jorenson is referring to is from a study that shows use of Wagobi for obese patients,"
"7401400","7404160"," reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes. "
"7404820","7408360"," A tech giant reverses course in the wave of job cuts plaguing the industry."
"7408780","7410080"," More from Bloomberg's Kimberly Adams."
"7410600","7412840"," Steve, it's a boomerang effect over at Meta. "
"7413140","7417540"," The company is looking now to rehire many people that laid off several months ago."
"7418160","7422640"," Meta shed 25% of its workforce in multiple rounds of cuts that ended in May."
"7423140","7427880"," Those layoffs are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan for what he calls a year of efficiency. "
"7427880","7434440"," Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has picked up pace, rehiring dozens of workers in engineering and"

"7920740","7924440"," And I don't think you can even have that argument when you're talking about a lot of these things. "

"8067800","8073060"," The S&P right now up 16 points on the CPI Thursday, a gain of 4 tenths of one percent."
"8073420","8074900"," Dow industrials up 160."

"8120700","8123640"," He also admitted that the path to a soft landing is widening. "
"8123640","8128400"," Now, if that is taken recession out of their forecast, we took it out two months before they did,"
"8128420","8129740"," so I guess that's good news."
"8130440","8135760"," But there's still a sharp slowdown coming, and that's, you know, something we'll have to deal with."

"8210620","8211360"," Billy, what are you looking at?"
"8211559","8211900"," Yeah."
"8212080","8217660"," Still seeing quite a bit of weakness for tapestry after the deal to acquire. "
"8222639","8223000"," I'm sorry."
"8225959","8231840"," The biggest driver to the upside though among them is Disney after quarterly results showcasing"
"8232719","8237020"," cost cuts, which will be interesting ahead of News Corp results after the bell today."
"8237580","8242500"," So getting a bit more detail, Paul, as you mentioned in your neck of the woods within the media"
"8242500","8242740"," space. "
"8242740","8244299"," One stock that does stand out though."
"8244660","8245219"," Yeti Holdings."
"8245500","8247260"," I don't know if you guys are huge Yeti fan. "
"8247480","8250000"," I'm a big owner of Yeti products."
"8250180","8251700"," Full disclosure here."
"8251700","8252860"," I've got the cooler. "
"8253120","8259840"," I've got a couple of the tumbler stock up 21% right now after better than expected second quarter"
"8259840","8263379"," results boosting their forecast for earnings for the year."
"8263740","8268340"," So biggest intraday percentage gain since November trading at the highest since February analysts"
"8268340","8270180"," across Wall Street really praising those results."
"8270219","8270360"," All right. "
"8270660","8272540"," It is ridiculous how good those products are."
"8272740","8276400"," I'll put the water in my Yeti little container."
"8276799","8277480"," Go to the beach. "
"8277480","8283620"," I can barely touch the exterior of the bottle because it's so hot from the sun on the beach."
"8283700","8285540"," Drink the water ice cold."
"8285959","8290639"," But why is, why is Yeti the only name we know?"
"8290959","8292900"," Because we grew up with Coleman. "
"8293480","8293600"," Yeah."
"8293920","8294180"," Yeah."
"8295040","8295299"," It glue. "
"8295840","8296240"," That's the one."
"8296280","8296459"," Exactly."
"8296959","8302280"," And they don't, I don't know if they make the same kind of products, but there are other cooler"
"8302280","8307299"," makers who make, I think what's called Roto molded coolers, right?"
"8308440","8309740"," Arctic coolers is one. "
"8310500","8311840"," Orca is another."
"8312340","8315680"," I'm pretty sure Pelican makes them as well."
"8315940","8316639"," I don't. "
"8316639","8318860"," But you don't see anything besides Yeti."
"8318940","8321879"," If you go to an REI for example, it's all about Yeti."
"8322100","8326520"," Well, even if you go to Dick's Sporting Goods or Lowe's and Home Depot, there's an entire Yeti"
"8326520","8331000"," section, wine tumblers, the regular tumblers, mega ones that are like. "
"8331160","8333700"," My brother's fiance has a Yeti martini glass."
"8334000","8336520"," You're like, no, she's welcome in the family."
"8337459","8337980"," Exactly. "
"8338559","8340340"," It's essential to her lifestyle."
"8341160","8343639"," It's a lifestyle aspirational brand."
"8344280","8345080"," Well, it's interesting too. "
"8345219","8346360"," They make backpacks now."
"8346500","8347080"," They make clothing."
"8347440","8352340"," It seems like they're really branching out into kind of the mainstream consumer goods outside of"
"8352340","8352920"," just coolers. "
"8352920","8357420"," Because I remember at one point when the stock was trading down back in 2021, it peaked above 107"
"8357420","8358799"," bucks right now below 50."
"8359320","8362340"," And we were kind of calling out like how many tumblers can a person buy?"
"8362600","8363680"," I mean, my brother's got the backpack."
"8363879","8368040"," He's got the 12 pack cooler, but like other than once you hit kind of. "
"8368040","8374080"," Now, does your brother also wear a white baseball cap and talk about his frat all the time and have"
"8374080","8375139"," an old rose subscription?"
"8375660","8379520"," No, my brother's actually the he's in now blue collar working class."
"8379520","8382680"," So he's one of the construction guys who has the cooler loaded up for."
"8382940","8383500"," You got to have that. "
"8383600","8384379"," They have it too."
"8384520","8390940"," But I just I always feel like I risk if I put a Yeti sticker on my truck or, you"
"8390940","8396640"," know, if I wear the hat, I risk being lumped in with that whole, you know, good old boy crowd."
"8397020","8397440"," I don't know. "
"8397800","8398620"," Aren't you a good old boy?"
"8398920","8400260"," I don't go to SEC games."
"8400680","8402580"," You know, I love going to SEC game."
"8402580","8406880"," But I feel like yet he's interesting because it has that kind of, you know, fraternity vibe, but"
"8406880","8410700"," also the like construction fire fire police officer. "
"8411260","8411700"," True."
"8411900","8413180"," Yeah, look at that chart."
"8413380","8417720"," That's another pandemic chart stock, you know, in 2020 just started ripping. "
"8417720","8422620"," You know, one from like 20 bucks up to a hundred bucks and like a lot of those pandemic stocks"
"8422620","8425680"," at the end of 2021 were peaked kind of coming down ever since."
"8425680","8429940"," Another stock in focus, though, and Matt, I want to your opinion on luxury, not luxury, Ralph"
"8429940","8434420"," Lauren right now down two and a half percent falling for the fifth straight session after they"
"8434420","8437600"," reported quarterly results that had a light to cue forecast."
"8438180","8439580"," Our fills call him a luxury brand. "
"8439780","8441020"," Ralph Lauren, luxury or not luxury?"
"8441340","8444920"," I mean, to my mind, it's a staple horse to my mind."
"8444940","8448920"," It's a sort of staple of the upper middle class, right?"
"8448920","8452500"," And they do make higher end products."
"8452640","8462000"," The purple label is one, they have RRL, but they don't actually achieve full luxury, I think,"
"8462080","8469480"," because, for example, RRL likes flight jackets and, you know, Japanese denim kind of products,"
"8470260","8472140"," workwear sort of stuff. "
"8472140","8477140"," They don't really have the quality that the truly good brands in that space have."
"8477360","8478220"," They just have the design."
"8478480","8478740"," All right. "
"8478840","8483840"," It's a $8 billion market cap up about 18% year to date and down 2.7% today on"
"8483840","8485160"," the, I guess, on that print, right?"
"8485420","8485660"," Yeah."
"8485800","8486400"," After those results."
"8486820","8486860"," Yeah. "
"8487440","8491300"," One of the things that I thought was interesting is that they derive half of it, more than half"
"8491300","8492980"," their sales outside of North America."
"8493160","8493560"," Really?"
"8493760","8495460"," That's a brand making up of the chunk of that."
"8495460","8502000"," I would be really fascinated to see now that China's opening up air travel for its, or loosening,"
"8502080","8509720"," and I guess a little bit for its, you know, people, whether we'll see an outflow of Chinese just"
"8509720","8510620"," visitors and travel. "
"8510900","8513200"," Do they have the same pent up kind of revenge travel?"
"8513200","8515660"," You know, they're allowing group travel."
"8516000","8516120"," Yes."
"8516300","8521980"," So they're allowing, like, tour groups now to leave China for destinations like the US. "
"8521980","8526960"," So I guess that's a good first step, but maybe we'll be seeing some more Chinese friends here in"
"8526960","8527960"," the big city shopping."
"8528580","8529920"," Some of those big luxury stores."
"8530060","8530840"," We certainly like to see that. "
"8531100","8531680"," Anything else, Belly?"
"8532040","8534840"," Hawaiian holding is down 4% this all coming after that."
"8535460","8535860"," Maui."
"8536040","8540420"," So we're keeping an eye on that, obviously, not a positive update in terms of kind of the news"
"8540420","8543200"," that's coming out of there, but keeping an eye on that story is unbelievable. "
"8543760","8544240"," The fires."
"8544580","8549200"," A, I never remember seeing them hearing about fires in Hawaii before."
"8549200","8552920"," No, I don't know if this is a new thing, but boy, and just the destruction of that beautiful area. "
"8553000","8555700"," I guess it's on Maui, you know, crazy story."
"8555960","8560640"," The former capital of Hawaii has been decimated."
"8560900","8561960"," Yeah, it's just terrible news. "
"8562420","8564380"," All right, Belly, thanks so much for joining us here."
"8564500","8567160"," Belly Lipschitz covers all the markets for Bloomberg news."
"8567860","8570040"," I want to talk about endowments. "
"8570540","8574600"," I know a thing or two amount of demos having worked on some boards of schools, and for a lot"
"8574600","8576160"," of schools, it's the lifeblood."
"8576160","8579240"," It kind of supports the economics of the school."
"8580040","8582880"," And some of these big universities report their endowment numbers pretty publicly. "
"8583180","8587240"," And Janet Lauren, higher education finance reporter for Bloomberg News joins us here on our"
"8587240","8588760"," Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio."
"8589180","8593960"," How did some of these big universities do in this last fiscal year, which I guess ends in June"
"8593960","8594460"," 30th?"
"8594580","8594760"," Yes."
"8595060","8600160"," So we'll be starting to hear more school specific returns coming up in the next month or two. "
"8600260","8600440"," Okay."
"8600440","8601640"," We get a good snapshot."
"8602820","8607840"," And the median is 8.7%, which might sound like a terrific return, but we have to keep in mind"
"8607840","8608440"," inflation. "
"8609700","8616720"," So while you have to factor in spending and also what schools are paying out in terms of inflation,"
"8616980","8622660"," they're also paying higher costs for everything from construction to professor salaries, or even"
"8622660","8624000"," paying more in financial aid."
"8624800","8629580"," So those, it may sound like a great return, but a lot of it is being eaten up by inflation."
"8629980","8634880"," I have to imagine financial aid spending has gone way up over the past couple of decades. "
"8635600","8640280"," Because so many, I mean, I focus on the schools of the big endowments that you write about, you"
"8640280","8646440"," know, so many of those schools have hardly any students who are paying full tuition."
"8646440","8652280"," Well, a lot of the schools have been trying to make a concerted effort, you know, to showing"
"8652280","8656300"," Congress and the federal government that they are attracting lower income students."
"8656680","8662880"," Harvard said this year, 25% of their entire freshman class, it has an income of 85,000 or below,"
"8663320","8668980"," and they're giving more financial aid for students who are trying to have a more diverse and"
"8668980","8670360"," economically diverse class. "
"8671340","8673100"," You like Columbia University, don't you?"
"8673400","8674500"," Yes, I did go to school there."
"8675100","8680280"," Undergrat of Columbia, Masters in Journalism Columbia, then a Spencer Fellow for Columbia, which"
"8680280","8681780"," you finished this year, what is that?"
"8682760","8686580"," So that is a reporting fellowship looking into education reporting."
"8686960","8688960"," Everyone comes in here is so much smarter than we are. "
"8689120","8693920"," I mean, like everyone from Blumelow's, and I'm just like, he's coming, all right, so going back to"
"8693920","8699060"," your story here, I mean talk to us about endowments, how important are they to these schools,"
"8699320","8705140"," because it just seems like I do a lot of work with Duke and they're great returns."
"8706580","8710240"," And it's such a big supporter of everything they try to do."
"8710700","8712640"," But some schools, most schools, don't have that. "
"8712900","8713040"," Right."
"8713240","8717040"," Well, and there's a handful of schools that are extremely reliant on the returns."
"8717360","8722800"," Schools like Princeton and Amherst rely on more than half their entire budgets from endowments. "
"8722800","8724660"," I think in some cases they're 60%."
"8724660","8728060"," But you know, when you look at smaller schools, their endowments are smaller."
"8728480","8733040"," They're in US equities and you know, they did much better for their returns this year, given that"
"8733040","8735680"," equities were up about 18% in the period. "
"8736520","8737740"," It just depends on the school."
"8738640","8745860"," And as you know, long-term returns were about 6% for the 10-year average, which is not a"
"8745860","8749160"," great return considering inflation and what they're spending."
"8749620","8752720"," They actually have to earn a lot more in order to keep pace. "
"8753500","8756860"," So you know, we'll see as these numbers come out how the schools are doing."
"8757120","8758720"," Last year was a terrible year."
"8759080","8761380"," The worst year in return since the Great Recession. "
"8761380","8763440"," But here's my big but here."
"8763900","8768460"," Alternative investments are, particularly for the larger endowments, are a huge percentage."
"8768780","8773040"," And it would shocks people how much they're putting into hedge funds, private equity, private"
"8773040","8777640"," credit, 30, 40% of their endowments are putting into these things, which don't have more. "
"8777820","8778260"," Probably more."
"8778420","8779060"," Some of the bigger ones."
"8779400","8780400"," They don't have liquidity. "
"8780960","8781520"," That's the downside."
"8782220","8782940"," But they make returns."
"8783500","8785520"," Okay, there's a thing called market to market. "
"8786380","8788040"," They did not mark the market."
"8788340","8790920"," The down 20, 25% year we had last year."
"8791160","8792760"," I didn't see it anywhere in the endowments. "
"8793080","8793480"," Why?"
"8793540","8794580"," Why would they have to?"
"8794720","8795720"," It's not the same as a bank."
"8796280","8797620"," No, but it's an endowment."
"8798120","8801520"," And I would think they would have marked a market regulations as well. "
"8801940","8803080"," I don't believe they do."
"8803180","8804040"," I don't believe they do."
"8804120","8805380"," And that's why. "
"8805780","8811520"," And it's interesting because I kept when I listened to the board meeting and I was like, okay, but"
"8811520","8816360"," what about the 40% we got in, you know, some leveraged thing that's in Zimbabwe or something, some,"
"8816460","8817580"," you know, zinc mine."
"8818100","8818760"," Where's that?"
"8819180","8822260"," You know, well, most of the larger schools, you're absolutely right."
"8822400","8823700"," And mostly in alternatives. "
"8823880","8829560"," And that was a big shift starting in the late 80s, early 90s when David Swenson, the late CIO at"
"8829560","8833440"," Yale, decided that schools could get a better premium for illiquidity."
"8833740","8837900"," And most schools really, the big ones shied away from US equities."
"8838680","8841700"," And in some years, it's really paid off in this year. "
"8841920","8847560"," And in years past, you've seen smaller endowments with larger shares in US equities have much"
"8847560","8848060"," better returns."
"8848420","8851760"," And of course, they're not paying the fees that alternatives command."
"8852260","8855560"," Well, tuitions across the board continue to rise though, right Janet?"
"8855920","8857740"," And how long can that happen?"
"8857860","8863280"," Especially as we, as it becomes a national issue, that people owe so much money in student debt. "
"8863980","8868640"," Well, I think 20 years ago, we would have been surprised at the price tag that it keeps continuing"
"8868640","8869180"," to rise."
"8869460","8875420"," Now, however, if you look at the share of student loans, the most, the most biggest share is not"
"8875420","8876480"," actually for college."
"8876760","8880980"," It's for graduate school because you can really borrow a lot up to the cost of attendance for"
"8880980","8886460"," graduate school, which could be, you know, 80, $90,000 in a year for a federal student loan for"
"8886460","8892760"," your freshman year, you're only, you're limited to $5,500, $6,500 in the second year and $7,500 in"
"8892760","8893540"," the third and fourth year. "
"8894160","8897740"," So the biggest share of student debt is really from graduate school."
"8897920","8898080"," Yes."
"8898620","8899660"," Yeah, there's limits. "
"8900100","8903460"," You know, Dr. Joel Fleischman had $125,000 of debt."
"8903760","8907680"," Did he really, he put it off in Alaska, which is why he had to go to Alaska."
"8908020","8908460"," Exactly. "
"8908580","8910260"," He went to Columbia Medical School."
"8910260","8910540"," That's right."
"8910800","8911640"," I remember that show. "
"8911800","8913580"," The show is called Northern Exposure."
"8913700","8914140"," Right?"
"8914240","8915460"," So it's now on Netflix."
"8915620","8916920"," There's a writing campaign. "
"8917360","8918200"," I just bought it."
"8918640","8923180"," You know, I've been searching for it for years and I could never find a lot more service."
"8923580","8923880"," He's a guy. "
"8923960","8927560"," I follow him on Twitter because he does a lot of really good stuff, including he's on billions now."
"8928140","8933120"," But I follow him on Twitter and he's saying everywhere I go, people say, how come Northern exposure"
"8933120","8934040"," is not on Netflix?"
"8934520","8938260"," I just bought it $60 for the whole first season."
"8938560","8939180"," It's very expensive. "
"8939440","8939580"," Really?"
"8939720","8940900"," Can you send that password to me?"
"8941160","8941320"," Yes."
"8941980","8943900"," But there's a password sharing."
"8944360","8944500"," All right. "
"8945400","8949300"," Talk just about, I mean, I've got my last of my offspring, my four offspring going to this freshman"
"8949300","8951240"," year college, a private university."
"8952040","8953540"," The tuition starts with an eight."
"8954060","8954900"," Oh, my goodness. "
"8955440","8955760"," Exactly."
"8956000","8957740"," I'm just like, holy cow."
"8957920","8959540"," And there's no ended site is there?"
"8960320","8960880"," It's me. "
"8960980","8962120"," It's going to take an act of Congress."
"8963120","8965460"," School in Europe because it doesn't make any sense to me."
"8965660","8971780"," Well, and when we talk about student loans in, you know, you hear this chatter about $10,000, which"
"8971780","8973300"," of course is not happening. "
"8973300","8977260"," It didn't, it never addressed the root cause, which is the increasing cost of college."
"8977940","8978960"," So you're right."
"8979220","8981280"," There, there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. "
"8981700","8983180"," And there's no real regulation."
"8983560","8988540"," And when schools are when you're looking at default rates for colleges, they're never on the hook."
"8989060","8990580"," Yeah, they don't have skin in the game. "
"8990800","8992040"," Yeah, it's just extraordinary."
"8992220","8995860"," It doesn't feel like, I mean, it's the best university system in the world, arguably."

"9105880","9108360"," that there is affordability of coverage."
"9108980","9110600"," So definitely there's an opportunity there. "
"9111060","9115360"," But if we don't work with governments, I think there is also limit to the opportunity that we can"
"9115360","9115620"," see."

"9241950","9244290"," So I'll point your attention to a couple things here."
"9244370","9245930"," Okay, we're going to do a quick walk around the market."
"9246450","9251530"," Coming down here, we've got a small gap filled down below on spoos. "
"9252490","9257090"," If you follow my cursor on the bottom left hand side, I believe on your screen."
"9258530","9260430"," Bear with me, I don't have my headphones on."
"9261430","9263930"," Watching this hourly just curl down right here. "
"9265030","9267030"," Watching this one curl down to curl up."
"9267330","9268470"," Five minutes curling down as well."
"9269450","9270490"," Just watching for that swoop. "
"9270490","9276610"," One of the biggest things that you're looking for here is this lower low back carrier yesterday."
"9277550","9280650"," You're just looking for this nice swoop come up and right here."
"9281370","9281830"," The upside. "
"9285450","9287830"," Going to go through the rest of the market really quick."
"9290110","9293650"," And I can get it from it."
"9295650","9296830"," Switch over to something. "
"9300780","9301800"," One quick second."
"9305500","9308460"," We will full chart right here."
"9309780","9313760"," I'm just going to bounce around the market and show you a few things here. "
"9316500","9321090"," We'll put this in a 15 minute chart."
"9322930","9326550"," So you can kind of see this gap down below here for HYG to close up."
"9327930","9333810"," That would also confirm that maybe more dips in store here. "
"9333990","9334270"," See that?"
"9334750","9335970"," Close all this gap up."
"9336630","9338030"," Still moving to the upside though."
"9338810","9343650"," So just don't be looking at any weakness and spoos as don't buy the dip. "
"9343830","9344290"," That kind of stuff."
"9344990","9346290"," That's HYG really quick."
"9346770","9347670"," Just so you can see it. "
"9348750","9350790"," I'm going to show you VIX really quick as well."
"9350790","9359840"," So if you get that swoop down right in HYG you'd also see"
"9359840","9361900"," kind of a move higher here."
"9363040","9363320"," Right?"
"9363960","9366880"," And now I'll show VIX trading up here and up here possibly. "
"9367400","9371160"," I would give that swoop down in HYG and that swoop down in spoos."
"9372900","9376110"," I'm going to show you Dixie next."
"9377750","9378310"," Dixie. "
"9380730","9382270"," See you can see it right here."
"9383570","9388550"," Dixie also showing that same kind of a move to the upside right down and then up."
"9388730","9391470"," So you make it a bounce here but then a roll and then pick up. "
"9391610","9391770"," Okay."
"9391910","9393450"," So that's Dixie showing the same thing."
"9396370","9397930"," I'm also an NDX. "
"9399790","9405630"," I'm going to a five minute chart."
"9406710","9410810"," I don't know why it's not showing it here but it's NDLS."
"9411450","9412190"," Wrong ticker. "
"9412190","9416330"," I can hate that weebel doesn't show that."
"9416550","9417290"," So just down here."
"9419530","9423890"," You can see this small gap down here that needs to get filled right there. "
"9425230","9427610"," Dixie still has a little bit of filling to do down here."
"9428490","9435510"," I think that's all four of them right there."
"9435670","9442830"," So just on those four, based on those four right there, small gap to fill right here on spoos. "
"9444250","9450570"," Just looking for that weakness down here on Nasdaq."
"9450810","9452930"," Even if it bounces, it still comes down."
"9453850","9456230"," And so pay attention to this previous low over here. "
"9456790","9457710"," I'm going to move that over."
"9458010","9462110"," You don't want to see the previous low right here."
"9463090","9464670"," Is that up for you right now?"
"9467370","9471230"," I think that's the lowest point we've had this week. "
"9471230","9472670"," Yeah, that's the low right there."
"9477720","9479460"," I'll leave that up for you right now as well."
"9479740","9482920"," I'm going to get back to what I'm doing but I want to check in with you guys because of"
"9482920","9485520"," some weakness here and I'm trying to add to a position for next Friday. "
"9485800","9487600"," So put your eyes down here."
"9487740","9489020"," If it does come supine down here."
"9494370","9498900"," I'm going to move stuff over for you. "
"9505410","9508230"," You can see that supply down there."
"9509430","9511810"," I'm going to leave both of these open right here for you."
"9513770","9527060"," I'll put it there in a"
"9527060","9527420"," second here. "
"9534170","9534950"," That's all right."
"9541630","9558860"," I'm adding"
"9558860","9560420"," here at 18 cents right now."
"9561060","9562320"," I'm going to add 18 cents. "
"9562540","9564200"," I think I bought 32 or 33."
"9564660","9566020"," I'm going to add 18 right here."
"9566020","9567560"," If I have to add 10, I'll add it right there. "
"9568140","9570600"," I'm still still looking for that 460."
"9571400","9572080"," It's next Friday."
"9580200","9581380"," Someone just said no bounce. "
"9581800","9583900"," I think you need to scroll out from a one minute chart."
"9592330","9593450"," All right, I'm right back."
"9593630","9594210"," I got to get back to me. "
"9609450","9611890"," Okay, so just watch my cursor one more time."
"9612010","9613090"," I want to show you guys one more time."
"9613350","9614850"," I want to go over here and show you guys something here. "
"9615450","9619170"," I'm watching some of the chat comments that sound like a second here."
"9622030","9623750"," I'm going to get over the trigger screen."
"9624710","9626610"," So here's the trigger screen right there. "
"9627130","9628890"," I want to watch you guys to watch this here, okay?"
"9629770","9633890"," So just as you're watching me, watch my clock cursor closely, okay?"
"9635530","9637030"," By the depth, by the depth."
"9637390","9639430"," Looking for that next one here to by the depth, okay?"
"9640150","9640990"," Just right in there."
"9642370","9643470"," You see it down there?"
"9643650","9645930"," One, two, one, two. "
"9646690","9647350"," Same thing right here."
"9647350","9648930"," Coming into it right now."
"9653940","9655700"," You get some bear drama down here. "
"9655860","9656940"," It's no real big deal."
"9657760","9659100"," Actually, I just bought that too."
"9659240","9660420"," So we're looking pretty good. "
"9662240","9665950"," You see that nice little dip by right there?"
"9677340","9678800"," Some of you guys like living..."
"9678800","9683720"," I guess some of you guys are trading like one second tickers or one second time frames or something"
"9683720","9684180"," like that."
"9686040","9687040"," All right, I'll be back."
"9704100","9708100"," I'm going to add 11 or 12 cents or something like that for another pack. "
"9708260","9710800"," I'm going to try to get in for like 100 contracts all day long."
"9711660","9713660"," So if there's any more like gifts down here."
"9714100","9714840"," So if there's any like..."
"9715200","9716020"," You don't get the bounce. "
"9716240","9717560"," Like I bought this right here."
"9718640","9720380"," But if they like do some..."
"9720380","9721400"," I didn't catch this one."
"9722440","9723040"," I was in a meeting. "
"9724260","9727380"," But I was in here trying to get some headphone stuff."
"9728640","9730400"," If you give me that bounce, I'll take it."
"9730400","9732120"," You give me that bounce like pitch leige. "
"9732200","9733420"," Any kind of nonsense down here?"
"9733740","9734700"," I really don't care."
"9735040","9738820"," So this is for a weekend plus seven day trade."
"9739320","9744420"," So we kind of this kind of drama stuff you ever see. "
"9744500","9748300"," Especially when you're rolling up, not rolling down or rolling up."
"9748620","9750320"," You're going to see stuff like this, right?"
"9751320","9752880"," This is like an action of dealers."
"9753360","9755920"," These are people selling puts or buying calls. "
"9757340","9758360"," They're not going to give you the best price."
"9758360","9764600"," So if I can get in here for like a DC of like 13 to 15, 18 cents, something like"
"9764600","9767120"," that into next Friday, I'm going to be happy."
"9768280","9769180"," Like zero date day trading. "
"9769880","9773620"," I just saw a couple of comments in the chat about like, I thought this would hold."
"9774200","9775360"," You're still looking for..."
"9776160","9777900"," You're still looking for this stuff."
"9778560","9780880"," This bellow to be where it should be. "
"9781100","9781560"," See it right here?"
"9782460","9784300"," Look down on the bottom left hand side of your chart."
"9784440","9785780"," You're still looking for a bellow to match up."
"9786480","9787220"," That's where your edges. "
"9787220","9790500"," It's not the HT on its own."
"9791060","9796660"," But the second issue here too is we talk about this a lot inside of our streams, right?"
"9797720","9801860"," You guys should already know here and here."
"9803260","9807280"," You already know what you're looking for for a reversal to even take a trade, right?"
"9807880","9811020"," So if you box down here and you reject right here, right?"
"9811600","9812620"," You're bouncing around here. "
"9812640","9815320"," You're still looking for that white line to come up."
"9815320","9819000"," And for price to show you the way higher, right?"
"9819140","9822240"," So you're not even entering trades unless you're up here."
"9822260","9822920"," Does that make sense?"
"9823220","9826140"," So this should be a little bit like, yeah, I bought the dip and it started selling on me. "
"9826480","9830520"," If you're doing that, you're taking losing trades probably nine out of ten times."
"9830860","9832280"," Even if we do go up there."
"9832480","9833420"," Even if that were to hold. "
"9834080","9835520"," You guys understand that point behind that?"
"9836120","9838340"," So if you're trying to buy a dip or anything like that."
"9838840","9840180"," So even where we are right now, right?"
"9841000","9841620"," You've got..."
"9841620","9843800"," You've got buyers here, right?"
"9843800","9846860"," What do buyers need right here for you to take along?"
"9847400","9850660"," You might have a trade from here to here, right?"
"9851160","9856260"," But you don't have a trade that's going to pay until you confirm the reversal on that one minute,"
"9856260","9856520"," right?"
"9856800","9857420"," You already know that."
"9857620","9861060"," Like you don't need me to tell you that, any of that kind of stuff. "
"9861440","9865380"," So it's starting to round out here too."
"9865520","9867020"," It's bottoming at some point here."
"9867240","9868320"," So it shouldn't be too much longer. "
"9870360","9871380"," Well, we'll do it."
"9871440","9873260"," We have to do a show or a recording or something."
"9874040","9875660"," Oh, I thought I've done a couple of these. "
"9875940","9879360"," I know that I go over this every day in stream."
"9879660","9882120"," So we'll go over it again."
"9882700","9883240"," I'll be right back. "
"9884380","9887420"," Oh, I still got some crazy, I got some crazy means I got to do today."
"19288830","19289950"," You know what's checked?"
"19290690","19292930"," Banks make you have credit to Bill's credit."
"19293370","19294330"," You can switch to Corin. "
"19294510","19295990"," It's banking that builds your credit."
"19296470","19297190"," There are no credit checks."
"19297190","19299850"," Plus, you get paid up to two days faster with direct deposit. "

"19327990","19328950"," Ever important for retail. "
"19329690","19334870"," And this one indicator isn't enough to say that there's anything drastic that's going to happen to"
"19334870","19337230"," consumer spending between now and the end of the year."
"19337930","19338490"," Hmm."
"19339490","19339990"," Why is that?"
"19340690","19345090"," Well, just, I mean, like the price increases that have been happening. "
"19345650","19350370"," They do, especially in the things that impact their discretionary spending."
"19350370","19354310"," Those are leveling off, which is great news for everybody."
"19354930","19360790"," I think what's more important to watch is we have the consumer, the student loan debt repayment"
"19360790","19361650"," starting up. "
"19362150","19368450"," That could potentially show up in things like Halloween spending, for example, that might be an"
"19368450","19371010"," important leading indicator going into the holiday season."
"19371010","19377510"," If consumer is a very discretionary kind of spend and it's exactly the kind of spend that is made"
"19377510","19381030"," by the people who are going to be most impacted by that kind of that repayment."
"19381530","19386610"," Those are the kinds of things that we're looking at to understand how much there is the impact on"
"19386610","19390110"," consumer spending going into that all important holiday season. "
"19390330","19392570"," I have to say, just one anecdotal individual."
"19393450","19394530"," Things are still expensive."
"19394750","19398510"," And I feel that when I go to the grocery store, I feel like everything in my world just doesn't"
"19398510","19398710"," matter. "
"19398890","19399270"," It's expensive."
"19399990","19401110"," Supercore prices, Molly."
"19401370","19405030"," I want to come back to that because I saw on the blog this morning, I think it might have"
"19405030","19409750"," been Ari Jersey or somebody else pointing out, which is supercore prices, closely watched by the"
"19409750","19409970"," Fed. "
"19410630","19415110"," When it comes to inflation, rose in the 12 months through July in the first acceleration this year."
"19415670","19420630"," It's services, service prices is minus energy and housing, right?"
"19421750","19424930"," Which follows a June reading that increased at the slowest pace in 18 months."
"19424930","19428310"," So it sounds a little erratic down and then up. "
"19428450","19430770"," So do you disregard it or how do you see that?"
"19431050","19435650"," I mean, I think that's kind of the overall story of inflation as a whole, right?"
"19436130","19439510"," We've all known that the path down to 2% is going to be long and it's going to be"
"19439510","19439930"," bumpy."
"19440090","19446490"," So I would put this in that same camp and the increase in June that was the smallest in 18"
"19446490","19446730"," months."
"19446930","19449050"," So that was 4%. "
"19449050","19453890"," This month was 4.1. So kind of like, okay, not really split hairs."
"19454250","19458330"," Yeah, it's kind of like the same with the headline being up 3-2 this month."
"19458490","19462410"," It was up 3% last month and a lot of that due to base effects conversation. "
"19463010","19466150"," But there is something to effect that as we get closer to that 2%, right?"
"19466250","19469250"," It's tougher in terms of bringing the inflation down?"
"19469410","19474270"," Yeah, and it's going to be in exactly those supercore core services, ex-housing categories that are"
"19474270","19474790"," the most concerning."
"19475250","19477230"," Those are the ones that are the stickiest price pressures."
"19477230","19483910"," And a lot of the disinflation we've had so far has been kind of the unwinding of the pandemic"
"19483910","19485290"," inflation pressures that we had. "
"19485490","19488710"," It's been some easing of the pressures from the war in Ukraine."
"19489130","19494010"," So it's still debatable of how much the Fed's work has really brought about disinflation."
"19494090","19495370"," That's a really good point. "
"19495510","19500950"," And I want to ask Nikki what her thoughts or concerns are when it comes to energy prices on the"
"19500950","19501390"," rise again?"
"19502350","19507790"," Yeah, I mean, again, from a consumer spending perspective, anything that eats up that discretionary"
"19507790","19512610"," budget is going to be the things that really drive whether or not consumers spend."
"19512830","19518790"," I think what we've seen up till now is that consumers have been willing to accumulate debt in order"
"19518790","19520670"," to keep and maintain their spending levels."
"19520930","19521830"," And I think it's a great point. "
"19522130","19527250"," They're spending just as much, but net-wise, they're actually buying less because their purchase"
"19527250","19530830"," power just doesn't go as far with all these sustained high prices."
"19530830","19538630"," But I think that that idea of being able to continue to finance some of this consumer spending with"
"19538630","19544650"," some of the debt that consumers have been using before, that's starting to come to an end, energy"
"19544650","19545090"," prices."
"19545690","19550330"," And again, the interest rate on that credit card debt, all of that stuff is going to come into play"
"19550330","19556650"," much more in terms of where consumers can go and how they can continue to impact and support the"
"19556650","19556930"," economy. "
"19556930","19561330"," Following up on that, Nikki, we actually had the CEO advantage score in here today."
"19561330","19565170"," They're a provider of credit scores to millions of Americans."
"19565750","19568930"," And he was making a lot of similar points that you were just saying. "
"19568930","19573610"," And something that he's actually said on Bloomberg TV before is that the resumption of student loan"
"19573610","19579470"," payments get this is going to have a bigger impact on Americans than a federal rate increase."
"19579470","19585130"," So a 125 basis point increase has less of an effect on the resumption of payments."
"19585170","19586290"," I mean, that makes sense. "
"19586550","19591250"," But if you think about what the average student loan payment is, it's worth exactly."
"19591610","19596050"," So if you're not spending that money, if you don't have that money anymore because it's going to"
"19596050","19598550"," student loan payments, then it's not going to goods and services."
"19599010","19601650"," Nikki, what do you think about that?"
"19601790","19604590"," You think he's on it with the terms of the comparison there?"
"19605310","19606530"," Yeah, I totally agree. "
"19606530","19612310"," I mean, I think the basis points rates, those increases take a little bit of time before they"
"19612310","19614210"," actually filter down to the consumer."
"19614470","19617310"," It's not like today it was this and the Fed raises it."
"19617430","19621150"," And then the very next day that's impacting the rate that consumers are paying. "
"19621450","19623110"," It takes a little while for that to flow through."
"19623730","19627590"," But that loan repayment, that's like immediate budget."
"19627810","19629330"," It doesn't matter what the interest rate is. "
"19629510","19633570"," It's a repayment on something that you were able to take off the table in terms of budget before"
"19633570","19635530"," that now you have to put right back in."
"19635530","19640250"," So if you combine adding that in and then you look at those other factors that can potentially"
"19640250","19647390"," impact consumer spending, like energy prices, like housing prices, the shelter inflation still is"
"19647390","19649330"," making up most of that increase."
"19650050","19653250"," Those are things that are going to shrink the budget that consumers have for anything else. "
"19653450","19656490"," Nikki, you work with the retail industry, all different types."
"19657030","19661270"," A lot of it is about technology, innovation, that's your background and you've covered this for a"
"19661270","19661750"," long time."
"19661750","19666130"," I am curious of what you're hearing from your retail clients right now when it comes to the"
"19666130","19669370"," environment hiring consumer trends. "
"19670110","19675970"," Yeah, labor costs are still really high and there's been no give back in that regard for frontline"
"19675970","19678170"," workers in any place."
"19678490","19686970"," So whether the labor market is soft or whether it's continuing to chug along, the effective hourly"
"19686970","19689510"," rate that a lot of retailers are paying to staff."
"19689510","19698690"," I mean, I see advertisements and windows in the Denver area for $15, $17, $20 an hour for a part"
"19698690","19700450"," time frontline retail job. "
"19700730","19704470"," So that part of it is definitely still impacting their business very much."
"19704470","19710270"," So I would say the other factor that historically was impacting inflation seems to be easing up,"
"19710270","19711570"," which is on the supply chain side."
"19711570","19715550"," So we're definitely seeing where supply chains have evened out. "
"19715750","19723010"," There might be some weird things like sriracha that come along and disrupt very specific things."
"19723210","19728810"," But overall, and in general, I would say that the supply chain issues and the shortages that really"
"19728810","19732470"," impact the price rises of 2021 and 2022."
"19732830","19735190"," Those definitely seem to be smoothed out. "
"19735690","19740350"," Just got about 45 seconds quickly, Nikki, are we going to see more of what we see in Zara where"
"19740350","19743810"," you dump stuff into a bin and it comes up on a monitor and we don't need workers and I'm"
"19743810","19745070"," taking off the security tag."
"19745130","19745870"," Uniqlo does it too."
"19746510","19749790"," Yeah, Uniqlo has definitely been a forerunner there. "
"19750410","19757130"," You know, both of those companies kind of went on their own to kind of drive that innovation and"
"19757130","19760510"," the rest of the technology industry hasn't completely caught up with that."
"19760510","19765970"," So I do think that we can get to that point, but I think there's going to be a delay."
"19766110","19768490"," They like custom built their own solutions to do that. "
"19768490","19769810"," Soon I'm going to be back in the stockroom."
"19770070","19773410"," Real quickly, Molly Smith just got about 15, 20 seconds."
"19773650","19774490"," What's your next focal point?"
"19774870","19775270"," Oh, goodness. "
"19775670","19777690"," I think we've got PPI tomorrow, right?"
"19778150","19778310"," Hopefully."
"19778810","19779690"," Is that really a focal point?"
"19780170","19782430"," I mean, look, it's another inflation point."
"19782630","19785530"," You know, it's another thing before September and then I guess Jackson Hole. "
"19786150","19787670"," But the US Open, obviously, we're more important."
"19787670","19788890"," Wait a minute."
"19789130","19789750"," Okay, good. "
"19789870","19791870"," Can't talk to Molly Smith and I'll talk about you."
"19791870","19793670"," I can tell you already, there's going to be crowds."
"19794130","19797150"," And if you want to look for a sign of consumer spending at the higher end, it's going to be"
"19797150","19797290"," there. "
"19797310","19798670"," The tickets are already sold out for some days."
"19798950","19800510"," What do you think the honey deuce is going for?"
"19800710","19801950"," Molly Smith, Nicki Bard."
"19802230","19802970"," Thank you so much. "
"19803670","19804070"," Oredactos."
"19804210","19804570"," This is Bloomberg."
"19806690","19809930"," Bloomberg radio on demand and in your podcast feed. "
"19810410","19814730"," On the latest edition of the tape podcast, a conversation with Mark Douglas, CEO of Mountain."
"19814730","19822070"," I think the fundamental issue is Disney, you know, sell has magical prices for everything they do,"
"19822110","19824750"," meaning the prices are generally pretty high."
"19825550","19831530"," And I think they're not really delivering magical, you know, experiences and our magical content"
"19831530","19832330"," right now. "
"19832630","19837830"," And they keep looking externally for whether the factors that are affecting the business rather"
"19837830","19839170"," than just looking internally."
"19839170","19844890"," And so even if consumers are spending less money, then deliver the magic and take a bigger share"
"19844890","19845230"," wallet."
"19845710","19848010"," What's the answer on the whole streaming thing?"
"19848130","19849690"," Does streamers really make money, Mark?"
"19849970","19855190"," Well, I mean, obviously Netflix is definitely making money and I think you're going to see it"
"19855190","19861870"," because Netflix, their ad supported tier is, you know, off to somewhat of a slow start, but it's"
"19861870","19863710"," just hugely profitable for them. "
"19863950","19868090"," What they're doing in password sharing again is just hugely profitable for them."
"19868090","19872910"," And my opinion is Netflix is going to kind of enter a new era of just increased earnings."
"19873310","19878670"," And I think anyone else can get there, but it starts with, you know, people want to be in the"
"19878670","19884630"," parks, people want to watch Star Wars, they want to watch new Disney movies, and they want to do"
"19884630","19886590"," them at the same rates that they have in the past. "
"19886870","19888590"," So I think Disney can absolutely get there."
"19888690","19893190"," I'm a little concerned that, you know, they're talking about reducing their investment in streaming"
"19893190","19897770"," or moving away from ESPN as if people don't want to watch sports anymore."
"19897770","19904410"," It's a little bit of just like everything seems to be in turmoil where, you know, I don't think the"
"19904410","19906030"," consumer has actually changed that much. "
"19906310","19910870"," It's Disney's the one that seems to not know exactly the direction they want to go."
"19928530","19930650"," Hmm, how many carbs are in this cheeseburger?"

"20135670","20138770"," We generally think that inflation is going to have a hard time hitting."
"20138990","20141610"," It's two percent target that the Fed has set. "

"20186690","20189470"," We're going to talk a little bit more about tapestry. "
"20189470","20191470"," As Charlie mentioned, you know who they are."
"20191670","20193410"," They own Coach, Kate Spade."
"20193810","20196150"," Used to be Coach, but rebranded a few years ago. "
"20196410","20198430"," I was going to say, I don't know if everyone knows who they are."
"20198590","20201910"," I think when this rebranding happened, Carol, I was like, I'm going to have such a hard time"

"20206830","20210610"," I feel like I'm going to age myself, although I was not, I was young, or it was my older"

"20214730","20216630"," That's all I can think of, of that album."
"20219190","20221070"," Anyway, yes, Capri Holdings though."
"20221350","20222730"," It was created by Michael Kors. "
"20223150","20224510"," It owns Versace."
"20225030","20226110"," It owns Jimmy Chew."
"20226250","20227610"," So definitely is kind of your higher end. "
"20227870","20230670"," Eight and a half billion dollar deal as Charlie laid out."
"20230970","20233850"," And so we are seeing some movement when it comes to luxury goods."

"20238190","20243790"," Although, forgive me, coaching Kate Spade, not inexpensive, but I don't know if I put that in the"

"20246830","20247190"," Ooh."
"20247390","20251070"," Well, I'm glad you brought them up because that is the context here, right?"
"20251190","20252570"," Taken on the European rivals. "
"20252890","20255550"," And we got a great group to really talk us through it."
"20255790","20259850"," Bloomberg News, US Luxury Retail and Personal Care Industries reporter, Janet Newman joins us on"
"20259850","20260870"," the phone from New York City."
"20261250","20265910"," And our Bloomberg Intelligence team, Deborah Aitkin, senior analyst who covers global luxury goods,"
"20266290","20267630"," home, beauty and personal care. "
"20267750","20269530"," She joins us on the phone from London."
"20270050","20271990"," Hey, Janette, I just want to start with you."
"20272150","20276110"," Give us the context here, some of the deal terms, but also the context that you and the team wrote"
"20276110","20277550"," about on the consumer team earlier today. "
"20278350","20278790"," Yeah."
"20278950","20279530"," Thank you so much."
"20279550","20281590"," And I also love the tapestry album as well. "
"20281730","20285450"," I will just, I will join you on that."
"20285950","20294210"," I mean, I think some of the context here is just that, you know, coach went into the pandemic much"
"20294210","20299150"," stronger than Michael Kors and has come out of the pandemic much stronger than Michael Kors."
"20299610","20304610"," And we're seeing that, you know, in the sense that now, um, uh, coach's parent company is taking,"
"20304610","20306010"," is taking over Michael Kors. "
"20306350","20310070"," And I think some of the reasons for that, I mean, you know, keep in mind, going back a decade,"
"20310070","20312250"," these companies used to be kind of head to head competitors."
"20312870","20315790"," And, and coach has really pulled ahead of Michael Kors."
"20316010","20318790"," It's been able to raise prices, raise its brand, brand cache. "
"20319470","20323230"," It's done that through, um, you know, some clever, some clever designs."
"20323770","20324850"," It's renovated its stores."
"20325330","20327410"," Whereas Michael Kors has struggled a bit more. "
"20327670","20333410"," Um, it's still very present in some kind of lower end, um, department stores as you both mentioned,"
"20333570","20336990"," I mean, Michael Kors is, is, is, is more a mass market."
"20337130","20341890"," Coach is not, you know, it's a level of competing with some of the LVMHs of the world, but it's"
"20341890","20346090"," definitely been, been able to charge more, um, more for its handbags."
"20346270","20350410"," And both of these companies, you know, together now, I mean, they will have completely, they'll"
"20350410","20354230"," completely dominate, um, the US handbag market here in the US. "
"20354570","20355950"," Well, Deborah, we want to bring you into this."
"20355950","20359910"," As we mentioned, senior analyst who covers global luxury goods, home, beauty and personal care for"
"20359910","20361090"," our Bloomberg intelligence team."
"20361090","20362650"," She's on the phone in London. "
"20362850","20365970"," Deborah, um, how do you see this deal?"
"20366290","20368230"," And is it about the Michael Kors brand?"
"20368490","20369450"," Is it about Jimmy too?"
"20369810","20370530"," Is it about Versace?"
"20370750","20371530"," Is it all of it?"
"20371610","20373150"," Like, how are you thinking about this?"
"20375110","20375530"," Hi."
"20375690","20376910"," So they all have their place."
"20377370","20384250"," Uh, but when we think about Michael Kors, 70% of the business, um, you know, the purchase price"
"20384250","20388290"," there, it's about, um, really reinventing the Michael Kors back. "
"20388290","20398290"," I see that the US will be the big market in the fixed marketing, uh, digital in"
"20398290","20398650"," wholesale."
"20399630","20403950"," Um, and but also, you know, there's, there's much more to do elsewhere."
"20404570","20408690"," And, um, I just feel like Michael Kors is off this way. "
"20408890","20411950"," It really, uh, reinvented itself a few years ago."
"20412110","20416250"," And then I felt it became too saturated in the marketplace and there's more to do."
"20416250","20423810"," And I feel like the data composition and the way that digital works and the way that, um, if we"
"20423810","20429530"," think about the way that top street works, that they depend less on wholesale accounts, which is"
"20429530","20433950"," really felt the pain in the US in the last few months, then that could be beneficial. "
"20434870","20440650"," The other side of it for me is that there's a lot to do with Versace and Jimmy too."
"20440870","20441610"," They're not sizable."
"20442390","20445210"," There was always a comment back before she could double. "
"20445830","20447970"," Um, and that should be doing more in Europe too."
"20448310","20454790"," And it gives us, it gives us footprints for tapestry into that luxury market, which is so much more"
"20454790","20456630"," profitable and much faster growth."
"20457030","20459410"," Did I, I want to bring you in back, I'll bring you back in. "
"20459650","20461790"," Uh, I'm looking at tapestry down about 16%."
"20462370","20463550"," It's been, it's out."
"20463650","20465130"," It's pretty much, it's lows of the day. "
"20465810","20470310"," Uh, and Capri, no surprise as being the target here is just."
"20470670","20472050"," And at a quite premium, right?"
"20472250","20473350"," At quite a premium, right?"
"20473470","20474110"," In terms of this deal."
"20474270","20475510"," I mean, it's up 55%. "
"20475510","20479430"," I'm looking at, it's an eight and a half billion dollar deal and we're looking at a market cap of"
"20479430","20480230"," 6.3 billion."
"20480550","20485030"," So, you know, it's just kind of interesting in terms of some of the financials."
"20486050","20490730"," Tapestry shares, not surprising for it to be down as the acquirer, but it seems like a lot. "
"20490950","20492490"," Is that investor saying you paid too much?"
"20493550","20502270"," I think part of it is, is investors questioning, um, how easy it will be for tapestry to turn"
"20502270","20507150"," around the Michael Coors brand, which has some of the, you know, the problems that Deborah, that"
"20507150","20508090"," Deborah laid out, right?"
"20508210","20513750"," I mean, tapestry is essentially coach coaches, the majority of its revenue and Michael, and Capri"
"20513750","20514970"," is essentially Michael Coors."
"20515130","20519050"," That's the, that's the bulk of its, of its revenue, something around like 70%."
"20519050","20521390"," And as Deborah said, it's been a brand that's been struggling. "
"20521750","20526970"," And so to make this deal really work, tapestry has to turn around Michael Coors."
"20526970","20531910"," And, you know, people would say, okay, well, the executive, the tapestry, they've been able to turn"
"20531910","20535770"," around the coach brand, you know, think about the coach brand a decade ago and think of where it is"
"20535770","20536030"," now."
"20536350","20537530"," It's really elevated it. "
"20538070","20541270"," Um, but the question is still there, you know, whether they'll be able to turn around the Michael"
"20541270","20544130"," Coors brand and keep in mind, you know, they turned around coach."
"20544950","20549790"," Um, they did an okay job turning around, uh, Capes Bay, about that's still a work in progress."
"20550230","20552630"," They did not turn around Stuart Weisman and their other brands. "
"20553030","20554570"," That's kind of, that's kind of in the dumps."
"20554570","20557430"," And, and now they're taking on three more brands."
"20557750","20559390"," So the question is still there. "
"20559630","20564150"," If they'll be able to kind of take, take the successful coach playbook and apply it to Michael"
"20564150","20564610"," Coors."
"20564850","20568930"," Well, they've obviously are juggling a lot of other, a lot of other new companies that they've"
"20568930","20569110"," acquired."
"20569470","20571170"," Jeanette, any regulatory risk here?"
"20572790","20576990"," I think that's, that's a question that's been, that's been raised and will, you know, obviously"
"20576990","20578830"," we'll have to, we'll have to see. "
"20578830","20584650"," Um, I mean, this, this, some of the data that we, that we have from, um, global data and analysts"
"20584650","20585310"," at global data."
"20585730","20589790"," Uh, you know, these two companies combined will be the fourth largest luxury company in the world."
"20589970","20595150"," For the market share of around 5.1% in the Americas, they'll be the second largest player behind"
"20595150","20595770"," LVMH. "
"20596410","20600750"," Um, so that those, those numbers make people think that's not as, as much of a concern, but that is"
"20600750","20602390"," still a, um, to be sure."
"20602390","20608190"," Deborah, as an analyst who's covering, uh, the sector and I do wonder how much time do you think,"
"20608190","20614510"," you know, investors need to give tapestry to be able to kind of figure out how they turn around the"
"20614510","20615230"," Coors brand."
"20615830","20620630"," Um, knowing maybe some of the problems, I have to say, I feel like I see Coors everywhere and I"
"20620630","20621490"," feel like it's a little saturated. "
"20621490","20622790"," Maybe that's part of the problem."
"20623110","20623230"," Yeah."
"20625290","20628650"," Um, I would say this is a two to three year fix. "
"20628650","20632170"," I mean, it doesn't, it's not fair to complete until calendar 24."
"20632930","20639030"," So we probably see by maybe end of first quarter 24 that the steel complete through."
"20639810","20645550"," And from there, we wait, uh, two years for 200 million of synergies to move through. "
"20646310","20651610"," Um, we end up, I think with a, uh, maybe any, and just to do the Darm margin on the"
"20651610","20657990"," back of that, that's probably 150 basis points and get to mid teams operating margin."
"20657990","20662010"," But first is some of those peers that still isn't enough."
"20662610","20669030"," Um, so for me, I think it's a two to three year process and I feel like standalone could pre"
"20669030","20670230"," give them where the debt was. "
"20671130","20673470"," Uh, and how it needed to turn everything."
"20674110","20681330"," But it maybe is better within this portfolio because of the wholesale adaptation of the model"
"20681330","20686830"," because of the data capture because of working more closely with digital is the big difference"
"20686830","20687630"," between these."
"20687630","20691650"," Um, but the other side of it is I actually feel that it. "
"20692290","20695170"," In the price that this was going to happen."
"20695170","20697430"," And when we say no stocks are very much today."
"20697970","20702050"," I failed back over a year and we're looking at a mix of buying hold. "
"20702990","20709170"," Um, on our function, looking at, um, potential price target."
"20709630","20710630"," Mm hmm."
"20711450","20715530"," About above and add when we're looking at recommendation. "
"20716270","20716430"," Right."
"20716650","20723150"," Um, but that place target was $70 and I know that is now over 60% of the market was"
"20723150","20725610"," into the North and right, which is cool down."
"20725930","20726370"," Got it. "
"20726370","20727030"," It's not fair."
"20727730","20728850"," It's meant to the biggest."
"20729350","20729650"," Yep. "
"20730230","20732470"," We gotta run and we've, we apologize, Deborah."

"21394390","21395250"," Tim always reminds me."
"21395530","21398330"," Got to take a longer view step out a little bit in the perspective. "
"21398330","21403070"," We've had quite a run certainly when it comes to some of those big tech names in the Nasdaq overall"
"21403070","21404090"," and also the S&P."
"21404390","21407750"," So a little bit of churn maybe is to be expected."
"21409290","21409690"," Absolutely. "
"21409890","21411110"," Thanks for having me back, Tim Carol."
"21412130","21417790"," We've gone a long way year to date and what a change from 2022 for sure."
"21418130","21422150"," But if you look at just this earnings season, we're still sort of wading through, but we're more on"
"21422150","21423050"," the tail end of it. "
"21423050","21430130"," I think the reality is that many companies, or the most of the companies, have beaten expectations."
"21431490","21435890"," But when you look at year over year earnings growth, not much has changed."
"21436610","21442990"," And so those expectations have been exceeded, which is something that we all welcome. "
"21443590","21448230"," But markets haven't reacted dramatically as a whole to the earnings cycle."
"21448230","21454710"," And I think the market is trying to figure out whether or not a PE multiple for the S&P"
"21454710","21463030"," 500 at 20 times anticipated 2023 full year earnings is the right multiple given the current"
"21463030","21463650"," environment."
"21463870","21464730"," Do you think it's the right multiple?"
"21466050","21467270"," Well, it's interesting. "
"21467650","21470810"," I think the bond market is signaling two different responses to that."
"21470910","21474710"," And I always sort of peer into the bond market to try to help me answer that question."
"21475430","21481130"," The inversion of the yield curve suggests that a recession is in fact around the corner, whether"
"21481130","21484770"," it's the back half of this year, or perhaps the front half of next year. "
"21485730","21492010"," But nominal rates are actually higher on a year to date basis, which is sort of a little bit of"
"21492010","21496610"," a conundrum for those who are trying to extract tea leaves from what the bond market is telling us"
"21496610","21497110"," right now."
"21497550","21503750"," We think, you know, when you look at the trajectory of inflation, we saw CPI this morning and, you"
"21503750","21508350"," know, a year and one month ago, we're at 9% headline and now we're at 3.2%. So we've"
"21508350","21509230"," come a long way."
"21509930","21514030"," And the Fed, if you look at Fed Fund's futures, looks like it's, it's on hold. "
"21514570","21517570"," I think there's only like a 10% chance of a move in September."
"21517570","21523750"," And so, you know, it's just sort of interesting, particularly with the significant, I think the"
"21523750","21527410"," most significant short interest in the treasury market that we've seen in my lifetime."
"21528910","21533470"," Where we are right now, where the bond market sort of signaling that maybe we're not all clear on"
"21533470","21536110"," inflation, maybe growth remained stronger than expected. "
"21537150","21541870"," And the equity market is, is, is, is a little more a sanguine on that point."
"21541870","21550670"," So P E multiple, how reliable, how much do you use it as kind of an indicator, a reliable indicator"
"21550670","21551690"," of where we go from here?"
"21553230","21560310"," It's, it's not a first of all, you have to look at which components of the equity market we're"
"21560310","21566150"," looking at when we talk about P E multiples because it's where we come from in P E's where we"
"21566150","21566870"," may be going."
"21566870","21570670"," What's the historical basis for P E's?"
"21570910","21575150"," If you think we're going into a deep recession, P E multiples for the S and P 500 tend to"
"21575150","21576970"," bottom at 14 times, 15 times. "
"21577250","21579350"," So, you know, that, that's, that's an anchoring point."
"21579430","21583030"," If you believe in hard landing, market's certainly not pricing that in."
"21583470","21585970"," You also have to think about P multiples within sectors. "
"21586030","21592130"," You know, you look at Europe, you look at, you know, heavily industrial banking focused part of the"
"21592130","21592750"," equity market."
"21592750","21598250"," Well, naturally P E multiples because it's a lower growth segment of the market and the economy are"
"21598250","21599430"," going to be, are going to be lower."
"21599690","21605110"," So it's not healthy for one to sort of look through the S and P at 20 times in compared"
"21605110","21609090"," to the European market that has far less technology and therefore growth exposure. "
"21609510","21609910"," Okay."
"21610310","21614190"," So I ask you this question all the time, Aaron, someone comes to you with money."
"21614290","21615250"," How do you deploy it right now?"
"21616470","21622650"," Well, you know, oftentimes people come to us with, with, with capital that's invested, you know,"
"21622670","21624430"," we're very cognizant of tax implications. "
"21625290","21632770"," I would just say this, based on where we think inflation is moving, we are incrementally more"
"21632770","21636550"," bullish on taking a bit more duration risk in fixed income here."
"21636550","21640890"," In other words, extending out into fixed income, owning high grade fixed income."
"21641150","21647070"," That means to us, treasuries, mortgage backsecurities, and maybe even some investment grade credit"
"21647070","21647530"," exposure. "
"21648050","21650730"," On the equity side, we still believe in diversification."
"21650990","21652930"," We think there are opportunities across multiple sectors."
"21653450","21656250"," We're just not given the current valuation in the market. "
"21656570","21663010"," We're not poised to sort of increase our targets here, but we do believe in equities for the long"
"21663010","21663450"," haul."
"21663450","21667750"," And that's, that's a philosophy that we've always embraced here at Clear Harbor."
"21667990","21670790"," Hey, on the treasuries are the fixed income side. "
"21672230","21673330"," What kind of duration?"
"21673590","21674990"," You said you're willing to go out a little bit."
"21675070","21675710"," How far out?"
"21676010","21676230"," Yeah."
"21676810","21680690"," Well, if you look at the Bloomberg aggregate bond index, which is the primary benchmark of the"
"21680690","21685010"," fixed income market, it has an average weighted maturity of about eight and a half years, maybe a"
"21685010","21685950"," little more than that. "
"21685950","21692190"," And of course, you know, it seems like Mr. Market in fixed income is hugging the front end of the"
"21692190","21697530"," market right now because treasury bills are well over 5% in the yield to maturity of the Bloomberg"
"21697530","21704210"," aggregate is only about 4.9%. But if you think the Fed is sort of done or about done, we"
"21704210","21709070"," think this is a good time to at least nudge your average maturity and duration further out the"
"21709070","21709250"," curve."
"21709250","21715070"," So it depends on the client, depends on, you know, what the objectives are, but just moving, moving"
"21715070","21715490"," it out."
"21715730","21720270"," If your average maturity is now one years, you know, maybe you can move it out to two or three. "
"21720710","21724370"," If you can't move it out to eight and a half and you're at two now, maybe you move it"
"21724370","21729390"," out to four or five, you know, so, you know, it's, it's making those sort of incremental shifts"
"21729390","21733350"," right now, given the sort of risk reward that we see in the market."
"21734450","21738830"," Right, which maybe explains to where I think was at the 30 year today, the treasury option didn't"

"22138050","22139010"," stay home Friday."
"22139250","22143510"," So hybrid schedules have rendered Friday happy hours obsolete, leading restaurants and bars to"
"22143510","22145250"," adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. "
"22145870","22147590"," So hello Wednesday and Thursday."
"22147930","22150230"," I was out for dinner before a movie last night."

"22158710","22161810"," But you kind of don't fit into this because you're not a remote worker. "
"22162890","22165630"," You probably were around a lot of remote workers."
"22166210","22168870"," I bet Thursday's are pretty big because a lot of people don't work on Fridays."
"22169170","22173130"," So rise and roll work has made the ritual of the Friday happy hour a tough sell in financial"
"22173130","22177330"," districts from New York to London, forcing bars and restaurants to rethink their strategies for"
"22177330","22178810"," courting the cubicle crowd. "
"22179330","22179750"," I like that."
"22180130","22184590"," The physical of Fridays as owners and managers doing everything from hiring midweek DJs to changing"
"22184590","22187870"," their drink specials to staffing up behind the bar for shifts that are earlier."
"22187870","22191810"," In the week, you know, a lot of places have happy hours that are like, you know, weekdays, right?"
"22192410","22194950"," Because they have trouble getting people into the bars. "
"22195470","22199590"," It's just like the habits have completely shifted in recent years."
"22199770","22203390"," It's similar to the conversation that you and I had a lot during the pandemic, which was the"
"22203390","22205430"," commerce centers of places have shifted."
"22205650","22206450"," It's no longer Midtown. "
"22206730","22211050"," It's the different neighborhoods around New York City where people live and are going to lunch in"
"22211050","22215810"," places in Brooklyn that they would only frequent on a weekend if they weren't working from home."
"22215810","22216770"," Yeah, exactly."
"22217450","22218390"," I mean, it's really interesting. "
"22218390","22220290"," Some of the changes that they are doing, right?"
"22220470","22225210"," Like you said, DJs at different days or different hours and people are just adjusting."
"22225810","22231870"," So I think about it too, you know, going to, you know, a local shoemaker like here like during the"
"22231870","22234830"," pandemic, people weren't coming in and even after it with all the remote working."
"22235050","22235910"," Like, they got hit hard. "
"22236190","22236790"," It's really hard."
"22237110","22237510"," All right."
"22237590","22240790"," Anyway, adjust your happy hours folks because it's five o'clock somewhere. "
"22241110","22242230"," Or it's four o'clock somewhere."

"22287650","22290470"," Welcome to our audiences across all of our Bloomberg platforms. "
"22290670","22292150"," Carol, you look vexed."
"22292170","22292670"," What are you looking at?"
"22292790","22293190"," I don't know."
"22293410","22295290"," I'm just kind of looking for something to talk about because. "
"22296890","22298650"," I appreciate the honesty, Carol."
"22298830","22299230"," I like that."
"22300230","22301410"," It's like once again, right?"
"22301630","22302430"," We have these day rooms. "
"22302450","22304130"," These two-day work weeks are tough, right?"
"22304530","22306090"," So we'll stop getting back in the group."
"22306610","22309350"," No, but I think it's just an interesting trade where we did see a rally."
"22309630","22310810"," We really kind of fizzled. "
"22311430","22314450"," You do see rates kind of holding on to some of their highs in the session."
"22314610","22318050"," I just think, you know, we've got to just kind of wait to see what we get in terms of"
"22318050","22321070"," the Fed's next move and direction and kind of guidance if you will."
"22321090","22321770"," And that's a long way. "
"22321870","22322710"," What a month away or so?"
"22322930","22324970"," It isn't a lot can happen between now and a month."
"22325250","22328170"," We have, you know, another employment report that we hear about."
"22328170","22332670"," We have more inflation reports, but I'm still obsessed with today's trade and the way that the S&P"
"22332670","22335270"," 500 is up as much as 1.3% earlier in the session. "
"22335490","22338610"," The NASDAQ was up more than 1.6 earlier in the session."
"22338950","22342110"," And we're looking at a day that's going to close pretty much, you know, fractionally higher,"
"22342210","22344410"," perhaps, or even lower if it moves lower in the next few minutes."
"22344750","22348290"," I like what our last guest just said, which is that people that she talks to her clients. "
"22348550","22350450"," No one's obsessed with recession anymore."
"22350630","22355810"," I mean, Romaine, you, Carol and I are, but their clients are no longer obsessed with that."
"22355810","22360150"," It's more about looking ahead and making sure that they, you know, catch up to the gains that they"
"22360150","22361030"," might have missed out on. "
"22361390","22365310"," Yeah, I mean, you know, look, you get to a point, too, where we should point out that there are"
"22365310","22370970"," some seasonality effects going on right now, particularly when it comes to volume in the middle of"
"22370970","22373230"," August, where a lot of folks, of course, are away from the desk."
"22373430","22374450"," And you don't have as many cows."
"22374770","22376170"," I mean, earning season is wrapping up. "
"22376370","22380510"," And as we pointed out, it's still ways away until we get that next decision."
"22381010","22384010"," So you hang your head on to the economic data that you got this morning."
"22384530","22386290"," There's certainly some positives in there. "
"22386470","22387890"," And maybe that was a catalyst for the rally. "
