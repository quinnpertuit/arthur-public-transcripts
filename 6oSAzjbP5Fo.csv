"39380","44280"," Hey, uh, yee-haw."
"45840","54260"," Let's save that bad boy there."
"55820","56640"," Where, where?"
"60220","60720"," Save. "
"60720","66280"," Hey, everybody's like, what the fuck is going on?"
"66340","67300"," There's nothing going on here."
"67400","68280"," It's ping-pong all day."
"68940","69620"," What it is. "
"73610","74050"," What's up?"
"75710","76730"," Scared into it here."
"78810","83330"," Well, it says it's on, okay."
"88680","90900"," What's going on, fuck there?"
"92500","93840"," I got a few things I got in here. "
"93940","94920"," I got some weirdness going on."
"94920","96720"," Again, another day."
"96760","101160"," I forgot to put my, uh, thumbnail up, so I got to put a thumbnail on there. "
"102600","103880"," Dude, that's not my thumbnail."
"106760","108260"," What is going on here?"
"109460","110100"," Hold on."
"110440","114420"," It's good morning to all of you. "
"114700","115980"," Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving."
"117380","118640"," Get right into it here."
"123460","133320"," If you're in a trade, you're likely going to get paid"
"133320","134460"," on either side. "
"135000","137580"," A couple things here."
"138040","142580"," Friday we ended up hitting the market to that gamma bar."
"142840","143700"," They wouldn't let us go up. "
"143880","144900"," There wasn't enough volume."
"145320","145700"," Blah, blah, blah."
"146380","148880"," We expected us to go up a little bit. "
"149540","152680"," Like one part of Friday to go up just a hair."
"156590","159250"," I expected a high and a low, but a pin on Friday."
"159450","160430"," Low volume day. "
"161290","164370"," I figured there would at least be some puts burning off of it."
"164470","165650"," I figured everybody was going to be lit up in puts."
"166590","169410"," And then they either get offset, um, leave to get offset. "
"170510","173670"," Like you throw some puts in for this week and then throw some zero day puts."
"174210","177510"," Uh, to get the ball rolling on Friday."
"177510","178390"," That didn't happen. "
"178710","181430"," We just burned off pinned on Friday."
"181430","185850"," Now this morning, you can kind of see what is good."
"185930","186530"," Hold on a second here. "
"198000","199080"," Give me one quick second here."
"202420","203600"," Yeah, I guess fuck it."
"203600","205320"," I'll just leave it for now. "
"205380","205760"," Just leave it."
"206040","206840"," We'll talk about it though."
"206960","208020"," So basically this. "
"208200","208320"," Okay."
"208800","210440"," Coming into Monday today, right?"
"210800","211840"," First of all, good morning."
"212840","215040"," Um, why did I put this up?"
"218100","221480"," Uh, so basically we've got a really tight range today, right?"
"221480","221820"," All right. "
"221880","222720"," The options market."
"223660","229220"," This morning, like, let's think if we can take a look over here at a spy really quick."
"233860","236340"," And, um, I think that I gotta do this. "
"236440","237520"," I gotta, I gotta download this."
"237600","239180"," I don't know why this is not downloading."
"240860","241620"," Download this. "
"242080","242600"," Come on now."
"243380","244860"," But no, I don't want an MP for."
"245160","246980"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"246980","247440"," No, no, no."
"248260","249940"," Why do I have an MP for in this?"
"251080","253280"," No, I don't want to suggest it MP for."
"253280","255060"," I don't want a PNG. "
"255660","256519"," Download that."
"257760","258279"," Okay."
"258720","260720"," So let me just one quick second here. "
"260720","261280"," I gotta do this."
"262020","263220"," I don't know what's going on."
"263360","268000"," I'm like, I don't know what's, I got an MP for something going on in the background that I don't"
"268000","268480"," know about. "
"269240","270160"," Save that."
"271240","273540"," Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr."
"274200","276660"," Sort by newest chat customization. "
"278180","278700"," Members."
"280020","280540"," Save."
"281260","281680"," Okay. "
"281680","281740"," Okay."
"282140","291780"," So I want to show you this because a lot of I want to show this."
"291840","297770"," I want to show this because there really isn't a lot to do. "
"297850","299030"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"299290","300150"," There's a couple of things here."
"300190","305350"," If you're a bear, if you're a bear, right?"
"307750","309790"," The market is supportive right now. "
"309790","314910"," So your pullbacks, unless you start getting under a certain number."
"315090","318130"," I think it's for 52ish."
"319910","322470"," It's going to be hard if you're a seller here. "
"325950","327190"," And hold on here."
"327310","327870"," Put that on."
"328270","329970"," First of all, I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. "
"330850","331670"," I'll tell you all that."
"332330","334790"," We're going to switch over right now to the Webull screen."
"335910","337550"," And I want to show you something here. "
"337550","340650"," So you see these sellers up here."
"341830","342650"," This is on Friday."
"342650","343690"," They came in hard and heavy. "
"343870","344610"," Came in hard and heavy."
"344750","345470"," Came in hard and heavy."
"347030","347890"," And we're in this. "
"348070","349430"," We're in this like pin range here."
"349530","351170"," I'll show you this here in SBX in just a minute."
"351290","353450"," But same thing on the opening bell this morning. "
"353450","355510"," Came in to the same bullshit again here."
"357050","358750"," Now I want to tell you something here."
"359130","360690"," This is what you want to pay attention to. "
"360790","363830"," This is like super tight, coily shit."
"363890","364150"," Okay."
"365730","368850"," And you know, like you're going to expect a trend day here today. "
"368870","369690"," Probably not."
"369810","371370"," Are you going to expect a big blast down today?"
"371370","371990"," Probably not."
"372530","376350"," You might on the downside get 452 if you're lucky. "
"377650","384930"," And we have what we need to do is allow these market participants to come back from their"
"384930","385330"," vacations."
"385990","388470"," You know, the Senate is on vacation until Wednesday."
"389330","392610"," Now you might be a poor pleb out there that feel great. "
"392610","394390"," Like I took Wednesday through Sunday."
"394730","396630"," Well, that's not what Wall Street does."
"396850","397370"," That's not what. "
"397950","400210"," Well, I guess some of the plebs on Wall Street do that."
"400310","401550"," But that's not what the big boys do, right?"
"401650","402610"," They take an extra couple days."
"403230","408050"," They get that extra day or two to come back home and go back to work and. "
"408990","413170"," You know, they got to kiss their their mistresses and all that stuff and see them off."
"413290","415770"," Get them all paid and that kind of stuff."
"415890","419470"," So the market is reopened, but it really isn't. "
"419610","421270"," I mean, it really won't be till Wednesday."
"422030","424110"," So this doesn't surprise me."
"425010","428430"," And seeing this range today doesn't surprise me. "
"428910","430370"," I posted on Twitter this morning."
"431570","436470"," I posted on just if you want to know them in calls right now, seven puts calls, puts calls."
"437410","438170"," And I'm making money. "
"438530","442050"," I'm shaving off like a hundred bucks each every time, like up, down, up, down, up, down."
"442670","447170"," So whatever that is, but we don't have a break yet to the upside."
"447470","448690"," We don't have a break to the downside. "
"449750","454930"," We're not going to show you SPX really quick to give you guys an idea of where we are."
"455170","458290"," So we really like SPX and this is the."
"460010","460910"," This is the. "
"462170","463450"," Let's see if they can show this for you."
"464730","468210"," What you really want to be looking at here is something important, right?"
"470230","474250"," So this is the call wall up here, 4600, right?"
"475070","476630"," This is resistance right here."
"477470","480390"," This yellow bar, but that's not the call wall. "
"480450","485350"," The call wall is up here and in the put wall is right here."
"485650","487070"," I mean, look at where the put wall is."
"487590","490070"," Put wall is right fucking here. "
"490230","491490"," So what does this tell me?"
"491930","496150"," It tells me that we need some puts and calls to come into the market or some real money buying"
"496150","498530"," or selling to make this market move."
"499550","505150"," And until we get that, I would expect range bound and even our pivots today."
"505870","511549"," Show this the range of the pivots today means we have no range expansion in the marketplace. "
"511750","516190"," There's probably a bunch of data gang out there that are giggling and laughing about this, but you"
"516190","522890"," probably need direction to be clarified as the week opens up."
"523049","525890"," I don't know that it's today is my point to you."
"525950","529730"," I don't know that today is your day for like big, big huge trend days and let's just start seeing. "
"529730","532510"," And this morning we saw a bunch of zero dates come in."
"533750","537930"," I saw 130,000 puts come in and stuff like that."
"538130","541830"," But you know, dealers in the morning are going to offset that trade. "
"541950","551150"," So as those come out initially, so you really want to see like sentiment change, real money"
"551150","554330"," selling, that kind of stuff for any kind of meaningful downside."
"554330","559430"," So even on a downside, even like the downside, if there was a role here, you really want to get"
"559430","567530"," underneath this put wall and get some range expansion with put buying much lower for the market to"
"567530","568110"," go down."
"568770","571030"," So until that happens until we see that. "
"571350","575450"," And even if you see it happening right now, you're going to see dealers offset that trade and"
"575450","581470"," probably keep squeezing us higher, squeezing us higher until until they've become dealt with"
"581470","582190"," neutral with that trade."
"582190","584950"," So do I think we go down this week?"
"585150","585450"," Sure."
"585810","587330"," Do I think we can consolidate this week?"
"587470","587690"," Sure. "
"588250","594970"," But this morning is not really, I'm assuming that a whole bunch of you are like stretched out,"
"595210","600070"," ready to go and it's not really happening on this opening bell."
"601610","604090"," And even in the upside moves, I'm not going to."
"604190","608750"," So this same thing applies to the downside applies to the upside. "
"610430","613290"," Not really expecting crazy town."
"613670","615210"," So we'll see."
"616010","616630"," I'm making money. "
"616810","617930"," I'm making money right now."
"618030","618530"," So hold on here."
"621320","623080"," We'll see what all this means, right?"
"623360","627500"," So even even this, if you look down below here in this lower chart down here. "
"627500","629620"," I mean, what am I expecting here?"
"629800","632580"," Look at these sellers right here, sellers, sellers."
"633360","635160"," And there's a couple funky things here."
"635460","636700"," I need you to understand this. "
"636940","637000"," Okay."
"637200","639660"," Especially if you have access to the jewelry, you have to understand this."
"640140","646720"," Even if you have the potential for huge squeezes here, but you still need price to come back down"
"646720","651320"," and confirm on the hourly trigger that we're going to go up. "
"651560","651740"," Okay."
"652520","654000"," It's a key point to this."
"654200","658040"," We can squeeze all day long in the early trigger, but that shit's coming back and you have to"
"658040","659400"," confirm that move higher. "
"659760","664460"," So normally, or most of the time, 70% of the time, you need to confirm that move higher."
"666020","668320"," My calls are fucking bouncing right now."
"670200","671520"," I need to just hold on. "
"671620","672120"," I just need to put it."
"672200","674740"," I need to put a salary and hold on a second here."
"676240","679400"," I'm going to get torn to pieces if I don't sell this stuff as it happens. "
"681180","687360"," Let me go over here and we got a lot of stuff coming out this week."
"687520","690620"," We've got some, but we got to actually have, do you guys know we got a lot of volatility coming"
"690620","691160"," out this week?"
"691860","693340"," We got to talk about here today."
"696140","699680"," So we'll talk about end of the year where we think we can get into the year. "
"699680","700660"," The VIX."
"702220","703040"," Look at that."
"703220","705140"," I was even gaining insight there as well. "
"705940","710460"," And what the end of the year is going to lay out for us."
"712060","714800"," You know, this looks bearish to me."
"715260","716360"," I'm watching the hourly. "
"716900","717780"," I'm going to show you this here."
"720120","726020"," I'm watching the hourly trend heading lower, see it heading lower and lower and lower, right?"
"726020","727260"," Slowly, slowly."
"727360","729680"," It's not big down, but it's reversing to the downside. "
"730340","733660"," You can see sellers up here just trying to sell, sell, sell."
"734460","735480"," You know, they're not giving this up."
"735640","736620"," They're pretty aggressive here. "
"737200","739260"," And we're not, we're not trending up today."
"739260","745040"," So I think today is going to be one of those like inside days with not much range."
"745400","749160"," And we'll see range expansion later in the week. "
"750320","752500"," So just up here, we'll keep our eyes on this."
"752740","755580"," This little yellow line that I have up here."
"756240","759180"," I just know these sellers are up here getting pissy and stinky. "
"763060","766700"," We'll chat about where I think the market's going the rest of the week, that kind of stuff."
"766980","772460"," And into the end of the year into, well, we'll see if we can take a look at the, see"
"772460","775860"," if we can look at the collar for the quarter as well for Friday."
"777300","778280"," Yeah, good to hear you guys. "
"778460","778660"," I'm back."
"779300","779840"," Kind of great."
"780020","780260"," Thanks again. "
"780360","780940"," We'll talk about Thanksgiving."
"781020","784080"," Ask you guys what you did on Thanksgiving, that kind of stuff."
"785300","786420"," Expectations for today. "
"787280","790180"," I think the, I think we'll see that range expansion later in the week."
"790220","797320"," I'm hoping that, you know, on Wednesday, we start to see the options market kind of fill out for"
"797320","799100"," expectations into end of the year."
"800000","803220"," VIX, you know, got went down, I think 1250 this morning. "
"803560","806460"," And there's a huge gamma bar down at 1150."
"806840","808520"," Talk to you guys about that last week."
"809000","810260"," So can we go to 1150?"
"810440","811260"," Fuck yeah, we can. "
"811760","814140"," And there's a bunch of people betting that we can go to that 1150 as well."
"814340","817080"," So that was interesting to see as well this morning."
"817820","818780"," I think we, hold on a second. "
"821060","827780"," We traded 1245 and 1245 for VIX this morning."
"828760","830300"," We'll talk about Dixie as well."
"830300","832620"," HYG is just ripping faces off. "
"833480","838040"," Uh, HYG actually rip faces off on, I believe, Wednesday and third, not Wednesday, Thursday of last,"
"838220","838900"," not Thursday, Wednesday."
"839120","839980"," I feel what day it was."
"840400","844020"," Early in the week was ripping and then pin was spy was pen, pen, pen. "
"845180","846760"," So I think I'll look at that as well."
"847400","850040"," We got to take a look at Tesla as well."
"850260","851620"," At some point, we'll talk Tesla. "
"851880","854260"," We got J-Pop coming out to talk this week too."
"855360","856480"," We got a bunch of Fed speakers."
"856880","859260"," We'll talk about all that stuff this morning. "
"859960","861100"," I'm going to give you a minute here."
"866050","871990"," What do I, I'm going to put a, I'm going to put a limit sell on these because a high"
"871990","877710"," side limit sell so that I'm not sitting here talking to you guys and I can't make money on this"
"877710","877930"," trade."
"878190","881110"," So this is my idea here for today is this shit. "
"882050","884110"," Ping pong, ping pong, ping pong."
"884490","889330"," So if you're looking for a trade today, it's like sell these tops by these bottoms."
"889970","891450"," Let me say I can show it to you again. "
"893850","895090"," Until we find a direction."
"895910","897450"," So even just this morning, okay."
"898990","901210"," You should be like buying this shit down here. "
"901290","902050"," I don't know why that's on."
"904110","908990"," Buying this shit down here selling this shit up here and just play the ping pong game until we"
"908990","910770"," decide if we're going up or we're going down."
"910770","914330"," Now currently I'm in calls right now. "
"914690","917410"," I should have sold that bar up there and I didn't."
"920580","921660"," So give me one quick second."
"921800","923600"," I'm going to put some, I'm going to put a stop in. "
"927670","928830"," What do I just let them ride?"
"944110","944650"," It will take that."
"944790","948230"," We'll see if I can get, see if I can catch a break on this squeeze right now."
"949510","951310"," See if I can make some money here. "
"954870","955590"," How are you all doing?"
"955790","956970"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"958130","959910"," Good morning to all of you that are out there."
"960590","966930"," It's one of these days where if you're bearish, take yourself a weak output."
"968230","968990"," Close your laptop. "
"969450","972950"," Don't watch the show and like get any bunker and just look for a low."
"973210","975050"," Play put a limit selling it or something like that."
"976230","981170"," If you start to get, you know that if we, as long as we're above, there's two things you guys"
"981170","982210"," know a bunch of the rules, right?"
"982210","987630"," As long as price is above the one minute trigger and one minute trigger is crossed above the five"
"987630","989010"," minute trigger, we're bullish. "
"989870","993130"," And if we're above the hourly trigger, we're super bullish, right?"
"993770","998790"," And you know that we're setting up right, even right now we're setting up some kind of a cluster,"
"998790","999210"," right?"
"999310","1000370"," It's either bullish or bearish."
"1001550","1003130"," We'll take a look at the trigger screen really quick."
"1004230","1007750"," And we'll take a 30 minute chart is what I prefer to watch. "
"1009270","1010530"," This 30 minute chart."
"1011330","1017310"," And we were down here at minus 17 earlier on velocity."
"1017770","1018610"," We're a little bit negative here. "
"1019150","1023569"," Expecting to be minus 25 at best for bearishness."
"1024210","1029290"," And then daily value is still bullish, still strong."
"1029690","1031230"," So I want you to see this here. "
"1032750","1034670"," Daily velocity is not peaked out yet."
"1034670","1037550"," So we haven't had any series of lows on daily velocity yet."
"1038030","1040270"," So not bearish there yet on daily velocity. "
"1041470","1044730"," So I can't tell you, yeah, we're going to start fucking rolling hard and heavy."
"1045210","1047170"," There's nothing saying that right now."
"1047910","1050210"," Velocity is still bullish on the day. "
"1051130","1056270"," And we're still working towards maxing out like plus 50 on daily velocity."
"1056770","1058590"," Got a little bit of weakness in the hourly velocity."
"1059650","1063310"," Minus 17, I think I was telling you earlier, we got done a minus 17 at one point. "
"1064070","1068430"," So, you know, we expect dips to be bought."
"1068590","1074530"," We expect support in this market until we start maxing out on daily velocity."
"1075310","1079550"," So just on that, on that cons or from that perspective. "
"1080590","1082790"," And let me say it simplifies again for you."
"1083630","1087210"," So if you're a bear, right?"
"1088450","1093570"," You, right now you see that this, this, uh, this gamibar is being bought, right?"
"1094070","1095110"," So we're buying this to go higher."
"1095370","1095890"," There's no reason. "
"1095990","1097570"," This is resistance, but not the top."
"1098030","1101970"," Uh, and even if you're bearish, you're going to expect this to get bought."
"1102870","1108570"," So you really need to be underneath this 45 30 45 30. "
"1108730","1109670"," If you're a bear, right?"
"1110310","1116570"," You need to get on, uh, your chart at home and just like make a bar at 45 30."
"1117970","1124790"," And if you are bearish, like really bearish, you want to go back and do some damage down below."
"1125370","1127550"," Like you want to take all that shit out down there. "
"1127590","1129550"," You know, that big giant gap shit that you've been looking at."
"1129930","1131730"," All that juiciness down here."
"1131730","1132510"," You want to roll that?"
"1132870","1134550"," You need, you need to get underneath that. "
"1134550","1134870"," Okay."
"1135670","1140830"," Until you do this, until you get underneath this, you ain't got no apple pie."
"1140870","1141250"," Okay. "
"1141870","1145470"," So if you're a bear and you're like, we'll want to go back down there and close that stuff."
"1145470","1146510"," You want to see that action."
"1147170","1148650"," You want to see not that action. "
"1148650","1156330"," You want to see this, this, and then the break of the new low, you get that."
"1157490","1161630"," And we're going to start going downtown and, you know, blasting through a bunch of shit."
"1162270","1163630"," Going all the way down to the daily trigger. "
"1163950","1167010"," Now, until that happens, uh, the market is supportive."
"1167010","1168370"," I need to understand that."
"1168850","1170370"," We are getting a little bit of role here. "
"1170490","1172770"," This is nice to see the flattening of the one in five minute."
"1173410","1174490"," That's always good to see."
"1175210","1177990"," Uh, but we still haven't had that, that, that break yet. "
"1178170","1179330"," And you need to see that break."
"1179350","1180330"," You want to see that cross."
"1180850","1182530"," This is a 15 minute trigger right now. "
"1182550","1183690"," Let's take a look at the one minute trigger."
"1184310","1187450"," And I mean, they're trying, but right now, man, it's not working, right?"
"1187610","1190490"," Right now price is staying above the one in the five of bull cross right here."
"1191770","1193930"," So, um, I don't know how to say it. "
"1196290","1197410"," Hold on a second here."
"1199570","1200770"," Hey, what's up Joey Donut?"
"1200910","1201570"," Good morning, baby."
"1202250","1203290"," I love you, man. "
"1203930","1204730"," How are you doing, brother?"
"1207880","1208440"," All right."

"1257100","1258220"," And they're like, you don't like COVID."

"1325060","1328060"," We got stuck with no driver this morning. "

"1357920","1358200"," I made them."
"1358300","1358560"," They sucked. "
"1359600","1361360"," I've had way better pancakes down south."

"1385600","1387900"," Nobody's eating the pancakes that I put all this work into."
"1389240","1394520"," And then I'm telling my youngest, my 10-year-old, I'm like, I'm like, take daddy's keys."
"1394820","1395840"," Go outside and lock the gate. "
"1396820","1399960"," Start my car to get it run into it so it's nice and warm and all that kind of stuff."

"1437640","1438960"," I forgot how to get to the school."
"1439380","1445860"," I had to put it on maps, Google maps for, find out where fucking school was."
"1447400","1448340"," What bad dad?"

"1488360","1490480"," So I got one of those, I got a bad uncle."
"1490880","1491540"," Nice guy though."
"1491640","1495220"," He's fucking awesome, but still like he's like, fuck you. "
"1495340","1495640"," I got money."
"1495740","1496440"," I do whatever I want."

"1506380","1506940"," What do I think?"
"1507000","1507660"," A spot a weekly."
"1508160","1509100"," I think we're going up. "
"1509220","1510480"," I think we're going to go up bigly."
"1510660","1514800"," But I think this week is a consolidation week to continue higher."
"1514800","1516960"," So that's what I think. "
"1517160","1521740"," So I think we're going to be range bound like tight ranges until we start to make a break to"
"1521740","1522020"," the upside."
"1522880","1524060"," I'm bullish if you want to know."
"1524520","1525980"," I like I should say this. "
"1525980","1533320"," I'm consultative bearish right now and bullish though in the over the month, over the week at the"
"1533320","1536000"," end of the week and then into next week and the week after and two again to Christmas."
"1537140","1538480"," Hanukkah, Festivos, all that other shit."
"1538600","1539180"," Whatever it is you celebrate. "
"1542060","1542720"," Oh, you didn't have to."
"1543180","1544200"," Evan didn't have to drive."
"1544480","1548200"," Yeah, that was my one thing I thought about was we did a lot of the. "
"1548920","1551820"," We did like, I love doing nothing."
"1552000","1552780"," We didn't do nothing."
"1554100","1559480"," Matter of fact, yesterday I had more plans and my wife was getting sick. "
"1560240","1567520"," My oldest daughter was getting sick and sick-ish and my wife was gently was like, we don't have to"
"1567520","1568240"," do anything today."

"1616850","1620230"," themselves a wife and they get blood dry. "
"1620490","1623730"," They get, they take them for all their, so what they, these women do is they take these men for"
"1623730","1626250"," all their money and then they go back to the United States broke."
"1626990","1629410"," I don't even know about this, but it's a big industry, right?"
"1629610","1631490"," Or he kicks off and dies, either one, right?"
"1634650","1636070"," No, no, she's got two sons."
"1636570","1637190"," She's a real female. "
"1638170","1639290"," That is funny though."
"1643830","1645210"," I'll tell you guys the truth."
"1645210","1645970"," You guys might know the truth. "
"1646310","1651930"," But it was a, you know, of course it was a topic of conversation because you got people that are"
"1651930","1657690"," like, you know, fuck him and what's he doing and he's going to be taking for all his money and"
"1657690","1659470"," I'm like, yeah, he's, he's all done."

"1661150","1662290"," Let him do whatever he wants to do. "
"1663010","1665490"," So if that's what makes him happy, so be it."
"1666710","1667290"," All right."
"1667330","1668790"," So we're going to go back to a 30 minute chart here. "
"1669910","1671150"," Or excuse me, a one minute chart here."
"1671170","1671930"," We're going to check this out."
"1675610","1677970"," Now the Autobot right now is Bush. "
"1679010","1680530"," Still have no cross to the downside."
"1681030","1682490"," Need to have that cross to get bearish."
"1687100","1688040"," I go back to SPX. "
"1688120","1690080"," Maybe I should go back to SPX so you guys can see this."
"1690820","1692900"," I'm going to leave up SPX down below here."
"1693120","1697760"," So this is basically your gamma, basically your gamma profile here. "
"1700640","1703860"," So leave the SPX get a proof up down below."
"1706040","1707380"," Sounds like a legend to you."
"1707540","1707600"," Yeah. "
"1707800","1708460"," I mean, what is that?"
"1709000","1710800"," He was so my uncle, right?"
"1711080","1712640"," He was married for a long time."
"1712960","1714380"," He was married for handsome guy."
"1715200","1715900"," Very healthy. "
"1716120","1716420"," Never drank."
"1716680","1718620"," He drank when he was younger, but then he gave it up."
"1719340","1719740"," Didn't smoke. "
"1721020","1723440"," Was married with a wife and two children."
"1724140","1726320"," They got a divorce after many years."
"1727220","1729440"," And she went off and got remarried. "
"1730160","1731780"," And his kids are grown up."
"1732260","1733240"," And he's got nobody."
"1734120","1735400"," He doesn't have anybody. "
"1735660","1737400"," He's got, you know, he's getting older."
"1737620","1740740"," This guy is almost 70."
"1742740","1744020"," And he's retired. "
"1744560","1747400"," He has a pension and a retirements and all that kind of stuff."
"1749100","1753660"," And, you know, when he got a divorce, he got kind of black sheep in the family."
"1753660","1754060"," Right?"
"1754200","1759700"," They kind of like not quite disowned him, but they were like, yeah, look, he lost a wife and kids"
"1759700","1760660"," and all that kind of stuff. "
"1760660","1763700"," And so he was very lonely for a bunch of years."
"1764040","1766960"," And he ended up getting to me a lot of bride."
"1767480","1770580"," And he just recently, he just like two weeks ago or something moved. "
"1770820","1772780"," That wasn't maybe two weeks, like a month or two ago."
"1773060","1775420"," But he was the hot topic of conversation with the family, you know."
"1775780","1776860"," Why is he doing that?"
"1777440","1778960"," And I'm like, yeah, she's getting what she wants. "
"1779020","1779980"," And he's getting what he wants."
"1779980","1785960"," So and she what the one good, the one thing I got to say, he isn't like 18 years old."
"1786300","1789700"," She's in her mid 30s, maybe 40s. "
"1790160","1791680"," So it's not terrible."
"1792400","1793100"," It's terrible."
"1793920","1797280"," But it's not like he was dating like an 18 year old or something like that. "
"1797360","1799000"," I'd be like, dude, what are you fucking doing, man?"
"1799420","1801320"," Like can't do that, dude."
"1802520","1809520"," Yeah, he's got, well, in Thailand, he's got fucking money."
"1810880","1813720"," In Thailand, he does, but not in the States. "
"1814720","1817400"," You know, I think that's that's part of the idea of what he's doing."
"1817400","1820820"," So, but that was the topic of conversation, right?"
"1821180","1825100"," And, you know, it's funny is I'm not saying anything."
"1825460","1831780"," And, you know, it's the same people that it's the same people that were mad at him when his divorce"
"1831780","1834600"," and losing his wife and kids and all that other nonsense. "
"1835460","1836900"," You know, they're the same people."
"1836900","1839420"," Well, they're pointing fingers at the same people pointing fingers now."
"1839600","1841800"," And I'm just like, leave the fucking guy alone. "
"1842040","1845540"," Like, if this makes him happy, he's not doing anything bad."
"1845680","1846780"," This person's an adult adult."
"1847780","1849800"," You know, she's getting something out of it. "
"1849800","1850880"," He's getting something out of it."
"1850940","1851420"," So be it."
"1856410","1859850"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"1859850","1863570"," He's very wealthy and he's very wealthy there."
"1864070","1864950"," He does very well."
"1865550","1868690"," But you know, he gets to, he's doing the whole thing, right?"
"1868690","1871690"," Like you build the house for the family and their kids and all that kind of stuff. "
"1872130","1874330"," And when he kicks off and dies, they're going to have a great life."
"1874570","1876390"," And it's mutually beneficial."
"1877230","1878590"," There's a lot of that goes that goes on. "
"1878730","1880130"," I mean, I'm not for I wouldn't do this."
"1880310","1880970"," I wouldn't do that."
"1881150","1884270"," But it happens in the US, right?"
"1884510","1885650"," You know that that happens in the US. "
"1886710","1888290"," It's own right way, right?"
"1888750","1892150"," You'll see some people with money and you're like, yeah, that guy doesn't belong with her."
"1892150","1894650"," Or that you or even that."
"1896430","1898150"," That's in the inverse too, right?"
"1898690","1900230"," You know that that happens in the inverse too. "
"1900410","1901210"," So money power."
"1902430","1905450"," Sometimes people trade for that in life."
"1905450","1907750"," So I understand that it does happen. "
"1909410","1910350"," Come on, man."
"1910710","1911090"," Print me."
"1911950","1912970"," Make me some money, dude. "
"1913190","1913850"," Roll this thing up."
"1913950","1920350"," We've got one minute, five minute cross on the half hour and hour trigger."
"1920830","1924030"," We'll see if this turns into anything where you can get some squeeze and go in here. "
"1925070","1926610"," Try to squeeze out these people."
"1928510","1928850"," Yeah."
"1934420","1935280"," So what is he saying?"
"1935480","1936780"," Fall blog is saying sounds awesome. "
"1936880","1939100"," I've been a talent at 23 and I'll be back at 63."
"1939820","1941820"," So I got nothing that I can say to."
"1942120","1943960"," I got nothing that I can say to him. "
"1944100","1948020"," Like if he was doing something that was illegal here, I'd say that's a problem."
"1948200","1950760"," But he's living it up."
"1950860","1951480"," He's living on a beach. "
"1951480","1953060"," Just bought a new car, bought a new Audi."
"1953340","1955040"," So I think he's doing just fine."
"1958250","1963590"," Yeah, he's got a he's got the compound. "
"1963910","1964430"," He's got everything."
"1964890","1964950"," No."
"1965170","1970450"," Well, they are renting a they're renting a not a compound, but they're renting a condo. "
"1971210","1973730"," And they're looking to build or something like that."
"1974050","1980030"," I'm assuming that from the way the conversations were, but I was involved or I was allowed to be"
"1980030","1980470"," involved in."
"1981090","1985030"," There's layers to this all the 60 and 70 year olds and the 80 year olds. "
"1985070","1987110"," They don't want to tell you to tell you just enough."
"1988370","1993170"," But that they just that I was getting was he'll end up building like homes for the family members"
"1993170","1997310"," and that kind of stuff and a big home for himself and the wife and all that kind of stuff."
"1999830","2003090"," Well, they did the same thing with gringos in Colombia too. "
"2004090","2004870"," I like Columbia."
"2005650","2006790"," I've never been to Columbia."
"2006790","2010850"," I'd like to go to Columbia Columbia and Cuba or on my list. "
"2011630","2014310"," Places that need to go get a little bit across to the upside."
"2014490","2015670"," Now we'll see if we can get a squeeze."
"2016030","2020030"," Whatever squeeze there is, I'm not going to expect to be anything outrageous. "
"2021410","2022750"," We can actually look towards."
"2023770","2027210"," We can actually look towards the high on the 22nd."
"2028150","2029550"," As a speed bump. "
"2029550","2031770"," So if you look at, let's take a look here at."
"2031770","2034690"," Let me switch over here and go to here."
"2042990","2046650"," Let's just take a look back here and I believe this is it right here. "
"2046850","2048969"," So this is the 22nd tie right here."
"2049030","2049630"," Can you guys see this?"
"2049770","2054610"," So if you're looking for a target and upside target for the day."
"2054770","2059810"," If you're bullish, your upside target is right here at our three right up here. "
"2061130","2066810"," Your downside target is going to be right down here or four fifty two."
"2067969","2069830"," And I don't expect a lot today."
"2069909","2071690"," I'm going to expect a lot of this, right?"
"2072030","2073110"," Maybe we can get down here. "
"2073570","2077130"," And it's four fifty two, but I'm going to expect that to get bought later in the week."
"2079270","2082830"," So if you're wondering, if you're wondering like where do I think that we're going, you can see it"
"2082830","2085790"," right here and see it right down there."
"2086270","2090949"," I expect some kind of a like squeeze up, squeeze up and then roll down into Tuesday. "
"2091550","2096370"," Get down to that four fifty two fifty four fifty two twenty one somewhere down in there."
"2102290","2102990"," Morning, Jared."
"2103190","2103530"," How are you doing?"
"2105760","2108820"," I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to rain really like rain. "
"2108920","2110580"," They're like rain drumsticks down."
"2113060","2119460"," Like throwing through an old turkey drumsticks down here trying to trying to send bombs down so the"
"2119460","2120540"," market can roll over."
"2121640","2123480"," So I'll go over a few things here. "
"2124880","2126480"," I'm going to read some stuff to you, okay?"
"2129380","2130640"," We have a busy week coming up."
"2130700","2136220"," We've got new home sales, consumer confidence, GDP, PCE, depending home sales, ISM manufacturing."
"2137140","2138580"," We've got a bunch of Fed speakers this week. "
"2138680","2140780"," We also have Jerome Powell this week."
"2142400","2146300"," Israel and Hamas are looking to extend the pause in fighting as more hostages get released."
"2146300","2149200"," There was some news that I read yesterday. "
"2150360","2159600"," I'll try to bring it up if I can that Hamas dropped some information yesterday that said it didn't"
"2159600","2166160"," get picked up by the wire, but Hamas leaked that this truce might be permanent."
"2166400","2171100"," I'll see if I can find that for you to get you the source on it."
"2172940","2178580"," Elon Musk and Netanyahu visited the Kibbutz, or the Kibbutz that was attacked October 7 on Monday. "
"2180100","2186020"," In terms of black Friday sales, MasterCard says that a US black Friday sales retail sales are up 2 "
"2186020","2192200",".5% year over year, while Cyber Monday online sales to grow on the high single digits range globally"
"2192200","2194100"," and the US according to Salesforce data."
"2194780","2199620"," I wouldn't even expect, I would expect this to be in line in retail and cyber sales."
"2200440","2206640"," You know that they tried to, excuse me. "
"2209820","2219640"," You saw that the prevailing mindset is to"
"2219640","2222580"," do away with black Friday."
"2223660","2228220"," That's been an ongoing thing for the past 5 or 10 years and it seems like it's happening."
"2228220","2234020"," Now, every year on black Friday, I usually go out and do something, go out and about. "
"2234540","2241660"," This year on black Friday, I was out and about and I was shocked at the low number of people"
"2241660","2243160"," out and about."
"2243580","2250020"," The same people were out, they were, you know, like they were easily like the amateur shoppers and"
"2250020","2252480"," amateur drivers and just amateur hour."
"2253140","2256300"," Amateur is driving, amateur is out, amateur is working too. "
"2256300","2259680"," I noticed that the best people weren't out on Friday."
"2261040","2265440"," Over the weekend, I saw some of the best people out working in bars and restaurants and stuff, but"
"2265440","2267940"," once Friday hit, I didn't see that."
"2268180","2275660"," Another fascinating thing that I saw over the weekend was I went to go buy a tree with my brother"
"2275660","2283760"," at Home Depot and I was fascinated because they put out a rinky dink 4 to 5 foot tree and"
"2283760","2286920"," they were like, hey, this is 50 bucks and we're going to showcase it. "
"2287460","2290600"," And I was like, number one, 50 bucks for a tree is a lot of money in a Home Depot."
"2291160","2295160"," Number two, I know they cut trees down on a tree farm."
"2295420","2299940"," I'm like, they're like 8, 7, 8 bucks, 10 bucks a foot at a tree farm typically. "
"2301220","2305560"," So I was a little flabbergasted to see the 8 foot trees were about 80 bucks."
"2306200","2307820"," And I was like, these are the cheapest tree they had."
"2307820","2312580"," And I was like, boy, I was like, you know, this, I was like, this inflation shit. "
"2314140","2319520"," So what's fascinating is I called up, my brother and I are calling up a tree farm where he lives"
"2319520","2321460"," and it was the same price as going Home Depot."
"2322040","2324900"," That's very abnormal to see."
"2325600","2330680"," Normally tree farms are more expensive than a Home Depot. "
"2330940","2333560"," So I was fascinated at that."
"2333560","2335300"," That tree thing kind of bothered me."
"2335640","2339100"," But I could get a fresh tree from a tree farm with the whole thing, right?"
"2339480","2343480"," You get like hot cocoa and cider and you cut the tree down. "
"2344480","2350660"," And it's like, it's all, it's like, it's a pretty nice way to do tree shopping, right?"
"2351020","2354820"," But it's very abnormal to see the pricing just about the same as a Home Depot."
"2355080","2358560"," Home Depot was like just killing it, right?"
"2358860","2362640"," But then again, at that Home Depot we're at, it was dead quiet."
"2363180","2367640"," There was maybe two other people there shopping for trees and they had tons of trees outside. "
"2369080","2371160"," I didn't see like a bunch of people getting trees."
"2371160","2375620"," I didn't see a bunch of missing slots for the trees go."
"2376280","2377360"," And we ended up leaving. "
"2377520","2378880"," We didn't buy the tree at Home Depot."
"2378880","2380880"," We ended up going to cut a tree down for my brother."
"2381320","2383400"," And so that was kind of fascinating as well. "
"2384240","2389460"," So just some things that I noticed, but even noticing the slow crowds on Black Friday."
"2389460","2392880"," I don't do any Black Friday shopping."
"2393400","2394580"," I'm out and about. "
"2394920","2397400"," If I do a Black Friday thing, it's very rare."
"2397700","2398840"," Like I'll go out, but that's about it."
"2399060","2402140"," So no Black Friday for me. "
"2402480","2406420"," So and I don't think most people do Black Friday anymore."
"2406520","2415660"," The only people that I saw out doing Black Friday, to be honest, looked like people that it was"
"2415660","2420680"," either something with kids or it was something where they don't, they're not online savvy."
"2420720","2424880"," They didn't look like they spent a lot of time on the Internet trying to get the best price on"
"2424880","2425600"," stuff, right?"
"2425940","2431680"," So I think we've all moved into that to some extent where we don't partake of that part of the"
"2431680","2432340"," holiday anymore. "
"2432620","2433940"," Or at least the people that I know don't."
"2434080","2439740"," So there's no, I think that I think that holiday is dead that Black Friday holiday is dead."
"2442390","2444130"," But you got the 50 bucks tree. "
"2444350","2444490"," Sweet."
"2445410","2446970"," You did buy the $50 tree."
"2447470","2447950"," Yeah. "
"2448090","2448310"," Oh, yeah."
"2448450","2451990"," Still trying to send hammers down up here on spoos."
"2452970","2454650"," Still trying to send hammers down. "
"2455030","2460030"," Coming down back down to retest again, the previous low on S3."
"2460030","2467170"," So you can get a break of that S3 and get down here to that 452 21 for 250 on"
"2467170","2467790"," spoos."
"2468050","2468210"," Yeah. "
"2468370","2469270"," So it was really bizarre."
"2469630","2474150"," I didn't Friday was kind of a weird, weird experience to be out."
"2474150","2477990"," But I don't know that just because Black Friday sales might not be what you expect. "
"2478410","2482830"," That sales are and the numbers are saying that the number or the numbers are saying that the"
"2482830","2483490"," numbers are the same."
"2483890","2489150"," It's just the format that people are out spending money is different over this holiday."
"2489450","2492470"," And do we started buying our family started buying Christmas presents. "
"2494390","2495690"," Four weeks ago, maybe."
"2496490","2499130"," Four weeks ago, we started buying Christmas presents."
"2499130","2501230"," And so we started making Christmas. "
"2501430","2503830"," My kids are making Christmas presents two weeks ago."
"2504250","2506010"," So we don't really."
"2506170","2507590"," It isn't something that we look forward to. "
"2507810","2509270"," We did a turkey trot though."
"2509310","2512610"," We did a 5k run and that kind of stuff."
"2512870","2512930"," So. "
"2517550","2518490"," Yeah, they did great."
"2518890","2522310"," The retail sales numbers look good for 2.5%. It's pretty good."
"2522490","2528990"," So I'm going to assume that my assumption here is that my assumption here is that the sales will"
"2528990","2529110"," come. "
"2529110","2533670"," And the sales will come in, but not in that one day or one weekend for the season."
"2534030","2535930"," And I don't know."
"2535990","2537750"," I'm not seeing the only pain that I'm seeing. "
"2538510","2540750"," If I had any pain that I'm seeing out there."
"2541290","2544510"," Well, maybe we'll talk about that if we can today, but maybe Joe can harp in on this."
"2545110","2545830"," I'm shocked. "
"2546770","2550790"," I'm shocked at what's going on with."
"2551210","2552990"," You guys know what people are doing out there."
"2554270","2557150"," They're refinancing their mortgages right now. "
"2558570","2560190"," For 8% rates."
"2560990","2561590"," I am."
"2561910","2563610"," This is going to come back to haunt us. "
"2563730","2564990"," Not right now, but it's gonna."
"2565870","2569370"," We need to talk about that because I think that's where that drop comes in the market."
"2569930","2572950"," These people are taking 2, 3% mortgages and they're refying. "
"2573170","2574270"," They can't get hellocks anymore."
"2575630","2576650"," They can't like."
"2579010","2581290"," The debt to income ratio is all fucked up, right?"
"2581470","2585010"," They can't get loans against the houses that they own. "
"2585470","2587950"," And then they're accumulating this debt, right?"
"2588270","2591690"," When somebody was asking me the past few months, people were like, what about this credit card"
"2591690","2591970"," debt?"
"2592610","2594170"," What about this debt people are taking?"
"2595110","2596470"," And they're not going bankrupt."
"2596690","2597230"," That's what they're doing."
"2597490","2598590"," They're refucking financing. "
"2599610","2602270"," Pay off all this bad debt they're taking on their credit card."
"2602410","2604790"," So they're still digging the hole."
"2605910","2607850"," They haven't dug it deep enough yet. "
"2608430","2612530"," They're at like four or four feet, but they've got another two feet to dig."
"2612530","2615470"," And they still haven't quite done it to themselves."
"2616190","2617310"," But they're going to. "
"2617430","2618790"," It's just a matter of time now."
"2619690","2621230"," But does it happen right now?"
"2621230","2622050"," Probably not."
"2623050","2623950"," It's probably. "
"2624570","2627150"," So all these mortgage brokers, they're writing new deals."
"2627690","2632710"," So instead of you paying 2, 3%, 2%, they've got you on the hook now for 8%."
"2633230","2635730"," For all your shit debt that you've got out there. "
"2635890","2637390"," So it's fascinating to see."
"2639810","2640690"," I'm telling you."
"2641110","2642970"," Ask anyone that's writing mortgages right now. "
"2643050","2643930"," So what they're doing is this."
"2644450","2645750"," They're not eligible."
"2646890","2647810"," They're not eligible. "
"2648430","2649670"," Well, there's a couple of things going on."
"2650010","2652150"," So we've had a pullback in housing prices, right?"
"2652310","2654450"," So let's say a house costs $500,000, right?"
"2655190","2656330"," A house costs 500 grand."
"2657150","2661370"," So the house is pulled back to, let's say, $450,000, right?"
"2662110","2663290"," So you bought that house. "
"2663830","2665110"," You didn't come in with 20%."
"2665830","2669570"," You're going to put taking a loan for like 10% down, right?"
"2669750","2670970"," When housing prices were high."
"2671410","2672810"," So now you're upside down. "
"2673850","2674550"," You don't have enough."
"2674750","2676470"," You don't have any equity in that house, right?"
"2676730","2679490"," So you can't take an equity loan, right?"
"2679650","2682930"," Then rates went up and then you're maxing out everything in your credit cards."
"2683550","2691290"," So your debt to income ratio is not, doesn't qualify you for an equity loan or any kind of"
"2691290","2696250"," cheap or loan that's less than 3%, right?"
"2696710","2700010"," So you're like, so what you're doing is you're, you're taking all this bad debt that you have,"
"2700430","2704970"," refiring it 8% and then paying off all this bad debt that you have and just loading these fucking"
"2704970","2706050"," houses up with debt. "
"2707390","2709350"," So it's kind of wild to see."
"2709550","2715350"," And that's what a lot of the, and then you got the origination of all these loans, the money from"
"2715350","2715830"," all that stuff."
"2715910","2721050"," So you've got mortgage writers out there that are writing right now writing, basically writing bad"
"2721050","2726270"," refis for people, but this won't come to a roost right now. "
"2726430","2733670"," This is stuff that this could take six months, two years to come home to roost for these people."
"2733890","2738730"," So it's like every, they're like zigging and zagging and there's, there's people there."
"2739490","2744290"," There's, there's greedy people there at every turn to, uh, to lock these people into terrible"
"2744290","2744650"," loans. "
"2745430","2746750"," That's what people are doing right now."
"2746890","2748490"," That's, that's who's thriving right now."
"2748490","2753430"," Uh, uh, for at least writing, uh, refis right now is where the money is. "
"2754390","2756310"," Some kind of, I'm kind of flabbergasted at that."
"2757430","2758110"," I'm serious."
"2758390","2759230"," That's going on right now. "
"2760590","2761010"," Okay."
"2761290","2763530"," So then we've got, um, we talked about black Friday sales."
"2763730","2764230"," Those are all good. "
"2764410","2768410"," Mastercard says US black Friday retail sales are up 2.5% year over year."
"2768650","2769510"," So I talked to you guys about that."
"2769970","2775530"," Meanwhile, all over in China, industrial profits declines, uh, minus 7.8% year to date versus, uh,"
"2775930","2777610"," mine, minus 9% last year. "
"2778110","2782430"," And the Chinese government is reporting partly considering new support measures for home builders,"
"2782430","2785310"," including unsecured short term loans."
"2786070","2790550"," Uh, you guys got the dealer gamma stuff that I gave to you earlier today on Twitter."
"2790570","2791790"," So I'm not going to go over any of that stuff. "
"2792270","2797710"," Uh, the ball control added 30 billion in equity exposure last week's, uh, due to crashing implied"
"2797710","2798610"," and realized vol."
"2799270","2805450"," We see a chance that, uh, markets will consolidate stick to their range ahead of a month."
"2805450","2809490"," Uh, uh, as we also have a quite a bit of bond supply coming up, according to golden CTA's are"
"2809490","2814330"," now long, 33 billion of US equities and no longer short. "
"2814770","2816610"," This follows the largest monthly buying."
"2816850","2821290"," We have in our data set of, uh, plus 95 billion of US equities."
"2821810","2824670"," Uh, so they've done all their buying at this point. "
"2826070","2827050"," Close that out."
"2829590","2831110"," What else I got for you here?"
"2832190","2833930"," Uh, let me see if I got anything else for you here."
"2833930","2836450"," I love it. "
"2836470","2838190"," I'm in all the Google gloom and here in abroad."
"2838370","2840250"," US stock market is holding up just fine."
"2841010","2841890"," Uh, I don't know. "
"2841990","2846250"," I think that's a, I think that's a tease for suckers to come out and buy the market, but, uh,"
"2846470","2847410"," so be it, whatever that is."
"2849750","2851130"," I got nothing else for you here."
"2852510","2853810"," Uh, hold on here. "
"2855130","2857210"," Let's get some analyst calls in here for you this morning."
"2860770","2863070"," So I can go through some of these here for you at some point."
"2865650","2866850"," We watch the news. "
"2868350","2870010"," It's just droopy market here."
"2872150","2873710"," They really try to hold on a second."
"2873790","2874510"," I got to switch over. "
"2874650","2875130"," Hold on a second here."
"2891030","2892930"," I got to get, I got to get ready to buy some puts here."
"2893090","2893290"," Hold on. "
"2900610","2901550"," I think tight here."
"2906480","2907840"," Look at what's happening on that."
"2908180","2911000"," Just, they just keep slamming into that support on SPX. "
"2912460","2914280"," Need to get underneath this here."
"2915460","2916980"," Almost a roll coming up here."
"2917140","2917920"," Not quite, but almost. "
"2921650","2922390"," That up."
"2925880","2926920"," That 452."
"2934240","2935720"," Right down there. "
"2937080","2939540"," If they can get there right down there."
"2942340","2945140"," Let's see if these, we'll see if these sellers can get down there."
"2948160","2954890"," Yeah, they're getting the fees, man. "
"2954890","2957870"," They're getting the fees and they're getting the percentage now."
"2958230","2960190"," That's how these banks are surviving Joe."
"2960690","2964130"," Take it from from two to 3% up to 8% in the fees. "
"2968050","2970210"," It's totally being marketed hard."
"2970410","2970990"," Totally dude."
"2972110","2972670"," Absolutely. "
"2973670","2973930"," Okay."
"2974310","2975450"," So we'll go over some."
"2975730","2979570"," So the third bidding here for two year notes totaling $622 million. "
"2979570","2983430"," Let me turn the six month bills at $5.1 billion there."
"2984550","2986690"," Turn this squacker down."
"2993130","2994570"," We've got no news today. "
"2994810","2996610"," Tomorrow we've got a case shiller."
"2997090","2997810"," Home price index."
"2997890","2998530"," Talk about that. "
"2999150","3000350"," We've also have consumer confidence."
"3000630","3002190"," That's at 10 a.m. tomorrow."
"3002570","3005090"," We get a ton of Fed speakers tomorrow. "
"3005370","3006910"," We've got Chris Waller."
"3007710","3008930"," Austin Guelsby."
"3009650","3010110"," Bowman Barr. "
"3010770","3011910"," Barr, I think he speaks twice."
"3012710","3018510"," Wednesday, we've got GDP first revision at revision at 8.30 a.m. We've got a trade balance at 8 "
"3018510","3023970",".30 a.m. Then we've got Loretta Mester speaking at 1.45. We have the beige book at 2 p "
"3023970","3024690",".m. on Wednesday."
"3025290","3029090"," On Thursday, we've got initial jobless claims at 8.30 personal income. "
"3029690","3036270"," So it's PCI stuff, PCE at 8.30. And then we've got John Williams speaking at 9.05. And we've"
"3036270","3043490"," got the Chicago business barometer PMI at 9.45. Then we've got pending home sales at 10 a.m. On"
"3043490","3045830"," Friday, we've got Michael Barr speaking ISM manufacturing."
"3047650","3049850"," That's at 10 a.m. and then construction spending at 10."
"3050290","3055190"," 3 a.m. is Michael Barr speaking, believe it or not, on Friday at 3 a.m. At 10 a "
"3055190","3058950",".m. we've got Google's B speaking at 10 a.m. on Friday. "
"3059690","3062830"," We've got Jerome Powell speaking at 11 a.m. on Friday."
"3063950","3069610"," And we also have Jerome Powell and Lisa Cook speaking to local leaders on Friday at 2 p.m. So"
"3069610","3073870"," two speeches by Jerome Powell on Friday."
"3074090","3078250"," So a big week coming up in terms of some volatility. "
"3078570","3082450"," We've got some volatility this week and hopefully we've got some volatility coming this week."
"3082470","3084150"," Some kind of volatility to get down a little bit."
"3087050","3091490"," Yeah, I think Joe, I think the thing that, hey legend, thanks for resubbing brother. "
"3092510","3099690"," I think the thing here is if all these mortgage brokers are going to go out of business, what do"
"3099690","3100230"," they do, right?"
"3100410","3105790"," They just, if they can't originate new business, they have to, they have to like, this reminds me,"
"3105850","3108870"," this reminds me of a late stage shit right here."
"3112260","3118960"," To be honest with you, it reminds me of some late stage like, let's put that in one minute so"
"3118960","3120120"," you can see it more clearly here."
"3121040","3122480"," See if this pin holds or not. "
"3124240","3124880"," Thanks, legend."
"3124880","3125640"," I appreciate it, man."
"3126660","3129080"," We're gonna talk about Tesla today as well, right?"
"3129720","3132420"," We got a lot of stuff to talk about Tesla today. "
"3134760","3140720"," Tesla investor relations head Martin Visha has provided some key details about the upcoming"
"3140720","3144500"," Cybertruck first delivery event, which is scheduled to be held at the Gigafactory Texas this"
"3144500","3150380"," Thursday on the 30th contrary to other Tesla events like the cyber rodeo and Cybertruck's first"
"3150380","3150600"," deliveries."
"3151280","3156960"," We'll be starting notably earlier as noted by Martin, the Tesla Cybertruck delivery event will be"
"3156960","3161020"," starting at 1 p.m. Central time 11 a.m. Pacific Standard time."
"3161780","3165740"," Expectations are high that Tesla will be live streaming the event, although the executive has not"
"3165740","3169040"," provided information about when the live stream or the occasion will go live. "
"3169560","3173760"," The Cybertruck delivery event starts at 1 p.m. on Thursday, so that's central time in case"
"3173760","3175720"," anybody's unsure about that."
"3176560","3177900"," And then what else we got here?"
"3179820","3184920"," The update from Tesla executive surprised some electric vehicle advocates on social media,"
"3185400","3189860"," especially considering that Tesla typically holds its vehicle's first delivery events in the U.S."
"3189940","3190240"," at night."
"3190800","3196640"," Tesla held an inaugural customer customer delivery event in the afternoon in Giga Shanghai for the"
"3196640","3201460"," Model 3, but that was in China, not the U.S. In the U.S. vehicles like the Model Y"
"3201460","3203780"," and Model 3 saw their first deliveries at night. "
"3204380","3207700"," Interestingly enough, holding the Cybertruck's first deliveries in the afternoon means that"
"3207700","3211840"," electric vehicle enthusiasts from European countries such as Germany would be able to view the"
"3211840","3214140"," event at just around 8 p.m. local time."
"3214680","3218360"," However, in countries such as Australia, which is a large market for pickup trucks, the"
"3218360","3222000"," Cybertruck's first delivery event would be starting very early at 6 a.m. local time."
"3222800","3225720"," The excitement surrounding the Cybertruck's first deliveries is notable. "
"3226060","3230080"," This was hinted at by the attention that the Cybertruck has been receiving in Tesla's physical"
"3230080","3236180"," stores across the U.S. Over the weekend alone, posts on social media platforms such as X indicated"
"3236180","3241100"," that Cybertruck's display units in select Tesla stores are attracting quite a bit of attention from"
"3241100","3241360"," visitors."
"3242220","3249100"," Tesla bulls such as the Future Funds, Gary Black, have also stated that Cybertruck could have a"
"3249100","3252640"," halo effect of sorts for the company's EV lineup."
"3253400","3259540"," So let's take a look at Tesla really quick because I know some of you guys out there are, let's"
"3259540","3261000"," take a look at Tesla really quick. "
"3261960","3265560"," Some of you guys are all chomping at the bit for Tesla."
"3265560","3269820"," I wish I had a chart to show you."
"3283300","3305210"," I think I"
"3305210","3305530"," did guys. "
"3353920","3356980"," Okay, so let's talk briefly about Tesla."
"3357880","3364960"," Now, the idea here Tesla loves to trade its daily velocity."
"3365760","3367660"," Period, like just loves it. "
"3367960","3372860"," If you don't have, if you have the tool, if I've given you the tool in your Tesla lover, you"
"3372860","3378040"," can just look back in history on Tesla and the daily velocity on it."
"3378640","3380580"," And it fucking loves it."
"3380880","3385440"," So the expectation right now, if you will get this down move right here, right?"
"3385800","3387800"," We are right here right now. "
"3388700","3394240"," And we also coincidentally have the daily trigger starting to come higher here."
"3394240","3399780"," That's the idea would be that we're going to squeeze up, smash off that weekly trigger and then"
"3399780","3401900"," make this huge blast off, right?"
"3402020","3403380"," That's the idea at least."
"3404000","3407260"," And velocity is telling us that same story right now. "
"3407260","3408820"," So if you have velocity over here, right?"
"3409320","3410340"," Is your next example."
"3411340","3413520"," You've got daily velocity down below here, right?"
"3414080","3415100"," And it was negative, right?"
"3415260","3416920"," So you're buying this negative velocity."
"3417540","3420860"," You're not buying positive velocity way up here, right?"
"3421040","3422260"," You're buying it way down here. "
"3422260","3426140"," And it's just starting to become bullish right now on Tesla."
"3426460","3429480"," A lot of bellows looks great right now on Tesla."
"3429940","3436600"," So if you're on a 30 minute chart on Tesla at home, what is happening is look right here, right?"
"3436740","3438840"," This big swooping yellow line comes up. "
"3439460","3442380"," You see that daily velocity just starts to ramp, right?"
"3443120","3447340"," Breaks through this emotional level here, this orange line, this is your weekly."
"3448180","3450440"," We have that same thing happening right now."
"3450440","3452800"," So I want you to see it as it happens. "
"3453360","3456820"," So right now we have a like a six trigger bull cluster."
"3457160","3458440"," You can move this over here."
"3458760","3460500"," Oh, I'll just get rid of it. "
"3461100","3462800"," No, no, no, get rid of that."
"3467160","3470120"," You've got a six trigger bull cluster happening here, right?"
"3470240","3471540"," You've got the first limit."
"3472420","3473140"," Oh, no. "
"3474040","3475940"," You've got the first slam up here, right?"
"3476660","3478480"," You get the next slam up up here."
"3478480","3481000"," You take out that one, right?"
"3481120","3482180"," It comes back down again."
"3482180","3484760"," And then you get this crossover of the daily trigger. "
"3485420","3488700"," And before you know, you've got a six trigger cluster, a major one too."
"3488780","3490900"," This isn't like a one minute, a five minutes."
"3491160","3494200"," This is an hourly, a half hour, a weekly and a daily. "
"3494820","3499040"," You can see the demand down below right here just smashing, smashing, smashing."
"3500200","3500360"," Right?"
"3500580","3505120"," So if you haven't gotten on the Tesla train at this point, the idea would be that we should trade"
"3505120","3505720"," up here."
"3505720","3507480"," Take this bad boy out. "
"3508400","3510120"," I'd love to see that one get taken."
"3510240","3510900"," I'd love to see."
"3511700","3512880"," I'd love to see. "
"3513560","3515040"," Maybe I should make that yellow."
"3515780","3516640"," I probably shouldn't have wrote."
"3517180","3518480"," I probably shouldn't have made that red. "
"3519100","3519980"," It should be more yellow."
"3521340","3524100"," And then this one here should be reddish."
"3526300","3527820"," Like reddish right there. "
"3528800","3529720"," Maybe I make that orange."
"3530440","3531720"," I make that orange."
"3532920","3533880"," Yellow orange. "
"3535120","3536300"," Dude, what are they doing?"
"3538140","3539380"," Yellow orange, right?"
"3539600","3540820"," So you got like smash up."
"3541360","3542520"," Smash up here."
"3543400","3544820"," And then the big bad boy. "
"3545320","3545980"," Half thereafter."
"3547040","3548100"," What would be the next target?"
"3548360","3549540"," I think we talked about that too."
"3549600","3550680"," And that's way up here. "
"3551220","3552880"," This would be your next target up here."
"3553460","3554800"," You're going to definitely have."
"3556060","3556840"," Hold on. "
"3557140","3557860"," I draw that one in there."
"3559520","3561080"," You get a target right there."
"3561080","3562800"," And you get a target right here. "
"3567160","3568120"," 252-263."
"3569100","3570280"," Stuff like that."
"3571220","3573040"," You even get higher, right?"
"3573140","3574020"," Look at how high that is. "
"3574180","3583480"," So I guess if you're super bullish, you're looking for 300."
"3597130","3598850"," Now, we know the events coming."
"3599030","3602050"," We know you're going to be loaded to the tips on calls, right?"
"3602910","3605650"," Is it going to print the event?"
"3606410","3608330"," Normally it doesn't, right?"
"3608530","3612490"," If you're also bullish, look for a dip if you can. "
"3613550","3615730"," That 224 to actually make that trade."
"3616290","3624890"," Or put it out one strike farther out than the event, the near strike on Tesla."
"3626170","3629990"," So if you're looking for like Tesla to go up here, if you think Tesla's going up, if you think"
"3629990","3633770"," the event is going to be positive, I think it's going to be positive. "
"3633770","3639910"," I don't know if the options market's going to pay you out for this event, but normally they won't"
"3639910","3640910"," until after, right?"
"3641050","3642390"," Then you get the ramp days later."
"3643450","3648290"," So you might get it on during the Tesla, the Cybertruck event."
"3648690","3649650"," I think you're going to get it. "
"3649770","3653950"," The one thing I'm going to say to you about this, I want to tell you one thing about Tesla,"
"3654230","3654410"," okay?"
"3655890","3658590"," I got a warning for you, okay?"
"3659030","3665210"," I told you guys when this was going to kick off a year ago, I told you nine months ago"
"3665210","3668390"," I told you what was going to happen coming into the end of the year."
"3668770","3675390"," But there was a second part to that conversation that I told you that you probably don't have"
"3675390","3677670"," yourself looking at right now that you need to."
"3678090","3679470"," And that would be deliveries. "
"3680490","3688170"," And I was told from someone that I trust that seems to know what they're talking about, that there"
"3688170","3690750"," should be major delays in deliveries."
"3691290","3693290"," That won't be the focus right now."
"3693510","3695330"," So it shouldn't be. "
"3695570","3696510"," This is a good time, right?"
"3696610","3697450"," They're going to launch this truck."
"3698030","3699470"," And you should be happy about it."
"3699530","3705510"," But I would say to you in the back of your mind that if we're cranking on Tesla, keep that"
"3705510","3709250"," in the back of your mind that that would be the catalyst for bad news down the road. "
"3709730","3714190"," That oopsie, we simply could deliver X amount of units and we're not actually going to be able to"
"3714190","3714550"," do that."
"3714810","3715890"," So that's not right now."
"3716010","3717170"," You're the one thing you're focused on. "
"3717230","3720630"," You should be focused on is this event for Tesla."
"3720630","3721990"," I'm bullish on it."
"3722210","3727450"," I don't know if I'm bullish on it for this expiry, but within the next one to two exp..."
"3727450","3730910"," The next two to three expiries, I think you're going to get the move that you're looking for. "
"3731410","3734110"," And I think you've got a 300 on tap."
"3734610","3735930"," It's set up to go to 300."
"3736450","3741250"," So if you can catch this bad boy right down in here, make some kind of nice, like swooping action. "
"3743950","3747870"," If at any point you can catch that to ride that bad boy up to that 300."
"3748630","3749610"," Have at it."
"3749750","3753170"," If you don't want to mess around, it just gets some Paul spreads something like that. "
"3753390","3756290"," But overall, I'm pretty fucking bullish here in Tesla."
"3757030","3763190"," If you're not bullish on Tesla, let me know if you're not bullish on Tesla."
"3764990","3766630"," I'm fairly bullish here. "
"3766830","3772570"," So in the charts say it to the tool saying and everything saying to be bullish on Tesla, the only"
"3772570","3782310"," thing that I'd be concerned about would be the only concern that I would have would be the fucking"
"3782310","3783230"," dealers, man."
"3783570","3789150"," You need waterfall call buying, waterfall underlying buying, all that stuff on your side."
"3789350","3793490"," And you can then make the dealers chase you on Tesla, which can happen. "
"3795290","3798110"," So, you know, but you know how it is."
"3798110","3801150"," You know, you guys know how Tesla is, man."
"3801270","3806110"," You just like every reason it's supposed to go up and like wherever it is, it has this giant"
"3806110","3806650"," pullback. "
"3806650","3811930"," And you wake up one morning and you're like, whoa, we're down fucking four or five percent and"
"3811930","3812570"," you're all panicky."
"3812770","3815810"," That's actually the time you should be buying on that panic heading into that event."
"3815810","3816450"," It could happen. "
"3817150","3819950"," I'll be leading with the two-year note results."
"3820650","3821850"," Hey, H-bomb, how are you doing?"
"3822350","3823470"," It's already afternoon here."
"3824130","3825490"," Hopefully it's not afternoon yet. "
"3826250","3828450"," Dude, like seriously print this shit for me."
"3829270","3829990"," Fucking prints."
"3834140","3835640"," Do some kind of movements. "
"3836980","3837960"," Give me an explosion."
"3837960","3839880"," Look at that coiling on spooze right now."
"3839960","3840420"," That's PX. "
"3840700","3841200"," Just coiling."
"3841900","3842800"," Just begging."
"3852530","3854770"," I'm loading up on some calls right now. "
"3855030","3855310"," Mad more."
"3858840","3860840"," Mad more to my position here."
"3864440","3865480"," Ping pong, baby. "
"3865780","3866160"," Ping pong."
"3868480","3869520"," You need me to draw."
"3869920","3870800"," You guys want me to draw?"
"3871360","3872960"," You guys want me to draw some. "
"3872960","3874000"," I'm a six percent."
"3874140","3875920"," That's the two-year pre-sale winning studio."
"3876020","3878640"," Four spot eight, seven, six percent ahead of this. "
"3878780","3879960"," Fifty four billion dollar sale."
"3880440","3881720"," Is this car like it?"
"3881820","3886920"," Is he like at home calling in from the office and he's like, he's like short more."
"3888260","3888900"," Fuck it. "
"3889000","3889660"," Just buy puts."
"3889980","3893560"," You want to stay up late with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for you on"
"3893560","3894100"," payrolls?"
"3894680","3900160"," Then sign up today and get our special offer of financial use pro for years worth our service for"
"3900160","3903140"," the price of one month and say ninety two percent."
"3903840","3908020"," Yeah, so I'd be like so if you are if you are a Tesla bull, right?"
"3908200","3912300"," Just keep that in the back of your mind as you come into some major as you can. "
"3912420","3914020"," It's any kind of major resistance."
"3914120","3917460"," So let's say test that squeezing blast off hits 300."
"3918400","3924500"," And you know, you hear tests come out and say something crazy like Oh, by the way, like we're"
"3924500","3928080"," delivering 10,000 units and they're going to be very specific people. "
"3928080","3931240"," So these two year notes, and six month bill auctions."
"3931720","3933940"," I'll be eating with the two year notes, a bit to cover ratio."
"3934300","3937400"," And the plebs aren't getting it for getting cyber tracks for another year or two. "
"3937540","3938300"," Something like that."
"3938520","3939400"," Like one full year."
"3940100","3941120"," You hear that news?"
"3941920","3943660"," Remember we had that conversation here in the show, right?"
"3943880","3945180"," You have something like that pops out. "
"3945560","3947340"," Don't be like, Oh, nobody told me."
"3951740","3952300"," A lot here."
"3953400","3954460"," Hey, stay humble or get humbled. "
"3954540","3955020"," How are you doing, man?"
"3955740","3956560"," Good to see you brother."
"3956860","3957060"," Sister."
"3958220","3958780"," Hey, can I be helped?"
"3958980","3959260"," How are you?"
"3959260","3959740"," Stacey. "
"3959740","3960200"," How are you?"
"3961540","3962120"," You were."
"3962200","3962600"," Yeah, it's right."
"3962820","3966600"," Stacey just said it's cheaper than 20% credit card rates. "
"3966740","3967980"," I'm so fucking lutely."
"3968620","3971180"," So Stacey just said it's cheaper than 20% rates."
"3971380","3972740"," And I then that's what people are doing, right?"
"3972880","3973640"," They're getting cornered. "
"3973960","3974860"," Hold up that lifestyle."
"3975280","3976080"," All that stuff."
"3976380","3981080"," And if they can get 8% rather than 20 rather than 30, some people paying 30% their credit"
"3981080","3981960"," cards might as well. "
"3982380","3990180"," And the other question too is how many people don't pay that money from refi and pay down their"
"3990180","3990420"," debt."
"3990900","3992840"," That's the next that's the next big question, right?"
"3992980","3996320"," Do they actually pay their debt down or do they maintain that lifestyle?"
"3996520","3999160"," They scale back a little bit or not."
"3999160","4000340"," That's all important stuff. "
"4000500","4003800"," 87% for spot 8, 8, 7%."
"4003800","4006020"," The assault at $54 billion."
"4006620","4007740"," Rewarding a 70 spot. "
"4007860","4009420"," One five percent of bits of time."
"4009860","4011340"," Primary dealers take 18 spots."
"4011340","4014580"," 76% of the sale direct 23 spot. "
"4014740","4019800"," 86% indirect 57 spot of 38% for the six month bill auction."
"4020120","4021900"," The high rate was five spot to four percent."
"4022220","4025380"," Five spot to four percent with a bit to cover of three spot zero one. "
"4025460","4027620"," So it's three spot zero one for the six month."
"4027860","4028240"," It's cover."
"4031040","4036820"," So in the six month, the US sold $73 billion awarded 89 spot nine, six percent of bits at high. "
"4042080","4043560"," So again, the US two units."
"4043880","4046140"," So they're at four spot eight, eight, seven percent."
"4046560","4047720"," That is against the pre sale. "
"4047880","4050360"," When issued deal to four spot, eight, seven, six percent."
"4054410","4058510"," You're saying, uh, breakdown share of saying tick tock is full of field bitching about I'm living"
"4058510","4059350"," from paycheck to paycheck."
"4059570","4060270"," What kind of life is this?"
"4061450","4063990"," Um, there's a lot of answers to that. "
"4064930","4074850"," I saw one guy last night say, um, he said, he said, uh, well,"
"4074910","4076870"," I'm not going to say what he said, but it was pure stupidity."
"4077810","4082570"," I from my perspective, if I was looking from looking at this being older, it looks like they're"
"4082570","4084810"," resetting everything for young people."
"4084810","4086350"," It looks like you're going to get higher wages. "
"4087130","4092210"," Uh, but you're going to have to spend 10 to 20 years working your balls off to ever be right"
"4092210","4092490"," side."
"4094770","4098910"," Uh, Come on."
"4104510","4106130"," Yeah, Stacy's saying they pay off. "
"4106310","4106830"," Oh, wait a minute."
"4106970","4108689"," We got a David AMS saying bond action soon."
"4108850","4111010"," Books were cleared of liquidity on book map. "
"4111229","4116569"," UT closed was long, but closed Stacy saying they pay off credit card to get a new credit card at"
"4116569","4118290"," a better rate than Jack that one up later."
"4118850","4121310"," Uh, Jesus man, I can't believe we're doing that."
"4122189","4126450"," Rocket surgeon saying it took out a 13% personal and paid off both 30% credit cards. "
"4126770","4128149"," I'm only using my debit card now."
"4128250","4130529"," I think a few people max out of the Christmas and then default."
"4131710","4137689"," Yeah, I was wondering, like that's my question is like refying and paying down their debt or they"
"4137689","4138910"," just saying, yeah, fuck it. "
"4138990","4139710"," Let's spend more money."
"4140430","4142050"," Uh, that's what my mom did that."
"4142529","4143750"," Mom did that once. "
"4144569","4146710"," Uh, in 1987 during the crash in 1987."
"4147410","4150670"," Uh, they had, they had done something very similar to that."
"4150750","4153330"," They were, they were overextended across the board everywhere. "
"4153850","4157250"," Uh, and they got caught in the crash and it was ugly."
"4157729","4159029"," They got caught with their pants down."
"4159410","4160710"," It was absolutely terrible. "
"4163029","4163890"," What do we got on?"
"4164069","4164649"," What's going on?"
"4164649","4165430"," What's going on over there?"
"4167850","4169630"," Uh, people are filling the squeeze."
"4170630","4173790"," The, um, I don't know, you know, it's weird."
"4174130","4175590"," Joe Donut is here with us this morning. "
"4175590","4178410"," Him and I were, him and I were talking about that."
"4178569","4180330"," As a matter of fact, a whole bunch of us on Twitter were talking about us."
"4180450","4183450"," Fin to it years ago, like two, three years ago. "
"4184130","4190450"," We were all talking about paying down our mortgages and trying to get debt free."
"4190630","4193050"," I remember that whole conversation and it was fascinating."
"4193450","4198470"," Like Fin to it had this big conversation about, uh, do I sell my house now and take the money"
"4198470","4200290"," and run if the housing market's going to crash?"
"4200370","4202670"," Is this the time or is it how far down the road?"
"4202770","4203410"," Is it when it happens?"
"4203610","4204990"," Uh, it was a lot of conversations. "
"4205070","4210930"," I remember at that time period, uh, I had paid off my, uh, I paid off my last mortgage."
"4211870","4215030"," Uh, when did I also find out when I put off my last mortgage?"
"4215210","4221150"," But, uh, I tried to get square with debt heading into or out of COVID."
"4221790","4225390"," Uh, I was afraid of where we are right now, right?"
"4225490","4230570"," I was, I was definitely afraid of where we are right now, uh, which is something bad happens,"
"4230570","4230910"," right?"
"4231170","4233510"," Uh, Mary, the landscaper has her new truck. "
"4233550","4234330"," She's got a new equipment."
"4234490","4237390"," She's got new business and she'll be fine for a few years."
"4237390","4242830"," But once they start jacking up those rates and the equipment starts getting old and then you're"
"4242830","4247190"," asked to reinvest in that stuff, like, Hey, do you want to go back in and buy a new lawnmower"
"4247190","4250270"," or new truck and you afford $140,000 of the 20%?"
"4250470","4250910"," I don't know. "
"4251070","4255850"," They're going to have 20, but you know, you're going to, you're going to pay in, uh, well, I guess"
"4255850","4259550"," right now it's not too bad by the car, but basically you want to get car rates up at like,"
"4259550","4262470"," you know, 15%, 10%, eight, nine percent."
"4262890","4267370"," Uh, and refinance and her mortgage on her fucking business building and all that out of the crap."
"4268170","4272590"," Um, their taxes need to go up and all that of the stuff trapped with the pain, uh, twist the"
"4272590","4273190"," screws on her. "
"4273290","4274430"," So we're still not there, right?"
"4274670","4277650"," Point is that they're still refinancing all this shit debt."
"4278390","4281830"," Uh, now for eight percent loans, like a 30% loan down, eight percent loans."
"4281990","4285570"," So we need them to make me more time, I guess is where I'm at the point I'm trying to"
"4285570","4285750"," make. "
"4286190","4290950"," Six months a year, uh, maybe two to three figure how long can these people stay in their houses"
"4290950","4294130"," after they declare bankruptcy and all these people?"
"4294450","4296270"," How long they sit in their houses before they have to move?"
"4296270","4300350"," Uh, and do you guys, some of you guys might be young might not know this, but when they started"
"4300350","4304830"," foreclosing an 0708, people were living in their houses for years."
"4305570","4310470"," Uh, not paying their mortgage, then they would go bankrupt, then they wouldn't get, wouldn't get"
"4310470","4314910"," kicked out, be served, get kicked out of their house homes, uh, and they would stay in their homes"
"4314910","4315630"," for years."
"4316010","4322010"," Like you're talking sometimes two, three years, uh, just stacking cash, uh, to try to make their"
"4322010","4324230"," way out of whatever shit they're in. "
"4324230","4325990"," So this could last even longer, right?"
"4326190","4329870"," We like, I'm looking at that stuff this past weekend and I'm like, that doesn't mean shit."
"4330030","4334590"," Like these people could be, uh, these people could be running around for at least another two,"
"4334590","4337210"," three years, uh, before they really feel the pain."
"4337730","4343850"," So I don't expect any like mass bankruptcies or max or like, or like the devastation everybody's"
"4343850","4344470"," talking about. "
"4345050","4346530"," I don't see it right now."
"4346550","4349090"," It could be a long process if it even happens."
"4349510","4350530"," If it even happens. "
"4354660","4355840"," So who's this right here?"
"4356160","4360920"," Uh, the Ocho is saying, uh, my business shucked and sold off everything heavy."
"4361440","4364320"," We're renting any equipment that needs a trailer to move now."
"4364320","4367000"," Didn't want to get stuck having to finance the big shit anymore. "
"4367480","4368920"," Yeah, that sounds right, dude."
"4369140","4370480"," That sounds right, Ocho, man."
"4371000","4373560"," That's what we have a friend here in the broadcast. "
"4373560","4380840"," I'm not going to tell you who they are, but this person is, uh, a business to business equipment"
"4380840","4382520"," seller, uh, big one."
"4382520","4384100"," One of the biggest in the United States."
"4384180","4390660"," We got a guy in our audience here that's, uh, owns a company that has one, what, like, if you"
"4390660","4396280"," are, who, I don't know, well, you probably have seen or used, you have probably, like, I'm going to"
"4396280","4400480"," give it about a 95% chance that you have used his equipment out there. "
"4400840","4407620"," And he has said the same thing or something similar, uh, that they're at that late stage debt cycle"
"4407620","4410140"," where these companies are starting to just use what they got."
"4410140","4412120"," Use what you got, maximize profits."
"4412980","4414540"," Um, but how long can this last?"
"4414840","4415740"," Probably two, three years. "
"4416340","4418640"," Um, so sometime in the future here."
"4420140","4421460"," Dude, come on."
"4422980","4424580"," Like, come on. "
"4424820","4425360"," It's driving me."
"4425480","4431060"," I wanted to come on this morning and stream for you and just tell you, like, this is what say"
"4431060","4431560"," is going to be."
"4432200","4437140"," Some global ratings note that Germany's growth could suffer from the top court's decision. "
"4437580","4438280"," What do you say?"
"4438340","4440920"," Unemployment hurts more now than in 2007."
"4441180","4443260"," The cost of a lot of things got up 50% of that time."
"4443540","4445540"," So it won't take 5% employment to get things flying. "
"4446540","4448300"," Uh, that's Otter Nabuga saying that."
"4449020","4451120"," Yeah, I think they're teaching people to live."
"4451600","4452340"," You know what, Otter Nabuga?"
"4452520","4459900"," And the only thing that's steady on that is the one thing that I notice, uh, is they're training"
"4459900","4466180"," people in my view to accept, uh, cheaper shit in general. "
"4466700","4474600"," Uh, cheaper, cheaper experience, like worse experiences, uh, worse service, worse, um, worse"
"4474600","4480200"," quality and it goes downhill and more downhill and more downhill as the years pass."
"4481080","4482420"," Uh, and people are fine with it."
"4482740","4484860"," Does that ever come to a head?"
"4486340","4487240"," I don't know, man. "
"4488340","4492680"," Uh, it reminds me a lot of Asia reminds me a lot of, uh, it reminds me a lot of"
"4492680","4498200"," Korea and I was spent some time in Korea in Japan and it reminds me a lot of like, um,"
"4499580","4504680"," You see it in like clothing, like the cheapness of clothing and the throw awareness of everything"
"4504680","4510640"," that we have today and, uh, planned obsolescence and everything today and then paying for services"
"4510640","4513300"," like heated car seats and stuff like that in a month."
"4513580","4518840"," Like everything is like, it's like just turn the screws, turn the screws, turn the screws and we're"
"4518840","4521580"," going to teach you along the way that this is acceptable."
"4522400","4527860"," That's the scary part is you're accepting like, when I speak to a kid, like my kids love self"
"4527860","4530240"," checkout and I'm like, this is terrible. "
"4531100","4533440"," Uh, it's okay for me, daddy, right?"
"4533640","4538240"," I'm fine with it and I'm like, yeah, but you're, you're getting less from that."
"4538760","4541460"," Uh, and they, they, they seem to be fine with it."
"4541580","4544480"," So that's the one thing they noticed getting older is it's time passes. "
"4545320","4551420"," We accept less and less quality and, uh, younger generations are being trained, uh, to perceive"
"4551420","4556060"," quality as less, uh, in paying higher prices."
"4557400","4558560"," Yeah, it's the, exactly."
"4558800","4560420"," It's the enshitification of the American dream. "
"4560840","4562640"," That's what it is, brother."
"4563000","4569460"," Even the, so I just got a new phone and I'm not getting messages from, uh, because I went from"
"4569460","4571320"," iPhone to Android this past couple of weeks."
"4571560","4577080"," I'm not getting any messages from anybody I know because of that garden, but the enshitification is"
"4577080","4577900"," real man. "
"4577900","4581620"," I was thinking about this switch over to everything's a fucking app."
"4582120","4583660"," Everything's its own goddamn garden."
"4584060","4585620"," Like every app is its own garden. "
"4586020","4590200"," I have to transfer all this crap over and then they, and then they want me to spend the time"
"4590200","4590620"," there too."
"4590660","4593600"," Like you've got to spend time in this app for it to work."
"4594080","4597000"," So everyone, now every aspect of my life has an app. "
"4597320","4599940"," Every aspect of that app is junk."
"4600680","4602260"," So I'm stuck in this shit."
"4602820","4608320"," You know, it's the same with like charging cables and power cables and then apps for everything. "
"4608500","4610220"," It's just nonstop garbage."
"4610940","4616840"," I was talking to my two daughters this weekend and we were driving and we were chatting and my"
"4616840","4619100"," oldest daughter is becoming so smart, right?"
"4619560","4624100"," And listens to me when I talked to her and I'm like, and she's, she's like daddy, why?"
"4624520","4628840"," And I was like, you know the fact that you're even interested in why I'm angry about this is like,"
"4628840","4629800"," I love you."
"4630200","4633020"," I love you to death because you're actually care. "
"4633200","4634940"," And I'm, and she's like, why though, daddy?"
"4634940","4636600"," And I'm like, well, like let me open my phone here."
"4637280","4643460"," I'm like, if I have a laptop open or a computer open and a phone open and my online experience"
"4643460","4646500"," is horrible on a laptop."
"4647040","4651460"," It's gotten slowly, it's eroded slowly over time, but phones, it's like the worst. "
"4652400","4655800"," Like it's just like, it's like completely shitified."
"4656460","4660200"," Online experience completely shitified website experience."
"4660660","4663680"," I got pop ups and pop ups and pop ups and pop ups. "
"4663680","4665100"," It's just out of control."
"4667340","4668660"," Yeah, even for shopping, right?"
"4668820","4672680"," Best deals, you have to go to the individual store apps and sign up for the text, your second phone"
"4672680","4673560"," number just for shopping."
"4673900","4674940"," Yeah, it's out of control. "
"4675280","4677620"," So it's out of fucking control."
"4677920","4678640"," It really is."
"4679960","4682060"," It makes me not want to participate. "
"4685480","4688200"," I don't know if they make you believe that that's good."
"4688420","4689900"," I don't know if that's heading towards depression."
"4689900","4693840"," It's saying this is acceptable, right?"
"4694120","4698300"," If you don't know any better than it becomes acceptable, you think it's quality, right?"
"4698720","4702720"," You're like, this is a quality experience because that's what I was told when I was four, five,"
"4702800","4705400"," six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and now I'm 20 years old. "
"4706160","4708640"," And you think this is what good is, right?"
"4709020","4709900"," You think this is quality."
"4712700","4714260"," You know, it's bizarre."
"4714780","4720140"," So it's bizarre to watch take place with young people to think this is like quality. "
"4720540","4722600"," And this is all aspects of their lives."
"4724240","4726060"," You know, I was looking at some houses."
"4726060","4729500"," They had a bunch of houses for a year for sale for a quarter million dollars. "
"4729620","4733020"," They were basically shotgun-looking houses."
"4733720","4735320"," Like you'd find in New Orleans."
"4735320","4737220"," If you have any of you guys know what a shotgun house is?"
"4737780","4742120"," But these are like shotgun houses, new constructions, prefab, for sale for $250,000. "
"4742820","4744460"," And I was like, fuck me."
"4744840","4748120"," I was like, that's what's a house is going for right now."
"4748120","4752960"," A shitty, a shitty, a shitty shotgun house. "
"4753380","4759020"," These things were bizarre too, very thin and then deep set back and in the back of their lots."
"4759380","4760320"," I'll try to bring that up too."
"4769560","4770320"," Yeah, best deals. "
"4773760","4779000"," Yeah, I think it's a, I think it's accepting a lower quality of life and being told it's quality"
"4779000","4779600"," long enough."
"4779600","4783760"," You believe it or you have no other experience of having a quality life."
"4783820","4785580"," So this is what quality is. "
"4785840","4786800"," You see it in construction."
"4786820","4787780"," I see it in construction."
"4788620","4789320"," I see it in flips. "
"4789380","4793500"," I see it in the quality of build quality out there."
"4793560","4794240"," Stuff like that."
"4794460","4795960"," Rehab quality is even new construction. "
"4797040","4798060"," I see that a lot of it."
"4798120","4799300"," Matter of fact, they could show you guys something."
"4799720","4800740"," They got something cool for you guys. "
"4801680","4803060"," You guys want to follow this guy."
"4803220","4803580"," Hold on here."
"4806620","4807460"," Let me see here. "
"4809140","4810880"," You guys want to see how that like you."
"4810880","4812200"," The inshitification."
"4812800","4814120"," This stuff's going to haunt us. "
"4814760","4817260"," Not now, but this shit is going to haunt us someday."
"4817580","4818500"," Hold on a second here."
"4831070","4831910"," Give me a second here. "
"4832970","4834610"," Go check this guy out."
"4836590","4838750"," So here, I'll post this for you."
"4839210","4840790"," I want you guys to check this guy out. "
"4841870","4845990"," When you have time, check this guy's channel out."
"4847210","4848850"," Go down the rabbit hole with this guy."
"4851470","4852750"," Yeah, I mean, I get it. "
"4852930","4854130"," You don't mind self-checking."
"4854150","4855010"," I understand that."
"4855450","4857690"," I understand that you don't mind self-checkout. "
"4857850","4859510"," So I got David saying, I love self-checkouts."
"4859510","4860730"," I love self-checkouts."
"4860910","4862710"," Not mind not seeing those unmotivated people. "
"4863550","4865330"," But was it always like that though, David?"
"4865730","4867650"," Was it always unmotivated people?"
"4868330","4869290"," I know it's like that."
"4869550","4870950"," I think we went through the stages of it."
"4871890","4873590"," But I don't think it was always like that. "
"4873770","4874890"," I'm not saying like five years."
"4875070","4878150"," I'm talking about the course of 20, 20, 30, 40 years."
"4882380","4884340"," Yeah, so David saying unmotivated people. "
"4884460","4886540"," David, I think that was a part of the process, right?"
"4887540","4893640"," You end up getting people that like lowest common denominator and workers too, right?"
"4896140","4897860"," Like it's just a part of the whole process."
"4898120","4899360"," Same as like pumping your own gas."
"4903360","4907480"," Yeah, David, my experience in your service was like horrible, man. "
"4908040","4908780"," Fucking horrible."
"4910940","4918940"," In the US, David, they're telling people, so in the US, service workers are like, stop the tip"
"4918940","4920140"," culture in the United States."
"4920760","4922520"," And I'm like, that sounds great on paper. "
"4923580","4931160"," But I'm going to tell you that when you find out what happens, what happens is you can kiss off,"
"4931340","4932080"," you can kiss service."
"4933740","4936600"," I'm like, I'm assuming the people that are screaming for them have never traveled."
"4938520","4941880"," The service can really suck when you get away with tip cults. "
"4941940","4945340"," The moment you get away with tip culture, your service goes down the shitter."
"4946520","4948380"," Whether that's good or bad, I don't know."
"4949120","4950700"," But I know I love good service. "
"4950880","4951980"," I love tipping for good service."
"4952280","4953200"," I fucking love it."
"4953660","4955100"," And I love paying for it too. "
"4955620","4956420"," I'll be honest with you."
"4956460","4957860"," I have no problem paying for good service."
"4959700","4963320"," But you do away with like tipping culture and restaurants and shit in this country. "
"4964000","4968920"," You are going to see the lowest common denominator person taking your order."
"4969680","4970240"," Guaranteed."
"4973800","4974360"," Guaranteed. "
"4977270","4977730"," Yeah."
"4978110","4980770"," So I have a history in restaurants."
"4981690","4983090"," I have a background in restaurants. "
"4983810","4986110"," And you could weed people out."
"4986470","4987850"," Like you have people that don't make good money."
"4988090","4992270"," There's people that are service that service industry, people that should get in the hourly wage. "
"4992270","4997210"," But there's a whole other segment to the service industry that is very high caliber."
"4997610","4999410"," And it's like a dog eat dog."
"4999950","5000330"," Shark. "
"5000650","5000910"," Swimming."
"5001210","5001350"," Eat."
"5001630","5001730"," Shark. "
"5001970","5002090"," World."
"5002770","5006990"," And the moment we do away with that system, you're going to find the higher end."
"5008070","5009050"," Restaurants will not. "
"5009870","5010930"," They won't survive."
"5011490","5012650"," Like oh, like they once did."
"5015810","5016250"," Yeah. "
"5016390","5017410"," We post this for you."
"5017550","5019230"," And we post this for you in YouTube."
"5019450","5020610"," You guys want to see some shit?"
"5022210","5023550"," Check this guy out. "
"5023810","5024450"," Gold Star."
"5024930","5027350"," Gold Star inspections is the name of the YouTube channel."
"5027930","5030170"," I've been following this guy for a while now. "
"5030890","5034730"," And this guy is showing how they're building houses right now."
"5034930","5036630"," It is a fucking disaster."
"5037570","5044630"," It is a, it is a, like I've seen, I've seen rehabs that I've seen rehabbers do this quality of"
"5044630","5044830"," work. "
"5045550","5048410"," That's the quality work of getting a new construction right now."
"5048410","5049790"," It is atrocious."
"5050450","5054150"," There is no way that these houses make it a hundred years. "
"5054250","5058890"," There is, these are, they're, they're building mobile homes right now for people across the United"
"5058890","5059410"," States."
"5059970","5063690"," And it is fucking wild what they're actually doing."
"5063890","5068910"," And this inspector is going around and showing you what you're paying for all the time. "
"5069050","5072850"," This guy's got videos coming out like every single day."
"5073390","5074630"," This isn't like a one off."
"5074870","5076250"," Like hey, I found one bad thing. "
"5076250","5078150"," This guy is like, you want to show you some shit?"
"5078590","5084490"," And he's showing you with a state of US new home construction in the US and it is out of"
"5084490","5085290"," control."
"5085870","5088230"," They're, they're, I own a bunch of old homes."
"5088890","5094310"," None of these homes are built like I've torn, I've torn, I've torn, I've torn old homes like"
"5094310","5095090"," century homes. "
"5095490","5097970"," I've taken them to the stud."
"5099010","5100430"," Literally to the stud."
"5100990","5106510"," And I am, my mind is blown at some of the construction practices going on in the US right now. "
"5107250","5108650"," Mind is blown right now."
"5110810","5113370"," The guy is in, I believe is in Houston right now."
"5113490","5114170"," I believe he's out of Houston. "
"5120650","5121710"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Miss."
"5121770","5121910"," Talk."
"5122070","5127030"," I think that there's a, I think too, Mr. Talking Monkey that there's like a, I think that for a"
"5127030","5131110"," lot of service stuff, yeah, if you want to get rid of tipping for like, you know, like going to"
"5131110","5134250"," like an Applebee's or something like that, I think that's fine. "
"5134810","5139110"," I think you're bottom of the barrel, which is most of your service staff, like the bottom 30%,"
"5139110","5142950"," bottom 50%, or if they don't, there's already some rule."
"5143110","5144590"," This is another thing with tipping culture."
"5145430","5149390"," There's already some rules in place right now. "
"5149950","5156610"," Like if you don't make the minimum wage in a week, the restaurant or hotel has to pay you that"
"5156610","5157590"," to get you to minimum wage."
"5158050","5160470"," So there's already that in place for workers."
"5160470","5163810"," They don't make $2 in whatever change they get paid right now. "
"5164070","5165570"," They have to make that minimum wage."
"5165570","5172090"," And that's how you get safety net those people that are, you know, like unemployable or not the"
"5172090","5173530"," cream of the crop and that kind of stuff."
"5174330","5177870"," So maybe they, maybe they increase the minimum wage for service workers, right?"
"5177970","5182230"," It would be the way to do it and keep the tipping culture for your best, your best workers. "
"5183330","5184370"," Because that does help."
"5184510","5185210"," It does weed out."
"5185750","5189350"," It's a way for you to get your to, you know, I believe in tipping. "
"5190090","5191390"," I like the tipping culture."
"5192530","5195230"," And personally, I won't fucking tip you if you fuck me."
"5195850","5201890"," And I went, I recently went to a restaurant that had a, I went to a restaurant that switched"
"5201890","5204750"," recently to mandatory 20%. "
"5205570","5208330"," And that service staff just said fuck off."
"5208750","5210250"," Like they were like, they come to your table now."
"5210330","5211290"," They're like, what do you want?"
"5211510","5212590"," If I miss anything, fuck you. "
"5212590","5213050"," I don't care."
"5213530","5215670"," Take your order and I'm out of here and you're not going to see me again."
"5216270","5217350"," And I'd be the same way. "
"5217430","5219470"," It turns into a numbers game, right?"
"5220290","5226470"," Get as money, asses in seats as a service staff and you get their initial order and you make your"
"5226470","5226690"," money."
"5226810","5229090"," You don't care if the restaurant's going to stay in business or not."
"5229750","5231870"," Just asses in seats and turn your tables. "
"5233770","5234930"," Very, very bizarre."
"5235910","5236830"," Come on, baby."
"5237190","5238710"," Start fucking printing me some money. "
"5239790","5242690"," Like seriously, print me some money."
"5251880","5253300"," Yeah, it'll devolve."
"5253620","5254940"," It'll have to devolve. "
"5255400","5256240"," It'll devolve."
"5256560","5257660"," I'm sure of it."
"5257840","5259720"," I'm pretty good with that business. "
"5259720","5262400"," I'm pretty, pretty keen into it."
"5262440","5264680"," I'm like, man, this is going to end bad."
"5265200","5268820"," Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. "
"5271120","5272880"," Come on, Prince for daddy."
"5274020","5276740"," Get up there and hit that red bar up on high up there, that big one."
"5277720","5279260"," Do me this one up here. "
"5280000","5281620"," Do me that bad boy right there, please."
"5287260","5289680"," That's right, burr."
"5291560","5293260"," Slap that ass parable, Tom. "
"5299920","5305500"," I got, oh, by the way, I had, I guess what I, I lost fucking, I want a second."
"5315610","5316330"," I don't know."
"5317010","5318850"," For some reason, I can't see it. "
"5319450","5320750"," Hold on a second here."
"5325880","5327880"," I can't, I can't add it all up."
"5327880","5332600"," So like fucking, or Wednesday or whatever, I had a call spreads. "
"5333220","5334720"," I ended up putting some call spreads on."
"5335380","5348590"," And I ended"
"5348590","5355150"," up, I ended up losing like fucking, I lost a two grand or three grand on Friday."
"5355890","5356670"," Was it Friday?"
"5356890","5359390"," I think Friday morning I bought some calls in the morning. "
"5359530","5362370"," I bought like the dip and they just fucking ground."
"5362590","5365450"," I got burned on Friday for like two or three thousand dollars."
"5365450","5372010"," I followed that call spread trade with just calls and I got torched on Friday. "
"5379530","5387240"," Yeah, Steve Martin in my blue heaven."
"5387480","5388300"," I love Steve Martin."
"5388300","5388620"," He's good. "
"5389520","5390980"," He's a good actor."
"5392540","5394360"," Then we don't get those actors anymore."
"5394620","5396640"," They were talking about putting Timothy Shyamalot. "
"5397060","5401940"," They want to put Timothy Shyamalot as the, as the lead actor of Willy Wonka."
"5402760","5405360"," And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?"
"5406060","5411960"," Was like, like this, like Gene Wilder as a physical comedian."
"5413300","5414600"," Oh, he's a physical comedian. "
"5414860","5417100"," He's one of the best physical comedians of that generation."
"5417900","5420040"," Like that's the caliber of actor that you needed."
"5420580","5423940"," And now you got like Timothy Shyamalot, I'm a ding dong. "
"5425380","5426800"," The kids like him."
"5427580","5428820"," Hold on a second here."
"5435000","5435840"," Woo hoo. "
"5436480","5437720"," Make daddy some money."
"5437740","5438560"," I'm taking the money and running."
"5448490","5450030"," Give me that money, baby. "
"5452310","5453850"," I just took the money there."
"5453930","5454530"," Just heads up."
"5454650","5455690"," See that yellow line up there?"
"5455810","5457090"," See that little tick mark up there?"
"5457710","5459510"," Remember that little tick mark I was showing you?"
"5460170","5461690"," That's this little shit down here. "
"5461750","5462230"," You see that?"
"5463690","5464630"," So right there."
"5464790","5464950"," Okay."
"5465810","5466810"," So right here. "
"5467070","5467170"," Bing."
"5467350","5467790"," Oh, wait a minute."
"5471680","5473040"," See how a little bad boy right?"
"5473040","5473560"," Hold on. "
"5473600","5474940"," So we'll just go to the goddamn chart."
"5474940","5475500"," Hold on here."
"5479640","5481020"," I'm making money, baby. "
"5481600","5484080"," So right here."
"5484440","5484800"," Bing."
"5485300","5485540"," Bing. "
"5485900","5485980"," Bing."
"5487620","5488540"," Now can we get over this?"
"5488820","5489480"," Sure we can get over that."
"5490320","5491000"," Look for that though. "
"5491140","5492320"," And then that maybe we can get that."
"5492540","5492640"," Okay."
"5493260","5495400"," So try to buy that right there if you can. "
"5496240","5497060"," Take the money and run."
"5497360","5498460"," Don't don't fuck with this."
"5498900","5501560"," If it goes back up here and does that, bullshit will take it. "
"5502460","5503560"," It's flat right now."
"5508790","5512430"," Fucking for such a shitty day on Friday with no participants in the marketplace."
"5513530","5514950"," Uh, today has been very fucking good. "
"5515150","5519220"," So back to happy again."
"5522100","5523000"," Take the money."
"5523660","5528700"," That is financial advice. "
"5532880","5536980"," We'll see if we can creepy crawly over this and grab some, grab some more upside here."
"5544570","5545650"," I'm fucking terrible."
"5548430","5551610"," Where's the, uh, why is the, uh, there it goes right there. "
"5553800","5561110"," The upside target for you again is four, five, four, five, six, eight, seven, three or something"
"5561110","5561450"," like that."
"5561950","5562630"," Here's SPX."
"5563450","5565130"," Here's your upside target right here. "
"5573240","5574500"," I'm probably going to enter again here."
"5574640","5574860"," Hold on."
"5577490","5578790"," Hold on boys and girls. "
"5581380","5583020"," This is about to fucking crater here."
"5586460","5587340"," Apple boom."
"5593830","5597270"," Test is, uh, uh, VIX is about to get annihilated. "
"5603160","5603900"," Hold on here."
"5606540","5606940"," Okay."
"5607200","5610240"," So I'll let you guys know some setup right now on four, five, six. "
"5610840","5613320"," Uh, they're currently trading 13 cents."
"5614280","5616800"," Uh, I haven't bought them yet, but I'm going to be looking to buy them."
"5616800","5618920"," So this right here is what I'm looking to buy. "
"5619520","5620680"," We're going to buy that."
"5621740","5622100"," And this."
"5625320","5627440"," So I'll see if we can buy some of this down here. "
"5636320","5638060"," Oh, they just got me for two pennies."
"5638140","5639100"," It was at 13 cents."
"5639280","5640000"," They got me for 15. "
"5645460","5651220"," See if we can catch a, uh, even catch another, another squeeze higher here."
"5654080","5656020"," They caught me, they caught me for a minute here."
"5656080","5656920"," It wasn't paying attention. "
"5658980","5662620"," They may be paying extra two pennies and probably going to have to pay by more down here."
"5662620","5662940"," So."
"5673300","5679120"," Nope, I can't get out of that trade. "
"5680020","5682320"," I'm going to buy more."
"5689000","5694690"," Right, I'm going to be happier now."
"5694770","5695070"," I'm happier. "
"5710180","5712000"," I'm buying a dip down here right now."
"5728000","5733340"," Yeah, I'd like to see like, I'd like to see Walker become, um, I'd like, I'd really like to see"
"5733340","5735240"," Walker done by."
"5737180","5747000"," Yes, they, they're like the enshinification of, of movie making and, um, like, it's like, you don't"
"5747000","5749240"," have, uh, you don't have a physical community. "
"5749240","5754000"," It's like, like an icon of this."
"5754160","5756080"," You know, it'd be, you'd make a kick ass."
"5756900","5758020"," You'd make a kick ass. "
"5758160","5758640"," Willy Wonka."
"5759040","5760800"," If you could reign him in a little bit."
"5761480","5764000"," Uh, who's the guy that did, he's old now too. "
"5764240","5768820"," The guy that did, um, Jim Carrey might be a contender."
"5769280","5773000"," He might be like, he'd be in the top 10 per people I'd be calling."
"5774120","5776940"," Uh, who else a physical community could be a woman too. "
"5776940","5781920"," I don't even take a woman as, uh, as a Willy Wonka, but she would have to be really fucking"
"5781920","5782120"," good."
"5782380","5788780"," Like, uh, trying to, trying to think of like, um, some of the female comedians from SNL that could"
"5788780","5789940"," do a kick ass job attitude."
"5790260","5796100"," But the point being would be you'd need an icon from, in my, in my, in my, in my, you"
"5796100","5800260"," know, in my mind, I think you'd need an icon of, uh, of comedy and someone that's physical. "
"5801000","5804020"," Uh, I watched the new, uh, history of the world recently."
"5805480","5808820"," And wow, that fucking TV show sucked."
"5809180","5814660"," Like, I know that Mel Brooks was still involved, but I'm like, man, I'm like. "
"5819840","5823840"," And do like history of the world, the, the new history of the world, what, how about a wasted"
"5823840","5824360"," opportunity?"
"5824900","5828540"," Uh, for social commentary today."
"5829360","5831200"," It'd be a great, great opportunity."
"5837420","5845040"," Yeah, it was, it was very, um, it was, it was very, um, adult or it was very, um, I"
"5845040","5849320"," don't know if it was adult, it was very, it was adult and kid oriented, but it did leave you"
"5849320","5849700"," as a kid. "
"5849780","5855880"," When I remember watching it as a kid that I loved watching that movie, but I was like, can't trust"
"5855880","5856380"," that guy."
"5856640","5857480"," I was like, that guy's crazy."
"5864140","5865580"," Going on poke juice box. "
"5870030","5871490"," Yeah, I don't think it matters."
"5871810","5872690"," Uh, sex matters."
"5872810","5878730"," I think what matters is that like, how good of a comedian are they like, they, they that good. "
"5879630","5882470"," Uh, they have to be that good, but that's like an iconic role."
"5882490","5888010"," And it's, it's something that's probably going to take all of their effort, uh, to portray"
"5888010","5888890"," properly."
"5891050","5892510"," Um, you know, they just don't do that. "
"5892510","5892970"," They don't do that anymore."
"5893250","5893370"," Right?"
"5893790","5895010"," They don't do that at all."
"5896150","5897310"," There's none of that going on. "
"5898230","5900510"," So I'm sitting down here just bought some calls again."
"5900870","5903070"," So we'll see if we can catch that ride up right there."
"5903830","5905730"," And, uh, we'll see if we can catch this. "
"5905770","5908770"," If it starts to come down on me the wrong way, I'll cut them loose."
"5911070","5913070"," See if we can ping it one more time up there."
"5918340","5927360"," Hey, what's going on?"
"5928000","5928680"," How you doing, brother?"
"5928980","5929320"," Good to see you. "
"5929480","5930360"," Happy, happy Thanksgiving, everybody."
"5931840","5936100"," Now, let me see if you can find that thing about, uh, the cease fire being an actual truth."
"5936760","5937040"," Hold on here. "
"5937120","5938100"," I'm just going to have to find that for you."
"5940200","5940900"," Yeah, I don't know."
"5941160","5946000"," So someone just said in the chat, they said, um, someone just said in the chat that women aren't"
"5946000","5946260"," funny. "
"5946960","5949600"," I'll tell you what, you know, the problem is not that women aren't funny."
"5950040","5954180"," It's that they're, they're not writing roles, uh, or they're writing."
"5954180","5962080"," So Hollywood, they're doing is, uh, they're not writing roles, not, not, uh, for everyone. "
"5962400","5966220"," They're writing a role going, oh, this is a, this is a, I don't know, a white male."
"5966400","5968180"," We're going to write a role for a white male."
"5968480","5970120"," Oh, this is a black male. "
"5970380","5975400"," We're going to write a role for a black male with our interpretation of that is rather than writing"
"5975400","5981720"," a fucking role for a hero and just giving it to whomever is the best actor, right?"
"5983020","5984500"," Um, that's not happening."
"5984920","5989180"," Uh, so there's like, it's like an underhanded racism, underhanded sexism."
"5990240","5995820"," Um, so rather than giving that role to somebody, that's a big major problem right now in Hollywood. "
"5996320","5998860"," Uh, and it's all about box offers money too, right?"
"5999020","6000280"," We put Timothy Shum a lot in there."
"6000580","6001440"," Shum a lot of ding dong."
"6001560","6002880"," We're going to get a bunch of fucking kids. "
"6003020","6003720"," They're going to watch this."
"6004320","6006220"," He's popular right now, right?"
"6006780","6010880"," So it's like this stupidity from Hollywood just to make a buck."
"6010880","6012020"," I'm going to get there to make a buck. "
"6012460","6017240"," But at the same time you want to put, uh, the person that's going to perform that role best in"
"6017240","6017740"," my view."
"6018680","6021000"," So, uh, it's kind of a problem, right?"
"6021220","6022000"," They don't do that anymore."
"6022280","6027500"," They're like, Hollywood is like, it's like, first of all, you got a problem with right, not all bad"
"6027500","6029000"," writers, but a lot of bad writers. "
"6029200","6033880"," Then you get AI coming into it, writing shit scripts, and it's all about just money, right?"
"6034000","6035880"," It's just, it's just devolved into money."
"6036440","6043380"," But like, instead of writing a role for a specific person in mind, it's very, it goes back to that"
"6043380","6044400"," alien thing, right?"
"6044700","6046340"," They wrote a role for a fucking hero."
"6046380","6048280"," It didn't matter who the person was. "
"6048820","6052800"," They ended up giving it to, um, um, to what's their name."
"6053320","6054960"," And she fucking played that role, kick ass."
"6055140","6057360"," She was kick ass in that role, kick ass. "
"6062500","6065120"," You know, it's, it's, it's fucking stupid."
"6065120","6071700"," It's like, uh, like Ripley could have, Ripley Kate, like Ripley and Alien was a written role with"
"6071700","6074820"," no, um, no one in mind, right?"
"6075080","6076240"," Anyone could have played that role."
"6076720","6079940"," Anyone could have played that fucking role, and they would have been awesome at it. "
"6080260","6085640"," Uh, so a lot of that stuff has to do with, um, with just, with just like saying, you know"
"6085640","6088940"," what, if, uh, Sigourney Weaver's going to play it, we got to make it a woman's role."
"6089240","6091260"," They're saying they didn't do that with that movie."
"6091260","6093260"," And, uh, oh yeah, baby. "
"6093560","6095060"," Oh yeah, fuck yeah, squeeze it."
"6095320","6096380"," Fucking squeeze it."
"6097100","6098840"," Put that pain train on these bears. "
"6105440","6106860"," Oh yeah, squeeze them bears."
"6112920","6115500"," Yeah, the state of movies, man."
"6115980","6125300"," No, I hope, I'm hoping that, um, there's some good films out there to share, but, uh,"
"6125980","6128060"," yeah, yeah. "
"6128060","6128420"," Yeah."
"6132860","6134480"," This is day trading shit."
"6136440","6136920"," Squeeze them. "
"6137560","6138660"," Let that money, baby."
"6138880","6140420"," Give me that four trigger cluster right there."
"6140620","6141380"," One, two, three, four. "
"6142280","6142620"," Squeeze."
"6142700","6143380"," We need, we need all these."
"6143520","6145720"," We need, actually, we need more put buyers so we can go up higher. "
"6147540","6147820"," We need more."
"6147960","6149300"," Just keep buying puts, baby."
"6149460","6150080"," Keep buying puts. "
"6151560","6153360"," Let's even find this news article for you."
"6160300","6161200"," Come on."
"6161260","6162240"," Give me some more pennies. "
"6163600","6165100"," Fourteen fucking cents."
"6165440","6165740"," That's it."
"6168080","6169480"," Come on now. "
"6173580","6176560"," Print me some fucking goddamn, I'll go stop swearing."
"6178680","6179680"," I'm swearing."
"6183840","6184680"," Squeeze it. "
"6188440","6189980"," No, fifteen cents."
"6191480","6192820"," It was down eleven, so."
"6211100","6214740"," The Vicks trying to fight its way back before a rolling over here. "
"6218700","6222080"," Watch out for, uh, there was some danger here for a role, so be careful."
"6222960","6227620"," If you guys watch Vicks on a one minute, it could be a trap."
"6235830","6236490"," Watch out. "
"6236650","6238590"," Watch the Vicks in the background at home here."
"6239830","6241790"," I got my finger on the, on the cell, so."
"6241790","6246040"," So, I want to see Vix get rejected here. "
"6247960","6250120"," Come on, squeeze it up just a little bit too."
"6250280","6251520"," Give me like one more green bar."
"6270180","6271820"," I want to see Vix get rejected here. "
"6274210","6278610"," Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope."
"6281430","6283310"," I'm gonna put a stop on this, hold on."
"6294280","6297540"," I got a stop on 11 on 4.56, so we'll see. "
"6298720","6299680"," I don't want to be upside down today."
"6309610","6315290"," There's now 321,000 puts on 4.54, oof."
"6316330","6318070"," They're getting smoked right now. "
"6330950","6335130"," Yeah, there's a, there's a, like they're just, they're just like loading up on puts today."
"6336090","6337210"," Let me see if I find this really quick."
"6340380","6346900"," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. "
"6346900","6347600"," I'm trying to find this here."
"6347700","6352320"," The Secretary's in P.S. says the U.S. is seeing lower prices on items from fuel to food."
"6355820","6358980"," They had something to do with Hamas. "
"6362820","6365760"," The rocket, had something with the rocket attack on the hospital."
"6368140","6370540"," Let me see, let me see if I can type this in here and find it."
"6377420","6382840"," So there was a guy that was a, he's like a minister for Hamas. "
"6387200","6389440"," He's like a minister for Hamas, right?"
"6391720","6393200"," And I think this was it."
"6393480","6394660"," I think this was it right here."
"6394820","6395560"," Hold on, let me see if this is it. "
"6395780","6396160"," See if I got it."
"6396880","6398560"," It's kind of fucking bad shit crazy stuff."
"6399620","6400280"," Hold on here. "
"6419750","6420850"," Hold on a second here."
"6426880","6431440"," Yeah, this Hamas official was asked to hold off on real."
"6431740","6436020"," Now let's start with, I don't fucking trust anybody from Hamas at all. "
"6436500","6439660"," I believe in if you believe Palestinians, I do too."
"6440060","6440740"," I live in Michigan."
"6441020","6447400"," They have a lot of Palestinians that live here in Michigan and they have a very colorful, happy"
"6447400","6447640"," life. "
"6447880","6449200"," There's no car bombs in Detroit."
"6449900","6451520"," There's nothing bad happening in Detroit."
"6451520","6453300"," People are living their lives, good lives. "
"6453960","6455080"," So do they have a good life?"
"6455320","6456900"," Yeah, I think they should be able to live a good life."
"6457020","6457480"," Peaceful life."
"6458500","6465220"," But there's a Hamas official that said we were holding off on this information because of not a"
"6465220","6473360"," ceasefire for a small amount of time, but a cessation of all fighting. "
"6475100","6477120"," So he let that slip in this article."
"6477120","6478540"," I'm trying to find it for you right now."
"6478640","6480020"," I'm reading through it and I'm not finding it. "
"6483980","6485540"," Now, do you trust anybody from Hamas?"
"6485940","6491220"," Fuck no, but I thought it was interesting that this guy let it slip that this could be a ceasefire"
"6491220","6493940"," that's more permanent than non-permanent."
"6494120","6497740"," Do any of you guys think that there's a permanent ceasefire coming or do you think this is only"
"6497740","6502420"," going to last for as long as they give hostages back?"
"6502680","6504220"," Let me ask you that in the chat if you think that's gonna happen."
"6512670","6514390"," Any opinion on gold and silver?"
"6515730","6517030"," We can talk about that if you want. "
"6520690","6521530"," Come on, dude."
"6521710","6527650"," Just squeeze this shit, come on."
"6536020","6538220"," Train pod podcasting, we got another auction of one. "
"6538620","6544880"," We got one already at 11.30. Sigourney Weaver was an early awakening as a young lad."
"6545080","6546040"," She's smoking hot, man."
"6546940","6547760"," Smoking hot. "
"6549180","6554080"," When I was a kid, I was in that t-shirt and that underwear and I was like, I was"
"6554080","6555440"," like, she could be my loop skywalker."
"6557000","6558420"," I thought she was hot."
"6566900","6568900"," I'm listening to McCarthy, I don't know much about her. "
"6570240","6573560"," I'm trying to think of, let me see here."
"6573920","6581810"," I'm starting to go to some of the female comedians that I like to look some up right now."
"6582430","6583210"," Tina Fey, love her. "
"6584850","6586230"," What else else I really like?"
"6586570","6588190"," I can't believe, is Carol Bennett still alive?"
"6588470","6589150"," I like Kate McKinnon."
"6590890","6592250"," Is Joan River still alive?"
"6593470","6594850"," She's still alive or no?"
"6595350","6596910"," I'm reading through like a list right now."
"6597510","6601170"," Kristin Wigas-Hilarious, who else do I like?"
"6602370","6606830"," Amy Poehler-Hilarious, Wanda Sykes, she's awesome. "
"6607990","6610290"," I don't know, there's a bunch of people I like."
"6624200","6628700"," Sad that our troops get bombed by Iran-backed militias."
"6630000","6638940"," I don't know, I would fucking love, I was thinking about that too, I was like, you can imagine"
"6638940","6647760"," going on a tour right now in Iraq and you've got like kick ass air support and some little dweeb"
"6647760","6648600"," wants to fuck around. "
"6649220","6653020"," It's like a great way to get a big combat badge."
"6654600","6656140"," I was in the army, so."
"6659000","6662260"," Come on now, stop with this prancing around shit. "
"6666390","6668190"," Yeah, she dead now, she's dead, huh?"
"6680390","6683970"," I'd say the one thing I'm scared, if I had to be scared of anybody, I'm not scared of Iran,"
"6683970","6685270"," I'm more scared of China."
"6685950","6690690"," I'm not scared, I'm not really scared of China either, but I'm more scared of young people having"
"6690690","6692070"," to go fight that war for us."
"6692370","6698710"," I got one more prayer, they're gonna stop me out. "
"6699510","6700170"," There we go."
"6701090","6703110"," I got my stops, should I buy again?"
"6715080","6717620"," Or do I go with the 455s maybe this time?"
"6717820","6719340"," They just broke down to 41 cents."
"6723580","6728580"," There's a little bit of a gap left on HYG to close, but not much, Dixie's still rolling over and"
"6728580","6728820"," down. "
"6729320","6733900"," Dixie actually has a cross right now on its daily."
"6735040","6745280"," So the Dixie, if you watch the daily chart on Dixie, there's a major, major cross coming to"
"6745280","6747340"," blast Dixie down to the depths of hell."
"6747660","6749300"," Now's that pulling over for a little bit. "
"6750040","6751920"," It's parked on 16,000."
"6752180","6753540"," Tesla's just doing its thing."
"6754600","6756260"," Apple just doing its thing up there. "
"6758040","6761360"," Nice day on Apple, Vix just parked right now."
"6761900","6766820"," Vix now breaking above, it's a, it's 27 EMA and a one minute timeframe here."
"6769540","6771980"," I'm just, I'm just sitting here right now, I'm not doing anything. "
"6778240","6780800"," Let's take a look at the half bar bar here and see what this is saying."
"6783880","6785160"," Yeah, it's looking bullish still."
"6785840","6786820"," This is all looking bullish. "
"6799990","6801050"," Right, I'm back in again."
"6809880","6812240"," I wish I'd grabbed that whole bar right there."
"6817120","6818980"," Yeah, what's the deal with Dolly Parton?"
"6819120","6821440"," So I saw the picture of her dressed up. "
"6822060","6823740"," She's a great comedian by the way, I like her."
"6823900","6826260"," I actually like her all around, I like her."
"6827060","6829560"," I love Dolly Parton and it was weird too. "
"6829700","6830660"," I didn't like as a kid."
"6831160","6836220"," I didn't know like a kind of knew she was, but now as an adult knowing everything that she's done"
"6836220","6838280"," for people, she doesn't."
"6838460","6840040"," I don't, there was controversy too. "
"6840140","6841960"," What was that controversy if you don't mind my ask?"
"6841960","6842720"," And I didn't see it."
"6843860","6845000"," I heard there was controversy."
"6846000","6847900"," I don't know what that would, I didn't look it up. "
"6848220","6852020"," All I saw was a picture and I thought she looked fucking great."
"6852520","6857820"," By the way, I thought she looked outstanding and smoking hot and, but I don't know what the"
"6857820","6858620"," controversy was."
"6858920","6859780"," What was the controversy?"
"6867980","6871420"," Trade podcasts, suggestions on educational videos. "
"6873020","6874960"," Here you got there, portfolio management."
"6878520","6884620"," Re-bouncing, that's all good for end of year, especially into spring and, she's too old to dress"
"6884620","6885060"," like that."
"6885300","6885800"," Fuck no. "
"6887180","6888360"," Really, that was the controversy?"
"6889120","6889780"," I thought she looked great."
"6890720","6893000"," All right, dude, she's got it, flaunted baby."
"6893960","6894920"," What do you guys think?"
"6895180","6897000"," Was that Dolly Parton shouldn't have dressed like that?"
"6897980","6899480"," From what I saw, she looked great to me. "
"6902400","6903120"," Just the outfit, huh?"
"6907680","6909020"," Oh, Rebecca de Mornay is hot."
"6909380","6910220"," She's super hot too."
"6913540","6915940"," Oh, they're trying to catch me in here. "
"6917100","6918680"," I'm upside down right now, boys."
"6920700","6922420"," Oh, there goes Vix's on the move again."
"6922540","6923640"," They're gonna try to throw me over here. "
"6923760","6929520"," Hold on, we got a new half hour starting here."
"6929560","6930040"," We got 10 more."
"6930520","6932460"," Oh, they got, they got nine minutes to get a new low here. "
"6932980","6935120"," These fucking bears are gonna try to make this bar red."
"6940700","6943560"," And as they're pulling back right now, Vix bottoming."
"6944040","6945740"," Vix breaking above it's 27 EMA. "
"6946100","6946920"," I'm gonna get caught in this."
"6947040","6948420"," I'm probably gonna cut this loose here in a second."
"6954150","6955930"," Ooh, I almost had another buy in there. "
"6969780","6970860"," Show this over here."
"6974340","6979240"," I bought a bot, I bought like right here, I bought that bar right there."
"6979900","6980480"," That's where I bought. "
"6982880","6984000"," They're catching me in this."
"6984120","6985600"," We catch one more green bar up here."
"6985720","6990420"," I'm gonna try to get myself out of this right now if I can. "
"6992480","6993400"," I'm gonna roll this."
"7009870","7012610"," As Suzanne Summer's still alive, I thought she was dead too."
"7013030","7013850"," I always liked her too. "
"7014070","7015110"," I always liked Suzanne Summer's."
"7020160","7022220"," I don't know, I'm gonna make money all morning on the put-in call side."
"7023320","7027040"," I've been shaving like a five cents, 10 cents all more. "
"7027160","7028600"," I bought some puts earlier for 14."
"7028820","7029360"," They went to 30."
"7030000","7032220"," In like 15 minutes, it went to 30 cents. "
"7038340","7040100"," She's older than 70, isn't she?"
"7040380","7041660"," How old is Dolly Parton?"
"7042260","7044360"," I thought she was like 90 or something."
"7045820","7046680"," Hold on a second."
"7050300","7051300"," How old is she?"
"7051600","7053580"," So she's 77 years old. "
"7054440","7055940"," She can do her the fuck she wants at 77."
"7056920","7057620"," Looks great by the way."
"7060660","7064560"," No, they're gonna, they're gonna, they're gonna just leave them on their 10 cents right now. "
"7064580","7065440"," I'm down three pennies."
"7070300","7072080"," I don't know if I should leave them on or sell them."
"7072940","7074880"," You're gonna try to, they're gonna try to take me out here. "
"7075900","7076840"," Oh, and there we go."
"7076980","7078300"," There's one of those triggers right there."
"7078880","7080600"," You're gonna try to slam this right down. "
"7085560","7086780"," Let's bring that back here."
"7090940","7092720"," Yeah, she's 77 years old."
"7092960","7094080"," Yeah, it looks like a roll, doesn't it?"
"7095140","7096300"," I'm watching Vix right now. "
"7096380","7099100"," Vix is getting, Vix is getting beefy."
"7099700","7103080"," It's getting, they're trying to get that new low in the half hour here."
"7103740","7105900"," So 12.24, we got six minutes left. "
"7107180","7115130"," And the half hour started where, right there."
"7116270","7118670"," Here's where the half hour started right here."
"7119610","7127870"," So they're trying to keep us underneath this on the close of the half hour bar, about bar right"
"7127870","7128110"," now. "
"7128110","7130590"," They're trying to, they're trying to get us down."
"7131830","7133950"," So we'll pay attention to this right here."
"7134350","7136470"," This is the beginning of the half hour candle here. "
"7136630","7138670"," So there's a big fight right now between buyers and sellers."
"7139510","7141590"," We'll see if the sellers can do it or not."
"7143290","7146310"," We got six minutes left to get that new low on the half. "
"7146710","7148910"," If they get it, I'm gonna have to exit, get bearish."
"7151550","7154350"," Here is the previous half hour right here."
"7154730","7155510"," Don't know where it is. "
"7157030","7157970"," Right there."
"7159670","7163550"," I'll leave this, I'm gonna push this back a little bit so you can see exactly where it was."
"7164130","7165430"," It's right here. "
"7166450","7170670"," They're trying to keep us, they're trying to get that new low."
"7172670","7179250"," And these fucking bears, man, these selling sellers got nine cents right now."
"7185010","7187350"," This would be sellers winning the half hour here. "
"7188470","7190970"," If they get that close in the next five minutes."
"7202820","7206440"," Oh, Dolly Parton lives across the street from you, and she's one of the kind of humans in her met."
"7206640","7210200"," Yeah, the thing she's done for people is, you're gonna try to sell this, aren't they?"
"7216540","7221680"," The Dolly Parton, like the book stuff that she does, like she, like, she, like, if there is, people"
"7221680","7231300"," always ask about, like, Americans that are like, that are like, like who, like, what is it, Fred"
"7231300","7232380"," Rogers, is that his name?"
"7232520","7236900"," Who's the guy that was, the guy that was from like Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' neighborhood?"
"7237600","7238600"," She's probably it, right?"
"7238820","7244300"," She's probably like that version of, probably like someone that's alive today that's a lot like Mr."
"7244720","7247140"," Rogers' neighborhood, national treasure, exactly. "
"7248960","7255660"," And I always like how she, she gets, what's really weird is she gets thrown in, you know, like, we"
"7255660","7261400"," have a huge, we have a huge war going on in this country."
"7261680","7262640"," You probably have seen it."
"7264240","7268560"," Culture war going on in this country, like, it doesn't matter who you are, right?"
"7268980","7277960"," If you're a person of color, if you're gender or, I don't know, there's like a war, there's like a,"
"7278120","7282740"," there's a cultural war where they're trying to pick everybody into it, like, you have to pick a"
"7282740","7283100"," side. "
"7284380","7291940"," So did I notice that her specifically, often she gets dragged into that conversation, and she"
"7291940","7294460"," deftly side steps."
"7295000","7299820"," A lot of those, a lot of those, eight cents, seriously?"
"7304580","7306960"," The, he's fucking bears, man."
"7306960","7309000"," They don't ever give up. "
"7311000","7315180"," But she side steps a lot of controversy."
"7316160","7320080"," You know, it's not like, it's not like these news organizations care where she is."
"7320200","7322160"," They just want to catch, it's like the gotcha, right?"
"7322800","7326260"," Uh-huh, she said something so that 30% of people now hate her. "
"7326860","7330680"," And she does a really good job of side stepping."
"7331520","7332100"," Hold on a second here."
"7344180","7345480"," I'm buying some right now. "
"7345560","7347240"," I just bought some for eight cents or nine cents."
"7347240","7349680"," I'm like, I'm like buying back in one more time."
"7349700","7350680"," So I don't lose any money. "
"7352060","7355640"," Um, she's like side steps, like everything's a gotcha now, right?"
"7355880","7357460"," It's like everything is like, it doesn't matter who you are."
"7357520","7360900"," It's like a gotcha like, ah, they're in the wrong side of this or then the wrong side of that"
"7360900","7361260"," or."
"7362880","7363360"," That's good. "
"7363420","7364000"," I'm doing good again."

"11580940","11586140"," not every time i say every time it's like 80 percent of the time we fucking time they cut those"
"11586140","11593360"," rates dude they front run that shit like one to one to two to three months in advance and uh"
"11593360","11597500"," i'm on i'm on that trade with you i'm like i'm bullish on that where we're going uh super bold"
"11597500","11606080"," man but my point there stands that where's where's the get by uh right now my thought on that dip"
"11606080","11614360"," by oh with that mouth he's gonna show it to you guys i've shown it on the stream in the"
"11614360","11622200"," past but i'm gonna let's go to spx let's go to uh one year i gotta do a whole another"
"11622200","11635720"," show on this here's"
"11635720","11645320"," spx right here the one fly in the ointment on this like in terms of accumulation"
"11645320","11656220"," distribution um my one caveat here is i think i personally i'd really like to see this"
"11656220","11663860"," the new all-time high and then the touch and go we just keep going right up that way we"
"11663860","11671380"," just check that level maybe it's like right down here touch and go and we're off and run right"
"11671380","11678060"," there that's what i'd like to see uh but if we start cutting rates because you broke something i"
"11678060","11684940"," want to be clear on this okay but that doesn't fucking like you they don't care about you uh their"
"11684940","11692980"," job isn't to suck you off or anything like that um so this likely means they broke something so you"
"11692980","11698900"," get up here and we come back down and check this stuff so uh if we're if we were in"
"11698900","11704060"," the right part of the business cycle i'd say is a better chance of us doing this than moving on"
"11704940","11713360"," but we get into when we get into uh next year uh i think you see a low down here"
"11714140","11722020"," in like february i think you see this low in february let's pretend that's february i know that's"
"11722020","11728660"," it says april uh but i let's say let me just clean it up then fuck it let's make it"
"11728660","11735420"," more exacting i think in february you see like a blast down here and i think you get the squeeze"
"11735420","11742540"," back up and you get sent down one more time uh even lower and this is my big fears that"
"11742540","11751620"," we come into something like this we actually recheck the actual low the only reason i think this is"
"11751620","11763160"," possible is due to the mechanics on a macro basis uh"
"11763160","11769540"," that we can go we can go much lower i don't think we're going lower than 3500 but i think"
"11769540","11777420"," that that is still on the table for next year um at some point it's still the door that is"
"11777420","11782060"," there still open the door has been kicked shut on it yet if you want to kick the door shut"
"11782060","11787440"," on that and say we're not we're never going back down there then you you we need to do this"
"11787440","11796740"," right and in start i said that i said this one but i meant this one up here"
"11796740","11804680"," sorry i haven't missed over here so this one is what i'm talking about uh i think you see that"
"11804680","11809280"," there's a good possibility of seeing that but i think you come back down here you do that one then"
"11809280","11813920"," you're going to do that one over there uh now this previous high right here if you want to say"
"11813920","11819460"," we're never coming back you want to see us do this and keep moving if you did that right there"
"11819460","11823940"," i would i would be on board with you i would say that ain't none of that's happening but until"
"11823940","11830860"," that happens till that happens uh we're we're never looking back uh the door is wide open for that"
"11830860","11837560"," for that major low so even if we went to 5100 by december i don't think it's even out of"
"11837560","11843220"," the i don't think it's out of um the real possibility of having that happen in any way shape or"
"11843220","11853000"," form uh we i got to do this show with you guys because i got to do this show with"
"11853000","11860440"," you guys because i got to show you the data on this like how many times does this happen um"
"11860440","11866820"," like when they start cutting rates there's only three example i think there's i think there's only"
"11866820","11873200"," three examples from the beginning of our stock market three or four i think we've had three or four"
"11873200","11879560"," examples of soft landings uh but then like in between each one of those there's like three to four"
"11879560","11887900"," times where it's not a soft landing and those make up the majority of um what happens so like"
"11887900","11897600"," the key"
"11897600","11905980"," point on uh no rechecking of major lows history is against you it's possible but history is against"
"11905980","11915950"," you is my only point it's not that it can't we get a little bit of a roll coming up"
"11915950","11925210"," here it's not that we can't it's that the the the law of probabilities in previous examples says"
"11925210","11930430"," that there's a high probability that we're going to roll pretty hard and heavy whenever they pop"
"11930430","11938930"," whenever they're not going to raise rates anymore shut the door yeah you want to see if you if"
"11938930","11943190"," you're one of those shut the door people if you're one of those shut the door people you want to"
"11943190","11952590"," see a new high from above the high of January 2022 you want to see a back test and then"
"11952590","11959030"," we keep moving up if you see that i would be with you saying that you're right we got the"
"11959030","11965230"," soft landing we're out of here we're never going back there ever again um but historically it's not"
"11965230","11971530"," on your there is some part of this historicalness that is on your side though um for every soft"
"11971530","11979310"," landing that we have we have um three to four real recessions so you'll get like a soft landing"
"11979310","11983870"," then three to four recessions then a soft landing then three or four recessions then a soft landing"
"11983870","11990070"," or something like that uh and we are like the third or fourth recession we haven't had a soft"
"11990070","11996770"," landing since i believe the early 90s um spend some time spend almost fucking 30 years that we've"
"11996770","12001430"," had a soft since we've had a soft landing so it's possible we could get a soft landing uh"
"12001430","12011100"," statistically it's possible yeah dude bear town sheriff this is killing me man uh this is killing"
"12011100","12019420"," me this this whole action here reminds me of this nonsense right and a day right buyer's market no"
"12019420","12028010"," volatility market come down there and then you get it at the end of the day or even tomorrow should"

"19420810","19424450"," just the problem is like i'm looking at weekly puts here, right?"
"19425730","19432650"," And I don't see us going down any deeper than like 452 450 so like I looked at friday puts"
