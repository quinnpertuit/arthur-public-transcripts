"RsCujrLQU3E","0","8640"," Good morning traders, this is your daily brief with Captain Jim James."
"RsCujrLQU3E","8640","13580"," I did post the daily brief that was comprehensive this morning on Twitter."
"RsCujrLQU3E","13580","20760"," This would be a companion piece so that you can understand what I'm putting out there"
"RsCujrLQU3E","20760","27560"," and also learn how to basically do your own daily brief, your own trading plan for the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","27560","34520"," week and also for the month, for the year and every day."
"RsCujrLQU3E","34520","42680"," So you can always check back to compare notes or at least set up a charting system so that"
"RsCujrLQU3E","42680","49040"," you can chart for yourself if I don't post one or I disappear one day, you at least have"
"RsCujrLQU3E","49040","56240"," this information and you can also base it off what other people say when you are watching"
"RsCujrLQU3E","56280","62080"," a YouTube channel or watching posts on Twitter, you want to be able to have a baseline for"
"RsCujrLQU3E","62080","70400"," what you think to compare to other people and not just trust people on the internet."
"RsCujrLQU3E","70400","78600"," So we are looking at the RUT but furthermore I'm looking at a trading view, I like to use"
"RsCujrLQU3E","78600","89600"," trading view for my research charting and then I carry it over to let's say Weebell."
"RsCujrLQU3E","89600","93920"," I also use other charting software but this one is free."
"RsCujrLQU3E","93920","102560"," What I like about trading view is that they carry more tickers unlike Weebell."
"RsCujrLQU3E","103560","109520"," What I like to do my research charting on the futures charts, you'll hear traders say"
"RsCujrLQU3E","109520","117120"," do traders say futures don't matter, that is incorrect, all of your research or my belief"
"RsCujrLQU3E","117120","123280"," is that my research begins in futures and then extends into the cash market."
"RsCujrLQU3E","123280","129040"," You can get a trading view account for free and we're going to chart out on a year, the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","129520","139920"," RUT, the Russell RTY, we're going to carry that over into a cash market for IWM and"
"RsCujrLQU3E","139920","147480"," I'm going to also show you the SPY which is ES or the ES Mini which you can also find"
"RsCujrLQU3E","147480","153840"," here in trading view and carry those charts over into a SPY chart."
"RsCujrLQU3E","154240","160960"," My only issue with using trading view during the cash session is that unless you pay for"
"RsCujrLQU3E","160960","167680"," an account the market data is delayed by 15 minutes and I know that the market data on"
"RsCujrLQU3E","167680","173680"," Weebell is live market data that's free."
"RsCujrLQU3E","173680","178840"," I'll do my research on these charts and then I'll carry these numbers over to Weebell and"
"RsCujrLQU3E","178840","183360"," it'll work for me and I can adjust them as the days progress throughout the course of"
"RsCujrLQU3E","183360","190640"," week so without further ado we're going to look at the Russell here and this is I believe"
"RsCujrLQU3E","190640","198080"," yeah this is a one-year chart and there's a few things I want to know when I'm setting"
"RsCujrLQU3E","198080","205120"," my major support and resistance lines and the first thing I'll check is a website called"
"RsCujrLQU3E","205120","211840"," the equityclock.com seasonality or a backslash seasonality and specifically if we're to look"
"RsCujrLQU3E","211840","219120"," at the major indexes sectors industries commodities what else I find neat about this"
"RsCujrLQU3E","219120","231360"," is we're coming into the end of the S&P 500 and it's neat how they write or May 5th"
"RsCujrLQU3E","231360","238080"," and then it begins again on October 28th and ends on May 5th and so what that's trying"
"RsCujrLQU3E","238080","244960"," to show you is this is when your start beginning to enter your positions is October 28th and"
"RsCujrLQU3E","244960","253200"," you're starting to wrap up your lungs beginning on May 5th although you'll see summer earnings"
"RsCujrLQU3E","253200","261520"," coming into July you would have positioned yourself believe it or not from October through"
"RsCujrLQU3E","261600","270320"," May leading into July so when we get to Apple being at 150 you had actually entered at some"
"RsCujrLQU3E","270320","278400"," point at 120 so keep that in mind and the same goes for the Russell so you'll notice that the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","278400","287440"," Russell is going to trail off a little bit later than the S&P 500 so I'm bearish or I should start"
"RsCujrLQU3E","287520","294480"," to become bearish on the Russell in the intermediate time frame long time frame but at the same time"
"RsCujrLQU3E","294480","301360"," I have to also look at a chart on a smaller level three month one month and a weekly chart"
"RsCujrLQU3E","301360","305600"," to see if there's any bullishness in that chart and so if you're if you're to look at the Russell"
"RsCujrLQU3E","305600","311680"," right now it's almost right there you can kind of see that there is this topping pattern"
"RsCujrLQU3E","312320","318720"," its trend is probably trending down overall to begin a new cycle into next year"
"RsCujrLQU3E","319840","324880"," but we do have a defined trading range here that you can see that's being respected"
"RsCujrLQU3E","324880","331360"," although at any time it might not be respected we're going to set a support line here at the bottom"
"RsCujrLQU3E","332720","338240"," we're going to change that to red so we know that's bad right we don't ever want to go below"
"RsCujrLQU3E","338240","344560"," this line the bears know that the bulls know that and we've got another respected line up here at"
"RsCujrLQU3E","344560","353760"," the top make that one green so we know that that's green to go you think above this line is bullish"
"RsCujrLQU3E","353760","360400"," okay on a one-year chart and I try to check if I'm playing the spy or if I'm playing the IWM"
"RsCujrLQU3E","360960","366720"," I'm focusing on that one ETF I will make sure to look at the one year the six month"
"RsCujrLQU3E","367520","373280"," the three month the one month the five day and the one day almost every day I try to check back on"
"RsCujrLQU3E","373280","379200"," it and especially when I don't know where we are in the charts sometimes when you scale back to"
"RsCujrLQU3E","379200","384720"," a macro level it'll give you a better perspective as to where we're going where we're headed"
"RsCujrLQU3E","386000","392160"," so here we go we've got those two lines set up here you know even right now on this chart it's"
"RsCujrLQU3E","392160","398880"," looking very bearish a larger time frame so we'll come down to a six-month chart"
"RsCujrLQU3E","402000","406240"," and we start to see that we're getting a little bit a little bit more information here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","407040","412000"," and you're going to see bearish resistance so I'm going to put in"
"RsCujrLQU3E","414960","420960"," trend line right here and it looks like this line has been been respected the entire time"
"RsCujrLQU3E","422640","428960"," as we come down you can see that here now if you were a bear"
"RsCujrLQU3E","431280","435600"," you would play every one of these rips down every time it touches this line you play this down"
"RsCujrLQU3E","436240","443680"," play this down play this down play this down now the reason for pausing at this point in this"
"RsCujrLQU3E","443680","447520"," chart if you were a bear would be you didn't get continuation"
"RsCujrLQU3E","447680","456240"," down through this major support you didn't even test it right here there was a moment where"
"RsCujrLQU3E","456880","463440"," buyers stepped in and then they also stepped in with you playing the market every day you know"
"RsCujrLQU3E","465040","471360"," that on the 19th somewhere in there it did tag down here on the 19th"
"RsCujrLQU3E","472000","483280"," and then you notice that excuse me the 19th it was firmly rejected but the key part was that"
"RsCujrLQU3E","483280","491760"," right here buyers stepped in I think this was the moment where longs in tech and big caps"
"RsCujrLQU3E","492400","499920"," that were reporting this week they were starting to pull back and then shift over into other"
"RsCujrLQU3E","500000","506080"," sectors if you're a bear this would give you a pause and they tried to dump it again on the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","506080","512320"," 27th yesterday and they failed and they should have had a fair if the market was going to let"
"RsCujrLQU3E","512320","519120"," go yesterday you really did want to watch IWM because this would have helped the fall of the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","519120","524960"," market if you saw a NASDAQ going down like it was and then if you had seen the IWM break here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","525600","532400"," you you couldn't make the case for rotation out of tech to some other index and so this is what I"
"RsCujrLQU3E","532400","539360"," watched yesterday was IWM and you saw this rejection here this does not bode well for bears this is"
"RsCujrLQU3E","539360","545360"," not a good indicator at this point for bears now some people will say that it looks like a reverse"
"RsCujrLQU3E","545360","550000"," head and shoulders or a right shoulder pattern that's bullish"
"RsCujrLQU3E","550960","552960"," um"
"RsCujrLQU3E","553520","559600"," that I don't believe in those patterns so sometimes I do but I tend not to go down the rabbit hole"
"RsCujrLQU3E","559600","565040"," on them I try to look at where the buyers and the sellers are where the demand lines are and"
"RsCujrLQU3E","565040","571120"," you can tell if there was demand here and there was demand here so that's cause for concern if I"
"RsCujrLQU3E","571120","576800"," was a bear I would uh scale back uh how much I'm shorting here at this point and there's another"
"RsCujrLQU3E","576800","582880"," reason for that um you've got some support here and some support here and this is showing to me"
"RsCujrLQU3E","582880","589040"," that the bulls are going to want to take a chance to break through this resistance here now this"
"RsCujrLQU3E","589040","595520"," might be on a on a short time frame just for the next two weeks maybe three weeks while we have"
"RsCujrLQU3E","596240","603120"," ER reports coming out from companies that make up a large percentage of the Russell especially"
"RsCujrLQU3E","603200","608720"," the 2000 even though there are some tech in the 1000s that are in the Russell 1000 that's very"
"RsCujrLQU3E","608720","618000"," for their very strong and makeup pet um that uh smaller index as well so um I want to take a look"
"RsCujrLQU3E","618000","623680"," at this closer here and before I before I put this under my day trading chart but if you were"
"RsCujrLQU3E","623680","627520"," trading monthlies or weeklies this is where you would be at you know you're three months you'd be"
"RsCujrLQU3E","627520","632640"," checking this side every day and then you come down to this one month chart here and you can start"
"RsCujrLQU3E","632640","637760"," to see you can start to see how this is working out over here and you can firm this up later if"
"RsCujrLQU3E","637760","642000"," you like but we don't we're not going to really trade here all right we can always come back and"
"RsCujrLQU3E","642000","648720"," tighten it up if you wanted to bring this down here and over time you will we're trying to get it"
"RsCujrLQU3E","648720","659280"," nice and tight let's start to look for even a little bump up right there you could even"
"RsCujrLQU3E","659280","664800"," tighten it up protect yourself put it right there somewhere down in here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","667280","672320"," that makes any sense even even the heat can even move it down slightly right there let's say"
"RsCujrLQU3E","673920","679680"," somewhere in there and it's all to your taste at that point but if you were a bear you would have"
"RsCujrLQU3E","679680","688160"," caught every one of these boom boom boom boom boom and stop right here so then we're going to go"
"RsCujrLQU3E","688240","692960"," to the five day let's go to one month again"
"RsCujrLQU3E","697920","700720"," and let's scroll back if we can a little bit"
"RsCujrLQU3E","704080","710000"," let's take a look right here so we know now we have some form of major support here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","710880","714000"," right and so you can put another line in or another support line"
"RsCujrLQU3E","714640","718960"," horizontal line somewhere in here you know we bounce right there"
"RsCujrLQU3E","721440","728400"," we'll make these that's kind of like a like a warning sign like you're looking at a stoplight right"
"RsCujrLQU3E","730320","737840"," this is where we bounced today and so then we're going to draw in some more we're going to put"
"RsCujrLQU3E","737840","743760"," another horizontal line in over here look like we got another one right about there"
"RsCujrLQU3E","748320","751760"," another one i get it you figure out what these hackies are in trading view"
"RsCujrLQU3E","753120","759040"," another one right here and that's looking that's looking pretty good right here right"
"RsCujrLQU3E","760000","761520"," so we're going to get down closer"
"RsCujrLQU3E","761520","769520"," and we're in the overnight session right now it's three o'clock in the morning we're about"
"RsCujrLQU3E","769520","776000"," to open i had to guess we're going to come down here today bounce off 270 or 2171"
"RsCujrLQU3E","776880","781920"," we might retest this again today and even if we don't retest this today i'm going to put in a"
"RsCujrLQU3E","781920","788880"," minor support line right in here and this is looking bullish to me for at least an attempt right"
"RsCujrLQU3E","789520","794320"," so i'm going to you can change this color if you like so that you can change this to a light blue if"
"RsCujrLQU3E","794320","800320"," you wanted to you might test here or here these will be your two your two tests anything below"
"RsCujrLQU3E","800320","805280"," that screen line is going to be bearish you'll probably i think you're going to open above here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","805840","812480"," if i had to guess and pop up and down but you've got this trading range here major resistance right"
"RsCujrLQU3E","812560","819040"," here and you've got to see this little break right here this was an indecision are we going up we're"
"RsCujrLQU3E","819040","829040"," going down where are we going so i'm going to put one more right there and so i bet somewhere in"
"RsCujrLQU3E","829040","834240"," here today you're going to get some bounces on iwm and you're going to find some major resistance"
"RsCujrLQU3E","834240","841200"," in here but you are also looking for something else you're looking for that bullish continuation"
"RsCujrLQU3E","841200","848400"," if you do break through somewhere in here to our 2209 and you're able to actually sit on top of"
"RsCujrLQU3E","848400","858240"," support up there on 22 16 maybe slightly higher 22 17 this would be very bullish this is becoming"
"RsCujrLQU3E","858240","863680"," this is becoming bullish but this is bullish and this here is very bullish so you're looking for"
"RsCujrLQU3E","863680","870240"," this over the next week or two this continuation up so you're at the beginning of an attempt to"
"RsCujrLQU3E","870240","877040"," turn iwm bullish right now unless market conditions were to say otherwise and i would be"
"RsCujrLQU3E","877040","882960"," looking for these trading levels on iwm as a bull and as a bear to find out if we are"
"RsCujrLQU3E","883840","890240"," on our way up or if we're on our way down and so you can take these numbers here and plug them in"
"RsCujrLQU3E","890240","895680"," to weebull accounts or you can sign up for this if you want and pay for real-time data i know"
"RsCujrLQU3E","895680","900160"," it's expensive but on weebull you can pump these numbers in and you've got your trading range"
"RsCujrLQU3E","900160","905360"," for the day here to use this over the core of buying weeklies you would know when to buy when"
"RsCujrLQU3E","905360","912480"," to sell depending upon what happens you could put a stop loss stop loss in down here at 2171 this"
"RsCujrLQU3E","912480","918080"," would be a major support for you you would notice that something is wrong or going bad or we're"
"RsCujrLQU3E","918080","925360"," just having a down day and you would if you were just bullish you could wait until we come to this"
"RsCujrLQU3E","925440","932080"," area here to go long iwm you could wait if your rig want to take some risk and see where we're"
"RsCujrLQU3E","932080","937600"," headed and think the next few days are going to be bullish then you would uh you would enter here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","937600","944880"," and and if if buyers showed up and ride this up okay so here's where you can do some research"
"RsCujrLQU3E","944880","948880"," this is why i like to see and you'll see these numbers hit in cash market as well"
"RsCujrLQU3E","949520","956960"," the rut does correlate to iwm pretty closely yes comes in very close spx does not"
"RsCujrLQU3E","959040","967680"," or excuse me the es mini comes in very close to spy correlate to some of the cash market charts"
"RsCujrLQU3E","968720","973520"," quite closely and so people tell you that doesn't matter or or futures charts don't"
"RsCujrLQU3E","973680","978160"," matter this should this proves to you otherwise you're just you're finding some of these supports"
"RsCujrLQU3E","979600","983920"," then you're finding a more consistent picture here in futures and you are finding"
"RsCujrLQU3E","985600","991360"," in the cash market charts so okay we're done with this and then we're going to head over to the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","991360","995920"," chart that i've been using with you guys if you use any charting software you want i did a previous"
"RsCujrLQU3E","995920","1001760"," video where i showed you the trend of a chart which way it's heading so we've already put these lines"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1001760","1010560"," in for the spy and uh you know i'm not long here on spy and i'm not long on spy on a"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1010560","1017200"," on a short time frame and i'm not long on spy on a long time frame especially in the seasonality"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1017200","1024800"," clock you know that at some points between now and september between now and september one the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1024800","1032720"," trend of spy should change uh or turn bearish until i would say at least october first"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1033280","1037920"," put it in around there uh you might give it a week or two on each side but we're definitely"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1037920","1044240"," gonna gonna do a pullback here for this run so uh for right now though you know you're looking at"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1044240","1049600"," this chart you can get a good feel of where we are uh you want to go long for a month out uh call"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1049600","1055840"," options probably not you're gonna go short here though probably not or you can go short"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1055840","1063120"," but you can't buy puts uh just straight puts here because of course usually uh the bulls can pin"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1064560","1072000"," the spy uh for a long period of time you'd kill your your puts here um but you could you could"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1072000","1076480"," short and pull back and have tight stops all the way up until it does drop you could get some put"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1076480","1081200"," spreads uh that would probably if you got them in the right not at the right uh strikes that would"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1081200","1086240"," still print at some point down the road uh but so you what what this would be good for right in the"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1086240","1092800"," spy right now is for day training uh or buying weeklies on dips at the ten or the twenty"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1094560","1098320"," even the five to some extent because this right here i think this is the five"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1099200","1106960"," uh they asked those the 90 m a so the 90 m a we touched and we touched there right here as well"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1106960","1112480"," we didn't right here we actually came through but the nine the nine's been quite respected okay"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1113600","1120080"," uh 10 m the 10 e m a s a moving average or at least on this in this one-year chart we'll get closer"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1120080","1124880"," down and we'll take a peek and see uh see where you can enter or weekly is even if you're selling"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1124960","1130080"," them same day if they're in the money they should print unless we're coming down which this here"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1130080","1139600"," still looks like we broke our um our uh all-time high and we're probably headed headed to some"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1139600","1146560"," volatility for at least a couple days to get some range expansion so we'll go to six months take a"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1146560","1150560"," close look and we're doing a daily if you're you're gonna do yourself your daily chart and see where"

"RsCujrLQU3E","1224160","1232480"," yesterday and there's another thing too that tends to happen each day is if futures uh let's"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1232480","1238800"," say futures uh rips higher in the overnight uh and there's a big gap right here where we haven't"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1238800","1244640"," traded it'll tend to want to come back to that and the same goes for the scene of the crime if you uh"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1244640","1250080"," go ahead and make this smile let's talk about scene of the crime so let's say we come up here"

"RsCujrLQU3E","1257200","1263040"," you will see a tendency in cash market to come back to the scene of the crime now this is pretty"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1263040","1269760"," clean anything that's done in the overnight session is low low liquidity so you'll see it has come back"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1269760","1277040"," to revisit those often and you're gonna be looking for the close of the day before you're"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1277120","1284640"," gonna put another another support line right in there okay and i don't see anything in overnight"

"RsCujrLQU3E","1359440","1364640"," this line but you can put something in here because this will show the open two days ago"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1366000","1372320"," on monday but i'm not really too concerned for this normally i'll wait and see what happens the first"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1372320","1376640"," five minutes let's say unless i unless i get a good feeling of where it's going and i want to"

"RsCujrLQU3E","1382480","1386720"," and then there's and then then you want to think about your overall bullishness this week we've"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1386720","1392000"," bullish today we know we've got f1c today we know we'll probably have some volatility today"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1392720","1399600"," so have i bullish on today probably not maybe app maybe later in the daytime i'd really like"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1399600","1406480"," us to see us get past this one right here i really like to see us get past here i might even make that a"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1406960","1415840"," another yellow line up here for an orange one that works so now i've got one two three four five"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1416480","1421440"," anything over here over this is bullish if we maintain this we're bullish again okay so now"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1421440","1429680"," you've got one two three four five now as your week progresses and wherever we close on today on"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1429680","1436320"," the 28th you can adjust these bands each day okay on your trading chart and over time you're"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1436320","1442160"," going to get a feel for uh are we bearish or bullish for the day and are we getting the bounce"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1442160","1446880"," here and moving up are we opening on the high because let's say we're opening up here in the high"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1446880","1451920"," one day there's a fair chance right we're coming back down here to the scene of the crime then"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1451920","1457760"," the open if we pop straight up there's a fair chance now we will sometimes gap and go if there's enough"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1457760","1463840"," volume but typically let's say three out of five trading days or yeah i'd say three out of five"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1463920","1472000"," trading days you can pretty much plot the direction of where uh your your index that you're playing"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1472000","1476720"," where your stock that you're playing is going with some other with some other information"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1476720","1480960"," now there's some other things you want to be looking for here you know that we have an established"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1480960","1487920"," trend line i think i hit the three month there i might be one month but you're also looking at"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1487920","1495280"," this right here this is important okay so you start adding all this stuff up so you've got all"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1495280","1502320"," your all your trend lines here for this week right and now you start to see that today probably looks"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1502320","1509200"," like what probably this is where bearish below here and we're bullish above right so you see this"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1509200","1514160"," trend line the bears want to break through this here this minor support here or major support"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1514720","1520160"," and start bringing us down so this is what you're looking at is the open today where do we open"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1520160","1525600"," do we bounce and move higher do we just go sideways all day long which is i would expect today that"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1525600","1532160"," we're going to go sideways we're going to dip down and try to try to beat through these these lines"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1532160","1538240"," here through FOMC if bears are unsuccessful or we have no bad news it's going to rock it back up"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1538880","1546640"," and i bet we could even possibly test all-time highs again coming into uh thursday friday"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1546640","1552240"," and that's where you get that 443 that everybody's talking about so if that happens on thursday"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1552240","1558320"," we might sell the news on friday or we might even bounce but come through here and make one last"
"RsCujrLQU3E","1558320","1563920"," shot to it on friday so this gives you your view your viewpoint for today and spy if you want to"
