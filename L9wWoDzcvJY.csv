"84430","84430"," Weird."
"111560","112460"," Alright."
"114780","116120"," Almost there. "
"117820","119540"," At least we're getting there."
"121260","123340"," I'll put a, uh, start a poll out there."
"126560","127539"," Will we get?"
"129460","130620"," It's an interesting morning. "
"136540","137660"," Will we get?"
"148460","149200"," Yes, no?"
"149780","150300"," No, okay."
"152940","153920"," Alright, turn that off."
"154140","154620"," Good morning, everybody. "
"154900","155660"," Hope you all had a great weekend."
"155780","156160"," Happy holidays."
"157260","163340"," And all I got, uh, was out with my wife this weekend doing some last minute stuff. "
"165720","170700"," Kids were all running around, family friends all around, so happy holidays to you."
"172180","173880"," Got some weirdness going on this morning."
"175220","177620"," Okay, let's go through some stuff. "
"177780","179540"," I hope I came on a slightly early."
"180300","186140"," We've got some stuff to talk about."
"186140","187000"," Oh, hold on a second. "
"187160","187880"," I got one more thing to do."
"191720","194080"," Never, never, never ends."
"194280","194600"," Does it?"
"195020","196180"," Weirdness going on this morning. "
"196580","197080"," Oh, hold on."
"197160","197760"," I got echo now."
"198960","200220"," I hope you link address. "
"203100","204700"," It's kind of weird hearing myself speak."
"223840","226260"," You know, this weekend, I heard the news."
"228920","230960"," From, uh, Elon. "
"232260","233580"," Let's see, uh."
"248530","252370"," I spent this weekend with some developers."
"254350","261210"," Because, uh, I'll bring this up for you, but you probably don't need to know too much about this. "
"261290","263830"," You probably do know something about this over the weekend."
"266790","271370"," Uh, you know, Twitter users will no longer be able to link to certain rival social media websites,"
"271370","275770"," including what the company describes Sunday as prohibited platforms, Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon."
"275770","279830"," He didn't, he didn't say there's some other ones that he listed. "
"280990","282250"," They didn't say YouTube."
"283310","286290"," So, but I know that some people had come out and talked about it."
"286430","288010"," So it was like panic weekend. "
"288870","290710"," Uh, we keep most of our content."
"291670","294110"," Uh, on Captain James.com."
"295370","301430"," For this reason, uh, if you've become de-platformed or if you, uh, if the, if the platform itself"
"301430","301970"," closes."
"301970","307820"," Uh, so we'll probably stop linking to live streams at some point. "
"307980","310660"," I don't know exactly how that's going to go with what happened yesterday with Elon."
"311300","313100"," Uh, but that's the reason."
"313420","317800"," So this weekend, uh, speaking with developers all weekend, have actually have meetings this morning"
"317800","318660"," that I have to go to. "
"319620","324960"," To ensure that, uh, depending upon what Elon does and Twitter does."
"325960","330760"," Let me see if I can, uh, see what you guys are saying here."
"331340","332560"," First good morning to all of you. "
"334820","335720"," Um, say good morning."
"335880","339260"," I asked good morning, Dylan, good morning, James, morning, Binky, morning, fishing with Panfish"
"339260","345640"," Dan, morning, Liam, good morning, Gil, Dean, Nino, Eric, meaties in the house, Mark Joshua, winky"
"345640","345860"," face."
"346300","351260"," Hey, winky, today I'm going to have probably some breaks and some meetings and I'm going to get you"
"351260","353620"," set up on discord this morning in between breaks. "
"356240","357300"," Uh, good morning H bomb."
"357640","358060"," Good morning Garrett."
"358760","359940"," Uh, who else is out there?"
"360860","362640"," Yeah, I don't care if they're yet. "
"362840","366580"," So we started the, we started the, uh, the process over the weekend."
"367000","372420"," We have to ensure that from our, from my end, I have to make sure that no matter what, uh,"
"372800","373680"," there's no risk of that."
"373800","374160"," You know, it's funny. "
"374440","378860"," Joe Donut and I talked about this at the beginning of doing this and I knew it was a threat"
"378860","382960"," and so it was like, it was, it was part of what we were doing, but it never became more"
"382960","383900"," amplified as."
"384480","385580"," Uh, what happened this weekend?"
"385780","386860"," Like it's just nonsense."
"387920","389440"," And they're just can't be any risk of that. "
"389540","393660"," They can't be a risk of blocking in on a Monday and your accounts turned off."
"393820","395340"," You don't, you just don't know what's going to happen."
"395720","403880"," Um, that I'm, I'm a nobody, but I did post something about, uh, the comedian, the comedy show, the,"
"404000","404960"," um, Dave Chappelle show. "
"406580","410020"," On my YouTube and I went to Twitter."
"410820","413920"," To upload a video that was not a relevant to it at all."
"414080","416760"," And I wasn't able to, I was, uh, I had a soft. "
"417380","422140"," I had a soft, uh, shadow ban on Twitter for at least the day, day and a half."
"422580","424020"," So I'm assuming it's not me."
"424200","428140"," It's, you know, they have some sort of code that they've written to. "
"429840","432020"," Find out who's connected to what and all that."
"432200","433780"," So I just don't want to deal with it."
"433780","437440"," Um, so good morning to all of you out there. "
"440220","441460"," Let me see who's out there right now."
"441540","442920"," So 63 of you viewing right now."
"443080","443220"," Okay. "
"443520","447120"," So, uh, this morning, you'll see me gone for part of the day."
"447180","448600"," I'll be in here in the office."
"449240","453620"," But I have some, uh, side back work, side work to do in the background. "
"453700","458080"," So I'll be on if there are critical juncture points in the market with you."
"458080","463680"," We're going to review the market real quick so that you guys can have a firm idea of where we"
"463680","463820"," are."
"463940","466060"," We're going for the rest of today. "
"466160","470020"," We should be expecting the rest of this week, or at least the beginning of this week."
"471140","476800"," Because we have some, we left off on Friday and kind of a weird place."
"477080","478640"," And we'll talk about that this morning. "
"478780","480140"," I think we talked about it on Friday too."
"480140","483140"," Yeah, we'll talk about it right now."
"486280","490040"," I shouldn't say I think I think we all I think we all knew to talk about this on Friday. "
"490040","492460"," So, let's take a look at this morning."
"493820","499400"," So when we came down here on on Friday of last week, right, I think everybody."
"500980","503660"," Would have preferred that if we came down and closed this gap. "
"505540","507280"," Set three seventy five level."
"507740","510540"," It actually extends slightly lowers three seventy three."
"511659","513120"," You call this part of the gap. "
"513760","516299"," And there's another tiny, tiny gap down here."
"516780","517919"," I want you to see that one."
"519179","523039"," And so the first first things first, if so, if we clear all this here, just so you can see"
"523039","523920"," this on a larger timeframe. "
"527400","528760"," Get rid of some of that crap there."
"531900","534360"," I'm going to show this to you in a larger timeframe here."
"536800","538980"," Yeah, so on a larger timeframe here, right?"
"539800","543420"," You know, we've got this the rest of this gap, if you see where my cursor is a tiny bit"
"543420","544080"," of gap down here. "
"544760","548060"," You know, any kind of if we trade up today at the bell, right?"
"548860","553560"," And we go up to let me get rid of this bears shit up here."
"553560","557860"," This bears have new low nonsense in the way."
"558540","561900"," So I want you to see these two yellow lines up here. "
"561980","564660"," This is a small gap above at three ninety six."
"564880","566660"," There's another gap above at four hundred."
"568100","573960"," The bulls are going to say they would prefer to see us just immediately go up and close this gap. "
"575500","578200"," Today off the bell, but we just we trade higher, right?"
"579200","583280"," And then eventually we we head up and close that first gap at three ninety six."
"583680","588280"," You end up getting some kind of a some kind of a bounce here or up up on our two,"
"588280","589100"," let's say our three."
"589940","592880"," And then a pullback and then a trade higher, right?"
"594440","598160"," We're going to talk about we're also going to talk about gamma negative gamma this morning and why"
"598160","598860"," we should head lower. "
"599880","601760"," That would be the preference, right?"
"601860","603420"," We trade up here start closing some gaps."
"603960","605580"," I think that's what the bulls want to say."
"605960","610460"," Bulls, though, shouldn't feel comfortable with a bounce here. "
"610800","613800"," And we'll talk about why this is where the pivot is, right?"
"614160","616620"," This is where zero gamma is."
"617220","619160"," And just below it is negative gamma."
"619680","622120"," We're going to bring up SPX for you real quick. "
"626040","627120"," See if I have this."
"627840","629680"," Yeah, I don't have it on this chart here."
"631800","634680"," Let me, uh, delete all the drugs here. "
"637800","642080"," Okay, so, you know, we have like."
"645660","647660"," So like three eight four six."
"651880","653440"," That's zero gamma right there. "
"653880","656060"," And then right below it, we have negative gamma."
"656300","657000"," It's like right here."
"657980","658600"," Like here's negative. "
"658760","659320"," This is SPX."
"659320","660960"," So we've got."
"669300","671780"," I have it on another, another instance of this. "
"672840","674220"," Another computer, but."
"679110","681490"," You know, this is zero gamma right where we are this morning."
"682390","686490"," And then right below it is negative gamma like this bad juju, right?"
"686890","687530"," This bad stuff. "
"691950","694630"," And then we don't grab any kind of normal gamma."
"706960","711460"," Now it's going to seem like it's going to seem like it's a ton, but truth is, right?"
"714680","715980"," This is on Friday, right?"
"716140","717380"," Until we start trading higher."
"719560","722640"," Until we start trading higher than. "
"724480","727960"," Then then the drop off on the 16th."
"727980","729200"," I think that's 16th right there."
"731740","732180"," Right. "
"732300","734460"," We don't get any kind of any kind of positive gamma in the market."
"734460","737280"," And then anything below, if we start trading below."
"738100","743680"," This bottom on Friday, you're going to see some real nastiness. "
"744940","747100"," So let's see if we put this in a five minute."
"749720","754740"," So basically you can't even start to get positive gamma until you go above our one."
"755280","759160"," The real scary part is that anything under. "
"760140","763300"," This S one and things we start film gaps down below."
"764460","769140"," So if I see anything today will if we see anything today, like we start trading below S one."
"769460","772780"," Start getting your pants on because we're going to be closing gaps down below. "
"774420","777800"," And really you don't see any positive gamma until above our one."
"778280","781000"," Even start thinking about closing gaps above right now."
"781000","784360"," So it's almost like a neutral place for the market. "
"786160","790400"," The the bouquets you really do want to close this gap down here."
"790560","791680"," This is like the safety trade."
"792740","794300"," You close the gap down below. "
"795040","799460"," Finally, you can go up and start closing some gaps above in kind of relative safety."
"800000","801600"," This is all negative gamma here, right?"
"801740","802980"," None of this is good for a bull."
"803340","804140"," It's solid rip. "
"804280","806480"," Every time you come in a resistance, you're going to sell the rip."
"807400","810200"," Fast moves up and then then they get sold, right?"
"810400","811260"," It's another place for."
"812720","814760"," For sellers to enter the market. "
"815360","818980"," So you can't you're not going to have a supportive market until you're above this R one."
"819780","822480"," So it's a key thing for you to realize today is."
"823400","826080"," How close we're negative gamma. "
"826740","827700"," Plan simple."
"829180","831480"," And as they start trading this down, right?"
"831760","833640"," It gets really nasty and vicious down here."
"834140","838040"," Any below S one is going to get big red bars to the depths of hell down here. "
"838100","839300"," So just be conscious of that."
"840500","842880"," Now on a larger time frame."
"844400","846120"," All charts say we're going down. "
"846420","853320"," So if we get some kind of a retracement up here 28 or 31 50 doesn't matter."
"853780","855100"," It doesn't really matter."
"855620","857900"," The market is still in a cell phase. "
"858460","862320"," So whether we get a Santa rally in here or not that the market is still in a cell mode."
"863300","867780"," And I'm got some from I'll show you later on today if I have a chance, but we should at"
"867780","869460"," some point sell down to this 356."
"870720","873200"," And if you look on a daily chart, it's a date with destiny. "
"880510","882210"," It's a date with destiny down here."
"882330","886970"," You can see the 200 weekly moving average coming right up right here."
"887090","891290"," And so it doesn't matter if we do something like this. "
"891450","892270"," Usually it's something like this."
"892370","896490"," We have retracement, but you're still going to see this in this process."
"897270","901650"," You know, if we close the gap and then do this right here and then come back down. "
"902230","903910"," That is what the market is showing."
"905370","907270"," So I don't know how to say to you."
"907370","912690"," I mean, you check it out on trading, but you can see that we're in that mode of selling this"
"912690","913050"," market. "
"913710","914810"," Let's just be aware of that."
"914970","916290"," So temporary or bullishness."
"916550","919970"," If there is a bullish move, know that it's just another opportunity. "
"920090","923870"," Well, you can trade it up higher, but then it's just another opportunity to have that date with"
"923870","924810"," destiny down here."
"925330","929130"," With the 50 with the 200 week moving average and we will talk about this."
"929350","931150"," I'll make a video or put a post out today. "
"931310","933070"," I have a post actually I broke for you."
"933450","934730"," I just haven't sent it to you yet."
"935130","937050"," About what happens if we break below. "
"938670","940010"," This weekly moving average."
"940050","942210"," This would be the market crash type scenario."
"942690","943550"," We might see it. "
"943630","944150"," They're going to make an attempt."
"944310","946550"," I think they're going to make an attempt for all the indicators."
"946850","948050"," And they're going to make an attempt for it. "
"948050","953430"," There are some accumulation notes that took place in June and October."
"954270","958670"," That would that would say we have a large area to grind through here to make this happen."
"959030","961570"," This could take one to three months to grind through this. "
"962310","965730"," But if they broke pull this, we're talking about January 7."
"966150","967210"," All over again."
"967550","972290"," This is where you'll see the VIX actually climb is if we break below and I'll have a post written"
"972290","972790"," about this."
"972790","978310"," When you'll see the VIX actually get nasty when you would see a 45 or a 70 down here. "
"979050","981990"," So you'll see that at some point today tomorrow."
"982390","986710"," You'll have an email to you so you can see the reason or how that plays out."
"993720","998300"," If I get some other stuff going on on the side some meetings this morning. "
"998700","1003660"," And if I see any pivots or anything like that, I will jump back on with you."
"1005000","1006020"," Hold on a second here."
"1016210","1017690"," You guys know how to trade the pivot. "
"1018610","1021110"," You know that negative gammas below S1."
"1021290","1023430"," You know that positive gammas above R1."
"1024410","1026829"," You know that there's a major and that was one other thing. "
"1026970","1029329"," I'm assuming it may wife to send this to me."
"1030190","1033630"," We are the one the bulls have one thing in their favor today too."
"1033650","1034869"," This is one good thing for the bulls. "
"1034869","1039210"," The market the SPX options complex is."
"1041109","1044670"," All bear it's it's just one sided puts."
"1045150","1047569"," And then there's just a little bit of calls out there. "
"1047569","1049470"," It's just all puts put dominated."
"1051390","1053470"," This could impact a move higher."
"1053470","1055030"," So those puts don't print. "
"1055990","1058970"," So the bear the bulls have some kind of."
"1060950","1064270"," If the bulls want to look at this in a positive light."
"1066130","1067670"," For the trade higher. "
"1068630","1070610"," It's that the market is just all puts."
"1070970","1071770"," That's all it is."
"1072970","1077310"," I don't know what they're saying on the Internet, but I'm downloading this every every morning. "
"1077930","1079650"," And it's just it's just all puts."
"1080990","1081690"," The wall of puts."
"1082190","1084070"," The whole market is well hedged. "
"1084390","1088950"," I don't know if they're saying that."
"1088950","1090650"," This is interesting things I was looking at this morning."
"1091850","1095410"," We're going to we're going to touch on a bunch of this stuff in this week's weekly brief. "
"1096250","1097050"," Bloomberg saying."
"1099590","1102710"," What I want to read with the with the blue with Bloomberg is saying something about."
"1103430","1107550"," The stock market is betting against the Fed right now. "
"1107570","1111230"," This is a proven eight billion euro equity injection by the German government."
"1112610","1116670"," And the truth is it's not the well the stock market is starting to bet against the Fed, but also"
"1116670","1120170"," the bond market is betting against the Fed."

"1263680","1263920"," It's like."
"1265380","1266160"," It's like not. "
"1266420","1267100"," It's not firm."

"1301060","1302160"," Yeah, there's no calls in the market."
"1302760","1304760"," I pulled up the data just about an hour ago. "
"1305380","1306640"," And there's no calls in the market."

"1315820","1317560"," Complex, but I did do a black schools model."
"1317560","1322220"," I take the total options data from the complex from each day."
"1323360","1327580"," And well, specifically for today's day, I'm looking for what's what's open. "
"1327580","1330240"," What's or what's open for total calls, total puts."
"1332480","1334640"," And then I times that by."

"1339280","1342000"," The swap rates and interest rates."
"1343480","1345100"," And then that number that I come up with."
"1345760","1349160"," I do a black schools model and find out where all of the. "
"1349900","1351140"," Options are in the market."
"1352720","1354420"," That creates a graph for me."
"1355040","1357640"," And I can see I can see where gamma levels are. "
"1364420","1369040"," It says thought says this thought as you can see below all the strikes and three, five, four, and a"
"1369040","1369600"," balance meeting."

"1375260","1375420"," Chase."
"1376380","1378140"," I'm not I'm not relying upon those guys anymore."
"1378240","1382280"," I'm getting my own fucking data like as good as it is as soon as it comes in. "
"1382360","1383640"," I'm getting it."
"1383640","1384340"," More than Stephen."

"1397120","1398760"," This is just a this is all of it."
"1399780","1403160"," Actually the data that I'm referencing is all of it every date."
"1403820","1405800"," Right now in the SPX complex. "
"1406560","1407840"," I guess I'm going to bounce them back and forth."
"1407980","1408580"," I'm saying to you."
"1411980","1413900"," It's it's it's so heavy right now. "
"1413900","1414540"," It's all puts."

"1517630","1518170"," Let me know in the chat. "
"1518290","1520950"," Do you think that Elon is going to step down or not."
"1522290","1526630"," You said that he would step down if the poll said for him to step down."
"1527050","1529330"," I want to know if you think he's going to step down. "
"1530130","1531030"," Good morning, all of you."
"1546580","1549320"," I'm a little shocked at the price of options this morning."
"1550220","1551760"," The options are really juice, huh?"
"1555880","1558640"," Options are super juice to this morning. "
"1564680","1566400"," Elon will step down for sure."
"1567320","1569300"," Even if he steps down, he'll still control it."
"1569780","1571260"," And I can't imagine you don't do it. "
"1571700","1573020"," I guess someone lined up for the job."
"1573180","1574260"," I think it's all for show."
"1574520","1576280"," He knew that before he posted that poll agreed. "
"1578080","1578740"," Some friends."
"1578960","1587060"," Some Tesla bulls and I were talking in the background past couple of weeks about the risk of the"
"1587060","1595600"," float banks or just opening yourself up to the sharks."
"1596000","1599240"," There's power money sharks in the background. "

"1604360","1605980"," Whenever they can step in and."
"1607900","1609580"," And sees an opportunity, they will. "
"1617100","1619140"," So Devin saying that Elon is the king of SEO."
"1619380","1620280"," There's a reason he's doing this."
"1620440","1621000"," It's a fair point. "
"1621000","1626980"," I mean, in the background, I kind of wondered if he if this was all planned from the beginning."
"1628380","1629520"," That if he had backers."
"1631180","1634300"," At the closing stock price, if it didn't matter. "
"1635020","1636540"," It was just easier to make it look like."
"1637820","1641660"," Him somewhat to be the bad guy where you couldn't have."
"1642300","1645340"," Certain people step into attempt to buy. "
"1646160","1646920"," Or Twitter."
"1648040","1650620"," There's like a frontman for it would make sense to."
"1651460","1655600"," And then said by fuck not by fucked up, but you know, I'm going to pass it off to these"
"1655600","1656080"," guys now. "
"1656920","1658380"," It's it's kind of like a better."
"1660780","1661980"," It's better publicity."
"1667500","1668820"," But there's some. "
"1669440","1670040"," There's some."
"1671740","1677240"," You know, you don't want to step in or who can step in and offer to buy Twitter and not"
"1677240","1678000"," be looked upon."
"1681220","1683640"," As oh, no, they'll never let that guy buy it. "
"1683960","1687220"," But if you learn take it's like, you know, it's like, it's like real estate."
"1687900","1691840"," To an extent when you do a wholesale deal with somebody on a property that's not on market."
"1693140","1694580"," I have some friends that are. "
"1697260","1698140"," Attorneys and."
"1699360","1702320"," They'll call up and say, Hey, do you want to do a wholesale deal?"
"1702580","1703100"," It's not on the market."
"1703420","1704460"," They just want to get rid of it. "
"1704520","1705540"," Usually I put probate stuff."
"1706460","1708520"," And it's like fast money, fast cash."
"1709660","1711720"," And you is not negotiating. "
"1711940","1712660"," It's just as is."
"1714720","1716280"," It's similar to others."
"1716320","1718020"," I think there might be a similar. "
"1721300","1723680"," It's like counter that, but still kind of similar."
"1727760","1728440"," Yeah, then."
"1728820","1730320"," You know, I'd be honest with you. "
"1731040","1732460"," Like our dislike, Elon."
"1733220","1739180"," And what he's like, or dislike what he wants positions on stuff are just the whole CEO thing is."
"1740080","1741880"," Right now is mind boggling to me. "
"1742940","1747300"," I don't want to see any CEO of a large corporation acting like he is right now at all."
"1749700","1751540"," I have zero tolerance for it."
"1752520","1756180"," It's what it's very worrisome because I got some friends about it. "
"1756360","1757520"," He's reminding me of."
"1760340","1761700"," What's his face there from."
"1765480","1766360"," Cowered hues. "
"1766580","1768200"," I mean, it's totally reminding me of how it is."
"1770300","1773780"," And so it makes you wonder if it's going to become worse as time passes."
"1775420","1777320"," It makes you worry about the future of. "
"1781320","1782820"," You guys to get worse to get better."
"1784240","1787900"," You know, you don't want to be going to Mars with anyone like that, right?"
"1788580","1788840"," I don't know."
"1789160","1790860"," I don't know if any of you have been in the military. "
"1791920","1793920"," If any of you have been in the military."
"1795740","1798620"," You find out real, real fat, there's different levels of it."
"1798620","1800820"," Like you find out in training who's what and who's what. "
"1801280","1803760"," You get deployed and it's who's what and who's what and then."
"1804960","1808640"," If you're in the fire site, the groups just get smaller and smaller and smaller."
"1809700","1812780"," If you're in any kind of combat or anything like that, you wind up. "
"1812980","1816340"," Your groups of people that you're willing to trust get smaller and smaller and smaller."
"1816980","1819240"," And you never know who those people are, but I would assume."
"1820520","1823980"," If you go to Mars and stuff like that, like you just can't have people. "
"1825320","1826440"," Like that around you."
"1827240","1828320"," It's highly risky."
"1830120","1831180"," I don't know. "
"1831460","1835960"," So I'm having all these like existential thread things about this."
"1843300","1843980"," Yeah, I understand."
"1844240","1845140"," I get I get all that. "
"1845300","1846340"," He's doing to be in the public eye."
"1847360","1850140"," But from the from a corporate standpoint, it's there."
"1850440","1850820"," There are some. "
"1851880","1854340"," You know, it does it does raise questions about."
"1856200","1858000"," In a little bit of bid right now."
"1862320","1865320"," You can see that there's some buyers and some kind of a bottom farming. "
"1869760","1871940"," So yes, still having tested the low here."
"1872420","1875880"," Haven't tested the low here from the 16th."
"1876440","1878020"," Haven't tested the low down here. "
"1878940","1879900"," Haven't tested these lows."
"1881700","1883100"," Just a weird day, right?"
"1883700","1884840"," Holiday holidays, man."
"1885100","1885720"," Holidays are weird. "
"1886720","1892400"," My other question I had was there was some news stories that said that they'd be selling into."
"1893080","1894820"," There would be some selling into strength."
"1895540","1898780"," Remember the last couple weeks, wherever we get to strength, they'd be selling into it. "
"1899360","1900780"," And there would be some support in the market."
"1901260","1903120"," When strength would come in, they'd sell into it."
"1903780","1905100"," And I wondered if we'd get any of that. "
"1906540","1908400"," So it would be like that slow grind up."
"1911780","1913180"," For your holiday rally."
"1913380","1915020"," Some years we get holiday rallies are weird. "
"1915540","1918860"," It's like really weird sideways and up move."
"1920820","1924260"," So anytime you get any kind of strength, they're just selling into it to the end of the year."
"1940320","1941300"," Coming into the. "
"1943200","1944940"," 20 and a on the."
"1945720","1948880"," Five minutes chart need to break above this pivot right now."
"1964050","1965830"," Yes, so every saying true car. "
"1965970","1966830"," I don't even know if it's character."
"1967290","1968870"," I had some weird shit in the military."
"1969530","1970730"," People that I thought were. "
"1972350","1974270"," I thought I knew people in the military."
"1974510","1978510"," Then people that people go AWOL and you're like that."
"1978930","1979710"," You know, that guy is like. "
"1981190","1983010"," Like why that guy go AWOL?"
"1983850","1984950"," You know, he's an HQ."
"1985310","1988170"," This guy, you know, perfect uniform, perfect this."
"1988170","1991450"," Some really strong people that weren't as strong as you thought they were. "
"1992550","1994290"," Intestinal fortitude kind of stuff."
"1999660","2002000"," We used to always say it is like those that."
"2003300","2006660"," Those that retreat those that hold and those that go forward and. "
"2008540","2011160"," It's different different, different crowd of people."
"2011940","2013880"," Oh, three different kinds of people."
"2014420","2015980"," And there's like different layers to it. "
"2027180","2028560"," We're getting rejected off that."
"2030000","2031900"," Off that 20 right now."
"2032960","2034120"," Need to break above it. "
"2042010","2043210"," Trying to right now."
"2055150","2057409"," I can't I'm not buying into it right now."
"2057590","2058330"," I don't know. "
"2058590","2060010"," I don't know if it's six D."
"2060429","2060850"," I don't know."
"2061389","2063370"," You know, like how he sets up the questions on Twitter."
"2065989","2067530"," You know, because he's going to give up. "
"2068610","2070150"," I don't know the entire story."
"2070270","2071570"," I don't think you and I will ever will."
"2071909","2073290"," We're just the plabs were nobody. "
"2074050","2076150"," But I certainly don't like how it's played out."
"2082270","2083010"," Yeah, man."
"2083310","2084449"," So, you know, like. "
"2085570","2086570"," I did this winter."
"2086889","2090630"," I went to this winter trading once and I slept with two other."
"2090870","2091630"," My squad. "
"2091909","2092670"," Not my squad, right?"
"2093469","2094650"," We slept together."
"2095030","2098410"," Dick's assholes and they we found a small out house in the middle of nowhere."
"2099250","2101190"," And we slept at Dick's asses. "
"2101990","2104650"," Like leaning up like sideways on a wall."
"2105550","2107230"," We hadn't slept in days."
"2107550","2109590"," We hadn't slept in days when cold to the bone. "
"2110570","2114850"," They gave us like a couple sheets of like all of drab, like."
"2116370","2119170"," Two man tent shit and it was it was fucking nightmare."
"2120610","2122190"," It was it was a nightmare. "
"2122570","2123630"," That's kind of thing where you like."
"2124350","2126350"," You stick your hands inside of some guys."
"2126350","2127710"," Arm pits to keep warm. "
"2128850","2131210"," You got to clean your balls and take your shoes."
"2131210","2132530"," Your socks off and change them."
"2132870","2134930"," It's like blowing minus 30. "
"2135750","2136610"," It's so cold."
"2139020","2140600"," It's kind of shit that I like break a man."
"2141560","2144700"," I remember we did this like we did this to finish it up. "
"2145360","2148460"," We did like a 30 kilometer forced March."
"2149160","2151140"," And we're all like full battle rattle and all that shit."
"2151360","2156920"," And I remember we got done and they had this big fire and stuff and I passed out. "
"2156920","2157580"," I got to stand straight up."
"2158380","2160700"," And I fell backwards."
"2162360","2165500"," And just out. "
"2171980","2172920"," It's true story."
"2173120","2174280"," It's goddamn true story."
"2181900","2182680"," That's the good. "
"2182800","2183760"," They're teeing off right now."
"2184060","2186200"," They're teeing off that it that that wheat that EMA."
"2190800","2193780"," I got all kinds of horrible, horrible army stories. "
"2195500","2198000"," Probably most of them are, most of them you can't talk about."
"2202000","2205030"," I got a crazy story."
"2206850","2208690"," So I used to have to sit in these meetings. "
"2209950","2212250"," So at one point I was in U.S. Army command."
"2212550","2217690"," I was a driver for some higher up stories."
"2218430","2222770"," And I always see people talk about North Korea. "
"2223310","2228190"," And the biggest fear that the U.S. Army ever had was never any kind of war with North Korea."
"2228330","2232190"," It was always if they just opened the border up."
"2233290","2235150"," Maybe nothing that the military could do. "
"2236510","2238250"," If North Korea ever opened up their border."
"2238570","2241290"," You know, like the North come down and the South meet and all that kind of shit."
"2242350","2244450"," The biggest fear that military ever had. "
"2244950","2245810"," To be surprised."
"2246330","2249090"," I guess, try to relate that to you'd be surprised behind the scenes."
"2250210","2251470"," What the greatest fears are. "
"2252570","2254230"," Versus what's the public."
"2255250","2255390"," Things."
"2260730","2264370"," Yeah, exactly. "
"2264670","2265710"," But I'll start in the stone at 11."
"2270650","2273330"," They got to teach you how to keep yourself warm, right?"
"2274550","2276050"," And when you're cold, you do push-ups."
"2277430","2279010"," Supine bicycle stuff like that. "
"2287710","2289150"," Yeah, it's cold, Emerson, man."
"2289450","2290170"," I'll tell you what."
"2291610","2292850"," I'll tell you what, man. "
"2293170","2293710"," I'll never forget."
"2293710","2294970"," I'll never forget that shit."
"2296010","2296750"," So cold. "
"2298850","2301790"," And I've lived in mountains like I've done winter camping."
"2302170","2302490"," I've done."
"2302830","2303990"," Matter of fact, I hiked. "
"2304830","2306470"," I hiked the."
"2308990","2310970"," Southern Tetons, the Wind River Range."
"2312230","2314590"," I had that in winter. "
"2315890","2319870"," I went through the south pass south pass."
"2320250","2321410"," I think it's south pass or something."
"2322770","2324750"," I spent a couple weeks doing that. "
"2324750","2325990"," We almost died there twice."
"2326090","2326850"," Me and my buddies."
"2327770","2328810"," I thought we were going to die. "
"2329090","2332730"," We went, we were there and I had one friend that was a gear head."
"2333090","2333830"," Then they got the best gear."
"2335150","2336090"," And I had a hippie friend. "
"2337010","2338170"," The hippie friend was fine."
"2339530","2342030"," Him and I wound up sleeping together in the same tent."
"2342210","2342890"," He brought a three season. "
"2343010","2343730"," I brought a four season."
"2344590","2346010"," And we ended up sleeping together with the dog."
"2346750","2351190"," And then our gear friend became hypothermic over the course of about three days. "
"2353350","2355110"," And he had non-mountain emergency."
"2355210","2355690"," It was pretty bad."
"2357910","2358850"," It was scary. "
"2359710","2362590"," The weirdest part was that we were in the middle of nowhere."
"2362950","2364850"," Like this is the middle of nowhere in Wyoming."
"2366770","2368470"," And hundreds of miles away from anybody. "
"2369630","2371870"," It was about 120 mile walk or something like that."
"2372490","2377850"," And we met a woman, a young woman out in the middle of the middle of nowhere, which was really"
"2377850","2378130"," weird."
"2378750","2380150"," And she was cowboy camping. "
"2381070","2382130"," Which I was like, this is crazy."
"2382390","2383290"," It's just cowboy cabin."
"2385490","2390890"," Blowing snow minus 20 when it would snow and like ice rain and snow and stuff like that. "
"2395470","2399270"," He tripped up into a boat and fell face on a blackish water or a shark blood."
"2399710","2400870"," Oh man, that's crazy, Casey."
"2403730","2405650"," He had a house built builder data at 10. "
"2409990","2410590"," It's weird."
"2411490","2413170"," You guys can't trust the Fed."
"2413310","2413810"," You know that, right?"
"2414070","2416090"," I hope you guys don't trust the Fed. "
"2416690","2420030"," The Bloomberg's pushing that bullshit this morning too."
"2420890","2421990"," It's not the stock market."
"2422170","2422870"," It's the bond market. "
"2423550","2426170"," The stock market follows what the bond market's following."
"2426930","2429870"," They're selling that 20."
"2430410","2432950"," The 20 EMA and the five-minute chart, they're selling it. "
"2433390","2434670"," They're teeing off on it right now."
"2435650","2439530"," Hopefully we can get back to go back and retest."
"2439530","2442690"," Retest this previous low from Friday right there. "
"2444230","2448690"," And the preference would be to go all the way down and close the gap."
"2448890","2454190"," The gap is down below, which are 375, 373, somewhere in here."
"2456350","2459170"," My favorite title of this week's weekly brief hand grenades and horseshoes. "
"2463570","2466110"," I'll leave that right there so you can see where the gap closes."
"2467110","2470810"," This is the gap from Friday."
"2470810","2474870"," And then there's a gap below it at 373 that we've been talking about for some time now. "
"2479630","2480990"," Yeah, I don't want anything to do with this."
"2482710","2485890"," I figured if we, well, I figured we either, we're either going to gap up here."
"2486630","2490870"," Or, you know, you're either going to gap up or you're going to sell down on Friday, right?"
"2491230","2492310"," I think Chase even said that. "
"2493170","2495990"," Chase was like, eh, look, look there."
"2496070","2497710"," They're going to try to tee off into the close here."
"2497710","2503290"," I'm German finance ministers talk about an aggressive response from them to the U.S. Inflation"
"2503290","2504070"," Reduction Act. "
"2504450","2507170"," There's a way to ensure that EU security of supply regarding."
"2507390","2508890"," It's not exactly true as well."
"2509250","2512950"," You guys want to look at the impact with the eligible tax credits in the same way as American"
"2512950","2513490"," products?"
"2513950","2519830"," Except in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act should cover partners and allies like the EU. "
"2520230","2525050"," The pledge to strengthen strategic sovereignty and deliver on climate objectives as well has been"
"2525050","2525330"," reiterated."
"2525970","2527310"," France and Germany say."
"2528810","2533210"," You guys want to, they will ensure that European industry has access to affordable and sustainable"
"2533210","2534610"," electricity as well. "
"2536930","2538050"," So let's start with."
"2538270","2539350"," So what's the value?"
"2539710","2545310"," You trade policy instruments to preserve the single market from distortions and ensure global level"
"2545310","2545850"," playing field."
"2546630","2553570"," Okay, so this is, this is what's going to be in your weekly brief. "
"2569260","2572900"," So what you're looking for here is, I'm sitting doing one hour, maybe."
"2574910","2577190"," It's been 10 minutes time now after the top of the hour."
"2577490","2583410"," You get the U.S. NAHB housing market index for December forecast 34 and the prior 33. "
"2585130","2589090"," You are actually looking for a dipped by down here, longing bonds."
"2589550","2591090"," Okay, longing high quality bonds."
"2594300","2598780"," And I'm going to show you why you're looking for a bottom to buy down here and high quality bonds. "
"2601560","2606520"," I'd really like to see like this 102 100, nice, nice flat number."
"2606860","2610000"," I like 102, like 100 102 somewhere in this area."
"2610740","2612300"," See, you can see where it is right here. "
"2615650","2617090"," Now, why I like it down here?"
"2617290","2619130"," You could possibly buy this down here."
"2619290","2625050"," You can see where, as you come down here right now, you can see where they teed off."
"2626050","2628270"," So maybe you'll get a little intraday push here. "
"2629030","2635190"," But the reality is that down here and right here is where you really want to get in if you"
"2635190","2636510"," can, if you can get anything down here."
"2636550","2638030"," I'm going to explain to you why right now, okay?"
"2639830","2641210"," Why you want to be longing bonds?"
"2642110","2648190"," Now, you could be short the market, long bonds, and then individual growth stocks, things like"
"2648190","2648350"," that."
"2648610","2649070"," SAP 500. "
"2650750","2653570"," I'm going to go over to you, I'm going to go over this why right now."
"2659050","2660650"," Bring this back over here for you."
"2673460","2674440"," Let me just take it. "
"2677970","2680410"," I wish I could do two screeners."
"2681990","2684930"," I'm going to put like leave this chart up and then bring up."
"2688190","2690090"," I think we'll start with SPX. "
"2690330","2690710"," We'll lay it out."
"2691610","2692590"," Nice and simple."
"2705880","2706860"," We'll actually come back. "
"2707080","2709380"," No, we'll look at SPX, just like in here."
"2713770","2714130"," Okay."
"2717690","2719330"," Ooh, we got the federal funds rate down here. "
"2723450","2724250"," This is the unemployment rate."
"2724650","2725650"," That's the way we've talked about this, right?"
"2727510","2729830"," Talked about wanting to see this unemployment rate come up."
"2733930","2737970"," Now, when you see this unemployment rate come up, you're going to then see a market bottom. "
"2737970","2742170"," I want you to be aware of this as time moves forward."
"2743010","2750350"," You really want to see layoffs coming into the new year and ramping up to the end of 2024."
"2750950","2753990"," You'll likely see a market bottom at that point. "
"2755310","2756810"," Doesn't matter if we trade sideways."
"2758630","2759870"," You'll be looking for some kind of bottom."
"2760790","2764670"," Now, at some point, the market believes the Fed is fighting. "
"2764670","2768130"," Notice how the Fed is focusing so much on inflation."
"2769510","2774150"," They don't want to say to you that they want to focus on job destruction."
"2775470","2776290"," It's not good politically. "
"2776730","2777430"," It's not good."
"2778470","2780030"," It doesn't look good publicly."
"2780970","2783050"," But the reality is they want job destruction. "
"2783430","2788570"," I want you to know that if you're a market participant, I want you to know that if you're just"
"2788570","2794870"," a guy on Main Street, especially new to the market, there are things that can't be said publicly."
"2795610","2796650"," And that's what they want right there."
"2798890","2805270"," Now, historically, we have times where the market will trade up, actually, if the market believes"
"2805270","2806950"," that the Fed is fighting court and court inflation. "
"2807930","2810990"," So you would see that you would actually see the unemployment rate rise."
"2811210","2814990"," You'd see the Main Street burning and the stock market would trade higher."
"2815250","2816710"," But right now, nobody believes the Fed. "
"2818010","2819790"," You're not seeing this happen, right?"
"2820670","2823450"," You could have actually seen this happen back here, too."
"2823690","2827050"," You would have seen this go up while unemployment was coming up."
"2827370","2829430"," But you can see here that that didn't happen, right?"
"2830850","2836450"," You can see here that jobs kept going or unemployment kept getting or the rate of unemployment was"
"2836450","2837270"," going lower and lower. "
"2837650","2841970"," If the rate of unemployment was going up here, you could possibly see the stock market go up."
"2842850","2845290"," I'll show you this historically, what I mean by this."
"2846130","2847710"," But you're not seeing that right now. "
"2848110","2851850"," Now, if you look at a smaller, smaller time frame, you see this right here."
"2852930","2853910"," It's starting to come up."
"2857450","2859010"," I want you to see that right there, okay?"
"2860650","2864950"," But on a much larger time frame, it's not quite there yet. "
"2874120","2876480"," Doing five minutes time now at the top of the hour."
"2876480","2882140"," Now, do you get the USNAHB housing market index forecast 34 on the prior 33?"
"2890460","2891200"," Bond yields."
"2895920","2897040"," Fed funds rate. "
"2899520","2901060"," This is the effect of fire."
"2901260","2901640"," Oh, wait a minute."
"2901780","2902240"," Hold on here. "
"2905700","2906340"," You pay."
"2909340","2911480"," This is important for one for you to see, okay?"
"2911600","2912280"," This Fed funds rate."
"2913360","2916100"," We're going to move to a weekly chart or a monthly chart. "
"2952720","2956400"," I just want you to see, I just want you to see right here, okay?"
"2957780","2958740"," Zen employment rate."
"2959960","2960700"," Fed funds rate."
"2962260","2965520"," This is inflation. "
"2966440","2969480"," No matter what you say to me, inflation's coming down, right?"
"2969840","2970500"," You want to see that."
"2970700","2971960"," That's just like positive right here."
"2972580","2973480"," This is what you want to see. "
"2973520","2974420"," This is like a check mark."
"2974680","2974720"," Good."
"2975940","2977260"," Fed funds rate rising, right?"
"2979900","2981840"," And you still, this is what you'd want to see. "
"2981900","2985200"," You want to see this up, this down, right?"
"2985560","2987120"," And this, this we're actually right here is fine."
"2987300","2988080"," This doesn't need to go any higher."
"2988600","2990000"," This is what you want to see for a market bottom. "
"2990460","2991120"," We're not seeing that."
"2992580","2994080"," I'm going to show you some times in history."
"2995520","2996480"," They're similar, okay?"
"3008120","3014480"," And you can see how unemployment comes coming up, right?"
"3014860","3017080"," Dips a little bit, starts really cranking, right?"
"3017480","3017960"," Really cranking. "
"3018920","3020940"," You see that the Fed will cut rates here, right?"
"3021360","3023640"," Before we have that last little crash, right?"
"3023760","3024680"," We haven't seen that, have we?"
"3026300","3028280"," Sorry, am I getting this wrong here?"
"3028500","3029400"," I think this is the unemployment rate."
"3031200","3033100"," Yeah, the unemployment rate is cranking right here."
"3034160","3037520"," This is inflation coming down, right here. "
"3037640","3039700"," This is what the Fed fund rate cuts right here, okay?"
"3043680","3044660"," This is 81."
"3046480","3048500"," Actually, see some other places where it's happened."
"3050940","3052060"," Same thing right here. "
"3055580","3056860"," See how the ramp up of unemployment?"
"3057280","3058520"," We are, we're not seeing that yet, are we?"
"3059800","3063620"," But when they start to see this unemployment ramping up, they trigger and cut."
"3063900","3064380"," Does that make sense?"
"3066040","3068060"," Inflation's already come down back here in the past."
"3073830","3076490"," You kind of see the same thing back here in 1980, right?"
"3077610","3084810"," You can see that unemployment is up, they cut rates, right?"
"3085850","3087930"," And inflation's already rolled over here, right?"
"3102120","3103200"," This is 1974. "
"3104180","3105400"," It's kind of similar, right?"
"3105520","3106300"," We already made our way down."
"3107620","3108920"," But unemployment was already up, right?"
"3108920","3110420"," When they cut the rates."
"3112760","3114240"," And inflation was already cut it out. "
"3114300","3116080"," It wasn't too bad here in 1974."
"3123060","3125080"," So this is kind of the last one you're looking for here."
"3125400","3126300"," You're looking for this. "
"3126480","3131940"," And this is what I was trying to say to you was, that you want to see this unemployment rate"
"3131940","3132640"," rise here."
"3134200","3136620"," And we're not getting that unemployment rise here."
"3137180","3142000"," So I will say that I was surprised that they didn't cut rates this past rate cycle. "
"3142800","3147280"," But the bond market is telling you, and I'll show you the bond market, I'll show you where the bond"
"3147280","3153340"," market is already betting against further raises from the Fed's Fed funds rate."
"3153900","3158840"," And you'll probably see this unemployment rate rise in January, February, March."
"3159620","3164880"," And when they re-meet for their next Fed rate decision, they'll pause or cut. "
"3165200","3169620"," That's why I say you likely have seen the last Fed rate hike."
"3171220","3176740"," And they'll continue to wait and see if this rate ends up rising here."
"3181020","3182840"," I'm bringing one more up for you here. "
"3184780","3186280"," We'll leave unemployment there."
"3186760","3187560"," We'll take off inflation."
"3188820","3189920"," And we're going to add in. "
"3193520","3194860"," Do I have it here?"
"3196940","3197680"," Let me see here."
"3205120","3206460"," Right here, yield curve."
"3209220","3214780"," And what I want to show you in the bond market is a couple things. "
"3215980","3223720"," You can see that the bond market is betting against and move down in the Fed funds rate."
"3224820","3230420"," The Fed funds rate keeps going up and the yield is going to keep going up here, betting against it."
"3233040","3236000"," And maybe that's a bear out there that's like doom and gloom. "
"3237020","3241180"," Let's just look back and historically how deep we actually are right now."
"3242080","3248460"," And I want you to see these two places that I marked back here in 2000 and 2007."
"3248480","3250260"," You can see that they cut rates, right?"
"3252620","3255040"," Just as the yield curve started to come up. "
"3255760","3256320"," You see that?"
"3258000","3258880"," It cut rates."
"3259320","3265420"," The yield curve started to come up and you're already starting to see this curve was the bond"
"3265420","3268360"," market telling you that the Fed is going to cut rates."
"3268940","3270460"," Do you see here?"
"3271680","3273160"," And the Fed cut rates. "
"3274020","3278700"," And this is the continued down right here, right?"
"3280920","3282140"," I'll tell you see later on."
"3282560","3285860"," And the one thing that you haven't seen here is the rise of unemployment."
"3287020","3287800"," You see that?"
"3288340","3291700"," And so you're looking for that same thing to happen that hasn't happened yet. "
"3292220","3295060"," You're looking for the rates to get cut, right?"
"3295220","3300440"," So when you're like, hey, I don't believe that."
"3300440","3302140"," I think you are lying to me."
"3303220","3304000"," Does that make sense?"
"3304340","3305680"," So this has not happened yet. "
"3306720","3311760"," This has not happened yet, but we know in previously in history that that is what happens."
"3316460","3318000"," Does that now clear?"
"3318120","3321180"," Does that now clarify why you shouldn't believe the Fed?"
"3323020","3326060"," When they say that they're going to continue to raise rates?"
"3330800","3331100"," I don't know."
"3331280","3333980"," If I'm fine enough, it may be complicated that too much. "
"3335900","3342300"," Now, what the point they're trying to make to you is that the Fed, the bond market is saying to"
"3342300","3344120"," you, oh, fuck, no, they're going to cut rates."
"3345240","3348520"," Now, even though they cut rates, that doesn't mean we continue down in the market."
"3348740","3349720"," There are some times in history. "
"3350240","3359960"," In the 1960s and early 1970s, when you had that Volcker moment too, the market believed"
"3359960","3361460"," that Volcker was serious."
"3362760","3369300"," So when I talk about J-PAL, I'm thinking, is he thinking this is a Volcker moment where he should"
"3369300","3375080"," have cut rates already this past rate decision, but he's going to stay firm this year?"
"3375340","3377860"," Maybe save the market with that kind of experience."
"3377960","3380440"," At least earlier, so 25 basis points. "
"3380440","3381940"," Now, the market will come up because of that."
"3382920","3389120"," I would have preferred to have seen a 75 basis point shock and we start rolling it now and maybe"
"3389120","3390140"," bounce off 3100."
"3392420","3393800"," That's where the problem comes in. "
"3394080","3399620"," If you think tight here, this is where some problems come in."
"3403420","3415010"," So if that's not what they're trying to do, if"
"3421120","3425020"," that's what they're not trying to do, if they're trying to trade the market sideways here, let's"
"3425020","3427480"," say they say, oh, yeah, we're going to do 4000 and lower."
"3427480","3434520"," And you begin to slip under this weekly moving average here, right?"
"3439740","3443940"," When we normally do that, it usually doesn't end well. "
"3444440","3446340"," It usually ends up getting really nasty."
"3448080","3448920"," We can see that."
"3449180","3451240"," So we had one touch here and came right back up, right?"
"3451520","3455560"," Kiwi was instituted one touch up here, same thing, same thing, same thing. "
"3456140","3469340"," Now, when we've slipped below, when"
"3469340","3473620"," we actually slip below, you can see what actually how bad stuff gets."
"3474220","3480000"," You can actually see that we'll slip below the weekly moving average, retest it, and then start,"
"3480700","3486740"," you know, you're talking about, this is 2001, March 2001, didn't finish until March 2003."
"3487360","3487980"," That's two more years. "
"3488280","3491080"," That's 2023, 2024."
"3492260","3495460"," Same thing back here, slipped underneath it."
"3496800","3499160"," June 16th of 2008. "
"3499960","3504240"," Didn't recover until March 16th of 2009."
"3507930","3509650"," There were some other years back here."
"3511920","3513640"," Always above it. "
"3514140","3514540"," Let's see again."
"3522040","3523220"," Slip below."
"3524060","3525140"," Deep, right?"
"3525440","3526600"," Deep, deep, 1970. "
"3528320","3530140"," Two bounces move forward."
"3530360","3534640"," This is 1963, 1962, 1966 here."
"3535300","3540540"," And then 1969, slipped below it, real bad, real bad, 1974, right?"
"3541620","3543680"," There's some interesting stuff about down here. "
"3544320","3550120"," I believe this is when they were using interest rates down by around one percent now."
"3551080","3553460"," Modern monetary theory, we use QE, right?"
"3553940","3557740"," Back here, we used to use interest rates to make sure everyone was employed."
"3558740","3561200"," So we would actually, in the inverse of that, right?"
"3561500","3568520"," We had high employment, low unemployment, and they would actually force us down, which is similar"
"3568520","3572460"," to what we're doing right now, trying to grind us off of this. "
"3573360","3579400"," So using interest rates to slow the economy down until unemployment can catch back up."
"3579400","3580560"," That might not happen."
"3580600","3587040"," If that doesn't happen, we end up coming into this slipping below this weekly moving average. "
"3587640","3592740"," So I want you to be focused on this as we head into the New Year, head into March."
"3593600","3603360"," If we slip below this and Jerome Powell commits to, I'm not going to"
"3603360","3604960"," lower interest rates, right?"
"3604960","3606340"," The Fed won't pivot."
"3607140","3608200"," That's what he's telling you, right?"
"3609000","3618660"," And I promise you, if he doesn't pivot, I promise you that if he raises rates, a ton, and then"
"3618660","3626640"," we're going to crash the market, you know, you're going to see probably here now a 35% chance of"
"3626640","3630360"," here, and possibly even much lower, somewhere in here. "
"3630360","3633680"," I forgot exactly where it is, but then this one is the one that's way low down there."
"3635580","3639120"," This one's like right here or something, but you guys get what I'm saying, right?"
"3639560","3645360"," So when the Fed is telling you something right now, the bond market's saying, now we don't believe"
"3645360","3645560"," you."
"3647740","3652140"," Now, whether that's true or not, is left to be found out. "
"3656850","3662670"," And I think the key thing here would be to find out if the unemployment rate raises, if the"
"3662670","3664550"," unemployment rate rises, right?"
"3665550","3671930"," There's a fair chance of the Fed pivoting or pausing to ensure that that unemployment rate rises,"
"3672590","3675770"," and that inflation continues to go down."
"3676590","3678690"," It would make sense for the Fed to pivot."
"3695160","3700560"," Oh, I forgot to do, you're right, I forgot to do why you take the, why you take the TLT"
"3700560","3701440"," trade, I'll show that back. "
"3701660","3702540"," I'll show that to you right now."
"3703600","3705420"," Because I'll stem from why do you take TLT?"
"3706340","3707000"," I'll show it to you why."
"3708780","3710760"," I should have done that to begin with. "
"3713520","3717680"," So the question becomes why do you take the TLT trade as this happens?"
"3717680","3720740"," And I'll show you why."
"3722720","3728520"," When you think the market's going to burn, remove one drawing and one indicator."
"3734340","3735700"," Let me just second here. "
"3739780","3742700"," New pain, pain."
"3746400","3749260"," The Fed funds rate in place in an unemployment rate."
"3750140","3750480"," New pain. "
"3775540","3783040"," I don't know why I can't show, why maybe I should just show ultra bonds."
"3795420","3797780"," Can I show this on or how far back I can show this?"
"3797780","3805430"," I don't know how far back I can show this here."
"3806950","3808590"," Is that the futures?"
"3809430","3818910"," I don't want futures. "
"3821950","3823130"," Now I don't know what I'm doing."
"3826370","3827550"," I was to TLT."
"3841950","3844830"," This is the bet on TLT. "
"3855420","3859560"," Let me see if I can do a comparison of SPX."
"3869760","3873120"," So you can start to see the roll over an SPX right here, right?"
"3873300","3878680"," You can see the roll in SPX and you're saying we're going to dump and crash, right?"
"3879200","3885040"," What you wind up seeing is the cutting rates and you see TLT just blast off here."
"3885420","3885860"," You see that?"
"3887460","3899570"," And you see the same thing right here. "
"3900430","3909490"," You see the last leg down in the SPY and you see this slow grind higher in TLT."
"3910170","3914010"," And so the same thing is the bet in TLT."
"3916370","3928460"," So when you're looking at TLT now, this is"
"3928460","3936380"," where the bond market is saying, this right here is where the bond market is saying, hold on a"
"3936380","3936880"," second here. "
"3938800","3940200"," You guys can't see all that shit."
"3940520","3942100"," I got the fucking book map up."
"3942960","3943480"," Hold on here. "
"3979800","3987920"," That's fun."
"4023320","4028240"," That's fun."
"4029020","4037240"," This should be SPX, but you can actually see the roll over in the plateau, the pausing of rates and"
"4037240","4042060"," then the roll over of rate cuts. "
"4042460","4048800"," You see the initial push up sideways and this move up higher as the market begins to roll over."
"4049840","4055940"," You can see the same thing take place here with TLT as the market is rolling over an SPY."
"4057320","4060540"," And the peaking of rates and the roll over of rates. "
"4062860","4067400"," So if you're looking for TLT trade, feel like, oh, no, just sell the entire market down."
"4068120","4073560"," When you're looking at TLT, TLT should at some point pick this trade back up again."
"4074640","4077480"," If you believe that the market is going, isn't, hasn't bottom yet. "
"4077900","4083360"," If the SPX, if Q's, none of that stuff is bottom yet, you're going to expect the bond market to"
"4083360","4087440"," blast off into 2023, possibly even in 2024."
"4090360","4092500"," And you can see the bond market is saying it already."
"4093480","4103420"," If you look at HYG, you can see that risky bonds have already broken trend, right?"
"4104500","4109939"," You're going to expect risky bonds like HYG to continue to sell down as the market continues to"
"4109939","4112240"," sell down into next year. "
"4113180","4119840"," Any of these risky bonds, HYG, junk bonds should continue down, should break trend."
"4121140","4127260"," And actually, you would actually see a bottom down here and you're looking for whatever you see TLT"
"4127260","4127479"," bottom."
"4127700","4137479"," You're going to look for a bottom down here and you would not want to see HYG continue"
"4137479","4137760"," up. "
"4137760","4142160"," You want to see it continue down, but watch TLT continue higher."
"4142540","4144359"," You'll see a divergence in both of these."
"4144920","4146540"," You actually see it in the dollar as well. "
"4146680","4149560"," The dollar should continue down at the same time."
"4149880","4153660"," And that would be the decoupling of the market going down."
"4153920","4155580"," The dollar going down, risky. "
"4156060","4157439"," That's in the bottom market going down."
"4173890","4174490"," So, yeah."
"4192430","4193730"," Hey, you guys want to look at the MBI?"
"4218780","4220860"," I'm going to clear the chart of all its charts. "
"4220860","4227340"," Hold on a second here."
"4242650","4246570"," Looking to the fear and greed index, 40 out of 100, which indicates fear."
"4246950","4251090"," While the crypto fear and greed index at 29 out of 100, also indicating fear. "
"4265280","4266500"," Not quite there yet."
"4267480","4268100"," On market breath."
"4269640","4273800"," Still have bulls hiding out in utilities for right here. "
"4273800","4280580"," 36.7%. 33 are here."
"4280720","4281520"," It's consumer staples."
"4282240","4283280"," I feel what HLT is. "
"4285100","4288800"," You can see that we still have breath in the market down here."
"4290400","4292820"," Still not down at these levels down here."
"4292940","4294200"," You want to see these lower levels. "
"4294480","4298940"," So, you want to see us calm down just a little bit more, crying down here."
"4300080","4303340"," There is something positive about the market breath indicator though."
"4305380","4306920"," Hold on a second here. "
"4309340","4313160"," And that would be there is something positive on the market breath indicator typically."
"4313980","4315800"," We see these vicious lows."
"4316300","4321880"," When you see these vicious lows here in the beginning of the year, it broke trend, right?"
"4322100","4322680"," Vicks went up. "
"4323620","4325260"," We actually broke trend, Vicks went up."
"4327000","4330260"," You always say, why is Vicks not high?"
"4331580","4333740"," It's because we've traded in a zone, right?"
"4334440","4335860"," And no changes so far."
"4337720","4339180"," This is a trend, right?"
"4339820","4340740"," Trend all the way up here. "
"4341500","4342400"," Break that trend."
"4342820","4344780"," That's when Vicks goes up and trading in here."
"4345020","4346000"," We don't have any Vicks high, right?"
"4346140","4348080"," We're not going to see a high Vicks unless we break that trend. "
"4348280","4348660"," Does that make sense?"
"4349680","4350700"," Even if it's a sideways trend."
"4351760","4360140"," There is, this is showing you that there was accumulation back here in June and back here in"
"4360140","4360460"," October."
"4361480","4364880"," You can see breath already near the bottom. "
"4365580","4367340"," This is where the 52 week is, right?"
"4367600","4369740"," The terrorist says that I'm not optimistic about the positive."
"4370320","4371440"," The movie average is somewhere here."
"4371580","4374940"," The immediate future believes that military confrontation will go on. "
"4376100","4380500"," If we break below this weekly moving average, that would mean that all of this was, that was"
"4380500","4383260"," accumulated, right?"
"4383540","4388380"," If we start to sell that accumulation, that would bring new fear into the market."
"4388620","4398200"," This would actually be a repeat of January 7th of 2000 or 2022, January"
"4398200","4399620"," 4th or whatever that data was."
"4400200","4405240"," So it ended up seeing is violent moves down in our market just like this. "
"4406600","4408720"," You can see this move, this bloodbath down."
"4408720","4410180"," This was a huge move for us."
"4410640","4415560"," Another, well, not really a huge move, a little bit of consolidation move, but this is the second"
"4415560","4416320"," big one right here. "
"4416380","4421440"," This is really the two giant liquidation moments in our market."
"4422080","4425900"," So you'd be expecting something like this again if we break below the 52 week."
"4426960","4429060"," Though each time we broke, right?"
"4429780","4433200"," It was the same kind of a thing where you can kind of see where we come down, bounce back"
"4433200","4437460"," up, come down, bounce back up, and then we have that big move down again. "
"4438160","4443980"," So that doesn't mean you don't get relief rallies in here as we trade down."
"4444280","4445180"," The bull's had a case."
"4447160","4450720"," If the bull's had a case here, hang tight here. "
"4454820","4464270"," If the bull's had a case, nice little squeeze higher now to pivot."
"4465590","4475440"," If the bull's had a case here on the daily, you'd want to see that last little bit here,"
"4475440","4477160"," and then we start trading higher, right?"
"4480300","4483500"," Price momentum indicator though is telling you were still rolling over, right?"
"4484200","4486300"," So you're going to want to be looking for this kind of a move here."
"4486760","4490980"," If the bull's had a case saying, well, hey, Cap, they bought this market down here. "
"4491060","4492320"," We're going to trade it sideways now, Cap."
"4492760","4494580"," We're not going to break below the weekly moving average."
"4494580","4497940"," We're going to just stay in this trading range until they can dump it. "
"4498760","4502960"," They'll try to dump in January, March, late 2024, that kind of stuff."
"4503660","4508180"," There can be a case made for that if you look on, I think it's a weekly or monthly."
"4509020","4509480"," Yeah, it's weekly. "
"4510600","4518740"," If you look on this weekly chart, right, going back historically, other than this bloodbath back"
"4518740","4527060"," here in 2008 and even 2001, 2002, on a weekly perspective, we're looking to actually."
"4528580","4530040"," Just seeing a correction from the stories."
"4530220","4535640"," The area telling you French and German ministers regarding the US inflation reduction acts. "
"4535820","4539120"," It did actually come from their economy ministers as opposed to their finance ministers."
"4540940","4541380"," Right."
"4541600","4544220"," Try to tell you that we're trying to make a move higher here. "
"4545040","4547380"," Now, this is all over is what you're trying to tell me."
"4548180","4553720"," And so when we come into this weekly moving average, we're going to bounce off this and rocket ship"
"4553720","4553980"," off."
"4554180","4554600"," We've hit bottom. "
"4554960","4556200"," That's it."
"4556200","4556400"," We're going to get the cap."
"4556580","4558900"," We're going higher on a weekly. "
"4560040","4564540"," Yes, on a weekly, the market has been bought."
"4565840","4571580"," Unlike any of the time previously, you can see this last little capitulation movie went below here."
"4572540","4577800"," You can see with these June, July, and then, of course, in October, this bottom got bought. "
"4578980","4584040"," So the polls have a case to bottom down here."
"4584040","4584480"," They do."
"4588180","4591160"," Do the bears have a case to trade at the time of the weekly move average?"
"4591440","4592040"," Yes, they do. "
"4593560","4594660"," So you should see."
"4595580","4605480"," So if you have this, so your stance would be that any retracement that we see in the market, any"
"4605480","4612040"," retracement that we see in the market should still be met with a date with the weekly moving"
"4612040","4612660"," average."
"4613740","4620760"," So a bear is looking for just repositioning to short into the weekly moving average to get the"
"4620760","4625600"," market breath down to a bottom for a bull to feel like he wants to buy it or she wants"
"4625600","4626320"," to buy it or whatever. "
"4627540","4633940"," And if we break through there, that's where the bears would take on their uber bearishness that no"
"4633940","4638300"," way cap, we're going to take this down below, we're going to crash this market just like we did in"
"4638300","4640460"," 2007, 2008."
"4644300","4645640"," You could think of it like this."
"4645960","4654640"," If I walked into January 4th and I held a stock that cost me $100 and I sold it, right?"
"4655460","4656600"," Let's say I sold it right at $100. "
"4657400","4661980"," And we bloodbath it down to where that stock was then worth $50, right?"
"4662700","4664480"," And so I went back in and bought that stock at $50."
"4665440","4672460"," That stock goes up to like $55 or $16 in this bottoming process in June in October."
"4673500","4677920"," It goes back up to $16 and then it comes back down to that WMA and it's back at $50"
"4677920","4678520"," again. "
"4679600","4683720"," And remember I had originally sold it at $100 and we bought it at $50."
"4684560","4688820"," It's been repriced and now they're saying to you, well, we're going to reprice this once more."
"4689400","4691500"," We're going to make bottom of this stock $25. "
"4692340","4698900"," So I would then have to cut loose all that first buy that I bought into, that first dip buying"
"4698900","4705000"," dollar cost averaging that these banks bought into, these institutions."
"4707940","4715580"," So it's going to be a big, at the end of this down move, whenever we have that last capitulation"
"4715580","4725220"," moment where utilities, consumer staples, sells out, you're going to end up seeing the inflection"
"4725220","4727840"," point for the entire year for the SB 500."
"4732560","4733580"," Inflation reduction act. "
"4733900","4736100"," Yeah, it's not an inflation reduction act."
"4743550","4744030"," Yeah."
"4744250","4744410"," All right. "
"4744430","4744990"," So I'm going to take a break."
"4745530","4748970"," I have a meeting here coming up in the next half an hour."
"4749770","4750770"," I'll be back with you. "
"4750770","4757810"," I do want you to know that on a five minute chart, do you want you to see this on"
"4757810","4758630"," a five minute chart?"
"4764860","4766320"," See that blue line right there?"
"4766700","4770720"," I'm going to get rid of that one here, indicator, where we get moving out."
"4770860","4777350"," All you know I could do is just, we're going on here."
"4778450","4779270"," We'll do the 20. "
"4780610","4781650"," We'll make that blue."
"4784530","4785990"," I'm going to hide all these other ones."
"4787430","4788370"," See that right there?"
"4793420","4794780"," See that blue line right there?"
"4796200","4800000"," This should start coming up and this should start trading right up on that blue line right there. "
"4800200","4800220"," Okay."
"4803020","4805120"," You want to see that blue line hold right here?"
"4806020","4821750"," That's at a 3.83.03. You want to see a bounce on 3.03. You"
"4821750","4823390"," want to see that, okay?"
"4825090","4827030"," See that big blue line right there?"
"4827170","4829330"," This is the Jedi Marcus line right here."
"4907940","4908120"," Okay. "
"4908940","4908960"," All right."
"4909160","4909340"," All right."

"8937530","8941650"," And they're just coming into, I know they were using, I think they were using maker's mark."
"8942850","8945890"," I think they were, I forget which whiskey you. "
"8946110","8953630"," So when they first, when most distilleries create a company, they take like 10 years for them to"
"8953630","8958350"," bottle their whiskey at some point."
"8959170","8963250"," But I think they're right in that, right in that curve right now where all their whiskey is theirs."
"8968770","8969850"," Which Japanese whiskeys?"
"8970570","8971450"," Hold on, I'll tell you. "
"8972810","8973650"," There's a few of them."
"8973810","8974230"," Hold on one second."
"8977090","8979390"," One starts with a T, but hold on a second. "
"8980490","8981890"," I'll try to get you the exact ones."
"8983930","8985830"," That's like a, that's like a clear bottle with a white label on it."
"9005270","9008610"," I like Hibiki, H-I-B-I-K-I. "
"9016040","9018060"," And they're pretty, pretty cheap."
"9018300","9018900"," They have cheap bottles."
"9019820","9024460"," Tengaku, which is T-E-N-J-A-Q-U. "
"9032560","9035680"," Tokai T-O-K-I is good stuff too."
"9036580","9043720"," If you, if you have a, if you have a chance, go find yourself like a good liquor store."
"9058430","9059970"," And they're almost exact. "
"9060570","9067770"," Like if I poured you a glass, so some people are going to say, some people are going to say"
"9067770","9074370"," that it doesn't taste or people say things to you like, it's not real bourbon of course."
"9075230","9077530"," And it's a rip-off and that kind of stuff."
"9077810","9081290"," But I've drank a lot of, I've drank a lot of Pappy. "
"9081670","9085630"," Like, like Rifran Winkle, I've tasted tons of it."
"9086910","9090630"," And it's only through knowing people that have had access to it."
"9090770","9099730"," But regardless, some of these, some of these Japanese Bourbons, Japanese Whiskeys, if I poured it"
"9099730","9102590"," right next to a glass, you might. "
"9103110","9105370"," I'm like the, on the higher year stuff on rip."
"9105610","9109670"," It's like the Rifran Winkle stuff that's like 15, I think they have like 15 to 17 or 20."
"9110110","9115450"," Don't quote me in the exact years, but those taste like a, it tastes like you're, you're drinking a"
"9115450","9117290"," pine forest from Kentucky. "
"9117830","9122410"," You feel like you're sitting in a pine forest, drinking that stuff."
"9123250","9125410"," Let me see."
"9126070","9126490"," Oh, here we go. "
"9126550","9126610"," Yeah."
"9129630","9134630"," H-A-K-A-U-S-H-U is another one."
"9139810","9145470"," They make some bang and then let these bottles are like 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 10 bucks. "
"9145670","9147950"," I've seen some of them for like 10 bucks, 15 bucks."
"9148730","9150350"," And you couldn't tell the difference, I promise you."
"9155020","9155480"," Yeah. "
"9155620","9155640"," No."
"9155640","9155960"," No."
"9155960","9160900"," The industry minister says the, this deal will protect citizens and businesses from excessive gas"
"9160900","9161640"," price spikes. "
"9162100","9164820"," Actually, no, I actually know more than I should be letting out about this stuff."
"9165020","9165240"," So."
"9172260","9172900"," So. "
"9175360","9177720"," My, my, my, my profession, right?"
"9178100","9182320"," Do you have like a Michelin restaurant or James Beard restaurant or."
"9183680","9187560"," I don't know, like top 10 restaurant in the US on open table or."
"9187940","9194040"," Check industry minister says the cap will be triggered if the month ahead TTF price exceeds 180. "
"9194820","9197540"," Year-old megawatt hours for three days."
"9198860","9201560"," I would come help you to do what you do."
"9201900","9202180"," And so. "
"9203520","9208560"," If you sell so much whiskey from the, from the, from Ripley and Winkler company, well, if you sell."
"9209060","9212260"," I think it's Eagle Rare and I forget the other one is you get a, you get a, you can"
"9212260","9213220"," sign up for an allotment."
"9213980","9214260"," Okay. "
"9214340","9215560"," How much, how much whiskey you sell."
"9216960","9221760"," And so these are direct from, this is direct from the distillery."
"9222620","9228940"," None of this, none of this stuff came from like a package store or from a restaurant claiming it to"
"9228940","9229200"," be some. "
"9230700","9232540"," So you meet the distillers and stuff like that."
"9238000","9239200"," Yeah, total wine, man."
"9239720","9242020"," I think they've got a total wine in California too in LA. "
"9242240","9246200"," Check industry minister says that this is not a fixed cap but a dynamic one."
"9246380","9246400"," Yeah."
"9247680","9248400"," That's good shit. "
"9254860","9256680"," There's a lot of fake still even then too."
"9256780","9262360"," I shouldn't be saying that because there's still fakes even in the whiskey market."
"9263220","9267360"," I think there's a big bus down in, there's a huge bus down South Carolina wasn't there. "
"9268380","9272100"," Like maybe half a decade ago where they were pulling from the trucks."
"9274720","9276660"," People put relabel stuff they'll."
"9276800","9278100"," All right. "
"9278700","9278920"," Let's see."
"9279020","9279520"," I'm going to hold on a second."
"9279540","9280100"," I'm going to take a look here. "
"9284220","9284740"," Yeah, man."
"9284880","9285580"," You don't want to break below."
"9285740","9286280"," I'll tell you what. "
"9287220","9288480"," If you're not aware, right?"
"9289940","9291260"," Anything down below here."
"9291700","9293400"," This is all negative gamut down here."
"9294820","9296120"," So it'll get nasty. "
"9296820","9298300"," Like we break below right here."
"9299520","9301040"," This gets violent."
"9306580","9307700"," Down below here. "
"9308000","9313740"," Check industry minister says the price cap level is based on a daily LNG reference price."
"9313800","9314720"," This is premium."
"9315040","9315800"," So you can see. "
"9318280","9319700"," One second here."
"9323370","9325470"," And we've broken below at this point."
"9325850","9330490"," So if you're looking at, why is this not showing up here?"
"9333740","9334000"," Yeah. "
"9334080","9336020"," So we've broken below into negative gamma here."
"9338780","9340640"," And this is really bad."
"9341280","9346440"," So on SPX check industry minister says the cap will apply to month ahead, three months ahead and"
"9346440","9348100"," year ahead TTF contracts. "
"9349180","9351380"," So just so you know out there."
"9352320","9353920"," So SPX is the indicator for the spot."
"9354140","9359460"," This says the cap will apply to all gas trading hubs in the EU, but commission can choose to"
"9359460","9360180"," exclude some. "
"9362060","9364500"," So we're below negative gamma now on SPX."
"9366020","9367520"," It's not quite showing up on."
"9372390","9373690"," This is not zero gamma. "
"9373930","9374810"," This is zero gamma here."
"9375950","9378090"," And this is positive gamma here."
"9390200","9391620"," It's real bad. "
"9393140","9398580"," You're going to expect to fill this gap down here, which is pretty fucking low, man."
"9398580","9404800"," Seven right there."
"9413320","9414920"," This is not a good sign. "
"9415560","9417060"," If you're a bear, this is a very good sign."
"9425430","9427690"," With this SPX, you want to see that break right there."
"9428590","9429070"," No bueno. "
"9430890","9431850"," No bueno."
"9445950","9450430"," EU Simpson says this cap aims to take away the war premium on gas prices."
"9470660","9473240"," That's also where that 500 bid order was. "
"9477340","9478720"," The door is open."
"9478940","9479260"," Definitely."
"9479980","9481300"," There's just opened the door. "
"9486440","9490520"," EU Energy Commission says filling the gas storage for storage."
"9490720","9493000"," Storage is the way to be harder than this."
"9493140","9493900"," I like total one. "
"9499600","9501540"," Yeah, like a red hulk or a green hulk."
"9503480","9508700"," Yeah, you can see it's where negative gamma two are just squeezing right now."
"9508700","9509320"," Yeah. "
"9516000","9520900"," If you're not above the pivot here, well, if you're not above, this is where this is actual R1"
"9520900","9521320"," right here."
"9521340","9523140"," This is where positive gamma starts."
"9524300","9528620"," So, you know, seeing squeezes, new lows again, no different. "
"9539600","9544020"," I'm watching right now to see if 382 goes up in price, but I'm not seeing it."
"9544480","9547360"," Only 382 is still 59 cents on that bounce."
"9547540","9548060"," You should have seen. "
"9548580","9550940"," You should have seen a giant rip on 382."
"9551620","9557200"," EU Energy Commission says the deal includes safeguards in case the gas price cap causes an increase"
"9557200","9558300"," in margin calls."
"9570230","9571590"," Slow news day today. "
"9574610","9582270"," EU Energy Commission says the EU is ready to suspend the cap if regulators and analysts show that"
"9582270","9583850"," risk outweigh the benefits."
"9584410","9586890"," You know, do is who tipped over here earlier?"
"9588210","9592790"," Magnus, you know, do is I'll get a bottle of whiskey."
"9593270","9596570"," I'll get a bottle of Japanese whiskey and we'll drink it. "
"9600770","9604750"," You got to your own gem language in there, unicorns and shit."
"9610000","9615620"," I was reading the, I was reading the story about, I don't know."
"9615780","9616800"," I'll talk about it later. "
"9617640","9618720"," It's reading the story."
"9619340","9621800"," They were telling saying, don't believe, don't try to time the market."
"9621960","9623640"," I'm like, you can fucking time the market pretty well. "
"9631970","9633510"," Like, don't try to time bottoms."
"9633610","9634410"," I was like, that's a lie."
"9636210","9639790"," I was like, if that employment goes to the fucking moon, we'll time that bottom easily. "
"9652880","9655180"," It looks like a squeeze only, by the way."
"9658580","9659680"," Low volume squeeze."
"9663170","9666350"," You can see the volume is high as fuck right now. "
"9667090","9674290"," Like low volume days on the dome, you'll end up seeing like 50,000 contracts, 60,000 contracts,"
"9674370","9675090"," shit like that."
"9675090","9679510"," You're seeing like 268,000 right now."
"9680190","9687690"," So this is just, this is more, more horse trading for institutions. "
"9694320","9696140"," Mike Wilson is now calling for 3000."
"9698860","9700780"," I don't get this reason that wealthy."
"9703820","9704620"," I will, Magnus. "
"9704880","9705200"," I'll have it."
"9706660","9707360"," I'll have it."
"9708160","9709120"," I'll bring it. "
"9709120","9711500"," I'll go pick one up tonight and bring it back for the stream this week."
"9711720","9713280"," We'll drink it on Christmas Eve or something."
"9714060","9715360"," What a day before, whatever the fuck it is. "
"9716520","9718260"," I'll grab a bottle for you, man."
"9718420","9719020"," We'll drink it together."
"9720960","9723760"," Or I can't drink it with you, but I'll drink it with you. "
"9724180","9725320"," I'll drink it on air."
"9729720","9732580"," I don't get this research because I know what they're never right."
"9732720","9735500"," Anyways, I mean, what did they do that?"
"9735700","9737100"," What were their predictions last year?"
"9737500","9738640"," They were wrong, right?"
"9739000","9739980"," They're always fucking wrong. "
"9742540","9743960"," I feel like it's always a narrative."
"9744200","9745320"," They're always just trying to sell a narrative."
"9745840","9746860"," Are we selling right now?"
"9747220","9747960"," I predict 3000. "
"9751980","9754060"," Mike Wilson said he was buying the market, right?"
"9754280","9757500"," Just not too long ago."
"9758720","9760380"," We even get to 430."
"9760720","9761680"," I think he said 430. "
"9762060","9765420"," We got to like 415, 410, 414, to be exact."
"9766540","9768300"," And I think he was selling before we got to 414."
"9769300","9770700"," So he probably got hurt on that. "
"9775880","9776540"," Yeah, it does."
"9776700","9777640"," I agree with that, Winky."
"9778640","9780280"," It becomes self-fulfilling prophecy. "
"9783780","9787380"," He was talking to always the other day."
"9787380","9790960"," And he was like, some of the details of EU's gas price and its feasibility."
"9791640","9794020"," But says the price cap risks financial stability. "
"9795180","9795960"," Somebody definitely."
"9796280","9799880"," So do you guys know when we went to 414, right?"
"9800980","9807060"," You probably have a short, probably have a large institution with a large short position with a"
"9807060","9808080"," stop loss on it."
"9809300","9815500"," And when it cranked higher, they got, they got jacked over big time. "
"9815500","9816860"," Probably took a huge hit."
"9817160","9819400"," No one talked about that in the news."
"9819620","9820940"," Like, who got hurt in that trade hire?"
"9829060","9831200"," He claimed which, no, he was a bull. "
"9831640","9833540"," So like somewhere in here, hold on."
"9833760","9836820"," I says it will assess whether it can continue to operate."
"9836900","9840420"," He was a bull on what we marked as the TTF gas hub from the Netherlands. "
"9840820","9842640"," He was a bull on that run until he got up there."
"9842720","9844480"," And then once we got up there, he said I'm a seller now."
"9844480","9845540"," He turned like mission. "
"9845620","9848140"," He says only one member state voted against the cap."
"9848560","9851820"," There was a Monday, like a Monday or Tuesday sort of like into Friday."
"9852280","9856300"," He had like a couple interviews where he was like, we're long until it gets overly hot. "
"9856600","9860620"," I think he even said at one point, one of his interviews 430 area."
"9860960","9866220"," And then as soon as we went up like 400 or something, he was like, he came out on a"
"9866220","9867460"," Monday and was like, we're selling here."
"9868060","9869320"," And we slammed up to 414. "
"9869320","9872440"," And people were one."
"9872580","9873520"," Nobody's talked about it."
"9873660","9875820"," Who got hurt in that in that short trade?"
"9875980","9877140"," Which institution got hurt?"
"9883020","9885020"," He was claiming that he was a bull to 414. "
"9885520","9888100"," That's I think I remember exact."
"9888440","9889840"," I think he wasn't a bull at that point."
"9890560","9892740"," I'll look it up because who was it?"
"9892900","9898760"," Jesus or some Wall Street Jesus had every time he was long short or whatever. "
"9898760","9900020"," I think Wall Street Jesus."
"9901460","9902740"," Someone tracks it out there."
"9904840","9906380"," You just trade this up, Ryan?"
"9907440","9908340"," This little jump. "
"9923230","9925630"," He said that I'm on CNBC on Thursday."
"9927630","9931550"," Because I remember he had two or three interviews."
"9931550","9933850"," One in Bloomberg where he said, we're long this market. "
"9934170","9937230"," And then I remember like a Monday he came out and said, we're not long any longer."
"9939410","9940950"," We talked about it, I think it's stream."
"9941430","9942130"," And then we started selling. "
"9945610","9946790"," Yeah, we're telling Mike Wilson."
"9951430","9952910"," I haven't done shit today."
"9955450","9956670"," I haven't done nothing. "
"9963460","9964400"," I'll be honest with him."
"9964480","9965020"," Make my eyes bleed."
"9976930","9977450"," He's better. "
"9977610","9978550"," He's a short again right now."
"9981300","9981920"," Yeah, I'm just waiting."
"9982880","9986200"," There's a retracement trade here. "
"9986560","9987540"," We all know there is."
"9988160","9991300"," I think even bears know that there's a retracement trade."
"9992820","9995680"," But I mean, I would love to take it from right here. "
"9999300","10001400"," I would love this like sell down."
"10003060","10004560"," That'd be a gorgeous trade."
"10004720","10005380"," It's somewhere in here. "
"10005640","10007580"," You could probably get a, probably take it all spread here."
"10008440","10009480"," And it probably print."
"10010540","10015360"," I don't think we're blasting through 375 in any way, shape or form. "
"10016540","10017720"," I think we're going below 375."
"10018300","10021260"," I just don't think we're doing it like today or tomorrow."
"10022120","10023800"," Unless we get a retracement, I'd like to see. "
"10025380","10027420"," I'd like to see it touch and then come up."
"10028760","10031900"," Fill the, fill the higher gap and then come back down and blast through and."
"10033320","10036900"," Ripped down to like 350 or something, 365, 360. "
"10050070","10050950"," All right."
"10051630","10052110"," I'll be back."
"10052110","10056030"," I'm about to call a guy at the call about these indicators. "
"10057050","10058230"," You guys are going to get them."
"10058430","10060990"," So I think I can get the discord indicators too."
"10061290","10066170"," So I'm hoping that I can get a bot for discord. "
"10067350","10071150"," Where you can find out the gamma levels for each ticker."
"10071310","10073430"," I don't know if I can get each ticker, but I think I can."
"10073670","10078550"," The major ones like Apple and Amazon and Tesla. "
"10079950","10083510"," At least like the major fang man stuff and then all the indexes."
"10084110","10085330"," And you can go and just plot."
"10085470","10088250"," You should be able to just like plug in the ticker and then. "
"10089530","10091830"," It'll compute all that stuff for you every day."
"10091830","10096970"," So you'll get a chart and a distribution of puts and calls as well."
"10100530","10101530"," Oh, Dan Niles. "
"10101530","10108380"," Oh, so bag help bag holder Bobby knows exactly how this goes."
"10109060","10110700"," You're correct bag holder Bobby."
"10111040","10115260"," Dan Niles comes out on CNBC at like four o'clock in the afternoon. "
"10115260","10115780"," He says."
"10116880","10120420"," We're short this market, but we're long right now because we're in oversold conditions."
"10120860","10122200"," That's exactly what he says every time. "
"10122860","10124420"," And that's usually when the MPI is."
"10125300","10127700"," Like pin max needles down low."
"10129560","10131920"," It is Dan Niles that says that right. "
"10133380","10138760"," Yeah, so I'm working on that with some developers."
"10140560","10144740"," And I'll try to put the bot inside of the discord for you and then it'll be on the website."
"10146220","10146900"," That kind of stuff. "
"10148500","10151440"," So we make that full call right now and I'll get back with you guys."
"10152160","10153500"," If there's a large."
"10153740","10156020"," I mean, I don't know if if I see anything at all that. "
"10158900","10161700"," You know, we're still teeing off the moving averages here, right?"
"10161700","10163080"," You can see that's what we're doing."
"10164540","10166120"," Camp here teed right off."
"10167380","10169040"," You know, none of this is good. "
"10170060","10173680"," If the moving averages come down here, the scary part."
"10173860","10178040"," Well, if you're a bullet scary part is the moving averages, just keep it coming down here."
"10179020","10182240"," We should get some, you know, some more negative gamma moves down below. "
"10182980","10183460"," So."
"10185080","10188840"," Anything down below this negative gamma line right here is S one area is."
"10191120","10192540"," No bueno. "
"10194940","10197500"," I'll be back."
"10252290","10334710"," The Kremlin"
"10334710","10339250"," says EU gas price cap is a tack on market pricing and is unacceptable."
"10832820","10835920"," So just be aware right now you're watching a bounce, right?"
"10836300","10839120"," Just look on the book map and you can see that. "
"10840640","10846380"," Still have more sours than buyers right now."
"10846520","10848320"," So just take this as a word of caution."
"10850740","10854060"," This is more like a squeeze here so far. "
"10854200","10854360"," Okay."
"10855360","10856640"," This trade higher right now."
"10863320","10868600"," Still still selling in the strength would be the way that you described this right here. "
"10875900","10877540"," Do you see that in the dome?"
"10880180","10885420"," You can see down here you still have more sellers than buyers right now."
"10891450","10895070"," And we're in negative gamma so you can see the pivot here."
"10895190","10896410"," This is zero gamma right here. "
"10896730","10898170"," This is like bad, bad gamma."
"10900510","10903110"," This is zero gamma where the pivot is."
"10904710","10908410"," So you see this nice squeeze higher but you see that there's still sellers right now. "
"10909830","10912730"," Indicative of still being a negative gamma at the moment."
"10929820","10930480"," Thank you."
"10930660","10932220"," Are you fucking spamming the fucking. "
"10932640","10934100"," Are you spamming the chat bro?"
"10934940","10944440"," I can't listen to CNBC anymore."
"10944580","10945120"," That shit's like."
"10947120","10949060"," I remember the day I gave it up. "
"10949140","10952640"," I was like I'll never ever fucking listen to this dog shit ever again."
"10952640","10953700"," I can't do CNBC."
"10954800","10955880"," I just can't. "
"10955980","10957160"," It's like brain rot."
"10969260","10970540"," Let's just mess it with the wiki."
"10976680","10978240"," Wiki is the fucking man. "
"10980080","10981720"," CNBC man I can't do it."
"10981880","10982920"," I can't listen to CNBC."
"10983480","10984280"," I just can't do it. "
"10984860","10985360"," Can't bro."
"10985980","10986660"," Can't do CNBC."
"10988800","10990720"," I can barely get through it. "
"10990820","10991200"," Like the Fox."
"10991480","10993500"," I hate Fox News."
"10993500","10994240"," It's not so bad. "
"10994740","10996400"," Some of the Bloomberg stuff's pretty good."
"10997700","10999980"," I guess there is some good stuff on CNBC."
"11000580","11002480"," I think it's the week he's talked about the options show. "
"11002840","11004240"," There's a couple shows that are pretty cool."
"11005180","11011060"," There's some options show that isn't it on it like three 30 or two 30 is an option show on"
"11011060","11011480"," or there was."
"11012060","11013120"," Every day of the week I think. "
"11013680","11015140"," And they would like pump their own positions."
"11015180","11017140"," They'd be like I'm in."
"11017860","11021080"," They'd be like I'm in snow calls for next Wednesday. "
"11021080","11026620"," I just got in them and then you watch snow go up like 3% to the next five minutes."
"11030200","11031420"," That's a fair point too."
"11031560","11034540"," Ocean fantasy saying they have a complete idea was going on. "
"11034640","11035600"," They just don't want to release it."
"11035740","11036240"," I agree with that."
"11036380","11040240"," I've made money off of them fucking up and saying shit. "
"11040360","11041200"," They weren't supposed to stay."
"11041500","11043160"," I have made money from them doing that."
"11044100","11044880"," Everyone's no auto. "
"11045120","11045800"," Let's something slip."
"11052440","11053740"," I agree with that ocean fantasy."
"11056260","11058660"," I have made money from them slipping. "
"11059780","11062840"," Like in broadcast saying we shouldn't have said that."
"11066920","11070540"," Do you remember that shit they would remember they would pump their own cause it was like 2 30 in"
"11070540","11070880"," the afternoon."
"11071680","11074500"," I think it was like 2 33 o'clock. "
"11074500","11075920"," Maybe they would come on every day."
"11076300","11077760"," Mark would be selling off."
"11078560","11081880"," You know that and we're in the bull market and it would like sell off. "
"11082560","11083980"," We're like pump for the home morning."
"11084520","11087860"," We go sideways and we go down into like 2 30 in the afternoon."
"11088400","11090540"," Those guys would come on and just drop their own stocks. "
"11090800","11094000"," We run away where the bottom is and you just watch them fucking rip."
"11096300","11097100"," Totally legal."
"11105040","11107080"," It was always like some kind of a thing like. "
"11109000","11111340"," You know they got out of those calls right afterwards."
"11127660","11128040"," Yeah."
"11128040","11128760"," Yeah, you remember that show?"
"11130840","11131910"," I forget who it was. "
"11133160","11134660"," I forget what the name it was."
"11134820","11136780"," The guy was on it who had like the."
"11137340","11138160"," He looked here. "
"11138300","11140020"," He's like the bro bro college guy."
"11140260","11140860"," I forget his name."
"11143580","11144080"," He does. "
"11144080","11147700"," He does like the footballs in the back of his office and all that shit and like two and three"
"11147700","11153980"," of his buddies would sit there and pump a bunch of fucking pump and dump stocks on CNBC."
"11154740","11155620"," That shit's crazy."
"11159900","11161460"," All right, I got to get back to it. "
"11161860","11164560"," I'm talking to some developers and I have no idea what I'm talking about."
"11165300","11172580"," I'm like trying to relate like a layman asking a layman asking a dropper to do certain things is no"
"11172580","11172900"," fun."
"11183650","11185190"," I don't remember. "
"11185310","11185830"," I don't remember."
"11185930","11186390"," Yeah, Josh."
"11186630","11187590"," The guy's name was Josh. "
"11188530","11189410"," His show."
"11189710","11191470"," Whoever his show was on."
"11192070","11193470"," His show is on. "
"11193870","11195170"," That's the show I'm talking about."
"11195250","11199210"," He come on like he just pumped a couple of dog shit stocks that have been bleeding off."
"11200330","11204230"," People like I've been calls on these things and then boom, you just watch it turn. "
"11206950","11207970"," His name is Josh."
"11211390","11220960"," I don't think so."
"11221200","11222500"," I don't think Bloomberg does that, but. "
"11223960","11226720"," Bloomberg, you can usually get some good interviews on Bloomberg."
"11227240","11228520"," You can usually get like a."
"11229560","11234580"," Like you get like a more not in depth, but where you get like a couple of stupid comments for"
"11234580","11234980"," somebody."
"11236220","11240880"," Announcing their positions like some hedge fund announcing their positions like Bloomberg. "
"11240880","11241700"," You can usually get."
"11242720","11245700"," A heavy hitter that come talk for 15, 20 minutes."
"11251720","11254600"," Yeah, Kramer's Kramer is just a meme now, man. "
"11256740","11260800"," Yeah, I saw that Christian about China experiencing COVID meltdowns."
"11261740","11262680"," I saw that shit."
"11266560","11268340"," This is productive right here. "
"11268820","11270780"," It was very productive."
"11272380","11274240"," Still squeeze though still selling."
"11278200","11280380"," Like I don't even know what to. "
"11280620","11282260"," So I was trading when."
"11283240","11284740"," I believe it or not."
"11285060","11286080"," I was trading when. "
"11287420","11288700"," John Stewart."
"11289860","11290060"," Ripped."
"11291420","11293960"," Kramer on his show the daily show. "
"11294580","11295780"," I was trading then."
"11296700","11297840"," I remember that."
"11298940","11300460"," I remember that fucking meltdown. "
"11307120","11310000"," I remember that time at that time."
"11310620","11314960"," Kramer pulled a lot of weight in the market or at least."
"11318520","11321400"," Up until that point, that's when he first lost his. "
"11325180","11326260"," Like he he lost."
"11327140","11331180"," Like the first time Kramer Kramer lost respectability was definitely."
"11332380","11334980"," During that time period and then John Stewart had him on. "
"11335000","11335780"," He lost his credibility."
"11337200","11340320"," And then like the rise of the retailers."
"11342140","11343680"," I shouldn't say the rise of the retail. "
"11343840","11351380"," The real rise of the retailers was in the dot."
"11359020","11362200"," I remember that time."
"11363100","11365600"," He was he tried to make himself out to be if it's ever. "
"11365760","11366560"," It's ever going to get bad."
"11366700","11367160"," I'll tell you."
"11369400","11370940"," Of course he went down the. "
"11371100","11371760"," The whore hole."
"11379020","11380640"," You want some pools of blood up here."
"11381900","11383680"," You want some pools of blood up here. "
"11386000","11388700"," I'm just seeing comments from ECB governing council member."
"11388840","11393340"," And as they speak on German TV saying we'll take some time to return to 2% inflation."
"11395670","11396850"," There is a terrible. "
"11399190","11400150"," That one hurt."
"11401230","11401850"," That was the."
"11406570","11407130"," Terrible. "
"11412750","11413870"," That terrible."
"11419830","11424570"," He's not like a Kramer as much as everyone else is like he is like the only one trying."
"11426550","11428270"," Yeah, if there was a he welcome. "
"11432780","11434380"," And the Jerry buzz went rogue."
"11442980","11443580"," There's a."
"11445520","11446420"," I don't know."
"11446740","11448840"," I mean the one thing I like about Kramer is. "
"11450180","11453520"," The one thing I'll say that I like about Kramer is he's the only."
"11454640","11457940"," Which I don't know if we keep saying this or not, but."
"11459360","11463620"," If you're a young trader, he's the only one speaking to you as a young trader. "
"11463940","11465360"," Nobody else out there is right."
"11465780","11466320"," Think about."
"11466920","11468520"," Is there any other. "
"11469440","11469960"," Host."
"11471200","11473460"," On CNBC that talks to a young trader."
"11473820","11475200"," He's probably the only one right. "
"11475200","11477880"," I don't think there's anybody out there that."
"11478780","11483360"," Some of those guys point blank say fuck retail traders as a host."
"11485240","11488260"," Especially young ones like if you're young here young retail trader. "
"11489140","11491780"," You just look that as you know piece of shit."
"11493580","11495920"," Stop stop eating your avocado toast."
"11496700","11498380"," Get a job at Starbucks. "
"11500080","11500640"," Bootstraps."
"11504910","11505490"," Blood."
"11505730","11507030"," Red blood. "
"11509050","11511050"," Pools of blood for the bulls."
"11514010","11516550"," There's AMC Christmas spirit rally coming."
"11517190","11517690"," I don't know. "
"11517830","11521890"," AMC and GME seem like they've been trading right along with the major markets."
"11523030","11523990"," Just edging everyone."
"11527650","11530890"," This isn't looking pretty is it just looks like a short squeeze. "
"11532010","11533070"," It's all it is."
"11533770","11535050"," You want to get these lower levels."
"11548690","11550290"," You want to take a look at Apple real quick we can. "
"11551030","11551230"," Hold on."
"11563910","11565150"," Let's take a look around the market."
"11568120","11569200"," You want to see a return. "
"11570240","11572380"," So book map doesn't look like returning but."
"11573660","11576200"," Let's start with book map or case here at home right now."
"11577080","11579460"," Book map you can see we have more sellers than buyers. "
"11580180","11581780"," We are below negative gap."
"11582000","11583260"," Well negative gamma not."
"11583840","11586200"," Not really nasty negative gamma yet. "
"11587500","11590480"," This is where nasty of negative gamma is not negative gammas."
"11590780","11592060"," This is zero gamma right here."
"11592680","11593420"," It's still negative. "
"11593420","11597320"," That means we're you know since the beginning of the day we've sold off right."
"11598100","11603520"," So off the tee sold it down one more time and they're going to expect if you're a bear."
"11604080","11606020"," We're going to grab these moving averages again. "
"11607640","11613200"," And try to get underneath right to get down to that three seventy three three seventy five."
"11615480","11618300"," You can see we have more sellers so any kind of strength right here."
"11619300","11621520"," You want to see more buyers than sellers. "
"11624520","11628760"," We're not seeing that so these are all check marks for the bears."
"11630700","11632100"," We'll take a look around the market."
"11636340","11638360"," So we'll look at NDX next. "
"11641720","11643220"," Down 122 points."
"11651740","11652260"," Right."
"11653500","11655240"," NDX doesn't look healthy does it. "
"11655440","11657100"," You want to talk about Apple down here."
"11660100","11661300"," You guys like trend lines."
"11661580","11662480"," I like trend lines too. "
"11662780","11663600"," Can't say I don't."
"11664740","11667640"," We'll put a trend line in here but we know where real buyers are."
"11668420","11668860"," Right. "
"11669060","11670280"," We know real buyers are down here."
"11671400","11673200"," We know real buyers are down here."
"11674380","11679000"," We know that real buyers are probably you know somewhere in here. "
"11680800","11682900"," But there's still room to go as the point."
"11684440","11688220"," That there's a lot of room here that you could go before you get real support."
"11688940","11695000"," This probably coincides with four seventy three somewhere down in here. "
"11696140","11698060"," Four seventy three is probably right there."
"11703000","11704980"," So tall smaller time frame."
"11707400","11710020"," You know you'd really like to buy this at least right. "
"11710240","11713060"," This probably eleven thousand thirty four."
"11713500","11716720"," That's not a hundred points down that we could go on Nasdaq."
"11718220","11719720"," Probably another hundred points. "
"11721140","11725400"," We're at a hundred twenty for a minus two fifty on the day to be pretty brutal right."
"11728140","11731640"," So you know at least Nasdaq it looks okay."
"11733540","11735700"," Enter day trader some could go lower. "
"11736760","11739400"," You know cool cool eleven thousand down here."
"11740280","11741760"," This is pretty much."
"11744660","11749600"," But relation to the spies probably with that three seventy three is down here. "
"11750880","11752880"," So I don't know you want to buy a dip."
"11753120","11754180"," You could."
"11756340","11757780"," We did it down here here. "
"11758760","11762480"," We got a dip by but it was down that by zone two right we caught that up."
"11766520","11771360"," Still risk not risky but call spread would be nice because you could capture this."
"11772700","11774620"," At least last risky. "
"11780840","11784180"," Take a look at Dixie you see how yeah and you can see Dixie."
"11785300","11787980"," Dixie's looking bullish but I want to warn you."
"11790860","11792460"," I need to warn you that. "
"11793880","11795400"," I had this here."
"11796780","11798420"," But I'm going to change this here."
"11800060","11804120"," I'm going to warn you that anything below this level here. "
"11805540","11807900"," It's probably going to be."
"11810620","11813940"," Yeah I might have that wrong."
"11824010","11826370"," This is June this is October. "
"11829970","11832530"," Yeah like."
"11832530","11832950"," Yeah."
"11832950","11839170"," Be careful of a decoupling of the dollar. "
"11839410","11843710"," There's a there's a part I posted about this in the summer I think."
"11844070","11844590"," I think."
"11846230","11849310"," Sator was talking about this I made a post this summer saying. "
"11850970","11852570"," You can see a recovery."
"11853910","11854850"," In Dixie."
"11855710","11860250"," And then you'll see a you'll see a you get too low and it becomes. "
"11861730","11862350"," Decoupled."
"11863890","11867770"," From the stock market we'll do is we'll look at."
"11871590","11875930"," Now hold on give me a second work you know it will come but we'll do right now hold on. "
"11880270","11882210"," You want to be careful with the."
"11886180","11886980"," The second here."
"11898440","11902860"," I want you to see something here okay. "
"11902860","11907200"," It shows to."
"11912280","11917800"," Okay so I want you to be aware that there can be a decoupling."
"11928250","11929070"," See where. "
"11931110","11933410"," Serious see this decoupling of Dixie."
"11935170","11939610"," Starts to sell off it's on a high right I want you to see this specifically okay."
"11940410","11942730"," So Dixie is on a high right here over time. "
"11943910","11944470"," And."
"11947860","11948800"," Kind of see."
"11951840","11956480"," It's higher highs higher highs higher highs and you break trend right. "
"11958660","11960640"," We've seen this recently happen."
"11963320","11965120"," Going to see that right there okay."
"11966120","11969480"," So we're trending up trending up trending up and you see this break. "
"11971420","11974500"," And I want you to be concerned about that at least."
"11978100","11979620"," You can't see it there."
"11981000","11982540"," I know you can see it in here. "
"11984140","11985620"," Right in this last little bit."
"11989970","11994190"," We're rolling over and there goes down there too but the specific move right here."
"11994830","11995750"," I was concerned about. "
"11995750","12001770"," And see the divergence already in Dixie right here."
"12007950","12010150"," And you can see that divergence right there."
"12010370","12013110"," But divergence where they start to both drop at the same time. "
"12013750","12015970"," And so you're seeing a divergence still like so."
"12018510","12023130"," The stock market hasn't gone down yet right to match this down move in Dixie."
"12023790","12027550"," And so I point to you is if you start to see Dixie really falling here. "
"12028770","12033450"," Is this now becoming a lead indicator of a fall in SPX."
"12034470","12035630"," Because the point I'm trying to make."
"12037190","12039530"," So how do we how do we look at that. "
"12042310","12043710"," Right here right where we are."
"12044430","12046370"," So you kind of don't want to see."
"12058060","12063280"," You don't want to see like SPX holding on or spy holding on and you start to see this kind"
"12063280","12063620"," of nonsense. "
"12065640","12069300"," You start seeing this nonsense and spies not going up."
"12071420","12075500"," You're going to expect spy to actually fall in line with Dixie at some point."
"12075660","12078840"," So be careful of this decoupling with Dixie. "
"12079780","12083620"," So is Dixie positive right now."
"12085600","12089040"," I would say that this the only reason you can use Dixie at this point."
"12090060","12093740"," Because as a bearish indicator if you start to break down here right. "
"12094420","12098780"," And you see spy not going up this is then going to imply that spies."
"12099760","12105800"," I'm going to start crashing or you know just like a localized 5% something like that 10%."
"12107400","12110580"," So I would stop using Dixie where it is currently. "
"12111680","12114640"," As a bullish indicator on the stock market."
"12119880","12121080"," With the VIX."
"12124920","12126500"," And we deleted all the VIX. "
"12203260","12204140"," 21."
"12208580","12210420"," So back in 2021."
"12241570","12243890"," You're going to expect this to get bought right now right. "
"12244090","12245750"," We're still rolling the market over."
"12252280","12253460"," Thumbar is down there."
"12254840","12256060"," Thumbar is down there. "
"12257340","12258540"," Thumbar is down there."
"12260300","12261320"," Sold that off."
"12337330","12338250"," Thumbar is down there. "
"12338250","12339630"," 18 dollars way down there."
"12362280","12364260"," Oil prices extend their gains."
"12364600","12385870"," US crude rising $2 to a session higher of around $76.41. Buyers. "
"12386550","12387430"," Sellers though."
"12426400","12427440"," Yes, Trent man."
"12427900","12428960"," I don't know about right here. "
"12429140","12435480"," This is 21.11. It's in that 55 cents down."
"12442080","12444200"," Looking for a bounce down below here."
"12445160","12445820"," And HYG. "
"12454540","12456620"," TLT probably find a bounce down here."
"12462960","12464100"," I'm not seeing a lot man."
"12464280","12466340"," The market's not really saying oh hell of a lot right now. "
"12466360","12466880"," I promise you."
"12468600","12470620"," Chan K starting to break below here."
"12471960","12478800"," A whole lot of dog shit. "
"12489090","12491130"," It looks it looks like a German economy."
"12491330","12495350"," Minister Habek says that Germany and I are still skeptical on the gas price mechanism."
"12500350","12501990"," It doesn't look like bottom. "
"12504000","12507260"," Probably the best tell right now is NASDAQ."
"12509620","12510780"," NDX is the tell."
"12514740","12515740"," Where's NDX?"
"12521350","12522690"," Because NDX, okay. "
"12524230","12528410"," So there's 11,077 on NASDAQ, right?"
"12528610","12535950"," We're just talking about, you know, you can see this grind down here, right?"
"12538910","12541830"," I kind of want to see at least this in here."
"12544130","12546430"," I get a touch of 11,000 be nice."
"12546430","12555800"," I kind of want to see that get a reaction trade down here. "
"12558240","12560360"," I kind of want to see that right there."
"12568840","12571620"," Even if you get this reaction trade down here."
"12573220","12576240"," You know, you're still looking for it to be sold at some point. "
"12576600","12579780"," So we know there's sellers right here."
"12579900","12581280"," There's a gap to be filled up here."
"12582460","12585440"," See this gap back here needs to be filled. "
"12586680","12592060"," But you got sellers that are, these are all sellers right here."
"12594260","12596160"," Sold it down, right?"
"12596940","12597640"," Sold it down again."
"12604440","12607240"," And there's some sneaky sellers down here too, right here. "
"12614220","12619220"," I'm going to assume that they're going to try to, you know, sell this down and get that last little"
"12619220","12619460"," bit."
"12619460","12622880"," So when you make it a pump right now, then slam it down."
"12632000","12637860"," I know you want to fill this gap up here, but this, I think that was the positive today, right?"
"12638080","12638480"," Fill the gap. "
"12639980","12642100"," If you don't fill the gap, might as well come down."
"12644220","12645980"," Fill the gap on SPX on spy."
"12649280","12653280"," Be wary of, be wary of this in here. "
"12658480","12661660"," Be wary of a reverse little 11, 195, 56."
"12670320","12671960"," You can see this big buy right here."
"12672000","12672700"," It didn't do shit. "
"12673480","12674660"," Selling in the strength band."
"12674920","12675320"," That's what it is."
"12676120","12677800"," Any kind of strength sell into it. "
"12678000","12679380"," Any kind of strength sell into it."
"12680260","12681100"," See right here, right?"
"12681400","12682520"," Buyers came in, bought it up."
"12683720","12684400"," The 16th. "
"12684880","12686480"," And just strength came in selling."
"12686860","12686880"," Boom."
"12688500","12689720"," Put down here in the volume. "
"12690020","12691640"," It's all sellers, sellers, sellers."
"12701400","12703560"," So this does not look healthy to me."
"12706730","12707730"," I can be wrong here. "
"12708170","12708750"," You know, I'm wrong."
"12709190","12709850"," I'm not always right."
"12711830","12713690"," This looks like it's teen off to go down. "
"12721430","12722710"," It's really shit."
"12724710","12725510"," It's not productive."
"12725990","12728450"," I mean, if you're a bow, I guess I'm speaking more to the bulls. "
"12729090","12731970"," If you squeeze higher here, it's just a squeeze."
"12732510","12733190"," It's not productive."
"12750470","12751130"," What are you?"
"12751230","12751790"," Where are you getting?"
"12752030","12756830"," You're getting hit with EMC bots in the, in the discord winky or inside the. "
"12757750","12758910"," Inside the chat here."
"12763310","12766070"," You're getting hit by AMC bots inside of the discord."
"12770220","12770720"," Winky. "
"12772640","12774220"," Doing a band that fucking word."
"12774220","12774360"," card."
"12776640","12777780"," They keep coming back. "
"12778080","12778860"," All right, hold on a second."
"12779900","12781460"," I'll fix that shit right now."
"12784400","12786420"," Do you know what the exact words they're using?"
"12786720","12787020"," What's the exact?"
"12787500","12788760"," Are they just saying AMC?"
"12794920","12799700"," Like just the acronym AMC or they do have $1 signed to?"
"12803390","12808430"," I've got sub only flipped on. "
"12811090","12813310"," Don't worry, I'll just fucking ban the word."
"12814890","12818610"," I think I can."
"12832180","12843720"," Is it saying, is it inside of the"
"12843720","12843920"," word?"
"12844580","12845320"," Let's make it easy. "
"12849080","12850520"," I don't want to be in the word, but I will."
"12850680","12853960"," I don't mind people talking about AMC, but if you're going to come in and fucking,"
"12866500","12875220"," seriously, not this"
"12875220","12877620"," one here."
"12893800","12896120"," I thought I saw someone ask about AMC. "
"12897680","12899780"," I think I said you're not going to get an AMC."
"12900440","12902400"," AMC is just pumping with spy."
"12903100","12907120"," So there's no reason to think that. "
"12908440","12910040"," I think it correlates, right?"
"12910620","12918400"," Am I just, you know, I'll just have to add."
"12918620","12923880"," If you're in, if you're in chat right now, I don't mind you talking about AMC or CVNA, but if"
"12923880","12927300"," you blow up the chat with it, it's going to start fucking banning people."
"12928440","12929980"," Like ask a serious question. "
"12930100","12931400"," Ask a serious question about CVNA."
"12931520","12931880"," No problem."
"12931880","12932380"," I'll do that. "
"12933580","12935040"," Ask a serious question about AMC."
"12935440","12935760"," I'll do that."
"12935920","12936760"," I'll answer that question. "
"12939420","12943840"," If you ever think though that this will be a pump and dump channel, it's never been that it never"
"12943840","12944220"," will be."
"12945880","12948080"," Unless I guess you're pumping and dumping the S&P 500."
"12948080","12953340"," I don't know how we could do that, but this is the boring channel. "
"12953840","12955100"," This is where you make money channel."
"12960240","12960660"," Yeah."
"12961540","12965720"," I know they're sitting on it right now. "
"12965760","12966400"," It's a good question."
"12968800","12970480"," They're sitting on 3852."
"12970860","12972520"," They're sitting right on it right now. "
"12976780","12978660"," But they have eaten through those buyers."
"12978960","12979660"," You see that 530."
"12980020","12985800"," Remember the 530 standing order for five. "
"12986020","12988380"," It was like 535 standing by order."
"12988780","12989320"," That's gone."
"12989460","12992960"," There's like 200 left just grinding through buyers right now. "
"12998980","12999860"," Can we use that channel?"
"13003160","13003620"," Oh, yeah."
"13003780","13004280"," So back to out."
"13004440","13005180"," So they're grinding through. "
"13005320","13006240"," So just so you know, right?"
"13006400","13007020"," They're grinding through."
"13007300","13010040"," I don't know if you know that, but they're trying to grind through this level."
"13011200","13014840"," If they grind through this, the buy orders here, you know what next stop is, right?"
"13015020","13015240"," It's down. "
"13016580","13019820"," I looked at, I looked at AMC for you, or I looked at AMC."
"13020020","13020760"," Look at how I'm saying AMC."
"13021400","13026680"," So on Apple, if you're asking about Apple, there's a high correlation between Apple and NASDAQ and"
"13026680","13027420"," S&P 500. "
"13028300","13030800"," So you want to know what I think about Apple?"
"13031920","13033600"," I think it's not done selling."
"13038300","13040080"," I don't think that it's done selling."
"13043840","13046540"," In any way, shape or form, I don't think 133 is bottom. "
"13051360","13053080"," I think I don't think it's bottom."
"13053500","13054400"," I'll be honest with you."
"13054700","13055760"," The rest of it, I can prove it. "
"13055960","13057040"," It's not that hard to prove."
"13057160","13060900"," You just look at a market breadth and it's not bottom."
"13063200","13064900"," See what I don't know what this was from. "
"13065280","13067900"," I haven't looked at Apple in"
"13067900","13086380"," a"
"13086380","13086380"," while."
"13087900","13090520"," You really have broken all kinds of support here."
"13092080","13093480"," You want to know what I think about Apple?"
"13093700","13095600"," I think it looks very sickly right now. "
"13095680","13103080"," I'll be honest with you."
"13103740","13104700"," I'll clear everything."
"13108440","13109580"," Let's clear all these drawings. "
"13117040","13118200"," Close view up for you."
"13118860","13120980"," Yeah, Apple is not looking too healthy, is it?"
"13121360","13122580"," Let's look at Apple right now."
"13122800","13124080"," You want to know what this looks like to me?"
"13124240","13124400"," Distribution. "
"13126080","13127060"," That's what this looks like."
"13127200","13128720"," This looks like classic distribution."
"13131420","13132980"," It's ready for a fucking bloodbath. "
"13133380","13134060"," I'll be honest with you."
"13134060","13134540"," That's what it is."
"13140040","13143540"," That's really what it's looking like. "
"13149580","13152100"," Let's see if this thrust up right here, right?"
"13152320","13153480"," This thrust up right here."
"13154920","13161220"," You have this thrust up right here and you're coming right back into it right now, right?"
"13167500","13174040"," You're this is not looking at all like consolidation for the leg higher, right?"
"13174960","13176480"," This is called distribution in here."
"13177560","13178960"," You have the move down. "
"13181520","13185720"," We know that there was buyers here before, but do you see this rejection here?"
"13186360","13196460"," So this rejection up here tells you if you had buyers here, you have sellers here told no, right?"
"13196660","13197280"," This is distribution."
"13198180","13203380"," We're going to come back down here and check this right here, but furthermore, it wasn't likely"
"13203380","13204100"," going to go lower."
"13205560","13215360"," So if you'd found this to be consolidation, we would have made another attempt"
"13215360","13221300"," higher, right, and broken through or had the double top, right?"
"13221480","13222540"," Double top, double top. "
"13222780","13223560"," We're not getting that."
"13224400","13228940"," So I'm going to tell you that you are looking for, you might get a bounce here."
"13231120","13237700"," You might get a bounce here, but for all intents and purposes, here's your sellers. "
"13240040","13241140"," They mean business."
"13241720","13244320"," The market is showing they mean business."
"13245120","13252160"," We were already here, so you're going to be looking for this area down here for buyers. "
"13252420","13257180"," You're going to be looking for your next level of buyers somewhere down in here."
"13259420","13263320"," So as we check next, get down there."
"13265580","13267520"," You get a reaction here with this thing. "
"13267560","13268260"," This ain't shit."
"13269520","13277100"," And if anything, you make that yellow as a question mark."
"13278240","13284920"," And your next level is, sold it up, came back down, pushed it up. "
"13285040","13286120"," This is a big one though right here."
"13287780","13290120"," As you can see, you can see all this down here."
"13290260","13292020"," This is actually pretty good area down here. "
"13292260","13294440"," Anything below here, it's like 105."
"13295420","13297260"," This is all nice, constructive."
"13297820","13298700"," Boom, up. "
"13298880","13300900"," One, two, three, four."
"13302680","13312460"," So this is your, this is all some serious"
"13312460","13313340"," levels down below."
"13313520","13315760"," I would hope these hold here. "
"13316540","13324560"," I'm going to assume that this is somewhere around 10,000 on, so this right here is probably 10,000"
"13324560","13325260"," on NDX."
"13326160","13328140"," And you break this shit right here, right?"
"13328280","13333040"," We're going in the depths of hell."
"13333100","13343020"," And I assume this is all,"
"13343560","13345320"," you guys can't see this stuff, can you?"
"13345600","13347240"," You got the fucking book map on. "
"13350540","13360400"," This is all, I'm going to assume this all corresponds with 10,000 on, uh, this"
"13360400","13361460"," isn't healthy, right?"
"13361880","13365920"," You got, this is pretty easy to figure out for yourself."
"13366120","13369000"," So when you guys look at distribution and stuff like that, right?"
"13369500","13371520"," They came down and tested this level, right?"
"13372520","13375040"," A little bit of buyer stepped in, but this is a big thrust, right?"
"13375260","13377880"," Big buyers come in and tell you, fuck no, right?"
"13378040","13382980"," So you come back up here and you're checking again, see if they're still, they're still selling"
"13382980","13385320"," into strength, which they are right at a larger time frame."
"13385980","13386940"," So they sold it down. "
"13387980","13391900"," First check you had more buyers step in and said, yep, right?"
"13392620","13394400"," Now you have all these trap buyers up in here."
"13394720","13400760"," This is supposed to look like distribution, or not just distribution or accumulation, right?"
"13401220","13404160"," You would have expected a thrust up, but you didn't get that thrust up."
"13405360","13411280"," So because you didn't get this, this is all, this is all no go, right?"
"13411560","13414140"," What happens is they're not just going to go to this level. "
"13414140","13416860"," Seeing that Putin thing, and I'm going to go to that level anymore."
"13416860","13420640"," They're going to make energy pricing, the target, the blow, peak software is going to happen."
"13420840","13426380"," I'm going to assume this lines up with some lower lows. "
"13427100","13432540"," That's my target for right now one, one 22 10 on another 10 bucks, believe it or not, that probably"
"13432540","13433860"," puts us at the weekly moving average."
"13434700","13442070"," It's pretty fucking low, right?"
"13442430","13444070"," Even after all this sound pretty low."
"13444890","13451030"," So if you get this trade higher on Apple, you can already see where they teed off here, here, here,"
"13451270","13452450"," here, and here. "
"13453770","13501540"," We can do, well, I"
"13501540","13501900"," did it."
"13502300","13503020"," Okay."
"13531110","13532570"," Previous high in here. "
"13533530","13535030"," Previous high, previous low."
"13547890","13549750"," So this would be your point of control."
"13688380","13690660"," You are up on Vwap right now. "
"13692200","13693300"," That is good to see."
"13695720","13701060"," If you can catch a bounce in here on Vwap and take it out to notice it says that Russia"
"13701060","13703640"," and Belarus to continue with military drills."
"13714300","13716020"," I still love trading Apple. "
"13723580","13729510"," Moving on, we're just starting to catch up with Spy right now."
"13729670","13731530"," Let's take a look at the EMA."
"13741730","13744010"," So I want you to see this blue line right here. "
"13744210","13754720"," If you see that blue line right there, if"
"13754720","13758420"," you see something like this, start trading above this blue line right here."
"13759020","13760880"," This could become constructive."
"13769470","13771730"," So wait and see right here if it gets constructive. "
"13774270","13775990"," We'll look at Apple on that chart as well."
"13777470","13784890"," So on Apple, you want to see the retest back down to the EMA, EMA, and stay above it to"
"13784890","13786470"," 133, Rachel Day at least."
"13822390","13827010"," I think this is where we got the, these are where we got the pump yesterday too. "
"13827770","13828550"," Let's see it right here."
"13830550","13831330"," And yesterday, Friday."
"13835070","13837770"," Trade above the EMA back down underneath. "
"13838050","13839650"," We actually got that, that rip higher."
"13840050","13840510"," See it right here."
"13842990","13845730"," One, two, and then boom, three. "
"13848630","13850630"," Haven't quite seen that strength yet."
"13856400","13861080"," One, two, come back down and then you get your three pushed up here."
"13862240","13862680"," See if it happens. "
"13867620","13869140"," Well, I'm not sold on it yet."
"13869140","13879540"," I'll be honest with you."
"13879540","13891890"," Oh, no worries,"
"13891890","13892230"," bro. "
"13892490","13893290"," I'll check it."
"13893430","13894870"," I'll check whatever you guys want when I have time."
"13894870","13908200"," I mean, it's constructive here, but Apple's"
"13908200","13911900"," constructive here, but this is Apple right here. "
"13912800","13921040"," This is constructive, but you know, they start fucking selling off this."
"13921300","13923080"," They like, they're teeing off, right?"
"13923960","13929340"," You can see them teeing off in here, right?"
"13929680","13930920"," Just teed off down here."
"13931320","13932820"," Boom, sold it right back down, right?"
"13934200","13938760"," Um, you want constructive, it has to be, you know, one, two, three, move up higher. "
"13939600","13942580"," And even then you're talking about grind to like one thirty three."
"13944440","13945780"," Uh, it's, it's hard."
"13949100","13951900"," Like even timing this down here, this bottom is really rough. "
"13952160","13957260"," This is not, um, that doesn't mean this isn't a good trade in here."
"13957380","13958680"," It's how long does the trade last?"
"13962310","13964550"," We already know there's sellers back here too."
"13966550","13968130"," They sold this down right here. "
"13968190","13969250"," They sold it down again."
"13970010","13971130"," Sold it down again."
"13971590","13980460"," We, with cumulatively, when you look at it, just look at this cumulatively, right?"
"13985780","13988440"," They tried, they tried, they tried selling it there. "
"13988580","13989400"," They couldn't get it done."
"13990280","13991600"," Came back and they sold it there."
"13991980","13992800"," Came back in here. "
"13992840","13993500"," They sold it there."
"13993940","13994880"," So what are they looking for?"
"13995140","13998140"," They're just looking for one more moment to be like, fuck you, we're coming into here again."
"13999240","14000160"," And there it is. "
"14004560","14010620"," So what's, what's, or what's, where do you take the bull trade here?"
"14011720","14014520"," Well, I guess that point is where you take the bull trade here where you feel confident."
"14015640","14018800"," That doesn't mean if we don't squeeze up higher, you can't make that money."
"14019000","14019360"," You can't. "
"14019460","14019720"," Absolutely."
"14020060","14020620"," Can you make that money?"
"14020860","14020860"," Yes."
"14022320","14025460"," Uh, but at the least you know they're here waiting, right?"
"14026100","14029720"," They've been here waiting for one, two, and three days. "
"14033060","14034500"," Oh, they're just, they're just sitting here."
"14035220","14037080"," Just sitting here waiting for you."
"14038120","14047500"," You know, so, so they can just, you know, pound it down on you and smash it lower. "
"14048400","14049460"," This is like a bull trap."
"14049980","14053880"," Now, nothing's going to happen, but they're here."
"14054140","14054620"," One, two, three. "
"14054800","14060540"," They're sitting here just waiting for that fucking, you know, trap your ass in there, slam it down,"
"14060840","14070640"," and then spy gets down to, spy comes down here and closes the gap, right?"
"14070840","14072380"," Here's the, the gap closed down here."
"14073040","14077020"," I mean, while you're, you know, bag holder Bobby, no offense bag holder Bobby."
"14078120","14080180"," I think he's a bear too, but it could be wrong. "
"14081040","14086260"," You know, your bag holder Bobby, and there's just one last little stretch here and it slams down"
"14086260","14089040"," and then you're, you kind of fucked and you missed that whole turn higher."
"14090740","14094740"," Now we could go higher here, but this is spy now, right?"
"14095140","14097100"," Notice how it looks a lot like the same, right?"
"14097220","14099000"," You got one, right?"
"14099320","14104980"," Two, and they tried it again on the open today, so you got a lot of pressure here."
"14106140","14110040"," You know, this, if we just put this chart upside down, you'd say we're going up, right?"
"14111380","14116960"," Because you got all those pressures downward pressure, trying to force this down to close that gap. "
"14117520","14122780"," And to be honest with you, as a bull, like if you want to show a thing trade here, we're"
"14122780","14123880"," coming into the close on Friday."
"14124560","14126900"," I was like, hell yeah, let's buy this rip here."
"14127440","14129400"," And Chase said, look above you. "
"14129800","14132640"," And he's like, this is the place from the tee off down."
"14133040","14135900"," So we were like, let's put some cheap puts here, right?"
"14136120","14137440"," 20 cent, 30 cent puts here."
"14138540","14140280"," And they're actually paying today. "
"14140600","14142240"," What have paid for the call side of this trade?"
"14142960","14144960"," So the trade's a flat trade at this point."
"14145240","14152060"," But, you know, if you have like that, that one moment where you're looking for the retracement for"
"14152060","14160160"," where we are right now, you have to either wait until you're above these sellers here, take this"
"14160160","14165540"," trade with confidence for the retracement, or you're waiting for the bloodbath down here."
"14167140","14168780"," It doesn't mean you can't trade in here. "
"14171440","14173140"," It just is like the danger zone."
"14177910","14181010"," So I'm not saying, let's say, and this isn't good."
"14181550","14183730"," And says that Russia doesn't want to be too old. "
"14183750","14188770"," I'm saying, like you want to be up."
"14191270","14192670"," So just look right here."
"14193910","14196830"," Remember, remember when Friday we did this whole thing here?"
"14198570","14199570"," You can see it, right?"
"14201370","14202370"," Start squeezing above. "
"14203250","14207010"," As soon as it starts, you want to have your finger in the buy button for a squeeze, you can."
"14207790","14213210"," So if we start squeezing above here and you like slam the buy button, you want to see the bounce,"
"14213430","14213630"," right?"
"14214270","14216930"," And you're like, long, long, long, and you see the roll here."
"14219110","14220650"," We haven't seen that yet here, right?"
"14221730","14223050"," Kind of starting to see it. "
"14223350","14229210"," Kind of starting to see it, but kind of starting to see it."
"14231450","14232430"," Not quite there."
"14234870","14241550"," And maybe you could, you could like have your finger on the buy button and watch the squeezing"
"14241550","14241990"," start. "
"14242870","14244030"," The explosive moves start."
"14245230","14247770"," You know, the catch at all, you just catch two or three pumps off it or whatever."
"14249410","14256890"," But uh, there are more buyers stepping in. "
"14257030","14263370"," You can see some accumulation happening right now on the dome, DOM, the DOM."
"14265830","14267350"," It's tough to say here."
"14268670","14270090"," We're already below it over here. "
"14271650","14272470"," On Apple."
"14275700","14277240"," Tesla pumping and ripping now."
"14277780","14279500"," Beautiful, beautiful movement on Tesla. "
"14284470","14285710"," Beautiful squeeze on Tesla."
"14301900","14303060"," I'll send up a train with you."
"14303280","14304040"," I'm interested in it. "
"14305120","14305360"," Money."
"14305560","14306660"," I'm not anti-taking this trade."
"14324720","14327380"," If we start blasting off, time's the right now. "
"14328240","14328840"," One o'clock."
"14362630","14363210"," Fucking middle trade."
"14399440","14403980"," Just saying I'm trying to, trying to ban some, some keywords and I don't know how exactly to do"
"14403980","14404480"," that at the moment. "
"14405580","14407480"," You have to do it in the back of the back end."
"14416420","14418060"," Tesla just pumping and cranking."
"14425710","14428630"," So I was looking at this on Friday when they sold this off in the bell. "
"14468120","14470200"," It's a fucking bull trap, man."
"14479530","14484190"," Just seeing more dialogue between from Putin and Belarus is Lukashenko here as well."
"14484710","14489070"," The businesses that our enemies want to stop Russia's integration with Belarus, while Belarusian"
"14489070","14492830"," leader Lukashenko says that we can't protect Belarus's independence alone. "
"14503940","14507040"," Let me see what you guys are texting here."
"14515440","14516540"," Give me just a quick second."
"14558820","14559600"," All right. "
"14569140","14569820"," Quick yellow."
"14570360","14571140"," I have to do that."
"14571240","14572980"," The words I have to do outside of streams. "
"14572980","14574560"," So I'll add those words today."
"14626460","14629180"," It looks like it's going to, it looks like it's going to squeeze right now."
"14629380","14630520"," I just don't want anything to do with it. "
"14636490","14638250"," I get it."
"14638510","14640290"," I just don't want to, I don't want to talk."
"14640450","14643750"," I'm not here to trade that shit. "
"14644410","14645990"," I'm not, no offense either."
"14646250","14654120"," There's no way that you would ever find me."
"14654980","14656800"," I'm not here to like burn your accounts. "
"14657580","14660260"," I'll never be here to burn your accounts."
"14661460","14668200"," I'm not going to, I have zero interest in like people make channels about this shit."
"14668840","14671800"," And what happens is you lose all your money and then I play KU. "
"14672260","14674680"," I pull up the titty and you suckle on it."
"14676060","14679020"," And you come back every day because you're upside down."
"14680680","14684660"," And it's like this really like repetitive doom shit. "
"14684880","14686000"," I don't want anything to do with it."
"14691100","14693340"," Yeah, it's like a, it's like a pretty trap right here."
"14694280","14698160"," I've seen too many people lose money with that shit. "
"14698400","14699600"," I don't want anything to do with it."
"14700940","14704660"," I don't want anything to do with the industry that's built around it, streaming around it."
"14706840","14708100"," Fucking tweeting about it. "

"14756800","14759500"," Believe it or not. "
"14773910","14776860"," That's right."
"14777060","14777960"," The fin to it peeps."
"14778700","14785500"," Yeah, we don't try to sit around here, but not only that, but you tell me a free fucking service"
"14785500","14787080"," that offers all this shit for free. "

"14798560","14798900"," I don't know."
"14800480","14802480"," I do videos of me washing my armpits."
"14808300","14809400"," Yeah, yeah, they do. "
"14810240","14811540"," They re-stream too."
"14812180","14814120"," There's a service that re-streams my streams."
"14814120","14815300"," I know they do. "
"14816600","14820160"," They're like out of indie or something when they re-stream my stuff."
"14822380","14823040"," That's okay."
"14824400","14826440"," There's bots that follow me. "
"14827520","14829260"," I can show them to you."

"14845600","14846680"," Time to play videos."
"14852300","14854160"," Trish with fans like Helium. "
"14854680","14856020"," We don't do that."
"14856980","14865080"," There's a time when if it gets too expensive, it might offer some kind of a service that's like for"
"14865080","14867820"," indicators or something, but not right now."
"14867920","14873980"," Nothing's cost me anything that's too crazy right now, so if it gets out of control or something,"
"14874040","14875860"," it makes me fed reverse repar-operation. "
"14876300","14883480"," I'm just not down with the, I'm here to help you guys make money."

"14909500","14910520"," This is how I make this. "
"14910760","14911000"," I live."
"14911800","14913780"," I think I live by trading the stock market."
"14914200","14914960"," Like everybody else. "
"14919020","14919720"," Oh, gross."

"14960200","14960780"," do have a website. "
"14961420","14962600"," It's captainjimjames.com."
"14964160","14968340"," If you go there and just sign up for it, I'm going to send you an invite like this week."
"14968760","14974600"," And we're going to do a video on how to buy oversold conditions."
"14975280","14977420"," If any of you out there, I'm going to tell you something. "
"14978080","14981900"," Any of you out there, do not have a trade."
"14984200","14986080"," That's 100% of the time."
"14988040","14994760"," If any of you guys complicate your trades, this is really a message to people out there that are"
"14994760","15001020"," fucking running the wheel or flies or managing trades or any of that shit. "
"15002220","15004420"," Tony, this is like the dumbest trade in the world."
"15005480","15006820"," It's as stupid as it can be."
"15007500","15008760"," It's as easy as it can be. "
"15009600","15012700"," Mentally, it's difficult, but it always works."
"15013620","15018480"," If I can show it, I'll show it to you and we'll do a private live stream or a zoom"
"15018480","15019340"," call or something."
"15019340","15020580"," So this week, we're doing it. "
"15021840","15026240"," And I'm going to send you an email and I'm just going to tell you, because we're getting close to"
"15026240","15026380"," it."
"15027480","15028720"," We're getting close."
"15028880","15036990"," And the close part about this is, the close part about this is we're coming into it. "
"15038410","15048150"," So right now, right now, right now is like the one to three weeks where"
"15048150","15052330"," you're going to get the class."
"15053190","15055990"," And then you're going to get when I say to you, this is what you're looking for."
"15057190","15058830"," And just have patience down here. "
"15058930","15059790"," It's like all about patience."
"15060590","15065490"," And these trades, I go all in, not all in, but I go pretty fucking heavy on them."
"15066530","15069930"," And these, this is what you make this trade, right?"
"15070790","15079170"," And this fucking trade pays for you to piss away your money on zero dates on Tesla fucking calls"
"15079170","15082050"," and only other nonsense you want to chase. "
"15083310","15085950"," Pays your bills, pays your girlfriend, pays your boyfriend."
"15087610","15089250"," Works every single fucking time."
"15089430","15089710"," This shit works. "
"15090230","15090750"," Not every single time."
"15090750","15095590"," The Nastrix works like 29 out of 30 times."
"15096630","15097590"," The clockwork. "
"15102890","15106450"," And all I hear is bullshit from people who are like, yeah, but it's, you know, this and that."
"15106630","15108650"," You could make this trade and walk away from the stock market."
"15110490","15118330"," If you don't get sucked into the soap opera and sucked into the social media and sucked into all"
"15118330","15120870"," the crack that they put on the table for you to smoke out there. "
"15123110","15125790"," And I'll show you how to time it and how to look for it."
"15126530","15128510"," And the indicators that you should be looking for on it."
"15129450","15130770"," And you add one, two, three up. "
"15132550","15134950"," And I know every time I show this shit, right?"
"15135710","15136670"," People come to the stream."
"15136950","15140070"," They're like, why don't you just buy zero dates or weeklies or monthlies?"
"15141150","15143190"," It just doesn't work every single time, not like that."
"15143410","15143910"," They'll burn. "
"15144930","15147330"," You know, like your win rate goes down."
"15147530","15149710"," So you need to have a bread and butter trade."
"15150890","15152430"," Make it as simple as possible. "
"15154110","15155210"," Prints every single time."
"15155670","15156950"," This is the idea."
"15161700","15164700"," You just sign up to my website, capjurjames.com."
"15164820","15166380"," It says join the Navy or something. "
"15167180","15167560"," Join the crew."
"15168980","15169920"," I don't know."
"15170180","15171980"," You guys will never get emails from me for nonsense. "
"15172960","15176260"," Like you won't ever get like the Brazilian emails from me."
"15176400","15179460"," If I send you some, it's something for you to read or consider."
"15180560","15188220"," Or it's an invitation to something that's free and there's no scams, no not shit. "
"15188560","15189600"," Never has been, never will be."
"15189900","15190880"," Not a single instance of it."
"15195220","15197000"," I've had people try to bait me. "
"15197800","15201900"," Like bait B-A-I-T on DMs. I've had women try to bait me."
"15202860","15204300"," I've had all kinds of stupid shit. "
"15205580","15207880"," I've never, I've never exposed any of these people."
"15208160","15208560"," None of you."
"15209680","15212780"," But I've had people like, you know, you get all kinds of different scams. "
"15213060","15215000"," I've never once like succumbed to it."
"15216080","15217140"," None of that bullshit."
"15217420","15219460"," I got a wife, my wife is smoking hot. "
"15220160","15221620"," She's like smoking."
"15222260","15223220"," Blonde blue-eyed."
"15224320","15225180"," Great butt. "
"15230060","15231640"," You'll never see me driving a Lambo."
"15232300","15233280"," Any of that nonsense."
"15239480","15240900"," Oh, you want to send some calls?"
"15241260","15242120"," Oh, James is in the house. "
"15243460","15244560"," James is feeling it."
"15244780","15245240"," Here we go."
"15245380","15247980"," We always want to know if we're going to start ripping, start ripping. "
"15249340","15252020"," Yeah, just stop for the free scam."
"15252940","15253860"," Shut up every day and watch."
"15257610","15258810"," Just shut up every day. "
"15260850","15263150"," Oh, we're getting, we're getting it to you."
"15263230","15263610"," Hold on here."
"15269000","15270040"," I don't know, man. "
"15270660","15272620"," I'm looking at puts right now, the put side."
"15275600","15276560"," They're cheap again."
"15276780","15277860"," Like puts are getting cheap again. "
"15281260","15282560"," I love master baiting."
"15287780","15290340"," You're feeling the calls, James?"
"15291120","15292080"," I feel the calls too."
"15292320","15293260"," I get what you're saying, man. "
"15293720","15294140"," I'm watching."
"15294380","15294800"," We're all watching."
"15294940","15297100"," We're all here to buy the rip higher. "
"15322470","15327000"," All right."
"15327040","15328160"," I'm in some calls with the James."
"15331140","15332520"," I got some calls with you, bro. "
"15341350","15342750"," I'm in some calls with you, handsome."
"15349850","15350950"," Yeah, I'm wrong, Spy."
"15356690","15358450"," I'm in some calls right now. "
"15358670","15359530"," I'll have to get back to that."
"15362860","15365220"," I'm watching some Spy zero dates."
"15382310","15384450"," I'm in the sets and price targets above. "
"15384690","15385130"," We can get there."
"15394250","15396290"," Try to get some VWAP action up here."
"15396650","15397010"," Pivot above. "
"15398970","15400010"," It's a couple of little small places."
"15400370","15403490"," We got some construction constructiveness going on."
"15403690","15405210"," One, two, three. "
"15407710","15409410"," Careful of like a quick roll and then a bounce."
"15426700","15428280"," So we'll see what goes on here."
"15430360","15431820"," You're in 384s. "
"15432440","15435280"," What's your date on those 384s for later today?"
"15445090","15446490"," Middle the afternoon pump."
"15466250","15466810"," Thanks, Gil."
"15466910","15467590"," I appreciate it, brother. "
"15471000","15471740"," Yeah, I see."
"15471860","15475440"," I see 383 69 and 382."
"15476660","15477660"," I see three to two. "
"15477780","15481820"," There's three to two to start and then 386 69 above."
"15490860","15492480"," Let's see if we can get an afternoon pump going."
"15496650","15498570"," Yeah, Tesla's fucking ripping, man. "
"15500610","15501950"," Tesla's blasting right now."
"15502010","15503390"," I can't switch over because I'm in calls."
"15508870","15540670"," I want to see a fucking nice 100% here, 200% or 300% on"
"15540670","15542030"," the keep on pumping, baby. "
"15542210","15542910"," Keep on pumping."
"15543170","15543990"," You know how we do this, right?"
"15544910","15545810"," Keep on ripping."
"15554990","15556770"," Keep on pumping. "
"15556770","15557030"," in."
"15558910","15571850"," First price target 3.2.04. Hold"

"15581890","15582650"," I appreciate it, brother."
"15584390","15585750"," Thanks for supporting the channel."
"15589730","15592770"," I just got stopped out, I think. "
"15592770","15593150"," Hold on."
"15596870","15598530"," Yep, I'm back out again."
"15599670","15601210"," There's a quick liquidity grab here. "
"15601310","15601990"," Let's see what happens."
"15606210","15608530"," Make sure you put stops on when you're trading this shit."
"15621740","15624060"," I just got stopped out just a second ago. "
"15667840","15669200"," I'm still flat right now."
"15672720","15676660"," Sometimes you get that quick one, two, and then rolls for liquidity and boom, we're off and"
"15676660","15676820"," running."
"15707120","15708100"," Hold on a second here. "
"15727820","15729340"," Got a still rotation going on."
"15729440","15730720"," You can see it in the volume today."
"15750070","15757710"," We're talking about earlier today, we're saying 360,000 volume right now. "
"15758430","15758890"," It's insane."
"15759770","15761450"," It's like five times the normal volume."
"15762350","15765310"," Still part of the rotation trade. "
"15767770","15769810"," Yeah, backholder Bobby."
"15815960","15828740"," Josh took us short"
"15828740","15829180"," in futures."
"15837440","15839700"," Yeah, they got like 381 p."
"15839900","15843340"," They've got 243,000 contracts. "
"15845180","15846620"," They're like 70 cents."
"15846980","15849000"," It looks like sideways into the bell with that trade."
"15861010","15865470"," They wind up usually the last week they were grinding it down to like 30, 60 cents or so. "
"15866190","15868350"," That's what they were doing on Tesla on Friday."
"15869710","15871090"," They were pinning Tesla down."
"15872210","15873470"," They're doing it right now in Spy. "
"15877320","15878840"," Just careful here on Tesla."
"15879160","15882580"," You see the brake on this blue line."
"15882720","15883380"," Never a good sign. "
"15884720","15885620"," Probably get."
"15887120","15889400"," Not always, but you don't want to see this right here."
"15892820","15894640"," It's a nice move on Tesla right there. "
"15918160","15921360"," Yeah, so this is a you can."
"15921560","15922880"," I'll show you two things right real quick."
"15923120","15930120"," So you can like you can do is hold on. "
"15930880","15932020"," Okay, so what you can do is this."
"15932200","15932320"," Okay."
"15933860","15935840"," I'll put two different indicators up for you. "
"15935900","15936980"," This is the Jenna Marcus."
"15937480","15938140"," What I'm looking at right now."
"15938140","15940900"," This is the Jenny Marcus five minute. "
"15943870","15945350"," Keep you can use."
"15945610","15947150"," There's a couple of different indicators for you."
"15947330","15948830"," So the Jenny Marcus 20 minute. "
"15949830","15952290"," He did it a really neat paper on him, right?"
"15952890","15959310"," So if you start trading below that the Jenny Marcus 20 day estimated moving average in the five"
"15959310","15959810"," minute chart."
"15959810","15963210"," And you can see it in teen off it, right?"
"15963550","15964070"," Teed off it."
"15964330","15965030"," Teed off it. "
"15965490","15966070"," Teed off."
"15966070","15967770"," They're looking to tee off it again right now."
"15970510","15970950"," Right. "
"15970950","15972290"," To get to lower lows."
"15973310","15975350"," You can also see when we're above it."
"15976390","15977230"," Here's an example. "
"15977390","15978150"," It's being above it, right?"
"15981420","15981700"," Came down."
"15981860","15984260"," You had one, two, and we just blast it off."
"15985100","15985540"," Right. "
"15986280","15987620"," Here's the confirmation in the trade."
"15987620","15988020"," Right."
"15990440","15991200"," Makes sense. "
"15991540","15994100"," So that's an estimated moving average on a five minute chart."
"15996590","16000670"," I'll try to cycle through on 15 minute charts, not with the EMA."
"16000950","16001350"," I'll try to. "
"16001430","16003110"," I'll try to cycle through with."
"16003590","16006510"," A moving average."
"16007410","16009370"," And I'll on a 15 minute chart. "
"16010670","16011950"," You can actually see."
"16014070","16015030"," When we're above."
"16016410","16016850"," Right. "
"16017230","16019770"," When we break above here, you can see the move higher, right?"
"16020610","16021790"," On a 15 minute chart."
"16022590","16026750"," And this one is the 100, the 200, the 120, and the 100."
"16029730","16033410"," And so you're looking for that, for that, for that break above, right?"
"16033590","16034470"," You can see it right here. "
"16034910","16036090"," How they tighten up right here."
"16037010","16038590"," You get that blast above."
"16041770","16043850"," So we're below in the 15 minute, right?"
"16044050","16045430"," This is negative Nancy, right?"
"16045630","16048490"," This is selling off this, right?"
"16049130","16049950"," Selling off this, right?"
"16052290","16054430"," But I just also works well on a one minute. "
"16054570","16057010"," So that's why I tend to use this on the one and the 15."
"16058370","16060870"," Because I can see where they're teeing off here as well, right?"
"16061130","16064830"," So they're on a one minute, they're teeing off these moving averages."
"16066270","16066750"," Right?"
"16068550","16074790"," And even on a one minute, if you want to see where it gets, where it gets bullish, you can"
"16074790","16076850"," see, right?"
"16078050","16082030"," Come above the moving averages, retest, move higher. "
"16082370","16082610"," See that?"
"16087750","16089790"," So that's depending on what you're looking at."
"16090650","16093210"," Hopefully you guys stopped out with me above here."
"16094450","16097090"," Did you guys stop out with me above when I said I stopped out here?"
"16097330","16098510"," I said I'm going to put some stops on. "
"16102790","16104010"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"16104190","16104550"," What's bullish?"
"16104810","16105310"," What's bearish?"
"16106810","16110590"," And where you're looking to get bullish on different time frames?"
"16111930","16115950"," You should pause the video and you can switch back and forth from these."
"16116170","16117350"," So on a one minute chart, right?"
"16119370","16122510"," Y'all, sometimes I'll get rid of the, I'll get rid of the moving averages."
"16124570","16128410"," I'll throw up the EMA, put it on the five minute. "
"16130470","16133270"," Right, start coming down here and seeing if we're back above again."
"16134290","16136990"," We're not trading below it, right?"
"16142780","16145520"," Get rid of the EMA moving averages back up."
"16150390","16153070"," We've broken below this previous low here. "
"16153590","16154550"," See this, right?"
"16156010","16158770"," Broken below this previous low, so what's below here?"
"16158930","16159510"," We know where it is."
"16159630","16160130"," We know it's below."
"16161250","16165110"," And that is the gap closed down at 375. "
"16166930","16169450"," Talk to you about when you see stuff like this, right?"
"16170190","16172610"," Break down below, right?"
"16172850","16176390"," This is when a bear takes over and they want to start moving."
"16176390","16181570"," And when it says negative gamma here, this is like bad negative gamma."
"16182070","16185510"," It's like when things start moving really fast and lower. "
"16187490","16189790"," So you can see the push down, the push down."
"16190570","16194970"," If we were to flip this chart or upside down, you would look at this and say, oh, it's very"
"16194970","16195390"," bullish."
"16196470","16200150"," I'm so just starting to push this down below and try to force selling into the bell. "
"16200890","16207830"," I guess I guess bulls would say that's a double bottom."
"16208190","16209630"," Like fuck you, cap."
"16209990","16211290"," Pools are always bulls, right?"
"16211650","16212810"," So bottom cap are going up. "
"16216130","16218490"," But there's no confirmation of that yet, is there?"
"16218850","16221270"," None of your averages are saying that."
"16222510","16225730"," So you let this you let this work for you, then take trade."
"16237240","16239060"," I made 20% on them. "
"16239460","16242720"," I went from like 47 cents to like 50."
"16243260","16245160"," I think I triggered it like 50 or 52 cents."
"16248240","16249640"," I made 20% I'm happy. "
"16253180","16253940"," Let me check."
"16254320","16254460"," Hold on."
"16254540","16254980"," I'll tell you what I made. "
"16269980","16272280"," I made I made nine cents on them."
"16272900","16273680"," That's pretty good."
"16310130","16318290"," You just don't seem to have that. "
"16318450","16319350"," What are you Andreas?"
"16319730","16321770"," What do you what what platform are you on?"
"16327720","16329080"," What are you using for charting?"
"16335700","16337340"," Test with my girlfriend the long signal."
"16343870","16345790"," Yeah, so if you're there."
"16349440","16350460"," He's a guy on. "
"16351560","16356460"," He's a guy on Fintuit that uses a 20 EMA."
"16356720","16357960"," It's just a simple it's not an indicator."
"16358580","16360180"," It's just a moving average. "
"16360600","16361700"," Look look up."
"16362840","16364840"," Do you are you paying for data on training viewer?"
"16365080","16372200"," No, you can just do a."
"16373820","16375660"," I'll do it on training before you."
"16377180","16379260"," I'm gonna do it on training before you. "
"16385400","16387660"," What do you trade right now SPX or spy?"
"16388439","16389080"," Yes."
"16392490","16394310"," Okay, so time out here Andreas."
"16395790","16399470"," You can't use trading view without paying for data. "
"16400650","16401950"," And even their data."
"16403009","16407009"," Sucks it but only uses data from one exchange, I think."
"16407830","16409310"," So how about this?"
"16411009","16412430"," Go sign up for Webull. "
"16415230","16423840"," And I wonder if I can do like a start teaching how to start charting and Webull maybe."
"16426580","16428180"," So Andreas, I got to tell you something."
"16428400","16430680"," Okay, we're I'm gonna stop what I'm doing here for you guys. "
"16431300","16433200"," Okay, so Andreas listen to me closely."
"16433439","16433640"," Okay."
"16435700","16443700"," If you're trading view their data packages are still not that good and they're expensive. "
"16446700","16453020"," So I don't care where you trade, but if you're gonna have like a free chart that's fast."
"16454560","16455980"," And pays for all the data."
"16457480","16460380"," This is as close as Webull is free. "
"16461259","16462700"," It's as good as book map data."
"16462700","16463460"," It's as good as."
"16464919","16470020"," I don't know you name a name of any service out there that you pay for a lot of money"
"16470020","16470460"," for data. "
"16472860","16477680"," It's as good or better than anything out there."
"16477779","16478540"," It's very fast."
"16479520","16481140"," So just go like you're gonna sign up. "
"16481240","16484540"," I think I think you just go to Webull and click the trade button and I'll bring you to the"
"16484540","16484779"," charts."
"16485400","16489259"," Watch a YouTube video on how to set it up for the black background or something."
"16490740","16492480"," I'm not affiliated with them in any way. "
"16494340","16496300"," I use different charts for different things."
"16496460","16498119"," Trading view use for research stuff."
"16499220","16505860"," And then I trade on I get fucking like three different accounts with different money than I've got. "
"16506460","16510240"," Do other research on Thinkorswim."
"16514360","16518140"," But if you're looking to watch a chart, you have to watch it in real time."
"16518820","16526759"," You can't be watching charts with limited data, limited L.I.M. I.T.E.D., limited data. "
"16526980","16531259"," And you can't be watching charts that are 15 minutes behind or even two minutes or five minutes"
"16531259","16531500"," behind."
"16533380","16534880"," So just get Webull."
"16535880","16538660"," Watch a video on how to set up Webull on a desktop or something. "
"16540340","16547119"," And then even if you're executing a trade somewhere else, you can at least watch a candlestick"
"16547119","16549860"," chart that's almost to the second."
"16551040","16552599"," I don't think I don't know if they offer."
"16552599","16554180"," Only after the minute here. "
"16554580","16563349"," But I pay for data."
"16563349","16566230"," I pay for data on other platforms."
"16567529","16569830"," And I know Webull is as fast as they are. "
"16571070","16573210"," Tucking like a millisecond slower than other."
"16574349","16576130"," They don't have by the second tick."
"16576910","16577770"," Five second ticks. "
"16577990","16578570"," All that kind of shit."
"16578770","16582529"," But for the one minute tick, it's as fast as anything out there for free."
"16586220","16589880"," The reason I say that is because you can then set up an EMA with me. "
"16590259","16591220"," When you do that, right?"
"16592500","16595439"," I wonder if I can do it right now with you."
"16595939","16598480"," I can say I had to set up this chart to look like this if you wanted."
"16600480","16602080"," So you have like a similar experience. "
"16604279","16607860"," How about just go sign up for Webull real quick."
"16612200","16614259"," And get back to me on chat here."
"16616279","16619040"," Maybe I can like I don't know if I'm even signed in here. "
"16619200","16620900"," I'm not I'm not even signed in in this thing."
"16622040","16624860"," This is just Webull not even so I'm not even logged in on this thing."
"16628460","16632200"," It's just it's you could I don't know if you can see it up here, but I'm not logged in. "
"16634180","16636460"," Or you can see that I'm not logged in."
"16640490","16643290"," This is this is like you try a service."
"16643290","16645610"," Then you're like I really like this part of this thing. "
"16646849","16651490"," And the only thing I liked about Webull was their charts were I call them fast charts and they have"
"16651490","16652590"," fast charts for free."
"16653070","16655750"," So I use it here for you guys during the day."
"16662419","16667400"," Yeah, so yeah, so you can set them up to like Webull right here. "
"16669680","16672480"," I'm setting up on one five minutes, 15 minutes."
"16673080","16674500"," I set them up on all of them."
"16676380","16678180"," This is a 15 minute chart. "
"16678419","16679460"," This is a five minute chart."
"16679700","16680619"," This is a one minute chart."
"16684270","16685730"," It's I think it's free. "
"16688869","16690869"," I'm starting to blast through right now."
"16693050","16695990"," And I would never recommend looking at a chart on a phone."
"16696849","16699250"," Ever you should be sitting down with like a laptop. "
"16699990","16703110"," I don't know, maybe an iPad that's connected to a display."
"16704330","16708550"," And if you guys don't have displays out there, I'm going to tell you this like."
"16709990","16716189"," You can if you have you can buy a router like it's like a you plug it in to your. "
"16716669","16719650"," You plug it into whatever you're using like a."
"16720290","16725750"," You have a laptop let's say or a desktop or if you have a tablet that has a mini USB"
"16725750","16727169"," USB C on it or something."
"16728990","16734310"," You can buy something to just to have two or three displays at once."
"16735250","16737410"," You should always have like two or three displays up. "
"16738050","16741950"," And if you like I can't afford a display, get your ass down to like a."
"16742650","16748029"," Like a was thrift shop or something grab like some flat screen TVs."
"16749169","16752290"," Grab some USB or some HDMI cables and."
"16754450","16757930"," They sell like splitters for for for a second. "
"16757930","16761730"," It's called like I think it's called HDMI hub with a USB C."
"16762130","16763730"," You connect the USB C."
"16763890","16764710"," I do this when I travel."
"16765189","16768090"," So I have travel display monitors."
"16769869","16772529"," I just like fold them up and put them in the backpack. "
"16772529","16777210"," But I have a I have a USB C."
"16778210","16780310"," Like distribution hub or some kind."
"16781710","16785430"," Splitter maybe call you HDMI splitter with you with a USB C."
"16785650","16787210"," And I plug that into a laptop."
"16788570","16789990"," I have two screeners. "
"16790290","16791830"," Kind of like a thrift store if you're poor."
"16792350","16795450"," By like two shitty flat screen monitors."
"16797650","16800150"," And the keyboard or something in the mouse. "
"16800830","16806850"," You should be sitting at a desk or in your living room or your bed with a desk next to"
"16806850","16807210"," your bed."
"16821300","16822840"," Yeah, old flat screens are dirt cheap."
"16823000","16826800"," If any of you out there was I should say this is like kind of an important part of a."
"16827180","16833150"," If you're a trader, okay, if you're an investor trader, I don't care what you are. "
"16834290","16835750"," But start I need to do this."
"16835930","16837550"," I need to start these classes like."
"16839010","16840110"," You're a trader and investor. "
"16841270","16845010"," You have to have at least three screens, two screens, three screens."
"16845710","16847310"," You have to minimum."
"16848830","16850590"," And if you're like, I'm too poor for that. "
"16850670","16851410"," I'm going to tell you you're wrong."
"16852230","16854450"," Well, not wrong, but number one."
"16855770","16858090"," If you have a desktop or a laptop, you're good to go. "
"16859250","16861870"," If you if you like, I don't have any of those."
"16863030","16864170"," Then do you have a tablet?"
"16864170","16869770"," If you say I don't have any of those three, I would say to you get on eBay and spend"
"16869770","16876410"," $100 on a shitty desktop that they sell refurbished, like a hundred hundred fifteen bucks, like the"
"16876410","16879550"," IBM little like server, but that's server by heart."
"16879990","16886190"," Now they try to sell as not as NAS servers, but it's not a NAS server, just like cheap windows"
"16886190","16891090"," 10 windows 11 desktop yourself a mouse and a keyboard. "
"16891090","16896790"," If you have a tablet, I'm assuming it has a USB-C on it."
"16897970","16900170"," Get yourself a split of those like 10, 15 bucks."
"16900990","16902930"," Get yourself some $5 HDMI cord. "
"16903150","16904010"," Go down to the strip store."
"16904830","16905490"," Grab some flat screens."
"16906730","16908090"," They're like 10, 15 bucks. "
"16909090","16910450"," And you're set up and ready to rock and roll."
"16911850","16914730"," And you should be always never, never, ever, ever."
"16915210","16916630"," Don't care what anybody tells you. "
"16917390","16919750"," Don't ever trade with your fucking phone."
"16921090","16923410"," I guess you could if you were holding something for like three months."
"16924730","16930430"," Trade with your phone, but you shouldn't, you shouldn't be day trading or trade in weeklies. "
"16931610","16933150"," Or any of that shit by phone."
"16934850","16938490"," If you're making a trade that's like you don't have to manage for a month or two or three months,"
"16938550","16939070"," that's fine."
"16939910","16943150"," If you're just like buying stock to hold it for five years, that's fine. "
"16944010","16953590"," But none of you should be trading without investing 50 bucks, $25, $100 max, like 200"
"16953590","16956770"," in a setup that you can sit down at and trade."
"16957710","16962430"," Take those words and don't fucking trade anymore money if you don't have that setup."
"16972060","16975420"," Telling you, please, please, it'll change your world. "
"16975960","16977100"," That's like step one."
"16977100","16984020"," And then step two, I need to make these videos because, you know, step two will go through how to"
"16984020","16990840"," set up your charts and your, you have your execute trades in one monitor, your execute, you're"
"16990840","16992200"," looking at a chart at another monitor."
"16993080","16995160"," And then you're following the news. "
"16996520","16999540"," Social media, whatever, another monitor."
"17000860","17002420"," And I don't care what you're trading."
"17002420","17012320"," You typically have to have a spy or some form of it, SPXES, NASDAQ, like"
"17012320","17014460"," a watch list or I recently, what list?"
"17015820","17016720"," Some sectors. "
"17017280","17023960"," There's a XLY, like tech, XLF, if the market's going up or going down."
"17027760","17037720"," For like trading during the day, Dixie, HYG, J&K, TLT to an extent, but not really."
"17039080","17043640"," Dixie, VIX, all that stuff and you just cycle through that shit all day long. "
"17045480","17047700"," Trying to find out if this is a bottom, this is not a bottom."
"17055300","17057260"," So, trading views data is great."
"17059860","17061940"," Trading views data is great. "
"17062600","17063260"," It's delayed."
"17064360","17067960"," So, it's a trading view data you can't trade with."
"17068860","17073920"," You can only, in my view, trading view data is only good for research purposes. "
"17074740","17078560"," That's why I tell you guys all the time, like, I don't fucking trade, I would never trade on"
"17078560","17079200"," trading view either."
"17079200","17084420"," It's one of the worst, worst, if they have one negative about trading view, it is that their"
"17084420","17085460"," fucking data sucks."
"17086360","17091980"," Like, you'll get the data eventually, but you're not going to get it even in real time. "
"17092460","17099360"," You're only going to get it from one or two, or to excuse me, it's just one exchange."
"17100220","17106880"," They don't send you all the foreign exchanges, they don't send you all the three major exchanges in"
"17106880","17107120"," the US."
"17107820","17109800"," And if they tell you they do, they're fucking lying. "
"17110200","17110920"," I know they're lying."
"17114440","17115420"," B.D., baby."
"17116540","17117100"," What's up, brother?"
"17120160","17121440"," Christmas whiskey fund. "
"17123140","17126240"," I guess we are going to get shit-faced during the holidays, aren't we?"
"17131030","17132450"," I'm looking for that hammer too, brother."
"17133630","17134750"," Did we get a hammer candle?"
"17139780","17141520"," It's form when you're right, I'm looking at it."
"17145220","17147140"," Oh, no. "
"17150080","17150860"," Not quite."
"17152020","17153940"," It looks like it, but it ain't there yet."
"17154120","17154520"," Good eyes. "
"17155340","17157200"," Whoever sent a hammer candle was forming."
"17159500","17159960"," Exactly."
"17160320","17163300"," Nick asked us saying, I'm telling you the best. "
"17164600","17172740"," Dude, I've paid like 600 to 1,000 bucks for data a month, and I'm telling you the best free"
"17172740","17173420"," data out there."
"17173940","17177240"," I've had charts sitting up side by side, the best free data up there."
"17177640","17178180"," Hands down. "
"17178420","17178660"," We will."
"17179420","17180480"," Gotta give it to him."
"17180800","17182360"," We both sucks for some shit. "
"17182900","17189560"," They're like horrible, like indicators and scripts and all that kind of shit."
"17189680","17190500"," They can't do any of that stuff."
"17191060","17193480"," But like the speed of the bars. "
"17195740","17196900"," You put it up against anything."
"17201820","17202660"," I've tried everything."
"17203140","17204540"," You guys, you don't understand. "
"17204800","17207680"," Like I've paid for every flow service out there."
"17207780","17209620"," I've paid for gamma services."
"17210080","17212420"," I've paid for you. "
"17213000","17215260"," If you've used it, I've had it."
"17215440","17216060"," I've had everything."
"17216920","17218040"," But doing this shit too long. "
"17218240","17221280"," Like somebody comes out of your service and like, I'm going to sign up for that one and try that"
"17221280","17221640"," shit out."
"17222180","17223460"," See if that thing gives me an edge."
"17224060","17224600"," I try them all. "
"17225100","17225860"," All of it."
"17225940","17226480"," I've fed it all."
"17232500","17235400"," Jesus, Gary, you're still holding Estau, brother. "
"17237240","17241280"," There was a huge buy at the bell yesterday and Estau or Friday and Estau."
"17241420","17241860"," I saw that."
"17243940","17245340"," We can take a look at Estau. "
"17247700","17249780"," I don't want to buy Estau until."
"17252160","17253420"," Until we get a retracement."
"17255740","17258660"," What I would say to you, Gary, is if you're going to stay in that town, if you're in that"
"17258660","17261920"," trade, try to close it somewhere down here, bro. "
"17264610","17265910"," Somewhere in this vicinity."
"17269650","17280390"," If you're swinging the Estau, if you're"
"17280390","17282050"," swinging the Estau, right?"
"17284960","17286480"," Like horseshoes and hand grenades."
"17288900","17289840"," You are looking. "
"17290140","17292900"," We are at some point looking for some kind of retracement."
"17293660","17297160"," I don't know what that is, but somewhere in here."
"17300820","17301980"," It doesn't hurt here. "
"17302180","17302880"," It doesn't hurt here."
"17303060","17304180"," It's probably right here."
"17304920","17306200"," We're getting into that area. "
"17311010","17314290"," What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to."
"17315190","17317470"," If you take the Estau trade, right?"
"17318390","17321090"," I don't need to capture this and I don't need to capture that."
"17321170","17322390"," I just need this right here. "
"17322850","17323530"," That makes sense."
"17325630","17328190"," If it slingshots back up, not getting fucked."
"17333130","17338290"," I really want to get back in Estau, like right here. "
"17339390","17341630"," That's where I want to take the next Estau trade."
"17342610","17343170"," Or like right here."
"17343730","17346570"," As a matter of fact, I probably entered again, like, 389. "
"17348890","17349830"," Somewhere in there."
"17349950","17351150"," I want to jump on that."
"17352890","17354830"," I'm thinking about pushing it out to April. "
"17359620","17361460"," Just only because of the theta."
"17361480","17362460"," I don't want to deal with theta burn."
"17366860","17367700"," Oh, no. "
"17368520","17369640"," Mr. Unrealized profits."
"17370680","17371580"," Okay, so I will."
"17373520","17374620"," When are we getting drunk?"
"17379430","17381130"," Bloodbath and down the spry. "
"17381350","17390270"," 379.97. We have now officially broken below the previous low from Friday."
"17392940","17394200"," And now what are we looking for?"
"17396240","17397600"," We're looking for blood."
"17399260","17401100"," What kind of blood are we looking for?"
"17402680","17403360"," Bright. "
"17404160","17404840"," Red."
"17406280","17406660"," Blood."
"17406660","17406800"," Blood. "
"17430280","17431660"," Who's ready for a bloodbath?"
"17434370","17436210"," So somewhere in here, like somewhere."
"17437290","17441550"," I can't tell you when to close your Estau short or your Estau triple leverage calls."
"17444750","17447630"," But if you want to dive in here, you go ahead and dive in here. "
"17450690","17451910"," I understand it."
"17452090","17452430"," I'm a bull."
"17452630","17456770"," So I'll dive in here and shit right to the right to the last dollar. "
"17456770","17457770"," So I get it."
"17465280","17466540"," Yeah, you got to close that gap."
"17467120","17468520"," I would love to buy down here. "
"17468900","17470820"," But down here, I'd feel really good about it."
"17471540","17472300"," I'd feel confident."
"17473920","17475540"," I feel like a..."
"17475540","17477380"," I don't even know what that is like. "
"17479320","17484360"," You guys use all these terms out there now for like chads now, like base or not base."
"17484620","17485440"," I don't know what that shit means."
"17487420","17488780"," AC guys, I'll talk about it. "
"17488900","17490600"," I'm like, I have no fucking clue."
"17490600","17492100"," I have to go read it up on it again."
"17496160","17498280"," Oh yeah, this is the safe side down here. "
"17499100","17500700"," The closer we get, the safer it gets."
"17501900","17503860"," Like, this is all safer down here."
"17505400","17508440"," Once we close that gap, we know there's demand there. "
"17509180","17511100"," I don't know for a fact there's demand down here."
"17513460","17521660"," Or I should say I'm expecting, like a 70% conviction that there's some big ass demand down here is"
"17521660","17521900"," waiting."
"17527830","17528970"," Yeah, if you have money. "
"17530090","17533590"," Now, if you have money, I don't know if I can show them to you."
"17533810","17535130"," I'll take a picture for you."
"17535870","17539090"," If you have money, I've got some, they sell these really kick ass. "
"17541050","17543350"," I've got, I've got three."
"17544590","17545710"," Let me see if I can pull one out."
"17545830","17546970"," I have one not hooked up right now. "
"17549010","17550790"," So yeah, it was right behind me, man."
"17555220","17556760"," So I got these things right here."
"17556760","17558000"," Look at how thin this thing is. "
"17558400","17561540"," Look at how small, it's beautiful."
"17563660","17568100"," And they have these like magnetic cases that encapsulate them."
"17568240","17569580"," You just put them in your backpack. "
"17570780","17573340"," I can pop like three of these in my backpack with a laptop."
"17574260","17575340"," Or I only do two now."
"17575460","17579360"," I didn't realize you couldn't do four monitors on windows, which sucks. "
"17580600","17582000"," And now I actually have two laptops."
"17582400","17585000"," I can hook up five if I want, well, three and three and two."
"17586440","17589400"," I don't know, two and one on two laptops, so five total. "
"17591800","17593340"," The curved ones are super cool."
"17593700","17594580"," I've got one big screen."
"17594880","17595740"," You can see it right here. "
"17596860","17598440"," Kind of see a big screen over there."
"17598700","17600560"," Then I got one, two, three over here."
"17603540","17607740"," And my other laptop, I fucking broke the power supply and I got to bring it down to the guy"
"17607740","17608640"," and fix it for me. "
"17608640","17610320"," It's like a $2,000 up there."
"17610420","17610900"," Fucked it up."
"17617190","17618390"," No, no, you can't. "
"17627470","17630010"," There's nothing you're stuck 16 in their foods now."
"17630350","17632190"," S&P 500 down by around one percent."
"17633890","17634610"," I don't know. "
"17634910","17640650"," My desktop is badass and it only says, Windows only says it does three."
"17644530","17648330"," Bright, red, blood."
"17658530","17660750"," Make a little pool of it over here. "
"17670950","17672390"," Come on down."
"17674090","17676530"," And just bleed it off."
"17678130","17679270"," Come on down. "
"17680350","17682150"," And just bleed it off."
"17682550","17685310"," Three, seventy nine, thirty two right now currently."
"17686970","17688670"," Markets just stare stepping lower. "
"17688750","17690370"," I want you to keep your eyes though right here."
"17690370","17691590"," I want you to look at the book map."
"17692450","17694890"," Might be a little bit of a stoppage here. "
"17697130","17704270"," Be careful of coming into a little bit of support down here somewhere."
"17706570","17707690"," A little bit right here."
"17707730","17709630"," A little stoppage down here. "
"17715860","17719700"," I want to take some off and re-enter again for the next leg down."
"17720920","17721960"," Right in here somewhere."
"17723200","17724580"," Coming into it right now. "
"17727820","17729640"," If you want to place three short."
"17731620","17733440"," You can see it right there, right?"
"17740080","17741820"," Bright red blood."
"17748470","17752490"," It's the one that I use is called LaPau L-E-P-O-W. "
"17753230","17754130"," Expensive though."
"17755110","17756490"," I like them."
"17760310","17761770"," The USB's that came with them. "
"17761890","17763490"," The USB HDMI's kind of sucked."
"17764390","17765410"," I had to go get new ones."
"17766210","17767990"," Expensive ones which kind of pissed me off. "
"17771140","17772000"," But they're high death."
"17772260","17772420"," They're good."
"17772880","17773740"," They're good for traveling. "
"17777360","17779060"," So you go skiing or something."
"17779260","17779900"," You go hiking and biking."
"17780280","17781520"," You go to the hotel or something. "
"17781800","17785800"," And be able to trade or your mother-in-law's house or wherever."
"17785800","17788360"," And you will set up and keep doing your thing."
"17793920","17796100"," It's a L-E-P-O-W. "
"17797380","17799160"," I think you can find them on Amazon."
"17800000","17802080"," I got them on Amazon."
"17802420","17805520"," But there are others on Amazon that I think come up above that one now. "
"17805900","17807380"," I think there's some better ones out there."
"17812680","17822540"," The only problem I've ever had with them is I had to get new mini HDMI to some of"
"17822540","17822720"," them."
"17823940","17825080"," Oh, and this is another thing. "
"17825680","17828500"," Some of these portable monitors don't work with Apple."
"17828800","17829360"," Some of them do."
"17830140","17832760"," You want to make sure that it's compatible before you buy it. "
"17834100","17839240"," And if you go to Amazon and look these things up, some new ones have been coming out that are"
"17839240","17839480"," nicer."
"17839940","17843500"," I brought these I think two years ago."
"17845820","17846620"," No problems. "
"17850890","17852250"," Yeah, here we're getting snow, right?"
"17852630","17853810"," I heard we're getting cold in snow."
"17856920","17857580"," HP Elite."
"17857760","17858660"," Yeah, I heard about those too. "
"17859000","17860060"," That's actually a good price."
"17860420","17860860"," 140 bucks."
"17861120","17863320"," Let me look up with the cost. "
"17865240","17866680"," I don't know what mine cost anymore."
"17867040","17867500"," Let me look about."
"17883720","17885660"," Yeah, the ones that I got are 150 bucks now. "
"17886000","17886360"," That's cheap."
"17887520","17887940"," They've gone down."
"17888100","17889560"," They used to be 250 when I bought them. "
"17891140","17893460"," But they're a couple of years old now, right?"
"17894120","17900040"," They probably have better monitors for the price."
"17900360","17903920"," You know, every year you get, it changes the shit."
"17908490","17910670"," And they have portable monitors down there, $99. "
"17911610","17912690"," It looks like on Amazon at least."
"17917480","17918880"," I just like it because they're portable."
"17928320","17929220"," Yeah, I'll show you. "
"17929220","17930000"," I'm going to show you right now."
"17930200","17931000"," I'll show you guys right now."
"17934420","17935700"," I'm going to show you the. "
"17937960","17940440"," You're saying you want to see the indicators and we go."
"17946010","17947410"," Yeah, long futures here."
"17948970","17950010"," Yeah, as a big spy. "
"17950170","17950530"," This is a big."
"17950590","17951690"," This might be it right here."
"17952490","17954070"," This might be the deepest we go. "
"17954950","17957990"," You can see the way to see the volume bars here."
"17959310","17960130"," One right here."
"17960810","17962430"," Some pretty big volume bars here. "
"17962670","17963150"," One right here."
"17964410","17965550"," One right here."
"17965770","17966310"," These are signatures. "
"17966650","17967890"," These look like signatures too."
"17971200","17972660"," So you might get a squeeze here."
"17985780","17986540"," Hold on here. "
"17987520","17990640"," So do you want to see the indicators that I'm using on Weibo?"
"17991320","17992120"," Is that what you're asking?"
"17992920","17993400"," Niveed."
"17995820","17996540"," Oh, you did need."
"17996760","17997680"," You're a problem, brother. "
"17999080","18002920"," Oh, yeah, okay."
"18003040","18003880"," Let's go through this stuff."
"18006460","18007980"," Okay, so let me see. "
"18008620","18009020"," So."
"18011220","18012700"," On the left hand side."
"18013220","18013480"," Let me mute. "
"18013580","18014620"," Let me mute my thing."
"18020220","18021020"," Okay, so."
"18022580","18023720"," Let me see if I get this right. "
"18024380","18029080"," Stocks, markets, screener, trade, count, paper trading."
"18029280","18030460"," Okay, bottom left hand side."
"18030660","18031360"," You can't see it here. "
"18032420","18034640"," Put in the bottom left hand side of your screen."
"18035700","18037340"," You're going to see a cog wheel."
"18039480","18039920"," Okay. "
"18042220","18043800"," You click on that cog wheel."
"18046360","18047960"," And it's going to bring you up to the screen right here."
"18048900","18050500"," You press theme color. "
"18051440","18052620"," Click that, right?"
"18053760","18055040"," It's the first thing that you do."
"18056820","18061240"," Then you go back up to or you click the close Xbox up here."
"18062600","18064720"," So theme color cog wheels down here. "
"18064720","18065680"," It's hidden on my screen."
"18067500","18069980"," Then you click the dark theme, close this out."
"18071300","18071600"," Right?"
"18071960","18072660"," First thing that you do. "
"18075790","18077910"," Just a heads up against some big volume here."
"18077970","18079170"," This might be it right now, so."
"18082190","18089130"," Then you go to settings and up here in this cog wheel right here. "
"18091070","18093610"," You want to click on all of these here."
"18093770","18100830"," Show extended hours, show high low price, overlap, K line gap, unclick, prod position cost"
"18100830","18106650"," distribution, unclick, show corporate actions, unclick earnings, show dividends and splits."
"18108890","18110310"," Advanced chart fixed. "
"18115090","18117710"," Show open orders, show cost basis line, access."
"18119090","18121790"," Click the first three and click the bottom one, the linear."
"18122950","18123930"," Click done. "
"18126190","18129710"," And then, present on drawings."
"18131710","18135210"," Your delete drawings per page is delete all up here."
"18137150","18138730"," Magnet mode is highlighted. "
"18143220","18145420"," And then, let me see, there's a right click or something."
"18147780","18150300"," Oh, and so gaps."
"18151080","18153800"," If you right click on the screen, you can show gaps. "
"18154160","18155780"," Show the first gap, show the second gap."
"18156780","18158220"," You can show three gaps if you want."
"18158420","18159840"," So there's gaps that will show up in gray. "
"18162550","18167250"," And the only thing that sucks about this program, I think you used to be able to get rid of"
"18167250","18171710"," the grids on this, the little gray grids, but I don't think you can anymore."
"18171990","18173230"," I think there was a time when you could."
"18182430","18183210"," Does it help?"
"18184490","18185230"," You got it?"
"18186890","18191290"," And then what you do is, or what I do is, I cycle through. "
"18191470","18194450"," So I go one minute, five minute, fifteen minute, right?"
"18195810","18200570"," So these are the charts I'm trying to look at one minute, five minute, fifteen minute, right?"
"18201190","18208170"," And then on indicators, I usually use, so I do use VWAP."
"18208930","18211230"," You guys want to see when I use VWAP in a Mac deal."
"18211470","18212110"," I'll show you an RSI. "
"18212250","18213510"," I can show you that right now if you want."
"18214010","18215350"," So I have another screener somewhere."
"18216470","18217090"," Not somewhere. "
"18217330","18218090"," It's over here on the right."
"18219210","18220930"," I should show you guys everything someday."
"18222190","18226350"," So I have another screener open and it'll show me. "
"18228750","18232290"," So the first one is the MA and the VWAP is up, right?"
"18232750","18234290"," The VWAP is just a static thing."
"18234390","18235430"," This is what sucks about Weevil."
"18236150","18237690"," It only offers you a color choice. "
"18238450","18241310"," You can't change the VWAP on Weevil, which sucks."
"18242250","18243210"," I agree with that sucks."
"18244570","18245330"," Moving averages. "
"18247070","18252510"," Just right now, I have highlighted the 100, the 120, and the 200."
"18253710","18258770"," You can change the line style, the size, and this style over here."
"18258970","18262910"," This is like, I don't know what that is, but my inputs. "
"18263230","18266610"," You can change your inputs here and then highlight and click through."
"18266830","18269810"," You know, use this one, then don't use this one."
"18270750","18272090"," Pick your colors that you like. "
"18273850","18278070"," Now, when I don't want to use the moving average, I'll come over to my, I'll click it over here"
"18278070","18279830"," on the left and then I'll come to my indicators."
"18279830","18283570"," And I'll go to the estimated moving average."
"18284050","18288830"," And so boom, I've got this set just to show the 20, right?"
"18289490","18295130"," It shows all these numbers here, but on the style, I only have highlighted the EMA 20. "
"18296250","18300230"," So I know when I'm using this one, then I'm only using it on the five minute chart."
"18300510","18300690"," See?"
"18302590","18304370"," Actually, we're getting a nice green bar down there."
"18304730","18305950"," 1.25 million. "
"18306430","18308990"," So in the five minute right now, we're getting a hammer candle."
"18309570","18313270"," This is called a tweezer, I think, tweezer reversal candle."
"18314470","18315710"," You might want to go long here. "
"18318090","18319590"," I should go long here, but I'm not."
"18320090","18320730"," I wish I hit."
"18329580","18333300"," Okay, so now you have some simple moving averages. "
"18333300","18334460"," You have very fast charts."
"18336240","18337600"," Every, not every once in a while."
"18337800","18340780"," So I've got a screener over here that I'll cycle through, right?"
"18341780","18343660"," And I have it on the spy. "
"18344430","18348960"," And what I will do is let's say I'm using this is the five minute chart."
"18349200","18349340"," Okay."
"18351240","18352060"," Oh, here. "
"18352660","18353540"," We get rid of the EMA."
"18355810","18357690"," I'll just use the MACD."
"18358690","18359230"," Right?"
"18359750","18360310"," Here's MACD. "
"18361710","18364090"," I'll use the moving averages over here, right?"
"18365970","18374500"," And if I'm using, if I'm on a one minute chart, right, on another screener."
"18376080","18377580"," People say that MACD doesn't work."
"18378000","18378860"," They're fucking lying. "
"18379440","18382520"," MACD does work for short, for small timeframe trades."
"18383400","18389240"," Now, the one key on this is that you never, ever, ever, ever wants to rely upon an MACD."
"18389400","18390340"," It's one of the worst indicators. "
"18391440","18393440"," And it can be, though, like a third test."
"18394660","18397560"," It's like if you're checking the sectors, you're already doing this, you're already doing that."
"18397680","18401700"," You're checking the VIX, checking fucking Dixie when it's working, checking. "
"18401700","18405820"," All these other sub sector, I'm like, whoa, what's NDX doing, all that kind of stuff?"
"18407880","18413780"," I will sometimes look on a 15 minute chart and say, well, how deep can it go, right?"
"18414180","18415580"," Because a little bit, we're going to start turning here."
"18418020","18419200"," I'll keep MACD on."
"18419360","18423520"," I'll keep an RSI on a separate screener somewhere. "
"18423900","18424820"," I don't recommend it."
"18424940","18429800"," I'll show it, ever, show it to you guys because it's a horrible fucking horrible indicator."
"18430900","18432160"," Here's RSI, right?"
"18434620","18436640"," But if you start getting down here, right?"
"18436760","18439480"," You're like, ah, this is going to come up and see if this didn't work, did it?"
"18440080","18441520"," There's accumulation here. "
"18441980","18443400"," It really didn't work, right?"
"18443680","18445020"," So RSI, another bad one."
"18445280","18446920"," I can't stand RSI."
"18448260","18449880"," But I'll be honest with you. "
"18449940","18450480"," I keep one."
"18450660","18452600"," I keep one up open on the other side, right?"
"18453480","18458140"," But I never want to recommend it because it's a horrible fucking..."
"18459180","18460060"," Here's Supertrend."
"18460580","18461060"," I don't know. "
"18461140","18461600"," I don't know."
"18461900","18462660"," Hold on a second."
"18465160","18466780"," I don't know if that's the..."
"18466780","18467620"," Wait a minute, did they get that wrong?"
"18468080","18468760"," Yeah, no Supertrend. "
"18470340","18472180"," Yeah, I don't think that Supertrend works."
"18472440","18473620"," I never used that one."
"18474480","18475980"," But I like MACD right down here. "
"18478080","18479100"," It's such a..."
"18479100","18479960"," It's so bad."
"18480240","18481340"," It doesn't work well."
"18481820","18484180"," So I can't recommend this one. "
"18484680","18491620"," I feel like in a day trade, I feel like you can see it down here, right?"
"18491820","18495340"," There's a rip, right?"
"18497480","18498620"," See it right here, right?"
"18499140","18501380"," Small rip, right?"
"18502100","18502820"," See it right here?"
"18503520","18505260"," Small rip, right?"
"18506080","18511760"," So like in a one minute chart, you want to leave that on the background somewhere somewhere else?"
"18511960","18513960"," And you're like, yeah, we're kind of down there right now."
"18515320","18517540"," But it's a horrible indicator."
"18517900","18519280"," I can't recommend it ever. "
"18519860","18520580"," It's terrible."
"18521460","18525460"," It's like a fourth tier, fifth tier day trading tool."
"18526120","18528820"," I never ever show it in livestream for that reason. "
"18530880","18532120"," You can get smoked."
"18532800","18533900"," You have to..."
"18533900","18539440"," If you can promise yourself that you're not going to use it as your fucking album going long air."
"18541000","18549760"," I would really prefer you to be looking at levels and previous highs, previous lows, looking at"
"18549760","18555360"," book map, using moving averages, using retracement levels, any of that kind of stuff. "
"18556720","18558560"," Over ever using that indicator."
"18558940","18564690"," That should be like your last last we're going up kind of a thing."
"18570670","18573550"," Yeah, I don't want to show you guys. "
"18573550","18581170"," I hate showing that indicator because it is probably the most..."
"18582290","18583750"," It's how you get torched."
"18587490","18592690"," It's straight up how you get torched is the RSI on the one minute."
"18593470","18594370"," But I do leave it on. "
"18595470","18596350"," I leave it on."
"18597070","18599630"," I'm going to tab with it open somewhere or not somewhere."
"18599850","18603510"," I leave another tab open with gamma levels too on SPX. "
"18604270","18606710"," So I've got SPX with gamma levels on it every day."
"18607250","18609250"," I look at it and once we're below..."
"18609250","18614150"," Once we get in a bad game, like negative gamma, not just pivot, but like below R."
"18614350","18615510"," So this here..."
"18616070","18620490"," Remember earlier today when I said to you, when we hit below this S1, what did I say this morning"
"18620490","18620730"," to you?"
"18620810","18622930"," I said, we're going the fuck down, right?"
"18623230","18624250"," And that's what's happened, right?"
"18624390","18628330"," We've gone down into this afternoon."
"18633630","18635490"," Does that make sense to you all out there?"
"18639200","18640000"," Anytime the vid. "
"18645960","18647260"," Here, let me post it."
"18647600","18650660"," Let me do the R..."
"18651220","18651800"," What's it called?"
"18653060","18653720"," Is it pivot point?"
"18654260","18654880"," I see it right there."
"18656940","18658520"," Is this the one that you're talking about right here?"
"18658880","18660180"," Let me draw it and see what it says. "
"18662700","18664500"," So this is the..."
"18664500","18669770"," This is the yellow line."
"18669950","18671730"," This is what they are saying the levels are here."
"18676310","18678550"," So these are the levels from..."
"18681050","18681570"," Weebel. "
"18684740","18687360"," There's S1, there's R1, my R1."
"18687740","18689860"," S1 is not, S2 is not, and S3 is not."
"18691980","18693380"," There's R2 and R3. "
"18694800","18695700"," So the comparison."
"18696400","18698140"," I don't know if you can adjust this though, can you?"
"18701040","18701800"," Link 15."
"18705950","18707510"," Let's see if we can..."
"18711630","18712550"," I've never used this. "
"18721970","18723770"," It doesn't seem like it's making much of a difference."
"18729120","18729880"," I don't..."
"18731640","18732620"," I've never used it."
"18749140","18751240"," I just changed the link that didn't do anything. "
"18752320","18753060"," Let me check."
"18754800","18757180"," What does work pretty good is the favorite..."
"18757180","18758540"," The temperature retracement works pretty good."
"18759380","18760660"," It's pretty close, fast, quick. "
"18763880","18765860"," The trend channel I've never used."
"18767920","18768480"," I don't think I have."
"18769380","18772300"," I think I've gone through all of these at least once. "
"18773480","18774560"," I think I have."
"18774560","18776440"," I think I've gone through all of these at least once."
"18781260","18782580"," You can do this on your own. "
"18784500","18785460"," Dude, I'm telling you."
"18785880","18786720"," I'm telling you."
"18786840","18790920"," If you're out there and you're paying for light speed or anything like that, I guarantee if you put"
"18790920","18793920"," this chart up next to it, it's just as fucking good. "
"18794520","18794980"," It's free."
"18798900","18802180"," I do all research on Thinkorswim and TradingView."
"18802640","18806420"," They have some kick-ass tools on both of those platforms. "
"18806420","18808380"," You should be signing up for all this shit."
"18809460","18818220"," Then you execute my trades on Tasty, but if you're buying GME stock, you should be doing that on a"
"18818220","18820280"," prime bank brokerage."
"18821080","18824820"," If you're trading options, you can do wherever you feel most comfortable. "
"18837980","18838640"," Hey, buddy."
"18839940","18841820"," Happy holidays if you're just joining us right now."
"18842880","18843420"," I'm flat. "
"18843580","18844240"," I'm just sitting here."
"18846300","18848280"," I want to buy this down below here if I can."
"18848780","18850800"," If the bears can get me, this will be a very happy man. "
"18852640","18855660"," I did play some quick calls up here."
"18855880","18856540"," Got stopped out."
"18857520","18859200"," Made like nine cents up here. "
"18864290","18865870"," I'll show you guys book map real quick."
"18868070","18873710"," The only reason why I use Weevil is because it's like every platform that you use or every"
"18873710","18877410"," brokerage that you try out, you're like, oh, I really like this thing about this brokerage."
"18878590","18880290"," You're like, I really like this thing about book map. "
"18880570","18882490"," You can play trades through book map too."
"18883130","18886910"," So there's like all these things that you like, but then there's other shit that you're like, I"
"18886910","18888770"," don't fucking need all that other stuff."
"18889770","18893630"," And there's no real perfect charting and no perfect software. "
"18894450","18903490"," I don't think that there is."
"18903490","18905910"," I'm saying next buy level to watch is a seven eight seven."
"18907890","18909030"," It's right down here. "
"18915850","18917170"," Some good volume in here though."
"18917990","18919890"," You can't deny that there was a volume down here."
"18919970","18920530"," You can see it. "
"18923050","18924390"," Some big volume down here."
"18924590","18928490"," I wouldn't."
"18928490","18930250"," This is almost that capitulation. "
"18931510","18933150"," Almost that capitulation."
"18937410","18942110"," And you know, bears look at this from this perspective right here."
"18942990","18944290"," Trying to tee off. "
"18948830","18950490"," Get aggressive down here."
"18950790","18951350"," Oh, look at that."
"18951650","18952350"," Look at how that. "
"18952650","18953930"," Look at how that just matches up."
"18954090","18954530"," Isn't that wild?"
"18955170","18955930"," That neat."
"18957210","18957770"," Shocker. "
"18961710","18962270"," Shocker."
"18962870","18965850"," Somehow that line is almost perfect into the bell."
"18967070","18972190"," I don't think we get there, but it's interesting how it's almost symmetrical. "
"18974730","18976250"," Good morning, Jasmine."
"18976610","18976910"," How are you?"
"18977450","18977790"," Happy holidays."
"18981110","18984430"," Yeah, big BGO is the 20 EMA in the five minute chart. "
"18987170","18988570"," You guys want to see that one now?"
"18989370","18990390"," I'll put it back on that one."
"18990490","18990710"," That's the."
"18996390","18997630"," All credit goes to. "
"18999830","19003490"," Our man, Jedi Marcus on that on that indicator."
"19015690","19017810"," And he calls it the big green line."
"19018150","19019590"," I think that's what he uses a green line. "
"19028850","19037170"," Oh, you're a baby."
"19040430","19045270"," Big green line, 20 X potential, X potential moving average."
"19053550","19055450"," If you don't follow him, follow him. "
"19055570","19056330"," He's on Twitter."
"19057210","19058650"," Should I mark a 77?"
"19060070","19061850"," Twenty two zero."
"19062890","19063790"," Two zero. "
"19064570","19066550"," I'm a hundred percent sure on that."
"19067450","19068210"," Two zero."
"19076430","19078270"," Two zero. "
"19081110","19081990"," Two zero."
"19090270","19094010"," It could be the twenty one, but I remember being the two zero."
"19094990","19095850"," Two zero. "
"19098350","19100350"," Actually, this is the five minute on it."
"19102370","19103610"," Look at that, it's just monster."
"19110350","19111330"," That's the five minute. "
"19115470","19116790"," This is it on the one minute."
"19118150","19119230"," Just teeing off."
"19131370","19137290"," If you want to move your screen around this little auto button on the bottom right hand side,"
"19137290","19139770"," you'll see an auto button that says auto Y axis. "
"19140910","19144870"," When you highlight it, when you scroll over, it's a little button down the bottom right hand side"
"19144870","19145390"," says auto."
"19146210","19147690"," You scroll over, it says auto Y axis."
"19147690","19150950"," You click it and you can move your screen wherever you want. "
"19151670","19160290"," If you put your cursor over here, you can make your screen look really nasty and vicious."
"19172320","19175820"," If you want to like drill down in the minute charge, I shouldn't be."
"19177120","19178680"," I think it's twenty, dude. "
"19179680","19181540"," I mean, I'm almost positive, it's twenty."
"19188620","19191200"," Go look at the paper and tell me because I want to know if I'm wrong on that."
"19191520","19192140"," I think it's twenty. "
"19198660","19200040"," I'm almost positive, it's twenty."
"19201760","19202560"," Let me go look right now."
"19204200","19205780"," I think I have the white paper somewhere. "
"19207540","19209320"," Let me see if I have it here."
"19216980","19219260"," I'll double check and see if it's the twenty, it could be wrong."
"19221200","19222360"," I've been known to be wrong. "
"19226560","19227460"," Let me look."
"19234040","19235200"," Didn't I post it on?"
"19236280","19237300"," Oh, here you go, I got it."
"19237640","19238220"," Let me look and see. "
"19240740","19242220"," Twenty one period, I'm wrong."
"19242760","19243620"," I am dead fucking wrong."
"19244180","19244960"," Twenty one period. "
"19245920","19247240"," So I've got mine set to twenty."
"19248380","19252960"," So let me set mine to twenty one."
"19252960","19254000"," Hold on here. "
"19260200","19261840"," Yeah, I've got mine set to twenty one."
"19262500","19264020"," So now it's twenty one."
"19264360","19265120"," So I was wrong. "
"19265840","19266820"," I was big time wrong."
"19270240","19271760"," You want to see the difference in that?"
"19276260","19278440"," Is there a little bit of a difference there?"
"19285020","19286360"," That's in a one minute chart though."
"19286460","19287740"," Let's go look at it on a..."
"19289000","19289640"," I was wrong. "
"19290500","19291180"," I have to apologize."
"19291620","19292640"," I've been telling people it's the twenty."
"19293920","19294520"," Now he'll know it. "
"19294700","19295720"," Now he'll know it was me."
"19297280","19297980"," Pull out a second."
"19297980","19299380"," He'll be like twenty. "
"19299860","19300580"," It's twenty one."
"19300900","19301740"," Who's telling you that?"
"19304880","19306620"," Well, let's see what the difference is."
"19307200","19308420"," That's the twenty one. "
"19309220","19310260"," Twenty two."
"19310380","19310860"," Twenty three."
"19311080","19311620"," Twenty four. "
"19311740","19312320"," Twenty five."
"19312460","19312980"," Twenty six."
"19313640","19314820"," Twenty seven. "
"19315180","19315640"," Twenty eight."
"19316020","19316440"," Twenty nine."
"19316960","19319080"," Thirty one. "
"19319560","19321280"," That's actually pretty sweet right there."
"19323740","19327780"," Looks like on the downslope the thirty five is kind of cool."
"19331800","19332540"," Forty two. "
"19332720","19333340"," Forty five."
"19337340","19340720"," I guess if you were bearish you'd want to jump back and forth."
"19341560","19346320"," I wonder if I should do like a forty five and then a..."
"19347280","19349300"," See now you get me thinking that I'll do like another. "
"19349300","19352600"," I'll look at this after normal hours."
"19353700","19355700"," Maybe I'll have one for the..."
"19356680","19358120"," Maybe I'll do one that's slightly higher."
"19365460","19366080"," Like that. "
"19367800","19370200"," Like forty one on the one minute."
"19370340","19371240"," That's a five minute chart."
"19371540","19371680"," Hold on. "
"19373840","19374640"," Now you get me all."
"19375680","19376660"," Now you get me one minute."
"19376860","19378100"," Now you got me wanting to mess with. "
"19380460","19380980"," EMA's."
"19382560","19383340"," Hold on here."
"19385800","19388240"," Drop that one down right there. "
"19389600","19390820"," That's the twenty five EMA."
"19391000","19392160"," EMA and the one minute chart."
"19397940","19400700"," Let me go look at the other side of this. "
"19401240","19401800"," Hold on here."
"19403700","19404800"," When we're going up."
"19405720","19408240"," That's a nice touch on the going up to right there. "
"19409160","19410180"," On the one minute."
"19411080","19412980"," There's a beautiful fucking touch down there."
"19415600","19416440"," Let me see. "
"19416740","19416940"," Hold on."
"19419100","19423820"," Let me just see something here."
"19433240","19440530"," See now you got me all like this one right there. "
"19447150","19447810"," Green."
"19450240","19452010"," The gas line in there."
"19454030","19454510"," No. "
"19455390","19456010"," Damn it."
"19459690","19460410"," What is that?"
"19460610","19460790"," Ten."
"19474150","19475430"," That's a cool one right there. "
"19485950","19486810"," That's a cool chart."
"19493530","19495950"," See that if you get the green crosses above the blue."
"19499930","19500810"," See it over here. "
"19503350","19505590"," Once that green comes above the blue."
"19506090","19506970"," You're blasting off."
"19509310","19510490"," See that green cross. "
"19514650","19516250"," That's kind of a cool indicator."
"19516710","19517270"," I like that one."
"19519530","19522150"," So if you're below the blue line, it's bad. "
"19523010","19524910"," Now makes gasoline January futures."
"19525190","19527050"," That's $3.17 a gallon."
"19527370","19530130"," These are futures at $3.05 a gallon. "
"19530850","19533390"," Now makes WTI crude January futures at $75."
"19533990","19537610"," That's a 90 cents or one spot to 1%."
"19537910","19543910"," And now makes natural gas January futures settling at $5.85. So if this green. "
"19549310","19550910"," So this stays blue."
"19553550","19554750"," And or."
"19564030","19567530"," So if this comes over, it starts going like that. "
"19567630","19568370"," That's what that would be."
"19569050","19570470"," So green below."
"19573250","19573850"," Right. "
"19574070","19575990"," Green above is going up."
"19576530","19577930"," Green below is going down."
"19582250","19585590"," But that's just basically following the fucking candlestick chart anyway. "
"19585910","19586390"," So I don't know."
"19586770","19588670"," It's basically just the fucking candles."
"19591170","19593410"," That's some video game shit right there, isn't it?"
"19598630","19600410"," So I'm going to get rid of that one. "
"19600830","19601590"," I like the 25."
"19604390","19607650"," So I switched to mines now in 25."
"19611250","19614310"," So hold on here. "
"19618830","19621830"," So this is the this is the one EMA."
"19623830","19625590"," I changed it down to a one."
"19626030","19627250"," I wish you could go negative. "
"19627390","19628630"," That'd be bad ass because negative."
"19638240","19639200"," You can't."
"19644700","19646460"," So I can see why it puts it lower. "
"19646800","19648020"," I can see why he's got 21."
"19648920","19650680"," I can see his logic behind it because."
"19652200","19654100"," He's given that chance for it to. "
"19655860","19656980"," Come, come under."
"19658420","19659700"," See why it's at the 21."
"19659860","19660220"," It makes sense. "
"19662100","19665080"," It's fucking around when it kind of gives you a better perspective, right?"
"19672690","19673570"," Now over here."
"19674310","19677110"," I got Jenny Marcus in my head man."
"19679290","19681790"," He's got me looking at all my indicators and so on. "
"19681890","19684350"," What should I be doing on this different time frame?"
"19690000","19692640"," I've got it posted in Captain's Alpha."
"19692860","19694220"," I've got the white paper on it."
"19694920","19697440"," So if you don't know what we're talking about, there's a."
"19697960","19699900"," It's really it's it wasn't done by like. "
"19701140","19701940"," Scientists or anything."
"19701940","19705120"," It was just some guy that wrote it to make it or wrote some math and said."
"19705860","19708120"," So many times it worked and so many times it didn't. "
"19710080","19711040"," He also said."
"19714680","19717360"," So he also let me show you what he said, which is pretty cool, right?"
"19717680","19719400"," I'm going to show you guys what he said in the paper."
"19719600","19721580"," I'm going to give you a basic understanding if you don't know. "
"19722560","19723400"," What he was saying."
"19723400","19727700"," So let's say you're running he's saying to run on the five minute chart."
"19729500","19731400"," So I'll show an example where it failed. "
"19731760","19732340"," So right here."
"19734660","19736400"," So this is an example where it failed."
"19740840","19746720"," So he's saying if you go if you go above the big green line, he would take this long right"
"19746720","19746920"," here. "
"19747400","19749260"," Now let's say you were long right here and it failed."
"19750900","19752780"," And it started to sell off."
"19754540","19756960"," He was saying he would then pick you would. "
"19757200","19762180"," I think he was saying you would stay long and then take this trade down below here."
"19764000","19766920"," And so you're making your money on the opposite side of the trade."
"19767260","19769100"," And then once you come above here. "
"19769900","19773340"," You try to exit the long that you got stuck in up here."
"19774120","19777120"," So basically what would mean would be you're long here."
"19777220","19779180"," The trade didn't continue, right?"
"19779860","19782280"," This trade down though makes you money. "
"19782920","19785820"," And this one here is kind of a wash."
"19786240","19787840"," So no matter what you're kind of left with."
"19789300","19791340"," Some of your trade that makes sense. "
"19791500","19792440"," So it's like a two part trade."
"19794120","19796480"," So the times when you go below the line."
"19797180","19799860"," There's a I think what the wind rate is on it, but it's pretty high. "
"19799860","19802620"," And then though if the trade goes against you."
"19805560","19809420"," You would take the opposite side of the trade, stay long and then get out of it over here."
"19809480","19810400"," But I think this is on futures. "
"19811380","19814540"," I don't think he's doing this on cash market."
"19816990","19818850"," If that makes sense."
"19819010","19821450"," I don't think you can do this in options, but I think you can do this in contracts. "
"19823130","19824910"," And it's a double it's a two sided trade."
"19831570","19833090"," And he runs it on the five minute."
"19834330","19837390"," So if you're running this in the five minute, you wouldn't take this. "
"19838770","19840170"," You would pick this up."
"19841970","19843370"," Until you trade it above."
"19845810","19846830"," That line, right?"
"19847010","19847790"," So you'd be looking for. "
"19849250","19850570"," Some kind of move higher."
"19851930","19856510"," And that's when you would pick the long side of the trade up, otherwise you're still in the short"
"19856510","19857150"," side of the trade."
"19858930","19859790"," And I don't think. "
"19860830","19862250"," I wouldn't use that."
"19862490","19864690"," Like you'd have to meet or you'd have to."
"19866250","19868770"," If you're going to do this with like options. "
"19871290","19875550"," And let's say you wanted to take this part of the trade, you have to have stops, right?"
"19876890","19882750"," So that if it reverses you, you, you, you don't get burned in the trade."
"19884390","19889570"," So as soon as you get over over the big blue line or whatever, big green line, you'd enter a"
"19889570","19892790"," long option and you'd have immediate stop there."
"19893690","19895230"," And try to trade that up. "
"19895370","19897530"," And the same thing would go for put side as well, right?"
"19899290","19900430"," So if you entered a put."
"19901390","19903470"," If you see us rejecting here."
"19904570","19908590"," You put stops right here in case the case the traded reversed on you. "
"19912590","19914650"," You have to modify it for whatever."
"19916730","19917730"," Whatever you're doing."
"19921860","19923820"," And that would probably work right here too, right?"
"19924040","19924880"," Put stops in right here. "
"19924960","19925420"," Make sure that."
"19928960","19930920"," You're keeping your buddy."
"19957060","19958580"," Yeah, I think the, I think the idea. "
"19958800","19963740"," So if you're going to, if you do it with contracts on futures and Globax, you'd be on both sides"
"19963740","19964180"," of the trade."
"19964440","19965460"," If you're going to do it on."
"19967520","19970940"," Options, if you're going to take the trade over the line going up or down. "
"19971420","19976340"," That's when you would put your stop on is immediately when you take that trade."
"19978760","19981220"," I don't know if he mostly focuses on SPX."
"19982220","19982820"," I'm unsure. "
"19992700","19994100"," No, I just need more coffee."
"19995020","19997700"," I'm yawning because I've only been drinking water."
"19997960","19999120"," I stopped drinking coffee this morning. "
"19999200","20000340"," I should have more coffee."
"20003780","20004480"," It's the hall."
"20004640","20005580"," I was thinking about that. "
"20007160","20011060"," Tony, I was thinking I was walking down a flight of stairs last night."
"20011280","20015340"," And I was like, I was like, you know what?"
"20015660","20016380"," Every holiday."
"20016840","20018540"," I think it's going to be vacation. "
"20019740","20023440"," And then I realized that like your wife needs stuff."
"20023620","20024540"," Your children needs stuff."
"20024760","20025620"," Your friends needs stuff. "
"20025880","20027520"," Your family needs stuff."
"20027520","20034640"," And then people stop by and then you never get rest or relaxation."
"20051680","20054560"," It's the big green line. "
"20056000","20060860"," I posted it on at Captain's Alpha a couple of days ago last week sometime."
"20064220","20066680"," And you can always go there and read the paper."
"20066960","20067680"," There's a link to it. "
"20069640","20071400"," Here, you're going to link to it right now for you."
"20071760","20072080"," Hold on."
"20072180","20073120"," I'll link to it right now for you. "
"20074540","20077380"," I will post it in the."
"20080460","20081120"," Me a second."
"20081260","20081960"," I'll post it for you guys. "
"20087920","20089500"," It is me a second here."
"20100020","20101480"," There's a link to it right there."
"20104000","20105160"," So you can read through it. "
"20105980","20108440"," It would need to be modified, I think, for."
"20111080","20111400"," Trading options."
"20112600","20115160"," If you were longing the underlying. "
"20116280","20118640"," You'd have to be able to sort the underlying at the same time."
"20121040","20123140"," Or if you were doing contracts on ES."
"20171960","20173400"," Trading with manual stops cost. "
"20173680","20174540"," Yeah, I would never."
"20174900","20175300"," I don't trade."
"20175800","20175880"," I know. "
"20176120","20181820"," I've heard I just read something where people said you lose money on limit stops."
"20182200","20183000"," That's fucking wrong."
"20183640","20184880"," That is absolutely wrong. "
"20185040","20185740"," I disagree with that."
"20185740","20188620"," If you know the direction you're going, stops are fucking awesome."
"20189940","20191880"," I don't know why people say don't trade with stops. "
"20192560","20193340"," Stops are like."
"20194460","20195820"," Unless your finger is on the trigger."
"20197000","20198900"," Even then like the mental part of it. "
"20199900","20202940"," You just put a manual stop and you just raise your rate."
"20203460","20205900"," Like let's say you enter something at 50 cents and it goes up."
"20206400","20206960"," I try to watch. "
"20207240","20207780"," I try not to."
"20208340","20209940"," I shouldn't say I put a stop immediately but."
"20209940","20211580"," I try to. "
"20212140","20214820"," If let's say enter a position in the right in the right direction."
"20215720","20220100"," And let's say it's like starts at 50 cents and goes to 60 and then it comes back down."
"20222560","20224120"," I initially I'll take. "
"20225440","20228160"," If I enter a trade it's like 50 cents let's say right."
"20229980","20232500"," I'm I'm taking risk on so."
"20233500","20237960"," I want to at least let it go down to 10 or 20% of the trade. "
"20238960","20240200"," Some people don't."
"20240960","20245500"," But let's say it's 50 cents and you put a stop on it immediately at 48 cents right."
"20246460","20251040"," Or 45 cents and it goes up to from 50 to 60 cents. "
"20251600","20253080"," You'll see it fluctuate back down."
"20253220","20255940"," You'll see it like 60 to 55 to 52 to 50."
"20256380","20257220"," Back up to 52. "
"20257960","20259140"," Sometimes they go like 49 cents."
"20259400","20261580"," There's never actually never do fives and zeros."
"20261740","20264480"," I always do like a penny below my stop. "
"20265740","20268380"," Right because of the bid ask especially on spiders like a bid ask."
"20269780","20272220"," You like hit round numbers oftentimes."
"20272840","20278120"," Now but if we go up from like 50 cents to 63 cents and I start bounce around the 60s. "
"20278580","20283520"," I'll go from I'll go from the 50s right to 60 and let it bounce around the 60s to the"
"20283520","20284100"," 70s."
"20284540","20287720"," Once it's in the 70s bouncing around I'll move it up to the 70s."
"20289320","20290700"," Sometimes they get stopped out. "
"20290700","20292060"," Sometimes they make 10%."
"20292600","20293560"," Sometimes they make 20%."
"20293560","20296320"," Sometimes I make 100 200 300. "
"20299500","20301780"," If I'm getting a million little cuts in a day."
"20302120","20304800"," I just stopped taking trades and waiting for it to work itself out."
"20305260","20307780"," I would mean that I'm over trading when I shouldn't be right. "
"20313830","20315110"," Market price almost there."
"20315390","20316790"," You guys are getting an email this week."
"20316870","20321030"," We're going to do a private class on it because we're getting close. "
"20322210","20326170"," I want you guys to see what you're looking for for a true bottom."
"20329830","20330810"," Squeeze and hire now."
"20334840","20338820"," I want you guys to see what a true bottom looks like. "
"20340180","20343620"," I want you guys to do the best part of when I do these trades."
"20345500","20346940"," You guys are here right now."
"20347180","20349360"," I guarantee you the day that I take that trade. "
"20350380","20352240"," The entire stream is going to say."
"20352240","20354560"," I don't think so, Cap."
"20356780","20357920"," I think this is when we crash. "
"20358400","20358920"," I guarantee it."
"20359040","20360880"," The day that I take that trade, that's what people are going to say."
"20361460","20363900"," It's going to be a bloodbath the day that I take it. "
"20364520","20365680"," Every time it's a bloodbath."
"20370140","20370980"," Squeeze and hire now."
"20385340","20387600"," This should be your stop loss if you're a bear. "
"20388540","20390860"," There's your stop loss right there."
"20393600","20396260"," This should have triggered you right if you were a bear in short here."
"20397340","20399340"," You should have no reason to be losing money. "
"20402280","20405260"," Yeah, you'll see it."
"20405800","20407500"," We'll be in stream and hands down."
"20408240","20410220"," People will be saying don't take that fucking trade. "
"20410220","20411500"," I'll be like I'm fucking taking it."
"20412220","20413660"," It's usually when we're most fearful."
"20413900","20415840"," It's usually when things are really ugly. "
"20416560","20418260"," It's usually like really big bloodbath."
"20419840","20421660"," Like two, three levels in a day."
"20422040","20422960"," Two, three levels in a day. "
"20423240","20424080"," Two, three levels in a day."
"20424360","20426500"," It's usually the end of a down cycle."
"20428020","20431820"," And again, like someone said earlier, see Dan Niles come out and say we had to buy the market. "
"20431980","20432460"," We have no choice."
"20451160","20454240"," So bears need to get back underneath this yellow line, right?"
"20454520","20456180"," If you're a bear, you want to be snapping these."
"20457760","20459140"," Snap another one right here. "
"20465520","20469040"," I'm going to get back under here and own this shit."
"20475520","20476820"," It should be illegal for spy."
"20477000","20477600"," We'd have to do it. "
"20477760","20478240"," Today's the row."
"20478500","20480080"," It's just been down for a while now, right?"
"20480280","20481000"," For more than two days."
"20484920","20485540"," Slayers, though. "
"20485660","20486400"," Then the less."
"20499080","20500520"," It's the way we look right here."
"20500820","20501700"," Sorry for the yawning. "
"20502160","20502720"," I need more coffee."
"20503640","20506080"," I wish my kids would do that for me."
"20507200","20508620"," They bring me coffee in the day. "
"20514740","20518260"," Brand crude features settle at $79.80 a barrel."
"20518600","20521560"," That's up 76 cents or spot 96%."
"20523260","20524360"," What are you about there?"
"20534080","20535500"," No, not so much guru. "
"20537420","20539240"," It's a little bit of liquidity grab here brother."
"20553180","20554640"," I'm still watching that guru."
"20557140","20559460"," That is still the way of the day so far. "
"20578020","20579420"," We're a negative gavager."
"20579700","20580460"," It's pretty ugly."
"20585160","20587300"," Big squeezes, selling. "
"20592510","20596310"," I do warn you though, if you are a bear, you see this."
"20596310","20600310"," I want to show you real quick what that is."
"20600530","20604470"," If you are a bearish here, give me a second. "
"20605270","20605930"," I just want you to be aware."
"20610800","20618540"," Just as we head down here into $375, it can go a little bit deeper, like $373.50 or so."
"20620560","20623740"," I want to show you what this is down here. "
"20631020","20633420"," I'm going to show you why."
"20633960","20638020"," Maybe there's someone out there that doesn't."
"20642250","20650690"," Just down in here, going to see where this demand is or was. "
"20656970","20658270"," Why is that not showing?"
"20661190","20661730"," Okay."
"20664050","20668580"," It can kind of walk you here."
"20674760","20684560"," Just so you can see, this is the low that needs to be tested by bears"
"20684560","20685060"," down here. "
"20685060","20687860"," It's a 3.48 or so."
"20689620","20696820"," 3.48.12. If you are a bear, you want to be looking at."
"20698940","20702060"," There was push right here, right?"
"20703060","20705240"," There was push right here or demand. "
"20706160","20708000"," It's demand right here, right?"
"20708960","20714160"," Some demand right here and demand right here and some demand right here."
"20715400","20719600"," You know that the bulls last stand is right here."
"20720520","20725220"," You kind of know that we're coming into some kind of demand down here. "
"20725340","20730160"," The US State Department says the toll of the virus in China is of concern to the world, given the"
"20730160","20731020"," size of its economy."
"20731020","20738360"," So you're going to be looking for, you know, as we stretch down here."
"20739340","20741340"," So this is the gap close, right?"
"20742060","20743440"," This is S3 down here. "
"20744160","20749640"," You're going to expect something down there that's, you know, be wary of."
"20749900","20752460"," And then down here, you're going to be wary of this gap."
"20752760","20754140"," I mean, this is getting closed. "
"20755120","20760880"," But as you start stretching this stuff, the whiplash is violent at some point."
"20762440","20765380"," So just be conscious of it as you come down here."
"20766520","20768820"," There's some, you know, there's another one down here. "
"20772390","20777210"," These are usually areas of you get ticked in the teeth or something."
"20778410","20783190"," One house press secretary, Jean P.S., says Biden is to sign the defense policy bill later this"
"20783190","20783410"," week."
"20784250","20785650"," So everyone heard where that is, right?"
"20785890","20787430"," That's right down in here. "
"20790660","20795340"," That's right down with with this little green boxes that I'm showing you."
"20796920","20798480"," We're coming down in there right now."
"20798640","20801960"," So you got to be careful of that trade. "
"20805420","20811520"," And that's right here."
"20812220","20812940"," So we're getting close."
"20828500","20830260"," There's the gap close right down here. "
"20838140","20839380"," I'm going to assume that."
"20870230","20871750"," I'm getting itchy to buy some calls."
"20872010","20872950"," I'm not going to lie to you. "
"20906220","20911540"," Like 386 is for December 23rd."
"20912700","20914600"," Early 97 cents."
"20917440","20920660"," 386 is for December 23rd. "
"20921480","20922480"," Right here for December 23rd."
"20923160","20924900"," Early 97 cents."
"20925120","20926420"," It's pretty fucking cheap. "
"20928360","20931720"," So I'm looking at, I'm looking at Christmas calls over here."
"20937840","20940160"," Yeah, we're not, I mean."
"20942600","20943780"," It's getting close. "
"20944000","20944580"," It's getting like."
"20946400","20950100"," You don't know if there's a hidden order in here that's not showing itself."
"20952420","20953300"," It's close. "
"20954960","20956700"," Just looking back in time."
"20958560","20962920"," This is what you're looking for for a bottom down here or some kind of a retracement trade coming"
"20962920","20963160"," up."
"20964660","20965660"," It's really close. "
"20968460","20969520"," Only a retracement."
"20975680","20977080"," Let me take a look at the."
"20977920","20981540"," Let me see if the if the old men have sold out of. "
"20985510","20986310"," XLU yet."
"20986770","20988790"," XLU I think was the biggest one that is."
"20988930","20990390"," They're still fucking sitting in which. "
"20990850","20992510"," This is me after the wind."
"20993270","20999130"," The US State Department referring to earlier comments from Putin and Lukashenko Belarus as well."
"20999470","21000430"," Yeah, so we're still there. "
"21000570","21004030"," If there's a Putin statement on Belarus has to be treated as the height of irony as he is seeking"
"21004030","21004850"," to absorb Ukraine."
"21007610","21009190"," We're still not there yet."
"21010810","21013690"," You still see this is the thing when you're like. "
"21014870","21017070"," We're close, but we're not close enough."
"21019310","21020910"," Like they're still in utilities."
"21022970","21028370"," Still sitting in utilities, you know, still kind of, you know, you need to be down here a little"
"21028370","21028770"," bit more. "
"21029810","21031790"," Still not quite there."
"21032650","21034110"," That's the weekly hold on the wrong one."
"21035290","21036090"," Okay, a second. "
"21036270","21036930"," Maybe we are down there."
"21042130","21043370"," Yeah, we're still not down there."
"21043370","21044090"," Yeah. "
"21045070","21048790"," We're now at a 36.7. You need utilities."
"21050290","21052950"," So you need utilities of a fucking bloodbath."
"21054630","21056650"," They're not, they haven't bloodbath yet. "
"21057670","21059090"," Let's go look at XLU."
"21059670","21061030"," These little shits and that."
"21061290","21063790"," These are all like portfolio managers. "
"21067860","21070000"," You never trust a portfolio manager."
"21070780","21071860"," See down here?"
"21077090","21078330"," Oh, yeah, this is where you."
"21078790","21080230"," That's where it is down here. "
"21082470","21083590"," You need this."
"21084290","21085250"," I'm so bad."
"21086230","21088070"," You need this bloodbath down here. "
"21090770","21091370"," And these."
"21092790","21095170"," Tank portfolio managers won't give it up."
"21095310","21097410"," It's like sell, sell, sell, sell, please. "
"21098030","21099030"," So I can buy a dip."
"21099690","21100630"," Sell this right here."
"21105200","21107140"," We looked at XLU last week, right?"
"21107320","21107720"," You guys remember. "
"21108840","21110120"," We looked at, we looked at XLU."
"21115350","21117390"," I just want that bloodbath right there."
"21118010","21119050"," I want that gap closed. "
"21122550","21123290"," That's what I want."
"21123890","21124950"," You see that happen."
"21125150","21126310"," We'll find a local bottom. "
"21157910","21160790"," So those three eighties were 20 cents yesterday."
"21161030","21163490"," They're now $1.46 on Friday."
"21163710","21165710"," They were on Friday 3D. "
"21166110","21167110"," P's for today."
"21167910","21172790"," We're up 5, 6, 700% today."
"21173990","21175690"," So we had taken that trade in Friday. "
"21187910","21190390"," It does, but XLU is typically the last one."
"21192010","21193770"," It'll move along with XLV."
"21195530","21197450"," The real bleed is XLU. "
"21197610","21201730"," You want to XLU is typically the last sector to bleed out."
"21204230","21206710"," Usually the last sector is XLU."
"21217800","21219020"," It's almost there. "
