"37060","38000"," Hey, good morning."
"39020","40080"," Good morning, Jake."
"40260","41280"," Good morning, Gladen Estau. "
"41560","42420"," Good morning, your wife's boyfriend."
"42420","43300"," Good morning, Chaz."
"44400","46140"," Good morning, Joshua, Terry Santini. "
"46920","47220"," Good morning."
"49380","50540"," Is everybody doing out there?"
"51800","52960"," Good morning, Teagan."
"54840","57580"," Hey, is everybody doing out there?"
"60620","64319"," Let's go, your wife's boyfriend right now on Anthony Good morning, Stephen Good morning. "
"64920","65900"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"67540","69800"," Never a dull moment in these markets, huh?"
"72240","74920"," I had a dentist appointment yesterday morning."
"75180","75860"," I looked at the market."
"77220","77740"," It was sideways. "
"80160","82260"," And then it sold the fuck off."
"83100","85720"," I was like, what the hell's going on?"
"88220","89300"," How are you guys doing?"
"89600","90040"," Good to see you."
"90120","90960"," Yeah, we're back now. "
"91500","92440"," It's kind of weird too."
"92660","95080"," Good morning, Paul, Casey, Fisted."
"96000","97020"," Hey, Eric, how are you?"
"97940","100220"," L.R., Lucy, good morning, Joshua, good morning. "
"100460","101680"," Hope everybody's doing well out there."
"103040","104740"," So we got a lot to talk about this morning."
"105980","108440"," There's never a dull moment in this market right now, is there?"
"108920","110680"," We have a ton to look at. "
"112820","115740"," I'm good with just both John Ketch and the both way counts."
"117460","117860"," Absolutely."
"118360","119380"," We're going to talk about that this morning. "
"119480","121820"," We have a lot to talk about this morning."
"122460","123560"," So we're going to get right into it."
"124040","126600"," I don't even know if I can get this. "
"127440","128660"," Is that louder or not?"
"128880","129199"," I don't know."
"129960","131200"," We're just going to switch right over here."
"131260","131760"," We're not going to wait. "
"134740","135880"," I'm just going to switch right over here."
"136620","137140"," All right."
"137700","140040"," We have a lot to do before 9.30 this morning. "
"140820","147120"," So we were, we traded down into, let me see, Wednesday into Thursday on warfare's, right?"
"147360","153480"," Just use warfare's or warfare is being used for bullshit, right?"
"154240","159500"," We know that we already knew all the information that came out of the FOMC minutes, right?"
"159500","167940"," And we know that this is hard to explain, but we know that the minutes were actually bullish,"
"168080","169720"," believe it or not, if you're a bull, right?"
"170100","171100"," This is keep this clean."
"171780","180400"," If you're a bull, the minutes were not bullish, but they were dovish on rates, the markets, our"
"180400","182380"," country, our economy and everything."
"183120","186640"," We were looking for something more hawkish for sure in those minutes. "
"186640","194300"," Now, those minutes have been turned into, well, they're so dovish that it's hawkish on the market,"
"194360","194680"," right?"
"194880","196600"," So that's kind of what's taken place."
"197200","203560"," And as there's been a script flip, if we'd heard how to BPS in those minutes, if we'd heard real"
"203560","206060"," hawkish statements, the market would have sold off."
"206580","212920"," So we heard dovish comments, believe it or not, no matter what your social media is telling you,"
"212920","219120"," and that in turn is even more hawkish supposedly than if they had released hawkish comments, right?"
"219500","222680"," Now, so we're going to dump the market is the story. "
"223140","228160"," So we can see that the minutes are being used for dumping the market regardless, so that's key to"
"228160","228440"," understand."
"229220","235460"," And then we know that all the information about war, whether there's war or not war, anything is"
"235460","236620"," all bullshit as well, right?"
"236620","238400"," And just bring it up when they want to."
"238660","245340"," You can see that even the White House has keyed in on making this more of a story than it"
"245340","247100"," actually is when they want to, right?"
"247220","249940"," When it's a key moment to make it a story. "
"250060","253860"," It's almost like it's being used to wrangle in, believe it or not, the stock market, or at least"
"253860","257040"," the stock market is using it to wrangle in the market."
"257459","261600"," So we're going to go through some key points about this this morning before we get started."
"261600","267900"," And we're going to look at, first of all, where we are on the market profile, the volume profile,"
"268160","268240"," right?"
"268480","272900"," So I just want you to see where we are at the open this morning, okay?"
"273020","276800"," We're trying to claw our way back to a value area low on the 15 day. "
"277080","279280"," We know that there's just single prints down below."
"279780","280960"," We're hanging by a thread."
"281720","284280"," And at any moment, this market could sell off. "
"284280","290600"," We could sell up today on the open and then continue our move down to 435 or even lower, right?"
"290600","293900"," We know that 435 is some kind of a support right now."
"294440","297900"," I'm sure that there's some bulls out there saying, hey, we can trade at least up to point of"
"297900","302140"," control up here to 450 and at least trade up into here into this 440."
"302640","308420"," We'll look at the charts because the charts kind of look like they'll try to wrangle it back up to"
"308420","310680"," a point of control in the market over the last 15 days. "
"310960","315680"," If you look at a longer profile chart on the market, it's pretty ugly."
"315960","317680"," It's not pretty where we are right now."
"317680","319440"," I just want you to see where we are right now. "
"319540","322340"," I guess that would be that we trade somewhere in here today, right?"
"322660","328220"," We trade up here to this for we'll look at another chart here, but that we have monthly opeks and"
"328220","330080"," they want to wrangle this chart to where it needs to be."
"330660","334300"," We also know I'm going to show you some of the things right now that I want to talk to"
"334300","341800"," you about because yesterday the hair indicator was telling a different story versus what actually"
"341800","342820"," took place, right?"
"343740","345840"," So which was kind of an odd thing yesterday."
"347000","350900"," So we're going to take a look at that real quick and before we get there, we're just going to"
"350900","354240"," look at what we're going to look first look at for today, right?"
"354820","356720"," We've got a brainard speaking at 130. "
"357120","362200"," We've got Williams speaking at 11 a.m. We've got Waller speaking at 10 15 leading economic"
"362200","367440"," indicators at 10 a.m. We've got existing home sales at 10 and we've got the hole in here."
"368940","372720"," We've got the Chicago Booth School, New York Fed meeting meetings all day long."
"372860","374640"," I'm assuming that includes all these people talking. "
"375020","376640"," So we still have another volatile day."
"376820","382880"," I was just looking at some news saying that there's even more fighting going on in Ukraine right"
"382880","383700"," now, believe it or not."
"383940","390040"," I'm looking at some stories that are saying, I don't know if these have been out there yet or not,"
"390160","390600"," but it's saying. "
"391780","396240"," President Macron saying the situation in Don Bass has been very worrying in recent hours."
"396720","398540"," We've seen reports of several casualties."
"399660","403520"," They'll hold more talks later today, but you can see the markets not selling off at this moment. "
"404020","406060"," So I guess it's not that fucking serious, right?"
"406160","411420"," When it comes down to fear in the market, just being used as a tool, as an excuse for why"
"411420","412180"," we sell the market."
"412180","414660"," Remember, also on Monday, we are closed."
"415440","417980"," We've got the Schiller case on Tuesday. "
"418680","422540"," We don't have nothing on Monday, but on Tuesday, we've got a bunch of stuff coming out PMI."
"422920","424560"," We've got nothing scheduled for Wednesday."
"424560","425620"," We got claims on Thursday. "
"426660","431160"," We've got gross domestic products, which is important down here to the revision."
"431720","436560"," They've got personal income on Friday of next week on the earnings calendar."
"436560","441500"," Everything is out for today, but when we're closed on Monday, we've got Home Depot on Tuesday to"
"441500","442300"," pay attention to that. "
"442420","446080"," I think Macy's sold off, and I think Medtronic sold off as well."
"446520","450360"," We've got Cracker Barrel, Krispy Kreme, big ones you want to know about."
"450780","453900"," And then we can look ahead to Wednesday as well. "
"454400","457680"," I'll try to get the intern and pump out some of these before the weekend's over."
"457860","459160"," We've got Lowe's, TJX."
"459740","463060"," We've got Overstock coming out next week, Jack in the box. "
"465300","469200"," Molson, we've got next week on Wednesday, and then on Thursday, we'll just look at Thursday and"
"469200","469980"," continue on."
"470360","471140"," Baba, right?"
"471300","472220"," Did they get wrecked yesterday?"
"472380","475460"," I haven't checked yet, but I think Baba might have gotten wrecked yesterday."
"475540","480800"," We got Myrna, Nicola, Wayfair, one of the most heavily shorted stocks out there, Six Flags. "
"481680","487020"," So I'll get some of this stuff posted to you later today, but the key point is this."
"487020","495000"," I want to talk about, I think this was Wednesday's, I think this was Wednesday's, the evening"
"495000","495380"," report."
"495560","496700"," Let me see if I get this date right here. "
"497360","501180"," This is Thursday's evening report, but it's important for us to go through this, okay?"
"502040","507580"," On the heels of renewed Ukraine concerns hawkish remarks by Fed rep's markets traded lower."
"509180","510980"," Options were bid and implied volatility."
"510980","513039"," Metrics rose accordingly to note. "
"513240","518140"," However, Spock is hedging impact real-time options to get a hero revealed a divergence, right?"
"518740","520159"," The hero indicator was green yesterday."
"520720","525060"," Early on this, or at least until noon time, I think, early in the session, participants sold put"
"525060","530740"," options in bot calls actively dried shortly after 11.30 AM, right around St. Louis Fed, President"
"530740","535160"," Bullard scheduled to speak with the monthly options expiration removal of hedges to put heavy"
"535160","536400"," exposures may support the market."
"536400","537340"," That is absent. "
"537880","542160"," Some exogenous catalyst infusing the round of selling demand downside protection."
"542200","545100"," If that were to happen, positions, conditions favor more volatility."
"546120","547000"," I'm not important. "
"547400","548540"," What is important though is this."
"549860","551260"," Let me see."
"553100","558420"," Okay, so the expansion and volatility alongside this real money selling, okay?"
"558840","563960"," This is the key point I want to make to you is that yesterday was not driven by options. "
"563960","567900"," It was driven by real money selling in the market."
"568660","575900"," Now, this key point right here has come up at key points in the market recently going back to late"
"575900","576420"," January."
"576920","583540"," Whenever Spock and his reports are wrong, which they were, right, then they covered up and say they"
"583540","590180"," were wrong, but they are because a key moments from now into specifically January, there have been"
"590180","595000"," moments where Spock and reports are wrong and they claim well, we have real mint money selling"
"595000","600160"," coming in into the market, regardless of what options are saying. "
"600660","605460"," We're going to look at those times this morning because we'll look at the Spock and report for"
"605460","605720"," today."
"606480","608840"," It says that we're currently trading at 4400."
"609220","613500"," We remain in high volatility move with major indices adding more negative gamma. "
"613920","618600"," Before yesterday's open, we saw implied volatility deflating and signals related hedging feedback"
"618600","619260"," cycle flows."
"619260","623740"," Vanna negative gamma expiration induced induced charm would push markets higher."
"624480","630200"," This forecast was dashed by a combination of Ukraine headlines bullshit and Fed Talk bullshit,"
"630200","633800"," which have served to push the VIX futures structure to an inverted state. "
"634260","638740"," This suggests that the market is now more sensitive changes in blood volatility, which could result"
"638740","640020"," in faster market moves."
"640660","644880"," We're going to talk about real money selling this morning before the market opens, okay?"
"646300","652360"," And adding to this vol of vol stays expiration, where we measure roughly 25% of the gamma of S"
"652360","654560"," and P and Q is expiring blah, blah, blah, right?"
"654720","656440"," We got gamma expiring today."
"657960","661000"," We generally view this expression of puts to be the short term bullish event. "
"661180","666280"," However, this put heavy expiration is simply reducing a very large negative gamma to just large."
"666280","672740"," And we talked about how that we keep continue to see a role in the market to lower prices on"
"672740","675900"," put hedges out to March 18th and now May."
"676300","681460"," Now made down to 400, we see put hedges out to March 18th down to 420. "
"682260","685080"," We've traded as low as 435 at this point, right?"
"685980","688640"," And you heard stories come out saying, oh, it's just retail."
"688800","689200"," It's just retail."
"690040","692440"," You know, you should be long and bullish in this market, right?"
"693100","695500"," Maybe not the past couple days, but that's what we've been hearing, right?"
"695500","699200"," There's also a market, our Monday market holiday to throw into the mix. "
"699660","704500"," That will burn the theta unless some exogenous event takes place over the weekend."
"704960","709140"," If we trade down over the weekend, let's say 100 points, your fucking puts will print."
"709540","713400"," If we trade up 100 points into next Wednesday, your fucking calls will print. "
"713560","719040"," Otherwise, you should either be flattened cash in the clothes today, waiting for Tuesday, or you"
"719040","721360"," should be in some kind of a spread, right?"
"721680","722580"," Complex, simple."
"722580","723260"," I don't care."
"723560","730280"," You should not be holding anything into this weekend into Tuesday, regardless of which direction we"
"730280","731460"," move on Monday. "
"732020","734760"," Now, we do the view of the market's direction."
"734920","738340"," The geopolitical events is implied by the high implied volatility, negative gamma, but it's"
"738340","738760"," interest rate."
"739060","741400"," Sorry, creating the major angst amongst us, right?"
"742320","743960"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. "
"745400","747820"," Further linked to this choppy facts action is liquidity."
"747820","752980"," Shum below is the top of book liquidity in the futures, which has reduced sharply in 2022."
"753720","758240"," Okay, that means they have to create liquidity to move the market up, basically. "
"760520","766140"," Okay, so all of this is rather long-winded, suggested we'll say that we see markets position for"
"766140","768020"," continued weakness."
"768560","771840"," A break of four, three, four, five today implies a test of four, 20, 80."
"774640","775660"," This is a key part. "
"776060","777920"," Okay, and this was, I just read this for the first time this morning."
"777920","781280"," I already know all this shit, so this is the first time I read this this morning."
"782420","784760"," Okay, we treat any rally that occurs as a short cover. "
"785040","785980"," We talked about that."
"786160","791840"," I posted this on Twitter the other day, where we're thinking that a short covering rally is a"
"791840","794480"," rally, and it's not in the environment that we're in."
"794820","796260"," It's just short covering. "
"796940","797620"," It is not a rally."
"798300","801980"," We had posted this like a week ago, I think, four, five day or Monday, I believe I posted it."
"802580","805820"," And it's in the back of my mind the entire week, and it's just there, right?"
"805820","811000"," We see declines as a series of steps lower rather than a limit-down type event. "
"811040","815020"," As you can see below in our equity hub model, there's a sharp decrease in momentum indicator"
"815020","818700"," between current SBX levels of 444280."
"819200","823520"," This implies a fast price action from 430, 45 to 4280 support."
"824300","832000"," You may also note a large node near 4050, which points to significant options, positions, and"
"832000","834380"," support, ultimately around the 4,000 strike. "
"834380","837720"," Any of you that are here every single day, we talked about this like a week ago."
"837960","842480"," We talked about that positioning down to 400, extending into May."
"843580","844020"," Okay?"
"844360","848560"," So I want you to be conscious and aware of this that no matter where we trade and going back"
"848560","853880"," to the point where Spock Emma does a cover up and says, oh, real money selling, step in, right?"
"854180","855440"," We're going to look at that right now. "
"855900","859160"," So I want to show you here on the ES chart."
"859360","860560"," This is a six-month chart, right?"
"860560","864840"," And we know when things really started to get ugly was way back here in August."
"865420","867140"," We have this every month, right?"
"867340","867740"," Like clockwork. "
"867880","869180"," We're trading up, we're trading it up."
"869580","874280"," We trade down into this area here into September and October, right in here."
"874600","877780"," This is where the first problem really came into the scene, right?"
"878200","884300"," This is where we started to trade this up, and it failed, it failed, and we finally made it all "
"884300","885060","-time new highs. "
"885440","887840"," We started having some failure events in here, right?"
"887840","889660"," We're having these failure events."
"890040","891120"," We had it again here."
"891260","892160"," We had it again here. "
"892280","893120"," We had it again here."
"893660","899900"," You got one, two, you can mark these dates, go into Spock Emma, and you will see exactly when they"
"899900","904540"," say the same shit, which is we have real money selling that goes against what the hero indicator is"
"904540","904780"," saying."
"905420","911380"," The key behind this is that as we're coming up to these resistance points, we're not able to get"
"911380","912920"," out of this negative channel here. "
"913120","915740"," Even when we traded higher here, we weren't able to get out."
"915740","917900"," There's just another opportunity to short this market."
"918200","920680"," Now, Dan Niles, some of you guys like him hate him, I don't care. "
"921120","926320"," He let it slip last week where he said, any time we're in oversold conditions, we rebuy it, but"
"926320","931920"," then the moment that we're out of those oversold conditions, we're fucking short in the market."
"932440","933740"," And so he's not the only one to do it."
"933800","935380"," These are long-only type hedge funds. "
"935740","940700"," If they're doing it, then you've got just short funds that are always short, right?"
"940800","942700"," That's magnifying the selling in the market."
"942700","949980"," The underline, we already know those stocks have been sold, all the way going back to January of"
"949980","951340"," 2021."
"952140","954200"," So you've got all these stills underneath the house. "
"954620","958520"," You've got a vacation house sitting over on the beach somewhere, and you've got all these stills"
"958520","959820"," holding it up for a storm, right?"
"960320","964060"," And one by one, all these stocks have been knocked down over the course of a year."
"964460","968580"," And now you've got one, two, three, four, five, maybe 10 stocks holding the entire thing up."
"968580","974900"," And right now, they're knocking these stocks down one by one and bringing this house down to where"
"974900","975760"," the storm can hit it. "
"976240","977880"," And so we're seeing that repetitively."
"978080","982720"," We've seen it once, twice, three, four, and five times at this point."
"983180","986360"," So even if we trade this up here, it doesn't matter if we trade it up here today. "
"986840","989740"," It doesn't matter if we trade it up here next week or whatever."
"990000","990900"," At this point, right?"
"991280","992560"," You can't belong this market."
"993020","993920"," You just can't. "
"994300","995580"," I'm telling you, you can't."
"995580","1002640"," The structure down below, and the hedges against this market heading into heading into at least May"
"1002640","1003500"," currently, right?"
"1003840","1006840"," May have us going down to 400, 390."
"1007580","1010580"," Now, this might mean, hey, you listen to Captain Jim, he's saying we have to get super duper"
"1010580","1012580"," bullish right now because he's so bearish. "
"1012680","1016040"," I'm not really embarrassed in general below this line here."
"1016520","1018680"," I'll take bullish trades going up here."
"1019160","1022580"," But the reality is we get into this zone right here. "
"1022980","1024119"," The banks are shorting it."
"1024119","1027380"," And until they stop shorting it, that's the play, okay?"
"1027700","1030940"," The play is going to be as the future holds, right?"
"1031280","1033480"," That we short any rips higher at this point."
"1034040","1038140"," And you just stop listening to CNBC out there telling you we're hammering out of bottom. "
"1038700","1039640"," I bought the dip."
"1039859","1040400"," I bought Netflix."
"1040940","1043740"," And any of that shit that you hear out there, it's just fucking bullshit. "
"1044319","1046040"," And they're going to use any excuse they can."
"1046420","1050020"," It ain't going to matter if it's fucking fears on a war with Ukraine."
"1050380","1055760"," It's not going to matter if it's whatever fucking, you know, about FMC minutes or whatever. "
"1056180","1059940"," Just know that they're liquidating their positions in this market."
"1060360","1064080"," Know that real money selling means that people are dumping."
"1064820","1066280"," And it's like a game of musical chairs. "
"1066500","1072200"," At some point, you're going to be the last woman or man there sitting there holding that bag of"
"1072200","1072500"," shit."
"1073080","1074700"," And you won't recover from it."
"1075140","1076100"," It could take you a year. "
"1076180","1077480"," It could take you five years or 10 years."
"1077900","1080660"," You want to be out of there and you want to be buying the bottom when it comes."
"1081460","1083840"," When that bottom comes, I don't know right now. "
"1084180","1086760"," It could we could have one more bottom here coming into March and May."
"1087060","1089880"," We could have another bottom coming up into late fall."
"1090480","1095500"," And to be honest with you, at this point, looking back the past six months, you can't even get"
"1095500","1095820"," bullish. "
"1095820","1100160"," You can't even get bullish if we get up to if we trade all with the fuck up to 480,"
"1100400","1101060"," you can't get bullish."
"1101880","1102760"," You can't."
"1103140","1107780"," We can trade this up to 480, but you're not you're not getting back on this track that we were"
"1107780","1109600"," on the last two years. "
"1109600","1114080"," Even if you were to get on a track that is something like, let's just say it's like this."
"1114600","1118560"," Just just for fuck's sake, we say it's like this, let's say, right?"
"1119080","1121240"," Let's say we're just trading on this track for this point forward."
"1121620","1122740"," You can't get bullish here. "
"1123040","1125340"," You can't get bullish until we trade down much lower."
"1125680","1130860"," You can then pick that bottom to take long to a price point and then you're going to have to"
"1130860","1131080"," sell."
"1131780","1132820"," And you have no business. "
"1133700","1136960"," Honestly, you have no business being long in this market as it is right now."
"1137020","1137480"," None of us do."
"1137480","1140000"," None of us have any business buying stock down here. "
"1140220","1141340"," We have no business."
"1141580","1146480"," And if anything, if you're a long bull, you have to wait at this point at the worst."
"1147000","1149140"," You have to wait until we we find. "
"1149920","1153580"," We find some sort of a form of a channel that we're trading in."
"1153660","1156260"," And currently for the past six months, that has not happened."
"1156640","1157800"," It has not proved itself. "
"1159000","1162320"," This seldom proved it two days ago on Wednesday and Thursday."
"1162900","1165100"," This morning, Ukraine is a fuck show this morning."
"1165100","1168540"," And you see no selling off before this bell this morning. "
"1168780","1170540"," That doesn't mean we don't sell off the bell this morning."
"1170760","1172400"," But the key being is this."
"1172560","1178320"," This has nothing to do with the news, has everything to do with the de-risking of large banks and"
"1178320","1178860"," institutions. "
"1179700","1183580"," And then hedge funds amplifying the selling at key pivots, right?"
"1183960","1186240"," These are, these are, this isn't rocket science up here."
"1186340","1188140"," They're showing it to us clear as day."
"1188260","1189580"," It doesn't even matter if we trade higher. "
"1190060","1193720"," We're going to look for major, even if we trade above this negative channel, we're going to look"
"1193720","1198760"," for major resistances all along the way until we stop this market."
"1198920","1199620"," I guarantee it."
"1199860","1200500"," That's what we're doing. "
"1200660","1202500"," We're going to drain this market down the drain."
"1203040","1203700"," And that's fine."
"1203840","1204900"," I actually like that because I'm a bull. "
"1205020","1206000"," I want to buy bottoms."
"1206260","1207500"," I want to buy a big ass bottom."
"1207960","1210100"," And eventually that's going to take place down here. "
"1211160","1212100"," Does that make sense?"
"1212600","1214240"," Does everybody following me out there on this?"
"1216100","1217500"," Now for today, okay?"
"1218400","1220400"," It's 9.24. We've got a few more minutes."
"1220980","1225000"," You've got some support down here that you know about right where we are right now, right?"
"1225140","1225440"," 436."
"1226040","1227360"," The real support this morning. "
"1227620","1230860"," I haven't opened up a, we'll open up a book map here in just a minute."
"1230980","1233120"," But real support is down here at 435."
"1234580","1238740"," Possibly get a little bit more support somewhere down here around 431, 432. "
"1239600","1242720"," And then your next tag down below here is 426."
"1243540","1247180"," And where the banks are right now, they're down here at 420."
"1247640","1249040"," They're way down here at 420. "
"1249040","1249920"," That's where they are."
"1250120","1251320"," Do I think they get it right now?"
"1251640","1252340"," Probably not."
"1252600","1254140"," Probably not getting 420 today. "
"1254600","1256620"," Do I think they're getting 420 by March 18th?"
"1256740","1257140"," More than likely."
"1257500","1261720"," It's like a 70% chance they're getting 420 between now and March 18th."
"1262000","1263720"," Do I think they're getting 400 by May?"
"1264200","1267000"," Yeah, I think they're getting 420 or 400 by May. "
"1267280","1268760"," Right now they're positioned for it."
"1269120","1272500"," And until we see some kind of major Vanirale."
"1272760","1274200"," You guys remember the old Vanirales?"
"1274520","1278180"," You get the short covering squeeze and then you get a cascade waterfall. "
"1278940","1281580"," Of calls that were way outside of where we were trading."
"1281640","1282940"," We'd be trading at 480."
"1284520","1286980"," You'd see 500 calls for 500, 520. "
"1287500","1289940"," And until we see that shit, situation is sell."
"1290460","1291020"," That's what it is."
"1291360","1292200"," Even if we trade up today. "
"1292360","1293400"," It doesn't matter if we trade up today."
"1294300","1296460"," Just be conscious of that as we move forward."
"1296880","1299260"," And then I'm going to put up the, what am I going to put up here?"
"1299900","1301180"," I'm going to turn that off right here. "
"1302160","1303960"," But I want you to keep this on your calendar."
"1304280","1304340"," Okay."
"1304460","1306580"," Every time we trade up here, we're looking to go short. "
"1306580","1307840"," Heavy, heavy, short."
"1308320","1310080"," Every time we're up here, I don't care how high we trade."
"1310080","1311040"," We trade this eye right here. "
"1311380","1314700"," Hopefully some of you guys on Wednesday bought some put spreads at that 450."
"1314800","1318360"," We talked about putting some put spreads on for yesterday's downfall."
"1319160","1320480"," So we're going to get rid of this right here. "
"1320640","1323860"," And we're going to turn on the book map for the open."
"1323860","1326800"," And then I'll look at your comments and you're in the chat box and see you guys have to say."
"1328100","1330800"," Sorry to throw a pile of shit on you. "
"1331020","1333180"," That doesn't mean that you buy puts right on the bell here either."
"1333180","1337220"," All that means is that we're in a cell environment."
"1337860","1341220"," That's what we're in no matter if we're hammering at a bottom or not. "
"1341520","1344980"," And in all honesty, they're only longing when we're oversold."
"1345180","1345900"," We're oversold."
"1346160","1350560"," They'll buy it or you've got shorts just covering to get cheap puts, cheap shorts again. "
"1351100","1353040"," And then they're taking it short once again."
"1358440","1359940"," I go long on big bottoms."
"1364360","1365340"," All right, all that here. "
"1365660","1367400"," It was crazy."
"1367720","1372100"," So on Wednesday, I went and took my daughter for a third vaccination shot."
"1372220","1375120"," And then I took a flu shot. "
"1375420","1377880"," This late in the season, I was like, hey, you never had your flu shot?"
"1377900","1378400"," I want to have one."
"1378780","1380080"," And I got sick from that yesterday."
"1380080","1382120"," And then I had to do dental dentist stuff. "
"1382640","1388600"," And then today I'm going to end up having to get off the broadcast and leave you guys alone at"
"1388600","1389120"," some point."

"2736870","2738410"," See, there's any calls out there. "
"2768450","2773750"," Calls on puts on NQ, not a big bid."
"2774550","2779910"," February 18th, 343 P for $87,000 seems like that trade is over to me."
"2780050","2780890"," I could be wrong on that. "
"2781470","2791210"," Facebook calls February 18th to 10 C, $83,000 Starbucks, March 18th, 95 C for $203 "
"2791210","2794830",",000 Nike calls March 18th."
"2796910","2800330"," 150 C for $230,000."
"2800330","2804050"," Looks like a bid's coming into the market for this month, right?"
"2804630","2811670"," So for OPEC's for this month, we've got OPEC's for next month, you'll see some banks going along so"
"2811670","2820990"," we can trade that movement, trade higher for the month of March and then trade lower into the end"
"2820990","2823490"," of March's OPEC's with all the doom and gloom. "
"2832090","2836730"," So if we look for the month of March, trading area for month of March will be the expectations,"
"2837690","2842470"," give me what you think that the range will be for the month of March."
"2842470","2847470"," We know that in March 18, we've got our excuse me, I don't know if it's 18, but I'm March,"
"2847670","2852190"," right around that time period, we've got the FOMC where we should have rates be announced."
"2853050","2858950"," We know that in the FOMC minutes that that was used as a reason to sell the market, I would"
"2858950","2864730"," anticipate that even though we know we're getting a rate hike on the next FOMC meeting in March"
"2864730","2870850"," that you'll find volatility and selling pressure, even though we know what's coming in an end of"
"2870850","2871110"," March. "
"2871110","2877670"," So let me know in the chat or talk amongst yourselves what you think the trading ranges for March."
"2877670","2883930"," I think it's, I think that the out of the bounds high is probably 460."
"2885270","2891950"," The range is probably 460 max, maybe one day we hit 460 or 450. "
"2893090","2896250"," I think we trade though, generally in this month."
"2897130","2898570"," Let's take a look for this entire month."
"2898730","2900350"," We know the range for. "
"2901430","2902530"," Time to look in."
"2903190","2905630"," Jen, let's look at February, I guess, right?"
"2906130","2909630"," February one, our trading range for February was."
"2911010","2912110"," To the first. "
"2915060","2920240"," We were at 447 and we're trading at 437 right now."
"2921580","2925300"," We traded one deviation outside of that, so."
"2926780","2931180"," Wouldn't surprise us me to see us trade 450 to 420. "
"2933160","2934740"," Or maybe 450 to 430."
"2935460","2936740"," Let me look marked out of my."
"2937880","2940040"," Wouldn't surprise me to see us trade 450. "
"2941240","2943160"," I'm going to change this real quick."
"2946360","2948460"," So let's call it 430."
"2953550","2954490"," Or March. "
"2959630","2965050"," That's what I'm going to expect for 430 to 450 trading range for March and then."
"2967450","2969490"," Possibly at a high we might get to 460."
"2970210","2972830"," If there was some kind of good news, but I'm going to doubt it. "
"2972930","2979290"," I'm going to say that our upper range for March is 450 being generous and then."
"2979970","2985810"," Our lower range would be 430 and then, of course, any volatility into."
"2987210","2993690"," Opex is going to send us down to 420 and we'll keep 400 on the radar heading into May. "
"2996110","2997790"," That's what I'm thinking for the month of March."
"3000490","3002850"," We've got spy calls coming in."
"3003850","3010130"," 39 March 9, 431 C for $698,000. "
"3010450","3016430"," Tesla calls February 25, 900 C, $464,000."
"3017150","3022650"," We've got Apple calls March 18, 170 C for $926,000."
"3023750","3027770"," Apple calls February 18, 170 C for $44,000. "
"3030220","3033500"," So yeah, that kind of fits the mold, right?"
"3034120","3037280"," It kind of fits the mold for the month."
"3038020","3043660"," We could trade to 450 buy in the money calls for the month, but those print and then trade it"
"3043660","3045400"," back down again for."
"3046420","3047800"," For March, Opex. "
"3048300","3054060"," So maybe we trade up to 450 heading into early March and then we did possible 460."
"3054760","3056360"," But I'm going to I'm going to tag it at 450."
"3060190","3063870"," I'm going to tag it at 450 for the month of March so you get some in the money calls. "
"3064090","3066830"," This is actually a perfect day to buy some spreads."
"3068350","3072510"," Far out spreads where you could buy spreads at 450 and then some spreads at 430."
"3074350","3076050"," And see if they both print. "
"3076450","3078570"," I will assume that they both print at some point."
"3085140","3087440"," Some month calls and puts."
"3089020","3090540"," Yeah, upper price target 450. "
"3091420","3094420"," Maybe we trade to 460 over the course of a day to three days."
"3096000","3097560"," I think that's being generous."
"3098100","3105740"," And then I think that heading into March 18, we start price or price targeting lower. "
"3105980","3106580"," Positive territory."
"3108520","3109700"," Do you see him?"
"3111300","3113200"," Says we're in positive territory."
"3141840","3144300"," Giving it a nice short covering rally here. "
"3148630","3151030"," Have some sellers above at 439."
"3159150","3171170"," 438.75. You guys"
"3171170","3171710"," saying here?"
"3188080","3192620"," Yeah, I'd be looking at any kind of rally here just as a short covering rally."
"3194500","3200120"," And I would expect to see a bid come into in the money calls heading to for the month at"
"3200120","3202940"," least of March, which would lift the market up as well. "
"3203560","3208380"," And then we could trade to 450 into the first couple of weeks of March."
"3208380","3213960"," But we'd be looking for some form of a rejection heading down into 420."
"3213960","3217840"," We the price target for March expiration and then 400. "
"3218380","3218940"," 400."
"3219200","3221980"," We the price target from May expiration currently."
"3248080","3249920"," Just keep your eyes on this up here. "
"3252120","3253240"," 438 88."
"3256520","3260040"," Slightly lower sellers coming down, probably some some hidden nice here."
"3260040","3261920"," 438 84. "
"3272360","3274280"," See if we can break above or not."
"3274860","3279660"," But a minute to our data to see home sales for January and the US expected 6.1 million."

"3574910","3578050"," That's four sets of sweeps against BAC. "
"3578930","3580770"," Now five sets against BAC."
"3581350","3586590"," Four sets against BSBC scratch that someone's buying the dip on heart K."
"3586590","3590950"," After that Kathy Woods bullshit yesterday, February 25, 67 C."
"3591610","3592970"," $152,000."
"3593450","3594870"," You guys should look at that. "
"3595130","3597470"," She had that same same story last."
"3598310","3600270"," She had that same story last January too."
"3600690","3603170"," That actually the same script she used last January. "
"3603930","3604990"," Exact same script."
"3607670","3610870"," And I was looking at real estate yesterday."
"3611910","3615650"," I was shocked at the number of unfinished rehabs. "
"3616400","3618050"," That we're trying to be sold."
"3618590","3621630"," Just just people out there posting ads saying."
"3622530","3625770"," You know, three quarters is laid down with this rehab. "
"3625770","3627710"," You guys want to buy it for a cash offer."
"3628470","3630170"," I'll take 80 grand, 100 grand."
"3631070","3631870"," Whatever it may be. "
"3633910","3637850"," I saw some lower rents on newly rehabs properties yesterday too."
"3638190","3641110"," Lower than expected or than I expected to see."
"3641110","3644610"," So it looks like people are trying to get tenants into housing right now. "
"3645930","3650050"," Better rental rates, which was kind of a head scratcher."
"3650750","3652150"," I saw that yesterday."
"3655450","3662910"," But the housing inventory is lower than anticipated on the expectation of higher rates into March. "
"3663370","3665310"," I was talking about this on Friday."
"3665870","3666450"," You know, it's weird."
"3666630","3668570"," You got 30% of these people are new home buyers. "
"3669170","3676350"," And I don't think that everyone understands what happens in these situations, right?"
"3676630","3682070"," The thought process is you got a realtor in your ear saying you got to lock in those rates right"
"3682070","3682470"," now."
"3683230","3685010"," And everybody focuses on that."
"3685130","3687970"," They're always like, I do a real by the way, I do a lot of real estate. "
"3688710","3694290"," So people are like, hey, those realtors specifically are like, you lock that rate in right now"
"3694290","3695290"," before rates go up."
"3695290","3701470"," And what they don't tell you is that your home price in your neighborhood might shit the bed."
"3702730","3710250"," And even if rates don't go up and you get locked in paying a mortgage payment that is significantly"
"3710250","3716550"," higher than the guy that waits or the woman that waits until prices come down on homes. "
"3716990","3720670"," And then, of course, the realtor tells you they're never coming down, but that's bullshit."
"3721630","3725970"," When rates go up, home prices come down, believe it or not."
"3727110","3729130"," So you're getting stuck in a mortgage payment. "
"3730290","3732470"," You're paying for a house that's, you know, no less."
"3732750","3736150"," Well, right now they're saying 15% on average across the country."
"3736610","3740630"," I'm assuming that that number is even stupider in other markets, right?"
"3740910","3743950"," I'm sure it's up 30, 50% playing on the market. "
"3743950","3751610"," In my market where I live, home prices have, in the past two years, have tripled."
"3752670","3754390"," But home prices here used to be dirt cheap."
"3755490","3757570"," But then a lot of homes here have doubled, tripled. "
"3758970","3759830"," At least the rehabs."
"3759910","3762150"," You could buy rehabs there two years ago."
"3762450","3765310"," Well, I guess three to four years ago, you get them dirt cheap. "
"3766150","3767010"," They went up the path."
"3767310","3773030"," Just before COVID, they were going up, but now you can't find a rehab."
"3773610","3776890"," Or less than four times what they were going for. "
"3779070","3782670"," At any price point, nice neighborhoods, nice suburbs, doesn't matter."
"3783570","3785870"," They've got to ridiculous amounts of money."
"3790710","3792490"," Ooh, I haven't watched South Park in a long time. "
"3792610","3793210"," I'll look that up."
"3793870","3795150"," I would like to get back into it."
"3798540","3798820"," Yeah. "
"3804480","3805580"," I mean, I'm missing some of this."
"3810520","3811760"," The real estate is fucked."
"3821930","3826090"," I was a question after over a year of comparison for housing market kind of. "
"3827550","3828030"," Moot."
"3828250","3832730"," No, they can't be because they can't be because I own real estate right now."
"3832730","3834110"," I'm trying to sell my real estate. "
"3834430","3840930"," So the point being that I have real estate that I purchased pre pandemic."
"3841510","3843210"," That I'm trying to get rid of right now."
"3843310","3844970"," I'm trying to unload it on you. "
"3845690","3851610"," Right now as rates go up and the in the pandemic subsides."
"3852250","3855130"," So there'll be a glut of people trying to sell these homes."
"3856430","3857630"," Does that make sense?"
"3858650","3859830"," There'll be a glut. "
"3861210","3866530"," As the as the coronavirus subsides, you'll see more housing stock available."
"3866810","3869530"," And you'll also see rates increasing."
"3870030","3872650"," So when you see the housing stock increasing. "
"3874150","3874590"," Right?"
"3874770","3879390"," You've got people that want to sell and we've got even just normal people that want to sell."
"3879610","3881810"," So let's say I don't let's say I don't want to sell right now."
"3882370","3885670"," I don't want to sell and I'm holding a house here. "
"3885830","3885970"," Right?"
"3886210","3891090"," So I own my house here and I don't want to sell and rates start to begin to go up."
"3891330","3891770"," Right?"
"3892270","3899450"," So we have less people able to secure mortgages or wanting to secure mortgages."
"3899450","3908110"," And then we have a glut from from the pandemic subsiding supposedly people that want to sell. "
"3908450","3908570"," Right?"
"3908810","3910910"," And then you have too many homes out there."
"3912190","3913090"," Absolutely not."
"3913470","3914050"," Trust me. "
"3916190","3918050"," You can buy my house if you want to."
"3920850","3922310"," Real estate's not going up."
"3922750","3923910"," Another 300%. "
"3925430","3926710"," They can promise you that."
"3927970","3928830"," It's no bubble."
"3929110","3931890"," It's no bubble amongst the people behind the scenes. "
"3933150","3940770"," There's no secrets behind the walls of the real estate developers and realtors."
"3941510","3943610"," They all kind of know what's going on behind the scenes."
"3944890","3946390"," They're not going to tell you as a buyer. "
"3946990","3948470"," I'm not going to tell you that as a buyer."
"3949230","3950150"," They're not going to tell you."
"3951190","3956130"," Rates are going up on houses and there'll be a glut of houses before you know it. "
"3957910","3959870"," I'm not going to tell you that if you're trying to buy my house."
"3959890","3961830"," I'm going to tell you markets only going up."
"3962850","3967630"," But I'll tell you guys that as a homeowner, we're trying to sell. "
"3968910","3971550"," You know, this is our our plan is to sell right now."
"3975280","3975680"," Absolutely."
"3977060","3978000"," Buy my houses. "
"3982160","3982560"," Cudel."
"3983040","3983840"," Hundred bucks."
"3993450","3994810"," It's time to unload your houses. "
"3995070","3995370"," Trust me."
"3995370","4001530"," I remember I was I was an adult in 2007 2008."
"4001990","4003110"," I was an adult. "
"4003390","4004670"," I saw it happen last time."
"4005270","4006350"," First hand experience."
"4007450","4008590"," Watch it happen. "
"4014650","4016090"," Watch it happen."
"4016350","4017510"," Watch it happen then too."
"4021750","4026190"," So yeah, it's obscene like a US Treasury curve flattening today. "
"4026190","4031470"," 46 or less basis points now on the 210 spread as rates at the long end continue to drift lower."
"4032190","4032750"," All the two year."
"4033510","4035050"," It's starting to roll over slightly. "
"4037930","4039250"," See where the by the dippers are at."
"4040310","4041430"," Four thirty five still."
"4042070","4042570"," Same place. "
"4043310","4045190"," Take a peek here and see if there's anything else we don't see."
"4056080","4056500"," Yeah."
"4056640","4056720"," No. "
"4056980","4059300"," My plan is to."
"4066830","4068430"," Yeah, they don't understand that."
"4069210","4070070"," They will though. "
"4071510","4072850"," They will understand it."
"4074150","4074810"," They will."
"4076670","4084330"," Anyone that was an adult in the mid 2000s, early 2000s knows exactly what happened. "
"4084730","4088750"," People just screamed at you in the face and told you there wasn't going to happen, but it did."
"4089610","4091770"," It wasn't just and it wasn't just the rates."
"4092030","4092830"," Everybody talks about that. "
"4093150","4094230"," It's always fucking realtors."
"4094430","4097170"," Always fucking realtors telling you luck and go luck in that rate."
"4097170","4100170"," And the reality is it's not luck in their rate. "
"4100170","4104870"," It's that your neighbor's houses lose value and then you're locked in."
"4105510","4110149"," It's not just people and variable rates that that walk away from their houses."
"4110149","4113930"," It's definitely people with a mortgage that's unattainable. "
"4114109","4115029"," It's not just that."
"4115210","4115990"," You've got other problems."
"4116130","4119130"," You've got cost of goods going up, cost of services going up. "
"4119870","4122590"," Then you have a high price that you paid for a house."
"4123250","4130490"," Even if your rates aren't there and then you have you have work, right?"
"4130649","4136830"," Go dries up and you don't have when you've got a tightening of the economy, right?"
"4137210","4138890"," You don't have an expansion of the economy."
"4139870","4141189"," Then jobs dry up. "
"4141910","4150810"," You have companies that shareholders are going to demand that they remain profitable."
"4152569","4157010"," So if a company says in their, specifically this ER season."
"4158550","4161109"," We see us being profitable this year. "
"4161550","4166390"," I can assure you that the guys in the background, the women in the background, whoever it is, when"
"4166390","4169250"," the background or the accounts in the background are saying, don't worry, boss."
"4169950","4175470"," We can get at least another three quarters in case inflation goes down and the economy picks back"
"4175470","4179770"," up of profits and how we'll do it is we'll just cut."
"4180430","4180830"," Right?"
"4180970","4183090"," We'll cut employees, right?"
"4183350","4185430"," And this will tide us over for the next three quarters. "
"4186149","4189130"," And then if the market shifts the bed, who cares at that point, right?"
"4189250","4190290"," We've done our part as a company."
"4190850","4192310"," And so they start to lay people off."
"4193029","4199730"," They'd start to not expand and new expansion and development of products, right?"
"4200050","4202130"," We're not going to launch this project and hold on that. "
"4202550","4205830"," Then we're going to start to lay some people off and then you get like two, three good quarters out"
"4205830","4206310"," of that company."
"4206910","4208670"," Stockholders are happy, shareholders are happy."
"4209190","4213710"," And then of course if the economy doesn't come back, that would be that one to three year mark. "
"4214050","4216810"," You start to see a rollover in these companies, right?"
"4217790","4219830"," You see the tightening of our economy."
"4220550","4223190"," That doesn't mean that shares won't be up."
"4223530","4227710"," You got to think of this from Joe and Jill Main Street. "
"4228010","4229090"," We don't think of it from their perspective."
"4229990","4231370"," So you want to get a new job."
"4232190","4233810"," You might be stuck in your job. "
"4233830","4235470"," You might get stuck with wage inflation."
"4235470","4239530"," Even if wages have gone up, you're not going to see higher wages."
"4240550","4244890"," And then you'll start to see your neighbor's house, you know, become cheaper. "
"4245510","4248590"," And it becomes less or worth less than what your house is worth."
"4248990","4250270"," And then you try to go sell it."
"4250370","4251610"," You're like, oh shit, I'm upside down. "
"4251890","4253130"," Just like buying a car in a way, right?"
"4253850","4254610"," Well, in a way."
"4256030","4260910"," Waller saying longer expansions improve job market for black workers, not commenting specifically"
"4260910","4261990"," on monetary policy."
"4262470","4267030"," Waller saying you believe running the economy hot does improve the job market for various groups. "
"4267650","4267950"," Absolutely."
"4268810","4269750"," I 100% agree with that."
"4270730","4271850"," That's that same point. "
"4272870","4274170"," That's on that same point."
"4274370","4279130"," If you, if they're going to tighten, it'll restrict the expansion of companies."
"4279890","4285790"," And so if we see rate hikes, if we see a QT, any of those things, you will have been"
"4285790","4288730"," locked into a house with cheaper prices at some point. "
"4291150","4293330"," That's on the exact same topic I'm talking about."
"4301070","4303650"," How much from the bank of the pans?"
"4304130","4309370"," Shimizu coming out of the G20 saying the G20 shared the need to be mindful of spill of effects of"
"4309370","4312970"," tightening monetary policy due to inflation in advanced economies."
"4314010","4315630"," How much from the bank of Japan's?"
"4315970","4316250"," Shimizu. "
"4317170","4317890"," All right."
"4318030","4318270"," Watching."
"4318810","4319450"," Let's see here. "
"4322210","4325490"," Tesla puts February 25th 850 P."
"4326790","4329730"," $780,000 snap calls."
"4330890","4336390"," May 20th 45 C 1.4 million dollars."
"4337930","4338870"," Spy puts. "
"4340210","4342430"," I think I tell you about those already are now."
"4342890","4345410"," See if that's the second set of spy puts that have come in."
"4347640","4349560"," Can't tell if that was the second set. "
"4349840","4350440"," The first set."
"4351360","4352280"," Just here."
"4352620","4353260"," It looks somewhere else. "
"4359630","4360170"," Yeah."
"4360930","4363190"," So just heads up out there."
"4363510","4366390"," There are two sets of spy puts. "
"4367190","4368830"," Both for $2 million."

"4380820","4381600"," Spy. "
"4387520","4388600"," Nasty."
"4390100","4393520"," Just nasty $4 million against the spy."
"4393520","4397580"," Depending on the spy going to 390 in May. "
"4401290","4401910"," MDT."
"4402750","4405130"," February 25th 102 P."
"4405750","4406430"," $800,000."
"4409350","4412250"," I think the recommendation would be if we ever get back to 450. "
"4413290","4417690"," You could probably put some nice in the money put spreads expiring in March and May."
"4418730","4421890"," As protection this market even if we do trade higher."
"4424730","4429170"," U.P.S.T. June 17th 105 P."
"4429630","4430730"," $800,000. "
"4442600","4444020"," Cudel's starting to pull back now."
"4444580","4445900"," You guys want to look at Cudel real quick?"
"4459060","4460220"," We'll let up Cudel."
"4464100","4465660"," That's not really a volatile day. "
"4465820","4470900"," It's a day when the last week but specifically today and next week."
"4471640","4474480"," In the end next week you'll probably see it into Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"4474480","4478580"," You'll see large bets being made that we trade higher. "
"4478820","4484380"," You'll see lots of spreads out there for our trading range for the month."
"4485060","4493400"," You'll see bets at a higher move and bets on a lower move for the month."
"4493900","4495120"," It being today being OPEC's. "
"4499700","4502780"," You'll see it from today into the 31st."
"4515940","4538780"," This is $4.35, $4.43, $4.25. We'll"
"4538780","4541440"," look up shop next here."
"4548890","4550590"," See what we see on Cudel. "

"4653700","4658460"," Price target on Cudel 93, 84, 45 or so."
"4658600","4660480"," You might see a rough patch down in here. "
"4667720","4668840"," Good night support."
"4670620","4671620"," Even lower."
"4673000","4674820"," I feel like the buy of the dippers want it. "
"4675160","4677460"," $85 be another price target down below."
"4679040","4681000"," Looks like the buyers came up from 90."
"4688340","4691760"," Your inputs just look at 94.95 and see if there's a bounce. "
"4699150","4705790"," Just incrementally here on the situation in Eastern Europe, a senior U official saying that the"

"5466760","5469060"," See if you can look lower and see if trades lower."
"5471280","5472660"," I don't see any buyers below. "
"5473260","5475820"," Same place right they were at ten bucks."
"5478400","5482480"," Looks like we're burning through some of the we have more sellers than buyers right now."
"5483060","5488160"," Looks like we're grinding through support might be able to take a take a take a put here but it's"
"5488160","5489740"," only for another seventy five cents. "
"5490900","5493180"," They can have some firm support down at ten bucks."
"5494140","5495060"," We get forward next."
"5509210","5512250"," See if there's a bounce here on spy. "
"5513030","5513970"," They can trade higher."
"5515030","5518070"," It reminds you of yesterday right we've trade sideways."
"5518810","5521130"," Up down up down up down then we find a direction. "
"5521770","5525210"," I think the same thing happened on Wednesday as well."
"5527540","5528680"," No liquidity in the market."
"5529160","5534160"," Think about I want you guys to look at the spy currently right today. "
"5534560","5537780"," Look at the spy today and think to yourself."
"5538440","5543420"," If there is short covering in the market right now say shorts are going to cover."
"5543860","5546000"," They probably would have covered right on the bell. "
"5547500","5548880"," Right there said fuck it."
"5548880","5550340"," We were taking a take our money and run."
"5552060","5557740"," And then you would also see a bunch of news articles out there just you know this is the bottom"
"5557740","5558500"," we're going higher. "
"5560220","5564640"," And you would see you know all these guys I don't know if they're on CNBC what they're saying right"
"5564640","5565160"," now but."
"5566000","5569440"," You'd see a bunch of guys saying oh we bought the dip because they want you to buy the dip"
"5569440","5570480"," to run it back up."
"5571040","5573300"," And you would see a short covering rally. "
"5574120","5582400"," And you would also see a event rally from institutional buyers and retail buyers you would see that"
"5582400","5583600"," fuel right."
"5584360","5587160"," Drive the market to crazy all-time highs."
"5587720","5589440"," Actually Ford looks pretty good here. "
"5589700","5590240"," I like Ford here."
"5591040","5592120"," Buyers down at 17 bucks."
"5593940","5595760"," Technically at least Ford looks great here. "
"5597300","5597740"," 1750."
"5598900","5601580"," Some seller or some sellers above at 1839."
"5602120","5603640"," So I like this ticker right now. "
"5604500","5605060"," Like a lie."
"5606980","5607580"," Look below."
"5607960","5608800"," This is a nice setup. "
"5611440","5614220"," Best place to buy at 17 bucks unless market conditions change."
"5615440","5617000"," That's a good good place to buy Ford."
"5619340","5619780"," Nice. "
"5620300","5623840"," I like seeing tickers look like this versus a wall of sellers above."
"5629940","5632360"," I like seeing a wall of buyers below a ticker."
"5635900","5636920"," Unless there's a rug bull. "
"5637720","5638580"," Which is always possible."
"5643200","5646480"," So what you end up seeing when you see a event rally what you end up seeing is you end"
"5646480","5646740"," up seeing."
"5647820","5649560"," You end up seeing like the spy specifically. "
"5649800","5653960"," You see the spy just it would just go slowly up up up up up up up."
"5654140","5655120"," It just doesn't stop."
"5655500","5655940"," It's relentless. "
"5655940","5660680"," And matter of fact if you're ever in a event rally typically and you're scared to buy it."
"5661180","5663340"," And you just keep you're like just waiting for the next good price."
"5664260","5668060"," That's when you know you're in a event rally when you never get the next good price. "
"5668500","5671100"," It just goes from level to level to level trade sideways."
"5671600","5674180"," Goes to level to level at least one, two, three in a day."
"5674600","5675640"," Two or three levels in a day. "
"5676600","5680040"," Two or three resistance zones right you'll go up to resistance zone."
"5680380","5682460"," Sit on it trade sideways for like five, ten minutes."
"5682460","5686860"," Trade to the next one sideways five, ten minutes then to the next one. "
"5687000","5688720"," So you're looking for all that fuel on the fire."
"5689400","5692560"," On top of short covering forest move higher."
"5692720","5694380"," So just let's look at spy today. "
"5695440","5696800"," Just like what happened yesterday."
"5697500","5699000"," And you're not seeing that right."
"5699540","5700740"," You're seeing day traders in here. "
"5700800","5702080"," They're buying the dip selling the rip."
"5702300","5705840"," You're not seeing major short covering right now at this moment."
"5706280","5709140"," You'd see a straight melt up if you saw major short covering. "
"5709620","5714380"," We're not seeing that presenting itself at this moment in the market on a Friday."
"5714420","5715640"," Heading into a long weekend."
"5716840","5719440"," So you got theta burn coming in if you're going to be a long trader. "
"5720900","5723440"," This just looks like we're waiting for another sell."
"5724220","5724920"," That's what it looks like."
"5727560","5730660"," Just be aware of that as we continue to trade the rest of the day ahead. "
"5736460","5738120"," Real blocks on all time low is it really?"
"5739780","5741920"," When does the windows of an early start?"
"5742500","5743180"," You can usually tell."
"5743420","5744640"," It's fairly easy to."
"5745680","5746160"," It's fair. "
"5746220","5751580"," As for Feds Evans now saying it's still seeing inflation mainly due to factors that will correct."
"5752280","5759320"," Policies wrong-footed needs substantial adjustments as Evans may need a less policy restraint now."
"5760100","5760520"," Versus patent. "
"5761520","5764180"," But it's more persistent technological disruption."
"5765080","5773980"," Would for tighter policies as Evans's inflation pressures have clearly widened in the"
"5773980","5775920"," economy."
"5776200","5781100"," This must ensure inflation does not feed into underlying trends. "
"5784020","5789900"," By now testing 43557 from pre-market lows."
"5792380","5798010"," The pre-market low was 43563."
"5801760","5821770"," Looking for buyers at 435.05. Now"
"5821770","5822950"," just careful out there guys. "

"5827250","5829070"," Palantir puts ten keys."
"5829070","5833650"," As far as you've heard from Feds Evans now we're also looking for comments from Feds Williams"
"5833650","5835670"," around the top of the hour. "
"5835670","5839470"," This afternoon we could hear from Feds Brainerd."
"5841410","5844810"," Palantir puts June 17th ten P."
"5845070","5846370"," Looks like they want to pin it at ten."
"5847290","5849530"," I wouldn't be buying fucking calls on Palantir. "
"5849650","5850910"," You're buying like stonks."
"5851550","5854010"," Other than that don't fuck around yet."
"5855330","5858150"," 617 ten P for $150,000. "
"5858510","5860810"," Palantir that's probably a hedge fund too."
"5860810","5865510"," Not even a retail investor."
"5865770","5869050"," Probably somebody trying to pin that stock trying to get some capitulation to lower numbers. "
"5869890","5871770"," Palantir January 20th ten P."
"5871950","5872990"," $245,000."

"5878690","5881090"," Palantir March 18th ten P."
"5881290","5882310"," $48,000. "
"5883150","5884430"," NVIDIA puts coming through."
"5884750","5887290"," Calls on forward March 18th nineteen C."
"5887830","5888810"," $83,000."
"5889730","5891230"," I just own the fucking stock. "
"5891510","5892330"," I just own Ford."
"5893270","5897150"," Remember when they used to give Ford away for like three bucks on Robinhood years ago, right?"
"5897410","5898670"," I think it was like three years ago or something."
"5898810","5902390"," They'd give Ford stock away for like three dollars. "
"5903310","5906050"," Ford March 18th nineteen C."
"5906490","5907410"," $1,000,000."
"5910700","5912540"," Looking for a nice bounce here."
"5913160","5917340"," I'm going to read what Feds Evans said to you if he's got it in here and we'll see if"
"5917340","5918180"," they can read this to you. "
"5922970","5924290"," Feds Evans, right?"
"5924470","5925090"," He's a dove."
"5925670","5926690"," He's not a voter though."
"5927130","5930870"," He may need less policy restraint now versus past episodes. "
"5932270","5935910"," Less policy restraint in past episodes."
"5936150","5939910"," Substantial repositioning of policy could be done with low risk to jobs."
"5940990","5942890"," Current policy is wrong footed. "
"5943250","5948830"," Still sees inflation mainly due to factors that will correct underlying inflation as well anchored"
"5948830","5957110"," at a level that will gain more evidence on inflation sources and can adjust policy accordingly."
"5958170","5960690"," Basically, they're saying we want to run it hot, right?"
"5960830","5961330"," That's what he's saying."
"5961410","5962490"," Let's keep running it hot. "
"5963610","5967850"," Because if we showed out of India, the trade secretary saying they will start receiving"

"6401410","6402570"," It's a good question."
"6403410","6407510"," Is the U.S. waiting for a false flag or was the government just predicting one by Russia?"
"6408450","6416310"," Looks like Russia is pulling some false flag type stuff right now, or at least trying to muddy the"
"6416310","6417210"," waters on."
"6417210","6418750"," What's happening right now over there?"

"6432350","6437930"," Bark and Khmerar, whoever that is, you'll start to see these guys come out and start talking."

"6442650","6443890"," Until that happens. "
"6446190","6448930"," Until that happens, that wouldn't be selling the market just yet."

"6463280","6464500"," So, um. "
"6466560","6468980"," I don't know that our markets solved either."
"6469120","6472980"," Ukraine news at the moment, but it looks like there is some news."
"6475720","6478380"," I just want to wait and see if. "
"6480760","6483620"," If it's picked up by new U.S. news, that would be the."
"6484260","6489400"," That would be the, um, the Lynch pin right until it comes into the financial news."
"6489740","6490540"," It means nothing. "
"6492560","6494880"," The way the market trading right now is just."
"6500330","6500890"," Yeah."
"6587140","6592520"," Maybe looking for something from the U.S. government, so you see something from our U.S. press. "
"6602830","6603950"," I'd give it a grain of salt."

"6625360","6626340"," That's like a sex thing, right?"
"6626660","6628020"," So edging is or something like that."
"6628100","6628800"," I've heard that term before."
"6629900","6632920"," So the E.C.B. Officials are. "
"6636120","6640340"," Edging toward a rate hike in 2022 to address inflation."
"6641540","6647100"," Let guard reiterate the view that U.S. and U.K. inflation situation."

"6694700","6700640"," Man, Roblox puts February 18th, 49 P for $45,000."
"6705270","6712310"," This weakness could be attributed to mostly to the put flow coming in from May."
"6713050","6716370"," Not necessarily market market weakness due to Ukraine. "
"6717490","6719470"," Could just be all these puts that are coming out."
"6719950","6722810"," There are some large put positions coming out right now."
"6723150","6725410"," And these aren't coming out in a panic either, right?"
"6725530","6730590"," We're not buying these more than not being sold or bought at the end of a bell as we crash"
"6730590","6732290"," through major support. "
"6732290","6733930"," They're being put on today."
"6735190","6737810"," You know, middle of the day, nothing going on in the market."
"6738650","6742730"," And after probably meetings and discussions for market direction. "

"6762170","6762270"," calls."
"6762270","6764350"," Talking about how this doesn't."
"6764410","6766850"," XPI calls in here and I didn't mention them. "
"6773890","6777410"," So the runway is running out on the spy."
"6777690","6779310"," I do wonder if there'll be a short squeeze."
"6780230","6782650"," Maybe as they get closer to the bell. "
"6783610","6787490"," And then possibly in re shorting for next week."
"6788530","6789290"," I'm interested."
"6789610","6796570"," I am interested if if we sit down here for long enough or enough time passes. "
"6797390","6800010"," No, this isn't guaranteed that it happens or anything."
"6800270","6808490"," But if we if we trade sideways into the bell, you would see hopefully short covering into the bell."
"6809670","6813310"," And then repositioning of shorts into next week. "

"6890370","6891990"," You don't want to see this break here. "
"6892330","6894890"," And you don't want to see this news that I'm giving you become news."
"6895830","6897770"," The more it becomes news, right?"

"8260379","8263480"," Sellers look like they're up at 43820."
"8263480","8265219"," I don't know if you can trade that high."
"8266200","8269959"," We can get a nice swing up above VWAP here to 43820. "
"8277730","8279070"," Sellers still hiding above."
"8285090","8290730"," Yeah, you don't send to when you have an invasion you tend to you tend to do PSYOPS first."
"8291910","8299790"," You start with PSYOPS and then they cut communications and then you would do artillery air"
"8299790","8304350"," bombardments and then you'd give people a chance to evacuate. "
"8304950","8309830"," So the evacuations that you're seeing now if they're real if we really are having evacuations that"
"8309830","8310650"," is step one."
"8311350","8314889"," That's part of the PSYOPS operations that typically take place."
"8315709","8317290"," You'll start to evacuate people. "
"8317350","8317930"," You'll drop leaflets."
"8319110","8321990"," You'll see news broadcasts, misinformation campaigns."
"8323389","8329170"," Then from there you'll see a cutting of communications and then you would see the bombardments of"
"8329170","8339110"," some kind and then you would see mechanized forces and they would enter and then behind that would"
"8339110","8339650"," be infantry. "
"8342709","8344270"," Infantry used to be tip of the spare."
"8344530","8346150"," It's not quite tip of the spare any longer."
"8349400","8351719"," And even at that today it's mostly mechanized infantry. "
"8353360","8370530"," It takes takes from Blitzkrieg from German doctrine from the 40s and"
"8370530","8371290"," a buildup of forces."
"8371549","8373430"," I guess that would be the first step which is you've seen, right?"
"8373930","8375129"," You've seen the buildup of forces."
"8375850","8377010"," That's step one, right?"
"8377230","8380770"," You kind of savorattle and all that kind of stuff back and forth. "
"8381450","8387730"," And then of course you give every option to not start the war or just, you know, to pull the"
"8387730","8387790"," communications."
"8388490","8391250"," The point you're saying that inflation is way too high right now but there are some reasons for"
"8391250","8392870"," optimism that it will come down."
"8393810","8394890"," Other comment from the feds, Williams?"
"8394890","8403280"," So you've seen the buildup of forces at this point. "
"8403440","8409940"," You've seen some communications being down."
"8410200","8412920"," That could just be noise though, right?"
"8413200","8414640"," You'll see real communications go down."
"8414780","8417240"," You would see, you know, just a blackout. "
"8418000","8420160"," But you've seen the buildup of forces at this point."
"8420980","8424940"," You've seen some psychological operations at this point."
"8425800","8429160"," The reports right now of evacuations. "
"8429920","8434620"," So you're starting to see, you know, we step in closer and closer towards conflict."
"8438890","8441150"," Now we are going into a weekend."
"8441690","8442570"," It is nighttime. "
"8443150","8448790"," You typically don't see too much action at nighttime unless you've seen other things in play."
"8449010","8457870"," My assumption is that they'll raise this stuff until they get some concessions from the EU or NATO,"
"8458430","8461410"," what I shouldn't say, you should say NATO, concessions from NATO."
"8461970","8463310"," And then it just spills over, right?"
"8464070","8466270"," Like you just, yeah, I pushed you. "
"8466390","8466890"," You pushed me."
"8467230","8467950"," You pushed me."
"8468110","8468670"," I pushed you. "
"8469390","8471230"," And until one person's."
"8471470","8476590"," Incrementally Russian press reporting that no one was heard in the explosion in the desk, which is"
"8476590","8477710"," reported to be a car bomb."
"8483570","8485550"," So I'm going to get out of some calls right here. "
"8485630","8486590"," I'm going to sell some calls."
"8493220","8493600"," Okay."
"8493920","8497560"," So we are coming up to where we left off. "
"8497580","8504240"," Finance leaders today saying they remain committed to developing rules to implement a global tax"
"8504240","8508980"," deal to ensure that it takes effect in 2023's final communicating."
"8510420","8516940"," Coming up to a point that was support now is resistance at 4567."
"8517660","8521880"," The book map's not showing it as resistance, but I'm out of calls at this point. "
"8521980","8527160"," I don't see any, I don't see any wall here."
"8530150","8537330"," I like seeing this bolstering here down at 434, but I can't, I'm not seeing any ice in here either,"
"8537330","8542090"," but at the same time, it's probably hidden sellers here that we don't know about."
"8544130","8549230"," And the real sellers are above that, I believe, 43820, or they were earlier. "
"8550970","8552870"," Yeah, they're still up here at 43820."
"8553110","8554150"," It looks like we've got real sellers."
"8554930","8556130"," So we could make another leg higher. "
"8556270","8562310"," Let's see if we can trade higher, if we can trade over this 43567 or so, if we can trade"
"8562310","8565170"," above it, we can take another trade to 43820."
"8574320","8576200"," I don't see any sellers there."
"8576500","8579960"," That believes the Fed can manage a soft landing for the economy. "
"8581160","8585480"," Oh yeah, soft landing, soft landing."
"8592120","8596460"," From the Ukraine foreign ministry, they are calling for a response from the international"
"8596460","8602480"," community, saying the lack of proper reaction or a neutral position will only fuel Russia's"
"8602480","8603980"," escalating situation."
"8604500","8606480"," Comments from the Ukrainian foreign ministry. "
"8609910","8618120"," I believe that, I believe that 100%."
"8631530","8639730"," If we don't find support here at 435, see these sellers just come in."
"8639870","8642270"," These are sellers that are hiding above. "
"8642910","8645150"," It's not showing on book map, but they are there."
"8645690","8652030"," See these 50, 60, 70,000 sellers hiding here, triggering another in the wave of selling."
"8652610","8656430"," We'll see if these sellers dissipate. "
"8656590","8659450"," If not, I might take another put position."
"8660130","8662110"," Actually, I might add some right now, just in case."
"8662940","8664330"," I might add some. "
"8666070","8670510"," William's saying there remains a lot of uncertainty surrounding supply chain issues and inflation."
"8671790","8679070"," So I just added a position on 430p for 43 cents."
"8681380","8686540"," We'll see if those help cut them loose, if we get below like 39 cents, 38 cents. "
"8691450","8693390"," Well, there's some resistance here."
"8693510","8696150"," We trade above 435, 52."
"8697850","8701790"," I'll take along the 438 because they were sellers hiding here. "
"8712360","8715720"," And I'm still expecting short covering at some point today."
"8715920","8721260"," I'm thinking I don't, I mean, can't guarantee it, but I would assume that you'd want to have"
"8721260","8725580"," cheaper prices for puts and shorts over the weekend."
"8726660","8728560"," So we'll look to see how long this lasts. "
"8734620","8740740"," Well, James, reiterating that raising interest rates from near zero levels in March makes sense on"
"8740740","8742640"," the very various scenarios."
"8754630","8757090"," I'm going to assume that we're going to read Tesla's."
"8760840","8762260"," Let's look back on. "
"8762840","8765900"," I think we already blew past Monday lows, right?"
"8767760","8770880"," 14th, the lows were 435, 67."
"8771960","8773020"," Right where you are, right?"
"8773400","8775120"," 435, 29."
"8776640","8777920"," That was Monday lows. "
"8778160","8781520"," Let's look back on previous lows and it's ugly."
"8783640","8793950"," So like previous lows from that point, price target would have a price target of you know, 430,"
"8794430","8795750"," 425, 420."
"8802150","8806930"," And I didn't even think about, I was talking about ranges for the month of March. "
"8807050","8812130"," I haven't even thought to look at are we going to have a green month yet on February?"
"8813470","8821430"," If you put together two red months, you put together January is red, February has read, there goes"
"8821430","8822870"," your red quarter, right?"
"8824630","8832250"," Regardless of where, where March winds up, March could be green, but it doesn't matter if you've"
"8832250","8834170"," now put together a red quarter."
"8836480","8840760"," So that would be an interesting daughter viewpoint, right?"
"8840920","8850480"," We've got 10 days left to February, the guess if you're a bull, you need us to trade"
"8850480","8851180"," to."
"8865660","8871680"," So we've got some some light spy calls coming in, looking to buy this dip into the close. "
"8872260","8876020"," It's by 218, 438 C for $36,000."
"8876820","8878600"," Let's just look at the month."
"8878920","8883260"," Okay, let's take a look at, I mean, you guys that we got to figure out all these things every"
"8883260","8893390"," month right as we come into an OPEX and we know that on February 1st, see here, February 1st, we"
"8893390","8901990"," closed at 458 on February 1st, on January 31st, we closed at"
"8901990","8903570"," 450. "
"8905170","8910530"," So the key would be if you were, if you're in the month of February, if you were not going"
"8910530","8916470"," to allow February to be a red month, you would need to trade close higher than 450 in the next"
"8916470","8918710"," 10 days, right?"
"8918950","8924970"," So if you're a bull, and you're like, you know what, Jim, you're crazy, there ain't no way that"
"8924970","8929930"," we're going to have another red month, then you should be targeting in the next 10 days that we hit"
"8929930","8930230"," 450."
"8930570","8936630"," You should buy yourself some 450 Cs expiring on the, was it the 28th, I think, right as the last"
"8936630","8936870"," day?"
"8937550","8947130"," Buy yourself some 450s, just 450 spreads, 448, 450 Cs, and"
"8947130","8948950"," that should print, right?"
"8949250","8955310"," If you're a bull, if you think that we're going to have a green February, because if you don't, if"
"8955310","8960570"," you don't think that we're going to be closing above 450, then there's your two months and there's"
"8960570","8965450"," your your negative quarter, and you guys can look back in history and look to see when we start"
"8965450","8972190"," stacking up months that are negative and we start stacking up quarters that are negative, and the"
"8972190","8977690"," damage and implication is it goes deeper and deeper into the year, believe it or not, it can take"
"8977690","8985390"," us, the recovery can take us somewhere, goes put to printing again, get some spy puts coming in"
"8985390","8988530"," February 18th, 432 P, $56,000."
"8990390","8995850"," Question becomes, you know, if you start stacking up, you know, you start stacking up months that"
"8995850","8999450"," are red, talked about this in the past, some of you guys have been around since the beginning,"
"8999610","8999710"," right?"
"9000290","9006170"," Then you get some more VIX calls coming out February 18th, 23.5 C, $53,000. "
"9006630","9013350"," You start to see your were stacking red months, then red quarters, you know, red quarter leads into"
"9013350","9019670"," do we have a second red quarter, you put two red quarters together, and you're looking for a year"
"9019670","9020470"," on the red."
"9022370","9029270"," So you're starting to have lower and lower price targets over time, and we'll see if this holds or"
"9029270","9030150"," if we trade higher here."
"9048310","9050090"," Let's look at the buyers and sellers. "
"9065880","9074100"," More BAC puts, February or September, July 15th, 40 P, $167,000."
"9075820","9081120"," So yeah, $430, maybe we bleed off into the belt of $430, unless we get a nice short covering."
"9083200","9085620"," And that's the hope that we get a short covering of the belt. "
"9086060","9090580"," If we go, if we don't cover in the clothes today, I'm going to be shocked."
"9096630","9098830"," That's some nasty shit if we don't cover in the clothes."
"9099330","9108450"," Oh, that's interesting on the Florida news. "
"9108850","9110310"," So we talked about that news, right?"
"9110610","9114850"," You guys remember when I talked about the spinoff on EV?"
"9115450","9117690"," You guys remember we talked about that two weeks ago?"
"9118270","9124870"," I told you that they were going to spin off EV, but they were building a building or turning a"
"9124870","9133410"," train station in Detroit into four EVs, and then decided instead of calling it the 40 EV center,"
"9133670","9137410"," they were going to call it just like an EV center."
"9137530","9141270"," They were going to allow other companies to come in and separate it from."
"9141630","9144550"," That was in Crane's business news two weeks ago. "
"9145590","9149250"," So interesting that it's being pumped for pumping the stock today."
"9151230","9152530"," That was public news on you."
"9152610","9159750"," You can just look up Crane's and the Ford spinoff news was in Crane's business like two weeks ago. "
"9188360","9197500"," $437.91. A lot of buyers versus sellers right now."
"9200220","9218100"," So I"
"9218100","9219560"," just cut loose some puts."
"9220860","9229400"," We'll wait and see if they can hold or not from even on puts"
"9229400","9235400"," on that round that random puts. "
"9269960","9272440"," See if we can find sellers above."
"9287890","9293530"," That's Williams repeating that it's important to have solid regulation of crypto currencies and"

"9947140","9948160"," It's not pretty."
"9949020","9953280"," If you just look back on the 14th we've broken through any semblance of support."
"9957560","9958640"," It's not looking pretty. "
"9964320","9968960"," Usually usually when you break through your weekly."
"9969720","9970540"," Not always."
"9972380","9977820"," But usually when you break through your weekly low it ain't pretty. "
"9980420","9984480"," I'm just looking at a 15-minute chart, the five-minute charts, one-minute charts that I'm now"

"9992810","9993410"," Not always. "
"9995530","9996870"," But it's not pretty."
"10000860","10001720"," It's not nice."
"10002480","10002940"," Not nice. "
"10006350","10008010"," As Borat would say."
"10011020","10013220"," And just on a smaller frame."
"10016070","10019080"," Like 428 is a price target for today. "
"10021640","10025300"," There's even there's even deeper price targets for today."
"10031210","10032730"," That doesn't mean we go there."
"10034130","10036790"," But in a four-hour chart spy is a mess. "
"10039170","10039910"," It is a mess."
"10042050","10043390"," It is a mess."
"10043690","10044910"," Like you scale out on a chart. "
"10045490","10048250"," We're going to be able to spy four-hour chart."

"10055680","10056320"," Yeah, you guys can hear me. "
"10060660","10062720"," It's looking pretty fucking ugly out there."
"10062840","10064000"," I'm going to be honest with you, okay?"
"10065940","10066720"," It's looking ugly."
"10067020","10068420"," Like you'll get a four-hour chart and the spy. "
"10068600","10069520"," You tell me that looks bullish?"
"10070940","10072080"," It might be bullish."
"10075840","10077480"," But on a chart it's not looking bullish."
"10080720","10082280"," The chart looks nasty. "
"10085220","10086440"," Like disgustingly nasty."
"10088220","10090000"," They called up a four-hour chart and just looked at it."
"10091000","10093800"," Does anything in that setup look nice to you?"
"10095640","10097900"," That setup looks gnarly. "
"10099800","10101040"," Like not good."
"10101420","10101740"," No bueno."
"10102960","10103920"," No bueno. "
"10105860","10109420"," Dude, look at the four-hour and then just look back on the Monday low."
"10116410","10119170"," I mean seriously, look at it in a four-hour chart."
"10119430","10120970"," Look at the spy in a four-hour chart, right?"
"10123440","10124260"," It's not pretty. "
"10128840","10129500"," It's not."
"10129840","10131480"," When you break the weekly it's not pretty."
"10133980","10134660"," It's not pretty. "
"10138820","10146860"," If we didn't break the weekly today, if we had held 4.35, it'd be like, yeah, it's neutral to"
"10146860","10148000"," possibly catch a bounce."
"10148560","10153940"," But now that I'm looking at a four-hour chart, like fuck no, it doesn't look bullish at all."
"10155780","10156940"," Not at all. "
"10157520","10163700"," You've broken through any semblance at this point of Italian known support."
"10163920","10167460"," Press reporting that the Italian government has approved energy go relief measures."

"10177200","10177920"," Share what you say."
"10178420","10179600"," This is not pretty."
"10182680","10183940"," It's another looking fucking chart. "
"10187180","10191400"," Looks like a chart that wants to capitulate down, to be honest."
"10192100","10195000"," The only thing that would say maybe no is because of OPEX."
"10195820","10202740"," I don't know, maybe OPEX would keep us up, I guess, or kicking around, but if you're looking at a"
"10202740","10205840"," four-hour chart, you're not pretty. "
"10209390","10210990"," Yes, porque, you know, right?"
"10211230","10211990"," You trade futures."
"10213910","10215130"," Just look at that chart out there."
"10216230","10217590"," Like, look at that chart. "
"10218490","10220590"," And then you try telling me that that looks bullish."
"10221810","10224210"," Yeah, I don't know."
"10225170","10227750"," I haven't seen many bullish setups like that out there. "
"10231170","10234610"," I've seen them after capitulation into a bell."
"10236830","10237870"," That's when I've seen that."
"10238050","10243110"," Like these setups work as a bull, but you're looking for a dipped by typically, and it's usually"
"10243110","10244510"," after a capitulation move. "
"10246150","10250610"," And it's usually at a bell, it's usually like, you know, four o'clock in the afternoon."
"10251570","10255490"," It's not typically at 12 o'clock on a Friday of OPEX."
"10257250","10266490"," It's typically Friday on a bell, or it burns on Monday, and that was the actual dip you should have"
"10266490","10266690"," bought. "
"10269830","10270890"," And it ain't looking pretty."
"10274230","10277950"," I don't think they have any charts on Google that you can look at."
"10278770","10280270"," Let's say this is where you buy. "
"10289530","10295980"," Yeah, I'm looking at the chart right now, and I'm like, eh, I don't know."
"10296380","10298560"," We're just kind of kicking around out here right now."
"10300240","10302100"," Got more slightly more. "
"10302280","10304660"," Yeah, it's kind of even, Steve, and you might find a little bounce here."
"10307080","10312830"," But I don't know if it'd be taking long, or maybe I'll eat my shoe or something."
"10315410","10317850"," I don't know, a larger time frame, like a four hour time frame. "
"10318710","10321470"," This shit looks like it's going to roll the fuck over into the bell."
"10322010","10323010"," Be honest with you."
"10324230","10326050"," Like, just looking at a four hour chart. "
"10326290","10327810"," It is not fucking pretty here."
"10328510","10330290"," And I was like, yeah, maybe the shorts will cover."
"10330890","10332830"," The shorts are looking at that four hour chart going. "
"10333130","10333550"," Hell no."
"10335790","10337010"," That's what shorts are saying."
"10337970","10340030"," The shorts are saying we ain't covering shit. "
"10341010","10341650"," We're going lower."
"10344470","10346370"," They got a five day chart."
"10346950","10350970"," Like, when we broke 435, that was the same pretty here. "
"10351570","10355030"," Just going to bring up the spot camera and see what they have to say."
"10355990","10357710"," And about a break below the 435."
"10358330","10359190"," I bet you it's not good. "
"10360810","10361750"," I bet you it ain't pretty."
"10365040","10367140"," It is amityville harving for real."
"10367960","10368600"," Look at the chart. "
"10368980","10370980"," Look at the chart in the four hour."
"10372080","10373340"," It's almost comical."
"10375260","10381700"," Like you look in the four chart in spite, it's just fucking imagine that chart in like a one month"
"10381700","10382860"," or a weekly chart. "
"10383240","10384900"," You'd be like, we're going down."
"10386380","10392960"," Like, condense that that four chart down like a, like, I don't know, like a 15 minute two day chart"
"10392960","10393720"," or something like that."
"10393820","10394540"," You'd be like, hell no. "
"10395180","10396340"," I ain't buying shit here."
"10399850","10400650"," Hell no."

"10408550","10409410"," We're going to trade down."
"10409530","10410570"," I think we're trading down here."
"10411170","10418010"," Not positive, but on the four hour chart, if I was a bull, I'd be wanting to throw up right"
"10418010","10418330"," now. "
"10420850","10421470"," I'd want to hurl."

"10677790","10679470"," March 8, more spy puts."
"10679790","10683970"," March 18, 413 p, 659,000 dollars. "
"10684510","10688250"," Spy puts February 18, 433 p, $8,500."
"10689030","10689350"," $8,500."
"10689770","10695290"," The stocks once again probing the lows of the day, the Dowdown 270, the S&P down 41 handles. "
"10701130","10703050"," No semblance of support here."
"10704070","10706690"," You get a little bit of dip buyers stepping in currently where we are."
"10709600","10711600"," Buyers are down below at 430. "
"10713920","10715080"," 433, 2."
"10716100","10717960"," And lower at 425."
"10718820","10726940"," We know that this OPEX there were put spreads taken out down to 42425 somewhere in there."
"10727700","10728900"," We covered those here. "
"10729520","10730760"," More spy puts."
"10732040","10736140"," February 18, 433 p, $85,000."
"10743050","10745250"," Do they print their spreads down here?"
"10745430","10746270"," Is the question right?"
"10748130","10751730"," Remember we were told no, they're not going to print their spreads down here?"
"10752370","10753850"," And you know what really sucks?"
"10754830","10760030"," As I sold some put spreads down here, it would have gotten paid big. "
"10760790","10765130"," I sold them as we were heading down, but I only gave like 10% on them."
"10765130","10769850"," Speedy governing council to hold an informal meeting on February 24th, according to a port."
"10771910","10775510"," But we've got a ton of put spreads out there. "
"10775810","10778730"," Big ones down here for OPEX."
"10780530","10782550"," I should have kept them."
"10782850","10785910"," Probably be printing like 80 to 100% today. "
"10787490","10791610"," QQQ's February 18, 341 p, $113,000."
"10792690","10794510"," I'm going to print these fucking spreads."
"10794770","10795570"," I don't care about you. "
"10798200","10799260"," 432, 85."
"10801400","10801920"," Currently."
"10810140","10815140"," Yeah, so all the puts for this for February OPEX was right around 420. "
"10816400","10820620"," All the puts for I think it was 430 to 420 between there and there."
"10820820","10826400"," And then the puts for March OPEX were rolled out for like 420 to 410."
"10826400","10834020"," And then the last two weeks we've seen puts coming in for May for below 400. "
"10837870","10839910"," We're now seeing March puts at 413."
"10841890","10846250"," So roughly 413, 410, 415 for March."
"10846730","10853300"," And then we've seen a ton come in for 390, 400 for May. "
"10855680","10858760"," So if we see three, I'm not saying we're going to see 390."
"10858760","10861220"," Last time when those came out, I said the same statement."
"10861940","10863860"," I'm not saying we're going to see 390. "
"10864840","10870880"," But if you're a bull, can you afford whatever you stock you're in to go down to spy going to"
"10870880","10871080"," 390?"
"10882500","10886560"," We're at the 12.05. 12 o'clock and five seconds."
"10890440","10894220"," Another weird thing would be let's say they sell it down into the bell today."
"10895720","10902900"," A short cover and then you try to buy calls for for Tuesday and we spring up on Monday or"
"10902900","10908840"," Tuesday, but you don't get to print those either because of the three-day weekend and theta. "
"10909260","10915320"," So if you're going to buy some calls for Tuesday, something in the money, I don't know that I don't"
"10915320","10917080"," know that I get them to expire from Monday."
"10917160","10918980"," I get them to expire from Monday for Tuesday."
"10919180","10920840"," I get them to expire for like Friday. "
"10921420","10927900"," Just remember, too, until next week, when we have a three-day weekend, not only do you get fucked"
"10927900","10935700"," on Monday being closed, but because we have Opexs on Tuesday, Wednesday, they typically will pin"
"10935700","10941520"," sometimes on those two dates and then you won't actually get what you wanted until Friday."
"10942180","10950820"," Let's say we trade up on Friday into Tuesday, right?"
"10951560","10954580"," And then they won't print those calls until Friday."
"10955120","10958540"," They'll actually fill fuck you all the way up until Friday. "
"10958780","10965140"," So if you were going to buy some calls into the bell today, maybe on a short cover, at any"
"10965140","10970020"," point, or if we don't short cover and we just, you know, sell down into the depths of hell into"
"10970020","10976380"," Friday clothes, then I would recommend that you get something that's like in the money that doesn't"
"10976380","10977920"," expire until Friday."
"10979540","10986320"," Not Monday, not Tuesday, not Wednesday, and make sure their spreads do not fuck around with just"
"10986320","10992180"," calls or just puts whatever side of that trade you're on."
"10992700","10998360"," Definitely, definitely get an expiry on those for Friday. "
"10998580","11003420"," Even if you close them on Tuesday or Wednesday, that doesn't always happen like this, but I"
"11003420","11012540"," guarantee it that it happens more often than not on a short week where they screw around with it."
"11013100","11014260"," Do not ever."
"11014580","11016400"," Just seeing some tweets here from RTS. "
"11016800","11022080"," Tony Connolly just laying the state of play ahead of a Monday E.U. UK joint committee meeting on"
"11022080","11027640"," the Northern Ireland Protocol saying that it's looking like the most we'll get is a joint statement"
"11027640","11034840"," to the effect that progress is being made and that talking should continue, or there could still"
"11034840","11038600"," just be two parallel statements as RTS, Tony Connolly."
"11044740","11049780"," Connolly just saying the key crunch point continues to be customs and how much level of checks and"
"11049780","11053280"," controls in the Great Britain Northern Ireland goods can be reduced."
"11058980","11066720"," So I guess the point being is the next week, right, you'll see the burn options on Tuesday, they'll"
"11066720","11071340"," burn options on Wednesday, then you'll get an actual move in between Wednesday or Thursday and"
"11071340","11073660"," Friday, whichever direction that you wanted. "
"11083580","11087360"," It's like a call spread down here at 430, date it for next Friday."
"11088000","11092880"," If you're bullish here, if you think we sell off into the bell, I think we do."
"11093240","11096960"," I mean, I think we saw off into the bell and we short cover or this will or this will"
"11096960","11102940"," be a bunch of short covers coverings and then we then we could get more short speed laid right on. "
"11102940","11110100"," That's why one concern is that no matter where we trade, if we trade to 440 or 450, that you're"
"11110100","11111920"," going to see a new round of shorting the market."
"11114620","11118520"," It's more like dunking someone's head under the water, you dunk them under the water, you let their"
"11118520","11123520"," head up and you redunk their head under the water and let their head up, redunk their head under"
"11123520","11123900"," the water."
"11139450","11141790"," Yeah, print my 415 P's maybe. "
"11147320","11148780"," We have a lot of bots in here."
"11149260","11150360"," Why are we getting so many bots?"
"11156800","11161580"," Yep, so the hero indicators, everybody know why the hero indicator is broken."
"11162940","11166100"," It's because options are not driving the market right now. "
"11166180","11174440"," You've got real money sellers, that means behind the scenes you've got banks that own large blocks"
"11174440","11183120"," of shares and they're selling regardless of what the option flow is, regardless of calls being"
"11183120","11183920"," bought, they're selling."
"11184400","11185660"," They're selling in mass."
"11186120","11187800"," That's why there's no liquidity in the market. "
"11188940","11191500"," So liquidity has to be provided into the market."
"11197450","11199650"," Yeah, soft landing that the Fed was talking about."
"11204110","11213200"," What's happening with cats out of the bag buying a full-on ground war starting at 4 p.m. Yeti,"
"11213300","11215260"," Mero, do you see that chart now?"
"11215460","11217840"," Looking at a four-hour chart, it's disgusting. "
"11219100","11220260"," Like it is wrong."
"11222440","11223800"," Look at a four-hour chart."
"11224100","11225620"," It is so ugly. "
"11226660","11231500"," I don't know how you could be like, oh yeah, we're going to go long here."
"11237680","11239560"," Yeah, I put wag in your time, my title."
"11240540","11247580"," Oh, I forgot about that whole wag thing. "
"11248720","11250000"," I don't forget about that."
"11250740","11253420"," These are the people that think that the earth is flat, right?"
"11254820","11257500"," The wag crew, like they think the earth is flat."
"11258560","11261980"," You think that the all kinds of wag shit's going to happen?"
"11268830","11270790"," Yeah, let's talk about some spreads real quick. "
"11271170","11271810"," Let's talk about spreads."
"11280330","11286480"," All right, so let's write down some ground rules for spreads."
"11286920","11287780"," Let's go basic spread. "
"11287840","11288720"," We're going to start right basic."
"11289640","11292620"," We're going to start basic with spreads."
"11294840","11295660"," Let's see here. "
"11295960","11297500"," A little out of second here."
"11301320","11302480"," Give me just a second."
"11302660","11305100"," I'm going to bring up my spread, where I trade spreads here. "
"11314140","11315260"," Let's talk about spreads."
"11320050","11323190"," Does anybody sign up for options.ai by any chance?"
"11323930","11330970"," If you've signed up for options.ai, log in to your options.ai account."
"11332470","11333870"," And we want to do a challenge. "
"11333870","11338050"," We want to do like a challenge of how do you turn a hundred bucks into a hundred thousand dollars?"
"11338310","11341750"," I think that's why I said turn a hundred dollars into a hundred thousand dollars."
"11342850","11347670"," To do that, I think it's 10 trades, but they need to be a hundred percent trades."
"11348010","11348730"," Now those are tough. "
"11349710","11357890"," You can't do it with spreads on 10 trades, but you can probably do it with maybe like 20 or"
"11357890","11360270"," 30 trades, I think."
"11362590","11365470"," If you don't have options.ai, sign up for it."
"11365590","11371170"," Get approved because it's one of the easiest ways to learn how to trade basic spreads. "
"11372690","11375910"," Watching some calls coming in queues, Hertz, baby."
"11376510","11381130"," HDZ for 14, 20 C for $650,000."
"11382090","11383570"," But let's talk about spreads. "
"11386430","11392270"," So, you know, you don't need spreads to, you don't need to trade spreads."
"11392970","11394250"," You can, let's start basic."
"11394530","11395830"," Like let's say just a stock trading. "
"11396150","11396770"," I buy a stock."
"11397050","11397770"," I buy a stock."
"11398030","11400290"," Let's say I buy, I don't know. "
"11402390","11404030"," Ford's a good one for today."
"11404450","11405630"," So, let's look at Ford, right?"
"11406310","11407850"," Let's say you're like, okay, I'm buying Ford."
"11408470","11410030"," So, I buy a share of Ford. "
"11411270","11412910"," All right, we'll just start basic here."
"11414970","11418890"," If you buy a share of Ford, you can sell not to share."
"11419090","11420370"," If you buy stock, right?"
"11420490","11428030"," If you buy a hundred shares of Ford, so you buy a hundred shares of Ford, you can then sell"
"11428030","11432170"," calls and sell puts against Ford, right?"
"11432610","11441130"," We could sell, you can open up some puts down to $15, $10 if you think this is the bottom"
"11441130","11442570"," on Ford, right?"
"11443790","11447890"," You can sell calls at $20 if you don't think Ford's actually going up. "
"11449610","11454350"," Especially if you're, especially, this is really good at market bottoms and at market tops."
"11454630","11459950"," If you see Tesla trading at some stupid number, and when Tesla was trading at $1,200, you start"
"11459950","11460470"," selling calls."
"11461130","11463350"," Even if you're an owner of Tesla, right?"
"11463490","11465730"," You're like, there's no way we're trading at $1,400 or $1,500. "
"11466530","11468630"," But people will buy those options."
"11470370","11476010"," Just like people like me will, I'll buy an outside the money call or put and hold it for just"
"11476010","11477030"," a brief amount of time."
"11477490","11478930"," Do I think we're going to $1,400?"
"11479250","11483450"," No, but do I think that $1,400 on calls is going to go triple double triple quadruple value?"
"11483450","11483850"," Sure. "
"11484390","11485810"," So there's a market for them."
"11486210","11489130"," Meanwhile, you collect the money off those, right?"
"11490130","11494010"," Off those people do it with with spy all the time."
"11494390","11496550"," People do it with an implied move on spy. "
"11496750","11502250"," You buy yourself a hundred shares of spy and you'll say, what's the implied move in the next month,"
"11502710","11503110"," right?"
"11503210","11504070"," And I just gave you one, right?"
"11504130","11509870"," I just told you, we'll probably trade down the month of May down to $4.15, let's say $4.20."
"11510650","11512390"," Probably won't close the month lower than that."
"11512770","11516950"," Probably won't close the month higher than $4.50 of March, right?"
"11517050","11517490"," We're talking about March."
"11518470","11519550"," So you start to plot and plan. "
"11520230","11521690"," You buy yourself a hundred shares of the spy."
"11521990","11527030"," You can, you can, especially, lead in this in a minute, but especially like the spy that closes the"
"11527030","11527270"," cash."
"11528590","11534610"," You can pick the implied range for that month, sell some outside the money calls and puts or puts,"
"11534730","11535230"," whatever you like. "
"11535810","11538110"," I might not recommend spy to do that on."
"11538530","11543450"," I'm going to talk to you about some others, some better stocks to do this with not Ford and spy."
"11544170","11545830"," Now, so let's say you're going to do that. "
"11545890","11546390"," That's your plan."
"11546510","11550430"," You're like, okay, I'm going to sell puts and I'm going to sell calls on a ticker."
"11551490","11552370"," There's a couple rules. "
"11553070","11554750"," First one would be I wreck never."
"11554830","11557190"," You're listening to trade the news."
"11557490","11562070"," Typically, I recommend that you do it on a cash on a stock or an index that closes to cash. "
"11563470","11567210"," If it doesn't close to cash, so like settled to cash."
"11567550","11568850"," So like spy settles to cash."
"11569150","11573230"," Shoggi confirming the government has approved a decree worth eight billion euros to support the"
"11573230","11573750"," economy. "
"11576180","11583360"," And then I try to pick tickers that don't have dividends or don't have dividends coming out or can"
"11583360","11586880"," be announced while you're holding against those dividends."
"11588120","11589840"," I'll get into that later down the road."
"11590540","11591900"," But right now, it's just a rule. "
"11592160","11595300"," You just try not to do those things."
"11596320","11597400"," So the next thing."
"11597760","11601780"," So let's say I'm going to pick a stock that I think doesn't move a lot. "
"11602260","11607940"," So you're going to get yourself on the finvis and you're going to find yourself stocks that never"
"11607940","11608460"," move."
"11609140","11611180"," So you're going to find yourself a stock that never moves."
"11611340","11612760"," Like what stocks don't ever move?"
"11612900","11616820"," What stocks trade sideways for a determined period of time?"
"11618480","11619940"," And let's say Clorox. "
"11620340","11624020"," Probably not Clorox, but I'm going to look at Clorox and see."
"11624420","11627920"," So like some kind of a Dow components company that never moves."
"11628080","11632240"," Draghi confirming six billion euros of that support package will go to curb energy bills. "
"11633580","11637260"," It will not be expanding its deficit to finance stimulus."
"11639160","11640280"," So that's like a Clorox."
"11640420","11641620"," We're probably at the best one to be looking at. "
"11642620","11644160"," It just traded down to $140."
"11646220","11647780"," Probably not the best one to be looking at."
"11648300","11653660"," But there are tickers out there that don't trade anything but sideways. "
"11654400","11655980"," Walmart used to be known for trading sideways."
"11657020","11658520"," But you'll find tickers out there."
"11658680","11662760"," You look at them over the course of a year and you see that they rarely trade out of their"
"11662760","11664240"," bounds, right?"
"11665240","11669220"," And you're going to pick that ticker to buy and sell puts or calls on. "
"11670380","11676580"," Incrementally here, separatists in the Dinesque region of eastern Ukraine now now reporting that"
"11676580","11680200"," they plan to evacuate around 700,000 people to Russia."
"11680940","11682200"," Holy shit."
"11682660","11688000"," Before the market opened this morning, we saw those initial reports that pushed tensions higher"
"11688000","11693880"," that the leader there in eastern Ukraine had indicated it would start evacuating some people to"
"11693880","11694520"," Russia today. "
"11694860","11698000"," Incremental report here saying it could be as many as 700,000."
"11698300","11703280"," Holy 430 peas are now down to 35 cents."
"11704880","11707420"," Might buy some of those if it's coming on big news now. "
"11708800","11709880"," Hold on, wait for me."
"11717530","11722370"," So the next thing that you do is you would find a stock that doesn't move a lot."
"11722690","11724950"," It's probably not Clorox but you can find them. "
"11725050","11726030"," You'll see people talking about them."
"11726530","11730090"," So you buy those stocks and you just sell outside the money, calls and puts."
"11730330","11731670"," It's like basic stuff. "
"11732750","11738810"," But the next thing you would do is for the next thing that I do is I try to earn"
"11738810","11739530"," free money."
"11740270","11742750"," So you can earn free money off tickers that don't move a lot."
"11743070","11744930"," You'll find people out there that will tell you all about them. "
"11745290","11749190"," That's been hard the past six months or so to find these tickers."
"11749670","11753230"," But you'll generally find tickers that don't move a lot."
"11753690","11756410"," They just trade sideways for long periods of time. "
"11756990","11761750"," And then you can usually figure out what times of the year that they do move and you can sell"
"11761750","11763650"," puts or calls against that stock that you own."
"11763870","11765870"," It's a nice pass of investing, a nice way to make money."
"11767170","11771490"," Next thing though is what we're going to talk about which is spreads, right?"
"11772070","11779490"," So when you're going to trade spreads, the most basic spreads that you can trade are typically, let"
"11779490","11781770"," me see, you can look at one right now. "
"11782530","11784490"," We'll look at spy real quick."
"11785730","11795110"," So basic spreads would be debit calls, debit puts, credit calls and puts are more"
"11795110","11795790"," complex."
"11797270","11800610"," Butterflies, condors, buying them, not selling them, just buying them. "
"11801150","11804790"," Now when you buy them, you can still cut legs off of these trades."
"11806130","11810870"," But if you were a brand new spread trader, you would just trade debit spreads."
"11811230","11812370"," They're very safer. "
"11813790","11817550"," They're safer than credit spreads if they go the wrong direction on you."
"11818150","11818890"," You can get into some trouble."
"11819550","11821630"," But just let's talk about debit spreads. "
"11822230","11824250"," So you're buying calls."
"11825950","11831250"," They're in the money and outside the money or you're buying puts that are inside the money and"
"11831250","11832130"," outside the money."
"11832490","11837670"," Depending on how wide your spread is, they are expiring the same date. "
"11838990","11840530"," Sorry, you're selling a call."
"11840790","11841110"," Apologize."
"11841330","11842470"," You're buying and selling a call. "
"11842810","11846570"," I think I'm talking ahead of myself here."
"11847510","11850590"," I don't trade debit spreads too often anymore."
"11850590","11860400"," So you're going to buy a call and sell a call if it's a"
"11860400","11861260"," debit call spread. "
"11861980","11865660"," And you're going to buy and sell a put if it's a debit put spread."
"11867710","11869510"," And normally you can cut these things loose."
"11869790","11873310"," You can cut one side on some trading platforms. "
"11873970","11876010"," I don't think you can do that in all trading platforms."
"11876170","11880510"," I think you have to have a margin account on some platforms to be able to cut them loose or"
"11880510","11881190"," not cut them loose."
"11881190","11883750"," I don't know how it works on Robinhood. "
"11884150","11891070"," I know on Tasty I have to have a margin account to make these trades so they can cut each"
"11891070","11893850"," leg off depending upon where it's moving towards."
"11896490","11901330"," So a debit spread or a net debit spread is an option strategy involving simultaneously buying and"
"11901330","11905830"," selling of options in the same class with different strike prices requiring a net outflow of cash"
"11905830","11907330"," for a debit for the investor."
"11907650","11909470"," The result is a net debit to the trading account. "
"11909470","11912970"," Here are the sum of all options sold as lower than the sum of all options purchased."
"11913730","11916110"," Therefore the trader must put up money to begin the trade."
"11916470","11919190"," The higher the debit spread the greater the initial cash flow. "
"11919670","11921330"," The trader incurs on the transaction."
"11923850","11925330"," Let me see what else it says here."
"11925770","11929630"," Spread strategies and options typically involve buying one option and selling another of the same"
"11929630","11934290"," class in the same underlying security with different strike price or a different expiration. "
"11935390","11937030"," So it could be different expirations as well."
"11937490","11942070"," However many types of spreads involve three or more options but the basic but the concept is the"
"11942070","11942330"," same."
"11942330","11946810"," If you had an income collected from all options sold result in a lower monetary value than the cost"
"11946810","11952430"," of all the options purchased result is an net debit to the account hence the name debit spread. "
"11953790","11956410"," And the converse is true for credit spreads right which is the opposite."
"11957210","11960850"," Here which in credit spreads the value of all the options sold is greater than the value of all the"
"11960850","11965010"," options purchased which is of course the result is a net credit to the account."
"11965570","11968150"," In a sense the market pays you to put on the trade. "
"11969490","11971170"," So here's an example of a debit spread."
"11971690","11976330"," For example you assume that trader buys a call option for two dollars let's say right and at the"
"11976330","11980950"," same time that the trader sells another call option of the same underlying security right."
"11981150","11984210"," So let's see if I call for two bucks right. "
"11985210","11992590"," Then you're going to sell the underlying security at the higher strike for $2.85 or $1.75 or"
"11992590","11993130"," something like that."
"11993750","11996310"," That's called a bull call spread right."
"11996410","12000470"," So let's say you buy it for a dollar for a dollar. "
"12000910","12003250"," Let's make it simple like the buy for a dollar right."
"12004210","12006730"," Then you sell one for 85 cents right."
"12007050","12012710"," The net's going to be 15 cents on that spread right and that's to begin your spread trade. "
"12013490","12017070"," Now there's a although there's an initial overlay on the transaction the trader believes the"
"12017070","12019450"," underlying security will rise modestly in price right."
"12019570","12024890"," So if you buy a bull call spread and saying that you think that it's going to go up from"
"12024890","12025070"," here."
"12025310","12028190"," So as a matter of fact let's look at spy right now we'll talk about it. "
"12028730","12031310"," So spy right now is trading at $434."
"12033110","12040970"," So I buy a bull call spread for let's expire next Friday and I think it's going up from here"
"12040970","12046330"," from where we are at $4.33. I think we're going to close high."
"12046630","12049970"," Now it doesn't have to close actually I shouldn't miss speaking here it doesn't have to actually"
"12049970","12057790"," close above $4.33. Let's say it by the the bull call spread I buy it at $4.32. Okay"
"12057790","12058810"," there's a few dynamics. "
"12059290","12064330"," One it has to close above $4.32 right for me to make any money or whatever it says I'm"
"12064330","12066250"," going to make next Friday."
"12066770","12071630"," I have a defined amount of risk and then I also have a defined amount of money that I can"
"12071630","12072530"," make off that happening."
"12072950","12078410"," If we go to $4.50 I'm not going to make like double triple of what I initially was going"
"12078410","12083550"," to make on the trade from here into Friday and the amount of money I'm going to make if the"
"12083550","12087490"," strike is lower than we car currently trading is going to leave me with less money. "
"12088470","12091730"," Let's say it costs me 10 bucks for that trade."
"12092270","12096610"," I might make $3 right and another problem is liquidity."
"12097470","12101990"," So if there isn't a lot of liquidity in a stock you might not be able to close those trades. "
"12102310","12106610"," You can probably open them sometimes you can't but if there's not enough liquidity you might not be"
"12106610","12109510"," able to close those trades until you get closer to expiration."
"12110930","12115790"," So let's just say today I've opened up a trade a bull call spread I say I know they were"
"12115790","12120230"," opening above $4.32 and $4.30 next Friday and I place that trade now."
"12120810","12122490"," It's going to be tough for me to close that trade. "
"12123630","12129070"," First of all it's going to be tough for me to open that trade right away right now because it's"
"12129070","12129870"," such an easy trade."
"12130410","12131890"," I probably have to pay a little bit extra for it."
"12132810","12137710"," Now to close that trade or to open that trade I'm probably going to wait for an open or a"
"12137710","12138710"," close on the market. "
"12139150","12143390"," So I'm going to wait for like when we're closing the day out and we're opening the day out."
"12143510","12149290"," The next thing I'm going to consider is opexes week daily weekly and monthly opexes quad whichings"
"12149290","12155510"," because a lot of activity takes place around these moments in the market in regards to spreads."
"12156090","12162610"," When people open and closing spreads that's why when you see all these moves at 9.30 to 9.45"
"12162610","12170130"," 10 o'clock when you see all these moves in the market and in the afternoon between 3.30 and"
"12170130","12172910"," 4 p.m. is because people are opening and closing spreads. "
"12173390","12178070"," You've got this meeting of people coming together saying yeah I want that I don't want this I want"
"12178070","12183490"," this I want that right mostly has to do with spreads of those times in the market on the day"
"12183490","12185110"," and on the on the opexes."
"12185110","12190070"," So you already automatically want to say to yourself what am I going to buy this probably at the"
"12190070","12194250"," end of the day today probably going to wait for the price at the end of the day and see"
"12194250","12197730"," if I can get the best price that I can for a weekly spread expiring next Friday."
"12198630","12203090"," I'm also going to get the most liquidity out of the day and at the end and the start of"
"12203090","12207010"," the day so I can open and close these contracts at a price that I want right. "
"12207730","12213890"," So liquidity is a big issue closing the cash is a big issue another big issue is when you're"
"12213890","12218230"," opening closing these things and the direction that you think the market is headed in."
"12218670","12225290"," So instead of saying yeah right now at this moment today we're at 4.33 whoof maybe we go down"
"12225290","12230610"," today or that risk of going down let's say about a call for next Friday for 4.33 it can"
"12230610","12235910"," get destroyed between now say about 4.30 call between now and next Friday there's intrinsic and"
"12235910","12241950"," extrinsic value on those calls as time passes I'm probably going to lose a lot of intrinsic value"
"12241950","12242670"," in that call right."
"12242810","12247910"," So that sucks if I buy a month one month I'll call because of high frequency trading firms today"
"12247910","12252630"," our market goes up and down up and down destroying intrinsic value in calls now I have to buy them"
"12252630","12257510"," three months out right hopefully that they still print hopefully hopefully that they'll still still"
"12257510","12260870"," print and then we'll move up to that target that I'm looking for. "
"12260870","12268130"," Now what spreads do even with market volatility if my with my ultimate viewpoint is yeah I'm"
"12268130","12273170"," bullish here at least in the next week I can buy a 4.34.32 call here and not have"
"12273170","12277790"," to worry about a bunch of stuff I don't have to worry about volatility as long as we trade higher"
"12277790","12282210"," than 4.32 and next Friday I don't have to worry about the intrinsic value of the calls getting"
"12282210","12284130"," murdered between now and next Friday."
"12284930","12290290"," The only thing I'm worried about is market direction we trading higher than 4.32 next Friday I"
"12290290","12294590"," don't have to worry about liquidity in the market because I know at the bell on next Friday there's"
"12294590","12298710"," going to be a ton of it we also know that we sell the cash so I have to worry"
"12298710","12302430"," about dividends being paid out on the spy for at least this week I don't have to worry about"
"12302430","12307250"," anything any kind of craziness like that right so my last thing that I'm worried about is if we"
"12307250","12314070"," trade wildly to one side and then get and I get a it's not called executed but it's basically where"
"12314070","12318570"," they close one side of my option so like spy is perfect for a trade like this so I'm going"
"12318570","12326670"," to buy 4.30s 4.32s seas expiring next Friday right pretty safe bet right let's say we have an"
"12326670","12333570"," implied move and you think oh no maybe we could have more volatility this week cap it's crazy sauce"
"12333570","12340310"," right we could trade down from here into Monday and things that could get crazy between here Monday"
"12340310","12345470"," right like an open that up that bull call spread up I can make it like 415 to 440 I"
"12345470","12351690"," could also do condors or butterflies and just capture a trading range from now into next Friday"
"12351690","12358290"," we'll talk about those later now but for bull call spread trading into next Friday I think we're"
"12358290","12362490"," going up because if you think we're going sideways if you think we're within a range you pick"
"12362490","12370310"," condors or butterflies if you think you're bearish you could buy some bull put spreads not bull put"
"12370310","12374890"," bear put spreads and say well I don't think we're ever going to trade above 4.32 cap I think"
"12374890","12380510"," we're going to trade anything but above 4.32 next to next Friday you could go the opposite side and"
"12380510","12385570"," buy a put spread right so let's just assume that we're going into next Friday we're going to trade"
"12385570","12391870"," higher than 4.32 we're going to trade higher so I'm going to buy that bull call spread right it's"
"12391870","12398870"," going to be cheaper entry I've got less risk on my my viewpoint is that we're going up now there's"
"12398870","12405770"," some issues within this trade let's say we go up from now into next Friday we start trading up we"
"12405770","12413310"," trade up to 435 hover around 435 on Tuesday Wednesday we get the weekend theta bullshit we get"
"12413310","12419610"," opexes on Wednesday or excuse well Tuesday and Wednesday I might make like on that call I might"
"12419610","12429030"," make 20 to 30 percent and I might not make I might make even 50 percent leading into Tuesday or"
"12429030","12436130"," Wednesday but I'm not going to make the 100 percent on that trade until expiry on Friday and that's"
"12436130","12441490"," where you see all your wonky shit happen and I want to give a point in this if you look"
"12441490","12449430"," right now in the last five days on the spy right if you had calls let's say on the 14th"
"12449430","12458110"," let's say you bought calls in the 14th right in the money calls lo and behold lo and behold they're"
"12458110","12464350"," not printing on a weekly call if you bought a weekly call spread last Monday they're not printing"
"12464350","12470430"," if you bought a weekly call spread in the money last Friday they're not printing currently right"
"12470430","12475030"," it's that's a big one right think about the past past week you say to yourself are they gonna print"
"12475030","12480490"," right and currently on this Friday if you bought a book called spreads last Friday down at the lows"
"12480490","12486170"," which were which was 440 those aren't printing right now if you bought them on Monday they're not"
"12486170","12493030"," printing right now not not currently in the market those aren't printing today so if I buy a bull"
"12493030","12498190"," call spread let's say today for next week and we trade higher on to Monday or into Tuesday or"
"12498190","12502470"," Wednesday and I'm at 20 percent 50 percent gains I'm probably going to take my money and run"
"12502470","12509670"," because otherwise there's two two things that'll happen to you your your OPEC state shenanigans"
"12509670","12517710"," happen they'll trade the market down or up depending upon who has more bull or bear spreads they'll"
"12517710","12522870"," try to murder those options those spreads into OPECs and then the other thing is that you're"
"12522870","12530230"," waiting five days to make 100 percent of that trade right so if I just closed bull call spreads"
"12530230","12534870"," last from last one Monday or Friday on this past Monday or Tuesday I would have made a ton of"
"12534870","12540110"," money I would have made 50 percent of my trade and I can get back into a different trade heading"
"12540110","12546190"," later into the week so we have Wednesday high right here on the 16th and then I've got the lows"
"12546190","12554430"," on Thursday and Friday so my bet is that last Friday and Monday a bank came in or hedge fund"
"12554430","12561390"," they bought a bunch of call spreads they printed them up to 448 closed all those and then they now"
"12561390","12567750"," have bear spreads heading into the OPEC of this Friday does that make sense I guess following along"
"12567750","12577640"," up there so what does this mean what does this all mean right"
"12577640","12583760"," here let's let's dumb all this down okay let's just dumb all this down so dumb it all down okay"
"12583760","12590880"," we're just gonna get simple as pie so we're gonna make this super simple now credit spreads will"
"12590880","12595320"," print directionally and those are more complex we'll get into those another conversation different"
"12595320","12601040"," time because they're more dangerous just just let's get into debit call spreads debit put spreads"
"12601040","12606900"," typically you'll make anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of your profit within the trade if it's direct"
"12606900","12614260"," going in the direction that you want it to go in number two if they fail let's say today I"
"12614260","12621680"," buy 432 434 32 C's expiring next Friday we start trading down into this Bell and we trade down on"
"12621680","12626520"," Monday Tuesday excuse me Tuesday Wednesday they could more than likely still print come into next"
"12626520","12633840"," Friday probably swing higher into Friday's expiry okay now probably get my ass saved right at the"
"12633840","12639420"," Bell you'd have to hold them so if you enter a bull or bear put or call spread and we"
"12639420","12645720"," start going the wrong way for you I typically hold those into expiry I'll typically fucking diamond"
"12645720","12652420"," hand those either side puts or calls I'll tip if I pick the wrong direction I'll hold the diamond"
"12652420","12661600"," hand those bad boys right into 359 p.m. on expiry now never hold spreads past 4 p.m. on"
"12661600","12668420"," expiry ever I don't care what to trade and don't ever ever ever because after hours you will see an"
"12668420","12673940"," expiry a bunch of what wack shit happened and different markets close at different times they'll"

"13009960","13014580"," like put some more put spreads on they're almost guaranteed to print that's because we're swinging"

"13085100","13093040"," bought a you bought a 430 and a 428 here right and we trade lower than 427 and then trade"
"13093040","13097860"," up to 430 you're probably not going to make any money there you're going to need us to trade you"
"13097860","13101860"," don't need the market to trade higher at that point so it also does matter when you buy them to"

"13131160","13139460"," a 5% move up and the bears are expecting a 5% move down so the bulls are expecting"

"13147460","13152660"," we're going to trade as low as 411 into march okay and you have seen calls and puts come out"
"13152660","13158180"," today reflecting that move no that's what we're going to trade to so if you're to take a month out"
"13158180","13166680"," call or bear or or a bull debit spread you could probably take both sides of that trade and"
"13166680","13171500"," probably get prints off both sides at some point this month do I think that I would I should buy"
"13171500","13181420"," 454 442s today probably not probably buy in the money bull spread and in the money bear spread and"
"13181420","13187220"," watch the two of them print at some point in march now why do I do these things I do"

"13226780","13231840"," on on puts or something like that right so it's like insurance that I know I'm going to get that"
"13231840","13238660"," money back regardless at some point market trading down a 432.59 currently market on a four hour"
"13238660","13243840"," chart is very bearish right now if you're just joining us earlier today if you're looking at the"
"13243840","13251380"," market on a four hour chart it is disgusting nothing saving this market heading into the bell I"
"13251380","13257880"," wouldn't be shocked to be honest with you if we saw 430 today or even lower into Tuesday if you"
"13257880","13263120"," do see a war with Ukraine it would not shock me to see us trade down a 420 I know"
"13263120","13268580"," that's really crazy to say I can't say that it's guaranteed but the way that our charts are looking"
"13268580","13275980"," in the four hour is real bad like it's ugly 430 definitely on the on the table for right now"
"13275980","13287350"," now 425 is let me see not 425 I'll give you three targets okay 430 uh 428"
"13287350","13296750"," 57 and believe it or not uh 420 426 and"
"13296750","13303890"," then right back down to 420 like some nasty nasty price targets below in the market today hopefully"
"13303890","13310270"," you guys are making money out there uh trading this market down and we are bouncing right now 432"
"13310270","13316210"," 52 but there are some lower price targets in this market guaranteed even if there are buyers here"
"13316210","13325930"," and so an example another example this would be when we were at the highs three days ago at 440"
"13325930","13333710"," hey right I think we're on the highs we were in the highs at 448.05 at the bell on"

"13354790","13360970"," and those didn't press any gas options they went down to 60 I think about them for a dollar 20"
"13360970","13368310"," went down to 60 cents on Thursday now let's say you buy calls here on Wednesday you bought some"
"13368310","13373010"," calls you're gonna buy some zero dates on a leg up right you you're paying for those calls let's"
"13373010","13380710"," say they cost you uh I don't know a dollar then you're gonna buy some put spreads to protect that"
"13380710","13387810"," trade that would expire on Friday or Monday of next week right because even if we gap up you know"
"13387810","13393050"," we're gonna come back down to retest this 448 you know at some point we're coming back down here so"
