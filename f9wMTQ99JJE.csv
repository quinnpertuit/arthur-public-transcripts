"4740","6360"," I think I make some playlists."
"7039","8580"," I need to hire my kids."
"9040","9800"," That's what I need to do. "
"11420","15250"," And where's my water?"
"16650","17930"," Let's see if we're live."
"24660","25600"," Alright, sweet."
"28980","30080"," We are live. "
"71860","78010"," If anyone's here right now, let me just a second."
"102220","103440"," Can people show it up?"
"103980","104580"," Right on."
"105700","106840"," Do I have a boyfriend?"
"107180","114360"," Brad, Matt, Betty, Mac, William, Juice, 3.89, Brad, Curtis, Rob, Benjamin, Binky, John, Troy. "
"115080","120860"," All the way, Ben, Matthew, Michiche, Chaz."
"121500","122500"," Good to see all of you."
"123960","126000"," She got a solid post on Twitter then, too. "
"130300","130840"," Happy holidays."
"131180","132560"," Anybody that's celebrating a holiday today?"
"150510","151890"," Hello, Frotron."
"153370","155710"," Omar, how are you, ex, Garrett, endless. "
"156970","159130"," Jasmine, Joe, Bobcat, Missy."
"159730","160650"," Good to see everybody."
"163010","164490"," Hope everybody's doing well. "
"165430","168490"," Let me change my brightness level here."
"176860","176980"," Okay."
"178240","178820"," Hey, Guac. "
"179800","180660"," The King Kong."
"180820","181340"," Good to see you."
"184030","185790"," Hope everybody's doing well this evening. "
"188760","193620"," Before we get into, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll let people pile in here."
"195220","196980"," My numbing day today."
"198020","198640"," Yeah. "
"198960","200820"," So we'll talk about that."
"204440","209760"," It's not, it's not all bad right now, but there are some forces in the market."
"210300","212800"," You know, we had OPEC's this past week. "
"213400","218630"," The month actually wraps up and the quarter still continues to wrap up as we head into."
"219750","220870"," The 31st."
"221510","225690"," And we're all really positioning for January through March. "
"226150","229490"," Some of us just have more weight than others, right?"
"233070","235930"," We missed your soothing voice during the mayhem today."
"236430","237690"," Yeah, you know, I got cut."
"237990","239090"," So I had a couple of issues. "
"239210","243630"," I had my children were away at their grandmother's house."
"243630","245730"," They came back home this afternoon."
"246190","247850"," I didn't really have too much. "
"247850","249790"," Of an option."
"249830","253610"," It's weird too, because I put on a long spy call."
"254310","257390"," This morning, and then I bought at end of day. "
"258510","260230"," A hedge as well."
"260529","264330"," So I'm invariably, I'm in a straddle type situation myself right now."
"266460","269760"," It was what's surprising about this straddle that I'm in. "
"270240","272180"," They're, they have different dates."
"273220","276500"," And I believe they both will both sides will print."
"276500","280140"," In some fashion, both will be green at some point. "
"285040","286900"," Nvidia even crew looks strong."
"287860","289220"," Holding Nvidia weeklies."
"289940","291680"," Love all of you guys out there. "
"292180","295860"," I wish I could have been here for you at part of the day at least today."
"296300","298700"," You have me back tomorrow full time."
"299300","301980"," Things have settled down around here slightly, I hope. "
"303580","305120"," As you know, it is the holidays."
"305460","305920"," Things are crazy."
"306720","309520"," Kids out of school got family and friends coming around. "
"310360","314720"," So there are parts of the day where I can't be here 100% of the time."
"317590","319030"," Yes, sir, a family first."
"319610","319830"," Yeah. "
"319990","323350"," And I, you know, it's weird because my youngest daughter, I hadn't seen her in a few days."
"325150","328010"," And we ended up cuddling later in the afternoon today."
"328570","333530"," And all she wanted to do is play some Roblox and sign up for the, I gave her. "
"333530","337090"," Her first Roblox money."
"337290","338530"," She's never had Roblox money."
"339670","344030"," And she doesn't know how to upload the card and all that kind of stuff. "
"350600","351960"," Excuse my coughing too."
"352280","353220"," I've been talking a lot."
"354280","359160"," Not sick or anything, but I've got a sore throat from speaking so much of the mornings. "
"360600","363460"," So I've had to get some, I got the old school loutins."
"364240","368280"," That you remember when you're a kid and your school wouldn't allow you to have cough drops."
"368880","371860"," If there were loutins, I don't know if anybody remembers loutins. "
"372240","376760"," There are basically candy that you could pretend you could eat candy in school when you weren't"
"376760","377300"," allowed to."
"383220","386940"," Yeah, I did want to mention that before we get started too."
"387460","391480"," I was so impressed today looking at the chats and people helping each other out. "
"391840","393580"," It really made my day seeing that."
"393580","397680"," I wanted to talk briefly about discord on that topic as well."
"398560","402580"," You know what we can do is you can stay connected in your regular. "
"403680","407400"," If you only have one screen or two screens out there."
"407440","410260"," If any of you are trading on like laptops, desktops, that kind of stuff."
"410900","413720"," We're discord because I'm in a couple, I'm in a few discords. "
"415000","420560"," Now, let's say I spend majority of my time on Twitter."
"421980","424160"," For my social media interaction."
"424780","429020"," But when I have a discord that I have that I'd have unmuted. "
"429580","436420"," Even if the screener is not up, I'll get little pop up boxes that keep me abreast of whatever the"
"436420","437800"," conversation is."
"438340","441900"," On that discord channel that I'm trying to pay attention to."
"441900","447160"," And I know discords can become very, there's too much clutter or. "
"449220","451040"," There's too many speakers."
"453600","457220"," Or people can be really mean and discord sometimes."
"457820","464920"," I can sometimes be a group think that goes on in discord that. "
"465660","468080"," It can be positive or it can be negative."
"468080","470660"," But sometimes they're really good."
"471000","472600"," The best discords that I've seen. "
"474820","477860"," Usually there are very few channels."
"478600","479960"," One, two or three."
"480880","484800"," There's usually a dedicated group of people that are. "
"485600","486800"," Actively trading."
"487260","489720"," Either futures or cash markets."
"490420","493560"," If you have that dedicated group that are. "
"493960","496500"," Actually trading the market day in day out."
"497140","499600"," Those tend to be some very productive channels."
"501260","504940"," And you need to have the bears and the bulls get along. "
"506080","508960"," And be traders, be investors and be there to make money."
"509860","511080"," Or at least tacitly get along."
"511460","513460"," And then usually a third channel for investors. "
"514539","516020"," Where the investors talk."
"517000","518600"," Now if you guys want something like that."
"518600","521360"," I can buy a taste art. "
"521960","523900"," Trading ticks has some mods."
"524740","527500"," Where you can look for trade setups as well."
"528260","529700"," That actually is a pretty good program. "
"530320","531360"," It's trading ticks offers."
"532340","535380"," So it gives you some tools to use within a discord."
"538430","540330"," Yeah, it wouldn't be open to the public. "
"541190","544350"," The discord community, it would be something rigid and more structured."
"545830","547570"," So we would have to structure it for sure."
"548420","548730"," And. "
"550110","553630"," We really, you really want, and to be honest with you, you really want."
"555760","560940"," Active traders controlling the discussion that consistently make money."
"561380","563360"," And feel confident and comfortable. "
"564880","567100"," Discussing and working with other traders to."
"567720","569900"," To produce actionable trades."
"570700","576340"," And I think sometimes when you create a discord, you'll find volunteers that will help with that"
"576340","576840"," discussion. "
"577480","579000"," That know what they're doing."
"579420","584840"," I know there's a few traders in our community that know what they're doing that actively trade."
"586100","589260"," They could lead or at least not be muted. "
"589260","592020"," You can even have some unmuted channels for just like a general discussion."
"592660","597000"," Like a shit posting handle, let's say, where you just, you had to free for all."
"598260","600000"," And then you have like a pro discussion. "
"601400","601440"," Where."
"602940","606940"," There's just a small group, five or 10 people and the rest of you would just ask questions."
"607500","608260"," I don't understand this. "
"608400","609380"," Can you explain that to me?"
"610120","612460"," But when we're when they're actively trading, they would be in charge."
"612580","614520"," They would have the power, maybe to mute other people."
"615520","620040"," Or some sort of a hierarchy where you make five or 10 trusted traders. "
"621120","625480"," And if they find people in the general discussion that seem to be making money."
"626400","627380"," You could request."
"627740","629040"," Hey, can you let me into the discussion?"
"629580","631740"," Can you check my post history in the open discussion?"
"632320","633300"," There's something we can do. "
"635400","637460"," There are actually some great trainers."
"638080","642980"," Whether you guys know it or not within the people that follow our community."
"643500","645460"," There are some great traders that make a lot of money. "
"645720","646480"," They do very well."
"647060","647760"," You'd be surprised."
"648380","649480"," I'm not going to name names here. "
"651140","656440"," But I know I review every person that requests access to the handle."
"657160","658120"," And there are some great traders."
"658800","660580"," If they make themselves known on Twitter. "
"661380","663360"," If any of you out there that are listening right now."
"664480","668120"," And if you're not listening, if you listen later and watch this stream later, if you guys want to"
"668120","669060"," reach out in a DM."
"670160","675460"," And you want to actively work within a discord, it would be a free discord sub that it would be"
"675460","678620"," invite only to the whoever subscribed to the handle. "
"678620","683860"," And then of course, you'd come in and you'd be muted on the trading channels for e at or for"
"683860","685100"," Globex and for cash."
"685680","687960"," But there'd be a general discussion that you can introduce yourself."
"688340","690720"," Talk about your trades and your setups and your investments. "
"691460","694280"," And then if you're like, hey, look, I'm posting these trades that are working."
"694760","696420"," Can I get involved in that sub?"
"696840","698580"," They would review your content and let you in."
"698840","703940"," And if you felt as though you're being slighted in that way, you can always contact me and we can"
"703940","705120"," find out if they just don't like you. "
"705120","708200"," Because, you know, we have to put personalities aside to some extent."
"708860","713640"," And we really do want to be focusing on people that are actively trading and are they making money"
"713640","714000"," or not?"
"714220","715420"," You want to be following those people."
"725970","727610"," Yeah, so let me keep chewing on it. "
"727730","730470"," I need another day or two to figure it out in my head, how it would work."
"731010","732770"," But you'd need to have some people step up."
"732850","738290"," If you had maybe a core group of three to five or Globex traders, you get a core group of"
"738290","739110"," cash market traders. "
"739710","741970"," Maybe maybe a core group of investors."
"742490","747870"," You know, there's a guy named Tesla Wolf that's on Twitter, and he's a longtime stock investor."
"748650","751230"," Like some guy like that and an investor channel. "
"751750","756350"," They could craft and curate some form of an investment."
"756590","759110"," You know, who else does a great job with that is acquitted vests."
"759550","765470"," Does an amazing job with curating an investment profile. "
"765890","769090"," So if we find a few people like that that would like to work together."
"769650","772610"," And then what you do is you'll let everyone else into the room from the handle."
"774750","780690"," You get asked, you get, you get, you get allowed into the general discussion where we have our own"
"780690","783030"," policing guidelines, right, and race chatting. "
"784190","787470"," You get to read the pro traders, I guess."
"787570","791390"," They're not really pro traders, but you know that you get to see the active day traders trading."
"791390","797370"," And then if you're posting and discussing your ideas in the general channel, you would then at some"
"797370","801390"," point say, Hey, look, you know, posting and I'm interacting with the community. "
"801590","803870"," Do you mind if I join you, you."
"804570","806950"," Active day trading or active Globex trading."
"807590","808070"," Whatever. "
"808470","813230"," And I could put the trading trade takes has some tools that I can buy that would give you maybe"
"813230","815090"," one more room that you could look for setups."
"815090","820090"," If you wanted to back test ideas or let's say you're like, we're all going to play."
"821370","827070"," I don't know, you pick a pen pins Home Depot and you guys want us to research some stuff within"
"827070","830070"," the, the, the discord. "
"830670","834570"," And then whenever I'm live streaming, I could, I could put a live feed in there every day."
"834950","836630"," So you have an actual live feed."
"837030","838410"," You could discuss trades. "
"838790","839970"," I could put it in the general discussion."
"839970","843330"," And then you guys could just actively discuss it as an entire group."
"843690","846350"," You don't have to worry about the public seeing your discussion. "
"846350","851110"," You have to worry about how you're viewed publicly and that kind of stuff."
"854570","857110"," I can teach what not to do inverse my trades."
"857670","866090"," Yeah, no, in the, the Globex, you'd have that Globex discussion where it would involve the RUT or"
"866090","866450"," RTY. "
"866970","868050"," It would involve NQ ES."
"868770","870110"," You just have an equities channel."
"871190","872030"," No, no, no equities. "
"872170","878350"," A Globex channel for a few, that includes futures that includes the MES, the AES, anything,"
"878370","880510"," anything that's to do with the Globex market."
"881010","888290"," The Globex market is your equals pajama traders, equals overnight trainers, anything you want to"
"888290","888630"," call that."
"889010","889770"," That's that whole group. "
"895810","900150"," Yeah, so we need to talk about, so we're going to start this off right now."
"901690","902950"," And we're going to start the night off."
"903030","903570"," This is the daily brief. "
"903750","904630"," I'm going to start this right now."
"904710","905390"," We've got enough people here."
"905450","906570"," We've got 74 people here. "
"906990","910510"," We have a brief discussion about a discord channel."
"911770","914530"," I'm going to try to get that up and running for you here within the next week."
"916960","918960"," And the, it'll be a structured thing. "
"919240","921660"," Some, there are some really good discords out there."
"922500","924960"," And there are some really, really bad discords out there."
"925700","927720"," So we have to be careful on how we launch something like that. "
"928360","931780"," Now, happy boxing day to any of you out there."
"931800","934500"," If anybody's watching this program at any point in your, from another country and you're"
"934500","935860"," celebrating a holiday, Happy Holidays."
"935860","941660"," Hope you're happy, safe, that you're with family, friends, or if you prefer to be alone, that"
"941660","942920"," you're in a happy space as well. "
"945530","948250"," We are at the end of year still."
"948490","950710"," We are still in an op-opec cycle."
"952170","955950"," These, these, so everything I'm going to talk about tonight are knowns, okay?"
"956390","958370"," These aren't things that are open to discussion. "
"959270","960630"," I'm going to give you some black and white things."
"961370","965070"," These are concrete things that you can rely upon as we're heading into the end of the year."
"965070","968350"," And we are still in op-ecs. "
"968910","975990"," We have much larger players out there that have to make very large moves for January through March."
"976750","979870"," That will impact the market, okay?"
"980870","987530"," And we will see some weird movements, swings, why do things not go up, that kind of stuff, as we"
"987530","988010"," move forward."
"989150","995530"," There is some real risk in this market right now between now and the beginning of next week. "
"996910","1006170"," There is a chance, I would say the chance of volatility and weakness in the market is almost a"
"1006170","1006750"," short thing."
"1007430","1016650"," It's anywhere from a 70 to a 90% chance that there will be volatile moments in this market."
"1016650","1023150"," So if I say to you just for no matter where we were right now on the charts, I would"
"1023150","1025130"," tell you expect volatility. "
"1026290","1033050"," And so if we're at a high and I say to you like so I said to you on Friday"
"1033050","1038190"," and then I said to you on Monday and I said to you on Tuesday, even while we're clawing our"
"1038190","1041010"," way back to the day I said to you, put a hedge on."
"1041010","1046329"," So I was asking before and now I'm telling, okay?"
"1046349","1053230"," So I have a hedge on, if you don't have a hedge on, you hear this becomes repetitive, right?"
"1053750","1058330"," Where I say to you, if you don't have a hedge on, don't come back to me and say you're"
"1058330","1058970"," losing your money."
"1060690","1063990"," I've explained how to put the hedge on at this point. "
"1064430","1067310"," You can buy single day hedge protection."
"1067370","1070250"," That's a few pennies or 20 cents."
"1070490","1075130"," Let's say it's within it's within five or 50 points depending on how you come to stock market. "
"1075130","1083410"," So if we're at 478, you'd buy 474 peas a day or two out, I've talked to you about banks"
"1083410","1085750"," that will be putting hedging on throughout the week."
"1086670","1091630"," We've seen weakness with different hedging strategies coming into the market."
"1091970","1095510"," We've seen positiveness with long, long hedging. "
"1095590","1100750"," We've seen some negative movements in the market with long and short side hedging."
"1100750","1106070"," And that will increase as we get closer to the third or the third and the 31st."
"1107590","1112330"," We're going to talk about the JPM caller here in a minute, but I want to express to you that"
"1112330","1118090"," regardless of where we are in the market, that stuff's going to still happen even if we go up. "
"1118090","1123710"," Now, on the side of, let's look at ES real quick, right?"
"1124350","1133850"," You see this move here on ES and even if you're in the most bullish context ever,"
"1134070","1138450"," even if we're in the Christmas rally, that only seems to go up."
"1138450","1144670"," And I hear someone today say, well, my position is burning up here."
"1145350","1155250"," You cannot be taking longs with a move this five day monster move and not expect some risk"
"1155250","1159110"," to sideways, consolidated movement. "
"1160050","1161910"," We had the look above, right?"
"1162050","1166050"," We got our nice look above today and that we're going to get some consolidation."
"1166050","1173070"," And when we get some consolidation for this move higher to this 4800, we're looking for certain"
"1173070","1173430"," things."
"1173430","1180750"," If we're not seeing them, then we're going to continue to sideways movement and possibly slightly"
"1180750","1181190"," down. "
"1181730","1183550"," Now, we're going to take you somewhere else."
"1183690","1184410"," I want to talk to you about this."
"1184710","1186810"," You see how giant this move here is here. "
"1186810","1195250"," I talked in Sunday's video about the real risk for us to trade violently deep into a new correction"
"1195250","1195990"," down here."
"1196850","1199730"," And where does that, why are we open to that?"
"1199990","1207870"," Because when big banks, the biggest five to eight banks, put the rehedge this market, let's say"
"1207870","1212550"," we're expecting them to hedge on the downside to 460 or 450."
"1212550","1213790"," It's not so bad. "
"1214130","1217390"," But let's just say JPM hedged down to 435."
"1218690","1225250"," And we saw some of that early hedging on Monday, we saw someone hedged the spy to 435."
"1226210","1228330"," We had some panic and some small hedge fund. "
"1228770","1233070"," So what if we don't expect that we have to at least be aware that that could happen."
"1233070","1236350"," That can make the market very volatile."
"1237130","1241970"," The other thing that can make the market very volatile when we're in here is all of the hedging"
"1241970","1246030"," that's coming off the market as we head into the third. "
"1246430","1249790"," This is the negative hedging that we had way, way back here."
"1251510","1257770"," So we've got some events that are taking place that will lend some volatility, even if they're"
"1257770","1260470"," brief during this time period."
"1260470","1264170"," So the logic would be, hey, we've come this far here, right?"
"1264590","1266370"," This is already working against us as bulls. "
"1267250","1271390"," We know that there are some market events that are going to take place that are going to be"
"1271390","1272410"," negative down here."
"1272950","1279650"," And then we also know that in these collar strategies that they have some buy side stuff to do."
"1280950","1286330"," So even on the buy side, let's say you're, we talked about this weekend, I talked to you about the"
"1286330","1288010"," billions of dollars in hedging, right?"
"1288410","1288830"," It's billions. "
"1289410","1290770"," You're going to see billions come in."
"1291310","1295150"," And when you see those billions come in, if they're on the buy side, we're going to see some upward"
"1295150","1296090"," movement as well."
"1297310","1303270"," So maybe straddles are your friend here, where you're buying the long side and you just have to"
"1303270","1304770"," wait or time it correctly. "
"1305570","1306090"," Right?"
"1306390","1307330"," Or you're buying a spread."
"1307490","1309650"," We talked about spreads being your friend in this environment."
"1310250","1315530"," You can buy a call spread from now into Friday or into January. "
"1316850","1320270"," So you have to deal with the up and down movements of the market, right?"
"1320550","1321050"," For the expiry."
"1321190","1328970"," You could do a Friday expiry on a call spread that's up here at 480 and you could take some"
"1328970","1332150"," short dated puts for six cents every day along the way."
"1332150","1336510"," So if you don't get your tag up here, I wouldn't say do the 480, but I would say do"
"1336510","1338770"," it in the money call spread, expires on Friday. "
"1339490","1346710"," And then you are hedging with six cents puts every day as we move through to Friday or even Monday"
"1346710","1348130"," or whatever."
"1351050","1356150"," But when we're up here, if you're, if you can only be long up here or only be short up"
"1356150","1358350"," here, if you're like, I'm only a bull or I'm only a bear."
"1359190","1360530"," That's all that works for me. "
"1360830","1362970"," It doesn't really work as a trader or investor."
"1363390","1367610"," It might possibly be better for you to sit this one out into the new year."
"1369350","1370770"," So we've already got this here. "
"1370850","1371730"," We've got this huge move."
"1372290","1376130"," You can't get that greedy and I move this high."
"1376410","1376730"," I got you guys. "
"1376950","1378410"," I got to express this to you."
"1378890","1379050"," Okay."
"1379570","1386190"," And I want to talk to you briefly about not specifically home depot, but when we hit tops, I want"
"1386190","1386970"," to show you guys. "
"1386970","1392910"," I want to show you guys something that that happens when you when you're hitting tops."
"1393110","1393310"," Okay."
"1393550","1395110"," Maybe this might not be the best way to be looking at. "
"1395530","1396810"," Let me bring up some chart."
"1396990","1397810"," I haven't charted."
"1399430","1409310"," I don't think I do SPX anymore, but I want to show you what I want to show you is"
"1409310","1412330"," when when you're, well, let me go. "
"1415190","1417050"," Let's just say that we hit this resistance."
"1417610","1419210"," This this here is resistance."
"1419650","1420670"," This white line is resistance. "
"1420890","1421210"," Okay."
"1421730","1423030"," Doesn't matter where it is."
"1423470","1424030"," It's resistance. "
"1425850","1427050"," This is on any ETF."
"1427770","1429310"," Any chart doesn't matter."
"1429870","1431870"," You come up and you meet major resistance. "
"1432930","1433370"," Okay."
"1433930","1434670"," I want to show you."
"1434790","1435710"," Let's say it's right here. "
"1436310","1436770"," We come up."
"1436890","1444570"," We hit major resistance on a chart."
"1444810","1444930"," Okay. "
"1446570","1452150"," When we come up to this resistance point, this had this major resistance inevitably a call wall."
"1452150","1454110"," We're going to come up to it."
"1455110","1457110"," And we're only going to have certain reactions. "
"1457450","1459250"," We're either going to immediately ricochet off."
"1460790","1463710"," That shows you that it's being rejected, right?"
"1463850","1466750"," This is pretty clear that we rejected this this major resistance."
"1467670","1476630"," We also know that if we hit resistance and we break through that that was a false wall, right?"
"1476850","1478690"," That was that was a weak resistance point. "
"1479270","1486750"," We know that there must have been more calls above that we didn't know about or heavy calls came in"
"1486750","1488510"," farther outside the money."
"1488510","1491510"," And we broke through."
"1492310","1492730"," Right. "
"1492910","1494190"," So that was not a real resistance."
"1494590","1495630"," It was just a minor resistance."
"1496370","1499910"," Now, if we move, come up to this to this call wall up here. "
"1500570","1500690"," Right."
"1500830","1504510"," We know that we don't have a ton of calls above 47 49."
"1505450","1513470"," We see equity flow supply side on the buy side coming in and light call buying above. "
"1513670","1516130"," Let's say it's at 4800 or 4900."
"1516550","1519030"," There'll be time for consolidation in here."
"1519710","1521430"," And that's what's taking place right now. "
"1522750","1523770"," We're consolidating."
"1524530","1530750"," And what there's a few points in this consolidation that you need to understand is that number one,"
"1530750","1534890"," it's giving the time for the market to find its direction here."
"1535170","1537810"," That means the market doesn't know where it wants to go. "
"1538530","1545550"," It means that the market makers and the in the traders in it, the investors in it, are waiting for"
"1545550","1549290"," some news to for the market to decide to decide."
"1549410","1554890"," And that means we're waiting on who the banks to decide where they're going to sell calls, right?"
"1554890","1559250"," Are they going to sell calls at 500 above here, 525, 550?"
"1560190","1565510"," Are they going to buy a bunch of outside the money calls up here as we head into the first"
"1565510","1567550"," of the year for the third of the year, right?"
"1567990","1574850"," So the market's waiting to find out what these moves are going to be made above and these moves are"
"1574850","1575530"," made below."
"1576290","1579130"," And so us as retail traders, we're not making that decision. "
"1580230","1581690"," We don't drive the market."
"1581690","1582490"," The banks do."
"1583470","1585450"," So we're waiting on that to happen. "
"1585670","1586990"," Now, what happens in that timeframe?"
"1589810","1598590"," We can trade the support in the minor support intraday and resistance levels in here while we wait."
"1599350","1608010"," We know that if we wait long enough that this this sideways movement will have a tendency to trade"
"1608010","1611470"," down and then squeeze above again."
"1612290","1618190"," Then sideways trade down and then squeeze above again. "
"1618930","1624530"," Now, the timeframe in this is not as important as the levels."
"1625090","1629590"," So you guys can easily look on the charts that I show you tonight and find the support and"
"1629590","1630390"," resistance levels."
"1630790","1633630"," You can day trade this stuff intraday if you want. "
"1633630","1640670"," If you put spreads on and your core belief is, hey, we're going to 4800, then a spread would do"
"1640670","1642730"," you better with some time on its hands, right?"
"1643530","1648450"," And we also know that what during this time period right now, that there could be moments of"
"1648450","1648790"," weakness."
"1649590","1651610"," There could be moments in here."
"1651610","1659890"," If you were playing, let's say, believe it or not, a Tesla or some, a sensitive stock, like a GME"
"1659890","1662930"," or a PayPal or a pins. "
"1663610","1669230"," You could also end up seeing in here this week severe drawdowns."
"1669230","1675730"," You might see the market be heading up, but your stock is going to have a moment where it falls"
"1675730","1676770"," or collapses."
"1676770","1679370"," And so that was my points behind. "
"1679830","1682370"," You should be hedging during this period."
"1682390","1687570"," When we come up here, even if we're going up, you might have these momentary drawdowns."
"1688070","1694270"," So if you're a bull, maybe you're just cash gang right now and you're waiting hoping that you'll"
"1694270","1696250"," find these brief moments of weakness. "
"1696250","1702330"," I also, and this is specifically related to January."
"1703290","1710650"," The real trade right now, if you're a bull, is to be cash and waiting for these momentary, these"
"1710650","1711470"," moments of weakness."
"1712050","1712610"," Hold on a second here. "
"1715350","1721650"," As a bull, you're really looking for these momentary to be patient, sit on your hands and wait for"
"1721650","1728510"," these moments because you do realize, right?"
"1728510","1734330"," I'm going to say long IWM or I want to long something that's been heavily shorted."
"1734930","1738750"," I'm going to attempt to, let's say I'm trying, let's say I'm like, you know what we're going to do."
"1739390","1741750"," We're going to, we're going to, we're going to pump PayPal up in January. "
"1741990","1744790"," It's been shorted down or snap is a great example."
"1745390","1748290"," We're going to actually, we're going to remove our shorts off snap."
"1749270","1754830"," We're going to take snap long, but I really want better positioning where everyone else is"
"1754830","1756070"," positioned and snap right now. "
"1756070","1760190"," I already hold a ton of snap equities."
"1760630","1763250"," I'm shorting the shit out of snap right now."
"1763670","1766230"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in to snap in the early morning. "
"1766230","1766950"," I'm going to send my guys."
"1767290","1772430"," I'm going to send my boiler room guys down there to the basement on the third."
"1773030","1779050"," And what they're going to do is they're going to heavily sell out of snap at four o'clock in"
"1779050","1780790"," the morning, three o'clock, four o'clock in the morning. "
"1781290","1786110"," And we're going to dump snap at four a.m. We're going to just bury it."
"1786810","1789450"," And the price of snaps going to plummet."
"1790890","1794590"," And I'm going to sell out of my position of snap while I'm still inside my shorts. "
"1794830","1799230"," I'm going to short the hell out of it down until the nine 30 hour."
"1800210","1803870"," Right, you're going to, all the internet's going to be like a bunch of chickens in a head house"
"1803870","1804750"," with the wolves outside."
"1804750","1807510"," You're going to capitulate site positions and snap. "
"1808310","1809510"," And then what am I going to do?"
"1809870","1810930"," I'm going to close my shorts."
"1811750","1815170"," I'm going to buy back all my shares as a bank, right?"
"1815690","1817010"," And then I'm going to load up."
"1817350","1820210"," And how do you perceive that as a as a trader and investor. "
"1820770","1823190"," You see huge capitulation in early morning hours."
"1823350","1828430"," You see this giant red bar dildo bar of snap burning."
"1828430","1833870"," And you think we're all screwed the world's in and then out of no way you see this boom green"
"1833870","1834530"," bar down below. "
"1835790","1840450"," And that right there is a bank buying into snap for a long."
"1840650","1841310"," It could be any stock."
"1841790","1847490"," If they do that operation on let's say Monday or Tuesday of next week or someday this week. "
"1848590","1851510"," You have to be watching for that in the stock market."
"1851510","1856130"," Because then what happens is they'll start accumulating than other banks will start accumulating"
"1856130","1859290"," than small family offices, small hedge funds will start accumulating."
"1860030","1863750"," And before you know it, you'll start seeing it being talked about on CNBC. "
"1865470","1867170"," And it's too late at that point."
"1868990","1869710"," It's too late."
"1870030","1871530"," You can see it in the Home Depot right now. "
"1871570","1872730"," You can see it in the Home Depot trade."
"1873430","1875870"," You can see it right now in the Home Depot trades going on."
"1876450","1879350"," So I want you to be aware of that as we move forward in the stock market. "
"1879350","1886770"," I want you to see that when we come to real resistance, you're expecting three reactions you're"
"1886770","1889570"," expecting, expecting one of three reactions right."
"1890110","1891870"," You're expecting ricochet off."
"1892450","1893270"," That's bearish. "
"1894430","1894670"," Right."
"1895230","1896430"," You're expecting a breakthrough."
"1897210","1897630"," That's bullish. "
"1897910","1898610"," That's super bullish."
"1899250","1900870"," That means nobody knows what the fuck they're doing."
"1901450","1903690"," And then you're waiting for this other one. "
"1903750","1908450"," This is where we bounce off consolidate and we're waiting for the market to pick a direction."
"1909210","1912410"," They'll sometimes look above and peak above and see if we're heading higher."
"1912830","1914570"," If the market says, Nope, we're not ready yet. "
"1914910","1915810"," They're going to check below."
"1916490","1918570"," If the market says, Nope, we're not ready yet."
"1918690","1921450"," We're going to come back up, consolidate until we find a way. "
"1921730","1922570"," Let's say a peak below."
"1923030","1928370"," You can't get bearish unless we peek below and the market says, Yep, we're not going any higher"
"1928370","1928610"," here."
"1928750","1929870"," We don't know what's going on. "
"1930550","1932190"," I've got some news that nobody else knows."
"1932330","1933510"," We're going to start selling this down."
"1933810","1935570"," That's when you start to get bearish down here. "
"1936210","1936770"," Okay."
"1939810","1941550"," Does that all make sense so far?"
"1941830","1942870"," Everybody understanding that?"
"1945430","1948630"," So I want you guys to understand how this happens when we come through resistance."
"1949230","1952770"," This works the same on on inverses. "
"1952950","1955830"," This works the same if you're a bear on the inverse."
"1957130","1958870"," When you're coming into major supports."
"1960270","1962330"," You're looking for these things to happen. "
"1962330","1965610"," We had an event on that believe in the 10th."
"1966170","1970470"," Where we're in a low liquidity environment and we broke through known support."
"1971170","1974010"," The same thing happens all the time in single tickers. "
"1974330","1983370"," This is what I was afraid of on Monday into Tuesday on spy or es or spy."
"1984190","1985670"," We could look at spy over here."
"1988690","1989430"," My fear. "
"1990250","1996190"," Right here on Monday was that we would go up and after hours in the overnight globe accession."
"1996350","2001670"," When the quinity was low and we'd sell and burn the market down with at least down to maybe like"
"2001670","2001950"," 460."
"2002710","2008490"," So that's why I put that hedge on I was afraid of the manipulation that can take place within these"
"2008490","2009170"," hours here. "
"2009310","2013190"," We were too close for my taste into what would happen into Monday."
"2014010","2014310"," Okay."
"2014310","2016330"," And we're up in after hours. "
"2016450","2019510"," We went up and after hours and we went up into."
"2020870","2023390"," Globex this evening right in the overnight hours."
"2023450","2025610"," So what we could wind up seeing in spy. "
"2027880","2029720"," Is let's say we end up."
"2031260","2032760"," Checking this every day."
"2033080","2036060"," So let's say we open this tomorrow and up here. "
"2036360","2036840"," Right."
"2036980","2038460"," Then we bounce back down in here."
"2038840","2040100"," We bought we do this job. "
"2040300","2040420"," Right."
"2041740","2043080"," We just start bouncing around."
"2043560","2044860"," So how do you trade that. "
"2045740","2048820"," The way that you trade that if you want to continue to trade the spy."
"2049500","2054940"," I want to trade this by as you're looking for supports right you're looking for supports at 47566."
"2055560","2057179"," You're looking for supports of 474. "
"2057980","2066100"," You know that if we break below 4700 somewhere in here it's between this for this probably needs to"
"2066100","2066520"," be raised."
"2067260","2070080"," Because it's moving up believe it or not."
"2070080","2072960"," When I say this is your by the fucking dip moment down here. "
"2073760","2074920"," That this is it right here."
"2075480","2077179"," Like this is you could trade just this."
"2077780","2082900"," You could just say it might not ever come down here but if you said I'm going to sell 4780. "
"2084060","2089820"," And I'm going to buy 4700 or 471 your own risk appetite down here."
"2090100","2092520"," You could successfully trade this no problem."
"2093380","2093540"," Okay. "
"2093540","2098880"," So you're selling the tops behind the bottoms and you're looking for weakness and forms of unknown"
"2098880","2099360"," news."
"2099840","2103180"," You're looking for weakness and forms of hedging being placed in the markets."
"2103900","2106040"," And as we get closer to the 31st. "
"2106540","2113060"," You know that the likelihood of us having some weakness and some reps are high."
"2113440","2119160"," You know as we get closer to Friday that we're more than likely going to have a rip higher."
"2119160","2125180"," We're probably at some point before Friday hit 48 48 25 on ES. "
"2126600","2131480"," It could take until Monday but probably will happen before Friday."
"2131780","2136320"," We think that JPM has to buy do a buy side in this market."
"2136720","2138740"," We've talked about us hitting 4800 by Friday. "
"2138740","2144400"," And then I've also talked to you in the past videos to expect some sort of move or or or"
"2144400","2147640"," volatility and weakness in the market."
"2147640","2151640"," Probably sometime on Friday into Monday morning."
"2152880","2155220"," I mean, let's look at this perspective. "
"2155780","2163230"," Let's look at the perspective of let's look at let's say we do this here, right?"
"2172090","2175510"," Let's talk about how do you get shaken out of this market, right?"
"2175890","2176430"," You trade up."
"2176470","2177030"," You trade down."
"2179400","2180540"," Let's say you trade up here. "
"2180580","2181180"," You trade down."
"2181320","2182080"," You trade up here."
"2182740","2184840"," And let's say you have one day where you trade down. "
"2185260","2186400"," This is the 31st, right?"
"2187160","2187900"," That's the 30th."
"2188340","2190980"," Let's say we trade until we trade way higher to the 30th."
"2191240","2192540"," It's like 12 o'clock in the afternoon. "
"2192980","2194660"," You're all pumped for at 48 25."
"2195220","2196000"," Everything is great."
"2196360","2197640"," You can close out your spreads. "
"2198080","2206660"," Let's say we trade down to this on the third, right?"
"2206840","2208160"," So it's all comes down to timing."
"2208940","2213360"," When when if you were a bully, you could have just waited till we were down here at this 4600"
"2213360","2213620"," mark."
"2214040","2216260"," If you're a bear, you might get trapped down here. "
"2216480","2218160"," You might think this is the great doom."
"2218160","2223560"," And yet it just opens us up to a larger move in January."
"2225970","2226810"," You see that?"
"2227110","2228890"," You see how you're buying bottoms?"
"2229270","2233530"," You're selling tops and you're looking for that one ripper to the top. "
"2233850","2238450"," If you can't time this stuff, then what you're doing is trying to buy a spread down here somewhere."
"2238990","2242250"," And hopefully you're able to close it out on Friday or Monday."
"2242930","2248550"," And then if you're really looking to take longs in that ER trade, there's more than likely going to"
"2248550","2249930"," be an opportunity at some point. "
"2250210","2252610"," 31st, the 1st, the 3rd, somewhere down in here."
"2253450","2253570"," Okay."
"2254150","2258650"," And what's my next point on me throwing that that a straddle on?"
"2259190","2263750"," More than likely I'm going to catch that straddle long here before Wednesday. "
"2264110","2267830"," I'll let's say I'm long and well right now I'm long into the 29th and tomorrow."
"2268470","2272030"," So I'm going to take a risk that we're going up to 4800 tomorrow."
"2272030","2277270"," If those burn, I'll take them again for the 31st expiry dirt cheap. "
"2278390","2284610"," And right now I've got us and right now I've got a hedge on expiring on the 3rd."
"2285150","2291090"," Because I still in my belief think we're heading down between now and the 3rd as well."
"2291550","2298810"," So between those two long trades and this one short trade, I should be able to capture both both"
"2298810","2299910"," trades in this market. "
"2300170","2301670"," Does that make sense to everybody out there?"
"2301670","2309120"," Let me explain it to you."
"2310100","2314040"," JPM is implied to have to buy a hedge."
"2315820","2317980"," $12 billion is coming into the market. "
"2319180","2320180"," $12 billion."
"2320900","2324860"," So it either begins on Thursday or ultimately Friday."
"2325860","2326500"," Does that make sense?"
"2327400","2330420"," As the hedges roll off, when do they roll off?"
"2331140","2334000"," They roll off on the 31st at the end of the day. "
"2334720","2335980"," Does that make sense?"
"2336600","2340620"," So you've got two large forces in the market."
"2340860","2343600"," You will see, I'm going to make you a bet."
"2344900","2346240"," What will I bet you?"
"2346920","2353060"," What can I do to prove to you that you'll see a swing higher and a swing lower?"
"2354120","2361960"," I want to cut my hair off or something to show you the chances of a swing high and a"
"2361960","2362400"," swing low. "
"2362400","2363960"," I don't know what to do."
"2364240","2369920"," What can I do to prove to you guys how likely the chance of that is?"
"2370520","2372520"," Because that is what we're at right now."
"2374980","2377080"," So you could take just one side. "
"2377080","2380400"," If you're a bear and you're like, well, I only like this downside over here."
"2380800","2383940"," We've talked about putting on a put spread, right?"
"2384740","2386440"," I like the idea of a put spread."
"2387300","2389420"," JP Morgan writes the idea of a put spread. "
"2389940","2394060"," That's more than likely what they're doing because they're putting on a put spread."
"2394520","2400540"," They're more than likely going to take some calls above it, 500, 525, 550."
"2401060","2407260"," Some other banks will follow suit about a four loco. "
"2407500","2409280"," Oh my, that is nasty."
"2411710","2413090"," I don't want to cut off my beautiful hair."
"2416250","2416470"," Okay. "
"2416670","2419770"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to, how about this?"
"2419770","2425650"," Yes, if we don't swing high in swing low, I'll drink a four loco."
"2425750","2426230"," I'll find one."
"2426330","2431230"," I'll go down to the, to the local shitty gas station and find some four loco. "
"2431850","2436310"," And I'll drink one because if it seems, I don't even know if they're available anymore, but I'll"
"2436310","2438750"," drink one of those because that sounds absolutely disgusting."
"2439950","2443190"," And I'll do that if we don't, if we don't have something like this happen."
"2444170","2449550"," Now, if you don't agree with this theory as to what's going to happen in the market, I would"
"2449550","2450690"," recommend that you don't trade. "
"2451370","2451910"," Okay."
"2452130","2453810"," I'll mark my words in this video."
"2454350","2454910"," Don't trade. "
"2456090","2460710"," Now, if you're training individual tickers in this area here, there is some danger."
"2461230","2465370"," If it's being, if you're, if your tickers being hedged, you could see some volatility in your"
"2465370","2467410"," tickers, even if they want, wind up going up."
"2467910","2473250"," I would expect less volatility in, in the bank favorite stocks. "
"2473250","2479250"," I'd expect less volatility in the AMD's and the Amazon's and the Misfits and the Googles."
"2479410","2481790"," You might find some weakness, but not volatility."
"2482390","2484570"," There is some real great chances. "
"2486170","2492690"," If you were to monitor, let's say the reopening or not the reopening, the beaten down tech trade,"
"2493290","2498470"," you would probably open up, I think in a lot of your brokerages, I think even in, in Webull, you"
"2498470","2500410"," can open up like five or six tickers."
"2500410","2506210"," If you were to just monitor five or six beaten down tickers that you believe are going to come back"
"2506210","2513270"," in January, you would be looking for that moment of weakness where hedges are coming off and then a"
"2513270","2514590"," bid into those stocks."
"2515130","2517290"," And maybe you go your own way heading into the beginning of the year. "
"2520920","2522860"," Oh, Mad Bob, Mad Dog 2020."
"2522860","2523880"," That is so nasty."
"2524780","2525720"," Shave my eyebrows. "
"2526620","2533160"," You know what I'll do?"
"2534180","2535800"," Malibu is most wanted or something."
"2536340","2537840"," That would look absolutely terrible."
"2538660","2540740"," Or I'll cut some steps in the side of my head. "
"2541180","2542080"," I don't know if I can do that."
"2543400","2545740"," But this is some form of a likely scenario."
"2547220","2552900"," And if you see the bid command, the reason you've got likely above and below is because if you"
"2552900","2559100"," start to see these banks put calls on that are outside the money, that will be the trigger for us"
"2559100","2559720"," to go higher. "
"2559720","2560500"," Okay."
"2560980","2569000"," And if you see the banks raise, if you see the gamma, if you see the hedging falling off and"
"2569000","2574400"," higher hedging being brought into the market, you'll see weakness in that hedging falling off down"
"2574400","2574640"," here."
"2575300","2575620"," Okay. "
"2576480","2579720"," So you've got a lot of mechanics in play right now in the markets."
"2580220","2583300"," You've got all these cogs and wheels turning in the market right now."
"2583680","2584700"," It's very complex. "
"2584700","2590400"," And my points behind the title card of this wasn't the title card."
"2590440","2594000"," I meant to do like a bully title card is think of it."
"2594260","2600480"," Think of the market right now is like, there's a four or five bullies in the hallway at your school"
"2600480","2605340"," and or your or classes let out and you're the new kid in school. "
"2605600","2611360"," You've got all these upperclassmen and they're just walking by you and you're getting rough house"
"2611360","2615020"," and pushed around as the big boys are making their moves."
"2615740","2617660"," So you don't want to be rough houses around."
"2618220","2622120"," You want to understand and accept that this is what they're doing. "
"2622960","2627560"," And then you want to position yourself for each side of that trade."
"2628700","2633780"," You can't trade the next three days and into Monday just like normal trading."
"2634000","2640600"," You have to look at this from the perspective of the banks and say, okay, if I'm going for us"
"2640600","2647680"," to actually get up to 48 80 or break below 4700, if I want, if I'm going to be bearish,"
"2648080","2651580"," if I'm a day trader, I'm going to be buying the dips and selling the rips. "
"2652600","2652880"," Right."
"2653340","2654700"," You know where the dips are."
"2654860","2657980"," I'm going to show them to you right now on the on the other charts. "
"2658780","2664080"," And you know where the seller rips rip is up here unless you start to hear chatter on social media"
"2664080","2666080"," saying, Hey, this is coming in."
"2666300","2667540"," Hey, these hedges are done."
"2667900","2668960"," Hey, we just had a five. "
"2668960","2669940"," We just had a lot."
"2670120","2676620"," So if you have 11, 12 billion dollars, 15 billion dollars on a buy side, 20 billion dollars on a"
"2676620","2681420"," buy side, you guys think we're going down on a 20 billion dollar buy side in the morning of"
"2681420","2682280"," Thursday or Friday."
"2683760","2688500"," You guys think we're going down that day on the buy side, 20 billion dollars. "
"2689560","2690400"," That happened."
"2691660","2691920"," Okay."
"2692920","2694860"," You might see weakness in futures. "
"2696000","2698980"," Dealers selling futures, but you're not going to see it in cash market."
"2699660","2703240"," So I want you to be conscious of this, these moves as we move forward."
"2703680","2705540"," And if you're like, Hey, this is too much for me. "
"2705900","2706520"," I need a break."
"2706880","2708740"," We had all this time to make money over here."
"2709080","2712280"," There's no need to have to make money in these next two, three days. "
"2712920","2716500"," So if you are, you want to trade the ER season."
"2717640","2722100"," You guys know that when we are going to season, there's always that one moments of weakness,"
"2722640","2723800"," sometimes even two."
"2723800","2730800"," If you know that if tickers go straight vertical into ER season, that they always sell the news"
"2730800","2731980"," prior to ER. "
"2733000","2737900"," And I know there's Tesla bulls out there that say, well, the last five years, we've always gone up"
"2737900","2740580"," at least three of the last five years or four of the last five years."
"2740580","2741360"," I don't want to miss that."
"2741700","2742740"," You don't have to miss it. "
"2743360","2749100"," What you can do is you just buy a call spread on Tesla with your price target for ER, right?"
"2749460","2752720"," You don't have to worry about any violent moves down in here."
"2752720","2755260"," And you can actually hedge the market as well."
"2755860","2756440"," Okay. "
"2760720","2762260"," Gap up isn't likely."
"2765310","2774330"," There is most definitely between now and the 31st, a melt up day to 480."
"2775230","2777430"," There is a high chance of it. "
"2778130","2780510"," An absolute high chance of a move up."
"2781190","2786250"," Because there's no one out there that knows what the hedging is going to compose."
"2786870","2793270"," Everyone thinks right now that the banks are going to be selling calls and in reality, we think"
"2793270","2794090"," they're going to be buying. "
"2796940","2802640"," Sit, wait for the drop and go in to go up."
"2803200","2803440"," Okay."
"2803820","2804020"," Yeah. "
"2804120","2809580"," So you guys can make your decisions as to what you think's going to happen for myself, right?"
"2809760","2812540"," From my trading plan, I believe that we go higher."
"2813280","2816800"," We are going up to 48, 25 between now and Friday."
"2816800","2823020"," I have my calls in place for that move between now and Friday that absurd melt up into the Friday"
"2823020","2823340"," clothes. "
"2823940","2830500"," And then I've got a hedge for expiring on Monday for some form of a sell off into the third."
"2830960","2833160"," They should both sides should print no problem for me."
"2833560","2836120"," I don't think I have much of an issue in both of these trades here. "
"2836680","2842440"," But most of you out there, if you're getting chewed up in here, there's no shame in just waiting"
"2842440","2844060"," for the trade to come to you."
"2844620","2845440"," There's no shit."
"2845580","2849780"," We just made this giant move up here, five straight days of relentless up. "
"2850160","2854340"," If you didn't make your money in this trade here, then I don't know what else to say to you."
"2854840","2860220"," And if you are uber bullish up here and think we're going higher than 48, 25, which I don't think"
"2860220","2860700"," that we are."
"2861020","2865800"," I think we're going up to like 4800 on spy and 48, 25 on ES. "
"2866540","2871440"," But I think if that if we're going up here or if we melt up here into Friday, there still"
"2871440","2875420"," should be some force form of a relief rally down below."
"2875960","2882120"," I want you to know that to 4,700 right here at 4,700 is still all bullish context."
"2882920","2887220"," You start to enter volatility between 4,700 and 4,600. "
"2888380","2891220"," And we're not even bearish until we break below 4,600."
"2894310","2894450"," Okay."
"2895070","2895410"," All right. "
"2895750","2898330"," So let's go through the charts real quick for tomorrow."
"2899110","2906840"," I just want to show you some levels and we're just going to take a quick look."
"2907020","2909700"," You can apply these to your trading day. "
"2912390","2914430"," I want you guys to see these as you trade."
"2916740","2918350"," These levels move intraday."
"2919340","2921240"," They should move though. "
"2921380","2928320"," They should greatly expand and contract over the next week due to negative gamma falling off the"
"2928320","2930820"," market from way back here."
"2930820","2935890"," I'll show you where I'm talking about here."
"2942610","2943230"," Right here. "
"2943990","2944510"," Okay."
"2945070","2945270"," Somewhere."
"2945450","2946150"," Somewhere in here. "
"2946410","2947070"," Right in here."
"2947770","2949490"," We had negative gamma come into the market."
"2950070","2952770"," We had further negative gamma come into the market down here. "
"2953230","2957190"," And we also had negative gamma come in for protection much lower below down here."
"2957670","2960570"," That stuff is rolling off as we move into the 31st."
"2960830","2965470"," It's one of the largest gamma expirations we've had in the history of the stock market. "
"2965470","2969490"," There could be some weakness associated with that into into the third."
"2970270","2970750"," Okay."
"2970910","2972030"," I want to be a conscience of that. "
"2972350","2976150"," And then we also have to be concerned about where the banks are hedging."
"2976430","2981550"," If they're buying or selling their hedge, the implication right now is that they're going to be"
"2981550","2983270"," buying this edge and not selling it."
"2985320","2992140"," If you want to know where your by the tip levels are, they're down below here at 4714 46 990. "
"2992920","2996440"," These numbers are slightly different in in cash markets."
"2996980","3000920"," My self I'll be trading down below here looking for these bought these dip buys."
"3001380","3003760"," I think I put these out here for you today, right?"
"3005280","3012700"," You've got dip buys down below 47 37 47 56 47 67 47 80. "
"3013020","3017380"," And then we're looking to have to meet resistance above at 47 89."
"3018140","3020740"," Ultimately 48 hundred and 48 25."
"3021460","3021780"," Okay. "
"3021780","3026160"," So if you're if you're if you're like, hey, I'm losing money here, then you know where the sell the"
"3026160","3028480"," rip and then buy the dip zones are on this chart."
"3028980","3029460"," Okay."
"3029780","3031720"," You know where the volatility trigger is. "
"3031920","3033300"," That's at 46 33."
"3033840","3038860"," The negative gamma flip is down below between four six zero six and four five eight eight."
"3039240","3043680"," I'm going to show you the the the RT Y chart. "
"3046360","3050130"," I'm really interested in this one because you've got major gamma gamma coming off here."
"3050510","3053630"," You saw the rejection of this is all volatility up here."
"3054190","3056290"," And this is all volatility down here, right?"
"3056810","3060470"," You saw the nice clean rejection today on IWM. "
"3060890","3063550"," You should be looking for some consolidation in this area."
"3064050","3065730"," You'll be looking for something like this."
"3068850","3075170"," Some form of consolidation in here with the hedging, let's say, falling off into the into the new"
"3075170","3077050"," year and then a rocket ship up. "
"3077050","3078390"," This is the trade that I'm making."
"3079650","3086150"," If we if we break through and we don't get that weakness, I'm, I'm actually going to make this"
"3086150","3086750"," trade here."
"3086750","3092130"," If it fails, I'm looking to buy the dip down here into the new year and take this much higher. "
"3092370","3096810"," That's my trading plan is we are in a positive context right now on the Russell."
"3097210","3101070"," Remember not to day trade the Russell until we break above two 28."
"3101070","3106930"," If you are not break day trading the Russell, you should be trading on spreads or one to three"
"3106930","3108510"," month out calls or puts. "
"3108910","3113690"," If you're bearish on the Russell right now, you should still be trading on a one to three month"
"3113690","3118130"," output or a one to three month output spread of some, some sort."
"3118810","3123070"," I would also recommend if you're taking credit spreads, let's say on the spy or ES."
"3123070","3131230"," Not ES, but the spy, you would do much better with debit debit, debit put spreads on the Russell"
"3131230","3133610"," because the directional moves are much slower. "
"3134030","3137130"," It's a less liquid market than the spy or ES."
"3137970","3140630"," So be conscious of that as you trade ES."
"3141230","3142930"," Next, we're going to look at the cues. "
"3148870","3149570"," And this is the holidays."
"3150390","3153910"," You guys can, some of these trades, you guys can set them and forget them."
"3154250","3156550"," You don't have to actively be trading them all day long. "
"3156550","3161490"," If you put a spread on, you can just walk away and come back and check on it and feel"
"3161490","3162070"," good about it."
"3163050","3168230"," Matter of fact, this whole week, I felt much more confident placing a trade and just walking away"
"3168230","3171110"," from it and letting and watching to see what happens in that trade."
"3172690","3173210"," All right. "
"3173210","3176970"," Same thing on the on the on the cues."
"3177670","3179150"," We had we had a wait a minute here."
"3183790","3186270"," I haven't changed these charts from Sunday night. "
"3186650","3188790"," These are all the same charts from Sunday night."
"3191070","3192410"," We made this move up."
"3192730","3193010"," We tagged. "
"3193510","3195850"," This was a Sunday into Monday, right?"
"3196530","3200310"," Today was, excuse me, this was today the 28th."
"3200590","3202850"," We tagged above, became below."
"3203530","3204890"," We hit some form of support. "
"3205570","3206630"," What are we expecting in here?"
"3206770","3212130"," We're going to be expecting consolidation in here."
"3212790","3216490"," And the banks to either say, Hey, yeah, we're going up."
"3217530","3220390"," Or the banks to say, no, no, wait a minute. "
"3220390","3223010"," I think that I'm afraid you got."
"3224450","3226430"," Some of the dozen like Tom Lee."
"3227910","3229050"," That says, you know what?"
"3229190","3230550"," I actually think we're going down. "
"3231670","3236190"," So we're going to buy a whole bunch of put protection way, way, way, way down at 13, at 13 "
"3236190","3237110",",000 or something."
"3237410","3241270"," And then you'll see the market do something like this in a, in a, in a shot down."
"3241890","3242250"," Okay. "
"3243350","3247410"," You'll see that weakness and then you'll see us actually trade higher over time."
"3247410","3252410"," And then we'll encounter a larger volatility closer to March of 2022."
"3253090","3259330"," You actually see the sell down and you then you'd see us trade higher into January, February, and"
"3259330","3264130"," then you'd see a March sell down to come back for those, those, that, those negative hedges. "
"3268150","3269390"," Gamma coming off me."
"3269750","3270570"," Gamma comes coming."
"3270990","3273010"," Gamma coming up coming off. "
"3274130","3275090"," Can mean."
"3276610","3278650"," Small moments of down."
"3278650","3286410"," And then you have to have to add into what is coming on into the market. "
"3286910","3290450"," So let's say we have a, we have a negative gamma hedge that's rolling off and we have a moment"
"3290450","3290810"," of weakness."
"3291110","3293810"," We're also going to have an inverse moment of strength."
"3294090","3298970"," And then you have to consider what their, what these banks are buying or selling into their next"
"3298970","3299330"," hedge. "
"3300510","3303450"," And right now the thought process is that they're buying."
"3303810","3305410"," So that's my point behind."
"3305410","3308370"," You should be expecting a move higher and a move lower. "
"3313110","3314310"," The last day of year."
"3315150","3318630"," You do have that implication as well as well, Denny."
"3318870","3322430"," You do have tax loss harvesting, which is a negative on the markets. "
"3323830","3324810"," That is a good point."
"3324950","3332100"," And I didn't bring it up to this video, but you have a large negative, negative gamma roll off"
"3332100","3332600"," coming off."
"3332620","3337420"," You've got smarter guys than me out there that are saying that you should expect some volatility. "
"3337960","3339440"," You should expect some weakness."
"3339440","3343340"," You can't time these things in previous opexes."
"3343620","3348700"," You'll see that most of these banks, sometimes they really fuck up how they, how they place these"
"3348700","3348980"," trades. "
"3349540","3355260"," They try to be, they try to be sneaky and when they try to trade them so that it doesn't"
"3355260","3356060"," hurt the market."
"3356600","3357960"," It doesn't impact so much."
"3357960","3359800"," They try to break them up and make them quiet. "
"3360520","3362940"," Well, they try to keep them quiet so they're not impacting the market."
"3363460","3365060"," So you should expect volatility."
"3365660","3368140"," You should expect though a move higher as well. "
"3368140","3372820"," You should plan your trades around these things taking place regardless."
"3373560","3380320"," When you guys hear about in the past, when you hear things like the Santa Rally, they're telling"
"3380320","3381800"," you that we will grind up."
"3382040","3388860"," When you have a trader telling you there's no way that we're going to 4800 or 4825, then that"
"3388860","3394380"," trader is telling you that historically we don't melt up. "
"3394380","3402000"," But that's false because we do historically melt up in previous years."
"3402800","3404140"," 80% of the time."
"3404560","3407580"," So for you to say, well, we're never going to see 4800. "
"3408240","3409480"," It's possibly won't see it."
"3409760","3415180"," But there is an 80% chance from where we are right now that we are going to see it."
"3415480","3417340"," We will see a melt up to that number. "
"3417820","3424560"," And even in those great years, there's a 70, 80% chance that you'll see a moment of climate."
"3424900","3429280"," No, because the banks will try to hide when they place these trades."
"3429760","3431100"," But we can prepare for it. "
"3431360","3432540"," We can say I'm going to buy the dips."
"3433120","3437380"," I know that as time runs out, there's a higher chance of us melting up to 4800."
"3437680","3443600"," I know that if I see news out there that JPM has placed their trades, that GS has placed their"
"3443600","3446520"," trades, they'll probably get some weakness in one of these overnights. "
"3447380","3448160"," Does that make sense?"
"3458380","3458820"," Yep."
"3458820","3458940"," Yep."
"3459800","3463440"," And you will have weakness from that tax loss harvesting trade. "
"3463960","3464860"," There will be some weakness."
"3465400","3467660"," But let's see, you've got the tax loss harvesting trade ground."
"3467840","3468760"," Then you've got all this other stuff. "
"3469200","3475480"," You've got all this interest from retail and banks to place the ER trade."
"3477280","3480600"," These are traders that are like, I don't care if we have a good ER or not."
"3480860","3482580"," I just know that everybody's going to be trading Tesla. "
"3483020","3486640"," I just know that everybody's going to be coming in the bottom of my apple for the ER trade."
"3486800","3487460"," I already know that."
"3487460","3492620"," So I don't care where we are because once that interest and sweet premium kicks in, I just want in. "
"3493140","3493480"," Okay."
"3494040","3496560"," So you've got all those dynamics in the market right now."
"3496560","3500360"," These next three to four days, a lot of complicated stuff is going on in the market. "
"3500740","3502240"," And I try to simplify it."
"3502360","3505000"," I think your best bet is to do the straddle."
"3505340","3509080"," Now you get some form of a straddle on the short term at least where you're like, okay, I'm going"
"3509080","3509780"," to trade this up. "
"3510260","3516620"," My price target is bullish to 4800 or 480 or 4825."
"3518100","3523520"," I'm going to take a buy dip for that that expires before the end of the year, or I'm going"
"3523520","3526220"," to buy a call spread that expires on Friday."
"3527200","3528360"," That's just in the money. "
"3528600","3532640"," If you know we're pinned right now and you buy slightly inside the money call, you have a fair"
"3532640","3534520"," chance of closing that thing out for some profit."
"3536360","3538520"," You have a fair chance of closing something like that out."
"3540300","3543900"," But I wouldn't close it out end of day on Friday because I'm thinking that in a day in Friday,"
"3543900","3546320"," we're going to start selling down into that Monday. "
"3547100","3549080"," But there's some strategies that you can take."
"3549080","3554180"," You can take a long call structure into the end of January, or you could just wait and be like,"
"3554280","3554520"," you know what?"
"3554540","3557080"," I'm going to wait for the weakness in the market and I'll take along then."
"3557580","3560460"," You don't have to trade the next few days. "
"3560700","3561980"," You can miss this trade."
"3562640","3564300"," You don't have to win every single trade."
"3564940","3569860"," And sometimes it's better if you don't take on risk right now and wait for your next perfect"
"3569860","3570360"," opportunity. "
"3570360","3576040"," If you go back to my video series in the beginning, I've told you guys, if you had just placed"
"3576040","3581300"," nine or 12 trades on the bull side and nine or 12 trades on the bear side, you'd be a"
"3581300","3582860"," perfect trader every time."
"3588560","3588920"," Yep."
"3589320","3591980"," The velocity means 7% in five days is no joke. "
"3592380","3593380"," But we can go 10%."
"3594020","3595380"," We have gone 9%."
"3595960","3597560"," We've gone 11% 12%. "
"3598400","3599720"," So it's possible."
"3600480","3603540"," And let's say we go up this 11, 12% and we actually go down."
"3603540","3606280"," You know, this next swing down, we'll show you guys this on. "
"3606400","3606620"," Yes."
"3607600","3609340"," This is a tail risk, right?"
"3609680","3612680"," I posted on my main Twitter or my way, my main Twitter feed."
"3613160","3616800"," I posted a video from the net from NASDAQ, right?"
"3618480","3627700"," I talked about tail risk and there are tail risk traders out there, hedge traders that trade on the"
"3627700","3629520"," potential of us trading down. "
"3629520","3634120"," But let's say by March at 438, 429."
"3634840","3641020"," These are people that want directed hedging from right now into end of March."
"3641440","3644840"," So how do you directly hedge an event that can't happen?"
"3645500","3650060"," You buy way outside the money calls down or puts down here. "
"3650820","3657020"," I'd call it 425 expiring in March that this event is now possible."
"3658400","3659680"," Way, way, way, way deeper."
"3661080","3661980"," Hey, little big bear. "
"3666360","3667440"," So, yeah."
"3667780","3668760"," So, and this is on the table."
"3669160","3673700"," If you're a real bear out there, I wouldn't blink if we came down and trade it down to 40. "
"3674820","3676440"," I want you all to know, I wouldn't blink."
"3679110","3684470"," If this weekend, heading in this weekend, we find out that the real big banks think we're heading"
"3684470","3684950"," down here."
"3684950","3690110"," I wouldn't shock me to see us trade down to 4,250, 395. "
"3692850","3696230"," What do you buy hedges down here or do you buy hedges up here?"
"3697770","3701890"," Do you buy your put spreads up here or do you buy your put spreads down here?"
"3702250","3706550"," You guys already know that the Fed, I mean, they haven't taken their foot off the gas, but you know"
"3706550","3707810"," they're going to take their foot off the gas."
"3708490","3709410"," You know they are."
"3709850","3713290"," What if the Fed comes back New Year and says you had your holiday rally?"
"3714170","3716530"," You guys can all piss off. "
"3718190","3723270"," We just, we, now we accelerated the tapering and by the way, we're putting four rate hikes in in"
"3723270","3725030"," January in 2022."
"3726630","3731490"," If they said that's you in January, we'd sell down to four because we didn't expect all that."
"3731670","3731690"," Right?"
"3734630","3735210"," Hey, Andy. "
"3739480","3741640"," So, don't, don't say that it can't happen."
"3741780","3745760"," Don't say, you know, don't be absolutes in your, in your viewpoints."
"3745760","3749880"," When we are at resistance, it's time for you to put hedging on. "
"3750820","3754440"," I like the trade of us melting up into the end of the year here."
"3755040","3760020"," And then I like some volatility for the ER trade in the beginning of January over here."
"3760600","3765960"," I'm going to give that trade right now the best possible. "
"3766340","3768160"," This is, this is the most likely trade."
"3769680","3770180"," Okay."
"3770180","3772420"," So plan accordingly as we move forward. "
"3772920","3778040"," If you guys are getting ground to bits, or if today you were ground to bits, just take a breather."
"3778640","3779560"," Say, you know what I'm going to do?"
"3780100","3780960"," I'm going to sit back."
"3781500","3783200"," It's easier to look at it on the spot. "
"3785900","3789660"," You just sit back, take it easy, drink an eggnog with some rum in it."
"3790440","3791760"," You sell the rips above."
"3792760","3800480"," You buy the dips below until a decision is made by the banks to what their hedges are and the"
"3800480","3802860"," gamma rolls off in the 31st. "
"3803480","3803900"," Okay."
"3807550","3809270"," Does that make sense everybody out there?"
"3809890","3814230"," Talk to you guys about the earlier in the broadcast."
"3814470","3818510"," I talked to you guys about setting up a discord for trades. "
"3819470","3822410"," Pay attention to the flow that we're posting."
"3823010","3826970"," I think I'm going to stay on what I'll do is I'll do a live stream tomorrow, but I'm not"
"3826970","3827750"," going to talk on it."
"3828150","3833330"," I'm going to focus more on where the action is in the market. "
"3833330","3838690"," If they're on single tickers, what I'll do is I'll try to track where the where the money flow is"
"3838690","3846550"," tomorrow, and I will switch the live feed live stream to those tickers specifically, so we can see"
"3846550","3848930"," if we can make some money on individual tickers."
"3850470","3852590"," I mean, we'll start the day on ES."
"3853370","3855050"," I know you got some of you guys are long ES. "
"3857420","3860700"," You can bring this down to a five day here, right?"
"3862520","3865560"," You had to buy the dip situation down below today."
"3866120","3867300"," You had the South of the rip here."
"3868240","3870800"," You know, bulls are going to be looking to sell the rip above here. "
"3871600","3874880"," We're going to want to buy the dippers down here and down here."
"3875020","3877000"," This is your this is your risk profile."
"3877480","3879420"," How much risk do I want to put on?"
"3879720","3880760"," I want to put on all the risk. "
"3881140","3882480"," I don't want to put on much risk."
"3882980","3885880"," I'm going to wait and be patient for down here."
"3886580","3886940"," Right?"
"3890280","3891900"," Bullish bias one foot out the door. "
"3891900","3899580"," You know that if you're a bull up here, you can probably take a bull or excuse me, a bear"
"3899580","3903360"," put spread for end of March March 18 in the money."
"3903820","3904820"," It'll probably print."
"3905420","3908440"," You're probably going to print off that probably guaranteed 100% print. "
"3909660","3915040"," If you want to be more conservative in place in that bet, believe in me telling you were probably"
"3915040","3916720"," more than likely going to touch 4800."
"3917160","3922260"," When we get up here at 4800, that's when you buy your your put spread that expires in March."
"3923120","3923400"," Okay. "
"3927730","3929090"," Let's talk about the Tesla trade."
"3930310","3931390"," We'll bring up Tesla."
"3932530","3933510"," You guys want to see Tesla?"
"3936160","3937720"," You guys want to see my viewpoint on Tesla?"
"3945850","3948210"," So this is the consolidation game, right?"
"3953450","3955910"," We're going to talk about the consolidation game on Tesla. "
"3962420","3964180"," You guys want to know what the bears are doing?"
"3965840","3966960"," What's that the bears are doing?"
"3967580","3968680"," The bears are actually bulls."
"3969260","3969700"," They're not bears."
"3975420","3984940"," So right here, these are trap bulls, trapped bulls, trapped bulls, trapped bulls, hard resistance"
"3984940","3987500"," we broke through, right?"
"3987680","3995380"," So I'd expect, we always talk about this, right?"
"3996060","3997400"," You guys see me chart stuff out?"
"3997500","3998140"," What are you looking for?"
"3998620","4002540"," You're looking for consolidation, right?"
"4003580","4006620"," And either a break below or a break above, right?"
"4008180","4012120"," Consolidation as we head into ER, right?"
"4012700","4013920"," Break above, right?"
"4014440","4016980"," Consolidation, possibly a moment of weakness. "
"4018440","4019940"," And then I move higher, right?"
"4023610","4026490"," Now, let's say you have market conditions in here."
"4028230","4031210"," This is my, this is what I'm looking for heading into ER."
"4031810","4036510"," I could care less what ER is, but this is what my interpretation of what's going to happen. "
"4036510","4039190"," But then I have to consider, well, what are market conditions?"
"4039970","4049940"," Well, let's say we've got this hedge coming off and you've got, you've got, let's"
"4049940","4053740"," say you've got the market weakness, right?"
"4056050","4057210"," So what's the trade in here?"
"4057990","4063710"," You buy the bottoms, you're selling the rips, and then as we get closer to the 31st, I'm going to"
"4063710","4065850"," have a plan to look for some momentary weakness."
"4065850","4074390"," And if I can grab this dip down here, I'll ride this last dip with month out, three month out"
"4074390","4075550"," calls on Tesla."
"4076030","4078650"," Do I miss this rip on the 31st or first?"
"4079930","4081070"," I have to take my own risk. "
"4081330","4087090"," If I miss this Tesla trade, there's probably five or 10 other tickers I can find where I will find"
"4087090","4088470"," this trade, right?"
"4088970","4091370"," I can move from Tesla to another, to another ticker."
"4092030","4099689"," Probably not going to look exactly like this, but you will probably see some form of rejection down"
"4099689","4099950"," below."
"4103000","4103660"," You see all that?"
"4104200","4105740"," And you have to wear out these sellers. "
"4106600","4108100"," All these people want to sell above here."
"4108880","4109640"," Does that make sense?"
"4111859","4113620"," Yeah, I really don't care about news."
"4114520","4116180"," I normally tried this market. "
"4116960","4122779"," My interpretation of news is when I'm looking for resistance, let's say, I'm going to talk to you"
"4122779","4124040"," guys about news right now."
"4125420","4127300"," So here's a prime example, okay?"
"4129990","4138430"," If I see Tesla, let's say I'm focusing on Tesla news, right?"
"4142410","4143510"," Let's say you break above."
"4145170","4146770"," We're going up here, right?"
"4146950","4152750"," And I hear a Tesla news piece, if it's a negative news piece, I'm going to expect resistance. "
"4153350","4156630"," If it's a positive news piece, I'm going to expect to break through."
"4156990","4157490"," Does that make sense?"
"4158689","4166270"," Do I think that the news created that resistance or support or created that resistance that bounce"
"4166270","4166770"," or not?"
"4167090","4169069"," No, not for a moment."
"4169810","4177189"," I can already see the sellers and buyers before that news piece hits the airwaves, okay?"
"4182510","4184910"," And the only thing that market doesn't like is unknown news. "
"4185870","4188569"," That's why the market doesn't care about news."
"4188930","4192729"," It uses it to its advantage if it wants it to be negative or positive."
"4193490","4198410"," And that's why when you hear people say, or when you hear people say the market hates news, even if"
"4198410","4201690"," it's positive, it's because that stuff's not already priced into the market. "
"4205000","4206620"," The banks control both sides of the trade."
"4207680","4209660"," I don't know if all of you guys know that, but they do."
"4212030","4212490"," Okay. "
"4222440","4224400"," So let's look at your Chaz."
"4224540","4225960"," Let's talk about Chaz, okay?"
"4227040","4228560"," And 480 price target."
"4230900","4232520"," Chaz has a big question he wants answered. "
"4232840","4234020"," We're going to answer for Chaz right now."
"4238550","4242010"," Chaz, do you see the price target up here 480?"
"4253830","4254630"," That's 4798."
"4255250","4256750"," We hit it in the after hours, right?"
"4257290","4259310"," Well, we're talking about spy here you want to talk about, right?"
"4259830","4260610"," 480 on the spy. "
"4261570","4266610"," Let's talk about, let's talk with the spy."
"4273680","4274540"," Let's talk with the spy."
"4275260","4276960"," We can get this closer for you guys. "
"4278200","4281820"," So you've got volatility here at 480, right?"
"4282500","4286540"," We hit 47881, right?"
"4289070","4290950"," Let me ask you a question looking at this chart."
"4290950","4294810"," I want to ask a serious question out there."
"4295870","4296150"," Okay. "
"4297370","4299770"," Was 480 rejected today?"
"4301070","4303250"," Was 480 rejected today?"
"4303870","4306650"," Was 480 25 rejected today?"
"4308030","4309870"," Because I'm going to show you rejection here."
"4310010","4310150"," Okay."
"4313710","4316890"," Was 47 4.98 back here rejected?"
"4320310","4324700"," Was 47 0.52 over here?"
"4328260","4329600"," Was this rejected?"
"4330700","4331660"," No, right?"
"4331880","4332420"," You had consolidation. "
"4333520","4334840"," We eventually broke through."
"4335420","4336240"," But was this rejected?"
"4336780","4336940"," Yes."
"4337180","4338780"," Do you see what a rejection looks like?"
"4339260","4341180"," Do you see what rejections look like?"
"4341840","4344200"," Do you see over here what rejection looks like?"
"4345020","4347620"," Do you see right here what your rejection looks like?"
"4348100","4351600"," Do you see the context difference in a bearish environment?"
"4353100","4353140"," Right?"
"4353340","4355820"," You go up slightly than reject slightly reject. "
"4355820","4360620"," Do you see the bullish context, rejection, new all-time highs?"
"4361240","4363260"," Rejection, new all-time highs."
"4363860","4367580"," Do you see the difference in a bullish context and a bearish context?"
"4368340","4371620"," Do you see when something actually rejects what takes place?"
"4372260","4378470"," You pin, you hit the pin and you literally sell down, right?"
"4379090","4381310"," A failure to make new highs on the next attempt."
"4382210","4389110"," Do you guys see though the difference between a rejection and a consolidation to new all-time"
"4389110","4389390"," highs?"
"4390550","4397890"," So if we rejected here, you would have seen this sell down. "
"4398430","4399450"," It would have been immediate."
"4400450","4407270"," But when we're not doing that, you're seeing what's considered another attempt at all-time highs."
"4408330","4408390"," Okay?"
"4409330","4409950"," Do you see this?"
"4411410","4415730"," So when I say to you today, my price target's 4800. "
"4416110","4417430"," Why am I telling you that?"
"4418290","4420010"," So let's look back over here."
"4423110","4426170"," Does anything about this still say that this is bearish?"
"4428730","4430890"," Is there anything in the context of today?"
"4431410","4433470"," Does this look bearish to you?"
"4434210","4435930"," Because I'll tell you what bearish looks like."
"4437410","4440610"," Bearish would look like what we've experienced in the past. "
"4441410","4446570"," And that would be that we made our way up here and we immediately started selling down."
"4447250","4448350"," Does that make sense?"
"4448350","4452390"," So we're either looking for news."
"4453530","4455830"," And what news are we looking for right now?"
"4455830","4459330"," It's only the hedges that are being put on or something unknown. "
"4460050","4463790"," If you had some major tragedy that took place."
"4464790","4471250"," Because otherwise, this is a consolidation for a move higher."
"4471830","4473190"," Be aware of that. "
"4474250","4479750"," Or a consolidation for some ugly news coming from the banks heading into the first."
"4485380","4485820"," Good."
"4485980","4492200"," I want you guys to be aware of this stuff when you're seeing us hit resistance. "
"4492940","4495320"," This is important at support."
"4495820","4499040"," You guys want to know why down here."
"4499820","4504020"," I think it was this one right here, this trade in the 17th. "
"4504020","4506420"," I'm like, well, we bounced, we bounced, we bounced here."
"4506860","4507860"," This is starting to look bullish."
"4508800","4515000"," And they couldn't actually dump it unless we were in after hours. "
"4515200","4520000"," I can tell you right now, if they tried this shit right here, if this, whatever bank did this,"
"4520320","4524660"," tried this shit in cash market, there's no fucking way that was happening."
"4525240","4528360"," The only way this happened was in the liquid, liquid markets."
"4529680","4529780"," Okay. "
"4529780","4539670"," And you can see that time again, you'll see in the after hours, or not after hours"
"4539670","4544430"," in the overnights, the Globexes, you'll see the PJ traders push a stock up for you."
"4544530","4547670"," You'll see them push a stock down for where you want it."
"4548130","4554150"," This is where the, this is where the after hour, not after hours, but the Globex markets is where"
"4554150","4555890"," the banks are the hand of God. "
"4556510","4560030"," They'll push the price down and kind of fuck you."
"4560030","4562850"," And they'll push the price up and kind of fuck you."
"4564510","4567870"," That was my concern up here was that we would do that here. "
"4568350","4571870"," That's that this is why I put the hedge on here because I'm like, oh, you know what?"
"4572550","4578150"," This is a, there's a real, there's a real fear up here that they could just swoop in, slap the"
"4578150","4581890"," market down to 4600 in the overnight and there'd be nothing any of you could do."
"4582270","4582590"," Nothing."
"4589400","4590320"," Yeah, it's very helpful. "
"4590480","4592260"," It's very important for context."
"4592260","4596880"," It's also important to know that we're in positive gamma or not in negative gamma."
"4597300","4601960"," Whenever we sell down right now in positive gamma, we should be swinging higher. "
"4602560","4607860"," If we're in negative gamma, I wouldn't expect, I wouldn't expect this move."
"4608480","4614580"," If we're negative gamma, if we're in negative gamma, I'm going to expect something more like this."
"4615380","4619640"," So if I'm playing this swing at no time in the swing, am I thinking?"
"4620220","4623620"," Oh, yeah, this is going to go way, way higher, way, way higher. "
"4623820","4632320"," I'm thinking I'm going to buy this swing and sell out on this hard resistance until we show some"
"4632320","4633720"," bottoming down here."
"4634200","4638900"," So even when I'm buying these things, because I want these all the time, I know to sell them at"
"4638900","4639420"," some point."
"4639420","4646720"," And as a bear, if you're taking bearish positions on this side, you know that you have to sell out"
"4646720","4650940"," of your bearish positions at support levels right now, because we're bullish. "
"4651800","4653780"," So the same thing works."
"4654860","4662160"," And if you see more rejection here, if you see one tap, two taps, three taps, four taps, the bulls"
"4662160","4664580"," only get so many chances to go higher."
"4664580","4668880"," And as time passes, I will get more bearish. "
"4669760","4678280"," So right now, I'm looking for news where I'm looking for three or four attempts at 40, 48, 25, and"
"4678280","4680780"," I'll switch on a diamond become ultra bear."
"4681540","4682000"," Okay."
"4682600","4684140"," All right, so that's all I've got for you guys. "
"4689730","4691670"," Yeah, the bias right now is not down."
"4692030","4693330"," The bias right now is we're bullish."
"4694270","4694830"," We're retesting. "
"4695410","4697510"," We're attempting to make all time highs once again."
"4698710","4703510"," We'll take at least three, four, five stab or three, we'll take at least three stabs at that."
"4704010","4707510"," And if on the third time we reject, we'll head down and test some lower levels. "
"4708850","4713950"," And then we've got all the other crap going on the background with the banks with the hedging and"
"4713950","4714630"," all that other stuff."
"4715170","4720850"," That's going to, and it's funny too, because when that stuff comes into play, you'll be hearing on"
"4720850","4721670"," social media."
"4722570","4726630"," At those events being attributed to a rejection. "
"4728390","4736130"," You'll you'll hear those events being attributed to to weakness in the markets or, you know, the"
"4736130","4737110"," bulls have been exhausted."
"4737310","4738170"," You'll hear all this stuff."
"4738570","4742850"," But in reality, it's just a function functions that are going on in the back of the market. "
"4743250","4749670"," I bet if you see weakness up between January 31st and January 1st or January 3rd, you'll end up"
"4749670","4749990"," seeing."
"4751330","4754410"," You'll end up seeing some bullshit news associated with it."
"4754770","4757090"," Oh, Decepticon virus is the reason. "
"4757470","4759970"," Oh, the inflation concerns are back on the menu."
"4760350","4761150"," It's all bullshit."
"4761670","4762210"," It's all wise. "
"4762650","4764710"," There are mechanics taking place in the market right now."
"4765210","4766450"," And that's the real truth."
"4766670","4768290"," That's what's happening in the background. "
"4769130","4769470"," Okay."
"4770650","4771610"," Let's keep that in mind."
"4771810","4775650"," And then the last thing I'll tell you guys keep in mind is remember that we have a short week. "
"4775910","4778810"," Remember that on Friday, we have a short day."
"4778810","4781350"," Remember that we have banks closed around the world."
"4781790","4783630"," Remember that we've got bond markets closed. "
"4784250","4786450"," Remember that we've got a three day weekend, I think, right?"
"4786710","4787430"," Is it three days, guys?"
"4788010","4788190"," Is it?"
"4788930","4794250"," So we got, you'll have some 31st to half day, first, second."
"4794890","4797770"," So you've got four days almost of theta burn."
"4798350","4800110"," So be conscience of that as well. "
"4802590","4807670"," And then one other thing to remember, if you're a bull is we've been trading in a bear."
"4807890","4809350"," We've been trading on low volume."
"4810170","4818110"," So if we have volume kickback in on the third, it could amplify positions for both bulls and bears. "
"4822300","4825360"," We've got the diamond top diamond reversal, huh?"
"4826140","4826820"," That's what we're doing."
"4826860","4828200"," The diamond top diamond reversal."
"4828540","4829180"," You guys are hilarious. "
"4833150","4833790"," Right on Omar."
"4834410","4836070"," Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't."
"4836550","4838130"," We're in a bullish context right now. "
"4839330","4840310"," I'd like to see."
"4840310","4843970"," I'm, I'm, I'm gunning for this 40, 40, 40, 20, somewhere up in here."
"4844350","4846430"," Could be 40, 100, 40. "
"4847010","4850170"," Well, the cash market and the ES charts are different."
"4850870","4854910"," It'd be like, I'd probably be looking for a cash market for eight, zero."
"4855870","4857870"," And I'd be looking at an ES for eight. "
"4859350","4861990"," Two, five, four, eight, five, zero."
"4864110","4867350"," For a tag up below, some kind of a grind, some face melter."
"4867910","4873570"," And then I'd be looking for a sell down into the, into the new year for an ER run. "
"4874750","4875810"," That's my trading plan."
"4876190","4877970"," You guys have to do your own trading plan."
"4878410","4880510"," You guys have to do your own due diligence. "
"4881790","4883850"," Ultimately, you're responsible for your own trades."
"4884450","4887070"," Remember that you have to put the big boy pants on."
"4887330","4888650"," It's ultimately your money. "
"4889150","4889930"," It's not my money."
"4890090","4891190"," You know, it's your bank account."
"4891670","4897590"," If there's too much risk or if this market's too complicated for you at this moment, remember, I"
"4897590","4898850"," always tell you guys out there. "
"4900850","4904870"," You can always hit the easy button and you trade these moves down."
"4905070","4906950"," You trade these larger moves up."
"4907610","4913730"," You know, when you, when you sit back, you smoke a cigar, you drink a cup of coffee or cup"
"4913730","4914090"," of tea. "
"4915970","4919390"," And you look back at these larger moves, right?"
"4921050","4923310"," It's easy for you to just say, you know what I'm going to do?"
"4924310","4928050"," I'm going to wait until we, we, we start coming down over here and then I'm going to throw a"
"4928050","4928490"," trade on."
"4928870","4931050"," Do you have to capture this entire move?"
"4931310","4931410"," No."
"4932350","4934470"," Do you have to capture this entire move?"
"4934710","4934810"," No. "
"4935690","4937530"," You just have to capture, capture parts of it."
"4937650","4937810"," Okay."
"4938570","4940450"," Right now we don't know where we're going here. "
"4940910","4942290"," And this is the, the grind area."
"4942510","4948470"," This is where we eat up bulls, eat up bears until we make our next move."
"4949490","4952770"," So look at the, on a larger context, look at it at a one year. "
"4955840","4960580"," I guess this chart kind of sucks to be looking at right now, but just take a breather, sit back."
"4961240","4965620"," There are larger moves that are easier to trade and it might not be for you right now."
"4968190","4971110"," But for the rest of you out there, I've got some longs. "
"4971390","4972230"," I've got some shorts."
"4972730","4974170"," We'll see how they work out as we move forward."
"4974830","4975090"," Okay. "
"4979350","4984230"," New Year's Eve rule 7.20. Four eight bourbon wife's boys zero."
"4985650","4986330"," It's the Quinn."
"4986910","4987250"," Yeah. "
"4987450","4988270"," Daventop is the Quinn."
"4991840","4992340"," All right."
"4992420","4993320"," It's good to see all of you. "
"4993700","4995000"," How you guys all have a great night."
"4998760","5002860"," Yeah, we, I'm going to probably have to talk to a few, if any of you traders are listening in"
"5002860","5005020"," right now that are interested in."
"5006760","5007480"," Participating actively. "
"5008080","5013460"," And if you know, if you don't have a lot of markets experience, but want to moderate, maybe the"
"5013460","5014440"," general discussion thread."
"5014440","5016080"," And keep it positive."
"5017200","5019560"," I need, we'd need, we'd need some help with that. "
"5020600","5023340"," And then if any of you guys are active traders."
"5024940","5027880"," In the Globex markets or in the cash market."
"5028740","5033500"," If any of you are great at investing, I know Quinn is an old Tesla wolf is. "
"5034560","5037140"," I don't know if they watch this program, but."
"5038080","5042320"," I know that some of you out there are very profitable and successful."
"5043880","5045420"," And actively like to invest. "
"5046860","5051700"," And if any of you are interested in getting, getting started and something like that, give me a DM"
"5051700","5053300"," on the captain's alpha handle."
"5054740","5056320"," And we'll try to start our discord."
"5057140","5057160"," Okay. "
"5057660","5058960"," Have a wonderful night, everybody."
"5059760","5063200"," Don't forget to like, subscribe if you can, if you don't, if you're broken, just a new trader."
"5064080","5066680"," It helps me to develop the videos that we're going to start rolling out. "
"5066780","5068040"," We're going to roll out a trading class."
"5068540","5068800"," It's free."
"5070300","5071100"," No paywalls. "
"5071100","5077340"," If any of you are making money or not losing your shirts, or if you're just learning any tools from"
"5077340","5080580"," us that we're giving you that are helping please donate if you can."
"5081960","5083880"," We put the heroin decatur up today."
"5084140","5084600"," It did. "
"5084740","5085680"," It was like, it was limp."
"5085820","5086300"," It didn't work."
"5086560","5091900"," I have to go back in tonight and try to get that hero indicator onto maybe all the Fangman plus"
"5091900","5093860"," T stocks and make sure that it's actually running. "
"5093860","5099340"," I think I think I've put the key that might, I think I've put my license key in and I"
"5099340","5102300"," didn't want to do that live stream today because it would be public."
"5102920","5107280"," So I will work on that for tomorrow to get the hero indicator going for you guys."
"5108980","5111160"," I'll do a class on the hero indicator as well. "
"5111340","5112300"," Just a basic idea."
"5112560","5114740"," Before I sign off, I want to talk to you guys about the hero indicator."
"5115460","5116920"," So let's talk about the hero indicator. "
"5119440","5121040"," We can actually do this right now."
"5124380","5125660"," We're going to talk about the hero indicator."
"5126800","5133220"," If the hero indicator is following the movements of the stock market. "
"5133940","5135520"," It does not work."
"5136240","5137160"," Does that make sense?"
"5137820","5141980"," So if you guys see the hero indicator doing this move here, it doesn't work."
"5142920","5149440"," But if you see the stock market going down or your favorite ticker going down and you see a"
"5149440","5150060"," divergence. "
"5153840","5161140"," If you see a divergence between the price of a stock going down and the hero indicator going up, it"
"5161140","5165540"," infers that that stock is at the end of its consolidation."
"5166300","5167200"," It's going to break higher."
"5168440","5168480"," Okay. "
"5169660","5176640"," If you see, if you see the hero indicator."
"5179100","5187350"," Let's say you see the hero indicator following down here."
"5187930","5188550"," Right. "
"5188550","5194250"," And the hero indicator goes down, but the stock is going up."
"5194770","5196130"," That's a false breakout."
"5196190","5197610"," It'll eventually crash. "
"5198850","5199010"," Okay."
"5199510","5206190"," So you're looking for a divergence from the hero indicator to the normal trading of the day."
"5209980","5211120"," Yeah, it's going to be badass. "
"5211520","5213080"," This hero indicator when it works."
"5214840","5217360"," This hero indicator when it works is insane."
"5217360","5222040"," So you'll be able to identify before anyone else in the market. "
"5222720","5228760"," At times you're going to be able to identify fake bottoms, fake tops."
"5229580","5232420"," You'll be able to be ahead of everyone else in the market."
"5232960","5234900"," That's how awesome this indicator is. "
"5235900","5237340"," It should pay for itself."
"5238040","5239620"," Four or five times a month."
"5240120","5244320"," It should it should print big at least four or five times in the month. "
"5244720","5246040"," It's a really neat indicator."
"5246790","5253620"," It'll diverge from wherever it'll be showing you some kind of a move."
"5253860","5255060"," It'll be showing you something. "
"5255620","5258000"," Sometimes you'll even be like this."
"5258700","5260440"," I'm not really doing this the best here."
"5261440","5264080"," You'll see like, wait a minute. "
"5267150","5267830"," Excuse me."
"5269290","5279080"," You'll see, you'll see like actually the actual movements of the hero indicator would be like this."
"5279080","5281080"," This is actually what the hero indicator would look like. "
"5281580","5288840"," If we were doing this live on spy, you'd see it go like this, right?"
"5289640","5291040"," And you'd see it go down."
"5292420","5295780"," And so everybody would be like, whoo, riding this up, whoo, whoo."
"5296360","5299620"," And you'd already know before everybody else that we're going to, we're going to reject hard. "
"5300140","5300940"," Does that make sense?"
"5302140","5304000"," So you're like, okay, I'm riding this up."
"5304080","5306260"," All of a sudden you have divergence with the hero indicator."
"5307000","5311040"," And indicators coming up, you see the versions, you already know where resistance is. "
"5311540","5313760"," And you'd say, Oh, shit, I have to go short here."
"5314760","5316760"," And that's where the actual move would be."
"5322020","5326900"," It's an indicator that is put out by spot gamma for book map. "
"5327480","5330140"," I think it costs like a hundred and fifteen bucks a month."
"5330700","5333340"," If you're a non professional, it's used by professionals."
"5334040","5334860"," It's used by retail. "
"5338170","5341030"," So I use a, I use book map with."
"5341030","5346110"," A bunch of different feeds and then I use a bunch of different paid for indicators."
"5346850","5350070"," I think that one costs me twelve hundred bucks a year, thirteen hundred bucks a year. "
"5353870","5354150"," Okay."
"5354530","5355270"," You guys have a great night."
"5355650","5356770"," I look forward to trade with you tomorrow. "
"5357210","5359710"," If you guys want to know, you guys want to know what I think about what's going to happen tomorrow"
"5359710","5360530"," before I hang up here."
"5361250","5363310"," You guys want to know what my thoughts are for morning."
"5365550","5366130"," More consolidation. "
"5367730","5372850"," Selling the rips, day traders, boiler rooms, selling them, selling the rips above at forty eight"
"5372850","5374510"," hundred and then buying the dips down below."
"5374510","5379150"," So you're going to be looking to be buying dips down below here at this forty seven."
"5379390","5380950"," We show you and we both will make it easier. "
"5381590","5382750"," Selling any rips above."
"5383270","5391350"," Look for a movement and an eventually a tap at forty eight hundred four eight zero on cash between"
"5391350","5393250"," now and Friday."
"5393730","5398790"," We could possibly grind up into Friday and then I'm looking for a sell down. "
"5399990","5402330"," Could be anytime Thursday morning."
"5403230","5405230"," Price is more important to me than time."
"5405850","5411710"," I'm looking for price action and then I'm looking for a sell down and for the big banks to head"
"5411710","5414450"," into to swoop in and start to buy their positions. "
"5417580","5421040"," Hey Quinn, I've been talking about you for the last hour and a half."
"5421440","5426260"," You're one of my I look if you any guys don't follow Quinn on on regular Twitter."
"5426800","5427720"," He's one of my biggest falls. "
"5427980","5428560"," I love that guy."
"5428840","5431700"," He puts out some he puts out some great great content."
"5431700","5433380"," Very smart person. "
"5434260","5435240"," May him for markets."
"5435480","5435940"," I follow him."
"5436260","5437680"," Joe Joe donut. "
"5438360","5438800"," Chaz."
"5439420","5441880"," But if you guys fall, make sure you guys are following Quinn out there."
"5443500","5445760"," He knows how to trade knows how to invest. "
"5449460","5450260"," Good to see you Quinn."
"5451300","5451960"," All right."
"5452400","5453380"," All of you have a wonderful evening. "
"5453980","5455140"," I look forward to trading with you tomorrow."
"5455220","5460540"," You'll have a live stream and I'll be focusing on individual tickers or even the ES as we move"
"5460540","5460940"," forward."
"5460940","5462900"," Good night. "
