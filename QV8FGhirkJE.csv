"180870","184030"," There's been some tough times and good times, of course, you know, with any year."
"186150","191330"," It's past couple years have been tough for everybody right around the world."
"192290","194350"," Morning Joel Trevor hit Mikey. "
"197150","199410"," Looks like Tesla's opening up right on."
"199590","200150"," I haven't looked yet."
"200250","200870"," We're going to look at Tesla. "
"201590","203510"," I guess some really neat stuff this morning."
"206150","211970"," Yeah, we're going to talk about the straddle in the market kind of a thing and see how that plays"
"211970","213930"," out today and into tomorrow."
"214030","216590"," We're going to talk about tomorrow, not tomorrow, but Monday. "
"218670","219430"," Morning speed."
"220610","221470"," Yeah, we're going to talk."
"221590","224610"," We should be able to talk about this today because today should be an interesting day. "
"224790","231290"," It's actually worked out closer to our initial thoughts, right, than anything else."
"231990","232510"," You kind of talked"
"232510","243970"," about"
"243970","243990"," it."
"244590","245990"," We're going to talk about that today. "
"246730","248030"," We're going to talk about that, too."
"248630","249230"," Good morning, everybody."
"249470","249970"," Good morning, John. "
"252150","253110"," Yeah, we'll talk about Amazon."
"253390","254530"," We'll talk about everything this morning."
"255350","258070"," And we'll talk about the entire context of the market this morning. "
"258370","261010"," It hasn't been as surprising as we think it has, right?"
"261370","266730"," Except for maybe the speculative growth stocks ripping yesterday, which was a nice to see, of"
"266730","268730"," course, is a lot of us were in those stocks."
"270210","274590"," There might be some still some selling down today and some stocks."
"274650","276690"," We're going to talk about that here in just a moment. "
"278130","279010"," Jarken, good morning."
"279570","280510"," Happy New Year, Jarken."
"282050","283450"," Good morning, boy, JP. "
"284630","287470"," If you're just joining us, we haven't talked about much just yet."
"288330","289570"," We're going to make it a simple day today."
"290770","292990"," I don't expect, well, we'll talk about it. "
"293010","294530"," We're going to go through it all this morning as."
"294530","298370"," As before I open."
"301870","304030"," And I'm going to look up one thing. "
"304130","308490"," The one thing you guys want to be doing this morning is keep your eyes out."
"309550","310910"," For do like a."
"312010","313890"," Keep your eyes out for the JPM."
"315350","315830"," Collar. "
"316910","318610"," Maybe I'll do a search for it."
"318790","320350"," See if anyone's found it."
"331390","335910"," So I'm assuming I'm assuming there's enough people out there watching for it this morning. "
"336050","338410"," I saw a big giant green bar this morning on the spy."
"339110","341710"," I wasn't sure if that was it."
"341770","343970"," It should be coming on SPX at some point. "
"349340","354340"," So yeah, the MMS have to buy back the short yes for the new collar that's going on."
"355900","357140"," Happy New Year to all of you."
"357300","358160"," I hope you're all safe. "
"358400","358820"," I hope you're all."
"358820","364340"," I just want to say, I don't have to say this, but if you do go out, please be safe."
"364720","368620"," Please use an Uber or don't drink and drive or drug and drive or whatever. "
"370360","373900"," There's no, you know, I always call days like today, amateur hour."
"374860","376820"," You know, I could, St. Patrick's Day."
"377060","382120"," I'm from Boston from my mother's from South Boston and from Southie, the old Southie, right?"
"382120","388600"," And my parents and I, when I was young, they always call it amateur night because there's so many"
"388600","390820"," people that get into so much trouble, right?"
"391200","395720"," And then I think the biggest day of the year for DWIs isn't New Year's Eve. "
"395900","396620"," It's New Year's Day."
"397140","399880"," The cops will try to catch it like 9, 10 o'clock in the morning."
"400580","401260"," So just stay safe. "
"401380","402660"," None of you guys want a DWI."
"403080","404260"," Those things are horrible."
"406600","407920"," Good morning, Bob. "
"408900","418140"," So Bob Walsh is saying it should trade between 9.45 and 10.30 a.m. About collar roll being"
"418140","419900"," overblown and having no market impact."
"420620","424200"," You know, I didn't see Chems Rants last night."
"426160","432760"," And I don't, so I think we had a conversation about six months ago, and we were making fun of"
"432760","433140"," each other. "
"433360","434840"," And I think he blocked me and I blocked him."
"434980","438580"," I think he came into one of my threads and said something's not going to happen."
"438580","439200"," And then it did. "
"439380","440620"," And then I went back and laughed at him."
"440680","441380"," So he blocked me."
"441560","443440"," And then I wound up blocking him. "
"443780","445300"," I think I should unblock him or something."
"446480","448000"," I don't know how the conversation went."
"448200","449640"," I can't recall exactly how it went. "
"450380","451180"," And I like him."
"451320","452300"," He's a very smart guy."
"453700","455420"," And I didn't, I didn't track him last night. "
"455540","455880"," I will though."
"456100","459920"," I'll go into today and check that doesn't have a big impact, but it does."
"459920","462800"," It does because people are waiting for it. "
"463060","464600"," Other hedge funds are waiting for it."
"464680","465760"," Banks are waiting for it."
"466220","473240"," They move the market so much with the expansion and contraction of volatility of gamma in the"
"473240","473580"," market. "
"474280","477820"," You know, the banks pretty much we think we decide."
"478140","479280"," Well, let's say this."
"479400","483000"," We have a lot of unknown stuff that of course we can't impact the market with. "
"483400","488560"," But you know the banks plan for the market to go certain places in a year or in a three"
"488560","488980"," month period."
"488980","490260"," You can't deny that."
"490880","496400"," And they open and close gamma volatility ranges within the market themselves. "
"497260","498320"," So he's on the right track."
"498500","499140"," He shouldn't."
"499140","501380"," He shouldn't have to cover so much for what he says. "
"501520","502140"," I like what he says."
"508090","511390"," Some doubt that a vibe we see was correct in regards to the color effect."
"515250","516669"," Your wife's getting upset chase. "
"517130","518210"," Tell her I said Happy New Year."
"519190","522490"," My kids are mad at me because they just kicked them off the Internet and try to figure out this"
"522490","523030"," Internet thing."
"523470","526510"," I just sign up for the best Internet and then I got to like separate it all or something. "
"527610","529750"," So yeah, I've got some upset failures this morning."
"530010","533350"," So what we're going to do before the market gets open here this morning is want to run through this"
"533350","533590"," stuff."
"534810","536790"," If any of you haven't said hello this morning. "
"537290","538250"," Good morning to you."
"538450","539690"," Happy New Year to you."
"539950","542090"," Hope you're safe and happy these next couple days. "
"542630","545850"," Hope that we can put last year behind us and look forward to New Year."
"546350","549810"," We're going to talk mainly about what's going to happen today."
"550750","556330"," What we should expect next week and some just some forward looking into next week. "
"557210","561870"," We're going to have I'm going to have a live stream on Sunday."
"562270","566610"," Hopefully prepared for you for some expectations into the new year."
"567730","570050"," And we'll see how those play out for 2022. "
"570050","570610"," Right."
"571330","574590"," Now for today we have nothing on the economic calendar."
"574950","578370"," I do want to highlight for you though that next week. "
"579310","583270"," The important events are basically jobs."
"583670","583670"," Right."
"584090","585830"," Jobs are big for us next week. "
"586870","589390"," We have openings and quits on Tuesday at 10."
"589650","595450"," We have the ADP employment report on Wednesday at 8.15. We have some FOMC minutes on Wednesday."
"596090","598090"," Well, we all know that's usually a non event. "
"598710","601030"," We do have claims and continuing claims on Thursday."
"601710","605090"," Non farm payroll is the biggie on Friday in employment rates."
"605090","606710"," So next week is all about jobs. "
"607570","612090"," We know that sometimes jobs roll off as we head into the New Year."
"613070","616070"," The part time temporary workers kind of go away."
"616930","619510"," But that's the big thing for next week to be looking forward to. "
"620210","622230"," That's all I've got for you in the economic calendar."
"622710","628330"," We're going to look briefly at the volume profile for the market."
"628330","630370"," And this is the ES chart. "
"630590","631790"," The spy chart is very similar."
"632410","634690"," And you'll see there at the bottom of this note here."
"634770","635810"," This iceberg right here. "
"635970","636050"," Right."
"636410","645310"," You can see that the value area low is 462.23. And we've got some some space here to fill"
"645310","645510"," in."
"645610","645710"," Right. "
"646070","649050"," So I think normally you would say to yourself."
"650030","651670"," I think normally you would say to yourself."
"652310","653830"," We're probably going down today. "
"653830","654070"," Right."
"654430","655490"," If we were going to the norm market."
"655490","658030"," I would say we're going down to 4720 easy. "
"658370","660450"," Maybe start grinding through these numbers."
"660950","667130"," And I'm going to show you the move the moving averages to and how it relates to this down here"
"667130","667390"," later."
"667990","671150"," But for today you're probably going to see some buying today. "
"671850","677370"," And there's a fair chance right that you'll see this iceberg get eaten through into end of day to"
"677370","679270"," that 480 pin that we keep talking about."
"679270","681610"," Now when we are eating through here."
"681850","685730"," Let's say you get some some large volume share trading. "
"685990","686050"," Right."
"686690","688770"," And then it goes away."
"689390","693870"," You'll see moments of volatility where we drop down in this area because we have we don't really"
"693870","695490"," have a lot of space in here. "
"696030","700930"," So think I think my projection for today is that we're going to try to pin 480 at some point"
"700930","701250"," today."
"702330","705430"," There could be moments of volatility where we fall through you guys."
"705670","706490"," It'll be similar. "
"706850","712310"," I think to normal O pecs is on a Friday where you see really jagged movements in the candlestick"
"712310","712550"," charts."
"713690","714770"," So that's all I've got for you."
"714850","718130"," Yes, you know, in a normal day, I would tell you buy some puts and hold. "
"718390","718450"," Right."
"718690","720070"," That's what I'd be telling you for today."
"720770","722930"," We're going to look at the E.S. or excuse me. "
"723010","724370"," We're going to look at NQ real quick."
"726270","728410"," And you know, NQ is really a neat chart."
"728890","729190"," Wait a minute. "
"729390","729790"," Hold on here."
"729850","730510"," I get the wrong chart."
"733130","735670"," So on the NQ chart, I want to show you this. "
"735770","736390"," So this is kind of neat."
"738530","743730"," You guys like these charts because you can sometimes bet that we move much, much higher here."
"744230","750670"," If we move above this iceberg right here today, it would be very, very possible that we trade up to"
"750670","753330"," that 16, 900 or 17,000 number. "
"753330","759270"," You want to pay attention to the volume profile today, as if we don't trade up here, we're going to"
"759270","765110"," make a pretty, pretty significant move down to this 16,000 into next week, possibly Monday."
"765710","773030"," We'll talk about the volatility as well and how that plays into this move today and into Monday."
"774230","776690"," Next, I want to show you is RTY. "
"777910","780750"," You guys can come back and pause this video later."
"780750","782650"," I'm going to sign off here at some point."
"783250","786870"," And you can get these levels, these value area lows and value area highs. "
"787410","790250"," I think this is 15 minute on a 10 day."
"791190","797090"," And what's interesting is the chart for IWM for the Russell looks slightly better, right?"
"798090","802470"," Where if we got a bid in RTY today, we might muscle over this 225."
"802470","808030"," And we know that we can get, if we break past this 228, what happens then?"
"808510","811370"," We know that we're going to set, we're going to squeeze some shorts. "
"811730","817210"," So I'm still interested in all of this consolidation here on RTY on IWM."
"817850","824710"," I don't know if it happens today or next week, but I really am interested in this in the recovery"
"824710","826010"," of IWM in small caps."
"826010","832070"," And we already know that we've looked down here and this, this value area low down here to 16 to"
"832070","834730"," 13, these levels down here. "
"835170","838310"," We kind of know that there's a significant bottom down here."
"838790","841230"," And we've looked below down here three times."
"841610","842850"," We know that we've beaten up. "
"842950","844010"," We've had this stealth correction."
"844770","845690"," You know, it's interesting."
"845930","847030"," I was looking at the charts for spy. "
"848070","850630"," And we've had a stealth correction under the market."
"850630","852770"," Like S and P since May."
"853250","855050"," And I'll show you that briefly on that chart. "
"855530","860470"," It's just when you start to look at the correction that's gone on in IWM and in the spy and"
"860470","862090"," everyone's saying we're going sideways in a 2022."
"862870","866530"," It's kind of odd because and then they're saying we're going to dump in late summer."
"867170","872690"," When you start to look at the curling over the rolling over of spy, it's really been taking place"
"872690","873310"," since May. "
"874510","876450"," And no one really talks about that."
"876490","878490"," Everyone's talking about that it's happening right now."
"878490","884050"," And everybody talks about all time highs, but our all time highs are us going sideways and making"
"884050","884710"," all time highs. "
"884990","887810"," In reality, we've we've left this channel since May."
"888070","889450"," So we'll take a look at that here in just a minute."
"890070","892690"," I'm just interested in that and we've got something on Tesla. "
"892690","893370"," It's kind of neat."
"893590","896250"," At the end of the yesterday's podcast, we were talking about."
"896810","904590"," We were talking yesterday about if we we need to make this move above about above 10 80, right?"
"904590","906390"," I was talking to you last night. "
"906690","907930"," We need to get over this iceberg."
"908290","912950"," If we can't get over this iceberg, the next move down is quite severe."
"913670","920530"," You can see the 939 down here is the first target, but we could see a sell down in Tesla"
"920530","922330"," to the 758 hundreds. "
"922830","929310"," Now, I'm a Tesla bull, but I just want you to be aware that as we head into into this"
"929310","932590"," new year, if you were to see any kind of selling for profit."
"933450","935990"," Into the new year last day of the year."
"936510","939250"," This is a dangerous place for for Tesla. "
"939550","941390"," And we'll look at the Tesla chart here this morning."
"942190","943550"," For any of you Tesla gang out there."
"943930","947430"," I just want to show you that there is some danger here for Tesla. "
"948030","949930"," I took some calls yesterday in Tesla."
"950390","953170"," I don't know if they're going to burn today if they're going to go up into clothes and make some"
"953170","953410"," money."
"953890","955590"," I can't tell you what's going to happen. "
"955590","957470"," You know how you know how Tesla is."
"957770","962650"," You could be looking at this here as just in consolidation for a rip much higher and you might see"
"962650","966590"," some forced buying for funds into the new year today."
"967230","968930"," So I'm going to be paying attention to Tesla today. "
"969450","974250"," It's on my radar to see if they were selling for profit or if we're going to trade up and"
"974250","974850"," over today."
"975450","981970"," Really this it says 11 17 here, but the 11 20 needs to be claimed like it's not it's a"
"981970","984730"," do or die kind of a thing with Tesla at this point."
"985110","987990"," So be conscious of that as we move forward. "
"988350","992370"," And then we are going to show you what a log off you have a log off this."
"993130","996130"," And we are going to move back over here."
"997210","1000030"," And it's 9 17 so I got to be fast about this. "
"1000030","1000310"," Okay."
"1001450","1006310"," This is what I want to talk to you about here on Tesla."
"1007270","1008830"," We have our by the dip down here. "
"1008970","1016150"," We talked about 4 75 0 being support for the market and for spy and we can see we recovered."
"1016150","1021150"," We had low liquidity overnight and we recovered right to the 47 5 on the opening bell."
"1021450","1023930"," So what am I looking for today in the market?"
"1024050","1029910"," I'm looking for us to trade up to this pin anywhere from 4 79 to 480 up in here. "
"1029910","1032150"," I'm looking for some sort of a pin up here today."
"1032750","1034690"," Can I see we see some jagged little moves?"
"1034970","1035069"," Sure."
"1035490","1036970"," Am I going to buy this bottom today?"
"1037030","1037430"," Probably. "
"1037770","1044450"," And I've got some spreads for this for 79 480 and I've got some I've got some puts for Monday"
"1044450","1048730"," for 460 P and I'm going to add to both of these positions."
"1049170","1053890"," Depending on where we go today, but I do want you guys to realize that one of the biggest volatile"
"1053890","1058790"," days of the year is the 31st into the 1st or the 3rd."
"1059070","1060390"," We could see it. "
"1060410","1061910"," Let's say we pin it 480 today."
"1062010","1066410"," If we go to this 480 mark today, I'm going to sell the news into Monday."
"1067050","1067210"," Okay. "
"1067690","1073550"," If we sell debt, if we begin to sell down today and continue to sell down out of today, I've"
"1073550","1075230"," got these puts and I'll add to them."
"1075230","1079870"," But my thought process is that we go up today and then it's a sell the news into Monday."
"1081070","1085050"," We'll see if we see that the bid come into the market, the range expansion. "
"1085810","1088430"," So let's say I take this up today to 480."
"1089550","1093550"," I'm going to sell the news into Monday and then I'll be looking for the 50."
"1094030","1095590"," I'm going to put an indicator up here for you. "
"1097150","1098490"," I guess set this up earlier."
"1098730","1102890"," I'm going to show you guys something that's important for you to see."
"1102890","1103250"," Okay. "
"1104450","1105950"," This is the 50 here."
"1106410","1108410"," And I believe the 21 ma."
"1109350","1111770"," And as we consolidate, we always talk about this consolidation. "
"1112070","1112450"," We come down."
"1112570","1112990"," We come down."
"1113230","1118450"," And eventually we're going to be a magnet for both the 20 and the 50 and you see where they're"
"1118450","1119010"," coming, right?"
"1119470","1120370"," They're coming to this 470. "
"1121010","1122230"," They're already up to 460."
"1123210","1128310"," So anyone that's like, Hey, we go into the 60 460 or anything like that as time passes, right?"
"1128310","1134710"," The 20 and the 50 are just going to be up here in this 465 to 470 range."
"1135850","1138590"," So I might even be, I might even be missed. "
"1140570","1145190"," Personally, I might be, I might be mispositioned."
"1145750","1150530"," I might have to take my 460s off and get more like a 465 for 70."
"1151090","1156050"," So even if you're bearish this market, remember that the 20 21 and the 50 are going to be up"
"1156050","1158230"," here by Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week. "
"1158710","1160470"," So how far do we sell down?"
"1160550","1162450"," Do we sell down past the 50 heading into next week?"
"1162790","1164690"," I'm kind of finding that hard to believe at this point."
"1164850","1165050"," Okay."
"1165470","1170350"," So remember that this remember this time passes, even though we're even though we're trading down"
"1170350","1174750"," the time for the bulls gives them advantage. "
"1175630","1178150"," Okay, for how deep this this pullback is."
"1178650","1181110"," So be conscious of that as we move into next week."
"1181110","1183770"," You end up getting the 20 coming up here to the 470. "
"1184450","1186350"," You end up getting the 50 coming up to like the 465."
"1187490","1189830"," You're not really getting this meaningful pullback."
"1190070","1192210"," You know, it's like the drink in the milkshake thing we always talk about. "
"1193270","1196550"," Okay, so I'm looking for 480 today on spy."
"1197650","1201350"," We had the bounce the same bounces here in the ES this morning."
"1202550","1204570"," And it's the same kind of a story, right?"
"1204750","1205670"," We hit 480 here. "
"1205670","1211990"," If you're if you're trading the futures are yesterday, you're going to be looking for 4825, which"
"1211990","1212450"," is above."
"1213090","1216110"," I can snap a line here for if you guys want to come back to it."
"1216350","1221210"," But this is your price target here today for ES is way up here at 4825. "
"1221770","1223030"," So we'll see if we can get up here."
"1223210","1225490"," This is a pretty significant move for ES."
"1226390","1228250"," I'm interested to see if it happens. "
"1228950","1232970"," This would this would be coincide with people buying this market."
"1232970","1237410"," Okay, and we haven't seen we haven't seen it happen all week long."
"1237710","1240530"," We have not seen major call flow all week long. "
"1240910","1243470"," We have not seen major equity buying all week long."
"1243630","1246730"," And if we're down to this last day, does it happen today?"
"1246970","1252570"," If it doesn't happen today, we'll revisit it on Sunday because then we're looking quite negative at"
"1252570","1256530"," that point for the upcoming winter end of winter and spring trade."
"1256530","1260890"," We might be trading the dollar or trading the oil and stuff like that, right?"
"1261570","1262790"," Maybe gold and that kind of stuff. "
"1262890","1263730"," So we'll talk about that on Sunday."
"1264030","1268690"," We're going to be looking to see what happens today if we could actually get this tagged this 4825"
"1268690","1269230"," today."
"1269890","1273670"," I think that there are a lot of our futures traders that are interested in this trade as well. "
"1274110","1277910"," If we're trading up, we're just going to start selling down right off the open on ES."
"1278910","1280390"," We'll take a look at the IBM chart."
"1280650","1286510"," This is the haven't changed any of these charts all week long. "
"1286510","1287590"," RTY, I'm sorry."
"1288110","1289330"," I'll give you guys an RTY chart."
"1293150","1293570"," Clear. "
"1294290","1298650"," I was over here talking about I was over here drunk drawn on my zigzag lines the other day."
"1303030","1304410"," Could actually bring this out."
"1306110","1308710"," Yeah, you know, you know, it's decision time, right?"
"1309070","1310590"," Are they going to buy it on the market?"
"1310750","1311350"," We're going to move above. "
"1311350","1314950"," Or are we going to start trading down into the same area down here?"
"1315130","1316470"," We have traded down here, though."
"1316890","1319130"," One, two, three, four times."
"1319970","1326650"," The IBM right now is giving me the idea that we trade up and we start to stabilize small caps. "
"1327530","1329530"," So I'm interested in this play today."
"1330010","1331690"," I'm interested in taking some spreads."
"1332030","1336450"," I'm bullish on IWM into, let's call it like mid February. "
"1336870","1338570"," I'm interested in taking that trade."
"1339010","1339430"," I've been talking."
"1339430","1342450"," I took it earlier down here and I want to take it again. "
"1343030","1345610"," I think it's almost ready to take once more."
"1347210","1348950"," And that's all I've got for you this morning."
"1349070","1350450"," I'll show you guys and keep real quick. "
"1350610","1351170"," I'll show you guys Tesla."
"1353070","1354490"," And what I'm talking about on Tesla."
"1357390","1359230"," You can do Tesla fans out there. "
"1359230","1363990"," And you can see here."
"1364150","1368570"," This is this is the 50 right here on Tesla."
"1368810","1370230"," This is critical support for Tesla. "
"1371070","1372930"," And this is make a break time, right?"
"1373690","1375750"," You can see that right make a break time right here."
"1377170","1381690"," You can see that the 20 had the 21 has broken below here, right?"
"1382710","1385350"," And you can kind of see what happens here when we break below."
"1385350","1388750"," You can sometimes see and you see this nice break below, right?"
"1389090","1394050"," But if you see the 21 coming back up here, what usually happens is it gives that nice lift. "
"1394410","1400290"," So we are looking today to see if the 21 can cross the 50 and start to bring us up"
"1400290","1402830"," and over this 1200 level."
"1403030","1406090"," This is a critical moment for Tesla."
"1406710","1409190"," I want to show you one other thing that I wanted to show you. "
"1409350","1410730"," I was talking about Amazon yesterday."
"1410730","1413550"," I wanted to show you guys."
"1415010","1417550"," Amazon trade for for a year, okay?"
"1419630","1421550"," And I want to show you this case. "
"1421590","1426690"," So Amazon is kind of you get this trades back in July, right?"
"1427390","1429650"," And you've got Amazon just following this trade right here."
"1430030","1433210"," And yesterday, I don't know why the charts looking like this here."
"1433570","1436790"," Maybe I was looking at it on another another platform here. "
"1437570","1440790"," What I wanted to show you yesterday was."
"1442070","1444850"," I don't know why my charts looking like shit this morning."
"1446030","1447010"," See if I can make this. "
"1448650","1450410"," See if we can do this a little bit better."
"1451250","1452790"," And this is the bear trade."
"1453710","1456230"," I want to show you guys what the bears are thinking here. "
"1456910","1458010"," And last night."
"1460650","1462290"," Into the clothes last night."
"1463030","1464710"," If you're looking at this trade here, right?"
"1464710","1466270"," This is pretty bearish, right?"
"1466750","1467950"," This is pretty bearish. "
"1468130","1470230"," And I think the bears are looking for that."
"1470670","1471590"," That drop."
"1471930","1473970"," I think the bear point of view is. "
"1475550","1479230"," That you haven't you haven't able to break out and that ultimately."
"1480110","1482030"," The tag is back down here again."
"1483310","1487210"," And you can see this as well playing out on Apple. "
"1487930","1490410"," I posed the question last night on."
"1491230","1491510"," Twitter."
"1492710","1494730"," That you would possibly see. "
"1495510","1499570"," You saw this in Apple last night to you'd see that same kind of a drop come down."
"1500170","1504070"," I posed the question last night that we had a we that stealth correction."
"1504070","1506350"," Everybody's talking about maybe we had that stealth correction. "
"1507010","1507850"," Market wide."
"1508750","1512090"," And maybe the trade this into January March is."
"1512690","1516670"," You could see the tickers that are holding up the indexes. "
"1518250","1519390"," Pull back, right?"
"1519390","1519650"," Correct."
"1519650","1522290"," Let's say you see the major tickers that are holding up the market."
"1522290","1523030"," They pull back. "
"1524070","1525510"," They trade down."
"1525970","1529670"," The indexes end up trading down the specifically NASDAQ spy."
"1530710","1533670"," And yet you'll see beaten down tickers rising. "
"1534930","1537670"," While the indexes index, let's say the indexes are falling."
"1538590","1540930"," The major tickers that are holding it up are falling."
"1542210","1548770"," Yet you see stability or slight increases in tickers that have been beaten down to their bottoms. "
"1549750","1554950"," So I don't know how that into play works out into the new year, but I'm fascinated by it for"
"1554950","1557290"," the end of the day today and into Monday."
"1561930","1567710"," Well, you know, it's not necessarily a bear flag, but these are the tickers that are holding the"
"1567710","1568150"," market up."
"1568190","1570470"," These are the tickers that have held the market up since May. "
"1571050","1572230"," And let's look at the spy real quick."
"1572670","1575850"," I don't think I can show it better on the spy than I can on."
"1579390","1581030"," I think I can show it better. "
"1582170","1582250"," Yeah."
"1583430","1584790"," So we take, we get rid of this."
"1586270","1588430"," So if you look back here, right, this is April. "
"1589110","1593950"," And really on April 16th and May 7th."
"1594750","1596470"," We had this role moment here, right?"
"1596470","1600650"," And the ES is really kind of just traded sideways."
"1601150","1602450"," We've had all time highs, right?"
"1602810","1605350"," But let's say we get all time highs, but we're still trading sideways. "
"1605770","1608010"," We're not trading on this larger move."
"1608670","1613770"," So do you have this capitulation move over here for the indexes, right?"
"1614330","1620130"," And we've got this nice, we've got this nice little move down here to 405 or 425 down here."
"1620510","1621830"," You have the indexes fall. "
"1621830","1627290"," Yeah, you don't see much movement out of, or you see some capitulation, maybe like a PayPal or a"
"1627290","1628390"," square or something in this movement."
"1629030","1630090"," Everything's now in line."
"1630490","1634910"," They kind of wrap it all up and we move forward from there. "
"1635090","1636790"," We actually ended up having a pretty decent year."
"1637130","1645790"," It ends up giving the ability for the forecasts for 2022 where we're making 14% or 12% or"
"1645790","1651810"," making that 14 or 12% from a nice bottom over here at 425, 400, something like that."
"1651810","1657230"," So I'm interested to see what JPM puts out there this morning for their collar. "
"1657630","1659930"," What are their projections for the lows on the year?"
"1660170","1662990"," Pay attention as I move forward, you got two minutes left until the bell."
"1663530","1665570"," I wish you all a great morning."
"1666870","1671290"," I will be signing off at this moment right now with you. "
"1673190","1674370"," Let's do a weekend video."
"1674470","1679410"," Yeah, I'm going to try to put a weekend video out on Sunday and we'll call it 11 a.m."
"1679490","1680570"," right now unless something changes."
"1680570","1683890"," Okay, 11 a.m. so you guys can watch football at one o'clock. "
"1684190","1685790"," It'll be 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time."
"1687610","1689150"," Yeah, you guys all have a great morning."
"1690170","1694990"," If anything crazy happens this morning on the bell, we can watch the bell together if you want. "
"1695670","1699150"," We can watch real quick before I before I sign off here this morning."
"1700750","1702990"," I don't know what this line is right here."
"1703590","1707570"," I don't know where this line came from. "
"1707570","1709150"," But we can we can watch the."
"1711970","1712970"," This is weird, right?"
"1713250","1714850"," I'm getting some real weirdness right now."
"1716390","1717110"," Fair and great. "
"1717130","1718370"," Is that 62 today?"
"1718650","1719950"," That's good news blood blood stuff."
"1720710","1721510"," Thanks to all of you."
"1721630","1722150"," Happy New Year. "
"1722230","1723490"," I hope you guys have all had a great new year."
"1724450","1728770"," We'll watch this open here in the next 15 seconds live together and see what what happens."
"1728990","1732350"," I don't know what's happening with with my thing here. "
"1732390","1733610"," I'll try to reset it."
"1733870","1735370"," See why it's acting so wonky."
"1738070","1739310"," Getting some weirdness. "
"1741250","1742770"," We'll see what happens here in the bell."
"1748390","1749550"," It might help right there."
"1750430","1753630"," So my expectation is that we trade up even if we trade down at the bell. "
"1753810","1757830"," Let's say we trade down for a momentary like weakness."
"1758310","1761750"," I still my expectation is that we're trading up today to 480."
"1762610","1765670"," I'd like to see if that matter of fact I'm going to open up right now the. "
"1766710","1768010"," I want to open up my."
"1768730","1772490"," I want to see if that trade is still on spy effect."
"1775750","1777890"," What looked like a trade yesterday at the close. "
"1779650","1781110"," It looked like there was a."
"1782130","1802990"," Yeah, it"
"1802990","1804470"," looks like the trade still on this morning."
"1805490","1806190"," So we'll see."
"1810040","1814060"," There's some build up in 475 P's right off the opening bells. "
"1814340","1816260"," Malgos are hitting the 475's."
"1816620","1819720"," But there's there's strong power on 4 79 480."
"1820620","1825600"," So my my you guys what you guys are following me in that when I open up my. "
"1825940","1827420"," Let me open up my trade real quick."
"1829520","1831280"," Because I think we're going to print that."
"1831840","1833200"," I think we're going to print that. "
"1833580","1839630"," I think we're going to print that."
"1839630","1852260"," I think we're"
"1852260","1853740"," going to print that 4 79 480."
"1856040","1856880"," Call spread. "
"1857700","1859200"," I think that's the target for today."
"1865160","1867460"," Now I sold out of any calls of the day."
"1868020","1869040"," I want to say on Thursday. "
"1870380","1874380"," And then I bought some for 79 480."
"1875620","1879100"," Cook my book book all spreads for today expiry."
"1879100","1881720"," And I'm sitting on. "
"1882060","1882660"," Oh shit."
"1882860","1883420"," I have to look at my."
"1883860","1884420"," I've got. "
"1886780","1888260"," Jesus, I got to make sure I'm."
"1889560","1891080"," Yeah, so my my."
"1892640","1896020"," My spy for what do I have here. "
"1897240","1900780"," I've got January 3rd for 60 P's on spy."
"1901120","1902520"," And I'll probably add more to them today."
"1902960","1905940"," This is more of a market hedge just in case we end up burning up. "
"1905940","1910320"," The bears the bears have a point where we're at a resistance point in the market."
"1910320","1912800"," You can't say that we're not even if we're continuing to go up."
"1913220","1914900"," We are at a we're at a top right now. "
"1915580","1918880"," So you can see that we've traded sideways for five days."
"1919860","1922820"," So there has to be some resolution either look above."
"1923320","1928860"," And we trade down or we keep trading sideways and we keep moving down until we hit the 20 in"
"1928860","1929120"," the 50. "
"1931040","1936260"," Other than the market forces that are forcing us to the pennant for 480 or 4 79 480."
"1937780","1940420"," We should we should you know we should trade back at some point."
"1941440","1944740"," So I've got a market hedge on for some safety. "
"1945360","1950140"," I've got to spread that it doesn't really matter what happens today as long as we trade to 4 79"
"1950140","1950540"," 480."
"1951460","1952980"," They are they were 10 bucks each."
"1953840","1955820"," And then I've got Tesla calls. "
"1956640","1958380"," I'm going to check on Tesla next."
"1959380","1960920"," I'm going to do this on another computer."
"1965500","1968860"," And that's a bet on us on Tesla trading up and over. "
"1969680","1971240"," Because I'll be honest with you."
"1971860","1975300"," If if Tesla doesn't trade up and over today."
"1978580","1982340"," Tomorrow the future the future doesn't look good for Tesla. "
"1985280","1988820"," We're already up we're already up eight right now and Tesla that's good to see."
"1990740","1993920"," But the future doesn't look good for Tesla if we don't trade up and over."
"1995040","1998460"," What is it 11 I think it's 11 20 it could be running that. "
"2000440","2001240"," We'll closer."
"2001640","2004860"," Yeah, we have to trade above 11 20 today it's it's critical."
"2005620","2007860"," It's not so trades above that this this morning. "
"2008640","2010540"," So if you guys have any questions for me at this point."
"2020080","2023440"," Yeah, RCL calls were up 300% open."
"2025720","2027880"," We look at RCL real quick. "
"2034840","2036040"," Oh hell yeah."
"2037080","2038680"," Hell yeah RCL."
"2039200","2040760"," Yeah, that was all bullshit yesterday. "
"2041280","2046480"," We were talking yesterday about like we're just so we saw we saw we know that the calls are coming"
"2046480","2052280"," in yesterday and then literally like five minutes after someone knew better."
"2052280","2058040"," There was just this like this like cacophony of you can't buy RCL."
"2058659","2064139"," You can't you this is we have to get out of our shorts first before you buy RCL. "
"2064580","2066199"," We want on the RCL trade."
"2066639","2072980"," That was probably like a GS was on the RCL trade and JPM wasn't it was really hilarious to see"
"2072980","2073679"," that yesterday."
"2077420","2084060"," Yeah, the RCL trade was in that the RCL trade was was you know, you know, it's funny because the"
"2084060","2085760"," RCL trade was similar to the MU trade. "
"2086239","2093659"," You've got it coming out the Nancy Pelosi bot at bottom you and then you've got M you just ripping"
"2093659","2098240"," and then you've got CNBC trying to temper the temper the Nancy Pelosi trade."
"2098240","2103200"," You can see you can see the Kabuki theater and how stupid most of this shit is."
"2103780","2108080"," You can see how stupid and just the pure utter stupidity in the market. "
"2109200","2114000"," Yeah, it's just straight Kabuki theater and it's like who's got more money to push whatever story"
"2114000","2114580"," they can push."
"2115960","2116720"," There we go."
"2117020","2120040"," The spy the spy the spy the spy trade spot. "
"2120260","2124940"," So the spy the spy trade is printing right now that we'd be called out here and closed yesterday."
"2128320","2129580"," This is hilarious."
"2130780","2134140"," Always love seeing this stupid shit like they would I see stuff like this. "
"2134480","2140820"," It's like I got to I got to go on Twitter and repost that trade for the close yesterday."
"2141540","2142940"," Is Joe donut around?"
"2143460","2144520"," Is he checking out his calls?"
"2148360","2149200"," Too funny."
"2156110","2158650"," Yeah, got more spreads for 10 cents. "
"2159390","2159850"," Yeah."
"2160830","2164390"," Yeah, there's a there should be a grind higher today."
"2164950","2167690"," I'm I'm going to keep hedging here as we go up. "
"2167810","2171890"," Hopefully we can add to my position and hold it."
"2171890","2174190"," And if I have to roll from the third into the fifth, I will."
"2174490","2176950"," But I do see us being weak into Monday. "
"2177550","2179810"," Do any of you see us being strong on Monday?"
"2180530","2182670"," Or like I should rephrase it."
"2183190","2187050"," Do you think that we open at a lower price on Monday than when we close today?"
"2189390","2190810"," You guys have an open up book map."
"2191190","2194430"," Okay, give me just a second and I will open up book map. "
"2195070","2196230"," Give me just a moment here."
"2197650","2204890"," And then I'm going to sign off here by 10 a.m. And hold on here."
"2210310","2213890"," You can't I don't think that you can buy spreads expiring today. "
"2214410","2218970"," You might be able to on your on your broker, but I don't think that you can buy same day"
"2218970","2219370"," spreads."
"2220730","2222890"," On the spy at this point."
"2222910","2225550"," I think I think you had to buy them before the close yesterday. "
"2225790","2226630"," I could be wrong."
"2226970","2227530"," No man."
"2227570","2228010"," I think you can. "
"2228470","2231470"," I don't normally I normally don't buy spreads same day."
"2232350","2234270"," But I thought you could only buy them on Thursday."
"2234710","2235450"," Maybe you can buy them today. "
"2235750","2236710"," I don't normally."
"2237030","2241450"," I try to capture them with red clothes, especially for like selling down into a close."
"2242010","2243750"," I'll buy some spreads the day before. "
"2246050","2246830"," Okay, hold on here."
"2246930","2247650"," We're going to look up."
"2248550","2250530"," We're going to bring up some stuff for you guys this morning. "
"2253110","2253930"," Hang tight here."
"2259540","2260760"," You guys want to see a book map?"
"2269910","2270870"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"2278310","2282870"," I'm interested to buy interested to go on on Monday at the open. "
"2288860","2292700"," I'm interested to long a bunch of stocks on Monday."
"2301170","2302710"," Let's see if we can get this rolling here."
"2302890","2303670"," What do you guys want to see?"
"2303750","2306870"," You guys want to start on spy or do you guys want to see this morning?"
"2313180","2314480"," Yeah, I got put map running right now. "
"2315200","2316280"," What do you guys want to see first?"
"2316280","2322260"," Okay, so I'll start with spy and then we'll I'll start with spy and then we'll move to."
"2323880","2328860"," You guys want to see coin base real quick or you guys want to see a Bitcoin real quick."
"2337120","2338280"," Let's see if I can. "
"2340020","2346140"," I usually try to buy by spreads the day before on like the day before expiry, especially for"
"2346140","2346740"," selling down."
"2346740","2352040"," If there's like a real nasty sell down into the clothes, I'll try to get them on the dirt cheap."
"2353380","2354040"," Let's see. "
"2354220","2362560"," We'll start with spy here and we're going to add."
"2363060","2363920"," We're going to add one."
"2365260","2366500"," I don't know why. "
"2366700","2367180"," You know, it's weird."
"2369000","2375220"," The support tells me that the hero indicator, if I save my desktop, I don't have to keep adding it,"
"2375280","2378420"," but you can see here that I continually have to keep adding it."
"2380760","2386900"," So I'll start with the spy. "
"2387180","2392040"," Then we're going to do we're going to see where the price targets are on the spy this morning."
"2395080","2397480"," You can see the price target right 480."
"2398880","2405480"," There's some light resistance at 478, but ultimately the price target, you can see that we have way"
"2405480","2411180"," more buyers than sellers on the spy this morning and you're more than likely going to see that"
"2411180","2412640"," throughout today. "
"2412640","2417120"," You will wind up seeing substantial buyers on the spy today."
"2419280","2423920"," If we get up to that 479, 480 mark today, we're going to print that."
"2424300","2428740"," Those spreads are going to print, I think, 900%, something like that. "
"2432440","2433460"," Yeah, you know, it's weird."
"2433640","2439120"," I do save my workspace every time and they told me that."
"2439120","2446600"," They said, if you save your workspace every time, it'll save, but it worked on 7.1, but 7.2,"
"2446640","2447660"," it's not working for me. "
"2448400","2453700"," Maybe I need to update 7.2. 7.1, I had no problem saving the hero indicator, but I'm having"
"2453700","2454120"," problems."
"2455400","2460380"," I updated to 7.2 last week, and I've been having problems ever since."
"2461840","2462860"," So I don't know why. "
"2463280","2465380"," I don't know what I'm doing here, what I'm doing wrong here."
"2465380","2471060"," So you guys can see here right at the bat this morning."
"2472420","2476300"," Hero indicators off the charts, off the charts with call flow. "
"2477020","2479380"," You can see that we have more buyers than sellers."
"2479920","2482860"," This is all very positive for the spy as we open the day."
"2483480","2488580"," You can see that we have almost no resistance until you get to 480. "
"2489200","2490700"," That's my price target for today."
"2491040","2494620"," This is ultimately what our price target was on Sunday."
"2494620","2497220"," We talked about tagging 478. "
"2497500","2500260"," We talked about the pin on 480 for Friday."
"2501640","2506620"," We've had some volatility in the overnight sessions."
"2507180","2510480"," It really is the only place that you can catch a drop. "
"2511400","2514720"," And I expect that same thing to happen into Monday."
"2515160","2522040"," You'll see that volatility kick in over the weekend where they can do that."
"2522940","2524060"," It's low liquidity. "
"2526160","2529880"," Because of all the buying that's going on, that's why we haven't had much volatility."
"2530560","2531680"," So my price target for today."
"2532380","2537580"," I'm going to check out here in a little bit and I'm going to check back and probably going to"
"2537580","2540840"," set an alert from my phone on my email for 479. "
"2541460","2543320"," And I'll take my money and run it for 479."
"2544980","2548220"," I'm not going to wait for 480 if I can get like 2, 3, 4, 500%."
"2548220","2552720"," It paid for all my all my fuck ups this week. "
"2552740","2555780"," Sorry for swearing all my mess ups with Tesla and MU."
"2556120","2561620"," I had a foray into MU and Tesla and ended up just I stopped trading."
"2561640","2562360"," MU was bored. "
"2562760","2566000"," I was like the more markets boring and then I bought Tesla yesterday."
"2566280","2567280"," You should have waited for 480."
"2568400","2570460"," I'll check on it here at some point this morning. "
"2571000","2573440"," So we're going to look into Tesla at this point."
"2574300","2575940"," So that spy looks good."
"2576160","2578200"," Heat map on spy looks good right now. "
"2578200","2580940"," The map right now is matching up to everything I told you before the market opened."
"2582040","2583720"," So I'm going to believe in that for today."
"2584140","2585800"," You might expect some quick drops. "
"2586500","2589080"," So if any of you guys are in just calls, you might."
"2589420","2598540"," I would be jumping in and out of calls today rather than holding them to 478 or 479 or 480."
"2598960","2603220"," I would take it for the run and then sell out and buy back in because the market maker is"
"2603220","2603880"," going to drain them. "
"2603880","2609720"," The spreads are going to drain the intrinsic value that's left, whatever's left them right now, the"
"2609720","2610400"," pennies that are left."
"2614570","2615990"," Let's take a look at Tesla."
"2619330","2619810"," Yep. "
"2620690","2623150"," You can see that same money is down below at 1050."
"2623410","2624950"," That same smart money is down here."
"2625830","2627630"," We'll add the hero indicator again. "
"2629070","2634470"," I got to really talk to find out why."
"2639370","2640610"," We'll check the hero indicator."
"2641410","2642330"," And it's the same story. "
"2642950","2645770"," Is there a chance today that we that's short."
"2646230","2647310"," That's short coverage."
"2647510","2651450"," There's a chance that short covering ended on Tesla on the 20th or 21st. "
"2652350","2654550"," We would talk about that happening back then."
"2655250","2658710"," Or in the 12th thing was the 12th of the 21st that the shorts would have to cover at some"
"2658710","2658950"," point."
"2659530","2660850"," They may have already done that. "
"2661230","2662370"," These may be new shorts."
"2663030","2667270"," If these are not new shorts, they only haven't until ended and ended today to cover."
"2667950","2669330"," And I'm going to show you a little bit higher. "
"2669930","2670910"," We want to be breaking."
"2671150","2672170"," This is what we want to break through."
"2673190","2674690"," See that 1120 up there?"
"2675510","2677830"," We need to break through this cell right here today. "
"2678970","2682190"," Like just murder this grind up here and break through 1120."
"2682610","2684370"," That's my hope for end of the day today."
"2689890","2690970"," Spy isn't fine. "
"2694110","2695870"," The unloved stepchild index."
"2697450","2699630"," And actually why I get strapped back to the open."
"2700090","2700510"," Yeah. "
"2700910","2703730"," You know, I, you know, I always make fun of Russell too."
"2703810","2705010"," I'm always like, I hate this index."
"2705290","2705870"," I hate it the most. "
"2706030","2706870"," And I honestly do."
"2707290","2710190"," I like trading the Russell back and forth."
"2710890","2711270"," Bull and bear. "
"2712230","2717490"," But, you know, we all know that there's no possible way that the Russell should ever have traded up"
"2717490","2718290"," at like it did."
"2718770","2723390"," And in the time of COVID, that was a, that was a handout given to us businesses."
"2725030","2725850"," Was it proper?"
"2726310","2727030"," Yeah, I think it was. "
"2727330","2731050"," I don't, I don't want to see, I don't want to see us in a war or World War or"
"2731050","2733130"," our economy to crash during COVID."
"2733590","2736810"," And we should prop up our business if we can."
"2738670","2740630"," Do I think the training wheels should come off our businesses?"
"2743350","2744290"," Probably not yet. "
"2744930","2746370"," I think that way they should."
"2747610","2751150"," We should, we should allow bankruptcy to take place and closures."
"2751850","2753150"," I just don't think it's the time is right. "
"2753270","2755730"," I think the time is maybe 2023."
"2756830","2760690"," The training wheels come off for small businesses, mid-sized businesses."
"2761770","2765270"," You guys don't want to see, you guys don't want that to happen right now. "
"2766010","2769770"," Now, if you guys are American, you don't, you can be very liberal and whatever."
"2769770","2775610"," I know that some of you all want to see the world burn, but in reality, I don't know how"
"2775610","2777290"," many of you have been to a third world country."
"2778290","2782090"," It's not as nice as it's portrayed in movies and TV. "
"2783750","2785230"," I'm not talking about tourist areas."
"2785470","2789750"," I'm talking about, you know, real bad places and you don't want to live that life."
"2792110","2792970"," Can we look at AMD?"
"2793750","2794050"," Yeah, sure. "
"2795810","2799310"," Yeah, you'll see, you're going to see VIX climb."
"2799570","2800350"," You'll see VIX climb."
"2801190","2806250"," So you guys, you guys don't, I wouldn't, I don't know if I'd correlate VIX to the spy right now. "
"2807010","2810630"," The VIX should climb today into Monday."
"2810970","2812930"," It happens every single year."
"2813990","2815990"," Whether the spy goes up or down, it doesn't matter. "
"2816490","2817690"," You're going to get a VIX spike."
"2818630","2823150"," One of the biggest volatile volatility weeks of the year."
"2823470","2825650"," I think Spock, I'm a noted this earlier in the week. "
"2826210","2835970"," They showed a chart that showed that the biggest spike in VIX is the 53rd week of the year."
"2836990","2839850"," And we don't have that 53rd week this year."
"2840850","2842690"," Well, it depends on which calendar you're looking at. "
"2842690","2847870"," If you're looking at a, depends on, so when you're doing data points, there are two calendars."
"2848270","2850270"," There's a world calendar and then the U.S. calendar."
"2851210","2853050"," And you want to be plotting on a 53 week calendar. "
"2853870","2855910"," There's a little bit more complex than I wouldn't need to be talking about here."
"2856110","2866090"," But on the 53rd week of a data point calendar, the VIX volatility is the highest it"
"2866090","2867050"," is of the entire year."
"2867050","2872790"," So the implication would be if we don't have that 53rd week this year, which we don't in the U "
"2872790","2880710",".S., but on a dot plot, it translates to, not a dot plot, but a data plot, it translates to"
"2880710","2882610"," the 31st and the 1st. "
"2883350","2884390"," You guys all know that?"
"2884930","2891050"," You guys all know that when you make data charts that they're plotted in 53 weeks and not 52?"
"2891050","2897760"," Looking like she's going to puke."
"2898360","2900160"," Seems like spy looking the same way."
"2900400","2900520"," Yeah. "
"2901000","2904020"," Okay, so I'm going to leave you with this one."
"2904080","2906940"," I'll do one more, the AMD, I'm going to do AMD for you."
"2908820","2915300"," And if you're a bear out there, all I'm going to tell you is you should be greedy and hope"
"2915300","2919740"," that you get 480 so that you can go short from a higher number. "
"2919740","2921680"," I always like the bears."
"2921920","2924060"," Bears want to be, bears want to make less money."
"2924540","2928200"," I want to make more as a bear or when I become bear, I want to be, I want to"
"2928200","2931500"," be like screaming to the tippity top and grab that top all the way down. "
"2932620","2939980"," And I want to be grabbing short at 476 or 474."
"2940420","2943600"," I want to be grabbing into like 480, 480, 25."
"2944660","2946120"," I want that nice little scream above. "
"2946120","2949220"," And then I want to, I want to rake all that cash in."
"2952080","2953200"," Yeah, AMD is looking great."
"2954120","2954840"," I like AMD. "
"2955840","2957920"," This is a good move for today is a nice start to AMD."
"2958300","2960040"," You got great support down here, 144."
"2961920","2962940"," Buyers right off the bell. "
"2963640","2964480"," Sellers are being absorbed."
"2965100","2965880"," Your price targets 160."
"2971140","2972980"," Happy New Year has been good to see you, my brother. "
"2973900","2975480"," Ben, I'll be checking in with you this week."
"2975680","2976000"," We'll have it."
"2976200","2981380"," If you have some time, I'll try to reach out to you over the weekend. "
"2981980","2983200"," We'll let you enjoy your weekend."
"2983200","2986780"," As soon as the new year stuff is over, we'll get together and talk."
"2988920","2991680"," The options market does not close early today. "
"2992320","2993220"," That's a great question."
"2995060","2996100"," Happy New Year has been."
"2999300","3001180"," Yeah, I'll do NQ real quick for you. "
"3001540","3007300"," And I'll do, I'll do the cues and I'll do spy once more before you wrap this up."
"3007820","3009900"," And I'll do the IWM for you guys as well."
"3010500","3011280"," So AMD looks great. "
"3011280","3012100"," I like AMD."
"3012900","3015020"," If you buy the dip at 144, if you break."
"3015280","3017060"," So how do you trade AMD today, right?"
"3017460","3018520"," You buy any dips at 144. "
"3019420","3022200"," You know that if you break through 144 that you cut your losses."
"3022200","3025300"," You know that your price targets 160, right?"
"3025480","3027300"," Just easy, simple, right?"
"3027480","3030180"," Keep things simple and trade that way."
"3032200","3032600"," IWM. "
"3036930","3038210"," Look at IWM real quick."
"3038270","3039570"," We'll look at the cues real quick."
"3040170","3041470"," We'll head back to the spy. "
"3042270","3044030"," And then we'll get out of here for you guys."
"3044230","3045670"," Yeah, I'll do Apple for you."
"3046030","3047230"," And I'll do Bitcoin too. "
"3048010","3049130"," I can't be here all morning."
"3050830","3052950"," I've been here, I'm here with you guys all day every day."
"3052990","3054070"," I got to trade myself too. "
"3054510","3057410"," I haven't done the, I haven't done the trading that I want to do."
"3057690","3062390"," And I haven't set my system up yet to trade properly next to you."
"3063370","3065650"," So I don't like my trading this week. "
"3067250","3071690"," And I really want to be here to show you guys where to make entry and where to take exit."
"3072950","3074310"," IWM is the same thing."
"3074910","3077110"," The ultimate price target at IWM is 240. "
"3078070","3078730"," We know that."
"3082280","3085460"," We do have slightly more sellers than buyers in IWM."
"3087520","3088960"," This is more grind sideways. "
"3089940","3093280"," I can show the heroin indicator if you want to see if you got some calls coming in."
"3093280","3103980"," Oh, does"
"3103980","3104280"," that work?"
"3106020","3108940"," I'm at immigration add-ons."
"3109660","3112400"," Wrong one. "
"3117040","3118940"," Getting some walkiness here."
"3120940","3123640"," I delete the hero indicator from here."
"3125140","3136140"," Looks more"
"3136140","3137060"," like grinding here. "
"3137820","3140840"," Here indicator is going to take a minute or two forward to kick in, I think."
"3147440","3157000"," Got some resistance right now at 2.29.50. If we grind higher here today and get above 2 "
"3157000","3162820",".28. You're probably going to see a squeeze on IWM, whatever a squeeze, you know, however it's"
"3162820","3163600"," considered a squeeze."
"3165460","3167160"," This might get pinned to end today. "
"3167420","3169520"," I'm interested maybe to take a trade here in a day."
"3169520","3172580"," Even if the market is weak on Monday."
"3173180","3178140"," Maybe I'll take a trade here at the end of the day and then maybe add to it on Monday. "
"3178400","3179260"," If it goes down."
"3180120","3182040"," This whole trade interests me."
"3182660","3183520"," So IWM thing is. "
"3186680","3187880"," I'll do apple real quick."
"3195930","3199370"," If there was one index that, yeah, we've already been down the road."
"3199590","3202850"," We've really beaten up Russell Crow here. "
"3207200","3210760"," And, you know, if I wanted to see an index pullback before."
"3211540","3213500"," Like I can see the S&P pulling back."
"3215240","3215760"," Easily. "
"3218260","3220220"," Oh, yeah, see apples got."
"3220800","3223460"," You've got monstrous buyers and apple here."
"3224220","3225960"," I'll be conscious of that in apple. "
"3226340","3229360"," You've got a wall on apple to above here at 180."
"3230560","3230960"," And then 190."
"3232260","3234680"," You've got people buying, buying apples today. "
"3235260","3236260"," I expect that too."
"3236420","3237480"," You're going to expect to see."
"3238600","3240340"," You're going to expect to see. "
"3241720","3243780"," Apple be the market's hedge."
"3244120","3245320"," You guys all understand that, right?"
"3245740","3247200"," The markets to apple hedge still."
"3249340","3251200"," Here indicator is good on apple. "
"3252040","3253260"," Might be a nice trade for today."
"3253940","3255720"," Take a 178 C or something."
"3256980","3257700"," I like the apple trade. "
"3258580","3259840"," Apple is the market hedge."
"3259840","3266280"," And then until until the Fed stops buying apple bonds."
"3267160","3268340"," That's my dumb down version. "
"3268340","3271880"," Actually, the hero indicator is coming in negative on apple at this point."
"3272640","3274840"," But until J."
"3274980","3278320"," Paul comes out and says, you know, we're not buying apple bonds."
"3278700","3284260"," And then I'm telling you, the day they don't show up to that that auction, with that day they don't"
"3284260","3284960"," show up that auction. "
"3285580","3287440"," Good luck because the market's going to burn."
"3287440","3292020"," I think everybody knows that, including J."
"3292180","3294260"," So they can't take the foot off the gas."
"3294640","3295540"," We know they can't. "
"3295800","3297920"," We know right now they can't take the foot off the gas."
"3298240","3301760"," And if anything, if they were going to take the foot off the gas, why not do it in March?"
"3302000","3304080"," Why not do it in July of the dog days of summer?"
"3306160","3307900"," So yeah, we got more buyers and sellers."
"3308200","3311500"," We do have a lot of negative options coming in an apple. "
"3312080","3317720"," I'm going to assume that the bears are thinking that if they put their hedges on apple, that's the"
"3317720","3322900"," way to trade or to hedge the market is on apple."
"3323500","3324420"," I think that's the wrong trade."
"3325580","3329340"," Personally, there are more speculative stocks that have been holding the market up. "
"3329900","3333740"," That would be a better individual ticker hedge against the market."
"3334500","3337220"," I'm not going to say which ones, but there are."
"3341240","3342140"," Good morning, everybody. "
"3342800","3344200"," Yeah, I expect Tesla to go up today."
"3344620","3346800"," You guys have to listen to what I'm saying to you about Tesla."
"3346800","3348900"," You only have two choices in Tesla. "
"3349320","3357960"," Tesla has to go above 11 20 this morning or the flight down is a broken staircase."
"3360040","3362440"," So it's do or die for Tesla."
"3362980","3365040"," And I don't know if the shorts are off. "
"3365140","3370480"," If the shorts aren't off in Tesla and they're waiting for the last 45 minutes of the cash market"
"3370480","3373860"," today, then you're going to see a face ripper at some point, right?"
"3374160","3375460"," We've all been waiting all week long."
"3375460","3378700"," I think a bunch of us out there have been waiting all week long for that."
"3380320","3381740"," Looks like a Bitcoin real quick. "
"3401810","3403250"," No, I don't want the one inch Bitcoin."
"3406250","3407590"," I want Bitcoin."
"3410330","3411610"," On BTC, right?"
"3415620","3416980"," To the US dollar, I think. "
"3418360","3419260"," Is that the one that I want?"
"3420360","3421560"," BTC to US dollar."
"3427590","3428810"," Is it US?"
"3429050","3433630"," I don't know which BTS or which one it is."
"3433890","3435330"," I forget. "
"3436010","3437050"," Good morning, Joe."
"3447160","3450900"," So what am I talking about when I talk about, yeah, this is Bitcoin."
"3451680","3452460"," This is the Bitcoin chart. "
"3453340","3456300"," You guys want to see where support and resistance is a Bitcoin."
"3456980","3458380"," All you market bears out there."
"3458940","3459300"," Where's Quinn?"
"3460100","3461400"," Someone get Quinn in here. "
"3462940","3466460"," Quinn needs to know where we are with Bitcoin."
"3469750","3472290"," All you market bears out there want to see this for sure."
"3480030","3482350"," You guys all want to see the ugly. "
"3483690","3486530"," We'll give this a minute to load up and then we'll go back to the."
"3487970","3489590"," Dx feed for cash market."
"3494840","3495900"," Much as sickos. "
"3498620","3499860"," So Apple bad."
"3499860","3501040"," Okay, so."
"3502800","3504600"," I'll talk to you about Apple real quick. "
"3505840","3506320"," So."
"3508200","3514720"," A lot of bears there say they say something like, well, I want to short the market, but I can't"
"3514720","3516700"," short the hedge fund or I can't short the indexes."
"3516700","3518460"," You can see that they've stayed up well. "
"3518840","3520520"," We've had this stealth correction, right?"
"3521080","3523840"," So you get all these bears that are, they're shorting the wrong instruments."
"3523880","3524900"," They're shorting spy."
"3526060","3528860"," Shorting NASDAQ and you can see that none of that shit's gone down. "
"3530460","3535220"," And so the simple thing to do is to look at, let's say, Apple and say."
"3536180","3540140"," Well, I'm going to short Apple because that's certainly coming down."
"3541180","3541960"," And in reality. "
"3543520","3547080"," Some of you guys missed the news in 2020."
"3548280","3552960"," In April, I think, or May of 2020, maybe March somewhere in there."
"3552960","3557900"," When quantity of quantitative easing was turned on. "
"3558740","3562420"," It was turned on in the form of buying Apple bonds."
"3563160","3565200"," Corporate debt, right?"
"3566280","3567540"," Interbank corporate debt."
"3568260","3568640"," Debt bonds. "
"3569780","3571200"," And they Apple was one of those companies."
"3571600","3572800"," There was a short list of them."
"3573480","3574520"," Those companies. "
"3575120","3578500"," And sure enough, those are the companies that are holding up our stock market."
"3579380","3586720"," So unless they stop doing a stop that easing, then there's no reason to short Apple."
"3587060","3588120"," Apple will never correct. "
"3588760","3589840"," That's where the money is."
"3590080","3591460"," That's where the bank's money is."
"3591960","3593080"," You guys understand all that?"
"3597590","3598890"," Yep, shorting the wrong instrument. "
"3599570","3607390"," You guys can do a Google search and look up like Apple bonds and do 2020."
"3608230","3610170"," So that you can look for the news stories."
"3611090","3612650"," When it took place in 2020. "
"3613150","3615110"," And not many people talk about that stuff."
"3615390","3617210"," Like which companies are they propping up and why?"
"3617890","3620350"," Why is Apple up, right?"
"3620570","3622870"," They're not propping up SQ square block."
"3623190","3623930"," Oh, sorry. "
"3624310","3625590"," Whatever they want to call themselves now."
"3626770","3627210"," Okay."
"3627290","3629250"," So you guys see the, you guys see support, right?"
"3629530","3630810"," 45,000, 45,000. "
"3632370","3635090"," You see resistance 49,000 on Bitcoin."
"3637050","3640900"," So we're going to get out of that feed."
"3641960","3643660"," We're going to look at the spy real quick. "
"3649980","3650800"," Oh, Nvidia, right?"
"3650960","3651600"," Someone wanted Nvidia."
"3652280","3653560"," Let me do Nvidia first."
"3658440","3659680"," I remember someone said Nvidia. "
"3662990","3663690"," We'll do Nvidia."
"3664230","3664490"," Yeah."
"3664750","3669370"," So there's certain, you know, certain companies out there that are being supported by quantitative"
"3669370","3669830"," easing. "
"3670350","3676260"," Not easing, but by bond purchases."
"3676580","3676960"," Hold on here."
"3686120","3686980"," So Nvidia looks great. "
"3687280","3689860"," You guys can see where your support and resistance is, right?"
"3690600","3694900"," You're, you've got more, you've got slightly more sellers than buyers than Nvidia."
"3695600","3700080"," You know that your support's at 2.90, 11."
"3700900","3702060"," Your price target is 320. "
"3703120","3704720"," You've got boost guys above 330."
"3705840","3711900"," Your real smart money is way down here at 2.69. You've got another band down here at 2.50."
"3712260","3714640"," 2.50, 2.70, 2.90, basically."
"3717750","3718010"," Okay. "
"3718310","3719310"," And we're going to go back to the spy."
"3719310","3722350"," And I'm going to leave you with the spy."
"3722990","3729870"," I do want to say thank you to all of you for supporting the beginnings of this channel. "
"3729870","3730790"," We just started this."
"3731290","3733070"," This is a free sub that we've begun."
"3733870","3738550"," I hope to include more participants into the sub. "
"3739050","3740850"," There's are some partnerships."
"3740930","3744430"," I'd like to do some interviews with some of your favorite traders out there."
"3744830","3749030"," I know that we've got some community members that have some long time experience. "
"3749030","3753210"," We're going to try to do some morning interviews with some of the members of this community."
"3753990","3757870"," I know that Bob and Rob and there's a Quinn and markets and mayhem."
"3758590","3766110"," There's a bunch of people that are seasoned traders, seasoned investors that we're going to do some"
"3766110","3767150"," morning interviews with. "
"3767590","3772230"," So we'll have, we'll have a show in the morning where we interview some traders that you know,"
"3772290","3773770"," traders from inside of our community."

"3917400","3922380"," with those classes so that they're always available to traders for free, especially new retail"
"3922380","3922800"," traders. "
"3922800","3929720"," I know that people think that retail traders are going to go away because of the money flow ending"
"3929720","3931840"," and because of market getting tighter."
"3932440","3940800"," But in reality, the reality is that us as Americans are having to turn to create our own wealth and"
"3940800","3941800"," our own retirements."
"3941800","3949720"," You can't rely upon having a retirement fund anymore, a pension plan or a significance 401k plan"
"3949720","3951540"," that takes care of us as we get older. "
"3952160","3960820"," So you do see people turning to stock investing in stock trading and hopefully we can put make"
"3960820","3962800"," something free for the masses."
"3968100","3971680"," Yeah, so that's all I want to say to you guys hope we can have a free sub out there."
"3972480","3974880"," Hopefully it's it helps new traders. "
"3975080","3979900"," Hopefully, hopefully it's there's some of you away from, because I know that it's like I paid for"
"3979900","3981900"," subs or like 600 bucks 1000 bucks."
"3982260","3988380"," I go inside of a discord and everyone's an asshole, right, or they're using big words, even I can't"
"3988380","3992020"," understand I understand a lot, but then I'm like, wait a minute now I understand what they're"
"3992020","3994340"," saying, but they're still being."
"3995780","4000860"," What they're still not giving a decisive answer as to what's going to happen. "
"4001440","4004980"," And then I see them come out later and say, whoo, I made all this money on this trade."
"4005180","4012020"," I'm like, wait a minute, I remember in your earlier statements that you didn't say if you were long"
"4012020","4015340"," or short or if you bought that trade or not or sold that trade."
"4016300","4021120"," So I wonder if they're actually trading or investing it so you know, you only hear about the good"
"4021120","4022640"," trades you don't hear about the bad trades. "
"4023320","4029480"," You guys you guys know that I always post my trades before I make them I'm known for this on"
"4029480","4031880"," Twitter like I don't I don't delete any of my posts."

"4044760","4045040"," trades. "
"4046280","4047720"," You just met that person."
"4048580","4053560"," Okay, so I appreciate all the support I appreciate you guys interacting with me."
"4054040","4060020"," We had a great lives we did a we did a zoom call last Sunday was hilarious it devolved into"
"4060020","4061720"," general debauchery of course. "
"4062400","4066540"," And I was in some pain afterwards, but that was still a fun time."
"4067580","4071380"," As a matter of fact I haven't had a bare sense I was so hungover from that experience."
"4071380","4074500"," So I had a great time with all of you out there. "
"4075320","4077300"," I'm not going to do a shot with you today."
"4077540","4082680"," I was so hungover still from last Sunday that you're not getting the shot from me today."
"4083020","4084200"," I'll drink a tea with you. "
"4085300","4094380"," But otherwise expect a live stream on Sunday 11 a.m. We're going to the focus of Sunday is going"
"4094380","4096640"," to be a basket of stocks."
"4096640","4101640"," I'm going to have a basket of stocks for you to to chart out and I'll chart out for you"
"4101640","4104240"," on trading view so that you can have access to them."
"4105040","4107939"," You can chart them yourselves set alerts for yourselves. "
"4108180","4110160"," I'll do somewhere between 100 to 300 stocks."
"4110580","4116600"," You guys have your stocks you're interested have like a have like one to three stocks that you want"
"4116600","4119540"," to see charted out for 2022."
"4119540","4127580"," And we'll I'll make a prediction a forecast for 2022 and we'll see how that plays out for the year"
"4127580","4128979"," if you know for way off. "
"4129460","4134939"," If we're kind in the money or not we'll try to get your input as well."
"4135600","4142460"," We can do this either through zoom so we can get some verbal interaction or even just chat box so"
"4142460","4147020"," that you guys can talk amongst each other or lend some insight as to what the prevailing."
"4147020","4153479"," What we'll talk about the prevailing thought is for 2022 and then we'll see what our view is versus"
"4153479","4157859"," the prevailing thought and do your due diligence if you have some time over the weekend. "
"4159000","4165720"," You know go back and look at what the banks project they forecast every year and see how accurate"
"4165720","4166240"," they are."
"4167020","4174720"," And I would also urge you to look at what the hedge fund talking heads do because they tend to"
"4174720","4179479"," I noticed that the hedge fund talking heads tend to be way more inaccurate."
"4179960","4183960"," They tend to be wrong or selling out of their positions. "
"4185979","4190660"," But you like the GM the JPM white papers and the GS white papers."
"4191580","4195680"," How do they compare so that when you are coming up with your."
"4196900","4201460"," Version of what your forecast is and then the last point I would leave you with is the reason why"
"4201460","4205720"," most of those forecasts are inaccurate is because you can't predict unknown news. "
"4205720","4214460"," So maybe we come back on on Sunday with what are some potential bad news moments that could take"
"4214460","4215240"," place next year."
"4216280","4224200"," Okay, so at least have those in our in our list of what you call your dead pool right."
"4225420","4228360"," Deadpool events that could possibly happen in 2022. "
"4229040","4235360"," I guess you'd talk about Ukraine talk about the presidency the Senate talk about tapering and."
"4236620","4244000"," Rates talk about maybe some mergers and acquisitions and possibly even some businesses failing"
"4244000","4245860"," right which companies could fail this year."
"4250240","4252980"," Yeah, the hedge fund virologists they're hilarious. "
"4255960","4260060"," March quarter three eight ten four twenty p.s. versus three ninety five."
"4260320","4264040"," Oh, here we go Bob Bob Walsh has some numbers here Bob."
"4264180","4265460"," Can you talk about that real quick. "
"4266980","4272400"," I'm just posted March quarter three eighty ten four fifty two."
"4272720","4279160"," Right on right on."
"4280040","4281760"," That's perfect numbers by the way. "
"4285000","4285900"," That's perfect."
"4289260","4291540"," That is some that is crazy."
"4292220","4298640"," So that is that is that's my take from that is that we're adding volatility and sideways trading"
"4298640","4302540"," three eighty ten. "
"4308840","4309300"," Wow."
"4312850","4315550"," That is some that that's some serious expansion."
"4316050","4321350"," That's the 400 number that I was talking to about earlier at the start when I said if we traded"
"4321350","4322730"," down the indexes to 400. "
"4323450","4329110"," You know and you kind of like you knocked down a couple big players two three four big players."
"4330270","4333450"," Meanwhile all the knockdown stocks would be fine."
"4337560","4339480"," So I like the range expansion. "
"4347280","4351040"," Forty three caller forty three thousand callers versus twenty three."
"4351600","4352360"," No kidding."
"4362250","4362810"," Unbelievable. "
"4363370","4364290"," I got to look up."
"4364690","4365850"," I got to look up."
"4366110","4367090"," What's the space real quick. "
"4380760","4381740"," Tight there guys."
"4415770","4417230"," Three eight ten."
"4418390","4423610"," That makes sense for that four hundred trade hundred percent that makes trade that makes sense. "
"4437870","4439470"," That is interesting."
"4479480","4481080"," Yeah that's that four hundred trade."
"4487560","4492140"," The bears must be stoked right now. "
"4496090","4497390"," Bears have to be stoked."
"4500270","4505030"," So why do I like you guys are asking why I like that I'm going to explain why I like"
"4505030","4505250"," that."
"4536660","4539280"," So no it's not necessarily bearish. "
"4541640","4544800"," What it does for me as a trader is."
"4548700","4554780"," It gives so as a trader I've made more money off of the past."
"4555840","4558200"," Two or three months then. "
"4559720","4567760"," I have in recent memory and the reason being that the trading ranges have been defined."
"4570920","4572820"," No not bad for zero dates at all."
"4573640","4576000"," I'm going to try and explain it to you like your five. "
"4579580","4588890"," So it implies that the market is going to trade sideways."
"4591570","4595270"," Now that's only the next three months right to talk in January."
"4595850","4597730"," Well what's the what's the expiry on this trade. "
"4598310","4600670"," My assumption is the expiry is the thirty first of March."
"4601570","4604470"," So to me though it doesn't look bad at all."
"4604610","4605290"," So you're talking about. "
"4607350","4609850"," You're talking about look at the numbers one more time here."
"4611790","4613670"," Where are the numbers once more."
"4614810","4621490"," So you've got a three fifty two right or excuse me a five fifty or four fifty two. "
"4624810","4628610"," Right you've got a forty nine forty nine twenty five call."
"4628610","4632930"," So you're talking about the next three months getting close to five hundred."
"4634430","4634950"," Right. "
"4635630","4636230"," Which is nice."
"4636830","4638630"," I mean if you hit if you hit five hundred."
"4639510","4640730"," That's pretty nice right. "
"4641570","4643010"," And we talked about that yesterday."
"4643650","4645490"," Where do you really expect us to go."
"4647610","4650750"," Into where do you where do you where you really expecting us. "
"4651490","4653130"," To go between now and March."
"4653130","4658730"," We talked yesterday we said do you think we're going to see between four at four eighty."
"4658870","4660850"," Do you think we're hitting five hundred the next week or two. "
"4661210","4663170"," I think we're hitting in the next three weeks."
"4664250","4666010"," Maybe we hit it in February."
"4667030","4670030"," Right late February or something if we get kick ass earnings. "
"4670830","4671850"," So that makes sense right."
"4672790","4674870"," Maybe we'll hit five hundred if we get great earnings."
"4676430","4677590"," Where's the low end though. "
"4678270","4681170"," And they made that collar down at four hundred."
"4681730","4684310"," That sounds rational to me and logical to me."
"4684450","4688370"," What it also does is it shows sideways movement for the next three months. "
"4688650","4689230"," And what does that mean."
"4689350","4692530"," It means that you have more defined trading areas."
"4694910","4696230"," So like I trade hard. "
"4696390","4699350"," I don't do a lot of you trade well with grinds higher."
"4700030","4702010"," Like if you make all time highs and you just keep grinding."
"4702810","4705570"," I don't know how you could time how to get out of your trades. "
"4706390","4710090"," That's when I start making comments people like I don't believe you actually trade."
"4710630","4714030"," Because how could you trade an all time high."
"4714570","4719410"," Stay in that trade and then know when to get out before you fall off the cliff. "
"4721730","4725790"," If you've ever done that you know that your trade fails at some point."
"4726750","4730230"," So when you have a more defined training training area then you know."
"4730750","4733670"," You kind of know where the tops are kind of where the bottoms are. "
"4734230","4736110"," And you kind of know you can trade within that."
"4736110","4743360"," I think it's bullish and bearish."
"4764490","4766750"," Yeah, no, I think you I think that they're seeing 500. "
"4767570","4770910"," I think that they see 500 for the from now until March."
"4771570","4773970"," And I think that their downside risk is to 400."
"4774470","4775070"," That's what I think. "
"4787640","4790400"," Yeah, who's good at all time highs all time highs kind of sucks."
"4791500","4792680"," That's what I'm taking from it."
"4792800","4796420"," I'm taking I'm taking from it that yes, we have a possibility of 500. "
"4796420","4798400"," And the next three months."
"4799160","4800840"," I think that's reasonable to assume."
"4801520","4804000"," I think that where's your downside risk?"
"4804140","4804840"," Where's your put wall?"
"4804980","4807260"," Well, they're saying that the put wall is now three ninety eight, right?"
"4807740","4808340"," So the same. "
"4808960","4814100"," So if you have a three ninety put wall, then your bottom should be like four."
"4815880","4817260"," Probably four twenty five."
"4830060","4835000"," That's that was my point yesterday was you guys think you're going to do five hundred in February. "
"4835000","4840560"," And then what do you think we're going to crack 600 by end of year or five sixty by end"
"4840560","4840800"," of year."
"4841720","4843100"," That's kind of a stretch."
"4843760","4844620"," I'm a I'm a bull. "
"4845360","4846900"," And I'm like, yeah, that's kind of a stretch."
"4848140","4851720"," But they are putting in for the potential to go down to 400."
"4852560","4857380"," That would imply my bet would be that they're looking for that 400 if. "
"4858960","4860860"," If we stop buying corporate bonds."
"4862300","4863240"," That would be my guess."
"4879470","4883810"," Yeah, the only thing that I'm looking for is if we tag four seventy eight four seventy nine. "
"4883970","4885450"," I'm just looking for that into the clothes today."
"4885930","4890830"," I'm going to close my spreads and then into mine."
"4891610","4893030"," I'll come back end of day. "
"4893390","4896010"," If I get if we can hopefully get up to four seventy nine four eighty."
"4896650","4900550"," I'm going to put some or add to my bearish position."
"4901390","4903030"," For a Monday being down. "
"4910560","4912780"," No, no, no, I'm not saying five sixty and a year."
"4913060","4914580"," What I'm saying is as a bull."
"4915340","4918180"," Happy New Year to all of you, by the way, happy New Year. "
"4918280","4919380"," We were talking about earlier Joe."
"4919740","4920560"," Happy New Year Joe."
"4922200","4925560"," So what I was talking to you guys about earlier was if you're bullish. "
"4926800","4929920"," You have to think to yourself where all the forecasts are."
"4930320","4931040"," They're negative."
"4931600","4937080"," Well, the mean and the mean and the median are basically we're going to be at five hundred max five"
"4937080","4937800"," twenty end of year. "
"4939640","4943420"," So that means they got to knock it down a little bit at some points, right?"
"4944120","4945420"," It also means that."
"4946700","4949440"," You know, they're not going to trade from here to five twenty end of year."
"4949860","4952880"," That would be like a straight line sideways for an entire year. "
"4953200","4954480"," There's no possible way that happens."
"4954780","4956380"," Just just based on unknown news."
"4957360","4960980"," And the point is if we're at 480 at the end of today, it's going to be close to 480. "
"4962140","4964840"," Are you taking longs into March?"
"4966400","4967780"," And what's your price target?"
"4968200","4968700"," Five twenty."
"4970380","4971320"," In a March."
"4971860","4972600"," I find that hard to believe. "
"4973340","4980440"," I believe that I believe that like in a month in a February, we hit maybe five hundred four ninety"
"4980440","4981300"," five."
"4982640","4984380"," That's called four ninety three like J."
"4984520","4984580"," P."
"4984640","4984700"," M."
"4984800","4986160"," Zen for ninety three."
"4986960","4991480"," But with a pullback like a nice strong fat pullback to four seventy four sixty. "
"4992880","4999080"," Over that time period, nice swing down, nice swing back up or a swing up and then a swing down."
