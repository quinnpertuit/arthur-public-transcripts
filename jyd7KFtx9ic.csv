"jyd7KFtx9ic","0","8000"," Hey, this is Andrew left at Sintra on research, giving you five reasons why GameStop is going to $20."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","8000","14000"," I've never seen such an exchange of ideas and people so angry about someone showing you the other side of a trade."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","14000","23000"," And not just saying a company that, let's just say, is supposed to make the world a better place, maybe a Tesla or security problems or COVID."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","23000","25000"," This is a failing mall-based retailer."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","25000","33000"," So the amount of people who are so passionate about putting GameStop higher, not based on any fundamentals, it just shows the natural state of the market right now."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","33000","37000"," Or Seth Klarman said today, a bunch of frogs in a pot of boiling water."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","37000","42000"," So let's just get right to the five reasons why we believe it's going back to $20."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","42000","48000"," Number one is the elephant in the room most obvious how people believe we are in the middle of a short squeeze."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","49000","53000"," Note that there was a very high short interest in the stock and there still is."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","53000","56000"," Your first question you have to ask yourself is why is there a high short interest?"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","56000","61000"," But moving beyond that, a stock of $40 right now has an open borrow on it."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","61000","63000"," You could borrow for a fairly decent rate."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","63000","69000"," There's plenty of options on the stock and it's no longer now we're looking at a trading phenomenon."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","69000","72000"," There's people just keeping it up by a lot of call volume."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","72000","75000"," There's no short squeeze that is happening as we speak."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","75000","79000"," Me personally who is short the stock, I have no problem selling the stock higher."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","79000","81000"," You're not going to change the story."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","81000","84000"," You're not going to change the underlying fundamentals of this company."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","84000","90000"," Therefore, as long as the borrows are available and insiders are still selling and the company needs money,"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","90000","93000"," you won't see a squeeze from here on in."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","93000","97000"," Number two, numbers don't lie."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","97000","99000"," People lie."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","99000","102000"," I know everyone on Twitter never has a losing trade."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","102000","104000"," Everyone on Reddit is a market genius."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","104000","106000"," I hear it all the time."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","106000","107000"," That's fine."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","107000","108000"," Those are people."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","108000","109000"," Let's look at the numbers."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","109000","111000"," Let's look at the numbers for GameStop."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","111000","117000"," Now understand as a short seller, I was the first short to actually come out and go long Tesla."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","117000","120000"," Once I saw the story changed, the numbers changed."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","120000","123000"," They were eating from the top and they were eating from the bottom."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","123000","126000"," And I identified the fact you can't be short this name."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","126000","129000"," And it's up I think 90% since then."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","129000","132000"," It's the opposite when it comes to GameStop."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","132000","136000"," NPD is the gold standard when it comes to gaming reports."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","136000","141000"," On January 14th, they put out their analysis of what December looked like in the video game season."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","141000","148000"," Hardware sales had their best month ever of 23% year over year because of the two cycles."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","148000","151000"," Over that time, GameStop was down 9%."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","151000","153000"," Now understand this is with physical locations."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","153000","157000"," Forget about all the future where they're going to lose to downloading and streaming."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","157000","161000"," Their physical locations were actually down during the best month."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","161000","165000"," They were losing to Amazon, Best Buy, Target and Walmart."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","165000","166000"," And the reason why?"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","166000","171000"," Because people are not going in to exchange their old discs anymore or old games for new games."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","171000","176000"," That model has become dead and antiquated and that was a cornerstone of GME."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","176000","182000"," So with those numbers that we saw come out of NPD, it shows that before they might even try to turn the company around,"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","182000","185000"," their current business is just drowning."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","185000","187000"," You cannot argue against that."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","187000","190000"," Number three, valuations matter."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","190000","192000"," This is not Tesla."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","192000","194000"," This is not a company that with a blue sky."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","194000","196000"," This is a retailer."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","196000","198000"," You look at valuations."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","198000","201000"," This is what no one's looking at on your Reddit forms."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","201000","205000"," So forget about the fact that analysts have a consensus $12 target on the stock."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","205000","207000"," Let's just go look at Hedge Eye."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","207000","208000"," And I like Hedge Eye."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","208000","210000"," I think they do great work with fans of it."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","210000","211000"," We use them."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","211000","212000"," We speak them."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","212000","213000"," They're smart guys."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","213000","215000"," They recommended GME when it was 14."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","215000","217000"," And if you bought it then, you would be making money."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","217000","226000"," At the time, if before GME reported their numbers, they were expecting 2021 EBITDA to be around 333 million."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","226000","228000"," Now the street is at 71 million."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","228000","231000"," And we think they're going to have negative EBITDA."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","231000","236000"," If they did 330 million, which seems like a completely off-beat number now,"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","236000","240000"," then they had the price target, Hedge Eye, at $26."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","240000","243000"," The model just does not work."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","243000","246000"," And when you want to talk about valuations, think about it this way."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","246000","248000"," This is a retailer."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","248000","250000"," Even if they fix it, they're still a retailer."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","250000","255000"," Training it 40 times next 12 months, EV to EBITDA."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","255000","256000"," 40."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","256000","257000"," Apple is 23."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","257000","259000"," Best Buy is 7."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","259000","261000"," Walmart is 13."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","261000","268000"," So if you like the company, the fact that GameStop has actually become an expensive stock is just beyond."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","269000","270000"," Number four."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","270000","274000"," Know who's on the other side of the trade."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","274000","276000"," I know who's long GameStop right now."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","276000","280000"," The people who are ordering pizzas to my house or signing me up for Tinder"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","280000","283000"," are doing all those cute things, trying to hack my Twitter account."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","283000","286000"," Now I know you've been going after a specific hedge fund."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","286000","287000"," No need to name."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","287000","288000"," That's been short GameStop."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","288000","290000"," People believe they're short."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","290000","295000"," This particular hedge fund happens to be one of the top consumer discretionary funds out there."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","295000","299000"," So you should actually listen and see who's short the name and why they're short the name."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","299000","302000"," As someone who does go short, I always look who owns it."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","302000","304000"," Ryan Cohen owns the stock at $9."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","304000","306000"," Very smart guy."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","306000","308000"," If Ryan sells it at $20, he doubled his money."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","308000","313000"," If Ryan sells it at $0, he still has more money than me and more money than you."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","313000","315000"," So where is the stock today?"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","315000","317000"," Who owns it and why people are short the stock?"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","317000","319000"," These are the names right now."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","319000","323000"," And last thing is the company can become your biggest enemy."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","323000","326000"," We're looking at a company with a billion dollars in debt."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","326000","331000"," If the stock was any higher, they should just sell stock right into you and raise money and pay off some debt."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","331000","335000"," More importantly, if they want to make an acquisition in the gaming space,"
"jyd7KFtx9ic","335000","338000"," acquisitions start in the billions in this place."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","338000","341000"," And they're going to have to sell a lot of stock to do that."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","341000","346000"," Me personally, I think you could have a pickup."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","346000","350000"," This is either going to be JC Penny that brightens in when Bill Ackman brought in Ron Johnson."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","350000","354000"," People got excited he was going to turn it, but you just can't change a bad retailer."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","354000","358000"," Or it could be blockbuster video that never adapted the technology."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","358000","362000"," You know, I look at Ryan Cohen's letter, which is well written two months ago, two games.management."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","362000","366000"," How they completely dropped the ball with what they were doing."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","366000","369000"," It's the same management right now."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","369000","373000"," The stock was $20 before we saw any holiday data."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","373000","376000"," There's no reason it doesn't go right back to $20."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","376000","378000"," There's nothing in place there."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","378000","384000"," You can get mad, you can hack my account, you can go to Twitter, you can sign on, you can call me every name."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","384000","391000"," If you want to save the company, take your energy, go out there and actually buy something from GameStop."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","391000","393000"," Because that's the only thing that saves this."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","393000","398000"," Other than that, the more you buy, I'm sure there will be supply on the other side."
"jyd7KFtx9ic","398000","401000"," Cautious investing to everyone."
