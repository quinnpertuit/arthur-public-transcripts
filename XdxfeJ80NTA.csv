"3257810","3262090"," And pricing or let's say if you're an employee right. "
"3263490","3267050"," There's some expectation of what you'd make for money."
"3268130","3270750"," That stayed pretty consistent."

"3286630","3291130"," The cost of living we're talking about things like would be an example like."
"3296160","3301860"," Minimum wage let's say it was $10 an hour it was like 10 bucks an hour for like 20 30"
"3301860","3302600"," years right. "
"3303600","3304760"," And then we're talking about."
"3309280","3311460"," No risk to that."
"3312320","3314300"," No risk to that. "
"3316620","3320380"," To that any change of change to that right so."

"3326580","3327240"," Third quarter earnings. "
"3328300","3332560"," Over the decades right you have a stability in wage."
"3334360","3337980"," Generally rough rough stability in wages."
"3338780","3342560"," Now the cost of living there has not been that stability. "
"3344020","3350560"," Now but it hasn't been wild either so let's say you bought hamburger meat and it was 99 cents"
"3350560","3357220"," a pound."
"3357220","3361460"," Over the decades wages never followed."
"3362660","3363200"," Right. "
"3365520","3370280"," And say it's some wage stability and we know that the facts are that."
"3370960","3372540"," Past 20 30 years."
"3373480","3377640"," The quality of life has gone down cost of living has gone up. "
"3378280","3381060"," Slowly over time though not huge but slowly."
"3381500","3385460"," Matter of fact you might know when you were young your parents might say oh we're going to wait"
"3385460","3386880"," until hamburger goes on."
"3387520","3391480"," And then we'll buy it when it's $2.99 or two bucks or whatever it is right. "

"3449200","3451100"," Right so so anyways. "
"3452540","3456760"," There's a lot of there's like wage stability and there was cost of living."
"3458060","3461040"," Creep but still stability over decades right."
"3462360","3468600"," And then COVID happened and things got wild right now if I'm a producer. "
"3469600","3473760"," Of hamburger or eggs we can use eggs hamburger doesn't matter."
"3474820","3477920"," Right as a matter of fact this is very true."
"3477920","3484200"," My family has a large ranch in Montana and there are times when it's good to raise cattle. "
"3484200","3489200"," There's other times when it's better to raise llama for their coats right."
"3489980","3492640"," Sometimes better to raise wheat or great."
"3492840","3499620"," All kind depending on what the what products out there that you can maximize your profit is what"
"3499620","3501680"," they will raise or grow. "
"3502980","3503620"," Now."
"3506920","3511120"," COVID happens and you see what happens out there right."
"3511120","3514740"," Well anyways you're a producer if I have if I sell you beef right. "
"3515160","3521580"," I already know that let's I'm so let's say manufacturing I'm part of the manufacturing in the"
"3521580","3524300"," retail process of selling ground beef okay."
"3524780","3526760"," It's a very simplified thing here ground beef."
"3527600","3528800"," I know that. "
"3529740","3535080"," Only every 20 30 years can I raise my prices permanently."
"3536080","3538820"," So let's say I have my price of beef is one dollar."
"3539920","3541340"," Right one dollar. "
"3542060","3545960"," I know that for the next decade I just raised my prices to one dollar."
"3546240","3552800"," I know I'm going to plan for not being able to raise permanently price of ground beef for likely 10"
"3552800","3555700"," to 30 years maybe 10 to 20 10 to 30."
"3556740","3562560"," Now from time to time those prices can fluctuate that that ground beef might go to a dollar fifty"
"3562560","3564260"," first six months or three months. "
"3564260","3569920"," Might go to two bucks for a quick spike and then back down to a dollar right you can remember"
"3569920","3574580"," being a kid and you your parents likely say oh that's on sale."
"3575180","3576920"," So I'm going to go buy it right."
"3577780","3584180"," You probably heard your parents say have you noticed that ground beef has not come down from a"
"3584180","3587720"," dollar fifty now now it's a dollar fifty but five years have passed right. "
"3587720","3596600"," So slow increase in the cost of ground beef but no major shock permanent changes and this is built"
"3596600","3599040"," into the production of these goods."
"3600460","3607100"," These producers know that they can't permanently raise prices they can't go from a dollar to five"
"3607100","3610560"," in five years and hold it there permanently."
"3611420","3618200"," Now in COVID that all changed some of it was for good reason and some of it was not and"
"3618200","3624620"," some of it was because producers understood that they can only have so many opportunities to"
"3624620","3627940"," permanently raise the prices of goods and services. "
"3628760","3634600"," Okay so an easy way to see this is in McDonald's hamburgers."
"3635520","3643560"," If you look back in history they've only gone up in price permanently and most recently if you go"
"3643560","3648780"," to eat fast food what do you get and how much do you pay for what you get."
"3648780","3651600"," Right it is you don't get much do you. "
"3651860","3656260"," Like matter of fact your services and some of that have gone down you've seen dining rooms close"
"3656260","3663820"," you've seen automation you've seen less workers right you've seen lesser quality and you've seen"
"3663820","3667520"," shrinkage right you've seen shrinkage and all kinds of stuff right."
"3668020","3672280"," You're not seeing the exact same thing that you used to see matter of fact you see some of these"
"3672280","3676640"," some of these fast food joints are saying no more."
"3677340","3680260"," As many sodas as you want you get one soda that's it. "
"3680420","3681640"," Oh and your dining room is closed."
"3681740","3688800"," Oh and our hours are no longer 24 and no you can't have breakfast 24 hours a day right."
"3690020","3699100"," So you're seeing this major shift this is an opportunity for producers to to raise their prices"
"3699100","3699780"," permanently. "
"3700620","3707900"," This is one of those moments you're young you may not understand this or have experience with this"
"3707900","3715180"," in the next 20 30 years you'll remember these moments and say hey I've been I've seen this happen."
"3715860","3722160"," 20 30 years ago during covid and it's happening once again right and you'll have this experience"
"3722160","3727660"," that you're going through right now with producers of goods and services."
"3727660","3735480"," So we were discussing yesterday but we got in with this conversation is evolved into this point"
"3735480","3740960"," where we were discussing wage spiral and wage growth. "
"3742260","3749540"," And how you could look over the years and not see it too glaring like you'd see the slow March"
"3749540","3754870"," in progress up but not wages catching up in any meaningful way."
"3755930","3762890"," Slow pace but not anything meaningful and so Joe made some great posts that if you look at the 20"
"3762890","3767290"," 23 numbers everything looks great out there if you look at the fed numbers."
"3768670","3773690"," It like the numbers they're not fudged but they're kind of fudged. "
"3774850","3781850"," Right and if you look back 20 30 years there was no cause for concern or alarm."
"3782810","3791290"," Now this past year even though the numbers are still on the surface on the surface there they look"
"3791290","3793530"," still kind of okay are in line."
"3794650","3801990"," There's an underbelly of wage spiral growth that actually is going on and another fascinating part"
"3801990","3808910"," of this is who makes those changes who impacts wage spiral growth. "
"3808910","3813890"," And we were just I was what we were talking yesterday in my discussion with Joe centered upon."
"3814610","3821630"," You know it does like an office worker that like a low level office worker let's say right now they"
"3821630","3827810"," make $15 an hour or between 15 and 20 let's say you work in."
"3828450","3834230"," Give me a US corporation like a large corporate office environment like how about a."
"3835110","3840930"," Health care company like that now right so they got office workers all over the United States"
"3840930","3841230"," right. "
"3842090","3847830"," If you're a low level office worker for adding a you probably make what 15 bucks an hour 20 bucks"
"3847830","3848210"," an hour."
"3849290","3854350"," You're probably not going to your job is likely not going to."
"3856210","3858790"," Impact wage spiral growth okay. "
"3859730","3866570"," You're not going to be a motivator or a driver of wages going up but there are some professions out"
"3866570","3874650"," there that are leading indicators or leading hey you might see a sea change in in wages going up."
"3875150","3883130"," One of those one of those places is a lower paid employee someone that makes minimum wage 10 bucks"
"3883130","3883790"," an hour."
"3883790","3893670"," I posted yesterday 23 states have passed or or excuse me has passed a higher minimum"
"3893670","3895090"," wage standards right. "
"3895890","3904530"," I employ laborers I could get away with paying a labor like a bottom wrong labor somewhere between"
"3904530","3910670"," 10 and $20 today for the cost of living for a labor I can't get away with paying them anything"
"3910670","3913370"," less than $30 an hour."
"3913790","3922790"," I see signs for pavers and stuff like that for rinky dink companies paying their laborers $30 an"
"3922790","3923070"," hour."
"3924740","3934390"," You see unions across the nation signing new agreements but the UAW is like one of the last unions"
"3934390","3941970"," to be reset renegotiating their contracts UPS FedEx railroad workers Hollywood. "
"3941970","3949850"," You name it everyone's renegotiating right now that is unusual that is unusual."
"3951170","3959150"," The raising of minimum wage is unusual now that's not impacting in my take is that that's not"
"3959150","3965450"," impacting wage spiral growth in these metrics that are put out by the fed."
"3966150","3974250"," Okay because of that office worker working across America this this large group of the bureaucracy"
"3974250","3983650"," of corporate business they're not impacted yet right so that person might only be making $15 an"
"3983650","3986330"," hour $20 an hour right. "
"3986330","3995130"," But there are other parts of our workforce that are getting higher wages so it creates this"
"3995130","4002370"," disparity where you might have had a McDonald's worker making 10 an hour and then you have the one"
"4002370","4007150"," step up of an office worker making 15 maybe 20."
"4007150","4012290"," It's not a livable wage but it's higher than that worker right there's some structure."
"4012690","4018270"," Now if you start to make the McDonald's work you say the McDonald's worker hey you're now making 15"
"4018270","4025750"," and hey look Mr labor out there Mrs labor out there shoveling dirt off the side of the road you're"
"4025750","4034150"," now making 15 right or 20 or 30 that office worker might not be the driver of higher wages. "
"4034150","4040610"," And they are probably the fault that's probably already know that they're the bulk of our workforce"
"4040610","4047170"," but they're not going to want to make less than what this these these bottom wrong workers are"
"4047170","4047890"," making right."
"4048860","4055430"," So there will be like a drag along for these for the rest of this workforce you get what I'm"
"4055430","4055790"," saying."
"4055790","4061770"," So if this office worker was made is now making less than someone flipping hamburger patties"
"4061770","4065330"," eventually these corporations will have to pay it. "
"4065650","4072250"," You can see this right now in this tug of war amongst the big talking heads and the corporations"
"4072250","4077090"," and the companies out there in the United States where they don't want to pay these office workers."
"4077090","4081850"," They don't want to get someone from a net net net net making 15 to 20 and have to start"
"4081850","4084310"," paying them 20 to 30 an hour."
"4085070","4088030"," And that's a large part of our workforce right. "
"4088610","4095689"," But there there was those those those mass aerations are there though unlike any time in the past"
"4095689","4097490"," 20 or 30 years."
"4097510","4101569"," So although our which we're saying we don't have wage price spiral."
"4101569","4109330"," There are the mechanics of it happening in the background and those impacts should be felt over the"
"4109330","4111330"," next two to four years. "
"4112109","4121890"," As a matter of fact that UPS contract and a bunch of other unions and other workforce out there as"
"4121890","4124010"," they begin to institute these higher wages."
"4124010","4130729"," You should see a kind of a drag or come along and drag along of the rest of the United"
"4130729","4139069"," States workforce to higher wages that should still show itself in the coming two or three four"
"4139069","4139550"," years."
"4139550","4145210"," There's a lot of impact from that in our system in our society right. "
"4145670","4153050"," If you're making more money as a UPS driver and you rent a house for me and I know in"
"4153050","4155490"," three four years you're making some pretty good money right."
"4156090","4158109"," I'm going to ask you to pay me more rent."
"4158770","4164790"," If I sell you hamburger I'm going to ask you to pay more for your hamburger or your or your"
"4164790","4166109"," burgers from McDonald's. "
"4166109","4171130"," And if there's a window as a corporation from a corporation I can do two things."
"4171890","4178970"," I can for as long as possible try to crush wages and implement a higher price structure."
"4179229","4185270"," I get to capture a ton of profit even if that window is only four or five ten years something"
"4185270","4186950"," like that does that make sense to you out there. "
"4186950","4193450"," Hopefully it does right at me as a corporation I already know I've already got smart people telling"
"4193450","4200870"," me that wages are going to spiral unusually spiral to the upside."
"4201070","4205710"," So I'm going to try to crush those wages as much as I possibly can and for the people that"
"4205710","4208130"," are making that money are expected to make that money."
"4208130","4214970"," I'm also going to slam in higher prices for goods and services right maximize my profit on that"
"4214970","4220850"," bell curve for the next ten or twenty or thirty years that I can hold those prices higher. "
"4222770","4229010"," So our discussion yesterday we had a phone yesterday talking about this and the question became is"
"4229010","4237020"," is everything normal or is it really not now that led into a post that I made on Twitter yesterday."
"4237880","4243480"," That whole coming in here to test that testing that right now see if this holds or not I'm trying"
"4243480","4248020"," to watch this see if it holds or not or if it rejects and we start sending it to the"
"4248020","4248620"," downside."
"4250580","4252960"," Keep a real close eye on this down here. "
"4253700","4260640"," So if you're looking so so this post that I made yesterday how to do with young people people under"
"4260640","4262260"," the age of thirty five."
"4262260","4269820"," And when I said what I posted yesterday I'm going to post it said median net worth of people under"
"4269820","4270900"," thirty five years old."
"4271980","4280260"," The category with the lowest net worth was thirty nine thousand dollars in twenty twenty two. "
"4280940","4289080"," A giant increase since two thousand nineteen when it was sixteen thousand dollars."
"4289080","4294680"," And I wrote a visa here they come now that was just a quip right but inside of that post"
"4294680","4300700"," someone asked me a question they said are they a statement they said I think those numbers are"
"4300700","4301020"," wrong."
"4301620","4304060"," And I wrote the Fed does like to fudge. "
"4304640","4312760"," And then I continued on with more statements where I said also there are also a lot of dynamics at"
"4312760","4315800"," play here a lot of young people cannot afford life."
"4316440","4320420"," So there is a significant portion of them still living at their parents own."
"4320880","4327400"," We have one of the largest or increases in kids today not leaving home. "
"4328360","4336280"," More so than the past since since nineteen fifties since World War II people came back from World"
"4336280","4340480"," War II and started to make suburbia started to get mortgages for houses and all that kind of stuff."
"4340480","4348620"," And so right now we have a massive increase in young people not having the ability to leave home."
"4349620","4355160"," They also have to take on more roommates than ever before and a lot of them are actually homeless"
"4355160","4359840"," living out of their cars believe it or not strikes Israeli posts with guided missiles. "
"4359840","4365200"," So just to repeat that there has been a saying they've struck Israeli posts with guided missiles."
"4366980","4367900"," Guided missiles."
"4373640","4376380"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright. "

"4382660","4384460"," trial at Ticksright.com."
"4385240","4388960"," So on the surface of this it looks like kids say are better off."
"4389480","4393800"," Now let's say I'm a young person today I'm eighteen twenty years old I got a college I get out"
"4393800","4395280"," of that huge college debt."
"4396180","4403760"," I can't afford the cost to get this R1 or this S1 for you here. "
"4404980","4414970"," Remember that downside S1 is at four seventeen thirty five way way down"
"4414970","4415210"," there."
"4418280","4428060"," So if you're looking so on the surface you think"
"4428060","4432780"," you'd say to yourself hey everything looks great for a young person out there everything should be"
"4432780","4433200"," fine."
"4433200","4437060"," Oh there I already put it in there it's already in there it's right here. "
"4437740","4444160"," I think that one second here"
"4445790","4450510"," S1."
"4473720","4475480"," There's a S1 down there."
"4475960","4480480"," So the idea on the surface is hey kids are better off than they've ever been but that's because"
"4480480","4484500"," they're either living at home able to save their money. "
"4484500","4485200"," Right."
"4486500","4491820"," You can push that up for you right there."
"4501940","4508980"," So they're able to stay at home and save their money so they have more money on their person"
"4508980","4516060"," because of the high number of kids that are now staying at home unlike before but there's an even"
"4516060","4517800"," scarier prospect here. "
"4517800","4522660"," That the class of young people that are not living at home not homeless."
"4524420","4529460"," Not having a roommate situation that are actually out there having their apartments or first time"
"4529460","4530260"," houses or whatever."
"4530920","4537340"," Their cost of living is through the roof with those high savings for the kids that are staying home"
"4537340","4544960"," that almost doubling of savings is the impact of the of the inflationary and cost of living"
"4544960","4546540"," increases that are. "
"4546540","4552480"," That young people are encountering which is wild right now absolutely wild and you look at those"
"4552480","4553080"," numbers here."
"4553280","4557280"," So I said on the surface it looks great but it is more a function of being able to save"
"4557280","4562280"," to save in less than ideal circumstances from the point of view of young people."
"4562280","4567920"," Remember if you don't have those savings it is likely because all of your money that you are making"
"4567920","4573780"," is to pay for the things that the people mentioned above do not have to pay for the increase is"
"4573780","4576360"," likely tied to their inability to make it on. "
"4577360","4586320"," So that increase in savings though might look like a boon to the younger generation it is actually"
"4586320","4586780"," not."
"4587140","4592320"," It's actually showing the amount of money that a young person needs to make."
"4592960","4596900"," Now this is seen by companies and corporations out there. "
"4597180","4598300"," This is seen by unions."
"4598680","4601040"," This is seen by construction workers."
"4601040","4604640"," They got a laborer that that's just a laborer out there. "
"4605000","4609340"," You have a laborer that goes out there works all day long right when he gets done or she gets"
"4609340","4612220"," done and she can't afford McDonald's."
"4612340","4617720"," She can't afford clothes that don't fall apart because it's throw away fashion."
"4617720","4624200"," She can't afford the child care that a kid has to go through the insurance the medical insurance"
"4624200","4628320"," the licenses and registrations the rent. "
"4629560","4631300"," I was looking at an article yesterday."
"4631560","4635460"," There was somebody charging somebody charging to change breaks on a vehicle."
"4636080","4642820"," Eight hundred fucking dollars to change breaks at at a at a repair shop. "
"4643080","4643520"," Unreal."
"4644220","4650080"," Eight hundred dollars to pay to have someone have their breaks paid or breaks changed."
"4650840","4654380"," So the cost of living for these young people is out of control. "
"4654380","4661240"," Absolutely out of control and it's reflected in the savings of the kids that are staying staying"
"4661240","4662800"," back to live with their parents."
"4663460","4667660"," Shockingly enough right where you think kids are doing better."
"4667860","4673280"," The ones that are actually paying right now out on their own are they're getting demolished out"
"4673280","4675460"," there and you have the rise of. "
"4676080","4679120"," Kids having side what do they call side hustles."
"4679360","4685660"," You got kids having second third jobs trying to try to make it out there without parents to take"
"4685660","4688400"," care of them or friends to share costs with."
"4688880","4695360"," So it's just kind of wild and eye opening and so we're discussing this yesterday. "
"4695740","4702140"," I made some of these posts yesterday and the real question becomes the cheapness of money and the"
"4702140","4704040"," expectation of cheapness of money."
"4704040","4709720"," Now even though a corporation may not want to pay the office worker right now there's likely smart"
"4709720","4716540"," people out there that there's likely smarter people out there that say well we can we can well we"
"4716540","4718620"," know we have to pay these office workers one day."
"4718620","4724760"," We'll give them wage stagnation make them work a second third job or a side also and squeeze them"
"4724760","4731640"," as long as possible and we'll raise our prices and maximize our profits until we have to give in. "
"4731640","4736000"," And you're seeing some some weakness in that in our workforce."
"4736280","4739820"," You're seeing it in the union new union contracts being renegotiated."
"4740600","4742100"," You saw it with the airline pilots. "
"4742100","4743200"," You're seeing it with Hollywood."
"4743400","4749000"," You're seeing it with make no mistake auto workers all kinds of other unions."
"4749200","4751960"," You're seeing it with UPS drivers you name it. "
"4752040","4752540"," You're seeing it."
"4752540","4758480"," You're seeing it with with minimum wage reform across the country happening."
"4758480","4763800"," So will it what is what does that paint a picture for for the future. "
"4764340","4770540"," And one of the one of the one of the cards or one of the tells right the tells like"
"4770540","4777980"," playing a poker game that everyone knows it's going to happen is watching like UPS saying hey"
"4777980","4779960"," you'll make a hundred twenty hundred forty thousand dollars."
"4780180","4781020"," It'll take four years."
"4781300","4784360"," We're going to pay that over scaled over the next four years. "
"4784360","4786060"," But we already know it's coming."
"4786320","4792200"," So there's like a tipping of the hand even though the Fed is telling you no no no no no"
"4792200","4793160"," no this isn't happening."
"4793740","4794860"," No no no no. "
"4795040","4798500"," Cobra America is already telling that it is going to happen."
"4798500","4799980"," They've raised their prices."
"4800280","4801720"," They're not bringing them back down. "
"4802560","4810080"," And they're giving some some concession that yeah eventually will pay you that money that you need"
"4810080","4813380"," to to deal with our higher prices."
"4813380","4821680"," So the question becomes in the next four five years is money going to be cheaper and you might say"
"4821680","4822420"," well cap."
"4823040","4827720"," You know the dollar store at the dollar or five or dollar or it's not going to go negative cap. "
"4827920","4829860"," It doesn't have to go negative."
"4830520","4834620"," It can just be worth less right you're paying more."
"4835300","4840360"," And you're going to get paid more for goods and services you're going to get paid more at your job"
"4840360","4841820"," and you're going to pay more. "
"4841820","4845300"," For those things that you want to have in life."
"4846220","4851960"," So that is the conundrum right if that happens someone yesterday mentioned to me."
"4852280","4857620"," Well that's bad for the stock market and I said no it's not you're proving my point. "
"4858580","4865020"," If you're going to have cheapness and money if there are if there are everyone out there knows that"
"4865020","4868060"," your hamburger is going to go up and permanently it's going to go up."
"4868060","4875660"," If eventually wages are going to catch up to that right then that would make the stock market cheap"
"4875660","4880940"," and undervalued not now but in the next five years."
"4881640","4886840"," So it doesn't mean that it's worth more it doesn't we're not talking about like this apple worth"
"4886840","4888260"," more than five years or not. "
"4888620","4893300"," It's that money is cheaper in five years four years."
"4893300","4902200"," So that in its in and of itself makes these makes these stocks cheaper not as valuable does that"
"4902200","4902960"," make sense to you."
"4903200","4910880"," So apple today let's say it's fair value just pretend it's fair value was one hundred dollars in"
"4910880","4912180"," the next five years. "
"4912520","4918580"," It's not going to be if the value was a hundred dollars and five year money from now."
"4919400","4928100"," Is not going to be the same and crazily even more crazily because of this ramp in the cost of"
"4928100","4934100"," cost of goods and this ramp in the wages that are being put out there unlike any other time in"
"4934100","4935320"," the last 20 or 30 years."
"4936260","4941860"," Companies like apple their fair value if it was a hundred bucks is way lower than it should be. "
"4941860","4951740"," So that that argues that the stock market is going to become way undervalued the next four years"
"4951740","4954140"," not overvalued but undervalued."
"4954280","4958760"," Now some of you out there are saying well the Fed is going to put a stop to that but"
"4958760","4962200"," we're not seeing it historically we have not seen it."
"4962200","4969900"," We have not seen hamburgers go back to 29 cents on Tuesdays 39 cents on Wed on Wednesdays. "
"4970120","4972840"," We don't see gas at 20 cents a fucking gallon."
"4973280","4982620"," We see wages booming right now in the early phases of it we see the late phases and the holding"
"4982620","4985820"," of the cost of goods and services staying high."
"4985820","4988060"," Have you asked me ask you a question. "
"4988480","4990780"," Have you seen less service when you go out to eat."
"4991100","4993780"," Have you seen prices significantly come down."
"4994040","4997580"," I haven't my cost the cost of me and living my taxes. "
"4998260","5004840"," Everything that I pay my taxes my my services my health care you name it everywhere I go everything"
"5004840","5011520"," that I do is cost a ton of money tons of money and I haven't seen any of that come"
"5011520","5011840"," down."
"5011840","5016400"," Even though they're fudging numbers it you know what it more is it's like it's like a tablespoon"
"5016400","5020820"," feeding you you're going to accept this and you're going to like it does that make sense."
"5025900","5031400"," Yeah $800 break change $800 break change that was on Reddit yesterday matter of fact it was that"
"5031400","5034280"," one of the top posts on just rolled into the shop. "
"5034280","5041860"," A mechanic said hey it was funny too because the mechanic thought he was in the right he said this"
"5041860","5048980"," person came in to change his breaks and they walked away and said fuck you I'm not paying 800"
"5048980","5049280"," bucks."
"5050200","5054640"," And the guy was like can you believe that guy and the whole comment section was yeah you know what"
"5054640","5058260"," fuck you mechanic $800 is out of fucking control."
"5058260","5066620"," And you're I'm seeing I see it everywhere any any and everything that I do is more expensive or"
"5066620","5070560"," lesser quality or less services. "
"5070920","5077340"," Like it's not what it was right I'm not getting dude Amazon Amazon are they charging for returns"
"5077340","5080720"," now they're charging more for their Amazon prime."
"5080720","5086240"," Do you get the same movies and TV shows that you once did you still get the free shipping that's"
"5086240","5087000"," overnight anymore."

"5101200","5104580"," Are you getting a tons of new movies on Netflix anymore."
"5105260","5108020"," No no no you're not getting any of that stuff right. "

"5113800","5116080"," movies and TV shows in these other countries right."
"5116080","5120620"," Nothing there any good just that you can see it's just a cheaper product right."
"5127800","5129480"," That's what I said that's what I said. "

"5387520","5389440"," We're already down there as I'll change out the rotors."
"5389860","5391160"," I didn't change."
"5391960","5396920"," Yeah, I think I changed the calipers to all the way around the parts were expensive. "
"5397760","5401060"," It was a Cadillac escalated change all of them on the on the escalator."
"5401060","5407560"," I think it might have cost me three or 400 but even if you were at 150 bucks an hour."

"5409140","5410760"," Two hours of labor. "
"5411180","5412500"," That's what is that 600?"
"5413740","5417640"," It's maybe six six twenty five six fifty on the high end."

"5437000","5437540"," that stuff."
"5438180","5438540"," Right?"
"5438700","5440120"," Let's say I'm working a job. "
"5440280","5444360"," How many of you out there working a job and could take a hit like that?"
"5446240","5447660"," 800 bucks just off the cuff."
"5447880","5450580"," Hey, you need to you need to cover 800 bucks cash this week."
"5451640","5453400"," And it's not going to hurt you. "
"5454780","5456500"," I don't know if you can or can't do that."
"5456580","5462160"," How many of you how many of you out there have how many of you out there under 35 years"
"5462160","5462480"," old."
"5463040","5467400"," And your net worth is 30, 40,000 dollars. "
"5467560","5471140"," Like even if you're married, your husband, your wife, whatever that is."
"5471900","5476460"," Do you guys each have 20,000 extra in cash lying around?"

"5479180","5482000"," If you're if you're not living or you should have it. "
"5482000","5484240"," But if you don't, let me know."
"5484400","5486520"," Or maybe or maybe you're living at home and you have it."
"5486860","5487120"," What are you?"
"5487260","5488740"," What's your situation assigned with that?"
"5496780","5500160"," Israel says we have targets on three cells on the border with Lebanon. "
"5504600","5508740"," Yeah, you can resurface your own your own your own your own rotors."
"5509320","5510700"," You can actually do it yourself."
"5511760","5513040"," You can still do it. "
"5513140","5517960"," You can actually you can actually sand down your rotors if if you so dare."
"5518680","5521460"," With the flat grinder, but not everybody knows that."
"5521500","5522600"," I don't think everybody knows that. "
"5523140","5525440"," People in doing that forever and ever and ever."
"5525720","5527720"," You probably shouldn't be, but you can."
"5528380","5531160"," You can resurface your own rotors if you'd like to. "
"5531260","5532140"," Let's see this over here."
"5532760","5534980"," We've got that big old band down here, right?"
"5535180","5536080"," The supply down here."
"5536340","5537420"," This dream is sponsored. "
"5538180","5540700"," You got that giant supply up in here, right?"
"5541260","5542280"," And market profile levels."
"5542280","5546360"," I'm going to go up there and take out all those take out on supply to the upside up here."
"5549840","5555180"," So this leads me back to this whole entire thing, which is there's a thesis out there. "
"5555640","5558420"," So this whole conversation goes back to a thesis."
"5559500","5563760"," And this thesis is where everyone's pushing their heels in."
"5563760","5570940"," And this fear that's out there that's saying it's like dual fear and it's also. "
"5572520","5575500"," It's also a reality check."
"5575860","5578340"," So it begs the question to you."
"5579620","5581640"," It begs the question to you. "
"5581920","5583520"," Do you actually believe?"
"5584580","5590680"," Do you believe that the fed will fight that inflation, the real inflation?"
"5590680","5596960"," This, this, this like coming through sense of the cheapness of money in the next four to five"
"5596960","5597300"," years."
"5598200","5602620"," And historically, they haven't thought it historically."
"5603820","5608600"," We move forward and goods and services costs more and we had a spike in it. "
"5609020","5613940"," That just took that is taking place right now with wage spiral and inflation."
"5614640","5616820"," Now inflation year every year is coming down."
"5616820","5620060"," Now let's say they, let's say they pull this out of their ass. "
"5620540","5622320"," Think about this, think about this closely."
"5623280","5628100"," At some point you're going to have Jerome Powell come out there and he's going to have a choice."
"5629180","5630580"," He listened closely to this. "
"5631440","5635260"," He's going to say, Hey, look, we beat inflation."
"5636280","5639740"," We got down to our target of two percent year over year."
"5640360","5645200"," Meanwhile, you're going to be looking and saying, well, wait a minute, wages have come up and I'm"
"5645200","5648140"," still paying extremely more than I ever was. "
"5648980","5649300"," Right."
"5649520","5650760"," Why is he saying this?"
"5651860","5657020"," When in fact, right, once they hit that two percent target, guess what's going to happen?"
"5657560","5661280"," Inflation numbers will bounce and start to go higher again."
"5662060","5662360"," Right. "
"5662560","5663740"," They'll still actually go up."
"5664320","5664580"," Right."
"5664660","5665620"," So they'll declare victory. "
"5666920","5667000"," Right."
"5667220","5668040"," We did it."
"5668500","5670260"," Inflation will start rising again. "
"5670640","5671780"," The numbers will begin to rise."
"5671780","5673760"," Nothing has changed though."
"5674160","5675700"," Your beef is still higher. "
"5675940","5677480"," Your wages are still higher."
"5678080","5678500"," Right."
"5679340","5681640"," And then it comes back to the stock market. "
"5682100","5688180"," Stock market because of the cheapness of money and because of the higher wages and the higher costs"
"5688180","5692820"," will need to be reprised to the upside, not the downside."
"5693540","5699540"," Or you're on the other side of that fence and you think to yourself, that's not going to happen"
"5699540","5699800"," cap."
"5699800","5701600"," We're going to get prices down. "
"5701800","5704000"," We're going to get hamburgers at 39 cents."
"5704360","5706320"," And we're going to get wages back down again."
"5706540","5708620"," We're going to take these wages away from these people. "
"5708800","5711120"," We're going to tell that UPS work on the next contract."
"5711500","5712080"," Fuck you."
"5712220","5713520"," You ain't making 120 grand. "
"5713820","5716400"," You're going back to making 90 or 70 a year."
"5718160","5719500"," Do you believe that?"
"5720180","5723000"," Because I'll tell you historically that is not what has happened."
"5723440","5726640"," We've actually gone up and up and up and up. "
"5728680","5735620"," If that is the case, then that means that our stock market is going to get reprised higher."
"5735980","5743320"," So when you see people out there saying, hey, expect 5000, expect 6000, they mean it."
"5743860","5746300"," When you hear people like, who's my guy back here?"
"5746400","5747380"," Let me go back here and look at this. "
"5747880","5749160"," Who's my guy back here?"
"5750000","5756000"," When you see that guy, you see that guy over there telling you that we're going to 6000."
"5756980","5762800"," The reason he's telling you that is not because he's necessarily really bullish."
"5763500","5764400"," He's not bullish. "
"5765060","5769100"," He's just saying, hey, your money is going to be worthless."
"5770240","5777400"," And so the stock market will demand to go higher to meet that worthlessness of money, the cheapness"
"5777400","5777940"," of money."
"5779720","5781380"," Does that make sense to you?"
"5781480","5784680"," So if you see people out there saying, hey, we should go to 5000. "
"5784960","5785880"," We should go to 6000."
"5786540","5788300"," It's not because they're bulls."
"5788980","5795660"," It's because they realize and know that historically, your money is going to be worth less and less"
"5795660","5796840"," and less over time. "
"5797040","5800780"," And we just encountered a major ramp in both of those things."
"5801120","5805100"," We're not in the middle of a 20 or 30 year cycle of producer pricing."
"5806240","5806740"," Does that make sense?"
"5806740","5814900"," So if I'm making hamburgers and I only have an opportunity every 20 or 30 years to increase prices"
"5814900","5818620"," permanently with a major move higher, right?"
"5819200","5826460"," That would also say to you that you should expect a major run in the stock market in the coming"
"5826460","5831180"," two, three, four, five years, maybe even a run for the next 10 years. "
"5831180","5840860"," Because to catch up to this now new raising of prices across the board and payments across the"
"5840860","5842340"," board and wages and the form of wages."
"5848380","5852140"," Also, bear town sheriff saying he has redone his his rotors himself."
"5852500","5853780"," Yeah, you can definitely do those yourself. "
"5854880","5859880"," I was I was too like, I thought to myself, I should resurface my rotors and I'm like, I'm too"
"5859880","5860300"," old for that."
"5860340","5861680"," Now I make too much money."
"5862100","5864240"," I'm like too cheap to pay for it to be done in a shop. "
"5864980","5867720"," And but at the same time, I was like, fuck, I'll just buy the rotors."
"5867840","5869080"," So it's like a happy medium for myself."
"5892320","5895020"," Let's see what you guys let me read for so many guys are saying here hold on here. "
"5902540","5907780"," Read reading YouTube comments right now."

"5921460","5922240"," pay 800 bucks."
"5922800","5929940"," And the comment section of that post revolted and said, how about fuck you for charging 800 bucks?"
"5930180","5930660"," That's outrageous."
"5932140","5938540"," And the further commenting in that post was, you know what, I can't afford that as a worker. "
"5938780","5939720"," I can't afford $800."
"5940340","5942060"," That is why I'm outraged right now."
"5942400","5947740"," I'm already got a job and a side hustle and a side side hustle and a side side side side"
"5947740","5948720"," hustle of some kind. "
"5949840","5952780"," And so the guy, the guy, the person, I don't know if it's a guy or whatever said, I'm going"
"5952780","5953440"," to go do it myself."
"5954700","5957680"," And they end up taking the vehicle to leave and do their own breaks."

"7868130","7869270"," I'm looking for a bounce here. "
"7870370","7874550"," I've got no more put, so I'm looking to buy this bounce if I can catch this right down here."
"7874970","7882290"," I don't like this last little gap bill because if they leave it behind and just start heading"
"7882290","7882590"," higher."
"7883350","7884650"," There's a gap right here too. "
"7887550","7889790"," There's now a gap created right here."

"7964230","7965990"," This is the bounce squeeze higher."
"7967610","7972450"," Now I'm thinking about buying calls here, but those sometimes they'll leave this stuff behind, but"
"7972450","7979450"," I'm really looking for just to retest that one minute and then the quick closure and then we're out"
"7979450","7979710"," of here. "

"8099410","8101390"," My view, it's not quite time to buy calls. "
"8101690","8103770"," 7187 gaps still left unfilled."
"8105210","8106870"," NDX has a gap that needs filled."

"8445920","8447500"," His dad's divorce."
"8449580","8450940"," He's an only son."
"8450940","8453780"," And I think he's an only son. "
"8454580","8455280"," I don't know."
"8455380","8456260"," Yeah, he's an only son."
"8456840","8461500"," But his dad, his dad, mom or divorce, right?"
"8461620","8466280"," His dad's getting much older and his dad always spent time with him. "
"8466380","8468900"," Seeing that gap get closed right now on SPX."
"8469960","8479880"," But his dad always stayed relevant to his"
"8479880","8480680"," son's life."
"8483520","8485560"," And, you know, this is kind of a cool thing. "
"8485800","8492920"," So his dad came over last night to watch a game with his son."
"8493680","8499520"," Now, a son is a professional, has his own life, right?"
"8499640","8500640"," His own things that he does."
"8500960","8506380"," But the dad had spent all these years watching sports with his kid with his son, right?"
"8507020","8510140"," So they had something to share when he was younger. "
"8510860","8512660"," The son picked up watching sports."
"8514640","8520800"," And he was watching this game with his son last night, which is like, I came with my dad."
"8521320","8523300"," I actually know his dad, or I kind of know his dad. "
"8523800","8524720"," I hung out with his dad a few times."
"8524900","8527100"," I actually went to a hockey game with his dad."
"8528280","8529600"," But it's something that they share. "
"8530980","8532960"," And his dad's getting older and he's kind of sick now."
"8533060","8534420"," Not sick, but not doing well."
"8536120","8539000"," And having his son still stay in his life. "
"8539740","8541380"," This guy's older, he's divorced."
"8542700","8544860"," And he still has his son and his life."
"8545580","8549560"," And they're able to spend time together, quality time, all that kind of stuff. "
"8549820","8551120"," So you can't give that stuff."
"8551240","8552020"," We're not giving that stuff up."
"8552120","8553140"," But what's the point of having kids?"
"8554940","8559280"," I guess if you don't get that enjoyment out of them, out of them when they're adults, right?"
"8560940","8562880"," And so we were talking about it last night. "
"8563200","8565000"," And I was like, you know what?"
"8565000","8565760"," I'm not going to stop by."
"8566020","8567780"," I was going to stop by last night and see him."
"8568300","8571920"," And I was like, I'm just going to stay home, hang out with your dad. "
"8571980","8574060"," But we talked about dads last night."
"8576360","8578300"," And we're almost there."
"8578420","8579260"," Just a little bit more here. "
"8579760","8581020"," A little bit tiny more."
"8581160","8582560"," I want to see that last little bit here."
"8583060","8585700"," A little bit of reversal candle here, but I want to see that. "
"8585880","8587620"," I want to see a little tiny bit there taking out."
"8590190","8593730"," Finally, seeing H Y G with the roll, trying to close its gap to the downside."
"8598820","8602520"," I think we get that two side that four, 17 to on on spy. "
"8604540","8607880"," See if we can push it down there and grab that that that four, 17."
"8614430","8617610"," And we're talking about his dad last night, you know, like hanging out with your dad."
"8618230","8620590"," And you know, they were just having guide guy night. "
"8621330","8622530"," They ride motorcycles together."
"8622770","8626550"," They go, as a matter of fact, they they offer me to go up all the time to."
"8627110","8631330"," They do always like dad and men's shit, like go to a cabin, go hiking, go biking. "
"8632070","8633230"," All kinds of cool stuff."
"8634010","8635870"," And I don't know Mike, my own daughters."
"8636530","8643670"," I hope that I hope that when they're adults, I can partake in their adult life where they want me"
"8643670","8645830"," to, of course, and I want to close their adult life. "
"8646070","8648450"," This is expected to cost around five trillion yen."
"8649450","8652350"," It does bring us now to 10 minutes away from the top of the hour."
"8652350","8655310"," A US is due to sell two year notes. "
"8655770","8661410"," So the private cover was two to 73 with the prior high yield of five spots, zero eight, five"
"8661410","8661730"," percent."
"8666710","8669970"," Come on, close that fucking gap, dude, seriously."
"8672840","8674760"," It's like watching fucking paint peel. "
"8716780","8718440"," Uh, what do we see what you guys are saying?"
"8725060","8727980"," First of all, it puts them slate of McCall's daughters are good for men."
"8728120","8728560"," Good for the soul."
"8728900","8729400"," Sons are good too. "
"8729560","8729820"," Just harder."
"8730300","8730380"," Yeah."
"8730920","8732180"," I like the daughters. "
"8732560","8732860"," I don't know."
"8733340","8735160"," Probably wouldn't be the best dad to a son."
"8736260","8738600"," My father was really fucking hard on me. "
"8738800","8742600"," I'm afraid that I would pass that on to my, I think I feel, not like, you know, it's not"
"8742600","8748000"," real, but I'm like, yeah, I probably wasn't giving sons for that reason."
"8748800","8750720"," It's probably wouldn't have been the best dad to a son."
"8753020","8754680"," I would be really hard on them. "
"8754800","8758760"," Although my wife is kind of hard on my daughters, but thankfully it's not me."
"8760060","8761700"," Having sons that I could be hard on."
"8764840","8768940"," I don't have, I don't have to do much to get a reaction of my disappointment to my daughters. "
"8771060","8774470"," Here comes that gap right now."
"8774570","8775750"," It's getting filled on SPX."
"8777910","8779430"," You can catch a bounce here. "
"8782670","8784510"," 4, 2, 1, 8, 7, 9."
"8787830","8791190"," You plan on imposing your ass off these little turds and getting rid of me."
"8793910","8796930"," The passing along wealth."
"8797470","8802730"," I like the idea of passing along wealth, but I think that's like a benefit, but not a feature. "
"8803910","8810590"," The one thing my dad was my dad specifically to me when I was young did not want to do"
"8810590","8811170"," that for me."
"8811170","8812890"," He didn't want to pass along any wealth to me."
"8813350","8815070"," He was like, get out there, do your own thing. "
"8816630","8818410"," Pull up your bootstraps son."
"8819410","8822770"," Put down that avocado toast and take care of yourself."
"8824890","8826530"," But that was really hard on me. "
"8827350","8837130"," Now my daughters, I'm hard on them, but I kind of feel like the young people are fucked today,"
"8837270","8839570"," so they can't really do that."
"8839570","8845330"," And I think I would do the same for my son today."
"8845530","8846190"," I think I would. "
"8846350","8850230"," I don't think I would ever treat my kids like my father treated me."
"8852470","8854550"," But I get why he did what he did with me."
"8855030","8856970"," A little bit more gap. "
"8857170","8858630"," Just a little tiny bit down here."
"8860430","8861090"," We're close."
"8861350","8862070"," We're almost there. "
"8862370","8865630"," Just a teeny teeny teeny tiny bit more over here."
"8870480","8877400"," My, uh, my, like, my father, man, he was, he was hard ass."
"8877780","8879780"," And I didn't like him for a long time. "
"8880160","8882900"," I ended up going back and apologizing to him."
"8883740","8885660"," Multiple times into my adulthood."
"8885660","8887800"," I realized what he did for me. "
"8888840","8891580"," I realized what he was doing for me."
"8893720","8894620"," Now as I get older."
"8896460","8899120"," I'm going to try to turn me into the demand that I am today. "
"8899440","8917410"," But, uh, at the time I did not like 15 fucking"
"8917410","8918150"," Delta dude."
"8918430","8919370"," Are you shitting me?"
"8926960","8929280"," I'm about to add some for 29."
"8929640","8933220"," I was going to do for 30 C's for Friday. "
"8933420","8936840"," They came down from 50 cents just now to 43 cents."
"8936840","8938300"," But I'm looking at four 29's."
"8938320","8939420"," Those are 58 cents. "
"8942160","8943820"," That's for October 27."
"8944260","8945340"," Time now at the top of the hour."
"8945600","8948620"," The US is due to sell 51 billion dollars in a two year note sale. "
"8949400","8950900"," A prior bid to cover was two to 73."
"8951380","8954360"," It would be prior high yield of five spot to zero eight to five percent."
"8954960","8959300"," So this week's auction cycle is starting with today's 51 billion dollar two year note sale. "
"8959720","8965040"," We'll be followed by auctions of 52 billion dollars in five year notes on Wednesday and 38 billion"
"8965040","8966820"," dollars in seven year notes on Thursday."
"8967740","8972240"," So worth noting the three billion dollar increase in this two year sale over the September auction"
"8972240","8976500"," offers potential headwinds, but a flight to quality backdrop remains."
"8977100","8983920"," And a large futures short in the tenor shown in shown by positioning data could support the demand"
"8983920","8984420"," as well. "
"8985100","8990360"," So JP Morgan strategist see the larger auction size requiring an additional concession versus"
"8990360","8993460"," Mondays closing level in order to be digested smoothly."
"8994220","8995060"," Almost there."
"8995180","8995580"," Almost there. "
"8995760","8997300"," And more doveish recent."
"8997880","8998340"," They speak."
"9002540","9008260"," So the aforementioned positioning data from the CFTC shows that speculators were net sure one spot"
"9008260","9013540"," three six million two year note futures, a record amount which may support the auction in terms of"
"9013540","9014460"," short covering flow. "
"9017820","9020220"," God, I want that one right fucking there, dude."
"9043720","9048720"," Added some 430 C's for October 27th."
"9052320","9055960"," I was going to go for 29, but I went with four fucking 30 so fuck it. "
"9057180","9059760"," So Friday for 30 C's."
"9062040","9067520"," I still think we close this shit out, but we're not we're in case they leave this little fucker"
"9067520","9068440"," behind back here."
"9070240","9076200"," So I'm long right now 430 C for October 27th. "
"9077560","9080260"," They could still reverse this and come back down here."
"9080360","9085760"," You could still see a little sneaky like squeeze up here and then boom deck back down and then off"
"9085760","9086260"," and running."
"9086520","9091160"," We also didn't tag S one yet either. "
"9092200","9094320"," Now, Vix is not showing."
"9095600","9100620"," The Vix is not really showing like doom and gloom though that stuff and then H Y G."
"9102460","9105480"," That's in relation to that two year note is just sitting there."
"9108200","9110220"," Just hustle in sideways right now. "
"9110220","9112700"," So you could still see a quick reversal here."
"9114520","9115800"," Bloodbath and then the bounce."
"9120100","9123320"," Sometimes they like to leave that little tiny bit though back back here. "
"9123440","9126000"," So we'll keep an eye on this and see if it reverses."
"9127180","9128580"," I'm going to bring that down."
"9132000","9133100"," That's fucking stupid. "
"9140490","9142830"," See if they tagged that last little bit down here."
"9152950","9156630"," But yeah, my kids like I want to be around like I don't know why you would have kids if"
"9156630","9159810"," you couldn't enjoy them right or have them in your life as you get older."
"9159810","9164990"," That's one of the things like if you're going to have kids like did you why did you have your"
"9164990","9165270"," kids. "
"9165770","9171590"," I guess you have some other motivations but for myself I had my kids because I like life."
"9172390","9176210"," And I want to share my life with them."
"9176890","9181230"," And then I also want to be there for them as they grow older and. "
"9182650","9186950"," I want to enjoy them as I go grow older and I guess that can be kind of greedy."
"9187330","9192310"," I was going to come out at the top of the auction results following a minute to two minutes after"
"9192310","9192670"," this."
"9195110","9200830"," Just a note here you had a bounce on waste management on their 153.70 right around there. "
"9200910","9202870"," I think it's trading 134.38 right now."
"9204670","9205110"," Microsoft."
"9205110","9210530"," Oh, that was almost too perfect right there. "
"9211650","9213310"," Check Microsoft really quick."
"9216310","9219670"," This is the one that I'm interested in."
"9221610","9225450"," Microsoft coming back down into not quite where it should"
"9225450","9235070"," be. "
"9236550","9243050"," Let's see if Microsoft can grab that lower end that 326.82. Usually when you shoot to you yield"
"9243050","9245650"," five spots 0.55% ahead of the auction."
"9246070","9253150"," So again pre so when you shoot you would have five spot to 0.55%. Seeing a reaction now to"
"9253150","9261260"," the upside on H.Y.G. Dixie going higher right now still."
"9262360","9265780"," Bounce on Apple bounce our big still trading higher now. "
"9265780","9273900"," Bounce on T.N.X. bounce on N.D.X. N.D.X. in a five minute look for for"
"9273900","9283260"," rejection above at 14 6 6 9.52. Maybe 6 7 3."
"9288880","9289680"," Green baby."
"9290960","9295980"," So my kids like I guess it's kind of kind of selfish right to say hey I want to have"
"9295980","9296600"," kids I want to."
"9297180","9300620"," Like I had a I fucking had a great life I'm like I want to I want my kids to"
"9300620","9301660"," have a great life and then. "
"9303080","9308880"," Maybe I'm like maybe it's kind of like selfish to be like yeah I want to also have kids so"
"9308880","9310900"," they have a great life but then so they spend time with me."
"9311280","9315500"," And then you know when you grow old if you don't have kids you have to create friendships and have"
"9315500","9318220"," family that'll be there with you."
"9319100","9323620"," Unless you're a person I guess I would understand completely except some friends that are like"
"9323620","9325740"," they're single and they like being single. "
"9325740","9328520"," They like solitary living and all that kind of stuff."
"9328920","9331580"," So I guess if I was that kind of person I probably wouldn't have had kids either."
"9331900","9334640"," So I understand that that want to need as well. "
"9339560","9344960"," What are your thoughts about having kids or you guys like kids or don't like kids or can't afford"
"9344960","9349260"," kids or want to be able to afford kids or you have kids or they're grown up."
"9349480","9354500"," They're not easy they're expensive they're not easy they take all of your time or at least all of"
"9354500","9357640"," my time they like encompass my entire life."
"9364060","9367380"," So you bid to cover ratio two to sixty four. "
"9367380","9368320"," You guys are putting up here."
"9369480","9372900"," I'm not getting YouTube comments again what the fuck is with YouTube dude."
"9374280","9377320"," It's a pyramid pass earnings play there's a two-year note option. "
"9377320","9381540"," You should put price here in one minute or so yep seems like 420 has to get 40 days."
"9381880","9383180"," Old dad's and that looks good."
"9383220","9384180"," Watch you guys watch that one. "
"9384320","9385580"," Twenty spot three three percent."
"9385660","9387020"," You need a female in most cases."
"9390660","9392160"," They'll leave in this gap down here. "
"9392240","9393080"," I don't like it right now."
"9393180","9394700"," I'm looking at this gap on on SPX."
"9394900","9395560"," I'm like this stream. "
"9395560","9396640"," I'm sponsored by it."
"9396740","9397580"," Damn it."
"9397600","9401320"," Ticks right allows you to actually hear water flowing futures for a sense. "
"9401620","9403260"," It just knocks that fucking gap out."
"9403500","9407160"," At ticksright.com trading 51 on 430 C right now."
"9407260","9408300"," It's looking pretty good. "
"9408320","9411100"," They're at forty four cents just a little while ago."
"9413930","9417090"," You got kids of the hardest thing in life but they're also the best part of life."
"9418330","9419690"," Nice little bounce down there. "
"9419790","9422390"," Let's see if they get this rejection of the downside or not an SPX."
"9422610","9423330"," I don't know if they will."
"9424190","9425650"," Not out of the woods yet for bulls. "
"9426130","9435500"," A little baby girl coming in."
"9435680","9437100"," Day now girls are awesome dude."
"9437480","9438300"," You're gonna love your daughters. "
"9440140","9442020"," Like baby girls are like the best."
"9442520","9444780"," Like the balls of joy and wonder."
"9448460","9449620"," Son is the greatest thing in my life. "
"9449760","9450700"," My social life and everything else."
"9450700","9451200"," Just enjoyable."
"9451280","9452980"," Life has been dead since he was born. "
"9453760","9454140"," Yeah."
"9454320","9457100"," There is some better sweetness to it too right."
"9457940","9459940"," And there is a lot of adjustments to lifestyle. "
"9461040","9465320"," You know one of the hardest things for my wife and I was one of the hardest things that we"
"9465320","9470140"," went through was all the adjustments as the kids grew up."
"9470320","9473480"," Of course when they're babies you can't do what you used to do."
"9473480","9477940"," Last up two spot two basis points around five spot zero eight three nine percent. "
"9478700","9480160"," Then there's a moment where."
"9481800","9485920"," You can do whatever you like you can cycle back into doing what you were doing before because"
"9485920","9486780"," they're not in school yet."
"9487120","9489760"," Like you want to go do this you want to go do that put it on back go here go"
"9489760","9490840"," there do all the stuff. "
"9491740","9495300"," But then they go back then they're like back in a child care and school."
"9496920","9500760"," And even right now our our life is."
"9500760","9505340"," I thought our life would get easier as our kids grew older. "
"9506080","9510660"," Keep your eye on this down here where there still could be more like still could be this more like"
"9510660","9511700"," bam to the downside."
"9512300","9513740"," And then that run higher."
"9515200","9519940"," So if you're still in botany thing here you still you still have a chance down here to possibly see"
"9519940","9520740"," this gap get closed. "
"9522860","9524300"," I thought it would get easier."
"9525180","9527600"," And as they're becoming young teenagers."
"9528460","9531260"," My like I got a pre team and then I got a."
"9531920","9532580"," A teenager. "
"9533360","9537280"," It's become more expensive and more time consuming than I ever expected."
"9539020","9543480"," How much time we're actually spending with them as they're becoming young adults."
"9544340","9549650"," I also got anywhere we got to say. "
"9551210","9557210"," Three daughters in their twenties raised them full time myself for 15 years they took my money."
"9558090","9563950"," I have five kids that's fucking awesome just in case I don't like half of them as adults I want"
"9563950","9564810"," to tell it."
"9567810","9573110"," That's what my my wife and I came from huge families like massive. "
"9574190","9580490"," Well, our said we don't I come from two siblings and she comes from three siblings so four and"
"9580490","9580830"," three."
"9581250","9582130"," That's seven."
"9583050","9587210"," But like my parents came from the mom came from 13. "
"9588330","9589390"," 13 kids."
"9589770","9593690"," And 13 kids are my mom side nine kids and my dad's."
"9594230","9598950"," And my wife comes from her parents come from two huge families as well. "
"9599790","9605910"," Like not 10 kids nine kids so we have like cousins everywhere and aunts and uncles everywhere."
"9607890","9609750"," If I could have afforded it."
"9611650","9613910"," If I could have afforded I would have had 10 kids. "
"9614790","9618110"," If my wife would have allowed me I don't know that she would have let me though."
"9619970","9622790"," I remember we had our first daughter and she said."
"9623910","9625270"," Or we had the one daughter right. "
"9626490","9628750"," And she was unexpected unplanned."
"9629990","9633310"," We didn't plan on having children we were like living our adult lives."
"9634050","9636850"," And having a blast and I got a pregnant. "
"9637390","9639530"," And we decided to keep her right."
"9640310","9643270"," And so he kept her and I remember."
"9644350","9648510"," I remember that we have an age disparity between our children. "
"9651570","9653030"," This terrible to say."
"9654150","9656290"," So even age disparity between our children."
"9657590","9661750"," And we had the one child and we were like scared right like we don't know what the fuck we're"
"9661750","9662010"," doing. "
"9662010","9665230"," We're going to do a good job bad job all that kind of stuff right."
"9665510","9667050"," We're like we're going to fuck this up."
"9667850","9668810"," And I remember. "
"9671030","9675970"," My oldest daughter is getting older right just like five six years old and."
"9676270","9681050"," She's like what around three to four to five we're like like looking at her and."
"9681490","9683390"," By like four years old. "
"9684410","9687630"," It's funny too so like I could get my wife pregnant."
"9688370","9690390"," Just looking at her boom pregnant."
"9690390","9696510"," And so that so this this baby is turning into its own little person. "
"9697630","9699410"," And we're looking at each other we're like."
"9700410","9703230"," Not that this is true but we're looking at each other like."
"9703890","9707790"," Dude we don't want to be raising just one child we're like she'll be she'll be a weirdo like she"
"9707790","9708710"," needs a she needs a buddy. "
"9709650","9710610"," She needs a friend."
"9711590","9716230"," We don't want her to go through life alone we're like maybe we should make it make a friend for"
"9716230","9716490"," her."
"9717410","9719430"," So we made like a sympathy child. "
"9721090","9724590"," For our oldest daughter at the time that was our logic."
"9725430","9728870"," And so like let's make a baby so that she has a companion."
"9730030","9735570"," And I love my first daughter so she loves our first daughter so helps to be great. "
"9736590","9739370"," So we had a second we attempted to have a second daughter."
"9740070","9744290"," And we had to we tried right here we're going to we're going to try for a daughter."
"9745310","9751830"," And it fucking didn't work we couldn't get pregnant it was like work trying to get pregnant it"
"9751830","9752410"," sucked. "

"9768010","9771930"," this lifestyle these positions this that and all the other stuff. "
"9772450","9777110"," And I remember I'll always remember this we we ended up having a."

"9786930","9793150"," We're having sex right like a it's like a forced hey right now this time this day. "
"9794230","9800510"," And we ended up having a fight over it like not like knockdown drag out but like anger and upset"
"9800510","9801410"," and frustration."
"9802190","9807670"," And disappointment and how can I not get you pregnant just by looking at you."
"9808210","9812770"," And the moment that we stopped by we were afraid we said we're not going to try to have a"
"9812770","9813910"," kid we're done. "
"9815350","9816410"," We're going to take a break from this."
"9817310","9820710"," And she was pregnant like boom boom pregnant."
"9821550","9826230"," Now the moment we took all the stress came off she got pregnant right away no big deal. "
"9826690","9830630"," And it was like a month later we knew she was pregnant that was it."
"9831110","9834910"," And so we had our well had the second sibling so the other one wouldn't be lonely."
"9836230","9838750"," But it turned out to be fucking awesome anyways so. "
"9842160","9844920"," Yeah I like the legacy stuff that's all like extra stuff right."
"9846640","9851220"," Taking care of them sucks yeah it's it you have to like adjust I think that has a lot to"
"9851220","9853000"," do with relationships in general."
"9854000","9857600"," I want to see this I'm checking this right here I want to keep my eye on this and see"
"9857600","9858340"," if there's that role. "
"9860920","9866760"," Right it's like one of the things about long relate so we're in a long relationship we didn't get"
"9866760","9868800"," there for a very long time and."
"9870440","9872900"," Now we didn't get together when we're young got together we're older."
"9874060","9876740"," Spent a lot of years without kids and. "
"9878100","9881760"," But we've been together for a long time and what's fascinating is."
"9883720","9887360"," One of the things about my wife and my children."
"9888460","9889860"," Is the ability to. "
"9891420","9893920"," Like whatever it's like be friends right."
"9894860","9899000"," But one of the reasons I think we're all still a tight family unit."
"9899460","9901680"," Is we've stayed. "
"9902780","9903460"," Interested."
"9903800","9906840"," In each other this includes the kids too."
"9907860","9910640"," As our likes and wants have changed. "
"9911740","9916180"," This includes if this is your husband your wife your kids whatever it is."
"9916780","9919500"," Yeah see this role right here watch this roll down here."
"9920600","9924440"," Still got this gap down here to close still got this gap down here. "
"9927310","9928870"," Up to pennies right now."
"9933010","9936150"," So the so like so this is like the word part is that you got."
"9938030","9942990"," If you want to know about success in relationships number one is friendship right you get along. "
"9943210","9946990"," You have commonalities common backgrounds to some extent."
"9948290","9953150"," Help is not getting required but it's it helps right to have some shared experience."
"9954670","9960410"," But what really matters like the thing that I notice matters to us is. "
"9960990","9964630"," Having interest in what other people are doing."
"9964710","9970410"," That might not be your interests are having the ability to have that shared."
"9970950","9973390"," Have that shared experience. "
"9973930","9978350"," So I'm going to explain this to you from the perspective of a child."
"9978430","9980090"," See that shit down there."
"9981170","9983150"," See all that garbage down there. "

"9987790","9989570"," Crap down here still not closed."
"9995280","9998020"," It's like the it's like the wife and the kids here are like. "
"9998680","10001660"," So I'm going to relate to children not the wife right now."
"10002140","10008240"," So my daughters are into specifically the oldest daughter she's into kpop."
"10009160","10011060"," And I have no interest in kpop. "
"10011060","10012240"," I'll be honest with you."
"10012320","10017920"," If you ask me hey you want to get involved in kpop I'm like fuck no."
"10019720","10021060"," It's not my jam. "
"10023260","10026780"," It's geared towards young teenage girls."
"10028060","10030520"," Now boys like it and people like it."
"10030760","10031340"," Dults like it. "
"10032600","10034260"," But it's not geared towards me right."
"10035000","10038940"," It's not built for me like a pop music in general young pop music."
"10038940","10047780"," Is a function believe it or not of you might not know this but pop music was born out of"
"10047780","10053240"," extra money that boomers when they were kids had. "
"10053560","10055460"," So if you're a World War II parent."
"10056240","10061760"," You had extra money right to build homes get a mortgage by a car all this other nonsense that was"
"10061760","10065760"," going on in the 1950s and 60s and you saw the rise of pop music."
"10065760","10072560"," And it was for kid their children to spend that money on pop music. "
"10073200","10078620"," That's the rise of pop music in the US specifically and like England places like that."
"10078980","10086440"," So kids have some spending money and these kids can spend spending money on pop music."
"10087040","10090480"," They can you can take dollars away from their parents these kids parents. "
"10091480","10095380"," So I'm not particularly keen on Korean kpop music."
"10095980","10100620"," But what I did do was I took an interest so my oldest daughter likes kpop."
"10100840","10105260"," So I started to learn the names of the boys and the bands started to listen to the music. "
"10105680","10109900"," I make fun of some of the songs just poking with my daughters but I listened to them."
"10109900","10110560"," I learned the words."
"10111100","10112660"," My daughter is asking me to go to these events. "
"10113360","10115820"," My daughter is asking me to take them to concerts and shows."
"10116320","10120380"," As a matter of fact two weeks ago or two or three weeks ago."
"10121420","10124640"," I was asked my daughter to a couple of things. "
"10126020","10129480"," There was a moment that my daughter said my oldest daughter said to me."
"10130040","10133760"," You actually know the words the song and the names of these people."
"10134300","10137640"," It was like a new song that came out that she hadn't talked to me about. "
"10138160","10141300"," And I had read an article about it and I listened to the song."
"10141300","10149860"," And she was shocked that I had taken my own time to find out what was going on with this"
"10149860","10150140"," band."
"10150800","10152000"," And she was shocked. "
"10152260","10154220"," She was like you actually care about what I care about."
"10154320","10155620"," And I was like fuck yeah I do you're my daughter."
"10156380","10160080"," And that meant something to her. "
"10160360","10162020"," It meant something to my oldest daughter."
"10163240","10170660"," She was it really did like how we had a deep emotional connection over my caring about that."
"10171980","10178160"," And recently she asked me to go to a Korean or not Korean. "
"10178620","10181840"," Just what we went up going to a Korean karaoke bar."
"10183280","10186780"," And normally she would be like yeah daddy you don't have to go to this stuff right."
"10187140","10187700"," So I wouldn't go. "
"10187900","10190440"," But now she's like hey dad I want you to come with me."
"10191280","10195360"," Like I need you to come with me to this karaoke thing that all these kids."
"10196800","10199180"," That's kids with adults but there's like a bunch of women. "

"10221420","10224580"," She wants me to go to the karaoke and be with her."
"10224580","10226520"," When she does that stuff. "
"10226840","10231180"," And you know that stuff like that's how you keep your kids involved in your life."
"10231440","10234500"," If you show interest in what they're doing."
"10234920","10237400"," Even if it's not something that you're not interested in. "
"10237500","10239320"," So if you're like hey my son and I share baseball."

"11034840","11040260"," Well let's look at the yeah so it is down there it actually isn't my target right now. "
"11041960","11042880"," Hold on here."
"11044120","11047100"," I got a target of it of 8028."
"11048600","11050120"," And 6981. "
"11052020","11058080"," So my target on TLT was 80.28 and we're fucking right there dude."
"11059640","11061600"," Still no reversal though."
"11063640","11065480"," What I would say is this. "
"11066600","11070340"," If you're looking for it's like a TLT."
"11071960","11073660"," Fuck it looks like a TLT right now."
"11074640","11077700"," Okay so we're going to switch over to trigger full screen. "
"11078680","11080040"," We're going to go to TLT."
"11083140","11086400"," We're going to look at one day."
"11091730","11094410"," So I'm going to see these yellow lines that I have here. "
"11096750","11098570"," Why are these important to me."
"11098850","11100590"," There's a couple things I want to show here in TLT."
"11101150","11102110"," So number one. "
"11104790","11106590"," Why do I like TLT here."
"11109390","11111030"," I measured this out."
"11113030","11117270"," But you've known demand down here at 8028 right. "
"11118470","11120050"," So known demand down here."
"11120750","11122410"," It's all known right."
"11122650","11128310"," I think I measured out that move down 6981 down there. "
"11130430","11131970"," What I buy TLT here."
"11132210","11135570"," I wanted to say something about this and I didn't and I should have."
"11136190","11139410"," And that is that if you look back on this even here. "
"11140750","11144670"," If you look back on this in the future like a year two years three years."
"11144990","11146810"," I don't think it's going to matter it's going to be up."
"11147270","11151530"," You look back like when we're when we're micro scoping TLT. "
"11152410","11153530"," It's not going to matter."
"11153730","11156510"," You're going to look back on like two three years of like I should have fucking bought right."
"11157890","11161210"," Now on what you want to be looking for in TLT here. "
"11162450","11164230"," Is for this right here."
"11164830","11165790"," At least on velocity."
"11167490","11169870"," You see all this velocity coming down the daily. "
"11169890","11172690"," This is the weekly velocity and this is the monthly velocity."
"11173470","11175130"," Even this bottoming down here."
"11175290","11176470"," This is a higher low right here. "
"11178010","11179710"," My thought process here would be."
"11180330","11180830"," Yeah."
"11181750","11185770"," If you set your sights on much farther down the road. "
"11187670","11190210"," Six months year two three years down the road."
"11191130","11194150"," You're going to look back on this and be like I should have bought that fucking dip right."
"11195250","11197130"," Can it go down to that 68 bucks?"
"11202790","11203270"," Absolutely. "
"11204110","11206330"," If you're looking for more short term."
"11207550","11210070"," There are better ways to express TLT."
"11210630","11211490"," There are double triple. "
"11211730","11215110"," You just got to bounce off that hourly trigger to see it on spoos."
"11216890","11218090"," Now TLT right."
"11218450","11219930"," Let's do the 30 minute here. "
"11220710","11222130"," So in the daily trigger it looks great."
"11222810","11223590"," Daily time frame."
"11223690","11224090"," Excuse me. "
"11225290","11226430"," In the 30 minutes."
"11227170","11228330"," That looks great as well."
"11228790","11230230"," Now saying that. "
"11233600","11235660"," TLT is above its hourly trigger."
"11236520","11237900"," That's a nice bounce right there."
"11238440","11239560"," Your target is 87. "
"11240700","11244540"," 87.55. So your target right now for TLT."
"11244660","11247380"," If you wanted something more short short term."
"11248660","11252980"," I would say get a triple leveraged way to express that trade to the upside. "
"11252980","11257000"," The trade that 87.55 price target."
"11257440","11263120"," Your target above that you're likely going to get some kind of sell to the downside from there."
"11263540","11264120"," All right. "
"11264280","11264900"," You'll see it right there."
"11265020","11268120"," You'll try to sell it back down to you or you break above it."
"11268540","11272600"," Start to consolidate the hourly comes up and starts to bring up to your second target. "
"11273400","11275040"," So like a triple leveraged option."
"11275220","11280660"," I would say take the money and run up here and then wait for it to get above the 87 "
"11280660","11285620",".55. And then you can trade the 95.80. That would be your range right there."
"11286320","11287600"," Somewhere down in here. "
"11288160","11289260"," And then consolidation."
"11289940","11292080"," Then that daily comes up and lifts you above here."
"11293000","11295320"," And you can rocket ship this to the upside. "
"11296060","11296300"," Yeah."
"11296400","11297160"," I like TLT here."
"11297340","11297640"," I do. "
"11297720","11298040"," I like it."
"11298140","11299340"," We're above the hourly trigger right now."
"11299520","11300660"," I love it on the. "
"11300900","11303380"," I love it on the."
"11304660","11305900"," Intraday I guess right now."
"11306020","11309020"," You don't want to be below 84 16 on TLT. "
"11309980","11311300"," Let's go back to spy."
"11313940","11315660"," Take a look at the one minute again."
"11325680","11327320"," See that bounce right now. "
"11327340","11330500"," You see that bounce right off off of this hourly trigger right here."
"11330760","11331880"," You see how we talked about."
"11332400","11333260"," Hey right there. "
"11334840","11337180"," Right came all the way up here bounced down."
"11337320","11339420"," Now what is what is a bull and a bear looking for."
"11339540","11340960"," We're going to talk about that right now. "
"11342100","11344960"," So what is a bull and a bear looking for a bull."
"11345160","11346900"," A bear is looking to sell this right."
"11346900","11349340"," We know that you can see sellers right here. "
"11350000","11352400"," Sellers are trying to say nope you're going down right."
"11354460","11356280"," So what does a bear need to see."
"11357480","11358340"," They want to see. "
"11360060","11361080"," A failure."
"11362500","11363640"," To make a new high."
"11367820","11369120"," Come back down here. "
"11370800","11371320"," Right."
"11371580","11372960"," And then one more failure right here."
"11373780","11379420"," And then the reversal to the downside this will be bad for bulls. "
"11379420","11382240"," If you see something like this not good."
"11382560","11386460"," So come up down right failure to get the new high."
"11386580","11389800"," Come back down here and then start that reversal to the downside. "
"11390460","11391320"," Hasn't happened yet."
"11394500","11403400"," If you are a bear and you see price not fail here right."
"11403640","11404280"," Comes up here. "
"11406100","11407480"," Gets that new high."
"11407480","11409680"," It begins to break to the upside."
"11409840","11413300"," You see that cross happen here on the one in five minute trigger. "
"11413580","11414200"," Get out of the way."
"11414800","11418820"," It's going to rip to the rip to new highs on the intraday."
"11418980","11421440"," So just watch this closely right here. "
"11422040","11425100"," Not quite a bull cross yet but almost going to become one."
"11425720","11427020"," We're just waiting for it to happen."
"11427180","11428800"," You'll have a four trigger clock three trigger cluster. "
"11429920","11433480"," And we'll try to ramp this to the upside right now."
"11433860","11435160"," See if this can work out for itself."
"11435160","11436960"," Bam, bam, bam and get up there. "
"11441100","11442540"," Pay close attention here."
"11443140","11445040"," Still I got whole bunch of longs."
"11445140","11446900"," I got longs for I got zero to eight longs. "
"11446980","11448320"," I got Friday longs."
"11459860","11461720"," You want to talk about Tesla we can."
"11462560","11463960"," You want to talk some Tesla. "
"11465400","11468880"," I pissed off Tesla bulls last week telling them that I was bearish on Tesla."
"11469720","11472760"," Tesla bull says there's no way it's going down there and it fucking did."
"11474480","11476120"," You guys want what you guys want to talk Tesla. "
"11476840","11480360"," You guys want to have Tesla like we should have like a Tesla 15 minute every day."

"11598400","11599700"," Hold on a second here."
"11602440","11603340"," Not necessarily. "

"11696600","11697320"," These are the targets. "
"11697560","11698920"," These are the current targets for Tesla."
"11699580","11700500"," Now that's true."
"11700700","11700980"," That's real. "
"11701340","11702380"," You know that you don't think so, but."
"11703100","11703640"," It is."
"11705160","11706120"," A minimum. "
"11707360","11708760"," Now saying that."
"11709560","11711320"," It doesn't have to go down here."
"11711320","11713140"," Okay, does not have to do this. "
"11714080","11719880"," And it's not going to be easy getting down there and it's going to take the daily trigger to do"
"11719880","11720040"," it."
"11721420","11725000"," So I want to express this better and a better way to hear."
"11726540","11728740"," This is what the sellers need to do. "
"11732000","11733360"," They need the help."
"11734460","11735780"," It's not that easy."
"11735780","11737360"," You're not going to sell off earnings. "
"11737360","11740100"," And just go straight to the dumpster fights."
"11740200","11741280"," It does not going to happen."
"11741380","11741580"," I'm sorry. "
"11741680","11742700"," I apologize if you're a bear."
"11742780","11747500"," If you think that now a bull though is going to think, oh, we're going to bounce in and race"
"11747500","11748980"," right out of here like nobody's business."
"11749020","11750280"," That's not true either. "
"11751300","11755040"," The sellers need to have the initial blast off down right."
"11755800","11759420"," Sellers going to need the help of the daily trigger cross up here."
"11760000","11761380"," To get those new lows. "
"11765120","11767200"," They need this to cross over here."
"11767200","11770860"," And some form of rejection up in here."
"11771060","11774220"," See that start ripping face down below. "
"11774700","11781060"," Bulls are not out of any kind of danger unless they're able to get above and then consolidate for"
"11781060","11781580"," the run higher."
"11782140","11783640"," So you got a lot of work as a bull."
"11783840","11784560"," You got a ton of work. "
"11784820","11789100"," I would say to you that as a Tesla bull."
"11789940","11791840"," Yeah, you can you can trade this."
"11792620","11793800"," Like you can trade this right now. "
"11793800","11799940"," You can you can take this up to two twenty six eighty five two thirty five fifty five two forty"
"11799940","11800440"," six fifty."
"11800700","11802060"," But they're waiting for you as my point."
"11802880","11805960"," They're they're waiting for you up here to send you the depths of hell. "
"11806160","11808240"," This is all going to be a rough road volatility."
"11809040","11811980"," Is the name of the game for bulls here."
"11812720","11814540"," And then likely some consolidation. "
"11815820","11816500"," If you do."
"11817900","11818700"," Some consolidation."
"11818900","11820920"," Let me mute this camera over here because you can't see. "
"11823040","11824060"," You can't see this."
"11824840","11825960"," I need you to see it."
"11827340","11828480"," So see this right here. "
"11829880","11831020"," See all this right here."
"11831140","11832780"," You can close that gap in there if you want."
"11833640","11834620"," But even if you do. "
"11835180","11838380"," It leaves a whole question of womb."
"11838560","11838700"," Okay."
"11838820","11839160"," So we're up here. "
"11839240","11839780"," We're going to do now."
"11840300","11842900"," It leaves all this consolidation in here."
"11843160","11844220"," Even if you're going to go up. "
"11845820","11850500"," So be conscious that you're likely going to be stuck trading this zone right here."
"11851080","11851420"," Okay."
"11852120","11855260"," And then you're going to need the hourly trigger to come up and help you out. "
"11855280","11858260"," You're going to need the weekly to help you out."
"11858500","11859280"," The daily to help you out."
"11859340","11862140"," The daily is going to come down here and help you out as well. "
"11862880","11863300"," So."
"11865500","11866940"," Yeah, you can take that trade."
"11867240","11870280"," You have to cut it loose below two fifteen eighty nine. "
"11871320","11877440"," If you're a bull two eighty nine and then I would expect I would expect like ping pong."
"11878760","11880220"," And this is the finger trap."
"11880260","11881100"," Don't get caught in this. "
"11881160","11881660"," Don't get caught."
"11882220","11884260"," Like you can be a buyer down here to go up here."
"11884420","11886120"," You can be a seller over here to get over there. "
"11886580","11892320"," But don't be caught long or short unless you have a break below these two things or rejection."
"11893240","11893780"," Makes sense."
"11894420","11898520"," So two key numbers for you as a bull and a bear two key numbers for you. "
"11898520","11903980"," Is going to be two forty six fifty two twenty six eighty five."
"11905420","11907060"," Now whether you reject."
"11908420","11909640"," Let's do it this way. "
"11913500","11916360"," Whether you reject this box here or drop."
"11916560","11919540"," Maybe we can make this simple or simple or."
"11922930","11925210"," Make this white or gray. "
"11925410","11925950"," I guess that works."
"11926150","11926470"," Great works."
"11928630","11930690"," Let's make it a trans translucent. "
"11933850","11935710"," You can snap this here if you want."
"11938390","11938830"," Okay."
"11940110","11941990"," Do a little snap for yourself at home. "
"11946080","11948340"," And what you need to know here is."
"11950560","11952180"," You know let's say you come up in here right."
"11952420","11956040"," You don't want to be long here because you can get the rejection of the continuation of the"
"11956040","11956240"," downside. "
"11957860","11959720"," Now you can take that long there."
"11960520","11963620"," You don't want to if you start to see this happen you're going to get short right."
"11965660","11969320"," But if price breaks up into here in holds. "
"11971000","11973320"," You're then stuck with trading this zone."
"11973660","11974220"," Does that make sense."
"11975320","11976640"," Until a decision is made. "
"11978120","11980320"," So you can only like trade this inside this box."
"11980680","11983820"," Now you can't get like Max you can't like take a short here."
"11984500","11989760"," And just hold it expecting that to happen because it could reverse back up on you right. "
"11990000","11990220"," Makes sense."
"11991160","11994700"," You can trade inside here but you can't get like conviction trading in here."
"11995780","12001840"," Now if price does come up in here we bounce up and down and it resolves to the downside. "
"12002500","12004520"," Yeah you can do a conviction trade there."
"12005500","12011040"," If it resolves to the upside breaks above and you get the daily trigger helping you out in the"
"12011040","12012060"," alley trigger helping you out."
"12012340","12014440"," And it resolves to the upside you can then take that. "
"12015020","12022020"," That conviction trade above to the upside to clear all this crap out back here and try to get some"
"12022020","12022460"," new highs."
"12023160","12027220"," So this box right here that I'm showing is the simplification of this right."
"12029500","12031900"," Is the like the zone for you. "
"12031900","12033640"," A very important for you to understand this zone."
"12033880","12036540"," Now I will say something to you on a 30 minute time frame."
"12037140","12038020"," This looks gorgeous. "
"12038420","12039660"," This looks kind of okay."
"12040340","12040660"," Okay okay."
"12041660","12042980"," But that one right there looks gorgeous. "
"12043820","12048040"," So maybe we come up here right trade 226.85 bounce back down."
"12048940","12051880"," You get the hourly trigger to help you get inside the box."
"12052360","12054540"," Once you're inside the box you're trading this. "
"12055420","12058240"," Meanwhile as the days pass these come down here right."
"12058800","12064980"," And they pick you up to grab you to go up here and trade that 247.50. Maybe you get"
"12064980","12068040"," another rejection the hourly comes back up and the daily comes back up."
"12068380","12069920"," And that's the power move right there. "
"12070360","12074640"," That 235 or so right in there is the power move for you if you're a bull to the upside."
"12075380","12077340"," But this whole zone in here be careful of this."
"12077340","12079960"," This is like very this is all day territory. "
"12080920","12084560"," In here like this is the this is the finger trap for bulls right here."
"12085740","12087140"," That's Tesla for you."
"12091300","12094280"," Okay Tesla did that did that one. "
"12100460","12102760"," No S one yet for the bears."
"12104660","12109960"," Bears thinking that we were heading lower bears thinking that they were going to rain on the bull"
"12109960","12110960"," parade this morning."
"12112260","12118520"," Just just trying to grab some liquidity just trying to get some stops just trying to get everybody"
"12118520","12119640"," all beared up. "
"12121320","12131100"," Manipulation Tuesdays have a full cross coming up right here."
"12131460","12134320"," Bears with no will to go down right here."
"12135400","12138340"," Gonna expect this trade right here to happen. "
"12138720","12141760"," Get above this come back down and then wham to the upside."
"12147520","12148660"," Get out of the way bears."
"12151720","12157160"," You should see this trade and then that trade to the upside. "
"12157980","12162320"," I guess if you're guess I don't sit do whatever you guys want out there not financial advice."
"12164900","12166240"," Not financial advice."
"12171480","12172920"," Yeah we'll call it test talk. "
"12173300","12174180"," I like that test talk."
"12175360","12175840"," Shit."
"12180500","12182980"," The only child had an emptiness in his heart. "
"12183140","12186240"," I had all toys in the world just wanted a little bro then got him and he started taking all"
"12186240","12186660"," my toys."
"12187260","12188900"," Like the errors of my wish."
"12190520","12195860"," And sis the dude that's a great description brother or a woman or sister whoever you are they are"
"12195860","12196060"," them. "
"12202540","12204720"," Oh my god 18 kids fuck."
"12208120","12213920"," My dude so I said my dad I said my mom came 13 my mom came from nine."
"12214100","12215660"," It was my dad that came from 13. "
"12216720","12220860"," My dad told stories of the two so my dad right."
"12222920","12229220"," My dad told stories of when when my dad and his siblings became teenagers."
"12231660","12235540"," To like so my my grandfather worked two jobs. "
"12237540","12243500"," And my my father and his siblings they would feed the kids in."
"12244520","12251360"," Waves like one wave of kids second wave of kids and then my grandfather ate alone."
"12252240","12257860"," And my dad never got to know his dad my dad's father worked his whole life never stopped working"
"12257860","12258880"," and died young. "
"12261120","12262900"," And really fucked my dad up."
"12262940","12268100"," As a matter of fact he died when my father was in Vietnam and they didn't tell my dad he"
"12268100","12269280"," had to find out from the military."
"12270160","12272020"," And it was really fucked up from my father. "
"12277800","12280400"," Oh dear for porting that Israel states to."
"12280560","12281420"," Thanks for the heads up."
"12281540","12284880"," I got a bunch of calls man I got a bunch of Friday for 30s I got a bunch of"
"12284880","12285880"," four 30s for the. "
"12286640","12290620"," I got four 30s for today zero dates I got four 30s for Friday."
"12291880","12295100"," I'm expecting that like after our spike to the upside."
"12296440","12297500"," Thanks for the heads up man. "
"12297660","12298440"," So Crirolo just said."
"12300160","12303220"," Market up scenario if you can avoid major structure by the first week of November."
"12305780","12310700"," Yeah they we lost our we my father lost us siblings we lost one sibling when he was young. "
"12311660","12314880"," And then over the years of course we lost multiple siblings."
"12323130","12326530"," I thought it so the market up scenario started yesterday."
"12329030","12329890"," Not today. "
"12331670","12333950"," That's it began yesterday began on Monday."
"12335370","12337450"," What happened was last week Crirolo."
"12338910","12343750"," Is they had a stop hunt that began on Wednesday I believe Tuesday or Wednesday to the downside. "
"12343750","12349810"," And they got that big fat print they got the big fat print and bonds they have the big fat"
"12349810","12351190"," print the downside in a Friday."
"12354510","12360590"," And then the real trade was on Monday to the upside so Monday was the day he should have been"
"12360590","12362090"," long found a low."
"12363610","12369130"," And I don't know how long the only thing that I would not I would be tacit about. "
"12369130","12373090"," On that opinion that you read."
"12374590","12378330"," The only the only caveat I would say here is or."
"12379150","12384630"," The only caveat well just so okay so I said this I have some people know this and some people"
"12384630","12385030"," don't. "
"12385330","12389270"," Some of the shit I don't say publicly to anyone even in the discord anybody because I don't want"
"12389270","12389370"," to."
"12389650","12394610"," I don't have people trading trading this stuff and being like hey cap fuck you."
"12395070","12398210"," So if it doesn't go that way now. "
"12400110","12403370"," This is the time for you to place your Christmas trade okay."
"12405750","12411190"," You should this is the time they not financial advice do not follow my advice."
"12414100","12416120"," Matter of fact fuck it I said it so. "
"12418500","12420260"," I'll say I'll say it publicly okay."
"12432300","12433980"," I haven't said it everywhere."
"12452390","12453470"," There said it. "
"12464830","12466050"," Okay so I made it public."
"12468190","12469690"," There's some caveats to that."
"12471870","12476370"," It's like the holiday trade started yesterday that people are going to get pissed even saying that. "
"12477590","12480210"," Lasted into December 31st."
"12483850","12489610"," Saying that though there are material risks to the downside to the market in that holiday trade not"
"12489610","12490490"," playing itself out."
"12490490","12492350"," They can definitely go against. "
"12493190","12498550"," The crash trade that you guys are all talking about the past five days past I was longer now right"
"12498550","12499710"," past seven or eight sessions."
"12499990","12506610"," The black market holiday massacre I don't know that holiday mass the black Friday black Monday in"
"12506610","12508690"," 1987 all that stuff."
"12509250","12512210"," Yeah like is there more downside possibilities yes. "
"12513230","12519330"," But in and around in around even last week the trade was viable even with the move down last week."
"12519330","12524550"," For like a December 31st or if you want to find out how you structure the construction for January"
"12524550","12527030"," and closing in December but."
"12529110","12534110"," That's all valid the only my personal or my two issues that I have with the trade. "
"12535270","12541210"," There's always risk with that trade right but the two that concerns that I have is the first one"
"12541210","12541630"," would be."
"12543110","12545110"," My first concern is."
"12549630","12553070"," I wear these to express these concerns. "
"12553650","12556330"," The legality of Israeli occupation of Gaza."
"12559190","12561670"," The first one that I want to say is."
"12562170","12563990"," There's three missponsored by to the. "
"12564090","12566090"," Absolutely get free daily points."
"12566470","12571090"," The banachi and market profile levels by signing up to the tick dot com."
"12571450","12572870"," Like there's absolutely. "
"12576530","12580910"," There's an inherent risk to the market from banks and."
"12582830","12584870"," As we saw this whole year right."
"12585410","12587850"," Let's go back to October to today okay. "
"12588530","12591750"," It's whole year we've talked about October of last year."
"12591930","12593110"," It's about over last year."
"12595410","12598550"," We knew and know that. "
"12599630","12603910"," Or at least I know that we I guess I've always said."
"12604550","12610670"," That I expect at some point into spring of 2024 maybe summer."
"12611570","12617610"," To go back down and recheck that October low of 2022. "
"12620230","12623350"," That and that that's all a function of."
"12623990","12627970"," The end of rate increases the rise of unemployment."
"12629010","12632450"," A bottoming of inflation true or not. "
"12634250","12637690"," It's an inflation trade rate GDP sliding off."
"12640510","12645410"," We've talked that if you've been the stream for with for me for years now you know this trade."
"12645410","12648350"," And we almost always do it. "
"12648490","12652130"," So you go back and you check right now there's a mechanic in here where."
"12652730","12657250"," There's a mechanic in here where the for what Jerome said this last."
"12658930","12661230"," Showed and said in this last rate increase. "
"12661730","12662650"," There's a disagreement."
"12663130","12665010"," There's even analysts out there."
"12665070","12666430"," I read you some analyst comments yesterday. "
"12667170","12667890"," This isn't me."
"12668050","12668990"," This is like professionals."
"12670590","12674510"," And even their professional opinion is they're calling out. "
"12674510","12676350"," The Fed and saying fuck you you're not."
"12676510","12680830"," There's no way you're going to have higher rates for longer into December of 2024."
"12681750","12682970"," That all ain't happening. "
"12683470","12686450"," So there's likely like a positioning from banks here."
"12687170","12691550"," To say fuck you we're going to we're going to front run this shit on you into spring and summer"
"12691550","12692630"," of 2024."
"12693330","12696050"," And we'll see if you're fucking still raising rates then. "
"12696570","12697510"," You know what I'm saying."
"12697510","12702250"," And you'll the mechanics of this is where unemployment's rising to five six percent."
"12702590","12706290"," Into into the summer fall and winter of 2024. "
"12707070","12710690"," And he's hammer away raising rates or threatening you."
"12711070","12715890"," The reality is they're going to be chasing as price goes down."
"12716630","12719770"," And trying to cut rates as that destruction happens. "
"12720670","12726510"," Now they the banks also tend to front run these things and try to guess second or not second guess"
"12726510","12726870"," it but."
"12727650","12732650"," They try to start it before it's going to happen right so you've got analysts out there that are"
"12732650","12732810"," like."
"12733270","12733570"," Hey. "
"12734210","12739790"," Where are we at right now it's October 24th right so the clock is ticking for a bull."
"12740630","12742530"," For that to happen in 2024."
"12743230","12745990"," And so that's likely to happen so. "
"12749090","12753270"," That caveat would be does it happen sooner than later or later than sooner."
"12753770","12757270"," It's it's not something that's predefined like oh it's going to happen on February."
"12757490","12761110"," It's going to happen in April or where the where that those targets are. "
"12762290","12765770"," So can we have like a Christmas rally from here in 10 of year."
"12765970","12766150"," Sure."
"12767550","12771950"," Temper your expectations and then do I expect some kind of a roll down and next year I still do. "
"12772410","12774190"," I don't expect them to be raising rates."
"12774930","12779190"," Into December of 2024 no matter what the fuck it tells you I don't because I see unemployment"
"12779190","12782550"," raising or rising into December of 2024."
"12782550","12784710"," I see a bottom to inflation. "
"12785090","12792630"," I see those GDP sliding off slightly and analysts are telling you that same thing regardless if"
"12792630","12797810"," it's a mild no recession or not we're going to go back and check those that fucking low in October."
"12798170","12805610"," It's not guaranteed but it's I mean if we break above the previous high from December of 2022 right"
"12805610","12809930"," we're still going to go back and check it once one more time even if it's just a touch and"
"12809930","12810670"," go into the upside."
"12811130","12814390"," We didn't get it this year right we didn't break a new high right now. "
"12814970","12819330"," We didn't get the new high to even come back and check the pre that previous high of right now"
"12819330","12820490"," in December of 2022."
"12821870","12823570"," Just touch and go and move forward."
"12823610","12827250"," We're being rejected right now in the previous high of December of 2022. "
"12828210","12833870"," So likely likely one way or another we're going to do that some kind of a function of that in"
"12833870","12834410"," 2024."
"12835350","12840610"," Some kind of a function of that whether it's whether it's a new all time high from 2020 December"
"12840610","12841110"," 2022."
"12842150","12843530"," Let me explain this better to you. "
"12843570","12845630"," Let me let me show it to you in a better way."
"12846010","12846610"," Hold on here."
"12850790","12851670"," A new layout. "
"12854230","12855730"," Let me express this in a better way."
"12855770","12860290"," If you guys understand about accumulation distribution simplify this for you okay."
"12863850","12867090"," This is with nothing on it just an SPX chart. "
"12868010","12873990"," Real simple here gather around young traders old traders can follow me and all this stuff."
"12875070","12878730"," You're a young trader you probably don't know this."
"12881750","12884450"," So previous high back here in SPX right. "
"12886350","12891730"," There's a couple likelihood scenarios you we trade up you get the new high right."
"12891730","12892950"," Whoop right there."
"12895190","12898330"," And you recheck it and continue higher. "
"12900390","12900670"," Okay."
"12901870","12902850"," Or call me."
"12905510","12906370"," Hold on here. "
"12915600","12917740"," Rather than talking about it we'll just show it."
"12918060","12919600"," We'll fucking make it crayons."
"12920640","12922200"," This is the previous high right here. "
"12923620","12926900"," First scenario is where you fail to make a new high."
"12927880","12931860"," And you actually just begin to go down and retest these previous lows okay."
"12933740","12939920"," This scenario likely and historically does not end right there. "
"12940760","12942880"," It actually you actually have finding a new low."
"12943680","12944600"," It's very common okay."
"12945700","12948820"," Very very common if you if you fail to make the new high. "
"12951960","12958480"," Now scenario number two is where now even with this failure you actually go up there and make that"
"12958480","12958900"," new high."
"12959940","12961300"," Okay you get above it."
"12962580","12966360"," Now what we do from this point here right is two fold. "
"12966920","12971320"," This is the touch and go you touch and you go to new highs."
"12972200","12976400"," The second scenario here is you get the new high and you don't do the touch and go you actually"
"12976400","12976820"," reject."
"12976820","12980160"," And you only retest this previous low. "
"12980600","12983640"," You actually don't retest you you actually read above it."
"12983960","12985780"," And you then you're off and running."
"12986640","12990220"," This is the whole like trough scenario here right you get the trough. "
"12990780","12992700"," You break above it boom you're gone right."
"12994580","12997460"," So those are the kind of scenarios you have in front of you."
"12998020","12998360"," Okay. "
"12999900","13000460"," Now."
"13001600","13006960"," Right now these bears wants that down scenario right filled make the new high right any kind of"
"13006960","13011700"," retest the upside is just going to be continuation of the downside down oh sorry I'm fucking that"
"13011700","13012200"," all up."
"13013080","13017620"," So right now these bears are telling you didn't you failed to get the new high that that leads to"
"13017620","13023000"," not only three tests down here but new lows needing to be found now. "
"13023640","13027340"," There's a front running action to this happening right now there's an expectation."
"13027340","13027880"," There's an expectation."
"13033180","13035520"," For next year here is December. "
"13041720","13044100"," There's December right there right there's an expectation."
"13045680","13051060"," You're going to have your February low over here somewhere in your April low somewhere over here"
"13051060","13055620"," right there's an expectation well fuck it let's get it on right now or even if you're going to get"
"13055620","13059280"," up there you're still going to get out there and see that in that that time period."
"13060060","13060580"," Right. "
"13061680","13068040"," And that this whole this whole this whole idea here is they either get it going right now or when"
"13068040","13074420"," does it happen right this happened after January because it becomes something where you have your"
"13074420","13078980"," holiday rally failure right to get that new high into January and February."
"13078980","13087160"," And then you actually see that that down quarter and fit and get February bounce April bounce and"
"13087160","13091180"," then we're off and running and then there's a bigger fear here that if we don't get that new high."
"13092120","13098760"," That even in January and April you would see another failure and twenty twenty four would be"
"13098760","13103080"," fucking ugly like straight up ugly to the downside over here. "
"13103080","13109360"," You can kiss all that shit away without that new high up here you can kiss the bounce and go"
"13109360","13110460"," in springtime."
"13110860","13115780"," Now there'll be a front there's an attempt at front running this right now right you see it you can"
"13115780","13119940"," see the attempt at front running this and that's what they don't want they don't want to front run"
"13119940","13121360"," and get squeezed out right."
"13122280","13127320"," And then actually have it happen and then you're off and running up into the right so. "
"13129900","13132420"," My first my first caveat on."
"13134340","13135840"," This has to do with."
"13136380","13140220"," My first caveat on hey should be good to go from here. "
"13140880","13146240"," I guess I guess you could say yeah you're good to go here but where is here and where does"
"13146240","13148740"," it end does it end in December or whatever."
"13149900","13152440"," And I don't know what to say to you on that."
"13159510","13160350"," Leave that. "
"13162010","13163290"," Leave that right there."
"13163410","13165410"," Let's get back to this one close that one out."
"13171600","13177320"," So why am I this is where the second caveat comes in the second problem that I have right now"
"13177320","13183820"," is some of these tickers are set up to sell the news right. "
"13183820","13185920"," So like you saw it in financials."
"13186200","13187500"," I'm seeing it like Google."
"13188080","13188800"," Seeing it in Amazon. "
"13189280","13190160"," Seeing it like Apple."
"13190580","13193140"," Seeing it in those these companies that should not be there."
"13194200","13199520"," Like there should be there should be like this idea that we can run up into December and I'm not"
"13199520","13202180"," seeing that in this earning season. "
"13202500","13208120"," I'm not seeing like hey I'm not seeing it in social media."
"13208380","13209000"," I'm not seeing it."
"13209720","13213400"," Seeing some of the analysts say it but I'm not seeing it where people are like hey you know what"
"13213400","13215780"," we sold down into this ER season. "
"13216020","13220620"," You should be buying all these fucking companies on a low and holding them into end of year."
"13221800","13227500"," And hey we're expecting like whatever low we have in springtime or late winter is going to be"
"13227500","13231200"," higher than the lows that you've seen in this correction in the fall."
"13231900","13233280"," Like not seeing any of that stuff. "
"13233280","13238760"," There's a lot of like you know and then you get the banks trying to front run this whole entire"
"13238760","13239800"," move in 2024."
"13241820","13243640"," You get the fucking Fedtown."
"13243640","13247420"," You're going to go higher for longer and I'll like to show you five year 10 year charts. "
"13248200","13252740"," You know that you know it's hard."
"13252900","13257720"," It's hard to say like a temper the bullishness maybe."
"13259260","13260300"," Those are my fears. "
"13260520","13261820"," I guess if I had fears that's what they are."
"13265200","13266620"," Can Bitcoin be similar?"
"13269840","13270800"," Yeah absolutely."
"13271260","13272920"," Fuck yeah Bitcoin can be similar. "
"13273240","13277940"," So like when you when you look back on these mechanics like if we look back on this in three"
"13277940","13282900"," years, five years, it'll be all you'll see all these these mechanics will play out."
"13283060","13285540"," It'll be an expectation that these mechanics play out."
"13286260","13292140"," The only way that they wouldn't play out or the whammy would be that Jerome is not lying. "
"13292930","13294440"," If Jerome is not lying."
"13295320","13299840"," If Jerome is serious and the banks are wrong, right?"
"13302060","13307900"," You will actually see a grind sideways and continuation to the upside for could be years."
"13308640","13313660"," You could see like a dead not a dead market but like a like a like a slow grind up"
"13313660","13318580"," sideways and up for multiple years one, two, three, four, five years. "
"13318580","13323620"," Like a lost like a just a lost market for promote."
"13323640","13325400"," That's the that's the Volcker scenario."
"13325400","13328780"," That's a 1960s 1970s type scenario. "
"13328960","13329680"," You just keep grinding."
"13330060","13330760"," You have a pullback."
"13330780","13331400"," You have a correction. "
"13331400","13333680"," You grind pullback and a correction."
"13335540","13336900"," I don't know."
"13337000","13338120"," I don't know if that happens. "
"13338120","13339220"," That scenario happens."
"13339800","13341660"," I don't trust the politics."
"13342280","13345120"," I don't trust the greed that people have. "
"13345120","13351480"," I don't trust the greed of banks to force that that that hey let's go back down there again."
"13352800","13358640"," But all these mechanics at play right now we're condensing in time like time is burning."
"13359880","13360020"," Right. "
"13360560","13364940"," Time is burning like time was going against the bears and and late 2022."
"13365460","13370100"," The Fed was fucking the bears with time and right now the bulls are starting down a path."
"13370900","13374820"," They're beginning their journey of payment time's not on your side brother. "
"13376660","13381700"," So you know the bears the bulls don't have a lot of time for this stuff to play out next"
"13381700","13381980"," year."
"13382120","13386600"," So I don't know like I have mixed feelings on it."
"13386620","13389880"," If you're saying till middle of the or being in November, I think that's fine. "
"13391020","13391820"," Middle of November."
"13392080","13392500"," That's fine."
"13392620","13398600"," But yeah, it's a tough one right now. "
"13398960","13400700"," It's it's a tough one to see right now."
"13403640","13408540"," Christmas play grind sideways and up into good question."
"13408560","13409100"," You want to see it?"
"13409240","13409720"," I'll show it to you. "
"13409780","13410500"," You want to see the Christmas play?"
"13410860","13411560"," I'll show it to you right now."
"13412180","13412760"," Hold on here."
"13412960","13413820"," I'll show you the Christmas play. "
"13415040","13416380"," I posted it yesterday."
"13419490","13420350"," Hold on here."
"13422810","13425950"," I posted it without you even seeing it didn't I right here. "
"13427010","13433160"," A second here."
"13433240","13433660"," I'll show you guys."
"13441900","13442700"," It's right here. "
"13442980","13444720"," This isn't this isn't too hard to see."
"13444860","13444960"," Right."
"13445720","13446700"," What about marker on this?"
"13448420","13451240"," This new fucking image thing sucks. "
"13458470","13458910"," Okay."
"13459150","13460190"," So watch this right here."
"13460310","13460430"," Okay. "
"13461550","13462830"," On this markup right here."
"13463710","13466590"," So you got your first low right here for a slow right there."
"13466590","13469230"," You're coming into your next low right now. "
"13469370","13469530"," Right."
"13469950","13472330"," So you should be coming in here."
"13472810","13473290"," Right. "
"13473450","13476010"," And trying to buy this like call spreads in here."
"13476770","13477250"," Right."
"13478030","13480050"," Then you got your you got your little bit. "
"13480150","13484070"," This is probably December 1st or something like that."
"13484310","13488030"," And then you'll have a zero date play into the third not zero yet."
"13488270","13491290"," Personally, I believe that's zero dates in the end of year. "
"13491790","13496490"," But right now you should be buying like call spreads for your for your holiday rally."
"13496630","13497430"," Do you see it right there?"
"13498030","13499010"," Fair fairly simple."
"13499230","13499310"," Right. "
"13499750","13501750"," Now what is this expectation here?"
"13502110","13503650"," Into end of year is a big question mark."
"13505310","13507830"," Do you just do like something that's in the money?"
"13508070","13509350"," Is it something where you do it in the money?"
"13509870","13510450"," Where we at?"
"13510650","13511470"," That's four twenty two."
"13514690","13516210"," You guys see this right here?"
"13516210","13516510"," We're seeing it. "
"13517570","13518050"," Cancel."
"13518490","13518870"," No, no."
"13519570","13519770"," Yeah. "
"13519990","13520210"," Cancel."
"13521390","13522970"," So here's your trade as a bull."
"13523610","13524510"," This is SPX. "
"13524730","13525990"," This is your end of the year trade."
"13526690","13527770"," That you should be putting on."
"13527990","13528110"," Okay. "
"13529150","13530270"," So and you've got."
"13532370","13532850"," Yeah."
"13534790","13538990"," The main concern for me is even though that's set up to do. "
"13540770","13543010"," Even though we're set up to have that trade."
"13543010","13544370"," Do you temper your expectations?"
"13544730","13547110"," Do you temper the results of those expectations?"
"13549050","13558030"," Does it get awarded in service of knowing that banks likely want to have a retest of that previous"
"13558030","13559790"," fucking low in October?"
"13560590","13562750"," When does that previous low recheck come into play?"
"13562870","13564670"," Does it come in play February?"
"13565050","13565950"," Does it come in April?"
"13566690","13567610"," Does it come in play?"
"13567950","13569350"," We already begun it right now."
"13570770","13572570"," So it's like spread out. "
"13572590","13573870"," It doesn't look so bad, but."
"13577110","13579170"," You know, yeah, it's hard."
"13579330","13583390"," So anyways, if you're going to do your holiday trade, right?"
"13583690","13588410"," And the reason why it's a spread is because you're going to see that grind all through into the end"
"13588410","13589230"," of the end of the year. "
"13591910","13592650"," So that worked."
"13592890","13593850"," Did that answer your question?"
"13594550","13595990"," Let me reset some of this shit."
"13596090","13597650"," I got to refresh this chat, man. "
"13597870","13599630"," I'm not seeing any fucking YouTube comments."
"13656020","13661120"," I just have to dig up my holiday, my holiday profile pick so they can start pissing off today"
"13661120","13661440"," Marcus."
"13676190","13676630"," Fucking love him, by the way. "
"13686240","13686680"," TLT."
"13686880","13688060"," Yeah, I want to see."
"13688600","13689900"," Yeah, like TLT. "
"13690060","13691780"," I fucking hate TLT, dude."
"13691860","13692720"," It's a bunch of fucking old guys."
"13693740","13695320"," I fucking hate that trade. "
"13696200","13696940"," Hate trading DIA."
"13697280","13697540"," Hate trading."
"13697820","13698460"," Well, I like Estau. "
"13698660","13699540"," I like triple leverage TLT."
"13700500","13701280"," Triple leverage Estau."
"13701520","13701980"," Yeah, that shit. "
"13702080","13705440"," I like that stuff, but I don't like directly trading the Dow Jones."
"13714100","13714840"," I got multi."
"13715140","13719320"," I just refresh the chat so I can hopefully see YouTube's chats again. "
"13722980","13723840"," 1229, 434."
"13724120","13725240"," You guys want to look at him?"
"13725700","13726600"," Let's look at him right now."
"13731630","13733950"," Yeah, you got to put a little bit of risk on there and they'll come. "
"13734110","13734570"," They'll get cheaper."
"13736310","13737550"," Not financial advice."
"13739070","13741970"," This is from this point forward, not financial advice. "
"13742570","13747450"," You can do it outside the money call spread and they'll fucking be dirt cheap and they'll pay a"
"13747450","13750670"," fuck ton and you don't have to hold them to expire."
"13750670","13753190"," You just need to get directionally going the way you want."
"13753330","13756610"," You can also do a credit call spread and do them outside the money. "
"13756770","13759030"," If you actually start ramping, you're going to make bank."
"13759890","13762870"," You don't have to hold them into the end of the time period and that kind of stuff."
"13763930","13766250"," It's like a December 31st or something like that. "
"13767510","13774030"," You're doing like a, you're doing like a, and I wouldn't do it like December 1st."
"13774090","13775390"," That would be like December 31st."
"13776510","13778850"," It was me December 31st outside the money. "
"13780050","13781430"," And you write them up."
"13781670","13783370"," You write them up and out whenever it happens."
"13783370","13784050"," It happens early. "
"13784530","13789450"," Every year there's a big fight about the Santa rally or the holiday rally."
"13789710","13796010"," They say every year they go like every year the holiday rally is early or it's late."
"13796370","13797670"," Sometimes it comes in January. "
"13797970","13798890"," You're going to say this since October."
"13799310","13800930"," It's coming like this first week's January."
"13801450","13805830"," So you might not get the, you could even put it for like January 15th or something. "
"13807030","13809790"," Just to buy that extra time in case it comes late this year."
"13811750","13813510"," This stream is sponsored by you."
"13813550","13814490"," You make it outside the money. "
"13814830","13816090"," You can just let them sit there."
"13816090","13817490"," Mark goes against you."
"13817730","13820310"," Probably comes back and swings high and takes it out. "
"13820770","13821950"," Take strike dot com."
"13825590","13827810"," But every year we kind of, not every year."
"13827970","13830090"," We have had a, we've had a few in my recent memory too. "
"13830250","13832510"," I think we'll have two bad ones that I can remember, but."
"13833710","13837490"," And then it becomes shit talked about for the next two months, right?"
"13837990","13839630"," You know, shit talking holiday rallies."
"13840130","13844770"," If you are in that trade too, the cool part is you can fuck around with people. "
"13845770","13846590"," On the internet."
"13849190","13853450"," Because if you're like, if you're in the trade, you're like, when's the holiday rally starting?"
"13856590","13861590"," And then you do the holiday rally shit for you like, you like, you like fucking with your friends."
"13861590","13863830"," Like, even if you don't like each other, you just fuck with each other. "
"13864670","13866890"," You know, when the fuck is the holiday rally start?"
"13867150","13869630"," And I was told there'd be a holiday rally, you know?"
"13871290","13872530"," It's like a part of the year, man."
"13872650","13873550"," It's like a part of the tradition."
"13877450","13879750"," Sparky, you know all about the holiday rally, dude. "
"13880410","13881630"," Sparky, you get involved in the."
"13881790","13883730"," So Sparky just commented, right?"
"13884550","13886650"," He fucking knows all about the holiday rally."
"13886850","13889410"," He gets all involved on, on, on fin to it with it too. "
"13889410","13892170"," I've seen you talk about the holiday rally in past years."
"13892910","13894030"," I know you, bro."
"13905630","13909490"," And that's what you, the cool part is you get to stir the shitpot on it. "
"13909930","13912950"," You know, the people who like to haul it, you're never not getting the holiday rally."
"13913270","13914550"," People will be like, I'm the Grinch this year."
"13914650","13916430"," You're not getting the holiday rally. "
"13920810","13926330"," So rocks, PM Sudanese says that foreign oil companies operating in the Kurdish region are informed"
"13926330","13932310"," that informed us that if an agreement is reached on all production costs and contracts, they will"
"13932310","13934110"," resume oil production within a month."
"13938230","13939710"," Holiday rally, bro."
"13940290","13941610"," We got the holiday rally coming. "
"13945230","13950430"," On that note too, on that note, if you are a."
"13953800","13955220"," The holiday rally, dude."
"13958320","13959360"," On that note."
"13960460","13962380"," We're coming into Halloween. "
"13964060","13968720"," If you have a, if you have a, what are you going to dress up as for Halloween?"
"13969660","13969960"," Let me know."
"13970060","13971180"," Where are you going to dress up as for Halloween?"
"13971940","13976020"," Uh, in the comment in the chat, let me know what you're going to, what you're going to."
"13979720","13981380"," Oh, you're still, you're still in the sir window. "
"13982420","13984000"," So we actually got a serious question."
"13984800","13986180"," This is another serious question."
"13987040","13990100"," So we made a, we made a, we made a video series. "
"13990860","13992860"," We posted them exclusively in the discord."
"13994000","13996920"," And we said expect a correction, right?"
"13998680","13999860"," People were like, fuck you."
"13999980","14000920"," Did nobody watch it. "
"14001000","14002140"," Like 70 people watched it."
"14002680","14004760"," Like a week later, it was like 1500 views."
"14008560","14010180"," So now that we're down here. "
"14010380","14011780"," So when we're up there, everybody's bullish."
"14012200","14012900"," We're down here."
"14013700","14014580"," Everybody's bearish. "
"14015720","14017140"," Everybody is bearish."
"14018160","14020680"," Right now I'd realize that 430 looked like it would be the bottom."
"14020800","14022320"," We have an extension of the downside of 420. "
"14023320","14024900"," But let me ask you a serious question."
"14024900","14026540"," Are you bearish here?"
"14026820","14030020"," This is the, this is the same pep talk as to expect a correction."
"14032080","14036120"," Uh, your bearishness is making me bullish as fuck. "
"14036680","14043940"," So, um, that's that, it's that same fucking video."
"14044260","14045100"," It's having right now."
"14045580","14046440"," Start getting bullish. "
"14047240","14049200"," Um, expect a turnaround."
"14051060","14053880"," Even if you, even if you got a day or two or three days."
"14054460","14055400"," You're like, Oh, cap. "
"14055560","14057080"," It's going down 60, 70 points."
"14057440","14059580"," You're going to look back in two, three months and say, Oh, shit."
"14060000","14061640"," It's running up to the upside down. "
"14061980","14062380"," So."
"14069740","14075500"," We got him saying, think about that, right?"
"14077280","14078560"," Try to, try to think about that."
"14079720","14082600"," Do you guys want a series of videos or make like three videos?"
"14083400","14083640"," I will. "
"14083820","14084400"," I'll put them to the discord."
"14084660","14085000"," How about that?"
"14088880","14092560"," No, I am always the opposite 100% opposite."
"14093120","14095600"," So, um, no. "
"14099280","14099720"," Yeah."
"14100000","14103100"," No, no, the history's on the, history's on the side of that holiday rally happening."
"14103480","14106600"," Generally speaking, the forces against you and that not happening. "
"14107400","14109500"," Now, the timing is usually fucked up."
"14109560","14111840"," It's usually not when you want it to happen or when you think it's going to happen."
"14113880","14114860"," Oh, I got your brother. "
"14115520","14116260"," I got you Turkey."
"14117040","14117340"," Shit."
"14117420","14118100"," It's in your name, bro. "
"14123580","14123940"," Yeah."
"14124160","14124600"," What do you guys were?"
"14124780","14129140"," What are you guys going to do for holiday present or for not holiday for how if you, if you"
"14129140","14131900"," celebrate Halloween, what are you dressing up as this year?"
"14132620","14134180"," No, I got some mixed feelings on this."
"14135000","14138280"," Um, I watched a video about. "
"14140720","14148060"," Halloween costumes for this year and this guy went and bought every costume in a store."
"14148680","14154800"," And they said, we're not buying costumes this year."
"14156000","14160820"," For solidarity with striking actors and writers in Hollywood. "
"14162600","14172120"," And I was like, I was like, initially, I was like, I was like, that makes sense."
"14172840","14173560"," I can do that."
"14173840","14178920"," So they were like, if you're going to get a costume, get like a doctor or a nurse or something"
"14178920","14181800"," that's not like a Marvel superhero, okay?"
"14182020","14183680"," Like don't be a Marvel superhero superhero. "
"14184200","14186900"," My initial reaction was I like that."
"14189420","14191180"," And then what I thought about was kids."
"14192000","14195360"," I was like, I don't know what my feeling is on this. "
"14195360","14200260"," I don't, I don't know what my thought process here is because I understand doing it."
"14200360","14204200"," So like, I think if I was going to an adult party, yeah, that's fine."
"14204540","14208900"," But then I was thinking about like kids, like my kid said to me, Oh, Daddy, I want you to"
"14208900","14213060"," be, um, Frozone, right?"
"14213380","14214200"," I'd be like, fuck yeah, man. "
"14214300","14215200"," I'll be frozen for you."
"14215960","14217640"," Uh, Daddy, I want you to be Snow White."
"14217980","14219060"," I dress up as Snow White. "
"14219520","14222900"," Um, so I have a mixed feeling on that whole thing."
"14222900","14227540"," Some kids don't understand or know anything about a strike in Hollywood."
"14228560","14230980"," Um, especially young kids, they like to see that shit. "
"14231200","14232660"," Kids like, they'd like, know that shit."
"14232780","14233360"," They want to see it."
"14233560","14238400"," Now on the other hand, on the other hand of that argument, that kid doesn't even know what's going"
"14238400","14238640"," on. "
"14238780","14243020"," So if I didn't dress up as that character, they wouldn't know any better anyways."
"14243800","14249420"," And it would be a nice refresher and breather not to be trying to be someone from Hollywood or"
"14249420","14258000"," someone from your favorite actor or your favorite part or anime or cartoon person."
"14258340","14260840"," So I will ask you that question. "
"14260960","14262600"," Are you going to do that or not do that?"
"14263400","14264140"," Uh, do you not care?"
"14264300","14265040"," Do you think it's stupid?"
"14265260","14268660"," Do you think, um, like whatever your thoughts are, let me know."
"14269320","14275480"," So for me from a Halloween, uh, for this year for Halloween, uh, I was, I have a bunch of"
"14275480","14279020"," like, I've got a, I got to get some overcoat and stuff and I was going to be a vampire"
"14279020","14280800"," or something for Halloween."
"14281100","14281780"," My kids are a little bit older. "
"14281920","14283520"," I didn't want to be too scary for younger kids."
"14284300","14288680"," Um, we're going to have like a bonfire and big, we have a big neighborhood trick-or-treat and all"
"14288680","14294980"," that kind of stuff and set up a small, uh, small, like, uh, maze for kids to trick-or-treat"
"14294980","14295620"," and all that kind of stuff."
"14295800","14297760"," But what are you guys going to wear for Halloween this, uh, this Halloween?"
"14297940","14301740"," If you do, if you do practice that are good parties or dress up or have kids or whatever like"
"14301740","14301900"," that. "
"14305240","14305700"," That's real."
"14305700","14308820"," Like that's real, people are asking that for you not to do that right now."
"14309500","14313440"," Uh, I, I get it and I get why you can do it with kids to an extent. "
"14313700","14317020"," But like if your kid said to you, hey, so the only thing I would say to you is, you"
"14317020","14320280"," know, if you see somebody dressed like that, like dressed Hollywood and you're going to go after"
"14320280","14321920"," them, just be careful."
"14322160","14326540"," The fucking kid might have said to him, hey, can you dress up as this or dress up as that?"
"14327460","14330500"," You know, don't, um, you don't, you don't know their situation."
"14330700","14334400"," You know, you're not gonna, if my kid says to me, I want you to be a lad and then"
"14334400","14338840"," I tell my kids, no, because of the Hollywood writer's strike in action. "
"14339740","14342480"," My kids going to look at me like, what the fuck are you talking about, right?"
"14342600","14344740"," If my kids like a six year old, they're going to get that."
"14347880","14348660"," You know what I'm saying?"
"14349340","14351880"," Yeah, if I was an adult party, I'd probably follow that protocol."
"14352340","14354340"," Personally, I would have been like, yeah, I'll do that for that. "
"14354480","14356100"," But, um, ooh, do that."
"14356320","14357760"," Look at those big old red bars up there."
"14357880","14358640"," What are they doing up there?"
"14358740","14359120"," Look at these guys. "
"14359380","14360980"," Oh, what's going on up there?"
"14361060","14362200"," They got more supply to drive."
"14362520","14363580"," Look at that supply up there."
"14363580","14364040"," Ooh. "
"14365920","14367700"," You shall not pass up here."
"14368280","14369640"," That's that pin at the end of the day."
"14370360","14371580"," I want you to see that right there. "
"14371680","14372920"," You see that end of the day pin up here."
"14373740","14375420"," We're gonna talk about that right now."
"14376380","14377660"," We're gonna talk about this week. "
"14377840","14381140"," And this, this is the walk of the plank that's being set up right now up here."
"14383810","14386970"," Oh, dude, trading 62 right now on Friday."
"14388450","14390210"," Ooh, up 40%. "
"14390210","14391110"," Something like that."
"14392650","14393550"," Oh, yeah."
"14397090","14398130"," Oh, yes. "
"14398390","14399570"," Smashing, bashing, baby."
"14400990","14403470"," Oh, we got the bow cluster going on again."
"14404170","14405250"," Make some money. "
"14410660","14411980"," That's Catalina holiday mixer."
"14412400","14413160"," I like that."
"14413900","14415480"," I have a play on that. "
"14415620","14416160"," It's called the."
"14417760","14420780"," It's not the Catalina mixer, but there's another mixer that I like."
"14421220","14423620"," There's like a play on it that I like for an idea of. "
"14423620","14425260"," I'll try to think about the."
"14425480","14428260"," I'll say it's not the Catalina wine mixer."
"14428260","14429280"," There's another wine mixer. "
"14430880","14434040"," I'll try to remember it, but I like the Catalina wine mixer."
"14434060","14434740"," I like that."
"14434920","14435460"," Dig it. "
"14436740","14440140"," Dressing up as a mom, taking throwing her kids a Halloween party."
"14441000","14442040"," A rapper's run DMC."
"14442480","14442820"," Nice. "
"14442900","14443700"," I like I like them."
"14443820","14444520"," I like the dog doing."
"14444860","14447500"," So Stacy saying run rappers run DMC. "
"14447500","14448340"," My dog too."
"14450220","14451240"," That's a luxury belief."
"14451240","14451640"," So rich. "
"14451920","14453060"," You can go down by the costumes."
"14453900","14458480"," Writers getting commissions from costumes before."
"14458760","14460420"," I think it's something to be like said to. "
"14461020","14464320"," I think the idea here would be if you want to know the idea behind it."
"14464540","14465740"," I had thought about that too."
"14465820","14472900"," I think the idea behind it is I don't trigger you to watch a movie or a TV show and"
"14472900","14474700"," consume that content while they're striking. "
"14475140","14476440"," Whether you agree with that, I disagree with it."
"14476940","14480140"," I don't know, but you know, I don't care."
"14480140","14483180"," But I think that's why they're saying don't wear those costumes. "
"14487000","14488400"," Don't pay it to the kids expense."
"14489760","14492640"," Let me see."
"14492780","14494080"," Go to Vegas for Halloween. "
"14494380","14495280"," Oh, you go to the spirit."
"14495540","14496760"," Spare is gangster Stacy."
"14497940","14498680"," Spare Stacy. "
"14499720","14502120"," I would be rolling face at the sphere."
"14502560","14503380"," No, I would."
"14503560","14507080"," I'd be like, if you have mushrooms and Molly all night long going to that thing. "
"14510400","14513880"," Vegas was expensive right now or was last weekend."
"14513880","14516340"," It was bank was not cheap at all."
"14520780","14521960"," Oh, dude, a bear. "
"14522140","14523700"," Dude, hold on a second here."
"14527480","14530100"," The ROI and costume costume Kenny revs."
"14531460","14533200"," Dude, I got a beer costume here. "
"14533900","14535020"," I should put that on for Halloween."
"14536760","14538360"," A big loving caring bear."
"14538560","14540260"," Hell yeah, I've got a beer costume here. "
"14540260","14541900"," I've got a bear sitting right back there."
"14541900","14543300"," You got him back there and watching over me."
"14549120","14550380"," Dude, break out Bob. "
"14550660","14551220"," What are you saying?"
"14552940","14554660"," You're terrible break out Bob."
"14559470","14563050"," Okay, so what do we do here?"
"14563310","14565550"," Do we close the Friday calls?"
"14567570","14573530"," Up on those big red bars up there and then leave the zero dates on for the fun times."
"14573530","14576410"," I don't want to get trapped in the fun times after the after hours. "
"14576550","14576790"," Do I?"
"14577270","14578930"," Let's talk about that right now."
"14580130","14581530"," We're going to talk about that right now."
"14582150","14583210"," You guys are terrible. "
"14583310","14583750"," You guys are mean."
"14588330","14589610"," Hold on a second here."
"14592050","14592450"," Terrible. "
"14594490","14595890"," All right, let's talk about."
"14597190","14598990"," Let's talk about talk about hold on here."
"14607960","14610740"," Yeah, I don't have the full soup, but I could get one. "
"14610740","14613860"," I could order one and have it here probably by Halloween."
"14618500","14619420"," DTM, what up?"
"14627620","14629060"," What's going on brother?"
"14630440","14631560"," The rinse and repeat."
"14631560","14631840"," The rinse and repeat. "
"14640040","14646820"," Trading 67 on 44 right now and Friday calls the zero dates on the on the move right now too."
"14648480","14649320"," Oh boy."
"14649400","14649560"," Okay. "
"14649680","14650940"," So we're going to get an a weebel right now."
"14653960","14655000"," All right."
"14656160","14656940"," Let's talk. "
"14657140","14657960"," Let's talk turkey."
"14658260","14658920"," Let's talk Halloween."
"14661160","14664060"," We got some stuff to do here. "
"14665480","14667000"," Oh boy."
"14668700","14669620"," Okay."
"14672970","14674930"," Today is Tuesday. "
"14676010","14676730"," We got Wednesday."
"14677390","14678150"," We got Thursday."
"14678650","14679750"," We got Friday here. "
"14683290","14684950"," Gather around gang."
"14688860","14691740"," What can we tell right here?"
"14691740","14691880"," Okay."
"14692620","14694460"," What can we decipher right here?"
"14696140","14697280"," What can we decipher?"
"14697960","14704720"," No, it makes natural gas November futures settle out $2.97. Let's go to November futures at $3.05 a"
"14704720","14704940"," gallon. "
"14705320","14706460"," First, let's go to the trigger screen."
"14714530","14716050"," Follow along, okay."
"14721100","14721820"," Price below. "
"14723120","14724340"," The green, right?"
"14724780","14725860"," Price below, price below."
"14727360","14731000"," Price below, trying to recover right now, right?"
"14731000","14733980"," No guarantees though yet, right?"
"14735100","14736940"," Bull's not out of the woods yet, right?"
"14737240","14739560"," All this looming sellers above right here."
"14740080","14741900"," So bull's still not out of the way, right?"
"14742060","14743300"," Bull's still not out of pain yet. "
"14744380","14747880"," Bull's still not in safety yet, right?"
"14748400","14750900"," Bull's need to be above the daily trigger."
"14751880","14754020"," We need the hourly, right?"
"14754320","14756020"," To get out of all that craziness, right?"
"14756180","14756600"," That's 432."
"14757080","14759200"," That's also positive gamma, right?"
"14759980","14761680"," So bull's not out of the woods yet. "
"14763720","14765320"," We got the wee bull chart over here."
"14765600","14767240"," This is your green bar right here, okay?"
"14768320","14769600"," See your green bar right here."
"14769680","14770740"," We're above it right now. "
"14773800","14781380"," This is a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, right?"
"14790760","14792120"," There's your weekly right there."
"14796220","14798580"," This is your daily right here."
"14802100","14805380"," So bull's need to be above. "
"14807280","14808140"," Oh, dude."
"14808900","14810760"," It's 74 right now in Spa."
"14811900","14816220"," Hold on, I got to check my straight here, because we got to talk about weeklies here. "
"14817540","14821070"," I'm going to talk about weeklies."
"14821330","14821590"," Oh, yeah."
"14821970","14822870"," Fuck, yeah, squeeze it. "
"14822870","14823910"," Back and right."
"14823990","14824810"," Squeeze that up there."
"14826430","14827170"," Hell's yes. "
"14833950","14834630"," Squeeze, baby."
"14836590","14837730"," That's your first target."
"14837930","14839450"," You're coming to your first target right now. "
"14840310","14841210"," It's that R1."
"14843490","14845470"," So bull's aren't out of it yet, right?"
"14847750","14849430"," You're going to walk the plank in here."
"14850050","14851770"," All my curse in the bottom left-hand side of your screen. "
"14852750","14854550"," So you're going to park this bad boy, right?"
"14854550","14859170"," And you're going to get some big reports, and you could have some major down moves or up moves"
"14859170","14859710"," here, right?"
"14861310","14865590"," So you don't want to get stuck with weeklies, because it's a nice push-up, right?"
"14866330","14870270"," If it reverses to the downside, it's not going to be good for you, is it?"
"14873490","14875650"," So bull's not out of the woods yet here."
"14876350","14884870"," You could be more confident if price, and the price gets above the hourly trigger."
"14885150","14889650"," And the hourly trigger comes up, right?"
"14891810","14893370"," That's awesome sauce, right?"
"14893470","14894270"," You get a bounce over here?"
"14894370","14900910"," We do it for corporate earnings with giants, Microsoft and Google's parent meta alphabet, sorry,"
"14901110","14902510"," reporting their numbers after the close. "
"14902630","14903450"," That's awesome, right?"
"14904050","14905470"," But we're not there right now, are we?"
"14905690","14907810"," We're not in that mode yet, are we?"
"14908230","14914930"," We are in the mode of set them up, the pins, and we're going to roll a bowling ball into"
"14914930","14915210"," it."
"14915650","14920510"," We're likely going to go into this close here, and we're going to make some decisions, right?"
"14920970","14923930"," Bad reports, market go down, market bad."
"14924890","14925790"," Your weekly is burned. "
"14927310","14928790"," Good report, go to the moon, right?"
"14929810","14935770"," So the concept here would be, if you're in those weekly calls, you take the money and run, right,"
"14935770","14940550"," take your money and run, set up some zero dates, much less pain, right?"
"14941070","14947350"," Cost 10 cents, cost 15 cents, whatever it costs, no pain to you, right?"
"14947470","14950830"," If we get a great report, whoo, squeeze up, what normally happens on a good report?"
"14951150","14955810"," Next day we come back down on the index, and you can jump back in a weekly again, right?"
"14956690","14957130"," Makes sense?"
"14958310","14960330"," So be careful of that here."
"14961030","14962490"," Go back down to 70 cents."
"14962670","14963810"," Fuck, I should have taken the money. "
"14967500","14968940"," I'm going to stay in them right now."
"14969520","14970580"," I'm going to go against my own advice."
"14971480","14977100"," But what I do want to say to you here is, they're going to line these up this week on"
"14977100","14978500"," the index level, at least. "
"14980100","14985840"," Sometimes the index will keep going higher, but oftentimes, right, you come in here, you'll get"
"14985840","14990800"," some weakness in the index as it'll bounce around, go up here, go down there, and then by morning,"
"14990800","14991900"," where do you open?"
"14992260","14993520"," Right over here, right?"
"14994000","14995520"," You don't actually open up over here."
"14995680","15000400"," So trading off of session highs led by losses in energy shares, as oil slides below 84."
"15000840","15001060"," So beak. "
"15001680","15005600"," So once again, the gauge a found support above the key 4,200 mark."
"15006160","15008480"," So Verizon, 3M and general electric."
"15008820","15009200"," Thanks, David. "
"15009420","15014700"," On bullish forecasts, metal platforms dropped off of being sued by California and a group of states"
"15014700","15016900"," over harmful youth marketing claims."
"15016900","15017620"," Yeah."
"15017640","15023120"," Bitcoin as well in the crypto space briefly topped $35,000 in fixed income. "
"15023120","15024500"," Treasure return, your yields edge."
"15024640","15025380"," It's not done going up."
"15025540","15027720"," It's going to 38 following a Monday's intense volatility. "
"15027940","15029380"," It's going up 38,000."
"15031140","15032720"," So inside of here, right?"
"15033860","15038440"," You know, if you want to trade, you want to synthetically trade, you can do this on queues or not"
"15038440","15038680"," queues."
"15039980","15042300"," Yeah, you can do, you can do queues until 4, 15. "
"15042980","15044880"," You can do spy until 4, 15."
"15044880","15051420"," It is selling at $88.07 a barrel, which is down $1.76 or 1.96% on the session."
"15051740","15052520"," Turn this shit off. "
"15054320","15060780"," If you don't want to put the risk on Microsoft or Google, and you don't like, let's say you put"
"15060780","15064520"," a call on a Microsoft and Google, you can't get out of it after 4 p.m., right?"
"15064660","15066780"," So if you do a synthetic trade, you can trade queues."
"15067520","15073760"," And if you get that big ass rip, you can exit the trade, take the money to Ching and run."
"15073760","15080440"," Also, another benefit here is, let's say, Google and Microsoft initially after the close or any"
"15080440","15085480"," report after the close sends the market to the depths of hell initially, but then the reports turn"
"15085480","15087440"," out to be good or the report later in the day. "
"15087980","15095900"," You buy the calls or the puts or whatever your thesis is at like 410 for the following day, one"
"15095900","15098520"," date calls, and then you actually get the rip afterwards."
"15098760","15099220"," Make sense?"
"15099900","15105280"," Or if you get the report at 4 p.m., you get the initial downside move, you grab it, report"
"15105280","15108580"," comes in great, you run it up until 4.13 in the afternoon, you're out."
"15108960","15109580"," See you later. "
"15110120","15115080"," And even if Microsoft or whatever comes back and we bottom the next day, you're not locked into"
"15115080","15119560"," those calls and the dealers aren't fucking you for gambling on that trade."
"15120700","15125680"," So it's synthetically trading earnings through the after hours mark after hours here."
"15126580","15131160"," Very viable, usually very profitable if you capture it the right way, and especially if you get"
"15131160","15131640"," them really cheap. "
"15131840","15136320"," You can usually get calls for like 10 cents, 5 cents, 20 cents, something like that, run them up to"
"15136320","15142560"," 30 cents, 60 cents, 70 cents in a matter of moments, exit, and then let them do whatever they want"
"15142560","15143040"," to do thereafter."
"15144180","15145640"," So there is that opportunity here."
"15146000","15147560"," This whole week here is setting up for that. "
"15147720","15149620"," So this is the playground right here."
"15150180","15153400"," This is the playground for the rest of the week to fuck around."
"15153400","15154480"," In the after hours. "
"15155180","15160180"," And for you as a bull, you're not quite out of the woods yet until you get above this weekly"
"15160180","15161080"," and daily trigger."
"15161880","15163680"," And this hourly trigger as well."
"15163820","15165240"," You need this hourly trigger to push up. "
"15166140","15170560"," Squeeze up here and start getting price above all of this crap back here."
"15170660","15173760"," So until that happens, not quite bullish yet."
"15174140","15175760"," There is a turn happening though. "
"15175800","15177880"," Let's look on the one hour chart here."
"15179320","15181620"," Are we on the on the change right now?"
"15181760","15182780"," No, but we are there."
"15182780","15183860"," Look at this hourly trend. "
"15185300","15186740"," Just starting to happen."
"15186740","15187500"," See this right here?"
"15188280","15189800"," You see that white line?"
"15190520","15191780"," See that red line?"
"15192640","15195280"," This is that hourly trend to the upside."
"15196360","15196720"," Is it there?"
"15197080","15197080"," Yes. "
"15197360","15198500"," Can it be a trap for bulls?"
"15198760","15198980"," Yes."
"15199380","15204280"," You get some bad reports and it's a big reversal to the downside and more continued blood to the"
"15204280","15204480"," downside."
"15204880","15216540"," So even if we go up here, you're still going to expect price to come back down and"
"15216540","15219780"," recheck that hourly trend change to the upside. "
"15220580","15222400"," If you want to know what I think, fuck."
"15222600","15223060"," Yeah, baby."
"15223780","15225160"," You're going to buy that right there. "
"15227360","15229360"," Then you're going to come back and buy this again."
"15229580","15234460"," There's the opportunity for the week, the second entry in two weeklies."
"15234700","15234920"," See it?"
"15234980","15235460"," You got weeklies?"
"15236220","15236940"," Take the money and run. "
"15236940","15242920"," Jump back in weeklies again to the upside right here tomorrow or the following day."
"15243280","15246600"," Trade zero dates inside of this zone right here."
"15248340","15250060"," Don't be tied to that position. "
"15250720","15251780"," See the reversal coming?"
"15252280","15254420"," One hour trend reversal starting right now."
"15259270","15260110"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"15260370","15261950"," Look at that shit right there. "
"15267030","15268770"," They're going to park this shit in the clothes."
"15274910","15284700"," I'm going to park this right into the clothes."
"15285140","15285360"," I think. "
"15378780","15381500"," Dude, my, uh, my chat is all fucked up."
"15382200","15383460"," Oh, fucked up."
"15383460","15388520"," I don't know what is going on with that. "
"15416820","15425550"," We can double tap this up here."
"15429580","15432040"," Slide that R1 over so you can see it right there."
"15438060","15438740"," What's going on?"
"15438820","15439280"," Break up Bob. "
"15440620","15441780"," It's a nice name, by the way."
"15444840","15446380"," Oh, Bob in the basement would be great."
"15447040","15449880"," It's dressed up like a 1970s suit or something like that. "
"15450120","15455100"," Like dirty tan suit with some dirty old, like, kind of like a salvation army and then put like a"
"15455100","15457380"," pocket protector and some glasses on with some white tape."
"15460240","15462360"," Dude, basement Bob would be fucking awesome."
"15462980","15464160"," I might have to do basement Bob. "
"15472540","15475500"," I might have to do basement Bob."
"15476100","15476940"," I'm going to have to go."
"15477100","15478580"," I'm going to go after this show today. "
"15479360","15481800"," I'm going to go to a secondhand store and pick up that costume."
"15483700","15484140"," Definitely."
"15484740","15485180"," Yes. "
"15485360","15486100"," Synthetic trade and baby."
"15492670","15494370"," A bunch of 430 C's."
"15494470","15497750"," I got 430 C's expiring today for expiring on Friday. "
"15498390","15500330"," I bought that bottom this afternoon for Friday."
"15502570","15504330"," The bottom of 44 cents."
"15512940","15515980"," You see what I'm missing a bunch of this fucking stream. "
"15521570","15522530"," I gave up."
"15522690","15524870"," I gave up trying to make so much sense."
"15525050","15526290"," This market is so detached from everything. "
"15526430","15528610"," My theory is every thing is bearish."
"15528730","15530270"," Take the dirt cheap out of the tree from wrong."
"15530490","15534790"," No big e managers on vacation this week going to go get verbally abused by Karens. "
"15534850","15535510"," They're good at work."
"15535670","15536030"," Jesus."
"15537350","15538110"," Good luck guys. "
"15538210","15538610"," Good luck to you."
"15538710","15539290"," TTM as well."
"15550750","15553310"," So today we're going to talk about some of the reports coming out. "
"15554490","15556450"," I'm going to pull up some of these reports right now."
"15557070","15558830"," I thought I had them open but I don't see them."
"15560950","15563210"," Why is this not open here right now for me?"
"15572030","15574130"," So there are your reports for the end of the day today. "
"15574950","15577450"," I'm going to post some of what I'm going to do from."
"15577630","15579090"," So it's 245 in the afternoon."
"15579090","15579390"," Okay. "
"15580630","15584990"," Until the end of the day, I'm going to put up six screeners for you."
"15585710","15588810"," And we're going to watch six reports after the bell."
"15589630","15598390"," So today we've got Microsoft Google Visa, Waste Management, Texas Instruments, Snap and Chub. "
"15598930","15603430"," So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven major reports."
"15604350","15606670"," I'm going to do all of them except for Chub."
"15606850","15613750"," So you're going to see us put up charts for Microsoft Google Visa, Waste Management, Snap. "
"15614930","15617930"," And you guys want Texas Instruments or Chub."
"15618450","15620230"," And I'll do a poll with you guys."
"15621070","15622530"," If we have time, I'll do a poll. "
"15624670","15628790"," And we will take a poll to see up or down any of these tickers."
"15628810","15631950"," I will show you the expected moves for these tickers."
"15638970","15639550"," All right. "
"15639570","15641310"," I'm flat on weeklies on spoos."
"15644460","15646620"," And now I've got just zero dates."
"15647480","15649540"," I'm probably going to add some more after the bell. "
"15650320","15651700"," And we're going to look at those."
"15651880","15654620"," We're going to watch those reports in the show today."
"15655120","15658540"," I'll stick by with you guys after 4pm to see what those reports are. "
"15659180","15661140"," I'm going to show you what the expected move is."
"15661700","15667160"," And I do want to let you know that if you are holding through these reports or trying to trade"
"15667160","15668920"," these reports, I never recommend it."
"15669220","15674960"," If you are going to do it, try to take a farther farther down the road strike, try to do"
"15674960","15681660"," spreads, try to do strangles, straddles, try to sell fucking calls and puts. "
"15681760","15687300"," If you know what I'm talking about a lot, not always, but but a lot of the times, man, dealers"
"15687300","15688620"," don't give a fuck."
"15688900","15692240"," They just want unless there's some unexpected news."
"15693440","15695260"," They're just going to want to take all of your money. "
"15695860","15697720"," They're there for that reason."
"15698180","15700220"," So, you know, sit by and watch."
"15700740","15705000"," My favorite way, though, if you're trying to capture that trade is synthetically through the"
"15705000","15705720"," index's cues. "
"15706680","15707660"," Spoons don't care."
"15707880","15710160"," So we're going to look at both of those right now."
"15710180","15711540"," I'm going to set those up in the background. "
"15713180","15716120"," Tomorrow in the morning on Wednesday, we've got reporting Boeing."
"15717300","15723500"," T-Mobile, thermal fissure, dental dynamics, Hilton, ADP, Penske, Ryder, looking at you, DIA."
"15723960","15726920"," Maybe you pick up a trade for DIA tomorrow. "
"15728140","15731140"," You pick up a triple leveraged upside or downside move."
"15731900","15734780"," For those reports in the morning, then we get the big boys coming."
"15735220","15736180"," Meta IBM. "
"15736980","15738060"," Then we've got a bunch more."
"15738280","15739660"," I like a Riley, by the way."
"15740640","15743260"," Baker Hughes, UHF, that's the close on Wednesday. "
"15743560","15746660"," We've got a bunch of economic news coming out heading into Thursday."
"15747640","15751800"," Now, we could see some experience and volatility in between Wednesday and Thursday."
"15751940","15758860"," I'm very bullish on Microsoft, Meta, Waste Management, and Snap. "
"15759240","15765760"," Even though Snap gets, even if Snap doesn't do well in the earnings, I'm bullish on it overall."
"15767300","15770020"," So, it might not, like Snap might not happen for a couple of weeks."
"15770180","15771780"," It looks like they got some of that trade out of the way already. "
"15772400","15776100"," Then we have the big boys coming up, UPS, Amazon, later in the week."
"15776760","15779620"," And then it kind of acquires, it quiets down into the weekend."
"15780880","15782620"," We have Chipotle as well, MasterCard. "
"15782720","15783500"," I guess those are all big ones."
"15783640","15785140"," A bunch of airlines and stuff like that."
"15785820","15789000"," So, I'm going to set this up in the background right now as you guys do your thing. "
"15792160","15796520"," And let me get to do this work till the four PM hour here, so I can go through, get"
"15796520","15797560"," ready for you guys."
"15799720","15801300"," Thank you, Dylan, for chiming in on that."
"15801300","15806860"," Dylan just said, earning short sellers take advantage of all spikes driving premiums up, sell"
"15806860","15810280"," short, then IV crush after you put out, regardless of direction. "
"15810720","15812540"," Tell them, Dylan, tell them, man."
"15813260","15814480"," Tell them, tell them, tell them."
"15817020","15820520"," Let me read this to you if you're on Twitter or Twitch right now. "
"15822880","15827100"," Dylan, Raythel is like nail on the head."
"15827760","15830560"," Earnings short sellers take advantage of all spikes."
"15830560","15834120"," So, this is like driving up IV2, right?"
"15834460","15837120"," You have IV and interest in all of these positions. "
"15837880","15838960"," The IV kicks off."
"15839800","15841400"," As soon as everything is over, right?"
"15841560","15842320"," The IV is gone."
"15842520","15844540"," The interest is not as many people trading it anymore. "
"15845160","15846540"," And you get big time ball crush."
"15846800","15848460"," Even if you are right, you're wrong."
"15849340","15851660"," Seriously, you got to absolutely right. "
"15851880","15856080"," Earning short sellers take advantage of all spikes driving premiums up, sell short, then IV crush"
"15856080","15857840"," after report out, regardless of direction."
"15860680","15864240"," Oh, yeah, that is Stacey F saying cap."
"15864460","15869320"," So happy you're on today looking at our TX or three minute exercise break 15 minutes. "
"15870880","15871820"," Hold on one second here."
"15871820","15872220"," I'm going to do."
"15872500","15873760"," Oh, yeah, I got to do an exercise break. "
"15873780","15874100"," Don't I?"
"15874920","15875940"," I didn't take one today."
"15876120","15876300"," All right."
"15876360","15877200"," I'm going to take a 10 minute break. "
"15878480","15882840"," I'm going to do some exercising and I'll break back with you at three o'clock."
"15882940","15884700"," And I'm going to set up these charts for you."
"15885380","15886720"," We'll roll over into that. "
"15887360","15892620"," We'll roll over into that set up for the close here."
"15893680","15897420"," If you're at home, open up the options chain for cues or spy."
"15898400","15904560"," If you want to synthetically trade this shit with me and start looking, start paying attention to"
"15904560","15911460"," the IV or interest on each put on each option that you're interested in. "
"15912000","15915080"," And we'll start looking at those things as we come into the four o'clock hour."
"15918710","15920250"," I got to go potty really bad too."
"15920330","15920870"," I got to take them. "
"15922770","15923410"," Hold on here."
"15923490","15924130"," What are we going to do here?"
"15956140","15956960"," Hold on here."
"15961990","15963430"," Leave that up for you guys. "
"15964430","15965650"," Well, I take that break."
"16051760","16052600"," All right."
"16063240","16067500"," Your wife accidentally just cast my stream on to the neighbors and CV instead"
"16067500","16074440"," of ours. "
"16074440","16075540"," Do that."
"16434720","16436560"," That took that took like 10."
"16436840","16437560"," Do those like fast. "
"16438740","16440340"," Get that heart rate up."
"16442020","16443080"," All right."
"16452730","16454490"," Like the power bicycle. "
"16455250","16456650"," The low is like it here."
"16459849","16461410"," All right."
"16463860","16466990"," You see her be right back. "
"16470310","16472070"," Bring that over there."
"16477900","16479410"," That right there."
"16480540","16481759"," That felt good. "
"16482380","16483439"," That felt really good."
"16495480","16497560"," Dude, that felt fucking good."
"16497779","16500099"," Like I got an exercise bike. "
"16502040","16503599"," All right."
"16506330","16507509"," Oh, you know what else we're going to do?"
"16507849","16508450"," How about this?"
"16508650","16509830"," We're going to open up the chat."
"16511930","16516130"," So if you're just joining us, if you're just showing up right now. "

"16628740","16630599"," So we did a second on VC yesterday."
"16630800","16633740"," It's in distribution right now, even though price is high."
"16634259","16636419"," It is even though price is high. "

"16637900","16638619"," Be aware of that."
"16638820","16640640"," Visa is in distribution right now. "
"16641900","16642300"," Okay."

"16659820","16661259"," I'm hoping I can get the fuck on out of Visa. "
"16661460","16664140"," As a matter of fact, I should probably sell before even getting to the earnings today."
"16664279","16667480"," But let me say I got to set something up here for you guys as we come into this close."
"16668160","16672860"," I'm going to set up the trade for you guys right now so I can bring this to a full"
"16672860","16673119"," screen. "

"18194400","18200660"," I want to own Visa like in February or April of next year and not right now."
"18200660","18207300"," So Visa upside target from me even though the expected move is not that is two. "
"18208160","18211720"," Thirty six if you see great news on Visa."
"18212340","18220280"," You're going to expect an explosive move to the upside and you will likely trade this 240 at least"
"18220280","18221560"," maybe even 250."
"18222400","18229960"," Into tomorrow if we get bad news on Visa be very careful on a higher time frame Visa is so"
"18229960","18235300"," is being I'm going to show this to you right now on Visa right now okay on a daily basis. "

"18254120","18255100"," like this down here."
"18255580","18259260"," It means to expect a violent move down. "
"18259480","18264140"," I don't know what that news is going to be but there is going to be news at some point"
"18264140","18266500"," expect if not in this earnings report."

"18276080","18278380"," if it's in this earnings report even if price goes higher."
"18279280","18281740"," I am very wary being a Visa holder right now. "
"18281960","18283900"," It's a big concern for me."
"18284620","18289640"," And whenever you're seeing this like price just grind higher like this it's just begging to come"
"18289640","18290300"," down to reality."
"18290760","18292200"," So Visa not a fan of it. "
"18292700","18294820"," Next we're going to look at here is Google."
"18303490","18308150"," Doing it same thing right CNBC telling you it's looking for a big huge move up on Google."
"18308690","18313030"," Trying to blast up have that final breakout get going and right above right. "
"18313350","18314990"," It's upside target on Google."

"18318570","18322730"," They need to get above one fifty one sixty would be wonderful. "
"18323490","18330710"," Now if Google does not fucking produce right you are going to see a hundred and twelve dollars."
"18330710","18335890"," It's absolutely and likely even come down to eighty seven."
"18336390","18342330"," So Google on the plank do or die for them to come up here and get that cup and handle"
"18342330","18345950"," going come up here and start start smashing and bashing right. "
"18347230","18355110"," Google I have CNBC is pumping them up today but I'm not as much of a fan as you might"
"18355110","18355330"," be."
"18355330","18359930"," I think I think Google is going to be a squeeze like a squeeze up and then take the money"
"18359930","18360290"," and run."
"18361030","18364170"," So I don't see it being sustained if they have a good report. "

"18387810","18389330"," this upcoming expiry."
"18389790","18395110"," I would like to see the I would see this the second expiry like a blast up and then come"
"18395110","18398270"," back down but but I'm really scared of like a battery port. "
"18398550","18404990"," I'll bounce to nail those those puts and then you have the continuation of the secondary to get"
"18404990","18408250"," some really cheap calls and then do a lot of calls a second time."
"18408250","18414450"," If it fails to get that actual move in snap bullish on snap."
"18414570","18418530"," That's my second favorite ticker and it's the one if you like in lottery lottery calls. "
"18418650","18420610"," It's the one that I love to trade right now."
"18421670","18426830"," Next we've got waste management that one up."
"18427490","18430250"," There it is. "
"18430970","18436390"," Waste management just bouncing down selling down right just slam slam slam slam slam slam."
"18436450","18440650"," They usually have a bad fall reports."
"18440790","18444810"," So waste management I am fascinated in this ticker. "
"18444870","18450810"," I would like to see I would like to see waste management just blast down."
"18451010","18455530"," I'm bearish on waste management but you know it just keeps grinding higher and higher and higher to"
"18455530","18457250"," consolidation over here."
"18457250","18463490"," They just keep buying it watch this buy it buy it buy it buy it right there right the expectation"
"18463490","18465250"," being we're going to rip faces off. "
"18465610","18470030"," I expect whatever it does to be taken."
"18470270","18477370"," So if it does blast up here and trade 170 actually 180 or even 170 for those profits to be"
"18477370","18477690"," taken."
"18478110","18484990"," Now my own personal take here is I'm watching this stuff down here and I do not like waste"
"18484990","18485910"," management as well. "
"18485910","18486630"," Just like visa."
"18486990","18488990"," I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop on it."
"18489010","18490350"," It's a good time to drop the shoe. "
"18490610","18492290"," They like to drop the shoe in the fall."
"18492530","18496750"," So I'm bearish on waste management bearish on visa."
"18498170","18501310"," And the next we're going to look at is TXN. "
"18503390","18505750"," Now TXN I like this into this close."
"18506410","18509830"," I've been just gaslighting selling down bad news after bad news."

"18512530","18514010"," See this to this trend right here."
"18514370","18515750"," I'm looking for for visa."
"18516710","18521630"," So I'm looking for waste management and then possibly a nice dip buy down here. "
"18522190","18524730"," So I'm interested to see what Texas Instruments does."
"18525290","18530850"," How bad does it get to the erase this entire move down here right get down here and trade this"
"18530850","18531970"," 10577."

"18542070","18542890"," I might be. "

"18565570","18571150"," Downside targets 139.99 and then further blood eventually down to 10577."
"18571750","18572730"," So short term."
"18573150","18577330"," I like the idea of trading it long calls or something like that. "
"18577890","18582090"," And then and then the long term, of course, I'm pretty fucking bearish for them to go all the way"
"18582090","18583210"," down at 105 bucks."
"18583910","18585810"," So that's TXN right now."
