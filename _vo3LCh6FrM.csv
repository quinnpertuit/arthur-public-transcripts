"_vo3LCh6FrM","1653540","1658300"," hell yeah let's go to the depths of hell it's still not done yet right so you"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","1658300","1662540"," can't this isn't going to work here you need to have one more squeeze up here"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","1706620","1709420"," that but I'm going to expect at that point that we are going to target down"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","1709420","1714060"," here to that 432 we'll talk about that right now if we get that rejection what"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","1714060","1718740"," to do that kind of stuff is the run all over is the bull run all over at that"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","1935140","1940260"," begin to have a continuation of the downside you're going to get a magnet"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","1940260","1945020"," down into end of month to this JPM caller and a pinning action to this"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","1945020","1951340"," sometimes we can actually go come down but this will act as a not as a magnet"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","2444020","2450220"," stuff basically you've got banks you've got dealers and you've got retailers"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2450220","2454180"," basically there's different kinds of groups within that but you need to know"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2454180","2460780"," that and you'll hear things like real money selling and real money buying when"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2460780","2467900"," you hear that right it's referring to these large positional players mostly"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2467900","2475300"," banks if they're selling or buying they can they can force price so where price"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","2489580","2494540"," will get driven up if they find out that I'm selling in a major player prices"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2494540","2499900"," will go down right whenever I'm done doing those things whenever me as a"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","2506300","2511100"," usually where retailers step in and so retailers will step in and they're"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2511100","2515340"," mostly bullish they'll mostly drive the market up generally speaking unless you"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2515340","2521020"," change their sentiment to bearish like you if you scare create sentiment to the"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2521020","2526460"," downside you'll get a an amplification effect if I'm a larger player selling"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2526460","2532380"," I'll have retailers join me I can do that by changing sentiment by going on CNBC"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2532380","2536620"," going to Bloomberg news all that kind of stuff so when you hear that stuff there's"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2536620","2539980"," an impact on that when I'm real money selling and I could impact retailers"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2539980","2545220"," doing that I can control the market and I can also overrun dealers now if I'm"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2545220","2550340"," a big player and I'm not buying or selling dealers take over with retailers"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2550340","2555580"," and if retailers are buying and selling usually dealers will have an impact on"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2555580","2561420"," those retailers you'll see them counter hedging whatever the sentiment is of a"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2561420","2566900"," small money pushing the market around and sometimes they'll actually chase dealers"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2566900","2571500"," will end up having to chase if larger players in the market are found out to"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2571500","2576020"," be buying or selling right rather than delta hedging against that trade they"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2576020","2580380"," end up having to follow that trade and they can amplify a move lower now we"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2580380","2586020"," know these things right now a bank doesn't even like that they don't like"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2586020","2593100"," that banks don't like price discovery in the marketplace so banks put their"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2593100","2597900"," fingers on the marketplace secretly in the background and they do it with"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2597900","2602580"," collars they do it with more than just collars there are other other strategies"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2602580","2606820"," that are actually better better to use but a lot of these big players what"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2606820","2611140"," they're trying to do is kill vol on the marketplace up or down so they have a"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2611140","2616380"," secondary effect on the market when they're not buying or selling and a lot"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2616380","2620740"," of that is through hedging so if you're a if you're a large bank you don't want"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2620740","2626980"," to tell your clients that you have wild returns right markets going crazy up"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2626980","2630100"," quite a great month great month then they had two bad months then a great"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2630100","2634180"," month and you know two bad months they don't like markets that are volatile"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2634180","2639820"," generally speaking banks like markets that trade sideways and up with pullbacks"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2639820","2645540"," every once or major pullbacks once or twice a year some volatility let's call"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2645540","2650140"," it three times max in a year and then a major pullback over time and then start"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2650140","2655700"," the process all over again right to the upside so if I'm a bank and I have client"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2655700","2659500"," if I have institutional clients I've got clients all around the world and I say"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2659500","2665300"," to myself what am I gonna do to stop price volatility once I'm done buying or"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2665300","2669060"," selling this market I'm gonna hedge it and not only am I gonna hedge it but"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2669060","2674100"," other smaller institutions smaller players and some of retail are gonna"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2674100","2679860"," follow that hedging of the marketplace because there's a belief that we're"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2679860","2684940"," gonna go to those numbers so what happens is when they put this hedging on the"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2684940","2691700"," market it actually limits volatility or that or the thesis is that it limits"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2691700","2697060"," volatility in the marketplace so when we have a hedge in the market it tends to"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2697060","2705980"," stop us from going too high right crazy high this is the top here right and"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2705980","2712180"," crazy low to the downside kind of limits our trading range where we should be"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2712220","2716180"," trading now can they get run over absolutely have they ever been run over"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2716180","2722140"," absolutely they have but but normally not and normally they are able to"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2722140","2728380"," actually control how much upside we have and how much downside potential there is"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2728380","2734380"," to the marketplace and so it's like a second or third layer I guess on price"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2734380","2738340"," discovery so as we're trading when you see me say things like hey I want to see"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2738340","2742180"," where the collar is what the expectations are we haven't hit our"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2742180","2747060"," collar yet have we have not tagged this upside to the collar here and the"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2747060","2751260"," expectation is that we were magnetting up here right where we're pellying off of"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2751260","2755820"," it but then also we magnet off it to some point as well and so I'm gonna"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2755820","2759860"," expect that we still go up there at this point that we can still go up there at"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2759860","2766540"," this point and furthermore if we don't begin to regain this level here this"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2766540","2771820"," 44887 we are actually going to magnet to the downside and fill these long"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2771820","2776100"," puts down here for JPM and I'll tell you what I want you guys to know something"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2776100","2781980"," out there if JPM does not care about next quarter they don't care about spring"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2781980","2788620"," times June July they care about the quarter and they would like nothing less"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2788980","2799020"," than for us to trade to trade this this 4-2-1-0 I believe that's 4-2-1-0"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2799020","2805060"," into and of course JPM loves like this nice up move come down nice up move come"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2805060","2810700"," down they love this action and it gives it what it does is they can then sell"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2810700","2816300"," their products to their investors and say hey look every you know for 12 months"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2816300","2822500"," we had 10 great months we had two bad months and we hedged appropriately and"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","2839540","2842860"," can do about that right we got some kind of terrorist attack where you get some"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","2842860","2847260"," kind of I don't fucking know something bad happens or we blow some shit up or"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","4790980","4798020"," probably pretty major one it's call this 10 30 right about there and then into"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","4798020","4806340"," December this would be the expectation right here something like that so there"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","4812420","4817740"," little bit yeah somewhere down in there so you would see a leveling off of this"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","4840180","4845900"," this target here that would be 4500 4600 you'd actually start begin to see us"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","4845900","4854500"," this would be gone at that point no well on air that wouldn't be there"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","4857940","4863340"," you'd actually see the break here and we would actually start heading much much"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","4863340","4866820"," lower you'd actually head down to the weekly which would probably be right"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","4887300","4898340"," you would end up trading 48 44 the upside target then you would end up trading in a"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","4898340","4907620"," breaking below that 4500 this is for new year you'd end up trading 4300 break"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","4907620","4918900"," below that and your next target would be I think 420 and then your February"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","5125900","5130740"," cycle business cycle whatever you want to call it and I my thought here is that"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","5130740","5135580"," there's gonna be an attempt by the Fed and the in the banks to try to if you've"

"_vo3LCh6FrM","5165300","5172060"," think you need to do more and Jerome Powell's point was we are doing enough to"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","5172060","5180100"," try to kill this COVID cycle not quite kill it but but get it to to to stabilize"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","5180100","5183940"," with the regular economy it's not so much that they're trying to just like"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","5183940","5188860"," murder it or anything but you have our grander cycle here we've got this smaller"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","5188860","5194580"," cycle that's kind of fucking with the program right and they really want this"
"_vo3LCh6FrM","5194620","5198180"," cycle to kind of like come up and come down with the with the greater market"
