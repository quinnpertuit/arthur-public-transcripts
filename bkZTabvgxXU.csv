"bkZTabvgxXU","104800","106800"," And mute this hold on here we get some feedback"
"bkZTabvgxXU","107800","112800"," Okay, so this is a different trading rig I'm on the road this morning, so I'm going to try to"
"bkZTabvgxXU","113800","116800"," Do a live stream this morning for you. That's easy"
"bkZTabvgxXU","117800","121800"," Good morning good morning Patrick good morning Bobby good morning one day at a time"
"bkZTabvgxXU","122800","127800"," Good morning Michael and good morning. I lost the toad good morning faith family and business"
"bkZTabvgxXU","127800","129800"," Hope everyone is doing well this morning"
"bkZTabvgxXU","131800","139800"," So I've employed my oldest daughter to try to help me get a tip jar out there this morning if you guys see one down below"
"bkZTabvgxXU","139800","145800"," There it's to help with the cost of production to put this stuff together and to get a"
"bkZTabvgxXU","146800","149800"," Get the tools that I need to put this information out"
"bkZTabvgxXU","149800","152800"," to every day and also"
"bkZTabvgxXU","153800","161800"," Shortly I'm going to put up book map instead of using classic charts for you so that you can see where the liquidity is in real time"
"bkZTabvgxXU","162800","166800"," As we move forward and this morning if I'm still on this morning at the 930 hour"
"bkZTabvgxXU","166800","172800"," I'll put up some flow for you live actual flows so that we can see what the day is doing"
"bkZTabvgxXU","173800","177800"," Now the reason I'm making this video now and not a regular daily brief video"
"bkZTabvgxXU","177800","187800"," is because it's a challenge sometimes to get across to people where we are in the market what's taking place what's happening"
"bkZTabvgxXU","188800","195800"," So the plan for today will be this I will go through this video for you in terms of where we are in the market"
"bkZTabvgxXU","196800","202800"," And then I'm going to also today post what will look like plays"
"bkZTabvgxXU","203800","207800"," that have a chance of printing heavy today so as that flow comes in"
"bkZTabvgxXU","208800","216800"," that'll be the direction for today now you should be taking yesterday in terms of the indexes you want to be taking yesterday and today"
"bkZTabvgxXU","217800","220800"," and the upcoming days as a chance to"
"bkZTabvgxXU","221800","224800"," fall back slightly take a breather and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","225800","228800"," find out where you want to be positioned"
"bkZTabvgxXU","229800","236800"," And the reason I'm saying that is because this is the time when bulls bulls really do get wrecked even though the market is going up"
"bkZTabvgxXU","237800","243800"," If you follow my cursor here I'm going to go over this in a minute but you'll find us going to see this sideways range here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","244800","252800"," You'll see it at this 470 mark all the way down to in reality this 466 mark right in here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","253800","259800"," Okay, and this is a consolidation zone and within this consolidation zone you're going to be looking for"
"bkZTabvgxXU","260800","265800"," For where you feel most confident buying the dip for the next move up"
"bkZTabvgxXU","266800","270800"," And what I really want to get across to all of you out there is this"
"bkZTabvgxXU","271800","276800"," You know that market makers dealers all these people need to be Delta neutral"
"bkZTabvgxXU","276800","287800"," They talk about being Delta neutral being Delta neutral and the same really have the same really applies to you to an extent as a trader as an investor"
"bkZTabvgxXU","288800","290800"," If you're a swing trader day trader"
"bkZTabvgxXU","291800","297800"," You're looking for to be to be Delta new well in my view what I would consider a traders Delta neutral"
"bkZTabvgxXU","298800","304800"," For how you trade this market and my point behind that is this let's get a little bit closer here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","304800","309800"," I want to explain something to you so we know that liquidity is down here somewhere right it's below"
"bkZTabvgxXU","310800","316800"," It's below this what I have here tagged below this 468 16"
"bkZTabvgxXU","317800","323800"," And also at 467 65 right we know that down here there's this big whale down here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","323800","330800"," This is like a liquidity whale like a little ocean flowing and they decide when they're going to come up to buy the market or not"
"bkZTabvgxXU","331800","336800"," If the market is looking weak that whale is going to go a little bit deeper in the ocean right?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","337800","343800"," And so you have to think for yourself as a trader or an investor well where do I want to buy in here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","344800","352800"," Now if you buy down here at this 464 level you're almost Delta neutral if you go upright here right it's all profit city"
"bkZTabvgxXU","352800","360800"," If we start to go down from this 464 number then you can cut your losses and know that you can take short here right?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","361800","364800"," So just picture yourself as your own little market maker"
"bkZTabvgxXU","365800","372800"," You know you want to be buying the dip as deep as 4600 or 46400 or 4640"
"bkZTabvgxXU","373800","379800"," Right and you start to take on more risk as we head up here to move forward and higher"
"bkZTabvgxXU","380800","384800"," So that's how I look at it as a trader I look at it as on a daily basis"
"bkZTabvgxXU","385800","389800"," What news events do we have coming what's the market sentiment?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","390800","394800"," And then what's the where's the weakness in the markets?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","395800","401800"," And do I just take a trade that's short for just today like yesterday right I said yesterday I'm not taking this trade"
"bkZTabvgxXU","402800","406800"," But I know that some will this trade worked out just fine as a day trade yesterday"
"bkZTabvgxXU","407800","412800"," More than likely it worked best if you were in a spread or a farther outdated call than an FD"
"bkZTabvgxXU","412800","415800"," But this was worth taking in some respect yesterday"
"bkZTabvgxXU","416800","422800"," The other thing I talked about yesterday was during this consolidation phase that flies or condors would do you well"
"bkZTabvgxXU","423800","425800"," And we can see now that that is the case"
"bkZTabvgxXU","426800","430800"," Now in this consolidation phase that's the thing that you have to think about is where do I want to buy the dip?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","431800","434800"," Do I want to buy it at 4640?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","435800","442800"," Don't want to buy it at 4660 8 in case I miss out this morning or this week because that's a possibility as well right"
"bkZTabvgxXU","443800","445800"," And then you have to start to consider what events we have coming ahead"
"bkZTabvgxXU","446800","452800"," We know today that we've got the 10 year or the 30 I think it's a 30 year auction today at 1 p.m"
"bkZTabvgxXU","453800","456800"," That could lend to a moment of weakness heading into the one o'clock hour"
"bkZTabvgxXU","457800","460800"," Those are the moments where you want to be buying the dip a little bit deeper"
"bkZTabvgxXU","461800","467800"," And I'll put some other some other support lines down here for you this morning so that you can see where some of them are"
"bkZTabvgxXU","468800","470800"," We've got a half back somewhere down here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","472800","474800"," And that push up yesterday"
"bkZTabvgxXU","475800","479800"," I want to say that's the half back somewhere in here is another buy zone"
"bkZTabvgxXU","479800","482800"," You see this other buy zone right down in here right"
"bkZTabvgxXU","483800","488800"," So it's somewhere down in here and what I want you to understand is as we go into weakness"
"bkZTabvgxXU","488800","493800"," Coming into these upcoming days. We've got remember. We've got weakness here, right?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","493800","499800"," Then we've got some more weakness at 8 30 a.m. on Friday with CPI data"
"bkZTabvgxXU","500800","502800"," And let me go me"
"bkZTabvgxXU","506800","509800"," So you've see you've got this trading channel with range bound in here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","510800","513800"," And then you're going to see that we're going to find some weakness down below here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","513800","517800"," As long as we don't break the 46 40 level"
"bkZTabvgxXU","518800","522800"," Then especially when I'm with some waiting for that CPI data"
"bkZTabvgxXU","522800","527800"," That's my real date that I'm waiting for I'm waiting for Friday morning to find out what that CPI data says"
"bkZTabvgxXU","528800","530800"," If it's bad for the cash market"
"bkZTabvgxXU","531800","538800"," I'm going to wait to see if we bounce off 46 40 if we start to break through at 46 40 that's bear country down there"
"bkZTabvgxXU","538800","543800"," Our next target after 46 40 is 46 0 0 believe it or not"
"bkZTabvgxXU","543800","549800"," So we could have a major sell-off now if we don't major sell-off and we get a reaction on 46 40"
"bkZTabvgxXU","549800","555800"," Let's say the news is bad. I'm going to look for that as one of my entries to take this market long up here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","555800","559800"," Into or for a target date of the Thursday before"
"bkZTabvgxXU","560800","562800"," FOMC on the 17th"
"bkZTabvgxXU","562800","568800"," So maybe I'll mark my calls a week later after that or an expiration date or two later"
"bkZTabvgxXU","568800","573800"," So that I don't get hammered right on the intro I'm losing intrinsic value over this time period"
"bkZTabvgxXU","573800","577800"," But this is really the date that I'm looking for so for me today"
"bkZTabvgxXU","578800","586800"," If there's any weakness in the 10 year treasury if CPI data starts to drop us down as long as we don't go below"
"bkZTabvgxXU","587800","592800"," 46 40 then I'm safe as a bull right so let's go back"
"bkZTabvgxXU","597240","602440"," So so my point to you is this as a day trade right we're looking for some weakness today"
"bkZTabvgxXU","602440","611320"," We know that buyers are we know for buyers on a day trade basis or somewhere between 466 and this 468"
"bkZTabvgxXU","611320","616160"," Let's say area right in here for day trading. This is where potential buyers are right in here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","616160","620520"," Okay, we know that if we had any new bad news or we get any volatility"
"bkZTabvgxXU","621120","625680"," Things we don't understand there is going or we things that are unknown to the market"
"bkZTabvgxXU","625680","630480"," If you start to see really bad news come out today and they're harping on it being bad news"
"bkZTabvgxXU","630680","637960"," We know that we can buy the dip down below here at this 46 level 4588 level and we know that as a bull"
"bkZTabvgxXU","638720","644400"," That we're safe to 46 40. We know that we know that this is all by the dip area"
"bkZTabvgxXU","644640","648240"," Bears, you know that you can only go so deep here and bears"
"bkZTabvgxXU","648240","653160"," I want you to definitely understand this morning. Let's say we start selling off today or tomorrow"
"bkZTabvgxXU","653440","657200"," Down to this 46 48 zone down here. I would absolutely"
"bkZTabvgxXU","657840","664440"," Close my shorts and we approach this for if we start to break through these levels and we touch 46 40"
"bkZTabvgxXU","664440","665600"," If I was a bear"
"bkZTabvgxXU","665600","672760"," I would at least get out for a bounce and see if it can break through to go deeper to that 46 0 0 level"
"bkZTabvgxXU","672920","679720"," And that's my basic plan for right now, and it's been working very well the past well works every day generally speaking"
"bkZTabvgxXU","679720","684920"," You know if you if you watch these videos that I make you'll notice that I'm right"
"bkZTabvgxXU","685440","693240"," 70% of the time 80 90% of the time within reason so you should use these things these tools that I'm putting out here for you"
"bkZTabvgxXU","693920","698040"," Or these concepts to just plan your day no matter what you're trading"
"bkZTabvgxXU","698280","704360"," Yeah, and I post I posted on this on on my other handle your key levels for"
"bkZTabvgxXU","705040","708320"," the cues for I don't I don't do the cues that you"
"bkZTabvgxXU","708720","716880"," Nq and I did the rut and then I post every morning a little like white sheet note paper that shows you"
"bkZTabvgxXU","717160","725040"," Where the buyers are and where the sellers are and even just those two basic numbers for each index and the cues"
"bkZTabvgxXU","725520","729960"," I put those on there too, but even on those basic numbers. I think yesterday I had"
"bkZTabvgxXU","730560","734360"," 396 and 400 I'm not exactly what I posted yesterday"
"bkZTabvgxXU","734600","738080"," But you can just basically use those every day as this is where I'm gonna buy"
"bkZTabvgxXU","738160","742080"," This is where I'm gonna sell if we break through that bottom number. I'm gonna turn bear"
"bkZTabvgxXU","742720","749040"," This is all basic trading stuff and then let's say and I know a lot of you guys like to play stocks"
"bkZTabvgxXU","749760","753320"," I'm trying I'm trying to get together a way to"
"bkZTabvgxXU","754320","758560"," Be more concise and what I'm posting for you"
"bkZTabvgxXU","759400","761400"," So you should see me start"
"bkZTabvgxXU","761560","763840"," Last week I was doing great with it yesterday"
"bkZTabvgxXU","763840","767400"," I tried or I launched some trading tech stuff"
"bkZTabvgxXU","767400","773760"," And I'm not as impressed with trading ticks yet. I need to make it more concise for you so you can target your"
"bkZTabvgxXU","774720","781280"," Strength towards one two or three stocks. I think I have a better luck with flow algo targeting those stocks for you"
"bkZTabvgxXU","781840","788320"," So I'm gonna switch back to flow algo today and work on the trading ticks or work on trade ticks trying to"
"bkZTabvgxXU","789240","793000"," Whittle down to the best that comes out of that site for you"
"bkZTabvgxXU","793920","798720"," So I'm gonna look over right now and check your I'm gonna look over right now and just check your comments right now"
"bkZTabvgxXU","798720","800920"," If you guys have any questions this morning about"
"bkZTabvgxXU","802040","809040"," Let's see we got good morning captain good morning Randall. Good morning Josh. Good morning HP T-Chrone. Good morning"
"bkZTabvgxXU","809800","815360"," Philip good morning dragon wolf and James good morning, brother. James Andy. Good to see ya"
"bkZTabvgxXU","816360","821120"," We got 66 watching right now right on so you guys have any questions for me this morning"
"bkZTabvgxXU","823520","829080"," Anything that's you're not understanding as to where the buy zones are where we're selling"
"bkZTabvgxXU","829400","833440"," Do you guys have no worth with a trigger it or and that's one last thing to explain is"
"bkZTabvgxXU","833880","840720"," the one positive thing about this this morning is that we are raising currently raising the"
"bkZTabvgxXU","841920","843920"," Volatility zone up here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","844000","846000"," The volatility trigger was at"
"bkZTabvgxXU","846640","851920"," 4,700 4,700 earlier in the week and we now have some higher targets"
"bkZTabvgxXU","852600","856680"," For when we sell yesterday's target to sell was 4,700"
"bkZTabvgxXU","857040","862520"," I'm now today looking for 4,7,1.23. I think we might get there today and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","863440","866200"," It's possible. We could go to 4,7,1 point"
"bkZTabvgxXU","867880","869880"," 4,7,1,2"
"bkZTabvgxXU","871320","876920"," 4,7,1,9 somewhere in there we could actually go higher today because as we are moving our way along"
"bkZTabvgxXU","877360","884760"," consolidating the ceiling is being raised it's going to eventually get raised to 4,7,5,0 and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","885400","893400"," Potentially to 4,800 the longer we stay in this area here the higher the ceiling becomes the higher that call wall gets put"
"bkZTabvgxXU","893680","898400"," So this is also key information that you need to know today as we move forward"
"bkZTabvgxXU","899400","900800"," All right questions"
"bkZTabvgxXU","900800","906560"," We have a lot of bull trap bulls trapped at 4,7 the flow yesterday was insane. That is correct MA"
"bkZTabvgxXU","906560","909560"," And these same bulls will"
"bkZTabvgxXU","910160","919600"," Actually fuel a larger move up as these bulls are trapped in an area where they're not they're they're they're encountering pain"
"bkZTabvgxXU","920080","922080"," But they're not"
"bkZTabvgxXU","922120","926880"," completely dead yet. So what happens is we'll begin to start trading down and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","927280","936080"," They will add more money and fuel to the next rip higher and they might even sell out in desperation to this liquidity"
"bkZTabvgxXU","937000","939000"," Zone down here so that"
"bkZTabvgxXU","939480","944280"," The banks and institutions can buy cheaper calls to send us much higher"
"bkZTabvgxXU","944480","949960"," Thought on unusual whales see it pushed a ton on"
"bkZTabvgxXU","950720","956960"," Fit fin to it, but mainly used by small accounts, you know, I've got nothing bad to say about anybody else does"
"bkZTabvgxXU","956960","960560"," I am not a an unusual whales user"
"bkZTabvgxXU","960840","967320"," You know one of my issues that I have in this market is that I feel is the or in social media specifically is"
"bkZTabvgxXU","968640","971040"," I can't ever seem to get"
"bkZTabvgxXU","972160","973760"," actionable"
"bkZTabvgxXU","973760","975760"," direct direct actionable"
"bkZTabvgxXU","977200","985160"," Moves that I can make in the market. I feel like there's a lot of noise. I feel like people are putting out either either too much information"
"bkZTabvgxXU","985920","993520"," That I can't focus and drill down into making money in this market or it's mystifying"
"bkZTabvgxXU","993520","998120"," it's like this crystal ball that you can't really understand and I think people are"
"bkZTabvgxXU","998800","1006760"," Are one of those two ways one because they don't want to be held accountable for for saying things because they're often wrong and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1007720","1010920"," Then I think other people mystify it for that same reason"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1010920","1015920"," You know, you'll always see people on social media and they will never tell you what their trades are"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1016720","1021000"," I post all my trades. You can see when I win. You can see when I lose"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1022400","1024560"," You can see me as a real trader"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1025240","1028360"," My issue is with me as a trader"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1028920","1035480"," I'm out there in social media and what am I here for? I'm here to learn of course, but I'm also here to get actionable"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1038400","1040400"," Intel right I guess intelligence"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1041440","1046400"," That I can parse through and decipher so let's say if I put up flow on flow"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1046400","1050560"," I'll go for you guys. I know a lot of you guys will look at that stuff and be like well"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1050560","1052560"," I don't know what that means to me"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1053520","1058280"," All right, put up I put up I can put up any of these trading ticks. I can put any of it up"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1058280","1063160"," I can put post things ad nauseam and it's difficult for traders"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1064480","1066480"," To parse in that little basket"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1067280","1069520"," What to actually take so what I do?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1070400","1073400"," They try to I try to parse that information down for you"

"bkZTabvgxXU","1101360","1107080"," That's unusual whales. How do you measure put walls and call walls? Okay, that's a great question"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1107840","1114280"," So how you're measuring these these walls are by how many puts and calls are"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1114560","1117080"," bought sold when they're expiring and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1118040","1123400"," That and then you have to also add in volatility or excuse me volatility from the VIX"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1125280","1127880"," Excuse me, so you're looking for"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1128480","1131720"," Events right known events that we know are coming down the pike"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1132560","1138040"," That adds levels of volatility to the market and then you have to be tracking"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1138360","1142600"," Where all the puts are where all the calls are how many there are when are there?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1143520","1145040"," expiration dates"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1145040","1151440"," You're looking for inflows a volume into the market. So you're looking at what volume right time?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1152200","1156800"," Right, which is the dates and then you're looking for price"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1157240","1161320"," You're looking for when people are entering when they're exiting the markets"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1161720","1165600"," And so you come up with these walls you come up with a wall on the bottom and on the top now"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1165600","1170440"," These walls can move at any time as well, and that's what we when we talk about volatility"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1170440","1175440"," We talk about them compressing and expanding we talk about what events can trigger"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1177000","1182480"," The sell selling we could always also talk about events that can trigger liquidity going away"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1182560","1189400"," So let's say down here. We've got this big river of liquidity down here, and we encounter an event like"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1190040","1191400"," today's"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1191400","1196080"," 10 or 30-year auction and let's say today's 30-year auction is horrible, right?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1196400","1202200"," That's let's say it's horrible for cash market and we start to sell down the liquidity will go away"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1202840","1208880"," Until that problem or issue in the market solves itself. So as that liquidity goes away"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1209440","1214360"," We start to look for where is we start to look for where is the put wall?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1214400","1218440"," Which is down here at this 40 or 46 40?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1218440","1220200"," And what what you say to yourself?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1220200","1228960"," Well, why does this wall down here important and the reason is because as we come down you start to print the hedge that's down here"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1229640","1236040"," Once you print that hedge that's down there. You have dealers and broker. Well, they're in this context"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1236040","1242920"," They're the same dealers brokers market makers. They are selling these puts right to large"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1243360","1247160"," Institutions and they need to buy them back cheaply, right?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1247160","1253280"," So they want to start to hedge above and get people to buy this market to go up and to make this hedge"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1253600","1258640"," Dirt cheap so they don't lose money on this edge down below here. Does it make sense to any of you out there?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1258640","1264160"," I don't think it does. Maybe it does. How do you know the buyers are like the wheels of four sixes?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1264160","1269280"," That's the key. How do you know the buyers are there like whales? Okay, James?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1269280","1273080"," How do I know the buyers are there? There are order flow"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1273760","1279320"," Programs that you can use I use book map and I'll have that up for you and it shows"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1279680","1285520"," Where buy orders are at in the markets? You'll see huge liquidity at certain levels and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1286080","1293840"," This program that I use also shows spoofing. This is where you hear about bull traps and bear traps and stuff like that"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1293960","1296760"," You'll have hedge funds boiler rooms"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1296760","1301040"," They'll put fake orders in trying to tease down buyers or tease down"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1301640","1308560"," Sellers to where they're located then they disappear and it will trick fake or fake outs to move the market lower"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1308680","1313280"," So I will start oh, I'm gonna put this book map up for you guys at some point soon"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1313280","1321000"," I want you though to get a firm understanding of what I'm talking about on the charts because most of you guys can't afford to use this"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1321080","1324040"," Software most of you guys aren't gonna have this software"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1324720","1330800"," So I need you guys eat to see on just a basic chart how to find this stuff"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1331000","1339240"," if you're given these levels each day or you know where these levels are all you're looking for really is news events that"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1339440","1345200"," are negative real news events not fake ones real upcoming known news events or"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1346040","1355240"," Unknown negative new news events that can drop this market or push it higher most of the other news is manufactured to"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1357720","1362160"," What would you say would to amplify that negative or positive news piece?"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1362320","1367560"," That's either unknown or a planned event. So you always start with what we know is coming and"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1368440","1371040"," Then you never want to see something that we don't know right"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1371920","1373440"," even"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1373440","1380400"," Even hedge funds and banks don't like positive news sometimes and you ever notice how you'll see a positive news story drop that nobody knows"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1381520","1389520"," Sometimes you'll have an immediate spike and then it sells right off. Okay, that's because banks and hedge funds want to get better"
"bkZTabvgxXU","1389880","1394440"," Positioning to fuel another rally in this market. Oh, hold on here. What do we got?"
