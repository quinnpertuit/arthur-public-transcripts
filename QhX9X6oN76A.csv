"310","1130"," Before the film begins."
"1830","2550"," Check one two."
"6330","8150"," I need to get that done today. "
"9850","15370"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"15370","17110"," before the film begins."
"20610","23610"," Good morning."
"62020","63319"," Why is that all?"
"69540","71080"," They're like changing stuff. "
"73300","74380"," Good morning."
"74580","75540"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"76880","89600"," I hope everybody's doing"
"89600","90040"," well."
"91040","96160"," I did add two Friday calls on the dip on daily trigger. "
"96860","99360"," So if you had a chance to do that, we'll talk about that this morning."
"101400","107900"," I also pay attention this morning to TMF."
"109100","110740"," Get right into it. "
"117120","118900"," So I wanted to buy yesterday."
"120800","121800"," One dates."
"122400","123320"," Let's take a look here. "
"126560","130900"," So I wanted to buy one dates yesterday down here, given the chance."
"131280","132080"," Wasn't given the chance."
"134620","137200"," So I did add to that Friday position here. "
"137660","139920"," I didn't sell the open here because it was Friday calls."
"140460","144660"," We did get our PT 450 69 here."
"145320","149760"," Although I think we, well, you have a chance to go back up there and at least trade that in"
"149760","150400"," cash market. "
"151860","154320"," So we'll see if we trade this here in this cash market."
"154480","155820"," There's a PT above for you."
"156780","159020"," The old giant gap left behind here. "
"160900","162640"," I got ringing in my ears right now."
"164220","166980"," This is another place here to be paying attention to."
"172300","174140"," So right in there, pay attention to this. "
"174300","175540"," You don't want to see a rejection here."
"178220","179740"," That would be a reversal trend."
"180240","185480"," So yes, they were pointing out two things yesterday. "
"185900","188840"," First thing would be that we have the reversal and trend here."
"190420","192080"," Trade this up real nice, right?"
"192520","195880"," Came back down, held that straight back up to the moon."
"197060","200380"," And you've got some hit and run selling going on down here. "
"200840","203400"," So far, this is holding up to trade even higher."
"203920","213060"," So we'll check in here and see if this here proves to be real resistance in cash market or not."
"214850","217250"," We'll come back and revisit this in just a second here. "
"218270","220430"," You don't want to see this break right here."
"220510","222010"," So I did add some calls down here."
"222950","229030"," This morning, if this begins to break or reverse course to the downside, we'll switch from calls to"
"229030","229250"," puts. "
"234100","235520"," We get a lot to go over this morning."
"238680","239340"," Just a second."
"239340","240580"," I got a ton of stuff I got to do. "
"244690","256959"," Members only details like every"
"256959","262980"," morning I have to switch like comments to newest instead of top."
"264860","266460"," They're like doesn't matter every morning."
"266460","267480"," I got to go through this and. "
"268880","272340"," Like YouTube has a lot of legacy stuff in it that."
"275980","278860"," Every morning I switch to touch anything."
"278960","280640"," Once you said it, you kind of forget it. "
"282360","283520"," YouTube not so much."
"286710","288790"," So I did add some calls here for Friday."
"289010","289390"," I had a chance. "
"289510","290350"," We'll go over this right now."
"290350","291710"," We'll go over it one more time."
"292310","294510"," Everybody pile into into the room. "
"297320","307320"," Trying to build a secondary office right now so they can put a second stream up."
"307600","312300"," I'm not here or unavailable to stream and it's killing me."
"312400","314180"," It's not done yet still to this point. "
"314380","320320"," Still not done this over here."
"320500","328060"," Actually, let's mute book map here."
"328200","328580"," Hold on here. "
"333100","333940"," Let's go to the."
"334320","335420"," Let's go to the full."
"341920","343580"," To the full weevil chart here. "
"346840","349540"," Let's get my eye here on TMF right."
"349900","351780"," So I added this some TMF this morning."
"351780","352660"," It's going higher. "
"353900","355780"," Just the heads up on TMF today."
"355840","357480"," It should be a trend day for it."
"358140","359680"," There's not a ton of people in the. "
"361300","362720"," Oh yeah, they're up right now."
"362880","363960"," So they're in the money right now."
"364940","368920"," So 6.5 C's for the 11th. "
"370600","372040"," It's cranking right now."
"372320","374360"," There's not a ton of liquidity in this stuff."
"374860","378240"," You kind of have to hold it and hold it and hold it and hold it. "
"379420","382040"," But just for the 11 just heads up here."
"385420","391890"," TMF 6.59. There's a much larger move up here."
"392010","392550"," It's seven bucks. "
"392870","394190"," Close all this stuff back here."
"395050","397670"," It's actually even a bigger move on TMF."
"398730","400010"," Let's keep your eyes on it. "
"400890","402970"," I'm long this right now for the 11th."
"403130","405890"," I traded this back here I think."
"406330","408330"," Old days ago I traded this all day long. "
"409190","409870"," It's a good trade."
"410990","414570"," I'm in this trade once again for the 9th, 10th, 11th."
"418140","420880"," 6.5 C trying to get a stink bit on them. "
"422040","424140"," They were they're trading at the."
"424140","426800"," The bid mask is kind of kind of high."
"428220","432880"," If you catch on a low, you can usually catch for like 12 cents, but the ask right now is"
"432880","436080"," 15 and every time we pump it, it's going to. "
"438710","440710"," You know, they're going to ask you for more than it's worth."
"441830","444130"," But it can be a four or 500% printer."
"445710","449630"," You can get if we can get up here in the $7 range somewhere up in here at some point"
"449630","450270"," in TMF. "
"454370","455910"," Now back to spy down here."
"459280","460540"," And we'll talk about that."
"460620","462120"," Put the thumbnail up on the video this morning. "
"462240","468360"," I'm not sure if I did or didn't take something real quick."
"474820","476380"," I did I put the thumbnail up good."
"496180","500080"," See a nice little trench so you get a nice little trend change here yesterday, right?"
"500920","501300"," Coming up. "
"501500","502680"," Oh, yeah, get up here."
"503780","505600"," They sell back down before the open."
"506020","507820"," They start to blast down right here. "
"508480","511720"," And sellers want to do the same thing they've been doing right."
"511720","512820"," They're casing us down."
"513260","515240"," They just look here in previous history. "
"518380","523059"," They're coming above here trying to sell this here, sell this here, sell, sell."
"523720","526100"," They want nothing more than to sell this down again."
"526780","530940"," There is something going on in the background here to pay attention to. "
"532000","537620"," So whatever weakness we do have in the market right now, this one thing that I'm watching in the"
"537620","538340"," background here."
"539340","547000"," Is the relationship between price and the trigger."
"547500","554040"," So it's a 30 minute chart on spy right now. "
"555360","559600"," And I'm not as concerned with where price goes."
"560860","563740"," I'm mostly concerned where the trigger goes."
"565440","569720"," Now the trigger is magneting to the daily trigger. "
"570220","575620"," And price or triggers actually going up as price comes down."
"575940","578220"," So it's showing strength in the daily trigger."
"579300","584100"," Now there are times where price can break below daily trigger. "
"588060","593240"," In an attractive manner, but trigger continues to go sideways or up."
"593240","594460"," Not down."
"595580","599380"," So I'm watching Bello too over here to see what Bello is saying. "
"599540","602040"," But I want to give you guys an idea of what I'm talking about here."
"606680","609180"," Bear with me, my office is all fucked up."
"609920","612440"," So let me give you an idea of what I'm talking about here. "
"612600","622400"," I want you to see a correction like this here."
"623240","624440"," This is a prime example."
"625880","628140"," You can see that price breaks. "
"628140","630820"," You can see that price breaks below the trigger."
"631620","632800"," It's the yellow line right here."
"634080","636960"," The trigger is continuing sideways and up. "
"637540","638740"," Climbing the wall of worry."
"640760","644160"," You're not getting a following of trigger to the downside."
"645420","647960"," You see how that yellow line does not follow price lower. "
"650320","652040"," We need to pay attention to that there."
"652200","653120"," It's very, very important."
"653580","659620"," The reason for that is because even if you get, you know, some kind of like rollover like we did"
"659620","662480"," here in October of 2020. "
"663380","663820"," Nice."
"664020","666500"," You still don't see a point of pay attention."
"666620","672220"," It's very important for you to see this here that the yellow trigger is not following price down. "
"672440","675000"," This is even more of a more of a bloodbath, right?"
"675220","677960"," This is actually an actual correction down here."
"678180","685620"," And right now we're not seeing as of yet any kind of yellow line crossing down."
"688320","689900"," Crossing down with price. "
"690420","690600"," Okay."
"690780","693620"," And this is kind of the warning sign right here if you see that."
"693980","697560"," So pay attention to this yellow line is now coming down, right?"
"698340","700580"," And this is actually signaling a rollover. "
"700860","704520"," Even with that rollover, you have another chance to exit the market above here."
"705660","709780"," And we have previous instances of that every time we get an actual top."
"710000","712620"," So just right now watching right now. "
"712620","718100"," Not seeing price and the trigger go lower."
"718420","728090"," In fact, watching the daily trigger rise as days pass."
"729710","734150"," So even if we were weak here, I'm watching. "
"734530","736070"," This is, this is what I'm going to talk to you about."
"736170","736970"," This is called the wall worry."
"737530","741570"," This is when you get early exitters in the market. "
"741570","745950"," And you climb the wall of worry the entire way up."
"746130","748870"," And this, of course, if you look at the thumbnail in this video."
"749650","753810"," It says performance maxers on it or something like that performance. "
"754050","754370"," That's me."
"755370","757890"," I'm looking for performance, maximizing performance."
"758070","760690"," I'm like, hey, do I stay long on the underlying?"
"761590","766490"," And do I just grind down, hold this shit and just run it out. "
"767250","769030"," You get an exit of weak hands here too."
"769730","772150"," I wind up being in this exiting of weak hands."
"772650","777550"," You get these permabairs. "
"778790","780410"," Let's say an SPX really quick."
"783760","785700"," I saw someone yesterday."
"786260","790000"," I saw a video last night from a well respected institution. "
"790680","791720"," I'm not going to name names."
"792400","795440"," And they're like, oh, let's go back over here."
"795600","796580"," That was like scratching man. "
"798840","803280"," You know, they're like, is this the biggest double top in history?"
"803280","805040"," And I'm like, yeah, my fucking face."
"805700","809760"," You know, and then you've got me down here going, oh, no, that's a cup and handle."
"810320","812660"," We're just going to rip some faces off up here. "
"813380","814240"," You know what I'm saying?"
"816100","819320"," And we're going to get some violence as we go up there too, right?"
"819460","823140"," We're going to get told you about how you're going to get vol as we head higher to all time"
"823140","823440"," highs."
"824580","829160"," And meanwhile, you get a lot of bulls that are like listening to the bears right now."
"829700","830440"," That's the top. "
"830660","831760"," It ain't never coming back."
"831980","833060"," And that's not how this market works."
"833200","833820"," We know that, right?"
"834700","839120"," This market, there's a thesis being portrayed out there. "
"839540","840860"," There's a thesis out here."
"842160","844280"," I'm going to warn you of something."
"844440","854700"," There's a thesis being pushed out there that the S&P 500 is meant to go up come down, go"
"854700","861580"," up, come down, go up, come down, go up, come down over the years and decades. "
"863000","867580"," Somehow like there's like we erase everything else going back to 1900."
"868980","875240"," And you now want the S&P 500 or we're going to pretend that it was never down here."
"876080","879060"," The S&P 500 started at 15,000. "
"879580","883780"," And the natural progression of the S&P 500 is to the downside."
"884900","890040"," I got news for you that is not the natural progression of the S&P 500."
"891020","895160"," The natural progression of the S&P 500 is up into the right. "
"896280","900940"," So, you know, just because we come up here, that's pretty fucking simple."
"901930","909680"," You know, when we go down, we go up, we don't come up to this previous high and then start"
"909680","911120"," heading down to new lows."
"911120","912740"," We're going to zero one day. "
"913500","914700"," It's not how it works."
"915300","924880"," So, even that thesis being pushed out there, you know, the thesis here, the main thesis here is, oh"
"924880","926800"," look, we're close to all-time highs."
"928180","930000"," Time to go down to zero now. "
"930000","931180"," Like that's just not it."
"931280","932240"," It's not how it works."
"932680","933280"," I'm sorry. "
"933880","937060"," No matter what you think, that's not how it works."
"937180","939680"," And that's not what the facts support."
"941120","948580"," There are thousands of examples in previous history where we roll over thousands. "
"950040","951520"," There's like one right here, right?"
"951740","952540"," There's one right there."
"952720","953600"," There's one right there."
"953980","954660"," There's one right there. "
"954760","955520"," There's one right there."
"955660","956460"," There's one right there."
"958500","959520"," You know what I'm saying?"
"960500","967840"," So, this thesis that we're close to all-time highs, and so this is the top, you know, it holds"
"967840","969340"," no weight or nor water. "
"969740","975640"," And furthermore, just looking at where we are in the marketplace, you get one pullback and we're"
"975640","976740"," still on daily trigger."
"977700","979000"," And it's the end of the world."
"979200","980560"," Can you imagine living like that?"
"981540","985300"," Come back to a daily trigger and you've got the end of the worlders out there talking to you about"
"985300","985580"," how. "
"986520","987460"," That was the high."
"987640","988720"," We're never coming back to it again."
"988820","990840"," We failed and doom and gloom are going to zero. "
"991320","991920"," How are you?"
"992080","992460"," Fucking mind."
"993040","993620"," All right, wait."
"993740","997540"," I saved the F until the, until 15 minutes into the stream. "
"998420","1002180"," So just as we get there, check out that thumbnail this morning."
"1003080","1005100"," You've got early people that want to X early."
"1005280","1005700"," I get that. "
"1005940","1007420"," We cans want to get out early."
"1007560","1011740"," Then you've got performance maxers that want to rip up here."
"1012100","1013940"," Get that all-time high and get that roll. "
"1014340","1015860"," And it's not going to be an easy ride."
"1016100","1017240"," We did a video about this."
"1017760","1021840"," We did a video about this on two weeks ago or a week ago. "
"1021840","1022120"," I don't know."
"1022200","1024599"," It was the last Sunday of the Sunday before, two Sundays ago."
"1025240","1027020"," We did a video on this late at night. "
"1027720","1028800"," I don't know what time it was."
"1028900","1029520"," Nine o'clock at night."
"1029619","1033380"," We spent two hours, I think, going over this as we're up here. "
"1033440","1034060"," It's not going to be fun."
"1034160","1034619"," It's not going to be pretty."
"1035280","1040060"," And I'm kind of amazed right now that this entire run right here. "
"1040060","1046260"," And you think that the first time we even test the daily trigger, that's it."
"1046859","1048800"," It's like it's so bizarre."
"1050120","1051160"," It's so bizarre. "
"1051640","1055560"," So just my point here is that you should be scaling out a little bit."
"1055740","1060520"," Two spot three million on the prior minus seventeen spot zero four nine million with a range of"
"1060520","1063920"," five spot two two one million to minus one spot five million."
"1063920","1065320"," Skill out a little bit. "
"1065640","1072860"," And not only that, even if we get a real actual correction in the marketplace, that daily trigger"
"1072860","1076260"," is three eight six million on the prime minus zero spot seven."
"1076580","1082400"," So even if you get a correction here, even if we even we trade down trade four forty, even if"
"1082400","1087180"," we trade four twenty five, if daily trigger is not following along with that with that correction,"
"1087180","1090300"," it's not a time to panic."
"1090300","1096680"," And I think that's the big, I think that's the bigger lesson where we are here. "
"1097800","1099160"," Is that no, I'm sorry."
"1099580","1101160"," That's not how this stock market goes."
"1101320","1103060"," The stock market does not go down. "
"1104420","1111740"," If anything, you would turn this chart upside down and know that this is a secondary bottom, right?"
"1112120","1115200"," So you look, you're always looking for higher bottoms and stuff like that, higher lows."
"1116000","1119780"," The stock market does not operate in the in the opposite of that."
"1120140","1121100"," Does that make sense?"
"1121460","1127240"," Over time, the stock market does not look for lower highs to go lower to fucking zero. "
"1129380","1134600"," That's why we're at five thousand right now and not like five."
"1136930","1137870"," Does that make sense?"
"1138750","1143290"," I don't know how to explain that any better to you out there."
"1144050","1147210"," So that's some of the, that's some of the arguments that's going on right now. "
"1147770","1149890"," You know, and it's just kind of a head scratcher."
"1150910","1152310"," It's kind of a head scratcher."
"1152910","1159710"," Just a little bit of head scratcher in, in, in some of what's being told out there. "
"1164540","1169720"," So just the, just the worldview going back to the, to the video from last Sunday."
"1170680","1175980"," Uh, minus seventy one cents right now, we're going to go back to the, uh, the sitting here in the"
"1175980","1178000"," deli triggers, see if they can roll this down."
"1178000","1180420"," Any kind of break of this stuff down here. "
"1180820","1185100"," And I'm going to switch over to puts and cut my, uh, my lungs for Friday."
"1185100","1187940"," But right now it's looking kind of bearish, not looking bullish air."
"1188160","1193260"," But even with this bearishness here, the key points going to bring you back to this again is that. "
"1193860","1199980"," Well, you're not seeing, you are not seeing the deli trigger roll over with this market."
"1200280","1206120"," So any of this, uh, drama, any of this price action that you're seeing in the market is not"
"1206120","1207020"," relevant to."
"1207020","1208760"," Uh, where we're headed. "
"1209160","1212160"," So there's a thesis being pushed out there right now."
"1212720","1215720"," Uh, that that was the top and we're not going back up there."
"1215800","1217540"," We're not going to get any other highs. "
"1217880","1223060"," Uh, that the run, the bull run, the bull market, all that stuff is over and it's just not showing"
"1223060","1225600"," that there's nothing in the background saying."
"1226360","1232900"," Uh, that this pullback or correction is in any way, shape or form related to a top in the market."
"1232900","1234100"," There's nothing showing that. "
"1234200","1236980"," I need to see more, uh, for that to be the case."
"1237240","1237360"," So."
"1238180","1243020"," Now, so just be aware of that after where we are right now and be aware of that for, uh,"
"1243340","1247320"," the, uh, the sellers out there because there are people out there that are short that max short"
"1247320","1247860"," this market. "
"1248620","1253640"," There's also a trade going on right now for the end of September."
"1254400","1257220"," Uh, for a greater correction in September."
"1257220","1262600"," Uh, there's a ton of put spreads out there for mid to late. "
"1262660","1268840"," I believe it's like September 21st to September 30th for an actual correction in that time period"
"1268840","1270520"," to capture that correction."
"1270520","1276000"," So even if you get that correction now or if you get it in late September."
"1276700","1280500"," It's still not the market crash trade. "
"1280500","1285340"," It's just a corrective trade with put spreads into the end of September."
"1285340","1288640"," That's an expected, uh, pullback in the marketplace."
"1289660","1296420"," So just be aware of where you actually are, what the trade, what that trade actually is, uh,"
"1296580","1299280"," versus, yeah, we're going to zero because what happens is. "
"1299720","1306440"," What happens is we get the pullback and these, these market crash bears, they disappear."
"1307520","1309560"," They're not actually trading market crash."
"1309940","1310720"," This is the top. "
"1311140","1316800"," They're telling you that it is to change your sentiment to get price to where it needs to be for"
"1316800","1319140"," them to actually exit the market where they are."
"1319980","1322860"," Uh, meanwhile, you're like, you like sold out your lungs."
"1323160","1325700"," You sold out your underlying and your max short. "
"1325840","1331220"," And as we head down to those, uh, bottoms on the daily trigger on the weekly trigger, you're still"
"1331220","1332620"," max short, right?"
"1333380","1334600"," You're still like in shorts."
"1334600","1335880"," You're still inputs."
"1336700","1339620"," There's six months a year out and then you play your account up. "
"1340600","1341540"," Happens all the time."
"1341720","1343640"," Happens when the market's going down as well."
"1344560","1348060"," It actually happens when the market's rolling over all the time. "
"1353260","1354820"," We go back over to the vade screen."
"1363080","1366560"," So I had some, I had some Friday calls in here in that same position."
"1367540","1371100"," Uh, I was not in, uh, one dates or zero dates in the overnight. "
"1371360","1372660"," I don't know if any of you were or not."
"1374160","1378600"," Now, but I do have Friday calls and I also own some, uh, TMF."
"1378880","1388260"," So I'll tell you what, the drama out there is bizarre. "
"1389120","1392500"," Uh, some of this shit that I was reading, I was not reading watching."
"1393000","1394840"," Well, I didn't watch the actual videos."
"1395120","1399020"," I just watched all the, uh, shouldn't say I watched because I didn't. "
"1399140","1401140"," What I did was I was scrolling through trying to watch."
"1401800","1402780"," I'm looking for a sailboat."
"1402940","1405440"," I'm like trying to kind of look for these sailboat videos. "
"1405440","1407640"," And there's not a ton of them out on YouTube."
"1408160","1411360"," So they recommend stuff that's on my feet or whatever."
"1412720","1414160"," I'm like, these people are insane. "
"1415160","1420660"," I'm like, these, these fucking people have been calling tops 12 times this year."
"1422000","1424080"," 12 times they've called tops 12."
"1425360","1426780"," Uh, it's just bizarre. "
"1427740","1429700"," Like, I gotta, I have to be honest with you."
"1430200","1432340"," Like, I gotta be honest with you."
"1433060","1438760"," Anyone that called 12 tops this year, uh, is either lying to you. "
"1440440","1444620"," They're either lying to you in what they're trading or they're working a job."
"1445140","1447980"," They either have a fucking job that they go to every week."
"1448480","1450660"," I'm gonna be fucking 100% honest with you. "
"1451020","1452060"," I don't like telling this publicly."
"1452300","1453280"," I'm gonna tell you something publicly."
"1454560","1459940"," These people that are telling you that that's the top have probably called the top 10 times this"
"1459940","1460760"," year, 12 times. "
"1460760","1461560"," 11."
"1461880","1462240"," This is 12."
"1463160","1469840"," These are probably the same people that were telling you we were gonna crash in May and June, uh,"
"1470220","1474800"," in October, in December, in March, in January. "
"1475560","1477360"," Not even like, hey, we're at risk of this."
"1478040","1478960"," Just that we are."
"1479820","1484800"," So if I have to guess here, these same people are trading a paycheck. "
"1485660","1487260"," Um, I don't know if they're trading."
"1488080","1491480"," I don't know, whatever they're trading, but the 12 times they've called it."
"1491720","1493120"," Can you just imagine, right?"
"1493580","1496440"," Can you imagine listening to these people?"
"1497480","1499840"," And they're telling you this is the top, right?"
"1500220","1502980"," They told us this the entire way from October to here. "
"1504280","1504760"," Right?"
"1505020","1506080"," They told you this was the top."
"1506380","1514220"," Now, let's just say that they told you this is the top and they sold the market because I bought"
"1514220","1514840"," the market."
"1514840","1521400"," So I'm wondering here how they sold the market 12 fucking times. "
"1521980","1522680"," Who are they?"
"1522820","1523500"," Fucking Mike Barry?"
"1523840","1524340"," What do they do?"
"1524720","1529880"," These people have fucking like, uh, Uncle Bob, they can call up and I need a hundred fucking"
"1529880","1530180"," millions."
"1530540","1531380"," They can eventually be right."
"1531960","1533680"," Get the fuck out of here. "
"1535120","1538080"," Get the fuck out of here that you're doing that."
"1538860","1541580"," Well, you think you got a special relationship with your broker?"
"1542940","1544120"," So I don't know."
"1544420","1545660"," I'm trying to figure this out. "
"1545980","1550780"," I've had all kinds of excuses given to me how like, well, it went down."
"1551020","1554900"," I was up and then as soon as it came back up, I cut it loose."
"1555440","1557960"," I'm like, what even been broke since fucking October then?"
"1558820","1559640"," You're just flat. "
"1559900","1560900"," You just going short."
"1562100","1562660"," What do you do?"
"1562760","1565720"," You go to go public and say, this is the top."
"1566500","1570360"," You take your short and then it comes back up to a certain point and then you cut it loose. "
"1570360","1572100"," And you don't make any money."
"1572260","1572640"," What are you doing?"
"1572680","1574820"," You pay and just rent since October."
"1575840","1578560"," They pay and just rent since last May or June. "
"1579320","1580040"," Get out of here."
"1580260","1583360"," So this has nothing to do with a seller."
"1583780","1586780"," This has to do with the Derm seller. "
"1588200","1590860"," The purporting of this is the top."
"1591480","1596000"," So you have to understand where that person is coming from."
"1596460","1598600"," So that person is only one of two people. "
"1598600","1605520"," They're either selling you fucking bullshit to get their shit to print, right?"
"1605860","1606560"," Where they disappear."
"1607120","1608900"," They break out that little smoke bomb."
"1610340","1611760"," Take the money and run. "
"1613680","1614240"," Right?"
"1615340","1619200"," Meanwhile, you're drinking the Kool-Aid and you're like, yeah, you're here."
"1619300","1619920"," We're going to zero."
"1620940","1621220"," Right?"
"1621640","1622240"," See, you hear that. "
"1623960","1624520"," Right?"
"1625060","1625680"," I'm back short."
"1626160","1633140"," And then you get to keep your job all they disappear or that person is actually max fucking short."
"1633580","1635680"," And they got a goddamn job at Wendy's. "
"1636360","1637580"," That's what they got a job at Wendy's."
"1637860","1638280"," I don't care."
"1638440","1640460"," You can name it wherever they don't care where they have a job. "
"1640640","1646060"," But they're saving up their thousand dollar paychecks and they're max short and it over and over"
"1646060","1646640"," and over."
"1649040","1652720"," Because I don't know."
"1652840","1654520"," This market goes up in my view. "
"1654520","1656120"," This market goes up historically."
"1657460","1658720"," This market goes up."
"1659780","1662020"," And you should be looking for dips to buy here. "
"1662400","1664960"," You should be looking for dips to buy right here on that daily trigger."
"1665420","1670240"," You should be looking for dips to buy on that weekly trigger if it comes with some time on it."
"1670860","1676080"," So you can look at that fucking thumbnail that I got in this video that tells you that the max"
"1676080","1677480"," performers are here. "
"1679400","1680280"," Not the weekends."
"1681680","1683680"," We're the people that see through the bullshit."
"1685960","1688860"," We're the ones that are trying to say no, no, no, no, no. "
"1688880","1689800"," Listen, these people."
"1690300","1691700"," They're out of their fucking minds."
"1692660","1696920"," If they think that we're going to go back to all time highs and just fail. "
"1698340","1700100"," Let's look at that for a minute, too."
"1703280","1704960"," Let's take a look at that for a minute."
"1708450","1710830"," Let's talk about how out of your mind you sound. "
"1713600","1714840"," Let's look at that for a minute."
"1715300","1716840"," I mean, let's look at where we are."
"1721820","1725620"," I mean, we just got back here to 4.59, right?"
"1726140","1726800"," I mean, let's look at this. "
"1727280","1730280"," It's got back here to 4.59, 59."
"1730800","1734140"," We're trading right here in its market crash."
"1734860","1735580"," You get what I'm saying?"
"1735720","1736460"," It's like, really?"
"1738220","1739260"," And why is this significant?"
"1742060","1743340"," Let's ask that question, too. "
"1745700","1748000"," Let's ask, why is that significant?"
"1749500","1750900"," Let's make that one a big red."
"1751520","1752340"," Let's find out."
"1752560","1753920"," Let's go back and hit time. "
"1755720","1757140"," And let's take a look at it."
"1761950","1762710"," Let's go back there."
"1762830","1764850"," Let's have a look back in here. "
"1764950","1766430"," Nobody wants to go back in history, right?"
"1767330","1768590"," Look at all that stuff back there."
"1770710","1772370"," Let's talk about a messy ass chart."
"1775380","1777760"," You got this stinky Pete right here. "
"1777920","1778260"," Look at him."
"1780410","1784630"," We got this stinky Pete right here trying to sell you down, right?"
"1786740","1787800"," Look at that stinky Pete."
"1787900","1788440"," He's right there. "
"1789660","1792160"," He's like, you're going to fail to get that new high right here."
"1792220","1793920"," Yeah, we know every all the whole way up."
"1793920","1795260"," We failed that new high, right?"
"1796400","1798240"," The whole way up. "
"1798400","1800840"," We failed that new high, right?"
"1804550","1804590"," Boom."
"1804850","1805430"," Filled the new high."
"1805630","1806750"," Bring it back down here. "
"1806870","1811690"," We have 4.47, 4.46 down here, 450 over here."
"1812150","1814130"," Close the gap over here, right?"
"1815030","1818190"," Look at that, 4.49.05 fighting in here."
"1819730","1823670"," Get some pushers back over here, some buyers over here. "
"1823770","1825090"," You got cotton trapped down in here."
"1825630","1827110"," Kinds of volatility down in here."
"1827850","1829270"," Giant gap over here. "
"1830130","1831790"," Filling that gap in over here."
"1833010","1834870"," Filling all that in right now."
"1835910","1837210"," Daily triggers all over here. "
"1837390","1839830"," Just filling all this in right now."
"1839950","1840310"," You see it?"
"1840310","1842910"," Get all getting ground up and filled in right now."
"1844010","1844450"," Why?"
"1845810","1846250"," Why?"
"1847530","1848690"," Why, why, why?"
"1849010","1850270"," Because there's another gap up here. "
"1851350","1853650"," What do you think we're leaving this one behind right here?"
"1853710","1855090"," You think we're leaving that gap behind?"
"1855570","1856690"," Is that what you really think?"
"1857610","1858330"," What is that?"
"1859250","1860470"," 466, 44."
"1863580","1864720"," 466, 44."
"1865220","1866420"," Here's the previous high up here. "
"1868920","1870300"," You think we're leaving that gap behind?"
"1870460","1871700"," We go, come all the way up here."
"1873360","1875240"," We're not going to fill this one in at least."
"1875800","1877740"," We get a lot of work to get there, don't we?"
"1878280","1880400"," We get some filling in to do down here. "
"1881160","1882720"," Just spend some time down here."
"1883240","1884880"," Fill all this in in here."
"1886540","1887500"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1890100","1893240"," Get all this back here that you're trying to fill in. "
"1893460","1896400"," Come back up here and start attacking this 466."
"1896980","1898840"," This 468, 469."
"1900280","1901720"," Even higher highs, believe it or not. "
"1903440","1903880"," 472."
"1906040","1907280"," We're not even here yet."
"1907660","1908640"," We're not even up here. "
"1909460","1912380"," We're not even at 466, 60 points away."
"1913380","1916120"," Fill in a gap and you're telling me we're not going back up there right now?"
"1916760","1917280"," Doom and gloom."
"1917880","1918260"," See you later. "
"1918380","1919460"," We're never coming back here again."
"1922260","1924340"," This market goes down to the right."
"1933880","1935840"," I'm over here trying to sell all this down. "
"1936400","1938000"," Sell a rage over here."
"1939620","1943480"," Big banks from back in the back of the beginning of 2022."
"1945240","1948820"," I wonder what kind of shorts are on still on the market, believe it or not. "
"1950280","1952540"," We're still not shorts on the market from back there."
"1952620","1953600"," Captain, like this, there is."
"1955260","1956280"," Yes, there is. "
"1956580","1958860"," Carl, I can just got taken for a bunch of money."
"1959560","1961080"," These guys don't give up."
"1964340","1965580"," It's not how it happens. "
"1969890","1972050"," Sitting here watching the daily trigger right now."
"1972470","1976390"," A little bit of a secondary bloodbath setting up."
"1976890","1980350"," You get the first, you get the first beer plane right here. "
"1980890","1984530"," These second ones can be a doozy down here, so I'm going to pay attention to this."
"1989990","1992030"," TMFs going back down again right now."
"1993230","1995670"," TMF was cranking now with a pullback on TMF. "
"1996810","1997530"," I think that one second."
"2015650","2016850"," A bunch of drama."
"2017270","2019450"," A bunch of drama queens out there. "
"2021950","2024270"," I mean, we're up here in streams sometimes, right?"
"2024850","2026250"," We're just blasting north."
"2027430","2029170"," And we'll be on like a high, right?"
"2029510","2032750"," And I get asked in chat, like, should I enter along now?"
"2032970","2034330"," And I'm like, are you out of your minds?"
"2035050","2038610"," Like, when you're on these bottoms, you add two long positions."
"2039330","2040730"," You create long positions. "
"2041650","2045890"," If anything, you would be buying long positions right where we are in the daily trigger."
"2046610","2051989"," And if we were then to roll down to the weekly, you would roll into that long."
"2052830","2053330"," Does that make sense?"
"2054250","2061150"," So your job as a bull or as a buyer is to be buying these pullbacks. "
"2061710","2069449"," Your job is not to be watching the stock market go to 466 and saying, I want to add here,"
"2069510","2069889"," Captain."
"2070310","2071250"," You know, you don't do that."
"2071710","2074469"," You actually put the risk on down on daily triggers. "
"2075370","2081790"," If you lose, or if you didn't put enough time on it, if you lose, you roll into the weekly"
"2081790","2082230"," trigger."
"2083310","2088590"," Now, if you put enough time on it, it's not really going to matter if we even go to the"
"2088590","2089250"," weekly trigger."
"2089250","2090469"," Is it going to go higher?"
"2091130","2092330"," This market goes up. "
"2092469","2094389"," I want you to remember that at all times."
"2095030","2096570"," This market goes up."
"2096650","2097790"," It does not go down. "
"2098070","2101210"," It is not easy to crash the S&P 500."
"2102310","2106650"," Fucking point in case was 2022 and 2021."
"2107390","2109890"," We continued higher for an entire year. "
"2111370","2114990"," In 2021, I remember that year."
"2115610","2120530"," And I fucking remember every bear out there that year for an entire year."
"2121610","2126770"," Claim this market was going down and the S&P 500 is going to crash. "
"2127170","2129010"," And then we got a rollover last year."
"2129810","2130170"," Right?"
"2130370","2131390"," We got a rollover last year."
"2131750","2135050"," And I was told that every one of those bottoms, we're going to crash down. "
"2135050","2137530"," And now we're not even like, what?"
"2137630","2138010"," What are we?"
"2138170","2138930"," 70 points?"
"2139250","2140070"," What have 448?"
"2141330","2142270"," We're like, what?"
"2142550","2145110"," From 466 is like right down the road."
"2145850","2148070"," And you're trying to tell me that we're not going there."
"2148390","2149630"," You're out of your fucking mind. "
"2150250","2151250"," You really are."
"2151330","2152330"," You're out of your fucking mind."
"2154570","2155990"," You're out of your mind. "
"2157630","2160710"," Tell me after you couldn't crash this shit in 2022."
"2161470","2166530"," After this thing mooned in 2021 at the S&P 500."
"2166630","2168190"," That's the top we're going to zero. "
"2168570","2169750"," Yeah, I'm a fucking face."
"2171950","2176810"," We might go to zero, but you're crazy."
"2177250","2178690"," You're literally crazy, man. "
"2179630","2181470"," People buy this thing for life."
"2182750","2185470"," Like they like they own it for life till they're 80."
"2194160","2198160"," It's like happening today. "
"2200550","2201710"," I'll give it happening."
"2202030","2204910"," Like I'm not anti like the market rolling over."
"2205510","2207590"," Has I think in my or my view. "
"2209050","2210610"," It happens once."
"2211130","2215150"," It happens slightly after the pause comes in."
"2216190","2218410"," Or the or the pause is believed. "
"2219370","2222670"," To be coming once sentiments goes to."
"2223410","2226570"," Yeah, we have a pause the next meeting."
"2226850","2228310"," We're going to get a pause. "
"2229930","2234230"," In everyone believes that we are going to start to cut rates."
"2235250","2236510"," When that happens."
"2237490","2238850"," That's when my countdown starts. "
"2238890","2239590"," I'm like countdown."
"2241510","2243950"," Well, and I still haven't seen a matter of fact."
"2244070","2244650"," I just read a story. "
"2244810","2245670"," I did read this story."
"2246370","2249450"," They were like the most credit card debt in history."
"2250150","2251450"," Or something like that. "
"2252130","2254990"," And they made the CNN made all the spooky sounds on it."
"2255050","2256530"," And I was like, man, it's not up that much."
"2257450","2259790"," Was it's up a little bit in the last report. "
"2259790","2260750"," I'm like, it's not."
"2261070","2262410"," It's not that bad yet."
"2264720","2265720"," Then I read someone else. "
"2265960","2268620"," And then some other rocket scientists came into it."
"2268800","2271680"," To a discussion board I was on."
"2272260","2274380"," And he was talking about commercial real estate. "
"2275140","2276200"," Saying that's the."
"2278260","2280100"," That's where the risk to the market is."
"2280340","2282920"," And I'm like the risk isn't there to that market. "
"2283760","2285680"," I was like, what happens is."
"2285680","2288160"," I was like, this is so bizarre."
"2288880","2291120"," This is very much similar to. "
"2293180","2295020"," 2007 2008."
"2297320","2299480"," With auto loans."
"2299880","2302820"," So auto loans in the 2007 2008. "
"2304020","2305360"," Is very similar to."
"2306760","2309240"," Commercial real estate loans."
"2310200","2313840"," In that these people can abandon. "
"2314420","2315160"," These loans."
"2316460","2318740"," And right now they can sell still, right?"
"2318820","2320480"," Even with a balloon payment, they can still sell."
"2321840","2323640"," And they don't really care, right?"
"2323800","2325740"," These banks can absorb this kind of stuff. "
"2326560","2328540"," And catch a bill out, believe it or not."
"2329160","2330540"," Catch an actual bill out."
"2330700","2332860"," We already have seen the fed support of. "
"2333140","2335580"," A regional banks earlier in the year."
"2335960","2338700"," When you expect them to step right back in on that as well."
"2339280","2342260"," And be supportive of banks. "
"2342260","2346400"," If there is an implosion of the commercial banking market."
"2348480","2351820"," I don't think that's where the the risk comes in."
"2352020","2353900"," I think that the risk comes into. "
"2354800","2358940"," A wealthy bank or hedge fund that's been short this fucking market."
"2359140","2360220"," I think they're going to get rolled over."
"2360560","2362040"," I think they're going to get rolled hard. "
"2362580","2364440"," I can I think was the tip of the iceberg."
"2365420","2366820"," I don't think that's over."
"2367140","2369020"," I think that's the one that comes back to haunt. "
"2369020","2371980"," And that might be a signal."
"2372140","2376060"," But the but but in truth with the things that I'm actually looking for like the actual."
"2376440","2377300"," What do I want to see?"
"2377660","2380840"," I want to see the belief that we've caused rates. "
"2381600","2383560"," The belief that we're going to cut rates."
"2384060","2387380"," I want to see that unemployment rate coming up steeply."
"2388060","2389200"," I want to see. "
"2390620","2394220"," Jobs going down right the availability of jobs out there."
"2394240","2395520"," I want to see those coming down."
"2396900","2400280"," Those are some big things that really means something jobs unemployment. "
"2401300","2404800"," And then the cutting of rates for even that big role to happen."
"2405620","2409300"," And you know this like you're going to get this talk right now."
"2409480","2410860"," We did this video two weeks ago. "
"2411760","2415280"," Two weeks ago I did a video and I was like you're going to get every fucking bear out there"
"2415280","2416640"," coming out and saying that's the top."
"2417040","2420860"," You're going to get every fucking famous bear telling you this is the top."
"2421440","2423060"," They're going to try to front run this. "
"2423060","2424520"," They're going to come in early."
"2425520","2426840"," They come out of their holes."
"2427100","2430000"," They're once a month or so and they tell you that's the top and now they're going to come out"
"2430000","2431940"," early and get the game faces on. "
"2432360","2438600"," And they're going to try to shift sentiments to negativity right from now into whenever we do get"
"2438600","2439340"," the actual top."
"2439640","2446340"," And what's even more insane is if this was a top you still have time to exit the market."
"2446580","2449520"," So it's not like you can't exit the market. "
"2449520","2451580"," It's not like we don't return to this scene."
"2451720","2453140"," And what's even more fascinating."
"2453560","2458060"," I was trying to go through this for myself this week and I was like yeah, let's say it is"
"2458060","2458420"," the top. "
"2459120","2461400"," Let's say let's entertain them."
"2462540","2464280"," Let's entertain them and say it's the top."
"2464980","2466600"," Let's say they're going to bread run it early. "
"2467000","2468880"," Let's say they're going to front run it extremely early."
"2469080","2469560"," Hold on a second here."
"2473760","2476160"," Let's say they're on time here. "
"2476160","2483540"," I'm going to say even if we get that check back down there right even if they check that shit"
"2483540","2484860"," down there and when they do."
"2485980","2487240"," Check that stuff down there."
"2487300","2490800"," It's usually like a month and a half of pain month and a half. "
"2491620","2492500"," Sometimes three."
"2493360","2493800"," Max."
"2495100","2495700"," That's it. "
"2496380","2497380"," You can close your laptop."
"2498480","2502900"," Open it back up in a month and a half three months and the sun's going to be shining."
"2503940","2504880"," Everything's going to be happy. "
"2505140","2508920"," The birds will be chirping and you're still going up."
"2509400","2510880"," It's going to be the quickest."
"2511540","2513900"," You're not getting like nine months of down. "
"2514160","2516880"," You're not getting six months of down."
"2517100","2517800"," You're not getting."
"2519360","2523580"," Sector full sector cuts and then the S&P 500 down for three years. "
"2524060","2526280"," It doesn't happen like that in these situations."
"2527160","2529660"," Really going to do that cup and handle go up there and slap some new highs."
"2530480","2532740"," Or if we roll down and test the trough. "
"2533060","2533700"," It's fast."
"2533780","2534580"," Every time."
"2534720","2537400"," It's like way I'm down way I'm back up. "
"2538240","2541840"," So you're at the tail end of this cycle."
"2542240","2543700"," We're not the start of this cycle."
"2543700","2544240"," I'm sorry. "
"2544440","2546140"," I apologize to you if you're a seller out there."
"2546380","2549480"," If it went anyway shape or form you think that we're in the beginning of it."
"2549800","2550980"," You're out of your fucking mind. "
"2551780","2554180"," The beginning of it was December of 2020."
"2555220","2559860"," So you're like all the threats and all of the noise."
"2560920","2564400"," And the doom and gloom is we're passing it. "
"2565220","2566180"," You got him saying."
"2567740","2569380"," Passing by the."
"2570100","2572100"," The real danger and risk. "
"2572100","2573920"," We're actually entering into."
"2574380","2575700"," Hey, you bought the dip in October."
"2576320","2577640"," Did you buy the dip last June?"
"2577840","2578260"," Good job. "
"2578560","2579660"," Did you buy the dip in October?"
"2580100","2580600"," Good job."
"2580740","2584160"," Did you buy the dip in the summer?"
"2584160","2584400"," Good job."
"2585520","2588140"," And I want you to know that any rollover if there is any. "
"2588300","2589200"," It's going to come right back up."
"2590780","2593260"," We don't get multi year bear markets."
"2593640","2594680"," That's not how this works. "
"2595080","2596240"," Never has worked like that."
"2596320","2596700"," Well, it has."
"2597120","2598860"," It's been a couple of times that's worked like that. "
"2600140","2601340"," Yeah, World War II."
"2602060","2602960"," Work like that."
"2604080","2605060"," The Great Depression. "
"2605380","2606240"," Yeah, it worked like that."
"2607520","2609500"," Do you think do I think you're getting that again?"
"2610920","2612840"," No, no, I don't think so."
"2613860","2615680"," Do I think we have fraud in the market?"
"2615820","2618520"," The same guy was not the same guy was talking. "
"2618740","2621460"," He was like commercial real estate market is a fraud."
"2622240","2623520"," And I was like, what do you mean?"
"2623700","2624560"," It's a fucking fraud."
"2625020","2626740"," I was like, get out of here with it. "
"2626740","2627120"," It's a fraud."
"2629240","2630600"," Seriously, get out of here with it."
"2630640","2630980"," It's a fraud. "
"2631540","2632700"," It's a killing me."
"2634060","2634840"," It's a fraud."
"2635100","2635680"," It's one more fraud. "
"2636020","2636240"," I'm like."
"2637420","2639540"," So markets are fraud built upon."
"2640160","2642720"," You know, two, three hundred years. "
"2644580","2645420"," Of fraud."
"2650180","2653200"," Back to the argument about burning tires in New York."
"2655220","2657320"," The U.S. is going to lose the dollar. "
"2658640","2659660"," I kid you not."
"2659800","2660460"," Sounds in the army."
"2661860","2665280"," Like, man, unless you're like a war correspondent or. "
"2666280","2667860"," You've worked for like."
"2669700","2672860"," Some kind of NGO or some of some kind."
"2673800","2677160"," I'm not maybe travel, not to resort. "
"2678320","2679520"," Outside of the country."
"2679760","2681020"," If you like actually travel."
"2682100","2683540"," You know, the kind of traveling. "
"2683700","2685620"," Most people think that they do, but they don't."
"2687280","2694560"," You then understand the hegemony of the U.S. It's very rare to understand this true scope."
"2695560","2698200"," In breadth of U.S. hegemony in the world. "
"2698500","2699740"," It's not to be fucked with."
"2701180","2704480"," I know that pisses people off, but it's the truth."
"2705940","2708960"," Did you saw people saying like they're like U.S. lost this war?"
"2709780","2710620"," Like, no, they didn't. "
"2710800","2713160"," They had that war as long as they wanted to have it."
"2715600","2717620"," You don't want to call us like a hyper power."
"2717980","2718960"," So you got super powers. "
"2719520","2721800"," You got the U.S. they're a hyper power."
"2722920","2725520"," Replace the dollar with the fuck out of here."
"2727760","2729380"," It takes so much for that to happen. "
"2730600","2733160"," Well, maybe the blow up like the Panama Canal or something."
"2740700","2742220"," Burning tires in New York."
"2743460","2744460"," The Great Depression. "
"2745460","2746320"," We haven't seen nothing."
"2746460","2747260"," We're going to see another one."
"2747360","2748200"," The worst one ever. "
"2748500","2749360"," I'm like, no, we're not."
"2749680","2751100"," We're never seeing that ever again."
"2752100","2753320"," Or if you saw that. "
"2753920","2755440"," I think Joe Donut and I talk about it."
"2755440","2760400"," We were like, it's the, it's the nuclear question, right?"
"2760640","2761380"," With the stock market."
"2762920","2767480"," It's like that question is, if we're ever going to go that to that place. "
"2769220","2771300"," Then you might as well buy the bottom, right?"
"2771860","2773740"," So like if we have that moment."
"2775020","2779900"," If you ever have that like that doom and gloom that everybody talks about."
"2779900","2781480"," There's nothing else to do. "
"2782280","2783740"," But buy it, right?"
"2783740","2785540"," There would be, there's no other points."
"2787020","2789840"," Part of that had to do with the 87 crash too, right?"
"2790060","2792440"," There was like, hey, there's no market with the great one."
"2793280","2794400"," As that was happening. "
"2796200","2798400"," And that's what you turn to your partner and you go."
"2799760","2801100"," No one wants to buy this shit."
"2801180","2802600"," We should definitely buy it here, right?"
"2805520","2806600"," Because if it's going lower. "
"2808080","2810460"," You know, it's not, you know, you're going to be broke anyways."
"2810860","2811240"," What do you care?"
"2817640","2819400"," Still trading the daily trigger."
"2821360","2823780"," Daily trigger will not give it up right now. "
"2824100","2825660"," Getting a little bit of flattening right now."

"4017980","4019140"," Holding up just fine. "
"4030940","4032520"," Let me read your chat right now."
"4032660","4034540"," Jimmy Berry saying, I have said this before."
"4034760","4035960"," The bullshit inflation decreased. "
"4036340","4038780"," The Fed keeps talking about isn't happening."
"4038780","4041380"," And wait rates will drive property prices down."
"4041900","4043500"," That'll be the top of the market. "
"4043500","4044840"," But for now for 50."
"4046620","4048160"," You know, Jimmy, I was."
"4048660","4050660"," So I went looking at properties. "
"4052040","4052660"," Yesterday."
"4055380","4057160"," And I was."
"4057860","4059580"," I was shocked. "
"4061360","4063280"," There's one house I was looking at."
"4064300","4065620"," It was in."
"4066480","4069380"," I think this one was in California. "
"4071420","4072020"," And."
"4073200","4079120"," The last time it sold was 2012 or something like that."
"4079840","4082600"," I think it's sold for 70 grand. "
"4083780","4086320"," 66 or 70,000."
"4087820","4096100"," And it's now listed for $3.99. And I was like, you got to be fucking kidding me."
"4098270","4100810"," It was like, it was like 60 something. "
"4101130","4103250"," And this house was not looking pretty."
"4104729","4107189"," And it was just, they had a price decrease."
"4108569","4110149"," I think a hundred grand or something. "
"4113370","4114970"," I was like, you got to be kidding me."
"4116270","4118569"," So I went looking at houses yesterday."
"4121130","4121710"," I got no choice. "
"4121970","4122149"," I'm like."
"4123609","4127069"," I got to take a look around and see what's going on."
"4128830","4131910"," Some of the absurd requests are. "
"4132410","4136290"," Some of the some of some of like, because I don't think the housing markets coming down."
"4137670","4139330"," I don't think it's coming down."
"4140069","4142490"," But I'm like, how the fuck do they get it down?"
"4143830","4145450"," Like, you got to do something. "
"4145770","4146870"," Like they got to do something."
"4148310","4150729"," We need to need more house loan, home loan."
"4151689","4153029"," Tightening, like specific. "
"4160020","4161040"," I'm shocked, man."
"4161240","4165080"," Some of the prices that I'm looking at right now, I'm like, these people are out of their fucking"
"4165080","4165479"," minds."
"4166760","4168160"," Like, they're out of their minds. "
"4169340","4170580"," Out of their minds."
"4171020","4172160"," Like, I can understand."
"4173140","4174180"," There's like two parts of this. "
"4174460","4182479"," Like, there's like two, you got like, grade A, grade B, grade C properties."
"4185460","4191040"," It's a really weird thing because like, some people are like, I want to buy a grade A property or"
"4191040","4192080"," something that's ready to go."
"4194220","4196920"," And my view on it is like, why would you ever do that?"
"4196920","4198800"," Why wouldn't you just pay to have it done yourself?"
"4201590","4205530"," Like, as a seller, it's really, it's a really weird thing. "
"4207230","4216550"," Like, as a seller, it's, as a seller, it's, it's a, oh, look at, look at all the drama here."
"4217130","4218970"," 44722, new low right now."
"4219550","4221270"," We are getting that last roll down. "
"4221270","4228610"," They are bringing NDX down a blast through that 15, 1, 19, trading 447, 14 right now."
"4229090","4234950"," It's like, it's like some, I'm watching these houses yesterday and I'm like, I'm looking at all"
"4234950","4243570"," these houses and I'm like, man, I'm like, usually you'll get someone that renovates a house and"
"4243570","4248650"," they try to sell the house based on that renovation, right?"
"4248650","4250790"," So you get like the markup on the house."
"4251070","4252870"," It's a great A, great B property. "
"4254230","4261450"," You're relying upon, thing that always makes, or is bizarre to me is that, um, it's dated the"
"4261450","4265790"," moment that it's put in and then you don't, it might not be what you like or what you actually"
"4265790","4266130"," want."
"4266710","4270390"," So why wouldn't you just buy a house and renovate everything yourself as it is?"
"4270990","4272910"," Trading 44700 right now."
"4273870","4275370"," Damn it, I got to add again, dude. "
"4281370","4283930"," Nasdaq breaking down into the 15."
"4285290","4287370"," Now, what 11 down here?"
"4317320","4319200"," Sorry, I'm buying a bunch of calls down here."
"4322150","4327710"," So I'm looking at these houses yesterday and I'm like, normally I would expect, um, I would expect"
"4327710","4337430"," like the grade, D, E, F, even C properties to not be that priced in that price range. "
"4339690","4344890"," And, uh, so that you can, you can renovate these homes and make some money off them."
"4346330","4351230"," But these are like, I'm looking at houses that I'm like, there's no fucking way that if I had to"
"4351230","4358290"," buy this house for $300,000, $400,000, then I'm ever getting 567, uh, $100,000 off of them."
"4358790","4360990"," I can build a house, uh, for that money. "
"4361270","4366790"," I can raise that fucking house to the ground and build a house that's, um, beautiful."
"4368550","4370790"," Here I am down here trying to buy calls right now."
"4371090","4373070"," I should have, I should have stayed and putts down here. "
"4376850","4378410"," I'm down here trying to buy fucking calls."
"4379690","4382290"," There's S1 down here, 445, 78."
"4386150","4390470"," So I'm looking at these houses yesterday and I'm like, I'm like, you're not getting 400 for me. "
"4390770","4391770"," You're just not getting it."
"4393870","4402210"," Um, and there's like a class of houses, I guess like these class F E, uh, D and C houses"
"4402210","4404090"," where people are either fucking mines."
"4407960","4410040"," Got another buy set up down here. "
"4420310","4422170"," We have to add some of the money here."
"4422370","4424930"," I'm going to have to add some, uh, one here."
"4430120","4430600"," Okay. "
"4430740","4432700"," You're a fucking mind being down here at 445."
"4439810","4443350"," I'm going to add some in the money Friday calls here too, just as a hedge."
"4452940","4454800"," We got some 447s. "
"4454860","4455400"," I'm looking at here."

"4492470","4494830"," The previous low is right down here. "
"4506250","4507670"," That one just put a hurting on me."
"4507750","4509390"," I just put, I just spent a ton of money."
"4510750","4513430"," I just spent $20,000 on calls just then. "
"4514850","4516850"," 20 fucking K right on that bar."
"4518030","4519470"," I'm about to throw up on this trade."
"4521990","4525390"," $20,000 on weeklies on a Tuesday. "
"4540300","4542620"," So I'm here looking at houses yesterday, right?"
"4544400","4546560"," I'm not paying this money."
"4546720","4548540"," I looked at some ranches too."
"4557450","4560750"," I was actually looking for land, like 20 to 100 acres out west. "
"4568000","4572560"," I spent $23,000 in calls just there on that bar right here."

"4840530","4844790"," Apple though, the market down on its weekly trigger right now."
"4844970","4846570"," $3 more dollars to go for Apple."

"4939470","4940730"," I'm going to get stopped out of this trade."
"4940730","4941490"," Are you going to tell?"
"4944880","4948060"," I got my fucking hands on the fucking cell trigger here."
"4949000","4950580"," Fingers on the cell button. "
"4951900","5003400"," I already"
"5003400","5005180"," see that I'm going to get stopped out of this shit."
"5006460","5006940"," Yep."
"5006940","5026880"," I'm going to"
"5026880","5028260"," stop it on this trade. "
"5028500","5029600"," I just think a giant trade."
"5029800","5032520"," I'm down at $1,300, something like that."
"5033020","5035860"," Down to $20,900. "
"5037060","5038740"," Was that $23 when I bought it."
"5038740","5044300"," I got to stop on it right now."
"5044540","5045760"," Still haven't been stopped out yet. "
"5048740","5049300"," Sweatin'."

"5356120","5357160"," They are trying here."
"5377400","5379140"," Still not stopped out."
"5379520","5380680"," They are trying though. "
"5383630","5385470"," They were like scraping the twos."
"5385550","5386670"," They were like 206, 206."
"5387190","5387750"," I want to sell 207. "
"5389050","5389590"," I want 204."
"5390070","5390650"," You want to sell that?"

"5576760","5577040"," 53."
"5582640","5583160"," 448. "
"5585580","5588440"," Right there."
"5654600","5656380"," Just so you know I'm trying to trade this right here."
"5677720","5679620"," I bought this tick right here. "
"5682340","5685040"," What I don't want to see is this to roll over here."
"5685120","5686440"," I need to see this trade here."
"5694880","5696660"," NDX sitting on its 30 EMA. "
"5697240","5698560"," I'm going to five minute chart right now."
"5698680","5699120"," One minute chart."
"5699300","5699620"," Excuse me. "
"5709650","5710890"," I'm flat right now."
"5732870","5734770"," Any kind of continuation here."
"5734830","5736350"," I'm going to have to flip this to selling. "
"5736350","5738970"," So this is not like right here."
"5740870","5743950"," This would, if any kind of rejection here is not going to be good."
"5744790","5747530"," It's like the key for me here is to break above this. "
"5758800","5764730"," Need to break above 446.42. Green now."
"5796570","5799190"," Vicks trading 16.55 right now."
"5800090","5800830"," Here's man. "
"5800970","5803010"," They want to roll this so hard right now."
"5803270","5828340"," Vicks trading that"
"5828340","5831600"," 16.62. That was the upside target."
"5831940","5839780"," Next targets on Vicks to the upside would be 17.32 and then 18.14. We're just below it. "
"5840760","5844200"," We also got 18.41 up there from the other day."
"5844660","5846200"," That was left behind as well."
"5870840","5873360"," Nasdaq breaking above its 30 EMA right now. "
"5878230","5881910"," That 15.119. Just adds up here."
"5882050","5885170"," So like that 15.119 number from Nasdaq earlier."
"5886410","5888990"," It's going to, they're going to try to turn that into resistance here. "
"5889090","5891890"," That's why you're seeing this weakness right now on spy."
"5892570","5894490"," Just where we are right here."
"5896390","5898010"," On spoons specifically. "
"5898850","5908630"," So Nasdaq is trying to climb above 15.119. And it's above its 30 EMA."
"5908950","5913450"," But as it's coming back up there, there's now turning support into resistance here."
"5914310","5916830"," On Nasdaq right in this zone right here. "
"5916930","5918170"," So we got to break above this."
"5919170","5922730"," Don't want to turn this into resistance or we're going to bloodbath this market."
"5923010","5924550"," So we'll see what's up. "
"5928540","5930880"," Trading 16.60 on Vicks right now."
"5934580","5945040"," So the target on Vicks was 16.62. Next target on Vicks above is 17.32. For"
"5945040","5948080"," some reason I can't put lines on my charts right here."
"5948800","5974510"," 18.13 and 18.41. Don't"
"5974510","5975930"," like seeing this right here. "
"5975930","5977110"," Pretty bearish right here too."
"5977370","5979010"," Just seeing this rejection bar right here."
"5979210","5979490"," Not good. "
"5983220","5985060"," So just watching this right here."
"5991160","5993020"," Having problems putting stuff on this."
"5996240","5998500"," Sellers are real in there right here so. "
"6000200","6003760"," Still haven't triggered a sell so we'll find out if I did get triggered out of this trade."
"6004540","6005400"," I hope that I don't."
"6022770","6024330"," Previous low down here. "
"6024890","6029690"," So if you're a bear you want that previous low down here at 4.44. Although I think if you"
"6029690","6034510"," start to reject here you're going to get all the way down to at least that's too even more."
"6034970","6037150"," 442.80 won't be the target to get down there."
"6044390","6046530"," Still long substantial calls here. "
"6047070","6079750"," It was"
"6079750","6083110"," actually green for a minute in here on the last set of calls that I bought."
"6083350","6084210"," It was green right in here."
"6087140","6089600"," Briefly just a few hundred bucks not enough to make a difference. "
"6122620","6124340"," Dixie looking very bullish right now."
"6124860","6131840"," Pull back on Vicks right now but it's still looking for some kind of confirmation at $16 at $16."
"6133260","6135160"," Trading $16.40 right now. "
"6154700","6159040"," I'd have you looking pretty fucking bearish here and then Apple just floating around."
"6161620","6163400"," Apple with a bounce on $177."
"6164520","6168480"," The downside target on Apple was I believe $173 or $5. "
"6172460","6174280"," Tesla not showing the way down there yet either."
"6186540","6189200"," $174.44 total on Apple."
"6190600","6192140"," That's the exact number. "
"6202140","6204580"," Trading $177.36 right now."
"6204720","6206440"," So that kind of lends itself to that."
"6206900","6210260"," That capitulation move to the downside on spoons. "
"6210420","6211220"," That's what I'm afraid of."
"6212040","6213480"," It's like a fucking bloodbath."
"6214480","6216560"," It's shaping up right now for it. "
"6216580","6217400"," I'm going to get stopped out."
"6217520","6218160"," I can already see it."
"6222970","6225870"," It's already set itself up for a bloodbath right here. "
"6228090","6229070"," Still long calls."
"6241180","6242660"," You can see it right in here."
"6244940","6245960"," Previous low right here. "
"6246100","6247000"," Rejection right here."
"6247260","6247620"," Bounce around."
"6248040","6248420"," Bounce around. "
"6248420","6250720"," Get underneath here and then bam."
"6250840","6251340"," There's your downside."
"6251440","6252220"," New low. "
"6253280","6259800"," Price target down below $4.44.60. Still haven't been stopped out."
"6260380","6261040"," I don't know why."
"6261580","6262920"," I'm getting a premium kick right now. "
"6265870","6267510"," I'm getting premium kick on my calls."
"6268270","6270450"," My calls are going up as we're going down."
"6275180","6276280"," Just a heads up out there. "
"6277480","6281120"," My calls are rising in price on that low."
"6283910","6287190"," So this low my calls are actually going up."
"6298360","6299880"," They're selling puts down here. "
"6299900","6300840"," They're starting to."
"6306630","6308230"," Or someone's trying to sell puts."
"6313120","6314660"," Now I'm losing a little premium now. "
"6315080","6315620"," I'm getting closer."
"6336690","6339410"," I think I was at 06 down here or something like that."
"6341050","6345190"," Then that borrows at 09 or 12 or 12 or something like that. "
"6353040","6354820"," Or this red bar here was like 09."
"6355300","6355900"," That's when it was 12."
"6358300","6360700"," I've got a little bit more confidence here. "
"6379940","6381140"," I've got an IBM bloodbath and it's still."
"6383580","6393420"," HYG has a giant gap down to 74.23. It's got another gap down below it's"
"6393420","6398640"," 73.91.2. Dixie rolling over right now."
"6405540","6407700"," Now my calls are losing some shit down here. "
"6409260","6412100"," We're at 07.06 down here now."
"6491420","6493360"," And just like that they took me out of flat."
"6493880","6495120"," I'm flat on one large. "
"6495500","6495960"," I'm down."
"6496220","6499800"," I just lost three grand."
"6499800","6502420"," On that bar right there. "
"6502720","6503820"," $3,000 loss."
"6504860","6506660"," Right on that bar right there."
"6507460","6509560"," So you have $3,000 L on that loss. "
"6510700","6512220"," And I got stopped right here."
"6516690","6517590"," $3K dude."
"6517910","6546100"," This one"
"6546100","6546840"," right here got me. "
"6553630","6555510"," I was just under two on this one and it went."
"6555750","6556910"," Didn't catch me up here."
"6557050","6558070"," Didn't catch me over here. "
"6558950","6559290"," Bam."
"6559530","6560190"," That one caught me."
"6563410","6570590"," Yeah, three grand is not too much. "
"6574690","6575990"," Three grand is not."
"6576710","6577370"," Spend that."
"6577470","6578810"," I spent a thousand bucks in a day. "
"6584200","6585740"," Spend that in like a few days."
"6587700","6589260"," Spend that pissing money away."
"6591380","6593740"," Three fucking grand and I'm down on it. "
"6593780","6594660"," I got calls for Friday."
"6594920","6595740"," I got calls for Friday."
"6595740","6597940"," I got calls for Friday for 51s and 55 still. "
"6598440","6599200"," Haven't sold those."
"6599340","6600140"," Have added to them."
"6601540","6604660"," So I got 51s for Friday, 55s for Friday. "
"6606990","6609330"," I was trading 4.47s for Friday."
"6610630","6612270"," But that's not going to happen."
"6612630","6615550"," So we're going to wait and see until this cools off a little bit. "
"6616910","6618330"," Let them do their thing down here."
"6618470","6619810"," There's a lot of drama down here."
"6620030","6624290"," So let's let them do their drama down here trying to get their previous low. "
"6627130","6627790"," Fuck that."
"6627910","6629250"," I'm not giving three grand any bear."
"6634330","6636730"," Yeah, I'm just going to try to jump back in here in just a moment. "
"6636930","6646260"," So I kind of want to put a call spread on down here too."
"6646480","6651020"," So I'm thinking about apple call spreads down here."
"6651360","6654300"," So just as we get down here, try to reenter again. "
"6654380","6654660"," I'm going to go."
"6654740","6655980"," I'm going in with some size here."
"6656120","6663400"," So I'm going to end up being on some pretty big size down here. "
"6663400","6688410"," So wherever that here is, like"
"6688410","6692150"," part of me is like just by fucking apple fucking spreads right now."
"6693090","6694550"," It's trading $177."
"6695210","6697190"," Like do I need the other $3 on them?"
"6697690","6698970"," We're at a bottom down here. "
"6699030","6700090"," I just don't know where it is."
"6712640","6713920"," I mean, I know where it is."
"6714020","6714940"," It's generally in here. "
"6717370","6719470"," And they're killing options right now."
"6719970","6730910"," So the 4.47s are now $1.91. They"
"6730910","6735130"," might set up a spread here in the background and just hold this spread here."
"6735150","6735430"," Hold on. "
"6735550","6736170"," I got to log in."
"6815010","6815490"," 185."
"6817210","6819690"," Some logged in looking at apple call spreads here. "
"6837250","6837730"," Easy."
"6839030","6840010"," Wait for me, dude."
"6850120","6851060"," Back on again. "
"6852700","6855860"," Just bought a bunch more calls on 4.47 just then."
"6855860","6859140"," About a 100 pack of 4.47s. We'll see."
"6884380","6893540"," I'm looking at 9 on September 22nd apple call spread"
"6893540","6895160"," 170 to 200. "
"6897300","6899540"," I don't know that it gets the 200 though."
"6899960","6903600"," It costs $1,000 for $1,900."
"6916140","6920100"," It's like 170 to 190 call spread costs. "
"6922740","6925440"," 170 to 190 call spread costs."
"6926040","6927520"," It's not that good of a payout."
"6927820","6928780"," I'm going to get spy real quick. "
"6928940","6929140"," Hold on."
"6932930","6934730"," I don't like the payout on apple."
"6943840","6944900"," I think time for a second. "
"6945020","6945700"," I got some coming through."
"6958190","6959110"," Who is this?"
"6967620","6991760"," I keep getting like political September 22nd."
"6992600","7000080"," The pricing kind of sucks down here. "
"7021660","7028640"," So like it's $855 to make 1145 on spy."
"7030680","7034160"," Spreads for 922 for September 22nd."
"7035340","7036960"," That's not that good. "
"7037780","7038660"," It's kind of a shitty."
"7039380","7046040"," Kind of a shitty spread."
"7048320","7051360"," I'm only going to get paid 500 on that 800. "
"7051860","7052720"," 450 500."
"7054000","7056120"," And not only that, I have to go higher than."
"7058880","7059760"," I'm long again. "
"7059900","7061240"," I just put another 20k on."
"7062480","7063380"," Oh, not 20."
"7063640","7065480"," 19,000 or something like that. "
"7066620","7070780"," I was like went down to like $1.90 or something like that."
"7071100","7072180"," I put another 20."
"7072360","7073480"," I'm back in again. "
"7073480","7077500"," And I'm trying to buy some spreads right now for some size."
"7092900","7101560"," I've got a September 22nd debit call spreads 445 465 as"
"7101560","7103660"," well."
"7108710","7109750"," So I'm loading up right now. "
"7109910","7111310"," I'm putting money on right here."
"7111990","7113530"," Now we can get another leg down."
"7114470","7116190"," We can even get out here to 442. "
"7117690","7125430"," There's likely another downside move to 173 174 on Apple."
"7126050","7127610"," But this is close enough for me."
"7127950","7128930"," So I'm putting side. "
"7129290","7132330"," Do you guys fucking want to know when I'm putting size in the market?"
"7132990","7134290"," And here it is."
"7135170","7140050"," You guys are looking for you guys are like, well, Cap says he puts spreads on the market."
"7140470","7143750"," And Cap says he buys the market, but I'd never see it. "
"7144030","7145350"," I'm doing it right now."
"7145350","7147410"," So it's making me throw up."
"7147470","7148030"," I'll tell you that. "
"7148070","7149450"," I'm not feeling well with it."
"7152730","7155710"," Actually, I'm up $700 right now or something like that."
"7155810","7155990"," $800. "
"7156970","7158870"," So I'm down 3k on one trade."
"7159030","7162130"," I made a little bit of money, but not enough to make any difference on puts."
"7163470","7165150"," But I didn't continue on with puts. "
"7165510","7170550"," I started losing thousands on trying to buy this dip down here, but lost 3k I think."
"7173040","7174200"," So I'm making money right now."
"7174200","7178950"," But I am buying a call spread. "
"7179150","7181790"," So I just bought a call spread right now with some size."
"7182290","7185730"," I've got straight calls right now too for Friday."
"7185990","7190950"," I've got 4.47s, 4.51s, 4.55s for this Friday. "
"7192210","7198850"," And if we get another roll down here, we trade that 4.40 or the 173, 174 in Apple."
"7199270","7200930"," I'll roll into those two."
"7201710","7205130"," This is, you guys want to know how you put risk on the market. "
"7205130","7205770"," This is it."
"7207290","7208990"," So you keep doing it to me."
"7209030","7210650"," You keep fucking selling this market down. "
"7210730","7211590"," I'm going to keep buying it."
"7212770","7214690"," I'm going to buy all of it."
"7215050","7215930"," Shit, you're not. "
"7221980","7224240"," I assure you, it's not fun doing this."
"7226160","7227800"," But the payoff is usually pretty good."
"7228120","7233360"," So the payoff is, the payoff usually is a pretty big day. "
"7233360","7236420"," I'll go out to an Airbnb and piss away 20, 30,000."
"7236900","7238340"," I mean, like nothing to me."
"7238540","7247080"," So some long September 22nd, basically for all time highs. "
"7247980","7257690"," 265 or 4.65s. I don't think we get there, but if I can take 30% of that"
"7257690","7262250"," trade, I can take 30% of it and just kill it."
"7263510","7264850"," I don't hold these things too."
"7264930","7266610"," I don't hold these spreads to the end. "
"7266770","7267970"," I only hold them for like 30%."
"7267970","7269050"," If I can get 50, I'm stoked."
"7271330","7276710"," But I don't usually hold, you usually don't get the full 100% payout unless you hold it to the"
"7276710","7277790"," closing date. "
"7278270","7279470"," Or we go really, really high."
"7282400","7284160"," So just the word of caution to you."
"7285960","7291140"," If you trade, if you don't know much about trading spreads, sometimes you get all of it. "
"7291340","7301060"," If you get like an outsized move, but usually like 30%, 40%, you exit and try to reposition for a"
"7301060","7301420"," new trade."
"7309570","7310550"," I need some Tums."
"7315370","7316090"," Did I ever trade options?"
"7316330","7317210"," Yeah, I fucking trade futures. "
"7317810","7318270"," Fuck yeah."
"7318970","7319790"," I trade futures."
"7320550","7321930"," Not as much as I used to. "
"7323210","7324770"," I'm not exclusive to it anymore."
"7325030","7325870"," I will trade them though."
"7325990","7327050"," I do trade them at night time. "
"7327490","7330690"," So if I wake up and it's like, oh shit, I need to make some money."
"7331550","7333050"," I need to provide a position I will."
"7333210","7334010"," I trade them right now. "
"7334310","7335510"," I trade futures, yes."
"7336390","7337590"," But I don't trade them exclusively."
"7338590","7345410"," Most of this shows, so this show is not for, or it's for a futures trader, but this show is"
"7345410","7347290"," meant for losing traders. "
"7348350","7350250"," Stop losing their fucking money."
"7351550","7352450"," The young traders."
"7353850","7355250"," That's what this show is geared towards. "
"7355410","7358050"," If you want to trade futures, get inside the discord."
"7358930","7361150"," I used to trade them exclusively for a time."
"7362290","7363430"," I would never sleep. "
"7363690","7364910"," I was like walking around in a bath."
"7365070","7366250"," I was the bathroom guy."
"7366790","7369950"," So I don't do it anymore unless I know that I can make some money. "
"7370210","7372250"," I know where it's going."
"7373990","7375530"," I don't trade the wheel anymore."
"7375910","7377490"," I don't do a bunch of spreads anymore. "
"7377730","7378870"," I don't do any of that kind of stuff."
"7379030","7379690"," I've traded everything."
"7380150","7383890"," So there isn't, I'm trying to think of anything that I haven't traded. "
"7384390","7385730"," You know what I never traded?"
"7386670","7387910"," I never traded currencies."
"7389330","7390550"," I've never traded currencies."
"7390830","7392810"," Oh, and I have not traded. "
"7394250","7400910"," I've looked into trading options outside of the United States."
"7401810","7403810"," Options on crypto."
"7405940","7407640"," But I have not traded that either. "
"7408040","7409360"," I've never traded NFTs."
"7410160","7411140"," I have owned crypto."
"7411460","7416360"," I still have a bunch of crypto in an account that I don't look at. "
"7416620","7421940"," Anytime like crypto sells zero, like zero points, or point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero."
"7421940","7423740"," Zero, zero, zero, one."
"7424360","7426840"," I'll load up like a grand, 10 grand. "
"7427760","7429180"," And I never look at it again."
"7430120","7431760"," Like literally don't look at it again."
"7434880","7435620"," I do that. "
"7435740","7437500"," Matter of fact, I looked at my crypto account."
"7437980","7444200"," I looked at my crypto account recently and I was like, oh, I missed a huge rip."
"7444840","7445420"," It was like. "
"7446800","7447380"," So whatever."
"7447780","7448400"," I mean, it's what it is."
"7448540","7451240"," I'll just leave it there and check back on it to five or 10 years or something. "
"7451460","7452240"," Keep adding to it."
"7452940","7454540"," If I hit it rich, I'll hit it rich."
"7456530","7460610"," I used to like this trade Bitcoin way back in the day and I fucking sold it. "
"7461150","7464470"," If I just held it and left it for like 20 years, it'd be fucking big."
"7464630","7465230"," I have fuck you."
"7465310","7465950"," Go fuck you money. "
"7466190","7466350"," So."
"7468230","7469250"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7469510","7470250"," Oh, yeah. "
"7474180","7474740"," Oh, yeah."
"7475040","7476820"," Left a bunch of money right now."
"7481360","7483680"," Almost almost have gotten back when I lost. "
"7484860","7486160"," Almost fly on the day right now."
"7500320","7502200"," Squeezing trade in 4.46 right now."
"7504300","7506060"," Making some serious money right now. "
"7513580","7515500"," 4.51s are dogging still."
"7517180","7523100"," 4.55s look like real dog shit, but I got way more money on a higher trade."
"7523340","7523480"," So. "
"7526700","7528200"," This on the pain for it."
"7544290","7545370"," So you got longs."
"7545410","7546330"," They have some spreads in the market. "
"7546330","7547030"," That's good to see."
"7547310","7549250"," Haven't been able to put spreads on in some time."
"7549410","7552210"," I haven't had a spread on in months. "
"7553570","7554670"," So I'm happy there."
"7554670","7556190"," So I've got some spreads on spy."
"7556630","7557990"," I wanted to take them out on Apple. "
"7558950","7562330"," But I didn't like the payout on them for where it needs to go."
"7562710","7564530"," I have like an issue here with Apple."
"7564810","7569370"," Like I want to see Apple trade 200, but I don't think it trades 200 until Christmas. "
"7570330","7571870"," So I'm like looking at Apple going."
"7572390","7574810"," So I was looking at the price of Apple for spreads."
"7576750","7577150"," And. "
"7579210","7584800"," You know, like I'm like, yeah, I can Apple do 200."
"7584800","7585420"," Yes."
"7586280","7588040"," But more than likely it'll be. "
"7589500","7590600"," Oh, like Christmas."
"7591740","7592160"," I think."
"7592520","7592980"," Onica. "
"7593520","7594040"," Christmas."
"7594700","7595260"," New years."
"7598020","7599400"," Some like, yeah, that 200. "
"7599920","7600860"," That's like up there."
"7608020","7609660"," So I'm like, we'll hit that in September."
"7609820","7610760"," Probably not. "
"7610980","7611380"," Maybe."
"7611700","7612660"," Probably not."
"7613320","7614600"," It's like that mythical 200. "
"7615460","7618660"," It feels like Apple at 200 is a place to sell the market."
"7619460","7620960"," Like it's that some kind of connotation."
"7622060","7627560"," So I feel like they save Apple for like for like January 1st or something stupid. "
"7628840","7630740"," January the first week of January."
"7633080","7634480"," Something stupid like that."
"7634660","7638720"," You know, some kind of like historical marketplace or at least like, you know, calendar. "
"7639480","7644140"," It's like, well, you can't have spy go to 270 and not have Apple go to."
"7644320","7645980"," Or 265 or 266."
"7649380","7650460"," Like Apple has to be there. "
"7650500","7651160"," We're going to sell it."
"7651240","7652080"," That kind of stupid shit."
"7653880","7655440"," I'm looking at the Apple spreads. "
"7655720","7658760"," And I'm like, yeah, they're asking me to do it at 200."
"7661620","7665660"," When the A's an hour ago, and it's like, yeah, you do 200."
"7665760","7667840"," And I'm like, ain't doing the fucking 200s on Apple. "
"7668400","7672700"," I'll do the 200s on Apple for like January, like first week of January."
"7673080","7673900"," But the payouts, not that good."
"7674020","7674740"," It's better on spy. "
"7675020","7675140"," So."
"7677340","7679540"," So we're going to we're going to synthetically do it through."
"7680480","7681100"," Through spine. "
"7681400","7682620"," It's short time frame."
"7682780","7683580"," And I'm figuring here."
"7684860","7686780"," That's I'm not going to hold these call spreads. "
"7686780","7687980"," A couple of rules there in these spreads."
"7689260","7693920"," I'm not going to hold these call spreads into September 22nd."
"7694740","7697280"," I'm going to try to exit them at the latest. "
"7699260","7701940"," September 1st, maybe the 5th or 7th."
"7703340","7709740"," I hope not to hold them even to two or three weeks max."
"7712830","7714850"," I'd like to hold them only for two or three weeks max. "
"7715130","7716030"," So we'll see what happens there."
"7722680","7729420"," I guess the next question is, if I get rolled here, let's say we roll down to 440 or 425."
"7731120","7735540"," I'll take my licking and I will reenter again down there on spy. "
"7737340","7740940"," So I'm looking to put risk on continue to put risk on this market here."
"7743320","7745440"," And that sounds crazy to you."
"7745480","7746780"," This looks like doom doesn't it look. "
"7746780","7747380"," Look at all day."
"7747460","7748700"," Look how bad that looks."
"7749100","7750020"," That giant. "
"7750400","7750660"," Oof."
"7752520","7753520"," That nastiness."
"7754380","7756620"," Look at that blood in the marketplace dude. "
"7757600","7759960"," Vicious bears down there trying to sell the entire market."
"7760080","7763920"," Make you guys believe that we're having a market crash."
"7765180","7767600"," I'm fucking down here trying to put size in the market. "
"7770800","7771880"," So I was down here."
"7772240","7773540"," Got a taken down here."
"7774980","7775980"," Up right now. "
"7776260","7776760"," See what happens."
"7777180","7778280"," See if we can trade that back up."
"7782030","7784490"," If you're a bear and you think we can go down farther, we can. "
"7784590","7785770"," We can go down to S2 down here."
"7786490","7790010"," 442.81. No, we can even trade 440."
"7790470","7792590"," We can actually trade 425 and we're still bullish. "
"7794310","7795430"," 432 on spy."
"7796230","7797230"," 432 on spy."
"7798490","7800030"," And I'm still bullish there. "
"7801050","7802370"," That's how bullish I am."
"7808620","7812780"," Like any pullback here in daily trigger, any pullback on to weekly trigger and I'm buying it."
"7829910","7830790"," Yeah, I don't care. "
"7833010","7834010"," I'll be honest with y'all."
"7834130","7834510"," I don't care."
"7834810","7837170"," I don't care if it mean reverse all the way down to 425. "
"7841770","7842690"," I don't care."
"7842870","7843890"," This is going to be a banner year."
"7844210","7847930"," I looked at my year so far. "
"7848050","7848510"," My year is good."
"7849410","7853310"," My year is like you'd have to lose a million dollars or something stupid."
"7862560","7863540"," This has been a banner year. "
"7864480","7868500"," So you'd have to like we'd have to like trade 4000 like tomorrow."
"7873530","7874470"," I'm all about max."
"7874730","7876950"," I'm all about maximize and end of the year profits. "
"7878570","7880190"," I'm all about that all time highs."
"7880770","7881530"," I'm all about it."
"7881770","7883510"," I'm all over the all time highs. "
"7883810","7885930"," Gonna be out of your fucking mind if you think we're not going up there."
"7891570","7895170"," Trade this market sideways for two and a half, three years and you think we're not going up there."
"7895690","7896510"," Get out of your fucking skull. "
"7899150","7900750"," Paying people $50 an hour."
"7901710","7904770"," You don't think they're going to give us all time highs on S&P 500."
"7905910","7907890"," So they're not going to reprice the stock market higher. "
"7908270","7909110"," You're out of your fucking minds."
"7910450","7911170"," You are."
"7912150","7915190"," You get that you get that pay down to like 20 bucks an hour. "
"7915350","7917150"," We'll reprice the S&P 500."
"7922810","7931420"," Yeah, you're fucking skull."
"7946000","7946340"," Oh, yeah. "
"7946500","7947140"," Look at this right now."
"7947160","7948540"," I get a bunch of text messages here."
"7949080","7950640"," I think take one second. "
"7965220","7966300"," That's looking good."
"7971500","7972900"," Man, that's looking good."
"7978210","7978950"," That's kind of cool. "
"7979110","7979590"," I like that."
"7995480","7996200"," All right."
"8035320","8036880"," I'm going to the website right now. "
"8039460","8040540"," It looks really good."
"8053420","8059220"," Dude, if you could print me three, I said three, I mean, 10k today, it'd be heavy."
"8061000","8067640"," Microsoft turning green right now in the past hour, Microsoft up 0.3%. Apple up 0.19% the past"
"8067640","8067880"," hour. "
"8068780","8075500"," Meta up 0.65% and video up 0.85% in the last hour."
"8077860","8080860"," Nasdaq trading higher right now, trading 15."
"8082580","8083240"," 122. "
"8085200","8087800"," Now there is something to be said here."
"8087820","8089400"," Are you watching VIX right now?"
"8089980","8098510"," There is a bull plane forming on the five minute on VIX at 1643."
"8098950","8101650"," So the downside move might not be over yet. "
"8102910","8106890"," There's muted price action here on spy to the upside."
"8107190","8111530"," So just be aware here that on spy, right?"
"8111910","8112950"," Spy should be higher right now."
"8113030","8113290"," It's not. "
"8113870","8115370"," So it's kind of making me wary."
"8116470","8120950"," You're going to see VIX here roll over."
"8122150","8125310"," And if VIX rolls over, we should trade higher here. "
"8125770","8128510"," But then there might be a larger role to the downside."
"8129290","8131930"," So the role might not be over here."
"8132030","8132770"," So just be aware. "
"8133810","8140730"," Be safe in your trading that this move right here might not be over."
"8140970","8149940"," So to the downside, just be aware of this that we might not be done here."
"8150120","8151600"," So I'll leave that up for you to the downside. "
"8154060","8157240"," And VIX is showing that like squeeze higher and then a roll."
"8158520","8162720"," I'm trying to get this up here at least on some weekly calls."
"8164200","8167220"," I've got some 447s if they can make it up here. "
"8167720","8171040"," I've made one attempt to buy them and I'm making another attempt to buy them right now."
"8171940","8179120"," And I've got some 440, 451s and 455s for Friday as well."
"8180800","8183780"," Just be careful that last capitulation leg down. "
"8184540","8186680"," This would be Apple going to 473."
"8187080","8188860"," So just be aware of it in here."
"8195090","8197190"," Still no previous low down here. "
"8197570","8207370"," It's positive for bulls and then"
"8207370","8211870"," entering into call spreads for three weeks in September here."
"8227360","8229059"," Well, I'll say I got to write some notes down."
"8229320","8229620"," Give me a second. "
"8243660","8248200"," I went looking for a new office chair."
"8273030","8277610"," And I haven't been happy with new town."
"8277610","8284170"," I haven't been happy with what I found. "
"8285209","8286629"," You guys tell me what you think."
"8286850","8293660"," So tell me your experience has been still up right now."
"8296540","8299440"," Tell me your experience has been with office chairs. "
"8299980","8310160"," So I went to Costco and looked at, they had a lazy boy, a"
"8310160","8312320"," leatherish chair there."
"8312320","8314020"," That everyone highly rates."
"8314299","8315059"," I didn't like it. "
"8315120","8315719"," I thought it sucked."
"8316219","8317580"," It's like 200 bucks."
"8319540","8322200"," It wasn't as so my chair is like, I need a new chair. "
"8323120","8325760"," My chair now is nice."
"8326320","8327440"," It's breaking."
"8330020","8334700"," But I need I'm in need of a new chair. "
"8334940","8336280"," Now I don't like gaming chairs."
"8336860","8337799"," I'm not a fan of it all."
"8338820","8341440"," I'm not a fan of some of the. "
"8343219","8346200"," The chairs without like leather, I like leather backing."
"8346440","8347440"," I like the lumbar sport."
"8347620","8350719"," I like like great cushion on the bottom. "
"8351120","8354320"," I like it to be able to tilt backwards and lock if I need it to lock."
"8354920","8356520"," But the tilt feature as well."
"8357900","8359360"," And so then so I went there. "
"8359540","8362459"," I went to Staples or something like that."
"8362459","8362980"," Office Max."
"8363200","8363700"," I don't know which one. "
"8364059","8365959"," I was like a plaza or whatever."
"8365959","8367980"," And I didn't like any of their chairs either."
"8368540","8372760"," Then I went on Amazon and looked at some of their chairs and I felt like on Amazon, it was"
"8372760","8373400"," a minefield. "
"8375120","8378940"," Like if I order the wrong thing, I'm going to be like, oh, I got fucked out of 400 or"
"8378940","8379740"," $500 chair."
"8382100","8383379"," Not a fan of Herman Miller chairs."
"8384480","8385200"," Not a fan. "
"8386280","8388900"," Like some of their chairs do not like their office chairs."
"8389520","8390140"," Not a fan of them."
"8392140","8393720"," So I'm pretty active guy. "
"8394080","8395220"," I'm a pretty active guy."
"8395640","8397280"," So I don't need to stand."
"8398060","8399960"," I go out and I got kids. "
"8400640","8402820"," So like every night I go out with my kids."
"8404480","8405260"," Every day."
"8405480","8407640"," Like every morning, every night, there's something that we're doing. "
"8408020","8409220"," So I'm an active person."
"8409960","8413300"," Every weekend I spend out and about doing stuff."
"8414420","8415720"," So like I don't need like. "
"8416500","8424340"," Not like I don't don't spend a lot of my time sedated or not sedated, but in a set of"
"8424340","8424580"," entry."
"8430720","8432400"," Yeah, I don't like still case either."
"8432580","8433620"," So I like the full back. "
"8434820","8436560"," Uh, I like it full back."
"8436700","8440840"," I like a leather and I like it to have the high back where I can rest my head on"
"8440840","8441400"," some of those."
"8441520","8443080"," So some of those chairs I was looking at. "
"8444260","8445600"," People are like, nah."
"8446780","8450140"," They're like that doesn't come up high enough or it's not wide enough."
"8450800","8454740"," I like, um, I like armrests that move, but mine. "
"8455080","8456320"," These don't on this chair."
"8456320","8460880"," Um, do you guys feel like a chair is like."
"8462120","8466640"," Do you feel like a, uh, an office chair is something where. "
"8467620","8469380"," It's like a big scam industry."
"8470480","8472900"," And then because you can't see them in person."
"8473460","8474760"," Or sit in them. "
"8475280","8475820"," Uh, you're."
"8476260","8481480"," It's like you're buying, uh, I think I'm buying a name or I'm buying."
"8483300","8485120"," Like I think I need to sit in it. "
"8491780","8492920"," I like still case."
"8492940","8496100"," I have for a lot of years I used still case chairs."
"8496860","8498900"," When I was younger, but I'm getting older now. "
"8498900","8501500"," So I'm like, I've got injuries, all that kind of stuff."
"8502700","8504040"," I've done damage to myself."
"8504260","8506220"," Like I, I have done a ton of damage. "
"8506420","8509280"," So like if I sit in a chair, it needs to be supportive."
"8510000","8511440"," Uh, I need some comfort."
"8511500","8514000"," Uh, if I'm sitting in a chair, I'm the kind of guy that like. "
"8514660","8517640"," I can sleep on a concrete floor and feel good."
"8517940","8519820"," Like it feels good to sleep on a concrete floor."
"8521620","8525740"," But then when I'm sitting in a chair, I'm like, uh, I can't sit in a concrete chair. "
"8530240","8530880"," Secret lab."
"8537030","8537390"," Yeah."
"8537630","8538370"," See, I'm not feeling. "
"8538650","8540710"," Uh, for me, it's not tiredness."
"8541650","8543170"," Uh, I don't want to feel pain."
"8543870","8545990"," When I, when I get back up, I don't want to feel pain. "
"8547150","8549950"," So if I sleep on it, if I have a very comfortable bed."
"8551070","8553110"," Uh, sometimes I'll have to sleep on a floor."
"8553430","8556890"," So I sleep on a floor and everything real lines and I feel better. "
"8559130","8561490"," Uh, like my body feels better."
"8561590","8565730"," When I sit in a chair for some reason, the, the, the more correct it is."
"8566530","8570230"," Uh, the more pain I'm in, uh, the more worn down I feel. "
"8570370","8571510"," I feel like I'm standing on concrete."
"8572030","8573530"," So maybe a better way to describe it."
"8573610","8574070"," Maybe that's better. "
"8574810","8579930"," So if I'm sitting in a stiff chair, uh, when I get up, I feel like I was standing."
"8580110","8585270"," Do you guys know that if you stand on concrete all day long, uh, you become worn out, right?"
"8585270","8588730"," That's how I feel when I'm sitting in a, um, in a chair like that."
"8588990","8596070"," So yeah, that's the other thing is my height. "
"8596150","8597130"," So I'm six foot one."
"8597370","8601870"," So I'm like on the cusp of needing a big chair, but not quite there."
"8602450","8603970"," That's a big one right there, the height. "
"8604730","8608750"," So I was eating at high back chairs on Amazon and they were like, oh, the high back chairs are"
"8608750","8609830"," 26 inches."
"8610730","8614170"," From the, uh, back of the ass all the way up to your head."
"8614410","8616730"," And I was like, that's too, too short for me. "
"8629240","8630140"," Yeah, you like the mesh."
"8630400","8631400"," I can't do the mesh, man."
"8631400","8632560"," I can't do the mesh. "
"8632700","8633120"," I get it."
"8633200","8636860"," I see the reviews on it, uh, on the mesh."
"8637320","8643960"," So I see everybody say those arms chairs are awesome too, but I'm like, there's no fucking way. "
"8644020","8644620"," I'll never make it."
"8644720","8646340"," I'll sit in that thing and never get out of the chair."
"8646880","8647860"," I'll be like in pain. "
"8648980","8651800"," Speed's an iron once again on S&P 500."
"8657460","8660360"," Yeah, that's what I was thinking that the Amazon chairs were a scam."
"8660900","8665320"," And I don't mind paying 500 bucks for a chair, but I want to sit on it. "
"8665980","8667300"," And so that was my other question."
"8668080","8672960"," I've never owned a lazy boy chair, uh, but they were, they came recommended."
"8674320","8677320"," So I don't know if I have to go to like a lazy boy store. "
"8678080","8683180"," The one that I sat in at Costco looked like a knock off like a name only."
"8683380","8684180"," It was lazy boy."
"8687310","8689750"," Um, and I don't know if they're good chairs. "
"8689850","8693210"," I don't know if they've got a great, like they say they have all this great stuff."
"8693370","8696130"," And I'm like, I don't want to spend 500 bucks in a lazy boy."
"8696630","8699410"," And have it be a fucking knock off from China either. "
"8699930","8704330"," No offense to Chinese products, but to make great products, if you can find them."
"8704870","8706170"," Um, from the right company."
"8706830","8711710"," Their products do come from China, but most of China, most Chinese shit is garbage, right?"
"8712850","8716010"," Repackaged, free band, rebranded or even, even just full on fake. "
"8721370","8723030"," Back to making a ton of money up."
"8724070","8729430"," 20 cents right now on a $20,000, $19,000 trade, $19,300."
"8730390","8732210"," To be exact if you want to know the exact. "
"8737000","8738660"," Not fucking around here today."
"8743740","8745180"," Office Depot off the check."
"8745420","8746800"," I went to one of them this week. "
"8747800","8749320"," Uh, wasn't happy with it."
"8754510","8756790"," They have different kinds of office chairs too."
"8757190","8759230"," As a matter of fact, the one that I sat in, dude. "
"8759390","8765210"," So I sat in the, uh, the chair of Costco and it was called a manager's chair."
"8766170","8768190"," And it like leans forward."
"8768190","8770790"," And so they're like. "
"8771450","8775170"," So they're like, well, this makes you, uh, this makes you be able to work longer."
"8777100","8779140"," And I'm like, do I look like the fucking manager?"
"8779640","8783740"," I'm like, do I look like I want to be working fucking 12 hours a day?"
"8785500","8788660"," I want to sit in comfort for six or seven hours, maybe eight."
"8789100","8791460"," Well, I guess I do sit here a lot right now, but. "
"8802120","8804460"," The 80s Super Mario Brothers gaming chairs would be kind of cool."
"8805860","8808420"," My other thought was to do a, um."
"8809780","8813440"," My other thought was to do like a, uh, just a nice leather chair. "
"8815630","8820410"," Uh, some high quality and then have like a desk cart that rolls over to it."
"8822310","8823750"," Just for shits and giggles."
"8830230","8834150"," I sat in that manager chair lazy, what's called a lazy boy manager chair. "
"8834750","8838250"," And I sat in it and I was like, this, I was like, this feels like, I was like, this"
"8838250","8839190"," feels like cruel."
"8839830","8842570"," It's feels like your manager is like, yeah, fuck you too."
"8842730","8844130"," You're going to be in pain while you're working. "
"8845270","8852070"," It's kind of like the, uh, the, the benches out in the, out in the park with the stubs on"
"8852070","8852190"," them."
"8852270","8853570"," So you can't sleep on the park bench."
"8854410","8856390"," You can sit there, but you can't sleep there. "
"8858270","8862850"," If you sit there longer than 15 minutes, you're going to be in pain."
"8877220","8879800"," Yeah, Bowser, when you're in Detroit, let me know, man."
"8880580","8883180"," Uh, when you're in Detroit, March, come, what will hang up?"
"8884260","8884660"," 100%. "
"8886230","8888510"," If you come to Detroit, brother, I got you."
"8888630","8889150"," I got you covered."
"8890470","8891430"," Have a good time. "
"8895400","8900600"," Let me know like the week that you're coming to try to get some, uh, some invitations, some nice"
"8900600","8900900"," places."
"8901860","8903140"," And take it or speak easy, man."
"8903880","8906580"," We'll go to like, we'll go to the old Honson Detroit. "
"8914600","8915840"," Detroit's a fucking blast, man."
"8916620","8918020"," Detroit's getting blown up right now."
"8918220","8920060"," People in the Detroit subreddit are coming in. "
"8920060","8923680"," They're like, I thought this was like a hellscape apocalypse place."
"8924360","8928460"," If people are in there right now, like the Detroit subreddit, uh, people are visiting the city"
"8928460","8928920"," right now."
"8929820","8931460"," And they're like, I had no idea. "
"8932940","8936540"," How nice the city is actually, the city's fucking beautiful right now."
"8937500","8939360"," It's like becoming beautiful."
"8941700","8942960"," It really is. "
"8943120","8944720"," It's like coming into its own right now."
"8945180","8947160"," There's a lot more work to be done."
"8947880","8952120"," Uh, but there's a ton of great stuff happening in the city. "
"8952420","8953140"," I see it."
"8953320","8955740"," So I'm like, it's growing on me."
"8955900","8957380"," Some love is, I'm getting some love. "
"8958020","8959560"," Some like deep love for Detroit."
"8960040","8962560"," And I don't know if Detroit's ever had that in a long, long time."
"8962740","8966180"," So like the city is looking really good. "
"8967900","8971940"," And this still has its shit, but nowhere near what it once was, nowhere near."
"8977170","8977870"," Oh, yeah, baby."

"9319990","9321170"," Debit call spreads. "
"9322310","9324750"," Debit call spreads, not credit spreads."
"9325870","9326370"," Debit."
"9327170","9330070"," The key indicator is either credit or debit. "
"9331110","9332330"," Um, so they're debits."
"9336220","9338060"," Less risk of assignments in my view."
"9339120","9340860"," I'm only going to hold those three rules here. "
"9340860","9342740"," Ready or two or three rules here."
"9345540","9346520"," Um, there's a few."
"9346620","9347380"," I got a bunch of rules. "
"9347580","9348060"," I shouldn't say."
"9348160","9350640"," I say I'm like, ah, two or three rules, but there's a whole bunch of rules."
"9351640","9353160"," Uh, I try to take profit. "
"9353360","9354180"," Base rules are this."
"9356610","9357870"," I try to take profit."
"9358530","9361750"," If we begin to roll down a couple of things here, we begin to roll down to that weekly trigger. "
"9362190","9368590"," I'll exit or leave the put are the, um, the."
"9370390","9371570"," How do I explain this?"
"9371630","9372410"," Let me explain this better."
"9373970","9375070"," Uh, hold on. "
"9375150","9375610"," Let me write this down."
"9375650","9376610"," Let me write everything down here."
"9379620","9380980"," We'll write this down. "
"9382380","9384200"," If I write this down, we don't have to do it again."
"9384440","9385660"," I'm like, give me one second."
"9388140","9391820"," As we go, we go over this over and over again and people like big a video. "
"9392180","9393160"," So pinky if you're watching."
"9394540","9395780"," I'm going to do spread rules."
"9407470","9408810"," Let's see if I can write. "
"9411890","9412730"," Can I do a notepad?"
"9443100","9443700"," Push that over."
"9443700","9444640"," Damn it."
"9451000","9451900"," All right. "
"9452080","9452940"," CJ J."
"9453660","9457080"," Uh, debit."
"9458260","9458900"," Call."
"9461310","9461950"," But. "
"9463370","9463950"," Spread rules."
"9470280","9470920"," No."
"9482970","9483610"," Right. "
"9483790","9484910"," Right now I'm not put spreads."
"9485270","9488330"," I don't normally do put spreads because they tend to."
"9488570","9490010"," They tend not to. "
"9490550","9494210"," Uh, print well unless where we have actually rolled the market over."
"9494210","9497430"," So if we roll the market over, they, they do very well."
"9499550","9503310"," If we're in a bull market, they tend not to be as consistent. "
"9503830","9503970"," So."
"9506920","9510200"," I don't, I don't trade too many put spreads."
"9512570","9516170"," In a bull run until you get an actual market rolling over. "
"9516510","9517790"," Now the market rolls over."
"9517930","9518630"," They do very well."
"9519430","9522770"," They have a very high rate of, um, of hitting, but. "
"9523410","9524350"," My most consistent."
"9526690","9530090"," Is my most consistent is a few things."
"9530870","9532490"," Uh, so let's do it. "
"9532570","9533170"," Start the top."
"9533450","9533550"," So."
"9537630","9539650"," Try to buy them. "
"9542250","9543430"," Wait a minute here."
"9553930","9556910"," I forget how to change the, uh, forget how to change."
"9556910","9560560"," Is it, is it right clicking on it?"
"9561240","9561940"," All right. "
"9566540","9568460"," I try to buy a breath capitulation."
"9571860","9572600"," Whatever possible."
"9581760","9585080"," Remember possible try to try to buy on breath capitulation. "
"9585960","9588120"," Now are we on breath capitulation here?"
"9588420","9589120"," And not really."
"9589340","9591080"," We could go lower or close."
"9592380","9598810"," Uh, more time bet the better. "
"9602590","9617820"," Also, um, try to close before he dividends are paid."
"9624220","9625740"," We got a bunch of stuff to say here."
"9628220","9634140"," Uh, I try to close it. "
"9634140","9635220"," As long as I don't hold through."
"9636140","9638320"," Any kind of div, any kind of dividend shit."
"9644120","9645820"," I also, I also prefer. "
"9649800","9650460"," Uh, spreads."
"9652240","9652700"," On."
"9654640","9655100"," Ready. "
"9656340","9657800"," Uh, tickers."
"9661320","9663040"," That close to cash."
"9667880","9668640"," That's another one. "
"9669040","9669820"," I got a bunch of them."
"9670020","9674070"," A bunch of rules that I can get messed up in."
"9674330","9676150"," There's a bunch of reasons for all this stuff too. "
"9677450","9678950"," You can get into trouble for."
"9680190","9682450"," For spreads on tickers that close the cash."
"9685760","9687280"," Spy closes the cash. "
"9687860","9689120"," So, but that doesn't have a dividend."
"9694070","9696530"," Uh, try to trade."
"9699660","9701320"," In highly liquid. "
"9706210","9707150"," Uh, symbols."
"9710470","9712870"," Another issue here is getting these to actually."
"9713730","9713890"," Close. "
"9714690","9716850"," Once you open them, like be able to close them."
"9720440","9723360"," Oftentimes if it's moving in the direction you want it to."
"9725920","9731100"," Um, you'll get a close, but if it's not, you're not going to get a close. "
"9731160","9732560"," You have to accept less money."
"9737310","9739070"," So current direction."
"9739770","9741310"," Or direction matters. "
"9746160","9750500"," It's not good enough that we trade up to major resistance or support."
"9750860","9752640"," And then bounce or reject."
"9753240","9755240"," If you see that rejection or that bounce. "
"9756300","9759560"," You're going to see the offer on your spreads go to the dumpster, right?"
"9760660","9761600"," It's a problem."
"9771210","9771790"," Next thing."
"9777750","9780410"," Most circumstances, most of the time. "
"9784560","9787920"," Only hold to about 30% somewhere in there."
"9790810","9791610"," Why is that?"
"9793170","9796110"," And that that's mostly because on a timeline."
"9801300","9802540"," We'll bring that back up here in a second. "
"9802660","9804580"," If you if you open a spread, okay."
"9807660","9809740"," And let's say the spread is."
"9811080","9813460"," Let's say you open it on January one. "
"9813880","9814580"," So on one one."
"9817650","9820270"," And let's say your spread ends on three one."
"9823140","9826600"," Doesn't matter if it's a year, doesn't matter if it's two years, three years. "
"9828080","9829020"," Doesn't matter if it's a week."
"9832090","9841320"," Most of your spreads are going to make like 30% somewhere in here."
"9848580","9850220"," Especially if you're directionally right. "
"9864770","9866890"," What often happens to me now that you're right."
"9869510","9875190"," You end up waiting all this time to then capture that ninety one or ninety nine percent."
"9875790","9876910"," Sometimes it cranks. "
"9877810","9879590"," Being an outside move to the upside."
"9881010","9881570"," But for me."
"9882190","9884030"," Often times I get trapped. "
"9884990","9886010"," In a spread."
"9887590","9891930"," For like an obscene amount of time just to grab the rest of it."
"9898760","9903360"," So I'm just trying to oftentimes I'll build these spreads to pay three hundred percent. "
"9903360","9907020"," I didn't on this one."
"9908340","9909840"," Well, there wasn't a lot on offer."
"9909980","9911440"," They're kind of telling me you were going up there. "
"9911580","9912140"," So kiss off."
"9916000","9918140"," I do try to build spreads if I can."
"9918540","9920200"," And I didn't have time just then to do that. "
"9920340","9922320"," But normally I try if I can."
"9925340","9927740"," This is if I'm buying spreads to, by the way, not selling."
"9928000","9928800"," I got to write that up here. "
"9932140","9932840"," Buying rules."
"9937820","9938940"," I guess it's buying a spread."
"9940220","9942820"," Even though you're buying and selling calls and puts. "
"9942820","9944820"," Now try to buy a spread."
"9946600","9948680"," These are just simple credit spreads."
"9949480","9952720"," And debit call spreads credit debit spreads if you're buying them. "
"9952800","9953460"," Try to buy a spread."
"9955020","9957460"," With potential for three hundred percent."
"9961740","9963200"," So that I can take a hundred. "
"9964440","9967660"," But thirty thirty off a hundred works to right."
"9969360","9976420"," So three hundred percent."
"9978120","9980720"," Well, for a hundred percent, you know, or at least a hundred. "
"9981080","9983120"," Or at least do one hundred."
"9983220","9984000"," We'll do one hundred percent."
"9985020","9985920"," That's a minimum. "
"9988190","9989370"," That's what I'm trying for."
"9990130","9991570"," Most time only hold thirty percent."
"9991770","9992270"," Direction matters. "
"9992550","9993650"," The first spreads."
"9994330","9997010"," The tickers that are close to cash or close to cash."
"9997950","9999030"," Give it more time. "
"9999190","10000110"," The better is a big one."
"10001230","10002190"," Here's some more here too."
"10007090","10008330"," So let me see if I can write this. "
"10013580","10018570"," So an example."
"10035510","10037230"," A debit call spread."
"10042430","10044410"," A debit call spreads. "
"10045230","10045970"," A seller call."
"10047910","10049250"," A higher strike."
"10050190","10055480"," A buyer call a lower strike. "
"10062640","10063660"," A managed example."
"10075550","10077550"," So you're selling a call at a higher strike."
"10079710","10080530"," Damn it. "
"10086660","10088400"," You're buying a call at a lower strike."
"10088600","10089340"," I think I have that right."
"10090800","10092180"," I think I wrote that correct. "
"10109210","10111610"," Now people have different opinions on this stuff here."
"10112570","10114570"," On this specific stuff right here."
"10120850","10128490"," Some people will like the close one side if it starts to rip and just enjoy the max profits. "
"10131210","10134050"," For me, like this specific trade right here."
"10136690","10139690"," I'll try to take the money and run on that thirty percent."
"10141250","10144790"," Only on the bot call side. "
"10145350","10147610"," And try to run the other side down."
"10149050","10151010"," To capture the money on the other side."
"10152170","10153290"," It's a free trade. "
"10155870","10162030"," So for you, you can decide what your preference is, but sometimes people will come in and they'll"
"10162030","10162270"," manage."
"10162510","10165030"," This is kind of your next step into trading flies."
"10165790","10169350"," And it's beginning to sell spreads and stuff like that. "
"10169770","10171330"," Or even just sell calls and puts."
"10173230","10178470"," But people will come in and they'll manage these depending upon their preference, right?"
"10179230","10185590"," Like you'll close the call that you sold and just remain in the calls that you bought."
"10185590","10187750"," If you're like, oh, we're getting this huge retracement. "
"10188770","10191410"," And I don't want to dampen my earning ability."
"10193350","10196030"," Personally, I'll take the money on the bot call side."
"10196350","10197450"," That's where you go up, right?"
"10198030","10199670"," And I'll leave those sold calls on. "
"10201530","10203970"," As long as I fucking can, right?"
"10204690","10207090"," As long as I'm not going in the money with them so I can get assigned."
"10207710","10208930"," I'm going to tell you what assignment here too."
"10212690","10215770"," And that's part of the reasons above over there. "
"10216750","10219870"," You can become assigned to any option."
"10219870","10225310"," As a matter of fact, I owned bot calls last week, not in a spread."
"10226410","10229070"," And sure enough, they fucking closed them at zero. "
"10229390","10231050"," That's part of the assignment process."
"10232990","10239350"," I wasn't assigned those calls, but between 4.15 and 6 p.m. I got to give you a warning"
"10239350","10243890"," between maybe mixing words."
"10244170","10246010"," I'm trying to make this simple for you. "
"10246870","10253470"," Between 4.15 and 6 p.m. The price of options still change."
"10255450","10261270"," They have to assign calls and puts to underline they're supposed to."
"10261970","10264770"," Now, we know they don't actually have all those shares, right?"
"10265010","10267630"," We know that's a big scam, but you're going to get fucked. "
"10268170","10273410"," If you close, or if you don't close your calls and puts that you've bought or sold."
"10275250","10277490"," Or you have to give the potential to get fucked."
"10279350","10288030"," After hours after 4.15. As a matter of fact, I owned calls last week that closed at 12 cents. "
"10288890","10289910"," I had bought them."
"10290130","10291550"," I think that's seven and nine."
"10291930","10296430"," I think I was adding and adding and then it was on a close where I was expecting. "
"10296830","10297770"," They went to the moon."
"10297890","10301550"," They went to 27 cents and I couldn't get a close on them."
"10303410","10306970"," I didn't put a limit so on them I should have and I fucking didn't. "
"10307890","10309990"," Then I thought we were going to moon even more."
"10310270","10311990"," I'm going to stay in these calls."
"10312410","10317530"," This is after hours for 4 o'clock, 4.15. It was like 4.01. They hit 27 cents. "
"10318610","10321270"," I came back down to like 18, 17, 12."
"10323170","10324510"," Then I was like fuck, I'm going to stay."
"10324690","10328850"," I'm right to the 4.15. Then I was like the last two minutes, like 4.14, 4.15 in"
"10328850","10329170"," the afternoon. "
"10329390","10331330"," I'm like, maybe I'll squeeze it up the last bar."
"10332110","10333130"," Then I'll get paid."
"10333130","10339350"," They squeeze it up afterwards and they rolled it between like 4.15 and fucking six o'clock. "
"10341150","10345630"," Now, did I get the fucking higher price on the on the calls after 4.15?"
"10346130","10346890"," Fuck no."
"10347510","10354490"," And guess what they gave me at 6 p.m. Bag of dicks is what they gave me."
"10355170","10360010"," And they assigned me to a price on that option where they were trying to fuck somebody else. "
"10360670","10362710"," It didn't close their fucking calls in a spread."
"10368020","10371560"," So guess what I woke up to a message the next morning."
"10371560","10373580"," I probably had another, I probably had an email. "
"10373720","10377300"," I didn't check it, but I'm sure I got an email that said something stupid."
"10377780","10383140"," Like, you know, you owe us fucking $200,000 or something."
"10383380","10385920"," Or $85,000 or $50,000 or the fuck it was. "
"10386980","10388640"," Or some kind of insane thing, right?"
"10391340","10394140"," Now, of course, it resolved itself in the open."
"10394140","10403360"," And to that point, I had to call my broker and get that money back from him."
"10403880","10406200"," Now, you can do that if you have a broker. "
"10407620","10410780"," You guys that trade on Robin Hood can't call your broker."
"10411300","10412980"," Webull, you can't call your broker."
"10414400","10417960"," Now, I call my broker and say, what is this bullshit?"
"10421190","10423130"," And I had the closing price on. "
"10423130","10430990"," I had the closing price on my, uh, I"
"10430990","10435050"," don't know, my fucking options page or whatever."
"10435370","10437150"," So I was pretty fucking pissed that morning."
"10437690","10442790"," Now, that's when a broker or that's when a broker comes in for you or your broker, a voice that"
"10442790","10443390"," you can call. "
"10443810","10450210"," You shouldn't, I would, like, if you want to create, you can create an option or spreads on Robin"
"10450210","10453170"," Hood, but dude, you need that support."
"10454290","10456750"," There was a kid at one time that committed suicide."
"10458150","10463270"," And he thought he was, he thought he was in a losing position by a substantial amount of money. "
"10463950","10465590"," He actually made money in that trade."
"10465890","10472030"," But between the time that the weekend had come and the time that he had, or someone else figured it"
"10472030","10475450"," out, he thought he was going to lose his whole life."
"10476270","10477630"," His whole life was doomed. "
"10477630","10485670"," So I want you to know that there's some, not just dangers here, but, uh, there's, there's also"
"10485670","10488090"," some, uh, potential for you to panic."
"10488950","10491230"," Uh, and cause you deep stress."
"10491890","10495490"," Uh, so I want you to know that out there as a full disclaimer on trade and any kind of"
"10495490","10498350"," spread, any kind of spread, any kind of spread, even just calls or puts. "
"10499050","10500010"," Cause it just happened to me."
"10500730","10502010"," I was pretty fucking angry over this."
"10502390","10507690"," Sorry for swearing again, but I'm telling you what, I was quite angry that, uh, I got taken for a"
"10507690","10512190"," lot of money, a substantial amount of money on that, on that trade. "
"10512330","10515170"," And I had to call back and be like, you know, I'll just, I'm going to drop you."
"10515330","10515870"," I'm going to blow you."
"10516030","10523080"," I was like, I'm going to get mad here, like, um, about, about being taken for this ride. "
"10523200","10526260"," So anyways, I learned my lesson though, didn't I?"
"10527080","10529120"," I'll never ever leave another caller put."
"10530080","10530160"," Ever."
"10531780","10533860"," Uh, on the day of expiry. "
"10534980","10537240"," Two clothes at four, fifteen."
"10537440","10540840"," I will always close that last about two, four, fourteen in the afternoon."
"10541420","10542340"," Four, three, fifty nine. "
"10542480","10546440"," If it's not for a ticker like apple or something, tassel, something like that."
"10546580","10547760"," But an index, never again."
"10548740","10553360"," Will I ever leave, um, something to close where I'm making money. "
"10557080","10558640"," Uh, so a couple of things here, right?"
"10558900","10559360"," Uh, managing."
"10559780","10561920"," So a big thing here is like managing your position."
"10562460","10565120"," Uh, I'm not going to tell you what the best way to do that is. "
"10565580","10568060"," People have different theories and thesis's on this stuff."
"10568280","10571520"," I don't mind so much leaving some of this stuff on."
"10572140","10576180"," As long as it's not in the money, uh, to try to get the backside of that trade. "
"10576780","10580900"," Uh, take the, realize the money on the top side of the trade or the down side of the trade."
"10581220","10583740"," I normally have a target that I'm actually looking for to hit."
"10584620","10592390"," And if that's like some major resistance or major support, I'll manage that trade, uh, to put the"
"10592390","10592890"," other side. "
"10593730","10595730"," And see if I can collect some back end money."
"10595730","10599950"," So right now that 30% is kind of set in stone."
"10601170","10605990"," Or that 100% trade, but you can actually make more off these trades is the point that I'm trying"
"10605990","10606790"," to make to you. "
"10606870","10612450"," If you manage the inside part of the trade, whether you're buying and selling, uh, butterflies, uh,"
"10612610","10616350"," you've got four options on or you're just doing something simple, like, uh, like a, like a, like a,"
"10616410","10618210"," uh, debit or a credit spread."
"10619150","10623610"," Um, some more rules that I have though too, is which, what I don't, uh, put here is what I"
"10623610","10624510"," just discussed was."
"10624510","10632880"," Uh, always close, uh, your spreads before expiring. "
"10640390","10641310"," Is it a Y?"
"10641590","10642590"," I think it's a Y, but I'm not sure."
"10642710","10643450"," I think it might just be Y."
"10648000","10648600"," Always."
"10650400","10652540"," You have to manage these things. "
"10652780","10654120"," You cannot let them just go."
"10654580","10665040"," And, uh, it's not a bad idea to, to"
"10665040","10666200"," set email alerts."
"10669900","10670300"," That major. "
"10672280","10673640"," Support and resistance."
"10673640","10682810"," And I mean before, I mean before and on before you get there."
"10683030","10688210"," So, uh, if you're coming into major support or major resistance, coming into it. "
"10688590","10693190"," It's a good time to close the spread as there's demand for those spreads."
"10694210","10696810"," Um, another key point here would be."
"10698490","10700410"," Very talk about time being your friend. "
"10701490","10703670"," More time the better already talked about that one."
"10710160","10715060"," Another one point that I want to talk to you about is if you are, if you are positioned wrong."
"10723180","10724480"," Uh, what do I do?"
"10729480","10731820"," And that comes back to that management above. "
"10732360","10734320"," Uh, now we're going to talk about that as well."
"10734520","10736500"," So let's say we roll over here, right?"
"10737740","10740100"," Uh, I sold a four sold."
"10740400","10740900"," What did I sell?"
"10743860","10746840"," I sold a four 65 call, right?"
"10747500","10749860"," So if we roll over here, I could. "
"10750280","10751340"," That major support."
"10752140","10754080"," Or where I am right here."
"10754440","10755440"," So just watch my cursor. "
"10756760","10760400"," So I bought this, uh, OTM or this in the money call."
"10760560","10760980"," Excuse me."
"10761600","10764360"," I'm fucking trying to keep track of all the stuff in my head. "
"10764380","10764660"," So."
"10765540","10767080"," I buy arm dump."
"10767800","10769260"," I bought it in the money call. "
"10769260","10775160"," I could cut that loose and just leave the sold call on, right?"
"10775860","10776660"," To go the other way."
"10777440","10779300"," Another thing that I can do."
"10780160","10785780"," Is if I'm directionally right in my thesis and I have enough time on my call spread. "
"10786020","10788340"," And it doesn't print immediately."
"10789060","10794180"," I don't get my 30% right away."
"10794180","10801460"," I would then switch to a holding that spread to the bitter end. "
"10803060","10805320"," So think about that for a second."
"10805880","10807740"," So if we were to roll over here."
"10808420","10809800"," I have two options. "
"10810820","10815220"," The first option is to sell the call that I bought."
"10816400","10819700"," And hold the OTM call."
"10820340","10821300"," That I sold. "
"10822080","10823780"," I think I'm saying that right."
"10824240","10826240"," If I'm saying that wrong, correct me in the chat."
"10827840","10829980"," Even the trade spreads knows what I'm talking about. "
"10830120","10831220"," If you don't know what I'm talking about."
"10832880","10835780"," I'm going to direct you somewhere to learn about this in just a moment."
"10836820","10840680"," We're going to end this with with some some direction on where to learn about this stuff. "
"10840960","10841080"," So."
"10844820","10845700"," All right."
"10845880","10847200"," So now for me. "
"10847200","10850260"," I not just feel."
"10851240","10853760"," I'm looking at a macro view of the market."
"10854020","10855940"," So I'm looking at like a weekly. "
"10856740","10858060"," A daily chart."
"10858280","10860520"," I'm looking at a whole bunch of other crap back row stuff."
"10860980","10863780"," I'm looking at PPO PMO in the background. "
"10864120","10864920"," I'm looking at bread."
"10865560","10866960"," I'm rarely wrong."
"10867660","10870460"," Like rarely like 95% of the time. "
"10871300","10872520"," When higher time frames."
"10873420","10875960"," When I place that trade with enough time on it."
"10876640","10878260"," It's going to eventually be right. "
"10878680","10878760"," Right."
"10879140","10879540"," That's like that."
"10879760","10881660"," That put spread for September. "
"10882200","10884660"," They're going to go to the money at some point between now and October."
"10885360","10887120"," At some point we're going to go down there."
"10887900","10888720"," Is it right now?"
"10888900","10889220"," I don't know. "
"10889440","10890960"," But eventually those will print."
"10891900","10893280"," And people will be happy on the put side."
"10893740","10894960"," Even though they're selling you doom. "
"10895700","10897800"," They're just trying to print some fucking put spreads for September."
"10899580","10902920"," So I point here is that no, they're not telling you that publicly."
"10903200","10904220"," They're going to lie to you publicly. "
"10906220","10907160"," I say you not."
"10907920","10915360"," So so my point here though is sometimes when we're down here, let's say we roll this down and I'm"
"10915360","10917180"," still confident in us going up."
"10917180","10919160"," Let's say right I'm confident in us going up. "
"10919380","10924280"," I'm hitting that and hitting that for 65 by September 22nd."
"10924280","10926800"," It's not actually then I think the 1st of September."
"10927960","10930100"," I'm putting 241 right now on those calls. "
"10932380","10938160"," My point here is that I've been in spreads where I was I was immediately directionally wrong."
"10938960","10941340"," But ultimately my thesis was right."
"10942400","10945580"," And I've stayed in them until the bitter end. "
"10946260","10953320"," And I've had call spreads print the day of their expiry."
"10953320","10955900"," And here's the last point I'm going to talk to you about here."
"10957260","10959720"," So when you're managing your spreads. "
"10961020","10967160"," Do you ever notice when we come into month end or quarter end?"
"10968200","10971760"," You'll see like some really like crazy stuff in the market."
"10971980","10975820"," People will be like why are we trading here into end of month?"
"10976320","10979180"," Why are we trading here a week after month end?"
"10979180","10982220"," Why are we trading here at end of quarter?"
"10989660","10990580"," Hold on here."
"10990780","10993880"," I got to I got to keep my eye on this over here. "
"10996140","10999000"," I'm making fat money right now."
"11005940","11011740"," Two fifty five right now a dollar ninety three on nineteen thousand dollar trade."
"11023520","11025320"," So the idea here is that. "
"11029180","11031140"," So the idea here is that."
"11033520","11036860"," So if I'm positioned wrong what am I going to do right?"
"11037200","11038640"," How do I how do I manage this trade?"
"11045640","11049680"," So I'm trying to read the chat here where you guys are talking about AMC."
"11054690","11055830"," This we're going to sex. "
"11056050","11061210"," My fact who just wrote that big big a balls just said took me a bit to understand spreads until"
"11061210","11062810"," I started doing them."
"11062810","11068770"," So the management of these trades is important for you to understand."
"11068910","11070950"," The mechanics of them are important for you to understand. "
"11071530","11073130"," Sometimes I'll say to people."
"11074070","11080070"," Take one of those spread trades a basic your base the most basic spread you can take is a debit"
"11080070","11080610"," spread."
"11082130","11088350"," The it gets more complicated with credit spreads and then condors and butterflies and then the very"
"11088350","11090150"," endless variations of them. "
"11092300","11097300"," There are some other arcane ones like back spreads are really fun."
"11097540","11100740"," There's bull backs call backs I think they're called call back spreads."
"11102500","11107240"," You can get into trading two sixty two right now. "
"11113980","11116480"," Thinking about taking these fucking things off right here."
"11124740","11128020"," Stalling two fifty seven didn't get a full bill there."
"11134490","11135710"," That's it I'm out on those. "
"11137710","11139770"," I'm flat on four forty sevens."
"11144420","11149740"," Still on four fifty ones and four fifty threes four fifty threes are coming back."
"11149800","11151240"," I'm making money right now both of those. "
"11152460","11157360"," I'm making money on forty threes and I'm making money on forty one right now because I kept DC and"
"11157360","11157820"," down there."
"11159360","11161400"," Still holding those for Friday."
"11161780","11162760"," It's not as much money. "
"11163720","11166960"," I was a little scared on the big trade still have spreads."
"11168540","11171600"," Now sorry I'm trying to look at a bunch of shit here in the background."
"11175200","11180840"," Now if you're going to start with debit call spreads or credit spreads. "
"11181200","11182220"," Credit spreads are wild."
"11183240","11186340"," Credit spreads rely on a little bit of time."
"11197320","11202660"," Credit spreads rely upon theta burn but not quite like debit spread. "
"11202660","11208840"," Credit spreads are built for theta burn down the road as you get closer expiry."
"11209680","11212820"," Credit spreads directionally will fucking fire off."
"11213160","11215740"," They will like start moving really fast. "
"11216080","11219640"," Very dangerous and very dangerous and getting assignments."
"11220800","11223060"," So we're not going to tell what credit spreads today."
"11223200","11224700"," I don't even want to talk about that with the new trader. "
"11225460","11226100"," Just debit spreads."
"11226800","11229320"," I said I said both up here but."
"11230860","11233260"," So just debit call puts spreads. "
"11233400","11236140"," We're going to talk about credit spreads with a new trader with that right here."
"11241580","11244360"," Yeah that's another good point career global being in the money."
"11244460","11245080"," That's another thing. "
"11245340","11246480"," Never take them to end the money."
"11246660","11247500"," That's another good point."
"11248160","11249620"," I'm going to write that down too. "
"11255870","11257350"," I should say three hundred here."
"11259550","11260070"," Hold on."
"11263090","11264850"," Never hold two in the money. "
"11265950","11266550"," Good point."
"11269190","11271090"," I should be more clear on that."
"11271690","11273310"," Thanks for saying that career low. "
"11279680","11281380"," Thanks for mentioning that."
"11289570","11290830"," I like credit spreads."
"11291350","11293650"," I don't like it for a first time option trader. "
"11294710","11295390"," I don't like them."
"11295510","11298430"," I feel like just learn debit spreads then we'll do credit spreads."
"11299470","11302030"," So debit spreads they're easier. "
"11302370","11303510"," The easiest one to trade."
"11304390","11305790"," They move kind of slowly."
"11306150","11307410"," You can put three months on them. "
"11308530","11309670"," They do their thing."
"11314070","11315690"," I thought you were referring to that."
"11316030","11317030"," Never fucking hold. "
"11317250","11319170"," I don't never hold any of that shit."
"11319490","11320690"," Well I should say never."
"11321050","11322790"," If it's at the end of the fucking trade I will. "
"11323770","11327430"," I will hold them like ninety one ninety ninety percent something like that."
"11328570","11329710"," And then I'll sell them."
"11330410","11331070"," What else?"
"11331730","11333550"," We'll talk about assignment at some point as well. "
"11334790","11336970"," Who said this above?"
"11337630","11338790"," I wanted to roll into this too."
"11341120","11343120"," Big A balls took a set."
"11343400","11345840"," Took me a bit to understand spreads and so I started doing them. "
"11346340","11347940"," That would be the last part of this."
"11350920","11356740"," You're going to read and watch videos."
"11357920","11358680"," I'm assuming. "
"11361940","11363900"," I'm assuming you're going to do either of these two things."
"11366370","11368870"," You are likely not going to understand."
"11373030","11374510"," Going to understand. "
"11375270","11378070"," The actual mechanics."
"11382370","11382970"," Unless."
"11384990","11386010"," You take. "
"11386950","11387570"," A trade."
"11389330","11391150"," Now I want to say something to this too."
"11392050","11393150"," I don't know. "
"11393490","11394570"," I've never paper traded."
"11395030","11395830"," Maybe I don't know."
"11396010","11396310"," I might have. "
"11396450","11397150"," I haven't fucking paper."
"11397910","11398090"," Never."
"11398510","11401890"," So I don't know the full mechanics of paper trading. "
"11402790","11403890"," With spreads."
"11406670","11407410"," I'm going to."
"11407490","11409190"," I'm going to tell you that I highly doubt. "
"11412110","11413210"," Oh fuck yeah."
"11413430","11415050"," 41's trading 98 right now."
"11415390","11416710"," 24 on 45's. "
"11417570","11418610"," I don't know."
"11419590","11421730"," If they just automatically close for you."
"11421890","11423570"," My assumption here is that they will. "
"11424230","11427850"," I want you to realize that when you're trying to close these things out."
"11428850","11433730"," You're going to be inside of the actual trade that you're in."
"11434550","11435310"," In this. "
"11435510","11436570"," Another fucking rule."
"11436950","11439650"," I've got so many rules like all these things you've got to think about."
"11440430","11442210"," Make sure that you can close. "
"11445130","11447110"," And close individual legs."
"11451900","11452780"," From your broker."
"11453160","11455900"," If your broker does not allow you to close individual legs you get a problem. "
"11456880","11459080"," And sometimes you're trying to close spreads."
"11459440","11460240"," You're not going to get fills."
"11460520","11461980"," You're going to be like no we're not filling this for you. "
"11462480","11464100"," So you're going to have to go in there manually."
"11466240","11468840"," Adjust the price that you're willing to accept."
"11468840","11470580"," To close spreads. "
"11471000","11471520"," Okay."
"11472280","11474800"," And I don't know if paper trading does that for you."
"11474840","11478760"," Paper trading might just be like yeah the offer is five dollars. "
"11479280","11480240"," And boom it closed."
"11481480","11482520"," I'm never shocked."
"11483160","11484420"," Like I'm never shocked. "
"11484660","11486300"," Like if I'm closing a spread like three bucks."
"11487060","11491240"," Going like a 290, 280, 270 trying to get out of that spread."
"11492820","11494720"," Or one side's not closing. "
"11495080","11496720"," There's just not a bid for it."
"11496720","11498500"," Like one side will have a bid."
"11498700","11500080"," The other side's like way down. "
"11500700","11504340"," So I don't know how to explain that better."
"11505040","11512100"," Paper trading doesn't give you the experience of the mechanics that you're trying to piece together"
"11512100","11513660"," of the trade."
"11516290","11517410"," Keep on squeezing baby. "
"11518630","11521170"," Keep on fucking squeezing."
"11534060","11534600"," Price target."
"11534600","11540120"," Four forty seven ninety. "
"11542510","11543990"," Four forty seven ninety."
"11550460","11552860"," Trading four forty seven fifty three."
"11555630","11559570"," I'm going to close out some calls as we arrive up here. "
"11559670","11560290"," Not my spread."
"11560290","11561570"," Just weeklies that I'm in."
"11569970","11573210"," We've got four forty seven ninety as a target to the upside. "
"11581560","11581880"," So."
"11583000","11584700"," So on these call spreads."
"11586260","11588260"," We're going to talk about the rest of this. "
"11588260","11588820"," The mechanics."
"11589860","11591140"," Understanding the mechanics."
"11591780","11596100"," There's like if you read a book and you watch YouTube videos. "
"11597440","11600340"," It still doesn't give you the full."
"11600840","11602880"," This is going to be sound horrible to say."
"11605600","11613700"," Sometimes it's not bad to have the experience of watching the full life cycle of a spread. "
"11614460","11617400"," Even if you end up losing money on the spread."
"11618220","11621120"," Like I was making money and then I was losing money in the spread."
"11621400","11623680"," You don't have to do that. "
"11624020","11626800"," Eventually you're going to go through that entire cycle."
"11627480","11628740"," While you're trading these spreads."
"11629680","11631000"," And you're going to you're going to encounter. "
"11632360","11633320"," These experiences."
"11633660","11635940"," They'll teach you lessons that you've learned."
"11636280","11638980"," From your reading and you're watching of YouTube videos. "
"11638980","11640700"," You'll say I don't understand all this."
"11641140","11644300"," I'm grasping the concepts but I'm not putting it together."
"11644980","11647040"," Usually the last piece of the puzzle. "
"11647940","11650400"," Is each time you go through these."
"11651780","11655220"," Each time you go through these experiences in the life of a spread."
"11656780","11658120"," You're not going to gain that. "
"11658260","11661160"," I don't think from paper trading."
"11662520","11665600"," You'll gain some of the paper trading but not from the actual."
"11666400","11667760"," It's a weird fucking thing. "
"11668100","11669220"," It's a hard thing to explain people."
"11670920","11673260"," Because you're going to see the price for options go up and down."
"11673380","11675240"," Even though price is higher options down again. "
"11675440","11678840"," Your spreads are down and you're not making money anymore."
"11678840","11680120"," You're like why is the market going up."
"11680160","11682280"," My fucking spreads are what I paid for them. "
"11682680","11684780"," Like all that stuff you need to experience."
"11692000","11696200"," Trading 4.47.41. Just a note here."
"11696360","11696900"," If you're a bull. "
"11697480","11698520"," I'm going to give you a warning."
"11699540","11701740"," We're going to come back to these spreads here in just a minute."
"11702860","11705520"," I'm going to give you a warning if you are a bull here. "
"11706060","11707580"," As we trade up."
"11715640","11717280"," As we trade up here."
"11732100","11734860"," We'll give you a warning out there if you are long here. "
"11735160","11735760"," Pay attention."
"11780570","11782130"," There is a giant."
"11783290","11785470"," Group of sellers right here. "
"11801570","11802130"," Giant."
"11803630","11805230"," Wolves right up in here."
"11807820","11809520"," Remember that red box is up there. "
"11809520","11840570"," The last"
"11840570","11843370"," part of this discussion on the mechanics."
"11843730","11844550"," The underlying mechanics."
"11857850","11860670"," I'm trying to trade here and give a lesson on spreads. "
"11863230","11863990"," In-stream."
"11864830","11865490"," In-read chat."
"11901050","11902830"," I don't know why I'm capitalizing that. "
"11903010","11903590"," Not the other stuff."
"11903830","11903850"," Whatever."
"11904230","11904730"," It's what it is. "
"11905930","11909890"," This is important for you to understand is that you have to actually trade these things."
"11910030","11910610"," You can't be scared."
"11911770","11914530"," I'm going to take 300 bucks or 500 bucks. "
"11915030","11916950"," I'm going to open one spread."
"11917990","11918610"," 100 bucks."
"11918790","11919350"," Whatever it is. "
"11921890","11923090"," You practice."
"11924130","11928910"," You have to practice to learn the underlying mechanics."
"11929530","11930590"," I assure you of two things. "
"11931410","11938930"," If you conceptually grasp the concepts that are presented to you in the videos and books."
"11938930","11941710"," And then you take these trades."
"11941710","11943410"," It'll come together for you. "
"11943410","11945230"," You'll be like, I get what he's saying."
"11946330","11951510"," You'll have a better understanding of the Greeks too."
"11951950","11955750"," They really do play themselves out and they're glaring inside of spreads. "
"11956670","11961550"," How Greeks work in your benefits in these spreads."
"11961550","11963830"," The last parameter is this though."
"11964370","11974110"," If you have been out there watching videos on YouTube or reading books, the greatest tool or"
"11974110","11980930"," the two greatest tools I can give you would be to watch videos from the options industry council. "
"11992200","11994980"," Now their videos are pretty dry."
"11995720","12002480"," They're not going to have the smile and white teeth in the parted hair and the cute little colors"
"12002480","12003240"," in the background."
"12004080","12007800"," They're going to be serious videos put out by the CME. "
"12010200","12013240"," It's a nonprofit that's funded by the CME."
"12013780","12015820"," Teach retail traders how to trade."
"12016580","12019380"," That's your first resource that I would go to. "
"12020040","12028020"," And I would also say to you that they have a huge library that you should be listening to at"
"12028020","12028400"," minimum."
"12028400","12033580"," You can download YouTube videos to audio files or even to video files."
"12034520","12038840"," Download them to a zip drive, whatever it is you use, your phone, I don't care. "
"12041220","12043520"," Make them small files if you need to."
"12044160","12046360"," Play them when you're driving back and forth from work."
"12046960","12050480"," When you're going on vacation, play them while you're taking a shower. "
"12051340","12054820"," Put them on the background when you're trying to sleep at night time and just listen to their"
"12054820","12058140"," videos over and over and over and over again."
"12059720","12062780"," And as you trade, hold on there, you're going to put this up."
"12064790","12073790"," As you listen to these videos, you can then go back and watch your favorite YouTuber that does that"
"12073790","12074130"," stuff. "
"12074950","12080090"," But you want to like drive that into your brain like repetitively or repetitively or repetitively."
"12080270","12084470"," You want to be reading the book when you kind of book see like and then also you want to"
"12084470","12085690"," be actively trading."
"12085690","12093930"," It was like the least three sources of information, like three different ways of learning how to"
"12093930","12094650"," trade these spreads. "
"12095290","12100570"," The last part that I would say is trade them with other people, actively trade them with other"
"12100570","12101630"," people trading spreads."
"12102730","12104190"," Start to ask people, hey, do you trade spreads?"
"12104730","12110370"," Do you trade them for a week, do you trade them for a month, three months and find out from"
"12110370","12112450"," these people when they enter these trades."
"12112450","12117650"," And trade alongside those people, see how they manage their trades. "
"12118490","12120610"," And that was going to lead me into the second resource."
"12120790","12123570"," And that's going to be to find John L."
"12124290","12126250"," inside of our discord."
"12127490","12129010"," Are you going to find John L."
"12129750","12130810"," He's in our discord. "
"12132410","12141770"," And he has made multiple videos, multiple audio tracks and has an entire education."
"12141770","12144710"," It's an entire education series on trading spreads."
"12145130","12149490"," Now the stuff that I've told you to this point may not be a hundred percent accurate. "
"12150050","12152910"," I just know that that's how my brain thinks about spreads."
"12153570","12155510"," I know that that's the stuff that's stuck with me."
"12156250","12159430"," And these are the main things that I use when I'm trading spreads. "
"12160490","12166170"," And I don't trade spreads, but for I'm looking for like a month, two months, three months on a"
"12166170","12166410"," spread."
"12167310","12169190"," It's a main driver of my account."
"12169190","12177510"," So it's a for me, the safest way for me to not the safest safest way for me to grow"
"12177510","12182390"," my account is own the underlines actually own stocks. "
"12182390","12187630"," It's very hard for me to lose money unless I sell buying the underlying."
"12190590","12192910"," It's a big meme too, but it's true."
"12193670","12194950"," It is true. "
"12196170","12201190"," The way to grow an account though pretty aggressively is through spreads."
"12202470","12209270"," And safely like the next safest way but to grow an account with more gains usually is through some"
"12209270","12209930"," form of spreads."
"12211730","12217650"," Now my take on one last thing I would say to you on this is try to keep it simple. "
"12221640","12223020"," Mark my words on this."
"12226360","12227300"," Keep it simple."
"12228400","12232320"," The more complicated you make a trading life, the more pain in the acid is. "
"12235640","12237300"," Seriously, keep it simple."
"12238080","12239180"," I have traded the wheel."
"12239600","12240380"," I've traded flies. "
"12240960","12241820"," I've traded condors."
"12242540","12247020"," Maybe you're I should say something else."
"12249310","12250590"," Unless you're that person. "
"12256350","12260870"," Like if you're not working a job, if you're detail oriented."
"12260870","12266290"," If you're have all kinds of time in your hands, you don't have a wife and kids."
"12267110","12267670"," A job. "
"12268730","12270690"," You're not going to disappear for a week."
"12271170","12272290"," Pike and bike and sailing."
"12272690","12273590"," I don't care what it is. "
"12274730","12277810"," I feel like I've got the time to manage all this stuff."
"12278630","12279450"," You're not streaming."
"12280750","12283610"," You're not other responsibilities in life. "
"12284270","12285210"," Yeah, it might be for you."
"12285790","12289010"," Because there's a rabbit hole here where you're going to think you're really smart."
"12290290","12292410"," And you're going to try to manage your trades. "
"12293170","12296370"," And you're going to wake up every morning and you're going to know exactly where you are in the"
"12296370","12296710"," market."
"12296710","12300430"," You're going to have calls and puts bought and sold littering your accounts."
"12301650","12306170"," And you're going to win like 20, 10, 20, 30 percent, like nine times in a row. "
"12307450","12309670"," And then you're going to lose that one big one."
"12310590","12312670"," And then you're going to look at those 10 trades."
"12312910","12314130"," You're going to say between the taxes. "
"12315430","12317150"," Between the taxes between the taxes."
"12317150","12318690"," The taxes, the one loss."
"12319890","12321430"," I didn't make that much money. "
"12322050","12324390"," I did a lot of work to make the money that I made."
"12325470","12327770"," Because you didn't take big heavy hitters like boom."
"12327910","12328630"," I made a hundred percent. "
"12328870","12328970"," Boom."
"12329090","12329810"," I made 300 percent."
"12331150","12332650"," You'll learn that though down the road. "
"12332810","12334610"," That's not free to be concerned with right now."
"12335170","12338250"," But this would be a closing remark for you to mark in your back of your brain."
"12338430","12339410"," Let it burn the back of your brain. "
"12341890","12345690"," That keep it simple with spreads."
"12345690","12350150"," You will likely come back to this years from now."
"12350990","12352870"," Not right now, but you will down the road. "
"12353090","12357330"," Like you figure like five, ten years, you'll be like, I remember that fucking guy told me to keep"
"12357330","12357770"," it simple."
"12359630","12362630"," You'll likely try to dumb down your trading, which is what I've done."
"12362710","12366150"," I've dumbed down my trading significantly. "
"12368050","12370510"," Not just trading, like all of it's been dumbed down."
"12370510","12376110"," The more that I complicated matters, the more money I lost, the more I hemorrhaged, the more"
"12376110","12377310"," accounts I blew up."
"12377890","12383360"," The more overthought things, the more I had problems. "
"12384580","12390020"," I would get these like holes of like, this must happen because of this X, Y, and Z."
"12391460","12393580"," Stock market must continue to go down."
"12393780","12395560"," Stock market must continue to go up."
"12397020","12398800"," Any of those like absolutes. "
"12400220","12405320"," So you'll learn that though in your trading journey, that there's no such thing as a bull or a"
"12405320","12405560"," bear."
"12405760","12410680"," There's no such thing as like the conviction trade."
"12411460","12414520"," I'm like, yeah, that conviction trade is good until it goes against you. "
"12415060","12417700"," And the moment that it goes against you, you cut your losses and run."
"12420970","12421810"," So there we go."
"12421930","12424310"," So on this stuff right here, I think that's all of it. "
"12424850","12428410"," You can always come back to this and review this stuff."
"12428410","12434490"," If you want more information, go to the Options Industry Council, go to the Discord, and meet up"
"12434490","12436350"," with those guys about that stuff."
"12437510","12441530"," If you're not interested in spreads, you're interested in futures, Globex. "
"12442170","12446910"," Inside the Discord, we have a whole entire room devoted to futures and Globex."
"12447110","12452810"," If you ever want to know why I'm awake on Twitter late at night time, because I'm trading Globex"
"12452810","12453430"," and Futures."
"12458410","12459770"," Yeah, that's another good one. "
"12459770","12463730"," So people are, if you guys have anything that you want to add to this, feel free."
"12463870","12464650"," I'm not going to get all this."
"12464770","12465690"," I'm winning this right now. "
"12465870","12469330"," So I haven't prepared like, I'm like, I'm going to write all this out and then I'm going to go"
"12469330","12471250"," check my data and make sure I'm correct."
"12472190","12473170"," This is off the cop."
"12473610","12475610"," So this is just stuff that I'm pulling out of my head. "
"12476530","12479430"," So if you guys have anything else that you want to put in the chat, put it in, as a"
"12479430","12480490"," matter of fact, crazy."
"12480630","12482710"," He just said, keep the count low."
"12483990","12489150"," I once had like 10 spreads and 10 different tickers and keeping track was an issue. "
"12489510","12493790"," I'm having that issue right now on my underlying holdings in the market."
"12497340","12500440"," I'm about to sell 451 and 455 here."
"12510700","12514520"," Now I have a sell order in on 451 and 455 C."
"12515480","12516600"," Now I'm just long spreads. "
"12525810","12526790"," My bad."
"12527250","12529310"," I apologize in that red bar."
"12544640","12546100"," There's a little bit more to go up here. "
"12548380","12550660"," I'm going to switch over down below to."
"12585200","12590480"," There's a little bit more room up here to squeeze higher is a little bit more right up in here."
"12595940","12597540"," That's what that red box is. "
"12635630","12639410"," It's just right up in here real danger as we come up in here wanting to see that."
"12639410","12646060"," If you're bullish above here."
"12647340","12649660"," You want to see price. "
"12650680","12652340"," Break above and hold."
"12654980","12656680"," 448 20."
"12658100","12680700"," It's like"
"12680700","12683800"," real danger danger danger danger danger. "
"12687540","12689120"," No more danger."
"12692630","12693810"," All this danger."
"12699560","12704320"," And to break above this stuff likely need help from down below. "
"12708490","12723200"," So you're likely going to need some kind"
"12723200","12724560"," of support down here."
"12727370","12729910"," Even consolidation down here to get up there."
"12731990","12734130"," Something like this to come up. "
"12734770","12736090"," So be really careful in here."
"12767480","12768920"," I got to really take a piss."
"12768920","12770160"," I just closed them in positions. "
"12770680","12773560"," I got to get P really quick at some point here."
"12776000","12823890"," So back"
"12823890","12824750"," on this stuff right here."
"12824990","12827250"," Really I'm going to take a potty break here in just a few moments. "
"12827470","12829110"," But just on this stuff right here."
"12830190","12834010"," If you if you someone was asking questions about someone said."
"12834710","12837590"," Is it sensible enter a call spread with a short leg is covered. "
"12837590","12840710"," I cannot sell naked calls with my current options approval level."
"12841510","12842790"," You need to reapply."
"12842790","12848550"," Well you need to reapply and some it's like some. "
"12849590","12851610"," Some brokers in a require margin account."
"12851610","12852970"," Some allow you to do it on a cash."
"12853430","12855790"," I think you're extended margin. "
"12856070","12858330"," I don't know if Robin Hood allows you to do it or not."
"12858470","12859950"," I don't know what Robin Hood does."
"12860210","12861610"," I don't I don't use Robin Hood. "
"12862190","12864390"," I don't use a Webull to trade."
"12864490","12866290"," So I don't know exactly what their rules are."
"12874480","12877000"," I don't think that the daily triggers right here. "
"12877460","12879040"," We're at the daily trigger right now."
"12883250","12884850"," We we're at the daily trigger."
"12885150","12886130"," Can we break above?"
"12886410","12886490"," Yeah. "
"12886850","12888210"," So the trade was down here."
"12888610","12889870"," I'm talking about something here."
"12891590","12894370"," So while you were panicking I was buying right. "
"12896150","12902050"," You see that like you were panicking I'm buying I'm putting risk on under high stress right."
"12903930","12909390"," So panic panic panic panic buying buying you're not buying you're not buying me come up here."
"12910770","12914110"," And the question becomes you don't think we're going up there. "
"12914310","12916090"," I don't fucking care if we're going up there."
"12916710","12924500"," I fucking care if we come up here and consolidate."
"12926480","12928580"," Because I'll take that trade right there. "
"12928820","12929460"," Does it make sense?"
"12929700","12931620"," Like this is the part of the trade that I care about."
"12934200","12935020"," You get what I'm saying?"
"12935020","12936080"," Like this is the part."
"12936480","12941960"," You could leave runners on here like 25% 10% runners here if you want. "
"12943360","12945500"," But whole position leaving here is insane."
"12946400","12947240"," You're insanity."
"12949220","12952120"," This is a this has a probability of winning. "
"12954780","12958880"," This has a probability of winning right this this first trade right now has a probability of"
"12958880","12965810"," winning of like 40% maybe 60 at most."
"12968190","12970590"," Maybe 60 if it wins."
"12971330","12975110"," There's also a reversal potential too. "
"12975110","12979450"," So let's say we squeeze up here immediately red bars down and you're fucked anyways."
"12979870","12981730"," You got that problem there too."
"12983690","12987130"," You can just what are you risking your whole account?"
"12988710","12995490"," Never would never would never risk my whole account for that bit right there. "
"12998290","12999020"," I wouldn't."
"12999380","13005480"," You can leave like 20% on 10% something like that of the trade not your account."
"13007700","13011900"," I've got call spreads but you know I need to see those. "
"13012140","13017280"," I need to see this here for continuation for call spreads for me to stay in call spreads."
"13020740","13022800"," You got a four trigger cluster right here."
"13024560","13026440"," That can easily reverse on you. "
"13026580","13028040"," So no I personally know."
"13029960","13033260"," You take the money here if you're if you were in down here you take the money."
"13033420","13034740"," So if you're if you're in down here. "
"13035700","13036700"," Take the money off."
"13037940","13041000"," You take the risk off the market you realize profit and look for another entry."
"13041680","13044280"," Matter of fact I got a green box down here just in case we roll. "
"13057660","13058560"," Then can we go up there?"
"13058740","13061440"," Yeah, but it's super risky."
"13063300","13072300"," Like if you're if you're waiting for all of this to take that trade seems kind of seems kind of"
"13072300","13072700"," dangerous."
"13072700","13079260"," I think if you ran that trade like 10 times or something. "
"13083000","13085460"," And you wouldn't even be like a normal loser."
"13085720","13088280"," You'd be like just I just blew up 80% of my trade."
"13089080","13090360"," Let's look at it right now. "
"13099430","13103530"," So four forty-eighths right now for today are forty eight cents."
"13106510","13108110"," Now forty six cents."
"13108450","13110710"," Okay, so hold on a second. "
"13113430","13114130"," I don't know."
"13114270","13115450"," I don't know if we're going to squeeze through."
"13115450","13120050"," It's just potential to but let's just look at the trade the mechanics of the trade. "
"13122120","13124120"," Four forty eight seed just a moment ago."
"13126580","13149660"," Was forty eight cents right back"
"13149660","13149980"," here."
"13157910","13163450"," I guess if you're going to take this trade you'd need it to be put a predetermined limit cell on"
"13163450","13163570"," it. "
"13165370","13174840"," So what do you think they print sixty cents maybe if you're looking for this trade right here."
"13180600","13184880"," I'd probably put a predetermined limit cell on them."
"13185820","13189280"," Like sixty cents or something or fifty five cents. "
"13189460","13191140"," So they actually close when you want them to close."
"13194300","13198920"," Like if you want these two clothes you probably have to set it like sell at sixty."
"13201830","13205310"," They're currently trading forty two cents right now. "
"13214700","13216800"," Twenty seven EMA is on your side right now."
"13216860","13217480"," It's very vertical."
"13217780","13218220"," It's very nice. "
"13218220","13218920"," I like this."
"13219140","13222720"," See in this trade is not dead until we break that."
"13224220","13227960"," So until we break this white line right here, trade is still alive. "
"13228300","13230540"," This trade right here is still alive believe it or not."
"13235260","13235500"," Right."
"13235780","13238920"," So where do you put your stops in this trade right now?"
"13240740","13250060"," You put your stops right here closing bars below this. "
"13253970","13259770"," You'd likely get one more chance to get out like you trade down and trade up at a failure right"
"13259770","13260010"," there."
"13265360","13267140"," So you'd have an exit point right here."
"13285020","13290920"," So your stops are over here but only after it bleeds down. "
"13291160","13291300"," Okay."
"13293540","13294860"," You'd still get one more chance."
"13296600","13297280"," Make sense?"
"13302370","13304690"," Four forty eight C's back to forty eight cents. "
"13306110","13311290"," Let me know what you think the price of forty eight cents will be right up here."
"13312950","13317570"," What do you think those forty eight C's will be these ones?"
"13318750","13320970"," I think they'll be worth sixty cents."
"13322290","13323770"," Maybe squeeze up there. "
"13324850","13325970"," Maybe sixty five."
"13336220","13338800"," Here I'll draw in where your stop would be."
"13341270","13342610"," So the trade is still alive. "
"13348780","13349640"," There's something like that."
"13355380","13360840"," Unless you break the white line and then reject here."
"13365750","13367050"," What are they trading right now?"
"13368110","13369130"," This is a big question. "
"13369470","13370310"," What are they trading right now?"
"13371010","13371990"," Forty eight cents, right?"
"13372830","13375190"," It's still trading forty eight cents right now, right?"
"13386590","13387970"," What are they trading right now?"
"13388110","13388750"," Forty eight cents."
"13394350","13397710"," So the risk that you're putting on for like you need to free to pay day."
"13404930","13412540"," Now trading forty three cents for forty eight C's. "
"13429240","13435320"," Just had a price check down below on the twenty seven EMA."
"13436800","13438880"," No break below though, just a price check."
"13440970","13442030"," See that right there?"
"13442330","13443290"," Just a price check. "
"13443490","13444130"," That's all it was."
"13446680","13447440"," See it right there?"
"13447600","13448200"," How tagged it perfectly?"
"13451960","13452780"," No break below yet."
"13457100","13458500"," It's still alive if you're in calls. "
"13459800","13462100"," If you're in four forty eight C's, you're still alive right now."
"13469490","13473450"," Trading forty seven cents just had a shit ton of calls coming to the market."
"13474310","13482130"," Seven hundred thousand zero dates just came in the market on four forty eight C and four forty nine"
"13482130","13482490"," C."
"13484010","13488810"," Seven hundred thousand zero dates just came in and split between both of those strikes. "
"13499060","13501620"," Four forty eight C's trading forty one cents right now."
"13537830","13539930"," Trading forty cents right now on four forty eight."
"13540050","13541550"," I'm not in these calls. "
"13543230","13544530"," I think it's too risky."
"13544530","13550450"," I don't think the payoff is good enough, but I think we come back down here to the green box."
"13558190","13558910"," I can be wrong. "
"13560290","13561470"," We can go up there right now."
"13561630","13564130"," I just don't think the risk versus reward is worth it."
"13564390","13567930"," So it's not for me. "
"13570410","13570770"," All right."
"13570870","13571470"," I'll go potty right now."
"13571550","13572430"," You guys want some green bars. "
"13572450","13573110"," I'll go potty."
"13573510","13574150"," I'll be right back."
"13805790","13806310"," All right. "
"13806370","13806570"," I'm back."
"13806710","13807030"," That was quick."
"13812250","13814490"," Somebody here's my question to you now. "
"13819200","13822000"," Now done this pin strike right here."
"13822100","13822560"," Let me know."
"13826180","13828320"," See that that candle right there. "
"13828480","13830400"," Are you going to stop yourself out here?"
"13830760","13833060"," Or did you stop yourself out down here?"
"13855350","13857130"," Did you take the stops here?"
"13857850","13859530"," Did you take the stop up here?"
"13860270","13863150"," Are you going to hold here because you think it's coming back?"
"13865450","13866650"," Let me know in the chat."
"13869630","13873690"," Did you get stopped out because of your capitulation down here?"
"13874750","13877470"," Did you DCA or position down here?"
"13883890","13885910"," I got some wonky shit going on here."
"13893540","13898440"," Like so if you're 48 C's or 48 cents, right?"
"13901870","13904090"," I got Alexa pulling bullshit. "
"13905010","13908990"," As you're getting squeezed down here, did you DCA?"
"13910850","13912930"," So that's not stops, is it?"
"13915670","13917750"," Did you DCA down here?"
"13922800","13925440"," Did you DCA 48 cents?"
"13931240","13934340"," So that you could then take your stops right here?"
"13935600","13937980"," Or are you just DCAing along here?"
"13941180","13942520"," You're watching all this."
"13942780","13946500"," So 48 C was 48 cents, rolls down."
"13950190","13954050"," I'm assuming that a lot of people will get stopped right here. "
"13954710","13955570"," Be like a moat."
"13957950","13960630"," Or did you, or did you DCA instead?"
"13964740","13968500"," And then as we train it up here, you unfuck yourself."
"13973440","13981240"," Or did you DCA down here and you're hoping for a return to greatness over here?"
"13984680","13992950"," Moon stars and the sun, when moon, when sun, when mars. "
"13995850","13997770"," So do you see how all this works here?"
"14004340","14007020"," So this would be more like DCA, right?"
"14008560","14024300"," Maybe rewrite"
"14024300","14025320"," that, DCA."
"14026900","14045930"," Trade in"
"14045930","14050490"," 41 cents on 448 C for 48 cents up here."
"14052270","14054770"," So now you're down here, right?"
"14056570","14061770"," You should have DCA'd when you're panicking. "
"14061770","14069210"," And then as we come up here, you make a decision to get out or stay long,"
"14069610","14072190"," right?"
"14072330","14080750"," You stop yourself out in reposition or you look towards the previous high, right?"
"14081030","14083490"," Which is 44786 up here, right?"
"14084810","14089810"," So if you're like, I'm going to stay in that trade cap by DCA down here."
"14091010","14094710"," As we came up to where I actually wanted to exit, I stayed in."
"14095550","14099450"," So where's your next place to get out of your bad trade?"
"14099970","14100630"," Above, right?"
"14101590","14102270"," A failure?"
"14105230","14107050"," Trade in 40 cents right now. "
"14126950","14136940"," I want you to also"
"14136940","14140060"," remember everything that's happening in here, right?"
"14142300","14144740"," 48 cents, DCA to the downside."
"14146000","14148220"," Do I do stops or no stops?"
"14148360","14149280"," Can I get up?"
"14149480","14151380"," We have a failure of a new high right here."
"14159540","14162280"," All for 65 cents on 48. "
"14167760","14169940"," Trade in 33 cents right now."
"14177100","14177620"," 34."
"14188720","14190780"," A lot of movement price in here, huh?"
"14190780","14191780"," 48, 34. "
"14198230","14199530"," Here in here, isn't it?"
"14199870","14205990"," It's like kind of like inducing panic along the way, right?"
"14206650","14208070"," 48 cents, 33."
"14208830","14209810"," Where does it go next?"
"14210850","14213270"," You're watching this green box down here."
"14213830","14215670"," People talk to you about liquidation breaks. "
"14220110","14223630"," And you got some cheap guy down here just hoping that you get down here."
"14223670","14224630"," It's like, please, come on down."
"14225270","14226290"," Come on down here. "
"14226290","14229230"," Some of these cheap calls, this person's in up here at 48 cents."
"14229470","14230430"," Sell me for like 10 cents."
"14233410","14236390"," I don't know if we get down there, but that's what I'm hoping for. "
"14247460","14248940"," There's a stink bid down here."
"14264970","14265930"," You got it, Cheever."
"14273080","14274840"," The sweating would be real here, right?"
"14275220","14278260"," Let's look at this as a thought experiment. "
"14280320","14282080"," Trade in 30 cents right now."
"14282640","14284840"," You're at 48 cents up here."
"14285060","14288000"," You're hoping for 65 cents up above. "
"14305190","14308910"," Put that up there, the hope for 65 cents."
"14311670","14314490"," We'll even put the high side instead of 60, we'll say 65."
"14319230","14320510"," Trade in 31 right now. "
"14323240","14325080"," We can change this at that point, right?"
"14325200","14326040"," It's now not 65."
"14326500","14327960"," It's now probably 55, right?"
"14329240","14330860"," We got 30 cent calls down here."
"14331140","14340500"," Whatever that was, whatever this hope, whatever this hope on 48 was, what's happening right now?"
"14342120","14343840"," They're reprising the option, right?"
"14344440","14345300"," You can see it, right?"
"14347730","14348510"," Why is that?"
"14348650","14349710"," Do you know why that is?"
"14352310","14353770"," Anybody want to tell me what that is?"
"14353970","14354950"," What's that what that's called?"
"14359280","14360640"," It's option interest, right?"
"14362060","14363160"," It's OI, right?"
"14364260","14366380"," You get everybody in the trade right here. "
"14368500","14369960"," Everybody's taking the money and running."
"14373320","14375500"," Even if price continues higher."
"14377710","14379190"," Guess who's in this trade?"
"14382680","14392250"," Not as many people as you. "
"14398370","14401390"," It's option interest getting burned right now, right?"
"14403920","14404760"," Do I think it was up there?"
"14404880","14406420"," I do, but I think you need support."
"14406620","14407980"," I think you need some time here to get up there."
"14408120","14432200"," But he had"
"14432200","14432800"," nampay. "
"14433180","14434700"," He had Steelers, right?"
"14435580","14438200"," They're like, well, we had so many people in that first trade."
"14438200","14440840"," Now we've got, I don't know, a fucking quarter of them."
"14443060","14446320"," We're going to kill these fucking calls because we're closing the day out. "
"14446800","14448260"," Thanks for playing the down move."
"14448440","14449620"," Thanks for playing the up move."
"14451860","14452620"," Will we go there?"
"14452780","14452940"," Sure. "
"14453200","14455640"," We're paying $1.50, probably not."
"14456740","14458720"," We'll put them in the money right at the bell here."
"14458940","14469850"," It'll be $0.02. I"
"14469850","14474150"," took Friday calls yesterday, so yesterday into the bell. "
"14474150","14478370"," So not just about a whole day."
"14480130","14482770"," I was in and out of zero dates."
"14485080","14486380"," Sorry, I'll explain it better here. "
"14486620","14486980"," Hold on a second."
"14496090","14496770"," So ready?"
"14502680","14503560"," Zero dates."
"14511100","14512920"," I took one dates right here. "
"14518680","14519940"," We traded up here."
"14520320","14521480"," I took the money and ran."
"14524570","14524670"," Right?"
"14529050","14534350"," And then I was thinking, I'd like to get more one dates for this PT up here. "
"14535310","14536530"," We got left behind."
"14537650","14541090"," So I said, ah, if we ever come back down here, I'll get some one dates."
"14541430","14541930"," We didn't. "
"14544730","14550560"," But I did put some weeklies on for over there."
"14550760","14551080"," Why?"
"14555540","14558020"," The main reason was this cross yesterday."
"14558340","14559760"," Remember we talked about this cross yesterday?"
"14560400","14567160"," Remember we got the confirmation trade here and I said, we're either going to get an upside move to"
"14568790","14571610"," this today, tomorrow, or the next day. "
"14571770","14571870"," Right?"
"14571870","14573010"," What did they do?"
"14573170","14574670"," They sent us up there right here."
"14574830","14574910"," Boom."
"14575850","14577030"," Tagged it right there. "
"14578130","14581970"," Came back down right in a pre-market."
"14584870","14586110"," You got your first target."
"14586330","14587150"," First target hit. "
"14591200","14592000"," City timing, right?"
"14594060","14594640"," City timing, right?"
"14595260","14597240"," Blasted right back down here."
"14597640","14598220"," And what happened?"
"14599000","14600380"," Buyer's still here, right?"
"14603240","14604440"," Buyer's still here."
"14604440","14605840"," Bleeding off Apple. "
"14606680","14608280"," Bounce right back up here."
"14610000","14611920"," So what's the trade here?"
"14613700","14615500"," I've got weeklies over here."
"14619480","14619820"," Right?"
"14620020","14621820"," Into this close, I've got weeklies for Friday. "
"14622580","14624300"," We start sending it down over here."
"14625880","14627920"," I haven't sold weekly, still on them."
"14628720","14633040"," So I'm adding a weekly position down here, 451s, 455s. "
"14633040","14634980"," This position right here."
"14637060","14638440"," Adding to it down here."
"14643300","14646420"," To get up and over right to the next price target. "
"14646600","14647440"," Where's the next price target?"
"14647640","14647860"," Do you know?"
"14649890","14651390"," We know where it is, right?"
"14651750","14652130"," It's up here."
"14653330","14655550"," It's a 452, 454."
"14656230","14659050"," And then on Friday, it's 456, right?"
"14660190","14665310"," So we're talking about taking 455Cs for Friday, right?"
"14669740","14672120"," So yesterday we said first target here. "
"14673480","14675820"," Second target's going to be off the daily and hourly."
"14676460","14677700"," It's going to be right here."
"14680150","14680410"," Right?"
"14680650","14682130"," Third target's going to be right here. "
"14683850","14685670"," 1, 2, 3."
"14686170","14687750"," What we don't want to see is what?"
"14688630","14689890"," Don't want to see this, do we?"
"14691630","14694570"," Don't want to see this, do we?"
"14694850","14696170"," Squeeze this up in the overnight."
"14696490","14697550"," Start selling it down again."
"14697850","14698710"," Pull shit like that. "
"14700230","14701730"," And then that move here."
"14703250","14705170"," You see how all this overnight?"
"14705350","14706090"," Bullshit in here."
"14706450","14707630"," This is bullshit, man. "
"14708250","14710750"," This shit here is pissing me off to no end."
"14713970","14715530"," Keeping me up every single night."
"14717840","14719260"," Keep me awake every single night. "
"14722680","14725440"," So now that we're in here, what's the next target, right?"
"14726900","14728640"," So what are we trying to do here?"
"14729660","14730920"," Do you guys all know?"
"14736440","14739260"," So your next upside target for spoons."
"14742600","14744320"," I guess I gave the dates wrong."
"14744320","14746020"," You have one, two, three more dates for this. "
"14746760","14748740"," So what's the next move for spoons, right?"
"14751060","14754280"," The next target for spoons on the upside is right here, right?"
"14760720","14762820"," And what do bulls need to do to get up there?"
"14765000","14766940"," Need a break above these sellers, right?"
"14771650","14773230"," So I got a recovery trade here."
"14775010","14776330"," And what do I want to see?"
"14776430","14780470"," I want to see some kind of grinding down and move higher in these next two days, right?"
"14783660","14784560"," First target hit."
"14808640","14810820"," What do I just need to see happen here?"
"14814350","14816070"," If you already tagged this one, right?"
"14816470","14816910"," See it?"
"14818150","14819170"," Tagged it right there. "
"14825860","14826860"," Where's the next one?"
"14832020","14832820"," It's over here, right?"
"14833780","14834620"," It'll be a little bit lower."
"14835800","14837260"," You like right about there."
"14844410","14847430"," Let me give a little bit more conservative. "
"14850440","14850940"," 4221."
"14855400","14856680"," Take that one out right there."
"14863840","14864940"," Move this over here, right?"
"14868010","14869650"," Trade that bounce back down here. "
"14869930","14871230"," Get up there for next for Friday."
"14871230","14888570"," Back to"
"14888570","14890110"," 48 cents right now."
"14894970","14898170"," So 448C was at 48 cents. "
"14909090","14910950"," I'm going to move this down just so we can see it."
"14915820","14918900"," Remember, these calls are 48 cents right here."
"14920420","14924000"," So this trader right here is breakeven right now. "
"14931300","14932820"," He's up a penny right now."
"14943080","14944160"," I don't know if that's showing up well."
"14961060","14962780"," Trade in 52 cents. "
"14962980","14966420"," We talked about having what on the trade, right?"
"14966420","14970400"," A limit sell already set, right?"
"14971080","14971960"," 65 cents."
"14973300","14975460"," Trade in 52 cents right now."
"14982490","14984490"," Trade in above the daily trigger. "
"14993860","14996080"," Trade in 52 in the money right now."
"15015160","15017520"," Now we're going to watch the entire trade from start to finish."
"15018520","15020300"," That's what we're trying to do is watch the entire trade. "
"15022810","15024730"," Like, would you have gotten stopped out down here?"
"15024870","15025930"," Would you have panicked down here?"
"15026090","15030090"," Would you have actually DC'd aid and then considered a stop here?"
"15030090","15031750"," Would you have DC'd aid here?"
"15033730","15036190"," Originally, we're at 48 cents right here."
"15036790","15041390"," Originally, we're hoping for 65, setting a limit sell above for 65."
"15042990","15045030"," Trade in 55 cents right now. "
"15051790","15053530"," This is where I wanted to buy in down here."
"15063070","15065310"," Up six pennies on this trade right here."
"15079420","15080500"," Not worried at all. "
"15088060","15089340"," No worries at all here."
"15091990","15093830"," I'm going to show you guys something right now, okay?"
"15098180","15113460"," Spy has stayed on its daily trigger since August"
"15113460","15114360"," 3rd."
"15117340","15118580"," This is the daily trigger right here. "
"15119580","15122020"," And the daily trigger has been going up the entire way."
"15123620","15126680"," 64 cents on that green bar right here."
"15128840","15131360"," 64 cents on that tick right there. "
"15135610","15136590"," It's pretty close, right?"
"15139230","15140850"," 64 cents right here."
"15149300","15150740"," 65 cents."
"15152560","15156840"," So if you had a predetermined limit sell, you would have sold at 65. "
"15157820","15159840"," Not trading 67 cents."
"15160300","15161980"," 68 cents right now."
"15162780","15164160"," 448 C."
"15168190","15170870"," 700,000 calls came into the market. "
"15172190","15173210"," Right here."
"15174250","15177210"," 700,000 calls right there came into the market."
"15190020","15192560"," So am I scared about lower lows?"
"15192960","15193480"," No, I'm not. "
"15194420","15199060"," The only thing that I'm scared about is the daily trigger breaking."
"15199360","15203000"," As long as the only trigger doesn't break, we're going up."
"15203380","15208570"," So trading 70 cents on the squeeze. "
"15212890","15215190"," Still long call spreads right now."
"15216310","15217970"," So now what am I looking for here?"
"15220210","15223490"," I want to see the break above in the consolidation, right?"
"15226220","15228340"," So that I can target this upside move."
"15232790","15235130"," What do I not want to see here?"
"15242040","15243440"," A full reversal, right?"
"15243540","15245300"," I don't want to see a full reversal here. "
"15246400","15248620"," I don't want to see a bloodbath or any kind."
"15249220","15258810"," I want to see this hold right here so that I can enter some Friday calls"
"15258810","15262550"," for 45221."
"15286260","15287940"," Yeah, no, I'm not worried at all. "
"15287940","15289040"," I have like no."
"15289780","15299720"," I had a little bit of fear and I think last week, like last Sunday I did a"
"15299720","15300020"," video."
"15302260","15305240"," Last Sunday night, not this past Sunday, but the Sunday before. "
"15306420","15313400"," I did a video on late night video on discord where I was like, you might wake up in the"
"15313400","15314100"," next week or two."
"15315180","15317600"," Like down at 440 down at 430."
"15321770","15323390"," I was like, don't be scared. "
"15325660","15336300"," And then, of course, this past week, I'm internally not quite scared, but more"
"15336300","15337040"," trying to control."
"15337400","15342120"," I've got a lot of money in the market on the underlying."
"15346400","15348560"," This is spyplex, by the way, I'm talking to him. "
"15351100","15352920"," And the daily trigger is not broken."
"15352920","15358320"," And not only is it not broken, it's going up regardless of price."
"15361520","15364960"," So what that's telling me is that any pullbacks are rebot. "
"15366280","15367800"," Many and all pullbacks you buy."
"15369160","15374320"," The thumbnail in today's video shows what I think."
"15374780","15376960"," I'm trying to maximize profit in this market. "
"15378460","15381320"," So, no, I'm not fearful in any way, shape or form."
"15381560","15383220"," I got zero fear in this market right now."
"15383220","15383720"," Zero. "
"15384420","15391440"," I've got internal things I have to deal with."
"15391640","15394640"," But those are my own emotions and stuff like that."
"15396910","15405040"," Trade in 78 right now on 448c. "
"15405460","15406100"," I'm not in that trade."
"15426240","15429120"," But yes, spyplex, I'm not bearish in any way here, man."
"15429480","15429800"," Like none. "
"15430340","15430880"," Like zero."
"15431640","15435460"," I've got my own internal shit I've got to deal with, which I think I've dealt with at this point."
"15435460","15441300"," But I'm on like all-time highs, like all-time eyes. "
"15442600","15446420"," Maximize profits, slam that shit, slam that sell button on the high."
"15447540","15450500"," On all-time highs and add wherever I can."
"15450760","15452520"," Add the daily trigger, add the weekly trigger. "
"15455420","15457040"," And look for all-time eyes."
"15457580","15459320"," I have not changed any of that thesis."
"15460360","15460520"," Zero. "
"15467180","15467740"," Nothing says crash."
"15467740","15471460"," Nothing says trade is over."
"15471640","15473080"," I don't care what anyone says either. "
"15473520","15474100"," Like YouTube."
"15474740","15475880"," I don't care what people say on YouTube."
"15476060","15477360"," I don't care what people say on Twitter. "
"15478620","15480080"," I don't care what people are saying."
"15480200","15480780"," I just don't."
"15481200","15485100"," I've done enough research on this stuff to know that they're wrong. "
"15485380","15488080"," So I know they're wrong."
"15488940","15490340"," I don't even think they're wrong."
"15490480","15491600"," I even have a feeling that they're wrong. "
"15491740","15492500"," I know they're wrong."
"15497350","15497870"," I know 100%."
"15498430","15500750"," There's like a 5% chance that they're right. "
"15500750","15503710"," Like 5%."
"15503710","15504190"," At best."
"15506090","15506750"," At best. "
"15507850","15509050"," That's what they have that they're right."
"15510310","15511650"," I have an edge in the market."
"15511970","15513430"," So I don't know. "
"15513830","15516510"," The self-doubt of that, though, of course, always creeps in."
"15517190","15518870"," That's the part that's like..."
"15519450","15520650"," It's the part that's always..."
"15520650","15521570"," It always now is that."
"15521710","15522490"," It never matters. "
"15522850","15523890"," It's always there in the background."
"15529410","15530310"," But I know they're wrong."
"15531390","15532430"," They've been wrong every time. "
"15532590","15536170"," They're wrong in May, they're wrong in October, they're wrong in October of last year."
"15536230","15537450"," They're wrong in December of last year."
"15537710","15539310"," They're wrong in September of last year. "
"15539910","15541330"," They're wrong all in 2021."
"15543270","15544130"," They're wrong in 2020."
"15546750","15550560"," I'm always wrong, dude. "
"15551080","15555640"," I'm assuming that their motivations are different than what they say."
"15557080","15557960"," It's either one."
"15558120","15562460"," If either lies or motivations are for something lesser. "
"15563120","15569640"," Most sellers that I know, like most actual sell-side guys that I know, they don't drink that Kool "
"15569640","15569820","-Aid."
"15570800","15572400"," They don't push any of that stuff."
"15573180","15579160"," They trade the sells because they're good at selling, but their thesis has nothing to do with like,"
"15579160","15580060"," this is the top. "
"15583560","15588780"," Like the real traders that sell that I know, like my friends, they're not talking about that at"
"15588780","15588940"," all."
"15593990","15594450"," I think the..."
"15594450","15595390"," I think the..."
"15595390","15598190"," It's the same as like why does somebody tell you something?"
"15599050","15600330"," What are their motivations?"
"15600910","15601410"," That kind of stuff."
"15605950","15607070"," It has to be. "
"15607930","15608830"," So I don't know."
"15609050","15611090"," So my own personal take here, nothing's changed."
"15611890","15612430"," If you guys..."
"15612430","15615190"," So the original video had..."
"15616070","15616450"," Ready for this?"
"15617490","15619290"," Only 70 people showed up. "
"15620670","15621130"," 70."
"15625670","15628950"," As the roll started though, it's got thousands of views now."
"15629210","15629830"," It's a private video. "
"15630350","15631170"," It's not even a public video."
"15631630","15631990"," It's private."
"15632270","15633290"," You have to have an invitation link. "
"15634230","15635670"," You have to have an invite to it."
"15635670","15639430"," It's got thousands now though."
"15643830","15644390"," Right?"
"15644790","15652050"," So now that video has thousands, and I'm sure that I'm the smallest voice in the room saying, uh,"
"15652250","15659390"," bitey's dips, and I'm sure in three or four weeks, or when it all goes back up again, uh, that"
"15659390","15661790"," there'll be thousands of people going. "
"15662090","15663550"," I bought that dip down there."
"15664450","15666110"," I bought that daily trigger."
"15666870","15667590"," You fucking liar. "
"15670240","15676050"," Yeah, the Twitter engagement thing is brutal."
"15676770","15678290"," I am not on there a lot anymore."
"15678610","15679930"," I'm doing a lot of shit posts in there. "
"15680310","15684450"," Actually, I have somebody managing that account for me, or people managing that account for me."
"15684870","15691970"," And at some point, I have one more person, at least, that I'm trying to get to manage that account."
"15692650","15697890"," Um, so it gets more professional, because I can't do Twitter right now. "
"15698050","15699330"," It's blowing my mind."
"15702010","15703830"," The engagement shit is wild."
"15704590","15710850"," Uh, I've had that explained to me in detail at this point, uh, from people that are doing it. "
"15712070","15713990"," And it's blowing my mind to engage."
"15714510","15718150"," Like, the one of the worst I thought I thought was like, oh, this is kind of cool."
"15718230","15718630"," They're going to pay. "
"15718790","15721670"," Well, I was like, uh, oh, I should have back up."
"15722590","15724170"," Originally, I'm like, fuck no."
"15725270","15732790"," I was like, when they start to monetize Twitter, uh, you're trapped in their, um, garden, like you"
"15732790","15733250"," are trapped. "
"15734690","15738110"," I know that sounds crazy, but you're trapped in their garden."
"15738110","15743390"," And it's a very, it's something that I'm not going to have no interest in, uh, being trapped in the"
"15743390","15743910"," Twitter garden."
"15744430","15748630"," If you get canceled for anything in Twitter, uh, if they don't like you, they don't like your"
"15748630","15748870"," handle. "
"15749030","15752010"," Like one guy with the, uh, uh, ad music, they took his handle away, right?"
"15752930","15755730"," Uh, yesterday or something, they just, uh, uh, took it."
"15755730","15757410"," They needed it for, uh, for X."
"15759950","15763030"," Um, so they took his handle away."
"15763430","15765010"," Uh, like, you know, snap your finger. "
"15765170","15765450"," It's gone."
"15767880","15769580"," And, uh, you're trapped in that garden."
"15769580","15770240"," It's really bad. "
"15770620","15772360"," Now, initially you get paid, right?"
"15772500","15772840"," A lot of money."
"15773000","15775840"," You're like, ooh, making all this money, uh, for engagement."
"15776360","15780480"," I didn't see the secondary, uh, problem with it. "
"15781080","15785420"," And that's what a lot of my friends are telling me is that, uh, uh, hey, man, we can, you"
"15785420","15793320"," know what we can do is if you, uh, if you hire somebody to basically, if I hire somebody and"
"15793320","15799940"," say, create posts that look like this, I'm going to get a lot more engagement and get a ton of"
"15799940","15805080"," followers and, um, it's not real anymore."
"15806440","15809660"," There's like even more fakeness to the already fakeness of Twitter."
"15810340","15812320"," Uh, it's even worse. "
"15813720","15817300"," I didn't think it could become worse, but, uh, it is."
"15824760","15829580"," Uh, I've got a, uh, I've got a, um, I filed a, my attorneys are already fired, filed for at"
"15829580","15830540"," Captain Jim James."
"15832100","15835760"," So I've got trademarks coming out and, uh, copyrights and all this other stuff. "
"15836280","15838280"," I've got attorneys, uh, working on it right now."
"15838820","15840760"," Let's actually get that handle, Captain Jim James."
"15843360","15845980"," We, we're already in the process of doing that right now. "
"15847710","15849010"," It just takes time, man."
"15849090","15850190"," All this shit takes time."
"15852390","15853830"," Like, we want it done, like, right?"
"15853970","15854850"," We're trading one minute charts. "
"15854950","15857210"," We want everything on, on, like, on, like, right now."
"15876000","15877060"," Uh, no, I want to see more."
"15877680","15878540"," Uh, I'm on call spread. "
"15878560","15879040"," Still there."
"15879200","15880400"," This is all good positive to see."
"15881160","15882800"," I want to see all this stuff come up. "
"15883060","15885380"," It's, we're forming a four trigger, uh, bull cluster."
"15885760","15886260"," So we'll see."
"15891090","15891350"," We're forming. "
"15891530","15892110"," I want to see a test."
"15892550","15893690"," I want to see a real test here."
"15899620","15900800"," I'm interested in some zero dates. "
"15903460","15908040"," I'm trying to give you guys more of an insight into my brain and how it works and I'm trading."
"15923060","15924520"," There's the daily trigger right there."
"15925300","15926580"," Get that over there so you can see it. "
"15928120","15930700"," Get rid of that because it is interfering."
"15932220","15934540"," I'm going to leave the wolves up right there."
"15935540","15952020"," There's the hoping for 65 cents target above"
"15952020","15953260"," 451 20. "
"15953260","15958740"," I have another target above of 450 to 34."
"15960740","15962300"," Um, oh, Thursday."
"15968050","15969610"," No active zero dates right now. "
"15984920","15986760"," Uh, I sent him."
"15986900","15991120"," I tried to contact him and then, uh, he tried to contact me and then the admin sold me to"
"15991120","15994820"," re-contact him again or something to get the Captain Jim James handle."
"15995420","15999660"," I still didn't find it in my DMS. So I have to look through."
"15999660","16005440"," So I want you guys to know that, like, I want you guys to know that my phone rings all"
"16005440","16005880"," day long."
"16006380","16008980"," It gets text messages all day long. "
"16009540","16011560"," Gets text messages all night long."
"16011880","16014180"," I mean, all night, like one, two, three o'clock in the morning."
"16014980","16016140"," Even now with the new phone number. "
"16016960","16018240"," Um, my emails."
"16018760","16023060"," I have four or five email addresses dedicated to what we do here."
"16023780","16026680"," Uh, this is like, this is like behind the scenes stuff, right?"
"16026680","16030780"," Uh, I get maybe a hundred emails a day. "
"16031320","16035240"," Uh, then I also get DMS on three different handles."
"16036400","16039120"," Uh, right around 25 to 100 a day."
"16039900","16044100"," Uh, on DMS on Discord, I get about five to ten a day. "
"16045140","16052440"," Uh, so I could spend, uh, hours every day responding to that stuff."
"16052440","16056660"," Uh, ooh, yeah, they both squeeze all these wolves out right now."
"16057700","16058760"," Let's start seeing it. "
"16058860","16060340"," Oh, this is a relic from yesterday."
"16061200","16062280"," It was the price target."
"16063780","16067100"," Wolves are about to get squeezed hard and heavy here. "
"16067880","16069860"," Big green bars coming here."
"16077460","16079540"," I'll give you some targets to the upside here."
"16080580","16082560"," You're breaking through one right now. "
"16085140","16086720"," It's gonna cause a giant squeeze."
"16089830","16090790"," Got another one right there."
"16097450","16098910"," Another one right there. "
"16105340","16106780"," Another one right there."
"16111130","16112970"," There's some big ball right there."
"16117380","16119700"," And then there's the upper upside target right there. "
"16126790","16128770"," So you can bring this over so you can see it all."
"16136560","16138140"," Maybe you can see that right there."
"16142040","16144580"," Uh, so yeah, I'm trying to get my handle on DM2. "
"16144760","16147080"," So someone took my handle on Discord."
"16147500","16150320"," No, uh, friend took the handle on Discord for me."
"16150600","16157040"," Uh, because as they were releasing handles, uh, nefarious people were grabbing them. "
"16157440","16159260"," So like, let's say you have a famous Discord."
"16160900","16165340"," As that handle would be released, uh, Scammers would grab those handles."
"16166140","16174540"," Uh, thankfully a friend in Discord, thankfully a friend in Discord grabbed my handle as it was"
"16174540","16174820"," released. "
"16175700","16179820"," Uh, like the day it came out, they grabbed it for me."
"16179920","16181540"," So they're trying to get me my handle on Discord."
"16181540","16187460"," And I actually have to file or my attorney says that he might have already done it. "
"16187740","16192260"," Said he had to file a, uh, trademarks and copyrights and then submit it to Twitter."
"16192480","16194500"," And then Twitter comes back and gets me the Twitter handle."
"16194840","16198560"," Because the Twitter handle has been dead for like 10 years or something. "
"16200680","16202780"," Trading $4.48.86 right now."
"16203760","16210160"," $4.48 trading 100% trade right now at $1.04 right now."
"16217920","16219660"," Move that over so you can see it. "
"16226460","16228800"," I do want to talk to you about something else here."
"16228860","16229800"," We're going to have a quick conversation."
"16230500","16232080"," You're going to get this in a white paper. "
"16232740","16235340"," We're going to talk about it right now because it's a good thing to talk about."
"16236820","16241140"," Uh, it's a good, it's a, not a good thing, but hold on a second here."
"16243160","16244420"," We're going to have a chat here. "
"16245680","16247920"," That was a paying attention moment."
"16251890","16252750"," No, not that."
"16255170","16260750"," So, uh, I want you to realize something here that I want you to see something here. "
"16260830","16260990"," Okay."
"16268750","16271890"," When a price breaks above a cluster."
"16273850","16276530"," It needs to hold on a retest. "
"16277790","16278510"," Okay."
"16279630","16284470"," So behaviors are that when you come above a cluster or below a cluster."
"16285350","16287250"," You'll have cells or buys. "
"16287850","16287910"," Okay."
"16288270","16290310"," So let's say you have a bear cluster here."
"16291890","16295290"," And price begins to reject and it comes down, right?"
"16296610","16302010"," You want to confirm for the continuation to the downside confirmed. "
"16302290","16302910"," You see that?"
"16303590","16304390"," You get that concept?"
"16305330","16307330"," Confirm for continuation of the downside."
"16310900","16314780"," Uh, you'll get the squeezes down or up."
"16314780","16315440"," Doesn't matter. "
"16315580","16318580"," Here's the squeeze up on the upside, right?"
"16319100","16320420"," Here's where it didn't hold."
"16321700","16324220"," Came down, but didn't hold, did it?"
"16324940","16329140"," Came down, didn't hold for continuation of the downside, right?"
"16331790","16334810"," So where price is right now on spy?"
"16338780","16341520"," So where price is right here right now?"
"16342560","16344920"," There's two things you're looking for."
"16345140","16345260"," Okay. "
"16346800","16350620"," You're looking for consolidation is the best thing to see."
"16351360","16354760"," The longer we spend here, the more powerful the move up is."
"16357560","16358280"," Okay. "
"16360320","16365520"," The more explosive the move is, the more likely it doesn't hold."
"16368320","16369700"," So a bull cluster."
"16371120","16372880"," The more explosive the move. "
"16374000","16376040"," The less chance of it holding."
"16379370","16382210"," The more consolidating it is."
"16383450","16388950"," The more the more the more it holds, not just explosive, but the more it holds. "
"16390730","16393250"," For continuation to the upside."
"16394290","16394349"," Okay."
"16395169","16398550"," So that's like the behaviors that you're looking for right where we are right now. "
"16400570","16403770"," We don't want to see, believe it or not, we've set this in the program."
"16403770","16407550"," Whenever you see like the explosive move, oh shit, it's likely not going to hold."
"16412130","16414349"," So we're looking for the behaviors right now. "
"16414790","16418910"," We're all set to zero line here on some good bellow for an upside target."
"16419830","16422270"," So we can see right now that we're bullish."
"16423570","16425330"," Try to get some bars up here. "
"16427270","16429050"," Try to get some bars up here."
"16431029","16433770"," Series of higher lows, kind of."
"16434890","16439710"," Big dip right there, but I want to see the next pull down to be a little bit. "
"16439869","16441450"," No, actually not that low somewhere in here."
"16444340","16447020"," We've got daily bellow zeroing out right now."
"16449419","16452740"," As long as daily valid is not. "
"16453919","16455500"," Begin to break below zero."
"16456259","16458040"," I also want to pay attention to something else."
"16458880","16462040"," Even though we're getting a series of lower lows, what else are we getting?"
"16463220","16464680"," Daily marching up, right?"
"16465419","16465980"," Whoops, maybe not. "
"16466460","16467160"," Okay, maybe yes."
"16467540","16468300"," Okay, maybe yes."
"16469160","16476040"," So as long as this daily keeps marching up this yellow line right here, what is it telling us?"
"16477040","16480660"," Even if price is going lower, what is daily bellow telling us here?"
"16482200","16484419"," It's telling us they were marching up, right?"
"16485200","16488060"," Daily bellow is not falling price down, is it?"
"16490599","16492540"," It's not falling price down, is it?"
"16492860","16493560"," It's going up. "
"16496180","16497160"," It's going up."
"16501290","16503849"," So daily bellow is holding right now, right?"
"16504070","16505509"," So we're trading one minute, five minutes."
"16505689","16509630"," And meanwhile, we're parking right on daily bellow here, right?"
"16510610","16512290"," This is where we're actually parking right now. "
"16515419","16517200"," Notice how we're parking on this line."
"16517360","16518640"," We're not selling this line."
"16519640","16521520"," You see that we're not selling this line?"
"16521860","16523419"," Maybe you do, maybe you don't. "
"16523880","16527860"," I think I showed you earlier in the program when we are selling this line, what it looks like."
"16528200","16529140"," It's pretty fucking violent."
"16530320","16531500"," It's pretty nasty. "
"16532960","16544740"," I know that this looks violent to you on a one minute chart, but it"
"16544740","16546380"," doesn't look violent to me."
"16548160","16550040"," So now we're on this hourly trigger, right?"
"16550800","16553000"," You're going to expect a move up, right?"
"16553939","16555160"," What kind of move do you want?"
"16556020","16561400"," You want consolidation and start taking out these previous highs back here, right?"
"16564880","16565680"," Back over there."
"16569740","16572240"," So I've got some spreads for that to happen down the road. "
"16572680","16574900"," I've got some spreads for September to that for that to happen."
"16578460","16582099"," So I've got some spreads down here, even looking at this other chart down here."
"16586300","16589619"," If I had bought my spreads here, they might be flat, I guess. "
"16590939","16591900"," I didn't buy spreads."
"16592180","16595119"," I guess I could have gotten some theta burn for those spreads, but I didn't buy that."
"16595279","16595860"," I didn't buy that. "
"16596340","16597779"," I did buy that one right there."
"16604610","16608270"," So I'm taking my chances on this daily trigger now with some size."
"16613830","16615770"," So what do I want to see happen here, right?"
"16616990","16618189"," I want to see consolidation. "
"16618730","16624810"," I know you want to see a squeeze into the close because you guys are all like zero day traders"
"16624810","16626110"," and I've turned you all into monsters."
"16631939","16634480"," You guys are like, I want to close all this shit today."
"16636020","16640980"," I want to close all this today and I want to close that tomorrow. "
"16641640","16642380"," Yeah, it's possible."
"16648480","16652560"," I want to see people believe they were going up here, right?"
"16676450","16681450"," I'm on 35 cents for 449C."
"16685210","16686070"," Let's see what happens. "
"16686930","16688150"," Put some risk on with you."
"16696630","16697570"," I made some money today."
"16697669","16698630"," I made good money today. "
"16698869","16699990"," So I'm feeling pretty good."
"16700450","16703310"," Only 25 contracts, just 25."
"16703830","16706810"," So we'll see if we can catch a bounce here. "
"16708070","16709990"," I'll add to the position down here somewhere."
"16711169","16712410"," DCA right down in here."
"16717599","16719919"," Put that green box at right there. "
"16721099","16722840"," I'll buy that right there if it goes down."
"16726820","16727660"," Make that bigger."
"16727880","16729080"," Probably should have made them one dates. "
"16729480","16730099"," Hold on a second here."
"16738540","16740040"," I just lost four cents."
"16740759","16741759"," I just sold. "
"16742860","16744340"," I'm going to try to put one dates on them."
"16744400","16744960"," Hold on a second here."
"16751669","16752529"," Holy shit. "
"16752669","16753009"," They're expensive."
"16759580","16760020"," 452s."
"16763590","16764029"," 452s. "
"16776060","16776660"," All right."
"16776820","16779160"," So I've got a trade set up for 452Cs."
"16779860","16781000"," I haven't bought them yet. "
"16781220","16783060"," They're trading 60 cents right now."
"16787070","16790010"," Oh, they're for August 10th."
"16790390","16792610"," So August 10th, 452C. "
"16805530","16806810"," I guess I can see all that."
"16829470","16829790"," All right."
"16830070","16831150"," That's $1,525. "
"16831910","16836110"," I just bought 452C for August 10th."
"16849700","16849880"," Yeah."
"16849960","16850960"," My call spreads are doing good. "
"16851520","16852580"," I'm happy I'm making money."
"16852940","16853260"," So I'm good."
"16858750","16860310"," I made a $20,000 trade earlier. "
"16860610","16861810"," I made a bunch of punch cash on that."
"16862010","16863150"," So I'm very happy here."
"16863810","16864770"," Very happy, man. "
"16867660","16869980"," I switched to 452s."
"16870080","16871700"," I sold out of 450s for today."
"16872400","16874280"," I bought 450s for a moment. "
"16874720","16877380"," And I bought 452s for tomorrow, the 10th."
"16879340","16881560"," 452 for the 10th."
"16905890","16907890"," I was fucking sweating on that trade earlier, man. "
"16908910","16911950"," I was like, I might lose 20K on a day here with these guys."
"16912310","16913730"," I'm like, I'm going to get fucking wrecked here."
"16916870","16919290"," I haven't lost money like that on stream in a while. "
"16919310","16921050"," It's been probably a year or two."
"16928900","16932300"," I think I've lost a 5,000 or 7,000."
"16933360","16935040"," Pause the puts I've lost the money on. "
"16935920","16939500"," Some puts I've lost the money on."
"16947660","16948700"," Oh, fuck no."
"16949040","16950880"," Desk racking money is six figures. "
"16953090","16954170"," Lose six figures."
"16954170","16956250"," Lose anything between one and 300,000."
"16956810","16957950"," I'm breaking a desk guaranteed. "
"16958710","16960170"," I'll record that shit."
"16960830","16962270"," If you want me to, I will."
"16963530","16964630"," I will break shit. "
"16964750","16965170"," I guarantee it."
"16973380","16974080"," Fuck yeah."
"16975340","16977120"," Yeah, I bought some off. "
"16977420","16979060"," Start a position right here."
"16979160","16980000"," 25 contracts."
"16981060","16982540"," I'm looking to add some more down here. "
"16982800","16984200"," So if I can buy some more down here, I will."
"16985640","16986840"," For tomorrow's expiry."
"16986840","16986960"," Sorry. "
"16987180","16992420"," I've got a lot of money on some spreads for September right now."
"16997380","17004040"," Trying to rotate out of my stock holdings between now and all-time highs."
"17005340","17011260"," And then I'm going to look for a major dip to buy in September, October. "
"17011760","17015280"," And I'm going to look for another dip to buy in February."
"17016000","17018240"," The September, October by."
"17018600","17023140"," I'll likely sell at the beginning of the year and then I'll go flat, fully flat. "
"17024540","17029040"," And look for a major dip by sometime in late winter."
"17030900","17033420"," And I'm in the thesis right now."
"17033580","17036260"," I'm firmly believing that we're going to 5,000. "
"17037500","17042220"," Possibly 6,000 and I have a longer term."
"17044060","17049400"," Thesis of 15,000 in the next 5 years."
"17051580","17053580"," That might be high, maybe 10,000. "
"17054500","17055500"," I don't like this."
"17055900","17058260"," I don't like that everybody's moving up."
"17058460","17059520"," Not that I don't like it. "
"17060920","17062360"," I shouldn't say I don't like it."
"17062560","17067320"," I'm just saying that the $50 an hour thing where that's going to be the base pay for people."
"17068020","17073500"," If base pay for people is going to be $50 an hour, the spy is going to 10,000 to"
"17073500","17074240"," 15,000. "
"17074860","17076160"," I'll guarantee that."
"17077260","17079560"," No, that's what's happening in the background."
"17080580","17088320"," Wage growth is the greatest threat in my view to lower prices on the spy. "
"17089880","17096260"," Greatest threat right now to lower prices on the spy is wage growth."
"17096260","17097060"," And it's happening."
"17097500","17098440"," It's happening. "
"17098460","17103060"," It's the single greatest threat to the price of spy."
"17105150","17114440"," Even the economy, if we get wage growth entrenched in our economy where"
"17114440","17120440"," base pay is 50 bucks, spoons is going way higher."
"17121140","17124200"," There's no fucking way that rich people are going to allow you. "
"17124340","17126980"," There's no way that I'm going to allow you to keep that money."
"17127720","17132060"," I'll be honest, I am going to fucking rent Airbnb's at a higher rate too."
"17133020","17134080"," I'm not going to lie to you. "
"17138360","17141260"," That's greater than the economy, greater than anything."
"17141680","17145900"," If you're all getting paid 50 bucks an hour, there ain't no fucking way you're keeping it."
"17146440","17147060"," That's the truth. "
"17147060","17156870"," I want you to know that there are a lot of union contracts out there, not"
"17156870","17160690"," one all over the place."
"17161830","17163090"," Wages are going up."
"17163390","17164630"," I'm warning you right now. "
"17164770","17165090"," It's early."
"17166090","17166730"," We're way early."
"17166950","17169930"," We're like five to five to ten years from now. "
"17171630","17177730"," So five to ten years from now, I'm giving you a warning right now that wages are going to the"
"17177730","17184810"," moon regardless of what Jerome says, regardless of what the news is telling you."
"17185190","17186970"," I'm talking about the opinion news."
"17188670","17194890"," So you've got very smart people out there, very intelligent people where you and I"
"17194890","17204610"," are out here trying to rob a crystal"
"17204610","17205030"," ball. "
"17207510","17218150"," You and I are listening to some guy on CNBC trying to"
"17218150","17218990"," rob a crystal ball."
"17220930","17226670"," You and I are out there trying to rob a crystal ball as to what Jerome's doing."
"17226850","17236180"," But I assure you that there are people that are not in the stock market and they get hired. "
"17236400","17236820"," They go to school."
"17237080","17239200"," They're the smartest people in the world."
"17239200","17247890"," And they are betting against anything that's being set out there. "
"17249050","17252190"," And that's why you're seeing wage inflation."
"17252710","17255130"," That wage inflation scares the shit out of me."
"17256470","17261970"," When you see large groups of workers saying, hey, we want 50 an hour. "
"17262470","17263410"," It's not one group."
"17263970","17265170"," It's all of them."
"17265910","17269130"," And they're getting the $50 an hour in the next five years. "
"17270570","17272210"," That's a huge thing."
"17275520","17276940"," It's a huge thing."
"17277160","17283100"," It's going to have impacts in the next five or ten years that we don't even see right now. "
"17284020","17285940"," Major impacts in our economy."
"17287040","17288560"," Major historical."
"17289660","17297020"," You're talking about like $20 an hour for a labor was in stone for what?"
"17297780","17298480"," 20 years?"
"17301000","17302340"," Let's say the 20 years. "
"17304560","17314000"," And you're talking about now moving up the going rates over the next five, 10, 15 years to"
"17314000","17314740"," $50."
"17317180","17318580"," That's a major move."
"17319120","17321940"," And the market will price that in 100%. "
"17321940","17322480"," They'll have to."
"17322600","17323140"," They have no choice."
"17323840","17328320"," I guess there'll be some sellers out there that'll say no, but it's not the case. "
"17328380","17330240"," There's going to be a mad Russian dash."
"17331000","17332360"," There already is, right?"
"17333400","17336540"," There's a mad Russian dash right now on inflation, right?"
"17336640","17338420"," And housing, cars, all this other shit."
"17340060","17346900"," And if you want to be the last person on that in the stock market, you go ahead and do"
"17346900","17347060"," it. "
"17348100","17356260"," But I'm looking at this as, I'm looking at this as, you know, they're going to go to 50 fucking"
"17356260","17358820"," dollars an hour in the next five to 10 years, 15 years."
"17358820","17360980"," There ain't no fucking waste buys trading."
"17362460","17364620"," 350 something stupid like that. "
"17364860","17365140"," Maybe."
"17365920","17369520"," I guess anything's possible, but I'm not betting on it."
"17371730","17372710"," It's not just UPS. "
"17374050","17374990"," Like the big three."
"17375550","17383350"," All like all of the construction trades, like your road workers, all of your plumbers, all of your"
"17383350","17388350"," electricians, all the unions for those things are renegotiating right now."
"17388350","17392930"," So that bothers me. "
"17393070","17396090"," Like I got real, like my main street hat, I got a problem with it."
"17396770","17404250"," Because it's, it's the one, it's the one thing in the background that's telling me that they're"
"17404250","17406710"," going to reprice the stock market way higher."
"17406850","17407430"," They're going to have to. "
"17407610","17410390"," How do you not reprice the stock market higher if everybody's getting paid?"
"17410890","17416850"," If a lowly laborers making 50 bucks an hour, what do you think that someone, someone with some,"
"17416890","17421530"," some skill behind them is going to get paid for what they're going to ask for, for money."
"17424280","17426980"," They're going to be asking for packages that are half a million fucking dollars."
"17428020","17432140"," You know, we're like a, like a tech worker now maybe makes a hundred to three hundred thousand"
"17432140","17432560"," dollars. "
"17432740","17434380"," They're going to be asking for three to five hundred thousand."
"17434800","17435200"," Right."
"17435320","17438920"," And then your high end tech worker is going to be asking for three hundred to five hundred"
"17438920","17439340"," thousand. "
"17440580","17444480"," Did you guys see the Netflix, Netflix was looking for AI workers."
"17444840","17447500"," They're paying a million dollars, they think of the high end."
"17449490","17453930"," So like when I see that stuff, like it's not right now, but it's like five, ten years down the"
"17453930","17455490"," road, fifteen years down the road. "
"17456910","17458510"," Like a major reprice on the upside."
"17458890","17466390"," So with that said, whatever that bloodbath is that comes in February, that rechecking of the"
"17466390","17471110"," previous low at 3450, I think I'm going to, I'm thinking I'm going to go heavy and hard into the"
"17471110","17473630"," S&P 500 for 10 or 15 years."
"17475250","17478750"," So I'm looking for that in the winter, late winter. "
"17479550","17481490"," I hope I can get that in the late winter."
"17481730","17482930"," So do your thing bears."
"17483850","17485290"," We're going to February, do your thing. "
"17486050","17488950"," Sell this shit to the depths of hell as deep as you can sell it."
"17490870","17492090"," I'm begging for that."
"17496870","17497850"," It's not about deserving. "
"17498250","17507590"," I think that, so I think that it's about, I think that it's a function of smarter people seeing the"
"17507590","17508830"," truth down the road."
"17509630","17511250"," What's really going to happen?"
"17513450","17517610"," So you have to look towards those people for your guide posts and not CNBC."
"17518490","17522190"," Not some fucking kid, no offense to some reporter out of Barron's. "
"17522550","17525970"," But I'm not going to rely upon that reporter out of Barron's to tell the truth."
"17526230","17527490"," I've dealt with reporters, man."
"17527690","17530210"," They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. "
"17530470","17530970"," They make shit up."
"17531190","17533450"," They fucking spin shit the way they want to spin it."
"17535790","17540670"," So, you know, when I start seeing that stuff, it's really scary. "
"17542650","17545890"," It's scary to the inflation picture in the next 20 years."
"17551900","17553060"," Now you're not understanding."
"17553540","17554540"," You're not understanding. "
"17554780","17555300"," You're not listening."
"17555660","17557260"," Again, dude, you guys got to listen."
"17557580","17565460"," So up into, up into COVID, your tech workers, your best tech workers, we're making somewhere"
"17565460","17567380"," between three and 500,000. "
"17568140","17568660"," You understand?"
"17569380","17569900"," Good."
"17570000","17570820"," I understand this."
"17570960","17575200"," So you're looking at cycles here, like, you're looking at cycles. "
"17575580","17582700"," If your top engineers and stuff are making 300 plus a thousand a year, and now your top engineers"
"17582700","17584640"," are being told, hey, it's a million."
"17585780","17588140"," It's looking forward down the road."
"17588420","17588900"," You know what I'm saying?"
"17589140","17592900"," So you have like a cycle, like 10 years, 20 years. "
"17593700","17598220"," Now you're moving into a new cycle where you're offering that million dollars, right?"
"17600340","17606940"," So, like, we're like microcosming this and not looking at a higher time frame."
"17612910","17613670"," I don't know."
"17614950","17619830"," So robotics to me, I don't, I think, are way farther away than we think that they are. "
"17620630","17624910"," I think AI is closer, but I think robotics is really, really far away."
"17624910","17632130"," I think robotics is much, much farther away."
"17632290","17637150"," And I think my views on AI is that something bad is going to happen. "
"17638370","17640690"," So I think robotics is much farther away."
"17640810","17645470"," Not all of robotics, like stuff with like war and stuff is going to get really nasty."
"17647230","17653710"," But even robotics, I think that your robotics reminds me of us gassing people. "
"17655130","17659290"," Us having a nuclear atomic bomb, two atomic bombs go off."
"17660030","17663990"," I think there's a threshold that we're going to reach on that stuff."
"17665530","17667610"," And there'll be a major pullback. "
"17667990","17670450"," Not that it won't come into its own right at some point."
"17671110","17674210"," But I think at some point you're going to see something major happen."
"17674950","17678530"," And you're going to see an overreaction by politicians. "
"17679310","17684130"," I see that happening next decade or so at some point."
"17684730","17686550"," You're going to see something major happen."
"17687490","17691290"," Something like, you know, we have those, we don't like talking about that stuff, but like the"
"17691290","17695710"," terrorist tax on something that you don't expect to happen. "
"17696490","17699550"," That's probably the greatest existential threat that we have."
"17701630","17706570"," The greatest existential threat that we have right now is something like, it could be anything like"
"17706570","17708770"," crash the stock market."
"17710230","17712970"," Wipeout bank accounts around the world, something like that. "
"17714130","17717870"," Wipeout infrastructure, electrical infrastructure, anything like that done with AI."
"17719730","17728310"," In robotics too, there's a threshold for in war where things could get crazy with robotics quickly."
"17729030","17730310"," More quickly than civilian use. "
"17730790","17734150"," Like there's some civilian use stuff that's going to probably decades away on."
"17734550","17738410"," The application of drone warfare and stuff like that, laser."
"17738610","17740730"," We have big lasers going on right now. "
"17742290","17748590"," Not just laser research, but actual applications that were, we were unable, it's like all those"
"17748590","17750990"," Star Wars programs are coming around right now."
"17751390","17754810"," At least to make fun of back in the 80s, they're like coming into fruition right now."
"17758800","17761060"," So, I think we reach a threshold though. "
"17761060","17761920"," I think we do."
"17762040","17767700"," I think that there's going to be some kind of a conflict where we have mass loss of life and"
"17767700","17772940"," people are going to start threatening to use nukes and shit if it continues, right?"
"17773180","17775940"," Like, continue with those drone strikes, the wrong person, we're going to nuke you."
"17776420","17777760"," You know, something stupid like that. "
"17778260","17782460"," You can even see with terrorists doing it, some kind of an event will take place."
"17782700","17791820"," And you're going to see all the exuberance immediately overnight leave an AI in Robox in my view."
"17795400","17796740"," They got nothing against the road worker. "
"17797560","17798760"," They got nothing against the road worker."
"17798860","17804460"," I just, I'm seeing the writing on the wall is more like it's not like I would prefer us to"
"17804460","17805640"," be at $20 an hour."
"17806540","17808240"," So the cost of goods go lower. "
"17808640","17814180"," The thing about this is whether you make $20 or 50, it's not going to matter, right?"
"17815080","17816220"," You guys understand that, right?"
"17816760","17818420"," It doesn't matter if it's 50 or 20."
"17818420","17821740"," If it's 20, you're going to pay X amount of dollars for eggs."
"17821960","17824580"," If it's 50, you're going to pay higher for eggs, right?"
"17825980","17829660"," People with money and power are going to make sure they take that money out of your hands, right?"
"17830560","17832260"," There'll be a mad gold rush for it. "
"17833240","17837260"," So if we're already getting that, we're getting those signals that wages are going up."
"17838300","17843540"," Right now my thesis is way more upside than the S&B 500."
"17844720","17850360"," Big bumps along the way, you'll see big, major pullbacks and you'll see like, you know, bear runs"
"17850360","17852300"," and bear markets along the way. "
"17852380","17853820"," It's fucking a decade and a half."
"17853840","17855140"," It's not going to go easier fun."
"17856300","17860720"," But you're talking about the start of a secular bear or bull run that lasts for a significant"
"17860720","17861460"," amount of time. "
"17864480","17867120"," I'm with that guy that wrote that story on MarketWatch."
"17867540","17871260"," I've already been reading a bunch of other stuff about it and that stuff's tying right in."
"17872120","17875340"," Like a secular bull run for a decade and a half. "
"17875740","17884340"," And then I think you see the sideways market for a significant amount of time after that."
"17885740","17890780"," I think you see a stagnant market for another 20 years, possibly or 10 years."
"17891580","17894260"," That would be that $20 an hour that you see, right?"
"17895420","17898520"," How long did it take for workers to get paid 20 an hour?"
"17898520","17899300"," Like a labor?"
"17900140","17902500"," How long did they get paid $20 an hour?"
"17902800","17904140"," About a decade, decade and a half. "
"17904420","17910560"," So after that 10, 15 years, you know, a decade, decade and a half of stagnation, wage stagnation,"
"17910560","17911440"," that kind of stuff."
"17917190","17918990"," Yeah, I'm not pro or anti-union."
"17919050","17921430"," I don't care much about unions eat one way or another. "
"17921910","17924130"," I'm just really concerned with the wage inflation."
"17924650","17929910"," Like wage inflation is like, if Jerome was going to say anything, it would be wage inflation."
"17930250","17931990"," That is the scariest thing right now. "
"17933270","17934150"," Absolute scariest."
"17937860","17939980"," I'm going to try to add to a position down here."
"17959080","17964880"," Like wage inflation is like one of the, like it's, it's the writing on the wall kind of stuff,"
"17965120","17965240"," right?"
"17966560","17971600"," And it's like, it's like, like when I heard wage inflation during COVID, I was like, yeah, that'll"
"17971600","17971980"," come back. "
"17973500","17974400"," No big deal."
"17977870","17982910"," And then I saw like, so my wife is always looking for work, right?"
"17983610","17984790"," Always applying shit."
"17985170","17986870"," Large, large, higher offers. "
"17989490","17990990"," Some of that went away."
"17992390","17998470"," But then seeing like the low level workers, wages coming up, they're like, not low level, but just"
"17998470","17998930"," low pay."
"17999790","18004270"," Like $20, $30 an hour workers starting to ask for $40, $50 an hour and getting it. "
"18005570","18006350"," That's concerning."
"18006870","18010750"," Like there's people in the background that are doing the math on that and they are expecting like,"
"18011110","18012530"," UPS is not going to pay."
"18013490","18016970"," Auto workers, if they're going to get 50 an hour, right?"
"18017530","18018930"," Who do you think pays for that?"
"18020290","18023910"," Do you think, you think the big three are going to say, fuck it, we're going to take less profit?"
"18024210","18024670"," Fuck no. "
"18025570","18026670"," I'm going to say that."
"18026970","18029190"," I'm going to pass those costs along to you."
"18030590","18034590"," If you're making $50 an hour, they're going to charge you more for your car. "
"18034930","18035590"," Same thing for UPS."
"18036790","18040670"," UPS pays $175,000 a year in between paying benefits."
"18040670","18043010"," That's where they're passing that. "
"18043190","18044330"," You think they're just going to eat that?"
"18044610","18045390"," They're going to be like, oh, fuck it."
"18045950","18049610"," We're going to look out for the UPS worker at home shipping his packages."
"18049890","18050910"," No, they're going to charge more. "
"18073030","18073930"," It's really weird."
"18074010","18075150"," It's a really sketchy thing."
"18075510","18080590"," It's a really dangerous, dangerous future inflation ahead of us. "
"18081230","18082190"," Like real dangerous."
"18082530","18085050"," Like if you just look at the inflation chart too, right?"
"18085890","18088430"," It's like it came up here."
"18090490","18092650"," Let's say this is the bottom of the inflation chart. "
"18093250","18094010"," We're like right here."
"18096840","18101100"," I'm like, oh, I'm looking for is like the, yeah, we did it."
"18101360","18102060"," Drop the market. "
"18103160","18109020"," And then, you know, and then down here and then right off the chart."
"18110060","18112340"," And you're going to see inflation do that steady climb."
"18113260","18118760"," You know, like that there's marching forward over the next decade and a half. "
"18119320","18120080"," It's going to suck."
"18125120","18129060"," Yeah, I watch option pricing on, um, on thinkorswim."
"18130020","18132720"," You can get the exact option that you want with the expiry. "
"18133540","18136640"," It shows you a graph of it going up and down over time as it expires."
"18137440","18138000"," It's a great little tool."
"18138180","18138880"," I used these all the time. "
"18140180","18140740"," You know what?"
"18140760","18142120"," If you want, maybe I'll try to get that."
"18142340","18146220"," Let me ask, uh, let me ask the dev if I can get that inside the website."
"18155080","18158200"," I'll ask the dev, I'll ask the devs if we can get that on the website. "
"18158580","18159520"," That'd be a cool chart to have."
"18160340","18161500"," I used to use it all the time."
"18161600","18162240"," It's a great little chart. "
"18162780","18163400"," It does a good job."
"18164460","18167840"," It shows you like the life of an option on a graph going down, like this."
"18168800","18169480"," Usually down. "
"18170380","18172020"," It goes just like this the whole way down."
"18172780","18173960"," You're like, look where you're supposed to buy."
"18174140","18174940"," Look where you're supposed to sell. "
"18175660","18176520"," Look where you're supposed to buy."
"18176680","18177920"," Look where you're supposed to sell as they expire."
"18195080","18195360"," I am. "
"18195920","18197500"," Uh, so Matt Phillip, I'm looking."
"18198340","18203060"," I'm hoping to put about a half million dollars into the market in late February."
"18203620","18206580"," Uh, to own it for about a decade and a half. "
"18210280","18214080"," I put a half million dollars in for a decade and a half and see what it does."
"18214640","18217280"," Uh, but I'm not, I want to, I was considered Tesla."
"18218220","18219780"," Maybe a small portion in Tesla. "
"18221260","18223740"," Uh, for some risk, but I like the spot."
"18224840","18227740"," Uh, I also like the idea of buying Vanguard too."
"18228100","18231400"," So Vanguard is on the, on the, on the, on the table too for that. "
"18235040","18236260"," I haven't DC had yet."
"18236260","18240020"," I want to see this test of this, uh, red line right here."
"18241380","18242400"," I'm looking to add here. "
"18245460","18246600"," My trade is not for today."
"18246620","18247080"," It's for tomorrow."
"18247120","18247660"," So I'm good. "
"18254560","18257240"," Oh, deckhand doggy saying that we both shows options charts."
"18257240","18257900"," I didn't know that."
"18258420","18258920"," That's cool. "
"18259680","18260480"," You have to show us."
"18260540","18261180"," Show me that one day."
"18261180","18261640"," I didn't know that. "
"18265750","18268410"," I think that, uh, spy will go up after the CPI."
"18268430","18270230"," I think the CPI report comes in hot."
"18271950","18275710"," Um, I don't know how much it matters to the up and down of spy right now. "
"18277870","18279190"," I'm not really, I'm not."
"18279350","18280050"," I don't really trust."
"18280330","18281430"," I don't really trust the news. "
"18281450","18284570"," Like I'll tell you what the price is or the price."
"18284570","18288130"," I'll tell you what the, um, I'm going to say let me go over there and see this."
"18288470","18291350"," I think the price of spy will tell you if it's a good or bad report. "
"18292670","18293890"," It's like the whole bad news."
"18294010","18295770"," Good news thing right down here."
"18295790","18297070"," I'm looking right down here to DCA. "
"18297070","18298070"," So I'm looking over here."
"18298510","18300970"," A little bit more blood coming."
"18308750","18310090"," Sellers coming in down here. "
"18310090","18321470"," So I"
"18321470","18324030"," think, uh, spy or NAS that go up after the CPI."
"18324370","18324890"," I think the C."
"18325030","18326630"," I think CPI is bad."
"18327490","18330970"," Um, I think we normally we have, so just so you know. "
"18333790","18339570"," Um, if this is, uh, this was high inflation and wait a minute."
"18340270","18345890"," This is high inflation and this is, uh, bad or low inflation, low high inflation."
"18347370","18350730"," When we're making our way down, we usually have hiccups along the way. "
"18351650","18352870"," We're kind of due for one."
"18354050","18355430"," And then that's the last leg."
"18355610","18356290"," We're somewhere in here. "
"18357170","18358590"," It's about where we are right now."
"18358870","18359570"," We're due for one."
"18361290","18362230"," But spy has been coming down. "
"18362510","18366090"," So I'm not, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not."
"18367310","18369850"," If bad news is good news, wouldn't shock me."
"18372590","18373350"," You'll get bears. "
"18373550","18377210"," Come on and say it's already been priced in something like that."
"18377210","18377650"," I don't know."
"18381480","18382640"," Uh, what else we got here?"
"18387200","18388000"," Desktop right. "
"18388340","18391240"," Uh, click on the option and you can put them in a watch list too."
"18391280","18391620"," It's sweet."
"18392000","18392440"," That's cool. "
"18394500","18395960"," Matt's flat seat tomorrow as well."
"18395960","18397880"," Matt could have perspectives as possible."
"18397920","18400260"," Data points that I've used challenge to make a good trades. "
"18400260","18401820"," I'm always on the other side of the trade."
"18402420","18403920"," Makes me think I wish I appreciate."
"18404480","18404800"," Yeah. "
"18405280","18408220"," You know, like chase, uh, I like chase, but chase been wrong all year."
"18408340","18420720"," So yeah, I'm"
"18420720","18421340"," not on that."
"18421540","18424680"," Um, we're still trading 447, man. "
"18424680","18426240"," Like we're still trading the daily trigger."
"18426240","18428640"," Like there's been nothing here so far."
"18432350","18436500"," Like we haven't even broken up or trend yet. "
"18436780","18438200"," We haven't even broken like 425 yet."
"18438940","18444340"," Like you guys are all like, say a three month process for trend break too, right?"
"18444700","18445580"," One to three months usually."
"18446260","18449960"," You guys are all like fucking calling tops like every fucking week. "
"18451000","18452040"," Never ending."
"18452680","18453780"," Like never fucking ends."
"18459140","18460660"," Dude, like killing me. "
"18462840","18463960"," Straight killing me."
"18468280","18469220"," It's like a process."
"18469380","18472660"," Even if the market rolls over, it's like, it's like one month to three months. "
"18474580","18476300"," It's like all this, all this like."
"18477100","18477840"," Call the top."
"18477980","18479900"," Yeah, but you did another 24 fucking times. "
"18480620","18483940"," You know, it's actually a place to sell this market."
"18484140","18484500"," It's not here."
"18484620","18484960"," It's not today. "
"18488300","18490820"," We can bloodbath the 425 and tomorrow's open."
"18491040","18492580"," It's not the place to sell the market."
"18505560","18506620"," It's like so much drama. "
"18506920","18507440"," I call it drama."
"18507640","18509120"," I'm like drama, drama, drama, drama."
"18525510","18527130"," I'm missing a bunch of what you guys are saying here. "
"18527310","18530070"," My chat is blowing by really fast."
"18539500","18546970"," Yeah, I got nothing for him."
"18547010","18547950"," I'm a buyer of this market. "
"18548130","18551390"," I used to be a bear and I've got, dude, I've lost more money as a bear than I've ever"
"18551390","18552130"," lost as a buyer."
"18554110","18555230"," Like stupid money."
"18555670","18560310"," I've lost close to a million dollars at this point probably. "
"18561350","18562770"," Being a seller of this market."
"18563030","18563710"," So never again."
"18564550","18567350"," Never, ever, never, ever make that mistake again. "
"18568090","18569710"," Ever make that mistake again."
"18570330","18571790"," It's like a golden rule."
"18572650","18573870"," The buyer of this market. "
"18576070","18581310"," On any, any capitulation, any, any like down craziness by this market."
"18582230","18585590"," A long time participant in this market I'm going to continue to be."
"18586450","18590970"," So any kind of blob the worst news you give me, the worst it sounds, the most horrible it becomes,"
"18591090","18592950"," the more eager I've become the buyer. "
"18600470","18602390"," Yeah, I can't listen to it anymore."
"18602730","18604090"," I drank that Kool-Aid, man."
"18604210","18604850"," I was that guy. "
"18605410","18611350"," I was like, after I think, like, I think it was my second to 50 year trading."
"18612550","18614030"," So like, you're two to year."
"18614490","18615390"," You're two to year. "
"18615990","18619690"," I think of the first couple of years I was like, I'm a bull, I'm a bull."
"18619690","18622010"," I was making all kinds of money and I would lose some money."
"18622850","18625210"," And then I became, I learned too much. "
"18626490","18627590"," I read everything."
"18629510","18635530"," And I was like, I'm an expert on all of a sudden, I'm an expert on why the market should"
"18635530","18636050"," go down."
"18636470","18637470"," I think that was the big thing. "
"18638110","18639970"," So I'm not going to tell you that I wasn't that guy."
"18640110","18640970"," So I wasn't that guy."
"18641670","18643890"," Like, I knew, I knew every reason the market should go down. "
"18644010","18645650"," Every single reason why it should go to zero."
"18645650","18647870"," And it happens."
"18648850","18650890"," But it's just another opportunity by the fucking dip. "
"18651110","18653390"," So if that happens, you buy that fucking dip."
"18654150","18655770"," This market goes up."
"18656430","18657670"," Those things are going to happen. "
"18658530","18662650"," You're always going to have those, like, events that take place outside of the market that send it"
"18662650","18663230"," down to zero."
"18663310","18664830"," Not zero, but, you know, bloodbath it."
"18665150","18666190"," COVID being one of them. "
"18666450","18667530"," 9-11, another one."
"18668030","18669650"," 87, you know, like crazy just happened 87."
"18670790","18671990"," It's like, are those things going to happen?"
"18672190","18673950"," Yeah, but are you trading them?"
"18673950","18675110"," Like, fuck no. "
"18676550","18677930"," Are you hedging for them?"
"18678170","18678330"," Yes."
"18679650","18680710"," Sure, I'll hedge it."
"18688850","18690390"," Yeah, Barry was wrong, man. "
"18690810","18694710"," So Barry missed out on a ton of money."
"18694910","18696010"," I love Barry, by the way."
"18696030","18697150"," I don't want you to think I don't like him. "
"18697830","18698950"," I like him a lot."
"18700530","18701810"," He's got a great story."
"18702250","18707950"," But the truth is that Barry lost a lot of money while that market went up. "
"18707950","18711990"," And I mean, hand over fist money."
"18712550","18714670"," Hand over fist money."
"18715850","18721810"," And when that market rolled the first time, people had the chance to get out. "
"18722750","18724050"," So that's a big problem."
"18724990","18726490"," Big, giant problem."
"18726810","18733010"," Like, right there from Get One, as that market went higher and higher and higher and higher, there"
"18733010","18736290"," was so much money to be made to have a great life. "
"18736290","18740850"," And then even after the first roll, it came back up again."
"18741530","18744610"," Now, the second roll is where he actually made money."
"18745510","18746910"," People don't realize that. "
"18747370","18751370"," If we didn't get that second roll, Barry would be in prison today, like prison."
"18752410","18756770"," And even though he came out on top, he didn't come out on top by that much."
"18757230","18761870"," He waited forever for that money for him to make that money. "
"18762270","18764310"," You know, you're talking about time."
"18766030","18767370"," You know, it's like, can you be right?"
"18767730","18768610"," Yeah, how long did it take?"
"18768950","18769450"," A decade?"
"18770150","18773050"," Well, I think it was six years or so."
"18773170","18774130"," It could be six to seven years. "
"18774130","18774730"," It could be wrong in that."
"18774870","18776890"," But you can fix my math on that."
"18777030","18778390"," But I think it was like six or seven years. "
"18783340","18786780"," Yeah, no, and this is the worst part of it all."
"18786980","18787680"," Here's the worst part."
"18788520","18794360"," For him to stay in that trade, he needs to take more money, like more money, more money, more"
"18794360","18796440"," money, DCA, DCA, DCA. "
"18797300","18802280"," So he looks like a Robin Hood for the regular person out there."
"18804790","18810530"," But he's, yeah, that's like every time I see a short seller say something like, I'm doing it"
"18810530","18811310"," because of values."
"18811750","18813190"," I'm like, they don't like you either. "
"18813370","18819570"," Like the person on the street doesn't fucking like you if you're a short seller or a buyer of this"
"18819570","18819890"," market."
"18820110","18820410"," I'm sorry."
"18820590","18821270"," You think that they do. "
"18821390","18821970"," They don't like you."
"18823490","18828150"," You know, like, Barry's gotten that kind of a good rep from people on the man on the street."
"18829650","18836550"," But in reality, Barry would sell something to zero that has no need to be going to zero either. "
"18837090","18841150"," You know, Barry will short a stock in a zero even if it even if it doesn't deserve to be"
"18841150","18841470"," at zero."
"18841670","18845630"," So, you know, like, I don't buy all that bullshit either that."
"18846730","18848390"," That's like, what do you call it, white knighting?"
"18848730","18849710"," That's what guys do, right?"
"18849870","18850390"," They white knight. "
"18850390","18852810"," That's like white knighting in the stock market."
"18855850","18856370"," Yeah."
"18862090","18866230"," I'm telling you, like if you look back on the actual trade, right?"
"18866510","18868470"," It was not a good trade. "
"18869390","18870650"," It was not a good trade."
"18871270","18875170"," It was not a good fucking trade."
"18875810","18876330"," No. "
"18878290","18883230"," The net results, what looks great on paper, but not a good trade."
"18893830","18894830"," It was not a good trade."
"18894970","18895870"," It was a horrible trade. "
"18897090","18899110"," It's kind of like, I don't know how to explain it."
"18899270","18900290"," You know what it reminds me of?"
"18900370","18906530"," It reminds me of the, remember the famous picture where they had all the people on Wall Street"
"18906530","18909910"," drinking champagne while the market was burning?"
"18910130","18910510"," Do you know why?"
"18911350","18913410"," Because they made so much fucking money in that run up."
"18913910","18915570"," That's the truth behind the scenes. "
"18921650","18923730"," You got like Mike Barry shaking his fist."
"18923730","18924290"," I won."
"18924750","18930270"," But in reality, he probably could have made, what do you make $100 million or something?"
"18931130","18932110"," I don't remember anymore. "
"18932370","18933990"," It's been a long time since I've read that shit."
"18934690","18936090"," What do you make $100 million or something like that?"
"18936290","18938750"," He could have made fucking $1 billion in that time period."
"18939710","18942050"," So his $100 million, he can take his $100 million and walk away. "
"18948420","18950300"," No, I don't know if there's a short squeeze there, Chase."
"18950300","18952520"," You got triggers on your side right now."
"18952820","18954840"," You got a bear cross coming up here. "
"18956180","18958280"," I'm not adding to my position here because of this."
"18959740","18962480"," I don't want to see price reject here and start bleeding down."
"18962660","18964140"," And then we take this up here. "
"18966310","18967510"," I'm not adding here at all."
"18968770","18973890"," I wanted to add right here, but that blood right there, no fucking way I was adding there."
"18982090","18982770"," I'll add above. "
"18983750","18984810"," I'll add here."
"18987820","18989360"," And I'll add down here."
"18991270","18992790"," I ain't fucking adding down. "
"18992950","18995290"," I didn't add until that happens or this happens."
"18995990","18998930"," So either way, that's where I add or I add here there."
"18999810","19000910"," No trade for me right now. "
"19009770","19010770"," Maybe it was $4 billion."
"19010930","19011190"," I don't know."
"19011410","19012090"," I don't know what it was. "
"19012450","19013710"," So he would have made $10 billion."
"19016010","19017790"," Whatever it was, it wasn't enough."
"19018450","19019190"," It wasn't enough. "
"19019430","19020530"," It wasn't anywhere near enough."
"19024800","19027300"," Yeah, I don't care what the number was."
"19027860","19030880"," He missed out on so much money. "
"19031020","19031820"," It wasn't even funny."
"19033700","19034820"," So much money."
"19034920","19035580"," It wasn't even funny. "
"19039650","19041250"," It's not even an argument."
"19041570","19046730"," It's like the whole world's rock starring party."
"19047010","19050490"," And you're over there to shorten this shit down. "
"19050750","19051550"," Shorten this shit down."
"19058540","19059280"," Fucking true."
"19061300","19065260"," The only thing you needed to see was the champagne drinking on Wall Street. "
"19065580","19066720"," It's the only thing you needed to see."
"19067400","19068600"," They don't want you to know that."
"19068600","19070080"," That's the worst part of this. "
"19070280","19072360"," The greatest trick that's pulled."
"19073880","19077600"," The greatest trick that's ever pulled on people is..."
"19079400","19081280"," They make you believe this shit."
"19082940","19084140"," It's like politicians. "
"19085140","19088000"," You got a politician out there that's like..."
"19088600","19089520"," I don't know."
"19089620","19090940"," I believe in family values."
"19092520","19095080"," I don't believe in abortion. "
"19097300","19098040"," I don't know."
"19098140","19100500"," You have a Democrat that's like..."
"19100500","19103100"," I want gun control, but they own guns, right?"
"19103840","19105820"," If you pick the issue, I don't care what it is."
"19105960","19110420"," I don't care if it's a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, right?"
"19110560","19112640"," But the greatest trick that they pull is..."
"19113300","19115540"," You believe something that's not true. "
"19116720","19118460"," It's like you believe that..."
"19120700","19125700"," You believe that a Republican or a Democrat believes what you believe, right?"
"19125700","19126580"," You believe that."
"19126740","19130820"," You're like, I'm voting with that person because they have my interests at heart."
"19133270","19135910"," The truth is, those people don't have your interests at heart. "
"19136070","19137270"," They don't care about your interests."
"19137630","19140370"," And those people likely don't do any of the things that you do."
"19140930","19142670"," They don't live like you live. "
"19144030","19147290"," They don't sit in front of a TV like you might sit in front of a TV."
"19148670","19150570"," They're not recycling."
"19151070","19153230"," They hire somebody to do their recycling for them. "
"19153230","19155910"," You know, there's like a..."
"19155910","19157050"," I'm the little person."
"19158250","19160090"," And that person is like me."
"19160930","19163170"," And that person is nothing like you. "
"19164370","19166030"," Some of that with Barry too, right?"
"19166330","19169330"," There's like, yeah, we'll throw them Barry so that they feel like they won."
"19170430","19171870"," Barry was on their side."
"19175390","19180850"," So, you know, you feel good because Barry was your Robin Hood. "
"19180850","19187110"," But in fact, they robbed the system while that was going on."
"19188870","19189610"," You know what I mean?"
"19189750","19190870"," They robbed it for all of it."
"19190950","19191950"," They took it all and they ran. "
"19192130","19196370"," They fucking lined their pockets and they fucking got fat and rich."
"19197950","19199070"," That's what you need to know."
"19202020","19203080"," Sweet, squeeze an R."
"19212360","19215240"," You know, so that's what the thing here is like. "
"19217280","19218680"," Can you decipher?"
"19219260","19221720"," Can you interpret what's real and what's not real?"
"19225140","19226900"," It's an important part of life, right?"
"19229650","19231290"," Like what are the motivations of people?"
"19231970","19233990"," Why are they telling you the things that are telling you?"
"19234230","19235330"," What do they want from you?"
"19237050","19238950"," Well, how do they want you to feel, think?"
"19239750","19243470"," How are you going to always be a pleb or a serf?"
"19245650","19248830"," And I see like Republicans, Democrats fighting with each other bothers me."
"19249490","19252190"," I see like, I see that stuff playing out like I saw that."
"19252410","19253510"," I saw that fight the other day. "
"19255010","19259330"," Like I don't know the whole story on it, but I saw that fight on the waterfront the other day."
"19259390","19262030"," And I'm like, these people are fucking wanting to murder each other."
"19264290","19266210"," For all kinds of fucked up reasons. "
"19267430","19272870"," You know, like you're being turned on each other and it's perfect."
"19273470","19277290"," Everything someone in power wants, right?"
"19277470","19278850"," It's everything that someone in power wants."
"19278970","19281510"," They want you fighting your common man. "
"19281670","19283610"," Those people don't fight behind closed doors."
"19284030","19287610"," They do it on the floor and stuff, but they don't do it privately."
"19288610","19289710"," They're all partying, man. "
"19289850","19290470"," That's what they're doing."
"19290910","19291690"," Having a good time."
"19292670","19294230"," Rich people have a good time. "
"19294950","19295850"," I know rich people."
"19295950","19296550"," I hang out with them."
"19297950","19299630"," They have a great fucking time. "
"19299830","19300750"," They love to have a good time."
"19300750","19302630"," They don't give a fuck about politics."
"19302990","19303650"," Sometimes they do. "
"19303970","19304630"," It's rare."
"19306350","19307670"," It's rare that you see it."
"19307830","19309190"," Or maybe they have enough money they don't care. "
"19310590","19312570"," It's all about power and money."
"19313410","19313990"," That's the truth."
"19318720","19320420"," It's I'm telling you, it's power and money. "
"19321520","19324320"," The more that you fight about it, the better off they are."
"19326860","19332580"," The more that you're fighting over it, the more that you're fighting over things that don't matter."
"19332580","19335040"," And making those things matter. "
"19335700","19337520"," I told the story on stream once."
"19338360","19343520"," You get on a jury duty, right?"
"19343900","19345320"," I'm sitting there in jury duty."
"19346920","19350260"," And you see certain people, people of color. "
"19351160","19353460"," Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right?"
"19353740","19355180"," I'm like, oh man, why is it all people of color?"
"19355560","19357040"," I'm like, still like, okay, whatever."
"19358220","19361900"," And then all of a sudden you see the guy that's hard core Republican."
"19362580","19366400"," They're just running in with DWIs like DWI DWI. "
"19367420","19369420"," Turnies show compassion, show compassion."
"19369820","19371380"," I'm like, these guys are all voting for these laws."
"19372260","19374380"," Mandatory sentencing and all this kind of shit. "
"19374500","19375860"," I'm like, why are they voting for this?"
"19376580","19379520"," And yet they're getting, what's the most pulled over DWI in the country?"
"19380340","19380860"," What is it?"
"19380960","19381280"," Anybody know?"
"19381960","19382800"," It's a fucking Dodge Ram."
"19383740","19384740"," Dodge fucking Ram."
"19386280","19389860"," So you got these same people voting for being hard on criminals. "
"19389860","19393780"," And guess who's getting dragged in front of the judge for these DWIs?"
"19394100","19395360"," These same fucking people."
"19401470","19404570"," These same fucking people are voting for these people."
"19404810","19406550"," And then they're like, be hard on crime. "
"19406870","19407210"," Don't reform."
"19408050","19410630"," And yet they're the ones being pulled, put it in front of the judge."
"19412330","19413610"," You can say I don't know why. "
"19415230","19417730"," You would think we'd have DWI reform in this country."
"19418190","19423250"," Some kind of like, I don't know, make them pick up trash instead of getting money for the county."
"19424490","19425570"," Think something, you know. "
"19427410","19429570"," To actually get people to stop drinking and driving."
"19430810","19439270"," Yeah, they throw the money around."
"19439830","19442710"," Dan Brizlin just said, my uncle is a high-power attorney in DC. "
"19443390","19446150"," When I asked he was voting for Clinton or Trump, he said Clinton easy, why?"
"19446350","19447170"," They throw the money around."
"19451250","19452810"," My dad was a lobbyist."
"19453310","19456750"," The things that I saw when I was a kid, I was like, I'll never trust these fucking people. "
"19457510","19457870"," Ever."
"19459670","19461630"," There's a few of them, they're like, straight shooters."
"19461970","19464010"," My back, my father-in-law is a politician. "
"19466050","19467650"," And he's, you know, kind of up there."
"19468650","19469890"," And he's a straight shooter."
"19470370","19471350"," He's like a, he's a true believer. "
"19472150","19473130"," He's a straight shooter."
"19473950","19474510"," He really is."
"19474690","19476330"," Like, truthfully is a straight shooter politician. "
"19476550","19478970"," But he's not high enough in politics, so that doesn't matter."
"19479210","19480270"," He's high, but not high enough."
"19482400","19490230"," Yeah, he doesn't care about anything but money and power, right?"
"19490430","19491050"," I mean, ask your uncle. "
"19491310","19491730"," Is this your uncle?"
"19492030","19492510"," Yeah, ask your uncle."
"19492690","19493270"," What does he care about?"
"19494430","19497330"," Now, the stock market, what is, do you guys know the stock market cares about?"
"19497510","19499730"," Care about, they care about gridlock."
"19500170","19502110"," Stock market wants gridlock in the politics. "
"19503070","19505230"," And they want money and, they want money and power, right?"
"19505410","19507070"," They want people to do what they want them to do."
"19507550","19509750"," That's like what the stock market wants, what rich power people want."
"19511590","19513010"," We want more money and more power. "
"19515840","19519080"," And money doesn't give you power."
"19519220","19520020"," That's another thing too."
"19521040","19523580"," There's two separate things that intersect. "
"19527910","19529770"," Money and power, two separate things."
"19530390","19533570"," And if you ask me, I would say power is worth more than money."
"19537880","19541300"," If you wanted my take on that, I think power is worth way more than money. "
"19546120","19548080"," Yeah, you joined the team or you won't be there long agreed."
"19552140","19553940"," Power is better than money."
"19559190","19561130"," Oh, dude, truly mark rolling over?"
"19561350","19561970"," We're not even there. "
"19561970","19564950"," We're like so far from the market rolling over."
"19565050","19565650"," It's not even funny."
"19567810","19569150"," Like what kind of rolling over do you mean?"
"19569290","19569970"," What's your price target?"
"19570170","19570570"," What do you type?"
"19570730","19571950"," What kind of roll over you're talking about?"
"19572230","19576170"," Are you talking about 425, 440, or this is the top?"
"19576970","19577350"," Which one?"
"19578570","19580890"," 444, not 420, but we get three targets. "
"19582210","19583510"," Tell me which one you're talking about."
"19584430","19588710"," 440, 432, market crash."
"19590150","19590610"," There you get three. "
"19590610","19594760"," Who asked that question?"
"19599010","19601850"," A-N-H-K-O zero."
"19608560","19608900"," Which one?"
"19609180","19613700"," Are you talking about 440, 432, or is this the market roll, like a crash?"
"19617440","19618940"," Yeah, it's 432 right now."
"19619220","19629200"," It's 440, 432, and market crash to the monthly. "
"19631060","19633000"," I guess that would be a market crash, right?"
"19633440","19634300"," No, we're not there."
"19635140","19636580"," We're not even close to being there."
"19638160","19641160"," I know 425 is on trend, right?"
"19642420","19643980"," It's actually still on trend. "
"19644360","19645920"," It's the bottom of the trend going up."
"19648860","19652300"," And even there, you'd likely get a failure to make it all time high again."
"19653040","19653380"," Likely. "
"19654140","19656620"," You get one more giant rip higher."
"19658640","19661580"," It's a process, normally, unless there's something we don't know."
"19664570","19667350"," You don't just sell the market that fast and have buyers. "
"19667810","19668850"," It just doesn't happen like that."
"19668850","19669690"," They need bag holders."
"19675440","19676320"," Yeah, yeah. "
"19677360","19681900"," Trade out for 25th time to get out of the recovery, but if we reject that level, look for long"
"19681900","19682260"," term."
"19682660","19686660"," I'm in this market right now for multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars, so."
"19687680","19690020"," You'll know it if I think we ain't coming back to that number. "
"19690780","19697340"," The worst case scenario would be we do get a violent crash down, and the only idea I have on"
"19697340","19700460"," that is that you stay long because in a month and a half will likely be right back to where"
"19700460","19700740"," we were."
"19702800","19706980"," That would actually signal 5,000 really fast, believe it or not."
"19711730","19713190"," Yeah, I'm not a fair flam. "
"19713350","19713970"," I'm dip buying."
"19714210","19718450"," I'm dip buying the daily trigger and I'm trying to dip by the weekly if I can get it."
"19718790","19722490"," I don't like seeing Apple so close to the 174. "
"19722970","19725470"," That gives me pause where we are right now."
"19725790","19732210"," Like seeing Apple trade 174 makes me think they were closer to a bottom than I thought."
"19734110","19736530"," I don't see Apple going lower than 174. "
"19736910","19738690"," Maybe it does, but I'm not seeing it."
"19738870","19741790"," So just trading 177 on a low today."
"19742290","19745590"," So maybe we get another down data 174 in Apple. "
"19746390","19747570"," Maybe a quick breakthrough."
"19748270","19753770"," So I'm watching Apple in the background and I'm like, yeah, 173, four somewhere in their sounds"
"19753770","19754110"," right."
"19755430","19757670"," I think pools are going to want to buy that. "
"19757670","19768080"," So like"
"19768080","19773660"," the, it's like Apple is, I'm watching Apple in the background and I'm like, yeah, Apple just hit"
"19773660","19774420"," 177."
"19776620","19779920"," Maybe one more roll down to get Apple at the weekly."
"19782380","19784360"," Maybe, maybe one more roll down. "
"19785700","19791620"," But it looks to me like rotation in spy while they're cleaning house in Apple and tickers like"
"19791620","19791840"," that."
"19807010","19813170"," I think the, like, I think the major role, well, I think there's a major pullback in September,"
"19813630","19816390"," October, and then a major pullback in January, February."
"19817630","19819570"," I think that's the big one to be looking for. "
"19820330","19821410"," Or the two big ones."
"19822870","19824390"," Like break of weekly, all that kind of stuff."
"19824670","19826330"," Like, not just break either. "
"19826670","19830970"," Like if you dip the wick down and it bounces, that's not the correction I'm looking for."
"19831690","19834910"," I'm looking for like a nasty correction in fall."
"19835310","19836210"," Really pretty bad. "
"19857630","19860550"," I mean, you're like, you get Apple trade and 174."
"19861910","19863270"," Is that what 196?"
"19865290","19868410"," Are you telling me you're going to clip Apple to what 150?"
"19869310","19870870"," 25% of its value."
"19871250","19871950"," I don't know. "
"19873550","19875170"," Maybe it's possible."
"19876330","19879930"," You're going to clip 50% of its value by September and October."
"19880450","19882750"," With that correction, maybe. "
"19884630","19887470"," What are you going to clip 75% of its value by February?"
"19888270","19888770"," Maybe."
"19889130","19889510"," I guess so."
"19889650","19890270"," Maybe it's possible. "
"19891710","19897200"," See Apple in February at like 80 bucks, 70 bucks."
"19898980","19900080"," I guess that's possible."
"19905140","19910380"," It's like 175, then a new low at 150, then a new low at 80 or 90 by February. "
"19911300","19911620"," It's possible."
"19925880","19927120"," There's a ton of calls here."
"19928820","19931260"," There's a ton of zero-day calls right now in the market. "
"19935090","19941560"," For today, I believe they're on 448c."
"19942640","19944340"," It's going to stop us from going up here."
"19946870","19947590"," So here's 448. "
"19949890","19958500"," There's a giant brick of calls right here at 448c's."
"19959060","19960860"," That's stopping us from going up right now."
"19967930","19969490"," They will do anything to pin this. "
"19971860","19974060"," Sometimes they'll close the money, but very rarely."
"19976520","19979520"," One out of 10 times, two out of 10 times."
"19980660","19982600"," Very rare to see it happen. "
"19983280","19985620"," If they pull those calls off, it'll rip, but they have to pull them off."
"20008250","20010150"," Election season, I factor that in."
"20010250","20011510"," I factor in election seasons. "
"20012230","20012750"," Yeah, I do."
"20016410","20017910"," I do factor that in."
"20020290","20023310"," Factor election seasons, factor in unknowns. "
"20023310","20027390"," Not the JPM one, the unknown, unknown volatility."
"20028130","20030890"," Every three to five years, I expect something terrible to happen."
"20031490","20032150"," Really bad. "
"20034010","20035430"," COVID was the last one."
"20035790","20038970"," We're just starting to get into the tail end of that risk."
"20040250","20046250"," So we've got another two years, probably until something terrible happens. "
"20046630","20047210"," Something we don't see."
"20048530","20050230"," Every five years or so."
"20050650","20054730"," Three to five years, you start to see like some kind of an event take place. "
"20059410","20061930"," So I expect something in the next two years, something bad."
"20066900","20068180"," Yeah, I'll stay alive for Disney."
"20068460","20069280"," You want to look at it real quick?"
"20070460","20071300"," Let's look at it. "
"20072360","20074100"," I'm not in Disney right now."
"20074220","20075640"," Never re-entered a trade."
"20075960","20077800"," Took up a bunch of calls at like 88. "
"20078220","20079820"," I think it went to 89 something."
"20080420","20082200"," It's like 8886 or something like that."
"20082320","20083700"," I got out on Disney. "
"20083700","20085520"," I made a good money on that trade."
"20085760","20086600"," It was an excellent trade."
"20089570","20092310"," Let's look at one second here. "
"20096710","20097990"," I am interested in Disney."
"20098670","20100850"," I might consider buying Disney today too."
"20102450","20108530"," If Disney can get down to like the 70s, what time is their actual ER at?"
"20125940","20127560"," What time does Disney report?"
"20140220","20142400"," Nah, it doesn't report until 430. "
"20146640","20148620"," It says results at 430."
"20148620","20150700"," Can anybody see if it's at four?"
"20151060","20159510"," It says their results and their guidance is at 4 p.m. Forecast is 99 cents."
"20159970","20163830"," Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings per share of 95 cents. "
"20164410","20166530"," Revs of 22.5 billion."
"20167710","20171150"," I did see someone on Wall Street."
"20171330","20182290"," Betts made a post saying the short Disney on"
"20182290","20184410"," a bad expected bad ER. "
"20211070","20213330"," They're actually adding to these calls right now."
"20213430","20220070"," If you can see this at home, there's someone probably a dealer at home."
"20220330","20222170"," You can watch this at home. "
"20223050","20226530"," They're loading the boat with zero dates for that are worthless right here."
"20227710","20229950"," They're loading the boats on them right now."
"20230150","20233530"," Like actively adding tens of thousands of calls right here. "
"20234250","20237670"," With that, what's that doing is taking dealers price down."
"20238510","20239670"," You're not going to catch the squeeze."
"20239830","20241670"," You're not going to see this get filled in here. "
"20243030","20244630"," They'll stay below 480."
"20247050","20248730"," They're just loading up right now."
"20249450","20250730"," You can actually see it in real time. "
"20254000","20257720"," 485,000 calls."
"20258620","20263060"," Zero dates being added for pennies to stop price from going any higher."
"20263060","20272760"," So Disney has a"
"20272760","20275620"," 5% implied move. "
"20276260","20277840"," We're going to look at Disney really quick."
"20286630","20288070"," It's a one minute chart on Disney."
"20291320","20294140"," I did trade back up to this 89 again, huh?"
"20294500","20295640"," Went right back up here again. "
"20296480","20298100"," Another exit for bulls."
"20300720","20302280"," Just so you can see this."
"20305110","20307290"," Two exits given to bulls up here. "
"20308630","20310330"," An exit given the bulls."
"20310370","20312870"," An exit given the bulls to the upside."
"20314690","20316810"," I traded this one right here. "
"20316950","20317490"," It's really nice."
"20319890","20324090"," Another exit for bulls right here on the open today on Disney."
"20325070","20327150"," I'm trading right in the middle of the pack right now. "
"20341240","20344480"," Disney is sitting right now on its daily trigger."
"20345220","20348460"," I'm going to look on the long term on Disney on Velo."
"20349280","20350340"," It's bottoming. "
"20350340","20355920"," I wanted to be aware of this that Disney isn't a bottoming."
"20358080","20362560"," Whether you like or dislike Disney, I want you to know that it's at a buy zone."
"20364380","20367820"," Now we had this previous low of $85 down here. "
"20369020","20373760"," And I thought that was good enough to buy options on."
"20375260","20378100"," There are bulls that want to buy it at $74."
"20379220","20381200"," It's a way down here. "
"20383380","20384640"," They want the cheapies."
"20391520","20395840"," I mean, this is how cheap this is where the stink bit is down here."
"20402020","20404620"," So this is the stink bit on Disney. "
"20405060","20407060"," This is where like a Disney bull wants to get bullish."
"20407840","20411020"," So if you're a Disney bull, all right, I want to own this for my kids."
"20412040","20413200"," I want to buy down there. "
"20413480","20415000"," Hell yeah, 100%."
"20417200","20419740"," So if there's any chance to buy down here, I would buy it."
"20421820","20426880"," So Disney bulls, like real bulls, like these are guys that own this ship 20, 30 years. "
"20427760","20431620"," I want to own it for my kids for the next 10 to 15 years."
"20433440","20435320"," So anything down here, I'll take it."
"20446780","20448080"," Do I think they get this?"
"20449720","20450120"," No. "
"20452720","20453600"," No, I don't."
"20453780","20454520"," But it is Disney."
"20455840","20460760"," One of the awesome things about Disney is when it moves, it moves, right?"
"20461040","20462860"," It moves up and down violently. "
"20463320","20464540"," It's like it's like a BA."
"20465480","20466240"," It moves."
"20466600","20467680"," It loves to move. "
"20468600","20473180"," So one of the good things about Disney knowing that it moves is like Tesla, right?"
"20473440","20477640"," Not as much as Tesla, but you know that if it has a violent move down, it's going to get"
"20477640","20477860"," bought."
"20478340","20481880"," You know that if it gets a violent move up, you can sell it."
"20482420","20482480"," Right?"
"20482640","20483860"," It's knowns about Disney. "
"20485660","20490340"," Great trading stock, and you know, fucks you when you least expect it, right?"
"20508680","20509240"," All right."
"20509240","20509820"," I'm sorry."
"20510040","20512600"," I'm in a position in TMF too. "
"20513240","20515760"," I want to make sure that my position is okay in TMF."
"20516860","20518500"," I got that for the 11th."
"20518580","20520860"," So I'm like, okay, it looks okay. "
"20521380","20523000"," I don't mind it here."
"20523560","20524920"," So Disney, this is the daily trigger."
"20527840","20533570"," They're holding me hostage in the TMF trade. "
"20540920","20543740"," There's also something to be said here for."
"20546780","20563850"," We've also got some pretty"
"20563850","20565350"," big bearishness up here."
"20566650","20568390"," Well, it's not big bearishness. "
"20568950","20570650"," This orange box right here."
"20570750","20574290"," This is going to be an emotional level."
"20574450","20576290"," Call it emotional on Disney. "
"20577610","20580050"," So you have a motion here up here, okay?"
"20580590","20582350"," Price is attracted to it."
"20583490","20586350"," And then we've got the Disney bulls down here."
"20586470","20587070"," That's what they want. "
"20587330","20598420"," Now you also have the implied 5 "
"20598420","20600880","% move is the orange box on Disney."
"20602060","20604600"," So this is the upside move on Disney here."
"20605160","20610160"," So right here, if you're going to get a good report on Disney, you're going to expect a move to"
"20610160","20611380"," this 92 and change. "
"20611460","20615260"," So if you wanted calls, zero day calls at this close right now, next 15 minutes."
"20615860","20617620"," I don't think you should."
"20618160","20627390"," But if you own Disney, the underlying and you want to cash out, put a cell somewhere around like"
"20627390","20630950"," $92, maybe $91.90 or something like that. "
"20631610","20635690"," If you want to take money and run and you still haven't done that, that's where that target is."
"20655580","20661210"," 8266 is the implied move to the downside."
"20661670","20663990"," We'll just do two of these upside implied move. "
"20674240","20675560"," So not so bad, right?"
"20675740","20677000"," To the downside, not so bad."
"20680260","20682360"," So you can see this as we come into the bell here."
"20684460","20686100"," Disney bulls want to buy down here. "
"20688200","20690520"," Expected move to the upside 92 and some change."
"20691440","20697000"," Downside expected move 82.90. So puts could print pretty well here, right?"
"20697240","20701120"," Puts could print fairly well if you got them outside the money."
"20701900","20704240"," The next expiry and you blast down here. "
"20704240","20708960"," You have fat payday on the put side for Disney."
"20709420","20713240"," So I see the thesis for why someone would want the puts."
"20713380","20714820"," The puts are going to pay better than the calls. "
"20715540","20719560"," If you're implied move to the upside is in line with the weekly."
"20720880","20726500"," You're going to expect, you're going to expect, you know, like you're not going to get your calls"
"20726500","20726800"," paid."
"20727420","20730340"," So you need a really big, good Disney. "
"20730340","20734260"," You know, really good Disney ER today."
"20734420","20735360"," This is the one minute chart on Disney."
"20735880","20738840"," I don't think you're going to see anything here between now and until 430. "
"20739520","20743820"," So I'm not expecting giant moves here on Disney until 4.35 o'clock."
"20744280","20747100"," I don't think you have a way to trade this on S&P 500."
"20748040","20751000"," Watch enough ESL off right now in the background. "
"20752860","20755160"," So just into this down here, right?"
"20755380","20758340"," Any of this stuff for Disney will get back to S&P real quick in a second."
"20759740","20762780"," So 92 36 to the upside."
"20762780","20768500"," It would seem like the options on puts would be the better printer on Disney and it is closed. "
"20768500","20774320"," So I'm going to go with the bears on this one on Disney for the downside move and hopefully they"
"20774320","20778540"," can get an outside moved outside of the expected range down to the $76."
"20779080","20781060"," Let me get back to Spy real quick because it's bleeding right now."
"20781940","20783480"," Down 282 right now. "
"20783520","20784060"," Look at that blood."
"20784900","20786640"," Into spy right now."
"20786640","20790840"," Like full on blood here into spy. "
"20791260","20796560"," You can see it with the zero date options that were being bought into this closed forcing the"
"20796560","20797740"," market lower right now."
"20797940","20805040"," Just full on force to the downside on spoos trading 445 78 right now."
"20805960","20808420"," No holding above here either, right?"
"20808660","20810680"," We said we talked about needing to see this hold. "
"20811340","20812900"," No holding on the hourly trigger."
"20813240","20814800"," Bloodbath it rejected up here."
"20815820","20821160"," Stacked the market with zero date calls at 480 and bloodbath to the depths of hell. "
"20822120","20824240"," Matter of fact, I'm going to try to buy here again."
"20824420","20824820"," So hold on."
"20838860","20839900"," Hold on. "
"20840100","20840460"," Hold on."
"20840680","20840900"," Hold on."
"20850160","20852080"," So much drama bears. "
"20852360","20853840"," Look at all that drama down there."
"20868300","20869840"," Adding to my position right now."
"20875300","20877560"," Might get more blood into this bell here. "
"20878060","20882620"," Just adding some calls for tomorrow."
"20882620","20885260"," I'm not adding anything into Friday."
"20885280","20886980"," I'm closed out of everything for Friday. "
"20887360","20889360"," I'm just working on one date right now."
"20889640","20892220"," And then I've got call spreads for September."
"20896680","20899000"," So much so much anger down here. "
"20899880","20903560"," Someone's actively in the options buying like two cents, one cent."
"20904640","20906840"," Call options, tens of thousands of them."
"20907280","20909780"," Forcing the market down right now into the closing bell. "
"20918880","20924200"," I've got four fifty twos, four forty eights for tomorrow's firing."
"20929750","20930570"," Man, I'll tell you what."
"20930670","20931890"," The CPI better be horrible. "
"20933290","20938550"," The CPI better come in like eggs are trading for twenty dollars or something."
"20942570","20944450"," The CPI better come in like double."
"20953150","20954650"," Told you was going down Chase. "
"20958730","20959830"," Told you wasn't going up there."
"20959950","20960610"," Too many calls, man."
"20960750","20962270"," They're at some of the backgrounds adding calls. "
"20962670","20963250"," It's not allowing."
"20963250","20966230"," So they're not allowing us to trade four forty eight."
"20968300","20969740"," They're not allowing us to men. "
"20970460","20973100"," They're manipulating the options chain right now."
"20991470","20992370"," I got one more buy."
"20992570","20994570"," I want to do them waiting to see what this close is. "
"20995030","20996490"," We've got eight minutes left."
"21007310","21009090"," So I added to a position right here."
"21009650","21013430"," And I'm going to look for any kind of weakness into this bell to add to that as well. "
"21019620","21022080"," That's CPI better be like triple hot."
"21023940","21025280"," Triple hot CPI."
"21029140","21031340"," Eggs better be selling for like ten dollars. "
"21040060","21041580"," I don't know if it's dealers doing it."
"21041660","21042120"," It could be dealers."
"21042160","21044220"," It could be somebody with a short or something. "
"21044860","21045880"," Someone's doing it in the background."
"21046740","21048560"," I was watching them come in at the end here."
"21049360","21052380"," They're just slamming the buy button on like penny, penny calls. "
"21052740","21052920"," Too many."
"21053980","21055280"," There's no way to print them."
"21055480","21056680"," They're not going to fucking print them. "
"21057200","21060700"," I'm going to take that upside out trade, send this down."
"21061840","21062800"," No way."
"21062920","21063320"," No way. "
"21063380","21063700"," I've done it."
"21063820","21064480"," I've tried to do it."
"21064640","21065700"," I've gotten caught doing that. "
"21067440","21071160"," I've gotten caught buying zero dates for like hundreds of thousands."
"21071700","21072200"," Maybe not hundreds."
"21072560","21077360"," Thirty to a hundred thousand dollars in zero dates and they automatically just hammer me down"
"21077360","21078440"," automatically. "
"21087760","21091700"," CPI usually squeeze up into almost always squeeze up into it."
"21108170","21112150"," All the way back down trading four forty six eleven right now."
"21113070","21115230"," I'm trading off of the daily trigger. "
"21118480","21119820"," Volatility on the daily trigger."
"21134020","21139580"," Four forty eights, four forty twos, even more blood."
"21142120","21143440"," Make it as bloody as you want. "
"21177010","21178630"," Bring this back so you can see it."
"21183440","21184420"," Give you guys some context."
"21187950","21189590"," That's two right there. "
"21211130","21215290"," I'm going to end up spending all this money that I made today on calls again today."
"21215290","21231760"," Like every dollar"
"21231760","21237160"," I made today, I'm likely whatever this pie, these last bars, they don't probably put me in all of"
"21237160","21238940"," my winnings in on calls."
"21258200","21258680"," Sorry. "
"21258900","21260840"," I got to be able to see the screen to see what happens there."
"21268380","21272980"," You better get the worst CPI report ever tomorrow."
"21273660","21276360"," It has to be like the most dog shit CPI. "
"21279300","21289160"," It has to be super gnarly because if it's not, if it is not,"
"21289720","21303250"," there it"
"21303250","21303730"," is right there."
"21303810","21304550"," I've got it here for you."
"21311620","21313280"," Give me like one more red bar down. "
"21313500","21315580"," I would actually take the happy with the red bar down here."
"21319500","21320800"," I'm going to watch this really close."
"21365240","21366280"," No fast fingering. "
"21382040","21383880"," I didn't catch anything good on that."
"21384200","21387540"," That's like I'm only like, I only got a penny on that."
"21408220","21409040"," Oh, there we go. "
"21409080","21409560"," We're going up."
"21418270","21419510"," Give me that one more."
"21419710","21420330"," Give me that red bar. "
"21420650","21421610"," I'll buy all that too."
"21422870","21425430"," There we go."
"21433530","21435070"," There we go. "
"21438150","21439930"," Some buying calls down here."
"21440030","21448330"," I just bought more calls for $1.6 and $1.2. Now it's kind of weird in there."
"21451230","21453270"," I'm loading the fuck up right now though. "
"21454790","21455230"," Okay."
"21455350","21456890"," Let's see what Disney is doing after the bell."
"21457250","21459630"," Disney up 49 cents after the bell right now. "
"21459710","21462650"," This is Disney up 48 cents."
"21464370","21467130"," Spy up 27 cents after the bell right now."
"21469470","21471470"," Disney up 48 cents. "
"21471930","21472790"," 24 cents."
"21473430","21475350"," Spoons up 25 cents after the bell."
"21476170","21485980"," I didn't do"
"21485980","21486800"," plug today either. "
"21487020","21492800"," Did I plug up after the bell right now?"
"21492960","21496440"," Disney up 0.3. Spoons up 34."
"21496920","21498440"," 32 cents right now after the bell."
"21498660","21499520"," There's spoons right here. "
"21500800","21502940"," I spent I think everything I made today."
"21502940","21505280"," I know I'm in for at least five or six K in here."
"21505460","21509090"," So for tomorrow. "
"21509430","21521890"," So I know I'm either I'm either flat on the day with the spy in or Disney up"
"21521890","21523130"," 0.9 cents right now."
"21524190","21526110"," Still I don't think there's news on Disney."
"21532960","21538480"," The order is focused on investments that can convert into tangible benefits with capital such as"
"21538480","21543380"," private equity and venture capital as well as joint ventures and greenfield investments. "
"21547440","21550960"," Trade 88 41 right now on Disney."
"21560730","21565870"," Representative at Maxine Waters is deeply concerned with paypal stable coin launch."
"21566090","21567570"," Get free daily point. "
"21567790","21569150"," What is that?"
"21569550","21571510"," Is she short paypal or something?"
"21571830","21572570"," What does she have?"
"21572670","21573950"," Like a bunch of fucking puts on PayPal."
"21589260","21592120"," Trade 88 70 on the high just then."
"21600540","21602240"," Plug up 20 cents after hours. "
"21602460","21604220"," Disney up 54 cents after hours."
"21619740","21622160"," Spying up 41 cents after hours."
"21622980","21625940"," You know I might have to take the money on these fucking calls today. "
"21626860","21628380"," Look at spy really quick."
"21629620","21631280"," Just see what's going on here."
"21635520","21638320"," Trade a dollar 20 right now on 448. "
"21639960","21643920"," 41s are at 40 cents."
"21649900","21653200"," 42 excuse me 27 cents on 42."
"21653820","21654780"," Wrong strike. "
"21663600","21666120"," It's a big giant red bar down there after the bell."
"21668520","21673820"," Spy now our Disney was up at 49 now down to 47 49 right now."
"21679580","21680960"," What you guys take on Disney?"
"21681200","21685000"," You guys think we trade 89 or do you think we trade 74. "
"21688020","21689420"," I'm not short Disney or anything."
"21689600","21690800"," I'm not long or short Disney."
"21691100","21694820"," I want to buy Disney if I can today at 74. "
"21695400","21697220"," So if we went down to 74 I'd buy it."
"21697220","21705460"," Hey you're welcome Will."
"21711100","21713880"," Yeah if we see like if I see Disney go down there. "
"21714780","21716460"," Oh I want to own it down there."
"21717180","21719160"," I don't the implied move is much higher."
"21719340","21725140"," The implied move is only 82 on this option on this expiry right down here. "
"21725880","21728980"," So there are bulls saying that it's going to 74 to 76."
"21730620","21738740"," Way down here not bulls but it's not showing up right here."
"21739240","21741680"," But it's right right where that yellow box is right here. "
"21744620","21747180"," Trade 85.20 on the downside right now."
"21747280","21751740"," Now trade 85.20. I don't think there's a report out yet."
"21752440","21755160"," I'm looking right now and I'm not seeing any reports on Disney. "
"21762520","21765600"," This all looks like take money and run dip buying."
"21769620","21771820"," This looks like people that are long and short."
"21772900","21774460"," But I'm not anything right now in Disney. "
"21774800","21775600"," I want to own it though."
"21776640","21779960"," So if it goes down there if it squeezes all the way down to like $74."
"21780880","21782500"," And we'll put an order in for it. "
"21791240","21793520"," Yeah the dividend is pissed off investors too."
"21794820","21798600"," And then what else was wiki said something about Hulu."
"21799060","21799700"," How do they hide that?"
"21799880","21800920"," They haven't discussed that at all. "
"21808610","21812230"," According to sources Biden is unlikely to attend the ASEAN Summit."
"21812830","21814850"," On five forty eight cents right now."
"21815230","21817590"," I'm actually entrapped five of a dollar twenty seven. "
"21818310","21820610"," Trade 88.78 just then."
"21822600","21824740"," Disney all over the place right now."
"21827910","21828350"," It's weird. "
"21828550","21829310"," It's like you're a bullet."
"21829450","21831390"," It's like what do you want to do on earnings?"
"21831690","21834270"," Well I want to look for shit that goes for that burns to buy."
"21835390","21842080"," What do you want to see Disney at 90?"
"21842460","21842480"," No. "
"21842680","21842940"," Fuck no."
"21843040","21844300"," I want to see it at 74 76."
"21851220","21853080"," It's by 46 cents right now. "
"21861200","21862680"," I saw that Verizon news."
"21862960","21864520"," I still own Verizon too."
"21866160","21867520"," Piece of shit stock. "
"21870130","21874230"," It's one of the things that was littering my account right now that I'm like damn you."

"22091120","22092900"," CPI point two percent. "
"22094040","22095320"," And then core point two."
"22096260","22101880"," The one that I'm looking at of course is core CPI year over year at four point eight percent."
"22102060","22102700"," This is the one. "
"22103540","22106560"," This one right here is the one that's important to me."

"22115340","22115740"," Down."
"22115920","22117040"," I don't want to see that number higher."

"22127020","22128860"," Yeah, we got Disney still trade."
"22129120","22132700"," Now it's back to almost zero kind of kind of sort of."
"22135020","22137060"," This is the number that I'm looking at for tomorrow. "
"22137060","22139920"," This is the magic sauce and claim whatever they want."
"22139960","22142000"," But this is the one that has to do with."
"22142000","22146960"," With your rate hikes and pauses and all that kind of stuff. "
"22148080","22150240"," Some of the year over year stuff matters too."
"22151320","22152460"," But the core CPI."
"22152820","22153240"," This is the one. "
"22153360","22154160"," This is the magic sauce."
"22155120","22156160"," Or at least for me."
"22157520","22158940"," And you got a PPI. "
"22161100","22168820"," That one is the one that concerns me about this board keeps charging $130,000 for a truck."
"22170500","22172620"," The PPI is the one that's concerning."
"22173200","22174100"," That's what it's going to get. "
"22174300","22176000"," That one's going to crank at some point."
"22177020","22180180"," The next five years or so you wait to see that PPI start ripping."
"22198510","22200210"," Yeah, I think they cook the numbers too. "
"22201230","22202290"," I think they cook them too."
"22205200","22205880"," Maybe they don't."
"22206560","22207960"," You usually get two or three bumps. "
"22208840","22211620"," As inflation comes down, you usually get two or three."
"22212080","22213080"," That's called two."
"22213080","22216120"," Minimum two hot CPI reports. "
"22217020","22217960"," We're due for one."
"22218520","22219560"," We are due for one."
"22222860","22225140"," We're due like we're definitely due for one. "
"22228780","22230660"," No action right now in Disney."
"22231680","22233880"," Disney down $2 on no news."
"22234620","22236680"," They were up a bunch to a no news. "
"22238260","22240420"," Spy ramping right now into this close."
"22240980","22242460"," You better hope for a hot fucking report."
"22242940","22244160"," Like hot sauce report. "
"22249910","22250810"," Two minutes left."
"22251390","22253870"," Makes me wonder if I should take some of this off in here."
"22257670","22260010"," That was a pretty nice fucking rip right there. "
"22262200","22264100"," I might take a little bit off."
"22264260","22265240"," Not all of it, just a little bit."
"22265320","22267660"," This is a pretty good rip right here. "
"22290660","22291780"," One minute left here."
"22307630","22310150"," I'm trying to shave some off right now to this bell."
"22310690","22314090"," They're like dropping me a penny than another penny than another penny. "
"22321200","22322880"," That's a nice 15 minute trade right here."
"22331310","22332670"," I still have calls on for tomorrow."
"22332910","22333550"," Not all of them though. "
"22333550","22335230"," I have pretty big exposure down here."
"22340010","22340510"," Woah."
"22349520","22352380"," So taking a look at the market wrap for today's session. "
"22352460","22352840"," Oh no really."
"22352860","22354920"," Sliding big tech and higher energy price."
"22355020","22355320"," I don't know. "
"22355700","22356480"," I don't need the call report."
"22356500","22361120"," There's a hell of a data that will help shape the outlook for the Federal Reserve's next steps."
"22361940","22366040"," After briefly wiping out its losses, the S&P 500 finished near session. "
"22366280","22375400"," If we were on a high right now and we got like a neutral or slightly high report I would"
"22375400","22377120"," expect us to sell heavy and hard."
"22377480","22379100"," Like hard boom boom selling."
"22380180","22383120"," So if you're like ready. "
"22386350","22389670"," So if we're trading up into a CPI report right."
"22390970","22395590"," That CPI report better be really like cold right."
"22395950","22396610"," Really cold. "
"22397150","22398290"," Really cold."
"22399850","22402070"," For continuation of the upside right."
"22402770","22406150"," Trade down into CPI reports right. "
"22407520","22409900"," It better be really hot."
"22411640","22412180"," Get it."
"22414000","22419160"," So you have to expect our hope tomorrow if you're a bear that you get a really hot CPI report. "
"22420040","22422480"," Can't be a cold report."
"22422640","22424300"," If it's cold report we're going to rip faces off."
"22427700","22429720"," Yeah you see that that ghost print there on the 15. "
"22431810","22432570"," So there you go."
"22432710","22433530"," So all of you guys tomorrow."
"22434470","22436290"," I don't know what's going to happen here with Disney. "
"22436790","22438610"," I want to buy this if it goes down."
"22440650","22442910"," No nothing really happening right now in Disney."
"22443090","22445050"," This just looks like taking the money and running. "
"22445790","22450750"," Let's see it up here in this 88 79 on the upside 84 64 on the downside."
"22451870","22454610"," I want to see a bloodbath in."
"22455170","22459490"," I want to see a bloodbath in Disney if possible at 430. "
"22459910","22460790"," Maybe I'll stick around here."
"22460870","22461250"," It's only 30."
"22461370","22462430"," It's only 13 minutes left. "
"22462610","22463550"," So we'll wait and see."
"22467570","22469090"," I'm saying like really nastiness."
"22469110","22470250"," I'm not sticking around for the. "
"22470450","22471590"," I don't want to hear but I hear talk."
"22482800","22483920"," Oh they're going to rip it down."
"22484140","22484780"," I'll tell you what. "
"22484900","22485540"," I'll tell you right now."
"22485660","22487680"," If you don't get a fucking hot report."

"22490880","22494300"," It's going to be like straight green bars up fucking 70 points."
"22496120","22496480"," Sorry."
"22497480","22498920"," I don't see it. "
"22499060","22501960"," So I think you need a really hot or really hot report."
"22502780","22503640"," We're due for one."
"22503780","22505980"," So if you get a really hot report will continue down. "
"22505980","22508880"," You get anything that like beats or anything like that."
"22508920","22510220"," It means that they're doing their job."
"22510580","22511360"," I know that's fake. "
"22512080","22513520"," I get that that's fake."
"22515400","22517000"," I understand your point."
"22519020","22522800"," But if they're like patting themselves in the back and they're like yeah we're bringing inflation"
"22522800","22523320"," down. "
"22528200","22532860"," You don't get like down if the inflation before is good or down to three place."
"22534320","22537520"," Or down if you know like I always like that argument."
"22537700","22539800"," It's like the arguments always like okay. "
"22540020","22540740"," So what if this happens?"
