"59090","60330"," Check one two."
"90380","91020"," Good morning. "
"93840","94960"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"98090","99330"," Okay, what else are you going on here?"
"101070","102270"," You just taking boys and girls?"
"104210","113440"," I don't know what this always happens to me."
"113500","114900"," I don't know what this happens for this morning."
"115020","115480"," Good morning, everybody. "
"116200","117240"," I'm going to switch it right over right away."
"117340","117760"," Okay, hold on."
"117760","119800"," I'm going to turn that right off. "
"120640","121440"," Get right into it."
"124760","125280"," How's that?"
"125480","127300"," It's wild out there right now, isn't it?"
"127780","129180"," It is wild out there."
"131160","132140"," Everything is crazy. "
"133620","134260"," I'm sitting here."
"134380","136320"," I think I might be shadowed in by Twitter."
"136540","138200"," I'm not exactly sure what's going on with Twitter. "
"139040","139320"," I don't know."
"139360","144040"," They've relaunched Twitter blue, so maybe they're just telling 10,000 follower accounts above."
"145000","146900"," I guess they have this line here. "
"146900","151760"," In the stand where they're telling."
"152160","156420"," If you got traction normally, you're not getting it anymore."
"157000","158640"," We'll talk about that this morning at some point. "
"159100","159880"," It's kind of weird."
"161280","164320"," I want to be a greaser, not a sosh."
"166280","168240"," I don't want to get Twitter blue. "
"168460","169560"," I'll be honest with you, I don't."
"173000","176940"," There's some mechanics going on in the background of Twitter."
"177360","179160"," It's definitely affecting Twitter. "
"179780","184480"," My account has been going on for a couple of weeks, but it was ramped into the launch of the"
"184480","186480"," new launch of Twitter blue, whatever."
"186840","187920"," We'll talk about it this morning."
"191200","198860"," You saw you saw indictments yesterday being handed down against some some very well known Finn"
"198860","199620"," Twitters, right?"
"201340","207360"," You know, it's interesting about that, too, is Mr. Zack Morris has come back twice now, right?"
"207560","208260"," Didn't he have a different?"
"209040","218690"," I think I've known that guy for some for some time, and I think"
"218690","224730"," I've known him on social media in two different capacities, but I'm not exactly positive on that. "
"225430","226410"," Don't quote me on that."
"227090","233790"," Someone was saying something about him yesterday, and I didn't say anything about it, but let me"
"233790","234770"," just check some here."
"234770","235890"," If you love and control room. "
"237090","239290"," I got YouTube sometimes acts kind of wonky."
"241150","244070"," And I got to do some stuff as we get as we get started here."
"244650","247430"," Make sure you don't have any of the Russian porn bots in here. "
"249150","249950"," This morning."
"251710","252830"," Okay, you'll learn here."
"254150","257230"," All right, so we're going to slap that on so that only certain people can speak. "
"258350","259110"," Subscribers."
"259769","260829"," Can speak."
"261610","262670"," Let's start with yesterday. "
"263530","266130"," So on Monday night."
"267790","269730"," On Monday night, right?"
"270010","276730"," I have an old friend that contact me Monday night, and I got drunk as a skunk."
"277530","279270"," And on Tuesday morning. "
"280570","282630"," On Tuesday morning to do the live stream."
"282830","285210"," I was I was still I was like, I'm hungover."
"285710","288550"," But then I realized that I was probably still drunk in the morning. "
"288930","290710"," Matter of fact, I got a bottle of for that."
"290810","293110"," Sitting around here somewhere."
"293670","295070"," And when we finished with the for that. "
"295150","296530"," That was it was all over."
"296670","298250"," I was like, there's no way I'm going on live."
"298970","300010"," Although I was very happy. "
"301170","302650"," Yesterday for that brief moment."
"302830","304710"," We broke through that quarter and quote channel."
"307190","308730"," We haven't done that at all this year. "
"309350","310330"," So that was that that was a."
"311570","314250"," If the bulls had any kind of a win this year, that was it."
"315150","319570"," That was that one like that was like the whale jumping out of the ocean or up in the sky"
"319570","320430"," when the jets flying."
"321210","324030"," Then flops back down just to let you know that the bulls are still here. "
"324370","325150"," I know that was great."
"325970","327170"," We'll talk about that too."
"327490","329210"," We'll talk about that whole incident yesterday. "
"329210","330410"," The reversion."
"330710","332970"," You guys got my week weekly brief, right?"
"333750","338710"," I told you that no matter what happened on CPI that we would come right back to that we would"
"338710","339530"," revert back to."
"340890","341950"," Study as she goes. "
"343150","345030"," So that shouldn't have been of surprise."
"346450","348110"," Yesterday at all to any of you."
"348630","352750"," That we would revert as well that I think I said in that week in that brief. "
"353290","355250"," I said, I don't care if it goes up or down."
"355870","358230"," And then I also talked to you in the brief about."
"358790","360250"," I think on Twitter, I said. "
"361370","364570"," You know, inflation is coming down by their metric and."
"365350","370230"," It would really have to be double triple for any kind of an argument that it isn't coming down."
"370550","371750"," I don't care about all the. "
"372050","375970"," I saw people this morning pointing out small things like rent and this and that."
"376290","377150"," I don't fucking care."
"378110","379190"," Neither do they. "
"379530","380570"," They're a hammer on a nail."
"380730","382050"," I think I said that at some point."
"382650","383830"," That they're a hammer on a nail. "
"384030","386870"," They don't care about your little let's investigate CPI."
"387510","389230"," I saw so much of that shit yesterday."
"389650","390790"," Maybe I'm going to fucking throw up. "
"391010","391870"," Sorry for swearing, but."
"392690","395630"," I was like, it doesn't matter."
"396210","396990"," Flation's coming down. "
"398190","399850"," What's crazy is."
"400010","403190"," No one ever wants to talk about unemployment ever because it's bad."
"403470","405070"," I mean, people have a hard life. "
"405930","409350"," People are, you know, people are working harder, working more to try to make ends meet."
"410570","411810"," Inflation is still high."
"413190","417950"," So when you tell people that you want to see mass unemployment, you know, that's not, that's not"
"417950","418510"," nice to say. "
"418790","420510"," But that is what said behind closed doors."
"421350","424790"," And the fact that Janet Yellen doesn't say it publicly is bullshit too."
"425230","430230"," You know, and the people that can make a decision about your life or can really hurt your life. "
"431610","433730"," Aren't public about the things that they're trying to do."
"434610","436070"," You know, it's kind of wild."
"437130","439330"," Anyways, let's get all past all that. "
"440330","441350"," Let's go to the top here."
"441470","441830"," Let me go to the."
"443630","446110"," See, I got, I was, dude, I think I was still drunk yesterday. "
"446330","447170"," I was like, there's no way."
"447990","450090"," It's crazy too is that I thought yesterday."
"450770","453290"," I was like, you know what I'll do is my wife had been asking me. "
"453370","457450"," She's like, if you ever want me to set up a stream for you, if you're not not here or"
"457450","458530"," something, something comes up."
"458930","461990"," So now I'm like, all right, I'm going to teach you how to get this thing rolling for me."
"462330","463350"," I was like, there's no way. "
"463350","464810"," I'm going to set this stream up."
"464810","466110"," I'm like, I'm going to get on there and I'll be drunk."
"466110","467790"," I'm like, no way that's happening. "
"470370","470730"," Okay."
"470950","471310"," So let's see."
"472070","472970"," Give me a second here. "
"474910","476930"," Let me close this out for a minute."
"478750","480630"," So first, let's say some good mornings here."
"482510","483470"," Good morning, Winky. "
"483650","484030"," How are you?"
"484690","485370"," Good morning, Matthew."
"485610","485890"," How are you?"
"487810","489030"," How are you, Matthew?"
"490250","491090"," Dio, how are you?"
"492490","493390"," Let me see."
"493390","497350"," I would have paid nights and I'd still only see content from people I follow but not being able to"
"497350","501070"," control the nasty crap he was showing me every day was doing a real number on me. "
"501790","502230"," Yeah."
"502230","505310"," So like the Twitter thing, I've got some weirdness going on."
"505430","509070"," I've got like people being muted. "
"509910","512650"," I feel like a control is being wonky."
"513309","519549"," Sometimes I try to post and I can't post video and then it comes back and works."
"520570","523390"," That happened when I posted the Tesla, the Elon Musk videos. "
"527310","530710"," So there's something going on the background of Twitter and then I think there's even a."
"532690","536690"," I'm going to assume that if you don't pay for Twitter blue and you've got low, like you've got like"
"536690","538490"," 100 followers or 1000 followers."
"539510","542390"," They're not going to, I don't think they're going to, I don't think they're going to like."
"545550","551550"," I feel what it's called. "
"551550","553510"," They're gaining followers or you have a post."
"554210","558790"," You know, they get some followers or whatever or some likes or something that at some point they're"
"558790","559210"," going to start."
"559890","562790"," Ask for a trip and you try to force you. "
"562910","563610"," I could care less."
"566390","570030"," And this morning I saw some more Elon Musk news and."
"570770","574010"," I'm telling you that I was just talking to a friend and I said. "
"575330","578910"," I've been a fanboy of Elon for a long time and it's getting to that point."
"578910","580370"," It really is getting to that point of."
"583440","584040"," Hold on a second. "
"584120","586540"," We work on this book map for you so I can straighten it out for you."
"590060","590560"," Oh, no."
"590760","591960"," Dude, I have a I have a computer. "
"592300","592980"," I like Microsoft."
"593480","594720"," Hey, we'd like to restart your computer."
"595600","596000"," It's like. "
"600800","601740"," Alright, let's get some."
"609390","611670"," We'll talk before the how many minutes we got to the bell."
"611870","613090"," We got nine minutes to the bell. "
"613750","615090"," So I'm all over the place this morning."
"616650","618470"," We'll talk about Twitter though at some point."
"618930","620750"," I don't know what is going on. "
"621450","622870"," I don't know if it's just he knows."
"623290","625570"," I don't know if he just knows that the stock is going down."
"626470","627610"," Per minute I was like. "
"629190","633290"," Maybe he's just airing all this dirty laundry now while he can while the stock's going down."
"634030","636450"," And so just keep airing it, naring it, naring it."
"638170","641670"," You don't know if he shortened the stock to and selling selling behind the scenes. "
"641950","644630"," But I don't think that was part of my process."
"644630","647050"," But as all this stuff is coming out."
"648430","649490"," Sometimes you make enemies. "
"649850","652230"," We'll talk about this later in depth about Elon."
"653970","655190"," It's not good though."
"655510","657970"," Like the alarm bells in my head are going off. "
"658430","663050"," Like, you know, when these alarm bells go off and they're not the good ones."
"664450","669390"," And you like to have these different tolerance levels and it's right there."
"669650","670130"," And I think. "
"672910","674710"," It's like that for most people at this point."
"674930","677070"," And I'm even aware of it."
"677250","678330"," So I'm going to be honest with you. "
"682130","683810"," Well, we're going to talk about a bunch of stuff that's right."
"683950","686210"," I'll show you guys every FOMC I think for this year."
"686550","687330"," Fed rate decision. "
"690450","694310"," Fed rate that the each of great decision meeting."
"695570","697270"," I'll show you what happened in those days."
"697270","700310"," So you can see what to expect today and tomorrow. "
"701670","703910"," They have some some awareness of what to expect today."
"704790","708510"," So if you're tuning in, I'll show you some some figures and stuff."
"708950","710790"," At some point this morning, we'll go over all that stuff. "
"711470","712670"," We also have at vol."
"712990","716350"," Volatility was coming in today at one o'clock this afternoon."
"717630","718710"," This guy's a pro man. "
"718850","719150"," This guy."
"719850","721330"," I'm not going to tell his whole story."
"722130","723730"," I'll leave up to him what he wants to tell. "
"724190","725250"," This guy's a real pro."
"725410","726290"," This is the kind of guy that."
"730670","731470"," I don't know. "
"731550","734970"," I don't want to say because I don't know what he can say or can't say publicly."
"735930","738930"," About about his professional life and stuff like that."
"738950","739490"," So I'll leave it there. "
"739630","740370"," But I want you to know."
"741350","744250"," He's amongst a very small group of traders on."
"745090","746910"," Pin to it that are known. "
"749450","749810"," For."
"751650","755110"," All the shots these guys call come true like 90% of the time."
"757230","759710"," 95% of the time they know what's up. "
"761510","764370"," They're like a crew of pit traders or a crew of professionals."
"765710","767330"," All legit legit people."
"768030","769090"," So to have him on today. "
"770430","773590"," Is you know, that's something that you're not going to get anywhere else."
"773930","779790"," You're not going to get that kind of."
"780650","781790"," But it's rare to get. "
"783110","785990"," A market pro sitting down with you as you get to trade."
"786370","788370"," Probably the most important decision for."
"789690","790090"," 2023. "
"790130","790530"," Yep."
"790710","791390"," You know, the upcoming year."
"792490","794590"," So we'll have him on later this afternoon. "
"795370","798230"," I'll be having to take some breaks today to coordinate that."
"798490","801590"," And we got some some data for you guys to look at today."
"802190","803830"," And digest as the day begins. "
"803990","807030"," I do want you to know, as we open right here, I want to go through briefly."
"810170","814670"," What to be looking for off of this bell here or just some just some key things you guys got"
"814670","814950"," to know."
"815110","815270"," Okay. "
"815630","817790"," I mean, this is teed up right now."
"818030","820910"," We have not we the market is teed this up."
"823650","826390"," You know, this is this is it right here, right?"
"826650","830810"," This is this yellow line is the trend line that doesn't that's bullshit doesn't mean anything. "
"831710","832430"," We know it does."
"833310","834570"," We know it does, right?"
"836310","836970"," We know it."
"837030","837370"," We know it. "
"837370","837750"," We know in a day."
"840130","843050"," I want you to see this is the 200 right here, right?"
"843770","845450"," On a daily chart right here, right?"
"845550","845850"," We blast."
"846030","847550"," We blast it up full rejection. "
"847870","849250"," We'll talk about this rejection candle, too."
"850110","851790"," You see the double top in here."
"852730","854010"," Bears are going to tell you this, right?"
"854150","855590"," It's a big time double top here. "
"855630","856990"," You've got the downtrend going down."
"858590","860850"," You get underneath this this 200 day."
"861830","864050"," And you need to start counting all this stuff, right?"
"864190","866370"," When you when you look for a classic setups trading. "
"868510","871930"," Stuff like this and can't can't can't hold above here."
"872670","873150"," Right?"
"873330","874910"," No conviction here."
"875590","876070"," Right?"
"876590","877350"," This is all bad. "
"877510","879330"," I mean, this is looking kind of rough right here."
"879390","883190"," It's basically teed up for everything to go against you as a bull."
"884490","886170"," Leading into this thing. "
"887410","889670"," Leading into this FOMC right there."
"889810","892010"," Right there with with big sellers up here."
"892110","893150"," They rejected up here. "
"893770","895570"," This is your second rejection here."
"896230","900370"," If you get underneath the 200 day, the setup is just there, right?"
"901210","902270"," I hope you can see that."
"903730","905230"," It's not it's not that hard to see. "
"905350","906870"," You know that the implied ball is here."
"906950","909380"," You can see our trading range is just monster, right?"
"910650","914050"," And there can be a case that can be made as well for this for the bulls."
"915730","922550"," It how important this day is and where we will go off of any kind of perceived positivity by the"
"922550","922810"," market. "
"923070","923870"," We'll talk about that."
"924170","925810"," We'll rehash some of that stuff today with you as well."
"926890","928030"," What could actually be?"
"928190","928470"," That's funny. "
"928770","931230"," All these bears, these big bears, big high fall accounts."
"931530","931690"," I'm like."
"932510","934010"," They're showing you the yield curve. "
"934010","937990"," I'm like, man, the yield curve does not ever do not ever."
"938610","942770"," It's the it's it's not consistent at all in whether the market goes up or down."
"942770","949390"," The most consistent indicator you can look at is unemployment for finding a bottom. "
"950550","955270"," And we know I can show you historically where rates have just been ratcheted ratcheted and the"
"955270","956030"," market can go up."
"956670","959510"," If the fed can make you up the cult, if the economic."
"960870","961310"," Cult. "
"962410","965430"," Can make you believe that they're doing a good job."
"965610","966390"," The market will go up."
"966510","967150"," I promise you that. "
"967650","968790"," And they know this."
"970270","973150"," And this is even with tightening rates, they could ratchet rates."
"974690","979030"," And as long as the market believes that there isn't a problem underneath the hood, which, you know,"
"979050","980830"," you'll see bears saying, well, there is. "
"981810","986130"," With the yield curve, which I can show you."
"986650","987630"," That it doesn't."
"987950","988470"," It doesn't. "
"988870","991130"," There are times when it doesn't think of it."
"991230","992270"," If the fed can make you believe."
"993290","994390"," The market can go up. "
"995610","997810"," The only consistent only one."
"997890","998790"," I've checked all this stuff."
"999090","1001470"," Hey, we went back through and checked the yield curve last night. "
"1001470","1003190"," Just just a back test."
"1003190","1003870"," All this shit."
"1005110","1009450"," And if you want to see a bottom in this market near bull, you want to see that unemployment go"
"1009450","1009770"," up, man. "
"1009970","1010150"," You want it?"
"1010250","1013830"," You want to see like, that'll roll us over and blast us right down to the bottom."
"1014190","1015250"," You'll know that's bottom."
"1018260","1019520"," So anyways, just this stuff. "
"1019580","1020800"," I want you to see this stuff here."
"1020920","1021060"," Okay."
"1021460","1025819"," If you're a bull, you have every reason to be watching bears trying to step in. "
"1025819","1028140"," And short this market today into this."
"1029460","1030619"," Into this decision."
"1030859","1031900"," You can see it right here. "
"1031940","1034300"," You got a nice bull bear flag forming right up here, right?"
"1034700","1036760"," One, two, three, four days of it."
"1037099","1038980"," Just looking for a chance for it to come out."
"1039060","1040740"," You can see the big swing up here yesterday. "
"1041500","1044260"," Revert it right back down to that four, four thousand level."
"1044319","1045940"," I think I posted this yesterday morning."
"1046700","1049020"," And said expect a bounce off four thousand. "
"1049080","1050460"," You buy the dip on this, right?"
"1051100","1051860"," Until this is broken."
"1052820","1053620"," This is positive."
"1053620","1056560"," You want to see the bears need to get underneath this. "
"1058040","1060340"," The pivot point, though, is at four, three, eighty six."
"1060600","1062840"," It's the bull's job to get up and above this."
"1063240","1066180"," This pivot here and get break through this volatility level. "
"1066620","1068520"," The bears know that probably won't happen."
"1068520","1072200"," So they're coming in strong to try to push down, push down."
"1072980","1074400"," Get underneath our one. "
"1074540","1076060"," I'm going to show you our one in a five minute."
"1076580","1077720"," It's our one right here."
"1080200","1083360"," To then show it on a 15 minute chart right here, right?"
"1083360","1085100"," You get underneath this S one down here. "
"1086200","1088920"," You get underneath this two hundred and a 15 minute chart, man."
"1089000","1089680"," It's all over."
"1090060","1092600"," And you know what I'll do is I'll change some of this stuff for you right here. "
"1093300","1098280"," You can just check the, let's see if I can get a seven and a twenty one day, maybe."
"1101080","1102960"," Show us on a seven and a twenty."
"1103320","1104760"," I'll show the, hold on a second here. "
"1105440","1105820"," We'll get there."
"1106180","1107180"," Seven day, twenty day."
"1107940","1109000"," You can just take these off. "
"1111970","1119250"," And let's say I make that style size."
"1119490","1121250"," We'll make this a big one so you can see it."
"1121310","1122950"," We'll make this not rocket science for the day. "
"1126410","1127310"," Nice and easy."
"1128550","1129410"," We don't want that one."
"1129530","1129970"," We want this one. "
"1131350","1132730"," We want to turn this, let's say yellow."
"1135390","1137410"," Make this nice and easy for you guys today."
"1139910","1140350"," Done. "
"1141150","1141790"," Oh, man."
"1141890","1143010"," That's a horrible looking line."
"1144510","1144950"," Style. "
"1145430","1147330"," Is that size of it?"
"1147550","1148890"," This is size is thick."
"1149930","1150810"," We're doing wrong here."
"1151110","1151310"," Okay. "
"1151450","1152410"," There we go."
"1154630","1156230"," Just off the bell right here, right?"
"1156510","1157690"," You don't want to be getting out."
"1157850","1158970"," What's the twenty?"
"1161390","1163230"," You want to be staying on a five minute chart. "
"1166330","1169210"," You want to be trading above this red line right here."
"1169210","1169530"," Okay."
"1169910","1173350"," Very important for bulls to be trading off this off this red line. "
"1173450","1176530"," You can see the blast off right off the bell this morning."
"1177390","1178330"," It's a five minute chart."
"1178870","1180030"," Nice green buy bar. "
"1180790","1182110"," Bulls need to get above."
"1182710","1183490"," I want to say there."
"1189410","1191190"," Screw all this down here for you. "
"1191930","1194050"," The trade range is so huge today."
"1198140","1200120"," Just pay attention to this red line today."
"1200320","1200420"," Okay. "
"1200560","1202240"," You want to be trading above this red line today."
"1203460","1205040"," I'll put it back in the five minute here."
"1205040","1207320"," But one here. "
"1208040","1210320"," I don't know what this."
"1210940","1212440"," I don't know what's going on with this wonky."
"1212520","1213020"," It's over here. "
"1213500","1215260"," Well, this is this big line back here."
"1222840","1225340"," Bullsey to hold this pivot line on an inch rate chart."
"1225400","1226620"," This is what they're looking for, right?"
"1226800","1229960"," And I can assure you that the bear is going to be coming down here. "
"1230020","1232880"," They're trying to short all any kind of attempt above today."
"1233900","1237740"," So I'm going to say that I expect today to be a boring trading day."
"1238880","1240100"," Until we get the presser. "
"1240380","1242000"," Another presser, excuse me, the press release."
"1243460","1244960"," I'm going to resize this."
"1246340","1249260"," I'll put that ball. "
"1251480","1252580"," That book map up for you."
"1252900","1254260"," You see the solos already coming in, right?"
"1256140","1257540"," These shorts don't care."
"1257740","1261340"," These shorts think this market's rolling today. "
"1261640","1263460"," I don't blame them for thinking the market's rolling today."
"1273360","1274640"," They're stepping in right here."
"1274760","1275840"," They want a second here. "
"1282970","1284570"," Bears are like, nope."
"1287550","1288550"," It's hilarious to watch them."
"1288650","1290850"," They're like, actually a little bit lower, aren't they?"
"1290990","1291550"," They're like right here. "
"1292370","1294570"," Bears just don't care."
"1294750","1298880"," They're just like, they don't for a fact."
"1299100","1300060"," They're, I don't for a fact. "
"1300340","1301100"," The bears right now."
"1301260","1303060"," Just trying to hold on a second."
"1306120","1306920"," Right there. "
"1307600","1311360"," Look at that range."
"1313560","1315120"," It's 420 up here."
"1315540","1315900"," 415. "
"1317700","1318180"," 408."
"1318520","1318700"," 403."
"1319400","1319840"," This is huge. "
"1321780","1322800"," 397 down here."
"1323820","1326040"," 392 and 385 70."
"1326860","1329640"," We were just talking about this the other day like it was so far away. "
"1329800","1331080"," Remember how far away we thought this was?"
"1333690","1335670"," I think implied vols at 35 today."
"1336050","1338570"," It was at 30 on Friday or something."
"1338570","1339990"," It's just been cranking. "
"1340910","1343710"," We had major calls coming to the market yesterday."
"1343910","1347890"," I was working on those gamma models and I checked the."
"1349790","1351810"," I didn't realize how many people bought calls yesterday. "
"1352170","1353870"," It was insane."
"1354490","1357550"," People were buying just buying, buying, buying calls all day long yesterday."
"1358410","1359670"," Outside the money calls too. "
"1360410","1360910"," Much higher."
"1361190","1362350"," 420s, 430s."
"1363050","1364270"," I saw some 440s yesterday. "
"1365130","1366330"," If I can get that."
"1366970","1371770"," If I can pull that up for you at some point today, I will, but."
"1372550","1375510"," I was surprised that the call expansion of the market yesterday. "
"1376250","1377570"," It was wild to see."
"1388190","1390070"," That just holding it up this morning."
"1391130","1393490"," This big big support line down below. "
"1397800","1400840"," You can see 4100 above."
"1402400","1403920"," That's right up here at R2."
"1428340","1429640"," So, 410 up here. "
"1429840","1430220"," This is rough."
"1430640","1432540"," That's right here."
"1432620","1433780"," It's right around R2 up here. "
"1441230","1443570"," You should actually go back to a five minute for you."
"1445310","1448090"," You can bring this over and show you a better five minute."
"1461000","1466580"," Let's see this right in here. "
"1471480","1494580"," A second here."
"1513500","1515640"," This range is just stupid."
"1562900","1565340"," This range is actually difficult to actually capture. "
"1570620","1593030"," We're already at point, we're already at $1.10. I"
"1593030","1596670"," can't, I'm looking at the call structure and put structure right now."
"1596930","1600210"," Everything is, I'm looking at zero dates right now and there."
"1601650","1608850"," You know, one, two, three, four, five, six strikes out. "
"1609570","1611430"," Maybe look at the deltas on these things."
"1612950","1617370"," Take the 30, 31 delta, 407s are $1.80 right now."
"1618650","1621790"," 27 delta, 408s are $1.47 right now. "
"1622350","1626910"," This is insane price for an option right now for the moves that are being made."
"1632180","1632780"," All right."
"1632880","1633640"," Let's see what you guys are saying. "
"1633860","1634760"," Winky, what are you doing?"
"1634900","1635360"," Good morning, Joe."
"1635520","1636080"," John, how are you?"
"1636720","1639340"," I think there are enough big people with big money."
"1639440","1641080"," They want to get it back to least 3500. "
"1641080","1643400"," That'll go back 3500 at some point at the same time."
"1643460","1646800"," I still think we should be hit 415 by 1231."
"1647160","1648500"," Yeah, I like that 415 number. "
"1650620","1651960"," Rest in peace, poppers."
"1652360","1653980"," Good morning, kid."
"1654120","1654240"," Time. "
"1654360","1654600"," How are you?"
"1657400","1662180"," Yeah, I was wondering about if anybody had experienced with Mr. Zach Morris and all those guys."
"1667020","1669300"," It was like Hugh Henn or something or Henn."
"1670120","1670780"," Hugh or Halfner. "
"1672480","1674920"," He was all over Fintuit too, right?"
"1681400","1684340"," Someone got busted for making three cents on 50 shares."
"1684700","1685300"," Are you shitting me?"
"1686640","1687700"," Good morning, Audrey."
"1687920","1688460"," When can I wear you?"

"1702370","1703210"," We talked about this. "
"1703210","1713050"," We talked about, you know, you guys ask me sometimes to trade small float"
"1713050","1713870"," stocks, that kind of stuff."
"1713970","1714730"," I don't do any of that shit."
"1718430","1719250"," Can't do that shit. "
"1719810","1720170"," I got caught."
"1720390","1724850"," I talked last week in a stream about getting caught in a pump and dump."
"1727090","1731710"," I was in a small float stock, but it was small. "
"1731710","1737710"," And there was a guy that came in and told me that the whole thing was a pump and dump"
"1737710","1738050"," operation."
"1738790","1739730"," I had become friends with him."
"1739750","1742350"," He seemed like he knew he was talking about it over time. "
"1742490","1744650"," And eventually he was like, get out now."
"1744910","1747430"," He was like, they're going to come in here and dump all this shit."
"1747630","1748250"," I didn't believe him. "
"1748730","1749530"," I got caught in it."
"1749610","1750830"," I was fucking pissed."
"1752050","1752770"," I mean, it was cool. "
"1752930","1759050"," The guy said something to me, but I got a previous high over here, the closing high back over here."
"1760330","1761710"," There's another one right here."

"1781580","1782640"," These MAs don't look good. "
"1783040","1797210"," I don't like them on this chart, this"
"1797210","1797810"," one minute chart."
"1797810","1801850"," I always like this."

"1812910","1814350"," I won't get traction on posts."

"1817070","1822630"," I'm getting on posts have to be like, they have to be like edgy or some shit. "
"1822890","1827790"," It's really weird."

"1884260","1885240"," It should fade."
"1886700","1888800"," Any any sell off yesterday or any."
"1889180","1889520"," That's all. "
"1889760","1894220"," If the report the CPR report had to sell off, it would have it would have rebounded back up."
"1894460","1898000"," If the CPR report was a good report, it was coming right back down."
"1898680","1899420"," It wasn't going to hold. "
"1899820","1900520"," No way."
"1900680","1900960"," No how."

"1944460","1944940"," That's my bad."
"1951650","1954330"," Yeah, Joe asked me if I got rid of my hedge and I didn't. "
"1954890","1956870"," There was no way for me to get rid of it anyways."
"1958910","1962130"," Because I would have had to have gotten rid of it outside of market hours."
"1962470","1963390"," No, I couldn't. "
"1963470","1964750"," It's an option."
"1965210","1967610"," So there's not nothing to do but hold it."
"1967870","1969450"," And I don't think I would have gotten rid of it anyways. "
"1970890","1973790"," My head is built for move to four."
"1975010","1976890"," Fifteen, fourth, twenty, four, thirty."

"1992740","1994740"," So if you get if you have a shot of for net."
"1995520","1999340"," After a meal or something or before you're going out to eat or something like that, it's fine."

"2040690","2041850"," That's a big part of it, Winky. "
"2042370","2043890"," There's some big stuff in the background."
"2044590","2047310"," They want the stock price low for his compensation package."
"2048010","2049370"," So some of you guys know that. "

"2059790","2060330"," For the purchase. "
"2061330","2064429"," And in that float road loan, you know, who you know who's back at as well."
"2066790","2068389"," So there's some leverage there."
"2069730","2071510"," People will be more powerful. "

"2138920","2140000"," I want you guys to see it here."
"2141760","2142780"," It's not for a way. "
"2142820","2143220"," It's right here."
"2143280","2144080"," It's four or five."
"2144640","2145920"," It's right there. "
"2147060","2148340"," See this yellow line right here?"
"2148460","2149140"," This is the line."
"2150260","2151120"," Where the bulls."

"2153700","2154360"," Times been passing. "
"2155020","2156140"," We've been grinding higher."
"2156300","2157140"," This is really the line."
"2157340","2158620"," And then, of course, you want to get over the. "
"2161180","2162180"," No, not that."
"2162420","2162940"," Yeah, no, no, no."
"2163060","2164140"," Let me take a look now. "
"2164820","2166120"," Now you get me scratching my head here."
"2168140","2170280"," Yeah, so the bulls are maintaining the 200."
"2170880","2173320"," Going to see this 200 day moving average right here. "
"2173340","2174720"," And the bulls are maintaining right now."
"2174880","2175280"," Very bullish."
"2175880","2178440"," For the bulls, but they want to break out of this. "
"2178620","2179860"," They need to break out of this."
"2180060","2182160"," I know they say this doesn't matter, but it does."
"2182780","2183440"," This does matter. "
"2183640","2184900"," These were sellers are hiding above."
"2185800","2187240"," Bulls need to hold this with conviction."
"2187680","2188420"," Forget this red bar. "
"2188520","2189060"," It means nothing."
"2189760","2192660"," What does mean something because of this red bar above here?"
"2193280","2194420"," That's like four 10."
"2195480","2197980"," You guys want a conviction about anything above. "
"2198740","2200380"," Four 10 zero two."
"2201740","2202460"," Is huge."
"2203940","2205880"," You get some other stuff going on. "
"2206040","2207280"," You just broke above the 400."
"2208300","2209780"," That's a huge move for the bulls."
"2211920","2215120"," So for right now, being above the 200 is big. "
"2216620","2219340"," But you're going to see up here that the bears going to want."
"2219520","2221100"," I'm telling you the bears are telling you bears."
"2221640","2224660"," The bears have every set up right now. "
"2224680","2227320"," I promise you bears have every set up."
"2230000","2232620"," They have every set up working on their in their favor today."
"2234360","2235400"," Yes, you too, Liam. "
"2237200","2238140"," What's the red line?"
"2238860","2241400"," I don't know what that one is."
"2241600","2242560"," Oh, that red line down below."
"2244680","2245880"," That that's a gap hill. "
"2246160","2246600"," Oh, not a gap."
"2246780","2247780"," Yeah, that's basically a gap hill."
"2249180","2252540"," If that's the one down below you talk about insane, insane range. "
"2252560","2253400"," We can go places agreed."
"2253660","2255720"," Yeah, but they've priced into this market."
"2256440","2260440"," You can see you can see the implied volatility in the in the option pricing this morning. "

"2284290","2288070"," You're going to see video makers take vacation."
"2288310","2289970"," You're going to see Twitter get real quiet. "
"2291790","2292750"," After this weekend."
"2293450","2295410"," So we're going to have a ton of time to go over gamma stuff."
"2296430","2299150"," I'll explain gamma to you guys in depth. "
"2300630","2302290"," I can talk to you."
"2302730","2305170"," I can tell you every single last little part of it."
"2305550","2307490"," How it's derived, how zero gammas derived. "
"2307890","2308990"," I'm actually doing all the map."
"2310330","2311810"," With my daughter right now."
"2312270","2314190"," And so I'll go over all of it with you. "
"2320320","2321940"," I'll go over the equations with you."
"2323020","2325520"," Now you guys are going to get access some really cool stuff too."
"2327460","2328560"," So you can check your own. "
"2328660","2331000"," You can check for these levels every morning on your own."
"2332480","2336080"," I'm going to try to start getting it for at least the major tickers."
"2336680","2338220"," I'll try to do it for all the indexes. "
"2339200","2342720"," Every morning and I'm going to try to do a little beautiful bounce right off a VWAP here."
"2343800","2346980"," Just blasting the R1 to the pivot line."
"2350230","2350990"," Look at this. "
"2351630","2353130"," It's hard to even show this stuff right."
"2353270","2354570"," You can barely see VWAP here."
"2355750","2360310"," Just broke through the two highs from the end of the day yesterday. "
"2361450","2363190"," Now trying to make our way up to pivot."
"2364290","2365630"," That's 403 86."
"2371060","2374000"," Should I bring this over maybe for a minute so you guys can see it. "
"2374000","2378160"," Because it's kind of the range is so large that it's hard to."
"2379940","2382140"," I'll just keep these over here so you can see them."
"2382220","2387060"," You can see VWAP or VWAP is just pull on, bought the line on VWAP. "

"2414840","2416240"," He can be co-moderator with him. "
"2418320","2420440"," I know people get salty with your wife's boyfriend."

"2442340","2442560"," Dude."
"2443620","2448760"," I made a doc from the calculate zero gamma based on supplied quote tables from CBOE."
"2449160","2451420"," It fits out a nice little graphic on a local webpage. "
"2451840","2452360"," Hell yeah Matthew."
"2453500","2455000"," That's what we're working on right now."
"2456060","2456760"," It's badass. "
"2458400","2459280"," Good morning."
"2459280","2460120"," Your wife's boyfriend."

"2465460","2465980"," It's pretty cool."
"2466140","2466260"," Yep. "
"2466440","2466980"," I've been on."
"2467400","2472400"," I've been all of our GitHub as well searching for a Python code for gamma modeling."
"2476820","2480060"," The November 10th still has been retested a second winky face room. "
"2480060","2483420"," Definitely that we grind higher all day long today."
"2484340","2485000"," Cap check Tesla."
"2485260","2486160"," Tesla's down right now. "
"2486180","2486860"," We'll talk about Tesla."
"2488820","2491180"," You want to be seeing there's a couple of things."
"2491260","2494280"," What tests we need to know is they have a put wall 150. "
"2495520","2498080"," If they get cascading waterfall puts."
"2498920","2500440"," On top of those."
"2501380","2502660"," From an institution. "
"2504340","2506460"," We need to talk about that with a gamma two."
"2507780","2511540"," Dealers are like the dealer percentages like eight to 10% of the market."
"2511980","2514680"," And you have real money buying real money selling that takes place. "
"2514680","2518740"," And where it doesn't matter if the dealers try to try to."
"2520680","2521240"," Delta."
"2522280","2523260"," Delta hedge. "
"2523940","2527040"," Those puts they don't the market makers don't want."
"2527940","2528080"," To."
"2529980","2535080"," They don't mind coming close to printing those puts, but they need another round of put buyers to"
"2535080","2536780"," come in in panic and fair. "
"2537040","2540160"," So that would be the place where you see Tesla dump."
"2540160","2542940"," From one fifty down to one thirty six."
"2543200","2545220"," You need to see real money selling from institutions. "
"2546680","2548560"," And that can either overtake."
"2549680","2551060"," The options influence."
"2553340","2556940"," Or you need to see waterfall put buyers protection buyers. "
"2557900","2562900"," In a capitulation moment you'll see that sometimes when margin calls take place there."
"2563500","2564980"," Come along only hedge fund."
"2564980","2570740"," I have rules that force me to hedge at the worst possible times. "
"2571760","2574500"," And that can create a cascade effect as well in a stock."
"2575020","2578680"," So if you see that in Tesla we can look at Tesla if you want here in a moment in"
"2578680","2579660"," the moment I'm going to assume."
"2580440","2587660"," That there's some sort of a trigger for long only hedge fund or not hedge fund like portfolio"
"2587660","2588140"," managers. "
"2589540","2593620"," That are forced nice little ping right here on on four thirty six."
"2594160","2597660"," Let two pennies wham slammed right into it."
"2598720","2599880"," On the pivot point. "

"2645790","2646730"," He has a hue hen."
"2648090","2650030"," What's thoughts and prayers level for Tesla please."
"2650030","2651590"," We can go have a chance of thoughts and prayers. "
"2654790","2656470"," There's no really like thoughts and prayers."
"2656830","2657770"," It's more about."
"2660600","2661920"," It's it's more about. "
"2663300","2665500"," Let me bring up tests real quick here."
"2671840","2674300"," So what I live streamed with you on Monday right."
"2674540","2675600"," What did I say to you on Monday. "
"2677200","2679740"," I put this here for you on Monday and I told you right."
"2679880","2681520"," I said this is very bearish right."
"2681520","2682800"," Right this move right here. "
"2683420","2686580"," Told you I said this was over over bearish."
"2687840","2689800"," And what happened yesterday right."
"2690020","2690600"," Came right up. "
"2691300","2693280"," To pivot slammed right off it."
"2694380","2695880"," So you should have already known this."
"2696860","2698860"," Haven't changed this chart at all. "
"2699780","2702060"," And on Monday told you how over bearish this was."
"2704340","2706980"," Now broken through S3 from two days ago."
"2707280","2709660"," I haven't read charted this today yet. "
"2709660","2713780"," I did release the levels for you and I showed you this."
"2714420","2716160"," This by point down here right."
"2716360","2717080"," I told you why. "
"2717880","2719780"," I can show you why again if you want."
"2720160","2722120"," Now there is something to be said for."
"2723560","2725940"," There's some kind of a put wall down here okay. "
"2728840","2731380"," There can be capitulation down here."
"2732280","2732800"," If it triggers."
"2733560","2736020"," This would trigger like waterfall hedging. "
"2736460","2739080"," So it's usually called considered the worst possible time."
"2740460","2741260"," For hedging."
"2742120","2745160"," And what they would do is they would pay out the puts at one fifty right. "
"2745700","2749000"," Slam down real quick pay those out and then slam back higher."
"2749780","2751980"," And that's down lower at one thirty six."
"2752280","2753380"," We can look at that if you want. "
"2754140","2754700"," It's right here."
"2758780","2760400"," Right right here one thirty six."
"2761800","2764260"," So you have that quick capitulation moment down here. "
"2764980","2765740"," You would see."
"2767580","2768820"," Come right down here."
"2769780","2774340"," And what would happen this could happen today right with the fed rate decision doesn't go towards"
"2774340","2774620"," tech. "
"2775160","2776780"," It's slam down you trigger."
"2778840","2780660"," Protection trade basically."
"2781340","2784640"," And what would happen would be you start to see the initial impact. "
"2785540","2786760"," Of that trade made."
"2787440","2791960"," You'd see the monetization of this of all the puts that are down here."
"2793420","2797160"," And then you would see these long only hedge funds get trapped in those puts. "
"2797920","2799200"," We move higher right here."
"2799900","2802240"," I don't know if you guys understand the concept."
"2803240","2804980"," Are these concepts of how this happens. "
"2806040","2807540"," Does that mean that happens today?"
"2807880","2808440"," I don't know."
"2810460","2814520"," Initially the expectation would be that at some point down here the dealers are going to want to"
"2814520","2815180"," print this."
"2817980","2820940"," And you've got a double bottom forming currently at the moment. "
"2822600","2823640"," On a two day chart."
"2824860","2825600"," On Tesla."
"2826860","2829080"," But this is how stuff like this gets set up. "
"2829080","2830140"," If you're a bank."
"2831240","2833160"," That wants to buy cheaper down here."
"2835280","2840040"," You break through this one fifty and the assumption would be that this would trigger that. "
"2840740","2843960"," That's how you get these capitulation moments where it's like you blast down briefly."
"2844960","2846660"," And you trap all these people we've seen this."
"2847040","2848980"," I don't know if we've seen this this year but. "
"2848980","2853060"," In previous years I've seen this exact."
"2854280","2854700"," Thing happen."
"2855340","2856760"," And then two or three days later. "
"2857320","2861840"," You'll actually hear that companies are heads are funds long only funds."
"2862560","2863840"," Got caught in this."
"2868240","2872640"," So that's that your tail risk right now for or I would say for. "
"2873980","2875820"," If you're if you're a Tesla bull."
"2876540","2879460"," Your tail risk is just somewhere down here one thirty six."
"2882020","2885740"," I think it can blast lower than that would depend upon a whole bunch of other stuff. "
"2888560","2894600"," The bulls have something coming for or the bulls want to see unemployment grow."
"2895520","2896900"," I think you might see that tomorrow."
"2898180","2903060"," If you start to see unemployment move up as inflation is coming down. "
"2903540","2906080"," There should be a point where we find bottom in the market."
"2907240","2909040"," I don't think we've seen bottom."
"2909040","2910320"," I shouldn't even say that. "
"2910760","2914860"," It's the only indicator that will show you the true bottom for the next bull run."
"2916660","2919280"," As when unemployment really starts coming coming up higher."
"2920140","2922620"," I don't know why no one talks. "
"2922840","2925500"," I think people don't talk about that because it can turn off followers."
"2926200","2927480"," They can turn people off to."
"2928420","2931320"," To say that you want to see blood in the main streets. "
"2933460","2935400"," I was just be conscious of this down here."
"2935460","2936720"," If you're a Tesla trader."
"2938000","2939620"," You're looking for something like this. "
"2939740","2940460"," You're looking for like."
"2941560","2943040"," I don't know if it's today or tomorrow."
"2943040","2944960"," You're looking for some kind of move down here. "
"2945480","2945840"," Bam."
"2946340","2946960"," You trigger it."
"2947200","2948500"," It just blasts down. "
"2949100","2950480"," You're waiting to buy this down here."
"2950980","2952700"," Do you get great economic news today?"
"2954300","2956080"," Or a great decision move."
"2956380","2958800"," Great decision news that is supportive of tech. "
"2959760","2962200"," You're looking for like one fifty one fifty five."
"2962200","2966020"," Anything in here to be buying later this afternoon."
"2971180","2972740"," Now let's talk about ahead. "
"2973040","2974740"," I was DM this morning by somebody."
"2975580","2978590"," And they said something to me this morning that was important."
"2980320","2982500"," I didn't have a chance to reply to them. "
"2982520","2983880"," And I'm not going to mention who they are."
"2984660","2985820"," By name or anything."
"2988350","2990290"," To get the fed funds rate announcement to two. "
"2991810","2993550"," And then we've got this is where they're all."
"2993690","2995710"," If we have a good fed funds rate announcement."
"2996130","2997110"," You guys know at two thirty. "
"2997470","2998450"," What happens right."
"2999710","3001850"," Two thirties always the usually the nasty."
"3002210","3005970"," The nasty part of the day if there is good news and bad news. "
"3011970","3013650"," We'll talk about that this morning as well."
"3014190","3016630"," But be aware of this if you're a Tesla bull."
"3019710","3022610"," I'm a buyer like full buyer at nine ninety. "
"3024770","3025710"," Right down here."
"3027330","3030510"," About a hundred and thirteen to ninety two dollars."

"3036310","3038130"," Look at this beautiful by here."
"3038390","3039790"," Big giant green bar."
"3040590","3042010"," One hour chart beautiful. "
"3043090","3043590"," Cranking."
"3046480","3047620"," You want to see where."
"3048180","3050920"," You want to see that four ten is above there right. "
"3056030","3057670"," This is insane looking at this."
"3061350","3064230"," If bulls can get up here and hold above this right."
"3065310","3067790"," You'll be looking was this this is a little. "
"3069230","3070070"," Nastiness here."
"3070470","3072750"," This is constructive for bulls to be going up."
"3073270","3074370"," Catching this for a way. "
"3074990","3078450"," Sometimes when there's anticipation of a good report from the."
"3079290","3079930"," From the fed."
"3080370","3081330"," Some kind of a."
"3082050","3082570"," Dovish. "
"3082930","3085010"," You'll see us trade this up all day long."
"3086070","3087090"," On fed days."
"3087510","3090890"," Sometimes people say it's a bearish on the fed days but it usually isn't. "
"3092270","3093410"," Someone's trading this higher."
"3095710","3097890"," Love huge buyers coming in right now."
"3113760","3115860"," Move our one over here so you can see it. "

"3158430","3159990"," They all were all over. "
"3159990","3160530"," Fint to it."
"3161090","3161950"," Yeah, they were all over."
"3162110","3162410"," Fint to it. "
"3163210","3163650"," It was."
"3163790","3166150"," I know I got a letter in the mail if it is that everybody on class."
"3166250","3166790"," Action suit. "
"3167310","3168450"," That's the part about the scams."
"3168510","3169070"," The meme sucks."
"3169590","3172970"," That creates a lot of fun with regular people and you start believing that you have to participate"
"3172970","3173730"," in the stuff that could be. "
"3174230","3175610"," Yeah, week is making a good statement."
"3176070","3176290"," I was."
"3179930","3181730"," I was pretty angry last week. "
"3182570","3186370"," As a matter of fact, I have to make a somewhat of an apology to somebody out there because I"
"3186370","3186630"," was."
"3186930","3188050"," I was going on a Twitter rant."
"3189990","3192090"," I was like two or three weeks ago when. "
"3193070","3195270"," Brookstone or whatever when Jay Powell had a speech."
"3195290","3196730"," I said, look, in the next."
"3197650","3198870"," Weeks, you're going to see. "
"3199530","3202030"," Growth stock pumpers come out like crazy."
"3203770","3208650"," And then I tweeted that on Twitter and was going on a rant and somehow Twitter algos picked that up"
"3208650","3210130"," and started putting in my feed."
"3211430","3213150"," Growth stock pumpers and. "
"3214450","3217630"," Some of those posts were growth stock pumpers and some of them weren't."
"3218830","3220190"," And I ended up."
"3221350","3226610"," Like retweeting a bunch of these tweets and some of them were, you know, some bad guys. "
"3227650","3229490"," And one wasn't."
"3231830","3236030"," And he he messaged me and asked me why I had."
"3236610","3238190"," Made such a nasty tweet. "
"3239270","3244730"," And I don't normally delete tweets, but that though that tweet those tweets I had made I'd gone"
"3244730","3245370"," back and deleted."
"3245370","3247670"," Because I felt like it was unbecoming of me."
"3248790","3250550"," I was really nasty and I shouldn't have been. "
"3252070","3253050"," And so I was deleted."
"3253250","3255190"," I had been, I had already deleted it and."
"3258130","3259490"," He was like, what's up?"
"3259610","3263430"," And so I was talking to him and I was like, look, it was a journal up in it. "
"3263490","3267190"," And I was like, I was like, I didn't know it was you that I did, but I had tweeted"
"3267190","3267530"," that."
"3268950","3269990"," And I felt bad."
"3269990","3274870"," I was going to make a public post about it, apologize to him. "
"3275930","3277810"," And I haven't done that yet, but I'm going to do that."
"3278670","3282050"," I just need to make a craft post that's not that looks good or whatever."
"3282450","3284570"," I explained to him how angry I was. "
"3286870","3290290"," With pop stock pumpers and I was angry about."
"3293350","3299070"," New trainers getting trapped in that shit and you know, when you're in a bull run, it's very easy."
"3300430","3306410"," In a bull run to think you're a great investor and a great trader, especially if you come into the"
"3306410","3308730"," market for the first time as a bull, let's say. "
"3309470","3312270"," And you get swept up and being a bull."
"3314030","3314770"," I'll say this."
"3314810","3317630"," If you come into the market and you're a bear, you get murdered. "
"3319090","3319910"," In a bull run."
"3320370","3324490"," If you come into the market as a bull in a bull run, you think you're the best investor and"
"3324490","3326270"," trader that God's ever seen, right?"
"3327950","3333530"," And then the moment that the market turns for any length of time, like this environment, the year,"
"3333850","3334210"," two years."
"3336550","3337610"," You get destroyed. "
"3338550","3338890"," You get."
"3339210","3344130"," So there's this thing where like, do you make a bad train to bull run?"
"3345530","3349030"," It's going to it's going to print if you just hold diamond hand, right?"
"3350990","3355550"," But when the when the liquidity drives up in the market, even when we go up."
"3356450","3362530"," In this kind of a market, if you're a bull, you have to be very tactical, you have to be"
"3362530","3363170"," spot on. "
"3363490","3367530"," If you can make it through this environment as a bull, bull runs are a cakewalk."
"3368450","3374690"," But so many investors and traders come into this environment from a bull run and they can't adapt"
"3374690","3377350"," to this environment as a bull."
"3379090","3383950"," If you make it out of this environment into a bull run, it's it's it's it's glaring. "
"3384470","3393650"," How good of a trader you become in those bull runs because of how tactically you have to be in"
"3393650","3394930"," this down market as a bull."
"3395630","3397090"," There's no room for error."
"3398730","3405950"," You get penalized the moment you make a mistake in this market as a bull, right?"
"3407090","3412030"," I've never had more trading rules than in a market like this ever. "
"3413410","3416050"," There's there's there's no room for error."
"3416090","3422090"," There's not a lot of money to go around for you as a retail trader as a bull in this"
"3422090","3422430"," market."
"3422550","3426910"," As a matter of fact, I know I talked to bears outside of Twitter. "
"3427910","3435050"," I have friends that are bears and you know, not public, but we talk and it hasn't been easy for"
"3435050","3435670"," bears either."
"3435670","3441610"," This this market has been brutal for most retail traders and even the statistics out there show the"
"3441610","3445990"," same thing that you might think that bears are doing well in the smart market is gnarly."
"3446590","3449950"," There's just not a lot of money in this market. "
"3458040","3460360"," Saw those big giant balls up there, right?"
"3461140","3462680"," They're just buying this right now."
"3473390","3474750"," Just smashing and bashing."
"3480920","3482800"," So this person called me and asked me a question. "
"3482960","3486060"," When do you how long did it take for you to start making consistent money?"
"3486540","3487960"," That's not an easy question to answer."
"3488280","3492560"," I've lost money all through my career of lost money."
"3492840","3499860"," So I don't say to you about that, but I can definitely say to you that if you're losing money,"
"3499860","3503300"," today's event is probably not for you. "
"3505120","3509460"," Whenever we have these events, I'm always I try to impress upon people that."
"3509840","3514420"," And I know that you can take both sides of the trade and know he can buy, you know, fire"
"3514420","3518480"," out OTM puts and calls chase one side, cut the other side loose."
"3519380","3521280"," But for some young young trader out there. "
"3522120","3523180"," Events like this."
"3523500","3525300"," I'll tell you what, I cannot tell you."
"3526040","3529920"," If you if you speak to a pro, right, they usually sit out today. "
"3530960","3532100"," And they trade."

"3542020","3545300"," You've got you're talking about an event today that's going to decide."
"3547640","3552040"," Basically the rest of next year, you know, to some extent, it's going to tell us where we're"
"3552040","3552260"," headed."
"3553080","3558680"," And there's there's so much time to trade the reaction off this for you not to lose all of your"
"3558680","3558940"," money. "
"3559720","3560780"," So I'm going to say that to you."
"3560840","3564400"," If you're listening right now, if you contact me on Twitter this morning, I'm going to let you know"
"3564400","3566080"," that days like today."
"3567560","3568540"," It's so much. "

"3577540","3579020"," It's just a cash machine."
"3579920","3583740"," And so when these events happen, you just don't have to trade them. "
"3583840","3586440"," There's just no requirement to trade these."
"3587100","3587540"," It's better."
"3587700","3589560"," Always better to trade the reaction off this stuff. "
"3596070","3597670"," Spies respect the dark pool."
"3598310","3598930"," That's what you guys are saying."
"3603480","3603940"," Yeah. "

"3632080","3632860"," Why not trade yet?"
"3634420","3636100"," You were going to ask you why not trade yet."
"3636200","3637680"," I'm going to explain it to you real simple."

"3699880","3703340"," And then we're up here and you're asking me to take calls here."
"3703440","3705140"," I'm like, I don't know, man."
"3705700","3708440"," I'd rather just let them decide where we're going and trade that afterwards. "
"3709940","3711620"," I'd rather take all of this in here."
"3713320","3716860"," And then so you know, if you're looking at just right here, right, this whole move right here."
"3717980","3720240"," I'd rather take the meat of this trade right here. "
"3722160","3727160"," And I'd rather leave the, you know, the crazies down here and the crazies up here, right?"
"3729960","3732680"," You know, this is the meat of the trade right here."
"3732700","3733800"," This is where you make your money."
"3734720","3736700"," So you can trade lotto's up here. "
"3736940","3737560"," Does that make sense?"
"3738620","3740360"," So you can do lotto's up here."
"3740940","3741280"," How about this?"
"3741460","3742800"," If you made money this whole run up here."
"3743800","3745240"," Throw a couple grand down. "
"3745880","3747720"," Throw five grand, throw 10 grand down."
"3748420","3749460"," All the power to you."
"3749500","3751680"," You can trade this trade, trade away. "
"3756100","3757120"," You deserve it."
"3757460","3758740"," That's how I feel about it."
"3759780","3764160"," I love, I love trading zero dates on on fed, on fed days. "
"3765740","3766420"," Love it."
"3768460","3772240"," But if anyone's asking me like, what are my thoughts on it?"
"3772940","3775000"," Or should you be doing it or anything like that?"
"3775100","3776580"," I think they're way better days to trade."
"3780290","3781930"," Easy setups, most days. "
"3783570","3784310"," No risk."
"3786410","3788650"," You have risk of hundred point swings today."
"3789390","3791430"," And tomorrow, I think it's today and tomorrow. "
"3792310","3793810"," I think it's when the vol starts to kick off."
"3794690","3797230"," Or we start to lose some vol tomorrow."
"3799130","3800070"," Where things get easy. "
"3800390","3801010"," It's like easy street."
"3801810","3802390"," Almost free money."
"3802590","3804390"," Don't, I don't care if we go up or down. "
"3805510","3807710"," It'll likely be easier, much easier money."
"3810760","3814760"," We'll talk to a volatility wizard about that as well because you can actually look at."
"3816280","3820460"," You can actually look down the line and the implied volatility should be looking to see if more"
"3820460","3821340"," puts are purchased. "
"3822780","3825620"," After today's event, you'll know if we're going to roll the market over or not."
"3825840","3826280"," It's pretty easy."
"3826400","3829280"," Not easy, but you can see into the future a little bit. "
"3833140","3835060"," See if we're going to get a Santa rally or not."
"3841400","3842640"," Just a second here."
"3842700","3856070"," I want to see if I can get this"
"3856070","3856950"," on here for you. "
"3866480","3869320"," Rodrigo Khan saying big money, load and calls, 25 coming."
"3870140","3870980"," Good morning, Guru."
"3871260","3871540"," How are you?"
"3873060","3874940"," Even though it's going up still too risky. "
"3875200","3876020"," I don't think it's too risky."
"3876180","3876820"," I think that it's."
"3878100","3880900"," I think I'll be trading today, right?"
"3881100","3882840"," I'm going to trade the event today. "
"3882840","3890720"," But at the same time, when I look at, when I'm looking at different timeframes and you're going to"
"3890720","3896460"," go full account on a Fed Day, it just seems there's just no need."
"3898000","3900080"," Just just no need to."
"3909450","3910430"," These guys are funny. "
"3911550","3913310"," I always try to find out who's."
"3916130","3916670"," Do I fight?"
"3916770","3917130"," Yeah, I trade."
"3917130","3918030"," I trade retracements. "
"3922190","3923230"," Why are we all here today?"
"3926730","3928610"," For DJN trades is why we're here today."
"3930890","3932930"," That's why we're here in Mr. Unrealized Province."
"3944120","3951980"," You guys, you know, I'm telling you, you got you got zero dates up here, right?"
"3952140","3953980"," They're outside the money for two dollars. "
"3954600","3957440"," That'll be worth like 30 cents in a blink"
"3959590","3977700"," of an"
"3977700","3977700"," eye."
"3977700","3979320"," I'm just trying to come in and roll this over right now."
"3979480","3986090"," Now 404.32. You guys are hilarious. "
"3986470","3987290"," I always love you guys."
"3987650","3994990"," I love all of you waiting for Captain to get."
"3995350","3996310"," Get somewhere you dirty. "
"3996670","3997090"," Yeah, I know."
"3997490","3998730"," They're trying to roll it right now."
"3998750","4008850"," You can see the red balls on book map starting to"
"4008850","4009630"," see a little bit of weakness. "
"4017080","4018720"," Trying to send it right back over here."
"4020600","4022040"," Look for the speedwhap down below."
"4022180","4028660"," It's about 403.13. See if the bulls can hold on here and try to tag a higher high. "
"4033440","4034460"," You know, I think."
"4042660","4046180"," There's no back to normal, but they need to create backholders above, I suppose."
"4048780","4049820"," You know, there's like this. "
"4052580","4058880"," From my perspective, I think I've posted this before what if you if you look at the charts that I"
"4058880","4060760"," show you if they trade this market sideways."
"4062820","4071920"," And down into 2024, the risk of doing serious damage to companies and"
"4071920","4073360"," our economy."
"4075720","4081480"," So you get to look this from the perspective of the Fed is you have economics, right?"
"4082000","4083460"," I heard someone say this yesterday. "
"4084900","4087880"," You have the idea of what are equal."
"4088120","4089400"," We have like economics, right?"
"4089580","4091080"," A degree yet and."
"4092340","4095819"," Economic theory, then you have like the cult. "
"4096880","4100340"," Of who controls our economics in the United States."
"4100340","4101939"," You get the Fed treasury."
"4103800","4104600"," Politicians. "
"4105040","4106319"," You get corporations."
"4107760","4112840"," And modern monetary theory, a modern monetary theory right now."
"4114439","4116880"," Trying to push and pull the lovers. "
"4116880","4120439"," You've got you've got currency markets that are hidden from."
"4121100","4122560"," Your your sites, right?"
"4122779","4124399"," You've got mass manipulation."
"4128080","4129040"," So there's. "
"4129140","4135120"," If you look at the market and if we that if we trade it sideways and down for another year."
"4136359","4138140"," Waiting for unemployment to come up."
"4138620","4143160"," The longer we trade it sideways and down, we're going to end up going down to those levels. "
"4143160","4146380"," You're looking for 2,400, 1,600, 1,400."
"4147140","4150100"," And I think the Fed knows this."
"4150279","4151359"," I think the Rome knows this. "
"4151979","4152939"," The Guillain knows this."
"4153939","4154920"," We did this before."
"4156080","4159200"," In 2000, we did it before in 2007. "
"4160960","4163740"," You know if we slip underneath the weekly moving average."
"4164960","4170140"," If we start trading sideways and down into that weekly moving average, we slip underneath it."
"4171960","4175819"," Then at that point we're just waiting for real damage to be done. "
"4177359","4180640"," So can you blame them for thinking well, you know, we'll do that."
"4180840","4181859"," We'll trade it up."
"4182760","4186279"," And we'll just hammer it back down again until unemployment rises. "
"4187620","4190819"," So the damage is down to 3,500 or 3,100."
"4191560","4194880"," They want to see a bottom around 3,100 probably."
"4196340","4201620"," They don't want to see us like trade down to 3,100 trade sideways for another year. "
"4202380","4206940"," And then get it down to, you know, the 1,400s, the 1,600s, the 2,400s."
"4207020","4207580"," They don't want to see that."
"4208000","4208780"," I can promise you that. "
"4208860","4209420"," They don't want to see that."
"4213380","4216180"," So I don't know if that's the only way for us to get unemployment higher."
"4216740","4217680"," There's this whole rationale. "
"4217740","4224620"," If you look at the back, going back into the 60s and 70s, actually pre that, right, they used to"
"4224620","4229300"," use inflation to keep high employment rates."
"4229300","4237640"," And they switched to easing monetary policy."
"4237880","4244560"," But then you have the Volcker moment, where Volcker raised rates and made the market believe that"
"4244560","4245060"," he was serious. "
"4247140","4250320"," And the markets went up even though they cranked rates, right?"
"4250500","4252380"," They just kept cranking rates and cranking rates."
"4253400","4255080"," So they believed Volcker."
"4255640","4257080"," They cranked rates. "
"4259300","4260460"," And the market believed."
"4261480","4263000"," And the market actually went up."
"4263720","4267420"," But what was going on underneath was the unemployment rate was rising. "
"4268720","4271220"," And then we had that rollover capitulation moments."
"4272400","4278460"," They eased back on rates at the same time."
"4278460","4280580"," And then we had that capitulation moment market crashed. "
"4281140","4283320"," But the crash wasn't as brutal, right, as it could be."
"4285300","4293460"," So there is this argument that the Fed, and this ties into the Fed is going to pivot at some"
"4293460","4296400"," points and become more dovish."
"4296540","4298140"," I think you get 50 basis points today. "
"4298280","4299660"," I think you get the 50 basis points."
"4300460","4301940"," People have disagreed with me on this."
"4302160","4306700"," I think if they did 75 basis points, this market has a real chance to go up. "
"4306840","4314640"," I know that people disagree with that, but I think Goldman Sachs had, that gives it a 30% chance"
"4314640","4318320"," of a 75 basis point rate hike today."
"4318800","4320500"," I think that's the dark horse in the room."
"4322340","4327940"," If you can trick the market into thinking that they're taking inflation. "
"4328120","4330340"," Well, we already know inflation is going to crash this year."
"4330520","4335800"," That puts them into needing to pivot historically, but they haven't gotten unemployment up yet."
"4337400","4343080"," So if the market can take them seriously and they can keep cranking rates, you might see"
"4343080","4347400"," unemployment rise and you might see the market go up. "
"4347540","4348940"," There's a real chance of that happening."
"4349600","4351520"," We've seen instances of that in the past."
"4357600","4360720"," I think 50 basis points, I think 50 is on the table. "
"4364210","4365470"," I don't know what they're going to do."
"4365570","4368050"," The longer that they wait with this, we're not easing shit."
"4372800","4375120"," So anyways, John of Joe to leptin. "
"4376680","4380400"," If you ever catch them out there in the wild or whatever, go check them out."
"4380600","4386640"," I shouldn't have been such a shit mood that night, but I was so pissed."
"4387240","4392900"," Not at him, but at all the fucking stock pumpers, man, that shit bothers me. "
"4393320","4394780"," I've been caught in that shit in the past."
"4400210","4403930"," A little bit of a break here, bear stepping in right now, trying to throw it down lower."
"4408620","4410340"," Some distribution coming in right now. "
"4418420","4419920"," Yeah, we've already done the chart."
"4420140","4423940"," We've already, I've already shown you guys, I've already shown you, or you guys want to see them"
"4423940","4425060"," again, like the Fed funds rate."
"4425260","4426180"," You guys want to see that stuff?"
"4426980","4428580"," You guys interested in that stuff today?"
"4428760","4434520"," I thought I did this on video last week, went through the Fed's fund rate, inflation data,"
"4434880","4435580"," unemployment data. "
"4440320","4442100"," We can go through it again this morning if you want."
"4461940","4464060"," Yeah, I'm bullish here."
"4466080","4470380"," My overall view point is that we roll it over no matter what, into January or March. "
"4470940","4473960"," We're going to retest that weekly moving average, I promise you."
"4474560","4477780"," I don't care how bullish, I don't care if we're bullish today or bearish."
"4478600","4479040"," We're retesting. "
"4480160","4483540"," You're going to see the weekly moving average get retested for move higher."
"4485680","4488220"," There's a high probability of that happening."
"4497580","4500560"," I'll put a poll out right now, find out what you guys think. "
"4501400","4504440"," I'll put a poll out, give me a second here and I'll do a poll."
"4506320","4508040"," Find out what you think is going to happen."
"4509180","4515040"," If you're just joining us for the first time, feel free to subscribe and join the chat. "

"4524870","4525870"," people in here."
"4527330","4528410"," With time and market. "
"4536800","4542060"," Just a moment here, I'm going to launch a poll for you to answer."
"4557860","4562440"," I'll ask you in this poll, let me see here."
"4563680","4566520"," I'm not going to ask you about the terminal rate and what you think they think. "
"4566520","4572140"," I was wondering that today, if they could do what the reaction would be on a higher terminal rate,"
"4572140","4573340"," raised in the terminal rate."
"4575000","4588380"," I'm going to ask you about what will the rates will"
"4588380","4589120"," be announced today."
"4596420","4597040"," Let's see. "
"4603100","4605820"," I'll give you 50 BPS."
"4605820","4606000"," Yes."
"4608620","4610120"," See what your thoughts are out there. "
"4610380","4611660"," 75 BPS."
"4614960","4615780"," Hold on here."
"4623550","4625430"," Do they shock the markets today?"
"4640350","4641610"," I'm just going to leave a set. "
"4641790","4644910"," So I got 50 BPS, 75 BPS, 25 BPS."
"4644910","4645090"," Yes."
"4648010","4649250"," And then announce a pause. "
"4649510","4651650"," I'll give you another one with announce a pause of some kind."
"4657660","4660880"," And that could include a 25 BPS or no rate increases."
"4663220","4665440"," And I'm not going to ask about terminal rate right now. "
"4665800","4666140"," Let me see."
"4667820","4672180"," You got this post that to you right now."
"4672620","4673760"," You guys want to answer that. "
"4676640","4681820"," Yeah, you too, but ask me if I want to if I want to insert ads in this, I'm like,"
"4681980","4683000"," no, I don't want to insert ads."
"4693220","4703200"," You know, I truly believe that I truly believe if I would love the"
"4703200","4706540"," 75 BPS, I'll be as a bull I would."
"4708260","4714460"," As a bull, I'm looking for 75, I want to see 75 BPS. "
"4717840","4720160"," And I'd like to see a shock."
"4725380","4729160"," Go down, slam down on the weekly moving average."
"4729760","4731140"," I would love to see it. "
"4731920","4735940"," And then in a note, the Fed comes out, Jay Paul comes out as a presser and says some kind"
"4735940","4736320"," of nonsense."
"4736480","4742220"," They're going to reverse course, see a spike in unemployment, see corporations saying they're going"
"4742220","4742860"," to lay off everybody."
"4744020","4745820"," Try to jumpstart it for a little while. "
"4750180","4753340"," Everyone has faith in Jay, the Fed."
"4755600","4757560"," Some kind of a jumpstart like that."
"4761490","4762970"," I think that's their only chance. "
"4770060","4770700"," No way."
"4770780","4771140"," No way."
"4771260","4774220"," They'll shock the market into the holidays that would trigger a purge nationwide. "
"4775180","4776240"," That's their only choice."
"4776280","4778180"," They really are backed into a corner."
"4779340","4781140"," I think the Fed can see that. "
"4782460","4786380"," I think the Fed can think the Fed can see that they're backed into a corner."
"4789780","4795340"," So you either shock with something like that or shock with a pause or a 25 BPS."
"4797240","4799760"," My gut instinct is telling me that. "
"4800660","4804820"," If they stand the course today, right, if they stand the course 50 BPS."
"4806060","4807360"," Unchange terminal rate."
"4809420","4810440"," What is he is?"
"4810540","4814800"," Is he thinking in the background when I just keep backing myself in a corner. "
"4815520","4817800"," Back myself in a corner into springtime."
"4819860","4820920"," It's going to get nasty."
"4824580","4827080"," You're going to see unemployment just just plunge. "
"4828340","4829640"," The longer that they wait."
"4831640","4833540"," They're going to think that they're over tightening."
"4836800","4840980"," CME is given a 18% chance of 75 BPS. "
"4841400","4842480"," That's still high, isn't it?"
"4843160","4844440"," Well, here comes the bulls."
"4845080","4846900"," Let me get the red pedal right here."
"4847620","4849080"," Bull's wanting blood right now. "
"4851730","4853330"," Bull's hucking it over right now."
"4857130","4858790"," VWAP right here at 403."
"4864030","4865670"," Watching this right now is hilarious. "
"4868070","4870150"," Get a bear share for a minute."
"4870690","4871590"," Can I say bulls?"
"4871590","4872670"," A minute bears."
"4875270","4878410"," We got 67 votes and will there be an arraignment announcement?"
"4878710","4882170"," Let's check out what they're saying here. "
"4884970","4892020"," Let's see what the poll says for the respondents saying to the poll."
"4894520","4896360"," What rates will be announced today?"
"4896720","4898500"," 50 BPS is the consensus."
"4900500","4902020"," That does make sense to me. "
"4903640","4904720"," 50 BPS."
"4905500","4910340"," Only 19% think there'll be a 75 BPS rate shock."
"4910520","4912960"," That's in line with what the CME is saying, right?"
"4914220","4914900"," 19%. "
"4915500","4917700"," Announce the pause, 7%."
"4918500","4919600"," I'm shocked at that."
"4920620","4922500"," 25 BPS, 0%. "
"4924340","4926640"," Nobody thinks 25 BPS."
"4927120","4928340"," That would be a shock too, right?"
"4930540","4932820"," Lower rate hike, 25 BPS."
"4932820","4940440"," The last question I'd be posing to would be if they stay the course with 50 BPS, once we get"
"4940440","4947080"," into the presser side of things, that's where it always gets interesting, right?"
"4952650","4954850"," CME yesterday said 75 was 26%. "
"4960810","4964190"," There are a ton of 190 calls this week all of a sudden."
"4969840","4970780"," Yeah, you know what?"
"4970840","4978800"," There's this thing about how to dealer's hedge, indexes versus stock."
"4980340","4983860"," They do it differently in stocks versus indexes. "
"4986420","4991340"," The term rate was 4.5. 0.25 BPS rockets to 430 in two minutes."
"4993440","4998560"," To be incredibly bearish causing the signals things are breaking a lot faster than the Fed thinks."
"4998820","5006200"," Yeah, I think the 25 BPS is as much of a shock as the 75 BPS. "
"5006340","5006920"," Only it matters."
"5008840","5010120"," I think there's a shock there."
"5013670","5016250"," The terminal rate is the real question, right?"
"5017670","5018630"," It is. "
"5020350","5028630"," I think that I think that bulls don't realize that I think that the market participants aren't old"
"5028630","5035190"," enough to remember that the market can go up with rates being ratcheted up."
"5035870","5044710"," There's a market narrative right now to trade the market down and I hear this narrative all the"
"5044710","5046830"," time that the market's doing the work of the Fed."
"5048630","5050570"," I find that hilarious argument. "
"5052970","5060150"," If that's the case, then the market has the potential of going up with ratcheting right now."
"5064620","5069140"," The most important thing in my opinion is if PayPal brings up wage pressure inflation is going"
"5069140","5069420"," down."
"5069600","5072520"," So the only thing that keeps the Fed put on the gas is wage pressure. "
"5075060","5077760"," Pain trade is fitting to 4,000 here for next two weeks."
"5080240","5082820"," Oh, so MS is thinking we get the 25 BPS."
"5083080","5084460"," I think that would be a shock too as well. "
"5087940","5090640"," I like the idea of the Fed staying the course at minimum."
"5092420","5093500"," Just staying the course."
"5095980","5097280"," I like the idea of it. "
"5098980","5100760"," You need to get unemployment up."
"5100900","5101660"," Unemployment's a problem."
"5108990","5112190"," Nonstop Tesla puts is every hedging with Tesla. "
"5112270","5113730"," What's Tesla doing right now?"
"5118790","5119690"," Still bleeding?"
"5124100","5125200"," Yeah, it's still bleeding."
"5131400","5133200"," There's no real volume spike here."
"5143170","5145930"," We have 7 million men sitting at home playing video games. "
"5146470","5159270"," Yeah, I"
"5159270","5160410"," like the idea of a Tesla."
"5162070","5164230"," He's in a corner."
"5164430","5165290"," He's backed into a corner. "
"5166370","5167530"," He really is."
"5175130","5176730"," Stock market is the ultimate video game."
"5178830","5179430"," That's true. "
"5179990","5180850"," I'll have a second here."
"5189250","5191870"," Books kind of even right now on order flow."
"5193250","5196410"," They're just trying to jump in right now and throw this back down to VWAP for trade. "
"5198430","5200150"," If you missed all this is a bull."
"5200330","5203910"," You probably want to be trading VWAP here a little bit of a curl and VWAP right now."
"5206750","5208510"," See if we can get a trade going in here. "
"5214380","5216380"," Maybe I'll take a trade with you guys."
"5223540","5224820"," Just one green down here."
"5225360","5226060"," Something like that. "
"5232200","5233560"," See if the bulls can hold on."
"5261450","5263090"," To be irresponsible Powell."
"5263410","5264270"," I don't know if it's a response. "
"5264270","5265650"," I think Powell needs to."
"5265950","5269710"," I think he's stuck in this place where he has to either jumpstart it."
"5270330","5276170"," Where we plunge down to the depths of hell bounce off the weekly moving average and go higher. "
"5277450","5282130"," I think that's his only chance and then sell the market down once unemployment rises."
"5282950","5284670"," And you don't get the depths of hell."
"5284890","5288010"," I think if he tries to he he's on this leash where. "
"5288850","5293670"," If he trades this market sideways and down into twenty twenty four and we'll make attempts."
"5294530","5298690"," In January March we'll make an attempt at the end of the year point twenty four."
"5300070","5304430"," And we're going to be looking for TLT trade right if that happens. "
"5305630","5310430"," We'll look for that TLT trade to go up and we'll look for HYG junk bonds to go down."
"5312950","5317770"," We were talking about a documentary that some college kids made the other day."
"5319390","5325590"," Here's a like a bootstrap tech recession going on where these these college graduate tech work"
"5325590","5325870"," tech. "
"5326670","5332970"," Our computer science degree kids are talking about not going to work for big tech companies."
"5335370","5340630"," Striking out on their own that the pipeline is disappearing into those companies you'd send out"
"5340630","5341150"," your resume."
"5342350","5347050"," Package to a hundred of the top companies and you get a job somewhere that was easy. "
"5347050","5351230"," I guess all these kids are afraid now they all want to go off in their own."
"5352350","5356570"," That there's going to be some kind of a big tech recession coming up in the next year."
"5359890","5366110"," I always like to hear hear what the kids are saying out there sometimes more so than the adults. "
"5367270","5369090"," If they can if they can see it coming."
"5371880","5375140"," That's that sideways trade that's that fifty BPS trade."
"5383110","5384630"," That sideways and down. "
"5385190","5387070"," Bears don't want to give it up though do that."
"5387190","5388750"," They want that bear market for another year."
"5388990","5390430"," They want that bear market and that plunge. "
"5391190","5392270"," No matter what."
"5400590","5404310"," What do we have above there's that four or four or five four or five."
"5404450","5405250"," What much four or five. "
"5406110","5410030"," They're so expensive three dollars three dollars for zero dates."
"5422170","5424830"," Three thousand dollar trades right here for a ten pack."
"5444470","5448290"," Look at I'm looking at this trade right now and I'm like this is the same. "
"5452670","5454250"," Let's see what's higher over here."
"5454330","5454890"," We break through."
"5466820","5468320"," Same above four ten. "
"5470140","5471780"," You can see the supply above."
"5481500","5483420"," Be I want you to be mostly thirsty."
"5484600","5486360"," I want to let you all know today that. "
"5489360","5491080"," Be careful in these ball trades."
"5493080","5498500"," The moment the events over your your your three dollar calls are going to go to be reprised I"
"5498500","5499020"," promise you."
"5500680","5505960"," The market can be going so you you'll take the money off. "
"5506520","5511080"," Once the ball is what once we lose all the mark and re enter the call side or re enter"
"5511080","5512740"," the put side of that trade you're taking."
"5513300","5521120"," I'm watching some calls right here."
"5538360","5539700"," Looking for four ten. "
"5554220","5569590"," Some resistance"
"5569590","5570350"," right here."
"5573580","5576300"," Got a block of sellers here and a in above."
"5609110","5610910"," There's another block somewhere up in here. "
"5630250","5645640"," Yeah, I've got a I'm in a"
"5645640","5646420"," trade right now."
"5650160","5652300"," I'm close to being stopped out of it right now too."
"5696220","5697480"," Just taking him into trade. "
"5703830","5705670"," It's not a lot to be made on this right now."
"5706590","5708270"," Like trading pennies here."
"5717380","5718860"," Risking thousands for dollars. "
"5736880","5737780"," Come on baby."
"5741640","5742680"," Come on you dirty dog."
"5743980","5745200"," Let me get stopped out here. "
"5745280","5745600"," I know it."
"5765120","5768740"," I entered somewhere in here when I get stopped out here in just a minute."
"5793180","5794820"," More buyers and sellers right now. "
"5821710","5823010"," Keep on grinding baby."
"5836090","5837470"," So I'm going to take a look back here."
"5840240","5840920"," Give me a second here. "
"5841140","5842240"," I'm going to look at some."
"5843060","5847160"," Where they were selling off yesterday."
"5865780","5867220"," 405 79. "
"5877730","5879590"," Here's 405 right here."
"5885630","5887550"," Last little push up baby."
"5887990","5888350"," Get up there. "
"5894750","5897350"," Watching some bots come in right now on the put side."
"5910020","5911600"," Keep doing that rip."
"5926820","5928840"," Just raising some stops now. "
"5929900","5932020"," Come on 405 C's."
"5955160","5956190"," Tag 404 51."
"5959100","5960440"," Come on push baby. "
"5968040","5970360"," I'm like a penny away from getting stopped out of 304."
"5973180","5974600"," They keep bouncing around."
"5975660","5976180"," I'm out. "
"5976580","5976980"," That was it."
"5997810","6000250"," That was like a 15 cent trade on $3."
"6000710","6001170"," That's absurd. "
"6014400","6015240"," Yeah, I'll show you guys."
"6015400","6016480"," You guys want to see some hope?"
"6017280","6017820"," Give me a second here."
"6017840","6019240"," I'll get you guys some stuff here. "
"6044620","6045480"," Let me just take it."
"6045540","6047760"," I'll show you some some returns on Fed days."
"6103880","6104760"," All right. "
"6110830","6113450"," I've got a stocks have sold off on Fed Day lately."
"6113970","6115530"," There's some interesting things in here."
"6115710","6117970"," So this is the day of right. "
"6119110","6121510"," You can open this up on your own charts."
"6121930","6124150"," You guys want to look at this on your own charts here."
"6124930","6126490"," But you'll see on. "
"6127310","6129010"," There's some interesting places here."
"6129150","6130330"," Like so back here in March."
"6130990","6135170"," We were on the I think on the March 16th, right?"
"6135290","6138270"," You can take a snapshot of this on March 16th, right?"
"6138990","6141310"," We were agreeing to two point two percent. "
"6141510","6144930"," Then we were one point two percent the following day, but we were already at the bottom of the"
"6144930","6146570"," channel coming back up."
"6147330","6152090"," So we stayed on trend is the key point take away on the 16th."
"6152670","6155450"," Same thing on the 27th of July. "
"6156870","6159530"," We were agreeing the first day and the second day."
"6163470","6165050"," There's no real correlation here, right?"
"6165270","6166990"," You got 75 PPS here."
"6167150","6170410"," We had a 1.5 percent day and then 3.3 down the next day. "
"6170670","6175730"," But if you look if you snap lines on your charts, we were already in trend to go up on"
"6175730","6179090"," July 27th and the same on the 16th."
"6179090","6182830"," And then you can see these other days here."
"6183010","6184290"," We had negative days, right?"
"6184510","6194270"," 2.5 percent than 1.1 percent, 1.7 to 0.8. The key takeaway here is that four out"
"6194270","6196550"," of six times we had red. "
"6197490","6200290"," Either better positioning higher to take the red trade."
"6201450","6206010"," We just started selling off at some point the first day and the second day."
"6206010","6208850"," But you guys can snap this and take a look on the chart. "
"6209230","6212390"," We tend to stay in trend or stay in trend."
"6214010","6220110"," Where we are is my point behind this on Fed rate decision days."
"6225910","6231230"," Just pause the video, go back and take a snapshot of that, download it, snap some lines in the"
"6231230","6236230"," chart so that you can see what happened after these Fed rate announcements. "
"6236230","6242690"," So you get people that'll be out there telling you like 75 BPS will do that 50 BPS will do"
"6242690","6242910"," that."
"6243590","6248110"," The truth is most of the year we stayed right in a downtrend."
"6248310","6253290"," If we were in the bottom of a downtrend or a rate decision, we were still heading up anyways. "
"6253510","6254690"," We're already in oversold conditions."
"6255430","6256170"," We traded higher."
"6261300","6264940"," We'll take a look at some other I'll say some other stuff here. "
"6277800","6283460"," In 60 seconds, Bloomberg's reporting this morning about the 60 seconds before the CPI had heavy"
"6283460","6285660"," trading drove the mystery rally."
"6289040","6290800"," What else are we looking at here?"
"6297810","6299010"," The mystery rally."
"6299290","6299650"," I love it. "
"6302010","6304030"," It's tough killing me when I see this stuff."
"6305330","6307910"," We'll take a look at some second."
"6311830","6313010"," I get some stuff I bring up for you. "
"6320720","6321840"," Let's clean this up."
"6378160","6380380"," I'm glad I got stopped out of the trade now."
"6380460","6381500"," It's rolling over a little bit. "
"6391850","6393030"," Give me one second here."
"6393130","6395230"," I don't have to get in touch with Ball Wiz real quick."
"6395990","6401330"," I'm going to take a quick 15 minute break and just give him a shout out real quick. "
"6405510","6407490"," I'm going to actually do something here."
"6407590","6409310"," I'm going to switch over to another screen real quick."
"6417350","6418190"," Let me just second here. "
"6439980","6442660"," Give me just five minute or just give me like four or five minutes."
"6442680","6443200"," I'm going to send."
"6443500","6445460"," I got to send a link out to Ball Wiz. "
"6445640","6448560"," Make sure he's all set up for what he needs to come on the stream."
"6673430","6675530"," Coming into a new low and Tesla right now."
"6989060","6990160"," Just be careful in here. "
"6990280","6991660"," You're seeing a little bit of a rug pull go on."
"6991720","6994480"," You can see that yellow bar on book map."
"6995780","6997500"," I'm trying to make sure they don't throw this over here. "
"7002910","7008710"," Like this green bar here is slowly turning into some very light light."
"7010870","7012010"," Just be careful in here."
"7014470","7016690"," The view up sits down below 40299. "
"7027670","7029490"," Do not want this breaking here."
"7030490","7032850"," No buy order is down below this block here."
"7036810","7037850"," 4075 right in here. "
"7037990","7039730"," There should be some buyers stepping in here."
"7041170","7041910"," There's not should be."
"7042030","7042230"," There are. "
"7042390","7045310"," If you look on the on the order book on the right hand side of the book map right there."
"7045310","7046070"," There are buyers here."
"7046130","7046950"," But this breaks right here. "
"7047050","7047550"," There's nothing below."
"7432480","7433320"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7433340","7435140"," You just have to follow what the ball is. "
"7436160","7437240"," Just go to follow them."
"7437480","7438680"," He's going to be here at 130."
"7439100","7442020"," Want to make sure we have enough time or just the right amount of time to talk. "
"7442920","7443860"," Before the presser."
"7445580","7449260"," We're just chatting about his thoughts on the market today."
"7449660","7450140"," Very interesting. "
"7451620","7455420"," So we'll see how that plays out into the rate decision."
"7457260","7460400"," Very interesting take to I like this take."
"7460980","7464820"," I'm not going to say anything about what his take is. "
"7464820","7467360"," It's not going to really impact right now what's going on in the market."
"7468080","7473600"," I think it's going to be early enough for for you to listen to what he has to say about"
"7473600","7473780"," it."
"7477400","7482000"," So one 30 this afternoon you have always in the house was just talking to Joe. "
"7482120","7483080"," Joe don't it out there."
"7483400","7484720"," I was going to bring him on."
"7484720","7488440"," And he's he's waxing poetically right now, but. "
"7489020","7492060"," He doesn't know if he wants to go on and wax poetically with everybody."
"7492900","7494420"," I love listening to him talk."
"7503690","7505350"," Well, here we go right now. "
"7505830","7507510"," We're going to see a move here in just a moment."
"7508310","7509630"," We're going to have a break here."
"7517370","7520530"," Yeah, if you don't already follow him, his name is at volatility was. "
"7521930","7526130"," V-O-L-A-T-I-L-I-T-Y whiz."
"7526650","7527750"," He's a part of that."

"8974780","8975340"," It's insane."
"8975660","8976480"," I'm watching it right now. "
"8976580","8978940"," I'm on the, on the, on the options chain."
"8979120","8979780"," I think it's insane."
"8981320","8982520"," I think it's insane. "
"8988460","8989780"," They're absolutely insane."
"9004020","9005680"," Trying to catch the leg right here."
"9006840","9008880"," I think they'll, it's a little bit lower. "
"9009640","9011140"," Leave this like right here now."
"9011540","9012040"," They're trying."
"9013080","9015100"," Trying to turn this into some support here. "
"9015280","9016120"," Trying to turn this green."
"9017860","9019020"," See if they can do it."
"9019720","9021240"," We'll give them the benefit of the doubt right now. "
"9023240","9024620"," I'll give them the benefit of the doubt."
"9024760","9026940"," We're far, we're way far off on VWAP down here."
"9027460","9028600"," Just waiting to drop it. "
"9029500","9029940"," Yeah."
"9030100","9031940"," It's always like these days where you're like."
"9033480","9034100"," Yeah, man. "
"9034240","9035020"," We're going up, baby."
"9035140","9035620"," It's awesome."
"9035760","9038320"," And then what do they do right before the event?"
"9038320","9039540"," They just slam it down. "
"9040140","9041540"," You're caught holding your balls."
"9041540","9046940"," Not always, but you know, it's like stuff like this where I'm like, I have no business in this"
"9046940","9047220"," stuff."
"9048540","9049340"," No business. "
"9049340","9051820"," I want to get trapped by anybody."
"9058270","9060350"," 404 98 coming to the top of this key."
"9060450","9061550"," We showed you just a few minutes ago. "
"9075870","9076350"," Yeah."
"9076450","9082770"," So for me, I'm usually buying oversold, selling overbought and then, you know, you look for the"
"9082770","9085170"," retracement for a pump off 68 or whatever."
"9085310","9089370"," And then maybe you trade that like super oversold. "
"9089870","9093430"," That's where my most of my trades come in there for the money make."
"9093430","9094870"," And then the DJN trades."
"9095990","9100650"," Yeah, you want to be buying, I want to buy in zero dates at pennies, not pennies, but you know,"
"9100810","9103010"," 20, 30 cents, 33 cents. "
"9104070","9105190"," You know, nice 30 delta."
"9105490","9107630"," It's just, you know, just what just blood bath in it."
"9107630","9108310"," Grab some calls. "
"9108310","9109650"," Grab some puts on the other side."
"9111150","9113750"," And I like, I like some arbitrage stuff into the clothes."
"9114990","9116330"," Not as much as I used to. "
"9116430","9119230"," I used to like to hold stuff a lot of stuff overnight, but I don't like hedging in the overnight."
"9120590","9123130"," It's not, it's not as conducive as it used to be."
"9123210","9126310"," Again, we have, you know, not a lot of money in the market right now. "
"9126850","9129490"," So most of those trades have gone away."
"9141160","9144360"," Whenever I see stuff like this with zero dates, I'm like, no way."
"9154860","9155300"," Yeah. "
"9155420","9157600"," So you're going to get classes for me coming up."
"9157780","9160720"," See the one cool part is you're going to see the market get real quiet."
"9161820","9163240"," After this weekend, right?"
"9163240","9165260"," So next week we'll start doing classes. "
"9165660","9168480"," You'll get emails from me on class."
"9168600","9171540"," I'm going to start releasing classes all open to public, all free."
"9172240","9172820"," Nothing behind a pay. "
"9172940","9174220"," Well, you guys aren't getting on that for me."
"9175980","9178360"," So you'll start getting them coming up the next couple of weeks."
"9178380","9180560"," You'll start seeing, you'll start seeing me post them. "
"9181320","9184480"," And then we're going to do a couple of zoom calls or private live streams."
"9185520","9186780"," If you haven't signed up yet, sign up."
"9187540","9188260"," Captainjimjames.com."
"9189560","9190180"," We've got it. "
"9190360","9192240"," We don't send you emails every week."
"9193240","9197660"," You don't get any like bullshit or like emails from me trying to sell you some shit."
"9199880","9202520"," We'll do some, some unlisted classes. "
"9203400","9208260"," 100, 200 people in a room and we'll go over how, like, how do I make my money?"
"9210220","9212720"," And safely how to place trades, safe trades."
"9217740","9224660"," And then I'm starting to, I was talking to Joe about the day and I was like, I have to"
"9224660","9225720"," start at square one."
"9228900","9230100"," Like, what is a share?"
"9231920","9232920"," What is a stock?"
"9236420","9237920"," What's a publicly traded company?"
"9239800","9242580"," It makes short videos and splice them all together. "
"9243300","9244080"," So we'll go through all that."
"9244280","9247320"," And then you can just click through whatever you want and then we'll lead right up to."
"9250000","9251380"," Don't go chasing scams. "
"9253260","9258460"," If you're trading DJN trades, it should be like the cream off of what you're making in this market."
"9258980","9260380"," Don't ever complicate your trading."
"9260720","9261620"," Be a dumb trader. "
"9262720","9263160"," Separate."
"9263440","9264660"," I mean, there's so many things."
"9269560","9275340"," Yeah, if you sign up, if you sign up, uh, it's a free sign up. "
"9275480","9276900"," There's no paywall and none of that shit."
"9276900","9279060"," And I just sign up."
"9279060","9280880"," I'll send you an email and let you know when we're doing that stuff. "
"9280960","9281460"," It should be coming there."
"9281700","9284480"," You should see me doing that stuff in the next couple of weeks because it's going to get nice and"
"9284480","9284740"," slow."
"9285360","9286560"," Nice, easy time to do it. "
"9289020","9290440"," All this ball will kick off."
"9290520","9291200"," It should kick off."
"9291380","9294200"," I mean, I don't know if you're a bull or a bear out there. "
"9297660","9301320"," At least the implied ball coming up is a little bit lower heading into."
"9302880","9305300"," Currently it's heading into."
"9306900","9309020"," The end of the year looks quiet. "
"9309360","9310940"," We've had years where it hasn't been quiet."
"9311580","9313680"," We've had, we've had at least a few."
"9314340","9315920"," We've shown you what those years. "
"9316900","9319360"," Uh, where we haven't had quite right where."
"9320180","9321060"," They have sold."
"9324800","9326200"," Push above, push above. "
"9327700","9329080"," Push here, push here."
"9331800","9333240"," Next level is down here."
"9335800","9336940"," Way down here. "
"9337840","9339300"," It's a little bit down in here."
"9339460","9340600"," I guess you could extend this lower."
"9341440","9342740"," You could say this is really here. "
"9344480","9346380"," The truth is it's down here."
"9350300","9351380"," Even then it's small."
"9357560","9359640"," I don't know if this would hold up though if you start selling. "
"9377760","9378180"," I don't know if this would hold up."
"9378180","9379080"," This is all I'm waiting for."
"9379300","9380980"," I'll tell you exactly what I'm waiting for. "
"9381060","9383620"," I think I posted this in the weekly brief."
"9384700","9388660"," I'm just looking for all of you to get trapped up here so you can sell me your expensive calls"
"9388660","9391200"," for dirt cheap and capitulation moments."
"9392580","9393760"," You get three dollar calls. "
"9394020","9395220"," I'll buy them from you for 30 cents."
"9396800","9397680"," You'll get petrol."
"9397840","9398960"," I hope this is your subsets. "
"9399080","9400180"," I'm such a cheap."
"9400380","9401400"," I'm such a cheap fuck."
"9403000","9405620"," I want to buy your three dollar calls for like 30 cents. "
"9406900","9412960"," And then run it up to like $2.97 or $2.70. You'll be crying."
"9414840","9416540"," It'll never come back to $3."
"9419660","9420700"," That's what I want to do. "
"9423840","9425560"," My day off yesterday was recovery."
"9428660","9432020"," On Monday night, Monday night, I was like, oh, I'm going to bed."
"9432160","9432600"," Everything's fine. "
"9434560","9437100"," And I had some old friends that were like, let's start drinking."
"9438480","9439520"," So I started drinking."
"9441200","9445960"," And then when I woke up, I woke up on Tuesday morning and I'm about to get the live stream"
"9445960","9446260"," started. "
"9446520","9448720"," And I'm like, I'm just hungover."
"9448840","9449180"," I'm fine."
"9449720","9450760"," And then I'm like, I'm not fine. "
"9452770","9454610"," I'm like, I can't be on a live stream."
"9455950","9456690"," No way."
"9457770","9458570"," No way. "
"9460190","9464210"," I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a, like you know, you have"
"9464210","9471890"," a, you have a, when you start dating a girl or something, you have a, you have a stunt cock"
"9471890","9472630"," for yourself."
"9473710","9475450"," Like some girl trying to meet her or something."
"9475630","9476590"," You push a friend on her. "
"9477170","9482450"," I need a, I need a, I need a stunt double for live streaming."
"9482450","9486210"," When I, when I've, when I've gone out, gone off with friends and partied all night long."
"9492020","9492740"," Oh, yeah. "
"9492920","9493460"," I could have come on."
"9493580","9494500"," I'm like, I'm not coming on."
"9495540","9500560"," Even my wife was even like, my wife was like, uh, uh, said she'd even like run a stream where"
"9500560","9504620"," I'm not here, but you can have the book map up and the levels up and all that kind of"
"9504620","9504880"," stuff. "
"9505780","9509640"," You know, I got to teach her how to do that stuff that ever happens again, but."
"9510860","9514520"," Which of course, it was the holidays, you know, you get friends that show up everywhere and they're"
"9514520","9516440"," like, Hey, buddy, what's going on?"
"9516560","9517260"," I haven't seen you in a year."
"9517280","9519400"," Let's party since the holidays. "
"9519440","9520220"," What it is."
"9521240","9522940"," Oh, there's the bloodbath right there."
"9522960","9524420"," Bear's coming in, showing that. "
"9525720","9527440"," Nice liquidity break in the spy."
"9530900","9532640"," Just blood it down right now."
"9534060","9537020"," There's been waiting all day long to get that, that, that roll, man. "
"9537180","9538080"," They're just up here waiting."
"9538840","9540040"," They can smell it."
"9545720","9547820"," And so I'm like, I'm not going on there. "
"9548000","9549360"," I'm like, I'm not doing this."
"9549360","9550260"," I'm like, no way."
"9553200","9554300"," Just trapping them. "
"9554380","9554640"," Look at it."
"9555000","9555440"," Terrible."
"9557380","9559160"," Nice little quick red bar in here. "
"9563520","9564780"," Big old red ball."
"9568520","9570580"," Just stopping out longs in here."
"9577440","9579780"," Yeah, so that's what it was on Tuesday morning. "
"9579920","9580920"," I'm just like, I'm not doing this."
"9581300","9582680"," Well, I had a bit of a weekend too."
"9582820","9584020"," I saw this past weekend. "
"9585040","9588720"," I have to work on a bunch of more like behind the scenes."
"9588720","9594320"," I'm doing a bunch of work on an algorithm predictive algorithm."
"9596580","9598580"," And then I'm working with my daughter. "
"9599540","9605980"," She wants to be in finance and she wants to get a math degree or a finance degree accessible data"
"9605980","9609220"," for retail traders on some kind of a website."
"9610440","9614220"," It's free and you're not paying fees to people to get that information."
"9616220","9617800"," And to grow that into something. "
"9618940","9622480"," There's there's this guy that he, what he did was he designed a website."
"9623280","9628680"," That will do your taxes for you and you just input your stuff and tells you we're going to pay"
"9628680","9630580"," for tax like some just tax stuff."
"9632340","9633760"," People have access to that. "
"9633840","9635960"," They'd normally pay the company to do for them."
"9636100","9637760"," I was like, if you do something like this."
"9638580","9645680"," And you go down the rabbit holes of black schools, all this kind of stuff that always like. "
"9647540","9651560"," What is what are the Greeks first, third, second, third order Greeks?"
"9651980","9652560"," What do they mean?"
"9655080","9658600"," So we're going down all these rabbit holes right now with my daughter and."
"9659960","9663280"," So, you know, she's in school all day long and then I'm live streaming."
"9663480","9665260"," I need to eat dinner and sit with them. "
"9665260","9668720"," And then, of course, Mike, let's sit down for a few hours at night time."
"9669360","9670680"," So not a lot of time, of course."
"9670860","9674700"," And then, of course, I have friend come around being like, you know, let's start. "
"9674880","9675920"," Let's drink some for that bronco."
"9676020","9677960"," Let's finish the night with a bottle of for that bronco."
"9678380","9679140"," And I'm like, what?"
"9679760","9680580"," Of course, I'm doing it. "
"9681160","9682900"," A little bit of blood right now here in the market."
"9685480","9687160"," Trying to catch that reversal, right?"
"9687440","9687880"," See that, right?"
"9688140","9689400"," Trying to catch that reversal here."
"9690400","9692780"," Start building it and take it down to the next level over here. "
"9693580","9695220"," These bears coming out, right?"
"9697620","9699620"," The bears looking for that setup, right?"
"9700300","9703080"," Break this consolidation down a little bit."
"9703540","9704260"," Send it down."
"9704820","9706260"," Come back up for a nice fat rejection. "
"9707640","9710180"," Get through this level and back down a VWAP over here."
"9711260","9712620"," See if the bears can do it."
"9713520","9715640"," I'll have to switch to the color red for the bears. "
"9716820","9718800"," See if they can get that bloodbath rolling."
"9719300","9720860"," I'll trap some of these bulls in."
"9721600","9724160"," The bulls think they're getting a free ride into the end of the day. "
"9725840","9728160"," I'm trying to get underneath these moving averages here."
"9730100","9733820"," Trying to trap men, trying to get some bulls, trying to buy up in here."
"9734480","9736080"," Start sending it down a little bit, right?"
"9737000","9739460"," Come through some of this volatility, slap it down in here. "
"9741360","9743000"," Get back to the start of the day."
"9745120","9747320"," Take these bulls right back over here."
"9747860","9749180"," Bottom of the key over here. "
"9749640","9750600"," See that key up there?"
"9751160","9753000"," These bears want it so bad they can taste it."
"9753860","9754400"," See that?"
"9754580","9755920"," They're like, nah, nah, nah, brother."
"9756940","9757720"," He ain't going up. "
"9757860","9758680"," They were coming down here."
"9759400","9760920"," Come back down here is what we're doing."
"9762080","9764700"," The bears are all hot and sweaty, getting all lubed up. "
"9766940","9770860"," The bulls thinking they're going to be buying this down here and taking it to the top of the key"
"9770860","9771680"," like a slam dunk."
"9777340","9779440"," Take a look at a five minute chart again real quick."
"9779620","9783440"," Just give you guys some reference here. "
"9786470","9788330"," See this big old bear flag up here."
"9788410","9790810"," Bears like, yes, I say yes."
"9790990","9793030"," They're like, this is full rejection up here. "
"9793650","9795310"," You have 120 point move up here."
"9796070","9798250"," And you don't think you stop somebody out above here?"
"9799990","9802750"," You don't think that there was someone got hurt up here."
"9803350","9808490"," I know they're saying like bulls got hurt up here, but someone had some stops up here. "
"9808870","9809150"," Big money."
"9810470","9812670"," 120 point move up guaranteed."
"9814110","9815910"," Guaranteed's a big player got hurt up here. "
"9817470","9820130"," Triggered some stops and we just started selling."
"9820690","9821310"," This is a big move."
"9822110","9824070"," It's a huge move up there. "
"9825130","9826990"," You're going to trigger some cells."
"9828870","9830130"," Four, 14, 10."
"9831990","9832470"," Right. "
"9832670","9835190"," Anyway, people buying dips over here yesterday probably."
"9835530","9841010"," Well, I'm away for one day and you guys are probably all just loading up, loading up, loading up on"
"9841010","9842690"," four twenties, four fifteens."
"9843110","9851670"," I looked at the CBOE data last night and you should have seen the volume of calls that came in"
"9851670","9851950"," up here. "
"9853310","9854690"," So you got bulls in here."
"9854810","9856930"," They're just trying to just trying to make some money back, right?"
"9857870","9859770"," Trying to unfuck themselves today."
"9861290","9862870"," Meanwhile, you get the bears over here. "
"9863430","9863950"," Where's Lego?"
"9864170","9864690"," Hell no cap."
"9864950","9867650"," We're just waiting for them to come up here so we can sell it down on them."
"9868310","9869930"," It's an inter-day trading cap. "
"9870590","9871370"," It's all it is cap."
"9872970","9875230"," It's bringing right back in here for the decision."
"9879940","9881800"," See all that nastiness up there. "
"9882820","9884880"," You want to get some implied moves for the day."
"9885080","9886480"," Some implied moves for the day."
"9888540","9890460"," Or at least how the market's priced. "
"9892820","9894160"," It's a big one right here."
"9894700","9895580"," So that first move."
"9897040","9898900"," I'm looking for a first move today. "
"9899960","9901340"," The upper down doesn't matter."
"9901860","9903260"," We'll be looking at targets somewhere in here."
"9903420","9910120"," If you get a big, bad decision for the bulls, something that's perceived by the market even on a"
"9911020","9912960"," smaller time frame, initial time frame. "
"9913580","9914940"," This is a time in here too."
"9915040","9916440"," You make it this nice push up higher."
"9917160","9918440"," We'll talk about the push lower too. "
"9919140","9920740"," Because the implied move is actually down."
"9921900","9923700"," There are not some big gap down here."
"9924560","9926360"," We can talk about that if you're in a position. "
"9928460","9930060"," It's actually down farther down."
"9930220","9932360"," It's like down here, believe it or not."
"9934520","9936140"," If you trade this today, right?"
"9938180","9948060"," The thing you want to know is the closer you are in the money, the better off you are"
"9948060","9950840"," because you might get like your initial move down or up. "
"9951800","9953800"," You might not actually get here or here."
"9956070","9958970"," You're going to find some resistance up here in this initial move up."
"9961430","9964190"," And they need to be repriced twice today. "
"9965450","9966410"," They'll reprice."
"9969710","9970510"," First on."
"9973030","9974070"," Hold on a second here. "
"9974210","9975910"," We want to draw one more in here."
"9976730","9978490"," Get a little gap to fill down below here."
"9988720","9992680"," Let's say you got yourself some 403Ps, right?"
"9994240","10000500"," I'm going to buy these way outside the money puts down here at 392 or something. "
"10001400","10005020"," You might see a blast off and just a miss before you get there."
"10005700","10006160"," Makes sense."
"10006440","10008480"," Then you'll get the rest of it will come down here. "
"10011680","10013260"," Same thing on the upside here."
"10013820","10015960"," You've got sellers ready to sell above."
"10019440","10022160"," So that initial move, if you have an initial move up here. "
"10023480","10027820"," You want to take profit and reposition for a bounce right to go higher."
"10028040","10028520"," Does that make sense?"
"10029220","10032080"," And you guys have been with some of this."
"10032300","10035800"," Some of you guys are in here with me have been with me through these events and how we trade"
"10035800","10036880"," them as we go up or down. "
"10037600","10042080"," And you know that you want to be like one reprising."
"10042360","10044280"," There's a secondary pricing after the presser."
"10045860","10049880"," And you want to make sure that you're tactical in trading these levels. "
"10051380","10053660"," And you're not so far out."
"10053740","10058160"," Sometimes you'll be out of the money and it won't go up high enough for you to actually capture"
"10058160","10058980"," that trade."
"10059660","10062960"," On too far outside of the money call and then they come back down. "
"10063360","10064540"," They actually burn your calls."
"10065740","10067320"," You can't even you just have to buy new ones."
"10068960","10071160"," You cut them loose and then and buy some more. "
"10072080","10073900"," Just be careful as we trade this today."
"10075340","10078860"," Here's a Christmas colors for all your holiday rally bulls."
"10080080","10081660"," Starting to trade lower now. "
"10081920","10082760"," Testing lower lows."
"10084820","10085860"," Lower lows."
"10087200","10090980"," Bears trying to come underneath over here underneath these moving averages. "
"10092180","10095460"," Get underneath moving average one two traps and bulls."
"10096000","10096560"," Start heading lower."
"10097040","10099840"," A big part of this move is right here. "
"10106530","10107830"," Oh yeah baby."
"10108610","10109470"," Pick on the bears."
"10117900","10118700"," Bull sand. "
"10119600","10120100"," Fuck no."
"10120100","10129840"," Look for a place for the for the truly there's a gap down below"
"10129840","10130200"," here."
"10133810","10136690"," The gap down here right off the bell. "
"10139910","10142330"," It's probably the smart money is is down here."
"10173010","10182360"," You can write smart money down here to that down there."
"10183500","10185460"," So smart money is down here. "
"10187140","10189660"," Smart money is looking for a trade to pick this back up."
"10213400","10217280"," Some levels down here some previous lows will throw those in there for you."
"10226360","10227740"," We'll look back if you want. "
"10228140","10232860"," I mean you start you start seeing slam down here slam down here."
"10236140","10242670"," Give the bears some stuff to look at and see it right down here."
"10242770","10250280"," This is to see that support down in here. "
"10250380","10253300"," You don't want to see this break to your initial move would come down."
"10254260","10256960"," Right last through blast through blast through."
"10259080","10260820"," This would be like the presser hopefully. "
"10261660","10266100"," You break this right here and it's we're going down 3850 3820."
"10267860","10269380"," You can see this right here."
"10277400","10278980"," Being aware where we are. "
"10279480","10295090"," I don't know"
"10295090","10297750"," what the fuck this thing is right is like an artifact inside the screen."
"10297770","10300070"," I don't know why it's it's hard of acting today."
"10346790","10348170"," So right down there. "
"10372620","10374040"," Switch over real quick."
"10403530","10408410"," You can see for 1250 has got big cell orders way up high."
"10416920","10418140"," That's actually not that high. "
"10418360","10424820"," There's you know what I'll get."
"10424980","10426620"," I'm going to give Bull something here today."
"10441080","10450520"," I'm going to give Bull's take that he said something to me about this earlier too. "
"10452820","10455000"," I'm going to give Bull some kind of credit here."
"10455740","10458740"," There was a lot of sellers taken out yesterday."
"10460000","10462800"," Above there's not a lot stopping. "
"10464040","10468100"," Like the resistance that we had higher yesterday that was smashed for the hammer."
"10468980","10470600"," A lot of that looks like it's gone today."
"10475350","10477090"," That's interesting to see right here. "
"10487550","10491010"," At least on the at least on the on the book it doesn't look like there's much."
"10492250","10493650"," Or many sellers above."
"10496670","10497730"," That can change. "
"10501790","10503990"," But that's interesting to see right there."
"10518120","10522440"," It's not that many sellers way up high if we if we were if we were to squeeze higher."
"10523960","10525880"," I don't think there's much stopping. "
"10529260","10530880"," Stopping a pretty big rip so."
"10538910","10541150"," That's that's that's interesting to see."
"10542190","10545330"," You guys seeing that above on your end on the book. "
"10546570","10550610"," In the order book is not much there's not much stopping us going up today."
"10556230","10557410"," Yeah, I canceled."
"10557650","10558810"," I was impacting my bias. "
"10559550","10560410"," I wasn't happy at all."
"10566110","10570390"," I canceled a spot gamma because I felt as though they were."
"10571110","10572370"," They were missing market. "
"10575630","10580670"," They were missing market turns and then they weren't getting back to you close enough to say hey."
"10581670","10582550"," Markets turned."
"10582950","10585010"," I'm like oh man, I can't have any of that. "
"10585450","10588250"," I was using some big big money on trades that way."
"10591530","10595750"," If they if it's a spot camera spot camera could be kick ass if they just."
"10597230","10600930"," I had a way to get in touch with their followers and. "
"10607130","10608650"," If they had a way to."
"10614190","10616310"," And there's no because I think spot camera is awesome."
"10616570","10617290"," I think they're great. "
"10617670","10618450"," Maybe they have changed."
"10618690","10621530"," I don't know."
"10621530","10627830"," If you want to wait for them to say hey look the markets rolling over the markets being picked up"
"10627830","10629610"," and I always felt like these crucial moments. "
"10631530","10632630"," For me, it wasn't working."
"10633050","10635110"," My work for you was working for me."
"10652220","10653160"," Yeah, full pivot. "
"10653500","10654760"," So you know, they're being backed into a corner."
"10654960","10655700"," They're going to have to."
"10655780","10658160"," There's this whole thing where they have to pivot at some point. "
"10659020","10662440"," So the longer they don't pivot, the more it'll become even a bigger shock."
"10663660","10665500"," So it's like there's this whole argument about."
"10667100","10668140"," Do they full pivot?"
"10668600","10669660"," Do they rate shot?"
"10669920","10671880"," Well, then it opens the next question. "
"10672040","10677020"," If they're going to shock by full pivot, why not just slam us with 75 basis points."
"10677960","10679840"," Both will have a shock to the system."
"10683240","10686360"," Yeah, we've got volatility with the shown up here 130. "
"10687120","10688860"," He's going to go through the market with us."
"10689360","10690320"," Mark it with us."
"10690380","10691500"," He's going to hold our hands. "
"10692260","10693780"," This is a big volatility event."
"10693780","10696260"," It's not the biggest, but it's big for us for the year."
"10696640","10698880"," We're pretty much deciding direction of the market. "
"10699380","10700080"," For at least."
"10702000","10705880"," For at least, you know, a quarter, but December."
"10706860","10709320"," This is a yearly opex as well, right?"
"10709900","10711200"," December is a yearly opex. "
"10712120","10716360"," We're trying to get some direction for the rest of 2024, believe it or not in December."
"10716360","10718060"," And that leads into Friday."
"10719860","10723580"," So this whole week is this is like the main event, usually for the year. "
"10728760","10730700"," Yearly opics, opics coming up."
"10731040","10732720"," We've got quarterly opics coming up."
"10734720","10737060"," You've got massive data coming up tomorrow. "
"10737820","10739780"," We're going to fed rate decision today."
"10748340","10748720"," Thanks."
"10748980","10749540"," I appreciate it. "
"10761150","10765050"," On the on the back end of this, I've gone through it in other live streams."
"10765050","10769590"," The explanation behind why they're backed into a corner, why the Fed is lying to you."
"10770410","10774590"," Now what the Fed's real role is in all this stuff in previous live streams. "
"10774850","10777710"," Some of you guys have heard it at nauseam at this point."
"10777790","10778970"," I'm not going to go through it today with you."
"10778990","10785810"," I'm going to bring in an expert with you on this being a specific volatility driven event and what"
"10785810","10786810"," it means for you. "
"10788070","10788770"," Positioning wise."
"10806420","10809980"," And then people will say that they're not going to they're not going to shock us today, but they've"
"10809980","10810980"," done that to us before."
"10811740","10813900"," The Fed is famous for shocking. "
"10821060","10822660"," These bears coming in here, right?"
"10823360","10824780"," Nice little send it down."
"10825120","10826200"," Send it down one more time."
"10826200","10827720"," Get underneath the moving averages. "
"10828660","10831380"," We're going to send it down at least to VWAP in here if they can."
"10833480","10837400"," Bulls are like, I'm just going to keep buying this for one more banger right up here just so I"
"10837400","10838540"," can slap the top of the key."
"10841740","10842340"," Everyone's trained. "
"10842540","10845740"," Everyone's trained with when he gets zero dates that are price."
"10848720","10850860"," I'm going to look at the next expiry is here."
"10853820","10856800"," Can't even imagine what the 15 is prep 15 does price that. "
"10863640","10864360"," It's 1212."
"10864500","10866080"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"10868480","10870420"," Every time I take a break, something happens. "
"10870680","10871260"," So I'm going to take a break."
"10871420","10873020"," I'm going to refill in some water here."
"10873400","10874100"," Take a piss break. "
"10874100","10875360"," So I don't have to get away from you guys."
"10875900","10882060"," We've got at volatility was coming up at 1 30 p.m. He's going to walk you through what to"
"10882060","10883340"," expect in terms of volatility."
"10883800","10886460"," I think you're going to be surprised what he has to say. "
"10886720","10888360"," I haven't said what he's going to say."
"10888480","10889200"," I'm not going to."
"10889600","10890820"," I think you're going to be surprised. "
"10894180","10896020"," And it's going to be a great viewpoint."
"10896180","10899180"," I haven't heard this viewpoint at all anywhere that I've seen."
"10899320","10902180"," There might be some people with this viewpoint, but I like his viewpoint. "
"10903320","10904340"," What to expect today."
"10906100","10911780"," And we'll try to get him to talk about the news driven events, the economic calendar news driven"
"10911780","10912860"," events are coming out tomorrow."
"10913940","10916100"," And then possibly what to expect into OPEC's. "
"10917320","10924600"," We'll talk about the presser and we're going to talk about implied volatility, volatility crush and"
"10924600","10926900"," how this impacts you and what you're holding right now."
"10929740","10931180"," Into the weekend."
"10931660","10935840"," What to expect after you're going to possibly get a holiday rally or not. "
"10939040","10943220"," All these things getting your pens and papers out and you're getting your crayons out of your"
"10943220","10943680"," marine."
"10945060","10947700"," Make sure you get the ones that don't roll around off the table."
"10947700","10949040"," The triangle crayons. "
"10949980","10952940"," Then you just scratch out what he's saying to you."
"10962290","10964370"," Find out who this trap is for right now."
"10969620","10976590"," Yeah, there's ways to trade this. "
"10976750","10977610"," I mean, you could just buy."
"10978010","10979330"," I mean, you could just chase the trade."
"10979530","10979910"," You can buy. "
"10981670","10987810"," You can buy a straddle on the market and chase both sides with like one to three month options in"
"10987810","10988410"," the money stuff."
"10988610","10990350"," It's like one to three months out."
"10991190","10991990"," Chase both sides. "
"10992430","10993230"," You hold one side."
"10993450","10993530"," Chase."
"10993530","10993830"," Chase. "
"10995070","10995550"," Wherever."
"10995630","10996630"," So whichever way we go."
"10997150","11001970"," Hold the three month on the other side to hopefully come back, you know, and close. "
"11002310","11002650"," Close."
"11002810","11003870"," Whoever gap was left behind."
"11006840","11014820"," An easy way to deal with the premium that's built into this move also is to do with spreads. "
"11015380","11019640"," Express it with spread so that you don't have to worry about the vol crash."
"11019680","11022960"," If there is vol crash, there might be, you know, a vol spike."
"11029070","11032810"," Even from where we're leaving from here, you know, if they try to bloodbath us. "
"11033370","11034870"," We've had certain we've had years."
"11035050","11036330"," We have bloodbath in December."
"11036770","11037450"," They're very rare. "
"11037490","11040030"," But when they do happen, they're ugly is they're real ugly."
"11040050","11040790"," They get nasty."
"11041770","11045970"," I think the last one we sold off into Christmas or something or I think it was like Christmas Eve. "
"11046730","11048070"," We just bloodbath the entire market."
"11049810","11051010"," Not a fun experience."
"11053010","11054790"," Not a fun experience at all. "
"11056370","11057090"," Not a bull."
"11057370","11060970"," So I don't know if you know that out there, but I trade as a bull typically."
"11061430","11062810"," I'll take the opposite side of the trade. "
"11063250","11067190"," I follow the trade wherever it goes about my stances as a bull."
"11073820","11074260"," Yeah."
"11075340","11076580"," Break out your crayons. "
"11078120","11078560"," Yeah."
"11083680","11087920"," I saw my algorithms are my algorithms have a couple different scenarios."
"11088380","11090820"," One of the scenarios is we trade it sideways and down. "
"11092060","11098560"," You'll see risky bonds roll over and they're at a resistance point right now, right?"
"11098660","11099840"," You'll see the rise of TLT."
"11100520","11104940"," And they'll just take two or three opportunities in the next year to dump this market."
"11106280","11109800"," But the implication will be that they're going to they would raise rates. "
"11110700","11112680"," They would force unemployment to rise."
"11113820","11118360"," And you'd wait for that for that capitulation move right that 45 and the VIX that everybody wants"
"11118360","11118820"," to see."
"11120200","11122980"," Now there's some other problems though. "
"11123320","11131520"," If you look back historically on the market, if you look back historically at the implication that"
"11131520","11140800"," inflation is going to rapidly decrease this year, that the Fed always pivots right around now right"
"11140800","11143500"," now actually is when the Fed actually pivots unannounced."
"11144360","11150540"," Now without having unemployment high right and it's showing that we're not truly at a bottom."
"11150880","11157240"," So can my positive to you is can they create a shock to like trigger that downward move. "
"11157680","11161640"," You'll get some some news saying that we're getting higher unemployment figures."
"11162620","11169500"," We start to head lower sooner and the depth of that of that that move down."
"11169780","11170500"," It's not so deep. "
"11170500","11171720"," It's 3100."
"11172400","11174440"," It's not twenty four hundred twenty six hundred."
"11174660","11175820"," It's not sixteen hundred. "
"11176240","11181020"," But the longer we do trade it sideways, the longer the Fed doesn't."
"11181380","11186480"," The longer the Fed doesn't raise rates drastically."
"11187360","11190800"," It opens the door down the road to much much lower lows. "
"11195390","11201070"," So there's some there's some mechanics in the background and that they're a hammer on a nail."
"11201070","11206310"," I see guys out there get this past couple of days and seeing people trying to dissect the CPI"
"11206310","11207850"," number and I'm like, what are they doing?"
"11208170","11211010"," It says nothing to do with with the market."
"11211290","11212730"," It says nothing to fucking do with the market. "
"11212870","11219250"," The markets like it's like a hammer and a nail, you know, and the only one the only bottom."
"11220010","11222950"," The only bottom as a as a trader and as an investor."
"11224450","11226610"," Are you looking for a bottom for a bull run?"
"11226730","11228410"," It's always a high unemployment rate. "
"11231010","11233850"," Inflation peeking, Fed's cut rates."
"11234410","11236130"," Same time you'll see the capitulation move."
"11236690","11238710"," It's like a it's like a golden magic thing. "
"11240910","11242450"," It's a golden magic thing."
"11242550","11244650"," Every time you see it happen, you're like, hey, and there it goes."
"11248530","11252390"," So until then they can they can drag this out sideways as long as they want. "
"11252470","11254210"," But eventually it's going to get ugly."
"11254950","11256390"," You start breaking real shit."
"11257350","11257610"," Right. "
"11257790","11259070"," You start doing real damage."
"11260690","11263170"," And not the kind you want to see on Main Street."
"11264950","11268190"," And that, you know, with modern modern modern monetary theory. "
"11268830","11270650"," They're trying to engineer this to not happen."
"11270810","11271770"," They're trying to engineer this."
"11272050","11275330"," And so if they engineer it down to 3100, everybody's happy. "
"11277290","11281070"," The longer they drag this out, the more recession comes into play."
"11283030","11285290"," Things get real real real real nasty."
"11289670","11291270"," He's got dang bulls. "
"11291270","11292990"," Keep trying to buy this dip, man."
"11293050","11293710"," Look at these bulls."
"11294590","11295450"," These bulls. "
"11296750","11298530"," These got dang dealers."
"11313420","11315400"," You know, you guys, I'll show you this."
"11315520","11315660"," You guys. "
"11315880","11318060"," I'll give you guys five minutes on this."
"11318180","11320960"," I'll make it really, really simple for you."
"11320960","11321240"," Okay. "
"11323720","11325820"," I'll go through it real quick with you if I can."
"11326020","11326640"," Hold on a second here."
"11328000","11329400"," I'll show you guys some instances. "
"11332220","11332620"," Okay."
"11332780","11336180"," We'll keep it simple for the dumb trader out there."
"11336380","11340060"," If you're not, well, I guess if you don't have a lot going on, I've been there. "
"11340480","11341300"," I've run the wheel."
"11342860","11346520"," Went down the rabbit hole with condors and with flies."
"11351140","11352740"," I'm just too tired for that stuff anymore. "
"11353400","11354400"," I like to keep the shit simple."
"11355500","11356500"," The simpler the better."
"11356880","11358480"," The older they get, the simpler I want to keep the shit. "
"11359780","11361860"," So here, I'll set this up in the background for you."
"11363500","11365300"," You know, this doesn't mean that you should take this."
"11365540","11367600"," This is not financial advice in any way, shape or form. "
"11368620","11371180"," I don't want you to take this as financial advice."
"11373360","11374660"," You guys want to go through this real quick?"
"11374980","11375280"," I can."
"11375280","11376760"," I'll go through this briefly. "
"11379700","11381380"," I'll bring up SPX here."
"11382740","11383820"," Here's a second here."
"11385500","11386800"," I'll bring up SPX. "
"11387340","11388700"," Got a nice clean chart here for you."
"11388800","11389540"," Nice and clean, sexy."
"11403020","11404220"," Federal funds rate. "
"11406480","11407340"," Hold on."
"11413070","11414090"," Sorry about that."
"11425320","11428600"," Can I bring this into a different window or something, right?"
"11430600","11431440"," Hold on here. "
"11432340","11433840"," Do a comparison fit."
"11434640","11435080"," Here we go."
"11435660","11436720"," Effective Federal funds rate. "
"11437020","11437480"," Bring that one up."
"11437660","11440640"," No, hold on."
"11440640","11441880"," Check the new pane. "
"11442640","11443160"," There we go."
"11444600","11449000"," We'll look at the inflation rate and new pane."
"11449480","11449980"," It's a big one. "
"11450740","11451660"," We'll just look at these two right here."
"11453840","11454200"," Yeah."
"11454320","11456060"," See, you got, I want you to pair. "
"11460880","11462320"," Let's just look at this, okay?"
"11462740","11465500"," You know, you got people arguing about inflation coming down, okay?"
"11466560","11469740"," What kind of inflation numbers in CPI are they looking for?"
"11470140","11470580"," PPI."
"11470780","11471180"," It doesn't matter."
"11472240","11473780"," You got the Fed funds rate, right?"
"11474080","11475320"," That's a nominal difference. "
"11475660","11480220"," So this means more at 5% than 20% did in the 1970s, right?"
"11481920","11482860"," We'll look at a weekly."
"11485120","11486760"," You can see the curl over here, right?"
"11488520","11498440"," And you can see moments in the past here where you see"
"11498440","11499700"," this role right here, right?"
"11501620","11503300"," See that inflation role right here?"
"11503560","11506700"," And you see where the Fed cut the rates bam, right?"
"11507480","11510440"," You can show you other instances of this in the past where they've done this, right?"
"11511240","11512540"," You can see it right here, the role."
"11514080","11515320"," Start rolling over. "
"11517760","11523080"," And you can see here, the Fed cuts the rates back here, right?"
"11523260","11525120"," And you can see the role in inflation back here."
"11525200","11527340"," You can see all kinds of instances of this in the past."
"11528620","11530660"," I'm going to keep that this part simple, okay?"
"11531480","11532980"," I'll show you this right now, okay?"
"11533780","11537260"," And then I'll bring up unemployment. "
"11538900","11539720"," Hold on."
"11541000","11541960"," Let me get rid of that."
"11545740","11547480"," I'm going to show you unemployment here, okay?"
"11549880","11551020"," There we go, new pain. "
"11553500","11555120"," And I want you to see this."
"11555300","11557140"," This is signaling bottoms in our market."
"11560750","11562470"," See the rise here, right?"
"11562670","11563670"," Of unemployment, right?"
"11563850","11565270"," The rise of unemployment, right?"
"11566070","11569290"," You see the rise of unemployment to bottom of our market, right?"
"11569510","11570290"," Leveling off here. "
"11570850","11571750"," Rise of unemployment."
"11572450","11572890"," Big one."
"11573150","11573350"," Unemployment. "
"11573890","11574090"," Always unemployment."
"11575450","11576010"," Rise of unemployment."
"11576270","11578490"," You see a bottom of the market, right?"
"11579750","11581130"," See this radio unemployment, right?"
"11581610","11582850"," Rise unemployment right here, right?"
"11583470","11585430"," Fed cuts the rates, inflation's going down. "
"11585750","11587250"," Rise unemployment, right?"
"11587410","11588130"," It's a big one, right?"
"11588130","11588990"," Remember this says, right?"
"11589210","11589630"," Two thousand."
"11590470","11591750"," Same thing over here."
"11591870","11593330"," You see unemployment rising, right?"
"11594270","11595830"," Way to see this stuff's important. "
"11596190","11597570"," See inflation coming down."
"11597710","11600130"," You see the Fed cuts rates, right?"
"11600830","11602670"," So you're not seeing that right now, are you?"
"11603290","11605310"," You're seeing the rollover of inflation."
"11606050","11611490"," You're seeing the Fed fund rates rising, and you're not seeing a reaction down here, right?"
"11611730","11612110"," With unemployment. "
"11612950","11617170"," So you really want to, in a perfect world, you want to see this coming up."
"11617170","11619310"," You'd be at a bottom right now."
"11619570","11620090"," Does that make sense?"
"11620690","11623850"," And you're not getting this right now in the market. "
"11624710","11629810"," And so because you're not getting this in the market right now, we have to trigger this at some"
"11629810","11630130"," point."
"11630230","11632810"," You have to start to see this number come higher."
"11633890","11635270"," And you're not seeing that. "
"11635430","11642070"," So my point to you, if you're a bull out there is, does this match up to a real bottom?"
"11642510","11642970"," And it's not."
"11643350","11643890"," It's not."
"11643890","11649670"," So what happens is do we play this out in 2024 and have to watch this rate slowly go up?"
"11649990","11653790"," Do we shock here so that we get an actual jump start?"
"11654110","11658470"," Sorry, I'm doing being so fast at that, but at least the jump start, right?"
"11658810","11660250"," But the Fed's actually cut rates. "
"11660890","11663250"," So you'll see this curling over, you'll see this coming up."
"11663850","11665770"," And do you understand what I'm saying about this?"
"11666390","11669750"," So when people are out there talking about the fucking yield, sorry for swearing, but the yield"
"11669750","11672070"," curve and all that are the nonsense out there."
"11672070","11678930"," I guarantee you pull up a yield curve and you put it towards declines and declines historically. "
"11679670","11681190"," It doesn't always match up to declines."
"11682230","11682810"," So be careful."
"11683150","11684370"," If there's a trader, be careful. "
"11685070","11688490"," Be care is an investor, be careful about all this yield curve."
"11688910","11692010"," It means nothing to you, but really means something to you."
"11692010","11695190"," If you want to buy a bottom in this market is watching this happen. "
"11696010","11700070"," You really want to watch this because you see this, right?"
"11700070","11705510"," If you want to see this, then you see the Fed cut rates that are probably probably coincide with a"
"11705510","11706310"," bottom in the market."
"11707530","11709890"," This is the dumb trader way of doing things."
"11710510","11713710"," I don't care about what they're selling you and the fees that they're getting. "
"11713870","11718750"," If you're a trader, an investor is the dumb way for you to figure out are we at an actual"
"11718750","11719070"," bottom."
"11719770","11722930"," We're not seeing that right now with the unemployment rate."
"11725490","11727330"," You guys track what I'm saying out there?"
"11727330","11728930"," It's a very simple way for you. "
"11729090","11732970"," You can pause this video, go back, look at how you put those charts up."
"11735190","11739850"," You want to go back and check that every month, every two months."
"11740070","11744790"," I don't care if the market's going up from now into the end of the year. "
"11744990","11748030"," It's crazy is the market can go up here, right?"
"11748570","11750250"," Instead of going so down, right?"
"11750550","11754610"," It can go up actually here for the next year and they can crash it in a year from now"
"11754610","11755970"," when an unemployment rate comes up."
"11755970","11757810"," So you get a good market, right?"
"11758490","11761930"," You'd literally have unemployment start coming up, right?"
"11762110","11765230"," And then they would crash it down to like 3,100, 3,200."
"11766630","11768170"," Now, if they don't do that, right?"
"11768570","11770710"," If the Fed's not boxed into a corner, what happens?"
"11771290","11776390"," We trade sideways and down into next year and you start seeing real deep lows and real deep damage"
"11776390","11778710"," done to the economy and the stock market. "
"11783540","11785680"," You guys, it's very simple and direct."
"11785680","11790980"," So you could literally like stop listening to anyone on Fintuit."
"11792440","11798880"," Now, of course, this might not play out in the next month or two months or three months, but I"
"11798880","11804820"," promise you, if you're a bull out there, if you're a bear out there, over a timeframe of one year,"
"11805080","11808000"," two years, three years from now, you're looking for that for a bottom. "
"11809860","11811860"," Very simple, very straightforward."
"11811860","11816440"," As a matter of fact, I got this from in the money from Adam or Mike, or Mike who think"
"11816440","11819480"," his name is, and he put it towards that."
"11819560","11822360"," I tried to explain to people that they weren't listening to me and I was like, all right, whatever. "
"11822720","11826280"," I was like, I gotta get some way to figure out how to explain this to people."
"11826420","11828920"," And sure enough, he did a very good job of it."
"11829120","11830040"," It's a very simple thing. "
"11831520","11832900"," Put up yields over."
"11833300","11838280"," I can show you a yield chart where it doesn't match up to market decline in death."
"11839120","11841940"," The yields aren't going to do it for you as a trader or as an investor. "
"11842380","11843680"," You need simple ways, right?"
"11844060","11849240"," You look towards the bond market to find out if there's internal mechanical problems in the market."
"11849620","11854280"," Why is the market declining as we're raising rates when usually the market should be going up?"
"11855120","11861660"," Believe it or not, if the Fed's got people believing that they're working on the market, on"
"11861660","11863640"," dropping inflation, the market should still go up."
"11863640","11868440"," But there's internal mechanical problems within the market right now where it was this year in this"
"11868440","11868680"," decline. "
"11869140","11873820"," And they run this, all this bullshit by you saying that the market's doing the job for the Fed."
"11874020","11875020"," That's a crock of shit."
"11876980","11878180"," That's all a crock of shit. "
"11878420","11878920"," Promise you."
"11881640","11884460"," Probably shouldn't be talking about this stuff in a live stream, but whatever."
"11885920","11887780"," So that's what you're looking for if you're a bull. "
"11888560","11893520"," Even if you're a bear, if you're a bull, you want to buy a bottom of the market in safety."
"11894060","11895180"," That's what you're looking for right there."
"11896300","11901680"," That's time memorial since the beginning of our stock market, the beginning all through all of it. "
"11905280","11907160"," And what's the other thing you're looking for, right?"
"11907400","11911760"," You're looking for these are hard concepts to grasp, right?"
"11913660","11916580"," On that same note where I just talked to you about, right?"
"11916720","11918220"," I'm going to delete all this stuff."
"11922210","11924210"," It's all the nonsense that you hear out there."
"11924250","11925470"," It means nothing, right?"
"11926030","11927130"," I mean, it means something. "
"11927450","11928970"," You got to sell somebody that you're smart."
"11929590","11930750"," You have to sell somebody."
"11931930","11933570"," People have to sell like an image, right?"
"11933710","11934530"," That the south is smart. "
"11936070","11940270"," Then you find out in the background that they're just pumping bullshit to you and collecting fees."
"11942390","11945150"," And along the way, they were buying the zero dates, right?"
"11945410","11948250"," The zero date, the background, that's what they were doing."
"11948250","11957960"," So you have to sell an image, especially if you're a smart person in real life. "
"11958900","11961940"," If you're an intelligent person, you get a great degree in your doctor or your engineer."
"11962480","11964920"," You want to hear someone that sounds like they know what they're talking about?"
"11969880","11972520"," You keep going down that rabbit hole and you keep losing money."
"11972960","11974460"," I promise you, you'll dumb stuff down. "
"11974740","11977940"," You'll get very dumb in your trade."
"11977940","11979720"," Okay, so this is the weekly moving average."
"11980660","11982200"," Big fat red line, right?"
"11986340","11988180"," On your own, just go and look at it. "
"11989040","11991880"," On your own, you'll see we interact with it at bottoms."
"11992560","11996820"," And once we slip under, we stay under, right?"
"11997040","11998140"," We start slipping under it."
"12000000","12002280"," Time passes, right?"
"12002400","12003720"," You spend enough time down here. "
"12004480","12006860"," You will trade deep below it."
"12009080","12017080"," Historically, whenever we trade below it, whenever you start to see an extension of a down market,"
"12017300","12017380"," right?"
"12017560","12019400"," So we're talking about the Fed today, right?"
"12019900","12023140"," Because the Fed didn't want to stretch this out into next year."
"12023820","12026940"," Is the Fed in a corner where they have to cut rates?"
"12028360","12028400"," Right?"
"12028800","12030120"," So what are they implying?"
"12030920","12036240"," They're implying to you that what's being implied here is that the Fed knows that if they spend"
"12036240","12041900"," enough time down here trying to trade this market sideways, we're going to end up interacting once"
"12041900","12047380"," again with a weekly moving average, a 200 weekly moving average, right over the course of this"
"12047380","12047600"," year. "
"12048220","12049280"," Here, let me just second here."
"12050120","12057460"," We know historically every time, every single time, that if we spend enough time down here, right?"
"12059100","12060000"," Hang tight here."
"12061540","12066340"," Say this starts coming up and we come down and we trade this market sideways and let's say we go,"
"12066520","12071440"," hey, we're going to stick with our plan and we're going to keep doing rates slow increments, right?"
"12071600","12073140"," We start spending time down here. "
"12073580","12077500"," Whenever we've done that, we start making some pretty big lows down here."
"12078040","12081560"," Start looking towards numbers that are way, way, way, way lower."
"12081740","12082220"," Does that make sense?"
"12082880","12083860"," You'll make a tax on this. "
"12085000","12089780"," You'll make a tax on this weekly moving average."
"12090080","12091060"," Once you're underneath it, right?"
"12091660","12095120"," Between now and January of next year, you're going to end up getting one of these moves."
"12095720","12096860"," These are deep moves. "
"12097020","12101360"," When you start making these deep plunges down here, this is real damage that gets done."
"12101740","12105900"," The Fed has to think about that when they come into this meeting today."
"12106120","12109800"," They have to think about, well, do we just try to jump-start it here and get us moving?"
"12110480","12111260"," Does that make sense?"
"12112280","12115480"," What do we carry on sideways and slip underneath the weekly moving average?"
"12116220","12121000"," The more time they spend on it, so the time that they have to make this decision, the box is"
"12121000","12124580"," as quickly coming in on them. "
"12125880","12127140"," Because what they can do is this."
"12129920","12133000"," What they can say is, well, we'll try to work on getting the unemployment rate up."
"12133060","12133880"," They're going to want to tell you that. "
"12134380","12136960"," Get a quick jump-start off this, trade this up."
"12137900","12142400"," Then once unemployment gets high in 2024, they can dump the market to right here."
"12143120","12146260"," Maybe slightly below it, and they just keep moving on. "
"12146720","12149180"," That's called manipulating the market."
"12149840","12152600"," This is the attempt they will try to do."
"12153760","12159420"," If the market, quote-unquote, believes that they're doing something for inflation, they'll be"
"12159420","12164120"," selling you this idea so that they can just carry on in 2024. "
"12164720","12167020"," I want you to be aware of all this very simple concepts."
"12169280","12170700"," Very, very simple concepts."
"12171000","12172460"," Why is the Fed box in?"
"12172640","12174360"," You could tell you right now why they're boxed in. "
"12174700","12176220"," I just showed it to you in five minutes."
"12176220","12178760"," It took five minutes to explain all this to you."
"12180580","12181240"," Five minutes. "
"12181400","12182180"," These are huge moves."
"12182920","12184880"," Do you need to have all of this trade?"
"12185560","12185660"," No."
"12186500","12189820"," If you find out something different today, this trade down here is monster. "
"12191600","12193000"," You don't need to trade this today."
"12193140","12195180"," If you find out today, they're going to try to jump-start this up."
"12195280","12196720"," You've got a huge trade above here. "
"12197700","12199180"," That's what you're looking for today."
"12199320","12201380"," You're looking here to find out what the Fed says."
"12202040","12203880"," What kind of bullshit they're trying to swing to you. "
"12204420","12209400"," Trying to sell to you as a trader, as an investor."
"12211720","12212300"," Does that make sense?"
"12213640","12216000"," In the longer that they don't do it, right?"
"12216860","12220600"," They get boxed in more and more and more heading into springtime."
"12220780","12223220"," They get boxed into this where they don't have a choice. "
"12227850","12229650"," You guys understand what I'm saying to you?"
"12234510","12237550"," You guys got to understand we're looking over a time frame of years here."
"12237550","12240230"," If you get your Santa rally, right?"
"12240650","12245410"," If you get puns off sides, everybody thinks we're going up."
"12246070","12249230"," They do one more quick throwover come beginning of the year. "
"12249650","12251130"," They can slam that WMA."
"12252490","12254790"," You can slam that down in January and March."
"12255510","12257850"," Even with a holiday rally, slam it down. "
"12258550","12259490"," You've got everybody long."
"12259970","12261650"," You've got no shorts on the market."
"12262650","12263410"," No one gets paid. "
"12264070","12265070"," They get their slam down."
"12265230","12267170"," We rocket ship up for the next year."
"12267170","12269070"," Meanwhile, you see destruction everywhere. "
"12269410","12269930"," We're just complaining."
"12270990","12273930"," And then they dump that ship by next year."
"12275210","12276610"," Probably high probability. "
"12277310","12278370"," I'm not saying it's going to happen."
"12278910","12282290"," This is not financial advice at all."
"12282950","12288890"," But I want you to realize that there are some simple ways for you to read the market, read the"
"12288890","12295310"," Fed, and figure out what the heck they're doing without having to get all complicated. "
"12296990","12297470"," Complicating."
"12299250","12303090"," Because the complicating out there is I find it wild."
"12305590","12307190"," It's like it's like the it's like. "
"12307470","12312610"," I don't know when Dr. Evil tries to describe his father, right?"
"12313610","12317430"," He likes all squirrel nuts to a chestnut to a to a squirrel or something."
"12317650","12318510"," I don't know what that is, but."
"12327660","12331020"," Trust me 100% I can show it to you all through history. "
"12332340","12333300"," Well, not trust me."
"12333640","12339800"," This might not work, but I'm sure that the hammer and the nail that is the Fed in the treasury"
"12339800","12340200"," department."
"12341080","12343160"," This is how they this is how they deal with stuff. "
"12343540","12344860"," So the Fed is lying to you."
"12345200","12347480"," When I tell you on Twitter, the Fed is lying to you."
"12347480","12350080"," I assure you that they are lying to you. "
"12350280","12353320"," And I also assure you that they have to sell."
"12355060","12359460"," They have to sell the market that they're that they're making progress, right?"
"12359780","12361940"," There's like this whole thing they're going to do to sell to you."
"12363040","12366360"," They either they have to sell to you that they're making progress that they're not. "
"12366620","12367840"," And you have to believe it."
"12368060","12369560"," The market has to believe it."
"12369940","12374100"," That's why you look towards the bond market because the bond market will tell you if they believe"
"12374100","12374640"," it or not. "
"12374640","12376180"," And if they do believe it, right?"
"12376360","12380580"," There's other ways for you to see if the bond market accepts that the Fed is working on these"
"12380580","12380940"," issues."
"12383680","12388160"," And you could see that earlier this year that the bond market did not believe that the Fed was"
"12388160","12389140"," working on these issues."
"12395560","12397380"," Did that work for was that good?"
"12397840","12400180"," Was that a decent explanation or was that a horrible explanation?"

"12455340","12456700"," You listen to Jerome Powell."

"12460640","12462960"," You see the little Fed, little Fed chair presidents. "

"12470040","12471800"," You've seen that right past month or two."
"12472260","12475640"," They spread the shit around because they don't know what's going to happen."
"12477080","12479520"," If they're all together and something, they know it's going to happen. "
"12479540","12481120"," They don't know it's going to happen right now."

"14320520","14321180"," Uh-oh. "
"14322460","14323780"," I don't know what just happened here."
"14328190","14330250"," I guess it's not comparing today."
"14332870","14338290"," This heads up as a divergence in the bond market versus spy hair trying to recover. "
"14347380","14348720"," What do I think is going to happen?"
"14352240","14355220"," Uh, I think they're going to swing high, swing low, and murder everything."
"14364810","14366950"," And today, that's what I think they do."
"14373650","14375910"," I think they swing high, swing low, and murder everything. "
"14375910","14377910"," Then you get J-Paw come out."
"14380170","14382390"," And I think he might be dumbish."
"14387500","14389640"," I like the idea of 50 BPS. "
"14390380","14391080"," I just wasn't good."
"14391300","14393580"," I'm on the train for 50 BPS."
"14394420","14396700"," Uh, maybe a more dumbish terminal rate. "
"14398100","14405220"," Uh, all in the language of his, uh, of his speech or his presser."
"14405480","14415780"," Usually those are not always, but sometimes during his, uh, sometimes during his, um,"
"14419790","14428510"," uh, presser, you'll feel like save, they'll save the one, like the one reporter that asks the hard"
"14428510","14430430"," questions and tries to pin him down."
"14431530","14437350"," He'll get all bearish, hawkish, and you'll be just blasting up, blasting up, and all of a sudden"
"14437350","14438050"," it'll just reverse. "
"14439590","14443370"," Because you didn't listen to the last, you know, two minutes of the 20 minute presser."
"14443730","14444750"," You're like, shit."
"14445510","14446770"," What's he saying right now?"
"14454940","14457480"," I always like to watch his pressers right to the end. "
"14464320","14469700"," Yeah, it's, uh, you get the release of two, and then 230, he does the interviewing."
"14474920","14475560"," I don't know."
"14475700","14479480"," I think, I think if you get the rocket ship that they're going to try to make it so reverse,"
"14479480","14486080"," is what we have to do is watch the put structure after and see if more puts come into the"
"14486080","14490620"," market in case we reverse off a, um, a rip higher. "
"14490720","14496300"," If we rip higher and you don't see, um, puts place like one to three months out."
"14497880","14504100"," I guess, I guess as a, as a, as a bull, you'd be looking for that."
"14504620","14508300"," You're looking to see if you see puts coming back into the market after we get a rip, if it"
"14508300","14508720"," rips higher. "
"14513060","14519820"," We have this, uh, I don't like how much, I don't like how much, uh, options are costing right now."
"14519840","14520280"," I really don't."
"14520380","14520860"," I'll be honest with them. "
"14520980","14521820"," Both sides of the trade."
"14523700","14526180"," They don't like, uh, I don't like it."
"14536990","14538510"," I'll be 100% honest with you. "
"14538570","14540310"," I'm not, uh, I'm not a fan here."
"14547360","14553080"," So I got some, uh, news keyed up for you."
"14560940","14563180"," This is going to be the news release here. "
"14564700","14571560"," I'm going to put another one over here for 230, uh, for the presser to start."
"14571900","14572740"," Do you guys want?"
"14574040","14580800"," Do you guys want to listen to, uh, do you want to listen to J-POW from my, or you"
"14580800","14583600"," want to listen to J-POW from Miami 230 maybe?"
"14584600","14591220"," We'll have the news squawk talk about, uh, try to interpret what the new, the presser, or the"
"14591220","14596720"," releases, the rate decision at two."
"14596940","14600900"," So we'll let the, the news squawk, we're surely expecting the federal best repair facilities. "
"14610300","14612240"," So what we'll do is at 130 here."
"14612360","14613200"," It's coming up here soon."

"14618840","14619440"," do his thing. "
"14620140","14621100"," Some chat and talk."
"14628120","14632100"," And then, uh, you know what we'll do is we'll bring him on right now."
"14632200","14632720"," You know what I'm going to do?"
"14633140","14637040"," I'm going to, I'm going to send him a new, um, give me a second here, okay?"
"14640560","14644560"," I'm going to mute this real quick, and I'm going to put him down on the bottom left hand corner"
"14644560","14649810"," of this pink tape for a second here. "

"15997180","15998880"," You want to say something real quick again?"
"15999820","16000220"," Sure."
"16003040","16012000"," You want to talk about the press conference and the buffoonery that is the press conference, we can"
"16012000","16015240"," get right into that, which is kind of a funny topic. "
"16021350","16022370"," Yeah, I think we can hear you here."
"16022550","16034280"," I guess what the couple of things I wanted to talk to you about was the"
"16034280","16039060"," volatility that's built into this event and then the volatility built into tomorrow."
"16039640","16043800"," It seemed like it was, it was implied that there's some volatility built into tomorrow. "
"16045620","16047920"," The implied vol, the vol crush that could happen."
"16048280","16049620"," And then of course during the presser."
"16052600","16054160"," So did you get that chart I sent you?"
"16055060","16055500"," Yeah. "
"16055800","16057680"," On my end they can, on my end they can see it."
"16058280","16058600"," Okay."
"16059260","16065200"," So basically what that is, is a spread where I sold, I do this every quarter. "
"16065200","16074360"," I sell Wednesday of off X week and I own Friday because the pricing in that spread"
"16074360","16079020"," anticipates SPY going ex-dividend on Friday."
"16079380","16085140"," So I usually get it for like 25, 28 cents or something."
"16085140","16094140"," And I mean that trade, I spread it out across, you know, 200 or 300 SPX points and it"
"16094140","16096360"," very rarely fails me. "
"16096500","16102340"," In fact, you know, if I just did four trades a year, if I just traded four weeks a year"
"16102340","16106880"," and I did that, I'd have, you know, 200% return just on that."
"16107120","16113560"," But like obviously I make mistakes, you know, keeping myself interested in markets, right?"
"16113560","16116240"," So I'll trade earnings events and things like that."
"16116440","16122820"," But, but I mean that right there is a bread and butter trade that anyone can do. "
"16123040","16123840"," It's not that hard."
"16124660","16130180"," You sell Wednesday on Friday, a couple quarters a year, the Fed is the Wednesday."
"16131200","16134240"," Like in June it was, in September it was the week after. "
"16137700","16145080"," Yeah, so when you buy SPY for 25 to 30 cents, right?"
"16145240","16149660"," For two days after the Fed mean that that's the other thing too is the Fed meeting comes on."
"16151200","16151720"," Right."
"16152160","16153260"," The process to 30. "
"16153620","16160320"," So like the front is going to burn up as fast as, you know, you can imagine and it does"
"16160320","16162060"," like you could chart these things on."
"16162060","16168760"," So you can take the, which I was trying to send you a chart of the actual spread."
"16169300","16172420"," It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't look right. "
"16172860","16178480"," But, but it's that simple."
"16178860","16179660"," It really is."
"16180100","16184280"," Sometimes the simplest trades work when you're using ball events when you're trying to sell ball"
"16184280","16185980"," and own back ball, right?"
"16186640","16191280"," Yeah, we're, I was talking about it earlier that the option sellers today are cleaning up. "
"16191280","16195180"," We have some, some people inside the street or inside the chat already saying this earlier that"
"16195180","16196320"," they're closing them out right now."
"16197260","16199260"," Yeah, it's almost too late."
"16200400","16202840"," They start crushing ball before the meeting. "
"16203860","16210700"," And I've seen, you know, on Fed days, they start to hammer it before the Euro close, you know, they"
"16210700","16212240"," start hammering the ball."
"16212240","16220920"," And, I mean, that's a simplistic way of saying it, but essentially the options just start falling"
"16220920","16221280"," in value."
"16221720","16222300"," That's what it is. "
"16222600","16223500"," Who's doing it?"
"16223760","16228040"," I'm not, I'm not going to be like one of those guys who pretends to know who's doing it."
"16228560","16229800"," But it's happening, right?"
"16230400","16231280"," The prices are going down."
"16231740","16236700"," So yesterday I was out of almost everything that I do, almost everything. "
"16236700","16242600"," I kept a couple on just to, almost for intellectual curiosity and just to see how they were active"
"16242600","16243400"," today and."
"16243940","16244940"," We saw it on the third."
"16245100","16248000"," We saw it on the last day of November, right?"
"16248180","16251000"," And then we saw it again or see, or we saw it again just the yesterday. "
"16253380","16257580"," Matter of fact, my, I've got a hedge for March that was in some pain."
"16258880","16260100"," Heading into the open yesterday."
"16260960","16262040"," Yeah, I mean. "
"16263980","16266700"," See, you want to talk about Vicks and how stupid that is."
"16267700","16273040"," Because it's a zero DTEs conversation is what it is."
"16273980","16275120"," You want to talk about that?"
"16275340","16275900"," Yeah, definitely. "
"16276280","16276700"," You just talk."
"16276880","16277160"," I'm listening."
"16277720","16285680"," What people don't get is on like saying November 30th, they're looking at Vicks probably 18 and"
"16285680","16287660"," they're saying, oh, no one's afraid. "
"16287660","16288400"," Well."
"16289540","16293700"," The options that the Vicks are pricing are a month ahead."
"16294140","16297100"," They rolled from like 29 to 43 days. "
"16297420","16301800"," I'm pretty sure that's right, but don't quote me on that anyway."
"16302500","16304880"," So that window is after Christmas."
"16305400","16308140"," So the Vicks isn't really telling you anything. "
"16308360","16309760"," It's not telling you anything, right?"
"16311260","16311940"," You can, you can."
"16312680","16317960"," What I watch is Vicks nine day and that is, you know, rolling nine day."
"16318780","16319260"," Yes. "
"16319860","16324600"," And that tells you more because everyone's in those, you know, the vast majority of options are"
"16324600","16325000"," being done."
"16325760","16328660"," Zero one and they're being done in size by institution."
"16329020","16333140"," So, so, so why are you looking at 30 days out?"
"16333500","16334460"," It's a waste of time. "
"16334680","16335400"," It doesn't tell you anything."
"16335840","16336460"," People want to happen."
"16336760","16338740"," People want it to have predictive value. "
"16338940","16340400"," It has zero predictive value."
"16340400","16343800"," I mean, I've changed my wording like three times."
"16343980","16345340"," It's making jokes about the wall surface. "
"16345680","16345780"," Okay."
"16345980","16354140"," So, so everyone's in the zero to one and, and they're doing pretty well because like when you have"
"16354140","16360140"," a day like November 10th last month where the QBQ went up like fricking 7% a day."
"16360940","16366080"," Those guys are taking like a 30 cent option, making 30 bucks on it and you're like, wow. "
"16366380","16366660"," Okay."
"16367840","16373760"," It was so I guess the zero day complex right now is unreal right now and watching how that how"
"16373760","16374600"," they come coming in and."
"16375080","16378240"," And trade I've never seen it like like I have the past couple months. "
"16378480","16383820"," It's it's it's grown because it's it's it's a byproduct of that policy."
"16384240","16384439"," Okay."
"16384860","16386919"," So I can see I can loop this all in for you. "
"16388360","16389619"," People were searching for you."
"16389900","16393000"," They came up with a lot of strategies and the demand is there."
"16393000","16399720"," So, like the CME can pump it out like the meme stop that meme stock baskets that they're doing too"
"16399720","16400099"," or no. "
"16400460","16401939"," So you throw another basket."
"16402000","16403540"," I honestly can't talk."
"16403540","16406180"," I can't talk about meme stuff because I just don't know it. "
"16406360","16406640"," Yeah."
"16406960","16407860"," Like I never go there."
"16408520","16413160"," I got asked about it on a podcast yesterday as like I don't dig into these companies because"
"16413160","16413779"," there's zeros. "
"16413820","16418919"," And so like the fact they're saving hurts right by letting them do a bond offering because the"
"16418919","16419680"," stocks three bucks."
"16419680","16420960"," Like I just don't dig."
"16421360","16421919"," Yeah. "
"16421980","16426779"," They're running these news articles saying that they're now creating these these meme stock baskets"
"16426779","16427919"," that these funds are."
"16428720","16430140"," You know, shorting down."
"16431119","16434500"," To super oversold and they jump right in there. "
"16436220","16437480"," Pumping them back up again."
"16438160","16438720"," Yeah."
"16439279","16440080"," And so the zero thing. "
"16440259","16445320"," I mean, if you're a trader, if you're a trader, you love that because it's just another"
"16445320","16445840"," opportunity."
"16445840","16447140"," There's volume there."
"16447380","16448800"," Like AMC options. "
"16448960","16450779"," I even looked like a week ago."
"16451259","16455800"," AMC options is still a top 20 daily option volume trade."
"16456340","16457320"," If you can believe it. "
"16457660","16458439"," It still is."
"16458720","16459400"," That's not real."
"16459580","16460240"," Traders, right?"
"16460520","16461380"," I don't really think. "
"16463360","16465119"," What's the stock seven, six bucks?"
"16465540","16466580"," I mean, it is retail."
"16467080","16469460"," I think it's even lower or it was lower this past week."
"16469560","16471200"," I thought I don't don't track them at all. "
"16471439","16472439"," I just trade spy."
"16475570","16476090"," Yeah."
"16476490","16476630"," Yeah. "
"16476630","16477250"," Yeah."
"16477310","16477630"," I'll trade."
"16477810","16478410"," I'll trade the menu. "
"16478550","16480169"," I have to go ahead."
"16480169","16481290"," Hey, hey, hey."
"16481290","16481750"," Hey, dude. "
"16481990","16485869"," Why spy when SPX is 40, 60 tax, right?"
"16486250","16486270"," Yeah."
"16486710","16487009"," 40."
"16488250","16490710"," 40 short term 60 long term, right?"
"16490950","16493110"," So like if you end, it's not European. "
"16493410","16495710"," So that means they can't pull it away from you spy."
"16495950","16498169"," They can take it away at any time if you're deep in the money, right?"
"16498430","16501630"," So, so SPX has like those benefits right there."
"16501630","16504090"," So people should be trading SPX over spy. "
"16504790","16507009"," Except in the situation they just gave you."
"16507410","16507570"," Okay."
"16508090","16512029"," Which was, you know, say that again for the crowd because I don't think they, I think they're"
"16512029","16513790"," paying premium for. "
"16514790","16515790"," Bad options."
"16516970","16517490"," Good."
"16517490","16518869"," I mean, even if it goes up. "
"16520720","16522700"," What you're buying them, at least in the buy."
"16523000","16523720"," What do you want me?"
"16524000","16528660"," What do you want me to dig deeper into the tax applications of SPX options or spy?"
"16529480","16529640"," Yeah."
"16529640","16533820"," I like, I like the tax implications of SPX, but from the other side of it. "
"16534980","16538380"," I like the money that's made the cash for me, at least."
"16538599","16542800"," Well, most of my accounts thought on non spy specific zero dates."
"16543599","16544700"," It's all on spreads. "
"16546360","16548960"," Oversold, oversold, overbought conditions."
"16549860","16551160"," But then I'll come in, of course."
"16551439","16555220"," And I've got the Vegas Vegas bets accounts. "
"16557419","16562700"," And, you know, it's like, let's go in there with a, you know, a couple grand to five grand."
"16563060","16566400"," I used to be able to go in with more with, with more weight by."
"16567320","16568200"," A lot of weight. "
"16568520","16573480"," And then I noticed that I felt like that, I feel like that the dealer, the order flow sellers are"
"16573480","16574980"," packaging me up with other people and."
"16575919","16577560"," I was getting, I was getting bad order flow."
"16577700","16581080"," So, uh, and plus in this market. "
"16581080","16586380"," Uh, we were discussing earlier how you could be in a bad trade in a bull run."
"16586500","16588720"," And it would eventually work itself out."
"16588860","16592279"," You could buy, you know, three week option, one month option. "
"16592279","16592720"," And if you."
"16593619","16595700"," If you're in the top of the channel, it didn't matter."
"16595820","16596759"," At some point, it was going to print. "
"16597800","16599320"," And, uh, there's just not that much money."
"16599500","16601520"," That I mean, that is true."
"16601939","16605460"," I mean, and like we're just circling right back to ball, right?"
"16605680","16612300"," So, so there are times when I'll look at, say, the XLE or XLI options and I go there 45"
"16612300","16615860"," days and they're a buck and they're, that's 1% of the money. "
"16616040","16617000"," I go like, holy crap."
"16617200","16617540"," That's cheap."
"16618000","16618080"," Right. "
"16618080","16622960"," Because all you need to do, you don't need anything to really happen using a down day."
"16622960","16623980"," And it's doubles."
"16624540","16627340"," So, so, but nobody's really out there. "
"16627619","16630919"," Like, I think the sellers are out there, right?"
"16631200","16634820"," A little longer because like, you know, old guys, you know what they like to do?"
"16634820","16637880"," Sell those culverts and sell those putverts, right?"
"16638200","16639880"," And like, they get newsletters here."
"16640180","16641700"," They're like, sell this and sell that."
"16642040","16644740"," And you look at it and you know, they might get run over. "
"16644919","16649419"," I mean, like half the time I'm being asked to trade out of verticals that are just dead."
"16649919","16651099"," And he's like, is there anything in there?"
"16652360","16655939"," So it's, I don't get sucked into that."
"16656140","16657820"," I'm a, I'm a ball buyer. "
"16658680","16662500"," A lot when things get a little bit ridiculous."
"16662500","16665560"," Like, so, so next week, for example."
"16666740","16669740"," And it was just before Thanksgiving too was a good example. "
"16670099","16673779"," Just before Thanksgiving ball was just getting hammered and there was no point to it."
"16673779","16675200"," So I just started buying puts."
"16676259","16679080"," And then the Monday after Thanksgiving, right?"
"16679439","16680939"," What did the market is minus 60?"
"16681460","16683259"," So, bam, done. "
"16685200","16686180"," You know what I'm saying?"
"16686500","16686779"," Well, yeah."
"16688740","16695660"," I'll try to, I'll try to repeat to the people that I'm talking to all the time about."
"16696480","16698820"," You know, it's like that buying low and selling high. "
"16699099","16705220"," And I'm like, it's not that hard to watch an option chain over time and just watch the ebb and"
"16705220","16705480"," flow."
"16706000","16709860"," And, and you know, like Tasty shows you this, the life of an option you can actually."
"16710240","16710740"," They kind of blow. "
"16710980","16711919"," They kind of blow though."
"16712259","16712970"," They kind of blow though."
"16712970","16714610"," They do what I'm saying. "
"16714830","16718750"," If you look at it, not the life of adoption, you can watch the highs and lows and the decline"
"16718750","16719570"," of it over time."
"16722210","16724490"," And I'm still flabbergasted that."
"16724970","16727130"," Then we're going right back to oversold conditions. "
"16728130","16729890"," They need to have that one trade."
"16730930","16732509"," That they can get in on and know it's going."
"16732730","16735770"," It has a high probability of printing at some point. "
"16737310","16738689"," Yeah, it's selling or buying."
"16738689","16738990"," Right."
"16739290","16746090"," So, so the way I describe the vault service to people is I go, if you, if you think about"
"16746090","16748810"," what you're paying for as a percentage of the underlying. "
"16748830","16753390"," So like when I put a spread on, I'm paying like 25 cents for spy two days."
"16753630","16756390"," I'm literally paying two and a half points of spot, right?"
"16756669","16762029"," So by the time it gets there, the back ends are going to be worth two and a half points,"
"16762029","16762349"," right?"
"16762730","16763250"," Doesn't make any sense."
"16763730","16766230"," So, so you could do that. "
"16767029","16775029"," You could be just just a really good trader and buy longer data options and do very well in this"

"19803370","19810690"," We've actually Estimate what that peak rate will be And today SEP that we're published shows again"

"19911490","19917330"," They're killing both sides right now It's a certain point of the question will become how long do"
"19917330","19919010"," we remain restricted that will become the most?"
"19919110","19920790"," Oh, yeah, that's right That's right. "

"19940350","19941110"," His rates is good."
"19941110","19945830"," Thank you very much Looking at our progress on inflation looking at where financial conditions are"
"19946410","19949870"," And and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. "
"19950110","19955230"," I've told you today We have an assessment that we're not as restrictive enough stance even with"
"19955230","19955830"," today's move."
"19955830","19960210"," Yeah foreign fees are breaking right now Our individual assessments of what we would need to do to"
"19960210","19966050"," get there At a certain point though, then we'll get to that point and then the question will be how"
"19966050","19971750"," long do we stay there and there there are the Strong view on the committee is that when we just"
"19971750","19976390"," stay there, you know until we're really confident That inflation is coming down in a sustained way"
"19976390","19980110"," and we think that that will be some time now Why do I say that if you look at this"
"19980110","19986010"," is kind of like last place for the bear Into three sort of buzzing to hold this right there Goods"
"19986010","19991430"," inflation and we see now as we've been expecting really see we'll see if they do it out I'm not"
"19991430","19996810"," hearing anything that's like doom and gloom that we Bleed off into the clothes or something, but"
"19996810","20000670"," it's not bullish it and maybe goes back But services a little bit and we started it certainly isn't"
"20000670","20006830"," we're not breaking levels right now either In this report in the last one Then you go to housing"
"20006830","20007230"," services."
"20007550","20012230"," We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very very high and will"
"20012230","20020410"," continue to build up actually As great as rents As rents Expire we have to be renewed so it can"
"20020410","20025210"," be renewed into into a market where rates are higher than they were when the Leases were signed,"
"20025590","20029370"," but you see that the new lease is there But the rate for new leases is coming down. "
"20029530","20034710"," So once we work our way through that backlog That that inflation will come down sometime next year"
"20034710","20041670"," the third piece which is something like 55 percent of the index Coronflation index, you know And"
"20041670","20049850"," that's really a function of the labor market largely at the biggest cost by fly in that sector is"
"20049850","20055490"," labor And we do see a very very strong labor market One where we haven't seen much softening where"
"20055490","20059590"," job growth is very high wages are very high I think I got apple at 70 or something like that"
"20059590","20062970"," 74 And really there's an imbalance in the labor market."
"20062990","20069230"," I think I do line demand so that part of it There's there's there's there's likely to take I don't"
"20069230","20071830"," know I don't think they're going to cut it now I think they got to protect you know, I think"
"20071830","20077390"," the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly I don't think that they are Now it seems to be"
"20077390","20078450"," turning that's well."
"20078670","20083150"," That's the thing is that I don't think I think they're trying not to fuck the pensions The uh, sort"
"20083150","20084770"," of looks like they're parking money everywhere. "
"20085010","20087910"," They parked in the bow So where are they going to park it now?"
"20088030","20091950"," They got to hide the money somewhere to get to where we want to go And do they hide it"
"20092580","20101350"," It's high quality bonds That's why that's why assumption is Uh, Howard Shire, it's gorgeous."
"20101670","20108070"," Thanks for taking a question You described a GDP growth in the seps as moderate or modest I believe"
"20108600","20113730"," Um yet, it's really approaching stall speed half a percentage point is not much Uh, you described"
"20113730","20119610"," labor market unemployment rate as representing some softening It's really a full percentage point"
"20119610","20123930"," rise and that's well excessive what Has historically been associated with recession."
"20124330","20127170"," Yeah, I wouldn't just be considered a recession All right, bears. "
"20127270","20128730"," This is your time to shine, man."
"20128870","20133030"," You better get the uh, I don't think I don't want to say to you guys out there Break below"
"20133030","20138730"," here, right I give some hope for the bulls and hope we can bloodbath this down but The expectations"
"20138730","20144810"," in the scp are basically as you said, which is we've got growth At a modest level, which is to"
"20144810","20146130"," say about a half a percentage point."
"20146270","20147830"," Yeah, I I'm watching it, right?"
"20147830","20150330"," I'm I'm looking inside the opt and the state right down. "
"20150470","20154290"," I'm like, they're just vacuuming all this up right now Very so he priced in all of this right now."
"20154290","20160370"," Um In that in that position Labor market conditions are softening a bit unemployment does go up a"
"20160370","20165630"," bit I would say that many analysts believe that the that the natural rate of unemployment is"
"20165630","20167770"," actually Celebrated at this moment."
"20167970","20173510"," So it's not clear that that those forecasts and inflation are really much above the natural rate of"
"20173510","20178610"," unemployment We can never identify its location with great precision But that 3.7 percent. "
"20178650","20180090"," Yeah, I'm still a strong labor market."
"20180110","20184070"," So if you look, you know, you've got the i'm interested I'm very interested right now."
"20184170","20189410"," The track that he's taking with like very reluctant to lay people off I feel like it's something"
"20189410","20194690"," that's in the story Generally companies are holding on to the workers that have because it's been"
"20194690","20198910"," very very hard to hire Yeah, he has to say something to make it go somewhere Why not?"
"20198970","20199630"," I don't know. "
"20199810","20202110"," It's the number employed people That doesn't sound like that."
"20202110","20205350"," I feel like he's trying to be like bulk or light right now And I'm like a lot of people"
"20205350","20207150"," will need to better really want bulk or light."
"20207290","20212770"," I want like hard for a Volcker The labor market can come back into balance with with relatively"
"20212770","20218330"," modest Increase of unemployment we believe none of that is guaranteed, but that that is what their"
"20218330","20228230"," forecast reflects He's hoping I'm praying and"
"20228230","20228930"," get out of this interview. "
"20229270","20235690"," I think it looks like Here's Nick ever a step down the pace of rate increase rate rises Appears to"
"20235690","20241510"," have been socialized at your last meeting largely before The past two cpi reports showed inflation"
"20241510","20247330"," decelerating in line with the committee's forecast this year Yeah, just chase winter is saying"
"20247330","20252650"," somebody has probably feels above about five percent up all time high Does that mean all things"
"20252650","20259970"," equal You would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is By moving in 25 basis"
"20259970","20266290"," point increments including the beginning at your next meeting So I I haven't made a judgment tons"
"20266290","20271870"," math these seeing this rate hike to make it the last meetings But you know what what you said is"
"20271870","20272610"," broadly right?"
"20272870","20275950"," Which is having moved so quickly having so much restraint."
"20276170","20280870"," Oh, oh man They're just catching people right now so bad to move to a slower pace."
"20280890","20286410"," They're just they're just burning burn and burn and That will allow us to feel courting options"
"20286410","20292830"," right now You know and get to that level we think and better balance the risks that we fix so"
"20292830","20295130"," that that's the idea It makes makes a lot of sense. "
"20295310","20301670"," It seems to me He brought up the surrogate but again I can't tell you today what that what the"
"20301670","20306970"," actual size of that will be it will depend on on a variety of factors including like cute cute Nick"
"20306970","20319930"," over in the corner state of the economy state of financial conditions If"
"20319930","20323450"," they got it If they got it to pin if they got it to pin right in the close of"
"20323450","20329810"," the opening price So as I'll laugh my ass down or practice the SEP reflects any data that's that"
"20329810","20334790"," comes out during the meeting and participants know that they have the They know this that they they"
"20334790","20340630"," can make changes to their SEP during the meeting They're just Matthew you watching this right bro."
"20340810","20343890"," They're just they're just portion options right now That's not the case."
"20344050","20349450"," It's never the case that that the SEP's don't reflect An important piece of data that came in on"
"20349450","20358610"," the first day of the meeting I I kind of do Hi chair pal yeah Siegel from the watching time"
"20358610","20362810"," thank you for taking our questions I'm wondering if we could talk about the projection for the"
"20362810","20368270"," unemployment rate Why has the Fed raised it's unemployment projection Is it because the model"
"20368270","20372710"," suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment rate Or are"
"20372710","20377010"," you seeing signs that the labor market isn't quite as strong as we think it is now No, it's not"
"20377010","20378230"," about the strength of the labor market. "
"20378290","20382810"," The labor market is is clearly very strong I think I've heard this story that um, but I don't"
"20382810","20387730"," remember the story Tell it we had expected to continually expect it to make faster progress on"
"20387730","20394230"," inflation than than we have Ultimately, and that's why the that's why the uh, the peak rate for"
"20394230","20399010"," this year goes up Do they there this meeting and this there's there's no heavy selling here."
"20399010","20402970"," It's like it's almost half a half It's not so that's why that goes up."
"20403190","20409590"," This looks like they're jumping great This looks like rotation Under the cover of doom and gloom in"
"20409590","20409910"," the media. "
"20410150","20416070"," I think but but that's that's the idea is slower progress on inflation Tighter policy probably"
"20416070","20423810"," higher rates probably held for longer Just to just to get to where you kind of restriction that you"
"20423810","20424350"," need to get inflation."
"20424350","20428110"," Well, so on sunday on sunday I posted to them."
"20428210","20435050"," I said I don't care what happens at cpa it's coming straight back down or up to uh To the"
"20435050","20439230"," like revision right back to what's where we were it doesn't matter what they say You know, they're"
"20439230","20442110"," you can look at they can look at history They're bringing it right back when they did they brought"
"20442110","20442570"," it right back. "
"20442690","20448690"," So it was like the by end of day It bounced up uh 400 or something That's why they just"
"20448690","20451110"," expect to bounce there They did it bounced right there."
"20451110","20452170"," Why do we think that is the case?"
"20452410","20456750"," So I'll give you a soul grant Yeah, so so started selling back down right at the opening bell hang"
"20456750","20466450"," of vacancies They don't want to lay people off So that they'll keep people because"
"20466450","20471610"," it's been so hard and I think we've it feels like we have a structural Labor shortage out there"
"20471610","20476130"," where they're you know 4 million fewer people a little more than 4 million Who are in the workforce"
"20476130","20481570"," available to work then there's demand to work for so the fact that it's a strong labor market You"
