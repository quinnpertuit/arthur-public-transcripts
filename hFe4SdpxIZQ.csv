"47900","50120"," A little behind this morning."
"50240","51540"," I think everybody's hung over this morning."
"52560","53260"," I think so. "
"53620","54340"," Not sure about that."
"55540","57000"," Switch over to an intro here."
"68530","69850"," Just a second here. "
"71150","77890"," What are we doing here?"
"78090","79070"," I gotta do this other thing."
"79070","79350"," Here."
"79610","80330"," Good morning, everybody. "
"80630","80950"," Good morning."
"81090","81350"," Good morning."

"100750","101010"," Good morning."
"101170","101950"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"102750","103890"," I'll tell you what I'm a little."
"104610","106030"," I think the whole market even fit into it. "
"106130","108330"," This morning's a little hung over."
"108330","110150"," It wasn't."
"110510","111290"," Let me see here. "
"111370","112530"," I'm gonna switch right over."
"112630","113710"," Turn this right into the mainstream here."
"113790","114910"," I'm a little late this morning myself. "
"117540","118380"," Good morning, everybody."
"118820","119540"," How's everybody doing?"
"120740","121460"," Who's out there?"
"121660","122380"," Good morning, kid time."
"123020","123960"," Morning, Jay Cortina. "
"124340","124900"," Morning, Dylan."
"124900","126280"," Morning, yellow, good morning, Otis."
"126800","127380"," Jay Money, Pink. "
"128039","128759"," Big, good to see you."
"128960","130100"," Good kid time, Dean."
"130920","131320"," Mahesh. "
"131720","131720"," John."
"132180","132420"," Stop out."
"132540","133400"," Read those in the house. "
"134020","134020"," RS."
"134440","135260"," Winky face, my brother."
"137640","138480"," Good morning, brother. "
"139220","140940"," Winky is trying to tell everybody's good."
"140960","142180"," Getting off Twitter this morning."
"142180","143080"," I don't want them to get off Twitter. "
"143200","144040"," I'm kind of pissed about it."
"144060","145480"," I'm having a bad morning just seeing that shit."
"146460","147320"," Good morning, Matthew. "
"147460","148040"," Good morning, Otis."
"148120","150420"," Good morning, Matthew as well."
"150900","151900"," Matthew in Matthew Phillip, H."
"152000","157660"," Bomb, Devin, Binky, S.O.S., CSM, Jazz, Kato, Mike. "
"157840","158920"," Oh, a bunch of people in here this morning."
"159040","159560"," Good morning, everybody."
"162060","167780"," Yeah, I figured as much, I know you're a busy man, so I'm missing on you right now. "
"167780","168800"," I'm missing on you right now."
"168960","169480"," I seriously am."
"169480","171700"," So hopefully I can catch back up with you. "
"171780","172500"," Good morning, Chas."
"172620","172880"," How are you?"
"172940","173800"," Chances in the house."
"174020","179080"," Brad, Justin, Thomas, Chance here, Binky, Kato, Elite, 1987, Crucen. "
"179720","181480"," Everybody's in the house showing up every morning, right?"
"182040","183000"," Rohit, Dave, G."
"183620","186460"," They get a little thing down here saying that I'll be away today."
"187840","190800"," I might be away part of the day today, so I just wanted to put that up there just in"
"190800","191000"," case."
"192660","195020"," We're going to talk about some stuff real quick before we get into it, okay?"
"196260","198300"," We want to look at some stuff before the market opens. "
"198300","199740"," I haven't changed the levels yet."
"199800","200880"," I put the levels out this morning."
"201340","204020"," I haven't had a chance yet to update the levels. "
"204020","205300"," So we'll do the levels together today."
"206180","208260"," There is something important this morning you want to be watching, right?"
"209140","211660"," Kind of getting a gap up here off the bell."
"214120","217420"," And we're also, you can see that we're in positive gamma, okay?"
"217700","220300"," So there's a few things going on. "
"220300","222240"," I tried to make it simply yesterday."
"222240","227500"," I was like, there's a think about a yacht being out in the middle of nowhere and they're paying $10 "
"227500","235780",",000 a minute to watch CNBC on some shitty satellite dish news service and they hear pivot."
"236800","238260"," They haven't heard pivot all year long. "
"238520","243900"," So calling up their broker and they're saying, you know, I've got trillions, you know, or a"
"243900","246800"," trillion dollars that I'm going to throw 20 billion."
"246800","251420"," Because I see Bert should have been hosted by the KBWC just in case, right?"
"251540","252280"," I'm going to buy this bottom."
"252280","257720"," And so you're going to see this melt up, very soft melt up yesterday in the market. "
"258120","262040"," And we're also in positive gamut, a good game of flip going on."
"262240","266520"," So markets are going to be supportive until we encounter some resistance."
"267480","268000"," Does it make sense?"
"269080","271340"," So you'll be buying dips when they come out. "
"271620","273500"," When there's a dip, you should be buying it."
"274100","275560"," You shouldn't be selling rips right now."
"277300","278360"," Conscience of that, okay?"
"278620","282880"," Now there are gamma levels with this pivots, like we're talking every day, there's pivots, trade"
"282880","283520"," down below there. "
"283700","285000"," Yeah, we can start selling rips."
"286220","286280"," Right?"
"287400","289400"," Be conscious of that as we open up this morning."
"290320","292580"," I want you to see something here in a larger time frame, okay?"
"294680","296580"," We're going to go to a three month chart here. "
"296760","298060"," I just haven't cleaned this up from yesterday."
"300160","302760"," You can see, I think everybody knows that we're above."
"305240","308120"," We're now above the channel, rightfully so, right?"
"308340","311920"," So if we do have a trend change, there's a couple things. "
"312720","313460"," There's a couple things."
"313780","315820"," This is the first good news we've had all year long."
"317260","320520"," If we had that good news down below here, we would have taken off, right?"
"320520","324020"," We never get good news at the top of a channel, ever. "
"324760","325860"," All year, never once."
"327620","329680"," So sometimes we come above that channel, right?"
"330240","333020"," Here's the, you can start it right here if you want."
"334460","335220"," Right to the peak. "
"335340","336900"," See how we sell it right there?"
"337080","337400"," Oh, hold on."
"340750","341990"," Sold it back here, right?"
"342230","342970"," Sold it right over here."
"344390","346750"," I'm going to explain this better to you here in just a moment. "
"347310","348590"," Sold it right here, right?"
"350130","352990"," We've never had a reason to break out of this down channel."
"353590","357590"," So you have to think about this from the perspective of these algorithms."
"358450","363410"," These algorithms are going to seek out where resistance is support is, right?"
"363930","365610"," So these algorithms are going to jump on up. "
"366050","367750"," We're going to trade all the way up to resistance."
"368790","373770"," If that's real resistance, we'll trade back down until we find some support keywords there."
"374370","376050"," Until we find some support, right?"
"376950","378770"," If there's no support, we continue down. "
"379430","384230"," If we finally find support, then I'm going to trade up until we find real resistance."
"386950","390850"," And so we know that everyone wants to sell this or has all year long."
"391870","396910"," We get an untimely J-POW, right?"
"397270","401270"," Unexpected J-POW yesterday saying no, we'll go into that later, but. "
"402390","408050"," So what you're going to have to expect is that when we open today, we're going to go higher and"
"408050","411010"," see if there's resistance still at the top of this channel."
"412270","416950"," If we don't encounter that resistance here at the top of this channel, and you can see we've broken"
"416950","422170"," above now, what you'll find is we should have a supportive market."
"422330","427870"," And that's a supportive market, what it should do is it should at least at a minimum consolidate"
"427870","437830"," here and wait to see if buyers step in here and want to drive it up further to"
"437830","440970"," the first natural point of resistance, or there's a few of them. "
"442670","447190"," And when I look at those right now, we know we've got a few, right?"
"447370","448330"," We know we've got right up here."
"449690","452810"," You can see right up right here where we are here."
"455480","457400"," So we started to sell the market down, right?"
"458300","459980"," We knew we had sellers back here. "
"460060","460780"," We'll show you a few places."
"462100","464880"," We knew the sellers came back in the market over here, right?"
"466580","468800"," We also know some sellers came in over here."
"470580","473900"," And you can't see it, so I'm going to move this over for a minute. "
"478530","479710"," Clear out, clean all this up."
"480190","481910"," You had some sellers that came in here, right?"
"482050","486830"," So we're going to put a natural line there for 414.84. You've got a small gap right here."
"488970","490490"," Right, so we'll snap a line there. "
"490670","491890"," And we had more sellers back here."
"492130","493110"," Now there's some other keys here."
"493630","496630"," See where these sellers came in over here and started selling it down?"
"497430","498790"," We already got this line here, right?"
"499590","500150"," We're going to lay across. "
"500310","501250"," We're going to snap some lines here."
"504180","506460"," Then we're going to start slamming in some targets, right?"
"506660","507420"," We're going to slam in."
"507520","508400"," We've got one right here. "
"508560","511159"," We know that we've had some firm resistance there."
"511880","512880"," We know where that line is."
"513020","513820"," We've got another one right here. "
"514220","514940"," Pop one in there."
"517590","521130"," We've got this gap to fill above."
"522830","524210"," Right, so we've got some upper targets. "
"525410","527550"," We've got a supportive market."
"528050","530090"," We have range expansion as well, right?"
"530510","532310"," Do you notice the levels that I put up this morning?"
"532930","533670"," They're huge."
"534670","536730"," There's some huge moves that we made in here. "
"538450","541250"," And so what I'm going to expect on the open today is some consolidation."
"541570","542970"," I'm going to expect it maybe for three days."
"543190","543910"," It could take three days. "
"545230","547690"," But I believe they're going to be supportive at this point."
"547730","548990"," I don't think they're going to have an immediate rollover."
"550450","555210"," Oh, before what Jay Pao said yesterday, I would have said, I got my chance. "
"555870","557950"," I now have my chance, put some put spreads on."
"558710","562290"," I can throw them on here for the three months out on them."
"563030","564150"," And they'll probably print. "
"565990","568430"," I posted a tweet from a timestamp."
"568870","572570"," I went back through last night and watched all the fucking broadcast that we had yesterday."
"573950","579070"," And I posted exactly earlier in the day, I gave you three or four options as to what could happen. "
"579290","583550"," And this was the option that happened yesterday, what he did say yesterday, we went straight up."
"583850","586720"," And what would the expectation be if we do go straight up?"
"590010","592430"," That expectation is going to be a week."
"592530","595450"," We'll talk about PE ratios for the S&P 500. "
"595810","596170"," We're going to."
"596170","598590"," You know, when you're looking at."
"599790","605270"," This is a moving target on on on on on on PE ratios for the S&P 500. "
"605370","612390"," If if economic conditions changes next year and they're laying people off, we will be under our PE."
"613690","617050"," Expectations and not this this this ER season."
"617930","623390"," We didn't really or the the analysts were right more frequently. "
"623390","624290"," They have been the past."
"624290","628750"," I think we only had a 65% beat this year, but or this eat this season."
"629770","632410"," But there'll be a fair chance that they're they'll be wrong again. "
"632510","637050"," They're normally if you look at most ER seasons, the analysts are wrong, like 75% of the time."
"638270","642110"," And there's a real possibility that they could be very wrong coming into this year, this upcoming"
"642110","642510"," year."
"643910","647370"," Where they're saying, you know, we're expecting a decline and then all of a sudden inflation comes"
"647370","649430"," down price controls come down shortages come down. "
"651390","657290"," We end up beating GDP expectations and you find a huge chasm here and to this upcoming year."
"659270","662550"," So because I heard that argument as well, and I was like, God, it's moving target for this year"
"662550","664130"," easily, easily."
"665930","668030"," So anyways, you've got these you got these numbers here, right?"
"668550","669970"," They're going to take a chance at it. "
"670250","675030"," If you haven't had a good reason to go up or break this channel even for a minute, you got"
"675030","675650"," it yesterday."
"676950","681190"," So the whole argument that we're going to roll this market over to the depths of hell today,"
"681190","682270"," probably not correct."
"683610","685470"," You're probably looking for some consolidation up here. "
"687050","691570"," And a continuation of this of this move this up here."
"695860","700780"," Some cut some kind of a continuation rate consolidation continuation up higher and start at least"
"700780","702040"," checking these levels above."
"702760","707620"," And the market's going to want to check these levels trade this up here until it meets some"
"707620","710360"," resistance comes back down and finds out. "
"710540","715680"," So you get the idea here is that you consolidate you trade up until you're told no."
"716540","721320"," And then we'll come back down right and then come back and recheck if we're actually heading lower"
"721320","721720"," down here."
"722480","723780"," So trade the levels. "
"724020","725580"," I posted that this morning trade the level."
"725580","731180"," I posted levels and I said to last night, I think trade each level, no matter what every single"
"731180","733020"," time, no matter how you're feeling."
"733740","734700"," You can be feeling bullish. "
"734900","736020"," You can be feeling bearish."
"736040","736840"," It doesn't matter what you feel."
"737320","739240"," It matters how you trade this market, right?"
"739520","743440"," It matters that you can shift with this market, trade this market, go level level, no matter what. "
"744740","746200"," No matter what your biases are."
"746880","750720"," Even yesterday in stream, I was going back in the video and I even told you guys yesterday I said"
"750720","750960"," this."
"751080","752020"," Why do you feel so bearish?"
"752800","753860"," And I said I'll never lie to you. "
"753860","756840"," I always want to be honest with you as to how I'm feeling inside."
"757160","757620"," I'm trading."
"757620","758500"," You guys knew I had calls. "
"759140","761920"," You knew I wanted to sell those calls that red bar."
"762020","762580"," We slapped it."
"763420","765340"," And I wanted to sell the market at that point. "
"765560","767100"," And we were listening live to J-POW."
"767480","768060"," And it turned off."
"768680","773560"," And it turned off the news yesterday of the news stream because no one had caught on that we had"
"773560","774260"," a policy shift. "
"774260","778580"," Or at least that was the implication about three minutes in a J-POW's conversation."
"780080","781420"," And you have to be able to dissect."
"783060","786900"," What these speakers or events are saying, what the implications are. "
"787100","788600"," That's what I posted last night."
"788820","790280"," Hey, if we hear this, expect this."
"790440","791800"," If you hear that, expect that. "
"793520","798340"," Someone else yesterday asked me why I wasn't longing Tesla before the news."
"798720","800020"," And I explained why yesterday, right?"
"800400","802460"," You don't know if it's going up or if it's going down."
"802620","805120"," You might get it right once or three times out of 10. "
"805120","810380"," If you want to stay in this game, you wait for that break of the news or whatever event."
"811300","812460"," And you trade the reaction."
"813960","814460"," Always. "
"815040","822280"," I assure you that those people come and they go, don't ever look towards those people that are"
"822280","823660"," like, well, I picked it right this time."
"825380","827320"," And, you know, I'm the greatest ever."
"827540","833980"," You always want to be open to change because I've smoked accounts doing that shit. "
"834900","835860"," I've smoked them."
"836800","837580"," Don't ever do that."
"837880","839460"," Anyways, rant over. "
"841420","843400"," So we've got some upper targets here."
"843540","848600"," We're going to take a look at the levels and we're going to plug some levels in for the day."
"850060","854480"," We'll do this together today so we can actually, if you guys are doing this at home or a desk"
"854480","859740"," at work, or something, we'll start taking some looks higher. "
"859740","860100"," Okay."
"861640","862900"," And see where we're headed."
"864140","865600"," Get rid of this gap over here. "
"866700","869480"," I'm going to put up the book map for you so you can see it."
"870740","871440"," Hold on a minute."
"871660","873940"," Let's do some work on the book map first for you. "
"876080","878060"," We have some sellers right now, just so you know."
"890510","893030"," We have some upper targets, 4, 1, 5, 0."
"895150","897890"," We've got some lower targets right, 4, 0, 4, 5."
"900090","902970"," Let me bring this over so you can see what I'm doing over here for work."
"906860","907940"," Let me just take it here. "
"919440","922840"," All right."
"922920","923420"," Your pivot point."
"923720","925140"," Let me see if we can get this together. "
"926320","926840"," Bring some of this up."
"935240","936600"," Amazing day yesterday, right?"
"936720","937680"," It was a pretty wild day."
"938040","943820"," We also had another neat part about yesterday was at one point we had hundreds of people watching. "
"947160","949560"," And hundreds, we were in the thousands at one point."
"949980","953220"," And as soon as we thought the day was over, I was like, you know what, I'm going to leave"
"953220","954500"," some calls on the end and walk away."
"955400","956820"," I'll be back with you guys at the end, right?"
"957140","959700"," And then I ended up staying on live yesterday. "
"960060","971710"," And what we did was we had a 40295 right there."
"971850","972230"," There's your pivot."
"974750","975730"," Can you believe that?"
"976090","976530"," 40295?"
"979650","981210"," This is the pivot point right here. "
"981210","982150"," Look at how low that is."
"983550","983990"," Crazy."
"985890","987290"," Crazy where that pivot is. "
"988950","990890"," The market kept going up right to the end."
"991430","998390"," There was at least three or four opportunities to just enter a call position and just diamond hand"
"998390","999210"," them right into the bell."
"1000230","1003710"," And they just kept grinding up and just grinding up and grinding up. "
"1004870","1008530"," 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500% right into the bell yesterday."
"1009110","1009530"," It was insane."
"1010910","1014730"," And for all those that stayed yesterday, there's no reason you didn't make money going to that bell"
"1014730","1015070"," yesterday. "
"1017290","1020890"," A pivot point today on the supply of 40295, right?"
"1022230","1023730"," We got a R1 as 412."
"1028310","1029190"," Oh, shit."
"1029890","1030530"," Look at that. "
"1031450","1031890"," 41241."
"1035230","1036130"," That's our one."
"1037750","1038810"," Is that not wild?"
"1039010","1039310"," You see that?"
"1039450","1040930"," How big of a move that would be?"
"1045200","1046960"," Wait till you see where R2 is. "
"1048440","1049240"," And R3."
"1049660","1051140"," You're not going to believe this, right?"
"1052200","1055380"," So R2 is 417."
"1058200","1058960"," Right here. "
"1063850","1066190"," 15 and you're probably going to be like, there's no wake up."
"1067730","1068610"," Here's R2."
"1070450","1071170"," And then ready?"
"1072310","1072790"," 42661. "
"1073030","1074430"," You're going to be like, nah, I have no way."
"1075990","1078510"," I knew this range expansion was going to be insane."
"1087190","1087690"," 42661. "
"1095080","1096380"," How's that for an R3?"
"1098640","1099740"," Look at that real quick."
"1104150","1105070"," It's giant."
"1107210","1108150"," Hold on a second here. "
"1108230","1108550"," Give me a second."
"1110730","1113670"," It's huge, huge moves."
"1115210","1115450"," Right?"
"1115610","1119550"," I don't think we'd go there today, but it's amazing. "
"1119550","1123830"," Just the range expansion that's possible with that move yesterday."
"1126470","1127750"," We've got the channel here."
"1127990","1130110"," Let me mute a book map here for you. "
"1130830","1131510"," Hold on."
"1133390","1133910"," Almost."
"1138210","1139370"," Starting to trade below. "
"1140310","1142650"," Watch this yellow channel right here."
"1143570","1145550"," Keep your eyes on this yellow channel right."
"1145550","1148310"," To the points down below is the point of control basically, right?"
"1152120","1156060"," We've got support number one is 39828. "
"1159610","1160850"," We'll kick all these down."
"1167940","1173280"," I made a post and I said to the people, I said, I made a post like two days ago."
"1173920","1175740"," I think it was on Tuesday or something. "
"1176600","1178440"," And I said, wait, get ready for some range expansion."
"1180200","1181000"," You got it."
"1181140","1181960"," We got range expansion. "
"1183040","1184780"," There's S1 right here."
"1193130","1195730"," No need to even put retracement in Dewey."
"1200580","1203000"," S2 moves from these down here. "
"1214910","1237000"," 388.75. 398 "
"1237000","1244060",".388.384. And say, talk about range expansion."
"1253940","1254680"," Hold on here."
"1258960","1259400"," S33401. "
"1263980","1265040"," Way down here."
"1268340","1269560"," Look at how big that is."
"1273880","1275260"," Take a look at that live on stream. "
"1276740","1278620"," It's kind of crazy over here, right?"
"1278780","1279440"," A lot going on."
"1284440","1286260"," So what are my expectations going to be?"
"1286260","1287420"," Probably you're probably asking, right?"
"1287580","1288640"," So we'll look at book map right here."
"1290920","1292000"," You can see sellers. "
"1293260","1294400"," We'll slide over to the book map."
"1296580","1298260"," So I got to get rid of that Papa J-Pow."
"1300320","1302040"," You got to get rid of that one on the ticker. "
"1311210","1312850"," So you can see some sellers coming to the market."
"1313010","1314550"," Market is still supportive, still strong."
"1326320","1327700"," So we're going to take a look right here, right?"
"1327820","1329700"," We know that we've got some supply here. "
"1329700","1341690"," So we'll put some, put a"
"1341690","1342690"," little red there for the bears."
"1343030","1343770"," Keep the bears happy."
"1350310","1351930"," We've got it on a smaller time frame. "
"1356520","1358080"," About a five minute chart now."
"1372800","1375960"," Now I'll tell you what, we've got some fucking buyers sitting right here."
"1377720","1378200"," Unreal. "
"1379740","1380940"," So what would my expectations be?"
"1380940","1388580"," My expectations would be that we probably break here and try to find some support at 403 at the"
"1388580","1389000"," pivot point."
"1389740","1393360"," I'd like to see no more than a breakdown to the pivot point."
"1393540","1398520"," Maybe possible down to S1, consolidate, and then the move higher. "
"1399240","1400740"," Probably going to take a few days of consolidation."
"1401320","1403540"," I'm going to give it like, let's give it to like the third of December."
"1405800","1413260"," So maybe today, tomorrow into Monday, that's what I'm going to hope for. "
"1413480","1416840"," So we get some consolidation and then get the strength to move higher."
"1418380","1422560"," That's going to be the hope from, at least from my side, which is why I think it's going to"
"1422560","1423020"," happen today."
"1427440","1428760"," Got a little gap down here. "
"1440880","1442220"," But I would not be selling the repair."
"1442220","1445080"," I guess that would be my point is that I would not sell the repair."
"1447680","1452000"," If you want to take a put spread on a smaller timeframe, man, I don't know. "
"1452300","1453500"," I'd put some time on it a month."
"1455640","1457720"," They're going to try to slam it higher."
"1461020","1462240"," I think the game changed. "
"1463400","1465260"," Have all of you guys seen meltups before?"
"1467580","1472620"," And if there's the end, if there's something broken in the system, you're probably not going to see"
"1472620","1477800"," that rollover until they make an attempt higher."
"1478040","1478460"," You'll see it."
"1478520","1479160"," You'll see an attack. "
"1479360","1481240"," You're going to no matter what you're going to see an attack higher."
"1481560","1487220"," There hasn't been a reason at all this year to even come out of friend down trend."
"1488060","1491160"," Yesterday was the first time, first reason. "
"1491160","1494120"," We had the bingo card brief and that stuff, right?"
"1494240","1498260"," We had Ukraine war, cessation of hostilities."
"1499380","1501220"," Probably put 300 points on the board."
"1501480","1502160"," No problem. "
"1504510","1505330"," No problem."
"1506150","1511630"," If you had some kind of like a Reagan-esque type populist president that was like, don't worry,"
"1511770","1515730"," we're going to fix everything and, you know, pump up Ponzi's game."
"1516170","1516630"," That would do it. "
"1518570","1520530"," Tonal shift in the Fed."
"1520830","1521330"," That would do it."
"1522730","1524130"," Because they'll, they'll front run it, right?"
"1524290","1526430"," Into the, into the, before, before we actually have a."
"1528110","1530830"," A reasonable, that doesn't mean we're going to have a reasonable economy. "
"1531050","1532470"," We're going to talk about that as well today."
"1532630","1535450"," We have a big, a big, some big stuff to talk about this morning."
"1537170","1539330"," And that would be, when do you short this?"
"1540970","1542430"," How do you know when to short this?"
"1543990","1546830"," You're going to see a ramp, more than likely you'll see a ramp. "
"1548330","1550670"," That takes place between now and springtime."
"1552750","1557930"," And in this ramp, you're going to see the market will roll over and down."
"1558110","1559870"," We're going to sell the minutes, basically. "
"1560830","1561950"," So where they'll have a meeting."
"1563430","1564630"," They'll ramp into the meeting."
"1567150","1569250"," Trying to front run any kind of a change. "
"1570530","1574330"," And then they're going to sell into the minutes, more than likely they'll sell into the minutes."
"1575130","1578150"," To find out the truth in case they're, they're lying to us."
"1579830","1583370"," And they'll ramp into the next few Fed meetings. "
"1586410","1587730"," You can actually time them."
"1587850","1589310"," I haven't, I haven't done the chart yet, but."
"1590210","1593310"," I'll show you in previous cycles when we've made the shift. "
"1594150","1599950"," Where the meetings were, where the minutes were, and how the market reacted, leading up to, and"
"1599950","1600750"," then down afterwards."
"1602250","1607690"," And what they'll do is they'll, if the plan would be, I would assume by big money in the background"
"1607690","1611650"," is going to be our bank money in the background is that they're going to pause and wait, pause and"
"1611650","1616810"," we'll pump and wait, and see all the way through into next year and be ahead of."
"1621050","1626990"," Supposedly our economy becoming stronger into the, into 2023, 2024 2025. "
"1642300","1646640"," Hold on here."
"1655730","1656730"," So you guys are doing."
"1659330","1661810"," More Mr unrealized gains, more in derivative yield. "
"1666890","1668030"," Yeah, be unbiased."
"1672360","1673920"," Somehow saying they're a trained days."
"1674160","1675820"," I'm going to warn any of you out there right now. "
"1675900","1676000"," Okay."
"1677940","1679320"," They will not use."
"1681000","1683940"," That that news yesterday is bigger than. "
"1684780","1687240"," I mean, unless they find a reason to use them."
"1687240","1694560"," And a small, not the PC is a small news event or CPI, but that total shift yesterday will get"
"1694560","1702640"," front run until you get minutes for a statement from the fed that changes as they're going to try"
"1702640","1706100"," to front run this and I promise you that will be the plan."
"1706100","1709860"," And I can show you instances of it in the past when it when it happens. "
"1710080","1710720"," It's wild."
"1711360","1716480"," So you look for your biggest rollovers more than likely at the release of the minutes at the"
"1716480","1718740"," minutes of each meeting in the next few months."
"1719860","1721880"," You see the most weakness in the market. "
"1722280","1723600"," We'll show that with data from the past."
"1724320","1724880"," How that happens."
"1731400","1731760"," Yeah. "
"1731900","1737660"," FMC is going to assume they're going to ramp into FMC and then they're going to sell into FMC"
"1737660","1739840"," minutes because you get the truth in them."
"1740320","1742340"," You get the truth in the fed speakers in the in the minutes."
"1742460","1743540"," No matter what they're saying publicly. "
"1753230","1754830"," I'm going to take a look at GDX this morning."
"1761030","1761830"," Front run what?"
"1762310","1765570"," Let me do a poll right now and find out."
"1765690","1768350"," I want to be I want to find out people that are watching this right now. "
"1770090","1773370"," You know, I was talking about this yesterday briefly with a friend."
"1773990","1780070"," I remember one of the biggest ones I've ever seen was in the 2020 crash."
"1781770","1783910"," We were on those Wall Street bets then. "
"1787830","1791870"," And I remember when the Fed signaled a policy shift."
"1794130","1795330"," We were heading down."
"1796430","1797290"," We spiked up. "
"1798210","1799150"," We rolled over."
"1802880","1806020"," When we when we rolled over right, we immediately reversed."
"1807080","1808220"," And it was it was off the races. "
"1810720","1812220"," One warning for you."
"1815080","1818780"," Is we we were making so much money on puts."
"1820440","1822640"," That if you hadn't started at the beginning. "
"1823500","1827280"," When the market rolled over, you couldn't actually buy into anything."
"1828480","1831340"," Without 20, 30, 40, $5,000."
"1831840","1835420"," Like you needed some real weight to continue to make some bank. "
"1835900","1836000"," Okay."
"1837220","1839140"," I got a warning for you."
"1839140","1841060"," I watched guys give back. "
"1842120","1843560"," A million dollars."
"1844200","1845480"," You guys don't believe that."
"1845620","1847440"," I want to do a poll right now. "
"1848160","1850900"," I want to know how many of you how long you guys have been trading."
"1852880","1854380"," And I want you to think about that."
"1859460","1864080"," This isn't the right or wrong or nothing, but I want to ask this question. "
"1872340","1876140"," I think it's the reason I think it's important is because I think you've had time and market."
"1883470","1886430"," I think you've seen how quiet Ben Twitt is."
"1888710","1891510"," I think it's because there's a lot of guys with a lot of time and market. "
"1892830","1896310"," That are not necessarily saying we're going up and we're going to have this huge melt up."
"1898030","1906270"," But I think there are guys out there that have been a market long enough that are like, oh, fuck."
"1909990","1911270"," Is this the ship?"
"1913670","1914970"," So there's like a moment for pause. "
"1915610","1916570"," Here's a here's my question."
"1916630","1917510"," I'm going to put it in right now."
"1919610","1921090"," There's no right or wrong answer to this. "
"1921090","1927030"," Just be honest in your answer so that everybody can get a fair idea of how long you've been in"
"1927030","1927310"," market."
"1927590","1933930"," I think if you've been in market for a long time, you're at least you're really shaken by what was"
"1933930","1934630"," said yesterday."
"1937370","1943830"," When they talk about the Ponzi scheme, when they talk about a shift, you know, any of you that were"
"1943830","1944990"," even trading before 2020. "
"1947250","1948490"," Remember, you know what I did?"
"1948890","1949770"," I remember the bottom, right?"
"1949770","1956590"," I remember the talk was there's no fucking way the market's turning around, even with with the"
"1956590","1959090"," money printer turned on."
"1959270","1960250"," Remember, I was watching."
"1960910","1964190"," I actually watched that 2020 interview with Jerome. "
"1965170","1966790"," It was a Sunday night."
"1966930","1967570"," Yeah, Sunday night."
"1967690","1970390"," I remember that fucking that interview and I was like, oh, fuck. "
"1970950","1976310"," And what's crazier is there was even discussions of, well, the S&P 500 will go up."
"1976390","1978150"," There's no way small caps is going up."
"1978150","1979470"," That was the big one. "
"1979890","1984270"," Small caps is not going up because all these small and medium sized businesses are closed."
"1985070","1987790"," It wound up being the biggest mover."
"1989370","1992490"," No, that was the one index that everybody said. "
"1992710","1994230"," There's no fucking way that one's going up."
"1995470","1997810"," That shit's going to fucking sideways and bleed."
"1998110","1999010"," No way it's going up. "
"1999590","2000690"," And they Ponzi schemed it."
"2001910","2006330"," So it doesn't mean, you know, whenever, especially when you're like, there's no way this is"
"2006330","2006650"," happening."
"2007770","2008750"," That's what it happens. "
"2016140","2019720"," That's what it happens is when you're like the least probable time."
"2021900","2023680"," So just be conscious of that."
"2025320","2027180"," Always be open to that idea. "
"2027920","2030200"," You can be positioned short here."
"2030860","2032580"," I've got a, I still have a down short."
"2032740","2037260"," I haven't got triple, not a short, but I got a long put triple leverage puts on the Dow. "
"2039500","2041540"," That I'm totally fucked on."
"2044320","2045100"," For March."
"2045500","2049860"," So I don't know, you know, I don't know if that's just going to get torched and burn and never"
"2049860","2051199"," ever come back, probably, but. "
"2054480","2058280"," Just be open to this crazy melt up is my point."
"2059940","2064260"," I do not believe for a second that the money that came into the market yesterday."
"2064260","2066800"," I was just short covering. "
"2067420","2069659"," You saw the volume yesterday come into the market."
"2070500","2071600"," Most people trying to."
"2072659","2072980"," One second. "
"2076860","2077980"," This really weird."
"2080900","2082719"," Really weird thing going on."
"2086199","2087679"," I'll give you guys a talking about. "
"2098580","2101180"," Yeah, more than suggesting that QT could be over."
"2101420","2106460"," So there, there are data sets that show money supply data sets that show that."
"2107260","2109660"," The Fed not only could be. "
"2110840","2111860"," So here's the idea."
"2111960","2112460"," The idea would be."
"2114640","2117700"," I was talking to someone last night about us trying to explain that. "
"2117700","2118820"," They warehouse."
"2119200","2121740"," They warehouse shit to to teach it."
"2122280","2122940"," So you. "
"2123220","2124580"," Let me make this simple."
"2124580","2125840"," So let's say I say to you."
"2125920","2126180"," Let's say I'm. "
"2126380","2126980"," You get."
"2127160","2131120"," I think Jenny Marcus at one point posted a link a few months ago."
"2132380","2136260"," About the mechanics of how the Fed was was conducting QT. "
"2138600","2144200"," And then I'm like simply saying would be like this would be like, okay, I'm going to take some"
"2144200","2145440"," money out of the market right now."
"2145500","2145820"," Right."
"2146440","2149480"," And try to and try to sell some some of our assets. "
"2152620","2153020"," And."
"2154260","2159220"," If the market can't take it right there we're housing it to the side for like a later generation to"
"2159220","2159740"," deal with."
"2159980","2161860"," Although in the books it shows that it's gone. "
"2163480","2167020"," So when you look at money supply right now, it's starting to level off."
"2171840","2174500"," When you start to look when you start to look at QT."
"2179880","2180920"," Shortages inflation. "
"2182280","2184460"," There there's a year lag in that stuff."
"2185140","2188080"," When you start to look around you see that jobs are still strong."
"2188720","2192920"," When you start to look around you're you're seeing that companies haven't folded FTX full of it. "
"2193140","2196200"," So there's all these things are like we're going to start seeing."
"2197420","2198500"," We're going to start seeing."
"2199000","2201260"," There's a potential of inflation coming down. "
"2202040","2207960"," In the next year or two year or two."
"2208700","2211080"," Acceptance of higher prices."
"2211800","2213240"," When we reprice things. "
"2214700","2216500"," That's sometimes how inflation goes away."
"2217520","2221780"," See like a guy that sells eggs and he's only able to raise the price of eggs every decade or"
"2221780","2222040"," so."
"2222740","2224040"," And you start to accept it. "
"2224240","2225800"," And that's how inflation actually goes away."
"2239070","2240610"," I have a bunch of data for you guys."
"2240910","2244110"," If I have some time today I'm going to try to step away for a minute and start posting stuff"
"2244110","2245370"," for you guys to look at. "
"2249590","2251930"," So yeah, am I suggesting that QT is ending?"
"2252170","2254430"," Yes, I'm suggesting that it's going to end."
"2255910","2256670"," Or not end."
"2258710","2260130"," Pause by springtime. "
"2261390","2263530"," And we'll begin to end by the summertime."
"2266110","2267390"," You might not get QE."
"2267750","2269690"," There'll be a wait and see that's why you're going to wait at every minute. "
"2269890","2271110"," That's why you're going to sell into the minutes."
"2275980","2280080"," And it's going to gradually QT is going to gradually become no QT."
"2280080","2282580"," And then probably some kind of a QE pump. "
"2286920","2288700"," Into 2025 or something like that."
"2289420","2290200"," It's kind of wild."
"2291040","2293780"," The crazy part is you would see you could possibly see that blow off top. "
"2295560","2302240"," I think help or someone posted a few days ago posted a chart that showed that 1930 type blow off"
"2302240","2302400"," top."
"2303480","2304860"," You could get something like that."
"2306580","2308300"," You get something really gnarly in a few years. "
"2309160","2311680"," And you guys always you guys are following me every day."
"2311680","2313900"," You guys always hear me say the timing is not right."
"2313940","2314680"," Timing is not right. "
"2314800","2315520"," Timing is not right."
"2316020","2316600"," Timing is not right."
"2316600","2316820"," Timing is not right. "
"2317020","2317820"," You need certain things."
"2317820","2318900"," You need like high unemployment."
"2320840","2323200"," You need companies fucking going bankrupt. "
"2323640","2326440"," You need a big GE type style company to break."
"2327420","2329840"," You start like seeing these things in the economy."
"2331900","2332920"," So it's almost like they're. "
"2334140","2336000"," It's it's this manipulated."
"2337220","2340320"," Modern monetary theory shit that they're doing."
"2342180","2345200"," They did it in the crash right of 2020 right. "
"2345420","2347580"," They stepped right in and tried to prevent the crash."
"2348440","2352340"," They we would have kept melting up in December of 2021."
"2352980","2353900"," Excuse me. "
"2353900","2355840"," You have December of 2021 would have kept melting up."
"2356260","2361160"," And so they stepped in there and tried to prevent a blow off top right."
"2361160","2365080"," And so we're now down here and you know we're looking for a crash. "
"2366360","2368580"," We're coming into this last last top."
"2369120","2374540"," This last bottom you know this last bottom and top of this down channel."
"2374960","2377100"," And people are pointing their fingers saying we're going down to. "
"2378060","2378940"," 2400 1600."
"2380840","2384940"," And you saw you saw the Q&A yesterday the softball quote unquote softball questions."
"2385400","2386760"," This is the fucking fed step in insane. "
"2387680","2389200"," We're going to attempt to prevent the crash."
"2389200","2394200"," I don't know if that works or not, but I'm telling you they're going to try."
"2396200","2397580"," They're going to try right now. "
"2399000","2402440"," And they're going to try the next three or four months into next year."
"2404880","2409720"," That's that's the whole game right now the whole system whole fucking Ponzi scheme."
"2410080","2415760"," The whole thing is an attempt to manipulate the tops and the bottoms. "
"2416520","2420020"," It's not just bottoms tops and the bottoms it's it's huge."
"2420420","2428920"," A little bit of a rug pull here and book map."
"2430640","2431240"," Liquidity break. "
"2439280","2440000"," See if we can."
"2442840","2445280"," So I think what I think we got a little bit of a liquidity break here."
"2445280","2449500"," I'll see if we get a catch and a catch and a rip restart sound eventually. "
"2450860","2452040"," So let's look for some expectations."
"2453440","2456520"," I think I told you guys I'm expecting a pullback to pivot point."
"2456700","2457740"," Or at least ask one. "
"2459000","2461560"," Make good place for some accumulation for a trip higher."
"2462500","2469000"," And then about three I would expect at least three days of accumulation ahead into the move higher."
"2473290","2474170"," There's a rug pull. "
"2487130","2493250"," The second here."
"2496560","2497660"," This would be your main."
"2500380","2501600"," What you're looking for here. "
"2507320","2512510"," A small gap down below we'll show that to I didn't see that gap."
"2531800","2535900"," I'll get some charts that you guys showing when the next minute the next meetings are the next"
"2535900","2536460"," minutes are."
"2537000","2540000"," Try to try to track or try to track a trend. "
"2541440","2542640"," Into March maybe."
"2544720","2548420"," We're looking for a bottom in January and then another one in March."
"2550440","2552400"," And you're either going to get your touch and go. "
"2553560","2558800"," You'll get some kind of a bottoming process into January to get a bottoming process into March."
"2560780","2564560"," And as they check the minutes into the next three months."
"2566160","2570420"," They'll be keen as they ramp they'll be keen keen eyes on ramping dump ramping dump. "
"2571340","2575900"," They'll be keen eyes on are we going to do the touch and go like that whole touch and go"
"2575900","2576480"," soft landing."
"2577160","2581800"," Line up for March guaranteed if we don't do that touch and go and."
"2583820","2591160"," If the Fed does start to loosen tightening pause tightening pullback tightening inflation starts to"
"2591160","2593080"," come down shortages start to disappear. "
"2594880","2600920"," Any of that stuff starts happening you're going to see the ramp right the blast off and the build"
"2600920","2602280"," up into that blast off in March."
"2603120","2607440"," Now if that doesn't happen they will sell this market down to the depths of hell by March."
"2615940","2617260"," More than Jay conics are you. "
"2619060","2622600"," That's top chat missing a whole bunch of like I'm got two different chats going to get top chat"
"2622600","2623160"," live chat."
"2624200","2625040"," All that kind of stuff."
"2625980","2627120"," So you have 106 votes. "
"2628440","2630480"," And the poll and see what the results are here."
"2636960","2642500"," So you have one to three years 55% of us three to five years 20% of us 10"
"2642500","2643500"," plus years 16%."
"2645180","2647340"," Five to 10 years 6%. "
"2648340","2650240"," That's that's that's slightly telling."
"2652460","2657220"," It's not a negative thing the cool part about this stuff is if so for the group of you that"
"2657220","2659620"," are one to three year traders the cool part is."
"2660160","2665860"," Let's say let's pretend you traded the crash or the rise from the crash in 2020 right. "
"2666500","2672300"," And you've traded this decline this year and if there is a shift in this market."
"2672300","2679160"," A trend shift as you start to add these things into your your quill right your toolbox these"
"2679160","2679640"," experiences."
"2682140","2684140"," You'll start to know what to at least look for. "
"2687680","2689600"," For trend for major trend changes."
"2691220","2694060"," Or the attempt to trend trend change at least."
"2694700","2699400"," I think that was my point this morning was I think even people with time market are like fuck. "
"2699400","2706180"," Like that that speech yesterday in that that Q&A yesterday man."
"2709080","2714680"," Even as a bull just like spooked me I was like what did what the fuck did I just hear."
"2717080","2720740"," I'm sure a long time long long and if you're a long time market participant. "
"2721320","2725160"," If you're part of that 10 plus years."
"2726060","2730880"," The 16% of you are saying you've been a market participant 10 plus years if you if you can"
"2730880","2731680"," you don't have to."
"2735560","2741540"," Let us know in the chat what you what your initial thoughts were on what was said yesterday. "
"2744360","2749480"," Help out traders or investors that only have small time in the market but I think that's a hard"
"2749480","2750060"," thing to."
"2753800","2756620"," Well yeah you're only going to get that with experience so I don't know."
"2758460","2765480"," I think that new new investors new traders would be willing to listen to what a long time market"
"2765480","2766900"," participant would have to say about this. "
"2771680","2775980"," I think that counts for something I think I think people have been in market time and markets are"
"2775980","2777820"," hard thing and it's like a valuable."
"2779260","2783180"," Thing which to find people that I have time and market so they can at least answer answer questions"
"2783180","2783780"," and say."
"2784120","2785420"," Hey man what was the like when this happened. "
"2786460","2790580"," In the past right or what was your take on what happened yesterday I think right now specifically."
"2792400","2796300"," If you're a have small time in the market they should be asking people that have."
"2797620","2800960"," Many years in market what they thought about what was said what was said yesterday. "
"2808360","2809480"," You're hungry calls."
"2813660","2817260"," I'm hungry for some consolidation down here this is what I want."

"2841650","2844670"," I was up late last night I was celebrating and."
"2844670","2851030"," And I saw I think I saw the color come up something I think a post reposted from Gex or."
"2851550","2856810"," Market or Gex edge or some some edge market edge or some someone posted some information. "
"2857230","2859230"," I had a chance to take a look at it yet."
"2861390","2862330"," I saw that right."
"2863530","2865150"," I saw it was like 350 to 410. "
"2877820","2881520"," You took it established but I'm so abused by the market that I think everything is a lot yeah I'm"
"2881520","2882240"," agree with that too."
"2884060","2886520"," The wild thing too is if they if they."
"2888400","2890660"," You're like you front run a market right. "
"2891460","2895300"," So you won't see this in the economy you won't see the economy good for like a year or two"
"2895300","2895640"," from now."
"2898910","2902750"," But they'll they'll they'll squeeze the the stock market."
"2904990","2908950"," Prior to that happening or in anticipation of that possibly happening. "
"2909830","2915870"," So that if you're like if you're like Jim Jim Boner like Captain Jim Boner and your mechanic on a"
"2915870","2920150"," mechanic right I work as a mechanic and all of a sudden the economy is getting better perceptively"
"2920150","2922330"," just some perceiving the economy is getting better."
"2922850","2924010"," I'm like I got it."
"2924230","2924950"," The economy is doing great. "
"2925210","2928630"," Look at that Apple stock it's it's huge straight at 200."
"2929370","2932050"," I got to go in there and buy some Apple economy is great."
"2932290","2936950"," Meanwhile that you know Jim that Jim the mechanic guy doesn't realize that. "
"2937630","2940210"," All these banks came in a year prior."
"2941230","2942910"," And fucking juiced it."
"2943910","2945570"," That's why you get stuck bag holding. "
"2948050","2951510"," How many fucking top buyers were there in twenty twenty one."
"2951710","2956390"," How many top buyers were there in twenty twenty with speclet spec growth right that market ended."
"2956770","2959030"," The market fucking ended in December twenty twenty. "
"2960050","2961250"," You guys know that right."
"2961630","2964350"," All the speculative growth stuff ended in a year two years ago."
"2965730","2969470"," That was the top for speclet speclet of growth two years ago. "
"2971530","2978290"," And then it like started collapsing in on on big tickers right big S&P companies then they left."
"2979690","2983210"," The ones that were had corporate debt bonds from from the Fed right."
"2983730","2985010"," So I get the last ones apples. "
"2985590","2988310"," The apples out there Microsoft those kind of companies."
"2989130","2993410"," Then the S&P 500 was the last one you could trade right up until December of twenty twenty one."
"3005480","3006240"," I was shocked. "
"3006520","3008820"," I thought that they were going to in my view right."
"3009620","3010980"," My my view was."
"3012860","3017260"," The the the the cats out of the bag that they're going to end QE. "
"3017700","3021560"," They're possibly and cute cute cute excuse me QT in next year."
"3022440","3025980"," So when I last week when I heard all the sped heads talking and they were."
"3027040","3028640"," They were just smearing shit on the wall. "
"3028820","3029680"," They had numbers all over the place."
"3029680","3031640"," If you listen closely last two weeks ago."
"3032060","3033660"," They're like well they're basically like. "
"3034260","3036380"," Well sort of just might come down in twenty three."
"3037340","3039980"," But I expect them not to come down until twenty twenty four."
"3040420","3042360"," And you're like whoa hold on there. "
"3044000","3046000"," That's a pretty fucking wide spread right there buddy."
"3046940","3047340"," And."
"3050000","3053420"," So my thoughts go on yesterday if I wrote a rant about it. "
"3054020","3054960"," That they it."
"3055640","3060040"," They can lie all they want into springtime yesterday morning for market open."
"3060040","3061780"," I was like they're going to on my view. "
"3061780","3063040"," I was like they're going to fucking lies."
"3063060","3065780"," They're going a lot from the way they had the speeches last week."
"3068640","3070220"," I was like I was like they're going to fucking. "
"3071240","3072180"," They're going to fucking."
"3073560","3077620"," Lie until the every minutes in the minutes are going to tell a different story in springtime."
"3077980","3081420"," So at some point gigs going to be up and then yesterday when he talked I was like. "
"3081420","3085000"," He's actually telling the truth or what's the pump the market or what I don't know."
"3087790","3089110"," Why is being so truthful."
"3090270","3091230"," I was quite shocked. "
"3091930","3095890"," Started trade down into the gap bill just closed the gap at four oh six forty."
"3099290","3101390"," Just slammed right down on that gap down below."
"3103770","3106170"," Price are down below four oh two ninety six. "
"3106510","3107150"," See it right here."
"3109070","3111530"," Notice how the charts not above your screen up here."
"3112130","3113130"," That's because we're going down. "
"3118070","3119750"," If you took that trade congratulations."
"3129700","3131200"," We've got more price targets down below."
"3131440","3133680"," We've got a pin at point at four oh two ninety six. "
"3134280","3135820"," We have this trend here."
"3136020","3136600"," This yellow line."
"3136720","3137560"," This is the top of the key. "
"3137700","3139200"," I think this is the bottom of the key."
"3139280","3139620"," I'm not sure."
"3140780","3141680"," We'll look at it in a bigger. "
"3145480","3148480"," So you guys can see have some context of where we are."
"3149940","3151900"," Let me mute this book map real quick."
"3154680","3156760"," To get some some perspective of where we are. "
"3160190","3161890"," So here's your point right here from yesterday."
"3162210","3164010"," This is actually when the Q&A happened I believe."
"3164870","3165270"," No. "
"3165910","3166970"," This is the initial push up."
"3167110","3168590"," No wait initial push up right here."
"3170030","3170430"," Right. "
"3170730","3172510"," And then I think we started this consolidation."
"3174230","3177090"," We had a pump and then we had one more pump then in here was when I think."
"3179290","3182290"," This is like three to five minutes I think in into the interview. "
"3185150","3190050"," And he had hit on like three or four major topics that made us go straight bars up."
"3190230","3191690"," I think this was the interview could be wrong."
"3192090","3192850"," This could have been the interview. "
"3193150","3194290"," Maybe I'm a head one step."
"3199420","3202900"," And as things unraveled and unfold we just kept melt into the clothes."
"3203240","3203900"," So let's just look at the. "
"3205580","3206740"," The key trend."
"3210430","3210830"," Right."
"3211050","3211690"," Here's the trend up. "
"3212570","3217830"," Traded outside of trend came back up and outside of trend to be looking for some kind of support in"
"3217830","3217930"," here."
"3217930","3219330"," This is the gap that needed to be filled."
"3219970","3222710"," This is the pivot point when you start getting negative again right. "
"3223350","3225030"," You want to get all bearish and stuff."
"3225830","3227410"," You want to see a break of this right."
"3228330","3230410"," I'm going to get all bearish down here. "
"3231550","3235870"," Otherwise you're going to be looking for a dip to buy here or here if you're a bull."
"3237930","3241390"," A continuation or something like this to keep our moving on."
"3242810","3243610"," In current trend. "
"3262020","3263160"," The last thing here."
"3273000","3274720"," Remember that markets are supportive."
"3279950","3281230"," You can bring this down. "
"3287290","3288750"," Here's this one down here."
"3290790","3292410"," Huge range there right."
"3292850","3293430"," Massive range. "
"3294250","3295310"," Unreal range."
"3295670","3296050"," Trading range."
"3299810","3301190"," Unreal trading range. "
"3306740","3308040"," Let's see what you guys are saying."
"3316310","3320950"," I can't trust any of those motherfuckers say you can't trust the fed man."
"3321670","3322850"," It's not really manipulated. "
"3323510","3325890"," It's full hands on."
"3327550","3333830"," It was bad in the 70s, but today's market is 100% manipulated."
"3334430","3334810"," Not manipulated. "
"3335670","3336910"," It's like hands on."
"3340370","3341130"," More in Metamorph."
"3343490","3344550"," 4 or 5 looking to buy. "
"3345610","3349390"," Let me look at 4 or 5 saying you want to be looking to buy in here."
"3350370","3351430"," Let's put some moving averages up."
"3353150","3357410"," I broke the moving averages broke Vwap. "
"3357650","3359190"," I took it a 5 minute chart."
"3359790","3361590"," Let me do some stuff here."
"3363390","3366510"," It's people shouting out some areas that are interested in buying. "
"3367730","3368450"," I took it a 5 minute."
"3373650","3374970"," It's something going on here."
"3375110","3376350"," We're at the 200 and the 5 minute. "
"3377650","3379070"," I took it a 15 minute chart."
"3379730","3380410"," Way down here."
"3381650","3383590"," This is where it's to get S1 down here. "
"3384430","3386810"," Get this yellow bar of support right here."
"3387570","3389890"," Make sure we make sure we know where that is."
"3389950","3392630"," That's at a 401-400. "
"3393290","3394210"," Let's call it 400."
"3395230","3396770"," On the 15 minute chart, 400."
"3397650","3398210"," Place of interest. "
"3398930","3402790"," You guys should already know that every round number and every number 5."
"3403390","3414220"," There should be some kind of a interesting little"
"3414220","3414420"," place."
"3414420","3415060"," Someone said 400."
"3415480","3416280"," I think someone said 400. "
"3416520","3417280"," We'll put a little."
"3418480","3419440"," Just 404."
"3433460","3435080"," Put that one in there and just see what's up. "
"3437460","3438480"," Make that one yellow."
"3445550","3453450"," It's going to go to a 1 minute here."
"3456390","3458910"," That beautiful, beautiful, beautiful selling action. "
"3478090","3478870"," And my hair."
"3479970","3480670"," One guys."
"3483210","3483950"," This is the pivot. "
"3484290","3485190"," This is S1, right?"
"3485910","3486850"," This is where I want to buy."
"3487650","3488630"," Say where I want to buy."
"3490290","3491170"," I like to buy. "
"3494880","3495460"," Right there."
"3495600","3496760"," That's where I want to buy."
"3505350","3506950"," I move this box up a little bit. "
"3524020","3525060"," Let's look on book map."
"3525280","3525660"," Let's look lower."
"3536790","3538790"," It seems like we're finding some kind of a support. "
"3539590","3543090"," You can also look below to 396250."
"3546310","3547290"," It's actually lower."
"3550270","3551150"," So 396250. "
"3553550","3554310"," Is a."
"3558710","3559970"," I think right here."
"3566240","3569020"," And that 6250 is somewhere in here."
"3569500","3576690"," Kind of like a put wall down here. "
"3576870","3578170"," 3962 somewhere in here."
"3580050","3580890"," We'll make that lower."
"3584090","3585430"," Probably a better chart right there. "
"3585430","3588850"," I don't want to buy that right there."
"3590530","3590930"," Same."
"3591090","3591830"," It's right here, but it's not. "
"3591930","3592210"," It's lower."
"3599740","3602060"," And that's I think that's the retracement too."
"3602760","3603500"," That's the full. "
"3603620","3604540"," That's a full retracement."
"3605020","3608980"," Let me mute that real quick and see it right over here."
"3615040","3625940"," And that's exactly where it starts right there. "
"3634310","3634990"," Wait a minute."
"3635070","3636050"," We got a new bar coming out."
"3636430","3637970"," See that new bar on here?"
"3638310","3641510"," We have all this stuff's happening. "
"3642570","3644890"," See that little white bar down at the bottom there?"
"3646490","3647410"," It's right at 4000."
"3648130","3649450"," That's a S1 right here."
"3653220","3654140"," So take note of that. "
"3654940","3656440"," See that white bar just popped up."
"3657920","3659440"," Get some stink bits down lower."
"3665420","3667140"," If you're looking on your screen, you see right here. "
"3675460","3676700"," We'll go to the five minute."
"3682590","3684670"," Probably a better time frame for this."
"3694930","3697590"," If you're looking for a dip to buy today, what do we normally look for?"
"3697730","3700870"," We're looking for some volume, at least the initial spike, right?"
"3701310","3703930"," Three to five million buyers, right?"
"3704090","3707170"," You want to say a three to five million volume bar on a five minute. "
"3707290","3708630"," I think three million on a five minute chart."
"3710270","3715270"," Five million would be nice, five million above on a 15 minute chart."
"3715830","3717790"," Right now, it's kind of like low buyers, low volume. "
"3719650","3720710"," So I'm not buying that."
"3721510","3722510"," No interest in it."
"3726050","3727490"," We're below the UAP right now. "
"3742500","3744180"," Three nine nine nine three."
"3746760","3749340"," So that'd be a three nine eight flat, I think."
"3750200","3751500"," Which is where S one is. "
"3753100","3756440"," So if you see this on ES, the S one is going to be three."
"3756660","3757300"," Yeah, three nine eight."
"3757300","3758260"," It's going to be S one. "
"3765770","3767870"," Still still lots of accumulation this morning."
"3770290","3771190"," Huge volume."
"3771190","3772890"," See that consolidation volume like. "
"3773210","3775990"," Two hundred ninety six thousand buyers."
"3776250","3777230"," Three hundred thousand dollars."
"3777230","3777610"," Crazy. "
"3777610","3777910"," Crazy."
"3783350","3783750"," Insane."
"3788300","3790020"," All these trap bowls are trying to go. "
"3790120","3793540"," These bulls that have been trapped for like three months or like by my shares."
"3793920","3794480"," I just want out."
"3799490","3800870"," How far back is that going?"
"3801110","3801610"," Let's look at. "
"3801730","3802610"," I'm going to look and see."
"3804970","3808250"," In my mind, I'm just saying to myself, I wonder how many bulls."
"3809290","3814790"," I wonder how like, like think about this perspective of like a Tesla stock buyer. "
"3815810","3817850"," It's different from a Tesla stock buyer's perspective."
"3819110","3822550"," So like, let's say you drank the Kool-Aid, your bull."
"3824710","3828530"," And you drank the Kool-Aid back here on. "
"3832750","3835130"," October 15th or November 15th, you're like."
"3836530","3839750"," Remember 15th, you're a Tesla bull and you're like a buying a bunch of Tesla stock."
"3840350","3844070"," And then it started rolling over and down and started blasting down to like 161. "
"3844230","3844850"," You're like."
"3847090","3853430"," Please Lord, Elon, just bring it back to just bring it back to one ninety nine two hundred so I"
"3853430","3854450"," can sell out of my position."
"3855890","3857210"," That's what's happening right now. "
"3859830","3860890"," Just get me out."
"3861590","3862570"," I don't want to play anymore."
"3865410","3867190"," I time I time when I buy wrong. "
"3867590","3868630"," Just get me out."
"3871510","3873310"," So they're doing all that right now."
"3873610","3877570"," You can see those like 300 that you can see the volume on the markets right now is massive. "
"3878370","3884050"," It's like it's like all these always upside down investors and portfolio managers that are like."
"3884630","3885470"," Here you take it."
"3885650","3886310"," You think we're going up. "
"3886410","3887270"," I just want out right now."
"3892250","3893690"," Let's see what you're saying here."
"3898720","3903220"," Schooling or that's why good traders arrested able to change their bias on a whim in my opinion. "
"3903460","3905360"," Yeah, you have to change bias on a whim."
"3906220","3908420"," And you have to be honest about what your bias is too."
"3909640","3910300"," Have to. "
"3911780","3912420"," I'm a bull."
"3912560","3913860"," Everybody knows I'm a fucking bull."
"3914020","3914860"," I'm like the old school bull. "
"3915020","3915540"," I get yelled at."
"3915820","3917900"," I get people to come in my comments every single week."
"3919100","3920560"," Same when you bulls going to learn. "
"3920920","3921720"," Fuck you bull."
"3922100","3924600"," Like people were just frustrated and scream at me."
"3926400","3927240"," So you have to be honest. "
"3927460","3929000"," Like now it's been super bearish."
"3929080","3930180"," Most bearish I've felt in."
"3931540","3932500"," Fucking all year long. "
"3935540","3936800"," And it's because they were lying."
"3937520","3939860"," I'm like another going to get caught hearing a copy now March."
"3941320","3942520"," They don't say some shit. "
"3942700","3943340"," They're going to get fucked."
"3946960","3948860"," And sure enough they said something yesterday."
"3950920","3952520"," That doesn't mean that's how you trade either. "
"3953200","3955640"," And that doesn't mean you're not like bullish and bearish on different timelines."
"3958360","3960700"," But if you'd ask what I was, I'm a bull."
"3962000","3963360"," I trade easier as a bull. "
"3963720","3964900"," I know some guys trade easier as a bear."
"3965560","3966700"," Some people like to share short."
"3966820","3968380"," They trade better shorting. "
"3968480","3969200"," I understand that."
"3970940","3975040"," And the other thing too is like saying bull or bear is typically like a."
"3977140","3978280"," Like a heel."
"3979760","3981140"," For what banks are doing. "
"3981340","3984360"," There's not like there's only really retail bulls and bears."
"3984680","3987640"," It's like it's more of a joke or an oxymoron."
"3987640","3990340"," Not an oxymoron, but it's like it's like a heel. "
"3990960","3994320"," It's just something that you use like a placeholder to say."
"3995040","3995920"," Bearish from bullish."
"3996620","3999900"," In reality, if you're just looking for supply and root supply and demand, right?"
"4000840","4001380"," Where's supply?"
"4001640","4001900"," Where's demand?"
"4002480","4003680"," I prefer to sell. "
"4007310","4010610"," I prefer to buy and demand, right?"
"4011510","4015610"," So you're trying to buy with these computers, these algorithms and trying to sell with these"
"4015610","4015950"," algorithms."
"4018450","4021030"," So it's more of just like a fucking heel."
"4021210","4022230"," It's like a wrestling heel. "
"4023170","4025570"," You're like the heels and wrestling aren't really bad guys."
"4025570","4030890"," I guess sometimes in life they are, but you know, you're playing a role of."
"4031990","4032950"," A heel. "
"4033790","4035510"," Just like you're playing a role of a hero."
"4036270","4037030"," In wrestling."
"4037350","4041030"," I know wrestling is real, but you know, like when the story lines, the soap opera, that kind of"
"4041030","4041250"," stuff. "
"4041730","4045630"," That shit's made up just to have something to talk about."
"4048480","4049760"," And some people trade better."
"4050120","4051080"," You know, supply zones. "
"4051380","4052040"," Some people trade better."
"4054080","4055440"," And demand zones."
"4060080","4063480"," He also said Fed was dumbish, which they were yesterday that it's bearish. "
"4064020","4072720"," Yeah, so if the Fed was dumbish, which they were yesterday, then it's who's saying that if the Fed"
"4072720","4073460"," was dumbish yesterday."
"4075280","4085930"," Let's see what's going on, missing"
"4085930","4086650"," some of this conversation."
"4087490","4088390"," I don't know what happened to that conversation. "
"4089190","4092370"," I hope nobody went too crazy buying yesterday unless you closed."
"4095310","4096250"," Fast down side."
"4096250","4097109"," It's okay to get new long. "
"4097250","4098770"," We've been on a weightless for a year."
"4099390","4099790"," Yeah."
"4101310","4102229"," Yeah, they're still short. "
"4102390","4102870"," Just for sure."
"4104010","4107410"," I'm not sure if it's breaks that I'm not even knowing what the time you guys are writing this."
"4107609","4108290"," Can't trust anything else. "
"4108390","4108850"," I'm going to say."
"4112090","4117390"," So you had a pivot point like 402 or 398 does that make sense to bike balls since it was"
"4117390","4117990"," going down."
"4118970","4122649"," You'll say it was dumbish yesterday, which they were that it's bearish. "
"4122930","4123510"," Yeah, there's some."
"4126750","4136569"," So my take on being bearish on the Fed stopping raising rates or restarting QE hasn't"
"4136569","4137090"," happened yet."
"4140779","4146620"," And you're also looking for, so what you were not looking for yesterday, this is kind of davish"
"4146620","4154220"," bear or davish is hawkish, davish, davish stuff is their infill manipulation mode. "
"4154399","4162880"," So what you would normally expect yesterday is for the Fed to remain, so if the so the context of"
"4162880","4168819"," someone just made a comment, they said if the Fed was davish, then it's bearish."
"4170080","4175300"," So what you're looking for yesterday, right, is you're looking for the Fed to be hawkish yesterday,"
"4175340","4175800"," right?"
"4176899","4184220"," You're looking for a bull would be looking for the Fed to be hawkish yesterday, hawkish throughout"
"4184220","4191240"," the next three to four to five months or even years, and you'd want to see the economy actually"
"4191240","4198660"," inflation come down, the crash should be managed, just like the slow trade down, and then you'd"
"4198660","4202120"," want to see just the full control from the Fed."
"4202120","4207200"," And the market would probably move up, it'd probably bottom move up, maybe even crash and keep"
"4207200","4207600"," moving. "
"4208240","4211500"," So the timing's wrong with the other stuff, like the unemployment, all that kind of stuff."
"4212200","4216520"," And what would happen would be eventually the Fed would say to you, what just happened in the past,"
"4217060","4222460"," that would say to you, they would come up publicly and say, like point blank, we've stopped QT for"
"4222460","4227720"," instituting QE, then you see the crash right after how that happens, but they're in mass"
"4227720","4228840"," manipulation mode right now."
"4229560","4232180"," We shouldn't have seen the Fed say what they said yesterday. "
"4232680","4239060"," You should have seen the Fed stay on message until they broke something."
"4250590","4253510"," Yeah, there's no reason, there's no reason Matthew to long right now."
"4254470","4260310"," No reason, you're waiting for consolidation in possibly distribution, but there's a massive amount"
"4260310","4265790"," of positioning going on right now. "
"4266050","4269770"," You've got a massive amount of traples trying to get out, you've got a massive amount of bulls"
"4269770","4279610"," trying to get in for a move up higher, not bulls, but computers, and then you've got just"
"4279610","4284810"," got a giant volume and consolidation here, it's amazing to kind of look at right now."
"4288130","4293190"," This morning, I'm still let's hit a three bucks from Monday high, John Haggard is jumping in 34"
"4293190","4299310"," bucks, but I let my last three go 500 overnight, and I'm going to use the 12, 100 is nice."
"4300310","4301930"," Yeah, now waiting, I agree with that. "
"4302430","4303230"," More than just some guy."
"4304750","4306010"," See you guys are same here."
"4310470","4314170"," Brian, what adopted as a ghost, silly and chart to include a 3D view up, nice. "
"4314630","4317330"," Yeah, I like the idea of putting a, I want to do a larger view up."
"4317750","4320950"," I don't know if I can in this charting software or not."
"4321250","4323290"," I haven't looked at it, but I keep telling myself I want to. "
"4324270","4325370"," Let's take a look at some other stuff."
"4325490","4328090"," I got some stuff for you guys to look at, at the start today."
"4330390","4335810"," I want, I want it to be Friday so bad because there's so much shit to do for next week. "
"4335810","4337410"," There's like a ton of shit we got to look at."
"4341790","4346630"," I was talking to some guys last night about putting a team of people together."
"4349610","4350630"," Let me see here. "
"4352110","4352910"," Just a second here."
"4377320","4378180"," Just a second guys."
"4392050","4393170"," So, hold on here. "
"4394310","4395670"," So let's take a look back in time."
"4404760","4406460"," This is a price percent oscillator here."
"4407500","4409180"," I'm going to follow my cursor over here, okay?"
"4412000","4417560"," So, if you want an easy way, it's a pretty simple, easy way. "
"4420690","4422890"," I want you to see that."
"4425430","4427150"," So you're just right now, okay?"
"4427510","4428050"," Hold up right here."
"4430310","4433210"," You're going to, you're going to expect the market to come back down. "
"4434650","4435050"," Right?"
"4439940","4440740"," Consolidate, right?"
"4442940","4446300"," If you start to see the PPO rise again off this white line, right?"
"4446960","4448680"," What's that, what's that telling you out there?"
"4449980","4451360"," It's telling you they're going to ramp, right?"
"4454260","4459240"," So let's say you see another, another trend down at some point and it starts coming back up as"
"4459240","4460320"," you'll see something like that, right?"
"4464740","4470460"," It'll also confirm, just like it did back here, right?"
"4470620","4470900"," We're above."
"4472840","4473920"," Stay above, right?"
"4477420","4482320"," So if you've got bears, let's say on Twitter or bulls on Twitter, doesn't matter."
"4482700","4487760"," You just got market participants on Twitter saying, I don't know, that was a fake fucking pump"
"4487760","4488200"," yesterday. "
"4488440","4489340"," The fucking market's going to burn."
"4490400","4494740"," What do they need to really make that statement true is what?"
"4498650","4499950"," We know what they need, right?"
"4503820","4505540"," Need that break below here, right?"
"4507220","4508940"," Even just a minor break below."
"4511480","4513020"," That's where you got this, right?"
"4514620","4524030"," This is where you got the argument for, this is where the argument is for"
"4524030","4526870"," we're in a bear market, we're in a bear trend, right?"
"4528350","4529870"," That's all this right here, right?"
"4531590","4532550"," You see what I'm saying?"
"4535620","4539140"," So if we start breaking down here, we're second here. "
"4553420","4555620"," If you start to see this break down below, right?"
"4558740","4563500"," You'd also start to see the stock price coming back down, not in no continuation here."
"4564600","4570620"," So if you're like market participant, that was just a bear rally."
"4571960","4577100"," You're going to be looking for that to make that statement. "
"4578940","4581580"," Just bear market rally right back into the down trend."
"4582600","4586560"," Until that happens right there, you can't fucking say that, can you?"
"4594890","4604780"," What else is cool about this is that you can see, what else is cool is that you can see"
"4607740","4609360"," consolidation on PPO, right?"
"4610340","4613580"," You actually see this come straight down into this green buy area again."
"4618200","4620460"," If you see this, what is this going to tell you?"
"4623420","4631820"," If you see that, if you see that we're like right here, right, and we're not down here, we're not"
"4631820","4632740"," down here, right?"
"4632860","4636160"," If we're like right here, what is that going to tell you?"
"4638100","4638900"," You know what I'm saying?"
"4639780","4640320"," One second here. "
"4641640","4647180"," If we trade down a little bit, trade down here where you have divergence, right?"
"4649200","4653470"," And you've come all the way down here, what is that telling you?"
"4657410","4658550"," What would that be telling you?"
"4658650","4663090"," It's going to fucking tell you that we're fucking going to blast off right here, isn't it?"
"4668160","4672880"," As you can correlate this right here to this whole timeline back here."
"4674120","4674740"," Make sense?"
"4676420","4681760"," Just keep your eyes on the PPO, keep your eyes on a market breath indicator, see where the breath"
"4681760","4682060"," is."
"4682540","4684820"," If you're a bull, that's what you want to see this as a bull. "
"4684960","4689640"," This is the setup you're looking for as a bull, heading into January, March."
"4694920","4697560"," You see this setup heading into January and March, right?"
"4697900","4698740"," I can assure you."
"4699200","4702920"," It would be something like this, you know, and we come back down here. "
"4705140","4707740"," You'd be looking for this into March, something like this."
"4712230","4714970"," If you come down, you'd bump, you'd stay up."
"4716170","4718570"," We down and up, this would be like January and March. "
"4720170","4727790"," It would be January, this would be March, and you'd see a stay above PPO."
"4729650","4733450"," If you see that, in a January and March, we're fucking bottomed."
"4733710","4736250"," There ain't nothing you can say about it, if that's what data shows. "
"4751220","4752920"," And that goes back to trading the levels, right?"
"4752920","4757940"," It goes back to telling you to always be open to a shift."
"4770670","4771570"," Yeah, I had my best."
"4771830","4773230"," I had calls before the speech. "
"4773950","4775410"," I was holding, I got stopped out of them."
"4775930","4778190"," I thought, you know what's crazy about yesterday's speech was?"
"4778670","4783830"," So I went in, I bought, I think, 394 C's, 394's or 396's at bottom."
"4784610","4785310"," And then I got panicky. "
"4785310","4790410"," I was like, I'm going to put on 70 cents, I think I put a stop at 70 cents."
"4791350","4796850"," And we fucking slammed down real quick, like, like an instant, like a millisecond."
"4797630","4800630"," Knocked me out of my calls and then blasted off to that red mark yesterday. "
"4801390","4803030"," That red upper range and tagged it."
"4803270","4803410"," Bam."
"4803790","4807170"," So I fucking missed, I think I missed like a 300% trade right there. "
"4808330","4813210"," And then as soon as we hit there was like, wait, when the comments started changing to, uh, to"
"4813210","4816770"," bullish, and I was like, in stream going, what?"
"4817050","4819230"," Are we a policy shift change right now?"
"4819710","4821670"," And I was like, you have to instantaneously."
"4822650","4824870"," I'm like, fucking getting the beer suit off going."
"4825130","4826430"," What the fuck is he saying right now?"
"4828230","4829590"," And it was kind of fucking crazy. "
"4830650","4831810"," This fucking kind of crazy."
"4834870","4835750"," What's Sparky saying?"
"4838810","4839730"," Sparky's always got the shit."
"4839970","4840490"," He knows what's up. "
"4840750","4841530"," 4K is awesome too."
"4841690","4843430"," Real ugly, 30 minute and early can is closing here."
"4844030","4845350"," Retest the highest question mark. "
"4845810","4849450"," All I see in book map is one circle that is labeled as CBD with the X."
"4849570","4850370"," Yeah, I got to get rid of that."
"4851850","4853430"," That's all my list of shit to do here."
"4854050","4857450"," I have to get rid of that little like Captain Jim James icon on the bottom right hand side. "
"4858590","4861690"," That's some back of the house kind of shit I have to do for the channel."
"4867720","4872420"," I just friend of mine of the three month tenure spread as year 2000 levels averted."
"4872620","4872720"," Yep. "
"4873040","4874020"," And they know that too."
"4874640","4877040"," If you have some magnetism, do you believe in it or not?"
"4877220","4878320"," Yeah, I love trading VWAP."
"4880420","4881260"," You know, it's funny. "
"4881440","4887740"," So I like, I'm not really a big LA wave practitioner, but I will check LA wave counts, multiple"
"4887740","4893500"," counts against classic charting volume profile market profile."
"4893500","4894440"," I'll check all those."
"4894760","4896280"," I'm trying to look for some confluences. "
"4897520","4899020"," Previous high previous lows."
"4905770","4906470"," I'll check."
"4906670","4906750"," I'll check. "
"4906750","4907490"," I'll check."
"4909170","4910290"," I'll check."
"4912010","4915590"," Classic charting techniques against Fibonacci levels. "
"4915710","4916430"," All the wave counts."
"4917210","4920370"," Previous high lows, like the reason why I'm always checking different."
"4921030","4924670"," T a, everybody's different got different T a moving averages. "
"4924670","4929410"," Whenever there's like a coincidence of all of those different, one of the cool parts is that if"
"4929410","4930390"," you're checking different."
"4933450","4937750"," Different places people trade to, and you can get a confluence of all those at the same time."
"4938330","4939150"," You'll get enough. "
"4941170","4944030"," Computers and algorithms that are all focused on that one number."
"4946890","4949530"," Gamma in the market, if it lines up to FIB levels."
"4951110","4956430"," If you start looking at people's different trading methods, especially what lots of traders trade"
"4956430","4956730"," to. "
"4957270","4960490"," You know a lot of traders, a lot of hedge funds trade to LA wave."
"4961170","4963930"," So you know you're going to get some action on those numbers."
"4964250","4965990"," No matter what, you're going to see some action there. "
"4966910","4972390"," When they all kind of coincide together, it's usually a large move in the market, a large pivot in"
"4972390","4972710"," the market."
"4976390","4980670"," We can downtrend, also reloaded some spy puts, exit previously."
"4987620","4988700"," Oh, I see what you're saying. "
"4988900","4990700"," You're saying on your end on your book map."
"4991180","4991780"," Yeah, there's a toggle."
"4992060","4996840"," If you're using a thicker swim, they have limited options. "
"4998220","5000220"," If you use the real book map, it's got better options."
"5006760","5010660"," Yeah, when we slam down and you close those, I got knocked out and then I didn't re-enter."
"5011600","5012400"," Yeah, that happens. "
"5012800","5014760"," I got fucked up."
"5014880","5020320"," Dude, I fucking, so I lost money on that trade and that trade went up 300% and it kept"
"5020320","5020820"," going up."
"5020980","5023860"," In a matter of fact, do you want to know what that trade closed at the end of the day?"
"5024240","5027920"," Because you want to talk about a fucking mistrade?"
"5028280","5032440"," Had I not put that, if you can catch me on stream, it was like maybe a minute. "
"5033520","5034460"," Maybe three minutes."
"5034580","5034800"," I don't know."
"5034960","5040420"," Just really close to when, really close to 130, I was like, I'm putting a 70 cent stop on this"
"5040420","5040660"," thing. "
"5041100","5042580"," Had I forgotten to put that stop?"
"5043480","5044480"," We kept going up."
"5044640","5045840"," That fucking trade was worth."
"5045900","5047380"," At the end of the day, it was worth $13. "
"5049700","5051520"," Something like that, $13, $14."
"5052420","5054600"," At the end of the day, it was fucking stupid."
"5056460","5057740"," It was fucking stupid. "
"5059920","5062660"," Had I just forgotten to put a stop on that fucking trade?"
"5064720","5066300"," Oh, you know what else happened last night?"
"5066540","5068000"," I fucking, so last night I went out."
"5069140","5070900"," They come on me in a windstorm last night."
"5071880","5076780"," I put a, I put a new shower door in like a glass wall and a shower door. "
"5077540","5078480"," I put it on my back porch."
"5078800","5082400"," The fucking windstorm slammed the fucking thing down and it shattered."
"5083640","5085960"," A couple thousand dollar fucking shower door. "
"5086780","5088300"," I was so pissed last night."
"5092100","5093560"," I had risk on anyway."
"5094860","5101360"," I sold on my 386, it was like 1996, yesterday in the stream, we had like thousands of people in"
"5101360","5101560"," here. "
"5103100","5109780"," And as soon as it seemed like the trade was over yesterday, as soon as it seemed like the trade"
"5109780","5111060"," was over yesterday, I ever cleared out."
"5111060","5113940"," And then I went to Twitter, I scrolled through Twitter once."
"5114900","5115840"," And Twitter was quiet. "
"5116360","5119060"," And so I came back on stream and I started asking people, hey, what's going on on Twitter?"
"5119800","5122540"," And no one had any information on what was going on Twitter and been to it."
"5123680","5126000"," And then the fucking market just kept fucking going up, man."
"5126160","5127420"," This shit went up until fucking Bell. "
"5128500","5132860"," And I was like, I wonder how many people, I'm not having traders just like close their, like made"
"5132860","5139180"," their bank and walked it or said, fucking I'm out or I'm pissed off or whatever."
"5141780","5145640"," Because I think at the end of the last couple hours, it was like two or three hundred of us"
"5145640","5145920"," in here."
"5147720","5150420"," It went way down viewer count. "
"5150900","5154580"," And then we just started, it just started fucking melting and melting and melting and melting and"
"5154580","5158040"," melting and melting and melting and melting and melting and melting and melting."
"5158380","5158760"," It was wild."
"5162950","5168510"," The slam to take up stops is the tell that it wanted to go up, take off the bear suit. "
"5168510","5169750"," Yeah, I had to take off the bear suit."
"5170650","5171250"," Wait a minute."
"5171750","5172490"," So you got the same. "
"5178390","5179030"," Uh, weekly's."
"5179290","5180190"," Yeah, as long as we stay."
"5180410","5181250"," So that's a good question. "
"5181430","5182130"," Who's asking that question?"
"5183170","5189050"," Uh, so when you're, so Abraham weeklies do a much better and a positive gamma environment."
"5190050","5193310"," I would, if you're going to trade, but you know, if you want like safety."
"5194130","5195910"," Better to buy like a monthly or even a three month. "
"5196690","5202110"," And, uh, price target buying a low and positive gamma about like a month out or a three month out,"
"5202130","5204610"," a call option close to being in the money."
"5206070","5210770"," Then you're not fucking dealing with the bullshit of the, uh, of the up and down moves, the theta"
"5210770","5210930"," burn."
"5213620","5215000"," If that's how you want to go about it. "
"5215140","5217040"," I always like spreads in positive gamma environments."
"5217300","5217980"," We'll look at that too."
"5218500","5219200"," Let's look at that right now. "
"5219280","5222180"," Let's talk about, I guess so much should talk to you guys about."
"5223060","5225600"," Uh, we won't look right now because we got a bounce coming up right here."
"5225600","5227340"," Let's see if we get some rejection off this gap bill. "
"5229660","5232020"," Came right in, bought it all up like it was no big deal."
"5232240","5233280"," Markets are our support."
"5233400","5234580"," This shows support in the market. "
"5235080","5235960"," We're not selling the rip."
"5236160","5237200"," We're not blood red."
"5238140","5239260"," You'll see dips get bought. "
"5242680","5245540"," Um, but I got a bunch of stuff to show you guys, especially the new traders."
"5246100","5250880"," Uh, on if this market is going to do this, if this market does turn around or if this is"
"5250880","5251240"," a bottom."
"5252140","5255620"," Uh, you're going to be able to, in a supportive market, you're going to be able to come in every"
"5255620","5261020"," three or four weeks and buy a dip safe in relative safety. "
"5262880","5268020"," And run it up for three weeks, four weeks, not four weeks, three weeks, cash them out."
"5269380","5272660"," And then you'll wait for a decline over a week or so."
"5273000","5275960"," Usually around, I think it starts around the 12th or 14th. "
"5276680","5279040"," You get the decline usually by the 21st or so."
"5280640","5284740"," When you rebuy back in once more, run it up three weeks, get out, you're in, you're out."
"5286320","5287340"," Now you can do spreads. "
"5287600","5288420"," You can do in the money calls."
"5288580","5290890"," You put one or three months on them in relative safety."
"5291880","5293800"," And you're just like cash and checks. "
"5294760","5298000"," Cash and checks, cash and checks, cash and checks, cash and checks."
"5301340","5302480"," Some of you guys will run away."
"5302840","5303940"," You'll meet some kind of a guy. "
"5304060","5305240"," It's popping some shit stock."
"5306660","5308580"," That's a little happen to get greedy."
"5309740","5313020"," Start coming to the feed and telling me how XYZ company is going to be fucking next. "
"5314000","5316400"," Ford or next, whatever would be fun."
"5320080","5321420"," Let's take a look at the book map."
"5329820","5331180"," Coming into the gap that we filled. "
"5331660","5337400"," If you don't get any resistance here, we're more than likely going to start blasting off again."
"5341360","5343020"," Price target would be the high of the day."
"5343780","5346420"," If you want to see it, it'd be something like this. "
"5347440","5347800"," Move up."
"5349140","5349540"," Consolidation."
"5350180","5353320"," Go up and attempt to attack this 410. "
"5354960","5356860"," Then you'll hear the bears say this is the double top."
"5371920","5373820"," Think of some book map does have the two."
"5373900","5376160"," Yeah, they have the two COD, the CVD circles. "
"5377200","5381400"," But there's options within those circles in the back end and the regular book map that have more"
"5381400","5383140"," options."
"5387840","5393340"," You bought some initially up at like 395 right above the pivot and then it dropped."
"5393600","5396820"," And you're paying as I close that, then I ran it with you back below. "
"5396980","5398120"," And then I got nailed to times."
"5400220","5401620"," The joys of a remodel."
"5401760","5402580"," Yeah, I got fucked in that. "
"5403520","5404480"," I'm along here at 407."
"5405840","5407020"," I should have just held all of it."
"5407840","5408520"," But I just got salty. "
"5408720","5409540"," Yeah, I got salty too."
"5410260","5411500"," You get it from Costco."
"5411880","5412320"," Just return it. "
"5412420","5413140"," Oh, no, fuck no."
"5413860","5414220"," I got it."
"5414380","5414680"," I got it. "
"5416700","5418800"," I bought this fucking thing like."
"5420820","5422160"," During COVID, I bought it."
"5422540","5423420"," Like the beginning of COVID. "
"5424300","5429770"," I was loading up on shit during COVID."
"5433010","5434670"," Tesla seems to be gaining power."
"5435970","5439090"," Lord Pat, you'll see, you should see the biggest ramp in tech. "
"5440490","5441210"," Speculical growth."
"5441810","5442490"," Shit stocks too."
"5444170","5445870"," And that would include Tesla. "
"5446390","5447770"," All bets are off with Tesla at this point."
"5448430","5450590"," They don't think that they'll be a couple."
"5450750","5454710"," If you're going to see like FOMO money coming to the market. "
"5460760","5461400"," State here."
"5461560","5461600"," Yeah."
"5462600","5463920"," People I do specs always pump. "
"5464900","5468960"," Yeah, you'll see a new you'll see a new you'll see like channels pop back up."
"5469360","5472460"," You're going to start saying channels pop back up and you'll see guys out there and."
"5475060","5478160"," They're these there's there's like trading groups, right?"
"5478800","5481240"," And as some of you guys probably know, some of you guys probably don't. "
"5481320","5486240"," But there are trading groups with boiler room type guys with that kind of experience."
"5486960","5488600"," And let me each other in DMS and stuff."
"5489080","5490540"," Start making YouTube channels. "
"5491360","5491760"," Discords."
"5493660","5498080"," And what they'll do is they'll start popping up videos on a company."
"5499300","5500880"," They'll take positions these companies. "
"5501760","5505720"," And we'll start selling them to their moderators and their discords."
"5505980","5507620"," The moderators will take the next position."
"5508780","5512120"," And then they'll do like a, you know, like tell their their followers. "
"5513000","5514760"," Buy all this and then tell your friends."
"5515540","5521440"," And then people get on stock twits and fucking Twitter and fucking pay for bots to make posts"
"5521440","5522560"," really fucked up shit."
"5522560","5532340"," And then of course they exit first and then the the the into their group"
"5532340","5533740"," members will exit next. "
"5534660","5536860"," And then the discord people will exit next."
"5536860","5539260"," And then of course that the stupid John Q."
"5540620","5546900"," Pump buyer will exit last and get stuck with the bags and they'll repeat rinse repeat rinse repeat"
"5546900","5548320"," rinse repeat."
"5549060","5553120"," If we go back into a bull market, you'll see that happen, which is kind of fucking gross. "
"5553620","5554860"," That that will happen."
"5557960","5560000"," Yeah, 90% of them do suck real bad."
"5560900","5563860"," They tend to go away or you don't see as much of it. "
"5564680","5566980"," Again, this decline you watched over the two years."
"5568340","5571120"," Since the past two years, like 2022, 2021."
"5571780","5575940"," You just started seeing getting less and less and less and then real quiet past few months. "
"5575940","5578860"," And you'll you'll see the rise of them again."
"5579340","5584940"," Oh, yeah, you're so."
"5586400","5590020"," Don mafia say to you on how also has a record of song shares into these events. "
"5590760","5595100"," You're seeing that today when you're seeing the volume even today continue the continuation of"
"5595100","5595380"," volume."
"5596040","5598200"," It's like it's like horse trade with people with big money."
"5598640","5600560"," You have people that are upside down when I get out. "
"5601160","5605160"," You have people that want to reposition themselves with lots of money, right?"
"5605780","5608840"," How many position you've got portfolio managers that are hiding in the Dow."
"5609540","5610000"," Right?"
"5610220","5611980"," Tons of portfolio managers are hiding in the Dow."
"5612260","5613880"," I was talking to Brad yesterday. "
"5614960","5615820"," I think it was Brad."
"5615940","5617040"," I forget who I was talking to when I said."
"5618480","5621220"," You might see the Dow actually come down a little bit. "
"5621660","5626720"," You might see a shift of money from hiding in the Dow coming out to play in tech."
"5630080","5632880"," So you could actually see some weakness in the Dow still."
"5633920","5636460"," And then a ramp in the queues. "
"5641990","5644590"," You can also buy ads on Yahoo Finance to pump stocks."
"5644590","5645110"," No shit."
"5645410","5646930"," Yeah, I don't know much about. "
"5647170","5648850"," I've been in those trading group."
"5648990","5650650"," I like paying against this trade group."
"5650990","5653490"," I used to trade penny stocks and one to $3. "
"5653930","5659150"," Not real true pennies, but like anywhere from $1 to $20, $25 back in the day."
"5662050","5664810"," And got invited into some of those groups a couple times."
"5664990","5667190"," I didn't know that they even existed like in the back end. "
"5667190","5670050"," They never knew that they were pumping dump groups."
"5673890","5678430"," I had like, I buy a large chair position in a company and they'd show up to their ER."
"5679190","5680950"," Ask a bunch of stupid questions, record it. "
"5681590","5683190"," Come back to everybody and show it and stuff."
"5683410","5685310"," And at that time I was naive."
"5685530","5691030"," I had no idea that I was helping pumping dumpers. "
"5691250","5693470"," And then of course finally they unveiled themselves."
"5693750","5695110"," And I was like, they were like, you want to join our group?"
"5695110","5695850"," And I'm like, fuck no."
"5696270","5697650"," I wasn't going to fucking do it that shit. "
"5698990","5700410"," I didn't know that was real."
"5700950","5701850"," And it's real."
"5702630","5703990"," It's 100% they're out there. "
"5708960","5710180"," Yeah, it should totally be illegal."
"5711080","5715780"," What's crazy too is that one instance where I figured when the veil was lifted for me."
"5716740","5718560"," These are some guys that I trusted. "
"5719900","5721860"," Over time I'd become the trust them."
"5721920","5723220"," And I was like, these guys know what they're talking about."
"5723280","5724460"," These guys know the technicals. "
"5724520","5726140"," These guys know the financials."
"5726140","5729280"," These guys know the CEOs of these small companies."
"5729440","5732120"," These guys know the news is coming up to all this stuff, right?"
"5733140","5735920"," And they've done their due diligence, right?"
"5737400","5738940"," That's why I don't believe in due diligence anymore. "
"5739260","5741600"," I don't have no fucking faith in any due diligence in a company."
"5742780","5744160"," I think they get bought."
"5744360","5746640"," They get driven up and then they get sold profit. "
"5748380","5749100"," All companies."
"5749380","5750500"," That's what I think what happens when it happens."
"5752960","5755020"," Everything's a pump and dump fucking scheme one way or another. "
"5755020","5756320"," But I had no idea."
"5756580","5757140"," I was like a young trader."
"5757560","5766300"," And then, of course, I finally was looking up to a guy and I finally confided in me what they"
"5766300","5766620"," were doing. "
"5766760","5768140"," And I was like, wow, this is funny."
"5768280","5772120"," He was like, I'm only telling you because I don't want to get burned in your position."
"5773380","5775020"," He's like, this is one big fucking pump and dump. "
"5775240","5777300"," And me and all my guys were all involved in this."
"5777300","5777860"," And I was like, what?"
"5778920","5780360"," So it was kind of an eye opener for me."
"5783630","5784750"," It happens all the time. "
"5786250","5788330"," They go from stock to stock to stock to stock."
"5789290","5790010"," It's kind of crazy."
"5792770","5794430"," Yeah, cocaine beer is a real fucking movie. "
"5794990","5798430"," I think Jenny Marcus said the other day he was like, or he reposted it."
"5798530","5800790"," And I was like, I got to follow this fucking guy."
"5800910","5801370"," This guy's great. "
"5801570","5802650"," And I had no idea it was a movie either."
"5802890","5804550"," And then I saw the trailer on Reddit or something."
"5805370","5806790"," And I was like, oh, it's a real fucking movie. "
"5807830","5810790"," That shit's going to be memed and memed and memed and memed."
"5811170","5814550"," I don't know if the movie is out yet or not, but when it does come out, I know I'm"
"5814550","5817950"," going through and fucking cutting a bunch of the fucking scenes out of that shit."
"5819390","5821630"," That shit's going to be the most memed fucking movie. "
"5822390","5825610"," I don't know who came up with it, but whoever did came up with that shit."
"5826090","5827350"," It's going to get memed to fucking."
"5827530","5833530"," It's going to become like a huge meme, huge cocaine beer. "
"5837190","5841170"," Yeah, lots of that shit."
"5841170","5843250"," That's where I encountered it was in pharma."
"5844070","5845630"," It was in biotech pump and dumps. "
"5847590","5857450"," It was biotech pump and dumps and then there was some shit after 9 "
"5857450","5859170","-11 with security stocks and stuff."
"5859950","5861350"," Oh, and fucking never."
"5861610","5862790"," This is another crazy one. "
"5862870","5868730"," I remember when MJ stocks the first time they got the big pump."
"5868730","5870330"," I want to say that was 2017."
"5875450","5876350"," It could have been earlier. "
"5876630","5876870"," I don't know."
"5877170","5878730"," 2017, I think it was the first MJ pump."
"5878870","5879290"," Maybe it was earlier. "
"5879930","5880910"," I'm a fucking date myself."
"5881190","5883370"," It could have been like seven or ten years ago."
"5883530","5887290"," I remember when they did the second MJ stock pump and people were like, are you going to buy MJ"
"5887290","5887670"," stocks?"
"5887910","5888810"," I was like, fuck no, man. "
"5888910","5890470"," I was in the first fucking pump and got burned."
"5891210","5892050"," Fuck you, get out of here."
"5892950","5895890"," I don't care what fucking MJ stocks going back up. "
"5896310","5902030"," I think I had been like, I had some stragglers that I wound up owning for like fucking three or"
"5902030","5904730"," five years or something that I was like, these are never coming back."
"5905370","5907810"," When they had the next pump, I was like, get me out of this shit."
"5908050","5910190"," I was like, I'll never ever buy an MJ stock ever again. "
"5910750","5912010"," I was like, fucking."
"5917280","5918740"," Dechmar trades, never heard of them."
"5924390","5928290"," I don't know who Dechmar is. "
"5929990","5932110"," I'm wearing a broke higher, so glad I closed my shirt yesterday."
"5934660","5937380"," Yeah, I don't, I haven't even looked at my shit for the dial yet."
"5937400","5938520"," I'm not fucking looking. "
"5939260","5941140"," I'm not, I fucking refuse to look at it."
"5941640","5942800"," I don't even want to fucking know."
"5943520","5946560"," I just want the fucking market to roll at some point between now and March. "
"5947360","5950140"," I'm going to open those fucking things up and see what they're looking like."
"5953760","5955720"," What's this based on a true story, cocaine bear?"
"5958200","5960240"," These groups don't teach anything you're a loving member."
"5960240","5965240"," Yeah, I didn't, when the bill was revealed to me, I was pretty fucking upset. "
"5965700","5969440"," And I was grateful for the heads up to this one guy in particular."
"5970120","5972380"," And I think he's still kind of an active trader."
"5974240","5976700"," And I think I know who he is on Twitter. "
"5977580","5979420"," And I've never brought it up to him."
"5981600","5983080"," I'll never DM him about it."
"5983240","5985240"," I don't talk to him either. "
"5985840","5988960"," I'm not sure it's him and he might deny it now."
"5989720","5994400"," But I'm friends with him, but I'm an interactor with him."
"5997880","5999160"," I was shocked. "
"5999840","6004020"," And it was weird because we were talking day in, day in, day out DMs all day long."
"6004720","6009200"," Like DMs, DMs, DMs, DMs. The one that I figured it out for, he told me, I didn't figure shit"
"6009200","6009360"," out. "
"6011100","6012640"," I felt fucking violated."
"6013720","6014940"," And I was like, what the fuck is this?"
"6016240","6018520"," I was like, I'm fucking wasting my time doing all this bullshit."
"6024860","6025460"," I don't know. "
"6025660","6027300"," I'll look them up to mark trade."
"6027600","6028640"," What did you say they were?"
"6031000","6032020"," I'll write that name down."
"6033380","6034020"," Deckbar trades. "
"6035660","6036340"," I'll look them up."
"6036580","6037340"," I don't know anything about them."
"6042880","6044460"," There's a true story apparently a little bit. "
"6044640","6045920"," Sharknana was a true story too."
"6046920","6049300"," Bears will need more than Coke to go through the winter pivot."
"6050160","6051160"," Jedi posted the trailer. "
"6051460","6052920"," Yeah, Jedi posted the trailer."
"6056350","6056830"," It's great."
"6057010","6057710"," I'm going to move money around the world. "
"6058010","6059110"," OG money laundering before BTC."
"6059570","6059810"," No shit."
"6060490","6061250"," I didn't know that either. "
"6062510","6063970"," All the pompadambers moved to crypto."
"6064230","6065370"," Yeah, there's a big pompadam crypto."
"6066450","6068190"," I take myself today about that shit. "
"6069370","6072050"," There's some moments in my life where I really fucked up."
"6072450","6073150"," That's one of them."
"6073970","6074570"," I used to. "
"6074830","6077910"," I used to go to Burning Man years and years ago."
"6079550","6082850"," And I was an early adopter of Bitcoin when it was worthless."
"6083250","6088430"," And I had a good friend of mine who was mining it in 2007 or eight or some shit out"
"6088430","6091270"," of his – he was an engineer at a TV station. "
"6092230","6094050"," And he was using all their servers to mine it."
"6096390","6098730"," And the time that – I don't know if my wife was my wife then."
"6098870","6102590"," She might have been, but she was like, sell all your shit and get out. "
"6102910","6104470"," We were coming into a halving or something."
"6105870","6108030"," And she was like, get out now and don't ever do that shit again."
"6108610","6113830"," And the head I just held and held and held and held it would be fucking – probably worth a"
"6113830","6115110"," few hundred million dollars today. "
"6115870","6116790"," That's all fucked up, that is."
"6118430","6123050"," And I was using it for buying illegal substances on the Internet."
"6123670","6127530"," And I was like, this will never fucking – I believe this will never become something common. "
"6128290","6129790"," It will always be used for this kind of shit."
"6130770","6134510"," It will always be used for buying and selling drugs and shit."
"6134550","6136130"," It will never make mainstream fucking sure enough. "
"6137150","6138090"," That was a big fuck up."
"6138810","6141630"," I should have just bought and held all that shit and never fucking sold it."
"6144090","6147670"," Now I watch all the pumpers on fucking crypto and I'm like, this is all crazy. "
"6149770","6150810"," And this is insane."
"6152170","6153110"," This is insane."
"6154510","6156690"," The same technology that's used for credit card transactions. "
"6157490","6157750"," Come on."
"6159690","6160810"," Life-changing, come on."
"6162190","6166350"," Of course I know the story of silver, so that's what I'm waiting for is once the government steps"
"6166350","6167030"," and it's all over. "
"6167230","6167670"," The gig is up."
"6170170","6173830"," If you have a chance to watch The Hunt Brothers and just imagine that with crypto."
"6182210","6190730"," We've got just some guys saying we're going to fucking 4, 4, 100 with LTC and ETH in 2011. "
"6190970","6192190"," Do my buddy."
"6192530","6193670"," He's fucking filthy rich now."
"6194130","6195330"," He's filthy fucking rich. "
"6196130","6200970"," So if you see the crazy, no offense to Bitcoiners or crypto guys out there."
"6201550","6205170"," But you know how some people are just fucking constantly on the pump?"
"6205670","6207290"," He was like that when it was worthless."
"6207990","6209910"," And in my life was like, he's fucking crazy. "
"6209910","6211010"," He stopped that stupid shit."
"6212090","6212630"," Fuck it."
"6215070","6217670"," It was probably the biggest mistake I've ever made in my life. "
"6219090","6221770"," Or like, I could have been a fucking bazillionaire."
"6221950","6222790"," That was it right there."
"6224670","6229850"," The worst trade of my life, selling fucking BTC or Bitcoin when it was fucking worthless. "
"6231170","6232350"," Like fucking worthless."
"6234270","6234910"," Fucking worthless."
"6239770","6243150"," Can I speak to the viability of Max Payne as an indicator in this type of market moment?"
"6245130","6247530"," Yeah, we can speak about. "
"6248190","6250350"," Well, so Max Payne doesn't work like he used to."
"6251630","6252990"," He used to be a really cool hit."
"6253150","6254590"," So back in the back of the day. "
"6255430","6260150"," There is a time maybe let's call it five years ago where not many people knew about Max Payne."
"6261370","6262870"," There wasn't a huge options market."
"6264170","6266050"," So it was kind of consistent. "
"6268690","6274210"," And there were some models for the life and pricing of options as well that were pretty consistent."
"6274610","6275190"," But all that's changed."
"6276310","6284610"," You're seeing Max Payne levels change and be reset on a smaller time frame than what the data sets"
"6284610","6290130"," that are being used in models are being presented publicly. "
"6290810","6295390"," So unless you've got free data sets from CME and then you have to pay for data sets."
"6296570","6301930"," Big money for current data sets and not all the services that are selling."
"6302690","6304370"," What Max Payne is that day. "
"6305050","6309350"," Are able to update or pay for the updates to be actually current."
"6309990","6311050"," As a matter of fact."
"6311770","6315370"," At some point last two weeks ago or something I made some comments about. "
"6316850","6320930"," A Max Payne there was like a Max Payne shift middle of a day."
"6323780","6327320"," There was a resetting of Max Payne levels like a hundred points."
"6327980","6329960"," And I was like this is bullshit. "
"6331120","6332880"," Like this is bullshit."
"6333400","6333720"," This is."
"6336100","6342260"," So you're having so you know you got three major influencers now you've got people that everyone"
"6342260","6344880"," knows everyone everyone knows about Max Payne levels you've got. "
"6346580","6349740"," Algorithms are being built trade that stuff and then you've got."
"6352280","6353900"," You've got algorithm or you've got."
"6356360","6360320"," Algorithms coming in and then manipulating the market with with zero data options. "
"6361700","6363360"," Which are which is then."
"6365240","6366660"," Basterizing Max Payne levels."
"6369940","6371520"," I don't know if I'm saying that right. "
"6378120","6381800"," So I've got a large position so let's say I've got a let's say I've got a large position."
"6381960","6386540"," Let's say I've got a 10 million dollars on the 10 millions on a good idea."
"6387000","6388640"," Like the GPM trades on a big collar. "
"6388880","6390480"," They're larger collars in the market."
"6391280","6396600"," So let's say I have a billion dollars on a collar at 400 for today."
"6397660","6401060"," And I want the I want the I want I want to hit 400 today. "
"6401060","6403460"," And I want it to be at 400 for most of the day."
"6403820","6404680"," Or let's say this week."
"6405300","6407800"," I want to keep it on 400 or near 400 or pin to 400. "
"6409160","6410000"," For the next week."
"6411420","6418160"," And some outside influence the markets trying to push the price of spy away from 400."
"6420940","6425860"," So I can come in and I've got my billion dollar trade I come in with just one 10 million"
"6425860","6426540"," dollars. "
"6427260","6433980"," And nudge the market around into where I want the price to pin to cheaply."
"6435300","6436920"," And it would be cost to do in business."
"6438400","6441680"," If I let other people know that I've got that collar on that price of 400. "
"6441680","6446380"," I can also get other people to trade to it or against to help as well."
"6447120","6454660"," So there's there's Max Payne is a moving target."
"6454660","6457280"," It would be the best way to describe it. "
"6459080","6465060"," Currently in a change is so frequently that people aren't paying for the data to show the Max Payne"
"6465060","6465560"," number changing."
"6469580","6471660"," Sometimes on an intraday basis wildly."
"6476240","6477680"," Yeah, we're on VWAP right now. "
"6478480","6479280"," Mess around VWAP."
"6484740","6490280"," I do want to hear regret I had 22 85 C calls on cues yesterday when we dumped two eighties"
"6490280","6492380"," average to about 42 cents sold at 60."
"6494000","6494660"," That's horrible. "
"6494740","6495440"," That's horrifying."
"6503640","6507240"," Five five bucks for just nothing just knowing the volume."
"6507540","6507600"," Yeah. "
"6510420","6512380"," 35 GME calls back when it pumped."
"6512760","6517040"," Strike was 30 bucks got out and then it went across from 400 to 78."
"6518620","6520740"," I own GME before the first pump. "
"6521240","6522680"," I own the stock and I owned options."
"6525940","6530000"," I think a suspected saboteur knows all about that story."
"6530760","6534160"," Kim and I were trading that back in December January. "
"6534540","6535340"," A couple years ago."
"6536100","6537460"," I thought the Wall Street better is wild."
"6542710","6543430"," Thanks, Pinky. "
"6551720","6553320"," Yeah, you can you can check my Twitter."
"6554320","6556280"," I think it's still I don't delete any of my tweets."
"6556480","6557160"," I leave all of them up. "
"6557880","6559660"," You can go back to my Twitter and check back then."
"6564210","6566790"," But I think that pisses me off about not quite GME."
"6567830","6572270"," But the AMC thing is the CEO is a fucking scumbag. "
"6574210","6576250"," He loans his shares out to short it down."
"6576470","6578250"," I think he owns them at like $1.50 or something."
"6578730","6580070"," $1.50 or $3 or something. "
"6581290","6583370"," He loans his shares out to short stock down."
"6593160","6594100"," He's a fucking villain."
"6595500","6596520"," He's a fucking deuce bag. "
"6598120","6599700"," I don't understand the AMC thing."
"6600060","6604500"," I got no fucking love for the metamorphosis in the AMC being a part of that."
"6605120","6609540"," I feel really bad for people that cut GME late too. "
"6611820","6613240"," That shit took a life of its own."
"6613620","6618620"," That's about time when all the old school Wall Street better started getting account bands or IP"
"6618620","6619340"," bands on Reddit."
"6620980","6624320"," That's when the admins, the site admins, not just the sub. "
"6624740","6626960"," The old admins of the old, the old."
"6628560","6629900"," Oh, not OG's."
"6629940","6631780"," OG's like the creators of Wall Street. "
"6631880","6633480"," That came in and started slamming down people."
"6635100","6636300"," Taking out fucking."
"6637120","6641800"," I got an IP ban on I think 10, 10 accounts I had on Reddit. "
"6642400","6643860"," So I'm going back to the original."
"6645640","6647620"," Like the first year there was a, there was a Reddit."
"6647820","6649280"," I had one account that was a."
"6651380","6655820"," That was from the start of Reddit that they fucking took from me. "
"6656220","6657600"," I was fucking pissed about that man."
"6659100","6662800"," Like an original Reddit account from the first year and they fucking robbed me."
"6663100","6664280"," I was so fucking pissed. "
"6664280","6665620"," He knew who did that to me."
"6666020","6669400"," That was the moderator of."
"6670680","6671120"," Nicola. "
"6671620","6672400"," The Nicholas subreddit."
"6673520","6674720"," Fucking got me an IP band."
"6675140","6676020"," That's a fucking piss. "
"6677480","6678120"," Fuck Nicola."
"6686850","6687290"," Nah."
"6687970","6689090"," I don't know how they were doing it. "
"6689190","6689810"," It was an IP band."
"6689990","6691550"," I rebooted my computer, rebooted my."
"6693730","6695470"," I don't do IP address. "
"6695850","6696270"," It did matter."
"6696730","6698530"," I'm maybe I'm calling an IP ban."
"6698850","6700170"," They knew like I couldn't. "
"6700530","6700830"," I got."
"6701190","6705230"," So what they did was the first things they did was they started to delete my accounts, right?"
"6706550","6708310"," So I couldn't log back into them."
"6711810","6715750"," And then when I tried to sign up for an account, even with a new IP address, couldn't sign up"
"6715750","6717030"," for an account, I can now. "
"6717570","6720530"," But for about two or three years, I couldn't."
"6720950","6725430"," I don't know how they knew."
"6726090","6727430"," I don't know what tech they were using. "
"6736640","6737560"," It's not that weird."
"6738180","6740520"," You guys all know about how Reddit is, right?"
"6740720","6741240"," We're still like Reddit."
"6743000","6745580"," There is software out there to find out who you are. "
"6746800","6751740"," Even resources companies are figuring out by little bits of data that you leave behind trails that"
"6751740","6753200"," you leave behind who you are on Reddit."
"6754740","6755900"," It's like a fascinating place."
"6757280","6759560"," Or what it's turned into is a fascinating place. "
"6762670","6763290"," I don't know."
"6764530","6766890"," So what happened was they started to delete my accounts."
"6768750","6773450"," And then when I went back in to try to create a new account, I had a message pop right"
"6773450","6776430"," up and say, you know, accounts in this address. "
"6776850","6781570"," You know, else has this, you know, else has this tech is I just had I just had another."
"6783330","6785090"," It happened to me recently."
"6787290","6788130"," I'd use that. "
"6789690","6794150"," I'd use the like a free trial and then went back to get a free trial again."
"6794770","6796250"," It didn't matter what I did."
"6796350","6798490"," It didn't matter if I reboot my modem every morning. "
"6798830","6804510"," I like 4 a.m. My modem reboots because my wife is a work from home athletic trainer."
"6807630","6808830"," And I do this."
"6808830","6810730"," And so she's got this. "
"6813090","6815230"," She's got like a fucking big TV and shit."
"6815470","6817370"," And does all this stuff."
"6817590","6819090"," And she's in a VPN. "
"6820170","6822230"," You can internet VPN tunnel or something."
"6824670","6831770"," And so we'll reset every morning."
"6831970","6833490"," But matter of fact, I did a."
"6834650","6835990"," Like a seven day free trial. "
"6836270","6837510"," I tried to re sign up for it again."
"6837510","6839210"," And I couldn't."
"6839270","6841690"," And then I tried it under all kinds of different shit. "
"6841730","6843750"," I tried it on different different devices."
"6845210","6846490"," I tried it with a VPN."
"6847270","6850690"," And matter of fact, I had an email back from they said, we know who you are. "
"6850830","6851810"," And I was like, oh shit."
"6853730","6855170"," I actually got a physical email."
"6855590","6861270"," I said, I think I got through the second like the third or fourth attempt or something. "
"6861430","6861810"," I got through."
"6862570","6864050"," And then I got shut out of it."
"6864050","6865590"," And then they said, we know who you are. "
"6866250","6869010"," And they're like, uh, we have this IP address."
"6869010","6870250"," And I was like, you got to be shit me."
"6870370","6872130"," I was like, oh fuck, where's this. "
"6872550","6874550"," I'm assuming this tech is being sold to companies."
"6876430","6877270"," And it's just not."
"6878050","6879290"," It's just not talked about. "
"6883680","6884600"," Yeah, I clear cash."
"6884940","6885580"," I clear cookies."
"6886820","6887460"," I do all that shit. "
"6888340","6889120"," These VPNs."
"6889280","6890360"," I've decided VPN fails."
"6891860","6893180"," Everyone says VPNs work. "
"6893320","6894300"," I'm like, that's not always true."
"6895080","6895480"," Sorry."
"6897760","6899420"," So it looks like we're in consolidation today. "
"6899540","6900540"," I just want you guys to see this, right?"
"6900600","6902740"," Let's take a look at what's happening in the market."
"6903540","6904940"," Uh, and you can see it, right?"
"6905080","6905980"," You can see it on book map."
"6906220","6908160"," There's some consolidation for bouncing around. "
"6908740","6910220"," See the supply above, right?"
"6910360","6911900"," So if you look at my cursor up here."
"6912640","6914140"," And you're looking at the book map, right?"
"6914780","6917000"," You're saying there's there's supply here, right?"
"6917660","6919140"," So this is like that horse trading."
"6919600","6923780"," So you did says a few things you want to understand about what's happening today. "
"6924860","6927100"," Number one, we're in a supportive environment."
"6927840","6929700"," You like you write that down."
"6929840","6930340"," That's what it is. "
"6930460","6931400"," We're in a supportive environment."
"6932600","6934080"," And how you can tell, right?"
"6934500","6935460"," We're in a supportive environment."
"6935880","6938500"," Is the supply is coming in and we're not just bloodbath. "
"6938760","6939360"," Does that make sense?"
"6940660","6944420"," So when you hear people talk about sell the rip or buy the dip."
"6945520","6949080"," What it's telling you is we're not getting blood baths in the supply."
"6949280","6950240"," Do you see how you have supply here?"
"6951780","6954800"," We have buyers coming up on positive gamma right now. "
"6955640","6956120"," Right?"
"6956340","6959140"," We're not actually just bloodbathing it down, right?"
"6959240","6961600"," We're at down 300 fucking points today."
"6963840","6966320"," So when you hear people say we're in a supportive environment."
"6966960","6972060"," It's going to show that we're going to hit supply, come right back down and try to find some kind"
"6972060","6972420"," of stability. "
"6973880","6974500"," Where that is."
"6975120","6976340"," If this takes three days."
"6977180","6978300"," If this takes five days. "
"6978300","6981800"," You would then see us trade sideways and down."
"6982680","6983820"," Slowly over time."
"6984480","6986080"," Until we've found enough support. "
"6986780","6989100"," Enough buyers, more buyers than sellers."
"6989500","6989520"," Right?"
"6990280","6991040"," So you're seeing that."
"6991820","6995300"," So today if we had sold off right off the bell, we'd been like, fuck it. "
"6995340","6996440"," We would go to the depths of hell."
"6996920","7000620"," That would imply that that was a short covering."
"7001340","7001820"," Yesterday. "
"7002100","7002820"," That's all it was."
"7002820","7008520"," And you would see us immediately start selling the market in fucking mass right off the open or off"
"7008520","7009040"," the opening bell."
"7009040","7011740"," It'd be like a just a death and destruction. "
"7012780","7013900"," You'd be selling the rip."
"7015060","7017460"," We'd be down below this pinpoint as well."
"7018620","7020740"," So if you're a bull what you're looking for. "
"7022280","7027200"," If you're a bull out there, or if you're a bear and saying, I want to fucking sell this market,"
"7027560","7029280"," fuck you cap and fuck the bulls, right?"
"7030480","7033220"," You're looking for certain things over the coming days."
"7033960","7035180"," You're going to be looking for."
"7045540","7047400"," See if I can get this for you guys. "
"7052680","7053500"," Hold on here."
"7056900","7059340"," The people say, well, the market's digesting."
"7059780","7061140"," It's not really what's happening. "
"7061340","7062480"," You've got these sellers coming down."
"7062600","7064180"," You've got demand here."
"7065680","7069660"," And so just inside of this, just inside of this zone, I'm going to delete this in a minute, right?"
"7070540","7073560"," You're going to be looking for the supply coming down, right?"
"7073960","7075760"," All this horse trading taking place. "
"7076340","7082400"," And you're going to be looking for some kind of a consolidation in here until the supply is worn"
"7082400","7084520"," out, right?"
"7084740","7085480"," And then a move higher."
"7087220","7088780"," Here's that pivot point, right?"
"7089960","7095320"," And so you're going to be looking for some kind of, just some kind of consolidation in here."
"7096160","7100460"," Now, let's say we start to consolidate for like one, two, three days. "
"7101420","7105140"," And we start, we start consolidating for like four days or five days."
"7105840","7106640"," That's distribution."
"7108540","7109920"," He starts seeing distribution. "
"7111000","7112560"," You're going to be looking for weakness."
"7112980","7116340"," You're going to be looking for some kind of a bloodbath over here."
"7116580","7116900"," Make sense?"
"7120940","7123200"," So, and that's what we're experiencing today. "
"7123960","7125440"," Now, we could get a rip higher today."
"7125580","7127060"," We could just start blasting off once again."
"7128160","7131820"," But with this much volume, I'm going to be looking for some declining volume. "
"7132060","7133160"," You can see the volume here, right?"
"7133320","7134240"," You can see it right on this chart."
"7134520","7134980"," Look at this volume."
"7135600","7136600"," Volume here yesterday. "
"7137400","7138360"," Still volume here today."
"7138960","7141540"," A little bit more sellers than buyers, but still decent volume."
"7142280","7145820"," You'll be looking for some declining volume for that move higher as time goes on. "
"7147640","7149880"," Even this bar right here, that's 10 million, man."
"7149980","7150860"," That's fucking huge."
"7152140","7154780"," On a one hour chart, 10 million fucking huge. "
"7157020","7163200"," 19 million on the first hour of the day."
"7163580","7166700"," So you'd consider this positioning for the next move."
"7167300","7169100"," And what are we positioning for up or down?"
"7169560","7170560"," I can't tell you that right now. "
"7171200","7177220"," My thought is that we've got the gaps above the news yesterday is going to be an attack higher."
"7177780","7179200"," We're going to look to break out."
"7185150","7187130"," Here's where that downtrend is, right?"
"7189910","7190970"," Right over here. "
"7195240","7198500"," This is that bigger, larger bear trend."
"7199220","7203960"," You're looking for just some consolidation here and to start checking higher highs."
"7204780","7206620"," And this is likely where we're going. "
"7207340","7213180"," Unless we break below that pivot and we start to break below into negative gamma."
"7213840","7215000"," That's what we're doing right now."
"7217180","7225380"," And until that changes, until you break below this positive gamma over here, we start rolling it"
"7225380","7228780"," down and over, you can't be bearish here. "
"7230540","7231940"," So you're going to have to give it time."
"7232140","7236480"," You might see like you might see like day tomorrow and Monday consolidation."
"7237520","7238420"," There's a fair chance of that. "
"7238480","7240800"," It's probably a 35 to 45% chance."
"7241280","7243360"," You'll see consolidation today tomorrow and Monday."
"7243360","7247000"," Not guaranteed, but there's a high probability of that. "
"7248740","7251740"," Maybe some of you think that you'll wake up on Monday and it'll be a bloodbath."
"7251920","7252580"," It'll be way down here."
"7253100","7255300"," It's possible, but it's not probable. "
"7260440","7264600"," You're likely going to see consolidation here for an attempt at higher highs."
"7265440","7269420"," And the reason I say that is because you haven't had a reason all year long, not one time."
"7270460","7272560"," To make to attempt to make that move higher. "
"7273680","7274780"," We've got targets up here, right?"
"7274780","7279900"," We've got gaps to fill above and that kind of stuff."
"7280240","7282660"," So maybe they're asking like, hey, Cap, what do you think about this?"
"7282720","7283940"," And I'm like, okay, let's take a look."
"7284540","7291340"," We've got the end of month in the chat time when we got coming up to the economic. "
"7291780","7292200"," Not news."
"7292480","7292900"," How about events?"
"7293620","7296240"," We've got a December 16th, I think, right?"
"7296940","7297520"," Or 14th."
"7297740","7302410"," When is the actual the presser?"
"7302510","7303450"," Is that on the 14th, maybe?"
"7304230","7305150"," I haven't looked at a calendar yet. "
"7305150","7306070"," We don't need to."
"7306150","7308150"," We'll clean this up later."
"7309090","7311250"," The 14th and the 16th, we've got the Fed meeting, right?"
"7311490","7312670"," Does anybody know when the presser is?"
"7313510","7314290"," The 14th. "
"7314350","7315670"," That's something you want to be looking towards."
"7317030","7319650"," You've got end of the month, right?"
"7319890","7321990"," This is when the holiday rally usually begins."
"7323630","7324330"," It's usually the 15th. "
"7325250","7326310"," Historically, it's the middle of the month."
"7327610","7331770"," So we've got a 1230 right over there."
"7332350","7333350"," Some key points, right?"
"7335110","7338770"," So you kind of start thinking about, we're going to make this attempt now. "
"7339010","7340110"," We're going to make this attempt here."
"7341130","7343550"," Start thinking about how the market flows, right?"
"7344550","7346210"," We know all the market goes up."
"7346930","7348270"," We know the market comes down. "
"7349190","7350790"," We know the market comes up, right?"
"7351370","7351850"," See what I'm saying?"
"7353310","7355370"," Now, can we deviate from this plan right here?"
"7355590","7355750"," Sure."
"7356170","7356490"," We can."
"7359130","7360350"," We can deviate. "
"7360350","7366690"," But if we're going to start to think about, you know, just a simple way to think about the moves"
"7366690","7370090"," of the market, right?"
"7370190","7370490"," Makes sense?"
"7373420","7375700"," This is the 30th, so I guess you can move this around."
"7376000","7378880"," It could be something like this, right?"
"7379100","7380580"," So you get 1230 right here, right?"
"7380880","7383780"," So you're going to be like, okay, so now we might break this trend."
"7385140","7391780"," But if we trend like this in some fashion shape or form, if we trade down right here, and then"
"7391780","7394000"," jump right back on that gravy train, does that make sense?"
"7395100","7396040"," You consolidate in here. "
"7397560","7398740"," Jump right back on."
"7399680","7401380"," Get your rip higher that you're talking about."
"7403520","7404000"," Right. "
"7404180","7405860"," Seventh eighth coming into the 14th."
"7406260","7408260"," This is usually a bull thing, right?"
"7408520","7410220"," A monthly come back down."
"7411120","7412180"," Find some more support. "
"7413180","7413800"," 15th or so."
"7414360","7416220"," And a month coming to the 31st or so."
"7416680","7419300"," And we start selling, we start looking lower, right?"
"7419440","7422220"," We've now closed the gaps above, right?"
"7423020","7423680"," We've tagged our gaps. "
"7424800","7431940"," And now into January, you're going to see, let's just do a check again is what the market's going"
"7431940","7432400"," to say, right?"
"7433160","7435120"," And they're going to want to check that 350 level."
"7435680","7437640"," They're going to want to check, let's close this up."
"7438580","7442320"," They're going to want to check down here, right?"
"7445040","7446960"," So, let's see here. "
"7450220","7452160"," See this little gap down here that's filled?"
"7452960","7454940"," Remember that trend line that's over here, right?"
"7456080","7461060"," So to minimum, I got to delete all that close."
"7465080","7466440"," Let's move up here, right?"
"7466600","7467540"," Move up here, right?"
"7468460","7469080"," Move up here."
"7471680","7474120"," Hold on, my fucking thing sucks here. "
"7476380","7478460"," All right, move up at the end of the month or something."
"7479200","7479820"," Something like this."
"7479980","7480820"," Don't forget this wrong. "
"7481080","7481520"," Something like this."
"7483580","7484580"," Close the gaps above."
"7485960","7489480"," Coming to the 30th, and we're going to start one to check down lower, right?"
"7489880","7490900"," And where are we going to want to check?"
"7491080","7492400"," We're going to want to check down here, right?"
"7493740","7496100"," You can see this accumulation down here. "
"7498700","7499700"," Let me clear that out."
"7504430","7506990"," There's going to want to be a check down here."
"7507810","7509050"," See that gap down below?"
"7512200","7515440"," So they're going to want to check this coming into, let's call it January. "
"7517340","7518920"," Let's see, we get a bounce down here."
"7520160","7522380"," So you roll this over, come down, check it, right?"
"7522580","7525140"," We get a bounce, come back up, get some more rejection."
"7526500","7527660"," This is that major bear trend. "
"7528980","7532240"," Come back down to March and check lower one more time."
"7533260","7533960"," And then we're off and running."
"7534200","7537680"," I'm going to assume, too, this is going to be coinciding with the minutes. "
"7538300","7542600"," So you're going to be looking for the December Fed minutes whenever they come out, and you're going"
"7542600","7547140"," to tag that over here, put a vertical line wherever that is, and you're going to tag the minutes,"
"7547160","7551560"," whatever the minutes are expected in February and January, and the meetings as well, tag all those."
"7552060","7554140"," And you can probably chart a course where we're going."
"7555660","7558000"," Now, if you're like super bullish here, right?"
"7559300","7560980"," Where you want to get super bullish here?"
"7562660","7568000"," Then what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to look for these gaps to get"
"7568000","7568760"," closed, right?"
"7568960","7570740"," You're like, whoa, what about a super bullish cap?"
"7571480","7573680"," What about all-time highs with check and all that stuff?"
"7574120","7580000"," When we come up here and check these gaps, you'll want us to rest above, right?"
"7580260","7582980"," And solidate and start moving higher, right?"
"7583100","7584540"," So we'll deal with that when we get there. "
"7585000","7590020"," This would be the confirmation that we're changing directions, right?"
"7590540","7597340"," This whole sequence up here would confirm, even if we break down below here, and then start back up"
"7597340","7597600"," again."
"7598060","7601820"," This would be a confirmation that we've broken down trend, and we're attempting to go higher."
"7603480","7605040"," There's nobody out there with a crystal ball. "
"7605260","7606640"," There's no fucking alien wave out there."
"7606780","7608940"," There's no fucking, sorry, there just isn't."
"7609340","7612940"," That's going to tell you if we're going to do this or if we're going to go down here. "
"7613660","7618780"," But we're going to be looking for it as time, you know, this is your setups, your two setups into,"
"7619380","7624100"," your two highly probable setups in the January, February, March."
"7624660","7627980"," You're going to be looking for this kind of a setup and you're going to be looking for retesting"
"7627980","7629180"," down below as a setup."
"7629780","7634320"," Now, there's this third option which says we're going to crash the market anyways. "
"7635320","7638960"," Yeah, sure, but it's still a very low probability."
"7640300","7642100"," So if we see that, we'll come to it."
"7642180","7645380"," If you want to know how to see that coming, it doesn't really matter now, does it?"
"7645380","7652900"," Because if we, let's say we do the recheck down below, that path, oops, sorry, wait a minute. "
"7653200","7656160"," If we do this path down this way, somehow when I go off screen, it stops."
"7656640","7662120"," If we do this recheck down below, you can't get into crash mode unless we start breaking through"
"7662120","7664980"," these lower levels here on this downtrend."
"7665780","7669080"," So you can't even get into crash mode unless the check doesn't work over here. "
"7669780","7673780"," There's nobody out there that's going to tell you like it's going to fail or it's going to break."
"7673780","7678440"," I think it's going to break, you can say that, but you can't fucking, there's nothing guaranteed in"
"7678440","7678900"," this market."
"7679900","7680340"," Nothing. "
"7682970","7684170"," You have to know that."
"7684250","7688990"," There's just a list of probabilities, possibilities, how to react at those levels, what to look for"
"7688990","7692990"," at those levels, be ready for a bounce or a failure."
"7696340","7697680"," You guys understand all this stuff?"
"7698160","7705280"," I'm assuming about 50% of you do, 60% of you are probably already thinking about these moves into"
"7705280","7706580"," January, February, and March. "
"7706580","7709920"," But on your own charts at home, just start finding out, I haven't done it today."
"7710620","7714420"," So I have to do it for over the weekend for you guys so we can start looking at the"
"7714420","7715820"," possibilities for."
"7717780","7721780"," Specifically the rest of December, January, March and minutes, the meetings. "
"7722560","7723820"," They should be the key events."
"7724080","7731000"," But because of what Jay Paus said, you're going to look towards those known events as being the"
"7731000","7732440"," guide for the market."
"7733780","7741860"," You know, like bad news will be good news, mostly because they're going to be looking for the Fed"
"7741860","7742980"," guidance. "
"7743740","7748440"," If there's going to be a shift in guidance in the next few months, you're likely outside of unknown"
"7748440","7754560"," events, going to be trading to those those minutes and those speeches in a big way."
"7787460","7789080"," Some more sellers coming in right now."
"7791480","7795660"," Yeah, I don't like CPI and like those things are going to be. "
"7796140","7800840"," So you'd be used at certain points in the market like a resistance level or a support level."
"7801260","7804420"," If you guys looking for the major moves in the market, it's going to be fucking."
"7806900","7809640"," It's going to be all fucking eyes and all fucking ears on. "
"7811480","7813420"," The Fed has everybody's attention once again."
"7821780","7823960"," We're talking about AMC and it's fucking blasting off."
"7824140","7824900"," Do you guys want to look at AMC?"
"7835960","7836760"," Holy shit. "
"7839920","7842660"," Why don't we just talk about AMC like fucking 20 minutes ago?"
"7851240","7851640"," No."
"7852800","7854120"," Yeah, I don't think so."
"7854400","7856280"," Maybe intraday volatility from those guys. "
"7857400","7860500"," You're pretty much putting the clown hats on all those guys at this point."
"7862840","7864460"," Jerome threw a big dick down yesterday."
"7864680","7868820"," It's like, you know, listening to the fucking Fed heads now?"
"7869140","7869300"," No. "
"7870560","7872300"," I would call that a loss of credibility."
"7876120","7877680"," Slapped eight, nine, seven."
"7881220","7881700"," Jesus. "
"7883740","7884940"," Fucking, fucking AMC."
"7889660","7896300"," If it's any consideration, if it's any, uh, there are people out there that think that if, uh,"
"7896460","7899940"," there's a squeeze in AMC and GME, it coincides with market tops."
"7908860","7910000"," Give me a second here. "
"7910040","7910800"," I got some stuff for ya."
"7911220","7911960"," We'll put some stuff up."
"7912180","7912340"," Hold on. "
"7916100","7916820"," Just a second."
"7939310","7939710"," Yeah."
"7941610","7942150"," Hold on. "
"7942930","7944950"," Let's look at, uh, look at AMC."
"7944950","7950980"," I didn't know it was trading that way."
"7951060","7952480"," I haven't been watching AMC for some time. "
"7956240","7957020"," Ready for the pivot."
"7959300","7959920"," Right there."
"7961580","7962860"," That's the pivot point on AMC. "
"7972980","7974400"," Can't believe I'm doing this right now."
"7979350","7979810"," Got it."
"7979810","7981030"," Got to take care of the apes. "
"7983110","7984790"," Okay, pivot point 722."
"8011500","8012460"," Get down there."
"8014560","8015320"," Right there. "
"8026550","8047540"," Right there."
"8068850","8069610"," I got some more."
"8069770","8070350"," I got some cool stuff. "
"8070510","8076850"," I'll show you guys here in just"
"8088280","8093960"," a minute."
"8099770","8100490"," Jesus."
"8107200","8108640"," 1623. "
"8109380","8113260"," Right there."
"8118380","8120840"," You only get the bulls all crazy."
"8124040","8125060"," 1969. "
"8131250","8133130"," 1976, no."
"8134430","8136490"," 69 right there."
"8138270","8140250"," And then 23. "
"8142230","8142850"," 15."
"8148190","8149550"," Some upper targets here."
"8150570","8151590"," These are our retracements. "
"8171830","8172970"," See if we can go back."
"8173350","8175530"," Let me five minute trust with 15 minute chart."
"8181840","8183260"," Big power move down here. "
"8183540","8183920"," Five bucks."
"8185480","8186820"," Almost 100% move."
"8190700","8191660"," Consolidation, right?"
"8204000","8205500"," You measured this move. "
"8205780","8207180"," I don't know if I can measure on this or not."
"8208520","8217420"," I don't think I can, but I don't know."
"8217480","8219620"," I just do a rectangle or something like five bucks. "
"8234799","8236240"," About half the move right there, right?"
"8237160","8237860"," It's about half."
"8238320","8240200"," It seems like it's the top."
"8241840","8246059"," It seems like that's the top right there. "
"8247080","8247820"," About half the move."
"8252820","8254420"," Probably short this down if you wanted to."
"8278180","8279600"," It's kind of gross to say, isn't it?"
"8297309","8299430"," There you guys out there trading at AMC. "
"8300410","8300990"," Some dips to buy."
"8315719","8316820"," The move's probably done."
"8319340","8320400"," It's about half way up. "
"8326620","8331540"," If you say, if you're thinking, if you're like, it's not the move's not done cap."
"8331760","8331920"," Okay."
"8333360","8334480"," We know where. "
"8339860","8342320"," We know what to look for the move not to be done, right?"
"8349160","8350040"," Somewhere in there."
"8352200","8353340"," Is that it right there?"
"8353480","8354639"," Yeah, that's it."
"8354639","8355180"," That's it right about there. "
"8358059","8362020"," So if you're trading AMC, you want to stand this trend here."
"8363780","8368080"," You can see, you know, if you start, I mean, we can add them in too as it goes."
"8368400","8368799"," We can go. "
"8369900","8375040"," There's some, uh, some kind of a fake support right here."
"8375500","8376480"," Bullshit support right there."
"8377139","8378080"," We can write that in there too. "
"8378240","8378799"," Bullshit support."
"8383719","8384580"," Bullshit support."
"8388640","8390060"," You hope this buyers here. "
"8391120","8394060"," You can see what you can see view up."
"8398350","8400070"," You know, a few up starts coming down here."
"8400090","8401550"," You probably see a roll over. "
"8402530","8404450"," This would be a place of interest."
"8404450","8406870"," If you had VWOP, they could trade this right here too."
"8407830","8411130"," We're way outside of a moving. "
"8411130","8415750"," I guess if you use the seven day moving average, maybe you could trade that."
"8416750","8418150"," A five minute chart."
"8418450","8419690"," Yeah, we're way fucking far away. "
"8422430","8427510"," If you wanted to trade this, you know, you won't make this every time, but be looking for something"
"8427510","8428010"," like that."
"8428490","8431890"," Maybe you'd also be looking for a failure at some point."
"8432110","8434170"," So there's probably some trap buyers up in here. "
"8434750","8436450"," So you probably never get above there."
"8436650","8441650"," So you might today, but let's just, if you're looking at this as a pure exercise in trading."
"8442770","8446530"," This is where all the trap buyers are. "
"8450500","8451880"," I think it possibly get up here."
"8452580","8454920"," You possibly come up and test it one more time, right?"
"8455140","8458400"," A test if it rejects and trap buyers try to get out."
"8459220","8460540"," You'll start to see us make our way down. "
"8460960","8461620"," Not always."
"8462020","8462580"," There's a breakthrough."
"8463980","8465440"," But that's what you're looking for. "
"8465740","8469640"," So if you see like we come back up, retested, start trading down levels."
"8470320","8472400"," Your next level would be this is your next short."
"8472580","8473860"," Short right here would be right here. "
"8475100","8479700"," Take it to view up and then start to take it back down to these moving averages over here."
"8482220","8492100"," All bets would be off if once you"
"8492100","8493700"," break above the supply zone right here."
"8494940","8496940"," If you bring above the supply zone right here. "
"8498340","8499460"," You'll get your next leg."
"8502360","8503860"," So let's look at this on a."
"8508990","8511390"," So if you wanted to squeeze higher here, right?"
"8513690","8517190"," You want to start hitting the you want to hit 16, 16, 27?"
"8517410","8517850"," Believe it or not."
"8517950","8518430"," That's where it is. "
"8520710","8523390"," You want to start blasting higher and I haven't done a measure."
"8523570","8527050"," I don't have to measure some retracement, but that's there's so much."
"8527210","8530250"," I think that's where the retracement are like high lower retracement and stuff. "
"8530250","8539310"," So you're starting to see this breakdown below here already."
"8541710","8542770"," Start to see it, right?"
"8546440","8549500"," And where would you come in to look for buyers?"
"8551040","8552620"," Where is the demand line, right?"
"8552820","8555860"," This is the demand line or this was the demand line right here, right?"
"8556000","8557100"," There's a demand line right here."
"8558900","8562880"," And if people start panicking and selling, you start to see weakness here, right?"
"8563880","8565120"," They're like, just get me out of the trade. "
"8565260","8566020"," I don't want to be in the trade anymore."
"8566100","8567140"," I'm just getting out of the trade, right?"
"8567740","8569160"," Start bloodbath and it down here."
"8570680","8573040"," So you're going to have two places to check for demand. "
"8573320","8578020"," First place you're going to check for demand, of course, is view up right in here."
"8581150","8583530"," This is also a support level, I believe, is point of control."
"8585170","8585850"," That's our three. "
"8587630","8588830"," So this would be yellow."
"8592620","8593980"," And it's somewhere lower."
"8594240","8597580"," It's like, it actually goes kind of low, right there. "
"8602440","8606380"," And you got a gap to fill down here, right below R2 is a gap."
"8616990","8618390"," The old gapper down here."
"8618750","8619390"," We'll write that in white. "
"8619490","8620290"," We're getting gap in here."
"8621510","8622770"," We'll check back and see how this does."
"8626600","8627720"," You got a gap right here. "
"8637480","8640420"," And then your real support is down here at our one and pivot point."
"8641580","8645640"," This is your, you can see where it starts right here, right?"
"8645820","8647200"," This is your origination point."
"8648620","8650500"," This is also your pivot point down here. "
"8651520","8652540"," So you're going to turn that green."
"8652740","8656300"," So if the trade's still on, if it's still like, hey, I'm fucking super bullish here."
"8657200","8659320"," For AMC, this is your trade setups. "
"8660620","8664840"," You're looking for anything above that red."
"8666380","8667920"," This is where you're going to break out."
"8667920","8678410"," So you'd write breakout and squeeze"
"8678410","8704380"," in anything"
"8704380","8705260"," below down here. "
"8706760","8707360"," Bloodbath."
"8709420","8711240"," Break of this down here, bloodbath."
"8719160","8726810"," I think below this pivot point, you start getting really negative. "
"8730550","8732410"," Or you zoom the fucking beatings."
"8734330","8736050"," Here you zoom the beatings down here."
"8737230","8740390"," And then you want to look back at whatever the prevailing trend is, right?"
"8741390","8742550"," So this is the bloodbath. "
"8743450","8744850"," This is where you would resume."
"8750080","8751020"," See that there?"
"8751820","8753840"," Guess how this works out for you?"
"8755000","8759540"," So you'd be looking for this resumption of down trend."
"8765050","8766990"," You always make these bigger on your own charts. "
"8769810","8774470"," But if you start coming out here, you'd expect or anticipate that, you know, more of this bullshit."
"8775210","8778350"," And we could chart all that down there if you wanted, or you can do that on your own."
"8784820","8789300"," We could have made that bigger, but for the intraday, that's where it's at. "
"8798410","8799650"," We'll come back and revisit this."
"8803120","8804820"," The old pump and dumps."
"8807540","8808800"," The old pump and dumps. "
"8809600","8822300"," There you go, there's"
"8822300","8822440"," AMC."
"8827770","8829210"," What do you guys want to do, Tesla next?"
"8829910","8830630"," What do you guys want to do?"
"8830930","8832090"," There's not much going on, is there?"
"8833890","8835710"," There's not a lot going on, is there?"
"8838210","8839130"," You guys want to Tesla?"
"8839410","8839910"," What do you guys want to do?"
"8844990","8847310"," There isn't a whole fuck of a lot going on today, is there?"
"8854690","8855430"," Consolidation, baby."
"8858830","8862430"," These meme stocks go along with the angles is a good way to ride without too much money. "
"8862670","8863050"," Tesla, please?"
"8863270","8863510"," Yeah, Tesla?"
"8865510","8866130"," How about this?"
"8866330","8867170"," If I do Tesla, right?"
"8868050","8872290"," If I do Tesla, I want you to go on Twitter and say, Hey, Captain James about to chart out"
"8872290","8875250"," Tesla for you, and tell you fucking what he thinks is going to happen."
"8875530","8876530"," You can go on there and rip his ass."
"8883590","8884990"," Apple is at the top of the daily channel. "
"8885290","8886330"," Abraham C is giving a heads up."
"8886790","8888450"," You want to take a, let's take a trip around the market."
"8888610","8888870"," How about that?"
"8888950","8889550"," You want to do that first?"
"8890190","8892870"," Take a trip around the market and see what's up in the market. "
"8893950","8895690"," And then we'll do Tesla, okay?"
"8896130","8896910"," So Tesla will be next."
"8898030","8900530"," Limit a weakness right now, some consolidation in the spy."
"8902030","8905450"," You can see this like coiling happening, coiling happening right now. "
"8906430","8908210"," She got a directional break at some point."
"8910170","8913090"," Some little liquidity breaks going on in the buy-in south side right now."
"8913370","8914270"," Quiet middle of the day. "
"8914770","8915970"," I don't know if it's been all the time is right now."
"8916150","8920270"," 11.49. We'll take a look around the market."
"8920410","8923190"," Then we're going to chart out Tesla for Tesla gang. "
"8923690","8925510"," Test the queue, test the bulls, test the bears."
"8925810","8926090"," Doesn't matter."
"8926290","8926770"," We'll check it out. "
"8928410","8929870"," Please like and subscribe these videos."
"8932670","8933990"," Yeah, please like and subscribe."
"8934610","8935530"," Go on Twitter or something. "
"8935670","8936890"," Tell me when we're going to chart it out in a few minutes."
"8937510","8939030"," We're going to take a quick trip around the market."
"8939250","8939910"," See what's going on. "
"8940790","8941910"," And then we'll do a Tesla."
"8942610","8945370"," I don't know why I have Peton up here."
"8945430","8947150"," I was making fun of Peton yesterday. "
"8948390","8950090"," Oh, Tesla."
"8951290","8952750"," We'll come right back to Tesla."
"8953950","8954650"," Look at that. "
"8954910","8955350"," NDX."
"8955770","8956210"," Geez."
"8957810","8958750"," Look at NDX. "
"8960690","8961590"," Like a dragon."
"8963710","8966890"," Like I was like, like, what are we going to call this?"
"8970220","8973940"," We're going to call this like the rooster tailed."
"8977040","8980000"," Open or open China, COVID dragon head. "
"8982180","8982780"," Right."
"8983280","8984100"," Head on him."
"8984860","8985760"," Some teeth. "
"8988140","8989460"," Nasty little head on him."
"8994380","8996260"," He wants those gaps above, right?"
"9001060","9001780"," Supportive, right?"
"9001940","9004540"," We got some support on on NDX."
"9006000","9007040"," There could be some. "
"9007320","9008280"," It looks like consolidation."
"9009240","9010820"," It doesn't look like anything else like."
"9015350","9016470"," It's certainly bullish. "
"9022790","9026830"," You might have some bears out there saying this is just a larger bear flag pattern."
"9026830","9028150"," It doesn't look like it to me."
"9030030","9031210"," This looks more like. "
"9032610","9033850"," It looks like to me."
"9034150","9034530"," You want to know."
"9043040","9047200"," You know, this looks like a part of a larger pattern of one, two, three. "
"9048960","9051540"," One, two, and three."
"9052960","9055860"," And some consolidation for a like higher to close these gaps."
"9056100","9056680"," I'll be honest with you. "
"9056680","9057240"," That's what it looks like."
"9062740","9064480"," So I'm going to put some targets up here."
"9065160","9067260"," I don't know how long this consolidation lasts, man. "
"9067380","9069060"," This could last a day last three days."
"9069920","9072220"," I don't know how long it's going to last now."
"9072300","9074840"," If it lasts longer than three days, you could see the role. "
"9075100","9076120"," So if you're bears, you could."
"9077720","9079660"," Take a case for us coming back down."
"9083300","9084100"," One, two. "
"9086000","9086940"," Three in the move higher."
"9088700","9089760"," Make a case for this."
"9090420","9092120"," I'm not anti this case right here. "
"9095880","9100400"," I'm not anti this, but so if you're looking for a buy zone, we know where it's at, right?"
"9101460","9102840"," It's actually higher now."
"9104920","9106680"," Oh, there's still this gap down below us."
"9106740","9107380"," We may make it larger. "
"9109580","9110620"," Put it all the way down here."
"9112220","9113500"," That's a green zone, right?"
"9113800","9116500"," Your price target above is you got two price targets above."
"9118920","9120080"," Close this gap here. "
"9124070","9124770"," That's your yellow."
"9129770","9130830"," Close this gap here."
"9131090","9134690"," I don't have the retracement on NDX right now, but I can get them at some point if you want. "
"9135830","9141270"," And we can actually put the retracement in and see where they line up for this stuff."
"9144840","9148900"," I'm not going to do that right now, but we're going to just take a trip around the market."
"9157570","9158850"," NDX looks like consolidation. "
"9160850","9164210"," I'm not going to call it weakness yet, or that's going to go fully down here."
"9164750","9166830"," I'm going to give it that three days to see if it consolidates."
"9168490","9170830"," If it starts to break lower, I'd be looking to buy below. "
"9171210","9172430"," I'd prefer to buy this, though."
"9172490","9173050"," I'll be honest with you."
"9173050","9173790"," I'd prefer to buy this. "
"9177100","9179100"," But that was some powerful shit yesterday."
"9179300","9181120"," I think you might be lucky if you get somewhere in here."
"9185690","9187650"," Currently, it's sitting at 12,000 in one. "
"9193180","9194540"," I'd be looking to buy."
"9197260","9198000"," 11,750."
"9200700","9202280"," I said I'd like to buy 11,750. "
"9207830","9210390"," We'll put a box there just as a check."
"9218810","9223970"," It's kind of like your, kind of like your, we remain bullish here."
"9224890","9227250"," We get bears for this move down below that red box. "
"9237900","9238620"," Chunk bonds."
"9240520","9241360"," Staying in trend."
"9273810","9277110"," I said that junk bonds in a larger time frame, interested in this. "
"9281080","9281580"," Buyers."
"9282120","9282620"," Buyers."
"9283080","9283540"," Buyers. "
"9283780","9286140"," One, two, and three power move up."
"9286360","9289200"," This is a larger move here in junk bonds."
"9290500","9292400"," This is a pretty big move right here, right?"
"9292600","9293680"," You see these buyers coming in?"
"9294000","9295180"," They slammed it up right here. "
"9295960","9297020"," I did it again right here."
"9298180","9301520"," And this is a lot of work down here."
"9311500","9313720"," A lot of work going on to get there. "
"9314780","9321320"," I think tight here."
"9324100","9325400"," Let me get rid of this white box."
"9338370","9340090"," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, volatility. "
"9353180","9354400"," It's a lot of work to get up there."
"9355260","9356660"," A whole lot of work to get up there."
"9357740","9359720"," Wouldn't shock me to see you spend a lot of time in here. "
"9362200","9363360"," It's been a lot of work in here."
"9366580","9369620"," A lot of work to be done to form a bottom here."
"9380540","9384320"," This is that, that, that, that downtrend. "
"9397940","9399380"," There's a lot of work in here, man."
"9399640","9400560"," Like this is not going to lie."
"9400940","9402820"," Like you're trying to break out a downtrend here. "
"9403380","9404960"," Usually this takes some fucking work."
"9405780","9409460"," Sometimes you get a squeeze higher, but then it fails somewhere."
"9410420","9411860"," Sometimes you get that squeeze higher. "
"9413420","9416780"," You get like that, that push up higher, that extension up higher."
"9417360","9419560"," Then I'll come back down and consolidate some more."
"9420160","9423380"," That could be the January to March trade somewhere in here. "
"9424620","9425880"," It's a pretty big time frame here."
"9429280","9430920"," Maybe I shouldn't go that high with it."
"9431140","9432440"," I should have it like more like this. "
"9434840","9436780"," With some gaps, consolidate into March."
"9443800","9447860"," H.Y.G. Gaps above, right?"
"9448160","9449080"," Buyers, buyers, buyers."
"9451140","9451900"," Same setup. "
"9452180","9453460"," No, I'm not going to chart this right now."
"9453460","9454120"," You can chart this on your own."
"9454140","9455620"," This is the same setup, basically. "
"9456540","9457260"," Same fucking setup."
"9458720","9465380"," That was J.N.K. VIX, we talked to you yesterday about reprising VIX."
"9467020","9473160"," I think we should look at that as possible. "
"9473920","9476380"," I wanted to see this in a larger time frame, the VIX."
"9481260","9482500"," We've done it before, right?"
"9483200","9484820"," We've traded the VIX down to lower lows."
"9485060","9485980"," We'll come back and look at this. "
"9486160","9487660"," This is an important thing to look at as well."
"9488940","9492500"," If there's a reprising of VIX, it could become important."
"9493480","9494640"," Start rolling this over. "
"9501140","9502720"," There is a point in here."
"9504780","9505480"," Right there."
"9509280","9510620"," No, that's not it either. "
"9511480","9513940"," Is it right here?"
"9515560","9516800"," Hang tight for a second."
"9519580","9520800"," It's somewhere in here."
"9521220","9522320"," I don't know where it is right now. "
"9522500","9523320"," Maybe we haven't hit it yet."
"9524440","9525200"," Maybe that's why."
"9536210","9537350"," We're going to be looking for this. "
"9538850","9542670"," I don't know if this happens or not, but I was talking about this with you yesterday."
"9542670","9544270"," Some of you all stayed in stream with me."
"9546750","9548490"," There's no guarantee this happens. "
"9549190","9550630"," You're going to be looking for a VIX."
"9555050","9556190"," Some kind of reprising."
"9561210","9563590"," We know we have a marker down here at 1410. "
"9566410","9567930"," You want to get really nasty."
"9568190","9569090"," I don't think it ever gets this low."
"9571690","9574470"," If we trade in here, that would be fascinating. "
"9574830","9580010"," That would put us back to December 31st right here."
"9580570","9582430"," This is going to be a key point right here too."
"9583230","9584490"," We'll keep this one on here as well. "
"9584770","9589190"," This is a key level down below."
"9592910","9594150"," We'll watch this in a march."
"9598890","9601110"," You can see there's more to go down here. "
"9601150","9602510"," This is that little push right here."
"9602610","9604770"," My key is you could actually come down here."
"9605670","9608270"," You could trade it to $18 in a reprising event. "
"9608430","9615050"," If we had a push above outside of the channel, you could see VIX got 18 bucks and you could"
"9615050","9616470"," see reprising."
"9617110","9620350"," A trend reversal confirmation on the VIX."
"9621750","9623370"," You get weakened to January and March. "
"9623590","9626110"," They have another top to sell up here."
"9627650","9628610"," This is January."
"9630130","9630990"," This is March. "
"9633610","9636530"," We'll pay attention to this as time goes forward and see what happens."
"9642240","9643480"," Where does this put us?"
"9644680","9646080"," Probably June or July, right?"
"9646080","9646620"," I don't know."
"9646740","9648440"," You may have like the user that should be. "
"9649080","9649680"," This is May."
"9654110","9656270"," This is April 27th."
"9656650","9661310"," I don't know if we get there, but April 27th. "
"9661710","9662150"," Let's mark it."
"9662850","9663370"," That's what happens."
"9667200","9669520"," Can't wait to come back on April 27th and see where we are. "
"9670980","9672300"," For way of the other way or not."
"9676090","9682870"," This would be the December rollover."
"9683790","9688490"," So you would expect us in April to be at nint ready all-time highs. "
"9689590","9696050"," Oh, that's got to piss some people off."
"9702910","9705010"," You get some work to do both bears."
"9705650","9706930"," Bears need to get those shit together. "
"9712080","9714600"," Bears get some work to do."
"9715960","9717900"," Do we already look at the Dixie?"
"9719480","9721960"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"9723320","9724280"," What's that?"
"9726940","9728340"," What's that right there?"
"9731040","9732540"," Someone's lost their pants. "
"9734480","9735480"," Blood red."
"9738240","9739360"," Blood red."
"9741340","9743600"," Somebody get tornado sirens out. "
"9744480","9746260"," That's some blood registered right there."
"9747460","9750340"," Let's look at some possible support places."
"9751180","9751760"," They're right here. "
"9751880","9753040"," We already had this one here."
"9753160","9754120"," We'll drop boxes here."
"9755300","9756500"," You guys might like drop boxes. "
"9757080","9758820"," Places of interest for Dixie."
"9761900","9762860"," For the Dixie."
"9763180","9763660"," Push here. "
"9764960","9765940"," Push there."
"9769060","9770160"," Maybe not boxes."
"9770420","9770880"," I don't like that. "
"9774420","9776560"," This is an interesting level."
"9779340","9780920"," Probably have to do some work on this shit."
"9782100","9783740"," Push right by. "
"9784760","9785780"," Then a thrust up."
"9787220","9789520"," So you're going to be looking for some buyers down here."
"9789800","9798980"," I mean, it's most certainly the most certainly you're going to be looking for some buyers down"
"9798980","9799180"," here. "
"9800380","9804050"," Let's see if we got this right here."
"9804350","9805110"," Right in here."
"9807510","9808350"," Right in there. "
"9810590","9811910"," Push right there, right?"
"9812490","9813410"," Push right there."
"9815290","9816130"," Maybe it's lower."
"9818950","9819770"," Right in here. "
"9824500","9826400"," Let's see if these buyers step in down here."
"9831690","9833570"," It's very fucking bearish on Dixie though."
"9837010","9839570"," It's very bearish on Dixie right now. "
"9840830","9842310"," You should see more bloodletting."
"9848060","9849260"," Price target $101."
"9851460","9852600"," It's pretty fucking brutal. "
"9852920","9856800"," If that happens, fucking you're going to see a melt up and you'll see a fucking melt up in the"
"9856800","9856880"," market."
"9857000","9860160"," I don't think we get down here, but you'll see the market just melt."
"9861060","9862000"," It'll be fucking stupid. "
"9862000","9864880"," I don't know if we get down here."
"9866420","9875020"," On a smart time frame, the fucking, the bulls need to say we're not going to get down there."
"9875160","9881720"," We're already down below, you know, $104.67. We're not that far away. "
"9882060","9882560"," Does that make sense?"
"9883120","9893050"," So this is actually, this is bullish on the dollar, believe it or"
"9893050","9893210"," not."
"9893210","9894530"," It looks bullish."
"9905450","9907470"," We'll see if it keeps going down here or not. "
"9907790","9908590"," It keeps trending down."
"9909810","9910610"," Pay attention to this."
"9910710","9911950"," This is an important thing to pay attention to. "
"9916680","9918520"," Some pretty nasty shit right there."
"9919480","9920680"," The violent moves down, right?"
"9921540","9924560"," If you had a dollar crash, you could have like just trying green bars for like a fucking week."
"9927800","9929600"," We just have fucking green bars every day. "
"9929860","9931160"," So we're going to watch this down here."
"9941030","9942610"," I had a rejection here, right?"
"9942790","9945270"," You can see like the buyers stepped in right here."
"9946850","9951610"," The buyers came in and the sell was just boom down below. "
"9953290","9957890"," It means that dollar bulls have to go lower to see where real support is."
"9958110","9961090"," They're going to check it all the way down until they do find some support."
"9962670","9964410"," Very bearish right now in the dollar. "
"9964950","9966410"," Overall, very bearish."
"9966950","9967750"," You can see right here."
"9967750","9971170"," You can see right here that the buyer is lost. "
"9972330","9974870"," They won right here, but they lost right just right here."
"9974950","9975190"," They lost."
"9976890","9980410"," So we're going to check lower lows for more support. "
"9983420","9985260"," I'm bullish on the market right now just from this."
"9987660","9989220"," Let's look back in time and see."
"9994310","9995270"," Let's have a trend. "
"9998350","9999370"," Hold on here."
"9999610","10000670"," I'm interested in this now."
"10000670","10002750"," Oh, shit. "
"10006680","10007840"," Did I just fuck that up?"
"10008140","10008620"," Yeah, I did."
"10013870","10015510"," That's some vicious shit right there."
"10026570","10027890"," God damn, look at that. "
"10032920","10037800"," You know, there's some telling you that there's something fucking wrong in Denmark, right?"
"10038180","10039980"," There's some telling you something fucking wrong in Denmark."
"10041040","10045160"," So, look at that giant gap down here to fill."
"10047360","10048340"," Break of the 200. "
"10049260","10050540"," Not a good look."
"10053120","10054080"," Where is this gap?"
"10054560","10055880"," This is December back in here."
"10058900","10060780"," Time out some major moves down. "
"10063840","10065960"," That's showing all-time highs down here."
"10066520","10071340"," Let me get out your back to your all-time highs right here."
"10073620","10074940"," So let's look, right?"
"10075360","10076600"," We have the initial pushup, right?"
"10076600","10079320"," These are the initial buyers down here. "
"10080820","10084260"," Or was the dollar bulls were in here somewhere."
"10089610","10090530"," They pushed up."
"10091630","10094690"," They found this is the second group of buyers that came in right here. "
"10099630","10099870"," Right?"
"10100170","10101150"," And then they pushed it up again."
"10102370","10104270"," We had a third group that came in here, right?"
"10105310","10107950"," They pushed it up and came down and they found some more buyers right here."
"10109030","10109470"," Right?"
"10110410","10111490"," Look at this right about. "
"10114470","10115170"," Right in here."
"10119950","10121270"," That's this group right here."
"10126220","10128880"," See, this is this group, this group bought it, pushed it up. "
"10129600","10131040"," Through some more money and it pushed it up."
"10132260","10133640"," Came back down for some consolidation."
"10135320","10136840"," Pushed up enough so they weren't there, were they?"
"10139460","10140140"," They were lower. "
"10143900","10144740"," They're right in here."
"10148090","10149390"," She has a target down below."
"10151130","10153010"," This group's getting busted up right now. "
"10154310","10157870"," Whoever this group is right here, they're getting demolished right now."
"10158750","10161010"," Whoever this group of buyers was, they're getting wrecked."
"10164780","10167180"," If this breaks down here, right?"
"10168600","10170520"," This is your next price target down below. "
"10174080","10177320"," This is this group's getting destroyed, getting just chewed up right now."
"10190190","10197190"," If you want to be bullish on the market, you want to see, you know, some kind of a failure"
"10197190","10197470"," here."
"10198310","10199430"," You can see this come up. "
"10199970","10201470"," This is six to four PM."
"10203550","10208690"," If you see the markets get stay weak into the close right now and then you're going to be looking"
"10208690","10210890"," for a rejection to resume an upward."
"10212470","10214770"," You want to see this resumption for a move higher. "
"10215290","10218870"," If we break above here, this is actually a better take."
"10219110","10222550"," If you're a bull, this is a better entry for you."
"10223090","10224490"," This is another entry for bulls. "
"10225150","10226370"," Take along in the market."
"10227370","10235190"," So let's call it at $1.50. Put an alert on your trading software at $1.5.14. We look"
"10235190","10237410"," at you guys and targets."
"10238770","10240430"," Set an alert on your own trading software. "
"10241330","10242170"," You want to take a bullish trade?"
"10244650","10253630"," It's probably somewhere there at $1.5.27 and then your next target for"
"10253630","10263470"," a safer bullish move, $1.05.88. So your bull, you're looking to"
"10263470","10264610"," take a trade long."
"10264890","10266290"," You'd wait for up here for a rejection."
"10267710","10268470"," That's your first chance. "
"10271410","10276190"," If you, you know, stops because you see the dollar consolidate here and starts moving higher."
"10277650","10280990"," This is where you'd want to be taking your next trade as a bull."
"10285000","10287140"," So I'm bearish into the close right now. "
"10288380","10290160"," Let's go back and look at Spyro."
"10290260","10292780"," Then we'll do the Tesla."
"10294740","10296080"," I want to take one more look at Spy. "
"10296700","10297740"," It's already bleeding off."
"10299340","10301260"," So I'm going to give you a price target for the end of the day."
"10301880","10303240"," Pretty, pretty easy to do, I think. "
"10304520","10306240"," Just by looking around the markets, pretty easy."
"10306560","10309040"," Not easy, but I'm going to give you a price target at the end of the day."
"10309520","10311340"," I'm going to expect consolidation in the close. "
"10312180","10315280"," I'm going to look for a week close today."
"10316920","10325100"," Down to the pivot price target by end of the day, $4.296. Maybe $4.120 by end of the"
"10325100","10325240"," day."
"10325320","10326080"," I'm going to look for that right there. "
"10326080","10328560"," I'm going to look for strengthen the dollar into the end of the day, at least."
"10329360","10333800"," And I'm going to look for, you're going to set an alert on your Dixie chart for those two places."
"10334660","10337300"," And you're going to see how that corresponds to where we are in the market. "
"10338480","10342500"," Where is Dixie in relevance to where the pivot point is and where S1 is?"
"10347090","10351270"," I'm going to expect Dixie to strengthen at least intraday today, in the end of the day."
"10352790","10353910"," So just more consolidation."
"10354770","10357770"," At least one more day of consolidation, maybe two, maybe three. "
"10359090","10360150"," Maybe three in a Friday."
"10360790","10362510"," That was fairly easy to look at."
"10362590","10364450"," It's not, that isn't really fucking rocket science, right?"
"10364670","10365110"," It's pretty simple. "
"10366370","10369730"," I'm going to give that, I'm going to give that high probability trade."
"10375710","10379270"," High probability trade that we're going to do some consolidation in here."
"10380070","10381390"," Some low targets you've got. "
"10382150","10390770"," I would use these targets against Dixie, $4.296. 40121, 398, 46."
"10391270","10394190"," You can pause the program and go back and listen to those call outs."
"10395130","10396370"," Can we bounce here and go higher?"
"10396650","10396790"," Sure. "
"10397210","10400390"," You see a failure in Dixie."
"10402310","10403190"," Yeah, we can go higher."
"10404110","10407430"," I don't see this as being, in my view, this is not bearish. "
"10407750","10410590"," This is just, I mean, if we trade down here, this is still bullish."
"10412350","10414630"," In a bullish environment, trading down to S1."
"10414970","10417170"," The other point, getting a nice bounce. "
"10417570","10421370"," If this takes a day or two, I think it's still bullish context."
"10422830","10425370"," If any news comes into the market, that's bullish."
"10426110","10428130"," You will see a bounce before you ever get down here. "
"10429330","10431930"," So things can change as news, news break, news events break."
"10435980","10437040"," We'll look at Tesla next."
"10437300","10438260"," We're going to do Tesla right now. "
"10446170","10447170"," Yeah, we'll do next."
"10447370","10450170"," We'll do Tesla and then probably going to take a break for the rest of the day."
"10450770","10453130"," I think it's going to be weak into the, into the bell. "
"10453590","10455010"," So I'll leave the stream up, of course."
"10455170","10456070"," I'll do Tesla for you guys."
"10456350","10458510"," Because I test the guys want to know what's up. "
"10458950","10460890"," Back to like the same shit as yesterday, right?"
"10463230","10463610"," And Tesla."
"10465830","10467050"," Tesla was really cool yesterday."
"10467590","10469430"," You had this up down, no decision. "
"10469790","10471310"," If we did, if we didn't know this was really cool yesterday, this was here."
"10471450","10472570"," We didn't know that this move was made."
"10473050","10474230"," We're talking about this yesterday. "
"10475210","10477410"," Someone had asked, all right, but it asked a bunch in stream."
"10477930","10479470"," Hey, Cap, this looks like it's going up."
"10479630","10480610"," I was told yesterday. "
"10484250","10486130"," So let's pretend we didn't know this was here, right?"
"10486270","10487350"," It's probably didn't know this move was here."
"10487810","10491110"," And just by looking at this yesterday, my point yesterday was we're at the pivot."
"10491330","10492090"," See the pivot right there?"
"10492870","10495390"," And we're trading above it, trading below it, trading above it, trading above it. "
"10495450","10496230"," We're coiling, right?"
"10496510","10498330"," For a move either higher or lower."
"10499270","10501110"," And we wound up getting the move higher yesterday."
"10502090","10504090"," But I was asked, why aren't you long here, Cap?"
"10504350","10507170"," And I was like, well, I want to see first what the decision is in the Fed. "
"10507570","10513050"," Now, if you know what to expect off of the Fed, Fed mouthpiece talking, then you can enter this"
"10513050","10514810"," position anytime and trade it up higher, right?"
"10515850","10520790"," So if you were tuning in with us yesterday in the Fed, you need to take tech long out of"
"10520790","10523890"," the Fed speaker out of a J-POW."
"10525430","10526550"," Let me get some coffee real quick."
"10534310","10535230"," And the move was higher. "
"10535490","10542750"," But as a trader or as an investor, my point is that if you start to make these trades like"
"10542750","10546330"," this where you don't know the direct, where you don't have anything to tell you the direction, when"
"10546330","10550950"," it's directionless, you try that trade seven or ten times, you're probably going to lose seven out"
"10550950","10551530"," of ten times."
"10551990","10554550"," You might even, let's say you only lose four out of ten times."
"10554930","10561010"," If you guys know the ratios on win ratios, you could have three trades, it's four trades that only"
"10561010","10562030"," hit 30, 40%. "
"10562030","10562970"," It's not good enough."
"10563570","10568030"," You have to have like high, you have to have like three to four, 100% plus wins."
"10568910","10576710"," You have to have another mix of like four to, four to five to six, 20, 30% wins and"
"10576710","10577650"," only one or two losses. "
"10578390","10580810"," So if you had to run this gamble every day, you wouldn't win."
"10581190","10581670"," Does that make sense?"
"10582410","10585370"," You guys have to look at your, there's a lot of new traders here."
"10585730","10588770"," And I want you to start thinking about every ten trades, how much you're making. "
"10589150","10591170"," Go back and look at your last ten trades."
"10592150","10594010"," If you've got a larger sampling, 100 trades."
"10594530","10597270"," I want you to look at them for like a hundred, ten trades, a hundred trades. "
"10598130","10601870"," And I want you to start looking at your win to loss ratio, your percentage that you're making."
"10602790","10607170"," So if you have a 20, 30% win, it's okay, but you're paying taxes on that money, right?"
"10607650","10609490"," And then let's see, you have a string of a lot."
"10609710","10610910"," So I used to trade the wheel, right?"
"10611150","10615670"," You have like a, you have a wheel strategy where you're making like a high rate of success. "
"10616810","10618150"," I'm winning nine trades."
"10619730","10622630"," But I'm only winning for 20, 30% and I've got that one loser."
"10623890","10624930"," And then I'm paying taxes. "
"10625790","10628670"," So at the end, you're like, shit, I just made 7% or 10%."
"10629210","10633070"," I didn't have, it didn't really pay off as I expected for all that work that I did."
"10634010","10637090"," So I want you to look back on, if you're a new trader in this room right now or this"
"10637090","10639590"," YouTube thing, I want to go back and just spend time. "
"10639790","10644290"," Do the work on your own trading and look at your win percentage."
"10644290","10648090"," When you're losing how bad of the loss is, is it 100% loss?"
"10648390","10652470"," Am I only losing, you know, if I, let's say going for a dollar and I only lost 10 cents"
"10652470","10656790"," on that trade, how many of those trades that I have to get or take so that you get that"
"10656790","10660170"," one to three, 100% to 300% winner?"
"10660490","10665170"," You want to start looking at those ratios and making sure that you're winning enough that you're"
"10665170","10666110"," not blowing up accounts."
"10666810","10667630"," You'll hear this often, right?"
"10667710","10668730"," People say I blew up my accounts. "
"10668730","10674330"," Like, all right, can't ever seem to get above $1,000 or $20,000 or I'm stuck in this PDT"
"10674330","10675650"," craziness."
"10676930","10683210"," And though you'll see them come into a stream or a Twitter or Wall Street bets or a fucking stock"
"10683210","10687310"," twits and they'll, you know, point their finger up like Babe Ruth and say it's going that way."
"10687830","10690190"," Then the moment that it doesn't, the other seven times, they disappear. "
"10691310","10697750"," And so they're not there for you to, they're not there and you're not checking on them to say, hey,"
"10697750","10701150"," man, those seven other fucking times you sucked, right?"
"10701310","10703310"," They just kind of disappear and hide in the back."
"10705670","10711450"," When you really want, you'll find out over time when you meet traders, you'll find out that the"
"10711450","10716470"," best traders, the best investors, especially in this situation yesterday will tell you, fuck no."
"10717990","10718730"," Fuck no. "
"10718970","10720750"," Like, I need to hear this guy speak."
"10722150","10727990"," And you want to hear these people speak or this event happen or this data to come out for these"
"10727990","10728530"," kind of moves."
"10729030","10729730"," Okay, be be conscious. "
"10729970","10734910"," I want you guys to really think about that because I'm telling you'll see these people disappear."
"10735590","10738250"," Sometimes on highs, I'll get an email from people."
"10738510","10740450"," Dude, I don't ever call these people. "
"10740570","10741450"," I'll get an email from people."
"10742230","10744490"," Like, I just bought Tesla at fucking 1500 bucks, bro."
"10744650","10745250"," Go fuck a dick. "
"10746010","10747270"," Suck my balls, bro."
"10747390","10750730"," Look what I did."
"10752050","10753450"," Those people are gone. "
"10753810","10754550"," They fucking disappear."
"10756090","10761350"," Fucking abandoned Twitter accounts, abandoned fucking stock clicking accounts, abandoned fucking"
"10761350","10762430"," Wall Street bets accounts."
"10762830","10764570"," They come back under a different fucking username. "
"10765530","10767130"," I'm telling you, this is the truth."
"10768150","10768910"," Telling you."
"10769490","10772190"," This goes for bulls and bears, all retail traders. "
"10772630","10778270"," So I want you guys to know that that's not the way to trade."
"10778990","10779950"," I promise you."
"10780330","10781230"," Maybe one hit. "
"10781450","10783250"," You're like, I need to get this one fucking thing."
"10783590","10784570"," You might work for some guys."
"10784650","10786910"," It's got like a thousand bucks and he goes to work every week. "
"10787410","10790930"," He's just going to keep fucking doing it until he can build a bank on one trade."
"10791250","10791830"," I get that."
"10791950","10792530"," I respect that. "
"10792890","10794230"," You want to do that to build an account?"
"10794390","10795310"," I've seen guys do that."
"10795850","10797130"," I've seen guys like have a job."
"10797290","10798050"," Go to job come in. "
"10798210","10798450"," We're weak."
"10798690","10800690"," Slam down your 500 bucks on a one out of 50 trade."
"10801270","10803950"," And it finally fucking hits and you're back in business. "
"10804870","10808890"," But then you get back into that fucking, you know, you slammed it down 500 bucks."
"10808890","10811910"," You made 20 grand 30 grand and then you're right back into it."
"10811970","10814650"," I can hit this shit again and I'm going to make it to turn to $100,000. "
"10815550","10817570"," Eventually after 10 trades, it's gone again."
"10817970","10824430"," So telling you, telling you that that happens to like fucking 70% of your traders."
"10825250","10826670"," 70 like that high. "
"10828530","10830130"," So let's look at Tesla."
"10834060","10836380"," This is that this is real hard knowledge."
"10836380","10836780"," Okay. "
"10837160","10840320"," I'm telling you guys out there you're a new fucking trader investor."
"10841360","10844820"," You write that shit or imprint that in the back of your fucking brain."
"10846160","10847560"," And eventually you'll get it. "
"10848920","10851100"," And there are better ways to build an account than that way."
"10851240","10853060"," But I know that people try to build accounts that way."
"10853880","10854280"," Okay. "
"10857160","10858500"," We got our pivot line, right?"
"10858660","10860540"," Our pivot today is going to be 190."
"10861320","10861900"," We're going higher."
"10862120","10862500"," This is nice. "
"10862760","10863480"," You want to see this."
"10864960","10866460"," Or you want to know we're bullish on Tesla."
"10867160","10867980"," Yes, we are. "
"10871350","10873010"," Yes, we are bullish on Tesla."
"10873510","10876870"," The pivot point is 190.03. So right down here."
"10883000","10884760"," And it's good that it's green, right?"
"10885320","10886760"," This is your pivot point right here. "
"10887480","10889700"," Maybe we'll make this, uh, we should make this yellow."
"10889700","10890280"," I don't know."
"10890660","10891540"," This is Tesla gang. "
"10891720","10893200"," So there's your pivot point."
"10896340","10897840"," I love me some Tesla gang."
"10899240","10900560"," Uh, hold on here. "
"10901080","10903300"," I know some, I think he hates Tesla."
"10903840","10904360"," All right."
"10904480","10906820"," We have a lot of guys in here that hate fucking Tesla too. "
"10906820","10908560"," So I can't say fucking."
"10909800","10911180"," I'm surprised that they get along."
"10911420","10916200"," That's the one of the qualities of our group is that you've got people that fucking hate Tesla. "
"10916720","10920740"," And they still are friendly with people that love Tesla."
"10921240","10926020"," And I like seeing that because they really do still try to help each other out."
"10929020","10931460"," Um, and you guys will see me at the same time. "
"10931460","10934680"," You guys know that I'll come in and be like, I'm bearish on Tesla right now."
"10935020","10936980"," I have to be a realist when it comes to Tesla."
"10937480","10938560"," I love the stock. "
"10939280","10940220"," Love trading it."
"10943240","10947020"," Um, but, but I'm a realist when it comes to when to buy Tesla when not to buy Tesla."
"10947380","10948640"," And I don't need to fucking buy. "
"10948920","10949600"," I'll show you this too."
"10950100","10952280"," I don't fucking need to buy Tesla way down here."
"10952660","10955140"," Oh, we did buy Tesla way down here to be honest with you. "
"10955420","10956420"," This is where we bought Tesla."
"10956640","10958540"," This is where we called out by Tesla right fucking now."
"10959580","10961140"," Uh, so yeah, did we catch the bottom?"
"10961440","10961680"," We did. "
"10966700","10967100"," So."
"10967100","10970640"," So a whole lot here, but we're coiling like this."
"10970920","10975580"," Yeah, because it's just as much fucking torch the market yesterday. "
"10976400","10977920"," Uh, so we got a pivot line here."
"10979200","10980840"," So take your money and run as my point."
"10981100","10984000"," 185 30 is the next one. "
"10987460","10987900"," Right."
"10988180","10990400"," Take your money and run, especially in a bear market."
"10991680","10992840"," We got going on back. "
"10993000","10994040"," This is all this looks like dog shit."
"10994100","10994500"," Look at this."
"10994920","10995680"," Come on now. "
"11003500","11004220"," Right there."
"11005300","11006100"," Range expansion."
"11006580","11007200"," We talked about this. "
"11007400","11007500"," Right."
"11007720","11008820"," S one down below here."
"11009180","11010740"," It's a pretty big move down here. "
"11010840","11012240"," This is where fortunes are made and lost."
"11021180","11021580"," Wow."
"11031090","11032970"," Might as well just leave that in where it is. "
"11034590","11035210"," Right there."
"11035390","11035890"," That's us too."
"11036250","11037230"," Way down there. "
"11040710","11042650"," Well, I have a good question for you guys."
"11042810","11043510"," If you're Tesla gang."
"11046950","11049290"," One 71 17. "
"11051630","11053490"," Got a good one for you if you're Tesla gang."
"11054890","11056150"," Well, look at this really fast."
"11056430","11057630"," How many of your Tesla gang. "
"11065480","11067140"," So 185 30, right?"
"11067440","11068720"," Look at S one S two S three."
"11068780","11070200"," Forget about these resistance levels."
"11070800","11072000"," How many of your Tesla gang. "
"11073420","11076280"," Uh, didn't buy fucking calls until today and think."
"11077240","11079080"," And didn't look to see if."
"11081460","11085200"," If your calls could take this pain down here and still it. "
"11085440","11086880"," We'd still be bullish if that's three."
"11087440","11089660"," Could your calls take that pain down here?"
"11089800","11090760"," One 71 7 24."
"11091140","11091360"," Nope. "
"11091640","11093120"," I guarantee most of you couldn't."
"11094060","11096620"," Guarantee I guarantee like fucking 70% of you couldn't."
"11098220","11099520"," I'm not saying we're trading down. "
"11099600","11100240"," I'm just saying that."
"11100680","11101660"," Did you even consider that?"
"11101820","11102200"," Probably not."
"11103080","11104320"," It was I'm going to bet. "
"11105400","11106360"," Come on here."
"11108000","11109200"," We got some range expansion."
"11111840","11115480"," We got a one 99 43. "
"11119220","11120300"," Somewhere in there."
"11121600","11122380"," That's our one."
"11124940","11125620"," Right. "
"11134280","11136440"," Two or four 16 or two."
"11139360","11143120"," I'll give the bulls some, uh, some upper targets if they really want them."
"11148100","11150420"," You want that you want those big boys up above?"
"11150580","11152580"," You want to see a trend change and where it goes?"
"11153380","11154220"," There's our three. "
"11154680","11155800"," There's a lot of room, right?"
"11156220","11157600"," It's a lot of fucking room right there."
"11160660","11162240"," Pretty big range right there, right?"
"11167760","11169040"," Pretty giant range."
"11173260","11176580"," Um, I'd be looking to use moving averages here. "
"11177540","11178480"," And VWAP."
"11179160","11182000"," Or below VWAP right now, but I'd be liking to see something like this."
"11182920","11184260"," Does it have you looking for?"
"11186460","11188300"," Caught the jump down here, right?"
"11189340","11191020"," Some consolidation move higher. "
"11192440","11193800"," Looking for something similar."
"11193800","11196620"," I'd like to buy S1 on Tesla."
"11197020","11197780"," Be honest with you. "
"11198000","11199160"," I'd like to buy like 185."
"11200460","11201980"," Or to make another, another empire."
"11202400","11205120"," I have a price target of like two 13 off one one one eighty five. "
"11205460","11205940"," I like that."
"11206740","11207540"," Something like that."
"11208580","11209100"," Two 13. "
"11210540","11211500"," I like that."
"11211700","11213000"," I like that for Thanksgiving."
"11213420","11214520"," You want some upper targets for it?"
"11214640","11215800"," Not Thanksgiving, but holiday rally. "
"11216060","11216900"," You want us to go to some upper targets?"
"11217640","11219180"," You want to go like Tesla bull time?"
"11224210","11227050"," Oh, let's look at 50 and 60 38, 50 and 61."
"11227350","11228310"," You guys want some craziness?"
"11228930","11233610"," Uh, 220."
"11233830","11234270"," Where's 222?"
"11240480","11241580"," We'll throw some up here. "
"11245880","11247580"," Get them all hot and sweaty up here."
"11248080","11248800"," There's one target."
"11251880","11254200"," I know you're some of your build bulls in here, so. "
"11272020","11273340"," There's another target."
"11276480","11278060"," That's a big one right there."
"11281720","11284300"," Get the bulls off fucking super hot. "
"11292140","11292920"," There's another one."
"11295920","11299380"," These are all fabric retracement, scholastic retracement."
"11304900","11305660"," Hold on here. "
"11305880","11307120"," Getting some walkiness going on."
"11313040","11315780"," This is the full retracement 100%."
"11320360","11321180"," Sold it down. "
"11321900","11323160"," Buyers sold it down."
"11323560","11324100"," Buyers a week."
"11324640","11325360"," Lost it right there. "
"11326140","11327060"," That's not the full retracement."
"11327220","11328180"," The full retracement's even higher."
"11329060","11330100"," Way to fuck up there, but. "
"11330960","11332140"," This is a critical thing."
"11332440","11332840"," This is where."
"11334040","11337240"," So just as let's say you want to trade this back up on Tesla. "
"11337240","11341140"," You want to see that this was major support right here, right?"
"11342820","11345600"," This is where the bulls were here, right?"
"11345720","11348780"," They pushed it up one last time and distribution came back down."
"11349360","11351120"," And bulls were expecting."
"11353720","11355700"," This to get bought right here. "
"11356160","11356480"," Okay."
"11358440","11363440"," Bulls were saying fuck you were defending this line right here and they got trapped in here."
"11364240","11366860"," So as you come back up here, right?"
"11366860","11369040"," You've got bulls that are trapped right now. "
"11369040","11370520"," They're like, please Jesus."
"11370940","11371280"," Please."
"11372380","11372780"," Whatever. "
"11373160","11373520"," I don't know."
"11374180","11375000"," Your own deity."
"11375580","11377220"," Please spaghetti monster God. "
"11378360","11381040"," Just get to right here and I swear I'll sell out of my position."
"11383380","11386020"," This is going to be a major resistance point right here."
"11387480","11391080"," And then you've got another group of sellers up here that are like, oh, please. "
"11391280","11391560"," You know what?"
"11391640","11392320"," I have a little bit more faith."
"11392420","11393200"," We're going to get a little bit higher."
"11394220","11397460"," Then you get another group of sellers up here and they're like, please. "
"11397820","11399760"," I'll just, all I want is 70% back."
"11399920","11401240"," I don't care about the other 30%."
"11402200","11403440"," I swear I'll just get out of my calls. "
"11404460","11406580"," And you get this last little tiny group up here."
"11407840","11411480"," And these are the guys up here that are like, oh, we're going to the moon, bro."
"11412940","11414580"," And they're fucking lying to you. "
"11415620","11417700"," They don't think for a minute they're going to the moon."
"11417880","11418380"," You know what they think?"
"11419220","11421100"," If I tell everybody we're going to the moon."
"11422360","11426660"," Where I got trapped here, I'm going to fucking dump a million shares of Tesla right there. "
"11429040","11432820"," I'm going to go on my Twitter handle with five million followers and I'm going to tell them that"
"11432820","11433560"," we're going to the moon."
"11434660","11440380"," And then the moment we get in here, I'm going to hammer the market with like fucking, I'm going to"
"11440380","11442920"," dump like a half a billion dollars for the stock because I got trapped."
"11444520","11446880"," And I hope we catch another dip lower. "
"11450120","11456960"," And when that happens, when that happens, what's going to happen is this."
"11459300","11463740"," We'll actually blast through this level and start moving up and they'll fucking buy another shitty"
"11463740","11466140"," position higher and we'll trade lower and they'll get trapped again."
"11468940","11473140"," That's pretty much what's going to happen to a whole group of people. "
"11477500","11479120"," Whoever bought this right here."
"11479760","11482980"," It's probably going to happen to them again on a higher time frame."
"11486060","11486900"," So horrible. "
"11491080","11492440"," So there you have it."
"11493900","11499460"," Likely to get to our three chances of going higher here become more difficult and more difficult."
"11499680","11500160"," You can get up there. "
"11500160","11506440"," But you're going to meet, you're going to meet these sellers, trap sellers that are going to give"
"11506440","11507900"," you some some firm resistance above."
"11509020","11510980"," You can take a snapshot of this if you want."
"11512640","11515720"," So you can see where all these are, our levels are. "
"11520140","11526750"," Yeah, that was valid right there."
"11528170","11533890"," If you're a bull, you do not want to see if you're a bull."
"11536550","11538510"," You do not want to see a roll. "
"11539590","11541070"," You want to know a bearish is."
"11542130","11546630"," You start coming back down here right and giving this part up right here."
"11547410","11549850"," This part right here, you start giving this up right here. "
"11550450","11551530"," It's going to get fucking nasty."
"11553290","11556150"," It's going to get, I'm going to get my price target down below of 136."
"11556330","11557210"," I promise you. "
"11559230","11564930"," I promise I'll get, I'll promise we buying Tesla stock at like $90 and 136 down here."
"11565470","11566290"," It'll be a bloodbath."
"11567010","11570550"," You might get a retest down there like, Oh, hit 136 and we're off and running again. "
"11571770","11573290"," I get 90 bucks for off and running again."
"11573450","11575370"," But I'll tell you what, start trading down that way, man."
"11576230","11577250"," Fucking look out. "
"11579270","11580390"," Look the fuck out."
"11582990","11585790"," You J.P.O. saved some asses yesterday."
"11586990","11588050"," He said it yesterday. "
"11588410","11592650"," If any of you guys will watch the whole broadcast, he said, I don't want to crash the stock market."
"11593790","11596170"," Zach words, almost to the quote."
"11597310","11601130"," This move right here, he saved bulls me. "
"11601250","11601710"," He saved me."
"11601850","11602450"," He saved all of us."
"11604310","11605950"," You should get back down. "
"11606150","11610170"," You have, you guys haven't been kneeling at the, at the altar of J.P.O. for the past year."
"11611890","11612690"," Start sucking."
"11613670","11614870"," Get on your hands and knees. "
"11616950","11618630"," Go to the, go to the garage."
"11619650","11623770"," Break out your old statue of J.P.O. Dust them off."
"11626630","11628190"," Retouch his face with some paint. "
"11628490","11629410"," Put a new suit on him."
"11630450","11631670"," Bring him into the living room."
"11632570","11635010"," Tell your boyfriend, say, sorry, bro, you got to go. "
"11636530","11638090"," Put J.P.O. in the center of the room."
"11638310","11639090"," Put the lights on him."
"11639990","11643650"," Turn the, turn the thermostat up because, because he's going to start making you some money. "
"11643650","11644570"," You can afford heat now."
"11645550","11648390"," Start making leaving donations of your best food at his feet."
"11650650","11654450"," Start sucking because J.P.O. saved your ass. "
"11657130","11658710"," He intervened yesterday."
"11658730","11660510"," You got a J.P.O. intervention yesterday."
"11663830","11667110"," If I was a bear right now, it would be so fucking pissed. "
"11672480","11679980"," J.P.O. came out yesterday and fucking went full fucking bull."
"11680840","11681040"," Sorry."
"11684180","11691040"," If you're a Tesla bull, a tech bull, if you're a bull in general, start sucking because J.P.O."
"11691240","11692220"," saved the market yesterday. "
"11697940","11703280"," Here I am thinking we're going to get out of the bell and the support of this market is going"
"11703660","11703860"," nowhere."
"11705100","11706400"," I don't care about your Dixie captain."
"11706860","11707680"," We're going up. "
"11711400","11712080"," That's right."
"11713940","11715360"," Tell your wife."
"11715360","11715940"," Tell your girl. "
"11716160","11716600"," Hide your wife."
"11716780","11717300"," Hide your kids."
"11717940","11718580"," Hide your girlfriend. "
"11719560","11720360"," Hide your boyfriend."
"11720640","11721260"," Hide your husband."
"11722620","11724160"," Your boyfriend's back in town. "
"11724360","11725320"," His name's Jerome Powell."
"11731980","11733040"," Fuck me, man."
"11733160","11734280"," That was crazy yesterday. "
"11735760","11736980"," That was absolutely insane."
"11737260","11740800"," Oh, you guys should go back as we were listening to it."
"11741660","11745160"," You guys should go back and watch the video because as we were listening to it, I was in steam"
"11745160","11745680"," and I go. "
"11746420","11751620"," Did he just say, did he just can't say pivot or a policy shift?"
"11751680","11756940"," He didn't say it, but I said, did he just say the magic words for policy shift?"
"11757520","11761380"," It was crazy to listen to that shit yesterday."
"11761480","11762480"," It was fucking crazy."
"11763540","11768980"," I was talking to Joe Harper yesterday or Joe at Donate yesterday and I said to him, I was like,"
"11769060","11771040"," do you want to relate it to what exactly it was like yesterday?"
"11771520","11775100"," It was like, it's like you had a girlfriend and you cheated on. "
"11775260","11776540"," You had the evidence or boyfriend."
"11776800","11777040"," You had a boyfriend."
"11777300","11777860"," You knew he cheated on. "
"11777900","11781100"," You knew eventually it was going to come out."
"11781720","11784660"," You knew there was going to be an opportunity in like a month or three months where he was going"
"11784660","11786500"," to, he was going to get caught."
"11787700","11789940"," And so you can find him and you're like, watch this motherfucker over here. "
"11789960","11791040"," He's going to fucking lie to me."
"11791940","11796400"," I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to have this opportunity in like a month, three"
"11796400","11797200"," months to catch his ass."
"11798720","11802320"," And instead your boyfriend is like, you can find him and your boyfriend just comes clean and says,"
"11802940","11805640"," the truth is, I did cheat on you. "
"11806820","11807760"," I'm a bad person."
"11807900","11809240"," I made a really bad heart mistake."
"11809680","11812460"," You should dump me and move on. "
"11813920","11815120"," And it is my fault."
"11815480","11816220"," It's not your fault."
"11816940","11817880"," I wanted to cheat on you. "
"11818040","11819460"," I should have just broken up with you in advance."
"11819460","11821640"," That was pretty much the moment yesterday."
"11822860","11829160"," Because he could have been the cheating boyfriend and just talked the market down for the next one"
"11829160","11829640"," to three months. "
"11830440","11832300"," He chose against that shit yesterday."
"11833400","11837400"," So he was honest, dishonest, but honest."
"11841260","11844980"," Totally dishonest, but completely honest at the same time in a bad way. "
"11846980","11848560"," Whatever kind of honesty there is."
"11848900","11852360"," And I was not expecting that yesterday at all to hear that from him."
"11852900","11853860"," It was pretty fucking shocked. "
"11857810","11858570"," He got me."
"11859650","11860510"," He gooseed me."
"11860690","11862170"," I was expecting him to lie still. "
"11863130","11865630"," I was like, he's going to fucking, he's going to drag this out."
"11867010","11869270"," Of course, the next question becomes, can't lie in the minutes."
"11869670","11871390"," And when does the market not believe in many more?"
"11871490","11872710"," The stock market, the equity market. "
"11873170","11875850"," Other markets don't believe in many more, but the equity market."
"11875850","11879810"," At some point would stop believing the bullshit scams lies."
"11886840","11887840"," Yeah, reach around assist. "
"11890280","11891840"," No, I don't think so."
"11892140","11892680"," That's not true."
"11892800","11895200"," I'd be very wary of those statements that you hear in Twitter. "
"11895920","11899680"," I'm going to tell you right now, like 70% of Twitter does not know what to listen for."
"11901840","11902980"," I can prove it to you."
"11904140","11905380"," I'll put it out for you. "
"11905380","11906780"," I'll put it on a cat captain's office."
"11906780","11910300"," I'll show you the data that disagrees with that statement."
"11911720","11914900"," In a dumb way, you can just look at how yesterday we went out. "
"11915080","11916040"," It wasn't short covering."
"11916060","11916740"," It was high volume."
"11917200","11917620"," That's different. "
"11918380","11920460"," It's a very simple way to look and see."
"11921160","11924440"," You don't need someone on Twitter or a news company saying it's just words."
"11925260","11926820"," There's already data out showing it's happening. "
"11928380","11933160"," And there are other markets that are already already know this and are already showing it."
"11935080","11935640"," Expressing it."
"11937320","11941120"," And you saw the volume that came into the market yesterday that was not short covering. "
"11942480","11944760"," He had a low volume pumping the clothes yesterday."
"11944760","11945620"," I would say yes."
"11946240","11950760"," They were just words, but he used key phrases of like about the three minute mark when he started"
"11950760","11951100"," talking. "
"11951100","11952300"," He started using key phrases."
"11955100","11956620"," And that was the gig was up."
"11957980","11959520"," Be wary of people on Twitter. "
"11959960","11961780"," Be wary of reading newspapers right now."
"11961780","11963540"," There are news magazines."
"11964100","11970240"," There are some real true market movers that know exactly what happened yesterday. "
"11972980","11974100"," Very smart people."
"11974440","11977280"," Not me, but very, very, very, very, very, very, very smart."
"11983660","11988020"," Arcade market technicians that know what happened yesterday. "
"11988020","11990680"," And those guys call their guys."
"11990840","11993820"," Those guys call their guys and they are the first ones."
"11993820","11995060"," And that's what they did yesterday. "
"11997100","11998660"," They call that guy in the big ass shot."
"11998800","11999300"," The mother of the ocean."
"11999300","12001080"," They tell him you need to buy right now. "
"12002960","12004200"," And that's what happened yesterday."
"12005120","12006180"," I warned you of that."
"12006340","12006860"," That is true. "
"12007440","12010200"," Now they'll pull their money out as we come into certain moments, right?"
"12010300","12015360"," We're going to look for and they will look for indications as we go down the road."
"12015360","12023060"," If the economy is going to go in the way that is expected to go and that the Fed is"
"12023060","12026880"," going to move in the way that it's being expected, even though they haven't admitted to it."
"12027680","12031040"," So there'll be mile markers and checkpoints for all this money that came into the market. "
"12031220","12031800"," But I assure you."
"12033000","12033820"," I assure you."
"12035280","12036700"," That was not what happened yesterday. "
"12037520","12039480"," Do not get caught in the wrong side of that."
"12039960","12042500"," If you do, right, you will give a million dollars back to the market."
"12042500","12043180"," I promise you. "
"12043900","12045120"," I fucking promise."
"12047360","12049540"," I don't give a fuck what anyone in Twitter is saying."
"12049840","12052140"," I don't give a fine fuck what anyone's saying in the news. "
"12052480","12053460"," I don't give a fine fuck."
"12054800","12060620"," There's like 10 guys that publicly talk about this stuff in detail."
"12060900","12062720"," You can't really understand how these guys are talking. "
"12063140","12064360"," I'm telling you, these guys are talking."
"12064740","12066800"," They fucking know what's up."
"12068720","12070120"," There's like 10 guys I know. "
"12070120","12072920"," Like maybe 10 and I barely understand half of what they're saying."
"12073440","12075720"," Maybe I might understand 10% of what they're saying."
"12078080","12079880"," I'm telling you, man, that was a turn yesterday. "
"12080880","12082760"," He could have waited until all the way up to March."
"12083640","12085220"," He fucking came clean yesterday."
"12085620","12086820"," He fucking scammed out yesterday. "
"12086820","12087500"," I'm so shocked."
"12088620","12089620"," He fucking did it."
"12089660","12090820"," I was so shocked they did it yesterday. "
"12091400","12091860"," Completely unexpected."
"12096030","12098230"," I thought they were going to drag it out into spring."
"12108800","12109860"," That's a good question, Brian. "
"12111380","12117660"," I was talking to Joe on the phone last night and I was talking about if we are at a"
"12117660","12117900"," bottom."
"12118140","12120840"," I don't know that we are, but if we are, you're going to look for certain signs."
"12122160","12123860"," I was like, you'll see signs in the market. "
"12125480","12126380"," That were in a bottom."
"12129070","12131290"," You're going to be looking for signs in the market that were at a bottom."
"12133270","12134450"," And we were talking about. "
"12135850","12139450"," I used to give people lists of stock picks to trade."
"12140390","12141930"," I'd say, hey, if you look at the stock, right?"
"12142550","12143490"," You just buy the bottom."
"12143650","12146190"," It's on a trend for like a three years now. "
"12146330","12148370"," Just buy the bottom, buy the bottom, buy the bottom, buy the bottom, buy the bottom."
"12149170","12150310"," It's all spec growth stuff."
"12151530","12154650"," You can find, I've got a list of these still. "
"12154810","12155230"," I haven't put them out."
"12155870","12158570"," I'm trying to build a team of people so I can be like, hey, can you put these stock picks"
"12158570","12162250"," out every week for me or help me with that."
"12162250","12163930"," Pretty guys are ever interested in that stuff. "
"12163990","12164570"," Let me know too."
"12166070","12168230"," So you can have a list of stocks to look at every week."
"12168410","12170490"," I want Winky to help me with it because he's a badass. "
"12170990","12171950"," Any guys know Winky?"
"12172690","12174410"," He is a stock technician."
"12175070","12176370"," Guys, a fucking monster."
"12177650","12180050"," He'll talk himself down, but he's fucking gangster. "
"12182490","12184790"," Anyways, we all have our own picks and stocks, right?"
"12184910","12186810"," But there's some guys that are really good at stock picking."
"12187330","12191590"," Anyways, I used to put out these lists and say, you know, this one right here is, you're not knife "
"12191590","12191830","-catching."
"12192030","12192730"," It's just in trend. "
"12193570","12194290"," Banks are buying it."
"12194730","12196150"," They're going to buy it for the next three years."
"12197430","12200430"," And so last night we were talking about someone's asking about PayPal. "
"12202670","12206850"," And I said to Joe, I said, you know, you're more than likely you're going to see speculative growth"
"12206850","12207290"," stocks."
"12207950","12209610"," That includes tech, mostly tech."
"12210610","12213530"," You should see speculative growth, catch a rip. "
"12213530","12216490"," And you should see tech, catch a rip."
"12217290","12220370"," You should see money leave the Dow and enter tech."
"12222710","12229050"," You'll see people on the internet tell you, you're going to see like famous people, hedge fund"
"12229050","12229390"," guys. "
"12231050","12233090"," Say, oh no, stay in the Dow."
"12235410","12236810"," It's always going up."
"12236950","12237930"," It's always safe haven. "
"12238330","12239130"," Stay in small caps."
"12239410","12240530"," You'll hear this from people."
"12241650","12247850"," And the reality is that all the money is going to use should shift into more riskier equities. "
"12248330","12255170"," Now, within that statement, you're going to want to say, well, should I jump back in PayPal?"
"12257050","12258230"," That's a good example."
"12258990","12260370"," Or I should jump in Peton."
"12261290","12263710"," In a matter of fact, yesterday, there was an initial rip in Peton. "
"12264470","12267330"," It went up to like 8% or something yesterday, 7%."
"12267330","12271850"," And so you don't want to jump in the initial rip."
"12272370","12273850"," Some companies didn't participate. "
"12274410","12275390"," Some companies did."
"12276090","12280990"," More than likely, there's some companies that are known that will not survive."
"12282230","12285350"," If we do, if the market does go up, they won't participate. "
"12288050","12289590"," Facebook might be another one."
"12291570","12294170"," I would wait to see what shakes out."
"12294690","12295650"," What's a fake rip?"
"12295650","12298850"," I think there's some that ripped yesterday that might not continue to participate. "
"12299810","12300930"," Joe was like, well, how will you know?"
"12301810","12303550"," And I said, I know exactly how I know."
"12304130","12309210"," You're going to see new furrows come out and they're going to pick them for you."
"12311070","12313050"," They're going to come out and they're going to say, I got this new company. "
"12314350","12315330"," They did their startup."
"12315630","12316950"," They've been in business for like two years."
"12317850","12320370"," And they're going to promise you something stupid that they're going to do. "
"12322370","12327030"," Instead of exercise bikes, they're making actual bikes like the piton, but it's outside you ride"
"12327030","12327250"," them outside."
"12328090","12329950"," And it's got some cool fucking feature on it."
"12330610","12331850"," And they're going to talk about them and talk about them. "
"12331950","12336230"," And you're going to see other guys talk about them and talk about them on YouTube and shit and then"
"12336230","12340050"," pump and dump circles to start seeing bots on Twitter."
"12341150","12343330"," That's the spec growth you probably want to get into."
"12344830","12350030"," If this happens, if there is a market direction change, and you're looking to get into like spec"
"12350030","12353130"," growth or tech stocks, let it shake out for a little bit. "
"12353990","12354870"," Give it some time."
"12355230","12356690"," You don't need the bottom, be the bottom buyer."
"12358050","12360630"," I even think some of the ones that got pumped yesterday will not participate. "
"12361490","12362310"," There's a reason for that too."
"12364590","12365790"," Like, pitons are good example."
"12367190","12368610"," Who wants to hear about piton anymore?"
"12369370","12370950"," Nobody wants to fucking hear about piton. "
"12371070","12373290"," If you go back in like 0708, you go back in 2000."
"12374750","12384160"," If any of you have experienced trading penny stocks like $1 to $20 stocks that are not pharma, the"
"12384160","12392380"," stock market is littered with companies that still a decade later only costs $1 to $5."
"12393240","12401100"," If you look at their history way back in like 0708, they're fucking trading at $200, $300, $150. "
"12403220","12406780"," You'll see that they have a, you'll see that you can actually search back in their history."
"12407600","12411960"," And they were like featured in the New York Times, the next big company."
"12414060","12418840"," And what really happens is they're, they're scam, they're shell companies. "
"12419880","12424000"," They've got like 20 employees, they never come back, they made a bunch of money."
"12425900","12429260"," There's now a small company, small firm, they've got like 20 employees, they're making money,"
"12429260","12429760"," they're all happy."
"12429760","12431060"," They're all fat, they had their moment. "
"12431640","12433280"," And no one wants to hear about that company anymore."
"12433320","12434380"," They want to hear about the next company."
"12435500","12437020"," You can look at any industry like that. "
"12439880","12443620"," Any small, small sector of the stock market."
"12444540","12446380"," You want like security cameras, right?"
"12446800","12450880"," Security cameras, you look at cell phones, you look at, no, maybe not cell phones, probably not,"
"12450960","12451880"," but in the sub sectors."
"12452660","12454160"," All those companies do like smaller things. "
"12456020","12456920"," They come and they go."
"12457920","12460720"," And you'll find the next pumper out there pumping the next new thing."
"12460960","12462140"," Because it's shining, it's new. "
"12463380","12466280"," So like yesterday, Peton was like, oh yeah, we'll fucking pump it."
"12466640","12469300"," If I guarantee you, there's like another bike company out there just waiting."
"12470320","12471580"," Like the pump is always out there. "
"12472080","12473740"," And they're just going to, you're going to be stuck in Peton."
"12474800","12477300"," And they're going to see like 20 guys on fucking YouTube going."
"12478180","12480940"," You know, fuck Peton, I got this kick ass company, it's going to go somewhere. "
"12484710","12485250"," I promise."
"12486150","12489450"," If the market is, if the market is shifting, you will see it."
"12489670","12490310"," Mark my words. "
"12494880","12496460"," Oh yeah, Winky's talking about this."
"12499700","12500420"," Boom, boom."
"12501300","12502860"," The market is littered with dead bodies. "
"12503140","12507040"," Yeah, anyone here that's traded $1 to $5."
"12507320","12508100"," Well, it's not $1."
"12508280","12509180"," I think it's three is the minimum. "
"12509700","12511640"," They like, they slip in and out of probation."
"12512860","12516500"," But anyone that's traded like penny stocks, like $1 of $20 stocks knows."
"12517420","12521460"," If you start doing due diligence on a ton of these companies, you're like, wow, this company looks"
"12521460","12521660"," great. "
"12523460","12525140"," And you're like, oh, 20 year old company."
"12526120","12529240"," So you're like, well, I'm going to read some of the news stories when they, when they first"
"12529240","12530260"," launched 20 years ago."
"12530400","12532460"," And you're like, holy shit, these traded at 70, $80. "
"12533140","12534620"," Holy shit, these traded at 150."
"12534880","12535180"," What happened?"
"12538810","12540670"," It's like a, it's like a new girl, right?"
"12540790","12541270"," A new boyfriend."
"12542410","12543210"," How with the old thing with the new?"
"12543210","12550940"," Oh, I remember we talked about this yesterday. "
"12551040","12551540"," Chet and right."
"12551680","12557640"," Remember I was telling yesterday that I was in, I was up late the other night and I said, hey,"
"12557720","12560120"," you made a post about China, China lockdowns."
"12560240","12563260"," So they don't want the, the, the currency manipulation. "
"12564540","12568040"," They're going to slowly leak that they're, that they're easing lockdowns."
"12568760","12572060"," And you're going to see, you guys got news stories lined up for market to go up."
"12572240","12573740"," You got China. "
"12575040","12575780"," You have peace."
"12575780","12580280"," Peace talks with, with, with Taiwan and China and the US."
"12581780","12586920"," The longer that that war with, with Russia and Ukraine. "
"12589080","12591260"," Goes on, like the longer it goes on, right?"
"12591660","12592680"," If you have like a time band."
"12593260","12596940"," If you have like a, if you have like a time band, right?"
"12598440","12599440"," If you're a bear."
"12600600","12603340"," This is, this is, this is the bell curve, right?"
"12604200","12609960"," Oh man, we're in war, or we got a war in, in Europe with, with Ukraine as tight passes. "
"12611100","12611860"," Oh baby."
"12612640","12615340"," There is a chance of nuclear war with China, right?"
"12615580","12616340"," Or with, with Russia."
"12616740","12617660"," Oh, it's nasty, right?"
"12618120","12619980"," But there comes a point where like a year has passed. "
"12621480","12627200"," Where the likelihood of some kind of peace resolution comes to pass."
"12627920","12629560"," So, you know, this works for a bear."
"12631240","12632440"," This all works in here. "
"12633380","12636700"," But there's this like diminishing returns in time."
"12637880","12638980"," China is the same way."
"12642040","12646980"," So, so we have some bulls have some fucking bulls. "
"12647500","12651020"," If it doesn't happen now, but it between now and springtime."
"12651780","12653240"," Next three or four months, man."
"12653460","12655380"," And the fed probably knows that too, right?"
"12655960","12657260"," You got a front run all that bullshit. "
"12657260","12660280"," Can't let fucking, can't let that all that shit happen."
"12660480","12661880"," And people being off sides, right?"
"12665300","12668260"," They got a front run that news and have people buy the tops and that shit."
"12671140","12672760"," These banks are savages. "
"12674700","12675820"," Banks are savages."
"12676000","12676960"," They'll run all this shit up."
"12677120","12679520"," They're going to run all this fucking fed shift in policy change. "
"12680080","12682220"," Run up the fucking COVID reopenings."
"12682380","12687560"," Run up the fucking peace talks with Taiwan and fucking China."
"12687560","12691140"," They're going to run up fucking the Ukraine Russia war on you. "
"12692200","12693540"," All that shit comes out."
"12694160","12695940"," And the fucking market will be at all time highs."
"12696160","12699940"," And you'll be like, Jimmy the mechanic going, well, you know what?"
"12700400","12701240"," Economy's feeling pretty good. "
"12701420","12702440"," Inflation's come down a little bit."
"12702520","12703020"," Some price stability."
"12703900","12705400"," I'm going to be able to get parts again for my shop. "
"12706680","12707280"," Look at that."
"12707380","12708540"," Apple stock's that fucking $200."
"12709780","12710880"," Fucking war has ended. "
"12711400","12711840"," Wife's happy."
"12712000","12712860"," I haven't lost my house yet."
"12713560","12715200"," I got some value coming back in my house. "
"12715400","12716640"," Maybe I should buy the Apple stock now."
"12722350","12724290"," And that's not when you should have bought the Apple stock."
"12742390","12743390"," Does that make sense?"
"12743750","12744750"," So they're just front run in this shit. "
"12745750","12747150"," A bunch of fucking front runners."
"12748570","12751030"," That's my guess is that this is a big front run operation."
"12753710","12759710"," scumbag is gonna front run it but time it happens fucking stock market will be back fucking"

"13112090","13118790"," maybe I got out too early you don't really want nothing to do with that shit go buy a Lambo"
"13118790","13128560"," or something and go hang out fuck around so that I was looking at people talking"
"13128560","13135520"," about you know like EPS earnings projections are coming in low for next year they're not accounting"
"13135520","13143980"," for two things they're not accounting for for structural changes in our economy and my assumption"
"13143980","13150220"," would be I think we do get a low on NQ1 for sure I think that the analysts are gonna"
"13150220","13156100"," be get are gonna get fucked next year and it doesn't matter if it happens or doesn't they're gonna"
"13156100","13161220"," front run it anyways that it doesn't really matter they're gonna front run it you know they are we"
"13161220","13170220"," typically get a low in January we typically get a low in March as well so you probably see it"
"13170220","13181830"," that's a seasonal thing that happens in"
"13181830","13186730"," the analyst they weren't wrong this quarter but they typically are wrong and if they keep reducing"
"13186730","13191070"," they keep lowering their their expectations for next year they're gonna get caught with their pants"
"13191070","13197810"," that pants is dumb don't tell you what like layoffs if I have a company right and I have a"
"13197810","13204530"," hundred thousand employees hundred thousand boys right and I lay off 10,000 employees I'm gonna be"
"13204530","13210370"," profitable that means I'm cutting everywhere cutting the fat please looking at programs we have"
"13210370","13217490"," going on which ones pay which ones don't if I lay off 90,000 employees that's bad right we haven't"
"13217490","13225470"," had that yet so I'd be very wary of analysts expectations for next year"
"13225470","13233850"," and I would I welcome lower expectations into those ER seasons and if I were you I'd be tracking"
"13233850","13239650"," companies that don't not all of them are gonna work but a lot of companies I talked about banks on"
"13239650","13244810"," this and banks went to the fucking moon they were they ended up being nice that you should watch"
"13244810","13250090"," banks if they're straight down in this ER season the last season the one before it was like I think"
"13250090","13256270"," they're gonna trade them down and their EPS expectations were very low like you start seeing"
"13256270","13262810"," companies have low earnings season expectations and analysts are expecting less and if they don't"
"13262810","13271020"," get traded up into those earnings seasons those are the ones that will fucking moon and that's that"

"13417170","13417790"," I don't like that trade."
"13423520","13424800"," Let me spread these out."
"13426300","13428480"," A percent chance of profit by the second. "
"13434270","13435390"," Hang tight here for a minute."
"13436910","13439730"," Do all you guys know how to manage butterflies?"

"13470410","13475030"," 4.3. I feel like the idea of a lot of a wide."
"13476450","13477790"," Butterflies are paying right now."
"13478650","13482890"," So like a butterfly with like a max risk of tomorrow, expiry. "
"13483350","13488390"," $146 for a gain of $3.54. It has a 59% chance of probability."
"13489550","13495390"," The legs are at 4.12, 4.07, 4.07, and 4.02. But I'd widen them out a little"
"13495390","13496110"," bit for less profit."
"13503750","13505090"," Let's see R3 up here. "
"13505390","13508570"," So like R3, R1, R2."
"13508970","13509850"," R3 is 425."
"13510610","13510830"," Jesus. "
"13513900","13514180"," So 425."
"13516260","13518240"," And then what's that swan down here?"
"13519880","13520540"," What's that 3?"
"13521140","13523100"," 3.83. Oof."
"13529090","13530070"," Does that even pay?"
"13531090","13532010"," How much does it pay?"
"13541500","13542560"," A lot of second here. "
"13553560","13554360"," What did I say?"
"13554460","13584220"," 3.83. Like"
"13584220","13584920"," a wide butterfly."
"13587340","13591860"," Like 3.83 and 4.12. So I say 4.12 and 4.20. 5."
"13592680","13596220"," Like a giant butterfly in the market for tomorrow and the next day would be the way to go."
"13648960","13650440"," So I'm running some models here. "
"13658480","13665920"," Look at this here."
"13670230","13671370"," Getting some support here."
"13671510","13671810"," You see that?"
"13671970","13672490"," Look at that move. "
"13682260","13686620"," Yeah, there's a, uh, we're coming in some support and not a lot of sellers above here."
"13688140","13688700"," There's some."
"13688800","13690140"," This is the only resistance we have. "
"13691280","13693740"," So this resistance come down slightly, but it's weakened."
"13695080","13696020"," Now right here."
"13697620","13699560"," But it's not as heavy as it was earlier. "
"13701140","13704130"," I could get a squeeze here."
"13708980","13710000"," There's nothing above."
"13710780","13711940"," There's some price targets above. "
"13713760","13717200"," 4.12. 4.15. These right here."
"13718180","13718900"," These are your targets."
"13734910","13736690"," You guys don't know what spreads are. "
"13736970","13741010"," So, uh, spreads are really cool or really easy to execute in Robinhood, but they suck it."
"13741010","13748290"," Uh, I think our Tasty is a pretty cool setup for trading and learning how to trade spreads."
"13748750","13749870"," I think our swim does as well. "
"13751530","13758150"," If you want a basic way to figure out spreads, um, hold on."
"13760390","13763630"," Like you want to like taste of what spreads."
"13764130","13764530"," Let me see. "
"13764750","13774410"," I used to trade on this company, but I"
"13774410","13774790"," don't."
"13776170","13783900"," Let's see if this is cool."
"13783960","13784400"," We could do this. "
"13793780","13800420"," Um, so I used to use, I used to use this company."
"13800600","13802100"," This, so I still have a brokerage here."
"13802200","13802460"," Okay. "
"13802460","13803800"," So you guys want to see some cool?"
"13804000","13805740"," You guys want to stay for the move here and see if we sell."
"13806520","13807780"," If you have some time, we'll look at this."
"13808640","13813080"," If you're a new trader or if you don't trade options or not options, but spreads. "
"13815200","13816000"," I got some cool for you."
"13818800","13820200"," Yeah, we'll see what happens here."
"13821520","13823780"," If we have, if we break out to the upside, we'll look. "
"13827780","13836120"," Uh, see if you can see if there's any kind of like any kind of a pattern emerging here."
"13836340","13836880"," I don't see one."
"13837360","13837880"," Be honest with you. "
"13839200","13841340"," Not, I don't, my, my hopes aren't up here."
"13841400","13842400"," I'll be honest with you."
"13844300","13846740"," I have zero faith in this being the big move. "
"13846740","13848520"," It might be, you guys can be right, man."
"13848620","13849660"," I am wrong sometimes."
"13852500","13859810"," Uh, I mean, this is it. "
"13861250","13862690"," Contextually, this is bullish."
"13866270","13867130"," Trade below, right?"
"13867390","13867730"," One, two."
"13868630","13870790"," I'd be looking for something like that though. "
"13871930","13873870"," That's the trade that I would like to take right there."
"13874130","13875570"," But I know some of you guys are like, nope."
"13876670","13878650"," I know some of you guys are like, they're the one, the two. "
"13879750","13880290"," Building some momentum."
"13880290","13882790"," And then we're going to, we're just going to rocket ship."
"13882950","13884010"," I can see what you're saying here. "
"13889180","13890940"," I won't take that trade with you."
"13891240","13891680"," You can."
"13893560","13898020"," If you wanted some confirmation on this trade, you would see this. "
"13898880","13900760"," This, you'd trade it to here."
"13901580","13904020"," Wait for the break above and then look for the squeeze."
"13904620","13906420"," So you take profit right where we are right now. "
"13907260","13908440"," You take this profit here."
"13910740","13912760"," Reenter the trade somewhere in here above."
"13915510","13916710"," So you take your money in here. "
"13916790","13918510"," You wait for this breakthrough and breakout."
"13918570","13920050"," And then you take the leg of higher."
"13921650","13923290"," I might end to that with if you break above. "
"13925210","13927150"," So, we'll look at it."
"13927730","13928870"," We'll get really close on it."
"13929130","13929930"," See if it starts happening. "
"13934550","13935350"," It's a good buy down here."
"13935950","13936890"," Another good buy down here."
"13937870","13938610"," V-wops coming up. "
"13938810","13939170"," This is nice."
"13939410","13939950"," This is all positive."
"13941190","13942110"," Moving averages in the one minute. "
"13943070","13944190"," That's the kind of five minute real quick."
"13945070","13948070"," Yeah, I mean, we're trading off."
"13948310","13949790"," This is a five minute chart, right?"
"13951930","13954450"," We're trading off the 100 and the 120 right now. "
"13954510","13955470"," We're getting a reaction on it."
"13955530","13956210"," We traded below it."
"13956910","13957650"," Cut support. "
"13958090","13959250"," This is actually pretty bullish."
"13959470","13960830"," If you look, oh, you guys can't see this."
"13964630","13970550"," You know, we're trading off the confluence of the the 120, the 200. "
"13972570","13974510"," The 100 is this pretty bullish, right?"
"13974750","13975150"," Trade it below."
"13975830","13978750"," Found support right at the 200 down here in the five minute chart."
"13979810","13981330"," It's looking like it wants to go higher. "
"13982070","13983470"," I got to give it to the bulls in this one."
"13987000","13988060"," They might get the move."
"13995800","13997260"," We'll keep the book back up. "
"13997380","13998460"," You guys are along right now."
"14009850","14016110"," If it does begin to fail, there's some places for you to look to capture it."
"14016390","14017770"," Be like right here, somewhere in here. "
"14018290","14019170"," View apps right here."
"14025060","14026820"," Maybe you get that breakout right there."
"14030060","14030740"," It's bullish. "
"14041120","14042540"," Adam's coming to spread the bullishness."
"14044260","14045020"," Kevin Verticals."
"14047300","14047740"," Yep. "
"14053830","14054310"," We'll go."
"14054430","14055030"," We'll look real quick."
"14055150","14056270"," I've got so I've got to open. "
"14056530","14057930"," I've got a website open called."
"14058470","14060310"," I have no affiliation with these people."
"14060310","14064850"," So I'm not not trying to push these people in any way. "
"14065010","14066710"," I don't I think they have shitty fills too."
"14067330","14070430"," I think I tried these guys out and they had really shitty fills."
"14070930","14074510"," Couldn't get fills when you when you should be able to get fills. "
"14076210","14080790"," This is called options.ai. We can look up spy."
"14081810","14086770"," It's a neat way to neat way to set up a trade."
"14087090","14087830"," You don't have to execute them here. "
"14087910","14089490"," If you've got like a Robin Hood account or something."
"14091690","14092290"," You can."
"14095110","14095650"," This is there. "
"14095810","14096450"," Let me go to the homepage."
"14102400","14103960"," It was a search page."
"14105220","14106100"," Search for companies. "
"14108960","14109600"," A scanner."
"14115310","14115630"," Positions."
"14118690","14119670"," Can you guys see all this?"
"14119850","14121370"," Let me see if they can bring this down so you can see it. "
"14123330","14129960"," I don't know if I'm doing this right or not."
"14130280","14130660"," Hold on a second."
"14130960","14131380"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"14133400","14134160"," Hold on a minute."
"14136930","14137590"," What was that?"
"14137750","14138050"," Shit."
"14138250","14139270"," What the fuck is going on?"
"14140870","14141690"," I want to see it. "
"14142290","14142710"," Okay."
"14144570","14146490"," Is that where you want to see it right there?"
"14151360","14152040"," Right there."
"14152940","14155900"," I'm going to mute or hold on here. "
"14156980","14157420"," Okay."
"14161180","14164120"," So this is options.ai. I don't use these guys."
"14164680","14165960"," I don't recommend using them. "
"14165960","14169680"," They have horrible fucking fills and on trades."
"14170620","14174100"," It's really cool to have an account with these guys because you can do a quick and dirty."
"14176000","14179000"," You can do a quick and dirty search on a company. "
"14179380","14181360"," So you can look at spy, especially if you're just new on spreads."
"14182400","14183800"," We'll just use spy as an example."
"14185600","14186100"," Let me go. "
"14186260","14188260"," Let me bring this to a different screen so you can see the entire screen."
"14188440","14188940"," Hold on a second here."
"14190680","14191680"," Let me just a second here. "
"14195490","14196370"," Let me just a second here."
"14196570","14197090"," I think I got a."
"14199690","14200050"," With."
"14201310","14201850"," All right. "
"14202050","14202550"," This is better."
"14210930","14211290"," Okay."
"14211330","14213370"," So you can now see me. "
"14216610","14217850"," So can you see the."
"14218770","14219630"," Yeah, you can see it."
"14219750","14219850"," Okay. "
"14219910","14221670"," So right here you type in spy right?"
"14221790","14222730"," We already did that type in spy."
"14223930","14224570"," Pick the spy."
"14225030","14225490"," We're already on it. "
"14226890","14228470"," We'll scroll through so you can see all this."
"14230310","14234970"," But you have the bulls expect for 21 for 21 50."
"14235170","14235850"," So there's a time frame. "
"14235970","14236330"," You get a week."
"14237490","14238590"," What the bulls expect."
"14240690","14242570"," So right up in here and right over here, right?"
"14242750","14245890"," You got what the bulls will expect and what the bears expect on a different time frame. "
"14246010","14246470"," This is a week."
"14247370","14248110"," This is a month."
"14248970","14249910"," This is three months. "
"14250730","14251530"," And this is a year."
"14252290","14252530"," Okay."
"14252530","14252590"," Okay. "
"14256210","14258530"," So the bears are expecting us to come down here."
"14258770","14261270"," The bulls are expecting us to come up here and retest, right?"
"14266230","14268070"," So let's say we're at a top of the market right now."
"14268210","14270110"," So we're at we think we're at the top and we're going to go down. "
"14270390","14271910"," So let's take a look at a three month spread."
"14272330","14273290"," We'll get three months spread."
"14274930","14276290"," And we'll click trade spy. "
"14277350","14280130"," And it's going to ask you are you bullish bearish neutral."
"14281450","14281830"," Okay."
"14281830","14283050"," This is really simple stuff. "
"14283210","14285010"," This is like video game arcade stuff."
"14287050","14288790"," So it's going to say to you are you bullish?"
"14289110","14290530"," Are you neutral or are you bearish?"
"14294470","14296930"," And let's say you're bearish, right?"
"14297330","14301390"," You just you think and even if we come up here, then we're going to come back and at least"
"14301390","14302790"," retest this over here, right?"
"14305270","14306730"," And you're going to give yourself."
"14306730","14311510"," Uh, strikes are are expiraries that are available. "
"14313030","14318910"," So you pick March 17th, let's say, or you pick March 31st, let's say, then you're bearish."
"14320310","14321830"," You could be neutral too."
"14322790","14326930"," We can we can go through neutral and bullish and what you think is going to happen. "
"14327530","14334510"," Let's say you're like, let's say you're like, um, let's say like, I think that even if we go up"
"14334510","14338870"," cap, we're going to at least try to try to retest these lows down here at some point."
"14339850","14341170"," And I want to put some time on it."
"14341330","14345430"," So if the bulls are in charge and they fucking bull stock, I hate them. "
"14346430","14349230"," We're likely going to at least retest this level right here."
"14350670","14354810"," 406 and you're like, I don't know how to trade spreads or how they work."
"14355570","14358170"," But I, but I can understand this simple chart here, right?"
"14358970","14364900"," It's a simple, simple diagram and you're bearish down here. "
"14364900","14366320"," So you're going to generate trades."
"14369700","14371860"," Now, this is for an entry level spread trader."
"14373500","14375140"," I guess they have puts now. "
"14375380","14379840"," So they actually offer you, I don't don't, I think when this website started, they didn't offer"
"14379840","14380640"," just puts."
"14381560","14385860"," So, but they do have three options for basic spreads, entry level spreads."
"14386800","14389540"," debit put spread, credit call spread, credit call spread. "
"14390340","14398880"," They list for you your risk, your max gains and your probability of profit, right?"
"14403700","14404900"," So let's, let's just start."
"14405120","14409180"," You can, you can, you can go back and forth like you hit the back button, the forward button and"
"14409180","14413500"," you can check each one of these strategies out and see which one's going to work for you."
"14413620","14414520"," This one's pretty juicy, right?"
"14415100","14418800"," We risk 900 bucks for a max gain of two grand, it's almost 2000% profit. "
"14420120","14422020"," I bet some of you don't win 39% of the time."
"14423380","14429520"," So we'll do, we'll do this one and it brings up this, this neat little graph right here."
"14429700","14431680"," It's, this is like a fucking video game. "
"14432480","14438220"," You can look at, you can look at just this chart right here and scroll your mouse around."
"14438340","14441260"," It'll tell you your chances of max gains, right?"
"14441640","14445540"," Losses and time down here shows March 31st."
"14446040","14450740"," If I take this trade now and we trade the market up, I'm at max losses, right?"
"14451140","14456840"," Now if we come back down and at any point to come down here, I'm going to start gaining money. "
"14457060","14462340"," On the right hand side of the screen, you can see it says $55, 450, 600, 800."
"14463280","14468740"," And at some point, this, this bottom line, I will break and stop gaining, right?"
"14468900","14470160"," You see this, see this line right here?"
"14470760","14471600"," I'll be at max gains."
"14472420","14477900"," So in that timeline, if we blast through here in the next month, I'd be at max gains. "
"14478540","14483180"," If it takes until the end of the trade for me to blast through, I'm going to get max gains."
"14483840","14487120"," Now there's rules that I use, like I take profit at 50%."
"14487780","14492360"," There's this whole time thing where we normally don't get that profit if you, if you entered the"
"14492360","14492880"," wrong time. "
"14493400","14497700"," Sometimes you'll be like, fuck, I entered it wrong and it's going up and they won't actually print"
"14497700","14503860"," that for the full, full 100% until, until right at that expiry, believe it or not."
"14504000","14506020"," Or the expiry afterwards, if you don't time them right."
"14507700","14513940"," So, but this is an easy way to look to see how a debit spread, debit, debit put spread works. "
"14515600","14522880"," Now, the neat part about this program is you can click the edit button up here and it's teaching"
"14522880","14526700"," you what a debit put spread is."
"14527240","14533580"," You can see in the left here, it says buy a 405 foot, sell a 374 foot."
"14533580","14538200"," And you can change these numbers to see what your profit loss is going to be. "
"14538600","14541020"," So right now we're at, right now we're at what?"
"14541260","14542500"," We're at 405, right?"
"14543980","14545440"," And you say to yourself, you know what?"
"14545540","14546680"," I think we're going to come back to 405."
"14547180","14550520"," So let's say we'll give the bulls a shot at closing the gap above at 421."
"14551660","14556120"," And I want to raise my retest at least. "
"14556340","14561640"," If you're like bearish, but not fully bearish, you'd be like, let's just say we come back at least"
"14561640","14563500"," and test the top of that key."
"14565540","14568740"," We could actually look and see how far down it's probably farther down."
"14568840","14574680"," It's probably like, if we come back and test the negative downward channel for the year, probably"
"14574680","14575980"," lower it like $3.90 or so. "
"14576120","14577080"," But you can just do pick 405."
"14578280","14579220"," Where we are right now?"
"14580520","14582000"," And you're putting it until March on it."
"14582200","14585020"," So, $4.21, $4.05 put March 31st, right?"
"14585720","14590320"," You're risking $734 for a max gain of $866. "
"14591040","14595380"," You now have a 54% chance of profit down here, right?"
"14595640","14597000"," This is all like video game shit."
"14597300","14597460"," Simple."
"14598180","14601780"," If you can't figure this shit out, you shouldn't be in the market. "
"14602260","14602780"," Real simple."
"14603640","14608180"," And you know, neat is like think or swim and tasty trades makes this shit hard."
"14608780","14612400"," If you're going to be really fast in the ball, you can usually run through the calculations on this"
"14612400","14614880"," program and then you execute them wherever you trade. "
"14615420","14616500"," You don't have to execute them here."
"14616600","14618420"," You just use it to run a quick analysis."
"14621440","14622580"," So boom, there we are. "
"14622780","14623780"," Now we come out of that chart, right?"
"14624460","14628640"," And we're looking and we're saying, okay, okay, so the fucking bulls come up here and they fuck"
"14628640","14629840"," around up here for a little while."
"14630440","14631880"," But I fucking know where they're coming back down."
"14632700","14638540"," All I needed to do by March 15 or March was March 17th, March 31st. "
"14641060","14642020"," Look at that right there."
"14643260","14652080"," Between now and March 31st, all I have to do is get below 405 "
"14652080","14658440",".62. Anything down in here, right?"
"14658600","14660360"," Well, they'll start gaining some profit."
"14660500","14660920"," Does that make sense?"
"14661440","14666760"," And as the time passes, I have more of an opportunity for it to come in and max gain. "
"14666920","14667420"," Does that make sense?"
"14672020","14674100"," I just need, you can be as bullish as you want."
"14674200","14674840"," It can be like, you know what?"
"14675020","14675300"," Fuck you."
"14675840","14679220"," I'm going to fucking, and it gets really juicy here too. "
"14679460","14683060"," If you're like, if you're like hardcore, I'm a bear."
"14684380","14685160"," I guarantee."
"14686920","14688060"," When can we go back here?"
"14689460","14696340"," I guarantee that a guaranteed cap are going down at least try 351 more time by March. "
"14699100","14701100"," Okay, so let's edit it."
"14701740","14702660"," And let's do 350."
"14707720","14708540"," Let's do 350. "
"14709220","14709900"," Save that strike."
"14711480","14712960"," Let's say you're like dead set on it."
"14713100","14714420"," Some point cap in the next. "
"14715240","14716260"," Some point cap."
"14719800","14721720"," You can suck a cap or going down there."
"14722340","14723880"," So a 360 350 put. "
"14724360","14727340"," Now you just go through here and like, use different numbers."
"14728040","14729700"," Start to learn just the debit put spread."
"14729960","14730140"," Nothing else. "
"14730340","14730800"," Not credit."
"14731040","14732840"," Not a credit spread."
"14733120","14733780"," Just debit puts. "
"14733780","14734760"," Call puts."
"14736420","14738440"," If you're bullish and bullish and you're like cap no matter what."
"14740040","14745080"," So and you don't want to deal with data burn and you don't want to deal with holding fucking zero"
"14745080","14749840"," dates and you don't want to deal with having to buy a six month expensive option. "
"14750160","14753300"," You're like, oh, I want to buy a in the money fucking put."
"14753440","14754920"," That's like a year out and hopefully it'll print."
"14755540","14757140"," And that's just going to cost me a big money or something. "
"14757320","14758020"," Whatever that shit is."
"14758600","14759400"," Use it by yourself."
"14759520","14759780"," Put spread. "
"14760420","14761540"," And cheaply too."
"14762360","14764040"," This puts break costs $142."
"14765300","14768400"," And if at any point we touch or go below. "
"14771280","14772600"," 35824, you're getting paid."
"14774540","14778200"," 18% chance of profit really is actually there's a risk here that you can get."
"14778680","14781060"," There's a risk that you'd have to cut a leg off on this trade. "
"14781860","14783400"," You end up going to close it on you."
"14785500","14787040"," But you get my point, right?"
"14789100","14790600"," So if we start breaking through levels."
"14791540","14793920"," You cut one side off and just keep the fucking put side. "
"14794560","14798520"," And that shit's just going to keep fucking burr, burr."
"14802100","14803640"," You guys understand what I'm saying to you?"
"14805800","14809260"," So it's called options.ai. I do not recommend them as a broker."
"14810120","14813340"," I don't even like when I say I don't recommend them as a broker. "
"14813560","14816700"," I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not affiliated with them."
"14816820","14818780"," I'm saying do not execute trades for these people."
"14819760","14820500"," Do not. "
"14821060","14822560"," If horrible fucking fills."
"14824240","14830020"," I prefer that you execute these trades on a prime bank, brokerage, or you at least use it on a"
"14830020","14831420"," broker that can help you."
"14832320","14835380"," Think or swim, I execute my stuff on those. "
"14835720","14842220"," Think of swim, tasty trade, or prime bank if they have that brokerage that you can use."
"14845540","14854400"," You can execute all these trades on I don't think you can sell spreads on this option."
"14854580","14855700"," Say I either. "
"14855840","14856400"," I don't think you can."
"14858680","14859760"," We're going to look at another one."
"14860000","14861320"," You can do a Tesla. "
"14867170","14870350"," You can just use this to find implied moves too."
"14871470","14872650"," Feel like a dumb trader?"
"14873550","14873870"," Easy."
"14874210","14875590"," You want to find an implied move in a ticker?"
"14876170","14877610"," Here's your implied moves over time. "
"14878590","14880370"," Here's your implied moves over the course of a year."
"14880950","14881490"," On Tesla."
"14885520","14890160"," If you want to trade Tesla and your bullish on Tesla, but you time in your hands, or you want"
"14890160","14893440"," to do neutral on Tesla, you guys want to get new, they offer condors. "
"14894560","14895440"," What do we got?"
"14895900","14897020"," Let's just do the 13th."
"14897820","14899800"," You don't think the Tesla's going to be above?"
"14902060","14904540"," You don't think that you go here, right?"
"14905880","14909120"," It's going to give you an iron butterfly and an iron condor."
"14909480","14910100"," Very simple. "
"14910280","14911440"," I don't recommend you trade these."
"14912520","14914720"," As they are, there's better trades than iron."
"14914880","14919360"," If you're going to go own an iron butterfly, there's lots of rules with flies and condors. "
"14919460","14924840"," You should look that up, but because you can manage this trade all along its lifespan."
"14925740","14931880"," But this is just for January 13th, and normally I wouldn't do this on Tesla's 2 volatile."
"14932400","14936780"," But if you find a stock like Clorox, let me look up Clorox real quick. "
"14939160","14943480"," Then you can do searches and find out stock tickers that tend to trade sideways."
"14947640","14948400"," Clorox bleach."
"14948980","14950540"," I think they used to trade them a long time ago. "
"14951420","14952340"," I'm at Clorox."
"14955210","14957470"," You want to see a beautiful ticker?"
"14961630","14962370"," Look at Clorox."
"14963630","14970710"," This is like a fucking, this is a theta gang fucking special right here, right?"
"14970890","14972290"," It's a total thing gang spout special. "
"14972970","14973590"," Look at that."
"14975570","14982310"," Doesn't have a lot of liquidity, but there are tickers out there that you can trade butterflies,"
"14982310","14984290"," condors on that have low volatility."
"14984650","14986030"," Sometimes they have volatility, but not often. "
"14987310","14990350"," You find a ticket to go sideways, and this gives you simplicity."
"14991790","14994730"," You can go back and do what do we say we're going to do a call spread?"
"14998650","14999870"," No, we'll go back one more."
"15001310","15003010"," I will do spy again. "
"15005710","15010150"," So you look at trade spy, and you're bullish on spy."
"15011330","15013770"," And let's say you're bullish into end of year."
"15015150","15016190"," You want to do end of year?"
"15017890","15020310"," We can do September or any minute to go back. "
"15021390","15022330"," I think that's all."
"15022450","15023690"," So this is all available here."
"15024130","15025050"," These aren't even all the strikes. "
"15026670","15027750"," What is this right here?"
"15028230","15028850"," Hold on a second."
"15028850","15030670"," This is ending in September of next year."
"15032430","15033550"," We'll do it in a standard. "
"15033930","15039330"," Well, you guys probably aren't trading spreads that far, but let's say we melt up in December 31st."
"15039950","15041370"," Take a December 30 call spread."
"15042190","15042950"," Generate some trades. "
"15045090","15048310"," You've got calls that wouldn't recommend ever buying calls through them."
"15049330","15052050"," Devic call spreads, credit put spreads."
"15053650","15054830"," You can review them here. "
"15056410","15059510"," Let me see 75% chance of winning this trade, right?"
"15059790","15060950"," You want to look at the simple trade?"
"15062770","15070470"," This is all you have to do on by December 30th, as long as you close above 392."
"15074030","15075270"," You'll make your 23 bucks."
"15075650","15077530"," I don't recommend this trade, but this is a dog shit trade. "
"15080490","15082610"," Are you going to eat all for this much lower?"
"15086330","15087710"," Let me see another debit call spread."
"15088710","15090710"," This is if you're directionally biased bullish."
"15091450","15092570"," Don't want to deal with theta burn. "
"15093010","15094910"," Don't want to deal with the zigzags all the way up."
"15096650","15099310"," Max risk, 594, max gain, 906."
"15099590","15100550"," Well, how do you apply these?"
"15101070","15103310"," I'll show you how you apply these trades, okay?"
"15103890","15104730"," Let me get out of this real quick. "
"15107870","15112250"," So how you would apply that trade or how I apply those trades is on a year chart."
"15114650","15119970"," I'm looking for, let me go back to the one day here, so you guys can stay with the regular."
"15120450","15130190"," I'll bring something else up, but that'll tell you what to do, right?"
"15130630","15131670"," You're going to sell a put. "
"15131850","15132490"," You're going to buy a call."
"15132730","15134770"," You're going to buy a put, sell a call, right?"
"15135130","15139410"," That program gives you the basic understanding of a call spread."
"15139870","15142210"," You can visualize where your profit is and your losses. "
"15142890","15146810"," You'll know when to cut your losses as you head down into a loss area."
"15147610","15150970"," You can execute them on most trading platforms, whatever you use."
"15151370","15156410"," If you have zero understanding of basic spreads, not selling them, but buying them. "
"15157270","15161270"," That's your gateway drug into simple spreads."
"15162550","15167410"," Have a little bit of a failure here on SPY, but this is how I use them."
"15167690","15175030"," So if you're going to, if I'm going to trade SPY spreads, I'm going to buy a call spread. "
"15175230","15178590"," I'm going to be looking for weakness down here, right?"
"15178710","15184190"," If we're in oversold conditions, I could put a call spread on right here with, let's say, three"
"15184190","15190370"," months on it, and I only need it usually to go from like, I usually need it to get 100 "
"15190370","15190910","% win."
"15191610","15193030"," I might need that area right there."
"15198940","15205820"," I might need to capture just this, even though the market goes up into a topping, right?"
"15205820","15209920"," Where it tops, I probably only need to capture just this amount. "
"15210900","15213280"," So if we were down here back, call spread, right?"
"15213380","15215160"," It'd be like 363, maybe to 380."
"15216460","15222320"," And I only needed to go like this high for like right here for it to print me 200%."
"15223540","15227200"," So if you're looking for like oversold conditions, overbought conditions, and you want to buy a"
"15227200","15233400"," spread because you're sure that we're going to come back and retest or you're sure that we're at"
"15233400","15235080"," least going to see an oversold bounce. "
"15235900","15243920"," If you're going to do neutral trades, if you're like, oh shit, the spy is likely going to"
"15243920","15248520"," consolidate for three or four days, you'll see theta again come in and they'll buy, buy or sell,"
"15249460","15253860"," depending on if they think it's going to rip or dip, or if it's going to trade sideways and"
"15253860","15257240"," consolidate for three or four days, butterflies and condors."
"15259040","15259380"," Thanks."
"15259520","15261460"," I'm having problems with my thanks shit here. "
"15262100","15262660"," Hold on a second."
"15263460","15270390"," Let me turn my camera back on here."
"15270510","15270750"," Hold on. "
"15273310","15274950"," Have you guys understand what I'm saying here?"
"15276290","15277210"," Who just tipped me?"
"15278190","15279590"," You guys tipped me to just subscribe."
"15280070","15280990"," You should have it right on."
"15281790","15282610"," Thank you very much. "
"15282670","15283330"," I appreciate it."
"15285350","15287250"," Let me get my camera back up and rolling here."
"15287390","15287570"," Hold on. "
"15290210","15293130"," I got like the heat cranking in this office and I got to turn the heat off."
"15293250","15294130"," I think I overheated my camera."
"15296690","15297790"," Let me turn the heat off. "
"15297910","15298230"," Hold on."
"15304730","15306570"," I got the heat blasting here this morning."
"15306890","15315990"," So my point to you is if you don't understand, if you don't understand spreads,"
"15315990","15318990"," you're like, I'm a new trader. "
"15319230","15319970"," I don't know what I'm doing."
"15319970","15324450"," I go on, I read these books and they've got all these weird graphs and stuff, and I don't know"
"15324450","15325030"," what's going on."
"15329010","15329730"," What's going on?"
"15329730","15331650"," I'm not seeing what you guys are saying in the chat. "
"15331990","15333030"," I missed a bunch of stuff."
"15333930","15335850"," Oh, Joey's in the fucking house, dude."
"15338840","15340380"," Let's see what you guys are just talking about here. "
"15341560","15342180"," Options AI."
"15342720","15344420"," I feel like we need Heisenberg on a certain principle."
"15344880","15345080"," Hi, Cap. "
"15345500","15346320"," I love options AI."
"15346740","15348400"," I got a lot of put spreads from March and June."
"15348740","15350060"," Also, some of you guys are already using it. "
"15352000","15356720"," So this is directed towards anyone that does not understand the mechanics of a spread."
"15358620","15362860"," So if you don't understand any mechanics of a spread, if you opened up a book, went to a website,"
"15363560","15368180"," watch the fucking video on YouTube, and like five minutes in, you're drooling."
"15369880","15378640"," And you're like, I still can't put three plus five times square root of 30 together and come up"
"15378640","15379380"," with an answer. "
"15379700","15382660"," Or I went to options, profit calculator as all numbers."
"15383500","15389260"," Or I went to Tastyworks and their graph systems fucking, what's this big bell curve thing they're"
"15389260","15389760"," talking about?"
"15389760","15390660"," Max profit time."
"15390960","15391960"," How long do I stay in the trade for?"
"15392060","15397280"," I'll kind of show you that you just like, I just need to have a basic understanding of the"
"15397280","15397460"," mechanics. "
"15398540","15403340"," Go to options AI and just fuck around with their setups."
"15404480","15406400"," Look at their setups, change the numbers around."
"15406740","15408120"," Look what the profit potential is. "
"15409660","15411720"," Run them through different stock tickers."
"15411940","15414700"," Start searching for stock tickers that move sideways over time."
"15417480","15422320"," When you hear people say we should have consolidation for a few days, theta gang's ears pop up. "
"15422640","15422960"," They're like, what?"
"15424000","15424400"," Consolidation."
"15425480","15426760"," When are you expecting that consolidation?"
"15427260","15428920"," I'm expecting it tomorrow into Wednesday."
"15430000","15434660"," Not, I'm not really, but if I was a theta gang member would be like, oh, fuck yeah, it's time"
"15434660","15435420"," to fucking do spreads. "
"15436440","15441600"," On the spy, and we're going to fucking smoke all these bulls and bears for like three days."
"15442220","15444000"," And they have times that they open and close them."
"15444000","15446020"," They like to open them in the opening bell. "
"15446360","15451260"," Boom, volatility, jacked up prices, jacked up premium."
"15453020","15455380"," Because all these bulls and bears are thinking we're going to rip and dip."
"15456700","15462320"," They swoop in, snatch the spread, and then they steal all your money for like three straight days. "
"15462660","15463460"," And then you close them usually."
"15463700","15464480"," Those are time sensitive."
"15464960","15467660"," So they'll end up closing, they'll open them for like one day, closing them right at the end of the"
"15467660","15467860"," day. "
"15468100","15472580"," So these are some things you need to know, but if you're just setting up or learning the mechanics"
"15472580","15478180"," of a spread, if you're a new trader, especially if you're a new trader, just have hold a naked"
"15478180","15482600"," fucking foot or longing fucking calls, anything of that kind of nonsense."
"15482940","15487800"," There's so many easier, simpler ways to express that trade where you will get fucked."
"15489460","15495280"," Especially if you're directionally right, especially if you're directionally right. "
"15496620","15502820"," If you're like, damn cap, I knew I had it right, but I got smoked because I bought the wrong"
"15502820","15509320"," option or because I had the direction right cap."
"15509520","15517400"," I just, we had a monkey wrench thrown in or some algos came in and destroyed my option."
"15517400","15518520"," They fucked my shit up cap. "
"15519880","15524900"," Then I would look towards basic spreads and just keep it simple until you learn mechanics."
"15525640","15527300"," Best times to open them, best times to close them."
"15527360","15529180"," You'll add that stuff as time comes on. "
"15529880","15531840"," You'll probably be more successful as well."
"15532920","15534700"," Trading spreads in general."
"15540020","15540620"," Delayed data. "
"15540920","15541480"," They have delayed data."
"15541720","15542540"," I didn't know they had delayed data."
"15542700","15544420"," I love some of those diagonals and buying lotos. "
"15548330","15549270"," Let's see what you guys are doing."
"15550370","15550730"," Yeah."
"15551130","15552370"," Hey Joe, how you feeling brother?"
"15558490","15560130"," Yeah, rivals saying they are slow-fills. "
"15560290","15560950"," I don't trade with them."
"15561910","15563730"," I don't trade with them for another reason."
"15564070","15568190"," I think they're part of Benzinga and I'm not a fan of Benzinga. "
"15568390","15570450"," So I don't want, I'm not giving them any fucking money anyways."
"15570450","15575010"," I'm going to assume that they are quarter-fills selling."
"15575310","15577630"," So I'm going to assume that there's scumbags. "
"15578230","15580690"," No offense if anyone likes Benzinga out there."
"15580790","15587630"," But my gut feeling is that they sell order flow just at a rate that Robinhood does."
"15594440","15596100"," Monkey brain wants dildos. "
"15596240","15597580"," Tidditch ads are Zenos fuck."
"15605480","15606360"," Yeah, it's free."
"15607280","15608840"," Hey Benny Maxx in the house too. "
"15608940","15609720"," Everybody's in here, huh?"
"15609900","15610520"," Chas is in here."
"15610620","15611280"," Joe's in here."
"15612120","15612780"," Nice slow day. "
"15613020","15613760"," Benny Maxx in here."
"15613900","15615340"," All the heavy hitters are in here."
"15616880","15619500"," Whoever subscribed or whatever, I appreciate it. "
"15619880","15620440"," Sergio, you subscribed."
"15620860","15621180"," Thank you."

"15623880","15624480"," I appreciate it."

"15630540","15631840"," Murak Benke, Mike. "
"15632640","15633440"," Mike Shangrilla."
"15634200","15635460"," Just some guy, baby."
"15636100","15636760"," He tipped yesterday. "

"15644500","15646320"," There's Donny putting down in the description. "
"15646980","15648720"," If you're a poor trader, you don't owe me shit."
"15648900","15649860"," Don't ever tip me."
"15650300","15652940"," If you start making money though, try to help support the channel. "
"15652980","15654320"," It does cost to put the stuff out."
"15654960","15656520"," Spend the time with you guys here every day."
"15657040","15657760"," We're going to slow day today. "
"15657760","15661600"," It's a good time to do some school work, right?"
"15662320","15663740"," Especially for new people joining us."
"15665100","15667240"," If you're poor, at least give the thumbs up."
"15667620","15668820"," Tell your friends about what we're doing. "
"15670560","15672600"," Go out there and be like, hey, I know this guy's live streaming."
"15673220","15673580"," He sucks."
"15673660","15674560"," I fade him every day. "
"15675420","15676000"," Don't tell him that."
"15676960","15678280"," Tell him whatever you want."
"15688740","15690440"," Give me the zero day to IV to my veins. "
"15693420","15697400"," We're going to do a class at some point that I'm going to record with you and I'll package it"
"15697400","15698220"," up and push it out."
"15699060","15700140"," We'll do like legit classes."
"15700360","15704320"," We should do this today, but I wasn't thinking about doing it today. "
"15704940","15710780"," What we'll do is one of these days we'll start making classes soon."
"15712820","15714120"," Today would have been a perfect day."
"15716340","15717800"," Oh yeah, Benny Mac just tipped. "
"15719000","15720660"," Benny Mac out there supporting the cause."
"15721400","15722120"," Fucking love you, bro."
"15727440","15733020"," But you know, anyone that doesn't, if you don't, if you're just like trading stock and you want to"
"15733020","15737320"," get into options, if you're, if you're just Tony Cheese, baby. "
"15738740","15740960"," Tony Cheese just just lit me up with some cash."
"15741860","15743720"," Did you light me up with the 42069?"
"15745500","15748100"," Was that you that gave me 420 the other day for 20 cents?"
"15748260","15748560"," That was awesome."
"15748720","15749140"," Whoever did that. "
"15751240","15752160"," Tony Cheese, man."
"15754500","15758980"," So, you know, if you're, if you're just a stock buyer seller, Joey Harper, brother."
"15759980","15761720"," Joey Harper just supported the channel. "
"15762700","15764680"," I read your message just now, Joe."
"15765420","15766560"," Give me a shout later."
"15768080","15772600"," But when you, you know, if you guys are losing money all the time on options, like I just bought"
"15772600","15774620"," a bunch of weeklies on spy. "
"15775840","15778340"," There's so many better ways to express that trade."
"15779660","15782320"," Especially with spreads, credit spreads fucking rule."
"15783120","15784220"," Credit spreads are directional. "
"15785000","15786040"," They start fucking cranking."
"15786500","15789640"," If you're in your direction, you watch your spreads just start printing."
"15789940","15792360"," They don't, they're not as, well, you get a lot of time. "
"15792720","15794640"," You gain money on time on credit spreads."
"15795040","15800300"," But if you, if you like the times burning out and it's going in the direction that you want, you'll"
"15800300","15802020"," have like a credit spread that's fucking basically worthless."
"15802720","15805580"," And it just starts fucking hammering printing hammering. "
"15816930","15818890"," So, I don't know, and you'll get it."
"15819050","15823230"," You don't need to be, people complicate how to interpret or use spreads."
"15824330","15825130"," Just practice. "
"15826470","15829170"," I don't think the thing you can pay for trade on that company."
"15830150","15835730"," But if you at least like, if you spend 100 bucks on a simple trade for a $300 payout and"
"15835730","15839950"," you're, and you're not hitting 300, 300 percent wins all the time."
"15840650","15841970"," What's a hundred bucks on a, on a spread?"
"15842290","15842490"," It's easy. "
"15843910","15845090"," It's, it's a no brainer."
"15849050","15852950"," You'll see people in the market, they'll trade spreads like a, um, if you don't know the direction"
"15852950","15858150"," of the, of the market, you'll see them by, uh, like a put spread and a call spread."
"15858790","15861170"," Put a little bit of time on them and you hope both sides hit, right?"
"15861330","15863710"," The first side hits, you get paid 300 percent. "
"15864790","15865470"," Take that money."
"15865910","15866990"," You paid for your other one, right?"
"15868410","15872410"," So yesterday, you could have printed the call side."
"15874290","15878570"," Or anytime, now it's how much strangles and straddles, but you print the call side and then you"
"15878570","15880310"," just, and you've got a free put spread now. "
"15882750","15887290"," And you just hope that it comes back down to print it, or at least get out of it."
"15888910","15890290"," So you don't lose all your money, right?"
"15892930","15898350"," And you can start developing strategies to catch both moves, catch the up move, catch the down"
"15898350","15898630"," move."
"15898630","15903010"," Put enough time on both those spreads and they'll both fucking likely hit. "
"15903510","15905570"," I love doing strangles and straddles and spreads."
"15906130","15906610"," Love them."
"15907630","15913010"," Oftentimes people will just buy the, the call and the put, uh, though that's a very, that's a very"
"15913010","15915190"," stressful, uh, trade to manage. "
"15916330","15923600"," And you don't always capture a ton of money, but like a put and call, straddle in the market is"
"15923600","15924420"," fucking baller."
"15925940","15927780"," And those aren't that complicated either."
"15928440","15934100"," And then once you figure it out, you'll start to manage both sides of that trade within, what"
"15934100","15938480"," you're owning and selling, paying on the move, which way the move is going. "
"15943430","15948830"," My, if there was, there'd be a couple of basic rules if you've never traded spreads."
"15949230","15958910"," Number one, would be trade a stock that closes to cash, and it's best"
"15958910","15961050"," if it doesn't have dividends."
"15962010","15967910"," Those would be the basic rules, uh, and it's, it's liquid, not illiquid, but liquid. "
"15968970","15976370"," The last rule would be on the expiry of that spread, always close it."
"15977190","15979330"," I don't care if you close it at fucking 359."
"15980450","15984690"," You close that fucking spread on the day of expiry. "
"15985050","15987630"," Don't ever, ever let that spread expire."
"15989510","15991750"," You can write that down in a piece of paper, that stuff."
"15993470","15998630"," Uh, share or stock that's liquid has lots of people coming in and out. "
"16001460","16006880"," Is it, these are directional spreads, bull and bull, bull and bear, liquid, closes to cash."
"16008060","16009180"," You can look that up on a ticker."
"16009920","16011160"," Does this ticker close to cash or not?"
"16014580","16015920"," Preferable that it doesn't have dividends. "
"16018260","16022740"," Always close your spreads, at least by the last minute of the trading day, and expiring."
"16023540","16029400"," I think that would be my rules, and you can look that up on your own, why that is."
"16029400","16032800"," I'm not going to explain that to you why now you can do that on, on your own, but just"
"16032800","16033620"," getting into spreads. "
"16033900","16039760"," That's so, and so a prime choice would be, a prime choice would be spot."
"16043120","16044080"," IWM, QQQs."
"16047940","16054320"," You don't want to be typically, you don't want to be buying fucking condors and fucking flies on"
"16056080","16058180"," highly volatile tickers. "
"16058600","16060180"," That's another rule for sideways stuff."
"16066150","16069250"," When you start selling these spreads, right, you're going to need to get a margin account."
"16069910","16073990"," And I'm not going to talk to you about selling spreads because it can be very dangerous. "
"16077160","16083840"," If you ever find that a broker has closed a leg of your trade, one warning I would give you,"
"16083900","16087600"," if you've never traded a spread, I want you to take this to the bank, okay, I want you to"
"16087600","16088940"," imprint this in your brain."
"16091460","16096540"," If you, sometimes if you, these are like two more rules, hit a bunch of rules, like another rule"
"16096540","16103060"," would be, if you earn the money, so number one, a rule that I have, most spreads."
"16105120","16106220"," Let me explain this to you. "
"16107160","16111140"," Okay, so can you see that?"
"16111360","16112060"," No, you can't see that."
"16112660","16113020"," Hold on a second."
"16114660","16115740"," Give me one second here. "
"16115800","16117000"," I want to give you one more rule."
"16117120","16118480"," It's important or a set of rules."
"16120780","16130490"," If not always, but like debit spreads, debit spreads, if you start the spread here,"
"16130930","16137310"," and this is where the spread ends, most spreads, you're likely going to see if you're directly"
"16137310","16143990"," right, you'll see like 50% of that trade within the first quarter to a third of its life. "
"16145650","16146350"," Not always."
"16146750","16147750"," I'm going to just hit 100% before."
"16149050","16152930"," You likely won't see the rest of it until the end of its life. "
"16155410","16161530"," So for me, I like to close them and re-enter a second one, a third one, and a fourth"
"16161530","16164730"," one with big time on them, but I'll collect the 50 like four times."
"16166390","16167870"," It's a horrible number right there."
"16169050","16169870"," Does that make sense?"
"16171350","16177230"," Rather than staying in the trade, the full length, right?"
"16177630","16178090"," Have time?"
"16178590","16181950"," They'll be buying the same amount of time in each trade, but I'm closing them before. "
"16182370","16183690"," Like, boom, a half percent of closing it."
"16184250","16185130"," Take my money and I'm running."
"16185370","16186070"," Take my money and I'm running. "
"16186290","16187110"," Take my money and I'm running."
"16187350","16188210"," Take my money and I'm running."
"16190330","16191130"," So time. "
"16193390","16193790"," Sorry."
"16194610","16204590"," The other rule would be, the other rule would be, let's say you can make a hundred"
"16204590","16210800"," bucks on your trade, let's say you risk a hundred and you're going to make a hundred."
"16212020","16216840"," The moment you come in the money to that hundred dollars, the moment you're like your max gain,"
"16217300","16218940"," close the entire thing right then and there. "
"16220960","16228620"," If you don't and whatever ticket you're trading in it with a spread, and let's say it's still going"
"16228620","16233400"," in the direction that you want it to be, a broker will come in in the back end and you'll"
"16233400","16238160"," see that your broker will close the leg of your spread and your spread will show up and it'll say"
"16238160","16241720"," like, you owe a million dollars today."
"16242320","16247280"," People freak out and like kill themselves at night time and not realize the next morning that you"
"16247280","16249760"," didn't go like a million dollars."
"16250360","16253260"," The other part of that too is you can be on the trade too. "
"16253700","16256760"," Depending upon the circumstances, if it's going against you, you can get fucked."
"16258200","16260000"," That's another step with this video side that rule."
"16260120","16261640"," Trade's really going outside of the bounds. "
"16261780","16263940"," You might have to cut a leg loose so that you don't get caught."
"16264100","16264980"," That's with margin and shit."
"16266100","16271020"," I don't think you need a margin count for buying or just buying basic spreads. "
"16274940","16276560"," It doesn't really apply to you."
"16280420","16282740"," Okay, I close my spreads at 50% gains."
"16283140","16285860"," If you go to 100% gains, do not hold them past that. "
"16286580","16290800"," Like right when you hit 100% you close them and time is money."
"16292780","16293180"," Absolutely."
"16293460","16294100"," Tohichi's got that. "
"16294220","16294540"," Has that right?"
"16296360","16299700"," If you're selling spreads, that's a completely different animal."
"16300100","16307340"," That would take like a series of classes because it was real danger in selling spreads and it's not"
"16307340","16308880"," something we want to discuss with a new trader."
"16309360","16312240"," I'd make a video or something you can watch it and with a bunch of disclaimers on it. "
"16312440","16316480"," There's a guy that I like more to describe that stuff if you want to get into complicated trading"
"16316480","16323440"," strategies there's a guy on YouTube from tasty he's got blonde herring glasses I forget his name I"
"16323440","16333210"," do recommend him I love cover calls love cash cash covered puts"
"16333210","16342170"," cash secured puts are awesome too they're fucking awesome but if you just have no no idea about"
"16342170","16348770"," trading spreads start to learn how to trade a debit call a debit put spread then learn about credit"
"16348770","16355770"," spreads start trading those with small money if you can pick the direction and time those are two"
"16355770","16361330"," simple things right two simple things to find information on the internet about if we're oversold"
"16361330","16371250"," if were overbought in a time frame you can and you place that trade for that time frame you have"
"16371250","16377370"," a high chance of winning if you're pulling if you're taking a spread on a year time frame and"
"16377370","16388450"," you're in oversold conditions you have a high rate of winning that trade if you"
"16388450","16392849"," want to learn some goofy complicated shit watch CNBC at five thirty and Fridays every week they"
"16392849","16400130"," have an options only show it's only 30 minutes long Winky's putting that info out thanks Winky"
"16408009","16415050"," theta gang is ruling the day today H.P.M. theta gang is just smoking bulls and bears picking"
"16415050","16423750"," directions we're in consolidation right now we got shit going on in the market we started AMC"
"16423750","16434890"," earlier nothing going on bro not a thing do I"
"16434890","16444849"," still use spot camera no I so I I like their data I don't like"
"16444849","16453710"," their I don't like I don't like their view on the market I'll leave it there"
"16453710","16460770"," I'm not a fan of you I feel like they poisoned my brain so now I get my own data"
"16460770","16470689"," from the CME every morning I download the CME data every single morning I pop it into"
"16470689","16478710"," a spread sheet and I don't my daughter's working on a supposedly she's working on some gamma tools"
"16478710","16490740"," for us to have so we'll have free gamma tools kind of cool yeah"
"16490740","16497880"," I can't do it man like those and do Brent's fucking awesome I can't do like the they were hit"
"16497880","16503300"," me for like I think it's like 30 bucks for this then it's like 69 dollars for this fucking hero"
"16503300","16508300"," indicator then it's like oh you want this new thing it's another hundred bucks now you know it I'm"
"16508300","16513000"," like like wait a minute I'm spending through two 300 bucks a month in this fucking service and then"
"16513000","16518160"," of course I'm reading their daily briefs Winky's in the chat right now Winky and I used to dissect"
"16518160","16525840"," those fucking things Winky and I tracked the daily briefs and then a day briefs and Winky's here"
"16525840","16532980"," right now so he can have tested this they would always miss critical move like like a day and then"
"16532980","16540599"," you're like fuck I missed it because I read that stupid fucking brief so I don't know there's a"
"16540599","16548900"," great guys tons of respect for him if you guys find value out of them that's awesome for me I"
"16548900","16558779"," feel like they're a dollar late and day short or something so Winky if I send"
"16558779","16563900"," you the script would you help me with it I think I'm having problems with the the root where I'm"
"16563900","16572000"," having the problems is I think it's because I'm using a I remember I like Spock and I like how"
"16572000","16576720"," they come you are always on the inverse and the guy was like actually we gave you both the up"
"16576720","16581000"," and down yeah that was the other part of what I didn't like about Spock and Spock and was never"
"16581000","16588480"," like that's a fair point Winky I remember that Spock and would be like how they worded their daily"
"16588480","16595500"," briefs they worded them they worded them first so they could get out of having said I feel like"
"16595500","16600360"," this right feel like that so you'd read it and be like oh they're definitely leaning towards we're"
"16600360","16605240"," going down tomorrow and they would have like some disclaimer in there and then of course you're"
"16605240","16609460"," biased that way so then you come back and the one that burned me what pissed me off was that"
"16609460","16615540"," people like hey man you're biased this way what happened and instead of just saying well this"
"16615540","16621380"," happened and so we changed our bias or updating hey we're changing our bias here or any way to"
"16621380","16631300"," change bias they would instead fucking double down and be like fuck you and so"
"16631300","16640650"," I was like yeah you know what fuck you then I'm out of here yeah the number one goal was"
"16640650","16646110"," never be wrong or it wasn't I didn't really I didn't really had a problem with him being wrong I"
"16646110","16650410"," had a problem that they couldn't come to you and say before it even happened hey look cap or hey"
"16650410","16656849"," subscriber I've changed my bias or something happened you wouldn't hear about it's like a day later"
"16656849","16663369"," or after market close they'd say fuck you too so it's like that you get the wound and then you"
"16663369","16668189"," get the fucking salt in the wound and I was like oh fuck you how about that I don't fucking"
"16668189","16673890"," need to be doing this shit with you it was yeah it was the double speak and then the hammer"
"16673890","16679210"," and then the worst part was that there was no outlet for them to get to you and say hey"
"16679210","16685910"," look we've got a gamma flip or hey look the market went the other way we want you to know"
"16685910","16693250"," right now as it's happening so you could at least be like oh shit thanks for the heads up instead"
"16693250","16698390"," it was did you get fucked right in the close did you get fucked right into tomorrow well fuck you"
"16698390","16708230"," too see but god damn it if they change that aspect of their service"
"16708230","16716810"," where they could instantly email you instantly text you or they had a fucking live stream or a"
"16716810","16724230"," fucking their their Twitter handle is like kind of there sometimes and kind of isn't sometimes you"
"16724230","16728169"," get the the changes but sometimes you don't get them feel like I who's running the ship over there"
"16728169","16734630"," like fucking who's really running the ship is there some guy there all day every day I don't know"
"16742360","16749020"," that would be fine right that would make that service fucking baller I would go back in a minute if"
"16749020","16754380"," they could if they could literally have a way to contact you and just a quick text message hey man"
"16754380","16761279"," our models have flipped hey man our models have changed just that warning would be fucking great"
"16761279","16771099"," then their shit would be fucking tits tits McGee cuz they don't do it you they like you"
"16771099","16780100"," stay in it go they're right I'm sure they're right here indicator takes time sometimes for the role"
"16780100","16787160"," to happen all it's showing is monetizing of calls and buying of puts or like selling calls buying"
"16787160","16793180"," puts selling puts buying calls that's what it's inferring and sometimes it takes time for the role"
"16793180","16801830"," to happen or the bottom to happen I'm not shitting on them either they do good they do good stuff"
"16801830","16807430"," I don't want to sound so negative on Spock Emma they could be that one of the best services out"
"16807430","16812830"," there if that was the one part I guess you get some of that in the discord discord somewhat knows"
"16812830","16818490"," what's up but I don't like the discord community as much as I used to at the time so I"
"16818490","16822210"," just didn't think it was worth the money I was like you know what rather than getting their bias"
"16822210","16826790"," and rather just get the fucking rather just get the gamma data every day look at it and say okay"
"16826790","16834150"," this is where all the gamma levels are weak weak yeah I'll try to text you or something how I'm"
"16834150","16840110"," doing this I'm thinking I'm having a problem cuz I'm not using Excel and I'm having like data"
"16840110","16848310"," transfer problem I'm not maybe I'm not fluent enough in the Google version of Excel and Google"
"16848310","16858210"," whatever it's called sheets I'm having like data clunkiness I'll send you the stuff man maybe"

"16873830","16880210"," know maybe work work something out or figure it out and I just want to give it to people I"
"16880210","16884270"," don't want you to have to pay 30 bucks a month or some nonsense we'll put it in brief every"
"16884270","16889310"," morning with the levels so you can actually see it and then we could you know be really cool we"
"16889310","16895290"," could write a we could write some script for a trading view so that you get the level if you"
"16895290","16901430"," get those gamma levels if we get those gamma levels every day you could just copy and paste into a"
"16901430","16907110"," script a pine script on trading view and you could bam have the levels every single day ready to go"
"16907110","16919110"," and be free be fucking super cool yeah"
"16919110","16929080"," yeah what you do is you you'd open up trading view in the morning you'd open up the pine"
"16929080","16935200"," whatever pine script scripted right and like the top left hand side you just click on it and you'd"
"16935200","16942060"," cut and paste the gamma levels in every day and matter of fact if you did it if we did"
"16942060","16949620"," it every morning and you just give access to I don't know supporters or something they could just"
"16949620","16959440"," come in every morning and have access to those levels on spx and and and Q and RT and all"
"16959440","16969070"," those all that shit yeah I so you get the data you can download the data into a"
"16969070","16978950"," download the data into an excel sheet you create these tables and it implies it's not"
"16978950","16987030"," it's not it's an implied where the gamma is you don't know exactly what they're doing but it"
"16987030","16992050"," creates these tables and you take tables and you write a simple script for it and expresses it in a"
"16992050","16997290"," chart in a gamut chart you can actually express it a bunch of ways there's a bunch of different"
"16997290","17004190"," scripts you can use you can make really cool looking ones simple ones for the for the crayon you"
"17004190","17012580"," crayon eaters we have that at trading ticks"
"17012580","17015400"," shout"

"17037160","17047840"," make it public so we'll put it out there for you every morning and we'll"
"17047840","17052640"," grab the data every day and we'll post it same thing with I know a little bit of a fine"
"17052640","17058760"," script editor my dope my daughter is just learning it so hopefully we can get there and Apple just"
"17058760","17068460"," turn green or they're turning red maybe I don't know yeah just turning green now Apple fighting"
"17068460","17077130"," back or losing a little bit I guess maybe turning red so yeah that's some of the stuff we want"
"17077130","17083790"," to run out or get to get to you guys I'd really like to release that data to you and"
"17083790","17088550"," not have I'd really like to like release it to you and not have a bias on it for you"
"17088550","17095530"," just be like here it is it's raw you decide what it means on your own because I always feel"
"17095530","17102550"," like I always feel like that the gamma readings can be wrong they have a high probability of not"
"17102550","17109550"," being wrong but they're like a useful tool but I wouldn't base all of my trading on that tool you"
"17111820","17123270"," want to go back and look at AMC here's"
"17123270","17133020"," AMC right and right off that 100 day five-minute chart"
"17151720","17158540"," if they don't double top here you're gonna see a squeeze higher if all these trap sellers up here"
"17158540","17168510"," don't fucking they don't take in if they can diamond hand oh no I know guys that"
"17168510","17178240"," do Troy but I don't yeah they've got some places above they're above you know they're above above"
"17178240","17184520"," their their applied move for the day here there are some spots above you want to see them they're"
"17184520","17193450"," really high if they break out of this if they break out from here"
"17193450","17202990"," they've got targets of $16 $19 $23 I'm doubting that happens"
"17202990","17210130"," but if they do break out here it's gonna get really squeezy above here like really squeezy like"
"17210130","17223260"," moon shot moon they will fuck it'll fucking moon it'll blast"
"17223260","17233790"," off anything above here this is"
"17233790","17241670"," the implied move we measured this earlier wait a minute so you guys can't steal this for them so we"
"17241670","17247910"," measured this earlier and this is about half of them this is about half of the move down from over"
"17247910","17257350"," here we measured this move this is about 50% to the move it's like 60% might be like"
"17257350","17266450"," what is that 10 bucks 70% 12 bucks so we'll start cranking"
"17266450","17276210"," we think I think 50% right around nine bucks it's like five over here and then the top was"

"20538560","20546160"," important okay a lot a lot a longer time frame I want to switch over we could start selling here"
"20546160","20550680"," I want to talk to you about this is we're a pretty important moment okay be very careful if you"
"20550680","20558120"," long calls right now and I'm gonna explain it to you here better but it's a it's a tough so"
"20558120","20568090"," there's two ways to interpret the information here okay we see if I can show"
"20568090","20580820"," it to you give me just a second here okay there's two"
"20580820","20588770"," ways to interpret this in from the market profile is the showing that there's two two viewpoints on"
"20588770","20597030"," this okay so we traded down over here right yeah or you can see the time that we spent and"
"20597030","20603750"," could show us in a better time frame so we spent a lot of time down here right pushed up"
"20603750","20611170"," didn't find the support that we needed came back down right pushed up and found support so that the"
"20611170","20617590"," implication would be you're watching my cursor right that this is the new level and this level is a"
"20617590","20630370"," 402 okay see my point here and so there's an argument to be made that we'll sell"
"20630370","20639730"," down here somewhere they're claiming 396 is the is the value area before we settle in on this being"
"20639730","20649480"," the new zone we kind of already did that down here"
"20649480","20654280"," man we've done that a couple times so there's an art there's a small like it are you to make"
"20654280","20659340"," that know all this new volume in the market we're gonna try to beat up and create a new level"
"20659340","20666800"," kind of leave a gap down here not really a gap we spent"
"20666800","20676800"," a lot of so we spent a lot of time down here that's"
"20676800","20683100"," a fuck ton of time and so there's you know like there's a from market profile perspective you're"
"20683100","20690440"," saying well we've got the yeah like this is the constant fucking bear argument and you know the"
"20690440","20700420"," bear argument is like well we spent all this time here and we just defended this right I want you"
"20700420","20705640"," to see this important that you see this because what what what market profiles gonna tell you is"
"20705640","20710100"," gonna tell you volume pros gonna tell you is now we're gonna come back down here and just check"
"20710100","20713400"," this one more time and then they can move up it's always constantly come back and check come back"
"20713400","20720140"," check so this is like this is like a this new level above us and you know you see this"
"20720140","20729220"," move right here right well the claim would be well we've already done this but there's a lot of"
"20729220","20734660"," coiling in here and it hasn't been a huge move higher so there is a possibility of a squeeze up"
"20734660","20739480"," higher for us to actually have a higher level so you so if you're looking at how what I've got"
"20739480","20747240"," written there right you'd say well we're really not at a higher level yet so maybe you do your"
"20747240","20752440"," you're actually you're actually not looking for distribution down here you're actually looking to"
"20752440","20759580"," fucking break out into a new trading area above here so you get the squeeze and then you come back"
"20759580","20764880"," down and do some distribution in here or at least try to create a new level now if you talk"
"20764880","20769840"," to a bear right now or even you know even a market profile kind of guy they're gonna try to"
"20769840","20774100"," tell you well no we're gonna come back down in this zone this was your this is all you get"
"20774100","20780500"," bull but dude that volume yesterday would would would would disagree with that and they're gonna"
"20780500","20788180"," tell you it's actually up here accepting a new level and that fucking new level you know 402 to 408"
"20788180","20792380"," they're saying nope this is your new level 10 points that's it I think normally I would agree with"
"20792380","20798060"," that I don't know this is a tough place man this is a tough place because I think the argument"
"20798060","20804160"," for distribution in here is normal circumstances that's possible the volume that came into the"
"20804160","20809540"," market yesterday and of course people like market structure is fucking dog shit right now fucking"
"20809540","20818220"," you want to see the fucking market structure fucking see this fucking that giant fucking green bar"
"20818220","20823120"," right there when we should have rolled the market over I told you know we're going higher we should"
"20823120","20828520"," not have had that green bar yesterday so I don't know if the market structure is completely dogs"
"20828520","20834540"," just matter of fucking fact you see this declining volume over here after this move see this one"
"20834540","20841260"," right here we still went up down and smashed higher so we could see something like that but still"
"20841260","20848160"," this grind higher and then a smash you know even if you mimic this right here there's still this"
"20848160","20853140"," first leg and then see this bar right here this is the extra squeeze higher that they got this is"
"20853140","20858220"," the second day of that squeeze see what I'm saying so you're not going just right here you're gonna"
"20858220","20864020"," actually push up and smash up above and then consolidate above this is a tricky place for the"
"20864020","20870640"," market right now I can't really say where we're going if we're gonna just I can't really tell you"
"20870640","20878280"," that you know that this is gonna get rolled or if it's done creating its new trading zone if you"
"20878280","20882840"," think to the argument be well do you want that new level it's gonna be four hundred to four goddamn"
"20882840","20890300"," ten I'm like I don't know I think the new level is could be four ten and higher"
"20890300","20898860"," you'll know if it if we fucking break up there it'll make us it will sneak attack up there the"
"20898860","20904260"," the P I don't want to say the PJ traders but the robots will push it up there and see"
"20904260","20910800"," if we want that because you can see we tried it here we made an attempt and it was immediately"
"20910800","20916880"," sold down they might I would say they're gonna make at least one more attack for four ten if they"
"20916880","20925940"," get told no then we'll come back down so they're gonna make one more one more attempt at least if"
"20927570","20935830"," they don't find it I'll give you that I'll give you your rollover so I would I would say to"
"20935830","20942970"," you hear that if these sellers stay in charge right if these sellers that are here telling you how"
"20942970","20947910"," no you're not going into you're not gonna trade 410 420 right you're gonna need us at least a"
"20947910","20957750"," second you're not doing this and then you'll get your distribution or you'll you'll try try"
"20957750","20967690"," to hold 400 to 410 and we can look at that we can look at that bearish case I'm"
"20967690","20972990"," down look I love I don't mind looking at the bearish case it's a lot not bearish but consolidation"
"20972990","20979710"," case so if you had like three or four days of consolidation or five days of consolidation doesn't"
"20979710","20989610"," turn into distribution you'll be looking for let's let's redraw this stuff here because"
"20989610","20999210"," we can't because of where we are so 394 I think just call it a flat"
"20999210","21008860"," 400 this kind of that this kind of the bearish bullish case this is the"
"21008860","21016500"," reasonable bull case too but what they're what they're trying to say is that or the market profile"
"21016500","21028220"," is trying some same day that 410 is a no-go somewhere in"
"21028220","21036160"," here you could even you could even argue that it's somewhere even lower in that it's in that for"
"21036160","21044420"," it's right at 410 you could just you could just argue it's 410 and you make this red let me"
"21044420","21053880"," give you a visual representation of what levels we have and the argument would be that you have to"
"21053880","21058120"," get some time down here bowls before you can make your next leg higher I'm not in disagreement with"
"21058120","21065820"," that but how you can you can easily go back and the volume that we had yesterday and this volume"
"21065820","21071240"," push back there it's it's nothing to so there's an attempt right now to go like that what's what's"
"21071240","21076660"," happening is there's an attempt to say no we're going up we're gonna get smashed down and this is"
"21076660","21082340"," our new level to trade to make that attempt to close a gap in 20s you see what I'm saying"
"21082340","21090760"," so it's like to there's an attempt to go higher to get definitely get rejected and consolidate and"
"21090760","21096040"," there's another thought process that we don't that we actually spend time here this is where the"
"21096040","21109800"," this we get bears right there for consolidation trends into distribution market"
"21109800","21115360"," structure I don't know if the market structure is that bad though do a volume B profile do a B"
"21115360","21123100"," profile I don't know I'm not I'm not like I'm not gonna say tell you that I'm I'm like a"
"21123100","21133040"," fucking expert on market profile and I know for a fact that you can you can definitely"
"21133040","21139740"," squeeze up here and then come in here I think I saw Chase say something about the mark his point"
"21139740","21143320"," would be that you do something in the overnight you squeeze up and in cash market that's where they"
"21143320","21148000"," sell it down right there and then you fight for this if you can't hold it then we'll start going"
"21148000","21155180"," down I think that's the argument that they could be scary up in here I agree with that that works"
"21155180","21164140"," for me I can get down with that I feel that I feel you Chase and then there's the other"
"21164140","21170000"," trap right that's the bull trap that's what that's what happened here you had the potential to go"
"21170000","21174640"," up and said they set you down and there goes your consolidation right there you see that right"
"21174640","21182860"," there this would be the this is this argument right here again so this this would be a repeat of"
"21182860","21188960"," this move right here right but man I'll tell you what this is where the fucking this is where we"
"21188960","21196740"," already here we already did this shit I'm kind of like I would suspect that this could get bearish"
"21196740","21202460"," quick down here because we've already been here oh no maybe it does take two or three weeks to"
"21202460","21210400"," consolidate at this level I don't know what to say the way that speech was and the way this volume"
"21210400","21217340"," was here I have a hard time with not having a gap up and tomorrow may I get it I"
"21217340","21222940"," get you understand we're already selling off here get rid of this I don't know what this line came"
"21222940","21230220"," from they're gonna want to if you if you want to if you if you're gonna bear and you want"
"21230220","21238560"," to take this trade into like next Wednesday or Friday like a five day consolidation or three-day"
"21238560","21244620"," down day I'll tell you what man we had a one day of up we go three days up right"
"21244620","21253400"," you get three but three bar pattern fucking three bar trade you get fucking smoked so I don't know"
"21253400","21261040"," I don't know what the answer is right here I'm trying to I'm trying to figure this out my brain"

"21447010","21455350"," some kind of a consolidation trade in here like a call spread for higher numbers ticks right ticks"

"21479750","21489030"," to hold it for the time maybe the next Friday or something a Friday expiry for next week"
"21489030","21495850"," in case we have we show some weakness and some consolidation down here there's a case we made to"

"21526320","21531320"," there for that there would be consolidation above without with a hundred percent you get the three"
"21531320","21540320"," bar trade you then start put position so if you look at options you could sit in your hands wait"
"21540320","21550060"," and see in short the gap tomorrow the gap up you could sit on your hands and short that gap"
"21550060","21558800"," up or you could if we go down instead you would want to enter a long long call spread here"
"21558800","21565720"," if you didn't want to sit in your hands call spreads probably the most the safest with time on it"
"21565720","21573060"," like a week next Friday because you capture either that either or the put spread or puts here they"
"21573060","21577300"," have a good chance of printing but not guaranteed if you get the gap up they're burned and gone if"
