"59910","63010"," I can't you guys might be able to hear me right now with a shitty microphone."
"69930","74470"," You guys might be able to hear me now with the shitty ass mic that I have."
"77050","78570"," Now I got my shit in a ponytail. "
"82760","83700"," No, no sound."
"85260","86420"," You hear me now, right?"
"88260","90440"," Okay, so my microphone is fucked up."
"90640","92780"," It's like I've got a fucked up mic right now. "
"96260","97860"," Yeah, it sounds like a tin can, right?"
"100900","105960"," Yeah, it's because it's not my it's not my fucking it's not my mic."
"105960","107560"," It's my camera microphone."
"113050","115430"," Hold on here. "
"115570","116290"," Give me just a second."
"116530","117030"," See you guys here."
"117390","118190"," Just you guys can know. "
"118330","125110"," I know my voice sounds like dog shit right now, but my mic sucks right now."
"125150","125830"," I can't believe it."
"126890","128250"," I think I know what it is. "
"128490","129949"," I've had this happen before."
"137400","138480"," You guys hear me now?"
"138760","141920"," No, check this one real quick."
"144800","147140"," Alright, so I'm gonna give you guys, I'm gonna hang up with you, right Chas?"
"147480","149280"," Because I gotta get through this stuff for everybody. "
"150400","152680"," I appreciate it, man."
"153360","154120"," I'll clear it back."
"155960","163780"," Alright everybody out there, this sucks because I've got a mic problem and it's not the first time"
"163780","164860"," I've had this mic problem. "
"164860","166360"," I forget what the reason is."
"168160","169020"," No, wait a minute."
"169700","170440"," Hold on. "
"173140","174040"," Disabled, disabled."
"175140","181880"," Kind of pissed off, but I forget the reason why this is, but we're gonna go with what we've got"
"181880","182380"," going on."
"182620","183180"," Fuck this mic. "
"184400","187940"," So we're gonna go with what we have happening right now."
"188660","190380"," So I want you guys to see out there."
"190720","193260"," There's a couple of important things I want you guys to be looking for right now. "
"193920","195520"," First off, how's everybody doing?"
"195520","196940"," Hope you're all doing well."
"198020","201640"," Yeah, so the mic sounds raw because I've got a mic issue."
"203120","206520"," It's something with that resets and they're gonna go back in a reset. "
"206700","208560"," It's just stupid fucking OBS shit."
"208920","210480"," I didn't come here."
"210640","211920"," I forgot my shit in a ponytail. "
"213180","214300"," So we're gonna take a look here."
"214440","217580"," I want you guys to see that there are buyers down below down here at 380."
"217580","220140"," 380 to 50 or so. "
"220980","222760"," You'll see buyers as well."
"228580","229940"," You guys hear all that?"
"232480","238040"," We're gonna go through some stuff here, some important stuff that we haven't had a chance to talk"
"238040","238360"," about."
"239700","242020"," So I did buy this bottom just so you know. "
"242280","248880"," I bought calls here at 380 to 50 and I'm gonna add more calls at 380 flat."
"251760","257480"," So if you're out there and you're wondering if you should have bought that bottom or not with Chaz"
"257480","260220"," on the phone I did buy some calls at 380."
"260820","265840"," There were 385 C's expiring today and I'll add some more here at 380. "
"268840","274200"," If we trade back down retest the low possibly and you can see these buyers down below and you can"
"274200","278560"," also see we've actually had real money buyers all day long on the spy."
"279900","283860"," The spy though has had rolling puts coming into it."
"284240","285640"," So we're gonna talk about that stuff. "
"285820","287000"," We're gonna talk about where we're headed."
"287700","290460"," I'm gonna start off, I'm gonna start off with you guys."
"290720","292060"," We're gonna take a look at some charts here. "
"293640","296560"," And I need to get through this today if I can."
"296740","305840"," You know as a matter of fact I'm gonna do, I think I need to give me what I'm gonna"
"305840","306320"," do is this."
"306320","310180"," I'm gonna turn the stream off one more time. "
"310180","312580"," I really apologize for this for having a bad stream."
"313100","318680"," I'm gonna turn this stream off one more time and I'm gonna reset this fucking OBS studio bullshit"
"318680","321040"," because I know exactly what's going on with it."
"322680","325400"," But I have to turn off the stream to do it. "
"326580","330080"," But I do at this point know what's going on and why my mic is muted."
"331760","336100"," So I'm gonna turn the stream off one more time but I do want to tell you first of all"
"336100","336280"," this."
"336920","341580"," It's important that I get this information out to you guys today because we're gonna talk about, I"
"341580","343840"," want to talk to you guys on a larger time frame. "
"345740","354860"," I need to be talking with you guys about, I need you talking to you about why, let me say"
"354860","356620"," I'm gonna bring this to a larger time frame here."
"360900","365380"," Let's see I'm gonna bring this over here and kind of show you where we're headed."
"367180","369900"," So this original channel that we're in above here, right?"
"370020","373180"," We started to break down inside this wider channel here. "
"373680","375160"," I want you guys to see that, okay?"
"375280","379020"," We started to make lower highs within this larger channel here."
"381080","384140"," And you can see the rejection we had back here on the 17th, okay?"
"384140","391620"," Now today, my expectation today was that we would train up today tomorrow or today on a Monday"
"391620","393800"," possibly up to this 400 level."
"394720","398380"," But the other, we have some issues with front running in the market. "
"399720","405260"," That's really what I wanted to talk to you about this morning was when does that front running"
"405260","405460"," begin?"
"406480","410300"," Under normal circumstances you wouldn't see it until June."
"411300","417740"," There was talk on social media that you would see it in May 25th, let's say."
"418000","421980"," And then this past week there was talk that you would see it by Monday. "
"422900","425360"," And you can see that the drop is already happening."
"425700","429900"," You can see today that there's no waiting any longer, right?"
"429900","437340"," Then there's no wait right now for, under normal circumstances June, there's no wait anymore for"
"437340","440000"," the minutes on FOMC."
"440500","443340"," And there's no wait anymore even until Monday. "
"443980","445640"," And this is what's called front running."
"445920","451280"," What's happening is there are larger market players that are front running this market down."
"452160","456820"," Now you need to be aware of this front running that's taking place, right?"
"457760","462560"," And this is, I wanted to bring this is the live stream that I wanted to do today before this"
"462560","463200"," even happened. "
"463780","465460"," And of course we're not getting that, right?"
"465580","472320"," We're not getting that opportunity to even have that discussion as to why the market is going to"
"472320","472960"," fail, right?"
"473140","478400"," So before even the market opened this morning, this failure would happen at some point regardless"
"478400","480280"," of where it began."
"480280","486320"," If it began today, if it began on Monday, if it began on next week on minutes, it doesn't really"
"486320","486780"," matter."
"487580","489300"," The fact is that it's going to fail. "
"490860","495000"," But within that failure too, there's some positive things to know about this failure."
"496240","498220"," Now within this failure, right?"
"499280","501800"," Whether it's up here, whether it's here, it doesn't matter."
"502140","504040"," But there are some very low price targets. "
"504040","510300"," I want you to realize that we are very well hedged down to 360 at this point."
"510360","512200"," I want you to see what my cursor is down here."
"512980","514020"," 360, okay?"
"514360","521480"," But this puts us into just the 27th of May, which is fucking soon, right?"
"521740","524700"," This puts us down here regardless if we trade it even up to 400. "
"525400","530240"," It still puts us to 360 before we even get into late June."
"531060","534740"," But where we lined up in late June is even deeper."
"535520","536180"," This is 320. "
"536640","538140"," This is June 20th."
"538420","539980"," This could be June 20th."
"540040","541600"," It could be June 23rd. "
"542280","548420"," And if we start to front run this and we start to get below certain levels, there's another dynamic"
"548420","548900"," in here."
"549100","553760"," There's layers to this happening, this redemption phase that's going to happen in the market."
"554100","559560"," I'm going to stop this stream and show it to you in the background, how it's taking place. "
"559560","568840"," One of the scariest parts about this is when you start to break through levels like 380, 360, it"
"568840","574240"," can be get faster selling, a ramp in selling."
"574480","578760"," So even if you have charts up like this, you start to actually break these charts."
"579680","583820"," And you have not just capitulation, but you have a liquidity problem. "
"583820","589540"," And I want to talk to you about that liquidity problem today and show you what I'm talking about."
"589980","597880"," And this is where liquidity providers, these are like very wealthy individuals out there with"
"597880","603220"," billions of dollars that large banks ask to provide liquidity."
"603860","608980"," Like can you loan us, basically can you give us money so that we can run day-to-day operations"
"608980","611060"," inside of our markets?"
"611860","616020"," If we start to break down the markets, they'll stop providing that liquidity. "
"616900","621520"," And I had someone comment this morning yell or yesterday, well that's been going on, you know, you"
"621520","622440"," have money on the sidelines."
"623300","625920"," Money on the sidelines is different money."
"626140","627980"," I'm talking about gray and dark money. "
"628860","635760"," This isn't money like I'm going to deploy this money, excuse me, I'm going to deploy this money"
"635760","641040"," into this market so that I can gain after three months."
"641040","642400"," Or a year or whatever."
"642840","645540"," This is money that's borrowed, basically. "
"645620","646940"," It's like me loaning you money."
"647720","650960"," In RRP is a good example of that, the RRP program."
"651460","657300"," Where I'm loaning you money or you're loaning me money overnight, very short periods of time so"
"657300","658200"," that the market functions. "
"659620","667400"," And that this is when you get large market crashes, when the money in the background begins to stop"
"667400","667800"," flowing."
"669040","674900"," If this gets front run, even though we're within this channel, they even get down to 320 into late"
"674900","680060"," June, you could see this take place or get rapped actually."
"680620","685320"," You could see you'll start to see not just banks doing, you'll start to see everyone begin to"
"685320","686500"," capitulate at some point. "
"687200","694760"," Now right now we're down below, we just tagged 381 87, we should tag 380, somewhere between here,"
"694860","695740"," 382 and 380."
"696580","703040"," But I want you to realize that when we're down here right now, what's taking place is they're"
"703040","704060"," cutting the legs off."
"704500","706840"," It's multi, it's layered. "
"707400","711560"," Right now what they're doing is beginning as I had posted about, they're going to start to cut legs"
"711560","715420"," off of the last tickers that are holding up the market."
"715420","719740"," You're going to see tickers like Tesla get whacked, you're going to see tickers like Apple get"
"719740","720160"," whacked."
"721120","728320"," And all these big boys that are supporting the indexes, the last indexes, or the last, they posted"
"728320","734480"," today about how you actually see real money selling individual tickers. "
"734820","739400"," But then you haven't really seen real money selling in the indexes because that will be actually"
"739400","740480"," the last to go."
"740480","744160"," You'll see the indexes, real money selling take place in the indexes."
"744880","752420"," You'll also see tickers not take part in the rest of the capitulation phase of this market crash. "
"753080","758760"," You'll see Facebook's go down a little bit but not quite like you'll see a Tesla or an Apple go"
"758760","759700"," down at this point."
"760360","761640"," So be aware of that as well."
"762940","767720"," On top of all this, you have to also understand there's some other complications here. "
"768120","774820"," They may want to get this done quickly so that they can actually close the quarter green believe it"
"774820","775080"," or not."
"775240","782620"," You could end up seeing capitulation move down to 360 to 320 and believe it or not see us whiplash"
"782620","785820"," back higher to close the quarter green."
"786300","788960"," So there's all kinds of complications down the road in this. "
"789660","791980"," We may not even close the quarter green."
"792180","798720"," You could see us capitulate down, let's say, to 320 into end of June, right?"
"799260","802320"," A huge capitulation move down, let's say, to 320."
"804320","810440"," We close the quarter, so Q1 we close it, 451, 64, we're adjusted. "
"811320","817780"," If we close Q2 below that number, you start adding weeks to months to quarters."
"818640","823700"," When you start to want to come back from that, it can take anywhere from two, three, four quarters"
"823700","827520"," to even regain that destruction that took place."
"828400","836400"," That puts you out into January, July of next year to even recover. "
"837040","838380"," That kind of a move down."
"838600","840360"," So let's say we even crash down there."
"840700","844320"," You're not going to right away be able to buy that bottom and say, hey, we're going up from here. "
"845160","846460"," It could take a year."
"846620","852700"," It could take a year and a half of up, down, up, down to finally even begin to pull back"
"852700","853660"," out of where we are."
"855060","857020"," Now, there are some other things we're going to talk about. "
"857080","858100"," I'm going to tell you all this right now."
"858180","861040"," I'm going to do a different live stream later."
"862340","870300"," But some other things to keep in mind is that I want you as a bull to understand that if"
"870300","874960"," you're a bull and you're like, I want to pay this price, let's say, for Tesla right now. "
"875380","876600"," I want to pay 700 bucks."
"877540","882060"," Well, a fucking bank, for where we are in the market, a fucking bank doesn't want to pay 700"
"882060","882720"," dollars."
"883220","884320"," They're not going to pay. "
"884320","890460"," And once they're committed to this market bloodletting, they're going to want to get the cheapest"
"890460","891340"," fucking price."
"891700","892260"," And that's a fact."
"892460","896460"," I didn't realize that the banks are the ones that start these runs. "
"897100","899040"," They want all their money, all their profit."
"899340","904140"," And then they go back in to viable companies once they've let the blood out of them."
"905000","906300"," This is the whole process. "
"907400","910460"," I've got books in the background about this whole process."
"911320","913140"," Accumulation and distribution of stocks."
"914760","916380"," Individual takers, even great stocks. "
"916780","920280"," This happened in a time memorial in the stock market."
"920520","922280"," So what you're saying, y'all wanted it seven."
"922820","928120"," The reality is they really want it down at like 350, 360, possibly even lower. "
"928760","932740"," They get a rat's ass about whatever Elon Musk is going through."
"933180","937820"," If that news drops and you're saying that's the reason that the market's dropping right now or"
"937820","939320"," Tesla, it really isn't."
"939380","946960"," It's just one more excuse to continue selling down to where banks can take their profit and then"
"946960","948220"," reinvest in this market. "
"949080","951940"," So I'm going to be aware of that as time goes forward."
"952920","956940"," Another note though in this is that historically our crashes have been short-lived."
"957680","964420"," As the years have passed and decades have passed, these events have sped up, mostly due to the"
"964420","970840"," dissemination of information, the advent of the internet, the advent of even us retail traders,"
"971020","975400"," hedge funds, banks, knowing everything at the same time, right?"
"975660","979580"," Right down to Bloomberg terminals with their chat software, right?"
"980140","982120"," You got to understand that everyone's connected today. "
"982480","985820"," Every interest group is connected to some point today."
"986040","990800"," So if you're a bull, you would rather get this over with faster than later."
"990800","1000460"," Do you really want to be back in 2008 and have this market trade down over two years or a"
"1000460","1004480"," year and a half or three years and not have these capitulation moves?"
"1004960","1006660"," It's kind of absurd at this point. "
"1007100","1013580"," You don't want, in this day and age, there's no possible way that you're going to get capitulation"
"1013580","1015100"," that takes two, three years."
"1015100","1020620"," You might get a muted market for two, three years, but everything is sped up today."
"1021200","1025280"," So I want to be aware that when you start to see these crashes, when you start to see where"
"1025280","1033339"," the Fed put is, modern monetary policy being applied, you're going to see ramps in these events and"
"1033339","1037520"," then you're going to see even compression of a bear market that happens afterwards, right?"
"1037720","1042700"," So let's say we go down to 320, you could see mid-200s by a year and a half, and"
"1042700","1049880"," then the Fed put come in and you have now large crashes along with condensed bear market. "
"1050820","1053820"," So all those things could compound in the next year, year and a half."
"1054320","1058260"," You know, there's no saying, hey, we hit 320, we're going to have a kick-ass rally off that, but"
"1058260","1062840"," it doesn't mean that we can't even continue to trade down because of the destruction that's been"
"1062840","1063060"," done."
"1063420","1067160"," Because the money that's been pulled out of the market, the money that's been pulled out of retail"
"1067160","1074640"," traders, the money that's been pulled out of hedge funds, pension funds, 401Ks, they're just"
"1074640","1076520"," dragged out of the economy. "
"1077080","1081100"," When that stuff happens, right, people don't right away come out of that."
"1081620","1087220"," And they're also dealing with inflation concerns and they're dealing with taxation, right?"
"1087580","1092080"," They're dealing with higher rates when they're buying mortgages, they're dealing with higher"
"1092080","1092420"," demand."
"1092420","1096380"," So all those things compounded should reset the system. "
"1097380","1103000"," Just be aware that the, I guess the point that I wanted to make to you this morning was that"
"1103000","1105820"," all this is being front-run at this point."
"1106420","1112060"," And the timeframes are moving quicker, quicker than you expect."
"1113160","1118860"," And so there's that talking side of the market and around the market that, hey, it's June, and"
"1118860","1119840"," that's, oh, no, it's hit. "
"1119840","1122020"," It's the FMC minutes."
"1122420","1124880"," And it's, oh, no, you know what it is, it's probably Monday."
"1125680","1131100"," And you can actually see where the market is trading right now at this moment that this is even"
"1131100","1132520"," being front-run faster. "
"1134040","1135200"," So there's a way to be aware of that."
"1135300","1137900"," It's like the key point of what I want to talk to you about this morning."
"1138220","1141080"," But of course, right after fucking Bell, we're selling off. "
"1141780","1144280"," I hope you guys took profit on calls off the Bell."
"1145020","1148680"," I did, but it's fucked up because I'm trying to get a livestream going."
"1148680","1152160"," I'm like, I'm like, they're fucking, they're fucking front-run in this shit. "
"1152900","1154680"," Already in a Friday, they're front-running it."
"1155120","1159660"," I do want you to also be aware that oftentimes we get breaks in the market in low liquidity"
"1159660","1160320"," environments."
"1160820","1166400"," As we head into the weekend, it would not be a shocker ever to see the market crash on a"
"1166400","1169360"," Friday, Saturday, Sunday into a Monday. "
"1170440","1171080"," It's low liquidity."
"1171260","1173160"," It's an easy way to drop to dump the market."
"1173920","1176860"," So I want to leave you with that before I stop streaming as well. "
"1177360","1179380"," I'm going to hammer it in a shorter view more."
"1179620","1180180"," There we go."
"1180840","1183480"," Make sure to get everything I want to get out to you guys today. "
"1184420","1187560"," I think that's basically all I want to let you know."
"1188720","1195460"," I'm going to reset my audio and try to get my audio fixed on this streaming software."
"1196080","1199480"," When I get the audio streaming done, I'll get back on and do a livestream. "
"1200240","1204420"," If it's not the next five or ten minutes, I'll get with you guys on Saturday."
"1205200","1210420"," I'll do a livestream because I know it's important for the market participants."
"1211100","1216400"," If you're along this market to know where we're headed and why we're headed there. "
"1216920","1223520"," In Australia, I've got the actual technical, not technical, but I've got the actual numbers as to"
"1223520","1229140"," why you should expect this to happen sooner than you think."
"1229920","1236400"," To be honest with you, if you don't watch that livestream, I want you to be aware of something."
"1240140","1248020"," From previous crashes, we've got puts in the market pointing towards that happening. "
"1248760","1255280"," Whether it's three or four days before the 20th of June, whether it's the following week, it's"
"1255280","1257800"," almost the done deal that you're going to see."
"1258480","1260520"," At least 360 by June."
"1262400","1267460"," The only other problem there is if you start to get those breaks below there, when you start"
"1267460","1271600"," getting down to 360, you start to break the market. "
"1272220","1274160"," You could see even further capitulation."
"1274940","1282440"," You won't see 150 to 100 in the VIX unless you get breaks of where we're headed to as well."
"1283340","1293160"," Anyone that's long fall into the June 20th, they want to see that happen before we even get to June"
"1293160","1293740"," 20th. "
"1294200","1303040"," They want to see that break of 360, I would say, by June 1st, May 25th, June 1st, FOMC meeting"
"1303040","1303960"," minutes can come out."
"1303960","1311080"," If the Fed was smelled and even they had fart sideways with 75 basis points, it's just another"
"1311080","1312900"," trigger to start selling this down."
"1313840","1319660"," I want you to think about that because it's not like that's the reason for the trigger. "
"1320280","1326200"," It's that that's the reason for banks that are positioned to sell to where they want to be."
"1326720","1331800"," They're looking for that news to continue the cell phone."
"1333420","1338960"," It's not like it's the news that's breaking is the reason we're selling. "
"1339500","1344400"," It's what is used as an excuse to get us to where they want us to be."
"1345180","1350300"," Keep that in your mind as a bull, is that ultimately that is where a bank wants us to be."
"1350660","1355000"," Ultimately, a bank wants to buy Tesla at 360. "
"1355940","1357320"," They don't want to fucking buy it at 500."
"1357900","1359500"," They want to fucking buy it at 360."
"1360240","1364840"," The only thing, the only like fly in the ointment on this happening, the only thing that I could"
"1364840","1371060"," see would be unknown market news, headline news like Ukraine. "
"1371860","1374960"," Because the banks can't control that, a ceasefire."
"1375940","1381020"," They can't control weed exports reopening back up or gas exports."
"1381020","1386620"," I know that's crass to say, but that greed will kick in for that kind of stuff. "
"1387160","1390000"," And then the other issue is would be the Fed, right?"
"1390560","1392180"," The only other fly in the ointment would be the Fed."
"1392300","1396180"," If the Fed comes in and says, well, we don't want this happening like that."
"1396820","1403440"," Other than those two things, the banks are looking for reasons to sell the market. "
"1404440","1405800"," And those reasons are here."
"1406180","1408880"," They're going to make those reasons up if they don't get them."
"1408880","1412780"," They're going to look to sell this market down and crash this market. "
"1413080","1416500"," That's the intent to get it down there."
"1416680","1418980"," They do care, it takes three years."
"1419440","1420460"," They want it down there now. "
"1421300","1422380"," The sooner, the better."
"1423300","1424520"," So I'm going to leave you with that right now."
"1424580","1425860"," I'm going to stop the stream. "
"1427000","1428500"," Appreciate you guys showing up at this point."
"1429040","1435480"," I hope the God that nobody is fucking long in stocks in this market without put-back spreads, ratio"
"1435480","1437220"," spreads, any kind of protection."
"1437220","1439360"," Just one side of the long in this market. "
"1439840","1444120"," Or you're doing zero dates, that's one thing, one date, some stuff like that's all fine."
"1444760","1448660"," But none of you out there at any point should be in just long this market."
"1449860","1452280"," It shouldn't have been since November. "
"1453220","1457760"," As a matter of fact, I have videos going back September and November saying, do not fucking long"
"1457760","1459160"," this market without protection."
"1459600","1463620"," And if anything, sell all your fucking longs now and ride this market down."
"1463620","1465160"," It took till January 4th to happen. "
"1465900","1468140"," And as you can see right now, I'll check out 38154."
"1469080","1473900"," We've broken down below any kind of semblance, right?"
"1474360","1477180"," That would mean that if we reject here, you can see this."
"1477460","1479600"," I want you guys to see this right now, right?"
"1480260","1482040"," I want you to see these lower bottoms here. "
"1484060","1487560"," I want you to see this goes all the way back to January 21st here, right?"
"1488140","1489980"," This is February 23rd."
"1489980","1494900"," And you can see that we're testing right now on a Friday, right?"
"1495020","1503680"," We're testing the same lower low down here going all the way back to January 24th."
"1503820","1506120"," So we're heading into a weekend right now. "
"1506460","1509940"," If we head into a weekend, we're able to trade down and break below."
"1510620","1516620"," If we're able to break below here over a weekend, what does that mean, right?"
"1516980","1517340"," That's the question."
"1517340","1518140"," What does that mean?"
"1518820","1519740"," And you can do it simply. "
"1520300","1526120"," It's very simple to show that if you break this down, you're looking for a rejection at some point"
"1526120","1527660"," to get even lower."
"1528240","1530740"," Forget 360, you're looking to start breaking levels."
"1531320","1536720"," I've got some other charts from the CME that I want to show you where. "
"1537160","1544520"," We have levels at 375, 360, but I'll tell you what, the only large node that we have from here"
"1544520","1546620"," down to 3,000 is at 3,200."
"1546620","1551300"," It's the only, only large node left in this market."
"1552680","1555880"," We have like speed bumps. "
"1557060","1560120"," And the grander scheme of things down to 3,200."
"1562820","1564520"," So just pay attention to this."
"1564960","1565500"," What are you guys?"
"1565860","1567620"," It's 191 of your paying attention right now. "
"1567660","1568480"," I can't believe that shit."
"1569180","1569700"," Crazy town."
"1570120","1574840"," If you're just tuning in right now, my microphone is down, so it sounds like a tin can right now"
"1574840","1575380"," when I'm talking. "
"1576540","1579460"," So I do want you to be aware of that as we go forward."
"1580060","1586420"," If you are just tuning in right now, I want you to also be aware, I want you to also"
"1586420","1587440"," be aware here."
"1587600","1589360"," I'm going to show you the levels down below here. "
"1590100","1591360"," We'll scroll through them real quick."
"1591660","1596800"," If it's a nice level here at 380, this goes all the way down to 380 right here."
"1596920","1598460"," There's not much down below here. "
"1599020","1601380"," Even this level here at 375 isn't much."
"1602920","1604420"," It's not that much."
"1604420","1605640"," We've got 360. "
"1606400","1610000"," We start getting some volatility down here."
"1610540","1614400"," We don't have shit until we get down to like 365, 362."
"1614720","1616780"," You can see on the right hand side here right. "
"1617380","1620500"," The first big note is somewhere down here around 360."
"1621300","1623920"," But the reality is it's down here at 320."
"1626380","1627920"," That's where the stink bids are. "
"1628200","1629360"," Way down here."
"1631430","1631990"," 322."
"1633430","1634750"," Way down below 322. "
"1636170","1637830"," That's some serious shit down here."
"1637990","1640630"," Why are you guys to realize how serious that is?"
"1640770","1644550"," That 322 is some real serious stuff."
"1644610","1645470"," You see that down here?"
"1646010","1649950"," We already know that 350 will be just like 400 to get some work to get through. "
"1651110","1653230"," But we breach this 350 right?"
"1654210","1658830"," We get down here by 23rd."
"1658830","1659490"," It's going to be huge."
"1660010","1661370"," This will be the capitulation. "
"1661430","1664370"," This is not even the capitulation move down to 350."
"1666250","1668030"," We want you to see right where we are."
"1668170","1669630"," The strength we have here at 380. "
"1671150","1673210"," You see that strength that we have there at 380?"
"1677830","1679110"," I did buy long here."
"1679230","1684290"," I want you to know that I'm long at 380, 250, and 380 itself up by long position."
"1686620","1687900"," See what you guys are doing right here. "
"1695480","1696460"," Risky is short though."
"1696700","1697500"," Thanks for the last you missed."
"1697500","1699040"," I just thought of you guys out there. "
"1700900","1710770"," I want you guys to realize this is not a conversation like I"
"1710770","1714270"," think this is going to happen or I think that's going to happen."
"1715110","1715810"," This is facts."
"1716370","1718250"," These are known levels in the market. "
"1718430","1721170"," These are known by banks and hedge funds."
"1722110","1725030"," Nothing like I think this or I think that."
"1725030","1731350"," I want you guys out there to realize that I've got a shit that I have to reload back up"
"1731350","1732250"," for you guys to look at. "
"1732830","1741510"," When I rebooted this stream I wanted to show you guys these numbers from the CME and FINRA from the"
"1741510","1744910"," CME and from some actual market participants."
"1745890","1748510"," I'm just sending this information to you guys out there."
"1748990","1752970"," I want you guys to realize this isn't like I think this is going to happen. "
"1752970","1760130"," There's timing issues with some of it happening but other than that these are internals in the"
"1760130","1761950"," market that are dictating these moves."
"1762870","1766390"," The only thing that you can't do is pick the time when it happens."
"1767810","1768370"," You don't know. "
"1768770","1776210"," My initial thought was that we'd have some Brett or we'd at least get through today I thought at"
"1776210","1782510"," least through Friday but my plan was by Monday was to sell the entire market by Monday no less."
"1783710","1788510"," Earlier last week it was the 25th and then about three or four weeks ago I was right around the"
"1788510","1790390"," 1st of June targeting 360."
"1791970","1797570"," But down here at 380 you're going to get a reaction here at 380 but I'm telling you what as"
"1797570","1798690"," we head into this weekend right?"
"1799630","1805510"," You will often see market crashes on weekends. "
"1806330","1807030"," It's very common."
"1807030","1809690"," Low liquidity environments, easy to dump it."
"1809770","1815990"," You break it down underneath 380 and then you make it a point of looking for some rejection over"
"1815990","1825110"," the next two weeks from 380 that will bring us down into June 1st at 360 and then you start"
"1825110","1826790"," looking for some huge pitulation. "
"1826850","1832870"," You're going to start looking for redemptions and you're going to start looking for people trying"
"1832870","1835790"," to pull a plug on investments in this market."
"1835790","1841070"," You're going to start to see liquidity drops, dark pools, great pools, that kind of stuff and you"
"1841070","1841250"," will."
"1841490","1842090"," It's going to get ugly. "
"1842610","1844130"," I promise you down here it's going to get ugly."
"1844910","1851310"," Maybe not today but I promise if on Monday morning if we wake up below 380 it's going to get"
"1851310","1852010"," fucking messy."
"1853690","1855370"," Real fucking messy, real bad. "
"1855890","1858110"," Don't think that there's going to be a fed put either."
"1858930","1860430"," There's no fed put down at 320."
"1860950","1862150"," There's no fed put down at 360. "
"1862750","1867250"," You've got a nice bounce down there if we trade down there but there still won't be a fed put."
"1867430","1875230"," You can trade 320 and then trade it back up to 4000 between end of the year or something and"
"1875230","1880050"," then we'll have another huge capitulation move down over the course of a year and a half."
"1880170","1886390"," You'll start to see us trade down into the 200s, into the next year and a half or so. "
"1887290","1894460"," So let me see how long it's going to be."
"1897620","1898600"," How am I long it?"
"1898700","1902800"," I've got zero dates on 385c expiring today."
"1905790","1907650"," I've got zero dates for today that I picked up. "
"1914140","1915800"," Is it time to buy TLT?"
"1916080","1917340"," No, be careful."
"1917920","1919040"," Antman's not going to be a great question."
"1919300","1920620"," So I'll answer some of you guys' questions right now. "
"1921040","1930200"," So TLT, there's an argument out there right now that you buy TLT, they're doing money coming back"
"1930200","1931420"," into bonds right now."
"1932760","1938040"," I'm not a proponent of TLT right now or buying bonds right now."
"1938520","1942580"," Until you get that capitulation move down to 360, 320. "
"1943980","1946400"," I think that's when you roll into bonds."
"1946740","1949200"," I think it's hand in hand as a matter of fact."
"1949700","1952140"," I'm not a proponent right now. "
"1952980","1954440"," There's that risk right now."
"1954440","1956620"," I wanted to talk about Dixie."
"1956940","1964420"," I wanted to talk to you guys about bonds, the bond market, and what it's showing is that TLT, you"
"1964420","1965940"," should go long TLT right now. "
"1966440","1968820"," I'm still not on board on TLT."
"1970480","1971500"," Hold on a second here."
"1971820","1973260"," Look at my stuff. "
"1975160","1976160"," I'm still not long."
"1976200","1977400"," I'm still not long in bonds."
"1978500","1980540"," There's an argument to go long in bonds right now. "
"1981340","1982880"," There's an argument to short."
"1983560","1987500"," The Dixie and there's another argument to long China stocks right now."
"1987580","1988480"," I'm still not a believer. "
"1989140","1991660"," I think it's a fakeout on TLT and bonds right now."
"1991740","1996460"," I think the bottoming process is a better place to take TLT long."
"2000260","2002440"," Was there a news that triggered the solve?"
"2003360","2004560"," Yeah, I talked about news. "
"2004880","2012040"," I talked about five minutes ago about the relationship between news and the real selling that's"
"2012040","2012840"," going on the market."
"2012840","2016940"," The news is being used right now to sell the market."
"2017120","2018740"," The news is pointless right now. "
"2019100","2023860"," You're just looking for those news events, knowing that they're going to sell this market at"
"2023860","2026040"," certain points, the first chance that they get."
"2027740","2029240"," Yeah, I just saw you guys out there."
"2030100","2033100"," Yeah, stay away from the TLT's up today. "
"2034480","2039620"," It's not that you won't see TLT go up right now or bought."
"2039620","2044760"," There will be a bottoming process and bonds right now, but I'll fucking tell you what."
"2046720","2047820"," I'll fucking tell you what. "
"2050620","2057179"," It's going to take, I would say, between here and June would be, maybe I guess you could buy the"
"2057179","2059480"," dips on TLT between here and June."
"2060440","2065420"," But your time horizon on TLT probably needs to be much farther out."
"2066960","2067780"," I'll find a guess. "
"2072060","2072500"," Awesome."
"2072620","2074840"," Definitely agree about STEM Tilti."
"2075179","2078719"," Captius C steep drop short term with a dip and rip lower highs. "
"2079699","2083580"," Lower lows was the highest we could rip to three or three to five expiry day."
"2083719","2086000"," You see a slight bounce coming today."
"2086900","2091600"," Yeah, so if you guys can see on the screen right here, let me bring this out lower here, okay?"
"2093380","2094800"," This is a level right here, right?"
"2094940","2095480"," We're at a 380. "
"2097280","2100700"," The next major level down here from 380."
"2102680","2107100"," You've got volatility all the way down, but it's not until 350, then 360."
"2108140","2111420"," I want you to see the significance of this level here at 380. "
"2112400","2113960"," So how do you break through 380?"
"2114940","2116800"," I want you guys to see this one more time."
"2116940","2118340"," I want to show you guys something one more time."
"2121730","2123690"," I want you guys to understand the significance. "
"2124230","2125310"," See this point back here?"
"2125890","2126610"," Follow my cursor right?"
"2126770","2127410"," That's January 24th."
"2127410","2130750"," I want you to see it back over here again, right?"
"2131050","2132270"," February 24th."
"2132670","2136650"," We are right here right now again at May 20th, okay?"
"2137590","2140910"," The market is at some point is going to capitulate. "
"2141050","2143430"," So when you make these moves like this, right?"
"2144430","2146650"," When you're making these moves like this, right?"
"2149060","2155120"," The bears have to, or not the bears, the bags have to break through."
"2156100","2157540"," Watch my cursor right here."
"2157640","2158600"," See this big line I'm doing?"
"2159040","2159640"," This is horrible. "
"2160040","2161180"," I can't believe I'm doing this right now."
"2161760","2162300"," It's horrible."
"2162500","2163240"," I can't believe I'm doing this. "
"2164300","2165980"," So you see that right there, right?"
"2166440","2168180"," These banks need to get underneath."
"2169920","2171020"," They need to."
"2171180","2171580"," It's required. "
"2172120","2173240"," So how do they get underneath?"
"2174840","2175220"," Right?"
"2175560","2180120"," You need to have a little liquidity environment we're running into on this weekend."
"2181800","2186100"," You need to have some events coming up, right?"
"2186340","2191960"," You need to have the market positioned for it, which in the background it is positioned for it."
"2192340","2196340"," They're positioned for 360 in mid-June down here, right?"
"2196500","2197780"," So they want to watch my thing. "
"2197920","2201900"," They want to get underneath, get a rejection, and sell this market."
"2202860","2204740"," So how do you get a capitulation move?"
"2205280","2209820"," You're going to be looking for on Monday a move down below 380."
"2209820","2215680"," If you can't get the move down below 380, then you're going to get us trading higher and then stay"
"2215680","2219300"," down into that 360 move into late June. "
"2220680","2221720"," God, this is terrible."
"2221960","2223980"," I've got to do this with a different stream."
"2224560","2230860"," I just slapped this stream together to get on live with you guys to explain this better to you. "
"2235190","2236910"," So yes, do I expect a bounce here?"
"2237010","2241530"," Yes, I expect a bounce between 380 and 380 today."
"2241530","2247570"," Without a doubt, if they can pin it into the close today, they will make an attempt to get below"
"2247570","2253770"," 380 come Monday so that they can turn it into a resistance point, not a support point."
"2254370","2259570"," That is to front-run lower lows. "
"2259830","2263030"," They want to get down below 360 into June."
"2263790","2267730"," The only way they do that is if they can get below 380 over the weekend."
"2277970","2279830"," I think when he was here earlier, maybe. "
"2280910","2282290"," Yes, I missed all you guys out there."
"2282370","2283190"," Just want you guys to know that."
"2288900","2292360"," I want you guys to know that I missed you guys out there. "
"2293660","2297780"," Okay, so what I'm going to do, so my streams are priceless."
"2298400","2299140"," So this is what we're going to do."
"2299380","2302300"," I'm going to try to fix my audio. "
"2303040","2307620"," I'm going to do a live stream tomorrow at 10 a.m. and I'll do it at 12 o'clock"
"2307620","2315400"," because some of you guys on the west coast, I'll do a 12 p.m. eastern standard time stream, so"
"2315400","2317620"," it'll be like 10 a.m. and I'll bring up all this."
"2317880","2323840"," I'll bring you all the background information to why I'm telling you this stuff so that you guys"
"2323840","2325080"," have at least tangible."
"2325500","2334020"," I want you guys to have tangible technicals for why this market is doing what it's doing, where"
"2334020","2336080"," it's going, why it's going, where it's going. "
"2336700","2339300"," Other than timing it, it's happening."
"2339660","2340700"," It's not going up."
"2340900","2342240"," It's built to fail. "
"2342760","2344980"," The entire thing is built to fail right now."
"2345720","2346660"," I went over this briefly."
"2347240","2355560"," I topically went over this this morning on some posts before market open and I went over it now"
"2355560","2358300"," verbally with you on a grander scheme. "
"2359260","2363500"," But tomorrow I had it up and then I had to reboot my entire fucking system."
"2365540","2374180"," I'll do a stream with you tomorrow so that you guys will get the nails and tags, the market"
"2374180","2374920"," internals, right?"
"2375340","2380320"," What's underneath the hood forcing this to happen and why it's bound to happen?"
"2380800","2388640"," There's only things out of the control of the banks that would make it not happen, which we"
"2388640","2390560"," discussed again about 15 minutes ago."
"2394720","2395980"," Yeah, my hair's not cut. "
"2396300","2397280"," You guys want to see the flow?"
"2398880","2400960"," You guys want to see the flow, bro?"
"2402080","2403320"," You guys want to see the flow?"
"2405180","2406340"," You guys want to see the flow?"
"2410190","2413230"," Guys, I apologize for the no audio today."
"2413670","2423150"," I had to bypass my mics and go straight to my camera, my Sony."
"2427670","2429250"," There's the flow, baby. "
"2430350","2431230"," There's the flow."
"2431770","2432850"," The flow going."
"2433730","2435030"," You guys want to see the flow?"
"2440400","2441400"," It's like crazy. "
"2446590","2450930"," Yeah, so I'll put my stream up at 12 o'clock Eastern Standard Time."
"2451830","2455790"," So West Coast people can watch it, 10 a.m. people on the ER."
"2455790","2459650"," Excuse me, 10 a.m. people at 10 o'clock in the morning can watch it on the West Coast. "
"2460150","2461630"," People on the East Coast can watch it."
"2461950","2463970"," Is it 9 a.m. maybe?"
"2465370","2466970"," You're going to get the flow going?"
"2467590","2468550"," You guys are fucking hilarious."
"2471090","2475690"," We're going to talk about the VIX, too, because you guys have to understand the VIX is not going to"
"2475690","2479070"," fucking 100 unless you break through specific levels. "
"2479350","2481370"," You guys have to have unexpected moves."
"2482290","2483670"," You guys need to understand that."
"2484370","2485050"," Yeah, man. "
"2485230","2489130"," You guys all know about hockey here?"
"2491430","2492830"," You guys know about hockey here?"
"2494710","2496110"," Yeah, I love all you guys out there."
"2496190","2497030"," We're all you guys know that."
"2497350","2499450"," They don't respond to you guys all the time. "
"2499530","2501250"," It's just because I don't have the chance to."
"2501610","2504210"," But I want you guys all to know that I read all of your texts out there."
"2504430","2506730"," DMs, your posts, all that kind of shit. "
"2507770","2509750"," No, stop fucking buying stocks."
"2510370","2512630"," Seriously, you guys are killing me."
"2512630","2513350"," Hold on. "
"2513390","2516690"," I'm going to put this up right now so you guys can see where you are."
"2518840","2520220"," Well, you guys can see this, right?"
"2520800","2522640"," Here's your level right here, 380-10."
"2523100","2527420"," You want to see a bounce off this 380 down below here. "
"2528340","2531600"," And you want to see a rejection in forests that trade up into the bell."
"2532780","2535680"," There are going to be some levels you're looking out for above."
"2536200","2539140"," You can see previous levels of back here. "
"2539140","2548000"," You can see at 380-250, 384-31, a big one here at 384-94."
"2548740","2552240"," If we bounce off 380, I expect to see us trade to 385."
"2552920","2558180"," I'm going to doubt that we reclaim 380-7, 380-9 is possible. "
"2558880","2559640"," Anything is possible."
"2560800","2565920"," But my assumption here is rather going to trade sideways on 380 into the bell."
"2565920","2568240"," Or we're going to get a hard rejection here coming up. "
"2569980","2573920"," Hard rejection 380, where we trade straight into the bell."
"2574120","2575060"," They try to pin it."
"2575680","2578440"," One problem with the pin it would be that they hold puts. "
"2579180","2581360"," They let them expire worthless in the bell."
"2581560","2588120"," The intent would be to, if I'm a large bank, what I would do, if I had a short position,"
"2588420","2590800"," you guys want to know how this is done, I'll tell you guys how it's done."
"2591680","2597260"," If I put like 500 million dollars on a large short on the market, right?"
"2598480","2601160"," I can then go into single tickers. "
"2601540","2603340"," Let's say like a Tesla and Apple."
"2605180","2607020"," I can short them, right?"
"2607320","2609420"," And I can short them on smaller indexes."
"2610440","2612220"," That doesn't, that don't have a lot of liquidity. "
"2612880","2615280"," It's like a Tesla's a part of a smaller index fund."
"2615920","2617800"," I can go in there and actually short it."
"2617800","2622080"," Short the, short the holdings from smaller indexes. "
"2624120","2629440"," And then I can start shorting the big indexes as well by not by with the short but by buying"
"2629440","2629680"," puts."
"2630340","2635500"," So let's say I get put, let's say I buy like fucking 20 million, or that wouldn't be that much."
"2635740","2639320"," Like one, a million to five million, let's say in spy puts. "
"2640320","2644780"," I would burn those pie puts down for the money that I take shorting elsewhere."
"2645240","2646740"," That makes any sense to you out there."
"2647220","2651760"," So what they would do is leave those puts on into, into an update day on Friday. "
"2652440","2654300"," They would pin the market into end of day."
"2654880","2659380"," So a 380, you'll either see a reaction, you'll see shorts be closed."
"2659840","2664740"," If you don't see those shorts closed, you'll see them hold them and you'll see puts be held into"
"2664740","2665040"," the bell. "
"2665500","2668060"," So we either, we have the trade sideways in the bell 380."
"2668900","2671700"," Oh, we see a large reaction, large, large move higher."
"2671920","2674240"," That's if these banks close for profit here. "
"2676420","2680400"," So we'll keep an eye on this 380 price target."
"2680620","2682000"," We're going to see if we get a reaction."
"2682240","2684260"," I'll stay with you about 380, 61. "
"2684700","2688480"," So I'll stick around with you here until we hit this, this number down below and see if we get"
"2688480","2689080"," a reaction here."
"2690580","2692780"," Now I'm going to grab some more calls down here as well."
"2756240","2757900"," We're already getting a reaction right now. "
"2757940","2760340"," We'll see how good, how big this reaction is."
"2761060","2765000"," You might want to wait to grab some calls yourself for a retest down below."
"2765000","2768500"," You might get a retest at 380 one more time. "
"2769000","2771500"," Then you might see a V-shaped recovery here."
"2780710","2783410"," I'm adding a 385 C's."
"2784290","2786590"," Let me see what I, they're going to have 44 cents. "
"2791460","2796080"," Yeah, about 385 C's for 44 cents."
"2798650","2799990"," I bought them twice now."
"2800070","2805730"," I don't know, my average, tasty works kind of sucks looking for like a dollar cost averaging of"
"2805730","2806630"," what you bought them for. "
"2807370","2817040"," Let me see"
"2817040","2818120"," here."
"2822440","2824140"," So first target's going to be 385."
"2826240","2827620"," Possibly you get the 390. "
"2828340","2833660"," Depends on what the recovery is like, but it would not shock me to see us trade up to 385"
"2833660","2835640"," and then trade down into the belt."
"2836180","2838880"," They really want to pin this shit into the belt they can."
"2839080","2843020"," The intent behind where we are right now, if you're listening to me up, if you're still paying"
"2843020","2844160"," attention to it. "
"2844160","2851700"," The intent right now of today is not to get it to 380 and then let it come back in"
"2851700","2853240"," V-shaped recovery."
"2853660","2859360"," The intent today is going to definitely be to attempt to pin this market into the belt so they can"
"2859360","2861680"," drop below 380 into Monday."
"2862100","2863200"," That would be the implication. "
"2863540","2865580"," If I was a bank, that's what I would want."
"2866020","2871160"," You don't come down here to 380 for no reason, you want to come back down here and try to"
"2871160","2872940"," get this market to close under 380."
"2874700","2877520"," But I am along this market right now, just if you guys want to know. "
"2883300","2889250"," Yeah, all right, let's talk about, I don't know if we can talk about that right now."
"2889350","2889970"," We'll talk about it tomorrow."
"2890350","2893870"," We have to talk about a few things. "
"2894470","2895330"," I'm not prepared."
"2895630","2899810"," I thought I was prepared this morning to talk to you guys about some else, but it's tough for me"
"2899810","2901210"," to do live streams for you guys."
"2904030","2907430"," From PayPal, I'll explain it all to you another time. "
"2907630","2909110"," It's not important right now."
"2914370","2917270"," Oh yes, soul of success, thank you for supporting the channel."
"2917710","2920210"," If you like these streams, please like and subscribe. "
"2921110","2924390"," We're going to try to get these things going once again."
"2924930","2929330"," We may be forced into some form of a pay model."
"2930210","2934890"," If I do a pay model, I'm not going to do it for profit, it's just going to be the"
"2934890","2935610"," pay for the stream. "
"2937270","2940750"," You need to be aware of that if you're tuning in right now."
"2940750","2941690"," It kind of sucks."
"2942750","2943890"," It's fucked up as that. "
"2944270","2948070"," I'm being forced into it by payment processors and social media."
"2948850","2949910"," It's kind of fucked up."
"2958600","2959920"," This is the first target right here. "
"2959980","2961320"," If you look to the left, $3,255."
"2963100","2965320"," More resistance here at $3,350."
"2967100","2968740"," Be careful of this above though. "
"2968880","2970180"," See this $3,85 here?"
"2971200","2972400"," I want you to pay attention to this rate."
"2972540","2974140"," You can start to see them popping in right now."
"2974140","2975180"," Start to see. "
"2975420","2976700"," I want you to see this $3,350."
"2977660","2979920"," And this $3,550 here."
"2981120","2982080"," $3,86. "
"2982300","2982960"," This V-Wup."
"2983420","2986460"," They're going to want to swoop back down and take charge."
"2987260","2988740"," The last target would be $3,88. "
"2989480","2990800"," Flat and then $3,89."
"2991880","2993960"," So you can mark those on your own chart here."
"3010860","3011900"," I got a little bit of bounce there. "
"3012000","3014260"," I'm almost stuck like 50% of those calls."
"3016740","3017600"," You guys want a toast?"
"3019980","3021440"," Brad, thanks for sending me a DM."
"3024090","3025570"," You know what it is, Christian?"
"3026150","3026950"," That's a good question. "
"3027290","3028190"," So just on that topic."
"3028850","3029670"," So here's the deal."
"3033720","3038600"," If I were to do, so it's what I'm doing. "
"3039460","3043380"," If I was to do, let's say I did a daily brief that was typed."
"3046060","3048480"," I used to do a daily brief that was typed."
"3048660","3049640"," I didn't charge anything for that. "
"3050180","3051500"," There's like no need to."
"3053700","3061500"," When I did videos, like pre-recorded videos, there isn't a really, it was a little bit more time"
"3061500","3061900"," consuming."
"3062240","3067220"," So if I'm doing my own due diligence every day, I spend like two hours a day on due diligence. "
"3068640","3072780"," Adding like a daily brief was like 45 minutes."
"3073300","3074120"," Didn't cost me anything."
"3074340","3079020"," And then I could, and then when I added videos into it, it was like another two to three, about"
"3079020","3079920"," two hours on average. "
"3080600","3084580"," Unless it was a big video, where I needed to do a lot of work on it, it'd be like,"
"3084740","3086860"," so I'd add like two hours."
"3087060","3089140"," So I was like four, five hours a day."
"3090220","3091380"," And these are pre-recorded. "
"3091820","3093240"," I can record them when I have time."
"3094440","3095840"," And I'm able to trade."
"3096920","3099380"," The problem here, the issue for me here is this. "
"3099760","3101340"," I'll tell you guys what it is if you guys want to know."
"3101340","3110480"," So the issue here is that, because I'm in the space of live streaming and not doing a written daily"
"3110480","3118600"," brief or like a log, or because I'm not doing just pre-recorded videos, and this includes"
"3118600","3125840"," classes, because I'm live streaming with you all day, right?"
"3126760","3128560"," It is time intensive."
"3128560","3131800"," It's minimum eight hours plus my own two hours. "
"3131800","3132960"," That's ten hours a day."
"3133940","3141760"," On top of that, I have to pay for services for you guys to have access to as well, right?"
"3142260","3143340"," To add value to this."
"3144880","3149300"," And that I need as well, and I use that I need, that costs me money. "
"3149460","3154800"," It costs, and then of course I'm doing high, I'm not recording a video and uploading it."
"3154800","3159940"," I have to pay for the best internet that I can have so that I can get you guys a"
"3159940","3161260"," live stream that's fast."
"3163020","3166180"," And then because it's live streaming, my equipment costs are very high as well. "
"3166840","3171680"," I've got very high equipment costs, and then they're ongoing through time."
"3172560","3178940"," The other aspect to this though, some of the benefits of this is that I can get you guys like"
"3178940","3181380"," trade the news so you can keep me on the background, trade the news."
"3181380","3186120"," I can get it, if it's some kind of a pay model, I can get it so that you only"
"3186120","3190820"," have people that pay for it, get the live options flow, you're listening to trade the news, that"
"3190820","3193040"," you're getting the hero indicator in real time. "
"3194700","3197240"," But the other thing is that the time coming is huge."
"3198360","3201720"," So, at the end of the year, it's like, it's bank."
"3202040","3202860"," It costs me a lot of money. "
"3203300","3204380"," That doesn't even include the time."
"3205260","3212500"," But then the other problem though is this, is it was working fine, and then both, I shouldn't say"
"3212500","3212700"," this."
"3213060","3214760"," Both were losing their shirt in the market. "
"3215500","3216780"," They tend to tip well."
"3218440","3221600"," As bulls are losing money, they don't tip for the live stream."
"3221940","3225920"," So then the costs that are associated with it are starting to cost me money. "
"3226420","3231440"," The other thing that I looked at my P&Ls from when I started live streaming, because of the time"
"3231440","3239880"," command, and I had to adjust my trading style to fit the live stream, because I'm not focused only"
"3239880","3240700"," on my trading."
"3241340","3246740"," So you're talking about a stream that doesn't pay for itself, you're talking about my own P&Ls"
"3248020","3256080"," hurting from live streaming, save the cost, the damage to my own P&Ls, and"
"3256080","3263880"," then I got hit by PayPal, believe it or not, PayPal shut my tips down."
"3263880","3270740"," And this is where the killer is, is that I had to go and talk to a couple of guys"
"3270740","3277100"," that have this happen to them, I reached out to some YouTubers over this, and there's the deal, is"
"3277100","3283720"," payment processors don't want, first off, payment processors have commitments with social media"
"3283720","3284160"," platforms. "
"3285660","3289100"," And, and payment processors want to sell two different things."
"3289680","3295040"," They're going to sell a package of tips to social media platforms."
"3295960","3298360"," So they want to steer you into that, into that service. "
"3299880","3304040"," If, if I bypass that, they can shut me down at any time."
"3306000","3309420"," The other thing they don't like is that I'm not selling you something that's tangible."
"3310020","3314240"," So like, let's say you tip me because you had a good day, I gave you a good call, and"
"3314240","3314940"," you had a great day. "
"3315220","3320080"," So, you tip me and I don't tell you what it was for, you don't tell me what it was"
"3320080","3321140"," for, you just leave a tip."
"3321140","3322420"," They don't like seeing that."
"3322520","3324900"," They want me to, they want me to sell you something. "
"3326340","3333560"," So, so the, so this is where the grip is, is under the tip program, I might get like 50 "
"3333560","3339500","% when it's all said and done after taxes and they're cut, and they hold for anywhere from three"
"3339500","3341280"," months to a year and a half that money."
"3342140","3348400"," In that timeframe, if they want to shut me off at any time, they can, or hold, or hold and"
"3348400","3351900"," not even give me the chance to refund you your money."
"3352100","3353120"," So, there's like all these problems. "
"3353940","3360100"," And so, it's geared towards, it's geared towards, if I had like a Twitter page and I was tipped"
"3360100","3365240"," five bucks, you know, once a month or something, it's no big deal."
"3365400","3370120"," But if I'm doing this whole production in the background, they almost force and push you into a"
"3370120","3372680"," paid model, which really fucking sucks."
"3373700","3377960"," If I was doing like a video and being a big deal, but with this kind of production that needs"
"3377960","3382640"," to go into this, it just all, you know, it all adds up in compounds into a pay model. "
"3383160","3392100"," Now, with all that said, I'm also being asked in the background to turn it into a pay model where"
"3392100","3396360"," I make money off this, right, which I don't want."
"3396960","3398400"," I don't want to make this a career."
"3398800","3404060"," I don't want to make this where I stop trading and I'm making fucking influence or money or any of"
"3404060","3405460"," that kind of fucking nonsense either. "
"3405460","3407420"," I have no interest in that."
"3408980","3413580"," So, I don't know if it's a matter of like every month or two, I show you what's coming in"
"3413580","3418180"," and what my costs are, and adjusting by subscribers."
"3418800","3421140"," I don't know how to do this yet, we're trying to work on this. "
"3421820","3423240"," I don't know if there's different tiers."
"3423700","3427460"," I know there are people out there that are like, Hey Cap, I'll pay you 500 bucks a month."
"3427720","3432440"," I know there are people out there that are like, Hey Cap, 10 bucks sounds great, 30 bucks sounds"
"3432440","3432760"," great. "
"3433260","3435680"," I know I got people out there that are like, I can't afford anything."
"3436540","3440580"," Or just based on principle, I only do a free model."
"3440820","3442520"," I get all that, 100%. "
"3443280","3445060"," So, I don't know how to please everybody."
"3446560","3450880"," My first, my knee jerk reaction is to just shut the entire thing down."
"3452520","3454000"," Because it's not what I do. "
"3454180","3460480"," I'm not here to make a career out of, because I don't like those fucking people."
"3460480","3465900"," I got a real fucking problem with a lot of people that are selling like classes."
"3466400","3467120"," That's the other thing. "
"3467240","3471740"," The reason why I do this live streaming is because if I sold you a class for like 400 bucks"
"3471740","3476240"," or 700 bucks or something, some fucking stupid, that shit never works."
"3477300","3480200"," There's plenty of free classes that will give you that information."
"3480980","3484400"," What really works is when you're there trading with someone day in, day out. "
"3484400","3494080"," Like, you really can't pay for trading with somebody with more time in market and you"
"3494080","3496800"," learning on the side in with that person."
"3497480","3499720"," Over time you do become a better trader normally."
"3500360","3502380"," There's a stark difference. "
"3503240","3504820"," And this is the other thing."
"3505240","3509400"," My other problem is that I paid 500 to 1,000,000."
"3509400","3513700"," Me and most are paid with 600 bucks for a guy at a live stream private. "
"3514640","3517060"," And the fucking guy was there twice a week."
"3517160","3519600"," And he wasn't even there at peak peak pivots."
"3520160","3524360"," So there's this whole aspect to this where I have to build value. "
"3524880","3526980"," I have to make it seem like it's something that it's not."
"3528140","3530000"," And then of course trap you in."
"3530460","3533140"," And then of course I'm looking for new trainers. "
"3533920","3535340"," They blow up their accounts quickly."
"3535340","3539980"," And then I have to advertise and attract new fucking traders again."
"3540440","3543680"," And you start to lose great traders in that mix. "
"3544360","3549960"," And it's really fucked up because there's a model that I could use that I'd make a lot of money"
"3549960","3550410"," off of."
"3551540","3558300"," It's such a bizarre model because it's so fucked up because it doesn't help anybody."
"3558580","3559380"," It doesn't help new traders. "
"3559680","3560720"," It doesn't help old traders."
"3561820","3564060"," None of it on the back end works."
"3564060","3568080"," But you as the consumer are going to pay for it. "
"3568340","3569620"," It's so fucked up."
"3570000","3573980"," The human psyche is one of the most fucked up things in this world."
"3574960","3576680"," If I try to give you something for free. "
"3577400","3581060"," If I try to give you something for free that has no value."
"3582260","3589520"," The whole system around this is built to charge."
"3590200","3594000"," Which it did fucking sucks all the way all the way around. "
"3599440","3600840"," So it's me in the middle."
"3601220","3601420"," Yeah."
"3602160","3604400"," We're going to do a live stream tomorrow. "
"3604620","3606500"," What I try to do is find a way to."
"3607440","3611360"," If I do this committed I think I'm going to have to do a tier program."
"3612200","3616720"," I think it's something where you get a live stream that's free in the morning. "
"3616720","3618540"," Like 8.30 to 9.30 or something."
"3619620","3624880"," Or free from like 8.30 to 10.30. At least for the open."
"3625360","3629260"," But then I turn that into a paid service. "
"3630660","3631700"," Don't hold me to this."
"3632680","3634040"," And that paid service."
"3635020","3639980"," There'll be one more tier above it where I'd be willing to mentor people for. "
"3640920","3642820"," They're looking for more one on one stuff."
"3643680","3646500"," Where you get like you get one on one once a week."
"3647940","3650860"," For a couple of hours I'd call you up on the phone or something like that. "
"3652200","3655360"," And you might get special text messages from me."
"3655920","3661520"," Like today especially right here like 3.80. I could send you a text message right here and say you"
"3661520","3667380"," know I'm buying that 3.80. And when you get those alerts you can pretty much guarantee they're"
"3667380","3668540"," going to print every fucking time."
"3673130","3674530"," But it's only friends. "
"3674950","3676530"," Yeah the fucked up part."
"3677250","3681770"," What you guys understand the fucked up part of this is the structure of what we're doing."
"3682530","3687630"," It's not like the structure of what we're doing is not like making videos. "
"3688450","3691590"," Like if I were to record videos I can sell them to you."
"3691670","3693610"," If I record classes I can sell them to you."
"3694150","3695370"," It's such a fucked up system. "
"3696210","3698750"," It's a totally fucking fucked system."
"3701950","3703310"," It's there to fuck you."
"3705150","3707450"," But the best way to do this is with live streams. "
"3707630","3708810"," I promise you guys you'll get more."
"3710250","3717210"," You'll get more from a live stream paying a monthly fee than you would ever get from paying 500,000"
"3717210","3718670"," bucks for some fucking classes."
"3719550","3725650"," You'd figure in a year for 200 bucks you get more bang out of that buck over the course of"
"3725650","3730830"," a year than you ever would from buying some assholes pre-recorded fucking classes. "
"3738720","3743360"," Yeah there's a there's a there's a there's a team in part to it."
"3744660","3751660"," You know the live streams like I've watched so many other live streams out there and it's always"
"3751660","3757200"," like two guys fucking stroking each other off fucking sucking each other's dicks."
"3757680","3759220"," Fucking so stupid. "
"3762840","3764940"," But they're not focusing on trading."
"3765520","3767620"," They're like I'm not fucking here."
"3767820","3774660"," And then if they're telling you anything about the market it's always like vague. "
"3775060","3776460"," Just vague enough that you don't know."
"3777500","3780260"," I get enough of that all over fucking social media."
"3780800","3781580"," I don't need vague. "
"3782700","3785060"," I want to know when someone's going along and someone's going short."
"3785360","3786220"," I want to fucking know."
"3786680","3788640"," I want to know when someone's closing their position. "
"3788640","3793800"," I want to fucking know a day later or if it turned out well for them."
"3794280","3797080"," I want to know what you're doing when you're doing it."
"3797900","3799940"," Especially if you want to learn. "
"3800300","3801480"," Let's say let's say I closed."
"3801800","3805540"," Let's say down here at 380 I bought long here at 380 right?"
"3806400","3807380"," And it failed."
"3808000","3810400"," Wouldn't you want to know that like right as it's happening?"
"3811140","3811860"," Why did it fail?"
"3812800","3815060"," What could I have looked for for why it failed?"
"3816060","3819140"," That's the thing is like and that's how I think people are like well you don't want to give them"
"3819140","3819340"," everything. "
"3820440","3823140"," Yeah you want to teach them but let them figure it out on the road."
"3823360","3824060"," I'm like I agree with that."
"3824200","3828020"," But there's so many fucking people out there that do this like vague teaching. "
"3828860","3830560"," You guys want to see that in live?"
"3830920","3831220"," Like why?"
"3831880","3835640"," You guys want to see what 380-350 first resistance is?"
"3836160","3838620"," You guys want to know what 385 is for your next resistance?"
"3839620","3841360"," I mean we're doing this live right now."
"3841360","3845040"," It's important for you guys to have that experience."
"3845660","3847580"," I don't think many people offer it out there. "
"3847680","3848360"," I don't think it's offered."
"3849060","3851340"," I think people have like egos."
"3851480","3853260"," They can't get past their own egos. "
"3853460","3855860"," I think they make bad fucking trades."
"3856160","3857020"," I'll fucking be honest with you."
"3857080","3857940"," You have these fucking guys. "
"3858240","3862380"," They're out there making fucking all this money on fucking selling you guys subscriptions."
"3863120","3864440"," They're fucking hack ass traders."
"3864740","3865180"," That's what they are. "
"3866060","3867580"," There's no real money on the line."
"3871810","3872890"," Now we'll go through it."
"3872990","3875030"," So you guys ask me about the chance we don't crash. "
"3875210","3875750"," What will happen?"
"3876250","3878370"," You guys want to know if like where we're going from here."
"3878470","3881810"," We'll do a live stream tomorrow on Saturdays."
"3882110","3883030"," Show up on Saturday. "
"3883770","3884390"," It's important."
"3884730","3886250"," I don't know what the fuck you have planned for Saturday."
"3886250","3888810"," But for where this market is right now, right?"
"3889410","3890350"," I fucking tell you what. "
"3891750","3897750"," There's no reason for you not to fucking pass on your plans tomorrow."
"3898270","3902570"," And show up at fucking 10 a.m. because unless you fucking know all this shit."
"3903790","3906370"," If you do, don't fucking show up. "
"3906510","3907090"," I'll tell you what."
"3908010","3910250"," This market can move fucking fast."
"3911070","3912370"," This next month and a half. "
"3912590","3916270"," Between now and June, June 20, I'll call it the 23rd."
"3916830","3919850"," Between now and June 23rd, this market's going to fucking move."
"3920630","3922730"," And there ain't no two ways about it. "
"3922790","3928070"," I promise you right now, it's going to move like a mother fucker between now and late June."
"3928890","3930410"," I thought we had a day."
"3931030","3933850"," I thought we had a least until on a day today. "
"3935570","3938670"," That's why I was pumping that shout to you before the fucking open this morning."
"3939330","3942150"," Because I'm like, man, if they pull this bullshit out the bell."
"3942930","3946150"," I'm like, did I post some shit for you guys yesterday about Tesla?"
"3946990","3950690"," In the morning before the Tesla shit went crazy, right?"
"3951910","3953850"," You guys saw a post yesterday about Tesla, right?"
"3954370","3956210"," I posted that before it fucking happened. "
"3958810","3960590"," It's a note it's going to happen."
"3961190","3962590"," You know it's going to happen."
"3964350","3966810"," They're ramping it happening. "
"3967830","3970930"," You guys yesterday people are like, no fucking way that's happening with Tesla."
"3971570","3973210"," No fucking way it's happening with Apple."
"3974150","3976050"," And they'll come up with a reason for Apple as well. "
"3976290","3983570"," They're going to come up with a reason for all these companies to get whacked."
"3983570","3985430"," And that's just what it is."
"3986070","3986910"," Did I say fuck?"
"3987170","3988030"," Fuck yeah, I said fuck. "
"3992040","3995060"," Yeah, it's at 12 o'clock Eastern Standard Time."
"3996180","3998000"," I said 10 because of the West Coast."
"3998600","3999820"," People that puked from the West. "
"4002040","4006960"," So 10 o'clock or two it'll be 12 a.m. I'll make a post on Twitter."
"4007520","4012740"," If you don't follow me on at Captain's Alpha, just follow me today."
"4012920","4013840"," I'll make sure that you're in there. "
"4013840","4021720"," I'll post the livestream to add Captain's Alpha and my regular Captain James Twitter account"
"4021720","4022240"," tomorrow."
"4022520","4024960"," I'll make sure that my fucking shit's ready to go."
"4025240","4026080"," It was all ready to go. "
"4026260","4029700"," It was all ready when I was having technical problems today on stream."
"4030640","4032480"," I haven't been trading in my office."
"4032720","4035980"," I've been trading in a different fucking computer setup. "
"4036580","4038120"," So I had all my shit turned off."
"4038760","4040600"," I went today to turn it back all back on."
"4040600","4044880"," And I had a bunch of updates I had to do. "
"4045500","4050100"," And then one of my computers, I think I think one of my computers I tried to reboot it."
"4050780","4054100"," And with that rebooting I was probably in some updates."
"4056000","4062300"," And then I've got a resetting going on in my audio, in my background of my audio stuff. "
"4063120","4064800"," You guys can't see a bunch of shit."
"4065440","4068180"," I've got monitors spread around here."
"4068360","4069480"," I've got lights all set up. "
"4069480","4072700"," I've got different microphones set up and a whole bunch of wires."
"4073800","4076640"," Different computers and stuff like that so we can run these streams."
"4077480","4081300"," I'll take a picture for you guys so you guys can see what the setup actually is. "
"4081620","4083020"," Because you guys just see me here."
"4083480","4085020"," You guys are fat."
"4085280","4086560"," Some of you guys probably already know. "
"4087060","4093340"," Some of you guys that aren't in production would be fascinating to see what the room looks like"
"4093340","4093920"," behind me."
"4093920","4099220"," Because I've got a desk and another bunch of shit behind you guys can't see."
"4100500","4107500"," I was doing a behind the scenes one day and I was doing a film one day. "
"4108200","4109260"," What my day is."
"4109680","4112899"," I get up in the kids in the morning and get them ready to go."
"4113380","4118460"," Then I get myself ready to go and come down to this office and get them all my shit work"
"4118460","4118740"," done. "
"4119460","4122779"," What it takes to get the stream started up and running."
"4123660","4126140"," Then of course I'm talking to you guys on Twitter and shit."
"4131020","4136060"," 12 PM Eastern Standard Time. "
"4138670","4139189"," Tomorrow."
"4139970","4142390"," If you can't make it you can watch it later."
"4143750","4148609"," If I have the time I'll try to edit that video so I can cut out. "
"4148609","4150170"," I don't know if I can."
"4150330","4153170"," Sometimes you want to watch the questions in chat."
"4154470","4157410"," It's starting to break through 383.60 now. "
"4158149","4160470"," Next level above is 385."
"4164109","4165750"," See if I can push higher to 385."
"4166729","4169910"," If we break above here, wait to see this resistance here. "
"4170430","4171810"," Watch follow my cursor down below."
"4171990","4173470"," You'll see this resistance here at 385."
"4173470","4180370"," If we're able to break through and squeeze higher, target above would be 388. "
"4181390","4187330"," I'm going to give the 388 like a 40% chance of happening."
"4188609","4189250"," 385."
"4190609","4192410"," It would be a pretty decent recovery. "
"4193229","4196170"," It's possibly, we bounce off 385."
"4197150","4198390"," Try to make our way out."
"4198550","4200710"," Maybe we squeeze up to 388 into the belt. "
"4204010","4205730"," That's 155 in the afternoon."
"4210930","4212130"," Just leave it raw, Kat."
"4212590","4213030"," Yeah, I will. "
"4213210","4213910"," I think I will leave it raw."
"4214810","4217550"," Can't believe this 221 of you watching right now."
"4217930","4220410"," That's not even fucking counting the people that are in the..."
"4220410","4224030"," That's not even counting the people that are tuning in that I can't track. "
"4225070","4225510"," Awesome."
"4226450","4227290"," Am I swearing?"
"4227810","4228830"," Yeah, hell yeah, I'm swearing."
"4232450","4233950"," The way this market is. "
"4234910","4237070"," Good to see you Chase and Chaz."
"4237070","4237950"," Good to see you Josh."
"4238810","4239250"," Marcus. "
"4239570","4240010"," Brad."
"4240690","4242070"," Cheating good to see you."
"4243450","4244050"," Dougie Dee. "
"4244230","4244970"," Ben Godfrey."
"4245590","4246470"," Dan Breslin."
"4246770","4247210"," Moonbounder. "
"4247450","4247690"," Jay Money."
"4248470","4249570"," Well, this is out there."
"4249910","4250630"," Josh, my brother. "
"4251310","4252550"," I fucking love you."
"4253390","4254350"," Good to see you."
"4254670","4255610"," Dan Breslin's out there. "
"4255730","4256030"," Hell yeah."
"4256290","4257150"," Omar is out there."
"4257290","4257750"," Good to see you. "
"4257890","4258370"," Omar Christian."
"4258610","4259190"," Good to see you."
"4259950","4260390"," Jason. "
"4261130","4261830"," Well, this is out there."
"4263270","4264550"," Whole bunch of regulars."
"4266090","4267990"," Whole bunch of regulars out there. "
"4268690","4269470"," BD's out there."
"4269610","4270410"," Cody's out there."
"4270570","4271250"," Hotch is out there. "
"4271910","4272790"," Jan's out there."
"4274290","4275830"," Guys, I want to see my face tell."
"4275990","4277170"," My hair fisted is out there. "
"4277650","4278610"," Hell yes."
"4284050","4284590"," Yeah, Christian."
"4286030","4287290"," Yeah, Apple did hit demand. "
"4288090","4289490"," Jill, good to see you as well."
"4290890","4292530"," Good to see everybody that's out there watching."
"4292750","4294270"," I appreciate you guys watching right now. "
"4296820","4298420"," I'll put this back on for you guys."
"4298420","4298640"," Sorry."
"4298840","4300820"," My screens are all fucked up right now. "
"4301580","4303140"," I'm going to be looking for this right here."
"4305600","4306800"," Looking for this 385."
"4307440","4310280"," This is the previous slow from earlier in the week five days ago. "
"4312040","4316860"," I don't have my, you guys can't see it on this one down here."
"4320600","4321120"," This is the price."
"4321300","4324320"," I don't know why it's not shown on my charts right now, but the price target a pair of breaks. "
"4324760","4326320"," You guys had this this morning."
"4326920","4330600"," You guys should have had the price target at this price target breaks down below today."
"4332670","4336390"," But we're going to be looking for me looking for a tag here. "
"4337090","4340050"," Maybe a rejection and a squeeze higher in the bell here."
"4340970","4343410"," That would be, that would be, that was what I think would happen."
"4344810","4349330"," If we could break right through, if we start breaking through here and go straight up in the bell,"
"4349630","4350450"," that's possible as well. "
"4351230","4352350"," But more likely scenario."
"4352710","4356410"," The most likely scenario, we do a slow drag down."
"4356790","4358410"," That's scenario one right there. "
"4359510","4360710"," This one right here."
"4363310","4367290"," That's scenario two and that's in terms of probability."
"4368110","4370070"," That's my probability score right there. "
"4370690","4373630"," Bounce off 385, trade down into 380."
"4374170","4375950"," This is what the banks want to see in the close."
"4377150","4380410"," This would be a sneaky peak where you close out right at the last minute. "
"4381290","4382850"," This is option number two."
"4383670","4390330"," We crawl back up into the bell and then of course option number three is going to be, you just"
"4390330","4392250"," kind of smash around here and go straight up."
"4393010","4396450"," Notice though, we're not getting that fast V-shaped recovery. "
"4397230","4400830"," We didn't get that huge buy off the bell down below here."
"4401530","4408410"," If this was bottom, typically you would see a relentless buying operation right?"
"4408830","4413510"," You'd see the buy program on by the banks and you're not seeing that."
"4413830","4415510"," You can see that this started. "
"4416730","4417610"," Hold on here."
"4419900","4421960"," You can see that at 130 right?"
"4422560","4428720"," It's now half an hour into half an hour into the market bouncing at 380."
"4429320","4435820"," So in this one half hour period, you would have already expected to have slapped off 385. "
"4436540","4437100"," Does that make sense?"
"4437260","4438420"," You'd have expected a buy program."
"4439080","4443920"," You'd have expected us to immediately on a V-shaped recovery to come up."
"4443920","4445020"," Reject. "
"4445820","4446400"," Right?"
"4446740","4447340"," Consolidate."
"4448720","4455160"," At this time, we should probably be breaking through to get up to that 389 let's say."
"4456260","4461520"," By not seeing that immediately, we should be right here right now. "
"4461800","4468360"," By not seeing that take place, it starts to do away with the V-shaped recovery in close."
"4469120","4471600"," That leaves you with one and two."
"4471600","4475040"," And the first one would be what do banks want, right?"
"4475440","4478420"," They want to slam here, right?"
"4478540","4482720"," They want to reject here and they want to burn everything into the bell, right?"
"4482860","4487860"," They want to keep their shorts on, keep their puts on, and they want to pin it here into this"
"4487860","4492420"," bell so we can hopefully get much, much lower open on Monday. "
"4493260","4494500"," That's the implication."
"4495300","4501240"," The second, the second most plausible would be that we trade down here, right?"
"4501880","4504600"," They work on getting that back that close down here again."
"4504600","4511720"," If it fails at least, if it fails and you've just got fires in the market, instead of closing or"
"4511720","4516920"," carrying it over the weekend, they cut it loose. "
"4518640","4519820"," It wouldn't go that high."
"4521040","4522600"," They would cut it loose here, right?"
"4523540","4526260"," And re-short again on Monday at this 390."
"4528900","4533700"," And there'd be no more put delta rolling off. "
"4535880","4537160"," So I'll see how this plays out."
"4540380","4541000"," Good to see everybody."
"4541200","4541920"," Cecilia, how are you doing?"
"4547430","4548170"," Good to see you, James. "
"4548910","4549530"," Good to see you too, Ken."
"4549790","4550430"," Good to see you, brother."
"4551270","4552310"," John Moggs is in there. "
"4552470","4553110"," Who else is out there?"
"4553810","4554570"," Hotch is out there."
"4554650","4555130"," Good to see you."
"4555230","4555790"," Good to see you, Mayor. "
"4556010","4556410"," How are you, brother?"
"4557750","4558390"," Mark Brown."
"4558390","4559890"," Make my days here too."
"4559890","4560510"," Where are we?"
"4560650","4561150"," Rome's here. "
"4562610","4563330"," James Wallace."
"4563630","4564070"," Tomos."
"4564350","4564630"," Binky. "
"4565070","4566030"," Good to see you, my brother."
"4568680","4569540"," Chaos Wilson."
"4570160","4570800"," I love it. "
"4571100","4572200"," I love it."
"4572400","4572640"," Chaos."
"4575110","4576550"," So you're not seeing this, right?"
"4576690","4578030"," You're looking for this moment, right?"
"4578190","4580210"," You're looking for, hey, are you getting that V-shape recovery?"
"4580870","4581590"," You're not seeing it?"
"4582050","4584050"," I want you to look back on book map right now, right?"
"4584650","4585070"," Liberty rejection. "
"4585750","4586290"," Not big rejection."
"4587570","4589450"," Next spot above is 385."
"4589450","4594330"," I am going to expect us to train up here to 385, to grind up here. "
"4595190","4598050"," And we're going to look on a small, on a larger time frame now."
"4598650","4600910"," To see what's going on, you can see them above, right?"
"4601790","4611030"," 385 V-WAP above at 386.29. If we do reclaim 385, next target above is 388."
"4620760","4621920"," Much love, brother. "
"4622620","4623240"," Same to you, James."
"4623920","4624680"," Good to see you, GP."
"4624900","4625600"," You haven't seen you in a while. "
"4626160","4626800"," Hey, James."
"4626980","4627640"," Good to see you, too."
"4627820","4628860"," Mars, Mars is out there. "
"4629520","4630720"," Marcus, what's going on?"
"4633160","4634140"," No, I just have to reload."
"4634720","4637800"," So I've got heroin, Decatur, on another computer that I'm using right now."
"4638260","4640460"," And I have to reload it on this one right now. "
"4640600","4642440"," I had to turn my computer off and back on again."
"4644840","4647420"," Let's just drive the market to zero and start all over again."
"4647820","4648980"," Yeah, I agree with you, Dylan. "
"4649620","4650560"," Get it down faster."
"4651120","4652000"," It's going to get front run."
"4652100","4654520"," We're getting it front run without a doubt. "
"4654520","4657520"," I thought the front running would start Monday."
"4658400","4660760"," As of yesterday, I said, uh, Monday."
"4661520","4666260"," Last week, I thought, uh, last week I was like, uh, I won't start until the 25th. "
"4666760","4669840"," And then last month, I was like, uh, might start in June."
"4670780","4673780"," Uh, but it's all getting in front run."
"4674060","4674520"," You got panic. "
"4674800","4678380"," There's panic at the top right now."
"4679980","4684500"," There's absolute panic."
"4686060","4687120"," LPs are panicking. "
"4687440","4687860"," There's panic."
"4688300","4689240"," I guarantee it."
"4690580","4691240"," I'm not panicked. "
"4691560","4692900"," They're going to get it front run this shit."
"4693000","4693660"," They're going to get ahead of it."
"4694380","4695980"," One way or another, that's what's happening. "
"4697760","4699360"," And where you thought it would happen?"
"4699740","4701680"," Where you thought you had some time, you just don't at this point."
"4704860","4706300"," Hey, you're a boomer, good to see you."
"4707980","4709420"," Uh, how's construction doing?"
"4710560","4711240"," It's going well. "
"4711860","4713860"," It's going as good as it can go."
"4714540","4715520"," I'll leave it at that."
"4718600","4720760"," I apologize for the audio at this point. "
"4721060","4725260"," I have had some issues today with, uh, rebooting everything."
"4729880","4731040"," Good to see you, uh, William."
"4731560","4731840"," How are you?"
"4732540","4733300"," Everybody's here today. "
"4733300","4734060"," I'm fucking stoked."
"4735820","4737080"," Kind of shocked right now."
"4737960","4739720"," Yeah, so PT above still 385. "
"4744440","4745180"," Let's give you a more."
"4745340","4746240"," Let's give you a better number."
"4748520","4749000"," 38469. "
"4753750","4754230"," 38469."
"4754230","4755570"," We'll see if we can get them better."
"4758940","4759340"," 38469. "
"4767250","4768510"," Move that one over, right?"
"4771710","4772110"," 3464."
"4773350","4774650"," So they're right here."
"4774930","4775630"," This is where they are. "
"4786600","4790260"," With 388Me, we don't believe below 380 on Monday."
"4790540","4794900"," Yeah, so we're gonna have a live stream on Saturday so that we can go over this with you guys."
"4795360","4797060"," I don't think you guys understand where we're going. "
"4797900","4801860"," I don't think, I think somebody don't understand that we are heading probably."
"4803500","4804660"," Well, we're heading to 360."
"4805100","4806440"," That's almost a 90% guarantee. "
"4807840","4812960"," Uh, but we're probably heading down to possibly as low as 320 now."
"4813380","4820620"," Like between, probably C360 by the end of the month and 320 by, by June 23rd."
"4830360","4830880"," Yeah, no. "
"4832380","4833900"," I'll explain all that tomorrow."
"4834000","4837580"," The, uh, demark buy on spy is a no go."
"4840700","4842740"," I'll explain to you why it's a no go. "
"4845040","4849980"," Why don't you guys understand out there if you've not been in a crash?"
"4850920","4853860"," If you have not been in a crash, right?"
"4856030","4864620"," The liquidity dries up from a liquidity provider perspective from dark and gray pools."
"4865420","4866780"," Guys have to understand that."
"4868820","4870260"," Guys don't understand that. "
"4870260","4879960"," Uh, 360 P or 320 P is, if 360"
"4879960","4882020"," then times the robot to reload puts."
"4884580","4885660"," That's the minute of June."
"4886020","4887080"," Yeah, we'll talk about puts tomorrow. "
"4890250","4891730"," Yeah, more than likely got to see."
"4893890","4897030"," Let me see, let me see if I can show you guys this in a better chart here."
"4902480","4903320"," Today I'll show you this. "
"4903520","4903900"," Give me a second."
"4917220","4919660"," See if I can show you guys what I'm talking about here."
"4940210","4941570"," We're going to make this real simple. "
"4942210","4943590"," We're going to simplify this."
"4945590","4946910"," So I just cleared off the chart."
"4947910","4948750"," It's not a yes. "
"4949290","4952890"," I'm going to make this like, uh, fucking high schooler kind of standing."
"4954390","4955830"," We're going to make this really simple."
"4959420","4959820"," Simplify. "
"4959980","4962080"," We're going to simplify this today for all of you out there, okay?"
"4965240","4967340"," That these beautiful moves down here, right?"
"4968500","4969920"," Anticipated bounces, right?"
"4971460","4972240"," Consolidation, right?"
"4973760","4975480"," I'm going to sell down below here, right?"
"4977720","4979580"," This is called an attempt, right?"
"4979580","4983140"," To break below this negative channel, right?"
"4983340","4985240"," This negative channel that's going down."
"4985680","4987120"," I want you to see this, right?"
"4987940","4988760"," This is an attempt."
"4989920","4991200"," This isn't bottoming. "
"4992900","4996620"," This is an attempt to break through this channel."
"4998100","5000900"," Long ball gang doesn't like this channel."
"5001120","5002200"," They don't want this channel. "
"5002840","5004140"," They want to break this channel."
"5004400","5005700"," So how do you do this, right?"
"5006420","5008420"," How do you get down below this channel?"
"5008640","5009260"," It becomes the question."
"5010400","5011840"," So how do you have these moments?"
"5012000","5015240"," If you have a market crash type scenario, this is all anticipated, right?"
"5015840","5017080"," You guys can see this, right?"
"5017260","5018280"," That this is all anticipated?"
"5020740","5027380"," Going back to January, you're going to, until we change trend, you're anticipating, until you break"
"5027380","5031080"," trend, that we're going to get here eventually, right?"
"5031240","5034180"," That's the implication, right?"
"5034540","5035280"," So this is all implied. "
"5035580","5036600"," This is an implied move."
"5036600","5037940"," We know we're coming here."
"5038640","5046280"," So if you're a long ball gang, you need to break the implied move. "
"5048340","5051800"," If you're a bull, you need to break out of this trend, right?"
"5052020","5060750"," So if you're a bull, if you're a bull,"
"5061210","5068230"," you really can't get bullish until, believe it or not, there."
"5069510","5071010"," That's when you can get really bullish."
"5071990","5074490"," That's when you can throw something on and you come back to it. "
"5074490","5079770"," You have to break this previous high over here, but you get the gist, right?"
"5080830","5082510"," There's like volatility."
"5084010","5086710"," Then there's another leg here and then somewhere over here."
"5086830","5088390"," This is when you get really bullish above here. "
"5090190","5092410"," But that's another story."
"5092670","5096010"," The key point is that when you break it, when you're down here, right?"
"5096450","5097990"," This is part of the implied move, right?"
"5099070","5103550"," It's implied that we're not going to trade out of here right now, right?"
"5103550","5106350"," That this is the highest we can go right now, right?"
"5106890","5108590"," And we're not going to break through here, right?"
"5108690","5109930"," Implied moves, right?"
"5110950","5112250"," Implied trading area."
"5112910","5120560"," Whenever we trade outside, this is something that's unexpected, right?"
"5122920","5127620"," So if you're going to, let's say you're bearish or you're a long ball gang or you're like uber "
"5127620","5132800","-super duper, I want a market crash guy or a woman or whatever, what do you do when we're at"
"5132800","5134560"," these points, right?"
"5134560","5141440"," When we're here, when we're here, when we're here and we're down here and we're right here, right?"
"5141760","5142500"," What do you do?"
"5143380","5144740"," Especially if you want to set it up. "
"5147970","5151350"," You know that by bleeding the market down here that you're at capitulation."
"5151970","5154410"," So there's high risk of capitulation down here."
"5154630","5155790"," Alright, boom. "
"5156090","5159430"," You've done number one, right?"
"5160330","5162350"," Worst time in the market to sell down here."
"5162890","5164510"," Worst time to capitulate."
"5164870","5166690"," Most fair there's ever been in the market. "
"5167290","5168650"," So how do you get below this?"
"5168870","5169710"," Below this trade zone."
"5169830","5171350"," There's only a couple of ways, right?"
"5172330","5174570"," There's only a couple of ways to get down here."
"5175630","5179010"," If we don't capitulate here, what's the next move?"
"5179230","5180010"," You're asking me, right?"
"5180190","5180550"," We bullshit. "
"5180890","5181270"," Fuck no."
"5181890","5184590"," Next move's to trade down here over time."
"5185250","5185830"," Here's June. "
"5186530","5190350"," It's trade down at 360 and just in the end of June right there, right?"
"5191570","5192450"," Still bearish."
"5192990","5194810"," Still no reason to get bullish here."
"5196850","5199410"," We get traded all the way up here and then trade down. "
"5199970","5200830"," 3,400."
"5201550","5202270"," That's not bullish."
"5203090","5204530"," Nothing about that that's bullish. "
"5205350","5205990"," Does that make sense?"
"5206970","5213450"," So if you're a bear out there, if you're a long ball gang, you can't go buying fucking calls in"
"5213450","5216330"," the VIX to 100 when this is part of the implied move."
"5216910","5220730"," So if you're a big bank and you want to see a crash or you want to see some money"
"5220730","5225910"," off that long ball gang, if you want to make some money and some way far outside the money puts,"
"5225990","5232570"," while we're down here where we are right now, what do you have to do?"
"5233730","5234770"," You have to set it up."
"5235070","5239210"," The setup is, first of all, you did the..."
"5239210","5240410"," First of all, we touched right?"
"5240950","5241350"," We sold. "
"5241630","5244650"," This is an operation to sell the market down one more time, right?"
"5245590","5251850"," They're then going to come in right here at 3,854."
"5253490","5254790"," It's on ES by the way."
"5254790","5257930"," And they want at least some kind of rejection. "
"5258550","5261530"," They want to get a rejection there and above."
"5263130","5264190"," Let's call it here."
"5265630","5272910"," 39.53. What they want is they want to see, first of all, into the weekend with a low equity"
"5272910","5274750"," environment, they want to dump it even deeper. "
"5275570","5277150"," They want to dump this down below."
"5278250","5282690"," So the first break of this negative channel opens the door down below."
"5282690","5285290"," When you hear people say, right, we open the door down below. "
"5286050","5287510"," So you've now checked off."
"5287690","5289090"," We broke the negative channel."
"5290370","5294050"," The second thing that they're looking for at this point, they don't care if it comes back up. "
"5294530","5297750"," They're looking for this now to be turned into resistance here."
"5298230","5299050"," You see that?"
"5301440","5303700"," And we've already got 360s down here."
"5303900","5307340"," In the market, you've got huge hedges down below. "
"5307780","5311820"," And I didn't even check to see what hedges came out today, and I'm sure that they're more at 3 "
"5311820","5313180",",600."
"5314920","5315720"," This is June."
"5315860","5316920"," This is June, by the way. "
"5317780","5318320"," Right down."
"5318420","5318800"," Here we go."
"5319680","5321280"," So the setup's already in place. "
"5321480","5322380"," You see how the setup is there?"
"5322500","5323240"," You know how big resistance?"
"5323880","5325740"," You've now broken this negative channel."
"5326380","5327480"," You now have hedging."
"5327820","5330580"," This is wag-the-dog stuff by large banks, right?"
"5332120","5334420"," You've got some bullshit news used. "
"5334640","5337420"," You've got minutes coming out, right?"
"5338080","5346780"," So if you can break this down over the weekend, you've set the market up to reject here, right, to"
"5346780","5347260"," head lower."
"5348200","5355320"," And with all of the top of all that, you've got some smaller players that have been in the market"
"5355320","5359220"," long since this 3,600 or so, somewhere down in here."
"5360140","5365060"," So if we start to break down here, you've got that quick capitulation moment, right?"
"5365060","5372660"," Where you're forced, where you've got a board, a board group of people that say, hey boss, in our"
"5372660","5378340"," contract, it says if we go all the way back to 3,600, that we cut our long-only fund,"
"5378700","5378700"," right?"
"5378840","5380480"," We cut our long-only positions here. "
"5382420","5383540"," Banks, large banks."
"5383900","5387140"," Do you actually think large banks want to buy this right here?"
"5387460","5387920"," Fuck no."
"5388680","5392420"," If we're down here, we've taken it from January to go all the way down here. "
"5392940","5394620"," And you think they want to buy this?"
"5394940","5395340"," Never."
"5395860","5397660"," They want to buy this down here."
"5397980","5399560"," And they want you in full panic mode. "
"5401500","5403520"," They want you saying, oh fuck, we're fucked."
"5404480","5405840"," And then they're going to buy this."
"5407740","5409420"," They're going to stop this, right?"
"5410080","5414480"," And then you're going to wind up buying it up here and selling it again once again, right?"
"5414780","5418220"," And then they're going to buy it again and bring it up higher for recovery. "
"5421400","5424800"," And everything is set for this to happen right now."
"5426100","5427440"," The setting is here."
"5428380","5429620"," The table's been set. "
"5429980","5431140"," The table cloth's out there."
"5431660","5433100"," Plates, the forks, the knives."
"5433820","5434660"," There's cooks in the kitchen. "
"5435640","5440440"," Everything is set up for this to take place coming into June."
"5441340","5442480"," There's not a lot of time here."
"5443160","5444040"," I want you to see that. "
"5444280","5451820"," So, with the table being set here, call it June 23rd."
"5452760","5455400"," With the table being set here, there's not a lot of room."
"5455400","5456040"," Do you see that?"
"5456440","5458680"," It's getting tighter and tighter and tighter. "
"5459280","5463600"," Now, how do we break this, stop this from happening?"
"5466340","5468160"," There's only two ways."
"5470420","5472980"," And that is something that's no control of these banks."
"5473260","5473780"," One would be Ukraine. "
"5474620","5476060"," And the second is Jerome Powell."
"5476300","5477140"," They have no control over him."
"5479560","5488700"," The other scary option is we don't trade higher than 4,500 way up here before June. "
"5489660","5493940"," Remember that I told you that the Q1 close is 45164."
"5494880","5495260"," That's 5."
"5495800","5496960"," That's not the ES numbers."
"5497900","5499820"," But if we don't close above here, right?"
"5501060","5502720"," That means we have two bad quarters. "
"5503640","5508120"," When you start adding up bad weeks, bad months, bad quarters, you don't recover."
"5509400","5511880"," So, which poison are you looking for as a bull?"
"5512500","5513860"," Are you looking for the poison of..."
"5514300","5515740"," Are you looking for this poison?"
"5516300","5517460"," Is that the poison that you want?"
"5517460","5522920"," I would think that if you're a real market participant, you don't want this."
"5524180","5527540"," You want to fuck around with me day trading for the next fucking year and a half?"
"5527880","5528700"," Probably not. "
"5531220","5535480"," If you're a real bull, you probably want something like this."
"5536700","5540900"," So that you can buy a defined bottom and not worry about it as much."
"5543380","5547980"," If you're over bullish and you're like, well, I really want to have..."
"5549860","5551100"," I really want..."
"5551100","5553140"," I really want to see..."
"5553140","5554100"," Let me see. "
"5554220","5554840"," Move this somewhere."
"5556400","5557340"," This thing doesn't want to go."
"5560460","5562420"," Say you're an over bull and you're like, oh, yeah, Cap. "
"5563100","5564200"," I want to see this huge bounce."
"5565220","5566060"," We're going way higher."
"5567320","5567600"," Uh-oh. "
"5570110","5571230"," Like, hey, Cap, this is the end of it."
"5571310","5572130"," We're going way higher, Cap."
"5574160","5575800"," That's the end of the correction, Cap. "
"5576500","5584560"," Um, I'll tell you what, I've never seen a correction like this over fucking four months, right, or"
"5584560","5585120"," five months?"
"5585760","5585840"," Never."
"5586520","5587320"," Like that."
"5589600","5596100"," Where a bank's going to tell you, in advance, with some channel like this, that this is what they"
"5596100","5603620"," want, is not going to be a kumba fucking yah moment where you and JPM fucking buy right here, and"
"5603620","5605120"," you have two fucking hold hands. "
"5605620","5611680"," You and Jamie fucking diamond are going to fucking stroke each other as we fucking go on and up to"
"5611680","5612800"," fucking 5,000."
"5612880","5613600"," That's shame happening."
"5614140","5615920"," Well, I'll tell you that's not going to happen, okay?"
"5616300","5616640"," Ever. "
"5618080","5618580"," No."
"5619940","5621120"," You're fucking dreaming."
"5622080","5623560"," It sucks to say that. "
"5624580","5626120"," Does that make sense, too, if you're a bull?"
"5626660","5634380"," If you want to trade this as a bull into Monday, my recommendation to you, or if you like, can't"
"5634380","5638720"," want to take a long call spread air, something like that, I'm going to tell you that there's high"
"5638720","5647560"," risk, high risk, between now and after I'm seeing minutes, it doesn't matter if we trade, if we"
"5647560","5654940"," don't, it doesn't matter if it doesn't get below, between now and just June, June 23rd, I would"
"5654940","5658480"," say, no matter what happens in here, this is coming down."
"5658900","5659480"," Promise you."
"5660360","5661120"," Promise you. "
"5661340","5661940"," Promise you."
"5662020","5663700"," It's coming out 3,600 ends up."
"5664160","5667140"," Fair, fair, fat fucking chance that it's coming down to 3,200. "
"5671240","5673280"," Does that make sense to any of you guys out there?"
"5680020","5687520"," Yeah, I mean, when I showed you guys, what I showed you guys was, it's not like we can't trade"
"5687520","5689780"," up from here, it's a 3,900 to 3,950."
"5691840","5697880"," We can trade out of our normal trading range over one to five days, there can be a squeeze higher"
"5697880","5704100"," to 3,950, but from this point forward, you're more than likely, if you're like, hey, if you're"
"5704100","5709800"," like, hey, cap, I want to take a put position down here or a short position down here, I would"
"5709800","5715680"," say, don't put a lot of money on it, but maybe at the bell, I would say like 4,15,"
"5716220","5722580"," I might take like a put spread or a short at 4,15, but I wouldn't put a lot of"
"5722580","5729560"," money on it, but I'd make it very small, like 3%, 5% of your portfolio on and off chance"
"5729560","5736100"," that it happens, it's successful, and then I'd be looking for your, if you're like, I don't want to"
"5736100","5742020"," take that risk on as a bear, then I would say to you, you're going to be looking for 3 "
"5742020","5751760",",950 on the high to reshort the markets, but that's your next placeholder, between now and sometime"
"5751760","5761580"," next week, maybe Monday, maybe on a day on Monday, you could take that trade, I'm"
"5761580","5772000"," fucking telling you guys, this is the last fucking morning, the last one, yeah,"
"5772240","5778480"," you're not going to get UVX, you're telling me what, UVXY and print and shit, and say, if you don't"
"5778480","5784160"," break this trend over here, I'm going to tell you what, tell you what, you see this line right"
"5784160","5792560"," here, see this fucking line right here, that fuck, if you don't break this or UVXY, you get a small"
"5792560","5797900"," print off it, but you ain't getting that fucking, you ain't getting like fucking gold digger shit,"
"5798360","5804940"," unless you break this, you have to break this, this is an implied move in here, believe it or not,"
"5805180","5813280"," this is even, even believe it or not, 440 is implied, there are literal market makers that actually"
"5813280","5820720"," ascribe the chance of this happening, once you start breaking out of here, right, it's not"
"5820720","5826240"," expected, these aren't, we're not expected to trade below here, so if we were going to trade below"
"5826240","5832040"," here, it's more likely going to happen Monday, if we don't, if it doesn't happen on Monday, then"
"5832040","5841780"," you're more than likely not going to see it happen until maybe the minutes or maybe end of"
"5841780","5851780"," month, but the problem with that too, again, is, dude, this is the problem, like the moment that"
"5851780","5858660"," we get hedged to 320, if it's not, if it's not something that's unexpected, and let's say we just"
"5858660","5865640"," trade down to 360, and then we get puts for 320, or 340, and then 320, and 320, and 320,"

"6415060","6424540"," perspective okay, so back in the 1990s, like mid 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union,"
"6424900","6432160"," and the state owned everything, they owned like, you fucking name it right, they owned like the"
"6432160","6440280"," beef producer, they owned AT&T, they owned everything, anything you can think of, bus companies,"
"6441600","6448200"," railways, they owned car manufacturing, they owned oil production, gas production, food production,"
"6448800","6456880"," didn't matter, they owned oil, and they handed out these certificates believe it or not to each"
"6456880","6465000"," Soviet citizen, and there was a black market that was started where Soviet citizens were selling"
"6465000","6470720"," them to, so you became an owner of all these companies as a Soviet citizen, well the black market"
"6470720","6476240"," started and Soviet citizens started to sell these certificates, it's a true story, and they were"
"6476240","6481300"," selling them to each other, and of course they started to consolidate these certificates, and these"
"6481300","6488120"," certificates found their way into the mafia, the Russian mafia, so eventually they sold the Russian"
"6488120","6493760"," mafia, so they would have like, this is true, they had like a fucking room with like 30,000"
"6493760","6499700"," certificates owning one of these companies, and so let's see a gas problem, this is true story, a"
"6499700","6507920"," gas problem, let's say it was worth like, I don't know, billion fucking dollars, this is an example"
"6507920","6516120"," here, well you only needed like 150, let's say 100 million dollars of these certificates to"
"6516120","6525900"," actually buy gas problem from the state, so US New York bankers"
"6525900","6535600"," came into Russia and they bought these certificates from these Russian mafiosos, and"
"6535600","6543560"," US investment banks were able to own like 49% of these things, meanwhile these mafiosos became"
"6543560","6548940"," oligarchs, they owned the other half of the company, they went down to the state, the state handed"
"6548940","6558620"," over all the rights to these companies, and when this happened, these mafiosos started to fleece"
"6558620","6568600"," these companies, so you had ups and downs and US investment bankers, you had, within the stock"
"6568600","6575660"," market in Russia, you had like booms and bust cycles, you even had cycles where you had investment"
"6575660","6581340"," makers go back and say well they're stealing, but they're not stealing this much, so the real price"
"6581340","6588360"," in the stock market of gas problem is wrong, you have to raise it up, boom another boom cycle, and"
"6588360","6598000"," there's been so much corruption in Russia to this point that after the withdrawal of investment"
"6598000","6605700"," in Russia, these oligarchs now hold these companies, these companies are now worthless, and then"
"6605700","6613540"," with the start of the Ukraine war, these companies have become even more worthless, right, so how"
"6613540","6620340"," do you reset all of this by war, so if you reset these companies by war, right, let's say you"
"6620340","6628460"," have a war here, which you have in Ukraine, the moment there's the truth called, in Ukraine, there"
"6628460","6636440"," are going to be investment banks, American investment banks that want to buy back into these"
"6636440","6643080"," markets, I know that's a shocker for some of you out there, but they're going to want to buy these"
"6643080","6648420"," companies at rock bottom, there was even talk that some of the big banks were doing this in the"
"6648420","6655220"," Euro market and they were doing in the US markets as they were shutting down trading, you could"
"6655220","6662200"," trade I think gas problems specifically RSX or the Russian ETF, you could buy it for pennies,"
"6662500","6667780"," people were buying it for pennies before trading stopped on it, so now you've got some US banks in"
"6667780","6674280"," control at rock bottom prices, so you're going to see this cycle once again take place blue rock,"
"6674500","6683720"," or at least an attempt once again to buy these companies, to pump these companies like Gazprom and"
"6683720","6721880"," industries within Russia, Russia"
"6721880","6728560"," is still selling their oil through intermediaries, they can re-label it, they mix that shit into"

"7392820","7397800"," for not a better word, not for not having a better word, for weeding out scammers, for weeding out"
"7397800","7406400"," companies with bad ideas, weeding out old companies that are past their prime, right, that's"
"7406400","7413760"," actually part of the long-term debt cycle, clean house, but if we're in a short-term debt cycle"
"7413760","7417300"," right now, you want to see those things happening."
"7417620","7421600"," There are young people right now that complain they can't buy a house, they complain that they"
"7421600","7427820"," can't start a company, everything's too expensive, for you to get your next opportunity in our"
"7427820","7432380"," system, you need to see that cleaning of house."
"7432700","7435400"," You actually want to see tightening. "
"7436440","7439700"," If you're a bull, you want to see that tightening as well."
"7439960","7448720"," You don't want to be buying Peton for the next five years, not knowing that it's a farce, right?"
"7450180","7455900"," Within the long-term debt cycles, if you have multiple short-term debt cycles, it gives the"
"7455900","7458400"," opportunity for this market to continue to go higher."
"7459960","7467560"," So even though you might hear that the Fed's job is to keep people employed, their other job is to"
"7467560","7471440"," weed out companies and to strengthen our best companies. "
"7472060","7475940"," That actually does impact the workforce."
"7476820","7482500"," You've got people with the same skill sets and there's not enough jobs available, right?"
"7482500","7489540"," The other way that impacts inflation in our economy and shortages is some of these people that have"
"7489540","7495580"," an engineer and you're an engineer, and there was two of us were engineers, and there were two"
"7495580","7496440"," engineering jobs."
"7497080","7500140"," Let's say there was four, I can demand a higher wage. "
"7501080","7504420"," I can flip back and forth, but you and I can."
"7505080","7512380"," If these companies now only have one engineering position available, now I have to take less money"
"7512380","7513520"," and the other guy has never job."
"7513820","7519720"," The other guy is going to foreclose on his mortgage, and that housing will become available. "
"7520420","7528780"," It's kind of a weird process, but it is how our system works, how our economy works."
"7532270","7534670"," See if we can retest above here at this 385."
"7536630","7542910"," If we can start to squeeze past 35, we'll have a price target above of 388 into the bell. "
"7545720","7553300"," As a matter of fact, I started my first business in 2007-08 during the first recession with cash."
"7555020","7559840"," Everything was so cheap and it wasn't eligible for a loan."
"7560000","7564940"," It was a young guy, but I had cash on hand and it was easy for me to get into"
"7564940","7566620"," business during that recession. "
"7572260","7582520"," I'm using Pitot as an example, but in all truthless, it applies"
"7582520","7583280"," to many companies."
"7583580","7594160"," There are zombie companies all over the US that are telling you the truth, and"
"7594160","7597040"," they're going to get squeezed out in this tightening process."
"7597520","7604420"," You're going to see at some point once QT actually begins, you will see a promise. "
"7604640","7612040"," You will see masks banging on masks, but you'll see some pretty decent mid-sized businesses"
"7612040","7613660"," shutting their doors."
"7620890","7624210"," Let's see if this 385 is going to break through this 385 here."
"7635830","7637030"," We'll see if we get a rejection. "
"7637290","7638570"," We bought the bottom here at 380."
"7639710","7641770"," Kind of glad I was able to do this with you guys here today."
"7642550","7644990"," I am getting to print off those calls right now. "
"7646650","7648230"," Almost 100% right now."
"7654680","7655340"," Maybe not."
"7655960","7666860"," I think I'm"
"7666860","7667840"," at 50% right now. "
"7674230","7676230"," Next price target above is going to be 388."
"7682000","7682540"," You can see it."
"7683080","7685180"," Next mark is 3779. "
"7689450","7690030"," Yeah, that print."
"7690250","7691390"," My fucking call is a print."
"7693870","7695370"," My fucking call is a print. "
"7695730","7696330"," Fuck you all, Tagura."
"7696590","7698690"," Yes, you guys don't know who the fuck I am?"
"7700110","7701350"," Fuckin' do this shit live."
"7703900","7704840"," Fuckin' outta make money. "
"7705380","7706680"," Fuck is fuck's sake."
"7706680","7710720"," I always fucking people out there saying I don't make money in this fucking market are fucking"
"7710720","7711360"," liars."
"7713230","7714230"," Do this shit live. "
"7716250","7717210"," Fuckin' liars."
"7720140","7721880"," I start with 100 lots."
"7722300","7724260"," Then I go, then I add to about 300 usually. "
"7725080","7731220"," I used to go bigger, but I found that the more size I go, they know I'm doing it."
"7734680","7737420"," The market starts to hedge against you and stuff like that."
"7737580","7739160"," So I go smaller size now. "
"7744050","7745350"," You can't buy this stream."
"7745570","7746470"," I already know you can't."
"7746850","7751990"," I fucking know that each day you guys get at least one bitchin' trade for me. "
"7757250","7759990"," And I get to talk shit to you motherfuckers out there."
"7761170","7765230"," So you should probably take profit here if you're, you know, it's a good place to take profit."
"7765230","7771370"," I do think we talked about option A, B, and so our one, two, and three today, right?"
"7771630","7772370"," What do I think we're headed?"
"7773770","7775870"," So we have hit the first price target of 385. "
"7777330","7778610"," Do I think we can get to 388?"
"7779210","7779590"," Yeah, it's possible."
"7780210","7780450"," Not anti."
"7781390","7782610"," You've got, I've seen crazier things. "
"7782850","7788230"," If you guys want to see a 388, it's probably gonna be a problem."
"7791190","7797960"," How can I wonder in here why I'm not getting having some problems with book map right now."
"7797960","7798460"," I don't know why. "
"7803980","7805720"," But we can break through above here."
"7806260","7810460"," Now we could, what could happen here is there could be two things happen."
"7810880","7816380"," If you start to see, if you start to see squeezes, you're either gonna see something straight up. "
"7818920","7824060"," There could be more shorts, shorts put in place trying to get us back down in the street to set"
"7824060","7824580"," the market."
"7825660","7831300"," And the last one would be we trade sideways and then we squeeze up here right in the belt."
"7831300","7832520"," So that's 390. "
"7839860","7840620"," Fuck yeah."
"7843300","7844100"," You're welcome."
"7844940","7846720"," It's the best fucking stream out there. "
"7846760","7847660"," I'm fucking know it is."
"7851580","7854220"," Fuck yeah, you were in puts today too."
"7856440","7861760"," Yeah, we gotta talk about the future holds for us. "
"7864120","7866560"," We have to talk about what the future is."
"7866560","7874840"," We have to talk about if, we have to talk about, I can't stream, I want to stream every day."
"7875640","7877380"," I'm gonna have to start charging, I don't want to. "
"7878380","7879960"," But it's gonna be cheap I think so."
"7881760","7885240"," What I'm gonna try to do is offer something free all the time."
"7885720","7891640"," Either a morning stream so you guys be ready to go for the day and then two tears. "
"7891640","7897900"," It'd be like a monthly subscription for the live stream and then for some people want to support me"
"7897900","7899420"," with and have bank to support me."
"7899820","7902080"," I'll offer them like private stuff."
"7902380","7910000"," Yeah, you guys like making money right?"
"7915340","7919280"," Yeah, it has to, you know I don't want it to be that but I'm being forced into it. "
"7919620","7920600"," It kind of sucks."
"7921340","7923580"," It's not something I want to do."
"7924500","7931760"," I do promise you along the way that you'll never get like, I do promise you along the way that"
"7931760","7936600"," I'll never turn it into a for profit type thing. "
"7936840","7941580"," It'll never be like a, I'm here to make money off you guys."
"7942320","7946400"," It has to pay for the cost of putting the stream on, the time being here."
"7947900","7949360"," So that's all I'll ever become. "
"7951790","7952870"," I appreciate it."
"7960710","7964090"," Yeah, what to do is I'll show you guys what you guys do here."
"7964350","7970770"," If you wanted to take a lot of puts for Tuesday, I personally would be waiting. "
"7971070","7973430"," Personally, if you guys, I can't give you guys trade advice."
"7975170","7980350"," I'd be waiting for like, rage here."
"7982210","7983170"," Like 1644. "
"7983710","7984750"," Except the trade now."
"7987360","7992060"," But what I would do is, I'd be looking for, see what my cursor is right here?"
"7993120","8003080"," Are we looking to buy like three 75 P's expiring on Monday instead of"
"8003080","8004400"," the prices right now on those?"
"8005400","8006600"," You got to get some of that."
"8006680","8007440"," You got to get them cheap. "
"8008140","8013320"," Key is the item cheap and the last possible moment, tightening is key."
"8016440","8021060"," What you do is you grab like three 75 P's, somewhere up in here."
"8023360","8028180"," And we may not trade up there in the close, but you need that to happen to buy them. "
"8030000","8032880"," If we trade down to this clause, it'd be less."
"8034160","8035080"," We can buy them."
"8035160","8037560"," We just buy them like, we can buy them down here too, I guess. "
"8037740","8042140"," If we trade down here, we can buy someone in the bell because they're still going to attempt it."
"8042200","8043240"," They're going to attempt it here up here."
"8043240","8050620"," The preferred, the greed, the greed trade is that we trade up here to the bell. "
"8051580","8055940"," And you grab some, you grab some, we have time the money puts down here."
"8056600","8058560"," And they would set the market over the weekend."
"8059380","8060340"," It'd be a fucking bloodbath. "
"8060500","8060860"," It'd be nasty."
"8061740","8064620"," Now if we trade down, let's say we trade down into here to the bell."
"8066460","8068880"," And let's say you bought three 75's. "
"8069280","8070760"," They're not really going to print that much."
"8070920","8071360"," They're going to print well."
"8071360","8073540"," They might print like 100%. "
"8073540","8078760"," But the fucking problem is, let's say you dump it and then it swings back by open by 9.30,"
"8078920","8079740"," you get fucked on puts."
"8080840","8083340"," Maybe it's better to short, short globex."
"8083960","8084860"," That would be my thing. "
"8085440","8087600"," I would short globex here, short globex."
"8087860","8093100"," If we trade down into the bell, I wouldn't do cash RTH puts."
"8095260","8102240"," Down here, globex short, up here, anywhere in this vicinity here. "
"8104380","8108680"," Fucking cash market puts on that shit all day long."
"8108680","8109740"," Matter of fact, I'll buy these."
"8110120","8112240"," If we trade up here, I'll buy some down here again. "
"8124590","8125570"," Are we already in the subscription?"
"8126470","8127910"," Yeah, no, I haven't done it yet."
"8128130","8130850"," I want to, tomorrow and Saturday, we'll talk about it."
"8131590","8133470"," I will, I will lay out. "
"8134130","8135210"," What I'm going to do is this."
"8136950","8141030"," I'm going to give you, I'm going to try to give you one to three options."
"8143560","8147760"," You guys will tell me, we'll do a live stream. "
"8147900","8149740"," I'll put a poll out."
"8151280","8158720"," And I've been talking to some of the longtime followers about what they want to see and we'll see"
"8158720","8164380"," if, we'll see which one it is."
"8164820","8167060"," Now, I know I'm not going to make everybody happy. "
"8168140","8172440"," So, my second part of this conversation is going to be this."
"8175160","8180300"," If too many people get pissed off at whatever the solution is, like I know I'm going to make some"
"8180300","8181280"," people upset already."
"8181400","8182900"," I know I'm going to make some people fine with it. "
"8182960","8184520"," I know some people are going to be happy for it."
"8185540","8193639"," But I do know that if everyone's pissed off, the option I was considering was just shut it all down"
"8193639","8195400"," and just trade."
"8196540","8198520"," So, which I don't want. "
"8198700","8199879"," I prefer doing this with you guys."
"8200040","8201400"," I love, I love doing this with you guys."
"8202219","8202920"," Fucking love it. "
"8202920","8208580"," So, if I pissed too many people off, we'll just shut it all down."
"8211040","8212299"," But I love doing this with you."
"8212420","8212820"," I love you guys. "
"8212980","8214940"," I want to see you guys take money all the fucking time."
"8215580","8216420"," Without a fucking doubt."
"8217879","8219160"," Like, I'm here to make money. "
"8219840","8221420"," Yeah, that's the other thing."
"8221840","8222959"," Teddy's asking a good question."
"8223240","8229680"," So, unlike where I'm here and not here, you would get a defined when I'm here for what you're"
"8229680","8229940"," getting. "
"8229940","8232040"," So, you will know in advance."
"8232500","8232879"," Not advance."
"8233100","8234000"," You'll know when you sign up. "
"8234559","8238379"," Hey, you're getting capped five days a week from this time to this time."
"8239120","8244459"," You'll get notice in advance of normal vacations, normal market stuff."
"8244680","8247520"," Like if we're closed on, I don't know, whatever day. "
"8247780","8250120"," You'll get exactly what you're paying for."
"8250799","8253500"," I'll meet those expectations for you."
"8254760","8257280"," So, you can decide, hey, I want to pay for this. "
"8257280","8258840"," Hey, I want to get this for my buck."
"8259600","8260500"," Whatever that is."
"8260500","8265400"," There won't be any kind of like, there won't be like, hey, I don't show up today or whatever like"
"8265400","8266219"," that kind of stuff. "
"8268320","8274760"," So, if I do pick, if it does go into a paid subscription from my end, I do realize that"
"8275420","8276860"," you can hold me to expectations."
"8277440","8277900"," Not just here."
"8278020","8278580"," I had a great trade. "
"8279139","8279780"," I tipped you."
"8281299","8281900"," Trust me."
"8282000","8284379"," I don't like this fucking, I don't want to do this subscription thing. "
"8285680","8287639"," If I could stay with just tips."
"8289280","8292559"," If I could, hey, thanks Matt for supporting the chat."
"8292700","8293260"," I appreciate it. "
"8295799","8301500"," If I could stay with tips, the tips, the tips system I would, but I can't."
"8301840","8305459"," I'm getting fucking steamrolled by fucking social media."
"8307000","8309000"," They want me to sell you something. "
"8309299","8310360"," They want something tangible."
"8311059","8313160"," They want you to be able to say I bought this."
"8315600","8316660"," So, that's what it is. "
"8316760","8324000"," That's truly the last, the straw that broke the camel's back was trying to circumvent that."
"8324639","8327200"," And they PayPal found out about it was like, fuck no."
"8327299","8329719"," Well, they're like, you're good for now, but you're going to get fucked. "
"8330980","8333260"," So, they're like, I'll explain it."
"8333320","8334719"," I explained it earlier in the stream today."
"8334860","8336260"," I'll explain it better tomorrow. "
"8336360","8337860"," Or at least I'll type something out."
"8338020","8342719"," Maybe send you or post something for you guys to get a better grasp of what I'm talking about."
"8342719","8344320"," So, I'm being forced into it. "
"8344559","8352340"," I'm basically being fucking forced into, you know, if I was just doing a post on Twitter, I"
"8352340","8353520"," wouldn't charge shit for that."
"8353879","8356700"," If I was doing just a video, maybe charge nothing."
"8357580","8358580"," Three bucks, five bucks. "
"8359580","8364580"," I wouldn't post shit for just doing paper, but the production that goes into, the time and effort"
"8364580","8369180"," that goes into, and the cost of doing this live stream, it's fucking stupid."
"8369900","8370219"," It sucks."
"8374030","8374830"," It fucking sucks. "
"8374830","8376250"," So, that's what it is."
"8376590","8382870"," But I think it's a better, I think it's a better system though than selling you videos."
"8383309","8389250"," If I sold you a class dude, telling you, there's no fucking way that a class is ever going to"
"8389250","8396750"," give you, ever going to give you a better classroom environment than trading with me day in day"
"8396750","8396910"," out. "
"8397650","8398130"," Never."
"8398690","8399170"," Never."
"8399650","8403830"," If you spent 20 bucks a month for a year, what's that?"
"8404090","8404450"," 200 bucks?"
"8405030","8406650"," That's cheaper than any class out there. "
"8408210","8410430"," There's some free classes people offer, but those are bullshit."
"8411330","8415270"," But if you had a class for 200 bucks, the best class you could buy, fucking period."
"8416690","8418490"," You guys have to understand something, okay?"
"8419130","8423870"," I've paid alpha guys to live stream hundreds. "
"8425070","8426090"," 600 is the most I've spent."
"8426450","8428050"," They're only there twice a week for a couple hours."
"8428050","8429830"," And they're never there to pivot moments. "
"8431370","8431710"," Ever."
"8432810","8435330"," So, I already know that whatever it is, dirt cheap it is."
"8435930","8438510"," There's no way that it's going to be not worth its value. "
"8439090","8441190"," So, I'll make sure you guys again what you're paying for it."
"8442710","8443970"," But it has to pay for it."
"8444170","8446470"," I need it most of the pay for the stream to take place. "
"8447750","8449990"," I need to pay for it for me to be here."
"8455420","8456380"," No, I know what it is."
"8456560","8459220"," If any of you guys are just trying to explain it, I'll explain it once more real quick. "
"8459460","8460280"," So, basically it's this."
"8464600","8467180"," I'm not going to go out and rehash the entire thing."
"8467520","8468940"," But it basically just is this. "
"8469880","8471020"," I am a payment processor."
"8473880","8480020"," So, if you sell goods and services, I have a package for you how to get paid for that."
"8480340","8484200"," If you want money from your mother, your brother, your sister, I have a package for that, right?"
"8484440","8484800"," Friends and family. "
"8485780","8487980"," If you're selling a good service, I have a package for that."
"8489680","8491480"," And these are the tools you can use."
"8491480","8495940"," Now, now you have social media companies. "
"8498060","8500960"," And some have done well at this and some have done worse at this."
"8501340","8502720"," YouTube has done a better job than Twitter."
"8503940","8505580"," Twitter basically has just tip-up. "
"8506180","8509060"," YouTube is rolling out like subscriptions all its other nonsense."
"8509480","8514240"," But even them rolling out subscriptions in tip-cups, it's fucking horrific."
"8514580","8516340"," It's not like buying an actual good service. "
"8517120","8518960"," So, now they're differentiating between them."
"8518960","8523700"," Like, let's say you bought a magazine every month versus a YouTube stream."
"8525020","8529200"," It's still considered different because they're making money off it. "
"8529480","8531280"," More so than a magazine subscription."
"8532180","8534640"," So, if you bought a magazine subscription, there's a rate that you pay."
"8535940","8542500"," So, if you pay a rate, let's say you pay a rate of 3% for a magazine subscription. "
"8542920","8543260"," So, subscription."
"8544320","8546320"," YouTube's subscription is like 30%."
"8547280","8548820"," And then, on top of that, you pay taxes. "
"8549280","8550680"," So, I might get like 50%."
"8551920","8552860"," So, that reinforces."
"8553520","8554720"," You guys are just all fucked up. "
"8555180","8556760"," That reinforces, right?"
"8558260","8559800"," Let's say I needed 100 subscribers."
"8561340","8566840"," So, now that 50% of that money is going to YouTube and taxes, now I have to get 200"
"8566840","8567380"," subscribers."
"8568200","8572700"," So, if you need to get 200 subscribers, I then have to try to sell more. "
"8572960","8573480"," Does that make sense?"
"8573480","8574800"," I'm still selling more."
"8575420","8577440"," I have to do more work on the sell side."
"8577900","8579220"," I have to make it more slick. "
"8579880","8581240"," And I probably have to charge more."
"8581660","8583500"," So, there's like this rolling."
"8584120","8586820"," So, you get rolled into doing more and more. "
"8588920","8591040"," More and more work and then more and more selling."
"8591900","8593820"," That instead of talking to 100 of you."
"8593920","8594580"," I have to talk to 200. "
"8595140","8597620"," If I talk to 200, I have to talk to 300, right?"
"8597620","8604460"," So, you start to have to, you're selling something rather than giving a legitimate service."
"8605520","8610420"," So, if I'm able to keep it like a magazine subscription, I don't need as many people."
"8610620","8611800"," I don't need to charge as much. "
"8612140","8612700"," You get savings."
"8613760","8616660"," The money goes more direct to supporting me."
"8619100","8619720"," Excuse me. "
"8620080","8621160"," Yeah, you have to drink water here."
"8628500","8631800"," So, I have to do something along those lines to support the channel."
"8632880","8635240"," So, with all that shit said, right?"
"8635860","8641860"," It's only getting worse because if you're not doing the magazine subscription model, let's say"
"8641860","8648780"," you're doing the tip subscription model, the other fucked up part is that they can, they froze my"
"8648780","8649320"," account once. "
"8649580","8653580"," The tips you guys are giving me, they froze and I ended up having a meeting with someone from"
"8653580","8654480"," PayPal about it."
"8655820","8659940"," And it was because I was taking tips because they don't know what you're getting."
"8659940","8660960"," There's nothing tangible. "
"8661460","8666740"," And they're like, well, you're getting all these different amounts from people and we can't, we"
"8666740","8668320"," don't know what you're giving them."
"8668720","8672040"," And so, I had to go through my channel and what I do and they're like, okay, well, it's slide"
"8672040","8672540"," right now."
"8675210","8680910"," But some other people that I know that I've since met had their tip cups. "
"8681790","8686890"," If you're getting like tips for like $5, $20, $30 a month on Twitter, my YouTube is no big deal."
"8686890","8692870"," But if you're getting something that's helping to produce the show, so many people have had, they"
"8692870","8697450"," can have, let's say you have like $1,000 in the accounts or $2,000."
"8697850","8700730"," Let's see if three months with the money in there and you just haven't touched it. "
"8700730","8702150"," They can freeze it at any time."
"8702710","8708550"," Not only can they freeze it at any time, but then they can take that money and never, never fund"
"8708550","8711710"," it to you, close your accounts and just tell you your fuck."
"8711710","8713350"," Sometimes I can tell you anything. "
"8714670","8719310"," And then it has to do with chargebacks, it has to do with fraud."
"8719630","8722310"," It's not real fraud, they think it's fraud in the accounts."
"8722670","8725270"," It's like these algorithms that think you're fraud based. "
"8727410","8728930"," So, it's just all fucked up."
"8729050","8731210"," They haven't frozen my PayPal account at this point, by the way."
"8731730","8737130"," But, you know, the fact that I'm a, they're whim because I'm not providing you with a tangible"
"8737130","8737550"," good. "
"8737550","8740270"," The fact that they can just say, fuck you."
"8740750","8742190"," You know, you didn't get this."
"8742650","8746830"," Or we can't prove that they paid you for this service. "
"8747470","8748850"," I have to provide you with them."
"8748910","8751690"," We have to say to you, you got one month of live streams."
"8752310","8753310"," There they were, right?"
"8753750","8755490"," You got a newsletter from me. "
"8755730","8756310"," There it was."
"8756530","8757330"," You got the new stream."
"8757490","8759670"," I have the record of you getting it, right?"
"8760870","8767710"," So, from their end, from protecting themselves and then not wanting me just getting, like, it could"
"8767710","8769110"," be fucking selling drugs, I guess. "
"8769810","8773370"," It could be selling fucking ivory tusks or something."
"8773970","8776890"," Maybe sell, you know, there could be some nefarious shit that I'm doing."
"8782420","8783520"," I appreciate that, Marcus. "
"8787550","8789250"," Well, so I do that right now."
"8789530","8790670"," So, there's a problem for that."
"8791090","8792830"," So, there is that right now. "
"8792830","8795630"," So, if you look, there's a couple things."
"8795910","8796830"," On the back end, right?"
"8797670","8806210"," From the back end, if I've looked at that model, like, I leave just a tip cup somewhere else and"
"8806210","8807450"," they show that no one tips."
"8808270","8812430"," When you leave the top, let's say I leave a tip cup on, like, a patreon or something like that. "
"8813050","8814090"," It doesn't work."
"8814490","8816830"," No, excuse me, excuse me."
"8817570","8818750"," I'm mixing my words here. "
"8819170","8820830"," So, let's say I leave a tip cup."
"8820830","8823790"," Right now, I leave a tip cup on YouTube in the description."
"8824650","8827870"," I leave a tip cup on Twitter, right?"
"8828350","8829530"," It's not a part of Twitter. "
"8829930","8831330"," I leave a tip cup on YouTube."
"8831890","8833330"," It's not a part of YouTube's program."
"8833750","8834590"," This is, like, separate. "
"8835430","8836910"," That money goes direct to me."
"8838530","8843730"," Those tips slowly, slowly, over time, bled off."
"8845450","8850210"," You need to be, you're almost forced to be integrated with these social media platforms. "
"8850210","8852150"," For you to get tips."
"8852870","8860970"," The other issue is that, from their end, they have frozen my account when I've done this."
"8861530","8864270"," So, when you roll into the subscription model, right?"
"8864810","8867710"," I can do that and it won't get my account frozen. "
"8868590","8872670"," Now, even when I do the subscription model, it still has to be off-site."
"8873190","8878050"," Like, there's no integrated tip jar on this video you're watching right now."
"8878050","8880350"," I don't do an integrated tip cup. "
"8880350","8885710"," Well, I do an integrated tip cup on Twitter, but you can't see it on desktop, I don't think."
"8886210","8887950"," I think only on phone you can."
"8888630","8889990"," It's not built for that. "
"8890630","8895170"," So, what I have to do, what I think I'm going to have to do is go off-site to"
"8895170","8897970"," a Patreon and do a private live stream there."
"8898430","8906590"," You'll get a live stream that's public there or either on YouTube or on Patreon, but I would take"
"8906590","8907830"," you off-site to Patreon."
"8908450","8912470"," You would get a free live stream to a certain time period and then it would switch over to a"
"8912470","8914990"," private live stream for the rest of the day. "
"8917590","8918430"," It's really fucked up."
"8919150","8920470"," I'm fucking pissed off."
"8923570","8925030"," I know Jim's only fans. "
"8925670","8928190"," I'll be fucking selling fucking nudes in the back fucking 40."
"8930750","8931710"," Holy shit."
"8932010","8933050"," Brendan, thank you for subscribing. "
"8933570","8935190"," BD, thank you for supporting the channel."
"8935570","8936770"," James, thank you for supporting the channel."
"8937490","8939610"," Matthew Philip, thank you for supporting the channel. "
"8940210","8941190"," My brother's."
"8945410","8951430"," I wish Winky was here right now to help explain it because he knows Winky's been a streamer in the"
"8951430","8951650"," past."
"8952630","8954210"," I think it was a Twitch streamer. "
"8954770","8958970"," And any streamers of sites, it's fucking brutal."
"8959750","8964570"," It's not easy to make it work."
"8964830","8969290"," And not only does it not easy to make it work, if I was playing a video game, my cost"
"8969290","8970850"," of doing business would be lower. "
"8971770","8976050"," But the market information, the fact that we're here making money, it's completely fucking"
"8976050","8976290"," different."
"8976690","8979150"," It's a whole different fucking, it's a whole different game."
"8979830","8987510"," If I was playing, if this isn't down, or speaking down to video games, it's that, you know, if"
"8987510","8996170"," you're, let's say I'm playing a video game, I'm not paying every month $2,000 to play that video"
"8996170","8996430"," game. "
"8997770","9000890"," That's why I'm paying just in services, services right now."
"9000930","9009190"," It's like $1,500 to $2,000 that I'm paying in services, just, just to give you guys this"
"9009190","9012470"," information, if that makes sense."
"9012770","9017270"," And then, and then on top of all that, I'm trading, right?"
"9017730","9022050"," So I got my own trading and then the eight hours every day, it's expensive. "
"9023290","9024310"," So that's all I'm trying to cover."
"9024310","9029310"," I'm not trying to cover, like, I'm not trying to, you'll never see me fucking trying to make money"
"9029310","9029450"," out."
"9029530","9030130"," You'll never see it. "
"9031350","9033370"," So, if you do see it, fucking quit."
"9034970","9039850"," If you see like some kind of fucking crackhead fucking, see me like start fucking looking like a"
"9039850","9042130"," fucking, you know who they are."
"9043130","9044410"," You know what they look"
"9044410","9054290"," like. "
"9054810","9055710"," They're not as good."
"9056030","9060450"," As a matter of fact, past couple weeks, my P&L's are fucking through the roof because I'm not"
"9060450","9061250"," focusing on streaming."
"9062130","9063950"," So there is some of that aspect as well. "
"9064190","9067250"," I was talking to jazz about it off-stream earlier today."
"9067670","9068290"," It's complicated."
"9068810","9069090"," It's not. "
"9069950","9074870"," Like, part of this, I don't want to tell you guys because I'm like, oh man, like fucking, they"
"9074870","9075730"," don't want to hear this shit."
"9075870","9081830"," I'm like, but I got to tell people that I trust because they got to be like, they got to"
"9081830","9082550"," be honest about this."
"9082550","9090450"," I was wondering if there's a way for me to like, like release publicly what, like, I don't know if"
"9090450","9090950"," I can do it monthly. "
"9091330","9095590"," There's no, I don't think there's a software to do it monthly where I can adjust your monthly fees."
"9095790","9097250"," It would be too complicated without it being automated."
"9098030","9103010"," But I think that maybe after like, maybe I released like how many, how many members we have, how"
"9103010","9105230"," much costs are every three months or six months. "
"9105830","9111010"," Or maybe once a year, I could do something where it's like once every six months or once every year"
"9111010","9113470"," where I'm like, this is the number of subscribers we had."
"9114030","9115370"," There's so much money we took in."
"9116410","9117630"," There's other taxes that are paid. "
"9117930","9118590"," Taxes that are paid."
"9119430","9121250"," The fees that we paid to run the stream."
"9122610","9126810"," And this is what your, this is what the monthly fee will be next time, next year, or next six"
"9126810","9127490"," months or whatever. "
"9128390","9131750"," So we could run some, we could do something like that where it's more transparent."
"9133090","9134710"," Cause I'm not, I'll be honest with you, I'm not interested."
"9135270","9138330"," Dude, I've been approached, there's people in the stream right now that are approached. "
"9138330","9141110"," I mean, good people to monetize this."
"9141470","9143730"," I could, I could fucking monetize this shit tomorrow."
"9144410","9145270"," And I'm not doing it. "
"9146070","9148470"," If you're just not going to see me do that, I don't want to be in this fucking business."
"9149270","9153630"," I have no fucking wants to be like, I don't want to be fucking driving Lamborghini."
"9153750","9157410"," I'm a fucking rental Lamborghini and fucking part of my hair and have the sides. "
"9157670","9159290"," I'm not, I'm not, no fancy way out there."
"9159330","9159830"," It looks like that."
"9160270","9162450"," Or is that personal of all the other everybody. "
"9162670","9164050"," But for me, it's not who I am."
"9166830","9168190"," So you just never see me that guy."
"9170330","9171310"," I make a money trade. "
"9171590","9175350"," I don't need, I don't, I don't need to like have a career as a streamer."
"9175830","9177890"," It's not, it's not like, it wasn't my goal."
"9178170","9181650"," My goal wasn't the, my goal was not, it still isn't to be a streamer. "
"9181730","9184010"," My goal is to help other traders along the way."
"9184510","9185730"," I think it makes me feel good doing it."
"9186150","9191950"," So if we can somehow, somehow formulate that to happen, that's what we'll do. "
"9192410","9193130"," There's no other way."
"9193130","9197410"," If we can't do it dude, like, 100% fucking truth."
"9197910","9201730"," If we can't fucking get that shit done, we'll just shut it down. "
"9202330","9203870"," I'll just fuck around with you guys on Twitter."
"9204290","9208210"," We'll just fucking, fucking play ping pong Twitter all day long."
"9218290","9226610"," I know, like, shut up like a fucking, a fucking, a fucking pastel blue fucking, a fucking polo"
"9226610","9229290"," shirt, some douchebag fucking pants on. "
"9230290","9232210"," Fucking get my douchebag on."
"9236790","9238470"," Oh yeah, no, you'll see Lost Trade."
"9238650","9241010"," You guys, you guys know, that's the thing. "
"9241170","9242530"," That's what I think."
"9242530","9246250"," There's some differences in my, so from my niche, right?"
"9246470","9249950"," Like with the, the difference between me, everybody's got the thing that they do well."
"9250390","9253270"," Like, you know, there are guys out there that do great written reports. "
"9253830","9256690"," You know, there are guys out there that do really good newsletters."
"9257630","9261050"," There are guys out there that do really good educational videos."
"9262330","9266130"," Tastyworks, guys who are for Tastyworks, dude, there's kick ass training videos. "
"9266690","9270290"," There are guys out there that do great fucking discords."
"9270290","9274810"," There are guys out there that do great recaps every night, right?"
"9276250","9279270"," There are guys out there that focus on Isalia Wave theory, right?"
"9279510","9280410"," That's with all they do."
"9281690","9287910"," So I just think for what I do, I think for what I do, I think it feels like a"
"9287910","9288990"," needed niche. "
"9290930","9296590"," I didn't have anyone with, when I first started trading the first few years, I didn't have someone"
"9296590","9299050"," to trade with day in, day out."
"9299050","9300170"," And I wish I had had that."
"9300210","9301890"," I wouldn't have made as many mistakes. "
"9302630","9306910"," I didn't, if you, some of you guys have been trading for a long time."
"9307070","9310350"," If you guys are watching right now, I fucking know."
"9310690","9312750"," If you've been trading for like one to five years, okay?"
"9313890","9318730"," You're, you'll start to figure out that there's so much that you didn't know about the market. "
"9319330","9323730"," But like, dude, when I look back, like when I look back honestly, but first like three to five"
"9323730","9330370"," years of trading, there was so much shit going on in the market that I was oblivious to."
"9330910","9333050"," Because I was fucking completely oblivious to."
"9333870","9338190"," Or when I had a trade fail, I would have no idea why it failed. "
"9339110","9340210"," Like, that was the worst one."
"9340490","9342430"," Like, if I have a trade fail, now I know why it fails."
"9344730","9349310"," If I, most of my trades, when they fail, I know why they're failing and no one to pull the"
"9349310","9349510"," plug. "
"9350030","9351270"," I know why to pull the plug."
"9354010","9359470"," But if you guys learn that stuff with me along the way, you can't pay for that in a recap"
"9359470","9362610"," video on, on, on YouTube the night before."
"9362910","9365990"," You can't pay for that with a pre-recorded lesson. "
"9366390","9367770"," I don't think you can't pay for it."
"9367810","9369050"," I bought the, I bought classes."
"9369650","9371550"," I got a fucking stack of those fucking classes. "
"9372130","9373190"," I got bought classes."
"9373850","9378710"," I fucking, I used to watch the YouTube recap videos and they, for their good, give you good levels,"
"9378710","9380650"," what to expect, what to do."
"9381210","9383790"," If you have time in market, they work really well. "
"9384330","9389190"," But the real, like, in and out of day, in and out of day, in and out, that kind of"
"9389190","9389430"," stuff."
"9391610","9394890"," Consuming the market, paying attention to the market 24 hours a day."
"9395590","9398610"," Like, being with someone else doing that, you can't fucking pay for that shit. "
"9399190","9403690"," I've paid for alpha guys that are like, they'll show up to you free and stream a couple days a"
"9403690","9403890"," week."
"9404590","9405670"," Then it's always on their schedule."
"9405670","9409790"," They'll be like, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be there on Thursday or Friday at one o'clock. "
"9410930","9411950"," And you're like, well, fuck me."
"9412030","9413130"," What could happen at one o'clock?"
"9413890","9414930"," Tell you the prime example."
"9415710","9416630"," Tell you the prime example. "
"9417210","9419410"," I was trying to get out at nine thirty, but I fucking couldn't."
"9420670","9421570"," But I was trying."
"9422870","9424090"," But you, tell you the prime example. "
"9424230","9427370"," If you didn't have an alpha guy there at nine, at nine thirty, we fucked, right?"
"9428390","9431930"," If you didn't have an alpha guy telling you that morning, if you, if we broke three ninety, then"
"9431930","9433830"," we're gonna get, then you're gonna get butt fucked, right?"
"9433830","9436350"," You, you're gonna get fucked up in the market if we break."
"9436470","9437870"," That's a key pivot, right?"
"9438250","9439310"," Putting that chart this morning."
"9439550","9440570"," You break that three ninety. "
"9441590","9442790"," It's going down, right?"
"9442950","9443770"," We went down, right?"
"9445430","9448930"," You can't pay for that stuff unless you have someone there with your trade and day in and day out."
"9449290","9450770"," There's just no way to pay for it."
"9451770","9453390"," I don't think that there is. "
"9458980","9461640"," I can't post the discord right now, but I will post it."
"9461640","9468660"," I'll post the discord in, uh, in the, um, ad captain's awful later today."
"9468760","9469640"," I'll post the link to it. "
"9470740","9476960"," My stream, I'm running the stream right now at a fucking, on a, at a fucking, like, one tire and,"
"9477000","9481060"," like, two cylinders broken fucking windshield wipers that's raining outside."
"9486440","9487600"," Yeah, I, I preach."
"9487820","9490060"," All right, all you guys out there know I preach it out to all of you. "
"9490620","9491680"," 100 fucking percent."
"9496040","9497600"," Damn, that's what, this sucks, man."
"9498520","9500980"," They're going to fucking bleed this shit off right to the end. "
"9503460","9504100"," Fucking brutal."
"9507680","9508480"," Fucking brutal."
"9511680","9513000"," And there's nobody there. "
"9514420","9515660"," No resistance here."
"9517920","9519520"," No buyers, no resistance."
"9523340","9524820"," All the puts are still off. "
"9525660","9527300"," Let me tell me, matter of fact, they even check to see."
"9536410","9540090"," Yeah, that, that, if you guys look right now, I don't know how you guys, how many of you guys"
"9540090","9541250"," can look inside an options chain."
"9541250","9544590"," There, and there's an intentional pin in the market right now. "
"9544690","9547270"," 380 P worth 11 cents."
"9548270","9549550"," And they don't give a fuck."
"9550210","9553650"," They're trying to hold this, this is a, this is a bank doing this right now. "
"9554370","9556470"," Sacrifice the puts for the shorts."
"9557330","9560790"," Probably setting up for a large move down into Monday, if they can."
"9561470","9564590"," Let's take a look on Monday's options chain as well. "
"9567140","9571240"," Still, there's 139,000 puts for Monday for 380 P."
"9571240","9577720"," And it only gets nastier."
"9578520","9580960"," As you go down the road, it gets nastier."
"9581260","9583700"," 20,000 puts on 380 P for the 25th. "
"9584240","9585520"," Another stack at 370."
"9588600","9589860"," It's for the 25th, right?"
"9596020","9597420"," 27th was stacked at 375."
"9599740","9600540"," And a 360. "
"9601300","9601640"," Look at that."
"9602280","9608140"," On May 27th, stacks of puts, 360 P."
"9610540","9615020"," May 31st, they don't even have them, they don't even have them there."
"9615940","9620200"," They're all gunning for 360 by May 27th. "
"9621760","9623480"," That's some fucking wild shit."
"9626940","9628840"," A little bit of 350s out there."
"9631960","9633700"," 350s for June 1st. "
"9638770","9639070"," Nasty."
"9640570","9643650"," I'm going to go look at a June of 21st."
"9646190","9647430"," Big blocks at 350. "
"9651440","9653120"," Even have some out there at 275."
"9654180","9655140"," I think they're crazy."
"9658000","9659500"," I think they're bad shit craze. "
"9659580","9660620"," I don't know who the fuck bought those."
"9668610","9670830"," I have to go through the options chant in the day today."
"9674260","9675920"," And have that ready for you guys on Saturday. "
"9688070","9689030"," And they want blood."
"9690770","9693410"," Right here, ready June 17th."
"9694290","9695890"," 65,000 puts on 368. "
"9697550","9698550"," It's a big one."
"9698610","9699810"," It's a fucking big one."
"9700650","9702270"," And we're not even there yet. "
"9704050","9707550"," They don't give a fuck."
"9708390","9708990"," Brutal."
"9712610","9714170"," Absolutely fucking brutal. "
"9716930","9718830"," Dweis Boyfriend, thanks for all you do brother."
"9722140","9723960"," Now you guys can understand that."
"9724180","9728680"," You guys can understand that puts, but large put positions are not always used. "
"9729920","9731340"," For what you think there be."
"9731440","9735940"," It's not like you've got hedging for long positions in the market."
"9736280","9739780"," Let's talk about options. "
"9743000","9744120"," We'll talk about that."
"9744260","9744960"," We'll get some time right here."
"9746400","9747700"," Let's talk about options real quick. "
"9748260","9748740"," It's a good question."
"9749640","9750560"," People forget this stuff."
"9751400","9753020"," So let's say I am a bank. "
"9754300","9755900"," And I am one."
"9755900","9758400"," I'm a long only hedge fund."
"9760000","9761480"," And I own Apple. "
"9762960","9763920"," Where I own the spy."
"9764260","9770720"," As a matter of fact, if any of you guys out there are wealthy, you always want to own the"
"9770720","9770960"," spy."
"9771180","9771760"," S&P 500. "
"9775660","9777560"," That's a different talk for a different time."
"9778900","9782060"," But the more money that you make you want to always be buying the spy."
"9782860","9784340"," So let's say I buy the spy, okay?"
"9785660","9786740"," I buy the spy. "
"9788940","9791360"," So let's say I buy the spy for $300."
"9792800","9796580"," So I buy a share of the spy or the ETF, right?"
"9799300","9800560"," And we're trading up."
"9800680","9801240"," We're trading up. "
"9801260","9801900"," We're trading up."
"9802080","9802400"," We're trading up."
"9802400","9802460"," We're trading up. "
"9802460","9802520"," We're trading up."
"9802520","9802600"," We'll see."
"9802700","9803740"," We're trading like 400. "
"9805520","9806920"," I'm happy that pig and shit."
"9808300","9813630"," And my advisor tells me, well, you should put some protection on, right?"
"9813630","9815830"," Well, we're not even talking about some calls and some puts."
"9816470","9820190"," But we have some danger in the economy, some danger in the market. "
"9821030","9823330"," And then like, hey, Cap, you should put some protection on."
"9823890","9825050"," Or I even know."
"9825350","9826670"," We're at 400 and I go, fuck. "
"9827370","9828430"," I put some protection on."
"9828850","9831010"," I've got all of these spy shares."
"9831370","9833050"," I've got some protection on regardless, right?"
"9834250","9838630"," So I'm going to put a putback spread on, a ratio spread, right?"
"9839410","9843590"," And that's basically where I'm buying and selling a putt and then buying and outside the money"
"9843590","9843870"," call. "
"9844350","9845150"," I think I got that right."
"9846150","9849670"," And it makes money if the market goes down and makes money if the market goes up."
"9849790","9850130"," Doesn't matter. "
"9850610","9851810"," It's like right away, right?"
"9852090","9852470"," Right away."
"9853070","9854350"," I own the underlying."
"9854890","9855490"," I do. "
"9855590","9856470"," Captain Jim James does."
"9856710","9861580"," I buy a putt because I'm scared of a market crash, right?"
"9864670","9872230"," The moment I buy that putt, the dealer has to sell a share to cover that bet."
"9872450","9873090"," Does that make sense?"
"9873410","9874810"," You got any guys out there?"
"9875590","9877490"," And as long as I hold that putt, right?"
"9878210","9882710"," And I'm going to hold that putt for expiration just in case for market crash, right?"
"9882770","9883330"," I only bought it. "
"9883490","9884110"," It's cheap, right?"
"9884590","9886670"," Let's say I own fucking spy three and a bucks."
"9887250","9889730"," What does it cost me to buy some fucking outside the money puts?"
"9890390","9891610"," It costs me nothing, right?"
"9891850","9894490"," If that investor at 400 bucks, I got a putback spread."
"9895070","9895830"," Does it cost me shit?"
"9898910","9900130"," So everyone's doing this. "
"9900230","9900890"," It becomes amplified."
"9901550","9903570"," So I know you're going to always putts in the market."
"9903570","9905990"," So spy starts to trade down, right?"
"9906110","9910610"," It becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy where the market starts to trade down because the"
"9910610","9915250"," dealers are selling the market and you've got all this gamma from fucking puts being bought. "
"9917800","9920400"," Meanwhile, you've got other people getting scared, right?"
"9921300","9922740"," And then so you've got other people getting scared."
"9922880","9926740"," So you've got real money sellers because you'll have panic and just sell their positions."
"9928120","9932400"," On top of that, you've got hedge funds wanting to capitalize on this panic, right?"
"9933200","9934840"," So they start shorting the market, right?"
"9934840","9937260"," Barrow and shares to short it. "
"9939660","9943280"," Well, if I'm a hedge funder, let's say I'm a hedge fund that likes to short, right?"
"9943580","9949720"," If I'm a hedge fund that shorts and I'm in a short position, I can amplify that short."
"9950120","9951280"," I can go out and just buy puts."
"9952120","9955480"," I can just use cheap-ass puts to make market swings. "
"9956800","9961680"," I can use an algorithm and computers to swing the market where I want it to be."
"9963400","9966300"," To print some kind of big spread that I have on, right?"
"9966400","9970860"," Let's say I've got a big huge dollar spread and I'm going to print on it."
"9971160","9974380"," Well, let's say I've got this huge short position that I need to get printed, right?"
"9976530","9977690"," I think it's even more complicated. "
"9979430","9984050"," This is when I'm selling calls, right?"
"9984150","9990530"," At the same time, selling calls and the underlying stock that I own have spied already knowing that"
"9990530","9991990"," it's going to go down, right?"
"9991990","9992990"," So I'm selling calls."
"9993570","9996330"," At the same time, I'm shorting the stock that I own."
"9997690","9998990"," And then I'll get protection on. "
"9999370","10003010"," And then you realize that the amplification is going on with other smaller players."
"10007790","10012870"," It's like this reinforcing reinforcement that the market goes down."
"10013590","10015290"," And usually these coincide with dates. "
"10016410","10023210"," Once either the risk is removed or the date is removed, and then all that protection is taken off."
"10023410","10024870"," You'll see a snapback."
"10025050","10026450"," We're a rally in the market. "
"10031000","10032300"," You guys even understand this stuff?"
"10033180","10034240"," Probably fucking not."
"10036830","10038530"," Let me tell you a little bit about my position."
"10043260","10044160"," Oh, sweet Jesus. "
"10045520","10046920"," Oops, he probably shouldn't have said that."
"10048950","10051110"," Calls in the fucking green, baby."
"10051930","10053270"," Calls in the green. "
"10056820","10064380"," Let's see if we can find a price target reaching up right now to VWAP at 38.50. A price"
"10064380","10065820"," target above is still 388."
"10066420","10067960"," We'll see if we can get there into the bell."
"10080650","10083550"," So Lord Pentes said, I thought the bank sold puts. "
"10085790","10087830"," You guys look at what a college trade is."
"10089750","10094490"," So if I want to share a spy, I can sell puts and calls."
"10094890","10097830"," If I want to share a spy, let's say we're at 400. "
"10097830","10100890"," And I know it's going down."
"10101070","10102490"," I know there's panic in the market."
"10106280","10107980"," I can sell calls. "
"10108700","10110200"," Let's say we trade all the way down to 300."
"10112460","10117940"," Let's say I think we're at 400 and I go, you know the next month, probably going down to 300."
"10118300","10119280"," I can sell calls, right?"
"10120580","10122320"," We're not going to get back there if we bounced. "
"10124140","10127200"," Once we're down below to that 300, I can sell puts down there."
"10127580","10128840"," On the underlying security."
"10129680","10132100"," Does that make sense, right?"
"10132300","10133840"," Then there's a whole other thing we can do. "
"10133940","10138100"," Pour me in covered calls and pour me in covered put."
"10138280","10142880"," I don't know if you can do covered calls or covered puts maybe."
"10143100","10144180"," You might be able to, but I'm not sure. "
"10145200","10146860"," I haven't done one of those in a long, long time."
"10148680","10150020"," Starting to squeeze higher now."
"10153090","10158930"," Now breaking through 386.19. See if we can get up into the higher reaches. "
"10158930","10209380"," Look at you guys, this upper bound is 387.80. 387 "
"10209380","10223030",".77. So"
"10223030","10226950"," 387.77 as an upper bound price target."
"10257340","10293320"," Now trading 386.87.85. Made"
"10293320","10294840"," some fucking money today."
"10295120","10295320"," Whoo!"
"10301140","10308980"," These are just short covering. "
"10309300","10311100"," This is all this is short covering right now."
"10315220","10319260"," Take the money up here at 388 or 388."
"10326980","10327800"," Take the money. "
"10327980","10330020"," If you guys follow me in at the bottom here."
"10330440","10332340"," I just got fucking fat stacks."
"10332820","10334680"," Just got 300 fucking percent. "
"10335440","10336680"," Hello fucking ladies."
"10339500","10340560"," Take your money."
"10340780","10341900"," Either it goes up from here. "
"10342140","10345300"," I want you to take your money and then reload if it rolls over."
"10345940","10350720"," You can leave one or two runners on whatever, three runners, ten runners, hundred fucking runners."

"10404550","10406150"," Two of the fucking pin on both sides."
"10407870","10408950"," Right from 380. "
"10409230","10409250"," Right from 380."
"10409250","10410950"," You're going to have to fucking 388 to 387."
"10414130","10414630"," 3779. "
"10414750","10415510"," Fucking to the pin."
"10416070","10416890"," Fuck yeah."
"10420160","10421760"," That was right to the fucking pin. "
"10424370","10425270"," Yeah I'll show it."
"10425330","10426710"," It was right to the fucking pin."
"10427650","10429270"," Right to the fucking pin. "
"10431050","10431550"," 3779."
"10435130","10436650"," Fucking love all of you out there."
"10437410","10438730"," How the fuck you got?"
"10438870","10440330"," You guys missed this stream or what?"
"10440330","10442050"," This fucking shit's awesome. "
"10445270","10447090"," That was fucking gangster."
"10453620","10454740"," Fuck yeah, deep end."
"10455140","10456560"," Christian, do we shit Christian?"
"10457320","10464140"," Send me your phone number or some Christian so I can give you a shout brother. "
"10465440","10467260"," Give you a call one of these days or something."
"10468560","10469820"," That was fucking epic."
"10473910","10475950"," We're going to see if we can go higher here, okay?"
"10479900","10481840"," Let me load this up right now. "
"10496160","10497520"," Speak here and see this right here."
"10497760","10499080"," What do you guys understand this right here?"
"10499660","10499840"," Right?"
"10500440","10502200"," We're being let up which is good to see."
"10502700","10506280"," This resistance is up so I want to see you guys see a couple of things here. "
"10506980","10511160"," See down below where it shows up like 386 inches so those bounce."
"10511920","10516420"," There's still some resistance here at 388 but we are being let up here."
"10516420","10518500"," 389.50 or so. "
"10519100","10520860"," So we can squeeze up here, right?"
"10521000","10521860"," We can get up to 390."
"10522540","10525180"," See how these blue boxes and red boxes are coming up."
"10525640","10528400"," We can squeeze up and tag 390 into the bell here. "
"10529780","10532340"," If you wanted to get short, right?"
"10532540","10533180"," You're asking earlier."
"10533560","10534460"," If you're a bear, right?"
"10534660","10535400"," I told you fuck."
"10535600","10536180"," When did I tell you?"
"10536180","10536980"," What did I tell you at 380?"
"10537940","10539500"," I said close your fucking shorts. "
"10539920","10541280"," Close your fucking putts."
"10541960","10546260"," I told you wait 10 of day if you wanted to take another short."
"10546260","10547520"," We're put position. "
"10550120","10550760"," Right?"
"10554740","10556980"," So if you're a bear, I saved you all."
"10557100","10558560"," I saved your ass too."
"10559260","10560000"," Fucking bears. "
"10560900","10562980"," Fucking saving bear lives too."
"10563620","10565560"," God damnate saving bear lives."
"10569060","10570080"," This is good. "
"10571260","10573320"," I do love bears just as much love bulls."
"10573320","10576440"," So what are you looking at here, right?"
"10576920","10578540"," Probably looking at a tag of 390."
"10582650","10584090"," See us being let up to this. "
"10584230","10585430"," This is the same pivot."
"10586090","10588610"," If you're a bear, we talked about this earlier, right?"
"10589070","10591430"," You don't want to get in short until up in here at some point, right?"
"10592770","10593750"," Somewhere up in here."
"10593870","10595550"," You don't want to get to stay taken short here. "
"10595910","10599030"," You want to wait for this, then take this short, right?"
"10599290","10602370"," You don't want to be in short inputs here, right?"
"10602370","10604830"," Told you to wait for it a day in case you come flat up."
"10604850","10606050"," Everybody told you this, right?"
"10606510","10607690"," Slinky dink up in here."
"10608290","10611250"," Let's say you want to get this short up in here for a Monday. "
"10611590","10612510"," Yeah, I told you this."
"10613030","10614490"," It only put 1%, right?"
"10616230","10617570"," Still put 1%."
"10617970","10619250"," But you put it up in here. "
"10620030","10623310"," Put 1% on short into Monday, right?"
"10623730","10625190"," Told you that at some point next week."
"10625490","10628350"," Bears are going to have to defend 395.01, right?"
"10628670","10630130"," Bears are going to have to defend this up here."
"10630130","10632510"," Might not be Monday, might be Wednesday, Friday. "
"10632950","10634450"," But at some point, you could expect it."
"10634930","10635670"," This is resistance."
"10636290","10637070"," I want you to know that. "
"10637410","10639750"," No matter what you think for today, this is resistance."
"10640450","10641370"," Why do you know that?"
"10641530","10642510"," This is resistance here."
"10643010","10646650"," But if we get up here, if we even screwed it up here in the clothes, this is where you'd"
"10646650","10647670"," start to take another short. "
"10648170","10651630"," This is what the Bears wanted to be defending, is this area over here, okay?"
"10652350","10653650"," This is Beartown down below."
"10658810","10661890"," Trading up now to fucking 390, baby."
"10663230","10663690"," 390. "
"10664870","10667050"," Let's see if the bulls can take it even higher."
"10667290","10668030"," Can they get higher?"
"10669930","10672990"," Now looking at a price target of 391."
"10674930","10677670"," 391, so we'll put an upper bound up here. "
"10678110","10679770"," Just in case."
"10681250","10682350"," Hold on here."
"10686750","10687950"," We'll put an upper bound here. "
"10688070","10689350"," We'll change this S1."
"10690690","10692990"," We're going to make it 391, right?"
"10693750","10699520"," For today, we'll make this R1."
"10710500","10713640"," That support is now turned into resistance here. "
"10716780","10718300"," That pivot is gone, right?"
"10718580","10718980"," You see that?"
"10721750","10723130"," I just saved the Bears ass."
"10723370","10724130"," I can't believe that."
"10724430","10725030"," Fuckin' A."
"10725210","10726450"," What am I doing saving Bears asses?"
"10727370","10729950"," Take your money and run a 380 right on the fucking ticker. "
"10739890","10746850"," Okay, so let's talk about the plant, so before we close the day out here, this is the last thing."
"10746970","10752230"," You guys are looking for videos for people, almost every Friday I used to give you guys my outlook"
"10752230","10754130"," for next week, right?"
"10754650","10760070"," Almost always give you my outlook for next week, you got people out there making videos about this"
"10760070","10766390"," shit on Saturdays and Sundays, and you basically get that fucking video for me on Friday, when you"
"10766390","10769030"," can make an actionable trade, right?"
"10770010","10774790"," So what are you looking for heading into Monday, right?"
"10778500","10781120"," The bears want to defend this 390."
"10782560","10788140"," We can trade above it here, there's nothing staying we can't trade above it here, but the bears"
"10788140","10791320"," want to defend this, and why do they want to defend this?"
"10791740","10801000"," Because of our next price target down, that's 369, that's 367, literally into this bell, you could"
"10801000","10810620"," put out a put spread, expiring fucking Friday, down to fucking 369, it's probably going to fucking"
"10810620","10817580"," print a weekly put spread, you can even put that fucking put spread into the fucking bell, we could"
"10817580","10823760"," trade over the fuck up to 400, and that's shit by Friday more than likely is going to print, does"
"10823760","10825340"," that make sense to any of you out there?"
"10828340","10830380"," You want to take less risk on, right?"
"10830840","10835940"," Fuck it, you think we're going above 400 from here, you're a big ass fucking bitch in Camaro"
"10835940","10843380"," fucking bull, sure, put out a put spread that's kind of more in the money, make your put spread"
"10843380","10852240"," 390, right where we are coming up to, 390 to 380, and put more time on it, that'll account for"
"10852240","10855400"," some stupid nonsense like that, is that what bull's thing's going to happen?"
"10856440","10860420"," I don't fucking think so, I don't fucking think so. "
"10861700","10867020"," I don't fucking think by fucking FOMC minutes, you're going to have a chance, so what do you do?"
"10867540","10872040"," You do a put spread here that sells some more of the money with more time on it, if we"
"10872040","10877120"," trade it up here you get more aggressive and more aggressive and more aggressive, you're already"
"10877120","10881320"," out of bounds here, does that make sense if you're a bear?"
"10881800","10888220"," If you're a bull that's looking for positioning, I'm going to take a short here, it's at the bell,"
"10888500","10895140"," four o'clock to four fifteen, it's put spreads, more time on them, when do you get aggressive,"
"10895440","10899240"," let's say you put some put spread on here, what can you do from here if you're like, well, I"
"10899240","10904300"," still think of my book cap, you can do a strangle here with zero dates, you can do Monday, you"
"10904300","10913780"," can do a Monday zero dates, four o' one, you can do a Monday zero dates, hold on here, you"
"10913780","10924510"," can put put spreads on with a Monday strangle, four o' one, and down to fucking 370, that's"
"10924510","10929150"," what you can fucking do, and if I guarantee one of that shit's going to print, if not two of"
"10929150","10934530"," them are going to print, I'm almost going to guarantee the fucking put spreads are going to print"
"10934530","10939730"," at some point, don't ever fucking sell your spreads, you dime in hand those, you've either make"
"10939730","10949540"," money in the beginning or you dime in them to the end, so you guys, all you guys out"
"10949540","10955300"," there fucking pay, all you guys sit around on Sunday, and some asshole comes and tells you what you"
"10955300","10961300"," should have known on Friday before the bell, I'll fucking tell you, trains you can make before the"
"10961300","10971280"," bell, you still have this above here, top on"
"10971280","10979180"," Monday is 400, that's top, and even if you hit this top, what's the regime after it heading into"
"10979180","10988840"," Friday, down, what's the price target on Friday, 360,"
"10990350","11007880"," 360, that's fucking wild, that's some wild, that's shit right there, if"
"11007880","11017740"," you break above 400 here, right, you come up here, what's your game plan over here, I don't"
"11017740","11031400"," buy this bullshit here at all, I ain't fucking buying it, do"
"11031400","11037440"," I think we could do seven red straight weeks, I think that fucking, I fucking think that the, I"
"11037440","11046460"," think there are internal components of this market, internals of this market that are going to"
"11046460","11060990"," stall any, any relief rally that you see in sight from here, any,"
"11063440","11068020"," I don't think, I think when someone asks you that question, I think when someone says well, it's"
"11068020","11073960"," been seven weeks, we'll never do eight weeks, I think that they're, I don't think they understand"
"11073960","11079920"," the mechanics of the market, I think that when, I think when you look back, okay, what I'm going to"
"11079920","11088690"," do for you guys, why do you guys do me a fucking solid, okay, why do you guys do me"
"11088690","11098100"," a fucking solid, I want you to go back and I want you to watch, I want you to go"
"11098100","11104400"," back and I want you to watch that video that I posted this morning in App Captain's Alpha, the"
"11104400","11107680"," beginning is a bunch of fluff and the end is a bunch of flutch, well the first five minutes is"
"11107680","11116580"," a bunch of like selling shit, but watch that fucking video, because he talks about the mechanics of"
"11116580","11126120"," the last couple crashes, and what the market was composed of, I want you to watch that fucking"
"11126120","11131260"," video because you'll, then you'll then say, well I'm not going to ask about seven and eight weeks"
"11131260","11139640"," any longer, because our market's composed of that right now, that's how our market's composed right"
"11139640","11155360"," now, our market's set up for a crash, well"
"11155360","11160000"," I'll go, I've talked about it and I think twice today, I've posted a bunch of shit on the App"
"11160000","11169520"," Captain's Alpha, tomorrow 12 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, you'll have a thorough, comprehensive live"

"11183200","11190760"," what they're telling you what's happening in the background, and why any relief should be stifled,"
"11191500","11198260"," and why the crash will be front-ran, and it was front-ran today as well, so you saw the"
"11198260","11203600"," front-ran running today and you're going to see it become amplified as the days and weeks move"
"11203600","11215730"," forward, I'll post it again at the end of the day, hold on, I'm"
"11215730","11224010"," going to post two videos today on Ad Captain's Alpha, do yourself a fucking favor and watch those"
"11224010","11230790"," videos tonight so that you are prepared when you see me tomorrow morning, I want you to be, I want"

"11247330","11252390"," sucks, the beginning and end really sucks, but you sometimes you have to suffer through this shit,"
"11253250","11258850"," to get the meats, right, not the potatoes, but the meat of what's actually taking place in the"
"11258850","11263730"," market right now, and what we'll do is we'll talk about this stuff tomorrow in more depth and"
"11263730","11270270"," detail, these are facts about the market, and you can't deny them, there's just no, you can't,"
"11270290","11279110"," there's no, you can't deny them, unless you have a market participant that has the power to change"
"11279110","11289050"," what's been put into motion, that's IE, a Fedshare, it's Ukraine, it's something unknown, we're"
"11289050","11296350"," not only looking for 360 into June, but you have other market participants, including large banks,"
"11297270","11303030"," that are going to try to front run that, and when they do attempt to front run that, we tend"
"11303030","11308510"," to overshoot those targets, right, you kind of overdo it, does that make sense?"
"11309650","11316250"," So I really, if I'm an insider and I know we're going to 360, I will try to beat you"
"11316250","11322070"," to the punch, and in turn you try to beat me to the punch, down below, that race down below"
"11322070","11331550"," sometimes, not always, but we know about tail risk events, right, in that race down, you'll have a"
"11331550","11339470"," capitulation moment, further, if we've spent all this time down here, banks, don't try to tell me"
"11339470","11347730"," that a bank in you, the guy that's been trading fucking stonks for a year, know when bottom is, you"
"11347730","11352990"," might specifically, because you and I are hanging out, but trust me, these guys know what they're"
"11352990","11359150"," doing, they always want to own lower than you, don't you guys have to know that, right, there's"
"11359150","11368670"," always a moment, and every fucking stock in ETF, always, where they own lower than you do, that's"
"11368670","11376270"," their intent, to always be in before you and to sell before you, you'll never, ever, most of you,"
"11376410","11383270"," like 99% of you, will never be in when the bank gets in, and you'll never be out before"
"11383270","11394510"," the bank gets out, you'll almost always be one step behind them, don't"
"11394510","11400430"," worry, I'll post, I'm going to post both videos, tonight, on outcafinsalpha, we're coming into the"

"11425930","11436270",",380p for Monday, 75 cents, they cost right now, they're going to get cheaper, so"
"11436270","11446070"," what I would do is wait until 4, 15 ish, 410, 405, right around there, next 5, 10 minutes, right,"
"11446370","11452130"," and you got fucking, you got get sharks out there right now, and they're going to load the fucking"
