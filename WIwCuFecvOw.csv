"90630","91470"," What's going on everybody?"
"91970","92570"," Good morning."
"93390","94850"," I hope everybody's doing well."
"100420","101020"," Good morning. "
"101240","101620"," Good morning."
"103220","110940"," Joey Clapton, John Alexander, Faison, Jafar, Corey, Dan, Zach, Blind Nestle, Johnny Five, how are"
"110940","112640"," you doing Marcus, Wikiface, what up brother?"
"113260","114080"," How are you doing this morning?"
"117700","121320"," I like it when he comes that way because he gives me a couple hours doing my actual job."
"123500","127199"," Keisha Clapton, Quentin, or Quantum, Dustin, good morning. "
"127419","128500"," Yeah, I'm late this morning again."
"128960","131420"," I got a bunch of shit in the background I'm doing here now."
"131520","135180"," I got a bunch of stuff related to the channel going on in the background. "
"135980","138040"," I was actually even up late last night."
"138280","143980"," I was working until midnight or one o'clock in the morning and then again this morning when I woke"
"143980","144200"," up."
"144420","146000"," So it just never, it never fucking ends. "
"147280","148920"," So it's kind of hard to get on this morning."
"149360","150820"," It's a long day to be streaming."
"151180","153260"," So we got some stuff to talk about this morning. "
"153660","158120"," We're going to flip right over real quick and just cut this bullshit out."
"160500","163680"," And it's kind of a kind of a light trading day right now."
"165240","167320"," That can be good for bulls to an extent. "
"169440","172480"," Take a look at some support levels, some resistance levels this morning."
"172480","175920"," We're going to talk about what to expect in the next today and tomorrow."
"176580","178660"," To some extent, I loved it. "
"178760","180180"," We touched down and we blast off."
"181500","183260"," Can we trade higher the higher this morning?"
"183520","184120"," Sure, it's possible."
"184740","185600"," We can trade up here. "
"186320","187640"," We can trade before 18, 420."
"188620","189960"," But to escape this, right?"
"191080","192980"," There's two things that have not happened."
"194020","194660"," Two. "
"195640","198520"," Today is not an OPEC's day."
"199720","209000"," So you need not only the fuel of expiring puts, you need bulls to jump on board with you."
"209180","211780"," You need market participants to jump on board with you. "
"212340","215140"," Banks, hedge funds, whoever."
"216380","219980"," Now those banks might might know what's going to happen in the Fed meeting."
"220280","226000"," It doesn't appear that they know for sure what's going to happen in this FOMC meeting. "
"226140","227180"," There's still some derision."
"228400","230340"," We'll get into that this morning at some point."
"232020","237700"," There's some calculating saying that it's going to be a bullish FOMC, believe it or not, even from"
"237700","237940"," bears. "
"239520","245100"," Especially if you have other markets, currency markets, mortgage markets."
"245640","246880"," I'm going to stop there."
"247080","249540"," We'll get the Joel's job openings from March expected. "
"250260","253960"," 11.2 million, pyros 11.27 million."
"253960","261760"," We'll get March factor orders expected 1.2%, pyros 1 and 0.5%. And with the factor orders, we'll"
"261760","267820"," get the March final thermal goods orders data expected 0.8%, which would be in line with the"
"267820","268260"," preliminary."
"271550","274590"," The commodities markets believe it or not, it's all wrapped up in this. "
"274730","277790"," We get all kinds of markets, especially under the surface."
"278670","283610"," If you have the wheels that take you someplace, let's say that's the equity market, while the"
"283610","289590"," engine, the inside of our markets, have some real fucking problems going on in it within it."
"289910","292510"," That can't impact 2T, believe it or not. "
"293310","298010"," Now, with all that said, we need to escape velocity."
"298310","300170"," We're not going to get it today for two reasons."
"300170","302590"," The first one is today's not a no-pex day. "
"303150","309530"," You need the kick from puts expiring for that escape velocity."
"309970","310670"," Everyone knows it."
"312090","313430"," Everyone knew it yesterday. "
"313970","314530"," We knew it yesterday."
"314730","321070"," We said, eventually at some point today, I don't care when I want to be in when these shorts close"
"321070","323770"," and these puts expire."
"324790","327490"," I don't know when it's going to happen, but I know it's going to happen. "
"328330","331910"," Now, today we can easily trade up here, trade up here at 420, whatever."
"332190","335570"," I don't know that we have the escape velocity for two reasons."
"336550","337590"," It's not a no-pex day. "
"338030","343150"," There's a high chance, a good chance that nobody's going to close their puts today for one day away"
"343150","344350"," from the FOMC meeting."
"344510","350970"," There's no reason to close puts that are expiring on Wednesday, four on Friday today."
"352110","355210"," So, what's the benefit of going along here?"
"356450","357170"," I don't know. "
"357310","362710"," You can go from 4.13 to 4.24.18. That's the benefit."
"364070","370370"," If we trade up here, there's a fair chance we're going to roll it over today or even tomorrow into"
"370370","376210"," the FOMC meeting or not the FOMC meeting, but the FOMC statement."
"377290","382350"," So, there's a chance there's a trap in here for bulls and we're going to trade lower once more more"
"382350","382570"," time. "
"382570","385690"," This is even anticipating some good news."
"388140","395300"," There is another concern here and the other concern is, especially as a bull, is there any bad"
"395300","395620"," news?"
"396560","401260"," Is there something, is there like a sacrificial lamb that is the equity market?"
"401920","406000"," And that's one more positive that's been out there for about a week or two now, would be that you'd"
"406000","412220"," sacrifice the equities market even in this FOMC."
"413440","417640"," You would sacrifice the equities market to save the credit market. "
"419360","426400"," It's interesting too that this is very complicated to some extent too because you can, some of the"
"426400","431840"," posits are, we have QT taking place right now, believe it or not, whether you know it or not."
"432260","435360"," And so, we're not just QT, but we have taxation going on in the background."
"436380","442620"," And then couple that with raising rates and then wanting to roll out QT. "
"444260","448960"," They actually can't, some of the markets are saying, hey, if you do that to us, we're going to have"
"448960","450200"," a fucking Black Swan event."
"451720","452960"," So, what are you doing that situation?"
"453640","461940"," There's another argument to be said that if they had a choice of which market they're going to"
"461940","463440"," save, which is it going to be?"
"464560","466580"," And it's not the equity market."
"467640","471640"," That actually makes more probable sense to me then. "
"472280","477640"," I'm kind of bullish on the FOMC, but if there was a market to save, they would all day long"
"477640","478900"," sacrifice the equity market."
"481130","484830"," Now, the minutes do count more because that's where they whisper that kind of information."
"484830","488170"," Most of that stuff comes out later on the minutes, FOMC minutes. "
"488930","495430"," Just a minute to the data, Joel's shop openings from our expected 1.2 million, durable goods order,"
"495650","501030"," seen 0.8% factor orders, seen 1.2%. There's light trading this morning as well."
"501570","504290"," People are sitting on their hands this morning."
"506520","508980"," So, just keep that in mind as we trade today. "
"509160","511220"," Keep that in mind as we trade, if we trade up today."
"511900","513320"," Keep that in mind if we start to trade higher."
"513640","515280"," 420 is not that far away. "
"516280","518880"," This right here looks slightly trappy to me."
"519299","524500"," Look at the March of Joel's data, the factor orders and durable goods orders, final reading in just"
"524500","524980"," a few seconds."
"526040","527860"," You can blast this up, right?"
"528460","530960"," And then you have to be out of here by like 418, 420. "
"531260","534920"," We'll take a quick look real quick and just see where resistance is above."
"535920","537140"," Light trading this morning."
"539400","547300"," 11.55 million for Joel's shop openings above the 11.2 million expected, factor orders 2.2% above"
"547300","553340"," the 1.2% expectation, durable goods at 1.1% is 3.10s higher than the preliminary X transportation. "
"554180","559300"," 1.4% is 3.10s higher than expected, capital goods orders 1.3% is up 3.10s from"
"559300","563720"," the pre-lend, and capital goods shipments at 0.4% is up 2.10s from the pre-lend."
"563720","569700"," The prior Joel's file is higher to 11.3 million from the 11.2% to 7 million."
"578760","580920"," Week sellers above up here at 420. "
"583760","585920"," You can see them up here at 418, right?"
"586100","587140"," This is where the sellers are."
"588240","590500"," Same as yesterday, 418 or so."
"592740","595240"," Joel's data for March appears to be another record, huh?"
"597510","604580"," It's a 418 being the first resistance point, and then the second resistance point being the same at"
"604580","604920"," 420. "
"605460","609040"," This was here yesterday at 418 resistance point."
"638440","643120"," We'll mark in this 418 and put this 418 in here."
"653340","656740"," Let's take a closer look, and the volatility begins. "
"657620","658060"," Come in here."
"661150","661670"," Hold on here."
"664500","665560"," You can find this vol. "
"680340","686100"," 416.54. 416.97. It goes all out to 18."
"687200","688920"," It's the first rejection point."
"689220","693080"," You break through 416.64 or so. "
"711980","712880"," Right in here."
"714560","719180"," You need to get through this zone right here to hit the price target 420."
"729820","731920"," Volatility trigger is above. "
"732340","733140"," It's at 440."
"734840","735740"," Excuse me, 420."
"751260","753060"," Price target, we're talking about 450. "
"754060","757940"," I don't know why we were up at 460."
"758180","759460"," I said 450 yesterday."
"766360","769040"," We'll move these over as time goes forward. "
"808910","809950"," Price target, 440."
"810570","811750"," Price target extension, 450."
"813030","816070"," I'm going to give this one an overtime if we don't roll it right over. "
"819630","821030"," Volatility triggers at 420."
"822130","831730"," The first area of resistance right up here, 416, 418 is"
"831730","832930"," somewhere in here."
"833070","835750"," There's going to be some light resistance, some sellers. "
"836450","837590"," I'll write sellers in here."
"844490","844890"," Deberes."
"862260","867920"," The positive is going to be, or my take or positive here. "
"867920","875460"," I was weird because I saw someone on Twitter say something like, there's clear skies above 420 to"
"875460","875680"," 430."
"876180","877720"," And I was like, no, that's not fucking true."
"879000","886140"," There's giant, giant resistance here that needs a reason for it to go away. "
"890090","891690"," This is the area."
"891890","893190"," This is like the escape velocity."
"893350","898410"," If you don't break 420, there's a fair chance to come up here and roll it right back down. "
"898410","900630"," And you really need some fuel."
"900890","905330"," You need the FMC to go away."
"905590","906950"," You need puts to roll off. "
"907810","913730"," Now typically on the day of FMC, you would have your OPECs on the same day."
"914390","915890"," And that's not the case for today."
"915970","916950"," It's tomorrow on Wednesday. "
"918110","923870"," So I'm going to expect any kind of a rally here today or push today to be muted."
"924770","929210"," I'm going to expect it to be somewhere between 418 and 420."
"929770","931990"," Now we talked about the yesterday heading into the close. "
"942460","943320"," Just a second here."
"954980","961650"," We also know that the FMC meeting, right, it was today, of course."
"961870","963950"," It was actually started yesterday, I think, to an extent. "
"965210","968410"," But the FMC meeting today meeting is the third and fourth, the official meeting."
"969450","971710"," And on the fourth at 2 p.m. is the presser."
"975250","976390"," And that this is key. "
"979740","980840"," That it's on Wednesday."
"981240","982000"," It's not on Tuesday."
"982360","982960"," It's on Wednesday. "
"983120","990390"," It's at 2 p.m. And it also lines up with OPEC's tomorrow."
"990750","991770"," So we have OPEC's tomorrow."
"992170","998970"," We have put protection, protective put, protective shorts on the market heading into FMC. "
"999950","1005270"," So we have all the ingredients for a blast off, but it's not on Tuesday."
"1005850","1006470"," It's on Wednesday."
"1009220","1011380"," So my positive was this morning. "
"1011580","1013040"," It's a better day to not trade."
"1013760","1016440"," My positive to people today and tomorrow."
"1016740","1020740"," Today specifically, unless there's a break of some kind of news, we don't know. "
"1021540","1027720"," In case there's any kind of, we can get rid of this now."
"1028380","1036720"," We already know that 405 was the touchy, right?"
"1037020","1037980"," We got back down on the day here."
"1041079","1043400"," The dotted line was 405. "
"1044140","1045440"," We're going to get rid of that."
"1048330","1049970"," We got the pin strike yesterday."
"1064630","1065550"," Kind of works, right?"
"1065790","1066850"," 405.02. That kind of works. "
"1074210","1075570"," You get S3 down here."
"1075630","1076770"," We can move these over for you."
"1077050","1077810"," There's S3 400. "
"1079690","1080570"," S2 is still there."
"1080990","1081210"," 405."
"1081730","1082450"," It has nothing to change. "
"1084470","1085970"," S1 is 410 today."
"1089260","1090320"," Talk about this on Friday, right?"
"1094140","1094620"," R1."
"1097480","1098520"," We'll check it on this. "
"1098640","1102680"," This was actually 415, but it moves around every day."
"1105240","1106200"," So we'll take a look at it."
"1106280","1108200"," We'll take a look at it specifically today. "
"1109660","1110820"," This is R2 right here."
"1115120","1116680"," Trading range down here, right?"
"1116920","1118340"," You buy these dips down here."
"1118520","1120720"," S1, S2 at 405, S3. "
"1121020","1121480"," Buy all this."
"1122340","1129380"," And you sell all this until you, until we remove the ferry."
"1144290","1146090"," You can kind of see that in here, right?"
"1146230","1147450"," You can kind of see it at a peak here. "
"1147550","1148370"," You're going to peak here."
"1148610","1150370"," We're starting to get another peak in here."
"1151530","1153430"," And the question comes, do you buy this?"
"1153590","1154210"," Do you buy this?"
"1154410","1155030"," Do you buy this?"
"1155210","1155430"," No. "
"1155790","1156370"," Do you buy this?"
"1156550","1156750"," Yes."
"1157050","1157610"," Do you buy this?"
"1159610","1159770"," Yes."
"1166590","1167970"," Price target made for it. "
"1168150","1169930"," So what are we looking for today and tomorrow?"
"1171890","1172270"," Me."
"1175230","1176570"," I'm looking for something in here."
"1179040","1179840"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"1179840","1184180"," I think Winky said he was looking for something like our subdued."
"1184980","1188260"," Or Winky was saying, if it was good news, you might get this and then subdued."
"1188560","1189940"," Your real rocket ship is on Friday. "
"1191340","1200180"," And with that said, anything down here, if you're bullish, anything down in here, if you're"
"1200180","1206700"," bullish, you're probably at a point in the market where you could buy a call spread."
"1206700","1214320"," If you're doing that captain's trade, just buy yourself a call spread that is, I don't know, month"
"1214320","1218220"," out, I would price target 440."
"1220960","1228140"," I'd bet down around for, I'd bet down around, if we get back down around 405 or 400 or something,"
"1228260","1230140"," you place the call spread that was not that wide. "
"1230620","1235660"," I'd make it like 435 or something to 438."
"1237800","1241460"," I'd be like 430 to 438 or something there."
"1241720","1244100"," Small spread on it, nice and high. "
"1244960","1246500"," I bet that prints like 300%."
"1246500","1250140"," If we get down here again, if we get down into these lower bonds."
"1251140","1252340"," Now with all that said, right?"
"1256760","1265970"," With all that said, I think the last six or seven FOMC meetings have been trading those since last"
"1265970","1266350"," year. "
"1266350","1268650"," A lot of people on Twitter know that I trade those."
"1269110","1270170"," You can go through my history."
"1270350","1271290"," I don't delete a lot of my tweets. "
"1271490","1277150"," Most of my tweets I delete are either sensitive or I've offended somebody, but most of them I leave"
"1277150","1284490"," up, like 99.9%. So if you go back and just check even around FOMC meetings, how I typically trade"
"1284490","1294200"," them is I wait until the OPEC state and I wait until the minute."
"1296380","1300700"," I keep an eye on if anything leaks or breaks."
"1300980","1304860"," There'll be moments you'll see where we might trade sideways here. "
"1308020","1313840"," Let's say before the presser you might see a huge dip."
"1314680","1316000"," Then I'll give you a great buy-in."
"1318160","1323560"," Sometimes you'll see before the presser, you'll see a quick spike and then a drop. "
"1324960","1328840"," One of the neat parts of this is the out when it happens."
"1329060","1329440"," It changes."
"1329680","1330700"," The time of day changes. "
"1331680","1335380"," It's not all it used to be like half an hour an hour before, but then people started catching on."
"1337140","1340780"," So like the first like I think three or four times I did this."
"1341820","1344240"," Like the first at least few nobody knew about it. "
"1344440","1346000"," And then people started catching on, right?"
"1346000","1352420"," And so there was an FOMC meeting three or four months ago or something."
"1354330","1364270"," My take was that what I was using as a measure was that everybody"
"1364270","1367590"," was input into FOMC meeting."
"1368250","1368750"," Everybody. "
"1369270","1370750"," I'm talking like everybody."
"1372490","1374210"," So of course I took the contrary trade."
"1374730","1376510"," I'm actually known for those kind of trades, right?"
"1376730","1377190"," Took that trade. "
"1377450","1380510"," And then one FOMC meeting, everybody was in fucking calls."
"1382820","1386080"," So I took the opposite side and it fucking sold off."
"1386800","1390440"," It came back, but it sold off just after the FOMC meeting. "
"1390580","1394640"," And I think that was mostly because everybody was loaded to the tips on calls."
"1394940","1397300"," Everybody and everybody knew was going to happen."
"1398780","1401100"," So that is one concern heading into tomorrow. "
"1401620","1407200"," So I'm going to keep my eye tomorrow on the open and see where everybody is positioned."
"1408060","1413460"," If everybody is positioned on the call side, sometimes you'll see a dip before you see that rip."
"1414620","1415860"," They'll burn all those calls. "
"1417700","1419100"," They'll just fucking torch them."
"1419960","1424520"," They'll let you all load up on them and you're like, oh, I'm in for 50 cents or 60 cents"
"1424520","1426520"," or whatever it is you're in for whatever strike."
"1428000","1433040"," Then before you know it, they're down to like 10 cents or three cents and you're self-doubting"
"1433040","1437500"," wondering if you're going to triple down so you can actually make that rocket ship a day or two"
"1437500","1437720"," later. "
"1437980","1438800"," So just keep that in place."
"1439000","1442780"," That's another chance of what might happen."
"1444540","1447520"," Another idea that might happen would be that we just blast off today, right?"
"1447640","1448740"," They go, fuck you, we're out of here. "
"1449040","1449140"," Right?"
"1449320","1450300"," That's why I saw that on Twitter."
"1450460","1451140"," Everyone was like, fuck it."
"1451200","1451580"," We're out of here. "
"1452140","1453160"," Fuck out of FOMC."
"1453320","1453800"," It doesn't matter."
"1453800","1455340"," I will warn you if that happens. "
"1458290","1460210"," You roll an FOMC mean, right?"
"1462230","1464450"," You roll an FOMC meaning, right?"
"1464570","1467490"," And you're like, right in the face of the fed and you're like, fuck you, we're out of here?"
"1468850","1472970"," Before you even get to FOMC mean, they're probably going to, he's probably going to change his"
"1472970","1475710"," speech and fucking slam this market right down on your face."
"1476570","1479310"," I mean, you think people won't do that shit, but they will."
"1480030","1481150"," He would be surprised. "
"1483530","1484930"," He'll do it just to fuck you."
"1486450","1489090"," So I think the bank's the hedge funds or whatever."
"1489310","1492870"," I think to an extent you're going to see some muted trading today. "
"1494490","1495210"," That's what I think."
"1497830","1499350"," I don't think that you get the ripper."
"1499810","1501610"," I don't think you get bloodbath either. "
"1501810","1504410"," I think this is where the market just waits."
"1505150","1506570"," That's the FOMC mean, do its thing."
"1506570","1512870"," They prop big banks and big interest probably has feelers out there trying to find out information"
"1513490","1514670"," in the meeting, right?"
"1514870","1517870"," Get people in the hallways waiting around, that kind of stuff. "
"1519290","1525490"," So if you wanted a recommendation, I don't like giving them, but for me, right, what I'm going to"
"1525490","1533310"," do is I'm going to probably hang out today, chill out, not do too much, and watch the market move."
"1533310","1537510"," It's not a bad thing to be a reactive trader."
"1540650","1547210"," An example would be if we trade down like this, right, to look for a chance to about go long. "
"1549510","1552290"," If we trade up like crazy, right?"
"1555680","1560920"," You guys remember when I was on Twitter back here, and I said to you, take your money and run."
"1562320","1564620"," If you want to leave some on for this, you can."
"1565800","1569920"," Remember what I was like, this was the move right here, right?"
"1570120","1570880"," This was the move. "
"1571900","1573280"," You can do some FOMO up here."
"1573420","1575440"," You can put some risk on all that money you made, right?"
"1575720","1576740"," You don't want to do that crazy shit."
"1576880","1580360"," You're not going to be like 100% balls deep and then stay balls deep. "
"1581860","1582740"," Take your money and run."
"1583280","1585280"," You start to see it selling off over here."
"1585880","1587960"," You can throw some money in there, right?"
"1588680","1590620"," And the same thing kind of applies here. "
"1590760","1593940"," If you made all this money yesterday and you want to leave some on for a trip higher, sure."
"1594840","1598120"," I think throw some nickels and dimes at it or something, do it."
"1598540","1603200"," The reality is if you're a bull, reality is if you're a bull, I'll tell you what you're looking for"
"1603200","1603760"," to take along. "
"1606290","1610530"," You're waiting for this vol trigger to move higher."
"1611170","1615070"," So you're going to buy this vol trigger once it's confirmed that you're going higher."
"1615610","1619250"," Resistance becomes support, and then you'll take that trade higher. "
"1619250","1621050"," All this fucking shit in here is nonsense."
"1622510","1623550"," No need for it."
"1625170","1627610"," Now, if you get up here and we can take this long, we will. "
"1628470","1631130"," We're here, we're ready, we'll take this long, right?"
"1631610","1633710"," We'll miss this, we'll miss this right here."
"1634030","1635810"," Two fucking bad, right?"
"1636010","1641070"," Now, if it doesn't go up here, and we do roll over, when we're looking for places to take along."
"1642310","1644190"," I think I commented yesterday, I said I hope. "
"1645310","1646430"," I wasn't really hoping."
"1647090","1648690"," This is my, this is my positive."
"1650350","1651610"," I say things like that. "
"1651730","1652470"," I hope this happens."
"1652870","1659870"," The reality is that I think that between today and tomorrow, there's probably another chance to buy"
"1659870","1665910"," a dip at least at 410, and most probable at 400."
"1666670","1667790"," It's not most probable, excuse me. "
"1668190","1671070"," Most probable you'll have a dip at 410 at some point between today and tomorrow."
"1672130","1673990"," And there's a small chance."
"1673990","1676030"," I'll give this one like 30% chance. "
"1678050","1679570"," I'm gonna give this one 10%."
"1679570","1680690"," It's 10% chance."
"1680910","1681430"," Oh, it's 15. "
"1682950","1684170"," I'll give this one over here."
"1688150","1689230"," I'm fucking that up."
"1689390","1690710"," Let's give this one like a 10% chance. "
"1691210","1691450"," Yeah."
"1692030","1694230"," Yeah, there's 10%."
"1695570","1696450"," It's 20%. "
"1698590","1699470"," It's 30%."
"1700870","1701870"," We got there."
"1702110","1702850"," We have 40. "
"1703490","1704950"," We got 60% chance, right?"
"1707030","1711890"," Probably have a 20% chance of us beating this today."
"1713390","1717770"," Then you probably got a 20% chance that we're gonna fucking sell down below 400."
"1719190","1723470"," I'm not giving anything to us trading higher than 420. "
"1724730","1725370"," Zero."
"1726370","1727690"," I'll give you 5%."
"1728410","1730330"," So now we're going to 105%. "
"1730330","1732490"," I feel like a 5% chance that we trade over this."
"1733810","1734730"," Great fucking now."
"1737050","1738230"," I'm honest with you, I like that. "
"1738870","1739770"," Very small chance."
"1740210","1743550"," We have as much chance trading up here as we do is trading below here."
"1744490","1744810"," Small. "
"1748340","1748740"," Gambling."
"1750000","1752280"," And so if those chances are low, what does that mean?"
"1752440","1755120"," It means that I'm not willing to take this trade until we get up here."
"1755120","1762920"," It also means I'm not willing to short below 400 unless we break through and start trading lower,"
"1763080","1763400"," right?"
"1764740","1765180"," Why?"
"1765880","1768100"," Because these are outside of our implied moves. "
"1769460","1772880"," So I'm going to want to wait to confirm this move and that move."
"1772980","1775080"," I'm not going to be buying this stupid shit right now."
"1776720","1780840"," If I miss this trade right here, if I miss this trade right and y'all getting up here today,"
"1780840","1781620"," I'm fine with that. "
"1781740","1782360"," I don't need that money."
"1783540","1784640"," I don't fucking need it."
"1787770","1789330"," But I do need this down here. "
"1789470","1790890"," If I get some down here, we go up there."
"1791010","1793050"," I'm going to do that down there and love that."
"1793830","1795070"," Something like that, I love that. "
"1796630","1797550"," So just have patience."
"1801620","1803840"," Have some patience as we roll into today."
"1804000","1805760"," Have some patience as we roll into tomorrow. "
"1808460","1809300"," Especially as a bull."
"1809620","1810580"," I'm going to tell you something else."
"1810720","1815360"," If you're a bull out there and you want to take this long, patience. "
"1816520","1818580"," Just have some patience, right?"
"1819380","1820740"," Just have some patience."
"1823040","1829020"," If you don't need the entire move up, you only need to have some confirmation and then you catch"
"1829020","1829840"," the rest of that break."
"1831640","1835400"," People that get burned to get burned down here and they get burned up here. "
"1836380","1838960"," This part of the move is the sexiest part of it."
"1839760","1841280"," This is the sexy part of that move."
"1843140","1845540"," We haven't seen a view shape that recovery yet as well. "
"1846180","1847760"," We saw short covering yesterday."
"1850360","1854160"," Yesterday we saw this right here was I've taken the money and run it."
"1855860","1858020"," These are the people that said I made all this money here. "
"1858240","1858540"," I'm good."
"1858700","1860600"," Does that make sense?"
"1861440","1864600"," I'm going to reset now and see if we can push it lower."
"1866000","1867260"," We test down below here. "
"1867380","1868680"," We test this low once more."
"1869120","1869920"," We test 405."
"1870560","1872140"," See if we get a breakthrough there. "
"1873560","1876740"," My take on this is not what some of Twitter's is."
"1877720","1878440"," Especially bulls."
"1878740","1879500"," I'm a fucking bull. "
"1880200","1882600"," You guys hear me bitch about bears all the time."
"1883400","1886700"," You hear me bitch about bulls buying tops all the time."
"1888000","1890640"," I think this move right here, you have some patience. "
"1893930","1896070"," You have this move right here."
"1896570","1897590"," We knew this was here."
"1897770","1899970"," This yellow line, we talked about this yellow line yesterday. "
"1900990","1902350"," I had this yellow line."
"1902410","1903110"," I talked to you yesterday."
"1903530","1905030"," You guys can go back and just watch them right. "
"1905130","1906490"," I said, you're going to come up here."
"1906550","1909910"," There's a fair chance we're going to come up here and bounce off in after hours or the overnight."
"1910330","1910990"," We did. "
"1911910","1912570"," We did."
"1914110","1915350"," We bounced off, right?"
"1915730","1916930"," We'll find more support, right?"
"1917430","1919070"," There are back at this resistance again."
"1919650","1921130"," And there's still resistance above. "
"1921730","1926870"," So there's a fair chance that you're going to encounter this resistance then look for new support."
"1927310","1929670"," Need new buyers to come in."
"1929670","1931330"," You need these kind of buyers. "
"1932210","1935610"," And you need an event to end for the market to go up."
"1937730","1939870"," That's kind of where I'm at right now at the market."
"1941050","1944490"," I will wait until we confirm that we're going higher. "
"1945930","1946550"," And I like to wait."
"1946790","1956390"," This year, this FOMC meeting, Jerome Powell was pretty fucking harkish in the"
"1956390","1959210"," World Economic Summit or something like that."
"1960190","1961070"," Or bearish. "
"1961210","1965410"," If I'm off, I said bullish, but he's pretty fucking bearish in that Economic Summit."
"1965670","1967290"," He comes out and says some shit like that."
"1968250","1970610"," I'm telling you, he comes out and says anything like that. "
"1971490","1971930"," Anything."
"1972790","1974410"," The market's going to fucking burn."
"1974850","1979170"," And I don't mean it's going to burn at 380 or 360, but that shit will burn down to four. "
"1981050","1982850"," I guarantee it'll burn down to four."
"1983750","1986210"," And that might be where the dip buy is."
"1987110","1987550"," Right. "
"1987630","1991230"," Just that little push down where you can get in that get nasty."
"1993570","1995690"," We had full market liquidation yesterday."
"1996050","1997250"," We routed XLP. "
"1997550","2003610"," Some people were talking on Twitter saying, well, if we give up XLP, then that implies we're in a"
"2003610","2004090"," bear market."
"2004810","2006030"," I'm like, that's bullshit."
"2006930","2008250"," We do that all the time. "
"2009110","2013290"," You just happen to sell one of your clients that XLP is not going to get fucked up."
"2014390","2016870"," So their clients were in XLP and it got fucked up."
"2017210","2017670"," It's normal. "
"2018050","2018310"," It's normal."
"2018490","2023190"," It's a normal part of this market to bleed out even XLP and XLU."
"2023550","2031990"," The two are the last to go for the last leg or so of the capitulations in the markets. "
"2032730","2036390"," This even happened in the bull market where we're going up."
"2036970","2039370"," You would see XLU and XLP give it up for a day or two."
"2040230","2042470"," So I heard that shake yesterday too and I was like, yeah, whatever. "
"2044070","2046630"," Now, are we in a bear market for the rest of the year?"
"2046870","2047830"," It would be the next question."
"2047969","2055300"," We'll talk about that here in a few minutes and see we're trading sideways still, right?"
"2055679","2059940"," A little bit more buyers in the market than sellers right now getting a little more action as the"
"2059940","2061219"," morning wears on here."
"2065110","2069530"," Some decent resistance above here at 415-44 and again at 416-26. "
"2072150","2075610"," Sellers are just waiting above here right there at 417 here in 418."
"2076210","2078690"," Just waiting to come on in and start selling this market."
"2079050","2084650"," There's, I'm sure, our begging and hoping that we get up to 418-420 so they can throw some shorts"
"2084650","2084949"," on. "
"2085730","2086670"," They're begging for it."
"2088580","2089760"," Promise, they're begging for it."
"2089900","2093540"," They're begging for us to trade up there so they can short this down into FOMC. "
"2099920","2101000"," See, I have 40 points."
"2101220","2102160"," I don't need this 40 points."
"2102420","2103440"," You can have that 40 points. "
"2105020","2106040"," I don't need it."
"2107760","2110640"," You can also see too, there's not a key point in here, right?"
"2115700","2121530"," There's not a key point in here and that is, I mean, this is a nice basing and this is"
"2121530","2122350"," nice basing too."
"2122430","2124110"," See this basing how beautiful this looks?"
"2126610","2128350"," I like seeing that right there. "
"2128630","2129450"," This is bullish, man."
"2129630","2130410"," It's just moving."
"2132070","2133390"," See this basing right here?"
"2133390","2135070"," Comes up, reverses straight down. "
"2136870","2138310"," False breakout right here."
"2138710","2139630"," Boom, pushes up."
"2140570","2140690"," Down. "
"2141730","2142030"," Trapped."
"2145710","2148130"," The huge, bullish, dish."
"2148850","2149110"," Move up. "
"2149890","2150130"," Face."
"2151270","2151610"," Slam it up."
"2152150","2152510"," Take the money. "
"2152890","2152970"," Run."
"2153430","2153910"," Roll it over."
"2178670","2179630"," You're just thinking here. "
"2181270","2182730"," Try to load some stuff in the background."
"2187870","2193970"," A sustained likelihood is unlikely to occur until 54th FMC due to this volatility."
"2194630","2196330"," Large puts doesn't likely be meaningfully sold. "
"2196710","2198090"," This prevents an extended rise in equities."
"2198190","2200830"," A break of 4,200 invokes our lower bound concept."
"2201990","2203410"," Valid until 54th. "

"2225230","2226930"," Spy equivalent to 420."
"2227890","2229370"," With 42050 above there. "
"2229770","2234110"," Support shows at 410 or 4110 in 410."
"2235190","2237430"," Following that key support is 4051."
"2238110","2243070"," Here's what's quite a wild session with SPX declining 1.8% introduced. "
"2243870","2245630"," Only to stop tipping me."
"2246450","2247150"," Okay, good job."
"2247390","2247850"," You can subscribe. "
"2249950","2251030"," Someone didn't tip."
"2251190","2251730"," They just subscribed."
"2252010","2252870"," Do not tip me today. "
"2253510","2256650"," I'm trying to switch over the tipping stuff."
"2257830","2260550"," We're getting fucked over by PayPal right now."
"2260910","2263130"," They don't want to switch to one of their other companies. "
"2264150","2266290"," Someone have to issue some refunds and stuff like that."
"2266290","2270570"," They don't have to, but they do weird shit."
"2270790","2275130"," They'll give you the money in like six months or 18 months. "
"2275890","2279350"," Or they literally keep it and shut your account down and never pay it to you."
"2279510","2284330"," Never refund it either because their refund rules are a very short window."
"2285250","2286050"," Don't tip me. "
"2287110","2288810"," Futures are at 4150 overnight."
"2289310","2294150"," Our volatility estimates remain in line with the last several days at 1.2% resistance."
"2294930","2296110"," Yes, it was quite a wild session. "
"2296490","2298870"," SPX declining 1.8% in today."
"2299030","2305170"," Only to rally 2.2% into the final hour and closing higher at 41.55. This rally was driven"
"2305170","2309710"," by short covering in in a liquid market key words."
"2310950","2312150"," These are key words. "
"2315280","2321580"," Regardless of trigger triggers just matter more in these high IV negative gamma markets."
"2322160","2327560"," As such, a decline retest of 410 is just as likely as a test of 420."
"2328680","2333220"," Note though that everything we outlined yesterday, lower bond mechanics, 4050 support is still in"
"2333220","2333460"," place. "
"2333780","2341960"," Again, we highlight that big IV sellers are not going to step out today"
"2341960","2344960"," due to today's FMC."
"2345540","2354360"," And this limits a sustained rally to the same point."
"2354360","2357000"," We've noticed that the buying today is light, right?"
"2358220","2361540"," Thus, a true directional move is not likely until tomorrow. "
"2361900","2363800"," Doesn't mean we don't do it through the traditional move today."
"2364260","2365400"," Just says that it's not likely."
"2368020","2373220"," While we are assigning an edge to market rally out of FMC, market edge. "
"2375430","2377450"," This situation is different from March below."
"2377650","2383430"," We've plotted short dated IV for cues and you can see that we're in a backward dated fear state."
"2384170","2385790"," Short dated purple dots. "
"2387590","2392210"," Right as the IV is greater than slightly longer dated yellow."
"2394770","2396990"," IV is currently above year to date height."
"2397870","2400850"," Our highs, which makes sense given fresh QQQ lows. "
"2401290","2406550"," We've marked with a star roughly where the market was in March FOMC down here."
"2409820","2413080"," And we had discussed the same lower bond mechanics into that event, right?"
"2413240","2414860"," You can see where we are right now, right?"
"2415700","2416020"," Even lower."
"2420550","2426730"," What's different here is that there is not a large options expiration off of the back of this FOMC. "
"2427370","2432650"," In March, we are getting a release of a vent valve tied to the FOMC statement, but also the massive"
"2432650","2437670"," kicker of huge put options expiring invoking large charm and vanna flows."
"2438830","2445310"," May 20 is the next expiration of significance for the S&P 500 in the PQQs."
"2445310","2448650"," 20% of delta, which suggests that we could get a good vanna. "
"2449150","2453130"," Dealer covering short hedges off of IV declines, but without a charm kicker."
"2454450","2458590"," Dealer is covering due to high time decay, thus the asterisk on the chart."
"2459450","2462130"," To put it more plainly, we think the market is set up for a solid rally. "
"2462870","2468230"," This is about the resetting relief of IV, not a removal of large put positions."
"2469330","2474110"," This arguably limits the upside fuel, but recall that the rally in March was a massive 11% from"
"2474110","2474330"," lows."
"2475310","2481290"," Here, a sharp 5% rally places us back into the 4400 ball trigger area, which is what we are"
"2481290","2483350"," currently sketching as an upside target. "
"2488240","2491520"," Here, I'll leave this stuff up, you guys can pause this, check some of your levels."
"2497660","2499140"," Ball trigger is at 4400."
"2499320","2500140"," That's what I was thinking that it was. "
"2503680","2504420"," It's not 42."
"2513960","2515360"," Scroll through there, get rid of this."
"2516720","2536650"," What they're trying to imply to you is that if you go over a month here, there's"
"2536650","2537390"," a ball trigger up here. "
"2539210","2542970"," What they're trying to imply to you is that there's the 20th over here, so we can make this"
"2542970","2543290"," smaller."
"2550950","2553430"," I think the OPEX is the 20th, it could be wrong on this."
"2565040","2573390"," Their point is you're going to expect something like this down into OPEX, and then a swing higher,"
"2573930","2575810"," something like this. "
"2578010","2585290"," If you want to project what you're looking for, if you want to take a 450 call, you probably want"
"2585290","2593450"," to take it a week or two after OPEX and allow for the markets to trade higher, bounce off, and"
"2593450","2601020"," then make a much larger move coming into OPEX for late May, if that makes any sense."
"2606840","2611700"," Now, as a matter of fact, I'm going to give it a better, if we have a 440 up in"
"2611700","2618540"," here, we snap lower, you're going to be wanting to at least, you want to see at least 410 hold."
"2619540","2620340"," It's a shitty looking swing. "
"2623590","2624870"," Get this little box right here."
"2626930","2632410"," We're looking for 440, and then a swing down."
"2632410","2634090"," Let's say this takes like two, three days. "
"2635130","2636050"," Slow grind down."
"2636170","2638250"," We could probably trade sideways in here, some kind of nonsense."
"2638410","2642470"," If we get trapped, we just look trade down to the 20th, and then you start to see this blast"
"2642470","2644630"," off to 450 or so. "
"2646090","2649150"," It's a really bad looking swing, but whatever."
"2649570","2650150"," You guys get the point."
"2651190","2652710"," I should have made it look prettier. "
"2655650","2656590"," That's terrible too."
"2656910","2657430"," It looks awful."
"2658290","2658830"," You get the point, right?"
"2659210","2660730"," You get the point that we're going to go to 440. "
"2661590","2667290"," Look for some support down into 410, and then ride this up to 450."
"2670290","2671250"," There you go."
"2671370","2673710"," There's your plan for May, something like this. "
"2676890","2683950"," That's not accounting for cessation of activities in Ukraine, headline news like that."
"2684090","2688430"," It's not accounting for the Fed saying something really whacked up to you."
"2692280","2694500"," That's the implication if the Fed goes well. "
"2696020","2702380"," That's the implication if there's no really bad news out of Russia or no great news out of Ukraine,"
"2702980","2708500"," anything like that, any kind of headline news, anything that's not unknown, that that would be the"
"2708500","2708960"," road map."
"2709880","2711860"," Even for bears, that would be the road map."
"2712040","2717520"," If everything is situation-normal into FOMC, you don't see anything crazy going on that you're"
"2717520","2717920"," going to see. "
"2718940","2725120"," Some kind of a swing high or swing up into FOMC and into Friday, heading up to 440."
"2726320","2726840"," Rejection."
"2727900","2729480"," Then we head back down, retest 410. "
"2729860","2731260"," You don't want to give up 410, right?"
"2732160","2734340"," Maybe that is the retest of 405."
"2736240","2737860"," Then the swing higher to 450."
"2743780","2753630"," On a larger time frame, even if we get up here to this 450, let's say we targeted"
"2753630","2759210"," 450 into FOMC, we're coming into summertime. "
"2760530","2766550"," If you want to start looking three, four, five, six months out, I don't know what to say to you."
"2767250","2767870"," I'm on the fence."
"2768130","2770270"," I've got a bull count and a bear count. "
"2773410","2775430"," Either way, I think it grinds."
"2775590","2779750"," I think it's going to grind either sideways enough or sideways and down for summer."
"2779750","2783230"," I think summer this year is going to be a tough one. "
"2784530","2786810"," I think it's going to be tough whether you're a bull or a bear."
"2786970","2790930"," I think your life is going to be surrounded by lots of spreads."
"2793760","2799160"," I think the intraday stuff is going to get lots of trap and lots of opening and closing places,"
"2799500","2800400"," plays, that kind of stuff. "
"2801380","2803960"," I don't think it really matters if it goes up and down."
"2804120","2811580"," I think right now, if you're an investor, that looks so horrible."
"2815560","2817540"," I need to delete all that shit. "
"2819420","2823540"," If you believe it or not, delete like 20 to 50% of it all the time as they move"
"2823540","2823920"," forward."
"2824480","2830060"," We'll look at Spy real quick for a launch."
"2830340","2830860"," That's a month out. "
"2831180","2832460"," We're talking about May right now."
"2836210","2837630"," We're going to look further out here."
"2841100","2841580"," This is Spy. "
"2841760","2842260"," We can look at ES."
"2842460","2842980"," It doesn't really matter."
"2843700","2845020"," I guess ES does matter more. "
"2848240","2849700"," It doesn't matter, but it shows better."
"2849980","2855400"," It shows better expanded area of training."
"2860960","2865880"," That market breath indicator, what's important about that is it doesn't matter if the market is"
"2865880","2868060"," going up or if the market is going down. "
"2870000","2875700"," As a bull, until we change trend, we're still going down."
"2876700","2879060"," For the summer, you're going to have to keep that in mind."
"2879600","2882000"," Until we change trend, any kind of trend, change. "
"2886160","2887360"," We haven't changed trend yet."
"2887900","2888420"," You can see that."
"2888700","2890840"," We have not changed our trend yet. "
"2891900","2895700"," We haven't changed our trend yet if we trade up here."
"2896520","2898340"," We haven't changed trend yet, have we?"
"2901090","2903310"," We could trend like this."
"2904690","2914550"," We still haven't changed trend until we break out of this negative channel, right?"
"2915530","2919110"," I'm not making this kind of sloppy, but this is a downward trend. "
"2922790","2926590"," Until we break out of this downward trend and you're a bull, right?"
"2927170","2928590"," You have to say, we're in a downward trend."
"2928750","2929550"," We're in a negative channel."
"2929890","2930830"," We haven't broken out of it yet. "
"2931330","2936350"," If you're like, hey, I'm a bull and I want to get bullish, you can't until we break out of"
"2936350","2936770"," this trend."
"2940320","2942740"," It doesn't matter if we start going like this sideways."
"2943220","2947360"," It doesn't matter if we start going like this, or like this, higher, whatever. "
"2948000","2949280"," We haven't broken out of it yet."
"2949560","2951080"," Until that happens, you can't get bullish."
"2952500","2959020"," So as a bull, until you break out of that trend, your best place as a bull, if you, that's"
"2959020","2963680"," all you do is buy dips, is to be looking at these capitulation movements over time. "
"2964380","2967460"," This is all summer long and selling for profit above."
"2968500","2971860"," Buy a dip, sell for profit, and you wait for the next one."
"2973460","2977320"," You even wait for the next one if it's above and you're just going to wait for these capitulation"
"2977320","2977500"," moments. "
"2977680","2978580"," They happen every month or two."
"2979500","2980580"," Price doesn't matter."
"2981520","2988780"," And you are selling for profit until the channel changes, until you can just snap some lines like"
"2988780","2991220"," this and say, hey, look cap, we've broken trend. "
"2994740","2997780"," Until that happens, we're still in a downward trend."
"3001380","3003200"," Where does the Fed put come in?"
"3006040","3007860"," Let's say we start trending down for the summer."
"3008080","3008520"," I don't think we do. "
"3008600","3011640"," I think we trade sideways and slightly down or slightly up."
"3011640","3014140"," We're either going to do a slow grind up or a slow grind down in the summertime."
"3014280","3015000"," In my view. "
"3017740","3019200"," To me, I don't really care where we go."
"3019380","3021280"," If we trade down, I'm fine."
"3021920","3023180"," The faster we go down, the better. "
"3025060","3028940"," The faster we get down to 360, 240, whatever."
"3030560","3033120"," The faster we can get back to a bull market, in my view."
"3034020","3039260"," You want to dick around with sideways all summer long, it's going to suck. "
"3039780","3044700"," You want to dick around with us going up for fucking until December and then have a fucking market"
"3044700","3045040"," crash?"
"3045340","3045940"," You're insane."
"3047040","3053680"," The best way for everybody if this works out is if we do a slow decline, hit some lower numbers,"
"3054000","3056680"," 360, 240, bounce here and there."
"3057440","3060880"," That's probably the best solution for everybody. "
"3061680","3066320"," To release the indexes, even if you see some tickers, some individual tickers catching bids that"
"3066320","3067200"," have been burned to the ground."
"3068900","3075300"," The best solution in the solution the Fed is probably working towards is that we bring the market"
"3075300","3083200"," down slowly, we decrease demand for buying the market, make people go away and do something else"
"3083200","3086700"," and then they restart the market back up again."
"3087200","3088340"," Once they hit some real low numbers. "
"3090100","3093080"," On the other side, we're going to burn this shit down."
"3093300","3094420"," I don't know why you'd want to do that."
"3095560","3096700"," It wouldn't be pretty. "
"3097820","3101720"," A nice slow state of decline, one to three years, a little bit of resetting going on."
"3102740","3104800"," That's probably the best thing to happen."
"3107420","3110380"," That's the best possible outcome. "
"3112140","3115720"," That appeases both bears and bulls for a longer term growth."
"3116080","3120760"," If you're a bull out there and you fucking want to see 6,000 right now, all you're asking for"
"3120760","3122220"," is a crash at some point."
"3122220","3124900"," That's all you're asking for, like a severe crash. "
"3127160","3131700"," If you're a bear and you want to mark crash today, they would have to make a market today if"
"3131700","3132260"," we had a mark crash."
"3132560","3133600"," So I'm not an agreement with the bulls."
"3133760","3134920"," I'm not agreeing with the bears on this. "
"3136360","3137940"," Slow and steady sideways and down."
"3138160","3139160"," Couple capitulation moments."
"3140000","3147000"," A bloodbath or two here and there seems like the idea here. "
"3147160","3148000"," You got to cool this off."
"3148000","3148600"," This is insane."
"3148880","3151140"," See, you have to cool this off. "
"3152240","3152860"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3153720","3155760"," You got to cool some of this off down here."
"3157440","3159500"," You got to get it down here a little bit."
"3160480","3162160"," But I think they should take some time doing it too. "
"3162260","3164620"," I don't think that they want to crash it."
"3165560","3166540"," I don't think they're going on."
"3166660","3170640"," This is going to be important to the FOMC meeting. "
"3171560","3172620"," I think he's bullish."
"3173620","3175180"," Do you guys want to know my personal take?"
"3175180","3177420"," I think he's not going to be as hawkish."
"3180900","3182600"," See a little sneaky pizza up here?"
"3183700","3184760"," I think he's going to be bullish. "
"3185100","3186420"," Not bullish."
"3189180","3194000"," There's an argument to me that he's going to save the credit markets and let the equity market"
"3194000","3194380"," burn."
"3195280","3195800"," I don't know. "
"3197600","3203400"," I agree with the statement that if you break 4,000 this week, that you could see aggressive"
"3203400","3205240"," selling, panic selling."
"3207300","3208660"," I don't think they allow that."
"3209940","3211540"," Do I think we can break 4,000?"
"3211700","3211820"," Yes. "
"3212180","3213600"," But I don't think it's something they're going to know."
"3214080","3215320"," I think we break 4,000."
"3215420","3217320"," It's going to be something that triggers it that we missed. "
"3218500","3219140"," Or they missed."
"3220720","3224080"," Or some guy in the currency market said they never listened to me."
"3225040","3227180"," Or some banker said they didn't listen to me. "
"3228440","3233180"," I think if they intentionally drop it to below 4,000 like this week, I think it's kind of insane."
"3233180","3239060"," I don't think that the Fed's mandate is to protect the markets."
"3239360","3241940"," It's not to trigger a mass selling event. "
"3242940","3243700"," It's not their job."
"3245900","3253720"," So if they can keep it like 4,000 and FMC tomorrow, they're going to attempt to prop up the"

"3263700","3266740"," I don't think you're going to get the bullish Fed chair, but I don't think you're going to get the"
"3266740","3267660"," hawkish one either. "
"3267660","3269100"," I think you're going to get middle of the road neutral."
"3271420","3274400"," I think the QT thing is not going to be as aggressive as you think it is."
"3274920","3277360"," I don't think it's in the equity's market. "
"3277960","3283800"," I think you're going to see the money flow stay in the system in the credit markets, in the"
"3283800","3284540"," currency markets."
"3285900","3287120"," Tail risk though."
"3289260","3290880"," Let's talk about some tail risk. "
"3292960","3297200"," When you're trying to get bullish out there on this market in a macro sense, you've got to"
"3297200","3299200"," understand there's some things going on in the background."
"3300340","3309420"," You've got third, fourth world countries right now that are falling into deep recessions and"
"3309420","3310020"," depressions."
"3310020","3316200"," You have commodities and goods. "
"3317840","3320020"," You've manufactured goods, right?"
"3320780","3321920"," These aren't alchemists."
"3322420","3324800"," There's like two tails of the commodities market."
"3325640","3329820"," There's like the wheat commodities market, gas commodities market, right?"
"3330600","3340280"," But then there are materials for manufactured goods for people like us that we consume that there's"
"3340280","3344380"," less demand for down the road in futures. "
"3345760","3351020"," We're pricing in right now in futures for manufactured goods less demand."
"3354940","3356980"," We need to start to look at our ports."
"3357180","3362320"," Some of the ports don't have container ships because Shanghai is closed. "
"3363200","3366960"," When you look at the futures of what's expected, the needs that are going to be expected, they're"
"3366960","3368680"," going to drop and get lower and lower."
"3369280","3370500"," So over time, right?"
"3371300","3375400"," Some of these economic, macro economic things are going to come by us in the ass."
"3376580","3382360"," So you're going to see our market where you're going to see. "
"3382360","3386840"," You're going to get management office to sell two and a quarter billion sterling of 0.875% green"
"3386840","3388200"," gilts on May 10th."
"3389260","3391260"," You're going to see demand for housing go down."
"3391440","3393760"," You're going to see demand for commercial buildings based on that. "
"3393760","3395660"," You're going to see demand for goods go down."
"3396100","3396780"," You are."
"3397040","3398120"," You're going to see it. "
"3399920","3401700"," What did Amazon say the other day?"
"3402560","3404500"," Amazon said we built too many buildings."
"3405460","3407020"," We're going to start laying people off."
"3408800","3410080"," They said the other day, right?"
"3410940","3418800"," So these companies are pricing and anticipating a weaker economy for the next one, two, three"
"3418800","3419000"," years. "
"3419000","3425840"," So there's no reason for us not to trade this market down over the next two, three years."
"3426100","3429220"," And there's no reason for the Fed not to support it as it trades down."
"3429600","3431140"," They should, and they will. "
"3432060","3434320"," But I don't think the Fed put is here at 360."
"3434740","3435320"," I think it's lower."
"3437240","3440500"," I think they'll support markets at so soft landing, right?"
"3440640","3441780"," That's what we always hear soft landing. "
"3441960","3443620"," So if we get too low, we're down at 440."
"3444280","3446360"," They're going to support the market into this FMC."
"3447360","3452160"," That's not a support, though, that's going to be, hey, we're going to all-time highs. "
"3452420","3455060"," It's support so that you feel comfortable with 440."
"3456280","3458320"," You can trade, or about 440, 400."
"3459680","3461360"," You feel comfortable down here at 400. "
"3461760","3463240"," We can trade 400 to 450."
"3464400","3466720"," And then we'll trade it down to, believe it or not, 380."
"3467240","3468600"," And then we'll trade it down to 360. "
"3469560","3471020"," And then we'll trade it down to 340."
"3472640","3475900"," People, I can agree with people who can disagree if we go lower than 360."
"3476240","3482420"," But 240, 260 somewhere in there would not shock me if it gets worse in three years. "
"3482540","3484960"," If it's just a year or two, not so bad."
"3485620","3491700"," But I don't think it's crazy to think that the market's going to trade down sideways and down over"
"3491700","3492500"," the next couple of years."
"3492520","3494680"," Or they're going to attempt to do that. "
"3496620","3498240"," Let's make a key difference here."
"3498360","3501280"," They're going to attempt to do that."
"3501420","3504400"," And along the way, you'll get some large sales. "
"3504400","3506260"," You'll get some violent sales on the sell-offs."
"3506420","3510660"," So if you're a bull out there, your plan has changed."
"3511380","3514260"," Your plan is, you're going to be sticking around with guys like me. "
"3515940","3519000"," You're going to be looking for those moments where we could pitch late."
"3520340","3521720"," It happens almost every month, month and a half."
"3522260","3523920"," And you're going to get your kick-ass buying opportunity. "
"3527260","3532080"," If you want to throw 10% of your money at some put spreads, every time they come to a"
"3532080","3535200"," top, you just throw some put spreads on their date at a month, month and a half out and you'll"
"3535200","3535760"," print."
"3536580","3537480"," Don't look at your computer."
"3538060","3539640"," That's going to be the easiest way to trade this market. "
"3540700","3546900"," The easiest way to trade this market truly is going to be put spreads at the tops, call spreads at"
"3546900","3547380"," the bottoms."
"3547540","3548540"," You can buy some zero dates."
"3549000","3552100"," Jill Netta loves buying call dates when you can pitch late down here. "
"3552200","3552740"," I agree with that."
"3552940","3553300"," I do it."
"3553460","3554080"," I buy zero dates. "
"3555160","3557580"," But this is a traders market."
"3558980","3560560"," I agree this is a traders market."
"3560560","3563040"," And I made some good money in this market. "
"3563540","3565480"," But I don't think most investors are."
"3565740","3567080"," And I don't think most traders are."
"3567860","3569920"," I think like swing traders are getting fucked up. "
"3570100","3570600"," I think..."
"3570600","3571800"," I already shouldn't say even swing traders."
"3571880","3573440"," I think most traders are getting fucked up."
"3573820","3576240"," Most investors are getting fucked up in this market. "
"3576920","3580960"," And I have a hard time believing that even bears to an extent are doing well in this market."
"3581560","3587260"," I think timing, even on the short side of the long put side, is still a challenge for even a"
"3587260","3588120"," lot of bears out there."
"3589560","3594960"," I think this market is a good DM all the time from people whether they're bull or bear saying I'm"
"3594960","3596580"," not having fun in this market. "
"3598620","3600580"," I'm blowing up accounts in this market."
"3600880","3607460"," So I think this market for a lot of investors and traders is going to require patience."
"3609340","3610360"," That's what I really think. "
"3610460","3613940"," I think that you're looking for like capitulation moves take long."
"3613940","3619180"," I think you're looking for some screaming rips in the market for you to take a short."
"3619800","3622400"," I think you get your ass blown out in this market if you're a bear. "
"3623240","3624960"," And they just said that this morning, right?"
"3625100","3627580"," They said you saw this and I agreed with this on Twitter."
"3628180","3631600"," A bear market involves a lot of crazy rips."
"3632320","3633520"," A multiple people said yesterday. "
"3634160","3636260"," You saw a 100 point move yesterday in an hour."
"3638250","3639230"," In one hour, right?"
"3639370","3640070"," You saw a 100 point move."
"3640610","3642630"," Last week you saw a 100 point move, I think. "
"3642930","3644710"," I think it was 100 points in an hour."
"3644710","3646610"," Just fucking 20% move."
"3647030","3647470"," That's 20. "
"3647930","3648410"," Sorry."
"3648710","3649290"," Excuse me."
"3650050","3654190"," A 2% move or 1% move in an hour and then a 1% move in an hour. "
"3654570","3655310"," You saw it here, right?"
"3655630","3656110"," See it right here."
"3658420","3659700"," One giant one right here."
"3659960","3666720"," Tulane Finance Ministry pegging their 2020 GDP growth at 1.5%. That's Chile. "
"3667480","3670500"," I talked to you about the crash in 2020 in March."
"3670740","3673520"," I said to you, I said, I was like, I don't think a fuck ton of you are in that"
"3673520","3673720"," crash."
"3674020","3679870"," I'm like, dude, there was a 10% swing in that crash. "
"3681510","3682870"," And I don't care who you are."
"3683090","3688310"," If you're a bear and you're fucking in that crash and you see a 10% up move, 10%."
"3690090","3691110"," You're going to capitulate. "
"3692710","3694890"," You're going to fucking pull your shorts and your puts."
"3696950","3698330"," And you're not going to continue to hold."
"3700370","3702870"," So, you know, like, you're going to see that in this market. "
"3702870","3710370"," You're going to see in this market, you know, slow grinds down and huge moves up."
"3712190","3712590"," Right?"
"3712710","3713110"," Sorry right here."
"3713190","3713350"," Boom. "
"3713570","3714490"," There's one right there, right?"
"3714730","3715290"," Boom, right there."
"3715750","3717170"," This will fuck a bear up in two seconds."
"3717470","3718250"," These two moves right here. "
"3719010","3720090"," I don't care who you are up there."
"3720470","3725650"," It takes a talented, well disciplined bear to not get fucked up and shit like this."
"3727150","3733790"," And gold futures holding near the highs of the day probing new highs here at 1878 up about 14 bucks"
"3733790","3735290"," or three quarters of a percent. "
"3736250","3740570"," So the key here would be if you're a bear silver, a corner and a quarter percent today."
"3740950","3746550"," These are some beautiful fucking history saying they expect 2022 average foreign exchange rated 811"
"3746550","3747850"," pesos per dollar."
"3749390","3752150"," We're getting to the end of this one, believe it or not. "
"3753510","3761840"," So if you're a bear, you're probably going to, if I was a bear in this market, I'd fucking pack"
"3761840","3763940"," it up and wait for this."
"3767290","3768230"," Because I've been waiting for it."
"3768230","3769730"," If I was a bear, fuck it. "
"3769790","3770050"," I'm done."
"3770770","3771410"," I'll be back in a month."
"3772930","3774730"," I don't know when we get here, but we're going to get here. "
"3774950","3776750"," And when we do, I'm going to short the fuck out of it."
"3777290","3778910"," If I was a bear, that's what we tell myself."
"3780050","3780290"," I'm done. "
"3780810","3781150"," Wrap it up."
"3782350","3782750"," Go home."
"3782750","3785710"," Even if we trade it down below here at 380, let's say, what do you care?"
"3785970","3786730"," It's coming back up here. "
"3787530","3789270"," And this is where the next sexy short is."
"3789630","3790330"," Probably like 440."
"3792650","3799350"," I'd start putting the shorts on or long puts on put, put a, put spreads up here. "
"3799610","3800410"," Fucking beautiful idea."
"3800730","3801070"," 438."
"3803510","3804550"," ABC entries up here. "
"3806430","3806670"," Right."
"3807050","3808830"," Start, start rolling into this stuff over here."
"3809770","3810910"," Just look for the next one to take it down. "
"3811590","3812510"," Into summertime."
"3813690","3815750"," Seems at this point seems responsible."
"3817390","3818310"," Seems rational. "
"3821790","3824410"," So if you're a bear, this is a great fucking trade."
"3824810","3825070"," Take ass."
"3826430","3828330"," No, the market doesn't just keep going down. "
"3828610","3829190"," And I'll tell you what."
"3829290","3832810"," If the market does go down below 400, I promise you."
"3833650","3835310"," You're going to see a 10% move up. "
"3836530","3837470"," You're going to get trapped."
"3838950","3842050"," So if you're a bear, probably better to sit this one out."
"3842710","3844570"," Maybe go long down here at some point. "
"3846470","3850750"," The probability is down here that you're going to take a nice bat long higher."
"3852770","3856050"," There's another probability of a long opportunity in end of May."
"3856850","3859630"," And it's probably a good short opportunity in the end of May. "
"3859710","3863030"," If we get a ripper here the next couple days, today, tomorrow, whatever."
"3864330","3864750"," And you're a bear."
"3864930","3865350"," You want to take another. "
"3865350","3866770"," It's Fontero auction data."
"3867270","3870410"," Global dairy trade price index, dropping a point five percent."
"3871110","3873770"," Homile powder price index falling six point five percent. "
"3875030","3880150"," You might get a good, I might get a good short or long put position week or two."
"3881830","3886430"," And then the big one, of course, for you is going to probably be after the OPEC's for May."
"3887010","3889490"," Probably get a nice juicy put spread there. "
"3891010","3894560"," If you're a bear, if you're a bull."
"3895620","3897120"," You're looking for bottoms down here."
"3898220","3899920"," You're looking for events to roll off. "
"3900240","3901260"," Get an event tomorrow."
"3901680","3902960"," You're looking for this event to roll off."
"3903620","3904400"," And you pick your poison. "
"3904700","3905860"," Put call spread right here works."
"3906380","3907420"," Call spread down here works."
"3908380","3910000"," Do a call spread that's in the money over here. "
"3910580","3914920"," Do a call spread that's to 430, 440 over here."
"3915780","3917780"," For like, I don't know, two weeks, three weeks."
"3919480","3921800"," Should print fair chance of it printing. "
"3921820","3926240"," Let's get a really nasty fed meeting or speech tomorrow."
"3926780","3927300"," Presser."
"3928100","3933240"," The only thing I'll tell you about tomorrow's meeting is, or say in tomorrow's meeting is that"
"3933240","3934860"," tomorrow when they do the pressers. "
"3935420","3940260"," The beginning of them can sound one way or if they sound dumish."
"3940780","3945040"," If any bad questions come out, you'll sometimes see one quick trigger below and then a move higher."
"3945580","3949740"," You'll see that they usually keep the reporters ask the real questions until the end. "
"3957060","3958340"," How are y'all doing this morning?"
"3961240","3962520"," Y'all read that off to you."
"3962600","3963260"," Get on the milk pricing."
"3968060","3978040"," Fonterra global dairy trade, auction dairy trade index minus 8.5% versus minus 3.6% prior"

"3990420","3999760"," Oh yeah, the total volume of dairy products sold quantity sold in MT, $25,167 versus"
"3999760","4002200"," $22,179 prior."
"4017920","4023600"," Just keep on your macro sensibilities about the market, right?"
"4023900","4029580"," You're going to expect some weakness in the market heading down the road, not the market, the"
"4029580","4031100"," economy mixing those two up. "
"4031680","4034640"," In the economy you're going to expect some weakness down the road, one to three years."
"4035720","4037840"," The market, I don't think it matters"
"4037840","4047660"," if it trades up."
"4048480","4050880"," I don't care if the market trades sideways and down. "
"4052180","4055940"," And then we don't have a black swan event, we just have some huge capitulation moments."
"4057840","4065960"," Either way, the safest trade the next year, as the market develops, whether it trades sideways and"
"4065960","4073340"," down or belts up, the safest trade for you as a bull is going to be these capitulation moments."
"4074700","4082000"," When we have them, usually once a month, once every month and a half, once every two months, you"
"4082000","4083000"," can buy those in safety. "
"4099439","4104319"," If you're a bear, you know where you can short, you know where you can take a long put, right?"
"4105600","4109340"," You can see it players day in a chart, it's been sitting there for how many months?"
"4113590","4116109"," Since November, it's April or May, right?"
"4116229","4122240"," We're May now, not too hard, not too hard to figure it out."
"4124819","4131720"," Start thinking about it at 4.30. Start getting more aggressive at 4.40. Start really getting crazy"
"4131720","4132260"," up here."
"4132960","4134840"," Take this next leg down, look for some confirmation. "
"4136060","4141359"," Enough time on put spreads over here, then weeklies, then dailies and zero dates for the next leg"
"4141359","4141580"," down."
"4145040","4149580"," You have $30 billion in eight-week bills on May 5th, settling May 10th."
"4151080","4152760"," So it's only $35 billion in four-week bills. "
"4155020","4161000"," Some decent resistance above right now at 4.17. Looks like the spy is going to try to retest this"
"4161000","4161779"," the second time."
"4167720","4169439"," Sellers above at 4.20 as well."
"4173040","4178560"," And the price target above at 4.25. Lots of FOMO buyers at this 4.25. They wanted that this"
"4178560","4178779"," morning. "

"5668130","5670070"," It's now expanding to 72. "
"5674760","5675780"," Somewhere in here."
"5676620","5677960"," So the resistance was."
"5678920","5680200"," Resistance was. "
"5683480","5684880"," Like in here, right?"
"5685320","5685680"," Light resistance."
"5686300","5689500"," And then there was heavy resistance right at 420, but they're."
"5689800","5691380"," They're backing up higher now. "
"5692760","5695300"," So that means the point being is."
"5696700","5698080"," Rather than it's being top."
"5698860","5701860"," That this could possibly top could possibly be higher. "
"5702600","5706320"," If this is top or was top, looks like you might be able to get up in here."
"5706320","5708740"," One big tag and then come back down."
"5727880","5729360"," Just one more quick market warning. "
"5729380","5730500"," We need to get the side of the way."
"5736380","5737580"," Was he in paying attention?"
"5749870","5750730"," He ain't there."
"5757280","5760080"," Just to an extent here. "
"5771080","5773660"," Say I run a VIX chart on two different."
"5777840","5778760"," Two different computers."
"5779020","5779780"," So I got a."
"5780160","5784730"," I thought they had the one that I show you guys. "
"5785250","5785330"," Okay."
"5785630","5787590"," So on this VIX chart right here."
"5789980","5792760"," Just be careful as we're coming to this top over here. "
"5792900","5793280"," You got this."
"5794080","5796460"," Keep your eyes on the VIX come down here, right?"
"5797800","5801680"," Probably going to at some point, at least even if we don't slap up higher."
"5802040","5803960"," Just be conscious of even if it breaks. "
"5804940","5806960"," Just be conscious down here."
"5807100","5808480"," There should be at least some kind of."
"5810240","5812180"," Volatility and spy with where we are. "
"5814220","5815860"," I don't know if it's going to break up higher."
"5816020","5817680"," I don't know if it's going to fall off."
"5818980","5822220"," But regardless where we are right now on the spy. "
"5823720","5825680"," You can see that there's some support here."
"5827620","5828980"," I'm going to see this right here."
"5832440","5832700"," Right?"
"5832820","5833420"," Found some support. "
"5833740","5835840"," Went back out to find out if this is where they wanted to be."
"5836340","5836860"," Came up."
"5837940","5840580"," Coming back out of that same level of support right here. "
"5841860","5843520"," Could be another check down below."
"5844120","5847220"," But be careful of this as we head into tomorrow."
"5849500","5851580"," Also remember we're still up at 30 here. "
"5851740","5854080"," 30 is to be expected heading into FMC."
"5856920","5860160"," I wasn't paying attention to it just a minute ago and then I was like, oh shit."
"5861820","5866400"," I was like, so even this tap up in here. "
"5868880","5870420"," It's a nice tap above here."
"5870600","5878280"," You could end up seeing some consolidation down in here as the VIX consolidates and decides where"
"5878280","5879060"," it's going here."
"5879800","5882260"," To be conscious of the VIX right now where we're at. "
"5885920","5889480"," If you're going to see some consolidation here."
"5890680","5891540"," Move higher."
"5892700","5899920"," If the VIX decides it wants to go up, you're going to definitely see a move lower for support down"
"5903280","5904980"," around this area for 15 or so. "
"5906960","5912060"," For 1645, they look like there's some buyers there but I don't trust this as real support."
"6005530","6008110"," The repeating board is wrapping up trading for the day."
"6008610","6011970"," The foot C of one 10 to one percent of a tax of six tenths. "
"6012610","6014150"," And the cash up six tenths as well."
"6293670","6295990"," No stream technical difficulties."
"6296010","6297870"," I was leaving this up here for you guys to watch. "
"6299230","6301170"," As you can see it break back down here."
"6303860","6304800"," It's taking a quick break here."
"6310640","6312660"," Let's see where support is down below. "
"6313180","6315180"," Real support is down below here at 416."
"6316080","6317320"," Slightly above VWAP."
"6317500","6318780"," You can see it on the right hand side here. "
"6326980","6329280"," It's right in this vicinity here."
"6331000","6332120"," This comes swooping up."
"6333240","6334820"," First it buys down here at A."
"6336000","6339900"," I said this B is probably B at VWAP and then C down here. "
"6344640","6347380"," You could probably move this up to VWAP over here."
"6348760","6349580"," Draw C."
"6349580","6350940"," I should have added that in an ABC."
"6362540","6364660"," Maybe wherever VWAP comes up. "
"6367710","6368730"," It's pretty good sellers."
"6369070","6372890"," There's like a monster up here hiding at 420 to 426."
"6379080","6380040"," Move that over. "
"6381180","6383340"," It's like 416 somewhere in here."
"6383480","6388680"," This kind of match up at 416.50. This is another layer here."
"6389040","6394760"," Back here there were some buyers down here at 416.50. We'll probably move this up this view up. "
"6394920","6395380"," Keep coming up."
"6396120","6397960"," Do somewhere in ABC, dip by."
"6426960","6428620"," Could be another move up still. "
"6429040","6449670"," If there's still room to run up on this VIX here, 28 bucks, there's still a chance that this weird"
"6449670","6451130"," hair doesn't show up on my chart."
"6456810","6457530"," Put it down here."
"6459710","6462790"," There's a little bit more room to squeeze up here. "
"6465830","6469310"," I'll be looking for the VIX to sell down at 28.86 or so."
"6470830","6472950"," This is a place, though."
"6473570","6478980"," We've spent a lot of time down here at this 30-12. "
"6479460","6484380"," If it does start to trade sideways a little bit, we'll see some resistance on the spy."
"6497000","6499140"," If you guys like mood music, I'll put some mood music on."
"6499280","6503620"," Hold on one second here. "
"6514040","6515620"," I'll put some mood music on."
"6540600","6541580"," Let me just take it."
"6569280","6570380"," Yeah, I've got..."
"6573520","6575440"," Let me know in the background what you think. "
"6576100","6577080"," I don't normally put it on."
"6577380","6578360"," I like to trade the news on."
"6578980","6582240"," I could put some low background music that's very low. "
"6582700","6589200"," I can adjust the sound volume, just like real, real quiet in the background if you prefer it."
"6590220","6593180"," You'd be able to hear trade the news over it for sure."
"6594300","6597440"," There'll probably be some jazz, some kind, some just some chill jazz. "
"6599380","6600780"," Piano jazz or something in the background."
"6603720","6605120"," I've got copyright-free music."
"6613110","6614270"," I'll wait to another broadcast. "
"6614630","6615830"," I'll test it out and you guys see what you think."
"6617190","6619070"," If you don't want to play anything that you're not going to like."
"6622350","6623350"," Yeah, I don't like..."
"6625010","6625950"," Okay, so no music. "
"6626570","6630270"," I don't like the music on because I figured if you guys want to play your own jams in the"
"6630270","6631570"," background, it kind of sucks."
"6631850","6634610"," I mean, all of y'all have your own music styles out there."
"6635130","6636850"," I don't like the music in the background, typically. "
"6638230","6642670"," I like to hear trade the news, me talking and then put my own jams on the background on another"
"6642670","6643350"," device or something."
"6644710","6646270"," I'm kind of forced to listen to my music."
"6648450","6652930"," Meanwhile, you guys can like, you know, do your jam in the background. "
"6657470","6659010"," Catch you a nice bit in the spice though."
"6659230","6661490"," Still watching more spice calls come in right now."
"6661490","6662470"," They're just keep rolling in. "
"6662610","6663370"," Nice, large contracts."
"6665050","6667390"," All four are the fourth of May."
"6668290","6672890"," Lots of bulls just step it in with short-dated calls for tomorrow. "
"6674490","6675870"," Pretty substantial too."
"6676030","6679630"," I'm on the options flow right now, so if you guys want to check that out real quick."
"6682020","6685400"," Tesla's got five orders for $6.7 million on it. "
"6686260","6690840"," Some pretty chunky orders for $5, $6, $5, $20, $5, $27."
"6690840","6694700"," This bolsters Tesla, believe it or not, seeing these calls."
"6695980","6698240"," Spy has 16 orders on it. "
"6698460","6699400"," $4.3 million."
"6699980","6703860"," Not a ton of money, but a nice breadth to them."
"6704160","6707960"," My only concern here is that they're all for tomorrow's expiry. "
"6709580","6715960"," They're all kind of in the money, $4.25. And at that bell, there was, at the opening bell this"
"6715960","6718200"," morning, there was a lot of $4.25 from HFTs."
"6720990","6725730"," It makes me wonder about tomorrow with a big coming into the market to all kinds of tickers."
"6726230","6728990"," All kinds of individual tickers captured a bid today. "
"6730130","6733890"," Not big money, all small money, $100,000, $200,000, $600,000."
"6734310","6741050"," Bank of Mexico board member, indicating that price control only works over the short-term."
"6741370","6744330"," I'm not really paying too much attention to individual tickers today. "
"6745150","6745730"," Sometimes I'll follow up."
"6745730","6749170"," Bank of Mexico's keepsaying price controls can only work over the short-term."
"6750150","6750910"," Individual tickers. "
"6751150","6753110"," Arcade's been getting a bid, I think, past couple of days."
"6754950","6756130"," But I've been paying attention to them."
"6756210","6757930"," My only focus right now is the Fed meeting. "
"6758110","6759930"," Fed meeting can turn this whole market upside down."
"6760030","6765450"," I'm not a bear here, but my whole, my whole, my whole trade here is based on the Fed meeting."
"6766190","6770370"," The bid on Spy, the only thing I do can say I don't like on it is that they expire"
"6770370","6770830"," tomorrow. "
"6771410","6772990"," They're all five, four calls."
"6773650","6777970"," Whenever I see that there's like another day left in those calls, the market makers at some point"
"6777970","6779390"," will try to fucking burn them down."
"6780350","6784510"," So I'll look for an opening in those calls at some point between tomorrow, if I can, if I can"
"6784510","6784790"," get it. "
"6787030","6790050"," We're kind of kicking around up here at 4.18, 16, looking for acceptance."
"6791110","6795310"," There is some nice support forming here at 4.17. This is nice to see here."
"6795950","6798830"," Like seeing this 4.17, see this right here, enter day support. "
"6799950","6805490"," I don't like the idea of trading below it to 4.16 or even VWAP or even some, there's a"
"6805490","6806950"," lot of space down here to fall."
"6806950","6808790"," You can see all the space down here."
"6809590","6811150"," And 4.10 is real support. "
"6811650","6812750"," Kind of just hanging out up here."
"6813350","6815650"," Nothing holding us up except for right where we are."
"6816490","6818290"," But this is kind of nice here to see. "
"6818650","6821490"," Starting to see some resistance form above as well."
"6822010","6828250"," Real sellers above here at 4.19.50. Just be conscious as we get close to this 4.20 that"
"6828250","6829370"," the market can roll."
"6830130","6832330"," More from Bank of Mexico's heat thing. "
"6832590","6836510"," It's okay to think outside the box on policies to address inflation."
"6838880","6840600"," Just be careful as we get up in here."
"6840740","6846360"," This is a place to take profit and then make a reentry at 4.20. Talk about this in this"
"6846360","6847120"," channel often. "
"6847260","6851980"," We're going to talk about it right now again because I keep hearing or I saw someone in chat saying"
"6851980","6855060"," to get about 4.20. We can go to 430 real quick."
"6855980","6856560"," No one cares."
"6857500","6860880"," Like not you saying that, but no one should care. "
"6860880","6867560"," We knew yesterday down here the price target above was 4.18. We knew here we said that right."
"6867660","6870700"," Price targets 4.18 in 4.20, right?"
"6870880","6875720"," We're going to get up to 4.18, 4.20. We just retested here in cash market 4.18, 93."
"6876140","6882020"," It's not quite 4.20. But even if we do get to this 4.20 above what you do up"
"6882020","6886560"," in these zones, when you start trading up in here, you take profit off the table. "
"6887680","6896720"," And you literally wait until we create new support above 4.20 for a trade higher from there."
"6896940","6904000"," You don't take the trade from 4.05 up to 4.19 or 4, even 4.20 and say I'm"
"6904000","6905540"," diamond handed all this shit up to 430."
"6905800","6906380"," You just don't do it. "
"6906920","6907600"," It's not enough money."
"6907720","6908860"," You don't want your money taken away."
"6909620","6913340"," You take the money off the table, trade it up to the from level to level. "
"6914000","6916520"," And then you look for a breakthrough."
"6917100","6919380"," This area here, we get into these areas, these new levels."
"6920460","6927600"," What I know is how I was compared to is you're waiting for a bank, someone with real money, right?"
"6928080","6930900"," To break us through here, do the hard work for you. "
"6931640","6936240"," And then you pick it back up once it's found help to push you up."
"6937020","6939640"," Same thing works on support levels too."
"6940400","6944480"," If you start trading down here, if we start trading down here, I don't think this is the top. "
"6944780","6950320"," If it is top, you're looking for some support, right?"
"6950680","6952640"," Something that's becoming support."
"6953500","6959000"," It looks like 4.17 is becoming some form of support, but you're looking for some support to buy on."
"6960040","6961440"," Same thing in resistance levels. "
"6961900","6966380"," You only just buy in the middle of wherever when you're catching knives, you want to be catching"
"6966380","6966960"," knives on."
"6967920","6970220"," Where it looks like there's some support."
"6970560","6971620"," You can see it down here too. "
"6972380","6973640"," Kind of hiding down here."
"6973800","6981100"," There's some buyers down here, 4.17, 4.17, 4.16ish, 4.16 down here."
"6981580","6985520"," So if you're a buyer, let's say already long, you're like, hey, I'm going to wait until it gets"
"6985520","6989460"," down to 4.16 if you want to be adding to your position. "
"6989460","6996120"," Then you also know that if this breaks, this is 4.16, that you could be led lower down to"
"6996120","6998200"," 4.15 and you've got nothing below it, how old?"
"6999240","7001820"," This is just a vacuum down here."
"7002460","7009700"," This is the magnet down to 4.10. So you have stop losses somewhere down here at 4.15.02."
"7016790","7019990"," And you can see those as they're expressed here in the chart."
"7019990","7024290"," This is 4.15. This is your C, this is your A on this 4.16 here. "
"7024310","7027890"," More from Heath saying the Mexican government is within its right to implement price controls."
"7028610","7030290"," A, B, C, profit."
"7030770","7033310"," I don't have to make a Mexico can only offer opinions and advice. "
"7034390","7036770"," For stop loss, I should say right down in here."
"7038190","7040570"," Because you're going to wind up going down and then boom."
"7040870","7043030"," That's where the bears take over and boom and they're on it. "
"7067340","7070000"," Also watching a nice bid on TLT this morning."
"7071100","7075640"," TLT April 21st, 119 C, $724,000."
"7078000","7080120"," I haven't checked in on HYG today. "
"7081380","7085780"," Get the whole HYG crowd out there begging the fed to support."
"7086320","7089500"," Can I get some change?"
"7090200","7091180"," That's what HYG is saying."
"7092000","7094280"," They're shaking their cup out and you can't cut them off. "
"7094280","7099920"," They had their catch in a bid this morning."
"7100140","7109240"," TLT is also forming a bull flag of kinds here."
"7113360","7115660"," Vic's starting to find some support down here at 312. "
"7239710","7241190"," Some nice dip buys coming up here."
"7242350","7340450"," 4.17.15, 4.16.61, and 4.15.68. There's"
"7340450","7347510"," a bid down here, 5.70, 6.28, 4.48 down here in this bid."
"7352360","7354500"," Pretty strong right where we are right now. "
"7354740","7359140"," 4.17.46, pretty decent bid right in here right now."
"7359480","7359960"," It's pretty good."
"7373030","7378650"," Poorly, Apple hiring a former Ford veteran to ramp up its car project. "
"7385620","7391420"," Previously, Desi Uchkerchavek had served as the Ford Safety Engineering Director."
"7398720","7399760"," Let's see if this is the pump."
"7406080","7407280"," Nice push to get it up there. "
"7412320","7413820"," There are weak bids down here."
"7414420","7415860"," These aren't even strong bids down here."
"7416280","7417560"," Right here is where the bidding is. "
"7450280","7451700"," Some nice bidding right in here."
"7467670","7469030"," Doing it a push higher here."
"7469230","7470890"," Try to retest these upper bounds. "
"7471250","7482440"," 4.19.48, 4 "
"7482440","7490640",".29. It's kind of the do-it-a-do-it-eye spot for the bulls."
"7491960","7492780"," I want to say a good push."
"7494020","7495860"," See the bulls can push it up there and grab that 420. "
"7520280","7521740"," Can I explain how to read it?"
"7521940","7523680"," There's some things to be looking for."
"7523800","7528860"," There's numbers over here that are showing how many puts and calls are being bought."
"7530840","7533660"," My hero indicator is not working, so I'm not quite sure why. "
"7533880","7536020"," I was on hero support this morning."
"7536640","7541660"," They tend to put you on hold and you end up talking to them for two hours."
"7542400","7545440"," Sometimes there's live support and sometimes they're too busy. "
"7545920","7547620"," This morning was there too busy."
"7548460","7550020"," I was trying to figure out what was going on with hero."
"7551760","7557120"," I don't have their hero indicator going, but down here below here, they're showing the buy sells. "
"7557380","7558480"," We're trending up right now."
"7558560","7563580"," This yellow line would show you if we've got more puts than calls or more calls than put."
"7564100","7567000"," I'm going to show you that right now we have more calls than put in the market. "
"7568280","7570560"," Not a huge bid, but decent."
"7570960","7574340"," We're in a low volume day today at this moment."
"7574600","7579140"," The bulls are somewhat winning at this point the day. "
"7579460","7582460"," I haven't seen a switch to the put side at this point."
"7582460","7590160"," It looks like there's a concerted effort to get up here to $4.19. 50, $4.20. You can see"
"7590160","7593280"," on the right-hand side here, this is how it says $103,000."
"7593900","7594960"," It moves up and down. "
"7595220","7596620"," You also see a wave here."
"7598480","7602860"," You'll also see when you see less green on the right-hand side, more red, it means sellers are in"
"7602860","7603080"," charge."
"7604880","7609020"," When you see the greens swoop up, that means buyers more liquidity is in the market, right?"
"7610400","7613480"," You also want to be looking for coming right here. "
"7613560","7614740"," How many contracts are out there?"
"7614860","7621500"," How many buy at this price or at this ask are out there, right?"
"7621920","7622540"," The limit buys."
"7622920","7628420"," I want to buy this buy at $4.17.50. Or I want to buy it lower."
"7630400","7632800"," There's some concentration of contracts below. "
"7633020","7634720"," We are at least at $4.16, right?"
"7635340","7639640"," When I say that there's no depth to book down here, you can see there's no buyers down here."
"7639640","7642360"," Until you get to $4.10, right?"
"7643040","7644160"," No buyers in here."
"7644320","7646160"," You don't want to see like $4.16 break. "
"7647860","7651620"," These balls here also show you how many buyers the sellers there are."
"7652500","7656440"," Then I'll spread this out and in so I can get a clearer picture of where the top is."
"7657320","7663040"," I also want to see if buyers are getting pushed up or if sellers are pushing down. "
"7664500","7667820"," If you watch this long enough, you'll be able to see that."
"7668740","7677200"," You'll see pumping from bulls buying or HFPs or algos buying."
"7677720","7679700"," But other times you'll see bears pushing down. "
"7680400","7682460"," And you'll see that the bears have control when they're pushing down."
"7682920","7685200"," You'll see bulls have control when they're pushing up, right?"
"7685700","7687040"," Trying to get to a certain price target."
"7697690","7700290"," I'm going to be putting this all together with the hair indicator. "
"7700930","7703610"," So I called them this far and I called them again support this morning."
"7704830","7708510"," But I was having like fucking this dude talking to those guys."
"7708730","7709770"," It's like it's like an hour. "
"7709970","7711010"," It's always an hour at them."
"7711250","7713870"," Or if they're not there, you send them an email and it's three hours later."
"7714630","7715450"," Now they get back to you. "
"7717900","7719900"," But even without that information, we have it."
"7720020","7722980"," We have other places to look at information that's not visualized."
"7724880","7727320"," So you can see the sellers building up above, right?"
"7730060","7731480"," Kind of evenly matched right now. "
"7734130","7738030"," You can see down below on the right hand side, CVD buyers and sellers."
"7738530","7743070"," You want to see if you're bottoming and you see lots of volume coming to the market."
"7743210","7743730"," That's a bottoming. "
"7744010","7745290"," It's telling you that we're bottoming."
"7745290","7746090"," We're not going to keep going."
"7746990","7751830"," You want to be looking for volume, of course, in terms of going up or down. "
"7752270","7753130"," Low volume days."
"7753470","7754870"," We have and we're in if we're bullish."
"7755610","7761050"," I would say that we can make large moves on those days, right?"
"7764160","7767620"," You can see if I just reset the chart that we still have more buyers here. "
"7767620","7773640"," Buyers are in control right now down to $4.15.20 on the market, right?"
"7774080","7776100"," It supports that $4.17 or so."
"7777220","7780360"," You'll see waves of red come in to push down the buyers."
"7780720","7782960"," But buyers are in control, even though we're sitting here looking like repairs. "
"7783920","7785000"," Buyers are in control right now."
"7787720","7793880"," Price target above is $4.19.50. Upper bounds for $20.33 or so."
"7797780","7799320"," This is where they're waiting right above here. "
"7802040","7803720"," And this information changes, right?"
"7804360","7807920"," You'll see like we'll be sitting here in support, but you'll see a big red wave come down."
"7808240","7810120"," And that means they're trying to break through support."
"7811780","7813280"," This is bullish where we are right now. "
"7813280","7817500"," If you guys have one in context, this chart is showing you that we're bullish right now."
"7822740","7827160"," And then I'll scroll over a little parts here and look for, you know, what's the volume down here?"
"7828460","7829860"," How many bids are down here?"
"7829980","7831700"," You see how they get weaker as we come down, right?"
"7833400","7835900"," We're just past the top of the noon hour here in New York."
"7836040","7837580"," U.S. stock markets holding near the highs. "
"7838260","7840200"," 230 point gain in the hour."
"7840580","7845380"," About a 40 handle gain in the S&P at 4196, pushing back towards a 4200 mark."
"7846200","7849040"," We're a little less than 24 hours now from the F1C rate decision. "
"7849300","7852560"," The U.S. 10-year yield after briefly topping 3% off yesterday."
"7852860","7855320"," And today, head of U.S. cash equity open."
"7855540","7858680"," We're at 293 down about five from where we closed yesterday. "
"7858680","7861920"," The 210 spread holding around 25 basis points."
"7862720","7863680"," Beautiful little saying."
"7863680","7866460"," Dollar hooks are going to be lower down about a quarter of a percent. "
"7866720","7868840"," Group futures are down about one and a third percent."
"7869140","7870100"," The old baby arm hook."
"7873220","7876840"," The VIX at 3543 down about 6%. "
"7877880","7878660"," Beautiful low."
"7878840","7882960"," We could measure this, but probably tell you it's probably going to go right here at 419 or 420."
"7887460","7888300"," We don't need to measure it. "
"7888340","7888760"," It's going to 420."
"7889460","7894660"," More commentary from potash management saying the expected will take up to four years for potash"
"7894660","7896200"," deficit to catch up with demand."
"7901200","7901980"," That all this time. "
"7902680","7903340"," Damn it."
"7905880","7907180"," Go sit down, Benny."
"7926680","7932360"," As we trade towards 419 or so or 420, we're going to look to see if these sellers are strong"
"7932840","7933880"," or if they're weak. "
"7934180","7935340"," So here's the rest of it."
"7935340","7940720"," So as we trade up here, this is what you're looking for if you're trading this market, right?"
"7942400","7946360"," You're looking to find out, well, first of all, you're looking to find out how high can I take this"
"7946360","7947540"," before I take my money and run."
"7948800","7952260"," Second thing you're looking for is do these sellers get pushed higher, right?"
"7952340","7955920"," If we come up here and they push themselves up to 421 or 422. "
"7957480","7960480"," So before you take your profit here, you're looking to see if they're pushed higher."
"7961580","7965400"," The third thing you're looking for is if they're not being pushed higher, they're meeting you here"
"7965400","7966020"," to reject."
"7968330","7970230"," So as we trade up here, right?"
"7970350","7977350"," We're trading up to 419.50. We're going to be looking for our waves of sellers coming down. "
"7977690","7983110"," If there aren't and the bulls are pushing up, you'll actually see the resistance trade higher."
"7983570","7986270"," You'll start to see these red lines come into play."
"7986750","7988450"," Let's say above here now to 420. "
"7988450","7990370"," They were at 420 just a moment ago."
"7990370","7992270"," Now they're above at 421."
"7992710","7999810"," So if you're able to push the sellers back and not have them come sweeping in, you can hold your"
"7999810","8002810"," long position to break through resistance. "
"8003890","8005090"," Right now it's about even even."
"8005930","8009190"," Right now top looks like what we were calling it, right?"
"8009450","8010610"," 419.50. 420."
"8011490","8012310"," Somewhere in here. "
"8012750","8014730"," We're going to wait and see if you can see them."
"8014850","8018310"," Now you're seeing 130s and 120s and 110s."
"8018310","8020890"," They're putting up a fight as we get up to this resistance. "
"8022430","8025070"," Now do I think we're going to 419.50 or 420?"
"8025390","8026030"," More than likely."
"8027330","8028990"," Do I think we're breaking past 420?"
"8029110","8029950"," Probably not."
"8031130","8035450"," If we could trade higher, 420.50, we could push the bears back a little bit more. "
"8036070","8036990"," 422 or so."
"8037950","8041130"," But even if we get up here, there's a lot of resistance to us."
"8041510","8046210"," This is that whole thing that we talked about is the escape velocity that we need. "
"8046210","8052230"," We need to have some fed decisions, some fed pressers for an escape velocity type event."
"8052870","8057990"," And there's also no, there's no reason you might not own the market, but there are huge hedge"
"8057990","8061010"," funds, huge banks that own the market."
"8061190","8061990"," They own the spy. "
"8062790","8063870"," They own tons of it."
"8064250","8067990"," So they're going to leave those protection on, heading into tomorrow."
"8068630","8071070"," In case they don't care, they've had them on the entire time. "
"8071450","8073810"," They'll hold them to the event."
"8073810","8076390"," In case there is a market break."
"8077370","8079990"," That's why they hold them to protect themselves. "
"8080450","8082770"," They can sell their stock at 400 if we crash through it."
"8083010","8087230"," They can monetize the puts and their shorts that they have on the market."
"8089770","8092510"," In case there's bad news. "
"8093030","8096410"," So as a bull, you're not going to do this escape velocity."
"8097210","8101790"," Like as a day trader, you're not going to get out of this until something leaks."
"8102870","8107630"," Or if in case something leaks, some news that we don't know that they know. "
"8108350","8110310"," Or there's bad news or good news."
"8113980","8117000"," Don't worry too much about this trip falling off here."
"8117420","8119060"," You've got to cut more opportunities down. "
"8119280","8121460"," You've got A, you've got B down here."
"8122980","8125320"," To add to your position, then you've got C down here."
"8135000","8137840"," Then you'll see your buyers right here, 416-80. "
"8138020","8138820"," There are buyers there."
"8145220","8149700"," You've got, you're being led lower somewhat with this 415-414-50."
"8153780","8155240"," But you're still on support here. "
"8211190","8212270"," Daven hands, bulls."
"8217620","8218420"," Shit, hold up."
"8218879","8219100"," Where's that?"
"8237820","8239500"," There goes your VW out coming up now. "
"8248490","8249730"," Bears are getting old."
"8250090","8251150"," Oh yeah, it breaks the board, baby."
"8251950","8253110"," This is death now. "
"8255129","8257030"," Bears want to see a huge break here."
"8270400","8271240"," Man, that's ugly."
"8271379","8272600"," I wouldn't have gotten a guy caught in that. "
"8272680","8274180"," I'm not in no trades at all today right now."
"8277730","8279770"," I'm waiting to place a pretty substantial trade."
"8292600","8294540"," Pounce it around on V-Wap down here. "
"8300100","8301580"," You can see that all these dips are bought."
"8301920","8303379"," One dip, two dips, three dips."
"8304219","8305639"," Coming into some V-Wap here. "
"8306139","8307020"," Then done right down below."
"8307280","8308740"," This is the rest of that V-Wap down here."
"8310639","8312020"," We'll see if this V gets bought. "
"8313000","8318240"," If this V doesn't get bought, you would see you would hope that you'd get that V-Wap buy to"
"8318240","8319020"," keep the day bullish."
"8320059","8324120"," It doesn't turn bearish until we break through that support here."
"8324340","8326520"," Then you'd want one, two, bam. "
"8326959","8330000"," If you're a bear, that's what you're looking for."
"8331120","8334280"," If you're a bear, you're looking for a break of support."
"8336160","8336639"," Right?"
"8337840","8340780"," You want to see the bulls just hoping and begging is coming back. "
"8341100","8345860"," Rejection, one, two, and then that's where you pick this up if you're a bear."
"8349090","8354740"," You want some confirmation, and then we'll take that down to 410."
"8361080","8363059"," Otherwise, this is just dip buying for bulls. "
"8363799","8368200"," If your trap is a bull right now and you're all scared out there, you're like, oh no, cap, I'm"
"8368200","8369240"," getting fucked up right now."
"8369920","8371200"," More than likely you'll have a chance."
"8371559","8376299"," It's still a bull's contact, so more than likely, you'll have at least one more chance to get out"
"8376299","8377820"," if you're then turning bearish. "
"8379900","8382120"," I wouldn't, personally, I wouldn't sell."
"8382120","8383740"," I'm not recommending this, not financial advice."
"8384719","8391580"," But if I was bullish here and I'm scared now, I wouldn't like scare sell down here or even down"
"8391580","8391920"," here. "
"8392040","8394180"," I'd be waiting for at least one more pull up higher."
"8395100","8399160"," For at least one more here, then you can cut your shit loose and get out of there."
"8401740","8403620"," Wrong place normally to be selling. "
"8404000","8405060"," Normally, not always."
"8406420","8408280"," Normally, wrong place to be selling after bullish."
"8409640","8412760"," We already said down below that stop losses are down here, right?"
"8412760","8414880"," Our stops are down here for bulls. "
"8415660","8418260"," Bears already know this, just so you know."
"8418540","8423260"," Bears know that if they take it down here, you're more than likely going to cut your losses and"
"8423260","8424620"," then they'll come back up screaming higher."
"8425900","8426840"," So make sure your stops. "
"8427120","8428440"," Make sure you're counting for that down here."
"8428820","8432100"," If you're a bear, that's the same thing, right?"
"8432260","8434980"," They could trade it down here, cut the stops, and then they run it up again."
"8436100","8442880"," So bears want to be looking for the sell to trigger stop losses, to rejection, confirmation, boom"
"8442880","8443220"," down. "
"8450430","8451830"," Fools, you know, it gets down here."
"8451930","8452690"," Yes, they did the same thing."
"8453050","8453950"," We traded this. "
"8454110","8455010"," I treated this yesterday."
"8455270","8457950"," Think about it like 13 cents or something."
"8459010","8460510"," They came down to five cents. "
"8462110","8462950"," So what did I do?"
"8463110","8465310"," I fucking kept loading the fucking boat down here."
"8466190","8467150"," I was like, oh, five cents?"
"8467230","8467510"," Fuck it."
"8467550","8468210"," Let's throw them in there. "
"8468690","8471710"," Fucking nice dope average cost."
"8472210","8473230"," And then we went to the fucking moon."
"8473930","8475190"," Like literal fucking moon. "
"8475750","8477170"," 60 cent fucking calls."
"8477870","8479810"," Well, they were like 35, I think."
"8479930","8481810"," And then I went back in and they went to 60 or something. "
"8482370","8483410"," Kind of nonsense like that."
"8485620","8487000"," We're not supposed to be conscious of this."
"8487160","8488280"," This though, this setup at least. "
"8489100","8490580"," If you're like, no cap, we ain't going any higher."
"8491060","8492260"," I just want to take money and run cap."
"8492800","8495180"," There's not a place to be caught in your losses here, or even here. "
"8495780","8498600"," Be somewhere down here or a rip higher."
"8500380","8503280"," Either here or down here so you can save your ass."
"8504600","8506040"," If you're like, okay cap. "
"8507860","8509220"," We traded down here."
"8509300","8510480"," We never got high enough to be down."
"8510640","8511000"," Fuck myself. "
"8511460","8512460"," We traded straight down."
"8514000","8514400"," Right?"
"8514640","8515560"," And we trade down here."
"8516280","8517360"," You can add to your position. "
"8519080","8519480"," Right?"
"8520040","8525900"," And if we stop, if we don't actually blast the forth, if we just stop right here, that would be"
"8525900","8527240"," the time to be like fucking them out."
"8527940","8529120"," Because more than likely going to do this."
"8532660","8535640"," And you don't always win these, but you want to manage your trade. "
"8535840","8535980"," Right?"
"8536540","8538220"," If you're trading this, you're bought here."
"8538820","8539580"," You're bought here."
"8539840","8540560"," You're bought here. "
"8540860","8543100"," You take this move down here."
"8543400","8544500"," And you're still in long."
"8545560","8547680"," There are places for you to manage your trade. "
"8549260","8551080"," Even if you're back to where you started."
"8552740","8555840"," And if you do this enough, eventually it'll take your money and run up here."
"8556840","8560200"," But if you don't, then you're trying to get unfucked. "
"8562060","8562660"," Don't ever."
"8562660","8564300"," Or I shouldn't say don't."
"8564340","8565720"," I shouldn't say you should do this. "
"8565900","8569160"," But day traders won't sell this."
"8569840","8570760"," Just move down."
"8571440","8572700"," Don't dive in hand this shit. "
"8573540","8575240"," And they'll even dive in hand this down here."
"8576040","8579200"," And they won't actually sell until there's some rejection down here."
"8581550","8582930"," For a loss, believe it or not. "
"8583050","8583350"," Not much."
"8583590","8585970"," Usually it's only like 10, 20% of this whole move."
"8586290","8589590"," Even though you lost probably fucking 150% or something. "
"8592890","8596350"," But just as you manage your trades, don't ever capitulate."
"8596350","8597070"," Sell this shit."
"8597350","8597710"," Ever. "
"8598890","8602290"," You'll win more than you have all the losses that you have out there."
"8603010","8605970"," You'll win more of these than just selling every time."
"8606250","8608390"," Every time you have some shit like this happen, think about this. "
"8609150","8611870"," Every time you have some shit like bullshit like this happen."
"8612610","8614050"," And you're like fuck, I made a mistake."
"8615250","8616950"," Think about it if you just sold there. "
"8618010","8624170"," If you just recovered three or four of those that blasted off, it would cover the losses on the"
"8624170","8627350"," seven that you lose 10, 20, 30% on down here."
"8627750","8632010"," You're at least breaking even if you're a theory that we're going high, it didn't work."
"8632470","8635270"," So, manage your losses as well as another key point. "
"8635990","8644140"," Now, with that said, if we break here and we don't get this, move for this."
"8644320","8646560"," Move for you to get out and fuck yourself."
"8647320","8648880"," If you don't get that, right?"
"8649240","8650500"," Don't be doing this stupid shit either. "
"8650500","8651320"," We come down here."
"8651620","8652220"," We fail."
"8652480","8656660"," You didn't take your losses and run or break even and run. "
"8657560","8657860"," Right?"
"8658080","8658720"," We do this here."
"8659000","8660580"," And if you see this right here, right?"
"8661100","8664900"," If you start to see this move right here, don't be like, I'm going to fucking add to it down"
"8664900","8664900"," here."
"8664900","8666720"," I'm going to be sent to a bank of VR saying that. "
"8666920","8668220"," I'm pushing up inflation."
"8669260","8669660"," Columbia."
"8672340","8674620"," And wait for the next setup to go long. "
"8677140","8677900"," Does that work?"
"8678120","8678960"," Does that help any of you out there?"
"8683070","8684430"," Yeah, I don't trade on Webull."
"8685250","8685690"," Ever."
"8686410","8687550"," They just have really fast charts. "
"8690180","8691900"," I never, I never trade on Webull."
"8692300","8692640"," Ever."
"8692820","8693760"," You can see right here and log in. "
"8694060","8694700"," I don't trade on this shit."
"8695360","8696780"," Webull is fucking for new traders."
"8697720","8700020"," I use it because it's pre-fast charts. "
"8700940","8703240"," They're the fastest charts, to be honest with you."
"8704120","8710660"," I don't, you, you, you, so on your own screeners at home, pull your charts out and put them side "
"8710660","8711640","-by-side to Webull chart."
"8711640","8715460"," I may be Ninja traders, probably a millisecond faster. "
"8718330","8719390"," Maybe a millisecond."
"8720630","8727350"," And the difference between this chart and this chart, if you want to see something cool, if you"
"8727350","8729850"," guys want to see something cool, I'll show you something cool."
"8734120","8736660"," Let me see if I can, wait a minute. "
"8740560","8746420"," You want to see something neat."
"8747160","8749000"," So, there's a slight difference."
"8749720","8753220"," If you're ever on your charts at home, there's another neat little thing you guys don't tell you"
"8753220","8753600"," guys about. "
"8755640","8759800"," So, so on your, on your chart, whatever chart you use at home, right?"
"8762610","8763790"," I don't know, it's not showing it here."
"8764250","8766050"," On your charts at home, it's hard to explain."
"8767930","8768790"," God damn it. "
"8772090","8773430"," On your charts at home, right?"
"8774230","8775330"," See this price, not this price."
"8775550","8777190"," See the real price right here of this blue thing?"
"8777190","8779070"," 416-64."
"8782020","8790160"," This real price right here will not match up to the price over on this book map. "
"8792910","8800030"," And what's really fascinating about that is you can see when we're topping, you can see that"
"8800030","8804910"," there's either a more of a bit or less of a bit."
"8804910","8810490"," So, let's say, let's say, let's say we're trading up here for, let's say we're trading where we"
"8810490","8811530"," are, 416-39."
"8813850","8818150"," On your real chart, let's say the real chart showing 416-50. "
"8819310","8822590"," It means that they're trying to buy at lower prices."
"8823570","8832330"," If you see the real price at 416-38 right now, or they're at 443 right now, let's say that"
"8832330","8837210"," this price is at 43 and the real price is lower."
"8838030","8839490"," It means that they're bidding it up. "
"8839690","8840170"," Does that make sense?"
"8840790","8846430"," So, this price on book map is showing you if they're bidding it up or if they're pulling their bid"
"8846430","8846730"," back."
"8847410","8849730"," So, if you're watching the price right now, it's 416-50."
"8849830","8852550"," On the chart, it's 416-60, right?"
"8852770","8854690"," It's showing that they're actually buying it right now. "
"8855030","8855450"," Does that make sense?"
"8855450","8865370"," The discrepancy between the buy sell price and the physical chart price that"
"8865370","8865670"," you get."
"8872680","8875540"," Well, I can do my trading here on book map."
"8875800","8879560"," I can actually place trades here in book map, but I just choose not to. "
"8879840","8886960"," I trade, I've been trading so long that I've got fucking, I've got like think or swim, I've got"
"8886960","8892360"," weebel, I've got, oh, well, whatever the fuck it is, I've got fucking tasty works."
"8892640","8897720"," I got like, in each one of those platforms does something better than the other."
"8898340","8901660"," So, like think or swim has got some fucking thick-ass shit. "
"8902760","8906440"," Tasty works has some really nice, for me, great execution."
"8906700","8910420"," Welcome to Columbia Central Banker VR saying that the economy has grown much faster than expected."
"8911060","8916780"," One of my favorite parts about think or swim, believe it or not of anything else, is the customer"
"8916780","8918420"," services next to none for me. "
"8919060","8924300"," Any customer service I've ever had, think or swim, or tasty is the best."
"8924760","8927280"," When I call tasty, they answer the fucking phone."
"8927960","8931300"," If anything fucked up happens, they fix that shit. "
"8932000","8933120"," Anything fucked up."
"8933720","8937860"," Like anything, like a guy on the phone immediately."
"8938800","8939460"," What's going on?"
"8939680","8940060"," What's happening?"
"8940460","8940780"," What happened?"
"8941500","8942240"," How do I fix that?"
"8943360","8944340"," You know, what happened?"
"8944340","8945340"," Then they go back and review. "
"8945500","8947000"," They actually record your trading session."
"8948840","8950340"," Actually, they actually record everything."
"8950980","8954620"," I think they have to because they go back and review it and say, okay, no problem. "
"8954620","8955280"," I see what you're saying."
"8955760","8956780"," And they fix it for you."
"8957120","8958900"," So, all customer service out there. "
"8960440","8963320"," Tasty, for me at least, has been my best experience."
"8973320","8975560"," Yeah, the dome is fucking horrible."
"8976300","8977600"," This is the best dome out there. "
"8977720","8978560"," This is as good as it gets."
"8978560","8980720"," This is as good as anyone else that does it."
"8981240","8985000"," Ninjas, a few others, but this is as good as any. "
"8985140","8986240"," This is people pay for this."
"8986440","8988500"," Some professionals use a book map."
"8990220","8993280"," I don't use the free version of a book map on Thinkorswim. "
"8998000","9001000"," But book map, so I'm kind of like a bastard child."
"9001180","9003300"," And that guy that's got like 10 fucking screeners open."
"9003560","9006760"," I've got, you know, news pumping over here. "
"9006760","9008420"," I've got verbal news over here."
"9008540","9009360"," I've got book map on."
"9009500","9011700"," I've got options flow in the background. "
"9011780","9014020"," This is a prime example right here when I say something."
"9014440","9015740"," Before it even happened, okay?"
"9016520","9017780"," What's happening right here?"
"9018700","9022720"," So, if you had been in here and you panic sold, right?"
"9022980","9026380"," Now you're sitting here holding your dick out there and you're going, fuck."
"9027260","9030020"," I could have at least unfucked myself up here. "
"9030940","9031160"," Right?"
"9032040","9032760"," Does that make sense?"
"9033820","9034600"," Or fuck?"
"9034600","9038220"," I could have, I could have diamond handed that shit."
"9038800","9038940"," Right?"
"9039660","9040140"," Added."
"9040700","9044380"," And then it probably would have been break even at least here to get untunned fuck myself. "
"9045100","9046440"," Does that make sense at all?"
"9046780","9051260"," And if you lose, if you start losing the trade, how you can unfuck yourself?"
"9052040","9054820"," And there probably are traders down here that bought this dip."
"9055460","9057700"," And they're now probably where they were up here."
"9059220","9059700"," Right?"
"9059840","9061200"," They're dollar cost averaging or whatever. "
"9061200","9063500"," And the fucking stock bulls say."
"9064880","9068620"," And so you kind of, you're kind of, you're kind of at least unfucking yourself at this point."
"9071930","9072590"," So there you go. "
"9072690","9073610"," There's a lesson for the day."
"9082630","9083030"," Yeah."
"9083190","9084930"," The data is not good on book map either. "
"9085010","9086870"," And I don't think it tracks all tickers."
"9087490","9088410"," It's not the same."
"9088670","9091170"," The book map on Thinkorswim is not the same as book map. "
"9091470","9092470"," Just so you all know out there."
"9092510","9092950"," It's not the same."
"9093330","9094810"," And it's not the DX feed either. "
"9095050","9099550"," The DX feed pulls from, the DX feed pulls information from three."
"9099550","9101450"," I think it's three U.S. or domestic."
"9107500","9108680"," Like, damn it. "
"9110120","9111280"," Forget the word for it."
"9111820","9113600"," Kind of brain shit right now."
"9114680","9118560"," It's like pulls data from like CME that are from the New York Stock Exchange. "
"9119320","9120140"," From three different exchanges."
"9121040","9122180"," I think they only use one exchange."
"9123040","9126140"," Don't quote me on this, but I think that they only use one exchange in Thinkorswim. "
"9126400","9127900"," I think you're limited on liquidity."
"9128480","9130060"," I think you're limited on."
"9130180","9132720"," I don't know if you can put the heroin indicator on there or not. "
"9132840","9133460"," You may be able to."
"9134220","9135980"," There's some real quirks with it."
"9136500","9137700"," It's not inferior. "
"9138020","9138620"," It's a good product."
"9139240","9140460"," But it's not what this is."
"9141020","9141620"," They're different things. "
"9145600","9149120"," So we did unfuck yourself from your position at this point."
"9149320","9153800"," If you listen to me, you unfuck yourself from up here."
"9154220","9155640"," Where do we go to next is the question. "
"9157460","9158820"," This is never good to see."
"9158820","9159740"," You don't want to see."
"9160320","9162020"," You don't want to see this right here. "
"9162100","9166100"," We could go up from here, but I don't ever like seeing this here because this starts to show me"
"9166100","9166700"," a rollover."
"9167700","9170520"," It starts to show me that bulls are like, oh shit, I got caught."
"9171340","9172300"," And now I just want out. "
"9173060","9175060"," Be careful of these moves like this."
"9175720","9183500"," I personally prefer to see a preference is to see a failure and a straight dropdown and then a"
"9183500","9184060"," blast off."
"9184900","9185320"," Personally. "
"9186320","9187300"," We might go up here."
"9187820","9189200"," But that's my personal preference."
"9190840","9192520"," That strength I like to see. "
"9192900","9193780"," Fuck you, we're going up."
"9196680","9198860"," This here, I'm always afraid of it, right?"
"9199200","9203860"," I'm always afraid of like the quick jump and then it's a trap when we go down."
"9205000","9206420"," Just be careful of this right here. "
"9206720","9207720"," I'm not saying we ain't going up here."
"9207820","9209540"," Just be careful of it if you're a bull and you're long here."
"9211100","9212380"," Not my favorite setup. "
"9213420","9213880"," Good setup."
"9214160","9214600"," Not my favorite."
"9216960","9219980"," We'll look here and see if the bulls or bears are in charge. "
"9220700","9222900"," Looks like, looks like 419 still in the table."
"9223980","9225980"," I don't see why we don't get up there, but just be careful."
"9226720","9230760"," One other thing to know is forget the bears being up here. "
"9231140","9232960"," There's some panic and bulls being up here as well."
"9233600","9235520"," And so just I'll leave you with that one last point."
"9236520","9237860"," Bulls know what to sell at 420. "
"9238460","9239180"," Not just me."
"9240100","9242000"," A whole shit tied out there in trader land."
"9246340","9248800"," So you could get some distribution coming up here in just a bit. "
"9266750","9268410"," Okay, you can take this trade as a bear."
"9268590","9269370"," It's just not ideal."
"9270950","9273570"," So where we are right with this setup is right here. "
"9273610","9274710"," We could still blast off."
"9274850","9275870"," It's not ideal for a bear."
"9276130","9277590"," The ideal bear setup here. "
"9277790","9278470"," Believe it or not, right?"
"9279050","9280750"," This is a good bear setup right here."
"9281770","9283470"," It's starting to get better for a bear."
"9284330","9285130"," Not guaranteed. "
"9285650","9286850"," I still like this 419."
"9287450","9290530"," The fact that these sellers are waiting up here is still like it."
"9290630","9293250"," That means bears know that we could still come up here. "
"9293530","9297770"," But even with all that said, where we are in the market right now at this moment, I still don't"
"9297770","9298470"," like even this."
"9299150","9299870"," I don't like bears."
"9300170","9303710"," If you're a bear and you take this trade, you're going to lose probably 50% of them. "
"9305010","9306870"," You know what you're not going to lose 50% of?"
"9307630","9313810"," If you get a rollover in confirmation here, you're fucking these right here are power moves for"
"9313810","9313970"," bears."
"9314790","9319330"," If you look for these setups, and if you find them, these are power moves."
"9320350","9323670"," This one right here where the dip is bought, it's rejected. "
"9325210","9327270"," And then you get that confirmation, you take it down."
"9327410","9328190"," This one right here is nasty."
"9329170","9330450"," That's some fucked up shit right there. "
"9334010","9336290"," So I'm not quite bearish here, but I'm not bullish."
"9336470","9337730"," I'm like neutral at this point."
"9341300","9342600"," This is digital in the middle. "
"9343480","9346480"," Mr. Yen, when he used to say this stuff, I used to watch him."
"9346480","9347920"," We'll ask him for re-fucking years."
"9348500","9349680"," This is digital in the middle. "
"9350220","9351780"," Don't fuck around with this right here."
"9353120","9360260"," And if anything, if you're a bro, if you got this opportunity, take your money and run and wait for"
"9360260","9362520"," more support down here to run this up."
"9368960","9372900"," This is not what you want to be on either side of that trade personally. "
"9376700","9377420"," Take a look here."
"9377520","9378400"," Sports still here too."
"9379140","9379980"," You can see it down below. "
"9380120","9380540"," It's still here."
"9381780","9389100"," It's down here at 4.15.05. 4.16.14. You're going to be looking for, if you're a bull,"
"9390120","9395900"," you can start looking to see if there's some fake orders coming down here and drag it, start"
"9395900","9396600"," dragging it down."
"9397200","9397740"," There's some spoofing. "
"9398520","9399540"," I'm not seeing any of that yet."
"9400220","9402700"," You can see some real strong strength down here at 4.16, right?"
"9403880","9406220"," Again at 4.15.20. Pretty good strength."
"9406640","9408040"," I got to give it to the bull so far. "
"9408880","9411180"," It's neutral, but it's bulls are still kind of in charge."
"9427030","9431170"," Still watching dip buyers coming in on the market as well on equities."
"9431170","9432830"," Or not equities on indexes ETF. "
"9463610","9468730"," I missed that news on Apple hires 31 year Ford veteran to ramp up its car project."
"9469490","9471530"," Lots of bullish news in the market today."
"9480540","9483480"," 10 years still down 5 VPS in the day. "
"9484220","9486140"," But still getting close to that three again."
"9517640","9520440"," Starting to look like some distribution for middle of the afternoon."
"9520440","9521780"," I'm going to take a break here. "
"9522160","9524300"," I think we're getting some distribution in here."
"9526540","9529320"," It looks like some distribution going on."
"9530200","9531440"," Not totally bearish here yet. "
"9532920","9534100"," Some kind of a grind."
"9540450","9547410"," I think Kenneth Rogers is saying that Kenneth extraordinary actions were not taken to help the"
"9547410","9554830"," commercial banks or fund the government spending saying they are acutely aware that some people are"
"9554830","9559710"," questioning trust in the central bank given some of their extraordinary actions taken during the"
"9559710","9560230"," pandemic."
"9560730","9564170"," There's some things that we got wrong at BOC says Rogers. "
"9564810","9570070"," If you're a bull, you were surprised by the intensity and persistence of supply chain disruptions."
"9570750","9571670"," Is what you're looking to hold."
"9572490","9573190"," If you're a bear. "
"9573610","9578270"," I also did not see for see how the invasion of Ukraine would push up commodity prices."
"9580920","9582720"," This is your signal down here."
"9582720","9588080"," These Rogers on the job market saying they're almost twice as many vacant jobs as there were before"
"9588080","9588800"," the pandemic. "
"9592680","9596660"," They'll be watching closely how the economy responds to higher rates in Canada."
"9598880","9600520"," Rates will need to rise further."
"9602000","9603780"," But says BOC is not on autopilot. "
"9607230","9608850"," So you're looking for this is it right here."
"9609550","9611290"," Right in here is what you're looking for."
"9611610","9612730"," Does that work better?"
"9613050","9614530"," Is that a better demonstration?"
"9616550","9618190"," You can keep all this in here. "
"9618190","9618890"," This is all BOC."
"9619310","9620910"," The moment you bounce down in here."
"9621090","9623710"," This is your, this is your do or die right here. "
"9623810","9624790"," This is the decision time."
"9625290","9626490"," There's no bank against Rogers."
"9626990","9633670"," Not mentioning the bank acting forcefully if needed to reign in inflation as some of our colleagues"
"9633670","9634810"," have gone into some speeches. "
"9636030","9638270"," Feels like we should touch for 10 at some point today."
"9638410","9639730"," Maybe four or five of these days tomorrow."
"9640170","9641450"," Oh yeah, that's what I'm doing. "
"9642330","9643210"," I'm waiting brother."
"9646600","9652440"," From Rogers saying with inflation running close to 7% and spreading to more everyday items, it is"
"9652440","9653680"," squeezing family budgets."
"9655060","9656120"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"9656400","9658380"," I'm looking for that dip by baby."
"9660750","9662070"," I'm looking for that dip by."
"9663070","9664430"," There is one thing to be said. "
"9664610","9666610"," If you are a bull up there, you guys want to get bullish."
"9668450","9669410"," We can get bullish."
"9673210","9674190"," There's R1 up here. "
"9674770","9677370"," There's an attempt right now to turn this into S1."
"9681050","9687490"," If you can, if bulls can maintain this, this resistance turns into support."
"9691750","9693550"," Believe it or not, this 415 turns support. "
"9694010","9695430"," And you can then start to look out at 425."
"9698100","9699140"," You make this R1 up here."
"9700580","9703800"," Establishing some time in here is good for bulls. "
"9705060","9708500"," If bulls don't give this up today, it's a good sign for bulls."
"9710040","9712340"," This is healthy for bulls to maintain this."
"9712760","9714180"," They don't want to give this up today. "
"9727260","9728440"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"9728620","9729600"," I'll be back in about a half an hour."
"9730100","9731020"," I'll try the news will be on. "
"9731760","9733800"," This is going to look kind of boring to me at least."
"9735300","9739240"," If you're a bull and you're in this to win it, 420 is your price target."
"9740360","9741840"," You can see down here. "
"9742220","9747800"," I just drew out for you what you're looking for for patterns to stay in this game or to exit"
"9747800","9748380"," this game."
"9749200","9750820"," This should be clear as day for you."
"9752120","9753820"," My take is still the same. "
"9753960","9758240"," I haven't changed my take and that would be even with this app price action today."
"9758520","9760300"," We talked about coming up here and touching 420."
"9760960","9767280"," I'm going to be looking for consolidation down into more news out of FOMC or a leak of some kind"
"9767280","9769080"," or the presser tomorrow. "
"9769980","9779180"," And of course, I have lots of interest in the expiry tomorrow and buying that expiry."
"9783590","9788830"," Be careful as we come in here too because there could be some fair and panic taking profits."
"9789950","9791710"," You've got what's called a runway over here. "
"9792270","9793610"," You always like calling this a runway."
"9796340","9797880"," You get the runway like you get an airplane."
"9798720","9805300"," And as it runs out, as time passes, you're cutting off that runway and never like seeing runway run"
"9805300","9806520"," out of a non-opec today. "
"9807880","9808620"," Not always."
"9808760","9811340"," It only gives you less room to go higher."
"9811980","9814420"," You start to have to make it steeper as time goes on. "
"9815380","9819720"," Your runway has to be like this to get where you want to be."
"9820120","9822160"," So, I never like when the runway runs out to the course of the day."
"9822420","9827100"," Sometimes, especially with FOMC, you might start to see people panic sell and say, oh shit, I don't"
"9827100","9830540"," have enough time to get where I need to be to make profit here. "
"9831720","9833520"," I always consider that kind of stuff."
"9837020","9845520"," WCO commenting that 18 member states have notified the WCO food export restrictions and say they're"
"9845520","9847140"," seriously worried about prices."
"9851400","9858440"," WCO officials saying that they need to find ways to evacuate grains from Ukraine before the harvest"
"9858440","9861080"," to help global food security. "
"9861820","9865160"," Also, look at this resistance, right?"
"9869000","9873720"," And now you're down below it and you're trying to not get rejected, right?"
"9875400","9877920"," On a larger time frame, that's what we're looking at, right?"
"9878280","9882980"," This is the same setup as we're on in a smaller time frame, right?"
"9884400","9887940"," Bears want to control this to maintain the narrative down."
"9899680","9901860"," What do you need to break through that 420?"
"9906560","9907000"," I'll be right back."
"9929950","9931450"," I see you out there, Mero. "
"9931650","9932150"," How you doing, brother?"
"9933330","9934250"," Good to see you, man."
"9934450","9936430"," I didn't see you in the chat until just now."
"9936750","9938190"," I'm popping back on, my brother. "
"9938370","9938730"," How are you?"
"9938910","9940130"," You might start to look weird."
"9941770","9945870"," I always love when Mero is fucking in here."
"9946410","9948610"," Talking fucking day trader stuff to people in here. "
"9948730","9952730"," Mero, this guy Mero that's in here with us right now, ganks her day trader."
"9953110","9953590"," Globex trader."
"9955390","9961090"," It's probably in here trying to fucking, trying to fucking find out what the person who he fucking,"
"9961630","9964710"," what the bulls are thinking here. "
"9965710","9967490"," We'll make this a Mero chart."
"9969090","9973910"," I just made this a, we were on this earlier, but we'll make this."
"9974070","9975630"," Do that nice little bull flag right here. "
"9977210","9978990"," Do that bull flag foreman."
"9979550","9981190"," Get that big bull flag Mero."
"9981850","9982370"," Bam. "
"9982850","9982950"," ABC."
"9984550","9985650"," Rocket ship up to 420."
"9987490","9988610"," Fucking love Mero. "
"9989970","9991790"," There it is right there for the bull flag."
"9993390","9994710"," I didn't know you were in here, Mero."
"9996350","9997630"," I didn't fucking see you, bro. "
"10003680","10005200"," Good to see you, man."
"10005360","10005680"," How you doing?"
"10006140","10006840"," Are you losing money?"
"10008080","10008800"," Are you serious?"
"10010780","10011760"," What's going on, Mero?"
"10014530","10015970"," What do you mean you're losing all kinds of money?"
"10016070","10017070"," I don't believe you for a minute."
"10017410","10018490"," You're losing all kinds of money. "
"10019370","10021030"," I don't believe that for a fucking second."
"10022670","10025030"," I think you're one of the best pocket traders out there."
"10025110","10025790"," I think you know exactly. "
"10026110","10032190"," So Mero, I always try to watch Mero because Mero always knows where the tops and bottoms are,"
"10032730","10034870"," especially in larger trades like big moves."
"10036910","10038870"," He wants the Mero wants the short it."
"10040630","10041850"," Where's the short Mero?"
"10042110","10043030"," You know where it is, right?"
"10043550","10044050"," It's up here. "
"10047700","10048900"," We know that's the short."
"10051640","10054460"," And we also know that we don't know if this is a real bull flag."
"10054600","10055500"," I don't think it is. "
"10057340","10058980"," I think we have a date with 410."
"10061780","10066740"," I think by end of day we're going to be down here and you're going to get, you know, you"
"10066740","10068260"," get that fucking bleed off down here."
"10069700","10071100"," And you're going to stay at four o'clock. "
"10071160","10071820"," You're going to go, fuck."
"10072900","10073940"," You're going to go, I knew it."
"10074380","10076000"," Why did I, or why did I forget?"
"10077160","10079000"," Everybody's going to be freaked out in FOMC. "
"10079140","10080800"," There's no reason to be freaked out in FOMC."
"10083040","10086860"," That's me personally, but you know the bulls."
"10087140","10088200"," They always think they got a chance. "
"10095020","10097960"," You know that the bulls are thinking, I got this."
"10098800","10100040"," Escape velocity incoming."
"10101020","10101400"," No. "
"10102840","10105720"," You need, you need the protection off the fucking market."
"10110080","10114280"," These fucking bears push you down once, twice, three, four."
"10115000","10116040"," Now they broke below. "
"10118330","10120590"," In a larger time frame, you're trying to break through."
"10121490","10122450"," Bears like fuck you, buddy."
"10122670","10123470"," You're going to wait till tomorrow. "
"10123890","10125870"," And then we're going to decide if we're going up and we're going down."
"10126670","10127470"," That's what they're saying."
"10127610","10129010"," Or at least unless there's a leak or something. "
"10129450","10130410"," I don't think we're going down though."
"10131410","10133830"," I don't think, I don't think we're going down, bro."
"10134070","10135690"," I think we're going to like 4,000. "
"10137130","10137890"," Best case."
"10151820","10153400"," Just close your eyes in short."
"10153880","10154220"," Fucking amen. "
"10155680","10156840"," Good to see you, Barrow."
"10157760","10158400"," Hope all is well, brother."
"10163960","10166140"," Yeah, that's what my thought is. "
"10167680","10169360"," Nice little five-day chart right here."
"10173790","10175070"," It's a nice little bounce down here."
"10175290","10175430"," Bam. "
"10179440","10180040"," Just like that."
"10181240","10181900"," Something like that."
"10182020","10182560"," Something like that. "
"10186260","10193670"," Get all these fucking fools in here, FOMO, and I'll buy that down there somewhere."
"10194650","10198390"," And all these fucked up FOMO bulls are going to rocket ship me up here."
"10200630","10207210"," And I'll be fucking, I'll be fucking fucking, fucking printing 12,000%. "
"10207610","10210190"," All these fucking FOMO bulls will be like, I need to get up here."
"10210330","10211170"," And I'll be like, oh, no worries."
"10211430","10211890"," Here's my bags. "
"10212030","10212650"," You can have them."
"10215810","10218210"," Good luck."
"10229110","10230070"," Have fun. "
"10232570","10233850"," Come here, young strap and lad."
"10234390","10234830"," Come here, son."
"10235510","10236630"," Are you having fun yet, son?"
"10242840","10244180"," All right, I'll be back. "
"10249620","10250920"," It's so fucked up, too."
"10253100","10254020"," It's so fucked up."
"10262510","10263110"," All right. "
"10263310","10263750"," So I'll be back."
"10263750","10265310"," I've been taking a quick break."
"10265330","10268110"," I said I was going to take a break like a 12.30. It's 12.42. I'm taking a break"
"10268110","10268770"," to one o'clock. "
"10269590","10271250"," See if the bulls can put something together."
"10271490","10272830"," They're trying their asses off in here."
"10273230","10274110"," I'll give the bulls that. "
"10274310","10274650"," They're trying."
"10275850","10276570"," They're consolidating."
"10278250","10280530"," If they have one more shot at it, it's right now. "
"10281950","10283930"," This is your last chance right here."
"10285390","10286130"," You got it, right?"
"10286470","10287510"," One, two, three."
"10288470","10288490"," Boom. "
"10288730","10290270"," You should get a rocket ship right now to 420."
"10291950","10293310"," Mero wants you up here at 420."
"10293990","10296390"," So that you can grab a short, take it down into FMC. "
"10296910","10302150"," He wants to take a short, close his computer, get into his bunker and wake up tomorrow morning"
"10302150","10302550"," attendees."
"10311250","10313210"," What do I think about real estate in 2022?"
"10320830","10322870"," Look towards commercial was two things."
"10323250","10327990"," There's how do I explain this?"
"10328090","10329610"," You guys want to hear my take on real estate?"
"10330670","10331450"," I'm going to double this down. "
"10331610","10332690"," I think I'm going to try to double this down."
"10334450","10337570"," So there are, I'm going to call them banks."
"10337970","10340430"," So you're like, you want to open an office building. "
"10344720","10348900"," So you take a loan out for $1 million."
"10350260","10357280"," And in that note that you took out, if you have a full capacity, you're paying your note down."
"10358060","10364940"," If you're at 50% capacity, you're not paying your full note and you're allowed to. "
"10364940","10369660"," You're evolving commercial loans for real estate holders."
"10372020","10375200"," Then you get someone's telling you the economy is going to go to shit."
"10376740","10382400"," So you're paying too much on not paying the full mortgage down. "
"10382580","10384160"," So you try to repackage your loan."
"10386790","10391930"," And so you find out that you can't repackage your loan because there's no money back there from the"
"10391930","10394690"," Fed to help repackage that loan."
"10399370","10400990"," So you start pitching. "
"10401210","10405030"," You actually go to the person that sold you that piece of property and prepare for us that sold you"
"10405030","10405430"," that loan."
"10406530","10410090"," You start filing lawsuits seriously."
"10411610","10420210"," And you start, you start firing lawsuits at everybody and they can cause commercial real estate"
"10420210","10421150"," markets that start to crash. "
"10423800","10428840"," So the Fed hears about it and the Fed goes shit, we can't turn the money printer off to parts"
"10428840","10429600"," of the economy."
"10430080","10433320"," Even though we're going to tell the equities market that we are."
"10435420","10444420"," So they got to go in and bail out the real estate community commercial real estate community. "
"10447750","10451390"," They got Amazon out there telling you that they fucked up with too many buildings."
"10451710","10452310"," They're one of them."
"10452450","10454330"," It's all kinds of commercial real estate. "
"10455130","10458010"," So they got to pump that market up is what they have to do."
"10458730","10460650"," And they will attempt to."
"10463800","10465960"," How does that impact a residential real estate?"
"10466420","10468880"," The only problem I could tell you about residential real estate. "
"10468960","10474360"," The one thing I always giggle about is people say, I want you to know that if you're in residential"
"10474360","10477180"," real estate that prices don't just slightly come down."
"10477860","10482640"," They either stay up or they swing down."
"10482640","10486820"," There's never really like a slow move down in real estate prices. "
"10487040","10488140"," It's usually pretty quick."
"10488900","10493300"," What happens is you get too many people with similar properties that they look for the cheapest"
"10493300","10493660"," price."
"10494600","10499800"," And they start, they start talking 5 grand, 10 grand, 20 grand, 30 grand, 40 grand, 50 grand just"
"10499800","10500660"," to get out of where they're at. "
"10500820","10501780"," So they don't, they panic."
"10502060","10503900"," So it's like, it's just like the market panic selling."
"10504160","10504500"," Same thing. "
"10505180","10506120"," Real estate markets very similar."
"10508440","10511600"," No, but I don't think that you're going to have, I don't think the real estate market is going to"
"10511600","10513100"," be bad just yet."
"10515020","10521540"," And I think if the commercial real estate market gets backed up or pumped up from the Fed, which is"
"10521540","10525560"," called, it's not gray money, but it's called that's called like shade money or something. "
"10528040","10529800"," It just happens, right?"
"10530780","10535120"," So anyways, I don't think the real estate market dumps right away."
"10535120","10540850"," I think it stays up for at least another year to three years."
"10541770","10547790"," But the other problem there too that people are coming into is people paid huge taxes. "
"10548070","10552170"," They just paid a huge, I paid huge to my tax bill this year was fucking ridiculous."
"10555590","10559910"," And some people took shit tons of PPP or PPP loans."
"10560290","10560990"," People took free money. "
"10562450","10566210"," Some people out there taking like half million dollars, million dollars."
"10566710","10569830"," And the tax bill came, tax bill ban came this year and they had to pay a big bill."
"10570870","10575310"," But the one thing that you'll realize if you own like a million dollar home in certain places in"
"10575310","10582320"," this country, your taxes get reassessed more frequently. "
"10582320","10586800"," Some places I've lived in own houses, you get reassessed when you pull a permit."
"10587520","10590700"," Some places it's every four years, some places on sale."
"10591820","10593220"," That's the key one right there. "
"10593380","10597780"," If you buy a house, but what a lot of people don't realize is not everybody, but a lot of"
"10597780","10598580"," people, you'd be surprised."
"10599600","10604400"," How many people don't know that when they go into like a neighborhood, especially like a gentrified"
"10604400","10604780"," day road."
"10605840","10607220"," One that's being gentrified. "
"10609040","10614160"," A house might have been the previous owner might have been like, yeah, I own this house for 20"
"10614160","10619260"," years or 10 years or 15 years and I was paying about it for $150,000."
"10619260","10624680"," We're not going to tell you that, but they're going to say, my taxes are 3000 a year or 5000"
"10624680","10625420"," a year."
"10626660","10631100"," They're property taxes or you see what their property taxes are in the data, right?"
"10631920","10632820"," And you go, that's not bad. "
"10632840","10633940"," I can afford that with that mortgage."
"10636280","10642120"," And then what happens is you get you get your new, you get reassessed once that that sale goes"
"10642120","10642420"," through."
"10643820","10649460"," And all of a sudden your property taxes are expected to be at, let's say, four or 5000 a year. "
"10649820","10651800"," And now they're like nine or 10,000 a year."
"10652620","10654860"," And the court, I don't know how you pay your taxes."
"10655160","10657000"," Mostly it's quarterly or half a year. "
"10657160","10657900"," Depends on what you can act."
"10658160","10659440"," Sometimes you can push them up for the whole year."
"10660320","10661180"," Pay them where you live. "
"10661880","10664120"," But you then get your new tax bill on this new house."
"10664120","10669460"," You just bought, you know, like, holy fuckers, I owe five grand in taxes right now."
"10670880","10674720"," And even though they're driving nice cars around, they're not ready for that hit, right?"
"10674720","10681560"," You just paid 20, $30,000, $50,000 on top of what you thought you were paying in income taxes. "
"10682240","10685040"," Paying an extra 30, 60, 100, whatever it is."
"10685780","10688660"," And then you get hit with another bill for five, 10,000, 15,000."
"10688780","10689400"," You know, expecting that. "
"10690200","10691660"," And you're like, shit, that's all my savings."
"10693220","10695760"," What am I doing for the next three months or six months or whatever?"
"10699130","10705630"," I guess, I guess the kids that are going on with Chevy Chase vacation instead of European vacation."
"10707110","10708630"," We're going to the Grand Canyon kids. "
"10723310","10724210"," Y'all take a look at Rick."
"10727890","10729310"," Taxes are fucked up right now."
"10730310","10731890"," I don't know how many of you own houses and shit. "
"10732030","10733590"," I just bought a house the past couple of years."
"10734370","10735470"," Taxes ain't no joke."
"10736930","10737830"," They're in, they suck. "
"10743320","10745160"," You know, that's how they suck."
"10746180","10747280"," I'm like a neo-liberal."
"10749120","10751300"," Like, I don't mind paying my spare share of taxes. "
"10752680","10755440"," I fucking hate paying taxes that don't go to things that help people."
"10756960","10758300"," That shit pisses me off."
"10759160","10760020"," That's the funny thing. "
"10760080","10761620"," Everybody's a liberal until they own a house."
"10762940","10767340"," And they get that voting booth and they're like, they're like, I don't know."
"10769520","10771040"," Are they going to spend my money the right way?"
"10771320","10777120"," I don't mind, I don't mind paying it, but he, he, he, he, look at this, the politician. "
"10777500","10781260"," You're like, man, this person, you know, they can really going to do this or not."
"10786820","10788420"," It's actually one of my big problems with DNC."
"10788880","10789720"," They'll just establish DNC. "
"10794940","10796820"," And of course, I'm a gun toad or two, so."
"10798620","10800500"," He has to combine all that kind of shit into it."
"10801160","10802460"," Because everything is politicized. "
"10802560","10803560"," All the politics, they are politicized."
"10804480","10806180"," And the crazy part is, they're both spenders."
"10806920","10809400"," Like, the Republicans are fucking spenders and the Democrats are spenders. "
"10810160","10811640"," They basically have no political party anymore."
"10814280","10815440"," They're all bad."
"10819580","10820320"," You know, from the waist. "
"10820640","10825200"," I do, we're just talking about, uh, the feds actually losing money right now."
"10825200","10827000"," There was a video I posted this morning."
"10827680","10833680"," Talked about, uh, the feds going to have to do some funny, funny accounting because they're going"
"10833680","10840720"," to lose money on, on loans and backing loans or not, I don't know if it's loans or if it's"
"10840720","10845680"," on, um, uh, bonds that they're going to be losing money on. "
"10845920","10852240"," Tons of money on either bonds or, uh, or, or commercial, uh, back from commercial, um, mortgages"
"10852240","10853200"," that are backed by the Fed."
"10858180","10861200"," There's a video I put out, a couple videos I put out this morning just take a, take a peek"
"10861200","10863240"," at and watch tonight if you haven't already watched them."
"10866620","10868040"," Let's see if the bulls can put it together. "
"10870100","10871300"," It's a good spot for the bulls."
"10871740","10872360"," I like this setup."
"10873380","10875040"," I'm not going to lie, I like this setup for it. "
"10875900","10877000"," My price target still stands."
"10877320","10878480"," There's always some sellers up there."
"10879160","10880120"," They're coming in right now. "
"10881460","10884000"," They're up here at 4.18 now, 4, 4.19, 24."
"10884780","10885860"," They're getting a little more, more aggressive."
"10887340","10887960"," Be careful up here. "
"10894080","10895000"," Bear's coming down."
"10896760","10898040"," They're getting, they're getting salty."
"10898280","10898720"," They're getting sweaty. "
"10904310","10905210"," Same right here."
"10906310","10907070"," They're up there."
"10907130","10907450"," They're hiding. "
"10909690","10911310"," Way more aggressive than before."
"10915320","10916800"," Bears are looking to pounce right here."
"10920060","10921640"," Bears making so much money right now. "
"10921800","10925420"," Their bears are like, they're like combing out their coats."
"10925720","10927420"," They've got like nicely combed out coats."
"10929160","10932220"," You're going to like a bear cave and it's all nice in there. "
"10932700","10934200"," You have like nice new rugs and stuff."
"10934740","10939340"," Picked up all the trash, the bear cans, the whiskey bottles from the past couple of years."
"10941970","10943250"," Dressing their kids in nice clothes. "
"10947580","10951560"," Upgraded to like a Subaru from an old F-150."
"10955180","10957880"," Had a good few months here, good four or five months."
"10963420","10965540"," Got like big grooming habits now. "
"10968240","10975400"," Got like dermatologists pulling out those ingrown bear mangy stuff that be like ingrown hairs and"
"10975400","10975660"," shit."
"10976280","10977340"," Trimming their toenails."
"10994910","10995430"," Bears. "
"10996390","10999130"," I was down at the monocles store the other day."
"11001050","11003430"," And all the bears were in there buying monocles."
"11005190","11006470"," Top hats and shit. "
"11015020","11018120"," Trying on like horse riding boots and stuff."
"11029170","11033250"," The other day I was on fin to it and boy I sneezed and a bull pulled out of handkerchief"
"11033250","11033670"," for me."
"11033670","11034130"," I was shocked. "
"11035050","11035970"," It was clean."
"11037150","11037730"," It was new."
"11038130","11039510"," Is it a monogram on it?"
"11040430","11041890"," His name was a monogram on it. "
"11052030","11052870"," Too funny."
"11055370","11056290"," Using big words."
"11062110","11063990"," You can't do a set of golf clubs. "
"11067100","11068420"," All dapper and shit."
"11071080","11072740"," I'm picking up ladies at the bar."
"11074870","11076090"," All that kind of noise. "
"11078490","11080830"," I can't imagine being a bear wife right now."
"11082510","11084270"," Two years of straight bitching."
"11085510","11087730"," Then you get to tell your wife I fucking told you so. "
"11089310","11090810"," And you didn't listen to me."
"11095760","11096720"," Oh man."
"11102280","11103600"," That's not good right there. "
"11107070","11108210"," You know I'm making drawings."
"11111440","11113560"," Bears looking to fucking keep that down there."
"11114440","11115520"," Push that down below. "
"11123030","11124930"," See if the supports get any weaker in here."
"11125150","11125530"," A little bit weaker."
"11125910","11127130"," Bears starting to step in right now. "
"11130100","11131480"," See where the bulls are."
"11132880","11135240"," I don't like seeing this stuff down here."
"11135380","11135980"," This wasn't here before. "
"11136180","11137360"," This 41460."
"11137600","11138880"," It's accepting lower prices."
"11139520","11140000"," 41540. "
"11142220","11144860"," It's a place where it's kind of do or die for the bulls."
"11144860","11146680"," Bulls don't have too much."
"11147940","11149460"," See down here right. "
"11150380","11152000"," Bulls are weakening down here."
"11152180","11154980"," Bears are starting to gain some power up here."
"11159080","11160260"," So be careful down here. "
"11160560","11162880"," This is kind of do or die for the bulls."
"11162900","11164280"," Bulls want to get that consolidation."
"11166800","11168040"," 1, 2, 3 right. "
"11168260","11168640"," Push higher."
"11169440","11169900"," 1, 2."
"11170180","11172800"," You really only have one more chance here to get that rip higher."
"11175730","11179570"," Bulls are starting to lower where they're willing to buy this dip down here too right. "
"11179570","11180310"," You're seeing that."
"11180490","11183390"," And you're also seeing the bears starting to lay some pressure on right here."
"11190020","11192160"," You guys already know what I think we're doing. "
"11195380","11196720"," I don't think you're escaping."
"11196980","11200940"," I don't think you have escaped velocity today to escape the market."
"11202120","11203440"," Which kind of sucks to say. "
"11206690","11208490"," You can see the bears appear again stronger."
"11208950","11210470"," And you're getting a weaker support down here."
"11216000","11216960"," Same thing though right. "
"11217220","11217660"," It's the same."
"11220300","11221060"," It's the same."
"11221320","11222740"," This is the don't ditto in the middle. "
"11222740","11224040"," If you're a bear weight confirmation."
"11225760","11226760"," Take the safe trade."
"11226920","11227780"," If you're a bear here right. "
"11228180","11232500"," The safe fate is for you to wait for sub below confirmation."
"11232780","11234740"," And then the rip rip lower right."
"11239660","11241300"," If you're really a true true bull. "
"11241540","11242800"," You're looking for capitulation."
"11243860","11244520"," Save it."
"11245020","11245880"," And then the move higher. "
"11246700","11246720"," Right."
"11247460","11250920"," But all of this did in the middle you know it's kind of dangerous unless you're already long down"
"11250920","11251140"," here."
"11274480","11275200"," All right. "
"11275200","11275520"," I'll be back."
"11275700","11277780"," Give me like a twelve fifteen and it's one o'clock."
"11278420","11280040"," This is that middle the afternoon right. "
"11280260","11280760"," Trapping bulls."
"11281040","11281540"," Trapping bears."
"11282600","11284280"," Everybody has an idea where we're going. "
"11286300","11287780"," This is all trapping right."
"11288240","11289860"," You're getting locked in for FOMC."
"11290920","11292700"," Everybody's making calls as to where we're going. "
"11292900","11293260"," My thought."
"11293520","11295800"," My overriding thought is until there's a leak."
"11296960","11298300"," You're not going to escape for twenty. "
"11299160","11303880"," My other overriding thought is that you're not going to escape for twenty."
"11304280","11304720"," You're just not."
"11305680","11306980"," I like this space building here. "
"11307100","11307920"," I like this over here."
"11308480","11309300"," Don't get me wrong."
"11311300","11312960"," But you're waiting for FOMC. "
"11313240","11314060"," Or you're waiting for a leak."
"11314540","11317200"," Or you're waiting for puts to lose value."
"11318020","11319680"," A large put protection orders. "
"11321300","11324280"," To lose value over here leading into FOMC."
"11324600","11325900"," Or at least the press are down here."
"11328880","11329980"," Pick your poison right. "
"11330100","11330920"," If you're a big time bear."
"11331120","11333340"," You can pick your poison up and here's a great place to short down."
"11333760","11335940"," Down and here's a great place to be going long right. "
"11336060","11336860"," Buy some call spreads."
"11336860","11339420"," Buy some call spreads for a much larger move higher."
"11339900","11340580"," If you want to know. "
"11341780","11345460"," If we get a if you get a neutral to a davish fed."
"11346920","11347700"," That's my take."
"11347900","11349240"," I don't think you're going to get it all. "
"11349900","11355040"," I think I think the fed is realizing that they can't actually do two T two what to what they"
"11355040","11355700"," said they've done."
"11356620","11358440"," I think there's going to be supportive credit markets."
"11358460","11361560"," I think that you have to support the credit market right now. "
"11364060","11366140"," I think the price target is eventually 450."
"11367320","11369020"," 440 is a good target though."
"11369660","11370860"," This is the safe bet 440. "
"11374200","11377720"," I think if the fed is slightly hawkish to somewhat hawkish."
"11378040","11379480"," I still don't think we break 4000."
"11380000","11381700"," If we do break 4000, it'll be brief. "
"11383080","11384300"," I think it'll be something quick."
"11385120","11388560"," I think it's somewhere we dip below and that dip is bought."
"11388560","11392760"," I do think though even if I think if the fed is hawkish. "
"11393400","11396300"," You're going to see like if he's hawkish, you're going to see a quick dip below."
"11396780","11397440"," Move higher."
"11397940","11400960"," Some acceptance in here and then we move lower. "
"11403060","11406700"," I think the only way you see a break of 4000."
"11407480","11412500"," And that you see big red bars down right where the market really breaks."
"11412500","11418240"," Is if they launch two T full across the board and they go up 75 DPS. "
"11419960","11421080"," That's not the Fed's mandate."
"11422420","11423520"," Be aware of that."
"11423780","11429360"," Fed's mandate is not to create panic selling down below 400. "
"11429700","11436600"," Now if they super super super hawkish, they can keep it at 4000 and give acceptance and allow an"
"11436600","11438640"," orderly retreat from the market."
"11439060","11440700"," So my take is we go up from here."
"11441440","11442640"," But I don't know that it's today. "
"11443220","11447780"," I think this I think you get resistance resistance and then they cut you loose to run it up."
"11447880","11453240"," You're going to build up a bunch of buyers in here and eventually it's going to explode."
"11454740","11458880"," And so I took this trade down here made bank and I'm looking for that move. "
"11459100","11463080"," These moves in here sometimes you lose patience and think I'm going to buy this right now."
"11463100","11466440"," I'm not waiting, but sometimes pay patience pays off."
"11466600","11467420"," It's down here somewhere. "
"11468060","11470120"," It's down here somewhere and this is where the buy is."
"11470120","11472000"," I think I could be wrong and miss this."
"11472440","11476380"," Now let's say I am wrong and I miss this down here, right?"
"11476940","11478940"," I'm also looking for one other thing if I missed it. "
"11479120","11481560"," So this gives me feeling good about my buy."
"11483400","11483840"," Right?"
"11484120","11484540"," This doesn't."
"11486460","11492500"," So for me to feel good about my buy, it would take a move higher. "
"11493980","11494940"," Consolidation, right?"
"11496600","11498240"," Get the bears coming in here, right?"
"11499540","11500500"," Trying to short it."
"11501900","11508320"," Then you start to break off in the moment that you start to trigger the bears here."
"11508800","11509480"," This is the fuel. "
"11509620","11514760"," You take this long here up to 420, excuse me, 430, 444, 450 above."
"11515920","11517660"," So I'd feel safe buying calls here."
"11520080","11521900"," I'd feel safe buying calls somewhere down in here. "
"11522560","11523840"," That's where I feel safe buying calls."
"11524040","11524860"," I don't feel safe."
"11527200","11530240"," In this traffic right now with FOMC tomorrow. "
"11532760","11534420"," And I want that big ass play."
"11535280","11536280"," This is my time."
"11536500","11541860"," If there's a time in these months when you get full capitulation of the market, I need these to"
"11541860","11543340"," print for me big. "
"11543880","11546000"," I want big prints, guaranteed prints."
"11547180","11548240"," I want safety in my prints."
"11560610","11561070"," I want danger. "
"11562350","11562950"," I want big prints."
"11564070","11566890"," Just note that there's sellers coming in the market heavily right now."
"11569280","11570020"," I'll be right back. "
"11663890","11670110"," Expeech Naval in a press interview saying that an interest rate hike is possible in July."
"11703600","11707620"," It's a matter of this comment from Schnabel in line with some recent reporting that suggests ECB"
"11707620","11710720"," could be ready to raise rates as soon as July."
"11781880","11787230"," We're from ECB Schnabel saying that we have to stop high inflation getting anchored in"
"11787230","11787590"," expectations. "

"12127520","12130480"," Four nineteen fifty four twenty. "
"12131080","12135800"," You want to keep your eyes on the right top right hand side here and see if the bulls are"
"12135800","12140740"," pushed back and above the four twenty five and see these sellers here quite large."
"12143160","12145580"," Next stop above is four twenty five."
"12276360","12277940"," Then I come back on as we get up in here. "
"12285980","12289860"," There's being pushed higher here as we head up into this four nineteen fifty area."
"12292120","12294120"," Now backpedaling to four twenty fifty."

"12315560","12317200"," Now we'll see if we can get higher than that."
"12317280","12318560"," You should be able to get higher than that."
"12318660","12319420"," If you break up here. "

"12384010","12384870"," Right around four twenty one. "
"12386670","12388750"," So we'll see if this thing can get up there at four twenty one."
"12389290","12391570"," It could be a higher rate, a higher push."
"12393310","12394130"," Right up in here. "

"12557540","12561780"," People throw in two hundred five hundred thousand dollar bets on spy right now. "
"12564360","12565860"," Eventually we'll get enough call."

"12567560","12570400"," And also watching some UV X Y puts coming in. "
"12570500","12570800"," That's unusual."
"12571100","12573300"," We don't see that unless they're making a market turn."
"12574660","12577720"," Our boss indicator right now is only eighty percent. "
"12578040","12580520"," But you've got twenty three orders at six point eight million dollars."
"12580660","12581120"," Not big buddy."
"12581300","12583620"," But these are some day traders. "
"12583880","12586260"," These are investors looking for a bottom down here."
"12587100","12588980"," Or this is a bank hiding a trade."
"12590600","12593820"," But they are playing this trade for the fourth right now starting to load the boat. "
"12596610","12598250"," Not much and puts right now."
"12598390","12600870"," Four orders for one point six million in the spy side."
"12603900","12605360"," Nothing too unusual in here. "

"12634160","12637900"," They're going to stop having to hedge the short side of this trade. "
"12638760","12641240"," And that will fuel this rip higher at some point."
"12642380","12646380"," I'm still of the opinion that we're not going to start to bust through the sport twenty right now."
"12646840","12649400"," We're going to bang up here and bounce off of it today. "
"12653700","12659320"," I'll tell you what the addition of calls into the market right now can ramp this up."
"12660460","12667420"," Can ramp up the head, the stopping of the hedging of the short side of this market."
"12668340","12672460"," And the call side can actually help with it with a nice rally. "
"12677580","12678900"," Just grinding higher, grinding higher."
"12679300","12681640"," Markets starting to flip right now to some extent."
"12682640","12684260"," Even if we get weak up here for twenty. "
"12685260","12689120"," I want you to, even if it rejects the four twenty, there is a call side coming into the market"
"12689120","12690840"," right now that's quite large."
"12695820","12696480"," Quite large."
"12704120","12708880"," If you are going, if you're like, hey, Cap, trend, trend against your ACAP, not waiting for another"
"12708880","12709160"," dip. "
"12709780","12711000"," And you are buying calls in here."
"12711060","12712480"," Don't go a hundred percent in here."
"12712740","12713540"," Save some money. "
"12713740","12714060"," Thank you."
"12714140","12718960"," Roger is saying we need higher rates to moderate demand, including demand in the housing market."
"12719320","12719600"," Yeah. "
"12719740","12720900"," We'll learn about that in a minute."
"12720900","12721520"," It's not in the meeting."
"12722580","12723380"," So in here. "
"12724520","12728400"," Let's say you are like, hey, I took long air cap and I'm holding them every letting it go."
"12729700","12733360"," Then what you want to do is don't be going a hundred percent in this trade."
"12733600","12735620"," You always want to be like 10, 20, 30. "
"12736460","12743980"," And then have a time frame for having more, more firewood, more bullets somewhere down in here."
"12744160","12744300"," Okay."
"12744640","12749620"," In case we trade it down, let's say you're long for like the fourth on four twenties or four"
"12749620","12750160"," thirties. "
"12750840","12754220"," Or you're long in the sixth for four thirties, something like that."
"12754360","12758140"," Make sure you have some ammo to add in case the market sells off."
"12758140","12759160"," If you get, that's the sell. "
"12759340","12764240"," But like if the market sells down here at any point down to four fifteen, if it trades down to"
"12764240","12767580"," four ten or even four thousand, give the ability to jump back in."
"12767920","12775860"," And, you know, if you have like a hundred fucking calls at two dollars and fifty cents, you need to"
"12775860","12781800"," be able to add two, three, four hundred dollars or four hundred racks of calls to make those calls"
"12781800","12782700"," profitable, right?"
"12782700","12785780"," Or you might even have to change the price target, right?"
"12785980","12789800"," So if you buy in four twenties or four thirties and if we were to trade out of four hundred,"
"12790900","12792480"," I don't think we're getting down to four."
"12792680","12794780"," My view is never going to bloodbath the putt. "
"12797080","12802240"," You know, it's two hundred point negative fed or, well, I'll tell you the fed down here."
"12802540","12808600"," If you need to reposition yourself, you don't want to get blown out on a hundred percent trade on"
"12808600","12809400"," this trade right now."
"12810680","12811900"," How's the ammo available?"
"12818160","12822340"," Roger's expecting the house of price proof to moderate and streets go up. "
"12822960","12825500"," I think price growth is unsustainable."
"12825740","12826460"," It's drawing in Canada."
"12826740","12827180"," Nice move. "
"12828400","12828960"," Right."
"12829300","12830180"," This was saved here."
"12831460","12832020"," Saved. "
"12832500","12833000"," Came up here."
"12834300","12835760"," Double topped it right here."
"12837140","12837900"," It's not bearish. "
"12841040","12841540"," Kind of."
"12841760","12842440"," Kind of bearish."
"12842620","12843240"," One, two, three. "
"12843240","12849700"," But there's a lot of big coming into the market."
"12857260","12859480"," But sometimes patience pays too, right?"
"12874980","12875560"," Excuse me."
"12875700","12878540"," A little bit of a, a little bit of a rejection above here. "
"12878540","12879120"," I'll take a look at that."
"12882650","12886950"," Like we talked about how the price doesn't match the charts, right?"
"12887170","12889830"," But these charts here are different, right?"
"12890750","12892270"," When you see a Norigo candlestick chart."
"12893210","12896930"," So we got up here at this resistance came up here, tested it, came back down, right?"
"12896930","12898750"," This is up here at 4.19.30 or so. "
"12900230","12902870"," 4.20. Lots of bears up in here."
"12903050","12903570"," You can see them."
"12903710","12904710"," They're leaning in right now. "
"12905430","12911130"," They don't want to let you squeeze higher than 4.20. Nice place."
"12911330","12911850"," Take some profit."
"12920410","12921410"," Bullsy to push through. "
"12921670","12922410"," Keep buying calls."
"13048320","13049260"," Here goes a winky."
"13049260","13050760"," Here goes a winky and I just waiting. "
"13051380","13051620"," Yeah."
"13052140","13052460"," I think winky."
"13052640","13053360"," I think we're the only ones. "
"13058160","13060220"," I think winky and I are the only ones that are waiting."
"13061420","13065480"," I think everybody else is loading fucking full tilt, full tilt calls."
"13069990","13071810"," Everybody else is just like, fuck this. "
"13071990","13072490"," I'm long."
"13073190","13073650"," I ain't waiting."
"13075510","13077790"," I think the whole market's like this right now. "
"13078210","13084720"," I think the entire market right now is long."
"13086180","13087640"," I should have just kept my mouth shut."
"13088780","13097540"," I thought you are in monthly calls right now. "
"13102390","13103930"," You guys don't have to wait with me."
"13105850","13107030"," Yeah, it's a nice time on those."
"13107210","13107810"," Me and June are nice. "
"13108910","13110010"," You don't have to wait with me."
"13114360","13115400"," You might miss the run."
"13115780","13117020"," You don't want to miss the run up. "
"13120680","13122080"," You're only in 35%."
"13122080","13123660"," That's nice, too, that you're not full boat."
"13127260","13129100"," Leave a little bit of ammunition ready to rock. "
"13159040","13159920"," One, two."
"13160660","13162140"," Yeah, it's going to blast off, isn't it?"
"13177040","13179280"," Bears about to get fucked up on Tesla."
"13179280","13180420"," I agree with that statement. "
"13181120","13183120"," Bears are about to get wrecked on Tesla."
"13186230","13188430"," Tesla price target 993."
"13190350","13191550"," 1,000. "
"13193810","13194610"," So be it."
"13196570","13198490"," Tesla price target 1,000."
"13202800","13204340"," Pretty, pretty snazzy right there. "
"13230280","13233900"," What are 1,000, what are 1,000 sees on Tesla costs for Friday?"
"13233900","13237460"," Are they overpriced again?"
"13238120","13238600"," Let's have a look."
"13247370","13248510"," No, that's too bad."
"13249170","13249970"," I'll do their keep. "
"13251250","13252390"," Just heads up."
"13252650","13262560"," Tesla calls 1,000, expiring Friday only $3.10. Man, those"
"13262560","13263660"," can print fucking heavy."
"13268250","13269130"," Real heavy. "
"13270510","13271810"," 1,000% probably."
"13275690","13277370"," That's some juicy shit right there."
"13279190","13281370"," May 6th, 1,000 see. "
"13283310","13283910"," Pricey."
"13289840","13291280"," It's a good price right there."
"13291380","13291960"," They're dirt cheap. "
"13293620","13295420"," Dirt cheap what they can pay."
"13296400","13297160"," I like that trade."
"13298640","13300700"," Tesla Friday, 1,000 see. "
"13303140","13305000"," I like that trade a lot."
"13314000","13315500"," That's a juicy fucking trade."
"13321400","13323340"," I'm trying to bum a crash higher right now. "
"13323900","13325240"," Watching the VIX still."
"13328200","13329840"," Be paying attention to the VIX here."
"13334140","13335940"," Remember we talked about the VIX the other day?"
"13347760","13349240"," They're in a larger time frame. "
"13349420","13350600"," You guys tune in every day."
"13352380","13354060"," I'm going to pick that blue line right here."
"13355580","13356660"," Remember this one right here?"
"13366360","13367740"," It's in a larger scene here, right?"
"13367980","13370440"," Remember when we were talking about this the other day and I said to you. "
"13372260","13373740"," We were up here I said to you."
"13373840","13381710"," I said this is the place where VIX bulls get long and they think it's going up here."
"13381930","13383950"," I was like I might get up there for a quick second. "
"13384790","13386210"," Maybe like to see here."
"13387510","13391130"," I was like this is where VIX bulls get trapped when you should be buying it down here."
"13391290","13392450"," Remember that whole conversation I had. "
"13394010","13395250"," It doesn't mean it'll go back up here."
"13395590","13401390"," Remember we looked at this tag here back in January where we had to go tomorrow?"
"13404110","13406110"," Remember what I said even if we do go up there?"
"13406770","13407390"," I said to you."
"13408210","13412250"," When you come up here and you get trapped as a VIX bull, it's built to be shorted. "
"13413410","13415430"," That you wind up getting trapped in here."
"13415870","13419350"," Even if we are going up here then you're now trapped inside this trade."
"13422520","13424020"," You can see it now coming back down. "
"13424220","13425340"," It's finding some support down here."
"13426040","13426620"," 30-36."
"13428120","13429360"," Also look them down here. "
"13430380","13431700"," We'll do this in a smaller time frame."
"13434370","13437130"," But how when you buy the VIX it's down here, down here."
"13437690","13438470"," You sell the VIX. "
"13438750","13439530"," It's not up here."
"13440790","13441910"," It's up here somewhere."
"13442670","13445930"," Even this swing would be in here somewhere, not up here. "
"13446570","13447110"," This brief moment."
"13447890","13450850"," Sometimes we'll hang out really high and you'll miss out on some money."
"13454210","13455510"," The trade's late, right?"
"13456190","13456590"," To an extent. "
"13458630","13460870"," Even if we get a bearish bed."
"13463030","13464050"," The trade's kind of late."
"13465210","13468590"," So in here, what are you looking for for some support into tomorrow for bears?"
"13469130","13470390"," It's the same place, right?"
"13470650","13471010"," 30-42. "
"13471610","13475870"," You'd really like to see it get down here to 20-97."
"13477130","13477790"," That would give you a 420."
"13482980","13487320"," If you see this settled down here, you're going to want your price target for your 430 that was"
"13487320","13487780"," down here. "
"13488640","13493080"," The break of this rise in the VIX is down here like 20 bucks or something."
"13499440","13500540"," Let's see it down here."
"13506160","13508420"," It is basing in here just so you can see it. "
"13514260","13516740"," So do the VIX bulls get one more stab at it or not?"
"13517060","13517760"," Are they just trapped?"
"13519100","13522440"," A lot of VIX puts coming in right now across the board."
"13523520","13525480"," A lot of calls coming in equities right now."
"13535500","13541480"," A lot of UVXY puts coming in looking for that drop on the VIX. "
"13556770","13558190"," The VIX bulls want to slam it home."
"13558930","13562810"," Want the VIX to fall off the edge of the earth and blast off up in here."
"13567320","13568580"," A lot of work done in here. "
"13568680","13573760"," If you're a bull that's not in the market and you didn't want to sit through this grind, this is"
"13573760","13575640"," building to a squeeze play higher."
"13576960","13579000"," The price target, 421-22."
"13586980","13590160"," If you've eaten all day long for a trade, this is a nice trade for a bull. "
"13590660","13592340"," Just a quick squeeze up higher."
"13593520","13595180"," Jump in, jump out, take the money and run."
"13595180","13597140"," It's a nice, nice trade right here setting up. "
"13602160","13604360"," Nice build up right here for a squeeze higher."
"13606530","13607790"," There's 420 right there."
"13611780","13613000"," See if the bulls can do it. "
"13613520","13618540"," We're inside one hour now to the close of pitch rating in U.S. energy markets, WTR crude futures."
"13619440","13623800"," Not far from the days low, down about 2% at 102.95. That's really good."
"13627600","13628500"," You're going to roll it over. "
"13632300","13633880"," You only got so much time bulls."
"13634560","13636100"," You have pitch trading ending on energy."
"13637840","13639400"," Lows of the day on energy, not good. "
"13660070","13660850"," Come on bulls."
"13669910","13671290"," The bear's a little bit weaker above."
"13671590","13672950"," Grinding those bears out right now. "
"13673510","13674610"," Burning those bears out."
"13674730","13675850"," They're slightly higher now at 423."
"13676430","13677110"," This is good to see. "
"13679730","13681330"," You can see it right here even better, right?"
"13681950","13683390"," Bears moving up now to 420."
"13684230","13685810"," They're weak to 420 here."
"13713160","13714180"," Let me push it up. "
"13715580","13716520"," Push it up, baby."
"13716780","13717520"," Get us up there to 420."
"13748750","13751590"," Calls are expensive as fuck right now on the indexes. "
"13752070","13753870"," Like the spy calls are expensive."
"13759370","13759890"," Expensive."
"13764270","13765230"," Stupid expensive. "
"13801860","13804640"," Who the fuck are you guys going to sell these calls to?"
"13807410","13808410"," Expensive as fuck."
"13810490","13812450"," There's no bid on 430 right now."
"13813710","13816010"," There's no bid on 430 is expiring in the fourth. "
"13816590","13817810"," Fucking bids all up on 420."
"13818510","13824790"," Fucking 420 calls cost $3.14. 4.19 is a 360."
"13827850","13834410"," 4.25 is our $1.36. Expensive. "
"13840450","13842170"," With a day left on them too."
"13843130","13846170"," Most fucking things better be worth $89 by tomorrow and a day."
"13856920","13858560"," The cab spy goes to 450. "
"13858560","13861180"," What does that do to queues and RK?"
"13861440","13862060"," Whole lot of nothing."
"13862300","13863400"," We're going to sell it right down again."
"13868050","13872410"," We're going to give bulls hopes and prayers so they don't like it to flee the market. "
"13881990","13884270"," I'm still not bullish there at 450."
"13884550","13886130"," I think 450 is in the top end too."
"13887110","13897470"," If you're looking at the channel that we're in, 450"
"13897470","13898070"," seems reasonable. "
"13898070","13898910"," We'll break out of that."
"13898910","13901230"," We fucking did it not too long ago."
"13902470","13904150"," This seems more reasonable up here. "
"13905270","13906410"," Just up here this 440."
"13907610","13908910"," That's the responsible trade."
"13910510","13911790"," But you know, FMC is over. "
"13912090","13915850"," There's no real, like, all you need to do is have a truce in Ukraine or something."
"13916130","13916530"," Then there you go."
"13916630","13916910"," There's 450. "
"13918610","13921470"," The 450 is an upper price target."
"13922150","13924430"," It's not something that I'm like, have 100% on 450."
"13927250","13930950"," You've got to understand, we're down here because of what's going on. "
"13931630","13932550"," 450 is reasonable."
"13933290","13936790"," But like 450 would be like, hey, I bought puts there."
"13936930","13939970"," And then all of a sudden you get squeezed just a little bit higher that melt up. "
"13940110","13940750"," That lasts a little bit."
"13940890","13941710"," The retail doesn't trade."
"13944570","13946030"," We haven't had one of these in a while too. "
"13946690","13949310"," I don't think it's out of the question to go to 450."
"13950770","13953970"," If we do go to 450, come right back down."
"13956390","13958050"," Or just slow bleed down, one or the other. "
"13963390","13968270"," And if you buy 450 calls and we go to 450 calls with enough time on them."
"13969450","13970510"," And we get to 440."
"13971230","13972110"," They're going to print huge anyways. "
"13974370","13975890"," They're going to print just getting to 440."
"13976310","13976950"," People are going to want them."
"13977990","13980190"," So you hand those up to somebody else and say, here you go. "
"13981390","13983290"," There's plenty left to fill that bag."
"13984370","13986610"," And all of social media will be telling you the same thing."
"13986610","13988470"," They'll say we're going to 450 guaranteed. "
"13992800","13993780"," Still up here at 420."
"13994320","13995020"," I have big questions."
"13995280","13996780"," I guess I want to know for you guys out there. "
"13998520","13999460"," Stop tipping me."
"14000720","14001220"," All right."
"14001380","14001860"," Here's the deal. "
"14002220","14005200"," If you guys are listening in right now, do not tip me."
"14006180","14007320"," Stop tipping me."
"14010400","14014500"," Seriously because I tell you why PayPal is blocking my account. "
"14014640","14015500"," I'm going to talk to you about it right now."
"14015820","14016620"," Real quick and fast."
"14019300","14025900"," Basically, all of these payment service companies are owned by just a few companies. "
"14026920","14030060"," So let's say PayPal owns three or four payment companies."
"14030060","14033740"," They like to use specific payment companies for specific things that you're doing."
"14035120","14039300"," They also sign agreements with different platforms, not just PayPal, everybody. "
"14040300","14044280"," So if I use Streamlabs, they want me to use their payment processors."
"14044280","14049540"," And they're like, oh, we'll offer you super top follows and super this and super that."
"14050020","14054760"," If I stream through YouTube, they offer me the same program with their own payment server,"
"14055220","14055660"," processor. "
"14058420","14059840"," Twitter has a tip cup."
"14060160","14066320"," Now, when you're using their payment processors, oftentimes they're locking you into a deal you"
"14066320","14066920"," have to agree to."
"14067080","14070160"," When you agree to that deal, they're skimming more money off the top than usual. "
"14070920","14073540"," They also hold those payments for long periods of time."
"14074940","14081620"," And they don't like you accepting different kinds of payments with specific payments."
"14082220","14084020"," PayPal doesn't want me accepting tips. "
"14085160","14088740"," Don't need to use a different payment processing arm of their company."
"14089120","14090500"," Subsitting their area of the company."
"14091680","14100880"," So first, the first issue is I'm trying to bypass going through these different social media"
"14100880","14101240"," platforms. "
"14101820","14108660"," And even in the back end, the software platforms by just offering a way to tip."
"14109420","14115580"," So yesterday I got a message that said from PayPal that said, what are you doing accepting these"
"14115580","14116660"," different prices?"
"14116660","14123160"," Like someone's tipping five bucks or three bucks or $1 or $20 different amounts of money."
"14123160","14124400"," Are you sending them something?"
"14125140","14126400"," And I explained what I did. "
"14126800","14129960"," I actually talked to somebody and they're like, you can't do that."
"14132480","14133560"," But we're going to review it."
"14133660","14134460"," They said they review it. "
"14134580","14137500"," Meanwhile, I got on the rabbit hole yesterday to find out what they're going to do to me."
"14137800","14138980"," Now they blocked my account."
"14139280","14142020"," They said, you can accept money, but you can't take any money out. "
"14143840","14148020"," While we review this, meanwhile, they're going to allow more tips to come in."
"14149600","14153760"," And they're eventually going to tell me, no, you can't do this."
"14153800","14156160"," You have to go through PayPal through this other version or whatever. "
"14156640","14160860"," Now, what happens is any of those tips in there, I can refund some of them."
"14161040","14165580"," So I'm going to refund them because what happens is they end up shutting my account down through"
"14165580","14167420"," PayPal for freezing it."
"14167600","14168940"," And they actually keep the money. "
"14169100","14169860"," You don't get the refund."
"14170040","14170680"," I don't get the money."
"14170680","14172320"," It's very fucked up and evil. "
"14172900","14177060"," Now, this isn't because it did anything like nefarious or chargebacks or anything."
"14177300","14178600"," It's because of the structure."
"14179320","14180800"," They want me to sell a subscription. "
"14181360","14184800"," Like, I'm selling you access to a live stream."
"14185720","14185780"," Right?"
"14185900","14186660"," It's something tangible."
"14187440","14189200"," I'm selling you a video every night. "
"14189440","14190400"," I'm selling you a class."
"14190820","14191720"," I'm selling you a newsletter."
"14192740","14192820"," Right?"
"14193060","14196920"," You're paying a receipt every month that says to me, I'm paying you five bucks. "
"14196920","14201700"," And in turn, I send you a receipt that says you paid for a month of my streaming."
"14202040","14203560"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"14204520","14207680"," And so when you're just tipping me, they don't like that."
"14207960","14211400"," They don't like because I'm not proving a service that I gave to you. "
"14211520","14212360"," They don't like that."
"14212580","14216620"," Hey, if you made a great trade or you made money that you're going to take care of me or"
"14216620","14216980"," something."
"14217780","14222760"," If you find value in this in this live stream, they don't want you to just pay what you want. "
"14222760","14228620"," So you're forced into your forced into a subscription based model of some kind."
"14230930","14234530"," So my plan at this point, so they're reviewing it right now."
"14234550","14238230"," But my plan right now is anybody that's tipped me, I'm just going to refund you. "
"14238430","14242330"," I'll have a list of names in the coming day or two of who I refunded."
"14243590","14245790"," So I'll post that in at Captain's Alpha."
"14245790","14250250"," It'll just say your name's not going to be out there telling, you know, telling who's doing what so"
"14250250","14251030"," you can measure dicks. "
"14251650","14252790"," Just so you expect to refund."
"14253710","14255130"," So stop tipping me."
"14255470","14256890"," I appreciate you tipping me. "
"14257610","14259250"," Now, where does that leave us?"
"14261210","14264690"," I could possibly get a way for you to tip."
"14266910","14268710"," But the problem is it has to be easy."
"14269090","14270730"," Whenever you're tipping somebody, you want it to be easy. "
"14270950","14274730"," Like, click the button, you put your credit card in your tip and you say, thank you, I appreciate"
"14274730","14275070"," it."
"14275590","14280410"," If I start making shit complicated, like, visit me on my website, visit me on my Patreon, pick"
"14280410","14281290"," this, pick that."
"14281290","14283230"," It's just too tight consuming. "
"14283570","14284870"," No one wants to fuck around with that shit."
"14285430","14287270"," And these payment processors know that."
"14287790","14293210"," These payment processors know that you want to watch the live stream and you want to hit the tip"
"14293210","14297630"," button and they can actually bend my arm behind my back and say, guess what, buddy?"
"14298330","14303450"," You're keeping 60% and we're keeping 30% and then you're paying 30% in the original taxes. "
"14304490","14306430"," So I end up like 10 bucks literally."
"14306430","14312050"," Then the process is, it's literally like, you're left with like $10, you're left with $3 if you're"
"14312050","14312710"," lucky at the end."
"14313530","14316130"," And they know, they know this, they know they've got you over a barrel. "
"14316530","14317950"," So where am I left at?"
"14319910","14320710"," I'm left at."
"14321650","14326050"," This is the problem too, is that if you guys are tipping me, this is tip based, right?"
"14326610","14328310"," And you guys are tipping me to help support the channel."
"14328910","14329890"," You guys are doing a great job. "
"14330010","14330950"," You're trying to support the channel."
"14331250","14332070"," It's not cheap."
"14332070","14338230"," It costs me somewhere without time, costs me somewhere around 13 to 15,000 a year. "
"14339210","14339970"," Maybe more."
"14340330","14345930"," I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not including the cost of, I'm not including the cost of the"
"14345930","14346200"," equipment."
"14347910","14354010"," Software upgrades, that stuff, I'm not accounting for anything breaks, the lights and the"
"14354010","14355030"," background, all that stuff. "
"14355230","14356370"," I'm not accounting for the internet."
"14356770","14358810"," I have to pay for high speed internet."
"14359030","14360490"," Those are the nonsense I got to pay for. "
"14361030","14363290"," And that doesn't account for my time either, right?"
"14363810","14367250"," Like an honor, an honorarium, like five bucks a day or something."
"14367790","14371670"," I pay that, believe it or not, if there's anything left over, I pay my kids that help me."
"14372030","14376030"," So I'll throw my kids a hundred bucks for a week, if there is. "
"14376370","14377990"," And this is where it gets kind of weird."
"14379790","14382770"," So recently the tips haven't been that much money."
"14383090","14384190"," It hasn't been a lot, right?"
"14384350","14385410"," It's been decent, but not a lot. "
"14385950","14387510"," Yesterday you guys tipped me fucking huge."
"14388210","14389070"," You didn't have to do that."
"14389070","14394010"," And I don't care if it comes in like one week, it's great, three weeks slow, or four weeks it's"
"14394010","14396790"," slow, or even if it's two months and it's not enough to pay for the stream. "
"14397450","14398570"," That's not really my issue."
"14398810","14405050"," My issue though is with them, if they're taking 50, 60% of it between that and taxes, it's really"
"14405050","14406610"," not paying for anything at this point."
"14407230","14410230"," And they're also forcing me into using their stream. "
"14410650","14413750"," So it's like a troll and a bridge, right?"
"14414310","14415430"," So what do I do there?"
"14415670","14417110"," So I don't have many options."
"14417670","14421570"," I'm right now today and tomorrow trying to figure out a way to make an easy way for you to"
"14421570","14421770"," tip."
"14421930","14423130"," That's an alternative to PayPal. "
"14423530","14424530"," I'm working on that right now."
"14424770","14428030"," But I don't want it to happen again where I come back and the money is gone."
"14428710","14431650"," And they're going to tell me to go fuck myself for 18 months. "
"14431850","14434870"," That minimum, literally, it's not sitting you like six to 18 months."
"14435770","14436670"," I'm not kidding."
"14438430","14439850"," Six to 18 months. "
"14440150","14444030"," And with the threat of it's just being declared where we close your account."
"14444030","14449250"," If I continue to accept money there, let's say I consider accepting money there on the hope that"
"14449250","14452170"," they're going to release it in six to 18 months, they might just take it all."
"14452770","14453850"," And so that's a lot of money. "
"14454550","14455770"," You know, it's thousands."
"14456330","14458370"," So I'm in kind of a pickle."
"14458810","14459630"," So don't tip me. "
"14459690","14460590"," Just stop tip me."
"14461090","14463090"," And I'm going to remove it off the video today."
"14463170","14465690"," That's my fault and I'll keep removing it wherever I can find it. "
"14465830","14466990"," I know there's one in Discord too."
"14467270","14468030"," Don't tip me."
"14468330","14473710"," I might have to switch to a donation, a monthly donation. "
"14474130","14477030"," If I do that, I'm not guaranteed I'm going to do that."
"14477190","14481170"," But if I do that, I don't know how to do it."
"14481790","14484090"," I was talking to some friends yesterday about how to do it. "
"14484270","14487370"," And I don't want to do it because I'll be honest."
"14487570","14488860"," On one side of it, I don't want to be beholden."
"14489390","14494050"," But if I am beholden, I don't know what it is where you, I don't know if you guys prefer"
"14494050","14496490"," like set up where it's just a donation by the month. "
"14497130","14499890"," You know, it's like 10, 20 bucks a month or 30 bucks a month."
"14499950","14500950"," Maybe it's tear based."
"14500950","14504570"," Maybe it's I make videos every night that are free. "
"14504810","14508930"," And the live streams are donate or donation monthly donation for you to get access."
"14509590","14514530"," Maybe I leave the discord open, but I believe the options flow behind that donation."
"14514870","14516630"," Maybe I just stopped doing this. "
"14516950","14522590"," Like because that because of how bad it is from these people in these payment processors."
"14522930","14525450"," Maybe it's just we just stopped the street all together."
"14526610","14530930"," So I don't know what the answer is. "
"14530930","14531450"," I like people."
"14531670","14533890"," I know people have a tough go of it out there."
"14534010","14534450"," I get it. "
"14534670","14535590"," Like I fucking get it."
"14536670","14538170"," I there have been time there."
"14538310","14539890"," There are times out there where you don't want to be paying. "
"14540150","14545730"," Do they have paid people three, six, five, $1,000 a month to be in rooms with them to get"
"14545730","14548670"," quote unquote alpha and all that kind of stuff like $1,000 a month."
"14549390","14550470"," And they were horrible."
"14551710","14554550"," They were good, but they might show up like four times a month. "
"14555770","14558930"," You know, so I don't want it to be that and I'm not trying to make a business."
"14558930","14561210"," Like this is not what I don't want to make this a business."
"14562190","14564730"," But I'm being forced into it by these payment processors. "
"14565650","14568730"," And once you've been once you're forced into turning into some kind of a business."
"14569370","14569990"," You're beholden."
"14570070","14572170"," Like I have to be here every day at eight thirty in the morning. "
"14573010","14575070"," Then I have to be here till four at the afternoon, right?"
"14575230","14576130"," I'm going to put a video at nighttime."
"14576410","14578150"," I'm telling you to put that kind of content out."
"14578710","14579830"," I'd start hiring people. "
"14580070","14584270"," If I start hiring people, I have to start charging like real money for this."
"14584990","14588470"," So it's like a it's like a it's like a it's not quite a Pandora's box."
"14588470","14591190"," And then I have to start advertising. "
"14591350","14592950"," Then I have to start getting churn, right?"
"14593170","14594310"," I start getting more followers."
"14595610","14599550"," It's not not real advertising, but I got like I got like broad broadcast out there."
"14599630","14600150"," That's what I'm doing. "
"14600210","14601150"," I got to clean up my act."
"14601330","14605530"," There's always things that that are to come with that that are kind of shitty."
"14605870","14607070"," Like things I don't want to be a part of. "
"14608010","14609550"," So I don't know what to do at this point."
"14609610","14610490"," I'm going to try to keep it."
"14610630","14615470"," My my number one goal out there is to find a way to just leave a donation base. "
"14615990","14619270"," If you want to support channels, a core group to want to support the channel."
"14619390","14619790"," I know that."
"14620170","14622110"," I know that people are making money that hit me. "
"14622630","14624930"," So I'm going to stick to that plan if I can."
"14626130","14626890"," That's my goal."
"14627210","14629790"," If I can't, I can't find a solution. "
"14631370","14632770"," I'm going to give you two other chances."
"14633610","14640410"," And that's we just shut this shit down or we go to some kind of a donation that's monthly for"
"14640410","14640850"," access."
"14641910","14645390"," Some kind of this is somewhat of a pay well. "
"14645890","14648030"," You'd get like access to discord."
"14648130","14653050"," You'd get a video every night, but you wouldn't get access to like a live stream during the day."
"14653750","14655270"," But you're like forced to pay every month. "
"14655650","14656430"," Ten bucks, twenty bucks."
"14657470","14661450"," I don't like that setup because then you want me there too."
"14661650","14666330"," I was talking to a friend yesterday and I was like, you know, like Bob might be trading on Monday,"
"14666330","14667750"," but not trading on Fridays. "
"14668590","14668990"," Right."
"14669530","14675530"," And Mike might be trading on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays and Jill might be trading on Thursdays and"
"14675530","14675730"," Fridays."
"14676230","14680830"," Now, if I was Jill or Michael Bob, I'd want whoever I'm paying to be there on that schedule that"
"14680830","14681410"," they're going to be there. "
"14682030","14684310"," You know, if I'm like, Hey, I'm going to contract now with you."
"14685050","14687890"," I have certain expectations that you're going to be there."
"14687990","14692090"," You're not taking a vacation month more than two months or two weeks a month a year. "
"14692590","14694230"," You're going to be there most five days a week."
"14694370","14695630"," I have like wife and kids and stuff."
"14695630","14699850"," It's hard for me to be here more than when I am right now. "
"14700250","14700730"," So it's difficult."
"14701610","14702610"," So what do I do?"
"14702870","14704870"," I got to hire people and I don't want to hire people."
"14704870","14706010"," I don't want to create a fucking business. "
"14706410","14706690"," I don't."
"14707110","14708030"," I'm not in the fucking mood."
"14709150","14712430"," I'm not in the mood to start a business. "
"14712790","14715270"," And this really isn't something that I would believe in."
"14715450","14721450"," I don't like taking money from people and then growing it and then having to like, you know, you"
"14721450","14726310"," sell a subscription for 20 bucks or 30 bucks and then you're selling a class and then you're"
"14726310","14734610"," selling, you know, indicators and you're selling private time with people and then, you know, you"
"14734610","14738450"," have to understand too, like what a lot of these guys do, right?"
"14739970","14743190"," Is there a lot of these guys will tell you like we can go here and we can go there,"
"14743190","14744230"," but they're not going to tell you."
"14744570","14748650"," My thought is that we're going here because they don't want to be wrong ever. "
"14749390","14755130"," You'll always notice when paid subscriptions that everyone's slick in what they say."
"14755430","14756610"," They're very slick."
"14757090","14761130"," They have a format for how they present what is going to happen. "
"14761430","14764930"," And the reason being is it's not that it's not okay to be wrong."
"14765550","14766870"," It's that they can't be wrong."
"14767050","14768830"," It's that they have to sell. "
"14769190","14772810"," So when they're having to sell, they have to have it out."
"14773150","14775090"," They can say, well, we told you that we could go down to 410."
"14775990","14780770"," You know, in our video yesterday, in our note yesterday, or whatever we have. "
"14781650","14785290"," Of course, you get pissed off, but they have it out."
"14785470","14791930"," They have a way to protect themselves and say, look, we're always right-ish in their calls."
"14792170","14792970"," And they have a good fair point. "
"14793110","14796670"," That's where the guy don't be good job."
"14796970","14797330"," You can subscribe."
"14797730","14798070"," Don't be tipping. "
"14798690","14804390"," So, but there's a difference between there's a different relationship is my point between a paid"
"14804390","14808270"," service and a donation type service."
"14809110","14811950"," A donation type service is, hey, I appreciate you."
"14812330","14813810"," Now, there are some other arguments. "
"14814150","14817430"," I've had someone yesterday tell me it cheapens what you do."
"14819590","14820910"," And people like value."
"14821170","14823190"," They like to buy something so they feel like it's valuable. "
"14823730","14824670"," I understand that too."
"14824930","14825270"," I get it."
"14825450","14825910"," I get that. "
"14826970","14831170"," That you want to have value in what you're, what you're subscribing to."
"14831170","14832650"," So, I get that argument too."
"14832890","14835790"," So, I'm all open ears for all, whatever we do from here. "
"14836470","14837690"," I'm open ears to all of it."
"14838110","14842790"," I don't know if it's like a subscription where I just promise certain things, but it's not too"
"14842790","14842990"," much."
"14843010","14847250"," Maybe there was another idea yesterday that I was talking to someone about where they said, you"
"14847250","14852470"," know, if you can't stream seven or five days a week from open to close, maybe it's just I promise"
"14852470","14858550"," to stream in that subscription, but I'm promising to stream four days a week for you. "
"14858650","14861270"," I'm going to take two weeks off the summer and two weeks off from the winter."
"14861770","14862130"," Holidays."
"14862570","14866350"," I'll be here five days a week or I'm here for major pivots in the market. "
"14866450","14867990"," Like today I have to be here, right?"
"14868390","14869630"," You guys know I have to be here."
"14869970","14871590"," You guys know I have to be here yesterday."
"14872130","14877330"," You guys know that last week we had some days where I fucked up my arm and I wanted to"
"14877330","14879490"," go to a doctor and I couldn't and I was I was here. "
"14879590","14880350"," Like I was here."
"14880450","14885970"," I made sure I was here live streaming even when my arm was fucked up because it was an important"
"14885970","14886990"," part of the market, right?"
"14887150","14888550"," We're in a pivot moment in the market."
"14889150","14891050"," So I don't know exactly what the structure is of this. "
"14891690","14892890"," I don't know what it becomes."
"14893550","14894990"," I don't know if it just gets shut down now."
"14897390","14901850"," But if you think if you're listening right now and you think you have an idea, if you think you"
"14901850","14905090"," have a solution, I know Winky at one time was a streamer. "
"14905610","14909550"," I know some of you out there maybe have some experience in this kind of stuff."
"14910110","14915570"," If you could reach out to me in DMs, I have had one or two people that have experience in"
"14915570","14919250"," this reach out to me in DMs and they were very productive conversations."
"14920690","14922130"," I'm not this person. "
"14922390","14925510"," So I don't know what to do here."
"14927990","14934970"," And I'm usually against what this turns into down the road."
"14935570","14937730"," Usually it turns into greed. "
"14938410","14941770"," And the other thing is that I trade this market."
"14942170","14943270"," I think that's an edge."
"14944290","14951810"," I think if I change my focus to appeasing you that I lose my edge as a trader and investor"
"14951810","14955290"," and I go, well, fuck, I'm going to be trying to make money off people then. "
"14956710","14959070"," So you actually lose a touch on the market."
"14959390","14963030"," You ever notice when you go on vacation like a week or two and you get back to the market"
"14963030","14965310"," and you feel like you lost the touch for a week?"
"14965490","14967470"," It's like something you don't know the market."
"14967630","14972070"," It's that you need to get back into the feel of the market to feel confident with the market. "
"14972070","14977630"," There's something in there with that that I think you lose when you're more focused on growing the"
"14977630","14978790"," business and that kind of stuff."
"14979510","14980250"," So I don't know."
"14980350","14983670"," You guys tell me what you think about that. "
"14984490","14988350"," You know, my money that's in the line trading in here is important to me."
"14988430","14989370"," Like this is my money."
"14990050","14997470"," If I'm out there selling subscriptions to like fucking 5,000 people or like fucking 10,000 a month"
"14997470","15000850"," or 5,000 a month or whatever, that stupid number is something out there crazy. "
"15001350","15002590"," What if I lose the trade?"
"15002830","15003690"," I'm not going to care, right?"
"15003870","15006790"," Because I'm pocketing money from you guys and then I'm just going to blow that."
"15007390","15011930"," So there's like all these dynamics in the background that can get kind of fucking sloppy."
"15013470","15016210"," So, you know, I don't know what to say to you guys. "
"15016410","15017910"," You guys tell me DM me."
"15018430","15022530"," Shoot me a DM on Jim James or Jim James, my public account."
"15023410","15027230"," Shoot me like your phone number or something or an email. "
"15027230","15030450"," My email is CaptainJimJames.com."
"15030610","15033530"," Just CaptainJimJames at email.com."
"15033770","15035370"," It's the best way to contact, believe it or not."
"15037150","15039250"," CaptainJimJames.com is the best way to contact me."
"15039990","15044490"," If you have any ideas or thoughts or anything like that. "
"15045130","15046590"," And I don't mind shutting it down either."
"15046870","15052470"," Like if you guys don't, if you guys are like fucking shutting it down, then I'd love to just sit"
"15052470","15055250"," on Twitter all day long and shit post."
"15059250","15060890"," You know, but I like being here with you guys. "
"15060990","15061810"," I like trading with you guys."
"15062170","15064610"," I like, you know, this is fun."
"15064890","15067190"," I'm still having fun here is the point. "
"15069070","15070690"," You know, I like having fun with you guys."
"15070790","15071770"," Like being here with you."
"15071930","15073890"," I like the conversations in the chat. "
"15074490","15080190"," I like that we fight against the big traders out of the big fucking, the big banks and shit."
"15080690","15081610"," Like I enjoy this."
"15082210","15083030"," I really do. "
"15083550","15090510"," And I don't want it to mutate into something that's either not enjoyable or is like, what the fuck"
"15090510","15091570"," did that guy turn into?"
"15092010","15095110"," Like I don't want you to be like one day like, oh yeah, what the fuck happened to that guy?"
"15095610","15096970"," This guy is a fucking scumbag."
"15097590","15100490"," Dude, I would, I used to pay for subscriptions, right?"
"15101330","15104570"," And I'd get into a room and you'd like, you'd see him come and go."
"15104730","15105970"," People just come and go burn accounts. "
"15106790","15110830"," New traders, new investors, come in to pay, pay, pay and they'd be gone."
"15110830","15113190"," Be there a week gone, month gone, year gone."
"15113990","15119090"," You know, the core group people and the alpha guy in that room would be, you know, it was all"
"15119090","15121230"," about pumping, getting more blood into the room. "
"15121810","15122410"," I didn't like that."
"15122530","15123710"," It was kind of poisonous, man."
"15123850","15124910"," It's not a good way to live life. "
"15131930","15133370"," Yeah, I'm being honest with you guys."
"15133570","15135090"," This is 100% honesty."
"15135690","15136990"," This is 100%. "
"15136990","15138570"," This is not, you guys hear me talking."
"15138770","15141090"," I'm not like chipping over words or anything like that."
"15141470","15142210"," This is all true. "
"15142510","15143010"," All real."
"15146590","15147110"," All real."
"15147350","15149470"," So, I don't know how to say to you guys. "
"15149610","15150630"," I love all you guys out there."
"15150690","15151210"," I want you to know that."
"15151390","15152770"," Like, if we shut up this channel then, right?"
"15153470","15156230"," I'll fucking be friends with you guys just on fucking Twitter and hang out. "
"15156410","15157410"," Like, I love all of you."
"15158050","15160410"," I love the ones, I love the ones out there they disagree with."
"15160750","15161890"," Like, I fucking love all you guys. "
"15162890","15170610"," Look at this isn't like, it's so fucking bizarre because we're not bizarre."
"15170910","15172550"," I know that people, this is what their profession is."
"15172550","15173750"," This isn't my profession. "
"15175290","15177190"," This is my like, fucking hang out time."
"15177390","15179430"," I just want to make it so pays for itself."
"15180310","15183130"," And it's worth being here with the people that are here. "
"15183370","15185650"," And of course, pay for the service that's being done."
"15186450","15190950"," So it's a very, very, that's a very, I don't know."
"15191330","15192570"," You know, I was talking to a friend yesterday. "
"15192830","15194610"," I said, I sound like a cake eater."
"15195090","15196790"," I sound like I want my cake and eat it too."
"15198030","15199550"," It's such a fucked up thing. "
"15201110","15202490"," You know, it's such a fucked up thing."
"15202790","15203230"," So whatever."
"15203810","15205970"," And of course, you're pushed into it by payment processors. "
"15206730","15207930"," You're fucking pushed it dude."
"15208190","15209010"," Like, even Twitter."
"15209890","15210690"," Twitter, dude. "
"15210850","15214810"," If I was a nice guy on Twitter, I would have like 20, 30,000 followers."
"15215770","15217190"," But I'm real, I'm real on Twitter."
"15217890","15218950"," So what do I have to do, right?"
"15219250","15220370"," I try to grow the business. "
"15220590","15220870"," What do I do?"
"15221390","15226950"," You start to see Captain Jim be like, no more swearing, no more honesty, no more calling people"
"15226950","15227190"," out."
"15227190","15230010"," No more, like, no more making a call on something."
"15230590","15232510"," Like, all that shit is what makes me who I am. "
"15236260","15237440"," Shit, it's so fucked up."
"15244620","15245300"," You know what I mean?"
"15247520","15249580"," Yeah, you can't help but be real on Twitter, right, Winky?"
"15250200","15251100"," Like, I can't help it."
"15251700","15252580"," Can you imagine me?"
"15252740","15255920"," Like, after like, after like two or three months of this shit, I'd have like a freak out or"
"15255920","15256220"," something. "
"15259160","15260080"," I couldn't do it."
"15260220","15260840"," Like, I can't do it."
"15260920","15261400"," I can't do it. "
"15261440","15262380"," I swear to God, I can't straight."
"15262380","15264360"," I can't straight lie to someone."
"15264560","15267800"," I can't sit there and be like, I'm just going to fucking lie to these people. "
"15268040","15268800"," I can't do it."
"15271120","15273220"," But there are some motherfuckers that can."
"15273500","15276040"," There are people out there that can without blinking an eye. "
"15276940","15277460"," You know?"
"15281810","15285030"," That doesn't mean you don't lie in your life, but I mean, like, full-face lies."
"15285230","15289270"," Like, I'm going to ride it as motherfuckers for gain or profit or any of that kind of nonsense."
"15290050","15290970"," Just no need, man. "
"15291430","15292210"," It really isn't."
"15292210","15293190"," There's no fucking need."
"15296320","15297940"," We got some tapies down here. "
"15297940","15300220"," We got the bears that are getting all bears over here."
"15300880","15302400"," There's like, sundered down cap."
"15302880","15303840"," Let's get below that. "
"15304040","15304920"," Let's get below cap."
"15305760","15306600"," Send it down cap."
"15307400","15308300"," Oh, look at that. "
"15308480","15309120"," Look at this."
"15310180","15311120"," Look at those bears."
"15311420","15312700"," I want to buy this, believe it or not. "
"15313320","15315080"," I might buy this, believe it or not."
"15315420","15317720"," We'll take a look and see how weak we get to the end of the day here."
"15319460","15321220"," Let's see how much pain we can cause. "
"15322220","15325800"," We got some put buyers down here."
"15325940","15327640"," Let's see if we can hold support down in here."
"15328360","15329080"," Oh, look at that. "
"15329200","15330420"," We might have some support down here."
"15330480","15331020"," Wait a minute."
"15331800","15332660"," Down here now. "
"15332960","15333680"," The real buyers."
"15334060","15335600"," Just so you know, real buyers are down here, 414."
"15337200","15339520"," We've got some decent support here at VWAP. "
"15340420","15342640"," But the buyers are leading you down right now."
"15343520","15344480"," Be aware of that."
"15344600","15346060"," There could be a little bit more capitulation in here. "
"15346820","15349460"," Well, there's 414 level real quick that we're seeing here."
"15350720","15351640"," Or it's 414."
"15352680","15353540"," Oh, shit. "
"15355460","15355940"," Damn."
"15357000","15359460"," The little bastards are leading you down here."
"15362760","15364080"," I think they're down here. "
"15365760","15366840"," Yeah, it's hard to."
"15367360","15367780"," You got it."
"15367920","15368380"," You got it. "
"15370480","15371140"," You got fucked up."
"15371300","15371740"," It's not me."
"15371900","15372140"," It's hard. "
"15372500","15373860"," The whole thing is set up."
"15374240","15382360"," The whole setup from the social media companies that want you to do."
"15382360","15384320"," The payment services that are out there. "
"15384480","15389340"," Like everything is set up for them to take your money and for them to pump their platform and look"
"15389340","15390040"," good in their platform."
"15390340","15391080"," I understand that."
"15391180","15395040"," They want their platform to be classy, clean and safe and all that kind of stuff. "
"15395780","15399180"," And they, you know, like when you get people out there with big accounts, like the people with"
"15399180","15401960"," followers, like a million followers, half million followers."
"15402380","15403660"," You never hear them do that stuff."
"15403800","15405160"," They want those people on their platforms. "
"15406420","15408120"," I get why they want all that."
"15408340","15409080"," I understand that."
"15409400","15410220"," I understand that. "
"15410880","15411900"," That was my profession."
"15413120","15417160"," My profession back in the day was you'd have people like that running a business."
"15418380","15422640"," I'm not going to tell you what business I was in, but you know, there was all these claims all"
"15422640","15422920"," the time. "
"15423040","15427000"," Then of course the books would come out and you'd find out that it was all fucking wise and so"
"15427000","15428080"," you'd have to go in there and clean house."
"15432140","15434800"," So that's my personality and I'm a helper too."
"15434800","15438600"," So I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm going to go in there and make sure that I'm fixing this for people. "
"15447460","15451120"," I'm just thinking about this right now, how it's translating into what I'm doing right now."
"15452580","15453420"," It's kind of funny."
"15454460","15454900"," Okay. "
"15457020","15459320"," So let's clean this shitty chart up a little bit."
"15460400","15460840"," Right?"
"15464540","15466220"," There's a nice little bull flag over here."
"15466460","15467200"," Not quite a failure. "
"15467460","15468160"," Double top over here."
"15468340","15469100"," Double top over here."
"15469320","15469660"," Same cell. "
"15470580","15470860"," One top."
"15471060","15471280"," One top."
"15472560","15473040"," Two top cell. "
"15474260","15475980"," We've got the support being built in here."
"15475980","15477760"," Down here between 414."
"15478980","15480400"," That box he drew earlier. "
"15481040","15482180"," Fake bids down here."
"15483060","15484060"," I'm like, hey, come to me."
"15485860","15490700"," It looks like we have support down here for 16 and 415, but these fake bids are new. "
"15490880","15494280"," This is a buyer down here saying, no, fuck this."
"15494600","15495140"," Come down here."
"15495400","15499220"," And they might just be wanting the bid at 415, 16 or 415. "
"15499860","15505420"," If these fake bids weren't here, probably get a buy up here, but they're bleeding down the bulls"
"15505420","15506000"," down here."
"15506640","15508860"," We've got the Vwop right here."
"15508860","15511400"," It's a natural place to buy a dip, right?"
"15514440","15520460"," So we're going to look down here and see how those fake bidders down below or have they left. "
"15523090","15524170"," And they're still down here."
"15524350","15526750"," They're still waiting down here for 414."
"15527690","15529550"," Wouldn't shock me to see that hit today. "
"15530650","15532610"," Would not shock me to see 414."
"15535420","15536920"," Give it a pretty decent probability."
"15536920","15539980"," We'll give it like 60% chance we go down to 414 today. "
"15546790","15548350"," So you're just back on top of real quick."
"15548470","15550550"," Stop tipping me right now because I don't want them to keep the money."
"15550750","15556050"," If you have tipped me recently, you'll be getting a refund. "
"15556810","15559410"," If you don't get a refund, it means that I've received your money."
"15562370","15568190"," And if you're on one other keynote, if you're on a monthly plan, some of you guys tipped me"
"15568190","15570710"," monthly, which I'm very grateful and appreciate it for."
"15570910","15573950"," Cancel those right away if you're listening right now. "
"15574050","15574930"," Pass along to your friends."
"15576110","15580030"," Cancel any monthly donations for tips."
"15580370","15581510"," And I'm a real legit business. "
"15581830","15586250"," Like everything is, my end is legit from their side wanting me to be legit."
"15586990","15587870"," It doesn't matter."
"15588130","15590170"," It's how they set it all up. "
"15590270","15595190"," They've got agreements with like stream labs and YouTube and you have tipped up and you also have a"
"15595190","15595370"," nonsense."
"15595830","15597510"," And some of them are all owned by the same company."
"15597510","15601450"," They just want you to go through these companies because they can skim more off the top. "
"15602310","15605010"," They don't want me accepting with less of a cut for them."
"15609170","15609910"," So down here, 414."
"15612050","15613610"," This is where your stop losses are. "
"15613810","15616070"," It was a bull, by the way, down here 414."
"15617670","15619990"," You don't want to see a rug pull down here at 414."
"15627920","15629220"," Let's say we buy a V close. "
"15629680","15631160"," Yeah, I'd love to see that V close."
"15631560","15633140"," Hey, let's talk about that."
"15633820","15634680"," 211 in the afternoon. "
"15636520","15638900"," Before we get there, let's do some expectations."
"15642260","15642620"," Expectations."
"15646300","15647540"," So let's just do some exp..."
"15647540","15649280"," Let's get rid of all this crap in here, okay?"
"15649700","15650980"," We already know where it's going, right?"
"15652180","15653100"," We know where it's going. "
"15656250","15656890"," We know where it's going."
"15657690","15658350"," Okay, expectations."
"15659110","15660530"," We got a 2 p.m. tomorrow. "
"15662770","15667520"," 2 p.m. 2 p.m. for us."
"15667640","15669480"," I got just a little bit larger view here."
"15671560","15672980"," Let's look, let's breathe. "
"15674640","15675580"," Where are we?"
"15677220","15679000"," This is lower bound down here."
"15679160","15679900"," This is bad news."
"15681380","15682280"," We have FOMC. "
"15682440","15683620"," We still have puts on the board over here."

"15696710","15699550"," I think it's going to compress down in here, just like this. "
"15701510","15703190"," Maybe a capitulation moment."
"15703190","15705930"," And there's your blast off."

"15718570","15721590"," Trade up to $4.18 or $4.20. They're going to sell it down on you. "
"15722790","15724450"," You know, lock y'all in for tomorrow."
"15725790","15728210"," You know, that doesn't mean you'll build premium calls and all that."
"15728390","15729850"," Doesn't mean the bulls aren't in charge in here. "
"15729950","15731150"," It just means that you're locked in."

"16015390","16016610"," bit of panic sound coming into the clothes. "
"16017690","16019970"," Maybe we're running out of runway into the clothes."
"16020470","16021890"," A little bit of runway."
"16024330","16034250"," Somebody QFCNBC, because the markets have to, the markets have to have to digest what our"

"16043450","16045430"," A little bit of a bounce, 4.15, 41."
"16046490","16046930"," Not bad, right?"
"16047810","16048810"," Not a bad entry down here. "
"16050890","16052610"," That's too bad of an entry for a bro."
"16056110","16059470"," Got these fake buyers down here at 4.12 and down to 4.12, we were not."
"16059610","16062370"," There's some fake bidding going on down here. "
"16063330","16064870"," Take-ass bids are moving on down."

"16091730","16092130"," We're a team."
"16095880","16098200"," There's no we in team, but there's a me in team."
"16099180","16100260"," Come on down here. "

"16138440","16139620"," We're down here waiting for you."
"16140380","16144080"," My fake-ass bid is down at 4.14, 4.13. They're raising up a little bit. "
"16144160","16150880"," This is a good thing right here, seeing bids raising up slowly down here at 4.15. Price target down"
"16150880","16153140"," below 4.12. I don't know what we get there."
"16153560","16155160"," We might get to 4.14 still."
"16155700","16160560"," We might see this bid removed to get us to 4.14. You don't want to break that, right?"
"16160740","16161360"," We're breaking through. "
"16161680","16162460"," This is bearish."
"16162560","16163480"," What do we talk about earlier?"
"16164180","16165180"," Remember this afternoon?"
"16166120","16167000"," What did I say to you earlier?"
"16167260","16170360"," I said, if you're a bear, getting all bears down here, right?"
"16171500","16174080"," You look for a bump and a rejection."
"16175180","16180120"," Another way that it can happen if you want to get all bears is a bump, a bump and then"
"16180120","16180460"," a rejection. "
"16181480","16185560"," If you're a bull, you're looking for a slingshot higher here."
"16186640","16191040"," If you're a bull and you buy a dip down here and you want to see it run up, right?"
"16191360","16193140"," Take profit and then pick it back up again."
"16193440","16196940"," Don't not get caught in here because if this goes down, it's going to be fucking nasty. "
"16197900","16200960"," This will burn if this rejects up here."
"16201860","16203860"," This is the setup that bears are looking at."
"16211760","16213620"," This is the setup is what a bear is looking for. "
"16217570","16218870"," Talk this move here."
"16219110","16219770"," You want this move."
"16220850","16222130"," This is the move is a bear. "
"16223570","16228670"," This will be swift and brutal."
"16234500","16236240"," That's their price target down there, 410."
"16239360","16242840"," If you're a bear, mark my words, okay?"
"16244760","16246180"," I don't care if it's here. "
"16249300","16250460"," I don't care if it's here."
"16251360","16253020"," When do you enter this if you're a bear?"
"16253320","16255680"," Over here, okay?"
"16256200","16256700"," Not here."
"16257160","16257620"," Not here. "
"16257780","16258200"," Not here."
"16258700","16261980"," You want to enter that first or second tap over here."
"16262260","16265540"," If it rejects in the way back up, you take that shit all the way down. "
"16271020","16277040"," If this rejects right here, do you see a rejection here?"
"16277240","16278200"," Boom, like this."
"16278660","16279620"," This shit's all the way down."
"16279860","16280740"," This is a high probability. "
"16280880","16284660"," We're inside 10 minutes now that the close are picturing in US energy markets."
"16285060","16287300"," WTI crude futures down about two and a half percent."
"16288120","16290860"," We've Nasdaq fallen to negative territory as well. "
"16292660","16295980"," Russell 2000 holding on again is about a third of percent."
"16297060","16298560"," Well, watch this happen, okay?"
"16298740","16300540"," In real time, watch this happen in real time."
"16302760","16303620"," I'll bring it back and forth. "
"16303800","16307280"," Bringing in presence, the linsky just saying that Ukraine is not retreating."
"16316160","16320320"," De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de "
"16320320","16327440","-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de There you go."
"16327580","16329040"," There's your bears stepping in. "
"16329140","16330160"," They're waiting for you."
"16330580","16333100"," They're prepared for 1612 right here."
"16333720","16334720"," Right where it is. "
"16335380","16336400"," Bears are stepping in."
"16336540","16338960"," They're waiting for a trade higher rejection and down."
"16339520","16340460"," They're already there waiting. "
"16340760","16343100"," They have a limit order right now to sell this shit right here."
"16348900","16350720"," So we'll see if we reverse course here."
"16350900","16352280"," We're still bullish here, believe it or not. "
"16352360","16354740"," This is still on the day, it's bullish."
"16356300","16363240"," So we're looking to see if there's rejection, if there's no that too."
"16363440","16367840"," If this bottom is bought at some point, you're going to expect it 420 swiftly. "
"16368900","16373300"," If this is rejected here, you are looking lower to lower numbers 410."
"16374780","16376420"," Okay, so there's a rejection here."
"16376540","16377640"," Your price target is 410. "
"16378100","16383800"," If there is like a five program that comes in, your price target is 420."
"16387500","16389619"," So we're going to see if this gets rejected up here."
"16389820","16404340"," There's here's a rejection point right here, 416.20. Yeah,"
"16404460","16409360"," you know, the trade that I want, I know the trade I want, I want that. "
"16409580","16413040"," I want that capitulation, bloodbath."
"16414040","16415360"," Everyone's scared of the fed."
"16417040","16417900"," I want that. "
"16420400","16421259"," You know what I want?"
"16421400","16425960"," I want Chase to come out and say, when I want, I want us to trade to 4,000 and"
"16425960","16428419"," have Chase say, should I buy 380Ps?"
"16429400","16431060"," Then I'll buy calls right there and there."
"16433500","16435779"," And then I want, who's an Uber bull here?"
"16437119","16438860"," I want an Uber bull here to tell me."
"16440860","16444779"," I guess you can't do it down here, but if we're at 450 right now, I want an Uber bull"
"16444779","16445580"," to tell me to go 470. "
"16453560","16458140"," Yeah, Tom Pacheco, I want Tom to put that, I want Tom Pacheco at 450."
"16458860","16460700"," He's an over a fucking bill, bull."

"16531939","16533560"," Weary Rome is popping in, dude. "
"16533759","16537900"," So just so you guys know, Weary Rome has made some kick-ass calls."

"16553240","16556140"," I forget when it was, but he was like, this shit ain't holding."
"16556140","16559320"," We're going down like another 200 points and we fucking rolled it down."
"16559800","16561020"," It was nasty. "
"16562200","16563480"," It was nasty."
"16567560","16569380"," Oh, Desperado's getting hungry."

"16628650","16629050"," Buku. "
"16630849","16631669"," Still uninteresting."
"16632029","16633310"," They're not going to lose so much more, I don't think."
"16634410","16635570"," What's Fia Vicks doing?"
"16635770","16636950"," Vicks is curling up to you guys. "
"16637050","16638009"," I want to say you guys something here."

"16648419","16649480"," Vicks is looking nasty."
"16657770","16659050"," That ain't looking pretty over there."
"16659830","16660970"," The Vicks is looking evil. "
"16662050","16663650"," It's just looking evil right there."
"16665810","16666310"," That minimum."
"16667349","16670630"," A Vicks shouldn't top out until, you know, somewhere in here. "
"16671830","16673310"," 331.49 or something."
"16674570","16676029"," It's got a little rejection below it."
"16677150","16680410"," A little place at 3105, but it's got room to run. "
"16681990","16683250"," It's got room to run at 3105."
"16684330","16685630"," It's got room to run at 3149."
"16686610","16690290"," And you know about this one up here, this big bad boy, 3664. "
"16690430","16690669"," That's ugly."
"16691509","16692369"," You don't want to see that."
"16694669","16697869"," Leave himself some room up here to trade higher. "
"16700169","16701710"," We could get a broad bath in our hands."
"16702849","16704110"," You guys ready for a blood bath?"
"16709220","16710140"," We might get one."
"16710560","16711480"," We might be getting a blood bath. "
"16714610","16715390"," We're close to one."
"16716090","16716990"," Just warning out there."
"16717130","16718730"," It's a market warning for you if you're a bull. "
"16719730","16721310"," We're starting to get some rejection here."
"16722570","16723910"," It didn't even make it up high."
"16724210","16725210"," It didn't even get the rejection. "
"16725509","16727310"," It didn't even get the push up."
"16728029","16729849"," When you see this, this is call sellers."
"16730150","16731590"," They're selling calls right now warning. "
"16735070","16740090"," If it starts to dribble down in here, this can be a sign that we're going to dribble straight down."
"16741290","16743169"," Just warning market warning if you're a bull."
"16744250","16745650"," We are at a place right now. "
"16745650","16746790"," We can still trade higher."
"16746930","16747869"," We can still bounce up here."
"16747950","16748750"," We have no dribbling down. "
"16748849","16749430"," We can still do this."
"16749650","16756090"," But warning that this look right here is people going cash."
"16756990","16759930"," Probably people selling calls into the close. "
"16761810","16763770"," Sell some fucking calls into the close."
"16768410","16769890"," Hot hands getting rid of my calls."
"16770210","16772310"," I don't even think they're buying puts. "
"16772490","16774689"," It just looks like people are monetizing."
"16774890","16777990"," Cash gang wait for FOMC into the close."
"16779410","16782750"," It could be some real money selling going on here that we don't know about as well. "
"16783610","16786630"," This is another aspect of the market that we haven't talked too much about."
"16787730","16793930"," That if we break $4,000 or you could see panic selling, that's part of my impetus that we're not"
"16793930","16795030"," going to break $4,000."
"16796390","16798290"," That the Fed's job is to stop that. "
"16798510","16799830"," I don't think we go to below $4,000."
"16799990","16801030"," But you can have some panic."
"16801950","16804750"," You don't have a panic Tesla buyer bought at $850 or something. "
"16805330","16809930"," Kind of lose to $900 and just act their bags and let FOMC slide by and then they buy back"
"16809930","16811250"," anything like that."
"16811390","16814330"," Real money selling on individual tickers in the background."
"16816670","16822990"," Just people being cautious into tomorrow's FOMC. "
"16823870","16825990"," This is a market warning when I issue this."
"16826310","16828770"," This looks like a target to $4,000."
"16830510","16833050"," Not guaranteed high probability. "
"16833350","16835610"," It's starting to shape up like this right here."
"16836910","16839010"," It's starting to shape up like looking for a rejection."
"16840010","16840950"," It's a prime candidate. "
"16841670","16850550"," You're going to want to have some sort of confirmation even if it's just a one pump."
"16850990","16857730"," And if you crude future 7102s, about 41, down about 2.6%. So we'll keep an eye on it here."
"16858590","16861570"," If you're a bear and you want to take a short here, you're going to be looking for rejection. "
"16862730","16864010"," Right on this cross right here."
"16864090","16864550"," You see that cross?"
"16866130","16868370"," You're looking for this rejection right on this cross right here."
"16871040","16872000"," So we'll see if we get it. "
"16875140","16884560"," That price target is $16.06. See if these sellers are up here."
"16886160","16886920"," It's not quite."
"16887700","16888460"," They're still higher. "
"16888640","16889780"," They might be taking the money and run too."
"16889900","16890520"," You can see up here."
"16890700","16891440"," They're not quite there. "
"16893120","16893500"," They're closer."
"16895380","16896860"," Yeah, they're kind of here but not really."
"16898360","16900020"," Bears aren't really committing here either. "
"16901840","16902780"," To be honest with you."
"16902840","16903460"," They're not committing yet."
"16906880","16909020"," We'll pay attention and see if the bears come down to play. "
"16910320","16912000"," Or we'll just another opportunity to buy a dip."
"16913740","16914960"," But they aren't committing yet."
"16916300","16917780"," You'll see a big swoop down. "
"16917920","16920080"," You'll see like 130,000 sellers swoop in."
"16920860","16921880"," We'll see if this holds."
"16924240","16925840"," It's turning bearish right now. "
"16929030","16931150"," Feel like unlock the key to being bearish."
"16932170","16939210"," The break of that flag is the key to unlock the door to be embarrassed."
"16940650","16941970"," And now you're looking for confirmation. "
"16945690","16947790"," If I was getting bearish, this is what I'd be looking for."
"16950400","16951600"," Take a trip down to the bell."

"17621510","17621730"," Remember this."
"17621930","17623510"," There's one bears coming in here and they can take this twice. "
"17623790","17624670"," Okay, be careful in here."
"17625410","17627210"," One, two, big move down."
"17627430","17628310"," Okay, be careful in here. "
"17630530","17634750"," With that being said, you're going to be watching, so you're going to do this quick in case it"

"17635170","17636310"," Don't get fucking rejected here."
"17637350","17641430"," With that being said, okay, be careful. "
"17641770","17641990"," Wait a minute."
"17644520","17649770"," If we reverse, that's right about there."

"17673610","17674050"," Fuck."
"17687370","17690550"," So I sold some calls and I bought some calls down here and sold them."
"17690650","17695250"," They were $1.63, sold them for $1.83. Not as good as I was expecting. "
"17695510","17696490"," I'm kind of pissed off at this trade."
"17696650","17697970"," This trade went for $1.90 here."
"17698210","17701530"," I should have sold it for a quick 25%. "
"17701530","17711190"," Okay, so that's really not it either."
"17711190","17712230"," It's right here."
"17742320","17744480"," 409.410. That's where that is. "
"17745800","17750360"," If it follows, trend it's on right now."
"17758250","17764840"," That is super steep."
"17788380","17790700"," I had a little panic attack there for a minute. "
"17801390","17802470"," I'm not liking this here."
"17802930","17803970"," I'm not liking this at all."
"17803970","17806830"," Like this swoop up and then it didn't blast through here. "
"17807670","17809190"," You see that like fake pump."
"17811090","17814670"," So I bought that right there and then as soon as I saw the reverse, I was like, nah, I'm"
"17814670","17814830"," good."
"17814990","17815210"," I'm thanks. "
"17815470","17816670"," I'll just wait and see what happens down here."
"17817130","17818990"," I'll wait for this to break above and take that higher."
"17819550","17819790"," Too risky. "
"17820930","17820930"," Dangerous."
"17822350","17826950"," I don't want to see this reversal here."
"17832490","17833910"," We'll get rid of the fake ass bid. "
"17837130","17840570"," I'm trying to send this lower right now."
"17840670","17840890"," They are."
"17841090","17843670"," I thought they're trying to cover their shorts, cover shorts down here. "
"17844910","17857730"," One, two, those"
"17857730","17862010"," 420s now $2.198. I could have made more money in this trade, but too risky."
"17862310","17863510"," Too fast for me."
"17864170","17866150"," I didn't like the speed at which this happened. "
"17867370","17867970"," Fuck that."
"17868310","17869130"," I'm too fast."
"17870150","17870870"," Too fast. "
"17874190","17876870"," I'll take the fucking 20 cents and be on the merry way."
"17880180","17880800"," Too fast."
"17880960","17881380"," I don't like this. "
"17883240","17884560"," I don't want that huge reversal."
"17884880","17886640"," These two reversals here are violent as fuck."
"17887120","17895400"," I only got a selling down in here. "
"17911260","17912020"," Too dangerous."
"17913980","17916720"," Let's see what's going on if the sellers are still up here if they're just fucking around."
"17917100","17917740"," That was fast. "
"17920880","17922100"," Still showing that support."
"17922340","17923320"," This is why I bought down here."
"17923480","17924840"," This support down here is pretty fair. "
"17925040","17926520"," So you guys looking at this support down here?"
"17926540","17927880"," It's pretty fucking fairs right there."
"17928020","17929800"," Buyers are waiting down here for 13."
"17932110","17933530"," They're towing the line down here. "
"17933610","17937290"," They're telling you they ain't fucking going nowhere, but I don't like this down here."
"17937370","17940770"," I don't like seeing this down here for 10."
"17951530","17953770"," These fucking bears are fucking something else. "
"17954310","17956350"," They just want to turn some shit on it."
"17956470","17958450"," When they turn it on, it's like bam."
"17961560","17963080"," Fucking bastards. "
"17968630","17974110"," That was straight up fucking straight up hidden sellers right above."
"17976990","17977430"," Scary."
"17984140","17985740"," See if they're still up there at all. "
"17986000","17986940"," I don't see them there dude."
"17987120","17987440"," They're hiding."
"17988520","17990060"," These fucking bears are crazy. "
"18002500","18003700"," Crazy ass bears."
"18006100","18007200"," They're still there too."
"18007400","18008420"," They're still fucking hiding there. "
"18008540","18010200"," They're claiming they're up at 420, but they're not."
"18010380","18011580"," They're fucking right there ready."
"18015210","18017350"," These little shit don't want the market to go up. "
"18017470","18038570"," They don't want to get down."
"18038570","18040490"," I'm not in calls right now, but they're down 220."
"18040990","18042490"," They were $1.60 at one point. "
"18043430","18045450"," I don't have the diamond hands for that trade right there."
"18046610","18047390"," No way."
"18047910","18050310"," I'm scared of the reversal, the second reversal right now. "
"18053840","18054740"," No fucking way."
"18064320","18065760"," I missed that trade huge."
"18071650","18073630"," No diamond hands for me in that trade. "
"18077540","18078680"," This swooped right in."
"18078780","18080220"," That was fast as fuck."
"18083360","18085740"," That was like, that was some computer trading right there. "
"18089060","18091700"," And they're not showing themselves here right now either."
"18093930","18095430"," They're not showing that they're here."
"18095630","18097230"," They're showing that they're gone, but they're here. "
"18098390","18102910"," They're presenting themselves as being at like, even right now, they're presenting themselves as"
"18102910","18103450"," being way up here."
"18105290","18106410"," 420 or so."
"18109230","18110610"," They ain't fucking buying it. "
"18111750","18112810"," No fucking way."
"18112930","18113990"," This is a computer running it right now."
"18114930","18115850"," They ain't doing it. "
"18116950","18119990"," I think we could blast off another 100 points right here."
"18120050","18120430"," I ain't doing it."
"18125660","18127000"," That was a crazy shit right there. "
"18127820","18128880"," See how fast that moved."
"18128980","18130020"," Are you guys watching this out there?"
"18131060","18139600"," Are you guys trading this?"
"18151980","18153480"," Mira, what the fuck was that, bro?"
"18157660","18158600"," There was fake news?"
"18159180","18159980"," Yeah, that wasn't normal."
"18161940","18164960"," Apparently it was fake news about Twitter about Fed decision being leaked early. "
"18165220","18168900"," That's what we heard about it."
"18169040","18169780"," Now we haven't heard it."
"18170460","18171660"," But I felt it in the trade. "
"18173600","18175080"," I fucking felt it in the trade."
"18181170","18182390"," I felt it right here."
"18182490","18183650"," This is where I felt it right in here. "
"18184310","18185830"," So I'm trading it on this chart right here."
"18186870","18188350"," So I bought this down here."
"18193620","18199680"," But this move right here was lightning came back up and then I cut it loose right there. "
"18200900","18201740"," So I did all right."
"18201940","18203260"," But this move was lightning."
"18203920","18204740"," This was a computer. "
"18205540","18206400"," This wasn't like humans."
"18210960","18212260"," It wasn't fucking around."
"18212980","18213840"," It was a hair trigger. "
"18216420","18218200"," Mira, you get your setup, bro."
"18222130","18223610"," That big reversal, bro."
"18224810","18225930"," That was some wild shit. "
"18226070","18226630"," I got scared there."
"18227150","18228130"," That spooked the fuck out of me."
"18228190","18229510"," I don't like when computers do that shit. "
"18235840","18237460"," Yeah, that freaks me out."
"18238360","18239940"," I've been in trades with that happens."
"18240440","18242300"," You guys ever been in a trade when the computers take over?"
"18242860","18243580"," Fuck you. "
"18247300","18249620"," Any of them long in a flash crash?"
"18255420","18257140"," That felt like a flash crash moment."
"18257700","18258740"," I was like, motherfucker."
"18259300","18260420"," They're gonna fucking burn me. "
"18263650","18264410"," Yeah, rage dumping."
"18267170","18268630"," Don't let me be able to throw up right there."
"18272120","18273160"," I'm not gonna lie. "
"18275080","18277720"," That one little move for like two or three minutes in here."
"18279460","18287930"," It was right around two forty six animals shot myself."
"18293120","18295080"," That was like high frequency trading right there. "
"18295160","18298280"," That was like a fucking somebody hit the cell button like city group."
"18306580","18307680"," I'll do that on Twitter."
"18308300","18361260"," So I just fake"
"18361260","18361980"," news on Twitter. "
"18365390","18366170"," I don't doubt that."
"18366410","18367650"," Something triggered it."
"18367790","18368270"," That was a trigger. "
"18368530","18369110"," That wasn't like."
"18370690","18382410"," That was something pretty"
"18382410","18384390"," FMC FMC leaks."
"18384390","18385710"," 35 VPS high confirmed. "
"18387250","18387790"," No."
"18393050","18393590"," No."
"18393990","18400140"," So in here, this move right here was so fast. "
"18400400","18403480"," This was this was really fast."
"18404140","18405220"," Really fast."
"18405880","18407060"," This is a computer doing this. "
"18407200","18408960"," It doesn't show well on the chart."
"18410080","18416780"," But as it was happening, when I was looking inside the options chain, that's pretty fucking"
"18416780","18417040"," violent."
"18420640","18423340"," Thanks for the heads up drink drink tell. "
"18426480","18436780"," Yeah, there's"
"18436780","18438040"," no 75 BPS."
"18438200","18438820"," You fucking retired."
"18439160","18439940"," That's not happening. "
"18441800","18445720"," If anything, you'll get a you'll get a hawkish tone and all that stuff."

"18448680","18453440"," Even the even like the players like the the internal players of the market."
"18456300","18457520"," Don't believe that's happening."
"18458900","18460060"," They think it should happen. "
"18460060","18462180"," But they're like, that's not the function of the fed."
"18462320","18463520"," It's not what they're going to do."
"18464700","18467180"," That these people are like, we want this to happen. "
"18468080","18470940"," Well, they're like, they want it to happen, but they know that it can't happen in the credit"
"18470940","18471280"," market."
"18471300","18473200"," They have to still support the credit market."
"18474400","18475540"," Oh, yeah, I'm long here. "
"18477300","18478540"," I'm blasting off here."
"18486740","18487840"," Taking this bit higher."

"18748700","18751580"," See if we can grab at least a 418 flat on this."
"18770440","18771900"," That was some wild shit right there."
"18775530","18776090"," Come on, baby. "
"18779280","18781020"," Get up to 428, just give me 418."

"18854480","18861820"," People are passing around some Bloomberg estimates for tomorrow. "
"18865990","18872150"," President Biden visiting a Lockheed Martin facility saying that Russia is committing atrocities and"

"18876390","18877650"," Just to give you guys a heads up."
"18878570","18884630"," That the Bloomberg terminal is saying that the estimate for tomorrow is 75%. "
"18885870","18895590"," Now people are taking that as a 75 BPS for added on"
"18895590","18897230"," to 25%."
"18897230","18904050"," What it is is we've already at 25% and it means they're adding on another 50%."
"18904050","18910040"," The low estimate though is 50%. "
"18910040","18911440"," Not bad."
"18911680","18913920"," If we were to get 50%, that's adding another 25."
"18921520","18925160"," And the crazy part is that the median is at 75, too. "
"18932150","18938810"," And what happened was there was a Twitter user, George Gaven, G-U-R-D-A-V-I "

"19022990","19025050"," So I'm gonna sell here, take the money and run. "
"19026090","19031070"," My price target is right here, this 418."
"19032270","19035310"," We can trade it higher here, but I'm taking profit right here, okay?"
"19035310","19035370"," Okay."
"19038110","19039790"," Now we can trade higher than here. "
"19039970","19040810"," This is where I'm taking profit."
"19042250","19043650"," So I caught some of this at least."
"19044710","19046090"," This is a nice full trade. "
"19046330","19053850"," If you're able, if you want to dive in and hand this shit down here, congrats to you."

"19056130","19057330"," It's a good trade though. "
"19057450","19061510"," That's two good trades at least, not bangers though, but decently paying trades."
"19065700","19070780"," So basically the consensus is that we're going up, we're adding 50 BPS, okay?"
"19071880","19072780"," So that's the consensus."
"19073360","19078100"," Now if everyone thinks we're gonna add, we're gonna add 75 BPS tomorrow. "
"19078660","19079940"," I'm sure there'll be people saying that."
"19088580","19090980"," Still some strong resistance above from here to 420."
"19092180","19093660"," I'm starting to roll it over slightly here. "
"19096760","19102600"," I have the same conviction into tomorrow that we're gonna pin to, not pin to 420, that we're gonna"
"19102600","19105380"," top out of 420, trade it lower into tomorrow."
"19105380","19107240"," Nothing's changed for me here at this point."
"19107860","19111200"," I'm not willing to take a long hair, like I'm not going long into tomorrow. "
"19111260","19114320"," We've got 309 P.L. 50 minute."

"19152870","19155350"," I only put it on afterwards. "
"19156170","19158710"," When the market's over, I turn it back on and I watch it alone."
"19162670","19164550"," I just burned down the porn just then."
"19165770","19166910"," So they're rolling over there. "
"19167050","19167550"," Nice little trade."
"19168250","19169510"," I didn't capture all of it."
"19169570","19170390"," I missed some of this trade. "
"19171690","19173090"," This is a great trade right here."
"19173910","19177090"," There was a moment in this trade where I got really scared in here."
"19178890","19183610"," It was definitely, this was definitely a triggered sell. "
"19183790","19185950"," This must have caught the attention of someone."
"19186190","19192070"," If I frequent trading firm caught this, keywords are probably floating around Twitter and boom, we"
"19192070","19194070"," had a quick sell until it could be confirmed."
"19195390","19202510"," Now, us trading up higher at this point is saying, it's basically saying to you that the"
"19204660","19209740"," expectation is that we're gonna get 50 BPS tomorrow. "
"19212680","19216720"," If that is the case, then we're priced in for this."
"19218040","19220040"," If that's the case, we're priced in for this."
"19220720","19222860"," Next question becomes QT, right?"
"19223620","19224520"," Do they add QT?"
"19224940","19230580"," If they announce full bore QT across the board in all markets, it's gonna be a problem. "
"19231600","19237680"," So you want to be hearing reporters asking questions tomorrow about trying to mark some of these"
"19237680","19238660"," sports betting names."
"19239040","19243700"," We're seeing a report from Twitter that the California Online Sports betting initiative backed by"
"19244560","19253740"," FanDuel, DraftKings, and MGM has qualified for a November ballot, Dr. Keelan, November golf."
"19259090","19269940"," DKNG Rippin, they're at 1526 earlier, trading higher now again, 1526, 1527"
"19269940","19272360"," now, 1528 on DKNG. "
"19274900","19276980"," DKNG alert on some good news."

"19281820","19285360"," Now, trading 1529 on DKNG. "
"19299060","19301040"," Lots of buyers here on DKNG."
"19301240","19302220"," They would need to squeeze higher."
"19302380","19303260"," This is a squeeze point. "
"19304260","19305800"," We'll load this up the last six hours."
"19309720","19310880"," See if it squeezes here or not."
"19316600","19318780"," Be careful of these sellers above here. "
"19325520","19328000"," Lots of buyers coming in right now in DKNG."
"19335940","19336860"," Unusual going to squeeze."
"19371610","19377550"," If it squeezes here, price target above 1572. "
"19377710","19378350"," That's huge."
"19378570","19379450"," It's a big move for them."
"19382600","19383400"," Possible $16. "
"19385040","19387060"," You might not want to get caught in this could get dangerous."
"19388080","19390140"," These kind of things, they turn around fast."
"19390380","19393480"," Just be careful out there if you're going to trade this DKNG news. "
"19418250","19425180"," 1750 would be top on DKNG."
"19436030","19442170"," The news on DKNG at this point, let me see if I can get it in post it."
"19446480","19449160"," Just rumors of a deal on DKNG. "
"19449280","19449960"," It looks like a vote."
"19468900","19470280"," I'm interested in the trade."
"19479970","19481770"," It's swung from a low down here, right?"
"19481890","19484190"," It's a low of 1306 through four days ago. "
"19484790","19486490"," It's looking pretty fucking bullish over here."
"19487290","19488450"," It's going to explode higher."
"19490630","19495570"," President Biden speaking at the Lockheed Martin plan, it again calls on Congress to pass the bill"

"19518710","19520430"," Okay, so let's just say a look here, right?"
"19520910","19522910"," Have that nice high up here, rejection."
"19523210","19523790"," We have two ejects."
"19523850","19524930"," One, two, sold it down. "
"19525410","19526770"," One, two, sold it down."
"19527270","19530530"," One, two, do we go up or do we sell it down?"
"19531390","19534350"," Do we have any shorts that close today on news tomorrow?"
"19537040","19541620"," You've got the Bloomberg terminal screenshots going out there for people."
"19551450","19553890"," I'm not taking along into the close today. "
"19554770","19555570"," You can."
"19557410","19558610"," I took this long."
"19558610","19560070"," I took two longs down here. "
"19560290","19561790"," I haven't traded anything all day long."
"19561930","19563590"," I don't like the consolidation in here."
"19564090","19573090"," I'm going to wait for tomorrow and look for an entry, a real long entry like with substantial money"
"19573090","19576070"," down here or a spread down here on Wednesday. "
"19576970","19578350"," 3 17 in the afternoon."
"19578950","19580330"," Thank you for tuning in today."
"19580430","19582410"," I'll be here with you till 4 p.m. today. "
"19589490","19591350"," Let's check it on DKNG."
"19595200","19597500"," They keep trying to tap this."
"19597660","19598660"," They're not able to, right?"
"19599200","19601040"," This is 1526 over here. "
"19601480","19605820"," A lot of sellers above they're saying, hell no, you're not going up there."
"19605920","19607160"," 16 those next target."
"19610300","19611440"," Let's turn it out. "
"19616390","19617810"," This is extremely bullish."
"19617970","19619030"," You see a move like this?"
"19622380","19623660"," This is very bullish, right?"
"19623780","19627380"," They're pushing this up trying to get to a specific price point."
"19628360","19629940"," Of course, it can get squeezed here. "
"19630060","19630940"," It can sell off, right?"
"19631000","19632080"," If we break here, it sells."
"19632940","19636940"," You want to buy anything below this white line right here."
"19640440","19644320"," We saw on the 16 bucks. "
"19645160","19647160"," We had like 17 in change or something."
"19649360","19650880"," So 17 right here."
"19651000","19651780"," It's a bull set though. "
"19652840","19663550"," Even in a ticker that is trading down somewhere"
"19663550","19663830"," in there."
"19664910","19666010"," You can see it right there."
"19668150","19671010"," Not really looking for a rejection on a larger timeframe. "
"19675370","19677550"," Bullish, but not bullish."
"19678410","19680130"," Anything past this line right here, right?"
"19680250","19681810"," This is a downward channel, right?"
"19683290","19685430"," You can pick the trade back up above it and take it higher."
"19685990","19692190"," But at least in the short term, it's not unreasonable to expect a price target above. "
"19699240","19701020"," I don't think it's unreasonable to expect this."
"19703790","19707130"," If those rumors turn out to be true, I should say, right?"
"19709430","19719940"," Rumor based news right there."
"19725580","19728060"," There's more than likely going to be some rejection here at $16. "
"19728720","19731260"," So it might be more something like this."
"19735480","19743180"," You see a squeeze higher, another consolidation, and then you target up there possibly something"
"19743180","19743580"," like that."
"19743720","19745320"," It could go, but it could just blast off there too. "
"19745500","19751620"," But 17 doesn't seem reasonable if that news is real, the rumors that are flying."
"19752020","19753800"," Trade the news when they talk about rumors."
"19755080","19757420"," They try to verify the veracity of them. "
"19758160","19760460"," So it looks like there's some legitimacy to that rumor."
"19761900","19762760"," That would make sense."
"19765880","19768500"," 17 Cs, weeklies. "
"19770100","19772260"," Let's see if there's any interest in those."
"19786180","19787380"," I don't know, man."
"19787540","19789380"," They might be trying to sell out of their positions here. "
"19790540","19791980"," That rumor might have been."
"19795180","19800960"," There's interest on, they haven't earnings important stuff, but the 16 C has a lot of interest."
"19802020","19803760"," 67 cents widespread on it. "
"19803900","19808580"," 67.71 cents for May 6th."
"19811860","19824400"," May 13th are all the money, $14.50 for $1.61, $68 total lotto"
"19824400","19825080"," ticket."
"19825580","19830220"," We'll see if those print those, $16.16 for 66 cents. "
"19830460","19840660"," There's 7,000 contracts out there on them on"
"19840660","19840880"," rumors."
"19859680","19861580"," Good thing we still calls up here, huh?"
"19875410","19876190"," Don't worry about it, Matt."
"19876370","19877470"," You'll be getting a refund, brother. "
"19878770","19880350"," You'll have a refund here in the next few days."
"19880410","19881230"," You'll get a refund."
"19881550","19883710"," I'll have another way to tip though. "
"19885590","19893090"," I'll have another way for you to tip, but I'm going to be refunding you in the, I'm trying to"
"19893090","19896050"," have to have to, what I have to do there."
"19897870","19898950"," Dude, what's up with the porn?"
"19904120","19904780"," What's up with YouTube?"
"19906140","19906620"," Here we go."
"19914230","19915770"," Am I streaming in 720?"
"19917510","19918630"," I didn't even realize that. "
"19919810","19923770"," I have to check back and make sure I'm streaming in 10, 20."
"19924130","19926430"," And I got to check that tonight."
"19927150","19928790"," I'm streaming in 720 right now. "
"19928810","19932190"," I should be streaming in 1080 right now."
"19934350","19936670"," So that must be my streamlabs as I'll fuck up right now."
"19937330","19939450"," So I'll make sure that I'm streaming in 1080 for you tomorrow. "
"19943440","19945540"," Right here, you get this little bit of sell right here, right?"
"19945780","19946800"," Told you to sell up in here."
"19948640","19949080"," 418."
"19950560","19953240"," You can grab another, another banger in here. "
"19953440","19955600"," And realistically, we're going to solve for the closing of you."
"19958960","19961340"," Or at least try to hold 415 in the bell."
"19979280","19981640"," If you sold calls when I sold calls, you're welcome. "
"19985300","19986060"," You're welcome."
"19992060","19995500"," You're welcome."
"19998480","20000940"," That was ugly right there. "
"20001060","20001580"," How that was nasty."
"20002340","20003280"," Rolled it right over."
"20003460","20003960"," Tiss it. "
"20004560","20005120"," Then bye-bye."
"20006220","20007000"," This is V-wop."
"20007000","20008420"," Try to play the V-wop trade here. "
"20008560","20009960"," These are day traders and a day traders."
"20011160","20015200"," Question becomes, we have a buy side or south side of balance in the market."
"20016080","20018440"," Let's look at the whole market here and see what's going on. "
"20021730","20023950"," And I'll tell you what, there's still buyers down here."
"20024090","20024590"," I don't like that."
"20026410","20028230"," They're still waiting for a softball catch. "
"20028230","20030470"," There was a dip buy there just currently on spy."
"20033960","20034700"," I don't know."
"20034900","20036100"," I don't need this whole trade. "
"20036260","20036980"," I'll be honest with you."
"20037820","20039740"," I don't need to win the entire move."
"20041080","20045000"," I feel like just buying calls staying at the bell and at 4 o'clock. "
"20045260","20046400"," I'm going to be up all night long."
"20049110","20049770"," I'm going to be panicking."
"20052460","20058410"," If we're looking at a larger time frame, how much this move do you need?"
"20061380","20062080"," We're right here, right?"
"20062740","20064100"," Do you need this whole move?"
"20065300","20067680"," If you need this whole move, then get some spreads. "
"20068880","20071740"," If you want this with just buying calls, you have to wait."
"20072240","20073060"," You don't have to."
"20073400","20074440"," Take as much risk as you want. "
"20075040","20077620"," If you're like, I want to buy calls with a bell cap."
"20079360","20082900"," The safest way to do it is to wait for the bell."
"20084360","20085140"," Add some calls. "
"20085400","20086080"," Don't go full tilt."
"20086520","20087500"," Add 10%."
"20087500","20090140"," Then like 10% it opens tomorrow. "
"20090140","20094920"," Then another 10% later in the day and then build into that position heading up to 430."
"20096200","20101880"," Don't go full like don't don't fall port this that trade into tomorrow."
"20101880","20103380"," You can just get data burn in that trade. "
"20103560","20106920"," Do you tell you what this if this market doesn't go up to be now tomorrow, right?"
"20108140","20112440"," The intrinsic value of zero dates are tomorrow are going to fucking burn."
"20114180","20122690"," Burn and another trick didn't that trick but another mechanic in the market would be if they know"
"20122690","20127630"," all these people in 420s, they could burn them all to the ground tomorrow and force you to buy 420s"
"20127630","20129690"," on a discount for Friday tomorrow."
"20131110","20132950"," So get caught in that trap and go in tomorrow. "
"20137400","20140000"," That frequently happens in these type of events."
"20141940","20143660"," So I'm not saying we're not going to gap up or anything."
"20143820","20149380"," I'm just saying be prudent if you're going to take this long into the bell. "
"20150540","20152280"," I think we trade sideways and down."
"20152420","20153180"," We have all day long."
"20153780","20155460"," So one big trade sideways and down. "
"20157860","20162200"," If you want to put some risk out there in case we trade over the night, I understand that."
"20162300","20163520"," I respect that 100%."
"20163520","20166340"," We don't get too many chances down here to buy a dip. "
"20167200","20168980"," So we're going to throw a little bit on for tomorrow."
"20169340","20174900"," If you're going to throw a little bit on for tomorrow, I would say keep them at zero dates and"
"20174900","20179660"," keep them in the money and maybe wait until the bell in here and throw them on."
"20184480","20192980"," You could buy them here, but you got 30 minutes left for for all kinds of"
"20192980","20196840"," pinky-panky stuff going on in here, right?"
"20197600","20199920"," If you buy them here, then you're down here owning them. "
"20200540","20202960"," I like the idea of 415 buying them, too, into the bell."
"20207850","20209550"," Or maybe you wait and laugh for the bell."
"20210950","20211850"," They might get cheaper. "
"20215360","20222540"," For a 416-91-93 or so, let's see where the buyers are, intraday at least."
"20222960","20227280"," They're at 415-18, 415-40, 14."
"20233250","20235030"," Not a lot holding it up going into the bell. "
"20237560","20239760"," More sellers than buyers right now, buy side imbalance."
"20241380","20242520"," Excuse me, a sell side imbalance."
"20247490","20249630"," Not a huge amount, but there is a sell side imbalance. "
"20252450","20254350"," See those seller stepping in right now, above?"
"20254690","20256470"," See them on the right hand side of your screen?"
"20258650","20260590"," There's some seller selling going on right now."
"20265520","20266220"," Yeah, they do."
"20266720","20267780"," They do suck it out. "
"20267940","20273270"," They're going to do a video on that."
"20274290","20275410"," How to trade end of day."
"20275690","20277870"," All the different stuff you have to look for at end of day trading. "
"20281980","20290980"," It's one place that I'm either looking for really cheap stuff or if it prints into the 415, doesn't"
"20290980","20297160"," matter if I buy it at 3.45 pm, but at 415 if I printed a ton off it, oftentimes"
"20297160","20298940"," I just take the money off the table and walk."
"20301160","20302160"," I've been known to do that."
"20302700","20308020"," Let's say we trade down to the bell and then it slams straight to the moon. "
"20309480","20312560"," After hours, I'll take the money and run."
"20313500","20318980"," Let's say we trade up into the bell from a low to last 15 minutes."
"20319060","20320000"," We just go blasting off. "
"20320220","20322740"," I usually take that money up the table before you even get into the bell."
"20323400","20327240"," That's mostly because we'll retrace that shit by morning normally."
"20329370","20333830"," Like that retrace move that happens and you're like diving in it for two, three days, they give all"
"20333830","20334430"," that shit back. "
"20335310","20339750"," If there's program buying into the bell, oftentimes that shit retraces next day."
"20343430","20348110"," If there's a carnage into the bell, that's like a 5050 proposition."
"20349610","20351210"," You have to look at a larger time frame. "
"20352370","20356890"," On a larger time frame, if it's a capitulation moment, I'll buy that fucking bell every time."
"20357410","20362350"," If it's like first day of capitulation or from the middle capitulation, I might not buy that bell"
"20362350","20365650"," because the low liquidity environment will send it lower."
"20366950","20369790"," The best buy on that is usually the second day at the open. "
"20374870","20379370"," Another thing I'll trade at close is if we have big ERs, big ones."
"20381050","20384730"," I'll be looking for weakness into the bell and then I'll buy the bell just after it."
"20385670","20390970"," Or if there's fear first minute or two where it dumps and then I'll grab it and wait for the"
"20390970","20393370"," report to come out and it'll blast off. "
"20395210","20406080"," Also another key point if you hate picking individuals tickers for ERs, find an index that"
"20406080","20412260"," your ER is heavily weighted in and trade that instead and you just say why?"
"20412520","20414820"," It's because you can trade it after the four o'clock hour."
"20415380","20419500"," You can trade it at four o'clock until 4.15. Apple's prime example."
"20419900","20426160"," Amazon prime example is no reason unless you're doing strangles, straddles, you should be selling"
"20426160","20430300"," everything or maybe you're holding a long put spread or call spread the month out. "
"20430900","20435180"," So you have to deal with interest in those options and those options but otherwise if you're like"
"20435180","20441100"," I'm buying calls on Apple for buying fucking you know 180s tonight that doesn't work."
"20442040","20445840"," Then if you think Apple's going up and you have a conviction on that you can buy let's say spy"
"20445840","20451860"," calls on a conviction play and you'll probably print those high chance you'll print them you"
"20451860","20454240"," probably print them between four and four fifteen."
"20455020","20458620"," So you don't even have to hold until next morning to find out if it sells off. "
"20459200","20461940"," You can literally make the money in the trade for like 15 minutes."
"20463280","20467280"," That's a high probability of trade on a conviction trade on an individual ticker."
"20476030","20478550"," Dude what is with these best adult cams?"
"20478930","20479890"," They're pouring in today. "
"20480510","20482510"," I gotta find out, anybody know how that happens?"
"20485430","20487410"," Best adult dating cams?"
"20491020","20491620"," Pornography?"
"20493140","20494820"," I'll do child abuse, port."
"20504080","20507380"," Promotes terrorism or I report that one."
"20510120","20513240"," Uh report so we report this one, report for what?"
"20515260","20517760"," Uh pornography, there you go, report that one. "
"20520000","20526620"," And then we'll report this one, report this one for suicide and self-injury, okay."
"20527820","20532340"," Report that one, and report this one for child abuse."
"20533240","20533960"," That was a good one. "
"20540400","20541800"," Let me tell Spy to come to daddy."
"20543240","20545540"," Yeah I can check EDOC for you."
"20548170","20550950"," Trade in 416-52, look at TDOC. "
"20553330","20555030"," Teladoc, Teladoc took too much of a hit."
"20559280","20561360"," It's like a bullshit with the clothes right now on Spy."
"20564650","20567270"," Teladoc took a little bit too much of a hit and there you are. "
"20569650","20571870"," But that looked like re-pricing to me more than anything."
"20572130","20574770"," It looked like a reason to get long on TDOC."
"20575210","20578330"," You know when you see shit like this, I hope you're honest with you. "
"20579390","20580210"," Everyone's rips on TDOC."
"20580650","20582250"," I think even Winky hates them."
"20582890","20584150"," It's probably out there listening right now. "
"20584190","20586210"," He's like fuck he's going boros on TDOC."
"20588880","20589660"," That's like a TDOC."
"20589880","20590980"," High of 308, they're down. "
"20591340","20594400"," Look at this, this is insane."
"20598030","20598550"," 2875."
"20600050","20601270"," Way down here, 2017. "
"20602330","20602890"," That's a little ridiculous."
"20603850","20605250"," It's a little ridiculous."
"20609440","20611460"," But you see it's being bought now right away. "
"20611600","20613020"," You see these volume bars over here."
"20613120","20614380"," You see these volume bars down here?"
"20614600","20615280"," This ain't retail."
"20616260","20617380"," That ain't retail. "
"20617840","20619860"," That ain't retail and that ain't retail."
"20620800","20623080"," That is not retail buying this down here."
"20624720","20630060"," Those are banks that told you up here, TDOC sucks. "
"20631100","20632060"," They pumped it on the news."
"20632980","20634600"," They hired a short company."
"20635800","20637720"," Over here they paid off. "
"20637920","20638520"," I'm serious."
"20638860","20639460"," This is how it happens."
"20640440","20646620"," They short that they accumulated, distributed it, made their money by telling you. "
"20647980","20649140"," And they said fuck it."
"20649200","20653300"," We're going to buy it down here and then we're going to bring out some good news for TDOC."
"20656250","20657790"," I like TDOC down here. "
"20658310","20660390"," I think it's insane not to have TDOC down here."
"20660790","20663810"," It's like the oldest medical telephone company in the world."
"20664150","20665010"," That's I have to say. "
"20666070","20670850"," It's not that it has to be three and a bucks, but I think it's insane."
"20671170","20672230"," I still do telemedicine."
"20673490","20675030"," So we're going to do TDOC real quick. "
"20679760","20681300"," Let's get fine support down here."
"20683260","20684720"," Fine support down here."
"20685880","20687340"," What do you want to know about TDOC?"
"20687680","20688120"," Just hold. "
"20689720","20690440"," That's all you do."
"20690440","20691860"," That's big support."
"20693600","20694700"," It ain't going nowhere. "
"20696040","20697100"," It ain't going nowhere."
"20697600","20697860"," Tony."
"20699040","20700320"," It ain't going nowhere. "
"20700920","20702300"," Old men are buying this right now."
"20705440","20706600"," Do you want to price target on it?"
"20709610","20710250"," Hold on."
"20710410","20710850"," Who can do it?"
"20713030","20715070"," Outside of market conditions, we can do it. "
"20720080","20722040"," Outside paying lower market conditions."
"20724500","20726220"," When do you get bullish on TDOC?"
"20726380","20726640"," You don't."
"20726780","20728240"," You just all you do in TDOC. "
"20728920","20732980"," So the one thing you want to consider here is a fair price."
"20734580","20735860"," 80 bucks sounds rational."
"20738890","20744820"," With that said, current bottom 2875, we know that right?"
"20745460","20746660"," This is your trading zone right here. "
"20748400","20749340"," We even go lower."
"20749520","20750400"," Make this your trading zone."
"20750580","20751460"," We actually make this your trading. "
"20751840","20753640"," This truly is your trading zone right here."
"20753660","20754260"," I'll be honest with you."
"20755020","20755960"," It's about a price target. "
"20756760","20759900"," I think it's reasonable to say 80 to 100 bucks over time."
"20760720","20763340"," And you're going to have some resistance here to get there."
"20763420","20764520"," It's not going to be easy getting there. "
"20765580","20771380"," That's probably going to be news based or some upper bound."
"20771480","20773740"," And then maybe next next will be 100 bucks."
"20775620","20776420"," Up here somewhere. "
"20777780","20778740"," 9575 price target."
"20780460","20791660"," With that said, with"
"20791660","20795520"," that said, there's a lot of work to do for TDOC to get there."
"20800790","20802050"," You have a gap to fill in here. "
"20802370","20806330"," What you're going to be looking for is snapping lines wherever you find support all the way up."
"20807090","20808490"," It's still in a negative channel."
"20808870","20810070"," So you can't be bullish on it. "
"20810970","20812230"," However, you can buy dips on it."
"20812230","20813210"," And I would buy this dip."
"20813350","20816050"," I don't think there's anywhere lower you need to worry about other than a bad market. "
"20817490","20818750"," Honestly, this is a big dip."
"20821130","20822850"," I think you saw it at 16."
"20823110","20823850"," You can take profit. "
"20824850","20828930"," But you'll snap lines every time here and look for consolidation to the root to the right."
"20829610","20838060"," You'll look for rejection and then a push higher."
"20838720","20840720"," Then you'll see you'll snap a line here. "
"20841800","20842920"," You'll see some of this nonsense."
"20844020","20844800"," Drop a low."
"20844920","20845680"," You'll buy that, right?"
"20846380","20848160"," You'll get more and then you'll get up, right?"
"20848380","20851480"," You'll be trading down here and then you'll start moving up something like this. "
"20852000","20856780"," Now, if you see a rejection up here, the means it needs more time."
"20856840","20861040"," You buy the dip again until you break this 2875."
"20861360","20863380"," It's not really negative or bear it. "
"20863940","20868400"," It doesn't become bearish until it doesn't, until it squeezes in here and then pushes down and"
"20868400","20868960"," that's bearish."
"20869320","20871740"," So your stop losses are not quite 2875."
"20871920","20875380"," Probably 25 is your stop loss on this ticker. "
"20875800","20877820"," And I would give it the time to trade and go higher."
"20878660","20880320"," I am going to expect it to go higher."
"20883170","20883530"," Absolutely. "
"20883730","20884190"," I like TDOT."
"20884610","20885790"," Remember he hates TDOT."
"20886470","20891490"," Watching some big, some big hedging coming in right now on the spy at IWM. "
"20892510","20896510"," Just as a heads up, there could be an impact from that briefly on the spy."
"20897470","20899790"," Some weakness in the spine of the bell due to that."
"20901980","20902700"," Not paying attention. "
"20902940","20903880"," Just be careful in this close."
"20904700","20911700"," This will probably not hold with the hedging that's going to be put on the market on these puts on"
"20911700","20912060"," the markets."
"20912400","20916360"," The spy 617-397P, $9.4 million. "
"20916880","20917420"," Not bearish."
"20917700","20918340"," Just it's a hedge."
"20919360","20921900"," It's a hedge that they'll pull off if the market goes up. "
"20922700","20927040"," But note that they will have to hedge that trade today."
"20927780","20928460"," The dealers will."
"20930300","20931800"," The close. "
"20932480","20936320"," Now, that will also translate into the after hours."
"20936660","20942110"," Also, I'm seeing some hedging coming in the market."
"20942330","20944710"," Also, that doesn't mean that it continues weekly. "
"20945030","20946650"," They were going down because of that hedging."
"20948390","20950070"," They'll pin this market with a hedge."
"20954000","20955360"," Put out a protective hedge in June. "
"20955980","20959480"," If we don't have any bad news, they'll close them out and we'll go right back up again."
"20960820","20961300"," Okay."
"20962720","20964460"," So just be careful as bell. "
"20965040","20966440"," We should have some weakness into the bell."
"20967160","20968960"," I wouldn't be surprised with weakness and tomorrow."
"20970720","20974480"," Sideways and down into the open tomorrow. "
"20976020","20978260"," Sideways and down into the open tomorrow."
"20980100","20981760"," They take this very seriously."
"20982140","20987160"," Like the church of the church of finance takes this FOMC meeting seriously, even though they make"
"20987160","20987860"," fun of J-POW. "
"20988220","20995640"," It's a moment where everyone stops in the market."
"20995640","20996820"," They're having their meeting right now."
"20997580","20999260"," They're going to give a speech tomorrow over this. "
"20999560","21004940"," That's at 2 p.m. It usually does break before then, but not before we open the market."
"21005220","21006260"," It usually won't see us."
"21006500","21009260"," You usually won't see a squeeze higher today. "
"21010540","21011820"," So pin sideways."
"21013460","21017040"," Possibly even lower than they're trying to establish 415 as a baseline."
"21017500","21020700"," I still think we can go even lower than 415 between now and tomorrow. "
"21022300","21026700"," If you want to pull porta trade, I'm waiting for tomorrow."
"21028520","21029040"," You know?"
"21029360","21033040"," I said I didn't want to trade today because where are we at the end of the day?"
"21037620","21038440"," Where are we?"
"21040080","21040720"," You know what?"
"21041040","21041240"," Floyd's garage."
"21041740","21042680"," I'm going to talk to you guys. "
"21043000","21043600"," I'm going to make a video."
"21043800","21046460"," I've done this on live stream before and why I've done it live stream."
"21046860","21048820"," So that's a falling knife. "
"21049320","21055920"," I have to give you guys a class on how to catch knives, how to identify or why you're not,"
"21056020","21062480"," don't want to catch knives, how to chart catching knives for taking long and when the cut losses on"
"21062480","21066220"," that so they can explain that better to you guys."
"21067120","21070640"," I've done it on the stream before, but if you're just joining me, I've been here before."
"21071440","21077120"," I can show you corrective moves on a ticker, when to look to long it, actually long it. "
"21077620","21085870"," How to set alerts for when to actually long a stock, but some people are long teadock, they bought"
"21085870","21086230"," the dip."
"21086690","21089230"," So I try to like that for them, but we will talk about that."
"21090390","21093210"," We have, I have to do a big video on this because it's important. "
"21093330","21096810"," It works every single time, every single time."
"21099050","21100030"," Every single time."
"21100610","21102770"," But any ticker, you can name it, call it out. "
"21102870","21103410"," It works every time."
"21104190","21108470"," Okay, so except for, except for fucking the, except for fucking biotech."
"21108610","21109550"," Fuck those guys. "
"21109970","21111150"," That's all news driven shit."
"21114270","21118370"," I feel like your common ticker is like a teadock it works on tech, speculative growth, specifically"
"21118370","21119050"," it works on."
"21121390","21123070"," So I'm going to expect that we're going to go sideways. "
"21123810","21126850"," I don't think you're getting a squeeze higher to fucking 420 in the overnight unless there's"
"21126850","21127510"," something we don't know."
"21127990","21129070"," I think we trade sideways and down."
"21129270","21129950"," You're all locked in. "
"21130230","21132030"," What did I say to you this morning on Twitter?"
"21132250","21134910"," I said, I didn't want to fucking trade today."
"21137190","21139030"," And we're right where we were this morning."
"21140690","21144830"," We're taking the day off today because there was nothing here for me. "
"21145510","21146490"," I know you guys are sick."
"21146690","21147350"," You guys are sick."
"21147370","21148650"," I was wanting to day trade everything. "
"21149990","21151370"," Well, right back where we started."
"21151570","21156650"," So if you bought along today at the open, opening bell and you held it and didn't sell it today,"
"21156650","21160270"," you're right back where you started and you lost some of your money because we haven't moved"
"21160270","21160650"," anywhere."
"21169330","21170970"," How much do you save and put in play?"
"21171190","21171830"," Yeah, we're going to do that. "
"21172030","21173210"," So the trade is coming up here."
"21173310","21176450"," Do you guys know that captain's trade is probably coming up tomorrow?"
"21177710","21183150"," If I place the trade, you will get an alert on captain's trades."
"21183590","21186850"," We'll do it here live so that we can make this trade. "
"21188250","21189590"," It's probably happening tomorrow."
"21189850","21190470"," It could be later."
"21190690","21193190"," It might not be tomorrow. "
"21193190","21196470"," If we don't get that, I need that bloodletting, a little bit more bloodletting."
"21196670","21197690"," So we'll see if we can get it."
"21198970","21205270"," The trade might be on might, I might have to pass on it until OPEC's for May. "
"21206450","21207190"," But that's fine."
"21207330","21208110"," I can wait too."
"21208330","21209990"," I only make these trades that trade. "
"21210210","21211870"," I only make nine to 12 times a year."
"21213610","21215110"," But I want to make sure it's a short thing."
"21215270","21218470"," I can't place that trade without having the FOMC news. "
"21219690","21220470"," I can't."
"21221990","21222970"," It's too important."
"21223630","21224270"," FOMC news. "
"21224810","21226630"," All the joke and smoking aside, it really is."
"21230080","21233680"," I take this trade with you and then the background, I place the trade."
"21234120","21236580"," I place the second trade for a lot of money. "
"21237780","21242090"," And I can't risk that trade."
"21242270","21243370"," I can't risk losing that money."
"21245210","21248210"," So for tomorrow, sideways and down. "
"21249310","21251030"," When do I pick this trade up tomorrow?"
"21251310","21254830"," You need to tune in so we can buy a bottom tomorrow."
"21255110","21258690"," We're going to watch the options chain tomorrow and see where everybody is in the market."
"21259390","21260310"," Who's holding what?"
"21260670","21261370"," What it's worth?"
"21262470","21267430"," And who gets fucked the most for us to then enter and take it long or short?"
"21269230","21272050"," There's a lot of money coming in right now to the market in this bell. "
"21272970","21277130"," People are buying five, four, four, twenty C's, one point one million dollars."
"21277850","21285730"," A lot of you'll buy in spy five, four, four, twenty C, ninety thousand dollars, TQQQ's, spy call"
"21285730","21288110"," five, four, you guys, you guys are savages."
"21288750","21289730"," You guys like fuck you, Cap. "
"21290770","21293890"," A lot of people out there buying calls right now on this bell."
"21295150","21299850"," So if you want to put like 10% in and buy this bell, have at it."
"21301350","21305390"," Big money rolling into spy right now on this bell right here. "
"21306170","21308250"," If you want to take the risk on it, there's a lot of money."
"21308330","21309190"," You want to follow big money?"
"21309930","21310810"," They're on it right now."
"21310890","21311590"," It just rolled in. "
"21312290","21315370"," Giant money coming into the market right now on this bell."
"21316150","21316630"," You know what?"
"21316810","21317030"," Fuck it."
"21317070","21318190"," I'll throw some zero dates in there. "
"21319590","21320730"," They're so expensive."
"21323660","21328020"," I'm going to buy some four, thirty C's for Friday or no, the fourth can I get it there to"
"21328020","21328320"," the fourth?"
"21330780","21332520"," Yeah, they're only 12 cents."
"21334260","21335460"," 12 cent calls. "
"21336600","21337500"," Man, it's so risky."
"21338780","21339740"," So risky."
"21342540","21344560"," 425 is only 50 cents. "
"21348140","21350760"," The four, twenty eights are really nice, like 23 cents."
"21350760","21352060"," Mm-mm."
"21352840","21353560"," So tempting. "
"21356830","21357810"," So tempting."
"21363910","21365570"," It was so tempting."
"21369970","21377530"," I'm telling all of you not to buy this close and I'm like, man, so four, twenty eights would be"
"21377530","21377730"," nice. "
"21384330","21386050"," Man, some of those four thirties."
"21386310","21390950"," Those are closing some real to get our shit right there."
"21391690","21392690"," Four thirty C."
"21395350","21396990"," I'm buying four thirty C's. "
"21397750","21399290"," All right, they're so cheap I have to buy."
"21399970","21401430"," I can't control myself."
"21403310","21403970"," Hell no. "
"21404930","21407390"," That's pure gambling right there."
"21411370","21413570"," Four thirty C."
"21415530","21416270"," Okay."
"21419150","21425760"," Four thirty C, thirteen cents, expiring tomorrow. "
"21432650","21433550"," Oh, shit."
"21440160","21442080"," That's some degenerate shit right there."
"21473150","21473970"," Let me get a second here. "
"21518770","21519290"," Okay."
"21524040","21524900"," Oh, shit."
"21525200","21525460"," It's okay. "
"21525680","21526340"," Lottos in the close."
"21530980","21531920"," Lottos in the close."
"21537380","21537900"," Okay. "
"21538740","21539860"," I'm in Lottos for the close."
"21541700","21542920"," I'm going to be buying one."
"21543280","21547560"," I'm buying Lottos right now for the close, but not a lot of money. "
"21550590","21551990"," Not a lot of money, okay."
"21553010","21556890"," I'm going to be buying Lottos tomorrow in the bell, depending on where we wind up."
"21557130","21567100"," And I'm probably going to be buying Lottos near the meeting, okay, at two p.m. So there"
"21567100","21567320"," we go. "
"21567580","21575440"," Lottos, savages, market internals, volume, five hundred and sixty seven million shares, ten percent"
"21575440","21577140"," above its three month average."
"21577260","21583100"," Advancement lead decline is one point seven to one, NASDAQ, volume, three point six, one billion"
"21583100","21586480"," shares, five percent below its three month average."
"21586640","21589080"," Advancement lead decline is one point three to one. "
"21590320","21591900"," Vicks, baby, down on the day."
"21592900","21595620"," Vicks bulls trapped at this point."
"21602010","21604290"," So thirteen cents into the bell. "
"21604550","21605110"," I'm not going to look."
"21605450","21606810"," I'm not going to stare at them all day long."
"21606810","21609430"," I promise I won't be awake all night long on Twitter with you. "
"21611760","21612500"," But there you go."
"21614580","21615840"," Four thirty C's."
"21616000","21617320"," Now, how long do you hold them?"
"21617600","21618320"," When do you buy them?"
"21620930","21622130"," This is so terrible. "
"21622470","21623150"," This is such a gamble."
"21623370","21626770"," I want you to know that more than likely you're going to expire worthless tomorrow."
"21627370","21627770"," Worthless. "
"21628570","21629890"," Factor that into what you're buying."
"21630010","21634790"," If you spend thirteen cents here, thirteen cents here and thirteen cents here, you're in for like"
"21634790","21636410"," thirty nine cents or something, right?"
"21636930","21637690"," Thirty nine cents."
"21638490","21643210"," Calculate how many trades you're going to place for when you start taking these trades here. "
"21644050","21645550"," Thirteen cents into the bell."
"21645730","21651090"," Four thirty C price target tomorrow on FOMC, not as hawkish as expected."
"21652550","21658810"," My call for tomorrow is that Fed Chair Powell is going to sound stern, but he is not he's going"
"21658810","21660030"," to be talking about talking about. "
"21661250","21666710"," I think point two or I think two five VPS is a possibility depending on how QT is rolled out."
"21668470","21674790"," I think 50 BPS is possible, but QT will be not as severe."
"21675550","21677870"," I think they I think they have to balance it right now. "
"21677910","21681830"," I think we get some problems in currencies in credit markets."
"21682110","21686890"," We have problems in the commercial commercial real estate markets."
"21687150","21691690"," We've got problems in the internals, the machine that runs, but the buying the scenes. "
"21692690","21698190"," I think the smart people will know that it'll come out and leak at some point and they're going to"
"21698190","21699670"," know the market can go up a little bit."
"21700410","21702850"," I am not bullish on a macro sense of this market."
"21703590","21708090"," I'm more bullish on what's going to be released tomorrow. "
"21708330","21709370"," We're down at four thousand."
"21709790","21715590"," The fucking Fed Chair is not coming out tomorrow to fucking create a market crash."
"21716070","21716710"," He ain't doing it. "
"21716830","21717810"," That's not part of his mandate."
"21718390","21720410"," That's not part of anyone's mandate."
"21720910","21721770"," Not even Volcker. "
"21722850","21725130"," All that noise about Volcker trying to crash the market."
"21725130","21727690"," He tried to have a bear market that's completely different."
"21728370","21729390"," I'm not trying to crash shit. "
"21729570","21734430"," They'll have we'll have moments where we drop huge numbers, but they're gonna get you feeling good"
"21734430","21735370"," about being down here."
"21735870","21736810"," They have to get investors."
"21737790","21740130"," They're like, hey, it's okay to be down at four thousand. "
"21740530","21742330"," Hey, it's okay to be at thirty eight hundred."
"21742650","21743810"," Hey, it's okay to be at thirties."
"21743870","21744730"," It's like holding a hand. "
"21744730","21746330"," We're going to walk you through this."
"21747470","21748550"," That's my take on it."
"21748670","21751390"," That's his job at least when we're down here. "
"21752030","21753550"," Do I think he's successful in this?"
"21753810","21754230"," I don't know."
"21754290","21754810"," You don't know."
"21755070","21755310"," Nobody knows. "
"21756590","21761990"," But do you think he's going to intentionally walk out in the room, zip down his fly and say, suck"
"21761990","21762350"," at bulls?"
"21762670","21765150"," No, he's going to say, this is the new reality."
"21766870","21769030"," We're going to probably fade sideways and down."
"21770330","21770710"," Right?"
"21770950","21771230"," Be careful. "
"21771490","21775770"," You know, he's not going to say this specific stuff, but that just is going to be times are"
"21775770","21776030"," changing."
"21776530","21777470"," Risk is out there."
"21777710","21779070"," Economy is risk is out there. "
"21779690","21781890"," And stagflation is only going to say stagflation."
"21781990","21782630"," It's going to say shortages."
"21783470","21784570"," Inflation is still a threat. "
"21785330","21786630"," I should be more more sincere in this."
"21786950","21787790"," What I'm saying here."
"21788410","21792090"," But at the same time, he's not going to come out and slam you with a hammer. "
"21792690","21797450"," As a matter of fact, there's probably going to be some talk within the meeting that will come out"
"21797450","21799630"," later when they do the minutes."
"21800130","21802970"," When the minutes come out, that's when the shit news comes out."
"21803450","21805070"," That's when you're going to hear the uglies. "
"21806030","21810990"," That's when that's when actually it comes out that they're going to say in the back room, you know,"
"21810990","21811730"," fuck those bulls."
"21811870","21813010"," We're going to take this market down."
"21813870","21815270"," And that and that will happen. "
"21815530","21819970"," The only other thing I would say in this for the counter argument, I do believe J."
"21820030","21824830"," Powell is going to sacrifice the equity's market to protect the credit market."
"21825350","21828390"," I do think he's going to sacrifice to protect the economy."
"21829490","21833610"," But I think he's going to try to do without having a market crash. "
"21834670","21835490"," It ain't going to happen."
"21836850","21845490"," There are large funds, banks that own the spy funds, 401ks, your grandparents, your parents,"
"21846230","21846710"," probably you."
"21847790","21854990"," He's not put in that position to actually do that orderly fashion all the way through and through. "
"21855890","21859630"," Short the market down, take the money away from you and redistribute it."
"21860650","21863990"," So I don't see it tomorrow."
"21864290","21864870"," I'm not seeing it. "
"21866230","21867290"," So I'm going to buy that."
"21867470","21869030"," I'm going to buy those calls under the bell."
"21869210","21870190"," I'm going to buy them again tomorrow. "
"21870750","21871850"," Probably take me twice."
"21872630","21876650"," I wouldn't I wouldn't shock me tomorrow to see this sell tomorrow."
"21878010","21881110"," I'll buy some 10 cent calls, right?"
"21881330","21884650"," It's going to slam down and then I'll have to buy them again. "
"21884650","21890450"," So, you know, if you're buying calls in this bell right now, you got to know, right?"
"21890790","21893350"," That this can fail, this can fail, and this can fail."
"21893990","21895310"," You need to understand the risk."
"21896010","21898650"," Don't come back to me and be like, hey, Kappa didn't print her. "
"21898850","21900450"," Why'd you tell me that Kappa, Kappa, you were wrong?"
"21900890","21901470"," I'm not wrong."
"21902590","21905890"," I'm measuring my risk and how many chances I'm taking here."
"21906010","21908270"," I'm saying to you, I'm trying this, this, and this. "
"21908630","21909470"," This is one play."
"21910270","21912070"," This isn't two plays, three plays."
"21912510","21916990"," This is a strategy to buy a bottom to be aware of that, okay?"
"21917630","21920570"," You don't have to hit all three. "
"21920990","21925950"," You only have to hit one of the three to print you one to three to five to six thousand"
"21925950","21926430"," percent."
"21926990","21931990"," So somewhere in here, if I can get stuff cheap enough at specific moments, I'm going to do it."
"21932090","21935290"," I'm going to take them and take them until I get one print off of these things. "
"21935290","21942050"," So right now I'm accounting for three places to buy a dip, 415, 410, and 405."
"21945730","21950510"," If we trade sideways tomorrow at a 415, I have another chance to buy it."
"21950630","21954630"," If we dip again down here at 410, I got another chance to buy it, but I'm setting myself up"
"21954630","21956770"," to win a long trade here. "
"21956930","21958350"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"21958850","21961090"," You guys understand this concept, very simple."
"21963520","21967760"," So you can't really lose as we head down here."
"21968920","21969460"," Makes sense?"
"21970160","21972860"," He'd be like, oh, cap earned all his calls in tomorrow, but that's not really true. "
"21973800","21979020"," I'm looking at spending 60 to 70 cents if it gets down here to go long."
"21980020","21982380"," This is why calls always win too."
"21983320","21983940"," Makes sense?"
"21984340","21988780"," I'm up the mic and paid one for one on puts, protective puts. "
"21989980","21992740"," And we're down here, we're in the depths of hell right now."
"21993020","21997980"," I don't get a lot of time to be buying dips, so I'm going to enjoy the trip down here."
"21998980","21999960"," I'm going to enjoy it. "
"22000440","22001220"," I'm going to buy some dips."
"22001540","22002860"," Two minutes of the closing bell."
"22003440","22011960"," Happy earnings load today, including Airbnb, AIG, Akamai, AMD, Blackout, big five sporting goods,"
"22020140","22022080"," serious logic, J-Pau from the city. "
"22022100","22022560"," Magic group."
"22022820","22024940"," Pounding gag to beat a facility with a rubberized baton."
"22025540","22030980"," Financial public storage, revolve, Starbucks, service core, sky works among many, many others. "
"22031440","22032540"," Got two minutes left to the bell."
"22032960","22034760"," J-Pau's finished eating dinner tonight."
"22037460","22041720"," Wipes his mouth with his towel, pushes his chair away. "
"22045040","22047800"," Walks slowly away from the dad room into the bedroom."
"22048880","22049480"," Who's in the bedroom?"
"22049480","22050800"," Tells I'm going to tell you, he's in the bedroom."
"22054570","22056370"," Paul say, Will sold their puts. "
"22059030","22060630"," I'm going to general, yes, I am."
"22063710","22065430"," I wasn't going to do it, but I'm doing it."
"22066170","22069790"," After seeing all those calls being bought on the bell, I wasn't expecting that. "
"22069970","22074110"," So, watching that flow on the dime in here, a bunch of call buying in here."
"22075250","22076730"," And I understand why they're doing it."
"22077330","22078070"," They're going to do it here. "
"22078410","22079510"," I don't tell exactly what's going to happen."
"22082430","22083250"," They're going to buy this."
"22083550","22084330"," They're going to buy this. "
"22086550","22088370"," And they're just going to throw money at us what they're going to do."
"22088670","22089390"," And they don't give a fuck."
"22090910","22091790"," So that's what I'm doing. "
"22092550","22093830"," That's the bank's doing right now."
"22093870","22094610"," They're just buying it all."
"22096650","22097250"," It's disgusting. "
"22098070","22103470"," The crazy part is the banks say they're not the ones the crazy part is they're going to lay flip"
"22103470","22108190"," in the S&P market on clothes to the buy side, about 300 million to the buy side."
"22108410","22109710"," 300 million to the buy side."
"22109890","22113470"," Also, one minute left, you got 15 after that to make some decisions. "
"22114550","22121410"," Also, when you've got a BRK there, right, saying that we've turned into a gambling operation,"
"22121770","22121890"," right?"
"22122630","22124790"," We've turned the market into a gambling operation."
"22125490","22126010"," What's this?"
"22127050","22130830"," Spy 54 420 C, $1.1 million."
"22131970","22132670"," Do you think?"
"22132950","22136030"," Do you think, right, that that's me placing that trade?"
"22137150","22139330"," That's like JPM placing that trade. "
"22139970","22143050"," Someone placed a million bet on zero dates for tomorrow."
"22143930","22145770"," That's not even a small office."
"22146390","22147330"," That's a big bank. "
"22148190","22151630"," That's not some guy sitting there going through a million dollars at a zero date."
"22152090","22154190"," You throw a million dollars at a zero date in here."
"22154670","22155810"," That's a bank doing that. "
"22156930","22162390"," So when the old man says, I don't like it, right, it's probably him placing that bet for someone"
"22162390","22162870"," like him."
"22163110","22164230"," You all have a great day."
"22164310","22164910"," I'll catch you all tomorrow. "
"22165130","22166890"," It's 4 p.m. Please like and subscribe these videos."

"22169470","22171010"," Please don't tip me at all. "
"22171750","22173170"," I'll try to figure out a new way to get tips."
