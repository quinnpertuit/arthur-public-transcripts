"3450","4950"," Good morning traders."
"5790","11570"," Captain Jim James here with your daily brief for August 5th, 2021."
"12370","13890"," I didn't stick around too much yesterday. "
"14330","20630"," I wound up in the morning grabbing some calls off the open, rode them up for a couple or three"
"20630","23490"," taps I think sold and then got called away."
"24150","28650"," I did post briefly about counting two to three moves on Twitter."
"28650","34750"," And maybe we'll take a look at that today if I can for a moment so that you can see"
"34750","38850"," when you should start going long or short in day trading. "
"39290","42610"," So I'll continue on on this day trading path for the rest of this week."
"42850","48530"," If you wanted to go long or short as a bull or bear, pull on."
"48530","52150"," We really didn't get that signal today either way. "
"52510","59170"," I was expecting and then yesterday's video you'll note that I was expecting yesterday to either do"
"59170","64190"," a gap up and jump up and push up or that we would accumulate for a move up."
"64650","67270"," I still hold that belief right now at this point."
"67650","71410"," We'll take a look at the charts and see what it is really showing. "
"71410","80950"," It's complicated because I use this portfolio expert software and on one"
"80950","86190"," side it's saying that the market's going to go down and on the other side it's saying that the"
"86190","87370"," market's going to go up."
"87990","94270"," So we really are still in this same rotation phase where we don't know where we're going."
"94270","96890"," So where does that leave us?"
"96890","102470"," It really does still leave us in this place where we're day trading if we want to day trade and"
"102470","107070"," you really can't claim as a bear or bull which direction we're headed. "
"107670","113390"," The only thing that would say otherwise would be where we are in the overall market."
"113390","119610"," We are at a top in a top in spy and the same thing goes for NASDAQ."
"119790","121650"," Small caps are a completely other thing. "
"122010","123510"," They're very difficult to play overall."
"124210","128490"," I kind of try to separate that index when I look at it."
"128729","134890"," So the thing to think about right now is I saw yesterday people playing off the triple tops and"
"134890","135830"," triple bottoms. "
"135830","143950"," And in reality when I got down into the charts it looked more bullish than bearish and the last"
"143950","149310"," time this played out that doesn't play out often to see those triple tops and bottoms be bullish"
"149310","151850"," but I have played them in the past."
"152390","156190"," You really have to get down inside that chart and take a look and see what's going on."
"156190","164370"," And so earlier tonight I posted to not short into strength and I think that is at least a warning"
"164370","165290"," for today. "
"165730","167350"," Now how long that lasts?"
"167970","174110"," I can't tell you from now until Friday and you know as we get closer it's going to become more"
"174110","176830"," difficult to find out which direction we move."
"176830","184130"," We do know that the easiest direction is down but we also know that the market is saying that you"
"184130","185310"," can only go so low."
"186170","193450"," So my conviction stands that we go up though I am willing to switch to a bear at any moment"
"193450","197050"," and ride this thing down. "
"197900","204070"," Especially as we headed into Friday there should be some volatility today or at least towards end"
"204070","208450"," of day you might have a little panic selling into clothes if not in Friday."
"208870","214090"," Now we do have today initial jobless claims and continuing jobless claims."
"214610","219430"," They are usually material but we already did get a purview from ADP yesterday. "
"219430","227390"," And that is important that we have that you know the market reacts to unknown news not known news."
"228030","235310"," So if the initial jobless claims and continuing claims this morning miss we already know that from"
"235310","236370"," ADP yesterday."
"236890","238710"," It's kind of like a lead up to bad news. "
"239250","245830"," Now the market truly is looking for non-farm payroll and the unemployment rate on Friday."
"245830","252930"," The unemployment rate is kind of neat as well because it takes into account people that are"
"252930","254350"," claiming unemployment."
"255730","258589"," That's built into that unemployment rate. "
"259510","264930"," If people aren't claiming unemployment it's not necessarily negative to the economy."
"265290","271150"," As far as Wall Street is concerned the more soft the economy is the stock market should go up."
"271150","275450"," And that is the oxymoron or the difficult thing for people to wrap their heads around. "
"275850","282930"," Tapering is happening in my mind from what I'm seeing in the mortgage markets and in the bond"
"282930","283390"," markets."
"283810","285250"," I think some of it is very quiet."
"286110","293790"," So I think that they are tapering to an extent but you're not going to see rates increase for the"
"293790","298930"," general public to look at as long as you see people that are employed, the people that are at risk"
"298930","302270"," of losing their homes and in the foreseeable future. "
"302910","308570"," Now the Delta variants in coronavirus those fares which just kind of makes me scratch my head."
"309010","314330"," If you're a bear you would want to downplay those risks and not upplay them."
"314630","320410"," So the more that they are upplayed the risk of coronavirus and other variants and schools starting"
"320410","323610"," in the next couple of weeks and maybe a shutdown in the government. "
"323610","328710"," I think that there's the misguidances that these are expected things."
"329870","335890"," You know when coronavirus happened I knew that we were going to drop the markets and I think a"
"335890","341810"," bunch of people did but John too public did not know that the market was going to drop and John"
"341810","345370"," too public did not know that we were going to shut down."
"345370","354550"," So when it's expected that we might have shutdowns or we might have Delta variants enforcing some"
"354550","357650"," sort of measured lockdowns coming into the fall or winter. "
"357970","360870"," It's very different than an unexpected move."
"361170","363910"," You can see that in stock price movements."
"363910","370630"," If something's expected you'll see the intrinsic extremes that we've been talking about in a couple"
"370630","370870"," of days. "
"371350","378450"," Value of options fluctuate based upon how unknown and known the news is."
"379150","387390"," So if you're expecting a great ER on a stock you will see the value of that option raise at"
"387390","393310"," a slow rate if there's interest in that stock meeting those expectations and going up leading up to"
"393310","393670"," that."
"394330","400590"," Now if there's something unexpected in that ER or something expected in that ER report and the ER"
"400590","406930"," report is different you will see you know the value of those options swing wildly until they're"
"406930","407290"," absorbed. "
"408070","413830"," So think of that like you think of the market the more that you the more that we know the"
"413830","416570"," less fluctuation there is in the market."
"416570","424310"," And so to think that the Delta variant or any other variant is going to you know send us back"
"424310","426770"," to March lows it's just not going to happen."
"427090","432070"," And then the other thing to consider is you're talking about the Fed and when you talk about the"
"432070","437150"," Fed right and that we're going to drop the market that that is possible. "
"438310","444330"," It's always there that specter is always there but you have to understand that Jerome Powell does"
"444330","447910"," not want to leave his legacy as I lost this market."
"448410","453990"," You have to understand that the players within the internals of the market know that the market is"
"453990","456790"," bad and they will keep it up as long as they possibly can."
"456790","463510"," Or even if they slow it down they're not going to be blindsided by something right now. "
"463850","470490"," Really that that chance of that happening at this moment is very low much lower than in March of"
"470490","471110"," 2020."
"471510","479090"," So moving on from the market watch up here I slacked off by showing you ES this week turn that"
"479090","479810"," off over there."
"479810","487310"," We're going to move on to ES and I slacked off in this week showing you ES in conjunction with"
"487310","490510"," spy which I should do especially for new trainers. "
"490850","498170"," They often have this mantra of futures don't matter and they do matter and they kind of put the"
"498170","498930"," puzzle together."
"499250","506870"," You'll often hear futures traders PJ traders pajama traders say that they repair what was done in"
"506870","507590"," cash market."
"507590","516350"," And it's important for you as a trader at the minimum understand futures understand the ES to"
"516350","518289"," understand where our market lies. "
"518650","526350"," Oftentimes savvy traders will buy these lows and highs in the futures market to ride them for max"
"526350","526770"," gains."
"527450","531090"," And you can kind of see how this is happening here this has been a very good week for ES"
"531090","535590"," traders it's been very consistent in its movements."
"535590","541570"," This is the chart that I really was talking about in Twitter earlier which is not shorting into"
"541570","542930"," strength. "
"543510","550490"," This chart right here normally would look very bearish to me but I have some real concern with this"
"550490","551530"," attempt here."
"552090","555390"," And specifically this third attempt down here this one not so much."
"555930","558770"," This one we should have dropped normally in a normal market. "
"559650","568110"," This response here though still weighs on my mind and then again yesterday on the fourth we didn't"
"568110","568450"," drop."
"568890","575550"," Now the prevailing thought is this is the easy way down and I don't disagree with that easy way"
"575550","576750"," down process."
"577390","584230"," But this market does you know I said we should logically move up yesterday up here and we didn't. "
"584230","590530"," And in all honesty I went back and looked to find out why we didn't go up and this fits"
"590530","591930"," in an accumulation phase."
"592270","596290"," So this still fits the narrative of us going up today."
"597390","604130"," Now how do you play this move as a bull or bear you really can't we're still in the same"
"604130","606110"," movements each day of. "
"607550","612930"," And I will look at the spy to show you where you should be bullish and bearish today as they"
"612930","613950"," do change each day."
"614690","620610"," And I do want to apologize for taking so long making this video but it is important because you can"
"620610","623570"," get burned especially in this middle area right here."
"623890","627670"," And then one last point just I know I've already said it once but I want to come back out"
"627670","629370"," real quick to that one year. "
"629370","634890"," You know this is looking bearish overall if you were to ask me talking to anyone I would say yes"
"634890","635850"," expect a correction."
"636450","640670"," Anyone would say that and that would be the plausible thing to say."
"641030","646710"," And this does look legitimately like at some point it's going to dump down into this area minimum. "
"647250","650990"," In the past though we have traded above this and the longer that we stayed in this range."
"651690","658210"," And we have had you can't deny that we've had two drops in May one in June one in July."
"658570","664490"," And then this pattern right here is starting to really shape up to give me pause on my bearish"
"664490","664770"," side. "
"664990","667990"," We'll switch over right now to the spy itself."
"668350","669790"," I think I'm on the three month chart here."
"670050","670930"," Let's get a little bit closer. "
"671230","672230"," Let's get into the one month here."
"672710","674490"," You know these are still our targets down below."
"675170","676550"," Nothing's really changed here. "
"676550","682390"," And I do expect the trading range to tighten up today even tighter than yesterday."
"682570","692150"," So we're going to put these ranges in here and I'm calling for $4.39.44 to $4.42.0."
"692670","702490"," But in reality you're definitely until we get to somewhere $4.38.68 or"
"702490","708750"," above to $4.40.33. You know I'm bullish up here and I'm bearish down here."
"709170","710870"," And this is you know simplified charts. "
"710950","712450"," This is really what you're looking for."
"712990","716650"," If we break below here today bounce up and continue down."
"717130","723970"," Your next targets you really are looking for is somewhere around $4.36.87 for a minor support. "
"724690","732510"," But we might as well go down to $4.36.08 or $4.35.34. Now if you are bearish"
"732510","734010"," in this scenario here."
"734450","737810"," This might be the fake out for a bull push up."
"738270","739630"," You know as time has passed. "
"740270","745050"," We are getting closer and closer to that to that 20 ma."
"745330","746250"," I think this is the 20."
"746590","748250"," I think this is the 50 I could be wrong. "
"748570","750310"," But you know as time passes here."
"750790","754370"," We might be having a correction without too much downside movement."
"754930","756930"," This would frustrate bearish traders. "
"757470","764030"," Or this could also be a way for the fed to get us down where we need to be without"
"764030","765170"," having a full down."
"765510","770950"," Or a full meltdown down here to $4.22 or even $4.28. I think it's now moved down to"
"770950","776190"," like $4.25 or up to let's say $4.28 or something."
"776670","778670"," You can put this on your own charts. "
"779770","784050"," At any rate let's just consider that we keep going sideways here."
"784050","785570"," We have some bad news on Friday."
"786490","788350"," And we come down and we tag here. "
"788610","791370"," And this is kind of like a move point right at this point."
"792270","794330"," And even down here is kind of a move point."
"795050","801870"," And let's say you're overly bearish even coming down to $4.21 or $4.28 or $4.29. None of"
"801870","803810"," this is really huge movement. "
"804030","811810"," We've kind of just deflected this massive move down that could set the market into an over 5 to an"
"811810","813990"," actual 5 to 10% movement."
"813990","815910"," And we're going down a crash of some kind."
"816970","818550"," So keep that in mind. "
"819090","825610"," Now, if you're bullish for tomorrow, you know, anything over $4.43, let's say we bounce up, we tap"
"825610","826850"," here and start the move up."
"827750","828690"," I would take that."
"828830","829950"," I would take that play tomorrow. "
"830510","832870"," And you would have to consider that play up tomorrow."
"833510","839450"," And I'm calling for that to $4.42. Although it would not surprise me to just bounce around one more"
"839450","839710"," day."
"840410","843970"," And we've talked about each day maybe selling off towards close. "
"844490","847430"," That is still on the table, especially heading into Friday."
"847890","851310"," If you're a part of volatility gang, we know how volatility goes."
"851850","854090"," We've volatility heading into 8.30 AM. "
"854370","861230"," And if the news is not burning the entire or scorched or, you know, some sort of scorched earth"
"861230","867690"," report, then your volatility will be gone by the time the open comes on Friday."
"867690","870830"," So if you're a volatility gang, please consider that."
"871190","873610"," And one last thing would be that same thing that I talked about earlier. "
"873610","876010"," And that's this bottom support right here."
"876450","877930"," And you'll find people."
"878350","883890"," I said I did watch one YouTube video where they're manipulating how the chart looks. "
"884690","887850"," And, you know, you can see this is I clicked this here auto."
"888290","889230"," It's just on auto."
"889570","891790"," They are making this look so dramatic in reality. "
"892010","894610"," It's not as dramatic as it would seem."
"894610","902670"," So you'd be careful of people trying to tell you or trying to swing you one way or the other."
"902890","906430"," And this pattern right here, man, I'm telling you this thing bothers me. "
"906970","909350"," If I was a bear, this pattern bothers me."
"909670","910710"," This really does."
"911050","915670"," This does spook me for a move that's unseen going up. "
"915930","917550"," We already know the move is down."
"918270","922570"," So start or at least consider the move up."
"922950","924770"," You should be like that as a trader. "
"925050","930010"," You know, when we're coming up like here, I'm always considering the move down, not the move up."
"930170","935350"," When we're over here looking like we're pointing down, you should be always looking towards the"
"935350","938410"," move up, especially if we're in bearish territory."
"939090","940650"," Let's move on to the NDX. "
"941110","942910"," We had a great day and NDX."
"942910","945470"," This worked out much better than spy yesterday."
"946130","949330"," And this tagged every port resistance that you talked about yesterday. "
"950150","951930"," Talked about 15,000."
"952170","954690"," We talked about 15,000."
"954730","955350"," I think it was 128. "
"956530","957750"," Literally kissed it."
"958170","961830"," This was the perfect play for yesterday if you were in Nasdaq."
"962310","964330"," I don't know what else to say about this to you. "
"964970","969810"," I would expect today to have some sort of a retest down here."
"969810","974530"," You probably won't get as far out as this one as this 1509."
"974890","978110"," It's called 15039 or so right in there. "
"978270","980170"," It's called that's 15035."
"982130","983090"," There's 15044."
"983570","983730"," Nope. "
"984210","986530"," I think on Twitter, I put 15039."
"986990","987830"," That's close enough."
"988570","992330"," Expect some sort of a down movement that opened and then we're going to move our way up to this"
"992330","993990"," 15146. "
"996990","998070"," 94 possible."
"998610","998930"," 46."
"999850","1000870"," A little bit more reasonable. "
"1001590","1002110"," That's 50."
"1002650","1007370"," I would expect to come down here bounce up here or remove up and come back down."
"1008190","1010150"," Anticipating Friday's report. "
"1010610","1011150"," IWM."
"1012210","1018910"," I don't know exactly what I forecasted for yesterday, but I think we're pretty much where I thought"
"1018910","1019610"," we were going to be."
"1019750","1023190"," I think I might have said possible as low as 21563. "
"1023190","1026770"," I did monitor yesterday's movement."
"1027490","1030030"," I took my focus off of spy yesterday."
"1030050","1030950"," I went and worked on both. "
"1031730","1032550"," I got this new boat."
"1032589","1033210"," What does it matter?"
"1033690","1035050"," I got this new boat yesterday."
"1035530","1042349"," I watched IWM towards the end of the day to see if it kept going down and it didn't. "
"1042430","1048930"," Actually, you can't see it here in this movement, but it did catch a bid going into closes."
"1048930","1052930"," As a matter of fact, I got this little line right here, this little trend line."
"1053290","1059510"," This trend line I put in yesterday because right here at this moment, it caught a bid in their"
"1059510","1060210"," equity buying. "
"1060890","1066050"," Although this chart doesn't show it, it caught a bid in equity buying and it definitely caught a"
"1066050","1067790"," bid in call options."
"1068670","1076710"," My anticipation is that this is going to rip towards 223 from now until I would say minimum Friday,"
"1077230","1077750"," if not Monday."
"1077750","1078630"," I think so. "
"1078810","1087550"," I think that I shouldn't say I think market participants that are bigger than you or I know more"
"1087550","1088410"," than you or I."
"1088650","1093290"," And this was one of the tells for me yesterday, someone knows more than we do."
"1093590","1101650"," And my assumption is I'm going to give this like an 80% chance that small caps rips up from"
"1101650","1104430"," now until Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week."
"1104430","1107790"," The call options that were bought were to 223. "
"1108350","1113510"," I don't know how long it takes to get there, but these guys are rolling in some fat money into"
"1113510","1114630"," this happening."
"1115130","1122670"," This could just be how the chart is playing up, but man, I'm telling you, when I see this stuff,"
"1122970","1123930"," I'm like flow charts."
"1123930","1130250"," So when I see it in the equity buying chart or equity buying charts, the software like this stuff,"
"1130270","1134770"," you know, normally, if I was just looking at this chart, I would expect to come up and then I"
"1134770","1135410"," straight down. "
"1135810","1138450"," And that is not what the internals are saying."
"1138710","1140250"," So be conscious of the idea of tomorrow."
"1140990","1145710"," Another thing too is individual stocks were still on that before we move on to Tesla. "
"1145710","1150450"," One of the neatest things we talked about earlier last or just last week or so about getting back"
"1150450","1156410"," to basics was setting up alerts on charts of where stocks can come to you."
"1156890","1161450"," Now, GME, I want to go to GME real quick or AMC, I don't care which one."
"1162010","1163990"," These are one of the ones we worked on last week. "
"1164790","1165990"," Let's type it in over here."
"1167030","1168370"," I put some alerts in this one."
"1168750","1171510"," I put them on AMD and some others as well. "
"1171950","1174170"," I'm going to scale out of this one just so you can see."
"1175490","1178390"," As AMC and I'll show you GME if you really want to see it."
"1178750","1180150"," Haven't made any changes to this. "
"1180310","1183890"," You can go back and look at the previous videos I've made."
"1184510","1186050"," And nothing's changed in this chart."
"1186250","1190590"," As a matter of fact, I got alerts here, here, and I'm assuming I'll get one here. "
"1190590","1197290"," And, you know, when you're scrambling each day to find out which stocks are hitting bottoms, they"
"1197290","1199470"," might spike up like you've seen."
"1199690","1201030"," Facebook yesterday was one of them."
"1201470","1207610"," When you start making these charts on retail favorite stocks, you will start to anticipate to know"
"1207610","1209770"," when to buy a move up. "
"1210450","1212610"," And specifically, I don't want to give you another one."
"1212730","1213890"," This is GME over here."
"1214590","1217030"," I'm kind of winging this report today. "
"1217030","1218330"," Let's look at GME."
"1218750","1223010"," I think I even spoke about GME saying, if you really like it up here, how are you going to"
"1223010","1224550"," like it down here at 137?"
"1225390","1231210"," So either AMC or GME, you know, I think people probably heard me say that in those videos and say"
"1231210","1232670"," that, you know, that's poppycock."
"1232830","1233730"," There's no way that's happening. "
"1234050","1235030"," And sure enough, it is."
"1235190","1235570"," It's happening."
"1235850","1239990"," And this is actually a very butt bearish divergence on GME. "
"1240270","1244550"," And in those videos, I told you to come back and look at these charts and see what they're telling"
"1244550","1244870"," you."
"1244870","1250290"," And, you know, if this had bounced here and come over here and we've taken one quick rip down and"
"1250290","1252270"," up, that would be very bullish to me."
"1252430","1252910"," But it isn't. "
"1253030","1255750"," This is actually trailing off horribly."
"1256510","1261950"," So I would start to add more supports going back in time for a bounce."
"1262490","1266490"," There might be a little bounce here or whatever, but, you know, if you start doing these things"
"1266490","1268390"," like Facebook is that prime example. "
"1269030","1271090"," In AMD is this prime example."
"1271230","1272950"," Amazon is another one."
"1273330","1275610"," You know, Amazon, we talked about in those previous videos. "
"1276430","1278170"," And I think I even posted a chart."
"1278970","1280210"," I think I posted this chart."
"1280770","1281750"," Let's do it in a five year. "
"1282830","1285990"," I posted this chart right here on Twitter."
"1287370","1291070"," And I got all kinds of flag for posting this chart on Twitter."
"1291270","1293790"," And sure enough, you know, we tagged that line. "
"1294410","1301350"," You can see that trend that established trend line here, here, and let's kind of a middle line with"
"1301350","1302710"," the top here by the bottoms."
"1303070","1305530"," And I spoke about how long we stayed out here."
"1305970","1307130"," I said maybe a month or so. "
"1308010","1310250"," And the shortest time frame was, I think, three days."
"1310830","1313490"," And of course, we're at three day mark and this was picked right up."
"1314010","1320130"," So in reality, when you're watching these videos that I post, you should be paying very close. "
"1320130","1324130"," I mean, this sounds so kind of sending, but these things work."
"1324530","1326170"," So these things work."
"1326930","1329750"," This isn't like shit that I make up my mind or whatever. "
"1330670","1334250"," And you can see in a smaller scale that tag right down here."
"1334450","1335830"," None of this changed none of this."
"1336270","1338290"," So you could see a buy here and a buy here. "
"1338290","1338890"," You would have won."
"1339590","1343590"," And we I taught and people were like, and I did someone did ask and I said, well, could drop"
"1343590","1347210"," another 100 or 300 points in that large scaled out chart."
"1347210","1350510"," But I did say if you're bearish, it's time to pack it in. "
"1350610","1351850"," This is not the time they bearish."
"1351990","1352950"," That's time they bearish."
"1353310","1354490"," That's time they bearish. "
"1354850","1359570"," There's nothing in this heart that says that it's bearish on a larger scale."
"1360090","1361810"," So keep following along."
"1362110","1363810"," Go back, watch those videos I've made. "
"1364230","1368830"," It is critical for you, especially if you're not telling it."
"1368830","1374390"," If you are not winning trader overall, I'm not talking like 10% or 30% in a year."
"1374770","1380770"," Talking about like 10 to 30% minimum per week, per week, if not more. "
"1380990","1387090"," And you should be hitting one to three times a year, some like 10,000 baggers like that much."
"1387590","1394790"," So if you follow along over time, you will start to make income that you won't have to work."
"1394790","1400930"," And you'll be able to pack away a retirement to an investment that you won't have to worry about"
"1400930","1401910"," what you do. "
"1402470","1404690"," I don't know how to explain this."
"1405130","1406250"," I own my cars."
"1406550","1409130"," I don't pay for cars with loans. "
"1409530","1411570"," I don't buy my houses with mortgages."
"1412110","1414210"," I just buy them outright with cash."
"1416010","1417090"," Everything I own is cash. "
"1417910","1424770"," I don't know how to explain this to you better."
"1424770","1429470"," I don't know how to explain these videos where they give you clickbait for tickers like Robin Hood"
"1429470","1431650"," or AMC or GME."
"1432530","1438230"," They're dragging you into these videos or I see videos where people don't give you a decision on"
"1438230","1439950"," where they think the market is going. "
"1440430","1445930"," It's more clickbait to get you in so that you become a consumer."
"1446410","1447630"," You're consuming their videos."
"1447630","1450890"," You're not actually becoming a non bag holder. "
"1451150","1457250"," You're not actually becoming someone that makes money day in and day out in this market or a few"
"1457250","1457950"," times a year."
"1458190","1462970"," Let's or three, four, five, seven times a year, knowing when to go in and when not to go in"
"1462970","1464070"," to trades."
"1464850","1470710"," So I think eventually I'm going to stop making these videos and just leave them up for you guys to"
"1470710","1476010"," have over time to revert back to or turn a new trader onto. "
"1476010","1481750"," Now, let's move on to a little bit of a tangent there."
"1481970","1484070"," I think I'm on a way tangent."
"1484210","1485030"," Let's go over to Tesla. "
"1485750","1489990"," If you Tesla people sapped through all this shit, I apologize."
"1491110","1498070"," Let's move over to Tesla and sure enough, Tesla did exactly what we thought it would do today."
"1498070","1501290"," We talked about hitting this, I think I said 705. "
"1502290","1506330"," Yep, 705 was what I said and I think it tagged 706 in the overnight."
"1507330","1514690"," And then I said the max to go into was 726 and it was, I don't know, 726, 27, somewhere"
"1514690","1516550"," in there on the cash chart."
"1517530","1518750"," And then it came right back down. "
"1519050","1521810"," So if you took that risky trade, congrats."
"1522010","1522910"," You must have made bank."
"1522910","1531150"," And if you are more conservative, my position still stands in that conservative play is to wait for"
"1531150","1534630"," this to come back down and buy the next run up as far as today is concerned. "
"1535150","1538650"," We're getting much too close to Friday to risk it."
"1538750","1541910"," There might actually be some sideways consolidation today."
"1542170","1547590"," You're waiting on news at this point to either drop off down here and make this move up to to"
"1547590","1550370"," 740 if things go well on Friday. "
"1550370","1552370"," I think that's all I've got for tonight."
"1552610","1554990"," Sorry to talk your ear off longer than usual."
"1555470","1557390"," I wish you all well in trading today. "
"1557790","1561930"," Of course, I will be there and open and I'll try to be back for close to unless something"
"1561930","1563010"," significant changes."
"1563190","1563670"," I'll drop that."
"1563790","1568990"," I'll drop my, I'm trying to paint or not paint, but just lack some, some wood that was a disaster"
"1568990","1569850"," yesterday. "
"1570110","1577570"," So I will try to get back on Twitter end of day if things go, go wacky and we'll definitely"
"1577570","1578990"," be there for the open this morning."
"1578990","1583410"," One last thing I just want to say to you all is that I appreciate the support."
"1583730","1585670"," I do see the views you guys are putting up. "
