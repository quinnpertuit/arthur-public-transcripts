"271680","271840"," Okay."
"272380","273680"," This is what I left you with yesterday. "
"275380","276460"," We talked about."
"278300","282840"," Talk about yesterday coming up here and squeezing out a return to the scene of the crime."
"283720","287880"," Didn't quite or as of yet still haven't quite returned to the scene of the crime. "
"288140","289640"," Have we haven't come up here yet."
"291540","297860"," There was a there was a chance here this morning for a reversal to the downside."
"298120","302180"," You can see the the bear plane right here. "
"302660","307140"," It's a five minute chart right here and a bear plane forming."
"309740","314780"," Now on the open you wanted to see a reversal on that second candle there."
"315760","320640"," And not seeing that reversal on the immediately on that open right here. "
"321680","329260"," Immediately brought up tagging the first upper pivot the second up and pivot upper pivot."
"330060","333780"," And they'll be looking for our one up here next."
"334860","340460"," So seller is not able to get it done not not to be. "
"343260","345060"," Not unexpected to go up here today."
"345220","347440"," We still have not returned to the scene of the crime."
"349220","354220"," As of today I do yesterday in stream where I was like 11 31 30 in the afternoon. "
"354220","355980"," Maybe you see that tag up there."
"356720","359420"," And then you see the actual hedge come on to the market for."
"362220","364760"," FMC and also some of these tech earnings. "
"364760","366700"," We're going to go over those this morning as well."
"366700","375200"," As we do have a quite a busy day tomorrow while we have busy."
"375420","379340"," We have busy end of day today busy open tomorrow. "
"379980","386120"," Well actually FM FMC economic calendar all were rest of the week a bunch of all."
"387900","391220"," I did see a fun strat made a comment that."
"392880","396280"," We could get a market move of 1% tomorrow. "
"399660","403500"," Now normally I would say no to that because anybody."
"405980","409240"," Normally I would say no to that because dude where did you go."
"410060","412820"," My dog looks like he took off or something. "
"414580","417560"," Normally I would say no to that because usually get a failure."
"419840","422440"," Below usually get a failure below."
"422840","426960"," What is going on with YouTube today YouTube is the disaster right now. "
"427320","429560"," I think tighter."
"435920","440780"," Usually we'll get a take all your money and run kind of a thing from."
"445390","446110"," Dealers. "
"447230","449190"," On event days."
"451170","451650"," Now."
"455320","456480"," There you go live chat. "
"456720","462240"," Okay so normally we'll get a we'll get a still your money kind of a less than 1% move"
"462240","462700"," for sure."
"464700","466960"," And this is most recently."
"468160","471300"," Less than a 1% move on a rate decision day. "
"472080","477320"," And it take all your money kind of a decision right they'll usually fail."
"479740","486200"," Price will usually fail to make the upper or lower targets briefly just just above or below."
"489860","493120"," They'll close it out and make the real move the following day. "
"495080","499440"," Unless there's a cascade or waterfall of usually puts not calls."
"501100","501700"," Now."
"503460","507320"," Funstrat saying that today he's making a valid point. "
"508040","512679"," I don't know if that was today or yesterday when he made that point but."
"514140","516500"," He's making a valid point but not because."
"517900","520940"," We'll trade out of any kind of established range. "
"522559","527900"," We have range expansion today and that will likely progress into tomorrow."
"528560","530620"," There are a ton."
"531540","533560"," Of strangle buyers. "
"535000","540500"," On this event way way not straddles way outside of the money."
"541060","542100"," Strangle buyers."
"543460","547620"," And you can actually see the expectations already. "
"548700","550000"," Expanding here."
"550700","555420"," Even today we've got an upside target of our three of four fifty eight."
"556300","562040"," Fifteen the downside target of four forty nine seventy that's a monster. "
"563120","566280"," Range expansion for one day."
"566760","572400"," Now normally we don't actually get there on the first day of range expansion but just seeing this"
"572400","572700"," here."
"572700","574300"," You're just watching. "
"575280","578820"," Of all expand even more than we normally see."
"580540","585420"," On any of these rate decision days so this is kind of fascinating to see here."
"587240","593040"," Just the amount of range expansion that's expected so if you're looking for if you're looking for"
"593040","594600"," something for tomorrow. "
"596880","599460"," There are there there's likely some really cheap."
"601480","605400"," There's likely some really cheap strangles out there."
"606060","609880"," And if I was a if I was a butterfly buyer. "
"610740","613180"," I'd be like give me the fuck out of this market for tomorrow."
"616080","620620"," I'm going to assume that a gang wants to run at some point either this open or buy end of"
"620620","621140"," day today."
"621720","625640"," If I was said again it'd be like fuck no I don't want anything to do with this because that"
"625640","626860"," is that that's pretty decent. "
"629260","630760"," Range expansion what is that."
"633940","638800"," That's pretty that's pretty decent and I expected to expand even further tomorrow."
"639600","646040"," So the fun starts saying one percent move it's actually within the expected move for tomorrow. "
"646560","648900"," And that's only the probably the first target."
"649500","656100"," So your first target is going to have a pretty big fucking move in it and one or two Sigma"
"656100","658180"," move outside of that range is even bigger."
"659040","664220"," So it's pretty fascinating to see there might be some really cheap good plays for tomorrow. "
"665220","670940"," Just want to make that note about the range expansion that's due tomorrow."
"672120","676920"," Now let's take a look before I get rid of this yellow and this red line up here we know"
"676920","683520"," where the strong sellers are the weak sellers they're right here they came right in this morning on"
"683520","687620"," on time at four fifteen a.m. They stepped right back in right."
"689020","690840"," Stepped right back in again in here. "
"692100","693800"," Stepped right back in in here."
"694640","697000"," Now we know these sellers are not strong."
"698100","702260"," We know that we can trade right up in here. "
"703560","707300"," To some kind of a failure at that four five zero six."
"709080","712280"," I made a comment yesterday on Twitter saying."
"713600","716780"," You know I'm bullish into this into today right. "
"717920","721580"," And someone was pissed off at me not pissed but made a good comment about."
"722060","725760"," Why no bearish or something like that and I was like let me rephrase it for you."
"725760","729820"," It would serve you better to look to short four fifty six. "
"732920","740280"," Into into the FMC decision and you will probably get some panic."
"740780","743000"," In tech at some point as well."
"743620","748680"," Into their earnings will look at the expected moves on the major earnings for after the bell today"
"748680","750420"," and on the open tomorrow. "
"752000","755960"," Those tickers can trade on their own regardless of what the market does too so."
"757060","760200"," We'll look at those and see what to expect."
"761360","764100"," There's also been a really nice. "
"768120","773940"," Well I wouldn't say I wouldn't say a full I'm not going to call it like a hey everybody's running"
"773940","774560"," over to."
"776480","781160"," DIA but you figure if you get a basket of money let's say you get ten dollars in your hands."
"782020","786960"," There's still some risk inside of tech you saw a nice move in tech in the overnight. "
"788000","792640"," But it's not the full full basket of ten bucks right it's probably three dollars seven dollars did"
"792640","793500"," run over to."
"794060","796280"," Matter of fact AT&T has been doing really well."
"797040","801580"," One of those nice tickers and they have a report as well coming out so we'll take a look at"
"801580","801780"," them. "
"803920","807100"," So there has been some distribution not distribution but."
"809020","811640"," Movement of money in the market even if."
"812800","817640"," Some of these reports coming great they start to sell the news on them doesn't necessarily mean"
"817640","822120"," market current or spell market crash or anything like that just movement of money around the"
"822120","822440"," market. "
"825520","827940"," So we'll take a look at the rest of today."
"827940","831180"," If I had to if it was myself I had to guess."
"831860","836020"," First of all we did not get we're above the five the twenty seven EMA and the five minute chart"
"836020","838380"," so the move is up take out all these targets to the upside. "
"838820","841840"," Take out this pre market high at four fifty five nineteen at a minimum."
"842260","845160"," We got pretty close to it I'm going to get rid of this yellow box for you right now."
"845900","850080"," As long as price stays above the six EMA the twenty seven EMA and a five minute chart we're going"
"850080","850560"," up right. "
"851660","853900"," I'll leave this yellow line up here for you."
"853940","856600"," I'm going to get rid of the red line so that you can trade the day today."
"857940","861360"," We're going to spend a lot of this morning going over these ERs. "
"863920","869140"," We'll leave this up for you so you can see it for if you want to short into tomorrow or"
"869140","869780"," find a place."
"870260","873840"," If you are looking for a strangle for tomorrow."
"874920","878080"," Sometimes it's really nice to grab it upside in the downside right. "
"878400","882360"," If we're if we're down on the day at any points you grab the other side of that strangle for"
"882360","886940"," up at any point of the day you grab the upside of that strangle to get some good pricing on"
"886940","890660"," both sides gives you a lot more leeway into tomorrow."
"891760","892960"," We'll also talk about."
"895920","902160"," Repricing today we're going to talk about at a friend last I was a friend last night was on the"
"902160","902780"," phone with me. "
"904440","910480"," And they were looking for some options that had to do with next week and not this week."
"911300","917880"," And I tried to we were discussing those there are some really cheap calls I think a week or two"
"917880","918540"," out from now."
"920760","923460"," And we were discussing those hitting in a week. "
"924220","930760"," And my point to him was if it's too close in time a week or two weeks out on such"
"930760","933820"," a busy week today or not today it's a more of a setup day."
"934240","939420"," You've got today tomorrow some some big economic news Thursday and Friday."
"940620","948120"," But specifically this rate decision you have a lot of premium built into this rate decision and you"
"948120","949820"," will get sometimes two or three. "
"950940","953680"," Repricing events inside the options chain."
"954420","963860"," That can impact your calls a week or two weeks out you can be directionally right but still not"
"963860","965660"," have as many people interested in those calls."
"965660","972120"," If right now you've got I don't know a hundred people interested in those calls. "
"973400","979660"," And then after the rate decision you only have 10 people interested in those calls even if price is"
"979660","982580"," going higher you could see a reprising event."
"983360","986340"," So right now if you're looking for calls a week or two weeks out."
"987220","990160"," Then your your directional biases are going here or there. "
"990740","996000"," I would still recommend that you take the money on the rate decision if we go higher."
"996740","1002400"," And then renegotiate that trade to your bias a week or two out from that point."
"1003480","1005640"," Too many times I've been caught in that myself. "
"1006560","1011200"," It's a very quick process happens two times usually they fail to hit the upper targets or lower"
"1011200","1011920"," targets briefly."
"1011920","1015640"," Come back then they go back down or upward whatever direction it is."
"1016400","1017160"," That's apparent. "
"1017860","1024060"," And you'll see that reprising slippage inside of your directional bias even if it's a week or two"
"1024060","1024300"," out."
"1024700","1027319"," So just be aware of that as we head into."
"1028099","1030020"," That's a ball crush okay. "
"1031079","1032819"," Ivy crush ball crush."
"1033480","1037800"," Interest in what everybody else is interested in so you're getting wrapped up in an event."
"1038560","1042980"," Or you're interested in something else a week let's say a week down the road or five days down the"
"1042980","1043220"," road. "
"1043980","1049380"," And you're getting caught caught up into this event that's taking place."
"1050060","1054580"," You know just a few days before what you're you're targeting so just be aware of that."
"1056200","1059380"," If you're looking for those trades farther along down the road. "
"1063320","1063960"," Good morning."
"1064060","1064480"," How are you all doing?"
"1064580","1065360"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"1065500","1066580"," Let me drink a little sip of coffee here."
"1068540","1072820"," I'd like to take one more trade to the upside these fucking bears can't put it together man. "
"1073120","1077440"," They had it right here you can see it right here they had a chance here."
"1078540","1082280"," Right there they had a chance squeezed up second bar man."
"1083040","1087680"," I was like can they can they reverse it to the downside can they get like one or two rejections. "
"1088100","1091740"," That's all they needed like two of these and they couldn't get it done."
"1092640","1098840"," This would have been your entry to short and it just kept fucking banging it bang bang."
"1100300","1101760"," Like nobody's business. "
"1108090","1109630"," My knees looking better today."
"1110050","1113610"," If any of you out there that sent you a picture yesterday of my knee."
"1114390","1115710"," It's looking better today. "
"1117530","1119390"," The infection has come down."
"1119930","1122570"," I banged up my knee over the weekend on Friday."
"1122570","1126110"," And was it Friday or Thursday or something. "
"1126530","1129830"," I was thinking it was Thursday afternoon and it wasn't looking good yesterday."
"1130670","1134970"," As I said some of my disgusting I didn't send feet pics yesterday I sent knee pics."
"1137290","1138770"," But this morning it looks great. "
"1139390","1141870"," I had to do some some irrigation on it."
"1146540","1147840"," Hang tight one second there."
"1161960","1163500"," My youngest just came in. "
"1163500","1168200"," She looks like she just rolled off the right the wrong side of the bed this morning."
"1168300","1169200"," She looks like Barbie."
"1171120","1173500"," Looks like Barbie that it hasn't had a hair brush. "
"1180100","1180540"," Okay."
"1183000","1187500"," Man I want to buy that one right there so bad but I can't I know these sellers are right"
"1187500","1187660"," here."
"1187760","1192320"," It's almost the same setup as yesterday right grind grind grind grind grind grind. "
"1199600","1201060"," Yeah good morning everybody how y'all doing."

"1316460","1321040"," I've heard mixed things on on Reddit of all."
"1321360","1321720"," Just here."
"1322080","1322560"," What am I looking for?"
"1328120","1331400"," Which folder are we getting that from left images. "
"1332340","1332960"," Better."
"1342890","1343570"," Just a second here."
"1347050","1348510"," It's like that's the one. "
"1355500","1356620"," Then let's see."
"1357860","1359320"," We're going to make some changes."
"1360640","1361780"," Or not some changes. "
"1362080","1364800"," Unless if any of you guys in the chat know better."
"1368500","1372420"," Yeah, there's a there's a part to this where."
"1374100","1378980"," I can and I can't stream to can't simulcast. "
"1379520","1382160"," To YouTube under the same camera."
"1383000","1384060"," There are tech."
"1384260","1385700"," Well, there's two things one. "
"1387520","1389120"," People do simulcast."
"1389480","1390840"," I've been told that they do."
"1392500","1396780"," And I think it depends upon who you are. "
"1397980","1403980"," The second thing that I've seen is simulcasting with a second camera set up."
"1406380","1409340"," People will simulcast, but it's not the exact same stream."
"1409340","1417460"," So you'd see like a different camera angle of me showing on YouTube and a different camera angle of"
"1417460","1418340"," me showing on Twitch. "
"1419580","1422420"," So I think I'm going to I'm going to apply and see what they say."
"1422840","1424200"," See what they say about this."
"1424640","1434300"," Now they also said there was also some discussion about gamers versus people that do niche niche"
"1434300","1435440"," stuff like myself. "
"1436180","1438180"," We do stocks and bonds on Twitch, right?"
"1438620","1441760"," It's a niche niche kind of a thing."
"1441780","1443180"," So there's a little bit of a difference."
"1443560","1446940"," I guess a little bit of different requirements. "
"1448380","1452600"," And some of this stuff I guess has to do with what exactly you're streaming to."
"1453000","1457300"," And I don't know all the details on this, but let me know in the chat what your thoughts are"
"1457300","1457560"," on this."
"1458020","1460220"," I like the idea of being just an affiliate. "
"1461460","1463840"," I like it for the freedom, mostly."
"1464460","1465420"," I can do whatever I want."
"1465520","1466500"," I can stream whatever I want. "
"1466660","1471020"," I'm not signing anything that's like put me into getting me locked in."
"1472820","1474320"," It's any kind of requirements."
"1475180","1477520"," There's some this weird to as an affiliate. "
"1477520","1479100"," I guess I get better traction."
"1479100","1483580"," Some people have said some people reported that when they've become a partner in Twitch."
"1485000","1487920"," That's it like their growth just ends right there. "
"1489000","1490320"," No, I don't know how true."
"1490460","1494460"," I don't know how true some of these reports are that I've read on Twitch or not."
"1494660","1496000"," So if you're if you're familiar with Twitch. "
"1497100","1500940"," And you want to let me know what your thoughts are on becoming a partner or not."
"1500940","1502140"," If you think it's worth it or not."
"1502520","1503840"," And I was thinking about coming to partner. "
"1503960","1510000"," So if I show up to this Twitch con, if I can partner and maybe that is better for me"
"1510000","1510940"," to be a partner."
"1511280","1511640"," I don't know."
"1523360","1525320"," So let me know inside Twitch what you think. "
"1528320","1528920"," Wait a minute."
"1528980","1533280"," Someone just said a three-finger put bear class forming in one minute, five minute, one H.T. just"
"1533280","1533800"," for open."
"1534300","1535460"," We'll take some time to confirm. "
"1536260","1538080"," Missed the start of the show was this addressed."
"1538600","1544140"," You should you should definitely turn this show back to the start time and watch the show from the"
"1544140","1544440"," beginning."
"1545720","1547980"," If you want that addressed quote unquote. "
"1551300","1552100"," So there you go."
"1552260","1554900"," You've got a we've got the Twitch stuff."
"1555060","1559520"," If anybody's a Twitch follower or a Twitch streamer has an experience working with Twitch"
"1559520","1560020"," streamers. "
"1560040","1563780"," See what they have to say and let me know inside the chat because I have no idea what I"
"1563780","1564340"," should do with that."
"1569600","1571000"," What was the other thing big balls?"
"1571420","1572880"," I don't know what you're talking about about YouTube."
"1575120","1576520"," You said which one did that. "
"1578180","1580040"," You still cut cost."
"1580140","1581040"," Yeah, I think I can still cost."
"1581200","1582700"," I don't think it's an issue costing at all. "
"1586750","1587510"," Wait a minute."
"1587690","1588250"," What's going on?"
"1588350","1588930"," Twitch is out."
"1589110","1590050"," Maybe check Twitch right now. "
"1590610","1590910"," Sorry."
"1591110","1591690"," It wasn't on Twitch."
"1592110","1594490"," Somebody somebody hitting the buttons on Twitch right now. "
"1595350","1596170"," Pink tie, guys."
"1596530","1597530"," I'm getting on Twitch right now."
"1598870","1601670"," I'm just I'm reading the multi stream chat. "
"1602690","1603390"," Uh oh."
"1604010","1604910"," Shield mode is on."
"1605590","1606910"," Who's messing around inside the chat?"
"1607790","1609410"," Is that you bear town sheriff?"
"1613630","1615530"," Ten minute followers mode. "
"1616530","1617450"," Slow mode."
"1619290","1619950"," Let's go."
"1620070","1621410"," Who's in here tapping on the buttons?"
"1622710","1624630"," Let me see. "
"1625130","1626270"," What's going on here?"
"1628890","1630610"," Me one quick second here."
"1630830","1632150"," I got to check with Winky."
"1632150","1636290"," I don't know what 10 minutes slow mode is. "
"1638310","1639690"," Up rising against the mods."
"1644270","1645190"," Hello, you guys."
"1645970","1651820"," Oh, and I found out who the guy. "
"1656390","1658010"," I'll have perks at Twitch gone."
"1659070","1660270"," He won't have as a."
"1670890","1673090"," Yeah, no, no, we didn't hit these buttons."
"1673090","1674430"," I think someone hit it by accident. "
"1675970","1676750"," Relax, everybody."
"1676770","1677150"," I'm going to get you."
"1677250","1678130"," I'm going to fix this right now. "
"1678290","1678410"," Hold on."
"1681830","1685510"," I think I think a moderator was messing around or by accident this morning."
"1685510","1686090"," So hang tight. "
"1694480","1695960"," Oh, to turn off."
"1698560","1699820"," Ten minutes slow mode."
"1706690","1708010"," And ten minute followers. "
"1710610","1711690"," Ten minute followers."
"1714350","1719720"," There we go."
"1719780","1722200"," Let's see if I can get some help here with this. "
"1726170","1727790"," Yeah, the ten minute follower mode."
"1727890","1728710"," You can turn that off."
"1729030","1730590"," I don't exactly know how to turn that off. "
"1730650","1731770"," And I don't know how to turn off the."
"1736170","1737390"," You can turn that."
"1737730","1738290"," It's the patriarchy. "
"1739530","1740130"," Hold on."
"1740250","1740690"," Channel points."
"1740850","1742350"," Let me see how to turn this stuff off. "
"1743350","1743850"," Turn on."
"1744150","1745150"," That highlight settings."
"1745690","1746150"," Chat settings. "
"1746570","1748650"," Oh, here we go."
"1749250","1750470"," Show mod icons."
"1751250","1751570"," Show moderation. "
"1752350","1752650"," Shot."
"1752810","1753290"," Show mod actions."
"1753810","1754130"," Show masters. "
"1754410","1754510"," Cop."
"1754670","1756890"," Let me see here."
"1761800","1763080"," Shield mode is off, finally. "
"1763920","1764360"," We're only chat."
"1764760","1765000"," That's cool."
"1765940","1766380"," Followers. "
"1766480","1766840"," Only chat."
"1767280","1767560"," Zero minutes."
"1769060","1769960"," Only followers. "
"1770220","1770580"," There you go."
"1772600","1774180"," And pause chat."
"1774540","1775040"," Scroll only. "
"1775280","1776200"," Brief deleted message."
"1776520","1776720"," Okay."
"1776740","1778180"," So I think I got the set right now. "
"1778780","1786180"," So if you're a moderator in Twitch, there is a cog wheel in the bottom by where send messages."
"1787360","1789660"," You guys might be hitting that chat settings."
"1792920","1795960"," So chat might be okay right now. "
"1797520","1798320"," Twitch again."
"1799440","1803140"," I'm reading what you guys are saying inside the chat of Twitch right now."
"1803780","1807820"," You guys are pretty much where I'm at with being a."
"1809800","1811120"," You guys are pretty much. "
"1811440","1812380"," Did I fuck this up?"
"1816940","1818740"," Can somebody make a comment in Twitch?"
"1821280","1822200"," All right."
"1822380","1822420"," Cool."
"1822560","1822660"," Cool. "
"1823120","1823340"," All right."
"1823400","1823440"," Good."
"1825100","1830420"," Thanks for the comments in Twitch. "
"1830940","1831120"," Yeah."
"1831340","1833800"," Most of what you guys have said about being a partner I agree with."
"1834360","1838580"," There's like all these, these cost benefits like dude, you know, like having YouTube. "
"1839400","1844940"," We're about to have nighttime videos and a bunch of shorts come out on YouTube."
"1846020","1850240"," The shorts on YouTube are like the, like the end of the day where I give you the expectations for"
"1850240","1850500"," tomorrow."
"1851060","1855580"," And then just highlights wins and losses like when I get smoked or when I win. "
"1856400","1859360"," For like shorts and then a nighttime video to be recorded."
"1859360","1862820"," Those three things are going to be great for YouTube."
"1863880","1867520"," And they kind of way being a partner with Twitch right now. "
"1867860","1873760"," The only thing I think I think about would be maybe become a YouTube partner or a Twitch partner."
"1874080","1879880"," Show up to that Twitch con to do a meet and greets and then make a decision there and say"
"1879880","1883440"," I don't want to be a partner anymore or I'll stay being a partner with Twitch."
"1883440","1889520"," I don't mind doing another camera set up either for YouTube to technically get around the, the, the"
"1889520","1892520"," evade or not evade but have two different streams going on once. "
"1892680","1893980"," I'm kind of open to that as well."
"1894560","1895600"," I've got extra microphones."
"1895900","1901060"," They're going to have two separate mics, two separate cameras and do two, two separate streams,"
"1901060","1905340"," which would technically be still, which would not be simulcasting. "
"1905460","1908620"," It's two, two unique streams just at the same time."
"1912000","1913440"," Yeah, that's a good question too."
"1913580","1915500"," I don't know if there's a mechanism or not. "
"1917300","1919660"," There is no reversal on spy right now."
"1920060","1923140"," You've got still price just checking here."
"1923680","1925700"," The five minute trigger and a five minute chart. "
"1926440","1930200"," It looks like we're selling into supply above here."
"1930320","1932680"," You just again, just as we started the show."
"1933480","1934420"," Hold on a second here. "
"1935220","1940920"," So as we started the show, someone asked a question about the tweet that made about a bear, three"
"1940920","1942460"," trigger bear cluster, right?"
"1943080","1945760"," We showed you what the bears needed to do off the bell."
"1946220","1948020"," And we also stated it was developing."
"1949180","1952720"," So what you need here is you've got the hourly trigger right here, right?"
"1953360","1955840"," There's the HT right there. "
"1956460","1959400"," You've got the initial open, right?"
"1959700","1962160"," The squeeze hired to tag some of these upper targets."
"1962680","1963720"," We've cleared out."
"1966720","1973220"," We've cleared out this price this morning at 4.15, this pivot point, right?"
"1973660","1974180"," Basically we have. "
"1974400","1977320"," I guess technically we haven't, but it's still pretty close right there."
"1978580","1980700"," Have the tag there and the tag right there."
"1981760","1986920"," If you're a bear and you want to get short here, well, you need to see. "
"1987300","1992760"," And here's the bear plain forming before the open right here, right?"
"1994520","1999620"," So what you're looking for is for price to get underneath the hourly trigger."
"2000360","2003460"," And for this kind of reversal right here."
"2005460","2008320"," We're going to take that big trade to the downside. "
"2009060","2014180"," Now as we had stated this morning and yesterday, you're still looking for."
"2015860","2018020"," This is the chart from yesterday, right?"
"2018960","2020720"," Came down here, bounced around, came back up."
"2021530","2023440"," That today is the kind of day. "
"2023780","2029940"," We've posted this on Twitter yesterday where if you wanted to short, you want to short for 4.56 up"
"2029940","2030820"," here at some point."
"2031580","2034260"," You're going to grab some liquidity to the upside, right?"
"2034580","2038700"," For this pin and hedge into tomorrow, right?"
"2038800","2042100"," We talked about a hedge coming out of the market."
"2042780","2049380"," 11.30, 1.30 down into here to get this pin into the market for the expectation of a larger"
"2049380","2053940"," move on a larger move on FOMC. "
"2054440","2059239"," We also addressed this morning the range expansion in the market, right?"
"2059400","2064120"," We talked about a much greater range expansion even into today."
"2064600","2065739"," You can see it here."
"2066080","2070639"," Normally you don't get these moves the first day of range expansion, but that range expansion even"
"2070639","2072139"," continues into tomorrow. "
"2073100","2082420"," Most of these rate decisions, you don't see moves greater than about 0.5%, 0.05%. And so we're"
"2082420","2089739"," already having expectation tomorrow just by the options market of a greater move tomorrow, which is"
"2089739","2092820"," within where bets are being placed."
"2093040","2096560"," Bets are being placed wide strangles on this market right now."
"2110890","2112070"," We got going on here. "
"2116090","2121190"," If you're a finance specific channel, I don't see a huge reason for being a partner in Twitch, to"
"2121190","2123130"," be honest, if Twitch was bigger for finance, sure."
"2123770","2125270"," Yeah, that's what I was thinking, Yeti."
"2125530","2129990"," Yeti, a lot of these, there are people on Twitch that stream all kinds of shit. "
"2130770","2136690"," Like there's like knitting channels and there's a bunch of niche communities or niche communities."
"2137850","2141130"," And a lot of those people are like, partnership doesn't benefit me."
"2141670","2143930"," If you're a gamer, it does benefit you. "
"2145390","2151990"," But as a finance streamer, like a stocks and bonds streamer, I don't even know how to approach some"
"2151990","2159390"," of these people at TwitchCon because they're talking about meeting someone that's a liaison between"
"2159390","2168110"," you and a sponsor and probably have to talk to them about sponsors that are interested in stocks"
"2168110","2168650"," and bonds."
"2168810","2173630"," Which is kind of crazy too because of how I've had this thing."
"2173910","2178330"," I'm never going to want to be sponsored by anybody that don't like or trust. "
"2178950","2185710"," Like I love and trust BookMap and I've actually spoken to them in the past, but I don't, do these"
"2185710","2186950"," people know who BookMap is?"
"2186950","2192130"," They know who some of these companies are that I actually like and trust."
"2192650","2197830"," So I don't even know if that's going to be beneficial in the background either."
"2198090","2198650"," You got him saying. "
"2198790","2200750"," I think Yeti knows what's up."
"2206500","2207920"," You can help with a gamer."
"2208200","2211100"," You hit me up on a DM man, Legacy 10. "
"2212260","2213720"," Because I have no idea what I'm doing."
"2214020","2216160"," I have zero ideas what I'm doing here."
"2218520","2223640"," Okay, so we've got a successful retest right now forming on the five minute chart. "
"2223740","2225040"," Let's get the one minute chart really quick."
"2225600","2227280"," Still no confirmation here."
"2227840","2229340"," I'd like to see price get above. "
"2229440","2230680"," There's a one minute spy chart."
"2231320","2233660"," I'd like to see price get above this one minute right here."
"2235100","2237460"," Something like this failure right here. "
"2238300","2240700"," Come back down right here and then look for a long."
"2242000","2245340"," So we'll see how this plays out or if this is a trap for the bulls."
"2246540","2249540"," Something like that and actually tagged that four fifty five eighteen. "
"2250120","2250940"," Take a trade."
"2251240","2254840"," If any of you are asking about trades right now inside the chat."
"2255080","2256420"," I was in discord this morning. "
"2256720","2260820"," We said it would green bar up off of the bell this morning."
"2261080","2265880"," So if you're if you're saying, are we taking a trade or anything like that?"
"2266080","2267140"," You should get inside the discord."
"2268960","2271540"," Anyone anyone out there that's like, are we taking a trade?"
"2271540","2272560"," Are you that kind of stuff?"
"2273800","2275560"," You can get right inside the discord. "
"2275720","2276840"," I'll give you a link to it."
"2279700","2280580"," The discord."
"2281200","2282720"," You've got traders in there. "
"2282880","2283640"," I eat myself included."
"2285000","2287980"," And now we do trade trades inside of that discord."
"2289440","2292480"," So if you're looking for trades and you're like, why are we taking any trades?"
"2292740","2293280"," Anything like that?"
"2293660","2295340"," We were taking trades right at nine fucking thirty. "
"2297000","2299340"," So you get right inside the discord."
"2299340","2302200"," You can go to my two favorite rooms in there for traders."
"2302860","2306920"," Is definitely the trading floor and futures. "
"2307280","2307600"," Globex."
"2308400","2310600"," So if you're ever like, why aren't we taking trades?"
"2310900","2314920"," I was with them this morning before the opening bell to briefly nine twenty five."
"2314920","2317340"," I think until nine forty five or something. "
"2318380","2321420"," So if you guys are ever looking to see where I am or what I'm doing."
"2322420","2323880"," The stream's not exactly up yet."
"2323880","2328580"," Let's see that trade forming right now. "
"2335520","2338280"," Yeah, I took a I took one trade off the bell."
"2338540","2340020"," I made good money off that one."
"2340040","2344020"," Then I took a second trade that I got out too early on. "
"2344020","2346600"," I took a took one quick trade right here."
"2347300","2349880"," And then I took another quick trade right here."
"2350000","2351180"," I didn't take this one. "
"2351600","2353980"," This one right here only paid me like three fucking pennies."
"2354160","2355280"," I was a little stinky about it."
"2362240","2363860"," That's still a winning day at this point. "
"2363980","2364720"," It's still a winning day."
"2364920","2369660"," So I'm actually having a losing trade yet today."
"2369780","2371980"," So I'm waiting for this one right here to see if it'll. "
"2373720","2375380"," Give me a quick scalp to the upside."
"2378740","2383780"," Yeah, I mean, crispy piezade is like."
"2384280","2385460"," We made trades. "
"2385700","2389980"," Some of you guys in there made trades all the way up to here and right here."
"2390440","2392880"," So I guess be done for the day."
"2393100","2394380"," Like this was enough right here. "
"2395780","2397620"," You can see the green bar on the open."
"2398260","2399440"," It's fairly easy to see."
"2400300","2405820"," Even with the bear, even with the bear, even with the bear cluster forming, you knew it was going"
"2405820","2407660"," to green bar up and at least check this. "
"2408440","2410000"," You knew that no matter what."
"2411020","2412920"," It's not a five minute chart right here."
"2413980","2419660"," You knew you knew even on the chart that I posted on Twitter, no matter what you're going up here. "
"2420220","2422560"," You knew you were going right there."
"2422620","2428440"," Gary fucking teed because you got to get the confirmation and cash market off of the 20, 70 and a"
"2428440","2429300"," five minute chart."
"2432860","2437720"," So any of you that were in discord this morning knew that no matter what we were going to go"
"2437720","2438860"," up there and fuck with that thing. "
"2444560","2445860"," Small range today."
"2446180","2448460"," I'll be honest."
"2449160","2453740"," It's the same as I said this morning and yesterday like you're going to look for positioning today. "
"2454360","2456800"," The greater move is not here."
"2457520","2460460"," It's what takes place tomorrow, Thursday and Friday."
"2461400","2463040"," There are two thesis's on this. "
"2464520","2466440"," Even even fun strat this morning."
"2466900","2475860"," So yesterday I gave you the expectations and then the small chance moves."
"2476240","2477940"," I talked to you about the bear thesis. "
"2478720","2480120"," How far down can we go?"
"2481260","2482500"," I showed you what that was."
"2482840","2483540"," It was pretty low."
"2483800","2484180"," I think it was. "
"2484420","2485360"," Let's take a look at it right now."
"2485360","2490900"," I gave you the bear thesis for tomorrow."
"2493360","2498780"," And the downside move for bears tomorrow is fucking pretty low right way down here. "
"2500800","2503380"," 446 will be the target for bears tomorrow."
"2503600","2507320"," It's a pretty big move way outside of this range expansion right."
"2508000","2512680"," And you're likely going to get range expansion tomorrow way down there. "
"2512680","2513760"," The downside."
"2515380","2519620"," Pretty big moves right for for spy might be worth taking."
"2520460","2524740"," Calls and puts down there and way up to the upside. "
"2525740","2529480"," Now when I would I talk to you yesterday about that range expansion."
"2531260","2532800"," I don't think that 460."
"2534020","2537480"," That doesn't look like a 1% move to me. "
"2538580","2543420"," So you're talking about maybe even slamming up to that 463 number."
"2546400","2547980"," 465 somewhere up in here."
"2548240","2549860"," Well I'll get to the exacts today. "
"2550600","2553000"," Whatever the options market is saying by end of the day."
"2553740","2556900"," So that would be the other the other side of that move would be somewhere like that."
"2557300","2560480"," It's a pretty significant move for spoos. "
"2560480","2567560"," There are a lot of traders taking the up and down side bet tomorrow."
"2570280","2573520"," On spoos I think it's got to be right here though I think it's that 460."
"2574300","2577560"," I'd be looking for something like something like in here. "
"2578660","2580880"," Right in there right in there for that move."
"2582480","2586780"," So if they just fail to get that move just fail to get that move."
"2587400","2589940"," You're just right inside the money there. "
"2591100","2592440"," For that move tomorrow."
"2592920","2597380"," Now the discussion we had yesterday about the low probability of going there."
"2598620","2600040"," Fun sure I was saying no. "
"2601120","2604880"," Due to the options market we can't I don't he didn't say due to the options market but."
"2607760","2612680"," He did well he said we have the potential reason he's saying that is because of the options market."
"2612680","2613680"," Now. "
"2615040","2620740"," I gave you the other side for the bowl thesis to go up and you know do they front run."
"2621380","2624520"," Looking in the rear view mirror and I think front strat was at least."
"2625880","2627060"," Hinting towards that. "
"2628100","2631440"," That you get a rear view mirror trade."
"2632540","2634560"," Tomorrow and I also questioned."
"2636320","2640120"," Does that get front run before we get into tomorrow. "
"2640120","2643080"," There is a like a 5% chance."
"2643920","2648320"," That we don't even go down there and get pinned even if the market gets hedged."
"2648860","2652520"," They could get overrun before you ever even get there tomorrow. "
"2653840","2654760"," Like a panic."
"2655060","2657280"," I don't know if I was a hedge fund if I would be short."
"2658520","2661400"," All the way to until 2 p.m. tomorrow. "
"2661560","2663600"," Maybe short until 11 a.m. tomorrow."
"2665360","2670760"," The dude like you know like to think about that you probably at some point have to take that hedge"
"2670760","2671120"," off."
"2672380","2676560"," Like not even worth trading or I guess you stay short. "
"2677100","2683020"," And I mean under under normal circumstances like a point 0 5% move."
"2683740","2688200"," If there's an expectation that we move let's say tomorrow we had an expectation of."
"2688780","2691060"," Trading to this here or this here. "
"2691800","2697120"," You know even if you had the market hedged and we went up there and then failed."
"2698000","2701460"," You could buy the market leave your heads on and we'd eventually come back down."
"2701920","2702780"," No big deal. "
"2703860","2707780"," But for tomorrow there is actual risk for."
"2709200","2713500"," For funds that you could see that move higher and we don't come back."
"2714260","2716660"," You could see that obscene move to the upside. "
"2717620","2721240"," And fuck you we're up at 460 and we're not coming back down for a little while."
"2723860","2727440"," So there is some tail risk to south side funds tomorrow."
"2727960","2729480"," Now whether that plays that or not. "
"2729540","2730340"," I don't know."
"2730340","2731960"," I'm not a hedge fund."
"2732120","2734980"," I don't know the kind of risk they're willing to put on. "
"2735120","2736240"," They'll tell you all kinds of shit."
"2736380","2738820"," They're going to tell you stuff like you know if it goes up."
"2738960","2740660"," We're going to buy the underlying. "
"2741000","2741460"," We don't care."
"2742800","2745360"," You find hedge funds blow up when they do that shit."
"2745620","2747460"," You find out they actually didn't buy the underlying. "
"2748180","2750680"," You know they just fucking they're fucking short."
"2752320","2755260"," Every year or two you get every year or two right."
"2755780","2759160"," Sure enough not just hedge funds but you'll find like. "
"2760440","2766040"," I'm not going to name names but I've seen like email and text links and people sound like they're"
"2766040","2767280"," highly intelligent."
"2768800","2774300"," Publicly and then you get the email and text message leak and they were like long zero date puts"
"2774300","2776200"," fucking 50 deltas."
"2776380","2780720"," You know shit like that for size and you're like oh it was those fucking guys. "
"2781060","2782400"," It wasn't fucking retailers."
"2782800","2784380"," It was a fucking professional."
"2784780","2787020"," You know. "
"2789760","2794850"," So we're going to look at a bunch of tickers today."
"2796710","2801190"," As this plays out I'm going to leave it on the one minute chart here for you."
"2803670","2806170"," So we'll see if we can confirm the upside move. "
"2807110","2813410"," If you want a little bit of a setup here in case it happens you'll see it right here."
"2817840","2822160"," I'm going to set this up for you if you're looking for a day trade right here."
"2825300","2826920"," Just like yesterday for you. "
"2827180","2828100"," There's another one right here."
"2830220","2830720"," Okay."
"2831460","2836960"," And what you're going to be looking for is reversal to the upside here. "
"2837120","2841120"," You're going to look for a tag above here."
"2841440","2841660"," Failure."
"2842660","2843160"," Right. "
"2844400","2845520"," And then this move right here."
"2846800","2847300"," Failure."
"2847700","2848600"," And then this one right here. "
"2848600","2848840"," Okay."
"2850400","2851720"," So we'll see if this happens."
"2852100","2857140"," I personally would not take this trade unless we trade this first. "
"2858500","2860060"," And then confirm right there."
"2860380","2862620"," So I would buy calls like right here somewhere."
"2862920","2863040"," Okay. "
"2864460","2868520"," I know you guys like putting more risk on but I want to see that developments that move to the"
"2868520","2868660"," upside."
"2870440","2873080"," So leave that on right now in a one minute chart for you."
"2874100","2875380"," Just so you can see it. "
"2877580","2882580"," And we'll put a little drawn in here for you making nice and easy for you."
"2887540","2889320"," So if you're looking for it."
"2889800","2893300"," I want you to know that there's a lot of sell side right here. "
"2894460","2894520"," Right."
"2894800","2895560"," Watch my cursor right."
"2895680","2896500"," There's a lot of sell side. "
"2896620","2898000"," They're going to want to reverse this on you."
"2898580","2902180"," Try to reverse this in here and send it right back down on you stuff like that."
"2905380","2907160"," So I'm going to leave that up for you right now. "
"2907380","2909560"," So if you're looking to put some risk out in this market."
"2910060","2911140"," Not financial advice."
"2912140","2914260"," You should not be following the untrades. "
"2914540","2917380"," I think it says that somewhere down below there."
"2919300","2922320"," But you guys like where are the trades at?"
"2922620","2923140"," I'm like man."
"2924400","2926100"," See this supply down here. "
"2927800","2929240"," See that supply down there."
"2931980","2935200"," And we limit chats members on YouTube and subscribers on Twitch."
"2938460","2939340"," See here. "
"2943500","2944660"," Just a second."
"2946400","2949020"," Any kind of failure of this white line right."
"2949380","2950160"," You know how this term. "
"2950440","2952520"," You know how this moves or changes direction."
"2953400","2955980"," You know if you get a liquidation breakdown here."
"2956620","2960500"," You know there's usually another chance to get out of your calls in here right. "
"2960500","2961160"," You don't ever."
"2961560","2964480"," You don't ever like sell that first bar down."
"2964780","2967900"," You wait for it to suck back and suck itself back up. "
"2968400","2970920"," Before it gets drowned to the downside right."
"2972400","2973980"," It has that a managed positions."
"2975960","2978000"," So watch this how this plays out here. "
"2978640","2981920"," And see if we can get the move to the upside."
"2982300","2983480"," Try to buy that on the way up."
"2983480","2987760"," And while I do that with you. "
"2988320","2990360"," We're going to start setting up trades."
"2991420","2994460"," And start looking for the expected moves."
"2995020","2997200"," Or tomorrow and the FOMC. "
"2997780","3000020"," We're going to look at this morning."
"3000300","3003140"," All of the tickers that are going to report."
"3003680","3004620"," End of day. "
"3005540","3008520"," I think you're going to be surprised that may take on some of these tickers because."
"3009160","3011120"," I think there's a really nice."
"3012920","3014600"," I think there's a really nice. "
"3016980","3019760"," Some really nice setups for some of these tickers into tomorrow."
"3020120","3023040"," They're going to be they're going to be surprised that may take on them."
"3025700","3028720"," So we're going to look at we're going to look at some of those tickers today. "
"3028880","3029680"," We're going to set them up."
"3029680","3031100"," We're going to chart them out for you."
"3031520","3035120"," Into the clothes today and take a look or set them all up. "
"3035180","3036900"," Let me take a quick look here."
"3037720","3039000"," Tight one quick second."
"3039860","3040840"," Turn that off. "
"3041140","3041860"," Turn that off."
"3044240","3045020"," Now I'll put the."
"3049440","3052580"," You see here we're getting a little bit of a flattening action right now. "
"3052640","3053640"," Just a warning to you."
"3054020","3057260"," We're getting a little bit of a flattening action right now in the early trigger."
"3057460","3058440"," It's starting to roll over. "
"3059700","3061840"," So just a heads up if you're a bull."
"3062660","3066320"," That there is a role setting up on the early trigger right now."
"3066320","3072280"," Yeah, there's a role in the early trigger right here. "
"3072440","3073920"," I might grab some puts here."
"3080400","3083080"," They're charging so much fucking money for puts."
"3088260","3090880"," I got some four fifty twos. "
"3094320","3098660"," There is a little bit of a role going on in the early trigger."
"3099040","3100820"," I don't know if you can see that or whatever, but."
"3102960","3105940"," I got some four fifty two P's. "
"3106640","3108420"," I don't think we're getting down there, but."
"3110860","3112980"," I own some right now just heads up."
"3113440","3122460"," A role going on the background here. "
"3129980","3133570"," All right, I'm going to leave those."
"3133570","3134470"," I'm not going to fuck with them."
"3135670","3140230"," And then right now in the background, I'm also going to be working on these tickers. "
"3140410","3147830"," So as I bring them up, we will leave this chart and start setting up some trades for earnings"
"3147830","3148350"," reports."
"3150370","3169100"," All right,"
"3169680","3172420"," just one second here almost there."
"3174680","3179980"," I feel like a doctor sometimes. "
"3182880","3184080"," Almost there."
"3202070","3205770"," I'm going to show you guys a cool website here really quick so you can follow along at home."
"3206830","3208490"," And you can learn how to do this on your own. "
"3210310","3211390"," A couple cool things."
"3213070","3214870"," So we mute this really quick."
"3215310","3216630"," You guys don't need me to do this. "
"3219610","3221450"," I just do a quick Google search."
"3222170","3226370"," And I like this website because it's simple."
"3227210","3229150"," I'm always looking for simple whenever I can. "
"3229530","3237330"," Some of you guys have time where you can spend weeks or days or nights doing all this research for"
"3237330","3237670"," myself."
"3238790","3240210"," I don't spend as much time."
"3240570","3243050"," I will try to be as fast as possible. "
"3243870","3251110"," So this is options.ai. And what I'll do is you can do a Google search at home."
"3251610","3256390"," Just Google search options.ai and then space bar and then type in earnings."
"3257390","3260170"," Your first return should be this website. "
"3261470","3264050"," I'm not sponsored by these guys in any way shape or form."
"3264250","3266750"," I have zero sponsors and they were taking a sponsor on here."
"3267410","3273570"," But that gives you a quick and dirty listing of companies that are reporting by day. "
"3275370","3277350"," And then it also gives you."
"3278290","3281070"," So right was by the week and this is by the day."
"3281290","3283850"," And then it also gives you an expected move. "
"3285110","3287450"," Tells you the announcement time and then expected move."
"3287590","3288470"," This is important here."
"3289230","3290190"," The expected move. "
"3290810","3295350"," And one of the reasons this is important for me at least is I'm looking for vol right."
"3295930","3300290"," I'm looking for like UBS has a 10.5% move expected."
"3301470","3307490"," The more of all that you see in these moves snap 19.2% for today. "
"3307770","3308710"," It's a pretty big one, right?"
"3309470","3314070"," Manhattan associates 7.3%. I'm looking for vol in these moves, right?"
"3314510","3316730"," Tenable holdings is another one."
"3317450","3320710"," I want to see the expectation of what happens."
"3321550","3322910"," Any X is another one. "
"3324230","3324790"," AUB."
"3326030","3330210"," And I like looking at these expected moves so that I can make some money."
"3330730","3338350"," I'm not trying to trade something that's got a 1.8%. I think Corning is I think Corning might be"
"3338350","3339970"," one of the Wall Street bets. "
"3340610","3345370"," I could be wrong on that, but I think that's a Wall Street bets expected one today, but you know,"
"3345390","3348410"," like 1.8%. I'm really not trying to trade those."
"3348590","3350190"," Some people would go against that thesis."
"3350570","3356350"," They'd say, yeah, if we only have an expected move of 1% and it moves 5% you're going"
"3356350","3358370"," to get paid so much more, I guess. "
"3361670","3365390"," Personally, I'm looking to see what the expected move is going to be on these tickers."
"3367490","3372570"," So we'll start with we're going to start with after the bell today."
"3372790","3377770"," We've got Microsoft 4.7% expected move. "
"3378170","3380590"," So we'll switch over to MSFT really quick."
"3384390","3386170"," We're going to take a look at these guys here."
"3388790","3391230"," And they're coming into their earnings report. "
"3393210","3395250"," They've got a bear cross forming right now."
"3395270","3399130"," You can see it right here at 3, 4, 7, 0, 8."
"3399990","3402010"," They've got a bear cross already forming."
"3402210","3404730"," They're kind of bearish at the moments on a five minute chart at least. "
"3407290","3411530"," I know a lot of you are bullish on Microsoft heading into their earnings."
"3413570","3415610"," That's why I read somewhere somewhere."
"3415870","3420390"," Somewhere someone said something about Jerome Powell mentioning AI. "
"3421030","3422690"," It is speech tomorrow."
"3423230","3425390"," It drops the mic and walks away."
"3430170","3439510"," They haven't expected move of 4.7%. It's really a Microsoft here. "
"3439510","3445510"," And we're going to look at some important figures here."
"3446310","3449430"," Some important things that you want to know about."
"3452630","3457930"," So Microsoft right off the bat coming into the end for them today. "
"3458630","3466450"," I've got right here."
"3474160","3475900"," This is their hourly trigger."
"3488170","3488950"," Right there. "
"3489050","3497790"," The daily trigger is down here at 3.40. Right down here."
"3530940","3531540"," Ooh."
"3535770","3538090"," It'd be a nasty move right there, right?"
"3555550","3557470"," Man, that'd be a nasty move right there. "
"3557670","3557990"," Look at that."
"3569450","3570650"," Nasty move."
"3593110","3595070"," So the expected move right here. "
"3648360","3650620"," That's pretty much for Microsoft."
"3655440","3658120"," Let's take a look at Microsoft in their 30 minute."
"3670950","3673410"," It's a 30 minute chart on Microsoft. "
"3675390","3676830"," Extremely bullish here, right?"
"3677550","3679330"," Nice tags on their daily."
"3679330","3680990"," One, two, three, four, five."
"3681630","3684030"," They're back on their daily right now. "
"3685030","3690130"," There is something to note here where they are rolling over slightly."
"3690410","3690870"," You can see."
"3691190","3692110"," I want you to see this here. "
"3693990","3699950"," When you see that daily decline here, even though price is going higher, there is."
"3701850","3703030"," You see it right."
"3703450","3707130"," Momentum is slowing, even though price is grinding higher. "
"3709450","3714670"," This is your target to the downside down here, 310, 309, something like that."
"3715250","3719030"," You've also got zigzag channels saying we're heading down over here."
"3720950","3724410"," You've got another target even lower, 269, 28. "
"3725390","3728730"," So definitely worth an idea here."
"3729030","3734870"," If Microsoft has a bad earnings, in any way, shape or form, I do expect that 3.48 to break."
"3735170","3737790"," They're claiming that the options market is only to 330. "
"3737790","3740850"," But just like Tesla, you get a breakdown below here."
"3741610","3742230"," One, two."
"3742870","3747470"," And this is that outside move that you're not expecting into tomorrow. "
"3747470","3749210"," It's pretty big downside move, right?"
"3750590","3751370"," I don't know."
"3751530","3753790"," Let's check and see what those."
"3754590","3755490"," Let's check and see. "
"3756210","3758830"," Well, like 308s are going for right now."
"3760570","3761350"," Right here."
"3786660","3789260"," It's like three tens or 36 cents. "
"3791120","3796260"," Three thirties are two dollars and 75 cents like stupid."
"3797100","3806220"," Two dollars and 70 cents for puts on Microsoft tomorrow for two dollars and 70 cents."
"3807740","3817680"," And this options chain is stacked for an upside move stacked for an upside"
"3817680","3818360"," move. "
"3819500","3822460"," It's like all calls into tomorrow."
"3822920","3829560"," Like prime set up for our downside move into the close today."
"3833980","3837700"," Stacked for a downside move into tomorrow. "
"3837900","3840940"," Now, the expected is only to 330."
"3841920","3845880"," I personally don't even like the price of puts down here."
"3846500","3851180"," Like I don't like the I don't even like the idea of getting down here and then the bounce. "
"3851820","3852560"," I'll be honest."
"3852820","3853360"," I don't even like."
"3853560","3853860"," I don't even. "
"3854240","3855880"," I guess if I was to trade."
"3857400","3860640"," If I was to trade Microsoft into this close today."
"3863220","3864960"," Maybe like a lot of ticket. "
"3869940","3871900"," Yeah, I think a winky if you're a."
"3872160","3873860"," Well, I got to get in touch with winky really quick."
"3874860","3876920"," I'll be honest."
"3883680","3885780"," I don't like I don't like anything in Microsoft. "
"3886020","3890980"," I don't want to buy three dollar calls on Microsoft or three dollar puts on Microsoft."
"3891540","3893540"," You've got the expected move up here."
"3893640","3895040"," Maybe something a little bit higher. "
"3896740","3897560"," You know what?"
"3897700","3898500"," I'll be honest with you."
"3898700","3899740"," You can likely get."
"3901780","3906120"," You could likely it would probably be better for you to be a straddle seller. "
"3907340","3910520"," In here like be a be a seller of straddles."
"3911300","3915540"," Up here and down here or to synthetically trade this."
"3916820","3918520"," Inside of the after hours. "
"3918520","3919600"," I'll be honest with you."
"3919900","3924140"," The only way that it be a buyer of options here might be like."
"3927100","3931040"," Some kind of a put buyer below here. "
"3931060","3933020"," It would only be a lot of ticket."
"3934600","3937440"," 30 cents, 35 cents, something like that."
"3938160","3942040"," But even then the probably buying options, the better bet is to just be a."
"3943000","3945260"," To just be a synthetic trader. "
"3946380","3948200"," For like 15 minutes after that bell."
"3948640","3952420"," I don't I'm not happy with looking at Microsoft right now at all."
"3954920","3957720"," A little reversal here happening on spoons. "
"3958040","3962320"," I'm going to take off my watch in this reversal right now and take off these puts."
"3994300","3996500"," I'm back on the call side right now."
"3996500","3998940"," This has reversed itself to the upside. "
"4000340","4003120"," Sitting on 46 C's right now."
"4004880","4006840"," That's spy really quick for you."
"4007360","4008540"," I just back to Microsoft. "
"4010000","4012260"," Just going back to Microsoft here."
"4012620","4016780"," I'm not really a fan of trading this into this bell."
"4018800","4022060"," I'd be a seller of options on this trade for Microsoft. "
"4022200","4025200"," Seller of options above and seller of options below."
"4026880","4030780"," Selling like 3 30s and 365s."
"4032600","4035280"," If you're not going to be a seller of options on this trade. "
"4036020","4041160"," That's a giant like talking about a giant by open."
"4043120","4046100"," You know right there and then something like this."
"4050020","4054760"," Yeah, I'm not I'm not I'm not liking Microsoft as a as a trade. "
"4055060","4060340"," I like Microsoft as a trade after the bell through cues or or spy."
"4064660","4066800"," Let's see if there's anything else I can see here."
"4069240","4071880"," 15 minute it's looking a little bearish. "
"4073800","4076520"," It's got still a reversal showing up here."
"4080000","4082120"," One hour in decision."
"4084720","4091740"," Four hour needs to get above 347 63 to be considered bullish. "
"4096460","4098680"," I'm not seeing anything that I like on Microsoft."
"4099340","4103260"," Let me know in the chat what you think about Microsoft taking these earnings seems like it's it's"
"4103260","4104160"," priced into me."
"4106880","4108760"," Watch this one after the bell today. "
"4112800","4114140"," It's weird to I."
"4116779","4120580"," I read everybody's take on Microsoft after the."
"4121140","4124620"," I read everybody's take on Microsoft on into it."
"4124620","4126120"," And I'm like none of this shit matters. "
"4128600","4131080"," I'm so like such a sociopath."
"4131279","4134720"," I'm like I'm like none of this matters in any way shape or form."
"4140890","4144229"," That's going to show up to twitch cut and started to bait war with chick point. "
"4144770","4146950"," Liquidity pool pumpers a fuck yeah I would."
"4152500","4156640"," Yeah, I I'm a I'm looking at Microsoft and I'm like."
"4157540","4160439"," I'm like you are totally set up to lose. "
"4162220","4164540"," As the put buyer end of call buyer."
"4164979","4168380"," You're going to get that fucking ball crush and they're going to kill you."
"4170600","4173600"," If you want my what I think is going to happen tomorrow Microsoft. "
"4173720","4175200"," I think it goes down."
"4175540","4176479"," I'll be honest with you."
"4177100","4178319"," Or you know it'd be great. "
"4179020","4180720"," Is if they just pin it."
"4181520","4184220"," They just destroy puts and calls."
"4184279","4187120"," It looks like it's pretty well priced in. "
"4200340","4206620"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"4207260","4208920"," This is a fool's trade."
"4210720","4215100"," I think the bear and bull trade on this on that ticker is a fool's errand. "
"4217800","4221220"," You know you can't close them at four fifteen even if it goes up right."
"4221620","4222880"," Are they actually going to print."
"4223920","4224740"," I don't think so. "
"4227300","4228280"," Trade is dead."
"4231320","4233640"," Sweet making some money back on the call side here."
"4235160","4236840"," Not losing any money at this point. "
"4237240","4238800"," So we'll see how this works itself out."
"4241780","4243940"," Yeah, I hopped out of the puts and jumped in call side."
"4244840","4246740"," As soon as we reverse to the upside here. "
"4246980","4247780"," So right down here."
"4248460","4249140"," Hopped in some puts."
"4250280","4251760"," Watch the reversal taking place. "
"4252520","4254760"," Cut the puts and went to the call side right here."
"4271760","4273900"," So there's meta or that's Microsoft."
"4274700","4276520"," Well, do Google and then snap. "
"4277740","4282540"," Someone was asking about U.N.P. I'll do a quick take on U.N.P. if you want."
"4285600","4287720"," It's riding on its hourly trigger right now."
"4287840","4289240"," You want me to tell you where I'd be a buyer?"
"4289680","4297460"," 208.79. You can buy right now where it's sitting on 216.75 with a stop underneath it. "
"4298600","4300160"," Exactly where it is right now."
"4300160","4304880"," You can buy U.N.P. But I'd be a buyer below personally."
"4305140","4308680"," If we break below that at any point, we have a closing 30 minute bar. "
"4309440","4313620"," I would wait for a dip buy down below at 210."
"4314660","4315160"," 210."
"4316580","4317600"," Squeezing higher now. "
"4317740","4322140"," Try to tag this yellow bar right here."
"4332410","4335270"," I'm up one penny right now on these calls."
"4343640","4344160"," SMRT. "
"4344460","4345580"," I can look at that briefly too."
"4345780","4346660"," It's one of our tickers."
"4347740","4350060"," That was one we were watching right SMRT. "
"4351260","4355500"," And then next up I'll do a I'll do Google alphabet."
"4356620","4358300"," SMRT is about to explode man."
"4359020","4360480"," Good choice on SMRT. "
"4360680","4361880"," We'll take a look at this one really quick."
"4362720","4364300"," Good shout out on SMRT."
"4365960","4368940"," So SMRT ready to rock dude. "
"4370380","4373700"," SMRT daily trigger coming up underneath price above the hourly."
"4374060","4380040"," And DT has a one, two, three, four trigger cluster for a move higher right now."
"4380560","4384540"," SMRT bull is looking to trade five fifty right now. "
"4384800","4386220"," Good at good eyes on this one."
"4386500","4387520"," This one's ready to go man."
"4388200","4389900"," This one's ready to bang it out really fast. "
"4390620","4393440"," So yeah, bullish is all fuck right now on it."
"4394460","4396980"," Looks the zigzag saying down move."
"4397160","4403720"," But as long as you stay above three dollars seventy cents, your bullish stops below a closing bar"
"4403720","4405440"," on three seventy SMRT. "
"4406460","4407540"," Good shout out on that one."
"4409220","4410860"," They gave me another penny here."
"4412020","4413860"," Oh God these fucking dealers man. "
"4414540","4417300"," They gave me two fucking pennies on this trade so far."
"4418500","4420560"," Now they're going to try some bullshit in here."
"4420720","4422480"," And then that that noise right there. "
"4425340","4426820"," Fucking what a grind here."
"4428740","4433240"," So that's SMRT and SMRT and UNP."
"4433600","4435380"," I'm going to do Google next. "
"4435700","4438420"," I'm expecting I think I should do snap next."
"4438820","4444260"," I'm going to do snap next because snap has a little bit more of all."
"4445080","4447020"," Let's take a look at snap and see what it's saying. "
"4447280","4447820"," I like snap."
"4448620","4450200"," Let's talk about snap here."
"4452060","4455200"," Snap looks a little bit juicier than Microsoft. "
"4457060","4459360"," I'm going to assume Google is similar."
"4460400","4462340"," I'll look at Google but snap right now."
"4462480","4463940"," I liked it because it's a."
"4464800","4467140"," What was its implied move here?"
"4468240","4469520"," It's snap really quick. "
"4471100","4474560"," You'll find snap here."
"4476820","4483460"," Yes snap has a 19.2% expected move in the overnight."
"4483900","4485500"," So I am interested in this one. "
"4485700","4489820"," Maybe not in an options trade but an underlying trade."
"4491440","4497900"," If they have a bad report and they were to drop 19% it might be a nice dip buy."
"4500240","4502020"," Let's look at snap really quick. "
"4504720","4506860"," Snap a little top heavy here."
"4507860","4510080"," You can see the roll right now."
"4510220","4511260"," This is snap by the way. "
"4511340","4514740"," You can see the roll right now to the downside right."
"4515700","4519680"," You can see this roll also right here in price and snap."
"4519880","4522940"," They're expecting a 19% move on it. "
"4526700","4528460"," It's pretty significant right."
"4532540","4535520"," 10 flat $10 from 1256."
"4536660","4540320"," I'm going to assume this in pretty decent shorts on this right now. "
"4542120","4546580"," Then an upside move 19% is huge $15."
"4547960","4549340"," $15 and $10."
"4549780","4551080"," This might be a good trade. "
"4552480","4555820"," This might make a nice call and put spread."
"4557380","4563280"," Expiring not their nearest expiry but the next one for an up and downside move."
"4563280","4564540"," It's pretty significant here. "
"4576390","4578630"," And I like that dip buy down there."
"4580510","4582430"," Keep your eyes on snap today."
"4583170","4585190"," That might be the one that I'm going to focus on. "
"4590390","4592950"," You can catch a dip buy down here like this."
"4597460","4599460"," It's the 14th right there."
"4600260","4601040"," Of August. "
"4602780","4604440"," You can catch something like that."
"4604620","4606820"," It's a nice regular printer in here."
"4607860","4610580"," I don't think even if snap does rip on this. "
"4610820","4611720"," You lose it."
"4611860","4612100"," Who cares."
"4612440","4615780"," But if it comes down here and you can buy the underlying at $10. "
"4617160","4618180"," I like snaps."
"4618660","4619080"," I like snap."
"4619320","4623400"," I'm hoping snap earnings are bad so I can buy a dip on them. "
"4625820","4626880"," So that's snap."
"4628180","4630260"," I'll chart that one out in the background here."
"4630400","4631420"," Let me see if I can do this on another. "
"4631700","4634820"," I'll do this on a chart so you guys don't have to look at it if you're watching this trade"
"4634820","4635240"," right here."
"4635860","4637980"," So I'm going to chart this one in the background on snap."
"4640420","4642000"," So we have it for later today. "
"4644960","4649420"," So keep you know what I would do is if you're at home."
"4651600","4652680"," If you're at home."
"4656890","4662810"," You could probably set an alert on that 19% or I'd make it like 18%. "
"4663790","4666330"," Maybe 15% up and downside."
"4666950","4670890"," If they hit either one of those sides, look to sell it or buy it."
"4674710","4676810"," That's a great reaction trade by the way. "
"4678090","4680070"," Dude, they're not paying me at all on this shit."
"4680830","4682910"," Come on, man, pay these fucking calls, baby."
"4696430","4696950"," Snap. "
"4697750","4698130"," Hmm."
"4698250","4699410"," What are their, what are their."
"4704380","4706240"," Look in their options chain really quick. "
"4710340","4714040"," Yeah, I got like August 11th or 18th."
"4716400","4719780"," I mean, look at the 18th expiry for them."
"4729450","4736050"," So a $10 P on August 10th or 18th is only 45 cents. "
"4736050","4742370"," There's not a lot of interest in that trade, but 44 cents really cheap."
"4742710","4744690"," August 18th, 10 P."
"4746850","4749930"," And then the upside move on that trade."
"4751910","4758790"," Let's call it $15 is a 86 cents. "
"4760630","4767130"," So you could probably put something together for the 18th of August on the up and downside for like"
"4767130","4768810"," $1.50 or something like that."
"4769670","4772890"," And likely hit both sides by the time you get there."
"4774710","4777690"," You'd likely be able to take money on both sides of that trade. "
"4778770","4782010"," Very low cost, very cheap, and some time on it."
"4782170","4784450"," It's about a month out on that on that trade."
"4787610","4788410"," That's snap. "
"4794180","4796040"," So then just tweet soft landing."
"4799620","4800700"," I own key, baby."
"4800920","4801160"," Love them. "
"4801560","4804360"," I see you guys talking about it on Wall Street bets."
"4805480","4808780"," I haven't said anything on the stream, but I don't know who you guys are."
"4808920","4809480"," They're doing that. "
"4809520","4814140"," But some of you guys, so I got Wall Street bets and we started charting that shit a long time"
"4814140","4814540"," ago."
"4815400","4821200"," And I saw a few of you talking about I own queue and nobody would give you up votes and"
"4821200","4823760"," I didn't say a word because I didn't want to be accused of."
"4824580","4826440"," Oh, shit, I got to go back and look at my calls. "
"4826760","4830960"," I don't want to be accused of like trying to push that ticker, but I saw you guys on there"
"4830960","4831620"," and then recently."
"4833080","4834320"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"4834460","4835220"," Make me some money. "
"4835660","4837080"," Make me some money."
"4841200","4842740"," Make me some money."
"4844400","4847600"," Make me some money on spy, baby. "
"4850360","4855140"," I see you guys posting I own queue right now on Wall Street bets and you're getting likes."
"4855320","4857040"," So I'm very impressed."
"4859260","4860600"," I like it. "
"4860740","4864660"," We call out tickers and they start to become memes on Wall Street bets."
"4865140","4865740"," I have noticed."
"4866700","4867880"," I want you to know that I've noticed. "
"4876460","4878080"," Thanks for the context, Omar."
"4878800","4882420"," It's meant to be market should brace for a DPS recession and wants to rank one percent interest"
"4882420","4883700"," point recap by Fed Reserve."
"4884520","4885860"," One double line capitals. "
"4887060","4887940"," Jeffrey Sherman."
"4891680","4894440"," Oh, you're shitting me."
"4894740","4896320"," Phil Hammons started hocking on Twitter. "
"4896940","4898120"," You know, I got to say something."
"4902100","4903400"," Stop resisting sellers."
"4904180","4905460"," I got to say something. "
"4905620","4909540"," I've noticed on fin to it that a lot of our tickers are being hocked right now."
"4909860","4911500"," I noticed it recently."
"4912700","4914020"," Some people that follow me. "
"4914100","4915060"," High follow count people."
"4915180","4918400"," I'm not going to name names like a one five dollar account that falls that I follow him."
"4918760","4921240"," He's like, he's like slamming them out there right now. "
"4921760","4922760"," It's kind of cool to see."
"4923920","4927460"," So these things are actually taken off, which got really nice to see actually."
"4927460","4928700"," Come on now. "
"4928880","4930080"," Pay these fucking calls."
"4933100","4935240"," Pay these fucking calls."
"4935540","4936160"," Trade up there. "
"4955520","4957540"," Pay these fucking calls."
"4957800","4959640"," I've got a pretty high sell."
"4965010","4967330"," See if we can get a nice fat green bar up here. "
"4975400","4982160"," Yeah, you know, you know, it's like snap is like, you know, I got to be honest with all of"
"4982160","4982600"," you out there."
"4983020","4983880"," I really don't."
"4987420","4988300"," Hold on here. "
"4992230","4993910"," I'm really not a."
"4998750","5003010"," Like, so like I do fundamental analysis for you guys."
"5005370","5012730"," Because I don't ever want to be accused of, you know, like why like it's like that guy from CNBC,"
"5012730","5013390"," right?"
"5013570","5014910"," Like, why are you trading this ticker?"
"5015630","5016770"," Because it's going up."
"5016890","5017610"," What do you know about it?"
"5017830","5018170"," Nothing. "
"5018750","5020650"," Don't be accused of being a pumper."
"5022930","5024590"," So I try to not try to."
"5024710","5026550"," I only pick the picks that we have here. "
"5026630","5028370"," I'll have great or great fundamentals."
"5030310","5035370"," But there are, you know, just as many tickers out there that have dog shit fundamentals."
"5036430","5038590"," They're doing that do the same thing, right?"
"5038750","5039850"," They go to the fucking moon. "
"5041470","5043150"," So it's kind of hard."
"5043150","5047070"," I'm not really I used to be a fundamental analysis kind of guy."
"5048370","5050750"," Now I pretty much personally. "
"5051830","5054350"," I really don't care about fundamental analysis."
"5055710","5058510"," I care mostly about are they committing fraud?"
"5059950","5064710"," Have they lied in their guidance or not updated their guidance kind of stuff?"
"5065750","5071210"," But I do believe that they will sell, you know, market makers will sell anything."
"5072610","5075510"," They'll sell fucking, they'll sell burning tires in New York. "
"5075890","5081310"," So I do though for you guys try not to ever go over tickers."
"5081450","5085590"," I'm not trying to have a, I have requirements like it has to be this and it has to be"
"5085590","5085850"," that."
"5086510","5087230"," Come on, baby. "
"5087530","5088390"," Print these fucking things."
"5089330","5092630"," Print these fucking things for me."
"5092870","5094550"," Please give me the fucking money. "
"5098560","5100480"," Give me the fucking money."
"5108720","5109940"," I'm going to take it here."
"5121400","5121880"," Yeah. "
"5122000","5123620"," What does upstart actually do exactly?"
"5124400","5125360"," Does it fucking matter?"
"5126400","5127700"," No, it's going up."
"5129920","5144380"," Yeah, the"
"5144380","5145660"," dead silence on that."
"5145800","5147300"," Like what does what does upstart do?"
"5147700","5153540"," He's like, all he has to say is, I mean, all he had to say was, what the fuck do"
"5153540","5154680"," I care what upstart does?"
"5155360","5156240"," I don't care. "
"5158300","5162140"," And, you know, that's, and that's the thing is that's where the fifth wall breaks."
"5162440","5165800"," That's where, that's where people tell you that fundamental."
"5166180","5167740"," I mean, they do matter to an extent. "
"5168460","5170320"," They do actually matter, but."
"5171820","5174440"," You know, do they matter in a."
"5175540","5177240"," Like does it, does it really matter?"
"5177480","5178940"," I mean, look at Schwab."
"5179840","5181880"," Like Schwab got taken to the woodshed, right?"
"5181880","5182920"," Schwab's a bank. "
"5183400","5187560"," Schwab's in every corner of every small town in the United States of America."
"5188540","5192220"," And they were selling Schwab like it was going out of style, but we already knew they had a short"
"5192220","5195300"," on regional banks back in February, right?"
"5195460","5196880"," They tried the same shit with Budweiser."
"5196960","5198160"," They wanted that last leg down. "
"5198900","5203080"," So, you know, it's about getting cheap prices on these companies, right?"
"5212910","5216770"," Let me look at something here."
"5224240","5226820"," If I looked at most some mosaic, right?"
"5227100","5228340"," So we'll talk about mosaic really quick."
"5229680","5230780"," That's a good one to look at. "
"5230920","5232960"," So I got asked in chat if I looked at mosaic."
"5236140","5237060"," Let's talk about mosaic."
"5237520","5237680"," You ready?"
"5239480","5244010"," Are you ready for it?"
"5244010","5245510"," Not bullish here. "
"5247210","5248350"," Take the money and run."
"5251910","5252890"," You want my answer?"
"5253430","5254110"," Sell, mosaic."
"5255210","5256210"," Sell, sell, sell. "
"5256410","5256650"," I'm serious."
"5257830","5259150"," You sell mosaic here."
"5260650","5261990"," You take the money and run. "
"5262330","5265050"," There is no trade for you at this point."
"5265950","5269550"," This right here is a zone of volatility."
"5270330","5271830"," And you have no business trading it. "
"5272810","5272970"," None."
"5273750","5275070"," The trade is done."
"5275610","5282170"," The trade was from down here at $35.80. You're coming into a place where you take 75% of"
"5282170","5282590"," your winnings. "
"5283130","5285930"," You might, you can possibly renegotiate some calls."
"5286790","5292490"," If you wanted, like I would take all the money off the table, possibly renegotiate for a squeeze"
"5292490","5293270"," higher in here."
"5294470","5297330"," But I'd be looking for some kind of a move down lower. "
"5298590","5299630"," And then something like this."
"5300470","5301550"," And then you get your next move."
"5301550","5303530"," So do I think there's money here?"
"5303650","5304110"," Probably not. "
"5304590","5306590"," This could fill at any moment to the downside."
"5307630","5309530"," I'm not a fan of it where it is right now."
"5309970","5316010"," And to be honest with you, the next trade for me on mosaic would be above, would be above 43"
"5316010","5316430"," bucks. "
"5316890","5322950"," So it's trading $40.09. $0.09. I'll give you the next expectation."
"5325010","5325970"," Right there."
"5330440","5332260"," And then a steep drop off down here. "
"5334460","5335420"," Some consolidation."
"5336000","5336500"," Two."
"5339540","5340060"," Four. "
"5341280","5341800"," Five."
"5341960","5342980"," And then you get your actual move."
"5343860","5344620"," Right there. "
"5345700","5347580"," So none of this I'm interested in."
"5347740","5348920"," You could day trade this, I guess."
"5349840","5351640"," But not interested in it. "
"5352480","5354200"," I'm interested in this right here."
"5355620","5356960"," I'm interested in that."
"5357260","5359520"," If this happens later, it happens right here. "
"5359680","5360020"," I don't care."
"5360720","5363500"," But all this noise in here, I want nothing to do with it."
"5363500","5364420"," It's meant to grind you up. "
"5365400","5370420"," If it was to squeeze above and hold here and consolidate and begin to make the move higher and be"
"5370420","5371300"," interested in that."
"5372380","5374360"," Grabbing it above that 42 bucks."
"5374760","5377340"," But any of this in here, I've got no, no wants or needs. "
"5377940","5379500"," It's a place where it gets rolled."
"5380360","5380780"," Comes down."
"5381460","5384340"," Even if it breaks higher, you're going to get torch and calls in here. "
"5385120","5388400"," Next next buy in as well for this ticker would be."
"5388400","5394480"," If you're looking to take profit and if it does get rolled, next opportunity down here."
"5395840","5397320"," Thirty six, thirty seven bucks. "
"5398220","5398840"," Somewhere down there."
"5399100","5400760"," Most mosaic."
"5404360","5405180"," Nice shout out. "
"5420480","5421860"," Let's see what you guys are talking about."
"5421980","5423780"," You guys are, you guys have all kinds of call outs in here."
"5428510","5429010"," Right on. "
"5429250","5429770"," Right on man."
"5429770","5430810"," Right on on Dookie."
"5434900","5438180"," Now I took my money up here on spy. "
"5438360","5439100"," I'm flat right now."
"5439600","5440660"," So you've got the first."
"5441360","5442920"," You have the first move right here, right?"
"5444140","5444780"," Come down. "
"5445140","5446020"," Second move right here."
"5446400","5446440"," Boom."
"5447140","5447520"," Come down. "
"5447860","5448740"," Third move right here."
"5450400","5450920"," See it?"
"5451220","5451300"," One."
"5451740","5451880"," Two. "
"5452400","5452800"," And three."
"5453080","5453760"," You're larger move."
"5454660","5456860"," This will be your next entry on spy right here. "
"5457240","5458620"," I'm going to be looking to take that trade with you."
"5461600","5462740"," Right down in here."
"5463100","5465660"," Just waiting for another, another bar or two if possible. "
"5466900","5468560"," I'm not going to take this green bar."
"5468720","5471040"," I'm going to wait for this one more, this one more down move."
"5471280","5472620"," So if I miss this one, I miss it. "
"5473280","5474720"," It just goes straight up on the six."
"5474900","5475540"," I'll miss that trade."
"5487520","5487920"," TGT. "
"5488500","5490160"," We've talked about TGT, right?"
"5491120","5492320"," It's done quite well."
"5492520","5495140"," We talked about buying TGT and ATT."
"5496760","5498720"," You guys know what my thoughts were on that. "
"5499340","5503380"," So target has done what it was supposed to do, right?"
"5504000","5505600"," So let's take a look at TGT next."
"5506560","5509700"," We talked about this one when it was on its lows."
"5510960","5512840"," So we're going to take a look at target right now. "
"5513920","5515840"," Talked about buying target down here."
"5516240","5518920"," Talked about it coming up and breaking above."
"5519440","5522420"," It's our, it's daily trigger, which it has done. "
"5523500","5525700"," Congratulations to you if you're a target bull."
"5526920","5528760"," As long, I'm bullish here."
"5528960","5531200"," If you want to know, I'm not in sell mode on this one. "
"5531800","5535600"," So right here, long target right where it is."
"5535840","5536840"," Not financial advice."
"5544500","5545880"," Nothing's changed on target. "
"5546680","5547360"," Just consolidation."
"5548140","5548980"," Talk about this, right?"
"5549220","5551600"," You get above here and I want to show you something."
"5551800","5553060"," You get this move higher, right?"
"5554380","5557580"," And what you always want to see is the confirmation trade. "
"5558400","5562500"," Look back trade, you can call this a kiss trade, you can call this."
"5563180","5565500"," You always want to see this stuff right here."
"5566160","5570780"," What you never want to see is like the break above hourly or daily. "
"5571140","5571880"," But I want you to see this."
"5572020","5572500"," See this?"
"5573360","5574900"," It didn't break lower."
"5575240","5575900"," It didn't fail. "
"5577120","5581380"," And when you see this consolidation here, it's very productive."
"5581920","5583100"," Like this is productive."
"5583100","5589620"," As a bull, you'll oftentimes see someone out there say, whoo. "
"5589820","5591440"," It's squeezing, baby."
"5592320","5596300"," And it'll come right back down and people will try to buy this."
"5598080","5599980"," And there's no need to buy it. "
"5600640","5601340"," No need."
"5601740","5607600"," And no bull should be buying this right here because you should be hoping for this confirmation,"
"5608620","5611160"," this consolidation for a bigger move higher."
"5611160","5614460"," This is actually the best part of this trade right here. "
"5615100","5618660"," This is one of the best, one of the most juiciest parts of this trade."
"5619260","5625740"," We talk about these lookbacks and when a lookback fails, you know, yeah, you get a squeeze, but is"
"5625740","5634420"," it something that is going to produce even larger returns and sustainable returns, right?"
"5635160","5641860"," So is it just a squeeze or is it something where it's actually moving up and this is a very"
"5641860","5642900"," productive right here."
"5643040","5647700"," Just seeing this right here is what you want to see with a ticker like target. "
"5648100","5655180"," So saying that this is a nice place to buy a dip, nice place to put some stops underneath if"
"5655180","5658300"," you get some closing red bars in the 30 minute, right?"
"5658640","5661100"," Let's say let's say you buy this right here in target."
"5661640","5662880"," Let's say it bleeds down."
"5663620","5667040"," Let's say you're like, oh shit, I bought some calls and target starts to go down. "
"5667040","5674060"," You're still because of this right here going to be given an opportunity to get out of that trade"
"5674060","5677240"," before it makes a continued move to the downside."
"5677940","5683700"," So even if you get these calls here, nice pushing up right now, spy fucking just grinding through"
"5683700","5684240"," these sellers."
"5685100","5687300"," So target right now, very bullish. "
"5688120","5693640"," If it does, if it does blast through your stops, look for a place to unfuck yourself."
"5693640","5696420"," And then if you're like, well, I'm still bullish here cap."
"5696680","5701640"," You'd wait until it comes back up and confirms again to the upside and then enter. "
"5701800","5706980"," And you're right there right now on taking some risk on target, not financial advice."
"5708000","5710160"," So TGT, love it."
"5712980","5719040"," Spoons cranking higher right now, trading $4.55.25. I've got no skin on this part of the trade"
"5719040","5719540"," right here. "
"5720100","5721420"," I took my money back over here."
"5721420","5724280"," I was looking for a pullback onto the white line, didn't get it."
"5724560","5727400"," Now moving higher, trying to tag on. "
"5732620","5740600"," R1 right now, $4.55, $31.32, $45.46 right there."
"5741600","5745300"," Huge move and squeeze on spoons, baby."
"5746220","5755300"," Above R1, $45.46. Look at that, baby. "
"5755800","5759220"," Look at that move on spy."
"5760040","5760340"," Wham."
"5765030","5767010"," That's a beautiful fucking thing, isn't it?"
"5767270","5768590"," Look at that gorgeous thing. "
"5769510","5772050"," Look at that sexiness right there."
"5773070","5774830"," Look at that bad boy."
"5775850","5779630"," Just the baby arm, like the stiff baby arm right here. "
"5785120","5786520"," I made money, I'm happy."
"5786880","5787260"," I'm a good man."
"5787840","5791180"," $4.56 traded, $0.56 right now up here. "
"5791960","5795000"," $0.56, they were $0.41 earlier."
"5796000","5798620"," Still only $0.16 on that move."
"5798980","5802120"," I think I took it right here. "
"5803140","5805800"," Only paying $0.14 on that move."
"5807000","5812240"," That's implying that we have higher to go even right now due to range expansion."
"5812980","5818760"," The fact that it's only printed $0.14 saying we're not done going up. "
"5827370","5829010"," Not done going up."
"5841610","5843410"," Fubu and you."
"5843710","5844910"," We cover you here. "
"5846050","5848810"," Haven't covered it in, what, three sessions maybe?"
"5850810","5857670"," Unity getting ready for a buy right now on 4197, 4197."
"5859010","5863270"," Or if it trades above 4405, that's unity."
"5865530","5866090"," Fubu. "
"5867950","5875510"," I wouldn't trade, I wouldn't actually trade, I wouldn't actually trade unity yet to be honest with"
"5875510","5875670"," you."
"5876270","5877850"," There's better trades out there right now."
"5877950","5879630"," That TGT is a better trade right now. "
"5881270","5882890"," Fubu, same deal."
"5883970","5885430"," Fubu resting on it's daily trigger."
"5886230","5896170"," It's at $2.45. You could buy Fubu the underlying here and put a stop underneath $2.45."
"5897210","5900090"," The hourly trigger is coming down to meet you right now. "
"5900230","5902070"," The early trigger is getting a little bit more bullish here."
"5902730","5909710"," A price target to the upside is $2.75. And then you've got some work to do to get back"
"5909710","5919710"," up to $2.96 and ultimately $3.25. Look"
"5919710","5922250"," at that bad boy right there."
"5924750","5927050"," Next target to the upside. "
"5928690","5932510"," R2, 456, 59."
"5935330","5938730"," 456, 59."
"5951950","5955110"," Yeah, no, let's talk about you really quick. "
"5955570","5958870"," You're saying, so I want you to know that unity is on our buy list."
"5959410","5963430"," So we have a, we have a, we have an account for it."
"5963510","5965490"," So hold on, we'll talk about unity. "
"5967250","5969210"," I guess I heard some feelings here."
"5970110","5971450"," So let's talk about unity."
"5972790","5976150"," We'll go back and look back because Fubu is the same chart basically. "
"5976910","5977750"," So about unity."
"5978490","5980530"," And what to talk about unity here."
"5981310","5983230"," So we are bullish on unity overall. "
"5984350","5986530"," We're going to talk about unity specifically."
"5987690","5990670"," And what my, what my discussion means here for you in unity."
"5991410","5994330"," So I said to you on unity, two things. "
"5994610","5996790"," I said there's a buy down below here."
"5999290","6002390"," It's 42, 12, 42, 36 somewhere in here."
"6003250","6007690"," Price has not traded above the hourly trigger. "
"6008210","6010150"," You can see it's below the hourly trigger right here."
"6010530","6012330"," It's trading 43.89 right now."
"6013090","6014610"," I'm going to see this on a really, really tight. "
"6017110","6019090"," I'm going to explain to you something."
"6019970","6022210"," So it's not that you're not bullish on unity."
"6023290","6026470"," It's that I don't want to be a bag holder in here. "
"6027390","6031270"," So what I'm looking for is for unity to squeeze above, fail right here."
"6034640","6035600"," I'll show you right here."
"6037220","6043020"," For you to squeeze above, fail right there and hold above of the hourly trigger. "
"6043540","6043700"," Okay."
"6044380","6045380"," So that's what I want to see."
"6045880","6049400"," Now, if I'm an owner of unity, there's no real point, right?"
"6049500","6050480"," I'm just sitting on my hands. "
"6050520","6052040"," I can't participate in the market."
"6052680","6053360"," See what I'm saying?"
"6054540","6059220"," So I need you to get above $44.10 for me to take a trade here."
"6059780","6060180"," Okay. "
"6060320","6061800"," We're going to get rid of this red line right here."
"6061800","6063500"," Or yellow line right here to see you can see it."
"6064600","6071120"," And honestly, in here on unity, you've got right now, it's showing this here. "
"6071660","6072100"," Consolidation."
"6072980","6075680"," And then an eventual come down and bring it up."
"6075980","6076600"," You see what I'm saying?"
"6077220","6078200"," So what do I do?"
"6078340","6081320"," I get stuck in the middle of August and June with this kind of nonsense. "
"6081880","6082200"," Fuck no."
"6082580","6085280"," And there are a lot of tickers out there that you can get stuck in this."
"6085500","6091660"," Now, I'm bullish on unity, but I want to see that trade above to confirm that move higher. "
"6091860","6092400"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"6093080","6095840"," So I'd actually participate in that squeeze up here."
"6096860","6098500"," So I can trade that to $47."
"6099220","6100740"," So I'm not anti-unity. "
"6101700","6103820"," We've been talking about unity for a period of time here."
"6104000","6106900"," I want to say way down here at $34."
"6107640","6113040"," So I don't know where you were long, but if you were buying $34 or something like that, then you"
"6113040","6113900"," have nothing to worry about. "
"6114560","6117680"," If you're just entering unity up here at $40."
"6118280","6120460"," And I got nothing to say to you either, right?"
"6120700","6125000"," Like for me to buy unity, I want to be buying down here."
"6125200","6126120"," See that down there?"
"6126200","6128600"," I want to be buying that or I want to be buying above the hourly. "
"6128860","6129900"," And I want to show you what that means."
"6130540","6133520"," You want to be buyer there, buyer there, right?"
"6133660","6137600"," You want to be a buyer here and you're waiting for that same thing down here, right?"
"6138200","6140620"," Unity gets above and you're a buyer right there."
"6140800","6141320"," Does that make sense?"
"6143420","6145620"," Buyer, buyer, buyer, buyer. "
"6146040","6150440"," So right now a little bit early, same setup right now on Fubo."
"6151920","6157940"," By continuing its squeeze higher, you could see that it only printed $0.17. You're going to be"
"6157940","6160780"," looking for that move even higher, believe it or not."
"6160980","6168060"," So these calls print trading $4.56 on spoos right now. "
"6168600","6171660"," Or $4.55, $60, excuse me on spoos right now."
"6172180","6174660"," Looking for that $4.55, $90 up here."
"6174820","6175560"," See if we can get it. "
"6182170","6183650"," Yeah, lots of room career low."
"6184310","6185450"," I noticed it on this."
"6185770","6186890"," I noticed it here. "
"6187070","6188890"," I took profit."
"6190070","6192330"," I bought calls right here."
"6192890","6194170"," And right here, they only printed. "
"6195750","6196790"," I didn't print the time."
"6196970","6205170"," I think they printed $0.08. That move printed I think $14 or $0.17 total, $0.17 from here."
"6205470","6209350"," So that should be like a 100% trade right there. "
"6210210","6211290"," And it wasn't."
"6211410","6212810"," It was like a 40% trade."
"6213030","6215830"," So that's implying that there's more room to go up here. "
"6231420","6233240"," Give me a new entry on white line."
"6233760","6235920"," Here it comes, brother."
"6236740","6237580"," It's coming. "
"6237900","6238780"," You're almost there."
"6238780","6239340"," All right."
"6240300","6241560"," So we beat all these. "
"6241740","6242780"," We're going to get rid of these now."
"6243160","6243580"," Done."
"6243680","6244320"," Take that away. "
"6244560","6244800"," Done."
"6245060","6245700"," Take that away."
"6246380","6246860"," Done. "
"6247080","6247740"," Take that away."
"6248040","6248420"," Right."
"6248700","6249600"," Completed the trade. "
"6250540","6253500"," We're going to look for a dip buy down below here."
"6253880","6255560"," Uncle JBJ right down here."
"6257300","6259540"," See if we can catch a buy down here. "
"6262100","6264720"," Got another one down here for a DCA."
"6266640","6267980"," Right down here."
"6270140","6274640"," It's targeting R2, 456, 59. "
"6275320","6284960"," You've got some other places of interest, a failure of 456, 4606 for an extension of 456, 28, 456,"
"6285260","6288200"," 44, and 456, 59."
"6291920","6292800"," Hold on a second here."
"6294340","6297100"," I'm going to get to read some producers talking to me. "
"6307150","6307810"," I'm missing."
"6320780","6322060"," Hold on one second here."
"6333000","6334320"," Holy shit, Disney. "
"6334800","6350150"," Dude, that"
"6350150","6352490"," was that big dad move in Disney, Winky."
"6353170","6354510"," I think I want to buy calls here, man."
"6356170","6357330"," Hold on one second here. "
"6357970","6362850"," We're talking about Disney the other day about looking for a giant down move in it."
"6363430","6371830"," And it just double-bottomed on $85.29. Winky's saying that there's a price target of $76 on Disney."
"6372510","6374390"," I'm actually bullish on Disney here. "
"6375790","6380790"," But the other day on stream, I said Disney's trades like BA."
"6381750","6386270"," Where it'll get a nasty, you'll get a nasty wake up morning and it'll be down like a bunch."
"6386270","6387990"," And it's down a bunch right now. "
"6389410","6392230"," It was down yesterday in the 23rd, too."
"6393670","6394670"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"6398030","6403450"," So, Winky's saying price targets $76 given weeks ago. "
"6403790","6404850"," Now the street knows about it."
"6405010","6405770"," Careful with that one."
"6405850","6407710"," It's the biggest diz fan in Bull in the world. "
"6408470","6409410"," And I won't touch it."
"6409550","6411590"," Winky's not a fan of Disney right now."
"6411590","6420010"," And I was stating I took a contract approach to Winky's saying that you're looking for an entry on"
"6420010","6422390"," Disney on weakness like BA. "
"6422710","6424390"," Where you wake up one morning, it's down a bunch."
"6424570","6432530"," It's just double-bottomed right now in $85.21. Winky has a price target of $76."
"6434470","6436230"," But I'm not in that same camp. "
"6449270","6453310"," Yeah, I'm on the Disney trade here to go up."
"6454370","6455510"," I want to buy it."
"6455750","6459710"," I missed it back on the 30th of May. "
"6460330","6462350"," Let me take a look at it really quick on a higher time."
"6462490","6463170"," Give me a second here."
"6510620","6512200"," Let's take a look at Disney really quick. "
"6513260","6516400"," So I'm kind of contour this trade with Winky right now."
"6517660","6518540"," Go on here."
"6532140","6534160"," Yeah, I'm anti this trade with. "
"6534480","6537580"," I'm kind of against Winky."
"6538020","6542100"," I know that you're way smarter with me than stock picks."
"6544720","6547360"," But I'm going to say no to you. "
"6547560","6549320"," Well, not necessarily no to you."
"6550460","6555220"," So this is an outlook on this is a higher time frame outlook on Disney."
"6555220","6560220"," And I'm going to actually go against that trade. "
"6561680","6563620"," That Disney is not a buy."
"6564480","6574000"," So Disney here last time we've seen Disney down here was at $18 back in 2009."
"6574760","6577260"," Previous example was 2002. "
"6579040","6581920"," So we have not seen Disney down here."
"6582880","6584620"," In some times."
"6584640","6585960"," Let's look at it right now. "
"6588000","6588760"," You know what?"
"6588860","6590680"," You've got a price target of $76."
"6592040","6592520"," Shocker."
"6597030","6600690"," I'm assuming this is the exact line that they're looking for down in here. "
"6602890","6608690"," I'm going to assume that that link that you sent to me is for the expectation of down here at"
"6608690","6609050"," $76."
"6609820","6612950"," And the previous example."
"6613770","6616970"," The previous two examples that actually broke even lower. "
"6619250","6621350"," So 72 maybe."
"6622330","6624270"," I'll show you this right here real quick."
"6632020","6637240"," Last two prior examples of Disney getting down to its quarterly. "
"6637860","6640600"," Right down here and right down here."
"6640600","6643160"," There's one example of it not breaking through."
"6644160","6646720"," That's in 2000 to 2003. "
"6648040","6651020"," And there's one example of it actually breaking through."
"6659600","6664060"," So are you bearish winky just $276 or are you."
"6666600","6669900"," Do you think it goes lower than 76 or do you just think that. "
"6671460","6675640"," There is one example of it going lower."
"6675980","6677380"," So a break of $670."
"6679140","6683420"," Even if it's brief may put a stink bit below 70 bucks just in case. "
"6684560","6687260"," But this is a bottoming should be a bottoming here."
"6687720","6688780"," This I guess you would say."
"6689540","6694080"," If it broke below this level it would be the first time in history for Disney. "
"6694280","6695700"," Let's look on the entire history of Disney."
"6696420","6699420"," And see if there's another example of this."
"6704240","6706700"," Yeah, there's no pre there's no prior example. "
"6707840","6709260"," This is 1995."
"6711420","6718770"," I want to assume that that's an example there."
"6718870","6720410"," That's a big giant one right there. "
"6720590","6721190"," 1975."
"6728000","6736060"," 1975 was the last time that there was even more damage done."
"6738260","6740500"," So I guess even here. "
"6743280","6747040"," I guess even right here if you were to ever at any point see."
"6748080","6751220"," Any kind of like rejection on $70."
"6751760","6752720"," That'd be very wary. "
"6755200","6758420"," Very wary of a rejection below 70."
"6761700","6764180"," $74.51 like so let's put that on there."
"6769750","6772510"," $74.51 would be dangerous for Disney. "
"6773470","6776150"," Any kind of like any kind of like structure like this."
"6779030","6780910"," Let me tell you about Disney going even lower."
"6786270","6787450"," There's not much there. "
"6787630","6788990"," What is this 2011?"
"6789670","6790070"," Damn."
"6793560","6795180"," 2011 right there."
"6796360","6798060"," That's real support down there. "
"6799480","6800860"," That's real support."
"6802840","6804120"," That's real support."
"6804620","6806080"," $29 and $18. "
"6806560","6812480"," I got to put an order in for this right now."
"6817400","6818200"," Disney."
"6818900","6823020"," Winky with a price target of $76 on Disney. "
"6823640","6824600"," It's getting there."
"6824700","6825020"," It's close."
"6831520","6834720"," Yeah, I'm interested in some leaps on Disney here. "
"6834980","6839860"," Like I'm thinking to myself so I just get some leaps or so I don't care if it actually tags."
"6840520","6842120"," Let me look at Disney really quick."
"6863930","6866070"," December 19th of 25. "
"6868050","6872510"," They're 135 C's or $5.56. That's pretty cheap."
"6884860","6887640"," So some synthetic longs on Disney."
"6889460","6890580"," 135 C."
"6891380","6892560"," They're five and a half bucks. "
"6893920","6898820"," You could also put a stink bid on those in case there is another down moment or down day."
"6899020","6902080"," If you get a bad hawkish fed or something like that."
"6904780","6906260"," December 19th, 2025. "
"6906780","6914120"," The stink bid right now is $5.65. Put a bid in for like five bucks, $5.25, something like"
"6914120","6916480"," that on leaps on Disney."
"6917740","6919600"," December 19th 2025."
"6920940","6921900"," 135 C."
"6931480","6936040"," Now you figure on a, you know, like a two year leap then you don't really care if you go"
"6936040","6937780"," to do $76 or not. "
"6940720","6941920"," Nice shout out, Winky."
"6943000","6954920"," Let me see what"
"6954920","6955640"," else he texted me."
"6965160","6969100"," It's kind of weird like we talked about eight on a second here. "
"7051510","7052730"," Do one quick second here."
"7131780","7132880"," All right, I'm back."
"7133060","7133700"," Hold on one second here. "
"7135780","7145560"," Sorry, I got, I get my"
"7145560","7149340"," daughter texting me right now."
"7158430","7160910"," One quick second, I'm going to call a doctor."
"7161190","7161370"," Hold on. "
"7255980","7258840"," All right, sorry about that."
"7260100","7264060"," Hold on a second here."
"7268900","7271580"," This is sensitive to narrative switch. "
"7272260","7273340"," Are Hollywood strikes?"
"7273720","7274100"," Am I pinning?"
"7274240","7274840"," Good leap, can it?"
"7275160","7277840"," Yeah, I'm on the idea about this leaps right now."
"7280720","7284520"," Yeah, the Atlantic equities Winky had brought up this morning."
"7286520","7290720"," You're seeing that there's a price action across legacy media, Paris same deal. "
"7291100","7292280"," Disney needs to bring its dividend back."
"7292500","7294080"," So boomers bite up again."
"7294260","7297100"," You know, it's the first stock that my parents had for me. "
"7297580","7302260"," It was the first stock that I sold when I was a wee lad."
"7302260","7310560"," It would be nonsense."
"7310920","7312260"," Diz IP is generally intact. "
"7312700","7314280"," Apple type lock on the streaming audience."
"7316000","7322300"," I'm always looking for any kind of like death, like all those death trades where it's like it's"
"7322300","7323040"," never coming back."
"7323160","7324180"," It's going to the depths of hell. "
"7324960","7333060"," And I kind of nonsense to pick up and own those either own the underlying or own some leaps."
"7333060","7337200"," I think this is a good candidate for leaps rather than the underlying."
"7340340","7343400"," CRC is bullish as fuck to capture to Google. "
"7343940","7344960"," I haven't done Google yet."
"7345120","7346320"," I need to get back to it."
"7346860","7347340"," BBIG. "
"7347840","7348960"," Do we have a doctor in the chat?"
"7350020","7350500"," Yeah."
"7352360","7358220"," My daughter was texting me about an appointment and couldn't get in touch with my wife."
"7358460","7361980"," So I had to call my wife. "
"7361980","7364480"," It doesn't be great at $76."
"7366800","7368000"," I don't know."
"7368340","7370740"," I mean, you know, who else makes those calls?"
"7371200","7373480"," Like Mike Wilson makes those calls in that great line too. "
"7374080","7377880"," I can't say that it matters if it's at $76 or not."
"7378960","7384220"," I think the bigger the bigger concern would be if you get closing bars under $74."
"7385860","7388540"," Like closing kind of action underneath that. "
"7388680","7389460"," It could go even lower."
"7390520","7392160"," I think that's the bigger concern."
"7394640","7396000"," Can we talk about this?"
"7396360","7397200"," I think we talked about this. "
"7397580","7398260"," Oh, you live in Orlando."
"7399220","7400280"," And the parks are dead."
"7402060","7402980"," Oh, hold on a second. "
"7403100","7403740"," I had to grab some calls."
"7408440","7410140"," You know, I'm not really a."
"7418300","7421460"," Well, I want to take a trade there."
"7422000","7426180"," I'm not really a like whenever I hear bad news. "
"7427340","7430880"," I'm I'm not on the same team as sellers."
"7432980","7437360"," Like if it's already come down so much, I'm like, I don't really want to hear anything you have to"
"7437360","7437620"," say."
"7438140","7440520"," So I'm more or less. "
"7440940","7445280"," It's kind of like when you're in a top, you never hear anyone saying the sell."
"7445580","7448700"," So when we're down at a bottom or depths of how."
"7449640","7454800"," You know, like you cry one day and then like two months later, it's coming back up. "
"7456100","7457600"," Carries and prime example."
"7458140","7462760"," So like all the all the doom and gloom, whatever you hear, the doom and gloom or whatever you hear"
"7462760","7464660"," like the most bullish of bull."
"7465320","7467540"," You're just like, I can't fucking buy that anymore. "
"7467900","7468800"," There's no fucking way."
"7470540","7477400"," Sitting on 457s right now, I doubt that they print to 457, but I am on calls on this bar"
"7477400","7478280"," right here real quick."
"7481480","7482360"," You live in Orlando. "
"7482440","7482980"," Each bomb."
"7483200","7484200"," Tell us some more about Orlando."
"7485900","7492920"," You know, it's tough for me with like Disney is one of those stocks where there's so many shares"
"7492920","7493700"," out there. "
"7494200","7495660"," I agree with the dividend argument."
"7495740","7497640"," I agree with the parks may be being dead."
"7498360","7504500"," And the writer's strike is where it's fascinating what the writer's strike right now is. "
"7506840","7510600"," It should be resolved sooner than later."
"7511380","7514040"," Do you guys know how to know that?"
"7514920","7516840"," If that strike is to be resolved."
"7518760","7523120"," The two big issues right now is what I just watched this actually last night. "
"7523940","7525200"," Two largest issues."
"7526700","7530000"," Right now with Hollywood strike."
"7530860","7534680"," Is AI right. "
"7535300","7537540"," And residuals."
"7537980","7539640"," On streaming."
"7540260","7545700"," So if you're an actor male female carrier, you just an actor right. "
"7546260","7553460"," And you get paid for residuals on a film in theaters."
"7556220","7558420"," Then you stop making money."
"7558600","7562940"," This was the last strike was about this right generally speaking last strike was about. "
"7564680","7566860"," Residual payments on movies and theaters."
"7567480","7570700"," And so an actor would get paid for their time and service."
"7570700","7576840"," And then they wouldn't make any money on the residuals from that performance in a theater run that"
"7576840","7577320"," was successful. "
"7578100","7579700"," They didn't share in that money."
"7579700","7583820"," This there are other issues in the strike these two strikes."
"7584440","7591620"," But one of the main ones is that actors do not share inside of residuals from streaming. "
"7592220","7597820"," So if the movie is only in theaters for a very short period of time or and then directly goes"
"7597820","7599060"," to a streaming service."
"7599560","7604620"," Or if it is planned to be released in theaters but doesn't but never goes to a theater winds up"
"7604620","7605540"," in a streaming service."
"7605540","7609980"," And then these companies make money off of you for long periods of time right. "
"7610640","7615200"," And you also see them removing movies from streaming services and then putting them back up again."
"7615820","7621120"," And so you know you've got a movie that makes money in perpetuity but maybe not in perpetuity but."
"7622340","7626420"," In perpetuity but the but at least for you know 10 20 years 30 years. "
"7627380","7628800"," We make money again."
"7631360","7635240"," Well what happens is they're not getting those residuals."
"7635460","7637100"," And so that's the key point here. "
"7638160","7639000"," Hold on here."
"7648700","7650100"," We keep my eyes on this trade."
"7651060","7654760"," So you've got the main argument is that right they're not making money on residuals. "
"7655320","7656180"," So how would you."
"7659160","7664760"," How would you know if this strike is going to continue or not or if their demands are going to"
"7664760","7665800"," be met or not."
"7666640","7667680"," How would you know. "
"7668340","7675020"," And we can already tell that their demands are going to be met because you see streaming services"
"7675020","7680320"," across the board raising their their fees."
"7681100","7683220"," You saw YouTube just go up two dollars."
"7683220","7688520"," You saw Netflix just begin to try to take more money in. "
"7689740","7690560"," Fuck yeah."
"7692780","7698460"," Netflix just try to take some money in right there or they're asking people to pay more than one or"
"7698460","7699940"," two screens outside of the home."
"7700520","7704400"," Places like that you see increases across the board from these streaming services. "
"7704920","7710700"," And this is likely to pay the demands of actors for their residuals."
"7710700","7713180"," Now the AI thing something completely fucking different."
"7714140","7717080"," Some of the stuff that I read about that was was atrocious. "
"7718820","7721060"," I forget the big one that I read."
"7721960","7729200"," But there was a there was one company that was having people sign away all like this like him for"
"7729200","7730720"," the rest of their lives if they start."
"7731080","7734400"," I think there was I don't know if it was Lord of the Rings could have been Lord of the"
"7734400","7736060"," Rings or another movie or TV show. "
"7736680","7741020"," Where they were they were trying to get people to actors to sign away their entire their future"
"7741020","7741360"," life."
"7742280","7744100"," So it looks like they're going to win that."
"7744300","7746980"," So in the argument of streaming services or actors strike. "
"7747360","7749900"," I think that's resolved without even being resolved."
"7750180","7751760"," Now the the parks."
"7752760","7754260"," I can't speak to that. "
"7754380","7756980"," I haven't been to a Disney park in a long, long time."
"7759780","7762900"," Maybe you can talk about the parks how they're doing."
"7764660","7774540"," I just showed you two examples why I wouldn't clean up the lower"
"7774540","7774840"," bands. "
"7775140","7777920"," I just showed you two examples one where it did and one where it didn't."
"7779040","7780660"," So you've got no argument there."
"7787360","7788240"," Let me see here. "
"7788900","7790620"," $12 hood reports next week."
"7790820","7791760"," Everybody keeps harping on hood."
"7792720","7794480"," PayPal can solve for move higher. "
"7795460","7796260"," Tell a pounce here."
"7796900","7798900"," PayPal Orlando is so overpriced."
"7799680","7800300"," I mean how people work. "
"7801020","7801860"," Disney can live here."
"7802080","7802700"," I agree with that."
"7804300","7806660"," What they pay workers at Disney sucks. "
"7807380","7808300"," I know that for sure."
"7808440","7809440"," I've heard that argument before."
"7811820","7814240"," The new pay structure for fast passes. "
"7814700","7815040"," I am."
"7815200","7816540"," I have been Disney if you want to know."
"7817700","7818960"," And it's very expensive. "
"7819420","7821700"," It is a stupid expensive."
"7822500","7825280"," As now it does is probably longer term good for revs."
"7825640","7829880"," But have to get past the outrage over paywall for fast passes now. "
"7831800","7833960"," But annual passals come and go as they please."
"7834180","7835740"," The reservation system sucks and upset."
"7836320","7841100"," Do any of you think that Disney has the potential for moving out of Florida?"
"7842180","7845940"," I've heard some of that talk that they could move to Oklahoma or Texas. "
"7847520","7848960"," Have any of you heard that?"
"7849260","7850380"," Those rumors are being true."
"7850520","7852460"," They put holds on any kind of new construction."
"7857000","7860180"," Do you guys are calling out tickers like I couldn't I couldn't even. "
"7860180","7863040"," I couldn't even chart all these tickers if you wanted me to."
"7863320","7865380"," You guys are calling out crazy tickers."
"7871720","7872840"," Let us stick in here. "
"7874980","7877500"," Do you guys have tickers galore right now?"
"7882300","7885660"," We live in South Florida and cancel the pass for price increases."
"7885680","7887760"," Couple of reservations didn't see value in the past."
"7887980","7889940"," We couldn't on a whim go if we wanted. "
"7889940","7894900"," I am fascinated by some of you saying that it has nothing to do with politics."
"7895020","7896840"," It has to do with how much it costs."
"7902220","7904300"," That's concerning to read. "
"7908930","7909730"," What does it go?"
"7920600","7921500"," Don't wait a minute here."
"7921760","7923360"," I'm doing some wonky shit in the background."
"7926480","7930300"," I'm trying to fuck around buttons in the background and I'm not being successful with it. "
"7930880","7931820"," I am concerned with."
"7934800","7936100"," Yeah, I am concerned."
"7936560","7941160"," But whenever I heard the argument about it being because of politics, I was like, I don't want to"
"7941160","7941500"," hear that. "
"7942800","7946480"," But inside the chat, you guys are saying it's the all how much it costs."
"7946740","7947460"," That is concerning."
"7948660","7953000"," If you like make that decision, it costs too much for what I'm receiving in value. "
"7953600","7954660"," That is a fucking problem."
"7964200","7967100"," St. Walnut saying H bomb and I were just talking about the parks."
"7967220","7968920"," The ports came out about the parks being empty. "
"7968920","7970120"," Every time I go, they are packed."
"7970940","7972040"," It was just there two weeks ago."
"7977070","7982290"," Yeah, I'm doing Barry saying they said the same shit about CCL and CLH RCL. "
"7982290","7990570"," That's my take on this is the louder the bull scream or the louder the bear scream."
"7991130","7996610"," I tend to feel like that's the end of a bull run on a ticker or this is the end"
"7996610","7998470"," of a bear run on a ticker."
"7999110","8000690"," That's my general consensus. "
"8001170","8006450"," Now Disney, there is some concern with if they ever move."
"8006750","8007710"," I have concerns with that."
"8007830","8011250"," If they ever move out of Florida, that's a concern to me. "
"8011250","8012450"," Like that's a big red flag."
"8014890","8020970"," And then price of any time people are about legitimate stuff like, Hey, I don't want to pay for"
"8020970","8021370"," this anymore."
"8022930","8023850"," That kind of stuff. "
"8033930","8035310"," So no chance of that moving."
"8035570","8036210"," That's good to hear."
"8036370","8037170"," I don't want them to move. "
"8040030","8041750"," Yeah, they have too much infrastructure there."
"8041850","8042590"," I agree with that too."
"8046630","8047990"," They need more than 100 acres. "
"8048410","8050210"," They need way more than 100 acres."
"8053920","8057480"," Yeah, I was just in another conversation about the airports there too."
"8058060","8060300"," But how horrible the airport is to get into Disney. "
"8063360","8065160"," Yeah, I heard about the new theme park"
"8077100","8087580"," in"
"8089590","8089590"," Oklahoma."
"8089590","8092890"," Yeah, you know, like the Star Wars thing, the hotel boondoggle."
"8093310","8093930"," I agree. "
"8094050","8094750"," That was a disaster."
"8095790","8097990"," They're asking stupid money for that hotel."
"8098770","8099910"," It's like ridiculous. "
"8100270","8101690"," I think it was five grand, right?"
"8101950","8102270"," Six grand."
"8103310","8104470"," I thought that was out of control."
"8105030","8106290"," I thought that was a big boondoggle. "
"8106530","8108590"," The whole Star Wars thing is a boondoggle to me."
"8109010","8109550"," A head scratcher."
"8110770","8112050"," Someone put it really well. "
"8112210","8117430"," They said that like Star Wars should be shelved for 10 years."
"8118090","8120830"," So that you'd create demand again for it."
"8121410","8124810"," It's always good to shelve a property and then come revisit it. "
"8129070","8131470"," When saying a short since one 50."
"8131750","8132730"," Yeah, I'm sorry."
"8132870","8133450"," Remember that. "
"8134030","8136330"," I remember that that earnings winky."
"8136670","8140990"," I remember there was a big Disney bowl that made a lot."
"8141130","8142050"," I think we posted it here. "
"8142490","8146550"," There was a big Disney bowl that made a huge."
"8148490","8151790"," Like deep dive on Disney stock after that earnings."
"8152390","8158210"," I remember that earnings where people started like true Disney bowls started panicking up there. "
"8160090","8163210"," But right down it's like 70 bucks, $76, $80."
"8163810","8168730"," It reminds me of B.A. It trades like B.A. Like to see a move up or down one,"
"8168830","8170110"," two, three percent a day with."
"8170370","8174390"," It reminds me of B.A. It's always traded like that for me. "
"8175510","8178710"," It's like what's $76 a day, a one day move, maybe."
"8179470","8180930"," I'm not seen it as like."
"8182210","8183450"," As a big deal. "
"8185550","8186510"," Especially with leaps."
"8186810","8189510"," I don't I don't see it like being a concern in three months."
"8190790","8193110"," Or if you don't wake up one morning and take the trade. "
"8193770","8195530"," Do we miss the trade or something like that?"
"8207100","8208680"," You did just upgrade your report."
"8212040","8214240"," Yeah, Disney won't last any governor in Florida."
"8219760","8221480"," Yeah, it's not just Disney either. "
"8221639","8222920"," It's like everything that's around."
"8223240","8224840"," So a full disclosure."
"8225600","8228400"," I have a family friend that owns. "
"8230299","8232059"," Property surrounding Disney."
"8233520","8234120"," And."
"8236160","8238299"," It's not just Disney the park. "
"8238600","8241040"," So Disney used to be back in the day, right?"
"8241040","8245639"," Disney not only do they have all the bylaws and all that other kind of shit."
"8246420","8252000"," They bought everything surrounding the outside of Disney."
"8252540","8254860"," So but Disney back in the day, if you drove up to it. "
"8255340","8257299"," They were it became really scummy."
"8257940","8263200"," You'd have like a lot of like scummy like the first mile before you get Disney would be really a"
"8263200","8263700"," shit show."
"8264959","8268559"," And she ended up not selling to Disney. "
"8268559","8271280"," And she became a partner with Disney."
"8272360","8275219"," That she would only allow certain things on this property."
"8277740","8279820"," There's these properties outside of Disney. "
"8280520","8282500"," As a matter of fact, I went to the."
"8283840","8286440"," Whatever that that secret club is."
"8286980","8290000"," I've been in I got the passes where. "
"8291959","8295860"," Like the past nobody gets like I went down the secret hallways when I got there."
"8296379","8298959"," I got some I got somebody show me around the park."
"8299920","8301879"," I went to the secret restaurants. "
"8302379","8307219"," I like went through like this bayou thing near the bayou thing and a secret doorway and then I went"
"8307219","8308200"," up and had lunch and."
"8308920","8313719"," The first time I ever went I went there thinking I'd have to pay for my lunch that day."
"8315020","8320900"," So I bought like a bunch of high end booze and high end wine and I think my bill was. "
"8322420","8327540"," Over a thousand bucks one two grand something like that and I went to go pay."
"8329000","8330660"," And they were like no sorry."
"8331719","8333120"," You don't pay here. "
"8333959","8335900"," So my entire trip was free."
"8337680","8342959"," And I had no idea I felt so bad because I didn't know that if you're that person that it's"
"8342959","8343219"," free."
"8343860","8346920"," I think there's like 500 pass holders in the world. "
"8346920","8348120"," Maybe a hundred."
"8349000","8352820"," Usually presidents dignitaries are people that own a bunch of shit."
"8353120","8355340"," I guess this lady owns a bunch of land outside of Disney. "
"8355860","8360320"," So I think like even saying Disney's only a hundred acres like it's it's way more."
"8360920","8364379"," Their fingers are into everything around the parks as well."
"8367980","8369059"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"8369400","8372459"," But the Disney is like moving or Apple moving to hamburgers."
"8377549","8378990"," Yeah, I'm reading what you're saying right now."
"8378990","8380490"," I was lost in a hotel. "
"8380730","8381450"," It's all Disney margins."
"8381690","8383650"," They're the strikes and spin off TV divisions."
"8386309","8387890"," Yeah, they sell ESPN. "
"8390930","8393030"," Website is being worked on right now."
"8393350","8398270"," So right now after we get done streaming every day I'm working on it with the boys."
"8398790","8403870"," I mean, my fact I was in meetings last night until 11 p.m. I worked. "
"8404050","8404590"," I worked yet."
"8404810","8408470"," So when I got done stream with you guys yesterday I worked until 11 o'clock last night."
"8409430","8410310"," On the website. "
"8414050","8418030"," In four months I'll have to pay Comcast between 11 and 50 billion for the steak and hulu."
"8418630","8419190"," Doesn't know."
"8419270","8421610"," So if you're doing leaps I put them off after February. "
"8421870","8422590"," That's a good point, Winky."
"8423210","8428050"," Winky saying in four months I'll have to pay Comcast between 11 and 50 billion for the steak and"
"8428050","8428310"," hulu."
"8429150","8430950"," That Disney doesn't own. "
"8431130","8434710"," So if you're doing leaps I'd put them off until after February."
"8434830","8435870"," That's a very good point, Winky."
"8439130","8440450"," Pawn spy blast through. "
"8440650","8441890"," Couldn't imagine the moving away."
"8442230","8443570"," Ryan just became a member."
"8443770","8444830"," Thanks Ryan for coming to member. "
"8445850","8447230"," Star Wars was diluted."
"8447610","8447690"," Yep."
"8449670","8458830"," Yeah, there's a, you know, like I'm a pretty woke person and my kids, my wife and I, I don't"
"8458830","8461810"," like it in my entertainment. "
"8464630","8468430"," Or I don't mind it in my rent payments if it's written well too."
"8468970","8470190"," Like the whole woke thing."
"8471910","8474710"," You know, like it's like it goes right back to aliens, right?"
"8474990","8477210"," Goes right back to want you to write. "
"8477830","8479630"," I hate when they write a part."
"8480470","8481730"," I hate when they write a part."
"8483970","8488150"," Like, you know, like when they write a part for a hero and they put a person into that hero"
"8488150","8488590"," role. "
"8489110","8491450"," Rather than saying, well, it's, it's going to be this."
"8492650","8493090"," Minority."
"8493430","8494590"," That's, I find that frustrating. "
"8497630","8503410"," There's like a, it's weird because like I am woke, but I don't want it to be punched in the"
"8503410","8504090"," face with it."
"8504270","8505610"," It's, it's kind of fucked up."
"8506250","8510930"," The hard topic to discuss because you can come off as not being on the side of this. "
"8512270","8513790"," It's just bad writing."
"8514310","8516690"," Normally, that's what I see it as just bad fucking writing."
"8522910","8525510"," Mass Supreme Apple working over everybody. "
"8525610","8525970"," Fun facts."
"8526170","8527130"," It's a little Disney property."
"8527350","8528970"," They have to provide an easement through the parking lot. "
"8529030","8529530"," I believe that."
"8533360","8535160"," We're going to get out because it's high."
"8535460","8535740"," Good dates. "
"8535940","8537000"," They cap needs to be organic."
"8537000","8538420"," Like anything else sucks where it isn't."
"8538840","8539680"," Our narrative. "
"8539920","8540040"," Same."
"8540260","8542000"," I don't like when a film gets too preachy."
"8542100","8543280"," It has to make sense in the film. "
"8544060","8544420"," It's artificial."
"8544780","8546320"," It's always shittier than what it's not."
"8546500","8546840"," Absolutely. "
"8547300","8548080"," You know, it's funny."
"8548240","8548700"," I just watched."
"8549840","8551200"," You know, it's bizarre too. "
"8551200","8552500"," Because even my kids see it."
"8553160","8559320"," And you know, it's fucked up as I just watched everything everywhere all at once."
"8560420","8562720"," And it couldn't be a more diverse cast. "
"8563060","8564860"," Couldn't be a more diverse concept."
"8565960","8570740"," And I never at one at any point was it never broke the fifth wall for me."
"8571280","8573920"," I was never pulled out of the movie. "
"8574400","8577040"," And it hit everything right on the head."
"8578800","8581700"," It hit every every every note for me."
"8582180","8584160"," And so I think it definitely is. "
"8585980","8590120"," How you get a message across or there's no intent of getting a message across."
"8590160","8591180"," It just happens."
"8605840","8607160"," Yeah, I didn't look at CRC. "
"8608180","8609280"," I'm getting too many."
"8609660","8610980"," I'm reading the chat right now."
"8611020","8613720"," They're just crazy ticker shout outs right now. "
"8614260","8617700"," Like I probably have had 40 or 50 at this point."
"8617980","8618400"," I couldn't get."
"8618500","8620100"," I don't think I tried them out in a day. "
"8621000","8621880"," I apologize."
"8628270","8630110"," Dezone's power company with parks and surrounding."
"8630330","8630690"," I do. "
"8630810","8634850"," I'm going to tell you, I have a family friend who owns property and they're in a."
"8635110","8637930"," They're in like a lease agreement with Disney."
"8638710","8641790"," That's like for like 200 years or something insane."
"8641830","8643590"," I probably shouldn't be talking about this. "
"8644710","8646090"," But they like back."
"8646230","8648730"," I want to say this is back in the 50s and 70s."
"8649750","8651890"," Disney like cleaned up everything like. "
"8652270","8653450"," And you wouldn't even know it."
"8653450","8654930"," Like if you're like a mile away from Disney."
"8655490","8659710"," They either own that land that they lease to specific companies. "
"8659710","8660870"," So it has a certain look."
"8661630","8664810"," Or they're in an agreement with the owner of that land."
"8665550","8668810"," For for many, many, many, many, many decades and years. "
"8679440","8681240"," So I disagree with that."
"8681400","8681680"," The writing."
"8681960","8683920"," It's all boiler plate and they just fill in the blanks. "
"8684260","8686300"," So you know who did a good discussion on this was."
"8689460","8691700"," G.R. Martin did a great discussion on this."
"8692400","8692840"," Recently. "
"8693420","8694320"," He talks about."
"8694940","8697120"," I don't know where the discussion is right now."
"8697140","8698840"," I'm not going to go search for where you can find it. "
"8699280","8700740"," He does a great discussion on."
"8702280","8703380"," There used to be."
"8704240","8705580"," Up until recently. "
"8705580","8707340"," About 10 years ago, 15 years ago."
"8707980","8709360"," There used to be writers rooms."
"8710440","8711300"," So you get a script. "
"8712100","8712880"," If it was approved."
"8714520","8716000"," You had different level of writers."
"8716200","8721120"," You had young writers with older writers and they would spend time together. "
"8721600","8722820"," Working on script writing."
"8723700","8724560"," Script development."
"8725620","8732620"," And so you'd get like four or five staff writers or writers with credit on the screen. "
"8732620","8736840"," And then you have like a room full of new writers and."
"8737320","8741740"," You had some kind of a system of a system of almost a."
"8743140","8746160"," Mentorship and how to write for TV or movies."
"8746840","8750880"," Now he did a big discussion where he said that's gone out the window at this point. "
"8751200","8752440"," There's no more of that."
"8753500","8755840"," So yeah, maybe we're at that boiler plate phone."
"8755980","8757980"," The blanks kind of a time with writers. "
"8757980","8760180"," Maybe I know there are people on this stream."
"8760180","8762840"," I'm not going to call you out unless you want to say something."
"8763040","8767500"," But I know we have actors, professional actors, directors in this stream right now. "
"8767760","8770100"," They might be able to confirm or deny that's happening."
"8770940","8773560"," But what I was told was that."
"8774420","8778800"," That the structure of house shows and movies are written have changed significantly. "
"8796330","8798610"," Yeah, you know, see, this is that argument."
"8798950","8799150"," The question."
"8799450","8800490"," So I just read a statement. "
"8800690","8803190"," It says, except white culture is written as white entertainment."
"8803730","8807970"," Just because there is a minority character doesn't mean it's automatically poorly written."
"8809790","8813150"," I got to tell you, man, a lot of like there's a lot of like. "
"8815110","8816150"," I'm from Detroit."
"8816670","8818530"," I'm a minority where I live."
"8819270","8821450"," And most of my friends here. "
"8822610","8826010"," Are not like white middle class male like myself, right?"
"8826930","8828710"," And they like characters to be written."
"8831330","8834170"," Like they can tell my friends can tell when."
"8834850","8839310"," There's like bullshit writing and bullshit movies that are just doing lip service versus. "
"8839310","8842790"," Hey, I'm writing this because this person's a hero or whatever."
"8843750","8845250"," You know, people aren't fucking dumb."
"8845450","8850250"," They want to be, you know, if you're going to write me as Superman, write me as fucking Superman. "
"8850630","8851050"," You know what I mean?"
"8852430","8854430"," You want to be treated with respect, right?"
"8854870","8856770"," You're human being the same level."
"8857190","8858070"," We're all humans."
"8858530","8860030"," And that's not really happening sometimes. "
"8874140","8876100"," Yeah, I am pretty woke."
"8876240","8878060"," I think I'm looking pretty, pretty Democrat, man."
"8878060","8879300"," I'm a Democrat. "
"8890980","8891820"," Everybody's making moves."
"8892260","8893380"," Somebody's still long here."
"8893480","8894140"," Yeah, I'm long right now. "
"8897560","8899760"," You can definitely notice a lack of original ideas."
"8899760","8901460"," Movie saw remakes and sequels now."
"8901660","8902380"," You know, the thing that's. "
"8903020","8905180"," The thing that's tough for me is that."
"8906980","8910780"," That I'm I'm an efficient out of movies and TV of film."
"8910780","8913640"," I like have a large library of movies. "
"8914440","8916780"," Thousands of titles, to be honest with you."
"8918160","8919840"," I don't talk about it often, but."
"8921100","8923520"," The one thing that really bums me out is. "
"8924980","8928740"," Or that bums me out right now is that we're getting two tests right now."
"8928980","8930100"," It's looking kind of bearish here."
"8930640","8933920"," I don't like seeing this right now, so we'll see if we're getting a role here. "
"8934320","8937540"," Whenever you see this, start to see this stuff down here."
"8937640","8938640"," I'm like, you better get a move."
"8938760","8940060"," No movie could roll down. "
"8940980","8945920"," You know, think about movies and TV that kind of is sad to me right now."
"8946120","8946580"," To some extent."
"8947780","8950740"," And you know, you can't get a discussion about this. "
"8950880","8952320"," A true discussion about it on."
"8952900","8955040"," Like our movies on Reddit."
"8955700","8958300"," A lot like as an example, Reddit is filled. "
"8958640","8962700"," Like the our movies subreddit on on Reddit is filled with industry work."
"8963940","8968420"," Participants, so they're not going to discuss with you the state of entertainment."
"8969170","8971800"," As a matter of fact, I just watched last night. "
"8972240","8974980"," I watched red letter media discussing this topic."
"8974980","8977120"," That's a taboo topic topic to discuss."
"8978020","8978960"," And that is. "
"8980130","8981860"," That is the state of entertainment."
"8982760","8986820"," And no one wants to talk about the boogie man in the corner."
"8987420","8988920"," Nobody wants to discuss it. "
"8990600","8997080"," And that is that entertainment tastes are changing significantly."
"8997820","9000160"," And we may not see it being older."
"9000840","9003060"," And no one wants to discuss the. "
"9005080","9008600"," You know, what what is possibly happening to entertainment in general."
"9010220","9013940"," And that's what it's multi fold, but you got to look at kids."
"9014440","9016640"," So my kids, when they watch a movie. "
"9018700","9022520"," It's fascinating to watch how they watch a movie."
"9023180","9025920"," And what entertains them for movies."
"9026500","9028060"," They have very short attention spans. "
"9028740","9031400"," If anyone's talking, they stop paying attention."
"9032320","9035640"," And they only only like repeat attention again."
"9035640","9038800"," Once there's like something fantastical happening. "
"9039440","9041600"," They care way less about plot."
"9042160","9044180"," They care way less about what's going on."
"9044760","9047780"," And it's like tune in to tune in to tune out. "
"9048560","9050420"," And they don't have."
"9052260","9053180"," They don't have it."
"9053280","9054480"," So they're all the attention span. "
"9054900","9055360"," And then."
"9056400","9057980"," They're very fascinated in."
"9058640","9060280"," An entertainment that. "
"9061660","9065320"," Is something that they know are familiar with."
"9067580","9070040"," And if it's not, they take no interest."
"9070660","9072440"," And I have my kids read classic books. "
"9072780","9074540"," We have them on this."
"9076080","9078220"," Liberal arts education path right now."
"9078420","9079220"," Pretty, pretty heavily. "
"9080020","9083360"," But I'll tell you what, man, like there's a writing on the wall where."
"9085800","9087440"," Entertainment tastes are changing."
"9088040","9090920"," There's also writing on the wall where the talent. "
"9092380","9095000"," For these productions are going elsewhere."
"9095680","9096980"," They're off doing their own thing."
"9097180","9098880"," They're off doing shit on YouTube. "
"9099300","9101020"," They're off doing shit on TikTok and."
"9101020","9104520"," Switch and you might find natural talent."
"9105740","9109460"," Like you're naturally good a Hollywood and become talent for Hollywood. "
"9110160","9111360"," Or New York City."
"9111740","9113280"," That's not as quite what it used to be."
"9113660","9115580"," There's another weird thing going on to where. "
"9116020","9118740"," If you look at, if you look at above the line people."
"9119920","9121560"," They're not real people anymore."
"9121840","9123600"," A lot of them are Hollywood elite. "
"9123960","9125020"," They're like sons and daughters."
"9125800","9128800"," Of previous producers, directors, movie stars."
"9128800","9130900"," Or they're classically trained. "
"9131240","9133720"," If you go to if you go to a lot of movies made today."
"9134040","9136020"," And you look at the pedigree."
"9136700","9140160"," Of actors and anyone above the line, right?"
"9140500","9142520"," A lot of these people come from. "
"9143160","9145160"," Two backgrounds, either."
"9146440","9149660"," A great school background or they come from."
"9150500","9151700"," They come from. "
"9153280","9155240"," Family, to be honest with you."
"9156860","9158660"," Movies and televisions are one time."
"9158840","9161740"," You could just be someone with that thing that nobody has, right?"
"9161980","9162700"," And you'd get the job. "
"9163140","9164780"," You see it in music sometimes too."
"9166460","9171860"," Actually you can see it in music often times where people look a certain way and sound a certain"
"9171860","9172280"," way."
"9173800","9180600"," Not a lot of natural, like natural talent or ability or they have that thing. "
"9184160","9188440"," So the writing in the wall for me though is definitely the younger, younger people."
"9188620","9189480"," It's really scared me."
"9191040","9193680"," The change in entertainment consumption. "
"9194320","9196800"," I'm afraid of the death of movies and TV's."
"9197060","9201800"," Our TV shows and the golden age of TV are ever having a golden age of TV."
"9202040","9203120"," I always hope that we would. "
"9203700","9211520"," I wanted to see that mix of practical effects and CGI take off like that blend."
"9211520","9212420"," That beautiful blend."
"9213660","9217620"," I'm afraid that the age of movies might be over in general. "
"9226860","9228720"," Am I a Kennedy Democrat?"
"9229280","9232740"," I don't know if I would be a Kennedy Democrat."
"9232900","9235780"," Sometimes I call myself an LBJ Democrat to some extent."
"9237100","9238200"," I think of myself as that. "
"9244140","9251520"," Yeah, I think about 2000 from what I can see from my own collections of movies and TV shows."
"9252260","9261820"," There was a stark right around 2016 is when you can see a market difference in"
"9261820","9264240"," trying to stay profitable."
"9264540","9270220"," It's shitty to say this, but I think you can see right around 2016. "
"9273000","9275040"," A total, not a total like a."
"9276680","9280720"," Hey, we have to make money and this is what we're going to do to make money."
"9281000","9283560"," And so we're going to, we're going to, you know, we have to try to stay profitable."
"9284320","9288640"," I think to right around 2016 might have started slightly before 2014. "
"9289560","9294480"," But you saw the market shift right around 2016 to today and people like to assign it to being woke."
"9294800","9295360"," I don't believe that."
"9295640","9296920"," I think it's all about money. "
"9296920","9301900"," I think at the end of the day, in the background, it's always about fucking money, man."
"9302200","9303200"," It always is."
"9305500","9306760"," Smooth, squeeze and hire. "
"9307140","9308220"," Now reversing right now."
"9309600","9311140"," It's always about money."
"9316730","9318390"," And there's also taste. "
"9318650","9319510"," I shouldn't say always moment."
"9319690","9321450"," It's always about money, but it's also about format."
"9322370","9326630"," You know, we don't have, like we have instant access to movies now, right?"
"9326630","9330190"," And TV shows, what we demand that we see them whenever we want. "
"9331190","9333270"," We don't have physical media anymore."
"9333730","9336390"," So we've got all those issues to contend with as well."
"9337730","9341550"," And then we've got a stark change in consumption habits of kids. "
"9342230","9344510"," That's the, that's the one, that's the boogie man."
"9344610","9346930"," That's the one where it's like no one wants to talk about that."
"9347590","9350150"," Is what will these kids want to consume?"
"9350910","9353210"," Will they want to sit through a two hour movie?"
"9353530","9354170"," That's all dialogue. "
"9355710","9357430"," Oppenheimer's a great example of that, right?"
"9358450","9361190"," A perfect example of changing tastes."
"9369800","9371200"," A perfect example of that."
"9371960","9375160"," I don't know what you guys think of the state of movies and TV. "
"9378480","9382380"," I find that I'm collecting less than I ever was in the past."
"9385700","9390300"," I'm collecting less, I'm collecting less where I'm like, yeah, I need to own that movie forever."
"9391200","9393340"," Or I need to own that TV show forever. "
"9399760","9401120"," Yeah, games have too."
"9401300","9406560"," I haven't been involved in gaming as I once was, so I can't attest to that right now."
"9406640","9408040"," I stopped gaming years ago. "
"9408660","9410640"," Maybe you can say something about gaming as well."
"9418270","9420150"," Yeah, the good stories are hard to come by."
"9420370","9420890"," They really are. "
"9421350","9422430"," It's sad to see."
"9424190","9433750"," Trust me, I have, I think recently, I had a real sad, actually was sad."
"9433950","9439050"," I was thinking about it that we may never come back to that again. "
"9439270","9443730"," We may be gone forever and be really sad if that was the case."
"9458000","9459760"," Yeah, Marvel is the same way, man."
"9460260","9461640"," Lots of 10 polls, right?"
"9461880","9462680"," Big 10 poll movies. "
"9463140","9463740"," It's an experience."
"9464940","9466660"," And even then, it's not even the best experience."
"9466900","9468200"," I'm kind of frustrated with that too. "
"9469360","9475000"," Like, I don't mind, I like the 10 poll movies, but even the 10 poll movies, there's no sense."
"9475400","9477380"," They're breaking the fifth wall for me all the time."
"9477820","9481060"," Like, I can't stay immersed in the film. "
"9482780","9484100"," Like, they're blowing up New York."
"9484360","9485900"," Same, like, same."
"9486120","9488080"," It'd be like, okay, it's very smart. "
"9488280","9489480"," We're going to blow up another city."
"9489660","9492020"," I'm like, I was talking to my kids recently about it."
"9492120","9496320"," I was like, can you imagine all these, the whole, the earth would be bankrupt at this point. "
"9498480","9500680"," Like, like everyone would have PTSD."
"9503140","9506240"," Like, earth would be like an apocalypse."
"9506240","9511780"," If all, if all, all the stuff that happens in these movies would actually have taken place. "
"9515060","9517460"," All quiet in the Western Front, not a fan."
"9518460","9519180"," Read the book."
"9520120","9522860"," Watch the two versions of it prior to the new release. "
"9523560","9524340"," Not a fan of the new version."
"9533990","9535630"," Elden Ring, I've heard good things about it."
"9543750","9546770"," The only thing that matters to me is future Emma is back on Hulu. "
"9548090","9551370"," Gaming has been raped by microtransactions."
"9552310","9553150"," You don't play anymore."
"9553750","9554190"," It's skills. "
"9554510","9558330"," You know, it's so bear town chef saying gaming has been raped by microtransactions."
"9558430","9559490"," Play more."
"9559830","9563610"," Dude, I should show you the, you know what?"
"9563690","9565270"," I should ask my wife to print out. "
"9565270","9571730"," My kids spend stupid money on microtransactions."
"9571730","9572470"," It's disgusting."
"9573470","9574470"," How much they actually spend?"
"9580170","9585570"," Yeah, the CGI, I wish there was more of a blend of, I wish there was more of a blend"
"9585570","9589750"," of real props and CGI. "
"9590710","9596290"," There's like that blend where it feels, feels real and then where it doesn't, and it sucks."
"9596290","9598190"," It's sad to see that go."
"9598530","9600110"," Aliens, another good film based. "
"9600550","9605690"," So an alien, the original alien, they went to a bone yard for planes."
"9606630","9609790"," Bombers and they pulled a bunch of shit out and they rebuilt."
"9610390","9612890"," Was it Nostromas or Nostromas or something like that?"
"9613490","9616190"," Out of all these old plane parts. "
"9617130","9618510"," And you just like that feel."
"9620570","9621530"," It's unmistakable."
"9621870","9623930"," You don't do, I always bring do not as an example. "
"9623930","9625470"," It's too clean."
"9626010","9630030"," The sand is too clean."
"9630550","9631870"," Everything was too clean about it. "
"9632530","9635250"," Even the clothing was too clean."
"9636050","9639810"," You could see that it was like, it was just too fucking clean."
"9640650","9641390"," It's not real life. "
"9641770","9644290"," So it pulls me out of the movie experience."
"9655150","9661910"," Yeah, I didn't like, I didn't like all quiet in the western fronts because it didn't capture for me"
"9661910","9664590"," the true horror of war."
"9665610","9667430"," They missed out on a great opportunity. "
"9676580","9678420"," Yeah, Pixar is another big one, right?"
"9678620","9679440"," Pixar has gone downhill."
"9685420","9686340"," It's too sober."
"9687120","9689680"," I like that answer. "
"9692020","9692880"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"9692940","9693780"," Endgame was done, right?"
"9694000","9695040"," Endgame for me was done as well."
"9696840","9702240"," Oh dude, Winky, you know what, Winky, I still have not watched John Wick, but I did get it. "
"9702500","9703100"," So I have it."
"9703460","9704580"," It's on the short list."
"9704780","9707880"," It's like, it's like in the top 10 of what I haven't finished yet. "
"9709060","9717040"," I just watched CSU and I watched, oh, I watched this really fucking hilarious one."
"9717040","9720420"," They cloned Leroy or some shit like that."
"9720420","9721840"," That movie was fucking great. "
"9722560","9723620"," I watched that one."
"9723640","9724700"," That was a great flick."
"9725620","9727880"," They cloned Leroy or something like that. "
"9745950","9747370"," Have you ever been to a rakus?"
"9749410","9754010"," I actually like the first dude that I like the first dude more than I like this one."
"9756310","9757990"," And the first dude was terrible."
"9760090","9764850"," And I still like the first dude more than I like this version of Dune. "
"9765910","9775430"," And they're like, for how bad the first one was, this one's missing the overshot it."
"9777130","9780360"," I did."
"9780520","9781700"," So, Winky, I will tell you this. "
"9781840","9783580"," I tried to watch John Wick too."
"9784880","9788420"," A few weeks ago, I tried to get through it and I fucking couldn't."
"9789020","9793060"," I was like, that part two sucks. "
"9794680","9795800"," They cloned Tyrone."
"9796420","9797720"," That was a great fucking movie."
"9817730","9818950"," Yeah, Clash of the Titans. "
"9819470","9822310"," I recently re-watched the new version."
"9823250","9824570"," It doesn't hold the candle of the first one."
"9825330","9827090"," It does not hold the candle to it. "
"9827550","9830750"," And I was offended by them doing away with the bird and all that shit."
"9830930","9831690"," That pissed me off too."
"9831690","9832750"," Oh, the owl. "
"9834530","9840410"," Yeah, I watched that movie."
"9840750","9843210"," I watched that documentary about Dune."
"9843390","9846730"," I watched that one. "
"9847990","9848550"," Maverick."
"9848770","9850210"," I haven't seen that in a long time."
"9852830","9854470"," Avatar 2 couldn't get through it. "
"9854750","9858030"," I wanted to fucking choke myself out watching that movie."
"9858710","9859030"," It's terrible."
"9859670","9860570"," It's really bad. "
"9865510","9869870"," Avatar 2 is like, I'm rich and I do whatever I want."
"9872790","9881830"," As a matter of fact, Avatar 2, it reminds me of last night, I went on to the Sotheby's auction"
"9881830","9887290"," house website and they were auctioning off some properties on Martha's Vineyard."
"9887290","9891310"," And they had a section called Timberland. "
"9892250","9894430"," Timberland for auction or for sale."
"9894670","9895230"," Either one."
"9895490","9896990"," This is the actual Sotheby's. "
"9897670","9898610"," And I'm like, man."
"9898970","9901670"," I was like, that's fuck you money to be buying that shit."
"9901850","9905170"," So I went on to that website and I'm looking at the Timberland for sale. "
"9905910","9907390"," And there were no prices."
"9907630","9909530"," You had to sign a non-disclosure."
"9910290","9917810"," But these were like tracks that were like 20,000 acres of prime virgin forest in the And I was"
"9917810","9921530"," like, I was like, you got to be fucking, you got to have fucking money to buy that stuff. "
"9922090","9928670"," Like, I'm over here talking about buying, I'm over here talking about buying storage facilities."
"9929410","9936350"," And there's some other asshole out there going, I'm going to invest in Timberland for my great,"
"9936350","9937290"," great, great grandchildren."
"9938270","9941090"," And I was trying to guess how much those properties cost. "
"9945090","9946490"," Yeah, it was Jordowski."
"9946790","9947190"," Is it Jared?"
"9947310","9947790"," Is it Jared?"
"9948130","9949170"," I think it's Jared."
"9949370","9950350"," Jared is his name. "
"9956900","9959280"," I didn't, yeah, I'm surprised you have to auto sub."
"9963200","9968240"," So I saw where I put Ant-Man Ant-Man on the other day."
"9968860","9971040"," And I walked away from it, kids kept watching it. "
"9971940","9974580"," And then I saw Guardian's three."
"9975260","9977300"," There's like two or three movies in that movie."
"9978480","9979340"," There's too much. "
"9981920","9985080"," That's probably the best thing about Marvel too is Guardians of the Galaxy."
"9985600","9988380"," I didn't like Guardians 2 that much."
"9989080","9990980"," Nothing holds the count of the Guardians 1."
"9991840","9993700"," Guardians 3 had too much going on. "
"9997620","10002080"," You know, it's funny, saving Private Ryan as a great flick."
"10002960","10007160"," I've come to appreciate now being a veteran."
"10007300","10009480"," I come to appreciate the thin red line. "
"10013160","10019460"," There are some, there's some things about the military that people, I don't find often talk about."
"10019820","10025980"," They often talk about the Brotherhood of War, but there's a lot about the army for me, where I"
"10025980","10026680"," didn't quite."
"10027640","10029620"," It was closer to the thin red line. "
"10029720","10030760"," I don't want to say it publicly, but."
"10032720","10037780"," There were a lot of people in the military that I was like, I wouldn't fucking fall that guy"
"10037780","10038100"," anywhere."
"10042040","10043900"," That's all in the conversation. "
"10048550","10050370"," Dunkirk in 1917."
"10051770","10053970"," Dunkirk, it was okay."
"10055510","10061250"," I have mixed feelings about Dunkirk. "
"10065660","10067000"," 1917 was pretty good."
"10067880","10068880"," That was pretty good."
"10069200","10069900"," Pretty well done. "
"10074060","10075580"," Maverick is the top gun sequel."
"10075800","10076640"," I did watch that one."
"10078480","10080560"," I was thinking you were talking about Maverick. "
"10081960","10083840"," The Maverick guy, that was a cowboy."
"10085040","10090380"," It was like an old film from the early 2000s, maybe, or late 1990s."
"10092140","10096900"," James, something or other was the actor, and that one, an older actor, was starting that film. "
"10097680","10101260"," He was like a sheriff or something like that, or poker player or something like that."
"10110660","10113500"," What was the, hold on a second, I get rid of some calls."
"10122440","10124780"," So, if you like, hold on a second here. "
"10126660","10134780"," I got something in my eyes here."
"10136460","10145500"," If you like John Wick, I like gun fu."
"10146420","10151940"," You guys probably know what that is, but I like it out of like Hong Kong films, Hong Kong cinema,"
"10152720","10162720"," and then, and like, what I, I"
"10162720","10164780"," got to take some off here, hold on. "
"10166500","10172220"," All right, fuck that, I'm out."
"10173600","10174900"," That was fucking forever."
"10175540","10176820"," That was nonsense right there. "

"11577430","11582290"," twenty seven and believe it one twenty nine sixty six."
"11583830","11587090"," So I'm actually very bullish here in Google over Microsoft. "
"11587750","11596090"," So I'm going to be fascinated to see if I think Microsoft goes down in their earnings and I think"
"11596090","11596890"," Google goes up."
"11597870","11604250"," What I really like about Google here too is that it has it's at the bottom of its daily right"
"11604250","11604510"," here."
"11605250","11607870"," It's done pretty good pretty good. "

"12953670","12956710"," Do you think we begin to sell into. "
"12958550","12959230"," The."

"13531310","13534490"," I've got a four sixty twenty eight on Friday."
"13534710","13536530"," The entire move is like right now. "
"13538490","13542930"," There isn't a whole hell of a lot of this looks like it's going to be a big one."
"13545290","13548710"," It looks like the entire move is expected tomorrow."
"13549530","13550910"," The way the options market is. "
"13551550","13554830"," The way the options market is it is right now."
"13554990","13555670"," There's no like."
"13557430","13559090"," The options market looks like this. "
"13559550","13561470"," So if this is tomorrow."
"13561470","13566910"," And this is today and this was yesterday right."
"13573010","13574510"," It's kind of like this. "

"13601100","13604740"," So big expansion today larger expansion tomorrow. "
"13606000","13608560"," And then and then fucking flat sideways."
"13611520","13616260"," So I'm going to assume that you'll see."
"13617260","13619760"," Either expansion of the upside or downside. "
"13627860","13629360"," If you want to look at Google."
"13630420","13631720"," I did chart it out."
"13632340","13634180"," So if you want to take a snapshot of it you can. "
"13636060","13636880"," Hold on a second here."
"13636920","13637680"," I'm going to reset everything."
"13638520","13639500"," One quick second here. "
"13645140","13646360"," Now why is it not showing up?"
"13653880","13655560"," Why is that not showing up?"
"13656800","13658360"," I think tight air for a minute guys."
"13659420","13660840"," If you want to see Google."
"13669320","13671460"," So this is Google right here. "
"13671760","13672920"," If you want to look at this one here."
"13674880","13682600"," We already had some upside targets on Google of 125, 126, 127, 129."
"13684460","13686540"," So we hit our first target. "
"13687120","13688720"," Hit this target already."
"13690180","13691200"," Came back down to consolidate."
"13691600","13693680"," Next target for Google 129, 66. "
"13695640","13699900"," The expected move though is 127.41. Expected move to the downside."
"13700440","13701560"," 116 down here."
"13702040","13703040"," This is your weekly trigger. "
"13703280","13704260"," This is your monthly trigger."
"13708680","13709980"," Harley trigger down here."
"13710180","13711100"," Daily trigger down here. "
"13711320","13715300"," There's a gap down below of either of these tickers."
"13715620","13717920"," The best looking one to me is Google."
"13718760","13721540"," And the. "
"13725850","13727710"," Yes, I guess what we'll do is."
"13728410","13729290"," One here."
"13744850","13749270"," So to me, so we looked at three, three major charts today. "
"13749770","13750970"," Google snap."
"13752270","13754390"," And Microsoft Microsoft."
"13755050","13756570"," Yeah, I'm not really a fan. "
"13756810","13757530"," There's like a ton."
"13758670","13761450"," Of big money in Microsoft."
"13761450","13762810"," I'm trying to look for like. "
"13764050","13769370"," Something that maybe isn't priced in or has a large and outsized move expected."
"13771290","13772990"," Snap has a little outside move."
"13773410","13774110"," Move expected. "
"13775170","13776990"," I like far like a two or three."
"13777130","13778590"," I think it was April 18 or August."
"13779230","13782150"," Excuse me, 18 calls and puts seem kind of nice. "
"13784030","13784670"," And."
"13787870","13792110"," I like Google's chart better than I like Microsoft's chart."
"13794850","13797670"," I am interested in in training. "
"13799570","13802490"," Use or spy after the bell."
"13805010","13809410"," I always like, you know, like that first quick drop down on one of these ticker."
"13809510","13810630"," Matter of fact, two years ago. "
"13810630","13813730"," I was trading Microsoft."
"13817510","13821610"," And we traded at live stream, I think, and Microsoft."
"13823150","13827090"," They like the report came in looking really bad. "
"13827950","13830490"," And so like spy plunge to the depths of hell."
"13831130","13833470"," And then we saw that the report was good."
"13835190","13840230"," So they like they changed the report or something like that or the news report and it fucking"
"13840230","13841030"," mooned. "
"13842430","13847330"," And we made I think I made like a three or four hundred percent trade that day."
"13848610","13850410"," And like 15 minutes or something."
"13850690","13851230"," It was insane. "
"13851590","13853050"," It was it was you guys remember that trade?"
"13853610","13854630"," It's like three or four hundred percent."
"13855350","13855990"," Something like that."
"13856670","13858510"," You guys remember that member that Microsoft trade?"
"13858650","13861270"," It was a couple years ago. "
"13868970","13872730"," Microsoft looks like looks like Colin put solar heaven."
"13874470","13883060"," I think they're just going to get to talk to the producer."
"14068470","14070830"," Sorry, I'm talking about producer real quick. "
"14086390","14091850"," Yes, like winky the calls to four sixty eight doesn't mean we go there, right?"
"14091990","14093370"," It's just the call wall gets raised."
"14094390","14096230"," It's always like 10 points lower."
"14103210","14105690"," Be kind of has one beer planer rings. "
"14111010","14112950"," Did you winky?"
"14113170","14114710"," Did you read the text that just sent you?"
"14167860","14218450"," The actual"
"14218450","14221030"," big volume falls off at four sixty five thursday."
"14221930","14222730"," You got it?"
"14222850","14223110"," Okay, good."
"14228960","14233480"," Yeah, if you got so Jimmy what you need is people to buy four eighties, right?"
"14233880","14239120"," Not just four sixty eights or what winky just said that those calls fall off in the Friday. "
"14239120","14245800"," You need like you need people to buy four seventy four eighty for us to go there."
"14246360","14249940"," There needs to be like a hundred points higher for every level."
"14250200","14256340"," Like every time you raise a call wall, you need to have belief that like so yesterday in a"
"14256340","14263080"," conversation I was having with you yesterday about how sentiment is important. "
"14263080","14265200"," Sentiment means a lot."
"14266460","14275060"," By market participants means a lot by banks means a lot by everyone involved in every layer."
"14275640","14281280"," It doesn't start with sentiment, but it does result in sentiment. "
"14282440","14285120"," Like the end result of sentiment is important."
"14290340","14292460"," So yesterday we had a discussion about."
"14294700","14297690"," No one no one liked that argument I made yesterday about. "
"14301180","14307560"," The Fed needs to trick Bob on Main Street to think that he can sell his house."
"14308520","14315760"," And take the pain on rate increases with an expected rate cut down the road."
"14321830","14323890"," So like, hey, I can I can take those rates. "
"14324870","14326250"," Let me just imagine that."
"14329510","14331670"," You're like a real estate agent out there."
"14331690","14335130"," You're just looking for the Fed to come out and be like, yeah, we're getting a pause. "
"14336190","14337930"," Twenty five BPS were done."
"14340390","14341590"," Party fucking on."
"14343050","14346750"," You got real estate agents going through their Rolodex calling all these mother. "
"14346750","14350390"," They should be swearing calling all these people out there."
"14351290","14355990"," They have them and sitting on their house to get like some realtors like we're going to restart"
"14355990","14356730"," that campaign."
"14357950","14360850"," Start knocking on doors and getting people to sell their houses. "
"14361570","14362690"," I can just see it right now."
"14367150","14370070"," If I was a realtor and you got a dumbish Fed."
"14370970","14373970"," I guarantee you there's going to be some asshole. "
"14375750","14378870"," Is he be like, I want, I want all you guys are doing nothing in the office."
"14379270","14381190"," I want you to go door to door in this neighborhood."
"14381510","14382750"," None of these people have sold. "
"14383250","14386830"," I want you to tell them about how rates are going to be down by winter."
"14390610","14394310"," They can come out from underneath their rock and they should put their house on the market and buy"
"14394310","14394930"," something else."
"14396770","14398610"," And say like they're banging on doors. "
"14400190","14404810"," In like Bob and Mary are like, oh, we've had this house since 2016."
"14406210","14407750"," We're ready for the next step up."
"14407910","14410130"," We were afraid we didn't want to get hammered by rates. "
"14411430","14412450"," And that realtor is like."
"14414910","14419490"," Our man Jerome told us don't worry about it yesterday."
"14423250","14424710"," Seven percent is the top. "
"14425430","14426990"," You can expect rate cuts by winter."
"14430810","14433070"," Like Mary and Bob are like, oh, we love that guy."
"14433350","14434230"," Jerome is the man. "
"14434990","14436130"," He's looking out for us."
"14436910","14438430"," Let's put the house for sale, honey."
"14438610","14442190"," We can absorb a year and a half or six months of seven percent. "
"14452680","14453420"," And so."
"14456580","14459260"," This is very much like buying calls at 480."
"14462180","14466260"," You need people to think that we're going to 480 on this next Fed meeting. "
"14466260","14469840"," Even if they buy those 480 C's for like December."
"14472500","14477060"," You need people to believe we're going there for the markets actually trade 470."
"14478380","14481760"," And we need more 470 buyers for us to trade 460. "
"14483220","14485260"," It doesn't matter if we go there or not."
"14485900","14489000"," You just need the expansion of calls to that upside."
"14494900","14496520"," It'd be fucking awesome though. "
"14496660","14505510"," Look at that perfect tag down here on a retest of a 27 EMA in the five minute."
"14508410","14514450"," So you get like Jerome's out there and he's like, yeah, we're going to loosen up the housing"
"14514450","14514870"," market."
"14515870","14521170"," All these people are partying buying their fucking houses at seven points, eight points. "
"14530710","14533070"," Well, yeah, if you don't think you've seen stupid people."
"14533830","14535770"," Let me introduce you to 2008."
"14538690","14541170"," If you get them thinking they can do it, they'll do it. "
"14542510","14544150"," You fucking give them a ninja loan."
"14544950","14548750"," They'll be like, hell yeah, what do I sign?"
"14556320","14558300"," What do you mean after the brother proved my income?"
"14558840","14560200"," Well, I make a million dollars a year."
"14561060","14562940"," I can take a balloon mortgage, right?"
"14563760","14564860"," It's cheaper than renting. "
"14565200","14565780"," Who do I care?"
"14566540","14567720"," I'll sell it or foreclose."
"14572080","14577120"," Jerome could bark and people would believe him and they'd start buying like mad, mad men women."
"14577460","14578920"," Trust me, who would care?"
"14584410","14586590"," Yeah, I'm kind of on the more data. "
"14589570","14591690"," My, my own take is that."
"14600060","14601700"," Okay, so a poll is going on."
"14601880","14603940"," Do we need, do we have to do the rate decision?"
"14605860","14607300"," Use vote yes or no. "
"14607700","14610640"," I'm going to go with no."
"14615040","14617560"," I fucking think they're going to front run this shit."
"14624770","14626410"," Let me see if I do this right or not. "
"14626830","14627690"," I'm going to go with no."
"14629930","14631070"," I voted no."
"14631270","14632590"," I think they're going to front run this shit. "
"14632650","14633450"," It's going to be gnarly."
"14635810","14642860"," I think they're fucking pigs."
"14644760","14649900"," I think they're pigs. "
"14650260","14650500"," I do."
"14650660","14651980"," I think they're disgusting pigs."
"14654540","14657820"," I think if I was a hedge fund, that would be caught dead. "
"14659740","14660220"," Short."
"14661180","14662920"," This rate decision tomorrow."
"14665740","14669020"," It'd be either be sitting on my hands or I'd be long. "
"14671440","14672360"," That's what I think."
"14674740","14677280"," No, that's of course, that's, that's what I think."
"14677640","14680760"," So don't base your trade on what I think. "
"14681400","14683840"," I think they're out of their fucking minds."
"14688180","14690820"," So I'm going to go with no, but that's my sentiment."
"14692780","14697300"," There's something about this where like if the Roman any point, like if he pauses. "
"14699880","14702000"," I haven't seen anything of Timorose yet."
"14702120","14703760"," Has anybody seen anything Timorose come out yet?"
"14704060","14707820"," Like so Timorose last rate decision made some very fair point."
"14708000","14712900"," He was like, look, they're not going to pause at this meeting. "
"14713840","14715280"," It would be unexpected."
"14717120","14722100"," But it would be expected at the next rate hike for them to officially pause."
"14723440","14726380"," So that Jimmy's talking about the data dependent, right?"
"14726960","14728400"," That was the last rate decision. "
"14729360","14732860"," I do think you get your 25 BPS."
"14733700","14738440"," I am fascinated by if he uses that language."
"14739300","14740920"," Not in the presser. "
"14742540","14745480"," I'm fascinated by it in the press release."
"14746160","14752100"," If the press release does not mention data dependent in any kind of way she performed, just we're"
"14752100","14752560"," pausing."
"14753300","14756040"," I think this has the potential explode. "
"14757900","14758860"," To the upside."
"14759400","14762240"," Now, is that going to be something that can hold?"
"14763080","14763620"," Probably not."
"14765420","14766540"," Probably not. "
"14770920","14776020"," Whenever that stupid shit happens, it's usually like one big green bar to heaven rolls, slams right"
"14776020","14776620"," back down."
"14776900","14782820"," Do they front run that as the question?"
"14784000","14790050"," We are primed for that next step."
"14790740","14799860"," My expectation for tomorrow, if you had like pinned me down to something, you get 25 BPS and you're"
"14799860","14800780"," going to get a pause. "
"14801620","14802960"," No data dependency."
"14803520","14805980"," This is in the press release, not in the discussion."
"14807980","14814780"," I do think along with that, you do get him saying data dependent in the presser. "
"14816020","14818280"," So, so tag me to that."
"14818460","14822340"," Like the official statement from the Fed, 25 BPS."
"14823200","14824140"," A pause. "
"14825280","14826600"," No talk about data dependent."
"14827680","14829780"," The presser, he's going to threaten you."
"14830920","14831960"," That's a fucking looly. "
"14839740","14841400"," That's a fucking looly."
"14841780","14847000"," I know some of you out there think is going to come out and like, I saw someone yesterday say,"
"14847300","14853180"," they said, they said Jerome's going to come out, say mission accomplished and drop the microphone."
"14855600","14857120"," Margaret's going to go to the fucking moon. "
"14864100","14865180"," My sentiment."
"14867040","14870040"," I wish he would hammer us with 50 BPS."
"14870900","14871640"," I do. "
"14872020","14877460"," And my other sentiment here, my real thought process is no matter what he says tomorrow."
"14878700","14881860"," I think you're out of your fucking mind that we're not getting more rate increases."
"14882780","14884700"," I do not think we're done. "
"14885400","14886120"," I don't."
"14886120","14887440"," I don't."
"14888400","14894520"," From my experience, they are a hammer and they suck at what they do. "
"14894760","14894860"," So."
"14896920","14904360"," I think, I think you're going to see rates, rates holding for longer or some kind of blend of that."
"14905260","14908760"," Like you'll see a pause, but not a."
"14909620","14914780"," You won't see like a lowering of rates anytime soon. "
"14916120","14921280"," I think you're going to see rates pause, but they ain't fucking like, I think they're, I think"
"14921280","14924200"," people are like, yeah, fuck, yeah, man, we're going to fucking lower rates."
"14924400","14928960"," And by December, man, we're going to start cutting rates by January March."
"14928960","14930720"," And I don't, I don't think they're going to do that. "
"14930940","14937420"," I think they're, I think they're in like this austerity, austerity austerity, but I think when"
"14937420","14938380"," there's like part of the."
"14939300","14942880"," I think they're done with the crazy wild moves."
"14942880","14946540"," I think you're going to see like 7% for a period of fucking time. "
"14947180","14951020"," And I would not shock me to see him come back and like March and raise rates."
"14952520","14955600"," After all of you monsters are out there fucking."
"14956380","14957760"," Taking on new loans. "
"14959200","14960560"," Refinance in your shit."
"14962120","14964300"," Taking all your debt, repackaging it."
"14965080","14969740"," And high variable rate loans and you're going to, you're going to basically, not you, like maybe"
"14969740","14970500"," not you, but. "
"14971220","14973580"," 70% of you out there are going to get fucked."
"14980620","14983140"," Like March or June of next year or something."
"14986340","14988680"," Or at least they're going to attempt to do that, I think. "
"14996040","14999740"," I think the only way to, I think you got to trap these old people."
"15000400","15001780"," Are you going to trap boomers?"
"15002000","15002580"," They're not believe it."
"15002700","15004020"," They're smarter than they've ever been. "
"15007480","15008860"," It's the age of the internet."
"15012260","15013700"," Jerome's got some work to do."
"15014700","15017000"," I'll be honest, like I'm a bull, right?"
"15017240","15018100"," But I'm a fucking bear. "
"15018280","15021060"," I got to be honest with you guys like deep down inside."
"15022540","15025100"," I want to fucking clean out so many companies."
"15025620","15027580"," I want to clean out fucking all these old people. "
"15028140","15030520"," I want, I really do like deep down inside."
"15030520","15032160"," I don't want to say this shit, but."
"15032160","15039580"," And I don't think, I don't think, I think for him to do that, there's only two ways, like. "
"15040360","15043440"," I don't know how he does it."
"15043640","15047840"," He either has to be a monster and play the, and politics aren't going to allow him to do that."
"15048960","15053320"," So I don't know how you like, you got to clean out these old people, man. "
"15053540","15054080"," You got to."
"15062160","15064760"," Like you're fucking with the natural cycle of things."
"15066380","15067440"," Who said it?"
"15067580","15069280"," Was it Barry that said it that one time?"
"15070060","15073680"," Mike, Mike Barry said something like we've artificially. "
"15074960","15078740"," Like with this whole COVID shit, we have like artificially."
"15082600","15087200"," Retarded the natural like Darwinism of capitalistic markets."
"15089220","15091640"," We've given a second chance people that didn't deserve it. "
"15093620","15094800"," And they didn't fuck it up."
"15094940","15096780"," They actually took, they actually did the right thing."
"15099480","15103940"," They did the right thing. "
"15104140","15108920"," They didn't actually spend it at the, at the casino, like the zeit guests likes to tell us."
"15109020","15114320"," They actually did pay off their debt and they renovated their homes and they, they, they re-upped"
"15114320","15114920"," on their businesses."
"15115600","15116760"," And they said, oh shit, I made a mistake. "
"15116940","15118660"," I'm going to do better the next time with all this free money."
"15120500","15122600"," They have to go through that stupid cycle again."
"15129960","15132200"," So Mike Barry, oh Jimmy, I'm not Mike. "
"15132320","15132700"," I said Mike."
"15132840","15133620"," I mean Jimmy Barry."
"15135620","15137840"," Jimmy Barry and I were having a conversation recently. "
"15138160","15140160"," We were like, you know, you have like that."
"15140300","15145580"," We have that natural like, you guys know what the cycle is short, short, long term debt cycles."
"15146480","15147940"," And COVID fucked that all up. "
"15148340","15149360"," Like totally."
"15153540","15156680"," It's like pushed off this stupid like debt cycle."
"15165900","15168980"," I'm in calls here, by the way, just so you know, I don't know if I told you guys earlier"
"15168980","15169460"," or not. "
"15169860","15170900"," They did buy this dip."
"15171100","15178700"," So they're in this stupid like, I know you guys, you guys are told lies all the time."
"15178820","15181240"," They're like, Oh dude, they wasted all that COVID money. "
"15181340","15182120"," They didn't do that dude."
"15182120","15184140"," They fucking invested it."
"15184360","15185280"," They did the right thing. "
"15185400","15185920"," They're not dumb."
"15189360","15190820"," They really did it."
"15190880","15192460"," They fucking did it. "
"15194320","15196740"," Some people were dumb as fuck, but not everybody."
"15197180","15198600"," There were some smart people out there."
"15198720","15201340"," They were like, hell no, paint off my bills. "
"15202180","15203920"," Hell no, I'm renovating my house."
"15204300","15204660"," Hell no."
"15205680","15207320"," I fucked up this business deal. "
"15207500","15210280"," I'm going to I'm going to reinvest again and try it a second time."
"15210840","15213580"," Or people that never had a dollar in their pocket."
"15215760","15216720"," Dude, I get it. "
"15216860","15217860"," I want to say this stuff."
"15218040","15220660"," Some of this stuff publicly is like, there's some stuff I want to say like."
"15222320","15223440"," Hold on a second here. "
"15223840","15224460"," Oh, yeah."
"15224700","15225140"," Pay me, baby."
"15225460","15226980"," Pay me. "
"15228400","15229160"," Pay me."
"15231400","15232640"," Like I got some friends."
"15234340","15238400"," I got some friends here in Detroit and some of them are business owners and. "
"15240840","15243060"," They were like, you know, like, what do I do during COVID?"
"15243180","15244140"," And I was like, I'll tell you what."
"15244280","15245340"," I was like, don't fuck it up."
"15245560","15249460"," I was like, I was like, you're probably never fucking getting reparations. "
"15249680","15251840"," I was like, this is your chance."
"15252480","15254180"," I was like, take, you know, you got this money."
"15254340","15256920"," They're giving you fucking make something of it. "
"15257700","15260140"," You know, these are very close friends of mine and they did."
"15260320","15261660"," They broke their dicks with that money."
"15261840","15262020"," So. "
"15265060","15269460"," You know, like not everybody fucking squandered that money."
"15269460","15271380"," People fucking did the right thing."
"15276520","15278540"," Yeah, there has been no capitulation. "
"15278540","15279320"," I agree, Joe."
"15280640","15287450"," Yeah, I agree with that statement too, Jimmy."
"15288330","15289990"," The Fed wants inflation arise. "
"15290270","15291290"," That's reducing their debt."
"15291470","15292470"," I agree with that statement too."
"15298580","15299420"," Well, we haven't even. "
"15299640","15302240"," Jimmy, if you want to get into the rest of the conversation, right?"
"15302760","15305040"," We can start talking about the cheapness of money."
"15305040","15311780"," We can start talking about expectations for PE ratios going up."
"15312740","15317640"," We got all kinds of other ramifications of why the stock market should go up. "
"15318820","15326900"," All kinds, you got ramifications of wealthy people needing to put their money to work, putting risk"
"15326900","15327920"," on when they shouldn't be."
"15328580","15331180"," They're going to do it anyway, so the money's going to flow into the market."
"15333580","15336780"," Cheapness of money over time, regardless of you fighting inflation. "
"15337300","15340600"," The longer we trade down in sideways, we haven't even addressed."
"15341740","15344900"," You know, it was some fascinating guy that I respect."
"15345660","15347200"," I have a lot of respect to this guy. "
"15347580","15351900"," I watched one of his videos last night and this guy is not a furu."
"15353580","15358940"," He's like a guy from CNBC and he still couldn't get over the fact of relating."
"15361520","15368400"," The index is two stocks and, you know, he's like, hey, this is where the stock market is. "
"15368640","15370280"," We should roll over at 480."
"15371460","15373580"," He made a good point."
"15373960","15379160"," He was like, when we get to 4800, he's like the market should roll over there. "
"15380600","15386440"," And he wasn't saying like the market will roll and then go higher."
"15386440","15388500"," It's like five or six thousand."
"15389840","15391540"," He said, we'll go to 4,800. "
"15391960","15394480"," We should have a major pullback."
"15395080","15397780"," I think everybody expects that too and I agree with that statement."
"15399120","15400520"," Now you trade 4,800. "
"15401200","15403360"," You pull back and then you trade 5,000."
"15404740","15405780"," In 2024."
"15407080","15410080"," But I was like, fuck no, I was like 6,000. "
"15411240","15414460"," The target is likely 6,000, not 5,000."
"15414460","15417900"," And he couldn't wrap his head around it."
"15418580","15424280"," And my point was you have reprised the underlying in this stuff. "
"15425940","15428580"," Major repricing in the stock market has gone on."
"15428860","15430560"," It's still still ongoing, right?"
"15431080","15439460"," You saw Disney, ATT, you see Verizon, you see Target, you see, we can just list the companies off,"
"15439620","15439720"," right?"
"15440540","15442000"," Let me see it."
"15442020","15443160"," And what's the other one there?"
"15443240","15444780"," PayPal, you see it in. "
"15446160","15447060"," There's another one too."
"15447440","15449380"," One that makes Tyson chicken tenders."
"15449860","15452120"," All those companies get him your prize. "
"15452120","15453260"," You saw it in regional banks."
"15457780","15459520"," You saw it in spec growth."
"15461040","15462500"," And it didn't kill these companies. "
"15463360","15466820"," You see companies that have still have year-of-year profits, year-of-year growth."
"15468120","15470180"," Great guidance, selling real products."
"15471320","15472970"," They all got reprised. "
"15473740","15475960"," There's some left, but most got reprised."
"15476380","15478760"," A lot of the healthcare stocks have not been reprised."
"15479320","15480620"," I can't wait till that shit happens. "
"15481300","15482380"," They're coming for you."
"15482540","15486280"," If you want those healthcare companies, they're going to fucking mow you down."
"15487040","15488460"," You're going back, I promise. "
"15495830","15497490"," He couldn't wrap his head around that."
"15497490","15500830"," I was like, dude, I can totally see 6,000 easily."
"15501650","15503590"," I know you don't want to hear that, but I can see that. "
"15508500","15510700"," Yeah, inflation never goes away, does it, Jimmy?"
"15512120","15513560"," It never does really go."
"15513620","15514900"," You never really do catch up, do you?"
"15525580","15526800"," No, I disagree with that."
"15527040","15533820"," All these healthcare stocks that moon from COVID, I can't see the valuations. "
"15535240","15536320"," I can't see it."
"15536500","15538380"," I can't look at these companies that were traded."
"15538600","15541760"," They're pre-COVID price and they're priced right now. "
"15541760","15542340"," I disagree."
"15543660","15544720"," I fucking disagree."
"15545800","15547980"," I heard that about fucking Tesla and went to 100 bucks. "
"15548900","15550460"," So I don't want to hear it."
"15551540","15552220"," I disagree."
"15552900","15553740"," We agreed to disagree. "
"15560700","15561760"," No, no, no, no."
"15561780","15562820"," I'm not talking about old people stocks."
"15563860","15564980"," I'm a COVID shit. "
"15564980","15567580"," It have not been re-priced."
"15574540","15576100"," Yeah, you see 600-spy."
"15576240","15576540"," I do, too. "
"15576960","15577840"," I see it, too, man."
"15578760","15580220"," And he couldn't wrap his head around that."
"15580420","15582020"," I respect this guy a ton. "
"15582500","15585840"," He kept associating stock prices with index prices."
"15586980","15589960"," And I was like, you know what, one of the key indicators of this is?"
"15590760","15595220"," Do you see some of those, you know, some of those spec growth companies that we look at?"
"15595760","15598280"," And some of them look like they're going to squeeze right now."
"15598780","15602860"," And some of them look like they've got a lot of volatility before they make that big squeeze. "
"15603960","15610240"," I think those companies are going to fight to move higher into end of year."
"15610900","15616180"," And they're going to pull back and that big squeeze that they're expecting later on, that's going"
"15616180","15620460"," to be your 6,000 on spoos when those companies actually go there."
"15634210","15635270"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"15635270","15637190"," I don't think inflation goes away."
"15637630","15639010"," Money always becomes cheaper."
"15639650","15640810"," I'm in that camp with you. "
"15641870","15643550"," We have the other problem, too, right?"
"15643730","15644830"," You know what the other problem is here?"
"15645430","15647610"," There's one more major problem no one likes to talk about."
"15648650","15650050"," And you know what that is?"
"15650450","15651670"," That's the presidential election."
"15652630","15653690"," All you need. "
"15657460","15659180"," All you need, right?"
"15659660","15663180"," All you need is a populist to run."
"15664680","15668280"," Like a, like a, like a rock, believe it or not, like a Dwayne The Rock or something."
"15668500","15670200"," The Rock Johnson guy, like someone like him. "
"15670960","15675200"," Someone that you can't really test the political belief to that everybody likes."
"15676080","15677800"," Like Democrats, Republicans."
"15680440","15683280"," His politics and his division matter less. "
"15683660","15685500"," And he just says something stupid like."
"15688220","15702050"," You get"
"15702050","15704370"," some like, you get someone that runs for office."
"15705570","15707410"," And all they have to say. "
"15711350","15714310"," There's that nice big squeeze up to our two right now."
"15715690","15722610"," All they have to say beautiful little dip by down here, push up, come down, tag it, boom, and bag"
"15722610","15723210"," it to the upside."
"15723590","15725270"," Remember, we talked about a failure in our two. "
"15725710","15729110"," Remember that earlier today, we talked about a failure in our two, take some money."
"15730270","15733150"," We can squeeze up and above, start taking some risk off."
"15735450","15736270"," How's it get up here?"
"15742080","15743640"," All you need is someone like that to run. "
"15743940","15744680"," And I'm going to tell you why."
"15744820","15745700"," You might disagree with that."
"15745980","15747880"," Now, I'm going to, this is in relation to the stock market. "
"15747960","15751220"," I want to tell you guys some young guys out there, not you old guys."
"15751900","15754040"," The old guys already know the young guys don't."
"15757140","15758620"," You're going to learn, though, as you get older. "
"15759580","15761060"," And a lot of people want a bit to this."
"15762320","15765240"," They won't publicly admit it to their wives or kids or nobody."
"15766160","15770420"," But truly, even this, you know, hate hearing this. "
"15771840","15778560"," But if you had someone like that run for president, that could appeal to a populist vote."
"15778840","15780240"," That's not diverse divisive."
"15782360","15786960"," When they say something stupid, like we're going to make America great again, but not like the"
"15786960","15787460"," Trump way. "
"15787840","15791960"," But like, hey, you know, we're going to make sure that you can get paid more and your taxes are"
"15791960","15794640"," going to go down and your investments are going to go up."
"15794640","15796260"," And we don't care if you're public in a Democrat."
"15796280","15799300"," If that person runs, they would sweep an election. "
"15799460","15800320"," It'd be very much like Reagan."
"15801340","15804440"," And if you see some shit like that, things will get crazy."
"15805140","15807140"," Like, not in a good way. "
"15807540","15810980"," You could see like just pouring out our economy again."
"15811940","15815200"," And I'm not a proponent or a opponent of this."
"15815320","15820180"," I'm just saying if that were to happen, that's like a variable that's not priced into this market. "
"15821240","15823620"," That would not price in 6,000."
"15823640","15825460"," You'd see us hit 6,000 like it was nothing."
"15826160","15827580"," It was nothing. "
"15828780","15831280"," That's one of my big fears is do we get something at that?"
"15831500","15837060"," And the reason I'm saying this to you is because there are voting class out there that actually"
"15837060","15837400"," vote."
"15838220","15841480"," You might be sentimental about, I don't know."
"15842520","15849660"," I think the country's going to burn to the ground or sentimental that this class of people have at"
"15849660","15850920"," worst in this class of people. "
"15851180","15853960"," But then there's the actual voting class, the people that shut up the vote."
"15854620","15856580"," And they are mostly people that own homes."
"15857280","15859420"," Mostly people that pay a lot of taxes. "
"15860480","15863080"," Mostly people with children, whether you like it or not."
"15864080","15867900"," Business owners, a contracted employees."
"15869460","15872580"," Those, they're not employees I guess, but subcontractors, contractors. "
"15873840","15875520"," Now that's your majority of your voting class."
"15875520","15882660"," And they will fucking straight lie to you and go and slam that, slam that vote button just for"
"15882660","15883340"," cheaper taxes."
"15884480","15885180"," That's it. "
"15886840","15891260"," Cheaper taxes and a promise that they're going to be able to party."
"15892140","15893680"," It's so gross, but it's real."
"15894920","15897220"," That's another boogeyman nobody likes to talk about. "
"15916520","15933080"," They read"
"15933080","15933840"," what you guys are saying."
"15936500","15937760"," Yeah, election cycle."
"15938040","15938960"," I see you not like. "
"15940500","15942720"," I don't know if that person's going to run."
"15942860","15944520"," I don't see DeSantis as that person."
"15945100","15946960"," I don't see Biden as that person. "
"15948300","15949500"," You'll know him or her."
"15950220","15952340"," I don't know if the man or woman, but if you see that person run."
"15953080","15954120"," I don't know if they'll let him. "
"15954420","15956960"," That person they might let run for president."
"15958100","15962280"," Squeeze and I are now to R2, 456, 59."
"15966410","15968410"," Yeah, Reagan did the same thing after Carter. "
"15969110","15974650"," That's what I'm thinking because it seems like the Fed wants to pull like a 50s to 1970s shit."
"15975010","15977470"," And the greed dude behind the scenes."
"15977890","15979350"," I'm telling you like there's this greed. "
"15979950","15983970"," Like if you try to pin our market down and pin the economy down long enough."
"15984510","15987650"," The greed is just going to seep out of the pores of people."
"15988590","15989650"," It's so gross. "
"15999920","16000360"," Yeah."
"16000460","16001100"," How do you say?"
"16001200","16001980"," Jay Powell is no choice."
"16001980","16003680"," He's going to dump fucking ice water markets. "
"16003680","16007240"," He's headed over to Jans for a nice stiff leather clad beatings."
"16007240","16009020"," This is all tenderized tomorrow tomorrow."
"16012920","16014440"," Then we get the movie. "
"16014700","16015760"," The W."
"16016120","16019740"," I'm telling you that shit wouldn't."
"16019840","16021620"," That shit wouldn't phase me."
"16021960","16024580"," It would not fucking phase me in any way, shape or form. "
"16024580","16026280"," That shit would never phase me."
"16026360","16029040"," I wouldn't be I wouldn't be shocked in the fucking in the least."
"16030600","16032700"," Like greed knows no bounds. "
"16034400","16036280"," Like not until I got in this."
"16036580","16037480"," Well, I shouldn't say that."
"16038460","16045400"," Being inside C suites, I finally saw my first real true like monster, like monster in the closet"
"16045400","16045820"," greed. "
"16045820","16050940"," And like the like the like the like the like the two-faced like the CEO."
"16051180","16054720"," Some of these CEOs are like some of the most two-faced people you ever fucking meet."
"16055340","16060540"," And they'll never be public about it in a public, but public space behind a close door. "
"16060680","16061300"," They're fucking monsters."
"16062140","16066720"," And then when I got in the stock market, that's when I realized the same shit was going on."
"16073670","16077090"," Yeah, nine has been cast as cash rates are twenty one percent. "
"16085530","16088690"," You know, this is going to be a divisive topic here for you."
"16088710","16089110"," You want one?"
"16089250","16090330"," You want me to throw one out there?"
"16091510","16092470"," No, I don't."
"16092630","16096570"," I'm not going to say I agree or disagree with this, but there are some people out there that are"
"16096570","16096790"," like. "
"16097990","16103210"," If you really look at what what Trump was looking to do with Biden is done."
"16103330","16103930"," They're pretty similar."
"16104470","16106290"," It's whatever kind of cough therapy wants. "
"16106370","16107750"," It's kind of gross to say that."
"16108370","16110390"," I know a lot of you got to be like, that's not true."
"16110410","16112450"," But there are people that look at those data points. "
"16112670","16116710"," They're like, eh, what kind of cough therapy wants."
"16118950","16126850"," Now four fifty six fifty nine right now trading the tag are two going up to the top right now."
"16127550","16129170"," We're going to put some music on for that one. "
"16138310","16144450"," Damn, just moving, running the fed decision."
"16147270","16165860"," I bet"
"16165860","16169300"," that last thing would piss off both Democrats and Republicans, right?"
"16169960","16173040"," You have like Trump supporters that are like Biden's not like Trump."
"16173460","16178480"," And you got Bush or Biden supporters who he got, you know what I mean?"
"16178580","16181980"," You got like Trump supporters are like, there ain't no way that Biden's like Trump. "
"16182000","16184240"," And you got fucking Biden supporters are like, there ain't no way."
"16185060","16187680"," Biden's like Trump's saying the same shit."
"16191380","16192920"," Look at that, baby. "
"16194100","16197240"," Trading four fifty six sixty four."
"16199820","16202180"," Huge moves on the spy."
"16203460","16205820"," Decent trends, not great, but decent. "
"16207560","16211020"," Trading are to front running the fed meeting."
"16232930","16235790"," We asked the question earlier."
"16236650","16241050"," Normally, we would expect the hedge on the market. "
"16242330","16245040"," We asked that one thirty this afternoon."
"16246190","16251230"," Do you think that they're going to hedge into the clothes?"
"16255960","16257960"," You got, I told you what my vote was."
"16258580","16260100"," Wakey, what are the results brother?"
"16263000","16267710"," Did people think the hedge into tomorrow?"
"16269450","16272810"," Or did we think as a group that fucked that they're going to front run it?"
"16274110","16275710"," I want to know the answer, Wink. "
"16276070","16276850"," What's the answer brother?"
"16283130","16284070"," Let's hear it."
"16284270","16285870"," Did they get it right or did they get it wrong?"
"16290320","16290840"," Nice."
"16292620","16293500"," Very nice. "
"16293860","16295280"," You guys won the poll again."
"16296600","16298740"," We have good voters in our stream."
"16299000","16299600"," Fuck yeah. "
"16306250","16308530"," I'm going to be looking for a poll back here."
"16312910","16316090"," And try to buy this good bad boy right here."
"16317910","16320810"," If it fails, I'm going to put stops down here. "
"16338300","16340180"," I can't believe it, Winkie."
"16340840","16344200"," Dude, our fucking, our audience, our fucking audience rules."
"16345580","16347760"," I got to say something to you. "
"16347760","16349820"," To any of you that voted out there."
"16350700","16353120"," We turned this, the chats on YouTube."
"16354220","16358060"," And switched to subscriber only because we were getting bad alpha. "
"16358660","16359620"," Counter alpha."
"16360620","16361920"," And I want to thank you."
"16362420","16367120"," We worked hard to not get counter alpha in our streams. "
"16368020","16370060"," And dude, you guys have been killing it."
"16370680","16374100"," Whenever we run one of these polls, you guys are right most of the time."
"16374100","16378440"," And sure enough, we had a question back here this afternoon. "
"16379060","16380880"," Do we start the hedge down?"
"16381440","16384480"," Or do we not hedge and start pricing it in?"
"16385000","16387040"," And you chose right as of right now."
"16387080","16387939"," You've done a good job."
"16388140","16391360"," So we just traded R2 at 456 60. "
"16392000","16394400"," Good job on the polling answers."
"16395080","16398300"," Thank you for not answering that poll emotionally."
"16399020","16401040"," Thank you for answering that poll honestly. "
"16402540","16404880"," You know, you can't trust a lot of polls on Twitter."
"16405460","16407779"," So I'm very grateful for you guys taking that poll."
"16409040","16410040"," Hell yeah. "
"16418050","16425720"," Good job, good job."
"16429450","16431930"," I'm close, put our calls right now."
"16432669","16433950"," I am flat right now. "
"16434090","16438610"," I'm looking for not a rollover, but I'm looking for any kind of a chance to buy a dip here"
"16438610","16441669"," or here to the upside."
"16444509","16446330"," See if they'll front run this shit."
"16447270","16449430"," Would not shock me to see them front run it. "
"16454140","16455640"," Squeeze out every last bit."
"16455740","16457419"," It looks like there's a little bit of a top right here."
"16458259","16459400"," Keep your eye right here. "
"16460439","16461360"," Just right here."
"16463680","16465900"," Looks like it's somewhere in here."
"16475840","16478960"," Maybe a little bit lower, 457 right there. "
"16489500","16490740"," Mr. Talking Monkey."
"16490960","16493599"," We look at a Palantir for you, brother."
"16493599","16493939"," Hold on. "
"16499830","16501669"," Mr. Talking Monkey."
"16502529","16502570"," Yes."
"16504029","16505910"," I like Palantir here as well. "
"16506290","16512529"," As long as it stays above $16.57. Yes, you should get a push higher, brother."
"16514590","16517650"," You probably go back up there and test that 1735."
"16519210","16522290"," 1786 and then go back and fight with the 1870. "
"16523470","16525310"," It's a good place to buy a dip with a monthly."
"16526689","16528250"," I do like it here a lot, brother."
"16530830","16534869"," Spy trading 4673 right now. "
"16551310","16551790"," 237."
"16554570","16557150"," Man, anybody know if Chase is all right out there?"
"16557150","16569439"," Yeah, I"
"16569439","16570640"," want to know if Chase is okay."
"16574669","16577390"," I'm being serious, not being facetious here. "
"16578169","16581009"," I want to make sure he's all right."
"16587560","16590040"," TGT, not interested in covering it."
"16590180","16591939"," I'm not a day trader of TGT. "
"16591939","16594740"," I'm a buyer of the underlying and looking at it in three months."
"16599070","16599830"," Rip bears."
"16600910","16609200"," Yeah, I kind of feel bad for Chase right now. "
"16609259","16610840"," He probably got pushed out here at some point."
"16613540","16618320"," This is the, so this, this right here is the previous high, right?"
"16618919","16621980"," You guys know that this is the previous side just a few days ago."
"16623720","16626300"," So this is the, let's take a look at it. "
"16626580","16627720"," Just so you guys can see it."
"16629860","16631740"," Full retracement with a new high."
"16631740","16634340"," This is not good for bears that don't want to see this. "
"16635300","16638520"," Just want to give you guys a heads up for this right now."
"16639800","16643900"," So here is your, here is your previous high right here."
"16644740","16646759"," We just made a new high. "
"16647740","16648779"," That's not bearish."
"16649599","16650840"," Okay, just heads up."
"16650980","16651960"," You got a new high. "
"16652619","16654180"," You did not get the failure."
"16655380","16657820"," The failure is the double top, right?"
"16659599","16664980"," The cup and handle is the, did not get a failure."
"16665980","16671040"," Actually got the new high boom, tagged it previous high right here. "
"16672180","16678060"," That actually gives a little bit of, actually gives a little bit of credence to the cup and handle"
"16678060","16680460"," proposal that's out there."
"16681500","16682980"," Just a heads up on that right now."
"16683080","16684820"," If you can see it right there, got the new high. "
"16688509","16690230"," Look at that rotation."
"16690630","16695130"," I think I got a text from somebody that said I'm bearish here."
"16695730","16698029"," And I was like, uh, not me. "
"16698529","16699410"," So there we go."
"16699930","16700490"," We did it."
"16701009","16702750"," If you're a bull, congratulations. "
"16704270","16705189"," Target achieved."
"16705650","16708750"," You got a new high on the spy."
"16716160","16717520"," And does it feel good?"
"16717700","16718099"," Is the question. "
"16721700","16723279"," You should feel good."
"16723500","16725660"," That was, that was a doozy right there."
"16726259","16730119"," Bears did not, did not want to see that right there. "
"16730660","16731939"," Absolutely not."
"16738750","16741270"," A little bit of revenge trade on that one."
"16742450","16743050"," Definitely. "
"16744070","16748210"," I'd be pissed off if I was a seller and saw that."
"16748509","16753050"," If I was, I'm not going to go and fint to it and say anything because I'm sure like Jedi"
"16753050","16756270"," Marcus or somebody has already made a comment about that right there."
"16756750","16760349"," That was a doozy right there. "
"16793870","16794510"," Man."
"16812660","16812980"," Whoo."
"16878290","16879870"," See those targets up there. "
"16887140","16889020"," So those targets hiding out up there."
"16890820","16891860"," Hidden levels up."
"16892040","16892800"," There's one right there. "
"16904040","16911490"," You want to see that hold right here."
"16911590","16912510"," You see that one right there."
"16914790","16917170"," I want to see all this hold right here. "
"16947800","16949960"," Let's see where our three is up here."
"16950120","16952220"," If we can even get up there for 58 dude."
"16954120","16955840"," They're saying no on that one. "
"16966250","16970710"," They're trying to tell you or the dealers are saying there's no way we get up there to the close"
"16970710","16971410"," to our three."
"16974670","16976370"," We're only trading 21 cents."
"16978710","16992470"," Yeah, please,"
"16992610","16994050"," so we'll do a couple of things right here. "

"18159320","18161080"," Do you guys want a fourth ticker?"
"18161160","18163000"," Do you want to do spy or cues?"
"18163820","18167380"," Any preference on the reports at 4 pm?"
"18168140","18172840"," Let me know in the chat if you have like an overwhelming pay, you're missed this one or you want"
"18172840","18175600"," this one with anything you don't want up."
"18176560","18179660"," You guys like the idea of Google Microsoft and Snapper. "
"18179760","18183760"," Do you guys have like, oh my god, there's one ticker nobody's talking about everybody loves it?"
"18184400","18185180"," Let me know in the chat."
"18192510","18194310"," Well, you guys have been harping on hood, man."
"18194850","18196490"," And if snow would be a good one. "
"18198350","18199590"," Spy, I'm going to write this down."
"18201610","18204350"," I never reviewed spy, or I never reviewed hood today."
"18205190","18207550"," There were people who have been asking about it all day long. "
"18209350","18210550"," Oh, Robin Hood."
"18212510","18213730"," Sell the fuck out of it."
"18216050","18218250"," Sell the fuck out of it down to 12 bucks. "
"18219190","18219550"," I'm serious."
"18221850","18223710"," Sell the fuck out of hood."
"18224590","18225950"," I'm being dead serious. "
"18226450","18227150"," That's not sentiment."
"18230310","18231610"," So there you got your answer."
"18231750","18233210"," Sell hood down to $12. "
"18238600","18240620"," I'll write that one down though, hood."
"18243920","18244440"," Snow."
"18252100","18253300"," What else we got here?"
"18256400","18257280"," Google Microsoft. "
"18257640","18258140"," Yeah, you like that?"
"18262340","18263240"," You like the stuff?"
"18263380","18263680"," Last time."
"18263700","18263900"," Okay."
"18264340","18264720"," We did. "
"18264920","18267020"," I believe we charted out snap Google and."
"18268580","18269680"," Snap Google and."
"18275280","18277600"," Was it snap Google and. "
"18279700","18280580"," Microsoft misfit."
"18280800","18280980"," So."
"18288480","18289960"," No, we'll keep all three of those up. "
"18294120","18296080"," We've been covering a lot of the."
"18297600","18301580"," Oil tickers, not, not so much oil itself, but the."
"18302780","18306540"," The distribution refinery corpse and all that kind of stuff. "
"18306540","18307620"," They've printed really well."
"18308000","18309860"," Someone's asking about Exxon mobile."
"18310320","18316060"," It's very bullish right now, extremely bullish and it's looking to start to squeeze. "
"18316980","18318500"," I'm very bullish on it."
"18318640","18321000"," I would really like to see it get above."
"18322380","18324580"," $106 and 49 cents. "
"18325540","18327240"," And hold that level."
"18327860","18330980"," I want to see it like retest that like get above 106."
"18331440","18331960"," Hold it. "
"18333460","18335560"," And then start to move higher."
"18336020","18336480"," So zoom."
"18336780","18337760"," I'm bullish on it. "
"18337900","18338420"," Generally speaking."
"18339700","18342740"," Yeah, you are looking to go back up and slam $120."
"18343480","18344840"," $19 somewhere in there. "
"18346100","18347760"," I am bullish on it though right now."
"18347820","18349960"," Your daily trigger is underneath price right now."
"18351000","18357700"," Put your stops below 104.51. Was the other one that you asked for?"
"18357960","18358320"," I saw. "
"18358760","18360460"," Sorry, I'm trying to read the chat right now."
"18360700","18362660"," That goes by so fucking fast."
"18366820","18369500"," Who asked for for XOM and. "
"18371820","18372980"," Was one other one."
"18377260","18377700"," Teladoc."
"18386640","18388020"," Well, I haven't seen that one. "
"18388140","18390580"," I haven't traded that one in a long fucking time either."
"18393780","18395400"," Not so bullish on this one."
"18396540","18398280"," It's a good intradate day trade. "
"18398420","18400400"," I'm not a fan of Teladoc health right now."
"18400820","18401780"," I like the company."
"18401960","18402680"," I'll be honest with you. "
"18402760","18403680"," I still like the company."
"18406840","18408920"," Let me look at them in a higher time frame."
"18414030","18414930"," Yeah, dude. "
"18415310","18416210"," I kind of like them."
"18417110","18419330"," I see what your point is on Teladoc."
"18421030","18424030"," I haven't looked at their fundamentals in a minute. "
"18425130","18425550"," I'll be honest."
"18427030","18428590"," I'll be honest with you."
"18428690","18430350"," I'm going to say somebody done Teladoc. "
"18430490","18431330"," You've got no trade."
"18432290","18432810"," Currently."
"18433570","18438450"," Unless it gets above $26 and holds above $26. "
"18440670","18441470"," Dangerous trade."
"18441830","18443730"," Dangerous bull trade right now in Teladoc."
"18444270","18445430"," I'm not a fan right now. "
"18446230","18447250"," It has work to do."
"18449590","18452610"," I'd like to know what the pre IPO price was too."
"18454490","18458290"," Would not be shocked to see it go down to right back down to $10. "
"18458550","18458930"," I'll be honest."
"18459290","18461230"," And I like Teladoc as a company."
"18466990","18468450"," But XOM, I like it more. "
"18468910","18469770"," I like this better trade."
"18478340","18479160"," Come on, baby."
"18479340","18480020"," Print it up for daddy. "
"18481300","18483360"," You can always fucking bears, man."
"18486940","18487720"," Fucking bears."
"18488680","18490040"," Never ending bears. "
"18493020","18494300"," I feel bad for girls."
"18494500","18495140"," I love them, but."
"18497380","18500560"," I realize that that was some real pain right there. "
"18500660","18501080"," I can tell."
"18503360","18506780"," I can tell that was some painful experience right there."
"18510160","18512640"," Would not be shocked to see this get pinned. "
"18514620","18517520"," Blood and then you move up, so be aware of that."
"18517680","18519180"," Be conscious of this into the clothes."
"18521200","18523300"," Would not be shocked to see this today. "
"18523360","18524080"," Something like this."
"18526040","18527800"," Blast down, blast up."
"18529580","18531060"," That's if we get good reports. "
"18531760","18533360"," If we get bad reports."
"18534980","18537020"," It would be a different way, right?"
"18538680","18541720"," If you get bad reports, you're going to see something like this."
"18543500","18545140"," Right, bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"18545300","18547540"," Down move, quick move up, then blast down."
"18553290","18555430"," I think reports today are a mixed bag."
"18558790","18559950"," Teladoc, who. "
"18561590","18564610"," I can't I can't in good faith say yes."
"18566990","18568410"," Even with their ER."
"18568730","18569310"," I can't. "
"18569650","18571530"," I need to see price above."
"18572730","18575330"," Their weekly is really bad right now."
"18575430","18578210"," Their daily is so that their daily is bearish. "
"18578310","18579710"," Their weekly is bearish."
"18580050","18581570"," Prices below the hourly."
"18583810","18587990"," My fear here, you know, the Teladoc can go to 10 bucks. "
"18589090","18590630"," It can get repriced."
"18591230","18593630"," Even if they have good ERs, a lot of companies."
"18595050","18597570"," Have taken a fucking bath. "
"18598690","18600670"," Even with good earnings and good guidance."
"18602590","18607050"," So I can't in good, even if it goes up, even if Teladoc were to go up 20% after"
"18607050","18610470"," the bell, 50% after the bell, 100% after the bell, I don't care."
"18611130","18618690"," Cants in good faith from price action say that Teladoc is in a healthy place right now, even with a"
"18618690","18618910"," good ER. "
"18620310","18622470"," And I would also say make another statement on this."
"18622690","18627550"," If Teladoc does have a good ER and squeezes, I don't, I'm not sure that it will hold."
"18629490","18636170"," I can't in like, can't say yeah, there's like positive buying going on on Teladoc right now. "
"18636470","18637370"," Maybe I'm wrong in this."
"18637470","18638590"," Maybe Winky can look at it."
"18639310","18642670"," And see if he sees something different that I don't see. "
"18643390","18644810"," I see what you're saying."
"18645530","18648870"," I can see the dip buying going back far, far, far, right?"
"18649110","18653650"," I've been buying this level since October of 2022."
"18655550","18661010"," It really does look to me spending that much time buying these dips down here in Teladoc. "
"18662110","18667550"," It's just begging for a, it's just begging for a capitulation moment."
"18668590","18669310"," It really is."
"18669410","18675410"," It's begging for like a huge capitulation, like just flush it to the depths of hell. "
"18676950","18678430"," I get why you want to buy it."
"18678450","18679130"," I can see why."
"18681510","18685230"," Or if you wanted to buy it here with a stop underneath it. "
"18686650","18688590"," I can't say no to that either."
"18688850","18690550"," Maybe wait until after their ER."
"18691890","18693830"," I haven't traded it in a long time. "
"18695850","18697650"," But I really like the company."
"18697830","18699270"," So I don't know what else to say to you on it."
"18706300","18708140"," What do I like about Teladoc?"
"18708400","18709680"," I think that's the future of medicine. "
"18710940","18714740"," My wife is, my wife does medicine from home."
"18731160","18732520"," Yeah, you with me on that, Winky?"
"18732700","18732980"," I agree."
"18734260","18738840"," I think it's like begging for a, it's begging for like a flush, right?"
"18740880","18742260"," Just like begging for it. "
"18745360","18747100"," You know what I would say Kenny would be."
"18748260","18752360"," If their earnings are good and you get a rip higher and it comes back down, I would say buy"
"18752360","18753020"," it there maybe."
"18754020","18756300"," For like a month, three month call or something like that. "
"18757380","18758660"," Oh, making money, baby."
"18759120","18760760"," Give Daddy some money."
"18761980","18763340"," Everybody's fearful down here. "
"18763500","18763700"," I'm here."
"18763860","18765120"," I am down here buying fucking dips."
"18767500","18768840"," Pouring myself out. "
"18769680","18770480"," Man bear pig."
"18776640","18780020"," Apple with a dip by right there."
"18783960","18785240"," Pissing off the bears. "
"18791640","18793500"," Give me a two minutes here."
"18794160","18795720"," I'm going to take a quick piss."
"18796500","18797800"," I haven't taken a pee today. "
"18799320","18801540"," I need a piss bag or something."
"18801800","18802280"," I need a diaper."
"18803220","18804960"," Okay, they're going to tell you guys a funny story. "
"18805540","18807860"," So we were making jokes about diapers and shit."
"18808680","18812540"," And fucking, fucking YouTube started showing me diaper commercials."
"18813600","18814380"," Like the pen's commercials. "
"18814880","18815500"," I shit you not."
"18816180","18817420"," So they're like listening in."
"18819960","18825020"," I can be mean to tell you guys that for fucking like, be mean to tell you guys that for"
"18825020","18825680"," some time now. "
"18825860","18827240"," If we can totally forgot to tell you that."
"18830380","18835740"," Yeah, I'm going to take a quick piss."
"18836060","18839900"," I'm going to take a quick break because we got, we got some time coming up here. "
"18840640","18841260"," A wiki."
"18841820","18845160"," Can we now run that second poll for tomorrow?"
"18847580","18848420"," If possible."
"18848700","18850740"," If you want to take a piss break with me and come back and do it. "
"18851100","18852680"," We're going to run a second poll for today."
"18852860","18857160"," This poll is going to be geared towards the Fed."
"18858380","18859360"," Is the Fed going to take a piss break?"
"18859360","18861640"," Is the Fed hawkish or dovish?"
"18863520","18867860"," I guess there would be two, like just two answers hawkish or dovish. "
"18868300","18870180"," But if you're, if you're watching it right now."
"18871020","18876020"," It's going to mean that it's rear view mirror that."
"18878100","18883820"," It's forward looking that we get 25 BPS and a pause. "
"18884360","18888000"," No discussion in the press release of."
"18888920","18889820"," Data dependence."
"18891200","18893000"," Or we're going to get hawkish fed. "
"18893380","18896540"," We're going to get language in the presser that's."
"18897860","18898900"," That ready."
"18899660","18900860"," 25 BPS. "
"18901740","18902680"," Data dependence."
"18903760","18905180"," I'm going to warn you guys of something."
"18905920","18907260"," Even talked about this. "
"18907480","18908460"," If at any fucking point."
"18910640","18913600"," In that presser, they do not change the language."
"18917460","18924020"," If they, if that language in that press release is data dependent, that is hawkish. "
"18924860","18926860"," Well, it's not, it's not collapse."
"18928100","18930360"," But we will roll over on shit like that."
"18930480","18930640"," Okay. "
"18932280","18934480"," You want, if you're a bull, you want to hear."
"18935420","18935740"," Pause."
"18936740","18937460"," 25 BPS. "
"18938280","18939400"," Rear view mirror."
"18940780","18945860"," If you hear 25 BPS and data dependence, that's hawkish."
"18947300","18948700"," It's good for the market. "
"18949560","18951280"," But you'll see a role right now."
"18953880","18956000"," Well, you know what 50 BPS is."
"18957640","18958620"," So, you know, that's really hot. "
"18958720","18959420"," That's really hawkish."
"18959700","18961700"," But I don't want you guys to know that that we are set up."
"18963040","18965740"," Unless, unless something's changed here, we are set up. "
"18965740","18969460"," The expectation is that you get 25 in a pause."
"18969780","18973160"," If you don't get that tomorrow, then you're going to fucking feel it."
"18973260","18973780"," Guarantee it. "
"18977410","18980250"," So, maybe we do, uh, dovish hawkish."
"18980510","18982050"," You get the idea and the rules on this."
"18984450","18987250"," Please vote on your answers for what you expect tomorrow. "
"18987810","18991410"," Remember, the official statement means more than the oppressor."
"18991490","18996170"," So, the official statement needs to have some kind of verbiage that is data dependent."
"18996170","18997510"," Or worse. "
"19009360","19011900"," Alright, I'll place my vote right now for you guys."
"19022210","19023550"," What's my vote?"
"19024550","19026110"," I gotta think about this."
"19032180","19034000"," Okay, there's my answer. "
"19035220","19036180"," You guys got my answer."
"19038820","19040920"," Did I vote correctly or no?"
"19041780","19042680"," Did I spell that wrong?"
"19043340","19044740"," Doesn't look like my shit went through."
"19045380","19046760"," Oh, no, I spelled it wrong. "
"19046760","19047240"," Hold on."
"19048520","19049880"," We missed the, hold on."
"19056680","19058040"," That one go through, perfect. "
"19058220","19058400"," I voted."
"19058900","19059980"," You guys got my vote?"
"19063940","19065280"," And, uh, place your votes."
"19068180","19070320"," It's, uh, you have to do an exclamation point. "
"19070700","19074240"," Then V-O-T-E and then dovish or hawkish."
"19074720","19078200"," And just the notes that were spelling dovish, d-o-v-i-s-h."
"19078200","19080320"," Not d-o-v-e-i-s-h. "
"19080380","19080940"," I fucked up."
"19083080","19085900"," We'll take the answers to that into the end of the stream."
"19086940","19090380"," Uh, we'll see what people's thoughts are on the Fed tomorrow. "
"19091440","19093240"," I'll be right back with you in just five minutes."
"19647080","19652420"," So, just so, so if you're paying attention or not, if you're in calls, you might want to be out"
"19652420","19652680"," of them."
"19652820","19656380"," I'm watching them grind down the entire options chain right now. "
"19656380","19658900"," Just, uh, stop back in with you guys briefly."
"19659260","19664300"," So, right now what they're going to do is just destroy all options until you get a decision."
"19664660","19668400"," And it looks like they're only going to print stuff that are in the money at the close. "
"19668840","19675480"," So, be very wary of when we get in here, uh, for this, for this trade into this close, you're"
"19675480","19680800"," likely not, you're likely going to see them grind everything to dust and then whatever is left in"
"19680800","19681420"," the money here."
"19681680","19685160"," Uh, they will pay in either direction to the upper downside."
"19685160","19686260"," So, just be careful. "
"19687100","19691600"," Uh, if you're long in the market right now, they're re-pricing this market as we speak, just to"
"19691600","19692300"," heads up to that."
"19692820","19694320"," I'm not bearish or bullish here."
"19694420","19697600"," Just, uh, it's more like dealers with their vacuum cleaners out. "
"19697740","19698540"," It's just heads up on that."
"19701300","19705640"," So, we're looking out to the early market on close imbalance, currently sitting at 33 million to"
"19705640","19706160"," the buy side."

"19799720","19801620"," I was asked a question real quick."
"19801940","19807060"," Sorry, I'm going to quick break here on the PACW PacWest Bank Corp. "
"19807280","19809640"," Do I have any, um, thoughts on that?"
"19810700","19811240"," Uh, ticker."
"19811440","19812880"," I can bring that up for you real quick here."
"19813560","19815160"," Hang tighter for a second. "
"19825860","19827440"," Do I think it can go down any further?"
"19827680","19827800"," Sure."
"19827940","19833760"," I think it can go down easily, can go down to a new low down here to zero."
"19834140","19834500"," How about that?"
"19834880","19835320"," I'm just kidding. "
"19836140","19841080"," Uh, what do I think about the merger and the price of PACW?"
"19845120","19847240"," You've got no trade here right now."
"19847480","19849660"," So, well, let's take a look at it."
"19849660","19850800"," Let's take it here. "
"19859090","19863850"," So, on PACW, okay, in a 30 minute chart, I want you to see something here."
"19863970","19868990"," If you're trying to check these bars out here or here, okay?"
"19870550","19871970"," It's PACW right here."
"19872150","19877370"," So, if you guys are looking for unread messages on chat, no. "
"19881350","19883010"," So, there's 10 bucks, okay?"
"19884950","19885830"," Unpack W."
"19886490","19889170"," Uh, I want you to also see something though here."
"19889310","19890850"," You see this yellow right here?"
"19895820","19897320"," Um, you've got nothing."
"19897440","19898280"," I'll be honest with you. "
"19898380","19907280"," So, right here on PACW, uh, you are below, you are below 815."
"19907640","19908140"," That's bearish."
"19908240","19908840"," I want you to know that. "
"19909000","19909540"," That's bearish."
"19909700","19912600"," Okay, price is below 815."
"19912920","19913520"," That's bearish. "
"19913900","19914680"," Okay, just be clear on this."
"19914680","19915880"," This is bearish."
"19916040","19918860"," You being below 815 is bearish. "
"19918860","19920200"," I don't care if you're trying to buy a dip."
"19920380","19921360"," I don't care what you're trying to do."
"19921840","19922720"," That's bearish. "
"19923020","19923260"," Okay?"
"19924080","19926460"," Uh, you have no trade to the upside on it."
"19927300","19928780"," Um, you got no trade."
"19929480","19934700"," Even if you were to take a trade here and it's going down even more as time passes, right?"
"19935380","19943520"," Um, you're talking about having to see price first come above a 12, right?"
"19943520","19945880"," Then fight to get above 860. "
"19946500","19950660"," You might have a trade between 860 and $10 right here."
"19951300","19953020"," But currently you've got nothing."
"19953320","19954600"," This is bearish as fuck. "
"19956300","19958620"," Okay, so no, you've got no trade."
"19959520","19964860"," Uh, if it reverses, you still have no trade unless you get above the 30 EMA."
"19965660","19967740"," And even then that trade is garbage. "
"19968600","19969160"," You know what I'm saying?"
"19969160","19974160"," Um, you need time for the hourly to come down."
"19976500","19978880"," You need time for the daily to stabilize."
"19978880","19984200"," You need time for the price to come back up and test the daily to get back up there to"
"19984200","19986160"," take that trade between $849. "
"19986320","19991960"," There's no trade for you that I can see, uh, on, uh, packed up you now."
"19992840","19994460"," Not under the microscope anymore."
"19997680","19999120"," Not under the microscope anymore. "
"19999260","20002740"," You know, this is a fascinating ticker to look at because we were just talking about this, right?"
"20003300","20006600"," When you're on this weekly, it's a very, a very emotional level, right?"
"20006780","20008100"," They sold down off this weekly."
"20009180","20012060"," Uh, you've been working hard, working hard, working hard, working hard."
"20012220","20013640"," And I can actually go pretty deep. "
"20014200","20016280"," Uh, wouldn't be shocked to see three bucks."
"20016520","20017180"," I'll be honest with you."
"20017320","20019160"," Uh, or, or even sub $3. "
"20019900","20023780"," We're there back on, uh, may have, may have made third of 2023."
"20024000","20031960"," So, um, if anything, uh, if anything, it'd be trying to short, uh, 857, to be honest with you, 857,"
"20032120","20033040"," I'd be trying to short."
"20033420","20038220"," You have no trade unless it gets above that 857, zero, nothing. "
"20039360","20041060"," Uh, unless it gets above $89."
"20042060","20044920"," Otherwise, uh, you're going to be looking to test these lows down here."
"20044960","20045860"," You're going to test 691. "
"20046500","20051340"," You're going to test, uh, 630 and you are going to test, uh, 420 and three bucks."
"20052160","20057220"," Um, it'll be a zigzag all the way down, not straight down, but you have no bullish trade here."
"20057540","20063340"," Unless you get above an all honesty right now, uh, $8.54, even at a reversal. "
"20063880","20067040"," You got nothing unless you're above that number and you test it and hold it."
"20067380","20071480"," It's like you need to see price go up and test it."
"20072040","20073380"," Uh, and then head higher. "
"20075900","20078700"," And if you were long, I'll say something else to you."
"20078760","20083220"," If you're long, if let's say you were long, P-A-C-W, if you were long and trapped in"
"20083220","20086300"," here, if you think they're going to come back and save you right now today."
"20087060","20088480"," Uh, sorry, that's not happening. "
"20089300","20090320"," They're going to put the pain on you."
"20091560","20094520"," So I got nothing for you with, um, PACT-W right now."
"20100960","20105380"," Yeah, I see the, um, the halts right now, but my point to you is there's nothing. "
"20105980","20108040"," Uh, you've got no trade right now."
"20108600","20109540"," On that news."
"20109820","20110300"," You got nothing. "
"20110560","20111080"," You got zero."
"20111480","20119180"," If you were long, like, um, if you were long underlying, I wouldn't sell, but, um, the, the pain"
"20119180","20120180"," trade will likely be on."
"20134650","20138450"," It's a, you know, the thing, you know, I want to make one more comment here about, uh, PACT-W. "
"20139090","20144870"," So when you guys get these tools from me, you guys are going to be able to day trade this"
"20144870","20145150"," stuff."
"20145270","20150690"," This is a prime taker, PACT-W, uh, where you want to have that tool in front of you so"
"20150690","20158310"," that you can manage that trade and, uh, you want to be able to manage that trade and, um, actively"
"20158310","20159050"," watch it."
"20159170","20161330"," Like, having it on the show is one thing. "
"20161550","20163250"," Like, hey, what does he think about this?"
"20163250","20163690"," It's good."
"20164210","20167550"," But, uh, those kind of tickers, you want to have that tool right in front of you."
"20167570","20168930"," So you know where your stops are. "
"20169270","20170210"," You know where to long."
"20170930","20175030"," Uh, and we have a big white paper that we've been writing in the background and we've been"
"20175030","20181170"," improving it and acting out or adding to it and things like that so that, uh, you guys will have"
"20181170","20185310"," like an idea of, uh, the same stuff that we see."
"20193550","20196210"," Yeah, I guess we're going to focus on the trade. "
"20196390","20202150"," If we were to look at PACT-W, uh, like from now into close or now into tomorrow, we could"
"20202150","20204010"," say, yeah, let's take along here."
"20204830","20207290"," Um, let's like, let's do this."
"20207450","20208030"," Let's do that. "
"20208850","20210430"," Uh, but my thoughts on it."
"20210430","20217630"," Uh, normally even what regardless of what the news is, uh, that there's likely a pain trade"
"20217630","20219350"," involved, uh, still which sucks."
"20219670","20223450"," Not guaranteed, but you're like 70% of the time with that kind of a sell like that. "
"20223650","20224610"," You're going to see a pain trade."
"20228260","20228680"," Yeah."
"20228940","20229020"," Yeah. "
"20231600","20233860"," I like you're going to see some of the pain trade on that."
"20235520","20236620"," It sucks to say."
"20240380","20242240"," And you'd have to actively manage it. "
"20242240","20246780"," I believe in the half back trade, mean revision trade, whatever you want to call it."
"20246840","20248660"," I believe in that, but when does it happen?"
"20249760","20252040"," Um, you know, it's fucked up about that trade too."
"20252560","20256380"," As it typically takes place, uh, faster. "
"20258100","20260840"," If it's an upside move, then a downside move."
"20261440","20266040"," Like if, if, if, if PACT-W had gone up, I'd be like, fuck yeah, short that shit down into"
"20266040","20266340"," the close."
"20267380","20269980"," When we go down like that, it typically takes longer. "
"20285970","20286410"," Okay."
"20286570","20286990"," I'm back here."
"20288190","20290770"," Um, bring book map back up. "
"20290910","20291310"," I apologize."
"20291530","20292470"," I thought I turned that off."
"20294250","20295230"," Turn that back on. "
"20300600","20302700"," Get everything set up for the after."
"20303080","20307400"," We're looking again now to the early market on close imbalance, still sitting at 33 million to the"
"20307400","20307800"," buy side."
"20311000","20313380"," So we turn and get some of this stuff turned out enough. "
"20319440","20319840"," Okay."
"20325350","20325910"," All right."
"20326170","20330090"," So this, uh, this yellow box here is now down here with the green box, right?"
"20330230","20332190"," This is your buy and sell zone down here. "
"20332190","20333810"," Now you're white and red liner down here."
"20333810","20335290"," We're going to get rid of both of these."
"20336190","20338750"," So you can get a clear shot into the close here. "
"20340590","20344010"," We're going to look at, you guys know, you guys have my take on tomorrow."
"20344010","20344870"," I'll give you guys a quick."
"20344970","20345870"," It's 3.40 in the afternoon. "
"20346130","20347830"," We'll give you a quick five minute what to expect tomorrow."
"20348370","20350370"," So you guys have access to it."
"20353310","20357390"," Sorry, review what to expect from at least price action into tomorrow. "
"20358050","20360410"," I want to make a couple of things clear for you."
"20360410","20364450"," I will be here with you tomorrow to do this fed rate decision."
"20364750","20368770"," I usually have a pretty good idea of what they're saying and what the news release is. "
"20370250","20375310"," I have it can be pretty insightful into the implications of what those mean."
"20376210","20378390"," Before you even get it from the news squawks."
"20379210","20382930"," If it's good bad or whatever, whatever you need to know for an actionable trade plan. "
"20383170","20385170"," You guys have heard if you guys are just tuning in."
"20386030","20388650"," I already went through all of this this morning."
"20389950","20392210"," On the expansion of the options chain. "
"20392410","20395170"," I went through selling options."
"20396150","20399430"," I went through everything I think at this point."
"20399610","20402330"," I've been leading up to this the past couple days. "
"20402330","20406550"," So if if you've been a person that's been in the stream every day."
"20407090","20408870"," You get the benefit of that."
"20410970","20413190"," Wait a minute, meet that right there. "
"20416190","20418230"," And we're going to look at what to expect."
"20420610","20425450"," So you have a firm idea of what to expect coming into tomorrow."
"20425990","20427610"," So here's a five minute chart. "
"20430710","20431610"," Traded this down."
"20431810","20432290"," Traded sideways."
"20432790","20433210"," Traded it up. "
"20433870","20435950"," We know the early trigger where it is."
"20436190","20437310"," We're going to check on that."
"20437470","20439030"," Make sure we got a decent. "
"20442250","20444930"," The grasp of where we are and where it's going to be tomorrow."
"20448980","20451120"," We got four fifty five right in here."
"20453360","20457260"," You can expect this into tomorrow to come up. "
"20458540","20460060"," So four fifty five."
"20460520","20463260"," Early trigger just keeps coming higher and higher and higher."
"20465700","20466600"," Into tomorrow. "
"20466820","20468200"," We know where the sellers are right."
"20468380","20469680"," We knew where the yellow box was."
"20469820","20471040"," We knew where the red box was. "
"20471340","20473560"," We know that the sellers are still here."
"20474420","20475560"," This was the red box."
"20475840","20476660"," Not the yellow box. "
"20477620","20479020"," The yellow box was lower."
"20479200","20479860"," Those are the weak sellers."
"20480740","20482920"," We know these are the strong sellers up in here. "
"20483720","20485600"," We know we've got our three up here."
"20485600","20488220"," We know we have an expected move tomorrow."
"20489280","20493180"," That is, I don't know why it's not shown on this chart right here, but the expected move for"
"20493180","20498280"," tomorrow is I believe four fifty nine sixty. "
"20500660","20502200"," If I'm wrong on that, let me know."
"20502300","20504260"," But I think it's four fifty nine thirty or sixty."
"20504700","20509460"," That's the, maybe because I switched charts, but that's the expected move to the upside. "
"20509820","20513440"," The expected move for the downside is roughly four fifty."
"20514460","20515580"," Somewhere right down."
"20515660","20516860"," It's four fifty two, maybe. "
"20517300","20518640"," I think it's somewhere in here."
"20518860","20520800"," This is the expected move to the downside tomorrow."
"20521440","20522720"," If I'm wrong on that, correct me. "
"20523440","20524640"," Had the numbers earlier."
"20526480","20528000"," Now we know some stuff, right?"
"20528180","20528500"," Going in tomorrow."
"20529300","20531340"," We know that the sellers are here. "
"20532260","20534100"," We know that at any point."
"20537240","20538120"," Any point."
"20538920","20541660"," We get a great market reaction to the news. "
"20542520","20544560"," That the market hedge is going to come off."
"20544780","20545000"," Okay."
"20546420","20548880"," And we're going to rip some fucking faces off on that news. "
"20550540","20552300"," But you know where the hedge is right here."
"20554880","20557760"," Some people are going to disagree with you on this, but I'm going to say to you here, they're going"
"20557760","20563100"," to think they're going to tell you that bad, bad tech earnings leads to a down move."
"20563260","20563800"," That's not true. "
"20564720","20566720"," The market doesn't give a fuck about earnings."
"20567440","20568840"," The indexes will come right back."
"20569440","20572100"," Sometimes we get some weakness, but they really don't give a fuck. "
"20573060","20575740"," If we squeeze up on earnings, I expect them to come back."
"20576100","20581960"," So my point here is price action here probably is not directly related to ERs."
"20583020","20587420"," There should still be a hedge coming into tomorrow until like eleven thirty in the morning. "
"20588300","20593600"," So even if we get good earnings, I would expect them to roll down or be sold down into tomorrow"
"20593600","20593940"," morning."
"20594180","20594680"," That's my take."
"20595700","20599740"," That you're going to get a hedge into tomorrow for the hourly trigger. "
"20600820","20603040"," They're going to try to pin underneath the hourly."
"20603380","20605620"," Any market on closing balance is still sitting at thirty."
"20607060","20607780"," Hold on here. "
"20609220","20612000"," They're going to pin us try attempt to pin us."
"20613600","20615080"," You know, this isn't bad."
"20615200","20616000"," These aren't bad people. "
"20616160","20619700"," These are people like me with owning the underlying market."
"20619920","20621640"," There's no reason not to hedge an event."
"20621640","20624760"," So it makes rational sense to hedge the event. "
"20625140","20629620"," You're also likely going to see, believe it or not, some kind of panic selling down here."
"20629820","20630500"," I would not be."
"20630600","20638900"," I wouldn't be shocked to see some kind of like last minute fucking 145 in the afternoon blast down"
"20638900","20639640"," to 452. "
"20640140","20642440"," Even if we are going to rip faces off to the upside."
"20643660","20646980"," And some kind of a failure here and here."
"20647480","20649880"," Now this is a pretty big move expected for tomorrow. "
"20650400","20652080"," Make sure I get these numbers right."
"20652260","20654380"," But basically that's what I'm expecting for tomorrow."
"20654380","20660200"," It's 2 p.m. Now if you're a dip buyer, if you want to be a dip buyer, I want"
"20660200","20662800"," to show you the place for you to be a dip buyer into tomorrow. "
"20663320","20665620"," If you get anything hawkish, it's going to be way down here."
"20668000","20669820"," 456, 457, somewhere down there."
"20669920","20670700"," Make sure it's still valid. "
"20673580","20675400"," Yeah, right around 444."
"20675700","20677000"," Maybe it's slightly lower."
"20677220","20677680"," Let's make it. "
"20677860","20679800"," Let's make it right down here."
"20681240","20684040"," 445 for tomorrow for a dip buy."
"20684260","20685160"," So pretty big, right?"
"20685420","20685960"," Move to the downside. "
"20686900","20689780"," If you get like a weak market down here, right?"
"20690060","20693040"," You get underneath the hourly trigger and then boom, you get a bloodbath down here."
"20693120","20694040"," It could go that low."
"20694880","20698920"," I'll check the expected move again right now just to make sure I got this correct because I might"
"20698920","20699420"," have it wrong. "
"20701080","20701860"," Hold on here."
"20707220","20708520"," Make sure I got this right."
"20709860","20711080"," Give me a second here. "
"20719420","20724920"," I don't have a, I don't really like the excuses for why the market sells like, oh, it was because"
"20724920","20725740"," we had bad earnings."
"20726380","20727240"," There is some of that."
"20727380","20729160"," There's a sentiment part that takes place. "
"20730240","20733320"," But truly nobody gives a fuck about earnings right now."
"20733380","20734660"," They care about one fucking thing."
"20734940","20735720"," I'm really honest with you. "
"20736060","20736900"," It's this fucking event."
"20737760","20739220"," It's where the volatility is."
"20739420","20741600"," It's the one thing that's unknown to the marketplace. "
"20741600","20743460"," So I want you to be aware of that."
"20743920","20747420"," That this market cares about one fucking thing right now."
"20747480","20749620"," And that is the Fed tomorrow. "
"20750320","20754780"," So into tomorrow's expiry got a 459.07 and 452."
"20755880","20764480"," 452.58. So 459.07. So right here."
"20765300","20766960"," This is your expected move tomorrow. "
"20768020","20772220"," This is what the dealers have priced in for tomorrow."
"20773080","20774900"," We know the sellers are right here."
"20777140","20781280"," So you're going to probably see some kind of, you know, push it down here. "
"20781980","20783920"," Push it down here, grind it down."
"20784560","20789080"," You get that little bit of a weakness and then a move higher or a grab of liquidity and the"
"20789080","20789560"," move lower."
"20790500","20792120"," I want you to be aware of a couple of things here. "
"20792280","20793540"," You don't have to trade these events."
"20793920","20796760"," There's no need for you to trade these events."
"20796960","20800080"," These events are made for you to lose all of your money. "
"20800160","20801400"," I'm going to warn you of something here."
"20801560","20801680"," Okay."
"20801920","20806560"," Take my fucking, take my fucking warning on this. "
"20807160","20813080"," You'll have hindsight 2020 vision and be like, fuck Captain Jim James."
"20813280","20814240"," I should have taken the long."
"20815200","20819900"," You'll have 20, 20 vision and say, fuck it. "
"20819980","20821740"," I should have taken the puts into tomorrow."
"20821940","20830480"," Like this whole shit in here is it's like, if you think you think there's gambling, shit like this"
"20830480","20832840"," is like some of the worst trading you can do."
"20833600","20839000"," If you want to do a lot of trade or something or sell some calls above, sell some puts below,"
"20839540","20840600"," you can do that kind of shit. "
"20841620","20845100"," There's no expectation of us trading higher or lower into Friday."
"20845660","20851480"," Options market has this priced in right into Friday, right into Friday."
"20852160","20853220"," You know, there's just no need. "
"20853460","20854280"," There's no requirements."
"20855520","20856720"," To trade this."
"20857180","20864020"," So you're going to be looking for, you're going to be looking for the Fed meeting decision and then"
"20864020","20865960"," probably get trapped in here. "
"20866700","20871520"," And the market will await an expansion to the upside or an expansion to the downside."
"20872540","20876440"," I'm telling you, this after trade is where the money is at."
"20876980","20878540"," Not this trade here. "
"20879360","20883940"," If you're not, if you're a simple trader, no fucking reason to trade this shit tomorrow."
"20883980","20884820"," I'll be honest with you."
"20885480","20886780"," The hedge is on right here. "
"20887120","20887680"," You can see it."
"20888400","20890220"," Now, there's a cup and handle forming here."
"20890300","20892060"," We got a new high that's positive for the bulls. "
"20892700","20893660"," You see the cup."
"20894100","20898900"," I don't like traditional charting, but you know, you're something like that and boom, you rip up."
"20899700","20904580"," So even if you're trying to position yourself as a bull for tomorrow, it's probably not right here. "
"20905240","20910880"," You're probably waiting until some weakness tomorrow to even take that long."
"20911340","20916760"," So if you're trying to trade the rate decision, it's likely not right now."
"20916880","20917180"," It's tomorrow. "
"20918320","20918980"," Another thing."
"20919120","20924240"," Another note from this morning was that another note from this morning, we got 10 minutes left."
"20924700","20931860"," Another note from this morning is that another note from this morning is, sorry, I'm trying to"
"20931860","20935680"," think of what I'm going to put some calls on in here, so I want to make sure I get"
"20935680","20936160"," time here. "
"20937440","20941260"," Another note from this morning is that you're going to see a re-pricing of options."
"20942380","20947560"," So if you've got options over here, you know, you're going to see a fucking re-pricing multiple"
"20947560","20948220"," times."
"20948220","20953140"," You'll see two or three re-pricings in here and you're going to see further re-pricings as soon as"
"20953140","20954380"," that event ball wears off. "
"20954700","20956020"," You're going to see some major re-pricing."
"20956200","20963300"," So if you're in calls or puts that are farther out in time and you get a print, I'd fucking"
"20963300","20965580"," take that money and renegotiate that trade."
"20966460","20966700"," Okay. "
"20967240","20968740"," So you're seeing the trade up."
"20968920","20970640"," You're seeing the hedge down into the close."
"20971320","20976900"," If you're a long all day long, there's no reason for you not to be hedging this event down into"
"20976900","20979060"," tomorrow at this point. "
"20979540","20979740"," Okay."
"20980080","20981020"," Just be aware of that."
"20981380","20983860"," We've got some earnings coming up here in the next few minutes. "
"20984340","20986040"," I'm going to put those up for you right now."
"20987400","20993740"," If you're trying to, if you're trying to place a bet on those earnings, you likely need to take"
"20993740","20994920"," that bet in the money."
"20994920","21001300"," If you're going to do it, if you're going to do it, if you're going to take that synthetic bet"
"21001300","21007800"," inside of this EZR reports, right now they're destroying the options. "
"21007920","21011020"," Tina, I let you know earlier as I was taking my break."
"21011940","21017100"," So you're going to be looking for, Goog is probably the one that I like here that I want to"
"21017100","21017560"," be watching."
"21022610","21024290"," Here's the hourly trigger on Google. "
"21029170","21030510"," Estimated move right here."
"21030690","21031890"," Expected move I should say."
"21032510","21034330"," Coming into its hourly trigger right now. "
"21034930","21036190"," Expected move up or down."
"21036530","21037830"," I think they have the best chance."
"21039290","21041070"," We've got MSFT here. "
"21044090","21048310"," Misfit coming up on bounced on their hourly trigger this morning, trading higher."
"21050210","21051010"," Daily trigger down below."
"21051490","21052930"," Expected move down here at 330. "
"21054430","21055610"," Expected move to the upside."
"21057650","21059750"," Is that down a little bit for you?"
"21060910","21063270"," Seriously, what the fuck is going on with?"
"21066910","21070430"," There's Microsoft, and then we've got Snap over here."
"21073470","21075390"," Snap is the one that I like. "
"21075890","21084990"," If you're looking for volatility, like maybe buy the underlying and sell it, this one is primed for"
"21084990","21085970"," a huge move."
"21085970","21092060"," I don't know why that's not showing up right now."
"21093560","21099140"," I don't think I have enough time to do this one, but this one right here specifically is going to"
"21099140","21099680"," get violent. "
"21100540","21102880"," Looking for an 18% move in Snap."
"21106080","21107780"," Yeah, they're pricing everything out right now."
"21107860","21108220"," They're murdering. "
"21109540","21112000"," All 4.56s are now 53 cents."
"21115340","21119180"," I'm going to get rid of, hold on a second here."
"21122660","21124460"," I'm going to get rid of these color bars now. "
"21139990","21141430"," We'll go back to a one minute chart."
"21150310","21152770"," Let me know in the chat where you guys are longer shorted."
"21152850","21156350"," I'm trying to buy a bunch of calls here on the bell. "
"21157210","21158590"," If we can catch a red bar down."
"21160370","21166410"," If at any point we can catch a red bar down, like panic bar or something like that, like 401."
"21166410","21170170"," And then we actually get some good earnings. "
"21170630","21173870"," If you hear good news, just rip this thing bad boy up."
"21174650","21176710"," Go back there and retest our two."
"21176930","21182230"," If you're looking to put on some puts or a hedge into the close for tomorrow and you missed this"
"21182230","21188390"," down move, you might get another opportunity to hedge tomorrow at four o'clock for 15. "
"21189050","21190210"," If there are good earnings."
"21191030","21193710"," So if you're like, hey, I never got to put a hedge on for tomorrow and I want to."
"21194350","21195170"," Hey, I'm super bearish. "
"21195170","21197170"," I didn't get to sell the new high."
"21197750","21205230"," You can certainly get another chance to take that trade into the close right here."
"21205390","21205990"," So there's Google. "
"21211000","21212040"," There's MSFT."
"21214200","21219200"," I think the best chance of it up move is likely going to be Google and not Microsoft."
"21220120","21221980"," I think Microsoft to sell the news. "
"21222320","21223840"," I think Google has a chance to go up."
"21225500","21227380"," And we've got Snap coming in."
"21227520","21230060"," This is likely the most volatile trade here into this close. "
"21230540","21232520"," I appreciate you guys all showing up here today."
"21232980","21234720"," Five minutes left until this close."
"21236900","21240320"," Let me see what's going on. "
"21246920","21249840"," We're not even near the fucking hourly trigger right now."
"21250600","21252780"," Four fifty four sixty six."
"21253760","21255740"," Our only triggers way down here. "
"21258820","21260220"," And snap that in there."
"21263840","21268360"," Tim, I might actually take every time I think I'm buying fucking puts."
"21268620","21268880"," I'm like. "
"21270220","21272100"," Every time I think I'm buying puts."
"21273640","21277820"," I'm like, yeah, you know, if we actually went down this deep, I might actually buy calls in this"
"21277820","21278060"," close."
"21284600","21285420"," Why am I not?"
"21285640","21286640"," Why is this thing not snapping?"
"21286820","21287680"," I don't know what's going on here. "
"21291140","21294760"," Can't seem to put a, you're just going to have to know that."
"21295040","21296800"," I don't know what's going on here."
"21298800","21299660"," Escape to cancel. "
"21300080","21300240"," Okay."
"21300740","21304280"," So just heads up right down here is where the hourly trigger is."
"21304320","21309100"," If we ever get down to this deep into this close, I will likely buy calls for tomorrow down here. "
"21309740","21314440"," So if we can go down that deep, I will buy those calls, trading the R1 right now into this"
"21314440","21314640"," close."
"21342450","21343990"," Just a few minutes left here."
"21344090","21345290"," I've got some calls lined up. "
"21349160","21352100"," My Google, Google trading, it's hourly trigger."

"21452270","21454790"," Get some calls lined up here for after the bell."
"21454950","21458070"," I want to see if we can get a bloodbath after the spell, the first minute or two."
"21459030","21461790"," And if they get good earnings, I'll buy some calls to the upside. "
